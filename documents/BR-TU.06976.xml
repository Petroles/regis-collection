ABSTRACT 

 

This research integrated geological, hydrogeological, geochemical, and stable 

isotope studies conducted in the municipality of Sete Lagoas (MG), Brazil, in order to 

understand the water circulation in a karst terrain and to propose alternatives for a 

better water use, aiming to avoid geotechnical problems. The area is constituted by 

Neoproterozoic limestones from the Sete Lagoas Formation, where karst conduits 

were developed, giving origin to the homonymous aquifer, which is covered by 

Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments and, occasionally, by Neoproterozoic 

metasedimentary rocks from the Serra de Santa Helena Formation. It was observed 

that in this aquifer the primary porosity is very low and the secondary porosity (micro-

fractures) is also reduced, due to the filling by calcite. The great volume of 

groundwater migrates through the tertiary porosity characterized by two dominant 

solutionally enlarged bedding planes and, to a lesser extent, by sub-vertical enlarged 

fractures. The recharge, related to rainfall occurring from October to December, takes 

place through sinkholes, caves entrances, and where the limestones are under the 

Cenozoic sediments. A detailed study evaluating the scale effects also allowed the 

establishment of permeability distributions of the Sete Lagoas Aquifer. Other results 

obtained also established that the groundwater extractions are associated to karst 

geotechnical events located in the urbanized area of the municipality. The high 

groundwater extractions make the shallowest solutionally enlarged bedding plane, in 

some points, entirely in the unsaturated zone, causing geotechnical events. A 

geotechnical map identifies five levels of risk, based on the lithology and the 

groundwater level interaction. This type of mapping should guide the groundwater 

extractions and caring the urban land occupation in Sete Lagoas, preventing or 

delaying the occurrence of new subsidences or collapses. 

 

Keywords: hydrogeology, karst, geotechnical risk, geochemistry, stable isotopes.

RESUMO 

 

Esta pesquisa integrou estudos geológicos, hidrogeológicos, geoquímicos e de 

isótopos estáveis no município de Sete Lagoas (MG), Brasil, com o objetivo de 

entender a circulação da água em terreno cárstico e propor alternativas para o seu 

melhor uso, a fim de se evitar problemas geotécnicos. A área é constituída por 

calcários neoproterozoicos da Formação Sete Lagoas, onde se desenvolveram 

condutos cársticos, dando origem ao aquífero homônimo, o qual está coberto por 

sedimentos cenozoicos inconsolidados e, ocasionalmente, por rochas 

metasedimentares neoproterozoicas da Formação Serra de Santa Helena. Foi 

observado que neste aquífero a porosidade primária é muito baixa e a secundária 

(micro-fraturas) é igualmente reduzida, devido ao preenchimento por calcita. O 

grande volume de água subterrânea migra através da porosidade terciária 

caracterizada dominantemente por dois planos de acamamentos carstificados e, em 

menor grau, por fraturas sub-verticais carstificadas. A recarga, relacionada às 

chuvas que ocorrem no período de outubro a dezembro, se dá através de 

sumidouros, entradas de cavernas e onde o calcário está sob os sedimentos 

cenozoicos. Um detalhado estudo avaliando os efeitos de escala permitiu também o 

estabelecimento da distribuição das permeabilidades do Aquífero Sete Lagoas. 

Outros resultados obtidos também estabeleceram que as extrações de águas 

subterrâneas estão associadas aos eventos geotécnicos cársticos localizados na 

área urbana do município. A elevada extração das águas subterrâneas faz com que 

o plano de acamamento carstificado mais raso, em algumas áreas, esteja 

inteiramente na zona não saturada, provocando os eventos geotécnicos. Um mapa 

de risco geotécnico identifica, a partir da litologia e do nível de água subterrânea, 

cinco níveis. Este tipo de mapeamento deveria orientar as extrações e os cuidados 

na ocupação do terreno urbano em Sete Lagoas, prevenindo ou retardando a 

ocorrência de novas subsidências ou colapsos.

Chapter 1: Introduction 

Doctoral Thesis 1 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 

 

1.1 Presentation 

 

The doctoral thesis was a result of a research that integrated geological, 

hydrogeological, geochemical, and stable isotope studies conducted in the 

municipality of Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. This region has a population 

greater than 200,000, over an area of 538 km
2
, where the urban development was 

more intense in the central portion of this municipality. Geologically, the area is 

located in the São Francisco Craton, where carbonate argillo-arenaceous sediments 

are emplaced giving origin to the Bambuí Group. In this group, karst conduits in the 

limestones from the Sete Lagoas Formation were developed, which are storing a 

large amount of groundwater. Because of this, the current water supply is almost 

entirely groundwater from the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer. As it is common in 

developing countries like Brazil, mostly cities has rapid urban growth having not 

always been guided by planning, reflecting sometimes in water supply problems for 

local populations. These features also take place in Sete Lagoas, with an 

aggravating factor: the location of this city in a karst region, which problems related to 

geotechnical issues caused by groundwater exploitation, as well as problems in 

water supply during dry season, are common. The results obtained in this 

multidisciplinary research, where some methodologies used in this thesis were never 

applied for karst regions, especially in Brazil, were used to understand the water 

circulation in this karst terrain and its behaviors with others geological formations, 

and then giving alternative responses for a better use of water, mitigating problems 

related to that. 

 

1.2 Objectives and justifications 

 

The main goal of this thesis was to characterize quantitatively and qualitatively 

the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer and its relationship with other rock formations in order 

to understand: (1) the underlying mechanisms that control the water circulation; (2) 

the possible origin of groundwater recharge and its flowpaths; (3) the multi-scale 

permeability structure evaluation (in small-, well-, and regional-scale); and (4) the 

physical mechanisms of subsidence and collapse development. Investigating all 



Chapter 1: Introduction 

Doctoral Thesis 2 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

these mechanisms is important because of the increasing demands on this karst 

aquifer, which require users to have a better understanding of how it functions, so 

that it can be properly utilized and protected, avoiding water resource degradations, 

as well as facilitating stakeholder decision making in urban planning. 

 

1.3 Structure of this thesis 

 

This doctoral thesis is organized in the form of scientific papers, which were 

published, accepted and submitted to international journals. Thus, each chapter can 

be read relatively independently to the others. After the Chapter 1 "Introduction", it is 

presented the Chapter 2 containing the site descriptions and its hydrogeological 

features.  

The Chapter 3 is about the main methods used in the research to understand 

the circulation of groundwater and its relationships in karst terrains, while the Chapter 

4 is the state of art "Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts".  

The Chapter 5 contains the paper "Geologic conceptual model of the 

municipality of Sete Lagoas (MG, Brazil) and the surroundings", accepted in the 

Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciências [Annals of the Brazilian Academy of 

Sciences] (Galvão et al. in press). This paper was important to understand, firstly, the 

spatial distribution and the structural framework geometry to establish a new geologic 

perspective of the region before developing the other papers. 

The Chapter 6 presents the paper "Evaluating karst geotechnical risk in the 

urbanized area of Sete Lagoas, MG, Brazil", already published in the Hydrogeology 

Journal (Galvão et al. 2015). The primary goal of this paper was to evaluate and 

identify the potential subsidence or collapse risk zones. Aerial photographs, lithologic 

well profiles, optical well logs, and geologic mapping were utilized to categorize risk 

factors influencing karst subsidence and collapse, using an index system. The results 

showed that the majority of the urbanized area overlies mantled limestone from the 

Sete Lagoas Formation covered with unconsolidated sediments contained within a 

graben, resulting in barrier boundaries for groundwater. Five risks zones in the 

municipality were identified (negligible, low, moderate, considerable, and high) 

related to geologic and hydrologic risk factors. The urbanized area is located largely 

in the high-risk zone where the majority of the collapse features are located.  



Chapter 1: Introduction 

Doctoral Thesis 3 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

The Chapter 7 contains the paper "The karst permeability scale effect of Sete 

Lagoas, MG, Brazil", submitted in the Journal of Hydrology (Galvão et al. in review). 

The Sete Lagoas karst aquifer was used to evaluate the permeability structure across 

a range of scales in order to develop a quantitative model of permeable features that 

is consistent across all scales of measurement, from matrix properties to regional-

scale flow. This aquifer has some wells that do not have measurable drawdown 

during pumping due to high permeability. Based on bulk permeability measurements, 

inverted estimate of the size of hydraulic features, and the permeability combination 

forward modeling, the results indicated an increase in permeabilities from the matrix- 

to well-scale, but a decrease of these parameters from well- to regional-scale due to 

the localized development of karst bedding plane dissolution in one structurally 

controlled region of the aquifer. The physical sizes of permeable features of the 

aquifer are consistent across the scales of data collection and their geometry 

provides a quantitative understanding of the scale effects of permeability 

measurements. 

The Chapter 8 presents the paper "Stable isotopes and geochemical studies to 

evaluate flowpaths and recharge areas in an urban karst aquifer in Sete Lagoas, MG, 

Brazil", to be submitted in the Annals of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences. The 

main goal was identify indirectly the various sources and areas of recharge in the 

karst area, its flowpaths, and surface-ground water interaction, which is important for 

proper water resource management, avoiding eventual contaminations and other 

future water quality problems. Analyzing data of stable isotopes 
18

O and 
2
H and 

major ions measurements, it was possible to understand that the origin of 

groundwater is directly from precipitation, having a limited period of recharge. In the 

central urbanized area, where the karst aquifer is in contact with Cenozoic 

unconsolidated sediments, there may be punctual superficial water infiltration. The 

major ions concentrations presented the highest values at the same region, where 

the most developed karstic structure was found in the Sete Lagoas Formation. These 

data could suggest larger water reservoir indicating more mineralization, which are in 

concordance with the geologic information.  

Chapter 9 consists in a synthesis of the overall conclusions acquired from all 

the results and discussions from the papers and general recommendations for future 

works.

CHAPTER 2: SITE DESCRIPTION 

 

The municipality of Sete Lagoas is located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, 

70 km northwest of Belo Horizonte, the state capital. This region has a population 

greater than 200,000 over an area of 538 km
2
 (IBGE 2010). The urban development 

was more intense in the northern and northeastern sectors, in comparison to the 

initial settlement (Fig. 1). There is a considerable industrial activity located mainly 

along the main federal highway, which is a corridor of significant growth. Rapid urban 

development has not always been guided by planning, especially in relation to 

environmental and geotechnical issues, reflected by 17 documented occurrences of 

subsidence or/and collapse since 1988 (Peñaranda J and Cordeiro A. 

Hydrogeologists, Servmar Environmental &amp;amp; Engineering, unpublished data, 2013). 

The majority of these occurrences are clustered in the central portion of the 

urbanized area, which the most important event happened in 1988 (Silva 1988), 

when a collapse having around a 20 meters in diameter was registered.

public supply wells, where the majority of them are located in the urban area, where it is 
possible to obtain the highest discharge rates in well. 



Chapter 2: Site descriptions 

Doctoral Thesis 5 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

Geologically, the area is located in the São Francisco Craton, where 

Neoproterozoic carbonate argillo-arenaceous sediments are emplaced giving origin 

to the Bambuí Group (Branco and Costa 1961, Oliveira 1967, Schöll and Fogaça 

1973, Dardene 1978, Schobbenhaus 1984, Ribeiro et al. 2003, Tuller et al. 2010). 

The statigraphy of the region can be seen in the Fig. 2.  

The Archaean basement is represented by the Belo Horizonte Complex, which 

is generally characterized by a set of gneissic rocks and migmatite zones, with 

polymetamorphic features, belonging to the geotectonic unit corresponding to the 

São Francisco Craton (Ribeiro et al. 2003). Epigenic and igneous 

metamorphic/migmatite rocks with plutonic features mark this occurrence. Mafic 

intrusions may also occur, which preferentially fills in the fracture planes. The 

contacts between different lithotypes are generally transitional, mainly between 

gneiss, migmatites and/or granitoids. The granitoids are light gray to white, with 

granulation varying from gross to medium, sometimes with sparse porphyroblasts of 

tabular feldspars, xenoliths from other rocks or restites from partial fusion (Tuller et 

al. 2010). This complex was intensely affected by basic injections, provoking the 

appearance of a group of basic rock dikes (Ribeiro et al. 2003).  

Overlying the basement, the Bambuí Group is represented by the lower Sete 

Lagoas Formation (Dardenne 1978) and the upper Serra de Santa Helena Formation 

(Branco and Costa 1961) (Fig. 2). The Sete Lagoas Formation is divided and 

characterized by two members (Ribeiro et al. 2003): Pedro Leopoldo, at the base, 

composed of fine limestones, dolomites, marlstones and pelites; and Lagoa Santa, 

on the top, composed of medium-grained black limestones. In general, the lower 

contact of this formation with rocks from the basement is abrupt, discordant and 

tectonic, with faults. The upper contact with the Serra de Santa Helena Formation is 

most commonly abrupt as well. The Serra de Santa Helena Formation is composed 

of slate, marble, siltstone and argillite. This formation overlies the Sete Lagoas 

Formation with abrupt, tectonic, or occasionally, gradational contacts. With the 

basement, the contacts are abrupt and discordant (angular discordance), tectonic, by 

thrust belt faults, easily seen on the basin border (Tuller et al. 2010). Three 

stratigraphic members constitute this formation (Grossi et al. 1998): (1) lower, 

represented by silt-clay rhythmites, generally carbonaceous, and dark shales; (2) 

middle, by marble and shales; and (3) upper, constituted by shales, siltstones, slate 

cleavage, and cross bedding.  



Chapter 2: Site descriptions 

Doctoral Thesis 6 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

The Bambuí Group is covered by the Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments, 

divided into (1) detritus coverage, (2) alluvial terraces, and (3) alluvium (Ribeiro et al. 

2003). The detritus coverage is composed of sediments with a predominant red color, 

sand to silt with varying levels of gravel, which occur indistinctly on all units, but 

mainly over the Serra de Santa Helena Formation. The alluvial terraces occur along 

drainages and are mainly constituted of semi-consolidated sand to silt material, with 

whitish to yellowish and reddish color. The alluvium occurs along the meanders of the 

large watercourses. They are composed of fine to coarse sand, with discontinuous 

amounts of quartz pebbles, siltstone and sandstone (Tuller et al. 2010). 

Geomorphologically, the area is in a karst setting, which provides the presence 

of lakes (located mainly in the central area), caves, sinkholes, and closed drainage 

basins (Pessoa 1996, Ribeiro et al. 2003, Tuller et al. 2010). Areas that have denser 

drainage are related to the Santa Helena Ridge foothills in the center, basement 

outcrops in the south, and metasediments in the north. The elevation of the area 

ranges from around 750 to 1000 m, declining from southwest to northeast, where the 

highest elevations are located in the Santa Helena Ridge (Fig. 2).  

Regarding the hydrogeology, the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer consists of 

Neoproterozoic limestones, which the groundwater is predominantly classified as a 

calcium-bicarbonate type, with pH values between 6.5 and 7.5, being slightly basic. 

Regarding the electrical conductivity, this groundwater has an average of 333 

?mhos/cm, combining with the high levels of dissolved salts (calcium and 

bicarbonate). This water, stored in karst conduits, offers good quality for human 

consumption, only presenting a light level of water hardness, sometimes causing an 

unpleasant taste and problems of encrustation in pipes with smaller diameter 

(Pessoa 1996). These limestones dip and become thicker and completely covered by 

competent rocks from the Serra de Santa Helena Formation to the northeast, 

considered as the local aquiclude. The Belo Horizonte basement works as a fissure 

aquifer, where the groundwater is stored in the fractures/faults, which is an 

alternative source of groundwater for the municipality.  

Because of these hydrogeological features, the current municipal water supply 

is almost entirely groundwater from the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer, with less 

contribution from the basement, which is managed by the Water Supply and Sewage 

Service (SAAE) [SAAE - Serviço Autônomo de Água e Esgoto]. For these, this

company has more than 100 public wells located especially in the urbanized area, 

where it is possible to obtain the highest discharge rates (Fig. 1).  

The mean total monthly precipitation is 106 mm, while the total annual is 1271.8 

mm. The rainy season occurs from October to March, with total rainfall of 1132 mm, 

accounting for 89% of annual precipitation. The period with less precipitation occurs 

from April to September, with 139 mm. The average annual temperature is 20.9 ºC, 

with July having the lowest monthly mean value (17.5 °C), and February the highest 

one (22.9 °C). The annual variation is around 5°C. According to Pessoa (1996), the 

water balance in Sete Lagoas is divided, monthly, in: (1) water excess from January 

to March; (2) water deficit from April to September; and (3) water replacement 

between October and December, the period of recharging.

CHAPTER 3: MATERIALS AND METHODS  

 

To achieve the objectives of the thesis, several different methods were utilized 

and developed. For better understanding, these methodologies will be separated by 

geological and hydrogeological approaches. For geological issues, geologic 

mapping, aerial photography interpretation, lithologic well profiles, and optical well log 

analysis were made. For hydrogeological issues, pumping tests were run, and water 

table measurements were made. Groundwater samples, superficial water and 

rainwater were collected for stable isotopes analysis and just groundwater samples 

were used for chemical analysis of major ions. These sets of data were integrated to 

be evaluated analytically and empirically to understand the mechanisms of the water 

circulation in the local karst aquifer and its relationships between other geological 

formations. These methods are presented sequentially followed by the approach to 

data integration. 

 

3.1 Geological approaches 

 

3.1.1 Geologic mapping 

Geologic mapping of the Sete Lagoas was carried out in a scale of 1:25,000. 

The classification of the sedimentary rocks followed the definitions of Folk (1980) and 

the microscopic classification of the carbonate rocks followed the definitions of Folk 

(1959) and Dunham (1962). For the metamorphic and igneous rocks, the 

classification followed the definitions of Winter (2001). All the data were recorded on 

paper topographic maps and converted to digital format. Later, integration of the field 

data and the sheet geologic maps Baldim (SE.23-Z-C-III), Sete Lagoas (SE.23-Z-C-

II), Contagem (SE.23-Z-C-V), and Belo Horizonte (SE.23-Z-C-VI), scale 1:100,000, 

was performed. These maps were acquired from the CPRM database, available on: 

http://geobank.sa.cprm.gov.br/.  

Aerial photography interpretation (scale 1:40,000, dated 1977) and the SRTM 

image (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission), Sheet SE-23-Z-C, acquired from the 

EMBRAPA's website (EMBRAPA 2006) were evaluated to define the map view 

lithologic contacts (http://www.relevobr.cnpm.embrapa.br).  

The locations of karst features (caves and sinkholes) were acquired from the 

National Center for Research and Conservation of Cave's website [CECAV - Centro

http://www.icmbio.gov.br/cecav/downloads (CECAV 2009).  

 

3.1.2 Subsurface lithologic contact  

 In order to obtain information on subsurface about lithologic contacts and karst 

features, lithologic well profiles were analyzed and optical well logs were run.  

For lithologic well profiles, a series of 218 profiles located in the municipalities of 

Baldim, Caetanópolis, Capim Branco, Cordisburgo, Esmeralda, Fortuna de Minas, 

Funilândia, Inhaúma, Inimutaba, Lagoa Santa, Maravilhas, Matozinhos, Papagaio, 

Paraobepa, Pedro Leopoldo, Prudente de Morais, São José da Lapa, and Sete 

Lagoas were acquired from the SIAGAS database, at the website: 

http://siagasweb.cprm.gov.br/layout/. In addition, 52 public well profiles located in 

Sete Lagoas were analyzed, provided by Water Supply and Sewage Service 

database (SAAE) [SAAE -Serviço de Abastecimento de Água e Esgoto]. Out of the 

270 profiles that were analyzed, the best and the most reliable were chosen.  

Optical well analysis yielded 30 vertical image profiles collected with R-Cam 

1000 Camera (Laval Underground Surveys). In addition to the standard downhole 

view, this camera offered a 360 degrees side-view perspective, capable of capturing 

a comprehensive survey of water wells. The camera had a maximum depth of 300 

meters and was connected to a receiver with monitor that enabled real time imaging. 

Therefore, it was possible to register the depths of dissolution zones, fractures and 

lithologic contacts. The location of these optical well logs can be seen in the Fig. 3. 

 

3.2 Hydrogeological approaches 

 

3.2.1 Pumping tests 

To obtain information about hydrogeological parameters, long transient 

pumping tests and drawdown tests were run in the SAAE’s public supply wells (Fig. 

3). Nine long duration transient pumping tests (48 hours) were made to calculate 

well-scale transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity using the Thiem (1906) and Theis 

(1935) methods. These tests involved pumping a well at a constant rate and 

measuring the drawdown in water level in some observation wells. 

Twenty-seven time-drawdown or step-drawdown tests to estimate specific 

capacity were made, consisting of a measure of the productivity pumping in a well at 



Chapter 3: Materials and methods 

Doctoral Thesis 11 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

a constant rate and measuring the resulting drawdown in water level. In mathematical 

terms, the specific capacity is defined as the pumping rate in the well, divided by the 

observed decline in hydraulic head in the well, from a time-drawdown test. For the 

step-drawdown tests, every discharge value was divided by its respective drawdowns 

observed in each step and, then, the mean specific capacity was calculated.

3.2.2 Stable isotopes samples 

Groundwater samples were taken during August 2011 and November 2012 in 

30 SAAE's public supply wells (25 samples from Sete Lagoas karst aquifer and 5 

samples from the basement) (Fig. 4). The wells located in the central area are 

pumping waters from the conduits in the karst aquifer. These samples were taken 

after removing several well volumes of water, using pumps installed in these wells. 

This was done to purge the aquifer of stagnant water and to acquire fresh aquifer 

samples for analysis. After sampling, physicochemical parameters (pH, temperature - 

T, electrical conductivity - EC, and oxidation-reduction potential - ORP) using the HI 

9828 portable multiparameter meter were measured.  

The surface water samples were collected in June 2013 in seven lakes: Brejão, 

Grande, José Felix, Paulino, Pedras, Piranhas, and Fazenda da Morada (Fig. 4). For 

this, samples were taken in the center of each lake using a peristaltic pump (brand 

Geopump). This method followed the low flow principle, avoiding sediment from the 

lake's substrate (Puls and Barcelona 1996). 

Eleven cumulative monthly rain isotope samples were also collected 

representing a hydrological year, from April 2012 to April 2013 (no samples in July 

2012 due to lack of rain). For this, a polypropylene bottle (10 L) with an also 

polypropylene funnel connected in that bottle were used and placed in a cooler to 

keep the temperature and prevent sunlight penetration. A silicone hose with 6 m long 

was also attached on the bottle to balance the pressure and prevent exchanges with 

atmospheric air. This method followed the GNIP (Global Network of Isotopes in 

Precipitation) instruction, where evaporation and loss of lighter isotopes are negligible 

(IAEA/WMO 2004).  

The main concern with these samples was to avoid the post-sampling 

fractionation. For this, pre-cleaned polypropylene vials (30 ml) were used. These 

vials were completely filled with samples, avoiding air bubbles inside and stored in 

coolers maintaining the temperature. All samples were analyzed for

Groundwater Research Center (CEPAS) [CEPAS - Centro de Pesquisas de Águas 

Subterrâneas], Institute of Geosciences, University of São Paulo. The samples were 

run on PICARRO L2130i, processed by Laboratory Information Management System 

(LIMS) for Lasers software, and were normalized to internal laboratory water 

standards that were previously calibrated relative to the Vienna Standard Mean 

Ocean Water (VSMOW). The results were expressed as ?

precisions were ±0.09‰ for ?

After all of these analyzes, the samples were compared with the latest Global 

Meteoric Water Line (GMWL) reported by Rozansky (1993), available at IAEA 

website: http://isohis.iaea.org. This meteoric water line is linearly related by the 

equation ?

O + 11.27, and it is an enhancement to the first meteoric water 

line proposed by Craig (1961), related by the equation ?

correlation coefficient reflects the fact that the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes 

in water molecules are intimately associated. 

 

3.2.3 Geochemistry analysis 

The same supply wells used to collect groundwater samples for isotopic 

analysis were also used for geochemistry evaluation (Fig. 4). Samples for major 

cations (Na

), major anions (HCO

dissolved solids (TDS), and total water hardness (WH) were collected in pre-cleaned 

1 L plastic polyethylene bottles, and then stored in coolers at 4°C, according to the 

Sampling and Water Samples Preservation Guide (CETESB 1998). For some 

analyzes, samples were filtered through a 0.45 ?m filter, while for major cations were 

acidified with nitric acid to a pH of less than 2. All these samples were analyzed at 

the Analytical Solution Company's laboratory, in São Paulo. 

 

3.3 Georeferencing data and software 

 

All the information was entered in a GIS database and georeferenced in ArcGIS 

10.1 software. The coordinate system was the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) 

projection, Zone 23, datum SAD 69, with units in meters.  

A four-step process was used to convert all the maps data to digital form: (1) 

automation: a scanned image of the original field map was vectorized, edited, and 

processed into arc, polygon, and point formats; (2) projection: digital files were 

transformed from digitizer coordinates to real-world coordinates and converted to a 

cartographic projection; (3) tables: tables were created to hold label information for 

polygons, arcs, and points; and (4) symbology: symbols were added for each 

different layers to indicate different information on the map plots. 



Chapter 3: Materials and methods 

Doctoral Thesis 14 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

To address areas with low data, and to help understand the spatial distribution 

of subsurface lithological contacts, as well as to understand the spatial concentration 

of some parameters, such as major ions or potentiometric surface, kriging 

interpolations of the data were carried out in Surfer 8 software, drawing isopleths 

maps. After that, these maps were visually improved in CorelDraw X3 software. 

For geochemical samples, all the measurements were checked for accuracy by 

calculating the mass balance, and then the water types were classified using the 

Piper's diagram of water (Piper 1944) at the AquaChem 4.0 software. For saturation 

index of calcite and dolomite calculations, PHREEQCI software was used.

Chapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts 

 

Doctoral Thesis 16 Galvão, P.H.F. 

 

CHAPTER 4: KARST HYDROGEOLOGY: ORIGINS AND CONCEPTS 

 

The term "karst", meaning stony ground, originates in the Dinaric Plateau in the 

Balkans region of Eastern Europe. This is also where the field of karst science began 

(Van Beynen 2011). Jovan Cviji? (1865-1927) helped lay down the foundation for the 

modern understanding of geomorphic processes in the late nineteenth century, 

where the karst science has expanded to include other types of karst, such as relict, 

paleokarst, fluviokarst, thermokarst, etc. (Ford and Williams 2007). Now in the 

twenty-first century, the science of karst has greatly advanced, incorporating an 

improved understanding of karst environments, their fragility, and their value to 

human development. 

Rocks types potentially containing karst cover about 20% of the Earth’s land 

surface, especially those developed in carbonate rocks, such as limestone, dolomite, 

or gypsum (Fig. 5), where 20-25% of the global population depends largely, or 

entirely, on groundwater obtained from them (Ford and Williams 2007). In Brazil, it is 

estimated that between 5 - 7% of the total surface of the country is composed by 

karst rocks (Karmann 1994), with the most extensive karst regions occurring in 

central Brazil, developed on Proterozoic and Lower Cambriam limestones and 

dolomites (Auler and Farrant 1996). Karst aquifers are extremely heterogeneous with 

a distribution of permeability that spans many orders of magnitude. They often 

contain open conduit flowpaths with hydraulic characteristics more like surface 

streams than groundwater (White 2003).  

These resources are coming under increasing pressure and have great need of 

rehabilitation and sustainable management, so the knowledge of their properties is 

increasingly important. The sections that follow will provide brief comments about the 

most relevant concepts related to karst hydrogeological systems that were useful to 

the development of this research and that may be useful for who will read this thesis 

as a reference for future works.

pure carbonates and the grey areas are impure carbonates (from Ford and Williams 2007). 
The resulting karst terrain tends to have high numbers of caves and sinkholes. 

 

4.1 The origin of karst 

 

Karst is commonly considered as the result of the solution process of carbonate 

rocks, named “karstification”. It occurs by chemical and, sometimes, mechanical 

action of water in a region generally of limestone, dolomite, or gypsum bedrock 

(Karamouz et al. 2011). The chemical composition of groundwater from these 

bedrocks is usually dominated by products from dissolution of carbonate minerals 

including calcite, aragonite and dolomite. The carbonate solution occurs because the 

water is acidic when it contains dissolved CO2, according to the following 

stoichiometric equations (Goldscheider and Drew 2007): 

 

CO2 + H2O ? H2CO3          (1) 

H2CO3 ? HCO
?

3 + H

2?

-

The solubility product corresponding to reaction 3 is quite small. However, 

because the carbonate ion is “removed” by protonation (equation 4), dissolution of 

carbonate minerals can proceed to a significant extent, depending on the quantity of

carbonic acid that is available and delivers protons (equation 2). Equations 1 - 4 can 

be summarized by equation 5: 

 

2H2O + CaCO3 + CO2 ? H2O + Ca
2+

 + 2HCO
-
3      (5) 

 

Because the concentration of dissolved CO2 is driven by both the temperature 

and the CO2 partial pressure of the atmosphere related to (ground) water, climate is 

generally considered as driving karst processes (Smith and Atkinson 1976, 

Bakalowicz 1992). Presently, and for late geologic time, CO2 was only abundant in 

the subsurface where it was produced either in soils by biological activity, or at depth 

by geological processes. Consequently, karst develops mainly with groundwater 

solution of the carbonate rocks. 

In fact, the solution of carbonate rocks proceeds only if groundwater flows, 

which export the products of dissolution creating underground voids. These voids 

progressively organize into a hierarchical structure (the conduit system or karst 

network) in the vadose and the phreatic zone. In it, pipe flow conditions prevail, either 

under pressure or at atmospheric pressure. Therefore, groundwater flow determines 

the hydrogeological structure of karst media, which in return creates an important 

feedback effect modifying the flow conditions (White 2003). The orientation and 

extension of the flow system and conduit network may change with time, where 

conduits may collapse, or be filled with sediments, or saturated conduits may 

transform into unsaturated conduits, or vice-versa (Goldscheider and Drew 2007). 

For this, karst develops only if the following conditions occur: (1) the possibility 

of dissolving carbonate rock, i.e. the existence of a solvent; and (2) a groundwater 

flow, determined by a hydraulic gradient and geological discontinuities, such as joints 

and bedding planes, folds, or faults/fractures. These conditions result in aquifers in 

which there may be unexpected groundwater flow paths and drainage outlet points, 

which cannot be predicted on the basis of the present topographic and hydrologic 

setting (White 2003, Goldscheider and Drew 2007). 

 

4.2 Features and controls on the development of karst system 

 

A karst region is usually formed by a set of phenomena, grouped into systems 

that are formed because of the existence of smaller structures dominated by tectonic, 



Chapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts 

 

Doctoral Thesis 19 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

stratigraphic, and lithologic factors. These elements are divided into three groups: (1) 

the epigenetic forms of absorption, where the infiltration of water in karst carves the 

karst morphology; (2) the hypogenic forms, where the water circulates through 

underground caves and other underground conduits; and (3) where the hypogenic 

circulation returns to normal epigenetic way through surges. All karst system, in local 

or regional scale, could have these three types of karst forms characterizing the 

"hydrogeological model", with recharge, water circulation (and its heterogeneities) 

and discharge area (White 2003).  

Király (2002) pointed out that groundwater flow depends on hydraulic 

parameters and on boundary conditions and, consequently, that other factor, such as 

geology, geomorphology, and climate, exert their influence on groundwater 

movement solely through hydraulic parameter fields and boundary conditions. These 

essential components inside of a karst aquifer flow system will be discussed as 

following. 

 

4.2.1 Recharge of karst aquifer (input control) 

A karst aquifer can be envisaged as an open system with a boundary defined 

by the catchment limits and with input, throughput and output flows, mechanisms and 

controls (Ford and Williams 2007). In the simplest case, there are different categories 

for karst aquifer recharge. If the karst area recharges itself, it is called autogenic 

recharge. Allogenic recharge occurs when the adjacent non-karst areas recharge the 

karst aquifer (Goldscheider and Drew 2007).  

Whereas autogenic recharge is often quite diffuse, down many fissures across 

the karst outcrop, allogenic recharge normally occurs as concentrated point-inputs of 

sinking streams. Both the water chemistry and the recharge volume per unit area are 

different in these two styles of recharge, with considerable consequences for the 

scale and distribution of the development of secondary permeability (Ford and 

Williams 2007). 

 

4.2.2 Hydraulic parameters (throughput control) 

4.2.2.1 Permeability of karst aquifer  

Formation bulk permeability depends on the shape, amount, distribution and 

interconnectivity of void spaces, or permeability structure. The "karstification" of an 

aquifer is in large part measured by its permeability distribution. For many years, this 



Chapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts 

 

Doctoral Thesis 20 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

has been discussed in terms of the "triple permeability" model (White 2003), 

consisting of: (1) matrix permeability of the bedrock itself (or primary porosity); (2) 

fracture permeability (or secondary porosity); and (3) conduit permeability (or tertiary 

porosity).  

The matrix permeability of many Paleozoic limestones and dolomites is very low 

and can often be ignored. Mezosoic limestones, such as those of Florida and the 

Caribbean islands may have very high matrix permeabilities. Fracture permeability 

requires two parameters: the fracture aperture and the fracture spacing. Both are 

statistical and have a range of values within the same aquifer. Fracture permeability 

is modified by solution so that fracture apertures range from tens or hundreds of 

micrometers in unmodified limestone up to 10 millimeters. The latter is the aperture at 

which non-linear effects begin to appear in the flow field and marks a useful 

boundary between large fractures and very small conduits. Conduits can range in 

size from 10 mm to tens (sometimes hundreds) of meters. Hydrologically, they 

behave much as storm drains. In map view, conduits take on many different patterns 

depending on local geology and various characteristics of the flow field itself. To 

understand the dynamics of a karst aquifer, then, it is necessary to understand the 

rate of recharge into the various components of the permeability and the exchange of 

water between these components (White 2003, Ford and Williams 2007).  

Because of this triple permeability, karst limestones can lead to well-known 

permeability scale effects, which are generally defined as continual increases in 

permeability magnitude from small- to regional-scale estimates, which is probably 

caused by fractures on the small-scale, and that the largest permeabilities on the 

regional-scale were caused by karstic conduits (Ratz 1967, Király 1975, Maclay and 

Land 1988, Halihan et al. 1999). According to Halihan et al. (2000), this increment in 

permeability can reach nine orders of magnitude variability. 

 

4.2.2.2 Transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity 

In practical terms, the transmissivity equals the horizontal groundwater flow rate 

through a vertical strip of aquifer one unit wide. Transmissivity is directly proportional 

to aquifer thickness and hydraulic conductivity. However, the concept of 

transmissivity in karst aquifers is not straight-forward: it is obvious that the 

transmissive properties of conduits and channels, where the groundwater 

preferentially flows, are much higher than in the surrounding aquifer matrix. At the

same time, the hydraulic conductivity has no real physical meaning in the case of 

conduit and channel flow; it is proportionality constant in Darcy’s law, which was 

derived for intergranular porous media, and has the dimension of velocity. Although 

the hydraulic conductivity has been used to calculate flow in all aquifer types, it 

should be noted that in karst aquifers it represents a lumped parameter, which 

describes properties of an “equivalent porous media”. In other words, the hydraulic 

response of all porosity types, including conduits and karst channels, is described 

with one parameter: an equivalent hydraulic conductivity (Goldscheider and Drew 

2007). 

 

4.2.2.3 Groundwater velocity 

Because of widely varying hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity of karst 

carbonates, even within the same aquifer system, the groundwater velocity in karst 

can vary over many orders of magnitude. One should therefore be very careful when 

making a (surprisingly common) statement such as “groundwater velocity in karst is 

generally very high” (Goldscheider and Drew 2007). Although this may be true for 

turbulent flow taking place in karst conduits, a disproportionably larger volume of any 

karst aquifer “experiences” relatively low groundwater velocities (laminar flow) 

through small fissures and rock matrix.  

It is interesting that, based on 281 dye tracing tests, the most frequent velocity 

(14% of all cases) in the classic Dinaric karst of Herzegovina, as reported by 

Milanovic (1979), is quite similar: between 864 and 1728 m/d. 25% of the results 

show groundwater velocity greater than 2655 m/d in West Virginia, and greater than 

5184 m/d in Herzegovina.  

Confined karst aquifers, which do not have major concentrated discharge points 

in forms of large springs, generally have much lower groundwater flow velocities. 

This is regardless of the predominant porosity type because the whole system is 

under pressure and the actual displacement of “old” aquifer water with the newly 

recharged one is rather slow. Groundwater flow velocity estimates using carbon 

fourteen isotope dating for the confined portion of the Floridan aquifer in central 

Florida (Hanshaw and Back 1974) showed that the average groundwater velocity 

based on 40 values is 6.9 m/y or 0.019 m/d.

4.2.2.4 Groundwater flow 

Flow through fractures 

Fracture aperture and thickness are two parameters used most often in various 

single-fracture flow equations, while spacing between the fractures and fracture 

orientation is used when calculating flow through a set of fractures. However, these 

actual physical characteristics are not easily and meaningfully translated into 

equations attempting to describe flow at a realistic field scale (Goldscheider and 

Drew 2007): 

1) Fracture aperture is not constant and there are voids and very narrow or 

contact areas called asperities. Various experimental studies have shown that the 

actual flow in a fracture is channeled through narrow, conduit-like tortuous paths and 

cannot be simply represented by the flow between two parallel plates separated by 

the “mean” aperture (Cacas 1989); 

2) Because of stress release, the aperture measure at outcrops or in accessible 

cave passages is not the same as an in-situ aperture. Aperture measured on drill 

cores and in borings is also not a true one – the drilling process commonly causes 

bedrock adjacent to fractures to break out thereby increasing the apparent widths of 

fracture openings as viewed on borehole-wall images (Williams et al. 2001); 

3) Fractures have limited length and width, which can also vary between 

individual fractures in the same fracture set. Spacing between individual fractures in 

the same set can also vary. Since all these variations take place in the three-

dimensional space, they cannot be directly observed, except through continuous 

coring or logging of multiple closely spaced boreholes, which is the main cost-limiting 

factor (Williams et al. 2001). 

 

Flow through conduits and channels 

Flow through conduits is generally described by the well-known Bernoulli 

equation for real viscous fluids. The total energy surface (E) of flow can only 

decrease from the upgradient cross section towards the downgradient cross section 

of the same flow tube (conduit) due to energy losses. On the other hand, the 

piezometric surface (H) can go “up” and “down” along the same flow tube depending 

on the cross sectional area. The total energy surface, which includes the flow velocity 

component (?v
2
/2g), can be directly measured only by the Pitot device whose 

installation is not feasible in most field conditions (Goldscheider and Drew 2007). 



Chapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts 

 

Doctoral Thesis 23 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

Monitoring wells and piezometers, on the other hand, only record the 

piezometric pressure (hydraulic head), which does not include the flow velocity 

component. It is therefore conceivable that two piezometers in or near the same karst 

conduit with rapid flow may not provide useful information for calculation of the real 

flow velocity and flow rate between them, and may even falsely indicate the opposite 

flow direction. There are additional complicating factors when attempting to calculate 

flow through natural karst conduits using the pipe approach: (1) flow through the 

same conduit may be both under the pressure and with the free surface; (2) since 

conduit walls are more or less irregular (“rough”), the related coefficient of roughness 

has to be estimated and inserted into the general flow equation; (3) conduit cross 

section may vary significantly over short distances; and (4) the flow may be both 

laminar and turbulent in the same conduit, depending on the flow velocity, cross-

sectional area and wall roughness. The irregularities that cause turbulent flow are 

mathematically described through the Reynolds number and the friction factor. 

 

4.2.3 Discharge of karst aquifer (output control) 

Most of the largest springs in the world are karst springs (Ford and Williams 

2007). They represent the termination of underground river systems and mark the 

point at which surface fluvial processes become dominant. The vertical position of the 

spring controls the elevation of the water table at the output of the aquifer, whereas 

the hydraulic conductivity and throughput discharge determine the slope of the water 

table upstream and its variation under different discharge conditions. 

A distinguishing feature of karst aquifers is that most of the groundwater is 

discharged through a small number of large springs. In some aquifers, the entire 

discharge is through a single spring. In other, there is a distributary system to a small 

number of springs. One or a few of these carry the base-flow discharge and are 

called "underflow springs", while other springs flow only during periods of high 

discharge and are called "overflow springs" (Worthington 1991). The discharge from 

karst springs is a composite of all water moving through the aquifer. The spring (or 

springs), therefore, is an optimum location for measuring hydrographs, chemographs, 

and for monitoring the aquifer for contaminants.

4.3 Karst landform 

 

Karst landscapes form in areas with carbonate bedrock subjected to slow 

dissolution processes (Fleury 2009). These processes typically result in the formation 

of visible surface and subsurface features, including sinkholes, caves, and springs, 

where the water is the main agent of landscape altercation (Palmer 2007). 

Subsequently, the basic understanding of the most common karst landforms will be 

discussed. 

 

4.3.1 Sinkholes (Dolines) 

Sinkholes, or dolines, are an extremely common type of karst landform, created 

by the subsidence of soils and rock at or near the land surface into empty space 

below (Fleury 2009). They are often located in areas where soluble rock is near the 

surface, either completely exposed or beneath a layer of topsoil. Sinkhole 

development can be triggered by any mechanism that increases the head differential 

between the artesian water in the limestone and the perched water in the surface soil 

(Beck 1986), resulting in depressions with a shape of bowls or funnels. 

In order to form a sinkhole, three requirements are needed (Fleury 2009): (1) a 

drainage path for the surface water runoff to follow; (2) a zone of bedrock modified by 

solution located at or near the surface; and (3) a covering of soil or some other 

material making up the land surface.  

With some exceptions, sinkholes are generally not large landforms. However, 

they are important to understand in the context of karst systems because they act as 

recharge routes for the aquifer below. The fact that surface water receives no natural 

filtering when entering a karst aquifer via sinkhole means that contaminants on the 

surface are easily carried into the groundwater (White 1988). 

 

4.3.2 Caves 

Caves are generally a natural opening in the earth that is large enough to be 

entered by a human (White 1988, Palmer 2007). Usually, cave systems are the result 

of a succession of active conduit networks that evolve through time (Klimchouk et al. 

2000). It has been demonstrated that phreatic conduit systems may develop within a 

few thousand years if recharge is sufficient (Palmer 2000), especially if initial 

openings are wide enough (&gt;0.1 mm). In many mountainous karst areas, those 



Chapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts 

 

Doctoral Thesis 25 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

conditions are fulfilled, and active conduits normally are located close to the valley 

bottoms. In mountain ranges, it can be assumed that uplift is more or less 

compensated for by the entrenchment of valleys, therefore new conduits have to form 

each time the valley floor is entrenched further, previous (higher-level) conduits 

become only temporarily active, and later are eventually permanently abandoned by 

the water. Most of the caves explored by cavers are part of those dry (fossil) 

systems. This simple model may be more complex if, for any reason, the base level 

was raised at any time in the past (Audra et al. 2004). 

 

4.3.3 Springs 

Springs are formed at the spots where karst waters emerge from the local 

underground drainage system. They can be found on the surface or in caves and are 

often used as sources of drinking water and as recreation areas (Fleury 2009). Their 

formation is a direct result of carbonate rock dissolution, creating large conduits and 

caves that can then channel groundwater up to the land surface. Springs can serve 

as hydrogeological trend indicators and are very stable in terms of water quality, 

temperature and flow, though even short-term variation in rainfall can be reflected by 

a spring's flow (Field 2002).  

 

4.3.4 Poljes 

Poljes - the largest karst hollows - are wide, closed depressions with flat floors, 

which are often adjacent to steep enclosing walls. They require extremely thick and 

geographically extensive carbonate bedrock to form at all. Poljes have their own 

internal drainage systems and often have complex hydrogeological characteristics, 

including shallows holes and disappearing streams (Field 2002). 

 

4.3.5 Karst valleys 

Karst valleys form when a developing underground drainage system diverts 

water away from the rivers feeding into the valley. They have all the properties of a 

stream valley except the stream itself, being more common in areas of flat, 

interbedded layers of limestone, sandstone and shale (White 1988). 

 



Chapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts 

 

Doctoral Thesis 26 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

4.3.6 Sinking streams 

They are surface features that direct runoff into an underground channel, in 

other words, they are sinkholes that form in a stream bed, often with a large vertical 

shaft beneath (Ford and Williams 2007).  

 

4.4 Human impacts on karst system  

 

Karst environments are particularly fragile and vulnerable to damage compared 

with most other natural systems. The reason for this is the nature of the karst 

hydrological system. Efficient drainage of the surface down numerous widened joints, 

dolines, and sinkholes rapidly transmits surface pollution underground and readily 

evacuates soils stripped from the surface. Filtration of diffuse recharge is minimal 

because limestone soils are usually thin, while transmission of recharge is essentially 

unfiltered because subterranean conduits have large dimensions and rapid 

transmission provides minimal opportunity for die-off of pathogenic organisms (Ford 

and Williams 2007).  

Thus, it is a fact that karst areas are highly vulnerable to overuse and misuse, 

having major subterranean components that require specialist knowledge to manage 

properly and, once damaged, can be extremely difficult to protect and restore. 

Because of this vulnerability, karst areas can be impacted in form of deforestation, 

agricultural activity, or rocky desertification, as well as subsidences induced by 

dewatering, constructions, or groundwater contaminations. Here, emphasis will be 

given to induced sinkholes and groundwater contamination, considering these 

impacts are more common in the study area of this thesis. 

 

4.4.1 Groundwater contamination in karst aquifer 

Karst aquifers are particularly vulnerable to contamination: due to thin soils, flow 

concentration in the epikarst (the uppermost, often intensively fractured and karstified 

layer of a carbonate aquifer), and point recharge via swallow holes, contaminants can 

easily reach the groundwater, where they may be transported rapidly in karst 

conduits over large distances. The residence times of contaminants are often short 

and processes of contaminant attenuation, therefore, often do not work effectively in 

karst systems. Karst aquifers, consequently, need special protection. However, 

protection zoning for karst is more complicated than for granular aquifers, because 



Chapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts 

 

Doctoral Thesis 27 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

karst systems are highly heterogeneous and anisotropic, the catchments may cover 

large areas and flow velocities may be as high as 500 m/h (Goldscheider and Drew 

2007). 

Many serious problems of human impacts on waters emphatically do exist, even 

if they are not obvious to the casual observer. Water contamination may be 

transmitted into karst by both allogenic and autogenic sources. In the autogenic 

context, contamination can arise from both dispersed and point sources. Dispersed-

source contamination enters the epikarst before being transmitted to the phreatic 

zone, whereas point-source contamination normally bypass the epikarst, typically 

down doline drains, and is rapidly transmitted to the water table (Ford and Williams 

2007). 

Some cities built in carbonate rocks, especially in developing countries, have 

limited or no sewer systems. Consequently, considerable municipal and industrial 

waste has been and, in many cases, still is being discharged into karst without 

treatment, giving rise to many water quality problems. As a result, the presence of 

high nitrate concentrations are present in urban areas (indication of an inefficient 

management of domestic sanitation systems) in groundwater (Foster and Hirata 

1987), exceeding all federal and state drinking water quality requirements. In 

agricultural areas, the most common is the contamination of pesticide and fertilizers, 

while in industrial zones, high concentrations of DNAPL (dense, non-aqueous phase 

liquids), LNAPL (light, non-aqueous phase liquids), and metals (chromium, nickel, 

cadmium and mercury) are more common (Ford and Williams 2007). All those 

elements can result in poor drinking water quality, loss of water supply, degraded 

surface water systems, high cleanup costs, high costs for alternative water supplies 

(specially in karst aquifers because of its inherent heterogeneities), and/or potential 

health problems. 

  

4.4.2 Induced subsidences 

After groundwater pollution, induced subsidences, a geotechnical problem, such 

as sinkholes and collapses, are the most prominent hazardous effect of human 

activity in karst regions. Agriculture, mining and quarrying, highways and railways, 

urban and industrial constructions all contribute. In 99% of reported cases or more 

events occur in an overburden of unconsolidated cover sands, silts or clays (Ford 

and Williams 2007). 



Chapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts 

 

Doctoral Thesis 28 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

These events can occur naturally (by dissolution of rock, or through the failure 

of a bedrock roof overlying a cave), or can be induced or accelerated by human 

activities, which are commonly characterized by catastrophic collapse (Newton 1976, 

LaMoreaux and Newton 1986, LaMoreaux 1997). The formation of both of these 

types of geotechnical issues generally occur over periods of geologic time, not within 

a human lifetime in carbonate formations. Therefore, it is important to emphasize that 

the differences between both natural and anthropogenic situations is the speed at 

which the collapse processes begin, which is accelerated in an anthropogenic 

situation (Albrecht 1996). 

The induced geotechnical problems in these settings commonly form because 

of groundwater withdrawal, construction activities, or a combination of both (Newton 

1987, Bell 1997). In the case of groundwater withdrawal in an urban aquifer, periods 

of drought are the most dangerous, corresponding increased demand for 

groundwater, leading to the formation of enlarged cones of depression (Oliveira 

1997). Within these cones of depression, wells, springs, and streams can go dry or 

have their flows significantly reduced with the overall direction of groundwater flow 

being changed inducing geotechnical problems (Hobbs and Gunn 1998).  

 

4.5 Isotopes and significance to karst hydrology 

 

Karst groundwaters can be characterized by natural or anthropogenic tracers 

including isotopes, hydrochemical constituents, and artificial tracers, such as 

fluorescent dyes (Goldscheider and Drew 2007). Isotopic data elucidate the origin 

and age of karst waters and the rocks that enclose them, and show that mixing and 

carbonate reactivity are major variables. Hydrogen, carbon and oxygen are the 

dominant constituents in karst waters, karst bedrock, speleothems, travertine 

deposits, and in dissolved bicarbonate, which is normally the dominant anion in karst 

water. Fortunately, these elements all include stable isotopes that exhibit variations 

large enough to be routinely measured with mass spectrometers. In the case of this 

thesis, the stable isotopes hydrogen and oxygen were used for tracking the origin of 

water and its subsequent movement.  

Physically, the stable isotopes are atoms that take the same position in the 

table of elements, but have a different number of neutrons and, therefore, mass. The 

most relevant isotopes for atmospheric and hydrologic sciences are 
18

O for oxygen 



Chapter 4: Karst hydrogeology: origins and concepts 

 

Doctoral Thesis 29 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

(corresponding to the most abundant isotope 
16

O), and 
2
H (or Deuterium, D) for 

hydrogen (corresponding to the most abundant isotope 
1
H) (Gat 1996, Mook 2001).  

These isotopes, during evaporation and condensation phases, become 

enriched in one phase and depleted in the other. This separation of isotopes is 

named isotopic fractionation (Mook 2001), and quantifying these processes is 

possible by calculating the large variability of their isotopic ratios (
2
H/H and 

18
O/

16
O).  

Measurements of stable isotopes also require a common standard. For 

atmospheric applications, the usual standard is the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean 

Water (V-SMOW), published and distributed regularly by the International Atomic 

Energy Agency (IAEA). The delta (?) notation is used to quantify stable isotope as 

relative ratios and the isotopes values are reported in per mil (‰) to make it easy to 

compare significant results. 

Different results from the standard V-SMOW provide information about recharge 

and discharge processes; flow, mixing and interconnections between aquifers; 

evaporation; marine influence; and the sources and mechanism of pollution (Clark 

and Fritz 1997).  

Craig (1961) observed that the ?
 18

O and ?
 2

H values of precipitation that have 

not been evaporated are linearly related by the equation ?
2
H = 8 ?

18
O + 10. This 

equation, known as the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL), is based on 

precipitation data from locations around the globe, and has an r
2
 &gt; 0.95. This high 

correlation coefficient reflects the fact that the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes 

in water molecules are intimately associated. The slope and intercept of any Local 

Meteoric Water Line (LMWL), which is the line derived from precipitation collected 

from a single site or set of "local" sites, can be significantly different from the GMWL. 

 A GMWL reported by Rozansky (1993) related by the equation ?
2
H = 8.17?

18
O 

+ 11.27 is an enhancement to the meteoric water line proposed by Craig (1961) 

having much more data included, which can provide more accuracy in the meteoric 

water line.

Abstract 

 

The study area is located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, among the municipalities of Pedro 

Leopoldo, Matozinhos, and Sete Lagoas, with Velhas River as the eastern boundary. It is located in 

the São Francisco Craton, where carbonated argillo-arenaceous sediments are emplaced giving origin 

to the Bambuí Group, in the São Francisco Basin. Despite the geological knowledge previously 

developed, the region needs work on integration and detailing of such information. For this reason, the 

main objective was to contribute to the quality of the geologic cartography, the spatial distribution, and 

the structural framework geometry. Thus, geologic mapping, aerial photography interpretation, and 

evaluation of 270 lithologic well profiles were carried out. It was possible to establish a new geologic 

perspective of the region by obtaining the detailed geologic map of the municipality of Sete Lagoas, 14 

geologic cross sections, and a geologic conceptual model. The study showed that the area is within a 

basin border, presenting a geometry conditioned by horst and graben system controlled by faulting. 

This structural feature displaced stratigraphic sequences positioning them side by side with lithologic 

sequences with different ages.

1. Introduction 

  

The study area is located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, among the municipalities of Pedro 

Leopoldo, Matozinhos, and Sete Lagoas, with Velhas River as the eastern boundary (Fig. 1). 

Geologically, this area is located in the São Francisco Craton, where carbonated argillo-arenaceous 

sediments are emplaced giving origin to the Bambuí Group, deposited in an epicontinental shelf in the 

São Francisco Basin. The geologic particularities provide important economic resources to the region, 

which have driven the economic development and population increase with the municipality of Sete 

Lagoas at the forefront. There is a considerable industrial, mineral, and metallurgical center in this 

region situated mainly along the main federal highway, which is a corridor of significant growth.  

The previous studies about the Bambuí Group were carried out by Branco and Costa (1961), 

who proposed the first stratigraphic column of the region, later modified by Oliveira (1967), Schöll

(1973), Dardenne (1978) and, finally, by Ribeiro et al. (2003). In addition, other important studies 

related to structural (Magalhães 1989), geochronological (Babinski and Kaufman 2003), 

hydrogeological (Pessoa 1996, 2005), and geological evolution (Nobre-Lopes 1995, Uhlein et al. 

2004, Tuller et al. 2009) were carried out. Despite the geologic knowledge being well developed, the 

area needs work on integration and detailing of the geologic information. Thus, the primary goal of this 

paper was to contribute to the quality of the geologic cartography, as well as the spatial arrangement, 

and the structural framework of the lithologies found in this region. Aerial photography, geologic 

mapping, and the evaluation of 270 lithological well profiles located in Sete Lagoas and in the adjacent 

municipalities were integrated with the available data to provide a new geologic perspective of the 

region. As a result, the update to the geologic map of the municipality of Sete Lagoas, 14 geologic 

cross sections, and a geologic conceptual model were created.  

 

2. Site description 

 

The study area (Fig. 1) overlies the São Francisco Craton (Almeida 1977), which is represented 

by crystalline rocks from the Paleoproterozoic age formed by the agglutination of different craton 

blocks from the Archean age. Extension events occurred between 900 and 600 Ma. (Condie 2002) 

allowing Neoproterozoic silicate-carbonate sediments from the Bambuí Group to be deposited.  

Regionally, the Bambuí Group is about 300,000 km
2
 (Almeida 1977), including mainly the states 

of Minas Gerais, Goiás, and Bahia. The basement being controlled by a faulting system causing the 

thickness of the sediments to be variable (Misi et al. 2007). According to seismic surveys conducted 

by Petrobras S.A., the central area of this group can have a thickness of 1,000 m, while in the 

municipality of Sete Lagoas it is estimated to 600 m thick on average (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 1994).  

The sediments of the Bambuí Group were deposited in a low gradient stable epicontinental 

shelf in shallow water conditions, which explains a regional occurrence of the lithofacies. 

(Schobbenhaus 1984). Stratigraphically, there were three regressive sedimentary mega-cycles: (1) 

carbonated (Sete Lagoas Formation); (2) argillo-carbonated (Serra de Santa Helena and Lagoa do 

Jacaré formations); and (3) argillo-arenaceous (Serra da Saudade and Três Marias formations).  

The Bambuí Group is represented by the following formations, from the base to the top: 

Carrancas (diamictites, sandstones, and rhythmites); Sete Lagoas (carbonate sequence); Serra de 

Santa Helena (siltstones, phyllites, slate, arkose, and marlstones), Lagoa do Jacaré (oolitic 

limestones); Serra da Saudade (siltstones, sands, and sandstones); and Três Marias (fluvial platform 

sandstones) (Tuller et al. 2009). 

The basement is represented by gneissic rocks associated with granitoids and migmatite zones 

from the Belo Horizonte Complex. Overlying the Bambuí Group, are the unconsolidated sediments 

from Cenozoic surface coverage (Tuller et al. 2009). The Bambuí Group is represented by the 

following formations, associated with mega-cycles 1 and 2 (Fig. 1):  

1) Sete Lagoas Formation (Dardenne 1978): overlies the Carrancas Formation in some areas, 

or may have direct contact with the basement. The ages range from 740±22 Ma. old, based on data 

from Pb-Pb analysis (Babinski et al. 2007), to 630 Ma., by C-O-Sr data (Caxito et al 2012), or 540 Ma., 

through paleontology investigations (Warren et al 2014). Three carbonate depositional systems are

recognized (Lima 1997): (1) internal ramp; (2) intermediary ramp; and (3) external ramp deposits; 

characterized by a shallowing upward cycle. This formation is divided and characterized by two 

members (Ribeiro et al. 2003): Pedro Leopoldo, at the base, composed of fine grained white 

limestones, dolomites, marlstones, and pelites; and Lagoa Santa, on the top, by medium grained black 

limestones;  

2) Serra de Santa Helena Formation (Costa and Branco 1961): having an area greater than 

7,000 km² and represented by three stratigraphic members (Grossi Sad et al. 1998): (1) lower, 

characterized by silt-clay rhythmites, generally carbonaceous, and dark shales (about 90 m thickness); 

(2) medium, composed of marble and shales (50 m thick); and (3) upper, consisting of shales, 

siltstones, slate cleavage, and cross bedding (around 140 m thick).  

Regarding the structural geology, the main planar structures are faults, foliations and fractures, 

consisting of two types of faults (Danderfer Filho 1991, Tuller et al. 2009): normal and thrust, trending 

NNW-SSE. Kinematic indicators, such as stretching and mineral lineations, indicate tectonic transport 

from east to west, forming interstratal ramp thrust belts, accommodated in more argillous upper 

planes. The first generation of the structures is composed of normal synsedimentary faults. Based on 

structural surveys, the Bambuí Group is divided into four structural domains, according to the 

magnitude of the deformation (Tuller et al. 2009): (1) high intensity of deformation domain, where 

rocks from the Espinhaço Supergroup outcrop. The presence of mass transport commonly indicates 

movement from east to west; (2) intermediate domain, characterized by less intense deformation, 

more deformed to the east and less deformed to the west; (3) domain where the Bambuí Group rocks 

are presented less deformed to not deformed; and (4) domain less deformed at the far west portion of 

the area, affecting mainly the rocks from the Serra da Saudade Formation.  

The study area is located only in the intermediate structural domain, extending from Velhas 

River to the far western border of the municipality of Sete Lagoas.  

 

3. Methods 

 

Three sets of data were integrated to evaluate the geologic setting of the region. These included 

geologic mapping, aerial photography interpretation, and lithologic well log analysis. These methods 

will be presented sequentially followed by the approach to data integration. 

Geologic mapping of the entire municipality of Sete Lagoas was carried out in a scale of 

1:25,000. The classification of the sedimentary rocks followed the definitions of Folk (1980) and the 

microscopic classification of the carbonate rocks followed the definitions of Folk (1959) and Dunham 

(1962). For the metamorphic and igneous rocks, the classification followed definitions of Winter 

(2001). All the data were recorded on paper topographic maps and converted to digital format. ArcGIS 

10.1 was used throughout the project to construct the digital map. Later, integration of the field data 

and the sheet geologic maps Baldim (SE.23-Z-C-III), Sete Lagoas (SE.23-Z-C-II), Contagem (SE.23-

Z-C-V), and Belo Horizonte (SE.23-Z-C-VI), scale 1:100,000, was performed. These maps were 

acquired from the CPRM database, available on: http://geobank.sa.cprm.gov.br/.

the study area limits and its respective average thicknesses (modified from Tuller et al. 2009). The 
municipality of Sete Lagoas is limited by the black continuous line. 
 

Aerial photography interpretation (scale 1:40,000, dated 1977) and the SRTM image (Shuttle 

Radar Topography Mission), Sheet SE-23-Z-C, acquired from the EMBRAPA's website were 

evaluated to define the lithologic contacts (http://www.relevobr.cnpm.embrapa.br).  

Information about lithologic well logs was taken from the SIAGAS database 

(http://siagasweb.cprm.gov.br). A serie of 218 lithologic well profiles were acquired, located in the 

municipalities of Baldim, Caetanópolis, Capim Branco, Cordisburgo, Esmeralda, Fortuna de Minas, 

Funilândia, Inhaúma, Inimutaba, Lagoa Santa, Maravilhas, Matozinhos, Papagaio, Paraobepa, Pedro 

Leopoldo, Prudente de Morais, São José da Lapa, and Sete Lagoas. In addition, 52 public well logs 

located in Sete Lagoas were analyzed, kindly provided by Water Supply and Sewage Service 

database (SAAE) [SAAE -Serviço de Abastecimento de Água e Esgoto]. Out of the 270 lithologic well 

profiles that were analyzed, the best and the most reliable were chosen.  

In order to help understand the areas where data were sparse, and thus estimate the geologic 

contact depth, kriging interpolations of the data were carried out in Surfer 8 software. 

The complete data sets were entered in a GIS database and georeferenced in ArcGIS 10.1 

software. The coordinate system was Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection, Zone 23, 

datum SAD 69, with units in meters.

Finally, 14 geologic cross sections were made (NW-SE and NE-SW), at a scale of 1:25,000, 

within the municipality of Sete Lagoas, and a scale of 1:100,000 in the surrounding areas. The 

topographic elevations were extracted from the SRTM image, using the Global Mapper 11 software. 

 

4. Results and discussions 

 

4.1. Geologic mapping 

 

The lithologies found were the basement rocks from the Belo Horizonte Complex, the carbonate 

sequence from the Sete Lagoas Formation, the fine grained clastic rocks from the Serra de Santa 

Helena Formation, and the unconsolidated sediments from the Cenozoic surface coverage. Rocks 

from the Carrancas Formation (diamictites, sandstones, and rhythmites), stratigraphically below the 

Sete Lagoas Formation, were not identified and mapped within the study area, but were mapped over 

the southeast and northwest of the area by Ribeiro et al. (2003) and Tuller et al. (2009). In the case of 

the Lagoa do Jacaré Formation, these oolitic limestone rocks, with a mean thickness of 25 m, can be 

found in the far northwest portion of the area and it is more detailed by Tuller et al. (2009). 

 

4.1.1. Belo Horizonte Complex 

This igneous/metamorphic basement complex occurs in the SW and SE regions of the area 

(Fig. 6). It is characterized by a set of gneissic rocks and migmatite zones, with polymetamorphic 

features, corresponding to the São Francisco Craton (Ribeiro et al. 2003). The contacts between the 

different lithotypes are transitional, between gneiss, migmatites and/or granitoids. Stretched minerals 

are common, with presence of concordant shearing zones, layers and/or lengthened veins, many 

times boudinaged. The granitoids are light gray to whitish, with medium to coarse grained, sometimes 

with sparse porphyroblasts of tabular feldspars, xenoliths, or restites from partial fusion. 

Petrographically, they vary in composition with hornblende gneisses, biotite gneisses, or amphibole 

gneisses, whose protolytes would be granites and tonalites, subjected to a metamorphism of the 

amphibole facies, with hydrothermal alteration (Tuller et al. 2009). This complex was intensely affected 

by basic injections, resulting in a group of basic rock dikes (Ribeiro et al. 2003). In the south portion of 

Sete Lagoas, epigenic and igneous metamorphic/migmatite rocks with plutonic feature are common 

(Fig. 2), as well as intrusions of mafic rocks, filling the fracture planes. Schistosity and transposition 

foliation are also observed.

(right, UTM: 570183/7843875). 

 

4.1.2. Sete Lagoas Formation 

This limestone occurs mainly in the SE region of the area. In the municipality of Sete Lagoas, it 

occurs in the central and western portions, and in the Santa Helena Ridge foothills (Fig. 6). The lower 

contact with the basement is abrupt, discordant, and tectonic, with faults. The upper contact with the 

Serra de Santa Helena Formation is also abrupt (Figs. 9 and 10).  

The Sete Lagoas Formation is divided by two members: Pedro Leopoldo, at the base, 

composed of fine grained white limestones, dolomites, marlstones and pelites; and Lagoa Santa, on 

the top, composed of medium grained black limestones. 

According to Vieira et al. (2007), there are six lithological facies, four in the Pedro Leopoldo 

Member and two in the Lagoa Santa Member: Facies 1, characterized by light gray to beige calcilutite, 

with intercalations of yellowish pelite and truncated wave-ripple stratification, and tidal plain 

sedimentation environment, with possible storm influence; Facies 2, with aragonite crystals, 

constituting tabular beds and/or layers of sea sedimentation in deep waters; Facies 3, constituted by 

dolomite rocks, which are disposed in overlaid benches with metric to sub-metric thickness; Facies 4, 

beige to light gray calcilutites, plane-parallel stratification, with rithmite terrigenous and carbonate 

sedimentation, suggesting calm to slightly agitated waters sedimentation; Facies 5, characterized by 

black calcarenites and calcisiltites, plane-parallel lamination, wave truncation, medium sized crossed 

stratifications; and Facies 6, represented by well preserved stromatolites, from a tidal flat environment.  

In relation to the lithological facies mentioned above, 3 of the 4 facies in the Pedro Leopoldo 

Member were confirmed:  

1) Facies 1: located in the Canaã quarry (near the Federal Road Police post, BR-040). It has a 

decametric thickness of approximately 40 meters, represented by micritic limestone with medium to 

dark gray recrystallized sparite grains. The occurrence of meter-scale recumbent bends is common, 

with recrystallization and intergrowth of calcite minerals parallel to the bedding, especially in joints; 

2) Facies 2: located in the Ilcon quarry (South-East of the municipality of Sete Lagoas). It is 

characterized by regular and homogeneous intercalation of micritic stratums, with thicknesses of 15 -

20 cm, and an intercalation of marlstone levels with brown-pink color, with terrigenous grain sizes. 

Occurrence of euhedral millimetric pyrite grains is also observed, with well developed cubic form;  

3) Facies 3: located in the Sambra, Paraíso, Capão do Meio quarries, and in the Capão do 

Inferno farm. Described as micritic rock, with occurrence of chlorite placoid minerals, and well-

developed bedding planes. The presence of pseudomorph aragonite arborescentes, with reddish 

color, recovered with cream colored micrite are observed.  

This Member presents important dissolution developed either in bedding planes (most frequent) 

and in sub-vertical fractures (less common), which are filled with terrigenous material (Fig. 3). 

 

Fig. 3. Subvertical fractures (left, UTM: 565445/7851910) and bedding plane dissolution, most 
frequently observed, filling with terrigenous sediments (right, UTM: 563101/7853620). 
 

In relation to the lithological facies seen in the Lagoa Santa Member: 

1) Facies 5: rock with variable character, between gray micro-sparites and calcarenites, plane-

parallel laminate;  

2) Facies 6: occurrence of stromatolite layers, type gyminosolens (Marchese 1974) (Fig. 4).  

This Member presents important dissolution resulting in caves and grottoes (Fig. 4). 

Microscopically, the limestones from Pedro Leopoldo Member are composed of 85% micrite, 

8% sparite, and 7% quartz, classified as micrite (Folk 1959) or mudstone (Dunham 1962). The 

limestones from Lagoa Santa Member are 55 % sparite, 30 % ooids, and 15 % micrite, classified as 

an oobiosparite (Folk 1959) or grainstone (Dunham 1962).

4.1.3. Serra de Santa Helena Formation 

This fine grained clastic formation occurs in the N, NE, NW regions (Fig. 6). It overlays the Sete 

Lagoas Formation with abrupt, tectonic, or occasionally, gradational contacts. The basement contacts 

are abrupt and discordant due to thrust faults apparent on the basin's border. The overlaying Lagoa do 

Jacaré and Serra da Saudade formations are characterized by transitional contacts and can be locally 

abrupt (Tuller et al. 2009) (Figs. 9 and 10). This formation presents schistosity type foliation, 

discordant and/or concordant with the bedding. This whole sequence is cut by abundant bended 

quartz-feldspar veins, usually filling fractures or relief zones, generated during extensional events 

(Tuller et al. 2009). 

In Sete Lagoas, it was possible to see intercalated levels of slate rocks with well-developed 

cleavage planes in thin layers, presenting gray-greenish sericite. Locally, less developed cubic grains 

of pyrite may occur. At the base, slate, siltstone, and argillite are found, very friable. Vertical fractures 

filled with quartz veins with well-developed hexagonal forms (Fig. 5) and, locally, pegmatite veins, rich 

in feldspar and calcitite grains were also observed. 

 

Fig. 4. Quartz veins in subvertical fracture systems in phyllites layers (top of the Santa Helena Ridge - 
left, UTM: 577708/7852972) and slate with a well-developed rock cleavage coincident to the bedding 
planes (right, UTM: 576695/7852000). 

 

4.1.4. Cenozoic Surface Coverage 

This unit (Fig. 6) is divided into (1) detritus coverage, (2) alluvial terraces, and (3) alluviums. The 

detritus coverage is composed by unconsolidated sediments with predominant red color, arenaceous-

argillous with levels of gravel, which occur indistinctly on all units, but mainly on the rocks from the 

Serra de Santa Helena Formation. The alluvial terraces occur along the larger streams and rivers in 

the area, such as the Velhas River and its effluents. They are up to 5 m thick and mainly consist of 

argillo-arenaceous semi-consolidated sediments, with whitish to yellowish and reddish color. Finally, 

the alluviums occur along the meanders of the big watercourses. They are composed of fine to coarse 

grained sediments, with discontinuous levels of quartz pebbles, in general rounded and not well 

sorted, and siltstone and sandstone placoids.  

In Sete Lagoas, the pedogenic features observed were: (1) nitosoil: argillo-arenaceous grains, 

brown-reddish color and “block” form. Its breaking plane presents a feature known as “cerosity”, a 

result from the concentration of argillous grains; (2) detritus-laterite: rich in mature quartz fragments 

and pebbles, cemented by a white-yellowish siltic-argillous matrix; (3) agrisol: well developed horizons, 



Chapter 5: Geologic conceptual model of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings  

 

Doctoral Thesis 40 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

with well selected clay grains (at the base), grading for arenaceous grains, also with well selected 

grains on the top; (4) latosoil: fine to coarse grains, with well cemented grains by the occurrence of 

aggregated oxides and clay, in addition to having red-yellowish color; (5) neosoil: low diagenetic 

degree, argillous matrix supporting the grains varying among sand, pebble and boulder; and (6) 

alluvial  soil: constituted of alluvial argillo-arenaceous grains, carried by a fluvial body, and it may vary 

to argillo-silty. 

 

Fig. 6. Geologic map of the municipality of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings. The Belo Horizonte 
Complex (gneiss associated to granitoids) occurs in the SSW area. The Sete Lagoas Formation, 
divided by two members (Pedro Leopoldo: fine white limestones; and Lagoa Santa: medium grained 
black limestones) occurs mainly in the SE, W, and in the Santa Helena ridge foothills. The Serra de 
Santa Helena Formation (shales, siltstones, and slate) occurs in the NW, N, and NE regions, while the 
unconsolidated sediments from Cenozoic surface coverage occur along the large meanders and 
drainages. The structural information can be seen separately in the Fig. 11. 
 

4.2. Structural geology  

 

Included in the intermediate structural domain with low intensity of deformation (Tuller et al. 

2009), within the municipality of Sete Lagoas, no lithostructural contacts with thrust features were 

seen, and only abrupt deposition contacts were noted. However, from the lithologic well profiles, 

abrupt changes of depth to the basement were observed. In addition, similar basement level changes 

were observed between its outcrops and the adjacent lithologic well profiles. From these data, it is 

suggested that faults displaced the lower stratigraphic sequences, placing them in contact with upper 



Chapter 5: Geologic conceptual model of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings  

 

Doctoral Thesis 41 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

blocks, which was observed in previous studies, in the eastern most portion of the area, out of the 

municipality Sete Lagoas.  

The upper contact between Sete Lagoas and Serra de Santa Helena formations and Belo 

Horizonte Complex is abrupt, with a low angle. It is preferably developed in bedding rocks, associated 

with slate and phyllite from the Serra de Santa Helena Formation, and to the ductile-ruptile behavior 

phases of the limestone from Sete Lagoas Formation, locally represented by kink bands. In the case 

of Sete Lagoas Formation, the contact between Pedro Leopoldo (basal) and Lagoa Santa (upper) 

members is also abrupt, horizontal and well defined, which was confirmed in all quarry outcrops. 

Sigmoidal deformations were observed specifically in the Lagoa Santa Member, suggesting a stage 

where the formation was deformed in a ductile regimen (Fig. 7).  

The main structures observed in the municipality of Sete Lagoas were fractures, folds, bedding 

planes, and foliations (Fig. 8). The only observed evidence of microfaulting was seen in the Serra de 

Santa Helena Formation, with displacement of a few millimeters, located on the top of the Santa 

Helena Ridge. For the Belo Horizonte Complex, sub-vertical fracture planes are common, with 

NNW/SSE direction, and main attitude N347/83.  

In the case of the Sete Lagoas Formation, in the Pedro Leopoldo Member, the bedding planes 

presented a main orientation of N180/04 (27% of the 54 measured) and fold axis with main attitude 

N052/00 (Fig. 8). Projecting the data from the bedding planes oriented to the North direction, between 

N338/05 to N028/10, a subtle dip to N was seen, with trends to the NW. About the fracture planes, the 

average sub-vertical attitude was N092/67. In the Lagoa Santa Member, the bedding planes are well 

defined, and the most observed attitude was N060/24. Concerning the fold axes, the most frequent 

was N360/13. The structural evidences explain the presence of outcrops in the Lagoa Santa Member 

in lower topography and its occurrence in the center-west of Sete Lagoas. The Serra de Santa Helena 

Formation presents structural features with ductile-ruptile behavior, a consequence of the regional 

tectonic evolution, subdivided in: (1) bedding planes with attitude of N060/03 (15% of the 185 

measured), in addition to the 6 measured related to the fold axis with main attitudes of N009/13; and 

(2) fracturing planes with subvertical character and filled in with quartz or pegmatite veins. The main 

attitude was N013/77 (13% of the 64 measured), following ESE-WSW orientation (Fig. 8).

4.3. Spatial distribution of the geologic formations 

 

The basement outcrops in the SW portion of the study area with elevations between 750 and 

950 m.a.s.l. and dips in the NE direction (Figs. 9, 10, and 11). The minimum surface contact is 

approximately 400 m.a.s.l., located in the north near the Velhas River. The overlying sediments from 

the Sete Lagoas and Serra de Santa Helena formations follow the dip of the basement. 

According to the geologic cross sections, it was possible to propose, indirectly, a horst and 

graben system controlled by faulting, which indicated different basement depths over small lateral 

distances (e.g. 120 m offset in 1.4 km; 140 m in 2.5 km; or 200 m in 5 km). As an example, a lithologic 

well profile, located approximately 800 m from where the basement outcrops, shows a depth to 

basement of 80 m. 

The Sete Lagoas and Serra de Santa Helena formations follow this horst and graben system, 

presenting thinner layers on the basin border in the SW region, and higher thickness in the NE (cross 

sections 1 to 14). In the case of the Sete Lagoas Formation, the limestones dip and become thicker to 

the northeast, being covered almost totally by the Serra de Santa Helena Formation, where these 

limestones arise mainly in the Santa Helena Ridge foothills and in the municipalities located to the 

southeast, near the Velhas River.  

The Serra de Santa Helena Formation is situated immediately over the Sete Lagoas Formation, 

normally with abrupt contact. The contacts with basement are also abrupt, indicating that their 

sediments were deposited in area with little relief. This formation becomes thicker to the NE and 

contains bedding planes, which dip to the NE, and thinner on the basin borders and near the Velhas 

River. These formations can reach 160 m thickness, seen in the north of Sete Lagoas (cross section 

3) and in the Santa Helena Ridge (estimated values).  

The thickness of the Cenozoic surface coverage is low in comparison to the other geologic 

formations. The best representation was seen in the central part of Sete Lagoas (urbanized area) and 

in the western part of this municipality, with approximate values of 40 m in thickness (cross sections 3, 

9, and 10). 

In the urbanized area of Sete Lagoas, for the homonym formation, an antiform was interpreted 

(Fig. 11), with bedding planes oriented to the North (cross section 2) and surface contact around 500 

m.a.s.l. (estimated, seen in section 4) and 580 m.a.s.l. (data from a stratigraphic drill hole made by 

SAAE, located on North of Sete Lagoas – seen in section 3 -  near 40 km in the x-axis). The majority 

of the urbanized area is included in a graben area, filled with limestones and unconsolidated 

sediments (cross sections 3, 10, and 11; also see Fig. 11).  

In the case of the Santa Helena Ridge, located near to the central part of Sete Lagoas, it was 

possible to deduce an upward displacement of the basement, indicated by a horst (cross sections 3, 

10, and 11). This horst might have elevated the stratigraphic sequence, where the Sete Lagoas and 

Serra de Santa Helena formations have more elevated altitudes than other regions. The fact that this 

stratigraphic sequence is cut by fractures filled quartz veins, the ridge is more resistant to erosion.

4.4. Geologic conceptual model 

 

A geologic conceptual model of the municipality of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings (Fig. 12) 

and a schematic synthesis model about the geological evolution were proposed (Fig. 13).  

From the extensional events between 900 and 600 Ma. (Condie 2002) in the São Francisco 

Craton, the São Francisco Basin was originated, depositing silicate-carbonate sediments of the 

Bambuí Group from the Neoproterozoic age, where the study area is included, directly on the border 

of this basin. These Neoproterozoic sediments were deposited on a stable epicontinental shelf with a 

low gradient, which had three regressive sedimentary mega-cycles (with argillo-carbonate origin), 

giving origin to the Sete Lagoas and Serra de Santa Helena formations, respectively.  

Around 740±22 Ma. (Babinski et al 2007), 630 Ma. (Caxito et al. 2012), or 540 Ma. (Warren et 

al. 2014), the Sete Lagoas Formation, by carbonate depositional systems with intermediary internal 

and external ramps (Lima 1997), gave origin to the limestones of the Pedro Leopoldo Member, at the 

base, characterized by fine grained white limestones (in some cases, with dolomite and/or pelite level), 

and the Lagoa Santa Member, on the top, represented by medium grained black limestones.  

Later, over the rocks from the Sete Lagoas Formation, a transgressive cycle (Ribeiro et al. 

2003) characterized by sub-coastal sea and relatively deep and weak flow enabled the deposition of 



Chapter 5: Geologic conceptual model of Sete Lagoas and the surroundings  

 

Doctoral Thesis 47 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

pelite materials with plane-parallel stratums, crossed stratifications, and wave marks giving origin to 

the Serra de Santa Helena Formation. This formation might have achieved minimum thickness values 

as low as 160 m (confirmed in lithologic well profiles). At the end of this cycle, the deposition of 

silicate-carbonate sediments started giving origin to the Lagoa do Jacaré Formation, found in the far 

NNW part of the study area.  

Due to the deformation of the Espinhaço Supergroup in the Brazilian age (~600 Ma.) (Trompette 

et al. 1993) and the proximity of this region (structural domain 1 - higher intensity of deformation) to 

the study area (structural domain 2 – intermediate deformation magnitude), the rocks from the Bambuí 

Group were intensely faulted and bended to the East, close to the stress coming from this deformation 

(Alkmim and Martins Neto 2001). In the west of the area, the structural features were less expressive 

and the sedimentary features were more preserved. These factors resulted in a horst and graben 

system, controlled by faulting, displacing the stratigraphic sequences, which enabled lithologic 

sequences of different ages side by side. Thus, the lower limestones of the Sete Lagoas Formation 

reached the surface in some areas.  

Within the municipality of Sete Lagoas, it was observed that the limestones from the Sete 

Lagoas Formation, especially the Pedro Leopoldo Member, demonstrate important dissolution macro-

features developed either in bedding planes (most frequent) and in subvertical fractures (less 

common). Some of these dissolution zones were filled with terrigenous material, suggesting a past 

meteoric water flow. In the case of the Lagoa Santa Member, the main dissolution features found were 

dry caves and grottoes, suggesting groundwater paleoconduits (e.g. Rei do Mato Cave). These 

evidences could suggest recent geomorphologic processes, such as a past meteoric water flow, or 

could have started at the time when groundwater flow paths started to develop, even if these 

limestones had not yet been exposed. As the timing of these processes is not precisely known, it is 

suggested a specific study to be conducted to better understand more about the origin of these 

processes.  

Finally, the Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments deposited in the central portion of Sete Lagoas 

were a result of weathering and erosion of Santa Helena Ridge. These unconsolidated sediments also 

were deposited along the beds of the Velhas River and in areas of low relief.

5. Conclusion 

 

The uses of data from geologic mapping combined with a good database of lithologic well 

profiles become an efficient set of tool to facilitate the spatial visualization and determine the geometry 

of the geologic formations in the subsurface and its side continuities. This fact also helped to identify 

possible blocks displaced indirectly by faults.  

The study area is along basement border, a result of extensional events in the São Francisco 

Craton, where silicate-carbonate sediments from the Neoproterozoic age were emplaced giving origin 

to the Bambuí Group.  

Due to the relative proximity of this area with the Serra do Espinhaço (situated to the east and 

which undergone intense deformation), the Bambuí Group presents a horst and graben system, 

controlled by faulting, displacing the stratigraphic sequences, which enables formations with different 

ages side by side.  

In relation to the thickness of sedimentary layers, the NE portion of the area is estimated to 

approximately 400 m, near the Velhas River.  

According to lithological well profiles, the limestones from the Sete Lagoas Formation present 

horizontal continuity, from the basement border to the Velhas River.  

The Santa Helena Ridge was interpreted as a horst, which elevated the stratigraphic sequence, 

causing the Sete Lagoas and Serra de Santa Helena formations to have higher altitudes than in other 

regions. Considering that fracture filled quartz veins cut this stratigraphic sequence, the ridge became 

more resistant to erosion.

Abstract 

 

Collecting and interpreting permeability data in karst systems is considered complicated due to three 

distinct properties of these systems. First, the permeability distribution of high permeability features 

may be as one-dimensional features that are difficult to detect with wells, or may be so high in the 

wells that the upper measurement limit is encountered during aquifer testing. Secondly, turbulent flow 

may make the application of continuum hydraulic principles difficult. Finally, permeability commonly 

has a scale effect in which permeability in these systems increases with the scale of measurement. 

The aquifer for Sete Lagoas, Brazil, is used to evaluate a permeability combination model 

methodology to test the permeability structure across a range of spatial scales in order to develop a 

quantitative model of permeable features that is consistent across all scales of measurement, from 

matrix properties to regional-scale flow. The aquifer in this study has some wells that do not have 

measurable drawdown during pumping due to high permeability. Permeability data indicated an 

increase in permeability from the small- to the well-scale and a decrease from the well- to regional-

scale. This is due to the localized development of karst bedding plane dissolution in one structurally 

controlled region of an aquifer with low matrix permeability. The results show that, based on 

measurement technique, the permeability data vary over many orders of magnitude, while the physical 

size of permeable features of the aquifer are consistent across the scales of data collection with less 

than an order of magnitude variation. The aquifer geometry of these hydraulically active features 

provides a quantitative understanding of the scale effects of permeability measurements. 

 

Keywords: karst, permeability, transmissivity, hydraulic conductivity, scale effect, Brazil. 

 

1. Introduction 

  

Formation bulk permeability depends on the shape, amount, and interconnectivity of void 

spaces, or permeability structure. This is often quantified with testing in the form of hydraulic 

conductivity or transmissivity values, which incorporate fluid properties and aquifer dimensions into the 

measurements. Grain size analyses, permeameters, aquifer tests and groundwater models are most 

commonly used to obtain permeability estimates from small- to regional-scales. However, the 

permeability values can vary within a wide range over orders of magnitude, depending on the 

geological formation. While flow properties are determined in rock bodies as hydraulic conductivity, 



Chapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  

Doctoral Thesis 70 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

transmissivity, or permeability, permeability data are the fundamental property of the rock body and 

most easily converted to the physical dimensions of pores, fractures, or conduits. This work will 

assume that fractures are two dimensional features and conduits are conceptually one dimensional 

flow features. 

Karstic carbonate rocks are one of the most heterogeneous and anisotropic of all formations 

found in nature, because the permeability structure of these formations are created by fluid flow 

generating a hierarchal rock structure of flow features that facilitates circulation in the downgradient 

direction (Mangin, 1975). Consequently, karst hydraulic parameters are not an independent, inherited 

static attribute of the rock, but rather are dynamic over geological time (Huntoon, 1985). Another 

consideration is that this structure can adjust as the flow regime responds to changing hydraulic 

boundary conditions. Thus, the hierarchy of permeability pathways and their organization within the 

formation are dictated by the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow system operating within the 

recent geological past and, to a variable degree, the characteristics of older flow systems (Ewers, 

1982). 

The difficulties in the estimation of karst permeability are amplified by flow that may be non- 

Darcian, which leads to the cautious use of continuum estimations that assume Darcian flow. 

Depending on the dissolution feature size, causing locally high permeability, some standard aquifer 

tests may obtain no measurable drawdown as the test reaches the upper measurement limit, making 

calculations of transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity values only a lower bound estimate (Halihan et 

al., 1999). These factors resulting in uncertainties in making permeability estimates are a key factor to 

understand groundwater flow and solute transport in the subsurface (Quinlan and Ewers, 1985; 

Rehfeldt et al., 1989).  

These formations and their heterogeneity can lead to well-known permeability scale effects 

(Ratz, 1967; Király, 1975; Maclay and Land, 1988; Hovorka et al., 1995; Halihan et al., 1999). Scale 

effects are generally defined as continual increases in permeability magnitude from small- to regional-

scale estimates (Király, 1975; Schulze-Makuch et al., 1999). In the Király (1975) study, made in 

Mesozoic fractured and karstic limestone aquifers located in the Jura Mountains, Switzerland, it was 

hypothesized that the increase from small- to the well-scale was caused by fractures, and that the 

largest permeabilities on the regional-scale were caused by karstic conduits. Halihan et al. (2000) 

tested if the Király (1975) hypothesis has an underlying physical basis using a permeability database 

for the Cretaceous carbonates from the San Antonio segment of the Edwards aquifer and found that 

the Király hypothesis was applicable for that aquifer, with nine orders of magnitude variability in 

permeability. In another study, Clauser (1992), analyzing a compilation of different type of crystalline 

rocks, noted that the permeability can increase three orders of magnitude from small- to well-scale, but 

from well- to regional-scale, the increase would not continue, but the Halihan et al. (2000) model 

indicated that if larger fractures were present, the permeability would continue to increase with scale. 

Many of these approaches compiled permeability data at a range of scales, but few provide a physical 

basis for the values to allow increased predictability and scalability. 

One approach to quantify the physical basis of the scale effect is via permeability combination 

models (PCM), providing estimates of the averaged permeability generated by a mixture of different 

permeable features in an aquifer, or the numerical effect of small-scale features on the well- or 



Chapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  

Doctoral Thesis 71 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

regional-scale data (Halihan et al., 1998; 1999; 2000). These models are steady-scale geometric 

models that estimate the effects of different heterogeneities on formation permeability structure, 

assuming measurements on different scales are all valid estimates for the scale the data were 

collected. These models are modifications of equations for layered aquifers (Leonards, 1962; Fetter, 

1994).  

To predict formation values at the well-scale in a karstic formation, standard aquifer tests (slug 

tests, time-drawdown tests and step-drawdown tests) and the standard analytical equations (e.g. 

Theis, 1935; Cooper and Jacob, 1946), assuming Darcian flow, often provide reasonable fits to the 

data (Kresic, 2013). These estimates should be used with caution, due to anisotropic or potential non-

Darcian conditions. Additionally, these estimates may not be valid on a regional-scale, due to scale 

dependency. In case of regions with limited pumping test data, but having specific capacity test data, 

an alternative method to estimate permeability from these data utilizes empirical relationships between 

transmissivity and specific capacity (Razack and Huntley, 1991; Mace 1997). In cases with no 

measurable drawdown occurring in a well, due to high permeability, a lower bound estimate can be 

obtained using a Thiem (1906) method (Halihan et al., 2000).  

On the regional-scale, groundwater models can be used to obtain permeability estimates 

(Scanlon et al., 2001; 2003), but other analytical approaches are available as well. One of these other 

techniques is using a regional capture zone analysis, defined as the area of an aquifer in which all the 

water will be removed by a pumping well or wells within a certain time period (Todd, 1980; Grubb, 

1993). In some cases, equations can be superimposed to calculate the capture zone of multiple well 

systems (Javandel and Tsang, 1986). 

In this research, an evaluation of multi-scale permeability structure, estimating values of 

permeability at the small-, well-, and regional-scale (along with hydraulic conductivity and 

transmissivity) was conducted. These data were compared against observations of the physical size of 

permeable features, as well as calculations of the hydraulic dimension of fractures (hydraulic 

apertures) and conduits (hydraulic diameters). Combining different methodologies, a quantitative 

hydrogeologic conceptual model was developed, consistent across all scales of measurement. The 

aquifer studied was the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer (Pessoa, 1996), located within the limits of the 

municipality of Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. This aquifer has common complications for karst 

systems with meter scale pores and some pumping tests that obtain no measurable drawdown. 

Quantifying these parameters through different scales is important because of the increasing demands 

on the aquifer, which require users to have a quantitative understanding of how the aquifer functions, 

so that it can be properly utilized and protected. For this, the PCM approach was utilized, comparing 

small-scale permeability data calculated by a permeameter with well-scale parameters calculated by 

standard pumping tests and an estimated regional-scale value, via capture zone analysis of a multiple 

pumping well system. These calculations were made to test possible correlations between different 

ranges of scale and quantify variations in the permeability scale effect. The hypothesis is that while 

values of permeability vary over many orders of magnitude, the hydraulic dimensions of flow features 

controlling permeability measurements would remain a consistent physically quantifiable dataset for 

the aquifer.

2. Site description 

 

The aquifer studied was the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer (Pessoa, 1996), located in the 

municipality of Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais, Brazil, 70 km northwest of Belo Horizonte, the state capital 

(Fig. 1). This municipality has a population greater than 200,000 over an area of 538 km
2
 (IBGE, 

2010). The greatest population density is located in the older urbanized areas of the city. The current 

water supply is almost entirely groundwater from the aquifer sourced from private and public wells. 

The public supply wells are managed by the Water Supply and Sewage Service (SAAE) [SAAE - 

Serviço de Abastecimento de Água e Esgoto]. The highest pumping rates are located in areas with the 

greatest population density (Fig. 1).  

Geologically, the area is located in the São Francisco Craton, where carbonate argillo-

arenaceous sediments are emplaced giving origin to the Bambuí Group (Branco and Costa, 1961; 

Oliveira, 1967; Schöll and Fogaça, 1973; Dardene, 1978; Schobbenhaus, 1984; Ribeiro et al., 2003; 

Tuller et al., 2010; Galvão et al., in press). The hydrostratigraphic relationships for the Sete Lagoas 

karst aquifer and spatial distribution are given in Pessoa (1996) and Galvão et al. (2015). The aquifer, 

which is approximately 75 meters thick, consists of Neoproterozoic limestones, composed of two 

members: the Pedro Leopoldo Member (at the base) and the Lagoa Santa Member (on the top), in 

which the primary porosity and matrix permeability can be considered low (Moore, 1989) and the 

secondary porosity is mostly filled by the precipitation of calcite (Tonietto, 2010). The majority of 

groundwater migrates through dissolution features characterized as tertiary porosity. 

According to Galvão et al. (2015), results from geologic mapping and optical well logging 

suggest that the urbanized area of Sete Lagoas (Fig. 1) is primarily located in a graben, filled with 

limestones from Sete Lagoas Formation, overlying Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments, and 

occasionally covered by competent rocks from the Serra de Santa Helena Formation (slate, marble, 

siltstone and argillite). This setting results in fault bounded barrier boundaries for groundwater, which 

together with natural karst processes, explains the location of two dominant solutionally enlarged 

bedding planes in the Sete Lagoas formation with high permeability and significant storage capacity: 

1) a shallower and thicker continuous dissolution zone with conduits that are 1-8 m thick, near the 

contact with the overlying unconsolidated sediments; and 2) 10-20 m below, a thinner continuous 

dissolution zone with conduits that are 20 cm to 1 m thick. These limestones dip and become thicker 

(reaching about 160 m thickness) and are completely covered by rocks from the Serra de Santa 

Helena Formation to the northeast. The two bedding plane conduits become thinner to the northeast.  

The hydrogeologic conceptual model for the aquifer in the urbanized area includes both non-

karstic and karstic bedding plane apertures based on optical well logs and outcrop field observations 

(Fig 2). This conceptual model is based on previous work conducted for a karst risk assessment 

(Galvão et al., 2015). The terms "non-karstic bedding planes" for zones without karstification, and 

"solutionally enlarged bedding planes" for dissolution zones will be used here.

3. Methods  

 

The evaluation of scale effects in this research first involved building a database of permeability 

measurements from small- to regional-scales for the aquifer. Small-scale permeabilities were 

measured by means of a hand-held air permeameter. Well-scale evaluation utilized aquifer tests and a 

relationship derived between specific capacity and transmissivity. A regional-scale estimate utilized 

potentiometric surface measurements and a capture zone analysis.  

Once the multi-scale database of permeability was available, empirical calculations were utilized 

to invert the database values to determine what size hydraulic features (i.e. pore diameter, fracture 

hydraulic aperture, or conduit hydraulic diameters) would be required to obtain measured field values 

of formation permeabilities. These inverted hydraulic values were utilized in a forward modeling PCM 

approach similar to Halihan et al. (1999) to test the stability of hydraulic features across the scales of 

data. These methods will be presented sequentially from the bulk permeability database to the 

inverted estimate of the size of hydraulic features, and finally the PCM forward modeling. 

For this paper, the name of each order of magnitude for scale was based on Király (1975). 

These dimensions included: 1) small-scale from 10
-2

 to 10
0
 m, utilizing a rock matrix permeameter 

analysis; 2) well-scale between 10
0
 and 10

2 
m, by pumping test drawdown radius of influence; and 3) 

regional-scale from 10
2
 to 10

4 
m, according to the size of the capture zone analysis of the multiple 

pumping well system. 

 

3.1. Permeability database 

 

For this work, small-scale measurements utilize hand samples and thin sections of aquifer 

matrix. This measurement scale is occasionally divided by authors into a hand-scale and a micro-

scale, but they are combined here to represent measurements of carbonate matrix pore properties. 

Well-scale data commonly are derived from aquifer tests. In this case, wells that have reached their 

testing measurement limit by not being able to draw down the water table are included in the analysis. 

Finally, while many authors utilize groundwater model data for regional estimates (Thorkildsen and 

McElhaney, 1992; Halihan et al., 2000; Scanlon et al., 2001; 2003), this work utilizes an analytical 

capture zone solution. 

 

3.1.1. Small-scale: matrix data, optical microscopy analysis and permeability measurements 

Field observations and optical microscopy using thin section for the two members of the 

Neoproteozoic limestone rocks from the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer were made in order to describe the 

features of the matrix, such as rock mineralogy, grain size and micro-fractures. To measure the 

permeabilities in the matrix of these members, a TinyPerm II portable hand-held air permeameter, 

manufactured by New England Research (NER), was utilized. 

Permeability measurements were performed on dry hand samples of limestones sourced from 

the two members of the Sete Lagoas formation. The measurements were collected across dry, fresh 

and planar rock surface free of dust and without any weathering effects. Measurements (24 total) were 

taken to determine the mean small-scale permeability, ksm, in darcys. These measurements were 



Chapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  

Doctoral Thesis 75 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

converted to square meters, and then estimates of the small-scale hydraulic conductivity, Ksm, and 

transmissivity, Tsm, of the entire aquifer thickness were calculated. The advantage of this non-

destructive method is the rapid and reproducible results (Fossen et al., 2011). 

 

3.1.2. Well-scale: aquifer test data and empirical relationship analysis 

Seven long duration (48 hours) transient pumping tests were conducted to measure the well-

scale transmissivity, Tw [L
2
/t], using the Theis (1935) method. Pumping rates ranged from 47 to 194 

m
3
/h. For the case of a zero drawdown well test in well PT-01, the Thiem equation (Thiem, 1906) was 

used for analysis by assuming 0.01 m (1 cm) of drawdown in the pumping well. This well and the 

observation wells at distances of 25 m and 51 m were located in the central portion of the urbanized 

area. This test involved pumping PT-01 at a constant rate, Qw [L
3
/t], of 130 m

3
/h (see Table S1 in the 

electronic supplementary material (ESM) for more information about pumping wells, well coordinates, 

and respective pumping rates and observation wells).  

Twenty-seven time-drawdown or step-drawdown tests to estimate specific capacity, SC [L
2
/t], 

were made utilizing the SAAE’s supply wells. In mathematical terms, SC is defined as the pumping rate 

in the well, Qw [L
3
/t], divided by the observed decline in hydraulic head in the well, ?hw [L], from an 

aquifer test. In the case of the step-drawdown tests, every discharge value was divided by its 

respective drawdown, ?hw, observed in each step, and then the mean SC was calculated. These 

results were analyzed by an empirical relationship derived for this karst aquifer by fitting a power law 

function between measured specific capacity and transmissivity, based on the Razack and Huntley 

(1991) and Mace (1997) methods. The goal was to estimate the most representative well-scale 

transmissivity, and then estimate the well-scale hydraulic conductivity, Kw [L/t], both in non-karstic and 

solutionally enlarged bedding planes, to estimate the well-scale permeability. Information about the 

physical thickness of bedding planes, bw [L], were taken via optical well logging and outcrop field 

observations (Galvão et al., 2015). 

A transmissivity map was constructed from the data to observe the variability at the regional 

scale from well scale data (Fig. 4). For this, Tw values were utilized assuming the long duration 

pumping test data were more accurate data than the empirical values from specific capacity data. It 

was assumed that the values that were found in the observation wells for their respective pumping 

wells were located in the same hydrogeologic setting (Table S1 in the electronic supplementary 

material (ESM)).   

 

3.1.3. Regional-scale: potentiometric data and capture zone analysis 

To develop a potentiometric map for regional-scale permeability evaluation, measurements of 

the water table were taken only in SAAE's supply wells in the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer. The well 

casing elevation data were acquired using a SRTM image (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission). 

According to Demétrio et al. (2006), the accuracy in the use of this data is less than 5 m, which makes 

the data a viable and economical source.  

A capture zone analysis for the central high pumping rate well area was performed and an 

assessment of the accuracy of the analytical results was estimated. For this, some assumptions were 

made, such as pumping wells in a confined aquifer with a uniform flow, under steady-state conditions. 



Chapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  

Doctoral Thesis 76 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

From the potentiometric map, a capture zone area was determined, based on estimated flow lines in 

the potentiometric surface. Based on this geometry, analytical equations derived for confined aquifers 

by Todd (1980) and Grubb (1993) delineating the edge of the capture zone were used to estimate the 

regional-scale transmissivity, Tr [L
2
/t]: 

        
  

     
                                                                                          

        
  
    

                                                                                            

where Tr,x and Tr,y [L
2
/t] are the regional transmissivities in their respective directions, Qr [L

3
/t] is the 

overall pumping rate or regional discharge rate, XL [L] is the distance from the pumping well to the 

downgradient edge of the capture zone (stagnation point), YL [L] is the half width of the maximum 

capture zone, and i [dimensionless] is the hydraulic gradient.  

The regional discharge rate, Qr, was estimated by summing the pumping rate data values from 

public supply wells (data provided by SAAE and Servmar Environmental &amp;amp; Engineering) and private 

wells (data acquired from the SIAGAS's database - SIAGAS, 2006) extracting groundwater within the 

capture zone. The next step was to estimate the transmissivity, Tr, based on the best fit-empirical 

capture zone in comparison to the potentiometric capture zone, using the equation that describes the 

empirical edge of the capture zone for a confined aquifer: 

    
  

    
      
  

 
                                                                                             

where x [L] is the distance parallel to the regional hydraulic gradient and y [L] is the distance 

perpendicular to the regional hydraulic gradient (Todd, 1980; Grubb, 1993). A sensitivity analysis was 

conducted to evaluate the variability possible in this approach. 

The final Tr was considered the average of both analytical values calculated, while the regional-

scale hydraulic conductivity, Kr [L/t], was calculated by dividing these transmissivity values by the total 

thickness, btotal [L] (estimated at 75 m), and then converted the values to permeability in square 

meters.  

Finally, all these permeability data sets were entered in a GIS database and georeferenced in 

the ArcGIS 10.1 software. The coordinate system was Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) 

projection, Zone 23, datum SAD 69, with units in meters. Data from optical well logs and analytical 

calculation results were considered to estimate the physical sizes of the dissolution zones, br [L]. 

These values allowed a comparison between observed physical apertures and inverted hydraulic 

apertures for the various data. 

 

3.2. Permeability component data 

 

In order to test the stability of permeability feature sizes across various scales of measurement, 

permeability data were inverted to determine the physical size of hydraulic features that would be 

capable of producing the various permeability values. This included calculating the hydraulic size of 

fracture apertures and conduit diameters, both under assumed laminar and turbulent flow conditions.

3.2.1. Sub-horizontal fracture hydraulic apertures  

The conversion between permeability values and the size of a sub-horizontal fracture was 

calculated using the cubic law (Lamb 1932) allowing a relationship between the intrinsic permeability 

of a fracture, kf, [L
2
] and a fracture hydraulic aperture, bf  [L]:  

    
  
 

  
                                                                                              

This relationship allows the conversion between measured permeability values and physical 

feature size. It is only an approximation in that it does not accommodate for fracture plane roughness 

and variability in fracture geometry. 

The hydraulic fracture aperture was calculated from transmissivity or conductivity data from 

aquifer tests using the hydraulic aperture of a single low-angle fracture equation (Halihan et al. 1999), 

bf  [L]: 

     
         

 
                

   

                                                                  

where ? is the kinematic viscosity of the water [L
2
/t], Tw is the well-scale transmissivity [L

2
/t] calculated 

by pumping test, Ksm is the small-scale hydraulic conductivity of the matrix [L/t], btotal is the total 

thickness of aquifer [L], g is gravitational constant [L/t
2
], and ? is the angle between the fracture and 

the horizontal plane, which is zero if the fracture is horizontal. 

 

3.2.2. Hydraulic conduit diameters 

The hydraulic conductivity of a conduit, Kc [L/t], can be related to a conduit hydraulic diameter 

assuming both laminar and turbulent flow (Halihan et al. 1998). These hydraulic conductivity equations 

can also be converted to permeability, but to illustrate the turbulent case, hydraulic conductivity is 

simpler to illustrate. The laminar hydraulic conductivity, Kc,lam [L/t]: 

         
   

 

   
                                                                                       

For turbulent hydraulic conductivity Kc,turb [L/t]: 

               
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
  
 
 

 
 

                                                                               

To estimate the hydraulic conduit diameter, dc [L], from aquifer tests, the single horizontal 

conduit equation was utilized (Halihan et al. 1999), assuming the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix is 

much less than the hydraulic conductivity of the conduit, Kc:  

    
    
      

      
       
  

     
  
  
                                                                   

Substituting dc in the equation (6), to estimate the laminar hydraulic conduit diameter, dc,lam [L]: 

              
 

 
 

 
 
                                                                                     

Substituting dc in the equation (7), to estimate the turbulent hydraulic conduit diameter, dc,turb [L]: 

             
 
 
 

 
 
 

      

 
  

                                                                             



Chapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  

Doctoral Thesis 78 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

The use of these equations allows permeability data from the range of scales to be inverted into 

a hydraulic feature size. These estimates should be smaller than the physical size of the features 

estimated from optical logging or outcrop evaluation, as they are hydraulic dimensions, not physical 

ones. This set of equations allowed inversion of the permeability database and the same concept can 

be used to generate forward models for evaluation of permeability scale effects. 

 

3.3. Permeability combination models 

 

For the permeability combination forward model approach (PCM) to evaluate the scale effects in 

the karst aquifer, the analytical models developed for small- to regional-scale were combined and 

compared. These models are steady state and modifications of equations for layered aquifers. In 

addition, others assumptions were used to simplify the models, such as: 1) the hydraulic conductivity 

of the matrix is much less than the hydraulic conductivity of the fracture/conduit (this can be evaluated 

by utilizing the permeability database); and 2) according to Galvão et al. (2015), the solutionally 

enlarged bedding planes are continuous permeable features controlling the hydraulic system, where 

sub-vertical fractures do not have significant influence on permeability structure across the scales of 

measurement.  

For the inverted hydraulic dimensions, the equations used to estimate the values for each scale 

were: equation (4) at the small-scale; equations (5), (9) and (10) at the well-scale for both laminar and 

turbulent flow; and the respective equations (4), (9), and (10) were assumed to estimate the hydraulic 

dimensions at the regional-scale. 

 

4. Results  

 

The results will be presented sequentially from the bulk permeability measurements, to the 

inverted estimate of the size of hydraulic features, and finally the PCM results. 

 

4.1. Sete Lagoas permeability database  

 

The permeability database for Sete Lagoas illustrates that permeability values do not always 

increase with scale. A figure illustrating the Sete Lagoas permeability scale effect, compared against 

the Király (1975), Clauser (1992) and Halihan et al. (2000) studies, as well as with igneous rock, 

limestone, karst, and gravel permeabilities (Heath, 1983) was generated to illustrate the effect in 

comparison to other carbonate aquifers (Fig. 6). 

 

4.1.1. Small-scale analysis and measurements 

Optical microscopy analysis indicates the Neoproteozoic limestones from the Pedro Leopoldo 

Member (at the base) and the Lagoa Santa Member (on the top) are low permeability competent 

bedrock, with the secondary porosity (i.e. micro-fractures) generally filled by calcite. The rocks from 

Pedro Leopoldo Member are composed of 85% micrite, 8% sparite and 7% quartz, classified as 

micrite (Folk, 1959) or mudstone (Dunham, 1962), while the rocks from Lagoa Santa Member are 55% 



Chapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  

Doctoral Thesis 79 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

sparite, 30% ooids, and 15% micrite, classified as an oobiosparite (Folk, 1959) or grainstone 

(Dunham, 1962). These low porosity limestone features are in accordance with Moore (1989) and 

Tonietto (2010).  

Hand sample TinyPerm measurements indicate no significant differences in permeability 

between the Pedro Leopoldo and Lagoa Santa members. The matrix permeabilities in the Sete 

Lagoas Formation, combining both members, range from 1.9 x 10
-16

 to 4.2 x 10
-15

 m
2
. This results in 

hydraulic conductivity values, Ksm, between 1.6 x 10
-4

 and 3.5 x 10
-3

 m/d (1.9 x 10
-9

 to 4.1 x 10
-8

 m/s). 

The matrix transmissivities,    , based on the mean total thickness of aquifer, btotal = 75 m, are 

between 1.2 x 10
-2

 and 2.6 x 10
-1

 m
2
/d (1.4 x 10

-7
 to 3.1 x 10

-6
 m

2
/s) (Table S2 of the ESM). These 

measurements are in accordance with values for limestone in other settings (Freeze and Cherry, 

1979), where permeability values of the matrix for limestone are approximately 10
-13

 to 10
-16

 m
2
 and 

the hydraulic conductivities are between 10
-6

 and 10
-9

 m/s. The results are on the lower end of the 

range, but the values are consistent for limestone with secondary calcite precipitation. 

 

4.1.2. Well-scale: aquifer test data and empirical relationship analysis 

The seven long duration transient pumping tests that were conducted in wells with karst bedding 

planes indicated a range of well-scale transmissivities (Tw) from 90 m
2
/d, in the northeast region, to 

around 3600 m
2
/d, close to the Santa Helena Ridge foothills. Wells tested in the central urbanized 

area also showed high Tw values, above 1500 m
2
/d, while wells located in the northeast region, 

generally, indicated low values, below 500 m
2
/d (Table S1 of the ESM). The well-scale hydraulic 

conductivity values found (Kw) are in accordance with the Tw results, showing high values in the central 

area and low numbers in the northeast region (Table 1). 

In a particular pumping test, conducted in the PT-01, central area, no drawdown was observed. 

For this zero drawdown well, the Thiem equation was used to estimate a transmissivity value (Table 

S1 of the ESM). Using a pumping rate of 130 m
3
/h from the test, and assuming a drawdown of 0.01 m 

(1 cm), and the respective distances of 25 and 51 m of the piezometers PT-02 and PT-03 from the 

pumping well PT-01, the result showed a transmissivity of 6 x 10
4
 m

2
/d (6 x 10

-1
 m

2
/s). This would 

results, based on an aquifer thickness of 75 m, in a local hydraulic conductivity of 700 m/d (8 x 10
-3

 

m/s), and a permeability of 8 x 10
-10

 m
2
. The uncertainty in these calculations may limit them as 

permeability data, but ignoring them adds bias. These data represent the highest well permeabilities in 

the aquifer and are 5 orders of magnitude above the highest small-scale measurements.  

The results of the specific capacity test analysis indicated results similar to previous research 

(Razack and Huntley, 1991; Mace, 1997). A plot of the logarithms of transmissivity and specific 

capacity values for the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer appears linear in log-log space (Fig. 3). The best-fit 

line to these data was: 

           
     

where Tw and Sc are in m
2
/d. The coefficient of determination, R

2
, was 0.55.

Fig. 3. Relationship between specific capacity and transmissivity values for the Sete Lagoas karst 
aquifer, showing the best-fit line. 
 

To evaluate if this empirical equation was reliable, a Tw recalculation was made and compared 

to the Tw values obtained in the seven pumping tests (Table S1 of the ESM). This comparison showed 

reasonable results, generally of the same order of magnitude, which was expected due to some 

inherent uncertainties of this method (Razack and Huntley, 1991; Mace, 1997).  

Utilizing the best    data over the various portions of the aquifer (Table 1 and Table S2 of the 

ESM), a transmissivity map was made (Fig. 4). The highest well-scale transmissivities, Tw = 1,500 - 

3,600 m
2
/d (1.7 x 10

-2 
- 4.1 x 10

-2
 m

2
/s) and the zero drawdown well test (located in the area of the 

solutionally enlarged bedding plane) are concentrated in the central area, within the graben area and 

close to the Santa Helena Ridge foothills. A decrease in these values occurs in the northeast direction, 

Tw = 90 - 250 m
2
/d (1.1 x 10

-3 
- 2.9 x 10

-3 
m

2
/s) (Fig. 4). These values coincide with the optically 

observed fracture apertures of the solutionally enlarged bedding planes described by Galvão et al. 

(2015), where the thicker apertures are located in the central graben area and close to the Santa 

Helena Ridge foothills.   

These data suggest a direct relationship between karstified fracture apertures and high well 

transmissivities. In the case of Kw, dividing both results from the central and the north portions by the 

respective thickness of the aquifer, the hydraulic conductivity values range from 1 to 36 m/d (1.2 x 10
-5

 

- 4.2 x 10
-4

 m/s) (Table 1 and Table S2 of the ESM). This would result in well-scale permeability, kw, 

values of 1.2 x 10
-12

 and 4.2 x 10
-11

 m
2
, respectively. These results represent an increase of 2 to 4 

orders of magnitude above the highest small-scale permeability values.

are concentrated in the central area, close to the Santa Helena Ridge foothills, and in the eastern 
portion of the city. The majority of these high values are located within a central graben area, including 
the "zero drawdown well" controlled by the solutionally enlarged bedding planes. The dashed lines 
indicate uncertainties. The graben area boundary was based on the delineation of Galvão et al. 
(2015). 
 

4.1.3. Regional-scale: potentiometric data and capture zone analysis 

To estimate the regional-scale permeability, a capture zone method in a multiple well system 

was applied. According to the potentiometric data and approximate flow lines (Fig. 5), the Santa 

Helena Ridge is a watershed boundary, where the eastern portion of the map has the groundwater 

flowing to the northeast, while the western portion has the groundwater flowing to the northwest. In the 

central area, there is a flow convergence, generated by a considerable cone of depression, explained 

by the high pumping rate in the central wells. In this specific area, a capture zone was recognized (Fig. 

5a).  

Utilizing equations (1) and (2), with a stagnation point (XL) = - 2,000 m; half width of capture 

zone (YL) =± 4,000 m; regional pumping rate (Qr) = 75,000 m
3
/d; and hydraulic gradient (i) = 0.008 

(Fig. 5a, b), the analytical regional-scale transmissivities, Tr [L
2
/t], were estimated: 

        
      

                       
                               

        
      

             
                                

With transmissivities between 750 and 1,170 m
2
/d, this would results in an analytical regional-

scale hydraulic conductivities from 10 to 16 m/d (1.2 x 10

. This represents a three order of magnitude increase over 

the small-scale measurements, but a decrease relative to many of the well-scale data.  

To evaluate the possible variability using this analytical methodology, a sensitivity analysis was 

conducted adjusting Tw values within this capture zone, found in the Fig. 4 (Tw = 700 - 1,000; 3,000 

m
2
/d) to assess the relative accuracy (Fig. 5c). The best-fit empirical capture zone was found with a 

transmissivity = 900 m

2
/s - see black continuous and dashed lines on Fig. 5c), which 

would result in a hydraulic conductivity of 12 m/d (1.4 x 10

 m/s) and permeability of 1.4 x 10

. 

The calculation of the best-fit empirical capture zone can be seen below: 

Part A: half width of the capture zone, XL [L]: 

      
      

           
          

Part B: distance to the stagnation point, XL [L]: 

      
      

                  
            

Part C: shape of the curve describing the capture zone, x [L]. The following values are for one-half of 

the capture zone, which is symmetrical about the x-axis: 

 

In the case of a possible lower estimate of pumping rate value from private wells that perhaps 

were not included in the analysis (no data or not being registered) and, thus, not added to the final Qr 

value used in the calculations above, a sensitivity analysis also tested the effects of pumping rate (Fig. 

5d). The transmissivity was fixed at 900 m
2
/d (best-fit) adjusting only the pumping rate. The result 

showed that, using Qr  = 100,000 m
3
/d, the value of XL had no significant change, while YL had a small 

change. Now, using Qr = 50,000 and 150,000 m
3
/d, there was a significant change, both in XL and YL. 

However, if some private wells data have not been included, the majority are residential wells, with 

lower pumping rates, which is not significant in the total sum of Qr. The public wells located within the 

captured zone that were included in the analysis represent the highest pumping rates and have the 

greatest impact on the discharge value used in the equations.

permeability of the matrix is between 10

and 10

bedrock, with the secondary porosity generally filled by calcite. The hydraulic fracture aperture, bsm, 

required to generate this level of permeability would be considered between 10
-8 

and 10
-7 

m (or 0.01 

and 0.1 ?m). These values are in accordance with values for limestone pore diameters of the matrix, 

?sm, around 0.1 ?m (Zinszer and Pellerin 2007). 

 

4.1.2. Well-scale permeable feature sizes 

Using empirical hydraulic equations for estimating sub-horizontal fracture apertures, the results 

analyzed for each well showed that the hydraulic fracture aperture, bf, has a range of 1 - 4 mm. For 

the estimated hydraulic conduit diameter, assuming laminar flow, dc,lam, the result is between 2 - 5 mm, 

while assuming turbulent flow, the hydraulic conduit diameter, dc,turb, ranges from 2 to 13 mm (Table 

1). The mechanical apertures seen in the optical well logs showed local values between 0.2 m and 8 

m, which illustrates a large difference between hydraulic and physical feature size, with hydraulic sizes 

being orders of magnitude smaller. These empirical hydraulic values are a combination of both the 

flow from the upper and lower bedding planes, as the values of Tw used in the equations (5), (9) and 

(10) were from pumping tests simultaneously extracting water from the two bedding planes. 

 

4.1.3. Regional-scale: overall bedding planes and karst aquifer thicknesses 

Using values of Tr found via regional capture zone method to estimate the values of regional 

hydraulic fracture aperture, laminar and turbulent conduit in that range, the respective equations (4), 

(9), and (10) were assumed. The combined results ranged between 2 to 6 mm (fracture aperture: 2 - 3 

mm, laminar flow conduit: 3 - 4 mm, and turbulent flow conduit: 5 - 6 mm), slightly lower than the well-

scale hydraulic size. 

 

4.3. Permeability combination model 

 

Combining different approaches for different scales, according to the basic model of two 

bedding planes (Fig. 2), it was possible to accommodate appropriately the small-, well-, and regional-

scales of measurement and compare the values against a conceptual model of hydraulic features. 

These forward models were used to test whether the hydraulic feature sizes of the inverse conceptual 

model could be extended across the scale of measurements for a single quantitative conceptual model 

for the aquifer. For the Sete Lagoas permeability combination model, the only significant permeable 

features were the two solutionally enlarged bedding planes in the aquifer. The model assumes that the 

measured permeabilities at the various scales are valid estimates of permeability at each scale.  

At the small-scale, the mean permeability of the matrix is very low (from 10
-16 

to 10
-15

 m
2
) (Fig. 

6), because the matrix is composed of a Neoproterozoic fine-grained (Pedro Leopoldo Member, at the 

base) and a medium-grained (Lagoa Santa Member, on the top) limestone, with the secondary 

porosity (micro-fractures) generally filled by calcite. Relative to the bedding plane features, these 

values can be approximated on time scales for pumping or regional flow estimates as zero. For the 

simple conceptual model across the scales, a value of 10
-15

 m
2
 was assumed to represent the matrix 

permeability. 



Chapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  

Doctoral Thesis 85 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

In the case of well-scale permeability features, an increase of between four and six orders of 

magnitude in comparison to the matrix (10
-12

 - 10
-10

 m
2
) is noted (Fig. 6), due to the solutionally 

enlarged bedding planes. Regarding the zero drawdown wells, the result showed permeability around 

10
-9

 m
2
. The inversion indicates that these can be simulated as a single hydraulic fracture that is 1 - 2 

mm in size in the non-karstified bedding plane regions (values from fracture apertures) and 2 - 13 mm 

in size in the karstified region depending (values from laminar, 2 - 5 mm, and turbulent conduit 

diameters, 2 - 13 mm) on whether the model allowed for turbulent flow (Table 1). For the simple 

conceptual model for the system, a non-karstic fracture with a 1 mm aperture and a karstic fracture 

with a 5 mm aperture were assumed. At the well-scale in a 75 meter thick aquifer, these fractures yield 

permeabilities of 10
-12

 m
2
 in non-karstic areas and 10

-10
 m

2
 in karstic areas. 

At the regional-scale, the values of permeability have a slightly smaller value in comparison to 

the largest well-scale values. The regional-scale permeability was approximately 10
-11

 m
2
 (Fig. 6). The 

inverted permeability sizes were 2 - 6 mm though, consistent with the non-karstic and karstified 

bedding plane estimate at the well-scale. For the simple conceptual model of the system at the 

regional-scale, the regional value of permeability was 10
-11

 m
2
 for the area encompassed by the 

capture zone analysis. This estimate can be reached by assuming a 2 mm fracture existing over the 

regional-scale, or by constructing the regional permeability from the well-scale permeabilities. Using 

the two well-scale permeabilities from the simple model of 1 and 5 mm fractures, the karstic zone in 

the center of the pumping area can be modeled as a layered aquifer averaging the flow with the result 

being similar to the larger value. When the lower value is utilized near the southwest portion of the 

aquifer, this would be flow across the layers, resulting in a value similar to the lower value. With 

reasonable approximations for karstic and non-karstic zones, this again results in a regional 

permeability of 10
-11

 m
2
.

Fig. 6. Permeability scale effects in the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer (red line) in comparison with other 
carbonate scale effect studies and with permeability ranges for various lithologies (Heath 1983). The 
scale effect of the study area presents an increase of hydraulic conductivities from small- to well-scale 
and a decrease of these values from well- to regional-scale, having similar behavior with the 
compilation of crystalline rocks scale effects (Clauser 1992 - grey line). In the case of Edwards aquifer 
scale effect line (Cretaceous limestones and dolomites from San Antonio segment, Halihan et al. 2000 
- black line) and the Jura Mountains scale effect line (Mesozoic fractured and karstic limestone 
aquifers, Király 1975 - dashed grey line) significant increases in permeabilities across scales are 
observed.  
 

5. Discussion 

 

A schematic scale effect conceptual model block diagram for Sete Lagoas karst aquifer was 

made (Fig. 7) to show how a simple model of hydraulic feature size affects each scale, considering 

permeabilities measured and the inverted hydraulic feature size. The changes in permeability (k) or 

associated hydraulic values (K, and T), the respective size permeable features from small- to well-

scale, and a decrease of these values in some areas from well- to regional-scale were quantitatively 

observed for the aquifer, both through the inversion of field measurements and the forward modeling 

of a simple conceptual model with a single fracture of both karstic and non-karstic settings.  

The porosity and permeability, as well as the aperture of the fractures in the matrix are very low. 

Thus, the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix is much lower than the hydraulic conductivity of the 

bedding planes intercepted at the well-scale. Increases between four and six orders of magnitude in 

the parameters from small- to well-scale were observed. However, from well- to regional-scale, the 

increase did not continue, having a small decrease in the values (Figs. 6 and 7). The same behavior in 

the empirical size permeable features was observed, where values of hydraulic aperture of 0.01 - 0.1 

?m (small-scale) are increasing to 2 - 13 mm (well-scale) and decreasing to 2 - 6 mm (regional-scale). 

These inverted hydraulic sizes are significantly smaller than outcrop fracture or conduit sizes 

consistent with previous investigations based on connectivity and fracture variability.  



Chapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  

Doctoral Thesis 88 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

These quantitative relationships between feature size and hydraulic properties showed that, 

unlike other karst areas have increases in permeability in scale effects from small- to regional-scale, 

such as Edwards Aquifer located in the United States (Halihan et al., 2000) and Juras Mountain in 

Switzerland (Király, 1975), this behavior does not happen in Sete Lagoas karst aquifer in Brazil (Fig. 

6). The relationships are in accordance with Clauser (1992) results, where permeabilities increase 

from small- to well-scale, but from well- to regional-scale they do not continue. The difference is that 

the effects that Clauser (1992) observed happened in crystalline rock (Fig. 6). According to Király 

(1975) and Halihan et al. (2000), increase from small- to the well-scale are caused by fractures being 

incorporated into the well-scale measurements of permeability, and the largest permeabilities on the 

regional-scale were caused by karstic conduits being incorporated. This increase can obtain nine 

orders of magnitude variability (Halihan et al., 2000) (see Edwards aquifer scale effect line on Fig. 6). 

This can be interpreted that the scale effect and dependency in karst aquifers is more related to 

fracture and conduit connectivity.  

In the study area, based on the geologic mapping and optical well logs data (Galvão et al., 

2015), the sub-horizontal solutionally enlarged bedding planes have the primary role in providing 

aquifer transmissivity. All the wells are intercepting sub-horizontal bedding plane discontinuities, 

extracting groundwater from the Neoproterozoic Sete Lagoas karst aquifer dominantly from the main 

two continuous bedding planes, which are more solutionally enlarged in the central area and less 

karstic to the northeast (Figs. 2 and 7). Thus, in the case of a low matrix permeability in a karst aquifer 

in which is governed by bedding planes and low sub-vertical fractures, the chance to have a 

considerable increase in the scale effect from well- to regional-scale is considered low. Both in well- 

and regional-scale, in this case, the largest permeabilities occur due to the same karstic solutionally 

enlarged bedding planes. This interpretation is in accordance with Singhal and Gupta (2010), where 

carbonate rocks of Paleozoic and Mesozoic ages, which are well cemented and recrystallized, often 

have water flow primarily through conduits and fractures. The physical reality is that the flow through 

these planar features may be best modeled as conduits instead of fractures, but the quantitative 

variability does not alter the result. 

At the well-scale, there is variation between low and high values of transmissivity and hydraulic 

conductivity. The central area, located within a graben area and with more karstification, has the 

greatest permeabilities values, including the zero drawdown well pumping test. These solutionally 

enlarged bedding planes are the most important structural features in the Neoproterozoic limestones 

from the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer, providing pathways for groundwater flow and great storage 

capacity. In the northeast portion of the area, smaller values of transmissivity are more common, 

suggesting less karstic bedding planes (confirmed by lithologic well logs, by Galvão et al., 2015). The 

depth of these limestones and its lithologic contacts could explain these different degrees of 

karstification. According to Ford and Williams (2007), transmissivity values, and consequently 

hydraulic conductivity and permeability, can be expected to vary according to vertical position in karst 

rock. In most cases, it will be highest in the most weathered zone of limestone near the surface 

(epikarst) and usually diminishes exponentially with depth.  

Regarding the zero drawdown aquifer test, located in the central urbanized area, some 

researchers believe that these tests are unusable or useless, while others affirming that permeability

may be at some "practical infinity" or simple testing limit for aquifer testing methodologies (Rovey, 

1994; Halihan et al., 2000). The limitation of aquifer tests to predict permeabilities was examined using 

the Thiem equation, for steady-state flow in a confined aquifer, estimating the highest local 

permeabilities values caused by the solutionally enlarged bedding planes. 

At the regional-scale, a capture zone with dimensions of 8 km by 8.5 km (68 km
2
), caused by 

the high pumping rate in wells estimated in 75,000 m
3
/d (Fig. 5) was present. The permeability at the 

regional-scale has a little decrease of these values compared to well-scale (Fig. 6), which means that, 

at the regional-scale, the groundwater is also governed by the same karstic conduits observed at the 

well-scale, but the value is decreased by incorporating non-karstic areas in the regionally averaged 

value. If a groundwater model was generated at the regional-scale with grid dimensions below a 

kilometer, it would be expected that higher permeabilities than generated using the capture zone 

analysis may be required to simulate the system with lower adjacent values to represent non-karstic 

areas. This would modify the permeability scale effect database to indicate a leveling off of values 

between well- and regional-scales instead of a decrease in permeability. 

The implications of this analysis are that an increase of measurement scale does not always 

imply an increase of permeability in these settings, because it will depend of the type of lithology and 

the connectivity of high permeability features. In the case of the study area, the scale effect had a 

reduction of the permeability values, due to the localized development of karst bedding plane 

dissolution in one structurally controlled region of the aquifer. Another implication is that 

measurements can be applied at different scales if the connectivity and structure is well understood to 

develop a robust quantitative model of the hydraulic structure of the aquifer. One limitation is that 

transport should not be calculated at a given scale using continuum approximations, as they will 

underestimate transport times by averaging low permeabilities with high permeability values. A second 

limitation is the need to consider whether turbulent effects are important for estimating permeability or 

the hydraulic size of a feature supplying flow. 

Compared to other regions of the world, a single quantitative model of permeability scale effects 

can be elucidated from this and other associated studies. Aquifers are composed of a range of 

hydraulically connected permeable features. As these systems are sampled, the features sizes and 

connections vary depending on the choice of measurement method. Determining a strong evidence-

based conceptual model of what features control permeability allows us to make prediction about 

quantitative values of permeability expected at various scales. Matrix permeability is often small in 

these systems, but should not be assumed to be neglected. A number of young carbonate systems 

have significant permeability in the matrix of the system. Well-scale permeability is expected to vary 

significantly in most cases as fracture aperture distribution may be strongly variable as in the Edwards 

aquifer of Texas (Halihan, 2000), or the aperture of single horizontal fractures can also be highly 

variable as they are sampled spatially (this study; Muldoon et al., 2001). On a regional-scale, 

understanding of potentially connected conduits is important for many karst aquifers, but this study 

illustrates that conduit permeability may not be a strong regional effect if large conduits are not well 

connected on the scale of measurement. For this aquifer, a smaller grid size regional model would 

likely observe some high permeability grid blocks in the central aquifer, but these values would be well 

supported by the conceptual model built from aquifer testing and optical logging of the system.

6. Conclusion 

 

Unlike other karst areas that have increases in permeability from small- to regional-scale, such 

as Edwards Aquifer located in the United States (Halihan et al., 2000) and Juras Mountain in 

Switzerland (Király, 1975), this behavior does not happen in Sete Lagoas karst aquifer, in Brazil. In 

this area, an increase of about four to six orders of magnitude in the permeabilities from small- to well-

scale is common, but from well- to regional-scale, the value decreases.  



Chapter 7: The karst permeability scale effect of Sete Lagoas  

Doctoral Thesis 91 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

 At the well-scale, the highest permeability wells are concentrated in the central area and close 

to the Santa Helena Ridge foothills, within the graben area, and in the East portion of the study area, 

with decreases occurring to northeast direction. These data coincide with the thickness of the karst 

bedding planes, suggesting a direct relationship between solutionally enlarged bedding planes 

thickness and formation permeability. However, the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer has some zones of high 

karstification, which the standard aquifer test used is an insufficient method for estimation, evidenced 

by zero drawdown, illustrating the limits of aquifer tests. These zones are located specifically in the 

central portion of the urbanized area. Non-Darcian flow likely occurs in these wells. At the regional-

scale, in the central portion of the study area, there is a potentiometric flow convergence, setup by a 

cone of depression and high pumping rate in wells, being recognized as a capture zone. 

The results indicate that multi-scale evaluation using different approaches is useful to develop a 

quantitative hydrogeological conceptual model in karst aquifers, consistent across scales of 

measurement, from small- to regional-scale flow. These methodologies used obtained results 

suggesting that in Neoproterozoic karst aquifers with negligible permeability of the matrix, governed by 

bedding planes discontinuities, would not have increases in permeability from well- to regional-scale, 

unless a zone of more significant karstification occurred on that scale.

Abstract  

 

The study area is the city of Sete Lagoas, located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, which is 

currently supplied by groundwater from karst aquifers. Identifying the various sources and areas of 

recharge in this karst area, its flowpaths, and surface-ground water interaction is important for proper 

water resource management, avoiding eventual contaminations and other future problems. The main 

goal is to determine, by stable isotopes 
18

O and 
2
H and major ions measurements, the identification of 

hydrogeologic processes, surface-ground water connections, possible recharge zones and its 

flowpaths. The majority of the groundwater samples were collected in this urban karst aquifer, while 

the superficial waters were collected in seven main lakes. The stable isotopes results indicated that 

the origin of groundwaters is directly from precipitation, having a limited period of recharge. In the 

central urbanized area, where the karst aquifer is in contact with Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments, 

it could have punctual superficial water infiltration. The major ions presented the highest values at the 

same region, where the most karstic area from the Sete Lagoas Formation is located. These data 

could suggest higher water reservoir indicating more mineralization, which are in concordance with the 

geologic information.  

 

Keywords: Stable isotopes, geochemistry, hydrogeology, groundwater, Brazil. 

 

1. Introduction 

 

A better understanding of hydrological processes and the hydrochemical evolution is very 

important for regional water resources development and management in karst region, where a unique 

and complex flow system exists because of special rock-water reactions (Han et al. 2014). Due to 

groundwater storage and flowpath in karst aquifers are extremely heterogeneous, it is often difficult to 

describe and quantify the flow characteristics with traditional methods. These features also reflect in 

the type of recharge, where are often characterized by high vertical permeabilities due to vertical 

conduits and sinkholes allowing rapid recharge of the groundwater (Ford and Williams 1989, Hess et 

al. 1989) as well as, in some cases, are also connected to surface-water interaction making 

groundwater highly susceptible to contamination (Ryan and Meiman 1996).

Generally, a karst aquifer is a result of a karstification by chemical, and sometimes, mechanical 

actions of water in lands composed by soluble rocks such as limestone, dolomite, or gypsum 

bedrocks, in which the flowpath of the groundwater is closely related to the degree of the karst 

development (Palmer 1991). This development is characterized by the dominance of chemical 

weathering in the surface and subsurface. When the acidic water, as result of rainwater passing 

through the atmosphere, or in the ground/soil picking up carbon dioxide (CO2), starts to break down 

the surface of soluble bedrock near its cracks, or bedding planes (Ford and Williams 1989). As time 

goes on, these fractures will become wider, and eventually, a drainage system of some sort may start 

to form underneath.  

These processes can result in many different groundwater transmission and storage conditions. 

Some display strictly in single porosity, either as matrix only (common in young reefal and eolian 

limestones), or as fissure only (e.g. incipient karst in marble). Large volumes of most karst aquifers will 

display at least dual porosity, exhibiting matrix plus fissure, matrix plus conduit or fissure plus conduit, 

or can have a true triple porosity (matrix-fissure-conduit) recognized in some portions of most large 

explored caves (Ford 1999). 

There are different categories for karst recharge areas. If the karst area recharges itself, it is 

called autogenic recharge. Allogenic recharge occurs when the adjacent non-karst areas recharge the 

karst aquifer. The presence of sinkholes gives a distinct recharge feature, which can be separated into 

point (shaft and conduit dominated), and diffuse (matrix, meso-pore, and macro-pore dominated) 

infiltration and recharge. These areas are the major flowpath for contaminants (Goldsheider and Drew 

2007, Karamouz et al. 2011). 

Identifying the various sources and areas of recharge in karst systems, its flowpaths, and the 

surface-ground water interaction is important for proper water resource management. Many 

researchers have focused to understand these mechanisms using different tools, such as 

hydrogeochemistry, geomorphologic structure, hydrologic dynamics of karst flow, as well as estimating 

the mean rate and spatial distribution of the recharge areas (Andreo et al. 2008, Farfán et al. 2009, Liu 

et al. 2009, Li et al. 2010, Zhao et al. 2010). Other techniques including dye tracers, salts, smoke and 

gaseous tracers and stable isotopes are also used (Käss et al. 1998, Ginsberg and Palmer 2002, 

Karamouz et al. 2011).  

Among these, the stable isotopes of 
18

O and 
2
H have been used in numerous hydrogeologic 

investigations combining with geochemistry data. Some examples can be cited: storm hydrograph 

separation (Kennedy et al. 1986, Buttle 1994, Harris et al. 1995, Machavaram et al. 2006), surface-

ground water interactions (Fontes 1980, McKenna et al. 1992, Coplen and Kendall 2000, O'Driscoll et 

al. 2005, Lee and Kim 2007), or geochemical variations and origins of dryland and salinity (Winston 

and Criss 2003, Cartwright et al. 2004). This method also has been successful in identifying the 

contribution of surface water to groundwater in karst environment (Katz 1995, Meyers et al. 1993, 

Plummer et al. 1998). 

While the use of stable isotopes in hydrogeology started in the 50s, with the pioneering works of 

Urey et al. and Epstein and Mayeda (in Clark and Fritz 1997), in Brazil, the first hydrogeological 

studies using this method started in the late 60s and early 70s in the northeast, southeast and 

Amazon regions (Silveira and Silva Junior 2002). However, due to karst areas in Brazil are not so

extensive in comparison to other regions in the world, such as USA, Europe and Asia, the use of this 

technique to identify the various sources and areas of recharge in karst aquifers is still incipient.  

In regards to this paper, the primary goal was to determine, by 
18

O and 
2
H isotopes and major 

ions measurements, the hydrogeologic flow processes in Sete Lagoas’ aquifers, in order to 

understand possible origin and mechanisms of groundwater recharge and its flowpaths. In this city, the 

current water supplies is almost entirely groundwater from the karst aquifer (Pessoa 1996) and this 

understanding is important to promote aquifer protection against problems related to intensive 

exploitation and water contamination. The majority of the water samples were collected from lakes and 

groundwater wells, between August 2011 and June 2013 for stable isotopic and geochemistry 

analyzes. 

 

2. Site description 

 

The study area is the city of Sete Lagoas, located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, 70 km 

northwest of Belo Horizonte, the state capital (Fig. 1). This city has a population greater than 200,000, 

over an area of 538 km
2
 (IBGE 2010). The greatest population density is located in the central, west-

central and north-central areas of the city, corresponding to the older areas of occupation. There is a 

considerable industrial, mineral and metallurgical center located mainly along the main federal 

highway, which is a corridor of significant growth. The current water supply is almost entirely 

groundwater from the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer (Pessoa 1996), pumping by private and public wells, 

which in the case of the last one, is managed by the Water Supply and Sewage Service (SAAE) 

[SAAE - Serviço de Abastecimento de Água e Esgoto].  

Geologically, the area is located in the São Francisco Craton, where carbonate argillo-

arenaceous sediments are emplaced giving origin to the Bambuí Group (Branco and Costa 1961, 

Oliveira 1967, Schöll and Fogaça 1973, Dardene 1978, Schobbenhaus 1984, Ribeiro et al. 2003, 

Tuller et al. 2010, Galvão et al. in press). The hydrostratigraphic relationships for the Sete Lagoas 

karst aquifer and spatial distribution are given in Pessoa (1996) and Galvão et al. (2015).  

The Sete Lagoas karst aquifer consists of Neoproterozoic limestones, in which the primary 

porosity and matrix permeability can be considered very low (Moore 1989) and the second porosity 

(micro-fractures) is mostly filled by calcite (Tonietto 2010, Galvão et al. 2015). Thus, the majority of the 

fluids migrate through dissolution features characterized as tertiary porosity, in conduits. According to 

Galvão et al. (2015), results from geologic mapping and optical well logging suggest that the 

urbanized area of Sete Lagoas is primarily located in a graben, filled with limestones from the Sete 

Lagoas Formation, Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments, and occasional competent rocks from the 

Serra de Santa Helena Formation (slate, marble, siltstone and argillite). This setting results in barrier 

boundaries for groundwater, which together with natural karst processes, explains the location of two 

main solutionally enlarged bedding planes with large groundwater storage capacity: (1) a shallower 

and thicker continuous dissolution zone with conduits that are 1-8 m thick, near the contact with 

unconsolidated sediments; and (2) 10-20 m below, a thinner continuous dissolution zone with conduits 

that are 20 cm to 1 m thick. These limestones dip and become thicker and completely covered by 



Chapter 8: Stable isotopes and geochemical studies to evaluate flowpaths and recharge areas   

 

Doctoral Thesis 100 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

rocks from the Serra de Santa Helena Formation to the northeast, reaching about 160 m thickness, 

where the two bedding plane conduits become thinner to the northeast (Galvão et al. 2015).  

Geomorphologically, the area is in a karst setting, which provides the presence of lakes, located 

mainly in the central area, some caves, close drainage basin, and sinkholes located in a limestone 

outcrops context (Pessoa 1996) (Fig. 1). Areas that have denser drainage are related to the Santa 

Helena Ridge foothills in the center, basement outcrops in the south, and metasediments in the north. 

The elevation of the area ranges from around 750 to 1000 m, declining from southwest to northeast, 

where the highest elevations are located in the Santa Helena Ridge.  

Regarding the climate, the mean total monthly precipitation is 106 mm, while the total annual is 

1271.8 mm. The rainy season occurs from October to March, with total rainfall of 1132 mm, 

corresponding to 89% of annual precipitation. The period with less precipitation occurs from April to 

September, with 139 mm. The average annual temperature is 20.9 ºC, which July has the lowest 

monthly mean value (17.5 °C), and February the highest one (22.9 °C). The annual variation is around 

5 °C. According to Pessoa (1996), the water balance of Sete Lagoas is divided, monthly, in: 1) water 

excess from January to March; 2) water deficit from April to September; and 3) water replacement 

between October and December, period of groundwater recharging.  

 

3. Methods 

 

To obtain information about groundwater and superficial water to better understand the above 

described hydrogeological setting and its interconnections, 30 supply wells, and 7 lakes sampling 

surveys were conducted during August 2011 and August 2013, collecting data of in-situ 

physicochemical parameters and carrying out chemical analyses of major ions and stable isotopes. 

These methods will be presented sequentially followed by the approach to data integration. 

 

3.1 Stable isotopes 

 

Groundwater samples were taken during August 2011 and November 2012 in 30 SAAE's public 

wells (Table 1 and Fig. 1) used to supply Sete Lagoas (25 samples from Sete Lagoas karst aquifer 

and 5 samples from the basement). In the case of the karst aquifer, according to Galvão et al. (2015), 

the wells located in the central area are pumping waters from the two main solutionally enlarged 

bedding planes, corresponding to the majority of the wells analyzed. These samples were taken after 

removing several well volumes of water, using pumps installed in these wells. This was done to purge 

the aquifer of stagnant water and to acquire fresh aquifer samples for analysis. After sampling, were 

measured physicochemical parameters (pH, temperature - T, electrical conductivity - EC, and 

oxidation-reduction potential - ORP) using the HI 9828 portable multiparameter meter.

(interpreted from georeferenced images, including aerial photography and Landsat imagery), and karst 
features location (caves and sinkholes) (modified from Galvão et al. 2015). The figure also shows the 
location of sampling points, such as groundwater in supply wells (yellow dots), rainwater collector 
(central black rectangle, next to José Felix lake), and surface water in seven lakes (orange star). 
 

The surface water samples were collected only in June 2013, in seven lakes: Brejão, Grande, 

José Felix, Paulino, Pedras, Piranhas, and Fazenda da Morada (Table 1 and Fig. 1). For this, samples 

were taken in the center of each lake using a peristaltic pump (brand Geopump). This method followed 

the low flow principle, avoiding sediment from the lake's substrate (Puls and Barcelona 1996).  

Eleven cumulative monthly rain isotope samples were also collected representing a hydrological 

year, from April 2012 to April 2013 (no samples in July 2012 due to lack of rain). For this, a 

polypropylene bottle (10 L) with an also polypropylene funnel connected in that bottle were used and 

placed in a cooler to keep the temperature and prevent sunlight penetration. A silicone hose with 6 m 

long was also attached on the bottle to balance the pressure and prevent exchanges with atmospheric 

air. This method followed the GNIP (Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation) instruction, where 

evaporation and loss of lighter isotopes are negligible (IAEA/WMO 2004). 

The main concern with these samples was to avoid the post-sampling fractionation. For this, 

pre-cleaned polypropylene vials (30 ml) were used. These vials were completely filled with samples, 

avoiding air bubbles inside and stored in coolers maintaining the temperature. All samples were

analyzed for 
18

O and 
2
H at the Groundwater Research Center (CEPAS) [CEPAS - Centro de 

Pesquisas de Águas Subterrâneas], Institute of Geosciences, University of São Paulo. The samples 

were run on PICARRO L2130i, processed by Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) for 

Lasers software, and were normalized to internal laboratory water standards that were previously 

calibrated relative to the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW). The results were expressed 

as ?

O and ?

H, where ?sample (‰) = ((Rsample /Rstandard) ? 1) × 1000, where R is D/H, 

18
O/

16
O. The 

analytical precisions were ±0.09‰ for ?
 18

O and ±0.9‰ for ?

H. 

After all these analysis, all the samples were compared with the latest Global Meteoric Water 

Line (GMWL) reported by Rozanski et al. (1993). This meteoric water line is linearly related by the 

equation ?

H = 8.17 ?

18
O + 11.27, and it is an enhancement to the first meteoric water line proposed 

by Craig (1961), related by the equation ?

H = 8 ?

18
O + 10. This high correlation coefficient reflects the 

fact that the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes in water molecules are intimately associated. 

 

3.2 Geochemistry analysis 

 

The same supply wells used to collect groundwater samples for isotopic analysis were also 

used for geochemistry analysis (Table 2). Samples for major cations (Na

), major 

anions (HCO

3), total dissolved solids (TDS), and total water hardness (WH) 

were collected in pre-cleaned 1 L plastic polyethylene bottles, and then, stored in coolers at 4°C, 

according to the Brazilian Sampling and Water Preservation Guide (CETESB 1998). For some 

analyses, samples were filtered through a 0.45 ?m filter, while for major cations were acidified with 

nitric acid to a pH of less than 2. All these samples were analyzed at the Analytical Solution 

Company's laboratory, in São Paulo. 

After that, all the measurements were checked for accuracy by calculating the mass balance, 

and then the water types were classified using the Piper's diagram of water (Piper 1944) using the 

AquaChem 4.0 software (Fig. 6). In order to help understand the spatial concentrations of each 

parameter, kriging interpolations of the data were carried out using the Surfer 8 software to drawn 

isopleth maps. 

Finally, all the data sets were entered in a GIS database and georeferenced in the ArcGIS 10.1 

software. The coordinate system was Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection, Zone 23, 

datum SAD 69, with units in meters. 

 

4. Results 

 

The results will be presented sequentially from the stable isotope analysis for rainwater, 

superficial water and groundwater, and finally the geochemistry results, for groundwater.  

 

4.1 Stable isotopes 

 

The groundwater stable isotopic composition was little variable, not reflecting significant 

difference signatures through one year. The ?
18

O values varied from -5.26 to -7.31‰, with a mean of -

6.45‰, while ?
2
H values varied from -37.6 to -47.0‰, with a mean of -42.5‰. The deuterium excess 

values ranged from 6.78 to 11.48‰, with a mean of 9.08‰ (Table 1). The mean isotopic compositions 

of the groundwater fell in the GMWL, with mostly samples on or near the GMWL, while others plotted 

fairly tightly in the lower right, where the best-fit linear regression line had a slope of 4.80 and an 

interception of -11.53. Both waters from Sete Lagoas karst aquifer and basement are mostly located at 

the same region on the graphic, clustered, with no discernible spatial trend (Fig. 2). 

The ?
18

O and ?
2
H values from the seven lakes collected were well variable (Table 1). When 

?
18

O is plotted against ?
2
H (Fig. 2), the mean isotopic compositions of the lake water fell well to the 

right of the global meteoric water line along a best-fit linear regression line with a slope of 5.13 and an 

interception of -9.04. Even both groundwater and lake water had some similarities in their linear 

regressions, with slopes values around 5 and negative interceptions around 10, the distribution of ?
18

O 

and ?
2
H values through the meteoric water line were not similar, where the groundwaters presented 

more negative values.  

The ?
18

O values of rainfall varied from 2.93 to -5.62‰, mostly being negative. Rainwater ?
2
H 

values varied from 25.8 to -36.5‰. Deuterium excess values ranged from 2.36 to 13.82‰ with a mean 

of 11.72‰. The result shows that mostly rainwater samples fell along the GMWL (Fig. 2), where some 

deviations of highest rainwater values can be attributed to atmospheric-evaporative effects during the 

sampling. Due to this effects, probably caused by a problem in the rain collector in some isolated 

months, as well as an insufficient data of rain to build a consistent local meteoric water line (only 11 

samples, because in July there was no rain enough for sampling), the samples was just compared 

with the GMWL together with the groundwater and lake samples.

4.2 Geochemistry 

 

The physical parameters and chemical compositions of waters in Sete Lagoas are given in the 

Table 2. The values of pH ranged from 6.1 to 8.1 with a mean value of 7.1, and EC ranged from 69 to 

590 ?S/cm, with a mean value of 322 ?S/cm. The T ranged between 21.8 and 25.5ºC and mean value 

of 23.2 ºC, while ORP from 74 to 329 mV, with a mean value of 134 mV. While pH and EC had the 

highest values in the central portion, within the graben area, data for T and ORP did not present the 

same pattern (Fig. 3). 

Regarding the major ions, Na
+
 and Ca

2+
 together accounted for 75–99% of total cations (except 

in some wells located around the basement - PT-78, 81, 86, 87, and 89, between 43–66%, and in the 

Santa Helena Ridge foothills - PT-105, around 26%). HCO
?

3 was the most abundant anion in the 

waters, while SO
2?

4 was the second most abundant one. On the other hand, the anion CO
-2

3 almost 

did not occur (only observed in the PT-69). All these highest values, as well as the high values in the 

rest of the cations and anions are essentially located in the central portion of the area, within the 

graben area in the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer (Figs. 4 and 5). The spatial distribution of major ion 

concentrations is consistent, coinciding with the pH and EC, TDS and WH concentrations (Fig. 3). 

According to Custodio and Llamas (2001), the classification of hardness as CaCO3, in mg/L, is: 

&amp;lt;50 (soft), 50-100 (moderately hard), 100-200 (hard), and &gt; 200 (very hard). 56% of the water 

hardness results presented values between 100 and 200 mg/L classified as hard waters, 26% 

between 50 and 100 mg/L, classified as moderately waters, and 13% with a content below 50 mg/L. 

The supply well PT-51 exceeded 200 mg/L classified as very hard, while PT-105 did not presented 

hardness (Fig. 3). 

According to the Piper's diagram (Fig. 6), the majority of the sampled waters, 50%, were 

classified as of Ca
2+

?HCO
-
3 type, fitting with those classified by Pessoa (1996). The second most 

common water type was Ca
2+

?Na
+
?HCO

-
3, about 23% of the samples, while 10% of the waters were 

classified as of Ca
2+

?Na
+
?HCO

-
3 type, and 7% as of Ca

2+
?Mg

2+
?Na

?HCO

3 type (Appelo and Postma 

2005). The rest of the sampled water, 10%, were classified as of Na
+
?Ca

2+
?Mg

2+
?HCO

3, 

Mg
2+

?Na
+
?HCO

-

?HCO

3, being noted in individual sampled wells (Fig. 6). In some cases, 

waters near the basement outcrops or located in had more pronounced Mg
2+

 and Na
+
+ K in their 

compositions. In the case of waters relatively far from the basement, generally, were more enriched in 

Ca
2+

 and Na
+
, associated to limestones from the Sete Lagoas Formation. However, the presence of 

bicarbonate ions (HCO
-
3) in all cases is predominant. Waters from the basement (PT-78, 81, 86, 87 

and 89) had enrichment of Mg
2+

, as well as close to the Santa Helena Ridge (PT-105). Some samples 

with nitrate (PT-12, 18, 19, 22) indicated different behavior, being not clustered with the rest of the 

samples, which means that this water probably had some alteration on their natural compositions.

(right), it is possible to see the location of each one type of water. Waters near the basement outcrops 
or located in had more pronounced Mg

2+
 and Na

+
+ K on their compositions. In the case of waters 

relatively far from the basement, they are more enriched in Ca
2+

 and Na
+
, associated to limestones 

from the Sete Lagoas Formation. The presence of bicarbonate ions (HCO
-
3) in all cases is 

predominant. Waters in the basement (PT-78, 81, 86, 87 and 89) had a little enrichment of Mg
2+

, as 
well as close to the Santa Helena Ridge (PT-105). Some samples exceeding 10 mg/L can indicate 
different behavior, being not clustered with the rest of the samples, probably having any alteration on 
their natural composition. 
 

5. Discussion 

 

The discussion will be presented sequentially from the stable isotope and geochemistry 

interpretations, to the water evolution and sources of recharge, presenting a schematic conceptual 

model of Sete Lagoas. 

 

5.1 Stable isotopes 

 

The lake waters from Sete Lagoas have the highest values of ?
2
H and ?

18
O, falling well below 

the global meteoric water line, forming an evaporation line, an indication that these waters are 

exposed to a high degree of evaporation (Fig. 2). It is important to relativize that these lake waters 

were collected during the dry season, in June, where the evaporation rate is high, reflecting the 

location of these points in the graphic.  



Chapter 8: Stable isotopes and geochemical studies to evaluate flowpaths and recharge areas   

 

Doctoral Thesis 111 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

The groundwater samples, both from karst aquifer and basement, which were collected during 

dry and rainy seasons, have mostly samples clustered, with the majority of them on or near the 

GMWL, indicating recharging directly from precipitation. Other samples were plotted fairly tightly in the 

lower left, which give an appearance of evaporation. Regarding the clustering of groundwater 

samples, it could suggest a limited period of recharge, according to Clark and Fritz (2007), where the 

rainy season in Sete Lagoas occurs from October to March, corresponding to 89% of annual 

precipitation (Fig. 2), having October, November and December as being the recharging period, 

according to the water balance proposed by Pessoa (1996). 

In the case of groundwater samples plotted in the lower left, this situation could suggest that, in 

some situations, groundwater locally could receive superficial water contributions. Some pumping 

wells, which the groundwater samples were collected, are located next to some lakes, e.g. PT-71 

(Brejão Lake), PT-75, 77 (Grande Lake and Piranhas Lake). Other wells also have evidences of little 

evaporation and are located or close to some lakes (José Felix Lake and Paulino Lake) or close to 

drainages and in the Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments. The groundwaters in Sete Lagoas are 

stored in two main solutionally enlarged bedding planes, where in the central portion of the area are 

covered by these unconsolidated sediments (Galvão et al. 2015). In this region, groundwater could 

have punctual superficial water contributions (from lakes or small drainage, Fig. 1), reflecting in the 

plotting of some dots in the lower left of the GMWL, forming this evaporation pattern.  

Thus, the overall evidences could suggest that the groundwaters in Sete Lagoas: (1) are 

recharged directly from precipitation; (2) have a limited period of recharge during the recharging 

season, from October to December; and (3) in the central portion, where the karst aquifer is in contact 

with Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments, could have superficial water infiltration. 

 

5.2 Geochemistry 

 

The major ions presented the highest values at the same region, where the most karst area 

from the Sete Lagoas Formation is located, within the graben area, coinciding with the pH, EC, TDS 

and WH values, which present the same concentration behavior (Figs. 3 to 5). These data could 

suggest a large water reservoir indicating more mineralization, which are in concordance with the 

geologic information commented by Galvão et al. (2015). This area is primarily located in a graben, 

filled with a deposit of limestones resulting in barrier boundaries for groundwater, which together with 

natural karst processes explain the location of two main solutionally enlarged bedding planes with 

large groundwater storage capacity.  

The water hardness, which refers to the ability of water to form encrustations, prevent the 

sudsing of soap, is due the presence of calcium and magnesium cations, forming insoluble 

compounds. Hard water contributes to inefficient and costly operation of water-using appliances. Pipes 

can become clogged with encrustations that reduces water flow and ultimately requires pipe 

replacement. This can pose serious problems in industrial settings, as well as in domestic purposes, 

when hardness is above 100 mg/L. The highest values were found in the central urbanized area, 

which the population living in this area can have problems related of encrustations. Indeed, according 

to fieldwork investigations and interviews with local residents, these problems are common. 



Chapter 8: Stable isotopes and geochemical studies to evaluate flowpaths and recharge areas   

 

Doctoral Thesis 112 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

The presence of a high value of Mg
2+

 ion in the central area (23.97 mg/L) compared to the 

remaining areas could indicate localized dolomite occurrences or dolomitic limestones, enriching some 

water compositions. These ions also could indicate water residence time because of its low dissolution 

kinetic (Mudry 1987, Plagnes 1997, Batiot et al. 2003). Commonly, the more severe the low flow 

conditions, the more mobilized becomes the water, with increased residence time (Fig. 4).  

Nitrate (as NO
-
3) occurs in almost all natural water, except when contamination is present, when 

they seldom exceed 20 mg/L (Hounslow 1995). However, 10 mg/L or greater may be regarded as a 

probable indication of contamination (e.g. from fertilizer, municipal wastewaters, septic systems, etc.). 

In the central portion of the urbanized area, values over 10 mg/L (PT-01: 10.34 mg/L; PT-15: 17.55 

mg/L; PT-17: 17.00 m/L) and even greater than 20 mg/L (PT-12: 37.5 mg/L) were found. According to 

Foster and Hirata (1987), inefficient management of domestic sewage in-situ sanitation systems is the 

main source of nitrate in urbanized areas, particularly in developing countries. The NO
-
3 is also an 

indication of recent contamination related to construction problems in wells or a lack of aquifer 

protection (Alaburda and Nishihara 1998). As construction problems on these wells with high nitrate 

values were not observed during fieldworks, and the concentrations are located only in the central 

portion of the urban area (Fig. 5), it could be interpreted as a local contamination by superficial 

infiltration probably by domestic sewage or septic tank, which can be considered as an evidence of 

local connections between surface waters and groundwaters, corroborating with the isotopic data.  

Regarding the higher Ca
2+

 concentrations in the central area, is probably due to the reaction of 

calcite with carbon dioxide (CO2) derived from respiration or oxidation of organic matter. In this region, 

is common the presence of Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments right above the limestones (may 

reach up to 40 m thick - Galvão et al. 2015, in press), which could provide carbon dioxide reacting with 

water that infiltrates through these sediments to form carbonic acid (H2CO3). This acid provides 

protons (H
+
), which can associate with the carbonate ion (CO

2-
3) from calcite (CaCO3) to form 

bicarbonate (HCO
-
3), and then take place dissolution and precipitation. It can be seen in the Fig. 6 that 

the concentrations of HCO
-
3 are much higher and located in the whole area, while the CO

2-
3 values is 

only seen in one sampling well, being zero in the rest of the area, indicating the last stage of the 

reaction of the dissolution of calcite. Other evidences are the concentrations of these ions as function 

of pH. The pH values are between &gt; 6.3 and &amp;lt;10, where within this interval HCO
-
3 is the most 

predominant species than CO
2-

3 (Fig. 5). 

Waters tend to precipitate calcite or dolomite when it is oversaturated and tend to dissolve them 

if it is undersaturated. The Saturation Index (SI) is perhaps the most widely used method to determine 

the amount of calcite that will be precipitated or dissolved. The results show that almost all 

groundwaters are undersaturated in dolomite and calcite (Fig. 7). The fact that the waters are 

undersaturated in dolomite and calcite indicates that both elements can dissolve in this system, which 

means that the two main solutionally enlarged bedding planes that the groundwaters are stored and 

are being pumped are still undergoing processes of karstification.  

So, a question can be asked: is this a natural phenomenon or is this event a result of pumping 

through decades? Analyzing the Fig. 8, where there is a comparison between SI and pumping rate, no 

relationship was noted, such as high pumping rates and low values of SI, suggesting a natural 

phenomenon that took place well before the origin of the city and the anthropogenic well pumping.

those parameters was seen, such as high pumping rates and low values of SI, suggesting a natural

5.3 Water evolution and sources of recharge 

 

A schematic water evolution conceptual model of Sete Lagoas was proposed (Fig. 9). 

Generally, the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer consists of Neoproterozoic limestones that has the primary 

porosity and matrix permeability very low and the second porosity (micro-fractures) mostly filled by 

calcite (Galvão et al. 2015). Thus, the majority of fluids migrate through dissolution features 

characterized as tertiary porosity developed in bedding planes (most frequent) and sometimes in 

subvertical fractures (less common), not receiving much contribution from the matrix (Galvão et al. 

2015). In the case of the basement, waters fluid through subvertical fractures.  



Chapter 8: Stable isotopes and geochemical studies to evaluate flowpaths and recharge areas   

 

Doctoral Thesis 114 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

In areas where the limestone outcrops, where some sinkholes and caves are located (Figs. 1 

and 9), can be considered as direct recharge zones (or autogenic recharge), receiving rainfall waters 

by runoff. In some cases, these waters infiltrate through unconsolidated sediments and in the 

basement outcrops until reach the water table in the karst aquifer, being classified as allogenic 

recharge. The autogenic waters infiltrate in the sinkholes and caves located mostly in the south and 

southeast (Fig. 1), with higher elevations and flowing mainly in the two solutionally enlarged bedding 

planes, to the NNE direction, according the potentiometric surface map and its flow directions (Fig. 9). 

Some waters could pass through dolomitic rocks being enriched of magnesium, with increased 

residence time, which could indicate a dissolution zone storing waters for more period of time in that 

particular area.  

Regarding the basement, when it outcrops, there is an autogenic basement recharge, with 

waters infiltrating in subvertical fractures. In some areas, where this basement is covered by other 

formations, there is an allogenic basement recharge, with waters passing through overlaying 

lithologies until reach the basement water table (Fig. 9). Waters from the basement (PT-78, 81, 86, 87 

and 89), as well as close to the Santa Helena Ridge (PT-105) are more enriched in Mg
2+

. They can 

mix with waters more enriched in Ca
2+

 and Na
+
, associated with limestones from the Sete Lagoas 

Formation, and dilute, influencing in their final composition types, seen in some samples located in the 

south (PT-81, 82), west (PT-90), and close to Santa Helena Ridge (PT-34, 47).  

In the central area, waters can also have some mixing with allogenic recharge from 

unconsolidated sediments that can reach the two main conduits. Occurrences of nitrate and isotopic 

evaporations evidence this type of local infiltration and superficial-ground water interconnections, such 

as local drainage and lakes. In the central urbanized area, the presence of the highest values of major 

ions indicates more mineralization in the groundwater, suggesting large groundwater storage capacity. 

According to Galvão et al. (in review), this region has the highest transmissivity values in Sete Lagoas, 

considered other evidence of karstification.

characterized as tertiary porosity developed in bedding planes (most frequent) and sometimes in sub-
vertical fractures (less common). In the case of basement, waters fluid through subvertical fractures.

6. Conclusion 

 

Groundwaters in Sete Lagoas are the result of direct recharge from precipitation, during a 

limited period from October to December. The recharging zones are mainly the sinkholes and caves 

entrances, as well as in areas where the limestones are covered by Cenozoic unconsolidated 

sediments. The majority of the fluids migrate through tertiary porosity, characterized by solutionally 

enlarged bedding planes and less common by sub-vertical enlarged fractures.  

The isotopic data in the lakes reflect evaporation processes, which combining with some 

groundwater samples also with evaporation evidences, indicate some interconnections. Nitrate 

occurences can be interpreted as an evidence of local connections between surface waters and 

groundwaters, corroborating with these isotopic data. Groundwaters from the basement, with the same 

isotopic signature in comparison to water from the karst aquifer also have the same origin, by 

precipitation. 

The majority of these groundwaters are classified as of Ca
2+

?HCO
-
3 type, associated to 

limestones from the Sete Lagoas Formation. Waters in the basement and close to the Santa Helena 

Ridge are enriched of Mg
2+

. These different types of water can mix with waters more enriched in Ca
2+

 

and Na
+
, diluting, resulting in other composition types. These mixing waters also indicate 

interconnections between karst aquifer and basement waters. 

The central urbanized area, where the Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments cover the 

limestones, as well as in areas with sinkholes and cave entrances are located, are considered the 

major flowpaths for contaminants in Sete Lagoas. However, for the sinkhole and cave entrances 

regions, it is recommended directed studies to confirm this consideration. The occurrences of nitrate in 

the central area exceeding 20 mg/L indicate that the stakeholders must protect these areas.

CHAPTER 9: CONCLUSIONS  

 

This section provides the overall conclusions of the most relevant results about 

the karst hydrogeological system of Sete Lagoas. For easy comprehensions, these 

conclusions are separated by subtopics, according to their importance.  

 

9.1 Geological features of Sete Lagoas and surroundings 

 

The city of Sete Lagoas and surroundings are along basement border, a result 

of extensional events in the São Francisco Craton, where silicate-carbonate 

sediments from the Neoproterozoic age were emplaced giving origin to the Bambuí 

Group. Due to the relative proximity of the study area with the Serra do Espinhaço 

(the Serra do Espinhaço is situated to the east of the study area and had undergone 

intense deformation), the Bambuí Group presents a horst and graben system, 

controlled by faulting, displacing the stratigraphic sequences, which enables 

formations with different ages side by side. In the west of the area, the structural 

features were less expressive and the sedimentary features were more preserved.  

Lithologies from the Belo Horizonte Complex basement, the Sete Lagoas 

Formation, the Serra de Santa Helena Formation, and Cenozoic unconsolidated 

sediments occur in the area. The Sete Lagoas and the Serra de Santa Helena 

formations follow the horst and graben system, presenting thinner layers on the basin 

border in the SW region, and higher thickness in the NE area. The limestones from 

the Sete Lagoas Formation dip and become thicker to the northeast, being covered 

almost totally by competent rocks from the Serra de Santa Helena Formation (slate, 

marble, siltstone, and argillite). These limestones arise mainly in the Santa Helena 

Ridge foothills and in the municipalities located to the southeast of the city of Sete 

Lagoas, near the Velhas River. The Serra de Santa Helena Formation is immediately 

over the Sete Lagoas Formation, with abrupt contact. The contacts with basement 

are also abrupt, with sediments deposited in area with little relief. This formation also 

dips and becomes thicker to the NE and thinner on the basin borders and near the 

Velhas River. The thickness of the sedimentary basin layers, in the NE portion of 

Sete Lagoas, is estimated in 400 m, near this river. The limestones from the Sete 

Lagoas Formation present horizontal continuity, from the basement border to the 

Velhas River.  



Chapter 9: Conclusions  

 

Doctoral Thesis 121 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

Within the city of Sete Lagoas, limestones from the Sete Lagoas Formation had 

undergone dissolution process that most strongly affected the bedding planes of 

these rocks, and, in lower magnitude, the sub-vertical fracture planes, forming karst 

conduits. Some of these dissolution zones were filled with terrigenous material. The 

medium-grained Lagoa Santa Member had a higher degree of dissolution (e.g. dry 

caves and grottoes) compared to the fine-grained lower Pedro Leopoldo Member 

(e.g. solutionally enlarged bedding planes). These evidences suggest 

geomorphological processes, such as a past meteoric water flow, or have started at 

the time when groundwater flowpaths started to develop, even if these limestones 

had not yet been exposed. As the timing of these processes is not precisely known, it 

is recommended specific studies to be conducted for a better understanding about 

the origin of these processes.  

The Santa Helena Ridge, in the central portion of the city, was interpreted as a 

horst, which elevated the stratigraphic sequence, causing the Sete Lagoas and the 

Serra de Santa Helena formations to have higher altitudes than in other regions. 

Considering that fracture filled quartz veins cut this stratigraphic sequence, the ridge 

became more resistant to erosion. The Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments 

deposited in the central portion of Sete Lagoas were a result of weathering and 

erosion of Santa Helena Ridge rocks.  

 

9.2 Hydrogeological features of the city of Sete Lagoas 

 

The Sete Lagoas karst aquifer, which is approximately 75 meters thick on 

average, consists of Neoproterozoic limestones, composed of two members: the 

Pedro Leopoldo Member (at the base) and the Lagoa Santa Member (on the top), in 

which the primary porosity and matrix permeability can be considered very low and 

the secondary porosity is mostly filled by the precipitation of calcite. The majority of 

groundwater migrates through dissolution features characterized as tertiary porosity. 

The urbanized area of Sete Lagoas is primarily located in an inferred graben, 

filled with limestones from the Sete Lagoas Formation, with Cenozoic unconsolidated 

sediments, and occasionally covered by competent rocks from the Serra de Santa 

Helena Formation. This setting results in fault bounded barrier boundaries for 

groundwater, which together with natural karst processes, explains the location of 

two dominant solutionally enlarged bedding planes with high permeability and 



Chapter 9: Conclusions  

 

Doctoral Thesis 122 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

significant water storage capacity in the limestones: (1) a shallower and thicker 

continuous dissolution zone with conduits that are 1-8 m thick, near the contact with 

the overlying unconsolidated sediments; and (2) 10-20 m below, a thinner continuous 

dissolution zone with conduits that are 20 cm to 1 m thick. These two bedding plane 

conduits become thinner to the northeast. 

Regarding the permeabilities of the karst aquifer, the solutionally enlarged 

bedding planes have the primary role in providing aquifer transmissivity. Unlike other 

karst areas that have increases in permeability in scale effects from small- to 

regional-scale, this behavior does not happen in the Sete Lagoas karst aquifer. An 

increase of about four to six orders of magnitude in the permeabilities from small- to 

well-scale is common, but from well- to regional-scale, the values decrease, due to 

the localized development of karst bedding plane dissolution in one structurally 

controlled region of the aquifer.  

In small-scale, the mean permeability of the matrix is very low, because it is 

composed of a Neoproterozoic fine-grained (Pedro Leopoldo Member, at the base) 

and a medium-grained (Lagoa Santa Member, on the top) limestone that undergone 

recrystallization, with the secondary porosity (micro-fractures) generally filled by 

calcite. Relative to the bedding plane features, these values can be approximated on 

time scales for pumping or regional flow estimates as zero. 

At the well-scale, the highest permeability features and groundwater storage are 

concentrated in the central urbanized area and close to the Santa Helena Ridge 

foothills, within the graben area, and in the East portion of the study area, with 

decreases occurring to northeast direction. These data coincide with the thickness of 

the karst bedding planes, suggesting a direct relationship between solutionally 

enlarged bedding planes and karst permeabilities. However, the Sete Lagoas karst 

aquifer has some permeability characterized by zones of high karstification and 

storage, which the standard well aquifer test is an insufficient method for estimation, 

evidenced by zero drawdown, illustrating the limits of aquifer tests. Non-Darcian flow 

likely occurs in these wells.  

At the regional-scale, the permeability have a slightly smaller value in 

comparison to the largest well-scale numbers, indicating that conduit permeability 

may not be a strong regional effect if large conduits are not well connected on the 

scale of measurement. Both in well- and regional-scale, the largest permeabilities 

occur due to the same karstic conduits, but at the regional-scale, the permeability 



Chapter 9: Conclusions  

 

Doctoral Thesis 123 Galvão, P.H.F.  

 

values of matrix are more incorporated in the overall regional scale resulting in 

smaller values. Thus, in a low matrix permeability karst aquifer in which is governed 

by bedding planes and low sub-vertical fractures, the chance to have a considerable 

increase in the scale effect from well- to regional-scale is considered low.  

 

9.3 Groundwater evolution and source of recharges  

 

The groundwaters in Sete Lagoas are results of direct recharge from 

precipitation, during a limited period from October to December. The recharging 

zones are mainly the sinkholes and caves entrances, as well as in areas where the 

limestones are covered by Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments. The majority of the 

fluids migrate through the solutionally enlarged bedding planes and less common by 

sub-vertical enlarged fractures. The majority of these groundwaters are classified as 

of Ca
2+

?HCO
-
3 type, associated to limestones from the Sete Lagoas Formation. 

Waters in the basement and close to the Santa Helena Ridge are enriched of Mg
2+

. 

These different types of water can mix with waters more enriched in Ca
2+

 and Na
+
, 

diluting, resulting in other composition types. These mixing waters also indicate 

interconnections between waters from the karst aquifer and the basement.  

In the central urbanized area, where the karst aquifer is in contact with 

Cenozoic unconsolidated sediments, and is more karstified, could have punctual 

superficial water infiltration. Isotopic results evidencing evaporation signatures in both 

lake water and groundwater samples, as well as nitrate in groundwater (in that last 

case, indication of recent contamination by domestic sewage or septic tank), 

corroborating this conclusion. Even in this region, high values of major ions indicating 

water mineralization and, hence, higher groundwater storage capacity, which is in 

concordance with the location of the highest transmissivity values and the most 

karstic dissolution zones. 

 

9.4 Urban groundwater extraction and karst geotechnical risks  

 

In the urbanized area, the combination of unconsolidated sediments overlying 

limestones or simple exposed limestone outcrops with two solutionally enlarged 

bedding planes in subsurface provided a geologic framework for geotechnical issues. 

In that region, there is a cone of depression (dimensions of 8 km by 8.5 km = 68 km
2
) 



Chapter 9: Conclusions

caused by high pumping rates in wells, estimated in 75,000 m
3
/d. During several 

decades, since the first supply well drilled in 1942 until present, some areas had 

significant decreases in the water table, around 40 m lower due to pumping. In some 

points, the shallowest conduit is entirely in the unsaturated zone. Depending on the 

size and depth of the conduit and the thickness of the layers above, subsidence can 

occur causing depressions on the land surface or, in extreme situations, collapse. 

This combination between geologic framework and high groundwater extraction 

explains the emergence of the cluster of induced subsidence or collapse.  

In this area, largely located in the highest geotechnical risk zone, and where the 

majority of the population is living, recommendations include reducing groundwater 

use based on potentiometric surface elevation, prohibition to drilling new wells, 

prioritizing public wells to supply, and switching to surface water supply where 

possible. The main objective is to preserve groundwater resources to reduce the 

localized drawdown, which creates vadose conduits. Supply wells could be relocated 

to more protected areas, outside of that zone, avoiding future collapses.  

 

9.5 General recommendations  

 

This doctoral thesis, from a hydraulic, geotechnical, and geochemical point of 

view, clarified important issues in regional scale, with punctual characterization in 

local scale. The multidisciplinary methodologies integrating geological, 

hydrogeological, geochemical, and isotopes studies that were used to understand the 

water circulation in karst terrain, obtained satisfactory results, giving alternative 

responses for a better use of water. However, specific questions remain without 

answers, being interesting, in scientific terms and of water management, more 

clarified. Researches focusing on water flow system at the two main sollutionally 

enlarged bedding planes located in the urbanized area, where the majority of the 

population lives, are strongly recommended. Possible interconnections between 

these conduits, calculating the hydraulic parameters independently, determining the 

apparent age of the waters separately, and estimating the preferential groundwater 

flowpaths should be evaluated. These studies could contribute in the improvement of 

the hydrogeological conceptual model in more detail, giving clarifications in terms of 

groundwater flowpaths and its storages, contamination vulnerabilities, among others, 

improving the groundwater management.
