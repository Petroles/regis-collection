Theory versus Practice

• In Theory: 

An ideal solution to an important problem.

• In Theory: 

An ideal solution to an important problem.

• In Practice:  

Imperfect adaptations are unavoidable, but 

may jeopardize success.

The “Rule of Capture”… 

… as explained by:



Excerpt from “Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part One), aired May 21, 1995. 



The “Rule of Capture,” as Explained by Law

• The well bore may not cross property lines.

– Mr. Burns is breaking the law.



The “Rule of Capture,” as Explained by Law

• The well bore may not cross property lines.

– Mr. Burns is breaking the law.

• But hydrocarbons may (and will) cross 

property lines.

– Your neighbor’s vertical well is not breaking the 

law.

– Without unitization, your neighbor will drill many 

wells that exploit your property.

How Unitization “Solves” the Problem

• Each producer owns a share of the common 

pie.



How Unitization “Solves” the Problem

• Each producer owns a share of the common 

pie.

• Incentives are aligned; each producer want 

to maximize the value of the pie, which in 

turn maximizes the value of his share.

• Incentives are aligned; each producer want

• Waste that hurts any one producer, hurts all.

receive unanimous support.



Problems That Remain to be Solved

– Bargaining and the inherent bargaining power of 

small interest holders.

Economic Analysis of Bargaining Power

• Simplified model of two owners producing 

from one field.



Economic Analysis of Bargaining Power

• Simplified model of two owners producing 

from one field.

• Voluntary unitization is possible, but only if 

the owners reach mutual agreement on:

– equity shares

– operational plan (well locations, etc.)



Economic Analysis of Bargaining Power

• Simplified model of two owners producing 

from one field.

• Voluntary unitization is possible, but only if 

the owners reach mutual agreement on:

– equity shares

– operational plan (well locations, etc.)

• This situation “favors” the small interest 

holder.

Government Intervention

• Well spacing and permitting regulations 

replace anarchy (in the event of 

disagreement) with order.  This limits the 

bargaining power of smaller interests.

• These may prevent agreement on “terms of 

trade” by which individual holdings are 

exchanged for shares of the unitized field.



How Many “Participating Areas” in the Unit?

• Dual “Participating Areas” are created to help 

owners reach agreement on equity shares.

• Dual “Participating Areas” are created to help 

owners reach agreement on equity shares.

• Common Examples

– “Oil Rim vs. “Gas Cap” participating areas

– “Primary” vs. “Secondary” participating areas

• Intended benefit:  to circumvent conflict over the 

“terms of trade” (by avoiding the trade)

disagreement about the relative value of the 

dissimilar assets (oil vs. gas)



Negative Impact of Dual Participating Areas

• Creates competition among owners.

Negative Impact of Dual Participating Areas

• Creates competition among owners.

• Imposes conflicting perspectives on a shared

• Exposes owners to the “hold up” problem: pressure 

to alter agreements after costs have been sunk and

concentrated in the Gas Cap (gas-prone 

leases). 

If the owners form two PA’s, their interests 

will be misaligned.

Ex. 3:  Divergent Fiscal Regimes ??

• Question:  Can royalty and production-sharing leases be 

combined (voluntarily) into one unit?

• Question:  Can royalty and production-sharing leases be 

combined (voluntarily) into one unit?

• Answer:  It depends; problems arise only if:

two regimes.  (probably not)

– There is uncertainty re: the fiscal burden that each regime 

will impose on affected production streams.  (maybe, if 

variations in future oil prices influence the R-factor)

– That uncertainty fosters disagreement among owners re: 

future fiscal burdens under the two regimes.  (don’t know, 

but this is conceivable)

• In confronting this question, Brazil is on a new frontier in the 

development and adaptation of unitization schemes to an 

imperfect world.
