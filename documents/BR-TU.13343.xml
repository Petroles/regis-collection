Resumo 

 

 

As lesões na cartilagem articular são um grande problema da 

sociedade actual. A engenharia de tecidos da cartilagem é uma 

alternativa emergente aos procedimentos da medicina tradicional, 

produzindo estruturas porosas biomiméticas capazes de mimetizar a 

organização estrutural das fibras de colagénio, dependentes de 

profundidade, da cartilagem articular nativa. O presente trabalho, 

pretendia não só optimizar o tamanho dos poros da estrutura fibrosa 

electrofiada das várias zonas que compõem as estruturas porosas 3D 

anisotrópicas, desenvolvidas anteriormente pelo grupo de investigação 

da equipa de supervisão, como também recombinar estas zonas 

electrofiadas em arquitecturas fibrosas 3D alternativas. Para atingir este 

objectivo, três diferentes zonas de Policaprolactona (PCL) electrofiado 

foram montadas em diferentes arranjos dentro do hidrogel de óxido de 

grafeno (GO)-colagénio de modo a serem capazes de providenciar uma 

malha porosa apta para protocolos de cultura de células, depois do 

processo de liofilização. Estas estruturas porosas de PCL-GO-

colagénio foram caracterizadas de forma a avaliar a influência do 

tamanho e orientação das fibras nas propriedades finais da estrutura 

3D. Foram feitos testes de biocompatibilidade com condrócitos em 

cultura estática nas diferentes zonas fibrosas que compõem a estrutura 

porosa. Apesar dos resultados de biocompatibilidade serem 

promissores, estes mostraram que existe necessidade de continuar a 

optimização da porosidade das zonas fibrosas de forma a 

promover/facilitar a migração celular através da estrutura porosa antes 

de se fazer ensaios de culturas celulares em ambiente dinâmico num 

bioreactor.

Abstract 

 

Injuries of the articular cartilage are a huge problem in the present 

society. Cartilage tissue engineering is emerging as an alternative to 

traditional medical procedures by producing biomimetic scaffolds 

capable of mimicking the depth dependent nanostructural organization 

of the fibrous collagen network of the native articular cartilage. This work 

intended not only to optimize the pore size of the fibrous electrospun 

zones that comprise a 3D anisotropic scaffold previously developed by 

the research group of the supervision team, but also to recombine these 

electrospun zones in alternative fibrous 3D architectures. To achieve 

this goal, three electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) zones were 

assembled in different arrangements within a graphene oxide (GO)-

collagen hydrogel capable of providing a suitable porous network for cell 

culture protocols after a lyophilisation process. These PCL-GO-collagen 

scaffolds were characterized with the purpose of evaluating the 

influence of the fibres size and orientation on the final properties of 

these 3D structures. Preliminary biocompatibility tests on the different 

fibrous zones that compose the scaffolds were assessed with 

chondrocytes static cultures. Although the biocompatibility results were 

promising, the outcomes showed the need of the continuous 

optimization of the porosity of the scaffold fibrous zones in order to 

promote/facilitate the cell migration through the whole scaffold before 

starting the dynamic cell culture in a bioreactor.

INTRODUCTION 

 

1.1.  Framework 

Osteoarthritis is a chronic rheumatic condition, which is a degenerative disease that 

mainly affects the articular cartilage. It is claimed by the World Health Organization that 

osteoarthritis is one of the most disabling disease in developed countries. Indeed, 

symptomatic osteoarthritis is estimated to affect 9.6% of men and 18.0% of women aged 

over 60 years, causing serious limitations in movement. This is where cartilage tissue 

engineering could interfere in order to produce materials capable of recreating an in vitro 

tissue capable of mimicking the depth dependent nanostructural organization of the 

fibrous collagen network of the native articular cartilage by combining biomaterials and 

cells with suitable fabrication techniques [1]. 

One of these biomaterials is Polycaprolactone (PCL). PCL is a semi-crystalline polymer 

with a hydrophobic nature; it exhibits a very slow degradation rate (2–4 years depending 

on the starting molecular weight) that finds many applications in biomedical science owing 

to its superior mechanical properties, good biocompatibility, and complete degradation to 

nontoxic by-products. It is also a Food and Drug Administration approved material [2]. 

Additionally, PCL is commonly used for the production of multilayer electrospun 

scaffolds by varying both the fibre size and orientation would create scaffolds with 

different topographic and mechanical properties [2]. 

In this study it was prepared four different fibrous/porous architectures of PCL–

Graphene Oxide-collagen (PCL-GO-collagen) scaffolds aiming to bring together the 

advantages of the synthetic PCL, biocompatibility of collagen and the biochemical and 

mechanical properties of GO in order to mimic the anisotropic structure of the natural 

articular cartilage. The inclusion of collagen into PCL nanofibers was considered 

favourable to cell attachment [2]. Electrospinning was used as fabrication technique and 

the operating conditions were adjusted to obtain anisotropic scaffolds.  



10 Chapter 1 – Introduction 

 

 

 

At the end, the different electrospun zones that compose the scaffolds, as well as the 

PCL-GO-collagen scaffolds were morphologically, mechanically and biologically tested.  

The work developed in this thesis is integrated in the project “ARCADELIKE – 

DESENVOLVIMENTO DA ARQUITETURA FISIOLÓGICA DA CARTILAGEM 

DESENVOLVIDA IN-VITRO POR COMBINAÇÃO DE ESTÍMULO MECÂNICO E 

SCAFFOLDS FIBROSOS ANISOTRÓPICOS EM BIORREACTOR” (REF. PTDC/EMS-

TEC/3263/2014). The main objective of this project is to develop and fabricate anisotropic 

fibrous PCL scaffolds with depth-dependent variations in the fibrillar size and orientation in 

order to see how these variables dictate physical and mechanical properties, as well as 

the cellular response in both static and dynamic (mechanical stimulation) cultures. Also, 

this work is a sequence of a previous one that achieved a 3D fibrous scaffold with distinct 

biomimetic zones through the assembly of electrospun PCL fibres with different 

orientations by varying the electrospinning conditions [3]. 

 

1.2.  Objectives 

This work is intended to optimize the original fabrication technique, the mechanical 

properties of the scaffold and its biocompatibility. Thus, briefly, the goals of this thesis are:  

I) Optimization of the pores size of the electrospun PCL 3D structure in order to 

enhance the cell proliferation and migration towards the scaffold. 

II) Fabrication and characterization of four scaffolds with different anisotropic 

properties with the purpose of being used as alternative enhanced cartilage in 

vitro microenvironments able to promote cartilage regeneration by using 

different pathways. Indeed, we expect that the distinct anisotropic signatures of 

each scaffold could offer similar mechanical and topographical characteristics 

and then, theoretically, influence the cell behaviour differently. 

III) Evaluation of the biocompatibility of the different electrospun PCL zones that 

compose the 3D anisotropic fibrous structures. 

1.3.  Document Organization 

This dissertation is divided into six chapters. This first chapter presents a short 

introduction, which includes a framework of the theme and the objectives of the 

dissertation. The second chapter exposes the state of the art with some concepts about 



Chapter 1 – Introduction 11 

 

 

 

the natural articular cartilage, its constituents and tissue engineering (TE) related to it, 

scaffolds and nanofibrous scaffolds and the polymer polycaprolactone (PCL). The third 

chapter describes the methodology and the materials required to execute the 

experimental work. Results and their discussion are presented at chapter four. The fifth 

chapter presents the main conclusions taken from this work, and some suggestions for 

future work. Then it follows the references of the citations made in the work and finally 

annexes.

Chapter 2  

STATE OF THE ART 

 

 

This chapter introduces the main concepts that fundament the experiments described 

in this thesis, such as the anatomy of native articular cartilage (section 2.1) and the 

potential of TE techniques as alternative treatments for repairing the injured cartilaginous 

tissue (section 2.2) focusing on the significance of Polycaprolactone (PCL) biocompatible 

scaffolds (sections 2.3 and 2.4). 

2.1.  Articular Cartilage 

Articular cartilage is a specialized connective tissue that covers the ends of synovial 

joints that allows the transmission of physiological loads to the underlying subchondral 

bone and friction-free movement of articulating joints providing the basis for the 

movements of an organism. Since it is avascular (no blood supply) and aneural (no nerve 

endings), native cartilage owns a poor capacity to heal after injury [4][5]. 

The articular cartilage is organized into three different zones (Figure 1) that are 

assembled in a depth-wise dependent hierarchical structure defined as follows: 1) a 

superficial zone which is composed mainly by collagen type II fibres produced by 

chondrocytes that are oriented parallel to the surface of the subchondral bone surface; 2) 

a middle zone composed by collagen fibres randomly oriented; 3) a deep zone, where the 

collagen fibres are oriented perpendicularly to the surface on the interface cartilage-bone 

[6]. Additionally, there are even who considers a fourth zone, this being the final one and 

called the calcified zone, which is responsible to connect the cartilage tissue to the 

underlying subchondral bone [7,8]. The superficial zone makes up 10% to 20% of the total 

cartilage volume and has the highest amount of collagen. Having the highest amount of 

collagen translates in high tensile modulus, making this zone resistant to shear, tensile 

and compressive forces imposed by the articulation at the joint surface. The middle zone 

has around 40% to 60% of the total cartilage volume and is mostly composed of 

negatively charged proteoglycans (forming the hyaline cartilage), which in turn attract 



14 Chapter 2 – State of the Art 

 

 

 

positive charges accompanied with water, making it a stable hydrated structure. The 

proteoglycans present in the middle zone are what gives the cartilage its compression-

resistance properties due to the fact that it maintains the fluid within the tissue of the 

cartilage while it is being compressed. The deep zone represents 30% of articular 

cartilage and is responsible for providing the greatest resistance to compressive forces, 

since it has the collagen fibrils arranged perpendicularly to the articular surface [6,9]. 

 

Figure 1 - Section of cartilage with the three different zones: superficial tangential zone 

(STZ), middle zone and deep zone. A – cellular organization in the zones of articular 

cartilage; B – collagen fibre architecture. Adapted from: [9]. 

 

The cells that reside within the cartilage are chondrocytes, a highly specialized cell line 

that represents only 2% of the total tissue volume, being responsible for maintaining and 

producing the extra-cellular matrix (ECM), mainly collagen fibres and proteoglycans. The 

combination of these components with inorganic salts, small amounts of other proteins, 

lipids and glycoproteins is able to provide a suitable microenvironment capable of 

efficiently retaining water and consequently enhance the biomechanical properties, 

guaranteeing the functional behaviour of the cartilage [9,10]. The diffusion of nutrients and 

waste is possible due to the cyclical compression of the articular cartilage providing 

chondrocyte homeostasis and a stale ECM which in turn provides the articular cartilage 

frictionless joint and a stiff load-bearing tissue to absorb energy [11]. 



Chapter 2 – State of the Art 15 

 

 

 

Cartilage self-repair ability is very limited since it is an avascular tissue rich in ECM, but 

low in cell density (because of low mitotic potential of the chondrocytes). This is why 

cartilage lesions caused by trauma or diseases tend to progressively degrade the tissue 

and also originate diseases such as osteoarthritis. Indeed, small defects are healed with 

the migration of chondrocytes, but the big defects are healed with fibrillar cartilage which 

turns out to be insufficient [4,5,10,12]  

 

2.1.1.  Chondrocytes 

Chondrocytes are the resident cells of the hyaline articular cartilage. These highly 

specialized cells are responsible for the production of the basic ECM constituents: 

proteoglycans and collagen type II. Therefore they have an important role in maintenance, 

repair, development and remodelling of the cartilage ECM [9,12]. 

Chondrocytes are originated from mesenchymal stem cells and make up to 2% of total 

volume of articular cartilage. Also, depending on the anatomical regions of the cartilage, 

they vary in shape, number and size (Figure 2). In the superficial zone, chondrocytes are 

flatter, smaller and have greater density, enabling resistance to shear and tensile forces 

and, additionally, protecting and maintaining the deeper layers. In the middle zone, 

chondrocytes are spherical and have low density, making this zone the first line of 

resistance to compressive forces. While in the deep zone, chondrocytes are typically 

arranged in columnar orientation, parallel to the collagen fibres and perpendicular to the 

joint line, providing the greatest amount of resistance to compressive forces. They 

respond to different stimuli, such as growth factors, mechanical loads, hydrostatic 

pressures and piezoelectric forces. However, their potential for replication is limited, 

making cartilage healing a problem [9,13]. 

Chondrocytes are therefore essential for studies related to cartilage TE but when 

cultured in vitro they tend to dedifferentiate (that is, they lose their special form or function, 

or revert to an earlier developmental stage). So, supplemented medium and three-

dimensional culture structures are used to maintain the chondrocyte phenotype [12]. Also, 

chondrosenescence (the deterioration of chondrocyte function related to age-dependency) 

contributes for the age-related deregulation of subcellular signalling pathways in 

chondrocytes, which in turn decreases the synthetic capacity of the cartilage leading to 

the manifestation of diseases such as osteoarthritis [14,15].

2.1.2.  Collagen and Proteoglycans 

Collagen fibres (Figure 3) are one of the most common proteins in the body. It is mainly 

organized with three procollagen polyptide chains (approximately 100 amino acids each) 

that are coiled in a ?-helix to make what is called tropocollagen, which in turn assembles 

into larger fibres that crosslink in order to provide tensile strength. It’s diameter in articular 

cartilage is between 25-40 nm in size [10,17]. Collagen is a natural polymer found in skin, 

bone, blood vessels, cornea, cartilage, gut, inter-vertebral disc, tendons and ligaments 

and comprises approximately 25%-35% of total body protein in the form of elongated 

fibrils. It possesses good tensile strength and elasticity and it can be found outside and 

inside the body cells providing support to body tissues [18,19]. In the collagen family there 

are 28 genetically distinct collagen types, being the most abundant the collagen type I 

(skin, tendon, and bone), collagen type II (cartilage), and collagen type III (skin and 

vasculature). These fibrillar structures are essential for tissue architecture and integrity. 

[17].

Proteoglycans are made of polysaccharide-protein compounds with a ratio of 95% 

polysaccharide and 5% of protein, and can exist in monomer or aggregates. In the core 

we can find the polar polysaccharide glycosaminoglycan (GAG) which is covalently linked 

to the proteoglycans, acting as lubricant and shock absorber. It is also responsible for 

maintaining osmotic pressure which is essential to keep the equilibrium between the 

external stress caused and the fluid flow in the ECM, complementing the tensile strength 

of the collagen fibres [10,21]. Proteoglycans influence nucleation and growth in 

developing fibres and fibre diameter in mature fibres. They are anionic in nature and they 

can bind with collagen (Figure 4) through non-covalently bindings [20].

(GAG) chains of the proteoglycans. Adapted from [20].

2.2.  Cartilage Tissue Engineering 

Cartilage TE emerges from a growing need to create a more durable and functional 

replacement for the degenerated tissue of the native cartilage. The solution must be able 

to resist and operate in the same biochemical and mechanical conditions that the natural 

cartilaginous tissue is submitted to. The current clinical treatments, such as mosaicplasty, 

autologous chondrocytes injection, osteochondral autograft transplantation, osteochondral 

allograft transplantation and microfracture, show unsatisfactory long-term results, because 

of the new tissue formed lacking structural organization and having inferior mechanical 

properties when compared to the native tissue. Furthermore, cultured chondrocytes, both 

in vitro or in vivo, tend to dedifferentiate into fibroblast-like shape, changing the production 

from collagen type II into type I (typical for fibrillar cartilage and mature bone, which has a 

fibrous network) and consequently affecting the functional features of the cartilaginous 

tissue [12,22]. 

Usually, damage to the articular cartilage can be due to congenital anomalies, 

degenerative joint diseases (such as osteoarthritis) and traumatic injuries, which can 

affect every group age and are very painful. Since natural cartilage has an insufficient self-

repair mechanism due to its avascular and aneural nature, low level of chondrocytes 

density, low proliferative activity and the tendency of chondrocytes to de-differentiate, 

treatment of damaged articular cartilage constitutes a challenge [12,23]. In fact, it is 

affirmed by Kock et al. [24] that osteoarthritis could affect all ages and around 70% of 

people aged &gt;65 years is affected by this disease. Also, Klein et al. [1] claims that 

osteoarthritis affects around 27 million Americans, and 6.6 million people in England alone 

[25]. In fact, according to the World Health Organization, in 2010, among 289 diseases, 

osteoarthritis was considered the eleventh leading cause of years lived with disability, 

becoming then a research priority in the European Community countries [26]. Additionally, 

in the coming years the tendency to develop some type of osteoarthritis could get as high 

as 25% of the world population, making alternative approaches to the treatment of this 

disease be particularly valuable [27]. 

Taking all this into account, the goal and also the biggest challenge of cartilage TE is to 

recreate an in vitro tissue capable of mimicking the depth dependent nanostructural 

organization of the fibrous collagen network of the native articular cartilage by combining 

biomaterials and cells with suitable fabrication techniques. In this way, it will be possible to 

simulate the biochemical, mechanical and morphological properties of the native articular 



Chapter 2 – State of the Art 19 

 

 

 

cartilage and consequently provide enhanced chondrogenic conditions able to solve 

problems as osteoarthritis [1,28]. 

2.2.1.  Scaffolds 

TE is a combined field of knowledge and technologies (in engineering, materials 

science, biology and biomedicine) that are meant to improve or replace natural/biological 

tissues by combining biomaterials, advanced micro fabrication techniques and cell culture 

strategies. Scaffolds can be used as support for cell migration, proliferation and 

differentiation, in order to promote tissue regeneration [29]. For cartilage TE purposes, an 

ideal scaffold should be capable to provide a comfortable 3D niche for the cells and 

stimulate them to synthesize cartilage matrix, enabling the replacement of the native 

matrix until the new cartilage is formed. These scaffolds should: a) be biodegradable, 

sterile, biocompatible and non-toxic; b) have a porosity that allows the diffusion of 

nutrients and waste products, support cell attachment, proliferation, differentiation and 

ECM production; c) have elasticity and give mechanical support; d) be able to mimic the 

anisotropic morphology and biochemical environment of the different zones [12,30]. 

Modern scaffolds are usually made of natural or synthetic polymers. Some examples of 

natural polymers include proteins (such as silk, fibrin and collagen) and carbohydrates 

(such as agarose, alginate, hyaluronan and chitosan), which can both be used to fabricate 

highly biocompatible hydrogels able to encapsulate chondrocyte cells without inducing 

dedifferentiation. These biomaterials have good biocompatibility, but lack strength and 

dimensional stability due to gelation and rapid hydrolysis in aqueous media [11,12]. 

Hence, collagen and elastin-based substances are, for example, unlikely for vascular TE 

[31,32]. 

On the other hand, synthetic polymers exhibit better strength and adaptability (are 

easier to tune) compared to natural polymers, but often do not allow cells to maintain their 

phenotype, leading to the production of ECM with different properties. Polylactic acid 

(PLA), polyglycolic acid (PGA), polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) and polycaprolactone 

(PCL) (Figure 5) are some examples of synthetic polymers [11,12].  

So, the combination of both types of polymers is essential to the development of a 

scaffold capable of mimicking the biochemical composition of ECM, and at the same time, 

owning good mechanical properties [31,32]. This was shown by Ahmed et al. [33] when 

they combined collagen with synthetic polymers PLA and PLGA to develop a suitable 3D 

structure to grow chondrocytes with minimal dedifferentiation for cartilage repair. Also, the 



20 Chapter 2 – State of the Art 

 

 

 

fatigue levels of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel filled PCL scaffolds were studied at different 

dynamic conditions by Vikingsson et al. [34] with up to 100,000 cycles of unconfined 

compression, and it was shown that the scaffolds were able to maintain their morphology 

and stress-strain response, withstanding the compressive forces and therefore, showing 

that it can be used for regeneration of new tissue. In other example, Hsu et al. [35] 

showed that the combination of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) and PGA, modified with type II 

collagen, increased chondrocyte proliferation and higher glycosaminoglycans and 

collagen production.

[36] 

 

Additionally cartilage TE scaffolds can also be used in dynamic cell culture protocols, in 

order to predict their mechanical performance in vivo or/and to enhance cell response 

[37,38]. Indeed, several experimental studies using bioreactors concluded that appropriate 

mechanical stimulation can improve the mechanical properties of engineered cartilage 

[39]. For example, Spitters et al. have developed a bioreactor capable of combining cyclic 

mechanical loading and a nutrient supply similar to the cartilaginous microenvironment in 

order to modulate degenerative diseases [40]. In another work Jung et al. used 

mechanical stimulation of a 3D poly(lactide-co-caprolactone) to successfully enhance the 

chondrogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells, boost the production of 

cartilaginous ECM and promote the maintenance of chondrocyte phenotype [41].

2.2.1.1.  ELECTROSPUN NANOFIBROUS SCAFFOLDS 

Electrospinning is a technique known for its affordability, simplicity, vast range of 

material selection, and high flexibility in controlling diameters and spatial orientation which 

enables the production of nanofibrous scaffolds (Figure 6) with potential for applications in 

TE and regenerative medicine [42]. Thus, in order to mimic the fibrillar network of articular 

cartilage, nanofibrous scaffolds made by electrospinning are composed of fibres with 

diameters on a nano scale, making them able to mimic the natural cell-ECM interactions 

and therefore promote the production of cartilage-like tissue to provide a new organized 

matrix [11,24]. 

 

Figure 6 – Example of nanofibrous scaffold: homogeneous hyaluronic acid/collagen 

nanofibers and NaCl salts construct. Adapted from [42] 

 

In TE, fibrous biomaterials present the most convenient architecture due to their high 

porosity, high surface volume ratio and topographic resemblance to the natural ECM [42]. 

The nanofibre scaffolds possess high specific surface area for cell attachment, allow 

oxygen permeability and prevent fluid accumulation making it also great for nutrient 

transport. An higher microporous structure and a 3D biomaterial contact for cell 

interaction, makes it possible to control cellular orientation and morphology in order to 

achieve the intended ECM architecture [31,43]. 

These scaffolds can be made through a layer-by-layer method, varying both fibre size 

and orientation (by changing polymer concentration, collection conditions and collector 

velocity to make fibres aligned or randomly oriented), rendering them suitable for making 

scaffolds capable of mimicking the different zones in articular cartilage and its properties 

(such has its organizational characteristic, the ability to successfully support cartilage 



22 Chapter 2 – State of the Art 

 

 

 

formation and its superior mechanical features) [2]. The fact that is possible to make 

aligned fibres is very advantageous, because it is ideal for cells that prefer some specific 

type of cues to grow and migrate [31]. 

 

2.3.  Polycaprolactone (PCL) 

Polycaprolactone (PCL) is a biocompatible and biodegradable material used for 

medical applications, drug delivery systems and packaging materials. PCL shows higher 

potential to prevent postsurgical adhesion and has more advantages over other synthetic 

polymers like PLLA, PAG, PLA and PLGA such as better mechanical strength, granting 

more stability under ambient conditions, being cheaper and available in large quantities, 

and being able to last long enough for cell proliferation before it’s in vivo degraded, when 

compared to other synthetic polymers [44–46] 

PCL is a semi-crystalline and hydrophobic polymer soluble in a wide range of organic 

common solvents and hydrolyses under physiological conditions into water-soluble 

monomers [47]. Indeed, the concentration of the polymer (solute), the type and 

concentration of the solvent actively determines the characteristics of the resulting 

meshes/scaffolds [48]. Also, it is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 

material, presents a very slow degradation rate (2–4 years depending on the starting 

molecular weight) and has been used as a slow release drug delivery device and suture 

material since the 1980s. PCL possesses a predictable and single low melting point (50-

60ºC) and is characterized by its polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, being lower 

than PGA and PLA. Also, its rheological and viscoelastic properties allow it to be used in a 

wide range of scaffold fabrication technologies. Due to these characteristics, it’s use for 

scaffold fabrication is increasing within the TE community [49]. 

Yet, PCL has some limitations, its hydrophobic nature leads to decreased wettability of 

the surface which in turn disables the performance in cell adhesion, resorption and 

reproduction [44]. Also, PCL has poor mechanical strength for applications under load 

bearing conditions. In order to improve its mechanical properties, PCL can be combined 

with other materials, such as nanoparticles [45]. Actually the use of PCL combined with 

another material as a composite is very frequent, more than being used alone. A 

nanofibre composite scaffold was developed with PCL-graphene by Song et al. [50], 

proving that, besides having good mechanical properties (such as tensile stress and 

elastic modulus), it enhanced adhesion, differentiation and proliferation of mouse marrow 



Chapter 2 – State of the Art 23 

 

 

 

mesenchymal stem cells showing its higher biocompatibility if combined with other 

materials. In another study, electrospun PCL/GO-g-PEG structures (Figure 7) were 

studied for its structural and reinforcing effect. It resulted in improved tensile properties 

and the preliminary biological assay showed enhanced capability for supporting cell 

attachment and growth [51]. Also, as Zhang et al. [52] showed the possibility of combining 

PCL with other polymers, mainly gelatine, resulting in the development of a scaffold with 

better mechanical properties and favourable wettability, which in turn improved cell 

interactions, making it useful for applications in the biomedical field.

PEG 0.25 wt%; (b) PCL/GO-g-PEG 0.5 wt%; (c) PCL/GO-g- 

PEG 1.0 wt%. Scale bars are 20 µm. Adapted from [51]. 

 

PCL’s capability for spinning allows its production in a fibrous form. Since it is an easy 

to use and cost effective, electrospinning is the most popular technique to fabricate fibrous 

PCL scaffolds (Figure 8) in order to be used in a broad range of biomedical applications 

[47]. Electrospinning is effective in producing ultrafine fibres with diameters ranging from 

microns to a few nanometres, by using an electric field to convert polymer solution into a 

fibre form. This happens due to stress created by applying electric current, creating a 

deformation of the droplet, which is ejected as a fluid jet that is elongated and collected in 

a collection device [52].

2.4.  Polycaprolactone Scaffolds in Tissue Engineering 

Applications 

Recently, the use of PCL for scaffold fabrication has been increasing for biomedical 

applications, such as in the synthesis of complex biomaterials and TE. When making PCL 

electrospun-scaffolds it is important to know the factors that influence the cellular 

processes: fibre diameter, fibre alignment, elasticity, pore size distribution and porosity, 

surface topography and surface chemistry for improved cell-biomaterial interaction [49]. 

Dual fibrous structures composed of microfibers and nanofibers produced from PCL by 

wet electrospinning (which has a liquid collector instead of a solid one, in order to produce 

a bulky and fluffy material) are good to use as a scaffold. The fibres with bigger diameter 

have better mechanical properties and larger pore size (essential for three-dimensional 

cell distribution), while the fibres with smaller diameters are good for cell adhesion inside 

the scaffold [54]. 

Trilaminar fibrous scaffolds are important in order to mimic the morphological 

properties of articular cartilage. These scaffolds can support the production of cartilage-

like extracellular matrix with depth-dependent organization, and this was achieved by 

McCullen et al. [2] by sequential electrospinning (Figure 9). Varying fibre size and 

orientation of PCL while changing polymer concentration and collection conditions, made 

possible the formation of zonally distinct cartilage layers. Their results showed that 

trilaminar scaffolds yielded higher tensile properties compared to fully aligned and 

randomly oriented fibres of the same or larger diameters. The trilaminar scaffolds 



Chapter 2 – State of the Art 25 

 

 

 

managed to get not only aligned cell morphologies in the superficial zone and spread in 

the randomly oriented in the deep zone of the scaffold, but they also enhanced a superior 

production of collagen type II. 

 

Figure 9 – Different concentrations and collecting conditions of sequential electrospinning 

of poly(e-caprolactone) were performed to generate dense fibres. (A) zonal placement of 

varying fibre zones; (B) resultant electron microscopy images of the bulk anisotropic

5-mm fibres. Scale bar = 100 mm in (B) and 10 mm in (C–E). Adapted from [2]. 

 

In other report, Steele et al. [55] have produced bilayered scaffolds (Figure 10) by 

electrospinning in order to mimic the functional interfaces and organization of articular 

cartilage. They noticed that their scaffolds demonstrated zone differences in cellular 

proliferation, biochemical composition and gene expression, proving that their results 

could be used in developing regenerative medicine strategies. They acquired these 

results by making a fibre zone composed aligned electrospun PCL on the surface of a 

PCL 3D porous structure. In another study made by Yang et al. [56], a scaffold consisting 

of fibrous PCL and methacrylated gelatine was conceived, which allowed the creation of a 

multi-layered structure tendon-like through photo-crosslinking of scaffold sheets. They 

tested this scaffold with human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and noticed that the 

cells align along the orientation of the fibres and adopted tendon cell phenotype upon 

treatment with TGF-b3 growth factor, providing a mimic between the scaffold and natural 

tendon.

zone (FZ) deposited on a porous zone foam (PZ) forming an anisotropic scaffold. Adapted

Li et al. [57] showed that 3D nanofibrous PCL were able to successfully support 

chondrocyte phenotype and matrix deposition (including collagen type II and IX). They 

achieved this mark by seeding foetal bovine chondrocytes cultured in medium with ITS+ 

(Insulin, Transferrin, Selenium), ascorbate and dexamethasone fibrous scaffold, that was 

able to recreate biomimetic characteristics, concluding that the PCL nanofibrous was 

suitable in scaffold biomaterials for cartilage TE applications. 

The effects on mechanical properties of PCL could be enhanced by decreasing the 

fibre diameter, thus, improving the crystallinity, and by doing that, increasing the tensile 

strength and stiffness of the fibres, as shown by Wong et al. [58] when reducing the fibres 

to 700 nm. 

When using a swine model to repair cartilage defects, Li et al. [59] produced a 

biodegradable PCL nanofibrous scaffold seeded either with allogeneic chondrocytes or 

xenogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and compared them with an acellular 

PCL scaffold and a non-implant model. The difference was clear, the chondrogenic and 

MSC seeded scaffolds showed more complete repair when compared to the other two. 

Chondrogenic seeded scaffolds showed a fibro-cartilage like tissue, and the MSC ones 

showed hyaline cartilage like tissue. They also did a mechanical test showing that the 

highest equilibrium compressive stress was achieved by MSC-seeded scaffolds (1.5 



Chapter 2 – State of the Art 27 

 

 

 

MPA), followed by chondrocyte-seeded scaffolds (1.2 MPa) and the no-implant scaffold 

showing the lowest (0.2 MPa). 

In complex cartilage TE strategies, electrospun nanofibers can be combined with 

hydrogels, which add to the topographic cues a three-dimensional environment for the 

cells that can also be loaded with growth factors, making it useful for repair of damaged 

cartilage, among other applications [60]. By adding an hydrogel to a PGA nanofibrous 

scaffold, Yang et al. [43] managed to develop an easy way to handle and apply 

composites with three nanofibre mesh layers and different internal orientations. 

Additionally, they managed to get human corneal fibroblasts to attach and proliferate in 

the different zones, and at the end of two days, cells replicated the nanofibers orientation 

(both aligned horizontal and vertical, and random-middle zone). 

In another strategy, by using a perfusion reactor system, Silva et al. [61] managed to 

produce proliferation, support attachment and chondrogenic differentiation in bone-

marrow mesenchymal stem cells by using electrospun PCL nanofibre meshes at a 

concentration of 17%, producing nanofibers with a thickness between 40-60 µm, 70-80% 

of porosity and an average pore size of 2.7 µm. 

More recently an approach for tracheal TE was made by preparing a hybrid 3D scaffold 

based on PCL/Decellularized aorta (Figure 11). The mechanical properties, morphology, 

histology and also the outcomes of heterotopic transplantation in a rabbit were analysed. 

It was concluded that PCL maintained the rigidity of tissue engineered trachea when 

combined with the decellularized aorta and that it was suitable for  tracheal TE due to its 

good mechanical properties, biocompatibility and cell adhesion [62]. Through the 

combination of PCL scaffolds embedded with europium hydroxide nanorods (EHNs), 

Augustine et al. [63] proved that the scaffolds with smaller weight percentage of the EHNs 

had increased tensile modulus and in in vitro studies they showed to have improved 

biocompatibility and cell adhesion properties. Also in vivo testing showed enhanced 

angiogenesis proving it could be used for TE applications.

collagen, were seeded by primary chondrocytes and adipose derived mesenchymal stem

implanted into rabbit's muscle and harvested after 3 weeks. Adapted from [62]. 

 

The combination PCL-PEG-PCL both as a scaffold/hydrogel (Ko et al.[64]) and as a 

film (Fu et al.[65]) demonstrated the ability for cells to manifest chondrogenic phenotype 

and produce cartilaginous ECM. In fact, the PCL-PEG-PCL film was implanted in rat knee 

defects and eight weeks after surgery, a new cartilage-like tissue was formed in the defect 

site, showing a grate capacity for repair of cartilage defects. 

Graphene oxide and GO-polymer composites have been receiving special attention for 

its application in TE due to its biocompatibility and capacity for widely positive interaction 

and proliferation of different types of cells. A graphene oxide (GO)-poly (?-caprolactone, 

PCL) scaffold was created to confirm its good biocompatibility and myoblast 

differentiation. The results proved the biocompatibility of the scaffolds, being a good 

candidate for tissue regeneration[66]. 

Taking everything into account, in this thesis it is presented four different anisotropic 

PCL fibrous architectures capable of combining fibrous and porous features in order to 

recreate specific 3D biomimetic microenvironments that are able not only to simulate the 

depth-dependent variations of each cartilaginous zone, but also to provide a

protocols.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 

 

The starting point of the work described in this thesis was the conception and fabrication 

of an anisotropic tri-layered fibrous-porous PCL-GO-collagen scaffold developed by our 

research group through the on-going project “ARCADELIKE – DESENVOLVIMENTO DA 

ARQUITETURA FISIOLÓGICA DA CARTILAGEM DESENVOLVIDA IN-VITRO POR 

COMBINAÇÃO DE ESTÍMULO MECÂNICO E SCAFFOLDS FIBROSOS 

ANISOTRÓPICOS EM BIORREACTOR” (REF. PTDC/EMS-TEC/3263/2014). Therefore, 

this chapter will firstly describe the methods used for the design and fabrication of the 

original PCL-GO-collagen scaffold (3.1) in order to contextualize the work developed 

during the optimization of the porosity of the fibrous electrospun network (3.2), the 

fabrication and characterization of four different scaffold architectures (3.3) and the 

biocompatibility testing of the individual scaffold fibrous and porous components (3.4). 

 

3.1.  Scaffold Design and Fabrication 

In order to recreate the 3D anisotropic fibrous structure of the cartilage, two different 

electrospinning methodologies (NANON-01A electrospinning machine) were used: 

towards making the superficial and the deep zones it was used a rotating fibre collecting 

device, which allows the alignment of the fibres; for the middle zone an ethanol (C2H6O) 

and water (H2O) bath was used as the collector for the fibres in a random orientation (wet 

electrospinning). After that, the individual electrospun layers were assembled in the 

interior of a GO-collagen hydrogel and submitted through a lyophilization process to 

guaranty a biocompatible microporous porous structure capable of not only physically 

support the fibrous layers, but also improve the swelling properties of the overall system.  

The GO-collagen hydrogel was fabricated according to [67]. Briefly, a GO aqueous 

dispersion with a concentration of 4 mg/mL (from Graphenea®) and a collagen solution 



32 Chapter 3 – Materials and Methods 

 

 

 

(collagen type I of rat tail in a concentration of 2.16 mg/mL in 0.6% of acetic acid (First 

Link Ltd) were mixed at pH = 2 with a 24 %w/w ratio col/GO , shaken for 10 seconds and 

centrifuged (Thermo Scientific™ Heraeus™ Multifuge™ X1 Centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 

10 000 RPM. 

 

3.1.1.  Electrospinning Production of Fibrous Structures 

To prepare the scaffold, the polymer PCL used presented a molecular weight of 80 000 

Da, (Sigma Aldrich
®
). PCL was dissolved with a concentration of 12% in Dichloromethane 

and Dimethylformamide (Sigma Aldrich
®
) with a ratio of 8:2 (v:v) overnight while being 

agitated at room temperature. 

For the production of the superficial and deep zones (Figure 12), the PCL solution was 

electrospun with a flow rate of 1 mL/h, a voltage ranging between 18-25 kV, a working 

distance (needle-collector) of 15 cm and a spinneret velocity of 5 mm/s. To ensure the 

fibres alignment, they were deposited during 5 hours on an aluminium foil that was fixed 

on the rotating collector device with a diameter of 10 cm and a speed of 2500 rotations 

per minute (RPM). The resulting electrospun mesh (approximately 100 µm of thickness) 

was then cut into 5 mm diameter cylinders. For the deep zone, rectangles with 2 mm 

width and 4 cm length were cut and rolled up into the shape of a spiral with 5 mm of 

diameter. This process occurred within a GO-collagen hydrogel in order to have the 

fibrous spiral branches intercalated with a micro-porous network after the process of 

lyophilization.

The middle zone was electrospun (Figure 13) with a flow rate of 1 mL/h, with a voltage 

between 20-30 kV, for a period of 30-40 seconds, using a 10 cm working distance 

between the needle and an ethanol:water bath in a ratio of 9:1 (v:v). The middle zone 

fibres were then placed into a cylindrical mould (5 mm of diameter and 2.5 mm of high) for 

shaping and stored in distillate water.

3.1.2.  PCL-GO-Collagen Scaffold Assembling 

In order to assemble the scaffold, two moulds of Teflon were used, containing 6 

cylinders each. Both moulds have 5 mm in depth but vary in the diameters of the 

cylinders: the first mould present cylinders with a diameter of 5 mm and the second have 

10 mm of diameter (Figure 14). The mould with the smallest cylinder diameter was used 

to assemble the three different electrospun zones by combining the deep zone (5 x 2 

mm), the middle zone (5 x 2.5 mm) and the superficial zone (5 x 0.5mm), which thickness 

was achieved by piling up the small electrospun cylinders. All the electrospun layers were 

previous immersed in ethanol and distilled water before assembly in order to sterilize them 

and remove the impurities. After assembly, the 3D electrospun structures were stored in 

the freezer at -20ºC for 4h.

After this period, the frozen electrospun PCL structures were placed in the mould with 

the biggest diameter, which was previously filled with the GO-collagen hydrogel.  

Finally, the PCL-GO-collagen scaffolds were freeze-dried by lyophilisation (Telstar 

lyoQuest HT-40, Beijer Electronics Products) at -80 ºC in order to produce a 

complementary 3D fibrous-porous microenvironment (Figure 15).

incorporated in the hydrogel on the 5x10 mould and submitted to lyophilization.

3.2.  Optimization of Fibrous Structure Porosity 

In order to enhance cell migration and proliferation for future cartilage TE applications, 

it was required to optimize the structure porosity of the scaffold according to the results 

acquired through previous work (Table 1). The goal was to achieve a large percentage of 

pores with a diameter superior to 10 ?m.

of the rotating collector device and the horizontal velocity of the deposition needle were 

altered. The other variables were maintained constant in all tests: solution concentration 

(12% PCL), flow rate (1 mL/h), spinneret width (30mm), voltage (25kV) and working 

distance (15cm). 

The Table 2 summarizes the studied possibilities. Three different velocities were 

implemented on the rotating collector (25 RPM, 250 RPM and 2500 RPM) at a spinneret 

velocity of 10 mm/s and different spinneret velocities (1mm/s, 5mm/s and 10mm/s) at a 

rotating collector speed of 2500 RPM.

3.2.2.  Optimization of the middle zone 

In regard to optimize the middle zone porosity the only parameter that was changed 

was the horizontal velocity of the deposition needle (0mm/s, 1mm/s and 10mm/s), while 

the others were maintained, such as the time of deposition (30s), voltage (20-30kV), 

solution concentration (12% PCL), flow rate (1 mL/h) and working distance (5cm).  

3.3.  Different Architectures 

As soon as the fibrous structure porosity was optimized, four scaffold (PCL-GO-

collagen) architectures were designed in order to study the influence of the fibre 

orientation in the mechanical properties and consequently the cell response. The scaffolds 

were made by adapting the described protocol (Chapter 3.1) to different architecture 

designs that will be described in section 3.3.1. 

 

3.3.1.  Architectures Description 

Four architectures were chosen for the research. The selected architectures (Figure 

16) were denominated as H1 (the three zones of the scaffold described in the process of 

assembling at 3.1.1), H2 (composed by the superficial and middle zones), H3 (composed 

by the superficial and deep zones) and H4 (composed of middle and deep zones). All four 

architectures were made and assembled in the same moulds and in the same conditions 

as previously described (3.1.1). 



38 Chapter 3 – Materials and Methods 

 

 

 

H2 architecture was made with a 2.5 mm height superficial zone, achieved by stacking 

electrospun cylinders with a thickness of 100 µm, and a 2.5 mm height middle zone. 

H3 architecture was composed of a 2.5 mm height superficial zone and a 2.5 mm 

height deep zone. In order to acquire the 2.5 mm height deep zone, rectangles with 2.5 

mm width and 4 cm length were cut and rolled up into the shape of a spiral with 5 mm of 

diameter within a GO-collagen hydrogel in order to make the spiral intercalated with a 

micro-porous layer after the process of lyophilization. 

H4 architecture was built with a 2.5 mm height middle zone and a 2.5mm deep zone.

3.3.2.  Mechanical and Topographic Characterization 

The mechanical testing was done by using a Shimadzu MMT-101N (Shimadzu 

Scientific Instruments) (Figure 17) with a load cell of 100N. The compressive properties of 

the four different scaffold architectures were done in a wet state and they were 

compressed at a rate of 1 mm/min up to 15% of strain after a pre-charge of 0.07N. 

Although, the dimensions of the PCL-GO-collagen scaffolds tested were 10mm in 

diameter and 5mm in height, it was only considered a diameter of 5 mm since it was the 

right dimension for the interior fibrous structure of the scaffold. The compressive moduli of 

the samples were calculated through the study of the stress-strain curves calculated from 

the slope at low strain (0-15%). An identical methodology was applied for the three zones 



Chapter 3 – Materials and Methods 39 

 

 

 

when studied in separate, before the assembling into scaffold. The superficial zone 

samples had 5 mm diameter and 0.5mm height, while the middle zone samples had 2.5 

mm height and 5 mm diameter and the deep zone samples had 2 mm height and 5 mm 

diameter. Also, it was studied the tensile properties for the superficial zone, using the 

same protocol previously described after the set-up of the machine was changed to study 

tensile modulus. For this test the superficial zone samples had 15 mm in height, 5 mm in 

width and with 250µm thickness.  

The swelling properties were studied for the four different architectures and their 

structural resistance in water were evaluated by immersing the samples into distilled water 

at room temperature for a period of 24 h. The swelling ratio was calculated with the 

following equation: 

                       
       

  
 

The fibres diameter and the pore size characterization of the three different zones 

(sections 3.2 and 3.3.2) were made through pictures taken with scanning electron 

microscope (SEM) (Hitachi SU 70; Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Krefeld, F.R., 

Germany) and analysed with the ImageJ software. The samples were fixed with carbon 

tape (Emitech K950 equipment) on the specific support for SEM and suffered sputter 

coating with gold (Au) in order to be analysed in SEM. At least 5 samples were used for 

each test.

testing the tensile properties of a sample from the superficial zone. 

3.4.  Biocompatibility Testing 

To start testing the biocompatibility of the PCL-GO-collagen scaffolds, the various 

components that make the composition of the scaffolds were first studied separately, each 

electrospun PCL zone and the hydrogel (GO-collagen) so that it could be possible to 

analyse the cellular response in each scaffold component. Cartilage progenitor cells were 

used and at determined time-points, samples were evaluated for cell metabolic activity 

and morphology. 

 

3.4.1.  Cell Expansion 

The cells used for seeding the scaffolds were cartilage progenitor cell (Sigma Aldrich). 

These were the bovine (Bos taurus (Holstein-Fresian)) articular cartilage progenitor cell 

line that are able to re-differentiate into articular chondrocytes after extensive population 

doublings (&gt;30 population doubling). 

The cryopreserved cells were quickly thawed and cultured in 25 cm
2
 tissue culture 

flasks containing Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham (Sigma-

Aldrich), supplemented with 10% v/v inactivated foetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and 



Chapter 3 – Materials and Methods 41 

 

 

 

1% v/v penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37ºC under a 5% CO2 humidified 

atmosphere. The medium was refreshed every 3 days. Cells were harvested at pre-

confluence using a 0.25% trypsin/EDTA solution and used in the passage seven. 

 

3.4.2.  Cell Seeding 

Before cell seeding there were a few steps to consider in order to render the scaffolds 

to be suitable for cell proliferation. Scaffolds were sterilized in ethanol 70% for a period of 

at least 3 hours, washed with PBS three times (first for a period of 5 minutes, then 15 

minutes and at last 30 minutes) and incubated with culture medium for 2 hour to promote 

the increase of cell attachment. 

After this process, the scaffolds were ready for cell seeding. They were firstly seeded 

with 0,5 x 10
6 
cells/scaffold and incubated for a period of 2 hours at 37ºC under a 5% CO2 

humidified atmosphere. Afterwards, culture medium was added until it reached a final 

volume of 1mL per well. The scaffolds were maintained in culture in the same conditions 

as cell expansion for 21 days and the medium was refreshed every 3 days. Positive (only 

cells) and negative (only scaffold) controls were used. 

3.4.3.  Cytochemical Staining of Actin Filaments and Nuclei 

To have an idea of how, where and if the cells could infiltrate the scaffolds through all 

of its structure, a cytochemical staining of actin filaments and nuclei was used to visualize 

the cytoskeleton organization through the three different zones in separate for 1 and 2 

weeks. After fixation with 4% w/v paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilization with 

0.1% v/v Triton X-100, cells were stained for F-actin filaments (Phalloidin-iFluor 488; 

ABCAM) and for nuclei (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich) during 90 

minutes in the dark at 37º C and then visualized using a fluorescence microscope 

(Axioimager M2, Zeiss) with magnification of 10x/0.25. 

 

3.4.4.  Metabolic Activity Measurement 

The metabolic activity of the cells in the three different zones can be measured with the 

use of resazurin, a cell permeable compound that is blue in colour and non-fluorescent. 

When entering the cells, resazurin (dark blue in colour) is reduced to resorufin, a 

compound that is red in colour and highly fluorescent. The cells with viability will 



42 Chapter 3 – Materials and Methods 

 

 

 

continuously convert resazurin to resorufin, increasing the overall fluorescence and colour 

of the media surrounding the cells. The fluorescent or colorimetric signal generated from 

the test corresponds to the number of living cells in the sample. Then, by fluorometric or 

light absorption measurement, the amount of dye conversion in the solution is measured. 

To avoid measuring cells attached to the well surface, scaffolds were transferred to a 

new 24 well plate. Then, a 10% (v/v) of resazurin solution (0.1 mg/mL in PBS) with 

medium was added to each well and incubated at 37°C between 1-5 h. Afterwards 100 µL 

per well was transferred to a 96-well plate and absorbance was measured at 570 nm and 

600 nm using a microplate reader. The absorbance deduced for all the cell-seeded 

scaffolds was a result of the ratio optical density (OD.) 570/OD. 600 nm minus the OD. 

570/OD. 600 nm ratio of a blank (resazurin media incubated in the absence of cells) and 

minus the OD. 570/OD. 600 nm ratio of a negative control (resazurin media incubated with 

the control scaffold). 

 

3.4.5.  Cell morphology visualization through SEM 

As a complementary test to the visualization of cells done with the staining described in 

section 3.4.3, cell morphology visualization through SEM was made. This test was made 

to the superficial zone at the end of three weeks. 

At the end of three weeks of culture in a 24 well culture plate, the chondrocyte seeded 

(0,5 x 10
6 

cells/well) superficial zone was washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% 

paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 minutes, and dehydrated through a gradient series of 

ethanol from 70% to 100% and dried. Prior to SEM (Hitachi SU 70; Hitachi High-

Technologies Corporation, Krefeld, F.R., Germany) analysis, the samples were fixed with 

carbon tape (Emitech K950 equipment) on the specific support for SEM and suffered 

sputter coating with gold (Au) in order to be analysed.  

 

3.4.6.  Statistical Analysis 

The values expressed for the resazurin measurement correspond to the mean ± 

standard deviation of five samples. The analysis of the ANOVA multiple values were used 

for the statistical analysis of the results in ORIGIN with the combination of the Turkey test. 

The value p&lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 

4.1.  Optimization of Fibrous Structure Porosity 

As previously described (section 3.2) the PCL electrospun fibres for the superficial and 

deep zones had a diameter of 1.2±0.5 µm and an average pore size of 2.6 ± 1.9 µm. 

While the middle zone had a diameter 2.2 ± 0.3 µm and an average pore size 9.0 ± 4.4 

µm. With the intention of optimizing the porosity and consequently enhancing cell 

migration and proliferation, a variation to the velocity of the rotating collector device and 

the horizontal velocity of the deposition needle were implemented for the fibres to be used 

as superficial and deep zones. For the middle zone, the horizontal velocity of the 

deposition needle was the only variable altered. 

4.1.1.  Optimization of Superficial and Deep Zones 

When referring to the effect of RPM in the characteristics of the electrospun fibres 

(Figure 18) it is perceptible that the increasing of the collector velocity is directly 

proportional to the decreasing of the fibre diameter (50 RPM: 2.1 ± 0.3 µm; 250 RPM: 2.0 

± 0.4 µm; 2500 RPM: 1.1 ± 0.5 µm) and also in an increase of the number of pores with 

size&amp;lt;5 µm. Indeed it was expected that with a higher RPM, the fibres would have a 

bigger degree of alignment and therefore a smaller pore size when compared to lower 

RPM. The decisive aspect for choosing between 50 and 250 RPM was that, despite the 

slight difference between the produced fibres, at 250 RPM it was observed that the 

electrospun meshes had a bigger percentage of pores &gt;10 µm making it more suitable for 

cell proliferation.

electrospun meshes. Needle horizontal velocity = 10mm/s. (a) SEM image of 50 RPM fibres:

image of 2500 RPM fibres: diameter = 1.1 ± 0.5 µm; (d) Pore size distribution (%) with 

influence of the rotating collector device. 

 

In the case where the needle horizontal velocity was changed (Figure 19), there is no 

visible difference in fibre diameter that could have a significant impact (1 mm/s: 1.1 ± 0.5 

µm; 5 mm/s: 1.1 ± 0.4 µm, 10 mm/s: 1.1 ± 0.5 µm). On the other hand at a lower velocity 

(1 mm/s) it is noticeable a bigger percentage of small pores (&lt;5 µm), while the biggest 

percentage of big pores (&gt;10 µm) was acquired at an intermediate velocity (5 mm/s). This 

result is justifiable with the fact that at this velocity it is possible to have a better 

distribution of fibres in the collector, avoiding the overlap of fibres registered at the lowest 

and highest velocity.

image of 10 mm/s: fibre diameter = 1.1 ± 0.5 µm; (d) Pore size distribution (%) with influence 

of the needle horizontal velocity. 

 

Therefore, the selected parameters for what was considered “optimal conditions” were 

a velocity of the collector device of 250 RPM and a needle horizontal velocity of 5 mm/s 

(Figure 20). In fact, when comparing the initial fibres (fibre diameter 1.2 ± 0.5 µm and an 

average pore size of 2.6 ± 1.9 µm.) with the ones produced in these conditions, it was 

acquired fibres with 1.3 ± 0.3 µm and an average pore size of 6.3 ± 1.9 µm, presenting 

around 85% of its pores equal or bigger than 5 µm. This numbers make these fibres more 

likely to induce proliferation and migration of cells due to bigger porosity when compared 

with the initial fibres.

4.1.2.  Optimization of Middle Zone 

The horizontal velocity of the deposition needle was the only variable that was changed 

for the middle zone while trying to improve its porosity. The results did not show a 

significant alteration in the fibres porosity (Figure 21). Although at a spinneret velocity of 

10 mm/s the fibres had a bigger percentage of pores with size &gt;10 µm, the manual 

manipulation of the sample/fibres made it hard to collect fibres without damaging them. 

The percentage of pores with size&amp;lt;5 µm was almost the same throughout all the 

variations of speed. For these reasons it was chosen the 0 mm/s spinneret velocity which 

made the manipulation of the fibres easy and had a significant percentage of pores with 

size &gt;10 µm. These fibres had a diameter of 2.2 ± 0.3 µm and an average pore size of 9.0 

± 4.4 µm

4.2.  Mechanical and Topographic Analysis 

As described in section 3.3, all the different electrospun zones (superficial, middle and 

deep) together with the four architectures were studied with the purpose of evaluating in 

which way the modifications in the fibres alignment and final depth dependent structure 

influenced the mechanical properties and therefore could impact the cellular response. In 

fact, the different anisotropic architectures had distinct mechanical properties due to their 

different topography. As expected it was possible to determinate the compressive moduli 

of each individual zone by calculating the slope of the typical linear region of the stress-

strain curves (Figure 22a) [68–70]. Their respective compressive moduli and the 

superficial zone Young’s modulus are presented in Table 3. The deep zone presents a 

lower R
2
 (0.98 ± 0.01) than the other two electrospun zones (R

2
 superficial = 0.982 ± 

0.004 and R
2
 middle = 0.982 ± 0.008) probably due to the fact that the fibrous branches of 



48 Chapter 4 – Results and Discussion 

 

 

 

the spiral are intercalated by a heterogeneous microporous GO-collagen network (Figure 

23) [67]. It was considered 15% of strain in the three zones for the calculation of the 

compressive modulus because for all samples R
2
 &gt; 0.95 [2] and due to the fact that it was 

the limit of deformation from that the scaffolds totally recovered their initial height, which is 

a value compatible with the physiological properties of the native cartilaginous tissue 

[71,72]. 

In Figure 22b it is possible to compare the compressive moduli of all the three different 

zones. It can be concluded that the deep zone has the highest compressive modulus 

(164.46 ± 24.11 kPa) when compared to the other two zones (superficial = 27.33 ± 3.42 

kPa and middle = 24.53 ± 8.49 kPa). This could be explained by the fact that, like in the 

natural cartilage, the deep zone presents fibres that are orientated vertically which could 

offer more resistance to the applied load. Also, if we compare to the natural cartilage, the 

deep zone is likewise the one which presents a higher compressive modulus [11]. When 

comparing the superficial and middle zone, they offer no significant difference between 

themselves. They do represent a lower compressive value when compared to Kim et al. 

[73] fibres which had a compressive modulus of 80 ± 20 kPa. The difference could be due 

to the fact that in this work it was used a flow rate of 1 mL/h and 30 s time of deposition, 

whilst Kim et al. used a flow rate of 2 mL/h and 10 minutes of deposition time, having a 

more dense final structure and enhancing its mechanical properties when compared to the 

ones in this study. 

Figure 22c shows a representative tensile stress-strain curve (R
2 

= 0.99) of the 

superficial zone. It showed a Young’s modulus of 11.94 ± 1.14 MPa that, when compared 

to several bibliography showed to have a higher Young’s modulus (3.7 MPa of 13% PCL 

[74]; 3.8 ± 0.8 MPa of 15% PCL [75]; 4.98 MPa of 10% PCL [52]). This could be explained 

by the rotation applied by the collector (at 1500 RPM), that the referred examples did not 

have (they were stationary). Indeed, the effect of the collectors velocity results in a better 

horizontal alignment of the fibres (and reduced pore size), which had the same direction 

as the force applied in the mechanical testing, culminating in an increased tensile 

modulus. For example, Thomas et al. [76] proved that a bigger rotation velocity of the 

collector improved the average tensile strength from 2.21 ± 0.22 MPa, at 0 RPM to 9.58 ± 

0.71 MPa at 6000 RPM.

The compressive moduli of the different architectures and their respective swelling ratio 

are presented in Table 4. When studying the compressive modulus of the scaffolds 

(Figure 24) it was observable that the architecture H1 (superficial+middle+deep = 38.07 ± 

4.48 kPa) conferred a similar compressive modulus to the one of H2 (superficial+middle = 

38.90 ± 3.06 kPa). One possible explanation for this is that the deep zone (that is 

presented in H1) has a compressive modulus that is much superior when compared to the 

other zones and therefore suffering less deformation. And since the deformation is only 

applied until 15%, it is not enough to see the mechanical response of the deep zone. For 

this reason, the compressive moduli of H1 and H2 are similar at 15% because essentially 

only represent the effect of the superficial and middle zone. This result reveals that the 

connection between the three zones in H1 must be optimized in order that the 

compressive modulus is not only affected by the superficial and middle zone, but by the 

three zones. One possible strategy is to establish chemical bonds between the PCL fibres 

of the three zones. 



Chapter 4 – Results and Discussion 51 

 

 

 

It is possible to conclude that the deep zone plays a key role in both the mechanical 

and swelling behaviour of the scaffolds. In fact, the architectures where the presence of 

the deep zone is more significant (H3 and H4 - 50% of the total high) present higher 

compressive moduli relatively to the other scaffolds (40% in H1 and 0% in H2). One 

possible explanation for the considerable difference between the compressive moduli of 

H4 (86.27 ±11.94 kPa) and H3 (60.12 ±11.31 kPa), which is surprising since the 

superficial and middle zones present similar compressive moduli, can be related with the 

superior swelling ability of the scaffold H4. In other words, as the middle and deep zones 

present respectively a larger fibre-fibre distance and a GO-collagen microporous network 

intercalated with fibrous branches, the scaffold H4 is more capable of retaining water 

comparatively with the scaffold H3, which in contrast presents a significant superficial 

zone with smaller pores. Consequently, it is possible that the larger amount of retained 

water contributes to a more efficient zone-zone assembly during the freezing process 

(Figure 15) and therefore to a more compact 3D structure.  

When comparing the scaffolds compressive moduli values with the ones from natural 

articular cartilage, we can see that the scaffolds have lower compressive moduli since the 

natural cartilage, depending on the zone, could have compressive moduli of 1-19.5 Mpa 

[11,77]. This in turn has advantages and disadvantages. In one side, the inferior 

mechanical properties if meant to only promote initial engineered tissue growth in vitro, 

they don’t require the level of mechanical strength of the natural cartilage. Since the 

scaffold will be meant to act as a supportive environment to help maintain the phenotype 

of the chondrocytes (which could be proved difficult) and therefore promote the formation 

of new tissue/ECM that then should withstand the same mechanical characteristics of the 

natural cartilage [78,79]. On the other hand, low mechanical properties could be directly 

affected by the degradation rate of the scaffold (the rate of scaffold degradation should be 

proportional to the rate of tissue formation to ensure sufficient mechanical support) [79]. 

As a solution, the implementation of mechanical stimuli through the use of a bioreactor, 

has been showed to improve the mechanical properties by increasing cell proliferation and 

ECM production guaranteeing the anisotropic distribution of collagen in engineered 

cartilage [24].  

The swelling ratio showed no significant difference between the different architectures, 

proving that their capacity to retain water is slightly affected by the difference between the 

architectures (with the exception of H4 as previously described). The main influence in the 

swelling of the different architectures is probably due to the porous structure of the GO-

collagen that is part of the final scaffold. Since PCL is a hydrophobic in its essence, the 



52 Chapter 4 – Results and Discussion 

 

 

 

retained water is mainly accomplished by the GO present in the scaffold that by nature 

has a high potential to store and adsorb water molecules due to the oxygen-containing 

functional groups on its hydrophilic surface [80–82].

4.3.   Biocompatibility Testing 

In order to characterize the scaffolds for their capability to sustain an environment for 

cells it was required the visualization of the cells nuclei and cytoskeleton through the 

staining of actin filaments, the SEM visualization of the cells presence in the superficial 

zone and the measurement of their metabolic activity. 

4.3.1.  Cytochemical Staining of Actin Filaments and Nuclei 

The actin present in the cytoskeleton is determinant for chondrocyte shape which 

influences chondrogenic differentiation and ECM production, and it is by itself a signal for 

the presence of cells in the scaffolds [83]. To analyse the presence of the cells in the three 

different zones a cytochemical staining of actin filaments and nuclei was made. The 

images (Figure 25) were taken with a fluorescence microscope after 1and 2 weeks of 

culture.  

The superficial zone revealed to be suitable for cells because it shows a large quantity 

of cells (nucleus in blue and the filaments in green) in its surface both at 1 and 2 weeks 

with no significant differences through time. This could be because the superficial zone is 

mainly 2D and in general way, 2D cultures are very suitable for all kind of cells, including 

chondrocytes. But the 2D kind of structure could also have limitations. If the cells don’t 

infiltrate the scaffold and remain in a 2D structure they could: a) not provide the ECM 

structure of natural cartilage which is depth-dependent; b) make the chondrocytes lose 

their phenotype since it isn’t taken to account the 3D natural cartilage structure and 

dedifferentiate into a fibroblastic-like morphology of chondrocytes that would lead to 

decreased ECM production, up regulation of collagen type I gene expression and down 

regulation of collagen type II gene expression [84–87]. 

At the first week, the middle zone presented big adherence for the cells since it is very 

noticeable their presence in its structure. But by the second week this changed drastically 

has it isn’t possible to see a single cell in the structure. Some reasons can be pointed out 

for this result. The first is the manipulation of the samples by itself, as it was required to 

change the samples from well at the end of 1 week, which in turn could force the 

detachment of cells or a simple unnoticed error committed that could have killed the cells. 

Another one is the variability of the samples, since the manufacturing of the middle zone 

didn’t allow complete control of the sample size as well as pore size. Chondrocyte size is 

difficult to define since they have a big variation in volume when in hydration state and 

could have cytoplasmatic processes of&amp;lt;8 µm [88]. Some report that chondrocyte size is 



54 Chapter 4 – Results and Discussion 

 

 

 

around 10-12 µm and that could get as large as 40 µm ([89]), others report 20 µm ([90]) 

and in more recent studies of osmolarity it was registered a cell volume of ~597 µm
3 
([88]). 

Because of this big variability in chondrocyte size and volume, and their response to 

hydration, and since the middle zone has a pore of 9.00±4.44 µm, the cells could have 

simply not had space to grow and infiltrate in the middle zone structure and detach from 

the structure and therefore not being visible.

The deep zone presented a difficult structure to evaluate since it isn’t possible to 

determine the presence of cells at the seventh day due to a problem of autofluorescence. 

Autofluorescence is when the material emits fluorescence signals that are difficult to be 

distinguished from the emitted signals of externally added fluorescence markers [91]. PCL 

is by itself autofluorescent, but comparing to the other zones pictures, it doesn’t have a big 



Chapter 4 – Results and Discussion 55 

 

 

 

effect since it is still possible to see the cells. In the case of the deep zone, the problem 

stands with the GO. GO is an autofluorescent material, showing its autofluorescence 

through a big part of the emission spectrum: near-infrared, visible and ultraviolet [92,93]. A 

way to address this problem is to stain the samples with a labelling dye that has an 

excitation wavelength outside of the excitation spectrum of autofluorescent GO [91]. As 

the same problem would repeat itself at week 2, it was decided not to take the picture of 

the respective day. 

 

4.3.2.  Metabolic Activity Measurement 

The metabolic activity of cells cultured in scaffolds and under control conditions was 

evaluated by the resazurin metabolism assay. The cells, when metabolically active, 

induce the reduction of resazurin to resafurin, inducing a chemical change from blue to a 

red colour. The metabolically active and proliferating viable cells will be proportionate to 

the resazurin reduction obtained [94,95]. It is a precise, simple and quick method which is 

non-cytotoxic and does not require the death of cells, making them viable for reuse for 

further investigations [94,96]. The results are shown in Figure 26 for the metabolic activity 

after 1 week, 2 weeks and 3 weeks. 

In the first week, the superficial zone was the one that showed more metabolic activity 

and therefore had more cells residing in its structure when comparing to the others. This is 

probably due to the already explained fact of the 2D structure of the superficial zone, 

which is excellent for cell proliferation. The middle zone is the second to present high 

metabolic activity, followed by the deep zone and the GO-Collagen scaffold. The GO-

Collagen scaffold presented a low value probably due to the special characteristic of GO. 

GO biocompatibility is very dose-dependent, as well as dependent from its 

physicochemical properties (size, surface charge, particulate state, surface functional 

groups and residual precursors), influencing the biological/toxicological activity [97,98]. It 

has been demonstrated by Wang et al. [97] that below 20 µg/mL GO had low cytotoxicity 

and that above 50 µg/mL it showed to be cytotoxic, leading to low survival rate, inducing 

cells to float and cell apoptosis and even providing organ failure and turning deadly when 

injected in mice at certain doses. This effect was increased as the time passed, causing 

increased cytotoxicity and leading to more apoptosis. It was registered that GO could 

internalize the cells to its nucleus, disturbing cell metabolism and gene expression by 

creating reactive oxygen species (ROS) [97–99]. For these reasons, the GO-Collagen 

scaffold probably presented less affinity for cells. Another explanation for these low values 



56 Chapter 4 – Results and Discussion 

 

 

 

could be the loss of structural stability of the GO-Collagen scaffold due to its degradation 

proving its highly dispersible characteristic in media due to the presence of oxygenated 

functional groups [99], that perhaps leads to cell detachment. This effect could be 

exacerbated by the scaffold manipulation during culture time. This behaviour can be also 

observed in the deep zone because it also contains GO-Collagen in its structure for 

maintaining its form. 

In a general way it is possible to see that for the superficial and middle zone there is a 

slight decrease in metabolic activity throughout the weeks [the value verified for the 

middle zone at the third week is significantly lower than the values at the first and second 

week; the value verified for the superficial zone at the first week is significantly higher than 

the other values verified at the second and third week; according to the statistical 

analysis], possibly due to PCL current physical structure (pore size and distribution and 

fibre size) or for its chemical structure (making it hydrophobic) they could start to detach 

and adhere to the well surface or start dying at some point in time. A solution for this could 

be the functionalization of PCL with other substances (for example adhesion proteins) or 

materials (other polymers) to increase cell adhesion [100]. 

Although the middle zone visually presents higher metabolic activity than the superficial 

zone at the second week, the difference is not statistically significant. This gets in conflict 

with the results from the cytochemical staining obtained in this study, where we can see 

that there is no presence of cells in the second week in contrast to the superficial zone. 

This only reveals the big variability of the samples, which could make some samples more 

suitable as an environment for cell proliferation then others.

4.3.3.  Cell morphology visualization through SEM 

As a parallel test to the staining of the actin and nuclei of the chondrocytes, it was 

proceeded a visualization of the cells morphology in the superficial zone using SEM. In 

Figure 27 it is possible to see with different scales (at 20 µm, 30 µm and 100 µm) and 

after three weeks of culture the presence of chondrocyte cells attached and spread to the 

surface of the superficial zone. They appear to be flattened and have their cytoplasmatic 

projections prolonging the cells body. This proves that the superficial zones were capable 

of sustaining cells after that period of time, and maintain a typical cell morphology [101].

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 

 

5.1.  Conclusions and Future Work 

As initially intended, the optimization of the pore size for the three different zones was 

accomplished. For the superficial and deep zone the optimization led to a bigger 

percentage of pores with diameter superior than 10 µm. The middle zone optimization 

revealed that the previous electrospinning procedure (with the spinneret in static position) 

was the one to choose because it showed suitable pores and the final 3D electrospun 

zone was easier to manipulate when compare to the other options (spinneret velocity of 1 

mm/s and 10 mm/s).  

In the same way, the construction of four different anisotropic structures was 

successful and the mechanical tests revealed that the deep zone presented a higher 

compressive modulus when compared to the other two zones, which goes in agreement 

with the mechanical properties of natural cartilage. Indeed, the scaffolds that presented 

deep zones in their fibrous architectures had higher compressive modulus. The 

compressive modulus of the scaffolds is also influenced by the presence of the GO-

collagen porous network due to its capacity to retain water. Although the mechanical 

features of all the PCL-GO-collagen scaffolds presented values compatible with cartilage 

tissue engineering protocols, it was also suggested that the deformation applied to the 

scaffold is sometimes not uniform, which requires consequently a way to connect the 

several zones of the scaffolds through PCL. One solution could be to establish chemical 

bonds between the zones of electrospun PCL. The scaffolds showed less mechanical 

properties than the natural cartilage which is somehow beneficial if it is only intended to 

seed the cells and have them proliferate and produce ECM. Additionally, the 

implementation of mechanical stimulation during cell culture could theoretically improve 

the mechanical properties of the scaffold. 

Although having good results in a general way, the manipulation of the different zones 

that make up the scaffold are yet to be optimized since apparently they don’t allow the 



60 Chapter 5 – Conclusions and Future Work 

 

 

 

chondrocytes cell culture to run in an efficient way. The seeding technique should also be 

optimized in order to enhance the contact between the cells and the scaffold 

As it was observed, the superficial zone presented the best results in terms of cell 

proliferation and adhesion, but the pore size was still insufficient for allowing cellular 

migration, which is also noticeable in the other two zones. As a result of that, there is a 

need to optimize the fibrous structure porosity in order to have a pore size that could 

provide cellular migration and infiltration in the structure of the scaffolds in order for them 

to be functional. The preliminary biocompatibility evaluation shows high dependence on 

the optimization of the different zones in order to improve the accomplished results, 

through possible optimization of pores size and/or functionalization of the PCL with 

substances like adhesion proteins, in order to have more cells proliferating and thriving in 

the structure. If the cells have conditions to seed in a satisfying way and are able to 

proliferate and produce ECM, they will contribute for the maintenance and a better 

mimicking of the natural articular cartilage like microenvironment. 

It should be done further degradation tests of the GO-collagen porous structure in order 

to evaluate if the current concentration of GO that is used in the construction of the 

scaffolds is causing any type of cytotoxicity for the cells.

During the last few years, graphene has being playing a central role in a wide range of 

biomedical engineering strategies, including biosensors, brain-computer-interactions and 

regenerative medicine. In fact, and regarding this last topic, graphene based materials are being 

increasingly used in tissue engineering (TE) applications due to their capability of combining their 

excellent electrical and mechanical features with the properties of biomaterials such as polymers 

with the final purpose of recreating in vitro complex 3D extracellular matrix architectures able to 

support an enhanced cellular response [1].  

Thus, in this work, we successfully explored the potential of the graphene oxide (GO) sheets to 

act as functional building blocks by using collagen as physical crosslinker. Indeed, the electrostatic 

interactions between the two materials have allowed the fabrication of a self-assembled hydrogel 

capable of providing a suitable porous network for both static and dynamic cell culture protocols [2]. 

Additionally, and complementary to its enhanced chemical, mechanical and morphological 

properties, the GO-collagen scaffold also revealed an impressive versatility since its bulk 

characteristics can be easily modified to match specific TE aims. Indeed, by either adapting its 

conductivity via a reduction process or modulating its topographic cues via the incorporation of a 

3D anisotropic Polycaprolactone (PCL) electrospun network, the GO-collagen scaffold proved to be 

able to mimic different cellular microenvironments such as neural and cartilage, respectively.

The major challenge and also the main opportunity of cartilage tissue engineering is to 

recreate in vitro the depth dependent nanostructural organization of the fibrous collagen 

network that comprises the native cartilaginous tissue. In fact, the fibre size and 

orientation rearrangement of the cartilage natural extracellular matrix progresses from 

perpendicular to the subchondral bone surface in the deepest zone, to random in the 

middle zone and to parallel in the superficial region, leading to anatomically and 

functionally complementary features that are responsible for the biochemical and 

mechanical properties of this tissue. Though the encouraging results of both fibrous and 

porous scaffolds during the past few years, none of the followed methodologies is 

currently capable of guaranteeing an optimal balance between biological features, 

mechanical properties and suitable topographic cues. 

Thus, in this study, with the purpose of accurately recreating each cartilaginous zone, 

we purpose a versatile design and fabrication strategy involving the combination of 

different electrospinning set ups that are sequentially used to control the size and 

alignment of the Polycaprolactone (PCL) fibres towards a 3D structure. In this way, we 

were able to adapt the methodology in order to develop alternative fibrous scaffolds with 

distinct anisotropy properties capable of offering singular mechanical and topographic 

characteristics and therefore theoretically influence cell behaviour differentially. The 

morphology of the 3D electrospun scaffolds together with their individual fibrous zones 

were analysed via SEM and their mechanical properties were evaluated via static and 

dynamic (via a bioreactor) compressive and tensile tests.  

The results confirmed that although the mechanical and swelling properties of the 

electrospun scaffolds are related with the specific anisotropic organization used in each 

design, all the scaffolds show compatible features for cartilage cell culture protocols and 

therefore the potential of being used as alternative enhanced cellular microenvironments 

capable of promoting cartilage regeneration using different pathways.

Cellular response to anisotropic fibrous/porous electrospun scaffolds for 

cartilage tissue engineering

Tissue engineering (TE) strategies for repairing and regenerating articular cartilage 

face critical challenges to approximate the biochemical and biomechanical 

microenvironment of native tissues. The major challenge of TE cartilage is to mimic their 

mechanical properties to the native ones. The importance of the arcade-like collagen 

structure for the load-bearing properties in native cartilage is well emphasized in literature, 

but few studies have assessed the importance of collagen fibril depth-orientation on the 

mechanical properties of engineered-cartilage. To generate spatially-varying properties 

into TE-cartilage scaffolds, several combined cell-scaffold methods have been reported. 

Electrospinning allows the formation of arrays of aligned and random polymer-based 

nanofibers mats that can be assembled to mimic the structure of the native cartilaginous 

extracellular matrix. Mechanical stimulation can also be performed in order to create an 

anisotropic distribution of collagen in engineered-cartilage. Thus, a new series of 

anisotropic fibrous/porous electrospun scaffolds of polycaprolactone/collagen/graphene 

were developed and their biocompatibility evaluated with and without mechanical 

stimulation using a bioreactor. First, anisotropic fibrous layers of PCL with depth-

dependent variations in the fibrillar size and orientation were electrospun and then 

assembled and incorporated within a microporous graphene oxide/collagen structure. 

Several architectures were produced and tested in vitro. For this, a cartilage progenitor 

cell line was used and the cell metabolic activity, morphology and distribution throughout 

the scaffolds were accessed. The results, both static and dynamic, revealed that the 

scaffolds could not only allow cells’ adhesion, but also cell proliferation. Overall, 

polycaprolactone/collagen/graphene oxide scaffolds generated a good cellular response 

and were able to support cell proliferation. The effect of mechanical stimulation under 

physiological conditions is discussed. This work was supported by the funding of Program
