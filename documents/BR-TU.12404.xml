ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 

A thesis like this is never the product of a single mind. I have drawn inspiration and ideas from 

many people through the years. I would like to acknowledge individually to each person, but 

unfortunately, a few pages would not be enough.   

 

I would like to acknowledge my advisor, Professor Rui Reis, for all the opportunities that he gave 

me. Looking back, after all these years, I can say that he was my best professor. It is because of 

his classes I chose his lab to do my internship. His enthusiasm, motivation, dynamism, youth, and 

strategy influenced my decision to join the 3B´s Research Group a few years ago. He always 

believed in me more than I did. I also thank his support and the opportunity to spend almost one 

year and half abroad without an FCT grant. He also gave me the opportunity to present my work 

and participate in the best conferences of the field and always gave me the necessary freedom to 

guide my research and to explore my ideas. 

 

During my visits to Rice University, USA, Professor Mikos accepted to supervise my work and 

always made all the efforts to make my life there pleasant. I would like to express my sincere 

thanks for his help and crucial guidance. The thoughtful discussions and meetings will be never 

forgotten. These several visits had a remarkable input in my research work and allowed me to 

grow as a scientist. I deeply enjoyed working in Mikos lab. The courteousness and friendly 

environment of the Mikos lab was extremely appreciated. The time that I spent at Rice University 

was the happiest days of my professional life. And I really loved the extremely warm weather of 

Houston. 

I want also to thank Kurt Kasper who helped me in the preparation of protocols and the in vivo 

surgeries. His pertinent suggestions, availability and support revising the manuscripts significantly 

increase their quality. 

To my colleagues and friends at Mikos lab who helped me to feel at home and taught me so 

many things that I needed to know. My several periods abroad were great and successful mainly 

because of you. I want to deeply acknowledge all their attention and friendship, but also for 

holding me up through difficulties mainly when I felt sick and during the Ike hurricane that I was 

without power energy at home for 3 weeks. I will never forget what you did for me in the more 

adverse times.   

 

To my co-advisor and friend Catarina who taught me so much. Your contribution in my life is 

beyond words. I learned how to plan everything in detail and to be organized. Our fruitful 

discussions and scientific plans have been memorable. I am tremendously grateful for your belief 

in me even when I had so many doubts. You are an example of strength and courage. I deeply 

acknowledge your optimism and confidence. You will never know how important you were in 

certain moments of my life. I cannot quantify how many hours we spent together (when we were 



ii 

both in Portugal) or on the phone. We never had a schedule. You always had time!!! I will never 

forget our endless discussions, “blood sessions”, washing hands with EtOH (always!!!), and how 

good Technovit is!!! 

 

Ana M. Martins acknowledges the PhD scholarship from European NoE EXPERTISSUES 

(NMP3-CT-2004-500283) and the funding from the European STREP HIPPOCRATES (NMP3-

CT-2003-505758). 

 

I owe a special debt to who helped me with corrections and thesis formatting.  

 

To my friends that I met in 3B’s but already left. You were so important during the first years in 

the group that I can never describe how grateful I am because of what you have made for me. A 

special thank to Gabi for the wonderful week that we spent together in Philly and NY. That week 

made me feel reborn.  

 

To the GO TEAM, a closest and small group of people that joined together to prepare a huge and 

unforgettable surprise for each member in one of the best days of our lives. Through the years I 

build up a strong relationship with each of you. Thank you for all the wonderful meetings, days, 

dinners, and happy hours.  

 

I need to thank all my closest friends, you know who you are! I must say that I have many special 

people around me. But a special word is addressed to Ana Rita and Rui Pereira. My dearest Ana 

Rita needs to read how important she has been in my life. They have been through these years’ 

unimaginable friends. We have been together in the wonderful and bad times. They have been 

very special friends and they share with me the same values. Thank you for your patience (in this 

last months I almost did not have social life), true opinion, and loyalty. Our friendship is a proof 

that the distance means nothing. Thank you so much my compagnons de route.  

 

To my twin brother, my mother, and my father, this thesis is dedicated to you. I am everything I 

am because I have you. You always have been supporting my dreams, choices, and decisions. 

This thesis would not exist without you. To my dearest nephews, Francisco and Afonso, for the 

asleep company during the writing of this thesis. I was always awake for your each 2 hours meal.

Stimulus Responsive Smart Supports and Scaffold/Cell Constructs for Bone 

Tissue Engineering 

 

ABSTRACT 

Tissue engineering (TE) has emerged as a new interdisciplinary science for the repair of various 

tissues, restoring their functions by means of using biomaterials, cells, and/or bioactive factors. Three 

main general strategies have been adopted for the creation of new bone tissue: i) direct in vivo 

implantation of isolated cells; ii) direct in vivo implantation of scaffolds; and iii) cells placed on or within 

scaffolds. In the bone tissue engineering approach, a temporary scaffold is required to serve as an 

adhesive substrate for the implanted cells and a physical support to guide the formation of the new 

tissue. In the second and third approaches, a porous material acts as a scaffold, serving in the later 

case as transplant vehicle for cultured cells and template to guide tissue regeneration, playing an 

important role in transforming the cell seeded scaffolds in to a new tissue. 

The present thesis is divided in two main groups of studies: in the first one we describe the TE 

strategy of using scaffold and seeded cells with osteogenic media supplemented with several 

enzymes (Chapter III and IV). The second part describes the development of acellular scaffolds with in 

situ pore forming ability in vitro, improvement of their properties (namely degradation and 

osteoconductivity) and finally the validation of in situ pore forming concept in vivo (Chapters V, VI, VII 

and VIII).  

Previously, it was demonstrated that starch/poly(?-caprolactone) fiber mesh scaffolds have induced 

osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) when cultured in flow perfusion 

bioreactors. The studies described in Chapters III and IV aimed to investigate the effect of complete 

osteogenic media supplemented with different enzymes in physiological concentrations similar to 

those found in human serum. The influence of these enzymes on the degradation of SPCL fiber 

meshes and on the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs seeded onto scaffolds was assessed. These 

studies were performed in static cultures and in flow perfusion bioreactors. After degradation studies in 

static and dynamic conditions in the presence of enzymes showed that SPCL did not lose its structural 

integrity. ?-amylase had a remarkable effect on the degradation, increasing porosity and pore size of 

SPCL in both static and dynamic conditions. It was demonstrated that supplementation of culture 

media with lipase enhances the osteoblastic differentiation of the seeded MSCs and promotes matrix 

mineralization in static cultures. When flow perfusion bioreactors were used, the flow enhanced the 

infiltration of cells and facilitated better distribution of extracellular matrix throughout the scaffolds in 

the presence/absence of enzymes. The presence of flow and lipase improved the osteogenic 

differentiation of MSCs as compared with the other groups, enhanced mineralization and promoted 

uniform matrix distribution. 

The second part of this thesis (Chapters V, VI, VII and VIII) described the development of almost non-

porous chitosan and chitosan/starch scaffolds, with the ability of forming a porous structure in situ due 

to the attack by specific enzymes present in the human body (?-amylase and lysozyme). The results 

of the compressive tests showed that these scaffolds exhibit very good mechanical properties in both 

the dry and wet state. Degradation studies were performed using ?-amylase and/or lysozyme at 



iv 

concentrations similar to those found in human serum and showed that after enzymatic degradation 

there was the formation of a porous structure, indicating the potential of this methodology to obtain in 

situ forming scaffolds. Citotoxicity test revealed that the extracts of the materials were clearly non-toxic 

to L929 fibroblast cells. Analysis of cell adhesion and morphology of seeded osteoblastic-like cells in 

direct contact tests showed that the number of cells on chitosan/starch scaffolds was noticeably higher 

than that on chitosan scaffolds, which suggest that starch containing materials may promote cell 

adhesion and proliferation. 

In order to improve the in situ pore forming scaffolds, a self-regulated degrading material with gradual 

in situ pore formation were developed. This approach is based on the incorporation of the lysozyme 

enzyme into biomimetic calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings. These coatings were prepared on the 

surface of chitosan scaffolds by means of a biomimetic coating technique, with the aim of controlling 

their degradation rate and preventing infection upon implantation. Two different environments were 

simulated: normal physiological conditions (pH 7.4) and inflammatory response (pH 5). At pH 7.4, the 

scaffolds remained more stable than those incubated at pH 5, which showed a rapid decrease in their 

initial weight and the formation of a highly porous structure.  

Additional studies investigated the influence of a CaP biomimetic coating on osteogenic differentiation 

of rat marrow stromal cells (MSCs) and showed enhanced differentiation of rat MSCs seeded on the 

CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds with lysozyme incorporated. At all culture times, CaP coated 

chitosan-based scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme enhanced osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs, 

bone matrix production, and mineralization. The ability of these CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds 

with incorporated lysozyme to create an interconnected pore network in situ coupled with its positive 

effect on osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs and the production of mineralized matrix illustrate the 

strong potential of these scaffolds for application in bone tissue engineering strategies. 

In order to validate the concept in vivo, a rat subcutaneous model was used to investigate the 

degradation of the scaffolds and the in situ pore formation. All scaffolds showed pronounced weight 

loss and pore formation as a function of time. All group conditions showed a significant increase in 

porosity after 12 weeks. After all time points no adverse tissue reaction was observed, and as 

degradation increased, histological analysis showed cells ingrowth throughout the implants. Using this 

innovative methodology, the ability of gradual in situ pore formation of these novel scaffolds was 

demonstrated in vivo.  

As a concluding remark, it can be stated that the studies performed in this thesis proposed several 

successful strategies that might find application in a bone tissue engineering scenario.

Suportes Inteligentes com Capacidade de Responder a Estímulos e Novas 

Combinações Suportes/Células para Engenharia de Tecidos Ósseos 

 

RESUMO 

A Engenharia de Tecidos é uma ciência interdisciplinar recente que visa reparar diferentes tecidos, 

recuperando as suas funções usando biomateriais, células e/ou agentes bioactivos. As três 

estratégias que têm sido usadas para a criação de novo tecido ósseo incluem: i) implantação de 

células; ii) implantação de suportes tridimensionais; e iii) combinação das duas estratégias anteriores, 

usando células cultivadas nos suportes. Na engenharia de tecidos ósseos, os suportes são usados 

como substrato para células e também como suporte físico para as mesmas de forma a induzir a 

formação de novo tecido ósseo. Na segunda e terceira estratégias, descritas anteriormente, um 

material poroso funciona como suporte para cultura de células e para induzir a regeneração óssea, 

tendo um papel importante na diferenciação de células no tecido desejado. 

Esta tese divide-se em dois estudos principais: o primeiro que descreve a estratégia de engenharia 

de tecidos utilizando um suporte poroso e células cultivadas no mesmo, usando meio osteogénico 

enriquecido com diferentes enzimas (Capítulos III e IV). A segunda parte desta tese descreve o 

desenvolvimento de suportes não porosos com a capacidade de formação de poros in situ, 

aperfeiçoamento das suas propriedades (nomeadamente no que respeita a degradação e 

osteoconductividade) e por último, a confirmação do conceito de formação de poros in situ nos 

suportes inteligentes quando implantados in vivo (Capítulos V, VI, VII e VIII). 

Os estudos apresentados nos Capítulos IIII e IV tiveram como objectivo investigar o efeito do meio 

osteogénico enriquecido com diferentes enzimas em concentrações fisiológicas semelhantes às 

encontradas no soro humano. Estudou-se a influência destas enzimas na degradação de suportes 

porosos à base de amido e policaprolactona (SPCL) e na diferenciação osteogénica de células da 

medula óssea de rato. Estes estudos foram efectuados em condições estáticas e usando bioreactores 

de perfusão. Os estudos de degradação em condições estáticas e dinâmicas mostraram que na 

presença das enzimas, os suportes de SPCL não perderam a sua estrutura física. A ?-amilase teve 

um efeito significativo na degradação dos suportes de SPCL, aumentando a sua porosidade e o 

tamanho de poros em condições estáticas e dinâmicas. Demonstrou-se também que a lipase no meio 

osteogénico melhorou a diferenciação osteogénica das células cultivadas nos suportes de SPCL e 

estimulou a mineralização da matriz extracelular em condições estáticas. Quando foram usados 

bioreactores de perfusão, verificou-se que o fluxo melhorou a infiltração das células e permitiu uma 

melhor distribuição de matriz extracelular no interior dos suportes. A combinação do fluxo (gerado 

pelos bioreactores) e a presença de lipase permitiram obter melhores resultados no que respeita a 

diferenciação osteogénica das células da medula óssea em todos os grupos estudados, induzindo 

mais mineralização e distribuição da matriz extracelular. 

A segunda parte desta tese (Capítulos V, VI, VII and VIII) descreve o desenvolvimento de suportes 

não porosos à base de quitosano e combinação de quitosano com amido, com a capacidade de 

formarem uma estrutura porosa in situ devido à acção de enzimas específicas (?-amilase e lisozima – 

enzimas existentes no corpo humano). Os resultados dos estudos de compressão mostraram que 



vi 

estes suportes têm propriedades mecânicas adequadas quando estudados nos estados seco e 

molhado.  

Os estudos de degradação foram efectuados usando ?-amilase e/ou lisozima em concentrações 

semelhantes às encontradas no soro humano e mostraram que induziram a formação de uma 

estrutura porosa, demonstrando o potencial destes suportes inteligentes com capacidade para 

responder a estímulos. Os testes de citotoxicidade com fibroblastos L929 mostraram a ausência de 

toxicidade dos extractos dos materiais. Os testes de contacto directo com uma linha celular de 

osteoblastos mostraram que o número de células nos suportes à base de quitosano e amido era 

maior do que nos suportes de quitosano, sugerindo que o amido pode promover a adesão e 

proliferação celular. 

Desenvolveram-se suportes inteligentes com capacidade de responder a estímulos de forma a 

melhorar o comportamento dos suportes com capacidade de formação de poros in situ. Esta 

estratégia incluiu a incorporação de lisozima em revestimentos de fosfato de cálcio na superfície de 

suportes de quitosano usando a técnica de revestimentos biomiméticos com o objectivo de controlar a 

degradação dos suportes e prevenir infecções. Foram simuladas duas condições: condições 

fisiológicas normais (pH 7.4) e de resposta inflamatória (pH 5). A pH 7.4, os suportes mantiveram-se 

estáveis comparativamente aos estudados a pH 5, que mostraram um decréscimo de peso e a 

formação de estruturas porosas. 

Estudos adicionais investigaram a influência dos revestimentos de fosfato de cálcio na diferenciação 

osteogénica de células da medula óssea e mostraram que estas diferenciaram-se na presença de 

lisozima. Em todos os tempos de cultura observou-se que os suportes de quitosano revestidos com 

fosfatos de cálcio e na presença de lisozima tiveram um melhor comportamento do que os restantes 

grupos estudados, nomeadamente na produção e mineralização da matriz extracelular. A capacidade 

destes suportes inteligentes em responder a estímulos e formar estruturas porosas, juntamente com o 

efeito positivo na diferenciação osteogénica de células da medula óssea, ilustram o potencial destes 

suportes para aplicações na área de engenharia de tecidos ósseos. 

Por último, pretendeu-se confirmar o conceito de formação de poros in vivo. Diferentes tipos de 

suportes à base de quitosano e amido, revestidos ou não com fosfatos de cálcio e na 

presença/ausência de lisozima foram implantados em ratos usando um modelo subcutâneo. Os 

principais objectivos incluíram o estudo da degradação in vivo dos suportes e a formação de poros in 

situ. Todos os suportes apresentaram elevada perda de peso e formação de poros em função do 

tempo de implantação. Adicionalmente, todos os grupos mostram um aumento significativo na sua 

porosidade após 12 semanas. Em todos os tempos de implantação não foram detectadas reacções 

adversas e, conforme a degradação aumentou, as secções histológicas mostraram infiltração de 

células nos implantes. Esta metodologia inovadora mostrou a capacidade destes suportes inteligentes 

em responder a estímulos e deste modo serem capazes de induzir per se a formação de estruturas 

porosas. 

As observações discutidas nesta tese propõem diferentes estratégias que poderão ser usadas com 

sucesso na área de engenharia de tecidos ósseos.

INTRODUCTION TO THE THESIS FORMAT 
 
This thesis is divided in five sections containing nine chapters, with six of them 

experimental. The contents of each section are summarized below. 

 

SECTION 1 (Chapter I) 

In the first part (Part I) it is discussed the preparation of naturally derived scaffolds of 

polysaccharide origin, the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells cultured on 

biomimetic calcium phosphate coatings, and the delivery of biomolecules associated with 

ECM mineralization. The second part (Part II) gives an overview of strategies that can 

modulate bone tissue regeneration by using naturally derived in situ-forming scaffolds. 

 

SECTION 2 (Chapter II) 

Chapter II contains the materials and experimental procedures used within the scope of 

this thesis, detailing what is included in the manuscripts that compose the results sections. 

 

SECTION 3 (Chapter III and IV) consists of two chapters of experimental work. 

Chapters III and IV describes the studies using starch/ poly(?-caprolactone) fiber mesh 

scaffolds and osteogenic culture media supplemented with ?-amylase and/or lipase in static 

cultures and flow perfusion bioreactors using rat bone marrow stromal cells. Degradation 

studies with ?-amylase or lipase were also performed in static and dynamic conditions. 

 

SECTION 4 (Chapters V, VI, VII and VIII) consists of four chapters of experimental 

work. 

Chapter V describes the development of several scaffolds formulations based on chitosan 

and starch with the ability of forming a porous structure in situ due to the attack of specific 

enzymes present in the human body (?-amylase and lysozyme). Compressive analysis, 

degradation studies with ?-amylase and/or lysozyme at concentrations similar to those 

found in human serum, extracts tests with L929 cells and direct contact tests with 

osteoblast-like cells were performed. 

 

Chapter VI describes an innovative self-regulated degrading material with gradual in situ 

pore formation ability for bone tissue engineering applications. In this work, lysozyme was 

incorporated into calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings, on the surface of chitosan scaffolds 

using biomimetic coating technique, with the aim of controlling their degradation rate, 

subsequent formation of pores and to prevent infection upon implantation. To prove the 

concept of in situ pore formation, the coated scaffolds (with and without lysozyme) were 

incubated in two different solutions at different pHs to simulate normal physiological 

conditions (pH 7.4) and inflammatory response (pH 5).

Chapter VII reports the use of CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds with incorporated 

lysozyme. This study was designed in order to assess the influence of lysozyme on the 

formation of pores in chitosan scaffolds, using a similar concentration to the one 

incorporated into CaP coatings. Additional studies investigated the influence of a CaP 

biomimetic coating and lysozyme on osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal 

cells. 

 

Chapter VIII presents the final experimental study performed for this thesis. This last study 

intends to validate the concept of in situ pore forming in vivo using a rat subcutaneous 

model. It was investigated the degradation of the scaffolds in vivo and the in situ formation 

of pores. 

 

SECTION 5 (Chapter IX)  

Chapter IX contains the general conclusions and final remarks regarding the overall work 

carried out under the scope of this thesis.

ABSTRACT 

Tissue engineering has emerged as a new interdisciplinary field for the repair of 

various tissues, restoring their functions by using scaffolds, cells, and/or bioactive factors. A 

temporary scaffold acts as an extracellular matrix (ECM) analog to culture cells and guide the 

development of new tissue. In this chapter, we discuss the preparation of naturally derived 

scaffolds of polysaccharide origin, the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells 

(MSCs) cultured on biomimetic calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings, and the delivery of 

biomolecules associated with extracellular matrix mineralization.

CHAPTER I. Introduction

1. INTRODUCTION 

Bone is a dynamic, highly vascularized tissue with a unique capacity to heal and 

remodel without leaving a scar. It is the structural framework of the body and is composed of 

an inorganic mineral phase of hydroxyapatite and an organic phase of mainly type I collagen. 

Bone continuously resorbs and reforms in a remodeling process that is carried out by two 

types of bone cells: the bone-building osteoblasts and the bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Slowly 

and insidiously, bone deteriorates, losing minerals and structure. Bone injuries produced as a 

result of disease and/or trauma present a major health concern. A fracture, usually of the hip, 

wrist, or a vertebra, is often the first indication that osteoporosis has been weakening the 

bones of a patient for years (1). Treatment options include transplantation, surgical repair, 

prostheses, mechanical devices, and drug therapy (2). However, major damage to a tissue 

or organ can neither be repaired nor long-term recovery effected in a truly satisfactory way 

using these methods.  

In this context, an emerging field of science termed “tissue engineering,” defined as 

an “interdisciplinary field that applies the principles of engineering and life sciences toward 

the development of biological substitutes that restore, maintain, or improve tissue function” 

(3) has been gaining significant recognition. Tissue engineering uses organ-specific cells for 

seeding a scaffold ex vivo, however it may also involve the implantation of an acellular 

construct for guided tissue regeneration (4).  Indeed, a wide range of strategies exist for 

tissue engineering in general, and bone tissue engineering specifically.  

Bone tissue engineering is a rapidly expanding field, full of innovative ideas for 

treating bone trauma and pathologies. Selection of the most appropriate material to produce 

a scaffold in bone related applications is a very important step toward the construction of a 

tissue engineered construct. There is an increasing interest in the production of novel 

scaffolds from renewable resources. Natural polymers are an attractive alternative to 

synthetic polymers for various clinical applications partly due to their biocompatibility and 

also because they are typically biodegraded by “normal” and/or enzymatic hydrolysis (carried 

out, in the majority of cases, by specific enzymes also present in the human body). Some of 

the advantages associated with naturally derived biomaterials are their cost effectiveness as 

well as the wide range of properties and structures attainable with these materials. A large 

number of different naturally derived biomaterials have been studied and proposed for bone 

tissue engineering applications, namely polysaccharides (chitosan, starch, alginate, 

hyaluronic acid, and cellulose, among others) and proteins (soy, collagen, fibrin). 

Polysaccharides, in particular, have some attractive properties, such as nontoxicity (pertinent 

monomer residues are not hazardous to health), high swelling ability and stability over a 

range of pH values.  



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

 

7 

For successful bone replacement, the ideal scaffold should be biocompatible (5-8) 

with the surrounding biological fluids and tissues to avoid any detrimental tissue response. 

The scaffolding material should degrade into nontoxic residues that can be easily removed 

from the body through normal excretion processes (5, 6, 8, 9). The scaffolds serve as 

temporary substrates for living cells as well as physical supports for tissue regeneration (10). 

Adequate surface area and appropriate surface energy are also needed to permit cell 

adhesion, promote cell proliferation, and allow retention of differentiated cell functions (5-8, 

10). In addition, sufficient mechanical stability of the scaffold is necessary to maintain the 

desired shape and structure during cell culture in vitro and transplantation in vivo. Control of 

scaffold pore morphology is critical for controlling cell colonization rates and maintaining 

transport of oxygen, nutrients, and metabolic waste, as well as for supporting organization of 

the engineered tissue. Furthermore, angiogenesis, a requirement for survival and success of 

vascularized tissues, can be affected by the porosity of the scaffold. Pore morphology can 

also be expected to significantly affect scaffold degradation kinetics and the mechanical 

properties of the developing tissue (6, 11). 

The scaffolds used for tissue engineering purposes mimic the extracellular matrix 

(ECM) of the regenerating bone environment. Thus, in addition to serving as a mechanical 

support, a tissue engineering scaffold may also be “informative” to the cells. An ideal three-

dimensional construct for bone tissue engineering, above all discussed pertinent 

characteristics, should be simultaneously osteoinductive (capable of recruiting 

osteoprogenitor cells and stimulating their differentiation down the bone-forming cell lineage), 

osteoconductive (capable of supporting the formation of bone at the surface of the scaffold), 

and also resorbable and amenable to gradual replacement by newly formed bone (12). In the 

medical field, consideration of biodegradation is a priority on the list of safety standards when 

choosing polymers as potential biomaterials for tissue engineering applications. Naturally 

derived materials have recently gained interest, as they are structurally similar to the native 

extracellular matrix of many tissues; exhibit excellent biocompatibility; and induce minimal 

inflammatory response and tissue damage. Natural polymers may present a biologically 

active environment to the cells, since they usually contain domains that provide cues and can 

send important signals to guide cells at various stages of development (10). 

A method to potentially increase the biological activity of a bone tissue engineering 

scaffold is to coat the surface of the scaffold with calcium phosphate.  One of the main goals 

of calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings on bone tissue engineering scaffolds is to promote 

osteoconduction and by enhancing adhesion of osteogenic cells and ingrowth of bone into 

biomaterials (13). New technologies have been developed to promote osteogenic activity of 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

8 

bone tissue engineering scaffolds. These approaches tend to integrate into the coatings 

osteoinductive or bioactive agents (e. g., enzymes and antibiotics), to immobilize 

constitutional elements of bone (e.g., growth factors including bone morphogenetic proteins 

[BMPs] and other members of the transforming growth factor [TGF]-? superfamily, adhesion 

proteins (e.g., collagen, fibronectin, laminin, and vitronectin) and peptides (e.g., the arginine-

glycine-aspartic acid [RGD] sequences) on the surface of biomaterials. Immobilization and/or 

delivery of bioactive molecules at specific sites have been exploited to enhance cell 

adhesion, differentiation, and other cell functions as well as to promote mineralization of the 

ECM of the tissue engineered bone constructs. 

 

2. SCAFFOLDS OF NATURAL ORIGIN – POLYSACCHARIDES 

A large number of natural polymers, including polysaccharides, have been suggested 

as candidates for the production of scaffolds for bone tissue engineering purposes. 

Polysaccharides are relatively complex carbohydrates. They are high molecular weight 

polymers having one or more monosaccharide repeating units joined together by glycosidic 

bonds. Polysaccharides tend to be amorphous and insoluble in water. Some of the main 

advantages associated with this class of polymers are wide availability, cost effectiveness, 

good hemocompatibility (probably because of their similarities with heparin), nontoxicity, and 

a wide range of properties and structures suitable for biomedical applications. These 

polymers have been proposed as scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications as well 

as carriers for cells and bioactive molecules (e.g., proteins, enzymes, and growth factors) for 

controlled release systems.  

Chitosan, starch and alginate, three examples of polysaccharide materials, will be 

described in detail in the sections that follow. 

 

2.1. Chitosan 

Chitosan, a naturally derived polymer, is a partially deacetylated derivative of chitin, 

found in crustacea exoskeletons (e.g., shrimp, crab, and lobster), cell walls of fungi, and 

cuticles of insects (14, 15). Depending on the source and preparation procedure, the 

molecular weight of chitosan may range from 300 to more than 1,000 kDa (11). Chitosan is a 

suitable functional biomaterial because it is biocompatible, biodegradable, minimally 

immunogenic, nontoxic, and hydrophilic. Moreover, it has adsorption properties with 

remarkable affinity for proteins, and is not expensive (16-21). Some studies report that 

chitosan enhanced osteogenesis (22-24) and improved wound healing (25, 26). In addition, 

chitosan is a hemostatic agent (11, 16), with antithrombogenic properties (27). It has proved 

to be a useful excipient in various drug delivery systems due to its nontoxicity, high cohesive

and hydrophilic properties, and polycationic character resulting from primary amine groups, 

which provide a high charge density in acidic solutions (pH &amp;lt;6.5) (18, 28). It is soluble in 

dilute or weak acids (such as acetic and formic acid), but it is normally insoluble in aqueous 

solutions above pH 6.5. 

Chitosan is a binary polyheterosaccharide of N-acetylglucosamine and glucosamine 

with a ?1?4 linkage. The superior tissue compatibility of chitosan can be partially attributed 

to its structural similarity to glycosaminoglycans, which are major components of the ECM of 

bone and cartilage (15, 29). Chitosan is easily hydrolyzed by various chitosanases (30), 

which are completely absent in mammals, and is biodegraded in the presence of lysozyme in 

aqueous medium in vitro (17, 31-35); this degradation process depends on the degree of 

deacetylation (31), which represents the proportion of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units with 

respect to the total number of units (30). Chitosan degradation kinetics are inversely related 

to the degree of deacetylation (31, 32). In vitro and in vivo, chitosan is degraded by 

enzymatic hydrolysis; the primary agent of this process is lysozyme, which targets acetylated 

residues (36). Chitosan and glucosamine, its biodegradation product, are not toxic in vivo 

(37). Lysozyme, or muramidase, is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the 

peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls (38). This enzyme is active over a broad pH range 

(from 3 to 8) and hydrolyzes its substrates both inside and outside cells. Lysozyme is widely 

distributed in the human body (39). It is found to occur in the nose the bronchus, bronchiole, 

middle ear, lacrimal gland, bone marrow and digestive tract (16), and in lymphocytes; 

lysozyme is also secreted by monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes, which are the 

largest source of the enzyme (40, 41). Monocytes and macrophages are the primary 

contributors to the lysozyme content in human serum (41); the concentration in serum is in 

the range of 7 to 13 mg/L (39). The susceptibility of chitosan to degradation induced by 

lysozyme make the protein an attractive target for incorporation into this biodegradable 

material (29, 42-44).  

Incorporation of active biomolecules, such as growth factors, has been used as a 

highly beneficial strategy for improving bone regeneration in tissue engineering applications. 

The biological activity of chitosan on bone regeneration has been confirmed in many studies 

(18, 45). Chitosan can be easily fabricated into bulk porous scaffolds, films, microparticles, 

sponges and beads. The feasibility of forming porous scaffolds permits wide application of 

this polymer in tissue engineering. This is mainly true for bone tissue engineering 

applications, because chitosan supports osteoblast proliferation and phenotypic expression 

(15). Chitosan fiber meshes with appropriate mechanical properties, developed by 

Tuzlakoglu et al. (46) exhibited bioactivity; this is very important aspect for biomaterials used 

as bone tissue engineering scaffolds. Martins et al. (35) proposed the development of 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

10 

chitosan-based scaffolds with the capability of forming porous structures in situ following 

attack by specific enzymes (namely, ?-amylase and lysozyme) present in the human body. In 

addition to the capability of forming pores in situ, other advantages these scaffolds have 

when compared with other conventional materials are their suitable mechanical properties 

and lack of toxicity. Coutinho et al. (47) studied the function of an osteoblastic-like cell line 

(SaOs-2) on chitosan blends with synthetic biodegradable polymers, and reported enhanced 

osteoblastic activity. Costa-Pinto et al. (48) formulated scaffolds based on blends of chitosan 

and synthetic polyesters, and provided evidence that these scaffolds are cytocompatible. 

Furthermore, chitosan-based scaffolds promoted the attachment and proliferation of mouse 

mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (48), which exhibited high levels of alkaline phosphatase 

activity and produced a mineralized ECM (48). 

 

2.2. Starch 

Starch is one of the most abundant naturally occurring polymers with properties that 

make it attractive for several biomedical applications. Starch is found as insoluble granules of 

?-amylose (20-30%) and amylopectin (70-80%) (49). Amylopectin polymers are highly 

branched structures containing (1?4)-?-D-glucose and (1?6)-?-D-glucose linkages, 

whereas amylose is much more linear with long stretches of (1?4)-?-D-glucose-linked 

monomer units. Starch is extremely difficult to process and is brittle when used without the 

addition of a plasticizer (49). Over the years, several other materials have been blended with 

starch to improve its processability, including several synthetic (50-54) and natural polymers, 

such as polysaccharides (35, 55) and proteins (56). Reis and co-workers (35, 57-70) have 

proposed use of starch-based scaffolds for biomedical applications. Starch exhibits low 

toxicity (35, 64), biodegradability (35, 70-72), and biocompatibility (73-75), which are 

excellent characteristics for bone tissue engineering applications. Compared with other 

biodegradable polymers, starch is inexpensive, and above all, reusable. Specific enzymes 

present in the human body, namely ?-amylase in the blood plasma, can easily degrade 

starch. The main enzymes involved in starch degradation are ?-amylases, ?-amylases, ?-

glucosidases, and other debranching enzymes. 

 An important consideration of biodegradable materials of natural origin being 

considered for use in the biomedical field is the host response to the degradation products. 

Starch degradation products are oligosaccharides that can be metabolized to produce 

energy. Due to their degradation by ?-amylases, this constitutes another strategy to control 

and tailor the degradation of starch-based scaffolds. Martins et al. (35) developed a novel 

biodegradable matrix based on chitosan and starch, with the ability of forming a porous 

structure in situ following attack by specific enzymes (namely, ?-amylase and lysozyme) 

present in the human body. These researchers showed that pore size and distribution in the 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

 

11 

chitosan matrix is controlled by the location of the ‘‘sacrificial’’ phase (i.e., native starch) that 

is enzymatically degradaded (35). This same study reported an interesting approach for the 

control of matrix degradation in situ and consequent pore formation, which could result in 

scaffolds with mechanical properties appropriate for the initial stage of implantation (35). 

Martins and co-workers (76) also studied the influence of ?-amylase on the degradation of 

fiber mesh scaffolds based on a blend of starch and poly(?-caprolactone) (SPCL) and 

demonstrated enhanced scaffold porosity and pore size and decreased average fiber 

diameter with time. Furthermore, culture of rat marrow stromal cells on SPCL fiber meshes 

(in medium supplemented with ?-amylase) resulted in enhanced cell proliferation (76). 

 

2.3. Alginate 

Alginate (alginic acid or algin) is a linear polyuronate containing D-mannuronic acid 

and L-guluronic acid that is abundant in the cell walls of brown algae. Due to the 

biocompatibility and gelation of alginate with certain divalent cations, it is widely used for cell 

immobilization and encapsulation. Alginate is soluble in aqueous solutions at room 

temperature and forms stable gels in the presence of calcium, barium, and strontium without 

chemical crosslinking agents (77); for this reason, the viability and biological activity of 

entrapped cells and biochemical agents are maintained in alginate gels. As a biomaterial, 

alginate has a number of advantages including biocompatibility and nonimmunogenicity, 

which are related to its hydrophilicity (78, 79).  

Several studies examined alginate sponges as scaffolds for tissue engineering 

applications (78) and reported that their structural and morphological properties are 

appropriate for cell culture and proliferation as well as for neovascularization (78). Other 

studies reported that alginate supports synthesis of pertinent ECM components by various 

cell types, and provides an amenable environment for cell encapsulation, drug delivery, and 

gene delivery (80). Alginate also permits the cotransplantation of multiple cell types and 

appropriate growth stimuli to promote, for example, the osteogenic phenotype (81). 

Encapsulated bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were studied for the purpose of healing 

bone defects in orthopedics (82). Studies with gels containing MSCs and alginate beads 

loaded with vancomycin (a treatment for bone infections), reported that bone marrow-derived 

MSCs proliferated and expressed alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin, and type I collagen 

genes (83). Cai et al. (84) reported expression of bone specific ECM markers when they 

examined the ectopic bone forming ability of BMSc in combination with scaffolds made from 

alginate gel and implanted subcutaneously in nude mice for 8 weeks. Moreover, hydrogels 

such as alginate are effective cell substrates for both two dimensional (2D) (85) and 3D (78, 

85) cell cultures, indicating the suitability of alginate for tissue engineering applications.

 3. CaP BIOMIMETIC COATINGS 

Ideally, tissue engineering scaffolds should mimic, to the greatest degree possible, 

the properties of the native target tissue in an effort to promote, direct, and control 

regeneration of a specific, desired type of tissue. The term “biomimetics” is used to describe 

a branch of science that seeks to produce such “bioinspired” materials for a variety of 

applications.  

Compared with other biomaterals, CaPs have a unique characteristic for bone 

mimicry and substitution. Their composition resembles that of bone mineral; most 

importantly, they can induce a biological response similar to that generated during bone 

remodeling, which involves resorption and formation of new bone tissue (86). Osteoclasts 

are responsible for bone mineral degradation, resulting in bone resorption (86). During bone 

resorption, the degradation products of CaP (calcium and phosphate ions) are naturally 

metabolized but do not cause abnormally increased calcium and phosphate levels in urine, 

serum, or organs (87). It should be noted that osteoclasts degrade CaP in a similar fashion 

as they degrade natural bone (88-90). 

In 1972 Hench et al. (91) showed that “Bioglass” (that is, glass in the Na2O-CaO-

SiO2-P2O5 system), spontaneously bonded to living bone without formation of surrounding 

fibrous tissue. In the early 1990s, Kokubo and co-workers (92, 93) proposed that the 

essential requirement for a biomaterial to bond to living bone is the formation of bone-like 

apatite on the surface of the biomaterial when implanted in vivo. This in vivo apatite 

formation can be reproduced in vitro using a simulated body fluid (SBF), which is a solution 

containing inorganic ion concentrations similar to those of human extracellular fluids but 

without any cells or proteins (94). Under such in vitro conditions, the formed layer consists of 

carbonate apatite with small crystallites and low crystallinity (94). This apatite is referred to 

as “bone-like apatite” due to its similarity to apatite present in natural bone.  

Biomimetic methodology for coating biomaterials with a bone-like apatite layer has 

been described in several publications (92, 95-98). This technique mimics the natural 

biomineralization processes, which involve controlled crystal phase nucleation and growth. 

The main advantage of the biomimetic methodology is the use of physiological conditions 

(pH 7.4 at 37ºC) simulating the conditions under which apatite is formed in bone. Moreover, 

this technique allows the incorporation of proteins and bioactive agents without 

compromising the activity of the agents (96, 98-101). In 1997, Reis et al. (95) adapted the 

methodology developed by Kokubo and used bioactive glass as a precursor of the nucleation 

and growth of CaP films on starch-based polymers. Briefly, for the preparation of the 

biomimetic CaP coatings based on the methodology previously developed by Abe et al. (92) 

and Kokubo (93) and adapted by Reis et al. (95), the materials under consideration were first 

impregnated with bioactive glass, and were then immersed in simulated body fluid (1.0 SBF) 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

 

13 

solution for several days at 37ºC; this phase is known as the “nucleation stage” and allows 

formation of CaP nuclei. In order to accelerate apatite formation, the biomaterials were 

subsequently immersed at 37ºC in simulated body fluid solution (1.5 SBF) with an ionic 

concentration 1.5-fold greater than physiological; this condition enhances CaP nuclei growth. 

The CaP biomimetic coatings, which are thus formed, exhibit osteoconductive properties that 

will be discussed later in this chapter. 

 

3.1. Osteoconductivity 

Scaffolds for bone tissue engineering should be osteoconductive; that is, able to 

support the formation of bone within and/or upon the scaffold. Osteoconductivity has been 

observed when porous structures were implanted into or adjacent to bone. In such cases, 

osteoprogenitor cells migrated into pores and filled the porous structure with newly formed 

bone. This process is characterized by an initial ingrowth of fibrovascular tissue that invades 

the porous structure followed by later development of new bone directly within it (102). 

Hydroxyapatite-based materials are osteoconductive, provided that fully differentiated 

osteogenic cells are available at the site of implantation (12). Adsorption of growth factors 

from the local milieu and from the blood circulation contributes to the osteoconductivity of 

hydroxyapatite by creating suitable conditions for bone formation when implanted in an 

osseous environment in vivo. Many relatively insoluble CaP materials are osteoconductive, 

and, in some cases, may induce extraskeletal new bone formation (i.e., they are 

osteoinductive). 

 

3.2. Osteoinductivity 

Osteoinduction is the process by which stem and osteoprogenitor cells are recruited 

to the bone healing site and stimulated to undergo osteogenic differentiation (103). 

Osteoinductivity implies the ability of chemical compounds to induce osteogenic 

differentiation of uncommitted progenitor cells (12). It has been proposed that biomaterials do 

not have an osteoinductive character in the absence of appropriate osteoinductive agents, 

such as certain BMPs and other bioactive molecules (104). However, several studies have 

reported that some CaP biomaterials (105-107), namely CaP coatings (107, 108), may be 

osteoinductive. These CaP biomaterials may induce bone formation at extraskeletal sites 

without addition of osteogenic cells or bioactive agents. Hydroxyapatite is not osteoinductive 

because it cannot induce osteogenic differentiation of progenitor cells when implanted in a 

nonosseous environment, such as skin and muscle (12).  

 

 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

14 

3.3. Incorporation of biomolecules into CaP biomimetic coatings  

Numerous attempts have been made to improve the osteoconductivity of 

biomaterials. Coatings of CaP expedite osteoconduction and bone ingrowth at the surface of 

bone substitutes and, therefore, are useful strategies in tissue engineering endeavors for the 

regeneration of bone tissue. However, a methodology that enables regeneration of bone 

tissue should not only expedite osteoconduction, but also osteoinduction through 

biochemical pathways (109-112). It is known that BMPs can be incorporated into CaP 

implants (with adequate 3D geometry) to promote osteogenesis (112, 113); the surface of 

such implants, however, will be rapidly conditioned by several highly concentrated molecules 

(114). For this reason, other types of delivery-specific approaches have been investigated as 

alternatives that further functionalize and enhance the potential of CaP coatings. Specifically, 

the CaP biomimetic coatings have been used as a carrier of molecules including 

osteoinductive agents such as BMPs (115-117), other proteins (101, 118, 119, 120), 

enzymes (96, 98, 121), and antibiotics (122, 123).  

Biomimetic CaP coatings, produced as described in early parts of this chapter, are 

deposited onto surfaces under physiological temperature and pH (110), enabling the 

coprecipitation and consequent incorporation of biologically active molecules (99). This 

approach circumvents difficulties common to plasma spraying techniques. By using low 

temperatures, biomimetic processes can be applied not only to highly resistant materials 

(e.g., metallic alloys) but also to polymeric and naturally derived implants (e.g., chitosan, 

starch, and collagen) for implantation (124).  

The major objective of CaP coating is to provide appropriate biological composition 

and to improve the quality of the surfaces of various materials used for orthopedic 

applications. The conditions under which such a coating is prepared affects conformational 

stability of incorporated biomolecules, and thus the bioactivity and shelf-life of the final 

product. Such coatings, which are structurally and chemically comparable to the mineral 

component of bone, can possess favorable bioactive properties that may facilitate outcomes 

in cases of critical clinical need (122, 125). 

This alternative coating technique may be used to produce systems with several 

advantages, such as reduction of burst release of incorporated molecules into the biological 

milieu. In this case, biomolecules incorporated in the inorganic phase are gradually released 

as the latticework undergoes degradation. The advent of the slow degradation of the coating 

modulates delivery of bioactive agents. Slow release of these chemical compounds may 

improve the osteoinductive capacity of the implant material (100, 126). 

One of the potential applications of CaP coatings relates to the incorporation of 

bioactive agents and proteins. Azevedo et al. (121) used a biomimetic technique pertains to 

incorporate of bovine serum albumin and ?-amylase into a CaP coating on the surface of a 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

 

15 

starch-based polymer. In that study, the properties of resultant biomaterial were tailored by 

judicious choice of specific enzymes and their incorporation at different compositions and 

combinations into CaP coatings that retained their bioactivity (121). Efficient incorporation of 

active ?-amylase into biomimetic coatings controlled the degradation rate of starch-based 

biomaterials. Similar results and applications were achieved with chitosan scaffolds after the 

incorporation of lysozyme (96, 98). Martins et al. (96, 98) incorporated lysozyme on the 

surface of chitosan scaffolds in order to control the degradation rate of chitosan and 

subsequent formation of pores. Furthermore, since lysozyme has antibacterial properties, 

these coatings may be used as a carrier for its sustained release, potentially mitigating 

infection at the implantation site. Several studies reported in the literature addressed 

incorporation of BMPs into biomimetic CaP layers (110, 116, 125, 127). These studies 

indicated that CaP coatings have the potential for sustained delivery of many other bioactive 

agents. Liu and co-workers (99) demonstrated that BMP-2 retained its osteoinductivity when 

delivered from biomimetic systems and that the osteoconductivity of implant material 

surfaces was affected by BMP-2 and its delivery mode (125).  

In summary, the results discussed in this section support the strategy of adding 

osteoinductive signaling molecules into CaP biomimetic coatings for the purpose of inducing 

bone growth. 

  

4. OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION OF MARROW STROMAL CELLS AND 

MINERALIZED ECM PRODUCTION IN VITRO  

Biomaterials and scaffolds considered for bone tissue engineering are often 

evaluated in vitro for their ability to support adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of 

progenitor cells along the osteogenic pathway prior to being evaluated in vivo. In vitro cell-

scaffold interactions are determined using osteoblasts, osteosarcoma cell lines, and 

osteoprogenitor cells. The scaffolds used for this purpose mimic the ECM of bone and play a 

crucial role in supporting cell functions and differentiation, but may also be used to deliver 

biomolecules.  

Osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs comprises cell proliferation, cell maturation, and 

matrix mineralization. During these phases, cells synthesize and secrete alkaline 

phosphatase, type I collagen, and other noncollagenous ECM proteins, such as osteocalcin, 

osteopontin, osteonectin, and bone sialoprotein. Mineralization occurs through accumulation 

of calcium and phosphorous in the ECM. 

 

 

 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

16 

4.1. BMSCs versus MSCs 

The osteoprogenitor cells used for bone tissue engineering purposes are derived from 

a various tissue sources. Bone marrow stroma consists of a heterogeneous population that 

provides structural and physiological support for hematopoietic cells (128). Bone marrow 

contains three main cell types: endothelial cells, hematopoietic cells, and stromal cells. 

Friedenstein et al. (129, 130) was the first to identify in bone marrow cell populations with 

strong osteogenic potential. When marrow cells are plated at low cell densities, bone marrow 

stromal cells (BMSCs) form colonies and are defined as “colony forming unit-fibroblasts” 

(CFU-Fs); this term indicates that each colony derives from a single proliferating progenitor 

(131). The term “BMSCs” is applied to isolated bone marrow cells with potential to form 

connective tissues (131).  

Due to their high proliferation potential, BMSCs can be expanded in culture to obtain 

large numbers of cells starting from a small sample of bone marrow aspirate. The BMSC 

population contains precursor cells capable of extensive proliferation and differentiation into 

several phenotypes. Furthermore, BMSCs maintain their multipotential capacity during 

prolonged culture and multiple passages in vitro. Among these BMSCs there is a 

subpopulation of undifferentiated multipotent cells able to generate ‘‘mesenchyme’’, the mass 

of tissue that develops from the mesoderm of an embryo. This cell population is present in all 

postnatal tissues and is referred to as the “mesenchymal stem cell” (MSC) (132, 133). In the 

past, researchers working with cells from the bone marrow used different names to refer to 

the same cells. This practice leads to nomenclature confusion; for example, BMSCs have 

been reffered to as multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs), MSCs, bone marrow stromal 

stem cells (BMSSCs), and mesodermal progenitor cells (MPCs) (134). What s presently 

known is that, if appropriately induced, these cells can also differentiate along multiple 

pathways to form various cells from a number of tissues, including bone, cartilage, and fat 

(135).  

Stem cells are able to provide replacements for various differentiated cell types. The 

use of MSCs has several advantages, as they have unique biological properties, are capable 

of extensive replication in culture in an undifferentiated state, and can differentiate along 

multiple pathways to form various cells from a number of tissues, including bone, cartilage, 

and fat (4). Identification of stem cells using surface markers has not been definitive either, 

because similar markers are also present on nonstem cells, or because a particular marker 

may only be temporarily expressed on a stem cell at a certain stage or under specific 

conditions. 

 

 

 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

 

17 

4.2. Osteogenic differentiation 

In addition to being osteoconductive and osteoinductive, an ideal scaffold for bone 

tissue engineering application, should also be osteogenic (that is, containing living cells 

capable of differentiation into osteoblasts). Differentiation of MSCs along the osteoblastic 

lineage in vitro starts with a period of cell proliferation followed by synthesis and deposition of 

ECM components by the cells; accumulation of calcium finally leads to mineralization of the 

ECM. To induce osteogenic differentiation in MSCs, the culture medium is usually 

supplemented with osteogenic agents such as dexamethasone, ?-glycerophosphate, and 

ascorbic acid. 

Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, stimulates MSC proliferation and 

supports osteogenic lineage differentiation (136-138). Organic phosphates, such as ?-

glycerophosphate, also support osteogenesis by contributing to mineralization of the ECM 

and modulating osteoblast function (138-140). Free phosphates can also induce expression 

of osteogenic protein markers, such as osteopontin (138, 141). Other supplements, such as 

ascorbic acid, enhance collagen synthesis and upregulate alkaline phosphatase expression 

in bone cells. Ascorbic acid stimulates marrow stromal cells to differentiate along the 

osteoblast lineage (141-143). Furthermore, ascorbic acid promotes osteogenic induction 

evidenced by increased alkaline phosphatase activity and production of osteocalcin in 

osteogenic cultures (144). 

Martins et al. (76) used marrow stromal cells cultured on blends of starch with poly(?-

caprolactone) scaffolds in static cultures and reported that the enzyme lipase enhanced 

osteogenic differentiation and promoted deposition of mineralized ECM. The BMP family of 

growth factors is frequently used for osteoinduction. BMP-2 increases calcium-containing 

nodule formation and the calcium content of osteogenic cultures in vitro (138). The TGF- ? 

superfamily contains a large number of growth factors with different functions, many of which 

regulate cell proliferation and ECM production. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), namely 

FGF-1 and FGF-2 are produced by osteoblasts and are constituents of the bone matrix. 

Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) stimulates osteogenesis; IGF-2 is the most abundant growth 

factor found in bone matrix. Gomes et al. (145) demonstrated that an in vitro generated 

bone-like ECM produced by marrow stromal cells contains bioactive growth factors including 

TGF-?1, FGF-2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and BMP-2. Pham et al. (146) 

reported that the gene expression profiles of various bone-related growth factors and ECM 

proteins in MSCs cultured in osteogenic media were upregulated; these chemical 

compounds are present in native bone tissue. Costa-Pinto et al. (48) studied the osteogenic 

differentiation of a mouse MSC line (BMC9) cultured on novel melt-based chitosan/polyester 

scaffolds and reported high levels of alkaline phosphatase activity and formation of a 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

18 

calcified ECM; these results are evidence of differentiation of the cells along the osteogenic 

pathway. 

Expression of osteoblastic phenotype markers in culture defines three different 

phases of bone-related activities: cell proliferation, ECM maturation, and ECM mineralization. 

During active cell proliferation, growth-related genes are expressed, and minimal levels of 

type I collagen are observed (147). Following this phase, a period of matrix maturation 

occurs when alkaline phosphatase is maximally expressed. Finally, the ECM becomes 

mineralized, the third period of the bone developmental sequence (147). There are two 

transition periods between the aforementioned developmental periods: the first occurs at the 

end of proliferative period and the second when expression of osteoblastic phenotype 

markers (such as osteocalcin and osteopontin), become significantly elevated with the onset 

of mineralization (147). 

Alkaline phosphatase activity, an early marker of the osteoblastic phenotype, is 

upregulated at the onset of cell differentiation but subsequently decreases as cell 

differentiation progresses. Another marker of bone formation is calcium-containing mineral 

deposits in the ECM. To detect mineral deposition, tetracycline-HCl is added to the 

osteogenic culture media (148). Tetracycline acts as a fluorochrome-labeling agent for bone 

tissues (149). Tetracycline accumulates sites of bone formation and fluoresces brightly when 

activated with appropriate fluorescent light. Qualitative (or semiquantitative) analysis of 

calcium-containing mineral deposits in bone cell cultures uses von Kossa, alizarin red, and 

methylene blue/basic fuchsin staining methods (148, 150).  An important artifact, which 

should be kept in mind when using these analyses, is that the ECM uptakes calcium 

independently from cell-mediated mineral deposition. For this reason, confirmation of the 

results obtained using the aforementioned staining methods should be complemented with 

data either diffraction or spectroscopy methods such as thin-film X-ray diffraction (TF-XRD) 

and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (76, 150, 151). 

  Expression of osteopontin occurs during the mid- to late-stages of osteogenic 

differentiation of MSCs (152). Osteopontin is an extracellular protein secreted by 

differentiating osteoblasts that is upregulated both during cell proliferation and at the onset of 

ECM mineralization. Osteocalcin, another late-stage marker of osteoblastic differentiation, 

can be assessed using commercially available immunoassays. Immunohistochemistry using 

specific antibodies to detect the presence of growth factors, bone- and ECM-related proteins, 

and enzymes is well established and widely used. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain 

reaction (RT-PCR) is used to determine expression of bone-related genes, such as 

osteoblast marker genes, growth factors, and ECM biomolecules, in MSCs (146). 

 

 



CHAPTER I. Introduction

4.3. Bone-specific matrix proteins 

The bone matrix is not only composed of a mineralized phase, but also of an organic 

phase containing collagenous and other noncollagenous proteins, matrix metalloproteinases, 

proteoglycans, and glycoproteins. Bone formation involves regulated secretion, deposition, 

and removal of a complex array of these matrix proteins, which appear in a defined temporal 

and spatial sequence (12). Mineralization also dictates the spatial orientation of matrix 

deposition (12). Most proteins originally thought to be unique to the bone ECM were 

subsequently proven to be expressed in many other tissues of the body. Osteocalcin is the 

only protein still considered to be bone specific in bone mineralization (12). 

As discussed previously, alkaline phosphatase is considered an early-stage marker of 

osteoblastic differentiation (147) and is expressed during the postcell proliferative period of 

ECM deposition. Type I collagen, the major ECM protein of bone, provides a template for 

subsequent mineralization (153). Alkaline phosphatase, collagen, and osteonectin are 

expressed at high levels near the end of cell proliferation and during the period of ECM 

deposition and maturation (141). 

Osteopontin and bone sialoprotein, N-linked glycoproteins containing integrin-binding 

RGD motifs, are involved in cell-matrix interactions. Osteopontin is widely distributed in 

different tissues, whereas bone sialoprotein is highly enriched in bone and skeletal cartilage 

(154). Osteopontin, a phosphorylated glycoprotein associated with the early stages of 

osteogenesis that precede mineralization, is secreted by osteoblats into the mineralizing 

ECM during bone development (141, 155). In bone, bone sialoprotein is expressed by fully 

mature osteogenic cells capable of depositing mineralized matrix (154). Extracellular bone 

sialoprotein localizes to newly formed, mineralized bone matrix; its distribution coincides with 

that of mineral deposits (156). Bone sialoprotein, a protein expressed during early phases of 

bone deposition, controls both mineral formation and cell-matrix interactions (157). This 

protein is used as a marker of initial bone formation (157). The function of bone sialoprotein 

in bone, which is not been completely elucidated yet, may be related to the regulation of 

physiological mineralization of skeletal ECMs (156, 158). Osteocalcin is another marker of 

late-term osteogenic differentiation associated with osteoblast-mediated matrix deposition 

and mineralization (159, 160). Expression of osteopontin, osteocalcin, and bone sialoprotein 

occurs later during the third period of ECM mineralization. 

 

5. SUMMARY 

Surface modification of biomaterials uses methods that mimic biomineralization and 

enable the incorporation of bioactive molecules and agents; such treatments can improve 

both in vitro and in vivo osteogenic differentiation. The main objective of CaP coatings is 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

20 

osteoconduction and enhanced adhesion of osteogenic cells onto biomaterial surfaces. 

Because CaP coatings have structures and chemical properties similar to those of native 

bone, they have great potential and promise to increase bone ingrowth in areas of clinical 

need. 

Because they lack essential properties, such as bioactivity and osteoinductivity, most 

currently available polymers present limitations for bone-related biomedical application. In 

this respect then, the biomimetic coating technique discussed in the present chapter has the 

potential to impart these essential properties to biomaterials. Since CaP layers can be on 3D 

scaffolds the biomimetic coating approach has been receiving increased attention in the 

bone tissue engineering field.  

Moreover, CaP coatings have been considered as a potential carrier for the delivery 

of various biomolecules, chosen for their physicochemical and biological properties, as well 

as for their osteoconductivity. Complementing the CaP biomimetic coating approach, 

incorporation of biomolecules provides osteoinductive properties to biomaterials. Since this 

method is carried out under physiological conditions, proteins, enzymes, and other bioactive 

agents can be incorporated into CaP layers without loss of their activity. A major advantage 

is the fact that the biomaterial-CaP coating-biomolecule can simultaneously exhibit 

osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties, because it can act as a carrier system for the 

controlled release of multiple biologically active proteins. Incorporation of enzymes into CaP 

layers coated on the surface of scaffolds (using the biomimetic coating technique) can be 

also used to control the degradation rate of the material substrate in vivo. An integrated 

approach combining a scaffold, CaP coatings, bioactive molecules and/or enzymes, and in 

vitro cultures may provide an optimal environment for cell adhesion and osteogenic 

differentiation as well as generate a mineralized ECM containing select bioactive molecules. 

Incorporation of bioactive molecules into CaP coatings on scaffolds for bone tissue 

engineering applications has the potential to provide advanced tissue-specific constructs to 

promote improved alternative treatment of bone pathologies and trauma. The present 

chapter summarized the results of studies that used biomolecules important to elucidate 

important aspects such as details of the release profiles of entrapped bioactive molecules 

and retention of their bioactivity. Establishment and further development of nature-inspired 

techniques to design and formulate novel biomaterials could provide the next generation of 

effective scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.

PART II.  Naturally Derived Responsive and In Situ-Forming Scaffolds for Bone 

Tissue Engineering Applications: An Overview of the Last Decade2 

 

ABSTRACT 

The use of bioabsorbable polymeric scaffolds is being investigated for use in bone 

tissue engineering applications, as their properties can be tailored to allow them to degrade 

and integrate at optimal rates as bone remodelling is completed. The main goal of this review 

is to highlight the “biomimetic” and “intelligent” properties exhibited by some specific natural 

scaffolds and their use in the bone tissue engineering field. To complement the fast evolution 

of the bone tissue engineering field, it is important to propose the use of responsive scaffolds 

and take advantage of bioinspired materials and their properties as emerging technologies. 

There is a growing interest and need for new biomaterials, such as “smart”/responsive 

materials with the capability to respond to changes in the in vivo environment have been 

devoted. This review will provide an overview of strategies that can modulate bone tissue 

regeneration by using in situ-forming scaffolds.

CHAPTER I. Introduction  

36 

1. INTRODUCTION 

Bone is a highly vascular, living and dynamic tissue remarkable for its combination of 

mechanical properties and regenerative capacity. Bone possesses self-regeneration 

capacity. However, there is a limit to the size of bone fractures and defects that can be self-

repaired. This limit is designated as the “critical size defect”1-3 and will not heal during the 

lifetime of the patient. For large defects medical intervention is often necessary to repair the 

bone. A new field of research that proposes the regeneration of the tissue instead of its 

substitution is defined as tissue engineering: “an interdisciplinary field of research that 

applies the principles of engineering and the life sciences towards the development of 

biological substitutes that restore, maintain or improve tissue function”4.  Tissue engineering 

strategies involving scaffolds include two general categories: (1) the use of acellular matrices 

(artificial scaffolds or decellularized tissues), which depend upon the natural ability of the 

body to regenerate for proper orientation and direction of new tissue growth, and (2) the use 

of scaffolds with cells4, 5. But the most classical paradigm of Tissue Engineering for tissue 

regeneration implies the use of a degradable support or scaffold material, bioactive factors 

and cells4, 6, 7. Several characteristics and properties have been described 8, 9 as sine qua 

non requirements for a suitable scaffold to be used in bone tissue engineering: 

biocompatibility, biodegradability into nontoxic products, and the ability to resorb at the 

adequate rate follow the repair of bone; adequate surface characteristics for cell adhesion 

and proliferation; an interconnected porous structure that enable tissue ingrowth, 

vascularisation, exchange of nutrients, oxygen and metabolites; and suitable mechanical 

properties matching those of the native tissue. The biomaterial must maintain its structural 

integrity during the first stages of the new bone formation. The main aim behind the different 

approaches of bone tissue engineering consists of developing a functionalized responsive 

and bioresorbable scaffold able to stimulate cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation, 

with the objective that osteoblasts produce bone extracellular matrix (ECM). 

Learning from Nature is a concept that implies mimicking Nature to develop novel 

functional biomaterials such as biomineralized, “smart” or bonelike composite materials10-15. 

“Smart” scaffolds and bioreactors are being developed to enable advanced procedures for 

delivery of bioactive molecules and mechanical stimuli to cultured cells in order to direct 

osteogenic differentiation13, 14, 16-19. It has been stimulated increased attention for responsive 

strategies in vitro, such as the use of flow perfusion bioreactors. The strategy includes the 

culture of bone marrow stromal cells onto scaffolds under flow conditions which allow a 

better distribution of nutrients and oxygen and the necessary mechanical stimuli for cellular 

differentiation along the osteogenic lineage20-22. This approach is an ideal system for the ex 

vivo production of bone constructs23-25. Notwithstanding the deeply discussed typical bone

37 

tissue engineering strategy, which involves the use of a porous scaffold, cells and bioactive 

molecules, this review will focus on alternative approaches, such as the use of 

“smart”/responsive acellular scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications. 

The role of naturally derived materials and environmental stimuli in modulating bone 

regeneration will be discussed. While many excellent biomaterials have been developed in 

recent years, their translation into clinical practice has been slow. Chitosan was the selected 

natural polymer to be explored in this review mainly because of its pH responsive properties 

and biodegradability. The present review intends to provide an overview of the current state 

of the art of naturally derived responsive scaffolds and in situ-forming concepts for bone 

tissue engineering applications, their aims and limitations. 

 

2. SCAFFOLDS FOR BONE TISSUE ENGINEERING 

The simplest way to define a scaffold for tissue engineering is that it should provide 

mechanical support, shape, and cell-scale architecture for neo-tissue construction in vitro or 

in vivo as seeded cells expand and organize26. Scaffolds mimic the extracellular matrix and 

have a crucial role to play in supporting cell growth, differentiation and in delivering growth 

factors or other bioactive molecules. Extracellular matrix (ECM) is involved in bone formation, 

remodelling, and repair and its components include minerals, ions, proteins, and enzymes. 

The traditional scaffolds for bone tissue engineering should present standard parameters 

such as high porosity, large surface area, mechanical properties and pore sizes appropriate 

for the intended application, and a highly interconnected pore structure4, 7, 27. It has been 

reported that high porosity and pore sizes of 100-400 ?m in the scaffold are necessary for 

bone ingrowth7, 28. In addition, biocompatibility and biodegradability are also required 

properties of scaffolds13, 14. In this review we will highlight some characteristics of acellular 

scaffolds, such as mechanical properties and biodegradability.  

The degradation rate of the scaffolds must be tuned appropriately with the growth rate 

of the new tissue, by the time the injury site is totally regenerated the scaffold should be 

totally degraded2, 13, 14. If the degradation is faster than the tissue regeneration, the scaffolds 

will loose its support function for tissue growth. On the other hand, if the degradation is too 

slow compared to tissue formation, the scaffold will compromise the regeneration of the 

tissue. Mechanical properties of bulk materials represent an important group of 

characteristics to considerer in three-dimensional (3D) artificial ECM (scaffold) design29. Bulk 

materials are fundamental contributors to the mechanical integrity of the scaffold. This 

property is especially important for tissue engineering of structural tissues. Thus, the 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

38 

scaffolds should have mechanical properties resembling those of healthy tissue during the 

period of tissue regeneration7, 27. Mechanical strength is needed for the creation of a 3D 

structure that will retain its structure after implantation, particularly in the reconstruction of 

hard and load-bearing bone tissues28.  

 

2.1. Mechanical properties 

The mechanical properties of the implanted scaffold should ideally match those of 

living bone7, 27, 30. This demanding balance represents one limitation of scaffolds intended for 

bone regeneration and generally leads to mechanical biomaterial failure. Low mechanical 

strength of porous scaffolds may not be suitable for the repair of load-bearing tissues in 

some clinical applications31. Depending upon the application, mechanical properties should 

be studied keeping in mind the surrounding environment of the scaffold once placed in an in 

vivo system. The initial mechanical properties of the scaffold to be implanted are extremely 

important and ideally should be similar to those of the bone that is intended to be 

regenerated. Besides providing appropriate support in the early stages of healing, the long-

term success of the biomaterial will depend on the efficacious graded load transfer needed in 

the later stages of the remodelling process32. The mechanical properties of the two types of 

bone, i.e., the cortical (compact) and cancellous (spongy) bone, are listed in Table 1. Highly 

porous structures with interconnected pores may fail their objective due to poor mechanical 

properties.

2.2. Mechanisms of polymer biodegradation 

Controlling the degradation of scaffolds to match the rate of bone growth, to create 

space for the new bone formation until full regeneration is reached, remains a major 

challenge in scaffold design. The ideal degradable material degrades during its intended 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

 

39 

application or immediately after it. The process of polymer degradation describes the 

mechanisms through which polymer chains are cleaved to form oligomers and finally 

monomers34. The process of erosion designates the loss of material owing to monomers and 

oligomers leaving the polymer34, 35.  All biodegradable polymers have hydrolysable bonds. 

Their most important degradation mechanism is enzymatic hydrolysis. The latter effect is 

designated as biodegradation meaning that the degradation is mediated by a biological 

process34. Several factors influence the kinetics of degradation: the type of chemical bonds, 

pH, polymer composition, crystallinity, molecular weight, porosity, water uptake and location 

of the implant34. Hydrophilic polymers absorb large quantities of water and increase 

degradation rates. Resorbable biomaterials have the ability to resorb over time. This 

behaviour is necessary to support the gradual ingrowth of cells and complete replacement of 

a regenerated matrix by normal tissue, and to avoid risk of complications that can be 

associated with the long-term presence of foreign material36. Scaffold evaluation also 

includes studying the appropriate degradation rate, which is important because as the 

scaffold degrades it is replaced by natural tissue. Biodegradation is generally required for a 

tissue engineering scaffold material, and the degradation rate also needs to match the neo 

tissue formation rate to ideally serve the template purpose27, 28, 37. Bone tissue engineering 

generally requires an artificial extracellular matrix (scaffold) to regenerate tissue at the site of 

implantation. This scaffold should disappear through absorption into the body as the new 

tissue is regenerated37.   

 

3. “SMART” AND RESPONSIVE SCAFFOLDS FOR BONE TISSUE ENGINEERING  

Stimuli-responsive, “smart”, “intelligent” or environmentally-sensitive polymers 

respond with large property changes to small chemical, physical or biochemical stimuli 

(Table 2). The concept of “smart” polymers derived from the development of biomaterials that 

show large conformational changes in response to small environmental stimuli such as 

temperature, ionic strength, pH, or light26, 38. The materials that respond to changes in their 

surrounding environment are very attractive because these changes, mainly in vivo, can be 

exploited to control parameters such as drug delivery, cell adhesion, mechanical properties, 

and permeability, among others39. The responses of the polymer may include precipitation or 

gelation, reversible adsorption on a surface, collapse of a hydrogel or surface graft, and 

alternation between hydrophilic and hydrophobic states26, 40. Natural polymers may present a 

more appropriate biological environment to the cells, since they usually contain domains that 

can send important signals to guide the cells at various stages of development41. Collagen 

and fibrin, natural ECM molecules, have been used as scaffolds for tissue engineering. They 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

40 

have interesting biological properties for tissue engineering research42-45. However, their low 

mechanical properties, the risk of viral infection, antigenicity, instability and deterioration that 

follow long-term implantation limit the clinical applications of these natural biomaterials37.

4. CHITOSAN SCAFFOLDS AS A RESPONSIVE BIOMATERIAL  

Polysaccharides are very attractive for tissue engineering applications mainly 

because of their biodegradability, biocompatibility and resemblance with the environment of 

the extracellular matrix47, 48. Examples of anionic naturally derived polymers are alginate, 

hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulphate and carragenans48. However chitosan is the only 

cationic polysaccharide found in Nature. In the last decade, significant attention has been 

given to chitosan-based biomaterials13, 49-55 in the field of bone tissue engineering. This 

review will focus on chitosan, a polycationic natural-origin polymer produced by the 

deacetylation of chitin, a natural component of crustacea exoskeletons (e.g. shrimp, crab, 

lobster, etc.), cell walls of fungi and cuticles of insects54, 56. Chitosan is a binary 

polyheterosaccharide of N-acetylglucosamine and glucosamine with a ?1?4 linkage. The 

superior tissue compatibility of chitosan can be partially attributed to its structural similarity to 

glycosaminoglycans, which are major components of the ECM of bone and cartilage54, 57. 

Chitosan exhibits a pH-sensitive behavior due to the large quantities of amino groups on its 

chains. It is a biocompatible, pH-dependent cationic polymer, which is insoluble in aqueous 

solutions above pH 755. However, in dilute or weak acids (pH&lt;6), the protonated free amino 

groups of glucosamine facilitate solubility of the molecule55. Above pH 6.2 chitosan aqueous 

solutions lead to the formation of a hydrated gel-like precipitate58, 59. Temperature and pH 

have been extensively studied in the biomedical field because these two parameters can be 

easily controlled and applicable both in vitro and in vivo. Dias et al.60 reported the use of 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

 

41 

chitosan, a natural and pH-responsive polymer, grafted onto a biodegradable bioactive 

composite and investigated the effect of pH on the biomineralization process. The authors 

successfully developed “smart” biodegradable surfaces that respond to pH and that could be 

used to control the biomineralization process. They also found that the formation of 

biomimetic apatite was dependent on the conformational changes of chitosan across its 

critical pH and could be controlled by pH switching.  

Chitosan hydrogels have been used in a number of gene and drug delivery 

applications and can deliver growth factors and pharmaceutical agents in a controlled 

fashion61-63. Due to its cationic nature and predictable degradation rate, chitosan-based 

materials bind growth factors and release them in a controlled manner64.  

Chitosan is degraded, depending on degree of deacetylation by enzymes such as 

lysozyme, N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase and lipases61. In vivo, chitosan is degraded by 

enzymatic hydrolysis, primarily by lysozyme which appears to target acetylated residues65, 66. 

Degradation kinetics seem to be inversely related to the degree of deacetylation65. The 

degree of deacetylation represents the proportion of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units with 

respect to the total number of units67. Lysozyme breaks down the chitosan polymer chain, 

diminishing its molecular weight until it becomes short enough to be processed by cells. 

Glucosamines, the final degradation products of chitosan, are nontoxic, nonimmunogenic, 

and noncarcinogenic68. In vivo, the final degradation products undergo normal metabolism 

pathways and may be incorporated into glycoproteins or excreted as carbon dioxide gas 

during respiration69, 70. Lysozyme or muramidase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis 

of the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls71. This enzyme is active over a broad pH 

range from 3 to 8 and is suited to hydrolyze its substrates both inside and outside cells. 

Lysozyme is ubiquitous in the human body72. It is present in lymphocytes and also secreted 

by monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes, which account for the largest source73, 74. 

Monocytes and macrophages are the dominating contributors to the lysozyme content in 

serum73. Human serum lysozyme is found in concentrations from 7 to 13 mg/L72. 

Chitosan possesses interesting characteristics, such as its ability to induce a minimal 

foreign body reaction, an intrinsic antibacterial nature75, 76, and the ability to be molded in 

various shapes, namely porous structures, suitable for cell ingrowth and osteoconduction. 

The mechanical properties of chitosan scaffolds are dependent on the pore size and pore 

orientation75.

5. NATURALLY DERIVED IN SITU FORMING SCAFFOLDS  

The goal of the in situ generated implant strategy is used to engineer biomedical 

systems at their site of performance using minimally invasive surgeries77. Several 

approaches have been developed78-80 namely synthetic in situ scaffolding materials that 

could deliver cells or provide a structure for tissue infiltration. Naturally occurring polymers 

that form thermoreversible gels include gelatine, carrageenan, cellulose derivatives, 

xyloglucan and chitosan with glycerophosphate58. Moreover, several natural biomaterials, 

including collagen, heparin, hyaluronate, and fibrin have been used for the preparation of 

injectable in situ-forming scaffolds81-86. Besides eliminating the need for ex vivo implant 

fabrication, the contact and adhesion between the biomaterial and native bone may be 

enhanced with a polymer formed directly in the bone defect (in situ)87. Current approaches 

for implanting medical devices often require complex surgeries. In the past few years, an 

increasing number of in situ-forming systems have been proposed for various biomedical 

applications, including drug delivery88-90, cell encapsulation58, 91, and tissue repair83, 92, 93. 

There are several possible mechanisms leading to in situ implant formation. It has become 

increasingly apparent that scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications should provide 

more than temporary 3D structure for developing tissue construct. Due to the pH-sensitive 

character of chitosan, this polymer has great potential to be used in the fabrication of scaffold 

and gels that respond to localized conditions of pH in the human body. Hai Bang Lee et al.94 

stated that it is difficult to perform ex vivo fabrication of certain complex scaffold geometries. 

As an alternative, they reported the use of in situ–forming scaffolds as a promising approach 

for the fabrication of complicated scaffold geometries. The in situ–forming scaffold is based 

on the idea that if a biomaterial undergoes a simple liquid-to-gel phase transition under 

physiological conditions, it can be injected as a liquid, and then form the desired gel in situ94-

96. As previously reported, Ruel-Gariepy et al.58, 97 demonstrated that a mixture of chitosan 

and glycerol phosphate disodium salt (?-glycerophosphate) is capable of forming a gel 

scaffold in situ. These formulations possess a neutral pH, remain liquid at or below room 

temperature, and form monolithic gels at body temperature58. The stability of the solution at 

room temperature and the gelation time increases as the degree of deacetylation 

decreases58, 97. Hai Bang Lee et al.94 described the development of in situ–forming chitosan 

gels, and their ability to offer a suitable scaffold for rat bone marrow stromal cells (rBMSCs) 

in vitro and in vivo. The in situ-forming scaffold provides numerous benefits, such as its being 

a noninvasive alternative for tissue engineering applications. These results showed that 

chitosan gel can serve as an in situ–forming gel scaffold for entrapped rBMSCs in vivo. 

Studies dealing with the role of stem/progenitor cells in osteogenesis show that chitosan has 

the ability to promote osteogenic progenitor cell recruitment and attachment, facilitating bone 

formation98.

As cell and molecular biology converge with materials science and biomedical 

engineering, new applications will benefit from interactive biomaterials that serve to 

orchestrate cell attachment, growth and differentiation26. Recently, a considerable interest 

has been given to the development of “smart” materials with the ability to instruct the 

behaviour of cells by releasing bioactive molecules into the local environment99, 100.  

 

6. IN SITU PORE-FORMING SCAFFOLDS 

One of the major challenges of bone tissue engineering is the development of 

scaffolds capable of promoting the differentiation of immature progenitor cells down an 

osteoblastic lineage (osteoinduction) encouraging the ingrowth of surrounding bone 

(osteoconduction) and integration into the surrounding tissue101, 102. The main goal of the in 

situ forming scaffolds strategy is to generate systems at their site of implantation using 

minimally invasive surgical procedures or eliminate some steps of the common strategies 

used in bone tissue engineering applications (i.e., cell seeding onto scaffolds ex vivo).  

Acellular scaffolds with properties capable to induce bone regeneration could be an 

interesting alternative. 

One innovative approach was described by the group of by the group of Robert 

Langer103 for the first time in 2003 proposing in situ pore formation in a polymer matrix by 

differential degradation. The common approaches have been developed to introduce porosity 

in a polymer matrix ex vivo and thus facilitate cell seeding either in vitro or in vivo. In that 

paper, the authors stated that controlling pore formation in vivo with specific tissue ingrowth 

could be beneficial for bone tissue engineering and presented a new paradigm for the 

formation of pores in a polymer matrix in situ 103. For that, polymer microspheres were used 

as a pore-forming agent (porogen)103. 

It has been demonstrated that hydrophilic polymers such as chitosan, depending on 

the processing method and shape present suitable mechanical properties for bone tissue 

engineering applications13.  

The inclusion of enzymatically degradable phases in biomaterials seems to be a very 

promising approach to obtain scaffolds with adequate mechanical properties in the initial 

stage of implantation and with a gradual in vivo pore-forming ability. Martins et al.13 described 

the development of a biodegradable matrix, based on chitosan and starch with the ability of 

forming a porous structure in situ due to the attack by specific enzymes present in the human 

body, taking advantage of the inflammatory response. One of the critical factors that can 

control bone tissue regeneration is the degradation rate of the scaffold, as previously 



CHAPTER I. Introduction  

44 

discussed. Tailoring the degradation rate of scaffolds can facilitate scaffold remodelling and 

replacement by cells in situ, enhancing bone tissue regeneration. Inflammation is often 

viewed as a negative event, but it is fundamental for tissue regeneration processes104. 

Consequently, modulating the response of implanted material by harnessing characteristics 

of the inflammatory response is a powerful tool for driving tissue regeneration in situ. In this 

section alternative strategies will be discussed, such as the potential of using responsive 

scaffolds to take advantage of the host inflammatory response and thus obtain a beneficial 

outcome for bone tissue engineering applications. When a material is implanted, an acute 

inflammation is initiated involving several cell types105-107. During inflammation neutrophils, 

monocytes and macrophages are present. These cells release lysosomal enzymes, such as 

lysozyme, into the surrounding tissue108. It has been suggested that macrophages and 

neutrophils produce superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl free radicals which 

contribute to the biodegradation of implanted materials108. The results of the compressive 

tests showed that these materials, based on chitosan and starch exhibited very interesting 

mechanical properties in the dry and even in the wet state13. The mechanical properties 

exhibited by the scaffolds in the wet state fall in the normal ranges of strength and modulus 

for trabecular bone7, 28. This approach seem to be a promising strategy to produce an in vivo 

responsive scaffold, the properties of which may be regulated by the bone regeneration 

process, with gradual formation of pores in situ and consequent resorption. Using this 

innovative methodology, the developed scaffolds can exhibit suitable mechanical properties 

at the initial stage of implantation due to the inexistence of macroporosity. The porosity will 

be formed in situ by enzymes present in the human body. In this work, authors aimed at 

developing a biodegradable matrix based on chitosan and native starch that forms a porous 

structure in vivo due to the incorporation of the “sacrifice” phase (native starch) that will be 

preferentially attacked by specific enzymes and other reactive species present in the human 

body during the inflammatory response (Figure 1).

CHAPTER I. Introduction  

 

45 

An alternative approach, involving the concept of bioactivity and osteoconduction, is 

to let degradation proceed along a coordinate of the healing process by making the material 

sensitive to the feedback provided by the cells involved in the healing response109. A 

biomimetic scaffold for bone tissue engineering can be any scaffolding material that mimics 

one or multiple characteristics of the natural ECM110. Functional materials such as calcium 

phosphate (CaP)111 and hydroxyapatite112 are often mixed with bulk materials to mimic bone 

ECM composition. CaP has a composition similar to bone mineral and can induce a 

biological response identical to that generated in bone remodelling113. The process of 

resorption of old bone mineral and formation of new bone is designated as bone 

remodelling113. The biomimetic technique for coating biomaterials with a bone-like apatite 

layer is well described18, 114-116 and has been applied for the first time to biodegradable 

substrates and then to scaffolds by Reis et al.18, 51, 61, 115, 117, 118. Biomimetic CaP coating 

involves immersion of polymers in simulated body fluid (SBF), a solution with ion 

concentration identical to human plasma. CaP coatings have shown high efficiency in 

expediting bone osteoconduction119. However, for the regeneration of bone, osteoconduction 

is also important100. The incorporation of proteins and enzymes18, 120-127 into CaP coatings is 

well documented.  Further studies proposed an innovative self-regulated degrading material 

with gradual in situ pore formation ability for bone tissue engineering applications. In this 

study127 one of the main aims was to improve the osteoconductive properties of chitosan 

scaffolds. For that, lysozyme was incorporated into CaP coatings, prepared on the surface of 

chitosan scaffolds using a biomimetic coating technique, with the aim of controlling their 

degradation rate and subsequent formation of pores. Furthermore, since lysozyme has 

antibacterial properties, these coatings may act as carriers for its sustained release, 

preventing infection upon implantation. Moreover, CaP coatings will enhance the 

osteoconductive properties of the chitosan scaffolds. Mineral deposition has been shown to 

slow scaffold degradation, probably by creating a barrier between the scaffold surface and 

surrounding environment128. In order to avoid this, one possible solution was the 

incorporation of the enzyme lysozyme to enhance degradation of chitosan scaffolds and 

subsequent formation of pores in situ (Figure 2).

Responsive scaffolds for bone tissue engineering do not need to show the stimulus-

dependent change in a reversible fashion. For example, after the cells or bioactive molecules 

are delivered, the scaffolds do not need to reverse the process. As it was discussed above, 

biodegradability and lack of cytotoxicity are required characteristics of bone tissue 

engineering scaffolds.  

“Smart”/responsive polymers may offer promise for revolutionary improvements in 

tissue engineering scaffolds. Beyond the physical properties of polymers, a major goal is to 

improve the mechanical properties at the initial stage of implantation and if possible to avoid 

one of the most critical steps of the tissue engineering approach, that is the pre-seeding of 

the scaffolds with cells. Creating scaffolds with specific properties that per se could recruit 

cells to the site of implantation is in our opinion one of the main current challenges in the 

field.  

 

7. CONCLUSIONS 

Therapies for the treatment of lost tissue include tissue transplantation, surgical 

reconstruction, drug therapy, synthetic prostheses and medical devices or associations of 

those. The efforts to address their limitations have elicited the development of different

biomaterials and therapies. In this review we aimed at presenting as alternative approaches 

the engineering of responsive and in situ-forming scaffolds for bone regeneration. 

Chitosan is one of the most promising natural polymers for bone tissue engineering 

due, in part, to its particular ability to form various shapes and structures. The predictable 

degradation rate and the ability of forming a porous structures and scaffolds in situ makes 

chitosan interesting alternative biomaterial for orthopaedic applications.  

In the first part of this review, biodegradation and mechanical properties were 

highlighted as necessary requirements for the implantation of acellular scaffolds. In the 

second part, we presented developments and examples of naturally derived responsive 

scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. Finally, we described a new strategy for bone tissue 

engineering: the in situ pore-forming concept. Despite the recent advances, future research 

focusing on the development of novel scaffolds that per se could recruit the desirable cells, 

regenerate the site of implantation and reabsorb as a function of degradation time still 

comprises one of the most demanding and challenging strategies in the field of bone tissue 

engineering.

CHAPTER II 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 

1. PRODUCTION OF THE MATERIALS 

1.1. SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds 

Porous scaffolds used in the Chapters III and IV were based on a blend of corn starch 

and poly(?-caprolactone) (SPCL, 30/70%) prepared using a fiber bonding technique [1]. 

SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds were cylinders with 8-mm diameter and thickness of 1.6 ± 0.1mm 

[2]. Previous studies have demonstrated that these scaffolds were able to induce ostegenic 

differentiation of rat marrow stromal cells when flow perfusion bioreactors were used, as well 

as, to express in vitro, several bone growth factors that are usually associated with bone 

formation in vivo [1, 3, 4].  

 

1.2. Chitosan-based scaffolds 

Finely ground chitosan (DD of 95%) powder was dissolved in acetic acid 1% (v/v) to 

obtain a 5% (w/v) clear solution (CH) without any particulate material. Because of the 

relatively high concentration, these solutions are quite viscous and consequently can be 

stirred only slightly. However, flow is still observed and it is still possible to inject such 

viscous solutions to fill out the moulds. Then, using the same procedure, other formulations 

were prepared using native corn starch with the following ratios: 80/20 chitosan/starch 

scaffolds (CS80-20) and 60/40 chitosan/starch scaffolds (CS60-40). The solutions were 

casted into moulds and frozen (-18 ºC) overnight. 

To produce chitosan and chitosan/starch scaffolds, the solutions were immersed in a 

precipitation solution with containing 25% NaOH 1M and 75% of Na2SO4 0.5M (Panreac, 

Barcelona, Spain) adapted from Tuzlakoglu et al. [5]. After precipitation, the samples were 

washed repeatedly with distilled water to remove excess of salts, dried at 37 ºC and followed 

by successive washings for 5 days until no pH changes were detected. These scaffolds were 

used in the studies presented in Chapters V, VI, VII and VIII. 

 

 

 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

60 

1.3. Chitosan-based scaffolds coated with CaP coating and incorporated lysozyme 

The method to prepare the biomimetic CaP coatings was based on the methodology 

previously developed by Abe and Kokubo et al. [6] and adapted by Reis et al. [7, 8] 

consisting in an impregnation of the materials with bioactive glass (Bioglass?45S5, NovaMin 

Technology Inc or NOVABONE, Alachua, Florida, USA) followed by immersion in a 

simulated body fluid (SBF, 37 ºC, pH 7.4), presenting ionic concentrations similar to human 

blood plasma. Prior to the coating process, chitosan scaffolds (CH) and chitosan/starch 

scaffolds (CS) were sterilized by ethylene oxide. Bioglass? 45S5 was sterilized by immersion 

in ethanol solution (70% v/v) and then dried inside the hood. All the subsequent work was 

performed under sterile conditions in a hood. Briefly, CH and CS scaffolds were rolled in a 

wet bed of Bioglass? for the studies described in Chapter VI or in a rotator for 6 hours 

(Chapters VII and VIII). After that, the scaffolds where immersed in simulated body fluid (1.0 

SBF) solution with and without lysozyme from chichen egg white (1 g/L) for 7 days at 37ºC 

(nucleation stage). This stage allows for the formation of CaP nuclei while lysozyme is 

incorporated. After the nucleation stage, all samples were washed with distilled water and 

immersed in a concentrated simulated body fluid solution (1.5 SBF) for 7 days at 37ºC in 

order to enhance CaP nuclei growth (growth stage). Four different samples were obtained 

using the biomimetic coating technique: CaP chitosan scaffolds (CaPCH), CaP 

chitosan/starch scaffolds (CaPCS), CaP chitosan scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme 

(CaPCH + lysozyme) and CaP chitosan/starch scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme (CaPCS 

+ lysozyme). All the solutions were sterilized by filtration prior use.  

 

1.4. Reagents 

All chemical reagents used in the experimental results were purchased from Sigma 

(St. Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise specified. 

 

2. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE DEVELOPED SCAFFOLDS 

 

2.1. Mechanical properties – compression tests 

The mechanical properties of the materials described in Chapter V were evaluated on 

compression tests carried out in the dry and wet state in an Instron 4505 universal 

mechanical testing machine at a controlled environment (23 ºC and 55% RH). The crosshead 

speed was 2 mm min-1 1% strain. 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods

2.2. Degradation studies 

Several degradation studies were carried out with and without enzymes in Chapters 

III, V, VI, and VII. 

 

2.2.1. Degradation studies with ?-amylase or lipase in static and dynamic conditions 

Degradation studies were carried out by incubating samples in phosphate buffered 

saline (PBS) solution (0.1 M, pH 7.4) containing ?-amylase (150 U/L) [9, 10] from Bacillus sp. 

or lipase (110 U/L) [10] from Aspergillus niger, both concentrations similar to those found in 

human serum, and sodium azide (0.2%), to avoid contamination, at 37 ºC up to 30 days 

under static and dynamic conditions (shaker at 70 rpm).The studies were performed in 

triplicate. The enzymatic degradation solutions were changed every 7 days to restore the 

original level of enzymatic activity. At the and of the degradation period, the samples were 

removed, washed thoroughly with distilled water, and dried in graded series of ethanol for 

later calculation of weight loss. These results are described in Chapter III. 

 

 

2.2.2. Degradation studies with ?-amylase and lysozyme 

Degradation studies were carried out by incubating the scaffolds in phosphate 

buffered saline (PBS) solution (pH 7.4) containing ?-amylase (150 U/L [9]) and/or lysozyme 

(13 mg/L [11, 12]) at concentrations similar to the ones found in human serum, at 37 ºC up to 

90 days. A control was also performed by incubating the samples in buffer alone. 

Degradation solutions were also analyzed to measure the concentration of reducing sugars, 

released into the solution as a result of starch hydrolysis by ?-amylase, using the 

dinitrosalicylic acid method. These studies are described in Chapter V. 

 

2.2.3. Degradation studies at pH 7.4 and pH 5 

In order to simulate in vivo conditions, degradation studies were carried out by 

incubating uncoated chitosan scaffolds, CaP coated chitosan scaffolds, with and without 

incorporated lysozyme, in two different buffer solutions: (i) Tris-HCl buffer (0.22 mM, pH 7.4) 

to simulate the normal pH found in human body and (ii) citrate buffer (1.0 mM, pH 5.0) to 

simulate the inflammatory response at 37 ºC for different periods of time. These studies are 

described in Chapter VI. 

 

 

 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

62 

2.2.4. Degradation studies with lysozyme 

Degradation studies presented in Chapter VII were performed by incubating the 

chitosan scaffolds (CH) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution (pH 7.4) with lysozyme 

(1.5 g/L), a concentration similar to the ones incorporated into CaP biomimetic coatings, at 

37 ºC up to 21 days. Lysozyme solution was changed every 7 days.  

 

2.2.5. Water uptake and weight loss measurements 

At the end of each degradation period, the samples were removed and immediately 

weighed for determination of water uptake (Equation 1) (Chapter V), washed thoroughly with 

distilled water and dried for later calculation of weight loss (Equation 2) (Chapters III, V, VI, 

and VII): 

 

Water uptake (%) = [(ww – wi)/ wi] x 100  (Equation 1) 

 

Weight loss (%) = [wi – wf)/ wi] x 100  (Equation 2) 

 

where wi is the initial weight,  ww is the wet weight and wf  is the final weight of the sample. 

 

2.2.6. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 

The morphology of the samples described in Chapters V and VI and CaP coatings 

described in Chapter VI were mounted on aluminium stages, sputter with gold, and analysed 

by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Leica Cambridge S-360, UK).  

 

2.2.7. Thin-film X-Ray diffraction (TF-XRD) and Fourier Transformed infrared 

spectroscopy (FTIR) 

In order to characterize the crystalline/amorphous nature of the CaP films described 

in Chapter VI, thin-film X-ray diffraction (TF-XRD, Philips X’Pert MPD, The Netherlands) was 

used. The data collection was performed by 2? scan method with 1º as the incident beam 

angle using CuK? X-Ray line and a scan speed of 0.05º/min in 2?. In addition, Infrared 

analysis (FTIR) of the coatings was performed in a Perkin- Elmer spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer 

1600 series equipment, USA) to examine the chemical structure of the obtained CaP 

biomimetic coatings (Chapter VI). Coatings were scraped from the chitosan scaffolds, mixed 

with KBr (Riedel-de Haën, Germany) and then formed into a disc in a press. All spectra were 

obtained between 4400 and 450 cm-1 at a 2 cm-1 resolution.  

 

 

 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods 

 

63 

2.2.8. Determination of lysozyme release and activity in solution  

In order to evaluate the lysozyme activity and release from the CaP coating at pH 5 

and pH 7.4 (Chapter VI), the Micrococcus lysodeikticus assay was used. This assay is based 

on the ability of lysozyme to hydrolyse the cell wall fragments of bacteria. For determining the 

activity of released lysozyme, coated scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme were immersed in 

buffer solution (pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 ºC for 30 days. The released lysozyme (150 µL) 

was added to a 100 µL of Micrococcus lysodeikticus suspension (2.3 mg/mL, pH 7.4) in a 96-

well plate. The decrease in turbidity at 37 ºC was measured at 450 nm (Microplate Reader, 

SynergyTM HT, BIO-TEK Instruments, Inc., USA) at 1 min intervals during 30 minutes. The 

same procedure was used to determine the enzyme activity at pH 5 and pH 7.4. For that, 

known enzyme concentrations were prepared in buffers at pH 5 and pH 7.4 and added to the 

bacteria suspension in the same buffer. The initial kinetic rate (OD slope at t = 0) was 

measured for each sample and a standard curve (lysozyme activity vs lysozyme 

concentration) was constructed. The activity of the lysozyme released after 30 days was 

determined from the standard curve. 

 

2.2.9. Micro-computed tomography (?-CT) analysis 

The porosity, pore interconnectivity, pore size, and 3D structures of SPCL fiber 

meshes (Chapter III) and chitosan scaffolds (Chapter VII) were analyzed before and after in 

vitro degradation by microcomputed tomography (?-CT). µ-CT was carried out with a high-

resolution ?-CT Skyscan 1072 scanner (Skyscan, Kontich, Belgium). Data sets were 

reconstructed using standardized cone-beam reconstruction software (NRecon v1.4.3, 

SkyScan). Representative data sets were segmented with a dynamic threshold of 40-255 

(grey values) and were used for morphometric analysis (CT Analyser, v1.5.1.5, SkyScan) 

and to build 3D models (ANT 3D creator, v2.4, SkyScan). The morphometric analysis 

included porosity, pore interconnectivity, mean pore size and mean fiber thickness. 3D virtual 

models of representative regions in the bulk of the scaffolds were created and registered 

using both image processing software (CT Analyser and ANT 3D creator). Further details 

can be found in Chapters III and VII.

3. IN VITRO BIOLOGICAL STUDIES 

 

3.1. Biocompatibility testing 

 

3.1.1. Cell lines  

For biocompatibility assessment of the scaffolds studied in Chapter V, two different 

cell types were used: L929 (ECACC, European Collection of Cell Cultures), a mouse 

fibroblast cell line commonly used in cytotoxicity screenings, and SaOs-2 (ATCC, American 

Type Culture Collection), a cell line derived from human osteosarcoma. L929 and osteoblast-

like SaOs-2 cell lines were selected because they are a model of a relevant cell type for the 

medical application of the implant. Both cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified 

Eagle’s Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrome) and 1% 

antibiotic/antimicotic solution. In all the experiments cells were kept in an incubator at 

constant temperature (37 ºC) and CO2 concentration (5%). 

 

3.1.2. Biocompatibility assays: extracts and cell adhesion studies 

Biocompatibility screening was performed according to ISO guidelines. Two 

categories of in vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed to evaluate scaffolds developed in 

Chapter V: extract and direct contact tests. The scaffolds, previously sterilized by ethylene 

oxide, were immersed in complete culture medium for 24 h at constant temperature (37 ºC) 

and agitation (60 rpm). L929 cells were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates (10,000 cells cm-

2), in order to reach 80% confluence in 24 h. The extracts were filtered and placed in contact 

with the monolayer of L929 cells for 72 h. A control, with cells grown in the presence of 

complete culture medium, was included. Afterwards, the viability test MTT was performed. 

Briefly, the culture medium was replaced by a solution of MTT and the cells were incubated 

for 4 h. The viable cells, those with functional mitochondrial dehydrogenase, were able to 

reduce the yellow MTT into a purple formazan product. The end product was quantified by 

spectroscopy and the results expressed as percentage of cell viability. In the direct contact 

test, scaffolds were seeded with L929 cells (8 x 104/50 ?l) and with osteoblast-like SaOs-2 

cells (5 x 105 cells/ml) for 3 and 7 days. Prior to cell seeding, the chitosan/starch scaffolds 

were immersed in DMEM culture medium overnight. This step is intended to reduce culture 

medium uptake by the highly hydrophilic materials.

3.2. Culture of rat bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) under static and flow perfusion 

conditions 

 

3.2.1. Isolation, expansion and seeding of rat MSCs 

Rat marrow stromal cells (MSCs) were harvested from the tibiae and femora of 41-44 

days old (151-175 g) male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, USA) using previously 

established methods [13]. Briefly, rats were euthanized using 4% isofluorane in CO2. The leg 

bones were excised, the soft tissue was removed and the leg bones were placed in 

Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 200 ?g/ml of penicillin 

streptomycin fungizone antibiotic cocktail (PSF). This concentration of antibiotics is 4 times 

greater than the normal concentration used in cell culture to avoid contamination during the 

harvest process. The proximal end of each femur and distal end of each tibia were clipped. 

An 18-gauge needle was inserted into the hole in the knee joint in each bone, and the bone 

was flushed with 5 ml of complete osteogenic medium [?-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal 

bovine serum (FBS) from Cambrex/BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD, USA), 50 ?g/ml 

gentamicin, 100 ?g/ml ampicilin, 10 mM fungizone, 50 ?g/ml L-ascorbic acid, 0.01 M ?-

glycerophosphate, and 10-8 M dexamethasone]. The resulting marrow pellet was broken up 

by trituration, and cell suspensions from all bones were combined in a centrifuge tube. The 

cells were plated in 75 cm2 flasks and cultured for 6 days in complete osteogenic media at 37 

ºC  in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 to allow the expansion of the cells. 

Medium was changed at 1 and 3 days to remove the non-adherent cell population. In the 

case of Chapters III and VII, after 6 days, the cells were trypsinized, centrifuged and 

resuspended in a known amount of medium with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain a 

final concentration of 3x106 cells/ml. Cells were aliquoted into cryotubes for storage (~ 1 ml 

cell suspension/crytube). Each cryotube of cells was stored at -80ºC overnight and then 

stored in liquid nitrogen. A known amount of cells were thawed and plated in 75 cm2 culture 

flasks and cultured until confluence. At the end of this primary culture period, cells were lifted 

with trypsin solution (0.25% trypsin/0.02% EDTA), centrifuged and resuspended in a known 

amount of medium. In the case of studies reported on Chapter IV, cells were not frozen. 

Scaffolds were immersed in complete osteogenic medium overnight and on the following day 

were press fit into 6 or 8 mm diameter cassettes [for chitosan-based scaffolds (Chapter VII) 

and SPCL fiber meshes (Chapters III and IV), respectively]. Cassettes were placed into 6-

well plates. Then, chitosan-based scaffolds were seeded with 280,000 cells in 100 ?l and 

SPCL fiber meshes were seeded with 500,000 cells in 300 ?l of complete osteogenic 

medium. Cells were allowed to attach for 2-3 hours before adding 10 ml of osteogenic 



CHAPTER II. Materials and methods  

66 

medium to each well of a 6-well plate. After 24 hours of attachment, the scaffolds were 

placed in new 6-well plates:  

 

i) for 7 and 15 days with 3 different media conditions: complete osteogenic media with 

(1) lipase (110 U/L) [14], (2) ?-amylase (150 U/L) [9, 14], or (3) without enzymes to study the 

degradation of SPCL fiber meshes under conditions simulating those found in vivo. Media 

were changed every 3 days. Each group consisted of n = 6 samples. This description 

corresponds to static culture conditions in Chapter III. 

  

ii) static culture condition or in a flow perfusion bioreactor for 7 and 15 days with four 

different media conditions in the presence of complete osteogenic media (1) without 

enzymes, with (2) ?-amylase (150 U/L) [10], (3) lipase (110 U/L) [14], or (4) ?-amylase and 

lipase in concentrations similar to those found in the human blood serum. Media were 

changed every 2-3 days. Each group consisted of n = 6 samples. These studies were 

performed with SPCL fiber meshes and are well described in Chapter IV. 

 

iii) for 7, 15, and 20 days with complete osteogenic medium. Media were changed 

every 3 days. Each group consisted of n = 6 samples. Chitosan scaffolds uncoated and 

coated with CaP and with and without incorporated lysozyme were used in this study. The 

results of this study are described in Chapter VII.  

 

At the end of each culture period, samples were removed from the cassettes and 

rinsed with PBS solution. Three samples from each group were stored at -20 ºC in ddH2O 

until analyses were performed. 

 

3.2.2. Analysis of cultured scaffolds 

3.2.2.1. Confocal and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 

After each time period, SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds were removed from the cassettes, 

were washed twice in PBS and were immersed in PBS with calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, 

Invitrogen, USA) for 45min for observation under laser scanning confocal microscopy (Zeiss 

LSM 510 META, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Once inside the cells, calcein-AM is 

hydrolized by endogenous esterase into the highly negatively charged green fluorescent 

calcein, which is retained inside the cytoplasm.  

Other samples were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 minutes. Then, the scaffolds were 

washed with PBS and dehydrated in graded series of ethanol, dried by

hexamethyldisilazane, mounted on aluminium stages, sputter with gold, and examined with 

an FEI Quanta 400 Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (Hillsboro, OR, USA).  

 

3.2.2.2. DNA analysis 

The cells in the constructs were lysed by repeated freeze-thaw cycles in ddH2O. The 

DNA content of the lysates was quantified by using a DNA quantification kit (Picogreen, 

Molecular Probes) and correlated to a known amount of rat marrow stromal cells. Frozen 

scaffolds were thawed at room temperature, sonicated for 10 minutes, and vortexed to allow 

cellular DNA into solution. Buffer provided with the kit was diluted with ddH2O and placed in 

each well of a 96-well plate at 100 ?l/well. DNA standard solutions in ddH2O in 

concentrations from 0-6 ?g/ml were prepared, and 50 ?l of standards/samples were added to 

each well of the 96-well plate. Picogreen dye solutions were prepared according to the 

instructions of the manufacturer using reagents provided in the kit and added at 150 ?l/well. 

All these procedures were performed in triplicate. After 10 minutes of incubation in a dark 

room, the fluorescence at 545 nm was read on a plate reader (FLx800, Bio-Tek Instruments 

Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) to determine DNA concentrations per scaffold. A conversion factor 

of 2.7 pg DNA/cell was used to calculate cell number based on MSC standards. 

 

3.2.2.3. Alkaline phosphatase activity  

Alkaline phosphatase activity assays were performed on cell lysates using an 

established protocol [15].  Briefly, all samples were prepared in triplicate and compared 

against p-nitrophenol standards. For the assay, 96-well plates were used. In each well 80 ?l 

of sample or standard, 20 ?l of buffer solution, and 100 ?l of substrate solution were added, 

and the plate was incubated for 1 hour at 37ºC. Each sample and standard was prepared in 

triplicate. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 ?l of stop solution (0.3 N NaOH). The 

standard curve was generated by preparing dilutions of p-nitrophenol (0-250 µM). 

Absorbance was read at 405 nm on a plate reader (PowerWave x340; Bio-Tek Inc., 

Winooski, VT, USA) to determine the alkaline phosphatase activity per scaffold. 

 

3.2.2.4. Calcium deposition measurements 

Calcium content in the scaffolds was measured by using a Calcium Kit (Diagnostic 

Chemical Limited). After the ALP and DNA assays, a volume of 1N acetic acid equal to the 

volume remaining in each well was added to each sample (final concentration of 0.5N), and 

the plate was placed on an orbital shaker overnight. A volume of 300 ?l of calcium assay 

reagent was added to 20 ?l of sample solution in triplicate in 96-well plates. To generate a 

standard curve, serial dilutions of calcium chloride (CaCl2) were prepared (0-50 ?g/ml).

Absorbance was read at 650 nm in a spectrophotometric plate reader (FLx800, Bio-Tek 

Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). The calcium deposition in each scaffold is reported as 

?g Ca2+. 

 

3.2.2.5. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance 

(FTIR-ATR) 

The cell/scaffold constructs after 16 days of culture were analysed by FTIR-ATR. The 

scaffolds were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and 

dried at room temperature. All spectra were recorded using 64 scans and 4 cm-1 in a FTIR 

spectrophotometer (IR Prestige-21 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, Shimadzu).  

 

3.2.2.6. Histology (H&amp;amp;E, von Kossa staining and tetracycline fluorescence) 

Light microscopy analysis was used to evaluate the morphological appearance and 

infiltration of the bone marrow stromal cells and deposited matrix. Cultured samples were 

rinsed with PBS, fixed in 10% formalin solution and embedded in HistoPrep freezing medium 

(Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Frozen sections of ~10-15 ?m thickness were 

obtained using a cryostat (HM500, Microm, Walldorf, Germany) operating at -23 ºC and 

mounted onto Superfrost Plus glass slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and 

stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) for histological evaluation. For visualization of 

mineralized tissue, additional sections were exposed to 5% silver nitrate solution under UV 

for 25 min and counterstained with 0.5% safranin O solution. Von Kossa stained sections 

were observed using a light microscope (Eclipse E600; Nikon, Melville, NY) and attached 

video camera (3CCD Color Video Camera DXC-950P; Sony, Park Ridge, NJ). Mineral 

deposition was also visualized in unstained sections under fluorescent light after adding 

tetracycline-HCl to the culture media at final concentration of 10 ?g/mL [1, 16]. All the 

histological sections, except von Kossa stained sections were visualized using Olympus 

BX61 Motorized System Microscope and attached video camera Olympus DP70 equipped 

with a fluorescence lamp.

4. IN VIVO STUDIES 

 

4.1. Implant preparation 

In Chapter VIII, scaffolds with 5 mm diameter and approximately 1.5 mm thick were 

used. All scaffolds were sterilized by ethylene oxide gas for 14 h prior to implantation. One 

day before subcutaneous implantation surgery, the implants were removed from sterile bags 

and prewetted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution in 24-well plates overnight under 

sterile conditions. The different experimental conditions evaluated in vivo were: chitosan 

scaffolds (Ch), chitosan/starch scaffolds (CS), CaP chitosan scaffolds (CaPCH), CaP 

chitosan/starch scaffolds (CaPCS), CaP chitosan scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme 

(CaPCH + lysozyme) and CaP chitosan/starch scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme (CaPCS 

+ lysozyme). 

 

4.2. Subcutaneous implantation 

All animal manipulations were approved by Rice University’s Institutional Animal Care 

and Use Comitee. Twenty four male Wistar rats 41-44 days old (Charles River Laboratories, 

USA) were used for subcutaneous implantation of acellular scaffolds. Three implantation 

periods were used: 3, 6 and 12 weeks. Animals were anesthetized with a 4% 

isoflurane/oxygen mixture, which was reduced to 2% during surgical manipulation. The rats 

were monitored to ensure that an appropriate surgical plane of anesthesia was maintained. 

Previously, the dorsum of the rat was shaved. Then, the animals were placed in a ventral 

position, the backs clipped and disinfected with povidone-iodine and six small longitudinal 

incisions were made. A pocket was created on each incision using blunt dissection, and one 

scaffold was placed in each pocket. One implant from each experimental condition was 

implanted in twenty four rats (six implants per rat). Each rat received 6 implants, 1 from each 

experimental group. A total number of 8 scaffolds per experimental group per time point were 

implanted. Previous studies reported successfully implantation of 6 materials in rat dorsal 

subcutaneous pockets using Wistar rats with similar or lower size [17-20]. The incisions have 

been closed with Vicryl 5-0 sutures. Each animal received a subcutaneous injection of sterile 

saline to aid post-operative recovery (1 ml/100 g/hour of anesthesia). Each animal received 

also a subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine (0.025 mg/kg) 8-12 hours after surgery. On 

the following day, two additional doses of buprenorphine (0.025 mg/kg) have been injected 

for continued post-operative analgesia (i.e. at 20-24 and 32-36 hours post-op). Once animals 

become active they returned to their cages. Animals were placed one per cage with water 

and food ad libitum. At each time point, animals were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation

and euthanized with carbon dioxide inhalation. The implants were retrieved after a bilateral 

thoracotomy has been performed to ensure death.  

 

4.3. Preparation of specimens for weight loss measurements and ?-CT 

After each implantation time, three scaffolds of each group condition were subjected 

to a decellularization process for weight loss measurement and micro-computed tomography 

analysis. Briefly, the scaffolds were immersed in ddH2O and placed in 24-well plate at -20 ºC. 

After that, scaffolds underwent three freeze/thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen and in a 37 ºC 

water bath, respectively, to disrupt attached cells and remove cellular debris [15]. After this 

process scaffolds were air-dried in a laminar flow hood. 

 

4.4. Histological analysis 

After euthanasia, the implants were retrieved along with the surrounding tissue and 

histologically processed. Five specimens of each group condition per time point were fixed in 

10% neutral buffered formalin until further processing. The specimens were dehydrated in 

graded series of ethanol, immersed in infiltration solutions, embedded in Technovit glycol 

methacrylate (kit 8100, Heraeus Kulzer, EBSciences, CO) and subsequently polymerized. 

Three specimens of each group condition per time period were cut to obtain longitudinal 

sections and two specimens were cut to obtain transverse sections of 7 ?m thickness using a 

modified microtome equipped with a tungsten blade (Leica RM 2155). 

Sections were stained with H&amp;amp;E to evaluate the in vivo degradation, formation of pores and 

infiltration of cells through the implants. For visualization of the CaP coating, additional 

sections were exposed to 5% silver nitrate solution under UV for 25 min and counterstained 

with 0.5% safranin O solution (von Kossa staining). All images were obtained using Olympus 

BX61 Motorized System Microscope and attached video camera Olympus DP70. Histological 

sections from all time points were scored by three observers (AMM, ARP and CMA) blinded 

for group conditions and implantation time, and reached consensus on the final score. The 

cellular ingrowth within the implants and the degradation of each sample was qualitatively 

scored based on dissolution, cracks, fragmentation on a scale modified from De Jong as 

shown in Table 1 [21].

5. STATISTICS 

Results of DNA, ALP, and calcium assay in Chapters III and VII and weight loss 

results in Chapter VI are expressed as mean ? standard deviation with n = 3 for each group. 

Statistical significance of differences was determined using Student’s t-test multiple 

comparison procedure at a confidence interval of 95% (p &amp;lt;0.05).  

Results of DNA, ALP, and calcium assay in Chapter IV and results of weight loss and 

?-CT analysis in Chapter VIII are expressed as mean ? standard deviation with n = 3 for 

each group. Also, results of histological scoring are expressed as means ? standard 

deviation with n = 4-5 for each group. Single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used 

to determine statistical significance within a data set. If ANOVA detected a significant 

difference within the data set, Tukey’s honestly significantly different (HSD) multiple 

comparison test was used to determine significant differences between groups and 

conditions. All tests were conducted with confidence interval of 95% (p &amp;lt;0.05).

The Role of Lipase and ?-Amylase in the Degradation of Starch/Poly(?-Caprolactone) 

Fiber Meshes and the Osteogenic Differentiation of Cultured Marrow Stromal Cells1 

 

ABSTRACT 

The present work studies the influence of hydrolytic enzymes (?-amylase or lipase) 

on both the degradation of fiber mesh scaffolds based on a blend of starch with poly(?-

caprolactone) (SPCL) and the osteogenic differentiation of rat marrow stromal cells (MSCs) 

and subsequent formation of extracellular matrix (ECM) on these scaffolds under static 

culture conditions. The biodegradation profile of SPCL fiber meshes was investigated using 

enzymes that are specifically responsible for the enzymatic hydrolysis of SPCL using 

concentrations similar to those found in human serum. These degradation studies were 

performed using both static and dynamic conditions. After several degradation periods (3, 7, 

14, 21, and 30 days) weight loss measurements and micro-Computed Tomography (?-CT) 

analysis (specifically porosity, interconnectivity, mean pore size and fiber thickness) were 

performed. The SPCL scaffolds were seeded with rat MSCs and cultured for 8 and 16 days 

using complete osteogenic media with and without enzymes (?-amylase or lipase). Results 

indicate that culture medium supplemented with enzymes enhanced cell proliferation after 16 

days of culture as compared with samples cultured without enzymes. With respect to the 

calcium content of the constructs, no calcium was detected in scaffolds cultured with ?-

amylase or without enzymes after each time period. However, SPCL scaffolds cultured with 

lipase presented calcium deposition after the 8th day, showing a significant increase at the 

16th day. Lipase appears to positively influence osteoblastic differentiation of rat MSCs and to 

enhance matrix mineralization. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy images showed 

that the enzymes do not have a deleterious effect on the 3D structure of SPCL fiber meshes, 

meaning that the scaffolds after 16 days did not lose their structural integrity. Confocal 

micrographs have shown cells to be evenly distributed and infiltrated within the SPCL fiber 

meshes up to 410 ?m from the surface. This study demonstrates that supplementation of

culture media with lipase holds great potential for the generation of bone tissue engineering 

constructs from MSCs seeded onto SPCL fiber meshes, as lipase enhances the osteoblastic 

differentiation of the seeded MSCs and promotes matrix mineralization without deleteriously 

affecting the structural integrity of the meshes over 16 days of culture. 

 

1. INTRODUCTION 

Tissue engineering, as it was defined by Langer and Vacanti (1) in 1993, “is an 

interdisciplinary field of research that applies the principles of engineering and the life 

sciences towards the development of biological substitutes that restore, maintain or improve 

tissue function.” Specific tissue engineering applications, such as bone regeneration, often 

need a temporary scaffold with a three-dimensional architecture to support tissue growth. 

The ideal scaffold should be biodegradable and bioresorbable to support the growth of new 

bone.  The scaffold degradation rate should complement the growth rate of the new bone in 

a manner that, by the time the defect/injury site is completely regenerated, the scaffold is 

totally degraded (1, 2). Biodegradable materials have the capacity to temporarily mimic the 

original structural function of the tissue and to degrade by controlled mechanisms into 

products easily eliminated by the body’s metabolic pathways (3). In this perspective, we used 

enzymes present in human serum that are responsible for the enzymatic degradation of 

starch and poly(?-caprolactone) (SPCL) (?-amylase and lipase, respectively) in order to 

simulate conditions found in vivo. In this study, we used SPCL, a blend of starch with poly(?-

caprolactone). Starch itself is one of the most abundant naturally occurring polymers, 

presenting a combination of attractive properties that is increasingly advancing its use in a 

variety of applications. Starch-based biomaterials are biocompatible (4, 5) and biodegradable 

(6, 7). Studies with starch-based scaffolds showed that their degradation products do not 

have a negative effect on human osteosarcoma cells (SaOS-2 cell line) (8). Previous studies 

with SPCL fiber meshes have also shown that these scaffolds were able to support the 

attachment, proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) (9, 10). 

Biomaterials based on starch degrade by ?-amylase. In principle, the in vivo resorption rate 

of blends based on starch can be regulated by controlling the percentage of starch in the 

material, preferentially attacked by enzymatic hydrolysis. 

PCL is a biodegradable aliphatic polyester currently used in an array of biomedical 

applications. Several studies have reported that PCL is degraded by lipase (11-14). Lipases 

are water-soluble enzymes that hydrolyze ester bonds of water soluble substrates such as 

triglycerides, phospholipids and cholesteryl esters (15, 16). The lipase gene family consists

Osteogenic Differentiation of Cultured Marrow Stromal Cells  

 

81 

of multiple lipases that share a similar sequence structure at the genetic and protein level 

thus indicating a common ancestral origin. However, these lipases have disparate and organ 

specific expression, indicating that they may have evolved relatively specific roles. The 

human lipases include the pre-duodenal lingual and gastric lipase and the extra-duodenal 

pancreatic, hepatic, lipoprotein (LPL) and endothelial lipase (17). The pancreatic, hepatic, 

lipoprotein and endothelial lipase are members of the lipase gene family (17). Lipoprotein 

lipase has been described as a marker of adipogenic differentiation (18-20). Serum lipase is 

mainly derived from pancreatic cells, while other sources in the human body are the digestive 

track, adipose tissue, lung, milk and leucocytes (3, 21). Several authors have described 

different enzymatic effects of lipase on PCL using species of lipase obtained from diverse 

sources (12, 13). The experimental results obtained with lipase seem to be influenced by 

enzyme characteristics such as source and specificity. Some studies have also reported that 

the biodegradation rate of PCL depends on the shape and inherent surface/volume ratio of 

the PCL substrate, with films being slowly degraded, while nano/microparticles are very 

quickly degraded (13).   

Previous studies using static and dynamic (flow perfusion bioreactor) culture 

conditions for rat marrow stromal cells on SPCL fiber meshes have shown that flow perfusion 

conditions enhance differentiation of marrow stromal cells with subsequent formation of a 

bone-like extracellular matrix (9, 10). Holtorf et al. (22) showed that flow perfusion culture 

induced osteoblastic differentiation of rat marrow stromal cells seeded on scaffolds, even in 

the absence of dexamethasone (a glucocorticoid media supplement that promotes 

osteoblastic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells in culture).  

In this work we propose a novel approach, using static cultures and complete 

osteogenic media supplemented with enzymes to study simultaneously the influence of ?-

amylase and lipase on the degradation of SPCL fiber meshes as a function of immersion 

time and on the osteodifferentiation of rat marrow stromal cells. 

This work intends to mimic in vitro the in vivo degradation of the SPCL fiber meshes 

using enzymes responsible for their degradation at the same concentrations as those found 

in human serum. Besides characterizing the susceptibility of SPCL fiber meshes to 

enzymatic degradation, this study aims also to investigate the osteogenic differentiation of rat 

marrow stromal cells (MSCs) and subsequent formation of extracellular matrix (ECM) under 

static conditions in the presence of hydrolytic enzymes (lipase or ?-amylase). By seeding rat 

MSCs onto SPCL fiber meshes and culturing them under static conditions using osteogenic 

media supplemented with lipase and ?-amylase enzymes, we aimed to answer the following

82 

questions: 1) What is the role of lipase and ?-amylase in the degradation of SPCL fiber mesh 

scaffolds? 2) Is the integrity of SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds rapidly compromised by enzymatic 

degradation, and if so, which enzyme is the most influential? 3) Is there any effect of ?-

amylase and lipase on the osteogenic differentiation of rat marrow stromal cells? 

 

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  

2.1. Scaffolds preparation and characterization 

Porous scaffolds used in this study were based on a blend of corn starch and poly (?-

caprolactone) (SPCL, 30/70 %) prepared by a fiber bonding technique (9). Scaffolds were 

cylinders with 8 mm diameters and heights of 1-1.5 mm. Prior to cell seeding, scaffolds were 

sterilized by ethylene oxide gas for 14 hours. All chemical reagents were purchased from 

Sigma (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise specified. 

 

2.2. Degradation tests 

Serum ?-amylase and serum lipase in healthy adults are in range of 46-244 U/L (3, 23) 

and 30-190 U/L (3, 24), respectively. Degradation studies were carried out by incubating 

samples in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution (0.1M, pH 7.4) containing ?-amylase 

(150 U/L) (3, 23) from Baccillus sp. or lipase (110 U/L) (3, 24) from Aspergillus niger, both 

concentrations similar to those found in human serum, and sodium azide (0.2%), to avoid 

contaminations, at 37ºC up to 30 days under static and dynamic conditions (shaker at 70 

rpm). The studies were performed in triplicate. The enzymatic degradation solutions were 

changed every 7 days to restore the original level of enzymatic activity.  At the end of the 

degradation period, the samples were removed, washed thoroughly with distilled water and 

dried in a graded series of ethanol for later calculation of weight loss (1).

2.3. Micro-Computed  Tomography (?-CT) 

The scaffolds (n=3) were analysed using micro-Computed Tomography (?-CT) before 

and after degradation with both enzymes (lipase or ?-amylase) for the different periods of 

immersion (0, 3, 14 and 21 days) in both static and dynamic conditions. ?-CT was carried out 

with a high-resolution ?-CT Skyscan 1072 scanner (Skyscan, Kontich, Belgium) using a 

resolution of pixel size of 8.79 ?m and integration time of 1.9 ms. The X-ray source was set 

at 40 keV of energy and 250 ?A of current. Approximately 400 projections were acquired 

over a rotation range of 180° with a rotation step of 0.45°. Data sets were reconstructed 

using standardized cone-beam reconstruction software (NRecon v1.4.3, SkyScan). The 

output format for each sample was 300 serial 1024x1024 bitmap images. Representative 

data sets of 200 slices were segmented into binary images with a dynamic threshold of 40-

255 (grey values) and were used for morphometric analysis (CT Analyser, v1.5.1.5, 

SkyScan) and to build 3D models (ANT 3D creator, v2.4, SkyScan). The morphometric 

analysis included porosity, pore interconnectivity, mean pore size and mean fiber thickness. 

3D virtual models of representative regions in the bulk of the scaffolds were created, 

visualized and registered using both image processing softwares (CT Analyser and ANT 3D 

creator). 

 

2.4. Isolation and expansion of rat bone marrow stromal cells  

Rat marrow stromal cells (MSCs) were harvested from the tibiae and femora of 41-44 

days old (151-175 g) male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, USA) using established 

methods (25).  Briefly, rats were euthanized using 4% isofluorane in CO2. The leg bones 

were excised, the soft tissue was removed and the leg bones were placed in Dulbecco's 

Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 200 ?g/ml of penicillin streptomycin 

fungizone antibiotic cocktail (PSF). This concentration of antibiotics is 4 times greater than 

the normal concentration used in cell culture to avoid contamination during the harvest 

process. The proximal end of each femur and distal end of each tibia were clipped. An 18-

gauge needle was inserted into the hole in the knee joint in each bone, and the bone was 

flushed with 5 ml of complete osteogenic medium [?-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal 

bovine serum (FBS) from Cambrex/BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD), 50 ?g/ml gentamicin, 

100 ?g/ml ampicilin, 10 mM fungizone, 50 ?g/ml L-ascorbic acid, 0.01 M ?-glycerophosphate, 

and 10-8 M dexamethasone]. The resulting marrow pellet was broken up by trituration, and 

cell suspensions from all bones were combined in a centrifuge tube.

The cells were plated in 75 cm2 flasks and cultured for 6 days in complete osteogenic 

media at 37 ºC  in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 to allow the expansion of the 

cells. Medium was changed at 1 and 3 days to remove the non-adherent cell population. 

After 6 days, the cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, resuspended in a known amount of 

medium and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain a final concentration of 3x106 cells/ml. 

Cells were aliquoted into cryotubes for storage (~ 1 ml cell suspension/ crytube).  Each 

cryotube of cells was stored at -80ºC overnight and then stored in liquid nitrogen.  

 

2.5. Cell seeding 

A known amount of cells were thawed and plated in 75 cm2 culture flasks and 

cultured until confluence. At the end of this primary culture period, cells were lifted with 

trypsin solution (0.25% trypsin/0.02% EDTA), centrifuged and resuspended in a known 

amount of medium. 

SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds were immersed in complete osteogenic medium overnight 

and were pressed fit into 8 mm diameter cassettes on the following day. Cassettes were 

placed into 6-well plates. Then, SPCL scaffolds were seeded with 500,000 cells in 300 ?l of 

complete osteogenic medium. Cells were allowed to attach for 3 hours before adding 10 ml 

of osteogenic medium to each well of a 6-well plate. After 24 hours of attachment, the 

scaffolds were placed in new 6-well plates for 7 and 15 days with 3 different media 

conditions: complete osteogenic media with (1) lipase (110 U/L), (2) ?-amylase (150 U/L), or 

(3) without enzymes to study the degradation of SPCL fiber meshes under conditions 

simulating those found in vivo. Media were changed every 3 days. Each group consisted of n 

= 6 samples.  

 

2.6. DNA analysis 

The cells in the cell/scaffold constructs were lysed by freeze-thaw in ddH2O. The DNA 

content of the lysates was quantified by using a DNA quantification kit (Picogreen, Molecular 

Probes) and correlating to a known amount of rat marrow stromal cells. Frozen scaffolds 

were thawed at room temperature, sonicated for 10 minutes, and vortexed to allow cellular 

DNA into solution.  Buffer provided with the kit was diluted with ddH2O and placed in each 

well of a 96-well plate at 100 ?l/well. DNA standard solutions in ddH2O in concentrations from 

0-6 ?g/ml were prepared, and 50 ?l of standards/samples were added to each well of the 96-

well plate. Picogreen dye solutions were prepared according the instructions of the

manufacturer using reagents provided in the kit and added at 150 ?l/well. All these 

procedures were performed in triplicate. After 10 minutes of incubation in a dark room, the 

fluorescence at 545 nm was read on a plate reader (FLx800, Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., 

Winooski, Vermont) to determine DNA concentrations per scaffold. A conversion factor of 2.7 

pg DNA/cell was used to calculate cell number based on MSC standards. 

 

2.7. Alkaline phosphatase activity 

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was determined using an established protocol 

(26) by measuring the conversion of p-nitrophenylphosphate to p-nitrophenol. All reagents 

were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). For the assay, 96-well plates were used. In 

each well 80 ?l of sample or standard, 20 ?l of buffer solution, and 100 ?l of substrate 

solution were added, and the plate was incubated for 1 hour at 37ºC. Each sample and 

standard was prepared in triplicate. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 ?l of stop 

solution (0.3 N NaOH). The standard curve was generated by preparing dilutions of p-

nitrophenol (0-250 µM). Absorbance was read at 405 nm on a plate reader to determine 

enzyme concentration per construct. 

 

2.8. Calcium deposition measurement 

Calcium content in the SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds was measured by using a Calcium 

Kit (Diagnostic Chemical Limited). After the ALP and DNA assays, a volume of 1N acetic 

acid equal to the volume remaining in each well was added to each well (final concentration 

of 0.5N), and the plate was placed on an orbital shaker overnight. A volume of 300 ?l of 

calcium assay reagent was added to 20 ?l of sample solution in triplicate in 96-well plates. To 

generate a standard curve, serial dilutions of CaCl2 were prepared (0-50 ?g/ml). Absorbance 

was read at 650 nm in a spectrophotometric plate reader. The calcium deposition in each 

scaffold is reported as ?g Ca2+. 

 

2.9. Microscopic analysis 

After each time period, SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds were removed from the cassettes, 

washed with PBS and stained with calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) according to the 

manufacturer’s instructions. To visualize the distribution of cells within the scaffolds, after 45

minutes of immersion in PBS with calcein-AM, images were recorded using a laser scanning 

confocal microscope with a 10X APO objective (Zeiss LSM 510 Axiovert, Carl Zeiss, 

Germany). Depth projections of the surface (up to 410 ?m) were obtained and the cells were 

colored as a function of their distance from the surface. 

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to evaluate the morphological 

appearance of the rat bone marrow cells. Samples for SEM analysis were washed twice in 

PBS and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 minutes. Then, the scaffolds were washed 

with PBS and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and dried by hexamethyldisilazane. 

 

2.10. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance 

(FTIR-ATR) 

The cell/scaffold constructs after 16 days of culture were analysed by FTIR-ATR. The 

scaffolds were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and 

dried at room temperature. All spectra were recorded using 64 scans and 4 cm-1 in a FTIR 

spectrophotometer (IR Prestige-21 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, Shimadzu).  

 

 2.11. Statistics 

Results of DNA, ALP, and calcium assay are expressed as mean ? standard deviation with 

n=3 for each group. Statistical significance of differences was determined using Student’s t-

test multiple comparison procedure at a confidence interval of 95% (p &amp;lt;0.05).  

 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1. Degradation studies 

The main aims of the degradation studies were to simulate physiological conditions 

using enzymes present in human serum that would be responsible for enzymatic hydrolysis 

of SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds in vivo, to control and tailor the degradation rate of the SPCL 

scaffolds, and finally to evaluate the possibility of increasing their porosity and pore 

interconnectivity through degradation.

SPCL is a blend of starch with poly(?-caprolactone). In this study, scaffolds based on 

SPCL were prepared by a fiber bonding process that uses heat to promote the bonding of 

the fibers previously obtained by melt-spinning (9).  

When analysing weight loss profiles using ?-amylase and lipase, few differences 

were observed between static and dynamic conditions for each enzyme (Figure 1). One of 

the enzymes responsible for starch hydrolysis is ?-amylase. The scaffolds immersed in ?-

amylase presented the highest weight loss as compared with lipase. In presence of this 

enzyme it was observed after 3 days a weight loss of approximately 25%, which slightly 

increases to 30% weight loss upon 30 days of immersion (Figure 1). Nevertheless, 

immersion periods up to 30 days did not cause the scaffolds to lose their structural integrity. 

These observed results are in agreement with previous studies using ?-amylase (3, 7).  

Lipase is an enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of ester bonds in polyesters, and 

some studies have shown that lipase enhances PCL degradation (7, 27, 28). PCL is a 

hydrophobic crystalline polymer that degrades very slowly in vitro in the absence of enzymes 

and in vivo as well. The in vitro degradation can be enhanced in the presence of the enzyme 

lipase (28). The values of weight loss in the presence of lipase are not so pronounced 

compared with those obtained in presence of ?-amylase but these values are in agreement 

with other studies (27). Weight loss remains constant up to 21 days, slightly increasing after 

afterward (Figure 1). The enzymatic degradation of PCL by lipase has been reported by 

several studies (11-14, 29). It is apparent from Figure 1 that the degradation of SPCL occurs 

in the presence of lipase, this enzyme being responsible for only 7.7 ? 1.6 % weight loss 

after 30 days of immersion under dynamic conditions. These results are in accordance with 

several published studies (12, 13). Hoshino et al. (12) showed the influence of different 

commercially available lipases on degradation of PCL. They presented the results of 

biodegradability of PCL films after 100 days incubation at 37º C and some commercial lipase 

species were able to degrade PCL completely, namely from alcaligenes sp., Rhizopus 

niveus, Rhizopus oryzae, Chromobacterium viscosum and Candida rugosa. However, they 

presented different results with other lipases that showed values of weight loss below 5%, as 

when using the same lipase employed in this study - Aspergillus niger. These results are in 

accordance with the weight loss after 30 days reported here. In contrast to its slow hydrolytic 

degradation, other studies with PCL showed high values of weight loss during enzymatic 

degradation when using Pseudomonas cepacia lipase, which has a specific activity on PCL 

segment degradation (14).

It is obvious that ?-amylase and lipase contributed to different degrees to the 

degradation of the SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds and the studies presented here with ?-amylase 

show that this enzyme is responsible for higher values of weight loss as compared to the 

ones obtained with lipase (Figure 1).   

 

Figure 1. Weight loss profile (pH 7.4, 37ºC) of SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds using ?-amylase (150 U/L) 

and lipase (110 U/L) under static and dynamic conditions up to 30 days. 

 

The morphological changes induced by degradation with these enzymes can be 

further confirmed by virtual 3D models obtained by ?-CT, where it can be seen that SPCL 

fiber mesh scaffolds were affected by ?-amylase and lipase (Figure 2). However, as 

confirmed by weight loss results, ?-amylase had a great effect in SPCL fiber meshes mainly 

at day 21 (Figure 2K) and day 30 (Figure 2F and 2L).   In Figure 3, it is possible to observe 

the 3D virtual models obtained by ?-CT as a function of immersion time in PBS using lipase 

solution.  The effect of lipase is not so pronounced as compared with images obtained after 

degradation with ?-amylase, nevertheless slight changes in SPCL fiber meshes were 

observed as a function of immersion time (Figure 3).

applies to all images. 

 

SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds before degradation presented an average porosity of 59.8 

? 2.6 % (Figure 4A), with approximately 97% pore interconnectivity (Figure 4B). According to 

Figure 4A, it is possible to see that both degradation conditions (lipase and ?-amylase) 

enhance the porosity of the scaffolds. Porosity results (Figure 4A) show that both enzymes

(lipase and ?-amylase) have a significant effect on SPCL degradation as a function of 

degradation time. When lipase was used a significant increase in porosity was observed as a 

function of immersion time using dynamic conditions compared with control samples. 

Furthermore, a significant difference in porosity was obtained using lipase and dynamic 

conditions compared to results obtained with the same enzyme using static conditions. 

Lipase seems to be influenced by agitation (dynamic conditions) as seen in Figure 4A, the 

porosity increases when compared with both control samples and static conditions. In 

addition, no effect of lipase upon SPCL porosity using static conditions was observed. 

In contrast with results obtained with lipase, ?-amylase has a significant effect on 

SPCL degradation using either static or dynamic conditions (Figure 4A). Moreover, results 

when ?-amylase was used, show that all time periods (except day 30 using dynamic 

conditions) under static or dynamic conditions presented a significant increase in porosity 

when compared with control samples (Figure 4A). The effect of ?-amylase on porosity seems 

to be independent of using static or dynamic conditions, being obvious when analysing 

Figure 4A. When comparing results obtained after degradation with lipase or ?-amylase for 

the same period of time, a significant increase in porosity was observed only for the 3rd and 

7th day using ?-amylase in static conditions. Some differences can be observed between 

static and dynamic conditions for both enzymes: the positive effect of lipase on the porosity 

of the scaffolds is higher for dynamic conditions, while the effect of ?-amylase on porosity 

appears to be less dependent on the circulation (static/dynamic) of the degrading media 

(Figure 4A).  

The interconnectivity of SPCL scaffolds before degradation is very high (around 

97%), and for all periods, the interconnectivity increases both under static and dynamic 

conditions with ?-amylase (Figure 4B), although such differences are not easily perceptible 

through visual inspection due to the high range of interconnectivity. The same trend was 

observed for lipase (Figure 4B), and no significant differences were observed. However, the 

interconnectivity when ?-amylase or lipase was used seems to be influenced by dynamic 

conditions. 

The average pore size also increases upon degradation with lipase. According to 

porosity results (Figure 4A) the same trend is observed for pore size when lipase is used 

(Figure 5A). The pore size increase upon degradation with lipase is more pronounced for 

dynamic conditions (Figure 5A), being significantly different when compared with control 

samples or static conditions (Figure 5A). In this respect, dynamic conditions enhance the 

size of the pores (Figure 5A) relative to static conditions. As observed in Figure 4A, static

Osteogenic Differentiation of Cultured Marrow Stromal Cells  

92 

conditions seem to not interfere with the size of pores when lipase was used (Figure 5A).  

The pore size of the scaffolds increases upon degradation with ?-amylase as compared with 

control samples, however this difference is only significant for the 7th and 14th day either 

using static or dynamic conditions. A significant increase in pore size is also observed when 

?-amylase was used in static conditions when compared with lipase (7th and 14th day).  

The thickness of the fibers remains more or less constant using lipase (Figure 5B), 

which supports the low weight loss observed for lipase degradation media (Figure 1).  No 

significant differences are observed between static or dynamic conditions. ?-amylase 

decreases the thickness of the fibers both using static and dynamic conditions compared 

with control samples as a function of time. It is evident that fiber diameter decreases upon 

degradation with ?-amylase, however differences between static and dynamic conditions are 

not significant, except for the 3rd day of degradation using dynamic conditions. Comparing the 

action of lipase and ?-amylase on fiber thickness, it is possible to observe a significant 

decrease when lipase was used under either static or dynamic conditions.

compared with lipase (except at day 21 using static conditions). 

 

3.2. Assays 

The results of scaffold cellularity are presented in Figure 6. The DNA assay showed a 

significant increase (p&lt;0.05) in late cell proliferation for SPCL fiber meshes that were 

cultured with osteogenic medium with lipase or ?-amylase.  After 16 days the number of cells 

from scaffolds cultured with enzymes was much higher than the scaffolds cultured without 

enzymes, their cellularity increased 3-5 times between day 8 and day 16 of culture. In 

contrast, the DNA results showed a non-significant decrease in cell proliferation after 16 days 

for SPCL scaffolds cultured in static cultures without enzymes in agreement with previous 

experiments (9, 10). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images confirm these results. A

significant improvement of cell proliferation on the surface of SPCL fiber meshes cultured 

with enzymes is apparent (Figure 7).

Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme expressed by cells and is an early marker of 

osteoblastic differentiation. The alkaline phosphatase expression showed highest values at 

day 8 of culture for all conditions (Figure 8). According to Figure 8, ALP activity without 

enzymes (control) is significantly higher than in groups with enzymes. Usually a maximum 

value of ALP coincides with early osteoblastic differentiation of marrow stromal cells. There 

was a significant difference between the scaffolds cultured with and without enzymes for 

each time period. The presence of each enzyme decreased the ALP activity with respect to 

the control. All conditions presented a decrease of ALP at day 16, which was expected as 

after this period, ALP activity usually decreases and mineralization starts to take place (9).

mesh scaffolds with lipase, ?-amylase and without enzymes for up to 16 days. Results are expressed

between conditions at the same time point. (**) indicates a significant difference (p &amp;lt;0.05) between 8 

and 16 days for each condition. 

 

The decrease of ALP expression when lipase was added to the culture medium 

(Figure 8) is related to an increase in calcium deposition (Figure 9). The production of a 

mineralized matrix is considered the endpoint in the osteoblastic differentiation of marrow 

stromal cells. Previous studies presented low levels of calcium deposition in static cultures 

(9, 10). After calcium deposition measurements, no calcium was detected in scaffolds 

cultured with ?-amylase or without enzymes after both time periods. However, SPCL fiber 

mesh scaffolds cultured with lipase presented calcium deposition after day 8 with a

significant increase after 16 days (p&lt;0.05). These values obtained for calcium deposition 

were similar (22, 30) or higher (31, 32) when compared with previous studies conducted in 

static cultures using different fiber meshes. Lipase seems to positively influence osteoblastic 

differentiation of rat marrow stromal cells and enhance matrix mineralization.

between conditions after 16 days of culture. 

 

Figure 10 presents different images obtained by laser scanning confocal microscopy 

showing that cells are viable, well spread and cover the entire surface of the fibers at day 8

The images presented in Figure 11 were obtained from depth projections of SPCL 

fiber meshes after 16 days and show the infiltration of cells to a depth of 410 ?m for all 

culture conditions and the presence of monolayers of cells covering the fibers.

3.3. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-

ATR) 

In this study, FTIR-ATR spectra were obtained from SPCL cultured for 16 days under 

static conditions with and without enzymes (?-amylase or lipase). This method was used as 

a complement to the calcium assay.  When ?-amylase or lipase were added to osteogenic 

media, it was possible to see  bands centered at 1650 and 1542 cm-1 that can be attributed 

to amide I and amide II. The amide I band represents the stretching vibrations of C=O bonds 

in the backbone of the proteins (33).  Furthermore, the amide II band arises from the 

combination of C-N stretching and N-H bending vibrations of the protein backbone (33). 

Analysing the spectra when enzymes were added to culture media, it is possible to detect 

amide I and amide II bands, which confirms that these enzymes were able to adsorb to the 

SPCL fiber mesh surfaces. In addition, these bands can be correlated to the protein matrix 

formation. Moreover, phosphate bands located at 1020 cm-1 similar to the ones found in 

carbonate apatite were observed in SPCL fiber meshes cultured with lipase, clearly 

suggesting the presence of mineralized extracellular matrix and corroborating the results 

obtained from the calcium assay.

4. CONCLUSIONS 

This study demonstrates the effect of lipase and ?-amylase on degradation of SPCL 

fiber mesh scaffolds, showing that after 30 days these enzymes did not have a negative 

effect on SPCL fiber integrity. The positive effect of lipase on the porosity and size of pores 

was clearly visible when dynamic conditions were used. Porosity, pore size and fiber 

thickness were also enhanced by ?-amylase. However, no significant differences were 

observed under static and dynamic conditions, when ?-amylase solution was used. SPCL 

fiber meshes cultured with media supplemented with ?-amylase or lipase revealed that these 

enzymes promoted the proliferation of rat marrow stromal cells. Furthermore, this study 

confirms by calcium content measurement and FTIR analysis that lipase has a superior 

effect in osteodifferentiation of rat marrow stromal cells and promotes extracellular matrix 

mineralization when added to osteogenic culture medium as compared with results obtained 

without enzymes or with ?-amylase.  These results demonstrate that supplementation of 

culture media with lipase holds great potential for the generation of bone tissue engineering 

constructs from MSCs seeded onto SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds, as lipase enhances the 

osteoblastic differentiation of the seeded MSCs and promotes matrix mineralization without 

deleteriously affecting the structural integrity of the meshes over 16 days of culture.

Combination of Enzymes and Flow Perfusion Conditions Improves Osteogenic 

Differentiation of Bone Marrow Stromal Cells Cultured upon Starch/Poly(?-

Caprolactone) Fiber Meshes1 

 

ABSTRACT 

Previous studies have shown that ?-amylase and lipase are capable of enhancing the 

degradation of fiber meshes of blends of starch and poly(?-caprolactone) (SPCL) under 

dynamic conditions, and consequently to promote the proliferation and osteogenic 

differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs). This study investigated the effect of flow 

perfusion bioreactor culture in combination with enzymes such as ?-amylase and lipase on 

the osteogenic differentiation of rat MSCs. SPCL fiber meshes were seeded with rat MSCs 

and cultured with osteogenic medium supplemented with ?-amylase, lipase or a combination 

of the two for 8 or 16 days using both static or fluid flow perfusion conditions. It was found 

that lipase and its combination with ?-amylase enhanced cell proliferation after 16 days.  In 

addition, the flow perfusion culture enhanced the infiltration of cells and facilitated greater 

distribution of extracellular matrix throughout the scaffolds in the presence/absence of 

enzymes. A significant amount of calcium was detected after 16 days in all groups cultured in 

flow perfusion conditions compared with static cultures. Nevertheless, when ?-amylase and 

lipase were included in the flow perfusion cultures, the calcium content was 379 ± 30 

?g/scaffold after as few as 8 days. The highest calcium content (1271 ± 32 ?g/scaffold) was 

obtained for SPCL/cell constructs cultured for 16 days in the presence of lipase and flow. 

Furthermore, von Kossa staining and tetracycline fluorescence of histological sections 

demonstrated mineral deposition within the scaffolds for all groups cultured for 16 days under 

flow perfusion conditions. However, all the data corroborate that lipase coupled with flow 

perfusion conditions improve the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and enhance 

extracellular matrix mineralization.

1. INTRODUCTION 

An ideal scaffold for bone tissue engineering should be biodegradable and 

bioresorbable while being able to support the growth of new bone.  The scaffold degradation 

rate should complement the growth rate of the new bone  such that the scaffold degrades in 

time for the new bone to occupy the site of defect or injury.1 In the case of starch and poly(?-

caprolactone)  (SPCL) scaffolds2,3, ?-amylase4-8 and lipase5,9,10  have been shown to facilitate 

the enzymatic hydrolysis of the starch and PCL components of the scaffold, respectively. 

Additionally, studies have also shown pronounced degradation of SPCL biomaterials when 

lipase and ?-amylase were used together.5,6 Since these enzymes are naturally present in 

humans, lipase and ?-amylase were used in this study at human blood serum concentrations 

to simulate in vivo conditions. In vitro, these enzymes have previously induced the 

degradation of SPCL scaffolds under static as well as dynamic conditions, as is indicated by 

the enhanced porosity and pore size of the scaffolds. In addition, the presence of these 

enzymes in culture media has induced the proliferation of rat marrow stromal cells cultured 

on SPCL scaffolds.  

In this study we were interested in examining the osteogenic potential of ?-amylase 

and lipase when added to osteogenic culture media in flow perfusion culture of MSCs. The 

osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in vitro starts with a period of cellular proliferation, 

followed by extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and maturation, and ultimately 

mineralization of the matrix.11,12 To induce osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, the culture 

medium is typically supplemented with osteogenic agents such as ascorbic acid, ?-

glycerophosphate, and dexamethasone. To further facilitate osteogenesis, growth factors 

such as BMP-2 and BMP-4 have been added to culture media.  However, most studies do 

not take into account the effect of physiological enzymes on cellular differentiation and 

scaffold degradation; two events that are integral to designing successful strategies for bone 

tissue engineering. For example, a previous study in our laboratory described that lipase 

positively influences osteoblastic differentiation of rat MSCs and enhances matrix 

mineralization under static conditions when added to osteogenic culture medium. Previous 

studies with SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds using flow perfusion bioreactors have shown that 

flow perfusion conditions enhanced osteoblastic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal 

cells (MSCs)2,3 due to the improved mass transport to the scaffold interior13 and to the 

mechanical stimulation of cells caused by the fluid shear force within the scaffold.14 

Due to previous promising results indicating the osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs  

in the presence of lipase under static conditions, it was hypothesized in the present study 

that the addition of mechanical stimulation of MSCs via fluid flow in the bioreactor would

enhance osteogenesis of MSCs in the presence of enzymes such as lipase and ?-amylase at 

physiological concentrations. Specifically, this study was designed to investigate the 

following: (1) The efficacy of ?-amylase and/or lipase enzymes as osteogenic supplements in 

culture media for osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells and (2) the effect 

of lipase and ?-amylase at physiological concentrations, in combination with flow perfusion 

conditions, on the osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells. 

 

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  

2.1. Scaffold preparation  

Blends of corn starch and poly(?-caprolactone) (SPCL, 30/70%) fiber mesh scaffolds 

were prepared by a fiber bonding technique with a porosity of 60 ± 3% and an average fiber 

diameter of 226 ± 1 ?m. The porosity and fiber diameter were determined using micro-

computed tomography (?-CT) as previously described.8 The average pore size was 339 ± 31 

?m.8 Scaffolds were die-punched into 8 mm diameter discs (thickness = 1-1.5 mm). Further 

details on the scaffolds can be found elsewhere.2,3 Prior to cell seeding, scaffolds were 

sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide gas for 14 hours. All chemical reagents were 

purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA), unless otherwise specified. 

 

2.2. Isolation, expansion and seeding of rat bone marrow stromal cells  

Rat bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) were obtained from femura and tibiae of 41-44 

day-old male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, USA) using the method described by 

Maniatoupoulos et al.15 The harvested cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere with 

5% CO2 at 37ºC until they were confluent. Medium was changed at 1 and 3 days to remove 

the non-adherent cell population.  

SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds were immersed in complete osteogenic medium [?-MEM 

supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) from Cambrex/BioWhittaker (Walkersville, 

MD, USA), 50 ?g/mL gentamicin, 100 ?g/mL ampicilin, 10 mM fungizone, 50 ?g/mL L-

ascorbic acid, 0.01 M ?-glycerophosphate, and 10-8 M dexamethasone] overnight and were 

press fit into 8 mm diameter cassettes on the following day. Cassettes were placed into 6-

well plates. Each scaffold was seeded with 500,000 cells in 300 ?l of complete osteogenic 

medium as described previously.8 Cells were allowed to attach for 2 hours before adding 10 

ml of osteogenic medium to each well of the 6-well plate. After 24 hours of attachment, the

Stromal Cells Cultured upon Starch/Poly(?-Caprolactone) Fiber Meshes 

108 

scaffolds were placed in new 6-well plates (static culture condition) or in a flow perfusion 

bioreactor for 7 and 15 days with four different media conditions; specifically, complete 

osteogenic media (i) without enzymes, (ii) with ?-amylase (150 U/L)8,16, (iii) with lipase (110 

U/L)8,17, or (iv) with ?-amylase and lipase in concentrations similar to those found in human 

blood serum. 

Media were changed every 2-3 days. Each group consisted of n = 6 samples. At the 

end of each culture period, samples were removed from the cassettes and rinsed with 

phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. Three samples from each group were stored at -

20ºC in ddH2O for biochemical analysis. The remaining samples were fixed with 2.5% 

glutaraldehyde for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis or with 10% formalin 

solution for histological evaluation.  

 

2.3. DNA analysis 

The cells in the constructs were lysed by repeated freeze-thaw cycles in ddH2O. The 

DNA content of the lysates was quantified by using a DNA quantification kit (PicoGreen, 

Molecular Probes) and correlated to DNA from a known amount of rat marrow stromal cells. 

Frozen scaffolds were thawed at room temperature, sonicated for 10 minutes, and vortexed 

to allow cellular DNA into solution.  Buffer provided with the kit was diluted with ddH2O and 

placed in each well of a 96-well plate at 100 ?l/well. DNA standard solutions in ddH2O in 

concentrations from 0-6 ?g/ml were prepared, and 50 ?l of standards/samples were added to 

each well of the 96-well plate. PicoGreen dye solutions were prepared according to the 

instructions of the manufacturer using reagents provided in the kit and added at 150 ?l/well. 

All these procedures were performed in triplicate. After 10 minutes of incubation in a dark 

room, the fluorescence at 545 nm was read on a plate reader (FLx800, Bio-Tek Instruments 

Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) to determine DNA concentrations per scaffold. A conversion factor 

of 2.7 pg DNA/cell was used to calculate cell number based on MSC standards. 

 

2.4. Alkaline phosphatase activity 

Alkaline phosphatase activity assays were performed on cell lysates using an 

established protocol.18  All samples were prepared in triplicate and compared against p-

nitrophenol standards. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 ?l of 0.3 N NaOH. 

Absorbance was read at 405 nm on a plate reader (PowerWave x340; Bio-Tek Inc., 

Winooski, VT, USA) to determine the alkaline phosphatase activity per scaffold.

109 

2.5. Calcium deposition measurement 

Calcium content in the SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds was measured by using a Calcium 

Kit (Diagnostic Chemical Limited, Oxford, CT, USA). After the ALP and DNA assays, a 

volume of 1 N acetic acid equal to the volume remaining in each well was added to each 

sample (final concentration of 0.5 N), and the plate was placed on an orbital shaker 

overnight. A volume of 300 ?l of calcium assay reagent was added to 20 ?l of sample 

solution in triplicate in 96-well plates. To generate a standard curve, serial dilutions of CaCl2 

were prepared (0-50 ?g/ml). Absorbance was read at 650 nm using a spectrophotometric 

plate reader (FLx800, Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). The calcium deposition 

in each scaffold is reported as ?g Ca2+. 

 

2.6. Histological and microscopic analysis 

After each time period, SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds were removed from the cassettes, 

washed twice in PBS, and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 minutes. Then, the scaffolds 

were washed with PBS and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, dried by 

hexamethyldisilazane, mounted on aluminium stages, sputter coated with gold, and 

examined with an FEI Quanta 400 Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (Hillsboro, 

OR, USA). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy were used to evaluate 

the morphological appearance and infiltration of the bone marrow stromal cells and 

deposited matrix. The samples for SEM observation were cut in half for analysis of both the 

top and bottom; additionally, cross-sections were cut. The samples were sputter-coated with 

gold, examined and photographed with an FEI Quanta 400 Environmental Scanning Electron 

Microscope (Hillsboro, OR, USA). 

The remaining cultured samples were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 10% formalin solution 

and embedded in HistoPrep freezing medium (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). 

Frozen sections of ~10-15 ?m thickness were obtained using a cryostat (HM500, Microm, 

Walldorf, Germany) operating at -23 ºC and mounted onto Superfrost Plus glass slides 

(Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), then stained with hematoxylin and eosin for 

histological evaluation. For visualization of mineralized tissue, additional sections were 

exposed to 5% silver nitrate solution under UV for 25 min and counterstained with 0.5% 

safranin O solution. von Kossa stained sections were observed using a light microscope 

(Eclipse E600; Nikon, Melville, NY, USA) and attached video camera (3CCD Color Video 

Camera DXC-950P; Sony, Park Ridge, NJ, USA). Mineral deposition was also visualized in

Stromal Cells Cultured upon Starch/Poly(?-Caprolactone) Fiber Meshes 

110 

unstained sections under fluorescent light after adding tetracycline-HCl to the culture media 

at a final concentration of 10 ?g/mL.2,14 All the histological sections, except von Kossa 

stained sections, were visualized using an Olympus BX61 Motorized System Microscope and 

attached video camera Olympus DP70 equipped with a fluorescence lamp. 

 

2.7. Statistics 

Results of DNA, ALP, and calcium assay are expressed as mean ? standard 

deviation with n = 3 for each group. Single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to 

determine statistical significance within a data set. If ANOVA detected a significant difference 

within the data set, Tukey’s honestly significantly different (HSD) multiple comparison test 

was used to determine significant differences between groups and conditions. All tests were 

conducted with a confidence interval of 95% (p &amp;lt;0.05). 

 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1. DNA assay 

A significant improvement in cell number was generally observed in flow perfusion 

conditions when compared with static cultures (Figure 1). SEM images and H&amp;amp;E stained 

sections also confirm these results (Figures 2, 3 and 4). The SPCL/cell constructs cultured 

without enzymes or with ?-amylase in flow perfusion conditions reached their peak 

cellularities at day 8, and after that point they demonstrated a significant decrease in the 

number of cells measured in each scaffold (Figure 1), in agreement with previous 

experiments.2,3 In contrast, the DNA results showed an increase in cell numbers after 16 

days for SPCL scaffolds cultured with lipase or with both enzymes. Scaffolds cultured in the 

presence of lipase or with both enzymes, under flow conditions after 16 days, had almost 3 

and 2 times higher cellularity, respectively, when compared with SPCL/cell constructs 

cultured for 16 days under flow conditions without enzymes.

as means ? standard deviation with n=3 for each bar. (*) Indicates a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) 

between 8 and 16 days; (**) indicates a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) between groups (with and 

without enzymes) in static or flow conditions; and (#) indicates a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) 

between flow and static conditions. 

 

3.2. Microscopic analysis 

Cross-sections of all groups were visualized using SEM to evaluate cell morphology 

and infiltration and deposition of extracellular matrix. Culturing the constructs in a flow 

perfusion bioreactor enhanced the infiltration of MSCs for all groups (Figure 3). Previous 

studies have also demonstrated that flow perfusion culture increased the distribution and 

infiltration of cells as compared with static culture.2,19-21 This was further confirmed by 

histological evaluation of the scaffolds (Figure 4).  The cellular distribution observed in static 

as well as flow conditions was not influenced by the presence of the enzymes. Cross-

sectional images of all groups cultured under flow perfusion conditions revealed infiltration of 

cells through the bottom of the scaffolds and the presence of matrix between fibers deeper 

within the scaffolds (Figure 3) as compared to constructs that were cultured statically (Figure 

2). Furthermore, SEM images indicated that the enzymes did not have a deleterious effect on 

the structure of SPCL fiber meshes, meaning that the constructs did not loose their structural 

integrity after 16 days, even when flow perfusion conditions and enzymes were used (Figure 

3). This was further confirmed with histological cross sections, which additionally showed that 

there were no observable differences between scaffolds cultured in flow conditions with 

respect to the distribution and infiltration of cells (Figure 4).

Sections have been stained with hematoxylin and eosin and shown at 4x magnification. The scale bar 

corresponds to 500 ?m and applies to all images. 

 

3.3. Alkaline phosphatase activity 

ALP is considered to be an early stage marker of osteogenic differentiation.12 

Typically a rise and fall of ALP activity is characteristic of osteoblastic differentiation.2,3 

However, ALP can be expressed at high levels near the end of the proliferative period and 

during the period of extracellular matrix deposition and maturation.12 Such a trend is 

observed in Figure 5, where all groups cultured under flow conditions, with the exception of 

SPCL/cell constructs supplemented with both enzymes, had a significant increase of ALP 

activity at day 16. The highest peak of ALP activity was observed for SPCL/cell constructs 

cultured without enzymes in flow perfusion conditions. The ALP activity was normalized to 

reflect the ALP activity per cell. Results show significant differences between flow perfusion 

and static cultures for complete osteogenic media without enzymes, with ?-amylase and with 

lipase. Flow significantly enhanced the ALP activity for all groups, with the exception of 

SPCL/cell constructs cultured with ?-amylase and lipase. There was no apparent positive 

effect of adding enzymes to culture media on ALP activity implying that the influence of 

enzymes predominantly affected the later osteoblastic differentiation, as characterized by

mineralization (Figure 5), more than the early osteoblastic differentiation, as characterized by 

ALP activity.

3.4. Calcium deposition measurement 

The calcium content in scaffolds is an indication of the production of mineralized 

matrix and a marker of the late-stage osteoblastic differentiation of cells.11,14  Even in static 

cultures, there was a significant increase in the mineralization of SPCL/cell constructs in the 

presence of either enzyme between day 8 and 16. It has been previously reported that lipase 

enhanced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs under static conditions.8 A similar increase in 

calcium deposition under static conditions with ?-amylase was observed in the present study 

as well, although a combination of the enzymes failed to produce a similar increase in 

calcium deposition. The calcium data were corroborated by SEM images where it is possible 

to see the cross-sections of the constructs and the enhanced distribution of MSCs and ECM 

throughout the constructs when flow perfusion bioreactors were used (Figure 3). In flow 

perfusion conditions, the mineralized matrix content of all groups (with or without enzyme 

supplementation) cultured for 16 days was greatly increased over those cultured in static 

conditions (Figure 6). SPCL/cell constructs cultured with lipase under flow perfusion 

conditions showed increased calcium content (1271 ± 32 ?g/scaffold) when compared with

SPCL cultured without enzymes (907 ±124 ?g/scaffold). In addition, SPCL/cell constructs 

cultured in flow perfusion bioreactors with both enzymes (?-amylase and lipase) showed 

significantly greater calcium deposition at 8 days when compared with other groups.  The 

calcium data were further corroborated by SEM images, where cross-sections of the 

constructs showed deeper and more extensive distribution of mineralized ECM throughout 

the constructs when flow perfusion bioreactors were used (Figure 3). 

One of the objectives of this study was to examine the efficacy of the enzymes in 

inducing osteogenic differentiation. The literature indicates that besides being responsible for 

poly(?-caprolactone) degradation, lipase plays an important role in osteoblastic differentiation 

of rat bone marrow stromal cells when added to culture media.8 Under flow perfusion 

conditions and in the presence of lipase, SPCL/cell constructs cultured for 16 days in the 

present study showed the highest amount of calcium (1271 ± 32 ?g/scaffold). However, the 

calcium content of SPCL/cell constructs cultured under flow perfusion condition with culture 

medium supplemented with both enzymes (?-amylase and lipase) was 737 ± 25 ?g/scaffold, 

only slightly higher than that obtained with culture medium supplemented with ?-amylase. 

This indicates that the presence of ?-amylase does not enhance the deposition of calcium 

and therefore the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Furthermore, ?-amylase does not 

appear to improve the cellularity of MSCs on the SPCL constructs. Considering these results, 

it can be hypothesized that the lower calcium amount could be related to the lower cell 

number obtained with cellular scaffold constructs treated with ?-amylase. The decrease in 

cell number observed with ?-amylase could be attributed to the loss of surface area of SPCL 

fiber scaffolds, due to the dissolution of starch present within the scaffold in the presence of 

?-amylase. It has been previously shown that SPCL scaffolds, which are a blend of 30% 

starch and 70% PCL, undergo significant weight loss in the presence of ?-amylase.8 A 

weight loss of approximately 25% was observed between day 7 and 14 in ?-amylase, which 

was significantly greater than the weight loss observed in the presence of lipase alone. This 

study indicated that the weight loss in the presence of ?-amylase was mainly due to the 

partial degradation and release of starch present in the SPCL scaffolds. Moreover, when 

SPCL/cell constructs were cultured under flow and in the presence of ?-amylase, the number 

of cells was lower when compared with the other groups. For this condition, the calcium data 

reflected a lower degree of mineralization. One possible explanation could be related to the 

degradation of starch by ?-amylase after 16 days of culture under flow conditions. Previous 

degradation studies with ?-amylase showed a pronounced weight loss of approximately 25% 

after 3 days which increased slightly to 30% after 30 days.8 Since SPCL is a blend of 30% 

starch and 70% poly(?-caprolactone), this weight loss might be related with the degradation 

of starch.  Based on this hypothesis, ?-amylase does not have a negative effect on

116 

osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, but the differences observed in the data might be related 

to the degradation of the starch component of the fibers.

amylase, with lipase, or with ?-amylase and lipase in static and flow conditions for 8 and 16 days

n=3 for each bar. (*) Indicates a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) between 8 and 16 days; (**) indicates a

3.5. von Kossa staining and tetracycline fluorescence 

Mineral deposition is considered to be a marker of full maturation of the osteoblast 

phenotype in differentiating bone marrow stromal cells. The von Kossa stained sections of all 

groups cultured for 16 days demonstrated that flow perfusion had a positive effect in the 

deposition of extracellular matrix, in agreement with the previous results.2 

Tetracycline is a fluorochrome-labeling agent for bone tissues.22 Tetracycline 

accumulates at bone forming sites and fluoresces brightly when activated with fluorescent 

light.  Figure 8 indicates numerous regions in the interior of the scaffolds from all groups 

cultured under flow conditions where mineral deposition has occurred after 16 days in 

culture. In contrast, minimal tetracycline fluorescence appeared in scaffolds cultured under 

static conditions (data not shown). Furthermore, tetracycline fluorescence shows that mineral 

was more evenly distributed within the scaffold when the constructs were cultured in flow 

conditions, whereas constructs cultured statically had fluorescence limited to the outer edges 

of the scaffold. As noted previously, Figure 8A and Figure 8C show an enhanced distribution

117 

and greater amount of mineral deposition throughout the SPCL/cell constructs cultured 

without enzymes or with lipase, when compared with SPCL/cell constructs cultured with ?-

amylase or both enzymes together.  

 

Figure 7. von Kossa stained histological sections of SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds cultured in vitro 

without enzymes, with ?-amylase, with lipase, or with ?-amylase and lipase for 16 days at different 

magnifications under flow perfusion conditions. 

 

SEM imaging, von Kossa staining, and tetracycline images showed that the mesh 

pores of the flow perfusion samples were almost completely filled with matrix after 16 days 

when SPCL/cell constructs were cultured with osteogenic medium supplemented with lipase. 

These results were also corroborated by the calcium data, presented above, where the 

greatest content of calcium was measured when lipase was present. Osteogenic culture 

medium supplemented with lipase did not only stimulate enhancement of mineralized matrix 

deposition (Figure 6) but also generated mineralized extracellular matrix that was distributed 

throughout the porosity of the scaffolds (Figures 7C and 8C). Lipase is a molecule previously 

shown to be capable of directing osteoblastic differentiation of rat MSCs cultured statically.8 

This work corroborates these previous findings and further shows that lipase promotes the 

osteoblastic differentiation of rat MSCs, especially when coupled with flow perfusion culture.

4x APO objective.  The scale bar is 500 ?m and applies to all images. 

 

4. CONCLUSIONS 

This work demonstrates that osteogenic media supplemented with ?-amylase, or with ?-

amylase and lipase together, and cultured in flow perfusion bioreactors did not enhance 

osteoblastic differentiation of rat marrow stromal cells compared with SPCL/cell constructs 

without enzymes. However, it was observed that SPCL fiber mesh scaffold/MSC constructs 

cultured with osteogenic medium supplemented with lipase under flow perfusion were more 

mineralized than the other groups examined, which indicates late-stage osteoblastic 

differentiation of MSCs. This study demonstrates that lipase and flow perfusion conditions act 

as effective osteogenic stimuli in the differentiation of rat marrow stromal cells, also 

promoting the production of mineralized extracellular matrix. This strategy of using scaffolds 

that are enzymatically degraded by enzymes naturally present in the human blood serum, 

together with demonstrated improvement of osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs by lipase 

under flow perfusion conditions shows promising results for bone tissue engineering 

applications.

Natural Origin Scaffolds with In Situ Pore Forming Capability for Bone Tissue 

Engineering Applications1 

 

ABSTRACT 

This work describes the development of a biodegradable matrix, based on chitosan and 

starch, with the ability of forming a porous structure in situ due to the attack by specific 

enzymes present in the human body (?-amylase and lysozyme). Scaffolds with three 

different compositions were developed: chitosan (C100) and chitosan/starch (CS80-20, 

CS60-40). Compressive tests results showed that these materials exhibit very promising 

mechanical properties, namely a high modulus in dry and wet state. The compressive 

modulus in dry state for C100 was 580±33 MPa, CS80-20 (402±62 MPa) and CS60-40 

(337±78 MPa). Degradation studies were performed using ?-amylase and/or lysozyme at 

concentrations similar to those found in human serum, at 37 ºC up to 90 days. SEM 

micrographs showed that after enzymatic degradation there was the formation of a porous 

structure, indicating the potential of this methodology to obtain in situ forming scaffolds. In 

order to evaluate the biocompatibility of the scaffolds, extracts and direct contact tests were 

performed. Results with MTT test showed that the extracts of the materials were clearly non-

toxic to L929 fibroblast cells. Analysis of cell adhesion and morphology of seeded 

osteoblastic-like cells in direct contact tests, at day 7, showed that the number of cells on 

CS80-20 and CS60-40 was noticeably higher than that on C100, which suggests that starch 

containing materials may promote cell adhesion and proliferation. This combination of 

properties seems to be a very promising approach to obtain scaffolds with gradual in vivo 

pore forming capability for bone tissue engineering applications.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Tissue engineering has recently emerged as a new interdisciplinary science to repair 

injured body parts and restore their functions by using laboratory-grown tissues, materials 

and artificial implants. An ideal scaffold to be used for bone tissue engineering should 

possesses characteristics of excellent biocompatibility, adequate pore size, controllable 

biodegradability and suitable mechanical properties 1-3. The choice of the appropriate 

fabrication technique is critical because it can significantly influence the properties of the 

implant and its degradation characteristics. There is, therefore, an increasing need to look for 

new materials and methodologies to produce scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. One 

interesting possibility is to develop an in vivo responsive scaffold which properties may be 

regulated by the bone regeneration process, with gradual formation of pores in situ and 

consequent resorption. This hypothesis seems to be very promising due the control of 

degradation in situ and consequent pore formation, which allows to have scaffold with the 

required mechanical properties in the initial stage of implantation.  

One of the present trends in implantable applications requires materials that are 

derived from nature. Natural origin materials have been demonstrated to promote healing at 

a faster rate and are expected to exhibit greater compatibility with human tissues. The 

combination of chitosan with other materials appears to be a common theme in a various 

reports 4,5. Chitosan is a linear copolymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-glucosamine and 

it is a deacetylated derivative of chitin. The degree of deacetylation (DD) represents the 

proportion of D-glucosamine units with respect to the total number of units. DD is a structural 

parameter which influences physicochemical properties 6 such as solubility, crystallinity, 

swelling behavior and  biological properties 6, namely the biodegradation by lysozyme 7,8, the 

wound healing properties 9 and the osteogenesis enhancement 10. One of the interesting 

features of chitosan is its cationic nature, resulting from primary amine groups, thus forming 

water-insoluble ionic complexes with a variety of a polyanionic substances. It is normally 

insoluble in aqueous solution above pH 7. However, in diluted acids (pH &amp;lt;6), the free amino 

groups are protonated and polymer becomes soluble. Chitosan has been applied to induce 

the extracellular matrix formation in tissue regenerative therapy 11. The degradation of 

chitosan in the human body has been reported to be carried out by lysozyme 7,8. The 

degradation kinetics appears to be inversely related to degree of deacetylation 8,12. 

Lysozyme, or muramidase, is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the peptidoglycan 

layer of bacterial cell walls. Human lysozyme is found in various body fluids in concentrations 

from 7 to 13 mg/l13-15  in serum and from 450 to 1230 mg/l in tears13,14, saliva13,14 and other 

fluids including those surrounding cartilage 16. Following implantation of a biomaterial, 

neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages will be present around the foreign material

in both the acute and chronic phases of inflammation. A number of enzymes, such as 

lysozyme, and reactive species will be released from these cells. 

Biodegradable starch-based polymeric biomaterials have been studied and proposed 

for a wide range of biomedical applications. Starch is one of the most abundant naturally 

occurring polymers, presenting a combination of properties that is steadily increasing its uses 

on several technologies. Starch is a natural polymer that presents excellent characteristics to 

be applied in the biomaterials field, which are mainly low toxicity17,18, biodegradability19, 

biocompability20,21. It is inexpensive and above all reusable. The main enzymes involved in 

starch degradation are ?-, ?-, amylase, glucosidase and other debranching enzymes. Starch 

is hydrolysed to glucose, maltose and dextrin. It is well known that salivary amylase is 

involved in the gastric and intestinal digestion of starch in food components. Amylase can 

also be found in human serum. 

The aim of this work was to develop a biodegradable matrix, based in chitosan and 

native starch, that will form a porous structure in vivo by the preferential attack of the matrix 

by specific enzymes present in the human body (namely the ?-amylase and lysozyme). The 

inclusion of an enzymatically degradable phase in biomaterials may constitute an interesting 

approach to obtain scaffolds with adequate mechanical properties and with a gradual in situ 

pore forming ability. Using this innovative methodology, the developed scaffolds can exhibit 

very promising mechanical properties, due the inexistence of macroporosity, at the initial 

stage of implantation. The porosity will be formed in situ by enzymes present in human body.  

In this work, chitosan/starch scaffolds were developed by using a precipitation 

method. These systems were analyzed in terms of morphology, degradation behavior and 

mechanical properties. This study also addressed the effect of leachables from developed 

scaffolds on the viability of mouse fibroblasts and the influence of the constructs surface on 

the morphology, adhesion and spreading of fibroblast and human osteoblasts. 

 

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  

2.1. Materials 

Chitosan with DD of 92% (determinated by the titration method as described in 22) and 

native corn starch were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, USA). Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) 

and sodium sulphate (Na2SO4) were supplied from Panreac (Barcelona, Spain) ?-amylase 

from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens was obtained by Genencor International, Inc. (Rochester, 



CHAPTER V. Natural Origin Scaffolds with In Situ Pore Forming Capability for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications 

128 

NY, USA); egg white lysozyme and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from 

Sigma (St. Louis, USA). 

 

2.2. Scaffolds preparation 

Chitosan was dissolved in acetic acid 1% (v/v) to obtain a 5% (w/v) solution (C100). 

Then, using the same procedure other formulations were prepared with the following ratios: 

80/20 chitosan/starch scaffolds (CS80-20) and 60/40 chitosan/starch scaffolds (CS60-40). 

The solutions were casted into moulds and frozen (-18ºC) overnight. They were then 

immersed in a precipitation solution (25% NaOH 1M and 75% Na2SO4 0.5M) overnight, 

adapted from Tuzlakoglu et al.23. After precipitation, the samples were washed repeatedly 

with distilled water to remove excess of salts, dried at 37ºC and followed by successive 

washings for 5 days until no pH changes were detected.  

 

2.3. Degradation studies 

Degradation studies were carried out by incubating the scaffolds in phosphate 

buffered saline (PBS) solution (pH 7.4) containing ?-amylase (150 U/L15,24) and/or lysozyme 

13 mg/L13-15), at concentrations similar to the ones found in human serum, at 37ºC up to 90 

days. A control was also performed by incubating the samples in buffer alone. At the end of 

the degradation period, the samples were removed and immediately weighed for 

determination of water uptake, washed thoroughly with distilled water and dried for later 

calculation of weight loss. Degradation solutions were also analyzed to measure the

?-amylase, using the dinitrosalicylic acid method. 

 

2.4. Analysis of sample morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 

The cross-sections morphology, before and after degradation, was observed by 

scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in a Leica Cambridge S360. All samples were 

previously coated with a gold layer (Fisons Instruments, Sputter Coater SC502, UK).

2.5. Mechanical properties – compression tests 

The mechanical properties of the materials were evaluated on compression tests 

carried out in the dry and wet state in an Instron 4505 universal mechanical testing machine 

at a controlled environment (23ºC and 55% RH). The cross-head speed was 2 mm/min until 

1% strain. 

 

2.6. Cell lines used for biocompatibility testing  

For biocompatibility assessment of the different formulations of the developed 

scaffolds two different cell types were used: L929 (ECACC, European Collection of Cell 

Cultures), a mouse fibroblast cell line and SaOs-2 (ATCC, American Type Culture 

Collection), a cell line derived from human osteosarcoma. L929 is a cell line commonly used 

in cytotoxicity testing and osteoblast-like SaOs-2 cells were chosen because they are a 

model of a relevant cell type for the medical application of the implant. Both cell lines were 

cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Sigma, St Louis, USA), 

supplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Biochrome) and 1% 

antibiotic/antimicotic solution (Sigma, St. Louis, USA).  In all the experiments cells were kept 

in an incubator at constant temperature (37ºC) and CO2 concentration (5%). 

 

2.7. Biocompatibility evaluation: extracts and cell adhesion studies   

In the scope of biocompatibility assessment, and according to ISO norms, two 

categories of in vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed: extract and direct contact tests. The 

scaffolds, previously sterilized by ethylene oxide, were extracted in complete culture medium 

for 24h at constant temperature (37ºC) and agitation (60 rpm). L929 cells were seeded in 96 

wells cell culture plates (10 000 cells/cm2), in order to reach 80% confluence in 24h. The 

extracts were filtered and placed in contact with the monolayer of L929 cells for 72hrs. A 

control, with cells grown in the presence of complete culture medium, was included. 

Afterwards, the viability test MTT was performed. Briefly, the culture medium was replaced 

by a solution of MTT and the cells were incubated for 4 hrs. The viable cells, those with 

functional mitochondrial dehydrogenase, were able to reduce the yellow MTT into a purple 

formazan product. The end product was quantified by spectroscopy and the results 

expressed as percentage of cell viability. 

In direct contact test, the developed scaffolds were seeded with L929 cells (8x 104/50 

µL) and with osteoblast-like cells (5x105 cells/mL), for 3 and 7 days. Prior to cell seeding, the

130 

chitosan/starch scaffolds were immersed in culture medium overnight. This step intends to 

reduce culture medium uptake by the highly hydrophilic materials. After each time point, the 

samples were fixed with glutaraldehyde, dehydrated, critical point dried and gold sputtered 

for SEM observation. 

 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1. Characterization of the scaffolds morphology 

In this work, degradable scaffolds based on chitosan and native corn starch were 

developed aimed to be used in bone tissue engineering applications. Three different 

compositions were prepared and tested. Figure 1 shows the interior morphology of the 

obtained scaffolds. C100 material exhibits a smooth surface (Figure 1A), whereas in the 

micrographs of CS80-20 and CS60-40 scaffolds (Figure 1B and 1C) it is possible to observe 

that the starch granules are homogenously distributed along the chitosan matrix, as well its 

incorporation in the chitosan matrix. Starch granules have dimensions from 0.5 to 175 µm 25 

that is main dependent from its origin. SEM micrographs (Figure 1B and 1C) shows that 

starch granules from native corn starch have dimensions from 5-10 µm. The proposed 

processing technique is based in a precipitation solution. This technique was used with the 

aim of promoting the ionic complexation. This precipitation method does not allow to obtain a 

macroporous structure (Figure 1). The macroporosity will be formed in situ by human 

enzymes present in human serum.

C100 (A), CS80-20 (B) and CS60-40 (C). The scale bar is 50 µm and applies to all images. 

 

3.2. Degradation behavior  

The main aim of these degradation studies, using ?-amylase and lysozyme with 

similar concentrations to the ones found in human serum, is to simulate the physiological 



CHAPTER V. Natural Origin Scaffolds with In Situ Pore Forming Capability for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications 

131 

conditions and subsequent pore formation. It is expected that this innovative methodology 

will induce the formation of pores. The pore size and its distribution in the scaffold can be 

controlled by the location of the ‘sacrifice’ phase (native starch) that will also control the 

water uptake behavior due to the different hydrophilic nature of the materials. The hypothesis 

of this work is related with the formation of pores due to the degradation induced by specific 

enzymes ubiquitous in the human body. After implantation it is expect that a porous structure 

will formed in situ allowing the penetration of the cells deep into these scaffolds. 

Concerning the water uptake in PBS, the C100 scaffolds present the highest 

hydration degree, of about 140% (Figure 2). The ability of a material to keep water and its 

water permeability are important parameters to be studied, since it will influence the 

absorption of body fluids and the transfer of cell nutrients and metabolites through the 

materials. The diffusity of nutrients is a very important parameter since in an in vivo situation, 

a porous structure will be formed, induced by enzymes present in human body allowing the 

penetration of cells deep into the scaffolds. As expected, the water uptake of CS80-20 and 

CS60-40 is lower than C100, which is due to the presence of starch that is less hydrophilic 

than chitosan (Figure 2). The weight loss in PBS was not significant (data not shown). The 

highest weight loss was observed in CS60-40. This fact can be explained by the presence of 

starch granules that are physically distributed. These results suggest that different 

percentages of starch influence the degradation rate.

  All scaffolds were sectioned to observe the interior morphology and formation of 

pores induced by enzymes at similar concentrations to those found in human serum. By SEM 

observation it was detected, as expected, the attack of the native starch phase (CS80-20 and 

CS60-40) (Figures 3C and 3D) in the presence of ?-amylase. It was also observed that ?-

amylase induced the formation of pores in C100 material (Figures 3A and 3B). It was also 

reported by Muzzarelli et al. 26 that ?-amylase was able to attack the chitosan material.  

In the presence of lysozyme, it was possible to detect the preferential attack of C100 

(Figure 3E) since this enzyme is able to hydrolyse chitosan in some extend. It is expected 

that, when the scaffolds will be implanted in the body, the chitosan would be degraded 

gradually by lysozyme and then reabsorbed.  Lysozyme is known to be ubiquitous in the 

body13,27. The main advantage of biodegradable over non-biodegradable materials is the 

disappearance of implanted foreign materials which might elicit foreign body reactions from 

the host’s defence system during their long term contact with a living structure. Since 

lysozyme is present in cellular lysosomes and lysosomal rupture is associated with 

inflammation, it has been assumed that the source of the increased lysozyme activity is the 

release of enzyme from the lysossomes of phagocytic cells28. When any material is 

implanted an acute inflammatory response will occur, and it is known in this situation the pH 

values will decrease and high levels of lysozyme are secreted to the surround medium. 

Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the initial degradation rate of chitosan at pH 4.5 

is about five times higher than the rate at pH 7.014.  The results obtained in this work showed 

the attack of C100 by lysozyme and the consequent pore formation.

Figure 3. SEM micrographs showing the morphology of chitosan-based scaffolds after 14 days in PBS 

with ?-amylase solution (A-C100, C- CS80-20, D- CS60-40); after 30 days in same solution (B- C100); 

after 14 days in PBS with lysozyme solution (E- C100, F- CS80-20) and in the same period in PBS 

with ?-amylase and lysozyme solution (G-C100, H-CS60-40). 

 

 In order to investigate the effect of an enzyme cocktail, containing ?-amylase and 

lysozyme together, on the overall degradation rate of the materials, as well as on the type of 

porosity obtained, the materials were also simultaneously incubated with these enzymes. 

Analysing the results presented in Figure 4 it is possible to observe that CS60-40 showed the 

highest weight loss, when compared with CS80-20 and C100. The higher susceptibility of 

CS60-40 to enzymatic degradation may be related with the presence of a higher surface 

area for preferential attack, due to the interface between the two components. SEM 

micrographs (Figures 3G and 3H) show that after enzymatic degradation there is the 

formation of a porous structure. Some studies showed that pore sizes less than 15-50 µm 

result in fibrovascular ingrowth, pore sizes of 50-150 µm encourage osteoid formation, and 

pore sizes greater than 150 µm encourage the ingrowth of mineralized bone29. 



CHAPTER V. Natural Origin Scaffolds with In Situ Pore Forming Capability for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications 

134 

Since the formation of pores in the presence of lysozyme was not so pronounced 

compared to those obtained with ?-amylase or the two enzymes together (?-amylase and 

lysozyme) these studies must be improved. One possible alternative could be the 

incorporation of lysozyme in higher concentrations at the surface of these materials. It might 

be adequate to enhance the in vivo performance using a CaP coating since these materials 

itself are not osteoconductive/osteoconductive. Several papers report the incorporation of 

enzymes or bioactive agents into CaP coatings in order to promote their degradation and/or 

their osteoconductive/osteoinductive potential30-32. It is expected also that in an in vivo 

situation the pore formation will occur more rapidly, due the inflammatory response that 

decreases the pH and also because high levels of lysozyme will be released by several cells 

such as neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages.

After enzymatic degradation it was observed the formation of a porous structure, 

indicating the potential of this methodology to obtain “smart” in vivo forming scaffolds for 

bone tissue engineering applications. 

The in vitro pore formation in the presence of enzymes at the similar concentration to 

those found in human plasma is clear. It is expected that in an in vivo situation the pore 

formation will occur more rapidly, due to the presence of other enzymes and cells.

3.3. Mechanical properties 

A hard material, with a high initial mechanical strength and an adequate degradation 

rate, is normally required for bone tissue engineering applications. The results of the 

compressive tests showed that these materials exhibit very interesting mechanical properties 

in the dry and even in the wet state. The highest compressive modulus was observed for 

C100 (580±33 MPa) in the dry state. For CS80-20 and CS60-40, the compressive moduli in 

the dry state were 402±62 MPa and 337±78 MPa, respectively (Figure 5). The values found 

are higher than the typical values presented for chitosan-based materials. The modulus 

decreased with increasing amounts of starch present in the scaffolds. This can be due to the 

poor adhesion between the phases, since it is a physical mixture, i.e., the ‘sacrifice’ phase is 

acting as nucleation site for fracture propagation. In the wet state, it was observed the same 

tendency, but the values were lower, as it was expected (C100: 107±15 MPa, CS80-20: 

53±3 MPa and CS60-40: 31±1 MPa) (Figure 5). The mechanical properties exhibited by the 

scaffolds in the wet state fall in the normal ranges of strength and modulus for trabecular 

bone  which are about 0.02-0.5 GPa 1,3 for compressive modulus and 2-12 MPa 1,3 for 

strength.

3.4. Cytotoxic assessment of the extracts 

In order to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the substances that leach out of the developed 

scaffolds the viability assay (MTT test) was performed. This test is based on mitochondria 

viability, where only functional mitochondria can oxidize an MTT solution, giving a typical 

blue-violet end product.  Figure 6 shows that for CS80-20 and CS60-40 the percentage of 



CHAPTER V. Natural Origin Scaffolds with In Situ Pore Forming Capability for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications 

136 

viable cells was around 100%, thus comparable to the control. On the other hand, the value 

of viable L929 cells in contact with C100 leachables was lower (75%). MTT assay suggested 

that the extracts from the developed scaffolds, produced by precipitation method, were non-

toxic towards mouse fibroblasts.

3.5. Cell morphology evaluation 

The absence of cytotoxicity, however, does not confer knowledge about the 

biocompatibility of a biomaterial33. In order to verify if the developed scaffolds support the 

functions shared by many cell types such as membrane integrity, adhesion to surfaces and 

replication, adhesion studies with the cell line L929 were performed. At the end of 7 days, 

regardless of the scaffold formulation, all constructs were covered with a monolayer of cells 

(Figure 7). The fibroblasts had a typical spindle-shape morphology and exhibited 

cytoplasmatic projections strongly attached to the scaffolds. Only in CS80-20 there were 

some rounded cells denoting that they were in an earlier adhesion step (Figure 7B). L929 

cells were able to adhere, spread filopodia and stretch over the surface of the developed 

scaffolds. The slight toxicity of C100 extracts detected in MTT assay did not have any 

negative effect on the ability of L929 cells to adhere and spread on the surface of the 

construct.

and CS60-40 (C and F), before cell culture (A-C) and after 7 days of culture with L929 cells (D-F). 

 

Cellular attachment and migration of osteoblast cells over the bone substituting 

material surface are essential to obtain effective wound filling and bone tissue adaptation34. 

For that, osteoblast-like cells were seeded on C100, CS80-20 and CS60-40 and the 

adhesion profile, as well as cell morphology was documented by SEM. On day 3 of culture, 

SEM examination revealed osteoblasts aggregates sparsely distributed over the surface of 

C100 (Figure 8A). At the same time point, the amount of cells attached to the surface of 

CS80-20 was higher, although cells did not cover the entire surface of the scaffold (Figure 

8B). Figure 8C shows the surface of CS60-40 covered by a compact monolayer of 

osteoblasts just after 3 days of culture. At this time point is quite notorious the differences 

between the chitosan scaffold (C100) and the chitosan/starch scaffolds (CS80-20 and CS60-

40). The same trend was observed at the end of 7 days. On the C100 scaffold the growth 

was limited to some restricted areas and probably these areas were the result of the 

expansion of the cellular aggregates seen after 3 days (Figure 8D). On the other hand, in 

chitosan-starch scaffolds (CS80-20 and CS60-40) the surface was homogenously covered 

by a multilayer of osteoblast-like cells (Figures 8E and 8F). 

Cell adhesion and spreading are influenced by the physicochemical characteristics of 

the underlaying solid surface35. CS80-20 and CS60-40 supported in the same extent the 

adhesion of fibroblasts and osteoblasts. However, SaOs-2 behaved in a different way on the 

surface of C100 scaffold. The poorer spreading on C100 maybe related with the higher 

chitosan content that renders the surface more hydrophilic. This impairs the adsorption of 

serum proteins and consequently cell adhesion35. Another explanation to the difference 

between the starch blended scaffolds and chitosan scaffold could be the topography. A 

higher level of roughness appears capable of enhancing osteoblast adhesion and 

subsequent proliferation and differentiation36. The starch granules present in CS80-20 and 

CS60-40 increase the roughness of the surface and therefore improve cell growth and 

attachment (Figures 8E and 8F).

4. CONCLUSIONS 

Scaffolds based on chitosan and starch were developed and characterised to be used 

in bone tissue engineering applications. The results of the compressive tests showed that 

these materials exhibit very promising mechanical properties in dry and wet state. After 

enzymatic degradation there was the formation of a porous structure, indicating the potential 

of this methodology to obtain “smart” in situ forming scaffolds. These “smart” scaffolds, with 

in situ pore forming capability and interesting mechanical properties, seem to be 

advantageous when compared with other conventional materials. Regarding the 

biocompatibility studies, the extracts of the developed scaffolds were not toxic and 

concerning the osteoblast attachment, CS80-20 and CS60-40 showed to be a better 

substratum than C100. These results indicate that the incorporation of starch has a 

favourable affect in the interaction with osteoblasts.    



CHAPTER V. Natural Origin Scaffolds with In Situ Pore Forming Capability for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications

This combination of properties seems to be a very promising approach to obtain 

scaffolds with gradual in situ pore formation ability for bone tissue engineering applications.

Chitosan Scaffolds Incorporating Lysozyme into CaP Coatings Produced by a 

Biomimetic Route: A Novel Concept for Tissue Engineering Combining a Self-

Regulated Degradation System with In Situ Pore Formation1 

 

ABSTRACT 

This study describes an innovative self-regulated degrading material with gradual in situ pore 

formation ability for bone tissue engineering applications. This approach is based on the 

incorporation of the lysozyme enzyme into calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings, prepared on 

the surface of chitosan scaffolds by means of a biomimetic coating technique with the aim of 

controlling their degradation rate and subsequent formation of pores. However, because 

lysozyme has antibacterial properties, these coatings may act as a carrier for its sustained 

release, preventing infection upon implantation. In order to prove the concept of in situ pore 

formation, the coated scaffolds (with and without lysozyme) were incubated in two different 

solutions at different pH to simulate normal physiological conditions (pH 7.4) and 

inflammatory response (pH 5). The weight loss and morphology of the scaffolds was 

monitored over time. At pH 7.4, the scaffolds remained more stable than at pH 5. The 

scaffolds incubated at pH 5 showed a rapid decrease in their initial weight and scanning 

electron microscopy imaging revealed the formation of a highly porous structure. 

Furthermore, evaluation of the activity of the incorporated lysozyme revealed that the 

enzyme was able to hydrolyse the peptidoglycan of the bacteria cell walls (as detected by the 

decrease in optical density with time), indicating that the enzyme remained active after being 

incorporated into the CaP coating.

1. INTRODUCTION 

A novel concept in tissue engineering which proposes in situ pore-forming scaffolds 

has been reported previously1. Chitosan has been considered a promising material for tissue 

engineering applications. It is a linear copolymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-

glucosamine, derived from chitin by a deacetylation reaction. The degree of deacetylation 

(DD) measures the percentage of glucosamine units in the polymer chain and influences its 

physicochemical properties such as solubility, crystallinity, and swelling behavior and 

biological properties2, namely osteogenesis enhancement3. The degradation kinetics appear 

to be inversely related to the DD4. It has been demonstrated that chitosan is degraded in vitro 

and in vivo by lysozyme4,5, an enzyme ubiquitous in the human body6,7. Lysozyme can attack 

cell wall polysaccharides of different bacterial species, especially Gram-positive bacteria, 

leading to rupture of the cell wall and killing of the micro-organism8,9. This study proposes the 

incorporation of the lysozyme enzyme into calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings, prepared on 

the surface of chitosan scaffolds by means of a biomimetic coating technique, with the aim of 

controlling their degradation rate and subsequent formation of pores. Furthermore, since 

lysozyme has antibacterial properties, these coatings may act as a carrier for its sustained 

release, preventing infection upon implantation. An improvement in the osteoconductivity of 

implants has been achieved by coating their surfaces with CaP layers10-12. The biomimetic 

methodology for coating biomaterials with a bone-like apatite layer has been described in 

several publications13-17. This technique mimics natural biomineralization processes, 

involving controlled crystal nucleation and growth control over the phase of the mineral 

deposited18. The main advantage of the biomimetic methodology is the use of physiological 

conditions (pH 7.4 at 37 ºC) simulating the manner in which apatite is formed in bone. 

Moreover, this technique allows the incorporation of proteins and bioactive agents into CaP 

coatings without compromising their activity19-22. An ideal material for the purpose of a 

temporary support for bone replacement should feature an adequate range of mechanical 

properties with convenient degradation kinetics, bone-bonding behavior and biocompatible 

performance23. 

In order to enhance the formation of pores in situ, chitosan scaffolds coated with CaP 

layers and lysozyme incorporated into the coatings were developed, presenting properties 

that promote degradation and osteoconductive potential. Lysozyme enzyme was 

incorporated into CaP coatings on the surface of chitosan scaffolds by means of a 

biomimetic route13,14,22. Moreover, CaP coatings enhance the osteoconductive properties of 

the chitosan scaffolds.

This study was designed to answer the following questions: Can a hydrolytic enzyme be 

incorporated at the surface of chitosan scaffolds without compromising its activity? Is it 

possible to develop a non-porous scaffold with in situ pore-forming ability? How many days 

does it takes to have a porous scaffold in situ fully interconnected simulating in vivo 

conditions? 

 

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

2.1. Materials 

Chitosan with a DD of 92% and medium molecular weight was obtained from Sigma 

(St. Louis, USA). Bioglass? 45S5 with the following composition: 45 SiO2, 24.5 CaO, 24.5 

Na2O and 6.0 P2O5 (in wt.%)  was supplied by NovaMin Technology Inc. (Alachua, FL). 

 

2.2. Preparation of chitosan scaffolds 

Chitosan scaffolds were prepared as previously described by Martins et al.1. Briefly, 

chitosan was dissolved in acetic acid 1% (v/v) to obtain a 5% (w/v) solution. Then, the 

solution was casted into polyethylene moulds and frozen (-18ºC) overnight. After that, they 

were  immersed in a precipitation solution (25% NaOH 1M and 75% Na2SO4 0.5M) overnight, 

adapted from the method developed by Tuzlakoglu et al.24. After precipitation, the samples 

were washed several times with distilled water and dried at 37 ºC. 

 

2.3. Preparation of CaP biomimetic coatings 

The method of preparing the CaP coatings was based on the methodology previously 

developed by Abe et al.13 and adapted by Reis et al.14,15 consisting in impregnation of the 

materials with bioactive glass called Bioglass? 45S5, followed by immersion in a simulated 

body fluid (SBF, 37 ºC, pH 7.4), presenting ionic concentrations similar to human blood 

plasma. Prior to the coating process, chitosan scaffolds were sterilized by ethylene oxide. 

Bioglass? 45S5 was sterilized by immersion in ethanol solution (70% v/v) and then dried 

inside the hood. All the subsequent work was performed under sterile conditions in a hood. 

Briefly, chitosan scaffolds were rolled in a wet bed of Bioglass? 45S5. After that, the scaffolds 

were immersed in a 1.0 SBF solution, without (control) and with lysozyme (1 g/L) from 

chicken egg white (Fluka, USA), for 7 days at 37 ºC, a period known as the nucleation stage, 



CHAPTER VI. Chitosan Scaffolds Incorporating Lysozyme into CaP Coatings Produced by a Biomimetic Route: A Novel 
Concept for Tissue Engineering Combining a Self-Regulated Degradation System with In Situ Pore Formation 

148 

which allows CaP nuclei formation. After the nucleation stage, all samples were washed with 

distilled water and immersed in a concentrated 1.5 SBF solution for 3, 7 and 14 days at 37ºC, 

in order to enhance CaP nuclei growth. All the solutions were sterilized by filtration prior to 

use. After each time period, chitosan scaffolds were washed with distilled water and dried 

until surface characterization was performed. The morphology of the CaP coatings obtained 

was analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Leica Cambridge S-360, UK). Prior to 

microstructure analysis, specimens were coated with gold using a Fisons Instruments Coater 

(Polaron SC 502, UK). In order to characterize the crystalline/amorphous nature of the films, 

thin-film X-ray diffraction (TF-XRD; Philips X’Pert MPD, The Netherlands) was used. Data 

collection was performed by 2? scan method with 1º as the incident beam angle using CuK? 

X-Ray line and a scan speed of 0.05º/min in 2?. In addition, infrared analysis (FTIR) of the 

coatings was performed in a Perkin-Elmer spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer 1600 series 

equipment, USA) to examine the chemical structure of the CaP biomimetic coatings 

obtained. Coatings were scraped from the chitosan scaffolds, mixed with KBr (Riedel-de 

Haën, Germany) and then formed into a disc in a press. All spectra were obtained between 

4400 and 450 cm-1 at a 2 cm-1 resolution.  

 

2.4. Degradation studies 

In order to simulate in vivo conditions, degradation studies were carried out by incubating 

uncoated chitosan scaffolds and CaP coated chitosan scaffolds, with and without 

incorporated lysozyme, in two different buffer solutions: (i) Tris-HCl buffer (0.22 mM, pH 7.4) 

to simulate the normal pH found in human body; and (ii) citrate buffer (1.0 mM, pH 5.0) to 

simulate the inflammatory response at 37 ºC for different periods of time. At the end of each 

degradation period, the samples were removed, washed with distilled water and dried for 

later calculation of weight loss (1). The morphology of the scaffolds after degradation was 

analysed by SEM.

149 

2.5. Determination of lysozyme activity in solution and released from the CaP coatings 

In order to evaluate the lysozyme activity and that released from the CaP coating at 

pH 5 and pH 7.4, the Micrococcus lysodeikticus assay was used. This assay is based on the 

ability of lysozyme to hydrolyse the cell wall fragments of bacteria. For determining the 

activity of released lysozyme, coated scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme were immersed in 

buffer solution (pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 ºC for 30 days. The released lysozyme (150 µL) 

was added to a 100 µL of Micrococcus lysodeikticus suspension (2.3 mg/mL, pH 7.4) in a 96-

well plate. The decrease in turbidity at 37 ºC was measured at 450 nm (Microplate Reader, 

SynergyTM HT, BIO-TEK Instruments, Inc., USA) at 1 min intervals during 30 minutes. The 

same procedure was used to determine the enzyme activity at pH 5 and pH 7.4. For that, 

known enzyme concentrations were prepared in buffers at pH 5 and pH 7.4 and added to the 

bacteria suspension in the same buffer. The initial kinetic rate (OD slope at t = 0) was 

measured for each sample, and a standard curve (lysozyme activity vs lysozyme 

concentration) was constructed. The lysozyme activity released after 30 days was 

determined from the standard curve. 

 

2.6. Statistics 

Results of weight loss are expressed as means ? standard deviation with n=3 for 

each group. The statistical significance of differences was determined using Student’s t-test 

multiple comparison procedure at a confidence interval of 95% (p &amp;lt;0.05).  

 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1. Development of CaP biomimetic coatings  

Figure 1 shows SEM images of the uncoated chitosan scaffold (Figure 1A) and CaP 

coated chitosan scaffolds after immersion in SBF solution in the presence (Figures 1C and 

1E) and absence (Figures 1B and 1D) of lysozyme. At the nucleation stage, it is possible to 

observe for both conditions (with and without lysozyme) the formation of apatite nuclei 

(Figures 1B and 1C). Lysozyme incorporation in the nucleation stage did not significantly 

affect the morphology of the coatings (Figure 1C).  In the first 7 days of the growth stage for 

both conditions, it is possible to observe that the size of CaP nuclei increased, forming a 

dense and compact CaP film. This means that immersion in SBF solution promotes the 

growth of CaP layer over time.  At higher magnifications, after 7 days of growth, the

150 

morphology of the coatings is similar in the presence and absence of lysozyme, 

demonstrating the typical cauliflower morphology (Figures 1D1 and 1E1). Lysozyme 

incorporation into the coatings did not affect the morphology and growth of the coatings as a 

function of immersion time.

scale bar is 50 ?m for images A-E and 5 ?m for images B1-E1.

Figure 2A presents the infrared spectra of CaP coatings with and without lysozyme 

(control) at nucleation stage.  Analysis of CaP coatings in absence of lysozyme shows the 

presence of phosphate (PO4
3-) groups (bands at 1055, 602 and 556 cm-1). Moreover, the 

presence of carbonate (CO3
2-) bands (1492 cm-1 and 1441 cm-1) was detected. When 

lysozyme was added at nucleation stage, the same phosphate and carbonate groups were 

also detected (Figure 2A). In the spectrum of CaP coating with lysozyme, the appearance of 

amide I band (1656 cm-1) was observed indicating that lysozyme is incorporated in the 

coating. The amide I band represents the stretching vibrations of C=O bonds in the backbone 

of the proteins 22,25. FTIR spectra of both CaP coatings, with and without lysozyme, confirmed 

an apatite layer formation on the surface of the scaffolds, with similar composition of the 

major mineral component of the bone26.  

TF-XRD analyses were performed to determine whether the CaP coatings were 

crystalline or amorphous.  Figure 2B shows TF-XRD patterns of CaP coatings in the absence 

and presence of lysozyme. No crystalline peaks were detected for CaP coated chitosan 

scaffolds with or without incorporated lysozyme at nucleation stage (Figures 2Bb and 2Bc). 

After 7 days of growth, two characteristic peaks of hydroxyapatite are visible in the diffraction 

patterns of CaP coatings in the presence and absence of lysozyme, which are confirmed by 

comparison to an XRD pattern of standard hydroxyapatite (JCPDS 9-432) (Figures 2Bd and 

2Be). These TF-XRD patterns confirm the formation of apatite layer owing to the presence of 

apatite peaks. However, the apatite formed appears to be mainly amorphous. These results 

together with FTIR spectra suggest that the mineral formed is a carbonate apatite mineral 

similar to the major mineral component of bone.

3.2. Degradation studies 

The degradation behavior of the chitosan scaffolds developed (uncoated chitosan 

scaffolds, CaP coated chitosan scaffolds with and without incorporated lysozyme) was 

investigated by incubation in buffer solutions for different periods of time. To simulate in vivo 

conditions and the ability of in situ pore formation, two different pHs were tested: pH 7.4 to 

simulate normal physiological conditions; and pH 5 to simulate inflammatory response. 

On analysis of the weight loss profile at pH 7.4 (Figure 3A), all scaffolds presented 

gradual weight loss as a function of degradation time. The lowest weight loss was observed 

for uncoated chitosan scaffolds, with almost 4% after 60 days. The corresponding SEM 

images show an increase in the surface roughness as a function of immersion time (Figures 

4D, 4G and 4J). These observations are in accordance with weight loss results (Figure 3A). 

The CaP coated chitosan scaffolds presented a significant weight loss of 7.6 ± 0.2% after 60 

days (Figure 3A).  

 

Figure 3. Weight loss profile of uncoated chitosan scaffolds, CaP coated chitosan scaffolds, CaP 

coated chitosan scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme as a function of immersion time at pH 7.4 (A) 

and pH 5 (B). (*) indicates a significant difference between time points for each condition. At pH 7.4 for 

each time point all difference between conditions is significant. (**) indicates a significant difference 

between conditions at the same time point. The weight loss at pH 5 for chitosan scaffolds is 

significantly different when compared with pH 7.4. 

 

SEM images show several changes in the CaP coatings morphology after only 3 days 

of immersion at pH 7.4, suggesting that the coatings may be gradually dissolved with time

Concept for Tissue Engineering Combining a Self-Regulated Degradation System with In Situ Pore Formation 

153 

(Figures 4E, 4H and 4K). CaP coated chitosan scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme 

presented the highest weight loss as compared with the other two conditions (uncoated 

chitosan and CaP coated chitosan scaffolds), presenting a significant weight loss of 

approximately 9% after 14 days, which slightly increases to 11.5 ± 1.0 % upon 60 days of 

immersion (Figure 3A). Analysing SEM images (Figures 4C, 4F, 4I and 4L), some differences 

between the coatings in Tris-HCl pH 7.4 were observed as a function of immersion time. 

However, these differences are not pronounced when compared with CaP coatings in the 

absence of lysozyme. Lysozyme seems to promote the degradation of chitosan scaffolds 

surfaces, as it is possible to observe the highest weight loss when lysozyme is present. 

These findings are corroborated by the results of enzyme activity that showed that the 

enzyme present on the coatings was still active after 30 days (Figure 6A). Nevertheless, 

immersion periods at pH 7.4 up to 30 days induced roughness in the surface of uncoated 

chitosan scaffolds (Figures 4D, 4 G and 4J), and changes of the CaP coating morphology (in 

the case of CaP coated chitosan scaffolds with and without incorporated lysozyme). 

However, all scaffolds were coated with a CaP layer, meaning that the coatings are quite 

stable at normal physiological pH. 

The results of degradation studies performed at pH 5 are shown in Figure 3B. The 

same trend was observed for the weight loss results at pH 7.4. Coated scaffolds with 

incorporated lysozyme exhibited a faster degradation rate, when compared with the other 

two conditions (uncoated chitosan and CaP coated chitosan scaffolds) (Figure 3B). This 

indicates the role of this enzyme on the hydrolysis of chitosan. These results are confirmed 

by the results of enzyme activity at pH 5, which show that lysozyme is active at that pH 

(Figure 6B). Independent of the pH, the presence of lysozyme seems to control the 

degradation rate of the scaffolds. 

Analysing the SEM images of uncoated chitosan scaffolds after 14 days of 

degradation at pH 5, it is possible to observe increased degradation with immersion time 

(Figures 5A, 5D, 5G, 5J and 5M). After only 3 days, evident changes are observed on the 

surface of uncoated chitosan scaffolds (Figure 6D). This appears to be related with high 

susceptibility of chitosan at acidic pH. In Figures 5E, 5H, 5K and 5N, the images of CaP 

coated chitosan scaffolds after different times at pH 5 are presented. After 1 hour almost all 

CaP layer was dissolved (data not shown), and it was non-existent after 1 day of degradation 

(Figure 5E). SEM images evidence the formation of pores after only 1 day, but the formation 

of interconnected pores is not clearly visible (Figures 5E, 5H, 5K and 5N). 

The most interesting results were obtained for CaP coated scaffolds with incorporated 

lysozyme (Figures 5F, 5I, 5L and 5O).  The degradation effect of lysozyme on chitosan is 



CHAPTER VI. Chitosan Scaffolds Incorporating Lysozyme into CaP Coatings Produced by a Biomimetic Route: A Novel 
Concept for Tissue Engineering Combining a Self-Regulated Degradation System with In Situ Pore Formation 

154 

clearly visible from the emergence of a highly porous structure with time (Figures 5F, 5I, 5L 

and 5O). After 1 hour, it is possible to observe a CaP layer on the surface of scaffolds (data 

not shown). However, after 1 day, as previously described, the dissolution of the coatings 

and pore formation as a function of degradation time was observed.  In this case, the 

formation of pores is clearly visible after 7 days with a structure having interconnected pores 

(Figures 5L and 5L1). After 14 days, the scaffolds exhibit pores with diameter of 

approximately 50-300 ?m (Figure 5O1). This pore formation is corroborated by the weight 

loss results. The CaP coated chitosan scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme presented the 

highest weight loss. In addition, lysozyme activity measurements at pH 5 showed that this 

enzyme is active.

156 

The incorporation of lysozyme into CaP coatings, grown on the surface of chitosan 

scaffolds may be used as a strategy to control their degradation rate better. Both degradation 

studies (pH 7.4 and pH 5) show that the presence of lysozyme enhanced the degradation of 

chitosan scaffolds. The pH of the degradation media has a remarkable influence on CaP 

coatings. At pH 7.4, all scaffolds remained coated up to 60 days. However, at pH 5, after 1 

day, the dissolution of the coatings and formation of pores was observed mostly when due to 

the presence of lysozyme. These results show that lysozyme has an important role in the 

degradation of chitosan scaffolds. CaP coated chitosan scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme 

presented the highest values of weight loss at both pH 7.4 and pH 5. At pH 7.4, no effect of 

lysozyme on the scaffold morphology was evident. Nevertheless, it enhanced the formation 

of a porous structure with interconnected pores at pH 5. 

 

3.3. Lysozyme activity in solution and released from the coatings  

Evaluation of the activity of the lysozyme released from the coatings (Figure 6A) 

revealed that the enzyme was able to hydrolyze the peptidoglycan of the bacteria cell walls 

(as detected by the decrease in optical density with time). The results of this study (Figure 

6A) showed that the enzyme remained active after 30 days of immersion in buffer solution 

(pH 7.4). 

  Changes in the pH of the environment can alter or inhibit enzyme activity. In order to 

confirm that lysozyme is active at both pH 5 and pH 7.4, known lysozyme concentrations 

were used to construct a calibration curve. OD slopes were determined for different lysozyme 

concentrations (Figure 6B) and an increase in enzymatic activity as a function of increasing 

lysozyme concentration was observed. Lysozyme is active at pH 5 and pH 7.4. The OD 

slope for the first 5 minutes in the graph was also calculated (Figure 6A) to determine 

lysozyme activity released from the coatings. The activity of lysozyme released from the 

coatings was 0.0375 U (1U corresponds to the amount of enzyme which decreases the 

absorbance at 450 nm per minute at pH 7.4, 37ºC using a suspension of Micrococcus 

lysodeikticus as substrate).

4. CONCLUSIONS 

In this work, lysozyme was successfully incorporated into CaP coatings produced on 

the surface of chitosan scaffolds, using a biomimetic technique. Degradation studies at pH 

7.4 to simulate normal physiological conditions showed that the morphology of uncoated 

scaffolds and CaP coatings changed. However, the formation of pores as a function of 

immersion time was not observed.  Moreover, CaP coatings are very stable at pH 7.4 and, 

after 30 days, all scaffolds remained covered with a CaP layer. At pH 5, to simulate an in vivo 

inflammatory response, a porous structure was formed when lysozyme was incorporated into 

the CaP coatings. The degradation effect of lysozyme on chitosan at pH 5 is clearly visible 

from the appearance of pores. In addition, at high magnifications, SEM images suggest that 

these pores are interconnected. It was also shown that lysozyme incorporated into the 

coatings was active after 30 days of immersion in buffer solution (pH 7.4). This approach is 

very promising, as the presence of lysozyme incorporated into the coatings will allow 

chitosan scaffolds with gradual in vivo pore-forming ability and antibacterial properties that 

can simultaneously exhibit osteoconductive properties via the presence of CaP coating to be 

obtained.

ABSTRACT 

This work proposes the use of non-porous, “smart” and stimulus responsive chitosan-

based scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications. The overall vision is to use 

biodegradable scaffolds based on chitosan and starch that present properties that will be 

regulated by bone regeneration, with the capability of gradual in situ pore formation. 

Biomimetic calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings were used as a strategy to incorporate 

lysozyme at the surface of chitosan-based materials with the main objective of controlling 

and tailoring their degradation profile as a function of immersion time. In order to confirm the 

concept, degradation tests with a lysozyme concentration similar to that incorporated into 

CaP chitosan-based scaffolds was used to study the degradation of the scaffolds and the 

formation of pores as a function of immersion time. Degradation studies with lysozyme (1.5 

g/L) showed the formation of pores, indicating an increase of porosity (~5% - 55% up to 21 

days) resulting in porous three-dimensional (3D) structures with interconnected pores. 

Additional studies investigated the influence of a CaP biomimetic coating on osteogenic 

differentiation of rat marrow stromal cells (MSCs) and showed enhanced differentiation of rat 

MSCs seeded on the CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds with lysozyme incorporated. At 

all culture times, CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme 

demonstrated greater osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs, bone matrix production, and 

mineralization as demonstrated by calcium deposition measurements, compared with 

controls (uncoated scaffolds). The ability of these CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds with 

incorporated lysozyme to create an interconnected pore network in situ coupled with the 

demonstrated positive effect of these scaffolds upon osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs and

mineralized matrix production illustrate the strong potential of these scaffolds for application 

in bone tissue engineering strategies. 

 

1. INTRODUCTION 

Tissue engineering strategies include two general categories: (1) the use of acellular 

matrices (artificial scaffolds or decellularized tissues), which depend upon the natural ability 

of the body to regenerate for proper orientation and direction of new tissue growth, and (2) 

the use of scaffolds with cells (1, 2). The typical strategy involves the use of a porous 

scaffold, which serves as a transplantation vehicle for cultured cells and a template to guide 

tissue regeneration, thereby playing an important role in transforming the cell seeded 

scaffold into a new tissue. To allow a high density of colonizing cells and to promote 

neovascularization when implanted in vivo, the scaffolds should have high porosity, large 

surface area, mechanical properties and pore sizes appropriate for the application, and a 

highly interconnected pore structure (1). In addition, biocompatibility and biodegradability are 

also required properties. Bone regeneration is a complex series of events involving 

proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts, bone matrix 

production and mineralization (3). 

As extensively described in the literature, scaffold porosity is inversely related to the 

mechanical properties of the scaffold, thus it is necessary to balance the mechanical needs 

of the particular tissue that is going to be replaced and the scaffold porosity sufficient to allow 

tissue growth (4, 5). Therefore, this work proposes the use of non-porous scaffolds 

composed of an in vivo responsive material that will be regulated by bone regeneration, with 

gradual in situ pore formation and consequent scaffold resorption (6). This novel approach 

includes the use of “smart” and stimulus responsive scaffolds that might be “intelligent” 

enough to control their degradation profile as a function of implantation time and to induce 

osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. 

Chitosan has been considered to be a promising material for tissue engineering applications 

(7-9). It is a linear copolymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-glucosamine, derived from 

the deacetylation of chitin. The deacetylation degree measures the percentage of 

glucosamine units in the polymer chain and influences its physicochemical properties such 

as solubility, crystallinity, swelling behaviour and biological properties (10), such as 

osteogenesis enhancement (11-13). The N-acetylglucosamine present in chitosan is also 

responsible for nitric oxide production by rat peritoneal exudate macrophages (14) at 

reasonable levels in terms of inflammatory response but very effective in terms of wound

tissue repair (15). It has been also demonstrated that chitosan is degraded in vitro and in 

vivo by lysozyme (15-17), an enzyme ubiquitous in the human body. Moreover, hydrolytic 

actions of lysozyme are able to activate macrophages and to promote collagen deposition. 

The biocompatibility of chitosan might be attributed to its structural similarity to 

glycosaminoglycan, which is a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of bone 

and cartilage (12).   

Starch was used as a component of the scaffolds presented in this study as a sacrifice 

material that will be easily degraded by several enzymes occurring in the human body (6). 

Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that starch-based biomaterials are 

biocompatible (18-20) and biodegradable (6, 21, 22). The main enzymes involved in starch 

degradation are ?-amylases, ?-amylases, ?-glucosidases, glucoamylases, and other 

debranching enzymes (pullulanase and isoamylase) (23, 24).  The enzymatic degradation 

products of starch hydrolysis are mainly glucose, maltose and dextrin (24). 

Chitosan and starch scaffolds typically do not present adequate bone bonding, 

osteoconductive or osteoinductive properties for bone tissue engineering applications. One 

possible solution is to apply on the surface of 3D structures a calcium phosphate (CaP) 

biomimetic coating with a composition similar to the major inorganic component of bone, 

hydroxyapatite (HA). In addition, biomimetic CaP coatings have been considered as potential 

carriers of bioactive proteins without compromising their activity, as they are generated under 

physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37ºC) (22, 25-28). It has been shown that different proteins 

can be directly integrated into the structure of CaP coatings without compromising their 

activity, and their release is mainly controlled by the dissolution mechanism of the coating 

(22, 25-27). In this sense, biomimetic coatings were used to tailor the material surface 

properties or to directly enhance cell adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. 

Moreover, CaP coatings are used as a means to functionalize biomaterials with biological 

affinity and protein adsorption properties, as previously mentioned (28). The incorporation of 

different enzymes into CaP coatings, prepared on the surface of scaffolds by means of a 

biomimetic coating technique seems to be a very interesting strategy to control their 

degradation rate. In this work, lysozyme was incorporated into the coatings with the aim of 

developing a self-regulating degradable material with a capacity for gradual in situ pore 

formation. In addition, this system can simultaneously exhibit osteoinductive and 

osteoconductive properties in the sense that it can act as a carrier system for the controlled 

release of multiple biologically active proteins. In the past decade, a large number of 

publications showed osteoinduction by calcium phosphate coatings in several animal models 

(29, 30). Recent research has shown that the biological performance of osteoinductive

166 

biomaterials, namely on new bone growth orthotopically, is significantly better than non-

osteoinductive biomaterials (30). 

The present study reports the use of CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds with 

incorporated lysozyme. This study was designed to answer the following questions: How 

does lysozyme influence the formation of pores in chitosan scaffolds, using a similar 

concentration to the one incorporated into CaP coatings? 2) Does this concentration of 

lysozyme allow the formation of interconnected pores? 3) Are CaP coated chitosan-based 

scaffolds able to enhance osteogenic differentiation of rat MSCs compared with uncoated 

(without CaP coating) scaffolds? 

 

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

2.1. Materials 

In this work, degradable scaffolds based on chitosan and corn starch were 

developed. Two different compositions were prepared using a precipitation method (7): 

chitosan (Ch) and chitosan/starch scaffolds (CS). Briefly, chitosan was dissolved in acetic 

acid 1% (v/v) to obtain a 5% (w/v) solution. Then, using the same procedure, another 

formulation was prepared with the following ratio: 60/40 chitosan/starch. The chitosan and 

chitosan/starch solutions were cast into moulds and frozen (-18ºC) overnight (6). They were 

then immersed in a precipitation solution (25% (v) NaOH 1M and 75% (v) Na2SO4 0.5M) 

overnight, adapted from (7). After precipitation, the samples were washed several times with 

distilled water to remove excess salt from the precipitation solution.  After this procedure, two 

other formulations were prepared based on biomimetic coating methodology (31, 32), 

consisting of an impregnation of the materials with bioactive glass called Bioglass? (45S5) 

supplied by NovaMin Technology (Alachua, Florida, USA) followed by an immersion in a 

simulated body fluid (SBF, 37ºC, pH 7.4), presenting ionic concentrations similar to human 

blood plasma. Briefly, chitosan (Ch) and chitosan/starch (CS) scaffolds were immersed in a 

wet bed of bioglass for 6 hours in a rotator. After that, the scaffolds where immersed in 

simulated body fluid (1.0 SBF) solution with lysozyme (1 g/L) for 7 days at 37ºC (nucleation 

stage). This stage allows for the formation of CaP nuclei. After the nucleation stage, all 

samples were washed with distilled water and immersed in a concentrated simulated body 

fluid solution (1.5 SBF) for 7 days at 37ºC in order to enhance CaP nuclei growth. Two 

different samples were obtained after the biomimetic coating technique: CaP chitosan 

scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme (CaP/Ch + lysozyme) and CaP chitosan/starch 

scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme (CaP/CS + lysozyme) (33).

2.2. Degradation studies 

Degradation studies were performed in triplicate by incubating the chitosan scaffolds 

(Ch) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution (pH 7.4) with lysozyme (1.5 g/L), a 

concentration similar to the ones incorporated into CaP biomimetic coatings, at 37ºC up to 21 

days. Lysozyme solution was changed every 7 days. At the end of the degradation period, 

the samples were removed, washed with distilled water and dried in a graded series of 

ethanol for later calculation of weight loss. The porosity, pore interconnectivity, pore size and 

three-dimensional structures of dry chitosan scaffolds were analysed before and after 

degradation by micro-computed tomography (µ -CT). 

 

2.3. Micro-Computed Tomography (?-CT) 

The scaffolds were analysed using micro-Computed Tomography (µ-CT) before and 

after degradation with lysozyme for the different periods of immersion (0, 3, 14 and 21 days). 

µ-CT was carried out using a Skyscan 1072 (Skyscan, Kontich, Belgium) (pixel size 

resolution of 6.59 ?m), with X-ray source settings of 40 keV and 250 ?A. The data sets were 

acquired over a rotation range of 180° (0.45° rotation step) and reconstructed with software 

(NRecon v1.4.3, SkyScan). Representative data sets were segmented with a dynamic 

threshold of 40-255 and were used for morphometric analysis (CT Analyser, v1.5.1.5, 

SkyScan) and to build the 3D models (ANT 3D creator, v2.4, SkyScan). The morphometric 

analysis included porosity, pore interconnectivity, mean pore size and mean fiber thickness. 

3D virtual models of representative regions in the bulk of the scaffolds were created, 

visualized and registered using both image processing software packages to access the 

morphological changes after degradation (CT Analyser and ANT 3D creator).  The 

interconnectivity was quantified as the accessible void fraction over a range of minimum 

connection sizes using an analysis software tool (CT Analyser, v1.5.1.5, SkyScan). A 3D 

shrink-wrap process was performed to shrink the outside boundary of the volume of interest 

(VOI) in a scaffold through any openings whose size was equal to or larger than ~50 µm. Any 

pore size below this value was considered to be a closed pore, based upon reported 

minimum pore interconnection sizes for bone tissue ingrowth (34). Interconnectivity was 

calculated as follows (35): 

Interconnectivity = (Vt -Vsw)/(Vt - Vm) × 100% 

where Vt is the total volume of the VOI, Vsw is the VOI volume after 3D shrink-wrap 

processing, and Vm is the volume of scaffold material.

168 

The wall thickness was defined as the pore wall thickness and was quantified with ?-

CT analysis based upon structural indices using a software tool (CT Analyser, v1.5.1.5, 

SkyScan). Specifically, quantitative analysis of the pore wall thickness was retrieved from the 

3D analysis using structure thickness (St.Th) parameters. 

 

2.4. MSCs isolation 

Rat marrow stromal cells (MSCs) were obtained from femurs and tibias of 41-44 days 

old male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, USA) using the method described by 

Maniatoupoulos et al. (36). The harvested cells were cultured until confluence in a humidified 

atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37ºC. Non-adherent cells were removed after 1 and 3 days. 

Upon reaching confluence, the cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended in a 

known amount of medium and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain a final concentration 

of 3x106 cells/ml. This cell suspension was then aliquoted into cryotubes for storage in liquid 

nitrogen (~1 ml/cryotube).  

 

2.5. Cell seeding 

Chitosan-based scaffolds with 6 mm diameter and thickness of 0.8-1.0 mm were 

press fit into 6 mm diameter cassettes and covered with complete osteogenic medium [?-

MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) from Cambrex/BioWhittaker 

(Walkersville, MD), 50 ?g/ml gentamicin, 100 ?g/ml ampicilin, 10 mM fungizone, 50 ?g/ml L-

ascorbic acid, 0.01 M ?-glycerophosphate, and 10-8 M dexamethasone] overnight. After 1 

day, each scaffold was seeded with 280,000 cells contained in 100 ?l of complete osteogenic 

media in accordance with previous studies (37, 38). Three hours after cell seeding, 10 ml of 

complete osteogenic media was added to each well of a 6-well plate. After 24 hours of 

attachment, the scaffolds were placed in new 6-well plates for 8, 16 and 21 days with 

complete osteogenic medium. Media were changed every 3 days. Each group consisted of n 

= 6 samples. 

At the end of each culture period, samples were removed from the cassettes and 

rinsed with phosphate buffered saline solution. Three samples from each group were stored 

at -20ºC in ddH2O until analyses were performed. One of the remaining 3 samples was 

immersed in PBS with calcein-AM for 45 minutes for observation under confocal microscopy, 

and the other two samples were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for FTIR analysis and for 

observation under SEM.

2.6. DNA analysis 

Measurement of the cell number in chitosan-based scaffolds was assessed from cell 

lysates using the Picogreen dsDNA Quantification Kit according to the instructions of the 

manufacturer (Molecular Probes). All standards and samples were prepared in triplicate. The 

fluorescence at 545 nm was read on a plate reader (FLx800, Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., 

Winooski, Vermont) to determine DNA concentrations per scaffold. The cellularity of each 

scaffold was calculated by correlation with the DNA concentrations measured from a known 

number of marrow stromal cells.  

 

2.7. Alkaline phosphatase activity measurements 

Alkaline phosphatase activity assays were performed on cell lysates using an 

established protocol (37). All reagents were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). All 

samples were prepared in triplicate and compared against p-nitrophenol standards. The 

reaction was stopped by adding 100 ?l of 0.3 N NaOH. Absorbance was read at 405 nm on a 

plate reader (PowerWave x340; Bio-Tek Inc., Winooski, Vermont) to determine the alkaline 

phosphatase activity per scaffold. 

 

2.8. Calcium deposition measurement 

Calcium deposition measurements were made in triplicate. CaP coated chitosan-

based scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme without cells at the end of each time period were 

used as controls to determine the calcium content of the coating. Then, these values were 

subtracted from the calcium content obtained by CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds with 

incorporated lysozyme cultured with cells to normalize the data. Calcium deposition was 

evaluated using a calcium assay from Diagnostic Chemicals Limited. After ALP and DNA 

assays were completed, a volume of 1N acetic acid equal to the remaining volume was 

added to each well (for a final concentration of 0.5 N), and the plate was placed on an orbital 

shaker overnight. A volume of 300 ?l of calcium assay reagent was added to 20 ?l of sample 

solution in 96-well plates. All samples were assessed in triplicate.  To generate a standard 

curve, serial dilutions of CaCl2 were prepared (0-50 ?g/ml). Absorbance was read at 650 nm 

with a spectrophotometer plate reader (PowerWave x340; Bio-Tek Inc., Winooski, Vermont). 

The calcium deposition in each scaffold is reported as ?g Ca2+.

2.9. Microscopy analysis 

After each time period, chitosan-based scaffolds were removed from the cassettes, 

washed with PBS and stained with calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) according to the 

manufacturer’s instructions. After 45 minutes immersion in PBS with calcein-AM, images 

were recorded using a laser scanning confocal microscope with a 10x APO objective (Zeiss 

LSM 510 Axiovert, Carl Zeiss, Germany). Samples for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 

were washed twice in PBS and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 minutes. Then, the 

scaffolds were washed with PBS and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and dried 

after immersion in hexamethyldisilazane.  

 

2.10. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance 

(FTIR-ATR) 

Chitosan-based scaffolds before (control samples) and after 16 days of culture were 

analysed by FTIR-ATR. The scaffolds were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, dehydrated in a 

graded series of ethanol and dried at room temperature. All spectra were recorded using 64 

scans and 4 cm-1 in a FTIR spectrophotometer (IR Prestige-21, Fourier Transformer infrared 

spectrophotometer, Shimadzu).  

 

2.11. Statistics 

Results of DNA, ALP, and calcium assays are expressed as mean ? standard 

deviation with n=3 for each group. Statistically significant differences were determined using 

Student’s t-test multiple comparison procedure at a confidence interval of 95% (p &amp;lt;0.05).  

 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1. Degradation studies 

The degradation of chitosan in the human body has been reported to be carried out 

by lysozyme (16, 17). Previous studies have identified the optimal concentration of lysozyme 

for the degradation of chitosan-based scaffolds in vitro to be 1.5 g/L (33).  Accordingly, a 

lysozyme concentration of 1.5 g/L was used in the present study for optimal degradation of 

the chitosan-based scaffolds, as well as to approximate the concentration of similar enzymes 

previously incorporated into biomimetic CaP coatings (22) and the concentration of lysozyme

incorporated into the CaP coatings in the present study (37, 38). As observed in Figure 1, 

chitosan scaffolds were degraded gradually as a function of immersion time in lysozyme 

solution (1.5 g/L). The weight loss (%) after 3, 7, 14 and 21 days was: 11.6 ± 0.5, 14.9 ± 0.4, 

15.6 ± 0.4 and 18.2 ± 1.1, respectively (Figure 1). This gradual weight loss is confirmed by 

images obtained by ?-CT, where an almost non-porous structure before degradation was 

observed (Figure 2A) with a significant increase in porosity after different time periods, being 

obvious after 14 days (Figure 2D) and 21 days (Figure 2E). These results demonstrate the 

ability of lysozyme to induce degradation and subsequent formation of pores into chitosan 

scaffolds.

Figure 2. Images of chitosan (Ch) scaffolds obtained by ?-CT: before degradation (A),  after  3 days (B), 

7 days (C), 14 days (D), and 21 days (E) of degradation with lysozyme (1.5 g/L). Lysozyme solution 

induced degradation and enhanced subsequent formation of pores in chitosan scaffolds as a function of 

immersion time. 

 

Upon analysing the images of chitosan (Ch) scaffolds obtained by ?-CT, it is possible 

to see the increase of porosity as a function of immersion time (Figure 2). The control 

scaffolds (before degradation) presented ~5% porosity. According to Figure 3A lysozyme 

enhanced the porosity of the scaffolds as a function of degradation time. After different time 

points, lysozyme had a significant effect on chitosan scaffolds, inducing the formation of a 

porous structure (Figure 2 and Figure 3A). Furthermore, the interconnectivity of chitosan 

scaffolds increased significantly after 21 days (Figure 3B). Moreover, the effect of lysozyme 

was also detected in pore size and wall thickness results (Figures 4A and 4B), where a 

significant increase in size of pores (Figure 4A) and a significant decrease of wall thickness 

(Figure 4B) was evident compared with control scaffolds (before degradation). These results 

were expected since after different periods of degradation with lysozyme the formation of 

pores was observed, evidencing a significant increase of porosity as a function of

3.2. Assays 

Confocal microscopy images after 8 days show that rat marrow stromal cells were 

able to adhere to all scaffold formulations and maintain their viability. Cells covered the 

surface of all scaffolds, and no differences can be observed among groups (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Laser scanning confocal microscope images of cells stained with calcein-AM at the top 

surface of scaffolds after 8 days: (A) chitosan (Ch); (B) CaP coated chitosan scaffolds with incorporated 

lysozyme; (C) chitosan/starch (CS) and (D) CaP coated chitosan/starch scaffolds with incorporated 

lysozyme. All images obtained 45 minutes after incubation with calcein-AM using a 10X APO objective. 

The scale bar is 100 µm and applies to all images. Rat MSCs adhered to all scaffold formulations and 

maintained viability after 8 days of culture, with no differences observed among the groups. 

 

 Scaffold cellularity is presented in Figure 6. It should be noted that for cases in which 

cells were completely entrapped within extracellular matrix produced during culture, such that 

the DNA therein could not be fully liberated for inclusion in the lysate for assessment of 

cellularity, then the measured results may reflect an underestimation of the actual number of 

cells on/within the scaffold, especially at later time points. However, an increase in cell 

number indicating cell proliferation was observed between day 16 and day 21 for all groups. 

The number of cells after 8 days was lower than was expected, except for CaP coated 

chitosan/starch with incorporated lysozyme. This can be related to the small surface area of 

scaffolds where cells were seeded and explained by a lack of initial porosity in these 

scaffolds. However after 21 days, a significant increase was observed in the number of cells 

for CaP coated chitosan scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme which corresponds to the 

increase in porosity as a function of time, as was shown in the degradation results (Figure 1). 

During the time of culture with MSCs, it was expected that lysozyme would be able to 

degrade CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds, inducing the formation of pores by lysozyme 

and allowing the penetration and colonization of cells into the scaffolds, as shown in Figure 

7B after 21 days.

 The use of biomimetic coating methodology in this study allowed the incorporation of 

lysozyme that will be able to degrade chitosan-based scaffolds. It is expected that CaP 

coatings will enhance the osteoconductive properties of the resulting materials. The SEM 

images after 8 days show cells attached to scaffold surfaces, however after 16 and 21 days 

all surfaces were completely colonized by the cells, and after 21 days mineralized matrix was 

observed on CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds (Figure 7A), clearly visible at high 

magnifications for scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme (Figure 7B). These results 

corroborate the calcium content measurements, where calcium was detected after 16 and 21 

days (Figure 9). Additionally, small pores were observed in the dense layer for CaP/CS + 

lysozyme at high magnifications after 8 and 21 days. These pores seem to be induced by the 

action of lysozyme present in CaP coatings (Figure 7B).

 Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme expressed by cells and is an early marker of 

osteoblastic differentiation in MSCs (39). CaP/CS + lysozyme and uncoated scaffolds (Ch 

and CS) reached their maximum measured ALP activity on day 8 and 16, respectively 

(Figure 8), reflecting the early osteogenic differentiation stage of the MSCs. The highest 

value of ALP activity for CaP/Ch + lysozyme was obtained at day 21, however the difference 

between the 16th and 21st days was not statistically significant.

and 21 days. Results are expressed as means ? standard deviation with n=3 for each bar. (*) indicates a

 Calcium deposition is an indicator of the level of mineral deposition, which is a marker 

of the full maturation of osteoblastic cells. No calcified extracellular matrix deposition was 

observed at day 8 (Figure 9). After 16 days calcium deposition was detected for CaP coated 

chitosan-based scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme. At the end of the 3rd week, the calcium 

measurements indicated the deposition of significant amounts of mineralized matrix for all 

scaffolds, with a significant increase for CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds with 

incorporated lysozyme (Figure 9). The amount of calcium detected on CaP coated scaffolds 

was higher for both time points of CaP/Ch + lysozyme, however when comparing cellularity 

(Figure 6), it is apparent  that the number of cells was also higher, indicating that the lower

178 

number of cells present in CaP/CS + lysozyme also were able to produce mineralized 

extracellular matrix. Nevertheless, when comparing the number of cells present in these two 

scaffolds with the calcium content, both scaffolds had a similar effect on the cells. Indeed, 

comparison of cellularity results (Figure 6) and ALP activity results (Figure 8) reveals that the 

maximum ALP activity occurred at either day 16 or 21 for all groups except the CaP/CS + 

lysozyme group.  As ALP activity is an early marker of osteoblastic differentiation of cells, 

and as cellular differentiation and proliferation are inversely proportional, it follows that a 

minimum in cellularity at day 16 may reasonably correspond with a peak in ALP activity at 

day 16.  Further, the presence of mineralized matrix, as measured by calcium content of 

constructs, increased with time for all groups, indicating the osteogenic differentiation of cells 

in all groups, although this effect was most pronounced in the CaP coated scaffolds with 

incorporated lysozyme.

3.3. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-

ATR) 

Analysing FTIR-ATR spectra of controls (without cells) of chitosan (Ch) and 

chitosan/starch (CS) scaffolds, the characteristic bands of chitosan (1150–890 cm-1) were 

detected (Figures 10A and 10C). After 16 and 21 days of culture (Figures 10A and 10C), 

these spectra showed the presence of amide bands: 1650 cm-1 (amide I) and 1542 cm-1 

(amide II), which can be related to protein matrix formation.  Carbonate groups at 1500-1418 

cm-1 were also detected (Figures 10A and 10B).  These carbonate groups are related to 

carbonate apatite, one of the calcium phosphates present in bone tissue, suggesting the 

presence of mineralized extracellular matrix. In Figures 10B and 10D are presented the 

spectra of CaP/Ch with incorporated lysozyme and CaP/CS with incorporated lysozyme 

scaffolds. In FTIR-ATR spectra of the CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds when lysozyme 

was incorporated, the presence of amide I and amide II in uncultured scaffolds (controls) was 

detected (Figures 10B and 10D). The amide I band represents the stretching vibrations of 

C=O bonds in the backbone of the protein (40). Furthermore, the amide II band arises from 

the combination of C-N stretching and N-H bending vibrations of the protein backbone (40). 

These bands obtained in the case of the control samples could indicate the adsorption of 

lysozyme on the surface of chitosan and chitosan/starch scaffolds. However, an increase of 

intensity of these bands was observed as a function of culture time (Figures 10B and 10D). 

As previously mentioned, these might indicate a protein matrix formation. In the spectra of 

control scaffolds (Figures 10B and 10D), carbonate bands (1500-1418 cm-1) were also 

detected, which are associated with CaP coating on the surface of the scaffolds. In addition, 

these bands became more intense with culture time, suggesting the formation of mineralized 

extracellular matrix. However, phosphate bands (1190-976 cm-1) were not clearly detected, 

which was likely related to overlapping with the polysaccharide ring band of chitosan (1150-

890 cm-1). 

FTIR-ATR results confirm the calcium measurements results, clearly suggesting 

protein matrix formation and the presence of mineralized extracellular matrix. Furthermore, 

these results suggest that the mineral formed by rat marrow stromal cells cultured for 16 and 

21 days is carbonate apatite mineral similar to the major mineral component of bone.

4. CONCLUSIONS 

The degradation studies performed with lysozyme using similar concentration to 

those incorporated into CaP coatings showed the formation of pores as a function of 

immersion time, indicating an increase of porosity ~5% - 55% up to 21 days. Lysozyme had a 

significant effect on chitosan scaffolds resulting in porous 3D structures with interconnected 

pores (~78%). On the basis of these studies it was concluded that CaP biomimetic coatings

181 

with incorporated lysozyme enhance osteogenic differentiation of rat marrow stromal cells. 

Therefore, the use of CaP biomimetic coating strategy with incorporated lysozyme on the 

surface of chitosan-based scaffolds provides an improved environment for rat marrow 

stromal cell differentiation along the osteogenic lineage when compared with uncoated 

scaffolds, as was shown by calcium deposition measurements and FTIR-ATR results, 

indicating the production of mineralized extracellular matrix.  The demonstrated ability of 

these novel surface coated scaffolds to form an interconnected pore structure in situ coupled 

with the positive effect of these scaffolds on the osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs and 

mineralized matrix production clearly illustrate the strong potential of these scaffolds for 

application in bone tissue engineering strategies.

In Vivo Responsive Self-Regulated Degradation System with In Situ Pore 

Formation Ability: A Novel Strategy for Bone Tissue Engineering1 

 

ABSTRACT 

Previously, we have studied the in vitro application of a self-regulating degradable 

material with gradual in situ pore formation ability. For the aim of those studies, lysozyme 

was incorporated into biomimetic calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings at the surface of 

chitosan-based scaffolds in order to control the scaffold degradation and subsequent pore 

formation. With the goal of validating the concept in vivo, a rat subcutaneous model was 

used to investigate the degradation of the scaffolds and the in situ pore formation. Chitosan 

or chitosan/starch scaffolds were studied with or without a CaP coating in the presence or 

absence of lysozyme for a total of 6 experimental groups. Twenty four scaffolds per group 

were implanted, and eight scaffolds were retrieved at each of three time points (3, 6 and 12 

weeks). Harvested samples were analyzed for weight loss, micro-computed tomography, and 

histological analysis. All scaffolds showed pronounced weight loss and pore formation as a 

function of time. Nevertheless, the highest weight loss at week 12 was 29.8 ± 1.5% for CaP 

chitosan/starch scaffolds with lysozyme incorporated. All experimental groups showed a 

significant increase in porosity after 12 weeks. At all time points no adverse tissue reaction 

was observed, and as degradation increased, histological analysis showed cellular ingrowth 

throughout the implants. Using this innovative methodology, the ability to gradually generate 

pores in situ was clearly demonstrated in vivo.

1. INTRODUCTION 

The evaluation of a bone tissue engineering constructs in a subcutaneous model in 

vivo is often the first step following in vitro characterization. In previous studies we proposed 

the use of non-porous, stimulus responsive chitosan-based scaffolds with self-regulated 

degradation for bone tissue engineering applications [1, 2]. Additional studies [3] investigated 

the influence of a CaP biomimetic coating on the osteogenic differentiation of rat bone 

marrow stromal cells (MSCs) and showed enhanced differentiation of rat MSCs seeded on 

the CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds with lysozyme incorporated to aid degradation. 

When compared with cells seeded onto control (uncoated) scaffolds, cells seeded onto CaP 

coated chitosan-based scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme demonstrated at all culture 

times greater osteogenic differentiation, bone matrix production and mineralization as 

demonstrated by calcium deposition measurements [3]. 

This approach is based on the use of a material that exhibits both self-regulated 

degradation and gradual in situ pore formation ability [1, 2]. It has been demonstrated that 

lysozyme, an enzyme ubiquitous in the human body [4, 5], degrades chitosan in vitro and in 

vivo [6, 7]. Lysozyme can attack cell wall polysaccharides of different bacterial species, 

especially Gram positive species, leading to rupture of the cell wall and subsequent death of 

the microorganism [8, 9]. The anti-inflammatory action of lysozyme is based on the 

neutralization of acidic substances released in the inflammatory process [10]. Previously, 

using a biomimetic technique, the surface of the scaffolds was coated with a calcium 

phosphate with a composition similar to the major inorganic component of bone, 

hydroxyapatite (HA) [2, 3, 11]. The main advantage of the biomimetic method [12-14] is the 

use of physiological conditions (pH 7.4 at 37ºC) that simulate the manner that apatite is 

formed in bone [15]. Moreover, this technique allows the incorporation of proteins and 

bioactive agents into CaP coatings without compromising their activity [2, 16, 17]. Chitosan 

and starch by themselves or in combination do not have adequate bone bonding, 

osteoconductive or osteoinductive properties for bone tissue engineering applications, and 

CaP coating may give raise to such key properties. 

The incorporation of lysozyme into CaP coatings prepared at the surface of chitosan-

based scaffolds using a biomimetic methodology was employed to control and tailor the 

scaffolds’ degradation rate and subsequent formation of pores [2, 3, 11]. In vitro, these 

scaffolds gradually exhibit in situ pore formation [2]. Based on previous work [1, 2], it is 

hypothesized that following implantation of the scaffold, an acute inflammatory response will 

occur with a subsequent pH decrease, and neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages 

will be recruited. Different enzymes, such as lysozyme, and other reactive species will be

191 

released in high levels from these cells, inducing degradation of the scaffolds in situ with 

subsequent pore formation. To prove the concept of in situ pore formation in vitro, previous 

studies simulating the inflammatory response were performed, and the formation of pores 

was clearly visible when CaP chitosan scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme were used [2]. 

Highly porous structures were formed as a function of degradation time, with pore diameters 

ranging from 50-300 ?m, suggesting that the pores were fully interconnected [2]. This size of 

pores greater than 150 ?m encourages the ingrowth of mineralized bone [18]. 

The combination of chitosan with other biodegradable materials has already shown to 

be effective for bone-related applications [19-21]. 

The inclusion of starch in chitosan matrices constitutes an interesting approach 

towards obtain scaffolds with enhanced degradation rates since starch is acting as a sacrifice 

material [1]. Furthermore, starch is enzymatically hydrolysed by ?-amylase, an enzyme 

present in blood serum. Starch is a natural polymer that presents excellent characteristics for 

biomaterials applications, such as low toxicity [22, 23]. Several in vitro and in vivo studies 

have shown that scaffolds produced from starch-based biomaterials are biocompatible in 

specific applications [24-26] and biodegradable in different conditions [1, 3, 27, 28].  

In order to prove the concept of in situ pore formation within chitosan-based scaffolds 

in vivo, a rat subcutaneous implantation model was employed. It was hypothesized that using 

this innovative methodology, the scaffolds, which at the time of implantation exhibit very 

promising mechanical properties due to the absence of macroporosity [1], will exhibit in situ 

pore formation facilitated by enzymes present in the body (namely the ?-amylase and 

lysozyme). This study was designed to investigate the following specific aims: (i) assess the 

degradation of the scaffolds in vivo, (ii) characterize the in situ formation of pores, and (iii) 

assess in vivo the concept of in situ pore-formation. 

 

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

2.1. Materials 

Degradable scaffolds based on chitosan and corn starch were used. Two different 

compositions were prepared using a precipitation method: chitosan (CH) and chitosan/starch 

scaffolds (CS) [1]. Briefly, chitosan was dissolved in 1% (v/v) acetic acid to obtain a 5% (w/v) 

solution. Then, using the same procedure, another formulation was prepared with the 

following ratio: 60/40 chitosan/starch. The chitosan and chitosan/starch solutions were cast

for Bone Tissue Engineering 

192 

into moulds and frozen (-20 ºC) overnight [1]. They were then immersed in a precipitation 

solution (25% (v) NaOH 1M and 75% (v) Na2SO4 0.5M) [1, 29] and washed several times 

with distilled water. After this procedure, four other formulations were prepared based on 

previously used biomimetic coating techniques [2, 3, 11] consisting of an impregnation of the 

materials with bioactive glass called Bioglass? (45S5; NOVABONE Alachua, Florida, USA) 

followed by an immersion in a 1? simulated body fluid (SBF, 37ºC, pH 7.4), which has ionic 

concentrations similar to those of the human blood plasma. Briefly, chitosan (CH) and 

chitosan/starch (CS) scaffolds were immersed in a wet bed of bioglass for 6 hours on an 

orbital rotator. After that, the scaffolds where immersed in 1? SBF with and without lysozyme 

(1 g/L) for 7 days at 37ºC (nucleation stage). This stage allows for the formation of CaP 

nuclei. After the nucleation stage, all samples were washed with distilled water and 

immersed in 1.5? SBF for 7 days at 37ºC in order to enhance CaP nuclei growth (growth 

stage). Four different samples were obtained using the biomimetic coating technique: CaP 

chitosan scaffolds (CaPCH), CaP chitosan/starch scaffolds (CaPCS), CaP chitosan scaffolds 

with incorporated lysozyme (CaPCH + lysozyme) and CaP chitosan/starch scaffolds with 

incorporated lysozyme (CaPCS + lysozyme) [2, 3, 11]. All chemical reagents were purchased 

from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise specified. 

 

2.2. Implant preparation 

In this study 5 mm diameter and approximately 1.5 mm thick scaffolds were used. All 

scaffolds were sterilized with ethylene oxide gas for 14 h prior to implantationin conditions 

described elsewhere [30, 31]. One day before subcutaneous implantation surgery, the 

implants were prewetted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution in 24-well plates 

overnight under sterile conditions.  

 

2.3. Subcutaneous implantation 

All animal manipulations were approved by Rice University’s Institutional Animal Care 

and Use Committee. Twenty four male Wistar rats 41-44 days old (Charles River 

Laboratories, USA) were used for subcutaneous implantation of acellular scaffolds. Three 

implantation periods were used: 3, 6 and 12 weeks. Anesthesia was induced with a 4% 

isoflurane/oxygen mixture, and maintained with 2% isoflurane during surgical manipulation. 

The rats were monitored to ensure that an appropriate surgical plane of anesthesia was 

maintained. The fur on the dorsum of the rat was clipped closely prior to surgery. Then, the

193 

animals were placed in a ventral position, the clipped dorsum was disinfected with povidone-

iodine and six small longitudinal incisions were made as described in Figure 1. A pocket was 

bluntly dissected at each incision, and one scaffold was placed in each pocket. One implant 

from each experimental group was implanted in twenty four rats (six implants per rat). A total 

of 8 scaffolds per experimental group per time point were implanted. Previous studies 

reported successful implantation of 6 materials in rat dorsal subcutaneous pockets using 

Wistar rats of similar or lower size [32-35]. The incisions were closed with simple interrupted 

5-0 Vicryl sutures. Each animal received an intraperitoneal injection of sterile saline to aid 

post-operative recovery (1 ml/100 g/hour of anesthesia) and a subcutaneous injection of 

buprenorphine (0.025 mg/kg) both before and 8-12 hours after surgery for analgesia. On the 

following day, two additional doses of subcutaneous buprenorphine (0.025 mg/kg) were 

injected for continued post-operative analgesia (i.e., at 20-24 and 32-36 hours post-op). Care 

was taken to give all subcutaneous injections caudal to the implantation sites. Animals were 

housed individually with water and food given ad libitum. At each time point, animals were 

anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation and euthanized with carbon dioxide asphyxiation. The 

implants were retrieved after a bilateral thoracotomy was performed to ensure death. 

 

2.4. Preparation of samples for weight loss and micro-computed tomography (?-CT) 

analysis 

After each implantation time, three scaffolds from each group were decellularized 

prior to weight loss measurement and micro-computed tomography analysis. Briefly, the 

scaffolds were immersed in double-distilled water (ddH2O) and placed in a 24-well plate at -

20 ºC. After that, scaffolds underwent three freeze/thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen and in a 37 

ºC water bath, respectively, to disrupt attached cells and remove cellular debris [36]. After 

this process scaffolds were air-dried in a laminar flow hood.

2.5. Weight loss measurements 

All samples were weighed before subcutaneous implantation (initial weight). After 3, 6 

and 12 weeks of implantation three decellularized samples of each condition were dried and 

weighed to determine the final weight and calculate the weight loss (1).

2.6. Micro-computed tomography (?-CT) analysis 

Retrieved implants used for weight loss measurements were also used for ?-CT 

analysis. Three samples from each group were used as controls (i.e., non-implanted 

specimens). µ-CT was carried out with a high-resolution µ-CT scanner (Skyscan 1072, 

Skyscan, Kontich, Belgium) using a pixel size of 5.27 ?m and integration time of 1.7 ms. The 

X-ray source was set at 70 keV of energy and 142 ?A of current. Approximately 400

195 

projections were acquired over a rotation range of 180° with a rotation step of 0.45°. Data 

sets were reconstructed using standardized cone-beam reconstruction software (NRecon 

v1.4.3, SkyScan). The output format for each sample was 400 serial 1024x1024 bitmap 

images. Representative data sets were segmented into binary images using a dynamic 

threshold of 40-255 for polymer and 130-255 for CaP coating (grey values). These 

representative data sets were used for morphometric 3D analysis (CT Analyser, v1.5.1.5, 

SkyScan) and to build 3D models (ANT 3D creator, v2.4, SkyScan). The morphometric 

analysis included porosity and pore interconnectivity. 3D virtual models of representative 

regions in the bulk of the scaffolds were created, visualized and registered using image 

processing software (CT Analyser and ANT 3D creator). 

 

2.7. Histology 

After euthanasia, the implants were retrieved along with the surrounding tissue and 

processed for histology. Five specimens from each group per time point were fixed in 10% 

neutral buffered formalin and then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, immersed in 

infiltration solutions, embedded in Technovit glycol methacrylate (kit 8100, Heraeus Kulzer, 

EBSciences, CO, USA) and subsequently polymerized. Three specimens from each group 

per time period were cut to obtain longitudinal sections and two specimens were cut to obtain 

transverse sections of 7 ?m thickness using a modified microtome equipped with a tungsten 

blade (Leica RM 2155). 

Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) to evaluate the in vivo 

degradation, pore formation and cellular infiltration through the implants. For visualization of 

the CaP coating, additional sections were exposed to 5% silver nitrate solution under UV for 

25 min and counterstained with 0.5% safranin O solution. All images were obtained using an 

Olympus BX61 Motorized System Microscope and attached video camera (Olympus DP70). 

Histological sections from all time points were scored by the authors (AMM, ARP and CMA) 

blinded for group conditions and implantation time, and consensus was reached on the final 

score. The cellular ingrowth within the implants and the degradation of each sample was 

qualitatively scored based on dissolution, cracks, and fragmentation on a scale modified from 

De Jong, as shown in Table 1 [37].

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1. Weight loss measurements 

Lysozyme, an enzyme ubiquitous in the human body [5, 38], has been reported to be 

responsible for the in vivo degradation of chitosan [6, 39]. As observed in Figure 2, all groups 

degraded gradually as a function of implantation time. Statistically significant weight loss (p &amp;lt;

0.05) was observed for chitosan/starch scaffolds with and without CaP coating and both in 

the presence and in absence of lysozyme after 12 weeks of implantation. The highest weight 

loss after 12 weeks was 29.8 ± 1.5% for CaP chitosan/starch scaffolds with lysozyme 

incorporated (Figure 2). It is expected that for longer implantation times, the degradation and 

the in situ formation of pores will be greater that the obtained in the herein presented studies 

performed up to 12 weeks. Comparing all groups at the same time point, chitosan scaffolds 

had the lowest weight loss overall, but this was, as expected, slightly increased when 

lysozyme was present. Chitosan/starch scaffolds with and without CaP and in the presence 

or absence of lyzozyme demonstrated significantly greater weight loss than chitosan 

scaffolds for all time points (Figure 2).  

Previous studies investigated the degradation of chitosan scaffolds with and without 

CaP coating and in the presence and absence of lysozyme at pH 5 to simulate the 

inflammatory response [2]. The weight loss in vitro was not as pronounced as that observed 

in vivo. Similar to the in vivo experiments described herein, in vitro CaP coated chitosan 

scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme had the highest weight loss [2]. However, the complete 

dissolution of the CaP coatings was not observed in vivo, although it was in vitro at pH 5, 

possibly indicating that the inflammatory response following implantation in vivo does not 

achieve such a low pH or does not sustain this low pH for as long as the previously 

performed in vitro study [2]. 

This study also examined the effect of the addition of starch into the chitosan phase 

compared with chitosan scaffolds alone. The presence of starch in addition to chitosan 

seems to accelerate the degradation of scaffolds compared to that of chitosan alone (Figure 

2). Starch is degraded by ?-amylase, an enzyme also present in the human body namely in 

the human blood [40]. Starch granules with 5-10 µm dimensions were homogeneously 

distributed throughout the chitosan matrix enhancing hydrolysis by enzymes existing in vivo, 

namely lysozyme and ?-amylase [1]. The pore size and distribution in the scaffold are 

controlled by the location of the “sacrifice” phase (starch), the degradation of which increases 

the microporosity by the release of starch granules (small dots visible at high magnifications

3.2. ?-CT analysis 

The ?-CT analysis performed on all experimental groups showed an increase in 

scaffold porosity as a function of implantation time (Figure 3). After 3 weeks post-

implantation, degradation was observed in 3D images for chitosan-based formulations 

compared with controls (Figure 3). After 6 weeks, results indicated increased degradation for 

all the materials. The trend towards an accelerated increase in porosity/degradation was 

observed for all conditions up to week 12. Nevertheless, analysis of the 3D images did not 

indicate a remarkable effect for the presence of lysozyme in chitosan scaffolds, but there did 

appear to be enhanced degradation after 6 and 12 weeks when lysozyme was incorporated 

in CaP chitosan/starch scaffolds (Figure 3). Furthermore, the CaP coating (dark grey) was 

observed in 3D images at all time points for CaP coated scaffolds, indicating the 

aforementioned lack of coating degradation as was seen in vitro  (Figure 3).

According to Figure 4A no significant differences in porosity were found between 

groups at the same time point with the exception of CaP chitosan/starch scaffolds with 

incorporated lysozyme after 6 weeks of implantation. This condition (CaPCS + lysozyme) 

presented significant higher porosity (p&lt;0.05) compared with chitosan/starch scaffolds (CS) 

(43% ± 7 and 27% ± 4, respectively). Lysozyme seems to positively enhance porosity after 6 

weeks of implantation, corroborating the weight loss results (Figure 2). After 3 weeks, no 

significant differences were found for all studied groups when compared with the porosity of 

the control (non-implanted) samples. However, after 6 weeks of implantation, porosity 

significantly increased for chitosan (CH), chitosan/starch (CS) and CaP chitosan/starch 

scaffolds with incorporated lysozyme (CaPCS + lysozyme) (Figure 4A). The same trend was 

observed after 12 weeks of implantation, showing significantly higher porosity for all scaffolds 

compared to that of control samples. These results indicate that all groups have the ability to 

form pores in situ as a function of implantation time. All groups presented a significantly 

increasing porosity over time ranging at least from 22% (chitosan/starch scaffolds with an 

initial porosity of 10 ± 8% increased after 12 weeks to 32 ± 10%)  up to 32% observed for 

CaPCS+lysozyme with 9 ± 5% prosity before implantation and 43 ± 7% after 6 weeks.  The 

degradation and consequently the porosity is expected to be greater for longer implantation 

times. Furthermore, results suggested that lysozyme positively affected pore formation by 

enhancing porosity in the case of chitosan/starch scaffolds.  

The interconnectivity of chitosan (CH) scaffolds significantly increased with increased 

implantation time when compared to the interconnectivity of control samples (Figure 4B). No 

significant differences in interconnectivity were observed between groups at the same time 

point. After 12 weeks all groups demonstrated an increase in interconnectivity with the 

exception of chitosan/starch scaffolds and CaPCS + lysozyme. Lysozyme seems to have no 

effect on interconnectivity; however, interconnectivity increased for all groups over time with 

a range of values from 24-31% and 43-79%, before and after 12 weeks implantation, 

respectively.

3.3. Microscopic analysis 

At retrieval of the implants, no macroscopic signs of infection were seen at the 

surgical sites (Figure 1C). Furthermore, no adverse tissue reactions (toxic effects) were 

observed with light microscopy. Specimens for microscopy were retrieved at 3, 6 and 12 

weeks post-implantation. Polymer and CaP coating degradation and cellular ingrowth within 

the implants were assessed using histological techniques. Remaining scaffolds were easily 

identified after H&amp;amp;E staining, as chitosan and chitosan/starch stained red, and cells stained 

blue and pink. In Figure 5, CaP coatings are not easily identified (appear in dark blue/black) 

but in order to specifically stain calcium, several sections were stained with von Kossa 

(Figure 7). For all scaffold formulations, even at the earliest implantation time, the formation 

of pores and the infiltration of cells throughout the scaffolds (clearly visible at high 

magnifications) were evident (Figure 5). Degradation of scaffolds within the initially almost 

non-porous network of chitosan or chitosan/starch is evident through the presence of circular 

or irregular structures (pores) filled with cells (Figure 5). Furthermore, as a function of 

implantation time, scaffolds have changed their shape and size, meaning that the scaffolds 

have been degraded and subsequently resorbed (Figure 5). The infiltration of cells as a 

function of time is clearly visible (Figure 6A), and occurred mainly when lysozyme was 

present. The progression of in vivo degradation was also evident by the formation of pores 

(Figure 5). The increased scoring of degradation, especially when lysozyme was present, 

corroborated these data (Figure 6B). The degradation of scaffolds did not elicit a severe 

inflammatory response. For the success of a bone tissue engineering implant, the scaffold 

must have a rate of degradation that corresponds to the rate of new bone ingrowth. This 

strategy seems to be very useful since the ideal scaffold should have appropriate mechanical 

properties for the site of implantation. It was previously demonstrated that in both dry and wet 

states these CaP coated chitosan scaffolds have appropriate mechanical properties for bone 

applications [1].

During resorption, the degradation products of CaP coatings (calcium and phosphate 

ions) are naturally metabolized and do not induce abnormal calcium and phosphate levels in 

urine, serum, or organs [41, 42]. The dissolution of CaP coatings depends on the particle 

size, crystallographic features, density and the nature of the solution used to make the

205 

coating (composition, pH and temperature) [42, 43]. Highly soluble and poorly crystalline 

coatings might accelerate the dissolution process and consecutively favor osteoconduction 

[44]. These CaP coatings are partially amorphous and quite stable at pH 7.4 [2]. Figure 7 

shows von Kossa stained sections with CaP coating that remained on or within the implants. 

The material is stained in grey, cells in pink and CaP coating in black. All sections, with the 

exception of the controls (without CaP coatings), have black regions around or within the 

implants, meaning that the CaP coating did not dissolve completely. Signs of degradation of 

CaP coating were evident in Figure 7 but some CaP coating remained on the implants. 

These results are corroborated by 3D images obtained with ?-CT (Figure 3). Complete loss 

of the coatings was not observed (Figure 7), as illustrated in 3D images obtained by ?-CT 

(Figure 3). Furthermore, we can state that in vivo the pH did not seem to decrease to 5 

because these biomimetic CaP coatings are soluble at pH 5 or below as it was demonstrated 

previously [2]. Or, perhaps the pH did drop below 5 but not for a sufficiently long period of 

time to dissolve the coatings. Von Kossa stained sections also support the H&amp;amp;E results and 

histological scoring showing pronounced implant degradation as a function of implantation 

time and infiltration of cells throughout the implants (Figures 6 and 7).

4. CONCLUSIONS 

In vivo degradation of all specimens was clearly demonstrated by weight loss 

measurements, porosity increase, and images of H&amp;amp;E stained sections where there were 

visible pores completely filled with cells. Porosity significantly increased after 12 weeks of 

implantation, ranging from 22% up to 32% for all conditions. This strategy, using 

biodegradable naturally occurring polymers such as chitosan and starch, seems to maintain 

structural support throughout the implantation period tested, with the formation of pores in 

situ allowing for the penetration of cells into the implants. The gradual in situ pore forming 

ability of chitosan-based scaffolds was clearly demonstrated in vivo. Furthermore, this 

approach is very promising since incorporated lysozyme has antibacterial properties and 

CaP coated chitosan-based scaffolds can simultaneously exhibit osteoconductive properties. 

While further in vivo characterization within an orthotopic site is needed, these findings 

indicate that in situ pore-forming CaP coated chitosan-based materials have potential for 

future use in bone tissue engineering applications.

CHAPTER IX 

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND FINAL REMARKS 

The main aims of the developed studies reported in this thesis were the successful 

use of natural based scaffolds by means of applying two main bone tissue engineering 

strategies. The experimental work presented in this thesis is divided in two main parts: 1) 

The first strategy involves the culture of cells onto natural-based scaffolds with osteogenic 

media supplemented with several enzymes that mimic the physiological concentrations, 

under static cultures and flow perfusion conditions (Section 3); 2) The second strategy 

describes the development and applications of naturally derived scaffolds, based on chitosan 

and starch, and validation of in situ pore forming concept in vitro and in vivo  (Section 4).   

 

In the first part of this thesis (Section 3), we have used SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds known 

to be degraded by enzymes present in the human blood serum, namely ?-amylase and 

lipase. Culture of rat marrow stromal cells (MSCs) on flow perfusion conditions enhances 

differentiation of marrow stromal cells with subsequent formation of a bone-like extracellular 

matrix. This work intended to mimic the in vitro and in vivo degradation of the starch/poly(?-

caprolactone) (SPCL) fiber meshes using enzymes responsible for their degradation at the 

same concentrations as those found in human serum. Besides characterizing the 

susceptibility of SPCL fiber meshes to enzymatic degradation, this study aimed also to 

investigate the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and subsequent formation of extracellular 

matrix (ECM) under static and flow perfusion conditions in the presence of hydrolytic 

enzymes (lipase and/or ?-amylase). The degradation studies performed in static and 

dynamic conditions demonstrated the effect of lipase and ?-amylase on degradation of SPCL 

fiber mesh scaffolds, showing that after 30 days these enzymes did not have a negative 

effect on SPCL fiber integrity. Lipase had a positive effect on the porosity and size of pores 

when dynamic conditions were used. Porosity and pore size were also enhanced by ?-

amylase. When SPCL fiber meshes were cultured with osteogenic media supplemented with 

several enzymes in static and flow perfusion conditions, the following was concluded: 

- culture media supplemented with ?-amylase or lipase revealed that these enzymes 

promoted the proliferation MSCs on SPCL when cultured under static conditions 

- cuture media supplemented with lipase and with both ?-amylase and lipase enzymes 

enhanced the proliferation MSCs when cultured on SPCL on flow perfusion 

bioreactors 



CHAPTER IX. General Conclusions and Final Remarks 

 

218 

- lipase had a superior effect in the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and on the 

mineralization of the extracellular matrix when added to osteogenic culture medium 

as compared with the results obtained without enzymes or with ?-amylase or both 

enzymes together under static and flow perfusion conditions. 

- flow perfusion culture dramatically improved the distribution of ECM through the 

cultured scaffolds and mineralized matrix production. 

These results demonstrated that supplementation of culture media with lipase holds great 

potential for the generation of bone tissue engineering constructs from MSCs seeded onto 

SPCL fiber mesh scaffolds under static or flow perfusion conditions. Lipase enhanced the 

osteoblastic differentiation of the seeded MSCs and promoted matrix mineralization without 

deleteriously affecting the structural integrity of the meshes over 16 days of culture. 

 

In Section 4, the second part of experimental results of this thesis, we have proposed 

novel responsive scaffolds based on chitosan and starch with an in situ pore forming ability. 

The results of the compressive tests showed that these materials exhibited mechanical 

properties that fall in the normal ranges of strength and modulus for trabecular bone. 

Degradation studies using ?-amylase and lysozyme with similar concentrations to those 

found in human serum were selected in order to simulate the physiological conditions and 

subsequently assess pore formation. It was demonstrated that these scaffolds were 

susceptible to these enzymes and were able to degrade and to induce the formation of pores 

using enzymatic physiological concentrations. Biocompatibility studies showed that the 

extracts of the scaffolds were non cytotoxic.    

Since the formation of pores in the presence of lysozyme in conditions similar to those 

found in human blood serum was only moderate compared to those obtained with ?-amylase 

or with the two enzymes together (?-amylase and lysozyme), an alternative approach was 

selected to improve these results. The alternative was to incorporate lysozyme at high 

concentrations in CaP coatings prepared at the surface of these materials. Our hypothesis 

proposed that a biomimetic CaP coating would further enhance the in vivo performance of 

using a CaP coating since these materials, which per se are not osteoinductive and 

osteoconductive. Degradation studies at pH 7.4, to simulate normal physiological conditions, 

showed that in these conditions, CaP coatings are very stable as the materials remained 

covered with a CaP layer. At pH 5, to simulate an in vivo inflammatory response, a porous 

structure was formed when lysozyme was incorporated into the CaP coatings. The 

degradation effect of lysozyme on chitosan scaffolds at pH 5 was clearly visible by the 

appearance of pores.  



CHAPTER IX. General Conclusions and Final Remarks 

219 

Degradation studies performed with lysozyme using similar concentration to those 

incorporated into CaP coatings showed the formation of pores as a function of immersion 

time, indicating an increase of porosity from 5% to 55%. Lysozyme had a significant catalytic 

effect on chitosan scaffolds resulting in porous 3D structures with interconnected pores 

(~78%). On the basis of these studies it was concluded that CaP biomimetic coatings with 

incorporated lysozyme enhance osteogenic differentiation of rat marrow stromal cells. 

Therefore, the use of a CaP biomimetic coating strategy with incorporated lysozyme on the 

surface of chitosan-based scaffolds is able to provide an improved environment for rat MSCs 

differentiation along the osteogenic lineage when compared with uncoated scaffolds. 

Finally, to validate the in situ pore forming concept in vivo chitosan-based scaffolds with 

or without CaP coating and in the presence and absence of lysozyme, a rat subcutaneous 

model was used. In vivo degradation of all scaffolds was clearly demonstrated by weight loss 

measurements, porosity increase, and images of H&amp;amp;E stained sections where were visible 

pores completely filled out with cells. Porosity significantly increased after 12 weeks ranging 

from 22% up to 34%. It is expected that for longer implantation times, the degradation and 

the in situ formation of pores will be greater than the obtained in the herein presented studies 

performed up to 12 weeks. These findings indicate the potential that CaP coated chitosan-

based materials can have in bone tissue engineering applications and further motivates 

future in vivo studies using an orthotopic model. 

 

As final remarks, it can be stated that the work developed and included in this thesis 

provided interesting results on different types of natural based scaffolds and targeted two 

different bone tissue engineering strategies. In the first strategy we tried to simulate 

physiologic enzymatic conditions, since the ideal scaffold for bone tissue engineering should 

be biodegradable and bioresorbable while being able to support the growth of new bone. 

Static culture conditions and flow perfusion bioreactor cultures were successfully used in 

combination with enzymes such as ?-amylase and/or lipase on the osteogenic differentiation 

of rat bone marrow stromal cells. 

Lastly, we have proposed the use of a self-regulating degrading material with gradual in 

situ pore formation ability in vitro and in vivo. The success of this approach is mainly dictated 

by the presence of lysozyme incorporated into the coatings that will grant chitosan scaffolds 

with a gradual in vivo pore forming ability and antibacterial activity, while the presence of the 

CaP coating can simultaneously enable osteoconductive properties to the scaffolds. The 

demonstrated ability of these novel surface coated scaffolds to form an interconnected pore 

structure in situ coupled with their positive effect on the osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs

and mineralized matrix production clearly illustrate the strong potential of these scaffolds for 

application in bone tissue engineering strategies. These “smart” and responsive scaffolds, 

with in situ pore forming capability and interesting mechanical properties, seem to be 

advantageous when compared with other presently available conventional materials.
