ABSTRACT. This study represents one of the first contributions to the knowledge on the quantitative fidelity of the Recent freshwater
molluscan assemblages in subtropical rivers. Thanatocoenoses and biocoenoses were studied in straight and meandering to braided sectors,
in the middle course of the Touro Passo River, a fourth-order tributary of the Uruguay River, located in the westernmost part of the State
of Rio Grande do Sul. Samplings were carried out through quadrats of 5 m2, five in each sector. A total area of 50 m2 was sampled. Samplings
were also made in a lentic environment (abandoned meander), with intermittent communication with the Touro Passo River, aiming to
record out-of-habitat shell transportation from the lentic communities to the main river channel. The results show that, despite the
frequent oscillation of the water level, the biocoenosis of the Touro Passo River shows high ecological fidelity and undergoes little
influence from the lentic vicinal environments. The taxonomic composition and some features of the structure of communities,
especially the dominant species, also reflect some ecological differences between the two main sectors sampled, such as the complexity
of habitats in the meandering-sector. Regarding the quantitative fidelity, 60% of the species found alive were also found dead and 47.3%
of the species found dead were also found alive, at river-scale. However, 72% of the dead individuals belong to species also found alive.
This value might be related with the good rank order correlation obtained for live/dead assemblages. Consequently, the dominant species
of the thanatocoenoses could be used to infer the ecological attributes of the biocoenoses. The values of all the indexes analyzed were
very variable in small-scale samplings (quadrat), but were more similar to others registered in previous studies, when they were analyzed
in a station and river scale.

KEYWORDS. Freshwater mollusks, taphonomy, death assemblages, life assemblages.

RESUMO. Fidelidade quantitativa de associações de moluscos límnicos recentes na bacia do rio Touro Passo, Rio Grande
do Sul, Brasil. O presente estudo teve como objetivo apresentar uma das primeiras contribuições ao conhecimento sobre a fidelidade
quantitativa de associações de moluscos recentes em rios subtropicais. Tanatocenoses e biocenoses foram estudadas em seções retilínea e
meandrante tendendo a anastomosada, no curso médio do rio Touro Passo, um tributário de 4ª ordem do rio Uruguai, localizado no
extremo oeste do Rio Grande do Sul. As amostragens foram realizadas por meio de quadrats de 5 m

2
, cinco em cada seção, amostrando-

se um total de 50 m?. Também foram feitas amostragens em um ambiente lêntico, com comunicação intermitente com o Touro Passo,
objetivando detectar a existência de transporte de comunidades lênticas para o interior do rio. Os resultados obtidos mostram que, apesar
da freqüente oscilação do nível da água, a biocenose do Touro Passo apresenta uma alta fidelidade ecológica e sofre pouca influência de
espécies de ambientes lênticos. A composição taxonômica e características de estrutura de comunidades, especialmente as espécies
dominantes, refletem, ainda, diferenças ecológicas relacionadas às duas seções amostradas, como a maior complexidade de habitats da
estação meandrante. Quanto à fidelidade quantitativa, 60% das espécies encontradas vivas também foram encontradas mortas e 47,3%
das espécies encontradas mortas também foram encontras vivas em escala de rio. Porém, 72% dos exemplares coletados mortos são
representantes de espécies encontradas vivas. Essa percentagem alta pode estar relacionada à boa correlação entre o ranking de
dominância das associações vivas e mortas e, conseqüentemente, as espécies dominantes das tanatocenoses podem ser utilizadas para
inferir características ecológicas das biocenoses. Todos os índices analisados variaram muito em escala local (quadrat) e seus valores são
mais aproximados aos de outros, registrados em estudos prévios, apenas quando analisados em escala mais ampla (seção, área total).

PALAVRAS-CHAVE. Moluscos límnicos, tafonomia, associações mortas, associações vivas.

According to BEHRENSMEYER et al. (2000), the
quantitative fidelity is “ ... the quantitative faithfulness of
the record of morphs, age classes, species richness,
species abundance, trophic structure, etc. to the original
biological signal”. In other words, it is the degree of the
similarity between the life assemblage and the potential
death assemblage. This “ degree of similarity” is governed
by an interaction of multiple extrinsic/intrinsic factors,
such as (a) the source and rate of shell supply, (b) the
vulnerability of skeletal hard parts to post-mortem
destruction or modification, and (c) the taphonomic
conditions that the bioclasts are exposed in the
environment of depositon (KIDWELL &amp;amp; BOSENCE, 1991).
Time-averaging (or temporal-mixing) is another important
issue affecting the fidelity of death assemblages (WALKER

&amp;amp; BAMBACH, 1971). This phenomenon promotes the mixing
of multiple non contemporaneous generations of shelly
organisms and/or communities. Time-averaged death
assemblages can be a product of multiple processes,
including (a) the out-of-habitat transport of skeletal
remains by storm-induced flows and currents, (b) extensive
reworking by waves and currents, (c) intrastratal
biological activity, (d) selective destruction of species
and/or preferable size-classes, and (e) sea-level
fluctuations and rates of sedimentation (CUMMINS, 1994;
KIDWELL &amp;amp; FLESSA, 1995; BEHRENSMEYER et al., 2000;
KOWALEWSKI et al., 2003).

The vast majority of the studies on compositional
fidelity has been conducted in shallow water marine to
transitional settings, including estuaries, lagoons, bays

and continental shelves. These focus primarily on
mollusks, especially bivalves (KIDWELL &amp;amp; BOSENCE, 1991;
CUMMINS, 1994; KIDWELL &amp;amp; FLESSA, 1995; BEHRENSMEYER
et al., 2000; KOWALEWSKI et al., 2003). Hence, as
highlighted by KOWALEWSKI et al. (2003), our view of this
issue is biased toward specific taxonomic groups
(bivalvocentric) and environments, lacking data for
several shelly groups both from marine and continental
environments. In spite of that, the data available shown
that the live/dead agreement is high (KIDWELL &amp;amp; BOSENCE,
1991; KIDWELL &amp;amp; FLESSA, 1995) for the marine molluscan
assemblages, but the dead/live agreement is variable
(high, KOWALEWSKI et al., 2003 or low, KIDWELL &amp;amp; BOSENCE,
1991; KIDWELL &amp;amp; FLESSA, 1995). Results may vary,
however, according to the spatial scale employed in the
analysis (CUMMNIS, 1994; KIDWELL &amp;amp; FLESSA, 1995;
KOWALEWSKI et al., 2003). For example, low dead/live
agreement is generally shown by assemblages
representing limited sampling strategies and
encompassing small-scale coverage. Normally, the
commonest species with preservable hardparts are the
one better represented in the death assemblages,
showing good fidelity to the original life assemblages
(KIDWELL &amp;amp; FLESSA, 1995; KIDWELL, 2001).

Despite its importance providing essential
paleoecological and paleoclimatological information,
shelly assemblages from freshwater systems have
received far less attention in taphonomic studies than
the marine ones. The limited fidelity data available for
molluscan assemblages of this system have shown that
the live/dead agreement can be high (CUMMINS, 1994) or
low (PIP, 1988). However, these studies are also limited in
terms of facies coverage, focusing primarily on lentic
settings (PIP, 1988; COHEN, 1989; CUMMINS, 1994). Here
again the taphonomic knowledge is biased toward some
facies or subenvironments. For typical lotic fluvial
environments, where the currents can be an important
agent of post-mortem out-of-habitat transportation of
shells, only a few studies provided scarse, but important
data (e.g., BRIGGS et al., 1990; WARREN, 1991; CUMMINS,
1994). These studies suggest that the different types of
the molluscan life and death assemblages tend to
accumulate in distinct depositional settings (e.g., channel,
flood plains, oxbow lakes) and are influenced by several
biotic and abiotic agents (see PIP, 1988, for a revision).

The Touro Passo River, a tributary of the Uruguay
River basin, in the west of the State of Rio Grande do Sul,
Brazil, provides a good opportunity for accessing the
quantitative fidelity of fluvial molluscan shelly
assemblages. According to Édson Oliveira (pers. comm.),
at least three families and six genera of bivalve mollusks
are thriving in the river nowadays. Because the low depth
of the channel (~6 m) and the dry seasons, these shells
can be easily collected. In addition, several information
on the biology and ecology of the southern Brazilian
freshwater mollusks are available in the literature (e.g.
VEITENHEIMER &amp;amp; MANSUR, 1978; SILVA &amp;amp; THOMÉ, 1981;
LOPES-PITONI et al., 1984; LANZER &amp;amp; VEITENHEIMER-
MENDES, 1985; MANSUR &amp;amp; GARCES, 1988; MANSUR et al.,
1987, 1988, 1991, 1994, 2001, 2003b; PEREIRA et al. 2000a,b,
2001; VEITENHEIMER-MENDES et al., 1990, 1992; LANZER,
1991, 1996; OLIVEIRA &amp;amp; MANSUR, 2001; FOCHT &amp;amp;

VEITENHEIMER-MENDES, 2001), complemented by studies
in adjacent areas of the Uruguay and Argentina (see
revision in MARTINEZ &amp;amp; ROJAS, 2004). Finally, the presence
of Cenozoic Touro Passo Formation outcrops along the
river’s margin, including mollusk-dominated assemblages
of Pleistocene/Holocene ages (BOMBIN, 1976; OLIVEIRA &amp;amp;
MILDER, 1990), can offer valuable data for future
comparisons with the fidelity data presented here.

In the context above, the purpose of this
contribution is to analyze the quantitative fidelity of the
present-day molluscan assemblages that occur in distinct
fluvial environments of the Touro Passo River in order to
verify: (a) the ecological fidelity (sensu DAJOZ, 1978) of
the biocoenoses; (b) the paleoecological fidelity by
means of live/dead and dead/live comparisons among
the biocoenoses and thanatocoenoses found in channels
with distinct morphologies and bottom types; and (c)
the percentage of dead individuals from species found
alive.

MATERIAL  AND  METHODS

The Touro Passo River is a tributary of the left
margin of the Uruguay River basin, located in Uruguaiana
County, State of Rio Grande do Sul (Fig. 1). Its springs
are located 140 meters above sea-level, changing to 60 m
in the mid course and to 40 m in the river’s mouth (BOMBIN,
1976). Floodings are frequent and are, in part, caused by
floods of the Uruguay River or are a consequence of
torrential rains. Also, these may be caused by the low
capacity of the hydrological system, with the river
overruning all the flood plains (BOMBIN, 1976).

The course of the Touro Passo River shows a varied
of morphologies, including straight and meandering to
braided sectors. Hence, the river includes several fluvial
subenvironments, supporting different types of
freshwater communities. The channels have a great range
of depth and their margins are covered by riparian
vegetation (BOMBIN, 1976). Sandy bottoms predominate,
and aquatic plants are rare (Tab. I).

In the studied sectors, the Touro Passo River is a
forth-order river (see STRAHLER &amp;amp; STRAHLER, 1989), which
supposedly favour the deposition of great amount of
live materials and dead skeletal remains (see
CHRISTOFOLETTI, 1980).

The climate of the region is subtropical, type Cfa
II2a (Köppen’s classification, MORENO, 1961). The mean
annual precipitation value is 1350 mm, with rains equally
distributed during the year. The mean annual temperature
is 19°C (maximum averages of 26°C, in January, and
minimum averages of 12ºC, in July), with the humidity
reaching 70% (SARTORI, 2003).

The area is represented by the grasslands (locally
named Campanha), with stony fields and shallow soils
(PORTO, 2002). The vegetation includes deciduous woody,
generally thorny, including arboreal/shrub species, as the
“ espinilho” [Acacia farnesiana (L.)] (Fabaceae), and wild
and succulent plants, showing grassy/herbaceous
coverings, typical of subtropical areas (BOMBIN, 1976;
LEITE, 2002; PORTO, 2002).

Samplings were carried out in two different river
sectors, with distinct channel morphologies: straight (SS)

and meandering-sectors (MS), both located in the mid-
course of the Touro Passo River (Fig. 1). We also sampled
a partially dammed channel. There an artificial dam was
built to supply water to local agricultural activities, during
the dry seasons. Thus, during the water-deficienty periods
the channel looses connection with the main river channel,
acting as an abandoned meander channel (AMS) (Fig. 1).

The collecting stations in the SS include two sites,
both with low sinuosity. Although sandy bottoms
predominate, fine-grained (muddy) compacted substrates
are also present (Édson Oliveira, pers. comm.). In some
sites, the margins show steep slope and the channel
reaches nearly 1.60 m of depth. The current velocities range
from moderate to strong with continuous flow (Tab. I).

The collecting station in the MS is located in the
meandering to braided sector of the river (BOMBIN, 1976)
(Fig. 1). Small and shallow channels, some with braided
pattern, occur in the alluvial island that separates the
main channel from the secondary one (Fig. 1). The island
is characterized by the presence of riparian vegetation,
offering little shadowing for the river’s margins. Physical
and hydrological properties of each channel are very
distinct (Tab. I).

Sampling in the MS included five substations for
each station (Fig. 1). The molluscan fauna of the AMS
was sampled to record possible out-of-habitat species
that were transported during floods. The vegetation of
the AMS is characterized by riparian coverage and by
the presence of the aquatic macrophyte Nymphoides
indica (L.) O. Kuntze (Menyanthaceae). The site is
characterized by low luminosity, less than 60 cm of depth,
and organic-rich bottoms.

The biocoenoses (life assemblages) and
thanatocoenoses (death assemblages) were sampled in
February (dry period) and May (flood period) of 2003, and
in April (dry period) of 2004. In the MS, samplings were
conducted only during the dry season. During the May
floodings the water level rises and associated with the strong
currents made impossible the sampling of the MS bottoms,
due to the steep margins of this sector. It is important to
emphasize that in the SS sector the oscilation of the water
level is smaller than in the MS, and the shells were captured
at the same sites during the flood and dry periods.

In each substation (SS 01 to 05 and MS 01 to 05),
the mollusks were collected using quadrats with sampling
area of 5 m2. This area is adequate to the low abundance
of freshwater mollusks, such as Unionacea (CUMMINS,
1994). Consequently, an area of 25 m

2
 was sampled for

each station. In the AMS, samplings included three
quadrats only.

The mollusks were collected with sieves (mesh of 1
mm) especially in the river’s margins, not overstepping 1
m of depth. In the AMS, the macrophytes were removed
and examined individually, and the mollusks were handly
collected. In the substation MS 02, adjacent to a
fossiliferous outcrop of the Touro Passo Formation, the
fossil mollusks, whenever identified, were removed of
the sampling.

Live-collected specimens were preserved in 80%
ethyl alcohol, and the dead ones stored in plastic bags.
The specimens (shell fragments included), were identified
to species level, whenever possible.

Taxonomic identification was conducted using the
extensive malacological literature available and with help

of specialists. The studied mollusks were deposited in
the “ Coleção de Invertebrados, Setor de Zoologia,
Departamento de Biologia, Universidade Federal de Santa
Maria (UFSM)”.

For each mollusk assemblage, analyses included
(a) the number (n) of individuals, (b) the relative frequency
(%), and (c) the numeric dominance (the numerically
dominant species in each site sampled).

To determine the number of bivalves in the death
assemblages, for each station, the disarticulated matching
valves (right/left) were considered as one individual.
According to KOWALEWSKI et al. (2003) “ although all valves
(including fragments) may represent unique individuals
when the sampling domain is large, some correction for
disarticulated elements still needs to be applied when
bivalved organisms are analyzed together with univalved
organisms. This is because univalved specimens are half
as likely to be sampled as bivalved organisms”.
Consequently, the number of disarticulated valves, with
no matching valves, was corrected by a factor of 0.5 (see
KOWALEWSKI et al., 2003 for this methodological procedure).
Because shell fragments were extremely rare, exhaustive
analyses were not employed (KOWALEWSKI et al., 2003).

Species diversity and richness were calculated for
the evaluation and comparison of diversity of each
studied station. The richness (S) was measured,
according to the number of different species in each
station. The diversity index applied was the Shannon-
Wiener (H’ = - ? p

i
 . log

e
 p

i
) index, where p

i
 is the

proportion of individuals found in the n species
(MAGURRAN, 1988).

The analysis of the ecological fidelity of the
biocoenoses (i.e., the intensity in which each species is
associated with the biocoenoses) followed the Dajoz’s
classification (DAJOZ, 1978). According to this, the
following species are present: (a) characteristic species
(eucoen) –  exclusively occurs in one biocoenosis or is
commonly abundant in certain associations; (b)
preferential species (tychocoen) –  occurs in several
biocoenoses, but showing preference for one of them;
(c) strange (xenoecic) –  accidentally occurs in the
biocoenoses and, (d) indifferent species –  indifferently
occurs in several biocoenoses.

The Sorensen index of similarity was used to
compare the species composition of the life and death
assemblages, in terms of the number of species present

and the number of species in common, according to the
formula: S = 2C/ (A + B) where S = index of similarity, A =
number of species in death assemblage, B = number of
species in life assemblages, and C = number of species
common to both life and death assemblage (ODUM, 1988).

The quantitative fidelity was analyzed considering
(see also KIDWELL &amp;amp; BOSENCE, 1991): (a) the live/dead
agreement or the percentage of shelly species found live
and also dead in a given site (N

S
 x 100/ N

dead/live agreement or the percentage of species found

L
) is the number of species found live only,

(N

) is the number of species found dead only and (N

S

the number of species found both live and dead.

The Spearman Rank correlation (rs) test was applied
to compare the ranking order of the most abundant
species of the life and death assemblages. Finally, all
analyses were performed at the station-level (sectors SS
and MS) and also pooling the data to the whole river
(site-scale or river-scale) (except the Shannon-Wiener
diversity index). The Mann-Whitney test was used to
analyze the differences between stations, using 5% of
significance (p &amp;lt;0.05).

RESULTS  AND  DISCUSSION

Biocoenoses. A total of 1,226 specimens belonging
to 12 mollusk (gastropod and bivalve) species were recorded
in the studied biocoenoses (Tab. II). The bivalves were
represented by 136 individuals, belonging to: Diplodon

(Guppy, 1867) and P. sterkianum Pilsbry, 1897 (Figs. 14,15).
The gastropods encompassed 1,090 specimens, attributed
to Pomacea canaliculata (Lamarck, 1801) (Fig. 4),
Potamolithus aff. orbigny Pilsbry, 1896 (Fig. 3), Potamolithus
sp. and Biomphalaria sp. (Fig. 5).

Pooling the data, the dominant species (%) in the
studied sectors of the Touro Passo River are the
gastropods Potamolithus aff. orbigny and Potamolithus
sp. (Tab. II). Among the bivalves, C. largillierti was the
dominant species. In the different river sectors, the
richness and the number of individuals were higher in
the MS biocoenoses, but this difference was not
significant (p=0.076). In the AMS site, the following
species and number of individuals were assigned:
Biomphalaria sp. (16.6%, n=42), Gundlachia moricandi
(Orbigny, 1837) (78.2%, n=197) (Fig. 2) and P. punctiferum
(5.1%, n=13). The Shannon-Wiener diversity index was
higher for the MS assemblages (Tab. II).

Based on previous studies (PARODIZ &amp;amp; HENNINGS,

P. punctiferum and P. sterkianum. In the assemblages of
AMS, G. moricandi and Biomphalaria sp. are
characteristics, and P. punctiferum, indifferent.

Thanatocoenoses. A total of 311 specimens,
belonging to 13 species of mollusks were recorded in the
studied thanatocoenoses (Tab. III). The bivalves totalled 90
individuals, and were represented by D. delodontus wymani
(Figs. 6, 7), Diplodon parallelopipedon (Lea, 1834) (Figs. 8,
9), Mycetopoda siliquosa (Spix, 1827) (Figs. 12, 13), C.
fluminea, C. largillierti (Figs. 18, 19), Neocorbicula limosa
(Maton, 1811), E. klappenbachi (Figs. 16, 17) and P.
sterkianum (Figs. 14, 15). Gastropods (n=221) were atributted
to five species, including: P. canaliculata (Fig. 4), Heleobia
aff. bertoniana Pilsbry, 1911, P. aff. orbigny (Fig. 3),
Potamolithus sp. and Biomphalaria sp. (Fig. 5). Pooling
the data, the dominant species in the thanatocoenoses are
P. aff. orbigny (Fig. 3), Potamolithus sp. and C. largillierti
(Figs. 18, 19). The highest richness and abundance were
recorded in the meandering-sector. However, this result was
not significantly different (p=0.076).

assemblages, both at station-scale and river-scale (RS).
However, the differences were not significantly different
(SS, p=0.530; MS, p=0.175; RS, p=0.140, respectively).
The total richness for the river’s death assemblage (S=13)
was similar to the total richness of the life assemblage
(S=12), and all the gastropod species in the
thanatocoenoses were also assigned in the biocoenoses.
Only three species of bivalves (A. trapesialis forbesianus,
Diplodon sp. and P. punctiferum) found in the
biocoenoses were not recorded in the thanatocoenoses
(Tabs. II, III).

The rank orders of the dominant species of the
thanatocoenoses were significantly and positively
correlated with those of the biocoenoses. The correlation
was good at river-scale (rs=0.56) and for the MS

assemblages (rs=0.59), but very low for the SS
assemblages (rs=0.34).

The live/dead agreement (Tab. IV) in the
meandering-sector was significantly higher (73%,
p=0.035) than in the straight-sector (50%) (Tabs. II, III).
Pooling the data, the index of similarity for the Touro
Passo River assemblages reaches 72 (Tab. IV). At river-
scale, live/dead (F1) agreement was 60%, and the dead/
live agreement (F2) was 47%. Despite of that, it should
be noted that 72.3% of the dead specimens were
represented in the biocoenoses (F3) (Tab. IV).

Whenever the live/dead agreement is analyzed at
station-scale, 60% of the species found alive were also
found dead in the SS. On the other hand, the dead/live
agreement reaches only 30% (Tab. IV), but 67.7% of the

dead specimens have living representatives (F3) (Tab.
IV). In the MS site, 66.6% of species found alive were
also found dead (F1), and 61.5% of the dead ones were
recorded alive (F2) (Tab. IV). The similarity of these values
is probably related to the same richness observed (S=11)
for both assemblages (Tabs. II, III). It is important to
emphasize here that the assemblages found in the MS
site showed significantly higher fidelity (p=0.012) than

the assemblages of the SS site. For example, nine species
(P. canaliculata, P. aff. orbigny, Potamolithus sp.,
Biomphalaria sp., D. delodontus wymani, C. fluminea,
C. largillierti, E. klappenbachi and P. sterkianum) found
dead in the assemblages of the meandering-sector were
also recorded in the live assemblages (F2). For the dead
specimens belonging to live species (F3), from the MS
site, fidelity was 86.9%, and significantly higher (p=0.009),

Quantitative fidelity of Recent freshwater mollusk assemblages...

than the assemblages from the SS site. The similarity
among the live/dead fidelities (F1) of both sectors was
not significantly different (p=0.911).

Among the bivalve species found by BOMBIN (1976)
and Édson Oliveira (pers. comm.) for the Touro Passo
River, some were not recorded in the studied life
assemblages, including: Leila blainvilliana (Lea, 1834),
Diplodon variabilis (Maton, 1811), D. parallelopipedon,
D. rhuacoicus (Orbigny, 1835), Castalia ambigua inflata
(Orbigny, 1835), A. tenebricosus, A. ferrarisi (Orbigny,
1835), A. patagonicus, A. trapezeus (Spix, 1827),
Mycetopoda legumen (Martens, 1888), M. siliquosa, M.
minuana and Monocondylaea corrientesensis (Orbigny,
1835). However, some of them (D. delodontus wymani,
D. parallelopipedon, C. fluminea, N. limosa) were
assigned in the studied death assemblages. Yet, it is
noteworthy that some bivalve species in the studied
molluscan fauna (e.g., A. ferrarisi, A. trapesialis
forbesianus, L. blainvilliana, M. legumen and M.
siliquosa) are declining or even disappearing (MANSUR
et al., 2003a), due to human induced environmental
changes and/or due to competition with alien species [C.
fluminea and Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857)] (MANSUR
&amp;amp; VEITENHEIMER-MENDES, 1976; MANSUR et al., 2003b).

The low levels of richness observed may be a result
of the short extension of the Touro Passo River (~55 km),
and the typical water volume oscillation along the seasons
(BOMBIN, 1976). This may generate adverse environmental
conditions to some species.

As far as the ecological fidelity, the presence of a
high number of species classified as preferential is an
unexpected characteristic of the studied life assemblages.
This is because freshwater mollusks are usually
considered generalists (DUARTE &amp;amp; DIEFENBACH, 1994;
MANSUR et al., 1994; PEREIRA et al., 2000a), and thus not
restricted to a particular fluvial environment. The unique

strange species found (Biomphalaria sp.) is a
representative of a genus whose species are common in
a wide variety of lentic environments. Species of
Biomphalaria are especially common in settings
characterized by slow current and marked by
anthropogenic influence (PEREIRA et al., 2000b). The shells
of Biomphalaria sp. might have been carried out into
the river from vicinal lentic settings (e.g., AMS), during
floodings. Similar lateral shell transport was already
recorded for this genus by CHIEFFI &amp;amp; MORETTI (1979). The
species classified as indifferent (P. canaliculata) inhabits
lotic and lentic environments, and also shows a wide
environmental distribution. This species can cope with
the dry conditions among seasons, and eutrophic
conditions (CAZZANIGA, 1987; ESTEBENET &amp;amp; CAZZANIGA,
1992; MARTÍN et al., 2001; PEREIRA et al., 2000a, 2001).
The presence of a large number of species assigned as
preferentials indicates the high ecological fidelity of the
biocoenosis of the Touro Passo River.

Among the three species recorded in the AMS site,
the dominant species (G. moricandi), and also
Biomphalaria sp., are commonly associated with aquatic
vegetation (BONETTO et al., 1982; SANTOS &amp;amp; FREITAS, 1986;
LANZER, 1996; PEREIRA et al., 2000a,b). Therefore,
environments such as the abandoned meander could be
a favorable place to species assigned as strange or
indifferent to thrive. These settings could also act as a
place to shell dispersion to other nearby environments
as well.

It is important to emphasize that the taxonomic
composition of the studied molluscan assemblages is not
the one expected for a fourth-order river. In such rivers,
according to the River Continumm Concept, the richness
and abundance of scrapers/grazers (gastropod) and
collectors (bivalve) species are expected to be similar
(ALLAN, 1996; NAIMAN &amp;amp; BILBY, 1998). In general, the
predominance of the latter suggests the presence of large
sections and/or the proximity of the river’s mouth (NAIMAN
&amp;amp; BILBY, 1998).

At the station-level, the higher richness and
abundance showed by the substations of the MS site,
although not significantly different (see results), seems
a reflection of the higher habitat diversity of this river
sector. This includes settings with different bottom types,
variable current velocities (lentic and lotic facies) and
the ephemerous presence of isolated water pools. Also,
the higher Shannon-Wiener index obtained (Tab. IV)
suggests that the MS life assemblages are more
homogeneous, regarding the species frequency.

In general, the species P. aff. orbigny, Potamolithus
sp. and C. largillierti were dominant in the MS life
assemblages and in the whole Touro Passo River as well.
The substations MS02, MS04 and MS05 showed,
simultaneously, the three species, reinforcing their
ecological preference for sites with coarse sands, shallow
water conditions with intermitent water flows (ITUARTE,
1994; LÓ PEZ ARMENGOL &amp;amp; DARRIGRAN, 1998). In the
straight-sector, only one species (P. aff. orbigny) is
dominant. This was recorded in the substations SS01,
SS02 and SS03, where silt-dominated bottoms (sometimes
with coarse to fine sands), no aquatic plants, and strong
and continuous currents prevail (Tab. I). These

environmental conditions seem to favor the presence of
species belonging to the genus Potamolithus (DI PERSIA
&amp;amp; OLAZARRI, 1986; LÓ PEZ ARMENGOL &amp;amp; DARRIGRAN, 1998;
PEREIRA et al., 2000a,b).

Several previous studies in marine (KIDWELL &amp;amp;
BOSENCE, 1991; KIDWELL &amp;amp; FLESSA, 1995; BEST &amp;amp; KIDWELL,
2000; KOWALEWSKI et al., 2003) and freshwater (BRIGGS et
al., 1990; WARREN, 1991; CUMMINS, 1994) environments
suggest that the richness and the abundance are usually
higher in the thanatocoenoses than in the biocoenoses.
However, the richness of the studied thanatocoenoses
is not remarkable different of the biocoenoses (Tabs. II,
III). In fact, both share nine species at river-scale, differing
only by the presence of the utmost four species (Heleobia
aff. bertoniana, D. parallelopipedon, M. siliquosa and
N. limosa). The abundance of the thanatocoenoses was
also lower than that already reported in the literature.
This may reflect the differences in the sedimentary regime
of the studied freshwater environments. Due to the
differences in the sedimentary processes (e.g., net
sedimentation rate) shell accumulation rates in freshwater
environments are usually lower than in the shelf marine
environments (PETERSON, 1976; COHEN, 1989; BRIGGS et
al., 1990; WARREN, 1991; CUMMINS, 1994; KIDWELL &amp;amp;
FLESSA, 1995).

Study in reservoirs, east-central Ohio, USA (see
CUMMINS, 1994), showed that death and life assemblages
of Unionacea exhibit high ranges of rank order correlation
(rs=-0.06 to 0.57), especially to the non-regulated courses.
On the other hand, the regulated ones showed lower
ranges, but with positive and high values at site-scale
(rs=0.67 a 0.89, CUMMINS, 1994). These differences are
interpreted as response to the water energy, particularly
to the low-energy conditions that prevails in the
reservoirs (CUMMINS, 1994). At river-scale, the rank order

correlation recorded by CUMMINS (1994) was rs=0.64.
Similarly, the rank order correlation recorded to the Touro
Passo River was rs=0.56. Hence, despite of the unexpected
values of the richness and abundance of the studied
death assemblages, the ranking of dominance was similar
to that previously recorded in the literature for other
freshwater shelly thanatocoenoses (WARREN, 1991;
CUMMINS, 1994). Additionally, our data also show that
among the six dominant species (Potamolithus sp., P. aff.
orbigny, C. largillierti, Biomphalaria sp., C. fluminea
and P. canaliculata) of the thanatocoenoses of the Touro
Passo River, five (the exception is Biomphalaria sp.) are
also dominants in the biocoenoses. Corbicula largillierti
shows the third order position in both assemblages. This
is in accordance with the general idea that the ranking of
dominance at river-scale is preserved in the
thanatocoenosis.

The index of similarity among the live and death
assemblages of the Touro Passo River was high (0.72),
and similar to that observed by CUMMINS (1994) for the
non-regulated areas of Ohio reservoirs (0.67 to 0.70). In
the Touro Passo River, the recorded indexes for each
collecting stations were 0.50 (SS) and 0.73 (MS), ranging
from 0.28 (SS01) to 0.90 (MS02) among the substations
(Tab. IV). At station-level, the differences are probably
related to the less energetic conditions that prevail in the
meandering-sector. At substation-level, the differences
might be associated with particular local conditions (e.g.,
margin declivity, bottom type and the presence/ausence
of terrestrial and aquatic plants) (see also BRIGGS et al.,
1990). Consequently, despite of the discontinuous
distribution of the species in the sampled death
assemblages from the SS and MS sectors, the
thanatocoenoses yielded nearly similar abundance and
richness with the local life assemblages.

Quantitative fidelity of Recent freshwater mollusk assemblages...

Our fidelity (F1, F2) results (Tab. IV), at river-scale,
are somewhat distinct of those previously reported in
the literature. For example, CUMMINS (1994) obtained F1
and F2 values of 83% to 100%, and of 50% to 58%,
respectively for freshwater assemblages of US-reservoirs.
Other authors (KIDWELL &amp;amp; FLESSA, 1995) noted that, as
general condition, assemblages generated under
freshwater environments yield the following values: F1
(=95%), and F2 (=55%). Assemblages of the Touro Passo
River, yielded F1 values as low as 60%, and F2 values
(=47.3%), nearly comparable with those previously
reported by CUMMINS (1994) and KIDWELL &amp;amp; FLESSA (1995).
However, it should be stressed that the slightly low F1
and F2 values noted here may be due to the adoption of
distinct methodological decisions among studies,
including exhaustive analyses, which include fragments
(BRIGGS et al., 1990; CUMMINS, 1994; KOWALEWSKI et al.,
2003), and the use of target taxa, especially among bivalve
mollusks (Unionacea) (WARREN, 1991; CUMMINS, 1994).
Besides this, it should be also remembered that the
sedimentary environments are not the same for all those
studies. Hence, the differences may reflect the distinct
sedimentary/taphonomic processes that operate in each
environment (see also PIP, 1988; BRIGGS et al., 1990). On
the other hand, the low number of species found alive
that are also found dead (F1), can be attributed to the
factors that may control the abundance and/or the
temporal- and spatial-mixing of the shells. These include
the downstream drifting and the fast dissolution of the
shells under freshwater conditions (COHEN, 1989; BRIGGS
et al., 1990; WARREN, 1991). However, it is also important
to emphasize that the numerically dominant species are
more easily recorded than the others, as indicated by the
Spearman rank correlation and F3 values (Tab. IV).

At station-scale, the higher percentages of dead
species also found in the life assemblages (F2) and the
number of dead individuals representing species also
found alive (F3) recorded in the MS site could be
associated with the continuous downstream flow, from
the straight-sector, that probably transports the shells,
and with the physical properties prevailing in the
meandering-sector. In the latter, the presence of coarse
bottoms and riparian vegetation (Tab. I) may provide
stable conditions, allowing the trapping of the shells,
favoring its accumulation (see BRIGGS et al., 1990, for a
similar example).

At river-scale, 72% of the dead individuals
represented species found alive (F3), while at substation-
scale, F3 values range from 29.2% to 87.6%. These results
are in the range of the data available in the literature. For
example, CUMMINS (1994) reported F3 values ranging from
58% to 97% to the non-regulated streams of the North
America reservoirs. KIDWELL &amp;amp; BOSENCE (1991) assigned
F3 values ranging from 70% to 90% for assemblages
generated in marine environments.

CONCLUSIONS

The taxonomic composition of the analyzed
molluscan biocoenoses of the Touro Passo River is
characteristic of the lotic settings that prevail in the study
area. However, it does not reflect the river-order, and is

not consistent with the River Continuum Concept.
Ecological attributes (abundance, richness and

diversity) of the studied biocoenoses are not sensitive
to particular environmental conditions (e.g., channel
morphology). However, they may reflect the complex
interaction among the natural factors, including the
presence/absence of aquatic and terrestrial vegetation,
differences in current velocity and bottom type of the
different studied river-sectors.

The rank order of the dominant species of the Touro
Passo River in the thanatocoenoses could be used to
infer the ranking of the most abundant species in the
original life assemblages.

The low number of species found alive that were
also found dead (F1) in the studied assemblages may be
a result of the lotic environmental conditions prevailing
in the Touro Passo River. This may favor quick shell
dissolution, avoiding the accumulation of the non-
contemporaneous remains. Hence, rates of time-averaging
may be low for those assemblages.

The low values of dead/live agreement reported
here are quite similar to that already published in the
freshwater molluscan literature. Hence, the studied death
assemblages are not faithful mirrors of the original
biocoenoses. However, the number of dead individuals
that are also found alive (F3) is high. Consequently, this
may be a useful tool in the reconstruction of some
particular attributes of the original biocoenoses (e.g., the
dominant species and their ranking order).
