The purpose of this study was to evaluate the water sorption, solubility, pH and ability to 
diffuse into dentin of a glycerol salicylate-based, pulp-capping cement in comparison to 
a conventional calcium hydroxide-based pulp capping material (Hydcal). An experimental 
cement was developed containing 60% glycerol salicylate resin, 10% methyl salicylate, 
25% calcium hydroxide and 5% Portland cement. Water sorption and solubility were 
determined based on mass changes in the samples before and after the immersion in 
distilled water for 7 days. Material discs were stored in distilled water for 24 h, 7 days 
and 28 days, and a digital pHmeter was used to measure the pH of water. The cement’s 
ability to diffuse into bovine dentin was assessed by Raman spectroscopy. The glycerol 
salicylate-based cement presented higher water sorption and lower solubility than 
Hydcal. The pH of water used to store the samples increased for both cements, reaching 
12.59±0.06 and 12.54±0.05 after 7 days, for Hydcal and glycerol salicylate-based cements, 
respectively. Both cements were able to turn alkaline the medium at 24 h and sustain 
its alkalinity after 28 days. Hydcal exhibited an intense diffusion into dentin up to 40 
µm deep, and the glycerol salicylate-based cement penetrated 20 µm. The experimental 
glycerol salicylate-based cement presents good sorption, solubility, ability to alkalize 
the surrounding tissues and diffusion into dentin to be used as pulp capping material.

Introduction
Conservative treatment of deep caries with pulp 

exposure has been performed for centuries. In 1756, 
Phillip Pfaff proposed that exposed pulp could be capped 
by gold sheet to protect the vital tissue, in an attempt 
to avoid the progress of the inflammatory process and 
necrosis (1). The materials used for direct or indirect  pulp 
capping should stimulate the reparative dentin formation, 
act against bacteria, be radiopaque, adhere to dentin and 
to restorative materials, be resistant to masticatory forces 
and seal the cavity (1).

From the use of gold sheet until today, several materials 
with different compositions have been used in pulp capping 
procedures (2-4). Calcium hydroxide-based cements, first 
used by Hermann in 1920 (5), have been considered the “gold 
standard” cements for pulp protection. Calcium hydroxide 
(CH) powder can be mixed with water or incorporated into 
a resinous matrix, generally a salicylate ester, to obtain a 
self-setting cement. CH-based cements release calcium and 
hydroxyl ions, encouraging the formation of a reparative 
dentin (6) and killing bacteria (7). For indirect pulp capping 
it is important that cements be able to diffuse into dentin 
in order to signal the pulp cells.

More recently (8), mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) 
was introduced in Endodontics and showed better 

clinical performance used as direct pulp capping agent 
than CH-based cements (9). MTA presents a chemical 
composition similar to Portland cement clinker, with the 
addition of bismuth oxide to improve its radiopacity (8). 
MTA’s mechanism of action is similar to that of calcium 
hydroxide, as its interaction with water produces calcium 
hydroxide during the cement setting. In comparison to 
CH-based cements, MTA has lower solubility and higher 
mechanical properties and calcium ion release (3). However, 
pure MTA as pulp capping is difficult due to the longer 
setting time and poor handling. To take advantage of the 
beneficial properties of MTA and to produce a cement 
with improved handling properties, MTA and Portland 
have been incorporated into non-aqueous vehicles, such 
as acrylic monomers or resins (2,10,11). To date, no pulp-
capping materials based on salicylate resin including MTA 
or Portland in their composition have been developed.

Salicylate compounds are widely used in the 
pharmaceutical industry and have anti-inflammatory 
potential (12). Aiming to produce a low-solubility 
salicylate, a glycerol salicylate was synthesized from the 
transesterification reaction of glycerol and methyl salicylate 
(13). This glycerol salicylate can present up to three reactive 
groups to chelate calcium ions and set, instead of the 
two reactive sites present in dissalicylates usually used

in commercial CH-based pulp capping cements. Glycerol 
salicylate molecules are composed of three salicylates 
bonded to a central glycerol, which confers high viscosity 
to the resin. Thus, a diluent such as the methyl salicylate, 
is required to adjust resin viscosity and make it suitable 
for clinical use.

This study evaluated the water sorption, solubility, pH 
and ability to diffuse into dentin of experimental glycerol 
salicylate-based pulp-capping cement in comparison to 
conventional calcium hydroxide-based cement.

Material and Methods
An experimental cement was developed consisting of 

60% glycerol salicylate resin, obtained according to Portella 
et al. (13), 10% methyl salicylate (Vetec Química Fina Ltda, 
Duque de Caxias, RJ, Brazil), 25% calcium hydroxide (CH; 
Biodinâmica, Ibiporã, PR, Brazil) and 5% Portland cement 
(CP IV-32; Votorantim Cimentos, Esteio, RS, Brazil). The 
above concentrations refer to the weight percentage. 
Liquid (glycerol salicylate resin and methyl salicylate) and 
powder (calcium hydroxide and Portland cement) reagents 
were weighed on an analytical scale, according to the 
above concentrations and hand mixed on a glass plate. 
Fresh mixtures of the cements were inserted into silicon 
matrix to produce sample discs of 10±0.1 mm diameter 
and 1.0±0.01 mm thick. Samples remained stored at 36 
ºC in a humid cabinet up to the complete setting of the 
materials. The experimental cement’s sorption, solubility, 
pH and cement diffusion into dentin were compared with 
those of a commercial pulp capping cement (Hydcal; 
Technew Com. Ind. Ltda, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil). Hydcal 
was manipulated according manufacturer instructions, by 
hand mixing equal amounts of base and catalyst pastes.

Sorption and Solubility
Sorption and solubility were evaluated as described in 

a previous study (14). Three samples were soaked in 10 mL 
of distilled water at 36 °C for 7 days. The volume (V) of 
the specimens was calculated before immersion. The mass 
of the specimens was determined before (m1), immediately 
after water immersion (m2) and after drying (m3). Before 
m1 and m3 were assessed, the specimens were kept in 
desiccators and weighed every 24 h, until a constant mass 
was obtained. Water sorption (Wsp) and water solubility 
(Wsl) were calculated according to the following equations, 
and the mean values of three specimens were recorded:

Wsp=(m2?m3)/V
Wsl=(m1?m3)/V

pH Analysis
The pH of storage water from the sorption and solubility 

tests, and water from other samples stored in the same 

way for 24 h and 28 days, were evaluated using a digital 
pHmeter (DM-23; Digicrom Analytical Ltda, São Paulo, SP, 
Brazil). Three measurements were performed per group 
for each period, at 24 h, 7 days and 28 days. The initial 
pH of the distilled water was 7.79. Formation of crystals 
during water storage in the pH test was observed by direct 
visualization. The crystals were characterized by Raman 
spectroscopy using a 785 nm laser (Senterra; Bruker Optics, 
Ettlingen, Germany).

Raman Analysis of Cement Diffusion
The buccal enamel of two bovine incisors was ground 

to expose the superficial dentin. The dentin was prepared 
with 600-grit SiC paper for 30 s in running water. The 
experimental cements were manipulated and applied over 
the exposed dentin, and then restored using a self-etching 
adhesive system (Clearfil SE Bond; Kuraray America Inc., 
New York, NY, USA) and a micro-hybrid composite resin 
(Charisma; Heraeus Kulzer GmbH, Hanau, Germany) 
to simulate clinical situation. The teeth were stored in 
simulated body fluid (SBF) (15) at 36 ºC for 28 days. SBF had 
the following ion concentration, in mol/m³: Na+ (142.0), K+ 
(5.0), Mg2+ (1.5), Ca2+ (2.5), Cl- (147.8), HCO3- (4.2), HPO42- 
(1.0) and SO42- (0.5). The pH was adjusted to 7.4.

The teeth were sectioned longitudinally to the crown 
axis at the center of the restoration. The hemisections were 
sonicated for 180 s to remove debris and the specimens were 
analyzed by micro-Raman spectroscopy (Senterra, Bruker). 
Mapping areas of 100 x 100 µm of dentin underneath the 
cement (Fig. 1) were analyzed. The samples were irradiated 
on 100 points. Each point was irradiated 2 times for 5 s 
by a 785 nm 100 mW laser. The spectra were obtained, 
the integrals of the 1,084 and 1,034 cm-1 peaks were 
determined for each point and the values were plotted onto 
a graph. The 1,084 and 1,034 cm-1 peaks relate to calcium 
hydroxide chemical bonds (13) and to bands of salicylate 
resin chemical bonds (16), respectively.

Statistical Analysis
Differences in sorption and solubility were analyzed 

by t tests, and the differences in pH values were analyzed 
using two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test. The significance 
level was set at 5%.

Results
Table 1 shows the water sorption and solubility and pH of 

water storage after different periods. There were significant 
differences in sorption (p=0.015) and solubility (p=0.049) 
between the materials, glycerol salicylate-based cement 
exhibiting higher water sorption and lower solubility values 
compared with Hydcal. Both cements were able to alkalize 
the medium at 24 h and sustain the alkalinity after 28 days.

The presence of crystals was observed in the pH test 
water for the glycerol salicylate-based cement after 28 days. 
One of these crystals and its Raman spectrum are shown in 
Figure 2. The micro Raman analysis of the crystal exhibits 
550, 665, 836, 886, 1050 and 1159 cm-1 bands (Fig. 2c). 

Figure 3 shows representative spectra of non-infiltrated 
dentin and dentin infiltrated by cement. Raman band shift 
presented 804, 962, 1034 and 1084 cm-1 peaks. Figure 4 
shows the intensity of the 1084 and 1034cm-1 peaks on 
the mapped dentin adjacent to the cement after sample 
storage in SBF. The sample of Hydcal presented an intense 
diffusion of cement up to 40 µm depth. The tooth that 
received the glycerol salicylate-based cement showed 
cement penetration up to 20 µm but this diffusion was not 
consistent for the entire region, as in the Hydcal sample.

Discussion
In this study, novel pulp-capping cement based on a 

salicylate resin, calcium hydroxide and Portland cement 
was developed and had the physicochemical properties 

of sorption, solubility, pH and the ability to diffuse into 
dentin compared with Hydcal (a commercial calcium 
hydroxide-based pulp-capping cement of similar chemical 
composition). Hydcal is basically composed of salicylate 
resin and calcium hydroxide. Prior the development of 
glycerol salicylate-based pulp-capping cement, a set of 
Portland cement concentrations was tested, ranging from 
5 to 15%. Calcium hydroxide was replaced by Portland 
cement in the mixture. Due to the low availability of Ca2+ 
in groups with higher Portland contents, the setting times 
increased and cement became too dark (since grey Portland 
cement was used to formulate experimental cements in 
pilot studies). Furthermore, the cement without calcium 
hydroxide did not set. Based on that, it was assumed 
that 5% (in weight) of Portland cement represented 
the concentration that exerted less influence on the 
experimental cement’s properties (setting time and color).

Glycerol salicylate-based cement is set by an acid-
base reaction between calcium hydroxide and salicylate 
resin. Calcium is chelated by salicylate, forming a calcium 
salicylate salt (13). This is a similar hardening process to 
that of available commercial calcium hydroxide cements. 
Nevertheless, the majority of current cements are composed 
of a dysfunctional salicylate ester (21,22), unlike the resin 
used in this study, which presents up to three salicylates in 
its molecule, which theoretically allows the binding of up 
to three calcium ions by the same molecule, contributing 
to the lower solubility of glycerol salicylate-based cement 
in comparison to Hydcal. Additionally, in contact with 
humidity Portland cement hydrates, forming a hydrated 
calcium silicate matrix and calcium hydroxide. Portland 
hydration and crystal formation occurred when the glycerol 
salicylate-based cement was immersed in water. Silicate 
bending bands at 665 cm-1 and symmetrical stretching 
bands at 800-1050 cm-1, characteristic of calcium silicate 
hydrate are presented in Figure 2. Band 1050 cm-1 could 
be also present in glycerol resin. However, the crystal was 
not analyzed in contact with grycerol resin, indicating the 
correspondence of 1050 cm-1 to calcium silicate hydrate. The 
550 cm-1 and 1159 cm-1 bands can be assigned to alite and 
belite, and to bassanite, respectively, probably present due an 

incomplete hydration of 
Portland cement (17,18). 
Water uptake promoted 
by the Portland cement 
could lead to hydraulic 
setting, promoting the 
formation of a calcium 
silicate hydrate matrix 
(23), which has the 
potential to stimulate 
mineral deposition in

contact with biological fluids, such as dentinal fluid. In 
this way, the chemical features of cement after hydration 
lead to a bioactive surface that possibly may help to form 
reparative dentin, stimulating the mineralization of tissues.

Aside from higher water sorption of the glycerol 
salicylate-based cement, its solubility was lower than 
Hydcal. The great amount of salicylate resin used in the 
experimental cement could explain these patterns of 
sorption and solubility. The salicylate resin matrix, present 
on both cements, contributes to elevated water sorption 
and solubility, insofar as salicylate-based cements are prone 
to absorbing water (24) and solubilizing (11,25). Higher 
water sorption could lead to cement swelling, offsetting 
the negative dimensional changes that occur with the 
cement’s solubilization. However, the dimensional changes 
of the cements after water sorption were not assessed. 
As in a previous study (14), neither the ISO 6876 (Dental 
root canal sealing materials) nor ISO 9917 (Water-based 
cements) parameters were adopted to measure sorption and 
solubility, since both tested cements are resin-based and the 
aforementioned parameters are designed for water-based 
cements and root canal sealing materials. The lack of an 
international standard method to assess the properties of 
resin-modified calcium silicate cements has already been 
pointed out (2).

Fluid stability is important for maintaining an effective 
seal against bacteria and preventing the development 
of defects under restorations, which could impair the 
restoration’s resistance (26). In a previous study, the authors 
stated that traditional calcium hydroxide-based cements 
dissolve over time in a short period (i.e., 2 years) (2). The 

low solubility levels of glycerol salicylate-based cement 
followed by cement diffusion in dentin and calcium-
silicate crystal formation could mitigate this shortcoming. 
Moreover, Portland cement has recognized bioactivity, 
stimulating the production of an apatite structure over 
its surface in contact with tissues (27) and allowing the 
expression of mRNAs from a dentin-specific protein and 
a non-collagen protein involved in mineralization (28). 
These properties could accelerate the development of a 
mineralized barrier over the exposed pulp.

Recently, a practice-based randomized clinical trial 
evaluated the success of direct pulp capping in permanent 
teeth performed with both calcium hydroxide and MTA as 
pulp-capping cements, and estimates that the failure rates 
after 24 months reached 31.5% and 19.7% for teeth pulp 
capped with calcium hydroxide and MTA, respectively (9). 
These results corroborate those of Mente et al. (29), where 
MTA showed a higher success rate than calcium hydroxide 
(78% vs. 60%). For direct pulp capping, both materials 
present the same success rates and ability to stimulate 
reparative dentin formation (30). Thus, to improve the 
handling properties of MTA or Portland and optimize its 
results on direct pulp capping, MTA was incorporated on 
a salicylate resin matrix (10,11).

The anti-inflammatory potential of salicylates is 
probably present in salicylate resins. Salicylates are 
capable of inhibiting the action of cyclooxygenase-2 and 
consequently the synthesis of prostaglandin (12). This 
anti-inflammatory property is desirable for cements that 
will be placed in contact with pulp tissue to reduce the 
inflammatory process provoked by caries progression, in 
an attempt to prevent the development of pulp necrosis 
and/or postoperative sensitivity.

Glycerol salicylate-based cement and Hydcal were able 
to elevate water pH above 8.5 after 24 h of immersion. This

is the optimum pH for alkaline phosphatase, which plays 
an important function in tissue mineralization (31). The 
alkalinity of both cements increased to pH=12 at 7 days and 
decreased slightly after 28 days, but both cements sustained 
the high pH. The increase in pH is probably due to hydroxyl 
ions being released from the calcium hydroxide originally 
present in the cements’ compositions and from the calcium 
hydroxide formed from the hydration of Portland cement.

Experimental glycerol salicylate-based Portland cement 
did not show the same diffusion pattern into dentin as 
Hydcal does, when evaluated using Raman to map the 
intensity of 1,084 and 1,034 cm-1 peaks related to the 
chemical bonds of calcium hydroxide and salicylate resin, 
respectively. For the non-infiltrated dentin, the peak at the 
962 cm-1 band corresponds to symmetric stretching mode of 
phosphate (19). In the spectrum of the dentin adjacent to 
the cement, other peaks were noticed, like 1,084 cm-1, which 
is present for calcium hydroxide (13), and at 1,034 and 804 
cm-1, which refer to bending in plane CH mode (16,20) and 
to the stretching Caromatic-COOH of salicylate resin (16). The 
diffusion of cement components, such as calcium hydroxide, 
into dentin is expected to be beneficial for reparative dentin 
formation. Hydcal presents ethyl toluene sulfonamide in 
its composition, a plasticizer that could decrease cement 
viscosity and improve penetration into dentin. The glycerol

salicylate-based cement is a model cement, and its other 
physical-chemical properties should be adjusted before in 
vivo tests. Future research should be conducted focusing 
on adjusting the setting time and radiopacity.

The experimental glycerol salicylate-based cement 
presents good sorption, solubility and ability to alkalize 
the surrounding tissues and diffuse into dentin to be used 
as pulp capping material.

Resumo
O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a sorção e solubilidade em água, pH e 
habilidade de difusão na dentina de um cimento para capeamento pulpar 
à base de glicerol salicilato e compará-lo a um cimento comercial para 
capeamento pulpar à base de hidróxido de cálcio (Hydcal). Um cimento 
experimental contendo 60% de resina de glicerol salicilato, 10% de salicilato 
de metila, 25% de hidróxido de cálcio e 5% de cimento Portland foi 
formulado. Sorção e solubilidade em água foram determinadas a partir da 
alteração na massa de espécimes antes e após a imersão em água destilada 
por 7 dias. Discos dos cimentos foram armazenados em água destilada 
por 24h, 7 dias e 28 dias e o pH da água foi aferido após cada período. A 
habilidade de difundir-se no interior de dentina bovina foi avaliada por 
espectroscopia Raman. O cimento à base de glicerol salicilato apresentou 
maior sorção e menor solubilidade em comparação com o Hydcal. O pH da 
água de armazenamento dos espécimes aumentou para ambos os cimentos, 
chegando a 12,59±0,06 e 12,54±0,05 após 7 dias, para o Hydcal e o cimento 
à base de glicerol salicilato, respectivamente. Os cimentos foram capazes de 
promover a alcalinização do meio após 24h e sustentaram a alcalinidade 
após 28 dias. Hydcal exibiu intensa difusão na dentina até 40 ?m de 
profundidade e o cimento à base de glicerol salicilato penetrou 20 ?m. O 
cimento experimental à base de glicerol salicilato apresentou adequada 
sorção, solubilidade, habilidade de alcalinizar o meio e difundir-se no 
interior da dentina para uso como um material para capeamento pulpar.
