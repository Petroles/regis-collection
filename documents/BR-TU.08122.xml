Chemical stabilization of tropical soils: physical, 

chemical, mineralogical and microstructural 
characterization 

Abstract. This paper reports the physical, chemical, mineralogical and microstructural 

characterization of three soils of the Zona da Mata of Minas Gerais State, Brazil, and 

their mixtures with the chemical stabilizer RBI Grade 81 for geotechnical engineering 

purposes. The investigation consisted of: (i) one mature residual soil (soil 1) and two 

less weathered soils (soils 2 and 3) on gneiss; (ii) stabilizer contents of 2%, 4% and 6% 

regarding soil dry weight; (iii) mixtures specimens cured during seven days in a 

conditioning chamber; (iv) soils and mixtures specimens compacted at the standard and 

modified Proctor compaction efforts, for microstructural characterization. The results 

indicated that the chemical stabilizer promoted considerable changes in all physical, 

chemical, mineralogical and microstructural properties of studied soils. There were 

observed changes in texture and plasticity, increases in pH and CEC and decreases in 

exchangeable acidity. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) analyses indicated 

that contents of Si and Al oxides in soils decrease after chemical stabilization, probably 

by solubilization of these oxides and Ca silicates and aluminates formation during 

hydration and/or pozzolanic reactions of chemical stabilizer with soils. With reference 

to mineralogy, the chemical stabilizer addition resulted in peak reduction of all clay 

minerals and the formation of rankinite, a Ca-silicate in a well-crystalline form, easily 

identified by X-ray diffraction, strengthening the conclusions gotten from the EDS 

analyses. The microstructure of soils subjected to high compaction effort (modified 

Proctor) showed the development of microfractures and unconnected crack voids in 

soil 1, whereas in the sand soils 2 and 3 we also observed widespread break of quartz 

grains. The chemical stabilizer addition accounted for the formation of well-developed 

cementation nuclei, notably in soil 3 mixture.

7.1. Introduction 
The perfecting of chemical stabilization techniques for tropical soils requires 

the development of extensive laboratory and field experimentation to attain the 

engineering standards to comply with the technical norms. Regarding laboratory 

programs, an important step to be executed is the characterization of the physical, 

chemical, mineralogical and microstructural characteristics of soils and their mixtures 

with the chemical additives used, thus creating essential parameters for a complete 

technical assessment, together with data on the mechanical strength and durability of the 

end product. 

Thus the objective of this study was to widen the Brazilian databank on the 

physical, chemical, mineralogical and microstructural characteristics of soils stabilized 

chemically for geotechnical purposes, especially for highway applications. Three 

residual gneiss soils of the Zona da Mata of Minas Gerais State, Brazil, mixed with the 

RBI Grade 81 chemical stabilizer were characterized technologically. 

RBI Grade 81 is chemical stabilizer commercialized by the Anyway Solid 

Environmental Solutions Ltd. Kerem Maharal Corporation for highway construction 

applications. In the last decade the product was recognized internationally as a highway 

pavement layers stabilizer, in the functions of improving the subgrade, sub-base, base 

and first cover, which has been applied in several countries on the African continent and 

in some countries in Europe, such as Portugal, Spain and Italy. It has been little used in 

Brazil and the only reference is the construction of the base layer of the service patio of 

the Vallourec &amp;amp; Mannesmann do Brazil S.A. Corporation in Belo Horizonte, Minas 

Gerais State, which showed promising results (LIMA et al., 2003). Regarding 

Laboratory studies on the Brazilian soils stabilized with RBI Grade 81, data recently 

presented in the studies by Caneschi et al. (2004), França (2003), Machado et al. (2001) 

and Trindade et al. (2005a, 2005b, 2005c, 2006a, 2006b, 2006c) showed that the 

product accounted for substantial improvements in the mechanical properties of 

different types of soils (ranging from highly plastic clays to sandy soils), but the most 

expressive mechanical strengths gains generally occurred in mixtures of the chemical 

additive with granular soils. 

The following will be discussed as specific topics in the present study: (i) 

influence of the chemical additive content on the physical (Atterberg limits, grain size

distribution, grain unit weight), chemical (pH, cationic exchange capacity and potential 

acidity) and mineralogical soils properties; (ii) effects of applying different compaction 

efforts and the addition of chemical stabilizer on the microstructural characteristics of 

the soils using images obtained from optical microscope (OM) and secondary electron 

signals generated in a scanning electronic microscope (SEM); (iii) effects of the 

chemical stabilizer incorporation on chemical elements contents measured by energy 

dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) analyses. 

Materials and experimental methods 

7.2.1. Materials 

The present study was carried out on three tropical soils derived from Pre-

Cambrian gneiss, forming a clay-sand-silt sample collected in the B horizon of a mature 

residual soil (soil 1), classified pedologically as Red-Yellow Latosol, and two sand-silt-

clay samples collected in the C horizon from two young residual soils (soils 2 and 3). 

The soil stabilizing agent used was RBI Grade 81, at contents of 2%, 4% and 6% 

compared to the dry soil weight. Further information on the soils and the chemical 

stabilizer assessed in this study can be found in Trindade et al. (2006a, 2006b). 

7.2.2. Methods 

7.2.2.1. Soils sampling 

The samples were collected with hand tools in cutting trenches, packed in 

50 kg plastic bags and identified by labels containing the data on the soil origin.  The 

bags were then taken to the Civil Engineering Laboratory (LEC) of the Civil 

Engineering Department (DEC) at the University of Federal University of Viçosa were 

at they were air dried, broken up, sifted through a 4.8 mm mesh and placed in plastic 

bags for later use. 



 

 121

7.2.2.2. Physical and chemical characterization 

The geotechnical characterization was carried out following the 

recommendations of the Brazilian Technical Standards Association (ABNT). The tests 

carried out were: (i) sieve analysis (ABNT, 1984d); (ii) determination of liquidity limit  

(ABNT, 1984a); (iii) determination of plasticity limit and plasticity index  

(ABNT, 1984c); and (iv) determination of grain unit weight (ABNT, 1984b). 

The chemical analyses were performed according to the procedures of the 

Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA, 1997), and the mean value of 

three determinations was considered for each analysis. The pH in H2O was determined 

by a potentiometer, using proportions of 1:2.5 (volume/volume) soil:solution. The Ca2+ 

and Mg2+ exchangeable cations were extracted in KCl 1 mol/L and determined by 

atomic absorption spectrometry. The Al3+ cation, extracted by KCl 1 mol/L, was 

determined volumetrically by titrating with NaOH 0.025 mol/L. The potential acidity 

(H+ + Al3+) was determined by extraction with 0.5 mol/L calcium acetate at pH 7.0 and 

later titrating with NaOH. The K+ and Na+ cations were extracted by Mehlich-1 

extractor and determined by flame photometry. The following were determined from the 

results of these analyses: (i) the sum of the exchangeable bases (SB): Ca + Mg + K + 

Na; (ii) cation exchange capacity (CEC): SB + (H + Al); and (iii) percentage base 

saturation (V%): (SB / CEC) x 100. 

The procedures recommended by the ABNT (1986a) were followed for the 

preparation of the disturbed samples for the laboratory tests, while the chemically 

stabilized soil samples used in the physical and chemical property characterization 

experiments were prepared according to the description in the following paragraphs. 

The samples of each one of the soils were placed in 2 kg plastic bags to which 

the chemical additive was added in amounts of 2%, 4% and 6% content, then 

homogenized to incorporate it uniformly in the soils to maximize the occurrence of the 

soil additive reaction processes. Finally, each one of the samples received a quantity of 

water necessary to reach the optimum moisture contents determined in the compaction 

tests carried out at the Standard Proctor compaction effort. The plastic bags were sealed 

and placed in a moist chamber with relative air humidity greater than 95%, then starting 

the cure time of the mixtures. After seven-day cure time, the samples were air dried, 

broken up in a pestle with a hand mortar and sieved through a 2 mm mesh. The 



 

 122

hygroscopic moisture was determined in each one of the samples and experiments were 

performed to determine the physical and chemical properties. 

7.2.2.3. Mineralogical characterization 

The soil mineralogy (soils 1, 2 and 3, and adding mixture) was identified by X-

ray diffractometry, using the two soils fractions separated by the 53 ?m mesh. 

Powdered specimens from the ? 53 ?m fraction were mounted in excavated glass slide, 

using neutral glue for fixing the sample, avoiding any orientation. Oriented samples 

were mounted with the &amp;lt;53 ?m fraction of analyzed materials, allowing the settling of 

drops suspension onto a glass slide, followed by air-drying. 

All samples were cobalt-irradiated (Co-K?) in the 4° and 50° 2? interval, using 

a X-ray diffractometer manufactured by Rigaku Radiation Shield Company set with a 

speed of 2° 2?/min, fitted with a nickel filter. Data acquisition was made automatically 

at each 0.05° 2?. 

7.2.2.4. Microstructural characterization 

The microstructural characterization was carried out by means of optical and 

scanning-electron microscopy and microanalysis, for soils samples 1, 2 and 3, as well as 

its mixtures with 6% of chemical stabilizer, which were previously cured for seven days 

in a wet chamber. 

For thin sections prepared for optical microcopy, the following steps were 

considered: (i) the specimens were compacted in the optimum compaction parameters 

(wopt and ydmax) determined in the modified Proctor test (Table 7.2); (ii) mixture 

specimens were cured in an acclimatized room for a period of seven days and after cure 

time were oven-dried at 50 °C for 24 hours; and (iii) after, specimens were impregnated 

with a resin mixture, using 450 mL of polyester resin, 550 mL styrene and 5 mL 

catalyser; polymerization was accomplished after 30 days in a ventilated room, followed 

by thin sectioning, using a diamond-powder polishing system. Thin sections were 

photographed in a Pentax camera fitted in a Olympus SZH binocular at plain light and 

magnified 15X. All microstructural descriptions followed the recommendations of 

Bullock et al. (1985). 



 

 123

With reference to SEM analyses, it was used small 1 cm3 compacted samples 

extracted from specimens compacted in the optimum parameters determined in 

compaction effort of standard and modified Proctor tests (Tables 7.1 and 7.2). It should 

be emphasized that the Brazilian standard and modified Proctor compaction tests are 

similar to the AASHTO standard and modified compaction tests. The samples were 

dried in a chamber at 50° C for 24 hours and fixed on aluminum stubs using double 

faced carbon adhesive tape. Next, a coating of approximately 20 nm of a palladium gold 

alloy was applied, using an FDU 010 model metalizer, manufactured by Balzers Inc., 

USA. The samples were observed under a VP 1430-type scanning electronic 

microscope, manufactured by LEO Electron Microscopy Oberkochen, Germany, that 

operated at 15 kV. The metalization and scanning electronic microscopy were both 

carried out at the Nucleus for Microscopic and Microanalysis (NMM) at the Federal 

University of Viçosa (UFV). 

The compaction tests were carried out following the methodology 

recommended by the ABNT (1986b), compacting the mixtures for between two to four 

hours after adding the stabilizer, following the usual procedures for soil-cement and 

soil-lime mixtures. Tables 7.1 and 7.2 show the optimum moisture content values (wopt) 

and maximum dry unit weight (?dmax) of the soils and their respective mixtures used in 

molding the specimens. Limits were fixed for specimen acceptance as proposed by the 

Brazilian National Highway Officials (DNER, 1994) in their preparation: maximum dry 

unit weight ± 0.30 kN/m3 and optimum moisture content ± 0.5%.

Microanalysis was performed in the samples used in the physicochemical 

analysis reported in item 7.2.2.2 of this paper. The samples of soils 1, 2 and 3 and their 

mixtures with 6% of stabilizer were fixed on aluminum stubs using double faced carbon 

adhesive tape. Next, a coating of carbon conductor film was applied using a Balt-Tec 

MED 020 metalizer. After sample preparation, photographs were taken using a SEM 

model JEOL JSM 6360-LV attached to a backscattering detector and energy dispersive 

X-ray spectrometer (EDS) with Si(Li) 10 mm2 detector, 136 eV energy resolution, 

manufactured by Thermo Electron Company. The analyses were performed at the 

Campinas State University (UNICAMP) Chemistry Institute, located in the city of 

Campinas, São Paulo state, Brazil. In the samples of soil 1 and its mixture prepared with 

6% of stabilizer were also performed microchemicals mapping from a 55 mm distance 

(surface-detector) at voltage of 20 kV and 5 A. After testing each sample the EDS was 

recalibrated using a copper standard. Microchemicals maps of selected particles were 

obtained considering the most important chemical elements present in the tested 

samples (Si, Al, Fe, S and Ca). EDS qualitative spectrums obtained from the analyses 

were recorded in a computer hard disk for quantitative determination of chemical 

composition of each tested sample using a Noran System SIX Corporation dedicated 

software that quantifies the percentages of each chemical element (Z &gt; 11) based on the 

hypothesis that they are in the oxide form. The results of the analysis were based in the 

average of 10 to 20 isolated determinations, as depicted in Figure 7.1.

7.3. Results and evaluation 

7.3.1. Physical and chemical properties of the soils and mixtures 

The physical and chemical characteristics of civil engineering construction 

materials must be known to classify them for their potential uses. To meet this 

requirement, physical and chemical characterization experiments were carried out on 

the materials under study. 

The results of the sieve and sedimentation analysis are presented in Figure 7.2. 

This figure shows the grain size distribution curves of the soils and their respective 

mixtures with the chemical additive studied and the quantities of the clay (? ? 

0.002 mm), silt (0.002 &amp;lt;? ? 0.06 mm) and sand (0.06 &amp;lt;? ? 2 mm) fractions defined by 

the grain size distribution scale proposed by the ABNT (1995). 

Comparison of the grain size distribution curves in Figure 7.2 shows that the 

chemical additive altered the original particle distribution of all soils. It is believed that 

the small particles in the soils agglutinated, forming larger sized flakes, as observed 

especially in soil 1 (Figure 7.2a) where, with the increase in the amount of additive, the 

percentage of the clay fraction decreased significantly and the silt and sand fractions 

increased. A small variation was observed in this performance in soils 2 and 3 (Figures 

7.2b and 7.2c, respectively), because with the increase in the additive content the 

percentage of the clay and silt fractions decreased but the sand fraction increased. When 

6% chemical additive was added to the soils, the percentages of particles smaller than 

0.002 mm decreased from 61%, 15% and 13% to 29%, 13% and 6%, respectively, in 

soils 1, 2 and 3, proving that the predominant reactions were those of flocculation, 

characteristic in clay surfaces with a high concentration of Ca2+ ions. This conclusion 

was reinforced by the observation that the modifications produced by the additive in the 

granular soils were more significant in soil 1, which consisted of 61% clay particles 

(particle diameter less than 0.002 mm).

The occurrence of significant grain size modifications in soils has been 

reported in the literature by Guimarães (1971), who detected significant changes in clay 

soils after adding lime at 3% and 5%, Osula (1996), who added 1%, 2% and 3% 

Portland cement and hydrated lime to a laterite, and Cristelo and Jalali (2004), who 

added 2% hydrated lime to two residual granite soils. 

In a recent paper on the determination of shear strength and elastic properties 

of soils-RBI Grade 81 mixtures via triaxial tests, Trindade et al. (2006b, 2006c) reported 

gains in the peak friction angle of specimens cured for seven days in a wet chamber and 

associated them to changes in grain size distributions due to flocculation/agglomeration 

and consequent increase in soils grain size. This assumption is confirmed by data 

presented in Figure 7.2. 

Tables 7.3 to 7.5 show the effects of increasing additive content on the grain 

unit weight (?s) of soils and mixtures. The addition of the stabilizer produced small 

alterations in the values of this parameter, as expected, because the product has ?s 

approximately equal 25 kN/m3 (ANYWAY, 2004), that is, a value close to those 

reported for soils without treatment. 

Regarding the consistency indices of the soils and mixtures, the data presented 

in Tables 7.3 to 7.5 show that generally there were slight increases in the plasticity limit 

values (PL) but reductions in the liquidity limit values (LL) and the plasticity Index (PI) 

of the soil with the increase in the quantity of chemical additive. The only combination 

that showed a reduction in PL compared to the natural soil was the mixture of soil 1 

with 6% additive. 

The changes in plasticity presented in Tables 7.3 to 7.5 suggest that there may 

have occurred not only cationic exchanges but also alterations in the structure of the fine 

soil particles via their flocculation and cementation. These results may reflect directly 

on the performance of these materials in the field, affecting aspects and parameters such 

as workability, swelling and compaction moisture. Similar conclusions are reported by 

Guimarães (1971), Transportation Research Board (TRB, 1976), Osula (1996), Çokça 

(2001) and Cristelo and Jalali (2004) where hydrated lime, Portland cement and fly ash 

were used as stabilizing agents.

An interesting characteristic of the RBI Grade 81 is that it is recommended to 

stabilize a wide range of soils, ranging from sand to plastic clay (ANYWAY, 2001). 

Thus, in a first analysis, it can be inferred that this stabilizer has elements in common 

with Portland cement and lime in its chemical composition. Hilt and Davidson (1960) 

analyzed the mechanical performance of clay soil and lime mixtures and considered the 

possibility of the existence of a limit condition at which, primarily, the stabilizer should 

meet the affinity of these soils to lime, defining it as its lime fixation capacities. In this 

study, these authors concluded that: (i) the addition of small quantities of lime to clay 

soils led to significant increases in net PL, and these were more expressive in soils rich 

in montmorillonite than those rich in kaolinite; (ii) the addition of amounts of lime 

lower than the soil fixation point can lead to significant changes in its workability, but 

not in its mechanical strength. 

Thus, when small quantities of lime are added to clay soils, significant 

variations occur in their PL, but inexpressive changes in the mechanical strength, 

because there is no lime available for significant pozzolanic reactions to take place; for 

larger quantities of additive, the PL tends to remain unaltered, verifying the availability 

of lime for pozzolanic reactions to take place that can lead, if they are reactive to lime, 

to significant variations in their mechanical strength. Thus the PL parameter can be 

considered a good indication of the lime fixation point of a soil. Similarly, Marks III 



 

 130

and Haliburton (1970) widened this discussion, understanding that the lime fixation 

point of a clay soil corresponds to the maximum compression condition of the diffuse 

double layer of its clay particles, and there is no later reduction in its plasticity, because 

the superficial charges of these particles reached a condition of equilibrium. Thus in this 

type of soil, there is a limit for plasticity reduction. In the present study, it was observed 

that modifications took place in the soil consistency indices with the addition of the 

stabilizer, and small falls in LL and slight increases in PL were observed, except in soil 

1, and a gradual fall in PI, that was more pronounced in soil 1 stabilized with 2% 

additive. When the concept of the lime fixation point was applied to the data in the 

present study, it was associated with the 2%, 6% and 4% contents, respectively to soils 

1, 2 and 3, as shown in Figure 7.3. However, this type of performance was not observed 

clearly and easily in the mixtures analyzed here.

The soil chemical characterization experiments have frequently been carried 

out in studies in the soil science field for fertilizer and nutrient replacement practices for 



 

 131

plant growth. Soils, for example, with high cationic exchange capacity are considered as 

being fertile. In the geotechnical area, these experiments have been carried out to assess, 

for example, the degree of soil weathering, soil potential for liner applications in 

environmental geotechnical engineering and the soil reaction potential to chemical 

stabilizers. 

Tables 7.3 to 7.5 show the results of the chemical characterization of the soils 

and soil-mixtures. The pH values, measured in water following the 1:2.5 volumetric 

soil:solution ratio of soils 1, 2 and 3 were, respectively, 6.1, 5.4 and 5.3, characterizing 

soil 1 as slightly acid and soils 2 and 3 as acid according to terminology by Guimarães 

(2002). According to van Raij et al. (1987) soil pH values are generally between 4 and 

7, and values below this range indicate the presence of free acids and values above this 

value indicate the presence of saline or limestone soils. The cationic exchange capacity 

(CEC) values in soils 1, 2 and 3 were relatively low and compatible with the mineralogy 

of their clay fractions, which were predominantly composed of kaolinite and iron and 

aluminum oxides, which are secondary minerals that have, respectively, CEC in the 

range from 3 to 15 cmolc/kg (GUIMARÃES, 1971) and 2 to 4 cmolc/kg (MEURER et 

al., 2004). Regarding the percentage base saturation (V%), soils 1, 2 and 3 presented 

values lower than 60%. According to Brady and Weil (1999), soils from tropical and 

wet regions, in which silicate clays predominate, are acid when V% is lower than 80%. 

Therefore the V% values are in line with the pH values determined and with the clay 

minerals present in the soils studied. The potential acidity (H+ + Al3+) values of soils 1, 

2 and 3 were, respectively, 0.99, 1.32 and 1.54, that is, they presented an inverse 

relationship with the pH values, showing that the potential acidity and consequently, 

some of the hydrogen and aluminum compounds influenced the pH means of the soils. 

Brady and Weil (1999) commented that the factors that account for soil acidity are 

complex, because there are two groups of dominant elements that exercise influence in 

the soil at the same time: acidity derives from aluminum and hydrogen while most of 

the other cations neutralize it. 

Tables 7.3 to 7.5 show that when the chemical additive was added to the soils 

there were significant increases in the value of the following chemical characteristics: 

pH, sum of exchangeable bases (SB) (mainly due to the increase in the Ca2+ ions), CEC 

and V%. In contrast, there was an expressive reduction in the quantity of free hydrogen 

and aluminum and the quantitative sums of H+ + Al3+ became nil after stabilizing the 



 

 132

soils with the additive under study. In short, the incorporation of the chemical stabilizer 

in the soils accounted for the increase in saturation of bases and for the total 

consumption of the exchangeable H+ + Al3+ ions, generating sharp modifications in the 

pH from acid to alkaline. 

Among the chemical characteristics assessed in the present study, the pH has 

been the most used in studies of soil chemical stabilization. It is known that increased 

pH causes the partial dissolution of mineral constituents of the soils generally followed 

by the formation of new silicates and aluminates, stable in the new conditions, which 

associate, forming a cement-like product capable of conferring high mechanical strength 

to the material (CHAUVEL and NÓBREGA, 1980). For instance, some studies sought 

to establish dosing criteria based on the pH values of the stabilized material, such as the 

classic study by Eades and Grim (1966) and recently the standard test method presented 

by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM, 1999). In these publications it 

is proposed a method to determine the ideal quantity of lime to stabilize a soil 

determining its lime reactivity level, which consisted of measuring the pH of the 

mixture after one hour. This value was then related to the quantity of lime consumed in 

the reactions in this time interval relating the optimum lime content to the smallest 

quantity of lime that raises the pH of the mixtures to 12.4. However, it is believed that 

dosage criteria based on the pH value that causes attack on the silica and aluminum 

present in the soil should be studied in depth, especially in the case of chemically 

stabilized tropical soils. Some studies carried out in tropical soils have reported that the 

addition of quantities from 2% to 5% Portland cement (PESSOA, 2004) and hydrated 

lime (LIMA, 1981; CARVALHO et al., 1981; PESSOA, 2004) was responsible for 

sharp increases in the pH, and values greater than 12.0 were observed. On the other 

hand, Rezende (2003) studied clay soils from the subgrade of two Brazilian highway 

experimental roads constructed in Brasilia-DF and did not observe pH values greater 

than 10.9 even after adding up to 6% hydrated lime. 

In the present study, it was verified that when 2% to 4% chemical additive was 

added to soils the pH value increased significantly, but more variations were observed at 

4% and 6% quantities and there was a slight tendency to stabilization in the pH values 

around 10.0, as shown in Figure 7.4. 

Based on the chemical equilibriums reported by Lindsay (1976), curves were 

constructed that represented the conditions which under silica and aluminum 



 

 133

solubilization in water takes place, in function of the pH values. Figure 7.4 shows that in 

the soils the aluminum was practically insoluble and the silica presented solubility 

between 25 and 30 cmol/L, but with the addition of 6% chemical additive the 

solubilities of silica and aluminum raised to, respectively, 65 and 50 cmol/L in soils 1 

and 2. In the case of soil 3, when the pH reached 10.0, silica presented solubility about 

75 cmol/L and aluminum was totally soluble.

7.3.2. Mineralogical characterization of soils and mixtures 

Most of chemical reactions between soil and chemical stabilizer are soil 

minerals dependent, and identification of mineral type in the soil different fractions is 

mandatory to soil stabilization studies to understand the process as a whole. Therefore, 

the kinds of minerals present after the soil stabilization can become a good tool for 

diagnosis on the soil behavior, which could complement the studies involving the 

physical and chemical characteristics of the final product after stabilization.

Figures 7.5 and 7.6 show data from XRD (X-ray diffraction) analyses 

performed on soil samples 1, 2 and 3 and theirs 7-days curing mixtures with 2%, 4% 

and 6% RBI Grade 81 contents. Samples were prepared using soils sand (? 53 ?m) and 

silt-clay (&amp;lt;53 ?m) fractions. Tables 7.6 and 7.7 show values of peak intensity of the 

minerals identified in each of the tested soils and mixtures. 

Sand fractions for soil samples 1, 2 e 3 and their admixtures are very similar 

and present, essentially, quartz that was identified by peaks corresponding to d’s 

(atomic interplanar distance) 0.43, 0.33, 0.25 and 0.23 nm (GRIM, 1968; MOORE and 

REYNOLDS JR., 1989). In the sand fraction of soil 3 and its mixtures it was identified 

K-feldspars due to peaks obtained at 0.32 nm (GRIM, 1968; MOORE and REYNOLDS 

JR., 1989). Additionally to quartz and feldspar, also were detected peaks that allowed to 

identify kaolinite (0.72 and 0.36 nm) in the sand fractions of soils 2 and 3 and their 

admixtures. The presence of kaolinite in these samples can be associated to the 

pseudomorphs inherited from the weathering of feldspar or muscovite that are 

commonly found in these soils, as related by Pinto et al. (1972). The Figure 7.7 presents 

an example of the kaolinite in mica pseudomorphics forms found in soils 2 and 3. From 

the data presented in Figure 7.5 and Table 7.6, it can be seen that there was a 

progressive decrease in the intensity of the peaks from quartz and feldspars detected in 

? 53 ?m fraction at the same time that there was an increase in the chemical stabilizer 

content, showing that stabilization process was destroying part of these minerals 

through of the short- and medium-term chemical reactions that have been developed. 

The XRD patterns presented in Figure 7.6 show the silt-clay fraction of all soil 

samples and their mixtures. They show that kaolinite, quartz and goethite, identified by 

their peaks of d’s equal to 0.72, 0.33 and 0.42 nm, respectively, appeared in all 

&amp;lt;0.53 ?m fractions of soil samples and its mixtures. In samples from soils 1 and 2 and 

its mixtures was detected gibbsite (d = 0.49 nm). From peaks at positions corresponding 

to d = 1.00 nm and d = 0.50 nm it was possible to determine the presence of mica in soil 

samples 2 and 3 and their mixtures.

From the analyses of the XRD patterns presented in Figures 7.5 and 7.6, it can 

be observed that when the chemical stabilizer was added new minerals phases were 

formed and they were identified. In the silt-clay fraction of mixtures from soil samples 1 

and 2 it was noticed the presence of portlandite which is a calcium hydroxide 

(d = 0.26 nm). Rankinite, calcium silicate, was identified by its peaks positions 

corresponding to a d = 0.30 nm (EADES and GRIM, 1960; EADES et al., 1962) and it 

was found in most of the mixtures, exception in the ? 53 ?m fraction of mixtures from 

soil samples 1 and 2 (Figure 7.5). Intense and well defined peaks showed that the 

mixtures, after seven days cure time, showed the formation of a significant amount of 

calcium silicate, mainly in the finer fractions. It was also observed that with the 

increasing of chemical additive contents, the peaks for rankinite also increased 

indicating a larger formation of cementing compounds associated to the 6% content of 

RBI Grade 81. 

The rankinite, calcium silicate, is a typical product of hydration reactions of the 

tricalcium silicate (C3S or 3CaOSiO2) portland cement (NOBLE, 1967; PETRUCCI, 

1998) and from pozzolanic reactions between silica (SiO2) and calcium oxide (CaO) in 

soil-lime mixtures (EADES and GRIM, 1960; EADES et al., 1962; SRINIVASAN, 

1967; GUIMARÃES, 1971; TRB, 1976; CHAUVEL and NÓBREGA, 1980; LIMA, 

1981; CARVALHO et al., 1981). The portlandite [Ca(OH)2] is a mineral phase present 

in the RBI Grade 81 (Figure 7.8), which indicates that in soil samples 1 and 2 the 

reactions between this mineral and the soil minerals didn’t occur completely, being 

necessary a long-term to produce all the reactions. These observations are corroborated 



 

 138

by the data presented by Trindade et al. (2006a, 2006b, 2006c), who, when studying the 

effect of the RBI Grade 81 addition in the mechanical properties of soils 1, 2 and 3, 

verified that the higher increases in CBR, unconfined compressive strength, tensile 

strength and shear strength were associated to soil 3.

Similary to the observed in the soils sand fractions, from the data presented in

intensities of all mineral phases originally presents (kaolinite, gibbsite, goethite, quartz 

and mica) in the silt-clay fraction of soils 1, 2 and 3, with increasing of chemical 

stabilizer contents. This reinforces the idea that the chemical stabilization process was 

responsible by consumption part of soil minerals through of the chemical reactions with 

RBI Grade 81. This hypothesis also presented by Eades et al. (1962), in soil-lime 

stabilization case, and Noble (1967), in a soil-cement stabilization study, which 

associated the decreasing in peak intensities of soil minerals to consumption of these 

minerals, principally the aluminosilicates, though of reactions with constituents of 

chemical stabilizers studied.

7.3.3. Microstructural characterization of soils and mixtures 

In stabilization studies of tropical soils, although there are many data of interest 

on geotechnical properties of these materials, there is very little information at the 

microscopic level, including aspects such as structural reorganization, compaction and 

particle cementing, which could offer interesting input for the study of the technical 

performance of the mixtures. Among the methods available for this purpose, scanning 

electronic microscopy has been much used to study the microstructure of compacted 

and chemically stabilized soils, because, according to Pessoa (2004), both compaction 



 

 140

and cationic exchanges and chemical reactions are capable of causing structural 

rearrangements. 

In the scanning electronic microscope (SEM) an electron beam accelerated by 

an electric field is directed, through a vacuum of 1.33x10-6 kPa, to the surface of the 

sample to be observed. As the result of the interaction of the electrons beam with the 

sample surface, there is the emission of a series of radiations, including secondary 

electrons, backscattered electrons, X-rays, Auger electrons, and photons. When 

correctly captured, these radiations give characteristic data on the sample analyzed, 

including surface topography, composition and crystallography. 

In scanning electronic microscopy, the signals of greatest interest for image 

formation are the secondary and backscattered electrons. As the primary electron beam 

scans the sample, these signals are modified according to variations in the surface. The 

secondary electrons supply images of the sample surface topography and obtain the 

high-resolution images, while the backscattered electrons give an image characteristic 

of the variation of the components due to their differences in anatomic densities, where 

the elements with greater densities present greater brilliance. Depending on the material 

analyzed, the magnification can reach 900,000 times, but for the analysis of materials 

commonly used in civil construction, the maximum increase used is 10,000 times. 

Initially, the microstructure was characterized from an analysis of the 

secondary electron images obtained in SEM. Samples from soils 1, 2 and 3 and their 

mixtures with 6% chemical additive compacted under the optimum conditions (wopt and 

?dmax) at the standard and modified Proctor test were analyzed and the images are 

shown, respectively, in Figures 7.9 and 7.10. 

It was observed from the sets of images presented in these figures that the 

volume of soil 1 was taken up predominantly by plasma that formed a continuous phase 

and in some cases, was presented in the form of spherical micro-aggregates joined 

together. These micro-aggregates were formed by a very fine particles, randomly 

placed, formed by assemblies of kaolinite and gibbsite minerals wrapped and cemented 

by iron oxyhydroxides responsible for the stability of their organization. On the other 

hand, it was observed that the predominance of the plasma compared to the skeleton 

greatly decreased in soils 2 and 3, and in this last material there were 100 to 500 ?m 

quartz grains with little, or practically no, quantity of fine material filling the gaps.

respectively, soils 1, 2 and 3 with 6% of chemical stabilizer. 

 
The effects of the increase in the compaction effort, from the standard Proctor 

test to the modified Proctor test, were clearly visible in soils 1, 2 and 3. Figures 7.9 and 

7.10 show that the quartz grains, present in large quantities in soils 2 and 3, were broken 



 

 143

after the increase in compaction effort, forming finer and less porous materials. In soil 

1, it was observed that after the increase in compaction effort very fine crack gaps arose 

(0.1 to 10 ?m), close to each other and placed perpendicularly to the compaction axle. 

Figures 7.9a and 7.10a show that these cracks were limited by a paler colored clay film, 

called stress cutan, according to terminology adopted by Brewer (1976). According to 

Carvalho et al. (1981), the application of a great compaction effort is not always the best 

treatment to attain high mechanical strength, and it can lead to the complete destruction 

of the microstructure of the material, that is sometimes naturally stable, as in the case of 

the latosols. 

Regarding the microstructure of the stabilized soils, Figures 7.9 and 7.10 show 

that the chemical additive used accounted for the formation of cementation nuclei 

among the soil micro-aggregates. These nuclei were more obvious in the soil 3 mixtures 

(Figures 9f and 10f), where there seems to have been SiO2 and Al2O3 solubilization, 

forming a gel (calcium silicate and/or aluminates) that, after consolidation, cemented 

the surrounding particles, conglomerating them (EADES and GRIM, 1960; EADES et 

al., 1962; NOBLE, 1967). In the soil 1 mixtures the addition of the additive conserved 

the continuous microstructure (Figures 9b and 10b), resulting from the coalescence of 

the micro-aggregates; however it prevented the formation of plasma orientations and 

empty cracks, responsible for the lamellation of soil 1 without treatment after applying 

the high compacting effort, as was the case of the use of the modified Proctor test. 

The analysis of the microstructure of the material compacted after adding the 

chemical additive also explained the results of the grain size distribution analyses 

presented in item 7.3.1, where the stabilized soils presented a greater quantity of sand 

compared to the untreated soils. Figures 7.9 and 7.10 show that after soil stabilization 

the micro-aggregates linked by the cementing nuclei performed as highly stable grains, 

capable of resisting all the processes used in the grain size distribution test together to 

disperse the soil particles. 

In addition to SEM analysis, the microstructure of soil samples 1, 2 and 3 and 

of theirs admixtures with 6% of RBI Grade 81 were described using optical microscopy 

(OM) performed in specimens compacted at the modified Proctor compaction effort. 

Optical microscopy is rarely used in soil mechanics studies in Brazil and elsewhere, 

although it provides one of the simplest and less expensive techniques to study the 

development of microstructures of soil mixtures, reaching resolutions down to 200 ?m. 



 

 144

Figure 7.11a shows that compaction of soil 1 created a clear tendency to 

packing and virtual coalescence of the ovoidal micro-aggregates, welded face-to-face, 

turning the soil mass in a higher cohesive structure and forming a typical structure 

observed in compacted kaolinite latosols (SCHAEFER, 2001). Color was mainly red-

dark, different from the yellowish-red color observed in undisturbed soil samples, as 

reported by Azevedo (1999). The quartz grains in soil 1 were less abundant than the 

micro-aggregates, with grain size ranging from 0.05 to 2 mm and, usually, with 

subangular to angular shapes and not oriented. In some cases compaction resulted in a 

breaking or fracturing of quartz, however most grains were unaffected. Also, the 

compaction effort created a fissured structure along the lines of particle weaknesses, 

filled by fine interstitial plasma without apparent orientation. 

Similarly to the observed in SEM images, the addition of 6% of chemical 

stabilizer to soil 1 produced significant reduction of its fissure formation pattern 

(Figure 7.11b), and all remaining voids were filled by a fine yellowish-red material. 

This material was probably a mixture of the partially solubilized oxides in high pH 

resulting from the stabilizer addition. 

Soils 2 and 3 present an organization of plasma-skeleton of the granoic type, 

exhibit small portions with agglomeroplasmatic type, in which no clay aggregates occur 

(Figures 7.11c and 7.11e). The nodules are common and typically pseudomorphic, 

showing subrounded smoothed grain, without fracturing and lacking orientation. 

Structural elements are linked through clay bridges or are embedded in the scarce 

plasma. In these soils, compaction led to an extreme reduction of structural voids, 

mainly presenting small channels and chambers and, less commonly, in the form of 

packing voids. The quartz grains are dominant in soils 2 and 3. In the case of the soil 2, 

the grains are small, subrounded to subangular, with average size of 0.2 mm 

(Figure 7.11c). On the other hand, quartz and feldspar grains in soil 3 are considerably 

larger, with average size of 0.5 mm, with a considerable amount of quartz grains bigger 

than 1 mm (Figure 7.11e). These showed little fracturing and no evidence of corroded 

surfaces.

respectively, soils 1, 2 and 3; (b), (d) and (f), respectively, soils 1, 2 and 3 with 6% of 
chemical stabilizer. 

 
Undisturbed samples of soils 2 and 3 present kaolinite pseudomorphs after 

mica dispersed in the soils masses, as described by Azevedo (1999). According to this 



 

 146

author, compaction effort promoted repacking and reorientation of these pseudomorphs 

forming horizontal lines parallel to the specimen’s surface, and normal to the direction 

of the applied compaction effort. 

Regarding the mixtures of soils 2 and 3 stabilized with 6% of RBI Grade 81, 

the images presented in Figures 7.11d and 7.11f are consistent with SEM observations. 

Mainly in soil 3, it was observed that quartz and feldspar grains were mostly destroyed 

and solubilized, and the few remaining grains became fractured after the soil 

stabilization process. The solubilized material formed a sort of cementing gel that 

involved the micro-aggregates, pseudomorphs and remaining grains, forming a 

structurally dense soil mass, highly resistant. 

In the soil 3 mixture it was also possible to identify the formation of a red to 

yellow cementing material (Figure 7.11f) that is, probably, constituted by the same 

material that filled out the fine crack gaps of soil 1 after its chemical stabilization. 

Although not having observed through the analyses of XRD presented in Figures 7.5 

and 7.6 the formation of others minerals besides the rankinite (3CaO.2SiO2), it is 

believed that the yellow to red cementing material is formed starting from the reaction 

of the calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] present in RBI Grade 81 (Figure 7.8) together with 

the iron and aluminum oxides (respectively, Fe2O3 and Al2O3) present in the soils, 

creating the 4CaO.Al2O3.Fe2O3, also known as the C4F commonly found in the 

constitution of the Portland cements. 

To complement the results of the present study, a specific study was directed to 

the qualitative and semiquantitative determination of the presence of chemical elements 

in the soils and in their mixtures using the microanalysis technique. 

The microanalysis is one of the most important instruments for the chemical 

analysis of organic and inorganic materials. Through the identification of the X-ray 

emitted by the sample, when of the interaction with the electrons beam, it is possible to 

determine the composition of areas over 1 µm of diameter. It is a non-destructive 

technique that can determine amounts from 0.1% of present elements in the sample, 

since Z &gt; 11 in the case of EDS (energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer) and Z &gt; 4 in the 

case of WDS (wavelength dispersive X-ray spectrometer). It should be pointed out that 

in the EDS technique presence of the carbon element can be related to the coating of the 

carbon conductor film applied over the sample before testing. In the present research it 



 

 147

was used a EDS probe and Figures 7.12 and 7.13 show data of soils 1, 2 and 3 and of 

theirs mixtures with 6% of RBI Grade 81.

The EDS spectrums presented in Figure 7.12 shows that the soils 1, 2 and 3 are 

constituted, basically, by Al, Si and Fe. However, other elements were also detected in 

smaller amounts, as it is the case of Na, Mg, K and Ti. It should be referred that the 

elements Na and K were just found in the soils 2 and 3 (Figures 7.12b and 7.12c) being 

associated to the K-feldspar and mica mineral groups as illustrated in Figures 7.5 and 

7.6. The largest amount of Fe was determined in soil 1 (Figure 7.12a), a yellowish-red 

latosol with reasonable goethite presence (Figure 7.6). Great amounts of Al and Si were 

encountered, probably, associated to the minerals kaolinite and quartz which are the 

most abundant in the three analyzed soils. 

From the ESD spectrums illustrated in Figure 7.13, it was also verified the 

main elements found in the mixtures of the soils 1, 2 and 3 with 6% of RBI Grade 81 

that most important elements present are Al, Si, Ca and S. But Mg, P, K, Mn, Ti and Fe 

were also detected in smaller amounts. 

Also, microchemical analysis were performed to quantify the cementation 

process created by addition of 6% of stabilizer to the soil 1, furnishing semiquantitatives 

microchemical charts of this soil and its mixture (Figure 7.14). 

The data presented in Figure 7.14c are in agreement with those from the 

microanalysis (Figure 7.12a), and show that the soil 1 is constituted basically by Si, Al 

and Fe oxides. From the data presented in Figure 7.14d it can be observed that in the 

mixture of the soil 1 with 6% of RBI Grade 81are detected, also, Ca and S that are 

concentrated in the areas of assembly of crystals. In these areas, together with the Ca 

and S, it is verified presence of an expressive amount of O, Al and Si. 

The micro-aggregates in the form of small sticks presented in Figure 7.14b and 

7.14d, probably, are constituted by bassanite or gypsum [CaSO4(0.5H2O)], which is also 

a material present in the RBI Grade 81 (Figure 7.8). Other minerals that, probably, were 

formed in the stabilization process of soil 1 were the calcium, aluminum and iron 

silicates and the sulfoaluminate, that is a solid element that lodges in the pores of the 

soil mass turning them more compact, since there is not excess of calcium oxide 

dissolved in the interstitial water that, in contact with the sulfoaluminate, can create the 

ettringite (hydrated calcium aluminum sulfate hydroxide), which is an extremely 

expansible and very common mineral in the reactions between soils rich in sulfates with 

the Portland cements (ROLLINGS et al., 1999).

7.4. Conclusions 

• The chemical additive altered the grain size distribution of the soils. Fine 
particles were coalesced forming larger flakes; with tend to be granular with 

increasing additive content. These changes in grain size distribution are 

illustrated at SEM scale (secondary electron images presented in Figs. 7.9 

and 7.10) showing the formation of a granular microstructure by welding of 

smaller particles with a cementing agent. 

• Increasing chemical additive content generally caused slight increases in the 
PL values and decreases in the LL and PI values, as well produced small 

alterations in the grain unit weight of all studied soils. 

• The chemical additive was responsible for significant increase in pH and 
CEC, with sharp reductions in the potential acidity of the soils. The pH of 

the mixtures reached values of 10.0, forming greater silica and aluminum 

solublization in the soil, resulting in the formation of calcium silicates and 

aluminates. These silicates are the compounds responsible for the 

mechanical strength and durability of concrete from Portland cement 

(EADES et al., 1962). It is postulated that the inter-particle cementing 

matrix formed after stabilization with RBI Grade 81 is very strong and 

stable, and maybe be very durable. 

• The OM and SEM analyses showed that increasing compaction effort 
accounted for the appearance of fractures along the surfaces, unconnected 

cracking voids in the clayey plasma (soil 1) and breaking of the quartz 

grains (soils 2 and 3). However, the latter effect was minimized with the 

addition of the chemical additive to the soils that caused the formation of 

highly visible cementing nuclei, especially in the soil 3 mixtures. 

• Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) analyses indicated that 
contents of Si and Al oxides in soils decrease after chemical stabilization, 

probably by solubilization of these oxides and Ca silicates and aluminates 

formation during hydration and/or pozzolanic reactions of chemical 

stabilizer with soils. 



 

 152

• With reference to mineralogy, the chemical stabilizer addition resulted in 
peak reduction of all clay minerals and the formation of rankinite, a Ca-

silicate in a well-crystalline form, easily identified by X-ray diffraction, 

strengthening the conclusions gotten from the EDS analyses.
