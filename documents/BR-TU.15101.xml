Abstract

This work was carried out during one year in a fish pond to evaluate the effect of water quality in a plankton community 
according to the adopted management. High densities of Euglenophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Cyanobacteria were 
associated with high nitrate levels (1 to 210 mg.L–1). Cell densities of Cyanobacteria over 90 ind.m3 × 103 (85.5%) 
occurred when nitrate concentrations approximated 210 mg.L–1, total phosphorus less than 160 mg.L–1 and temperature 
above 25 °C. High density of Rotifera was associated with high density of Cyanobacteria (December). Only 
Trichocerca sp. among the Rotifera species was constant in all sampled sites, whereas Diaphanosoma birgei, ranging 
between 4 and 342 ind.L–1 (0.7 and 2.4%) during the study period, was the most representative among the Cladocera 
species. Results show that water quality management in the fish pond had a direct influence on the plankton population 
due to the shallowness of the environment, large nutrient discharges through feed, fertilizing, fish waste. In fact, they 
contribute towards the appearance of undesirable plankton organisms.

Keywords: fishpond, phytoplankton, zooplankton, limnology, environment management.

Qualidade da água e população planctônica em viveiro de policultivo de peixe

Resumo

O presente estudo foi realizado durante um ano em viveiro de produção de peixes, com a finalidade de avaliar o efeito da 
qualidade da água na comunidade planctônica em função do manejo adotado. Maiores densidades de Euglenophyceae, 
Chlorophyceae e Cyanobacteria estiveram associadas aos elevados teores de nitrato (1 a 210 mg.L–1). Densidades de 
Cyanobacteria acima de 90 ind.m3 × 103 (85,5%) ocorreram quando as concentrações de nitrato estiveram ao redor 
de 210 mg.L–1, fósforo total menor que 106 mg.L–1 e temperatura acima de 25 °C. Elevada densidade de Rotifera 
também esteve associada às altas densidades de Cyanobacteria (dezembro). Dentre os organismos zooplanctônicos, 
os Rotifera foram os mais abundantes e somente Trichocerca sp. foi constante em todos os pontos amostrados. Dentre 
os Cladocera, a espécie mais representativa foi Diaphanosoma birgei, variando de 4 a 342 ind.L–1 (0,7 e 2,4%) durante 
o período de estudo. Os resultados mostram que qualidade da água e o manejo empregado neste viveiro apresentaram 
influência direta na população planctônica, em função da baixa profundidade e constante carga de nutrientes que são 
incorporados no viveiro por meio de alimentos, fertilizantes e fezes de peixes, que contribuem para o aparecimento 
de organismos planctônicos não desejáveis.

1. Introduction

One of the main causes of water quality deterioration 
is fish pond management. The daily addition of food and 
fertilization for plankton growth, with a subsequent increase 
in nutrient rates in the water column, are always required 
for fish development.

To fill a fish pond, water may come from several 
sources such as wells, creaks, rivers, reservoirs or other 
natural sources. Water may either pass through the pond 
and be discharged or it may be partially retained. Water 
also contains nutrients, which can stimulate the growth 
of plankton population, aquatic plants and may also 
contain great amounts of organic and inorganic matter, 
which influence water quality of the pond (Adeoye et al., 
2009). Furthermore, the feed given daily to fish may not be 
directly consumed by fish species but may be leached into 
the pond, affecting all levels of nutrient availability and 
plankton growth in such systems (Ferdoushi et al., 2008).

Regular fertilization in fish ponds accumulates nutrients 
at the bottom of the water body. The most limiting nutrients 
for the plankton population are nitrogen and phosphorus, 
and the main source of such substances in fish ponds are 
fish excretion, the protein level in food and release from 
the sediment. In fact, decomposition of organic matter 
produces ammonia, which diffuses from sediment to 
the water column (Hargreaves and Tucker, 2004). High 
nutrient load and production accumulate organic matter 
at the bottom sediment which maintains high internal 
loading (Pokorný and Hauser, 2002).

There is a direct relationship between nutrients and 
phytoplankton density and species diversity. Chowdhury et al. 
(2007) observed low abundance of phytoplankton in 
low temperature and nitrate concentration, although 
phosphate exhibited an inverse relationship with the 
growth rate of planktonic organisms. Recent studies have 
suggested phosphorus as the most limiting nutrient with 
regard to phytoplankton. As a rule, affinity constants for 
orthophosphate by Cyanobacteria occurred (Moutin et al., 
2002; Tanaka et al., 2004).

Nutrients increase is readily incorporated into the 
plankton community and ultimately into the fish biomass. 
Several studies (Naz and Turkemen, 2005; Arimoro et al., 
2008; Shan et al., 2008) have reported higher densities 
of plankton (mainly phytoplankton) during the rainy 
season owing to the fact that rains carry allochthonous 
nutrients from the drainage basin as well as mixing of 
the autochthonous material. Primary production and 
consequently phytoplankton production and abundance are 
accelerated (Basualto et al., 2006; Arimoro et al., 2008).

Plankton biomass and composition in shallow water 
bodies fluctuate as a reaction to several interacting driving 
forces which may include polymixis, water-level changes, 
weather conditions, nutrients loading and feeding management 
(Borics et al., 2000).

In the case of aquaculture, the maintenance of good 
water quality is of primary importance so that excellent 
culture environment, adequate feed for optimal fish yield 

potential, appraisal of the eutrophic situation and increase in 
plankton population may be achieved. This is because fish 
pond systems are affected by temporal changes which may 
cause fluctuations in planktonic population composition and 
assemblage. Therefore, the present investigation aims at 
analysing the occurrence and abundance of phytoplankton 
and zooplankton in a fish pond and their relationship with 
limnological variables.

2. Material and Methods

2.1. Study area and sampling sites

Current research was carried out at the Aquaculture 
Center (21° 14’ 05” S and 48° 17’ 09” W), at the Universidade 
Estadual Paulista (UNESP), Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil, in a 
fish pond with continuous water flow which provides a 
daily exchange of 5% of volume. According to the Köpen 
classification, the region’s climate is Cwa, subtropical, 
relatively dry in the winter (June to September) and rainy 
in the summer (October to March), with mean yearly 
temperature of 22 °C and at mean of altitude 605 m. The 
fish pond surface area is 2,036 m2 and the mean depth is 
1.30 m. The fish pond was populated with the fish species 
Piaractus mesopotamicus (“pacu”), Colossoma macropomum 
(“tambaqui”), Pseudoplatystoma corruscan (“pintado”) and 
Brycon cephalus (“matrinxã”) breeders. The total number of 
fishes was three hundred. Fish were fed with a supplementary 
diet containing 28% crude protein. Samples for abiotic and 
biotic variables determination were undertaken monthly, 
from December 2007 to November 2008. Water samples 
were collected at six sampling sites: P

1
 = back water area; 

P
2
 = outlet water; P

3
 = deep water site; P

4
 = inlet water from 

6 fish ponds of 80 m2; P
5
 = inlet water from 11 fish ponds 

of 50 m2, and P
6
 = inlet water from of water supply fish 

pond, ornamental fish lab and four fish ponds of 200 m2, 
where the macrophyte stand lies (Figure 1).

2.2. Plankton

Sampling for plankton was done using a Van Dorn 
bottle filtering a volume of 5 L for phytoplankton and 10 L 
to zooplankton. The plankton samples were filtered with 
25 and 58 mm mesh nets, and preserved in Lugol iodine 
solution and formalin (4%), respectively, for phytoplankton 
and zooplankton. Numerical densities data were expressed 
as ind.m3 × 103, ind.L–1, and percentage abundance (%). The 
concentrated preserved plankton samples were analysed 
using a Sedgewick-Rafter counting cell and examined 
under 100 × magnification. Cladocera and Copepoda, 
were counted in a reticulated chamber. Approximately 
four hundred individuals of the most abundant species 
were registered, with an approximate 10% precision, 
and a 95% confidence interval (Bicudo and Bicudo, 
2004). Frequency of occurrence was estimated for total 
phytoplankton and zooplankton organisms were divided 
into three categories: constant (50% or above); common 
(between 10% and 50%) and rare (between 1 and 10%) 
(Sampaio et al., 2002).

2.3. Limnological variables

Water samples were collected at 0.10 m depth. 
Transparency was measured using a Secchi disk, temperature 
dissolved oxygen and pH were taken with a multiparametric 
probe (Horiba U-10), chlorophyll-a was evaluated according 
to Nusch (1980), nutrients according to Koroleff (1976) 
and Golterman et al. (1978). All samples were transported 
to the laboratory in cold boxes.

2.4. Statistical analysis

Two-way ANOVA was used for physical and chemical 
parameters in order to compare sites and months, and 
their interactions, with significance level of p &amp;lt;0.05 
(Fowler et al., 1998). Pearson’s correlation (p &amp;lt;0.05) was 
used to find out the levels of significance of relationship 
between groups of phytoplankton and zooplankton and 
environmental variables, by using the Statistic 6.0 program. 

Sites were grouped by cluster analysis (unweighted pair 
group average linkage, UPGMA) based on the Bray Curtis 
index, using abundance log

10
 (x + 1) transformed data of 

all plankton (Magurran, 1989).

3. Results

Although a significant difference (p &amp;lt;0.05) was 
observed between months, no significant difference 
(p &gt; 0.05) was reported between sites when comparing 
orthophosphate, nitrate and total phosphorus (TP). By 
contrast, ammonia levels showed significant difference 
(p &amp;lt;0.05) between sites, but no difference (p &gt; 0.05) 
between months. Dissolved oxygen values varied from 
3.0 to 7.3 mg.L–1 with differences (p &amp;lt;0.05) between 
sites and months. Although TP in the water column was 
not high; the highest values were reported in October 
at P

2
 (159 mg.L–1). TP and orthophosphate fluctuation 

rates were similar to those of the highest concentrations 
reported between June through October. Since during the 
same period the lowest values were registered with the 
highest phytoplankton cell densities in the water, there 
was an inverse relationship between orthophosphate and 
the different phytoplanktonic groups (Figures 2 and 3).

The Bacillariophyceae group, abundant throughout 
the study period, was the only exception (Figures 3). High 
nitrate rates, ranging between 1 and 210 mg.L–1, were 
reported between December and March when the highest 
cell densities for Euglenophyceae, Chlorophyceae and 
Cyanobacteria occurred. The Zygnematophyceae group 
had the highest cell densities in June with 288 ind.m3 × 103 
(76%) when TP and orthophosphate concentrations in the 
water column were high. Nitrate concentration was highest 
at P

1
 (210 mg.L–1) and TP was lower than 106 mg.L–1, with 

Cyanobacteria cell densities above 90 ind.m3 × 103, associated 
with high temperatures (&gt;25 °C) (Figures 2 and 3; Table 1).

Furthermore, pH was alkaline throughout the research 
varying between 7.2 and 8.7, except in October at P

3
, when 

those values reached 9.9. This fact coincided with high 
ammonia concentration (175 mg.L–1) during the whole 
study period, which were more associated with fish feeding 
management (diet addition). There were no significant 
differences in pH values (p &gt; 0.05) between sites and 
months. Chlorophyll-a values varied from 3 to 56 mg.L–1 
and were not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05) between 
sites and months (Figures 2 and 4). A sudden fall in 
temperature in July directly affected some phytoplanktonic 
populations with Chlorophyceae, Zygnematophyceae, and 
Euglenophyceae. Copepoda and Bacillariophyceae were 
also affected (Figures 3 and 5; Table 1). Transparency 
was directly related to the fall in temperature values and 
to the phytoplankton community higher density in July, 
ranging between 0.7 and 0.9 m among the sampled sites. 
Transparency and temperature values were significantly 
different (p &amp;lt;0.05) between sites during the year. As a 
rule dissolved oxygen was above 4 mg.L–1, with significant 
differences between sites and months (p &amp;lt;0.01), and 
inverse relation with temperature (Figure 4).

The phytoplankton community consisted of 35 taxa 
during the period under analysis. The Bacillariophyceae group 
was the most representative, followed by Chlorophyceae, 
Zygnematophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Cyanobacteria and 
Oedogonophyceae. The species Oedogonium sp., reported 
at P

5
 with a density of 20 ind.m3 × 103 during December 

2007, represented the latter (Table 2). Few phytoplanktonics 
species were constant (13 species), with occurrence reported 
at P

1
, P

2
 and P

4
. The first site had the largest number of 

constant species (Table 2).
The zooplankton community consisted of 24 taxa, or 

rather, 4 Cladocera, 2 Copepoda and 18 Rotifera. Copepoda 
species were constant or common at the sampled sites 
throughout the period, excepting P

3
. Only Trichocerca sp. 

among Rotifera species were constant in all sampled 
sites, whereas Diaphanosoma birgei, ranging between 
4 and 342 ind.L–1 (0.7 and 2.4%) during the study period, 
was the most representative among the Cladocera species 

(Table 3). Zooplankton species were more abundant during 
the rainy period (December through March) when the high 
fish diet increase rate and nutrient availability (mainly nitrates) 
occurred. In fact, high phytoplankton density as food for 
zooplankton was available. High rates of Cyanobacteria in 
December at P

1
 did not influence Rotifera and Copepoda 

density at this site (Figures 3 and 5; Table 1).
Similarity analyses for plankton densities showed the 

formation of three groups, P
3
 and P

2
 sites were markedly 

different from the rest with regard to phytoplankton and 
zooplankton, respectively (Figure 6).

4. Discussion

Fish pond morphometry and management mainly 
enhanced fast nutrient increase during the fish growing 
period which occurred during the rainy period in the 
southeastern region of Brazil. The amount of organic and 
inorganic load, introduced in the fish pond and originating

from the effluents of other ponds, coupled to the diet given 
to fish, directly affected water quality, which could be seen 
through the fluctuations in its biotic and abiotic variables. 
Diversity of the plankton population is fairly dependent 
on water quality and climatic factors.

High nitrate concentrations occurring between December 
and May directly affected zooplankton densities. This 
might be due to the fact that increase in nitrogen inflow 
stimulates the zooplankton community (Mischke and 
Zimba, 2009). Nitrate is found in well-oxygenated waters 
and its variability is due to biological activity (Neofitou and 

Figure 4. Monthly variation of transparency, pH, 
 chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen and temperature at water 
column of samples sites (P

) during the studied period. 

Figure 5. Relative abundance (%) of zooplankton groups

) during 

the studied period.

Klaoudatos, 2008). The above was confirmed in current 
research since high nitrate concentrations, when compared 
with other nutrients (TP, orthophosphate and ammonia), 
may be associated with dissolved oxygen above 4 mg.L–1 
and the continuous water flow which is heightened during 
the summer when heavy rains occur.

Ammonia nitrogen is the most important and readily 
available nitrogen source for phytoplankton. In the current 
study, ammonia concentrations were lower than 135 mg.L–1 
(except in P

3
 in October), probably due to the fast ammonia 

uptake by phytoplankton, mainly by Bacillariophyceae 
species, with high cell densities at most sampled sites 
throughout the whole studied period. The relatively low 
ammonia concentrations between November and December 
(summer) may be attributed the competitive advantage for 
Cyanobacteria due to high affinity ammonium uptake. Low 
ammonia concentration between May and July (winter) 
is associated with the cyclic feeding regimes (periods of 
feed deprivation followed by re-feeding) in fish production

attempt to mimic the natural fluctuation in prey availability 
and trigger compensatory growth (Turano et al., 2008).

Euglenophyceae and Cyanobacteria are common groups 
in small eutrophic water bodies such as fish ponds, oxbow, 
slow flowing canals (Borics et al., 2000). The cyanobacteria 
group has a better development in warm temperatures, 
high light intensity and high levels of phosphorus and 
nitrogen. Since phosphorus and nitrogen are commonly 
found in fertilizers used in fish ponds and relatively high 
temperatures are favourable conditions for the growth of 
Cyanobacteria (Rahman and Jewel, 2008), the taxon was 
dominant at temperatures above 20 °C, alkaline pH and 
high nutrient concentration (Wilson et al., 2006). These 
data confirm findings in the present study. Alkaline natural 
water with hypolimnion oxygen deficit and an occurrence 
of Cyanobacteria phytoplankton, especially Microcystis sp. 
are indicative of the eutrophic nature of the water body 
(Rahman and Jewel, 2008). Results showed that when 

the density of Cyanobacteria was higher, 90 ind.m3 × 103 
(85.5%), the most representative group was Microcystis sp., 
with 65% of total cells in P

1
 during December. Jewel et al. 

(2006) reported that Cyanobacteria cell density increased 
as a function of mean nitrogen. Management practices of 
fish ponds, such as high allochthonous nutrients loading, 
results in massive development of phytoplankton and 
Cyanobacteria water blooms and high fluctuations of 
physical-chemical parameters (Pokorný and Hauser, 2002).

Cyanobacteria are also known to deeply affect 
zooplankton community structure and secondary production 
(Tillmans et al., 2008). Generally, Cyanobacteria are a poor

Chlorophyceae and/or flagellates. Besides, Cladocera and 
Rotifera populations are affected differently by distinct 
Cyanobacteria morphologies (Wilson et al., 2006). In this

reported for Rotifera species. This may be due to the fact 
that density of Rotifera at P

1
, was mainly represented by 

carnivorous species, such as Polyarthra dolichoptera, 
Asplanchna sp. and Thrichocerca sp., during the period.

The high density of Rotifera in the fish pond studied 
has been associated with high density of Cyanobacteria 
(December). According to Gilbert (1990), Cyanobacteria 
prevent the suppression of Rotifera by large Cladocera 
and lead towards the dominance of Rotifera. Several 
studies have demonstrated the effects of Cyanobacteria 
on Copepoda filtration rate, egg, production and survival 
(Ruokolainen et al., 2006; Wilson et al., 2006; Rahman 
and Jewel, 2008). Copepoda density decreased when high 
cell density of Cyanobacteria in P

1
 occurred in December 

and less representative in P
3
 in February and September; 

and in P
1
 and P

2
 in November. An increasing trend in 

Copepoda species occurred between May to July when 
Cyanobacteria density decreases. Evidence suggests that 
Cyanobacteria are low quality food for Copepoda owing 
to their protease inhibitors (Ruokolainen et al., 2006). The 
greatest abundances of Cyanobacteria were observed in 
the site P

1
 where orthophosphate concentration was at its 

lowest Cyanobacteria abundance might have been influenced 
by a favourable N:P ratio. Further shallow systems are 
characterised by phosphate limitation because the biologically 
available phosphorus amount is small when the quantity 
required for algal growth is take into consideration (Neofitou 
and Klaoudatos, 2008). Orthophosphate concentrations 
in the current study were lower than 50 mg.L–1, except 

at the P
6
 (September) site. This is probably due to high 

macrophytes density at the site (P
6
) which leads to high 

organic content. The P
6
 site exhibited great amounts of 

allochthonous materials coming from other fish ponds that 
directly discharge their load into the water body under 
analysis. This fact is supported by low orthophosphate 
concentrations corresponding to high plankton abundance 
from December to March.

In this study, phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations 
were below characteristic eutrophication conditions, 
which are 0.3 mg.L–1 for nitrogen and 0.001 mg.L–1 for 
phosphorus in fish ponds, considering the maximum value 
recommended as an environmental quality standard to 
avoid eutrophication (Neofitou and Klaoudatos, 2008). 
The opposite behaviour was observed with chlorophyll-a, 
which has shown concentrations of over 10 mg.L–1.

High rates of nutrients supply often constitute a large 
fraction of the photosynthetic biomass. Predominance of 
Bacillariophyceae species throughout the period under 
analysis has been associated with alkaline water, because 
acidic waters do not support an abundance of species and 
show high activity at relatively low temperature (Allen et al., 
2005). Kumar and Oommen (2009) reported that acidic 
waters do not support an abundance of Bacillariophyceae, 
whereas their density is higher in alkaline waters, with pH 
above 8.0, and diatom growth is stimulated by nitrate. In 
this investigation alkaline pH (between 7.2 and 8.8) except 
at P

3
 in October, and high nitrate concentrations, supported 

a high population of diatoms.
A high load of organic matter (dead algal cell, fish feed 

solids, uneaten feed) in bottom sediments is related to the 
fish pond’s fertilization management featuring plankton 
densities, high quantities of non-consumed remains and 
consequently large metabolites produced by fish, mainly 
in the growing fish period during the rainy and hot season. 
In fact, the fish pond under analysis, receives effluents 
from other ponds which contribute with large organic and 
inorganic loads into the system. The above mentioned are 
also responsible for high nitrate concentrations and organic 
matter associated with the large amounts of organic input 
originating from effluent discharge.

 Transparency indicates the presence and absence of 
food particles and productivity of a water body, which is 
influenced by suspended materials, silt and microorganisms 
(Ferdoushi et al., 2008). The above pattern was highly 
evident in the current analysis. When high transparency 
occurred in July, the Chlorophyceae, Zygnematophyceae 
and Euglenophyceae cell densities were below 17 ind.
m3 × 103 (6.7%) and Cyanobacteria were practically 
absent. The quantitative and qualitative abundance of 
plankton and its relationship to environmental conditions 
are a prerequisite for fish production. In fact, plankton 
productivity depends on the ecological balance between 
the various physical-chemical factors (Chowdhury et al., 
2007). In general, the highest transparency values were 
observed at P

6
 close to the macrophyte stand. Water bodies 

with medium and dense macrophytes cover are characterised 
by low concentration of suspended sediments; hence, their

high water transparency. Water transparency is reduced 
when opposite occurred (Ferdoushi et al., 2008).

Moreover, dissolved oxygen has been found to be 
considerably high in colder months (June to August). 
The plankton community, on which the whole aquatic 
population depends, is largely affected by an interaction 
of a number of limiting factors such as low dissolved 
oxygen, moderate sulphate, nitrate, phosphate and other 
factors (Kumar and Oommen, 2009).

According to cluster analysis for plankton, the sites 
influenced by allochthonous materials (organic and 
inorganic) of other fish ponds were very similar. P

3
 and 

P
2
 sites exhibited the highest differences when compared 

to other sites. Such differences may be associated with 
depth (P

3
) and strong water flow (P

2
), especially at this 

particular water outlet which directly discharges into the 
subsequent pond.

Management procedures (stocking densities, feeding, 
sediment removal, fertilizing) of fish ponds are the key to 
sustainable fish production and directly affect the ecological 
processes developing in the water column. Variations 
of the physical and chemical parameters in a fish pond 
reveal that the limnological conditions in the fish pond 
are not spatially homogenous, since differences have been 
observed not only between the different sampling months, 
but also between the different sites analysed. Based on the 
results of the current analysis, water quality management 
in the fish pond shows a direct influence on planktonic 
population, since fish ponds are shallow and constantly 
receive large nutrient loads (feed, fertilizing, fish waste) 
which contribute towards algal growth, Cyanobacteria and 
undesired zooplanktonic organisms. Excessive phytoplankton 
growth could be avoided by limiting nutrients to plankton 
growth through fish feed deprivation periods. The length 
of the latter may be sufficient so that phosphorus and 
nitrogen may be depleted and phytoplankton abundance 
decreased (Turano et al., 2008).

In summary, the fish pond studied was dominated 
by diatoms and green algae, while Cyanobacteria were 
more frequent during the summer. In general, whereas 
reported high phytoplankton density was registered in 
February and March (summer), zooplankton density 
occurred between December and March (summer). The 
maintenance of macrophytes at one of the fish pond’s 
water inlet sites (P

6
) was an asset for the retention of great 

organic and inorganic load from other ponds beyond that 
studied. Limnological conditions in the fish pond in fact 
affected the development of the different components 
of the plankton population during the period analysed. 
Future studies aiming at evaluating the effect of adequate 
management of water quality on planktonic population 
are thus encouraged.
