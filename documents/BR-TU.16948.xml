Regeneration of periodontal and alveolar ridge defects utilizing membranes is a well-established procedure in reconstructive surgery.
Biomaterial characteristics and membrane design employed in guided tissue regeneration (GTR) techniques play an important role in
good results. The purpose of this histologic experimental study in rats was to compare the use of two physical barriers in the
osteopromotion by using GTR principles in bone defects created in tibias. Fifteen animals divided into 3groups were used: group I (non-
porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) barrier), group II (coral hydroxyapatite (HA) blocks), and group III (defects that received no
physical barrier). Histological examination showed varied amounts of newly formed bone beneath both types of barriers. The non-
porous PTFE barrier showed better results than the HA group. The results of this study suggest that bone regeneration can be
successfully enhanced by a submerged membrane technique.

Key Words: guided bone regeneration, wound healing, polytetrafluoroethylene membrane, hydroxyapatite.

INTRODUCTION

Several studies and case reports have shown the
use of guided tissue regeneration (GTR) in the treat-
ment of localized atrophy of the alveolar edge in post-
extraction socket to prevent bone deformities, in the
treatment of bone defects associated with osseointe-
grated implants, and in several types of bone defects as
a consequence of periodontal diseases, endodontic le-
sions, cysts and tumors (1-3).

The treatment of local atrophies of the alveolar
edge with mucous membrane autogenous graft and HA
implant presents some disadvantages and technical prob-
lems. The use of autogenous bone grafts has the incon-
venience of adding a surgical area for the removal of an
adequate quantity of donor tissue.

Murray et al. (4), Hurley et al. (5), Linghorne (6)

and Melcher &amp;amp; Dreyer (1) were the first to use physical
barriers creating an acceptable environment for osteo-
genesis through the exclusion of cellular elements of
connective tissue in the repair area of a surgical wound.
Experimental bone defects created in mice jaws and
covered with polytetrafluoroethylene membrane showed
bone regeneration (2). The biological principles of
guided bone regeneration (GBR) can be used to in-
crease or to reconstruct aesthetically and functionally
the thickness and height of the atrophic alveolar edge
and calvarial defects (7).

More recent experimental studies have demon-
strated bone neoformation with the use of other types of
membranes that act as physical barriers to exclude non-
osteogenic soft tissue, so that the spaces created by the
material were repopulated by cells able to produce bone
tissue (8,9). In addition, an appropriate space is created

where the natural biological potential can be expanded
to assist the regeneration as desired (10).

Based on previous research (1,2,4,6), this work
was an attempt to histologically evaluate the response
of bone tissue and its regenerative potential after subpe-
riosteal implantation of PTFE and HA physical barriers
in the restoration of bone defects created in the rat femur.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Physical barriers

Two different types of non-absorbable material
were used in this study as physical barriers according to
GBR biological principles. One is manufactured as a
non-porous PTFE film (Tecnoflon &amp;amp; Brasflon, São
Paulo, SP, Brazil) (11) and the other as small blocks of
coral hydroxyapatite (HA; Faculty of Chemistry of
Lorena, Lorena, SP, Brazil) (12). Both materials were
cut to cover defects, extending for 2 to 3 mm beyond the
margins of the bone defects.

Surgical procedure

A total of 15 Albinus male rats, weighing 250-
300 g, were used and were fed a commercially prepared
solid diet and water ad libitum.

Preoperatively, the animals were anesthetized
with an intramuscular injection of aqueous solution of
chlorhydrate of 2-(2,6-xylidine)-5,6-dihydro-4H-1,3-
thiazine (Rompun, Bayer, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) and
ketamine (Francotar, Virbac, São Paulo, SP, Brazil), in
the proportion of 1:0.5 ml in the dose of 0.1 ml/100 mg
of body weight. After trichotomy and asepsis of the
operative field, the lateral surfaces of the tibia, in both
posterior paws, were exposed with removal of peri-
osteal tissue to form concave cortical defects, approxi-
mately 3 mm in diameter, with spherical surgical drills
at low rotation and constant irrigation with sterile sa-
line. The defects were created making superficial wastes
without perforations. In the right posterior paw, a PTFE
barrier was placed to cover the defect, while in the left
paw the defect was covered with small blocks of HA.
Five mice were used as controls, and their defects were
left to repair naturally. The incisions were sutured with
4-0 silk interrupted sutures (Ethicon-Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson,
São José dos Campos, SP, Brazil), for a first intention
repair.

Histological study

The animals were sacrificed with a high dose of
the anesthetic at 7, 14, 21 and 30 days post-operatively.
After sacrifice, fragments including the implanted ma-
terial were placed in labeled bottles for fixation in
10% formalin solution, for a minimum of 48 h, and
decalcified in 20% formic acid. The PTFE barrier was
subsequently removed and the material was processed
routinely for histological evaluation (5-µm thick sec-
tions and hematoxylin and eosin stain). The specimens
were analyzed with an optic microscope.

RESULTS

The HA blocks were totally removed by the
decalcification, with clear spaces remaining surrounded
by connective tissue. These spaces were located close
to the bone, eventually interposed among muscle fibers
or in the subcutaneous connective tissue. In all experi-
mental periods, septa of connective tissue were ob-
served projecting into the spaces.

7 days

Control: Discrete local bone neoformation in the
periphery of the cortical bone tissue was seen. This
neoformation was continuous with compact bone tis-
sue, in supracortical and subperiosteal disposition. The
newly formed trabeculae were perpendicular to the
cortical bone tissue, with an immature aspect, with
several osteocytes included and large osteoblasts aligned
along the trabeculae. The medullar spaces were filled
by well-vascularized loose connective tissue. The peri-
osteum was very cellular, in contact with the trabecu-
lae, and more fibrous externally (Figure 1 top).

PTFE: The barrier was outlined by connective
tissue rich in fibroblasts and fibrocytes, well-vascular-
ized and with interstitial edema. Mono- and polymor-
phonuclear inflammatory cells were present close to the
barrier, with fibrin deposit and remnants of necrotic
tissue in some areas. Discrete formation of fibers was
observed more externally. The muscle fibers close to
the barrier were dissociated by edema, discrete inflam-
matory infiltrate and dilated and congested blood ves-
sels. Subperiosteal bone neoformation was observed
between the external surface of the bone and the inter-
nal surface of the barrier. The newly formed bone

exhibited the same characteristics described for the
control (Figure 1 middle).

HA: The HA fragments were surrounded by
granulation tissue exhibiting young fibroblasts, newly
formed blood vessels, and discrete and diffuse mono-
nuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate. At the interface
with the fragment, there were remnants of fibrin net,
containing erythrocytes and polymorphonuclear neu-
trophils. More externally, there was a discrete fibrosis.
Newly formed bone trabeculae, in general perpendicu-
lar to the cortical bone tissue, with radiated disposition,
in supracortical and subperiosteal location were ob-
served (Figure 1 bottom). The bone neoformation was
seen mainly at the internal surface of the HA fragments;
however, it was also observed in other external areas.

14 days

Control: The areas of bone neoformation showed
a more mature aspect than observed at 7 days. The
trabeculae were thicker, surrounded by large osteo-
blasts, and the medullar spaces were smaller. Baso-
philic lines indicating bone resorption followed by
neoformation were observed below this area.

PTFE: Discrete fibrosis was observed around
the barrier, with a few inflammatory cells, especially
macrophages and eosinophils. One of the specimens
presented a foreign body reaction between the bone and
the barrier. The interposition of muscle fibers between
the barrier and the bone was observed in some areas.
The newly formed tissue was thinner than that observed at
7 days, and was more mature with lamellar trabeculae.

HA: The newly formed bone tissue presented a
more mature aspect than that observed at 7 days, with
smaller medullar spaces.

21 days

Control: The newly formed bone trabeculae were
lamellar, sometimes irregular and immature.

PTFE: The barrier was surrounded by fibrous
connective tissue, containing some macrophages at the
interface with the material. The newly formed bone
tissue was mature, with lamellar trabeculae; however,
in 2 specimens it presented wide medullar spaces,
outlined by osteoblasts and containing numerous fatty
cells.

HA: The newly formed bone tissue presented

thick lamellar trabeculae and reduced medullar spaces.

30 days

Control: The newly formed bone exhibited
remodelation aspects, with the presence of basophilic
lines indicating resorption and bone neoformation (Fig-
ure 2 top).

PTFE: The barrier was surrounded by fibrous
connective tissue with rare macrophages. The newly
formed bone exhibited a mature aspect with concentric
lamellae around vascular channels (Figure 2 middle).

HA: The HA fragments were surrounded by
fibrous connective tissue, with discrete mono- and poly-

morphonuclear inflammatory infiltrate, especially in
the septa of connective tissue that projected into the
interior of the space. The newly formed bone tissue
showed mature lamellar trabeculae and small medullar
spaces. Newly formed cartilage was eventually ob-
served contiguous with the HA fragments or with the
connective tissue that surrounded the fragments (Fig-
ure 2 bottom).

DISCUSSION

Although this was not the main objective, this
histological study confirmed the biocompatibility of
physical barriers, previously reported by Macedo et al.
(11,12). However, HA caused a more pronounced in-
flammatory response that persisted for the entire study
period without effects on bone neoformation (13). Hy-
droxyapatite can attract circulating biocomponents to
sites of tissue repair to promote bone repair (14,15).

The microscopic analysis demonstrated the lo-
cation of the barrier of PTFE sometimes close to the
bone and sometimes separated from the bone by muscle
tissue. Around the barrier, there was an inflammatory
reaction, initially characterized by edema, vascular con-
gestion and mono- and polymorphonuclear inflamma-
tory infiltrate. As already reported by Macedo et al.
(11), the inflammatory reaction decreased its intensity
with time, the infiltrate became mainly macrophagic
and the formation of collagen fibers began. Up to 30
days, fibrous dense connective tissue was observed
around the membrane, with rare macrophages in con-
tact with it.

Bone neoformation was observed in the bone
outer surface, located directly over the pre-existent
cortical bone plate and under the periosteum. This bone
tissue was initially immature and became more mature
during subsequent periods, going from cancellous bone,
with many cellular bone trabeculae that delimited wide
medullar spaces, to compact bone tissue, with forma-
tion of osteons and parallel bone lamellae. As in the
studies of Murray et al. (4) and Mecher &amp;amp; Dreyer (1),
the bone neoformation, in the present study, showed a
continuous protuberance that stood out from the adja-
cent bone profile.

The importance of the blood coagulum and the
use of physical barriers in bone defects in several
clinical situations has been reported (1,5,7,12,16). In
this study, physical barriers (PTFE and HA) on the bone

defect filled out with blood coagulum that created
conditions for the area of the surgical wound to be
colonized by osteogenic cells of the adjacent bone
tissue. The physical barrier protects the blood coagu-
lum from moving away due to the mechanical stress
that acts on the flap during the earliest phase of wound
repair. Micromovements of the flap in the initial phase
of repair are enough to modify the differentiation of
mesenchymal cells from osteoblasts to fibroblasts (17).
The displacement and the movement of the membrane
affect the stabilization of the surgical wound and the
blood coagulum would be colonized by connective
tissue cells. Fibroblasts growing more quickly occupy
the bone defect preventing osteogenesis.

In this study, the variation of the amount of
newly formed bone was due to the fact that physical
barriers were placed on the defects without the aid of
sutures or microscrew fixation. This made their dis-
placement possible, inducing variations in the shape
and dimension of the space for bone growth. However,
when the membrane remained in place, large amounts
of bone neoformation were obtained, even during the
initial periods of the study. The correlation between the
maintenance of the space and the amount of bone
neoformation in rats was shown. On the other hand, in
the control group, in which no type of physical barrier
was used, there was also a small amount of bone
neoformation as a consequence of the absence of su-
tures in the deepest planes of the surgical wound, and
probably periosteum stimulation due to the raising of
the flap. In this case, tissues were not well adapted on
the bone defect, creating a narrow space between soft
and bone tissues.

Schmid et al. (18) and Weng et al. (19) reported
that the periosteum is not that important for guided
bone regeneration techniques. Our study demonstrated
bone neoformation without suture of the deepest planes,
and isolation of periosteum by the barriers.

The critical size of the bony defects constituted
another important factor, and perhaps influenced the
variation in bone neoformation found in this study
(19,20). Bone defects smaller than 5 mm are critical to
study the bone neoformation because a natural regen-
eration occurs. In this study, the creation of concave
defects (no cavities) might have contributed for the
osteogenic cells of the margins of the defect to supply
elements for bone neoformation as a protuberance in
continuity with the adjacent bone, in the space main-

tained by the physical barriers.
Unlike Dahlin et al. (2), this study also demon-

strated that bone regeneration using the GBR biologi-
cal principles can also be obtained with non-porous
physical barriers, in agreement with the results of Schmid
et al. (18). Thus, we can suggest the use of non-porous
PTFE physical barriers in the treatment of periodontal
disease bone defects, originating from endodontic and
cystic lesions, osseointegrated implant associated de-
fects, prevention and treatment of atrophy of the alveo-
lar ridge, etc.

Thus, we conclude that: the physical barriers
used in this study helped exclude the adjacent soft
tissues, allowing the area of the bony defect to be
preferentially repopulated by cells with osteogenic ca-
pacity; non-porous PTFE barriers fit better than HA in
the GBR biological principles, and results can be ex-
trapolated for the clinical treatment of several types of
bone defects and the predictable osteopromotion in
several clinical situations; the porosity and the integra-
tion of the physical barrier were not absolutely neces-
sary for bone neoformation in the GBR technique; the
amount of bone neoformation depended on the volume
of the space created by the physical barriers.

RESUMO

A regeneração periodontal e do rebordo ósseo utilizando barreiras
físicas são procedimentos bem estabelecidos em cirurgias
reconstrutivas. As características do biomaterial e o desenho da
membrana empregados na regeneração tecidual guiada
desempenham um papel importante na obtenção de bons
resultados. O objetivo deste estudo experimental histológico foi
comparar o uso de dois tipos de barreiras físicas na regeneração
óssea guiada em defeitos criados na tíbia de ratos. Quinze
animais foram divididos em três grupos: grupo I (barreira não-
porosa de politetrafluoretileno), grupo II (blocos de hidroxiapatita
de coral) e grupo III (controle que não recebeu nenhuma barreira).
A análise histológica demonstrou várias quantidades de osso
neoformado com ambos os tipos de barreiras. A barreira de
politetrafluoretileno mostrou melhores resultados do que a
hidroxiapatita. Os resultados deste estudo sugerem que a
regeneração óssea pode ser conseguida com a técnica de
submersão da barreira física.
