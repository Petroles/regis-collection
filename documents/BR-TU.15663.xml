Resumo expandido 
 

Os halogênios são um grupo de elementos que apresentam diversas 
particularidades, tornando-os muito importantes para diversos propósitos. No 
entanto, esses elementos apresentam elevado grau de toxicidade quando 
ingeridos ou inalados, e são considerados perigosos quando presentes no meio 
ambiente, devido principalmente ao fato de poderem reagir com moléculas de 
O3, promovendo a destruição da camada de ozônio. 

Considerando a alta aplicabilidade dos halogênios e seus efeitos 
adversos ao ambiente e em sistemas biológicos, faz-se necessário o 
estabelecimento de métodos sensíveis, com exatidão e precisão, para a sua 
determinação.  

Técnicas como eletrodos de íon seletivos, cromatografia de íons, 
análise por ativação de nêutrons instrumental, espectroscopia de fluorescência 
por raios-X, entre outros, foram propostos e aplicados com sucesso para analise 
de halogêneos em diversas matrizes, no entanto, em alguns casos, morosas 
etapas de preparo de amostras são necessárias, além de algumas das técnicas 
apresentarem limitações para analise multielementar, baixa sensibilidade, baixa 
frequência analítica, incidência de interferências e curta faixa linear para 
quantificação.  

Além de problemas para sua quantificação, a medida de razão isotópica 
de halogênios ainda é um desafio. Algumas técnicas têm sido aplicadas para 
este propósito como a espectrometria de massas de razão isotópica e 
espectrometria de massas por ionização química, entretanto, normalmente 
apresentam baixa precisão além de apresentarem muitos dos problemas 
apresentados para quantificação.  

Desta forma, o objetivo geral deste trabalho é apresentar propostas a 
fim de solucionar os problemas enfrentados para análise de halogênios por 
espectrometria de massas por plasma indutivamente acoplado (ICP-MS) e 
analise de razões isotópicas por multicoletor (MC)-ICP-MS, aplicando os 
métodos desenvolvidos para o estudo de casos ambientais reais.  

Uma breve introdução abordando os conceitos básicos sobre a 
importância dos halogênios, uma visão geral sobre funcionamento de 
equipamentos ICP-MS, determinação e análise isotópica de halogênios por 
ICP-MS é apresentada no Capítulo 1 o qual é seguindo pelos Capítulos 2, 3 e 4 
onde se apresentam novas propostas para determinação de halogênios por meio 
da analise direta de sólidos utilizando vaporização eletrotérmica (SS-ETV)-
ICP-MS e aplicação dos métodos propostos a analise de amostras biológicas, 
minerais e ambientais em diferentes estudos. O Capítulo 5 apresenta o 
desenvolvimento de um método simples para determinação direta de Br em 
amostras de polímeros por ablação a laser (LA)-ICP-MS, enquanto que os 
Capítulos 6, 7 e 8 abordam o desenvolvimento de métodos para medida da 
razão isotópica de halogênios em água do mar e amostras de gelo marinho por 
MC-ICP-MS.  



 

 

No Capítulo 2, uma nova metodologia para a determinação de Cl em 
amostras biológicas e botânicas usando SS-ETV-ICP-MS é apresentada. As 
amostras sólidas foram pesadas diretamente em plataformas de grafite (copos 
de grafite da técnica cup-in-tube) e inseridas no forno de grafite. Os parâmetros 
de potencial de rádio frequência (RF) e a vazão de gás carreador foram 
otimizados em 1300 W e 0,7 L min-1, respectivamente.  

Padrões aquosos foram utilizados para a obtenção da curva de 
calibração com o auxílio de modificadores pré-secos (Pd + Nd ou Pd + Ca) ou 
utilizando um material de referencia certificado (CRM) sólido com os mesmos 
modificadores pré-secos ou sem a utilização de modificadores. O limite de 
quantificação (LOQ) obtido foi 5 µg g-1 sob condições otimizadas.  

A concentração de Cl foi determinada em cinco amostras de referência 
certificadas, com concentrações certificados para Cl, além de três amostras de 
referência certificados com concentrações certificadas para Cl indisponíveis, 
neste último caso, os resultados foram comparados àqueles obtidos utilizando 
espectrometria de absorção molecular de alta resolução com fonte contínua 
(HR-CS MAS). As concentrações obtidas demonstraram-se em acordo, a um 
nível de confiança estatística de 95%, com os valores certificados ou de 
referência. 

O Capítulo 3 apresenta um novo método para a determinação direta e 
simultânea Br e Cl em amostras de carvão utilizando SS-ETV-ICP-MS. O 
processo não requer pré-tratamento de amostras e necessita de pequenas 
alíquotas de massa de amostra (cerca de 0,5 mg). Todos os parâmetros 
operacionais, incluindo vazão de gás carreador e potencial de RF, foram 
otimizados para o máximo de sensibilidade.  

O uso de modificadores/ carreadores de aerossóis (Pd, Pd + Al e Pd + 
Ca) foi avaliado e a combinação de Pd e Ca foi escolhida, permitindo a adoção 
das temperaturas de pirólise e vaporização de 700 oC e 1900 oC, 
respectivamente. Cloro foi determinado com o auxilio de calibração utilizando 
padrões sólidos, enquanto Br foi determinado tanto por calibração aquosa 
quanto utilizando CRM sólidos. Os LOQs obtidos foram de 0,03 µg g-1 para Br 
e 7 µg g-1 para Cl, interferências espectrais não foram observadas. 

No Capítulo 4 foi avaliada a viabilidade da análise direta de sólidos por 
HR-CS MAS para a determinação de F e ETV-ICP-MS para determinação 
simultânea de Cl, Br e I em material particulado inalável no ar (PM10), 
coletados na região metropolitana de Aracaju, Sergipe, Brasil.  

As análises de F por HR-CS MAS foram realizadas monitorando a 
molécula de CaF que foi gerada a altas temperaturas na câmara de grafite após 
a adição de cálcio em uma relação Ca/ F de 35. As análises por ETV-ICP-MS 
foram realizadas utilizando Ca como modificador químico/ carreador de 
aerossol com a utilização concomitante de Pd como modificador permanente, a 
fim de evitar perdas de Cl, Br e I durante a etapa de pirólise. 

A abordagem de analise direta de sólidos resultou em LOQs adequados 
para a determinação de halogêneos em PM10, usando a calibração por adição de 
analito ou calibração utilizando um CRM solido. O método permitiu a 



 

 

quantificação dos halogênios em 14 PM10 coletadas em uma cidade costeira do 
nordeste do Brasil. Os resultados demonstraram variações de teor de halogênios 
de acordo com as condições meteorológicas, principalmente relacionados a 
chuvas, umidade e irradiação solar. 

O Capítulo 5 foi destinado à avaliação da utilização da LA-ICP-MS 
para análise de Br em amostras de polímeros. Os parâmetros operacionais do 
LA-ICP-MS, incluindo a vazão de gás carreador, potencial de RF, tamanho da 
cratera de ablação e frequência do laser foram otimizados para o máximo de 
sensibilidade. Os valores otimizados foram 0,6 L min-1 para vazão de gás 
carreador (He), 950 W de potencial de RF, 120 µm de tamanho da cratera de 
ablação e 15 Hz de frequência do laser.  

Sob condições otimizadas foi possível determinar, com exatidão, Br em 
5 amostras certificadas de polímeros e 5 amostras reais de polímeros obtidas em 
estabelecimentos locais em Ghent, Bélgica por calibração externa utilizando 
CRMs contendo diferentes concentrações de Br e por calibração externa 
utilizando apenas um CRM monitorando 12C+ como padrão interno.  O LOQ 
obtido foi de 110  µg g-1 para Br. 

O Capítulo 6 apresenta um método simples para medida da razão 
isotópica de Br em água do mar por MC-ICP-MS, utilizando nebulização 
pneumática para introdução da amostra. Os sinais dos isótopos de Br+ foram 
medidos livre de interferências utilizando alta resolução. O efeitos de memória 
para Br foi diminuído utilizando  5 mmol L-1 NH4OH como solução de limpeza 
entre as medidas. O conteúdo catiônico da água do mar foi removido por 
cromatografia catiônica utilizando uma resina Dowex 50WX8. Pré-
concentração das amostras foi obtida por evaporação a 90°C, sem perda ou 
fraccionamento isotópico de Br.  

Discriminação de massas foi corrigida por correção externa utilizando 
bracketing, embora Sr, Ge e Se foram testados como potenciais padrões 
internos. Os valores 81Br/ 79Br obtidos para os materiais de referência isotópicos 
(NaBr) NIST (material de referencia padrão) SRM 977 e (água do mar) IRMM 
BCR-403 demonstraram estar de acordo com os valores da literatura. 

No Capítulo 7, a medida da razão isotópica de Cl em água do mar por 
MC-ICP-MS através de nebulização pneumática tradicional foi realizada 
utilizando, i) alta resolução de massa (potencial de resolução de 10.000) para 
resolver interferências espectrais, ii) 5 mmol L-1 NH4OH como solução de 
limpeza a fim de diminuir o efeito de memória e iii) uma concentração de Cl de 
? 70 mg L-1.  

A carga catiônica da água do mar e de sais de cloreto (NaCl, KCl) foi 
eficientemente removida sem afetar a composição isotópica original da Cl 
através de cromatografia catiônica utilizando resina de troca iônica Dowex 
50WX8. O método desenvolvido demonstrou alta exatidão e precisão, atestadas 
pela medição da razão isotópica 37Cl/ 35Cl na amostra CRM NIST 975a (valor 
obtido de 0,319765 ± 0,000022, em comparação com um valor de referência de 
0,319768 ± 0,000187 a uma precisão de ~ 0,007%, desvio padrão relativo, n = 
3). 



 

 

Além disso, o valor  ?37Cl (baseado no padrão de cloro em agua do 
mar, SMOC) foi determinado para cinco padrões diferentes que variaram de -
0,54 a + 0,89 ‰. 

O Capítulo 8 apresenta um estudo ambiental de Br e Cl  em gelo 
marinho coletados durante a expedição Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem 
eXperiment 2012, em diferentes profundidades e locais. Todas as medições de 
razão isotópicas de Br e Cl foram realizadas de acordo com os métodos 
apresentados no Capítulo 6 e 7. 

A concentração destes elementos variou de 700 para 31000 µg L -1 para 
Br e de 200 para 8000 mg L-1 para Cl, sendo que as menores concentrações 
foram relacionados com o gelo coletado em maiores profundidades, estando a 
diminuição da concentração de Br e Cl provavelmente relacionadas a processos 
de dessalinização. 

Os valores de ?81Br e  ?37Cl  apresentaram relação linear com a suas 
concentrações, sugerindo que o processo de dessalinização desempenha um 
papel no fraccionamento isotópico no gelo do mar. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

Abstract 

Dit werk presenteert nieuwe methodes voor de kwantitatieve bepaling 
van halogenen door middel van inductief gekoppeld plasma massaspectrometrie 
(ICP-MS)  en voor de meting van isotopen verhoudingen gebruikmakend van 
multicollector (MC) ICP-MS.   

  Vier methodes voor directe vastestofanalyse (SS) door middel van 
ICP-MS – drie met behulp van elektrothermische vervluchtiging (ETV) en één 
middels laser ablatie (LA) – en twee methodes voor de isotopenanalyse van Br 
en Cl in zeewater met MC-ICP-MS werden ontwikkeld. Deze methodes werden 
toegepast op stalen afkomstig uit concrete studies en geven als dusdanig 
relevante resultaten met betrekking tot milieuprocessen. In alle methodes 
waarin SS-ETV-ICP-MS toegepast werd, werden de vaste stalen direct 
afgewogen in grafietbuisjes en ingebracht in de grafietoven. De instrumentele 
parameters werden geoptimaliseerd voor het bekomen van een hoge 
gevoeligheid en efficiënte verwijdering van de matrix. Chloorbepaling in 
biologische stalen kon uitgevoerd worden via kalibratie tegenover waterige 
standaardoplossingen, in de aanwezigheid van vooraf gedroogde modifiers (Pd 
+ Nd of Pd + Ca) of met gecertificeerde vaste referentiematerialen (CRMs), 
eveneens in de aanwezigheid van vooraf gedroogde modifiers of zonder 
gebruik te maken van modifiers, wat leidt tot een kwantificatielimiet (LOQ) 
van 5 µg g-1. Voor de bepaling van Br en Cl in steenkoolstalen werd Cl accuraat 
gemeten middels kalibratie met vaste standaarden, terwijl Br ook succesvol 
werd gekwantificeerd via kalibratie met waterige standaardoplossingen, in 
beide gevallen met vooraf gedroogde modifiers (Pd + Ca). 
Kwantificatielimieten van 0.03 µg g-1 en 7 µg g-1 werden bereikt voor 
respectievelijk Br en Cl. In een derde deel van dit werk werden F, Cl, Br en I 
bepaald in fijn stof (PM10). Fluor werd bepaald middels hoge resolutie 
moleculaire absorbtiespectrometrie (HR-CS MAS), waarbij de CaF molecule 
geobserveerd werd, terwijl Cl, Br en I bepaald werd door middel van SS-ETV-
ICP-MS. De methode liet de kwantificatie van halogenen toe in 14 PM10-stalen 
verzameld in een noordoostelijke kuststad in Brazilië. De resultaten toonden 
variaties in halogeengehalte naargelang de meteorologische omstandigheden, in 
het bijzonder gerelateerd aan regenval, relatieve luchtvochtigheid en 
zonneschijn. In een vierde deel wordt de bepaling van broom in polymeerstalen 
met LA-ICP-MS behandeld. Onder geoptimaliseerde omstandigheden kon Br 
accuraat bepaald worden in vijf verschillende polymeerstandaarden (CRM) en 
vijf ‘echte’ polymeerstalen door externe calibratie tegenover verschillende 
CRMs en eveneens door externe calibratie tegenover slechts één CRM, mits 
gebruik van het 12C+ als interne standaard. De LOQ werd bepaald op 110 µg g-1 
Br.  

Daarnaast werd aangetoond dat de accurate en precieze meting van 
broom- en chloorisotopen verhoudingen in zeewater via MC-ICP-MS mogelijk 
is mits het gebruik van hoge massaresolutie, en door toevoeging van 5 mmol L-
1 NH4OH aan alle staal-, standaard- en wasoplossingen (voor 



 

 

analietconcentraties van ? 3 mg L-1 voor Br en ? 70 mg L-1 voor Cl). Het 
overgrote deel van de kationen in zeewater werd voorafgaand aan de analyse 
verwijderd door kationenuitwisselingschromatografie (Dowex 50WX8 hars). In 
het geval van Br liet het uitdampen van de stalen bij 90°C toe om de stalen op 
te concentreren zonder analietverlies of isotopische fractionatie. Voor beide 
elementen werd gecorrigeerd voor massadiscriminatie door externe correctie in 
een staal-standaard ‘bracketing’ benadering, en tevens werd ook nagegaan of 
Sr, Ge of Se kunnen aangewend worden als potentiële interne standaarden voor 
Br-isotopenanalyse. Vergelijking van de bekomen resultaten bij de analyse van 
CRMs met de referentiewaarden of waarden uit de literatuur, toonde aan dat 
beide methodes aanleiding geven tot precieze en accurate resultaten. Tot slot 
werden deze methodes toegepast als onderdeel van een milieustudie rond de 
aanwezigheid van Br en Cl in zeeijs verzameld op verschillende dieptes en 
locaties tijdens de Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiment 2012 expeditie. 
De concentratie van deze elementen in de stalen bedroeg 700 tot 31000 µ g L-1 
Br en 200 tot 8000 mg L-1 Cl en er werd een relatie aangetoond tussen de Br en 
Cl concentraties in de stalen en de overeenkomstige ?81Br en ?37Cl waarden. De 
lagere concentraties en ?-waarden werden geobserveerd in diep zeeijs, wat 
waarschijnlijk verklaard kan worden door de optredende ontzoutingsprocessen.  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

Abstract 

 This work presents new approaches for halogen determination in a 
variety of samples using inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (ICP-
MS) and for isotope ratio measurements by multicollector – inductively 
coupled plasma – mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) and application of the 
methods developed to real environmental cases. Four methods for solid 
sampling (SS) analysis by ICP-MS, three using electrothermal vaporization - 
inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry (ETV-ICP-MS) and one using 
laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), 
and two methods for isotopic analysis by MC-ICP-MS, one for Br and another 
for Cl in sea water, were developed. The methods were applied for studying 
samples from real study cases, providing significant results with respect to 
environmental processes.  For all three methods using SS-ETV-ICP-MS, the 
solid samples were directly weighed into graphite ‘cups’ that were subsequently 
inserted into the graphite furnace, and the instrumental parameters were 
optimized for high sensitivity and efficient matrix removal. Chlorine 
determination in biological samples could be carried out using aqueous 
standard solutions, when using pre-dried modifiers (Pd + Nd or Pd + Ca) or 
using solid certified reference material (CRM), accompanied with or without 
the same pre-dried, achieving a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 5 µg g-1. For 
Br and Cl determination in coal samples, Cl was accurately determined using 
calibration against solid standards, whereas Br could also be quantified 
adequately by using calibration against aqueous standard solutions, both using 
pre-dried modifiers (Pd + Ca), LOQs of 0.03 µg g-1 for Br and 7 µg g-1 for Cl 
were achieved. F, Cl, Br and I were determined in particulate matter, F was 
determined via high resolution – continuum source molecular absorption 
spectrometry (HR-CS MAS) for monitoring the CaF molecule, while Cl, Br and 
I were determined via SS-ETV-ICP-MS. This method allowed the 
quantification of the halogens in 14 PM10 samples collected in a Northeastern 
coastal city in Brazil. The results demonstrated variations of the halogen 
contents according to meteorological conditions, particularly related to rainfall, 
humidity and sunlight irradiation. Bromine determination in polymer samples 
was accomplished via LA-ICP-MS after the optimization of the operational 
parameters for high sensitivity. Under optimized conditions, it was possible to 
accurately determine Br in 5 different certified polymer reference materials and 
5 real polymer samples by external calibration using different certified 
materials containing different concentrations of Br and by external calibration 
against a single certified material monitoring 12C+ as internal standard. The 
LOQ obtained was 110 µg g-1 of Br. Bromine and Cl isotopic analysis in 
seawater via MC-ICP-MS was proven feasible, operated in high mass 
resolution and by decreasing the memory effect using 5 mmol L-1 of NH4OH in 
sample, standard and wash solutions. Optimal analyte concentrations were ? 3 
mg L-1 for Br and ? 70 mg L-1 for Cl. The major cation load of seawater was 
removed via cation exchange chromatography (Dowex 50WX8 resin). In the 



 

 

case of Br, evaporation of the samples at 90°C permitted analyte 
preconcentration without Br loss or isotope fractionation. Mass discrimination 
was corrected for by external correction in a sample-standard bracketing 
approach for both elements. Sr, Ge and Se were also tested as potential internal 
standards for Br isotopic analysis but provided no advantage. Both methods 
demonstrated high precision and accuracy based on the comparison of 
experimental values with certified and literature values. The methods were 
applied within the context of an environmental study of Br and Cl in sea ice 
collected during the Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiment 2012 voyage at 
different depths and locations. The concentration of these elements in the 
samples ranged from 700 to 31000 µg L-1 for Br and from 200 mg L-1 to 8000 
mg L-1 for Cl, and a relation between the concentrations and the corresponding 
?81Br and ?37Cl values was found. Lower concentrations and  ? values were 
observed for sea ice collected at greater depths and are probably related to 
desalinization processes.

Introduction 

The halogens are a group of elements that present different 
applicabilities, properties, toxic effects and behavior in the environment. 
They are produced and released into the environment either via human 
activities or via natural processes, such as the burning of fossils fuels or 
volcanic eruptions, therefore, their monitoring is important in order to 
evaluate contaminations, impacted areas, environmental reactions and 
biological mechanisms among others. 

The monitoring of halogens is an important task that can be 
accomplished by the use of different techniques, however most of these 
techniques present some drawbacks, such as the need for time-
consuming sample pretreatment, low sensitivity and mono element 
character. Specially, the sample pretreatment can be a challenging issue 
for halogen determination and must be carefully carried out in order not 
to promote analyte loss or contamination. 

 In this sense, the use of Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass 
Spectrometry (ICP-MS) is an attractive alternative for halogen 
determination, presenting high sensitivity, multielement capabilities, 
wide linear dynamic range and can be coupled to solid sample 
techniques. Moreover, it can be used for isotope ratio measurements 
with high precision. 

Thus, the aim of this work was to develop straightforward 
methods for halogen determination by solid sample – electrothermal 
vaporization - inductively coupled plasma-Mass Spectrometry (SS-
ETV-ICP-MS) and laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma - mass 
spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and for halogen isotope measurements by 
multicollector - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (MC-
ICP-MS), applying the developed methods for studying samples 
obtained from real life cases. 

This work is divided to eight chapters, consisting of a revision 
of the literature in Chapter 1; the development of methods for halogen 
determination by solid sample analysis using ICP-MS and a case study 
in the Chapters 2, 3 and 4; the development of a straightforward method 
for Br determination in polymer samples via LA-ICP-MS in Chapter 5; 
and the development of methods for halogen isotope ratio measurements 
and a case study in Chapters 6, 7 and 8.    -------------------------------------

1.1. Introduction 

The halogens are a group of elements which present distinct 
applications, physiological functions, properties and toxicological 
importance [1-2]. They are released into the environment either by 
human activities or natural processes, hence their monitoring is 
important in order to assess, among others, contamination, impacted 
areas, environmental reactions and biological mechanisms [1-2]. 

The monitoring of halogens in environmental and biological 
systems is still a challenging task due to analytical issues, which range 
from the sample preparation to the instrumental detection by the selected 
technique [3-4]. 

In order to avoid analyte loss or contamination, the sample 
pretreatment must be wisely selected and carefully carried out. A few 
approaches may be used, such as pyrohydrolysis, combustion bomb, 
oxygen flask, microwave - induced combustion (MIC) or even 
extraction procedures. In this sense, direct solid sample analysis is a 
very attractive alternative since no sample pretreatment is required, thus 
avoiding the risk of contamination and/or analyte loss [4]. 

Among the available techniques for halogen analysis, ICP-MS 
has demonstrated to be attractive due to its multielement capabilities, 
high sensitivity and wide linear range for calibration, in addition to the 
possibility to carry out high precision isotope ratios measurements, 
mainly using MC-ICP-MS [5]. 

Thus, the aim of this chapter is to introduce the concepts 
associated to halogen analysis, from sample pretreatment to the 
instrumental analysis by ICP-MS, addressing part of the discussion on 
principles and basic concepts of the techniques.   

1.2. Halogens 

Halogens are reactive elements from group 17 of the periodic 
table, which present different physical properties among them. These 
differences lead to distinct reactions and applications [1-6]. 

In nature, the halogens can be found in several natural 
reservoirs as halides combined with other elements [1-2, 6]. The 
distribution of halogens in nature is not entirely known, firstly because, 
in some cases, they are present at very low concentrations, hindering 



Chapter 1

?

their monitoring using the available traditional techniques [6,7-9], and 
secondly, due to their dynamic characteristics regarding environmental 
processes such as volcanic eruptions, movement of wind and sea, and 
environmental reactions, as for example bromine explosion events 
(which is a photocatalytic reaction that converts halides salts into 
reactive halogens which are released to the environment) [6,10].  

Industrially, the halogens are employed for several purposes, 
including water treatment [11], as polymers additives and in paper 
manufacturing [12] and oral hygiene products [13]. Despite their wide 
applicability, a few problems are generally related to their presence in 
the environment, such as the ability to destroy O3 [14] molecules. 
Therefore, the halogens are regarded as powerful disrupting agents of 
the ozone layer [7, 15-17]. 

The halogens can be released to the atmosphere by 
anthropogenic processes as well as by natural processes, such as 
volcanic eruptions and evaporation from the ocean. The majority of the 
organic gases containing halogens is man-made and may remain in the 
atmosphere for up to 100 years [9-10]. 

In biological systems, the halogens can be found either as halide 
ions or as part of organic molecules, which include proteins, and present 
different properties [18-19]. An example is the capture of iodine by the 
thyroids acting on the hormonal adjustment [20], and the decrease in the 
incidence of teeth cavities by the use of fluorine. Chlorine helps 
regulating the osmotic pressure in extracellular fluids and is also present 
in saliva and digestive fluids in the stomach [10].

The properties of the halogens and halogenated compounds 
called the attention of the pharmaceutical industry, and several studies 
have been carried out applying halogens or compounds containing 
halogens as medicinal drugs to help the treatment of serious diseases, 
such as cancer [21] or diseases with a lower death incidence, such as 
those related to the central nervous system [22]. 

Despite the potential benefits associated to the diverse uses of 
halogens, several toxic effects are related to their presence which are 
more intensified at high concentrations, in some cases the toxic effects 
of the halogens at high concentrations resemble those attributed to 
elements such as As and Hg [23].

1.3. Halogen determination 

1.3.1. Sample pretreatment  

The sample pretreatment required for halogen determination by 
means of ICP-MS is a critical step since most procedures adopted to 
decompose solid samples are based on the use of inorganic acids, which 
promote the volatilization of the halogens as hydrogen halides. In 
addition, contamination and interferences arising from the reagents used 
for sample preparation are also important issues to be considered [24]. 
Thus, methods that do not require the use of inorganic acids during the 
sample pretreatment may be successfully employed; these include 
pyrohydrolysis [25], microwave-induced combustion (MIC), 
combustion based procedures and alkaline treatment. [26]. Moreover, 
the sample handling in order to reduce the particle’s size prior the 
sample pretreatment is an important issue for halogen determination, 
methods which avoid the heating of the sample by physical processes 
may be preferred in order to avoid analyte volatilization. 

Pyrohydrolysis was first used for industrial processes and it was 
applied as a sample pretreatment process for analytical purposes for the 
first time in 1954 [25], and since then it has been successfully used for 
sample preparation associated to the determination of volatile analytes in 
several sorts of samples. The basic principle of pyrohydrolysis is the 
heating of the sample, which leads to volatilization of the analytes that 
are carried to and retained in a solution that shows affinity for the 
analytes [4]. 

Figure 1 presents the simplified scheme of a pyrohydrolysis 
device, in which the sample is heated in a sample holder (Figure 1D) 
positioned into a quartz tube (Figure 1C) volatilizing the analyte, while 
water is inserted through a tube using a peristaltic pump in order to 
produce water vapor. The water vapor is carried by a gas flow inserted 
by a tube (Figure 1A) that also carries the analytes to the condenser. The 
water vapor containing the volatized compounds from the sample is 
condensed and retained into the absorbing solution [28]. Heating is 
normally provided by a furnace (Figure 1B), which is normally based on 
electrothermal heating with a temperature control.

Pyrohydrolysis devices have been successfully applied for 
sample pretreatment prior to the determination of volatile elements in 



Chapter 1

different matrices such as coal, geological samples [29-30], biological 
samples [31] and even carbon nanotubes [28].

Combustion techniques have been used for sample pretreatment 
since the eighteenth century, including combustion of samples for 
posterior analysis by open, dynamic or closed systems [4, 32]. Closed 
systems will be focused in this chapter due to the goal of decreasing the 
possibility of analyte loss by volatilization and therefore, is feasible to 
be applied for halogen determination. 

Closed combustion systems may avoid loss of the analyte due 
to the retention of the combustion products into the vessels, with 
subsequent absorption of the analytes in an absorbing solution [32]. 
These systems comprise the combustion bomb, the oxygen flask and, the 
more recently developed technique for combustion, the MIC. 

The combustion bomb is normally used for organic matrices 
with the advantage of simplicity and ability to decompose the samples in 
only a few minutes (normally less than 30 min including cooling step).  
In the combustion bomb, the sample (at least 0.5 mg) is combusted

inside of a vessel made of stainless steel that is pressurized with oxygen. 
The products generated by the combustion of the sample are absorbed 
into a suitable solution located into the stainless steel bomb [4].

Figure 2 presents a simplified scheme of the combustion bomb 
in which the sample is inserted as pellets into a metallic cup (ignition 
cup) and ignited using a Pt or Ni/Cr wire connected to electrodes and 
positioned in close contact with the pellet. An aliquot of about 5 to 10 
mL of the absorbing solution is inserted onto the bottom of the vessel in 
order to trap the products of the combustion reaction. Oxygen is used to 
pressurize the system from 20 to 30 atm [4]. 

Due to the high temperature generated from the combustion, it 
is necessary to cool down the system before removing the resulting 
solution, a step that usually requires water or an ice bath can be 
employed for this purpose [4].  



Chapter 1

?

The combustion bomb may be employed for combustible 
samples, although combusting reagent may be employed in order to 
extend the use of the combustion bomb for samples which are not easily 
combusted [4].  

The drawbacks associated to combustion bombs include the 
possibility of contamination with metals from the metallic parts of the 
device, the processing of one sample per time, reducing the sample 
throughput, and the need for an adequate absorbing solution, considering 
the analyte [4].  

Another combustion system that can be applied is the oxygen 
flask (Figure 3), also known as Schöniger flask or Schöniger system. 
The flask is a simple combustion system composed of a glass vessel 
containing oxygen at atmospheric pressure and an absorbing solution 
which is inserted at the bottom of the vessel [4, 33].

The sample (usually less than 100 mg) is wrapped with paper 
and positioned in a platinum holder for subsequent combustion; the 
system is pressurized with oxygen up to atmospheric pressure and 
closed for posterior combustion of the sample. The ignition of the 
sample is initiated by an electrical current applied to the Pt wire or by a 
focused infrared lamp; another option is the use of a piece of paper 
which is usually ignited before the introduction of the Pt holder into the 
vessel [33].  

Unlike the combustion bomb, there is a limitation of sample 
mass that can be used (which is considerably lower than that for the 
combustion bomb), which means that analysis of samples containing 
trace levels of the analyte may be compromised. Moreover, the system 
requires constant monitoring during the sample pretreatment and 
contamination from the materials used for the combustion may be 
expected [33] 

More recently, MIC has been introduced as a sample 
pretreatment technique that can be applied for to a wide range of 
analytes and matrices including, for example, soil and carbon nanotubes 
(which were successfully combusted by this technique after proper 
optimization of the operating parameters) [4, 32]. In MIC, an aliquot of 
the sample is combusted inside of a quartz vessel pressurized with 
oxygen; the ignition is started by microwave irradiation. Similarly to 
other combustion techniques, in MIC the gases resulting from the 
combustion are absorbed in a solution, although in MIC the absorbing 
solution is subject to reflux [32]. 

The MIC system (Figure 4) is basically a combination of a 
commercially available microwave oven for wet sample digestion and 
the combustion techniques. The samples are prepared as pellets and 
positioned on top of a small piece of low-ash filter paper in a quartz 
holder. An ammonium nitrate solution is added as an igniter and the 
system is then closed, pressurized with oxygen to 15 to 25 atm and then 
the microwave radiation (maximum power of 1400 W) is applied to start 
the combustion [4, 32].

Once the combustion starts, it is not possible to stop the 
reaction. Thus, rupture disks are used in the cap to release the pressure 
of the system in case of ‘violent’ reactions. The quartz vessels are the 
same as those used for conventional digestion procedures using a 
microwave oven. Contamination is reduced by the use of quartz instead 
of stainless steel, which is normally used in the combustion bomb [4, 
32].  

Temperatures of about 1300 oC are reached during the 
combustion of the sample (this temperature is also reached using a 
combustion bomb), which is suitable for most applications [4]. 

The absorbing solution is added at the bottom of the vessel in 
order to absorb the products generated from the combustion. After the 
system is cooled down the solution can be removed, diluted and 
analyzed [4,32].  



  Chapter 1

Opposite to the combustion techniques where the total 
degradation of the sample is aimed at, extraction procedures or even 
partial degradation of the samples have also demonstrated to be 
applicable in the context of halogen determination, with the advantage 
of simplicity and low cost when compared to the combustion techniques 
[4].  

Sample pretreatment in alkaline media employing, for example, 
tetramethylammonium hydroxide and heating, or even diluted acids 
concomitantly with ultra-sound energy have gained interest and, in 
several cases, provided results that were comparable to those obtained 
using combustion techniques [31, 34]. 

The use of alkaline media has been successfully applied for 
sample pretreatment of botanical and biological samples for posterior 
halogen determination [35-36]. In this method, TMAH and heating were 
employed, promoting the partial decomposition and partial or complete 
solubilization of the sample, allowing analysis by ICP-MS after proper 
selection of the sample introduction system [37]. 

The employment of alkaline media sample pretreatment for 
halogen determination presents the advantage of avoiding the formation 
of volatile halogen compounds, such as HCl, which are easily formed in 
acidic media [37]. The procedure is also simple and fast, allowing high 
sample throughput and reducing the risk of contamination.  

Analyte extraction may replace sample decomposition in 
several applications. Ultrasound energy and diluted acids are normally 
employed in order to extract the analytes from the matrix, resulting in 
methods that are simple and associated to high sample throughput [38]. 
However, the use of diluted acids may lead to the formation of volatile 
forms of halogens. 

A very attractive alternative for halogen determination, that 
does not involve laborious sample pretreatment, is the use of direct solid 
sample analysis, which will be further described.  

1.3.2. Direct solid sample analysis  

Although sample pretreatment procedures are considered well-
established and accepted, solid and slurry sample analysis present 
advantages over procedures based on wet sample pretreatment [39]. The 
associated benefits are summarized below: 



Chapter 1 

14 

?

1. decreased risk of contamination, since the amount of 
reagents used is reduced or eliminated and the sample 
handling is significantly reduced; 

2. increased detection capability, since the sample is not 
diluted; 

3. reduced risk of analyte loss; 
4. increased sample throughput; 
5. reduced need for special apparatus for sample 

pretreatment;  
6. contributes to the environment, since little or no toxic 

or corrosive reagents are required; 
7. allows the study of microhomogeneity. 

Solid sample analysis may be accomplished by using the 
sample as a powder or in situ; a few techniques may require some 
sample pretreatment in order to produce pellets or another form that is 
suitable for introduction into the instrument [39].

It is clear that direct solid sample analysis presents several 
advantages over the traditional sample pretreatment procedures by the 
simple fact that no sample pretreatment is required, although direct solid 
sample analysis normally requires more from the quantification 
technique than an analysis carried out after the sample pretreatment, as 
the matrix of the sample is not destroyed. 

In general, interferences are expected to increase when using 
solid sampling analysis, including those that would not be present while 
analyzing a digested sample, due to the presence of relatively large 
quantities of the matrix [39]. Other difficulties that have limited the 
application of solid sample analysis are based on the fact that only a few 
instrumental techniques are powerful enough to analyze liquid and solid 
samples, and normally for those techniques, special apparatus for solid 
sample analysis are required, and problems with sample homogeneity 
are intensified at low masses. 

Matrix components are responsible for spectral interferences 
(which will be discussed further) and non-spectral interferences; hence, 
the analytical technique must be able to avoid or deal with possible 
interferences. The extent of the effect that may be exerted by the sample 
matrix is a function of the sample mass introduced in the equipment.  



  Chapter 1 

15 

?

The use of micro amounts of sample is normally preferred; however, a 
compromise must be considered in order to reduce the effect of 
heterogeneity of the sample. Typical precision values are expected to be 
up to 15% of relative standard deviation (RSD), which are considered 
acceptable for direct solid sample analysis [39-40]. 

Ideally, the behavior of the analyte in the samples should be the 
same as the behavior of the analyte in the standards. However, this 
statement is, sometimes, difficult to achieve using solid sample analysis 
when aqueous standards are used for calibration, since the chemical 
form of the analyte in the solid sample normally differs significantly 
from the chemical form of the analyte in aqueous standards [39]. On 
occasions, calibration has to be carried out against a solid sample, such 
as a certified reference material (CRM) [40]. 

Different approaches can be performed in order to achieve 
accurate results, such as the use of different calibrations approaches and 
equipments that allow for the destruction of the matrix of the sample in 
situ as SS-ETV-ICP-MS. 

Other effects that can be expected from the analysis of solid 
samples are difficulties associated to non-homogeneous distribution of 
the analyte, since the amount of sample is considerably reduced [40]. 

1.3.3. Instrumental analysis 

The choice of the technique for halogen determination is also 
considered critical due to the limited number of options that are suitable 
for this task, particularly when the analytes are expected to be present at 
trace levels [4, 28].  

The quantification of halogens may be carried out by different 
techniques, including ion chromatography (IC) [41] and ion-selective 
electrodes [42]. Both techniques require the analyte to be in aqueous 
medium and in ionic form, which implies the fact that sample 
pretreatment is required in order to solubilize the analytes properly.  In 
order to avoid the sample pretreatment step, halogens quantification in 
solid samples may be performed by techniques such as instrumental 
neutron activation analysis [43], X-ray fluorescence spectrometry [44] 
and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy [45].  

A few disadvantages are frequently related to these techniques, 
including low sensitivity, low sample throughput, limitations for multi 



Chapter 1

?

element analysis, incidence of interferences and short linear range for 
quantification.  

In order to fill the gap associated to alternatives for halogen 
determination, techniques such as high resolution continuum source 
molecular absorption spectrometry (HR-CS MAS) [46] and ICP-MS 
[27, 28] were recently proposed for halogen determination, offering high 
sensitivity, high sample throughput, and, in the case of ICP-MS, multi 
element character and a wide linear range for quantification. 
Nevertheless, there are only a few examples of the application of these 
techniques for halogen determination in the literature. 

Isotope ratio measurements of halogens, which is normally 
limited to Br and Cl, are even more complex to be performed, and the 
amount of techniques that can be applied for this purpose is very limited.  

 These techniques include isotope ratio mass spectrometry 
(IRMS) [48], negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry (NCIMS) 
[49], thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) [50, 51] and one 
application example using HR-CS MAS [52]. Unfortunately, these 
techniques are characterized by a number of drawbacks, such as the 
need for time-consuming sample preparation procedures, the occurrence 
of memory effect and/or poor precision. 

Positive thermal ionization mass spectrometry (PTIMS), 
relying on the monitoring of the polyatomic Cs2Cl

+, has been applied 
to the measurement of Cl isotope ratio in different standards and 
water samples. However, it was demonstrated that the technique 
suffers from mass fractionation depending on the Cl concentration 
[53].

In the case of this work, MC-ICP-MS, which is a powerful 
technique for high-precision isotopic analysis, was used. However, 
application of MC-ICP-MS for halogen isotope ratio measurements 
is limited to a few examples in the literature, typically using sample 
introduction systems that allow the insertion of a “dry” vapor into the 
plasma [54, 55]. 

1.4. Short overview about ICP-MS 

ICP-MS is a powerful analytical technique with the ability to 
perform multi-element analysis at trace levels and in a large variety of 
sample types [56]. 



  Chapter 1 

17 

?

The basic principle of ICP-MS is the detection of analytes 
which are separated based on their mass charge ratio (m/z) following 
ionization in an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) [5].  

A typical analytical routine in ICP-MS begins with aspiration of 
the sample and aerosol formation that takes place in the sample 
introduction system. A conventional sample introduction system for 
ICP-MS is composed of a nebulizer and a spray chamber, which are 
commercially available with different geometries [5, 56-57]. 

The nebulizers typically used in ICP-MS are classified as 
pneumatic (PN) and ultrasonic nebulizers. In PN, the aerosol is formed 
owing to the interaction between the liquid sample flow and a an Argon 
gas flow at high speed, while in ultrasonic nebulization the aerosol of 
the sample is formed as a result of contact of the liquid sample to an 
ultrasonic transducer, the sample introduction efficiency for these 
nebulizers can range from about 2 to 20% [5, 56-58]. 

Immediately after formation, the aerosol droplet diameters are 
heterogeneously distributed, which often results in the formation of a 
dense aerosol. In order to reduce the diameter and homogenize the 
droplets that reach the ICP, the nebulizer is connected to a spray 
chamber, which allows only small droplets to reach the plasma, hence 
facilitating the desolvation step that takes place immediately afterwards 
in the plasma [5, 56]. As a consequence, the steps of dissociation and 
ionization are also benefited, and the deleterious effects that derive from 
the addition of water droplets in the plasma are minimized. Typical 
spray chamber designs include the Scott type (or double pass) and 
cyclonic type and, in some cases, a combination of the Scott type with a 
cyclonic spray chamber [57]. 

Once the aerosol has passed the spray chamber, the droplets are 
carried to the central channel of the plasma, where the processes of 
desolvation, volatilization, atomization and ionization take place [5, 57]. 
Argon plasmas are typically used in ICP-MS instruments. The plasma is 
initially formed by an electrical discharge and is maintained by the 
energy coupled to it by a radio frequency (RF) generator. The 
temperature in the plasma may be as high as 10,000 K in the induction 
zone and from 5,000 to 7,000 K in the central channel of plasma due to 
the insertion of the cold aerosol of the sample [5]. 

The ions formed in the ICP are extracted to a region of high 
vacuum after passing through a region of intermediate vacuum that

normally contains two cones, a sampler and a skimmer cone. The ions 
are extracted from the interface and guided to the mass spectrometer by 
an ion optic system, which also stops particles, neutral species and 
photons from entering the mass analyser and the detector [59]. 

 The most common mass analyzer is the quadrupole due to its 
low cost and simplicity when compared to other commercially available 
mass analyzer [5, 57]. The main drawback associated to quadrupole 
mass analyzers is the low mass resolution (about 300u) and its non-
simultaneous detection of different isotopes. Mass analyzers based on 
the combination of magnetic and electric sectors (double focusing) are 
better suited when a higher mass resolution is required to separate the 
analyte ions from interfering ions. In these mass analyzers, the ions are 
spatially separated according to their m/z ratio [60] and might be 
simultaneously detected if more than one detector is available in the 
equipment. 

Once the ions are selected by the mass analyzer, they reach the 
detector and generate an electrical signal that will be further processed. 
Electron multipliers are the detectors normally employed in single 
collector instruments, whereas Faraday cups are preferred for MC-ICP-
MS [60-61]. 

Analysis using ICP-MS may be hindered by interferences. 
Spectral interferences, such as those originating from the formation of 
polyatomic ions in the plasma environment, are fairly common and 
require special instrumentation or operating conditions to be eliminated. 
These include the use of a collision and/or reaction cell in quadrupole-
based instruments, mathematical equations based on the signal measured 
at alternative m/z ratios, changes in the plasma conditions and use of 
high-resolution mass spectrometers.   

Non-spectral interferences, on the other hand, are somehow less 
predictable than spectral interferences. They lead to a suppression or 
enhancement of the analyte signal due to the effects in the processes of 
aspiration and nebulization of the sample, ionization of the analyte and 
transmission and detection of the ions [5, 62]. In general, non-spectral 
interferences may be corrected for by the adoption of calibration 
standards prepared in the same medium as the samples. Alternatives 
such as the use of standard addition calibration, internal standards or 
isotope dilution (ID) calibration [5] may be advantageously used.

1.4.1. Isotope ratio measurements by MC-ICP-MS 

The ability of obtaining isotopic information makes ICP-MS an 
attractive technique to perform isotope ratio analysis. In this approach, 
two or more isotopes of a given element are measured in order to 
provide information on induced or natural changes in one or more 
isotopes ratio. Isotope ratio measurements may, e.g. be employed to 
determine the age of geological materials, to assist in understanding 
environmental and biological reaction mechanisms and to identify 
contamination sources. [60, 63].  

Unfortunately, the application range of isotope ratio analysis 
using quadrupole ICP-MS is limited by the relatively low precision, 
normally higher than 0.1% RSD for “traditional” quadrupole based ICP-
MS and about 0.05% RSD for quadrupole based ICP-MS equipped with 
collision/reaction cell due to the temporal homogenization of the ions 
before they reach the detector [63]. The main disadvantages of 
quadrupole based ICP-MS equipment for isotopic analysis are basically 
the non-simultaneous isotope monitoring and the non-flat peak shape, in 
addition to other instrumental peculiarities that include low resolution 
and detector issues. 

In this sense, the use of MC-ICP-MS it preferred due to (i) its 
capability to measure different isotopes of the same element 
simultaneously, which implies that plasma instabilities will not affect 
the measured isotope ratio; (ii) the occurrence of flat-shaped peaks, 
avoiding variations in the measured signal due to small shifts in the 
position of the signal maximum and (iii) special instrumental 
peculiarities that increase the stability of the measurements [60].  

The simultaneous monitoring of isotopes is of great importance 
for isotope ratio measurements, since fluctuations in the signals are 
likely to happen for both isotopes at the same time. This feature is 
possible due to the use of a double-focusing mass analyzer with Nier–
Johnson geometry, which simultaneously separates the isotopes in space 
within a given mass window, and multiple detectors positioned after the 
mass analyzer, each one monitoring a different isotope [61, 63].  

Another important characteristic of MC-ICP-MS is the flat-
shaped peak, obtained by maintaining the width of the exit slit (collector 
slit) at a higher aperture than the entrance slit (source slit) [63]. A side 
effect from this approach is the “deterioration” of the equipment’s 



Chapter 1 

20 

?

resolution. In this case, peaks that are usually separated using a single 
collector high resolution ICP-MS instrument are often not completely 
separated using MC-ICP-MS. Therefore, the instrument is said to 
operate in “pseudo” medium or high resolution. However, in most cases, 
a mass window (shoulder) in the signal where the contribution of the 
signal comes solely from the analyte is observed, which is sufficient to 
carry out precise isotope ratio measurements [63]. 

In addition to the basic instrumental requirements for high 
precision isotope analysis by MC-ICP-MS, other effects, such as mass 
discrimination, matrix effects and interferences, need to be counteracted 
in order to allow accurate and precise results. Once the elements have 
been ionized in the ICP, the ions are extracted into the mass 
spectrometer and transmitted for posterior detection. Mass 
discrimination may occur during these steps, resulting in inaccurate 
results regarding the true isotope ratio. Non-conventional sample 
introduction systems, such as desolvator systems and vapor generation, 
certain sample preparation processes and matrix effects may also induce 
different degrees of mass discrimination [60]. 

Several approaches have been proposed to correct for mass 
discrimination, although this is still a challenge and sometimes the 
correction presents some pitfalls. Common approaches adopted to 
correct for mass discrimination effect are discussed below. 

External correction using a standard with a well-known isotope 
ratio may be useful. In this case, the standard-sample-standard 
bracketing approach is used, where the isotope ratio related to the 
sample is measured, and this measurement is preceded and followed by 
the measurement of an isotopic standard with a known isotopic 
composition. In order to apply this method for correction, the 
concentration of the analyte in the sample and standards must be as 
similar as possible, ideally not exceeding 30% of difference. However, 
this theoretical limit may vary depending on the analyte, matrix 
composition, sample introduction system used and instrumental setup. 
Since the matrix may influence the magnitude of mass discrimination, it 
is advisable that both (sample and standards) present the same matrix 
composition, which can be achieved by the isolation of the analyte from 
the sample [60, 63]. 

Correction using an internal standard is also feasible. In this 
approach, a known concentration of an element (with a known isotopic 



  Chapter 1 

21 

?

composition and a similar mass to that of the element for which the 
isotope ratio will be measured) is added to the sample solution. The bias 
between the measured and the known isotope ratios of the standard is 
used to determine the mass discrimination factor per unit of mass, which 
can be subsequently used to correct the isotope ratio of the analyte in the 
sample [60, 63]. 

All elements show isotope fractionation in environmental or 
biological processes, a few elements show isotope fractionation due to 
radiogenic decay, as for example, 87Sr which is a result from 87Rb decay. 
In this case, the 88Sr/86Sr ratio does not suffer variation and may be used 
in order to correct for mass discrimination [60, 63] – a procedure known 
as ‘internal correction’. 

In a brief look at the current literature, it is possible to find 
different approaches that have been proposed for mass discrimination 
correction, demonstrating that there is still some discussion in order to 
find the most suitable and accurate approach. As the mass fractionation 
depends on different factors including the analyte and matrix, it is 
possible that the most suitable approach for correction varies from case 
to case. 

After correction, the isotope ratio is usually represented as the 
ratio associated to the measured isotopes or relative to a standard or 
sample, termed as ? values, which is calculated according to Equation 1 
[63]: 

????? ?
??	
??
????	??	??

???	??	??
?? ????     (Equation 1) 

In Equation 1, Rsample refers to the isotope ratio of the element in 
the sample and Rstandard is the isotope ratio of the element in the standard. 

1.4.2. Halogen determination by ICP-MS 

Quantitative determination of halogens by ICP-MS is usually 
not a trivial task, mainly due to issues associated with sample 
pretreatment, memory effect when using conventional sample 
introduction systems, relatively low sensitivity (when compared to the 
typical ICP-MS sensitivity for other elements of the periodic table) and 
the presence of spectral interferences [64].  



Chapter 1 

22 

?

Memory effect is a critical issue for halogen determination by 
ICP-MS, especially when acidic solutions are used [65], which is likely 
due to the formation of volatile species, such as HX (X=Cl, Br and I). In 
order to reduce the memory effect, a few strategies may be adopted, 
including the use of alternative sample introduction systems and specific 
washout solutions that should be employed between successive 
measurements cycles [36].    

The relatively low sensitivity associated to halogen 
determination by ICP-MS results from their high ionization energy 
(17.42 eV for F, 12.97 eV for Cl, 11.81 eV for Br and 10.45 eV for I), 
and hence, low ionization efficiencies (in the order of 30, 5 and 0.9% for 
I, Br and Cl, respectively). Fluorine is the most critical halogen to be 
analyzed by ICP-MS, since negligible populations of F+ are formed in 
Ar plasma. Quantification of F by ICP-MS may be accomplished using a 
He plasma [47] or using a non-conventional approach monitoring 
negative ions by ICP-MS [66], but reports on F analyse by means of 
ICP-MS are scarce. 

Spectral interferences associated to halogens quantification by 
ICP-MS are due to the formation of polyatomic ions, which include 
16O18O1H+ and 34S1H+ overlapping with the m/z of 35Cl+; 36Ar1H+ and 
36S1H+, overlapping with the m/z of 37Cl+; 40Ar39K+, 31P16O3

+ and 
38Ar40Ar1H+ overlapping with the m/z of 79Br+ and 32S16O3

1H+, 
40Ar40Ar1H+ and 33S16O3

+ overlapping with the m/z of 81Br+ also 
jeopardizes the determination of halogens by ICP-MS, mainly in low 
resolution mode. The impact of these polyatomic ion interferences 
depend on the sample introduction system and on the sample matrix, 
since K, P and S are easily found at relatively high concentrations in 
several matrices, Ar is the plasma gas and O and H come from water and 
other reagents used for sample preparation. 

An alternative to avoid the undesired effects associated to 
halogen determination by ICP-MS include the use of direct solid sample 
analysis with devices such as laser ablation (LA-ICP-MS). However, 
problems regarding calibration strategy for quantification, isotope 
fractionation for isotopic analysis, and instrumental cost are still 
significant [60, 69]. 

Electrothermal vaporization – inductively coupled plasma – 
mass spectrometry (ETV-ICP-MS) has proved to be an efficient 
approach for direct solid sample analysis, especially for quantitation of 



  Chapter 1 

23 

?

volatile elements and/or for the analysis of samples that are not suitable 
for conventional sample preparation protocols [69]. The use of 
electrothermal vaporization (ETV) adds the possibility to remove the 
major matrix load during the pyrolysis step and the use of aqueous or 
solid standards for calibration. 

 The fact that devices especially designed for solid sample 
analysis by ETV-ICP-MS are not commercially available has limited the 
number of publications and applications of this technique to only a few 
examples that are available in the literature, thus, this field of research is 
believed to be very promising and still holds potential for exploitation. 

Antes et al. (2013) have developed a system for direct solid 
analysis by ETV-ICP-MS. The system was applied with success for the 
determination of Cl in petroleum coke using standard addition 
calibration in order to correct for differences in the behavior of the 
analyte in the sample and in the calibration standards [69]. The first 
application of the ETV for halogen determination was described by Yan 
et al. (1996). In their work, an ETV was developed and successfully 
employed for the determination of Br, Cl and I in aqueous standards 
using a He-Ar plasma, resulting in a more energetic plasma, and 
therefore, better sensitivity for halogen determination using ICP-MS 
[47]. 

1.4.3. Solid sample analysis by ICP-MS 

Direct analysis of solids by ICP-MS is usually accomplished by 
using either a laser ablation system (LA-ICP-MS) (Figure 5) or, less 
common ETV-ICP-MS. 

Analysis by LA is based on the focusing of a laser beam on the 
surface of the sample, which is kept in an inert atmosphere. The pulsed 
laser converts part of the sample in an aerosol or vapor, which is carried 
by an inert gas to the ICP [70]. 

Application of LA extends to several fields of research and is 
particularly popular in geochemistry, where LA-ICP-MS has become 
one the main techniques for multielemental determination and isotopic 
dating, besides being able to map the distribution of chemical elements 
in the samples.

spectrometry in archaeometric research, p. 55–78, 2010, Copyright

The main disadvantage associated to the use of LA is the 
difficulty to attain a suitable calibration approach for quantification due 
to the need for standards with the same characteristics of the samples 
[70]. Therefore, differences in vapor formation and transportation 
between sample and standards may lead to errors, requiring special 
approaches for calibration using this technique [60].  

Another drawback of the technique is related to the cost of the 
equipment when compared to other sample introduction systems, 
besides that isotope fractionation is more likely to occur in these systems 
[60]. 

All in all, LA has been applied successfully for halogen 
determination by several authors in several matrices presenting the goal 
of performing spatially resolved analysis. Most of the authors have used 
isotope dilution ID as a calibration approach to counteract the 
differences between samples and standards [71, 72].

On the other hand, the use of ETV-ICP-MS may expand the 
possibilities for direct solid quantification by ICP-MS, enabling the use 



  Chapter 1

of aqueous standards for calibration and the sample pretreatment in situ
[39]. 

In ETV-ICP-MS (Figure 6), an aliquot of the sample is inserted 
into a graphite furnace (GF) and a temperature program is applied. The 
temperature program functions as an in situ sample pretreatment step 
inside of the GF, allowing the elimination of the solvents (in the case of 
liquid and slurry samples) during a drying step and the elimination of 
the matrix of the sample during a pyrolysis step. After the solvents and 
matrix of the sample have been eliminated, the analytes are volatized 
and carried to the plasma during the vaporization step [73].

Elmer [73]. Reprinted from Anal. Chim. Acta, Vol. 648, Aramendía, M.;

coupled plasma-mass spectrometry: A versatile tool for tackling

The working principle of an ETV is similar to the principle of 
electrothermal atomizers used in atomic absorption spectrometry. 
Probably the main difference is that no atomization is required, but only 
the vaporization of the analytes and their efficient transport to the ICP. 
 In ETV, an aliquot of the sample, typically 5-50 µL for liquid 
samples and about 0.5 - 1 mg for solid samples, is inserted into the 
vaporizer cell which is resistively heated when in contact with graphite 
electrodes [73]. In order to vaporize the samples, the electrodes 
connected to the vaporizer cell provide energy capable to produce 



Chapter 1

temperatures as high as 2,800 oC (for example), which is suitable for the 
vaporization of most elements of the periodic table. Once vaporized, the 
analytes and eventually other concomitants from the matrix are carried 
to the ICP by a carrier gas flow (normally Ar) [73]. 
 Typically, in ETV-ICP-MS a temperature program is applied, 
which includes drying, pyrolysis and vaporization steps. During the 
drying step, solvents and products with lower volatilization temperatures 
from the sample are eliminated, whereas in the pyrolysis step the main 
objective is to eliminate matrix components, preventing them to be 
carried to the ICP during the vaporization step [73, 74].  
 The pyrolysis step must be carefully optimized in order to 
prevent plasma loading without promoting the concomitant vaporization 
of the analyte. Chemical modifiers may be used to increase the thermal 
stability of the analyte, allowing the use of elevated pyrolysis 
temperatures, and improve the analyte transfer from the ETV to the ICP. 
Chemical modifiers may be used either as a solution, in which case the 
modifier is co-injected with each sample aliquot, or it may be deposited 
onto the graphite tube surface, providing thermal stability to the analytes 
and /or acting as an aerosol carrier [39, 74].  

The vaporization step follows pyrolysis, volatilizing the 
analytes that are then carried to the ICP. During the pyrolysis step 
(Figure 6A) the internal gas flow flushes all the vapors out of the 
vaporizer cell, while during the vaporization step (Figure 6B) the orifice 
of the vaporizer cell is sealed by a graphite tip and the internal gas flow 
carries the analytes to the ICP [39, 74].  

The use of ETV is suitable for analysis of liquid, slurry and 
solid samples (using a special apparatus for insertion of the sample into 
the graphite tube). Völkopf et al. have developed the “cup-in-tube” 
technique, with the purpose of introducing solid samples directly into 
the graphite tube [74]. In this technique, the sample is weighed inside of 
glass capillary tubes and transferred into the cup that can be inserted in 
the graphite tube (Figure 7).

The advantages of the use of ETV-ICP-MS are the possibility 
of analysis of micro sized samples, high transport efficiency of analytes 
to the plasma when compared to conventional sample introduction 
systems, possibility to analyze organic samples and also samples with 
high solid content, possibility of calibration using aqueous standards, 
possibility of analysis of solid and slurry samples and separation of the 
analyte from the matrix of the sample due to the temperature program 
applied, reducing the risk of interferences [39-40,74]. 

In quantitative analysis using SS-ETV-ICP-MS, the calibration 
strategies include external calibration against aqueous standards, solid 
standards (CRMs), by standards addition, with or without internal 
standards, and ID [74]. 

The use of external calibration with aqueous standards, which is 
widely used for quantification of trace elements in digested samples, is a 
very attractive alternative for quantification by ICP-MS. However, in 
SS-ETV-ICP-MS this approach is sometimes not feasible, since the 
analytes in the sample are normally present in a different form than the 
analytes in the aqueous standards, resulting in different thermal behavior 
[39]. Calibration using solid standards, mainly using CRMs with similar 
composition to that of the samples, may result in better accuracy due to 
the similarity of the matrices [69].  

Under special circumstances, standard addition calibration may 
be used when solid standards are not available [69]. ID may also be 
helpful in these cases, although it requires isotopically enriched 
standards, which are expensive.

2.1. Introduction 

Chlorine is regularly produced by industries worldwide and has 
applications that range from purification of drinking water to the 
production of bleached paper, plastics, solvents and pharmaceuticals 
[76].  

Given the widespread use of Cl, exposition to the element 
occurs frequently due to manipulation of products, transportation or 
even due to environmental contamination [76, 77]. According to the 
Agency for Toxic Substances &amp;amp; Disease Registry, exposure to Cl may 
affect the respiratory tract and eyes, causing acute irritation and 
triggering inflammatory processes [78].  

Monitoring of Cl in biological and botanical materials is 
characterized by difficulties that extend from sample pretreatment until 
the final instrumental determination [79].  

Sample preparation must be carefully conducted in order to 
avoid contamination and analyte loss; acid digestion, which is most 
frequently used as a sample treatment procedure, is not recommended 
due to the formation of HCl, which can be lost by volatilization. 
Moreover the instrumental determination frequently suffers from poor 
sensitivity, risk of interferences, low analytical throughput and, on 
occasions, high analytical cost [69, 47, 79 - 81]. 

Hence, the goal of this work was to develop a method for the 
direct determination of Cl in biological and botanical samples using SS-
ETV-ICP-MS, including a systematic investigation of calibration 
protocols. 

  
2.2. Experimental 

2.2.1. Instrumentation 

All experiments were carried out using an Elan ICP-MS, 
equipped with an HGA-600 MS electrothermal vaporizer and an AS-60 
autosampler (Perkin-Elmer SCIEX, Thornhill, Canada). Platinum 
sampling and skimmer cones were used, the optimized conditions of the 
ICP-MS were 1300W of RF power, 0.7 L min-1 of nebulizer gas flow, 
1.2 L min-1 of auxiliary gas, 15.0 L min-1 of main gas, dwell time for the 
readings of 50 ms, detector voltages of 1250 V for pulse mode and -
2280 V for analogue mode.  



Chapter 2

?

All measurements were carried out in Peak Hopping scanning 
mode and autolens mode on. The ‘cup-in-tube’ technique described by 
Vollkopf et al. [75] was used, where the sample introduction opening of 
the pyrolytically coated graphite tube is enlarged so that the sampling 
‘cup’ can be inserted directly into the GF using Teflon tweezers.  

The solid sampling cup is made from high-density 
electrographite and coated with pyrolytic graphite and has approximate 
dimensions of 7.0 x 4.5 x 6.8 mm, and it supports a maximum of 160 
mg of sample [75]. The solid sampling cups, loaded with the sample 
(using a glass capillary), were inserted into the graphite tube and 
removed after completion of the analysis using a special apparatus. 

  The solid samples were weighed using a micro balance model 
M2P (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany). Argon with a purity of 99.996% 
(White Martins, São Paulo, Brazil) was used as plasma, carrier and 
internal gas of the ETV. 

In order to provide comparative results for samples with 
unknown Cl concentration, a ContrAA 600 high-resolution continuum 
source atomic absorption spectrometer (Analytik Jena AG, Jena, 
Germany) with a transversely heated graphite tube atomizer was used. 
The SrCl molecule was used for quantitative measurements of Cl at 
635.863 nm, using integrated absorbance of three pixels (peak volume 
selected absorbance (PVSA) A?3,int).  

Pyrolytically coated graphite tubes (Analytik Jena) were used 
in all experiments. The solid samples were weighed directly onto solid 
sampling platforms (Analytik Jena) using an M2P micro balance. A 
manual solid sampling system, SSA 6 (Analytik Jena), was used to 
insert the SS platforms into the graphite tube. The optimized pyrolysis 
and vaporization temperatures for the HR-CS MAS technique were 
600oC and 2300oC, respectively. 

2.2.2.  Reagents, standards and samples  

All reagents used were at least of analytical grade. Deionized 
water was obtained from a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, 
USA) with a resistivity of ?18.2 M? cm. Individual stock standard 
solutions containing 1000 mg L-1 of Ca or Cl were obtained from 
Quimilab (São Paulo, Brazil). A 1000 mg L-1 Pd stock standard solution 
from Sigma-Aldrich (Missouri, US), a 1000 mg L-1 Nd (Spex, New 
Jersey, US), Sr (Vetec, Duque de Caxias, Brazil) and Zr  solution 
(Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) were used. The liquid samples and

modifiers (at a concentration of 1000 mg L-1) were automatically 
inserted into the GF in 20 µL aliquots using the autosampler. 

 The following Standard Reference materials (SRM) were used: 
Corn Bran (SRM 8433), Bovine Muscle Powder (SRM 8414), Whole 
Egg Powder (SRM 8415), Wheat Flour (SRM 1567a), Bovine Liver 
(SRM 1577b) and Non-Fat Milk Powder (SRM 1549) all from NIST 
(Gaithersburg, USA); Pig Kidney (BCR 186) and Mussel Tissue (BCR 
278R), both from IRMM (Geel, Belgium) and Beef Liver (NCS-ZC 
71001) from NACIS (Beijing, China). 

2.2.3. Analytical procedure 

Carrier gas flow rate, RF power and pyrolysis and vaporization 
temperatures (Tp and Tv, respectively) were optimized using the 
certified sample SRM 8414 for solid sampling studies as the 
concentration of Cl in this sample is within the concentrations expected 
in the samples. A 50 mg L-1 Cl solution was also used to investigate the 
experimental parameters.  

The use of modifiers was evaluated by pipetting Pd and the 
mixture of Ca + Pd and Nd + Pd as acidic aqueous solutions directly 
onto the solid samples. For comparison, the modifiers were also pre-
dried into the sampling cup, prior to insertion of the solid samples or 
aqueous standards. For the studies involving aqueous solutions, 10 µL 
aliquots of each modifier were added concomitantly to the samples.  

Alternatively, the sampling cup was pre-treated with a total of 
200 µg Pd as permanent modifier (10 injections of 20 µL of the stock 
solution). Calcium and Nd were then pre-dried using a Tp of 1000oC 
[82], before the addition of each sample. 

Chlorine determination in SRM was carried out using 
calibration against aqueous or solid standards using Pd + Nd or Pd + Ca 
pre-dried as modifiers and also without modifier using a solid standard. 
The calibration range extended from 0.2 to 3.0 µg Cl. All measurements 
were carried out monitoring the isotope 35Cl.  

The heating temperature of the ETV is based on the 1: solvent 
and acid removal at 1,000oC for 10s when pre-dried modifiers were 
used, 2: insertion of the sample at 20oC, 3: Drying step at 100oC for 10s, 
4: Pyrolysis step at the optimal temperature for each modifier for 10 s 
and 5: Vaporization step at the optimal temperature for each modifier 
for 18 s. The whole process considering the removal and inserting of the 
cup containing the sample takes about 4 min.

In order to establish a comparison of the results with those 
from an alternative technique, the biological samples were directly 
weighed (approximately 0.05 to 0.5 mg) onto SS platforms, previously 
treated with a total of 400 µg (10 injections of 40 µL containing 40 µg 
of the modifier) of zirconium as a permanent chemical modifier. 
Subsequently, 10 µL (2% m/v) of the molecule-forming Sr solution (as 
SrCO3) was pipetted onto the biological samples and introduced into the 
GF to be submitted to the temperature program, aiming at the 
determination using HR-CS MAS.  

2.3. Results and discussion 

2.3.1. Optimization of ICP-MS operating parameters 

Initial experiments involved optimizing the ICP-MS 
parameters, which include the carrier gas flow rate and the plasma RF 
power, in addition to the evaluation of the short-term signal stability.  

 The carrier (internal) gas flow rate exerted significant 
influence on the analytical signal, as also observed by Antes et al. [69]. 
The analytical signal was found to be maximum at a carrier gas flow 
rate of 0.7 L min-1 (Figure 8a), and symmetrical peaks were observed 
under this condition. Higher gas flow rates resulted in significant 
decrease in sensitivity, suggesting that the transport efficiency of Cl 
from the ETV to the ICP is critically influenced by this parameter. 
Hence, a carrier gas flow rate of 0.7 L min-1 was selected for further 
experiments. 

 The RF power (Figure 8b) was also investigated, since the 
high ionization potential of Cl (12.97 eV) would require a 
proportionally high plasma power to provide optimum sensitivity. 
Increasing the RF power from 800 to 1300 W resulted in an increase in 
sensitivity by a factor of two, as expected. Hence, the RF power was 
maintained at 1300 W for further experiments.  

Considering the organic nature of the samples and the 
possibility of deposition of carbon on the cones with a direct effect on 
the analytical signal [69-72], a short-time stability study was conducted 
by adding mass aliquots of about 500 µg of the solid sample SRM 8414 
and monitoring the integrated signal for 40 min. In order to establish a 
comparison, an aqueous standard was also evaluated, and a relatively 
low pyrolysis temperature was adopted (200 oC) in order to simulate an 
extreme condition.

flow rate and 1300 W RF power. Each individual signal obtained from 
SS-ETV-ICP-MS was normalized to 1 mg of sample; individual counts 
were divided by the signal obtained in the first measurement in each 
series.

The results, shown in Figure 9, demonstrate that the analytical 
signal did not suffer from significant drift over the evaluated period, 
suggesting that the sample matrix was efficiently eliminated even at low 
pyrolysis temperatures and/or the residual matrix that was transported to 
the ICP could be fully decomposed prior to introduction of the ion 
stream into the MS. Visual inspection of the sampling and skimmer 
cones following this experiment has also attested the absence of 
deposited material, corroborating this assumption. 

2.3.2. Pyrolysis and vaporization temperatures 

The transient signals obtained by SS-ETV-ICP-MS using either 
aqueous standards or solid samples were symmetrical (slightly tailed) 
and relatively short even without the use of modifiers, as shown in 
Figure 10.  

Figure 10. Signal profile obtained by ETV-ICP-MS. Conditions: 
pyrolysis and vaporization temperatures 500 oC and 2000 oC, 
respectively; 0.7 L min-1 carrier gas flow rate and 1300 W RF power 
monitoring the isotope 35Cl: a) is aqueous standard signal for 1 µg of Cl 
and b) is solid standard RM 8414 for 0.2 µg of Cl both without the use 
of modifiers.  

Considering the difference in sensitivity that was detected 
between aqueous standards and solid samples observed in Figure 10, an 
evaluation of the effect of chemical modifiers was performed as an 
attempt to stabilize Cl in aqueous solutions and to equalize the 
sensitivity for both aqueous and solid standards, which would exert an 
important influence on the quantification process. 

Calcium and Nd were firstly evaluated, since these elements 
are known to form thermodynamically stable compounds with Cl and

the signal profile could be improved with the co-injection of 10 µg of 
Pd, which coincides with the findings of Resano et al. [82], who 
adopted the use of pre-dried Pd as a modifier to carry out iodine 
determination by ETV-ICP-MS.  

Considering these aspects, pyrolysis and vaporization curves 
were established in the absence of a modifier and also using Pd alone or 
its mixtures with Nd or Ca. The results are shown in Figure 11.

MS for Cl in aqueous standards (1 µg) and in the SRM 8414 (bovine

solid SRM using aqueous modifiers; (c)  aqueous standard using pre-
dried modifiers; (d) solid SRM using pre-dried modifiers. Each 
individual signal obtained from SS-ETV-ICP-MS was normalized to 1 
mg of sample; signals were also normalized to the highest signal 
achieved in each individual curve. Error bars present the RDS on the y 
scale.

higher than 200 ºC and/or contributed to an improved transport 
efficiency of the analyte to the ICP.  

Curiously, the sensitivity was significantly reduced when a 
mixture of Pd and Nd was employed, suggesting either a strong 
interaction of the analyte with the modifiers in the condensed phase, 
hence reducing the vaporization efficiency, or a reduction in transport 
efficiency of the analyte to the ICP.      

The effect of chemical modifiers pipetted onto solid SRM 8414 
is shown in Figure 11b. The curves demonstrate that the analytical 
signal tends to decrease with increasing pyrolysis temperature, 
suggesting that premature volatilization of the analyte occurs.  

The only condition that allowed the signal to be maintained 
approximately constant was the absence of a modifier. Overall, the 
results shown in Figures 11a and 11b demonstrate that the efficiency of 
chemical modifiers is somewhat limited and the performance is similar 
or worse than when no modifier is used in the process. A possible 
conclusion is that somehow the presence of nitric acid from the liquid 
modifiers medium is leading to the formation of HCl during the stages 
of thermal pre-treatment and, hence, results in premature loss of the 
analyte.  

In order to avoid any potential effect deriving from the 
presence of acids in the GF, the modifiers were pre-dried onto the 
internal surface on the solid sampling cup prior to insertion of the solid 
samples or aqueous standards. In this sense, Pd was thermally deposited 
onto the sampling cup by successive injections of the liquid modifier, 
followed by application of a specific temperature program in order to 
form a coating containing 200 µg of deposited Pd. The additional 
modifiers, Nd or Ca, were pre-dried onto the Pd-modified surface 
immediately before the injection or insertion of the samples [82].  

The results, shown in Figures 11c and 11d, demonstrate that the 
pre-dried modifiers allowed significant thermal stability for Cl to be 
achieved. Considering the aqueous standard, maximum pyrolysis 
temperatures of 600 oC using Pd + Nd and 700 oC using Pd + Ca 
(Figure 11c) could be used, whereas Cl in the solid SRM was 
maintained stable at up to 1000 ºC, using permanently deposited Pd 
mixed with either Ca or Nd, in their pre-dried forms.  

In general, higher stability was observed using the Nd or Ca co-
modifiers with Pd, which may be related to the high dissociation energy 
of the molecules formed between Cl and Nd or Ca [83].  Based on 
Figure 11, the optimized pyrolysis and vaporization temperatures used

for the determination were respectively, 200oC and 2000oC without the 
use of modifiers, 300oC and 2100oC using Pd as modifier, 600oC and 
1500oC using Pd + Nd pre-dried as modifier and 700oC and 1800oC 
using Pd + Ca pre-dried as modifier  

2.3.3. Evaluation of potential interference from sulfur on the 
analytical signal  

Sulfur may promote spectral interference at m/z 35 due to the 
formation of 1H34S+. Since sulfur may be present at relatively high 
concentrations in the analyzed samples, a simulation was carried out to 
evaluate whether any interference would occur under the conditions 
adopted in this work. Hence, an aqueous solution containing 250 mg L-1 

S was analyzed using a low Tp (200 oC), in order to prevent 
volatilization of the element during thermal pre-treatment. The resulting 
transient signal, measured at m/z = 35 and also at m/z 34 (for reference), 
is shown in Figure 12. 

The peak area values obtained at m/z 35 were similar to those 
observed from blank solutions, regardless of the chemical modifier 
adopted, which suggests that interference from polyatomic 1H34S+ is 
unlikely to occur.  

Figure 12. Signal obtained from the vaporization of 5.0 µg of S using 
SS-ETV-ICP-MS at m/z 34 and 35. Conditions: pyrolysis and

carrier gas flow rate and 1300 W RF power; no modifier was used.

2.3.4. Calibration and analytical accuracy  

Calibration against aqueous standards is a fast and simple 
approach, but the fundamental requirement is that the behavior of the 
analyte (i.e. the relative sensitivity) in aqueous standards and in the 
samples should be similar.  

However, analytical procedures employing SS frequently suffer 
from pronounced matrix effects deriving from the presence of 
significant amounts of matrix inside the GF [40]. The situation becomes 
even more complex when transportation between the ETV and the ICP 
is considered, since the solid particles from the matrix may assist in the 
process of nucleation and the transport efficiency from solid samples 
may be significantly better than from aqueous standards. 

Hence, in order to establish an adequate calibration procedure, 
calibration curves were obtained for a sample mass ranging from 0.1 to 
1.5 mg of the SRM 8414 (bovine muscle), corresponding the range 
from 0.188 µg to 2.820 µg of Cl, herewith denominated calibration 
against a solid sample, and also using aqueous standards resulting in the 
insertion of Cl masses that varied from 0.2 to 3.0 µg. Both calibration 
approaches were evaluated with and without the use of pre-dried 
modifiers, as discussed in the previous session. The resulting figures of 
merit are shown in Table 1.

In general, the use of aqueous modifiers resulted in lower linear 
correlation coefficients for the calibration curves (R &amp;lt;0.98) when 
compared to the linearity observed with the use of pre-dried modifiers. 
The sole use of permanently deposited Pd as a chemical modifier also 
resulted in a low linear correlation coefficient, regardless of the 
calibration approach adopted. Apparently, the interaction with the 
modifier and/or the transport efficiency in these cases is concentration-
dependent, resulting in polynomial calibration curves.  

The use of pre-dried Pd + Ca or Pd + Nd as chemical modifiers 
resulted in similar sensitivities for calibration against aqueous standards 
and against a solid SRM, suggesting that calibration against aqueous 
standards would be a feasible approach. In essence, it can be assumed 
that analyte interaction with the chemically modified surface is more 
significant than the analyte interaction with the matrix, an effect that 
ultimately normalizes the analyte thermal stability and the transport 
efficiency between aqueous solutions and the solid sample.   

As illustrated before (Figure 10), if no modifiers were used, 
lower signals resulted from the analysis of aqueous standards when 
compared to a solid SRM, even when the nominal analyte mass 
introduced into the furnace via the aqueous standard exceeded the Cl 
mass in the solid SRM. This was attributed to the loss of Cl during 
drying and pyrolysis steps, which were conducted at 100 oC and 500 oC, 
respectively. In contrast, the chemical interaction of chlorine species 
with the solid matrix appeared to be sufficient to maintain the analyte in 
the condensed phase under the conditions adopted in this work. 
Therefore, it is assumed that the used of modifiers is necessary when 
the use of aqueous standards is aimed. 

 The limit of quantification (LOQ) was calculated as 10 times 
the standard deviation of ten measurements of the empty SS cup divided 
by the slope of the calibration curve obtained, and adjusted to the 
average sample mass used in the analytical procedure. Using SS-ETV-
ICP-MS in this work a LOQ of  5 µg g-1 was achieved, which is 
comparable to that obtained by Antes et al. for petroleum coke samples 
(3.5 µg g-1), although using sample mass aliquots that are ten times 
higher than those typically used in this work.   

This means that the current approach, using pre-dried modifiers 
and calibration against aqueous standards, is about 10 times more 
sensitive than the method previously described, with significantly lower 
sample consumption [28]. 



Chapter 2 

42 

?

 Some other techniques which require sample pretreatment as 
pyrohydrolysis combined with IC can achieve LOQ of 1 µg g-1 [80]. 
However using a considerable mass of sample (1g) and the 
determination by HR-CS-GF-MAS after acid digestions using 100 mg 
achieving a LOQ of about 3 µg g-1 [84]. However those techniques 
require extra procedures, equipment, reagents and a relatively high mass 
of sample. 

Five SRMs were analyzed using calibration against a solid 
SRM and also against aqueous standards in the absence of a modifier 
and using pre-dried Pd + Nd or Pd + Ca. The results are presented in 
Table 2. As can be seen, the concentrations obtained using SS-ETV-
ICP-MS are in good agreement with the certified values at a 95% 
statistical confidence level, regardless of the calibration approach 
adopted.  

The fact that calibration against aqueous standards can be 
applied without compromising the accuracy and regardless of the nature 
of the sample is remarkable and it is described for the first time for the 
direct analysis of solid samples using SS-ETV-ICP-MS aiming at 
halogens determination.  

Three SRM without certified Cl concentrations were also 
analyzed using SS-ETV-ICP-MS. In these cases, the results were 
compared to those obtained from the analysis using HR-CS-GF-MAS 
(Table 3). The results from both techniques are in good agreement one 
another.

2.4. Conclusions 

 In order to avoid the typical problems related to Cl 
determination by the commonly employed instrumental and sample 
preparation techniques, the use of SS-ETV-ICP-MS may be regarded as 
a sensitive and accurate alternative. The methodology is relatively 
simple, since it does not require any time-consuming sample 
pretreatment. Calibration against solid reference materials or against 
aqueous standards using Pd + Nd or Pd + Ca was proven feasible for the 
determination of Cl in five certified standard materials and three non-
certified samples by SS-ETV-ICP-MS. The procedure may probably be 
extended to other biological or botanical samples.

3.1. Introduction 

Chlorine is essential for humans, animals and plants, and is a 
precious commercial article since ancient times, as it was used, among 
other things, for the conservation of food. Bromine, in contrast, has no 
known physiological function. Both elements, however, can also be 
highly toxic and hazardous to the environment, depending on the 
compound in which they are present and their concentration [1, 8, 9, 85-
87].  

Coal is a potential source of halogens due to the release of these 
elements to the atmosphere during combustion. The release of Br and Cl 
from coal is a serious concern, mainly because coal is, and probably will 
remain for quite some time, employed as a major source of energy in 
many countries [88]. The presence of these elements in coal, considering 
the increasing consumption of coal in the last decades, may represent a 
risk to the environment and consequently for living organisms [89-90].

In order to avoid the problems related to sample pretreatment 
and also to determine trace levels of Br and Cl, solid sample analysis 
may be carried out using ETV-ICP-MS, which leads to advantages, such 
as reduced risk of interference, greatly reduced risk of contamination, 
increased sensitivity and suitability as a simultaneous trace elemental 
analytical procedure [40]. 

Given the high importance of Br and Cl determination in coal 
samples and the feasibility of its determination using SS-ETV-ICP-MS, 
the aim of this work was to develop an analytical method for Br and Cl 
determination in coal samples using direct solid sample analysis. 

3.2. Experimental 

3.2.1. Instrumentation 

All experiments were carried out using an Elan 6000 
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer equipped with an HGA-
600 MS electrothermal vaporizer coupled to an autosampler model AS-
60 from Perkin-Elmer SCIEX (Thornhill, Canada). The cup-in-tube 
technique described by Vollkopf et al. [75] was used for solid sampling 
experiments. The samples were directly weighed into a solid sampling 
glass capillary using a micro-balance model M2P (Sartorius, Göttingen, 
Germany) and transferred to pyrolytically-coated graphite cups from 
Perkin-Elmer (Norwalk, USA).

The operating parameters of the ICP-MS instrument are listed 
in Table 4. Argon with a purity of 99.996% from White Martins (São 
Paulo, Brazil) was used as plasma, carrier and internal gas of the ETV.  

A Model contrAA 600 high-resolution continuum source 
atomic absorption spectrometer (Analytik Jena AG, Jena, Germany) 
with a transversely heated graphite tube atomizer was employed for 
comparison. Pyrolytically coated graphite tubes (Analytik Jena) were 
used in all experiments.

The solid samples were weighed directly onto solid sampling 
platforms (Analytik Jena) using the M2P micro-balance. A manual solid 
sampling system SSA 6 (Analytik Jena) was used to insert the SS 
platforms into the graphite tube. For the determination of Br, the 
optimized pyrolysis and vaporization temperatures were 800 and 2200 
°C, respectively, while for Cl determination the pyrolysis and 
vaporization temperatures were 600 oC and 2300 oC, respectively.  

The molecular absorption of CaBr molecule was measured at 
625.315 nm and the SrCl molecule was measured at 635.862 nm, both 
using integrated absorbance over three pixels  PVSA, A?3,int) [91]. 

3.2.2. Reagents, standards and samples  

All reagents used were at least of analytical grade. Deionized 
water was obtained from a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, 
USA) with a resistivity of 18.2 M? cm. Individual stock solutions

containing each 1000 mg L-1 Ca, Cl and Br were obtained from 
Quimilab (São Paulo, Brazil), Pd from Sigma-Aldrich (Missouri, USA) 
and Al, K, P, S and Sr  from Spex (New Jersey, USA). 

The coal CRMs used were BCR-180 and BCR-182 from IRMM 
(Geel, Belgium), NIST 1630a and NIST 1632b from National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST) (Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and 
Sarm-19 from South Africa Bureau of Standards (Randburg, South 
Africa). 

3.2.3. Analytical procedure 

Pyrolysis and vaporization temperatures of the ETV, the carrier 
gas flow rate and RF power of the ICP-MS were optimized using the 
CRM BCR-182 for the studies with direct SS analysis, and an aqueous 
solution containing Br and Cl.  

The modifiers studied were Pd and its corresponding mixtures 
with Ca and Al. In the latter cases, 200 ?g Pd was deposited in excess 
into the sampling cups (10 injections of 20 ?L of a solution containing 1 
g L-1) whereas Ca and Al were pre-dried using 20 ?L of a solution 
containing 1 g L-1 and applying the drying temperature of 100 oC and a 
pyrolysis temperature of 1000 oC before the addition of the samples 
[82].  

The quantification of Br and Cl in the CRM was carried out 
upon calibration using the CRM BCR-182; Br was also quantified 
following calibration against aqueous standard solutions. All 
measurements were carried out monitoring the isotopes 79Br and 35Cl. 

For comparison, Br and Cl were also determined by HR-CS GF 
MAS. For Br determination a Ca2+ solution was pipetted directly into 
the graphite tube as the molecule-forming reagent. The coal samples (?
0.2–3 mg) were directly weighed onto the SS platform previously 
treated with a total of 400 ?g Zr (10 injections of 40 ?L containing 40 
?g Zr each) (i.e., which had not to be renewed throughout the lifetime of 
the platform) and introduced into the GF to be submitted to the 
temperature program [91]. 

 Chlorine was determined using Sr2+ as the molecule-forming 
reagent. Coal CRM were directly weighed (? 0.05 to 0.5 mg) onto the 
SS platform, also previously treated with a total of 400 µg of zirconium 
as a permanent chemical modifier. Afterwards, 10 µL (2% m/v) of the 
molecule-forming Sr solution (as SrCO3) has been injected over the coal

samples on the SS platform and introduced into the GF to be submitted 
to the temperature program [92].  

3.3. Results and discussion 

3.3.1. Optimization of ICP-MS operating parameters 

RF power and carrier gas flow-rate were optimized aiming at 
maximum sensitivity for the analytes. The results are shown in Figures 
13a and 13b. The RF power was evaluated (Figure 13a) and maximum 
signal was obtained at 900 W for Br and at 1200 W for Cl, using the 
BCR-182 coal CRM. This difference is related to the ionization potential 
of each element; Br an Cl have ionization potentials of 11.81 eV and 
12.97 eV, respectively, which means that Cl requires more energy to be 
ionized. Since the sensitivity associated to Cl determination is lower 
than for Br, the RF power was chosen to be 1200 W. 

Figure 13. Effect of carrier gas flow-rate (A) and RF power (B) on the 
analytical signal obtained by SS-ETV-ICP-MS for Br and Cl in BCR-
182 coal CRM and in aqueous standard solutions. Pyrolysis and 
vaporization temperatures were set at 400 °C and 2000 oC, respectively. 
Normalized signals refer to the ratio between the individual signal and 
the highest signal in the series. 

The carrier gas flow-rate influences the sensitivity and the 
analytical signal profile, as already observed by Antes et al. [69] for Cl 
determination in coke samples. In our work, the carrier gas flow-rate did 
not exert significant influence on the analytical signal profile, and a 
maximum intensity was achieved with a carrier gas flow-rate of 1.1 L 
min-1 (Figure 13b).

3.3.2. Evaluation of pyrolysis and vaporization temperatures  

Pyrolysis and vaporization temperatures were evaluated in 
parallel with a study of modifiers/aerosol carriers. In addition to 
increased thermal stability, the use of modifiers was evaluated as a 
means to equalize the sensitivity for both aqueous standard solutions and 
solid samples, which would allow the subsequent determination of Br 
and Cl using calibration against aqueous standard solutions. 

Calcium and Al were chosen due to their high bonding energies 
with Br and Cl, which has led to their use as molecule forming reagents 
in halogen determination by HR-CS MAS [83].  

The use of Ca and Al as individual modifiers, however, resulted 
in distorted transient peaks, and symmetrical signals could only be 
obtained upon the concomitant use of Pd, a finding that is in agreement 
with similar studies by Resano et al. [82]. Hence, the combined Pd + Ca 
and Pd + Al modifiers were evaluated as to their ability to improve the 
thermal stability for the analytes.  

Pyrolysis and vaporization curves are shown in Figure 14 for 
aqueous standard solutions and a solid CRM. Figure 14 demonstrates 
that in the absence of modifiers, analyte losses occur already at pyrolysis 
temperatures as low as 200 °C for aqueous standards, whereas higher 
stability is observed for the solid sample, which is likely due to the 
covalent interaction of Cl and Br with matrix components. 

In general, the use of chemical modifiers provided a significant 
increase in thermal stability for both analytes in the aqueous solution, 
but there is also an improvement in stability for the solid samples. The 
use of Pd + Ca provided the best thermal stability for aqueous standards 
compared to Pd alone and Pd + Al in all cases.  

Overall, it is likely that the thermal stability provided by the 
modifiers acts together with improved transport efficiency in the 
presence of Pd + Ca or Al, which is likely to occur due to the favorable 
interaction between the halogens and Ca and Al, particularly. The 
optimum conditions chosen for each modifier are presented in Table 5

3.3.3.  Evaluation of potential interfering species 

Spectral interferences can drastically affect the accuracy of the 
measurements, particularly considering the formation of polyatomic ions 
such as 16O18O1H+ and 34S1H+, which overlap with 35Cl+; 36Ar1H+ and 
36S1H+ which overlap  with 37Cl+; 40Ar39K+, 31P16O3

+ and 38Ar40Ar1H+, 
which overlap with 79Br+ and finally 32S16O3

1H+, 40Ar40Ar1H+ and 
33S16O3

+,which overlap with 81Br+. Since coal usually contains 
substantial amounts of S and K, an interference evaluation was 
necessary to assure the correctness of the quantification.

temperature possible (100 oC), in order to avoid volatilization during this 
step.

respective m/z of K, S and P were pronounced, as shown by the green

line, baseline values were obtained for Cl and Br in their respective m/z, 
which leads to the assumption that no interference due to polyatomic ion 
formation takes place under the conditions adopted. This should be even 
less significant considering that a higher pyrolysis temperature was 
chosen for the quantification, with further reduction in the population of 
concomitant species in the ICP [40]. 

3.3.4. Figures of merit and analytical application 
  

Although calibration against aqueous standard solutions is 
regarded as the simplest procedure available for quantification, the 
behavior of the analyte in aqueous standard solutions must be similar to 
its behavior in the samples, generating similar responses.  

This is particularly critical in SS-ETV-ICP-MS, since the 
influence of the matrix on analyte vaporization is amplified and the 
transport efficiency from the ETV to the ICP must be considered. 
Hence, calibration against aqueous standard solutions is frequently ruled 
out as a feasible approach in analytical procedures that involve direct 
sampling analysis and ETV-ICP-MS [40].

In order to establish a comparison, calibration against aqueous 
standard solutions and using solid CRM were carried out with and 
without the combined modifiers described in the previous section. 
Calibration against a solid CRM was carried out using a sample mass 
ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 mg of BCR-182 coal, whereas calibration

against aqueous standard solutions was performed within the range of 
0.02 - 0.10 µg Br and 0.1 - 5.0 µg Cl, with and without the use of 
modifiers and under the optimized pyrolysis and vaporization 
temperatures presented in Table 6. 

Table 6 shows the slope and linear correlation coefficient 
obtained for each calibration approach for both analytes. As shown, 
none of the modifiers was able to provide a similar sensitivity for 
calibration against aqueous and solid standards for Cl, which implies 
that a solid reference material has to be used for calibration.  

The sensitivity deriving from calibration using BCR-182 was 
significantly lower than the one obtained for Cl using aqueous standard 
solutions, which suggests that either the transport efficiency is improved 
in the latter case or analyte vaporization from the solid matrix is 
hindered by a strong interaction with matrix components. This situation 
contrasts with the one observed for Br, since for this element the use of 
Pd + Ca or Pd + Al provided similar sensitivity for both calibration 
approaches, suggesting that good accuracy could be obtained with 
calibration against aqueous standard solutions. 

Although both Pd + Ca and Pd + Al provided similar sensitivity 
for calibration against aqueous standard solutions and using a solid 
CRM for Br determination, the determination of Br and Cl was carried 
using Pd + Ca due to the higher thermal stability provided by this 
combination of modifiers, as can be seen in the pyrolysis and 
vaporization curves shown in Figure 14. 

The sensitivity was also improved with the adoption of Pd + Ca, 
particularly for Cl. Overall, it can be assumed that the chemical 
interaction between Br and Ca or Al was effective particularly using a 
solid sample, since the sensitivity improved as a result of higher 
transport efficiency and thermal stability. The same effect was noticed 
for Cl, although the interaction of the analyte with the co-modifier (Ca 
or Al) was not sufficient to equalize the sensitivity for aqueous standard 
solutions and solid reference material.  

The LOQ was calculated as 10 times the standard deviation of 
ten measurements of the empty cup divided by the slope of the 
calibration curve, adjusted to the sample mass used for analysis. The 
LOQs obtained were 0.03 µg g-1 for Br and 7 µg g-1 for Cl. This is the 
first time that detection limit for Br is reported using SS-ETV-ICP-MS; 
a comparison with the LOQ of 5 ?g g-1 obtained using SS-HR GF MAS 
[18] shows an improvement of about two orders of magnitude for SS-
ETV-ICP-MS, using approximately the same sample mass. 



Chapter 3

?

Regarding Cl, Antes et al. obtained a similar LOQ for 
petroleum coke using SS-ETV-ICP-MS (3.5 µg g-1), although using 
sample mass aliquots of about 5 mg, i.e. ten times higher than the typical 
sample mass required in the current work [69]. Determination of 
halogens using laser ablation and ICP-MS provide typically higher 
LOQ, such as 6 µg g-1 for Br and 27 µg g-1 for Cl in geological and 
environmental samples, as described by Boulyga and Heumann [64]. 

Chlorine was determined in five coal CRM using calibration 
against BCR-181. The results, shown in Table 7, are in agreement with 
the certified values and with the comparison technique, demonstrating 
the accuracy of the methodology.

In this sense, if the purpose is to carry out simultaneous 
determination of Br and Cl, calibration using solid standards is 
mandatory in order to provide good accuracy for both analytes. 
Nonetheless, individual determination of Br may be carried out using 
aqueous standard solutions for calibration.  

The method proposed is efficient and fast, taking about 4 min 
for each analysis and providing RSDs of about 10% (with exception of 
Br in NIST 1630a for which an RSD of 16% was obtained), which is 
good since the heterogeneity of the sample must be considered when 
small amounts of sample are measured. 

3.4. Conclusions

Due to the importance of the determination of Br and Cl in coal 
and aiming at solving the problems related to sample pretreatment for Br 
and Cl determination, the use of SS-ETV-ICP-MS was proven efficient 
to determine simultaneously both analytes without any advanced sample 
pretreatment protocol. 

 The use of chemical modifiers is recommended in order to 
provide higher thermal stability, hence avoiding losses during the 
pyrolysis step. A combination of permanently deposited Pd and pre-
dried Ca enabled the determination of Br using aqueous standard 
solutions for calibration, although simultaneous determination of Br and 
Cl must be carried out using solid CRM for calibration. LOQ values 
lower than those found in the literature were achieved for both analytes 
and the procedure was proven accurate by the analysis of five CRM.

4.1. Introduction 

Halogens and halogenated compounds differ significantly in 
reactivity, physical properties and toxicity. Although some halogens, 
such as Cl and I, are regarded as essential elements to several forms of 
life, it is generally agreed that the presence of halogens in the 
environment is associated to hazards which include their ability to react 
with O3 molecules and the potential to interfere in the balance of 
atmospheric SOx and NOx [14, 93,94]. 

The majority of the atmospheric halogen content comes from 
marine aerosols, although the emission of halogens from volcanic 
eruptions also plays an important role on the dynamics of the halogens 
in the Earth environment [95-96]. 

Other sources of halogens include the release of I2 and CH3Br 
from algae and land plants and anthropogenic processes [97], such as the 
combustion of fossil fuels and the manufacturing of polyfluorinated 
compounds [98], lubricants, varnishes and pesticides [99-100].  

Particulate matter (PM) is normally composed by suspended 
liquids and solid particles floating in the air which are released in the 
atmosphere from specific sources or formed by reactions in the 
atmosphere. The determination of halogens in PM 10 (droplets from 2.5 
to 10 µm in diameter), known as inhalable coarse particle, is an 
important task due to the high risk to the public health as they can be 
inhaled and reach the lungs. Moreover this type of analysis can bring 
important information about pollution [101].  

Given the hazardous nature of halogens in the environment and 
several mechanisms that lead to their release into the atmosphere, the 
determination of halogens in the air is an important - and complex - 
analytical task. For this purpose, several techniques have been 
historically used, and more recently and far less frequently, HR-CS 
MAS and ICP-MS have been described for this task [91]. 

The association between direct solid sampling analysis and the 
above-mentioned spectrometric techniques has been proven effective for 
trace element determination in a number of applications, which may be 
particularly useful in the case of the PM10 analysis, since the presence of 
relatively high levels of silicates and oxides turn acid-based digestion 
into complex routines [102]. In addition, the halogens are prone to react 
readily under acidic conditions and at high temperatures to form their 
respective hydrogen halides, which are volatile and may be lost during 
the digestion procedure.  



Chapter 4

The use of line source atomic absorption spectrometry is not 
suitable for fluorine determination due to the fact that its main resonance 
lines are located below 95 nm, which cannot be achieved.  

Recently, the feasibility of adapting a HR-CS atomic absorption 
spectrometer to carry out analysis based on diatomic molecule formation 
(which can absorb over a wider spectral range) inside the GF has been 
demonstrated for F determination by monitoring molecules such as SrF 
[103], BaF [104], GaF [105], AlF and MgF [106].  

More recently, Morés et al. [107] demonstrated the feasibility of 
determining F by monitoring the CaF molecule at 606.440 nm region, 
which is advantageous because of the reduced risk of spectral 
interferences in this spectral range and the strong absorption intensity of 
the molecule at this line. This was a major breakthrough for AAS, since 
F cannot be directly determined using ICP-MS, due to the high 
ionization potential of this element, which hinders the formation of 
positive and singly ionized ions under the typical operating conditions of 
the instrument.  

Given the widespread distribution of halogens in the 
environment and the importance and challenges associated with their 
determination, the aim of this work was to assess the application of 
direct solid sample analysis for the determination of F using HR-CS GF 
MAS and Br, Cl and I using ETV-ICP-MS in PM10, a procedure which 
was applied to the analysis of PM10 from the city of Aracaju, located in 
the Northeast of Brazil. 

4.2. Experimental 

4.2.1. Instrumentation 

 Fluorine determination was carried out using a high-resolution 
continuum source atomic absorption spectrometer model ContrAA 700 
(Analytik Jena AG, Jena, Germany) with a transversely heated graphite 
tube atomizer. The ContrAA 700 is equipped with a high-intensity 
xenon short-arc lamp operating in “hot-spot” mode, a high resolution 
monochromator consisting of a pre-dispersing prism and an echelle 
grating monochromator, and a linear array charge coupled device 
detector (CCD) with 200 analytically accessible pixels. 

Direct insertion of the solid samples was accomplished by 
means of the SSA 600 automatic solid sampling device (Analytik Jena 



Chapter 4 

63 

?

AG). The SSA 600 is composed of a set of tweezers, which transport the 
pyrolytically-coated SS-platforms into the GF.  

Solid samples were directly transferred to the SS-platforms 
using a stainless steel micro spatula. Aqueous standards and reagents 
were injected manually onto the SS-platform using micropipettes with 
disposable tips. The CaF diatomic molecule spectrum was used to 
determine F in the PM10 samples. The molecular band head at 606.432 
nm was monitored using only one pixel due to the high intensity of this 
line; the use of less intense lines using more pixels resulted in poor 
precision compared to this line.  

Chlorine, Br and I were determined using an Elan 6000 
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer equipped with an HGA-
600 MS ETV device from Perkin-Elmer (Thornhill, Canada). The ‘cup-
in-tube’ technique described by Vollkopf et al [75]. was used for the 
solid sampling experiments. 

The samples were directly weighed using a solid sampling glass 
capillary and a micro-balance model M2P (Sartorius, Göttingen, 
Germany) and transferred to pyrolytically-coated graphite cups from 
Perkin-Elmer (Norwalk, CT, USA). The operating parameters of the 
ICP-MS instrument are listed in Table 9. Argon with a purity of 
99.996% (White Martins São Paulo, Brazil) was used as plasma and 
carrier gas and as the protective and purge gas of the ETV.

4.2.2. Reagents, Standards and Samples 

 All reagents used were at least analytical grade. Deionized 
water was obtained from a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, 
USA) at a resistivity of 18.2 M? cm. Individual stock standard solutions 
containing each 1000 mg L-1 Ca (Ca(NO3)2), Cl (KCl), Br (KBr) and I 
(KI) were obtained from Quimilab (São Paulo, SP, Brazil), Pd 
(Pd(NO3)2) from Sigma-Aldrich (Missouri, USA) and F (NaF) from 
Spex (New Jersey, NJ, USA).  

Two CRMs, NIST 1648 and NIST 1648a Urban Particulate 
Matter, from NIST (Gaithersburg, USA), were used. 

4.2.3. Sampling of Airborne Inhalable Particulate Matter 

 The PM10 samples were collected following the directives of 
the Brazilian Technical Standards Association (NBR 9547). The 
collection was carried out using a high volume sampler which was 
installed in Aracaju, Sergipe, Brazil in a territory administrated by 
Sergipe’s Environment and Water Resources Department  (Secretaria de 
Estado do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Hídricos, Aracaju, SE, Brasil). 
The sampling location is adjacent to residential and industrial areas, next 
to a region with a relatively intense traffic of motorized vehicles. 

Sample collection was carried out using glass fiber filters for 
PM10. Prior to use, the glass fiber filters (Energética, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 
Brazil) were maintained on a desiccator for 24 h. Collection of PM10
samples was carried out using an air flow of 1677 m3 for 24 hours. At 
the end of the sampling procedure, the samples were placed into a 
desiccator for 24 h before weighing. Sample collection was carried out 
during dry and rainy seasons in the period ranging from February 06, 
2013 to June 09, 2013.  

4.2.4. Analytical procedure 

The samples were grinded prior analysis. Fluorine 
determination by SS-HR-CS GF MAS was carried out by monitoring the 
CaF molecular absorption band at 606.432 nm, which provided adequate 
sensitivity for the purpose of this work. The absorption spectrum of the 
CaF molecule is shown in Figure 16 for the real PM10 sample from 
02/April/2013.

diatomic molecule obtained from a PM10 sample in the 606.15 ± 0.45 
nm spectral region. Absorbance is normalized to the highest absorbance 
observed in this spectral window. 

Pyrolysis and atomization temperatures were optimized using 
one of the PM10 samples and the mass of molecule-forming agent (Ca) 
was optimized using one of the PM10 samples and a standard solution 
containing F. The PM10 samples (or standard solution) were directly 
weighed (? 0.2 - 1 mg) onto the SS platform, previously treated with a 
total of 400 µg thermally deposited Pd to act as a permanent chemical 
modifier [108]. Subsequently, 10 µL of the molecule-forming Ca 
solution at 1.0 g L-1 were placed with a micropipette on top of the PM10
samples on the SS platform and introduced into the GF, followed by 
application of the temperature program of the instrument. 

Chlorine, Br and I determination were carried out using SS-
ETV ICP-MS. Pyrolysis and vaporization temperatures of the ETV, the 
carrier gas flow rate and RF power of the ICP-MS instrument were 
optimized. The modifiers studied were Pd and the mixture of Pd + Ca. In 
these cases, 200 ?g Pd was deposited onto the internal surface of the 
sampling cups (10 injections of 20 ?L of a 1.0 g L-1 Pd solution), 
whereas Ca was pre-dried using 20 ?L of a 1.0 g L-1 Ca solution [9, 
105]. The temperature programs of the GF and ETV are presented in 
Table 10.

The PM10 sample from 02/April/2013, collected in the city of 
Aracaju, was used during all optimization steps, whereas NIST 1648 
CRM was used for calibration.  

Meteorological data were obtained from the Brazilian Weather 
Database for Teaching and Research (Banco de Dados Meterológicos 
para Ensino e Pesquisa) [109]. Statistical analysis was performed using 
STATISTICA v.6.0 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). All measurements 
were carried out at least in triplicate.

4.3. Results and discussion

4.3.1. Optimization of ICP-MS Operating Parameters  

In addition to the GF temperature program, the RF power and 
nebulizer gas flow rate may exert significant influence on sensitivity and 
signal stability for ETV-ICP-MS analysis. 

RF power and carrier gas flow rate of the ICP-MS were 
optimized and the results showed that the highest sensitivity was 
achieved upon adoption of an RF power of 1300 W for Cl, 1100 W for 
Br and 1000 W for I. These differences are likely to be related to the 
high ionization potential of the elements, which increase in the order Cl 
&gt; Br  &gt; I. Since the most critical element regarding sensitivity is Cl due 



Chapter 4 

67 

?

to its high ionization potential (12.97 eV), the selected RF power was 
1300 W.  

Similarly, the carrier gas flow rate represents a critical factor for 
halogen determination by ICP-MS, and aspects such as signal profile 
and sensitivity are affected by this parameter [28].  

The results demonstrated that although the adoption of carrier 
gas flow rates between 0.5 L min-1 and 0.6 L min-1 resulted in higher 
sensitivity, especially for Cl, the RSD were remarkably higher under 
these conditions, which may be partially attributed to the reduced 
transfer rate of the analyte containing-vapor through the transfer hose, 
resulting in condensation losses especially for Cl.  

On the other hand, the adoption of carrier gas flow rates higher 
than 0.7 L min-1 resulted in reduced sensitivity, which is believed to be 
due to the reduced residence time of the analytes in the ICP. Considering 
these aspects, the carrier gas flow rate was set at 0.7 L min-1. 

4.3.2. Fluorine measurements using HR-CS-GF MAS 

The molecule forming agent (Ca) must be added favorably in 
order to promote the formation of CaF, ideally without any measurable 
residue of F on the platform at the end of each analytical cycle. The 
required mass of Ca to be added to F-containing samples was evaluated 
using 100 ng of F in the form of an aqueous standard. Calcium was 
added as an aqueous solution, prepared from Ca(NO3)2.   

The effect of increasing Ca mass on the measurable signal 
obtained from the formation of CaF is shown in Figure 17. From this 
figure, it is clear that at least 6 µg of Ca are required to achieve 
maximum sensitivity for CaF produced from an aqueous fluorine 
solution. 

The situation is less critical for the solid PM10, since the natural 
concentration of Ca in these samples was typically sufficient to produce 
high populations of the CaF molecule even without addition of Ca as an 
aqueous solution. Nonetheless, in order to assure sufficient excess of Ca 
in all cases, 10 µg Ca (10 µL of a Ca solution at 1.0 g L-1) was added to 
all samples to assure uniform molecule formation regardless of the 
native Ca content of the samples.

molecule by SS-HR-CS GF MAS at 606.4322 nm using 100 ng of F as 
aqueous solution. Pyrolysis and vaporization temperatures were set at 
1100 °C and 2200 oC, respectively. Signal was normalized dividing the 
measurements value by the highest measurement value obtained. 

4.3.3. Temperature program optimization 

The temperature program should be optimized in order to 
promote efficient vaporization of the analyte during the vaporization 
step, and ideally most of the matrix should be removed without analyte 
loss during the pyrolysis step. 

 The pyrolysis (Tp) and vaporization temperatures (Tv) for F (as 
CaF) using SS-HR-CS GF MAS (Figure 18a) and for Cl, Br and I using 
SS-ETV-ICP-MS (Figures 18b-18d) were optimized using a ‘real’ PM10
sample (Sample 02/April/2013).  

For F, it is shown in Figure 18a that a Tp of 1200 oC could be 
used without analyte loss, which is significantly higher than the 
previously reported values for the CaF molecule [107]. This additional 
stability may be attributed to the use of thermally deposited Pd onto the 
platform surface as a permanent modifier. A pyrolysis temperature of 
1100 oC was chosen for subsequent studies in order not to reduce the 
lifetime of the graphite tube and SS platform.  

The vaporization temperature curve, which is also shown in 
Figure 18a, demonstrates that diffusional losses and/or molecule 
dissociation occur to a significant extent at temperatures higher than 
2200 °C, which was then selected for subsequent experiments.  



Chapter 4

?

Pyrolysis and vaporization temperature curves obtained using 
SS-ETV-ICP-MS for Cl, Br and I were also evaluated and are shown in 
Figures 18b-18d. Chemical modifiers, which may also act as aerosol 
carriers, were evaluated.  

The use of chemical modifiers in the form of acidic solutions 
was proven to promote analyte losses during the pyrolysis step, which is 
likely due to the formation of volatile hydrogen halides. Hence, as a 
means to remove the acid from the solution, the chemical modifier 
solutions were pipetted into the graphite tube and submitted to a drying 
step prior to insertion of the samples.

SS-HR-CS GF MAS and (B) Cl, (C) Br, and  (D) I using SS-ETV-ICP-

1300 W RF power; 0.7 L min-1 carrier gas flow rate. Normalized signals 
refer to the ratio between each individual signal and the highest signal in 
the series. All data were obtained using the 02/April/2013 PM10 sample. 
Palladium was used as permanent chemical modifier for both techniques
and Ca in solution form was used as molecule-forming agent for SS-HR-
CS GF MAS and modifier/aerosol carrier for SS-ETV-ICP-MS. 



Chapter 4

?

Under these conditions, thermal stability was achieved for all 
elements up to a pyrolysis temperature of 500 oC, and even in the 
absence of chemical modifiers a similar thermal stability was observed – 
an effect that may be related to the presence of Ca in the samples, which 
may itself act as stabilizing agent. Adoption of a Tp of 500 °C allowed 
the analysis to be carried out without deposition of solid residues on the 
sampling cone, which suggests efficient matrix elimination.  

Optimum vaporization temperatures ranged from 1600 oC for 
Br to 2300 oC for I, both without the use of chemical modifiers. As a 
compromise condition, the Tv was maintained at 2100 oC. Despite the 
apparent usefulness of a modifier-free determination, the concomitant 
addition of Pd + Ca was considered necessary in order to decrease the 
interaction of the analytes with the graphite surface [108], and also as a 
means to reduce the potential influence of Ca concentration on the 
sensitivity achieved for the analytes vaporized from different samples.  

4.3.4. Quantification and analytical figures of merit 

One of the challenges of direct solid sample analysis concerns 
the calibration procedure, since identical analyte behavior in calibration 
standards and in the solid matrix are, on occasions, hardly achieved. 
Strategies that include the adoption of specific operating conditions of 
the instrument and the use of chemical modifiers or aerosol carriers are 
frequently useful in equalizing the behavior of the analyte in standards 
and samples [82].  

In order to assure maximum similarity between the samples and 
the calibration standards, the calibration curves were obtained using the 
NIST 1648 CRM for the determination of Br, Cl and I by SS-ETV ICP-
MS. Since there are no APM reference materials with a certified 
concentration for F, this element was determined by standard addition 
using SS-HR-CS GF MAS.  

In order to check the accuracy of the measurements, the 
certified reference sample NIST 1648a was analyzed for Br, Cl and I. In 
addition, three ‘real’ PM10 samples were also analyzed using standard 
addition calibration, in order to further asses the accuracy of the 
procedure. The results are shown in Table 11. 

Due to the high amount of S (5%), K (~1%) and P (~1%) in the 
certified reference sample NIST 1648, spectral interferences, which are 
related to the formation of 34S1H+, which overlaps with 35Cl+, and 
40Ar39K+ and 31P16O3

+ , which overlap with 79Br+, could occur. However, 



Chapter 4

?

as can be seen from the results in Table 11, these interferences do not 
present a problem with this analytical method.  

In the previous studies, it was shown that these interferences are 
rarely a concern, since the above-mentioned polyatomic ions are not 
formed quantitatively or are not detected upon vaporization S, K and P 
using ETV-ICP-MS. Since the determined values were in good 
statistical agreement (95% confidence level) with the certified values for 
the analytes in NIST 1648, it is assumed that the procedure is free of 
interferences.  

Since no CRM for F was available, the determination of the 
referred element was carried out by standard addition in order to check 
for the presence of matrix effects. Although standard addition 
calibration using solid samples and aqueous standards may sound as a 
somewhat odd approach, the results were useful to demonstrate that the 
added analyte behaves very similarly to the ‘native’ analyte present in 
the solid samples, which validates the approach. 

The precision was determined as the RSD of three replicate 
measurements of NIST 1648a CRM. The RSD values ranged between 
0.8% (F) and 12.9% (Cl).   

The limits of detection were calculated as the ratio between 
three times the standard deviation of ten blank measurements and the 
slope of the calibration curves, adjusted to the typical sample masses 
that were inserted in the graphite tube. The calculated values were 0.3 
µg g-1 (0.4 ng m3) for F by SS-HR-CS GF MAS, and 0.02 mg g-1 (30 ng 
m3) for Cl, 0.1 µg g-1 (0.1 ng m3) for Br and 2 ng g-1 (0.003 ng m3) for I 
by SS-ETV-ICP-MS, which are suitable for the analysis of PM10
samples.

4.3.5. Analysis of PM10 samples 

The halogen content of 14 PM10 samples collected during 
different periods in the city of Aracaju was assessed using the newly 
developed methods. Each filter was loaded with PM10 masses ranging 
from 29 mg to 59.3 mg, which corresponds with 17 ?g to 36 ?g PM10
per cubic meter of air. The results are shown in Table 12.  

As can be seen, the concentration values ranged from 793.4 to 
2642.7 ng m-3 for F, 647 to 7573 ng m-3 for Cl, 1.4 to 17.6 ng m-3 for Br 
and from 1.167 to 4.285 ng m-3 for I. The most significant variation in 
concentration levels was detected for Cl, which may be related to the 
fact that the samples originate from a coastal region. As expected, Br 
was the least abundant element in the analyzed samples.  

Precision, reported as RSD, ranged between 0.8 and 9.2% for F, 
0.6 and 12.9% for Cl, 0.6 and 12.4% for Br and 0.02 and 9.2% for I, 
referring to triplicate measurements of the PM10 samples. These values 
reflect an adequate sample homogeneity, which was aided by the 
grinding process of the glass fiber filters containing PM10.

Overall, the increase trend in F concentration levels were found 
to be opposite to that of the other halogens, whereas variations in Br, Cl 
and I concentrations showed a similar trend. The similarity regarding 
variations in the concentrations of Cl, Br and I was already described
[110] and it has been suggested that this behavior is related to the fact 
that these elements originate mainly from the sea, even though a fraction 
of the Br and I content has also been shown to derive from soil 
emissions, microbial activity and biomass combustion [111].  

Figure 19. Effect of relative air humidity on the determined 
concentrations of F (obtained by SS-HR-CS GF MAS), Br, Cl and I 
(obtained by SS-ETV-ICP-MS) in airborne inhalable particulate matter 
(PM10) samples. The PM10 samples were collected in the coastal city of 
Aracaju, Sergipe, Brazil, between February and June, 2013.  

The concentrations of Cl, Br and I were directly related to the 
relative air humidity at the time of collection, in the sense that these 
elements were more abundant in PM10 samples collected at higher 
humidity conditions. The opposite behavior was observed for F, which 



Chapter 4 

76?

?

was determined to be at higher concentrations in samples collected 
during reduced air humidity conditions (Figure 19). These results 
suggest that, in fact, the atmospheric Cl, Br and I content originate from 
sources that differ from those responsible for the presence of F. 

The Br/I concentration ratios varied from 1.0 to 6.4, with an 
average value of 3.7 ± 1.6. These values are comparable to those 
observed in Hawaii (approximately 3.5) and in the western pacific ocean 
(approximately 6.4), which is yet another evidence to the fact that these 
elements originate from marine sources [112].  

Fluorine concentrations were also related to the sunlight 
incidence (Figure 20). Since the main source of F emission is not fully 
clear, it can be assumed that vaporization of F-containing compounds 
from urban dust is more efficient at higher irradiation periods, hence 
increasing the absolute F concentration in PM10 samples collected after 
longer sunlight exposure. 

It should be emphasized that the PM10 collection site is 
surrounded by roads with a relatively intense circulation of motorized 
vehicles, a few industries and a large residential area, which are 
regarded as potential emission sources of inhalable particles to the 
atmosphere. Another important factor to be considered is the high 
reactivity of F with fiberglass, therefore it's concentrations may also to F 
in vapor form not only to MP10. 

Figure 20. Effect of sunlight irradiation (insolation) on the determined 
concentration of F obtained by SS-HR-CS GF MAS in airborne

Principal component (PC) analysis of the data related to the 
halogen concentrations in the PM10 samples was carried out in order to 
investigate statistically the correlation between the halogen content and 
the weather conditions at the time of sample collection. The score plot of 
PC1 versus PC2 considering the concentrations of F, Cl, Br and I 
(Figure 21) resulted in the identification of two distinct groups of 
samples, which are related to the accumulated rainfall during the 
collection period.  

The accumulated rainfall during the months of March and April 
reached values of 7.8 mm and 10.8 mm, respectively, whereas in May 
and June these values were raised to 195.8 mm and 115.4 mm, 
respectively.

PM10 samples. Square on the right side (red) represents samples from 
rainy periods while the square on the left side (blue) represents the 
samples from periods without rain. 

The sample collected in March 06, 2013 was grouped together 
with the samples collected during the rainy months, which results from 
an abnormally high rainfall that occurred the day before the collection. 
Despite the sample collected in February 06, 2013 has been collected 
during the dry season it is not grouped together in this group, one

possible explanation is based on the relative humidity of the previous 
days, February 04 and 05 of 2013 (76% and 72 %, respectively), which 
were higher than the dry days (69% in average) and lower than the rainy 
days (79% in average) resulting in a different trend for this sample.  

In PC1 axis, the right side group shows that the concentrations 
of Cl, Br and I are predominant parameters. In the left side group, F 
concentration is the predominant parameters. The concentrations of Cl, 
Br and I have been directly related to higher humidity conditions, 
whereas an opposite behavior was observed for F. 

4.4. Conclusions 

Direct solid sample analysis using HR-CS-GF MAS for F 
determination and ETV-ICP-MS for Cl, Br and I determination in PM10 
samples have proven to be efficient and fast approaches and interesting 
alternatives to avoid the problems related to halogen determination and 
sample preparation. Monitoring of an analytical line in the visible region 
for F determination via absorption of the CaF molecule provided 
accurate results with high sensitivity. 

 The simultaneous determination of Cl, Br and I using SS-ETV-
ICP-MS was demonstrated for the first time and it was proven feasible, 
accurate and sensitive for halogen determination in airborne inhalable 
particulate matter. Application of both methods to a set of PM10 samples 
collected in a Northeastern coastal city in Brazil revealed that the 
presence of halogens correlates well to weather conditions, particularly 
to accumulated rainfall and relative air humidity. Higher relative air 
humidity resulted in higher concentrations of Cl, Br and I, which are 
usually originated from marine sources, whereas the F is more 
abundantly present in periods with higher sunlight incidence.

5.1. Introduction 

Plastic materials are widely used in our daily life, requiring 
different properties for different applications, such as treatment with 
flame retardants. One technique to achieve flame retardance in polymers 
is based on scavenging of radicals formed during combustion, which is 
normally achieved by adding halogenated compounds to the polymer as 
an additive [113 - 116]. 

Brominated compounds are preferred over other halogens, 
which is due to the fact that F presents high electronegativity, generating 
thermally stable compounds, Cl compounds are not easily degraded in 
nature and I is large enough to be easily dissociated from the compound 
it is bounded to. On the other hand, Br compounds are more 
biodegradable in nature than Cl compounds. Bromine also dissociates 
readily from organic molecules at high temperatures, forming a radical 
that acts as scavenger [117]. 

Although there are advantages associated to the use of Br 
compounds as flame retardants, its presence in the environment is 
considered hazardous and its inhalation may produce irritation and tissue 
damage, in addition to other environmental effects such as the depletion 
of the ozone layer [23, 116-118]. 

In this sense, monitoring of Br concentration in products that 
may release the element to the atmosphere is considered important and 
the use of ICP-MS is an attractive technique for this task due to the high 
sensitivity and wide linear calibration range [5]. However, a 
conventional analysis by ICP-MS normally requires sample 
pretreatment, which is time consuming, requires additional equipments 
and promotes dilution of the sample, which leads to increased limit of 
detection (LOD) and the possibility of contamination.  

Halogen determination in polymers requires even more 
complex sample preparation setups, since extreme conditions of 
temperature and pressure are required for the destruction of the sample 
matrix without promoting analyte loss or contamination [114].  

In this sense, direct analysis brings the advantages of decreasing 
the possibility of analyte loss and contamination.   

Direct solid sample analysis (SS) by means of laser ablation 
(LA) or ETV, has shown to be an efficient strategy for Br determination 
by ICP-MS in different matrices. However, some drawbacks are still 
present, such as difficulties associated to calibration and low precision 
of the results due to non-homogenous distribution of the analyte in the 



Chapter 5

?

samples. Nonetheless, ID calibration has been successfully applied for 
Br quantification by LA-ICP-MS, whereas external calibration using 
aqueous and solid standards may be successfully used in SS-ETV-ICP-
MS for different matrices [69, 40, 64]. 

Thus, the aim of this chapter is to evaluate the capability of 
direct solid sampling analysis by LA-ICP-MS for Br analysis in 
polymeric samples, exploring simple and straightforward techniques for 
calibration. 

5.2. Experimental

The LA-ICP-MS experiments were carried out using a GeoLas 
ArF excimer-based LA system (MicroLas, Germany), coupled to an 
Element XR single-collector sector field instrument (Thermo Scientific, 
Germany).

undergoes homogenization, enabling flat-bottomed and straight-walled 
craters to be obtained. The ablation cell was coupled to the ICP-MS 
torch via a 3-mm-internal-diameter Tygon tubing using Ar-He as the 
carrier [119]. Helium was driven through the ablation cell to carry the 
analytes and Ar was added to the gas stream leaving the cell using 
Teflon connection. The operating parameters of the LA-ICP-MS system 
are presented in Table 13. 

5.2.2. Samples, reagents and standards 

All reagents used were at least analytical grade. Deionized 
water was obtained from a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, 
USA) at a resistivity of 18.2 M? cm. Six CRMs and five ‘real’ samples 
obtained from the local markets of the city of Ghent in Belgium were 
used. The reference materials used were the polyethylene CRMs ERM-
EC680, ERM-EC681 and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) ERM-
EC591 obtained from the Institute for Reference Materials and 
Measurements (IRMM, Geel, Belgium). The polyethylene CRMs PE, 
PE-H-11A and PEL-11A were supplied by Modern Analytical 
Techniques LLC (Hillsborough, USA). Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene 
resin CRM BAM was obtained from the Federal Institute for Materials 
Research and Testing (Berlin, Germany). 

5.2.3. Analytical procedure 

The samples were placed onto a plastic platform and inserted 
into the ablation cell. The surfaces of the samples were cleaned prior to 
the analysis by pre-ablation of the top layer using the optimized 
conditions and without measuring the signal. Sample ablation was 
carried out using 300 laser pulses at a frequency of 15 Hz ranging the 
samples surface. Integrated signals were used. 

Quantifications were carried out by external calibration using 
the CRMs containing different concentrations of the analyte and also by 
external calibration using only one CRM and monitoring 12C as an 
internal standard.

5.3. Results and discussion 

5.3.1. Optimization of the LA-ICP-MS parameters 

Sensitivity is an issue for Br analysis by ICP-MS due to its high 
ionization energy. Therefore, in order to obtain the maximum sensitivity 
of the method and to enable its application for trace Br analysis, the 
operating parameters of carrier gas flow, RF power of the ICP-MS, spot 
size and pulse frequency of the laser were optimized using a ‘real’ 
polyethylene sample. 

The use of He as a carrier gas promotes the formation of smaller 
particles during the ablation of the sample when compared to Ar, 
increasing the sample transport efficiency and also the process of 
ionization in the plasma [119,120]. Thus, the He flow rate was 
optimized maintaining the Ar flow constant at 0.7 L min-1, as can be 
seen in Figure 22, the selected gas flow was 0.6 L min-1, although little 
influence on the signal intensity was associated to this parameter. As the 
Ar flow is connected after the ablation cell, this parameter does not 
affect the ablation efficiency and vapor flush from the ablation cell thus 
this parameter was not optimized.

in polyethylene using LA-ICP-MS. Conditions: 950 W RF power, spot 
size of 120 µm and 15 Hz laser pulse frequency. Normalized signal refer 
to the ratio between each individual signal and the highest signal. 



Chapter 5

?

The results in Figure 23 demonstrate that the spot size plays an 
important role in the achieved sensitivity. The maximum spot size 
evaluated, 120 µm, provided the highest sensitivity. This is according to 
expectations, since a smaller amount of sample is ablated with small 
spot sizes. Smaller spot sizes may also lead to inaccurate results due to 
variations in the signal, an effect explained by the combination of 
fluence, mass ablation rate and crater aspect ratio reaching high depth 
and affecting the ablation efficiency [120, 121]. 

Figure 23. Effect of the spot size on the integrated signal for Br in 
polyethylene using LA-ICP-MS. Conditions: 950 W RF power, He 
carrier gas flow of 0.6 L min-1 and 15 Hz laser pulse frequency. 
Normalized signal refer to the ratio between each individual signal and 
the highest signal. 

The repetition rate (Figure 24) and RF power (Figure 25) were 
optimized for maximum intensities, resulting in maximum signals at 15 
Hz and 950 W, respectively. Overlap of craters may be expected when 
using high repetition rates and large spot sizes, which may promote the 
heating and melting of plastic samples, modifying the ablation 
efficiency. However, this effect was not observed in the present work, 
since the signals were proven sufficiently stable throughout the analysis 
interval.

5.3.2. Figures of merit and application 

Calibration using solid standards in ICP-MS may be very 
challenging, mainly in the case of LA-ICP-MS where the interaction of 
the laser with the sample may change depending on matrix composition. 
This effect frequently leads to differences in the ablation efficiency of 
the sample and particle formation, resulting in different sensitivities for 
different matrices [122].  

As previously mentioned, two calibration strategies were 
evaluated in this work: 1 - External calibration using different CRMs as 
external standards and 2 - External calibration using a single CRM as 
external standard, in combination with internal standardization.  

 Figure 26 presents the calibration curve obtained using 
different CRMs as external standards. As can be seen, a linear 
correlation was obtained, despite the differences in sample composition 
associated to the CRMs. This suggests that the ablation efficiency is not 
strongly affected by the polymer composition, at least not for the 
different polymers studied in this work.

concentrations of Br using a LA-ICP-MS composed by a GeoLas ArF 
system and an Element-XR ICP-MS. RF power of 950 W, He carrier gas 
flow of 0.6 L min-1, Spot size of 120 µm and frequency of 15 Hz. 

The use of external calibration with internal standization using a 
single CRM as an external standard requires the presence of one element 
(the internal standard) with known concentration in the samples and

standards, which behaves similarly to the analyte during the ablation, 
transportation and ionization in the plasma [122]. In the case of 
polymers, it is possible to estimate the carbon concentration based on 
the polymer composition. This approach prevents additional steps for 
quantification of the internal standard, thus simplifying the method. 

Table 14 presents the results obtained using the polyethylene 
CRM PE-H-11A as an external standard and monitoring the signal of 
12C+ as an internal standard. It is possible to observe that for all samples, 
except for one, the determined Br concentrations are in agreement with 
the certified value. The exception is ERC-EC591, which is a 
polybrominated diphenyl ether sample. Estimation of the carbon content 
prior to the quantification of Br is more difficult which hinders the 
accurate quantitation of the analyte in this sample besides ablation 
efficiency may be different for this sample.

The LOQ, calculated as ten times the standard deviation of ten 
measurements of the blank divided by the slope of the calibration curve, 
was 100 µg g-1 Br. The PE sample is namely bromine-free, which allow 
its use as a matrix blank. However, ten measurements of gas blank did 
not show significant differences in signal intensity compared to the 
measurements of this sample; thus, the gas blank may be used as a 
trustworthy blank. 

Bromine was quantified in five commercial samples, 3 
polypropylene and 2 polyethylene, by LA-ICP-MS using external 
calibration using different CRMs as external standards and external

internal standard. The results are presented in Table 15, where it is 
possible to observe that, although accurate results (assuming that the 
calibration against solid polymer standards is accurate) can be obtained, 
the precision was deteriorated when 12C+ was used as an IS. This may be 
related to differences between the C and Br behavior during ablation, 
aerosol transportation and ionization in the plasma. The concentration of 
Br in the ‘real’ samples ranged from 117 µg g-1 to 225  µg g-1.

5.4. Conclusions 

The quantification of Br in polymers using techniques that 
require sample dissolution is a challenging task. Therefore, in this work 
a method has been developed whereby the solid samples can be analysed 
directly by means of LA-ICP-MS.  

The use of external calibration using different polymer 
reference materials with a variation in Br concentrations between 100 
and 2000 µg g-1, provided accurate results, regardless of the polymer 
composition. The approach whereby a single polymer reference material 
was used for external calibration, in combination with the use of the 12C+

signal as internal standard, demonstrated to provide accurate, but less 
precise results for most of the samples, with the exception of the CRM 
ERM-EC591, where a good estimation of the C content was difficult.

6.1. Introduction 

Bromine has two stable isotopes of similar abundance, 81Br 
(49.31%) and 79Br (50.69%). A common Br isotopic reference material 
is seawater, which has a fixed Br isotopic composition and is referred to 
as Standard Mean Ocean Bromide (SMOB). The isotopic composition 
of SMOB was determined by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry, 
although the most commonly used reference standard, NIST SRM 977 
NaBr salt, was characterized by TIMS [50,51].  

The atomic weight of bromine was recently re-evaluated on the 
basis of previously unknown natural isotope fractionation processes 
[123]. Bromine isotope fractionation has been reported in brines and 
saline groundwater, as well as in artificially produced materials [124].  

The potential for bromine isotope fractionation induced by 
other natural processes, such as brine rejection during polar sea ice 
formation or autocatalytic processes such as “bromine explosions”, are 
yet to be investigated [125-128]. With the aim of investigating such 
processes, this chapter presents a simple method for the isotopic analysis 
of Br in seawater using MC-ICP-MS after minimal sample pre-
treatment.  

In contrast to the metallic elements normally analyzed for their 
isotopic composition using MC-ICP-MS, Br is a relatively volatile 
(when present as Br2 or as Br

- in acidic medium) non-metal, with a high 
ionization energy [129]. Isotopic analysis of Br using MC-ICP-MS in its 
standard configuration (using PN for sample introduction) represents a 
challenge for a number of reasons. 

 The use of a nebulizer mounted onto a spray chamber for 
sample introduction in MC-ICP-MS may result in pronounced memory 
effects for Br, while the introduction of water and/or other solvents into 
the central channel of the plasma is known to increase the risk of 
spectral interference [54, 57, 130].  

In order to avoid these problems related to Br isotopic analysis 
using MC-ICP-MS in its standard configuration, alternative sample 
introduction strategies have been proposed, including the insertion of Br 
as a gas into the ICP by oxidation of Br- into the volatile Br2 species 
[54],  photochemical vapor generation of Br (as CH3Br) [131] and the 
coupling of gas chromatography to MC-ICP-MS [55], as well as the 
combination of IC and aerosol desolvation (using NaHCO3/Na2CO3
buffer in order to avoid Br-losses in the desolvator system) as an online

strategy for Br MC-ICP-MS isotopic measurements in natural waters 
[132].   

In addition to the specific problems related to Br isotopic 
analysis in MC-ICP-MS, the seawater matrix presents an additional 
challenge as a result of the high concentrations of dissolved salts. Even 
after dilution, the high salt content may lead to deposits on and damage 
to the cones, reducing the sensitivity and negatively affecting stability of 
the measurements [133,134].  

The presence of high amounts of easily ionizable elements 
(such as Na, K and Ca) gives rise to non-spectral interference, while 
additional polyatomic ions, such as 40Ar39K+ and 40Ar41K+ overlap with 
the 79Br+ and 81Br+ analyte signals, respectively, at low mass resolution 
[135].  

Also correction for mass discrimination is more complicated in 
the presence of a matrix, unless all samples and the external standard 
show exactly the same matrix composition Therefore, matrix removal 
prior to isotopic analysis using MC-ICP-MS is strongly advised to avoid 
further instrumental and analytical problems. In order to separate the 
analyte from the seawater matrix, several techniques, such as vapor 
generation and ion exchange chromatography [55,133,134,136], have 
been described in the literature. In this work, only column 
chromatography was considered.  

The aim of this work was to develop a simple and accurate 
methodology for Br isotope ratio measurements in seawater using MC-
ICP-MS, with minimal sample pretreatment.  

6.2. Experimental 

6.2.1. Instrumentation 

All isotope ratio measurements were carried out using a Thermo

6.2.2. Reagents, standards and samples  

All reagents used were of analytical grade or better. Ultrapure 
water (resistivity ?18.2 M? cm) was obtained from a Milli-Q Element 
water purification system (Millipore, France). Pro-analysis purity grade 
14 mol L-1 HNO3 (ProLabo, Belgium) was further purified by sub-
boiling distillation in PFA equipment. TraceSELECT® NH3 was 
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (USA).  

Polypropylene chromatographic columns (Eichrom, USA) filled 
with 1 mL of a cation exchange resin were used for matrix removal. 
Three cationic resins were evaluated: Dowex® 50WX8 (200-400 mesh) 
and Dowex® 50WX8 (100-200 mesh) both from Sigma-Aldrich, and 
Dowex® 50WX4 (200-400 mesh) from Alfa Aesar (USA). These resins 
differ from one another in particle size and/or degree of cross-linking.  

NaBr isotopic standard reference material NIST SRM 977 and 
Sr isotopic standard reference material NIST SRM 987 SrCO3 were 
supplied by NIST (MD, USA). Individual 1,000 mg L-1 standard 
solutions of Br, Cl, Ge, Na, Se and Rh were obtained from Inorganic 
Ventures (the Netherlands). The standard solutions for Br, Cl, Na, Rh 
were used for quantitative measurements, while Ge and Se were used as 
internal standards for internal mass bias correction [123]; their isotopic 
composition was taken from reference [137].  

Suprapur NH4Cl (Merck, Germany) was used as source of Cl 
for matrix matching. The seawater CRM IRMM BCR-403 was used as 
an in-house Br isotope ratio standard, while NIST SRM 977 was used as 
Br isotopic reference material. 

6.2.3. Analytical procedure 

In-house standards were prepared by dilution of a stock solution 
of NIST SRM 977 containing 200 mg L-1 of Br. The samples were 
prepared to final concentrations of Br between 1,000 µg L-1 and 4,000 
µg L-1 in 5 mmol L-1 of NH3.  

A chlorine matrix was simulated by addition of ultrapure NH4Cl 
to obtain final Cl concentrations ranging from 300 to 1000 mg L-1. The 
concentration of the internal standard was adjusted so as to obtain a 
minimum signal intensity of 0.5 V for the minor of the two isotopes 
monitored (86Sr ? 0.7 V, 87Sr ? 0.5 V for, 77Se ? 0.5 V, 78Se ? 1.5 V, 
72Ge ? 0.5 V and 74Ge ? 0.7V). 



Chapter 6

A number of approaches to correct for instrumental mass 
discrimination were tested. Internal correction was employed using Sr, 
Se or Ge as an internal standard with the application of Russell’s revised 
exponential law. External correction was applied using a sample-
standard bracketing approach (SSB) [138].  

For determination of the concentrations of Br and Cl using 
quadrupole-based ICP-MS, the calibration standards, blank solutions 
and samples were prepared in 5 mmol L-1 NH3 with the aim of 
decreasing memory effects for these elements. For Na determination, all 
solutions were prepared in 0.07 mol L-1 HNO3. All measurements were 
carried out using 1 µg L-1 Rh as internal standard. 

The preparation of the chromatographic columns was preceded 
by cleaning the polypropylene column with ultrapure water. 
Subsequently, the column was filled with 1 mL of resin (previously 
washed with ultrapure water to remove soluble organic compounds). 2 
mL of sample solution was loaded onto the column and the Br-fraction 
was eluted with 2 mL of ultrapure water. The 2 mL of eluent leaving the 
column during sample loading and the 2 mL of eluent leaving the 
column during Br elution were collected in the same 
polytetrafluoroethylene vessel.  

An aliquot of NH3 was added to obtain a final concentration of 
5 mmol L-1 for water evaporation on a hot plate at 90 °C until a total 
volume of about 1 mL was reached (about 5 hours of evaporation). No 
loss of bromine was observed during the evaporation process, as is 
shown in section 6.3.3. 

  
6.3. Results and discussion 

6.3.1. Preliminary studies  

The occurrence of spectral interferences is one of the main 
factors which hinder accurate isotope ratio measurements. In this work, 
pseudo-high mass resolution (resolving power = 8,000) was used to free 
the Br+ signals from spectral overlap, while maintaining a flat peak 
shoulder, enabling the high precision required for isotopic analysis to be 
preserved to the largest possible extent [135]. 

Figure 27 shows the spectral peaks for both Br isotopes after 
optimization of the instrument settings with the MC-ICP-MS instrument 
equipped with the standard interface pump and cones (Figure 27a), and 
with a jet interface pump, jet sampling cone and X-type skimmer

(Figure 27b), respectively. As the signal intensity with the jet interface 
pump and standard cones was similar to that using the standard interface 
pump (and standard cones), these results have not been shown in the 
figure. Optimization of the RF power, nebulizer gas flow rate and torch 
position were carried out aiming at higher signal intensity for Br+ and a 
lower one for the interfering ions. The settings of the focus quad and 
dispersion quad lenses were optimized daily to achieve the best plateau 
for 81Br+.

solution containing 2,000 µg L-1 of Br in high resolution mode using a 
Thermo Neptune MC-ICP-MS instrument. (A) Standard interface pump 
and cones and (B) jet interface pump, jet sampler cone and X-type 
skimmer cone. 

  
Despite the ca. 5-fold lower signal intensity obtained with the 

standard cones, a better peak shape (Br+ plateau) was obtained than 
when using a jet sampling cone and X-type skimmer. Thus, all further 
Br isotope ratio measurements were carried out using standard cones. 
Due to the low sensitivity of ICP-MS for Br, especially at high mass 
resolution, the concentration of Br may have an important influence on 
the accuracy and precision attainable. Hence, the use of standard 
solutions containing from 1,000 µg L-1 to 4,000 µg L-1 of Br were 
evaluated (Figure 28).  

The signal intensity for these standard solutions ranged from 
0.08 V (1,000 µg L-1 Br) to 0.32 V (4,000 µg L-1 Br) with a standard 
interface pump and standard cones. According to counting statistics, the 
precision was slightly worse at 1,000 µg L-1 Br, whereas for
concentrations ?2,000 µg L-1 an acceptable precision (?0.003 % RSD 
for n = 3) was obtained. In addition, after correction for instrumental 
mass discrimination, the experimentally determined isotope ratios 
measured were in agreement with the certified value.

Br is one of the elements for which pronounced memory effects 
may appear. Several wash solutions – milli-Q water, 0.07 mol L-1 HNO3
solution and 5 mmol L-1 NH3 solution – were evaluated for their 
capability to overcome this drawback and hence, to increase the sample 
throughput.  

The results (Figure 29) demonstrated that the longest washout 
time was required when using 0.07 mol L-1 HNO3 solution, while also a 
higher background signal was observed. The best behavior was observed 
when using 5 mmol L-1 NH3 solution. Considering that among ‘real’ 
samples there might be some variation in the pH value, 5 mmol L-1 of 
NH3 was added to all diluted samples prior to analysis in order to avoid 
an enhanced memory effect for Br at too low a pH value.

6.3.2. Correction for instrumental mass discrimination 

The internal standards considered for internal correction for 
instrumental mass discrimination in Br isotopic analysis using MC-ICP-
MS were Ge, Se and Sr, for which the isotope ratios 74Ge/72Ge, 78Se/77Se 
and 87Sr/86Sr were considered based on the precision obtained (Table 
17).

For some of the m/z ratios involved, spectral interference may 
still occur after cation removal from seawater due to the occurrence of 
37Cl35Cl+, 36Ar36Ar+, 40Ar32S+ and 38Ar34S+ at m/z = 72; 40Ar34S+,

38Ar38Ar1H+ at m/z = 77, 40Ar38Ar+ at m/z = 78 and 35Cl35Cl14N+ at m/z = 
84. Even though the level of interference is expected to be lower for Sr 
than for the other candidate internal standards, the results using Sr as an 
internal standard were accompanied with higher RSDs than the results 
obtained relying on another internal standard (Figure 30).

for a solution containing 2,000 µg L-1 of Br without and with 1,000 mg 
L-1 of Cl at high mass resolution using a Thermo Neptune MC-ICP-MS 
instrument (n = 3, mean ± SD). 

This can be attributed to the use of NH3 as washing solution, 
which rapidly washes out Br, but causes an extended memory effect for 
all internal standards tested, most pronounced for Sr. The time required 
for stabilization of the internal standard signals was also longer in NH3
medium than in ultrapure water and HNO3 medium (given this 
limitation, it was decided to rely on external correction for mass 
discrimination only). There is no significant deterioration in the 
precision and accuracy when using external correction in a standard-
sample bracketing approach only. 

6.3.3. Evaluation of resins 

In order to avoid the adverse effects arising from the direct 
analysis of seawater to the largest possible extent, IC was relied on to 
remove the bulk of the alkali and earth alkali cations prior to Br isotopic 
analysis. As shown in Table 18, three variants of a cation exchange 
resin, differing from one another in particle size and/or degree of cross-
linking, were evaluated. Quantitative recovery of Br was easily achieved

Although quantitative recovery and absence of fractionation 
was guaranteed given the nature of the approach, the use of 
Dowex® 50WX8 (100-200 mesh) resulted in a lower precision. 
Although we have currently no indication as to the reason for the 
differences in precision observed, Dowex® 50WX8 (200-400 mesh) 
was selected for further experiments. 

The saturation point of the resin was evaluated by monitoring 
the breakthrough of Na from 500 µL to 3 mL of IRMM BCR 403 
seawater samples loaded onto a column filled with 1 mL of 
Dowex® 50WX8 (200-400 mesh). The maximum tolerable sample 
volume was determined to be 2 mL. 

The Br concentration in seawater is expected to be higher than 
4,000 µg L-1 [139]. 2 mL of seawater sample was loaded onto the 
column and a total of 4 mL column eluent was collected. The resulting 
2-fold dilution did not negatively affect the precision attainable, but to 
extend the application range to samples with a lower Br concentration, a 
pre-concentration step by means of evaporation was included in the 
sample pre-treatment. 

 For evaluating this approach, standard solutions containing 
1,000 µg L-1 of Br were reduced in volume from 4 mL to ?1 mL; the 
final volume was subsequently adjusted to 1 mL with Milli-Q water. 
The Br recovery obtained for standard solutions prepared in HNO3 was 
77 ± 5 % and the 81Br/79Br isotope ratio was 0.97284 ± 0.00008; for 
water-based standards, the recovery was 97 ± 9 % and the 81Br/79Br ratio 
was 0.97293 ± 0.00005, whereas for standards prepared in 5 mmol L-1



Chapter 6 

104 

?

NH3, a recovery of 98 ± 5 % and a 
81Br/79Br ratio of 0.97293 ± 0.00002 

were found. These ratios all compare favorably to the isotope ratio 
obtained for the standard after dilution only (0.97291 ± 0.00002). 

Figure 31. Effect of sample and standard Cl concentration on 81Br/79Br 
measurement results obtained using MC-ICP-MS (external correction in 
a SSB approach for correction for instrumental mass discrimination,

The presence of chlorine in post-column solutions may also 
lead to non-spectral effects [140]. Figure 31 presents the effect of Cl 
(added as NH4Cl) on the 

81Br/79Br isotope ratio measurement results, 
corrected for instrumental mass discrimination using external correction 
in a sample-standard bracketing approach. 

 It can be concluded from these results that matrix matching for 
Cl is necessary in order to achieve accurate 81Br/79Br ratio 
measurements, since a lower 81Br/79Br ratio than expected was obtained 
using samples containing higher Cl concentrations than the standards. 
On the other hand, when using standards containing higher Cl 
concentrations than the samples, the 81Br/79Br ratio was biased high. The 
same trend was observed using internal correction with an internal 
standard.

6.3.4. Analytical application 

Br standard solutions (with and without admixed Cl) and 
IRMM BCR-403 seawater reference material were used for method 
validation. 2 mL aliquots of these samples were passed through 1 mL of 
Dowex® 50WX8 (200 – 400 mesh) cationic exchange resin, followed 
by elution with 2 mL of milli-Q water. The total Br and Cl 
concentrations were measured using a quadrupole-based Elan DRCPlus
ICP-MS unit. All final sample and standard solutions contained 4,000 
µg L-1 of Br.  

Mass bias correction was performed using Cl-matched 
standards (concentration of Cl adapted to that of the sample) in a 
sample-standard bracketing approach. The Br isotope ratio results were 
expressed as ?81Br = [(Rsample-Rstandard)/Rstandard] x 1000, in which the 
standard is SMOB (Standard Mean Ocean Bromine) [5]. Although the 
precision of the ?81Br (SMOB) values calculated for the samples 
containing Cl was slightly affected by the Cl concentration, the results 
obtained for both, Br isotopic reference material NIST SRM 977 and 
seawater reference material (Table 19), are in accordance with the 
literature values [55,141].

7.1. Introduction 

The 37Cl/35Cl isotope ratio is considered a useful diagnostic 
parameter for geochemical processes in seawater, sea ice and the 
atmosphere [142-143]. However, high-precision isotopic analysis of 
Cl still is an analytical challenge. 

Several techniques have been deployed for the measurement 
of the Cl isotope ratio, including electron impact ionization mass 
spectrometry [144], IRMS [145], NCIMS [49] and more recently 
HR-CS MAS [52]. Unfortunately, these techniques are characterized 
by a number of drawbacks, such as the need for time-consuming 
sample preparation procedures, the occurrence of memory effects 
and/or a poor precision. 

PTIMS relying on the monitoring of the polyatomic Cs2Cl
+ 

ion, and IRMS are normally employed for Cl isotopic analysis and 
they have been applied to the measurement of the Cl isotope ratio in 
different samples, however, mass fractionation which is dependent of 
the Cl concentration was observed in the case of PTIMS [146-148]. 

The application of MC-ICP-MS to Cl isotopic analysis is far 
from trivial, mainly due to i) the low sensitivity, resulting from the 
high ionization potential of Cl (12.967 V), ii) the occurrence of 
spectral interference, mainly due to the formation of polyatomic ions 
containing elements, such as H, O, S and/or Ar – e.g., 16O18O1H+ and 
34S1H+, the signals of which overlap with that of 35Cl+, and 36Ar1H+, 
the signal of which overlaps with that of 37Cl+, iii) memory effects 
and iv) potential contamination from samples in HCl medium, 
routinely analyzed with this instrumentation [148-149]. 

The introduction of the target element Cl as a dry vapor has 
shown to be an efficient strategy to avoid or at least strongly reduce 
the level of spectral interference for Cl determination and isotopic 
analysis by ICP-MS, as it allows the separation of Cl from the matrix 
of the sample. In addition, the introduction of a dry aerosol using 
vapor generation, laser ablation (LA), ET), GC or a dessolvator 
system may improve the sensitivity due to the enhancement of the 
sample introduction efficiency [131, 148-150].  

Despite the fact that vapor generation has improved the 
capabilities for Cl determination and isotopic analysis via ICP-MS, 
the overall procedure is laborious and requires specific equipment 
and reagents, which on occasions prevents the use of an autosampler. 
The use of a wet plasma and sample introduction via conventional 



Chapter 7 

????

?

PN allows a simpler measurement protocol, use of the standard 
autosampler and an increased sample throughput with the standard 
MC-ICP-MS configuration [151].

Most of the current literature on isotopic standards for Cl 
presents the data as the ?37Cl value, calculated relative to Standard 
Mean Ocean Chloride (SMOC). However, it was reported that ?37Cl 
may range from -0.07 (Miyajima, Japan) to +0.08 (Woods Hole, US) 
‰ in seawater, depending on the geographical provenance of the 
sample [142]. In igneous rocks, a variation in ?37Cl (always relative 
to SMOC) from -0.85 to +0.25 was reported [132], for different 
commercially available inorganic standards, ?37Cl values from -2.24 
‰ (for KCl) to 0.92 ‰ (for HCl) were reported and for organic 
solvents from -5.01 ‰ (for 1,1,1-Trichloroethane) to +2.85 ‰ (for 
1,1-dichloroethene) [146]. 

The NaCl isotopic standards SRM 975 and SRM 975a, both 
from NIST (USA), and ISL-354, from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA, Austria) were used for evaluating the 
accuracy of the measurements. Those standards were accurately 
characterized in terms of their Cl isotopic composition by Wei, et al. 
[147], who reported 37Cl/35Cl isotope ratios of 0.319876 ± 0.000067 
for NIST SRM 975, of 0.319768 ± 0.000187 for NIST SRM 975a, 
and of 0.319549 ± 0.000044 for ISL-354. The ?37Cl values 
(expressed relative to SMOC) compiled by Brand et al. in an IUPAC 
Technical Report were +0.43 ‰ for NIST SRM 975, +0.2 ‰ for 
NIST SRM 975a and +0.05  ‰ for ISL-354 [152]. 

The aim of the present work was to assess the feasibility of 
traditional MC-ICP-MS (wet plasma conditions &amp;amp; use of PN for 
sample introduction) for high-precision isotopic analysis of Cl by 
adequately addressing the problems of spectral interference, low 
sensitivity and memory effects. After method optimization ?37Cl was 
determined for a number of commercially available standards.

analysis purity grade 14 mol L-1 HNO3 (ProLabo, Belgium) was 
further purified by sub-boiling distillation in PFA equipment. 
TraceSELECT® NH3 was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). 

Polypropylene chromatographic columns (Eichrom, USA) 
filled with 1 mL of Dowex® 50WX8 (200-400 mesh) cation 
exchange resin were used for matrix removal. Chlorine isotope 
measurements were carried out for NIST SRM 975a NaCl isotopic 
reference material (MD, USA), BCR CRM 579 reference material 
(mercury in coastal sea water) from the Institute for Reference 
Materials and Measurements of the European Commission (IRMM, 
Belgium) and in commercially available extra pure NaCl (batch # 
K04243400), pro analysis KCl (batch # K36308936641) and 
Suprapur NH4Cl (batch # B363143), all of which supplied by Merck 
(Germany). NH4SO4 was obtained from Merck (Suprapur purity). 
Individual 1,000 mg L-1 standard solutions of Cl, Na and Rh 
(Inorganic Ventures, the Netherlands) were used in the context of 
elemental assay via quadrupole-based ICP-MS. 

7.2.3. Analytical procedure 

Each sample or standard was prepared by loading a 
polypropylene chromatographic column filled with 1 mL of Dowex®

50WX8 cation exchange resin (previously washed with ultrapure 
water to remove soluble organic compounds) with 1 mL of solution 
containing 1,000 mg L-1 of Cl. The Cl-fraction (Cl- shows no affinity 
towards the resin) was eluted with 2 mL of milli-Q water and this 
fraction was diluted to a final volume of 10 mL.  

The Cl concentration, as well as the residual (post-column) 
Na concentration were determined using quadrupole-based ICP-MS 
after addition of Rh (final concentration of 1 µg L-1) as an internal 
standard. Chlorine quantification was carried out via external 
calibration (calibration curve). Standard, blank and sample solutions 
were prepared in 5 mmol L-1 NH3 in order to decrease memory 
effects. Sodium determination was carried out using solutions 
prepared in 0.07 mol L-1 HNO3.  

Chlorine isotope ratio measurements were performed in 
diluted samples with a Cl concentration of 100 mg L-1 (samples and 
standards were all prepared in 5 mmol L-1 NH3). In-between every 
two solutions, the sample introduction system was rinsed with 5

mmol L-1 NH3 solution during 3 min. The mass bias was corrected 
for using external correction in a SSB approach. 

7.3. Results and discussion 

7.3.1. Spectral interferences 

Chlorine isotope ratio measurements with MC-ICP-MS may 
suffer from severe spectral interference, depending on the 
composition of the sample, the analyte element concentration, the 
sample introduction system selected and the mass resolution used. 

After proper optimization of the instrument settings, a mass 
resolving power 10,000 (defined as R = m/?m, with ?m the 
difference between the masses where the analyte intensity amounts 
to 95% and 5% of the maximum signal intensity, respectively) was 
achieved. A resolving power corresponds to a mass resolution 
(R=m/?m with ?m the full peak width at 5% of its maximum peak 
height) of approximately 5,000 [135].  

The theoretical resolution required to resolve the analyte 
signal from that of the polyatomic ion, interfering at low mass 
resolution, at the m/z ratio of 35Cl+ is about 1,000 for 16O18O1H+ and 
5,100 for 34S1H+ (assuming equal intensities for analyte and 
interfering signal). At the m/z ratio of 37Cl+, a resolution of about 
3,900 is required for resolving the analyte signal from that of 36Ar1H+ 

(assuming equal intensities for analyte and interfering signal).  

The calculations of the resolutions required were done based 
on the atomic masses as provided by the Commission on Isotopic 
Abundances and Atomic Weights from the International Union of 
Pure and Applied Chemistry [153].  

The major cation load of seawater can be removed easily via 
the use of a cation exchange resin [149]. However, anions containing 
S (such as S04

2-) are self-evidently not expected to be removed using 
this approach, leading to the formation of 34S1H+ in the plasma. Cl 
can be isolated from other matrix compounds by alternative or 
additional approaches, such as precipitation using Ag+ [6], vapor 
generation and the use of high performance liquid chromatography 
or gas chromatography [132]. However, these approaches add 
complexity to the procedure; therefore, it was decided to rely on the 
pseudo-high resolution mode to resolve this interference.  



Chapter 7

?

Although sulfur is present in seawater, no signal for the 
34S1H+ polyatomic ion was observed for a seawater sample after 
submitting it to cation exchange chromatography, which is due to the 
low concentration of S compared to Cl–  in seawater, for which the 
[SO4

2-]/[Cl1-] ratio is, on average, 0.14 [139].  

Figure 32. Mass spectra recorded at an m/z  ratio of 35 (a) and of 37 (b) 
using MC-ICP-MS with sample introduction via conventional PN at 
pseudo high resolution (resolving power of approximately 10,000) for a 
standard solution containing 1 mg L-1 of Cl and 500 mg L-1 of S. 

In order to promote the formation of 34S1H+ and thus, to 
identify the exact positions of the signals of the analyte and 
interfering ions, the spectral peaks at m/z ratios of 35 and 37 (Figure 
32) were recorded for a standard solution containing 1 mg L-1 of Cl 
and 500 mg L-1 of S. As can be seen in Figure 32, it is possible to 
identify a narrow mass window in the lower mass range (left side) of 
the signal in both figures in which the signal derives solely from Cl. 
Hence, the final measurements (static mode) were performed in these 
narrow mass windows with regular monitoring for mass shift. 
Additionally, due to the use of wet plasma conditions, it is possible 
to observe a significant contribution of polyatomic ions containing O 
and H to the signal measured at an m/z ratio of 35 and containing Ar 
and H at an m/z ratio of 37. 

7.3.2. Memory effect 

Cl isotope ratio measurement via pneumatic nebulization 
(PN)-MC-ICP-MS is hindered by pronounced memory effects, 
which may also significantly affect isotope ratio measurements. 
Several wash solutions were studied in terms of washout behavior.

Rapid reduction of the Cl signal intensity back to background levels 
is desirable when using external correction in a sample-standard 
bracketing correction for mass bias [132, 151]. Three different wash 
solutions were evaluated: 0.14 mol L-1 HNO3, ultrapure water (as 
obtained from a Milli-Q system) and 5 mmol L-1 NH3. The standards 
were also prepared in the corresponding medium. 

Figure 33. Transient signals recorded for 35 Cl using conventional 
nebulization and MC-ICP-MS with aspiration of different wash 
solutions between successive injections of a 100 mg L-1 Cl standard.  
The standard solutions were prepared in the same medium. 

Figure 33 presents the effect of these three different wash 
solutions on the remaining signal after measuring a standard 
containing 100 mg L-1 of Cl and made up in the same medium. 
Under acidic conditions, the formation of HCl is favorable, which is 
not easily washed out due to vapor formation and retention of the 
vapor formed inside the spray chamber.  

7.3.3. Chlorine concentration and mass bias correction 

Due to its high ionization potential, the sensitivity 
demonstrated by ICP-MS for Cl is low when compared to other 
elements, an effect that is more pronounced using pneumatic 
nebulization due its low sample introduction efficiency when 
compared to vapor generation [131,149]. Therefore, establishing the 
minimum concentration required for Cl isotope measurement is a 
critical factor. Figure 34 presents the difference in accuracy and 
precision observed at different Cl concentrations. 



Chapter 7 

????

?

Under the conditions adopted in this work, the Cl isotope 
ratio could be measured with good accuracy and precision (37Cl/35Cl 
= 0.319765 ± 0.000022 for NIST SRM 975a, RSD ~ 0.007% for n = 
3) at a Cl concentration of ? 70 mg L-1. 

A high concentration of Cl is required due its low ionization 
efficiency, which is estimated according to the Saha equation to be 
approximately 0.9%, while for the majority of the elements 
commonly determined by ICP-MS, this value is higher than 90% 
[67], such that a Cl concentration approximately 100-fold higher 
than typical for other elements is required. 

Figure 34. Effect of Cl concentration on the Cl isotope ratio as 
measured using MC-ICP-MS (wet plasma conditions) in a solution of 
NIST SRM 975a NaCl (mass bias corrected for by external correction in 
a sample-standard bracketing approach, n=3).

The relatively high concentration of Cl required for high-
quality isotope ratio measurements via PN-MC-ICP-MS, is not 
problematic as the concentration of Cl in the natural sources of 
interest, such as seawater, is normally &gt;&gt; 100 mg L-1 [151].  

Mass bias correction was applied by external correction 
using an SSB approach. To obtain the best performance using this 
correction method, it is important that both, standard and sample 
solutions are matrix- and concentration-matched and the time 
interval between the measurement of two successive solutions 
(standard and sample or sample and standard) should not be too long. 
In this work, the major cation load of the samples was removed via 



Chapter 7

cation exchange chromatography and pronounced Cl memory effects 
were avoided by using 5 mmol L-1 NH3 as wash solution. Under 
these conditions, the time interval between the analyses of two 
solutions was limited to 3 min and external correction was proven 
feasible. 

7.3.4. Sample preparation and method accuracy 

Sample preparation was carried out by loading 1 mL of 
sample solution (e.g., seawater) into a polypropylene 
chromatographic column filled with 1 mL of Dowex® 50WX8 cation 
exchange resin and eluting the analyte fraction with 2 mL of milli-Q 
water. The resulting solution was then diluted to a final concentration 
of 100 mg L-1 of Cl in 5 mmol L-1 NH3. This approach allowed 
efficient removal of the major cation load – as confirmed by the 
absence of Na (&amp;lt;LOD = 0.1 µg L-1) in the post-column solution.  
Absence of Cl isotope fractionation was demonstrated by the results 
for ?37Cl in NH4Cl, analyzed before and after passage through the 
cation exchange column (Table 21).  

This comes as no surprise as Cl- is not expected to show any 
affinity towards the chromatographic resin. The results (Table 21) 
obtained for the seawater sample (BCR CRM 579) and for NIST 
SRM 975a were in good agreement with the values reported in the 
literature.  

A variation in ?37Cl from -0.07 to +0.08‰ has been reported 
for seawater; the reference value reported in Table 21 is the average

NaCl and KCl by Numata, et al.6 However, the values found by these 
authors, of +0.91 ± 0.15 for NaCl and -2.24 ± 0.07 for KCl, differ 
significantly from the values determined in the current work (Table 
21). These differences may be attributed to differences in the 
production process of the reagents or in the source of the salts. 

7.4. Conclusions 

Despite the occurrence of spectral interference, memory 
effects and the characteristic low sensitivity, isotopic analysis of Cl 
in seawater can be successfully performed using PN-MC-ICP-MS 
(wet plasma conditions). High mass resolution,  the use of 5 mmol L-
1 NH3 as a wash solution and a minimum Cl concentration of 70 mg 
L-1 were required to achieve accurate and precise results. The method 
is applicable to seawater samples and to saline solutions, after a 
simple chromatographic cleanup step. The proposed procedure is 
simpler and faster than other methods typically deployed for Cl 
isotopic analysis.

isotope ratio measurements in Antarctic sea ice

8.1. Introduction 

The increasing temperature in Earth’s atmosphere and oceans 
has been linked to the so-called global warming, which is considered to 
be a consequence of several human activities such as land-clearing, 
fossil-fuel burning, industrial activities and increasing the concentration 
of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere [154-155].  

One of the consequences from the increasing temperature is the 
decrease of the sea ice extension; this effect has been more notorious in 
the Arctic Ice and less clear in the Antartic due to its isolation by big 
amounts of cold water [156-157].  

Due to its whiteness, the surface of the sea ice normally reflects 
the sunlight back to space. When the sea ice surface is reduced, the 
sunlight focuses on the seawater, increasing the temperature of the 
oceans. As a consequence, the raise in atmospheric temperature is 
intensified [158]. 

Halogens may play an important role in global warming events 
when present in the environment due to a series of factors, such as 
destruction of the ozone layer through catalytic reactions, affecting the 
partitioning of HOx and NOx, oxidizing dimethyl sulphide and affecting 
the oxidation of volatile organic compounds, among others [118,125]. 
Nevertheless, the halogens have demonstrated great potential as proxies 
of polar ice extent and are related in concentration to sea water [125-
128, 139].  

Considering the importance of the sea ice towards a series of 
environmental phenomena such as influence in the polar albedo, oceanic 
circulation and the atmosphere-ocean transfer of heat, salts and gases 
[158], it is of vital importance to understand the mechanisms and 
timescales by which the sea ice interacts with other components of the 
Earth’s climate system, in order to be able to accurately predict both the 
nature and rate of future climate change.  However, the understanding of 
Earth’s climate system demands accurate and well-resolved records of 
sea ice extent and rates of change obtained from an independent and 
reliable sea ice proxy, but existing sea ice proxies suffer from 
limitations. 

Methanesulphonic acid, a product of ocean algae emissions, 
correlates with satellite observations of sea ice extent off the East 
Antarctic coast, but is reactive and remobilized in ice cores over 
centennial time scales [159]. Another example is related to Na in ice 
cores, that reflects glacial-interglacial sea ice variability, but on shorter 



Chapter 8

timescales is strongly influenced by meteorology as well as competing 
sea ice and open ocean emission sources. Diatom biomarkers recorded 
in Southern Ocean sediments are a specific proxy of sea ice extent, but 
suffer from low temporal and spatial resolution and are not preserved in 
some regions. Bromine and Cl determined in polar ice cores offer a 
novel solution to these limitations [158, 125-128].

Given the lack of studies on isotope ratio of halogens in sea ice 
and the importance associated to well resolved records of sea ice for the 
better understanding of the environmental phenomena which contributes 
to the sea ice melting and formation, the aim of this work is to evaluate 
the halogen isotope ratio in Antartic sea ice from different locations and 
different collection depths in order to evaluate their behavior in those 
samples. 

8.2. Experimental 

8.2.1. Instrumentation 

The isotope ratio measurements were carried out using a 
Thermo Scientific (Germany) Neptune MC-ICP-MS instrument, with a 
sample introduction system consisting of a 100 µL min-1 PFA nebulizer 
mounted onto a dual spray chamber, consisting of a cyclonic and a 
Scott-type sub-unit. The measurements were performed using static 
collection with Faraday cups connected to 1012 ? amplifiers. Gain 
calibration and baseline correction were performed before each 
measurement session. The operating parameters are summarized in 
Table 22. 

Quantification of Br, Cl and Na was carried out using a 
quadrupole-based Elan DRCPlus ICP-MS unit (Perkin Elmer, CT, 
USA). The nuclides monitored were 79Br, 35Cl, 23Na and 103Rh (as 
internal standard).

exchange resin were used for matrix removal. Chlorine and Br 
isotope measurements were carried out using a NIST SRM 975a 
NaCl and a NIST SRM 977 NaBr isotopic reference materials (MD, 
USA), respectively. These materials were used for mass bias 
correction and to check the method accuracy.

Individual 1,000 mg L-1 standard solutions of Br, Cl, Na, and

Suprapur® NH4SO4 was obtained from Merck. 

The certified seawater reference material BCR CRM 579 
(mercury in coastal sea water), from the Institute for Reference 
Materials and Measurements of the European Commission (IRMM, 
Belgium), was used. 

8.2.3. Analytical procedure 

Each sample or standard was prepared by loading up to 2 mL 
of sample into a polypropylene chromatographic column filled with 
1 mL of Dowex® 50WX8 cation exchange resin (previously washed 
with ultrapure water to remove soluble organic compounds), eluting 
with 2 mL of deionized water and diluting to a final volume of 10 
mL.  

The Br and Cl concentration, as well as the residual (post-
column) Na concentration were determined using quadrupole-based 
ICP-MS after addition of Rh (final concentration of 1 µg L-1) as an 
internal standard.  Quantification was carried out via external 
calibration (calibration curve). Standard, blank and sample solutions 
were prepared in 5 mmol L-1 NH3 in order to decrease memory 
effects. Sodium determination was carried out using solutions 
prepared in 0.07 mol L-1 HNO3.  

Bromine isotope ratio measurements were performed in 
diluted samples with a Br concentration of 3,000 µg L-1, whereas Cl 
isotope ratio measurements were performed in diluted samples with a 
Cl concentration of 100 mg L-1 (samples and standards were all 
prepared in 5 mmol L-1 NH3). A preconcentration step consisting of 
an evaporation on a hot plate at 90 °C for about 5 hours was carried 
out for the samples that presented Br concentration lower than 3,000 
µg L-1. No preconcentration step was required for Cl isotope ratio 
measurements. 

In-between every two solutions, the sample introduction 
system was rinsed with a 5 mmol L-1 NH3 solution for 3 min. The 
mass bias was corrected for using external correction in a SSB 
approach, matching the Cl concentration in the standards with the 
samples for Br isotope ratio measurements. 



Chapter 8

?

All measurements were performed using high resolution 
mode, measuring in the narrow mass window where the signal 
contribution is solely from Br or Cl isotopes. In order to promote the 
formation of 34S1H+ and then, to identify the narrow mass window 
for Cl isotopes, the optimization of this parameter was performed 
using a solution containing 1 mg L-1 of Cl and 500 mg L-1 of S. 

The values were calculated as ?X = [(Rsample-
Rstandard)/Rstandard] x 1000, where X= 

81Br or 37Cl, using as a standard 
the certified reference sea water BCR CRM 579. 

8.2.4. Collection of samples 

The samples were carefully collected in order to prevent 
contamination. The involved personnel was equipped with clean room 
garments (Tyvek overall, overshoes and polyethylene gloves) over their 
warm clothes, and items dedicated to sample collection and storage were 
cleaned and sealed in plastic bags.

equipment designed by Lannuzel, et al (2006) [160] in different depths

sample collection, the ice cores were triple bagged and stored at -18oC 
until processing in the laboratory for analysis. 

The collection of the samples was performed during the 
Australian-led Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiment-2 (SIPEX-2) 
marine expedition in 2012 (26 Sep–10 Nov), geographical location is 
64–65oS/116–121oE, presented in Figure 35. Three local sea water and 
ice samples were collected for comparison proposes.

8.3. Results and discussion 

8.3.1. Concentration of Br and Cl in sea ice 

The total concentration of Br and Cl was measured in the sea 
ice samples after the cation load removal through a cationic column.  

Chlorine and Br concentrations in the sea ice presented a linear 
correlation, with a slope of 0.0037 and a correlation coefficient of 
0.9896 (Figure 36). The determined slope is similar to the slope obtained 
by Morris, et al. (0.0035), which is considered as a signature of seawater 
and thus no bromine explosion effect could be observed from the sea ice 
measurements in this work. The concentration of Br in sea ice ranged 
from 700 to 31000 µg L-1 and for Cl from 200 mg L-1 to 8000 mg L-1. 
The variation in concentration was related to the depth of the sea ice 
collected; the more deep the sea ice was collected the lower the Cl and 
Br concentrations were. This finding might be related to desalination 
effect.  

The desalination process in sea ice (which is responsible for 
decreasing the concentration of elements in the sea ice when compared 
to seawater) is linked to gravity drainage and flushing [162]. The gravity 
drainage is explained as equilibrium of the salinity gradient in the 
interstitial brine that follows the temperature gradient in sea ice. With 
the cooling of ice from above during the winter, the brine density of the 
sea ice becomes unstable, maintaining the highest densities at the top of 
the ice, which may explain the results obtained in terms of 
concentration, as presented in Figure 36. However, depending on the 
permeability of the sea ice, a convective overturning of brine within the 
mushy ice may occur. The flushing effect is, however, explained as a 
sort of “wash out” of salty brine with fresh meltwater during summer, 
with the pressure over the meltwater working as the force to move 
downwards and to elute brine out [161-162].   



Chapter 8 

127 

?

In Figure 36 it is possible to observe a wide and linear range of 
concentrations of Br and Cl in the sea ice collected, suggesting that the 
desalination process acts similarly for both elements.  

Figure 36. Relation between Br and Cl concentrations, measured by 
ICP-MS, in the collected sea ice during the SIPEX-2 expedition.

Most of the sea ice collected, specifically stations 2, 6, 7 and 8 
is composed of granular sea ice (Figure 37) and columnar sea ice formed 
by sea water, supporting the idea that the decrease in the concentration is 
due to desalination from frozen sea water since only a small amount of 
sea ice is composed of snow. 

 The condition under which the sea ice was formed plays an 
important role to determine its structure. Frazil-ice crystals with granular 
texture are normally linked to the rapid freezing of the ocean surface 
while ice pancakes are usually formed under turbulent conditions. After 
the cover is formed, the ice starts to grow from the base to the surface, 
leading to the formation of crystals with elongated columnar texture. 

The formation of the sea ice in this work probably occurred by 
freezing seawater onto the underside of existing sea ice, tending to form 
columnar and granular ice. Only a small fraction of the sea ice studied 
here was composed by compacted snow as can be seen in Figure 37.

2 expedition. 

8.3.2. Isotopic composition of Br and Cl in sea ice 

All samples were analyzed regarding their Br and Cl isotope 
ratios. Figure 38 presents the results of the measurements. A trend is 
visible for both Br and Cl in the sea ice collected. It is possible to 
observe that fractionation is more pronounced in deepest samples, which 
may be explained by the fact that the deep sea ice is older than the top 
sea ice, being exposed to desalination more severely than the top sea ice. 
In this case, there is the possibility that during the sea ice formation and 
desalination the processes of gravity drainage and flushing promoted the 
fractionation of Br and Cl with approximately the same intensity for 
both elements, since their concentrations are also related. 

It is also possible to notice in Figure 38 that the stations 4 and 7 
do not present such a strong fractionation in the bottom of the sea ice as 
other stations. It is possible that, for these stations, there is a mixing of 
the composition of the sea ice (top and bottom sea ice) and therefore the 
homogenization of its composition.  

Moreover, the ? values determined in seawater samples were in 
agreement with the ?  values reported in the literature for seawater 
(about 0), demonstrating that no fractionation takes place in seawater. 
The determined ? values in the standards were in agreement with the 
certified values (approximately -0.7 for ?81Br and 0.2 for ?37Cl), 
attesting the accuracy of the method.

Due to the processes that the sea ice undergoes for its 
formation, including desalination, it is possible that (linked to the 
decrease of the Br and Cl concentration) some fractionation effects 
occur, mainly due to the low temperature of the medium and the relative 
low mass of these elements [161].  

Apparently, the process of desalination also plays a role in the 
isotope ratio of halogens due to differences in isotope migrations in the 
sea ice. Figure 39 presents the Br and Cl isotopic composition of the 
collected sea ice regarding the concentrations measured.

isotope ratio in the sea ice collected during the SIPEX-2 expedition.  

Figure 40 presents the relationship between the determined Br 
and Cl isotope ratio values. This may support the idea that both elements 
respond to the environmental processes at the same rate, and also that 
bromine explosion effects do not seem to play a role in their isotope 
composition, since variations in isotope composition are observed as a 
trend for both elements.

collected during the SIPEX-2.

8.4. Conclusions 

Differences in Br and Cl concentration in sea ice were 
observed. There is a general descending trend in the concentration of the 
halogens at greater depths for sea ice samples. The decrease in the 
concentrations of Br and Cl is probably related to the desalination 
process associated to sea ice formation, which also promoted the 
fractionation of their isotopes with a similar trend. The behavior of both 
elements is, somehow, linked.

Final Considerations

9. Final considerations 

Despite challenging, the use of SS-ETV-ICP-MS has proven to 
be a feasible approach for halogen determination in different matrices, 
with the potential of decreasing the amount of interferences and 
allowing calibration using aqueous standards to be carried out. 

The LOQs obtained by SS-ETV-ICP-MS were in general 
improved over those obtained by other approaches for halogen 
determination by ICP-MS, mainly due to the fact that no sample dilution 
is needed and to the high sample introduction efficiency of the ETV-
ICP-MS. The results demonstrate the feasibility of this technique for 
halogen analysis in different samples thus the methods can applied for 
real cases ranging from biological to environmental studies unrevealing 
the chemistry of halogens which has not been studied due to the 
limitation of measuring its concentration at low levels. 

Moreover, the use of slurry and liquid samples may be studied 
applying ETV-ICP-MS, which may improve the sample throughput and 
dispense the use of special apparatus for sample introduction into the 
ETV. 

LA-ICP-MS for direct solid sampling analysis, which is 
currently commercially available, has demonstrated to be a feasible 
technique for Br analysis in polymers, allowing its quantification by 
different straightforward approaches as the use of a single certified 
standard monitoring 12C+  

Halogen isotope analysis by MC-ICP-MS using conventional 
sample introduction systems also demonstrated to be a feasible and 
simple approach, eliminating the need for coupling with other 
techniques, such as gas chromatography or vapor generation, increasing 
the sample throughput and simplifying the procedure for analysis. The 
developed methods allowed accurate and precise isotope ratio 
measurements of Br and Cl and high sample throughput. 

The developed methods were applied for real environmental 
cases, helping to understand environmental phenomena as well as the 
investigation of possible contamination sources.
