We determined adjustments in physiology and morphology that allow Neotropical savanna trees from central Brazil (Cerrado)
to avoid water deficits and to maintain a nearly constant internal water balance despite seasonal changes in precipitation and
air saturation deficit (D). Precipitation in the study area is highly seasonal with about five nearly rainless months during which
D is two fold higher compared to wet season values. As a consequence of the seasonal fluctuations in rainfall and D, soil water
potential changes substantially in the upper 100 cm of soil, but remains nearly constant below 2 m depth. Hydraulic
architecture and water relations traits of Cerrado trees adjusted during the dry season to prevent increasing water deficits and
insure homeostasis in minimum leaf water potential ?L and in total daily water loss per plant (isohydry). The isohydric
behavior of Cerrado trees was the result of a decrease in total leaf surface area per tree, a strong stomatal control of
evaporative losses, an increase in leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity and leaf hydraulic conductance and an increase in the
amount of water withdrawn from internal stem storage, during the dry season. Water transport efficiency increased in the same
proportion in leaves and terminal stems during the dry season. All of these seasonal adjustments were important for
maintaining ?L above critical thresholds, which  reduces the rate of embolism formation in stems and help to avoid turgor loss
in leaf tissues still during the dry season. These adjustments allow the stems of most Cerrado woody species to operate far
from the point of catastrophic dysfunction for cavitation, while leaves operate close to it and experience embolism on a daily
basis, especially during the dry season.          .................................................................................................................................

A precipitação na área de estudo é fortemente sazonal, com cerca de cinco meses praticamente sem chuva durante os
quais D é duas vezes maior aos valores medidos na época chuvosa. Como conseqüência da flutuação sazonal das
chuvas e de D, o potencial hídrico do solo muda substancialmente, nos primeiros 100 cm do solo, mas permanece quase

árvores do Cerrado se ajustaram durante a estação seca para evitar o déficit hídrico crescente e assegurar a homeostase
nos valores mínimos de potencial hídrico foliar ?L e na perda total diária de água pela planta (iso-hidria). O
comportamento iso-hídrico das árvores do Cerrado foi o resultado de uma diminuição da superfície foliar total por
árvore, um forte controle estomático das perdas por evaporação, um aumento na condutividade hidráulica específica da
folha e na condutância hidráulica foliar e um aumento da quantidade de águas retirada dos reservatórios internos do
caule, durante a estação seca. A eficiência no transporte de água aumentou, nas mesmas proporções, nas folhas e nos
ramos terminais durante a estação seca. Todos estes ajustamentos sazonais foram importantes para a manutenção de ?L
acima de limiares críticos, com isto contribuindo para uma redução na formação de embolismos nos ramos e ajudando a
evitar a perda de turgor em tecidos foliares durante a época seca. Esses ajustes permitem que os ramos das espécies
lenhosas do Cerrado operem bem distanciados do ponto de disfunção catastrófica para a cavitação, enquanto as folhas
operam próximas e sofrem embolismos em uma base diária, especialmente durante a estação seca.

INTRODUCTION
Trees growing in tropical environments characterized

by distinct wet and dry seasons have to seasonally
a d j u s t  t h e i r  m o r p h o - p h y s i o l o g i c a l  t r a i t s  t o  c o p e
successfully with changes in soil water availability.
Intuitively the most obvious responses of a plant to cope
with limited water availability in a strong seasonal
environment would be a reduction in transpiration by
stomatal limitation and/or dropping the leaves to further
decrease evaporative water loss during the dry season.
Many tree species growing in tropical dry forests are
deciduous, dropping their leaves at the beginning of the
dry season and producing a new crop of leaves at the
beginning of the wet season (Borchert, 1994; Rivera et al.,
2002). Their seasonal growth rates are well coupled to the
seasonal changes in the availability of the main limiting
resource: water. In contrast, physiological activity and
growth rates of savanna trees are uncoupled from
seasonal changes in precipitation (Gouveia, 1998;
Meinzer et al., 1999; Prado et al., 2004; Simioni et al., 2004;
Damascos et al., 2005; Bucci et al., 2005; Franco et al.,
2005; Hoffmann et al., 2005), even though the seasonal
pattern of precipitation is similar to that of dry forests.
Indeed, seasonally deciduous or semideciduous forests
occur throughout the savanna region in Central Brazil on
rich Ca and Mg soils (Ratter et al., 1978).

The climate of savanna ecosystems of Central Brazil
(Cerrado) is characterized by five months with very few
rainfall events and a long period with high precipitations.
Evaporative demand is substantially higher during the

dry season (May to September) because of lower ambient
relative humidity. The combination of higher evaporative
demand and low precipitation during the dry season
makes the Cerrado a potentially stressful environment for
vascular plants. Despite stressful conditions during the
rainless season, many tree species maintain an active
crop of leaves during this period and new leaves are
produced before the beginning of the wet season (Franco
et al., 2005; Lenza and Klink, 2006). Stem growth rates
increase after the first large rainfall pulses of the wet
season and high growth rates are maintained until two to
three months before the end of the wet season in early
M a r c h  ( S a r a c e n o ,  2 0 0 6 ) .  I t  i s  l i k e l y  t h a t  p h o t o -
assimilates, at this point in time, are channeled to
enhance root growth, instead of stem growth, to insure
water uptake during the dry season. The production of
new leaves by savanna trees during the most unfavorable
period for growth may be an adaptive response to the low
nutrient availability in the soil (Sarmiento et al., 1985).
The presence of completely expanded leaves before the
first rainfall events can help to reduce nutrient leaching
f r o m  l e a v e s  b e c a u s e  t h e i r  c u t i c l e  w o u l d  b e  f u l l y
developed, making them less leachable compared to
expanding leaves. Minimizing nutrient losses and at the
same time decreasing leaf losses to herbivores, which are
less active at the end of the dry season (Marquis et al.,
2002), is advantageous in terms of nutrient and carbon
balance. Nevertheless, maintaining leaves as well as
producing new leaves during the dry season incurs a
carbon cost for savanna trees. They have to cope with



235

HYDRAULIC ARCHITECTURE AND WATER RELATIONS OF CERRADO TREES

the higher cost of maintaining long and deep roots to tap
water from abundant and more stable water sources
available at depth (Scholz et al., 2008a). Even though
most Cerrado trees have more than 50% of their biomass
belowground (Sarmiento, 1983; Castro and Kauffman,
1998), some Cerrado woody species have relatively
shallow root systems (Scholz et al., 2008a).

To avoid losing leaves during the unfavorable growth
period, species from other seasonal ecosystems undergo
osmotic adjustment in their photosynthetic and other
metabolically active tissues to avoid losing cell turgor
when water is depleted in the soil and plant water
potential becomes more negative. Other changes in leaf-
water relations characteristics may include a decrease in
the modulus of elasticity (Turner and Jones, 1980).
However, if woody Cerrado species are isohydric
(Franco, 1998; Meinzer et al., 1999; Prado et al., 2004;
Bucci et al., 2005), then osmotic adjustment or any other
change in pressure volume relationships in leaves during
the dry season may not be needed. Different types of
physiological and morphological adjustments that allow
the trees to maintain leaf water potentials (?L) above the
turgor loss point during the dry season are possible. The
first objective of this study was to asses if dominant
Cerrado woody species are isohydric, meaning that they
maintain similar minimum ?L throughout the year
(Tardieu and Simonneau, 1998). The term isohydry is
used interchangeably with homeostasis in minimum ?L in
this study. The second objective was to discuss the
c u r r e n t  k n o w l e d g e  a n d  n e w  d a t a  c o n c e r n i n g
physiological and morphological adjustments which
favor the water balance of Cerrado woody species during
the dry season. The third objective was to assess the
degree of coordination between stem and leaf hydraulics
to help identify additional mechanisms governing the
regulation of internal water balance of savanna trees.

MATERIAL  AND METHODS

Study site and plant material: The study was conducted
in savanna sites with intermediate tree density (cerrado
sensu stricto) at the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e
Estatística (IBGE) Ecological Reserve, a field experimental
station located 33 km south of Brasilia (15o 56’S, 47o 53’W,
altitude 1100 m). Annual precipitation in the reserve
ranges from 880 to 2150 mm depending on the year with a

mean of approximately 1500 mm (www.recor.org.br). There is
a pronounced dry season from May through September
with the months of June, July and August being nearly
rainless. Mean monthly temperature ranges from 19 to 23 oC
with diurnal temperature variations of 20 oC being common
during the dry season. The soils are deep oxisols containing
about 70% clay. The development of micro aggregate
structures (e.g. cementation by iron oxides) allows Cerrado
soils to be generally porous and well drained despite their
high clay content (Furley and Ratter, 1988).

An extensive data set collected over 10 years (1996 to
2006) from 12 dominant woody species ranging from
evergreen to brevideciduous and deciduous (Meinzer et
al., 1999; Bucci et al., 2004a,b; Bucci et al., 2005; Bucci et al.,
2006; Scholz et al., 2006; Scholz et al., 2007; Bucci et al.,
2008; Goldstein et al., 2008; Hao et al., 2008; Scholz et al.,
2008a,b) was used in this study in addition to previously
unpublished data. The species studied, their family, leaf
phenology and measured morphological and physiological
variables in each species are listed in Table 1.

Soil water potential and volumetric water content: Soil
water potential was measured using soil psychrometers
(PST-55, Wescor, Logan, UT) which were deployed at
0.20, 0.30, 0.60 and 1.00 m below the soil surface. The
psychrometers were connected to a data logger (CR-7,
Campbell Scientific, Logan, Utah, USA). Soil volumetric
water content was measured with highly sensitive probes
containing eight annular capacitance sensors (Sentek
PTY LTD, Adelaide, Australia) positioned at several
depths down to 250 cm. Technical details for both
methods are described in Bucci et al. (2008).

Leaf area index: Leaf area index of woody species was
estimated with a LAI 2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer (LI-
COR Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) during wet (October,
February and April) and dry (May, June and August)
seasons as described previously (Hoffmann et al., 2005;
Bucci et al., 2008).

Sapwood and leaf water potential, and turgor loss
point: Sapwood water potential (?_sw) was measured in
one representative tree per species during the dry season
with in situ stem psychrometers (Plant Water Status
Instruments, Guelph, Ontario, Canada) and recorded with
a datalogger (CR-7, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA)
at 10-min intervals as described in Scholz et al. (2007).

Minimum leaf water potential (?L) was measured with a
pressure chamber (PMS Instruments, Corvallis OR, USA)

individuals per species during the dry season (August-
Setember) and wet season (February-March). The bulk
leaf turgor loss point (?0) was determined from pressure-
volume relationships (Tyree and Hammel, 1972) for three,
fully developed exposed leaves from three individuals per
species during the dry and wet seasons.

R o o t  a n d  l e a f  h y d r a u l i c  p r o p e r t i e s  a n d  s t o m a t a l
conductance: Total hydraulic conductivity (Lp) was
measured in roots of B. crassa, B. salicifolius, K.
coriaceae and Q. parviflora collected between 0530 and
0700 h in January (wet season) and August (dry season)
as described in Scholz et al., (2008a).The Lp (m s-1 MPa-1)
was calculated as Lp = (?Qv/?P)(1/A) where Qv (m

3 s-1) is
volumetric flow rate, P (MPa) is the pressure applied, and
A (m2) is the lateral surface area of the root segment
(Nobel, Schulte and North, 1990).

Leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity (KL; kg m
-1 s-1

MPa-1) was measured in three branches excised before
dawn from three to five individuals per species during dry
and wet seasons according to Bucci et al., (2004a) and
Bucci et al., (2006). Branches were immediately re-cut
under water and attached to a hydraulic conductivity
apparatus (Tyree and Sperry, 1989). Leaf-specific
conductivity was calculated as the mass flow rate divided
by the pressure gradient across the branch segment and
normalized by the total leaf area distal to the stem. Stem
vulnerability curves, to estimate the pressure at 50
percent of loss conductivity (P50stem), were determined by
measuring percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity due
to embolism over a range of water potential reached
during dehydration by the bench drying method (Sperry
et al., 1988). Details about stem vulnerability curves are
described in Bucci et al., (2006) and Hao et al., (2008).

Leaf hydraulic vulnerability curves were determined
measuring leaf hydraulic conductance (KLeaf) following
the partial rehydration method described by Brodribb and
Holbrook, (2003). Three leaves of five different trees per
species were used to measure KLeaf and to estimate the

pressure at 50 percent of loss conductivity (P50leaf).
Capacitance values both before and after turgor loss
point (?0) were calculated from leaf pressure-volume
relations as described in Hao et al., (2008).

A steady state porometer (model LI-1600, LI-COR Inc.,
Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) was used to measure stomatal
conductance (gs) of three to seven leaves on the same
trees used to measure ?L, every 2 to 3 h during one day of
dry and wet season and the maximum values as taken for
this study. New, fully expanded leaves from sun-exposed
areas of the crown were used for measurements.

Tr a n s p i r a t i o n  a n d  s t e m  w a t e r  s t o r a g e :   T h e  h e a t
dissipation method (Granier, 1985, 1987) was used to
measure the mass flow of water in ten out of the 12
species (three to five individuals per species) during two
to five consecutive days at the end of the dry season
(August and September) and at the peak of the wet
season (January and February). Transpiration per unit
leaf area (E) was obtained by dividing the mass flow of
sap measured near the base of the main stem of each tree
by the total leaf area per plant according to Meinzer et al.,
(1999) and Bucci et al., (2005). Total leaf area per plant was
obtained by multiplying the number of leaves per plant by
the average projected area per leaf, determined from a
sub-sample of 10-50 leaves per plant.

To determine daily utilization of stored water for
transpiration, sap flow was measured simultaneously in
terminal branches and near the base of the main stem in
six of study species as described in Scholz et al., (2008b).
Stem water storage (ws) calculations were based on the
method described by Goldstein et al., (1998).

RESULTS
Precipitation in the study area is highly seasonal with

a b o u t  f i v e  n e a r l y  r a i n l e s s  m o n t h s  ( M a y  t h r o u g h
September, Figure 1). Mean daily air saturation deficit (D)
is twice as great toward the end of the dry season
compared to wet season values. As a consequence of the
seasonal fluctuations in precipitation and D, soil water
potential fluctuated substantially in the upper 100 cm of
soil. Average soil water potential, between 20 and 100 cm
depth, ranged from 0 MPa in the rainy season to about -
2.0 MPa near the end of the dry season (Figure 2a). Soil
water storage (the total amount of water in the upper 250
cm of the soil profile excluding the first 10 cm) also

changed seasonally. It decreased from about 400 mm in
the wet season to about 230 mm at the peak of the dry
season (Figure 2b).  This would imply that the vegetation
had used about 170 mm of water up to the peak of the dry
season if one assumes that the period was rainless, and
that there was neither lateral flow nor deep percolation.
Tree and shrub leaf area index responded to changes in
soil water availability decreasing from 1.4 m2 m-2 in the wet
season to about 1 m2 m-2 at the peak of the dry season.

Several scaling relationships between leaf functional
traits or between leaf traits and branch architectural traits
across species were identified. In some cases only one
mathematical function was enough to describe scaling
relationships for both wet and dry season data, and in
other cases two functions were used to describe dry and

dry and wet seasons for all four species (Figure 9). Within
species, the minimum sapwood water potential (?sw) was
on average 1.2 MPa more positive than the minimum ?L
(Table 2). Leaves of Cerrado tree species were more
vulnerable to cavitation than their terminal stems,

each species during the wet season compared to the dry
season. Lower AL:AS during the dry season was the result
of a decrease in total leaf surface area per tree rather than
changes in the cross sectional area of active stem xylem
tissue.

Leaf hydraulic conductance (KLeaf) was higher and
total root hydraulic conductivity (Lp) was lower during
the dry season, compared to wet season values, in four
dominant Cerrado species (Figure 8). The differences
between dry and wet season values were significant in all
four species for KLeaf, but for only 2 species for Lp. A

Figure 7. Leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity in relation
to leaf area to sapwood area ratios (AL:AS) measured during
the wet season (filled symbols) and dry season (open
symbols) for ten dominant woody Cerrado species. Each
point represents the mean values ± SE of three to five
trees per species. The line is the exponential decay
function fitted to the data (y = 3.87 * 18.7 (exp (-30.8x)); P
&amp;lt;0.0001).

Brazilian Cerrado is influenced by the seasonal pattern of
precipitation and by the plastic responses of root growth
and physiology to variation in belowground resources.
Despite a 4- to 5-month dry season, the presence of
abundant moisture at depths below 2 m (Quesada et al.,
2 0 0 4 ,  2 0 0 8 )  s u g g e s t s  t h a t  m u c h  o f  t h e  a n n u a l
precipitation remains unexploited by the deep roots of
woody plants. Seasonal variations in water availability
across the soil profile result in different patterns of water
uptake by woody plants, which differ depending on their
leaf phenology (deciduous, brevideciduous, evergreen)
and root architecture (monomorphic in evergreen species
and dimorphic in brevideciduous and deciduous species)
(Scholz et al., 2008a). Adequate water supply appears to
be a prerequisite for the species to maintain similar
midday minimum leaf water potentials in both seasons.
Consistent with the isohydric behavior of Cerrado tree
species, osmotic adjustment in the leaves did not occur:
the osmotic potential at zero turgor remained unchanged

environmental conditions (e.g. Larcher, 1980; Frank et al.,
2007). Isohydry is generally attributed to strong stomatal
control of transpiration which results in similar midday
?L regardless of soil moisture and D (Frank et al., 2007).
Stomatal conductance of anysohydric plants, on the
other hand, is less responsive to variations in D and soil
moisture, allowing large seasonal fluctuations in tissue
water potentials. A third mode of behavior was recently
suggested by Frank and coworkers, (2007) in which soil-
to-leaf water potentials are maintained seasonally
constant but ?L fluctuates in synchrony with seasonal
v a r i a t i o n s  i n  s o i l  w a t e r  a v a i l a b i l i t y.  M o s t  o f  t h e
mechanisms used to explain isohydric behavior are based
on stomatal sensitivity to changes in atmospheric or soil
moisture. However there are several other potential
mechanisms that can help in maintaining seasonal
constancy of plant water status, including the utilization
of internal water reservoirs, changes in the total amount
of gas exchange surface per plant, changes in the
patterns of water uptake, and variations in the hydraulic
architecture of plants.

from wet to dry seasons and consequently, leaves of all
tree species were able to maintain positive turgor
pressure at midday. The contribution of superficial roots
to the water economy of the trees during the dry season
was very small because of limited soil water availability in
the upper soil layers and also because of seasonal
increases in hydraulic resistance of shallow roots (Domec
et al., 2006; Scholz et al., 2008a). The occurrence of
hydraulic lift in several Cerrado woody species (Scholz et

Figure 8. Leaf hydraulic conductance (KLeaf) and total
root hydraulic conductance (Lp) measured during the wet
(filled bars) and dry (open bars) seasons in four dominant
woody Cerrado species. Values of KLeaf are means + SE of

three to six different roots measured in different trees.
Significant differences between seasons are indicated as:

al., 2002; Moreira et al., 2003; Meinzer et al., 2004; Scholz
et al., 2008a) partially mitigates but is not sufficient to
prevent a substantial loss of Lp in shallow roots during
the dry season (Figure 8b). Avoiding complete root
rectification sensu Nobel and Sanderson (1984) may be
useful for maintaining arbuscular mycorrhiza and
nitrogen fixing bacteria inside the roots alive.

At the whole-plant level, total daily water loss was
similar during the dry season compared to the wet season
(Bucci et al., 2005). The large impact of a two-fold
increase in D would have had on transpiration during the
dry season was partially compensated by a decrease in
stomatal conductance. Strong stomatal limitation to
transpiration in response to increases in D was not
sufficient to prevent transpiration per unit leaf surface
area from increasing during the dry season. Therefore,

concomitant increase in KL (Figure 7). An additional
mechanism contributing to the seasonal homeostasis was
the increase in the amount of water withdrawn from the
stem storages during the daytime. Utilization of water
stored in stems increased by 10 % during the dry season
compared to the wet season (Figure 5).

Leaves constitute an important hydraulic bottleneck in
the water transport pathway of plants, representing more
than 30% of whole plant resistance in the root to leaf
continuum (Brodribb et al., 2002; Sack et al., 2003). Leaves of
Cerrado woody plants appear to be more vulnerable to
embolism than their terminal stems to which they are
attached (Table 2 and Hao et al., 2008). Stem xylem in Cerrado
species operates far from the point of catastrophic
dysfunction sensu Tyree and Sperry (1988), while leaves
operate at substantially more negative leaf water potentials.
Cavitation commonly occurs in leaves (e.g. Canny, 2001;
LoGullo et al., 2003; Woodruff et al., 2007). Embolism repair
involving the occurrence of transient pressure changes
resulting from diurnal variations in the amount of
osmotically active solutes inside cells surrounding leaf
vascular bundles, has been documented for petioles of
Cerrado trees (Bucci et al., 2003). On the other hand,
embolism formation and refilling is probably of limited
significance for Cerrado woody plant stems. Compared to
stems, diurnal refilling in leaves may be less energetically
costly and may involve simpler mechanisms (Bucci et al.,
2003; Brodribb and Holbrook, 2004). Consequently, a large
safety margin between minimum ? and P50´s, will be required
for stems to avoid the need of embolism repair in xylem
conduits. On the other hand, from an adaptive point of view,

embolism formation and repair in the leaf lamina may be a
means of amplifying the evaporative demand signal to the
stomata in order to expedite a stomatal response (Brodribb
and Holbrook, 2004).

Leaf hydraulic conductance and KL, estimates of leaf
and stem water transport efficiency, respectively,
increase in a coordinated manner during the dry season.
Hydraulic efficiency increases in the same proportion in
stem and leaves, from the wet to dry seasons (Figure 9).
This hydraulic adjustment of stems and leaves during the
least favorable period for metabolic and physiological
activities in Cerrado plants should improve the delivery
of water to the leaf cells and may contribute to insure the
isohydric behavior of Cerrado trees. Increases in water
transport efficiency of stems can be, at least partially,
explained by a reduction in the leaf surface distal to
terminal stem segments during the dry season. The
mechanisms that could explain the enhancement of leaf
hydraulic conductance during the dry season is not
k n o w n ,  h o w e v e r  t h e  o n t o g e n e t i c  s t a g e  i n  l e a f
development (e.g. newly expanding and fully mature
leaves) may have an influence on the movement of water
within leaves (Brodribb and Holbrook, 2005).

CONCLUSIONS
Adjustments in hydraulic architecture and water relations
traits of Cerrado trees during the dry season prevented
increased water deficits and insured homeostasis in
minimum ?L and total daily water loss per plant. The
isohydric behavior of Cerrado trees was the result of
strong stomatal control of evaporative losses, a decrease

in total leaf surface area per tree, an increase in KLeaf and
KL and an increase in the amount of water withdrawn from
internal stem storage during the dry season. Daily repair
of cavitated vessels in leaves, which appears to be less
costly than in stems, is apparently necessary to insure
adequate delivery of water to leaf tissues on a long term
basis. All of these processes are of importance for
maintaining ?L above critical thresholds, which probably
reduces the rate of embolism formation in stems and helps
to avoid turgor loss in leaf tissues, and consequently
