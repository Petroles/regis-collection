Abstract

Fault reactivation resulting from pore pressure changes may be accompanied by seismic
activity, subsidence, well damage and the creation of fluid leakage paths. To ensure
acceptable reservoir performance in hydrocarbon production, it is critical to assess the
reactivation tendencies of existing faults. In this work, a numerical approximation is
presented that allows quasi-static deformation coupled with monophasic flow considering
compressible constituents. Two dimensional modeling is carried out using the theory of
linear poroelasticity and a new treatment of poroelastic equations defined into a multi-
physics data structure. Dimensionless forms of poroelasticity equations are presented and
several analytic and semi analytic solutions, as well as poroelastic inclusion theory were
reproduced with the proposed implementation in order to validate it. The computational
model is used to evaluate the stress changes around and into the reservoir in order to assess
the fault reactivation tendency at different scenarios. Fault reactivation tendency result-
ing from induced stress changes was calculated using the Coulomb failure stress change
method for definition of the shear slip potential along pre-existing faults at one specific
time associated to pore pressure change. It was found that fault reactivation tendency
depends on the reservoir geometry, poroelastic properties of the reservoir and surround-
ing rocks, reservoir geometry, static friction coefficient, and pore pressure distribution.
A numerical study about the accuracy of surrounding material dimensions is presented
and several scenarios with different depletion programs were evaluated to determine the
influence of the production rates over fault reactivation tendency.

Keywords: Poroelasticity, Finite Element Method, Galerkin Method, Faults (Geology).

Resumo

A reativac?a?o de falhas, resultante de variac?o?es na pressa?o de poros, pode ocasionar ativi-
dades s??smicas, subside?ncia, dano nos poc?os e criac?a?o de caminhos de escape dos fluidos
contidos nos reservato?rios. Para se garantir uma produc?a?o de hidrocarbonetos eficiente,
mostra-se um fator cr??tico a avaliac?a?o das tende?ncias de reativac?a?o das falhas existentes no
meio poroso. Neste trabalho, apresenta-se uma aproximac?a?o nume?rica para uma ana?lise
de deformac?a?o quase-esta?tica com escoamento monofa?sico, considerando a compressibil-
idade da rocha e dos fluidos. Um modelo bidimensional foi empregado considerando a
teoria de poroelasticidade linear e un novo tratamento da poroelasticidade atrave?s de
estruturas de dados multif??sicos. Formas adimensionais das equac?o?es de poroelastici-
dade sa?o apresentadas, juntamente com a reproduc?a?o de diversas soluc?o?es anal??ticas e
semi-anal??ticas das mesmas em semiespac?os, com o propo?sito de se validar o algoritmo
desenvolvido. O modelo computacional foi utilizado para avaliar as mudanc?as de tensa?o,
no reservato?rio e em suas fronteiras, com o objetivo de se estudar as tende?ncias reativac?a?o
de falhas em diferentes cena?rios. As tende?ncias de reativac?a?o de falhas, resultantes da
induc?a?o de variac?o?es de tensa?o na rocha, foram calculadas atrave?s do me?todo de variac?a?o
de tensa?o de ruptura de Coulomb para a definic?a?o das sec?o?es com potencial de desloca-
mento por tenso?es cisalhante das falhas pre-existentes em tempos espec??ficos, associados
com as alterac?o?es na pressa?o de poros. Mostrou-se que a reativac?a?o de falhas depende da
geometria de reservato?rio, das propriedades poroela?sticas da rocha, coeficiente de atrito
e a distribuc?a?o da pressa?o de poros. Um estudo sobre precisa?o dos calculos baseado na
dimensa?o do material circundante e? apresentada e va?rios cena?rios com diferentes progra-
mas deplec?a?o foram avaliados para determinar a influe?ncia das taxas de produc?a?o sobre
a tende?ncia de reactivac?a?o das falhas.

1. Introduction

1.1 Research motivation

Porous media like rocks are solid skeletons containing pores connected and filled with
fluids in different phases (gas, oil and water). The deformation of the solid matrix and
the flow of fluids are intrinsically coupled; for practical purposes, it can be neglected,
but the manifestation of the pore pressure effect of solid deformation made it an impor-
tant phenomenon in a number of engineering situations. A good grasp of this physical
mechanism can equip engineers with the necessary insight to diagnose the poroelastic
effect for their problems on hand. In general, the diffusion of fluid pressure is followed by
the deformation of the porous rock and is a time-dependent process. The mathematical
theory of linear poroelasticity was first established by Terzaghi (1943) and Biot (1941).
From this time forth, poroelasticity has had many important applications in different ar-
eas: petroleum engineering, civil engineering and biomedical engineering. Specifically in
petroleum engineering, the effective management of underground fluid extraction relies
on the trustworthy evaluation of the subsidence of the ground surface, fault reactivation,
well damage and the creation of fluid leakage paths in the recent applications. However,
linear poroelastic problems that can be solved analytically are limited due to the complex
coupled nature of the problem. In particular for reservoir fault reactivation, several ana-
lytical and semi-analytical approaches have been developed with several limitations and
ideal assumptions.
In practical applications, generally, we have to seek numerical solutions as tools for solving
this kind of problems. In the numerical approximation of geomechanical consolidation, the
most popular numerical method is the continuous Galerkin (CG) finite element method in
particular in commercial finite element packages. In this work, a non-commercial imple-
mentation oriented to solve fault reactivation problems by means of the inclusion theory
in linear poroelasticity is developed. Consequently, it can be used to model problems with
very complex geometries, material contrast, as well as it can exploit the advantages of
numerical approximations.

1.2.1 Poroelasticity in reservoir engineering

Muskat, in the 1930’s, considered storage effects resulting primarily from fluid expan-
sion and assumed that rocks were considered as an incompressible material at reservoir
depths. Fluid expansion, however, could not explain the extra production in the East
Texas Oil Field. He deemed the high production to be due to highly compressible gas
or water drive mechanism from the reservoir peripheries. Jacob (1940) suggested alter-
natively that the high production rate was due to the compressibility of sand and clays.
Initially, poroelasticity was used in petroleum engineering to understand subsidence, es-
timate hydrocarbon volumes and predict stresses around boreholes. The subsidence of
Goosse Creek oil field described by Pratt (1926) was the first conceptual realization of
the coupling between large volumes of fluid extraction and large scale mechanical defor-
mation. Since the problem of large groundwater withdrawals from aquifers is identical,
Geertsma, who was affiliated with Shell in the Netherlands, studied the effect of pore fluid
decline on volumetric changes of rocks (Geertsma, 1957). The groundwater subsidence
literature in the 1970’s used analytical and numerical techniques introduced by Geertsma
and most recently used by Segall to connect hydrocarbon extraction with induced seismic-
ity (Segall, 1987). Poroelasticity research in the 1940’s and 1950’s was oriented primarily
toward rock mechanics. Hughes (1953) made laboratory measurements of pore compress-
ibilities to correct the available pore space at reservoir conditions. Poroelasticity research
continues in petroleum engineering and geophysics in the use of hydraulic fracturing as
a technique for measuring earth stresses, geomechanical behavior of reservoirs and its in-
teractions with side-burden rocks, faults, and another structural elements (Germanovich,
2004).

1.2.2 Induced seismicity

Injection induced seismicity

Currently, it is widely accepted that fluid injection into the subsurface environment does
induce seismicity, in other words the fluid injection can trigger small earthquakes that
evidence the induced seismicity (i.e, the in-situ stress changes along an existing fault
or fracture of an extremely low seismic magnitude). The most well-known example of
injection-induced seismicity is probably given by the earthquakes triggered by fluid injec-
tion at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal (RMA), northeast of Denver, Colorado in 1967 (Hsieh
and Bredehoeft, 1981). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers drilled deep injection wells at
RMA in 1962 for disposal of contaminated waste water. Waste fluid was injected into a



1.2. Literature review 3

fractured reservoir in the Precambrian bedrock below the RMA between 1962 and 1966.
During this 4-year period, a total of 625 million of liters of waste fluid were disposed off in
the wells. Shortly after the injection of fluids started, small earthquakes were detected in
the Denver area. There was an apparent correlation between the volume of fluid injected
into the well and the number of earthquakes generated. In 1967, one year after the fluid
injection was interrupted, there were three major earthquakes in the Denver area. This
was attributed to the migration of the pressure front developed (Hsieh and Bredehoeft,
1981). After 1967, the number of earthquakes began to decline and by the 1980’s, the
swarm of seismic activity had virtually disappeared.
Another example of experimentation with fluid injection-induced seismicity is given by
the German Continental Deep Drilling Program (KTB), which was designed to increase
the knowledge of crustal stresses based on borehole measurements and to directly test
the frictional equilibrium hypothesis by evaluating whether relatively small pore pressure
perturbations could trigger micro-earthquakes (Zoback and Harjes, 1997). The injection
of 200 m3 of KBr/KCl brine into a 70 m open-hole section at the bottom of the 9.1 km
main borehole induced almost 400 micro-earthquakes at an average depth of 8.8 km. Most
of the earthquakes were determined to be strike-slip events by focal plane mechanisms
and had a NNW trending, essentially parallel to the major horizontal compressive stress.
The largest induced earthquake, of magnitude M = 1.2, occurred 18 h after the beginning
of injection (Zoback and Harjes, 1997). The study suggested that many earthquakes were
induced by very small pore pressure changes ( 1 MPa) less than 1 percent more than the
surrounding (approximately hydrostatic) pore pressure at depth.
The exploitation of the Romashikinskoye oil field, the largest in Europe, located on the
south part of the Tatarstan arch (Russia), began in the 1960’s using water flooding as
a secondary recovery method (Galybin, 1998). Observations showed that there was a
time-dependent correlation between the beginning of the water injection and the seismic
activity. Based on these observations, Galybin (1998) developed a quantitative mechanical
model to address the influence of pore pressure on fault movements. He followed the
original work by Hubbert (1959) and used the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion for fault
stability. Their model showed that the water flooding method may induce seismic events
in historically aseismic regions and increase the magnitude of natural earthquakes in
tectonically active regions.
As noted by Nicholson and Wesson (1992), ), in each of the well-documented examples of
injection induced seismicity, there were three common characteristics; first, there was a
close geological connection between the fluid injection zones and the earthquake locations;
second, the measured or inferred in-situ stress and the measured pore pressure pointed
out that the frictional strength along the favorably oriented pre-existing faults was sur-
passed; and third, there was a clear difference between any previous seismic history and



4 Chapter 1. Introduction

the induced earthquakes, which are often characterized by swarms of small shallow earth-
quakes lasting as long as the elevated pore pressures exists. It is now well understood that
injection-induced seismicity is caused by the pore pressure increase allowing the inferred
stresses in the Earth’s crust to overcome the threshold for frictional sliding along favor-
ably oriented pre-existing faults (Nicholson and Wesson, 1992). Since the shear stresses
in the poroelastic constitutive relations (Detournay, 1993), are not affected by the pore
pressure, it is usually assumed that the pre-existing shear stress is the main driving force
for fault slip caused by the shear strength reduction due to the increased pore pressure.

Extraction induced seismicity

Triggered or induced earthquakes, which spatially correlate with areas of massive fluid
withdrawal, can be classified into two rather broad categories (Nicholson and Wesson,
1992): (1) shallow and (2) deep induced earthquakes. The former occur near or within
the producing zone and exhibit, in general, normal or reverse faulting focal mechanisms
(studied in this work). They can be linked to the rapid subsidence and poroelastic strain
changes due to the extraction of large volumes of fluid (Segall, 1987). The latter occur
near the seismogenic zone base, often show signs of thrust focal mechanism and may
be related to stress and/or strain changes due to the unloading effects of the removal
of large amounts of fluid from the area undergoing crustal convergence. They are more
ambiguous and much larger in magnitude than shallow induced earthquakes, and are
much more difficult to separate from the background seismicity.
The first well documented example of shallow induced seismicity correlated with hydro-
carbon extraction was probably given by Pratt (1926). In the Goose Creek oil field, in
Galveston Bay, south Texas, production began in 1917 at depths ranging from 300 m to
1200 m, and by 1925, there was recorded surface subsidence by as much as 1 m centring
over the producing field. Subsidence was accompanied by small earthquakes, and several
normal faults developed along the field margins breaking the ground. Since then, in many
other cases around the world, it has been possible to identify seismicity correlated with
fluid withdrawal.
Probably, the most studied example of extraction-induced seismicity is that of the Lacq
gas field where seismic events have been monitored for more than 25 years (Feignier, 1990;
Grasso, 1992; Guyoton and Volant, 1992; Segall, 1994; Lahaie and Boyer, 1998). Since the
onset of production in 1957, 220109 m3 of gas had been produced by 1995 and the reservoir
pressure progressively declined from 66 MPa to 35 MPa in 1969 to 16 MPa in 1987 to 7.5
MPa in 1995 at 3700 m depth. The first seismic event was recorded in 1969, roughly 10
years after the gas exploitation started. Since 1974, when the local seismological network
was deployed, more than 1000 seismic events with the largest magnitude (M = 4.2) in
1978 have been recorded in a historically aseismic region. More than 90 percent of the



1.2. Literature review 5

epicentres were located in the hydrocarbon field. Surface subsidence of about 60 mm has
been observed over the 40 years of gas production in Lacq field.

Segall (1987) suggested that the poroelastic stressing of the reservoir and surrounding
rocks, associated with volumetric contraction of the reservoir material, is responsible for
the induced seismicity associated with fluid extraction. He suggested a mechanism of
surface deformation and faulting associated with fluid extraction. Pore fluid withdrawal
causes reduction in the pore pressure within the reservoir, triggering adjustments of the
geological structures to perturbations related to the reservoir response to depletion. Ac-
cording to Segall (1987), poroelastic mechanisms transfer this stress change from the
reservoir rock to its surroundings where seismic instabilities occur either above or below
the reservoir if the faults are sufficiently pre-stressed.

Existing models of depleting hydrocarbon reservoirs

The increasing number of such cases initiated great interest in studying mechanics of
fault reactivation, ground subsidence, reservoir deformation, and in-situ stress changes
caused by fluid withdrawal e.g. (Geertsma, 1966; Segall, 1987; Teufel, 1991; Morita, 1992;
Grasso, 1992; Rudnicki, 1999; Hawkes, 2009). In this section, existing models of depleting
hydrocarbon reservoirs are reviewed. In most cases, the reservoir has been treated as a
(partially) drained poroelastic inclusion surrounded by an elastic host material. Addi-
tionally, with conventional numerical modeling (Kosloff and Scott, 1980; Maillot, 1999;
Roest, 1994; Ferronato, 2008), usually two approaches are implemented: (1) the reservoir
is modeled as an inclusion with the same material properties as the matrix but with a
different pore pressure (Geertsma, 1966; Segall, 1987, 1992, 1994); (2) the reservoir is
modeled as a uniformly pressurized homogeneous ellipsoidal inclusion with properties dif-
ferent compared to the surrounding rock (Addis, 1998; Rudnicki, 1999). Figure 1.1 shows
a schematic representation of poroelastic inclusion representing the depleted reservoir ?P
and induced stress changes in side burden rocks that can reactivate part of the pre-existent
faults (green lines).

Models based on homogeneous formation

The first approach is based on the works by Geertsma (1966) and Segall (1987), who
investigated the subsidence caused by oil-reservoir depletion based on elastic continuum

mechanics. Geertsma (1966) treated an isolated volume of reduced pore pressure in a
poroelastic half-space with a traction-free surface. He considered a disc-shaped, producing
reservoir separated from its fluid-saturated, semi-infinite surroundings by an impermeable
barrier. He assumed that the pore pressure distribution is independent of the displacement
field and that the pore pressure can be determined by the uncoupled diffusion equation
or that it is prescribed from measurements at a given time. Further, assuming that the
reservoir and surrounding materials are homogeneous and have the same deformation
properties, he analyzed the corresponding poroelastic problem using the concept of strain
nucleus in the half-space, as it was introduced in the theory of thermoelasticity. He then
computed the subsidence above the disc-shaped reservoir by integrating the nucleus solu-
tion (which, essentially, is a Green’s function) over the entire reservoir volume. Although,
Geertsma (1966) did not apply his model to induced seismicity, he was able to arrive
at the important conclusion that the displacement field and subsidence are the result of
shrinkage or compaction of the reservoir, which in turn depends upon the reservoir pres-
sure reduction, height of productive interval, rock compressibility, as well as the depth of
burial and the lateral extent of the reservoir.
Based on the theory of poroelasticity (Biot, 1941; Rice, 1976; Detournay, 1993; Segall,
1987) developed a model for computing poroelastic stress changes due to fluid extraction
for general axisymmetric reservoir geometries and recovered the results of Geertsma (1966)
for a thin disk reservoir with the uniform pressure decrease as a special case. As Geertsma
(1966), rather than solving for pore pressure distribution, he assumed the pressure within
the reservoir is known from the field measurements and reservoir simulations. He further
assumed that the hydraulic diffusivity of the rocks surrounding the reservoir was suffi-
ciently low so that the deformation outside the reservoir was not drained. However, he
did consider the mechanical coupling between the stress and pore pressure and calculated
the undrained pore pressure changes outside the reservoir (i.e., ignoring changes in the
fluid content).
Geertsma (1966) and Segall (1987) also assumed that the producing reservoir has the same
elastic properties as the surrounding material to which it is perfectly bonded. He derived
Green’s functions equivalent to Geertsma (1966) approach for a radial pressure source (or
sink). Using these Green’s functions that are essentially identical to those appearing in
similar thermoelastic problems, he was able to model flat reservoirs with arbitrary radial
pressure distributions. Modeling Lacq gas field in France, Segall (1992) calculated the
poroelastic stresses resulting from production generated decreases in pore pressure and
suggested that these perturbed stresses are responsible for earthquakes associated with
fluid extraction. However, his calculations showed that the perturbing stresses are only
0.01 MPa, which is at least an order of magnitude smaller than typical stress decrease
(0.1 - 10 MPa) associated with earthquakes in nature. Therefore, he concluded that



8 Chapter 1. Introduction

extraction of fluids in Lacq gas field destabilized only those faults that are already near
the frictional instability limit, i.e. shear stresses are near to overcome the frictional
strength existing on fault planes. Though the stress changes he computed were very
small, he did make a comment that steep pressure gradients in pore pressure could lead
to local stress concentrations.
the models of Geertsma (1966), Segall (1987) and after Segall (1992) were aimed at
accounting for the main reason for stress redistribution around depleted reservoir: the
change in reservoir pore pressure. Not only did they consider the stress changes within
the reservoir but also in its surrounding material. After that, Segall (1992) also used
his model to analyze the onset of fault instability. Both models assumed the elastic
properties of the reservoir to be identical to those of the surrounding material. The fact
that the material is homogeneous allowed Geertsma (1966) to consider the interaction
between the reservoir and the Earth’s surface via employing the model of a half-space.
Furthermore, because the solution was based on the corresponding Green’s function for
the homogeneous half-space, it was possible to study non-uniform pressure distributions
and non-planar reservoirs (Segall, 1992). Even though, in general, the approach requires
numerical computing of improper integrals, it is still analytical by nature and allows for
a relatively simple analysis of rather geologically complex cases as, for example Grasso
(1992), Hawkes (2009).

Models based on ellipsoidal inhomogeneity

The second approach, by Addis (1998) and Rudnicki (1999), allows for consideration
of the additional factor of material heterogeneity, i.e., the difference in the properties
between the reservoir and surrounding rocks. Their approach is based on Eschelby’s
work (Eshelby, 1957) on ellipsoidal inhomogeneity. Addis (1998) and Rudnicki (1999)
considered the reservoir to be represented by an ellipsoidal inclusion and the overburden
by the host material. Both the reservoir and the overburden were considered homogeneous
isotropic poroelastic materials with the properties of the inclusion being different from
those of the surrounding material.
The inhomogeneity was assumed to be embedded in an infinite medium. This corresponds
to the reservoir for which the depth from the surface is greater than its lateral extent
(Rudnicki, 1999). Accordingly, both Addis (1998) and Rudnicki (1999) did not account
for the interaction of the depleting reservoir with the free surface. The inhomogeneity
or inclusion was assumed to be hydraulically isolated so that its pore pressure could
differ from the surrounding material. They also assumed that the reservoir is relatively
permeable and conductive so that it has a uniform distribution of pore pressure. Finally,
they assumed that no pressure change occurs outside the reservoir or, in other words,
they assumed drained deformation of the surrounding rock.



1.2. Literature review 9

Modelling the reservoir with a homogeneous ellipsoidal inclusion, with different elastic
properties and a pore pressure uniform throughout the reservoir (Mura, 1982), allowed
Addis (1998) and Rudnicki (1999) to study the effect of various ellipsoidal geometries and
property mismatch on alterations of the local stress state inside the reservoir caused by
the pore pressure changes. Addis (1998) considered a large flat oblate horizontal reservoir
(that is, in the extreme of the infinitesimal aspect ratio) and concluded that the stress-
depletion response inside the reservoir decreases with increasing magnitude of Poisson’s
ratio and decreasing value of Biot’s poroelastic parameter of the reservoir material and
that the moduli of the reservoir and surrounding rocks have little influence on the stress
response inside the reservoir.
Rudnicki (1999) also considered an axisymmetric inhomogeneity, but, in addition to the
effect of Poisson’s ratio and the shear modulus, he also studied the influence of the aspect
ratio of the reservoir on the stress depletion response inside the reservoir. He concluded
that as the shape of the reservoir becomes flatter (tending in the limit towards a layered
geometry), the axial stress perturbation approaches zero, but the approach is slower for
smaller values of Poisson’s ratio and the shear modulus of the reservoir material. Further,
the strain perturbation within the reservoir approaches to the uniaxial model with the
decreasing aspect ratio of the reservoir, but the approach is slower if the shear modulus of
the inhomogeneity exceeds that of the surrounding material. In the limit of the infinitesi-
mal aspect ratio, the effect of contrast in the shear modulus becomes insignificant on both
the axial and lateral stress perturbations inside the reservoir. However, the influence of
Poisson’s ratio becomes insignificant only in the case of axial stress perturbation while
the lateral stress perturbation can differ by a few times. Rudnicki (1999) further used the
calculated stress paths to evaluate whether the stress state is going towards or away from
failure on faults within the reservoir.
Segall (1994) also used the inclusion method proposed by Eshelby (1957) to compute the
stress changes occurring within hydrocarbon reservoirs, but considered the properties of
the reservoir material to be same as the surrounding material. Their analysis showed
that if the regional stress is extensional (i.e., normal faulting stress regime), the Biot’s
coefficient is greater than 0.85, Poisson’s ratio is 0.20, the reservoir aspect ratio is 1/26,
and the coefficient of friction is smaller than 0.5, then normal faulting is promoted within
the reservoir itself due to its depletion. Regardless of these conditions, dilatant fracturing
and normal faulting are always stimulated near the edges of the reservoir or near the
regions of high-pore pressure gradients at the boundary. In the compressional regional
stress environment (i.e., reverse faulting stress regime), reverse faulting is stimulated
above and below the level of the reservoir due to reservoir depletion.
Since Addis (1998) and Rudnicki (1999) focused on the stress-depletion response within
the reservoir, they did not evaluate the poroelastic deformation and possible fault reac-

tivation outside the reservoir. Nevertheless, although in their model, the reservoir pore
pressure was assumed to be uniform throughout and, therefore, they could not analyze the
depletion strategies associated with non-uniform distributions of reservoir pore pressure,
their work demonstrated that indeed, material inhomogeneity is an important factor (in
addition to the changes in the reservoir pore pressure).

1.2.3 Continuous Galerkin (CG) method

In terms of geomechanical modeling many techniques have been developed in order to
simulate physical processes such as stress/strain behavior, fluid flow, heat transfer and
dynamic loading in complex situations. They are often used to estimate the effects of
mining activities on stress/strain behavior of rocks and environmental issues. Many tech-
niques have been developed such as the finite element, finite difference, discrete element,
distinct element (Rejeb, 1996) and boundary element methods. For this work the finite
element method is chosen and implemented in a C++ code called LPA (Linear Poroelas-
tic Analysis), in order to provide a non-commercial option to study the fault reactivation
issues by means of linear poroelasticity.
The most popular numerical techniques for solving poromechanics problems are the con-
tinuous Galerkin (CG) finite element methods. The first application of the CG finite
element methods to model the flow of compressible fluid in porous elastic media be-
gan in 1969 by Wilson (1973). Their finite element formulation was based on Gurtin’s
variational principle (Gurtin, 1964) and applied to three-dimensional soil consolidation
problems. The stability of the CG methods was first briefly commented on Wilson (1973).
He pointed out that a very small time step resulted in oscillatory pressure for problems
with low permeability. However, he didn’t present his unstable results obtained with
small time steps. The earliest appropriate use of finite element spaces for consolidation
problems is attributed to Hwang (1971). In his numerical study on plane strain consoli-
dation problems, a six node triangle was used to represent a quadratic displacement field
and a three node triangle was selected to represent a linear pore pressure field. These
proposed finite element spaces happened to represent a stable scheme, which satisfies the
Ladyzhenskaya-Babuska-Brezzi (LBB) inf-sup condition (Brezzi, 1991). However, this
scheme is not popular in practical applications due to the constraint on approximation
spaces which requires complex programming. However using the NeoPZ environment,
arbitrary approximation orders can be used for pressure and displacement, consequently
LBB condition is easily satisfied. Vermeer and Verruijt (1981) were the first who demon-
strated nonphysical pressure oscillations in continuous Galerkin (CG) finite element so-
lutions, which are induced by using small time steps. Their stability analysis was based
on a 1-D problem. They showed that there is a lower bound for the time step, dependent

on the order of the finite elements employed, below which spatial oscillations in pressure
will occur. A few techniques have been proposed to remove the oscillation in pressure
solution obtained by the popular CG methods. An obvious technique is to use a fine mesh
or a high order element near the boundary. Indeed, this method can help to alleviate the
oscillation. But it is not able to completely remove the oscillation until an extremely fine
mesh is used, which is not practical. Sandhu (1977) proposed to use singular elements near
the loaded surface. However, the appropriate polynomial order of singular elements could
exceed 60 degrees, which could be difficult for computer implementations. In fact these
oscillations do not only depend on the LBB condition. They occur for any approximation
of parabolic problems. An intensive search for an appropriate stabilizing parameter is re-
quired for this stabilized CG method. Since the (LBB) condition is satisfied, it is easy to
show that no considerable oscillations in pressure occur in comparison with cheap linear-
linear elements; thus a reasonable approximation can be obtained using cubic-quadratic
or high order elements for displacement and pressure chosen as state variables.

1.3 Research objectives
The main objective of the research presented in this dissertation is to understand the
fundamental mechanisms of fault reactivation induced by oil production using 2D ge-
omechanical modelling of oil reservoirs, as well as to develop the corresponding quan-
titative numerical implementation. Ideally, any model intended to simulate a physical
phenomenon should be calibrated against the real data for practical implementation but
this is left for future works. Therefore, the suggested implementation is a simple and ro-
bust platform to generate numerical models, that would allow to do parametric analysis
and identify the critical issues related to induced reservoir fault reactivation caused by
hydrocarbon production, following the next specific objectives:

• To understand fundamental mechanisms of fault reactivation due to reservoir de-
pletion by means of poroelastic effects.

• To develop a simple, robust, and quantitative numerical model for the depletion of
a hydrocarbon reservoir.

• To account for both non-uniform pressure distribution within the reservoir and
material contrast between reservoir and surrounding rocks.

• To analyze the onset of fault instability caused by the perturbation a known initial
stress state.

• To identify the important parameters affecting the fault stability.



12 Chapter 1. Introduction

The study focuses on the influence of several geomechanical parameters on stress develop-
ment and fault slip in and around an arbitrary-shaped oil reservoir intersected or not by
a normal or reverse faults that are represented with potential slip surfaces in continuous
poroelastic media. Attention is given to the development, implementation and quantifi-
cation methods. Wich include arching, normal, shear stress and fault reactivation factor
along faults plane. Parameters include reservoir geometry, reservoir size, depth, tilt angle,
reservoir shape and surrounding rock properties.
As discussed in the previous section, the existing models based on the approach of a ho-
mogeneous formation accounted for the principal reason of stress redistribution around
depleted reservoirs, i.e. a change in reservoir pore pressure, while those utilizing the
approach of ellipsoidal inclusion accounted for another important factor of material in-
homogeneity, but considered uniform pressure distribution inside the reservoir. The next
natural step is to account for both the non-uniform reservoir pressure and the material
inhomogeneity in the model by using this numerical approach.

1.4 Outline of dissertation
A theoretical review of the constitutive equations for mono-phasic poroelastic model is
given in Chapter 2. Main assumptions made in the model are discussed. A dimension-
less form of the strong formulation is presented in Chapter 2. Also theoretical concepts
and a mathematical description of semi-analytical method for fault reactivation using
inclusion theory are provided in chapter 2. Through 3, the weak statement and finite
element continuous Galerkin formulation is presented. The corresponding computational
implementation and validation with some analytical solutions is presented in Chapter
4. Finally fault reactivation tendency caused by the reservoir depletion is analyzed and
numerical comparison with STARS Simulator for reservoir geomechanics calculations is
given in Chapter 5. The effect of different depletion strategies (e.g., various pressure dis-
tributions) as well as of the reservoir rigidity on the onset of fault reactivation are studied.
Chapter 6 summarizes results and conclusions obtained in this work and provides some
recommendations for future research.



2. Theoretical concepts

2.1 Small deformations in porous media

With the current progress in the mechanics of porous media and non-linear finite element
analysis, a finite deformation analysis of coupled problem can be established directly.
However, it is still necessary to establish a separate small deformation formulation for
comparison and modeling purposes. First, for some simple cases, it is possible to find
analytical solutions under the small deformation assumption. The analytical solutions
can be used in the validation of the small deformation analysis, as well as in the finite
deformation analysis at small strains. Under the finite deformation assumption, it is more
difficult (in most cases impossible) to find an analytical solution. Thus, the small defor-
mation analysis provides a good comparison to the finite deformation analysis. Second,
the results from the small deformation analysis are usually accurate enough in the small
deformation regime, and the amount of computer time required in the small deformation
analysis is much less than that of the finite deformation analysis. Thus the small defor-
mation approach is still acceptable and even preferable for engineering problems at small
strains. Although the response of near surface earth materials is seldom precisely linear,
the theory of linear fluid infiltrated elastic solids has proven to be very useful in studying a
variety of geotechnical and geophysical problems. These include soil consolidation (Biot,
1941), hydraulic fracture (Cleary, 1979), and various aspects of earth faulting (Booker,
1974; Rudnicki, 1986).
Even in the small strain regime, there are a number of ways to investigate the transient
response of fluid saturated porous media subject to external loading. The problem can
be simplified under different assumptions. In some cases, when the permeability of the
saturated rock is very small or large, the problem may be simplified by assuming undrained
or drained condition. Usually, the undrained condition assumption is valid if the rate of
loading is much higher than the diffusion of pore fluid. In this case, very little amount
of pore fluid can escape in transient process, the mass content of fluid in each material
element remains essentially constant, and there is no relative displacement between the
fluid phase and the solid skeleton. On the other hand, if the loading rate is much smaller

13



14 Chapter 2. Theoretical concepts

than the diffusion rate of the pore fluid, the pore pressure in each material element can
be assumed to remain constant at its hydrostatic level, and does not vary with the solid
skeleton deformation.
The most direct formulation of governing equations for a linear poroelastic solid were
established by Biot (1941), other formulations have been given by Bear (1972), Rice
(1976), Cleary (1977), Rudnicki (1986) and Wang (2000). A treatment of the equations
based on those works is presented in this section.

2.2 Poroelastic formulation

2.2.1 Main assumptions

The most common and general cases in reality are intermediate. Generally an interaction
exists between the solid phase and the fluid phase. The pore fluid flows out during
loading, the pore fluid pressure varies with time. To analyze these cases, a mono-phasic
continuum model must be formulated to incorporate the effect of the transient flow of the
fluid through the porous media.
The following assumptions are introduced in this analysis:

• No inertial effects, i.e. a quasi-static deformation process.

• Small deformation regime.

• Isothermal flow.

• The flow is governed by diffusive mass flux.

• Full saturated isotropic solid.

• The permeability tensor is diagonal.

• Compressible rock formation. Fluid flow is characterized by Darcy’s law (a thorough
study of Darcy’s law is given for Bear (1972)). Some assumptions are intrinsically
related to Darcy’s law:

• Fluid phase is homogeneous and Newtonian.

• No chemical reaction, precipitation or adsorption occurs.

• There is no electro-kinetic effect.



2.2. Poroelastic formulation 15

Used sign convention
The sign convention used in this work conforms to the continuum mechanics convention:
Tension stress is defined as a positive field.

State variables
For the small deformation analysis, the state of saturated porous media can be fully
expressed in the following variables:

• Excess pore pressure, Pex;

• The average displacement of the solid phase, u;

The mass conservation equations of the solid and fluid phases are derived. An arbitrary
volume Vvol containing solid and fluid phases is considered. Assuming a fully saturated
solid, then the volume occupied by the fluid phase (i.e. f suffix for fluid phase) is ?Vvol.
Let ?f , ?solid represent the mass density of fluid and solid phase of a continuum, respec-
tively. The total mass of fluid contained in arbitrary volume Vvol can be written as

mf =
?
Vvol

?f?dVvolume (2.1)

while the total mass of solid contained in the same volume is

msolid =
?
Vvol

?solid (1 ??) dVvolume (2.2)

The balance of mass for the fluid phase gives

dmf

Where vf is the interstitial phase velocity. The balance of mass for the solid phase gives

With Vvol being arbitrary, the last two equations using the localization theorem given in
Gurtin (1981) take the following localized form:
for the fluid phase

+ ?· (?f?vf ) = 0 (2.5)



16 Chapter 2. Theoretical concepts

for the solid phase

? (?solid (1 ??))
?t

+ ?· (?solid (1 ??) vsolid) = 0 (2.6)

2.2.2 Fluid potential and excess pore pressure

In earth sciences e.g. reservoir engineering, geology and hydrology, fluid potential at a
point is defined as the work required by frictionless process to transport a unit mass of
fluid from a state of atmospheric pressure to zero elevation or absolute datum to the point
in question D i.e. D = Zdatum ?Z. Mathematically the definition of Hubbert ?H fluid
potential for any fluid (valid for compressible and incompressible fluid Ertekin (2001)) is:

?H =
? P
Pdatum

1
? (P)

dP ?D (2.7)

The potential gradient is obtained from (2.7)

??H = ?
(? P

Pref

? (P)

dP ?D
)

=

?
?(P ?D) (2.8)

multiplying the ??H by ?, the conventional form of the fluid potential is found

?? = ???H = ?(P ??f g D) (2.9)

where ? (P) = ?f (P) g is the fluid density in terms of pressure per distance usually called
fluid gravity.
In geomechanics a typical problem is to find fluid pore pressure and displacement response
due to applied load or to fluid extraction Wang (2000). If the fluid is static in the initial
state, it is possible to decompose the total pressure into the sum of hydrostatic pressure
and an excess pore pressure Pex (figure 2.1). Excess pore pressure is the total pore
pressure minus hydrostatic pressure. Thus Pex is analogue to fluid potential and can be
expressed as:

Pex = P ??D (2.10)

hydrostatic pressure. Source: redraw from Wang (2000).

2.2.3 Darcy’s law

Darcy’s law is an empirical relationship between the flow rate through a porous medium
and the potential gradient. The Darcy average velocity of fluid phase v?f is given as:

v?f = ?
?

?
?? = ?

?

?
?Pex (2.11)

v?mf = qf = ??f
?

?
?? = ??f

?

?
?Pex (2.12)

while v?f is the Darcy velocity, ? is a diagonal absolute permeability tensor.
Darcy’s law can be considered an empirical or analytical expression derived from the
Navier Stokes equation (e.g. derivation is presented on Bear (1972)). In either case, it is
still the cornerstone of the contemporary reservoir simulation.
It is important to point out that the mass balance in the petroleum industry really are
the volume conservation equations written in terms of volumetric volume factors of each
phase; the basis for this mass balance is the volume of each phase at stock-tank conditions.
Once the stock tank conditions are specified, the volume balance of the oil, water and gas



18 Chapter 2. Theoretical concepts

may be converted through the phase densities at stock-tank conditions. Taking the fact
that Darcy law describes flow with respect to the solid matrix Biot (1941), the macroscopic
Darcy velocity can be written as:

v?f = ? (vf ? vsolid)
?vf = v?f + ?vsolid

(2.13)

Substituting this in the mass balance equation 2.5 for v?f

? (??f )
?t

= ??· (?fv?f ) ??· (??fvsolid) + qf (2.14)

in terms of v?mf , the continuity equation became:

? (??f )
?t

= ??· (v?mf ) ??· (?fvsolid) + qf (2.15)

The coupling term in a poroelastic simulation are ? and vs, they account for the effect of
solid deformation on flows. A conventional reservoir simulation is based on the fact that
rock deforms very slowly compared to multiphase flow, i.e. in equation 2.13 vsolid ? v?f
so v?f = ?vf .
Applying the chain rule over equations 2.15 and 2.6:

?(??f )
?t

+ ?· (v?mf ) + vsolid ·?(??f ) + ??f?· vsolid = qf (2.16)

?((1 ??)?solid)
?t

applying the definition of Lagrangian’s total derivative with respect to a moving solid:

Equations can be written as:

where ?? is the so called fluid fraction and is defined as

?? = ? (1 + ?v) (2.29)



20 Chapter 2. Theoretical concepts

for a poroelastic material with small deformation regime, the total bulk volume Vbulk can
be approximated by a linear function of ?v as Vbulk = V ?bulk (1 + ?v) and taking into account
this approximation in equation 2.29. The fluid fraction or fluid mass content (Rudnicki,
1986) ?? can be viewed as the system “porosity” relative to the initial under-formed bulk
volume V ?bulk i.e.

?? = ?
Vbulk
V ?bulk

=
Vporous
V ?bulk

(2.30)

Non-deformable porous media or the initial state of deformable porous media implies that
the fluid fraction ?? is equal to the true porosity ?. However in an uncoupled reservoir
model, the contribution of total stress to the fluid fractions is always approximated by
the linear function of pore pressure

?? = ? (1 + Cr (Pex ?Pex? )) (2.31)

with Cr as rock compressibility.
According to Geertsma (1957), the relative porosity variation in a deformed medium is
approximated by

d?

?

(d?? + dPex) (2.32)

where ?? = 3?+2µ3 ?v ? ?P
ex is the mean stress, Kb and Ks are respectively the bulk

modulus of solid matrix and solid constituents. The Biot’s coefficient ? (Biot, 1941) can
be measured independently in a jacketed drained test and is associated with Kb and Ks
by the following relationship

? =
(

1 ?

)
(2.33)

If small strain modelling is assumed the porosity ? can be approximated from equation

by using ?? = ? (1 + ?v) or ? = ?

(1+?v)
, it becomes

?? = ?? + (Cb ? (1 + ??) Cs) Pex + (Cb ?Cs) ?? (2.35)

or in terms of ? and Pex

?? = ?? + ??v +

M
Pex (2.36)



2.2. Poroelastic formulation 21

where the M is Biot’s constant defined as

1
M

= (1 ??) (????)Cb (2.37)

Cb and Cs are respectively the bulk compressibility and solid grain compressibility, they
are related to Kb and Ks by

Cb = 1Kb
Cs = 1Ks

(2.38)

if M &gt; 0 ? lies within the following bounds

?? ? ? ? 1 (2.39)

if the solid material is incompressible, Cs = 0 and ? = 1 or ? = ?? then 1M = 0. Finally,
a low advective velocity is imposed on the coupled mass balance equation

?(???f)
?t

?
vsolid ·?(???f ), that is

D(???f )
Dt

?
?(???f )
?t

(2.40)

The physical interpretation of this approximation is that the medium is undergoing de-
formation but remains stationary. Thus the multiphase flow equation 2.28 coupled with
geomechanics can finally be written as

?(?f
(
?? + ??· u + 1M P

ex
)
)

?t
+ ?· v?mf = qf (2.41)

with ?? replaced by equation 2.36. However, in rock mechanics analysis, it is standard to
write the coupled equations in terms of total stress and excess pore pressure as

??
?(?f )
?t

+ ?f (Cb ? (1 + ??) Cs)
?(Pex)
?t

+ ?f (Cb ?Cs)
?(??)
?t

+ ?· v?mf = qf (2.42)

The above derivation is based on volume variations, including bulk volume, pore volume
and porosity variations. As a result, displacements or stresses explicitly show up in the
continuity equations.
Another term that implicitly involves geomechanical effect is the transmissibility term (?·
v?f ) through permeability changes, although rock permeability is generally considered to
remain constant in standard reservoir simulations. Permeability-stress coupling, however,
is not a direct coupling as in pore volume. It is usually conducted in a stepped manner.
One simple approach is to assume that permeability depends on porosity as, for example,
according to the Garman-Kozeny relation commonly used in basin simulators. Other



22 Chapter 2. Theoretical concepts

stress-dependent permeability models may also be used, e.g. Morita (1992). Here, it is
pointed out that pore volume coupling is the primary interest of this work. Permeability-
stress coupling and non-linear relations of fluid properties by dependence of pressure are
proposed as future works.
In summary the mathematical description for coupling porous flow and geomechanics must
account for the following important characteristics of the reservoir system (Osorio, 1992):

1. The multi-component nature of the reservoirs require descriptions for both the pore
pressure of fluids and the solid components, so mass and force conservation laws
and constitutive relations, which represent the coupling effects must be combined
to obtain the fully coupled equations.

2. Pressure depletion, which occurs inside the reservoir induces an extended stress-
disturbed region outside the reservoir boundaries. The disturbed region affects the
evolution of the stress at the reservoir boundaries. The geomechanical interaction
between boundaries and stress state inside the reservoir is a fully coupled process.
This indicates that the inclusion of a surrounding environment (over burden, under
burden and side burden) is necessary to achieve a realistic modeling of the actual
geomechanical boundary conditions. Indeed the surrounding domain needs to be
extensive enough to ensure that its boundaries are not perturbed by reservoir pro-
duction or injections during the time period of interest.

2.2.4 Strong formulation
Returning to the formulation, the coupled mass balance and force equations are written
as:

?
?t

(?f (?? + ? (?· u ??· u?) + S? (Pex ?Pex? ))) + ?·?fv?f = qf (2.43)

where S? = 1M , and

The system is complete with equilibrium equation and linear elastic constitutive behavior:

(2.47)

The mono-phasic flow at reservoir conditions for compressible solid and fluid constituents
is given by taking the divergence of linear constitutive equation 2.46. Thus the system
becomes:

with the corresponding boundary conditions.
Let ? be the physical domain and ?? the boundary of ?. It can be separated into
??diffusion and ??elasticity:

??elasticity = ??u + ???t
??diffusion = ??pex + ??q

(2.50)

where ??u is the displacement boundary, ???t is the total stress or traction boundary, ??P
is the excess pore pressure boundary, and ??q is the fluid flux boundary. The displacement
boundary condition is

u = u on ??u (2.51)
where u is the prescribed displacement on surface. The total stress or traction boundary
condition on ???t is:

?t · n = t on ???t (2.52)

In this section dimensionless forms of poroelasticity are presented to exploit and obtain
more general results in the following sections.

Dimensionless Analysis by Using the Pi Theorem

The Buckingham ? theorem is key in dimensional analysis. It is the formalization of
Rayleigh’s method of dimensional analysis. The theorem states that if we have a physi-
cally meaningful equation involving a certain number n of physical variables, and these
variables are expressible in terms of k independent fundamental physical quantities, then
the original expression is equivalent to an equation involving a set of r = n ? k dimen-
sionless parameters constructed from the original variables: rewriting the equations in a
non-dimensional form. It provides a method for computing sets of dimensionless parame-
ters from the given variables, even if the form of the equation is still unknown. However,
the choice of dimensionless parameters is not unique, Buckingham’s theorem only pro-
vides a way of generating sets of dimensionless parameters, and will not choose the most
physically meaningful set (Wong, 1990). Combined with inspection analysis this proce-
dure allows the choice of important quantities that represent the fundamental behavior
of one phenomenon.
Using the procedure in Wong (1990), the poroelastic coupled system described by (2.48)
with boundary and initial conditions: (2.51), (2.52), (2.53), (2.54), (2.55), are transformed

There are a variety of dimensionless numbers published in petroleum literature and, based
on the flow system, they can be divided in two groups: single-phase and two-phase sys-
tems. Normally, single-phase systems are used in well test analysis where inspection
analysis enables the transformation into dimensionless space for any given set of given
boundary conditions. For two-phase systems, Lake (1990) presents a general method to
scale flow through heterogeneous permeable media for an immiscible displacement of oil
by water in a two-dimensional, anisotropic, heterogeneous cross section with statistically
stationary properties. Gharbi (2002) established a foundation for scaling miscible dis-
placement in three-dimensional reservoirs. These examples illustrate how dimensional
forms allow the understanding of essential mechanisms and present the results in a com-
pact form.

2.3 Fault Reactivation according to the inclusion the-
ory

Geological discontinuities such as faults are inherent in most petroleum formations. There
are a number of human activities, such as hydrocarbon production, that can sufficiently



2.3. Fault Reactivation according to the inclusion theory 27

alter the in-situ stresses within a period of a few years or even a few months resulting
in reactivation and slip of the nearby faults (Hawkes, 2009). Fault reactivation due to
reservoir depletion may have various consequences ranging from shearing boreholes drilled
to inducing seismicity on faulted zones. Stress state perturbation resulting from subsur-
face fluid extraction clearly and robustly demonstrates the importance of considering the
poroelastic effect. The increasing number of induced seismicity and well damages initiated
great interest in studying the mechanics of fault reactivation, ground subsidence, reservoir
deformation, and in-situ stress changes caused by fluid withdrawal (Germanovich, 2004).
In most cases the reservoir has been treated as a partially drained poroelastic inclusion
surrounded by an elastic host material. Usually to solve this problem in the literature,
three approaches can be considered:

1. The reservoir is modelled by an inclusion with a rather arbitrary pore pressure
distribution but with the same material properties as the surrounding rock matrix.

2. The reservoir is modelled as a uniformly pressurized homogeneous ellipsoidal inclu-
sion with different material properties compared to the surrounding rock.

3. Numerical approximations as: finite difference, finite elements, or boundary ele-
ments procedures, are used to model the phenomenon.

The first approach is based on a homogeneous formation and accounts for the main reason
for stress redistribution around depleted reservoirs, i.e., a change in the reservoir pore
pressure. The second approach, utilizing an ellipsoidal inclusion, accounts for another
important factor of material inhomogeneity, but considers uniform pressure distribution
inside the reservoir.
The third approach, used in this work, is relatively flexible, but when modeling large
domains with complex geometries, unreliable solutions can be obtained if conventional
numeric techniques are used. In addition, with numerical modeling, it is possible to cal-
culate different material contrast and different production programs. Using the suggested
implementation, the challenge is to obtain a reasonable approximation without extreme
refinements and large simulations times.

2.3.1 Main assumptions

The following simplifying assumptions are made for the semi-analytical approach given
in Hawkes (2009) and Germanovich (2004):

1. Plane strain conditions. This means the third normal stress is expressed as function
of the other ones and pore pressure excess.



28 Chapter 2. Theoretical concepts

2. The reservoir can interact with the earth surface, having the same elastic moduli as
side burden rocks.

3. Side burden rocks are under the drained limit.

4. Linear poroelastic behavior of reservoir and side burden rocks.

5. The initial in-situ stress state is known.

6. Ideal cohesion on the reservoir boundaries.

7. Fault gouge obeys the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion.

8. Thin pre-existing faults. Mechanically, faults don’t exist, they represent potential
slip surfaces.

Note that, before the onset of slip, the presence of the fault does not affect the stress
state around the reservoir. In this respect, mechanically, the fault does not exist before
the slip initiates and only represents a potential slip surface rather than a displacement
discontinuity affecting the state of stress.

2.3.2 Theoretical concepts
An inclusion is defined as a sub-domain ? in domain D, where the arbitrary strains
referred as eigenstrain ?? (x) (Mura, 1982; Hawkes, 2009) is given in ? and is zero in
D??, this strain field can be thought as internal strains that would be caused by different
mechanisms, including poroelastic, poroelastoplastic and thermal changes in a unbounded
body free of external forces and surface constrains. The elastic moduli in ? and D?? are
the same, assumption (2). The remaining domain D ? ? is called the elastic matrix. In
his well-known papers on this subject, Eshelby (1957) showed that the inclusion problem
is equivalent to solving equations of elastic equilibrium for a homogeneous body with a
known body force distribution. For such bodies, the equations of elastic equilibrium are
solved using the elastic static Green functions (Mura, 1982).
The Green function G (x, x?) gives the magnitude of the displacement in the xi direction
at point x when a unit body force in the xj direction is applied at point x? to an elastic
medium under plane strain conditions into half space assumption (1), (2), (3) and (4).
In the Green function method, the displacement u and stress field ? due to eigenstrain
?? (x) in the inclusion is given as:

u =
?
?

Cjlmn?

mn (x

??
? (2.69)

where ?? (x) = 0 for x ? D ? ?, Cjikl = ??ij?kl + µ (?ik?jl + ?il?jk).
Since ?? (x) is discontinuous on the boundary of the inclusion ??, some quantities may
also be discontinuous on the boundary. However the displacement and the inter-facial
tractions across the boundary must be continuous, i.e. assumption (6) that is:

?u?? = uout ? uin (2.70)

???? · n = {?out ??in} · n (2.71)
Eshelby (1957) showed that, for an ellipsoidal inclusion in a full-space, the strain and
stress field are uniform for all interior points. In the case of dilatational eigenstrain (i.e.,
the tendency of the inclusion would be to expand or contract isotropically, as would be
the case for poroelastic or thermoelastic strains in an isotropic medium), ?? (x) = ?C (x) I,
with I representing the identity matrix, thus equations 2.67, 2.68 and 2.69 are reduced
to:

?

?C (x?) GSij (x, x
?) dx? + ?? (x?) (2.74)

where ?? (x) = (2µ + 3?) ?ij?C (x) is the eigenstress at point x, and GDi (x, x?) = Gij,l (x ? x?)
and GSij (x, x?) = µ (Gip,pj (x ? x?) + Gjp,pi (x ? x?)) + ? (Gkp,pk (x ? x?)) ?ij respectively,
are influence and stress functions for dilatation (Segall, 1987; Hawkes, 2009).
It is possible to consider a reservoir as an inclusion if it has the same material properties
as the surrounding rock, and the eigenstrains are defined as the dilatational strains that
would be caused by changes in pore pressure excess ?Pex or temperature ?T inside the
reservoir if it was unbounded. The values of dilatational eigenstrain for these conditions,
respectively, are:

?C (x) =

(2.75)



30 Chapter 2. Theoretical concepts

?C (x) = ??T (x) (2.76)

where Ku is the undrained bulk modulus and ? is the linear coefficient of thermal expan-
sion.
The treatment of a reservoir as an inclusion also requires the assumption that no pressure
or temperature change occurs in the surrounding rocks; i.e., there is no hydraulically
driven flow, no heat transfer, and fully drained loading occurs. Inclusion theory allows
the consideration of reservoirs of arbitrary shape. A useful result of the treatment of
the dimensionless equations is the possibility to use LPA in linear thermal stress calcu-
lations, since in the dimensionless form of poroelastic and thermoelastic equations are
mathematically equal.

2.3.3 Assessment of fault reactivation

Stress arching ratios

The ratio of the change in total stress to the change in pore pressure within the reservoir
has been referred to as the stress arching ratio. Normalized stress arching ratios are
defined by Hawkes (2009) and are slightly more generalized for poroelastic analysis, since
they results from the stresses and homogeneous excess pore pressure change combination,
and are expressed as follows:

? =
??

??Pex
(2.77)

when ? and ?Pex are defined ? is directly determine using 2.77.

Coulomb failure stress change ?CFS

The Coulomb Failure Stress (CFS) is defined as follows :

CFS = ? ?µs?n (2.78)

where ? and ?n respectively are, shear and effective normal stress on the fault plane,
µs is the coefficient of friction in the fault plane (i.e., the tangent of the fault friction
angle normally between 0.4 &amp;lt;µs &amp;lt;0.8 for several brittle rocks (Hawkes, 2009)). A fault
plane is activated when CFS is equal to or greater than zero. In a production or injection
scenario, where in stress changes have been induced, the change in CFS is:

?CFS = ?? ?µs??n (2.79)



2.3. Fault Reactivation according to the inclusion theory 31

The sign of ?? is positive when it points in the same direction as the initial shear stress
on the plane. The sign of ??n is negative for an increase in compressive stress. As such,
a positive ?CFS indicates a tendency towards fault reactivation. Earthquake-induced
?CFS values as small as 0.1 MPa have been found to induce seismic activity in faulted
settings evidencing fault reactivation where initial CFS values are close to zero (Segall,
1992; Guyoton and Volant, 1992; Rudnicki, 1999; Ferronato, 2008; Hawkes, 2009). In
order to achieve a more general, dimensionless characterization of fault reactivation risk,
a parameter called fault reactivation factor Hawkes (2009) is defined here as follows:

?FR =
?CFS
??Pex

=
??

??Pex
?µs

??n
??Pex

=
??shear
??Pex

?µs
??n
??Pex

(2.80)

Fault Reactivation calculations

Following Hawkes (2009), effective stress changes or normalized stress arching ratios can
be calculated as follow:

• Given a ?Pex calculate ? using the equation 2.74.

• Calculate ? and ?FR over a fault plane (straight lines in this work) by applying a
stress rotation over required angles.

• Using the sing of ?FR convention, evaluate which planes are reactivated.

To define fault reactivation calculation, it is necessary to solve the normal and shear stress
or arching ratios along fault plane inclined ? degrees counter-clockwise from x axis, then
calculate ?FR or ?CFS to define the tendency to reactivate. The reactivation is given
for the sign convention in table 2.2

bilization. Left) Used for normalized arching ratios (Hawkes, 2009; Germanovich, 2004).

2.4 Summary

In this chapter, a displacement-pressure (also called u-p formulation) mono phasic and
dimensionless poroelastic formulation was presented. The basic assumptions and consti-
tutive relations of the continuum theory were described. The governing equations consist
of the balance of mass equations and the balance of momentum equations for each phase.
Detailed derivations of these governing equations were presented. The equations finally
became a mono phasic poroelastic system used for subsequent analyses. Also, mathemati-
cal approximation of fault reactivation is given by means of inclusion theory, a formulation
that is going to be used in chapter 5 to compare against LAP calculations.

3.2 Variational formulation

Based on the strong formulation of poroelasticity defined in 2.56, and corresponding initial
and boundary conditions, the weak statement for this work is obtained with the follow
steps:

1. Multiply by admissible members of V for equilibrium equation and W for the mass
conservation equation. These members contract the equations to a scalar.

2. Integrate these equations over all the domain ?.

3. Apply the divergence theorem in order to progressively weaken the smoothness
requirements of the strong solution.

4. Insert the corresponding constitutive equations, in this case the linear elasticity and
Darcy’s law.

5. Finally rewrite the weak statements in terms of the bilinear forms already defined.

But if incompressible constituents are present and diffusion terms do not exist, the com-
pressibility matrix and permeability matrix lead to zero diagonal terms in 3.72, conse-
quently, the matrices to be solved are identical to incompressible elasticity. In such cases,
there are limitations for the approximating functions and the Babuska-Brezzi convergence
condition must be satisfied to avoid non-physical oscillations.
The perturbation problem presented in Figure 1.1 is solved by the system (3.71), where it
is important to point out that stiffness and mass global matrices (3.73) are calculated once
time as well as the solution of the global system. Thus, the iterative process is reduced to
update the global load vector (3.74) as the product between the solution vector at time
n and the global mass matrix, plus the constant load vector representing the mass flux
and the body forces (right term in (3.74)), and finally by multiplying by the inverse of
the stiffness matrix, the solution vector at time n + ? is obtained. This implies that the
time step ?tD is held constant for the entire calculation.

3.6 Summary

The derivation of the weak formulation and its respective continuous Galerkin (CG) form
of poroelastic monophasic flow is presented in terms of bilinear forms, thus the corre-
sponding solution of these equations were described in terms of displacement and excess
pore pressure as state variables of the problem. The discrete form of the equations rep-
resents a set of ordinary differential equations in time. Finite differences were used to
approximate the temporal variable in an implicit matrix and fully coupled formulation
with different time schemes.



4. Implementation and validation

4.1 Implementation

The finite element method was selected to implement the formulation represented by the
matrix systems 3.73 and 3.74. One of its capabilities is modeling complex geometries and
using different polynomial orders to approximate the state variables. However, the use
of this technique represents relative complex challenges from the computational point of
view. This complexity is related to integral calculations, boundary conditions, the need
to use different polynomial orders and different elements types in the same computational
mesh. It is possible to overcome these computational complexities by using object oriented
programming. In object oriented programming, data processing is given by the interaction
of objects that can compute and interchange data to solve one specific problem.
In an object oriented environment, classes represent entities describing data and set of
actions for designing applications and computer programs. When one set of data is
determined, the actions to be executed over this set are determined only under the class
rules. The use of classes is reflected through objects generated from them; thus one object
can be viewed as an independent machine with a distinct role or responsibility. When one
object is generated its actions (or methods) on data are closely associated with it. Thus
instead of programming one set of routines to solve a problem, it is possible to generate
objects that interact between them to solve the same problem.
The cornerstone of object oriented programming is the reuse of classes already developed
and tested in different problems. This favors the quick development of new functionalities
of an existing system to solve another type of problem, since the programmer is focused on
implementing the needed code without thinking about all the possible modifications. It
decreases the possibilities of errors that can alter the normal functionality of the system.
In object oriented environments to solve partial differential equations with finite elements;
matrices, vectors, solvers, nodes, geometric and computational elements are treated as
objects that interact under several rules. This implementation, LPA, was developed using
the NeoPZ environment Devloo (2009) and new classes were implemented to solve the
formulation in question.

46 Chapter 4. Implementation and validation

NeoPZ description

NeoPZ environment is an object oriented C++ library for the development of finite el-
ement programs (Devloo, 2009), maintained by the LabMeC staff at Unicamp and ac-
cessible from Google Code. The main characteristic of the NeoPZ environment is the
strong separation between geometry modelling, definition of the interpolation space and
definition of the variational statement used to approximate the physical problem. This
approach offers user a generic environment where the re-usability of implemented finite
element algorithms is maximized, for instance:

• One dimensional geometric element which uses a mapping in cylindrical coordinates
is implemented . Using this, rings or helicoidal springs can be approximated without
error in the geometrical map.

• Hierarchical shape functions have been defined for the computational elements. Con-
sequently, all finite element approximations using NeoPZ can make use of high order
interpolation functions, independently of the underlying variational statement.

• H-adaptivity has been implemented, both at the level of the geometric and computa-
tional grid. At the computational grid level, compatibility constraints are computed
between elements which have common sides at a different level. As a result, all finite
element models implemented in PZ can use adaptive grids.

• Any new model, represented by some partial differential equation can be introduced
by adding a class derived from the TPZMaterial class. After the variational state-
ment has been implemented, it can be approximated by C0 finite elements of any
interpolation order, using adapted grids if desired.

LPA description

Linear poroelastic analysis LPA is composed of several C++ classes already implemented
in NeoPZ (TPZGeomesh,TPZCompMesh,TPZMultiphysicsElement). In addition, the
class TPZPoroElastic2d was developed to compute the poroelastic contribution based
on the weak statement previously presented as well as others for geometry processing and
analytical functions (TPZReadGIDGrid). The LPA is based on three principal classes
TPZGeomesh, TPZCompMesh and TPZPoroElastic2d, which involve finite element com-
putations. Operations like generation of geometries, matrix and solution calculations are
considered out of these classes, since they are not an essential part of finite elements
procedures.
The main program can be described by several steps as follows:

http://www.labmec.org.br/wiki/index.php
http://code.google.com/p/neopz/


4.1. Implementation 47

• Generate the geometry that represents the description of nodes, elements and ma-
terials identifiers.

• Using the geometric information two computational meshes are created one for
elasticity, another for the diffusion problem.

• Based on these meshes, the Poroelastic mesh (overlapping of diffusive and elastic
domains is generated (see Figure 4.2), by using the class TPZPoroElastic2d.

• Compute the contribution for each computational element and assemble the global
stiffness and load vector

• Do time calculations and print the required data at each time.

TPZGeomesh
The class TPZGeomesh implements a geometric mesh for the NeoPZ environment. It
provides services for description of geometric elements: one, two and three-dimensional
elements can be used. Several classes derived from TPZGeomesh are used to store the
necessary data in the geometric information such as nodes, elements, material identifiers
as well as node coordinates, elements sides and jacobean calculations for isoparametric
elements. All this information is needed to compute global stiffness and load vector arrays.

TPZCompMesh
The class TPZPoroElastic2d defines the interpolation space and the integration over each
element. It has the information required to compute the stiffness and load vector arrays
for each boundary and domain elements. The computational mesh is like a repository of
computational elements, nodes and material objects that define the way the calculations
are done. In this work the class TPZPoroElastic2d controls how to compute the contribu-
tion over each computational element. TPZCompMesh also contains the current solution
of the mesh and an element wise solution vector.

TPZPoroElastic2d
The class TPZPoroElastic2d is the most important in LPA computations because it rep-
resents the mathematical description of the poroelastic problem defined previously, and
in particular it contains one method called contribute that represents the weak statement
and how the poroelastic contributions of each elements are done. Detailed description of
this method is given in the appendix B.1. Algorithms 1, 2, 3 and 4 explain the code lines



48 Chapter 4. Implementation and validation

of contribute method and their relationships with the mathematical expressions developed
in chapter 3.
In TPZPoroElastic2d the element contributions are computed using basis and weight
functions and their corresponding derivatives according to the bilinear forms given in
chapter 3. This basis and weight functions values are provided for the computational
mesh into TPZCompMesh class. Figure 4.1 represents how the element information is
processed between the objects generated by each class.

Multiphysics point of view
The concept of multi-physics simulations into NeoPZ is very different from other known
finite element implementations. Multiphysics meshes and classes have been validated on
approximations using HDiv flux-pressure interaction. In this work, coupled flow through
porous media modeled by linear poroelasticity is validated, contributing to NeoPZ’s mul-
tiphysics branch. In a general form a multiphysic mesh is composed of the information
given in each material domain that represents one specific state variable. Thus it is nec-
essary to define different domains with geometric information to calculate the respective
basis and weight functions presented in the finite element formulations. Figure 4.2 shows



4.1. Implementation 49

how it is possible to define different domains and to compose the poroelastic domain (red
domain) embedded in an elastic matrix with conforming meshes.

Figure 4.2: Embedded domain by overlapping areas. Left) Diffusion domain that contains
all geometric information and computational information for flow calculations, Right)
Elastic domain that contains all geometric information and computational information
for elasticity.

In finite element approximations of systems of partial differential equations, it is cus-
tomary to associate the same weight function to each state variable. For instance, in
two-dimensional elasticity the same weight function is associated with the horizontal and
vertical displacements. In most of finite element approximations, the number of state
variables associated with each shape function is constant. In these cases, the number of
state variables can be a value associated with geometric meshes. In multiphysics prob-
lems, the number of state variables can vary according to the physical quantity being
represented. For instance, in numerical approximations of flow through porous media,
two (or three) state variables are associated with the shape functions which approximate
the displacements of the porous matrix and a single shape function is associated with
the pressure variable. In NeoPZ there exists one entity that contains the information
about the shape functions called connect. Each connect keeps track of the number of
state variables associated with its weight function and consequently it is used to model
poroelastic inclusions, by combining the geometric information for each weight function
in each domain intersection, i.e. one computational mesh can be viewed as an indepen-
dent 2D plane of information that combine the multiphysics classes (see Figure 4.3 ) with
other computational domains, as TPZPoroElastic2d that merges the intersecting meshes
information, following mathematical statements of linear poroelasticity.
Also it is very important to point out that once the variational statement of a multi-
physic problem, for example thermo-poroelasticity,is defined, it can implemented via the
procedure explained in appendix B. Figure 4.3 represents the associated basis and weight



50 Chapter 4. Implementation and validation

functions with each computational mesh, thus the TPZCompMesh and TPZPoroElastic2d
classes have the required data to calculate the contribution of each element.

Geometry Generation using GID
In this section, the process to generate the geometry using GID is described. GID is
a universal, adaptive and user-friendly pre and post-processor for numerical simulation
in science and engineering. It has been designed to cover all the common needs in the
numerical simulations field from pre to post-processing: geometrical modeling, effective
definition of analysis data, meshing, data transfer to analysis software, as well as the
visualization of numerical results. It was chosen for preprocessing the geometry, because

http://www.gidhome.com/support/tutorials 


4.1. Implementation 51

it can be easily adapted to the problem requirements. For LPA geometric input a cus-
tomized material template was defined in order to associate the material identifiers with
the geometric elements (Algorithm 5).
Geometry generation can be done by command line or graphical user interface (GUI). For
the quick generation of meshes, the GUI method is preferred, but to generate a model
for parametric analysis the command line is preferred. Basically, geometry generation is
divided into four steps:

• Open a new project, then select a problem and type ansys55plane, by following
Menu / Data / Problem Type / ansys55 / ansys55plane.

• Save under any name and close the program.

• In the folder of the GID project, replace the content of the *.mat file by Algorithm
5.

• Open the project and generate your own geometry associating the materials identi-
fiers.

Finally once the geometry is generated, it is exported to a *.dump file that contains all
the information of the geometric mesh and the associated materials.

Figure 4.4: Geometry generated in GID and its corresponding geometric mesh.

Xml control file
Extensible Language (XML) is a set of rules for encoding documents in machine readable
form. XML is a popular format for sharing data on internet. Websites that frequently
update their content, such as news sites or blogs, often provide an XML feed so that
external programs can keep abreast of content changes. Uploading and parsing XML
data is a common task for network-connected apps. TinyXML is a simple, small, C++

http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/


52 Chapter 4. Implementation and validation

XML parser that can be easily integrated into other programs. In brief, TinyXML parses
an XML document, and builds from that a Document Object Model (DOM) that can
be read, modified, and saved. Xml files control LPA computations. All the cases and
tests presented here have one GID *.dump and *.xml files that define the control of the
simulation and the simulation times to print information.
In summary, to implement a strong formulation using NeoPZ environment, the attention
is concentrated on coding the corresponding weak formulation in NeoPZ code lines. Weak
forms of linear poroelasticity were translated to NeoPZ syntax as shown in Appendix B.1.
Figure 4.5 shows a simple work flow to generate computational models with LPA; the
information is processed from the geometry created in GID and exported to *.dump
files, then converted for LPA to geometric and computational meshes and the simulation
behavior is defined by *.xml files. The simulation results are post-processed using *.vtk
files in Paraview.

4.2 Computational Tests
In order to demonstrate the code validity, two different problems with analytical solutions
are presented:

1. Step load applied to infinite and finite columns.

2. Mass source injection into a bounded infinite poroelastic medium.

4.3 Step load applied to an elastic half space
The sudden application of a uniform surface load by permeable piston is the natural
consolidation problem. When a burial history occurs in a very short time relative to fluid
diffusion it can be modeled as a step change in vertical load as shown in Figure 4.6.

tic column. Source: redraw from Wang (2000).

Semi-Infinite poroelastic column

Initial and boundary conditions

The problem is to find the excess pore pressure Pex(y,t) , and vertical displacement,
u (y,t), after a uniform downward load ??t0 is suddenly applied at t = 0 on y = 0 of
a vertical infinite column that is constrained laterally for two non flux boundaries. The
vertical load is held constant with time, and the top surface is drained Pex (0, t) = 0.
Mechanical equilibrium requires that the suddenly applied surface load ??t0 be transmit-
ted instantaneously throughout the column. This constant vertical stress at all depths
induces an excess pore pressure Pex = ??t0 at all depths and at different times.

Dimensionless expressions

Using the same procedure for dimensionless forms of poroelastic problem and inserting
the dimensionless groups of table 4.1 in the equations given in Wang (2000), the following
analysis results are obtained:

Excess pore pressure

The governing equation and initial and boundary conditions for excess pore pressure
are mathematically identical to the heat diffusion problem (Figure 4.6). In one specific
conditions of one-dimensional problem, uniaxial strain with constant vertical stresses, the
uncoupled homogeneous pore pressure diffusion equation is obtained as:

PexD (yD, tD) = erfc

(4.1)

at dimensionless argument yD2?tD = 1.0 the excess pore pressure has declined about 15
percent from initial state. Based on this criterion, an estimate of the time it takes for the
surface pressure to propagate diffusively to depth yD is given by tD =

Displacement

An infinite column length means that the initial vertical displacement at the surface
is infinite in response to sudden application of the load. However the time-dependent
displacements of the surface yD of the infinite column is finite and is given as.

Numerical results

The geometric mesh is composed of 10 quadrilateral elements with cubic-quadratic orders
(displacements r1 = 3 and excess pore pressure r2 = 2) representing a column with finite
length of L = 10.0 ( see Figure 4.6 right side). Assuming incompressible rock and fluid
constituents, simulation time of 1 and time step ?tD = 0.001, figures 4.7 and 4.8 show
the evolution of excess pore pressure and displacement at different dimensionless times.
A good approximation is obtained using cubic-quadratic elements.

Finite poroelastic column
In Terzaghi’s classical consolidation test the poroelastic column is finite i.e. L = 1.0. A
constant stress ??t is applied suddenly on the surface z = 0 of a fluid saturated sample
of length L. This problem is analogue to a semi-infinite column with the same boundary
condition and step load. Dimensionless forms of these equations are given by Korsawe
and Starke (2006) as:

The solution of Korsawe and Starke (2006) is described by equation 4.1 for tD &amp;lt;0.04. For
tD greater than this limit the effect of the impermeable boundary is observed in figure
4.11, because limited mass in the finite column doesn’t support pressure for long times.
Consequently a fast draw down is observed in relation to infinite behavior.

The figure 4.12 shows pressure oscillations generated by using linear-linear (L-L or (r1 =
1, r2 = 1)) and quadratic-linear (Q-L) elements when undrained initial response with
incompressible constituents is approximated. Please note that for cubic-quadratic (C-Q)
elements no oscillation was observed. C-Q or higher order elements are used over the
calculations in chapter 5.

Convergence rate in time approximation

The Crank-Nicolson (? = 0.5) finite difference scheme has second-order approximation.
Consequently ? = 0.5 has the best answer in terms of error norm ?error? = ?Un ?Uan?
for each state variable with time step decrease as shown in Figures 4.13 and 4.14. In
general ? = 0.5 will be used to calculate poroelastic responses in chapter 5.

Another consideration is the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition (CFL condition) that
relates the time step size with the size of the discrete parts (elements). Normally, if an
explicit numeric scheme is used, the CFL must be equal to 1 to obtain convergence. The
implicit scheme used here is less sensitive to numerical instability and so larger values of
CFL may be tolerated.

The error norm is computed for spatial discretization refinement and polynomial order
increase, and both cases reflect an increase in the numbers of degrees of freedom. Starting
from a base mesh, spatial refinement or level of refinement are built by dividing each
element into four elements. Figures 4.15 and 4.16 show how the error norm decreases
with progressive refinement.

4.4 Mass source injection into a bounded infinite poroe-
lastic medium

Analytic expressions

In order to validate 2D calculations, the analytical solution by Cleary (1979) was pre-
sented. It was corrected by Rudnicki (1986), and it calculates the poroelastic response
under plain strain condition to constant fluid mass injection/production into a bounded
infinite poroelastic medium (figure 4.19).
Solutions for continuous fluid mass injection rate q per unit of length Lline can be obtained
by the superposition of the solution of instantaneous injection of a amount of fluid Q at
one time (Rudnicki, 1986). As a result of this superposition, fluid mass change is

show that excess pore pressure ?Pex and horizontal stress changes are coupled. Heidbach
(2010) mathematically showed the maximum value of ???Pex PSC ratio from the long-term
limit. By knowing the initial pore pressure and stress field, the spatio-temporal evolution
of excess pore pressure and horizontal stress changes caused by fluid injection/production
from mass sources is:

??
?Pex

(? + 2µ)
I (4.14)

This means that for long times of constant fluid injection/production the excess pore
pressure and the stresses rise a constant changes for each volume of fluid removed from the
rock, thus areas with considerable long times of average constant injection or production
may be near to this long term, if the rock behavior is assumed linear.

Figure 4.20 shows the setup of the 2D plane quarter-domain FE-model. The problem has
2 planes of symmetry. Heidbach (2010) uses the parameters presented in table 4.2. Initial
conditions are assumed zero and boundary conditions are:

• An injection point (red point) located at the center e.g. intersection of symmetry
lines

• Symmetry lines have non flux and null displacements in x direction for blue line and
y direction for withe line.

• Far field contour is a free normal stress and drained condition (red line).

Here, a zero dimensional element is used (Point element located in corner, see Figure 4.20)
to represent the mass line source. For this problem the dimensionless time step is small
due to the need to compare secondary variables, in other words, it is indispensable to have
a good match in state variables (excess pore pressure and displacements). The spatio-
temporal evolution of PSC was computed for long times. Heidbach (2010) computed the
poroelastic response of Rudnicki (1986) three-dimensional solution with a homogeneous
2D axis-symmetric FE model and solved the poroelasticity equations using a commercial
software package ABAQUS / StandardTM. Similarly, this modeling was based on a 2D
version of Rudnicki (1986) analytic solution under plane strain conditions, modeled with
LPA.
For long times tD = 10.0, 2D solutions converge to the same PSC ratio of tangential
stresses in 3D solutions ?µ(?+2µ) =

?(1?2?)
2(1??) (Heidbach, 2010). This limit is one half of the

radial stress limit. Assuming a = 0.7 and ? = 0.3, the PSC ratio for long times is equal
to 0.2 (figure 4.25).

Numerical Results

Figures 4.21, 4.22, 4.23 and 4.25 show a comparison between numerical and analytical
excess pore pressure, stresses and PSC ratio distributions along different plot lines. Com-
puted excess pore pressure, stress distributions and PSC ratios fit the analytical solutions.

Close to the injection point excess pore pressure is larger than the stress changes. With
increasing distance to the injection, point excess pore pressure decreases more rapidly
than the stress changes. This leads to an intersection point of the pore pressure profile
with the ?x profile. The location of this intersection point depends on the duration
of injection. The y direction stress changes, i.e. ?y along the x direction, even become
slightly negative before converging towards zero with distance, this means that the induced
total stress change is compressive. For two-dimensional LPA approximation, figure 4.23
shows that the numerical results fit those values at the injection point, and diverge with
the increase in distance from the point source. In addition calculations in displacements
are overestimated from xD &gt; 1.0, since the numerical approximation uses an unbounded
elastic to model an infinite bounded domain. Analytical long-term limit of PSC ratio of



68 Chapter 4. Implementation and validation

0.2 is obtained with the two-dimensional solution for radial stresses as in Heidbach (2010)
for tangential stresses.

4.5 Summary
In this chapter, a brief description for the NeoPZ environment and LPA implementation
was shown. LPA was based on three principal classes that interact to solve a poroelastic
problem with the finite element procedures given in chapter 3. A multiphysics point of
view was inherited from NeoPZ. LPA validation was presented in terms of 1D and 2D
dimensional modeling and error norm charts were given for one-dimensional cases showing
the convergence of LPA to analytic solutions, validating the implementation.



5. Fault reactivation

In this section, a series of calculations are presented to illustrate the problem of reactiva-
tion and its corresponding numerical approximation with the suggested implementation,
showing several advantages over analytical approaches. Also, the effect of various param-
eters as reviewed in chapter 1 is shown.

mensions. RD is the reservoir depth measured from surface to reservoir top plus one half
Ra. The rectangular inclusion is depleted ±?Pex (e.g. ?Pex &amp;lt;0 represents oil produc-
tion) for all x ? ? (e.g. homogeneous excess pore pressure distribution). Mechanical
conditions for side burden rocks are zero normal stress at surface ?n = 0, lateral bound-
ary displacements in x direction are zero, bottom boundary displacements in y direction
are zero. The problem is to find the stress changes due to reservoir depletion with the
corresponding boundary conditions.

Comparison of LPA computations with other numerical approximation (STARS simulator)
are given in the next section by contrasting with equation 2.74 representing the solution
given in Hawkes (2009).

LPA Calculations

Using the material properties given in Table 5.1 and ?Pex &amp;lt;0 (e.g. depletion) and
the computational mesh presented in figure 5.2, the calculations of ? due to poroelastic
inclusion (blue color) are compared with results obtained using STARS.

It is important to point out that the formulation here is linear and the initial static state is
a solution that can be separated from the stress and pore pressure excess changes. Figure
5.3 shows the calculations given in this section (dotted lines) compared with calculations
including an arbitrary initial state, by subtracting this initial state from the current solu-
tion at one specific time t, the same response is obtained, assuming zero initial conditions
at the same specific time; i.e. the initial state is important to place the problem in a
specific physic situation, but the stress and excess pore pressure changes determine the
essential part of the reactivation in linear analysis. It is clear that for non-linear formula-
tions and no static initial conditions, this is not possible. Nevertheless, following equation
2.79, the sign ? depends on the faulting regime acting on (e.g. normal faulting or reverse
faulting stress regimes) the initial condition (Hawkes, 2009).

Figures 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6 show vertical horizontal and shear arching ratios calculated with
LPA. From equation 2.77, please note that zero contour represents the change of sign
in stress and, following the conventional sign in continuum mechanics, compression is
negative, so the positive values of ? in this contours represents compression since ?Pex &amp;lt;0
as in Hawkes (2009).

STARS Calculations

STARS is a coupled fluid flow and geomechanics simulator developed by Computer Mod-
elling Group Ldt. (Calgary, AB, Canada) and used extensively by the petroleum industry
worldwide. The fluid flow model is a multiphase, multicomponent reactive flow, that can
simulate the injection and flow of gases, solvents, polymers, surfactants, and other chem-
icals. It can be run isothermally or not. The geomechanics module can simulate linear
and non-linear elasticity, elastoplasticity and viscoleasticity behavior, as well fracturing
effects.
The geometric mesh is composed of 301 cells in j direction and 321 cells in k direction with
different cell dimensions near the reservoir. Please note that for this model, discussion
about dimension are irrelevant since spatial data is scaled for comparison purposes. Thus,
the relation between reservoir thickness - extension and its depth must be the same for
comparison purposes.
In this example, there is one well producing from the centre of the reservoir during a
given time and after this period, it is shut-in until a homogeneous excess pore pressure
distribution is obtained. This final step is used to calculated the stress changes. Figure
5.7 shows the contours of ?x that have the same shape that the contours in figure 5.4. Is
important to point out that null contour is independent of how the variables are scaled,
since the null contour is invariant after non-dimensionalization (i.e. the null contour
shown in figure 5.4 has exactly the same shape of ?x = 0 shown in figure 5.7).
Since the solution in Hawkes (2009) is in dimensionless forms, ? computed by STARS is



74 Chapter 5. Fault reactivation

normalized with (1?2?)
??Pex(1??) to obtain the same values. Permeabilities and fluid viscosities

used in STARS are arbitrary, because a stationary solution at a determinate time (ho-
mogeneous change in pressure), after shut-in time, is obtained. Hence, elastic parameters
and Biot’s coefficient are required be the same. In addition, it is necessary to disable
thermal and plastic calculations in STARS to compute a pure linear elastic response.
Data generate by STARS are computed on center points and middle point between cells
faces. This data is smoothed with CMG post-processing tool (Results 3D) and used to
plot figures 5.9 and 5.8.

Figure 5.7: ?x contour for rectangular reservoir geometry using STARS. Visualization
with Results 3D.

Figure 5.8 shows ?x and ?y along plot line ((0,0),(0,-2.0)) with coordinates associated with
figure 5.1. STARS results and LPA calculations fit Hawkes (2009) curves out of reservoir
domain. However, STARS model is imprecise near to reservoir boundary (see figure 5.9)
indicating that it is necessary to apply local refinement in this region as is illustrated in
figure 5.2 for LPA geometric mesh.
Unfortunately STARS cannot use its mesh refinement tools when the geomechanics module
is used. The natural way to improve the solution is to create a new grid with local
refinement, increasing the number of DOF. On the other hand, LPA fits the curves, in
and out reservoir domain.
For these models, the computational times do not exceed 3 minutes showing the accurate
computations of LPA in comparison with commercial software STARS in terms of linear
poroelasticity and mono-phasic flow. This example illustrates the validation of LPA in
comparison with a commercial tool, modelling a rectangular reservoir as a poroelastic
inclusion. Also, it is important to note that STARS is able to simulate more sophisticated
and complex fluid flow models than hydromechanics problems.

Figure 5.12: ?FR along reservoir extension. ?FR normalized by (1?2?)(1??) , (?FR &amp;lt;0 tendency

The fault reactivation tendency analysis is based on mapping the null contour ?FR = 0,
since it represents the change in compression and tension stress state. Using the Table
2.2, any fault inclined at 60 degrees that is crossed by the null contour has a tendency to
reactivate for negative values of ?FR, and a tendency to stabilize for positive values ?FR,
when normal fault regime is assumed.

5.1.1 Fault reactivation threshold
Induced earthquake ?CFS module as 0.1 MPa have been found to induce seismic activity
in faulting settings where initial ?CFS values are close to zero (Segall, 1992; Guyoton
and Volant, 1992; Rudnicki, 1999; Ferronato, 2008; Hawkes, 2009). If this value is assumed
to be consistent with fault gouge in this example, it is possible to define a threshold value
?FRt = ?CFSt??pex =

0.1
??pex , and all negative values over this threshold strictly represent a

strong tendency to reactivate. Thus, using ? = 0.8 and ?Pex = ?10 MPa, is equivalent
to ?FRt = ?0.0125, and it can be interpreted in previously results as follows:

• Figure 5.10 shows that faults at far offsets, despite having negative values, the
tendency to reactivate is null.

• Figure 5.11 shows that fault at offset 0 tends to reactivate at depths equivalent to
the left reservoir flank.



5.1. The rectangular reservoir problem 79

• Figure 5.12 shows that any plane inclined 60 degrees crossing the reservoir reacti-
vates along all reservoir extension. Consequently, the fault at offset 1 has a strong
tendency in localized parts because it crosses the reservoir on the right flank.

5.1.2 Side burden dimensions

Another important question at this point is: which is the optimal size of the hosting
material in order to avoid boundary effects?. According with Osorio (1992) it is important
to minimize boundary effects is important in reservoir geomechanics modeling. This
reduces the computational cost and makes reasonable solutions in regions possible near
the reservoir rocks. Figure 5.13 shows dimensionless displacements computed with 2.72
for side burden rocks along depth and extensions. Displacements tend to zero but never
reach this value for infinite behavior.

To illustrate the effect of boundaries, a reference model (Black line fitting Hawkes (2009)
solution, figure 5.14) was used to evaluate differences between several hosting material
dimensions presented in table 5.2. Based on figure 5.15 and table 5.2 the choice of case
5 has small errors (error was not quantified) in comparison with the reference model,
but for practical modelling with the combination of case 2 with case 4, it is possible to
capture infinite behavior with Ra

&amp;lt;110 . Thus, for a region defined by one
rectangle with dimensions Ra and Rb, and hosting material with ? ? 0.3, it is modeled
with small errors in displacements since ? is a secondary variable in LPA computations.
If the interest is modeling regions near the reservoir, case 2 is a good option, because all
cases in Table 5.2 were tested into reservoir domain without considerable differences in ?,
but for brevity results are not shown here.

5.1.3 Friction coefficient variation
Friction coefficient in most of rocks can vary from 0.4 to 0.8 for different brittle rocks
materials (Hawkes, 2009; Germanovich, 2004). Figure 5.16 shows the effect of µs variation
in the null contour, showing that for rectangular case there is no significant effect for faults
inclined 60 degrees.

normalized by (1?2?)(1??) .

5.1.4 Material contrast
Material contrast is an important factor. In relation to initial case with similar elastic
modules, two cases are presented:

• Case 1: soft side burden rocks with young modulus one tenth of the base case (e.g.
?case1 = 0.1 ??base and µcase1 = 0.1 ?µbase).

• Case 2: rigid side burden rocks with young modulus ten times bigger (e.g. ?case2 =
10.0 ??base, µcase2 = 10.0 ?µbase ).

Figure 5.17 shows that, with the same set of faults, soft side burden favors fault stability,
and rigid side burdens favor fault reactivation, having a strong effect on fault reactivation
factor. Please note that several negative regions are generated by soft reservoir compaction
or contraction.

5.2. Reservoir with non-constant pressure distribution 85

5.1.5 Tilted reservoir

Reservoir inclination and geometry are important since they have a strong effect in ?FR.
Figure 5.18 shows that faults near the reservoir flanks have larger regions with tendency
to reactivate than horizontal reservoir with the same depletion level.

5.1.6 Reservoir geometry

To analyze more complicated reservoirs, accounting for more realistic geometries, through-
out this example the effect of reservoir shape is illustrated. Figure 5.19 shows that near
the anticline flanks there are larger regions with tendency of reactivation in comparison
with rectangular shape for the same depletion level.

All these effects represent changes in ?FR null contour, but the pore pressure excess is not
homogeneous and constant. However, it is possible to use previous solutions to obtain a
rough approximation when the reservoir in general has a smooth change in pore pressure,
thus the average pore pressure can be used to calculate ? and ?FR factors. Nevertheless
oil production programs represent no constant, no homogeneous pore pressure fields and
they have an important effect on ?FR distributions.

5.2 Reservoir with non-constant pressure distribu-
tion

In this section, fault reactivation analysis is used for different productions schemes, in
order to evaluate the effect of reservoir depletion (non-constant pressure distribution) on
fault reactivation tendency.

5.2.1 Reservoir depletion due to one well

Constant unit rate

One well producing at constant unit rate (e.g. qD = ?1.0) is draining the reservoir at
different offsets in x direction, at a depth of one half of the reservoir thickness plus the
reservoir top depth. All these cases use the same set of faults previously defined.

Figures 5.20, 5.22 show that for initial times, null contour lies on the center of production,



90 Chapter 5. Fault reactivation

faults near the reservoir well location have a tendency to reactivate in time. If the well
location is near the reservoir flanks, the fault in this side increases its risk of reactivation
since the production and stress changes are larger for this region in comparison to the
opposite side.
To define which faults reactivate using ?CFSt = 0.1 MPa, Table 5.3 is used to calculate
the diffusivity c = 0.269757 m2/s and the excess pore pressure reference value for a
source line of length Lline = 1000.0 m, Pex0 =

?FRt = ?CFStPex0 = ?0.8 MPa, this is the dimensionless threshold used to compare LPA
computations based on Table 2.1.

Table 5.3 represents one specific situation for one well with rate of 1080 m3/d, perforated at
a depth of 3075 m and producing oil with ? = 0.001 Pa s from reservoir with thickness 150
m, reservoir extension 3000 m and average permeability ? = 1.0·10?13 m2. This situation
illustrates how it is possible to use the results for one production well at different rates
with different ?FRt values. For ?FRt = ?0.8 previous results can be interpreted as follows:

• Figure 5.20 shows that for far and near offset faults, despite having values with
a negative trend, faults have a null tendency to reactivate at dimensionless time
tD = 0.06 after 23 d of constant production.

• Figure 5.21 shows that the fault at offset 0 does not reach the critical value of
tD = 0.09 (after 35 d), at depths equivalent to reservoir flanks. The fault at offset
1 reach the critical value of tD = 0.09 (after 35 d).

When the rate is twice large, the threshold value turns to ?FRt = ?0.4, the scenario is
different for 23 d of production and there is a strong tendency to reactivate the fault at
offset 0.
In the case of the production well on the left flank under the same operating conditions,
results can be interpreted as follows:

• Figure 5.22 shows that for far and near offset faults, despite having negative values,
faults have a null tendency to reactivate at dimensionless time tD = 0.06 after 23 d
of constant production. Note that for fault at offset 0, the effect of production on
the left side is relevant.



5.2. Reservoir with non-constant pressure distribution 91

• Figure 5.23 shows that the fault at offset 1 reaches the critical value for tD = 0.2
(after 77 d) of constant production.

Thus it is possible to do a parametric analysis with these simulation results for different
reservoir depths, permeabilities, fluid viscosities and well rates, as well as bhp pressures by
setting this condition for line sources, since all these calculations are given in dimensionless
forms. This explains, why despite linear poroelastic problem being well know, the use
of dimensionless forms exploits poroelastic computations for simple problems in isotropic
and homogeneous materials, obtained by solving one specific problem (“master problem”).
Thus, it is possible to obtain different solutions with simple post-processing computations.

5.2.2 Reservoir depletion due to injection-production scheme

In this section, fault reactivation is analyzed in two cases when injection and production
exist, at the same time, as shown in Figure 5.24.

• The first case is a simple unitary injection/production array on the left and right
reservoir flanks respectively.

• In second case, the reservoir is depleted by single production well during 0.05 units
of tD, after this time, two injection wells on reservoir lateral flanks start the injection
to maintain the reservoir pressure with one half of unitary rate (i.e. qD = ?0.5).

Figure 5.24: Production strategy to analyze the effect of depletion. Left) case 1. Right)
case 2.



92 Chapter 5. Fault reactivation

Case 1

Two mass sources at unitary rate qD = ±1.0 (injection - production) with normal faulting
regime. The situation represented by Table 5.4 (c = 0.0269757 m2/s, using Lline = km,
the result is ?FR = ?0.8) is critic when the velocity has positive x axis direction (left-right
direction). The fault at offset 1 for time tD = 0.01 (e.g. 38 d) has a strong tendency
because the production induces rock contraction and favors reactivation (see Figure 5.26
(Top)). If this flow occurs in the opposite direction negative x axis direction, the fault at
offset 1 has a tendency to reactivate for constant injection twice as large, i.e. ?FR = ?0.4
(invert sign of ?FR) at tD = 0.02 (e.g. 77 d) (see Figure 5.26 (Bottom)).

The fault at offset 0 after tD = 0.5 (i.e. 5 years) does not attain the limit (see Figure 5.27
(Top)). However, for opposite flow direction, in the negative x axis direction, this fault
reactivates for tD = 0.08 (e.g. 308 d) (see Figure 5.27 (Bottom)) when the production
rate is twice the one in table 5.4 (invert the sign of ?FR).

Case 2

In this case, injection at reservoir flanks to maintain reservoir pressure is analyzed. Using
the rate of production in Table 5.5, c = 0.0269757 m2/s, Lline = 10 km, and the corre-
sponding threshold value is ?FR = ?0.4. Figure 5.28 and 5.29 (Top) show that for time
tD = 0.08 (i.e 308 d) fault at offset 1 is near to reactivation, since after tD = 0.09 (i.e. 346
d) or 38 d of constant injection in flanks (see Figure 5.28 and 5.29 (Bottom)). The fault
begins to stabilize, since injection expands the rock in favor of positive values of ?FR.

5.3 Summary
Fault instability due to uniform depletion of a reservoir and due to various non-uniform
depletion strategies has been analyzed by conducting an extensive parametric analysis
using dimensionless LPA calculations. Computations have been compacted in charts for
different reservoir geometries and depths using dimensionless parameters. Also, several
interesting effects on fault stability were shown according to the literature.



6. Discussion

6.1 Main results
An implementation for fault reactivation analysis based on Biot’s linear poroelasticity
of cross-sections in half-space, under plane strain conditions, has been developed. LPA
takes into account both traction and displacement continuity between the reservoir sides.
The developed code allows considering the reservoir to have rather arbitrary shapes and
non-uniform pressure distribution inside the reservoir by modeling diffusive mono-phasic
flow, and different material properties of the reservoir and the surrounding medium. Us-
ing this program, redistributed stresses around a depleted, homogeneous reservoir with
non-uniform pressure distribution have been calculated and the fault instability due to
reservoir depletion has been analyzed.

6.2 Conclusions
From this work, it can be concluded that:

• Using numerical modeling it was corroborated that fault reactivation potential is
dependent on reservoir geometry, dip angle, reservoir shape and material contrast.
Hence, it is very important to consider the real reservoir geometry in the analysis
of induced fault reactivation.

• Different reservoir depletion strategies affect the fault stability differently. Pore
pressure gradients inside the reservoir have a greater tendency to reactivate and
induce slip of the nearby faults. Direction of depletion is an important consideration
in evaluating the fault zones prone to slip.

• The Coulomb failure stress change methodology is appropriate for settings where
faults are relatively close to their frictional limits (e.g., recently or currently active
fold and thrust belts; recently or actively subsiding basins). However, in an absolute

99



100 Chapter 6. Discussion

sense, a positive ?CFS value will not necessarily result in a significant risk of fault
reactivation in settings where the shear stresses on existing faults are relatively low.

• In literature, it is common to find numerical hydromechanics models that not con-
sider an reasonable side burden rocks size. In order to avoid boundary effects a
series of computations are presented in charts to model regions near or far of reser-
voir domains with acceptable accuracy.

• An implementation using NeoPZ environment was developed. It can be used to anal-
yse fault reactivation tendency by means of linear poroelasticity equations using or
not dimensionless calculations. Dimensionless calculations allow LPA calculated
thermoelastic problems in structural analysis. Also, a 3D extension of this compu-
tational implementation is trivial since it was developed in a generic environment
to develop finite element programs.

• During the development of this work, several multiphysics classes in NeoPZ en-
vironment were created and their corresponding validation for linear poroelastic
monophasic flow is shown in this dissertation. LPA computations compared sev-
eral analytic and semi-analytic solutions presented in literature and the commercial
software STARS.

• The fault reactivation analysis presented in this work applies to multiphase flow
models since the pressure coupling of the equations is given for an average of the
partial pressure of each phase, when linear poroelasticity is assumed.

• NeoPZ environment allows the quick development of complex finite element pro-
grams since it uses the paradigm of Object Oriented Programming.

6.3 Recommendations for future work
The developed approach provides a basis for a robust reservoir simulation accounting for
the poroelastic effects on geologic faults. The following modifications/additions to this
model are recommended for future work:

• Several LPA characteristics were not presented in this dissertation; modeling no
conductive faults, modeling several reservoir with heterogeneous formations. Hence,
it is recommended to evaluate these characteristics.

• LPA has not been adequately tested by back-analyzing case histories of production
and injection-induced fault slip.



6.3. Recommendations for future work 101

• Extension to three dimensions, multiphase flow and permeability-stress coupling.

• Model the mechanical interaction between fault blocks and the depleting reservoir,
as well modeling fault slip to obtain a more accurate estimate of fault onset and
slip. This implies non linear analyses.

• The current model assumes completely reversible, elastic rock mass response to
both depletion and injection. However, especially in poorly consolidated rocks, the
stress–strain response during compression can be very different from the response
in extension. This implies the use of nonlinear models.

A. Dimensionless forms

A.1 Computation of dimensionless forms
Based on the proof of the Buckingham ? theorem and the homogeneity theorem Wong
(1990) gives the matrix relationships:

Spar = RparPpar (A.1)

where Spar is the secondary variable matrix, Ppar is the principal variable matrix, Rpar
is the relationship matrix that contains the dimensionless groups by choosing Ppar and
Spar, from the complete set of parameter involved in the problem. Rpar is computed as in
Wong (1990) using:

Rpar = SparP?1par (A.2)

the dimensionless form of the equations in question are obtained by inserting the dimen-
sionless groups calculated in the original expressions.

Step load direct dimensionless formulation
The analysis is based on length [m], mass [Kg] and time [s] as fundamental units. The
object of this part is to determine from the next set of variables the corresponding dimen-
sionless form of the equations given by Wang (2000) for Semi-infinite column problem.

• L [m] : Domain max dimension.

• P [ s2

• z [m] : The column depth as positive value.

• uz [m] : Z-direction displacement.

• t [s] : Time.

The parameters matrix MP, P (independent parameters) and S (dependent parameters)
matrices are defined as

Table A.1: Step Load one dimensional consolidation matrices. MP matrix of rank 3, P,
S set of principal and secondary variables.

The matrix R is computed as R = SP?1 Wong (1990) is obtained R matrix, that contains
the relationship between the secondary and dimensionless variables as follow:

of dimensionless group of variables.

By inserting the expressions of the Table A.2 into original expressions (Wang, 2000), and
simplifying dimensionless forms are obtained as:

B. Contribute Method

B.1 Poroelastic Contribute Method

Since the matrix problem is associated with a weak statement, the approximation spaces
can be changed, but here, CG modeling is used with H1 Sobolev space with different
polynomial orders. Algorithms 1, 2, 3 and 4 calculate the matrices contribution at the
element level. All these element contributions are calculated and assembled to obtain the
global stiffness matrix, mass matrix and vectors presented in 3.73 and 3.74.
Let’s introduce the expanded forms of the matrices and vectors 3.60, 3.61, 3.62, 3.63,
3.65, 3.66 in terms of shape and test functions 3.53, 3.54, 3.55, 3.56, using plain strain
conditions, where mathematical operators are expanded in terms of spatial derivatives
