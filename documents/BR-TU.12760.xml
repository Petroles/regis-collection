RESUMO ALARGADO 

Os solos derivados de materiais vulcânicos, representando 0,84% da área de solos no mundo, são 

caracterizados por acumularem grandes quantidades de matéria orgânica (MO), cerca de 5,0 % de carbono 

global, e pelo elevado teor de fósforo (P) retido pelos abundantes compostos de alumínio (Al) e ferro (Fe), 

existentes nestes solos. A retenção de P referida é a principal limitação à absorção de P pelas plantas e ao 

rendimento das culturas, devido ao baixo teor biodisponível de P na solução do solo. Assim, torna-se 

necessário o recurso à adubação fosfatada, por forma a suprir as necessidades das culturas. Na ilha do Pico, 

arquipélago dos Açores, cerca de 40 % dos solos agrícolas são prados de pastagem, sendo praticada, 

portanto, a adubação P sem incorporação no solo, incluindo os solos de encostas mais declivosas. 

O trabalho agora apresentado, articulado em dois estudos e dedicado a solos derivados de materiais 

vulcânicos e recolhidos na ilha do Pico, teve os seguintes objetivos: (i) a avaliação do risco potencial de 

perdas de P para águas, (ii) o relacionamento das propriedades de Andossolos, nomeadamente os teores de 

Al e Fe extraíveis por oxalato de amónio (Alox e Feox) e das frações de P, com a atividade das exoenzimas 

fosfatase ácida (AP) e ?-glucosidase (?G), bem como (iii) a avaliação do esforço microbiano na aquisição 

de P. 

A adubação mineral e a deposição de urinas e fezes dos animais em pastoreio são os responsáveis 

pela acumulação de P nas camadas superficiais dos solos, tendo-se observado, neste estudo, um teor médio 

de 3,7 g Pt kg
-1, valor que pode ser considerado muito elevado e que sugere situações de sobrefertilização. 

Simultaneamente, a eutrofização de águas de superfície, devido a poluição difusa, é um problema real no 

arquipélago dos Açores, sendo os solos agrícolas a sua causa mais óbvia. Por outro lado, os compostos de 

Al e Fe, responsáveis pela intensa retenção de P, parecem estar também envolvidos na elevada acumulação 

de matéria orgânica nas camadas superficiais destes solos, reprimindo a atividade enzimática e microbiana, 

e/ou protegendo a matéria orgânica da mineralização. 

Os Andossolos Háplicos e Plácicos apresentaram teores de carbono orgânico (OC), Alox e Feox mais 

elevados que os Andossolos Vítricos. Em oposição ao OC e às diferentes frações de P, os teores de Alox e 

Feox aumentam com a profundidade dos solos. O P orgânico (Po) e inorgânico (Pi) representam 54 e 46 % 

do P total (Pt), observando-se um maior contributo de Po nos Andossolos Háplicos e Plácicos e de Pi nos 

Andossolos Vítricos. 

Os teores de Pi-Olsen, P-AL e P-CaCl2 encontram-se acima dos valores críticos agronómicos 

referidos na literatura. Contudo, o índice de saturação de fósforo (ISP) nos solos estudados são inferiores a 

25 %, valor acima do qual os solos se encontram em risco de desadsorção de P. Em média, o grupo de três 

Andossolos Vítricos apresentaram valores de ISP mais elevados (14,1 %) que os restantes três Andossolos 

Háplicos e Plácicos (6,6 %). Em condições laboratoriais que pretendem antever os riscos de P relativos à 

drenagem interna de solos (1: 100), escorrimento superficial (1: 1000) e sedimentos sob massas de água 



 

xiv 
 

estáticas (1: 10000), usando o 0,01 M CaCl2 como eletrólito, observa-se que os teores de P desadsorvido se 

encontravam abaixo dos limites críticos ambientais, respetivamente de 0,1, 0,05 e 0,02-0,03 mg P L-1. 

Deste modo, a eutrofização das massas de água, não deverá ter como fonte difusa o P desadsorvido 

dos Andossolos estudados. Uma vez que os adubos fosfatados são aplicados à superfície dos solos, sem 

incorporação, deve ser considerada a hipótese do direto escorrimento superficial dos mesmos durante 

episódios de precipitação, antes mesmo de ocorrer a completa solubilização do P aplicado e sua e interação 

com a matriz do solo. Assim, a aplicação localizada de fertilizantes, em profundidade com menor frequência, 

deverá ser considerada como uma alternativa à interditação do uso de adubos, mesmo nas áreas mais 

sensíveis e montanhosas das bacias hidrográficas das ilhas do Arquipélago dos Açores. 

Considerando a influência do material originário dos solos e o efeito da sua gestão no teor e 

distribuição vertical da MO e da atividade enzimática, verificou-se a acumulação de OC e de diferentes 

formas de Po nas camadas mais superficiais. Em simultâneo, ambos os parâmetros apresentam-se altamente 

correlacionados com os teores de Alox e Feox, em particular com Feox, e com o gradiente em profundidade 

da AP e ?G. Ao contrário do referido na literatura, o elevado teor de Pi nos solos, resultado da fertilização 

mineral fosfatada, não parece promover, só por si, a inibição da atividade da AP. Considerando as 30 

amostras de solo estudadas, observaram-se correlações significativas e diretamente proporcionais entre a 

AP e as diferentes formas de Pi, nomeadamente Pi total, Pi-Olsen e P-CaCl2. 

Observaram-se elevadas razões AP: ?G, quando se avaliou a relação estequiométrica entre ambas 

as exoenzimas. Estes resultados indicam que a biodisponibilidade real de P é mais reduzida do que a 

disponibilidade sugerida pelos métodos de avaliação laboratorial que utilizam soluções químicas extrativas. 

Se na matriz do solo, o teor de Pi existir em quantidade suficiente para suprimir as necessidades microbianas 

para a manutenção da homeostasia e crescimento, a alocação energética para a produção de AP deverá 

diminuir. Contudo, devido à elevada retenção de Pi nos constituintes de Al e Fe, deverá ocorrer uma alocação 

energética suplementar para a produção da AP, no sentido da mineralização de Po, por forma a assegurarem 

a aquisição de P para a manutenção da homeostasia. No caso dos solos com elevados teores de Alox e Feox, 

os Andossolos Háplicos e Plácicos, a razão AP: ?G variou entre 10,7 e 14,7, em oposição, os Andossolos 

Vítricos, com menores teores de Alox e Feox, que apresentaram uma razão AP: ?G média de 5,6. 

Relativamente ao potencial de aquisição C:P (ln(?G)/ln(AP)), os Andossolos Háplicos e Plácicos 

apresentaram um valor médio de 0.78 e os Andossolos Vítricos 0.85. Sendo o valor de referência global 

0.95, os potenciais de aquisição C:P determinados sugerem, mais uma vez, a reduzida biodisponibilidade 

de P nos solos estudados. Em ambos os casos, observa-se que o esforço para a aquisição de P e o potencial 

de aquisição C:P são afetados pela dimensão das diferentes frações de Pi e teores de Al e Fe presentes no 

solo. 

Por outro lado, o valor da razão molar C:P média dos solos estudados é de 115. Sendo 166 o valor 

de referência para solos de pastagem, valor acima do qual a literatura indica que se deverão verificar 

situações de carência de P, os resultados obtidos parecem indicar que este valor crítico deverá ser ajustado 

no caso dos Andossolos. 



 

xv 
 

Por último, os resultados obtidos não nos permitem avaliar, de um modo inequívoco, a razão sobre 

os elevados teores de OC nos solos derivados de materiais vulcânicos. Contudo, fica evidente o papel central 

e determinante dos minerais ativos de Al e Fe nessa acumulação, em virtude: (i) da capacidade dos minerais 

ativos de Al e Fe em se ligarem e protegerem as moléculas orgânicas da mineralização; (ii) da reduzida 

atividade da ?G, atividade que parece ser reprimida pelos compostos de Al e Fe, afetando a taxa de 

mineralização de OC; e (iii) da alocação energética para a aquisição de P devido à retenção de Pi nestes 

solos, alterando as reações metabólicas celulares e limitando o crescimento do compartimento da biomassa 

microbiana do solo, responsável pela mineralização da matéria orgânica.

EXTENDED ABSTRACT 

The disproportionate amount of organic matter, nearly 5,0 % of global carbon, and the high 

Phosphorus (P) content sorbed by aluminium (Al) and iron (Fe) soil components are characteristic 

of soils derived from volcanic materials. Simultaneously, the reported P retention it is a main 

limitation for crop P uptake and production yield, due to its limited bioavailability. To overcome 

this major constraint, P fertilization is needed to supply production yield needs. In Pico island 

nearly 40 % of the agricultural land is used for grassland pastures and superficial P fertilization 

without incorporation is the main practice, even in situations with high slopes.  

Working with soils derived from volcanic materials collected in Pico Island, Azores 

archipelago, this combined study aimed to assess the potential risk of P loss into receiving waters, 

and relate soil andic properties and P characteristics to the extra cellular enzyme acid phosphatase 

(AP) and ?-glucosidase (?G) activities.  

Fertilization is responsible for P accumulation at the soil surface, with values that can be 

classified as too high, such as the average value of 3.7 g Pt kg
-1 observed in the present study, which 

suggest situations of P over-fertilization. Simultaneously, eutrophication of waterbodies is an 

actual problem in the Azorean archipelago and soils are the obvious source of this non-point 

pollution. On the other hand, the Al and Fe soil compounds seem to be involved in the high organic 

matter content retained in the superficial layers of these soils, repressing microbial and enzyme 

activity and/or protecting organic matter from mineralization.  

Haplic and Placic Andosols presented higher organic carbon (OC), Alox and Feox 

(ammonium oxalate extractable) contents than the Vitric Andosols, and Alox and Feox values show 

an increase along the soils depth, opposite to the different P pools. The organic (Po) and inorganic 

(Pi) P contents represented nearly 54 and 46 % of total P (Pt), respectively. Haplic and Placic 

Andosols had higher Po contribution, and Vitric Andosols a higher contribution of Pi.  

Despite Pi-Olsen, P-AL and P-CaCl2 contents were above the agronomical threshold values, 

none of the studied soils had DPS values above the conservative critical value of 25 %. On average, 

Vitric Andosols presented higher values (14.1 %) than Haplic and Placic Andosols (6.6 %). When 

assessing the desorbed P with 0.01M CaCl2 as the electrolyte solution for mimicking conditions for 

P in drainage (1: 100), runoff (1: 1000) and static waterbodies (1: 10000), the desorbed P contents 

in all the soils were below the environmental critical limits, respectively 0.1, 0.05 and 0.02-3 mg P 

L-1.  

The results indicate that soil Pi is still below the environmental thresholds, although above 

the agronomical threshold. Therefore, P desorption from the studied Andosols do not seem to be 



 

xviii 

 

the main source for waterbodies eutrophication. Since inorganic fertilizers are superficially applied, 

it must be considered the hypothesis of their direct runoff during rainfall events, before complete 

dissolution and P interaction with soil matrix. Therefore, the fertilizer application with deep-

banding systems in longer periods of time needs to be considered as an alternative to the 

interdiction of the use of fertilizers on the most sensitive and hilly areas of the watersheds. 

Regarding the effect of the management on the size and vertical distribution of organic 

molecules and enzyme activity, it was observed a superficial accumulation of organic carbon (OC) 

and Po pool, which was highly correlated with Alox and Feox contents, particularly with Feox, and 

with the stratified gradient of the evaluated enzymes activities. Soil P richness, as the result of 

inorganic P fertilization, did not show an inhibition effect on AP activity. In fact, when considering 

all the 30 soil samples under study, AP activity showed a linear and significant relationships with 

the different Pi pools, namely with total Pi, Pi-Olsen and P-CaCl2. 

When assessing the stoichiometric relationship between both enzymes, high values for the 

AP: ?G ratio were obtained. These values suggest that microbial communities allocate high energy 

effort to ensure P acquisition for homeostasis maintenance. In Haplic and Placic Andosols, with 

higher Alox and Feox contents, the AP: ?G ranged from 10.7 to 14.7, contrasting with the average 

value of 5.6 presented by the Vitric Andosols. Concerning the potential C:P acquisition (ln(?G): 

ln(AP)), Haplic and Placic Andosols showed an average of 0.78 and Vitric Andosols an average of 

0.85, values which are below the global threshold limit of 0.95, above which soils are supposed to 

have an adequate P availability. 

The effort for P acquisition and the potential of C:P acquisition indices are both affected by 

the size of the Pi pools and by Alox + Feox contents. If available Pi was present at levels able to 

supply growth requirements and ensure homeostasis condition, the energy allocation to produce 

AP enzymes would decrease. Since Pi retention is high in Andosols, due to high Al and Fe minerals 

content, energy allocation shifts to the production of AP enzymes to mineralize soil Po. Moreover, 

the average C:P molar ratio of the six soils (115) is below the threshold value proposed for pasture 

soils (166), above which soils may present low P availability, which means that threshold value 

needs to be adjusted for Andosols. 

Despite the central and determinant role of the active Al and Fe, the present results do not 

allow a clear justification for the high OC contents on the soils derived from volcanic materials, 

since Al and Fe compounds are simultaneously related with different soil parameters. Therefore, 

some hypothesis may be considered for that accumulation: (i) the ability of Al and Fe compounds 

to bound and protect organic molecules from mineralization; (ii) the low ?G activity, which seems 

to be repressed by Al and Fe compounds, affecting the rate of the OC mineralization; (iii) the high 

demand of energy for P acquisition due to the intense Pi retention on the Al and Fe compounds,

1 - Introduction 

The exponential growth of the world population observed in the last century led to a 

progressive need of food and fibers, which has been tentatively supported mainly by the increasing 

of crop yields per hectare (FAO, 2009; van Bavel, 2013), since agricultural areas are becoming 

scarce and poor, due to inadequate management practices. Nevertheless, the inappropriate use of 

the agricultural soils and overuse of the production factors, such as chemical fertilizers, animal 

manure and pesticides (Quansah, 2010), have led to environmental problems, namely soil and water 

quality depletion, and air contamination (Savci, 2012). 

The nutrient dynamics in the agro-ecosystems is a function of integrative effects of soil 

nutrients transformations, availability, soil management, rhizosphere, microorganisms and plant 

biological processes (Sinsabaugh, 1994). Over the history, mankind learned to maximize 

agronomical yields through the use of animal manures and other natural residues, without relying 

only on the native properties and quality of the soil. From the beginning of last century, the use of 

chemical fertilizers became the prime resource of nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) 

and potassium (K) in the form of salts, since they could give a greater and faster response to the 

requirements of the progressively more productive crop systems (Savci, 2012). Nevertheless, this 

policy has induced to the misuse of the synthetic fertilizers, most often without any technical and 

economic justifications, leading to the severe environmental problems detected during the final of 

the century and leading to the present societal concerns (Aggani, 2013). Therefore, it is clear the 

importance of the knowledge and implementation of agriculture management practices without 

causing damage on other ecosystems (Önder et al., 2011) and how to recover from the abuse of 

production factors from the past (Giovannucci et al., 2012). 

1.1 - Phosphorus (P) 

Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for crop production, since it is a component of 

several fundamental biochemical molecules such as DNA, RNA, ATP, NADPH and phospholipids 

(Santos, 2015). Moreover, research attention has been given to P, since it is a nonrenewable 

resource (Cordell et al., 2009). In nature, P as its origin through the weathering process of soil 

minerals, such as apatite and other geologically stable materials (Lindsay et al., 1989). Phosphorus 

is the 11th most abundant element in the earth’s crust and it is at the center of serious environmental 



   Chapter 1 - Introduction

issues as the depletion of the available reserves and the decline of fresh water quality. This non-

renewable resource is confined to small areas in the planet, and although new reserves have been 

discovered, is still lacking the evaluation of its quality and feasibility as raw material for the 

fertilizer industry (Sharpley et al., 2001). 

Efficient P absorption and acquisition by crop is essential to achieve a desired crop yield. 

So, maintaining a proper P content in soils enhances plant P efficient uptake from the rhizosphere 

by an integrative morphological and physiological root adaptive strategies (Cabrera, 2005). The 

amount of P required to be uptaken by plants may not be are immediately available on the soil. 

Therefore, the low soil P availability is a limiting factor for crop production in many of the soils, 

which is aggravated by the P fixation into soils components, which leads to slow diffusion rates in 

soil solution. Mineral P fertilizers and animal manure application improve P availability and crop 

yield (Schröder et al., 2010), but may lead to environmental consequences in several ecosystems, 

such has freshwater eutrophication (Daniel et al., 1998). Consequently, maintaining the 

concentration of P in the soil solution in an adequate range for plant uptake, often cited as &gt; 0.2 

mg L-1, while restricting P content in surface waters below 0.03 mg L-1, is a challenge faced by 

those involved in soil and crop nutrition management (Pierzynski et al., 2005). 

1.2 - Soil P Cycle  

Several inorganic and biological processes are involved in P cycling, as it is shown in Figure 

1.1. Orthophosphate (PO4
3-) is the major form of P in soils, and is present on a content ranging 

from 100 to 3000 mg P kg-1 (Frossard et al., 1995). Generally, the bioavailable orthophosphate ions 

are present either as HPO4
2- (pH &gt; 7.2) and H2PO4

- (pH 4.0 - 7.2) (Pierzynski et al., 2005). Aiming 

to reduce the consumption of chemical P fertilizer and their environmental impacts, several 

practices are needed to be thoughtful implemented, such as maximizing exploitation of the 

biological potential of root/rhizosphere processes for efficient mobilization and acquisition of soil 

P by plants, as well the P recycling from manures and other residues (Sharpley and Beegle, 2001). 

Therefore, a holistic understanding of P dynamics in soil is necessary for a better P management 

and maximization on the P-use efficiency.

in soil ecosystem and pathways of P loss into superficial freshwaters and subterranean waters, adapted from Pierzynski 

et al. (2005). 

Inorganic processes of the P cycle involve several physical and chemical phenomenas like 

precipitation/dissolution and sorption/desorption. Biological processes involve primarily uptake by 

higher plant and microorganisms of dissolved P released for soil solution during the weathering 

fenomenon of primary or secondary minerals. The inorganical P (Pi) forms are cycled through 

several processes in a complex food chain via a serie of mineralization and immobilization 

reactions (Frossard et al., 1995). The proportion of organic P (Po) varys between 30 to 65% of the 

soil total P (Pt), but in grassland pastures the proportion is normaly higher than 50% (Nash et al., 

2014) and in soils rich organic matter (SOM), the Po contribution may reach up to 90% (Harrison, 

1987). Plant P uptake is the primary pathway through which P is removed from soil, although 

surface leaching, runoff and erosion are also pathways for P losses into other environmental 

compartments, while gaseous losses do not occurs (Pierzynski et al., 2005).

1.2.1 - Soil P forms 

As referred, soil P is usually distinguished between inorganic and organic forms (Santos, 

2015). Soil Pi forms are governed by precipitation, dissolution and sorption/desorption processes 

and chemical equilibriums. Generally, Pi has low solubility, is easily fixed and, consequently, it is 

relatively immobile in soil. Its molecular chemistry is determined by the ionic bonds to the 

surrounding atoms and it is the relative strength of these ionic bonds that explains how P behaves 

in soil (Doolette and Smernik, 2011). Soil Po may be also affected by precipitation, dissolution and 

sorption. Po forms have one or more covalent bonds to a C atom, generally via an ester linkage 

(through an oxygen atom). Therefore, the majority of Po transformations, in particular their 

conversion to Pi, requires the covalent bond breaking (Berg and Joern, 2006).  

The differentiation between Pi and Po forms is easy to make using long-established chemical 

techniques. Nevertheless, this differentiation is only a simplification of soil P speciation, because 

each of these groups comprise a huge range of chemical P forms. Pi is traditionally detected 

spectrophotometrically by molecular absorption as a blue-colored phosphomolybdenum complex, 

formed when free phosphate anions react with an acidified molybdate reagent (Murphy and Riley 

method). Because Po does not form a colored complex with that reagent, it can be only determined 

as the difference between the total P (measured as Pi after a soil extract digestion) and the readily 

Pi (Doolette and Smernik, 2011). 

1.2.1.1 - Inorganic P and chemical/physical processes 

Pi exists as primary and secondary solid P phases or adsorbed onto soil minerals, being well 

established its propensity to be precipitated or to be bounded on existing solid phases, according 

to the several chemical equilibriums that are established in soil solution (Lindsay, 1979). The 

majority of soil P minerals, which are divided in two groups, exist in the form of amorphous co-

precipitates, with different degrees of substitution. 

Primary P minerals 

The group of stoichiometric apatites, Ca10(X)(PO4)6, where X represents F
-, Cl-, OH-, or 

CO3
2-, is the most common and abundant primary P mineral on earth crust, and its weathering is 

the first step of P cycling (Frossard et al., 1995). There are also some forms of apatites in soils 



   Chapter 1 - Introduction 

6 

 

known as non-stoichiometric, where part of the Ca is substituted Na+, K+, Mg2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Fe3+ or 

PO4
3- is substituted by HPO4

2-, CO3
2-, AsO3

2- or VO4
3-, which present higher solubility products 

than stoichiometric apatites (Bengtsson et al., 2009). In calcareous environments apatites are very 

stable, requiring a H+ source to supply Ca and P for soil solution. For that reason, in soils with pH 

above 6.2, rock phosphate have no agronomical usefulness due to its reduced P availability for crop 

uptake (Daniel et al., 1998 and Fardeau et al., 1988). 

Secondary P minerals 

These minerals are the reactions products between soluble P and Al, Fe or Ca. In calcareous 

soils, after an initial absorption of P onto the surface of calcite, calcium phosphates can be formed 

by precipitation, in a chain of composts, depending on the abundance of Ca. Monocalcium 

phosphate precipitates, and then transforms to dicalcium phosphate, to octocalcium 

(Ca8H2(PO4)6.5H2O) and finally to hydroxyapatite, and the mineral having the lowest solubility 

should ultimately control the concentration of P in the soil solution, while the intermediate 

precipitates are unlikely to persist in soils (Frossard et al., 1995). With the exception of the mono 

and dicalcium phosphates, all the others have low solubility and reduced P availability for plant 

uptake (Pierzynsk et al., 2005; Santos 2015). 

In acid and well drained soils, the presence of Al and Fe cations, leads to the P precipitation 

in the form of Al or Fe-phosphates. In these conditions, variscite (AlPO4.2H2O) and stregite 

(FePO4.2H2O) are the main phosphate forms, but vivianite (Fe3(PO4)2.8H2O) is dominant in 

hydromorphic soils (Morel, 1996). Nevertheless, the abundant presence of amorphous oxides-Al 

or Fe can lead to occlusion, becoming difficult to identify the P-Al and P-Fe minerals (Pierzynsk 

et al., 2005). 

Sorbed P 

The behavior phosphate anions in soil is mediated by soil colloids that play a major role in 

its availability to crop uptake (Guppy et al., 2005). Adsorption occurs when P accumulates and 

bonds onto the surface of soil solid constituents, and desorption is the diffusion of sorbed P into 

the soil solution (Sposito, 1986). Regarding sorption, the process is considered as a continuous 

sequence of adsorption and precipitation and consists of two processes: (i) a reversible adsorption, 



   Chapter 1 - Introduction 

7 

 

which is relatively fast and (ii) a relatively slow, practically irreversible precipitation-like process 

being very difficult to distinguish between the two of them (van der Zee and van Riemsdijk, 1988). 

By replacing H2O or OH
-, P is sorbed onto Al and Fe hydrous oxides, clay minerals and carbonates 

surfaces and edges (Corey, 1981) and sorption and desorption reactions tend to equilibrate with 

soil P solution. On a P-rich environment, when the solubility product constants are exceeded due 

to over fertilizations, sorption can evolve into precipitation as secondary P solid phases previously 

referred (Pierzynsk et al., 2005). 

Pi in soil solution 

The proportion and form of Pi is governed by soil pH (Figure 1.2). In acidic conditions, the 

H2PO4
- anion is the form dominant and when the pH arises, HPO4

2- anion form is dominant (Santos, 

2015). Due to the prevailing pH values of agricultural soils, P in the forms of PO4
3- anion or H3PO4 

molecule are not expected to exist in soil solution. 

 

Figure 1.2 - Soil solution pH effect on the phosphate ions proportions (adapted from Hinsinger, 2001). 

1.2.1.2 - Organic P and biological processes 

Defined as a P bonded to a C, it may represent nearly 90 % of total P in soils very rich in 

SOM (Harrison, 1987). Organic P transformations in soil are important for P availability, 

determining the productivity of ecosystems (Condron et al., 2005). P is absorbed from soil solution 

by plant and microorganism, and bonds to C through phosphorylation by different biochemical 



   Chapter 1 - Introduction 

8 

 

pathways. Therefore, Po has its primary origin in animal and plant residues, but it is also 

synthesized by microbes and released to the soil after its death. In nature, Po remains at its highest 

oxidation state, forming always covalent bonds (Goldwhite, 1981). 

Several studies have demonstrated that Po forms contribute significantly to plant P uptake. 

Oehl et al. (2001), in Swiss arable soils, reported that Po mineralization rate was equivalent to soil 

solution P, indicating that soil P mineralization is a significant process in delivering available Pi. 

The amount, forms and dynamic of organic P are determined by the combination of biological, 

chemical and physical factors, and influenced by environmental parameters and soils management, 

as represented in Figure 1.3 (Condron et al., 2005). 

Organic P forms 

Although representing only a small part of the total Po, organic phosphorus compounds in soils 

can be divide in tree groups (Morel, 1996): 

? Inositol phosphates, widely resistant to mineralization, and may represent up to 50% of 

total organic P; 

? Phospholipids and glycerophospholipids, representing between 0.5 to 7% of total organic 

P; 

? Nucleic acids, and derived compounds, representing up to 3% of soil organic P. 



   Chapter 1 - Introduction

Figure 1.3 - Soil organic P dynamic (adapted from Condron et al., 2005). 

The methods used to study these fraction are divided in two groups: one group measures 

the total concentrations of Po; other group includes methods to identify the chemical forms Po, their 

concentrations and behavior in soil, such as bonding and mineralization fluxes (Condron et al., 

2005). In the latter methods, important advances have been made with the use of layer 

chromatography, anion exchange high performance chromatography, gas chromatography, mass 

spectroscopy and 31P NMR spectroscopy (Turner and Mckelvie, 2002). 

Phosphorus immobilization/mineralization  

The immobilization/mineralization rate determine the P turnover in soils (Condron et al., 2005). 

The conversion of Pi to Po is a biological process designated as immobilization, occurring via two 

important pathways (Condron and Goh, 1989): 

? To supply microbial biomass requirements, Pi is removed from soil solution (Figure 1.3), 

returning into the soil as Po after cell death and lysis. A net immobilization of Pi by microbes 



   Chapter 1 - Introduction 

10 

 

is expected to prevail over mineralization when soil C/P ratio is above 300 (Stevenson and 

Cole, 1999). 

? To supply crop requirements, Pi is removed from soil solution by plant uptake (Figure 1.3), 

returning to the soil as Po in litter and root debris, or as animal manure and feaces. When 

grassland pastures are subjected to fertilization, a net immobilization occurs, although an 

equilibrium is established between Po inputs and mineralization, leading to a decline of 

organic P accumulation (Condron et al., 2005). 

Regarding P mineralization, it can be defined as the inverse process of immobilization, since is 

the conversion of Po into Pi. Phosphorus is released from soil organic matter or during the 

decomposition process of microbial and plant residues (Condron et al., 2005). The Po 

mineralization is mediate by a large group of phosphatases, which are periplasmic or extracellular 

enzymes, also designated as exoenzymes or ecoenzymes (Frossard et al., 2000). 

1.3 - Enzymes 

Soil organic matter complex is both synthesized and degraded by soil microbial activity 

(Burns et al., 2013). The balance between these two processes determinates several soil properties, 

such as: (i) carbon sequestration; (ii) soil aggregation structure and stability; (ii) plant nutrient 

availability and; (iii) water retention. Microbial diversity and activity host the enzyme production 

that also determine soil fertility and crop productivity (Burns et al., 2013).  

The enzymes produced and exuded by plant roots, mycorrhizae, and microorganisms occurs 

according to the nutrient demand and nutrient availability in soils (Sinsabaugh, 1994). Being 

considered the proximate agents of soil organic matter decomposition, enzymes disrupts plant and 

microbial cell walls and reduce macromolecules to soluble substrates for posterior uptake and 

assimilation (Dick et al., 1988). 

In nature, natural selection leads to enzyme production strategies that minimize costs to the 

cell and maximize the associated benefits. The costs to the cells are the carbon and nutrients 

required for energy (i.e. ATP), enzyme synthesis and secretion, formation and organization of 

membrane transporters for the uptake of the products, and signal production and detection of 

potential substrates. Therefore, exoenzyme activities are the result of cellular economics: 



   Chapter 1 - Introduction 

11 

 

expending resources to produce enzymes versus the benefit of increases on low molecular mass 

organics molecules, with consequences in terms of availability of assimilable mineral nutrients and 

energy sources (Burns et al., 2013).  

1.3.1 - ?-Glucosidase 

Glucosidases, or glucoside hydrolases, is the general designation used to describe a group 

of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of different glucosides. Widely distributed in nature, they 

are detected in microorganisms, animals and plants (Eivazi and Tabatabai, 1988), being also 

reported their free existence in soils (Skujins, 1976).  

Considerable concern has been given to the synthesis, role, and properties of these enzymes 

in microorganisms and plants. Nevertheless, only more recently the attention has been also devoted 

to studies regarding their role in soils. Glucosidase reaction products are important energy sources 

for soil microorganism, playing a major role in the degradation of carbohydrates (Eivazi and 

Tabatabai, 1988). Its synthesis is induced by the products of cellulose breakdown, including 

cellobiose, glucose and their metabolites (Stewart and Leatherwood, 1976), and its activity has 

been referred as the rate-limiting step in cellulose degradation (Alef and Nannipieri, 1995). 

Objectively, glucosidases catalyze the cleavage of one molecule of cellobiose in two molecules of 

glucose, regulating the energy supply for microorganisms, which are unable to take up cellobiose 

directly. 

?-glucosidase (?G) is the most abundant and easily detectable of the three enzymes (endo-

1,4-glucanase, exo-1,4-glucanase and ?-D-glucosidase) involved in cellulose degradation in soil. 

Rarely substrate limited, it is considered ideal to examine the importance of physico-chemical 

controls on the turnover of soil organic matter (Turner et al., 2002). Therefore, ?G activity has been 

used to closely monitor rapid changes in soil organic C associated with soil management effects 

(Bandick and Dick, 1999).  

1.3.2 - Phosphatases 

Mineralization of Po may be enzymatic (Figure1.3), and this has stimulated much of the 

attention in phosphatases activity in soils, microorganisms, and plant roots. Phosphatases are a 



   Chapter 1 - Introduction 

12 

 

broad group of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of both esters and anhydrides of phosphoric 

acid (Schmidt and Laskowski, 1961). 

Like other exoenzyme molecule, phosphatases diffuse poorly into the soil matrix (Lefebvre et 

al., 1990) and their activity are dependent of different parameters such as soil characteristics, clay 

and humus adsorption, microorganisms, plant cover, inputs and the presence of inhibitors or 

activators (Speir and Ross, 1978). There are three types of phosphatases in soils, all of them acting 

on ester bonds (Deng and Tabatabai, 1997): 

? Phosphomonoesterases, a group that includes acid phosphatases and alkaline phosphatases; 

both of them are phosphoric monoester hydrolases with optimal activities in acid and 

alkaline environments. These enzymes catalyze the break of the ester bond of the 

orthophosphate group to a C. Phytic acid, mononucleotides such as adenosine-5’-

phosphate, or sugars such as glucose-6-phosphate, are some of the molecules which Po is 

hydrolyzed by these groups of enzymes. 

? Phosphodiesterases are phosphoric diester hydrolases. These enzymes catalyze the break 

of a diester bond, orthophosphate group to two C. Ribonucleic and deoxyribonucleic acids 

or phospholipids, such as phosphatidyl inositol, are some of the molecules which Po is 

hydrolyzed by these enzymes 

? Phosphotriesterases are phosphoric triester hydrolases. These enzymes catalyze the break 

of a triester bond to an orthophosphate. Phosphotriesters have not been found in nature 

(Saxena, 2008) and they are a class of highly toxic synthetic compounds known as 

organophosphates, widely used as insecticides and herbicides (Bigley and Raushel, 2013). 

The activity of these enzyme is determinant in the soil P cycling and on the microbial and plant 

nutrition (Tabatabai and Dick, 2002), by catalyzing mineralization of Po and contributing to soil P 

bioavailability. 

1.4 - Resource allocation for P acquisition 

Once released from cells, enzyme activity is mediated by environmental factors (Allison, 

2006), although their expression is regulated by environmental signals (Dick et al., 2011), which 

in soils are related with the nutrient availability and net resources (Moro et al., 2015). The 



   Chapter 1 - Introduction 

13 

 

extracellular enzyme degradation of organic matter can be seen as a rate-controlling step of Carbon 

cycle, which requires a large number of hydrolytic and oxidative reactions, stoichiometric-linked 

to the composition and oxidation state of organic matter. Enzyme activities can relate microbial 

biomass and organic matter to the nutrient assimilation and growth stoichiometry (Sinsabaugh and 

Moorhead, 1994).  

?-Glucosidase and other cellulolytic enzymes activities are correlated with microbial 

metabolism and the rate of mass loss from plant litter (Sinsabaugh and Moorhead, 1994). Although 

their magnitude and correlation vary widely in the terrestrial ecosystems when relating to organic 

matter and available Pi, phosphomonoesterases activity presents an inverse relationship with 

available Pi, being one of the most studied extracellular enzyme (Sinsabaugh and Shah, 2012). 

Describing different enzymatic activities, such as ?G and acid phosphatase (AP), in relation to 

edaphoclimatic factors, Sinsabaugh et al. (2008) reported that enzymes activities were related to 

soil pH and that hydrolytic activities reflected nutrient availability trends.  

 Sinsabaugh et al. (2010) proposed that the exoenzymes activities are consequence of 

stoichiometry and metabolism aspects, as result of the equilibrium among microbial biomass, 

organic matter, efficiency of nutrient assimilation and growth. Latter, the same authors (Sinsabaugh 

and Shah, 2011) presented a conceptual model linking organic matter to exoenzime activities 

stoichiometry. Moreover, enzymatic activities can be related among them, since they are 

stoichiometric-linked to the nutrient availability and acquisition by microbial biomass. So, enzyme 

activity ratios in soils can be understood as a complemental index of potential nutrient limitation 

for growth (Moro et al., 2015), since energy resources are allocated to supplemental exoenzyme 

production only if labile forms of substrate (P or N) are in short supply (Allison et al., 2007), 

leading to a shift in energy consumption from cell growth towards nutrient acquisition . 

Moreover, Sinsabaugh and Moorhead (1994) and Sinsabaugh and Shah (2012) proposed a 

resource allocation model for extracellular enzymes in relation to nutrient availability, in which the 

ratio of a certain nutrient acquiring enzyme activity to C acquiring enzyme activity (?G) would 

become an indicator of the availability of such nutrient. If related with crops, this proposal may 

become a complement to the conventional laboratorial approaches to assess nutrients availabilities 

in soils.

1.5 - Phosphorus Inputs/Outputs 

The P cycle has been described, in Ecology, as a 'tight cycle', since the P amount present 

within an ecosystem itself (in the soil and microbial and vegetal biomass) is much larger when 

compared to the gains and losses of the ecosystem (Newman, 1995). In agricultural systems, the P 

input has begun with the use of organic materials (Figure 1.4), as referred previously. However, 

after the middle of 1800, with the advances in plant nutrition by Justus von Liebig, and after the 

late 1800, with the advent of the fertilizer industry, precisely with the calcium superphosphate 

manufacturing, the inputs of Pi in the agricultural systems increased continuously till nowadays. 

Fertilization affects soil biochemical and biological properties (Liang et al., 2014), and the 

influence of external nutrient inputs on soil microbial ecology has been frequently emphasized (Ai 

et al., 2012). As an example, PO4
3- anions are a competitive inhibitor of both phosphatases in soils 

(Juma and Tabatabai, 1978), although the absence of response of phosphatase activities to P 

addition has been also reported (Schneider et al., 2001). On the other hand, N fertilization generally 

increases the activity of phosphatases in soils (Marklein and Houlton, 2012). 

 

Figure 1.4 - Scheme synthetizing the soil P Input and Outputs. 

Due to its low mobility, solubility and concentration in soil solution, P leads to limit the net 

production in a continuous agriculture land use (Frossard et al., 1995). Therefore, the application 

of fertilizers and by-products containing P to soils has the main purpose to increase the bioavailable 

phosphorus in soil solution, to supply plants requirements (Hedley and McLaughlin, 2005), and 



   Chapter 1 - Introduction 

15 

 

remove P crop starvation. To be effective, the fertilizer P need to be more soluble than the existent 

soils phosphorus compounds (Hedley and McLaughlin, 2005). 

Animal manures, crop residues, municipal and industrial wastes and other residues are often 

called by-products, since they converge diverse mixtures that includes Pi and Po at different stages 

of decomposition, potentially acting in a similar manner as mineral P fertilizers (Hedley and 

McLaughlin, 2005). Although by-products efficiency is also affected by soil components, such as 

Al, Fe and Ca, their fate is usually a function of the microbial decomposition rate (Hedley and 

McLaughlin, 2005). 

The rate of organic matter accumulation in terrestrial systems is directly related to their net 

primary productivity and subsequent rate of organic matter return to soil (Grace et al., 1998). 

Relationships are found between soil organic matter accumulation and P fertilizer use when these 

inputs regulate the net primary productivity of the system (Simpson et al., 2011). Accumulation of 

Po in the range of 1.7 to 4 kg ha
-1 yr-1 were recorded for pastures on low P available soils (Kohn et 

al., 1977). 

The accumulation of P in soil it is not inevitable, and is extremely influenced by the farming 

system and management practices (Simpson et al., 2011). Agricultural P applications may be 

adjusted in order to maintain soil bioavailability in a steady state or the returning rate of Po to the 

soil may be stabilize provide that primary productivity is stabilized. Nevertheless, in many of the 

agricultural systems, bioavailable P exceeds the agronomical threshold value for plant growth as a 

result of over fertilization practices. In other situations, organic matter and Po continues to 

accumulate in soils, either because the capacity of the soil to retain organic matter is not yet 

achieved, or a balance between the input of plant residues and the rate of mineralization was not 

reached (Baldock et al., 2007).  

Another important part of the P cycle (Figure 1.1) is the transfer of P from soils into 

watersheds. When not enhanced by the misuse of fertilizers, the runoff flux needs to be considered 

as a natural process. Similarly, erosion is a natural process in the watersheds, but its intensity is 

also enhanced by inadequate soil management practices. In both situations, the increase of P 

enrichment on the receiving waters contributes to the decrease of its quality (Sharpley et al., 2003). 



   Chapter 1 - Introduction

1.6 - Phosphorus environmental impacts 

Being an essential element for plants and animals and required to achieve profitable yield 

of crop and livestock production, P increases also the biological productivity of surface waters. As 

a result, escalation on water eutrophication accelerates the natural aging of lakes and streams 

(Sharpley and Beegle, 2001). 

Water eutrophication is the biological enrichment of surface waters due to anthropogenic 

inputs of nutrients (Kleinman et al., 2009). Since P is the one of the limiting factor for algal growth, 

the increase on agricultural P inputs has been associated with the eutrophication of freshwaters 

systems (Sharpley and Menzel, 1988). The P transfer to surface waters is defined as a nonpoint-

source pollution of lakes and streams and promotes eutrophication at concentration levels between 

0.02 and 0.035 mg P L-1 (Daniel et al., 1998). The transfer intensity from soil to waters depends on 

the P desorption from soil constituents. Therefore, sorption by hydroxides and oxides of Al and Fe 

in surface horizons and subsoils or precipitation with Ca can maintain runoff and leached P levels 

below the eutrophication thresholds values (Elliott et al., 1999). 

Nevertheless, the growing concerns about water eutrophication and the misuse of P 

fertilizers lead to the urgent need for restrictions in P losses from agricultural soils to water and to 

the development of decision support systems to assess and anticipate the risks of those P transfers 

(Daniel et al.,  1998). 

Van der Zee et al. (1988) proposed a parameter named Degree of P Saturation (DPS), expressed 

as the ratio between the total amount of sorbed P and the P Sorption Capacity (PSC) of the soil. 

Under these concepts, the PSC is a measure of the potential P sorption by the major P-sorbing 

components in acid soils matrix: the organic Al and Fe complexes and the poorly crystalline Al 

and Fe hydroxides and oxides (Freese et al., 1992): 

??? =  
???

???
 × 100        Eq. 1  

??? =  ? (???? +  ????  )       Eq. 2  

where ? = 0.5 and Alox, Feox and Pox are expressed in mmol kg
-1. 



   Chapter 1 - Introduction 

17 

 

DPS relates the P sorbed to PSC, and the increase of P content in a specific soil leads to the 

increase of DPS. Therefore, P enrichment forwards to the loss of soil ability to remove extra P from 

soil solution due to the buildup equilibrium of P sorbed relative to PSC, driving to situations where 

P can be readily loss by superficial runoff and internal leaching (Kleinman et al., 1999). A DPS 

value of 25% is considered critical, above which P leaching is susceptible to occur (van der Zee et 

al., 1988). However, for acid sandy soils in Flanders, a critical limit of 35 % was set, and soils with 

values below 25% were classified as unsaturated (De Bolle et al., 2013).  

Other methods of assessing the risk of P loss to water are based on standard soil P test 

(SPT), as Mehlich-3, Olsen, ammonium lactate methods, iron oxide–coated paper strips and P-

water extraction (Pote et al., 1999). As an example, Horta and Torrent (2007) evaluated the ability 

of Olsen P method to predict the P release from Portuguese acid soils into waters, achieving an 

environmental threshold value of 50 mg P kg-1. Tentatively, an equivalent threshold value for P-

ammonium lactate method may be set to 106 mg P kg-1 for the same type of soils (Horta et al, 

2010). Both values may be considered as a change point, above which P losses to receiving waters 

became unacceptably high. Nevertheless, these values depend not only on the amount of 

extractable P, but also on the soil type and desorption situation (Maguire et al., 2005), drawbacks 

that may be overcame by the use of DPS index. 

 Torrent and Delgado (2001) proposed another P desorption approach, where different 

soil:solution rations mimic various scenarios of soil P desorption to water. According to those 

authors, 1:100, 1:1000 and 1:10000 soil: CaCl2 solution ratios would mimic respectively P 

desorption for drainage and runoff waters and P desorption from sediments to static waterbodies. 

Within this approach, critical values are (i) 0.1 mg P L-1 for drainage water (EU-WFD, 2000); (ii) 

0.05 mg P L-1 for water runoff (Golterman and Oude, 1991) and; 0.02-0.03 mg P L-1 for static 

waterbodies (Correll, 1999). 

1.7 - Volcanic ash soils 

Soils derived from volcanic materials, also known as Andosols (WRB, 2006), are formed 

from volcanic ash and cinder deposits. These soils are very light and fluffy, with a high capacity to 

retain water, and are rich in amorphous minerals, such as allophones and imogolite that form strong 



   Chapter 1 - Introduction

bonds with organic colloids and P (Shoji et al., 1993; Takahashi and Shoji, 2002). Andosols account 

for nearly 1% of the global land area, but they contain approximately 5% of the global soil organic 

carbon (Eswaran et al., 1993; Batjes, 1996), since these soils tend to accumulate OM in the 

superficial layers (Takahashi and Shoji, 2002; Dahlgren et al., 2004). On the other hand, cultivated 

Andosols need to be fertilized periodically due to its high capacity to sorb P, in order to supply crop 

requirements (Shoji et al., 1993). 

1.8 - The Azores archipelago, the Pico island case 

According to WRB (2006), most of the soils in the Azores archipelago, including Pico 

island, have been classified as Andosols, showing unique properties as defined by their main 

physical, chemical and mineralogical characteristics (Pinheiro et al., 2001). Simultaneously, 

eutrophication has been reported in several lakes of the Azores, despite the adoption of several 

measures included on the European Union Water-Framework Directive (Cruz et al., 2015).  

In S. Miguel Island, Sete-Cidades watershed, Simões (2001) reported values of DPS and 

Pi-Olsen higher than the threshold values. Also on the same island, but in Furnas watershed, Fontes 

and Pinheiro (2016) in studies being conducted presently, observed up to 0.19 mg P L-1 in runoff 

waters, above the environmental threshold value of 0.05 mg L-1. 

In Pico island, about 40 % of the territory is dedicated to dairy livestock, and several 

watersheds have been identified as under environmental risk and P fertilization practices in grazed 

pastures are associated to those risks (SRAM, 2011). Some examples are the Lagoas Capitão, 

Rosado and Peixinho, where the watersheds are under significant pressure due to the water low 

quality of the waterbodies (SRAM, 2011).

Objectives 

Taking into consideration many of the aspects referred in this introduction, a study was 

conducted, using six fertilized grassland soils collected in from commercial farms from Pico island. 

In each soil, the top 15 cm were sampled and divided in five layers. In terms of presentation, the 

work is divided in two parts, which represent the two main chapters of this dissertation. 

In chapter 2, the main objectives were (i) to evaluate the vertical distribution of different Pi 

pools and (ii) to assess the potential risk of P losses from the soils to the receiving waters, using 

the established chemical parameters referred previously: DPS and P desorption in CaCl2 

suspensions with high soil:solution ratios. 

In chapter 3, the main objectives were (i) to evaluate the vertical distribution of ?G and AP 

activities in the 15 cm layer of the studied soils, (ii) to assess the stoichiometric enzymatic ratio 

and effort for P acquisition in soils derived from volcanic materials, and (iii) stablishing the 

relationship between these enzymes activities, the mineral P fertilization, SOM accumulation and 

the active Al and Fe extracted by ammonium oxalate.

2.1 - Abstract  

Eutrophication of receiving waters due to non-point pollution, such as the use of inorganic 

Phosphorus (P) fertilizers in agricultural systems, is a detected problem, in the archipelago of Azores, where 

the main agricultural system is grassland pastures installed in soils derived from volcanic material and with 

high P retention capacity. 

The aim of the present work was to study the potential contribution of these soils to the risks of P 

losses to waters. One Haplic Andosol, two Placic Andosols and three Vitric Andosols annually fertilized 

with mineral P were sampled and stratified in five layers (0-1, 1-2, 2-5, 5-10 and 10-15 cm). The distribution 

of different P pools and risk of P loading into receiving waters was assessed by the following analytical 

criteria: inorganic (Pi) and organic P (Po), P-Olsen (Pi-Olsen), P-ammonium lactate (P-AL), P-CaCl2, degree 

of phosphorus saturation (DPS) and P concentration on the equilibrium solution of soils in 0.01M CaCl2 

with ratios of 1: 100, 1: 1000 and 1: 10000. 

The assessed P pools presented in general a decreasing gradient along the soil depth. A P 

accumulation of 3.7 g Pt kg
-1 on the average of the superficial layers (0-1 and 1-2 cm) suggests 

overfertilization. The Po and Pi contents represent about 54 and 46 % of total P, respectively, Placic and 

Haplic Andosols having a higher Po contribution, and Vitric Andosols a higher Pi contribution. The Placic 

and Haplic Andosols present higher organic carbon (OC), Alox and Feox (oxalate extractable) contents than 

the Vitric Andosols, although Alox and Feox values have showed an increase with depth in both soil groups. 

The Vitric Andosols the highest extractable Pi contents assessed by all the extraction methods used, but 

presented the lowest extractable Po values evaluated by the Olsen method. 

Although the Pi-Olsen, P-AL and P-CaCl2 results were above the agronomical threshold values, 

none of the soils presented DPS values above 25 %. On average, Vitric Andosols presented higher values 

(14.1 %) than Placic and Haplic Andosols (6.6 %).  

Regarding the assessment of the desorbed P with 0.01M CaCl2 soil electrolyte solution as mimicking 

condition for P in drainage (1: 100), runoff (1: 1000) and static waterbodies (1: 10000), the values 

determined were in all soils below the respective critical limits, 0.1, 0.05 and 0.02-3 mg P L-1. Although 

showing Pi contents above the agronomical threshold for maximum yield, the results indicate that soil Pi is 

still below the environmental thresholds. Therefore, P desorption from soils do not seem to be the main 

source for waterbodies eutrophication. Since inorganic fertilizers are superficially applied, it must be 

considered (i) the hypothesis of their direct runoff during rainfall events, before complete dissolution and 

interaction with soil matrix, and (ii), the fertilizer application with deep-banding systems in longer periods 

of time as an alternative to the interdiction of the use of fertilizers on the most sensitive and hilly areas of 

the watersheds. 

 

Key words: Eutrophication; Soil P losses; Degree of Phosphorus Saturation; Andosols.

2.2 - Introduction   

Phosphorus (P) is a natural limiting nutrient for plant development, being generally recycled 

and retained efficiently due to P-fixing capacity of the soil (Sinaj et al., 2002). The application of 

mineral P or animal manure as fertilizer to soil is a common practice to achieve high yields, but the 

accumulation and subsequent transfer of P from soil to ground and surface water may be reached 

if P is applied in amounts that largely exceed plant needs. Eutrophication of receiving waters caused 

by P transfer from the soil is defined as a non-point source pollution (Sharpley et al., 1994). 

Water eutrophication is a worldwide environmental problem, related to high nutrients 

concentration in aquatic systems. The transfer of P to surface waters can promote eutrophication at 

concentration levels between 0.02 and 0.035 mg P L-1 (Daniel et al., 1998). The process and amount 

of transfer from soil to waters depends on the P desorption from soil constituents. In soils, sorption 

by hydroxides and oxides of Al and Fe in surface horizons and subsoils or precipitation with 

calcium can maintain leachate P levels below the eutrophication thresholds (Elliott et al., 1999), 

and P leaching is not generally considered as a groundwater problem. However, in P enriched soils, 

P leaching may become a serious risk for the environment (De Bolle et al., 2013). Usually, runoff 

is the main process involved in the P transport associated to nonpoint sources of water pollution 

(Parry, 1998). The intensive use of inorganic and organic fertilizers is responsible for a nutrient 

accumulation, mainly at the soil surface (Sharpley et al., 2001), especially in no-till systems (Laflen 

and Tabatabai, 1984), namely in grazed pastures.  Therefore, the soil surface nutrient enrichment 

increases the potential for nutrient loss by runoff (Sharpley et al., 1991). Timing of manure and 

mineral fertilizer application relative to runoff event plays a key role in the magnitude of P losses 

(Westerman and Overcash, 1980). Immediately following application of P to the soil, its loss 

potential sharply increases and then declines over time, as applied P interacts with the soil 

components and is converted from soluble to recalcitrant forms (Edwards and Daniel, 1993). 

However, losses are also related to other factors such as characteristics of the P source, intensity of 

the rainfall events (Kleinman et al., 2002, 2006) and the period between application and rainfall.  

As the demand for improved water quality increases, the use of pastures and the associated 

decrease in nutrient loss through soil erosion may become a more attractive land use on dairy farms 

(Rotz et al., 2009). Therefore, there is a need to document the potential water quality impact of 



Chapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures 

30 

 

pastures and to estimate this impact relative to other land uses. Significant research to monitor N 

and P loss in runoff from grazed pasture have been conducted, however to a lesser extent when 

compared to nutrient loss from cultivated cropland (Vadas et al., 2015). 

Various approaches have been used to estimate the environmental risk induced by soil P 

desorption. Van der Zee et al. (1988) proposed the ‘‘Degree of P Saturation’’ (DPS), expressed as 

the ratio between the amount of P desorbed from the soil and the soil P Sorption Capacity (PSC), 

as estimated by ammonium oxalate extraction. The PSC is a measure of the potential P sorption by 

the major P-sorbing components in acid soils matrix: the organic Al and Fe complexes and the 

poorly crystalline Al and Fe hydroxides and oxides (Freese et al., 1992). DPS relates the P sorbed 

to PSC, and the increase of P content in a specific soil leads to the increase of DPS. Therefore, P 

enrichment forwards to the loss of soil ability to remove extra P from soil solution due to the 

buildup equilibrium of P sorbed relative to PSC, driving to situations where P can be readily loss 

by superficial runoff and internal leaching (Kleinman et al., 1999). A DPS value of 25 % is 

considered critical, above which P leaching is susceptible to occur (van der Zee et al., 1988). 

However, for acid sandy soils in Flanders, a critical limit of 35 % was set, and soils with values 

below 25 % were classified as unsaturated (De Bolle et al., 2013). 

Other methods of assessing the risk of P loss to water are based on standard soil P test 

(SPT), as Mehlich-3, Olsen, iron oxide–coated paper strips and P-water extraction (Pote et al., 

1999). Horta and Torrent (2007a) evaluated the ability of Olsen P method to predict the P release 

from Portuguese acid soils into waters, achieving an environmental threshold value of 50 mg P kg-

1. Tentatively, an equivalent threshold value for P-ammonium lactate method may be set to 106 mg 

P kg-1 for the same type of soils (Horta et al., 2010). Those values derived from SPT are considered 

as a change point, above which P losses to receiving waters became unacceptably high. 

Nevertheless, these values depend not only on the amount of extractable P, but also on the soil type 

and desorption situation (Maguire et al., 2005), which may be overcame by the use of DPS index. 

Torrent and Delgado (2001) considered that DPS and STP should not be applicable to 

predict P loss from all soils. These authors indicate, as an alternative, the use of desorption 

procedures in 0.01 M CaCl2 dilute solutions, with ratios mimicking different environmental 

situations: a ratio of 1: 100 for P internal drainage, 1: 1000 for P runoff and 1: 10000 for the P from 



Chapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures 

31 

 

the sediments at the bottom of static waterbodies. As the critical values for P content in the 

equilibrium solutions are: (i) 0.1 mg P L-1 for drainage water (EU-WFD, 2000); (ii) 0.05 mg P L-1 

for water runoff (Golterman and Oude, 1991); and 0.02-0.03 mg P L-1 for static waterbodies 

(Correll, 1999). Above the referred values, a declining of water quality and risk of eutrophication 

may occur. 

The majority of the soils in the Azores archipelago have been classified, according to WRB 

(2006), as Andosols, showing unique properties as defined by their main physical, chemical and 

mineralogical characteristics (Pinheiro et al., 2001). These soils originated from volcanic glass 

materials such as ashes, cinders and pumice and evolving under specific environmental conditions, 

are dominated by imogolite, ferrihydrite, allophanes and Al/Fe-humus components (García-Rodeja 

et al., 2007).  

Eutrophication has been reported in several lakes of the Azores  and despite the adoption 

of several measures, the European Union Water-Framework Directive failed (Cruz et al., 2015). 

Values higher than the threshold indices (DPS and Pi-Olsen) for the Sete-Cidades watershed in S. 

Miguel island were reported by Simões (2001). Results showed that Pi-Olsen and the DPS were 

highly related (r &gt; 0.92***) and the author indicates a threshold value for Pi-Olsen of 58 mg P kg
-

1 for a 25 % DPS, well above the agronomical Pi-Olsen critical value of 25 mg P kg
-1.  

Considering that low soil nutrient availability limits net primary production (Campo and 

Vazquez-Yanes, 2004) in Andosols, mineral fertilizers have widely been used to enhance soil 

fertility and improve production yields. However, a large proportion of added P is adsorbed onto 

the surfaces of Al and Fe oxides becoming less available for plant uptake (Takeda et al., 2009), 

which often leads to situations of P over-fertilization. Simultaneously, in Pico island, where 40 % 

of the territory is dedicated to dairy livestock, several watersheds have been identified as under 

high environmental risk and fertilization practices in grazed pastures are associated to those risks 

(SRAM, 2011). 

Assuming that agriculture is a non-point water polluter, it was hypothesized that high 

contents of the different soil inorganic P pools should be the main source of loaded P into 

freshwaters. Therefore, the specific aims of the present work were to study (i) the vertical P

32 

 

distribution in six soils dedicated to grazed pasture and regularly fertilized at the surface, (ii) to 

assess the risks of P losses from these soils by desorption methodologies and DPS values, and (iii) 

to identify possible practices which may decrease the potential environmental impacts of livestock 

production on the freshwater quality.

Six soils from the Pico island, Azores archipelago, were selected. Their classification 

according to WRB (2006), management practices and weighed means of some chemical parameters 

are presented in Table 2.1.

The soils are located between 200 and 700 m of altitude and none of them have been tilled for 

the last 20 years. Except for soil VI, the grazed pastures have been fertilized every year, according 

to the amounts referred in Table 2.1. 

2.3.2 - Soil Sampling 

 The superficial layer of 15 cm was selected in each location and then subdivided in 5 sub-

in duplicate.  

2.3.3 - Soil Analysis 

 The methods used for P determinations are briefly presented in Table 2.2.

Phosphorus retention index (PR, %) was assessed according to Blackmore et al. (1987) and pH 

in suspension of 1:2.5, soil:water (Table 2.1). To obtain DPS values, Pox, Feox and Alox were 

extracted with ammonium-oxalate-oxalic acid (Schwertmann, 1964). Feox and Alox determinations 

in the extracts were performed by atomic absorption spectrometry (Thermo Scientific ICE 3000 

Series AA Spectrometer). Quantification of Pox was performed after the digestion of the extract 

with sulfuric acid/H2O2 (Novozamsky et al., 1986). 

The DPS values were calculated according to Van der Zee et al. (1988, 1990) as indicated

2.3.4 - P desorption 

A 30 days’ experiment was carried out in order to mimic scenarios of soil P desorption. Before the 

experiment, the soil was finely ground (&amp;lt;1 mm) and thoroughly homogenized. Mimicking 

conditions of drainage, runoff and large waterbodies standing over soil sediment (e.g. lakes and 

reservoirs), 1: 100, 1: 1000 and 1: 10000 soil: solution ratios were used (Torrent and Delgado, 

2001) with 0.01M CaCl2 as the supporting electrolyte solution. Considering that the very superficial 

soil layers are the main source for soil erosion and P-runoff, the 1: 10000 suspension methodology 

was only conducted for the top samples (0-1 cm) and 1: 1000 suspensions were conducted for the 

two more superficial samples (0-1 and 1-2 cm). The soil suspensions were placed in polyethylene 

bottles, at 25°C, and shaken for 30 min each on the two first days, and then once a week. After the 

30-d period, portions of each suspension were filtrated (0.2 µm) and P contents in the solution was 

determined. P content on the extracts or digestates were determined by the molybdate-ascorbic acid 

blue method (Coutinho, 1996) in a segmented flow analyser (SanPlus, Skalar, Breda, NL) after a 

dialysis step to prevent interference from color and solids in suspension. 

2.3.5 - Statistical analysis 

Weighted means in each profile were calculated taking into consideration the different 

thickness of each layer. Statistical analyses (linear and logarithmic regressions, arithmetic and 

weighed averages, ranges and Pearson correlation coefficients (r)) were carried out using Analysis 

ToolPak and Solver supplement of Microsoft Excel®. The symbols *, ** and *** indicate 

significance at &amp;lt;0.05, &amp;lt;0.01 and &amp;lt;0.001 probability (p) levels, respectively.

2.4 Results and Discussion 

2.4.1 - Soil P status 

The overall mean values for Pi contents of the studied soils is 1.2 g P kg
-1, which represents 

about 46 % of the total soil P content, in accordance with the range of 30 to 70 % for Pi pool on Pt 

referred by Amano (1981) for Andosols. With the exception of soils IV and V, the contents decrease 

along the soil profiles, (Table 2.3). This P stratification may be explained by several causes, 

namely: P inorganic fertilization, and strong P interactions with the soil matrix in the superficial 

layers (Tiecher et al., 2012). 

The six soils under study present also a strong Pi-Olsen decreasing stratification (Figure 

2.1), along the profile, with the exception of Soil VI, which was never tilled. The Pi-Olsen values 

ranged between 112 and 2 mg P kg-1, being the overall average of the top 15 cm of about 39 mg P 

kg-1. Soils III and V presented, respectively, the lowest (9 mg P kg-1) and the highest (77 mg P kg-

1) Pi-Olsen weighed average contents. Using 51 soils from Azores, Ferreira el al. (2012) assessed 

an agronomic critical value of 20 mg Pi-Olsen kg
-1 for grazing grass species. As it can be seen in 

Figure 2.1, the weighted average of Pi-Olsen in the studied soils equals or surpassed that value, 

except for Soil III, indicating that most of the pasture soils may be over-fertilized, with both 

economic and environmental negative consequences. Similar observations were reported by 

Simões (2001) for fertilized pasture soils of the Sete Cidades watershed (S. Miguel island – 

Azores), where an abrupt decrease of Pi-Olsen in the deepest layer (10-25 cm) was observed. Just 

as for Pi, Rodrigues et al. (2016) also reported an enrichment of labile Pi in the 0-5 cm layer in a 

no-till system, as result of the accumulation of P fertilizer and crop residues.

Figure 2.2 - Profile stratification of P-AL (mg P kg-1) in the top 15 cm layer of the six soils studied; weighted average 

in solid line and agronomical threshold level in dashed line. 

Similarly, to Olsen extraction, soils III and V presented, respectively, the lowest (7.7 mg P 

kg-1) and the highest (73.7 mg P kg-1) P-AL contents on the weighted average of the top 15 cm. 

Although less adapted to this conditions as a STP (Ferreira el al., 2012), P-AL values also 

demonstrate that some soils may be over-fertilized, taking into consideration the agronomical 

critical value of 18 mg P kg-1 indicated by the same authors. 

The extraction of soluble P-CaCl2 in a 1: 10 soil: solution ratio (Table 2.3), also used as soil 

fertility diagnostic tool (Houba et al., 1990), showed that only the top layer (0-1 cm) presents 



Chapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures 

40 

 

detectable P content in all soils, ranging from &amp;lt;0.01 to 6.29 mg P kg-1. Only soils IV and VI had 

detectable P-CaCl2 in all the layers. Sánchez-Alcalá et al. (2014) observed that soil suspensions in 

0.01M CaCl2 may underestimate the P contents in soil solution due to the ionic strength and 

presence of Ca ion on P adsorption, being this effect more pronounced in calcareous soils. The 

same authors also observed that the P-CaCl2 values tend to decrease with the increase of soil buffer 

capacity, as the case of the soils derived from volcanic ashes. Therefore, this underestimation needs 

to be under consideration when soil P status is assessed with 0.01M CaCl2. 

All the extraction methods used for assessing labile Pi are related and were compared among 

each other (Figure 2.3) and some considerations may be pointed out based on the results. As 

observed by the data presented by Horta et al. (2010) for acidic non-volcanic soils, the relationship 

between Pi-Olsen and P-AL is in fact curvilinear, revealing a possible underestimation of labile Pi 

by Olsen method for soils with high contents of extractable P (&gt; 100 mg Pi-Olsen kg
-1). This effect 

may be due to soil: solution ratio that leads to the supersaturation of the extraction medium, 

allowing an incomplete dissolution and/or P re-adsorption to the solid phases (Horta and Torrent, 

2007b). Even with a similar 1: 20 ratio, AL method may overcome this drawback, since lactate 

anion can replace the displaced P on the solid phases, reducing the re-adsorption phenomenon 

(Thomas and Peaslee, 1973). Studying soils with andic properties from Azores archipelago, 

Auxtero and Madeira (2008) found an highly significant correlation (r = 0.77***) between both 

methods, but all the samples presented values ? 100 mg P kg-1. On the other hand, both Olsen and 

AL extraction results in the studied soils showed similar or even higher correlations with the Pi 

contents (r = 0.96*** and 0.85***, respectively) than between them (r = 0.84***).

This observation may reflect the different pools of Pi extracted by both methods (Thomas and 

Peaslee, 1973). Therefore, it is expectable a high level of correlation between Pi-Olsen and P-AL 

for homogeneous groups of soils, just as in the present work and the cited studies. However, for 

sets of soils with a high range of pH, parent material, OC, clay, and calcium carbonate, the 

correlation seems to be nonexistent (r = 0.38ns), as observed by Fernandes et al. (1999). 

Although linear relationships between soluble P-CaCl2 and extractable Pi-Olsen or P-AL 

are significant, data fits better to a logarithmical model as shown in Figure 4b and 4c, with Pearson 

coefficient of  0.79*** for Pi-Olsen and r = 0.86*** for P-AL. Hue and Fox (2010), also for 

volcanic soils but with a much larger range of values, found a higher correlation between log P-

CaCl2 and Pi-Olsen (r = 0.95***).  

2.4.2 - Extractable Alox and Feox 

Regarding the Alox and Feox contents, defined as an andic property for Andosols, their values 

are higher in the group of the Haplic and Placic Andosols (Soils I, II and III) than in the group of 

Vitric Andosols (Soils IV, V and VI), in accordance with their relative degree of pedogenetic 

development. In terms of weighed averages, Soil III presents the highest Alox content and soil IV 

the smallest content, with values of 1903 and 809 mmol Alox kg
-1 respectively. Regarding Feox, 

Soil I presents the highest content and soil V the smallest content, with values of 196 and 74 mmol 

Feox kg
-1, respectively (Table 2.3). Both values increase with depth, in accordance with the 

observations of Pinheiro et al. (2001) along the complete profile of Andosols from Azores. Contents 

of Alox and Feox have negative correlations with Pi (r = -0.80*** and -0.83***, respectively). 

Contents of Pox decrease with soil depth (Table 2.3), just as with all the other forms of 

mineral P. Nevertheless, Pox has no significant correlation with P-AL, and is poorly correlated 

either with Pi and Pi-Olsen (r = 0.48* and 0.52*, respectively). The highest correlation is observed 

with Pt (r = 0.87***), since Pox includes mineral and organic forms of P due to the previous acid 

digestion conducted before P determination.

2.4.3 - Risk assessment indices 

Concerning the indices of risk assessment for P losses, the highest and the lowest weighed 

means for DPS index were observed in Soils V and III, with values of 15.2 % and 5.1 %, 

respectively, although these values do not reflect the situation of the most superficial layers. The 

DPS values showed an accentuated decrease trend along the profile of the studied soils, with the 

exception for soil VI (Figure 2.4). For instance, the layer 1-5 cm of Soil V presents a value of 21 

% and layers 0-2 cm of Soil III present a value of 9 % for DPS. Nevertheless, and as it can be 

confirmed in Figure 5, none of the studied soils reach the critical values of 25 % or 35 % pointed 

out by van der Zee et al. (1988) and De Bolle et al. (2013) for risks of P losses into the environment. 

Generally, the group of Haplic and Placic Andosols presents much lower values of DPS, 

with an overall mean of 6.6 %, as a result of their higher content of Alox and Feox, with the highest 

values being observed at the most superficial layer (0-1 cm). On the opposite, the group of Vitric 

Andosols presents a much higher value of DPS (14 % for the overall mean), and the highest values 

are observed in the layers between 1 and 5 cm. 

Considering the formula of DPS and that PR is a result of Al and Fe soil components of 

these soils, it is observed a negative relationship between DPS and PR (r = -0.77***, n = 30). 

Nevertheless, and as shown in Figure 2.4, this general correlation is not effective to predict DPS 

from PR values, since Haplic and Placic Andosols and Vitric Andosols show a different behavior. 

Haplic and Placic Andosols present values of PR near 100 %, with a small range of variation, 

although with a clear relationship with the low values of DPS (r = -0.84***, n = 15). Meanwhile, 

the relationship for the Vitric Andosols is less meaningful (r = -0.46, n = 15), in spite of the larger 

variation in PR values. 

Although Pox and Pi are poorly correlated, as previously refereed, a very close relationship 

is observed between Pi and DPS (r = 0.90***), with no segregation among the samples from Haplic 

and Placic Andosols or Vitric Andosols. From our results, a general threshold value of 3.0 g Pi kg
-

1 can be set for soils with identical characteristics, in order to maintain their DPS value below 25 

%, the more conservative critical value referred in the literature. Significant correlations can be 

also observed between DPS and Pi-Olsen (r = 0.90***) or P-AL results (r = 0.79***). Particularly 

for Pi-Olsen, the relationship is presented in Figure 2.5, where it can be observed again that no 



Chapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures 

44 

 

segregation occurs among the studied Haplic and Placic Andosols and the Vitric Andosols. Based 

on the available data and on a critical value for DPS of 25 %, a threshold value of 135 mg P kg-1 

for extractable Pi-Olsen can be estimated for these soils. This value is well above the threshold 

value of 50 mg P kg-1 proposed by Horta and Torrent (2007a) for a batch of soils with different 

characteristics, namely with much lower P retention capacity. 

 
Figure 2.4 - Degree of phosphorus saturation (DPS) profile stratification of the top 15 cm layer of the six soils studied; 

solid line 25 % conservative critical value (van der Zee et al., 1988) and in dashed line the 35 % critical value for acid 

soils used by De Bolle et al. (2013). 

Therefore, it should be accepted that specific threshold value need to be set for different 

soil units. Furthermore, this environmental threshold value of 135 mg P kg-1 for extractable Pi-



Chapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures 

45 

 

Olsen is also well above the agronomical critical value of 20 mg P kg-1 for extractable Pi-Olsen 

(Ferreira et al., 2012), which means that environmental protection for P does not necessary means 

limitations on plant nutrition and production.

25 % (van der Zee et al., 1988) and in dashed line 35 % used by De Bolle et al. (2013). 

A significant correlation between DPS and P-CaCl2 was also observed (r = 0.56**, n = 20). 

For a conservative DPS value of 25 %, above which there are concerns for P losses, a threshold P-

CaCl2 value of 8.8 mg P kg
-1 (equivalent to 0.88 mg P L-1) was assessed. Once more, this value is 

above the agronomic threshold value of 0.2 mg P L-1, proposed by Fox and Kamprath (1970) for 

maximum yield. Although in same layers of the Vitric Andosols P-CaCl2 values were above the 

referred agronomic threshold, the individual weighted average of the 15 cm soil depth in all the six 

soils were below 0.1 mg P L-1 (Table 2.3). Hue and Fox (2010), in Hawaiian volcanic ash derived 

soils, also reported a maximum 95 % yield, achieved when the soil P solution was above 0.2 mg P 

L-1. When compiling information about different crops, the same authors reported agronomic 

critical values of 0.1 and 0.3 mg P L-1 for some pasture species (ryegrass and white clover, 

respectively). Nevertheless, it must be re-stated that P-CaCl2 values may be underestimated in soils 

with high buffer capacity (Sánchez-Alcalá et al., 2014), just as the soils under study.

2.4.4 - Desorption risk assessment 

The P desorption in 0.01M CaCl2 with a soil: solution ratio 1: 100 is intended to assess the 

P internal drainage, and consequently (i) the risk of ground waters contamination, but also (ii) the 

readiness of leaching of superficial applied P along the soils profile. Considering the critical P 

value for drainage waters as 0.1 mg P L-1 (EU-WFD, 2000), none of the soils seem to be of concern 

to groundwater contamination. Once more, soil V presented the highest detectable value, 0.08 mg 

P L-1 in the most superficial layer (Table 2.4). The available results also show the marked 

immobility of P, justifying its accumulation in the superficial layers and not leading to its 

redistribution along the soil profiles when P is applied with no incorporation. 

Assessing the risk of superficial P runoff from soils, only 0-1 and 1-2 cm layers were 

considered for the essay at the ratio 1:1000. Soils II and III had undetectable desorbed P (&amp;lt;0.01 

mg P L-1) and soil V presented, again, the higher desorbed P content, 0.04 and 0.02 mg P L-1. 

Therefore, the same observation can be made as for the leaching risk assessment. None of the soils 

seems to be of concern for P desorption for the water flowing through the superficial layers, since 

the critical limit for P runoff is established for 0.05 mg P L-1 (Golterman and Oude, 1991).  

Assuming that the soil particles are more easily eroded from the very surficial layers, 

generating sediment accumulation in the interior waterbodies, the essay with the 1:10000 ratios 

was only conducted for the 0-1 cm depth. Considering the critical limit of 0.025 - 0.03 mg P L-1 

(Correll, 1999), above which water eutrophication can be promoted, the risk of the P desorption 

from sediments at the bottom of waterbodies was not detected for the particles from the soils under 

study. According to the obtained results, only soil V presents a P content above the detection limit 

(0.01 mg P L-1), as it can be observed in Table 2.4. 

According to Yli-Halla et al. (2002), the loading P potential from soil is easily 

underestimated if an insufficiently strong sink is used. In general, the amount of desorbed P 

increase with the decrease of the soil: solution ratio. As it can be observed in Table 2.4, when the 

sink is enlarged, by increasing the volume of electrolyte solution, and the size of soil sample 

remains constant, the amount of desorbed P increases, despite the decrease of its concentration in 

the equilibrium solution.

Table 2.4 - Desorption experiment P values in 0.01M CaCl2 (soil: solution ratio 1: 100, 1: 1000 and 1: 10000 represent 

the risk of P losses through water drainage, runoff and waterbodies, respectively). 

Considering both groups of the soils under study, the observed results for the risk 

assessment are once more in concordance with their characteristics. Vitric Andosols are lower in 

soil layer limits P-CaCl2 - electrolyte solution

Alox and Feox, which enhances their ability to desorb P more easily, presenting thus higher desorbed 

P values for all the essays, compared with the group of Haplic and Placic Andosols.  

Horta and Torrent (2007b), assessing the risk of P desorption in different Mediterranean 

soils, found higher desorbed P values. In soils subjected to high fertilization rates, Horta et al. 

(2013) also found higher desorbed P in the superficial horizon. In both cases, some of the values 

observed surpass the environmental critical limits. Nevertheless, these results may be due to the 

weak ability of those soils to sorb P, due to the low contents in Fe and Al compounds. 

Although the obtained values suggest that P associated with the soil components is not an 

evident risk for environment, fresh-water eutrophication phenomenon is a reality in the Azores 

islands. In studies being conducted presently, in the Furnas watershed, S. Miguel island, Fontes 

and Pinheiro (2016), observed up to 0.19 mg P L-1 in runoff waters, being the higher values well 

above the environmental threshold value of 0.05 mg P L-1. Therefore, another mechanism for P 

runoff may be considered, since fertilizers are superficially placed without incorporation. As 

rainfall events are common in the region, it must be considered the hypothesis of a direct loading 

of the mineral P into the watersheds, risk which is aggravated by the steep slope of many of the 

highland pastures. So, the direct runoff of fertilizers may occur, even before P compounds being 

completely dissolved and has reacted with the soil matrix. If true, inorganic P fertilization may 

have to be placed through deep-banding systems in longer periods of time, since soil mobilization 

is out of question. Simultaneously, this alternative will allow the maintenance of the P inorganic 

fertilization and its effective efficiency, since some pasture yields may be limited by shortage of P 

on sub-superficial layers due to the high retention capacity of the soils. In the case of the Haplic 

and Placic Andosols (Figure 2.1 and 2.2), in spite of the high contents of Pi-Olsen on the superficial 

layers, as a result of the fertilization, or even over fertilization, the values presented between 5-15 

cm are below the previously referred agronomical critical value of 20 mg P kg-1 (Ferreira et al., 

2012), depth where roots may absorb the majority of the P that pastures species need. Nevertheless, 

this solution will not be effective for the potential risk derived from the faeces superficial 

deposition of the grazing animals, which represents also a high risk for water contamination 

through direct runoff of particulate organic P during rainfall events.

2.5 - Conclusions   

The six studied soils presented a stratified gradient along the profile evaluated for the 

different P pools assessed. This stratification seems to be consequence both of the superficial 

application of fertilizers without incorporation and the high adsorption capacity of the soils 

inducing the P fixation at the surface layers. 

The total Pi decreased along the profile of the studied soils, although the Haplic and Placic 

Andosols have a lower contribution of Pi to Pt, in opposition to the Vitric Andosols. The extracted 

Alox and Feox showed an inverse distribution to the P pools, increasing with the soil profile depth. 

Among soils, Haplic and Placic Andosols have higher Alox and Feox contents than the Vitric 

Andosols. 

Although the obtained values for P by extracted by the Olsen, ammonium lactate and CaCl2 

methods are above the agronomical threshold limits, they are still below the environmental 

threshold values estimated either by the desorbed P in 0.01M CaCl2 suspensions or the DSP. The 

latter presents values ranging from 5.1 % to 15.2 %, safely below the more conservative limit of 

25 %. Compared with Haplic and Placic Andosols, Vitric Andosols present higher values, closer to 

the environmental limits, due to their lower contents of Alox and Feox extracted by ammonium 

oxalate as responsible for P adsorption. 

The obtained results point out that P desorption from soil solid phases in these soils is very 

limited and thus may not represent a significant cause of P losses and risk of eutrophication to the 

watersheds of this region. Therefore, the hypothesis of P transport by direct runoff of the 

superficially applied fertilizers before dissolution and reaction with soil constituents should be 

considered, especially in the steepest slope pastures.

3.1 - Abstract 

Nutrient cycling is an essential microbial function in soils, which can be affected by fertilization 

practices and soils characteristics. This work aimed to study the effect of the management of soils derived 

from volcanic materials on the amounts and vertical distribution of organic carbon, organic phosphorus (P) 

and acid phosphatase (AP) and ?-glucosidase (?G) activities, in the 15 cm top layers of six pasture soils.  

It was observed a superficial accumulation of organic carbon (OC) and organic P pools, correlated 

with ammonium oxalate extractable Aluminum (Alox) and Iron (Feox) contents, particularly with Feox. The 

accumulated OC and Po were both correlated with the stratified gradients of the enzymes activities. AP was 

not subjected to inhibition promoted by inorganic P fertilization. On the contrary, and considering all the 30 

soil samples, AP activity showed a positive linear relationship (r = 0.57**) with Pi. 

The stoichiometric relationship between both enzymes presented high values for the AP: ?G activity 

ratio. These results suggest a high energy allocation effort of microbial communities to ensure P acquisition 

for homeostasis maintenance. The AP: ?G ratios were higher in soils with high Alox and Feox contents, 

namely Haplic and Placic Andosols (between 10.7 and 14.7). The potential C:P acquisition values were 

below the 0.95 global average in both group of soils (between 0.74 and 0.91), presenting a high inverse 

correlation with Alox+Feox content (r = -0.90***, n = 30). These results suggest that the effort for P 

acquisition (AP: ?G) and the potential of C:P acquisition (ln(?G):ln(AP)) are both affected by the size of 

the Pi pools and by Al and Fe contents. If available Pi exists at levels able to supply growth requirements 

and ensure homeostasis condition, the energy allocation to produce AP enzymes decreases. Although, as Pi 

retention increases due to high Al and Fe minerals contents, energy allocation shifts to the production of AP 

enzymes to mineralize soil Po. Moreover, the average C:P molar ratio of the six soils was below (115) the 

value proposed for pasture soils (166), above which soils may present low P availability. 

Nevertheless, the present work do not allow a clear justification for the OC accumulation in the 

studied soils, since Al and Fe compounds are simultaneously related with different soil parameters. 

Therefore, several hypotheses may be considered: (i) the ability of Al and Fe compounds to bound and 

protect organic molecules from mineralization; (ii) the low ?G activity, which seems to be depressed by Al 

and Fe compounds affecting the rate of the OC mineralization; (iii) the high demand of energy for P 

acquisition due to the intense Pi retention on the Al and Fe compounds, which shifts the allocation of cell 

resources in detriment of microbe growth, limiting the size of the soil microbial biomass compartment.

3.2 - Introduction 

The recovering process of key nutrients from residue inputs and accumulated soil organic 

matter (SOM) is an essential microbial function in soils. Generally, these fluxes require the activity 

of extracellular enzymes to process the complex compounds of organic matter into assimilable 

subunits (Caldwell, 2005). Since enzyme activities can be reliably determined in laboratory, have 

microbial ecological significance, are sensitive to environmental stress and respond rapidly to 

changes in land management, the use of soil extracellular enzymes as biological indicators is of 

great interest (Dick, 1997). Nevertheless, these essays measure the potential activity of the enzymes 

(Vmax) and not their actual activities, since the conditions in the laboratory (pH, temperature, 

substrate concentration, and diffusion coefficients) are different from those occurring in situ 

(Nannipieri et al., 2002). 

Andosols are known to display unique morphological, physical and chemical properties 

attributed to the components of their amorphous fraction, like allophane, imogolite, ferrihydrite 

and Al/Fe–humus complexes (Shoji et al., 1993), accompanied by a high capacity to adsorb P, 

which may affect its agronomic use. Volcanic ash soils usually also contain high amounts of 

organic matter (OM) (Batjes, 1996). Although comprising only 0.84 % of the global land area, 

these soils store approximately 5,0 % of the global soil C (Eswaran et al., 1993; Dahlgren et al., 

2004). The hypotheses that can explain SOM accumulations in Andosols are: (i) P is a rate-limiting 

factor for OM mineralization (Buurman et al., 2007) attributed to the large P-fixing capacity of 

these soils; (ii) biodegradation of SOM is limited by its complexation with Fe, Al and allophanic 

constituents  (Matus et al., 2014); (iii) enzymes and microbial by-products may be deactivated by 

adsorption on short-range order mineral surfaces of andic soils (Saggar et al., 1994); (iv) the 

microbial decomposition of OM may be limited by low pH values and Al toxicity (Tate and Theng, 

1980) especially in non-allophanic Andosols. In Andosols, the formation of metal–humus 

complexes with SOM leaves little or no Al available to be limiting for microbes and plants (Shoji 

and Masui, 1972). 

SOM fuels the metabolic activity beneath soil surface (Bauer and Black, 1994) and is an 

important indicator of soil quality and productivity (Reeves, 1997). The potential activities of 

extracellular enzymes are important indicators nutrient availabilities in soils. Since the synthesis 



Chapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  

distribution profile and P acquisition effort 

57 

 

of extracellular ?-glucosidase and phosphatases represents a large metabolic investment, their 

production is induced when labile C and/or inorganic phosphorus (P), respectively, are in short 

supply (Zheng et al., 2015). Consequently, enzyme production and release from cells can be 

depressed or induced by genetic expression according to environmental signals (Sinsabaugh and 

Shah, 2012). Soil P concentrations regulate the phosphatase activity through Pi signal transduction 

pathway (PHO), a mechanism linked to cellular P homeostasis (Dick et al., 2011). Phosphatase 

synthesis is regulated throughout the growth phase of microbial cells and is influenced by 

exogenous and endogenous P pools (Persson et al., 2003). Phosphatase activity is repressed in non-

limiting P medium, but once exogenous P content is limiting, phosphatase mRNA and 

phosphatases synthesis are induced (Dick et al., 2011).  

The exoenzyme ?-glucosidase  (?G) plays a major role in degradation of carbohydrates in 

soils and its synthesis is induced by the products of cellulose breakdown, including cellobiose, 

glucose and their metabolites (Stewart and Leatherwood, 1976). Research has shown that ?G is the 

most abundant and easily detectable of the three enzymes (endo-1,4-glucanase, exo-1,4-glucanase 

and ?-D-glucosidase) involved in cellulose degradation in soil, and is rarely substrate limited, thus 

making it ideal to examine the importance of physico-chemical controls on the turnover of SOM 

(Turner et al., 2002). Therefore, ?G activity has been used to closely monitor rapid changes in soil 

organic C associated with soil management effects (Bandick and Dick, 1999). On the other hand, 

?G contributes to provide energy for soil microorganisms and is directly related to soil organic C 

content (Eivazi and Tabatabai, 1988; Bandick and Dick, 1999). This enzyme catalyzes the cleavage 

of one mole of cellobiose in two moles of glucose, regulating the supply of energy for 

microorganisms, which are unable to take up cellobiose directly. Alef and Nannipieri (1995) 

referred that ?G activity may be the rate-limiting step in cellulose degradation. 

Regarding phosphatases, the name includes a broad group of enzymes that catalyze the 

hydrolysis of both esters and anhydrides of phosphoric acid (Schmidt and Laskowski, 1961). Acid 

phosphatases (AP) and alkaline phosphatases are phosphoric monoester hydrolases with optimal 

activities in acid and alkaline environments, whereas phosphodiesterase is a phosphoric diester 

hydrolase. All these three enzymes act on ester bonds (Deng and Tabatabai, 1997). Phosphatases 

play a key role in soil P cycling by catalyzing mineralization of organic P and contributing to the 



Chapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  

distribution profile and P acquisition effort 

58 

 

increasing of soil P bioavailability. Like any exoenzyme molecule, phosphomonoesterases diffuse 

poorly into the soil matrix (Lefebvre et al., 1990) and their activities are dependent of different 

parameters such as soil characteristics, microorganism, plant cover, inputs and the presence of 

inhibitors or activators (Speir and Ross, 1978). Generally, it is assumed that phosphomonoesterases 

activity is dependent on the enzymes associated with viable or lysed microbial cells, root-released 

enzymes into the rhizosphere and detritosphere soil (Nannipieri, 1994), although root-released 

enzymes probably mineralize organic P from sloughed off or damaged cells rather than from native 

soil organic P (Lefebvre et al. 1990). Nevertheless, the major contribution to its activity in soil is 

due to the extracellular enzymes stabilized by colloids (Nannipieri, 2011). In volcanic soils, 

minerals such as allophane and ferrihydrite showed evidences of soil enzymes protection, namely 

AP and ?G, and other enzymes appear to be sorbed in the soil minerals without discrimination of 

the enzyme type (Allison, 2006). 

Fertilization affects soil biochemical and biological properties (Liang et al., 2014), and the 

influence of external nutrient inputs on soil microbial ecology has been frequently emphasized (Ai 

et al., 2012). As an example, PO4
3- is a competitive inhibitor of both phosphomonoesterases in soils 

(Juma and Tabatabai, 1978), although the absence of response of phosphatase activities to P 

addition has been also reported (Schneider et al., 2001). On the other hand, N fertilization generally 

increases the activity of phosphatases in soils (Marklein and Houlton, 2012). 

Regarding the equilibrium between C and P availability, Sinsabaugh et al. (2010) found an 

average value of 1.6 for the ratio of acid phosphatase to ?-glucosidase activities in 40 different 

soils with no andic characteristics. Nevertheless, in a long-term field experiment on an Andosol, 

Moro et al. (2015) observed an increase from 3.9 to 9.5 of the same ratio when no P was added or 

when P was limiting plant growth. Accordingly, the value of this ratio seems to reflect, even for 

crops, the variable readiness for acquiring phosphorus in soils with different P retention capacity 

or with different mineral P (or N) fertilizations. 

Mineral fertilizers are widely used in the Azores region to enhance soil fertility and improve 

pasture production, particularly P fertilization due to the high contents of active fractions of Al and 

Fe and consequent high P retention capacity of the soils. Consequently, it was hypothesized that 

the abundant presence of Al and Fe active minerals may present a specific role on the relationships 



Chapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  

distribution profile and P acquisition effort 

59 

 

among soil OC, P enrichment and their effects over the activity of free AP and BG enzymes in 

these particular soils. Therefore, the specific aims of this work were: (i) to evaluate the stratification 

?G and AP activities in the 15 cm superficial layer of six Andosols collected in Azores (Pico Island) 

under cattle grazed pasture and fertilization over the past 20 years, and; (ii) to study the 

relationships among both enzymes, SOM accumulation and inorganic P fertilization; and (iii) 

assess the effect of Al and Fe active minerals in ?G and AP activities and P acquisition effort.

3.3 - Materials and methods 

3.3.1 - Soil classification and land management 

Six soils, from commercial farms, in Pico island of the Azores archipelago, located between 

200 and 700m of altitude, were selected. Soil I is a Haplic Andosol, II and III are Placic Andosol 

and IV, V and VI are Leptic Vitric Andosol, according to WRB (2006) classification. Soils I and 

VI were never tilled and the remaining ones have not been tilled for more than 20 years. All soils 

are under pastures use, being fertilized annually. 

3.3.2 - Soil Sampling 

A superficial layer of 15 cm was selected in each location and then subdivided in 5 sub-

layers (0-1, 1-2, 2-5, 5-10 and 10-15 cm) making a total of 30 soil samples, for the six sites. Samples 

were air-dried, sieved through a 2-mm screen, and stored for the analysis, which were conducted 

in duplicate.  

3.3.3 - Soil Analysis 

Phosphate retention (PR, %) was assessed according to Blackmore et al. (1987), organic 

carbon (OC) through NIRD in elemental analyzer (Primac SC, Skalar; Breda, NL), and pH in a 

1:2.5, soil-water suspension. Actives Fe and Al were extracted according to the ammonium-

oxalate-oxalic acid method (Schwertmann et al., 1964) and quantifications in the extracts were 

performed by atomic absorption spectrometry (Thermo Scientific ICE 3000 Series AA 

Spectrometer), their individual values are presented in chapter 2.  

3.3.4 - P characterization 

Total P (Pt) was determined after ignition (550°C/2h), by extracting 2g of air dried soil 

(1:25 soil-solution/16h) with 0.5M H2SO4. Inorganic P (Pi) was determined after extracting 2g of 

air dried soil (1:25 soil-solution/16h) with 0.5M H2SO4. Organic P (Po) was obtained by the 

difference between Pt and Pi, according to Saunders and Williams (1955) modified by Walker and 

Adams (1958). Extractable inorganic P (Pi-Olsen) was determined by the Olsen method (Olsen et 

al., 1954). Total P Olsen (Pt-Olsen) was assessed by digesting an aliquot of the previous extract 

with 11M H2SO4 and (NH4)2S2O8 (USEPA, 1982). Organic P Olsen (Po-Olsen) was obtained by 



Chapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  

distribution profile and P acquisition effort 

61 

 

the difference between Pt-Olsen and Pi-Olsen. Soil P intensity (P-CaCl2) was determined according 

to Houba et al. (1990), by shaking air dried soil in 0.01M CaCl2 (1:10 soil-solution/30min). P 

concentration in the soil extracts and digestates were determined by the molybdate-ascorbic acid 

blue method in a segmented flow analyser (SanPlus, Skalar, Breda, NL) after a dialysis step to 

prevent interference from color and solids in suspension (Coutinho, 1996). 

3.3.5 - Enzymatic activity 

The potential enzymatic activities of ?-glucosidase and acid phosphatases were quantified 

according to Tabatabai (1994). Briefly, P-nitrophenyl-?-D-glucopyranoside was used as substrate 

to determine the ?G activity in a modified universal buffer (pH 6.0) and incubated for 1h at 37ºC. 

AP activity was determined with p-nitrophenyl-phosphate as substrate in a modified universal 

buffer (pH 6.5) and incubated for 1h at 37ºC. In both enzymatic activity determinations, the final 

p-nitrophenol (p-NP) concentration, as the reaction product, was determined by molecular 

absorption spectrophotometry, at 400nm, in a segmented flow analyser (SanPlus, Skalar, Breda, 

NL), and expressed in µg p-NP g-1h-1. 

3.3.6 - Statistical analysis 

Weighted means in each profile were calculated taking into consideration the different 

thickness of each layer. Statistical analyses (linear and logarithmical regressions, arithmetic and 

weighed averages, ranges and Pearson correlation coefficients (r)) were carried out using Analysis 

ToolPak and Solver supplement of Microsoft Excel®. The symbols *, ** and *** indicate 

significance at &amp;lt;0.05, &amp;lt;0.01 and &amp;lt;0.001 probability (p) levels, respectively. Prior to analysis of 

the potentials for nutrient acquisition, exoenzymatic activities were loge transformed to normalize 

variance, according to the conventions of stoichiometric analyses (Sinsabaugh et al., 2012).

3.4 - Results and Discussion 

3.4.1 - Soil properties 

The weighted averages of some chemical parameters of the soils under study are shown in 

Table 3.1, based on the individual values for each layer already presented in Chapter 2. 

Table 3.1 - Chemical properties of the studied soils (weighed means of the five assessed layers). 

Concerning OC, soils I and VI had the highest contents, 156 and 178 g OC kg-1, 

respectively. Nevertheless, and despite having the same classification of soils IV and V (Vitric 

Andosols), soil VI seems to present a better preservation of its OC fraction, which may be attributed 

to the fact that it was never tilled, just as soil I. The no-tillage management of the soils is expected 

to be partially responsible for a general  decrease on the OC mineralization fluxes (Reeves, 1997). 

Nevertheless, and according to Eswaran et al. (1993), soils derived from volcanic materials tend to 

accumulate organic matter, as influenced by their andic properties. Inoue and Higashi (1988) 

observed that the accumulation of OC in the upper 35 cm of andic soils have a strong linear 

relationship with extractable Alox and Feox.

Figure 3.1 - Soil profile distribution of a) organic carbon (OC) and b) organic phosphorus (Po) contents. 

In the present study, a significant trend of OC increase was observed only with ammonium 

oxalate extractable Feox (r = 0.54**, n = 30) but not with Alox. Kunito et al. (2016) on forest 

Andosols, pointed out that reduced availability of SOM, as a result of Al and Fe binding, may 

protect a substantial pool of OC from microbial degradation, leading to suppressed microbial 

mediated nutrient cycling. 

In each of the individual soils, the OC contents decreases along the soil profile (Figure 3.1a) 

and this stratification may be due to the management of the soils, since they have been used as 

permanent grazing grasslands, not being tilled for the past 20 years and thus subjected to topsoil 

accumulation of crop residues and faeces deposition. The average content of the soils was of 120 

g OC kg-1 for the whole profile and of 175 g OC kg-1 in the top 0-1 cm layer.  

The mean value for Pt contents of the studied soils is 2.7 g P kg
-1, where Po represents about 

54.3% of the total, which are in accordance with the range of 30 to 70 % for the Po pool on Pt 

referred by Amano (1981) for Andosols. Nevertheless, the extreme values of 23.0 % and 75.3 %, 

observed in soils IV and I respectively, are outside of the range referred by that author.

Gudmundsson et al (2014) also found higher rates of Po than Pi at superficial bulk layer of 15 and 

20 cm of andic soils from Iceland, after long-term inorganic fertilization of grasslands. Considering 

individual profiles, only soils IV and V presented higher Pi content when compared to Po, the same 

soils where the lowest contents of OC, Alox and Feox were also observed (Table 3.1).  

The overall Po mean of the six soils was 1.5 g P kg
-1 in the top 15 cm, decreasing from 2.0 

to 1.3 g Po kg
-1 in depth. As a component of the SOM, Po is highly correlated with OC (r = 0.91***, 

n = 6 and r = 0.96***, n = 30), and represents about 0.72 % of the SOM fraction. Soils I and IV 

had the highest and the lowest contents, 2.1 and 0.55 g P kg-1, respectively. The lower amounts of 

Po and their percentages on Pt in Soils IV and V may be due to their vitric character. In Andosols 

from Japan, Otani and Ae (1999) found that organic forms of P were tightly bound to Al and Fe 

compounds, thus not easily mineralizable by microorganisms, since active Al and Fe may bind 

labile Po in a similar manner to labile Pi. 

Considering that both soils IV and V have lower contents of Alox and Feox, it is expectable 

that the OC, and subsequently Po, also present lower values, as observed in Table 3.1, probably due 

to a faster mineralization or due to the relative youngness of the Vitric Andosols with lower amounts 

of OC accumulation. 

Nevertheless, and as previously referred, despite being also a Vitric Andosol, soil VI 

presents a better preservation of its OC and Po contents, which may be attributed to the fact that it 

was never tilled, reinforcing the effect of an easier mineralization in soils IV and V. With the 

exception of these same soils (IV and V), Po contents decrease along each soil profile (Figure 3.1b). 

In Andosols, Otani and Ae (1999, 1997) also did not observe an accumulation or stratification of 

Po, even after the addition of organic matter, but they observed a clear stratification for Pi. Cade-

Menun et al. (2010) observed that labile Pi concentration was significantly higher under no-till than 

in tilled soils at 5-10 cm layer after a long-term study comparing conservation tillage and 

conventional tillage, but did not observed significant variation in Pt and Po. Rodrigues et al. (2016), 

studying tropical soils under conservative tillage and mineral fertilization, reported a Po built up at 

the surface layers. No-tillage systems led to an accumulation of Po, despite representing less than 

20 % of soil Pt and an increase of labile and non-labile Pi fractions were also observed, in particular 

in the 0-5 cm soil layers, when compared to conventional tillage.

Finally, Alox + Feox contents presented positive correlations with Po (r = 0.51***, n = 30), 

which may indicate the protective effect of Al and Fe constituents on P mineralization (Otani and 

Ae, 1997). As Alox is less correlated with Po (r = 0.48*) than Feox (r = 0.67***), the results may 

also suggest that P organic forms in these type of soils present a higher affinity for Fe than for Al. 

Regarding the organic fraction of P extracted by the Olsen method, soils I and V presents 

also the highest and the lowest Po-Olsen contents, respectively 46 and 10 mg P kg
-1 (Table 3.1). 

The top 2 cm presented an average content of 49 mg P kg-1, about 2.1 times higher than the sub-

superficial layers (5 – 15 cm), where the rhizosphere is primarily developed and nutrients are 

absorbed. As observed for Po, soils IV and V do not show a clear decreasing stratification also for 

Po-Olsen (data not shown). The overall mean of Po-Olsen represents nearly 1.9 % of the total Po, 

although with variations among the samples. In fact, Po-Olsen is correlated with both Po (r = 0.95**) 

and OC (r = 0.91*) when the weighted means of the six soils are considered, since the accumulation 

of OC in the soil leads to the accumulation of Po and subsequently of potentially labile Po-Olsen. 

But when the relationships are searched among the individual values of the 30 samples, two linear 

regressions can be established between Po-Olsen and Po or OC. An expected positive slope and a 

high level of correlation are observed for soils I, II, III and VI, but a negative slope is observed for 

soils IV and V (Figure 3.2). 

In these relationships, Po presents a better correlation (r = 0.90***, n = 20) than OC (r = 

0.72***, n = 20) in soils I, II, III and IV. On the opposite, soils IV and V show a negative slope 

and weaker correlation for both parameters, significant to OC (r = 0.65*, n = 10) but not significant 

to Po. Generally, these results do not fully agree with the data presented by Turner and Haygarth 

(2005) for temperate pastures in non-volcanic soils, since the authors did not found any correlation 

between Po-Olsen and SOM, although Po-Olsen and Po were correlated (r = 0.54**). Soils with 

different characteristics after disturbance undergo through changes in the native OC (Cannell and 

Hawes, 1994) and the same may happen with native Po, with consequences on the Po: Po-Olsen 

ratio. In the present study, although that ratio does not appear to be dependent on the absolute 

content of SOM (r = 0.35ns, n = 30), a significant relationship is observed with pH values (r = -

0.63***, n = 30), with the ratio of the labile organic fraction on Po increasing with soil acidity. On 

the other hand, whereas Po-Olsen (NaHCO3) is considered as labile form of organic P and available

66 

 

P is closely related to these organic P fractions (Tiessen et al., 1984), its specific quantification and 

further study may contribute to advances in soil test procedures and interpretation. In fact, labile 

organic P is undetectable in the molybdate-reactive P in the Olsen extract, but Po-Olsen values, in 

some of our samples, are higher than Pi-Olsen.

organic phosphorus (Po-Olsen),  b) organic phosphorus (Po) versus extractable organic phosphorus (Po-Olsen). 

3.4.2 - Soil enzyme activities 

In our study the weighted means of ?G activity (Table 3.2) vary from 111 (soil III) to 316 

µg p-NP g-1 h-1 (soil V), being generally wither then the 48 and 169 µg p-NP g-1 h-1 reported by 

Dick et al. (1996) for air-dried soils. The group of the Vitric Andosols have a higher average ?G 

activity, presenting approximately twice the activity (296 µg p-NP g-1 h-1) when compared to 

Haplic and Placic Andosols (143 µg p-NP g-1 h-1). 

Concerning the weighted means of AP activity in each soil, values ranged from 1278 (soil 

IV) to 1719 µg p-NP g-1 h-1 for AP, again in soil V. Between those two groups of soils, the averages

of this enzyme activity are more similar than the averages of ?G activity. On the other hand, the 

observed values tend to be on the upper limit of the range reported for air-dried soils (Dick et al., 

1996) or temperate soils under permanent pasture (Turner and Haygarth, 2005), 1112 and 1694 µg 

p-NP g-1 h-1 respectively. In Japanese Andosols, Kunito et al. (2012) also observed high 

phosphatase activity, referring that microbial communities in these soils produce large amounts of 

phosphatases to ensure an adequate P supply. 

In all the six soils, the 0 – 2 cm layer presented the higher activity rates. The gradient of the 

?G and AP potential activities for each soil are shown in Figures 3.3a and 3.3b. Along the soil 

profiles, their gradients show similar trends to those of OC and Po previously referred. Eivazi and 

Tabatabai (1990), when assessing the factors that affect ?G of the 100 cm superficial layer of 

agriculture soils in Iowa, also found a decrease on the potential activity along the soil depth. For 

Iowa soils, the same observation for AP activity was reported by Juma and Tabatabai (1978). Redel 

et al. (2008) in a forest andic soil observed higher values of AP activity on the 0-2cm layer (9700 

to 25300 µg p-NP g-1 h-1) than in the remaining layers until 20 cm depth (6000 to 18200 µg p-NP 

g-1 h-1). Šnajdr et al. (2008) also reported a gradient in the AP and ?G activities along the depth in 

a forest soil. 

Although ?G and AP are highly correlated (r = 0.87***, n =30) with each other (Figure 

3.4a), there were no correlations with OC or Po when the 30 samples were compared. However, 

when the linear correlations for the 5 layers of each of the individual soils were considered, 

relationships were much closer, with most of their r values presenting a high or very high level of 

significance (Figure 3.4b and 3.4c). Eivazi and Tabatabai (1990) and Juma and Tabatabai (1978) 

also found a close relationship between potential soil enzymatic activity and the respective 

substrate (SOM and Po) in each of the studied soils.

Figure 3.3 - Studied soils (a) ?-glucosidase (?G) and (b) acid phosphatase (AP) activities, in the 15 cm stratified 

assessed profile 

Concerning the contents of Alox and Feox extracted (Figure 3.5a and 3.5b) inverse 

correlations of ?G or AP activities were observed, suggesting a repressing effect promoted by these 

soil minerals, as reported by Allison (2006) on Hawaiian Andosols. Moreover, it seems that these 

soils characteristics affect more ?G activity than AP (Figure 3.5a and 3.5b). In fact, both the 

relationship of potential enzymatic activities versus the Alox and Feox content were inverse, but the 

?G versus Alox + Feox was better correlated (r = 0.71***, n = 30) than the AP versus Alox + Feox (r 

= 0.46*, n = 30). Yan et al. (2010) in silty clay Stagnic Anthrosol, reported that the immobilization 

of ?G on inorganic soil colloids may have depressed its free activity untill about 73 %, suggesting 

that the active sites of the enzyme were hindered by the soil colloidal surfaces, resulting in its 

inaccessibility for the substrate or in modifications of the active sites. Therefore, the high contents 

of organic matter usually reported for Andosols (WRB, 2006) may be also related with the reduced 

?G activity due to the high contents of Al and Fe of these soils. In fact, the higher slopes presented 

by both soils IV and V (Vitric Andosols) for the relationship between ?G and OC, about 6 times 

higher than for other soils (Figure 3.4b), suggest a higher substrate availability in the former soils,

which also present lower OC contents as a possible consequence of their lower richness in 

extractable Alox and Feox (Table 3.1)

Moreover, both enzymes seem to be more affected by Al than by Fe. ?G activity presented 

a r = -0.65*** for Alox and r = -0.59** (n = 30) for Feox, while AP activity presented a r = -0.42* 

with Alox and no significant correlation with Feox (n = 30). Eivazi and Tabatabai (1990), when 

evaluating the effect of metals in the ?G activity, found that Al and Fe could inhibit its activity up 

to 45 and 32 %, respectively. Rao and Gianfreda (2000) and Rao et al. (2000), studding the 

interaction between soil AP enzymatic activity with Al and Fe, observed a 45 % reducing effect on 

its activity when interacting with Al and no effects when interacting with Fe. 

Figure 3.5 - Logarithmical regression of the enzymatic activities versus Alox and Feox content: a) ?-glucosidase (?G) 

versus Alox + Feox; and b) acid phosphatase (AP) versus Alox + Feox. 

The present results do not elucidate if OC accumulation in soils derived from volcanic 

material is favored by: (i) the protection of SOM by the Al and Fe compounds, as pointed out by 

Kunito et al. (2016), lowering its availability for mineralization; (ii) or by the inhibition of ?-

glucosidase activity by Al and Fe, lowering the mineralization efficiency by microbes. However, 

it is clear, in both hypotheses, the determinant role of Al and Fe compounds on OC accumulation 

in the studied volcanic soils.

Although soils are subjected to periodic inorganic P fertilization, the AP activity seems not 

being inhibited by the applied P. As shown in Figure 3.6, a positive linear regression of AP against 

Pi is observed (r = 0.57**, n = 30) when all the 30 samples are considered. When the regression is 

established with the weighted averages of the 6 soils, no relationship is observed (r = 0.06ns).  

Figure 3.6 - Linear regression of acid phosphatase (AP) versus inorganic P (Pi) for all samples (n = 30) and for the 

weighted average of each soil (n = 6). 

These results contradict the reported inhibition of AP by the presence of phosphate anion 

(Dick et al., 2011) and the observations of Juma and Tabatabai (1978), authors who reported an 

inhibition effect of soil phosphatases activity due to the presence of soil applied P. This apparent 

contradiction may be explained by the fact that the observations made by Juma and Tabatabai 

(1978) were done within the same soil, while the present results respect to 6 six different soils and 

30 different samples. On the other hand, the soil characteristics of both studies are substantially 

different. Borie and Zunino (1983) have already reported that AP activities are usually very high 

in andic soils due to: (i) protective effect of Al and Fe compounds on AP and; (ii) the low P intensity 

in soil solution, even when they are fertilized, which is related with the high P retention capacity 

of these soils. 

Therefore, different P retention capacities of soils may overlap the inhibition of AP activity 

promoted by Pi, since applied Pi in andic soils can be readily fixed by Al and Fe compounds, thereby 

reducing its availability in soil solution. Once more, the lower slopes presented by Haplic and 

Placic Andosols for the relationship between AP and Po, of about 7 times less than for Vitric 

Andosols (Figure 3.4c), suggest again a lower substrate availability (Po) in the former soils, as a

possible consequence of their higher content in extractable Alox and Feox (Table 3.1). Otani and Ae 

(1997) reported that labile Po in andic soils can be also fixed by Al and Fe in a similar manner to 

labile Pi. 

3.4.3 - P acquisition effort 

Nutrient availability in soil can be expressed by calculating the acquisition effort by 

microbial extracellular enzymatic activity. The ratio of P to C enzyme activities (AP: ?G), the so-

called P acquisition effort, translates the energy allocation made by microorganisms to acquire P 

through extracellular enzymes (Moro et al., 2015), providing information about the soil nutrient 

availability (Sinsabaugh and Shah, 2012). Haplic and Placic Andosols have higher ratio, weighted 

average of 12, than Vitric Andosols, 5.6, showing nearly twice the effort (Table 3.2), and both 

values are much higher than those indicated by Sinsabaugh et al. (2010) in soils that span 40 

ecosystems from the river Mississipy, Misouri, Ohio and the Great Lakes (an average of 1.6). 

Nevertheless, Moro et al. (2015) assessed values with the same magnitude for soils derived from 

volcanic materials. The AP: ?G ratio presents a high inverse correlation with Pi, Pi-Olsen and P-

CaCl2 (r = -0.76***, -0.78*** and -0.71***, n = 30), Figure 3.7a, 3.7b and 3.7c, in accordance 

with the results presented by Moro et al. (2015) when relating the AP:?G ratio versus soil Pi-Olsen. 

But a high positive correlation is observed with active Alox + Feox contents (r = 0.85***, n = 30), 

Figure 3.7d. 

These results suggest that the effort for the acquisition of P, through the allocation of energy 

to produce AP enzymes, decreases when available P exists at levels able to supply microorganism 

and plants homeostasis and full development needs. So, when Al and Fe are present at higher levels 

(Haplic and Placic Andosols), high values of AP: ?G ratio are expected since P retention is higher, 

resulting in low Pi availability, leading to a more intense production and exudation of AP to 

mineralize soil Po. In Japanese acidic Andosols, Kunito et al. (2012) have already lead to equivalent 

conclusions, observing that the high phosphatase activity is due to low P availability. In these soils, 

microbial communities produce large amounts of phosphatase to ensure an adequate P supply, 

resulting in an increase of activity in P-limited soils.

Table 3.2 - Weighted average ratio of different assessed soil parameter. 

a microbial effort for enzyme production/exudation; b potential activity of C and P acquisition; c potential activity of 

C:P acquisition. 

Relating soil AP: ?G ratio with plant P availability and uptake, Moro et al. (2015) reported 

values between 3.9 and 9.5 for cabbage field plots subjected to P fertilization. Their results indicate 

the potential usefulness of this index also for agronomic purposes, since the higher values of AP: 

?G were observed on plots where no P was applied, where the crop also presented the lower yield 

and the lower P contents in the aerial biomass. 

Based on the same principles, another approach has been proposed by Sinsabaugh and 

Moorhead (1994) and Sinsabaugh and Shah (2012), using the concepts of potential activity for C 

acquisition and for P acquisition, ln(?G) and ln(AP), respectively, and defining the potential of C:P 

acquisition as the  ln(?G):ln(AP) ratio. This potential of C:P acquisition measures the different 

energy resource partition between organic P acquisition and growth (Sinsabaugh et al., 2008). 

As expected from AP and ?G relationship (Figure 5a), ln(?G) versus ln(AP), are highly 

correlated (r = 0.90***, n = 30). Studying nutrient acquisition in soils and sediments, Sinsabaugh 

et al. (2010) indicated a slope of 1.16. Waring et al. (2014) performed a meta-analysis to explore 

energetic and stoichiometric constraints on enzyme production in tropical soils with low P 

bioavailability. These authors also found a high linear correlation (r = 0.80***, n = 57) between 

potential C acquisition and potential P acquisition, with a slope of 1.18. The higher value achieved 

in our study, 1.40, is consistent with the low bioavailability P in soils derived from volcanic 

materials (Sinsabaugh et al., 2012).

regression of  acid phosphatase (AP) to ?-glucosidase (?G) ratio versus Alox + Feox content. 

Concerning the potential of C:P acquisition (ln(?G):ln(AP)), its value is expected to be 

higher when lesser energy effort is directed to P acquisition (AP: ?G), being both indices highly 

correlated (r = -0.93***, n = 30) in our soils. Therefore, the potential of C:P acquisition is positively 

affected by the inorganic P pools and negatively affected by Alox and Feox contents, in accordance 

with Allison (2006) and Sinsabaugh and Shah (2012) and the present results referred previously 

(Figure 3.7). In the case of the regression with Alox + Feox, the relationship is much closer (Figure 

3.8, r = 0.90***, n = 30) than with AP: ?G (Figure 3.7d). Considering that active Al and Fe bond 

to SOM (Dahlgren et al., 2004), repressing the activity of AP (Kunito et al., 2016), the results 

suggest that active Al and Fe are involved in the decreasing of the potential C:P acquisition activity 

(r = -0.86***, n = 30) on these soils.

Figure 3.8 - Linear regression of potential of C:P acquisition (ln(?G):ln(AP)) versus Alox + Feox extractable content, n 

= 30; in dashed line the threshold for energy shift for P acquisition. 

 Sinsabaugh et al., 2010 also indicated the average of 0.95 for soils (n = 929) as the threshold 

value below which the energy resource allocation shifts towards organic P acquisition over growth 

utilization. In the present study, all the observed values are much lower (Figure 3.8), either for the 

weighed mean of the Haplic and Placic Andosols (0.66) and Vitric Andosols 0.75 ratio (Table 3.2), 

as for each individual layer (between 0.74 and 0.91). Therefore, these lower ratios indicate, once 

more, the low mineral P bioavailability of these soils, which leads to an intense AP production and 

tends to shift the energy partition from growth towards P acquisition and homeostasis maintenance, 

especially on the Haplic and Placic Andosols, with higher levels of extractable Alox and Feox. Thus, 

the limitation on the size of the soil microbial biomass through the energy restriction for microbial 

growth may also contribute for the OC accumulation in these soils. 

Cleveland and Liptzin (2007) pointed out an average value of 186 (166 for pasture soils) 

for the molar C:P ratio and Sinsabaugh et al. (2010) considering this value as the threshold value 

above which  a P limitation may occur. In our work, it was observed that Vitric Andosols show a 

value of 84 for the molar C:P ratio, lower than the average value (145) observed for the Haplic and 

Placic Andosols (Table 3.2). Vitric Andosols show lower P acquisition effort, when compared to 

Haplic and Placic Andosols that have higher Al and Fe contents, being related to the observed 

lower C:P ratio in Vitric Andosols (Table 3.2). Therefore, it seems that the average C:P ratio of 

186, pointed by those authors, as a general threshold value, needs to be adjusted for soils derived 

from volcanic materials. In these conditions, the abundance of Al and Fe compounds are

3.5 - Conclusions 

Based on the available results, the following conclusions may be presented: 

- The management of the soils for the past 20 years (no-till and grazing) led to a strong 

increment of all the analyzed parameters (OC, Po, Po-Olsen and ?G and AP activities) on 

the 2 cm top layers, when compared with the 10-15 cm layers; 

- Organic P represents about 54 % of the soils Pt content, being highly correlated with OC; 

- No general correlation was observed between Po-Olsen and Po or OC, although significative 

linear relationships have been established for two different groups of soils under study; 

- Activities of soil ?G and AP in all the 30 samples were positive and highly correlated with 

the presence of substrates, respectively OC and Po; 

- Active compounds of Al and Fe exert a determinant effect over the analyzed parameters; 

- Accumulation of OC and Po are more closely related with Feox than with Alox. Only for Po 

it was found a significant linear and positive correlation with both Alox and Feox; 

- Activitiy of soil ?G is repressed by both Alox and Feox, being the effect of Alox much closer 

related to enzyme activity than that of Feox; 

- Activity of soil AP seems to be only affected by Alox, since no significant relationship was 

observed with extractable Feox; 

- The effort for P acquisition (AP: ?G activity ratio) and the potential of C:P acquisition 

(ln(?G):ln(AP)) are both affected by the Pi pools and by Al and Fe contents. Therefore, for 

the maintenance of the homeostasis condition, the energy allocation to produce AP enzymes 

decreases when available Pi exist at levels able to supply growth requirements. On the 

contrary, when Al and Fe minerals are abundant and Pi retention is high, the energy 

allocation shifts to the production of AP enzymes to mineralize soil Po and affecting the 

microbe growth rate; 

- The presence of abundant and crescent inorganic phosphate itself is not a condition for the 

inhibition of soil AP activity, since its activity in different soils also depends on their 

capacity for P retention; 

- The inhibition effect of inorganic phosphate on the soil AP activity is also dependent on the 

soil P retention capacity;

- All the referred effects of active Al and Fe on (i) the accumulation of OC and Po, (ii) the 

repression on BG and AP activities, (iii) the increase on the resource allocation on P 

acquisition, are more evident on Haplic and Placic Andosols due to their higher content on 

those minerals, than in the Vitric Andosols; 

- the general C:P molar ratio threshold value for energy resource partition between growth 

and P acquisition probably needs to be adjusted for soils derived from volcanic materials.

4.1 - General conclusions 

Several cases of watershed eutrophication are well identified in the Azorean archipelago, 

namely in Pico island. In this island, about 40 % of the land is used for pasture proposes, and 

superficial P fertilization without incorporation is the main practice, even in situations with steep 

slopes. Simultaneously, the high P retention capacity is one of the characteristic of volcanic 

materials derived soils, due to their richness in active Al and Fe, which reduces P availability for 

plant uptake. The observed Al and Fe richness seems to be also involved in the high OC content 

accumulated in the superficial layers of these soils, through repressing microbial and enzyme 

activity and/or protecting organic matter from mineralization. 

Regarding the P vertical distribution in these soils altered by fertilized pastures, it was 

observed a stratified gradient along the profile for the different P pools, consequence both of the 

superficial application of fertilizers without incorporation into the soil, and their high adsorption 

capacity. Haplic and Placic Andosols, richer in extractable Alox and Feox contents presented lower 

Pi contribution to their Pt, when compared to Vitric Andosols. 

Despite the high P content assessed by the Olsen soil P test, ammonium lactate and CaCl2, 

which were above the agronomical threshold limits, they still present values below the 

environmental threshold values estimated either by the desorbed P in 0.01M CaCl2 suspensions or 

by their degree of phosphorus saturation (DPS). In fact, the DPS of the six soils under study 

presented values ranging from 5.1 to 15.2 %, below the more conservative limit of 25 %. Vitric 

Andosols presented higher DPS values when compared to the remaining soils classes, which seems 

to be related with their lower Alox and Feox contents. Due to their low ability to desorb P, the 

obtained results suggest that soils may not represent themselves a risk of P losses into to 

freshwaters. Therefore, it needs to be considered the hypothesis of a direct runoff of the 

superficially applied fertilizers before dissolution, particularly rainfall events in the steepest slope 

pastures. If true, the fertilizer application with deep-banding systems in longer periods of time may 

be a solution, as an alternative to the interdiction of the use of fertilizers on the most sensitive and 

hilly areas of the watersheds. 

A decrease of organic carbon (OC) contents was observed along the profile, in all soils 

under study, as a result of the superficial accumulation of crop residues and faeces deposition, since

they were used for grazed grassland and they were not tilled for the past 20 years. Active Alox and 

Feox are positively related with OC, which may be interpreted as a protective role of those 

compounds over a substantial pool of the OC, decreasing the rate of its mineralization. Po represents 

about 54 % of the soils P content, and since labile Po forms may be tightly bound to Al and Fe 

compounds, in a similar manner to Pi, it may be also protected from mineralization by 

microorganisms. Vitric Andosols showed lower OC accumulation, due to their youth or a faster 

mineralization, as they have lower Al and Fe contents. Since soils with different characteristics 

after disturbance undergo through changes in the native OC, a segregation of soils was observed 

between labile Po and Po or OC. Labile Po, extracted by Olsen methodology,  represents about 1.9 

% of the total Po, and its content was higher than Pi-Olsen in 53 % of the soil samples. Therefore, 

further studies concerning Po-Olsen may contribute to advances in soil test procedures and 

interpretation, when assessing potential plant available P. 

Regarding the ?-glucosidase (?G) and acid phosphatase (AP) enzyme activities, it was 

observed that the 0-2cm up layers show always the higher rates, 562 and 2938 µg p-NP g-1 h-1, 

respectively. Similar to OC and Po, both enzymes presented a gradient along the studied profile 

depth. Vitric Andosols presented a higher average ?G activity, approximately twice the activity 

(296 µg p-NP g-1 h-1) when compared to Haplic and Placic Andosols (143 µg p-NP g-1 h-1). Activity 

of AP ranged between 1278 and 1719 µg p-NP g-1 h-1, being their average rates for both soil groups 

more similar than for ?G activity. Both activities were highly correlated to each other, and also 

between ?G versus OC and AP versus Po.  

Negative correlations of ?G or AP activity with extractable Alox or Feox were obtained, 

suggesting a repression effect promoted by these compounds, being this effect more pronounced 

with active Al than with Fe. On the other hand, and being the soils subjected to periodic mineral P 

fertilization, it was not observed an inhibition of AP activity due to the accumulation of P on the 

different pools. Soil P concentration regulates the AP production and release from cells by genetic 

expression through Pi signal transduction pathway, according to environmental signals, that is the 

abundance of exogenous and endogenous P pools. Therefore, an explanation may be related to the 

high P retention capacity of Andosols, which seems to overlap the inhibition of AP activity 

expected from the abundance of Pi. 



Chapter 4 - General Conclusions 

 

87 

 

Concerning the P acquisition effort by microbial population, Haplic and Placic Andosols 

have an higher ratio of P to C enzyme activities (AP:?G) than Vitric Andosols. Consequently, the 

P acquisition effort made by microbes seems to be higher on the former groups of soils. In contrast 

to what was reported for AP activity itself, it was observed a significant and negative correlation 

among AP:?G and the different with Pi pools, especially in the case of labile Pi-Olsen content (r = 

0.78***, n = 30), and a significant and positive correlation with active Alox+Feox. Therefore, the 

results corroborate that the effort for P acquisition, through energy allocation to produce AP 

enzymes, only decreases when available P exists at levels able to ensure microorganism 

homeostasis condition and full development needs. On the opposite, the higher Alox and Feox 

contents are (Haplic and Placic Andosols), the higher AP:?G ratio is expected, since P retention 

leads to a low Pi availability, resulting in a more intense production and exudation of AP to 

mineralize soil Po.  

A significant correlation was observed between potential C acquisition (ln(?G)) and 

potential P acquisition (ln(AP)), and its high value (1.40) of the b constant (slope) is consistent 

with the low P bioavailability in soils derived from volcanic materials. Once more, the results 

obtained suggest that active Al and Fe are involved in the decreasing of the potential C:P 

acquisition (ln(?G): ln(AP)), since this potential of C:P acquisition is positively affected by the Pi 

pools and negatively affected by Alox+Feox. 

Concerning the potential C:P acquisition (ln(?G): ln(AP)), all the obtained values were 

below the referred threshold value indicated in the bibliography (0.95), below which the energy 

resource allocation shifts towards organic P acquisition over growth use. Once more, the obtained 

results suggest that active Al and Fe are involved in the decreasing of the potential C:P acquisition, 

since this potential is positively affected by the Pi pools and negatively affected by Alox+Feox. 

Consequently, lower values of the potential C:P acquisition were observed on the Haplic and Placic 

Andosols, consistent with its lower mineral P bioavailability, which led to an intense AP production 

and to a shift of energy partition from growth towards P acquisition and homeostasis maintenance. 

Therefore, the limitation on the size of the soil microbial biomass through the energy restriction 

for microbial growth may also contribute for the OC accumulation in these soils. 



Chapter 4 - General Conclusions 

 

88 

 

In accordance to their Alox and Feox contents, Vitric Andosols show a lower P acquisition 

effort when compared to Haplic and Placic Andosols. However, both groups present a lower molar 

C:P ratio than the general threshold value of 186 pointed out by several authors, above which soils 

present P limitations. Therefore, the present results also seem to indicate the need of a different 

critical value more adjusted for soils derived from volcanic materials. 

Lastly, the results do not elucidate if OC accumulation is favored (i) by the protection of 

SOM by the Al and Fe compounds, lowering its availability for mineralization or; (ii) by the 

repression of ?G activity by the same compounds, lowering the mineralization efficiency by 

microbes or (iii) by the limitation of energy to microbial growth, reducing the size of the soil 

microbial biomass compartment. However, it seems to be clear, in all the three hypotheses, the 

determinant role of Al and Fe compounds on OC accumulation on the soils derived from volcanic 

material.
