resumo 
 
 

Este trabalho é dedicado à análise das propriedades de transporte, 
termomecânicas e eletroquímicas de materiais óxidos com estrutura do tipo 
perovskite e de compósitos para utilização como ânodo em pilhas de 
combustível de eletrólito sólido (PCES), com funcionamento a temperaturas 
intermédias, utilizando eletrólitos de galato e de silicato de lantânio. De entre 
os materiais estudados, destacam-se os sistemas à base das perovskites 
A(Mn,Nb)O3-? (A = Sr, Ca) e (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3, os cromitos de lantânio 
substituidos por catiões aceitadores de electrões e com valência mista e os 
compósitos do tipo “cermet” contendo Ni. É dada ênfase à estabilidade e 
estutura destes materiais, bem como à microestrutura das camadas porosas 
dos elétrodos e de cerâmicos densos, à condutividade eletrónica, ao 
coeficiente do Seebeck, à permeabilidade de oxigénio, à expansão térmica e 
química e à sobretensão anódica dos elétrodos depositados nas membranas 
de eletrólitos à base de (La,Sr)(Ga,Mg)O3 e La10(Si,Al)6O27.  Numa seleção dos 
estudos efetuados incluiu-se a avalia?ão da difusão de oxigénio, do estado de 
oxidação dos catiões dos metais de transi?ão relevantes para o transporte 
deeletrões, da atividade catalítica dos aditivos e das camadas protetorasde 
céria introduzidas no modelo das celulas eletroquímicas. A correla?ão entre as 
propriedades de transporte dos materiais de ânodo e o comportamento 
eletroquímico dos elétrodos porosos indica que os fatores principais, 
responsáveis pelo desempenho dos ânodos, incluem, em particular, a 
condutividade eletrónica das composi?ões dos ânodos e a difusão de catiões 
entre as fases do eletrólito sólido e do elétrodo. Este último fator é 
especialmente crítico no caso das membranas à base de silicato de lantânio, 
prejudicando significativamente as propriedades dos ânodos, quando 
comparadas com as das células eletroquímicas fabricadas com galato de 
lantânio como o electrólito sólido. Os resultados obtidos neste trabalho 
permitem escolher as composições dos ânodos que possuem os valores da 
resistividade por área do eléctrodo mais baixos, comparativamente a alguns 
materiais análogos já estudados, tal como (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-?.

abstract 
 

This work was focused on the analysis of transport, thermomechanical and 
electrochemical properties of a series of perovskite-like oxide materials and 
composites for potential applications as anodes of intermediate-temperature 
solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with lanthanum gallate and silicate solid 
electrolytes. The primary attention was centered on A(Mn,Nb)O3-? (A = Sr, Ca) 
and (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-based systems, lanthanum chromite substituted with 
acceptor-type and variable-valence cations, and various Ni-containing cermets. 
Emphasis was given to phase stability of the materials, their crystal structure, 
microstructure of porous electrode layers and dense ceramics, electronic 
conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, oxygen permeability, thermal and chemical 
induced expansion, and anodic overpotentials of the electrodes deposited onto  
(La,Sr)(Ga,Mg)O3- and La10(Si,Al)6O27- based electrolyte membranes. In 
selected cases, roles of oxygen diffusivity, states of the transition metal cations 
relevant for the electronic transport, catalytically active additives and doped 
ceria protective interlayers introduced in the model electrochemical cells were 
assessed. The correlations between transport properties of the electrode 
materials and electrochemical behavior of porous electrodes showed that the 
principal factors governing anode performance include, in particular, electronic 
conduction of the anode compositions and cation interdiffusion between the 
electrodes and solid electrolytes. The latter is critically important for the silicate-
based electrolyte membranes, leading to substantially worse anode properties 
compared to the electrochemical cells with lanthanum gallate solid electrolyte. 
The results made it possible to select several anode compositions exhibiting 
lower area-specific electrode resistivity compared to known analogues, such as 
(La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-?.

Introduction 
 
Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) provide advantages over other energy conversion engines due to high 

power output, fuel flexibility, environmental safety, capability to utilize exhaust heat etc. One of actual 

problems related with SOFCs is performance degradation attributable to high-temperature interaction 

between the cell components or microstructural instability of the electrode layers [1-6]. Consequently, 

reducing the operation temperature of the fuel cell is one of priority tasks. Since significant performance 

losses originate from insufficient electrochemical activity of the electrodes, especially pronounced at low 

temperatures due to high activation energies of rate-determining processes, significant efforts are focused on 

the search of optimum electrode compositions exhibiting high and stable performance. Conventional Ni-

containing composite anodes suffer from chemical, mechanical and microstructural instability [1, 2, 4, 7] 

which requires search of alternative materials possessing high and stable performance. In last years, selected 

perovskite compositions have been proposed as promising candidates capable to substitute the cermets for 

electrochemical applications [8-13]. However, the information on relationships between the anode material 

composition, its functional characteristics and electrochemical activity is scarce and contradictive. 

As discussed in Chapter 1, the choice of materials is restricted to oxide-based compositions, 

primarily those with the perovskite-like structure. The selection of the objects is associated with the stability, 

thermomechanical, transport and electrochemical characteristics of the materials as well a wide variety of 

dopants capable to modify their properties and optimize the anode behavior. Moreover, recent studies 

revealed a potential of so-called “symmetric cells” with the cathode and anode composed of the same 

material, in SOFC technology [9, 14]. In particular, fewer number of the materials utilized facilitates the 

procedure of the cell preparation, reduces the costs and enables to switch the cathode and anode atmosphere 

in order to eliminate carbonaceous species deposited in hydrocarbon-containing atmospheres while periodical 

alternation of p(O2) and current direction might avoid irreversible degradation of the electrode layer. 

While promising characteristics have been observed on (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Ti,Mn)O3-?, 

(La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Cr,Ni)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Cr,Ru)O3-? anodes [8, 10, 15-18], in most studies the anodes 

were covered with catalytically-active metal pastes which can barely be utilized in industrial scale. On the 

other hand, the presence of the additional layer obscures the electrochemical properties relevant to the oxide 

material and does not allow to evaluate the relationships between the anode performance and the bulk 

properties of the anode material. Selected compositions, such as Nb-doped manganites, are suggested to 

possess acceptable anode properties [19, 20], although no reports on their electrochemical behavior have 

been found. In a search of potential anode materials, the present study is focused on characterization and 

evaluation of the electrode activity of the relative compositions, such as (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-?, 

(La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-?, Sr(Mn,Nb)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Cr,Mg,Ni)O3-? and corresponding 

composites. 

Another strategy of the work is to evaluate the potential of lanthanum silicate-based materials as 

solid electrolytes in SOFCs. In recent years this group of compositions with apatite-type structure has 

received much attention due to their satisfactory transport characteristics and low costs [21-24]. However, the 



10 

 

available information on electrochemical properties of apatite-based cells is scarce and requires further 

investigations, especially in terms of the long-term stability. 

The present study is focused on synthesis, characterization and assessment of the electrode activity 

of perovskite-type chromite-, manganite- and titanate-based compositions and studying the relationships 

between the electrode properties and functional characteristics. With respect to the goals indicated above, the 

particular tasks are as follows: 

1. Analysis of available data on the functional characteristics and electrochemical properties of 

chromite-, manganite- and titanate-based compositions. 

2. Characterization of perovskite-like (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-?, Sr(Mn,Nb)O3-?, 

(La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Cr,Mg,Ni)O3-? as potential electrode materials. Evaluation of 

electrochemical activity and stability of the perovskite-based cathodes and anodes. 

3. Comparative assessment of the anode activity of cermet or oxide-based anodes in contact with 

apatite- and gallate-based solid electrolytes, evaluation of performance-determining factors. 

4. Analysis of the correlation between stability, transport, thermomechanical properties of perovskite-

based materials and performance of the corresponding anodes. 

In accordance with the tasks of the study, the work is composed of five chapters. Chapter 1 is 

devoted to a survey of the available literature data on the possible groups of SOFC anode materials based on 

the binary oxides or oxide-based compositions, primarily with the perovskite-type structure. The stability and 

transport properties of the potential anode materials under operation conditions restrict their choice to 

chromites, titanates, selected manganites stabilized by introduction of donor-like cations as well as to some 

representatives of double perovskites, primarily based on molybdates. The overview of the electrode 

materials involves the consideration of the phase and structural relationships, mixed electronic and ionic 

conductivities, thermomechanical characteristics, analysis of the electrochemical behavior and the 

applicability of the corresponding anodes for practical utilization in hydrogen or natural gas-based fuels. 

Possible limitations associated with specific features of the given group of materials are considered as well. 

The description of the experimental techniques, characteristics of the apparatus used, methods of 

synthesis of the materials studied and fabrication of the electrode layers is presented in Chapter 2. In this part 

the methods of calculation of physico-chemical parameters and routes of the treatment of the experimental 

data are also considered. 

Chapters 3 and 4 are devoted to investigation of chromite- and manganite-based materials, 

respectively. The characterization includes structural and microstructural studies, assessment of the phase 

relationships associated with the behavior of the materials on thermal or redox cycling, evaluation of the 

parameters related to the mixed electronic and ionic conductivity. In terms of the electrode behavior, anodic 

and in some cases cathodic activity is considered, without any detailed analysis of the factors responsible for 

the electrochemical properties, routes of optimization of the anode performance etc. 

Chapter 5 is focused on comparison of the anode properties of mixed-oxide and some metal-ceramic 

(cermet) anodes, assessment of the relationships between the electrode behavior and stability or transport 

properties of the anode/electrolyte materials. In order to provide more complete information on the 

phenomena related with the electrolyte utilized, a brief review of the stability and transport characteristics of 



11 

 

apatite- and gallate-based solid electrolytes known from the literature is presented. As a possible route to 

optimize the anode performance, selected electrode layers were impregnated with catalytically-active species; 

another approach involved preliminary deposition of the protective ceria-based layers on the electrolyte 

surface to avoid the interaction and cation exchange between the cell components. 

The principal conclusions based on the results obtained are presented in a separate section. The 

symbols and abbreviations, as well as the references used are listed in the end of the work.

1. Literature review. Functional properties of chromite-, manganite- and titanate-

based perovskite oxides for SOFC anode applications. 

 
1.1. Stability limits and transport properties of transition metal oxide compounds: a brief 

overview 
 

In order to achieve high and stable performance of the SOFC, the anode material should satisfy a list 

of requirements. These, primarily, include chemical and microstructural stability under the operation and 

fabrication conditions, high electronic and ionic conductivity, chemical and thermomechanical compatibility 

with solid electrolytes, high and stable electrochemical activity towards fuel oxidation and low cost [1-4]. By 

far, no ideal compound or composite material has been found to satisfy all the requirements. 

In literature, one can found a large number of studies devoted to development of anodes alternative 

to commonly used Ni-containing cermets, mainly based on complex oxides possessing the perovskite-type 

structure. Prior to analyzing their behavior, it would be reasonable to consider some of characteristics of 

individual oxides, since the properties of the binary compounds may have a strong influence on the 

characteristics of their derivatives. Moreover, some of the individual oxides satisfy most of the requirements 

to the anodes and may be considered as the electrode component or a precursor for the electrode fabrication. 

The advantage of individual oxides relates to their low cost and simplicity of production. Numerous 

oxides possess mixed electronic and ionic conduction which is beneficial for the electrochemical 

applications. Unfortunately, direct comparison of the functional characteristics, primarily conductivity and 

vapour pressure under operating conditions, is complicated due to poor availability of the literature data. 

The comparison will be restricted by 3d, 4d and 5d transition metals and selected representatives of 

4f elements. The most s- and p-elements are stable in an unique oxidation state ([25, 26] and references cited) 

and an acceptable level of the electronic conduction in these elements may be expected only in metallic state 

which cannot be attained under the anode environments. Another concern relates to a high tendency of these 

elements to form volatile products, especially in wet atmospheres [26-29]. 

Most oxides of elements of IIB, IIIB, IVB groups (Sc2O3, Y2O3, ZrO2, ZnO etc.) as well as 4f- and 

5f-elements are also stable in their maximum oxidation state in a wide domain of conditions [25, 26], with 

resultant negative effect on the electron transfer. Therefore, their transport properties are mainly determined 

by the presence of defects or impurities in the crystal lattice rather than by intrinsic properties of the parent 

oxide. On the other hand, these oxides and their derivatives may offer a relatively high level of the ionic 

conductivity [26, 30, 31]. Utilization of oxides of 4f- and 5f-elements as anodes is limited by their low 

availability, high prices and, in case of 5f-elements, complexity of production and nuclear instability. 

Most elements of VIIIB group (Rh, Ru, Pt, Os, Ir, Pd) and IB group (Ag, Au) are characterized by 

stability in metallic state under a wide range of p(O2) [26, 32, 33]. Due to high electronic conductivity and, in 

some cases, electrochemical activity, some representatives have been assessed as components of composite 

anodes [32-35]. However, industrial application of these metals is restricted by their high price, low 

availability, tendency of metallic particles towards sintering and adsorption/dissolution of hydrogen with 

resultant deterioration of the transport, mechanical or electrochemical characteristics [15, 36-38]. 



13 

 

Being stable under the anode conditions, metallic Fe, Co, Ni, Cu are susceptible to formation of 

oxides at higher p(O2) [25, 39-42]; the corresponding conditions of the oxidation are shown in Fig. 1.1.1. 

While oxides with low oxygen content (FeO1±?, Cu2O1±? etc.) still possess an acceptable level of the 

electronic conduction (Table 1.1.1), subsequent oxidation may deteriorate the transport properties and cause 

irreversible dimensional changes, microstructural degradation, etc. Another concern relates to fragility of Fe, 

Co, Ni in H2 atmosphere [57-59]. 

MnO1±? is stable in a wide domain of conditions  including the anode atmosphere. The composition 

exhibits the p-n transition in a broad p(O2) range (~10
-10-10-4) atm [26] and an occasional oxidation is 

assumed not to influence critically the transport behavior. On the other hand, oxidation of MnO1±? into 

Mn3O4±? occurring at 10
-10-10-11 atm at 1073 K (Fig. 1.1.1) is undesirable since  the formation of the new 

phase may cause strong and irreversible volume changes. The processing conditions of MnO1±?-based anodes 

are restricted by low melting point of metallic Mn (~1473 K at 10-19 atm [25]); this factor should also be 

accounted for when operating with unstable Mn-based compositions which produce MnO1±? under reducing 

conditions. At the same time, at small amounts of MnO1±? phase, the formation of the liquid phase may 

ensure the adhesion of the electrode to electrolyte. This indicates the preferability of manganites compared 

with pure MnO1±?.

Cr2O3 is the unique Cr-O binary compound stable at elevated temperatures [25, 26, 42]. The 

conductivity is essentially p(O2)-independent under oxidizing and moderately reducing conditions due to 

small variations of the oxygen content. At low oxygen partial pressures, the determination of the conductivity 

is complicated by a strong volatility of Cr-containing compounds and a slow equilibration between the solid 

and gas phase. Moreover, the conductivity behavior is strongly affected by the presence of donor- and 

acceptor-type impurities in Cr2O3; examples are shown in Table 1.1.2. Whatever the transport mechanism, 

basically the conductivity of Cr2O3-based materials does not exceed 1 S/cm which is insufficient for the 



15 

 

anode applications. Another concern is related with the vaporization of chromia-based compounds; this 

phenomenon and related problems will be discussed in Chapter 1.2.7. 

A promising group of oxides for potential anode applications is represented by Ti, V, Nb, W oxides. 

Under extremely reducing conditions and elevated temperatures shown in Fig. 1.1.1, oxides TiO1±?, VO1±?, 

NbO1±? exhibit a metallic-like conduction, while in anode environments TiOx, VOx, NbOx and WOx are n-

type conductors; both mechanisms are favorable for electrochemical applications. Similar to Cr2O3, the 

conductivity is strongly dependent of the presence of impurities in the cation sublattice. At the same time, the 

practical utilization of this group of oxides as well as studying their transport characteristics is complicated 

by a large variety of phases existing at different M:O ratio [26, 42, 66, 68, 69]. The phase transitions on 

oxidation (Fig. 1.1.1) are accompanied by strong irreversible drops of the conductivity (Fig. 1.1.2) and 

dimensional changes. Interaction of V-, Nb-, Ta-containing phases with hydrogen causes the deterioration of 

mechanical properties (toughness, plasticity) [59, 70, 71].

Among 4f-elements, one may emphasize the behavior of CeO2-? and its derivatives due to promising 

combination of the stability, electronic and ionic transport properties and catalytic activity towards 

electrochemical processes. Pure and doped CeO2-? have been widely studied as individual anodes or as 

components of anode composites. Detailed characterization of the oxides may be found elsewhere [72-75]. 

One of the most critical disadvantages of doped CeO2-? for anode applications is insufficient electronic 

conductivity which requires the presence of metallic phase in the composite, and a high chemical expansivity 

on redox cycling which necessitates lowering its fraction in anodes [74, 76, 77]. 

The domain of operation conditions for most d-element oxides is restricted by the formation of 

volatile compounds. As evaluated by Sfeir at al. [44], the losses of a substance can be considered significant, 

if the partial pressure of volatile species exceeds 10-8 atm. The volatilization is essentially critical for Cu-, 

Ag-, Au-, MoOx- and WOx-containing anodes [27, 28, 78-80]. At the presence of VOx- and Cr2O3-based 

phases, an oxidation of the anode material in wet atmosphere should be avoided [78, 79, 81-85]. In some 

extent, the volatilization of Mn-, Fe-, Co-, Ni-containing compounds might be problematic [27, 78, 80], 



16 

 

while electrodes containing NbOx phase should be operated at temperatures lower than 1573-1673 K [86]. 

Apart from the loss of the material, the vaporization may result in microstructural degradation, especially for 

liquid phase-assisted processes. Subsequent precipitation of the volatile species into the electrode porous 

structure may block the pores or cause mechanical failure of the layer, while deposition from the gas phase 

onto the surface of other components of the cell may cause their poisoning; examples of chromia-related 

contamination will be presented in Chapter 1.2.7. 

The functional characteristics of individual oxides may be modified by appropriate doping with 

donor- or acceptor-type cations. Among this group of materials, CeO2- and ZrO2-based materials have 

received much attention, since due to their adequate ionic conductivity, thermomechanical properties, 

contribution into the electrochemical processes, etc., the related oxides may be utilized both as electrolytes 

and constituents of the composite electrodes ([73, 87-89] and references cited). As for other oxide-based 

materials, one should mention the studies on NbOx-, TiOx-based solid solutions [90-92] which properties are, 

however, strongly affected by the processing conditions. Although their electrochemical activity has been 

reported to be insufficient for practical applications, one should not underestimate the potential of this type of 

materials since a wide choice of dopants enables to find an optimum combination of the stability, transport 

and mechanical properties. 

Wide possibilities may be achieved by fabrication of oxide-based compositions with the structure of 

perovskite-related phases, spinels, pyrochlores, etc. Among possible combinations of mixed oxides 

composed of large-size cations in so-called A-sublattice (mainly alkali-earth or rare-arth cations) and small 

cations in B-sublattice (transition metal cations), we will briefly consider Ti-, Mn-, Fe-, Ni-, Co- Ti-, Nb- and 

W-based composition where the molar ratio A:B differs from 1. Characteristics of selected compositions in 

terms of stability, conductivity and electrode activity are presented in Fig. 1.1.1 and Tables 1.1.2, 1.1.3. 

Although the reduction stability of manganites, ferrites and other oxides with Ruddlesden-Popper 

(RP) structure (Ln,A)n+1BnOx (where Ln is rare-earth metal, A is an alkali-earth metal and B is a transition 

metal element) is somewhat improved in comparison with perovskite analogues (Fig. 1.1.1), the level of the 

electronic and ionic conductivity is rather small to consider these materials as anodes [48, 93-95]. 

(La,Ca,Sr,Ba)0.6NbO3-?-based phases with tungsten bronzes-like structure generally exhibit sufficient level of 

the electronic conductivity which may even be superior compared with corresponding perovskites [96-98]. 

However, the performance of the bronze anodes studied in [98] is poor, while the problems associated with 

stability, interaction with YSZ, oxygen diffusion limitations associated with ordering phenomena due to high 

cation vacancy concentration, and extremely low TEC values [98] significantly constrict their utilization. 

Regardless these disadvantages, some research in the field of electrochemical characteristics of perovskite-

related layered phases and tetragonal bronzes has been carried out [95, 99-101]. 

Pylochlore-type materials (Gd,Ca)2Ti2O7-? might be considered as an alternative to titanate 

perovskites due to their high stability in a wide p(O2) range which ensures their tolerance towards oxidation. 

The materials exhibit dominant oxygen ionic conductivity, while the comparatively low electronic 

contribution and catalytic activity necessitate distribution of metallic phases, ceria-based compositions, 

surface modification, etc. [108-102].

The lattice of perovslites is tolerant towards cation substitution, while their transport properties are 

generally better compared with other families, like spinels, pyrochlores or garnets. Analysis of the low-p(O2) 

stability limits (Fig. 1.1.1) restricts the choice of the perovskite-type anode materials to chromites, titanates, 

molybdates and vanadates. Moreover, appropriate doping of ferrites and manganites with a cation which 

ensures the low-p(O2) stability without substantial deterioration of the transport and catalytic properties 

enables to consider these compounds as another group of potential anode materials. 

Among the perovskite compounds, in the present study the primarily attention will be focused on 

chromite, titanate and manganite groups, since ferrites and cobaltites are insufficiently stable in fuel 

conditions [46-49]. Some authors report application of thermodynamically unstable perovskites such as 

(La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-? as SOFC anodes [101] or catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation [118, 121]. One should 

note, however, that the requirements for catalyst materials differ from those to anodes, in particular in terms 



19 

 

of the electrocatalytic activity, compatibility with solid electrolytes, etc, while catalysts can generally be 

prepared and replaced by a simpler technology which imposes less stringent requirements to their stability. 

Another large group of potential anodes includes vanadate-based perovskites [110, 111, 122] and 

the perovskites with large fraction (?50 mol.%) of V, Mo, Nb. In particular, attractive characterisctics have 

been reported for A2(B,Mo)O6-? ordered perovskites, where A is alkali-earth metal and B corresponds to Mg 

or transition metal cation [123-126]. Perovskite-type materials containing V, Mo, Nb etc. cations are 

regarded especially promising when working with S-containing fuels; however, their mechanical and 

transport characteristics are strongly susceptable to redox cycling [20, 111, 117, 127-130].  Nevertheless, a 

moderate content of these cations in chromites and manganites may ensure the optimum combination of the 

functional properties; the related compositions will be considered in the following sections. 

 

1.2. Chromite-based perovskite solid solutions 
 

1.2.1. Solubility of dopants 

 
Solid solutions of perovskite LnCrO3-? are formed for Ln = La - Lu, Y, except for cerium which 

forms chromites stable only under reducing conditions [131]. In La2O3 - Cr2O3 system, LaCrO3-? is the only 

single phase compound [132]. The perovskite chromites of various lanthanides are similar to each other and 

are characterized by a relatively narrow field of the forming solid solutions [131]. The stability of LnCrO3-? 

decreases with lowering Ln ionic radius; the trend is especially obvious under reducing conditions [17]. 

Alkaline-earth cations are most common dopants for chromites, mainly due to their acting as 

electron acceptors on the Ln or Cr sites and resultant contribution to the p-type electronic conductivity. 

Among dopants, Ca, Sr and in some cases Ba were studied as A-site substitutions. Mg is more appropriate for 

B-site doping due to its smaller radius [133]. In accordance with [44, 132, 134], the solubility of Ca in 

LaCrO3-? varies from 12% at 923 K to 50% at 1673 K. Single phase perovskites may be synthesized at 

(La+Ca)/Cr ratio in the range of 0.96 - 1.04 [135]. Annealing at p(O2) = 10
-9 atm at 1873 K decreases the 

solubility limit down to 22% [132]; the worse stability of (La,Ca)CrO3-? at low p(O2) is confirmed in [134]. 

Considering other lanthanide chromites, Ln1-xCaxCrO3-? is stable at 0?x?0.4 for Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Y; 

0?x?0.2 for Ln = Tb and 0?x?0.15 for Ln = Yb ([131, 136] and references therein). 

An excess of Ca results in formation of La2O3, CaO, CaCrO4, Ca3(CrO4)2, Ca5(CrO4)3OH in air [44, 

132]. The phases La2O3, CaO, ?-CaCr2O4, Ca(CrO2)4 and RP-chromites ((La,Sr)2CrO4, (La.Sr)3Cr2O7, 

(La,Sr)4Cr3O10) were identified in Ca-rich (La,Ca)CrO3-? under reducing conditions [132]. Strong oxidation 

of (La,Ca)CrO3-? causes formation of Cr
6+ species on the surface and segregation of La2CrO6 and Cam(CrO4)n 

phases. The process is promoted by higher Ca content, lower temperature and higher p(O2) [132, 137, 138]. 

Sr is assessed to have worse solubility in LaCrO3-? than Ca, consistently with larger difference in 

ionic radii between La and alkali-earth cation. The data on solubility limit of Sr are more scattered, possibly 

due to discrepancies in the preparation procedure or slower equilibration in La2O3-SrO-Cr2O3 system 

compared with Ca-containing analogues [132, 139]. The latter factor can be attributed to smaller ionic radii 

and higher mobility of Ca cations [133, 140]. As reported by Peck et al. [139], Sr is soluble up to 10% at 



20 

 

1223 K in air, while other authors indicated a higher solubility of Sr: 15% at 1073 K [141] and 20% at 1173 

K [138]. After sintering at elevated temperatures (1673 K) and subsequent quenching, the solubility limit of 

Sr increases up to 25% [44, 139]. Ln1-xSrxCrO3-? are single phase perovskites at 0?x?0.15 for Ln=Pr, Eu and 

0?x?0.05 for Ln = Tb, Y [131]. In opposite to Ca-doped chromites, Sr solubility is reported to increase on 

reduction from 10% in air to 31% at 10-9 atm (under strong vacuum conditions) [44, 139]; however, one 

should account for large difference between the synthesis temperature in both studies. The authors attribute 

the improved stability under low p(O2) to formation of RP-chromites which achieve a fast equilibrium with 

the perovskite phase, in contrast to SrCrO4 and Sr2.67(CrO4)2 phases dominant in air. The dominant secondary 

phases in La1-xSrxCrO3-? are SrCrO4, Sr2.67Cr2O8, La16Cr7O44, Sr5(CrO4)3OH in air [44, 139] and La2Sr2O5, 

La4SrO7, Sr2CrO4, Sr(CrO2)2, Sr(CrO2)4 and RP-chromites at low p(O2) [139, 142]. 

Formation of single phase perovskites Ln1-xBaxCrO3-? was observed at 0?x?0.1 for Ln = La, Pr; 

0?x?0.05 for Ln = Eu, Gd, Tb, Y [131, 143]. The low solubility of Ba may be attributed to both large 

difference in ionic radii between Ba and Ln cations and high stability of BaCrO4 and BaCr2O4 phases which 

are frequently present as impurities in Ba-rich chromites [143, 144]. 

Generally, LnCrO3-? are orthorhombic perovskites exhibiting a phase transition into the 

rhombohedral structure at ~563 K; no transition up to at least 1173 K was observed on PrCrO3-?, NdCrO3-?, 

SmCrO3-?, YCrO3-? [131, 145-147]. Ca-doping allows to increase the transition temperature [131, 148]; this is 

consistent with the similarity of Ca2+ and La3+ ionic radii. Increasing Ca content in La1-xCaxCrO3-? up to x = 

0.5 is predicted to produce the cubic perovskite structure [135]. Introduction of large Sr and Ba atoms 

reduces the temperature of the orthorhombic-rhombohedral transition and promote the stabilization of the 

rhombohedral structure ( 3R c ) at room temperatures [131, 143, 149]. 

Due to the small radius, Mg is incorporated into B-sublattice; attempts to obtain A-site substituted 

(Ln,Mg)CrO3-? result in formation of MgCr2O4 spinel [143]. Depending on Ln cation radius and preparation 

conditions, the solubility limit of Mg in LnCr1-xMgxO3-? is assessed to be 0?x?0.4 ([131] and references 

therein). For LaCr1-xMgxO3-? the maximum Mg content was found to be 46% in air and 7.5% at p(O2) = 10
-16 

atm at 1573 K [142], while for NdCrO3-? the limit is 25% at 1173 K [150]. At least 20% of Mg can be 

introduced into La0.8Sr0.2Cr1-xMgxO3-? [151]. An excessive Mg content may cause precipitation of MgO phase 

at the grain boundaries [142]. Under reducing conditions, Mg solubility in LaCrO3-? is evaluated as &gt;10% 

[17]. Mg-doped chromites generally possess the orthorhombic struture [142, 150] transforming into the 

rhombohedral symmetry on reduction [112]. 

The series of La0.9Ca0.1Cr1-xAlxO3-? with 0?x?0.9 was studied in the p(O2) region 10
-21 - 1 atm [152], 

while the electrochemical properties of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Al0.5O3-? were studied in air and in wet 5% H2 [9], with 

no emphasis on the phase stability. In YbCrO3-? Al is soluble up to 0.35 [131]. Doping with Al enables to 

stabilize the rhombohedral structure at low temperatures [153, 154]. 

Ti has unlimited solubility in B-sublattice of (La,A)(Cr,Ti)O3-? (A = Ca, Sr), provided that the 

introduction of Ti is compensated by appropriate acceptor doping or creation of A-site vacancies [155-157]. 

At Ca:Ti&amp;lt;1, the formation of secondary intergrowth phase Lan(Ti,Cr)nO3n+2 can be observed. The materials 

are orthorhombic perovskites (S.G.: Pbnm) for Ca(Sr) and Ti content lower than 60 - 70 mol.% [156, 158] 

and exhibit a stability at least down to 10-21 atm, with Ti solubility increasing on reduction [146, 155, 159].

At least 5 mol. % of V can be doped into La0.85Sr0.15Cr1-xVxO3-? [160] and La0.8Ca0.15Sr0.05Cr1-xVxO3-? 

[161] forming perovskites with rhombohedrally-distorted structure. The solubility of V may be enhanced by 

reduction or acceptor doping. The formation of single phase Ce0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5V0.5O3-? under low p(O2) with 

tetragonal structure was reported. However, high V content may induce phase transitions on oxidation or 

reduction, detrimental for the electrochemical applications [162]. An excess of V in (La,A)(Cr,V)O3-? (A = 

Ca, Sr) causes formation of A3(VO4)2-based phases [160, 161, 163]. 

Mn, Fe and Co have been reported to have unlimited solubility in LaCrO3-? or in (La,A)CrO3-? under 

atmospheric conditions and with moderate amount of alkali-earth dopants [131, 164-166]. The composition 

LaCr0.8Co0.2O3-? was shown to consist of a mixture of orthorhombic LaCrO3-?- and rhombohedral LaCoO3-?-

based phases [167], while at other ratios Cr/Co single phase perovskites are produced. Similar mixtures of the 

orthorhombic and rhombohedral phases were found for LaCr0.4Mn0.6O3-? [168] and for 

La0.33Sr0.67Cr0.33Fe0.67O3-? [169]. 

Mn-, Fe-, Co-substituted chromites are unstable towards high content of alkali-earth dopants or 

oxygen deficiency. Depending on the cation composition, the stability limits may be located close to anodic 

conditions. In most studies, the decomposition or low-p(O2) equilibration is hindered kinetically which 

results in discrepancies between the literature data on the phase stability or crystal structure. As an example, 

a precipitation of metallic Co from LaCr0.9Co0.1O3-? at 10
-18 - 10-16 atm at 1273 K was reported [146], while 

no decomposition of La0.7Ca0.3Cr0.8Co0.2O3-? was detected under similar conditions [170], although the high 

quantities of Ca and Co should destabilize the structure. While LaCr0.5Mn0.5O3-? exhibits a separation of 

traces of La2O3 in wet H2 [171], (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? are stable in typical anode atmospheres [8, 10], despite 

the expected destabilization induced by introduction of Sr. 

LaCr1-xMnxO3-? preserve the orthorhombically-distorted structure for 0?x?0.5, while for x?0.7 the 

material adopts the rhombohedral symmetry [168, 171]. The data on the crystal structure of reduced LaCr1-

xMnxO3-? are scarce due to insufficient phase stability; according to Deleebeck et al. [171], in wet H2 

LaCr0.5Mn0.5O3-? becomes cubic. LaCr1-xFexO3-? perovskites form a series of solid solutions with 

orthorhombic crystal lattice in air, typical for both end members [172, 173]. 

Increasing Co content in LaCr1-xCoxO3-? above x = 0.25 causes rhombohedral distortion of the 

structure [167, 173]; the behavior of Mn- or Co-doped chromites is consistent with the symmetry of 

orthorhombic LaCrO3-? and rhombohedral LaMnO3-? and LaCoO3-? [49, 131, 174, 175]. The orthorhombic 

and rhombohedral structure is preserved on reduction of LaCr1-xCoxO3-? with 0?x?0.15 and 0.25?x?0.4, 

correspondingly, while for 0.5?x?0.8, high oxygen losses induce formation of cubic perovskites [167]. 

Similar to (La,Sr)CrO3-?, La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.9B0.1O3-? (B = Mn, Fe, Co) are rhombohedral perovskites 

[176]. Increasing Mn content up to 50 mol. % preserves the rhombohedral structure [9, 113, 131, 177], while 

for Fe-doped analogues, the symmetry transforms into the orthorhombic one [9, 178]. 

A gradual phase transition rhombohedral-cubic is observed for La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? at 770 - 

1270 K [177]. The rhombohedral structure of La1-xSrxCr0.5Mn0.5O3-? with x = 0.2 is maintained on reduction 

in wet 5% H2, while the compositions with x = 0.25 and x = 0.3 exhibit a transformation into the 

orthorhombic and cubic structure, respectively [113]. La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-? is orthorhombic in air. On 

reduction, traces of metallic Fe can be detected, while the perovskite adopts the rhombohedral symmetry [9, 



22 

 

178]. Increasing Cr content in La0.3Sr0.7Fe1-xCrxO3-? above 33% may induce formation of SrCrO4. Subsequent 

reduction results in dissolution of SrCrO4 phase, with simultaneous formation of Fe(Fe,Cr)2O4 spinel and 

precipitation of metallic Fe [169, 179]. 

Ni has a limited solubility in chromites which increases at lower T and higher p(O2) [131]. The 

composition with ~60 mol. % of Ni was found to consist of LaCrO3-?- and LaNiO3-?-based phases [180]. In 

LnCr1-xNixO3-? (Ln = Gd, Yb), Ni can be dissolved up to x = 0.15 [131]. The stability of La(Cr,Ni)O3-? under 

reducing conditions is reported for 50 - 60 mol.% of Ni at 1173 - 1273 K [181, 182], although the phase may 

be stabilized kinetically. LaCr1-xNixO3-? are orthorombic perovskites at x&lt;0.6 and rhombohedral at x&gt;0.7 at 

room temperature [181]. The phase transition shifts to lower temperatures on Ni-doping [183]. Introduction 

of A-site acceptor-type dopants and/or reduction decrease the solubility of Ni in (Ln,A)(Cr,Ni)O3-? down to 

10 - 20 mol. % [184, 185]. Reduction induces subsequent lowering of Ni solubility, although the 

determination of exact values is difficult due to kinetic reasons. The formation of submicron Ni particles at 

low p(O2) is important in terms of potential electrochemical applications [17, 184, 186]. For La1-xSrxCr1-

yNiyO3-?, the transition orthorombic-rhombohedral occurs at x = 0.2 - 0.25 and y = 0.05 - 0.1 under ambient 

conditions [176, 187]. 

Similar to Ni-doped chromites, an attention was attracted by Ru-containing analogues due to their 

electrocatalytic activity. Up to 20 - 25 mol.% of Ru can be accommodated by La0.8Sr0.2Cr1-xRuxO3-? [15, 188]. 

 

1.2.2. Key defect chemistry mechanisms 

 

The basic relationships of the defect chemistry of chromites can be found elsewhere [134, 146, 189, 

etc.]. Here, 3 simplified possibilities will be considered which include (La,A)CrO3-? and La(Cr,B)O3-? 

perovskites where A and B are dopant cations with a fixed oxidation state, and La(Cr,B)O3-? where B is a 

transition metal cation with variable valence.  

Replacement of 3-fold charged lanthanum cations

La
A? , 

O
V
ii  and 

Cr
Cr

i . The distribution of the defects in the chromite crystal lattice is considered to be random, 

in accordance with [152, 190], while no structural transitions are taken into account. Although in literature 

one can find a possibility of existence of chromium or oxygen interstitials or cation vacancies ([131, 191, 

192] and references cited) in chromites, these aspects will not be addressed. 

The charge compensation via formation of 
Cr

Cr
i  species is realized in a wide p(O2) range, including 

the atmospheric conditions, while the formation of oxygen vacancies dominates at lower p(O2). The 

relationship between the defects can thus be expressed by equation of charge conservation: 2? + p = x, where

Eq. (1.2.2) assumes a linear relationship between log ? and log p(O2) for ?&lt;&lt;x/2, with the 

proportionality coefficient equal to -½, as shown on the inset in Fig. 1.2.1. Since variations of the oxygen 

deficiency in oxidative atmospheres are below 10-2, the absolute value of the oxygen content is nearly p(O2)-

independent in a wide range of oxygen pressures. Therefore, the electronic conductivity in this domain of 

p(O2) is essentially unaffected by reduction while the the ionic conduction and chemically-induced strains 

which are proportional to the deficiency, are low. Further reduction induces a gradual decrease of the oxygen 

content; the proportionality between log ? and log p(O2) is preserved. The onset of extensive oxygen losses is 

determined by the nature and amount of A-site dopants and by temperature, being shifted to more oxidative 

conditions on heating or increasing the dopant content. 

As shown in Fig. 1.2.1, the oxygen losses observable on Ca- and Sr-doped chromites are close, with 

(La,Sr)CrO3-? exhibiting slightly larger oxygen deficiency [134, 190]. This may be attributed to a larger cell 

volume of Sr-substituted chromites which facilitates the oxygen losses, or stronger tendency of rhombohedral 

structure to the formation of oxygen vacancies. At extremely low p(O2), the dependence log ? vs. log p(O2) 

deviates from the linearity, while the absolute value of oxygen content approaches the value corresponding to 

complete reduction of Cr into 3+. Obviously, for La1-xAxCrO3-? the limiting value of oxygen 

nonstoichiometry should be equal to x/2.  However, in practice, this saturation for most chromites occurs in a 

region of extremely low p(O2) located beyond the experimental conditions (unless B-site substituted 

chromites are reduced) or stability domain of the perovskites.

of chromites is determined by the population of Cr4+ species. Therefore, in the region of large oxygen losses,

If LaCrO3-? is doped into B-sublattice by a 2-fold charged cation, with the oxidation state stable 

within the experimental conditions (i.e. Mg2+), the basic equations are similar to (La,Sr)CrO3-?. In accordance 

with the coexistence of 3 types of species (Cr3+, Cr4+ and B2+), the equilibrium constant of the process Eq.

  (Eq. 1.2.4) 

 

The similarity between Eqs. (1.2.2) and (1.2.4) assumes that the behaviour of Mg-doped chromites 

should not essentially differ from that of A-site substituted (La,A)CrO3-? considered previously. The 

nonstoichiometry curve still exhibits 2 saturations and one continuous drop of oxygen content. Similar to the 



25 

 

1st situation, the low-p(O2) saturation corresponds to complete reduction of Cr into 3+ state, with the 

corresponding assymptotic value of oxygen deficiency equal to y/2. 

B-site doping induces larger variations of the oxygen content variations then substitutions into A-

sublattice (Fig. 1.2.2). Even doping of cations with relatively high oxidation state accompanied by equivalent 

introduction of acceptor-type dopants shifts the onset of oxygen losses to higher p(O2) [152, 191]. This may 

be attributed to comparatively weak B-O bond strength and more significant destabilization of the structure 

by B-site doping. Obviously, replacement of Cr with cations stable with oxygen coordination lower than 

octahedral should increase the effect of the doping.  

The last case considered involves the situation when both B-site cations possess variable oxidation 

state under working conditions. For simplicity, the situation when only 2 oxidation states can be realized for 

both cations will be considered. Apart from the relationships valid for the previous situations, the transition 

metal cations participate in the process of electrone exchange with the equilibrium constant

Combination of Eqs. (1.2.2) and (1.2.5) with modified conditions of lattice site and charge 

concervation yields 6 equations with 6 variables. The system can be solved analytically, but the final 

expression is rather complex. In practice, the proposed model is generally complicated by numerous factors; 

among those one may emphasize the following: 

1. Most d-elements may adopt more than 2 oxidation states, involving the process of charge 

disproportionation under the experimental conditions [10, 191, 194]. 

2. Extensive oxygen losses may induce phase decomposition or structural transformations, while the 

coexistence of 2 or more phases significantly affects the equilibration kinetics [146, 191]. 

3. The presence of lattice defects may impose constrictions on their cation or anion environment due to 

electrostatic or steric factors [152]. 

In some studies, the defect model of chromites doped with transition metals is simplified; the most 

common assumption relates to neglecting the electron exchange and considering chromium or the dopant 

cation to be stable in a definite oxidation state. Although this approach satisfactory describes the data 

presented in works [191, 196, 197], more studies on perovskite systems are required in order to make certain 

conclusions about the processes responsible for the behavior of doped chromites. 

 

1.2.3. Total conductivity 

 

The conductivity in LnCrO3-? is essentially electronic; the ionic transference numbers are less than 

10-4 [131, 198]. The electronic transport in chromites proceeds by hopping electron holes along Me-O-Me 

network in B-sublattice (p-type conductivity). Chromites are characterized by relatively strong electron 

localization on Cr atoms [199] which favors small polaron conduction and enhanced activation energies of 

the hole mobility. In the absence of structural transformations, the isothermal conductivity should be 



26 

 

governed by the population of charge carriers which is equivalent to the concentration of 
Cr

Cr
i . 

Correspondingly, the basic trends shown in the previous section can be applied for characterization of the 

electronic transport behavior. 

Preparation conditions strongly affect the transport properties. This may originate from incomplete 

synthesis, oversintering, volatilization of Cr-containing species at high temperatures ([131, 134] and 

references therein). The scattering between the literature data is especially strong for undoped LnCrO3-?, 

where the content of charge carriers is mainly governed by the presence of impurities [200]. LaCrO3-?-based 

materials exhibit a degradation of the conductivity [141, 201], especially pronounced at low p(O2). 

LaCrO3-?-based perovskites generally exhibit larger conductivity under ambient conditions 

compared with other lanthanides, as shown in Fig. 1.2.3. The conductivity of LnCrO3-? decreases in the row 

La&gt;Nd&gt;Y&gt;Sm [131]. This behavior correlates with the corresponding activation energies and is attributed to 

higher overlapping integral of the d- and p-orbitals of chromium and oxygen atoms, respectively, and faster 

hole mobility for larger Ln radius. Kunifusa et al. [150] reported the conductivity of NdCrO3-? to be 

significantly higher compared with LaCrO3-? [199] and YCrO3-? [202], although the activation energy is 

minimum for LaCrO3-? (0.20 eV vs. 0.22 - 0.23 eV for other chromites). In some studies, a higher 

conductivity of PrCrO3-?-based perovskites in comparison with other LnCrO3-? analogues in air or under 

reducing conditions was reported [136, 184]. 

Ce-containing chromites show a drastic change of the activation energy of the electronic 

conductivity in air with temperature (0.15 eV in low-temperature vs. 0.20 - 0.25 eV in the high-temperature 

region) [203]. The difference in the slopes decreases on introducing Ca, presumably due to an effect of the 

equilibrium between Ce4+/3+ and Cr4+/3+ on variations of the temperature and resultant change of the content 

of mobile charge carriers, although the low stability of Ce-containing chromites in air and the possibility of 

the phase transition should also be considered [131, 204]. 

The conductivity of (Ln,A)CrO3-? where A is an alkali-earth metal gradually increases with the 

acceptor dopant amount. This trend is limited by separation of secondary  non-conductive phases at high 

doping levels, in particular those containing Cr6+ species [132, 134, 139]. The conductivity of Ca-doped 

chromites is generally slightly higher as compared with Sr-doped analogues [112, 134, 143] (Fig. 1.2.3). Ba-

doping seems to result in strong lattice strains which hamper the electronic transfer [143] compared with Ca- 

or Sr-doped counterparts. This behavior is consistent with the ionic radii of the alkali-earth metals, with Ca 

possessing the radius close to that of La3+ and smaller resultant lattice distortions [133, 134, 143]. 

Mg-doping enhances the conductivity, although the effect is smaller compared with Sr and Ca. 

Apart from increasing the amount of p-type charge carriers, introduction of Mg results in lower content of Cr 

atoms available for the electron transfer and blocks Cr-O-Cr bonds [114, 134]. 

Al-doping suppresses the conduction of chromites due to blocking of conductive Cr-O-Cr paths and 

by facilitating oxygen removal from chromites on reduction [152, 153, 205]. On the other hand, Al-doping 

into acceptor-rich chromites should increase the amount of Cr4+ species. As an example, introduction of 12 

mol. % of Al into La0.75Ca0.25Cr0.92-xCo0.08AlxO3-? slightly enhances the conductivity in air and reduces the Ea 

down to 0.11 eV [154], possibly due to structural factors.

Fig. 1.2.3. Temperature dependencies of total conductivity of chromites in air 

 

The effect of introduction of transition metal (Mn, Co, Fe, Ni, Cu) into B-sites of chromites on the 

electronic transport is controversial, while the approaches to describe the electronic state of transition metal 

cations are significantly different. Basically, available data on the total conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, 

oxygen nonstoichiometry, XPS studies suggest that the electronic transfer either dominates by hole migration 

over B-O-B network (where B is the transition metal dopant) with preservation of the stable state Cr3+ [113, 

167, 189, 191] or involves participation of chromium species in the redox equilibrium [10, 17, 164-166, 170, 

189, 206, 207]. In particular, slight doping LaCrO3-? and (La,Sr)CrO3-? with Mn/Co sharply decreases the 

conductivity in air and enhances the corresponding activation energy [164-166, 170]. This behavior assumes 

that the hole transfer in moderately doped chromites proceeds over Cr atoms while isolated Mn3+/Co2+ 

cations act as hole traps. At higher Mn or Co content (~30% for La(Cr,Mn)O3-?) Mn-O-Mn paths become 

percolating which increases the conductivity and diminishes the corresponding activation energy. The 

equilibrium between Cr4+/Cr3+ and Mn4+/Mn3+/Mn2+ species was considered to analyze the temperature and 

p(O2) dependence of the conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of (Ln,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? [10]. In 

(Ce,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-?, Cr atoms are regarded as only hole traps, without significant contribution into the 



28 

 

electronic transport [207]. Whatever the transport mechanism, the conductivity values in air exceed 10 - 20 

S/cm at 973 K for (Ln,A)(Cr,Mn)O3-? with Mn content  above 40 - 50% and for (Ln,A)(Cr,Co)O3-? with Co 

content higher than 10% [8, 10, 164-166, 170] (Fig. 1.2.3). Introduction of Ni or Fe into LaCrO3-? or 

(La,A)CrO3-? monotonously increases the conductivity in air and decreases the activation energy [131, 183], 

although the stability of Ni-rich chromites is arguable [131] and the corresponding data were obtained in O2 

[183]. Cu-doping within the solubility limit also increases the conductivity in air [131, 134]. 

In view of potential anode applications, much attention is focused on low-p(O2) conductivity, since 

the electrocatalytic properties are generally governed by the transport characteristics. The conduction at 

reduced p(O2) is determined by both the conductivity in air and the reducibility of the composition and 

resultant drop of the amount of charge carriers; selected examples are shown in Figs. 1.2.4, 1.2.5 and Table 

1.2.1. Obviously, in order to achieve a reasonable low-p(O2) conductivity, one should find the optimum 

content for each dopant to ensure the high concentration of the charge carriers and moderate reducibility of 

the perovskite. Because of differences in the preparation conditions of the materials, measuring procedure, 

uncertainties in the literature data, we will give only a brief overview of basic trends observed on reduced 

chromites, and discuss their applicability as anodes in terms of the electronic transport.

Consistently with the trends in the nonstoichiometry, the electronic conductivity of LaCrO3-?-based 

perovskites shows a p(O2)-independent behavior in oxidizing and moderately reducing atmospheres; for 

chromite perovskites with a modest degree of substutution, the sufficient level of the electronic transport may 

be extended down to the anodic conditions [112, 135, 184, 214]; in particular, the onset of LaCrO3-?

decomposition is observed at ~10-21 atm at 1273 K [46]. This region is followed by the conductivity drop 

characterized by the proportionality between the conductivity and p(O2)
1/4. The slope may be reduced for 



30 

 

transition metal-doped chromites (Figs. 1.2.4 - 1.2.5) in the case of electron exchange between the 

corresponding redox couples [8, 113, 184, 209]. The onset of the drop is determined by the nature and 

amount of dopants and temperature. 

The maximum low-p(O2) conductivity of (La,Ca)CrO3-? and (La,Sr)CrO3-? is observed for ~20 

mol.% of the acceptor (Table 1.2.1) [112], although the exact knowledge of p(O2) is required for more 

accurate conclusions. For slightly doped (La,A)CrO3-?, the conductivity of Ca-containing chromites is 

somewhat higher, while doping above 10% results in higher conduction of (La,Sr)CrO3-? [112, 143]. The 

conductivity of Ba-substituted LaCrO3-? is substantially lower; taking into account the poor stability [143], 

this material is inappropriate for anode utilization. 

Mg-doping negatively influences the low-p(O2) transport properties due to a substantial conductivity 

drop originating from extensive oxygen losses [112]. On the other hand, introduction of bivalent Mg atoms 

may improve the oxygen ionic conduction and suppress the chemical expansion. Introduction of small 

amounts of Ni, Co, Fe, Mn or noble metals is considered to be a promising way to improve the 

electrocatalytic activity, since the conductivity remains on the level 1 - 10 S/cm at partial oxygen pressure of 

10-20 - 10-15 atm (as shown in Table 1.2.1), while formation of small quantities of metallic or oxide phases 

should not be detrimental for the electron transport characteristics (Table 1.1.1). High amounts of the dopants 

result in a degradation of the conductivity with time, possibly associated with phase instability [17, 210]. 

The donor dopants decrease the high-p(O2) conductivity and may annihilate the positive effect 

induced by the presence of acceptor cations [155, 157, 159, 215]. At the same time, the introduction of 

donors may improve the low p(O2) transport. For example, the conductivity of (La1-xCax)yCr1-zTizO3-? is 

significantly influenced by Ca:Ti ratio. Unless affected by kinetic factors, the conductivity basically exhibits 

a p-n transition: in the high p(O2) region Ti is essentially in +4 state while the electron transport proceeds via 

hole hopping over Cr3+ and Cr4+ species. On further reduction, the formation of Ti3+ starts contributing while 

Cr is essentially in +3 state; this combination provides the n-type transport behavior, although the existence 

of equilibrium amounts of Ti3+ and Cr4+ in the high- and low-p(O2) range, respectively, should also be 

accounted for more accurate analysis of the conductivity mechanism. Increasing La or Ti content or lowering 

the A-site deficiency results in shifting the p-n transition to more oxidative region. However, these trends 

may be obscured by the slow equilibration kinetics, especially typical for Ti-rich perovskites. The n-type 

conductivity, typical for ferrites, was also observed on Fe-doped chromites with large quantities of Fe at low 

p(O2), when the contribution of Fe
3+/Fe2+ couple is realized (Fig. 1.2.5). Depending on the composition and 

experimental conditions, the conductivity of (La,A)(Cr,Fe)O3-? may achieve 5 - 10 S/cm at low p(O2) [212].  

 

1.2.4. Thermal and chemical expansion 

 
The data of the thermal expansion of chromites are contradictory; this primarily relates to undoped 

LnCrO3-? perovskites (Table 1.2.2) since their functional properties are strongly affected by the preparation 

technique, measurement procedure, purity of the material and other factors. Basically, in LnCrO3-? series the 

thermal expansivity behavior is consistent with Ln radii [131, 185, 203] showing the maximum thermal 

expansion coefficients (TEC) for LaCrO3-?.

expansion behavior of undoped LnCrO3-? is expected to be p(O2)-independent [112] due to negligible oxygen 

losses, the thermomechanical properties may be affected by other factors influenced by p(O2), such as the 

presence of minor amounts of transition metals, temperature- or p(O2)-induced phase transitions, Cr 

volatilization in oxidative or H2O-rich atmospheres, formation of Cr
6+ species in oxidizing conditions, etc. 

Introduction of alkali-earth cations into A-sublattice increases TECs, as shown in Table 1.2.2. Since 

the radius of Ca ions is close to that of La, the higher expansion may be related with the phase transition or 

more extensive oxygen losses [131, 225]. The effect of facilitated formation of oxygen vacancies on thermal 

expansion is consistent with the correlation observed between the TEC and oxygen nonstoichiometry [131, 

194, 226]. The same factors should also contribute to the expansion of Sr- and Ba-doped chromites; in 

combination with their larger ionic radii and shifting the phase transition to lower temperature, the TEC 

values are higher compared with Ca-doped analogues. The expansivity is partially suppressed by increasing 

fraction of relatively small Cr4+ ions with alkali-earth dopant content; this is supported by a decrease of the 

cell parameters of A-site doped chromites at room-temperature on doping [112, 143, 153]. 

Mg introduction into B-sublattice of LaCrO3-? increases the thermal expansion, consistently with 

larger ionic radius of Mg2+ in comparison with Cr3+ and Cr4+ [112]. The TECs of chromites doped with 

alkali-earth cations are in the range (8.0 - 12.0)×10-6 K-1, which is close to those of commonly used solid 

electrolytes [72, 227, 228]. Introduction of transition metal cations into B-cites of perovskite lattice of 

chromites basically results in an enhanced thermal expansion (Table 1.2.2); this may be attributed to larger 

ionic radii of the guest ions, structural transitions, easier reducibility of the corresponding cations or that of 

Cr4+ [8, 153, 179, 229]. The expansion behavior may also be influenced by electron exchange between the 

transition metal cations [10, 207], variations of the spin state of cations [153] or other factors. Whatever the 

effect, the TECs remain moderate on doping with Al, Ti, Mn. Limited solubility of Ni, Cu, Zn in chromites 

[131, 181] also enables to keep the expansion below the critical level. Introduction of large amounts of easily 

reducible Fe and Co atoms in combination with A-site acceptor doping may increase TECs above 20×10-6 K-1 

[131, 179, 213] which is inappropriate for fuel cell applications. 

Similar to other perovskite groups containing transition metal cations, chromites generally exhibit 

an expansion on reduction. The isothermal expansion behavior of chromites was studied by numerous 

authors; the volume changes were attributed to increasing coulombic repulsion between charged cations close 

to a vacancy [194, 233], variation of the radius of transition metal ions [194, 196, 234-236], phase transitions 

[8, 236], microstructural phenomena or segregation/dissolution of impurities [169, 233, 235]. 

In subsequent equations, the value of absolute oxygen deficiency ? will be used instead of more 

correct ?? which characterizes relative changes of the oxygen content. This simplification is based on 

observations that chromites are nearly stoichiometric under high-p(O2) conditions [190, 197]. As observed in 

numerous studies, the chemical expansion ?ch exhibits nearly linear dependence on the oxygen deficiency ?, 

with the proportionality factor k represented by averaged linear expansion coefficient:

In the model proposed in [234], following assumptions were suggested: 1. mobile holes are located 

on transition metal cations; 2. a closely packed lattice of oxides is formed by ions with rigid spheres; 3. the 

expansion is isotropic in each of 3 directions. According to this approach, the generalized equation for the 

expansion is as follows

where ci and ri are the concentration and ionic radii, correspondingly, of i
th ion of ABO3-? perovskite. The 

subscript 0 relates to the reference state (which generally corresponds to the stoichiometric compound for 

chromites) at given temperature. 

In accordance with [196, 234], the value ?ch/? should be essentially independent on temperature and 

alkali-earth dopant nature and amount. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1.2.6, the expansion behavior vs. ? is 

temperature-independent within the experimental errors. However, comparison of (La,Sr)CrO3-? and 

(La,Ca)CrO3-? shows that the strains are slightly larger for Ca-substituted chromites and enhance with dopant 

level. In framework of the model in [234], the effect of dopant nature may be attributed to larger Sr radius 

compared with Ca, while higher dopant amount yields more Cr4+ species in stoichiometric perovskites. Both 

factors decrease the denominator in Eq. (1.2.7) for higher dopant content and for Sr-substituted chromites.

Fig. 1.2.7. Isothermal dependencies of relative elongation of chromite-based ceramics vs. p(O2) 

 

Regardless of the effects indicated, the difference between the value ?ch/? for the examples above is 

not substantial, and the expansion behavior should generally correlate with that of oxygen nonstoichiometry 

variations. As shown in Figs. 1.2.6 - 1.2.7, the expansion is promoted by higher acceptor content and 

elevated temperature. LaCrO3-?-based materials exhibit larger expansivity compared with other LnCrO3-? 

counterparts [160, 193, 233]. An exception was observed on Ce-doped chromites, where reduction of Cr4+ is 

suppressed by formation of Ce3+. As the influence of changes in A-site cation radii on the expansion is 

smaller, the presence of Ce4+/Ce3+ couple is suggested to have a buffering effect on the expansivity [203]. 

As follows from Eq. (1.2.7), the value ?ch/? decreases on introduction of Mg or other acceptor-type 

dopants into B-sublattice. The effect of B-site doping into chromites on the expansion behavior is more 

substantial compared with substitutions in A-sublattice, as shown in Figs. 1.2.6 - 1.2.7. Al, Ga-doping into 

chromites shifts the onset of the expansion towards oxidative conditions, consistently with facilitated oxygen 

losses [152, 235]  (Fig. 1.2.7). 

The effect of doping with cations with strong reducibility is less obvious. Basically, the preference 

of a dopant to lower oxidation state is expected to provide larger oxygen losses and expansivity, as was 

observed for Mn-, Co-, Ni-, Cu-doped chromites. On the other hand, Fe-doped chromites exhibit surprisingly 

lower chemically-induced strains decreasing with Fe content. Apart from possible experimental errors, the 

effects of the electron exchange between the cations, charge disproportionation, ordering phenomena, phase 



35 

 

transformations or spin state transitions on reduction [8, 10, 207, 237, 238] could also be responsible for the 

behaviour observed. One should also account for possible formation or dissolution of secondary phases and 

microstructural factors, which result in slow equilibration or mechanical failure [163, 169]. Whatever the 

expansion-determining factors, introduction of reducible cations into chromites suppresses the expansivity of 

(La,A)CrO3-?. On the other hand, doping with B-site cations shifts the onset of the length changes towards 

oxidative conditions (Fig 1.2.7). 

The data on the expansion of chromites indicate that this group of perovskite materials possesses a 

moderate level of the thermally- and chemically-induced strains, in comparison with conventional Ni-YSZ 

anodes [239-241]. The parameter ?chem/? in chromites is basically lower compared with fluorites [237] which 

ensures their lower sensitivity to nonstoichiometry variations caused by p(O2) changes or polarization, in 

comparison with, for example, CeO2-based cermet anodes. Taking tensile modulus of chromites as 150-200 

GPa and Poisson ratio as 0.3 [242], an expansion of 0.25 - 0.3% in isothermal conditions will cause the 

stresses 500 - 800 MPa, increasing on reduction [194]. Obviously, application of chromite-based anodes 

ensures their better chemical and thermomechanical compatibility with chromite interconnects. 

 

1.2.5. Oxygen diffusivity 

 

The process of the oxygen ionic transfer in perovskites ABO3-? is governed by the passage of an 

oxygen anion through a bottleneck formed by a triangle A-B-A with A and B atoms located in the 

neighboring positions ([243] and references cited). The diffusion coefficient of oxygen atoms 
O

D  may be 

schematically expressed as

O OV

f m aH H H

R TD a e

? +? +?
?

?? ? ? ?? ?

?
  (Eq. 1.2.8) 

 

where a stands for pseudocubic cell parameter and the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient is 

determined by thermal effect of the formation of oxygen vacancies (?Hf), their migration (?Hm) and 

association (?Ha). Generally, the vacancy formation term dominates among the enthalpies, since this value 

involves breaking of B-O bonds and lowering the coordination of B-cation. The energy required for the 

breaking of B-O bond decreases in the sequence Ti&gt;Cr&gt;Mn&gt;Cu&gt;Fe&gt;Co [17, 146, 244]. The migration 

enthalpy of oxide ions is essentially governed by their facility to pass through the triangle A-B-A and is 

influenced by the nature (electronic structure, dimension etc.) of large A-site cations and lattice distortions; 

the minimum energy required to penetrate through the triangle is expected for cubic perovskites. The defect 

association-related phenomena are basically observed at high oxygen deficiency; examples include vacancy 

ordering, coulombic interaction between the defects, etc. [243, 245, 246]. 

Oxygen ionic transport in chromites is slow due to small oxygen vacancy concentration and the 

strong preferability of Cr atoms to octahedral environment with oxygen atoms [46, 149], while the presence 

of Co, Mn, Ga and other cations with a flexible coordination number in B-sublattice promotes the formation 

and transfer of oxygen vacancies [247-249].

The ionic conductivity of Cr-rich perovskites does not exceed 3×10-5 S/cm (Table 1.2.3); for 

comparison, the ionic conductivity of ferrite perovskites are ~4 orders of magnitude higher [114, 250]. The 

activation energies of the chemical diffusion or ionic conductivity in (Ln,A)CrO3-? are assessed as 100 - 160 

kJ/mol decreasing on B-site doping with Fe or Ni [198, 251, 252]. The diffusivity of oxygen vacancies in 

chromites is, however, assessed to be comparable to that in cobaltites and ferrites [251] which indicates that 



37 

 

the difference in the ionic conduction is primarily associated with much smaller oxygen deficiency and its 

low sensitivity towards variations in oxygen chemical potential. 

On the other hand, small oxygen deficiency in chromites allows to avoid the ordering phenomena 

typical for ferrites and cobaltites [114, 245, 246, 251]. Even Cr content as low as y = 0.1 in La0.33Sr0.67Fe1-

yCryO3-? make it possible to prevent the ordering of oxygen vacancies due to random distribution of Cr atoms 

in B-sublattice and suppressed formation of FeO4 tetrahedra [179]. Increasing concentration of oxygen 

vacancies via acceptor doping or by reducing p(O2) ensures a higher level of the ionic transport in chromites, 

as shown in Tables 1.2.3 - 1.2.4. This behavior is in accordance with a general observation that the ionic 

transport correlates with the expansion behaviour of perovskites [226, 253]. However, the increased oxygen 

diffusivity should be compromised by worse stability, enhanced expansion and lower electronic conductivity 

in reducing atmospheres.

The ionic diffusion in chromites was shown to be strongly contributed by grain boundary 

mechanism, especially under oxidizing conditions ([112, 254] and references cited). This factor, in particular, 

might induce an increase of the ionic conductivity proportionally to p(O2)
1/2 in high-p(O2) range [192, 198]. 

The surface exchange rates over chromites basically correlate with the ionic diffusion, assuming a 

major role of oxygen vacancies in the surface kinetics [252, 255]. However, the results are strongly 

susceptible to material processing and experimental conditions, while slow equilibration results in a strong 

scattering of the data. As observed in Table 1.2.4, the exchange coefficients exhibit lower activation energies 

compared with the diffusion coefficients and are less sensitive to p(O2) variations or acceptor doping. This 



38 

 

indicates that the role of the surface-related limitations is expected to be more pronounced at lower 

temperatures [252, 256], more reducing conditions [192] or higher content of dopants in A or B-sublattice 

[173, 252]. Irrespective of the trends observed, the low level of the ionic conductivity and slow surface 

exchange for LaCrO3-?-based materials does not allow to expect any substantial contribution of the bulk 

phase of the anode to the electrochemical process. This necessitates an optimization of the electrode 

morphology or addition of ion-conductive components into the anode. 

 

1.2.6. Electrode performance 

 

The electrochemical activity of chromite anodes strongly depends on the processing conditions, 

while comparison of experimental data is complicated by the lack of information on such important details as 

the composition of the solid electrolyte, fuel gas atmosphere, fractions of the components in composite 

electrode, etc. In most studies the perovskite anodes are covered with a layer of dispersed metallic particles 

sputtered or coated in form of paste, inks, etc. Althouth these particles are suggested to serve only as an 

electron-conductive component, without any effect on the activity, the contribution of metal-containing 

components can be neglected only when no surface spreading or metal penetration into the electrochemically 

active zone occurs. As shown by previous studies [261-263], Pt, Ag, Au and other noble metals possess non-

negligible catalytic activity which may be significantly higher compared to that of chromites. A wide 

utilization of noble metals in industrial scales is limited by high costs, while conventional current collectors 

made of stainless steels or LaCrO3-?-based ceramics have significantly higher bulk and contact resistance.  

Pure or A-site doped LaCrO3-? basically possess extremely low electrochemical activity (Table 

1.2.5); for instance, the polarization resistance of La0.7Cr0.32CrO3-? anode is reported to be ~86 Ohm×cm
2 at 

1123 K [201]. Therefore, chromites basically serve as chemically and mechanically stable electron 

conductive matrix in combination with ionic conductors (CeO2-, ZrO2-based oxides) or catalytically-active 

components (Ni, Pd, VOx). A large fraction of the stable perovskite phase diminishes risks of microstructural 

changes occurring on the additional components. Obviously, compared with conventional Ni-YSZ anodes, 

chromites are less susceptible to contamination with Cr species originating from the contact with interconnect 

materials. The activity can be to some extent improved by introducing A- or B-site dopants, especially those 

which form catalytically-active centres on the perovskite surface (Mn, Fe, etc.) or dispersed metallic particles 

(Ni, Ru). Extensive doping may induce a destabilization of the perovskite phase and enhance the chemical 

expansion [17, 146, 264, 265]. 

The electronic conductivity is one of critical factors determining the activity of perovskite-based 

anodes for hydrogen or hydrocarbon oxidation [10, 14, 265, 266]. As shown in Table 1.2.1, the conductivity 

is significantly reduced under anode conditions below 1 - 5 S/cm. Accounting for the porous microstructure 

of the electrode layer, the role of the current collector and addition of metallic or other electron conductive 

phases in most cases becomes more substantial than the intrinsic properties of the perovskite phase. On the 

other hand, appropriate A- or B-site doping may modify the transport and electrochemical properties.

One of the most widely studied chromite-based anodes is La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? and its 

derivatives [8, 10, 210]. Detailed description of the corresponding anodes and relationships between their 

functional properties and electrochemical performance will be presented in a separate section. One should 



42 

 

note that basically increasing the electronic transport in (Ln,A)(Cr,Mn)O3-? perovskite results in higher 

catalytic or electrocatalytic activity, emphasizing the role of the electronic conduction. Similar observations 

were made for (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-?-based perovskite anodes. The performance generally increases with Fe 

content, possibly due to better electronic conductivity and improved ionic transport. The polarization 

resistances for (Ln,A)(Cr,Mn)O3-? and (Ln,A)(Cr,Fe)O3-? are comparable, although the results in various 

studies are contradictory [9, 212]. 

Dissolution of Ni or Ru cations in the perovskite phase with their subsequent segregation on 

reduction allows to produce submicron dispersed metallic particles which possess a high catalytic activity. 

One of benefits of such an approach relates to partial or complete dissolution of the metals on oxidation [15, 

201] which improves the stability of the anodes on redox cycling. The precipitation of the metallic phases 

from the perovskite structure provides better electrochemical performance than preparation of mechanical 

mixtures with similar fraction of perovskite and metal [15]. In terms of microstructural stability, Ru-doping is 

more preferable compared with Ni due to higher melting point of Ru and, as a result, its suppressed 

vaporization and sintering [188, 267]. In La1-xSrxCr1-yRuyO3-?, the compromise between the optimum 

electrochemical activity and stability was achieved for x = 0.3 and y = 0.08 [15]; this composition is close to 

La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.95Ni0.05O3-? which exhibited the maximum CH4 conversion compared with other 

(La,Sr)(Cr,Ni)O3-? catalysts [265]. 

Apart from the electrochemical activity of chomite electrodes, one should take into account their 

compatibility with solid electrolytes. As the reactivity of electrode materials is governed by their stability, the 

chemical compatibility of chromites with commonly used solid electrolytes is generally better than that of 

cobaltites, ferrites and manganites. Interaction of Ca- or Sr-doped LaCrO3-? with solid electrolytes is strongly 

associated with cation demixing and formation of Ca-Cr-O or Sr-Cr-O secondary phases [141]. (La,Sr)CrO3-? 

are basically more compatible with YSZ electrolytes [134, 138, 275]. Reactivity of Ca-doped LaCrO3-? with 

YSZ originates from formation of CaO, Cam(CrO4)n phases [143], which are in most cases segregated at high 

temperatures during synthesis of the chromite perovskites, or from high diffusivity and solubility of Ca in the 

fluorite structure [154, 276]. Obviously, A-site deficiency suppresses the formation of Ln2Zr2O7-?, SrZrO3-? or 

CaZrO3-? phases [134]. The cation demixing may be promoted by exposure of the electrode to hydrocarbon- 

or CO/CO2-containing atmospheres or by polarization ([44, 259] and references cited). 

The presence of Sr2VO4 and Sr2CrO4 impurities in (La,Sr)(Cr,V)O3-? enhances the reactivity of the 

anode with YSZ at temperatures as low as 1273 K in both oxidizing and reducing atmospheres, which is 

inappropriate for SOFC applications [231]. The chemical compatibility of (La,Ca)(Cr,Ti)O3-? [155], 

La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? [8, 277], Pr0.7Ca0.3(Cr,Mn)O3-? [210] and (La,Sr)(Cr,Ru)O3-? [186] with YSZ 

electrolytes was observed at least up to 1573, 1573, 1473 and 1373 K. 

The interaction with LaGaO3-?-based electrolytes is primarily associated with a high tolerance of 

gallate phases towards B-site substitution and a gradient of La chemical potential between the components 

inducing La diffusion and formation of interfacial LaSrGaO4 and LaSrGa3O7 phases with low ionic 

conductivity [278-280]. With respect to anode materials, the presence of Fe, Ni, Co-containing compositions 

in direct contact with LSGM is undesirable [9, 10, 278]. For example, the onset of interaction between 

(La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-? and LSGM is located at relatively low temperatures (1073 - 1173 K) resulting in cation 



43 

 

exchange [278] or formation of LaSrGa3O7 [264]. The interaction of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Al0.5O3-? with LSGM 

starts at 1473 K producing SrCrO4, LaCrO3-? and LaGaO3-?-based phases and causing the electrode 

delamination [9]. La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? reacts with LSGM at temperatures as high as 1623 - 1673 K with 

formation of LaSrGaO4 and LaSrGa3O7 [279, 280]. Similar to LSGM, the compatibility of CeO2-?-based 

electrolytes is determined by solubility and mobility of cations in the fluorite structure. La0.7Ca0.3CrO3-? was 

reported to be compatible with CGO [268] at 1473 K. No chemical interaction between (La,Sr)CrO3-? and 

CGO was reported up to 1873 K, however, the presence of CaCrO4, SrCrO4 or Cr2O3 impurities causes a 

strong cation interdiffusion and formation of new phases [281]. No interaction of Ce0.9Sr0.1Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-? with 

Ce0.8Sm0.2O2-? was found at 1173 K in N2 [223]. 

Apart from the interaction with electrolyte material, the long-term performance of chromite-based 

anodes is strongly affected by the presence of components with low chemical and/or microstructural stability 

(metallic phase, VOx, doped CeO2-?, etc.) which may undergo a loss of catalytic activity, vaporization, 

changes in porous anode microstructure due to sintering and lowering the active electrode surface area, 

blocking the pores, strong volume changes, cracking of the electrode layer or its delamination from the 

electrolyte. As an example, stable operation was found in H2 and CH4 for La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.95Ru0.05O3-? - YSZ 

[186], while increasing Ru fraction results in a coalescence of the metallic particle and reduces the activity 

[15, 188]. While the performance of Ce0.9Sr0.1Cr0.5V0.5O3-? anode was stable in H2S - CH4 for more than 15 

hours at 1123 K, the composite Ce0.9Sr0.1Cr0.5V0.5O3-? - YSZ - Ni showed a degradation rate of 10% per 15 

hours at the same conditions [162]. Comparable degradation rate was detected for La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.98V0.02O3-? - 

CGO - Ni (48 - 48 - 4 wt. %) in hydrocarbon atmosphere at 873 - 1023 K [274], while no drop of the 

performance was observed for anode La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.97V0.03O3-? - CGO (75 - 25 wt.%) impregnated with Ru (1 

mg/cm2) in wet CH4 [282]. This observation confirms that the stability is mainly governed by the nature and 

amount of metallic or other microstructurally-unstable phases rather than by the perovskite degradation. B-

site doping of chromites with transition metals may also promote the degradation processes; in particular, the 

initial high performance of Mn-, Fe-, Ni- and Ru-doped chromite anodes is in most cases followed by a rapid 

decay [186, 212, 283].   

Other factors which influence the stable operation of chromite electrodes are thermal or redox 

cycling; the latter may be induced by changing the gas environment or by oscillating polarization. As the 

elementary electrode steps are affected by p(O2) by various manner, the final result is not obvious. For 

example, the polarization resistance of La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.97V0.03O3-? anode decreased after reoxidation in air [201], 

while La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.98V0.02O3-? - CGO - Ni showed a drop of activity on oxidation in air, followed by a rapid 

recovery after switching back to H2 or C3H8. This composite anode could withstand up to 11 redox cycles of 

1 hour [274]. In [283], the performance of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? - YSZ composite anode was deteriorated 

on cycling in wet H2 - reformate - wet O2 at 1173 K by 15% per 4 cycles; however, the initial performance 

drop was followed by subsequent stabilization. The performance of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? - CGO (33 - 67 

wt. %) showed a slight (3%) decrease after cycling in wet CH4 at 1123 K for 50 hours under currents 

oscillating in the range 200 - 400 mA/cm2 [284].

1.2.7. Cr-poisoning phenomena in SOFCs 

 

This section is devoted to the phenomena of contamination of SOFC components with Cr species. 

The poisoning is mainly associated with application of Cr-containing interconnect materials. The primary 

function of interconnects is to ensure mechanical and electrical contact between the cathode/anode of 

adjacent cells and to provide the separation of the fuel gas from the oxidant. This imposes stringent 

requirements on the interconnect material such as chemical stability towards oxidative and reductive 

atmospheres, impremeability of gases, high electronic and negligible ionic conduction, chemical and 

mechanical compatibility with SOFC components, low costs [3, 6]. 

Currently, 2 types of interconnect materials are employed. One group is represented by metallic 

alloys, mainly Fe-based materials due to their low costs and relatively high tolerance towards oxidation due 

to formation of Cr2O3-based scales on the surface. The oxidation resistance as well as mechanical properties 

may be tuned by addition of Al, Cr, Si, Mo and other elements. The percentage of Cr in metal-based 

interconnect materials is basically higher than 10 wt.%, although this amount should not overcome 26 wt.% 

to avoid formation of brittle phases [285]. 

Ceramics with acceptable electronic conductivity compose the other group of interconnect materials. 

As shown in previous sections, the characteristics of LnCrO3-?-based materials satisfy the most requirements; 

in particular, the negligible ionic conductivity of chromites is more advantageous for interconnects rather 

than for anodes. However, poor thermal conductivity, possibility of cracking and insufficient density restricts 

the application of chromites as interconnects. Generally, the choice of interconnect material is determined by 

the range of working and fabrication temperatures. While metal-based interconnects suffer from oxidation at 

high temperatures, chromite-based ceramic materials are stable in a wide p(O2) range ([46, 134] and 

references therein). On the other hand, the conductivity of chromites is substantially activated by temperature 

[112, 160, 187]; consequently, this group of interconnects is mainly considered for high-temperature 

utilization. Decreasing the temperature reduces the risk of oxidation of metallic interconnects which makes 

these more appropriate for intermediate- and low-temperature electrochemical cells. 

Irrespective of the type of the interconnect, most materials contain substantial amount of Cr which 

can cause contamination of other SOFC components and subsequent degradation of the performance. Even if 

Cr content in interconnect is moderate and its reactivity is suppressed by binding to a stable composition or 

application of protective layers, Cr penetration into electrode compartments may proceed via flowing in gas 

phase from upstream cell components like manifolds, heat exchangers, etc. 

As reported above, for Cr-containing alloys, protective Cr2O3-based scales are formed on the 

surface. The formation was observed under both cathode and anode conditions, although in the latter case, 

the growth rate was much lower. In numerous cells, the Cr2O3 layer is the most resistant component, while its 

continuous enlargement results in a progressive increase of Ohmic losses [286]. In contact of Cr2O3 with Co, 

Fe, Mn, Ni-containing electrodes, the formation of spinel phases (Cr,M)3O4 was observed [241, 285, 287]. 

These phases are more preferable in comparison with Cr2O3 in terms of conductivity, especially Co-rich ones 

[241], although the resistance is still too high for achieving reasonable power densities of the cell, while the 

depletion of the electrode with a transition metal may reduce the catalytic activity. 



45 

 

One of the most detrimental phenomena in terms of the cell degradation is Cr penetration into the 

electrode layers. In literature, two ways of Cr incorporation are discussed: surface diffusion and deposition 

from the gas phase. The diffusion was shown to be strongly promoted by the presence of Co-, Mg-, Mn-, Sr-, 

and Au-containing species [285, 288, 289]. Among cathode materials, the most susceptible ones to diffusion-

related Cr contamination are manganite- and cobaltite-based compositions [285]. 

Another mechanism Cr poisoning processes involves chromia vaporization and subsequent 

deposition on the surface of cell components [82-85]. The latter process is especially pronounced at elevated 

temperatures due to enhanced activation energy [285]. As shown in Figs. 1.2.8 - 1.2.9, the most abundant Cr-

containing species in gas phase are CrO3, CrO2(OH)2 and CrO2(OH). Occasional penetration of water vapors 

into the cathode compartment results in an enrichment of the atmosphere with Cr oxihydroxides. The 

presence of Cr-containing volatile species may subsequently result in their reduction and deposition on the 

cathode or electrolyte surface or at the interface cathode-electrolyte. 

The deposition of Cr-containing compounds from the gas phase may be catalyzed electrochemically 

[85, 290], by reduction in oxygen-depleted atmosphere near the triple phase boundary (TPB) [83, 290] or 

chemically; in the latter case, the deposition is ensured by the presence of catalytically-active species (i.e. 

Mn2+, Co2+ or SrO) [84, 285, 291]. The latter mechanism is confirmed by the fact that in manganite- and 

cobaltite-based cathodes, the deposition proceeds in the entire electrode layer. 

Basically, Cr is deposited in form of spinel phase; examples of the chemical reduction processes are 

shown in Eqs. (1.2.9) - (1.2.12):

Deposition of Cr2O3 causes lowering the pressure of Cr-containing phases which favors subsequent 

vaporization of Cr from interconnect and resultant depletion with chromium. Accumulation of the spinel 

phase results in gradually increasing concentration polarization, while the volume changes may cause a 

propagation of cracks [83, 290]. 

The electrochemically-assisted deposition process is supported by observations that cathodic 

polarization promotes the degradation, while the formation of spinel phase takes place predominantly near 

cathode-electrolyte interface [82, 83, 290]. The electrochemical reactions can be briefly formulated as:

The deposition of Cr2O3 and subsequent interaction with cathode and electrolyte materials (Eqs. 

(1.2.11), (1.2.12)) result in blocking TPB by the products, while the participation of electrons in the 

secondary processes reduces the efficiency of the cell. Estimations carried out in [82] showed that under 

working conditions, the deposition rate of chromia at the cathode exceeds 8×10-9 g/m2×s, i.e., considering the 

total cathode surface, this value corresponds to formation of a Cr monolayer in 2.4 s. 

Similar to the surface diffusion, the maximum Cr deposition from the gaseous phase was observed 

on (La,Sr)MnO3-? and (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-?-based cathodes [285, 291, 292]. A strong tendency of Fe-

containing cathodes, i.e La0.8Sr0.2Co0.75Fe0.25O3-?, LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3-?, La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-? to degradation in contact 

with Cr-containing materials was reported by Montero et al. [293], although in other publications, 

La(Ni,Fe)O3-? compositions were found to be tolerant towards Cr contamination [285, 294]. At high content 

of alkali-earth cations in cathode material, the phases CaCrO4, SrCrO4 or BaCrO4 can be formed at the 

interface cathode-interconnect or on the cathode surface [44, 293] with resultant deterioration of transport 

and mechanical properties or loss of the electrochemical activity. 

The anode conditions are generally not favorable for Cr vaporization and a substantial enrichment of 

the gas atmosphere with Cr species may be only as a result of an occasional penetration from other 

compartments of the cell or by an accidental oxidation of Cr-containing anodes. Moreover, the 

electrochemical oxidation at the anode side should suppress the processes Eqs. (1.2.13) - (1.2.15). Possibly, 

one should take precautions with Cr chemical deposition on the anode surface, in particular when operating 

with Mn-containing since the presence of Mn2+ or MnO species and low p(O2) may induce the reduction of 

gaseous Cr6+-containing species and their deposition. However, such phenomena have not been found in 



47 

 

literature. More concerns are related with Cr, Fe and Ni interdiffusion between the anode and interconnect 

materials resulting in formation of insulating Cr2O3, (Cr,Ni)3O4 and FeO phases [288, 293, 295, 296]. One 

should notice that Cr2O3-based phases possess a worse conductivity under low-p(O2) conditions [115, 288] 

which may be caused by H2 dissolution in chromia [297]. Similar to cathode degradation process, the 

formation of the secondary phases may result in blocking pores in the top layers of the electrode, and risks of 

mechanical failure due to chemical expansion [296]. 

Among solid electrolytes, gallate-based perovskites are strongly susceptible to deposition of 

chromia onto the surface from the vapour phase or to the surface diffusion in contact with an interconnect 

[285]. A slight bulk diffusion of Cr and Mn from (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-?-based electrodes into LSGM was 

reported [10, 218]. The poisoning effect of Cr on fluorite-type electrolytes is less studied. A slight diffusion 

of Cr along the surface of YSZ and CGO was observed, without any traces of Cr2O3 precipitated from the gas 

phase [285], in contrast to the mechanism expressed by Eq. (1.2.12) [82]. The contamination of the 

electrolytes is attributed to catalyzing effect of Y2O3 and Gd2O3 additions, while the parent phases ZrO2 and 

CeO2 are insusceptible towards Cr penetration [285]. 

In order to prevent the problems associated with the contamination of SOFC components with Cr, 

several modifications were undertaken, with the primary focus on inhibition of volatilization of Cr-containing 

compounds or suppressing the diffusion. In particular, the vaporization may be suppressed by utilization of 

ceramic chromite-based interconnects. As shown in Fig. 1.2.8, the partial pressure of CrO3, CrO2(OH)2 and 

CrO2(OH) over chromite perovskites are 3 - 4 orders lower than over Cr2O3, although their behavior with 

changes of p(H2O) or temperature is similar. A positive effect may be achieved by reducing the operation 

temperature. One should note that most studies on Cr vaporization or diffusion phenomena from metallic 

interconnects have been carried out at the temperatures above 973 K, while the Cr-containing alloys are 

designed for operation in the intermediate- or low-temperature ranges. 

In LnCrO3-?-based interconnects, the vaporization of chromia during preparation or operation 

procedure was shown to be suppressed by creation of Cr deficiency in the perovskite [135], appropriate 

doping into A- or B-sublattice [153, 189, 209] or introduction of components ensuring better densification 

[160]. Thin layers of LaCrO3-?- or LaMnO3-?-based perovskites ([288, 290] and references cited), spinel-type 

(Mn,Co,Cr)3O4  [293, 296] or CeO2-based materials [296] were shown to prevent the interdiffusion between 

the corresponding materials or to suppress chromia vaporization from the surface, although their application 

may result in increasing Ohmic drops of the cell. 

Finally, one should notice that Cr is not the unique component which causes the cell degradation. 

Fe-diffusion from interconnects is stronger than that of Cr, and may also cause the formation of insulating 

phases [288, 296]. Numerous interconnect alloys contain Mo-, Si- and other elements capable to generate 

volatile compounds with more detrimental effect on the properties of SOFC components.  

  

1.3. Manganite-based perovskites and their limitations 

 

Manganite-based perovskites have been widely studied as cathode materials due to their high 

electronic conductivity, moderate thermal expansion, acceptable catalytic activity and suppressed (in 



48 

 

comparison with other cathodes) interaction with SOFC components. Reduction of manganites, although 

being attractive in terms of an improvement of the ionic transport and mofification of the electrochemical 

properties, results in destabilization of the perovskite phase. On the other hand, the number of studies 

devoted to assessment of manganites as anode materials or evaluation of their low-p(O2) characteristics has 

been growing in recent years. The present section is focused on comparison of manganite perovskite as 

potential anode materials, with a primary attention on their tolerance towards reducing atmospheres. 

 

1.3.1. Thermodynamic stability 

 

The behavior of manganite perovskites in terms of the defect equilibrium is generally similar to that 

of chromite analogues, and most equations described in the corresponding section may be applied for 

LnMnO3±?-based compositions. However, manganite perovskites exhibits some peculiarities: 

1. High flexibility of Mn cations in terms of the oxygen coordination and the capability to adopt the 

oxidation state +2 significantly increase the oxygen nonstoichiometry of manganites in comparison with 

chromite analogues. The stability of Mn in +2, +3 and +4 oxidation states makes it necessary to account for 

the process of Mn3+ disproportionation in modeling the defect equilibrium. 

2. Manganites are capable to accommodate excessive oxygen in the crystal lattice. Since the 

perovskite structure is not tolerant to incorporation of oxygen into the interstitial sites, the overstoichiometry 

is accompanied by generation of cation vacancies [298-300]. Although at low p(O2) the cation vacancies 

disappear, the processes associated with variations of oxygen content may be characterized by phase 

transitions and dimensional changes which should be taken into account when fabricating the anode layers. 

Defect models explaining the behavior of manganite perovskites have been elaborated in numerous 

studies [234, 244, 300-305]. In [303], a model which included the coexistence of 9 type of lattice defects in 

La, Mn and O sublattices in p(O2) range of 10
-30 - 10-5 atm was proposed using numerical methods of 

calculation. Selected approaches involved consideration of the interactions between the defect species, 

formation of defect clusters, etc [224, 304, 305]. In the model elaborated by Mizusaki et al. [300] for Sr-

substituted manganites, the energy levels of the states 
Mn

Mn? , 
Mn

Mn
× , 

Mn
Mn

i  are assumed to be close, and the 

thermodynamic parameters are governed essentially by the average Mn oxidation state. However, this 

approach is valid only in a limited range of Mn oxidation states, where the concentrations of Mn species may 

be considered comparable. Moreover, the model does not describe adequately the experimental data. 

Regardless the approach describing the behavior of manganite perovskites, the stability of Mn in 2+ 

state significantly enhances the maximum oxygen deficiency in comparison with chromites. While La1-

xAxCrO3-? shows the high- and low-p(O2) saturations at ? = 0 and x/2, for manganite-based analogues these 

regions are expected to transform into a plateau-like dependencies, followed by subsequent variations of 

oxygen content [303]. The width of the low-p(O2) plateau is determined by the equilibrium constant of Mn
3+ 

disproportionation. In practice, no plateau-like behavior at ? = x/2 has been observed, as shown in Fig. 1.3.1. 

For most compositions, this phenomenon is associated with low tolerance of the perovskite structure towards 

extensive oxygen losses, preventing formation of large quantities of Mn2+ species.

Fig. 1.3.1. Isothermal dependencies of oxygen content in manganites vs. p(O2) 

 

Approximate phase boundaries of selected manganite-based perovskites are shown in Fig. 1.3.2 and 

Table 1.3.1. Consistently with the defect model, alkali earth dopants enlarge the oxygen losses and reduce the 

stability of manganites. Depending on the doping level, decomposition of (La,Sr)MnO3±? leads to formation 

of MnO, SrMnO3-? and (La,Sr)2MnO4±? phases, with La:Sr ratio similar or somewhat lower (for La-rich 

compositions) than that in the parent perovskite [309, 310]. On increasing Sr content, an enrichment of the 

surface with Sr was observed, promoted by low p(O2) [311-313]. The stability of LnMnO3±? decreases with 

lowering the radius of A-cation [45], as shown in Fig. 1.3.2. 

While replacement of chromium in LnCrO3±?-based perovskites promotes oxygen losses even when 

the doping cations are stable towards reduction, the effect of B-site cation substitution in manganites is less 

obvious. Introduction of easily reducible Fe, Co, Ni, Cu enhances the oxygen losses and deteriorates the 

stability of the manganites towards reduction; selected examples of variations of the oxygen content in Co-

doped manganites are presented in Fig. 1.3.1. [226, 307, 308]. 

Introduction of 3-fold charged cations, like Sc, has no obvious effect on the oxygen 

nonstoichiometry [306], although more results for B-site substituted manganites are required for more certain 

conclusions. Doping of PrMnO3±?-based compositions with In diminishes oxygen losses on reduction at 973 

K compared with In-free analogue, while at 1273 K the trend is opposite [314]. This might indicate a strong 

effect of the substituents on the enthalpy of vacancy formation, kinetic factors or individual peculiarities of 

doping cations with respect to oxygen environment.

Fig. 1.3.2. Stability limits of manganite perovskites 
 
 
Introduction of 3+, 4+, 5+-charged cations generally results in thermodynamic or kinetic 

stabilization of manganites at low p(O2), as shown in Table 1.3.1. Single-phase LnMnO3±?-based perovskites 

were detected at p(O2) as low as 10
-20 atm at 973 - 1173 K, which is quite acceptable for the anode 

applications. One may observe contradictions between the results presented in Table 1.3.1. In particular, 

La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? is reported to decompose at 10
-20 atm at 1173 K [191], although in [8] the stability 

of the perovskite phase was observed down to at least 10-21 atm. While Pr0.7Ca0.3Cr0.4Mn0.6O3-? was found to 

be stable in dry 5% H2 - Ar [210], a similar composition doped with 25% of Sr and 50% of Mn showed 

insufficient stability in more mild reducing atmospheres [8], although the lower content of the alkali earth 

cation and Mn are expected to improve the tolerance towards reduction. La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.8Sc0.2O3-? is stable at 

1123 K in H2 - Ar mixture with p(O2) = 10
-21 atm and in wet CH4 (p(O2) = 10

-23 atm) [315]. On the other 

hand, in CO - CO2 atmosphere with p(O2) = 10
-18 atm at 1123 K the same material shows the formation of 

secondary phases [316]. In the latter case, the presence of CO or CO2 might promote the decomposition of 

the perovskite while poor conversion of CH4 over the perovskite might ensure insufficiently reductive 

atmosphere, thus maintaining its stability. 

In the high p(O2) range, manganites with moderate quantities of acceptor-type substituents exhibit a 

so-called oxygen overstoichiometry (LnMnO3+?), presumably due to preferability of formation of the 

vacancies in A- or B-sublattice is arguable. Small size of B-cations favors their incorporation into A-

sublattice, which, on the other hand, is hindered by strong bonds B-O. In literature, the equivalent 

concentration of A- and B-site vacancies as well as their dominant formation in one of the sublattices can be 

found [298-300, 321, 322]; currently, most approaches consider the preferability of the formation of A-site 

vacancies [298-300]. The cation exchange between A and B-perovskite positions enlarges the range of 

acceptable Ln:Mn ratios; for LaMnO3±?, formation of single phase was observed for Mn/(La+Mn) of 0.45 - 

0.52 at 1123 K, the region expanding on cooling [302].

Mizusaki et al. [300] detected a tendency towards saturation of the oxygen overstoichiometry, close 

to 3+??3.2 for LaMnO3+? and decreasing with Sr content. The limit is especially pronounced at temperatures 

lower than 700 - 800 K and Sr-substituted manganites. The maximum amount of the cation vacancies is 

evaluated to be 1/9 which corresponds to LaMnO3.19 [300]. Alkali-earth doping results in a linear decrease of 

the maximum oxygen content which the perovskite structure may accommodate; at doping level higher than 

~30%, the oxygen excess disappears. These results as well as the corresponding defect model should be 



52 

 

considered with precautions due to hindered mobility of the cation vacancies, especially at lowered 

temperatures, retarding the equilibration kinetics. This causes a wide scattering between the experimental 

data; in particular, under p(O2) = 200 bar at low temperatures formation of LaMnO3.29 was reported [322]. 

Irrespective to the oxygen excess, the transport behavior of manganites is essentially unaffected by 

p(O2) variations in oxidative atmospheres [301, 323]. According to [300, 323], an electron from a sublevel 

belonging to an oxygen atom is suggested to hop into a t2g level of Mn and the hole remaining in the oxygen 

sublevel is excluded from the transfer mechanism. Another possibility is associated with the fact that the 

charge transport proceeds along Mn-O-Mn paths and formation of cation vacancies in B-sublattice 

compensates the increase in hole concentration [322]. 

In terms of potential anode applications, consideration of the functional properties will be focused 

primarily on the behavior at low p(O2). Therefore, the choice of the manganite perovskites will be limited by 

the materials stable under reducing conditions. 

 

 

1.3.2. Mixed electronic-ionic conductivity in reducing atmospheres and thermomechanical 

properties 
 

In the present section, available data on the behavior of manganites under low oxygen pressures will 

be overviewed, with a brief discussion of selected properties of the materials under atmospheric p(O2) and 

their behavior on reduction. More detailed characterization of Mn-rich perovskites under atmospheric 

conditions can be found elsewhere ([4, 131, 266, 323, 324] and references cited]). 

Similar to LnCrO3-? perovskites, manganites are electronic conductors with a minor contribution of 

the oxygen ionic transport. The conductivity behavior of manganites with a moderate (&lt;50%) content of 

acceptor-type dopants in A-sublattice shows trends typical for p-type electronic conductors. According to the 

transport model proposed by Mizusaki et al. [300, 323], the electron transfer is promoted by participation of a 

vacant eg sublevel in 3d-level of 
Mn

Mn
i . The conductivity of (La,Sr)MnO3±? in air increases with acceptor 

content, achieving the maximum for doping level of 20 - 50 mol.% [266, 323, 324]. As discussed in the 

previous section, no effect of excessive oxygen content on the transport properties has been found. Formation 

of Mn2+ species does not result in a noticeable contribution of n-type conductivity, and the total conductivity 

is substantially suppressed under reducing conditions, as shown in Figs. 1.3.3 - 1.3.5. Due to substantial 

oxygen losses and worse stability of manganites doped with alkali-earth cations, the effect of the acceptor 

content under low p(O2) conditions is not obvious; examples are shown in Table 1.3.2 and Fig. 1.3.3. 

In terms of the total conductivity, manganites seem more preferable in comparison with chromite 

analogues; the values of the electronic transport of (La,Sr)MnO3±? may be as high as 50 - 100 S/cm at p(O2) = 

10-18 -10-15 atm [323]. One should note that the p(O2) range indicated is located close to the decomposition 

boundary and the high level of the electronic transport may be attributed to kinetic stabilization of the 

perovskite phase or a contribution of the decomposition products into the overall conductivity. Therefore, 

long-term tests are required to assess the stability of the transport characteristics of manganites.

More reliable seem the data for manganites stabilized with dopants in B-sublattice. As a general 

rule, increasing the content of stabilizing dopant (Cr, Ti, Sc, Ga, Al etc.) reduces the conductivity in both 

oxidizing and reducing conditions [16, 315, 319], attributable to a decrease of the concentration of sites 

available for the electronic transport. No contribution of n-type conductivity has been found for Ti- or Nb-

doped manganites [16, 19, 20] which indicates that a preliminary reduction step might be required to activate 

electron charge carriers, similar to other Ti- or Nb-rich compositions [73, 97, 98, 105].

Fig 1.3.5. Isothermal dependencies of the total conductivity of selected manganites vs p(O2) at 973 - 1223 K 
 
 

In case of decomposition of stabilized manganites, formation of phases enriched with Al, Ga, Ti, 

etc. with high resistivity is expected which may be more detrimental in terms of the transport properties and 

catalytic activity than formation of RP-manganites or MnO. As shown in p(O2) dependencies of the 

conductivity (Figs. 1.3.3 -1.3.5), larger values of the electronic transport were exhibited by (La,Sr)MnO3±? or 

manganites substituted by Fe, Co or Ni cations, despite their insufficient stability. Therefore, one should find 

the compromise between the transport properties, stability and other characteristics. 

Another limitation of manganite-based anodes, especially those stabilized by cations in B-sublattice 

relates to their enhanced activation energy at low p(O2) which amounts to 30 - 50 kJ/mol for perovskites with 

~50 mol.% of Mn and increases with the concentration of B-site dopant [16, 20, 319, 325]. This necessitates 

application of high temperatures to achieve reasonable anode performances, with a risk to promote the 

interaction between the cell components. 

Dilatometric curves of LaMnO3±? in air exhibit a change in slope on heating at 550 - 600 K, possibly 

associated with the onset of oxygen losses and resultant transformation of the low-temperature orthorhombic 

structure into the rhombohedral symmetry [131, 299]. Doping with alkali-earth cation increases the TEC 

(Table 1.3.3), more pronounced for the dopants with larger ionic radii. Detailed information on the effect of 

B-site dopant on the thermomechanical properties can be found elsewhere ([131, 238, 266, 324, 326] and 

references cited). Nevertheless, the thermal expansion of manganite perovskites is quite appropriate for 

fabrication of the electrode layers, except for CaMnO3-?- and SrMnO3-?-based compositions.

More concerns are related with large expansivity of manganite perovskites in reducing atmospheres. 

As shown in Table 1.3.4, the chemically-induced elongation of most manganites is as high as 0.4 - 0.7%, 

which significantly exceeds that of chromite analogues, presumably due to increased oxygen losses and 

generation of large Mn2+ species. While the chemical strains in LaCrO3-? are essentially negligible within the 

uncertainties of the experimental technique, LaMnO3±? on reduction exhibits the expansion up to 0.1%. 

Consistently, among the perovskites with substantial amount of Mn, the lowest strains were found for 

(La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-?-based compositions. In the oxygen-deficient region, the thermomechanical behavior of 

manganites is governed by relationships similar to those described in the corresponding section for chromites 

[234, 236]. In some cases, redox cycling of manganites is accompanied by irreversible microstructural 

changes, resulting in mechanical degradation [16, 317]. 

The expansion behavior of manganites in oxygen-excessive region is less obvious. Appart from the 

common factors responsible for the thermomechanical properties of most perovskites, such as variations of 

the oxidation state of Mn species, generation of cation vacancies leading to an enhancement of the number of 

unit cells [331-334], the expansivity of manganites may be influenced by slow equilibration, ceramics 

densification, cracking, etc [16, 238, 335]. 

The dimensional instability in the high p(O2) range makes it necessary to suppress the oxygen 

overstoichiometry. Even if the reduction of oxygen-rich manganites causes a shrinkage which might 

compensate the subsequent low-p(O2) expansion, exposure of the material to periodic volume changes may 

be detrimental for the mechanical integrity of the anode layers. While chromites show nearly linear 

relationship between the amount of alkali-earth dopant and chemical strains on reduction, for manganite 

perovskites the presence of moderate quantities of acceptor dopants is beneficial which, however, should be 

compromised by stability and dimensional behavior at low p(O2).

Oxygen ionic conductivity in manganites in oxygen deficient region shows the features typical for 

most perovskites. The ionic transfer proceeds via vacancy mechanism, and the diffusivity may to some extent 

be enhanced by formation of oxygen vacancies generated by introduction of alkali-earth cations or reduction, 

as shown in Tables 1.3.5 - 1.3.6. However, under low p(O2) conditions, the effect of acceptor content is weak 

[305]. Generation of A-site deficiency basically has no substantial effect on the ionic transport which may 

indicate the defect association or that the charge compensation in the latter case is realized by Mn oxidation 

rather than by the formation of oxygen vacancies [336].  

A correlation between the chemical diffusion and surface exchange kinetics for (La,Sr)(Mn,Co)O3-? 

perovskites was found [337, 338] indicating that the oxygen exchange processes are governed by the 

availability of the oxygen vacancies on the surface. Although the oxygen ionic transport in manganites is 

higher in comparison with chromite analogues, this level is still insufficient to expect a substantial promotion 

of the electrochemical processes; for example, the ionic conductivity of La1-xSrxMnO3-? (x = 0.05 - 0.2) is as 

low as 10-7-10-6 S/cm at 1273 K under oxidizing conditions. Similar to chromites, the diffusion may be 

contributed by oxygen transport along the grain boundaries [336, 339]. 

The values of the activation energy of the chemical or oxygen vacancy diffusion in manganites are 

generally larger (200 - 300 kJ/mol) in comparison with those for chromite analogues. Such a difference is 

attributed to high enthalpies of the vacancy formation in manganites [338], variations in Mn-O bond strength 

owing to variations in Mn oxidation state [336], or defect interactions [305, 327, 336, 340]. The dominant 

contribution of the enthalpy of oxygen vacancy formation into the activation energy was confirmed by 

increasing activation energy with Sr-doping [336, 338], while facilitation of oxygen release by introduction 

of Fe or Co results in lower activation energies [338, 339].

The ionic transport characteristics may be improved by introduction of cations with stable oxidation 

state (basically +3) in B-sublattice [320, 328]; in combination with better chemical stability, this route seems 

promising for anode applications, although one should account for the decrease in the electronic conductivity. 

The presence of reducible substituents in B-sublattice is less preferable, since apart from the worse stability 

towards reduction, the defect interactions retard the ionic mobility and surface exchange [131, 338]. 

Under oxidizing conditions, the behavior Ln- and Mn-enriched perovskites is strongly influenced by 

the presence of cation vacancies. As discusses above, the equilibration in this domain of conditions is slow, 

and the experimental results are affected by material preparation route and experimental procedure. 

Therefore, direct comparison of the experimental data under high p(O2) is complicated (Table 1.3.5).  

 

1.3.3. Electrochemical behavior in reducing atmospheres 
 
Comparing the polarization resistance and power densities of electrochemical cells based on 

manganite anodes (Fig. 1.3.6 and Table 1.3.5) with those for chromite analogues, one may notice a somewhat 

superior activity of the manganites. In particular, while non-modified La0.85Sr0.15CrO3-? anode showed 



59 

 

extremely low electrode performance [17], a satisfactory anode activity was detected for La1-xSrxMnO3-? 

anodes, increasing with Sr content up to 630 mW/cm2 for x = 0.5 at 1273 K in 3% H2O - H2 [95]. However, 

no compositional or microstructural modifications or anode current collectors were indicated in both cases 

which complicates the comparison. Higher Sr content in manganites allows to reduce Ohmic and polarization 

losses; both contributions to the overall resistance show a correlation with the electronic conductivity of the 

perovskites in oxidative atmospheres indicating that the phase decomposition of (La,Sr)MnO3-? expected 

under anode conditions might be hindered by kinetic reasons. The electrodes are tolerant towards one redox 

cycle, although more severe stability tests are necessary, especially accounting for the large chemical 

expansivity of the materials. 

For Al, Sc, Ti, Ga-doped manganites, the performance is basically better for Mn-enriched electrode 

compositions. The preferability of Mn-rich perovskites as well as higher activity of manganites over other 

perovskite anodes such as chromites and titanates may be associated with the following factors: 

1. High Mn content ensures enhanced electronic conductivity (compare the data in Table 1.3.2 and 

Table 1.2.1) and promotes higher oxygen diffusion under reducing conditions, although the presence of 

moderate amounts of 3-valent cations in B-sublattice is also favorable for the ionic transport [320, 328]. The 

sufficient level of the electronic and ionic conductivity provides a reasonable rate of supply/removal of 

electrons, oxygen vacancies to/from the electrochemically active sites on the electrode surface or at the TPB. 

2. Mn cations are stable in multiple oxidation states (+2, +3 and +4), as discussed in Chapter 1.3.1 

[234, 300, 324], and may adopt various oxygen coordination (tetrahedral, square pyramidal, octahedral) 

(examples may be found in [249, 344-346] and references cited). This favors stabilization of numerous forms 

of Mn-containing species participating in the electrochemical processes and allows to maintain catalytically-

active species on the anode surface. By far, the information on the role of Mn species in oxidation processes 

is scarce [258, 279, 347, 348] which does not allow to elucidate a certain mechanism of the electrochemical 

processes over manganite anodes.

3. High solubility of Mn in zirconia provides good adhesion of the manganite electrode layers to 

ZrO2-based electrolytes which may contribute the performance due to microstructural factors, especially in 

YSZ-containing composites [306, 349-352]. 

In accordance with the factors listed above, promising power densities were produced for 

La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.9Sc0.1O3-? perovskite anode activated by CeO2, Ag, Pd and impregnated into YSZ scaffolds 

(~700 mW/cm2 in 3% H2O - H2 and 450 mW/cm
2 in 3% H2O - CH4 at 1073 K) [306]. The power density as 

high as ~360 mW/cm2 at 1129 K in wet H2 was yielded for La0.4Sr0.6Mn0.6Ti0.4O3-? - YSZ (50 - 50 wt.%) with 

YSZ electrolyte of 200 µ m thickness. This value of the power density is not a limit for this cell, since it 

corresponds to the voltage of 0.7 V. The result is, however, interfered by the presence of Au paste. The anode 

polarization resistance under given conditions is ~0.3 Ohm×cm2 [16]; a close value was obtained for A-

deficient (La0.8Sr0.2)0.94Mn0.5Al0.5O3-? - YSZ (65 - 35 vol.%) composite anode covered with Au paste [317]. 

The level of the polarization resistances observable for manganite anodes studied in the present section is 

somewhat higher in comparison with Cr-substituted manganites. One should note that the latter group of 

compositions has been studied more extensively and more compositional and microstructural improvements 

have been elaborated. 

The insufficient stability of manganites, large chemical expansion and strong reactivity with 

electrolytes make the problem of long-term performance critical for their practical applications as anodes. 

While the anode La0.4Sr0.6Mn0.6Ti0.4O3-? - YSZ showed only a slight initial increase in polarization and Ohmic 

resistance in H2 at 1068 K (~10% per 200 hours) [16], the degradation rate for La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.5Al0.5O3-? - YSZ 

under similar condition was more than 100% in terms of the overvoltage for 100 hours of testing. While the 

Ohmic drop might be recovered by redox cycling, the increase in the polarization resistance was irreversible, 

apparently due to mechanical degradation [317]. 

La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.8Sc0.2O3-? exhibited a rapid degradation of performance (70%/3 hours) in CO under 

open circuit voltage (OCV) while oxidation of the anode induced by anodic polarization or addition of CO2 

into the fuel allowed to suppress the drop of the power density indicating that the material is close to the 

phase boundary under anode environments [316]. However, similar anode material showed a satisfactory 

stability towards fuel cell tests in CH4 [315], possibly due to inhibited methane reforming over the manganite 

which enables to preserve the local oxygen pressure high enough to stabilize the perovskite. 

Summarizing the results observable on manganite-based anodes one should note that the dominant 

part of the electrodes studied contains large amounts of additives, in particular a layer of metal-containing 

paste. These modifications do not allow to evaluate the applicability of manganite-based anodes in industrial 

scale. One should take into account that high-temperature utilization of manganites may be detrimental in 

terms of poor chemical stability, drop in the electronic conductivity, microstructural changes and mechanical 

degradation of the electrode layers. Therefore, for industrial application of (La,A)MnO3-?-based anodes 

without expensive modifications one should achieve reasonable performances at comparatively low 

temperatures (950 - 1100 K). Reviewing the available data on manganites, no proper anode composition has 

been found by far. At the same time, the attractive characteristics of manganite perovskites offer many 

possibilities to improve both activity and stability by compositional modifications.

1.4. La(Cr,Mn)O3-?-based electrode materials 

 

A brief description of (Ln,A)(Cr,Mn)O3-?-based materials (LnACM) and corresponding anodes has 

been given in the sections devoted to chromites and manganites. One of the most widely studied 

representatives is La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-?, since this material possesses a good combination of the chemical 

and thermomechanical properties, electronic transport and catalytic activity. On the other hand, further 

optimization of the composition can be achieved. This material and its derivatives are characterized by a 

structural transition on heating or reduction which, however, has no detrimental effects on the transport or 

thermomechanical properties [113, 177]. In reducing atmospheres, small quantities of MnO and Ln2O3 or 

RP-phases may be separated [207, 216, 222], while Ruiz-Morales et al. reported a possibility of formation of 

ordered structures, which, however, might also relate to the RP-manganites [353]. While under oxidizing 

conditions the conductivity increases on A-site doping (Ca&gt;Sr&gt;Ba) [144] and with Mn content [210], in 

anodic atmospheres this trend depends on the facility and kinetics of the oxygen losses, as shown in Fig. 

1.2.4 and Table 1.2.1. The conductivity of LnACM materials at low p(O2) varies in the range 0.2 - 5 S/cm, 

close to the minimum acceptable for the anode application. 

The thermal expansion coefficients of LnACM are close or slightly higher than those of SOFC 

electrolytes or interconnects. The chemical expansivity for Ln = La is 0.2 - 0.3 % at 1073 - 1273 K, p(O2) = 

10-18 - 10-13 atm [10, 235]. Replacement of La by Ce increases the expansion up to 0.45 - 0.7% on mild 

reduction and causes the phase decomposition at p(O2) lower than 10
-14 - 10-11 atm [207]. Due to variations of 

ionic radii of the B-cations, different reducibility and electron exchange between Cr and Mn species and 

Mn3+ disproportionation, the effect of Mn:Cr ratio at various cation compositions on the expansion may be 

opposite [10, 207, 235]. Despite the moderate expansivity, poor adhesion of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? to YSZ 

was reported [354]; this drawback can be solved by fabrication of composites. 

In comparison with Cr-rich perovskites, the ionic transport and surface kinetics are substantially 

enhanced for LnACM, especially under reducing conditions [10, 258]. This is attributed to higher tendency 

of Mn-containing perovskites towards formation of oxygen vacancies [8]. The presence of Mn is expected to 

promote participation of bulk oxygen in oxidation processes [347]. At the same time, the ionic transport is 

obviously insufficient for adequate performance; in particular, this is reflected by reducing the polarization 

for composites of LnACM with ionic conductors (Figs. 1.4.1 - 1.4.2, Table 1.4.1)  

La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? and Pr0.7Ca0.3(Cr,Mn)O3-? are chemically compatible with YSZ at 1573 and 

1473 K, respectively [8, 210, 277]. Despite the decreased phase stability, the presence of Ce ensures better 

chemical compatibility with YSZ in air, while in Ar or H2, formation of SrZrO3 and strong interdiffusion 

were observed [222]. In contact of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? with LSGM, the interaction was observed at 

1623 - 1673 K [279, 280]. No interaction or interdiffusion between La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? and Co-

substituted LSGM was detected up to 1573 K [355]; the anode material exhibited also the chemical 

compatibility with Ni at 1673 K which facilitates the fabrication of composites. 

On the other hand, Mn possesses enhanced diffusivity [324, 356], and analogously with manganite-

based electrodes, application of LnACM necessitates application of buffer layers between the electrode and 

electrolyte. The diffusivity of Mn is promoted by A-cation deficiency; however, one should take into account 



63 

 

that for cation-stoichiometric perovskites, depletion with Mn induces phase decomposition with formation of 

phases enriched with A-cations. Since electrodes based on cation-stoichiometric perovskites basically require 

elevated preparation temperatures [357] and are more susceptible towards the high-temperature interdiffusion 

or decomposition, application of A-deficient perovskite electrodes may be beneficial. 

One of advantages of LnACM-based compositions is some catalytic activity towards oxidation 

processes; this makes the materials attractive as a component of catalysts or anodes in hydrocarbon fuels. In 

particular, higher content of La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? in composite with CGO increases the open circuit 

voltage of a cell with CH4-containing atmosphere on the anode side, indicating an enhanced conversion over 

La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? [284]. As suggested in [348, 358], Mn-doping into LnACM promotes the oxidation 

processes which proceed via Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism where the bulk oxygen ions participate in the 

oxidation; the activity is higher for Mn-enriched perovskites [347]. The effect of Mn species originates from 

the capability of Mn3+ species to accept electrons in chemisorption step producing low-coordinated Mn2+ and 

release CO2 and H2O [218]. In H2, the oxidation process is considered to be limited by the chemisorption step 

rather than by diffusion of O2- and subsequent oxidation of Mn2+. Formation of Mn2+ reduces the electronic 

conduction and decreases the number of available sites for chemisorption [218]. This behaviour is consistent 

with observation of McIntosh et al [347] where formation of oxygen vacancies reduces CH4 conversion over 

La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? and increases the fraction of CO in the product mixture. The material promotes 

essentially partial oxidation and dry reforming, while the rate of the wet reforming is slow. 

Whatever the oxidation mechanism, the catalytic activity of pure LnACM perovskites is insufficient 

for utilizing these materials as individual anode [348]; in combination with the disadvantages caused by the 

transport properties, compositional modifications of the electrodes are required. Positive effects of additions 

of Pd, Rh, Fe, Ni or ceria have been demonstrated [10, 14, 359, 360], possibly due to improved catalytic 

activity. In particular, surface modification of the perovskite electrodes with Pd was shown to improve the 

activity in CH4 and ethanol, without significant effect on the performance in H2 [361-363]. 

At the same time, the most important factor determining the performance of LnACM anodes is 

insufficient electronic conductivity. In particular, for non-modified La0.7A0.3Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? anodes, the 

performance increased in the order Ba&lt;Sr&lt;Ca, consistently with the electronic conduction and stability of the 

materials [144]. A similar correlation was observed for LaCr0.5Mn0.5O3-? and La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? anodes, 

where the former composition possesses higher electronic conduction and catalytic activity at low p(O2) 

[171]. Analogously, increasing Mn content in Pr0.7Ca0.3Cr1-xMnxO3-? from x = 0.2 to 0.8 leads to ~1 order 

enhancement of the conductivity and anode performance [210]. Apart from increasing the polarization 

resistance, the insufficient conductivity leads to higher Ohmic drops [171]. On the other hand, the anodic 

polarization may induce partial oxidation of the perovskite resulting in higher electronic transport. 

The role of the electronic conductivity of LnACM in the electrochemical processes is also 

confirmed by positive effects of addition of metallic phase or optimization of the current collector on the 

polarization. In particular, an improvement of the anode performance by impregnation of 

La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? with Cu was demonstrated in [218, 361, 353, 364]. Since contribution of Cu into the 

catalytic activity is suggested to be insignificant [353, 364, 365], the smaller polarization losses are attributed 

to the improved electronic transport.

Enhancing the electronic conductivity by introduction of metallic phase or compositional 

modifications generally reduces the activation energy of the electrochemical performance, as shown in Fig. 

1.4.1. The presence of CeO2-?-based phases in the composite anode also diminishes the Ea, possibly due to 

contribution to the electronic transport, although increased ionic conduction or catalytic activity may have the 

activating effect as well. At the same time, introducing YSZ into the anode increases the activation energy 

attributable to worse percolation of the electron-conductive paths in the composite or to a change of the 

electrode mechanism. 

The anode La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? with Au paste current collector exhibited quite reasonable 

power densities (400 - 600 mW/cm2 at 1073 K) in H2 - H2O - Ar fuel with LSGM electrolyte as thick as 2 

mm; however, no stability was checked in the study [279]. Impregnation of the anode with Pt and Cu allows 

to achieve power densities as high as 850 mW/cm2 in dry H2 at 1123 K and 450 mW/cm
2 in dry CH4 at 1073 

K [218]. Stable performance (for at least 24 hours) of 320 - 550 mW/cm2 and R? of  0.18 - 0.29 Ohm×cm
2 at 

1223 K was observed for La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? - YSZ - Pt composite electrode in wet H2 atmospheres, 

while in wet CH4, the power density and R? were 350 mW/cm
2 and 0.26 Ohm×cm2, respectively [366]. 

Composite anodes based on (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? showed a noticeable activity towards conversion of wet C3H8 

[367], wet ethanol [368] (stable for 60 hours), 0.5% H2S - CH4 [212]. The preferability of 

La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? - Cu anodes over analogous CGO - Cu cermets was reported [364]. 

 
 
1.5. Perovskite-related titanates with high electronic conductivity 

 

The present section concerns phase and structural relationships, their influence on the electronic, 

oxygen- and hydrogen ionic conductivity as well as on the thermomechanical and electrochemical behaviour. 

A particular attention is focused on kinetic factors which are essentially important for titanate-based 

materials. Although Ti-enriched solid oxides include several structural groups such as pyrochlores, tungsten 

bronzes, spinels, etc. which may also be regarded as potential candidates for the anode utilization ([7, 14, 91, 

102, 103] and references cited), the present consideration will be restricted by ATiO3-? (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) 

compositions and their derivatives possessing the perovskite structure. 

 

1.5.1. Defect chemistry mechanisms under oxidizing and reducing conditions 

 
The defect structure of titanate-based compositions significantly differs from that of previously 

considered perovskites. Since Cr and Mn can exist in 4+/3+ or 4+/3+/2+ oxidation state, respectively, in a 

wide operational range of oxygen pressures, the corresponding compositions are tolerant towards reasonable 

introduction of aliovalent dopants, without any significant formation of secondary phases, while the 

functional characteristics of the materials continuously change with the concentration of the substituent. In 

titanates, Ti4+ dominates under oxidizing conditions; the onset of generation of noticeable fractions of Ti3+ is 

located at p(O2)&lt;10
-7 atm at 1473 K [371]. Therefore, titanates are much less flexible towards doping in 

terms of the phase purity, and their defect chemistry is strongly related with variations in the phase 



67 

 

composition. For simplicity, the basic relationships of the defect chemistry will be given for model 

composition SrTiO3-? and its derivatives, although similar equations are also relevant for CaTiO3-?- and 

BaTiO3-?-based analogues. 

Generalized approaches consider that the defect species in undoped SrTiO3-? are electrons ( e? ), holes 

( hi ) and vacancies in Sr, Ti and O sublattices, denoted as 
SrV??

, ''''
TiV

 and 
OV
ii . The corresponding concentrations 

are denoted as n, p, 
Sr[V ]??

, ''''
Ti[V ]

 and 
O[V ]
ii . Moreover, most titanates are susceptible towards minor amounts of 

acceptor-type impurities [372-375] and the conductivity trends may adequately be described only assuming 

the presence of acceptor cations in A or B sublattice, schematically denoted as 
CA?
 with the concentration 

C[A ]?
. Within the model considered below, the distribution of the acceptor between A- and B-sublattices is 

considered to be non-important in terms of the transport properties. 

The defect chemistry in undoped SrTiO3-? is associated with the processes of oxygen vacancy 

formation and dissolution of SrO in the perovskite structure, with the expression of the equilibrium constants:

Depending on the values of the equilibrium constants and the level of intentionally introduced or

, the compensation mechanism is strongly affected by the cation stoichiometry 

and oxygen pressure. Selected examples of the compensation mechanisms for BaTiO3-? as well as the slopes 

of the fraction of p- and n-type carriers vs. p(O2) (in logarithmic scale) are shown in Fig. 1.5.1. 

One of peculiarities of titanate-based perovskites is the appearance of p-type and n-type branches of 

the total conductivity, observable even on undoped titanates. The generation of large amounts of holes is 

compensated by formation of cation vacancies in A- or B-sublattice. In accordance with the diagram, the 

slopes in the logarithmic plot of the total conductivity vs. p(O2) for SrTiO3-? should change in the order -1/6, -

1/4, +1/4, +1/6 upon oxidation, assuming comparable mobilities of p- and n-type electronic carriers. In 

practice, the value of p(O2) corresponding to the change in the value of the positive slope is generally located 

beyond the experimental conditions. Increasing the temperature favors the formation of oxygen vacancies 

and thus shifts the changes in the compensation mechanisms to higher values of p(O2). Although the oxygen 

deficiency as large as 0.28 was observed in SrTiO3-? [376], under typical experimental conditions variations 

in the oxygen content on redox cycling in SrTiO3-? and BaTiO3-? do not exceed 0.002 - 0.004 per perovskite 

formula unit [248, 377-379]. Nevertheless, even such negligible changes in the defect concentration cause a 

~2-fold enhancement of the n-type conductivity.

mode; m is the slope of the dependencies log p = m log p(O2) and log n = -m log p(O2) under given 
conditions. Red lines correspond to cation-stoichiometric composition. 

 

In accordance with the diagrams (Figs. 1.5.1 - 1.5.2) even minor deviations from the cation 

stoichiometry or a contamination of titanates with donor- or acceptor-type impurities significantly affects the 

defect equilibrium ([372, 373, 380] and references cited). This leads to large discrepancies between the data 

on the total conductivity obtained in various studies; the difference is especially pronounced in the range of 

p-n transition and on the branch of p-type conductivity, due to a relatively small concentration of the charge 

carriers and their strong susceptibility towards the factors discussed above.

Due to relatively small cation radii of Ca and Sr, the formation of A-site cation vacancies dominates 

in CaTiO3-? and SrTiO3-? [381, 383-385]. Whenever the cation vacancy compensation mechanism is realized 

in CaTiO3-? or SrTiO3-?, this results in separation of Ca- or Sr-enriched phases or, more likely, generation of 

domains of RP-intergrowths in the perovskite structure [375, 381, 385]. The ratios of Ca:Ti or Sr:Ti where 

single perovskite phase exists are scattered in the literature and strongly depend on the processing conditions. 

The acceptable level of Ca- or Sr-deficiency varies in the range 0.1 - 10% [376, 386-390], while Sr:Ti ratio as 

low as 0.8:1 causes formation of superstructures with ordering in A- and O-sublattice [391]. For Ca1+xTiO3-?, 

the maximum acceptable value of x was assessed up to 0.01% [392]; similar value for Sr1+xTiO3-? was 

evaluated as 0.2% [390]. 

In contrast, the high-p(O2) charge compensation in BaTiO3-? is accompanied by dominating 

formation of Ti vacancies [371, 393, 394] causing separation of Ti-enriched phases, such as BaTi2O5, 

Ba6Ti11O40, etc. [371, 381, 382, 395]. The perovskite phase exists in a narrow domain of Ba:Ti ratio; the 

excess of Ba or Ti should not exceed 0.1 - 1 mol.% [382, 396].  No formation RP-phases has been reported 

for BaTiO3-? [381, 397]. On the other hand, an enrichment of BaTiO3-? with rare-earth cations allows to 

stabilize the RP-structures [398]. 

An important feature of the titanates of alkali-earth metals is their complex structural behavior. 

CaTiO3-? is orthorhombically-distorted perovskite (S.G.: Pbmn) adopting the tetragonal perovskite structure 

at 1500 - 1600 K, followed by the transformation into the cubic symmetry at 1635 K [399, 400]. On heating 

from the room temperature, BaTiO3-? consequently exhibits transformations from tetragonal (S.G.: P4mm) 

into cubic (393 K) and into hexagonal structure (~1700 K) possessing S.G.: P63/mmc [401, 402]. In terms of 

the structural stability, SrTiO3-? is more preferable for the high-temperature applications, since this perovskite 

exists in the cubic modification ( 3Pm m ) at T&gt;105 K, without transformations on heating [403, 404]. 

Introduction of nonreducible rare-earth donor cations (i.e. Ln) into A-sublattice is accompanied by 

either electronic compensation at low p(O2) or cation vacancy formation taking place under oxidizing 

conditions [388, 405]. The 3rd possibility involving the formation of ordered structures where Ti may be 

stabilized in 3+ state at atmospheric oxygen pressure is beyond the present consideration. If the cation 

stoichiometry does not support any of the mechanisms, the compensation is accompanied by the formation of 

secondary phases. For example, stoichiometric (Sr,La)TiO3-? may be synthesized at low p(O2) due to 

equivalent formation of Ti3+ species; however, their oxidation destabilizes the  perovskite structure with 

resultant formation of  Sr-enriched impurities or, as a particular case, RP-titanate intergrowths in the 

perovskite structure (schematically denoted as SrO) [406, 407]:

   (Eq. 1.5.5) 

 

In contrast, generation of appropriate amounts of cation vacancies results in stabilization of titanates 

in air. However, the coexistence of vacancies in A- and O-sublattice in reducing atmospheres makes the 

excess of Ti unfavorable in terms of the phase stability which results in separation of Magneli phases TinO2n-

1, Magneli layers accommodated into the perovskite structure or other Ti-rich compositions [377, 388, 406]:

Similar relationships were observed on introduction of donor dopants into B-sublattice. In particular, 

Nb5+ is less reducible in comparison with Ti4+, and Nb-substitution into BaTiO3-? with overall deficiency of 

B-cations results in formation of single phase perovskite in air and segregation of Ba-enriched impurities in 

N2. In contrast, BaTi0.94Nb0.06O3-? is single phase perovskite when prepared in N2, while oxidation provokes 

generation of Ti-vacancies in the perovskite and decomposition into Ti-enriched compounds. Such a behavior 

is consistent with the examples presented for (Sr,La)TiO3-? system, with the exception that BaTiO3-? shows 

the tendency towards Ti vacancy formation ([395] and references cited). 

Whatever the phase relationships, donor doping into ATiO3-? induces the appearance of a region 

where the amount of charge carriers (and, consequently, the electronic conductivity) is independent of p(O2) 

(Fig. 5.2). One should note that within the defect model considered by most authors ([381, 395] and 

references therein), the defect concentration is considered to be independent of Ln content under fixed p(O2) 

in the low oxygen pressure region. However, such a simplification assumes an equal level of the oxygen 

deficiency for titanates with various donor amounts. Analysis of the literature data on reducibility does not 

allow to verify this suggestion since apparent variations of oxygen content upon redox cycling might be 

attributed to formation/dissolution of the secondary phases capable to accommodate/release large oxygen 

amounts [247, 248, 408-410]. 

Higher amounts of donor dopants increase the n-type conductivity in the intermediate- and high-

p(O2) regions and expand the domain of p(O2)-independent conductivity. Considering the behavior of Nb- or 

V-doped titanates, one should mention that under severe high-temperature reducing conditions Ti3+ coexists 

with the corresponding cations in low oxidation states. This leads to a substantial oxygen uptake observable 

on oxidation (0.05 - 0.1 per perovskite formula unit) in comparison with other titanate materials [410, 411] 

and may cause significant irreversible changes of the functional properties. 

Reduction of cation stoichiometric Sr1-xLaxTiO3-? enables to dissolve up to x = 0.3 - 0.4 with 

preservation of single cubic perovskite structure [412, 413]. In air, the solubility drops down to 4% [414, 

415]; on further doping, La2Ti2O7 is separated. A possibility of preparation of heavily-doped (30 - 40%) Sr1-

xLaxTiO3-? in air has been reported [105, 409]; in [105], the cubic perovskite phases were stable on annealing 

at 1923 K in air and under reducing conditions. These results seem to be affected by kinetic stabilization or 

low sensitivity of the examination techniques towards formation of impurities or superstructures, since 

Sr0.6La0.4TiO3-? should contain at least 40% of Ti
3+, which is hardly possible in oxidizing atmospheres. More 

reliable in this respect seems the separation of Sr-rich phases which forms Sr-O layers in the perovskite 

structure with A-site deficiency, similar to RP-phases (mainly, Sr2TiO4-?, Sr3Ti2O7-?, etc.)  [408, 416, 417]. 

Such a structure enables to accommodate both Sr vacancies (in perovskite blocks) and excessive oxygen and 

strontium (in Sr-O planes) and thus realize the charge compensation in air. 

Introducing equivalent amounts of A-site cation vacancies in Sr1-3x/2LaxTiO3-? ensures La solubility 

up to x = 0.4 in air [377, 418] with the preservation of the cubic structure; further generation of cation 

vacancies induces short- or long-range ordering in A-sublattice [96, 418, 419]. Sr0.7La0.2TiO3-? was reported 



71 

 

to be stable under reducing and oxidizing conditions [420], possibly due to kinetic factors. Increasing La 

content up to 20 - 40% promotes the transition tetragonal-cubic at 300 - 450 K on heating in air [418]. 

The solubility of Y in cation-stoichiometric SrTiO3-? is as low as 1% [414]; reduction allows to 

accommodate up to 7% of Y without destabilization of the cubic perovskite structure. On the other hand, 

according to Das et al. [421], Ca1-xYxTiO3-? and Sr1-xYxTiO3-? solid solutions exist in the entire compositional 

range. The maximum content of Y in A-site vacancy-compensated (Sr,Y)TiO3-? is assessed to be 4 - 8% [406, 

410, 414] and may be preserved down to reducing conditions. Exceeding Y content results in separation of 

Y2Ti2O7 and TiO2 rather than to generation of RP-phases [406, 414, 422]. 

CaTiO3-?-based perovskites exhibit essentially the same phase relationships as SrTiO3-?-based 

analogues. Ca1-xLaxTiO3-? might be produced single-phase in air with presumably GdFeO3-like orthorhombic 

structure (S.G.: Pbnm) in the range 0?x?0.3 [423]. Further enrichment with La results in transition into 

the 3R c  symmetry and a gradual accumulation of Ca2La4Ti6O20 and CaLa4Ti5O17 phases [423]. Similar to Sr- 

or La-rich (Sr,La)TiO3-?, formation of RP-titanate superstructures is also relevant to (Ca,La)TiO3-? [380, 392]. 

For A-site deficient Ca1-3x/2LaxTiO3-?, simple orthorhombic perovskite phase, slightly contaminated by TiO2, 

was obtained up to x = 0.33 exhibiting a phase transition on La-doping owing to tilting the octahedra or 

cation vacancy ordering [424]. Ba1-xLaxTiO3-? may accommodate as much as 3% of La in air, the symmetry 

increasing with La content [371, 425]. At higher La amounts, phases like Ba6Ti11O40 or Ba6La8Ti18O54 are 

separated confirming the preferential formation of Ti vacancies in BaTiO3-?-based perovskites. 

Nb solubility in air without intentional creation of cation vacancies may be accomplished up to 2% 

in SrTi1-xNbxO3-? [426]; the excessive amount is separated as Sr2NbO4 phase. On the other hand, Nb can be 

stabilized in the titanate structure by Ti/Nb reduction at low p(O2) or enhanced temperatures; in the latter 

case, formation of Sr(Ti,Nb)O3-? may be achieved in air up to 9% Nb even with 1% deficiency in B-sublattice 

[413]. The cubic structure of Sr(Ti,Nb)O3-? is maintained on Nb-doping within the solubility domain. 

Introducing Nb with simultaneous generation of cation vacancies (Sr1-x/2Ti1-xNbxO3-?) allows to substitute up 

to 40% of Ti; the materials are stable in air and under reducing conditions [96, 97]. Further enrichment with 

Nb necessitates an additional amount of A-site vacancies for charge compensation, which causes formation 

of secondary phase with tetragonal tungsten bronze structure [96, 97]. For Nb-doped BaTiO3-?, Ti deficiency 

is necessary for Nb dissolution; the composition BaTi0.926Nb0.06O3-? was found to be stable in air forming Ba-

rich phase on reduction [395]. 

Comparing the behavior of acceptor-doped and so-called pure SrTiO3-? (Fig. 1.5.1), one may 

conclude that the presence of acceptors shifts the p-n transition of the total conductivity towards more 

reducing conditions and introduces an additional domain in the p-type conductivity branch, where the 

concentration of charge carriers is essentially determined by the concentration of acceptor cations, i.e. the 

conductivity is p(O2)-independent. However, under experimental conditions, any accurate separation of the 

compensation regimes is complicated by kinetic factors and a strong contribution of the ionic conductivity. 

Thus, typical p(O2) dependencies of the conductivity exhibit a wide p-n transition, where the conductivity 

remains on a nearly constant low level. 

The presence of transition metal cations which vary their oxidation state under operation conditions 

may have a multiple effect on the defect chemistry of titanates, depending on the redox potential, 



72 

 

concentration, the presence of irreducible acceptor or donor atoms (including impurities), defect interactions 

etc. As shown in Fig. 1.5.2, in Mn-doped BaTiO3-?, Mn species in the oxidation state +3 and +4 may coexist 

with the electrons delocalized in 3d-conduction band of Ti atoms. Details of the defect equilibrium for 

(A,Ln)(Ti,B)O3-? systems (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, B = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) may be found elsewhere [155, 372, 374, 

412, 427-431]. Generally, the p-n transition also shifts to lower p(O2) attributable to increasing contribution 

of electron holes. Doping of reducible Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu promotes higher oxygen losses (0.03 - 0.05 per 

perovskite formula unit) [247, 335] and may significantly affect the behavior of the parent compositions. 

The solubility of acceptor-type dopants with a fixed or variable oxidation state in CaTiO3-?, SrTiO3-?, 

BaTiO3-? has been studied in [432-439] and references cited. Depending on the oxidation state, reducibility 

and ionic radius of the guest atom as well as on the nature of A-cation in the titanate, the solubility of the 

acceptor-type cations varies in the range 5 - 40 mol. %. For example, up to 40% Al might be incorporated 

into CaTiO3-?, while for SrTiO3-? analogue the solubility was limited only by 20%, possibly due to 

comparatively small radius for Al3+ and Ca2+ cations ensuring the optimum tolerance factor. At the same 

time, both Ca(Ti,Fe)O3-? and Sr(Ti,Fe)O3-? form a continuous series of solid solutions, with formation of 

ordered structures at 40 - 50% of the dopant [428, 440-442]. The solubility of acceptors in titanates as well as 

their phase and structural stability may be modified by the presence of appropriate quantities of Ln3+, Nb5+ or 

other donor-type cations [16, 429, 431, 443, 444]. Depending on the cation ratios and synthesis conditions, 

single phase perovskites (A,La)(Ti,B)O3-? (A = Ca, Sr, B = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co) may be produced in the entire 

range of Ti:B ratios, especially when Sr(Ca):Ti ratio is preserved close to 1. The crystal structure exhibits 

orthorhomic distortions on increasing Fe or Cr amount, while Mn- promotes the transition to rhombohedral 

symmetry. For Co-doped (Sr,La)TiO3-? the structure was refined to be orthorhombic or rhombohedral, 

depending on La and Co content [12, 16, 156, 158, 352, 431, 444, 445]. In terms of the application in a wide 

p(O2) and temperature range, one should take into account possible phase decomposition and structural 

transformations on thermal or redox cycling observable for Mn, Fe, Co or Ni-substituted titanates at low 

p(O2) [16, 372, 429, 437, 440-442, 446]. 

On the other hand, the presence of acceptor-type dopants increases the solubility limit of donor 

substituents which enables to tune the functional properties of titanates. In particular, doping of (Sr,La)TiO3-? 

with Sc enables to introduce larger quantities of La with preserving the cubic perovskite structure [447]. 

Similar improvement of the solubility of donor-type cations was observed for Sr0.9(Ti,Ga,Nb)O3-? and 

(Ca,Na)(Ti,Ta)O3-? perovskites; in the latter case,  co-introduction of Na and Ta into A- and B-sublattice of 

CaTiO3-? allows to stabilize the composition up to the complete substitution in both sublattices [448, 449]. 

 

1.5.2. Redox kinetics 

 

One of most important factors influencing the functional characteristics of titanate perovskites is a 

strong effect of the relaxation kinetics upon p(O2) changes on the functional properties. An incomplete 

equilibration causes a poor reliability of the experimental results, large scattering between literature data, 

hysteresis behavior of the material properties on redox cycling and their strong dependence on the synthesis 

conditions and measurement procedure; examples of such a behavior are presented in Fig. 1.5.3. The kinetics 



73 

 

strongly depends on the ceramics microstructure. Equilibration of porous ceramics proceeds faster, due to 

large surface area and shorter distances from the surface to the bulk phase [247, 377, 420]. However, 

utilization of porous ceramic samples is inappropriate for determination of the ionic conductivity while the 

total conductivity requires a correction for the porosity. At the same time, for porous anode layers, the 

equilibration is expected to proceed in a reasonable period. The grain size, utilization of single crystal or film 

samples has also a great influence on the relaxation indicating a different rate of the bulk- and grain 

boundary-related processes [247, 248, 377, 450].

Fig. 1.5.3. Equilibration of the total conductivity and oxygen content variations for selected titanates upon 
p(O2) changes 

 

 

In accordance with most studies, the redox kinetics for dense ceramic titanate-based materials is 

governed by slow oxygen diffusion in the bulk [247, 248, 377, 414]. Correspondingly, the basic trends in the 

equilibration rate and mechanism of the relaxation are generally consistent with the behavior of the oxygen 

ionic conductivity. Analysis of the literature data does not allow to make a conclusion whether the rate of 

oxidation is superior to that of reduction or contrary [105, 247, 249, 411, 420]; the faster kinetics of any of 

the processes is primarily associated with individual characteristics of the sample rather than with general 

trends. Most authors note that both processes proceed rapidly on the initial stage followed by subsequent drift 

with much slower rate. Such a behavior indicates that oxygen incorporation/elimination into/from ceramics 



74 

 

proceeds in several steps. A possible mechanism suggests that the penetration of oxygen initially occurs into 

regions at the interfaces between the grains. In accordance with the defect model of titanates, this results in a 

drop of the population of oxygen vacancies and n-type carriers in the oxidized regions of the ceramics 

causing a sharp initial decrease of the electronic conductivity. Subsequent oxidation of the material is 

determined by oxygen exchange between the oxidized exterior zone and reduced grain core. Although the 

process is driven by a large gradient in oxygen chemical potential between these states, the rate of the latter 

process is much lower [247, 248, 377, 414]. 

Analogously, on the onset of supply of reductive atmosphere to preliminary oxidized titanate-based 

materials, fast reduction of the layers close to the surface of the sample or grain boundaries provides 

percolative paths for the electronic transport thus ensuring the initial rise of the total conductivity. Further 

propagation of reducing front into the grain is limited by slow oxygen diffusivity of the oxidized domains, 

while the contribution from deeper layers into the total conductivity is less significant. The decaying kinetics 

is also affected by increasing distance from the grain surface to the reductive front [377, 247]. 

In accordance with higher oxygen vacancy concentration, an acceleration of the redox processes for 

(Sr,Ln)TiO3-? was observed upon introduction of low-valent Ga, Al, Sc, Fe, Co or Cu, while decreasing the 

oxygen deficiency on V-, Nb-, La-doping inhibits the oxygen diffusion-related processes thus suppressing the 

equilibration rates [247, 380, 414, 447]. As a particular example, introduction of Ga into (Sr,La)TiO3-? 

promotes the reducibility of the parent composition due to lower oxidation state of Ga and its flexibility 

towards variations in the oxygen environment. On the other hand, evaporation of Ga in reductive 

atmospheres results in formation of Ga-depleted layer on the surface with a poor oxygen ionic conductivity, 

thus making the material more tolerant towards oxidation [248]. 

Another important factor affecting the redox kinetics is associated with formation/dissolution of 

secondary phases induced by variations of oxygen pressure. Basically, variations in the phase composition 

are accompanied by appearance of large stresses in the material structure or microstructure; therefore, the 

processes described by Eqs (1.5.5) - (1.5.6) proceed with inhibited rates. Moreover, the secondary phase-

related proceses are determined by cation diffusion which is low in titanates [395, 406]. The slow rate of 

formation/dissolution of the impurities as well as phase transitions on redox cycles may lead to formation of 

inhomogeneous zones where the local composition deviates from the average one (donor-rich regions, 

domains with ordered oxygen vacancies, etc.) [371, 413, 451]. 

Slow equilibration may significantly affect the theoretically expected behaviour, primarily in terms 

of electronic transport. Generally, most p(O2) dependencies of the conductivity are affected by the degree of 

oxidation or reduction in each point rather than by the variations in the charge carrier concentration predicted 

by the defect model; the influence of parameters determining the kinetics on the transport properties is 

demonstrated in Fig. 1.5.4. 

In terms of anode applications, the slow equilibration kinetics necessitates a preliminary high-

temperature reduction of titanate-based anodes in order to achieve maximum electronic and ionic 

conductivity of the material. On the other hand, the susceptibility of titanates towards oxidation and resultant 

irreversible drop of the conductivity (Fig. 1.5.3), necessitates to avoid an occasional oxidation of the anodes. 

These requirements represent one of the most serious disadvantages of titanate anodes [105, 411, 452].

1.5.3. Total conductivity 

 

Depending on the composition, structural or microstructural characteristics, preparation conditions 

and measurement procedure, titanate materials may exhibit dielectric, semiconducting, metallic-like, 

superconducting or ferroelectric properties [453-456]. The present consideration will be restricted primarily 

by the behaviour in the high-temperature interval. 

In cubic perovskite lattice, Ti atom is located in the octahedral environment with oxygen. This 

results in splitting of the orbitals in 3d-level of Ti into eg and t2g sublevels, while 2p orbitals from oxygen 

split into high-energy 2p(?) and low-energy 2p(?) levels. The overlap between 3eg and 2p(?) as well as 

between 3t2g and 2p(?) orbitals causes formation of ?- and ?-like bands in the electronic structure of the 

titanates. The electrons of alkali earth metals occupy preferentially low-energy bands, since the bands 

associated with the corresponding cations are characterized by significantly higher energies [457, 458]. Such 

electron structure of the titanate-based compositions ensures location of Fermi level between the completely 

occupied bonding P? band and shallow ?*(t2g) band. The bandgap of “ideal” SrTiO3-? is as large as 3.1 - 3.8 

eV which ensures the insulating nature of the material [458, 459]. On the other hand, reduction of Ti induced 

by formation of oxygen vacancies or introduction of donor cations results in a partial occupation of the 

?*(t2g) conduction band with electrons and appearance of band-type conduction mechanism which is 

especially pronounced under reducing conditions. The electron mobilities are proportional to T-M, where M 

varies from 2.7 at room temperature down to 1.5 - 2 at 1000 K [381, 457, 460]. 



76 

 

Variations in the charge carrier concentration or band structure may induce changes in the effective 

mass of the electrons and partial localization of the electrons ensuring large polaron or small polaron 

conduction mechanism, while the electron transport changes from the metallic-like to semiconducting 

behavior. One should note that the Arrhenius-like behavior, typical for semiconductors and observable on 

titanates under oxidizing conditions might also be associated with temperature-induced minor oxygen losses 

leading to generation of additional electrons. Whatever the mechanism of the charge carrier formation and 

their transport, the conductivity of undoped or donor-doped ATiO3-? (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) under reducing 

conditions may exceed 100 - 1000 S/cm and slightly increases on cooling, beneficial for the IT-SOFC 

applications. Kinetic limitations may induce deviations between the experimental results and theoretically 

predicted dependencies; selected examples are presented in Fig. 1.5.4. Such a behavior complicates 

comparison of the literature data and only outlines the basic trends typical for titanates. 

In accordance with the defect model, in the high-p(O2) range, titanate-based materials are 

characterized by p-type electronic conduction, attributable to the formation of cation vacancies and 

equivalent generation of electron holes. One should note that the appearance of the p-type conductivity 

branch in oxidizing atmospheres with the same slope has been observed on doped ZrO2, HfO2 and related 

compositions [26, 461, 462]. 

The intrinsic conductivity in “pure” ATiO3-? (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) in the region of p-n transition is 

negligible due to the low concentration of charge carriers. In practice, however, the materials are strongly 

susceptible to the presence of impurities, self-disordering and other factors which induce the excitation of 

charges. This results in huge discrepancies between the experimental data, much more pronounced in 

comparison with LaCrO3-?, LaMnO3-? and other p-type conductors, possessing non-negligible levels of 

intrinsic charge carriers without intentional doping. Another consequence of the low concentration of the 

charge carriers in titanates relates to a strong effect of minor (1 - 2 mol.%) quantities of acceptor- or donor-

type dopants on the level of the total conductivity and the transport mechanism, as shown in Fig. 1.5.5. 

Consistently with the relationships presented in the defect model, donor-doped titanates exhibit the 

n-type conductivity in a wide p(O2) range. Upon reduction, the interval characterized by the slope of the 

conductivity vs. p(O2) in the logarithmic scale equal to -1/4 transforms into the region where the conductivity 

weakly depends on p(O2) followed by the domain with the slope of -1/6. As expected from the model, the 

intermediate-p(O2) region, where a weak influence of the oxygen pressure on the conductivity is observed, 

expands on donor-doping (Fig. 1.5.5). The concentration of mobile charge carriers in the intermediate p(O2) 

range is suggested to be temperature-independent [381, 460]. 

As follows from the defect model, in the low-p(O2) region the conductivity should be independent of 

the donor content under fixed p(O2), and the p(O2)-dependencies of the conductivity for titanates with various 

dopant level should converge into a single line (Fig. 1.5.2). This behavior cannot be verified due to the lack 

of experimental data in extremely reducing atmospheres, where such a regime should be realized. In 

oxidizing and moderately reducing conditions, the presence of donor-like dopants increases the fraction of 

the electrons in the conduction band, shifts the Fermi level and causes the appearance of additional levels in 

the bandgap facilitating the electron transitions [105, 381, 406, 412, 414, 460].

In this respect, the maximum effect is observed on doping with Nb cations, since the orbitals of 4d 

level of Nb have comparable energies to those of 3d level of Ti, which ensures a contribution of Nb species 

into the electron transfer, improves the overlapping between Ti 3d and O 2p orbitals and induces more 

significant modifications in the band structure, in particular shifts the conduction band towards lower 

energies [406, 407, 413]. Ru-doping has also been shown to improve the electron transport, possibly due to 

donation of an electron from Ru4+ to generate Ti3+ (Fig. 1.5.6) [463]. 

According to the defect model of titanates doped with irreducible acceptor-type cations, the p-n 

transition should be shifted towards reducing conditions, while in the oxidative domain a region of p(O2)-

independent electronic conductivity should appear on the high-p(O2) branch. In practice such a behavior is 

generally obscured by slow equilibration and dominating oxygen ionic conductivity which may exceed 80 - 

90% of the total one. As a result, such materials exhibit an extended (~10 orders of p(O2)) domain where the 

total conductivity is preserved on nearly constant low level (10-4 - 10-2 S/cm) (Fig. 1.5.7). The effect of 

acceptor content on the magnitude of the electronic conductivity may be multiple; as a general rule, the p-n 

transition shifts to lower p(O2) upon doping, while replacement of Ti with inert cations above a definite level 

hampers the electron mobility due to a smaller degree of overlapping between Ti 3d and O 2p orbitals.

A significant improvement was observed on introduction of cations with variable oxidation state, 

especially in the high-p(O2) range due to a stronger contribution of the p-type conductivity. As shown in Fig. 

1.5.8, the compositions exhibit a definite p-n transition, possibly due to faster equilibration or larger 

electronic transference numbers, whereas the behavior in the p- and n-conductivity branches depends on the 

nature and content of the dopant cation [155, 159, 372, 427, 428, 441, 443, 444]. The conductivity of 

A(Ti,B)O3-? (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, B = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) in the low p(O2) range is within 1 - 5 S/cm, but 

may be substantially increased by simultaneous donor-doping (Fig. 1.5.9.). In particular, Ga-, Mn-, Fe- or 

Co-doped (Sr,Y)TiO3-? or (Sr,La)TiO3-? are considered as promising materials for low-p(O2) applications, due 

to acceptable (up to 100 S/cm) electronic conductivity and sufficient tolerance towards moderate oxidation 

[247, 248, 335, 427].

The transport properties of titanate-based ceramics are substantially governed by microstructural 

characteristics, essentially pronounced at reduced temperatures. As can be inferred from literature data, the 

conductivity behavior for single crystal, film or ceramic materials with various grain size may be quite 

different [248, 380, 381, 465-467]; selected examples are shown in Fig. 1.5.5. One of the most common 

origins of the complex behavior is a non-uniform cation or defect distribution over the grain, such as an 

enrichment of the grain surface with Ti or acceptor-type dopants [451, 468, 469]. Slow oxygen diffusion 

into/out of the bulk phase on redox cycling also causes compositional differences over the grain, varying with 

time [247, 377]. Accumulation of immobile charges at the boundaries results in non-uniform distribution of 

electrons, holes or oxygen vacancies over the grain, deformation of the valence and conduction band with 

subsequent changes in their occupation with electrons and in the width of the bandgap [468, 470-472]. The 

factors indicated significantly affect the resistive properties of the grain exterior layers, while their large 

capacitance may cause trapping of the mobile charge carriers [384, 468, 473]. In particular, the conductivity 

of Ni-doped SrTiO3-? within a layer of the thickness of 30 - 200 nm at the grain interface was found to be 4 

orders lower compared with that in the bulk phase. Apart from the non-uniform cation distribution, formation 

of defect clusters [413, 474, 475] and phase separation at the grain boundaries were reported [371, 409, 413]. 

One should note that the grain surface-related limitations are typical for most mixed ionic/n-type conductors 

[30, 72, 476-478] and their effect reduces at elevated temperatures. More details on the grain boundary 

contribution into the electronic transport in titanates may be found in [380, 451, 468, 471, 479, 480] and 

references cited. 

 
 

1.5.4. Oxygen ionic and protonic conductivity: selected examples 

 
Due to complex defect chemistry of titanates and multiple transitions of the compensation 

mechanism, the chemical diffusion coefficient is strongly affected by changes in the concentration of p-, n-, 

OV
ii  and other charge carriers on variations of p(O2) or temperature, with resultant influence on the 

enhancement factor. In particular, in the region of p-n transition, the ionic conductivity becomes comparable 

or even higher than the electronic contribution (Table 1.5.1), while the ambipolar diffusion becomes limited 

by both ionic and electronic transport. Such a behavior is different from that of chromites and manganites, 

where the electronic transference number are close to unity in the entire p(O2) range. Basically, in the region 

of p-type conductivity, the chemical diffusion in titanates increases on reduction, exhibiting a maximum 

within the p-n transition region. Subsequent decrease in p(O2) reduces the diffusivity due to lowering the 

enhancement factor, while in the low-p(O2) range, the behavior is more scattered [492-494]. Such a complex 

behavior of the diffusion coefficients yields large discrepancies between experimental data which achieve 2-3 

orders of magnitude (Tables 1.5.2 - 1.5.3). In combination with incomplete equilibration and grain boundary-

related effects, the ionic transport becomes strongly influenced by preparation conditions, measurement 

procedure or the microstructure of the sample. Moreover, large variety of the experimental techniques and 

testing conditions complicates a direct comparison of the data on diffusion in titanates with those obtained for 

other perovskite groups.

Due to negligible concentration of electron-type charge carriers in the range of p-n transition, most 

titanates exhibit dominating oxygen ionic conduction in the intermediate-p(O2) range (Table 1.5.1). Selected 

titanates have been tested as solid electrolyte materials (in particular, the power density of 140 mW/cm2 was 

achieved for a cell with CaTi0.7Al0.3O3-? electrolyte membrane (350 µ m) [495]), although their application as 

pure ionic conductor is limited by a narrow interval of p(O2) where the electronic contribution is negligible.

Introduction of Ln cations basically reduces the ionic conduction and increases the corresponding 

activation energy. This trend is clearly demonstrated for Dy-doped SrTiO3-? [450]. One should note 

introduction of Ln cations into (A,Ln)TiO3-? may be accompanied by equivalent introduction of cation 

vacancies which might also be responsible for smaller diffusion coefficients and larger activation energies 

observed [377, 496-498]. 

Obviously, the ionic conductivity should be promoted by the presence of acceptor-type cations in B-

sublattice, with fixed or variable oxidation state [412, 428, 434, 441, 495, 499-501]. The effect of acceptor 

doping originates from lowering average oxidation state of B-site cations, weaker B-O bonds and more 

flexible oxygen coordination around cations in B-sublattice which facilitates formation of oxygen vacancies. 

Generally, the oxygen diffusivity proportionally increases with the dopant amount up to a definite 

level, while further doping induces the separation of secondary phases, structural transformations, defect 

interactions and formation of vacancy-ordered superstructures; two latter phenomena are especially 

pronounced for titanates enriched with Fe, Co, Ni or cations with the oxidation state lower than +3 [428, 434, 

436, 439, 441, 499, 501-503]. In accordance with calculations [441], the maximum oxygen diffusivity is 

expected for titanates doped with 20% of Fe; this doping level was confirmed by experimental data [441, 

503, 504]. Co-introduction of donor- and acceptor-type dopants into titanates has 2 opposite effects on the 

oxygen deficiency and ionic transport [427, 448, 501]; on the other hand, the presence of Ln-cations in A-

sublattice improves the stability and suppresses the vacancy ordering [501].

The reports on the exchange kinetics in titanates are scarce. This might be associated with wide 

uncertainties in the determination of the surface kinetics-related parameters due to dominant limitations by 

the bulk diffusion [247, 377, 492, 497, 505]. Ti atoms located at the surface significantly differ from those in 

the bulk phase in terms of crystal symmetry, oxygen coordination, strength of B-O bonds etc., which ensures 

faster rates of the surface processes [506, 507]. Selected experimental results presented in Tables 1.5.2 - 1.5.3 

and the equilibration behavior of titanates discussed earlier confirm accelerated rates of the oxygen exchange. 

Substitution of transition metal cations for titanium increases the contribution of the surface limitations 

which become essentially pronounced at elevated temperatures [439, 499, 508] due to more substantial 

improvement of the bulk ionic transport in comparison with the surface exchange. 

Finally, one should briefly consider a possible contribution of the protonic conduction into the 

overall ionic transport in titanates. The proton transport in most perovskites proceeds via so-called Grotthus 

mechanism which involves hopping of proton species from OH- groups located in the oxygen sites of the 

perovskite lattice to neighboring oxygen atoms ([514, 515] and references cited). Nevertheless, the nature of 

the protonic charge carriers in titanate-based perovskites is arguable. In particular, temperature- and p(O2)-

dependent behavior of the electromotive force (e.m.f) across a titanate-based membrane was attributed to 

migration of hydride species (H-) or associates of neutral hydrogen atoms or protons with electrons [514]. 

Although such a possibility was predicted from molecular dynamic simulations [516], formation of 

substantial amounts of hydride ions may be achieved only at extremely low p(O2) (&lt;10
-20 atm), located 

beyond testing conditions. Moreover, most cations, in particular Ti4+, cannot coexist with hydride species 

which may cause decomposition of the perovskite phase [517]. More reliable seems the assumption of 

participation of OH- groups in the protonic transfer mechanism. Generation of 
OOH
i  species in the oxygen 

sublattice proceeds in accordance with the process [502, 514, 515]:

As follows from Eq. (1.5.8),  the protonic diffusion is determined by proton migration enthalpy ?Hm and 

solubility of water in the perovskite structure. Since the enthalpy of the hydration process ?Hw is negative, 

the term (?Hw + 2?Hm) may adopt both positive and negative value; in the latter case, the protonic 

conduction should decrease on heating. 

Localization of protons on oxygen sites is considered to promote the transfer of 
OOH
i  species due to 

their smaller charge and ionic radius in comparison with 
OO
× . On the other hand, formation of 

OOH
i  groups 

induces lattice deformations, i.e. elongation of Ti-OH bonds and reduction of O-OH bonds in comparison 

with proton-free perovskite structure which causes additional stresses contributing into the overall activation 

energy of the protonic migration [518-520]. As shown by molecular dynamic simulations [518], CaTiO3-?- 

and SrTiO3-?-based perovskites support both the mechanism of the protonic hopping between two adjacent 



85 

 

oxygen atom within the same octahedron (intra-octahedral mechanism) and the mechanism involving 

participation of next-nearest neighboring O positions (inter-octahedral mechanism). 

Regardless of the specific mechanism of the migration, the protonic conductivity in titanates is 

rather low (10-5 - 10-4 at 873 - 1073 K, as can be observed from Table 1.5.4), which is primarily associated 

with low water solubility in titanates (&lt;1 mol.% [521]).

1.5.5. Thermomechanical behavior 

 

Similar to other characteristics of ATiO3-?-based compositions, the behaviour of thermal expansion 

coefficients is strongly influenced by synthesis and measuring conditions. Since most available literature data 

on the expansion of titanates are essentially presented by those, obtained by XRD studies, and relate to quite 

various temperature ranges, direct comparison of the TEC values is unreasonable. For example, depending on 

the temperature interval studied, BaTiO3-? has been reported to have extremely low TEC values (~3×10
-6 K-1 

at 300 - 500 K [522]) and even exhibits a negative expansion at the conditions where the phase 

transformations occur [523]. As shown in Table 1.5.5, the relative expansivity for two various samples of 

CaTiO3-? tested under analogous conditions differs by 10 - 20% [524-526].

Introducing Ln cations into Sr1-xLnxTiO3-? under oxidizing conditions results in formation of ordered 

intergrowths rather than in generation of Ti3+ cations. In this respect, the expansion behavior of doped 

titanates is less obvious in comparison with the perovskites enriched with easily reducible cations. For 

example, no obvious compositional dependence of the thermally-induced strains was detected for Sr1-

xLaxTiO3-? series [105]. Generation of A-site cation vacancies basically results in lower TECs [420, 527] due 

to hindered oxygen losses or suppressed formation of RP-phases (Table 1.5.5). 

On the other hand, a decrease in TEC on Ln doping is well pronounced for transition metal-

substituted titanates, where the electronic compensation of the variations in cation composition may be 

realized [501]. Introduction of reducible cations generally increases the thermally-induced strains; such a 

behavior is consistent with lower TECs of Ti-substituted ferrites, manganites, cobaltites, etc. and is primarily 

associated with the contribution of the oxygen losses into the overall dimensional changes [438, 501, 528]. 

Larger ionic radius of Ti3+ compared with that of Ti4+ (0.67 vs 0.605 Å in 6-fold coordination [133]) 

is expected to enlarge the cell volume with oxygen losses on reduction. Indeed, an enhancement of the cell 

parameters of the perovskite phase upon reduction has been observed on numerous titanate-based 



87 

 

compositions [16, 377, 414, 422]. On the other hand, similar to manganite perovskites, formation of cation 

vacancies induced by oxidation may generate additional unit cells with resultant increasing of the total 

volume [529, 533]. Furthermore, the thermomechanical behavior of ATiO3-?-based systems is in most cases 

interfered by slow equilibration, formation or dissolution of secondary phases on redox cycling, while 

accumulation of stresses in the perovskite lattice may provoke formation and propagation of cracks. These 

factors lead to large discrepancies between the experimental results which obscure the comparison of the 

literature data. Therefore, no unambiguous correlation between the defect equilibria and chemical expansion 

behavior has been found [70, 527, 529, 533]. 

For pre-oxidized samples, the volume changes generally occur towards a slight expansion on 

decreasing p(O2) due to an enlargement of Ti cations upon reduction, although densification of initially 

porous specimens as well as kinetics or secondary phase-related factors may result in a slight shrinkage, as 

shown in Table 1.5.6. The linear expansivity of air-sintered (Sr,Ln)TiO3-? on reduction is generally within 

0.02 - 0.03% [105, 527, 529], while the presence of reducible cations basically induces more substantial 

dimensional variations [16, 531]; in the latter case, the thermomechanical behaviour is determined by the 

reducibility of the corresponding cations.

On the other hand, preliminary generation of a large quantity of oxygen vacancies achieved at 

elevated temperatures under low p(O2) conditions and subsequent oxidation of the perovskite induces a 

dramatic enhancement of the dimensions which may amount to 0.1 - 0.5% in the linear scale. The origins of 



88 

 

such a behaviour may be complex and are associated with a slow re-distribution of the defects in the 

perovskite structure which may delay from fast p(O2) variations, cracking or contribution of secondary 

phases/ordered domains at high p(O2) into the volume changes. In accordance with large variations in the 

oxygen nonstoichiometry, pre-reduced titanates doped with donor-like Ln or Nb cations show larger volume 

changes, at least in terms of the cell parameters [407, 464, 529]. 

As discussed in previous sections, a preliminary step of high-temperature reduction is generally 

required in order to improve the transport and electrocatalytic properties of titanates. Therefore, any 

oxidation of preliminary reduced anode material should be avoided; in particular, p(O2) changes in the range 

~10-16 - 10-10 atm induce ~0.5% linear strain of pre-reduced Sr0.7La0.3TiO3-?, unacceptable for the 

electrochemical applications [533]. 

 
 

1.5.6. Electrochemical properties 

 
Analogously with other perovskite-based anodes, the electrochemical performance of titanates is 

strongly influenced by preparation and testing conditions. Apart from the common origins of the 

discrepancies, for the present system the behavior is complicated by the slow equilibration kinetics, and a 

comparison of results obtained for different titanate-based anodes in various studies is in most cases 

unreasonable. 

Selected results on the electrochemical behaviour of titanate-based anodes and related composites 

are shown in Figs. 1.5.10 - 1.5.12 and Table 1.5.7. Despite the high electronic conductivity of ATiO3-?-based 

perovskites under low-p(O2) conditions (above 100 - 1000 S/cm) reported in numerous studies [13, 105, 406, 

460], most titanate anodes are coated with Pt, Au or other metallic paste. Comparing the level of the 

polarization resistances obtained for the covered anodes with a few data for uncoated ones, one may conclude 

that such a modification indeed results in a strong improvement of the electrochemical performance, 

primarily due to a promotion of elementary steps involved in the oxidation process [7, 388, 416, 536].

Fig. 1.5.11. Polarization resistance of selected titanate-based composite anodes deposited onto YSZ 

electrolyte 
 

 

As a confirmation of the small effect of the electronic conductivity on the electrochemical 

performance, highly-conductive donor-doped titanates show extremely poor performances [215, 411, 537], in 

accordance with lowering the oxygen ionic conduction on increasing dopant amount [407, 450, 501]. 

Moreover, the characteristics of such electrodes are strongly related with the conditions of the electrode 

processing. In particular, individual anodes Sr0.94Ti0.9Nb0.1O3-? deposited onto YSZ and covered with Pt paste, 

showed polarization resistance in the range 0.5 - 160 Ohm×cm2 at 1123 K, depending on the sequence of 

reduction or oxidation runs [411, 538]. 

The anode characteristics can be improved by fabrication of composite anodes (Fig. 1.5.11, Table 

1.5.7). For example, the anode Sr0.88Y0.08TiO3-? - Ce0.5La0.5O2-? (50 - 50 wt.%) deposited onto LSGM 

electrolyte with Ce0.5La0.5O2-? buffer layer showed the power density in dry H2 at 1123 K as high as 450 

mW/cm2, which might be enhanced up to 1000 mW/cm2 by Pd impregnation into the anode, in accordance 

with improved catalytic activity [539]. Composite anodes (Sr,La)TiO3-? - YSZ (50-50 wt.%) covered with Au 

paste rendered the polarization resistances in the range 0.9 - 1.3 and 2.0 - 2.5 Ohm×cm2 at 1173 K in wet H2 

and CH4, respectively. Power densities observable on cells with the corresponding anodes were as high as 

100 - 120 mW/cm2 at 1173 K with pure hydrogen as fuel; the major performance losses were associated with 

a large electrolyte thickness (2 mm). Although the results obtained for anode compositions with various 

doping level were scattered, somewhat better results were obtained for 25 - 29% of La [416]. This amount of 

donor atoms was shown to be acceptable to ensure a high level of the electronic conduction, while further La-

doping might induce formation of ordered domains and hamper the ionic conduction. 



91 

 

Nevertheless, most studies have been carried out with derivatives of Sr0.67La0.33TiO3-?, containing a 

larger amount of donor cations (Figs. 1.5.11 - 1.5.12). Such a choice was related with the necessity to 

suppress the decrease in the concentration of n-type charge carriers induced by introduction of acceptor 

cations; on the other hand, the presence of low-valent cations ensured a better structural tolerance towards La 

introduction and provided an enhanced level of the ionic conduction. Quite promising results were obtained 

for Mn-doped Sr0.67La0.33TiO3-?-based anodes, yielding the polarization resistance as low as 0.45 and 1.2 

Ohm×cm2 at 1173 K in wet H2 and wet CH4 fuels, although the information on the anode processing is scarce 

[12]. Partial replacement of Mn with Ga enables to achieve the R? of 0.2 Ohm×cm
2 in wet H2 at 1173 K. 

Maintaining the anode in hydrogen resulted in a gradual improvement of the performance [540, 541].

Fig. 1.5.12. Polarization curves of selected titanate-based anodes 
 
 
A positive impact of Fe-doping into Sr0.67La0.33TiO3-? on the anode characteristics has been reported 

[542, 543]; the optimum performance was found for ~50% of Fe. The polarization resistance of composite 

anodes varied in the range 1 - 2 Ohm×cm2 at 1173 K in wet hydrogen; more promising results were obtained 

for Sr0.92Y0.08Ti0.75Fe0.25O3-?-based anodes (0.7 Ohm×cm
2 at 1073 K) [528]. Acceptable electrode activity was 

achieved upon doping with Sc [447], Co [536], Ni [544], consistently with larger amount of oxygen 

vacancies, higher ionic conductivity and/or catalytic activity towards fuel oxidation processes. Introduction 

of Cr possessing a low catalytic activity caused large polarization resistances [163, 212, 538] (Fig. 1.5.12). 

In accordance with transport and thermomechanical properties, the electrochemical activity of 

titanate anodes may be improved by preliminary high-temperature reduction [13, 105, 464]. Unfortunately, 

no literature data on comparative behaviour of preliminary reduced vs. oxidized anode layers are available, 



92 

 

primarily due to peculiarities of the procedure of the cell preparation and operation. In this respect, one may 

note studies on cone-shaped Sr0.94Ti0.9Nb0.1O3-? anode on polarization cycling, where preliminary cathodic 

polarization accelerates the subsequent electrode processes and reduce the polarization resistance [411]. 

Similar to the transport and thermomechanical behaviour, most titanate-based electrodes showed a specific 

feature, associated with fast and in some cases irreversible performance deterioration observable on 

oxidation. For example, the composite anode Sr0.94Ti0.9Nb0.1O3-? - YSZ showed a 2-fold increase in the 

polarization resistance after exposures to high p(O2) and subsequent switch to H2 [411]. Sr0.895Y0.07TiO3-? - 

YSZ - Ni anode showed a satisfactory tolerance towards cycling between H2, N2 and air at 1073 K, while a 

similar procedure at 973 K induced a 35% loss in the power density after 200 cycles [452]. On the other 

hand, Ni-cermet anode with Sr0.8La0.2TiO3-?-based support was shown to be capable to endure at least 5 

cycles dry H2 - air, without degradation of the performance; considering a poor tolerance of Ni-based anodes 

towards oxidation, the presence of titanate layer seems beneficial [545]. 

Titanate-based electrodes are characterized by a satisfactory chemical compatibility with YSZ 

electrolyte, although the stability may be deteriorated by Ti diffusion into the electrolyte. No reaction 

products between (Sr,Ln)TiO3-? and YSZ could be observed up to 1623 - 1823 K [247, 377, 416, 537]. The 

presence of transition metal cations, such as Fe, in the perovskite structure significantly affects the 

compatibility [501, 528, 531]: in particular, interaction of SrTi1-xFexO3-? with YSZ was detected at 

temperatures above 1273 K, irrespective to Ti:Fe ratio [501]. On the other hand, the interaction may be 

suppressed by appropriate doping with Ln cations or introduction of A-site cation vacancies [407, 420, 501]. 

In contrast, studies by Burnat et al. showed a worse compatibility of Sr0.7La0.2TiO3-? in comparison with the 

stoichiometric analogue [546]. Incorporation of Ti into the zirconia lattice is detrimental for the ionic 

transport ([89, 103] and references cited) which necessitates a search of the optimum cation ratio in the 

perovskite composition in order to expand the temperature range acceptable for the electrode preparation. 

Promising results were obtained for Sr0.94Ti0.9Nb0.1O3-?, chemically compatible with YSZ in air and 9% H2 - 

Ar at 1523 K [411]. No secondary phase formation between Sr0.7La0.2TiO3-? in contact with CGO10 was 

detected at 1573 - 1673 K [546].  

Summarizing the behaviour of titanate-based electrodes, one may note that addition of titanates in 

appropriate proportions to ionic conducting and/or catalytically active components significantly widens the 

applicability of the related electrochemical cells. The main concern, however, remains the low tolerance 

towards oxidizing atmospheres leading to strong and irreversible changes in the anode microstructure, 

degradation of the functional characteristics of the electrode constituents, etc.  

 
 
1.6. Molybdate-based double perovskites as alternative anode materials 

 
Considering the stability under reducing conditions, the choice of potential anode materials may be 

extended to other perovskite-related structural groups. A remarkable success in terms of electrochemical 

applications has been achieved with doped molybdates A2(Mo,B)2O6-? (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, B = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, 

Ni) ordered in B-sublattice due to large differences between the charges and/or sizes of molybdenum and 



93 

 

substituent cation. Formation of oxygen-deficient perovskite-like structure becomes possible due to 

coexistence of highly-valent Mo species ensuring the conservation of oxygen sublattice and the cations in 

low oxidation states capable to adopt multiple oxygen coordination which stabilizes oxygen vacancies. The 

ability of Mo to accept electrons and form low-coordinated molybdyl ions is also beneficial for providing the 

electronic and ionic conductivity [1, 129, 551]. Reasonable activity of Mo-containing compounds towards 

reforming processes [552-554] is expected to promote the performance of molybdate anodes in natural fuels.

Synthesis of Sr2MgMoO6-? is generally accompanied by formation of small amounts of alkali-earth 

carbonates and SrMoO4; the quantity of the impurities increases in air or in diluted CH4 atmospheres [555, 

556]. The presence of the secondary phases is undesirable for the electrochemical applications and 

preliminary reduction step is required in order to achieve an acceptable electronic conductivity. Selected 

functional properties of molybdate-based double perovskites are shown in Table 6.1. The conductivity of the 

double perovskite Sr2MgMoO6-? and its derivatives after reduction varies in the range 5 - 10 S/cm which is 

close to the limit acceptable for anode applications, while the material shows reasonable chemical and 

structural stability and tolerance of the functional characteristics towards moderate oxidation [129, 556, 557].  



94 

 

Pre-reduction of Sr2MgMoO6-? and subsequent annealing in air during the process of the preparation 

of electrode layers enables to obtain anodes with promising level of the electrochemical activity [126, 129]; 

in particular, the polarization resistances in the range 0.2 - 1 Ohm×cm2 were observed, as shown in Table 6.2.  

The power density of cells with Sr2MgMoO6-? anode (coated with Pt paste) and LSGM electrolyte of 300 µ m 

of the thickness separated with CeO2-based sublayer achieves 840 mW/cm
2 at 1073 K in dry H2 [126]. The 

performance remains on a constant level on introduction of 5 ppm H2S and shows only a 2.5% drop after 50 

cycles (Fig. 6.1). An advantage of molybdate-based anodes is high performance in hydrocarbon fuels 

amounting to 440 and 350 mW/cm2 at 1073 K in dry CH4 and 97% CH4 - 3% H2O, respectively [126, 129]. 

An improvement of the performance with La doping up to 40% was reported, possibly due to generation of 

additional n-type charge carriers [557]. The power density drop after 50 operation cycles in CH4-containing 

fuel achieves 10 - 15% [126, 557]. 

Application of Sr2MgMoO6-?-based materials imposes stringent requirements on the operation 

conditions, primarily due to formation of SrMoO4 on oxidation. On the other hand, reduction at temperatures 

above 1173 K is accompanied by decomposition into Sr3Mo2O7-based phase, MgO and Mo [555]. High 

content of alkali-earth cations in both sublattices makes the material susceptible towards the presence of H2O, 

CO2, SOx in fuel atmosphere, while the presence of molybdenum induces volatilization or surface-diffusion 

phenomena ([14, 80, 266] and references cited). Another concern relates to insufficient chemical 

compatibility of Sr2MgMoO6-? with solid electrolytes which necessitates introducing buffer layers [129, 556].

The double perovskite structure enables a partial or complete substitution of Mg in B-sublattice with 

transition metal cations generating Mo6+/5+ and B3+/2+ redox couples. In particular, for A2FeMoO6-? double 

perovskites, decreasing A-site cation radius promotes delocalization of electrons in 2p, 3d and 4d bands of 

oxygen, iron and molybdenum. This, in particular, leads to increasing conductivity in the order Ba2FeMoO6-

?&lt;Sr2FeMoO6-?&lt;Ca2FeMoO6-? and transition from small polaron to metallic-type behavior [560]. 

On the other hand, the degree of the ordering and the stability is lower for smaller A-site cations; for 

example, Ca2FeMoO6-? synthesized in H2 - Ar atmospheres shows a substantial decomposition into the 

brownmillerite phase and CaMoO4 on placing into N2 environments [560]. Introduction of transition metal 

cations other than Fe into B-sublattice was shown to be less beneficial, primarily due to poor stability. In 

particular, Sr2CoMoO6-? and Sr2NiMoO6-? showed decomposition in 5% H2 - Ar at 1073 K [562], although 

the formation of metallic phases might promote the oxidation processes. 

A promising electrode activity was found for Sr2FeMoO6-?-based anodes, due to the optimum 

combination of oxygen vacancy concentration, stability and expansion behaviour. In particular, the power 

density of dry H2-fuelled cell achieved 830 mW/cm
2 at 1123 K, exhibiting the drop of 2.7% per 20 hours 

(Fig. 6.1). In commercial city gas contaminated with H2S, the power density shows a decrease per initial 3 



96 

 

hours of operation down to 436 mW/cm2 at 1073 K followed by stable working, without detectable carbon or 

sulfur deposition [560]. Nevertheless, the overall performance of Sr2FeMoO6-? anodes is inferior in 

comparison with Mg-substituted analogue. 

 

1.7. Final remarks. 

 

In accordance with literature data on alternative anode materials, most studies have been focused on 

titanates, chromites and manganites. Briefly, their potential for electrochemical applications may be 

summarized as follows.  

Titanates. ATiO3-?-based compositions offer a high level of the electronic conductivity at low p(O2), 

moderate thermal expansion, stability in reducing atmospheres, contribution of the ionic transfer, chemical 

compatibility with solid electrolytes, while titanate-based anodes showed a tolerance towards hydrocarbons 

or S-containing gas species. However, the optimum properties of most titanates can only be achieved after 

preliminary high-temperature reduction which complicates the procedure of the cell preparation. From this 

viewpoint, an oxidation often leads to drastic and irreversible chemical or structural transformations with 

resultant deterioration of mechanical and transport characteristics. Similar features are relevant to other n-

type conductors, such as vanadates, niobates, molybdates, etc. 

Chromites. LnCrO3-? and their derivatives are notable due to their high stability in a wide p(O2) 

range, reasonable thermal and chemical expansion, suppressed reactivity with commonly used solid 

electrolytes. The perovskite structure enables to accommodate a wide range of dopants which allows to tune 

the functional properties. On the other hand, the low p(O2) drop of the conductivity makes the issue of the 

electronic transfer critical for electrochemical applications, while the low level of oxygen transport and 

catalytic activity necessitates introduction of additional components into the anode. The volatility of Cr-

containing species and the tendency towards formation of secondary phases on the surface impose stringent 

requirements on the gas atmosphere composition and the cell processing conditions. 

Manganites. Manganite perovskites possess a high level of the electronic conductivity, which can be 

kinetically conserved even under anodic conditions, especially if the composition is stabilized with an 

appropriate dopant. Most authors report an enhanced ionic transport and catalytic activity towards oxidation 

processes. However, the formation of secondary phases and the conductivity drop under low p(O2) 

deteriorates the electrode performance which, in particular, induces degradation of the long-term 

performance. Manganites exhibit enhanced chemically-induced expansion or contraction; the 

thermomechanical behaviour is complicated by formation/consumption of cation and oxygen vacancies for 

the same composition in a wide p(O2) region. Moreover, high cation diffusivity affects the sintering 

behaviour which may cause microstructural problems for the electrode layers. High mobility of Mn and 

reduced stability of the perovskite phase promote the interaction/interdiffusion phenomena at the interface 

electrode/electrolyte. Similar peculiarities are typical for Fe- or Co-enriched perovskites. 

As shown by the examples, no alternative anode composition has been elaborated so far capable to 

compete with conventional Ni cermets. On the other hand, an appropriate combination of the positive 

characteristics relevant to the groups presented may offer a possibility to achieve satisfactory electrode 



97 

 

performance and stability. To some extent, such an approach has been realized by preparation of 

compositions at the joints between the groups i.e. (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Cr,Ni)O3-

?, (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-?, etc. However, the relationships between chemical composition, functional 

characteristics and anode properties for most materials are unclear, while promising results have been 

essentially obtained on composite electrodes, in particular those modified by distribution of metallic phase 

over the anode layer. With this respect, it would be attractive to reveal the intrinsic properties of the 

perovskite phases responsible for the polarization behaviour of the corresponding electrodes. The present 

study will thus evaluate selected derivatives of chromites, manganites as well as complex compositions like 

(La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? and (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? in terms of the structural, microstructural, transport and 

thermomechanical characteristics as well as their electrode activity.

Synthesis and ceramic processing 

 

The conditions of the material processing as well as starting chemicals are listed in Table 2.1. 

Powders Zr0.85Y0.15O2-? (8YSZ), Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-? (CGO20) and (La0.9Sr0.1)0.98Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-? (LSGM) were 

supplied by Tosoh and Praxair. Synthesis of nano-sized CGO20 was carried out by cellulose-precursor 

technique; the details can be found in [567]. 

Most compositions were prepared by the glycine-nitrate process (GNP), a self-sustaining 

combustion technique which enables to produce submicron-sized homogeneous powder with a large surface 

area. The method is essentially preferable when the solid state synthesis is stagnated due to kinetic reasons. 

This technique was employed for the synthesis of perovskite-type (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Cr1-xTixO3-? (x = 0 - 0.5), 

(La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? (x = 0.15 - 0.75, y = 0 - 0.05), (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? and 

(La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? (x = 0.3 - 0.4). The stoichiometric amounts of the corresponding precursors 

indicated in Table 2.1 were dissolved in distilled water followed by addition of 1.5-fold excess of glycine. 

Insoluble TiO2 was added to the aqueous mixture of other precursors. Irrespective of the initial products, the 

aqueous mixture was placed into a beaker with the volume of 1 - 2 L, covered with a steel grid and 

evaporated on a hotplate until autoignition. The resultant foam-like powders were annealed at 1073 - 1273 K 

for 2 hours to remove organic impurities. Due to low homogeneity of Ti-containing materials, additional 

annealing steps at 1473 - 1573 K with intermediate regrinding in a planetry ball-mill with zirconia balls were 

performed. The series (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? (y = 0 - 0.03) was synthesized using GNP technique in the 

Institute of Solid State Chemistry, Chernogolovka, Russia, by A.I. Ivanov and Dr. S.I. Bredikhin. 

Synthesis of SrMn1-xNbxO3-?, CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? and La10Si5AlO26.5 was carried out by a standard 

ceramic technique. The stoichiometric quantities of precursors indicated in Table 2.1 were mixed, placed into 

alundum crucibles and heated up to 1073 - 1273 K. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was ground in a ball-

mill and subjected to 3 - 5 additional annealing steps in 1073 - 1573 K temperature range, with 5 - 20 hours 

dwell at the target temperature. The processing of LSGM and La10Si5AlO26.5 solid electrolytes is described in 

Table 2.2. 

The powders obtained by the techniques described were uniaxially pressed into discs (12 - 20 mm in 

diameter) of various thicknesses. The pellets were sintered in air under conditions indicated in Table 2.1. 

Heating and cooling was carried out with the rate 2 - 5 K/min, in order to approach to the complete 

equilibrium with the gas atmosphere. In order to access possible effects of the microstructure on the ionic 

transport properties, samples of (La0.35Sr0.65)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.1Ti0.4O3-? were synthesized for 15 or 50 hours. 

Ceramic pellets for oxygen permeability measurements were subjected to gas-tightness test. This 

procedure involved attaching a disc-shaped sample preliminary polished to the necessary thickness to a 

lateral side of 8YSZ tube (13 mm of outer diameter) with glue (Super Cola 3). After drying the glue, the 

pellet was immersed into water and the inner volume of the tube was exposed to the pressure of ~2 atm. The 

quality of the ceramics was checked visually by the absence/presence of air bubbles on the outer surface of 

the pellet.

X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Mossbauer spectroscopy studies were 

carried out on powders obtained by grinding the sintered ceramics. Optionally, the powders were additionally 

annealed at 1273 - 1573 K prior to the analysis in order to release gaseous species adsorbed from ambient 

atmosphere. For dilatometric tests and conductivity or Seebeck coefficient measurements, bar-shaped 

specimens were cut from the pellets using a cut-off machine (Struers) and polished to obtain cuboid-like 

samples which might be placed and equilibrated on either facet on a flat surface. 

 

X-ray diffraction, Mossbauer spectroscopy 

 

Phase relationships in intermediate and final products were studied using XRD analysis carried out 

on powdered samples. XRD patterns were collected in atmospheric air on a series Rigaku D/Max-B X-ray 

powder diffractometer. The scans were obtained in Cu-K? radiation (?=0.154178 nm), within 2? range 10 - 

80º. The patterns were collected with scanning rate 3º /min or with 0.02º step with exposition time of 1 - 2 

seconds. 

In order to evaluate phase changes occurring in the materials upon temperature variations, ceramic 

samples were quenched from the given temperature into liquid nitrogen. Selected compositions were 

annealed in Ar or in wet 10% H2 - N2 flow with subsequent slow cooling (2K/min) or quenching in the 

corresponding gas flow. The oxygen partial pressure in the gas atmosphere was controlled using an oxygen 

sensor placed into the same or a separated furnace. In the latter case, the sensor was connected to the reaction 

compartment with gas communication systems, while the values of p(O2) around the sample were calculated 

from the sensor response corrected for the temperature difference between the corresponding furnaces. 

Variations in the crystal structure on heating in situ were examined using high-temperature XRD 

technique. The measurements, carried out at the North Carolina A&amp;amp;T State University by Dr. S.N. 

Yarmolenko, were performed with AXS-Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer with Cu K? X-ray radiation 

source and Eurlean cradle. Parallel beam optics was used to minimize errors associated with sample 

displacement and surface roughness. Anton Paar H-900 high temperature stage mounted on XYZ-positioning 

stage was used for measurements at temperatures up to 1173 K. Ceramic samples were polished down to 0.5 

mm thick tablet form for better contact with heater. HTXRD scans were performed in the interval 2? of 20 - 



101 

 

80º with speed 5s/point and step 0.01º. Calculation of the cell parameters of single- or multiple-phase 

compositions as well as verification of the lattice symmetry was performed using the Fullprof software [568]. 

Mossbauer transmission studies were carried out in collaboration with Dr. J.C.B. Waerenborgh and 

Dr. E.V. Tsipis at the Centro de Ciências e Tecnologias Nucleares, Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade 

de Lisboa. The spectra were acquired at room temperature and 4 K using a conventional constant-

acceleration spectrometer and a 25 mCi 57Co source in Rh matrix. ?-Fe foil was selected for velocity 

calibration. The adsorbers were obtained by pressing the powdered samples into perspex holders. Isomer 

shifts are related to metallic ?-Fe at room temperature. The 4 K spectra were collected using a JANIS bath 

cryostat (SVT-400), with the sample immersed into liquid He. The spectra were fitted to Lorentzian lines 

using a non-linear least-squares method [569]. The relative areas and line widths of both peaks in a 

quadropole doublet and one of the symmetrical peaks constituting a magnetic sextet were constrained to 

remain equal. The distribution of magnetic splittings was fitted with the histogram method [570]. 

 

Microstructural analysis 

 

The microstructural studies of ceramic and powdered samples as well as inspection of the electrode 

layers were performed by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive spectroscopy 

(SEM/EDS) on microscopes Hitachi S4100 (Rontec UHV detector, electron beam voltage 25 kV) and SU-70 

EDS (Everhart Thornly Secondary Electron Detectors, accelerating voltage 0.5 - 30 kV). Examination of 

ceramic materials was carried out on fractured or polished surface; in the latter case, mechanical polishing 

was performed using silicon carbide papers #600-2400 supplied by Struers coated with a small amount of 

diamond paste ¼ - 9 mkm (Cafro), sequentially decreasing the abrasive roughness. Afterwards, the samples 

were ultrasonically cleaned in ethanol or acetone and thermally etched for 0.1 - 1 hour in order to remove the 

organic residues and to visualize the grains. The annealing temperature was selected as 150 - 200 K below 

the sintering temperature. Obtained ceramics was attached to the sample holder using carbon cement (Gocke) 

or carbon tape (NEM TAPE). In order to avoid surface charging during microscopic analysis, the samples 

were covered with a thin layer of carbon using evaporating machine EMITECH K950X. 

To observe possible microstructural or compositional changes taking place in the electrode layers 

during the electrochemical tests, the half-cells subjected to the polarization measurements or duplicates 

prepared by the corresponding procedure and exposed to the same environments as the cells for the 

electrochemical studies were attached to the holder by such a manner so as to keep the electrode layer on the 

top. Another approach involved breaking the half-cell across the electrode and electrolyte layers, 

perpendicular to the interface, and exposure of the fractured surfaces and the boundary between the half-cell 

components to the microscopic studies. The latter method allowed to examine the morphology of the 

electrode layer and detect possible interactions, cation interdiffusion, etc. 

TEM analysis was carried out at the University of Aveiro under the supervision of Dr. A.L.B. Lopes 

with a Hitachi H-9000 microscope (electron beam energy 300 kV). Additional experiments were made at the 

North Carolina A&amp;amp;T State University by Dr. S.N. Yarmolenko using the microscope Hitachi-H600AB (100 

kEv). The procedure of preparation of submicron powdered samples involved their deposition onto copper or 



102 

 

carbon grid holders from ultrasonically-dispersed suspension in ethanol followed by drying and deposition of 

carbon. The microstructural studies were combined with EDS analysis to control the elemental composition 

of the regions examined. 

 

Thermal analysis 

 

Dilatometric studies were performed on rectangular bar samples in a vertical dilatometer Linseis 

L75/N1. Calibration of the dilatometer was carried out on Al2O3 bar subjected to the same measurement 

procedure as the samples studied. Depending on the gas atmosphere and kinetics of equilibration of the 

material, the data were collected in two regimes. The 1st included continuous heating up to 1373 K and 

immediate cooling with the rate of 3 K/min down to the ambient temperature; such a procedure was 

essentially employed during measurements in flowing air. The 2nd approach involved heating (3 K/min) up to 

1243 - 1273 K, maintenance at the upper  temperature for 2 - 70 hours, with consecutive cooling (2 K/min) 

and measurements under isothermal conditions in the temperature range 973 - 1273 K with the step of 50 K. 

Basically, the collection of data on each temperature continued until the complete equilibration; for selected 

compositions in the series (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? the stable length could not be attained during a reasonable time 

period, and the isothermal tests were restricted by 20 - 40 hours. The thermal expansion coefficients and 

chemically-induced isothermal expansion were evaluated in the flow of air, Ar or CO-CO2; the latter mixture 

was formed by preliminary passing CO2 through an electrochemical oxygen pump where oxygen was 

evacuated from the gas mixture under fixed current of 300 mA. The oxygen partial pressure was controlled 

by an oxygen sensor located on the exit from the dilatometer. The isothermal chemical expansion in the 

corresponding atmosphere with respect to air at a given temperature T was calculated as

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a Setaram SetSys 16/18 instruments in a flow 

of air, Ar or 10% H2 - N2 mixture dried with silicagel prior to entering the measuring chamber. Since 

complete reduction of the materials studied into compositions with a certain stoichiometry could not be 

achieved under the experimental conditions, the obtained data were analyzed using relative mass changes 

upon thermal or redox cycling with respect to 573 K in air or, in the case of isothermal measurement, with 

respect to the mass in air under given temperature. For evaluation of the kinetics of oxygen exchange, 

transient studies were carried out under isothermal conditions by sequential replacement of air atmosphere by 

Ar and 10% H2 - N2 until the equilibration and in the reverse order. Al2O3 powder was used as the reference 

sample for the calibration of the equipment.

Total conductivity and Seebeck coefficient measurements 

 

The total conductivity of bar-shaped ceramic specimens was measured by 4-probe DC technique. A 

scheme of the samples for the conductivity and Seebeck coefficient measurements as functions of p(O2) and 

temperature is shown in Fig. 2.1. Optionally, in order to ensure a better contact between Pt leads and the 

sample, the surface region where the contact takes place was preliminary coated with Pt paste (supplied by 

Heraeus or GEM). For measurements of the conductivity in air, the current leads were pressed to the lateral 

facets of the bar, in order to provide more uniform current flow through the sample. The activation energy Ea 

of the total conductivity ? was evaluated using the standard Arrhenius equation:

  (Eq. 2.2) 

 
where A0 is the pre-exponential factor, T is the temperature, R is the gas constant. 

The cell for isothermal measurements of the total conductivity and Seebeck coefficient consists of 

an electrochemical oxygen pump and sensor (Fig. 2.2) isolated with a glass sealant layer which suppresses a 

direct impact of current flux through the pump on the signal from the sensor originating from distribution of 

the current within YSZ. For the thermoelectric power measurements, the sample was fixed between two B-

type thermocouples (Fig. 2.1) one end of each also served as a potential probe for measuring thermal e.m.f. 

of the sample.

The thermopower was determined under a temperature gradient of 15 - 20 K; the higher potential 

was formally assigned to a hotter end of the sample. Prior to the tests, the cell was evacuated with a vacuum 

pump and filled with O2 - CO2 mixture. In the process of measurements, the p(O2) required was adjusted by 

electrochemical pumping of oxygen in/out of the cell and controlled by the sensor. The studies were 

performed in 973 - 1223 K. After each reduction run, selected points were re-collected on oxidation in order 

to control possible structural transitions, phase decomposition or ceramics failure. The equilibration criteria 

of the sample after a change in either p(O2) or temperature included the relaxation rates of the conductivity 

and thermopower less than 0.05%/min and 0.001 µ V/K×min, respectively. Due to stagnated gas diffusion 

and compositional instabilities at p(O2) in the range 10
-11 - 10-6 atm, and resultant hysteresis phenomena, the 

data in this region were basically excluded from consideration. 

The measured values of the total conductivity and Seebeck coefficient were used for calculation of 

the concentration of charge carries and their mobility. For the materials with predominant p-type electronic 

transport, the Seebeck coefficient ? is related with the charge carrier concentration p using the Heikes 

formula [21, 166]

where N is the number of states, k is Boltzmann constant, e is the elementary charge and ? in Eq. (2.4) is a

The hole mobility (µp) was evaluated from the conductivity data as

where Nfu is the number of formula units per unit cell, Vuc is the unit-cell volume, and p is calculated from 

Eqs. (2.3) - (2.4) and is related to formula unit. In the case when the exact value of the number of states N 

cannot be determined, the analysis is carried out operating with the values (p/N) and (µp×N) which are 

calculated from Eqs. (2.3) - (2.5). 

 

Determination of oxygen permeation fluxes, bulk oxygen tracer diffusion and surface exchange 

coefficients 

 

The oxygen transport-related parameters were determined only for gas-tight ceramics. The oxygen 

permeability (OP) through a ceramic membrane is associated with simultaneous migration of oxide ions and 

electrons induced by a gradient of oxygen chemical/electrochemical potential at the membrane surfaces. 



105 

 

Under the absence of external electrical current, the oxygen flux j through a dense mixed conductor of the 

thickness L, placed under the oxygen chemical potential gradient, is given by [571, 572]:

of surface kinetics-related limitations, one should introduce the value of specific oxygen permeability J(O2)

with p1 and p2 corresponding to oxygen partial pressures at the membrane permeate and feed sides, 

respectively. In the case of fast exchange kinetics at the membrane/gas interfaces, the value J(O2) should be 

thickness-independent, while the permeation flux is expected to be proportional to reciprocal thickness. 

When the oxygen transport is determined exceptionally by the rates of the surface processes, the permeation 

flux is thickness-independent, while the specific permeability linearly increases with the membrane 

thickness. 

The experimental cell for electrochemical measurements of OP is schematically illustrated in Fig. 

2.3. The cell consists of an electrochemical oxygen pump and a sensor made of 8YSZ. The contacts between 

the Pt leads and zirconia surface were ensured by multiple coating and firing Pt paste. In order to eliminate 

any direct influence of current through the pump on the sensor, an additional zirconia ring was introduced 

between the electrochemical parts and fixed with glass-ceramic sealant (Tseal = 1440 - 1450 K). After sealing 

the ceramic membrane of the material studied (Tseal = 1360 - 1380 K), a series of direct currents Ipump was 

passed through the pump in the direction of elimination of oxygen out of the cell, corresponding to the 

permeation fluxes in accordance with

An alternative technique of OP measurements involved placing the membrane studied under the 

gradient of flowing air vs. H2 - H2O - N2 gradient. The variations of the oxygen content in the gas atmosphere 

at the permeate side were evaluated using electrochemical oxygen sensors at the inlet and outlet of the 

corresponding compartment of the cell. The measurements were carried out by Dr. A.A. Yaremchenko, the 

details of the method and calculations can be found elsewhere [574].

The bulk oxygen tracer diffusion (D*) and surface exchange (k) coefficients were assessed using the 
18O/16O isotopic exchange depth profile method carried out in the Institute of Solid State Physics, 

Chernogolovka, Russia, by Dr. S.I. Bredikhin and Yu.S. Fedotov. Prior to 18O/16O exchange annealing, the 

polished and cleaned ceramic samples were equilibrated in air of normal isotopic abundance.  Afterwards, 

the chamber was evacuated and labeled oxygen (95 % enriched 18O2) was introduced to reach p(O2) = 0.2 

atm. The samples were annealed at 1023 -1223 K for 1 - 45.5 hours followed by quenching. The 18O 

penetration profiles were determined by time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) using a 

TOF-SIMS.5-100P instrument (ION-TOF GmbH, Germany) operated in the depth profile mode, with a 45° 

incidence 25 keV Bi+ primary ion beam and 45° incidence 2 keV Cs+ sputter ion beam. The crater depth was 

measured after the SIMS analysis by surface profilometry (Taylor–Hobson Talystep). An example of 18O 

penetration profile obtained for La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? is shown in Fig. 2.4.

The rate of isotopic exchange across the gas/solid interface is assumed to be directly proportional to

Preparation of the electrode layers and polarization measurements 

 

Polarization measuremets were performed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy using 3-

electrode configuration. The cell geometry is shown in Fig. 2.5.; such a location of the counter (CE) and 

reference electrodes (RE) was selected in accordance with [576, 577]. The tests were carried out on cells 

composed of perovskite, perovskite-based composite or cermet electrodes. Gas-tight pellets LSGM or 

La10Si5AlO26.5 of 16 - 18 mm diameter and 1.5 - 2.0 mm thickness were used as solid electrolytes. The 

conditions of the fabrication of the cells with perovskite-based anode and cathodes are listed in Table 2.3. 

Basically, the deposition of the woring electrode (WE) layers (diameter 5.0 - 6.0 mm) involved preparation 

of ethanol-based suspension of the material studied followed by paint-brushing the layer onto the substrate 

with subsequent firing in air. Optionally, a layer of submicron CGO20 powder mixed with 2 wt.% 

Co(NO3)2×4H2O in ethanol was preliminary applied onto the electrolyte to achieve the surface density of 3 - 

5 mg/cm2 followed by firing at 1473 K in air and subsequent deposition of the electrode layer.

Due to strong sinterability of (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? powder, the corresponding electrode 

layers were prepared using various procedures, presented in Table 2.4. All the cells consisted of a LSGM 

electrolyte preliminary coated with CGO20 sublayer. In order to achieve the optimum adherence of the 

electrode layer with simultaneous maintainance of the porosity and large surface area, the modification routes 

involved tuning the electrode firing temperature, grinding and preliminary annealing.

Powder mixtures consisting of a metal (Cu, Ni, Ag) and solid oxide with high oxygen ionic

impregnation of one of the phases into the anode layer. The composite powders were mixed with ethanol and 

applied onto the electrolyte surface using paint-brush technique; the electrode composition and details of the 

fabrication procedure are listed in Table 2.5. Optionally, a layer of metallic silver was deposited onto the 

electrolyte surface prior to the electrode application; the corresponding procedure is described in Table 2.6.

The CE was applied on the opposite side of the electrolyte membrane symmetrically with respect to 

the WE. The RE (0.9 - 1.3 mm of diameter) was placed on the distance of 7.0 - 9.0 mm from the nearest edge 

of the WE; both CE and RE were prepared by coating a thin layer of Pt paste (Heraeus) subsequently fired at 

1203 - 1373 K. In order to ensure appropriate current collection, Pt gauze was pressed to the WE and CE. 

The point contact with the RE was provided by pressing the tip of a thick wire (0.5 mm of diameter). No 

coverage of the WE with Pt or other metal paste was carried out in order to avoid an interference of 

additional catalytic effects on the electrochemical properties. 



111 

 

The equipment for electrochemical measurements in reductive atmospheres is shown in Fig. 2.6. 

The cell was placed onto a tip of an alumina tube (14.5 mm of inner diameter), simultaneously ensuring the 

contacts between the electrodes and the current collectors, while the lateral surface of the electrolyte was 

covered with a thick layer of ethanol-based suspension of sealing glass powder (Tseal = 1173 - 1223 K). Prior 

to the measurements, the WE and CE compartments were flushed with humidified 10% H2 - N2 (50 ml/min) 

and air (12.5 ml/min), respectively. The composition of the gas fluxes was settled with Bronkhorst mass-flow 

controllers and controlled by oxygen sensors. For evaluation of cathode performance, a simplified setup was 

used, without oxygen sensors and necessity for gas separation. 

The electrochemical tests were carried out in galvanostatic mode using Autolab PGSTAT302 

Equipment. The impedance data between the WE and RE were recorded in the frequency range from 1 MHz 

to 1 mHz; the amplitude of the alternating current varied in the range 0.5 - 2.0 mA. The overpotential (?) was 

calculated as 

 

? = U - IROhm  (Eq. 2.14) 

 

where U is the potential difference between the WE and RE, I is the current flowing between WE and CE, 

and IROhm is the ohmic contribution into the total potential drop. In order to estimate the electrode 

polarization resistance the values of the corresponding ohmic resistance ROhm were extracted from impedance 

spectra. The ohmic and polarization resistances were evaluated from the intersection of the high- or low-

frequency arcs with the axis Z’ in accordance with Fig. 2.7:

Selected electrode layers after electrochemical tests were surface-modified by addition of ethanol-

based saturated solutions of catalytically-active components (Ce(NO3)3 and Ni(NO3)2 for anodes and 

Pr(NO3)3 for cathodes) and the measurements repeated. The decomposition of nitrates proceeded during the 

heating the system up to the temperature of studies. The cells after the tests as well as as-prepared analogues 

were subjected to microscopic analysis in order to reveal possible microstructural changes, phase interaction 

etc.

Chapter 3. Pseudobinary (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? - SrTiO3-? system and alternative 

LaCrO3-?-based materials 

 

Chromite perovskites represent a wide group of alternative anode materials possessing high redox 

stability and acceptable thermomechanical behaviour, while the transport and electrochemical properties may 

be optimized by an appropriate cation doping [8, 9, 15, 18, 113, 210, 212]. On the other hand, partial or 

complete replacement of Cr cations is desirable for high-temperature applications, in order to avoid the 

formation of volatile chromium oxides, hydroxides and other compounds containing high-valent Cr species 

or to suppress the reactivity with other cell components [44, 82, 139, 142, 285]. In accordance with numerous 

reports, the systems (La,A)CrO3-?, (La,A)MnO3-? and (La,A)TiO3-? exhibit an unlimited mutual solubility 

provided that B-site doping is accompanied by appropriate variations of the cation ratio in A-sublattice [16, 

131, 155-159, 164, 168, 171, 352], while cation modifications in B-sublattice may ensure a promising 

combination of the functional characteristics such as the tolerance towards a wide range of operation 

conditions, electronic and ionic transport, thermomechanical properties and catalytic activity [8, 10, 16, 212]. 

The present section is devoted to studying phase and structural stability, thermal and chemical expansion, 

mixed electronic and ionic conduction of (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? and applicability of the title 

materials for anode or cathode utilizations. 

Doping LaCrO3-based compositions with Fe is considered as another approach to reduce the 

polarization resistance of chromite-based anode layers. However, the literature data on the phase and 

structural behaviour upon redox cycling, oxidation state of the constituent transition metal cations as well as 

transport mechanism in Fe-doped chromites are contradictive [9, 17, 44, 178, 179, 191, 206, 212]. The 

electrode performance of (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-? has been reported to be somewhat lower or comparable to that of 

(La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? analogues [9, 212, 264], but Fe-doped compositions exhibited an enhanced reactivity 

with gallate-based electrolytes [9] leading to higher ohmic losses and raising the problem of the long-term 

stability. This drawback can be to some extent avoided by applying buffer layers between the components of 

the electrochemical cell. Moreover, the insufficient chemical stability and enhanced chemical expansion may 

cause long-term degradation of (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-? anodes. In order to clarify the effect of Fe-doping into 

chromites, the following part concerns functional characteristics of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? (x = 0.3, 0.4) 

perovskites and polarization behaviour of the corresponding anodes in contact with LSGM electrolyte with 

CGO20 sublayer. 

In recent years, much attention has been drawn to a strategy of segregation from the perovskite 

structure of catalytically active phases, in particular highly dispersed metallic particles [15, 17, 184, 186, 188, 

215, 544]. The presence of metal droplets with a large surface area has been reported to accelerate the 

elementary steps related to gas/solid interface and allow to catalyze the oxidation processes [15, 186, 211, 

544]. Cation-stoichiometric perovskites may be thermodynamically intolerant towards simultaneous lowering 

the amount of B-site cations and oxygen atoms in anionic sublattice leading to separation of lantanide- or 

alkali-earth metal-enriched secondary phases upon reduction [15, 135]. This issue can be partially resolved 

by introduction of cation vacancies into A-sublattice. On the other hand, generation of substantial amounts of 



114 
 

the metallic phase and their subsequent agglomeration may lead to performance instability of the anode 

layers, and the control of the concentration of dopant cations and reduction process is required. The final part 

of the present chapter is addressed to appraisal of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? perovskites as cathode 

and anode materials for IT-SOFCs. The presence of Mg is expected to ensure a contribution of the ionic 

transport and surface exchange into the overall electrode mechanism. Furthermore, even if a slight excess of 

B-cations in the perovskite causes separation (Mg,Ni)O secondary phase, its presence might promote the 

formation of dispersed Ni particles upon reduction [578, 579].

purity of (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? and (La,Sr)(Cr,Ti)O3-? materials in a wide compositional 

range [16, 155, 164, 352]. Selected XRD patterns are presented in Fig. 3.1. The perovskite-type crystal 

structure of the title compositions was identified as rhombohedrally-distorted (S.G. 3R c ), analogously with 

parent (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? and selected representatives of Mn-doped titanates [10, 16, 488]. Table 

3.1. lists the unit cell parameters in hexagonal settings and abbreviations used below. The unit cell volume 

tends to slightly increase with increasing x, as expected from the cation radius variations.

Reducing p(O2) down to 10
-18 atm does not lead to perovskite decomposition, except for the 

segregation of minor amounts of MnO. Note that MnO segregation on reduction is typical for most 

manganite-based compositions even if those are stabilized by B-site doping, as shown in Table 1.3.1. 

(La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? and (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? perovskites have been reported to show a transition from the 

rhombohedral structure into the cubic or orthorhombic symmetry on reduction [16, 113, 177]. No 

transformations were observed for (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-?, although more accurate structural 

analysis is required to refine the crystal symmetry. 

Typical microstructures of (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? dense ceramics are illustrated in Fig. 

3.2. SEM inspection of the ceramic materials showed traces of glassy phases at the grain boundaries, 

suggesting a liquid phase-assisted sintering process. At the same time, no compositional inhomogeneities 

were revealed by EDS, within the limit of experimental uncertainty. Introduction of Sr and Ti into the 

perovskite seems to cause a slight enlargement of the grains, although at high doping levels the effect is less 

obvious. The ceramics contained no open pores; the density of the ceramic materials was higher than 95%.

3.1.2. Thermal expansion 

 

The results of dilatometric measurements are summarized in Figs. 3.3 - 3.4 and Tables 3.2 - 3.5. The 

average linear thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) of (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? vary in the 

range (10.8 - 14.5)×10-6 K-1, similar to the other chromite- and manganite-based materials, as shown in 

Tables 1.2.2. and 1.3.3. Careful examination of the thermal expansion data shows that the TECs tend to a 

modest increase with strontium and titanium additions. An increase of the TEC with alkali-earth metal 

content is typical for perovskites [112, 131, 143, 329], while introduction of reasonable amounts of Ti into 

chromites and manganites is known to suppress the expansion [16, 131, 156, 163, 231].

As shown by TGA results (inset in Fig. 3.3), the compositional and temperature trends in TECs 

correlate with oxygen nonstoichiometry variations, and may be tentatively attributed to decreasing average 

oxidation state of manganese cations. In particular, all the compositions showed a gradual increase in TECs 

at elevated temperatures, consistently with the chemical contribution into the overall expansion. At the same 

time, the oxygen losses on heating in air are minor (???0.002) even for (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-?, and the 

increase in TEC values with temperature and x observable in Fig. 3.3 and Table 3.2 results primarily from 

shifting redox equilibria in the perovskite lattice. Namely, co-doping with Sr2+ and Ti4+ or increasing the 

temperature seems to promote disproportionation of manganese: 



118 
 

2Mn3+ ? Mn4+ + Mn2+  (Eq. 3.1) 
 

The process leads to raising the concentration of p-type electronic change carriers and facilitates 

oxygen losses on heating. Moreover, in accordance with ionic radii of Mn2+, Mn3+, Mn4+ (0.83 Å, 0.645 Å, 

0.53 Å, respectively, suggesting the octahedral coordination and high-spin state of the cations [133]), the 

disproportionation of Mn3+ should indeed result in an overall enlargement of the cation sizes. On the other 

hand, Mn4/3+ and Cr4+/3+ species should be interrelated by redox equilibrium 

 

 Cr4+ + Mn3+ ? Mn4+ + Cr3+  (Eq. 3.2) 
 
and the concentration of the chromium and manganese species is also affected by temperature or the doping 

degree. The contribution of both processes into the thermal expansion behavior is consistent with chemically-

induced expansivity and with the variations of electronic conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, discussed in 

following sections. 

Analyzing the dependence of TECs on p(O2), one may observe that reduction of 

(La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? leads to a decrease of the thermal expansivity (Table 3.3). On the other hand, 

simultaneous introduction of Sr and Ti gradually reverses this trend; such a behaviour is in accordance with 

decreasing the chemical expansivity on heating or cooling (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? and 

(La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-?, respectively, as demonstrated below.

Taking into account that the oxygen loss/uptake upon thermal cycling in air increases with Sr and Ti 

content (the inset in Fig. 3.3), the latter trend might indicate enhanced oxygen nonstoichiometry variations 

under reducing conditions for Sr, Ti-enriched compositions or shifting the redox equilibrium between Cr4+/3+ 

and Mn4+/3+ couples on temperature or p(O2) variations as well as upon cation doping. Another possibility 

might relate to a minor mechanical failure of (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? on reduction; such a phenomenon 

has been observed on related compounds [16, 105, 317]. One should note that a slight lowering of TECs at 

lower p(O2) is typical for chromite perovskites (Table 3.3) which are characterized by an obvious correlation 

between the oxygen stoichiometry variations and dimensional changes. 

 

3.1.3. Chemical expansion 

 

As for the parent material, (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? [10], the chemically-induced expansion of 

Ti-substituted compositions on decreasing p(O2) down to 6×10
-4 atm is negligible, lower than 0.03% (Fig. 3.4 

and Table 3.4). In reducing atmospheres, the lattice expansion increases and achieves almost 0.6% with 

respect to the atmospheric oxygen pressure (Table 3.5).

Fig. 3.4. Temperature dependencies of the relative 
length changes of LSMCT3 (A) and LSMCT5 (B) 
ceramics in air, Ar and CO-CO2 atmospheres 

 

In accordance with the model described in Chapter 1.2.4, the p(O2)-induced dimensional changes of 

perovskite-type materials containing transition metal cations are primarily associated with variations of their 

oxidation state and ionic radii [193, 196, 234, 236]. The level of the chemical strains indicated in Table 3.5 is 

close to that observable for La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.5Al0.5O3±? and La0.4Sr0.6Mn0.6Ti0.4O3±? perovskites (0.6 - 0.7% upon 

reduction from air into H2 - H2O - Ar atmosphere). Taking into account the high and close Mn concentration 

in the perovskites indicated and in (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? as well as comparatively facilitated 

reducibility of Mn4+ species, one may suggest that the redox couple Mn4+/3+ is primarily responsible for the 

dimension behaviour observed. In particular, extensive oxygen losses on reduction and contribution of the 

processes described by Eqs. (3.1), (3.2) is confirmed by trends in the total conductivity and Seebeck 

coefficient with p(O2), in particular, by the conductivity drop at low oxygen pressures, shown in following 

sections. Again, the chemically induced expansion of (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? increases with 

increasing x, thus confirming that Sr and Ti co-doping promotes oxygen losses and shifts redox equilibria 

between Mn4+/3+/2+ and Cr4+/3+ cations. 

Irrespective to the compositional trends, the overall level of the thermal and chemical expansion 

observed in the wide range of conditions is moderate. This makes it possible to use the title materials in 

contact with solid oxide electrolytes, such as stabilized zirconia, CeO2-based compositions, LSGM or 

La10Si5AlO26.5 [30, 227, 580, 581]. Nonetheless, one should still be cautious concerning the strains at 

elevated temperatures necessary to fabricate electrochemical cells. For example, cooling 

(La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? from 1373 to 973 K in air leads to the contraction within ?T ? -0.54%. If 



121 
 

assuming that a relatively thin layer of solid electrolyte with a TEC of 11.1×10?6 K?1 is fired onto a thick 

(La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? substrate, reaching an unstrained condition at 1373 K in air, the expected strain 

difference after cooling down to 973 K is in the order of ?? ? 0.10%. The compressive stresses imposed on 

the thin solid-electrolyte layer can then be estimated as ?C ? ??E/(1-?) ? -179MPa, using typical values of the 

elastic constants E = 125 GPa and ? ? 0.3 known for LSGM at 973 K [582]. These low and compressive 

stresses should be acceptable for applications of the electrochemical cells. However, the thermal and 

chemical strain components of (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? almost compensate each other under reducing 

conditions, for instance, (?T+?C) ? -0.02% at 973 K and p(O2) = 10
-19 atm. Under these conditions, the strain 

difference between the layers becomes ?? ? -0.44%, imposing excessive tensile stresses on the thin 

electrolyte layer (for the above-quoted elastic constants, ?C ? 786 MPa). On the other hand, actual stresses 

may be significantly lowered when one of the contacting layers is very porous, as for the deposition of a thin 

porous electrode onto a thicker solid electrolyte support. In the latter case, the stresses under reducing 

conditions revert from tensile to compressive, thus providing better thermomechanical stability. 

 

3.1.4. Total conductivity 

 

The conductivity in (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? is predominantly electronic; the oxygen 

permeation data presented below show that the oxygen-ionic contribution is lower that 10-3 %. Fig. 3.5 

displays the temperature dependencies of total conductivity (?) of the ceramic materials studied at 

atmospheric p(O2). In air, the conductivity has a thermally-activated character; the activation energies Ea, 

calculated in accordance with Eq. (2.2), vary within 16 - 30 kJ/mol at 943 - 1263 K (Table 3.6), decreasing 

on Sr and Ti co-doping.

Introduction of Sr into LaCrO3-? or LaMnO3-? is known to promote the electronic transport and 

reduce the activation energy [121, 131, 143]. Moreover, SrTiO3-? and SrMnO3-?-based compositions exhibit 

broadband conduction mechanism in reductive atmospheres [320, 381, 457, 583], and the reduction of the 

activation energies might be associated with partial transition in the transport mechanism and corresponding 

trends in the electronic charge carrier mobility. In turn, temperature dependencies of the charge-carrier 

concentration should be governed by two factors having opposite effects, namely thermal excitation and 

increasing oxygen deficiency when temperature increases. 

The oxygen partial pressure dependencies of the electrical properties (Figs. 3.6 - 3.7) exhibit a series 

of specific features typical for LaMnO3- and LaCrO3-based solid solutions [184, 214, 226, 323]. First of all, 

both the Seebeck coefficient (?) and conductivity are essentially p(O2)-independent in oxidizing and 

moderately reducing environments, indicating that the oxygen stoichiometry changes are minor. Increasing x 

lowers the thermopower down to negative values at x &gt; 0.2. This trend is not surprising taking into account 

that strontium titanate exhibits n-type electronic transport. However, reducing oxygen pressure below a 

certain level, marked as “1” in Fig. 3.6B, gives rise to increasing oxygen deficiency, resulting in increasing 

Seebeck coefficient and decreasing conductivity. This type of behavior observed for all compositions 

provides an argument in favor of dominant p-type electronic transport, despite the negative ? values for Sr- 

and Ti-rich materials.

In oxidizing and mildly reducing atmospheres the Seebeck coefficients increase with temperature for 

the compositions with x = 0 - 0.2, but exhibit a slight opposite tendency when x increases up to 0.4 - 0.5. A 

possible origin of the thermopower variations in (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-?, associated with shifting the 

redox equilibrium between Cr and Mn cations towards formation of Mn4+ and Cr3+ species on heating (Eqs. 

(3.1), (3.2)) and site-exclusion effects around Cr4+ cations, was suggested in [10]. In the case of (La0.75-

xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? (x = 0.4 - 0.5), all titanium cations under oxidizing conditions are expected to 

have constant oxidation state, 4+; the site-exclusion phenomena near Ti4+, if any, should remain essentially 

unchanged with increasing temperature. Since the oxygen stoichiometry variations with temperature are 

much smaller than might be expected from the thermopower changes, the decrease in Seebeck coefficient 

originates from thermal excitation of p-type electronic charge carriers in accordance with the Heikes formula 

[26, 166]. The parameters (p/N) and (µp×N) characterizing the population of the electron holes and their 

mobility were calculated from the data on the conductivity and Seebeck coefficient using Eqs. (2.3) and 

(2.5); the estimates are shown in Fig. 3.8 - 3.9.

For all the materials studied, the hole mobility is temperature-activated. This makes it possible to 

conclude that the small-polaron mechanism is dominant, irrespective of the progressive decrease in the 

mobility activation energy indicating an increasing role of the broad-band mechanism on doping. In the case 

of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-?, the (p/N) ratio decreases with increasing temperature as the equilibrium 

between the B-site cations (Eq. (3.2)) shifts towards Mn4+ formation and the site-blocking effects near Cr4+ 

disappear [10]; (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? exhibit a modest, but clearly visible opposite trend (Fig. 3.9). If 

considering the stable oxidation state of Ti4+ under oxidizing conditions, rising (p/N) with temperature 

provides an evidence for progressive Mn3+ disproportionation, leading to Mn4+ and Mn2+ formation (Eq. 

(3.1)). The increasing Mn4+ concentration is responsible for higher oxygen losses and for the larger chemical 

and thermal expansion observed for Ti- and Sr-rich compositions. The variations in Seebeck coefficient, 

which becomes negative on co-doping, originate primarily from increasing Mn4+ concentration; the 

occupancy of manganese sites available for hole hopping in (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? under oxidizing 

conditions is higher than 50%. The latter factor contributes also to the relatively low hole mobility which 

decreases on Ti and Sr co-doping, mainly due to blocking of electronic transfer by the stable Ti4+ cations. 

Comparison of the oxygen pressures corresponding to the onset of large oxygen losses (point “1” in 

Fig. 3.6) with the low-p(O2) stability limits of Cr-, Mn- and Ti-containing oxide phases [26, 39, 46], as 

shown in Fig. 3.10, suggests that these phenomena are mainly associated with reduction of manganese 

cations rather than with phase decomposition, in agreement with XRD (Fig. 3.1).

Notice also that the corresponding p(O2) values are essentially independent of x in (La0.75-

xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-?, indicating that the electronic transport processes and oxygen deficiency 

variations are determined by the B sites occupied by manganese, whereas Cr and Ti cations form a redox-

stable matrix. Another possibility of the comparable level of the decomposition limits might relate to two 

opposite effects of Sr and Ti introduction on the stability, with resultant mutual compensation. 

At oxygen partial pressures below approximately 10-13 atm, the slope of the ? vs. p(O2) curves 

decreases (Fig. 3.6A); the Seebeck coefficient of Ti-rich compositions exhibits a maximum and a minimum 

marked in Fig. 3.6B as “2” and “3”, respectively. Most likely, these regimes are associated with rising 

contributions of the Mn3+/2+ and Ti4+/3+ redox couples. One should note that the low-p(O2) process (point “3”) 

is characterized by substantially lower enthalpy in comparison with those occurring in the perovskites studied 

at higher oxygen pressures (points “1” and “2”), decomposition of Mn3O4 or LaMnO3-? as well as formation 

of oxygen vacancies in TiO2-?. However, due to phase transitions typical for (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr)O3-? perovskites 

on reduction [8, 113] and segregation of MnO traces (Fig. 3.1), quantitative analysis of the electrical 

properties in this p(O2) range is problematic. Whatever the microscopic mechanisms, co-doping with Sr and 

Ti leads to lower conductivity under reducing conditions; this should further increase the role of electronic 

transport as the electrode performance-limiting factor, characteristic of parent (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? 

[10]. Consequently, the electrochemical activity of (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? in reductive 

atmospheres is expected to be lower for Sr- and Ti-enriched compositions.

3.1.5. Oxygen permeability 

 

Despite the small differences in the oxygen stoichiometry at elevated temperatures (the inset in Fig. 

3.3), the steady-state oxygen permeation fluxes (j) through dense (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? 

membranes under a fixed oxygen pressure gradient are quite similar for all the compositions (Fig. 3.11). The 

activation energies of the permeation fluxes calculated analogously with those of the total conductivity (Eq. 

2.2) are also essentially composition-independent and vary in the range 150 - 200 kJ/mol (Table 3.7), close to 

the corresponding values of oxygen diffusion or ionic conductivity in chromite or manganite-based 

perovskites [10, 187, 305, 320].

The similarity between the fluxes suggests that the overall rate of oxygen transport is essentially 

determined by similar mechanisms, which are not directly related to the intrinsic factors, such as the oxygen 

vacancy concentration in the bulk or metal-oxygen bonding strength dependent of the cation composition. 

The likely limiting factors include, in particular, surface exchange kinetics and oxygen diffusion 

along the grain boundaries. In order to validate the latter assumption, effects of the grain size on the steady-

state oxygen permeation were assessed for (La0.35Sr0.65)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.1Ti0.4O3-? ceramics sintered during 15 and 

50 h (Fig. 3.12); the relevant microstructures are compared in Fig. 3.13.

The results show that decreasing grain-boundary area causes a significant decrease in the oxygen 

fluxes, whilst the apparent activation energy remains essentially unchanged. The changes in the permeation 

fluxes are substantially larger than the level of experimental uncertainties, and are well reproducible for the 

membranes with different thicknesses. The latter observation is illustrated by Fig. 3.12 (B and D), which 

compares the values of specific oxygen permeability J(O2), calculated in accordance with Eq. (2.7). It should 

also be mentioned that significant grain-boundary contributions to the oxygen ion diffusion are known for 

LaCrO3-, LaMnO3- and especially SrTiO3-based materials with low oxygen nonstoichiometry [112, 254, 336, 

339, 371, 512]. The microstructural features associated with liquid phase-assisted sintering were reported to 

promote fast ionic conduction along the boundaries [44]. 

Further inspection of the results shown in Fig. 3.12 shows also a non-negligible role of the surface 

exchange kinetics. The specific oxygen permeability is proportional to (j×d) and should be thickness-

independent when the exchange processes are fast enough [10, 320]. For (La0.35Sr0.65)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.1Ti0.4O3-? 

membranes, increasing the thickness leads to lower oxygen fluxes and higher J(O2) values due to a 

decreasing role of the interfacial exchange. This complex mechanism makes it impossible to evaluate relative 

contributions of the grain bulk, grain boundaries and surface-related processes to the overall membrane 

resistance to oxygen transfer. The oxygem ionic conductivity evaluated using the approach described in 

Chapter 2 (Eq. 2.11) is as low as (1 - 5)×10-4 S/cm at 1223 - 1273 K which is more than 10 times higher as 

compared with that for La0.87Sr0.13Cr1.03O3-õ [198]. Nevertheless, this level of the ionic diffusion is still 

insufficient to expect any considerable enhancement in the electrochemical reaction zone due to oxygen 

transport through electrode bulk, as for (La,Sr)MnO3-based cathodes [324, 584]. 

 

3.1.6. Redox kinetics 

 

The low values of the permeation fluxes through (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? ceramics and 

resultant large errors in their determination do not allow to make an unambiguous conclusion about the effect 

of Sr and Ti content on the parameters responsible for the oxygen transport in the perovskites. At the same 

time, knowledge of the relationships between the composition and transport characteristics is desirable with 

respect to selection of the optimum composition for the electrochemical applications. In order to compare the 

rates of the surface exchange processes, mass relaxation studies were carried out on La0.75Sr0.25Mn0.5Cr0.5O3-? 

and La0.25Sr0.75Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? powders under isothermal conditions; an example of the transient behaviour is 

shown in Fig. 3.14. Both powders were produced by mechanical grinding ceramic samples which should 

produce the powders with comparable surface area. 

The redox kinetics was evaluated from TGA data collected on sequential switches of the atmosphere 

in the order air - Ar - 10% H2 - N2 - Ar - air, in accordance with the model

where m, t, and ? are the mass, time and relaxation time constant, respectively. Note that the right term, 

exp(?t/?), is common for the description of non-steady-state diffusion and exchange processes and originates 

from solving the temporal part of the second Fick’s law by separation of variables. An exact agreement with 

Eq. (3.3) corresponds to dominating surface limitations, whereas the solutions for open and partly open 

boundaries (relatively fast surface exchange) may be represented by a series of exponential terms exp(?t/?i) 

with ?i calculated from the boundary conditions and transport coefficients [575].

powders on reduction after switching the atmosphere from Ar to 
10% H2 - N2 at 1073 K (A) and reduction kinetics analysis (B) 

 

The similarity between the surface exchange parameters is consistent with a close level of the 

permeation fluxes exhibited by the perovskites with various Sr and Ti amounts (Fig. 3.11) assuming that the 

overall kinetics of oxygen permeability is strongly influenced by the surface-related processes. Since the bulk 

ionic transport in (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? is rather slow, the low-p(O2) electrochemical activity 

should primarily be related with the electronic conductivity of the materials under anodic conditions. 

 

3.1.7. Electrochemical behavior: general trends 

 

Fig. 3.16 shows typical anodic polarization curves obtained on porous (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-

xTixO3-?-based layers in H2 - H2O - N2 atmosphere. The results demonstrated a good reproducibility for 

different series of the samples, as shown in the inset. No substantial alterations in the electrochemical 

behavior were also observed after the current cycling and temperature variations in the range 873 - 1073 K; 

SEM inspections revealed no significant microstructural degradation after the measurements, both in air and 

in reducing atmospheres (Fig. 3.17). 

In general, increasing x in (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? system deteriorates the anode 

performance. This trend correlates with the data on the electrical conductivity in the high-temperature range 

(Fig. 3.6), indicating that the electrode reaction rate under reducing conditions is strongly affected by the 

electronic transport. The anodes in contact with La10Si5AlO26.5 showed higher overpotentials and a stronger 

tendency to limiting currents. The relationships between the functional characteristics of the anode and 

electrolyte and electrode performance as well as approaches towards optimizing the electrochemical activity 

of anodes are considered in Chapter 5.

Under oxidizing conditions the conductivity of (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? is reasonable 

for the electrochemical utilizations and the electrode performance becomes nearly composition-independent 

(Fig. 3.18); the polarization curves of as-prepared porous layers follow Tafel-type dependencies. In this 

situation, the processes at the electrolyte / electrode and electrolyte / gas interfaces are expected to become 

critical for the overall electrode reaction rate. Similar to the anodes exposed to reducing atmospheres, the

performance of (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? based cathodes is generally significantly better in 

contact with LSGM solid electrolyte compared to La10Si5AlO26.5, in correlation with the oxygen-ionic and 

electronic conductivities of these electrolyte materials.

Under anodic polarization in air, the influence of solid electrolyte composition becomes less 

pronounced. The trends under cathodic or anodic currents may partly originate from the incorporation of 

variable-valence cations into the electrolyte surface during electrode preparation [10, 218]. Anodic 

polarization raises the oxygen chemical potentials both in the electrode and in the interfacial electrolyte 

layers, locally increasing the concentration of oxygen species and oxidation state of the variable-valence 

cations. For the oxygen-hyperstoichiometric silicates where the ionic transport is dominated by interstitial 

anions [21-24, 585], the interfacial processes related to the oxygen transfer and diffusion should hence be 

facilitated under anodic polarization and hampered due to cathodic reduction. 



134 
 

Irrespective of the electrolyte composition, the anodic performance of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? 

and (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? in air is significantly higher compared to cathodic (Fig. 3.19). This 

difference might be attributed to an enrichment of the electrolyte surface with transition metal cations 

oxidized under anodic currents and resultant increasing p-type electronic conduction or catalytic activity at 

the electrode/electrolyte interface. In accordance with previous studies, a slight dissolution of transition metal 

cations in the electrolyte lattice in the region close to the electrolyte/electrode or electrolyte/gas interface has 

a positive impact on the performance. In particular, the exchange currents for Au cathodes applied onto YSZ 

preliminary coated with Fe2O3 were 2 - 3 orders lower in comparison with a similar cathode deposited onto 

pure YSZ electrolyte. The effect of iron penetration into the electrolyte was primarily associated with an 

enhancement of the exchange currents, without variations in the slope of Tafel plots, indicating that the 

overall mechanism has not been affected by Fe dissolution in the fluorite lattice [586]. Similarly, an 

activating effect was observed on incorporation of Ce, Mn, Pr, Co into YSZ or Cr, Mn, Ba into LSGM ([584, 

587, 588] and references cited). 

The mechanism of the improvement is, however, unclear and hardly might be attributed to only 

electronic conductivity. Although doping of zirconia-based compositions with Mn or Fe indeed increases the 

electronic contribution, the overall level of the electronic transport still remains rather low to ensure a 

sufficient current collection [351, 589, 590]. At the same time, isotope exchange studies on Au-coated 

zirconia showed that the effect of the transition metals in the fluorite lattice relates primarily to catalytic 

promotion of the oxidation processes; namely, to stabilization of oxygen species adsorbed at Au/YSZ 

interface [586]. Whatever the particular mechanism of the promotion of the cathodic processes over the 

electrolyte surface, in the present work a participation of transition metal cations dissolved in the solid 

electrolyte seems responsible for improved activity under anodic currents. The latter suggestion is, in 

particular, confirmed by the effect of protective ceria-based layers on the electrode behaviour, as discussed in 

following sections. 

Similar to most oxide electrodes [10, 266, 591], the overpotentials of (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-

xTixO3-? cathode layers can be drastically decreased by the infiltration of praseodymia, a result of enhanced 

exchange currents at both electrode/gas and electrolyte/gas interfaces. Nevertheless, the electrochemical 

activity of porous (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? layers in air remains low even after the surface-

modification; for example, the cathodic overpotential of (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? - PrOx cathode on 

LSGM at current density of -80 mA/cm2 and 1073 K is as high as -190 mV. 

In summary, the results show that co-doping of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? by Sr
2+ and Ti4+ makes 

it possible to decrease chromium content without essential deteriorating effects on the transport properties 

and electrode performance under oxidizing conditions. The moderate increase of the thermal and chemical 

expansion, governed by the manganese cations in the B sublattice, may be suppressed by optimizing the 

acceptor/donor concentration ratio. The same factor, and minor additions of other transition metal cations 

might be used to increase electronic conductivity and electrochemical activity of the porous SOFC cathodes. 

However, aliovalent doping with acceptor- and donor-type cations may hardly be expected to suppress the 

conductivity drop at low p(O2), which is critical for the anode performance and makes it necessary to 

incorporate electronically-conducting components in the porous anodes.

3.2. Functional properties of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? perovskites 

3.2.1. Phase and structural behaviour on redox cycling 

 

Studying the functional properities of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? perovkites was carried out in 

framework of collaborative work with collegues from the Department of Materials and Ceramic 

Engineering/CICECO, University of Aveiro, and the Nuclear and Technological Institute (presently IST/ITN, 

Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade Técnica de Lisboa), involving Dr. M.F. Lue, Dr. E.V. Tsipis, Dr. 

J.C. Waerenborgh and Dr. A.A. Yaremchenko. 

As shown in Fig. 3.20, (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? (x = 0.3 - 0.4) powders and ceramics prepared in 

air are single phase perovskites with rhombohedrally-distorted lattice (S.G.: 3R c ); the unit cell parameters 

are listed in Table. 3.8. Note that reducing Sr content and increasing Fe amount in (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-? is 

known to promote the stabilization of the orthorhombic structure [9, 176, 178]; in particular, rhombohedral 

symmetry has earlier been reported for LaSr2(Fe,Cr)O8+? [179], whereas La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Fe0.5O3 is 

orthorhombic [178].

Compared to the latter compound, the higher symmetry of oxidized (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? 

originates from higher concentration of Cr3+/Cr4+ cations having smaller radii with respect to Fe3+/Fe4+ [133], 

thus increasing the perovskite tolerance factor. Moreover, in accordance with the data on electronic transport 

and Mössbauer spectra discussed below, the average oxidation state of chromium cations is higher than that 

of iron, again decreasing the average size of B-site cations in the perovskite structure. 

In accordance with literature data [178, 191, 212], (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-? are capable to accommodate 

up to ~25 and 50% Sr and Fe, respectively, with preservation of the single phase down to reduced oxygen 

pressures. Since the phase boundaries of the perovskites with the compositions similar to those studied in the 

present section are located close to the anodic conditions, a discrepancy between the reported data on the 

stability are observed, due to minor differences between the experimental conditions, hindered decomposition 

kinetics or various sensitivity of the experimental techniques. Selected reports on the stability of iron-doped 

chromites are summarized in Table 3.9.

No traces of metallic iron or other secondary phases were detected after annealing at 1223 K in wet 

10% H2 - N2 flow in the present work, in agreement with Mössbauer spectroscopy. This confirms phase 

stability of the title perovskites in a wide p(O2) range necessary for the SOFC anode applications. However, 

the structure of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? under low-p(O2) conditions was identified as orthorhombic (S.G.: 

Pbnm) originating from an enlargement of Cr cations upon reduction which lowers the symmetry. 

The Mossbauer spectra collected on samples equilibrated under ambient conditions (Fig. 3.21, Table 

3.10) show that Fe is present in the perovskite essentially in +3 state and is octahedrally-coordinated with 

oxygen. This necessitates generation of Cr4+ for charge compensation, while the oxygen content under 

oxidizing conditions is close to the stoichiometric value, in accordance with TGA studies and the behaviour 

of Seebeck coefficients with temperature and p(O2) discussed in the following sections. 

One should note that previous reports on the preferential location of electron holes in 

(La,A)(Cr,Fe)O3-?-based perovskites are contradictive. In particular, X-ray photoelectron srectroscopy (XPS) 

studies showed that iron cations in LaCr0.9Fe0.1O3-? and La0.7Ca0.3Cr0.9Fe0.1O3-? remain essentially in +3 state, 

analogously to Fe2O3 [17, 206]. On the other hand, the data on oxygen nonstoichimetry variations with p(O2) 

and temperature were analyzed assuming the constant oxidation state of chromium (+3) and 

disproportionation of Fe3+ species [191]. Electronic transport behaviour of La0.33Sr0.67Cr1-xFexO3-? exhibited 

features typical to ferrite-based perovskites [179], where multiple oxidation states of Fe may coexist in a 

wide p(O2) range [114], although the behaviour of chromites with lower Fe content might be quite different.

Analysis of the data on Mössbauer spectroscopy of La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.2Fe0.8O3-? revealed ~97% of Fe
3+, 

while further doping with Sr increases the fraction of iron cations in higher oxidation states [592]. It should 

be noticed that similar discrepancies between the literature data with respect to the oxidation states of 

transition metal cations were found for Mn- or Co-doped chromites [10, 113, 164-167, 170]. Regardless of 

the possibility of Fe3+ cations to accept additional holes, most authors report that the average oxidation state 

of Cr species exceeds that of Fe [17, 131, 206, 592], consistently with the current results. 

Upon reduction iron cations maintain the state +3, but the formation of oxygen vacancies induces 

lowering the coordination of Fe3+ down to pentahedral. Fig. 3.22 shows changes of oxygen deficiency on 

reduction in a dry 10% H2 - 90% N2 flow, calculated from the TGA results, with respect to the stoichiometry 

in atmospheric air. The latter reference point was selected as no complete reduction into phase mixtures with 

definite oxidation states of iron and chromium cations was achieved during TGA experiments up to 1373 K. 

Although reduction leads to large nonstoichiometry values, the overall level of oxygen deficiency 

can still be tolerated by the perovskite lattice. Taking into account that iron cations are trivalent, and 

assuming ? ? 0  in air for the sake of comparison, the estimated average oxidation state of chromium in dry 

10% H2 - 90% N2 tends to asymptotically approach +3.10 for x = 0.3 and +3.01 for x = 0.4 at 1223 K. At 

1073 K, these values are +3.16 and +3.14, respectively. Consequently, one may conclude that the redox 

behaviour and electronic conductivity of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? should be primarily governed by Cr
3+/4+ 

states in the entire p(O2) range relevant for the electrode applications. 

Despite higher reducibility of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? with enhanced iron content (Fig. 3.22), the 

Mössbauer spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analyses showed no evidence of phase decomposition in 

mildly reducing atmospheres. In particular, no traces of metallic iron were detected in the Mössbauer spectra 

after reduction at 1223 K and p(O2) = 10
-18 atm, consistently with XRD results. Taking into account that the 

low-p(O2) stability limits of iron-containing phases usually exhibit van’t Hoff type dependencies on 

reciprocal temperature [25, 41, 46, 48], an acceptable thermodynamic stability under anodic conditions in the 

intermediate-temperature SOFCs can be expected. Nonetheless, long-term testing is necessary to access 

reducibility in pure H2 at 770 - 970 K, since the low-p(O2) decomposition of transition metal-substituted 

chromites may be hindered kinetically [8, 10, 17, 171].

The data on Mossbauer spectroscopy allow to assess a possibility of formation of ordered structures. 

For hypothetical (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? where all B-site cations are trivalent, the oxygen vacancy 

concentration should correspond to approximately 0.19 sites per formula unit (? ? 0.19). Assuming a random 

distribution of the vacancies, approximately 28% penta- and 5% tetra-coordinated B-sites might be predicted 

from geometrical consideration. The estimated fractions of penta-coordinated Fe3+ are, however, substantially 

higher (Table 3.10), thus indicating a greater energetic favourability for vacancy location near Fe3+ in 

comparison with Cr3+. Moreover, the calculated concentration of penta-coordinated Fe3+, 0.21 - 0.23 

cations/f.u., is almost independent of x and is close to the vacancy concentration. As the oxygen 

nonstoichiometry is low and statistical distribution of Cr/Fe cations in the B sublattice was confirmed by 

Rietveld refinement of the XRD data, the absence of tetrahedral Fe3+ may originate from coulombic repulsion 

between the randomly distributed oxygen vacancies. Consequently, the low level of oxygen deficiency, 

comparatively high content of chromium-oxygen polyhedra suppressing the formation of Fe-O-Fe chains as 

well as the incapability of Fe cations to adopt the tetrahedral oxygen coordination in the present composition, 

in contrast to the brownmillerite structures, seem responsible for the improved thermodynamic stability of 

(La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? in the entire p(O2) range studied. This conclusion is consistent with the results 

reported in [169, 179], where the compositions with significantly higher quantities of Sr and Fe atoms 

maintain the disordered perovskite structure.

3.2.2. Thermal and chemical expansion 

 

Fig. 3.23 presents typical dilatometric curves of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? ceramics at atmospheric 

p(O2) and in flowing CO - CO2 mixture where the oxygen partial pressure, continuously controlled by an 

electrochemical oxygen sensor, was 3×10-20 atm at 923 K and 2×10-12 atm at 1223 K. In both cases the 

thermal expansion is essentially linear up to 1373 K. When pre-oxidized (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? is heated 

in CO - CO2 atmosphere, a significant chemical contribution to the apparent thermal expansion is observed at 

970 - 1220 K due to progressive oxygen losses from the perovskite lattice, similar to (La0.75-

xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr1-xTixO3-?. This effect becomes negligible on cooling back in the same atmosphere, since 

the low oxygen content in the gas phase does not allow to replenish the losses.

The average TECs of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? are relatively low, (10.3 - 11.3)×10
-6 K-1, and tend 

to slightly decrease on reduction (Table 3.11), consistently with the common expansion behaviour of 

chromite perovskites in various atmospheres, discussed in Chapter 3.1.3. The TECs evaluated are close to 

data for Fe-substituted chromites, with iron content is ?50% [163, 212], and are substantially lower compared 

to ferrites or Fe- and Sr-rich (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-? [179, 266], presumably due to the stabilization of Fe
3+ state, 

validated by the Mössbauer spectroscopy. 

The values of isothermal expansion caused by reduction of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? perovskites 

in CO-CO2 gas mixtures are presented in Table 3.12. In accordance with the trends exhibited by the oxygen 

nonstoichiometry variation, Fe-doping substantially increases the chemically-induced strains, up to ~0.2%. 

Note that the apparent lattice expansivity might also be contributed by the "rhombohedral" - "orthorhombic" 

structural transition occurring on reduction (Fig. 3.20). Nevertheless, the overall level of the chemical 

expansion is modest and comparable with the values for B-site doped chromites reported in literature [194, 

235, 237] and shown in Fig. 1.2.7. The moderate thermal and chemical expansion is expected to ensure an 

acceptable mechanical compatibility of the perovskites studied with common solid electrolytes.

3.2.3. Mixed electronic and ionic conductivity 

 

The conductivity of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? under oxidizing and reducing conditions shows the 

features typical for p-type electronic conductors and described in Chapter 3.1.4. Examples of p(O2) 

dependencies of the total conductivity and Seebeck coefficient are demonstrated in Fig. 3.24. Increasing iron 

content leads to lower conductivity, consistently with the observation of the constant oxidation state of Fe, 

since introduction of “inert” iron cations into B-sublattice should reduce the number of available sites for 

location of holes and diminish the concentration of Cr4+ species responsible for the electron transport. On the 

other hand, previous reports indicate a promotion of the electronic transfer by Fe doping into chromites [131, 

179]. One should note that the conductivity behaviour of chromites substituted with 3d-cations may be 

completely different in various compositional ranges, depending on the particular transport mechanism [164-

166, 170].

Fig. 3.24. Oxygen partial pressure dependencies of the total conductivity (A, C) and Seebeck coefficient (B, 
D) of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? ceramics 

 

 

 As the oxygen nonstoichiometry variations in oxidizing atmospheres are very minor (Fig. 3.22), the 

conductivity and Seebeck coefficient in the high-p(O2) range are essentially independent of the oxygen 

pressure , as shown in Fig. 3.24. Reduction results in progressive oxygen losses from the perovskite and in 

decreasing Cr4+ concentration, yielding the lower conductivity and higher thermopower. No n-type 

conductivity branch typical for Fe-enriched perovskites [179, 217] was observed, although a gradual 

lowering of the slope of the conductivity (Fig. 3.24C) and rapid drop of Seebeck coefficient (Fig. 3.24D) for 

x = 0.4 occurring on strong reduction might be indicative of a contribution of electronic charge carriers into 

the overall transport mechanism. 

The oxygen permeability measurements were carried out on dense (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? 

membranes exposed to flowing air and H2 - H2O - N2 at the feed and permeate sides, respectively. The results 

indicated that  the overall kinetics is governed by the bulk ionic diffusion. Increasing Fe content in perovskite 

renders higher values of the permeation fluxes indicating a promotion of the ionic diffusion by the presence 

of iron cations with flexible coordination number. The ionic conductivity estimated in accordance with Eq. 

(2.10) varies in the range (5 - 8)×10-2 S×cm-1 at 1223 K. This level is somewhat lower in comparison with 

La0.33Sr0.67Cr0.33Fe0.67O3-? [179] indicating a positive effect of Sr- or Fe-doping on the oxygen diffusivity due 

to increasing the oxygen vacancy concentration and weakening metal-oxygen bonds, provided that no 

structural transformations negatively affecting the ionic transport occur.

3.2.4. Anode properties 

 

SEM analysis of the electrode layers of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? deposited onto LSGM 

electrolyte pellets (preliminary coated with CGO20 sublayer) showed a sufficient porosity and a relatively 

large surface area (Fig. 3.25), ensuring gas penetration and facile surface exchange processes. The average 

grain diameter in the electrode layers varied in the range 0.5 - 2 mm. No exfoliation or visible reaction traces 

between (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? and CGO20 layers were observed. The polarization tests during over 150 

h did not show any significant changes of the electrode grain size.

(La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? tends to moderately decrease with increasing x, in correlation with the electronic 

conductivity variations. Detailed analysis of the electrode behaviour and comparison of the electrochemical 

activity with other perovskite-based anode layers is given in Chapter 5.

3.3. Characterization of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? ceramics and electrodes 
 

As demonstrated in previous sections, anode layers based on (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? and 

(La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-? oxides suffer from the drop of the electronic conductivity under reducing conditions and 

rather low or moderate catalytic activity. In the search of potential alternative anode materials, another 

approach of optimization of the electrode performance is undertaken related with intentional introduction of 

Ni cations into the perovskite structure and subsequent precipitation of catalytically-active metallic phase 

under operation conditions. The choice of the concentration of acceptor-type dopants was selected by such a 

way so as to incorporate a slightly higher Ni content in comparison with the solubility limit in reducing 

atmospheres, without formation of any secondary phases capable to deteriorate the activity, and to avoid a 

substantial decomposition of the perovskite structure which might negatively influence the transport and 

thermomechanical properties. In particular, the cation content in A-sublattice was taken in a slight deficit in 

comparison with that of B-site cations, in order to promote the exsolution of Ni particles and avoid a 

separation of La- or Sr-enriched compounds. 

In LaCrO3-? substituted with only one type of acceptor-type dopants, at least 40 - 50 % of Mg or Ni 

may be dissolved in the perovskite structure [131, 142, 181, 183], while the solubility of Sr is assessed to be 

below 25% [44, 139, 149]. The simultaneous presence of these cations mutually reduces the solubility limits, 

especially at reduced p(O2) [151, 184, 185, 265], although one may observe some discrepancy between the 

reported data. Whatever the trends in the solubility of acceptor-type cations, an excess of Mg and Ni species 

in the composition may be considered to be beneficial. Since reduction of (Mg,Ni)O oxide or related 

compounds enables to obtain more dispersed Ni particles in comparison with those produced by reducing 

metallic Ni, as was demonstrated in [578, 579], even in the case of separation of (Mg,Ni)O phase under 

ambient conditions, subsequent reduction of the mixture is expected to produce an anode with enhanced 

catalytic activity. Taking into account the literature data on the dopant solubility in chromites and a 

preferability of a slight excess of Mg and Ni species, the present part is focused on characterization and 

evaluation of the electrode activity of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? perovskite. 

 

3.3.1. Phase behaviour and thermal expansion under oxidizing conditions 

 

The characterization of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? powdered and ceramic samples was 

carried out in framework of collaborative work involving researchers from the Department of Materials and 

Ceramic Engineering/CICECO, University of Aveiro, and the North Carolina A&amp;amp;T State University. At 

different stages of this work, important contributions were made by Dr. S.N. Yarmolenko, Prof. J. Sankar, 

Dr. A.V. Kovalevsky and Dr. Y.V. Pivak. The details of the room- and high-temperature XRD studies, TEM 

analysis, measurements of the total conductivity and thermal expansion are described in Chapter 2. 

An excess of B-cations in the perovskite lattice induced separation of a phase, isostructural to 

Mg0.4Ni0.6O ( 3Fm m ), as shown in Fig. 3.30. This phenomenon does not seem to be a drawback, since further 

reduction of both the perovskite and the (Mg,Ni)O phase ensures segregation of dispersed  Ni particles. 

Moreover, a reasonable oversaturation of the perovskite composition with B-site cations should avoid a 



145 
 

formation of La- or Sr-enriched phases at low p(O2), detrimental in terms of the transport and electrocatalytic 

properties.

observed and calculated data. The vertical bars correspond to Bragg reflections of the perovskite phase (top)

Fig. 3.28 represents a dilatometric curve of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? ceramics, obtained in 

the continuous heating regime in air. A drastic change in the expansion behaviour was found at ~370 K, 

attributable to a structural transition from the low-temperature orthorhombic perovskite (S.G.: Pnma) to 

rhombohedral structure (S.G.: 3R c ) at elevated temperatures. More detailed high-temperature XRD studies 

presented in Appendix A confirmed the transition occurring at 350 - 370 K. One should note that the 

enlargement of the unit cell volume on heating, calculated from the unit cell parameters of the hexagonal 

phase and expressed in the linear scale, reasonably correlates with the expansion measured by dilatometry in 

the corresponding temperature region, as shown in Fig. 3.28. 

The transformation of the crystal lattice is in accordance with numerous reports on the structural 

behaviour of chromite perovskites; in particular, the transition orthorombic - rhombohedral in LaCrO3-? was 

found at 520 - 560 K, shifting to lower temperatures upon Sr doping [112, 131, 183]. The presence of small 

amounts of Ni in La(Cr,Ni)O3-? extends the domain of existence of the orthorhombic perovskites towards 

higher temperatures [183]. On the other hand, introduction of Ni into La1-xSrxCr1-yNiyO3-? ensures the 

transition of the orthorombic structure into rhombohedral one occurring at x = 0.2 - 0.25 and y = 0.05 - 0.1 

under ambient conditions, as shown in works [176, 181, 187]. In contrast, introducing Mg elevates the 

transformation temperature [112]. Approximate temperatures corresponding to the structural transformations 

of chromite-based materials in air are indicated in Table 3.13. The combined effect of the presence of the 

acceptor cations as well as the A-site cation deficiency in the present composition is the shift of the transition 

temperature down to 350 - 370 K.

Despite the apparently large dimension variations in the vicinity of the phase transformation, further 

studies of the transport and electrochemical properties revealed no effects associated with mechanical 

degradation of the material. Above the transition temperature, the dilatometric curve shows almost linear 

behaviour (Fig. 3.28). For the whole range of oxygen partial pressures studied, the average TECs are 

relatively low and vary in a narrow range (10.2 - 11.7)×10-6 K-1 (Table 3.14). Reduction leads to a decrease 

of the expansion coefficient, similar for (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? and (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-? perovskites.

3.3.2. Total conductivity and phase relationships on reduction 

 
The total conductivity of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? is predominantly electronic with electron 

holes hopping over B-site cation matrix, and shows the same general trends as (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-? and 

(La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? perovskites (Figs. 3.29 - 3.30). However, for Sr-, Mg- and Ni-doped chromites the 

low-p(O2) behaviour, among other common factors, may be influenced by formation of nano-sized Ni 

particles detected by TEM analysis (Fig. 3.31), either precipitated from the perovskite phase or generated by 

reduction of the (Mg,Ni)O impurity. In the former case, the process should be accompanied by extensive 

oxygen losses resulting in a decrease of the concentration of p-type charge carriers accompanied with a drop 

of the electronic conductivity and a raise of the Seebeck coefficient. The formation of metallic Ni was 

confirmed by XRD inspection of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? ceramics, quenched after reduction at 

p(O2) = 10

Due to the segregation of the metallic phase from (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-?, the phase 

boundaries of the perovskite are close to those of reduction of NiO into metallic state [41]. This factor 

indicates that the conductivity drop for the title composition is primarily associated with Ni segregation, 

although Ni2+ cations in the perovskite phase are to some extent stabilized in comparison with the simple 

oxide. Another particularity of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? relates to comparatively high decomposition 

enthalpy, possibly attributable to kinetic stabilization of the phase at lower temperatures. This suggestion is 

consistent with the observation that no conductivity drop was found at the temperatures below 1023 K (Fig. 

3.29), which enables to preserve nearly constant total conductivity in the entire p(O2) region studied, 

including the anodic conditions.

3.3.3. Electrode activity 

 

The present section is devoted to consideration of electrode layers (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? 

applied onto La10Si5AlO26.5 and LSGM electrolytes preliminary coated with CGO20 sublayer. The effect of 

the presence of the sublayer and detailed characterization of the anode layers is addressed in Chapter 5.

SEM analysis shown in Fig. 3.33 revealed sufficiently porous electrode layers, with reliable contact 

between the cell components. The thickness of the layers varied in the range 50 - 80 µ m. No substantial 

microstructural changes were revealed after electrochemical testing the electrodes under reducing or 

oxidizing conditions, except for formation of agglomerates of catalytically active reagents (CeO2-?, Ni, PrOx) 

introduced during the procedure of the electrochemical testing. 

Despite the comparable or even lower level of the total conductivity in oxidative atmospheres, the 

performance of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? cathodes is significantly better in comparison with 

(La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? and (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? perovskites (Fig. 3.34), possibly due the presence of buffer layer 

in the former case, microstructural peculiarities or participation of (Mg,Ni)O impurity in the electrochemical 

process, as Ni-containing phases possess an enhanced catalytic activity towards redox processes [578, 593].

The activity of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? was found to be higher on LSGM electrolyte than 

on apatite-type electrolytes, in accordance with a poor performance of silicate-based electrochemical cells 

[566, 591, 594]. Similar to (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? cathodes, the polarization resistances may be substantially 

reduced by distribution of PrOx phase over the electrode layer, possibly attributable to insufficient activity of 

the non-modified perovskite phase or microstructure-related improvements. Another particularity of the title 

cathodes is rather similar polarization behaviour under cathodic and anodic currents; the trend becomes more 

obvious after addition of PrOx (Fig. 3.34). As discussed in previous sections, for (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? 

cathodes deposited directly onto the gallate or silicate electrolytes, the anodic polarization is substantially 

lower in comparison with cathodic one, presumably due to dissolution of transition metal cations in the 

electrolyte and their influence on the transport characteristics of the latter. In turn, this effect may be 

governed by current-induced oxidation or reduction of the cations dissolved. The presence of the sublayer in 

the present case seems to suppress the cation interdiffusion. While (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? cathodes 

applied directly onto apatite electrolyte showed substantially larger polarization values under cathodic 

polarization, presumably due to formation of additional interstitial oxygen species and promotion of the ionic 

transport of the apatite phase, for Sr-, Mg- and Ni-doped chromite cathode with CGO20 sublayer the effect of 

the current direction is less obvious. One should not also neglect a possible direct participation of the ceria-

based phase in the electrochemical process with resultant influence on the electrode mechanism, an 

enlargement of the TPB or minor current-induced microstructural changes. 

Apart from the low activity found for cathodes on apatite-type electrolyte, these cells also suffer 

from a noticeable degradation, as shown in Fig. 3.35. No observable performance loss was found for similar 

cathodes deposited onto gallate electrolytes, although longer testing is necessary for certain conclusions. As 

indicated in [566, 580, 594], the apatite phases are prone to segregation of silica and its subsequent spreading 

along the interfaces or TPB, while the electrolyte material suffers from a degradation of the transport and 

mechanical properties.

Fig. 3.36 shows typical impedance spectra collected for a cathode (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? 

in contact with LSGM electrolyte. The impedance arc related to the electrode process is dominated by the 

process characterized by the frequency domain 0.1 - 100 Hz; the corresponding resistance decreases upon 

cathodic or anodic polarization. One may observe an additional small semicircle at higher frequencies which 

seems to grow under anodic currents. Whatever the contributions into the overall electrode mechanism, the 

polarization resistances evaluated from the impedance spectra are consistent with those found from the slope 

of the polarization curves, as shown in Fig. 3.37. More detailed analysis of the impedance data is problematic 

due to poor resolution between the impedance arcs as well as by complexity to prepare identical electrode 

layers with a good reproducibility of the impedance characteristics by the procedure undertaken in the 

present study. One should emphasize that no optimization of the electrode fabrication route was attempted 

here, since the primarily task of the work is related with revealing the relationships between the composition, 

functional characteristics and performance-determining factors of perovskite-based electrodes.  

The polarization resistance of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? cathodes on LSGM electrolyte 

varies in the range 1- 3 Ohm×cm2 at 1073 K. Although the performance may further be improved by PrOx 

introduction, the overall level of the electrochemical performance is insufficient for the practical utilizations 

under oxidizing conditions. 

Another concern related with the applicability of Cr-enriched materials as cathodes is a strong 

vaporization of Cr-containing volatile species [82-85] and formation of multivalent chromium-based 

compounds on the perovskite surface [44, 139], promoted by high oxygen pressure in the cathodic 

atmosphere. The latter problem becomes even more critical in water vapour-containing environments; 

therefore, a special equipment is required for preliminary drying of oxidizing gases in order to operate with 

chromite-based cathodes, which increases the costs and complexity of the electrochemical devices.

CGO20 sublayer is also somewhat improved in comparison with (La0.75Sr0.25)Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? analogue (Fig. 

3.38), possibly due to comparatively high level of the electronic conductivity preserved down to anodic 

conditions (Fig. 3.29) or participation of reduced Ni particles in electrochemical processes. Nevertheless, the 

overpotential of ~110 mV shown under current 80 mA/cm2 at 1073 K for non-modified electrode layer still 

requires further optimization of the anode composition for the electrochemical applications.

3.4. Final remarks on chromite-based electrode materials 

 

In the present section three various series of doped chromites were characterized as potential 

electrode materials. The choice of the compositions was primarily based on a possible modification of the 

ionic transport and catalytic activity induced by appropriate doping in A- and B-sublattice with simultaneous 

preservation of the chemical and thermomechanical stability as well as of an acceptable level of the total 

conductivity in a wide p(O2) range. Moreover, the amounts of B-site cation dopants were selected as high as 

possible (i.e. at the limit of phase stability) in order to diminish Cr content and avoid the contamination of the 

cell components induced by chromium diffusion, vaporization/deposition, etc. 

In accordance with literature reports and results shown in the work, most chromites exhibit 

structural transformations upon thermal or redox cycling; selected examples are demonstrated in Fig. 3.28 

and Table 3.13. Although no influence of the transition on the integrity of ceramics or electrode layers was 

detected, in the case of long-term utilization one should take into account that the electrochemical cell may 

be exposed to multiple thermal or redox cycles. In accordance with [169, 177], reduction-induced transitions 

in chromites basically proceed slowly, without any noticeable effects on the overall expansion behaviour. If 

the issue of the structural transitions cannot be avoided it would be reasonable to focus further efforts on the 

achieving more gradual transformations to prevent mechanical damages. On the other hand, slow structural 

rearrangements may be accompanied by hindered equilibration of the transport and dimensional properties 

and resultant negative influence on the functional characteristics of the materials. 

The surface-related processes, presence of the secondary phases, structural transformations, slow 

equilibration kinetics in the intermediate-p(O2) range result in hysteresis behaviour of the conductivity 

observable on the chromite-based materials upon consecutive reduction and oxidation runs (Fig. 3.39).

Nevertheless, no strong degradation upon redox cycling was observed, as indicated by 

comparatively small deviations between the reduction and oxidation curves, while the initial level of the 

conductivity was nearly recovered after a cycle. Such a behaviour is consistent with high chemical and 

thermomechanical stability of chromites in a wide p(O2) region and may be regarded to be beneficial 

compared with (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? perovskites where the hysteresis is more substantial and the conductivity 

shows a drastic drop after redox cycling, possibly associated with mechanical failure of the materials. 

One of the major problems associated with the processing of Cr-enriched electrode materials relates 

to the strong tendency of chromites towards surface oxidation under ambient conditions [44, 132, 137, 138]. 

Fig. 3.40 represents heating behaviour of selected Cr-containing perovskites studied in the present work. One 

may observe that the most substantial mass changes originating from release of adsorbed oxygen, H2O or 

CO2 gaseous species and resultant strong hysteresis on thermal cycling are relevant to the materials with 

higher Cr content indicating that these perovskites are more susceptible towards chemical changes at low 

temperatures in atmospheric air. In terms of the anode applications, the phenomena indicated may induce 

mechanical failure or loss of activity due to cation redistribution over the material, microstructural 

degradation, changes in the surface properties, etc. This requires a stringent control of the cell operation 

procedure and the ambient conditions surrounding the chromite-based anodes. One should note that 

variations of the chemical state of the surface are also typical for Ti-enriched compositions; an example is 

demonstrated in Fig. 3.40A.

155 
 

As follows from the trends shown in Fig. 3.40, replacement of Cr with other transition metal cations 

is desirable in order to provide the tolerance towards the ambient conditions. Furthermore, the intrinsic 

electrocatalytic activity of chromites is rather low unless improved by additional components which also 

requires introduction of cations which facilitate the ionic transport and exchange kinetics. However, the 

results of electrochemical testing showed that reduction of Cr content in (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? 

and (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? leads to lower anode activity, possibly due to suppressed electronic transport 

(Fig. 3.16 and Fig. 3.26). Therefore, one should find a compromise between the positive effects (oxygen 

diffusivity, catalytic properties, suppression of the formation of high-valent chromium species) and possible 

disadvantages (worse chemical and thermomechanical stability and promotion of the conductivity drop) 

caused by the presence of acceptor-type and/or transition metal dopants the perovskite phase. To some 

extent, promising combinations of the functional characteristics were demonstrated for (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-

xFexO3-? and (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? at reduced temperatures (Fig. 3.26, Fig. 3.38); as a result, 

these groups of anode materials showed the highest potential for further studies which should primarily 

include the stability of the electrochemical characteristics, since the nearly constant level of the electronic 

conductivity seems to be associated with kinetic factors. 

Although chromite-based compositions are not generally considered as SOFC cathode components 

due to insufficient activity towards oxygen reduction [587, 595], selected characteristics obtained for 

cathodes (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? and (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? may have an impact on 

development of the electrodes for fabrication of symmetrical electrochemical cells. However, the level of the 

polarization resistances of 1 - 3 Ohm×cm2 is too high with respect to the requirements for cathode materials, 

while the problems related with poor chemical stability and contamination of cell components with 

chromium species necessitate reducing Cr content and make the issue of cathode applications of chromites 

arguable.

Chapter 4. Transport, thermomechanical and electrochemical properties of 

manganite-based perovskites  

 

As discussed in Chapter 1.3, recent studies on doped manganites revealed a proper combination of 

the transport properties and catalytic activity, while the main drawbacks associated with insufficient tolerance 

towards reductive conditions may be overcome by kinetic stabilization or replacement of Mn with an 

appropriate amount of high-valent cations [8, 16, 95, 306, 317]. In particular, among chromite- and titanate-

based anodes, promising characteristics have been found for (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? and (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? 

compositions, while increasing Mn content in these groups of perovskites was shown to be beneficial in 

terms of the electrocatalytic properties [16, 210, 352]. 

One of the most crucial issues related with application of manganites in reducing atmospheres is that 

stabilization of the perovskite structure by an appropriate B-site substitution basically causes a deterioration 

of the transport properties and electrode activity (see, in particular, Table 1.3.2). As a result, the optimum 

combination of the functional characteristics was in most cases found for manganites with minimum 

substitution degree in B-sublattice [95, 210, 306], despite the facilitated oxygen losses and promoted drop of 

the conductivity. However, the insufficient thermodynamic stability may induce degradation of the 

performance in long-term scale, mechanical damage, etc. Therefore, doping strategies should satisfy the 

following requirements: 1. the sufficient electronic conduction and acceptable electrocatalytic activity 

relevant to manganites should be preserved; 2. the domain of p(O2) where the functional characteristics are 

maintained should be expanded. 

Despite a large potential of manganite-based anodes, the number of studies devoted to their 

applicability under reducing conditions is scarce in comparison with chromite or titanate perovskites. The 

present section is focused on evaluation of phase, structural, microstructural, thermomechanical, transport 

and electrochemical behaviour of A(Mn,Nb)O3-? (A = Ca, Sr) and (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? perovskites. 

 

4.1. Perovskite-like SrMn1-xNbxO3-? and CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? 

 

Nb-doping into perovskites has been regarded as an effective way to stabilize the perovskite 

structure or expand the phase boundaries of perovskites towards more reductive conditions [20, 130, 596]. 

Due to extremely low reduction potential, any contribution of Nb5+/4+ couple into the overall electronic 

conductivity may hardly be expected; however, donor-doping into CaMnO3-? and SrMnO3-? is favourable in 

terms of excitation of additional n-type carriers. On the other hand, high Nb amount reduces the population 

of available sites for electronic transport. In the case of large overall content of donor-like cations in the 

compound, an excess of cation vacancies may be required for the charge compensation which may provoke a 

transformation of the perovskite lattice into ordered structures. To avoid such a possibility, manganites 

CaMnO3-? and SrMnO3-? were selected as parent compositions for assessment of the effect of Nb-doping. 

Depending on the oxygen deficiency which may achieve 0.5 per perovskite formula unit, CaMnO3-? 

exists in orthorhombic, tetragonal or cubic structure; the symmetry is higher for oxygen-deficient 



157 
 

compositions [597-599]. As reported by Kruth et al. [600], up to 60% Nb may be introduced into B-sublattice 

of CaMnO3-?; further Nb-doping induces separation of Ca2Nb2O7-based phases. The orthorhombic lattice 

symmetry is generally preserved upon doping provided that the oxygen deficiency is below 0.2 [600]. No 

cation ordering in Ca(Mn,Nb)O3-? has been observed [600-602], while at low Nb doping level as well as in 

parent CaMnO3-? formation of oxygen vacancy-ordered superstructures on reduction was reported [600]. The 

latter information is, however, contradictive [597-600]. The orthorhombic perovskite structure with cation 

disorder has also been reported for Ta- or Sb-substituted CaMnO3-? [601-603]. The studies on Ca(Mn,Nb)O3-? 

concerned mainly their structural characteristics, phase relationships, oxygen nonstoichiometry and low-

temperature magnetic and transport properties, while reports on their properties with respect to high-

temperature electrochemical applications have not been found. 

The perovskite structure of SrMnO3-? is stable only at the temperatures above ~1310 K in air; the 

crystal symmetry is cubic or orthorhombic symmetry depending on the oxygen content [330, 604]. On 

cooling the lattice adopts four-layers hexagonal structure. In order to stabilize the perovskite lattice, the 

composition is basically doped with donor-like cations; in particular, introducing 10 - 30% of Ce into A-

sublattice was shown to be beneficial for preserving the structure and improving the transport properties 

[330, 605]. Similar effects might be expected for doping with Nb. At the same time, the reports on the 

structural behaviour of Nb-doped SrMnO3-? are contradictive. No indication of cation ordering have been 

reported by Lufaso et al. [601, 602], based on neutron diffraction studies. On the other hand, in [19, 20] the 

structure was identified as cubic perovskite with ordering in B-sublattice. Reduction causes transformation 

into disordered cubic structure, while the perovskite phase was shown to be stable in 5% H2 - Ar. The 

conductivity, however, is rather low, which, in particular, yielded poor cathodic performance [591]. 

The present section is devoted to evaluation of the effect of A-site cation nature and Mn:Nb atomic 

ratio on the structural, microstructural, transport and thermomechanical properties of A(Mn,Nb)O3-? 

perovskites. 

 

4.1.1. Phase relationships and structure 

 

SrMn1-xNbxO3-? with x = 0.2 - 0.5 are single phase perovskites after preparation in air (Fig. 4.1). For 

x = 0.4, the structure was identified as rhombohedral ( c3R ), while the compositions with x = 0.2 and x = 0.5 

were refined in cubic symmetry (Table 4.1), although the space groups were identified to be different due to 

possible B-site ordering for Nb-enriched perovskite. As found by Tao et al [20], ordering between Mn and 

Nb cations taking place in SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? under oxidizing conditions may be detected by the appearance of 

a characteristic peak at 2? ? 37.6º in XRD pattern. The same peak was found in the present work (inset in the 

upper pattern in Fig. 4.1) which disappears upon reduction indicating a possible cation disordering. The 

ordered perovskite structures have also been reported for relative compositions, namely for SrMn0.5Sb0.5O3-? 

[606] and to some extent for SrMn0.5Ta0.5O3-? [606]. Although more accurate techniques than XRD are 

required to detect the formation of superstructures, in the present work the structures of SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? 

prepared in air and after annealing in 10% H2 - N2 were refined with space group Fm3m  and Pm3m ,

respectively (Table 4.1). One should separately note that no accent on the structural characteristics was made 

in this study. This, in particular, is related with the fact that by far no obvious benefit or disadvantage of the 

cation ordering on the electrochemical characteristics of perovskites has been reported, as both ordered and 

disordered structures have shown a potential for the electrode applications [8, 16, 126, 129]. 

Analyzing the behaviour of the cell parameters indicated in Table 4.1, Nb-doping expands the cell 

volume, referred to the primitive cubic perovskite cell. This trend is expectable, since the ionic radius of Nb5+ 

is larger in comparison with Mn4+ (0.64 vs. 0.53 Å) which dominates in the perovskite lattice of the parent 

SrMnO3-?. Moreover, introduction of the donor-type cation should induce reducing the oxidation state of Mn 

species; the cation radius of Mn3+ is 0.645 Å, also larger in comparison with Mn4+. The ionic radii are given 

assuming the octahedral coordination for all the atoms and high-spin state for Mn3+ [133]. A similar increase 

of the cell parameters in orthorhombic settings on Nb doping was observed for Ca(Mn,Nb)O3-? series [600].

As can be found from the relative density of sintered ceramics of Sr(Mn,Nb)O3-? (Table 4.1) and 

corresponding SEM images (Fig 4.2), introducing Nb results in a larger volume fraction of pores and smaller 

grain size, due to suppressed sinterability. Irrespective to the worse quality of SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? ceramics, the 

pores seem to be separated from each other, which should not significantly affect the transport 

characteristics; all the ceramic samples Sr(Mn,Nb)O3-? were verified to be gas-tight.

On the other hand, Nb-doping improves the stability of the perovskites in reductive atmospheres 

(Fig. 4.1). After annealing under reducing conditions, single-phase perovskite was only found to form at x = 

0.5 (S.G.: Pm3m ); SrMn0.8Nb0.2O3-? tends to the complete decomposition, while SrMn0.6Nb0.4O3-? forms a 

mixture of rhombohedral ( 3R c ) and orthorhombic (Pnma) phases with minor MnO impurity alike to 

(La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-?. An example of refining of the 3-phase mixture obtained on reduction of 

SrMn0.6Nb0.4O3-? is demonstrated in Fig. 4.3, while the parameters and fraction of the constituent phases are 

listed in Table 4.2. The stability of manganites shows a correlation with TGA data in air which demonstrated 

larger changes of the oxygen nonstoichiometry for Mn-rich materials, as will be discussed below.

The cell parameters calculated for SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? perovskite increase in reducing atmospheres due 

to increasing radii of B-site cations (Table 4.1), in accordance with generation of large Mn3+ or even Mn2+ or 

Nb4+ cations. Exposure to mildly reducing conditions causes a ~1.5% increment of the volume cell, while 

maintenance in dry H2 at 1223 K yields the volume expansivity of ~3%. 

In accordance with previous reports [600, 601], CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? was refined as orthorhombic 

perovskite with GdFeO3-?-like structure (S.G. Pbnm); the XRD patterns and corresponding cell parameters 

are presented in Fig. 4.4 and Table 4.3. The deviations in the lattice parameters observable in Table 4.3. 

might be attributed to various preparation conditions. Reduction in 10% H2 - N2 - H2O gas mixture leads to a 

partial decomposition and a loss of crystallinity (Fig. 4.4); the lower stability compared with Sr(Mn,Nb)O3-? 

analogue is consistent with larger oxygen losses in CaMnO3-?-based composition, as discussed below.

No structural transformations were detected after thermal or moderate p(O2) variations within the 

accuracy of XRD method; the cell parameters of materials quenched in air or in Ar are listed in Table 4.3. 

The cell parameters increase during procedures which promote formation of oxygen vacancies, i.e. exposure 

to high temperature, especially at reduced p(O2), with subsequent rapid cooling. One may observe a 

similarity between the parameters obtained for the powders quenched or cooled with the rate of 5 K/min in 

air from the same temperature demonstrating that the rate indicated is too rapid for achieving the equilibrium. 

Nevertheless, the variations of the cell parameters upon moderate reduction is not high; in particular, 

exposure of CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? to Ar atmosphere with subsequent quenching causes a ~0.3% increase of the 

cell volume. 

 

4.1.2. Thermal expansion 

 

Nb-doping into SrMnO3-? reduces the thermal expansion, as shown in Fig. 4.5 and Table 4.4. This 

trend is opposite to the behaviour of the cell volume on variation of Nb content calculated at room 

temperature (Table 4.1), and might primarily originate from suppressed oxygen losses on thermal cycling and 

resultant decrease of the chemical contribution into the entire expansion for Nb-enriched materials. The latter 

suggestion is confirmed by an increase of the expansivity on heating (Table 4.4), more pronounced for the 

SrMn0.8Nb0.2O3-?, while the perovskites with higher Nb concentration show nearly linear behaviour. 

If considering the entire temperature interval studied, replacement of Ca for Sr decreases the 

average TEC originating from smaller ionic radius of Ca or structural particularities. More detailed analysis 

shows that the expansion in the high-temperature range is substantially enhanced for CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? and 

overcomes the TEC value for Sr-containing analogue, as shown in Fig. 4.5 and Table. 4.4.

The large difference between the coefficients in the low-and high-temperature intervals combined 

with the slow equilibration kinetics discussed below might be responsible for accumulation of excessive 

stresses in CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? ceramics resulting in formation and propagation of cracks, as shown in Fig. 

4.2D. In terms of the thermal expansion behaviour, the materials SrMn1-xNbxO3-? (x = 0.4 - 0.5) seem more 

attractive for the high-temperature applications, due to moderate and essentially constant TEC in the whole 

temperature range.

The expansion behavior of A(Mn,Nb)O3-? ceramics is consistent with the changes in oxygen 

nonstoichiometry observed by TGA (Fig. 4.6) which confirms that the expansivity is strongly contributed by 

the chemical constituent. In particular, SrMn0.8Nb0.2O3-? shows comparatively large oxygen losses (up to 

0.015 per perovskite formula unit) above 1000 K; this temperature is close to the point where a pronounced 

enhancement of the TEC takes place (Fig. 4.5). CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? also demonstrates an obvious extensive 

high-temperature oxygen release, unlike Sr-containing analogue, which also correlates with the dilatometric 

curves. Analyzing the behaviour of CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? ceramics, one should note a strong hysteresis 

observable on thermal cycling, and poor reproducibility of the results on subsequent heating and cooling runs 

(Fig. 4.7). The mass changes obtained by TGA (Fig. 4.8) are affected by cooling rate, while the equilibration 

of the mass in TGA tests was not achieved for more than 20 hours (inset in Fig. 4.8).

In accordance with the data reported in [600], the transformation of the orthorhombic structure of 

CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? into cubic was found when ? exceeds 0.2 - 0.25. Assuming the preservation of the single 

perovskite phase, the transition should occur when the fraction of Mn2+ species approaches the total amount 

of manganese cations, and further oxygen losses from the cubic phase should induce reduction of Nb5+ or 

Mn2+ species. Whatever the origin of the structural rearrangement, in the present study the variations in 

oxygen content in CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? in air are found to be much smaller, which should exclude any 

possibility of this transformation. XRD analysis carried out on quenched materials after annealing in air or Ar 

revealed no significant structural changes except for the increase of the lattice parameters. Nevertheless, 

taking into account the results of the thermal analysis as well as the slow equilibration kinetics, formation of 

domains with cubic or other symmetry might be expected, which content is below the sensitivity of XRD 



165 
 

technique. The increase of the cell volume (Table 4.3) confirms the suggestion that the structural variations 

are induced by oxygen losses. However, further studies are required for elucidation the factors responsible 

for the slow kinetics in CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? material.  

 

4.1.3. Total conductivity 

 

Considering the previous reports on the electronic transport in manganites of alkali-earth cations, the 

parent compositions SrMnO3-? and CaMnO3-? and their derivatives exhibit polaronic character of the 

conductivity with dominant n-type charge carriers, although the binding energy of mobile polarons is 

comparatively small which may induce metallic-like behaviour [330, 583, 595, 608]. The mobile electrons 

are localized on Mn species, and the concentration of the charge carriers may be quantitatively described via 

3-fold charged manganese cations. Generation of Mn3+ is associated with oxygen losses from the perovskite 

structure; the process corresponds to electron transition from half-filled t2g band to the eg band and may cause 

comparatively high electron mobility due to a minor occupancy of the latter. 

Donor-doping is regarded as another way to increase the concentration of n-type charge carriers. In 

particular, Ce-doping into A-sublattice of SrMnO3-? was shown to promote the electronic transport in the 

entire solubility domain, although the improvement might also be related with stabilization of the perovskite 

structure. Appearance of regions with substantially reduced activation energy or even metallic-like 

temperature dependence of the conductivity has been reported for SrMnO3-? [609, 610], (La,Sr)MnO3-? [323, 

583] or (Sr,Ce)MnO3-?-based compositions [320, 330, 605], indicative of possible broadband character of the 

electronic transfer, although the trends might also be attributed to structural transformations or extensive 

oxygen losses affecting the concentration of mobile charge carriers.

conductivity of SrMn1-xNbxO3-? and CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? 
ceramics in air. Data on the conductivity of 
SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? [330] and SrMnO3-? [20] are given for 
comparison. 



166 
 

As shown in Fig. 4.9, moderate Nb-doping (up to 20 mol.%) significantly improves the conductivity 

of SrMnO3-?, originating from generation of electrons via Nb introduction. The latter effect is qualitatively 

similar to Ce-doping into SrMnO3-? [330], although higher lattice symmetry in comparison with the 

hexagonal SrMnO3-? phase may also contribute to faster electronic transport. On further substitution with Nb, 

the conductivity substantially drops with simultaneous enhancement of the activation energy, as shown in 

Table 4.5. CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? and SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? exhibit nearly equal conductivity in the high-temperature 

interval, but the former perovskite is characterized by enhanced activation energy, possibly due to lower 

structural symmetry.

When Nb fraction in B-sublattice approaches 40 - 50%, Mn3+ cations become dominant species and 

the conductivity exhibits the trends typical for p-type electronic conductors. In particular, large negative 

Seebeck coefficients observable for SrMnO3-?, (Sr,Ce)MnO3-? or CaMnO3-? [330, 598, 611] become close to 

zero for SrMn0.6Nb0.4O3-? with subsequent inversion of the negative sign (Fig. 4.10). Analogously with 

(La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? system, this situation may correspond to reduction of the amount of p-type charge 

carriers below 50% of the overall density of states upon Nb-doping, as shown in Fig. 4.11; the values p/N and 

µ p were calculated using Eqs. (2.3) and (2.5) described in Chapter 2, assuming N equal to the overall amount 

of Mn species in the B sublattice. 

Heating induces generation of additional p-type charge carriers; this effect is more pronounced for 

SrMn0.6Nb0.4O3-?. Taking into account relatively small variations of the oxygen content (Fig. 4.6), the 

temperature effect might be primarily attributed to promotion of Mn3+ disproportionation. On the other hand, 

variations of the population of p-type carriers with temperature are rather small, as can be evaluated from the 

similarity of the activation energies of the total conductivity and hole mobility (Table 4.5). 

Substitution of Nb for Mn in Sr(Mn,Nb)O3-? substantially decreases the hole mobility and increases 

the corresponding activation energy. This indicates that apart from diminishing the amount of mobile 

carriers, the presence of inert Nb cations in the perovskite lattice hampers the electronic transfer, analogously 

with the trends observed in numerous perovskite systems [111, 306, 320, 596].

The conductivity and Seebeck coefficient are essentially p(O2)-independent in a wide range of 

partial pressures (Fig. 4.10).  On stronger reduction, the conductivity decreases, as demonstrated in Fig. 4.12. 

Similar trends have been observed for most manganite-based perovskites stable in a wide p(O2) range, 

including SrMn1-xNbxO3-? (x = 0.5 - 0.6) studied in [19, 20], although the conductivity obtained in the present 

study is ~3 times higher in comparison with the previously reported data. The conductivity and Seebeck 

coefficient show hysteresis behaviour on redox cycling; however, the characteristics are reversible which 

shows that no mechanical degradation occurs on p(O2) variations and the equilibration of SrMn1-xNbxO3-? 

ceramics takes place in a reasonable period. 

 
 
4.1.4. Oxygen permeability 

 
The level and basic trends of the parameters responsible for the oxygen ionic transport in Nb-doped  

SrMnO3-? ceramics were qualitatively assessed by comparison of the permeation fluxes j and specific oxygen 

permeability J(O2) through dense ceramics of SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? with the thickness of 0.60 and 1.00 mm. The 

behaviour of the permeability characteristics on changing the membrane thickness demonstrated in Fig. 4.13 

assumes that the oxygen flux is limited by both bulk oxygen diffusion and surface exchange kinetics, similar 

to (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? series and numerous chromite and manganite perovskites [252, 337, 338]. The 

activation energy of the fluxes under fixed gradient of the oxygen chemical potential is as high as ~230 

kJ/mol, close to the values found for Sr, Ti-doped (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr)O3-? ceramics, as shown in Table 3.7. 

The effect of the surface exchange limitations over SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? is especially pronounced at 

elevated temperatures, where decreasing the membrane thickness has a minor influence on the permeation 

fluxes. Subsequent cooling induces an enhancement of the difference between the fluxes for various 

thicknesses which assumes that the activation energy of the ionic diffusion is higher in comparison with the 

gas/solid exchange kinetics. In the family (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? as well as in perovskites characterized by 

slow ionic transport and hampered equilibration kinetics, the oxygen diffusion was shown to be strongly 

contributed by the diffusion along grain boundaries [112, 254, 336, 339]; a similar behaviour may be 

suggested for SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-?. 

Nb-doped SrMnO3-? shows some improvement in comparison with (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? series in 

terms of oxygen diffusivity, as demonstrated by 2-fold increase in the permeation fluxes, shown in Fig. 4.14. 

Using the model described in Chapter 2 (Eq. (2.11)), the oxygen ionic conductivity was estimated to be as 

low as 10-4 - 10-3 S/cm in the temperature interval studied, although any certain calculation is complicated by 

low values of the permeation fluxes and resultant large errors of the estimation. This level of ionic 

conductivity and the slow surface rates are too low to expect any extension of the electrochemical zone into 

the bulk phase of the materials studied. In particular, analogous measurements on (Sr,Ce)MnO3-? and 

(Sr,Ce)(Mn,Al)O3-? membranes as well as conductivity studies on SrFe0.6Nb0.4O3-? ceramics revealed the 

ionic conductivity ~1 order of magnitude higher in comparison with SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? [320, 596, 605]. The 

results indicate a negative influence of excessive Nb content on the ionic transfer, in accordance with a minor 

level of the oxygen vacancies (Fig. 4.6) and their reduced mobility in the vicinity of Nb atoms [596].

4.1.5. Electrode behaviour 

 

As shown in previous sections, the level of the electronic and ionic conductivity in SrMn1-xNbxO3-? 

(x = 0.4 - 0.5) is rather low to expect any noticeable electrochemical performance. Indeed, the electrode 

activity was evaluated to be poor under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. For example, the polarization 

resistance of the manganites in contact with LSGM electrolyte without especial modifications was evaluated 

in the range 10 - 20 Ohm×cm2. Decreasing Nb content slightly improves the anode performance, in 

accordance with the electronic conductivity behaviour. 

Polarization curves for SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? anode shown in Fig. 4.15 exhibit a slight improvement of 

the activity upon redox cycling. Possible origins this phenomenon as well analogues in literature will be 

discussed in Chapter 4.2.5 devoted to (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? anodes. One of likely activation mechanisms 

involves current-induced microstructural variations; however, for Nb-doped SrMnO3-? the decrease in the 

polarization resistance is within 15 - 20% and microscopic analysis (Fig. 4.16) does not allow to observe any 

obvious difference between the microstructures of the electrode layers before and after current application, 

both in cathodic and anodic direction. Selected approaches towards reduction of the polarization resistance of 

SrMn1-xNbxO3-? anodes involving, in particular, surface modifications or optimization of the half-cell 

composition, are considered in Chapter 5.

The cathodic performance of SrMn0.6Nb0.4O3-? is somewhat beneficial in comparison with 

(La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? series (Fig. 4.17), but still remains too low for practical applications or for any detailed 

considerations. In particular, the overpotential of non-modified SrMn0.6Nb0.4O3-? electrode on LSGM and 

La10Si5AlO26.5 electrolyte under the cathodic current of 25 mA/cm
2 achieves ~140 and ~410 Ohm×cm2 at 

1073 K, respectively. Corresponding values for (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? cathode achieve ~250 and &gt;500 

Ohm×cm2, respectively. Taking into account a comparable level of the total conductivity of SrMn0.6Nb0.4O3-? 

perovskites in oxidizing atmospheres, the improvement might be attributed to slightly higher content of Mn 

species in comparison with (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? series which are responsible for the cathode activity [210, 

324, 584]; another possibility relates to ionic transport which is estimated to be slightly better in SrMn1-

xNbxO3-? perovskites, as discussed in Chapter 4.1.4. 

Summarizing the general trends shown by the polarization curves under oxidizing atmospheres, one 

may emphasize the influence of the electrolyte nature and the presence of protective sublayer on both the 

level of the polarization resistance and on behaviour under cathodic and anodic polarization. The latter factor 

is in general agreement with the trends exhibited by (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? and (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-

? cathodes which were evaluated without and with the sublayer, correspondingly. In particular, cathodic 

currents applied on SrMn0.6Nb0.4O3-? layer on LSGM electrolyte induce lower polarization in comparison 

with the anodic currents.

The opposite trend was detected for similar cells with La10Si5AlO26.5 electrolyte; this behaviour is 

consistent with various nature of the charge carriers in the gallate and silicate phases (oxygen vacancies and 

interstitials, correspondingly) which are generated and eliminated under cathodic current, respectively. Such 

a dependence might indicate that the electrochemical process is governed by a supply/removal of oxygen 

species from/into the electrolyte phase. 

The presence of CGO20 sublayer or introduction of PrOx into the cathode layer reduces the 

polarization resistance down to ~7 Ohm×cm2 at 1073 K on La10Si5AlO26.5 electrolyte and transforms the 

appearance of the polarization curve from the Tafel-like to nearly linear dependencies (Figs. 4.17, 4.18). 

Nevertheless, the trends related with the current direction discussed above remain essentially similar. 

 

 

4.2. Physicochemical and electrode properties of (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? perovskites 

 

Due to attractive properties of titanates and manganites, the number of studies on (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? 

solid solutions as potential anode materials has been growing in last years.  Most works have been devoted to 

optimization of Mn:Ti ratio. Mn content was demonstrated to favorably influence the conductivity in 

oxidizing atmospheres (at least up to 60%), while under anodic conditions the effect of Mn fraction in 

La0.4Sr0.6Mn1-xTixO3-? is less obvious. On the other hand, increasing Mn content above 40 - 60% causes phase 

instability in reducing atospheres [16]. In terms of the electrode microstructure, the presence of Mn is noted 

to ensure a better wettability of zirconia-based phases and provide higher electrode performance [352]. 

Whatever the effect of Mn:Ti ratio, the functional properties might also be modified by compositional 

variations in A-sublattice. 

On the other hand, the contribution of metallic phases basically present in the electrode layers into 

the overall performance is not clear from the available data on the (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-?-based anodes. As the 

technology involving coating a metallic paste over the electrode cannot be utilized in industrial scale, it is 

necessary to estimate the activity of the anode layers more relevant to practical applications. Moreover, the 

presence of an additional component obscures the properties of the main electrode phase and does not allow 

to reveal relationships between the functional characteristics and anode activity of the electrode material, 

which might be important for further compositional modifications. 

As shown in Chapter 3.1, in (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? chromium may be partially or completely 

replaced by Ti with simultaneous equivalent substitution in A-sublattice. However, introduction of Sr and Ti 

reduces the electronic conductivity down to the level insufficient for the electrochemical applications, 

especially under anodic conditions while chemically-induced expansion achieves 0.6% for 

(La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-?. Although the latter composition did not exhibit a remarkable cathode or anode 

performance, further variations of the cation ratios might provide an acceptable combination of the functional 

properties. The present part is focused on evaluation of the effect of La:Sr cation ratio as well as A-site 

stoichiometry on the chemical and structural stability, thermomechanical properties, electronic and ionic 

conductivity and electrochemical performance of (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? (x = 0.15 - 0.75, y = 0 - 0.05) 

anodes in contact with LSGM electrolyte. The studies were partially carried out in the Institute of Solid State

4.2.1. Crystal structure 

 

XRD analysis showed formation of single phase perovskites La1-xSrxMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? (x = 0.4 - 0.5) 

and (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? (x = 0.15 - 0.75) after equilibration in air. The only exception relates to 

(La0.35Sr0.65)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? where one peak of Mn3O4, comparable to the background, might be suspected 

in the XRD pattern (Fig. 4.19). The crystal structure was refined as rhombohedrally-distorted perovskite 

(S.G.: c3R ). Similar symmetry has been earlier reported for other representatives of (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? 

series, namely, for La0.4Sr0.6Mn1-xTixO3-? (x = 0.4 - 0.8) [16], La0.8Sr0.2Mn0.9Ti0.1O3-? [238], La0.33Sr0.67Mn1-

The lattice parameters in hexagonal settings of (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? are listed in Table 4.6. In 

general, the unit cell volume of cation-deficient perovskites tends to decrease with increasing x. Taking into 

account that ionic radius of Sr2+ is larger in comparison with that of La3+ [133], the trend might primarily be 

associated with increasing average oxidation state of Mn species and their resultant shrinkage on Sr-doping 

(suggesting that Ti is completely oxidized). One should note that increasing fraction of Mn4+ in Sr-enriched 

perovskites is consistent with trends observed in electronic conductivity in air, discussed below. 

The creation of A-site cation vacancies leads to the unit cell volume expansion (Table 4.6), a result 

of stronger coulombic repulsion between the oxygen anions [613]. This factor also seems relevant for the La-

rich compositions, where the crystal electroneutrality and lattice conservation conditions may lead to the 

formation of extra cation vacancies instead of Mn2+.

No perovskite phase decomposition was observed on reduction in H2 - H2O - N2 atmospheres (Figs. 

4.21, 4.22). The traces of MnO observed in the XRD pattern of (La0.35Sr0.65)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? might originate 

from Mn3O4 reduction. Reduction of La-enriched compositions (x = 0.15 - 0.25) leads to structural 

transformation into the orthorhombic symmetry. Most likely, the transition is associated with extensive 

oxygen losses from the perovskite structure and generation of large Mn2+ and/or Ti3+ cations, as follows from 

the electroneutrality conditions. High quantities of these cations seem to lead to decreasing the tolerance 

factor, favoring the stabilization of the orthorhombic lattice. In accordance with the cell parameters of 

reduced perovskites (Table 4.7), the lattice volume of reduced (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? (x = 0.45 - 0.65) 

expands by 1 - 1.5 % with respect to the oxidized phases at room temperature due to lowering oxidation state 

of the B-site cations, increasing their average radii, and the oxygen vacancy formation promoting cation 

repulsion. Enrichment of the compositions with La up to 75 - 85% increases the relative difference between 

the cell volume of the reduced and oxidized phases up to 5 - 6 %, attributable to the structural 

transformations.

(La,Sr)Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? in fuel gases, although possible sulfur poisoning surface effects on the electrocatalytic 

activity require careful investigations.

Conditions of the thermal treatment are given in legends. 

 
 

Typical microstructures of (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3±? dense ceramics are illustrated in Fig. 4.22. 

The maximum grain size (50 - 100 µ m) was found for the materials with intermediate Sr content in the A-

sublattice, i.e. at x = 0.25 - 0.45. Reviewing the literature data on the relationships between the densification 

of manganites and titanates and their composition, one might observe that increasing Sr content in La1-

xSrxMnO3±? up to ~50% leads to smaller grain size. The effect is attributed to larger radius of Sr
2+ in 

comparison with La3+ hampering the A-site diffusion, as well as suppressed densification at high quantities of 

Mn4+ [614, 615]. One should also take into account that the cation diffusion in manganites and resultant grain 

growth are promoted by higher A-site cation deficiency [614-616] which decreases upon introduction of Sr 

into the perovskite [300, 303]. Similar effects might be expected for the (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3±? ceramics 

in the compositional range of 0.25&lt;x&lt;0.75. 

On the other hand, the grain growth taking place on incorporation of donor-like cations into A- or B-

sublattice of ATiO3-? perovskites (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) is maximum when the substitution is charge-compensated 

by other factors, such as a simultaneous generation of cation vacancies which enable to prevent a segregation 

of secondary phases or reduce the stresses in the lattice induced by generation of cations in the oxidation state 

unfavorable under given conditions (i.e. Ti3+) [247, 617, 618].

etched 
 

With respect to the present system, the largest grains should be observed for the perovskites, where 

the average oxidation state of Mn and Ti species is close to +3 and +4, respectively, while the oxygen content 

approaches the stoichiometric value. Such conditions should be satisfied for the composition with x ? 0.36, 

which explains the largest grain size of the nearest neighboring representatives in (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3±? 

series, i.e. for x = 0.25 and 0.45. 

Considering the possible reasons of the grain growth, one should also take into account a possible 

segregation of secondary phases in the quantities within the uncertainties of XRD analysis. In particular, as 

shown by micrographs in Figs. 4.22 B and C, the perovskites with intermediate Sr content showed the 

presence of another phase at the grain boundaries; the same materials showed the maximum grain growth. 

EDS analysis showed an enrichment of the impurity particles with Mn atoms. The presence of this phase as 

well as modest traces of glass-like phase might also contribute to better densification of the compositions 

with x = 0.25 - 0.45. On the other hand, the Mn-enriched impurity might be segregated during the preparation 

of ceramics for the microscope analysis and not reflect the general sintering behaviour of the materials.  

 

4.2.2. Thermal and chemical expansion 

 

Selected results of the controlled-atmosphere dilatometric measurements performed in the regimes 

of continuous heating and isothermal dwells with equilibration at 923 - 1223 K are presented in Figs. 4.23 

and 4.24, respectively. As for other titanate- and manganite-based materials, the apparent TECs vary in the 



178 
 

range (9.8 - 15.0)×10-6 K-1, slightly increasing on heating due to oxygen losses from the lattice (Fig. 4.23; 

Table 4.8). Introduction of Sr into (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-?, charge-compensated by increasing oxidation 

states of manganese cations, results in larger oxygen nonstoichiometry variations on heating or reduction. 

These variations are reflected by higher values of the apparent TECs under similar conditions (Table 4.8) and 

by larger chemical expansion (Fig. 4.24; Table 4.9). The TECs are essentially unaffected by oxygen partial 

pressure variations in oxidizing environments and tend to moderately increase in reducing atmospheres, again 

correlating with the chemically induced strains and conductivity variations discussed below.

The isothermal lattice expansion on reduction occurs due to lowering average oxidation state and 

increasing radius of the transition metal cations; the former factor is related to the concentration of electronic 

charge carriers, determining electronic conductivity and Seebeck coefficient. In accordance with the XRD 

results, the chemically induced expansion is lower than 0.03 % under oxidizing conditions and achieves 

almost 0.6 % when p(O2) is reduced from 0.21 atm down to 10
-18 - 10-12 atm (Table 4.9).

L0 is the length at the same temperature and atmospheric oxygen pressure.  

 

Considering the compositional influence on the expansion behaviour, one should account for 

possible differences in the equilibration degree of the ceramics. The cation ratio in A-sublattice significantly 

affects the kinetics of achieving the steady-state properties upon variations of p(O2) or temperature; selected 

examples are shown in Fig. 4.25. No equilibrium value of the relative elongation or total conductivity was 

attained for cation-deficient La-enriched perovskites (x = 0.15 - 0.25) during a reasonable time period. This 

situation is opposite to the behaviour of the compositions with lower concentrations of La cations or cation-

stoichiometric materials, as shown in Fig. 4.26. 

Possible origins of such a behavior might primarily relate to the phase transition upon extensive 

oxygen losses shown by the materials with enhanced La content. As shown in numerous studies [619-621], 

structural transformations are generally accompanied by a slow lattice recombination with prolonged time 

scale. Moreover, the presence of high amounts of La cations may induce generation of Mn3+/2+ and/or Ti4+/3+ 

redox couples causing a slower diffusion due to defect interactions. One should not also exclude the effects 

associated with possible oxygen overstoichiometry. As discussed in Chapters 1.3, 1.5, La-enriched 

manganites have a tendency towards formation of cation vacancies, while (Sr,La)TiO3±? may incorporate 

excessive oxygen be generation of Sr-O planes between perovskite-like blocks. Both effects are promoted by 

higher La content and oxidative conditions [300, 406, 407, 541] and lead to slow equilibration kinetics, 

which causes large scattering between experimental data [105, 300, 322, 407].

of the relative elongations of La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? 
ceramics in air (A) and CO - CO2 (B). L0’ is the initial 
length at room temperature in air 

 
 

To some extent, similar phenomena might be expected for (La,Sr)Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? with high La 

amount. For example, assuming that no Mn2+ or Ti3+ species are formed in atmospheric air and suggesting 

the phase purity of the compositions (as shown by XRD analysis), the perovskites 

(La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3±? and (La0.85Sr0.15)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3±? should accommodate at least 3.05 and 3.1 

oxygen atoms per perovskite formula unit. Even if the perovskite structure does not favour an excessive 

oxygen content (for example, by generation of low-valent Mn or Ti species), the oxygen deficiency and 

resultant oxygen diffusivity are expected to be minimum for La-enriched materials which also yields a 

hindered equilibration of the corresponding perovskites. 



182 
 

One should note that preliminary maintenance of the ceramic material at elevated temperatures with 

subsequent cooling basically accelerates the equilibration processes at lower temperatures, as shown in Fig. 

4.25. Although the kinetic factors may affect the general trends in the expansion behaviour as a function of 

the perovskite composition, it should be separately stressed that the overall level of thermal- and chemical-

induced strains, observed in the wide range of temperature and oxygen partial pressure, is still moderate and 

the title materials are thermomechanically compatible with various solid oxide electrolytes, such as stabilized 

zirconia, CGO, or LSGM [227, 580, 581, 587]. 

 

4.2.3. Electronic transport 

 

As shown in Fig. 4.27, introduction of acceptor-type Sr2+ into (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? increases 

the electronic conductivity, in accordance with the p-type charge transfer mechanism, typical for related 

compositions. For the compositions with x = 0.15 - 0.65, the activation energies are quite similar, varying in 

a narrow range 29 - 37 kJ/mol at 473 - 1283 K, whilst the Ea of (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? is lower, 15 - 16 

kJ/mol. (Table 4.10). The latter composition exhibits substantially higher values of the conductivity than the 

other materials. As discussed in Chapter 3.1.4, such difference in the transport behaviour may indicate a 

tendency to the transition from small-polaron hopping to broad-band conduction mechanism, caused by 

rising Mn4+ concentration and accompanied by lowering activation energy for the electronic charge carrier 

mobility. However, the absolute values of the Seebeck coefficient of (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? (Figs. 4.28 

- 4.30) cannot provide a supporting evidence for such hypothesis. 

Regardless of the microscopic mechanisms, the electrical properties of (La,Sr)Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? 

perovskites are essentially independent of the oxygen chemical potential in oxidizing and moderately 

reducing atmospheres (Fig. 4.28), thus indicating that the oxygen stoichiometry changes in these 

environments are very minor. Further reduction induces enhanced oxygen deficiency, which results in higher 

Seebeck coefficient and lower conductivity, as shown in Figs. 4.29 and 4.30.

The trends in the transport-ralated parameters of (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? observable upon p(O2) 

and temperature variations are similar to those of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? and doped chromites 

providing another argument in favour of dominant p-type electronic transport. The variations of the 

conductivity and thermopower are accompanied with strong hystereses on redox cycling (Fig. 4.31), with an 

apparently irreversible behavior for the La-rich materials. The irreversibility was attributed mainly to the 

microcrack formation detected on pos-tested samples visually and by optical microscopy inspections; 

however, kinetics of the orthorhombic - rhombohedral transition, defect reactions involving Mn3+/2+ and/or 

Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couples or processes associated with participation of the cation vacancies or ordered structures 

might also be relevant in the present case. The irreversible drop of the conductivity and mechanical 

instability restrict the choice of anode material towards the compositions with a modest (&lt;50%) La content. 

Another peculiarity of the transport behavior of (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? is that increasing Sr 

amount lowers the thermopower down to negative values. For the compositions with intermediate Sr content, 

when the average oxidation state of manganese cations is close to 3+, the Seebeck coefficient is expected to 

be close to zero (Fig. 4.28). If the interaction between Mn3+/4+, Mn3+/2+, and Ti4+/3+ states is strong enough and 

one type of the electronic charge carriers prevails, the latter situation may take place when the charge carrier 

concentration corresponds to approximately half of the density of states. In such case, increasing the fraction 

of Mn4+ compensating large Sr2+ additions leads to the hole concentration above 50% sites available for their 

location, shifting the Seebeck coefficient down to negative values; increasing La3+ concentration has the 

opposite effect.

From a theoretical point of view, an ideal situation in this case could be expected for parent 

stoichiometric La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? where the level of thermopower should be primarily determined by the 

parameters independent of the charge carrier concentration, such as transported heat. For the related 

compositions with similar La3+ and Sr2+ concentrations, an analogous behavior may appear if the deviations 

from ideal [La]/[Sr]=1 ratio are charge compensated by ionic point defects, namely, cation or oxygen 

vacancies, as for (La,Sr)MnO3±? with modest strontium content [300, 303]. Such assumptions may explain 

the fact that the nearly zero thermopower values are observed for the compositions with intermediate Sr2+ 

concentrations, particularly for (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3±? and (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3±? (Fig. 4.28), 

with presumably negligible concentration of vacancies (&lt;0.05 - 0.06 per perovskite formula lattice). In the 

case of charge compensation via the cation vacancy formation, this level of nonstoichiometry may still be 

tolerated by the perovskite lattice. Although the electronic conduction of these materials slightly increases 

with Sr content, the overall level of the conductivity is similar for both compositions (Figs. 4.27, 4.28), in 

contrast to (La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? and (La0.85Sr0.15)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3±?. 

Finally, one should mention that the experimentally observed trends cannot completely exclude 

more complex mechanisms when several types of the electronic charge carriers may be present and low 

absolute values of the Seebeck coefficient correspond to comparable contributions of the p- and n-type 

charge carriers, i.e. tp?p ? tn?n where t is the transference number. However, no indication of significant n-

type contribution can be identified from the conductivity dependencies on oxygen partial pressure and cation 

composition.

4.2.4. Oxygen permeability and isotope diffusion studies 

 

Measurements of the oxygen permeability through dense membranes (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? 

demonstrated a dominant limiting effect of the oxygen surface exchange kinetics; any estimation of the bulk 

ionic conductivity was impossible. A similar behavior has earlier been observed for dense (La1-xSrx)1-yMnO3-? 

ceramics with x = 0.4 - 0.6 [622]. For example, Fig. 4.32 displays the data on oxygen permeation fluxes 

through (La0.35Sr0.65)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? membranes with different thicknesses as a function of the oxygen 

partial pressure gradient expressed via the (p2/p1) ratio, where p1 and p2 are the oxygen pressures at the 

membrane permeate and feed sides, respectively. The oxygen fluxes are essentially equal for the 0.60- and 

1.00-mm thick ceramics within the limits of experimental error. This tendency unambiguously indicates that 

oxygen transport is governed by the surface exchange rate, on the contrary to (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-

xTixO3-? system where the contributions of interfacial exchange and bulk ionic conduction are significant. 

While the behavior of the Cr-containing perovskites made it possible to detect a significant impact 

of the grain boundary diffusion, no similar conclusions can be drawn for the title system, although the grain 

boundary mechanism of ionic transport should not be a priori neglected. In particular, the steady-state 

permeation fluxes through dense (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? membranes are, in fact, quite similar to one 

another due to very low oxygen nonstoichiometry (Fig. 4.33). In these conditions, the role of grain boundary 

diffusion is expected to increase as for lanthanum manganite [336, 339]. The low oxygen vacancy 

concentration is also responsible for relatively large scattering in the experimental data. Nevertheless, the 

oxygen permeability of (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? tends to increase with increasing Sr amount, in correlation 

with the oxygen nonstoichiometry variations revealed by the chemical expansion measurements. 

The permeation fluxes through (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? ceramics are lower compared to SrMnO3-

based phases, such as Sr0.7Ce0.3MnO3-? [320, 605], where the oxygen deficiency is substantially higher (Fig. 

4.34). The apparent activation energies (Table 4.11) are high, typical for the perovskite compounds with 

almost stoichiometric oxygen sublattice when the Ea values comprise a large vacancy formation enthalpy 

contribution [623].

The results of the isotopic exchange experiments performed in the Institute of Solid State Chemistry 

RAS, Chernogolovka, for A-site cation stoichiometric La1-xSrxMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? are summarized in Fig. 4.35. In 

agreement with the oxygen permeation data, the tracer diffusion coefficients in La0.6Sr0.4Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? and 

La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? are very similar to one another, whereas the surface exchange coefficients tend to 



188 
 

increase with acceptor content. The values of D* are lower even with respect to lanthanum-strontium 

manganites, suggesting that the oxygen anions located near Ti4+ are essentially excluded from the migration 

processes. This assumption is consistent with slower ionic transport in titanates or titanate-doped perovskites, 

as discussed in Chapter 1.5. If compared to oxygen-deficient Sr0.75Y0.25Mn0.5Co0.5O3-? [624] and oxygen-

hyperstoichiometric Pr2CuO4+? [625], the difference in the oxygen diffusivity at atmospheric p(O2) is up to 

five to eight orders of magnitude. Regardless of the relevant microscopic mechanisms, this level of oxygen 

ionic transport is insufficient to expect any substantial enhancement of the catalytically-active reaction zone 

due to a contribution of the electrode bulk diffusion into the electrochemical processes.

4.2.5. Electrode behaviour 

 
Summarizing the behaviour of perovskite-type (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-?, one should stress that the 

chemical and thermal expansion increases with increasing Sr content (Figs. 4.23, 4.24; Tables 4.8, 4.9). The 

same trend was observed for electronic conduction in oxidizing atmospheres, whereas under reducing 



189 
 

conditions the total conductivity values are essentially similar in the entire compositional range studied in 

this work (Figs. 4.29, 4.30). The La-rich materials such as (La0.85Sr0.15)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? exhibit smaller 

oxygen nonstoichiometry variations on reduction and, thus, a more pronounced tendency to p(O2)-

independent  concentration of the electronic charge carriers and conductivity at temperatures below 1100 K 

(Fig. 4.30C); however, their reduction is accompanied with strong and apparently irreversible hysteresis 

phenomena (Fig. 4.31). Although the ionic transport parameters, including the oxygen permeability and 

surface exchange rate, tend to increase with x (Figs. 4.33, 4.34), the overall level of the ionic conduction is 

low and no significant influence on the electrode performance may be expected due to minor variations in the 

these parameters. With respect to the compositional trends in the functional characteristics, the compositions 

with intermediate strontium concentrations (x = 0.4 - 0.6) seem to provide an optimum combination of the 

electronic transport and thermomechanical properties. 

As will be demonstrated in Chapter 5.3.2, anodes based on cation-deficient 

(La0.85Sr0.15)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? exhibit a strong tendency towards densification and require specific preparation 

procedure in order to achieve an adequate porosity and provide a good adhesion to the electrolyte. Moreover, 

the values of the overpotential are still high for the title anode, presumably due to the microstructural factors. 

Therefore, the electrochemical studies were carried out on La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? anode which may 

be considered as a compromise composition which reasonably satisfies the requirements in terms of the 

stability, transport and thermomechanical properties. The electrode layers La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? exhibit 

homogeneous porous microstructures where submicron grain size is preserved (Fig. 4.36). No essential 

microstructural changes were observed after electrochemical testing. 

Figs. 4.37 and 4.38 illustrate the behaviour of porous La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? electrode layers applied 

onto LSGM at 873 - 1073 K in H2-containing atmosphere. Analogously to the (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-

xTixO3-? electrodes, the rate-determining steps should be related to the electrode surface; the key factors 

limiting anodic performance are expected to include the interfacial exchange kinetics and electronic 

conduction. One argument in favour of the non-negligible role of the electronic transport is that the activation 

energy for electrode conductivity (Fig. 4.38) is significatly lower than Ea values for oxygen permeability, 

diffusion, and surface exchange (Table 4.11).

Whatever the electrode reaction mechanism, the electrochemical activity of La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? 

anode layers appears significantly better than that of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? [10] and is close to that of 

Mn-free (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Fe0.4Cr0.6O3-? anodes with similar microstructures. Considering the negative effects 

associated with the presence of chromium in SOFCs, namely, volatilization of chromium oxides and 

formation of Cr6+-containing phases in oxidizing conditions at low temperatures, La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? and 

its analogues provide significant advantages with respect to the LaCrO3-based electrode materials. The 

anodic overpotentials of La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? are, however, still high in comparison with the Ni-containing 

cermets, thus making it necessary to incorporate the metallic and, possibly, catalytically active components in 

(La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? based anodes. 

 
 

4.3. Concluding remarks 

 

Studies on (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? and SrMn1-xNbxO3-? perovskites showed that the stabilization 

of the single phase manganites at low p(O2) is an achievable task, although requires comparatively high (up 

to 50%) amount of high-valent dopant to avoid phase decomposition. One of important features of doped 

manganites relates to possible structural transformations on thermal or redox cycling, accompanied by slow 

equilibration kinetics, mechanical failure due to large volume changes, hysteresis phenomena on redox 

cycling, in some cases resulting in irreversible degradation of the functional characteristics, etc. Such a 

behaviour was especially pronounced for donor-rich (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? and CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-?. On the 

other hand, these effects may be avoided or suppressed by appropriate selection of the composition; in 



191 
 

particular, a relatively rapid equilibration was observed for La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? and SrMn1-xNbxO3-? 

ceramic samples. 

The expansivity of SrMn1-xNbxO3-? (x = 0.4 - 0.5) and (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? is moderate and is 

strongly influenced by chemical contribution arising due to oxygen nonstoichiometry variations. The 

chemical expansion of (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? under reducing conditions is below 0.6% and diminishes on 

appropriate La-doping into the perovskite. 

Donor doping into the title perovskites reduces the concentration of p-type electronic charge 

carriers. Moreover, for SrMn1-xNbxO3-? introduction of Nb into B-sublattice negatively influences the 

mobility of the charge carriers; both factors result in suppressed electronic conductivity upon La or Nb-

doping. At the same time, under anode environments, the compositional effect on the electronic transport is 

less critical which enables to optimize other functional characteristics without substantial degradation of the 

electronic transport. Taking into account the low values of the conductivity at high p(O2), La-enriched (La1-

xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? and SrMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? are inappropriate for cathode applications. Considering the 

behaviour of CaMn0.5Nb0.5O3-? perovskite, this material can hardly be considered as a component of SOFC 

anodes or cathodes, due to insufficient stability even under moderately reducing atmospheres, low electronic 

conductivity, large variations of the TEC upon thermal cycling and a strong tendency towards the hysteresis 

behavior and slow equilibration. 

The ionic transport parameters for heavily-doped manganites are rather low to ensure any 

substantial enlargement of the electrochemically-active zone and seem to correlate with Mn content in the 

perovskite. This effect may relate to facilitated Mn reducibility, in particular to a higher flexibility of Mn 

cations towards changes in the oxygen coordination which enables higher oxygen deficiency in the 

perovskite structure or promotion of the surface processes by Mn species. Another origin might relate to a 

negative influence of Ti or Nb species on the oxygen ionic diffusion, in particular by stabilization of oxygen 

atoms in the vicinity of the donor cation excluding O2- from the transport mechanism. 

Due to an acceptable combination of the phase and structural stability, transport and 

thermomechanical properties as well as microstructural behaviour, the anodes composed of 

La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? yield the polarization resistance as low as 1.5 - 2.0 Ohm×cm
2 at 1073 K without a 

specific anode modification. The level of the electrochemical activity is comparable with that of 

(La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? and (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? (x = 0.3 - 0.4), while the title composition 

may be advantageous over the chromites in terms of the absence of chromium cations having the tendency 

towards generation of Cr6+ species or formation of volatile compounds with subsequent degradation of the 

electrode characteristics upon thermal/redox cycling. However, further studies, primarily in terms of the 

performance stability, are required for all the electrodes studied in order to evaluate the applicability of the 

materials in SOFC technology.

Chapter 5. Major trends and factors relevant for the SOFC anode performance 

 

In Chapters 3 - 4, selected chromite, manganite and titanate-based groups of anode materials were 

characterized in terms of their functional properties and general compositional trends observed in the 

electrode performance. The present part is devoted to comparative studies of the electrochemical properties 

of the perovskite-like and selected cermet anodes, elucidation of the basic factors affecting the electrode 

behaviour and search of possible routes to optimize the anode activity. 

For fabrication of the electrochemical cells operated in the intermediate temperature range (873 - 

1073 K), two types of solid electrolyte materials were selected, namely, (La0.9Sr0.1)0.98Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-? (LSGM) 

and La10Si5AlO26.5. The choice of ionic conductors and the particular cation compositions was based on the 

combination of optimum functional characteristics, primarily in terms of the transport properties, stability 

under the operation conditions and availability of the precursor materials. 

Considering other widely used families of solid electrolytes, zirconia-based solid solutions possess a 

negligible level of the electronic conductivity, beneficial for the electrolyte application. However, the level of 

the ionic conductivity in these oxides is 1 - 2 orders lower in comparison with other candidates, such as 

LSGM, La9.33Si6O26- or CeO2-based oxides, which makes YSZ more appropriate for applications at higher 

temperatures rather than in IT-SOFCs. Moreover, some concerns are related with the chemical compatibility 

of doped ZrO2 with compositions enriched with rare-earth or alkali-earth cations [30, 329, 626, 627]. Doped 

ceria suffer from excitation of non-negligible electronic transport and large expansion under reducing 

conditions, especially promoted by dissolution of transition metal cations penetrated from the electrode phase 

[5, 30, 237]. This problem imposes severe requirements on the temperature range of applications of CeO2-

based compositions. On the other hand, CeO2-? and its derivatives may be successfully utilized as 

components of the electrode materials or as protective layers between the electrolyte and electrodes. 

Lanthanum gallate-based materials seem to be more appropriate for electrolyte applications in the 

intermediate temperature range in terms of the transport and thermomechanical properties. As discussed 

below, apatite-type silicates show a worse combination of the functional characteristics, especially in terms 

of poor stability. However, the availability and low price of the precursor materials as well as large doping 

possibilities which may to some extent enable to overcome or reduce the concerns indicated also make these 

materials attractive for further studies. This chapter is devoted to comparative overview of the stability and 

transport characteristics of LaGaO3- and La9.33Si6O26-based materials and evaluation of the electrode 

performance of perovskite-like and cermet anodes in contact with the corresponding electrolytes. 

 
5.1. Applicability of lanthanum silicate- and lanthanum gallate-based materials as solid 

electrolytes: a brief overview. 
 
5.1.1. Stability, transport and thermomechanical properites 

 

As discussed in previous sectons, the electrochemical behavior is strongly influenced by the 

transport properties and stability of the electrolyte as well as by its compatibility with the electrode material, 

sublayer or other SOFC components. Therefore, analysis of the electrode properties should involve 



193 
 

consideration of the available data on the oxygen ionic conductivity and long-term behavior of gallate- and 

silicate-based solid electrolytes. 

Temperature dependencies of the total conductivity of selected LaGaO3-based materials in air or 

moderately reducing atmospheres are presented in Fig. 5.1. Typical for perovskite-type compositions, oxygen 

vacancies are the dominant ionic charge carriers and the transport properties may be modified by an 

appropriate acceptor-type doping. The largest conductivity was found for compositions containing La3+ and 

Sr2+ cations in A-sublattice, due to minimum lattice strains favorable to the oxygen diffusion [628 - 630]. 

Among B-site dopants, the maximum ionic transfer was achieved by introduction of an appropriate quantity 

of 2-fold charged cations (Mg, Co, Fe), due to ensuring a substantial amount and fast mobility of oxygen 

vacancies [629, 631, 632]. In (La,Sr)(Ga,Mg)O3-? series, the largest values of the ionic conductivity were 

obtained for 10 - 20% of Sr and 15 - 20% of Mg which amounted to 0.10 - 0.17 S/cm at 1073 K with the 

activation energy of 90 - 110 kJ/mol [581, 629, 631-634]. For comparison, the conductivity of (Zr,Y)O2-? 

oxides varies in the range (5 - 8)×10-2 S/cm at 1073 K [30, 626]. Further addition of the acceptor-type cations 

into LSGM induces vacancy ordering [635, 636]. The perovskite structure of gallates allows a slight (up to 

~2%) A-site cation deficiency; exceeding the limit substantially deteriorates the transport properties [581, 

637]. The content of the transition metal cations in B-sublattice should be restricted by 3 - 7% in order to 

avoid the drop of the ionic conductivity, contribution of the electronic transport or thermomechanical 

problems ([30] and references cited).

Analogously with numerous ionic conductors and semiconductors, the functional properties of 

LSGM are affected by sintering procedure, in particular by the ceramics microstructure and formation of 



194 
 

secondary phases (La2O3, LaSrGaO4, Sr3Ga2O6 etc.) at the grain boundaries or on the surface. As shown in 

[581], the presence of the secondary phases as well as an enrichment of the grain boundaries with Sr and Mg 

may have a hampering effect on the oxygen ionic conductivity and promote the electronic contribution. 

Nevertheless, the electronic transference numbers in LSGM and related materials do not exceed 0.02, as 

shown in Table 5.1, which may be considered to be acceptable for utilization this group of materials as solid 

electrolytes. Increasing the sintering time ensures nearly complete dissolution of the impurities in the 

perovskite structure; another approach to bind the secondary phases and diminish their negative effects 

relates to introduction of scavenging agents [478].

In apatite-type La9.33Si6O26 and its derivatives, the dominant charge carries are interstitial oxygen 

atoms [580, 585, 638]. An alternative mechanism taking place in oxygen-deficient representatives and 

involving the transport of oxygen vacancies proceeds much slower [585, 639]. Therefore, the transport 

properties are promoted by doping strategies leading to formation of overstoichiometric oxygen in 

comparison with the parent silicate, i.e. by introducing the cations stable in high oxidation state. On the other 

hand, excessive La or Si content complicates formation of single-phase materials and ceramics densification, 



195 
 

deteriorates the stability, especially in reducing and/or wet atmospheres, induces volatilization of silica 

species, etc. As a result, the optimum ionic conductivity was found for apatites slightly substituted in B-

sublattice and/or possessing a moderate La excess in comparison with the parent composition (Fig. 5.2) [580, 

641, 642]. Selected studies have been carried out on germanate-based analogues, but their applicability is 

limited by high costs and volatilization of GeO2, tendency towards formation of glassy phase and a phase 

transition at 1000 - 1100 K shown by lanthanum germanate on heating in air [641, 642]. 

Promotion of the ionic transport in La9.33Si6O26 was observed by introducing Al, Fe, Mg cations into 

the apatite lattice, accompanied by a decrease of the corresponding activation energy attributable to 

formation of a new conduction path due to reduced bonding energy of the metal with oxygen [23, 640, 641]. 

An increase of the ionic transport was also observed for Nb-doped silicates, due to increasing the amount of 

the charge carriers with simultaneous preservation of the single phase composition [24].

conductivity of selected apatite-type silicate and 
germanate compositions in air 

 
 
The electronic contribution into the overall conductivity of the apatites basically correlates with 

generation of excessive oxygen atoms and increases with Al or Fe introduction. This phenomenon is 

attributed to localization of the electronic defects in the vicinity of the lattice defects with the opposite 

charge, i.e. oxygen interstitials [580]. The electronic transference numbers in apatites are within 0.01, as 

shown in Table 5.1. 

One of most significant concerns related to both electrolyte materials is associated with insufficient 

stability towards operation atmospheres and compatibility with other cell components. For LSGM, the main 

problem is associated with volatilization of gallium oxides and oxyhydroxides, especially pronounced under 

reducing or wet atmospheres. For cation stoichiometric perovskites, Ga losses may lead to generation of 

La2O3, LaSrGaO4 and other phases enriched with A-cations. Subsequent exposure of La2O3 to H2O or CO2-



196 
 

containing atmosphere induces formation of hydroxides or carbonates, with resultant deterioration of the 

transport properties and degradation of the mechanical integrity. Any contact of LSGM with Pt promotes the 

depletion of the electrolyte with Ga, due to formation of intermetallic Ga-Pt compounds [633, 637, 581]. 

In order to avoid separation of the La- or Sr-enriched impurities, a particular interest has been drawn 

by A-site cation deficient gallates, although an excess of Ga in the perovskite lattice may accelerate the 

vaporization-related processes. The phenomena indicated impose requirements on the electrolyte processing 

conditions. On the other hand, LSGM-based materials do not suffer from essential ageing phenomena in the 

intermediate temperature range, in contrast to zirconia electrolytes [647]. 

The literature reports on the stability of the apatite-based compounds are contradictory. In particular, 

a stable conductivity was detected in wet Ar [640], 20% H2 [648], wet H2 and wet CO2 [649]. However, these 

results relate to comparatively low temperatures, up to 1073 K, while the testing time was limited by 50 - 70 

hours. In contrast, long maintaining (1000 hours) of La9.77Si6O26.655 and La10Si6O27 at 1073 K in air resulted 

in ~5% drop of the conductivity [650], while increasing the operation temperature up to 1173 K revealed 

~20% degradation of the total conductivity after 350 hours of reduction of La10Si5AlO26.5 at p(O2) ? 10
-18 atm 

[21]. Possible origins of the degradation observed seem to be associated with segregation or volatilization of 

SiO2 which is accompanied by formation of La2O3-based compositions. The separation of the secondary 

phases deteriorates the transport properties and affects the mechanical integrity of the ceramics. While in the 

temperature range corresponding to the working conditions of the electrochemical cell the stability seems to 

be sufficient, any necessity to elevate the ambient temperature (i.e. during the process of the cell preparation 

or sealing) is detrimental for the functional characteristics of the electrolyte material. Taking into account the 

reactivity and strong cation interdiffusion between the apatite phase and numerous electrode materials, as 

discussed below, the issue of the chemical stability is the most critical limitation for the high-temperature 

application of lanthanum silicate-based materials. 

 

 

5.1.2. Performance of electrochemical cells composed of gallate- and silicate-based 

electrolytes 
 

Reviewing the data on the electrochemical performance gallate-based electrochemical cells, one 

should mention that the basic limitations are associated with the electrode materials rather than with the 

gallate phase or relate to the problems of the chemical compatibility between the components. As a 

confirmation of the good applicability of LSGM for the electrochemical utilizations, the polarization 

resistance of the cathodes and anodes in contact with this electrolyte series may be reduced below 0.1 - 0.5 

Ohm×cm2; examples will be presented in following sections. Promising performances have been obtained for 

manganite- [651], ferrite- [652], nickelate- [593, 594] and especially cobaltite-based [9, 278, 653] cathodes. 

Among anodes, acceptable characteristics have been obtained for both conventional cermets [567, 654, 655] 

and for alternative materials [15, 18, 264, 547, 556]. A reasonable activity towards electrochemical oxidation 

of hydrocarbon- [116, 230], ethanol- [408], H2S-containing [116] fuels was observed for cells with LSGM 

electrolyte. Acceptable performance was obtained utilizing composite electrodes with gallate-based materials 



197 
 

as ionic-conductive components [651, 654], although in this case the issue of the phase interaction becomes 

critical. One should note that most promising results were collected on the cells containing protective layers 

between LSGM and electrodes in order to avoid the interaction between the components. 

Due to comparatively short period of studies of the apatite-based electrochemical cells and because 

of their poor performance, the amount of available data on the polarization characteristics of electrodes in 

contact with lanthanum silicates is extremely few. Among the data reported one may note the results obtained 

for Ni - CGO, Sr2MgMoO6-?, La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? anodes as well as for La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-? and 

La0.7Sr0.3FeO3-? cathodes on La10Si5.5Al0.5O26.75 showing the area-specific resistance (ASR) in the range of 0.5 

- 1.0 Ohm×cm2 at 1073 K, while for La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-?, the corresponding value was obtained as low as 

0.04 Ohm×cm2 [566]. Acceptable performance of the electrodes listed basically necessitates the presence of 

the buffer layer. One should emphasize that all the electrodes studied were covered with Pt ink. A 

comparable level of the electrode activity was obtained for platinum or (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-?-based cathodes 

deposited onto La9.8Ge5.5Al0.5O26.45 [656]. 

La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-? and La0.6Sr0.4Co1-xFexO3-? cathodes in contact with La10Si5.8Al0.2O26.9 showed the R? 

in the range of 0.3 - 1.8 Ohm×cm2 without any specific optimization, while subsequent introduction of Ag 

particles by wet impregnation reduced the polarization resistance down to 0.08 Ohm×cm2 [657]. A cell with 

La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-? cathode, La9.62Si5.79Al0.21O26.33 electrolyte and Ni - CGO anode showed the power 

density of 250 mW/cm2 at 1073 K [658] which seems to be rather promising taking into account the 

comparatively thick (720 µ m) electrolyte thickness. 

On the other hand, conventional anode and cathode materials without any specific modification 

(which may be too expensive and unreasonable for practical applications) showed extremely large 

polarization resistances, exceeding 100 - 1000 Ohm×cm2 [659-661]. Moreover, many electrochemical cells 

showed a fast and irreversible degradation of the electrode performance which is not surprising taking into 

account the drop of the total conductivity shown by lanthanum silicates at elevated temperature and strong 

susceptibility of most electrochemically-active materials towards contamination with silica. Poor electrode 

characteristics have been found for metal-apatite cermet composites [661], although fabrication of similar 

composites with other ionic conductors has been found to be beneficial. This, in particular, demonstrates the 

absence or negligible contribution of any catalytic effect from the silicate-based phases into the 

electrochemical process. 

As shown from the examples, the information on the performance of apatite-containing 

electrochemical cells is contradictive. Taking into account a poor availability of the experimental results on 

the anode activity collected from silicate-based cells, more studies on the electrode activity of layers coated 

onto the apatite-based electrolytes are required in order to clarify their potential for electrochemical 

applications. The following parts are focused on studying the basic factors responsible for the electrode 

performance of perovskite-type and cermet anode materials deposited onto apatite-type La10Si5AlO26.5. A 

particular attention is drawn to the interaction/interdiffusion phenomena and performance degradation. As no 

special steps were undertaken to modify the electrochemical properties, the polarization values are expected 

to be rather high, and the work has primarily an investigating nature. 



198 
 

5.2. Electrochemical activity of cermet anodes deposited onto lanthanum silicate-based 

solid electrolyte 
 

Composite powders consisting of electronic and ionic conducting components (basically, metallic 

and solid electrolyte phases) are the most studied and widely used materials for SOFC anodes, although the 

corresponding electrode layers may have some disadvantages in comparison with MIEC anodes, primarily in 

terms of stringent requirements to their microstructure [1, 2, 7, 662, 663]. Ni is one of the most common 

components in cermets, although its content should be moderate in order to avoid the problems associated 

with the sintering of the metallic particles, formation of volatile compounds, large volume changes on redox 

cycling or anode contamination in C- or S-containing fuels ([1, 7, 266] and references cited). 

The present part is devoted to studies of selected cermet anodes in contact with La10Si5AlO26.5 

electrolyte. One of particular tasks relates to partial or complete replacement of Ni with other metals without 

a loss of the electrochemical performance. The technique of preparation of the electrode layers is described in 

Table 2.5. 

SEM analysis carried out on as-prepared half-cells or those after the electrochemical tests revealed 

an acceptable porosity of the electrode layers and satisfactory connectivity between the cermet electrodes and 

electrolyte (Fig. 5.3). The thickness of the electrode layers varied in the range 15 - 40 µ m. Particles of 

CGO20 phase showed a tendency towards formation of large agglomerates (up to 10 - 20 µ m); nevertheless, 

the porosity was preserved, although the TPB length might be substantially affected by the poor dispersion. 

The presence of silver in the anode composition yielded generation of 5 - 10 µ m sphere-like domains as 

shown in Fig. 5.3 C.

Selected results on the polarization behaviour of the cermet anode layers in contact with apatite are 

shown in Table 5.2 and Figs. 5.4, 5.5. The electrochemical performance of the anodes is poor; the 

corresponding polarization resistances vary in the range 2 - 20 Ohm×cm2, which is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude 

larger than required for an adequate operation of a SOFC.

In the present work and in [661] Pt mesh was used as current collector. The anode layers in [566, 656] were 

covered with Pt ink.  
 
 
The phenomena taking place at the interface anode/electrolyte were qualitatively studied by EDS 

analysis carried out on fractured half-cells in the regions in the vicinity of the contact between the phases. 

Selected results collected for Cu - CGO20 and Ag - Ni - CGO20 anode layers are presented in Fig. 5.6 and 

Tables 5.3, 5.4. Diffusion of La into the cermet, which might be promoted by the apatite phase 

decomposition, is clearly observable in Fig. 5.6, although the elemental distribution over the anode layer is 

non-obvious, due to small amount of the contaminant and poor resolution of the technique. Penetration of 

rare-earth cations from the respective silicates or gallates into the electrodes has been observed in former 

studies [566, 591]. In the present case, La species might primarily dissolve in fluorite with deterioration of 

the transport properties and electrochemical activity in comparison with (Ce,Gd)O2-? phases [88, 664, 665].

In turn, the electrolyte layers in the vicinity of the electrode exhibit an accumulation of Ce species, 

presumably penetrated from the anode, and depletion with Si and Al attributable to diffusion and/or 

vaporization of the corresponding species; the degree of the changes n the elemental composition correlates 

with the distance from the electrolyte surface (Table 5.3). The resultant deficiency in Si and Al in the apatite 

promotes the separation of La2O3, with subsequent degradation of the electrolyte transport properties, 

electrochemical activity of the anode, adhesion between the layers, etc.

As shown in Table 5.4, the relative amounts of Si and La species in Cu - CGO20 layer gradually 

increases on approaching to the interface, indicating their accumulation at the interface and further 

penetration of into the anode phase. Despite the apparently low concentration, the presence of silica is 

detrimental for the electrochemical properties, as indicated in [566, 591, 594]. One should note that the EDS 

analysis was carried out on half-cells subjected to a single annealing at 1200 - 1300 K in air and one might 

expect more substantial diffusion or interaction between the cell components even after a short (5 - 10 hours) 

measurement procedure. Another notion is that the results of EDS analysis do not demonstrate the actual 

amount of the elements and may be considered only for comparative studies provided that the collection of 

the data was carried out under similar scanning conditions. In particular, the technique used has a various 

sensitivity towards light and heavy elements which might infer large deviations in comparison with their 

absolute content. 

In order to bind SiO2 species in the anode, La2O3 phase was introduced into Ni - 8YSZ - CGO20 

anode layer by wet impregnation of lanthanum nitrate followed by its subsequent decomposition; however, 

this approach did not allow to achieve a reasonable performance (Fig. 5.4), possibly due to blocking of the 

electrochemically active sites, hindering the gas diffusion with lanthanum oxide/silicate formed or negative 

influence of excessive La amounts in terms of the dissolution in CGO20 phase. 

Comparing the performance of the cermet anodes on the apatite-based cells with literature data 

presented in Table 5.2, the level of the polarization resistances obtained in the present work is significantly 

lower in comparison with Ni - La9SrSi6O26.5 cermet (&gt;1 kOhm×cm
2 at 1023 K) [661] but is worse than that of 

Ni - CGO20 (70-30 wt.%) on La10Si5.5Al0.5O26.75 (0.59 Ohm×cm
2 at 1073 K) [566]. The better performance in 



202 
 

the latter reference might originate from differences in the electrode and electrolyte composition, fabrication 

procedure as well as application of Pt paste on the anode surface. 

A noticeable optimization of the anode properties was achieved by addition of silver into the 

cermets. In particular, moderate quantities of Ag in Ni - CGO20 anode were found to have a positive 

influence on the electrochemical characteristics (Fig. 5.5), possibly due to a better adhesion of the anode to 

the electrolyte and between the particles in the electrode layer which ensures a satisfactory percolation of the 

electron-conductive phase and extended TPB. The promotion of the electrode properties by introducing 

metallic silver has been demonstrated earlier on La0.5Sr0.4MnO3-? [666], La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-? [667] 

YBaCo4O7+? [668], La2Ni0.8Cu0.2O4+? [594], (La,Sr)(Cr,Mn)O3-? [10] cathodes as well as on cermet [669, 

670] or alternative anodes [367, 671]; the improvement was primarily attributed to enhanced electronic 

transport over the electrode layer and a contribution of Ag into the catalytic properties. 

As shown in Fig. 5.5, the optimum performance is achieved when the total amount of metallic phase 

is 10 - 20 vol. %; in particular, the polarization resistance of Ag - Ni - CGO (10 - 10 - 80 vol. %) electrode 

was found as low as ~2 Ohm×cm2 at 1073 K, substantially increasing under current. The activity may be 

further improved by distribution of submicron ceria particles over the anode layer using wet impregnation 

technique. However, increasing the content of CGO20 powder by mechanical mixing has a negative effect, 

indicating that apart from the composition of the anode layer, the activity is determined by microstructural 

peculiarities which depend on the preparation route. With respect to the presence of silver in the anode layer, 

excessive amounts of Ag result in formation of large agglomerates (Fig. 5.3) deteriorating the electrode 

porosity, while a volatility of Ag [28] sufficiently limits the operational temperature range of the anode. 

The presence of CGO20 in the cermet composition seems to be more beneficial in comparison with 

8YSZ in terms of the polarization behaviour. Although the literature data on the comparative electrocatalytic 

activity of ZrO2- or CeO2-based conventional Ni cermet anode on commonly used electrolytes (YSZ-, CGO- 

or LaGaO3-?-based compositions) are contradictory, the overall level of the performance of cermets 

containing doped ceria or zirconia may be considered to be comparable [1, 7, 266]. Therefore, the higher 

performance of Ni - CGO20 in the present work may be attributed to the difference in the preparation 

process, better electronic percolation in ceria-based anode under reducing conditions or to stronger 

degradation of zirconia phase in contact with silicates. As shown by previous studies, silica has a tendency 

towards accumulation at the grain boundaries of zirconia grains, dissolution in the fluorite structure or 

formation of ZrSiO4 phase, with resultant deterioration of the transport or mechanical properties [672-677]. 

In turn, segregation of La2O3 from the apatite may promote the interaction with ZrO2-based solutions forming 

zirconate phases with suppressed ionic conductivity [642]. All these factors result in a strong degradation of 

the conductivity and electrochemical activity of zirconia-containing electrodes applied onto the apatite 

electrolytes.   

In order to ensure a better adhesion between the electrode and electrolyte layers and provide 

electronic percolation through the anode, selected electrochemical cells were fabricated applying a layer of 

metallic silver onto the apatite surface prior to deposition of the electrode layer. The details of the preparation 

of the corresponding anodes are given in Table 2.6. Selected SEM micrographs collected from the anode 

layers or from the interface electrode/electrolyte are shown in Fig. 5.7.

As follows from the results of the electrochemical studies of the anodes with Ag layer presented in 

Figs. 5.8 and 5.9, the presence of continuous Ag layer allows to reduce the Ohmic drops, possibly due to a 

better percolation of the electron-conductive components in the anodes. The lower Ohmic resistance enables 

to increase the range of currents used for the polarization tests without applying high voltages across the cell.

On the other hand, the polarization resistance increases after application of the Ag layer (Fig. 5.8), 

possibly due to reduction of TPB by blocking with Ag particles or worse contact between the apatite and ion-

conductive phase in cermet with resultant deterioration of the oxygen exchange between the cell components. 

Although some oxygen and hydrogen permeability have been reported for pure Ag or Ag-containing alloys 

[678, 679], this level is obviously insufficient to provide an adequate performance of the anodes. 

More promising results were obtained after addition of Al2O3 to the electrode and subsequent 

impregnation with Ni (Fig. 5.9). Since alumina is not expected to demonstrate any contribution into the 

electronic/ionic transport or catalytic properties [26, 680] of the composites, the effect of Al2O3 might relate 

to formation of a mechanically-stable porous network, while the presence of Ag in the anode provides the 

connectivity between particles. 

The positive effect of application of Ag sublayer on the ohmic losses demonstrates that non-

modified cermet anode layers possess insufficient electronic conductivity to ensure a proper current 

collection, while the improvement of the performance after introduction of Al2O3 shows that the parent 

microstructure does not provide a sufficient gas access to the electrochemically active sites. Optimizing the 

fraction of the components might enable to achieve a reasonable porosity and large TPB. However, the 

values of the polarization resistance still remain rather high, which limits the applicability of Ag-containing 

electrode layers. 

Long-term performance tests carried out on Al2O3 - Ag - CGO20 cermet deposited onto 

La10Si5AlO26.5 electrolyte with Ag interlayer showed a continuous degradation of the polarization resistance 

under galvanostatic conditions which amounts to ~6% per 90 hours, although the data are rather scattered 

(Fig. 5.10). Even more serious deterioration was detected in terms of the Ohmic resistance; in particular, on 

initial 10 hours the degradation rate was essentially high, followed by somewhat lower, but still significant 

(~30% per 90 hours) increase of the Ohmic losses. The latter phenomenon might primarily be associated with 

reduction of the ionic conductivity of the apatite materials with time [21]; however, the degradation of the 

transport properties has been found to be negligible at the temperatures below 1073 K [648, 649].

205 
 

Other possible origins of the degradation include microstructural features (i.e. detachment of the 

electrode layer, electrode depletion with Ag due to vaporization, agglomeration of the metallic particles 

resulting in disruption of the electron-percolative network etc.) or accumulation of silica-based phases at the 

electrode/electrolyte interface, as confirmed by EDS analysis. All these factors lead to an increase of both 

polarization and ohmic resistance. 

Comparison of SEM micrographs of the Al2O3 - Ag - CGO20 electrode powders before and after the 

electrochemical tests (Fig. 5.7 C and D) does not allow to make certain conclusions on the changes in the 

cermet morphology, suggesting that the performance deterioration is related primarily with the 

electrode/electrolyte interface. 

Summarizing the results obtained on cermets anodes in contact with La10Si5AlO26.5 electrolyte, one 

may infer that a reasonable amount in the anode layer of Ni and/or Ag is required in order to achieve an 

adequate performance. However, both components impose requirements on the operation conditions, 

primarily in terms of microstructural features, phase stability, dimension behaviour etc. In order to evaluate 

the potential of silicate-based materials for utilization as SOFC electrolytes, the following investigation is 

focused on comparative studies of the electrochemical performance of perovskite anodes applied onto 

La10Si5AlO26.5 and LSGM electrolytes.

La10Si5AlO26.5 solid electrolytes 
 
 
5.3.1. Comparison of oxide-based anode materials. Correlations of the electrochemical 

behaviour and transport properties 

 
 

The basic trends of the structural, transport and thermomechanical properties of selected perovskite-

like oxide materials were considered in Chapters 3 - 4, with the primary attention towards the effect of the 

cation composition on the functional characteristics, mechanism of the electronic/ionic transport, 

equilibration kinetics, etc.  The present part is devoted to a brief summarization and comparison of the 

properties important for the electrochemical applications for the perovskites which exhibited the maximum 

potential for utilization as SOFC anodes.   

Analysis of XRD patterns under reducing atmospheres (Fig. 5.11) indicates that most perovskite 

materials may endure redox cycling in terms of the phase stability provided that a sufficient amount of 

cations with suppressed reducibility (Cr, Ti, Nb) is introduced into the perovskite structure. The presence of 

minor amounts of MnO phase which accompanies the reduction of manganite-based materials was 

demonstrated not to affect significantly the transport and electrochemical properties, while the segregation of 

nano-scaled Ni particles from (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? or (Mg,Ni)O secondary phase at low p(O2) 

may be beneficial in terms of the catalytic activity. Some precautions should be undertaken with respect to 

the structural transitions exhibited by La-enriched (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? and (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-?; in particular, a 



206 
 

slow equilibration kinetics and hysteresis behaviour observed on the former family of perovskites leads to 

mechanical degradation and limits their applicability in the electrochemical cells. 

 

 

Fig. 5.11. Selected XRD patterns of the oxide anode materials after equilibration in atmospheric air and after 
reduction. The annealing conditions in reducing atmospheres are given in the legends. 

 
 

For most studied materials the TEC values vary in the range (11 - 14)×10-6 K-1 at 923 - 1223 K (Fig. 

5.12) and the perovskites are mechanically compatible with LSGM and La10Si5AlO26.5 electrolytes. The 

compositional trends in the thermal expansivity generally correlate with the reducibility of the corresponding 

oxides; in particular, increasing strontium and manganese concentrations in the perovskite lattice yields 

moderately higher thermal expansion, although possible electron exchanges between the reducible species 

should also be accounted for. For SrMn1-xNbxO3-? series, the Nb content should exceed 20 - 30 % in order to 

avoid large expansion and decomposition of Mn-enriched representatives upon reduction. 

The isothermal chemically-induced strains of (La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-?, (La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-? and 

(La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-?-based compositions are within 0.6% on reducing p(O2) down to 10
-21 - 10-12 atm (Fig. 

5.13). Decreasing Sr content lowers the chemical expansion as well as TEC values and improves the 

thermomechanical compatibility with the electrolyte materials. However, even for Sr-enriched 

(La0.25Sr0.75)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? with maximum strains the chemical expansion of 0.6% is not a critical factor, as 

discussed in Chapter 3.1.3, which enables to modify the transport and electrochemical properties of this 

perovskite series without a compromise with the stability or thermomechanical compatibility.

The oxygen partial pressure dependencies of the total conductivity (Fig. 5.14) display similar trends 

for all studied materials. Namely, plateau-like behavior is observed under oxidizing conditions when the 

variations of the oxygen nonstoichiometry are minor, while the oxygen content is close to stoichiometric 

value. In accordance with the p-type electronic transport mechanism, in moderately reducing atmospheres the 

conductivity starts to drop with decreasing p(O2). As follows from the results of OP studies, the contribution 

of the ionic transport into the overall conductivity is negligible. The range of the oxygen partial pressures 

where the conductivity is essentially p(O2)-independent, expands on decreasing temperature as the oxygen 

nonstoichiometry variations decrease. In some cases, the conductivity at 1073 K is almost constant down to 

p(O2) = 10
-20 atm, though this behavior in the intermediate-temperature range may partly originate from 

kinetic factors. When considering the major effects of cation composition, it should first be mentioned that 

incorporation of B-site cations with relatively stable oxidation state, such as Ti or Nb, decreases the hole 

mobility and conductivity. Taking into account the trends in the stability and expansion behaviour, the 

optimum concentration of these species in the B-sublattice is within 40 - 60%. 

 



208

In accordance with previous studies [190, 195, 300], Sr-doping into the perovskites promotes the 

reducibility which is reflected by shifting the onset of the conductivity drop to more oxidative conditions. For 

(La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? series, La-doping reduces the amount of the electronic charge carries and 

simultaneously allows to extend the region of p(O2)-independent conductivity to more reductive 

atmospheres; the resultant effect is that La content has no essential influence of the low-p(O2) conductivity. 

The segregation of metallic nickel in reduced (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? has no substantial effect on 

the transport properties as Ni content is small; the total conductivity of this material in reducing atmospheres 

is comparable to that of (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-? and (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Ti0.5Mn0.5O3-?. 

The overall level of the conduction of the perovskites is as low as 1 - 30 S/cm in anode atmospheres 

in the temperature range 973 - 1173 K. An acceptable electronic transport at low p(O2) may be expected for 

(La,Sr)(Cr,Fe)O3-?, (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? and selective representatives of Sr(Mn,Nb)O3-? and 

(La,Sr)(Mn,Cr,Ti)O3-? with moderate content of Nb or Ti. As for the transport properties in air and, 

consequently, applicability as cathodes, La-rich La1-xSrxMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? and Nb-rich SrMn1-xNbxO3-? 

perovskites are quite inappropriate for electrochemical utilizations. 



209 
 

The maximum electrochemical activity among the perovskite anodes applied onto LSGM electrolyte 

with protective CGO20 sublayer was observed for anodes with quite different cation compositions, which 

include (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.7Fe0.3O3-?, La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? and (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-?. The 

anodes provide quite similar overpotentials, at the level of ~150 mV under 100 mA/cm2 current density, 

which, however, are still higher compared to Ni-containing cermets (Fig. 5.15). The level of the anodic 

polarization resistance under OCV conditions of the most active electrode materials is as low as 1 - 2.5 

Ohm×cm2 which is quite comparable with the corresponding values reported for perovskite and perovskite-

related alternative anode in literature (Table 5.5). The present results are, however, more beneficial as no 

expensive current collector was applied to improve the electrode performance.

Considering possible origins of the trends in the polarization behavior of the perovskite anodes, one 

should emphasize the effects of the transport properties of the electrode materials, known from the literature. 

The effect of the electronic conductivity on the electrode properties has been reported for numerous groups of 

cathode materials, especially in the case of limited current collection over the electrode layer due to 

insufficient electronic transport (below 10 - 100 S/cm); this constriction is typical for doped manganites or 

perovskite-related groups containing “inert” cations in B-sublattice [681, 682]. However, one should take 

into account that in (La,Sr)MnO3±? and related systems compositional modifications basically have a multiple 

and complex influence and may simultaneously affect the stability, electronic and ionic transport, the 

thermomechanical properties, compatibility with the electrolyte materials, etc [226, 266, 305, 310, 323]. 

Therefore, elucidating a single performance-determining factor is generally a complex procedure. 

Among anode materials studied in literature, the effect of the electronic transport is more difficult to 

detect, primarily due to low availability of the information on the transport properties of the electrode 

materials under appropriate conditions. In particular, for Ni - YSZ cermets, an acceptable level of the total 

conductivity is achieved only when the volume fraction of the metal exceeds the percolation threshold, i.e. 20 

- 50 vol. % ([7, 266] and references cited). However, any variations in the content of the constituents in 

composites are accompanied by non-negligible microstructural changes, and an enrichment of the composite 



210 
 

with metallic phase beyond the optimum level basically leads to a drop of the performance. As shown in Fig. 

5.16, increasing Ni content above 30 vol.% in Ni - YSZ results in a gradual decrease of the Ohmic losses 

which reflects an improvement of the electronic transport of the anode layer. The polarization resistance, 

however, exhibits a minimum at 40 - 50 vol.% Ni [662]. Similar trends were detected for Cu-perovskite 

cermets [353]; the observation seems to be associated with strong sintering activity of Cu particles which 

may hamper the gas access or reduce the TPB in the case of large fractions of the metallic component.

polarization resistance for selected cermet 
anodes on the content of the metallic phase 

 

 

More informative with this respect might be studies on oxide-based anodes (in particular, those 

possessing the perovskite or perovskite-related structure). However, tracing the correlations between the 

electronic transport properties and electrode performance of such anodes is limited by low availability of the 

literature data and strong differences between the anode component compositions, microstructure, fabrication 

route, etc. which does not allow to elucidate the effect of the bulk properties of the electrode material. 

Comparative studies on various anode materials with perovskite, fluorite, pyrochlore or tungsten bronze 

structure revealed no obvious correlation between the low-p(O2) electronic conductivity and polarization 

resistance, although the Ohmic losses were generally lower for more conductive anode materials [683]. The 

performance of mixed-conducting anodes not subjected to any specific modifications follows the order 

Ce0.6Gd0.4O2-? &gt; Zr0.71Y0.12Ti0.17O2-? &gt; La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.97V0.03O3-?, irrespective to the trends in the ionic or 

electronic conductivity of the corresponding materials, and might be improved by addition of small amounts 

of Ni, in accordance with [684]. Comparison of the polarization behaviour of composite anodes, consisting of 

Ce0.8Ca0.2VO3-?, Gd1.86Ca0.14Ti2O7-?, Tb0.5Zr0.5O2-?, La0.9Sr0.1Al0.65Mg0.15Fe0.2O3-? as the main mixed-

conducting phase, and modified by introduction of ionically and/or electronically conductive components 

indicated that the performance is governed by numerous factors, primarily by the chemical, 

thermomechanical and microstructural stability, especially whenever a sufficient level of the electronic 

conductivity is achieved [107].

Analysis of the conductivity and polarization behaviour of the (La1-xSrx)Mn0.5Cr1-xTixO3-?, SrMn1-

xNbxO3-?, (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? and (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? anodes allows to reveal a good 

correlation between the electronic transport and electrochemical properties, as shown in Fig. 5.17, although 

in some cases the dependence is not strictly linear. Moreover, the obvious trends are observed only within a 

given perovskite group, while the electrodes fabricated from the representatives belonging to other perovskite 

series deviate from the correlation. This indicates that the electrode activity is substantially affected by some 

other factors.

polarization resistance and total conductivity of 
the electrode materials. All dashed lines are a 
guide for the eye 

 

In Table 5.6 the data on the linear chemical expansion of the perovskite materials on reduction in 

CO-CO2 flow and overpotential of the corresponding anodes are compared. The values demonstrate a 

reasonable correlation, although in some cases the comparison is complicated by differences between the 

compositions subjected to dilatometric and electrochemical tests (for example, 

(La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.2Ti0.3O3-? and (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.3Ti0.2O3-?, correspondingly). Nevertheless, the 

monotonous behaviour of both the chemical strains and electrochemical activity with Sr doping allows to 

suggest that the correlation between the thermomechanical and electrochemical properties should be 

satisfied. As known from previous reports [686-688], for optimum and stable anode operation the linear 

chemical expansion should be within 0.2 - 0.25% . Among the materials studied, the values of the anode 

overpotential below 100 mW/cm2 under current of 60 mA/cm2 are observed for perovskites with the 

expansivity lower 0.15 - 0.20%. 

Other factors which may influence the electrochemical behaviour include microstructural 

particularities (in particular, differences in the sinterability behaviour in various perovskite families), ionic 

transfer, catalytic activity, etc. In particular, for (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Fe0.1Ni0.05O3-?, the electrode performance 

may be additionally promoted by the presence of nano-scaled Ni particles on the surface, while 

comparatively high surface concentration of oxygen vacancies for Fe-doped chromites is also beneficial in 

terms of the electrochemical properties. Unfortunately, the data on the ionic conductivity or redox kinetics of 

the perovskites studied only allow to qualitatively estimate an approximate level of possible contribution of 

the bulk ionic transport or surface exchange into the overall electrode kinetics, without a certain prediction of 



213 
 

the trends under reducing conditions. Nevertheless, taking into account the apparently low level of the total 

conductivity (0.1 - 10 S/cm) under reducing conditions and the absence of any additives ensuring an 

appropriate current collection over the anode layer (in contrast to most data on the alternative anode materials 

reported in literature [8, 9, 16, 201], the electronic transport indeed seems to be a critical parameter 

responsible for the electrode activity.

5.3.2. Influence of anode layer microstructure on the electrochemical properties 

 

As discussed in Chapter 4.2, the perovskites (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-? with La:Sr ratio close to 1 exhibit 

an optimum combination of the functional characteristics for application as SOFC anodes. Therefore, a 

particular attention was drawn by cation-deficient (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-?. However, due to a strong 

tendency of the perovskite towards grain growth (Fig. 4.22), the procedure of preparation of the electrode 

layers should be carefully tuned. Micrographs in Fig. 5.18 represent typical microstructures of the electrode 

layers prepared from (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? powders processed in accordance with Table 2.4. 

In accordance with the strong sinterability, (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? powder without preliminary 

treatment ("coarse-1473") showed formation of large (20 - 30 µ m) grains imaged in Fig. 5.18 B. For 

comparison, much finer microstructure was observed (La0.85Sr0.15)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? powder prepared and 

deposited under analogous conditions (Fig. 5.18 A). Since large particles are unfavorable in terms of 

restricted surface area and poor percolation between the particles, the powder morphology was modified by 

preliminary grinding the electrode powder prior to coating. However, reducing the grain size caused a strong 

densification of the electrode layer, providing an extremely poor porosity and limited gas access to the 

electrochemically-active sites, as shown in Figs. 5.18 C and D.

215 
 

Diminishing the firing temperature of the "fine" electrodes suppressed the densification of the 

electrode layer (Figs. 5.18 C, D, E), at the expense of a worse contact between the electrode layer and 

electrolyte. As a result of the insufficient porosity of the electrode, the overpotential for the anodes prepared 

from "fine" powders enhanced by 4 - 5 times as compared to the "coarse-1473" anode layer (Fig. 5.19). 

In order to avoid the strong sinterability of the electrode powder, an additional step was included in 

the procedure of the electrode preparation, defined as "passivated-1473" in Table 2.4. Despite a possible 

deterioration of the surface activity by the additional high-temperature step, the benefit of the preservation of 

the porosity and at the same time suppressed formation of large grains (Fig. 5.18 F) in comparison with 

"coarse-1473" powder allowed to achieve the maximum electrochemical activity in the series (Fig. 5.19). 

Nevertheless, the electrochemical activity of the electrodes still remains rather low which requires further 

optimization of the preparation conditions or modification of the anode composition. 

 

5.3.3. Current-induced activation of anodes 

 

As mentioned in Chapter 4, Sr(Mn,Nb)O3-õ and (La,Sr)(Mn,Ti)O3-?-based anodes exhibit an 

improvement of their electrode activity after polarization cycling. The decrease of the polarization resistance 

was found to be as high as 35 - 40% for (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? anode (Fig. 5.20), which necessitates 

elucidation of the factors responsible for the improvement. One should note that cathodic current-induced 

activation has earlier been reported for (La,Sr)MnO3±?-based cathodes, attributable to generation of additional 

oxygen vacancies at the surface [689, 690] or microstructural effects. In particular, in [691] formation of 

nanosized pores near the interface electrode/electrolyte after applying the polarization potential of 0.8 V for 3 

hours was reported. Jiang et al. [692, 693] detected a transformation of large (La,Sr)MnO3±? agglomerates 

into smaller granular-shaped particles with more distinct boundaries taking place at the electrode/gas and 

electrode/electrolyte interfaces; applying the reverse current did not recover the initial microstructure.

electrolyte with CGO20 sublayer after polarization 
cycles. Inset shows corresponding changes in the

216 
 

Some variations of the morphology and topography at the interface cathode/electrolyte after 

polarization were also observed [694]. The activation of (La,Sr)MnO3±? cathodes might also be related with 

current-induced dissolution of surface impurities into the perovskite structure; such an improvement might be 

alternatively caused by preliminary moderate reduction of the cathode or exposure of the surface to dilute 

acid [311]. 

In order to elucidate possible microstructural effects on the activation of the electrochemical 

behaviour of (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? anodes, several half-cells composed of "passivated-1473" anode 

layers were fabricated using the technique described in Table 2.4 and subjected to several polarization runs 

(up to 700 mV) at 1073 K. The electrode morphologies for non-polarized anode layers and after 3 

polarization cycles are compared in Fig 5.21. 

Although a certain microscopic analysis is complicated due to poor adhesion of pos-tested electrode 

layers to the electrolyte which does not allow to compare adequately the interface between the cell 

components, SEM of the non-polarized electrode showed the presence of large agglomerates (up to 15-20 

µ m) of individual grains (Fig. 5.21 A) which might be responsible for the low electrochemical activity due to 

their poor percolation, low surface area, etc. After 3 polarization cycles one may observe a substantial 

reduction of the fraction of agglomerates and an increase of the amount of finer particles (Fig. 5.21 B). 

Moreover, in the latter case the particle size distribution becomes more uniform, while their form becomes 

more spherical in comparison with the non-polarized electrode powder, as determined visually. The particles 

seem to form a more continuous network which ensures a more adequate current collection over the entire 

electrode layer which might have a great impact on the electrochemical activity, especially taking into 

account the insufficient electronic conductivity of (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? under anode conditions. 

At the same time, one should note that the microscopic differences are not distinct, while the 

polarization effect might be alternatively associated with modifications of the bulk or surface properties of 

the electrode material. As an assumption, a slight oxidation of the perovskite might induce an enhancement 

of the electronic conductivity which is stabilized kinetically on subsequent cycles, in accordance with the 

slow equilibration exhibited by the materials.

5.3.4. Influence of the cation diffusion phenomena on the electrochemical activity. Effect of 

the solid electrolyte and protective sublayer on the anode behaviour. 
 

Fig. 5.22. represents polarization curves of selected perovskite-based anode materials in contact with 

apatite and LSGM electrolytes; in both cases a sublayer of CGO20 was applied between the cell components. 

In accordance with previous studies [591, 594, 660, 661] and with results collected on cermet anodes in 

Chapter 5.2, the performance of silicate-based electrochemical cells is poor. The same conclusion can be 

drawn from comparison of the polarization resistance values listed in Tables 5.5 and 5.7. In particular, the 

polarization resistance of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? which showed the optimum performance among 

studied perovskite anodes varies in the range 3 - 7 Ohm×cm2 at 1073 K on the apatite-type electrolyte, as 

shown in Fig. 5.23. The corresponding values for the same anode obtained on LSGM are as low as 1.0 - 1.5 

Ohm×cm2 (Fig. 5.24). 

The effect of the anode material on the polarization behaviour is similar for both electrolytes and 

qualitatively follows the trends of the electronic conductivity of the corresponding perovskites. The level of 

the polarization resistance of the perovskite anodes studied is somewhat higher in comparison with earlier 

reported data (Table 5.5); however, one should note that most previous results have been obtained on mixed-

conducting anodes activated by distribution of Pt particles over the electrode surface. This alternatively 

indicates that the transport and catalytic properties of the anode material have a significant influence on the 

electrode activity, irrespective of the electrolyte.

On the other hand, the maximum difference between the performances of LSGM and La10Si5AlO26.5 

electrolyte is observed for more active anode materials, which reflects a strong contribution of additional 

limitations relevant specifically to the apatite-type materials or related interfaces. One of possible 

explanations of enhanced activity of the anodes in contact with LSGM might primarily be associated with the 

transport properties of the electrolyte materials. As observed in numerous studies, the electrode polarization-

related parameters show an obvious relationship with the bulk electrolyte resistivity originating from non-

uniform current distribution due to discrete contacts between the porous electrodes and solid electrolyte or 

from an influence of the concentration of ionic and electronic charge carriers at the electrolyte surface on the 

exchange rate [584, 587, 695-697]. 

When the surface of the solid electrolyte is exposed to a reducing atmosphere or cation diffusion 

from the electrode, the enhanced amount of oxygen vacancies may directly contribute into the overall 

electrochemical process; the latter phenomenon is primarily relevant to CeO2-?- and LaGaO3-?-based 

electrolytes [567, 596, 597]. Another benefit of gallate-based electrolytes may be related with higher 

contribution of the electronic conductivity in comparison with La10Si5AlO26.5, as shown in Table 5.1. This 

factor is especially promoted by the dissolution of transition metal cations in the electrolyte matrix, as 

confirmed by EDS results shown below. Nevertheless, the ionic transport in the electrolyte material cannot 

be the unique origin of the poor electrochemical characteristics of the cells with La10Si5AlO26.5. For example, 

relative anodes showed quite acceptable performance in contact with zirconia-based materials [8, 11, 177, 

184], contradictive to the trends in the ionic conductivity of the corresponding electrolytes. 

As known from the literature [566, 594] and as demonstrated for cermet anodes, a worse activity of 

the anode applied onto apatite-type electrolyte might relate to segregation and spreading of silica species 

along the surfaces, grain boundaries of ceramics, interface anode/electrolyte, etc. Analyzing the literature 

reports on the chemical compatibility between the La10(SiO4)6O2-based phases with electrode materials, one 

may emphasis formation of silicates Sr2SiO4 and Nd2SiO5 in contact with (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-? (annealed at 

1173 K) [566] and Nd2NiO4-? (1473 K) [659], respectively. In the latter case, Ni diffusivity caused 

segregation of additional La4Ni3O10+? phase. However, most authors indicate that the strong reactivity is 

generally not typical for apatites in the temperature range corresponding to the cell preparation conditions 

[566, 591, 594], at least within the uncertainties of XRD analysis. 

At the same time, a significant concern is caused by the cation interdiffusion between the cell 

components; this is especially relevant to migration of Si and La into the electrodes or interlayers or an 

enrichment of the electrolyte with transition metal or alkali-earth cations. In particular, a low performance 

and degradation of the electrode properties for (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O3-? [566], Lan+1(Ni,Cu)nO3n+1 [591, 594] and 

Gd0.6Ca0.4Mn0.9Ni0.1O3-? [591] cathodes were attributed to the presence of Si in the electrodes detected after 

the cell preparation or electrochemical tests. Another important issue is associated with La diffusivity 

resulting from a gradient of the La chemical potential between the cell components. For apatite-type 

electrolytes, this process is promoted by the presence of La2O3-related compounds which often accompany 

the synthesis process or may be separated due to silica losses [21, 566]. One of concerns relates to 

penetration of La cations in CeO2-based phases with formation of (La,Ce)O2-? solutions with suppressed 

transport properties, as has been detected between La10Si5.5Al0.5O26.75 and CGO20 at temperatures above 



220 
 

1273 K [566]. Similar to most ionic conductors studied, the apatite structure enables a dissolution of 

transition metal cations [566, 591, 594, 659]. While in moderate amounts this phenomenon does not seem to 

be critical, the diffusivity of alkali-earth cations might be undesirable due to a possible decrease of the 

amount of interstitial oxygen species or formation of CaO-SiO2 or SrO-SiO2 blocking layers [591, 698]. 

Considering the chemical compatibility of gallate electrolytes with electrode materials, one should 

note that a direct contact of LSGM with materials containing transition metal species, both in metallic or 

cation state, should be avoided due to a possible cation diffusion and dissolution in the gallate lattice. In 

particular, penetration of Fe, Co, Ni and to some extent Mn cations into LSGM may induce their substitution 

for Ga and cause a segregation of LaSrGa3O7, LaSrGaO4, LaNiO3-? or other interfacial phases with poor 

transport properties [699-703]. Depletion of LSGM with Ga due to the vaporization processes [30, 633], 

interaction with Pt contacts [581, 633] or Ga diffusion into the electrode phase [700] may also represent a 

problem in terms of the stability and ionic conduction of the electrolyte material. Large gradients of the 

chemical potential of La between the cell components may lead to their undesirable enrichment or depletion 

with La and/or accumulation of the corresponding decompositions products at the interfaces [278, 703]. At 

the same time, one should note that in the case of adequate fabrication and processing conditions of the cell, 

the degradation phenomena taking place in LSGM-based cells are not substantial in comparison with those 

typical for apatite-type electrolytes [21, 594, 659]. 

In accordance with numerous studies, the problem of the cation diffusivity may be suppressed by 

preliminary deposition of protective layers onto the electrolyte surface. For this purpose, a wide application 

has been received by ceria-based layers, preferentially in the porous form in order to provide additional 

catalytically active centers and extend the electrochemical zone. Table 5.8 represents selected literature data 

on the effect of the protective layer on the polarization-related parameters of cathodes and anodes. For some 

electrode/electrolyte couples, the presence of the sublayer reduces the polarization resistance by 1 - 2 orders, 

although the Ohmic losses may exhibit an increase. This requires reduction of the sublayer thickness down to 

a definite level (below 5 - 10 µ m) which effectively prevents the diffusion processes and provides a 

minimum Ohmic resistance. 

In order to confirm that a contamination of anode layers with silica and/or a possible cation 

exchange between the cell components are primarily responsible for the electrochemical behaviour observed, 

the following studies were carried out on the cells composed of similar electrodes/electrolytes; the unique 

difference being the presence/absence of protective CGO20 sublayer. The electrochemical tests were 

combined with EDS analysis performed on the layers near the interface. The conditions of the sublayer 

deposition are described in Chapter 2. 

A positive effect of the CGO20 sublayer was demonstrated for anodes/cathodes on LSGM and 

La10Si5AlO26.5 electrolytes; selected examples of the improved electrochemical behaviour are shown in Fig. 

5.25. The improvement was essentially pronounced for Mn- or Cr-enriched perovskites confirming the strong 

diffusivity of Mn and Cr species, although this phenomenon might be alternatively attributed to enhanced 

electrochemical activity of the corresponding electrodes and their higher susceptibility towards the 

modifications.

In order to check a possible cation exchange, model LSGM - (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? and 

La10Si5AlO26.5 - (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? half-cells were prepared by firing in air at 1448 K and the 

surfaces obtained after fracturing the cell across the interface were examined by SEM/EDS analysis. The 

experiments were carried out on cells where the electrolyte and electrode layer were subjected to a direct 

contact or where the protective sublayer was preliminary coated onto the electrolyte. Fig. 5.26 shows the 

EDS spectra of the apatite and perovskite phases collected in the vicinity (1 - 3 µ m) to the interface in 

comparison with the cation composition of the corresponding phases obtained in more remoted regions where 

any influence of the cation penetration should be negligible.

223 
 

In the case of the direct contact between the electrode and electrolyte, the most obvious change in 

the element composition is associated with chromium migration into the apatite phase. As discussed in 

Chapter 1.2.7, a contamination of cell components with Cr proceeds via bulk/surface diffusion mechanism or 

involves a participation of volatile CrOx(OH)y compositions deposited at the electrolyte surface [82, 83, 285, 

288]. As the intensity of the peaks attributable to La and Cr is substantially reduced at the interfacial layers of 

the electrode, the diffusion mechanism seems to be dominant in the present case, since vaporization-induced 

chromium losses from the electrode layers contacting with the electrolyte should be comparable or even 

suppressed in comparison with those at the electrode/gas interface. 

Some changes were also found for Ni-related signal. A decrease in its intensity observed for 

(La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? phase close to the interface confirms the diffusivity of Ni into the apatite 

phases, in accordance with [594, 659], although a comparison of the relative depletion of the perovskite with 

Cr and Ni is complicated due to the low intensity of the Ni peak. No enrichment of the apatite phase with Ni 

was detected, presumably due to a low Ni content in the parent perovskite. Analysis of Si distribution is 

complex due to a strong overlapping of Si and Sr peaks. One may observe a change of the symmetry and 

intensity of the corresponding peak in both contacting phases close to the interface; the character of the 

changes indicates a possible depletion of the apatite with Si and an enrichment with Sr. 

No obvious differences in the cation distribution over the apatite phase were found for the cell 

containing a protective layer of CGO20 (Fig. 5.26 B) indicating that the differences in the spectra in Fig. 5.26 

A and C indeed demonstrate the cation interdiffusion. Although the performance of the cells containing a 

sublayer applied onto La10Si5AlO26.5 electrolyte is somewhat improved in comparison with analogous cells 

where the electrode and electrolyte are in the direct contact (Fig. 5.25), the electrochemical activity is still 

poor. Unfortunately, due to a small thickness and high porosity of the CGO20 layer, no adequate data on the 

cation distribution over the interface apatite/ceria might be collected from the respective area. In accordance 

with [566, 594], La and/or Si cations might have a tendency to accumulate in the sublayer or electrolyte layer 

close to the interface, suppressing the ionic transfer and electrochemical activity. 

The results of the elemental analysis, carried out on analogous LSGM-based cells are qualitatively 

similar to those obtained for the apatite-based cells (Fig. 5.27). In the case of direct contact of LSGM 

electrolyte with chromite-based electrode, one may observe a strong enrichment of the electrolyte region 

close to the electrode with Cr and simultaneous reduction of the Cr-related peak on the spectrum of the 

electrode phase close to the interface in comparison with the bulk (Fig. 5.27 A and C). No presence of Ni 

species which might be detrimental in terms of the transport properties of the gallate [635, 701] was detected 

in LSGM phase, although this also might be associated with the small (5%) content of Ni in the electrode 

phase. Gallium exhibits an accumulation at the electrolyte-contacting layer of the electrode resulted from Ga 

diffusion or evaporation of Ga-containing species with subsequent deposition. 

Application of CeO2-based sublayer suppresses the interdiffusion between the electrode and LSGM 

electrolyte; an example is demonstrated in Fig. 5.27 B. No visible differences between the bulk electrolyte 

phase and the region close to the interface between the cell components were detected, within the 

uncertainties of the elemental analysis. As for the corresponding changes in the electrode, a certain analysis is 

complicated due to the porosity of the layer and problems of determination of the distinct boundary between 



224 
 

the CGO20 and (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? layers which, in particular, results in appearance of small 

peaks related to Ce or Gd in the perovskite phase. 

As a result of the contamination of the electrode layer with silica and/or cation interdiffusion 

between the components, the cells containing the apatite as solid electrolyte exhibit a rapid degradation. As 

shown in Fig. 5.28 A, after exposure of (La0.55Sr0.45)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.3Ti0.2O3-? anode to polarization cycling under 

overpotentials of 500 - 800 mV, the polarization and Ohmic resistance exhibit an irreversible increase, equal 

to~25% and 50%, respectively, despite the presence of the protective CGO20 layer. An application of similar 

overpotentials on the same cells with LSGM solid electrolyte induces only a ~5% increase of the polarization 

resistance, without visible changes of the Ohmic losses. One should note that in the latter case the 

temperature was as high as 1073 K which should promote the degradation processes. The results demonstrate 

a poor tolerance of the electrochemical cells based on apatite-type electrolytes towards the SOFC operation 

conditions, in accordance with previously reported data [591, 594, 659-661].

5.3.5. Impact of infiltrated additives on anode activity 
 

 
As shown in Table 5.5, the level of the polarization resistance of the perovskite-based anodes 

exceeds 1 - 2 Ohm×cm2 at 1073 K which is rather high for electrochemical applications and indicates 

constrictions related with a non-adequte current collection or insufficient electrocatalytic activity. In order to 

improve the performances, subsequent optimization steps are required; one of those relates to wet 

impregnation of the anode layer with catalytically-active additions such as CeO2-? and Ni. Fig. 5.29 

demonstrates the effect of CeO2-õ and Ni additions into selected anode layer on their electrochemical 

behaviour, while the microstrucutures of modified layers are shown in Fig. 5.30. In particular, Figs. 5.30 G, 

H represent formation of submicron ceria particles inside the porous structure of SrMn0.6Nb0.4O3-? anodes. 

Impregnation of Ni-containing solutions into the porous (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? layer did 

not demonstrate a substantial activating effect indicating that the amount and distribution of the Ni metallic 

particles separated from the perovskite lattice at low p(O2) is close to the optimum level and further additions 

of Ni is non-effective. On the other hand, the performance may be substantially improved by infiltration of 

ceria particles into the anode, yielding the current densities as high as ~55 and ~140 mA/cm2 at 973 K and 

1073 K, respectively, under the anodic overpotential of 80 mV (Fig.5.29). 

The preferential incorporation of CeO2-? phase in comparison with Ni, combined with the reasonable 

performance observed for “pure” layer of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? allows to suggest that the 

material possesses a satisfactory electronic conductivity and catalytic activity towards hydrogen oxidation 



226 
 

required for an adequate anode activity, while the ionic transport-related parameters, in particular, the surface 

concentration of the oxygen vacancies are insufficient; this problem may be overcome by the distribution of 

ceria particles over the anode surface. In contrast, the low electronic and ionic conductivity as well as poor 

electrocatalytic activity of representatives of (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Cr1-xTixO3-? or Sr(Mn,Nb)O3-? series makes it 

possible to optimize the performance via incorporation of both CeO2-? and Ni phases. 

The activating effect is similar to additions of praseodimia phase into cathode layers demonstrated in 

Chapters 3.1.7 and 3.3.3. A positive influence of the wet impregnation or other techniques of incorporating 

the catalytically-active species has been demonstrated in numerous studies [7, 107, 266, 352, 365, 567]; with 

respect to the electrode layers studied in the present work, the effect may primarily relate to microstructural 

optimization, enhanced electrode surface area and TPB, promotion of the transport properties and the 

catalytic activity of the electrode material, etc. 

Considering that the wet impregnation may provide a sufficient and uniform distribution of the 

electrochemically-active components over the anode layer utilizing comparatively small quantities of the 

precursors, this approach may also be regarded to be beneficial in terms of reducing the costs of the electrode 

materials and fabrication techniques in comparison with many other methods of the deposition of the 

electrode layers, if related to the same power output of the electrochemical cells. However, introduction of 

dissolved cations into the electrode layers requires an additional high-temperature step which may cause 

microstructural or thermomechanical problems after thermal/redox cycling. With this respect, preliminary 

introduction of the electrochemically active components into the oxide matrix and subsequent in-situ 

generation of the electrochemically active sites might be more beneficial, as shown for 

(La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? perovskite in the present study and for Ni- or Ru-doped analogues in 

literature [15, 186, 544].

5.4. Final remarks 
 
 

The results obtained on electrochemical cells with gallate- and silicate-based solid electrolytes show 

that irrespective of their comparable and reasonably high ionic conductivity, the electrochemical 

performances of the anodes on these electrolytes is quite different. This indicates that the activity is primarily 

determined by the tolerance of the electrolyte material towards the environmental conditions and 

compatibility with the electrodes rather than by intrinsic transport properties of the electrolyte composition. 

In particular, a strong effect of cation interdiffusion was observed, less pronounced at the presence of 

protective CGO20 layer. With respect to the behavior observed, a serious degradation of the electrochemical 

properties occurs due to contamination of the electrode surface, catalytically-active sites, etc. with silica in 

the case of apatite-type electrolyte. 

 The electrode activity of perovskite-like anodes correlates with the low-p(O2) electronic 

conductivity and chemical expansivity of the corresponding materials on redox cycling. Nevertheless, the 

correlation is not strictly linear and shows significant deviations if comparing the electrochemical properties 

of various perovskite groups. This indicates that some other factors such as the surface gas exchange kinetics 

or oxygen vacancy diffusion may be responsible for the anode activity. 

The performance of both cermet and perovskite-like electrodes might be considerably improved by 

infiltration of catalytically active ceria or nickel particles into the electrode layer. The effect is especially 

pronounced for CeO2-õ introduction indicating the limitations associated with the catalytic activity of the 

perovskite anodes or surface vacancy concentration. Nevertheless, even for the most active anodes the 

performance was obtained insufficient for practical applications. This indicates the necessity of subsequent 

optimization of the functional characteristics of the electrode and electrolyte materials or cell preparation 

procedure.

Conclusions 

 
The study was focused on the development of cathode and anode materials based on perovskite-like 

chromite, manganite and titanate materials. The task indicated involved evaluation of phase and structural 

relationships, transport, thermomechanical and electrochemical characteristics of the oxide materials studied. 

Another purpose was related with determination of the principal performance-determining factors and search 

of approaches allowing to optimize the performance of the electrochemical cells considered. Based on the 

results obtained, the following conclusion can be drawn from the study: 

1. In perovskites (La0.75-xSr0.25+x)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5-xTixO3-? titanium may partially or completely substitute for 

chromium cations provided that the doping is accompanied by introduction of the equivalent  amount of Sr 

into A-sublattice. The phase and structural stability as well as the transport and electrochemical properties 

under oxidizing conditions are quite tolerant towards the substitution. Enhanced generation of the oxygen 

vacancies upon redox cycling, more pronounced for Sr- and Ti-enriched compositions, leads to larger thermal 

and chemical expansion. However, the main drawback related with the introduction of Sr and Ti refers to the 

strong drop of the electronic conductivity under the anode conditions resulting in a worse electrochemical 

behavior.  

2.  (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr1-xFexO3-? perovskites possess an enhanced ionic conduction under reducing 

conditions as compared with most chromite-based materials, which might to some extent be responsible for 

their promising anode activity. Nevertheless, the electronic conductivity seems have a more pronounced 

influence on the electrode properties, taking into account the correlation between the low-p(O2) conductivity 

and anode performance for the compositions with various Fe content.   

3. Insufficient solubility of Ni in (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-? perovskite and/or the presence of the 

impurity (Ni,Mg)O ensures the separation of metallic Ni nano-sized particles which promote an enhanced 

electrochemical performance of the corresponding anodes. 

4. Doping (La1-xSrx)1-yMn0.5Ti0.5O3-? and SrMn1-xNbxO3-? with donor-like cations improves their tolerance 

towards reduction. However, lower concentration of p-type charge carriers in La- and Nb-enriched 

compositions, respectively, significantly deteriorates their electronic conduction. As a result, the perovskites 

SrMn1-xNbxO3-? showed poor cathodic and anodic performance, while the anode based on 

La0.5Sr0.5Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? oxide, moderately doped with donor-like cations, exhibited an adequate activity 

without additional modifications. One should note that La-enriched (La1-xSrx)0.95Mn0.5Ti0.5O3-? (? = 0.75 - 

0.85) are characterized by the phase transitions and slow equilibration kinetics upon variations of the oxygen 

nonstoichiometry resulting in a strong hysteresis, degradation of the transport properties and ceramics 

integrity which restricts their applicability as anodes. 

5. Despite the sufficient and comparable level of the ionic conductivity in LSGM and La10Si5AlO26.5, 

which exceeds that in ZrO2-based materials, the electrochemical characteristics of the cells composed of the 

corresponding electrolytes are substantially different. This indicates that the electrode activity is primarily 

governed by the stability of the electrolyte material under operation conditions and the compatibility between 

the cell components. The performance of anodes applied onto the apatite-type electrolyte is poor, presumably 

owing to the contamination with silica and resultant blocking of the electrochemically-active sites. The 



230 
 

electrode properties may be to some extent optimized by compositional or microstructural modifications, in 

particular, by impregnation with solutions of catalytically-active species, however the activity still remains 

inadequate, especially in terms of the long-term performance.  

6. The electrochemical behavior is significantly affected by the cation interdiffusion between the cell 

components, especially in the case of the direct contact, without the application of protective layers. 

Although the cation exchange is typical for the cells containing both gallate- and silicate-based electrolytes, 

in the latter case the influence of diffusion on the electrochemical characteristics is more critical. The 

interdiffusion and interaction phenomena can be reduced by utilization of CeO2-based sublayer between the 

electrolyte and electrode rendering an improvement of the electrochemical properties. In particular, the 

polarization resistance of some perovskite-based anodes may be diminished down to 1 - 1.5 Ohm×cm2 at 

1073 K under zero current. 

7. The activity of most perovsite-based anodes generally correlates with the electronic conductivity trends, 

consistently with the insufficient hole transport under the operation conditions. Another factor that apparently 

affets the electrochemical properties relates to the chemical expansivity of the anode material on redox 

cycling. On the other hand, the correlation is not strict and one may observe deviations between various 

compositional series which indicates the effect of other factors such as surface exchange kinetics, oxygen 

diffusion-related parameters, etc.  

8. The electrode activity may be improved by introducing catalytically-active agents such as CeO2-? and/or 

Ni (for anodes) and PrOx (for cathodes). The most pronounced effect is observed upon addition of ceria into 

the anode layer which suggests the electrode limitations associated with the catalytic activity of the 

perovskites studied, surface concentration of oxygen vacancies, etc. Despite the improvement, the electrode 

performance still remains on the level, insufficient for practical utilization which requires further 

optimization of the electrode preparation proceduce, selection of the functional materials, etc. 

9. For La10Si5AlO26.5-based electrochemical cells a substantial raise of the ohmic and polarization losses 

was observed. The degradation was especially pronounced at a large (&gt;500 mV) anode polarization. The 

electrodes in contact with LSGM electrolyte possess a higher stability, while some manganite-based anode 

exhibit an improvement in terms of the activity after polarization cycling. However, thermal cycles cause an 

enlargement of both ohmic and polarization resistance which necessitates an optimization of the contact 

between the cell components.

Fig. A1. XRD patterns of (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-õ ceramics collected at various temperatures. Inset 
shows XRD at different temperatures for the peaks around 32.5o (blue and red vertical lines correspond to 
theoretical positions of orthorhombic and rhombohedral phase, respectively). 
 
 
 

High-temperature XRD measurements were carried out at the North Carolina A&amp;amp;T State University 

by Dr. S.N. Yarmolenko and Prof. J. Sankar. The details on the equipment utilized, measuring conditions etc 

may be found in Chapter 2 or [708]. 

As noted in Chapter 3.3.1, LaCrO3-based compositions exhibit a transformation of the low-

temperature orthorhombic structure into the rhombohedral one stable occurring on heating in air. The 

transition temperature is governed by the radius of dopant cations; examples are shown in Table 3.13. Fig. 

A1 demonstrates an evolution of XRD patterns collected on (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-õ ceramics 

equilibrated at several temperatures with the step of 3 K in the range 318 - 369 K. Analysis of the XRD data 

shows that the transition orthorhombic - rhombohedral occurs at the temperatures around 350 K. A close 

value was observed by dilatometric measurements carried out on continuous heating of a ceramic sample in 

air, as demonstrated in Fig. 3.28. 

On further heating in the range 373 - 1073 K the rhombohedral phase retains, as shown in Fig. A2. 

The parameters a and c in hexagonal settings calculated from the patterns linearly increase upon heating, as 

demonstrated in Fig. 3.28. The average TEC for the parameter c is more than twice larger in comparison with 

that for the parameter a (15.3×10-6 K-1 vs. 7.0×10-6 K-1), while the ratio c/a gradually increases on heating 

indicating an anisotropy along [001] direction. The average linear TEC calculated from the high-temperature 

XRD data is evaluated as 9.8×10-6 K-1 which is slightly lower in comparison with the value obtained from the 

dilatometric studies in the same temperature range (10.1×10-6 K-1). More details on the structural behaviour 

of the perovskite (La0.9Sr0.1)0.95Cr0.85Mg0.1Ni0.05O3-õ may be found in [708].
