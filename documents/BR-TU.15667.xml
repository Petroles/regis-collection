ABSTRACT: The interdependence between the C and N cycles is reflected by the levels of soil organic
matter (SOM). SOM and organic C levels in water soluble (C-WS) humic acids (C-HA), fulvic acids (C-FA),
and humin fractions (C-H) were evaluated through the classic chemical fractionation method in samples of a
Rhodic Eutrudox from a randomized blocks experimental design, with split-split-plots using five nitrogen
sidedressing levels for corn (0; 60; 120; 180; and 240 kg ha-1 N) as the main treatment, two crop sequences
(corn-corn and soybean-corn) as the secondary treatment, and two sampling depths (0 to 0.2 and 0.2 to 0.4 m)
as a sub-subtreatment. Nitrogen fertilization did not affect SOM levels, but favored the synthesis of substances
in the C-HA fraction. There was a quadratic effect of N rates on the C-WS and C-FA levels in the corn-corn
succession. The soybean-corn succession resulted in larger SOM and organic C levels in the C-H fraction.

RESUMO: A interdependência dos ciclos de C e N reflete-se nos teores de matéria orgânica do solo (MOS).
Em um delineamento experimental em blocos casualizados, com parcelas sub-subdivididas, tendo como
tratamento principal cinco doses de nitrogênio de cobertura na cultura do milho (0; 60; 120; 180 e 240 kg ha-1 de
N), como tratamento secundário, as sucessões milho-milho e soja-milho, e como sub-subtratamento, duas
profundidades de amostragem (0 a 0.2 e 0.2 a 0.4 cm), avaliaram-se os teores de MOS e de C orgânico nas
frações solúvel em água (C-SA), ácidos húmicos (C-AH), ácidos fúlvicos (C-AF) e humina (C-H), por meio
do método clássico de fracionamento químico, em um Latossolo Vermelho eutrófico, de textura argilosa. A
adubação nitrogenada não afetou os teores de MOS, mas favoreceu a síntese de compostos da fração C-AH.
Houve efeito quadrático das doses de N nos teores de C-SA e de C-AF na sucessão milho-milho. A sucessão
soja-milho resultou em maiores teores de MOS e de C orgânico na fração humina.

INTRODUCTION

Amendment with organic residues is a
longstanding practice to increase or preserve soil organic
matter (SOM). Efforts have also been made to demon-
strate that productivity increases due to mineral fertili-
zation are sufficient to maintain SOM because of the in-
corporation of crop residues (Kiehl, 1985). Some of the
practices that may increase SOM contents are: establish-
ment of pastures, reduced soil tillage, and adoption of
crop rotation schemes with the inclusion of species that
yield a great amount of residues, among others (Bayer &amp;amp;
Mielniczuk, 1999). Decreased SOM is related to the use
of inadequate agricultural management systems, and
could be the result of low fertility, low production of resi-
dues, excess tillage, and accelerated erosion; insisting on
this error may render the system unfeasible from an eco-

nomic or environmental point of view (Mielniczuk,
1999).

In rotation systems, the cultivation of legumes
may increase SOM contents directly by the addition of
C from plant tissues, or indirectly, by changing their qual-
ity and turnover, as well as by affecting the amount of
residues produced by the subsequent crop, due to the in-
corporation into the soil of symbiotically-fixed N (Cadish
et al., 1998). It is also known that soil C and N contents,
either organic or total, decrease as soybean cultivation fre-
quency increases in crop rotation systems, as a conse-
quence of the low amount of residues yielded by the crop
(Havlin et al., 1990; Varvel, 1994) and because of the N
exported in the grain (Havlin et al., 1990). These results
may not be entirely applicable to Brazilian conditions,
since studies targeted at the selection of strains, aiming
to maximize the biological fixation of N by soybean, en-

sure greater amounts of N in the grain and total N accu-
mulated by the plants, as compared to other countries
(Vargas &amp;amp; Hungria, 1997).

Similarly to the use of legumes in cropping sys-
tems, nitrogen sidedressing fertilization in annual crops
such as corn can also be responsible for increased SOM
contents, by increasing the amount of crop residues that
return to the soil (Liang et al., 1998). In an experiment
conducted for eight years in the USA, Varvel (1994) veri-
fied that the increases in SOM contents with monocul-
ture soybean or with soybean in rotation with either corn
or sorghum were smaller than the increases obtained due
to nitrogen sidedressing in corn or sorghum monocultures.

The comparisons between corn production sys-
tems, either as a monoculture or in rotation with soybean,
fertilized or not with N, can be extended to SOM qual-
ity, represented by the humic acids, fulvic acids, and hu-
min fractions. Under reduced soil tillage, Nascimento et
al. (1991) observed that corn grown in rotation with soy-
bean had about 27% more C in the humic acids fraction
than in monoculture corn. In the no-till system, Sousa &amp;amp;
Melo (2003) observed higher C contents in the fulvic ac-
ids fraction when growing corn in rotation with soybean,
as compared with monoculture corn. With regard to ni-
trogen fertilization, Tan et al. (1972) observed increased
C contents in the humic acids fraction with variable N
doses.

The humic acids, fulvic acids, and humin frac-
tions, obtained by means of chemical fractionation, pos-
sess peculiar characteristics that qualify SOM under sev-
eral aspects. Among these characteristics, it is worth not-
ing the great number of acid groupings in the humic and
fulvic acids fractions, largely responsible for soil cation
exchange and acid-base buffering capacities (MacCarthy,
2001), and the association of compounds in the humin
fraction with soil mineral colloids, which impart resis-
tance to biodegradation (Rice, 2001).

This work had the objective of evaluating the ef-
fects of nitrogen sidedressing in corn when grown after
previous cultivations with corn or soybean, on the amount
and quality of the produced SOM.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The experiment was carried out on a clayey-tex-
tured (590 g kg-1 clay, 210 g kg-1 silt and 200 g kg-1 sand)

Rhodic Eutrudox, in a center pivot irrigated area in Morro
Agudo, SP, Brazil (20º40’S, 48º15’W). The climate of the
region, according to Köppen’s classification, is AW
(tropical with a rainy summer, dry winter, and mean tem-
perature in the coolest month higher than 18ºC). Oliveira
&amp;amp; Prado (1987) classified the water and thermal regimes
as udic and epithermal, respectively.

At a stage prior to the proper experiment, the area
was tilled by means of a scarification with a five-shank
scarifier, down to a depth of 30 cm, followed by one har-
rowing with a 20-disk harrow and two harrowings with
a 44-disk leveling harrow. Following tillage, cultivations
were made with corn (October 1998 to February 1999),
bean (April to August 1999), and corn (September 1999
to February 2000). Then, the entire area was sampled at
soil layers from 0 to 20, 20 to 40, and 40 to 60 cm, and
20 cores were collected from each layer in order to form
a composite sample. The soil chemical analysis (Raij et
al., 1987) is presented in Table 1.

Five nitrogen sidedressing rates were evaluated
in corn as the main treatment in the plots, with two crop
successions as the secondary treatment in the subplots and
two depths as sub-subtreatments, in a split-split plot ran-
dom block design with four replicates. In the secondary
treatments, the two crop successions consisted of corn
grown after corn (C-C) and corn grown after soybean (S-
C). In the main treatment, N sidedressing was applied
during the last corn cultivation, at rates of 0; 60; 120; 180;
and 240 kg ha-1, as urea. The N sidedressing doses were
applied at 14; 30; 46; and 57 days after emergence, when
plants had 4; 8; or 12 leaves, and at tasseling, respectively.
The sub-subplots consisted of soil layers from 0 to 20 cm
and 20 to 40 cm.

By the time the secondary treatments were estab-
lished, the soybean was sown before the corn (March and
May 2000, respectively), in order to avoid corn shading
over the soybean. After harvest, the soybean and corn
plants were cut just above soil surface and chopped with
a rotary hoe. Crop stubble incorporation was performed
at tillage, by means of scarification and level harrowing,
which, according to Bayer &amp;amp; Mielniczuk (1997), char-
acterize reduced tillage. In October 2000, corn was sown
as a last crop in all subplots. After harvesting this last
corn crop, the soil from each sub-subplot was sampled
in accordance to the procedure adopted for the initial soil
sampling.

At the end of the experiment, SOM fractionation
and C determination in the organic fractions were per-
formed for the soil samples of the 0 to 20 and 20 to 40
cm layers, according to methods described in Yagi et al.
(2003). The SOM was fractionated according to its solu-
bility in alkaline and acid media, with sodium hydroxide
and sulfuric acid. C in the organic fractions was obtained
by sulfochromic digestion and quantified by colorimetry.
The organic matter fractions determination included: wa-
ter-soluble organic carbon (C-WS), humic substances (C-
HS), fulvic acids (C-FA), humic acids (C-HA), and hu-
min (C-H). The results were submitted to analysis of vari-
ance and the means were then compared (Tukey at 5%).
The N dose effects were analyzed by polynomial regres-
sion.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The soybean-corn succession presented higher
SOM contents (P &amp;lt;0.01) than the corn-corn succession,
with a significant effect of the interaction between crop
successions and sampling depths (Table 2). When the ef-

fects of this interaction are partitioned (Figure 1), the dif-
ference between SOM contents in both crop successions
was restricted to the depth from 0 to 20 cm, where the
soybean-corn succession was higher than the corn-corn
succession by about 2 g dm-3 (P &amp;lt;0.05).

Soil organic matter in crop successions 377

Sci. Agric. (Piracicaba, Braz.), v.62, n.4, p.374-380, July/Aug. 2005

The amount of residues yielded by soybean tops
(7,950 kg ha-1 dry matter) was lower than those of corn
(15,470 kg ha-1 dry matter) grown in the same season. In
addition, there were about 136% more N in the dry mat-
ter of the soybean in relation to the dry matter of corn,
which suggests that the legume residues undergo faster
decomposition. Although root dry matter yield was not
determined, these data were estimated from results ob-
tained by Buyanovsky &amp;amp; Wagner (1986), considering
root: top ratios of 0.37 and 0.84 for soybean and corn,
respectively, at the 0 to 20 cm depth. Thus, the theoreti-
cal dry matter yields for soybean and corn roots were
about 2,940 and 12,990 kg ha-1, respectively. With regard
to dry matter yield in the tops of the last corn crop, the
yield obtained after soybean was 278 kg ha-1 higher than
that obtained after corn. In long-term experiments, a
greater input of crop residues (Havlin et al., 1990; Varvel,
1994; Bayer &amp;amp; Mielniczuk, 1997) and lower soil tillage
intensity (Bayer &amp;amp; Mielniczuk, 1997) are decisive fac-
tors to increase SOM contents in cropping systems. How-
ever, based on the data presented, the input of organic
residues into the soil was not the factor responsible for
the higher SOM contents verified in the soybean-corn
succession.

Considering the amounts of residues added by the
soybean and corn crops and the short experimental pe-
riod evaluated in the present study, it is believed that the
chemical composition of the organic residues from these
two crops was the factor responsible for the higher SOM
contents in the soybean-corn succession. The chemical
composition analysis conducted by Broder &amp;amp; Wagner
(1988) in the vegetative tops of soybean and corn plants
corroborate this reasoning. Those authors observed that
soybean and corn residues showed lignin concentrations
of 119 and 56 g kg-1, respectively, that is, the soybean
residues had approximately 113% more lignin than corn
residues. Taking into account the dry matter yields for top
plants, this would result in 945 and 866 kg ha-1 lignin,
respectively, for soybean and corn plots.

N concentrations 126% higher and, theoretically,
lignin concentrations 113% higher would result in a
greater amount of basic substrate for the formation of hu-
mus in the soybean-corn succession, according to the
main humus synthesis pathway, among the four theories
cited by Stevenson (1994). In this pathway, the polymer-
ization of polyphenols from lignified sources to quino-
nes, and the condensation of the latter with amino com-
pounds, results in nitrogen polymers with complex struc-
tures and which are resistant to biodegradation, charac-
teristically similar to compounds of the C-HA fraction.
Although no difference was observed between C-HA con-
tents in the corn-corn and soybean-corn successions
(Table 2), the higher yield of humic compounds, associ-
ated with the clayey character of the soil under study (590
g kg-1 clay), still explain the higher SOM contents in the

soybean-corn succession. Compounds in the C-HA frac-
tion can become complexed to mineral colloids and not
be extracted with the alkaline solution, thus forming the
humin fraction (C-H) of SOM (Hatcher et al., 1985; Rice
2001). This argument is supported by the fact that among
the organic fractions, the only difference (P &amp;lt;0.01) be-
tween crop successions was observed for C-H contents,
with an average value of about 13% between both soil
depths (Table 2).

The C-H fraction represents compounds closely
linked to soil mineral colloids; in addition to their charge
density, relatively smaller than in other SOM humified
fractions, the C-H fraction is highly cross-linked (Hayes
&amp;amp; Himes, 1986), which imparts to the SOM a high resis-
tance to degradation, so that a vast variety of enzymes
or a single highly-versatile enzyme are required for an
effective mineralization process (Rice, 2001). Also, ac-
cording to Mendonça &amp;amp; Silva (2004), the mean residence
time of organic compounds associated with the soil min-
eral fraction is positively correlated with the surface area
of the minerals. At last, the greater SOM stability in the
soybean-corn succession explains the greater SOM con-
tents found in them. Sousa &amp;amp; Melo (2003) did not ob-
serve differences in SOM and C-H contents between a
biennial corn-fallow-soybean-fallow succession and an
annual corn-fallow succession, after four years of study
in conventional and no-till systems. Gregorich et al.
(2001), using the 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic reso-
nance technique, observed greater amounts of aromatic
C in soils of corn grown in rotation with legumes, in re-
lation to monoculture corn, which suggests that a higher
amount of compounds similar to or derived from lignin
was supplied to the soil organic C in the first system.

In general, for both crop successions the C-H
fraction was predominant in the SOM, followed by com-
pounds from the C-HA and C-FA fractions, which had
similar percentages, and by the C-WS fraction (Figure 2).
In Brazilian clayey-textured Oxisols, the major part of the
SOM consists of the C-H fraction (Volkoff et al., 1978;
Nascimento et al., 1991; Mendonça &amp;amp; Rowell, 1994),
while the proportion between the C-HA and C-FA frac-
tions is variable, and a greater amount of C-FA is gener-
ally observed in relation to C-AH (Volkoff et al., 1978;
Nascimento et al., 1991; Mendonça &amp;amp; Rowell, 1994). In
samples of a loamy-textured Typic Hapludox, Yagi et al.
(2003) observed that the C-H fraction represented about
58% of SOM, and the C-HA fraction was predominant
over the C-FA fraction. The higher C supplies found in
more humified SOM fractions reflect the physical and
chemical stability of organomineral complexes and of al-
kaline-soluble humic substances (Bayer et al., 2002).

The SOM contents, as well as the contents of the
C organic fractions, were higher in the 0 to 20 cm layer,
as compared with the 20 to 40 cm layer (Table 2). How-
ever, the reduction of SOM and C in the organic fractions



Yagi et al.378

Sci. Agric. (Piracicaba, Braz.), v.62, n.4, p.374-380, July/Aug. 2005

was not proportional to depth increase. While there was
a decrease of about 33% in SOM from the 0 to 20 cm
layer to the 20 to 40 cm layer, the percentages of de-
crease of C-WS, C-HS, C-FA, C-HA, and C-H were
about 22%, 22%, 17%, 30%, and 37%, respectively, in
those layers. The differences in the amounts of C-HA
and C-H in the SOM between the evaluated depths could
be associated with the synthesis of compounds that make
up those fractions in the layer nearest to the surface, due
to the constant additions of crop residues, both before
and during the experimental period. On the other hand,
the compounds in the C-FA fraction are less polymer-
ized, have a smaller molecular weight and, mainly,
greater reactivity than the compounds in the C-HA frac-
tion, due to the higher number of carboxylic groupings
that exist in their structures (Stevenson, 1994), favor-
ing complexation with sesquioxides and silicates, and
consequently the protection against microbial attack and
maintenance in the system (Mendonça &amp;amp; Rowell, 1994;
Yagi et al., 2003).

A reduction was observed for the C-HA/C-FA ra-
tio, from 1.18 at the 0 to 20 cm depth, to 0.96 at the 20
to 40 cm depth (Table 2), in a similar way as observed
by Nascimento et al. (1991) and Mendonça &amp;amp; Rowell
(1994), who also studied the effects of cultivations on the
SOM fractions. The HA/FA ratio usually decreases with

depth (Stevenson, 1994), because of the greater mobility
of compounds in the C-FA fraction in relation to those
in the C-HA fraction in the soil (Mendonça &amp;amp; Rowell,
1994).

There was an interaction between nitrogen
sidedressing and crop successions on the C-WS fraction
(Table 2). Nitrogen fertilization did not affect the C-WS
contents in the soybean-corn succession; the N effect was
quadratic in the corn-corn succession, and the dose
equivalent to 176 kg ha-1 N would lead to the maximum
theoretical C-WS content of about 0.10 g dm-3, or the
equivalent to 200 kg ha-1 of this form of organic C (Fig-
ure 3). In the soybean-corn succession, the effect of N
doses on the C-WS contents was null, probably due to
the contribution of N from the legume residues. With re-
gard to the mean C-WS contents in the soybean-corn suc-
cession, nitrogen fertilization in the corn-corn succession
increased C-WS contents at the doses of 120, 180, and
240 kg ha-1 N by about 15%, 24%, and 12%, respectively
(Figure 3). The results obtained for this organic fraction
could be the evidence of a priming effect, that is, theo-
retically the application of inorganic nitrogen or fresh or-
ganic material to the soil stimulates microbial activity and
the mineralization of N forms present in SOM (Jansson
&amp;amp; Persson, 1982). Water-soluble carbon reflects the ini-
tial stage of degradation of organic residues in the soil,
by which insoluble materials are hydrolyzed to amino ac-
ids and soluble sugars (Sousa &amp;amp; Melo, 2003). However,
Duda et al. (1999) previously observed a negative and sig-
nificant correlation (r = -0.84*) between C forms ex-
tracted with water, at a 1:2 soil:extractor ratio and min-
eralizable carbon, obtained through an incubation assay,
indicating that both are controlled by soil biological ac-
tivity. Sousa &amp;amp; Melo (2003) found higher nitrogen con-
tents in the SOM water-soluble fraction (N-WS), ex-
tracted by a method similar to the one used in the present
study, in treatments that included legumes in crop rota-

tion. According to the same authors, the compounds in
the N-WS fraction are readily assimilable, or can be found
in similar forms, and can be used as a source of energy
by microorganisms, due to the limiting amount of C in
those plants.

The carbon contents in the C-HS fraction were
affected by the interaction between sidedressing N doses
and crop successions (Table 2); the data could not be fit-
ted to polynomial regression models (Figure 4). The un-
defined trend for the C-HS contents could be associated
with the distinct results obtained for the C-HA (Figure
5a) and C-FA (Figure 6) fractions, which make up this
fraction.

Nitrogen sidedressing increased the mean C-HA
contents (Table 2). An alternation between crop succes-
sions at higher C-HA contents was observed in both suc-
cessions (Figure 5a). Sousa &amp;amp; Melo (2003) did not ob-
serve differences between C-HA contents at the depth
from 0 to 20 cm, in the corn monoculture and soybean
rotation production systems. Nascimento et al. (1991)
studied soil tillage methods and cropping systems and
observed an effect of the interaction of both factors on
the C-HA contents in the 15 to 20 cm depth layer. Ac-
cording to these authors, a combination between a plough/
scarifier and the soybean-corn succession, during four
consecutive years, resulted in C-HA contents about 61%
and 23% higher than in treatments with a heavy harrow
and no-till in the same crop succession, respectively, and
about 27% higher than monoculture corn and soil tillage
using a scarifier.

For both crop successions, the effect of nitrogen
fertilization on C-HA contents was quadratic, and maxi-
mum theoretical contents of 1.49 g dm-3 C-HA at a dose
of 149 kg ha-1 N in the soybean-corn succession, and of
1.67 g dm-3 C-HA at a dose of 240 kg ha-1 N in the corn-
corn succession were observed (Figure 5a). The C-HA
decrease in the soybean-corn succession after application
of a 149 kg ha-1 N dose could be associated with the N
supplied by the soybean crop residues. The urea-released
ammonia may be complexed with phenols and quinones,
producing compounds with similar characteristics to the
compounds of the C-HA fraction (Stevenson, 1994)
which in part could explain the obtained results. The pe-
culiar characteristics of phenols and quinones complexed
with ammonia include high chemical stability and resis-
tance to microbial decomposition (Nommik &amp;amp; Vahtras,
1982). The results obtained in the present study are simi-
lar to those reported by Tan et al. (1972), who observed
a significant correlation (r = 0.82 **) between total ni-
trogen contents in the soil and C-HA contents. The C-
HA content was higher at the 0 to 20 cm layer, even as a
consequence of total organic C content, and also in-
creased as N doses increased, at both depths (Figure 5b).

Nitrogen sidedressing only affected the C-FA
contents in the corn-corn succession, where the values
best fitted the quadratic regression model (Figure 6). The
regression equation allowed us to observe that the maxi-
mum theoretical C-FA content, about 1.42 g dm-3, would
be obtained with the application of about 67 kg ha-1 N.
In the treatment without nitrogen fertilization, the C-FA
contents were similar in both crop successions, and ni-
trogen fertilization promoted great variability in those
contents between crop successions, alternating higher and
lower contents at each fertilization level (Figure 6). In the
no-till system, Sousa &amp;amp; Melo (2003) observed that corn
grown in rotation with soybean presented higher C-FA
contents at the depth from 0 to 5 cm, in relation to mo-
noculture corn, while in the conventional system there
was no difference between corn production systems. The
unstable character of the compounds that make up this
fraction, which sometimes present themselves as synthe-
sis precursors, and sometimes as products from the de-
composition of compounds that constitute C-HA (Tate III,
1987), and the fact that in the present study the carbohy-
drates in this fraction were not separated (Stevenson,
1994), may justify why the results did not present a clear
trend.
