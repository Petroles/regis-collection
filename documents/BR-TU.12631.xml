ABSTRACT 

 

This report presents the conceptual model, the mathematical model and the computed results 

that allowed the quantification and mapping of the contaminant flow discharge of the illegal waste 

dumped in Alemoa area, at Santos Estuary, in Brazil. The physical data of the dumpsite was presented 

in terms of geology, hydrogeology, altimetry, evaporation and precipitation. From the results it can be 

concluded that groundwater and contaminant discharge of the Alemoa’s wastes to Santos Estuary are 

mainly directed to the drains. Contaminant discharge of dumpsite to the Estuary was calculated in 

1 750.49 mg/yr for benzene, 533.10 mg/yr for toluene, 8 247.04 mg/yr for lead and 646.03 mg/yr for 

cadmium.

CONTAMINANT TRANSPORT MODELLING IN THE ALEMOA AREA AQUIFER ON SANTOS 
ESTUARY BASIN 

(Deliverable 2.7 : Santos Estuary – Groundwater Quality Modelling) 

1 Introduction 

ECOMANAGE project aims to push the capacity of assisting managers to join horizontally 

knowledge from ecological and socio-economic disciplines. The three key aspects of ECOMANAGE are the 

consideration that: (1) a coastal zone depends on local pressures, but also on pressures originated in the 

drainage basin, transported mostly by rivers and by groundwater; (2) socio-economic activities are the 

driving forces of those pressures and that their impacts on the ecosystem have feedback on socio-

economics; and, (3) the impacts depend on physical characteristics of the ecosystem that together with the 

loads determine its ecological state.  

Three coastal zones showing conflicting interests between urban, industrial and agricultural 

pressures and environmental maintenance have been selected for developing the system. The selected 

areas are: Aisén Fjiord in Chile, Bahía Blanca estuary in Argentina and Santos estuary in Brazil.  

The purpose of this deliverable is to report on the groundwater flow and contaminant transport 

modelling of the sedimentary aquifer at Alemoa area system for Santos Estuary basin. That allowed the 

evaluation of the contribution of the contaminant loads from the aquifer system at Alemoa’s dump to the 

Estuary, on steady state conditions. 

There was not enough quantitative data about contamination at Santos Estuary Basin. The illegal 

waste dumped in Alemoa area was the first modelling approach chosen to represent quantification of 

diffuse pollution loads, discharging to the Santos Estuary. 

The model was developed using the following software: Ground Water Modelling System – GMS, 

with the modules MAP, MODFLOW, PEST, MODPATH, and MT3D.  

2 General Description 

The dumpsite is placed at Alemoa quarter, one of the oldest of the city of Santos, in the coast of the 

State of São Paulo, Brazil. This area is inside of the limits of the Santos Port, where today is located an 

important industrial complex, with patios and deposits of containers used to transport loads to and from the 

Santos Port. 

The area of this study is about 917 174.2 m2, and in its neighbourhood predominates terminals of 

liquid granaries storage and small commerce. The Alemoa’s dump is located inside the Estuary Basin area, 



Deliverable 2.7 – Santos Case Study Area  ECOMANAGE

in the "Unidade de Gerenciamento de Recursos Hídricos" (Water Resources Management Unit) nr 7, called 

"Bacia Hidrográfica da Baixada Santista" ("Baixada Santista" Hydrographic Basin). 

The dumpsite includes part of the land area that contributes with fresh water (flows at the surface or 

underground) to the Santos Estuary (Fig. 1).

Figure 1 – Map localization of the study area 

 

The Alemoa’s dump was used for more than 50 years as a disposal for solid waste related to the 

operation of Santos Port and domestic waste illegally dumped in the area. Beyond these activities, the area 

was used to store and move explosives on the access bridge made of armed concrete built in the extremity 

of the land, on the implantation of seedbed of workmanships for the magnifying of the wharf in the stretch 

Valongo-Paquetá and from the material dragged during the activities of implantation of Petrobras´ terminal.  

According to exposition scenes, the area was considered by ASTM 1739/95 as a type 1 scenario 

associated with immediate risks. This classification was determined once the area fits in the affirmation “A 

sensible habitat (e.g. mangrove, Atlantic Forest, etc.), environmental protected areas or sensible receivers 

(species economically important, species in danger or threatened species) are impacted or affected” 

(ESSENCIS, 2005).

3 Groundwater Conceptual Model 

3.1 Introduction 

A groundwater flow model was developed for the sedimentary aquifer. The conceptualization was 

based on the physical system, its geometry, geology and hydrogeology. The conceptual model also 

comprises groundwater recharge estimation and water budget understanding. 

The area for modelling was defined in AutoCAD, using lithologic and hydrogeologic information of 35 

boreholes. As a boundary condition for the sedimentary aquifer, it was considered the crystalline interface 

at -25 m deep. To delimitate this area a topographic map (AGEM, 1:1 000) was used. The data was used to 

produce a grid with 10 m x 10 m cells representing the elevation surface.  

 

3.2 Geology and Hydrogeology 

The geology of the area may be grouped into the basement formations (Palaeozoic and Pre- 

Cambrian) and Cenozoic cover (marine and mixed sediments). 

The basement formations are the result of several tectonic phases, responsible for deformation, 

faulting, foliation, besides metamorphism and magmatic processes, combined with variations of climate and 

sea level. Inland, several faulting and epeirogenesis have produced the escarpment of the actual Serra do 

Mar. In the Cenozoic, the main events may be summarised in topography modelling, tropical humid climate, 

sea transgression and deposition of the sedimentary sequences (MANCUSO and LOBO-FERREIRA, 

2007). 

Data from hydraulic conductivity in the area was estimated as a function of the lithology (siltic clayey 

deposits): Kx, Ky, Kz = 0.1 to 0.5 m/d. Groundwater levels have been monitored for mapping of the 

piezometry (ESSENCIS, 2005). Groundwater levels are almost at surface and vary from 0 to 4 m elevation 

(Table 1). 

 

3.3 Groundwater Recharge 

Groundwater recharge, for modelling purpose (R = 678 mm/year), was estimated as 28.2% from 

precipitation (MANCUSO and LOBO-FERREIRA, 2007).

4 Groundwater Mathematical Model 

4.1 Introduction 

The total area modelled is 917 174.2 m2 and comprises part of São Vicente island. 

The mathematical groundwater flow model used in this study was MODFLOW. MODFLOW was first 

published by MCDONALD and HARBAUGH (1988). The flow model was developed considering flow as a 



ECOMANAGE Deliverable 2.7 – Santos Case Study Area 
 

LNEC - 0607/17/15488 5 

steady state, with lakes and the channel considered as constant head cells. Rivers were simulated as 

drains. 

Considering the lithology, a two layers model was defined, with both layers on the porous aquifer. 

The bottom elevation of the first layer is -3.5 m, and the second is -25 m, so the first layer has a thickness 

of 4 m until 10 m. 

 

4.2 Grid 

The 3D model grid starts at the World Coordinates X = 361 606.269 m, Y = 7 352 826.235 m and Z = 

-25 m, ending at X = 362 878.551 m, Y = 7 354 058.188 m and Z = -25 m. The model has two layers 

subdivided into 123 rows by 127 columns. Each cell is 10 m by 10 m long in the xx and yy directions (Table 

2). The thickness for layer 1 varies according to the topography.

4.3 Layer Attributes 

A layer was built to input recharge, hydraulic conductivity and a boundary in Modflow Model. The 

hydrogeological characterisation was accomplished using the geometry and hydraulic data from the 

geological formations.  

 

4.4 Source/Sinks Attributes 

Surface water from river, drains and Santos estuary was represented as drains, river and constant 

head on Modflow model. The drains were represented on the first layer as a partially penetrating water 

system. The river was represented as an interception system for groundwater flow, and the Santos estuary 

has been represented as a constant head and a fully interception system for groundwater flow. Considering 

the purpose of this work, the groundwater and sea water interaction was not simulated. The constant head 

boundary at 0 m allowed quantifying mean groundwater discharge from the sedimentary aquifer.

4.5 Groundwater Recharge 

Calibration was obtained using recharge values of 678 mm/year. 

 

4.6 Hydraulic Conductivity 

Hydraulic Conductivity was obtained using an inverse model, named Modflow 2000 PES Process. 

This program adjusts a user-defined set of input parameters until the difference between the computed and 

observed values is minimized.  

Figures 2 and 3 presents the parameters adopted by Modflow 2000 PES Process to obtain the 

hydraulic conductivity in Alemoa’s dump.

4.7 Results 

The objective of the model calibration is to obtain a piezometric surface compatible with observed 

heads. In the Alemoa area, the groundwater flows towards the river and the drains opened according to the 

development needs from urban and Santos Estuary.  

Water budget showed that flow in and out from the system are almost the same, with a discrepancy 

minor than 0.001%. According with the model results, total discharge from groundwater is 1 714 m3/d, 

542 m3/d (24%) flows to the Estuary, 1 106 m3/d (56%) to the drains and 66 m3/d flows to the river (Table 

3).

5 Particle Trajectory 

The particle trajectory was estimated using Modpath Processor. Modpath was originally created by 

David W. Pollack (1989) and uses the output files generated by Modflow model to calculate imaginary 

particle flow paths in the groundwater of the system. 

Figure 4 presents the particle trajectories computed with Modpath Processor, representing the flow 

path using a dark blue arrow. The arrows in colour show the flow field obtained with Modflow model.

6 Results Computed with the MT3D Mathematical Model 

The mathematical model used to represent the contamination plume was MT3D. The model was 

published by Zheng and Wang (1999) and it is used to calculate the transport of a contamination plume by 

solving the transport equations.  

Four setups of the transport models were developed to assess the contamination plumes of 

benzene, cadmium, lead and toluene for a period of 100 years. The input data used by this model followed 

the same procedure used for Modflow model.

The concentration of contaminants obtained in each observation well has considered a constant load 

into the aquifer, which causes the contamination plume. Table 4 shows the concentration of contaminants 

used in each observation well for MT3D model development.

The development of the MT3D model allowed the assessment of groundwater contamination, and 

the computation of contamination loads flowing into rivers, drains and the Santos Estuary.  

The contaminant balance showed that the contamination flow, in and out from the system, is almost 

the same, with a discrepancy smaller than 0.001%. Table 5 presents a synthesis of contaminant discharge 

to Santos Estuary, and Figures 5 to 8 and Tables 6 to 9 present the mass budget in 100 years for Benzene, 

Toluene, Cadmium and Lead.

7 Conclusions 

This Report presents a first approach for the evaluation of contaminant discharges from the illegal 

waste dumped in Alemoa area into Santos Estuary, in Brazil. It was based only on existing data. It is 

important to collect new data to improve this first modelling approach. 

Considering the existing data, the contaminant transport model allowed the simulation of advection 

and dispersion into the aquifer system. The final aim was the quantification of diffuse pollution loads, 

discharging to the Santos Estuary. 

From the results it can be concluded that the contaminant discharge of the Alemoa’s dump to Santos 

Estuary are mainly directed to the drains, i.e. the values of directly flowing groundwater diffuse pollution into 

Santos Estuary are smaller than those values flowing to drains. Contaminant discharge of dumpsite to the 

Estuary was calculated as 1 750.49 mg/yr to benzene, 533.10 mg/yr to toluene, 8 247.04 mg/yr to lead and 

646.03 mg/yr to cadmium.  

 

The authors do suggest this research work to be further improved. This requires additional detailed 

field information, becoming available in terms of piezometry, inventory of wells, contaminant monitoring 

data, risk assessment, geophysical data, and hydraulic characterisation and remediation techniques 

alternatives studies.
