abstract
The

Multiferroic materials, that exhibit both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic
properties, have attracted considerable interest in the scientific community due to its
potential for novel applications in electronic devices as well as for physics and
materials science underlying its multifunctionality. In multiferroic composites, the
coupling magnetoelectric is due to elastic interaction between ferromagnetic and
ferroelectric phases caused by the piezoelectric and magnetostrictive effect.

The strategy of this work encompass: i) the preparation of porous thin films of
ferroelectric barium titanate; ii) the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles to be
incorporated in the previous porous films and iii) the functionalization of the
ferroelectric porous matrix aiming to fabricate multiferroic nano composite. The
composite system BaTiO3-CoFe2O4 was chosen due to the piezoelectricity of
BaTiO3, thus allowing strong elastic interaction between the two phases, and good
magnetostriction of CoFe2O4. For materials synthesis, easy, environmental friendly
and cost effective methodologies were adopted: i) evaporation induced self-
assembly (EISA) assisted by dip-coating to prepare porous ferroelectric matrix; ii)
hydrothermal synthesis to prepare magnetic nanoparticles and iii) electrophoretic
deposition for functionalization.

The BaTiO3 thin films were obtained using polystyrene-poly(ethylene oxide)
block co-polymer (PS-b-PEO) as template to create porosity. The effect of a
polymer with different molecular weights (Mw) in the creation of porosity,
concentration of block co-polymer, type of annealing and withdrawal rate of the dip-
coating were studied in this work. The porous microstructure of BaTiO3 thin films
were studied by SEM. Decomposition of the solvents and BaTiO3 crystallization was
studied by DTA/TGA. The topography and piezoelectric behaviour of porous films
was analysed by AFM/ PFM.

CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were obtained by hydrothermal synthesis. The effect of
temperature and time of the hydrothermal synthesis, the addition of
polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as additive with different concentrations, and effect of
precipitating (NaOH) and Co2+/Fe3+ concentration were studied in order to prepare
nanoparticles with desired size and magnetic properties. The shape, size,
dispersion and crystallinity of the nanoparticles were studied by various techniques
such as TEM, BET and XRD. The crystallite size was calculated by Scherrer
equation. The magnetic properties were evaluated by SQUID magnetometer. The
results show that with the increase of temperature and time synthesis the particle
and crystallite size increases too. The saturation magnetization depends of particles
size, increasing with particle size increase. The increasing particle size from 12.9 to
16.1 nm provokes an increase in saturation magnetization from 53.7 to 73.2 emu/g.
In time of hydrothermal synthesis studies, it was observed that a antiferromagnetic
phase appear, hematite (?-Fe2O3). The presence of this phase damaged drastically
the magnetic properties to 8.2 emu/g in the case of a sample prepared over 24 h.
The PVP addition does not affect the shape of nanoparticles however favours their
growth from 20.1 to 23.6. In term of magnetic properties, no influence was
observed. The increase of Co2+/Fe3+ and NaOH concentration induces growth of
nanoparticles.

The functionalization of BaTiO3 films was made by electrophoretic deposition
(EPD). Initially, the process optimization was necessary by studying the different
parameters related with deposition such as: applied voltage, deposition time and
suspension type. This studies permits to conclude that with time increasing, the
amount of nanoparticles deposited increases too. It was observed that, despite the
optimization of EPD, it is important the use a good quality substrate that can afford
voltage application.

resumo Materiais multiferróicos são por definição materiais que exibem simultaneamente
propriedades ferroelétricas e ferromagnéticas. Dado o seu potencial de aplicação tanto
nos em dispositivos electrónicos existentes como em novos dispositivos devido ao seu
carácter multifuncional, os materiais multiferróicos têm atraído consideravelmente o
interesse da comunidade científica. Infelizmente os materiais multiferróicos existentes
são raros e exibem propriedades bastante inferiores às necessárias para a sua
aplicação. Assim é absolutamente fundamental desenvolver materiais multiferróicos
compósitos. Em compósitos multiferróicos, o acoplamento magnetoelétrico deve-se à
interação elástica entre as fases ferroelétrica e ferromagnética causada pelo efeito
piezoeléctrico e magnetostritivo.

A estratégia deste trabalho engloba: i) a preparação de filmes finos porosos de
titanato de bário ferroelétrico; ii) a síntese de nanopartículas magnéticas para serem
incorporadas nos filmes porosos e iii) a funcionalização da matriz ferroelétrica porosa
visando fabricar um nano compósito multiferróico. O sistema composto BaTiO3-CoFe2O4
foi escolhido devido à piezoeletricidade do BaTiO3, permitindo uma interação elástica
forte entre as duas fases, e boa magnetostrição do CoFe2O4. Para a síntese dos
materiais, foram adotadas metodologias simples, de baixo custo e amigas do ambiente:
i) a evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) assistida por dip-coating para preparar a
matriz ferroelétrica porosa; ii) síntese hidrotermal para preparar nanopartículas
magnéticas e iii) deposição eletroforética para a funcionalização dos filmes porosos.

Os filmes finos porosos de BaTiO3 foram obtidos utilizando o co-polímero em bloco
poliestireno-poli(óxido de etileno) - PS-b-PEO para criar a porosidade. Foram estudados
os efeito da variação: i) do peso molecular do co-polímero; ii) da concentração do co-
polímero em bloco; iii) do tipo de tratamento térmico e iv) da taxa de retirada da
deposição por dip-coating. A microestrutura porosa dos filmes finos de BaTiO3 foi
estudada por SEM. A decomposição dos solventes e a cristalização do BaTiO3 foram
seguidas por análises térmicas. A topografia e o comportamento piezoeléctrico dos
filmes porosas foram analisados por AFM/ PFM.

As nanopartículas de CoFe2O4 foram obtidas por síntese hidrotermal. Foram
estudados o efeito da temperatura, do tempo da síntese hidrotermal, da adição de
polivinilpirrolidona (PVP) como aditivo em diferentes concentrações, e os efeitos da
concentração do agente precipitante (NaOH) e dos iões Co2+/Fe3+ com o objectivo de
preparar nanopartículas com tamanho e propriedades magnéticas adequadas. A forma,
o tamanho, dispersão e cristalinidade das nanopartículas foram estudados através das
técnicas TEM, BET e XRD. O tamanho da cristalite foi calculado pela equação de
Scherrer. As propriedades magnéticas foram avaliadas por medidas de magnetização
de SQUID. Os resultados mostram que aumento da temperatura e do tempo da síntese
hidrotermal contribui para o aumento do tamanho da partícula e da cristalite. A
magnetização de saturação aumenta com o aumento do tamanho das partículas. O
aumento do tamanho das partículas de 12.9 para 16.1 nm provocou um aumento na
magnetização de saturação de 53.7 para 73.2 emu/ g. Nos estudos do tempo de síntese
hidrotermal observou-se o aparecimento de uma fase antiferromagnética, hematite (? -
Fe2O3). A presença desta fase prejudicou drasticamente as propriedades magnéticas –
8.2 emu/ g, no caso da amostra preparada durante 24 h. A adição de PVP não afecta a
forma das nanopartículas no entanto favorece o seu crescimento de 20.1 para 23.6 nm.
Relativamente às propriedades magnéticas, nenhuma influência foi observada. O
aumento da concentração de Co2+/Fe3+ e de NaOH induz o crescimento de
nanopartículas e, consequentemente, aumenta a magnetização de saturação.

A funcionalização dos filmes de BaTiO3 foi feita por deposição eletroforética (EPD).
Inicialmente, foi necessária a otimização do processo, estudando os diferentes
parâmetros relacionados com a deposição, tais como: tensão aplicada, tempo de
deposição e tipo de suspensão. Este estudo permitiu concluir que, com o aumento do
tempo, a quantidade de nanopartículas depositadas também aumenta. Observou-se
que, para fazer EPD, é importante o uso de um substrato de boa qualidade que seja
estável à aplicação de tensão.

1. Introduction

In 60’s the computers were room-sized while nowadays the personal computers have 9

mm of thickness, Figure 1.1.

Figure 1.1 50 years old computer [1] (left) and 2000's notebook [2] (right).

Moore’s law, in 1965, predicted the exponential increase of the power density

associated with a decrease of size and power consumption of integrated circuits [3]. In the last

decades “More and More Moore” has been the trend. However Moore’s law is now reaching

the limit and making power management and development of multifunctional materials for

new devices an essential requirement of the microelectronic industry. Within this context,

multiferroics can have an important role because of the simultaneous conjugation of electric

and magnetic properties in the same physical volume, allowing the electric control of the

magnetic response for storage and for processing (Figure 1.2).



CHAPTER #1 | Introduction

Figure 1.2 Scheme of a voltage-controlled write head at a magnetic hard disk track. The magnetic

“write” field is generated by an electric field at the magnetoelectric (ME) material [4].

It should be emphasised that the use of, electric field controlled devices produces much

less Joule heating than magnetic devices switched with a current, allowing an interesting

thermal management [4].

The single-phase multiferroics are rare and exhibit weak magnetoelectric (ME) coupling

or it occurs at very low temperature for practical applications [5, 6]. As an alternative, the

composite multiferroic combining piezoelectric and magnetic phases together in a

heterostructures, show strong direct responses to electric or magnetic fields [7]. However, the

magnetoelectric coupling induced by strain due to piezoelectric and magnetostriction effect is

still relatively weak due to the limitation by the mechanical adhesion of the component

phases.

1.1. Objective

The aim of this work is to develop multiferroic nano composite thin films, exploiting

low cost and environmental friendly chemical based processes for the preparation of

ferroelectric thin films and magnetic nanoparticles. The strategy developed within this work

encompass: i) the preparation of porous thin films, as ferroelectric matrix to be functionalized,

ii) the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles to be incorporated in the previous porous films and

iii) the functionalization of the porous matrix aiming to fabricate multiferroic nano composite

thin films for novel applications in electronics.

2. Review:	multiferroic	materials

2.1. Basic concepts

? Multiferroic materials
The term multiferroic, like the word itself (multi + ferroic), is used to describe materials

that exhibit simultaneously at least two of the three ferroic properties: ferroelectricity,

ferromagnetism or ferroelasticity [8, 9]. From the viewpoint of materials constituents,

multiferroic materials can be divided in two types: single-phase [5] and composite [10] ,

which are described in sections 2.2 and 2.3, respectively.

Magnetoelectric coupling describes the influence of a magnetic field on the polarization

and the influence of an electric field on the magnetization of a material. It may arise directly

from the two order parameters in a single-phase material or indirectly via strain/stress as in

multiferroic composite.

The coupling between the magnetic and ferroelectric order parameters leads to

magnetoelectric effects, in which the magnetization can be tuned by an applied electric field

and polarization can be tuned by an applied magnetic field. Figure 2.1 shows the relationship

between multiferroic and magnetoelectric coupling [9]. Ferromagnets (ferroelectrics) form a

subset of magnetically (electrically) polarizable materials such as paramagnets and

antiferromagnets (paraelectrics and antiferroelectric). The intersection (red hatching)

represents materials that are multiferroic. Magnetoelectric coupling (blue) is an independent

phenomenon that can arise in any of the materials that are both magnetically and electrically

polarizable [9].

Figure 2.1 Relationship between multiferroic and magnetoelectric materials [9].



CHAPTER #2 | Review: multiferroic materials

? Ferroelectricity
Ferroelectricity is a property of materials which exhibit spontaneous electric

polarization that can be reversed by an external electric field [11]. This polarization could be

associated to the movements of cations in relation to anions. When an electric field is applied,

orientation of dipoles creating domains of polarization occurs and this polarization remains

even when the electric field is removed [12]. As the temperature is increased, a ferroelectric

undergoes a phase transition, which is accompanied by the disappearance of spontaneous

polarization due to a change in the symmetry of the crystal lattice. The temperature at which a

phase transition occurs is called Curie temperature, TC.

Most of the known ferroelectric materials have (above Tc) a cubic perovskite ABO3
structure with smaller “B” cations at the centre of the oxygen octahedron and larger “A”

cations at the corner of the unit cell, Figure 2.2. Atoms of Pb, Ba, Ca, Sr typically occupy A-

sites while Ti, Nb, Mg or Ta can be located at the B-site of the perovskite structure.

Compounds like BaTiO3 and PbTiO3 are examples of ferroelectric materials [11-15]. Below

the Curie temperature there is a structural distortion to a lower symmetry phase accompanied

by the off-centre shift of “A” or “B” cations relative to the “O” anions. The spontaneous

polarization of the lower symmetry ferroelectric phase is due to the dipole moment created by

the shift of cations with respect to the anions [16].

Figure 2.2 Crystallographic structure of ABO3 perovskite, adapted from Ref. [17].

The response of ferroelectric domains to an external electric field applied on

ferroelectric material can be described by the so-called ferroelectric hysteresis loop, illustrated

in Figure 2.3.



CHAPTER #2 | Review: multiferroic materials

9

Figure 2.3 Ferroelectric hysteresis loop (polarization vs. applied electric field), adapted from Ref.[16].

Several points of the ferroelectric hysteresis loop are of interest: the spontaneous (Ps)

and remanent (Pr) polarization, the coercive field (Pc) and the general shape of the loop. In a

ferroelectric material, when all of the dipole moments are aligned, the material is considered

saturated since an increase in the applied electric field will not increase more the polarization

(segment b-c). The linear extrapolation of the curve back to the polarization axis ( ?)
represents the spontaneous polarization (Ps). As the applied electric field is reduced from its

maximum positive value to zero, some dipole moments will remain aligned, and a remanent

(Pr) polarization is observed. As the applied electric field spans the range from its maximum

positive to negative values, -Ps and -Pr will be observed (f and g points in Figure 2.3,

respectively). In this state, all of the dipole moments will be switched from the positive to the

negative (up to down arrows) as shown in the blue boxes of the Figure 2.3.

All ferroelectric crystals are necessarily piezoelectric. The piezoelectricity effect is a

phenomenon resulting from a coupling between the electrical and mechanical properties of a

material. There are two types of piezoelectric effect: direct and inverse. In a direct

piezoelectric effect, when a mechanical stress (designated by F in Figure 2.4) is applied to a

piezoelectric material, an electric potential will be generated.



CHAPTER #2 | Review: multiferroic materials

10

Figure 2.4 Direct piezoelectric effect: mechanical stress applied results in a voltage [18].

In case of inverse piezoelectric effect, when a voltage is applied to the piezoelectric, a

mechanical strain will occur (Figure 2.5).

Figure 2.5 Inverse piezoelectric effect: voltage applied results in a deformation [18].

The basic equations 1.1 and 1.2 describe these two effects, respectively, in regard to

electric and elastic properties:

= + Eq. 1.1= + Eq. 1.2
where, D is the dielectric displacement vector, ? is the tensor of dielectric constants

(superscript T indicates a constant stress), E is the electric field vector, d is the tensor of

piezoelectric constants, T is the mechanical stress, S is the mechanical strain tensor and s is

the tensor of mechanical compliance (superscript E indicates a constant electric field) [19].

Piezoelectric materials are utilized in transducers, devices that convert electrical energy into

mechanical strains, or vice versa. Applications that employ piezoelectrics include, among

others, microphones, ultrasonic generators, sonar detectors.

? Ferromagnetism
The elements iron, cobalt and nickel, together with some of the rare-earth elements,

possess at sufficiently low temperature a magnetic moment even in the absence of an applied

field. This property characterised by a spontaneous magnetization is known as

ferromagnetism [20]. Permanent magnetic moments result from atomic magnetic moments

due to electron spin-uncancelled as a consequence of the electron structure. Only atoms with

partially filled shells with unpaired spins can exhibit a net magnetic moment in the absence of

an external magnetic field. Furthermore, in a ferromagnetic material, coupling interactions

cause net spin magnetic moments of adjacent atoms to align with another, even in the absence

of an external field. This mutual spin alignment exists over relatively large volume regions of

the crystal called magnetic domains, Figure 2.6.

Figure 2.6 Schematic representation of domains in a ferro- or ferrimagnetic material. Arrows

represent atomic magnetic dipoles. Within each domain, all dipoles are aligned, whereas the direction

of alignment varies from one domain to another [21].

According to the response to the external magnetic field, the material can be classified

into: ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic [22]. In ferromagnetic

materials, the electron spins are aligned parallel to each other at absolute zero, Figure 2.7.

However, this behaviour depends on the temperature. When a certain temperature is reached

the ferromagnetism completely disappears and the material becomes paramagnetic. This

temperature is called Curie temperature. If the material is cooled above its Tc the

ferromagnetic domains reform and the materials becomes ferromagnetic again. In contrast to

ferromagnetic, an antiferromagnetic behaviour corresponds to an antiparallel alignment of



CHAPTER #2 | Review: multiferroic materials

12

equal moments. Finally, ferrimagnetic behaviour is characterized by antiparallel moments

having different magnitudes.

Figure 2.7 Different alignments of magnetic dipoles. Adapted from Ref.[22].

The application of a relatively small external magnetic field changes the domain

arrangement, and hence induces an appreciable change in magnetization. Both ferro- and

ferrimagnetic materials exhibit a hysteric response to an external magnetic field, as shown in

right side of Figure 2.8.

Figure 2.8 Domain configurations during several stages of magnetization (left side) and

ferro/ferrimagnetic hysteresis loop (right side), adapted from Ref. [21].

During the magnetization of a ferro/ferrimagnetic material, as the applied magnetic field

increases from zero, magnetization value increases from zero and achieves saturation

magnetization, Ms. At this point, all magnetic domains are aligned. While decreasing the

Ferromagnetic Antiferromagnetic Ferrimagnetic



CHAPTER #2 | Review: multiferroic materials

applied field to zero, the original magnetization curve is not retraced, and it remains the

magnetization called remanent or residual magnetization. To decrease the magnetization to

zero, it is required to apply a negative magnetic field with HC value, called coercive field.

When the negative applied field is increased even more, the material achieves saturation

magnetization in reverse field, i.e. all magnetic moments are aligned but in opposite direction

to Ms. Upon removing the reverse field, the magnetization returns to the remanent value. If

the magnetic field is continuously increased the magnetization will saturate again closing the

hysteresis loop.

The size and shape of the hysteresis loop is of considerable practical importance. Based

on the value of a coercive field, magnetic materials are classified into hard for high HC and

soft magnets for small values of HC [20]. Soft magnetic materials are used in devices that are

subjected to alternating magnetic field. It can achieve high magnetization with low values of

magnetic field (i.e. it is easily magnetized and demagnetized). On the other hand, the hard

magnetic materials have high values of coercive field, thus utilized in permanent magnets (for

example memory storage) due to a high resistance to demagnetization.

Similar to piezoelectric effect on ferroelectric materials, if ferromagnetics will have a

mechanical response when a magnetic field is applied, the phenomenon is called

magnetostriction [20]. When an applied field changes a state of magnetization of a

ferromagnetic material, it occurs a small change in its dimensions, provided by two reasons: i)

domain wall migration in response to an external magnetic field and ii) domain rotation. The

linear magnetostriction ? can be defined as

?= ? Eq. 1.3
where l is the original length of the specimen and ?l the magnetostrictive change.

2.2. Single-phase multiferroics

By definition, a single-phase multiferroic shows simultaneously ferroelectricity and

ferromagnetism in a unique compound. There are very few single-phase multiferroic materials

such as BiFeO3 [23-25], BiMnO3 [26-28], YMnO3 [24, 29-31].



CHAPTER #2 | Review: multiferroic materials

14

The most widely single-phase studied multiferroic is bismuth ferrite, BiFeO3 (Figure

2.9) [24, 32].

Figure 2.9 Schematics of the crystal structure of BiFeO3 with polarization arrow in [111] direction

and antiferromagnetic plan (shaded plans) [33].

The structure of BiFeO3 can be characterized by distorted perovskite with rhombohedral

symmetry and space group R3c. The primitive unit cell, shown in Figure 2.9, contains two

formula units (10 atoms in total), arising from counter-rotations of neighbouring O octahedral

about the [111] axis. The R3c symmetry permits the development of a spontaneous

polarization along [111], and Bi, Fe and O are displaced relative to one another along this

threefold axis. Therefore, the ferroelectric state is realized by a large displacement of the Bi

ions relative to the FeO6 octahedra. The Fe magnetic moments are coupled ferromagnetically

within the pseudocubic (111) planes Figure 2.9. If the magnetic moments are oriented

perpendicularly to the [111] direction, the symmetry also permits a canting of the

antiferromagnetic sublattices resulting in a macroscopic magnetization, so-called weak

ferromagnetism [5, 24, 34].

Some studies were carried out about polarization of single-phase multiferroic materials

thin films and bulk. Teague et al. [35] published the first studies of polarization of bulk

BiFeO3 in 1970. These measurements were made at 77 K revealing a spontaneous

polarization of ~6.1 ?C/cm2 along the 111-direction. Nowadays the measured values are

converging to ~90 ?C/cm2 along the [111] direction of the pseudo-cubic perovskite unit cell,

consistent with first-principles calculations made by Neaton et al. [36].

2.3. Composite multiferroics

Composite multiferroics consist of two different phases, a ferroelectric and a ferro-

ferrimagnetic. To date, depending on the architecture of the composite, namely the design of

the interface-connectivity between the two components, three different heterostructures have

been studied: particulate, horizontal and vertical, as represented in Figure 2.10. An

internationally accepted notation, first established for a series of composites by Newnham et

al. [37] helps to describe and distinguish the connectivity character, using the dimensionality

of each phase. Thus, in the particulate case with 0D particles dispersed into a 3D matrix

corresponds to 0-3 connectivity (Figure 2.10a), in the horizontal heterostructure, with 2D

alternating layers correspond to a 2-2 connectivity (Figure 2.10b), while the vertical

heterostructure, with 1D nanopillars dispersed to a 3D matrix, corresponds to a 1-3 structure

(Figure 2.10c).

Figure 2.10 Schematic illustration of three kinds of multiferroic composites nanostructures: a) 0-3

Particulate, b) 2-2 Horizontal heterostructure and c) 1-3 Vertical heterostructure [10].

In 1972, van Suchtelen [38], in an attempt to describe the rising magnetoelectric (ME)

effect in this kind of composites, proposed for the first time the concept of the product

property, using the case of BaTiO3 and CoFe2O4 (equations 1.4 and 1.5). This concept can be

described as a “chain” reaction taking place between the two phases and yields the direct and

the converse ME effect. When a magnetic field is applied, occurs a mechanical strain in the

ferromagnetic phase, subsequently transferred to the ferroelectric one generating polarization

(Eq. 1.4, Figure 2.11a). The second case claims the application of an electric field, which

provokes mechanical strain to the ferroelectric phase and, analogously to the prior case,

evoking magnetization to the ferromagnetic counterpart (Eq. 1.5, Figure 2.11b). The direct

and the converse ME effect can be described, respectively, by the equations [39]:

magnetic layer (purple) and ferroelectric layer (pink). (a) Represents a direct magnetoelectric effect

and (b) represents a converse magnetoelectric effect [10].

2.3.1. Horizontal heterostructures

The horizontal heterostructures, or else 2-2 composites, are the most widely studied,

because they can be easily fabricated layer-by-layer and integrated in the devices. The

thickness of the layers could be modulated at the nanometer level.

The highest ME voltage coefficient ever measured was achieved with laminate mm-

thick Terfenol-D/PZT composites, prepared by conventional methods and reached 4680 mV

cm-1 Oe-1 [40]. However, the ever-increasing demand for miniaturization has led to focus the

investigation on thick and thin films.

Concerning the materials of the current investigation, CoFe2O4 (CFO) and BaTiO3
(BTO), in 2008 Wang et al. [41] grew BTO thin films (260 nm thick) by Pulsed Laser



CHAPTER #2 | Review: multiferroic materials

17

Deposition technique (PLD) on CFO substrates, achieving ME voltage coefficient of 38 mV

cm-1 Oe-1. A little bit earlier the same year, Zhang et al. [42], also using PLD, deposited BTO

and CFO thin films, 70 nm and 20 nm thick respectively, on SrTiO3 (STO) substrates,

achieving ME voltage coefficient of 104 mV cm-1 Oe-1. The viable mechanism of ME

coupling comes from strain-coupling among the piezoelectric and magnetostrictive

components of heterostructure. In case of horizontal heterostructures, the clamping effect of

the substrate effectively suppresses any in-plane strain in the film. Theoretically, this

limitation is minimized in vertical heterostructures if the contact area of the film with the

substrate is lower than the interface area within the composite.

2.3.2. Vertical heterostructures

The most common composition of vertical or 1-3 heterostructures are magnetic spinel

nanopillars embedded into a ferroelectric perovskite matrix, usually epitaxially grown [24].

The high interfacial surface area together with intrinsic three-dimensional heteroepitaxial

character (ferroelectric, ferromagnetic and substrate lattice match) result in strong coupling

between the two ferroic components. The most important advantage of 1-3 heterostructures is

the substantially low mechanical clamping effect related to the lattice constraint from the

substrate.

In 2004, Zheng et al. [7] grew CFO nanopillars of 20-30 nm diameter in BTO thin film

on STO substrate, by PLD technique and proved the magnetoelectric behaviour by detecting a

sharp change in magnetization at the Curie temperature. By the same procedure, Zavalinche et

al. [43] composed CFO nanopillars in 200 nm thick BiFeO3 (BFO) films on STO substrate,

which corresponded to a magnetic susceptibility of 10-2 G cm/V, similar to single crystalline

bilayered composites. More recently, Yan et al. [44] measured ME voltage coefficient of 20

mV cm-1 Oe-1, for CFO/BFO/STO (nanopillar/matrix/substrate) thin films of about 150-240

nm thick.

The vertical heterostructures present in general better ME coupling than the horizontal

structures, however the coupling is still too low for practical uses. It is essential to develop

alternative architectures to prepare multiferroic composite thin films that can ensure a good

control of the interfaces between ferroelectric and ferromagnetic phases.

3. Strategy	of	this	thesis

3.1. Introduction

As discussed before, the actual multiferroic composite architectures show low

magnetoelectric coupling. The aim of this work is the development of an alternative

architecture of multiferroic composites using simple and low cost methodologies. This

alternative architecture consists of a porous thin film as ferroelectric matrix

functionalized with ferromagnetic nanoparticles (Figure 3.1).

Figure 3.1 Porous ferroelectric matrix functionalization with ferromagnetic nanoparticles.

The inspiration to this proposal comes from the use of lyotropic liquid-crystal

phases as templates to develop porous structures [45]. These materials have ordered and

porous structure with high specific surface areas and can be interesting matrices for the

preparation of multiferroic composite with large interface areas. The idea is to prepare

porous ferroelectric thin films, which would be later functionalized with ferromagnetic

nanoparticles to form a multiferroic composite material.

3.2. Porous ferroelectric thin films

Traditionally porosity is undesired in electroceramics because it usually degrades

the electrical and mechanical properties of the material. However, for certain applications,

porosity may be an advantage, such as for pyroelectric applications where is required a

material with piezoelectric properties but at the same time with low dielectric constant.



CHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis

22

Sensors and actuators are some examples of potential applications [13, 46-50].

Furthermore, these porous structures can be seen as an avenue to achieve lighter materials

giving the opportunity to further use the voids to incorporate other functionalities in the

same volume. This is the case of the present work. Porous thin films can be interesting to

develop multiferroic materials, by incorporating ferromagnetic nanoparticles in the pores

of a ferroelectric matrix.

Thin films can be prepared through a great number of different techniques (Figure

3.2). However, only some of them are able to produce porous thin films. The physical

deposition techniques are preferred in order to prepare dense thin films and chemical

deposition approaches are much more appropriate to the preparation of porous layers.

Figure 3.2 Various processing methods used to prepare porous thin films [51].

From chemical deposition techniques, spin-coating and dip-coating are commonly

used in electronics and optics industries for instance, to prepare inorganic layers from sol-

gel solutions. Each technique has advantages and drawbacks. For example, dip-coating, in

which the substrate is successively dipped into the solution and withdrawn at a constant

speed, offers a good control of the thickness and produces no waste. However, the spin-

coating is preferred if one wants only one face to be deposited.



CHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis

23

Some reported works describe the preparation of porous films by dip-coating and

spin-coating [13, 48, 49, 52-54].

To obtain an optimised pyroelectric response of a material (figure of merit),

porosity as been considered since it will decrease the dielectric constant [49]. Porous lead

zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films were prepared by spin-coating of sol-gel solutions [48,

49, 52]. The porosity was generated by using a polymer and could be controlled by using

polymers with different molecular weights. Stancu et al [52] studied two different ways to

produce porous films by spin coating: (1) hydrolysis of precursor solution and (2) the

addition of organic macromolecular polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). In case of hydrolysis,

the authors suggested that the porosity should develop when either the water or the

solvent has been removed during the pyrolysis step. For PVP case, the pores were

produced after pyrolysis of PVP, which was realised at high temperature. The

ferroelectric properties of the porous PZT films were compared to the equivalent dense

PZT films and the properties were by far lower. The dielectric permittivity decreases from

348 for dense film to 48 for porous films. Later, Stancu et al. [48] published another

study describing the effect of porosity on ferroelectric properties of PZT films. In this

work, the authors prepared porous films with addition of different amounts of PVP. The

pore size increased by increasing the amount of polymer added to precursor solution and

this fact has an effect on the final film thickness. The addition of PVP makes the starting

solution more viscous leading to an increase of thickness after crystallization. The pores

size increased with increasing PVP, and lead to a high shrinkage of the film during

crystallization annealing. The electrical measurements showed that the presence of

porosity in the films leads to a lower capacitance and lower dielectric constant. The

authors suggested that these films are good candidates for pyroelectric applications due to

its lower permittivity (characteristic property). The porosity in these films is completely

random.

The group of C. Sanchez have reported several papers on the fabrication of metallic

and multimetallic oxides porous thin films [13, 46, 47, 53, 54]. The methods used to

obtain porous thin films are evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) combined with

dip-coating of sol-gel solutions. EISA can be described like the conjugation of two

cooperative effects. During the evaporation of the sol-gel solution containing the

inorganic precursors and surfactant, the self-assembly of inorganic species occurs around

the surfactant micelles leading to mesophase formation, Figure 3.3.

Ref. [47].

The as-prepared thin films are xerogels where the organic template are embedded

into the inorganic matrix. The thermal treatment step is necessary after the deposition due

to three important facts: i) it conducts to the stabilization of the mesophase, ii)

decomposition and elimination of the organic phase creating the porosity and iii)

crystallization of the network (Figure 3.4). The crystallization occurs through nucleation

and growth of crystallized seeds and is followed by diffusive sintering if sufficiently high

temperature is maintained long enough. A fast nucleation leads usually to a large number

of seeds created homogeneously into the inorganic network. Their subsequent growth into

nanocrystallites is made by diffusion of the adjacent atoms towards the nucleus surface to

occupy atomic sites of lower energy.

inorganic network crystallization, adapted from Ref. [47].

A. Fisher et al. [53] prepared well-ordered nanoperforated TiO2 layers by EISA

combined with dip-coating and studied the effect of molecular weight of surfactant on the

pores size. The higher molecular weight surfactants originated the biggest pores. The

authors suggest that the formation of such systems is possible through the precise balance

of the interactions between the surfactant micelles, inorganic precursors, solvent phase

and interfaces (film/air and film/substrate) during the different steps of evaporation

drying and thermal treatment.

Investigation of dip-coating of various sol-gel solutions using different withdrawal

speed conditions were reported by Faustini et al. [54]. At low withdrawal speeds, the film

thickness is governed by the interdependence of continuous evaporation of the solvent at

the meniscus and the capillary rise at the drying line. At high speeds, the final thickness is

mainly dependent on the viscous drag. At intermediate speeds, both phenomena, overlap

and a critical speed, were found. Furthermore, a thickness lower limit exists that cannot

be overcome, except by dilution of the initial solution i.e., thinner films can be obtained

with high diluted solutions and/or by using at ultralow withdrawal speeds.

More recently, P. Ferreira et al. [13] reported the first study on synthesis and

measurements of ferroelectric properties of porous PbTiO3 (lead titanate - PTO) and

BaTiO3 films. The thermal processing used to convert the amorphous porous

mesostructured multimetallic oxide thin films into a crystalline perovskite film is a key

point to achieve both size and shape monodispersity in particles and pore sizes and in

keeping nanoporosity. The obtained films showed piezoelectric and ferroelectric

response, measured at the nanoscale. The authors suggested that these films are highly

promising as platforms to construct multifunctional ordered distributed composite

materials in which the original architecture of the pores are filled just before

crystallization.

PZT and PTO are both good ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials, but they have

lead in their constitution, which is a non-environmental friendly element. Nowadays, the

scientific community has been paying special attention to develop substituents for lead

based materials – the so-called lead-free materials. BTO is a good example of lead-free

ferroelectric material. It is a well-know ceramic capacitor dielectric material for electronic

industry due to its high dielectric constant [11].

Like referred in section 2.1-Ferroelectricity, BTO is a ferroelectric material with

perovskite structure, Figure 3.5. Eight atoms of Ba2+, one atom of Ti4+ and six atoms of

O2- compose the BaTiO3 unit cell.?

polarization upon the application of an electric field.

Figure 3.6 shows 3 different phase transitions of barium titanate. The arrows

indicate the direction of polarization. Above the Curie temperature, BTO crystal

possesses cubic structure (space group Pm3m). Below the Curie temperature (120°C), the

crystal turns into tetragonal (P4mm). Between 5°C and -90°C the structure is

orthorhombic (Amm2), and rhombohedral (R3m) below of -90°C.

rhombic and d) rhombohedral cell [15]. The arrows indicate the direction of spontaneous

polarization (Ps).

The cubic structure is the only one does not show ferroelectric properties and it is

paraelectric because the vibrations in the cubic structure promotes the random

displacement of Ti4+ ion around its central position, there does not show any asymmetry

or polarization. In the case of the tetragonal system, Ti4+ ion and the octahedral

arrangement of O2- ions move asymmetrically causing a permanent electric dipole

moment in the unit cell. Knowing that the oxygen octahedra are coupled, the

neighbouring unit cells will also be polarized yielding domain structures. These domains

are characterized by small volumes of material in which the electric dipole moments are

aligned in the same direction.

3.3. Ferromagnetic nanoparticles

Magnetic nanoparticles have attracted tremendous attention due to their novel

properties and their potential applications in magnetic recording, magnetic storage,

biotechnology and biomedicine [55, 56]. For example, in the case of magnetic recording

applications a large remanent magnetization and moderate coercivity is required [57]. For

some of these mentioned applications of magnetic nanoparticles, the soft ferrites, such as

magnetite and maghemite, are thought to be the most suitable [20]. Cobalt ferrite,

CoFe2O4, is a hard ferrite and displays some interesting characteristics in order to

compose a multiferroic material: good chemical stability, high magnetocrystalline

anisotropy and large magnetostriction [20, 58]. The saturation magnetostriction (?s) of

various materials at room temperature is given in Table 3.1.

The high values of saturation magnetostriction of SmFe2 and Terfenol D are due to

the highly anisotropic shapes of Sm and Tb ions and to the large lanthanide-iron exchange

energy. Comparing the cases of magnetite and cobalt ferrite, the high magnetostriction in

materials containing cobalt is due to the presence of the Co2+, from which there is a large

orbital contribution to the magnetic moment and hence a strong spin-orbit coupling,

which increases the magnetostriction. The properties of cobalt ferrite depend on the

morphology and preparation method.

Some methods have been studied to obtain magnetic nanoparticles such as: co-

precipitation [59, 60], thermal decomposition [61-63], micro-emulsion [64-66],

solvothermal and hydrothermal synthesis.

? Co-precipitation

Co-precipitation, or wet chemical route is a facile way to synthesize iron oxides

composed from aqueous ionic salt solutions by the addition of a base under inert

atmosphere at room or elevated temperature. However, after the precipitation an

annealing step is necessary to crystalize the material. The particles prepared by co-

precipitation tend to be rather polydisperse and with low magnetic properties when

compared with other processes. Zhang et al [59] prepared CoFe2O4 nanoparticles by co-

precipitation method. The authors studied the effect of base concentration (NaOH) and

annealing temperature. They observed that for high concentrations of NaOH and higher



CHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis

annealing temperatures the crystallite size was higher. The results obtained are

summarised in Table 3.2.

The lower magnetization of samples obtained with 4.8 M of NaOH and annealing at

200 and 300 °C can be related with the presence of Fe2O3 and ? - Fe2O3 and an outer layer

with thickness around 10 nm appearing on the surfaces of each nano-particle. The

products annealed above 600 °C showed that most particles have sizes larger than 100

nm, but they were polydisperse.

? Thermal decomposition

Thermal decomposition is the decomposition of organometallic compounds in high-

boiling organic solvents containing stabilizing surfactants. The typical surfactants are

fatty acids [61, 62] or PVP [63]. The size and morphology of magnetic nanoparticles

could be controlled by the ratio of the starting reagents including organometallic

compounds, surfactant, and solvent. An annealing step is needed in order to obtain

crystalline material. Cabrera et al. [61] synthesized cubic nanoparticles of MFe2O4 (M=

Fe, Co and Mn) by thermal decomposition of Fe(III), Co(II) and Mn(II) oleates. The

authors observed that the size of ferrite nanoparticles could be controlled by varying the

amount of metal-oleate complex in the reaction mixture. The particle size was

proportional to the concentration of metal-oleate. For the case of CFO, the morphology of



CHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis

30

the particles changed from cubic to spherical with modification of Co-oleate

concentration. This fact is related with the growth rates. Faster growth rates lead to

spherical Co ferrite nanoparticles. Therefore, high concentration of metal cations is

responsible for faster growth rates. Cobalt ferrite with mean size 12 nm shows 54 emu/g

of saturation magnetization at 5 K and 50 emu/g at 290 K.

? Micro-emulsion
A micro-emulsion is an isotropic and thermodynamically stable single phase

formed by at least three components; two of them are non-miscible, and the third one,

called surfactant, is characterized by amphiphilic properties [65]. Depending on the

proportion of suitable components and on the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance value of the

surfactant used, it occurs the formation of microdroplets can be in the form of oil in water

(O/W) or micro-emulsion of water in oil (W/O). In W/O microemulsions, the aqueous

phase is dispersed as microdroplets surrounded by a monolayer of surfactant molecules

[67]. The size of the micelle is determined by the molar ratio of water to surfactant [66].

By mixing two identical water-in-oil microemulsions containing the desired reactants, the

microdroplets will continuously collide, coalesce and break again, and finally a

precipitate is formed in the micelles. By the addition of solvent, such as acetone or

ethanol, to the microemulsions, the precipitate can be extracted by filtering or

centrifuging the mixture. The micro-emulsion can be named as a nanoreactor for the

formation of nanoparticles.

Liu et al. [68] prepared CoFe2O4 nanoparticles by micro-emulsion method. The size

of nanoparticles (from 4nm to 10nm) was controlled by concentration of the reagents. The

saturation magnetization increased from 15 to 50 emu/g with particle size increase.

? Hydrothermal synthesis

Hydrothermal processing can be defined as a heterogeneous reaction on the

presence of aqueous solvents under high pressure and temperature conditions that allow

the dissolution and recrystallization of materials that are relatively insoluble under

ordinary conditions [69]. When a non-aqueous solvent is used, the process is so-called

solvothermal synthesis [70, 71]. During the hydrothermal treatment metallic cations

initially precipitate in the form of hydroxides. Over time, these hydroxides undergo

dehydration to form the metal oxide crystal structures [72].



CHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis

31

This method is a good alternative to organic decomposition processes from the

environment viewpoint. Moreover, hydrothermal synthesis does not need special water-

and oxygen-free procedures and annealing step to crystalize the products.

Goh et al. [73] prepared CoFe2O4 by hydrothermal synthesis with sizes between

15.6 and 33.1 nm. The size of nanoparticles was controlled by the temperature of

hydrothermal reaction. The saturation magnetization increase with particle size and the

highest value achieved was 73.4 emu/g.

The advantages and drawbacks of each method discussed above are summarised in

Table 3.3. The choice of the appropriate method to synthesize nanoparticles should be

done as a function of the final application. In terms of simplicity and environmental

friendly methodologies, co-precipitation and hydrothermal synthesis are the preferred

routes because only need water-based solutions to prepare magnetic nanoparticles.  The

differences between these two methods are mainly the need of an annealing step in the

case of co-precipitation. Thermal decomposition and micro-emulsion methods involve the

use of organic compounds and the processes are more complex to settle than the co-

precipitation and hydrothermal synthesis. When the shape control is a required aim, the

best methods are thermal decomposition and hydrothermal synthesis. Additives or

different precursor nature could easily control the shape of nanoparticles by favouring the

growth in some crystallographic direction [63, 74, 75]. The shape could also be controlled

on microemulsion synthesis however this method requires a large amount of solvent [76].

Co-precipitation and thermal decomposition are the best studied to prepare

magnetic nanoparticles. Although, due to a high interest in use of simple and

environmental friendly methods, hydrothermal synthesis has been extensively applied the

last years. The following paragraphs are devoted to the review of the hydrothermal

synthesis of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles.

Only a few papers could be found in Web of Knowledge® about hydrothermal

synthesis of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles. The first work reported was in 2003 by Cote et al.

[72] which prepared CoFe2O4 nanoparticles by continuous hydrothermal synthesis.

Important conclusions were achieved. It was found that it is necessary to control pH and

temperature in order to prevent premature precipitation of iron in the reactor. The

presence of a second metal cation was beneficial in controlling the particle formation

process probably by preventing the formation of complex hydroxides when the base was

added to the cold metal salt solution. In this work two variations of the continuous

hydrothermal synthesis were examined – cold mixing and hot mixing [72]. The cold

mixing experiment produced a material with less impurities than the hot mixing one.

Furthermore, a mechanism of particle formation was postulated involving the

precipitation of metal hydroxides at ambient conditions, dissolution of the hydroxides as

temperature was increased followed by rapid precipitation of metal oxides at elevated

temperatures. When the reactants were mixed at elevated temperatures, the mechanism

was simply precipitation of metal oxides due to the addition of the hot hydroxide solution.

In both mechanisms, very fine particles of CoFe2O4 were produced.

In 2004, the effect of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as surfactant in

hydrothermal synthesis was studied by Ji et al. [78]. The products prepared without

CTAB showed an irregular shape and wide size distribution. However, the morphology

changed drastically when the surfactant was applied. Nanorods were formed with the

average size of 120 nm in length and 25 nm in diameter (Figure 3.7A). CTAB is an ionic

compound, which is ionized completely in water. The resultant CTA+ has a positively

charged tetrahedron with a long hydrophobic tail, while the growth unit for CoFe2O4
crystal is considered to be Co–Fe–OH-. Therefore, ion pairs between CTA+ and Co–Fe–

OH- could be formed due to electrostatic interaction. In the crystallization process,

surfactant molecules may serve as a growth controller, as well as an agglomeration

inhibitor, by forming a covering film on the newly formed CoFe2O4 crystal. The

adsorption of species at the crystal surfaces strongly affects the growth rate and

orientation of the crystals. The surfactant molecules in the film tend to be perpendicular



CHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis

to the absorbed surface, and the growth units would tend to face-land onto the growing

interface. Since this kind of landing and dehydration will result in Co–O–Fe bonds, make

this landing mode is predominant in competition with other ones such as vertex- and

edge-landing. CoFe2O4 crystal should grow preferentially and the dehydration steps are

repeated in the following procedures. In terms of magnetic properties, nanorods showed a

very low saturation magnetization (0.083 emu/g). The reason for this low magnetization

was not discussed. More works in hydrothermal synthesis assisted by different

surfactants, in order to change the morphology, were reported [74, 75, 79, 80].

Chen et al. [79] synthesized CoFe2O4 nanoparticles by using polyethylene glycol

(PEG) as surfactant. The shape of particles changed from quasi-spherical to

parallelogram, Figure 3.7C. The addition of PEG improved the crystallite size from 24 to

35 nm. In terms of magnetic properties, the saturation magnetization increased from 29.3

to 36.5 emu/g with PEG addition. Similarly to the work reported by Chen et al., Zhang et

al. [80] studied the effect of different amounts of trisodium citrate (CA) dihydrate

(Na3CA.2H2O), Figure 3.7E. The authors observed that the lattice constant, crystallite

size, shape and magnetic properties could be tuned by changing the masses of

Na3CA.2H2O. The lattice constant increased with Na3CA.2H2O mass increase. However,

the average size of particles increased for masses of surfactant below 1g and decreased

for larger amounts of surfactant. When a large amount of additive was used, the Co2+ and

Fe3+ had finite masses and reacted totally; the extra molecules of additive had no

contribution to the increase of lattice constant. The magnetic properties of the products

are related with lattice constant, size and shape of particles due to the addition of

Na3CA.2H2O.

In addition to the surfactant effect on hydrothermal synthesis, other studies were

carried out in order to understand the mechanism of the method. Goh et al. [73] studied

the hydrothermal synthesis temperature effect on particle size and shape. It was observed

that the shape of CoFe2O4 nanocrystals was transformed from spherical into rod and the

crystallite size increased by increasing the hydrothermal temperature, Table 3.4. The

larger sizes result from coalescence and Ostwald ripening at high temperatures.

Zhao et al. [58] studied the effect of pH of solution and the coexisting cations. It

was found that pure CoFe2O4 could be synthesized at pH 12 and above. To evaluate the

effect of coexisting cations, the authors used LiOH, NaOH and KOH solutions. It was

observed that the final products did not contain Na or K, which indicates that these

cations did not take part in the reaction. In the presence of NaOH and KOH aqueous

solutions the only product was CoFe2O4. However, the product synthesized in LiOH

solution did not match with CoFe2O4. The researchers suggested that Li could form a

spinel compound with formula Li2xCo1-xFe2O4.

Li et al. [81] carried out the magnetic measurements at different temperatures: 10

and 300 K. CFO nanoparticles exhibited high coercive field at 10K and performed

superparamagnetism at room temperature (characterized by very low coercive field),

Figure 3.8.

Figure 3.8 Magnetic measurements carried out at room temperature (a) and 10 K (b), adapted

from Ref. [81].

From this hydrothermal synthesis review, it was conclude that the final product

properties (size, shape and magnetic properties) could be easily controlled by this method.

3.4. Functionalization - Electrophoretic deposition

Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) has attracted special attention of the scientific

community over the last decade due to its high versatility for application for the

preparation of thick or thin films of different materials, substrates and combinations of

materials, its cost-effectiveness and the use of simple equipment [82-85]. It offers easy

control of thickness and morphology of the deposited product by controlling the

processing parameters like voltage and time [85-89]. For all the stated reasons, it is a

good candidate for the functionalization of the porous thin films matrices with cobalt

ferrite nanoparticles.

3.4.1. Introduction

The electrophoresis phenomenon was discovered in 1808 by a Russian physicist F.

F. Ruess, who observed movement of clay particles, suspended in water, due to an

induced electric field [90]. The basic phenomenon involved in EPD for the fabrication of



CHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis

38

ceramics was first researched by Hamaker in 1940 [91]. On the following years and up to

the early 90’s, EPD was mainly researched for the processing of traditional ceramics or

coatings of metal components and very limited work was carried out on the EPD of

materials engineering [84]. More recently, it the last two decades the interest in

electrophoretic deposition increased incredibly, and new applications of advanced

materials have been discovered, denoted by the existence of more than a thousand

articles, patents and four conferences about EPD.

Nowadays, EPD has been studied for several of novel applications like anti-oxidant

ceramic coatings, micro moulds, fabrication of functional films for advanced

microelectronic devices, monolayers of nanoparticles or bioactive coatings for medical

implants [82, 83, 86-89, 92-95].

3.4.2. Basic concepts

Electrophoretic deposition is a colloidal process, which is used for coatings and

fabrication of films. During the EPD process, charged powder particles, dispersed or

suspended in a liquid medium are attracted and deposited onto a conductive substrate of

opposite charge on application of a DC electric field, Figure 3.9. Therefore, are three

basic steps in EPD: (1) formation of a stable suspension of the particles, (2)

electrophoretic migration of the particles to the deposition electrode, and (3) deposition of

the particles in the desired arrangement on the electrode surface [82].

Figure 3.9 Two electrodes cell for electrophoretic deposition showing positively charged particles

in suspension migrating towards the negative electrode [84].



CHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis

39

There are two types of electrophoretic deposition depending on which electrode the

deposition occurs. When the particles are positively charged, the deposition happens on

the cathode - cathodic electrophoretic deposition [96]. If the particles are negatively

charged, the deposition occurs on the anode and the process is called anodic

electrophoretic deposition, Figure 3.10.

Figure 3.10 Schematic illustration of EPD process a) cathodic EPD and b) anodic EPD [90].

During the EPD process, particles get charged and move towards the electrode,

depositing on the electrode. But, how do particles get charge? Four mechanisms of

charging the particles were suggested [97]:

1. A selective adsorption of ions from the liquid onto the solid particle;

2. Dissociation of ions from the solid phase into the liquid;

3. Adsorption or orientation of dipolar molecules at the particles surface;

4. Electron transfer between the solid and liquid phase due to different work

function.

In case of ceramic particles the last mechanism is not applicable but the first two

invariably occur. The sign of the net charge on the particle will depend not only on

whether mechanism 1 or 2 is dominant. Also, a positively charged particle may even

behave like a negative one, which is attracted to a positive electrode, if an excess of

negative ions is attracted to the vicinity of the particles. So it’s difficult to predict whether

a deposition will occur, if on positive or negative electrodes in an unknown system.

The electrical double layer is a very important concept for the surface chemistry of

materials in colloidal science field, like as in EPD. It describes the variation of the electric

potential near a surface, and has a large effect on the behavior of colloids. Development

of a net charge at the particle surface affects the distribution of ions in the surrounding



CHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis

40

interfacial region, resulting in an increased concentration of the counter ions close to the

surface. Apart from the surface charge of the particles, the electrical surrounding double

layer consists of two parts: an inner region called Stern layer, where the ions are strongly

attracted to the particle surface and closely attached to it due to their electrostatic force

and an outer region called Diffuse layer, where the ions are less firmly associated to the

surface and which contains free ions with a higher concentration of the counter ions,

Figure 3.11. In the Diffuse layer is a boundary known as the slipping plane, in which the

particle acts as a single entity [90, 98].

Figure 3.11 Schematic representation of the double layer surrounding a charged particle and

evolution of the zeta potential from the surface potential [98].

The zeta potential is the potential difference between the stationary layer of each

dispersed particle and liquid medium. It can be used to control the stability of the

colloidal suspensions by determining the intensity of repulsive interactions between the

particles. Higher values of zeta potential lead to more stable suspensions. Increasing the

ionic strength can significantly reduce the repulsive forces. The behaviour of particle

separations depends critically on the ionic strength. If the potential energy is high, it

originates strong repulsive forces producing a totally dispersed system [90].

Furthermore, the zeta potential determines the direction and migration velocity of

particles during EPD, according to the negative or positive signal of the charge.

3.4.3. Mechanism of EPD process

Although EPD has been studied over the last decades, the mechanism of the

deposition is not entirely clear. Different theories have been discussed for a possible

mechanism.

The first attempt to explain the phenomenon of EPD was made in 1940 by Hamaker

et al. [99], who suggested that the EPD is mainly a mechanical problem, i.e., the

formation of deposits by EPD is similar to the formation of sediment due to gravitation.

The authors noted that the role of the electric field is only to provide a force, which

presses the particles and moves them towards the electrode.

Grillon et al. [100] suggested that the charged particles would be neutralized upon

contact with the deposition electrode, becoming static to form a deposit and that the role

of the electric field is only to push the charged particles to move towards the electrode.

Due to a "tip effect", the first deposited particles, i.e. those in contact with the substrate,

play the role of poles attracting the other particles, Figure 3.12.

Figure 3.12 Phenomenological model of the electrophoresis of coarse particles [100].

Another mechanism found in literature was the electrical double layer distortion and

thinning mechanism proposed by Sarkar and Nicholson [101]. The authors proposed a

model mainly based on distortion of double layer. When a positive charge particle and its

shell are moving towards the cathode, the double layer is distorted becoming thinner

ahead and wide behind due to the electric field applied, Figure 3.13(a). The cations in the

liquid also move to the cathode along with positively charged particles and the counter

ions behind of the double layer will tend to react with the cations in high concentration

around them, Figure 3.13(b). This chemical reaction reduces the thickness of the double

layer and therefore decreases the zeta potential. When another particle with a thin double

layer is approaching, the two particles come close enough to interact through London Van

der Walls attractive forces and coagulate, Figure 3.13(c).

distortion and thinning [101].

3.4.4. Kinetics of electrophoretic deposition

In order to control and manipulate electrophoretic deposition process according to

desired final product, the understanding of the kinetics of electrophoretic deposition is

highly important.

Hamaker [91] observed a linear dependence of the deposited weight or yield of the

EPD with the amount of charge passed, and proposed that the amount deposited is

proportional to the concentration of the suspension, time of deposition, surface area of

electrode and electric field showed in the following equation:

=? Eq. 3.1
where M stands for the deposited mass in time t(s), ? designates a coefficient which

represents the fraction of particles deposited near the electrode, A represents the electrode

area (m2), C is the particle concentration in the suspension (kg/m3), ? is the

electrophoretic mobility (m2/V.s) and E is the electric field (V/m).

3.4.5. Parameters related with suspension

Concerning the suspension properties to obtain a good deposit by electrophoretic

deposition, many key parameters must be considered, such as the physicochemical nature

of both suspended particle and the liquid medium: particle size, dielectric constant of

liquid, zeta potential and stability of suspension [102]. The effect of each parameter will

be discussed in the following subtopics.

? Particle size

Nowadays, electrophoretic deposition is used from micron to nanoscale. For larger

particles, the main problem is that they tend to settle due to gravity forces. In this case,

the mobility of particles needs to be higher than the gravity force. It is difficult to get a

uniform deposition with a sedimenting suspension of large particles because, will lead to

gradient in deposition, i.e., thinner above and thicker deposit at the bottom in case of

deposition electrode is placed vertically. However, nanoparticles also show some

drawbacks due to their high tendency to agglomerate. The use of solvents and in some

cases additives is necessary to prevent the agglomeration of nanoparticles.

? Dielectric constant of liquid

The behaviour of the dielectric constant of the suspension media was studied by

Powers et al. [103]. The authors used different suspension media of ?-Al2O3 and found

that the deposition did not take place for solvents with dielectric constant below 12 and

above 25. For low dielectric constant, the deposition fails due to insufficient dissociative

power of solvent. In case of high dielectric constant the high ionic concentration in the

suspension reduces the thickness of the double layer and consequently the electrophoretic

mobility.

? Zeta potential and stability of suspension

As mentioned before, the zeta potential is a key factor in the electrophoretic

process. It determines the intensity of repulsive interaction between particles, the

direction (positive or negative) and migration velocity of particle during EPD. A high zeta

potential will confer stability to the suspension and the dispersion will resist to

agglomeration.

3.4.6. Parameters related to electrophoretic deposition process

Not only the suspension properties lead to a good electrophoretic deposition but

also the parameters such as deposition time and applied voltage are very important.

? Deposition time
The effect of deposition time was studied by A. Wu and P. Vilarinho [89]. The

authors observed that the deposition rate decreases for long times of deposition due to an

overall electrical resistance of the film already deposited. So, short times of deposition

favour thick films, while long time deposition leads to decrease the rate due to the

formation of an insulating layer on the electrode composed by the film itself.

? Applied voltage

Besides the studies on the effect of time deposition, A. Wu and P. Vilarinho also

studied the effect of applied voltage [89]. For a fixed time of 2.5 minutes, the thickness of

deposit increases linearly with the applied field. Both results at the time are in agreement

with the Eq. 3.1 discussed in Kinetics of EPD – Section 3.4.4.

4. Experimental	procedure

The experimental procedure of this thesis is divided in 3 parts: i) preparation of

porous ferroelectric thin films: ii) preparation of ferromagnetic nanoparticles and iii)

functionalization of pores of the ferroelectric matrix with ferromagnetic nanoparticles by

electrophoretic deposition, Figure 4.1.

Figure 4.1 Schematic of this work illustrating the functionalization of porous BaTiO3 matrix with

CoFe2O4 nanoparticles by electrophoretic deposition.

4.1. Porous ferroelectric films

To produce porous ferroelectric thin films the experimental procedure proposed by

Ferreira et al. [13] was adopted. It consists in the preparation of BaTiO3 sol-gel solution

and then its deposition in conductive substrates by dip-coating combined with EISA

(Evaporation Induced Self Assembly).



CHAPTER #4 | Experimental Procedure

48

In order to form the pores in the films, template molecules are needed. Typical

templates are surfactant molecules or amphiphilic block copolymers (ABCs), which

consist of a copolymer formed by blocks of polymers chemically different that are

covalently attached to each other. These polymers should be have different hydrophobic

character namely one should be very hydrophobic while the other should be hydrophilic.

They are mostly referred by the abbreviation of their segments and usually a b is put

between them to indicate the block structure. For example, in this work, it is used PS-b-

PEO for polystyrene-poly-(ethylene oxide), Figure 4.2.

Figure 4.2 Structure of monomer of PS-b-PEO block copolymer, adapted from Ref. [104].

By dissolving the ABC in a liquid that is thermodynamically a good solvent for one

of the blocks and a precipitant for the other (called a “selective solvent”), micelles are

formed above the critical micelle concentration (CMC). The inorganic precursors typical

condense around those micelles arrays to form the porous films. In this work the PS is

soluble in tetrahydrofuran (THF), while the PEO is solubilized by the ethanol.

In this work, it was used as block co-polymer polystyrene-poly-(ethylene oxide)

with two different average molecular weight (Mw): a) PS-b-PEO 40000-53000 g mol-1

and b) 58600-71000 g mol-1.

4.1.1. Sol-gel method

For preparation of sol-gel solution, three initial solutions were prepared: A, B and

C. Table 4.1 shows the chemical composition of these starting solutions used to

synthesize BaTiO3 porous films.

* The used polymer weight depends of concentration. Low and high concentrations
correspond to 0.083 g and 0.166 g, respectively.

In order to study the effect of molecular weight (Mw) of PS-b-PEO, two different

Mw were used: Mw = 40000-53000 g mol-1 and Mw=58600-71000 g mol-1. The

molecular weight is related with the number of monomers of polystyrene and

polyethylene oxide (n and m index, respectively, displayed in Figure 4.2) present in a

unique chain of polymer.

The solution containing the block polymer was heated to 70ºC for 10 minutes to

allow the complete dissolution of polymer in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Then, 2.28g of

ethanol were added drop-by-drop under magnetic stirring at 25 ºC. The solution B, the

barium precursor was dissolved in acetic acid and heated to 70 ºC for 60 minutes to allow

the total dissolution of Ba(OH)2.8H2O. In third solution, acetylacetone was added to

titanium precursor and stirred for 45 minutes at room temperature and then ethanol was

added drop-by-drop. To achieve the final sol-gel solution, solutions A, B and C were

mixed, at room temperature, in the following sequence: first solution C was added into

solution B drop-by-drop under stirring. After 15 minutes, the new solution (B+C) was

dropped into solution A. The sol-gel solution was kept under stirring several minutes

before dip-coating process.

4.1.2. Dip-coating and EISA

The films were deposited by dip-coating (Figure 4.3) with different values of

withdrawal rate (15.58, 29.58 and 96 mm/min) onto 10 × 25 mm sized slides of

multilayer (Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si) wafers from Ramtron. Before deposition the substrates were

cleaned by ultrasonics agitation in ethanol and acetone, 5 minutes each one.

Figure 4.3 Deposition of porous BaTiO3 film by dip-coating.

The solutions preparation and deposition was done at approximately 30% of relative

humidity and 25 °C. The dip-coater used is from KSV model DC/D/LM. After deposition,

BaTiO3 films were treated in air up to 400 °C for 5 minutes in order to complete de

inorganic condensation of the matrix and to decompose the organic parts of the precursors

and copolymer template. Then, the films were annealed for 6 minutes at the desired

temperatures of crystallization. Above 700 °C the calcination time was 2 minutes in order

to avoid the elimination of the porous by the high growth of BaTiO3 grains. The

annealing temperatures were chosen according to the results from Differential Thermal

(DTA) and Thermogravimetry (TGA) analyses.

Due to the porosity and in order to avoid humidity and gases adsorption, the films

were involved in filter paper, placed in Schlenk and maintained under nitrogen

atmosphere until further characterization or functionalization, Figure 4.4.

4.2. Cobalt ferrite nanoparticles – Hydrothermal synthesis

The CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by hydrothermal synthesis, a water-

based environmental-friendly process. In typical synthesis, 0.1 mol of Co2+ : 0.2 mol of

Fe3+ : 0.01 mol of NaOH : 0.55 mol of H2O. The starting precursors, Co(NO3)2.6H2O

(Sigma-Aldrich, purity 98%) and Fe(NO3)3.9H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, purity ? 98%) with

Co:Fe ratio=1:2 were dissolved, under magnetic stirring, into distilled water to achieve

mixed aqueous solutions. The pH in this step was between 1 and 2 (the equipment used

for pH measurements was WTW model pH330i). In some cases, to study the effect of the

additive in final properties of CoFe2O4, different concentrations of PVP (Aldrich, Mw =

1300000 gmol-1) were added to the reaction mixture. Two aqueous solutions of PVP were

prepared with the concentration of 5% (%w/v) and 10% (%w/v). In this case, 2 mL of

these mother solutions were added by substitution of the same volume of H2O –

corresponding to PVP5 (solution of 5% of PVP) and PVP10 (solution of 10% of PVP).

After 15 minutes the precipitating agent, NaOH (eka), was added drop-by-drop under

stirring and a dark brown solution was achieved with at pH=13. Different concentrations

of NaOH were used in order to study the effect on the morphology of the nanoparticles.

The solution was kept under stirring for one hour. Then, it was transferred to a Teflon-

lined stainless steel autoclave, Figure 4.5A.



CHAPTER #4 | Experimental Procedure

Figure 4.5 (A) 30mL autoclave used for hydrothermal synthesis and (B) oven equipped with

mechanical stirrer.

The autoclave was placed into an oven equipped with rotation system Figure 4.5B.

The rotation speed was the same for all syntheses, 35 RPM. Different temperatures and

times of hydrothermal synthesis were used to study and optimize the process. According

to the aim of this thesis, deposition of nanoparticles in the pores of BaTiO3 films, the

control of size and shape of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles is required. Initially the effect of the

synthesis temperature were studied. Then, the best temperature was used to study the time

effect. In the end the additive effect, NaOH and metal ions concentrations were studied.

After hydrothermal synthesis, the dark powders were collected from the bottom of Teflon

vessel and were washed by ultracentrifugation with distilled water and ethanol. The

ultracentrifugation equipment used was Beckman model L8-70M. Initially the powder

was washed under 10.000 RPM but at this velocity the nanoparticles tend to agglomerate

due to high centrifugal forces. In order to avoid this problem, a study was developed to

achieve the best velocity to minimize the nanoparticles agglomeration. The ideal velocity

was 7.500 RPM. The drying step was made at room temperature. The final powders were

stored in glass vials.

4.3. Films functionalization – Electrophoretic deposition

The functionalization step involved firstly optimization of electrophoretic

deposition, namely in terms of solvent to ensure monodispersion of nanoparticles.

Five suspensions were prepared in a glass beaker with 0.2 mg mL-1 of CoFe2O4
nanoparticles. Distilled water, ethanol (Panreac, purity P.A.), acetone (Carlo Erba, purity

P.A.), n-hexane (Sigma-Aldrich, purity ? 99%) and n-butanol (Sigma, purity &gt; 99%)

were tested. A further dispersion of the suspension was conducted by using ultrasonics

agitation in equipment Bransonic (70 W and 42 kHz) for 1 hour and then 15 seconds in

ultrasonic sonar from Bandelin model Sonoplus HD 3100. The stability of the

suspensions was studied by two simple methods: by observation of the suspension colour

over the time and by UV spectroscopy.

For the EPD optimization, bare substrates of 10 × 25 mm were used (the same as

used for dip-coating of porous BaTiO3 thin films. In this step, studies on effect of applied

voltage and deposition time were carried out.

Finished the EPD optimization, the best parameters were chosen to functionalize

porous BaTiO3 thin films, Figure 4.6.

4.4. Characterization

4.4.1 X-rays diffraction (XRD)

X-ray diffraction was a very useful technique in this work, enabling a qualitative

analysis of the crystalline phases in the porous BaTiO3 thin films, CoFe2O4 nanoparticles

and composite films. This technique is a versatile and non-destructive.

By exposing a crystalline sample to a X-ray beam, some of those X-rays are diffracted

according to a certain angle (2?) matching characteristic crystallographic directions of the

material as given by the “Bragg’s law” [105]:

=2 sin Eq. 4.1
where is the wavelength of X-rays, is the angle between the incident rays and crystal

surface, d is the spacing between layer of atoms.

In the present project, the X-rays diffractions were performed using Philips X-Pert

MPD equipment with Cu-K? X-radiation and = 1.5406 Å. The sweeping angles used

for identification of the crystalline phases present in BaTiO3 thin films were from 20 to

60°2? and for CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were 20 to 80°2?, both with a step of 0.02°2? at

room temperature. For phase identification through the X-ray diffraction peaks, an

integrated database of Powder Diffraction Files (PDF4+) from the International Centre of

Data Diffraction (ICDD) was used.

Through the broadening of the X-ray diffraction peaks, crystallite sizes of less than

~0,1 ?m could be conveniently measured [106]. The crystallite size of CoFe2O4 was

calculated by Scherrer equation:

= Eq. 4.2
where ? is the breadth usually expressed as the full width at half maximum peak

(FWHM), K is a constant to account for particle shapes (close to unity, usually 0.9 for

spherical shapes), ? is the wavelength of the X-rays, L is the crystallite size and ? is the

diffraction angle. The broadening is also affected by instrumental factors. Such factors



CHAPTER #4 | Experimental procedure

55

have to be subtracted to correctly calculate the crystallite size. To measure the

instrumental broadening a crystalline material in which the broadening is negligible can

be used. In this case, the instrumental broadening was determined with a crystalline

lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6). The peaks used for crystallite size measurements were at

2?=30.07 and 35.42°. In these cases, new X-rays diffractions were measured between 28

and 38° 2? in order to obtain more defined peaks allowing a good crystallite size

measurements.

4.4.2 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)

Scanning Electron Microscopy was used in this project to reveal the microstructure

of porous BaTiO3 thin films and composite thin films. An electron gun generates a beam

of electrons inside a vacuum column, which is then focused and driven to collide with a

target, the sample. [107] An image is possible due to the electronic signal generated by

the low angle backscattered electrons, which are created by electron interactions with the

material surface [108].

The SEM equipment used was Hitachi® model SU-70. This microscopy has

magnifications from ×30 to ×800.000 and acceleration voltage in range of 0.1 to 30 kV.

The sample holder has 5-axis motorized: displacement in X and Z-axis, shift in Y,

rotation (360°) and tilt (-5 to 70°). The tilt is an important characteristic because it allows

the tilt movement in cross-section of Ramtron substrate and of porous BaTiO3 thin films

allowing a good view and measurement of thickness of the films. The potential

acceleration used was 7kV. This equipment is also equipped with microanalysis system

for energy dispersive spectrometry of X-rays/EDS from Bruker model Quantax 400.

For samples preparation, the porous BaTiO3 thin films and composite thin films

were glued in typical SEM sample-holder with carbon tape. This preparation method

allows the reutilization of the films for other characterization techniques or future

functionalization.

4.4.3 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) has the same operation principle of

SEM, but in this case the electrons are accelerated at a much higher potential to pass

through the sample towards the detector below it. The electrons, passing through the



CHAPTER #4 | Experimental Procedure

56

sample, which has to be very thin to allow it, are either absorbed or dispersed changing

their directions. This dispersion is influenced by the atomic arrangement of the material.

Afterwards, they are focused again, amplified and projected in a fluorescent screen or in a

monitor. This technique allows observing the CoFe2O4 shape and size. The average size

of nanoparticles was determined by measuring 150 particles of each sample assisted by

software ImageJ version 1.46r. The size distributions were determined by Gaussian curve.

TEM was done in Hitachi® model H9000 with an acceleration potential of 300 kV.

The CoFe2O4 nanopowders were suspended in n-hexane (Sigma-Aldrich, purity ? 99%).

The powder was added slowly into n-hexane under ultrasonics agitation and kept for 1

hour. Then, a droplet of the suspension was deposited in a holey carbon micrometric

copper grid from Agar Scientific®.

4.4.4 Differential Thermal and Thermogravimetric Analysis

(DTA/TGA)

Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) is a technique that permits to know the

thermal behaviour of a material and the transformations it goes through as temperature

increases. It is done by heating up the material, registering its temperature difference

between material and an inert one (standard sample, normally pure alumina), which is

being heated simultaneously. The temperature difference (in µV) is then plotted against

the temperature of the furnace. Positive differences between them indicate exothermal

transformations, while negative ones denote endothermic phenomena.

It is usual to record the weight variation with temperature during DTA, with a

technique called thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). This provides additional information

about the transformation that is occurring, by overlapping the weight loss curve (TGA) as

a function of temperature together with the thermal energy curve (DTA).

These techniques were used to evaluate the BaTiO3. The sol-gel solution was dried

at 60°C for 48h and then milled in a mortar . The equipment used was Setaram model

Labsys™ TG-DSC16. The analyses were done by heating the powder from room

temperature to 800°C at rate of 10°C/min under flowing air.

4.4.5 Specific Surface Area (ABET) and Porosity Measurements

obtained from the 77 K N2 Isotherms

Adsorption measurement based on the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) isotherm is

the most widely used for the determination of the specific surface area of a powder or

porous materials [109].

This measurement is done using N2 adsorption at 77 K, by putting a solid material

of a known mass in contact with a known volume of gas, it adsorbs creating a decrease in

the pressure, from which the amount of adsorbed gas can be calculated. From these

measurements a plot of the amount of gas adsorbed versus the relative pressure (P/P0, P0
being the saturation vapour pressure of the adsorption gas used) is represented, which is

called the adsorption isotherm. According to IUPAC 1985, the shapes of adsorption

isotherms are classified into six groups. Type I isotherm is given by a microporous solid

having a relatively small external surface. In contrast, type II isotherm represents

unrestricted mono/multilayer adsorption on a non-porous or macroporous adsorbent. Type

IV isotherm shows a characteristic hysteresis loop and the limiting uptake at high P/P0:

these features are associated with capillary condensation taking place in mesopores. Type

VI represents stepwise multilayer adsorption on a uniform non-porous surface. Type III

and V are associated with weak adsorbent - adsorbate interactions. The BET equation that

can be applied to the isotherm curve, which is only valid for lower values of p/p0 and is

used in this form [110]:

( ) = + Eq. 4.3
where V is the volume of gas adsorbed, Vm is the monolayer volume and C is a constant.

By this procedure, the Vm can be calculated (from the slope and the intercept) and applied

in Eq. 4.4 to calculate the surface area [110]:

= Eq. 4.4



CHAPTER #4 | Experimental Procedure

58

where ABET is the surface area, NA is the Avogadro number, ? is the area of an adsorbed

gas molecule and V0 is the volume of 1 mol of gas at STP (Standard Temperature and

Pressure).

The equipment used was Micromeritics® - Gemini 2370 V5. N2 gas was used as the

adsorption gas and liquid N2 to cool down the samples. The samples were degassed at

200?C overnight. These measurements allowed the determination of specific surface area

of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles.

4.4.6 Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM)

Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) has been a fundamental tool in high resolution

characterization of metals, semiconductors, dielectrics, polymers and biomolecules.

Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM), the most popular technique of ferroelectrics

characterization via SPM, allows a nondestructive visualization of domain structures in

thin films at the nanoscale [111].

PFM technique is based on the detection of local piezoelectric deformation of the

ferroelectric film, which is induced by the application of an external AC voltage

(V=V0.cos?t, where V0 is the vibration amplitude and ? the frequency) via a conducting

cantilever tip. A standard lock-in technique is used by measuring the vertical mechanical

displacement of the cantilever tip, as seen in Figure 4.7, which could be expressed as

?Z=dvV0cos(?t+?), where dv is the effective piezoelectric constant and ? the phase

difference between the applied voltage V and the piezoresponse, therefore indicator of the

polarization direction.

Figure 4.7 Schematic illustration of vertical PFM signal detection, adapted from Ref. [111].



CHAPTER #4 | Experimental procedure

59

However, apparent electrostatic components result in high complexity of

piezoresponse detection in thin films. In addition, the presence of porosity  (necessary for

the subsequent functionalization) in combination with the low thickness (&lt;200 nm) is

responsible for making very difficult the process of characterization. The main reasons

for the absence of publications in literature concerning the porous thin film piezoresponse

characterization (with the exception of P. Ferreira et al. 2012 [13]) are: low quantity of

deposited matter, inhomogeneity and preferential orientation of organized domains

provoked by the substrate compliance interactions and unidirectional contraction of the

domains due to the required thermal treatment [46].

Piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM) analyses were carried out in a modified

atomic force microscope in PFM mode Nanoscope III, Digital Instruments, using silicon-

SPM sensor with Al coating tips (NANOSENSORSTM model PPP-NCHR-20, l = 125 ?m,

resonant frequency of 204 – 497 kHz, force constant of 10 - 130 N/m). The topographic

images of the film surface were taken simultaneously with the domain images and were

collected in non-contact mode.

4.4.7 Superconductor Quantum Interference Device (SQUID)

The superconductor quantum interference device (SQUID) was used to measure the

magnetic properties of the CoFe2O4 nanoparticles. In a SQUID magnetometer, the sample

moved through the external magnetic field. A pickup coil is linked to a superconducting

loop with parallel Josephson junctions (Figure 4.8). A magnetic flux from the moving

sample interrupts the superconducting loop. An applied bias current establishes the

superconducting loop and indicates the magnetism of the sample [112].

Figure 4.8 Schematic illustration of the superconducting loop with parallel Josephson junctions,

[113].



CHAPTER #4 | Experimental Procedure

60

The measurements were performed by varying the magnetic field at constant

temperature (typically 10 K, but the same experience was made for other fixed

temperature from 10 to 300 K) and by fixing the magnetic field (10 Oe) and changing

temperature from 0 to 400 K. The equipment used was Quantum Design – MPMS from

Centro de Física Matérica Condensada- Faculdade de Ciências from University of

Lisbon.

5.1. Porous ferroelectric thin films

In order to study the effect of different parameters on the microstructure of porous

thin films, 6 different samples were prepared. The parameters studied were: a) the effect

of type of annealing (with or without ramp); b) the molecular weight (Mw) of the block

co-polymer PS-b-PEO: Mw = 40000-53000 gmol-1 or 58600-71000 gmol-1; concentration

of block co-polymer and the withdrawal speed during the deposition. The designations of

samples and their parameters are shown in Table 5.1.

5.1.1. Effect of experimental parameters on porous

microstructures of thin films

? Effect of type of annealing

In order to study the effect of the type of annealing, firstly, DTA/TGA

measurements (Figure 5.1) were done to know the temperature of BaTiO3 phase

crystallization and decomposition of organic content of the films.

Figure 5.1 Differential thermal (DTA) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of BaTiO3 dried

sol-gel solution illustrating the pyrolysis of co-polymer and other organic compounds up to 500

°C and BaTiO3 crystallization above of 600°C.

The TGA curve (blue line) shows the weight loss during the heating. The major

weight loss occurs up to 450 ºC. This weight loss corresponds to the decomposition of the

organic components of precursors, solvents and pyrolysis of block co-polymer PS-b-PEO

(creating the porosity in the BTO film). It should be noted that the block co-polymer

decomposes in two steps corresponding to the degradation of the two polymer blocks.

According to literature [13], poly(ethylene oxide) decomposes around 200 ºC while

polystyrene decomposes at ca. 280 ºC. Above of 450 ºC no other remarkable weight loss

was observed.

Here two different types of annealing were studied: (1) 5 minutes at 400 °C

(without ramp) and (2) ramp with heating rate 10 °C s-1 and plateau of 5 minutes at 400

°C. It was observed that the films should not age on the substrate as damage of the

microstructure may occur.

In Figure 5.2, it is shown the effect of calcination type (with or without ramp) for

porous thin films prepared with the block co-polymer with both Mw (samples C1 and

C8). It can be observed that the type of annealing does not affect the porous

microstructure for both thin films prepared with the block co-polymer with different Mw

(40-53 k or 58.6-73 k gmol-1). Both films present a porous microstructure free of cracks

or other defects. Due to this observation, the following studies were only carried out with

? Effect of polymer Mw
In order to study the effect of Mw of the block co-polymer on porous

microstructure, different molecular weights were used: a) PS-b-PEO 40000-53000 gmol-1

and b) 58600-71000 gmol-1.

In Figure 5.3 the effect of different Mw on porous microstructures can be clearly

observed. The polymer with Mw = 40-53 k gmol-1 produces bigger pores with non-

uniform shape, while the polymer with Mw = 58.6-71 k gmol-1 produces smaller pores

with narrow pore size distribution and uniform shape. Furthermore, the porous thin films

obtained with higher Mw showed a preferential organization in the microstructure, the

pores are well organized revealing hexagonal-like arrays (blue mark). This hexagonal-like

arrays were also observed in nanoperforated TiO2 layers [53] and porous TiO2 thin films

[54].

hexagonal arrangement.

Table 5.2 shows the average of pores size and respective standard deviation (?) of

the films described above. The measurements were carried out using the computer

software ImageJ. 150 measurements were done for each sample in order to achieve a

good sampling. The calculations of average pore size and standard deviation were done

using the software Origin version 8.5. The porous thin films prepared with Mw = 40-53 k

gmol-1 present average pore size of 60.7 nm with ? = 6.2 while the thin films prepared

with Mw = 58.6-71 k gmol-1 present lower average pore size, 28.8 nm, and ? = 2.6. This

low value of ? indicates a narrow distribution of pore size for the high molecular weight

block co-polymer.

block co-polymers described above.

Figure 5.4 shows the comparison of microstructures obtained from different

concentrations of block co-polymer. It is clear that the films obtained from sol-gel

solutions with high concentration of block co-polymer display more connected nanopores

forming elongated pores as observed inside of yellow marked zones. This fact occurs for

both block co-polymers, however in the film obtained from the PS-b-PEO Mw = 40-53 k

gmol-1, the presence of interconnected pores is more pronounced than for the other one.

Figure 5.4 SEM micrographs of porous BaTiO3 thin films prepared with different concentrations

of block copolymer (Mw=40-53 k and Mw=58.6-73 k gmol-1). Low concentration = 0.083 g, High

concentration = 0.166 g.

The formation of elongated micropores is due too a high density of pores obtained

on the samples prepared with high concentration of block co-polymer. In order to

compare the effect of block co-polymer concentration on pore density, for each film, the

number of pores present in a square with a side of 500 nm was calculated by using

ImageJ software. Results are presented in Table 5.3.

*Low concentration = 0.083 g, **High concentration = 0.166 g

It can be clearly observed that the block co-polymer with high Mw gives films with

high density of pores independently of the concentration. The pore walls are much thinner

for Mw = 58.6-71 k gmol-1 than for Mw = 40-53 k gmol-1.

As expected, high concentrations of block co-polymer produces more pores per unit

area. To compare the effect of both Mw, the increase of density was calculated by

following Eq. 5.1:

×100 Eq. 5.1
where ?h is the pores density at high concentration of block co-polymer and ?l is the pores

density of lower concentration of block co-polymer.

The Mw = 40 – 53 k gmol-1 block co-polymer caused an increase of 27.4% on

density while Mw = 58.6-71 k gmol-1 caused an increase of 28.8%. These two values of

increase can be considered similar to each other.

? Effect of withdrawal speed on BaTiO3 thin films thickness
It is known from the literature review that the thickness of thin films prepared by

dip-coating depends on withdrawal speed and annealing temperature [13, 54].

In this work the effect of the withdrawal speed on the thickness of BaTiO3 thin

films was studied by using two different speeds: 15.58 and 96 mm min-1. SEM

micrographs (not shown) prove that the porosity was not influenced by withdrawal speed.

In Table 5.4, the film thickness is presented as a function of the withdrawal speed,

determined from the SEM micrographs cross-sections, for each withdrawal speed.

15.58 (C8) 650 ~110-120

15.58 (C12) 650 ~115-145

*determined by using SEM micrographs of the cross-sections.

Comparing the samples C8 and C30, prepared with withdrawal speed 15.58 and 96

mm min-1 respectively, it was observed that high speeds induce high thickness. Higher

withdrawal speed provokes slow evaporation of solvents inducing high thickness. In this

study, it was observed that the film thickness depends on the block co-polymer

concentration. Samples C8 and C12 were deposited with the same withdrawal speed,

however, the block co-polymer concentration in sol-gel solution is different. However, in

the case of C12 the high concentration of block co-polymer was used, resulting in a

thicker film. This can be justified by an increase of viscosity of the sol-gel solution.

Similar observation was described by Faustini et al. [54], who reported that at high

withdrawal speeds the final thickness of TiO2 films is mainly dependent on the viscous

drag.

As an example, the cross-section of sample C30 is shown in Figure 5.5. The

composition of Ramtron substrate is presented in the following section.

? Evolution of porous thin film microstructure and morphology with

annealing temperature

Like discussed before in section 3.2 – Porous ferroelectric thin films, the thermal

treatment step is necessary after deposition. During this step as evidenced by the

DTA/TGA measurements (Figure 5.1), the decomposition of the organic content of the

films occurs first, followed by the crystallization through nucleation and growth of

BaTiO3 crystallites.

To study the evolution of the microstructure of porous thin films and thickness with

annealing temperature, the sample C8 was annealed at 3 different temperatures: 400 °C

for 5 minutes, 650 °C 6 minutes and 750 °C 2 minutes. At 750 °C the films were treated

only for 2 minutes to avoid degradation of the porosity due to particles growth. The

thickness measurements were carried out on cross-section samples by SEM and are

shown in Table 5.5. The thickness decreases with the annealing temperature due to the

crystallization of the porous BaTiO3 thin films.

? Ramtron wafer characterization

The used substrate from Ramtron was characterized by XRD and cross-section in

SEM because the producer does not give information about the composition of their

multilayer wafers. The composition and thickness of each layer was determined by SEM

assisted by EDS analysis, Figure 5.6.



CHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion

71

Figure 5.6 SEM micrographs of multilayer (Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si) Ramtron wafer cross-section

displaying different layers without any thermal treatment.

EDS spot analysis allowed to determine the composition of each layer of Ramtron

wafer. The major difficulty in this analysis was the determination of the TiO2 layer

probably due to ultra thin thickness. By SEM micrographs, even when assisted by EDS

analysis, is difficult to distinguish the TiO2 layer. The TiO2 layer should be located

between platinum (Pt) and silica (SiO2) layers (please see on the left micrograph of Figure

5.6) in order to ensure the adhesion of the Pt. The thickness of platinum layer was easily

determined. Due to the difficulty in distinguishing the boundary between TiO2 and SiO2
layers, these two layers were measured together as having approximately 450 nm, Table

5.6. Probably, the TiO2 layer is less than 100 nm of thickness.

The observed reflections in XRD patterns of Ramtron wafer could be assigned to

Pt, TiO2 and SiO2 confirming the elements identification of the SEM/EDS analysis.

Furthermore, the peaks in XRD patterns indexed to SiO2 JCPDS 01-073-3415 do not

match in the exact values of 2?, probably due to the presence of layers on the top of the

SiO2. The reflection peaks observed around 2 ? = 55 ° are attributed to substrate and can

be related with forbidden peaks of Si.

for temperatures above of 650°C. For higher temperatures BaTiO3 becomes more

crystalline. No other phases of BaTiO3 or other compounds were detected indicating the

purity of tetragonal BaTiO3 phase. The peaks identified with an S were indexed to

substrate by comparing this XRD patterns with the patterns of Figure 5.7.

5.1.2. Piezoresponse studies

In Table 5.7 and Table 5.8 are displayed the results of the Piezoresponce Force

Microscopy study for different samples.

In the topography images, the dark regions correspond to larger depths, whereas the

lighter ones represent the ones closer to the surface. Thus, the topography image is a

representation of the film surface and, as a first approximation, of the apparent porosity.

In the piezoresponse images, the dark regions correspond to ferroelectric domains

oriented towards the substrate and the lighter ones towards the surface. The dark regions

that reveal large pores in the topography image continue to appear in the PFM image and

they do not correspond to piezoresponse. However, the appearance of different domains

in the PFM image does not necessarily imply the existence of polarization, since a very

deep region (or else high) can present dark (light) domains in the PFM image.

Consequently, a uniform region is preferred for better results. However, such requirement

is difficult to be reached due to the thin porous films’ limitations discussed above. As a

result, lower piezoresponse signal is observed, accompanied by high noise.

In Table 5.7 the evolution of the ferroelectric domains with increasing applied

voltage is presented for the case of sample C1, with a scanning size of 7 ?m. By the

application of 10 V we can observe the appearance of a few ferroelectric domains with

opposite orientation. Increasing voltage results in increased contrast between the already

existent domains. However, apart from the expected low piezoresponse signal, high noise

- clearly observed when no voltage is applied to the sample - weakens even more the

contrast between the domains. Finally, due to the high roughness of the surface there is an

evident deformation of the grain morphology, as observed by the topography image. Such

effects could be explained by an abrupt bend of the cantilever tip when in contact with the

island-like surface, which provokes very dark regions right after the high ones. An

apparent wear of the tip due to this violent interaction results in misrepresentation of the

realistic shape of the grains, conferring them an elliptical geometry.

In Table 5.8 are presented the topography and piezoresponse characterization of

samples C1, C3, C8, C12 and C30 for different scanning sizes and applied voltage. The

fourth column corresponds to the topography image and the last to the piezoresponse

image. The most interesting comparisons to be made are those for varying thickness,

block co-polymer Mw and polymer concentration.

For the study of thickness effect to piezoresponse, taking into account that the

thickness relation between samples was C3 &amp;lt;C1 = C12 = C8 &amp;lt;C30, two groups could be

chosen, keeping in each one the concentration and type of polymer constant, but varying

withdrawal velocity during dip-coating: C1-C3 and C8-C30. Sample C3 corresponds to a

higher deposition velocity than that of C1, therefore being the thinnest film. A higher

contrast between the ferroelectric domains is apparent on the C1 piezoresponse image,

accompanied by an enhanced definition. Such a result was expected, since increased

thickness is related to increased quantity of deposited matter, therefore enhanced

accumulation of dipole components, which yields higher polarization. The second group

does not follow the same behavior, probably due to the combination of the problems

mentioned above.

The use of high block co-polymer Mw results in smaller pores in the ferroelectric

matrix. A representative case for this kind of study is between C8 and C1 samples, since

they have equivalent thickness, but C8 corresponds to the high block co-polymer Mw,

thus smaller pores and enhanced polarization, which can be observed in the piezoresponse

image by a higher number of ferroelectric domains appearing in the case of C8.

Lastly, a higher polymer concentration turns the solution more viscous, which has a

severe effect on the homogeneity of the film thickness, as well as on the elongated pores

as observed before in Figure 5.4. C12 sample was prepared with higher polymer

concentration and, apart from the expected weak piezoresponse, it was very difficult to

characterize, due to its extremely rough surface, which was destroying the cantilever tip

and providing falsified topography and piezoresponse images.

5.1.3 Summary

Porous BaTiO3 thin films were successfully produced by dip-coating combined

with EISA. The effect on the microstructure of different parameters such as type of

annealing, Mw of block co-polymer, concentration of block co-polymer and withdrawal

speed was studied. The type of annealing (with or without ramp) does not affect the

microstructure. High block co-polymer Mw produces small pores and high concentration

of polymer induces the formation of interconnected pores due to high density of pores.

High annealing temperature reduces the pore size and the thickness of the film. High

withdrawal speeds form thick films. These porous structures are good candidates to

pyroelectric applications or future functionalization with nanoparticles composing a

multifunctional material.

5.2. CoFe2O4 nanoparticles

In this section, the results of CoFe2O4 synthesis are shown. The effect of different

hydrothermal synthesis (HS) parameters such as: temperature and time of HS, additive

effect, metal ions and base concentration was discussed.

5.2.1. Synthesis temperature effect

To study the temperature effect, the syntheses were performed under the same

condition but at different temperatures: 100, 150, 200 and 230 ºC. The maximum

temperature is limited to 230 °C due to the limitations of properties of Teflon-lined

autoclave. For all experiments, the autoclave was filled up to 50% of volume. In Figure

5.9 are displayed the TEM micrographs of nanoparticles synthesized at 100 and 230 °C.

Figure 5.9 TEM micrographs of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles obtained from hydrothermal synthesis at

100 °C and 230 °C.

For low hydrothermal synthesis temperature, the nanoparticles present a fog-like

shape, i.e. very agglomerated with none defined particle shape, due to the low

crystallinity of the material [58]. As the temperature increases nanoparticles tend to have

rounded shape and some of them cubic shape. The average sizes of CFO nanoparticles

obtained at 100 °C and 230 °C were about 12.9 nm and 16.1 nm, respectively, Table 5.9.

The sizes were measured in ImageJ software.

The average particle size measured by TEM micrographs is in good agreement with

the crystallite size (Figure 5.10) estimated by Scherrer formula suggesting that each

individual particle is a single crystal. The crystallite size increases from 15.6 to 19.1 nm

with the temperature increase from 100°C to 150°C. This increasing should be due to the

coalescence and Ostwald ripening as observed in previous studies [73]. For HS

temperatures above 150 °C, the crystallite size decreases. This fact could be associated to

a fast nucleation of the nanoparticles at higher synthesis temperature, with formation of a

huge number of nuclei and rapid decrease of the precursor concentration on the medium

preventing crystallite growth [73].

On the left side of Figure 5.10 X-rays diffraction patterns of CoFe2O4 nanoparticle

obtained from different HS temperatures are presented. Single crystalline cubic spinel

phase is formed which is in accordance to JCPDS card no. 04-008-4497. The products

prepared below 200 °C show lower crystallinity than the products obtained at high HS

temperatures.

nanoparticles obtained at different temperatures of hydrothermal synthesis during 1h.

The Figure 5.11 presents the magnetic properties of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles as a

function of HS temperature. All samples exhibit a typical ferromagnetic hysteresis loop.

As the synthesis temperature increases, the saturation magnetization increases from 53,7

to 73,2 emu/g, as expected and in accordance to the high crystalline degree of these

samples. Similar study was carried out by Goh et al [73], where CFO nanoparticles with

sizes between 15.6 and 33.1 nm present saturation magnetization of 56.8 and 73.2 emu/g

respectively.

It could be observed a drop on the magnetization at 10 K when the field is around 0

Oe. This effect was more pronounced for the sample prepared at 100 ºC and became less

significant with the increase of the temperature of hydrothermal synthesis. According to

the literature this may occur due to the presence on the samples of soft magnetic species

such as FeOOH that easily can be formed at low temperature in very small quantity [114].

In the left side of Figure 5.11 is presented the zero field cooling (ZFC) and filed

cooling (FC) curves. The peak of these two curves is called blocking temperature. The

blocking temperature (characterized by blocked magnetic moments) is between 350 and

400 °C for all samples.

nanoparticles show a superparamagnetic behaviour, i.e., very low coercive field [81]. The

coercive field decreases from 11889 Oe (measured at 10 K) to 703 Oe (measured at 300

K). The saturation magnetization decreases from 69.1 to 60 emu/g.

Nanoparticles obtained at 230 °C for 24 h show bigger sizes and cubic shape than

those obtained in short reaction times. However, from the TEM micrograph of

nanoparticles prepared at 230 °C for 24 h, it can be conclude that the size distribution is

not narrow due to the presence of small particles. The average size increases from 16.1 to

28.4 nm when the HS time increases from 1 to 24h, Table 5.11.

All characteristic peaks of CoFe2O4 could be observed in XRD patterns, however,

for longer times of hydrothermal synthesis another crystalline phase was detected,

hematite (indexed JCPDS no. 01-073-3825). This iron oxide is antiferromagnetic [22]

slightly present after 3 hours and clearly observed after 24 hours. The crystallite size

measurements indicate that the crystallite size increases from 16.1 to 20.2 nm with HS

time increase. By comparing the average size of particles measured by TEM micrographs

and crystallite sizes, it can be concluded that the nanoparticles are single-crystals.

Figure 5.15 presents the magnetic properties of nanoparticles against the HS time.

Normally, the Ms increase with particle size [73]. However, it does not happen in

this study. Saturation magnetization decreases drastically from 73.2 to 8.04 emu/g when

the HS time increase from 1 to 24h. This decrease of saturation magnetization is clearly

due to the presence of the antiferromagnetic phase, ?-Fe2O3 detected by XRD. The

blocking temperature is around 390 °C for all samples.

For the aim of this work it was important to obtain monodispersed nanoparticles of

CoFe2O4. For this, it was studied the effect of the addition of different concentrations of

PVP as mentioned in section 4.2. PVP (Figure 5.16) is a water-soluble polymer resulting

from the polymerization of the monomer N-vinyl pyrrolidone. It is a strong Lewis base



CHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion

87

and consequently can interact with other molecules by the formation of hydrogen bonds

or can act as a proton acceptor. These chemical properties give PVP a strong affinity to

bind ions surface, forming a layer, which theoretically avoids further aggregation, acting

as growth inhibitor and dispersant [115]. PVP has been studied as a capping agent in the

preparation of ferrites by thermal decomposition [63, 116, 117]. The authors proposed an

interaction between the metal ions and the nitrogen of PVP. PVP is commonly used to

obtain ferrite fibers by electrospinning because as it interacts with the metal ions, it can

allow the preparation of hollow fibers or it can ensure the preparation of individual fibers

[118, 119].

PVP needs to be done.

Figure 5.18 shows X-ray diffraction patterns and evolutions of crystallite size for

samples prepared without and with PVP at different HS temperatures by 1 h.

phase formation (left) and PVP effect on crystallite sizes (right) of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles

CHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion

89

The addition of PVP does not change the crystalline phase formation; only CoFe2O4
phase was detected in X-ray diffraction patterns. The degree of crystallinity is similar

independently of the addition of PVP or of the PVP concentration (Figure 5.18). However

PVP influences the crystallite size but keeps the trend with the temperature variation. The

crystallite sizes in the samples with PVP are bigger than for the PVP-free sample at 100

°C. The crystallite size grows up to 150 °C in all samples and decrease afterwards with

the increase of temperature to 200 °C. PVP containing samples show a bigger decrease in

crystallite size when the temperature increases from 150 to 200 °C. The samples with

PVP present exactly the same slope in all temperature ranges. For HS temperatures above

of 150 °C, like observed in section 5.2.1 – Synthesis temperature effect, the crystallite

size decreases due to fast nucleation at high temperatures.

DTA/TGA measurements were carried out aiming to understand the PVP function

(capping agent or not) in hydrothermal synthesis of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles. In Figure 5.19

is presented DTA/TGA of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles prepared at 200 °C 1h without (left)

The first weight loss up to 150 °C was 2.5% for CFO nanoparticles prepared

without PVP and 1.8% for PVP10, which can be attributed to the evaporation of water

adsorption. From measurements of size of nanoparticles (Table 5.14), it is known that the

nanoparticles prepared in absence of PVP presented small size than those prepared with

PVP10, which means that the nanoparticles with small size have high capacity to adsorb

water molecules in their surface, leading to a higher weight loss in the temperature range

up to 150 °C when compared with PVP10. Furthermore, as the temperature increases the

weight loss between nanoparticles prepared without and with PVP10 tends to be equal,

which suggests that the PVP was not adsorbed on the surface of particles, thus not acting

as capping agent [115].

magnetization did not change effectively with PVP addition, suggesting that PVP is not

In order to study the effect of initial metal ions concentration, two concentrations

were used: 0.1/0.2 M and 0.3/0.6 M. Figure 5.21 shows CoFe2O4 prepared by different

concentrations of metal ions: 0.1/0.2 M and 0.3/0.6 M. The shape of nanoparticles does

not changed with varying metal ions concentrations. Both samples show quasi-spherical

The average particle size increases from 22.2 to 23.8 nm with increasing

concentration (Table 5.16). A possible explanation is the availability of ionic species on

the medium to promote the crystal growth.

5.3. Films functionalization

5.3.1. Electrophoretic deposition optimization

In order to achieve a good electrophoretic deposition is important to get a stable

suspension. The first step was to assess the stability of five different suspensions as a

function of the time. CoFe2O4 nanoparticles used for EPD were prepared at 230 °C and 1h

because, they present high crystallinity, good magnetic properties (73.2 emu/g) and small

particle size (16 mm), allowing it deposition in the pores of BaTiO3 thin films.

Figure 5.27 shows a qualitative study of the stability of the 5 suspensions prepared

in the same conditions based on the evaluation of the visual changes. The solvents on the

vials from left to right is water, ethanol, acetone, n-hexane and n-butanol. In the first 5

minutes, no changes were observed in the suspensions. After 30 minutes it could be seen

that the acetone suspension shows more sedimentation than the other ones. After 120

minutes, the water and n-butanol suspensions remain practically unchanged, while

ethanol and acetone are very clear indicating that the nanoparticles sediment in large

extend. In the water suspension after 1500 minutes is clear the start of a gradual

sedimentation. From all the solvents used as dispersant, n-hexane seems to be the one in

which, after the sedimentation of the large particles (occurring in the first 30 minutes), the

nanoparticles remain stable in suspension for longer times.

Figure 5.28 Transmittance (%) versus time (s) in order to observe the stability of different

suspensions.

As observed before, the acetone suspension shows the worst stability. The best ones

are water, n-hexane and n-butanol. The water suspension was not chosen because during

the EPD process, when a voltage is applied some bubbles appear due to the electrolysis of

water in presence of a voltage [120]. The chosen solvents for EPD optimization were n-

hexane and n-butanol. Table 5.20 presents the physical properties of these two solvents

important for EPD.

At the beginning of this project, the substrates used for deposition of BaTiO3 porous

matrices and EPD optimization were purchased from Inostek. These wafers are composed

with multilayer with known composition: Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si. The thicknesses of layers are

presented in Table 5.21.

The porous microstructure of the BaTiO3 films was the same in Inostek and

Ramtron substrates. However, for EPD optimization, during the deposition the peeling of

first layer of Inostek substrate (not shown) was observed. The peeling occurs in both n-

hexane and n-butanol suspensions. To further investigate what was occurring, other

common dispersants were tested such as acetone and ethanol (EtOH). Citric acid (CAc)

and triethanolamine (TEA) were added in order to change the suspension pH. Figure 5.29

shows the conditions used in terms of suspension composition, voltage and time (on the

left) and the visual aspect of the Inostek substrates after deposition (on the right).

Figure 5.29 EPD conditions (left) and visual aspect of the Inostek substrates after deposition

displaying the peeling after Pt layer.

In all cases, the Inostek substrate was not robust enough to be kept unchanged after

use. As the Ramtron substrate shows better performance under the described conditions,

the XRD patterns of both Inostek and Ramtron bare substrates were compared in an

attempt to understand the reasons of the different behaviour (Figure 5.30). The substrates

display similar XRD patterns, with the reflections peaks of SiO2, TiO2 and Pt. As the

layers of Ramtron substrate measured by SEM/EDS are very similar to the specifications

of the Inostek, one can conclude that the reasons for the peeling behaviour should be the

worse quality of this substrate in comparison to the Ramtron with a bad adhesion of the Pt

to the layers underneath. From now on, all experiments were performed on Ramtron

substrate.

To optimize the EPD depositions, different voltages (250 and 500 V) and different

deposition times (10, 30 and 60 s) were tested. A resume of the experiments with

different voltages and times is shown in Table 5.22:

The results of these experiments are presented in Figure 5.31 for n-hexane

suspension and Figure 5.32 for n-butanol suspension.

Figure 5.31 SEM micrographs of EPD optimization experiments for n-hexane suspension using

different voltages (250 and 500 V) and deposition times (10, 30 and 60 s).

For the same voltage, in n-hexane medium, the amount of deposited nanoparticles

increases with the deposition time. The use of 250 V allows a better control of the

deposition, as the difference between different times of deposition becomes clear. There

is not a big difference between the films prepared at 500 V for 10 or 30 s. For all the

conditions, the deposited nanoparticles seem to be agglomerated.

For n-butanol experiments, as it can be seen in Figure 5.32, the amount of deposited

nanoparticles is much lower than in the case of n-hexane suspension. This fact is related

to the dielectric constant of each solvent. As the dielectric constant of the n-butanol (17.5)

is quite high, a high ionic concentration is present at the solution, decreasing the mobility

of the species.

To functionalize the porous BaTiO3 matrices, it was used the n-hexane suspension,

250 V and 30 seconds of deposition time. The depositions were performed on the top of

C8 BaTiO3 film. C8 porous film was prepared using the PS-b-PEO with Mw of 58600-

71000 gmol-1. C8 presents ordered hexagonal arrangement of pores but pores sizes

averaging around 29 nm. As observed in Figure 5.33, after the deposition the

nanoparticles are still agglomerated. They are laying down at the top of the film. Almost

no particles go into the pores.

For further optimization of the electrophoretic mobility of species on n-butanol

suspensions a small amount of 0.6 mM iodine was added to the suspension. This time it

was chosen in order to functionalise the porous BaTiO3 thin film C1 as-prepared with the

block co-polymer with Mw of 40000-53000 gmol-1. Although the microstructure of C1 is

not so ordered as the one of C8, the pore size is larger (~61 nm) which may facilitate the

deposition. In Figure 5.34 is presented the functionalized C1 porous film, using a voltage

of 100 V and 1 minute of deposition time.

Figure 5.34 Functionalization with suspension n-butanol + iodine (0.6mM) 100V 60s.

It was observed that, effectively large and less ordered pores facilitate the

functionalization. A possible explanation for this behaviour can be besides the large pore,

which can accommodate easily one or more ferromagnetic particle, a better connectivity

with the conductive substrate. By adding 0.6 mM of iodine, the amount of deposited

nanoparticles was increased even with low voltage.

6. Conclusions	and	future	work

6.1. Ferroelectric thin films

Porous BaTiO3 films were successfully obtained by combining two methodologies:

evaporation induced self-assembly and dip-coating. The effect of type of annealing, Mw of

block copolymer and polymer concentration was observed. The annealing type (with or

without ramp) does not influence the microstructure of porous thin films. The copolymer with

higher molecular weight permits the pores organization and creates smaller pores. Further

studies need to be done to understand the formation of small pores using block co-polymer

with molecular weight (58600-71000). High concentrations of block co-polymer PS-b-PEO

lead to formation of interconnected pores due to high pore density. The thickness of porous

BaTiO3 thin films decreases with annealing temperature due to the crystallization of material.

The film thickness also depends on withdrawal speed since high speeds form thick films.

For a more complete study of ferroelectric porous thin films, a series of tasks and

further characterizations must be taken into consideration. Principally, a controlled correlation

between porosity magnitudes with the film thickness, will diminish topography deformation,

increase polarization and therefore induce topography – piezoresponse information

independence and allow a successful polarization hysteresis loop measurement. In addition,

an indispensable evidence for the piezoelectric character in materials is the switching of the

ferroelectric domains, by the application of DC bias voltage. Changing by positive to negative

voltage application direction, the domains are reoriented respectively. Last but not least, an

optimization of the combination between the technical characteristics of the cantilever tip

(geometry, spring constant, resonant frequency), the applied voltage amplitude and the

frequency is necessary for noise minimization.

These porous matrices are a good candidate for pyroelectric and multifunctional

applications due to porous microstructure.

The preparation of dense films in the same conditions as porous films (withdrawal

speed, molecular weight and concentration of co-polymer) are suggested in order to study the

effect of porosity on dielectric constant and ferroelectric properties. The effect of block co-

polymer concentration could affect the thickness of porous thin films, therefore studies on this

directions need to be done.



CHAPTER #6 | Conclusions and future work

108

6.2. Hydrothermal synthesis

The effect of various parameters on HS of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles was successfully

studied. For the temperature of HS effect, it can be concluded that the crystallite size increases

for temperatures between 100 and 150?C, but above this temperature, the particle size

decreases due to a fast nucleation and reduction of available precursors in solution avoiding

their growth. The magnetic properties increase with temperature of HS due to the high

crystallinity of samples synthesized at higher temperatures. At low HS temperature it was

verified a drop of the magnetization at 0 Oe field which indicates the presence of a soft

magnetic impurity. The samples prepared at 230°C 3h and 24h show the presence of hematite

phase which impairs the magnetic properties due to the presence of a antiferromagnetic phase,

hematite. The effect of PVP addition was studied. PVP addition does not influence the shape

of nanoparticles, however promotes the nanoparticles growth. The crystallite size increases

with the PVP addition, which did not acts as capping agent. The crystallinity and magnetic

properties were not affected by PVP addition. The concentration of Co2+/Fe3+ does not

influence the shape of nanoparticles. However, the crystallite size increases for higher

concentration due to the presence of more available precursors of crystal growth.

Nanoparticles prepared with high concentration of Co2+/Fe3+ show the higher saturation

magnetization measured at 10 K, 85.6 emu/g, and low coercive field (3195 Oe) meaning that

this material easily achieves saturation magnetization and easily this Ms could be withdrawn.

The concentration of NaOH influences the nanoparticles shape and size. For higher

concentrations nanoparticles show rhomb shape and the crystallite size is higher. The

nanoparticles prepared with low concentration of NaOH (6M) showed the presence of an

antiferromagnetic phase (hematite). However, it is in small weight and did not influence the

magnetic properties.

Studies of effect of PVP for longer times of hydrothermal synthesis would be interesting

to be done.  A heating rate during the hydrothermal synthesis could avoid the rapid nucleation

of nanoparticles, reducing their sizes. Lower concentrations than 6 M of NaOH should be

used in hydrothermal synthesis in order to understand the formation of hematite phase.



CHAPTER #6 | Conclusions and Future Work

109

6.3. Functionalization by EPD

The effect of stability of different suspensions for EPD was observed. Voltage and time

of deposition effects were studied in order to optimize the electrophoretic deposition of

CoFe2O4 nanoparticles.

The chemical and physical stability of substrates is a very important key to take into

account.

EPD is a good candidate to functionalize porous BaTiO3 thin films however, the

deposition of nanoparticles does not occur in the pores of BaTiO3 thin films as desired due to

an agglomeration of nanoparticles. More studies need to be done in order to disperse CoFe2O4
nanoparticles and get a successful EPD.

7. Final	notes

This thesis allowed to get significant knowledge about ferroelectric, ferromagnetic and

multiferroic materials, which was not acquired during the Master in Engineering Materials

curricular activities. New methods for synthesis of thin films and magnetic nanoparticles were

learned. The properties of final products could be easily manipulated by changing some

process parameters.
