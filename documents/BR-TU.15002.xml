GREENHOUSE GAS BALANCE ASSOCIATED WITH SUGARCANE 
PRODUCTION IN SOUTH-CENTRAL BRAZIL, CONSIDERING THE 

MANAGEMENT AND EXPANSION 
 

 

ABSTRACT – The substitution of fossil fuel with sugarcane ethanol aiming to reduce 
emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) has recently been debated because of the 
possible emissions incurred from land use change (LUC). This work was based on 
GHG inventory from cultivation and LUC of recently established sugarcane plantation 
in south-central Brazil, with the purpose of estimating the impact of expansion on GHG 
balance, including emissions and removals due to LUC. Changes in quantity and 
quality of soil carbon (C) upon conversion of diverse agricultural systems (coffee, 
citrus, annual crops and pasture) to sugarcane in southern Brazil were also assessed 
through field experiments. The estimates show that sugarcane cultivation and its 
expansion during 2006-2011 in south-central Brazil presented an overall accumulated 
GHG balance of 217.1 Tg CO2eq by 2030, including emissions from cultivation 
activities and emissions/removals due to LUC. Expansion of sugarcane plantation 
contributed to attenuate part of GHG emissions from agricultural production phase. 
Similarly, the ethanol C offset by displacing fossil fuels could readily payback that C 
deficit. The data obtained by field experiments show that the LUC of coffee and citrus 
to sugarcane depleted soil C stock by 21.5% (26.8 Mg C ha-1) and 23.6% (34.9 Mg C 
ha-1) in the 0-100 cm layer after a period of 3 and 4 years, respectively. In contrast, 
there was no significant difference in soil C stocks in 0-100 cm depth upon conversion 
of pasture and annual crop into sugarcane. However, only the conversion of pasture 
into sugarcane decreased soil C stock in 0-20 cm depth, with depletion of 13.3 Mg C 
ha-1 (43.9%) over 8 years after the LUC. With regard to the quality of soil C, the data 
of Laser-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy (LIFS) showed that the higher the losses 
of soil C, the greater was the humification index (HLIFS) of soil organic matter (SOM). 
In general, conversion of the agrosystems (e.g., coffee, citrus, annual crop and 
pasture) into sugarcane increased HLIFS of SOM. For some depths, HLIFS more than 
doubled in comparison with the previous land uses. We expect that the results 
achieved in this work may contribute to the development of actions and public policies 
to strengthen strategies for GHG mitigation and ensure the environmental benefits of 
sugarcane ethanol in Brazil. 
 

Keywords: ethanol production, inventory, land use change, mitigation, sugarcane 
management, climate change

BALANÇO DE GASES DE EFEITO ESTUFA ASSOCIADO À PRODUÇÃO DE 
CANA-DE-AÇÚCAR NO CENTRO-SUL DO BRASIL, CONSIDERANDO-SE O 

MANEJO E A EXPANSÃO 
 

 

RESUMO – A substituição dos combustíveis fósseis pelo etanol de cana-de-açúcar 
visando à redução das emissões de gases de efeito estufa (GEE) tem sido 
recentemente questionada devido às possíveis emissões decorrentes da mudança do 
uso da terra (MUT). Este trabalho se baseou no inventário de GEE do cultivo e da 
MUT associada à expansão da cana-de-açúcar no centro-sul do Brasil, com a 
finalidade de estimar o impacto dessa expansão no balanço de GEE, incluindo as 
emissões e remoções devido à MUT. Objetivou-se também, por meio de experimento 
de campo, avaliar as mudanças na quantidade e qualidade do carbono (C) do solo 
após a conversão de diferentes agrossistemas (café, citros, cultura anual e pastagem) 
para cana-de-açúcar no sudeste do Brasil. As estimativas apontam que o cultivo da 
cana-de-açúcar e sua expansão durante 2006-2011 no centro-sul do Brasil resultaram 
no balanço acumulado total de GEE de 217,1 Tg CO2eq em 2030, incluindo as 
emissões das atividades de cultivo e as emissões/remoções associadas à MUT. As 
estimativas indicam que a expansão dos canaviais contribuiu para atenuar parte das 
emissões de GEE da fase de produção agrícola. Do mesmo modo, o uso de etanol 
em substituição aos combustíveis fósseis poderia facilmente compensar esse déficit 
de C. Os resultados das avaliações de campo apontam que a conversão de café para 
cana-de-açúcar resultou na depleção dos estoques de C do solo de 21,5% (26.8 Mg 
C ha-1) e 23,6% (34.9 Mg C ha-1) na camada de 0-100 cm ao longo dos períodos de 3 
e 4 anos após a MUT, respectivamente. As conversões de pastagem e cultura anual 
para cana-de-açúcar não apresentaram diferenças significativas na camada de 0-100 
cm. Entretanto, apenas a transição de pastagem para cana apresentou diferenças 
significativas na camada de 0-20 cm, resultando na depleção dos estoques de C do 
solo de 43,9% (13.3 Mg C ha-1) durante 8 anos após a conversão. Com relação à 
qualidade do C do solo, a técnica de espectroscopia de fluorescência induzida por 
laser mostrou que quanto maior a perda de C no solo devido à MUT para cana, maior 
o índice de humificação (HFIL) da matéria orgânica do solo (MOS). Em geral, a 
conversão dos agrossistemas (café, citros, cultura anual e pastagem) para cana-de-
açúcar promoveu o aumento do HFIL da MOS. Em algumas profundidades, o HFIL mais 
do que dobrou em relação aos usos anteriores. Espera-se que os resultados gerados 
neste trabalho contribuam para o desenvolvimento de ações e políticas públicas 
visando fortalecer estratégias que possam potencializar ainda mais a mitigação de 
GEE, e garantir os benefícios ambientais do etanol de cana-de-açúcar no Brasil. 
 

Palavras-chave: produção de etanol, inventário, mudança do uso da terra, mitigação, 
manejo da cana-de-açúcar, mudanças climáticas.

CHAPTER 1 – GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 

 

1.1 Introduction and Justification 

 

1.1.1 On the agriculture and climate change 

 

Economic and population growth have driven a large strain for land and other 

natural resources to produce food, fiber and energy (TILMAN et al., 2009). The 

atmospheric concentration of the greenhouse gases (GHG) has increased since 1750, 

mostly due to human activity. In 2011, the concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), 

methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were 391 ppm, 1803 ppb, and 324 ppb, and 

exceeded the pre-industrial levels by about 40%, 150%, and 20%, respectively (IPCC, 

2013). 

The additional greenhouse effect has been largely driven by the burning of 

fossil fuels since the mid-20th century. Likewise, agriculture directly contributes with 

14% of global anthropogenic GHG emissions and accounts for an additional emission 

of 17% when the conversion of land-use to agricultural production is taken into account 

(LYBBERT; SUMNER, 2012). The increased concentration of anthropogenic 

greenhouse gas (GHG) is reported as a causal link between external drivers of climate 

change and observed changes in climatic variables (e.g., precipitation intensity, 

cyclones, floods and droughts; IPCC, 2013). 

Beyond of its contribution to climate change, agriculture is also affected by 

those impacts, with projections of additional risks for food security in the near future 

(SCHMIDHUBER; TUBIELLO, 2007). The effects of climate change on tropical 

agriculture could lead to decreased productivity and quality of agricultural goods, 

changes in crop management and reduction of areas suitable for agricultural 

production, with social, economic and political consequences (CERRI et al., 2007a). 

Unfavorable climatic conditions over the last few years are among several other 

aspects that have affected sugarcane plantations (Saccharum officinarum) with regard 

to productivity declines in different regions of Brazil (CONAB, 2014), dropping from 

115 ton ha-1 in 2008 to 69 ton ha-1 in 2012 (ANGELO, 2012). Simulations presented 

by ASSAD et al. (2004) indicate that the increased temperature over the next years 



2 

can result in a reduction of areas suitable for agricultural production in Brazil on more 

than 95% in the states of Goiás, Minas Gerais and São Paulo, and about 75% in 

Paraná. 

Unlike the developed countries, climate change issues in Brazil are mostly 

related to land use and land-use change (LUC) as approximately 80% of the national 

GHG emissions in 2005 were sourced from agriculture and LUC sectors (MCT, 2010). 

However, public policies and interventions in beef and soy supply chains have already 

contributed for the recent 70% decline in deforestation in the Brazilian Amazonia, and 

this target may reach to a 90% reduction in 2018 (NEPSTAD et al., 2014). Even 

holding the largest potential for agricultural expansion in the coming years, Brazil has 

achieved impressive results in reducing GHG emissions by 40% since 2005 through 

the reduction of deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazonia (LAPOLA et al., 2013). 

The characterization of how the changes on the soil use and management 

affects the dynamics of GHG emissions over time is something of great importance, 

especially in tropical regions, to determine the impact of LUC on global climate. Soils 

account for around 1,550 Pg of organic carbon (C), more than twice the amount of C 

present in the atmosphere (720 Pg) and about three times more than the C of the 

terrestrial biota (LAL, 2001; FOLLETT, 2001). 

Greenhouse gas fluxes in agriculture are complex and heterogeneous, but 

management practices in agricultural systems could offer mitigation opportunities. 

Moreover, practices that reduce the GHG emission at the same time they enhanced 

the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems to climate change. This would increase 

agricultural yields and lead to increased food security (HARVEY et al., 2014). 

The global technical potential for mitigation options in agriculture by 2030, 

considering all gases, was estimated to be ~5500-6000 MtCO2-eq year-1 (SMITH et 

al., 2008). Of the technical potential ("high agreement, much evidence") estimated by 

SMITH et al. (2008), about 89% is from restoring soil carbon (soil C sequestration), 

about 9% from mitigation of CH4 and about 2% from mitigation of soil N2O emissions. 

Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of 

GHG emissions. Some options to mitigate climate change in agricultural areas include: 

improved management of agricultural lands; improved pasture management, 

restoration of cultivated organic soils; recovery of degraded lands, management of 



3 

livestock, manure/biosolid management and bioenergy production (IPCC, 2007). 

SMITH et al. (2008) estimated a global potential mitigation of 770 MtCO2-eq year-1 by 

2030 from improved energy efficiency in agriculture (e.g., through reduced fossil fuel 

use). 

As soil is the compartment where C is more concentrated in the terrestrial 

environment, and it is prone to LUC (CERRI et al., 2007b; MAIA et al., 2010), global 

initiatives have arisen aiming to investigate the effects of LUC and its results in terms 

of GHG balance, considering emissions and sequestration (MILNE et al., 2007). 

Moreover, changes in management practices in the sugarcane cultivation have been 

considered as important as to the current expansion of the agricultural frontier (CERRI 

et al., 2007b), since large areas are being converted from a burned harvest regime to 

a non-burned green mechanized harvest in south-central Brazil. 

 

1.1.2 Inventory of greenhouse gas emissions in agricultural areas 

 

Awareness of environmental issues in the medium and long term is essential 

for sustainable development. It is necessary to develop a set of strategies that include 

adaptation, mitigation, and new researches to mitigate climate change. The United 

Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the main 

multilateral forum focused on addressing climate change. Guided by the uncertainties 

of the future and a strong concern on global climate, a common and differentiated 

commitment has been established among all members, such as the reduction and 

stabilization of GHG concentrations in order to ensure the food security and economic 

development by limiting warming over the 21st century to below 2°C relative to pre-

industrial levels. 

In the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) recently published 

by Brazilian government, and submitted to the UNFCCC under the Conference of the 

Parties in Paris (COP21), Brazil has pledged to reduce GHG emissions by 43% below 

2005 levels in 2030 and adopt further measures with a 2°C-increase temperature goal, 

in particular to restore and reforest 12 million hectares of forest by 2030 and 

strengthen policies and measures to achieve zero illegal deforestation by 2030 in the 

Brazilian Amazonia (UNFCCC, 2015). 



4 

Government requirements for mitigation and adaptation to climate change 

resulted in methodologies as the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas 

Inventories (IPCC, 2006). This is an important tool for estimating national inventories 

of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of GHG, assisting 

parties in fulfilling their commitments under the UNFCCC. Such methodology is also 

important for quantifying and analyzing the potential impacts in terms of GHG balance 

associated with agricultural production, aiming to guide the formulation of public 

policies. 

The determination of the potential GHG mitigation and the effective substitution 

of fossil fuels using sugarcane ethanol should be supported by studies of 

environmental impacts, particularly by methodologies aimed at analyzing the GHG 

balance and consumption of fossil energy in different production systems. Studies of 

GHG inventories are adequate in this context as they allow a comprehensive analysis 

of the entire production chain. 

The quantification of GHG emission from sugarcane ethanol has been triggered 

by the need of new studies in the scientific community. Several have demonstrated 

the strategic advantages of sugarcane ethanol for mitigating GHG compared to other 

bioenergy crops in substitution of fossil fuels (NGUYEN et al., 2007; RENOUF et al., 

2008; BÖRJESSON, 2009; GOLDEMBERG; GUARDABASSI, 2010). However, the 

rapid changes in both industrial and agricultural sectors continue to raise debate and 

require further analysis and discussion. 

For instance, legal restrictions regarding the sugarcane pre-harvest burning, 

and the consequent increase of mechanical harvesting without burning could influence 

the GHG balance in agricultural areas in various forms, since the quantities of diesel 

and agricultural inputs (nitrogen fertilizer, vinasse, filter cake, limestone and pesticide) 

consumed in the crop production vary according to the management system adopted, 

namely with or without the burning practice. 

BORDONAL et al. (2012) reported that the conversion from a burnt to an 

unburnt sugarcane harvesting system, including the adoption of recommended 

management practices (e.g., reduced soil tillage and crop rotation with N-fixing crops 

during sugarcane field renovation), could save from 1223.6 to 1587.3 kg CO2eq ha-1 

year-1. In São Paulo state, GHG emissions from harvesting operations in sugarcane 



5 

fields have decreased by approximately 37.6% over the last 20 years, from 1.015 ton 

CO2eq ha-1 in 1990 to 0.633 ton CO2eq ha-1 in 2009 (CAPAZ et al., 2013). Government 

actions are already becoming effective for reducing sugarcane straw burning 

(FRANÇA et al., 2014). 

 

1.1.3 Sugarcane ethanol and the potential for greenhouse gas mitigation 

 

Increases in energy supply from solar, wind, hydraulic and bioenergy sources 

have been enhanced by the growing concern on GHG emissions from fossil fuels, 

depletion of petroleum reserves, and risks of climate change and extreme events 

(LAL, 2014). Biofuels are one of the few technologies that may result in negative 

GHGs emissions through replacement of fossil fuels, and a reduction of up 85% has 

been reported for sugarcane-based ethanol (BÖRJESSON, 2009). In addition, they 

are widely propounded by presenting potential benefits such as restoring degraded 

soils, increasing both C budgets in soil and biomass, and also cooling the local climate 

(LOARIE et al., 2011; LAL, 2014). 

Brazil already has one of the largest and most successful biofuel programs to 

date, including cogeneration of electricity using biomass. The sugarcane production 

is mostly concentrated in the south-central region of Brazil, accounting for about 90% 

of the total cultivated area in 2015. São Paulo is the state with the largest expansion 

of sugarcane plantation during the last years, holding around 60% of the cultivated 

area in south-central Brazil (UNICA, 2015). 

The Brazilian Alcohol Program (Proálcool) was launched in 1975 aiming to 

reduce the reliance on oil imports through production of sugarcane-based ethanol, 

and the environmental benefits were soon recognized by presenting an avoided 

emission of 27.5 Tg CO2equivalent in 2003 due to substitution of gasoline use in Brazil 

(MACEDO, 2005). On a global scale, Brazil is the second largest producer of ethanol 

and represents nearly 33% of the worldwide production, which could play an important 

role in supplying future ethanol needs (CERQUEIRA LEITE et al., 2009). 

Several food crops are used for biofuels production, including grains (maize, 

sorghum and wheat), sugar crops (sugarcane, sugar beet), starch crops (cassava), 

and oilseed crops (soybean and oil palm). Nevertheless, the GHG savings achieved 



6 

by biofuels are strongly reliant on the feedstock alternative considered and the 

management practices associated to its agricultural production (DAVIS et al., 2013). 

Recent analysis of the energy balance and GHGs emissions from alternative options 

of biofuels started a major controversy and discussions about the true outcomes 

related to its sustainability (MACEDO et al., 2008; RENOUF et al., 2008; SEABRA et 

al., 2011; TSAO et al., 2011; DUNN et al., 2013). 

Certain basic issues on the expansion of biofuels remain under debate 

worldwide, especially regarding the land requirements to supply the future demand of 

ethanol (LEAL et al., 2013). Ethanol production from corn and sugarcane is expected 

to increase from 80 to approximately 200 billion liters in 2021 (GOLDEMBERG et al., 

2014). In order to achieve this target in an environmentally sound manner, several 

aspects regarding the production of sugarcane ethanol must be assessed, i.e., land 

use change (FARGIONE et al., 2008; LAPOLA et al., 2010; MELLO et al., 2014), air 

quality (TSAO et al., 2011), GHG balance associated with sugarcane cultivation 

(BORDONAL et al., 2012), farm inputs (LAL, 2004) and, the energy balance and C 

footprint (LAL, 2014). 

There is a growing need for all productive sectors to develop GHG mitigation 

techniques to combat global warming. Inventorying the potential for GHG mitigation in 

sugarcane fields in southern Brazil, BORDONAL et al. (2013) estimated that changes 

in management practices during the sugarcane cultivation, such as the conversion of 

harvest system from a burnt to an unburnt regime and the reduced soil tillage in 

addition to the introduction of an N-fixing crop during crop renovation, if adopted, could 

result in GHG mitigation potentials ranging from 50.5 to 70.9 Mt CO2eq over the period 

from 2012 to 2050 (Figure 1). Therefore, the adoption of management practices that 

lead to a reduction of GHG emissions in sugarcane areas could contribute 

considerably to achieving the objectives set by Brazilian government to curb 

emissions, in addition to promoting sustainable production of sugar and ethanol in 

Brazil.

However, concerns regarding the extent to what the expansion of sugarcane 

plantation have caused deforestation and/or displacement of food crops arise 

questions about its sustainability (NGUYEN et al., 2010; WALTER et al., 2011). 

Energy crops have expanded significantly in Brazil. Between 2005 and 2010 about 4 

million hectares of sugarcane were incorporated into the existing cultivated areas in 

south-central Brazil (ADAMI et al., 2012), totaling 9.6 million hectares cultivated in 

2015 (UNICA, 2015). Such expansion has turned the sugarcane as the main source 

of renewable energy in Brazil, accounting for 15.7% of the domestic energy supply in 

2014 (BRASIL, 2015). 

The LUC due to agricultural expansion can result in GHG emissions, mainly 

CO2. Such emissions derive from the burning of native vegetation, decomposition of 

plant material and oxidation of soil organic matter (CERRI et al., 2007b; FEARNSIDE 

et al., 2009). This is due to the change of organic material input in the production 



8 

system, and can be altered in a negative way, with a reduction of carbon stocks, or 

positively, with an increase of carbon stocks (MAIA et al., 2010). 

GHGs emissions from LUC may be significant depending on how biofuels are 

produced (SEARCHINGER et al., 2008), so that the carbon savings from sugarcane 

ethanol could be negated by any pressure of the production expansion over native 

forests or grasslands (LAPOLA et al., 2010). The soil C debt associated with the 

conversion from native vegetation and pastoral lands to sugarcane plantation has a 

payback time of 8 and 2-3 years, respectively (MELLO et al., 2014). Additionally, 

FARGIONE et al. (2008) reported that the conversion from Cerrado wooded to 

sugarcane plantation in Brazil releases ~165 Mg CO2 ha-1 over 50 years and requires 

17 years to repay the "carbon debt". 

Conversely, the replacement of marginal or degraded lands by sugarcane 

plantation can offset some anthropogenic emissions by recycling atmospheric CO2 

(LAL, 2014). Sugarcane plantation has a potential to store from 15.9 to 29.2 Mg C    

ha-1 yr-1 into biomass (BEEHARRY, 2001; RONQUIM, 2007), and the replacement of 

ecosystems with the lowest C stocks (e.g., degraded grasslands) by energy crops with 

higher yields (e.g., sugarcane and oil palm), may reduce or even eliminate the 

payback time of the C debt incurred from LUC (GIBBS et al., 2008). 

The magnitude of changes in both C reservoirs (e.g., biomass and soil) 

following LUC can directly affect the GHG balance associated with sugarcane 

cultivation and is relevant for assessing the C savings from sugarcane ethanol use in 

substitution of fossil fuels. Remote sensing satellite images are an effective tool in 

monitoring the management and expansion of sugarcane plantation (RUDORFF et 

al., 2010; AGUIAR et al., 2011; ADAMI et al., 2012), allowing the generation of 

accurate information that can serve as a basis for studies on GHG balance. 

Since 2006, the National Institute for Space Research (Instituto Nacional de 

Pesquisas Espaciais; INPE) monitors the direct land use change (dLUC) associated 

with sugarcane expansion and delineates areas under sugarcane cultivated with 

specific management and harvest practices (e.g., manual harvest with prior burning 

vs. green mechanized harvest without burning) in south-central Brazil. 

In this context, there are consolidated methodologies to assess the impact of 

dLUC and sugarcane cultivation in terms of GHG balance, as proposed by the 



9 

"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - IPCC (2006)". This methodology 

entitled "IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories" allows 

determining GHG emissions from agricultural production, and losses or gains of C 

stocks in biomass (above- and below-ground) and soil following the dLUC. 

 

1.2 General goals 

 

The objectives of this work were: (i) to estimate the greenhouse gas balance 

from cultivation and direct land use change of recently expanded sugarcane plantation 

in south-central Brazil (Chapter 2); and (ii) to assess the changes in quantity and 

quality of soil carbon due to the main land-use conversions to sugarcane plantation in 

southern Brazil (Chapter 3).
