Abstract 

Peruvian coastal waters are influenced by strong coastal upwelling events and an intense 

oxygen minimum zone, where large amounts of fixed nitrogen can be lost. In order to 

investigate some of the effects this oxygen minimum zone may have on these coastal 

waters, this study aimed to evaluate the influence of dissolved inorganic macronutrient 

concentration and ratio on the elemental stoichiometry of sinking particulate matter and 

carbon export. At the beginning of February 2017, eight mesocosms were deployed in 

coastal waters near Lima, Peru. 4 mesocosms were enriched with an OMZ derived water 

mass with a dissolved inorganic N:P ratio of 0.11, while the other 4 were enriched with OMZ 

water of N:P = 1.71. The amount of utilized reactive nitrogen was not associated to 

differences in carbon export rates, but the results of one individual mesocosm hint at 

stronger carbon export at low primary production. Furthermore, sinking particulate matter 

and its elemental stoichiometry did not show differences between treatments. However, 

our results showed clear deviations from the canonical Redfield ratio in sinking POM, 

hypothesized to be related with phytoplankton community composition.

Resumo 

Os nutrientes inorgânicos dissolvidos são fundamentais para o funcionamento das redes 

alimentares marinhas e são, direta ou indiretamente, absorvidos por todos os organismos 

vivos. As regiões de afloramento costeiro apresentam elevada concentração de nutrientes 

inorgânicos, constituindo ecossistemas marinhos muito produtivos a nível biológico. Embora 

representam apenas 1% da área superficial do oceano global, as áreas de afloramento 

costeiro são responsáveis, em média,por cerca de 11% da produção primária anual nova. A 

variabilidade climática prevista, associada à crescente da pressão antrópica na atmosfera e 

no oceano, foi associada à intensificação e expansão da área ocupada pelas zonas mínimas 

de oxigénio (Oxygen Minimum Zones, OMZ), geralmente associadas aos sistemas de 

afloramento costeiro. Neste contexto, torna-se necessário avaliar e compreender as 

consequências do aumento das OMZ sobre os  ciclos biogeoquímicos de nutrientes, de 

forma a prever com rigor a variabilidade futura do ambiente marinho e aplicar estratégias 

de gestão adequadas. 

Os eventos de afloramento costeiro ao largo da costa do Peru, bem como em outros 

sistemas similares, estão geralmente associados ao transporte de massas de água sub-

superficiais, com elevada concentrações de nutrientes inorgânicos dissolvidos. Porém, a 

concentração de nutrientes inorgânicos dissolvidos e as proporções entre as formas 

contendo azoto e fósforo (ratio N:P) variam em função da intensidade dos eventos de 

afloramento e dos processos que influenciam a concentração e composição dos nutrientes 

em níveis inferiores à superfície. O azoto inorgânico é um elemento essencial ao 

crescimento do fitoplâncton e, muitas vezes, limita a produtividade primária, 

desempenhando assim um papel crucial na biogeoquímica marinha. As formas de azoto 



IX 
 

inorgânico biodisponíveis incluem o nitrato, nitrito e amónia, mas constituem apenas cerca 

de 6% da concentração total de azoto disponível na água do mar.  

O fósforo inorgânico é igualmente um elemento essencial ao crescimento do fitoplâncton, 

sendo a principal forma biodisponível o fosfato. Representa uma parte integrante da 

estrutura celular (ex.: ácidos nucleicos, incluindo DNA e RNA) e dos compostos associados 

ao armazenamento de energia química nas células, nomeadamente da molécula adenosina 

trifosfato (ATP). Assim, a análise do ciclo biogeoquimico do fósforo é relevante para 

determinar a estrutura e função dos ecossistemas.  

A exportação vertical de matéria orgânica a partir da superfície do oceano representa um 

processo chave para o funcionamento da bomba biológica de carbono, um componente 

importante do ciclo global do carbono. O carbono inorgânico é absorvido sob a forma de 

CO2 pelo fitoplâncton, transformado e acumulado no interior das células sob a forma de 

carbono orgânico, através da fotossíntese, e transportado verticalmente para o oceano 

profundo. Assim, o fluxo vertical de células fitoplanctónicas, em estado fisiológico variável, 

controla fortemente a capacidade do oceano como um coletor e reservatório de CO2. A 

exportação vertical de material particulado é determinada pela taxa de decomposição e 

velocidade de afundamento do material em afundamento, bem como pela migração vertical 

diária do zooplâncton ativo. O material particulado em afundamento no oceano é composto 

por agregados orgânicos, geralmente designados neve marinha, pelotas fecais do 

zooplâncton e fitodetritos. As partículas com reduzida velocidade de afundamento são 

geralmente consumidas ou degradadas antes de atingir o oceano profundo. Pelo contrário, 

as partículas com elevada velocidade de afundamento apresentam maior probabilidade de 

atingir o sedimento. A eficiência da bomba biológica depende ainda da composição da 



X 
 

comunidade fitoplanctónica e, em consequência, das condições abióticas do ambiente 

marinho, incluindo a concentração e composição dos nutrientes inorgânicos dissolvidos. 

O presente estudo pretende avaliar a influência da concentração e composição (ratio) dos 

macronutrientes inorgânicos dissolvidos na água aflorada sobre a estequiometria da 

matéria em suspensão na plataforma continental do Peru. Os objetivos específicos do 

estudo abordaram as seguintes questões: (1) Estarão massas de água afloradas com 

diferente concentração e composição de nutrientes (ratio N:P) associadas a diferenças na 

estequiometria elementar das partículas em suspensão e sedimentação?; (2) Estarão a 

concentração e a taxa de absorção de nutrientes relacionadas com diferenças nas taxas de 

exportação do carbono orgânico? 

O presente estudo integrou-se no Collaborative Research Center (SFB 754) “Climate-

Biogeochemistry Interactions in the  Tropical Ocean” e baseou-se numa experiência iniciada 

em fevereiro de 2017, com recurso à plataforma Kiel Off-Shore Mesocosms for Ocean 

Simulations (KOSMOS), uma instalação móvel de mesocosmos, aplicável em  experiências 

em larga escala, in situ. Os mesocosmos são unidades experimentais com um volume 

elevado, apropriadas para simular eventos de afloramento, em condições controladas quasi 

naturais, uma vez que permitem a manipulação eficiente das variáveis ambientais, incluindo 

a concentração de nutrientes. De forma a atingir os objetivos propostos, foram utilizados 

dois tratamentos experimentais, com quatro replicados cada (2 * 4 = 8 mesocosmos): massa 

de água com ratio N:P reduzido e massa de água com ratio N:P muito reduzido, a nível da 

composição de nutrientes inorgânicos dissolvidos. No início de fevereiro de 2017, foram 

implantados oito mesocosmos em águas costeiras ao largo de Lima (Peru), contendo 

armadilhas de sedimento no interior. A experiência decorreu durante um período de 50 

dias, entre fevereiro e abril de 2017. Quatro mesocosmos foram enriquecidos com uma 



XI 
 

massa de água amostrada na OMZ, com um ratio N: P de 0,11, enquanto os restantes quatro 

mesocosmos foram enriquecidos com uma massa de água amostrada na OMZ  com um ratio 

N: P de 1,71. Em cada um dos oito mesocosmos foram analisadas a concentração de nitritos, 

nitratos, amónia, fosfatos, silicatos, bem como os ratio associados, e clorofila-a (indicador 

da biomassa total do fitoplâncton) na coluna de água. Adicionalmente, foi amostrada a 

matéria particulada acumulada no interior de armadilhas de sedimento. Neste caso foram 

analisadas a concentração de carbono total, azoto total, carbono orgânico particulado, 

azoto orgânico particulado, carbono inorgânico particulado, sílica orgânica particulada e 

sílica biogênica. As diferenças entre os dois tratamentos experimentais, para todas as 

variáveis referidas, foram testadas estatisticamente. 

Os resultados obtidos não revelaram diferenças significativas em nenhuma das variáveis 

químicas ou biológicas entre os dois tratamentos experimentais. No entanto, observaram-se 

desvios claros nos ratios C: N: P, em relação aos valores propostos por Redfield (106: 16: 1), 

para os nutrientes inorgânicos dissolvidos e matéria orgânica particulada acumulada nas 

armadilhas de sedimento. Hipóteses para explicar estes desvios foram apresentadas, 

incluindo variações na composição da comunidade de fitoplâncton e mixotrofia. Os 

resultados indicaram que a concentração de azoto utilizado não se associou a diferenças 

significativas nas taxas de exportação vertical de carbono. No geral, a estratégia 

experimental utilizada apresentou alguns problemas incluindo uma similaridade entre as 

duas massas de água amostradas na OMZ e os distúrbios gerados pelas aves marinhas (ex.: 

entrada de guano e presas no interior dos mesocosmos). Experiências futuras deverão 

ativamente limitar estes problemas.  A informação quantitativa sobre a composição da 

comunidade fitoplanctónica, disponível futuramente (após a data de submissão desta tese 

de mestrado), deverá ser utilizada para testar as hipóteses apresentadas no estudo.

1. Introduction 

1.1 Coastal upwelling ecosystems and Oxygen Minimum Zones 

The eastern boundaries of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are characterized by major coastal 

upwelling systems. Prevailing alongshore equatorward wind stress, in combination with 

Coriolis deflection due to earth´s rotation, forces surface water to be driven offshore, which 

in turn is replaced by cool, nutrient-rich subsurface upwelled water (Bakun, 1990; Caddy 

and Bakun, 1994). These coastal upwelling areas therefore supply essential dissolved 

inorganic nutrients and stimulate phytoplankton primary production, which forms the base 

of productive food webs, including valuable fishery resources (Bakun, 1990). Coastal 

upwelling regions cover only a small fraction (1%) of the global ocean, but contribute 

disproportionally to oceanic productivity, therefore playing an important role in the 

biogeochemical cycling of marine nutrients (Capone and Hutchins, 2013; Hauss, Franz and 

Sommer, 2012). The Peru current system, flowing northwards off the South American West 

coast, is unequaled among all other upwelling systems in terms of fish biomass and fishery 

landings (Bakun and Weeks, 2008). Biogeochemically, it is also of great importance due to 

its intense Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ), with a thickness over 600m at some points 

(Daneri et al., 2000; Fuenzalida et al., 2009). OMZs are permanently oxygen deficient waters 

that develop at mid-depths, below surface waters, as a result of poor ventilation, high 

surface primary production and resultant organic matter vertical exportation which is 

decomposed by microbial activity, ultimately consuming oxygen (Fuenzalida et al., 2009; 

Kalvelage et al., 2013). As anthropogenic disturbances continue to support global warming 

and oceanic nutrient input, further decreasing oxygen concentrations in the ocean, OMZs 

are predicted to increase both in spatial coverage and intensity (Fuenzalida et al., 2009). 



2 
 

Even though OMZs with oxygen concentrations less than 20 ?mol kg
-1

 occupy only 1% of the 

global ocean volume, they account for ~20-40% of global oceanic nitrogen loss (Glock et al., 

2013; Lam and Kuypers, 2011).  

1.2 Nitrogen cycling in Oxygen Minimum Zones 

Inorganic nitrogen is essential for phytoplankton growth and often limits marine primary 

productivity, therefore playing a crucial role within marine biogeochemistry (Bohlen et al., 

2011; Glock et al., 2013). Bioavailable forms of inorganic nitrogen include nitrate (NO3
-
), 

nitrite (NO2
-
) and ammonium (NH4

+
), but constitute only 6% of total nitrogen available in 

seawater (Bohlen et al., 2011; Gier et al., 2016). A generalization of the marine nitrogen 

cycle is depicted in Figure 1.1.  

Under oxic conditions (&gt;90 ?mol O2 kg
-1

), present in most parts of the global ocean, oxygen 

is the most energetically favourable electron acceptor for the decomposition of organic 

matter (Lam and Kuypers, 2011; Kristensen, 2000). However, in oxygen depleted waters,  

nitrate is the next preferred electron acceptor and used as an oxidant in the degradation of 

sinking organic matter, yielding similar amounts of free energy in relation to  oxic microbial 

respiration (Lachkar et al., 2016; Lam and Kuypers, 2011). This dissimilatory reduction of 

nitrate in anaerobic respiration converts nitrate, with intermediate products, to dinitrogen 

gas (N2), thus resulting in a lower N:P nutrient ratio and therefore a deficit of nitrate relative 

to phosphate (Fuenzalida et al., 2009). Increasing denitrification rates, the complete 

reduction of nitrate to N2, due to decreasing oxygen concentrations, lead to a lower 

nitrogen inventory in the ocean, thus negatively affecting marine productivity. Moreover, 

denitrification is positively linked to nitrous oxide (N2O) production and release to the 



3 
 

atmosphere. This in turn will result in higher atmospheric CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O) levels, 

further supporting the greenhouse effect (Gruber, 2008). 

Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), based on NO2
-
 as final electron accepter, is 

another biological process associated to N2 gas production. Anammox is carried out by 

chemo-autotrophic bacteria, meaning that the reaction is used as an energy source. In 

contrast to denitrification, anammox is associated to the emission of N2 without the 

production of intermediate, powerful greenhouse gases (e.g., N2O).  More and more 

attention is being attributed to this relatively recently discovered process in the marine 

environment, as its quantitative significance for the marine nitrogen cycle is not fully known 

yet (Brandes et al., 2007; Gruber, 2008). At least one study (Kuypers et al., 2005) has 

suggested that anammox, instead of denitrification, is primarily responsible for the 

biological loss of fixed nitrogen in the OMZ of the Benguela upwelling system. However, it is 

important to keep in mind that processes supplying the reactants for annamox (or other 

reactions in general) may differ in intensity across different environments. Therefore, the 

contribution of anammox to the loss of fixed nitrogen in the Peru upwelling system might be 

very variable (Brandes et al., 2007; Gruber, 2008).   

Heterotrophic denitrification and anammox are the two dominant pathways through which 

atmospheric N2 is released and reactive nitrogen is lost, thus lowering the inorganic N:P 

stoichiometry (Franz et al., 2012b; Glock et al., 2013). Nitrate reduction and dissimilatory 

nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), another nitrate consuming process occurring under 

suboxic and anoxic conditions, have been identified in the Peruvian OMZ, and suggested to 

sometimes provide most of the NO2
-
 and NH4

+
 needed for anammox, respectively (Glock et 

al., 2013; Lam et al., 2009). Both heterotrophic and chemolithoautotrophic organisms are 



4 
 

able to carry out DNRA (Giblin et al., 2013). DNRA, unlike denitrification and anammox, 

conserves reactive N within the ecosystem as ammonium, which may be incorporated by 

organisms or oxidized back to nitrate. Most studies on DNRA have been carried out in 

sulfide-rich environments, with some of them showing that DNRA can be a major pathway 

for nitrogen (Giblin et al., 2013; Glock et al., 2013; Lam et al., 2009).  

Atmospheric N2 is converted to organic nitrogen by nitrogen fixing bacteria, which are the 

only organisms in the marine realm that can access the large pool of dinitrogen gas (Bohlen 

et al., 2011; Glock et al., 2013). Marine N2 fixation is mainly associated to photoautotrophic 

cyanobacteria (e.g. diazotrophs), and is the most important source of fixed new nitrogen 

when nitrogen concentrations are exhausted (Gruber, 2008). Fixed organic nitrogen is 

mostly remineralized to nitrate by two consecutive processes: ammonification and 

nitrification. Firstly, organic nitrogen is converted to NH4
+
 (ammonification) by heterotrophic 

bacteria, mostly. Then nitrifying prokaryotes carry out nitrification, by facilitating the 

oxidation of NH4
+
 to NO2

-
 and the oxidation of NO2

-
 to NO3

-
. It must be noted that 

nitrification is an aerobic process. Therefore, the expected expansion of OMZs could inhibit 

global nitrification rates (Glock et al., 2013; Gruber, 2008).

fixation and denitrification, which make the fixed nitrogen content of the ocean open to biologically 

mediated changes. Note that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) is not included. 

Extracted from Gruber (2008). 

1.3 Phosphorous cycling in Oxygen Minimum Zones 

Another essential inorganic nutrient for phytoplankton growth and life in general is 

phosphorus (P), being an integral part for energy storage and cell structure (Filippelli, 2001; 

Elser et al., 2007; White and Dyhrman, 2013). P is an essential part of adenosine 

triphosphate (ATP), therefore playing a major role in the transmission of chemical energy. 

Additionally, P is crucial for the structural framework of nucleic acids, including DNA and 

RNA (Paytan and McLaughlin, 2007). Thus, in order to determine ecosystem structure and 

function, the biogeochemical cycling of phosphorus is important and must be addressed 

(White and Dyhrman, 2013). An overview of the marine phosphorous cycle is illustrated in 

Figure 1.2. Unlike N, there are no organisms that can fix P from the atmosphere. Therefore, 



6 
 

P is often the limiting macronutrient for primary production over geological time scales 

(Paytan and McLaughlin, 2007). Like N, P partly governs the velocity at which atmospheric 

CO2 is taken up and converted to organic matter, therefore influencing the marine carbon 

cycle (Föllmi, 1996; Paytan and McLaughlin, 2007). Distribution patterns and processes of 

dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) have been studied more intensively than those of 

dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP). However, relatively recent studies revealed the 

importance of DOP as a phosphorus source for marine primary producers. In surface waters 

of coastal marine systems, DOP represents a major part of dissolved phosphorus and can 

comprise up to ~90% of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) (Ruttenberg and Dyhrman, 2012; 

White and Dyhrman, 2013). DOP is converted to bioavailable DIP through the enzymatic 

hydrolysis of organic substrates, by alkaline phosphatase and C-P lyase (Ruttenberg and 

Dyhrman, 2012). Ruttenberg and Dyhrman (2012) showed how changes in inorganic N:P 

ratios affect DOP production in coastal upwelling areas, by taking advantage of the fact that 

low concentrations of DIP induce the activity of alkaline phosphatase, thereby increasing the 

DIP concentration by converting DOP to DIP. 

The dominant input of phosphorus to the oceans is associated to continental weathering. 

Much of this input is retained within continental shelve sediments, as particulate 

phosphorus (Froelich et al., 1982; Paytan and McLaughlin, 2007). Within sediments, P is 

present as organic and inorganic forms. The fraction of organic P is very small compared to 

the bulk sediment weight, and usually is much less concentrated than DIP. Inorganic forms 

are iron and –calcium-bound and exhibit particular sensitivity to variations in the redox 

potential. Iron-bound P usually occurs in oxic surface sediments, while anoxic sediments are 

more abundant in calcium-bound P (Gomez et al., 1999; Paytan and McLaughlin, 2007). 



7 
 

After burial, iron dissolution, phosphate release and the precipitation of apatite 

(phosphorus rich mineral) may occur through various biotic and abiotic processes (White 

and Dyhrman, 2013). Generally, phosphorite deposits are interpreted as proxies for periods 

and/or locations of high biological production, as well as low oxygen concentration at the 

sediment-water interface, not only for geological records but also for modern day deposits. 

These phosphorite deposits have been identified at the continental margins of some of the 

major upwelling areas, including the Peru upwelling system (Paytan and McLaughlin, 2007). 

 

Figure 1.2: Schematic representation of the marine phosphorus cycle. Fluxes are given in italics. 
Continental weathering is the primary source of phosphorous to the oceanic phosphorous cycle. 
Most of this phosphorous is delivered via rivers, with a smaller portion delivered via dust deposition. 
In recent times, anthropogenic sources of phosphorous have become a large fraction of the 
phosphorous delivered to the marine environment, effectively doubling the pre-anthropogenic flux. 
The primary sink for phosphorous in the marine environment is loss to the sediments. Much of the 
particulate flux from rivers is lost to sediments on the continental shelves, and a smaller portion is 
lost to deep-sea sediments. Extracted from Paytan and McLaughlin (2007). 

1.4 Importance of vertical flux and inorganic N:P 

The vertical export of organic material from the surface of the ocean is a key process for the 

biological carbon pump, which is an important component of the global carbon cycle. 



8 
 

Carbon, taken up as CO2 and accumulated in phytoplankton cells via photosynthesis, is 

transported to the deep ocean (Le Moigne et al., 2015; Riebesell et al., 2007). Thus, the 

vertical flux of phytoplankton cells is to some extent responsible for the ocean´s ability to 

act as a sink for CO2 (Agusti et al., 2015). The vertical export of particulate matter is 

determined by the decomposition rate and sinking velocity of the sinking material, as well as 

active zooplankton vertical migration (Arístegui et al., 2009; Neuer, 2014). Sinking POM is 

composed of marine snow (i.e. organic aggregates), zooplankton fecal pellets and 

phytodetritus (Turner, 2015). Slow sinking particles are eaten or degraded before reaching 

greater depths, as opposed to faster sinking particles, which are likelier to reach the 

sediment (Neuer, 2014).  

Nutrient and light availability modulate phytoplankton primary production and community 

composition. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a link between phytoplankton 

community composition and export efficiency, in order to understand how changing 

environments may influence the biological carbon pump (Le Moigne et al., 2015).  

Recently, it has been recognized that the elemental stoichiometry of POM might deviate 

from the canonical Redfield ratio (Martiny et al., 2014). The composition of C:N:P of POM is 

dependent on phytoplankton community composition and physiological state. Therefore, 

observed values and trends of the elemental stoichiometry of sinking POM may be linked, at 

least in part, to phytoplankton assemblages (Quigg et al., 2003). However, it is important to 

keep in mind that during sinking, POM may be subjected to processes that alter C:N:P ratios 

(eg. remineralisation) (Deutsch and Weber, 2012; Le Moigne et al., 2015?).  

These variations in elemental composition of particulate matter may be the result of 

different mechanisms (Martiny et al., 2013b). One such mechanism refers to a decreased 



9 
 

allocation of N in phytoplankton cells as cells become N-limited, commonly resulting in a 

higher cellular C:N ratio. Another mechanism, whereby elemental ratios of particulate 

matter are influenced, is autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms specifically removing 

elements from phytodetritus. Additionally, phytoplankton growing under light limiting 

conditions may accumulate less carbon storage polymers, linking this mechanism to a 

reduced cellular C:N ratio. Furthermore, another mechanism suggests that different 

phytoplankton taxa have unique elemental stoichiometries. The last mechanism refers to 

the specific growth rate strategy (Martiny et al., 2013b). Phytoplankton cells larger than 20 

µm (microplankton) mainly rely on upwelled nitrate as a nitrogen source, while smaller cells 

(pico- and nanoplankton, 0.2 – 20 µm) are able to use regenerated nutrients (e.g., 

ammonium), even under limiting nutrient conditions. Moreover, the inorganic N:P ratio 

requirements of phytoplankton also vary across phytoplankton functional ecotypes, and 

may deviate from the canonical Redfield N:P ratio of 16:1  (Franz et al., 2012b; Hauss et al., 

2012; Meyer et al., 2016; Redfield, 1958). This behaviour has been suggested to originate in 

the specific growth rate strategy of primary producers, which allows for the broad division 

of phytoplankton into two groups, the ‘bloomers’ and the ‘survivalists’. ‘Bloomers’ 

predominantly are large-celled phytoplankton (e.g. diatoms and dinoflagellates). Their 

cellular entities contain low N:P ratio RNA. On the other hand, ‘survivalists’, mainly small-

celled phytoplankton (pico- and nanoplankton), are characterized by a higher cellular N:P 

ratio (relative to ‘bloomers’), synthesizing vast amounts of N:P rich proteins(Franz et al., 

2012b).  

The previously mentioned processes and the resulting changes in nutrient stoichiometry 

may lead to variations in the supply of dissolved nutrients to surface waters during 



10 
 

upwelling events. Therefore, dissolved inorganic macronutrient composition may affect 

phytoplankton communities, which in turn may influence the elemental stoichiometry of 

sinking POM (Gervais and Riebesell, 2001; Hauss et al., 2012; Meyer et al., 2016; Sommer et 

al., 2004).  

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of the composition of dissolved inorganic 

macronutrients in upwelled water on the elemental stoichiometry of sinking particulate 

matter off the Peruvian continental shelf.  

The specific objectives addressed the following questions:  

(1) Are upwelled waters with different dissolved inorganic N:P ratios associated to 

differences in the elemental stoichiometry of sinking particulate matter? 

(2) Are nutrient concentration and uptake related to differences in organic carbon 

export rates? 

This study presents data from a large scale in situ mesocosm experiment, conducted in 

Peruvian coastal water from the end of February to the middle of April 2017. Two 

experimental treatments with different dissolved inorganic N:P ratio were established. 

In the eight mesocosms (four replicates per treatment) nitrite, nitrate, ammonium, 

phosphate and silicate, Chl a and dissolved inorganic N:P ratio in the water column, as 

well as total particulate carbon and nitrogen, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, 

particulate inorganic carbon, particulate organic phosphorous and biogenic silica in the 

sediment traps was assessed and checked for differences between the two experimental 

treatments.

2. Materials and Methods 

2.1 Study area 

The Peruvian upwelling region is part of the eastern boundary current of the Eastern 

Tropical South Pacific (Bohlen et al., 2011). Despite the seasonal and interannual variations 

in upwelling intensity, this region is considered as one of the most productive marine 

ecosystems. The distribution of sea surface temperatures (SST) over the region, with a clear 

cross-shore gradient and colder temperatures onshore, represents the signature of coastal 

upwelling activity (Fig. 2.1A). Upwelled colder nutrient-rich water masses, with high 

concentrations of nitrate, phosphorus and silicate (Capone and Hutchins, 2013), lead to high 

levels of phytoplankton primary productivity, as indicated by high surface chlorophyll a 

concentration over the continental shelf (Fig. 2.1B). The high primary production at the 

surface and the consequent sinking of organic matter accompanied by oxic microbial 

respiration, gives rise to the most intense marine oxygen minimum zone (Gier et al., 2016).

2.2 Experimental design  

The influence of dissolved inorganic macronutrient ratios (i.e. N:P) on the elemental 

stoichiometry of sinking particulate matter and vertical exportation off the Peruvian 

continental shelf was investigated using a dedicated large scale in situ mesocosm 

experiment. The experiment was conducted from February to April 2017 and the mesocosm 

mooring site was located north of Isla San Lorenzo, off the Lima coast (12° 03.328' S, 077° 

14.086' W; Fig. 2.2), within the region of maximum primary productivity of the Peruvian 

upwelling system (Bohlen et al., 2011; Bruland et al., 2005).

Viewer at https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/ 

 

2.2.1 Experimental units: Mesocosms 

The in situ mesocosm experiment was based on the mobile sea-going Kiel Off-Shore 

Mesocosms for Ocean Simulations (KOSMOS) (Fig. 2.3A). This system includes eight 

mesocosm units. Each unit consists of a 20m long flexible polyurethane foil bag (2m in 

Lima ® 

 

Peru 



14 
 

diameter, 1mm thick; approximate capacity of 60 m
3
), mounted to a metal flotation frame. 

At the bottom, each mesocosm unit is equipped with a sediment trap. The collection 

cylinder is connected to a sediment trap funnel to the top. To the bottom, it is connected to 

a silicon tube, which is attached to the flotation frame above the sea surface. A wire helix 

hose covers the first 1.5m of the silicon tube, to prevent current related bending of the tube 

(see details in Figure 2.3B). During deployment of the mesocosm units, the bags were sealed 

at the bottom and top with a 3mm mesh size net, to exclude large zooplankton and nekton 

from the experiment. Once lowered in the water column, the mesocosm bags were left 

open for approximately 3 days in order to ensure a complete exchange of the water body, 

thus promoting similar starting conditions inside all mesocosm units.

2.2.2 Evaluation of mesocosm volumes 

The volume of each mesocosm was determined by using a dispersion device “spider” 

(Riebesell et al 2013), in order to evenly distribute a known amount of salt brine (52000g) to 

each of the mesocosm units. This was done via a pulley construction (Fig. 2.4) by gradually 

moving the spider up and down the entire mesocosm water column, while the salt brine 

(solution) was pumped through the “spider”. Salinity measurements were done before and 

after salt brine addition, using a multisensory CTD CTD60M (Sun and Sea Technologies). The 

resulting change in salinity, allowed the precise evaluation of mesocosm volume (see Czerny 

et al. 2013, for a detailed description).

2.2.3 Experimental treatments 

Two experimental treatments, with 4 replicates each, were prepared to test the effects of 

N:P nutrient ratios. OMZ influenced water masses, below the surface of the tropical South 

East Pacific, may have a remarkably low N:P ratio (relative to the Redfield ratio). Upwelling 

on the narrow continental shelf supplies surface waters with these water masses of low N:P 

ratio. N:P ratios below the Redfield ratio of 16:1 off the Peruvian coast have been identified, 



16 
 

and decreasing N:P ratios may be related to the expansion of OMZs (Franz et al., 2012a; 

Franz et al., 2012b).  

OMZ water was collected at two different stations from a depth of approximately 40m, 

close to the seafloor, in the vicinity of the mooring site. After the deployment and closure of 

the eight mesocosms, known volumes (22000 L) of each of the two different OMZ derived 

water masses were added to the 4 replicate mesocosms of each experimental treatment, in 

order to stimulate upwelling. Prior to water addition, a slightly lower volume of water was 

pumped out of the mesocosms. For each mesocosm, OMZ water was added at two depth 

levels, mesocosm surface (0.5-9.0m) and bottom levels (14-17m), on day 12 (after sampling) 

and 11, respectively. The properties of the retrieved OMZ water masses are listed in Tables 

2 and 3. Mesocosms 1, 4, 5 and 8 were used for the very low N:P treatment, while 

mesocosms 2, 3, 6 and 7 were used for the low N:P treatment.  

 

2.3 Mesocosm sampling procedure 

2.3.1 Water column sampling 

Water samples were regularly collected during the experiment, starting after mesocosm 

closure (closure marked day 0). Sampling was undertaken every 48 hours, with the 

exception of the periods between days 1-4 and 12-18 where sampling was undertaken every 

24 hours, always after sediment sampling. An integrating water sampler (IWS, Hydrobios) 

was used for dissolved inorganic macronutrients (NO3
-
, NO2

-
, NH4

+
, PO4

3-
 and Si(OH)4

-
). 

Samples were transferred to acid-cleaned (10% HCl) plastic bottles, filtered through 

cellulose acetate filters (nominal pore size: 0.45 µm, GF/F, Whatman) to reduce 



17 
 

contamination effects, and analysed on the day of sampling. Suspended particulate matter 

was also sampled using integrating water samplers. During sampling, samples were 

protected from direct sunlight and stored in 5L canisters inside cooling boxes. Subsampling 

from canisters was done after manual homogenization, to ensure no particulate matter was 

accumulated at the carboy bottom. Concentration of both dissolved inorganic 

macronutrients and suspended particulate matter represented depth-integrated values for 

each mesocosm, since the sampling system allowed constant sampling of the entire water 

column, with homogeneous sampling throughout the entire mesocosm depth.  

 2.3.2 Sediment trap sampling 

Sampling of the material accumulated inside the sediment traps was conducted every 48 

hours, always before water sampling to avoid dispersion of the sediment trap material into 

the water column. The deposited material was (vacuum) pumped through the silicon tube 

and collected into 5L Schott Duran® glass flasks (Fig. 2.3B). At first sign of particles, visually 

detected through the Plexiglas® pipe, pumping was interrupted and seawater collected into 

the glass flasks was discarded, if clear. The vacuum sampling method was then reapplied. 

This sampling procedure ensured a minimized disturbance of the enclosed water body as 

well as an easy and efficient recovery of sedimented material. To avoid warming and 

increased bacterial degradation of the organic matter, glass flasks were stored inside large 

boxes, filled with cooling elements, throughout the sediment sampling and laboratory 

processing periods.

2.4.1 Dissolved inorganic macronutrients 

The concentration of dissolved NO3
-
, NO2

-
, NH4

+
, PO4

3-
, Si(OH)4

-
, was analysed directly after 

IWS sampling, using a SEAL Analytical QuAAtro AutoAnalyzer, connected to JASCO Model 

FP-2020 Intelligent Fluorescence Detector and a SEAL Analytical XY2 autosampler. 

Measurement procedures followed methods described by Hydes et al. (2010). For a detailed 

description of the determination of nitrite and nitrate, ammounium, phosphate and silicate, 

see Morris and Riley (1963), Kérouel and Aminot (1997), Murphy and Riley (1962) and 

Mullin and Riley (1965), respectively.  

2.4.2 Suspended particulate matter 

Subsamples were taken from the canisters for the analyses of chlorophyll a concentration 

(Chl a) and filtered onto combusted glass fibre filters (nominal pore size: 0.7 µm, 25 mm 

diameter, Whatman), using a gentle vacuum (&amp;lt;200 mbar). Fluorometric determination of 

Chl a was carried out, using the method developed by Welschmeyer (1994).  

2.4.3 Particulate matter accumulated inside sediment traps 

After sediment sample collection and transport to laboratory facilities, sample volumes 

were determined gravimetrically. Subsamples (&lt;10% of bulk sample volume) for other 

variables were taken after sample homogenization, by gently shaking the glass flasks. In 

order to separate sediment particles from (bulk) seawater, first, precipitation of the 

sediment trap particles was achieved by adding 3M FeCl3 and 3M NaOH simultaneously at a 

ratio of 0,12 ?l : 0,39 ?l per gram of sample weight. The ratio of FeCl3 to NaOH was 

previously determined, by adding increasing amounts of FeCl3 to samples of day 0, until 



19 
 

maximum precipitation with minimal FeCl3 input was visually determined. NaOH was then 

added until the pH values of the samples were close to 8,1 again. After 1 hour of settling 

time, the clear supernatant was carefully removed, using a vacuum pump. The remaining 

particle suspensions inside the 5L sampling flasks were then transferred to 800mL centrifuge 

beakers, and centrifuged for ~10 min at 5236 xg using a 6-16 KS centrifuge (Sigma). To 

prevent particle re-suspension, a slow deceleration was applied. After carefully discarding 

the supernatant, the remaining sample pellets were transferred into 110mL centrifuge tubes 

and the same procedure was applied until the 5L sampling flasks are empty. The small tubes 

were then centrifuged for ~10 min at 5039 xg, using a 3K12 centrifuge (Sigma) and after 

discarding the supernatant, the sediment pellets were immediately frozen at -20°C, inside 

plastic screw cap cups. Freeze-drying the sediment pellet samples for up to 72 hours 

removed the remaining water. Once all the water has been removed, sample pellets were 

enclosed inside a hollow sphere of 4VA steel, deep-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground 

into a homogeneous fine powder using the ball-mill developed by Boxhammer et al. (2015). 

The steps involved from sediment sample collection to grinding are summarized in Figure 

2.5. For more details see Boxhammer et al. (2015).

drying (4) and grinding (5-8) to convert heterogeneous sediment trap samples into homogeneous 

powder for biogeochemical analysis. Adapted from Boxhammer et al. (2015). 

 

Subsamples of the sediment pellet powder were used to determine the concentration of 

total particulate carbon (TPCSED), nitrogen (TPNSED), particulate organic phosphorous 

(POPSED), biogenic silicate (BSiSED), particulate organic carbon (POCSED) and nitrogen (PONSED). 

Two mg subsamples were transferred into tin cups and TPCSED, TPNSED, POCSED and PONSED 

was measured using an elemental analyser (Euro EA-CN, Hekatech), calibrated with 

acetanilide (C8H9NO) and soil standard (Hekatech, catalogue number HE33860101). PICSED 

was calculated by subtracting POCSED from TPCSED.  



21 
 

For POPSED analysis, two mg subsamples were placed into 40 mL glass vials, containing a 

40mL solution of deionized water and an oxidizing decomposition reagent (Merck, catalogue 

no. 112936). Particulate organic phosphorous was oxidized to orthophosphate by 

autoclaving at 121
o
C for 30 minutes in a pressure cooker. After sample cooling, a 

spectrophotometric analysis, similar to the method of Hansen and Koroleff (1999) for 

dissolved inorganic phosphorous, was used to determine POPSED concentrations.  

BSiSED from the sediment pellet powder was leached by alkaline pulping with 0.1 M NaOH at 

85°C for 135 minutes. Adding 0.05 M H2SO4 terminated the leaching process, after which a 

spectrophotometric analysis similar to Hansen and Koroleff (1999) was used for the 

determination of BSiSED concentrations. 

 

 

2.5 Statistical analysis 

The effects of nutrient ratio on the elemental stoichiometry of sinking particulate matter 

were tested using the Student´s t-test. Similarly, the effects of nutrient uptake on POC 

export rates to the sediment traps were also tested using the Student´s t-test. An F-test two 

sample for variances was used to assess homogeneity of variance. Descriptive statistics 

(Curtosis-skewness-mean and median) were applied to check if data distribution was 

approximately normally. If not normally distributed, data were log transformed and tested 

for normality and homogeneity again, before running the Student t-test.  All statistical 

analyses were conducted using Microsoft Excel 2010, using a significance level of p&lt;0.05.

3.2 Sediment trap accumulated material and vertical fluxes 

The fluxes of all parameters increased over the first eight days, followed by a large drop at 

day 10 (Fig. 3.4). Maximum fluxes for TPCSED, TPNSED, POCSED, PONSED, PICSED and BsiSED were 

reached on day 12 or 14, shortly after OMZ water additions. POPSED fluxes reached 

maximum values of 0.31/0.26 µmol L

there was another temporal maximum around days 12 to 14. TPCSED, TPNSED, POCSED and 

PONSED fluxes decreased after OMZ water additions from day 14 to 16 and stayed relatively 

constant until they increased again towards the end of the experiment. BSiSED fluxes 

declined continuously after reaching maximum values on days 12 to 14. Close to zero values 

were observed from day 28 onwards. POCSED and PONSED represented &gt;95% of TPCSED and 

TPNSED, respectively, with some exceptions. None of the parameters were significantly 

different between treatments (Table 3.2).

treatments (n=4). Error bars represent standard deviations of four replicates. 

 

 

Elevated C:N ratios, compared to the Redfield ratio, for both treatments were observed for 

almost the entire course of the experiment (Fig. 3.5). A more pronounce decrease in C:N 

ratios was evident from day 36 onwards, reaching slightly lower than Redfield C:N ratios 

towards the end of the experiment. C:P and N:P ratios for both treatments stayed mostly 

below the Redfield ratio of 106 and 16, respectively (Fig. 3.5). Increasing C:P and N:P ratios 



27 
 

were observed towards the middle of the experiment, followed by a decline from day 34 

onwards. Mean C:P and N:P values within the last ten days of the experiment dropped to 

values as low as 9.1/12.7 (very low/low N:P) and 1.6/2.0 (very low/low N:P), respectively. 

Mean PIC:POC values for both treatments stayed relatively constant after a decrease within 

the first four to six days (Fig. 3.5). PIC:POC ratios for both treatments were always below 

0.08. No significant differences between treatments in any of the ratios were observed 

(Table 3.2).

Note that C:N=POC:PON, C:P=POC:POP and N:P=PON:POP. 

 

 

Cumulative fluxes to the sediment trap for TPC, TPN, POC and PON showed a constant 

increase over time for both experimental treatments (Fig.13). These fluxes became slightly 

higher in the low N:P treatment starting on day 26. Similarly, cumulative POP sediment trap 

fluxes over time increased gradually for the first 40 days in both treatments, but the 

accumulation rate increased substantially from day 40 onwards (Fig. 3.6). Opposite to that, 



28 
 

there was a more intense increase for the initial 18 days in cumulative BSi sediment trap 

fluxes in both treatments, while accumulation ceased thereafter (Fig. 3.6). Additionally, 

once the accumulation declined after day 18, fluxes in the low N:P treatment were slightly 

higher, compared to the very low N:P treatment. No statistically significant differences 

between treatments for any of the parameters were found (Table 3.2).  

  

  

  

Figure 3.6: Mean cumulative particulate matter collected in the sediment traps (n=4). Error bars 

represent standard deviations of four replicates. 

 

 

Total export of POC to the sediment traps per utilized dissolved inorganic N in the water 

column was 8.97 and 4.91 for the very low and low N:P treatment, respectively (Fig. 3.7). 

Statistically, the difference between the two treatments was not significant (Table 3.2), 

although their average value was markedly different (Fig. 3.7). Even though more DIN was 



29 
 

used under the low N:P mesocosms compared to the very low N:P mesocosms (appendix 

Table 6.2), POC export per utilized N in the water column was lower (Fig. 3.7). Interestingly, 

the reason as to why the treatments seem different, with respect to this parameter, is 

mesocosm 4 having a much higher value compared to all other mesocosms (appendix Fig. 

6.3).

4. Discussion 

Since there have been no statistically significant differences in any of the parameters 

between the two experimental treatments, this discussion will mainly focus on the observed 

trends of the treatments over time. Furthermore, possible explanations as to why there 

have not been any statistically significant differences between the treatments will be 

discussed.  

4.1 How accurate was upwelling simulation? 

Simulated upwelling using water masses with different dissolved inorganic N:P ratios did not 

lead to changes in the elemental stoichiometry of sinking particulate matter (Table. 1). This 

is likely due to the fact, that the dissolved inorganic N:P ratio in the mesocosms, throughout 

the entire experimental period, also did not differ significantly, even though the OMZ water 

added to the low N:P mesocosms showed a dissolved inorganic N:P ratio 15-fold higher than 

the very low N:P treatment (Table 3.1). The proportion of dissolved inorganic N to P in 

seawater may promote particular plankton communities, with certain biogeochemical 

consequences, based on the species specific metabolic requirements (Deutsch and Weber, 

2012). Both treatments reached close to zero values in these dissolved inorganic nutrient 

proportions shortly after OMZ water additions, most likely due to phytoplankton removing 

reactive N from the water. This finding is supported by decreasing concentrations of NO3
-
 

(and NO2
-
) after OMZ water additions (Fig. 3.1), probably making N the limiting nutrient for 

phytoplankton growth, since P in the mesocosms was available in high concentrations 

throughout the entire experiment. DIN concentrations below 1 ?M and dissolved inorganic 

N:P ratios below 10 have been attributed to nitrogen limitation (Dortch and Whitledge, 



31 
 

1992). However, it has been shown that in situ concentrations and ratios of nutrients may 

not suffice in evaluating the occurrence of nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth 

(Domingues et al., 2017). 

It is important to not only look at nutrient stoichiometry but also address absolute 

concentrations of nutrients, especially in the OMZ derived water masses. Nutrient 

concentration also influences plankton community composition, since small phytoplankton 

taxa may outcompete larger cells under nutrient scarce conditions (Franz et al., 2012b). The 

observed concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen species in the retrieved OMZ water 

masses, especially nitrate, were much lower than expected, even for an OMZ influenced 

upwelling event (appendix Table 6.1). Indeed, Franz et al. (2012b) reported nitrate 

concentrations over 25 ?mol L
-1

 over the shallow Peruvian coastal waters (&lt;100m). 

However, the added water masses in this experiment were retrieved very close to the 

seafloor. Therefore, dissolved inorganic N concentrations of the collected water masses may 

also have been reduced due to the coupling between sediments and overlying water. 

Sediments can act as sources or sinks for nutrients, and biogeochemical processes occurring 

within the sediment and the pelagic zone are closely coupled (McGlathery et al., 2004). 

Nutrient fluxes at the sediment-water interface in coastal oceans are important processes 

affecting the chemical composition of the overlying water, ultimately influencing primary 

productivity (Callender and Hammond, 1982). Variations in physical-chemical factors and 

hydrodynamic disturbances may lead to a release of nutrients from the sediment to the 

overlying water (Yang et al., 2017). Dissolved inorganic N:P ratios lower than the Redfield 

ratio of 16:1 (Redfield, 1958) have been reported in coastal waters of the Eastern Tropical 

North Atlantic as a result of benthic N-loss to and P release from the sediment (Meyer et al., 



32 
 

2016). Furthermore, chemical nutrient conditions of the two OMZ water masses mostly 

were very similar to each other (Table 3.1 and 3). This may largely explain why the 

treatments were not significantly different from one another.   

As can be seen in Figure 15 (appendix), dissolved oxygen concentration inside all 

mesocosms decreased rapidly with depth below 5m, but oxic conditions were observed for 

most of the water column. Decreasing oxygen concentrations have been correlated with 

increasing denitrification rates (Gruber, 2008), a process commonly associated with nitrogen 

losses in OMZs. However, low concentrations of NO3
-
 and NH4

+
 may indicate anammox 

activity in suboxic waters (Arrigo, 2005), a process related to nitrogen loss over the 

Benguela OMZ (Kuypers et al., 2005).  

 

4.2 Water column properties 

In order to ensure optimal starting conditions for the experiment, similarity in chemical and 

biological conditions between mesocosm bags after closure is desired (Riebesell et al., 

2013). However, initial concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients varied across 

mesocosms, especially for NO2
-
 and NH4

+
 (appendix Table 6.3). It is notable that lowest 

values for all variables were observed in mesocosm 4 (M4). This information can be used to 

explain the remarkably different behaviour of M4 during parts of the experimental period, 

for some variables (see below).  

Chl a ranged between 3.0 and 7.0 ?g L
-1

 for the first 40 days of the experiment, in both 

treatments, despite the depletion in all dissolved inorganic nitrogen species after day 18. 

Therefore, since Chl a did not decrease, phytoplankton biomass was probably supported by 



33 
 

other sources, including remineralized PON/DON or direct DON uptake. Remineralisation of 

PON and DON increases the concentration of dissolved inorganic nutrients (Gruber, 2008), 

but no visible subsequent increase in any of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen species was 

observed immediately after their depletion (Fig. 3.1). This fact could reflect a fast 

incorporation of remineralized N by phytoplankton, as soon as it was made available. The 

relatively low sampling frequency, with a long 48h period between successive sampling 

stages, only allowed a glimpse of the “bigger picture”, not evaluating short-term processes 

of nutrient production and use. Additionally, it has been hypothesized that excess 

phosphate favours increased rates of N2-fixation by diazotrophs (Deutsch et al., 2007; 

Meyer et al., 2016). Phosphate has been present for the whole course of the experiment 

(Fig. 3.1), but data on organic nitrogen in the water column is needed, in order to make 

more accurate inferences. Microzooplankton as consumers of phytoplankton (mostly 

protists), may have also had a relevant role in remineralization processes, through excretion 

of inorganic nutrients and introduction of fecal pellets into the POM pool (Calbet and 

Landry, 2004; Turner, 2015). Enhanced remineralization of phosphate and ammonium has 

been observed in the presence of microzooplankton (Le Moigne et al., 2013).   

Previous studies have shown that DON compounds (e.g., urea), that usually represent the 

largest pool of bioavailable N in most aquatic systems (Bronk et al., 2007), can be a viable 

direct source of reactive N to phytoplankton, particularly when competing for limited 

dissolved inorganic N with heterotrophic prokaryotes (Berman et al., 1999; Bradley et al., 

2010; Bronk et al., 2007). Furthermore, it is likely that the phytoplankton assemblage in the 

second half of the experiment was dominated by organisms other than diatoms, since BSiSED 

fluxes were almost non-existent.  



34 
 

The direct ingestion of living prey by mixotrophic phytoplankton could also explain the 

continuous increase in Chl a during the second half of the experiment, under reduced 

nutrient conditions. According to the review of Stoecker et al. (2017), mixotrophic 

phytoplankton, including dinoflagellates and nanoflagellates, are ubiquitous in coastal 

oceans and are associated with upwelling zones. For these phagotrophic organisms, 

dissolved inorganic nutrient acquisition is supplemented or substituted by the ingestion of 

prey. Additionally, mixotrophy may also stimulate vertical carbon export through a more 

efficient transfer of organic matter into larger plankton, ultimately improving the efficiency 

of the biological carbon pump (Hammer and Pitchford, 2006; Stoecker et al., 2017). 

 

4.3 Elemental stoichiometry of sinking particulate matter 

The proportion of particulate organic carbon to nitrogen (C:N ratio) is of fundamental 

importance in ocean biogeochemistry, as it relates to the efficiency of carbon sequestration, 

secondary production and the biological pump. It also holds valuable information for the 

coupling between the carbon and nitrogen cycles (Martiny et al., 2013a and b; Sterner et al., 

2008).  

C:N ratios were higher than the Redfield ratio (6.6) for almost the entire experimental 

period (Fig. 3.5). N limitation and lower dissolved N:P ratios have been linked with high 

particulate C:N ratios (Martiny et al., 2013b). Since N concentrations in the added water 

masses in this study were remarkably low for an upwelling event (Franz et al., 2012b), 

leading to dissolved N:P ratios well below the Redfield ratio, the observed C:N ratio in the 

sinking particulate matter may be attributed to N limitation, ultimately resulting in a lower 

nitrogen cell quota for phytoplankton (Martiny et al., 2013b). C:N ratios gradually 



35 
 

decreased, reaching values close to or below the Redfield ratio as the end of the experiment 

approached (Fig. 3.5), even though DIN concentrations only increased slightly (Fig. 3.1). 

Additionally, phytoplankton growing under light limitation may accumulate less carbon 

storage polymers (Martiny et al., 2013b), therefore resulting in a decreased cellular C:N 

ratio. Biological matter that settled on the outside wall of the mesocosm bags was cleaned 

regularly, to a depth of approximately 6m. Below that, no cleaning was carried out. Thus, 

PAR intensity inside the mesocosms showed a substantial decline below 6 m depth level, 

eventually leading to increased light limitation (appendix Fig. 6.1 top). It could be argued 

that this gradual decrease of light availability is linked to the relatively constant decrease of 

C:N, as phytoplankton during the experiment accumulated less and less carbon storage 

polymers over time.  

PIC:POC ratios, often used as a measure of carbon export (Gerecht et al., 2014), stayed 

relatively constant for the entire experimental period. Decreased PIC:POC ratios are linked 

to a higher potential for oceanic CO2 uptake and, therefore, a higher drawdown of 

atmospheric CO2 on longer time scales (Fielding, 2014; Gerecht et al., 2014). The PIC:POC 

ratios observed in this study were very low, staying&amp;lt;0.08 at all times (Findlay et al., 2011; 

Gerecht et al., 2014). Calcifying phytoplankton (e.g., coccolithophores) fix HCO3
-
 into PIC 

through calcification (i.e., production of calcium carbonate cocccoliths), and into POC 

through photosynthesis (Bach, 2015; Gerecht et al., 2014; Monteiro et al., 2016). Thus, since 

PICSED concentrations were also low (Fig. 3.4), the impact of calcifying organisms on the CO2 

fixation to POC was probably reduced in this study. 

Both C:P and N:P ratios were well below the Redfield ratios throughout most of the 

experimental period (Fig. 3.5). According to Arrigo (2005), the cellular C:P and N:P ratios of 



36 
 

eukaryotic phytoplankton vary markedly between the green and red plastid superfamilies. 

The red superfamily (ca. C:P =70,  N:P = 10) usually exhibits significantly lower ratios than 

the green superfamily (C:P ~200, N:P ~27). Thus, it can be argued that the observed ratios 

are the result of phytoplankton assemblages mainly composed by representatives of the red 

plastid superfamily. Diatoms are included in the red superfamily (Quigg et al., 2003), and the 

BSiSED concentrations during the first half of the experiment inside the sediment traps, 

support their presence (Nelson et al., 1995). C:P and N:P lower than Redfield ratios, as 

observed in this study, have been measured for diatoms (Martiny et al., 2013a). The 

remarkably low values for the last ~ten days of the experiment probably reflected the steep 

increase in POPSED during this period (Fig. 3.4). An increase in POP of such magnitude is 

unexpected and was likely the result of guano deposition by seabirds. Seabird guano, rich in 

nitrogen and phosphorous, is associated with enhanced phytoplankton productivity and 

may alter species composition of the phytoplankton community (Bosman and Hockey, 1986; 

Shatova et al., 2017; Wootton, 1991). Deposition of seabird guano in the Bering Sea was 

associated with tenfold increases in the uptake of mineral and organic compounds by 

phytoplankton, as well as peaks in phytoplankton biomass (Wainright et al., 1998). Thus, the 

remarkably low C:P and N:P ratios in the sediment traps at the end of the experiment may 

be due to increased phytoplankton biomass. This statement was supported by a steep rise 

in Chl a during the later stage of the experiment. Furthermore, increasing POC and PON 

fluxes into the sediment traps from day 40 onwards also supported this (Fig. 3.4). Seabirds, 

particularly inca terns (Larosterna inca), were increasingly sighted, sitting on the metal rings 

and cleats of the mesocosms over the last two weeks of the experiment. We have also 

observed guano input by inca terns many times. In addition, an increased occurrence of 

large fish (&gt;10cm) inside the sediment traps was observed from day 34 onwards. Since we 



37 
 

have also seen some inca terns dropping their prey into the mesocosms, this increased 

observation of fish within the sediment trap material coincided with increased sightings of 

seabirds on the mesocosms. Fish and fish remains (e.g., bones) were removed from the 

sediment trap samples to the best of our ability. Whenever there were indications of fish 

contamination of sediment trap material, the entire material was filtered through a mesh 

(2mm mesh size), and fish remains were carefully picked out and washed with filtered 

seawater (0.2?m), in order to minimize sample loss, while maximizing fish removal. 

Therefore, the increase in particulate matter for the last 10 days was probably associated 

with the fertilization of mesocosms with guano, and the subsequent stimulation of 

phytoplankton net growth rate. Efforts to deter seabirds were increased, once they became 

more abundant, but no satisfying result was achieved as birds kept on coming back to the 

mesocosms.   

 

4.4 Vertical export 

An inverse relationship between export efficiency and primary production (PP) has been 

observed in multiple studies (Le Moigne et al., 2016; Maiti et al., 2013). If we assume that 

utilized N is an indicator of total PP, PP was higher in the low N:P mesocosms. M4 showed 

the lowest Chl a for most of the experimental period, supporting this statement (appendix 

Fig. 6.2). Furthermore, less dissolved inorganic N was apparently used inside M4 (Table 6.2). 

Therefore, the export efficiency inside M4 was probably higher, in respect to other 

mesocosms. Potential hypothesis explaining this unexpected relationship include intense 

surface microbial recycling in high PP areas and grazing-mediated export that varies 

inversely with PP (Le Moigne et al., 2016). However, caution is advised when comparing 



38 
 

those findings with results of this study, since these studies have been carried out in the 

Southern Ocean.  

Cumulative fluxes of TPC, TPN, POC, PON and BSi into the sediment traps were almost 

always higher under the low N:P treatment, especially in the second half of the experiment 

(Fig. 3.6). Even though not significant, this pattern agreed with previous studies that report 

an increased exportation when nutrient availability and PP are higher (Le Moigne et al., 

2016; Haskell, 2015). Since slightly more nutrients (nitrogen in particular) were available and 

apparently utilized under the low N:P treatment (Table 6.2 and Fig. 3.1), the slightly higher 

cumulative fluxes of TPC, TPN, POC, PON and BSi into the sediment traps are justified. 

Higher accumulation rates in cumulative BSiSED fluxes during the beginning of the 

experiment (Fig. 3.6) were associated with greater BSiSED fluxes at the same time (Fig. 3.4), 

probably a result of diatom blooms, until dissolved inorganic nitrogen became depleted (Fig. 

3.1). Organisms other than diatoms, such as choanoflagellates and radiolaria, may also have 

contributed to BSiSED fluxes by undergoing biosilicification (Marron et al., 2013). The future 

evaluation of plankton composition will allow their quantification, if relevant. 

 

4.5 Conclusions and outlook 

In this study, water masses with different dissolved inorganic N:P ratios, associated with 

OMZ influenced upwelling events, were not associated with differences in the elemental 

stoichiometry of sinking particulate matter. Furthermore, apparent nutrient uptake was not 

related to differences in POC exportation rates. Our results showed clear deviations from 

the canonical Redfield ratio in sinking POM, hypothesized to be related with phytoplankton 

community composition. Quantitative data on phytoplankton composition, which will be 



39 
 

made available in the next months (after the deadline of this master thesis), should be used 

for testing this hypothesis. Sinking POM is partly composed of zooplankton fecal pellets and 

the vertical export of particulate matter is, to some extent, influenced by active zooplankton 

migration. Therefore, the influence of zooplankton on elemental stoichiometries of sinking 

particulate matter should be further considered.  

Furthermore, the potential importance of DON as source of N for phytoplankton, as well as 

the ingestion of living prey, must be assessed. Thus, once community data is available, the 

occurrence of mixotrophic phytoplankton taxa should be specifically evaluated. Additionally, 

DON concentrations could help to shed light on the nutritional source for phytoplankton 

(DON data will also only be made available after the deadline of this thesis). 

Potential issues during this experimental study included seabird disturbances (e.g., guano 

and prey input). In regions with high seabird abundances, a more effective strategy to deter 

seabirds from the mesocosms should be applied, such as spanning a thin net layer between 

the mesocosm roof and metal rings. Since this would greatly impede and slow down 

sampling procedures, such a net should be limited to sites of the mesocosms where no 

sampling is carried out. Furthermore, the net should be thin, with a relatively large mesh 

size, in order to minimize its impact on PAR entering the mesocosms. Since the two added 

OMZ derived water masses were remarkably similar to each other, also chemical and 

biological parameters throughout the experiment were relatively similar to each other. A 

second OMZ water collection and addition was planned to be carried out, but could not be 

realized, due to technical difficulties.  

The ocean´s ability to transfer carbon away from the surface to the deep ocean is of 

fundamental importance in reducing CO2 in the atmosphere, without which, accelerated 



40 
 

atmospheric CO2 growth would be observed, since more anthropogenic CO2 would remain 

in the atmosphere (Le Moigne et al., 2013; Le Quéré et al., 2010). Therefore, 

biogeochemical processes that alter carbon export or elemental stoichiometries are 

important aspects in changing ocean environments and must be discussed, in order to 

understand the coupling between these processes.
