Abstract  
 

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are recalcitrant compounds considered as priority 

pollutants in soil, water and the atmosphere. They can have natural origin (fires, volcanic eruptions, 

among others) or anthropogenic origin by the incomplete combustion of organic matter (coal, oil, wood). 

This is not only an environmental problem but also impacts on public health, since studies that indicate 

the toxicity and mutagenic/carcinogenic effects of PAHs are reported. 

Many attempts have been made to develop strategies to eliminate these compounds. Bioremediation 

has emerged as a possible solution to the problem using microorganisms and taking advantage of their 

degrading capacity to reduce or eliminate the presence of PAHs. The presence of PAHs on planet Earth 

through the evolution of life shaped the evolution of metabolic pathways allowing microorganisms to 

use these compounds as carbon and energy sources.  

A screening of forty-seven strains (Biotask Bioremediation Culture collection) from adaptive 

evolution experiments was performed. The initial inoculum of the experiments was from a wastewater 

treatment plant. In order to evaluate the degradative potential of these strains, growth assays were 

performed with naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene as the only source of carbon and energy. 

Directly, an HPLC method was developed and optimized that allowed the quantification of PAHs 

present in the biological samples. Indirectly, a cell viability study was performed through the most 

probable numbers. The most recent cycle of adaptive evolution revealed the best results as expected. 

The selection of the best degraders was performed through a principal component analysis. In 

addition, an environmental contaminant revealed an interesting degradative behaviour and was included 

in the BBC collection. 

Sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, allowed the four strains to be presumptively identified 

as belonging to the genus Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Paraburkholderia. 

Characterization of the strains involved three phases. Initially, the growth of the microorganisms 

was monitored having the PAHs as the carbon source for 15 days, both individually and in a consortium. 

The strain belonging to the genus Pseudomonas present the best results and possibly a bi-phasic growth. 

The consortium also revealed that strains together yield better results than individual growth. Then, the 

production of biosurfactants was evaluated qualitatively through the observation of an emulsion and 

quantitatively through the measurement of surface tension. The strain belonging to the genus 

Acinetobacter was the only one that apparently synthesizes a compound with surfactant activity. Finally, 

the presence of genes associated with PAH catabolism and growth having the metabolic intermediate 

phthalate as the sole source of carbon was evaluated. The strains belonging to the genera Pseudomonas 

and Paraburkholderia were the ones that presented greater metabolic plasticity. 

In summary, it can be concluded that the objective of the work was achieved, and the most 

promising strains with higher potential for degradation of PAHs were selected and studied in metabolic 

and genetic terms. The growth of the strains in the consortium was successfully achieved and some 

characteristics that may explain strains degradative behaviour were revealed. More studies will be 

needed to elucidate more clearly the whole process in order to build an effective consortium for the 

bioremediation of contaminated sites.

Resumo 
 

Os hidrocarbonetos aromáticos policíclicos (HAP) são poluentes ambientais encontrados na 

água, no solo e na atmosfera. Estes compostos são de elevada importância devido ao perigo que 

representam em termos de saúde humana e em termos ambientais, existindo uma lista de 16 HAP 

considerados poluentes prioritários, apresentando propriedades tóxicas, mutagénicas e/ou 

carcinogénicas. 

Por um lado, podem ser gerados naturalmente através de fogos florestais, atividade vulcânica e 

derramamentos de petróleo. Por outro lado, podem ter origem em atividades antropogénicas durante a 

combustão incompleta de materiais orgânicos, como o óleo, o petróleo ou a madeira. O facto de serem 

insolúveis em água dificulta a sua remoção e consequentemente leva a que se tornem recalcitrantes no 

meio ambiente, persistindo por muitos anos. 

Várias tecnologias de remediação têm sido testadas com o objetivo de remover estes 

contaminantes ambientais. Muitas das abordagens têm uma natureza química, o que além de se traduzir 

em elevados custos económicos também está associado à geração de subprodutos também de natureza 

tóxica. Recentemente, a biorremediação têm sido alvo de atenção já que o uso de microrganismos para 

remoção de HAP tem sido vista como uma opção mais segura e com menos custos. Vários géneros de 

bactérias Gram positivas e Gram negativas, bem como fungos e algas capazes de utilizar estes compostos 

como fonte de carbono e energia têm sido isolados e caraterizados. Na natureza, são raras as vezes que 

estes microrganismos com capacidade de degradar poluentes se encontram individualmente. 

Geralmente, existem em consórcio, ou seja, associações naturais de vários microrganismos diferentes 

que interagem sinergicamente entre si, aumentando a eficiência de degradação. Esta cooperação resulta 

por exemplo em interações onde os produtos metabólicos de um microrganismo podem ser o substrato 

para outro microrganismo.  

Nas estações de tratamento de águas residuais, o objetivo é obter um efluente que possa retornar 

ao ciclo da água com o mínimo impacto no ambiente. Neste contexto ecológico, os microrganismos 

geralmente realizam metabolismo aeróbio, tendo o oxigénio como aceitador final de eletrões. 

Catabolicamente, as enzimas com atividade de dioxigenase têm um papel fundamental na ativação do 

HAP para degradação. Um aspeto do metabolismo aeróbio é a formação de intermediários metabólicos 

como o salicilato, o catecol, o gentisato e o ftalato que após reações enzimáticas originaram metabolitos 

que compõem o ciclo dos ácidos tricarboxílicos. Estas proteínas com atividade catalítica estão 

amplamente distribuídas por diferentes microrganismos, considerando-se mesmo a existência de 

diferentes famílias de enzimas associadas a determinados taxa microbianos. 

 Além disso, verifica-se uma plasticidade metabólica no que diz respeito à degradação destes 

compostos podendo ocorrer também degradação em condições de anaerobiose, tendo compostos 

inorgânicos como o sulfato, o nitrato e o ferro como aceitadores de eletrões. No entanto, ainda existe 

muito por revelar sobre este metabolismo. 

O presente trabalho tem como objetivo a seleção e caracterização metabólica e genética das 

melhores estirpes degradadoras presentes na coleção Biotask Bioremediation Culture, com vista à 

construção de um consórcio para degradação de HAPs, nomeadamente naftaleno, antraceno e 

fenantreno. 

Quarenta e sete estirpes microbianas provenientes de quatro experiências de evolução adaptativa 

e de vários ciclos dessas mesmas experiências tendo antraceno, fenantreno, óleo mineral e tristearina 



 

VI 

 

como única fonte de carbono e energia foram estudados. O inóculo inicial das experiências de evolução 

adaptativa foi proveniente de uma estação de tratamento de águas residuais. 

Após sete dias de crescimento das quarenta e sete estirpes tendo naftaleno, antraceno e 

fenantreno como única fonte de carbono e energia, foi realizada uma triagem das quarenta e sete estirpes 

através de uma avaliação direta e uma avaliação indireta da eficiência de degradação. Diretamente, foi 

desenvolvido e otimizado um método de quantificação por cromatografia líquida de elevada 

performance. Através da construção das curvas de calibração para naftaleno, antraceno e fenantreno foi 

possível dosear a quantidade desses poluentes presentes em amostras biológicas provenientes do 

crescimento. Indiretamente, foram realizados ensaios que permitiram concluir sobre a viabilidade 

celular através do método dos números mais prováveis dos microrganismos em estudo após os sete dias 

de crescimento. Desta triagem inicial, foi possível concluir que os melhores resultados foram obtidos 

para as estirpes provenientes do ciclo de evolução adaptativa mais recente, ou seja, foi corroborado o 

sucesso das experiências de evolução adaptativa. Surgiram também evidências da volatilidade e da 

toxicidade do naftaleno ser um fator que justifica a sua baixa concentração quantificada 

cromatograficamente e a baixa viabilidade dos microrganismos na presença deste HAP. 

Com vista a selecionar as estirpes com maior potencial degradativo foi realizada uma análise 

multivariada que integra os dados quantitativos da cromatografia líquida de elevada performance e os 

dados de viabilidade celular resultantes dos números mais prováveis. A análise em componentes 

principais permitiu escolher as estirpes que melhor se posicionavam no espaço formado pelas novas 

variáveis – componentes principais. Também esta análise permitiu observar que as estirpes pertencentes 

aos ciclos de evolução adaptativa mais recentes e que se esperam exibirem um melhor comportamento 

degradativo estavam localizadas na zona do gráfico onde seria expectável encontrar os melhores 

degradadores.  

Além das três estirpes selecionadas pela análise de componentes principais, num ensaio de 

crescimento surgiu um novo microrganismo como contaminante ambiental que foi adicionado à coleção 

já que exibia um comportamento degradativo em relação aos HAPs e dada a dificuldade em encontrar 

ao acaso microrganismos com essas caraterísticas (geralmente são isolados em locais já contaminados 

pelos poluentes), pensou-se ser interessante explorá-lo melhor e incluí-lo nos estudos futuros. 

Em seguida, os quatro microrganismos selecionados foram identificados presuntivamente 

através de sequenciação do gene bacteriano que codifica para o RNA ribossomal 16S como pertencentes 

aos géneros Pseudomonas (dois microrganismos), Acinetobacter e Paraburkholderia. 

Com o propósito de investigar o metabolismo degradativo dos HAPs por parte destas bactérias, 

foram realizados estudos de caraterização metabólica e genética.  

Em primeiro lugar, foi monitorizado durante quinze dias o crescimento destes microrganismos 

tendo naftaleno, antraceno ou fenantreno como única fonte de carbono e energia. As estirpes foram 

estudadas isoladamente e em conjunto, constituindo um consórcio bacteriano. Observou-se 

aparentemente um crescimento bifásico e a estirpe pertencente ao género Pseudomonas destacou-se, 

apresentando o melhor comportamento degradativo. O consórcio também revelou que as estirpes em 

conjunto apresentam resultados superiores do que se estiverem a crescer individualmente. 

Em segundo lugar, foi avaliada a produção de biosurfactantes como estratégia de solubilização 

destes compostos poluentes. Após uma pré-seleção com um teste qualitativo onde se observou a 

formação de uma emulsão estável em duas estirpes, foi realizado um ensaio quantitativo através da 

medição da tensão superficial. Foi possível concluir que a estirpe pertence ao género Acinetobacter 

aparentemente sintetiza algum composto com atividade surfactante. 



 

VII 

 

Em terceiro lugar, foi realizada uma pesquisa de genes que estão reportados como associados 

ao catabolismo dos PAHs através de polimerase chain reaction (PCR), tendo como alvo enzimas chave 

para o clivagem de intermediários metabólicos. Além disso, foi também monitorizado o crescimento 

tendo ftalato como única fonte de carbono e energia. Foi encontrada evidência que a estirpe pertencente 

ao género Acinetobacter possui genes que lhe permitem optar por um metabolismo aeróbio com 

clivagem orto do metabolito intermediário catecol. Quanto às estirpes pertences ao género Pseudomonas 

e ao género Paraburkholderia foi observada a presença de genes que lhe permitem seguir a via de 

degradação meta do catecol e ainda a via do gentisato. Em adição, a estirpe pertencente ao género 

Paraburkolderia revelou ser a única que claramente é capaz de crescer tendo ftalato como única fonte 

de carbono, o que indica que pode também seguir esta via degradativa. Relativamente ao outro 

microrganismo pertencente também ao género Pseudomonas não foi detetada nenhuma amplificação 

nem crescimento em ftalato. 

Em suma, pode concluir-se que o objetivo do trabalho foi atingido, tendo sido selecionadas e 

estudadas em termos metabólicos e genéticos as estirpes mais promissoras em termos de potencial de 

degradação de HAPs. Foi verificado o sucesso do crescimento das estirpes no consórcio e relevadas 

algumas características que podem explicar o seu comportamento degradativo. Mais estudos serão 

necessários para elucidar mais claramente quais as vias metabólicas do catabolismo destes compostos e 

consequentemente ter acesso ao máximo do seu potencial de degradação, com vista à construção de um 

consórcio eficaz para a biorremediação de locais contaminados.

CHAPTER I – Introduction 
 

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic molecules composed only by carbon and 

hydrogen atoms. Structurally, they have a core formed by two or more fused benzene rings with a linear, 

angular or clustered geometry and a pair of carbon atoms shared between these aromatic rings (Parab 

and Phadke, 2017). These compounds are categorized as low-molecular weight if they comprise up to 

three fused aromatic rings or high-molecular weight if containing more than three aromatic rings (Cravo-

Laureau, 2017). 

 PAHs are considered ubiquitous since they can be found in water, soil and atmosphere, being 

environmentally persistent with numerous different structures and varied toxicity. These compounds are 

present in priority pollution list of European Union (EU), EU Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) and 

the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) because they are considered 

environmental pollutants which cause deleterious effects on flora and fauna of contaminated sites 

(USEPA, 2008). In addition, PAHs can cause health problems and genetic defects in human beings, 

having been reported mutagenic and carcinogenic effects (Armstrong et al., 2004). The mechanism of 

toxicity is related to interferences with cellular membrane function as well as with enzyme machinery 

(Abdel-Shafy and Mansour, 2016). 

 PAHs can be formed naturally through biological processes of natural petroleum formation as 

products of incomplete combustion from natural combustion sources such as forest fires or volcanic 

eruptions. However, the major source is anthropogenic with incomplete combustion in incinerators and 

industrial processes being a large point source. Other anthropogenic sources are automotive emissions, 

cigar smoke, barbecues, petroleum product spills and sewage sludge, among others (Abdel-Shafy and 

Mansour, 2016). 

 

1.1 Bioremediation 

 

PAHs are difficult to remove from nature. Until recently, to eliminate these pollutants 

physicochemical treatments (steam distillation, solidification, chemical precipitation and incineration) 

have been implemented. However, besides being more expensive and generate toxic sub products that 

require additional treatment, the methods described tend to transport contaminant compounds from one 

place to another rather than really eliminate them (Blanco-Enríquez et al., 2018). 

 Bioremediation is an approach to convert the toxic compounds to less hazardous/non-hazardous 

forms with less input of chemicals, energy and time. This is a process to remove pollutants in an eco-

friendly manner and have low cost operation costs. PAH-contaminated sites can be remediated via 

individual microorganisms – algae, bacteria and fungi - or in combination – microbial consortia (Waigi 

et al., 2015). Bacterial genera that are known to degrade PAHs are present in Appendix A (Seo et al., 

2009). Employing microbial consortia leads to large-scale production since pure cultures are not often 

economically practicable due to high production costs, substrates and biomass recovery. In addition, 

microorganisms are rarely isolated as pure cultures but are naturally part of consortia in contaminated 

sites (Blanco-Enríquez et al., 2018). 

 In wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), the biodegradation of pollutants by taking advantage 

of microorganisms present in activated sludge is one of the most important strategies to remove organic 



 

2 

 

contaminants from wastewater. Nevertheless, this approach has limitations since many contaminants are 

not efficiently eliminated. To counterweight the limitations, the concept of bioaugmentation has 

emerged by the introduction of specific and efficient pollutant-degrading microorganisms (natural or 

genetically engineered) into a microbial community to enhance their hydrocarbon-oxidizing potential 

(Nzila et al., 2016).  

 

1.2 Bacterial metabolism of PAHs  
 

  A wide variety of bacterial, fungal and algal species have the potential to degrade PAHs. 

However, this introduction will only focus on the bacterial metabolism of PAHs degradation. 

1.2.1 Aerobic degradation  

 The initial step in the metabolic aerobic degradation process of PAHs involve their chemo-, 

regio- and stereospecific hydroxylation by dioxygenases, which catalyse the incorporation of two 

oxygen atoms from molecular oxygen into the aromatic ring. From this reaction, cis-dihydrodiols are 

formed and targeted by dehydrogenases to form a limited number of central aromatic acid intermediates, 

such as the monoaromatic compounds o-phthalate, salicylate and gentisate. The aromatic ring of the 

oxyfunctionalized metabolites produced is then cleaved at the ortho or meta position by ring cleaving 

dioxygenases such as C-C breaking oxygenases, yielding intermediates which can enter in central 

metabolic routes for example the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) or the ?-oxidation cycle (Ghosal et al., 

2016) (Bruno and Schmid, 2004). 

 The degradation scheme described (Figure 1) is called “metabolic funnel” because it suggests 

that microorganisms increased the range of substrates by developing highly diverse upper pathways 

including enzymes with large substrate spectra able to turn a variety of initial substrates into one of the 

central metabolites. The oxygenases involved in the metabolism of PAHs belong to different families 

of enzymes and are distinguished by the type of reaction they catalyse, in particular the range of 

substrates they can transform (Ghosal et al., 2016). The location and geometry of the active site are 

critical in enzyme specificity because they influence substrate access and orientation. Depending on this 

selectivity, different dihydrodiols are formed, which determines the subsequent steps of the degradation 

pathway (Ferraro et al., 2006). Consequently, this variability contribute to the flexibility of the microbial 

machinery for degrading PAHs (Bruno and Schmid, 2004).

The Rieske non-heme iron dioxygenase called ring hidroxylating dioxygenase (RHD) (Bugg 

and Ramaswamy, 2008) is the essential enzyme for initiating PAH catabolism by ring hydroxylation. It 

consists of a nicotinamide adenine nucleotide (NADH) reductase, a ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] and a terminal 

oxygenase. This last component is formed by a larger ?-subunit with the iron-sulfur proteins (ISP), with 

Fe (II) as cofactor in the active centre of the enzyme which confers the designation of extradiol 

dioxygenase (Lipscomb, 2009) and a smaller ?-subunit with structural functions. The reductase and 

ferredoxin transport electrons to the ?-subunit, which inserts molecular oxygen into the substrate to give 

cis-dihydrodiols, which are subsequently transformed to diols by a dehydrogenase (Cravo-Laureau, 

2017) (Figure 2). 

  

 

 

 

 

 

PAH-RDHs are largely distributed enzymes across microbial taxa and comparisons of 

similarities in amino acid sequence have revealed distinct PAH-RDH families, the phylogenies of which 

generally follow those of the host (see Appendix B). Proteobacterial RDH are generally most active with 

low molecular weight PAHs such as naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene than actinobacterial 

RDH (Cravo-Laureau, 2017). The variability in gene clusters and the promiscuity of the enzymes 

involved in PAHs catabolism provide microorganisms with the capacity to degrade a great range of 

compounds. 

 

 
1.2.2 Anaerobic degradation  

In the absence of oxygen, it is known that naphthalene and two-ring PAHs can be used as the 

sole carbon source of carbon and energy. Whether three or more ring PAHs are used as growth substrate 

or co-metabolized in anaerobic condition remains unclear (Meckenstock et al., 2004). 

It was reported the success of sulfate-reducing naphthalene-degrading cultures from different 

PAHs contaminated anoxic aquifers, pointing that the capacity to degrade naphthalene anaerobically 

with sulfate as terminal electron acceptor is widespread in nature (Kümmel et al., 2015). Other studies 

indicate that anaerobic PAH-degradation can also be performed by iron-reducing microorganisms 

(Kleemann and Meckenstock, 2011). There were also reports on degradation of PAHs with nitrate as 

electron acceptor but it has been difficult to reproduced them (Eriksson et al., 2003).

1.3 Microbial uptake of PAHs 
 

The bioavailability of the pollutants is influenced by polarity, hydrophobicity and water 

solubility. As PAHs are hydrophobic and practically insoluble in water and present high octanol-water 

partition coefficient they remain adsorbed in the non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL). Besides that, PAHs 

strongly bind to soil and sediment organic matter. However, since the degradative enzymes essential for 

the metabolism of PAHs have an intracellular location, they must be solubilized so that they can enter 

the cytoplasm and be metabolized. Two strategies can be implemented to enable the access of 

microorganisms to the compounds and consequently their biodegradation: either the target compound is 

dissolved in the aqueous phase or the microorganism adheres directly to the NAPL (Schluep et al., 

2001).. 

PAH’s properties limit their bioavailability and thus the effectiveness of a bioremediation 

process. Driven by the solubilization capacity of surfactants - synthetic and natural - for hydrophobic 

compounds, surfactant-mediated remediation has been a research focus in recent years (Makkar and 

Rockne, 2003; Li and Chen, 2009)  

A surfactant is an amphiphilic molecule composed of a hydrophilic group and a hydrophobic 

group that can accumulate at the liquid-liquid interfaces and reduce both surface tension and interfacial 

tension. In addition, surfactants increase the solubility, mobility, bioavailability and subsequent 

biodegradation of hydrophobic or insoluble organic compounds, such as PAHs. When the surfactant 

concentration exceeds a certain level, called critical micellar concentration (CMC), the molecules 

aggregate and micelles are formed. In this condition, hydrophobic molecules, depending on their 

polarity, are incorporated into the micelle core or the micelle/water interface, and their solubilization 

occurs (Li and Chen, 2009).  

Surfactants can enhance bioremediation in three ways (Figure 3). First, the microorganism can 

take up the pollutant from the direct interaction of the micelle with cell membrane. Second, 

microorganisms use only the pollutant molecules that are dissolved in the aqueous phase and the role of 

the surfactant is thereby to increase the mass transfer from NAPL to aqueous phase. Third, the presence 

of surfactants changes cell hydrophobicity, facilitating the direct contact with cells (Schippers et al., 

2000).

et al., 2000).

Possibly, a more promising answer for bioavailability enhancement may be the use of 

surfactants produced naturally by microorganisms – biosurfactants - whose primary function is to 

facilitate microbial life in hydrophilic-hydrophobic environments.  Over the last years, interest in 

biosurfactants increased due to their several advantages over their synthetic counterparts. For example, 

biosurfactants are easily biodegradable and consequently pose no extra pollution threat. In addition, 

most studies indicate that they are not toxic to microorganisms and therefore not likely to inhibit 

biodegradation of PAHs. Biosurfactant production is also potentially more cost-effective than synthetic 

surfactants and can be easily achieved in situ at contaminated sites using inexpensive raw materials. In 

contrast, synthetic surfactants can be toxic, be degraded instead of the pollutant and their production is 

expensive since they derived only from synthetic stocks, which make the remediation difficult to achieve 

on site (Makkar and Rockne, 2003). 

Biosurfactants can be classified based on their compound structure as glycolipids, lipopeptides 

and lipoprotein, fatty acids, phospholipids and neutral lipids, polymeric surfactants and particulate 

biosurfactant (Shekhar et al., 2015). Detailed information about the microorganism and associated 

biosurfactant are present in Appendix C. 

Since PAHs exhibit low solubility in water and a high octanol-water partition coefficient, they 

tend to partition in cell wall structures generally through passive transport driven by the concentration 

gradient between the environment and the cell.  The bilayer of phospholipids that constitutes bacterial 

membranes creates a hydrophobic region in the interior of the membrane that can act as a reservoir for 

accumulation of hydrophobic compounds (Bugg et al., 2000). Thus, both the concentration of the 

pollutant and its bioavailability are crucial for the transport process. The higher the concentration and 

bioavailability of PAHs, the greater is their transport to the cell, always considering the saturation limit 

of the transporters. On one side, microorganisms can use this passive diffusion to reach rapid 

degradation of PAHs, with consequent growth. On the other side, the rapid accumulation of PAHs may 

lead to cell membrane disruption or inhibition of the membrane proteins etc., causing cell 

death.(Sikkema et al., 1995) When PAHs concentration and bioavailability is low, the transport may not 

occur, decreasing the efficiency of microbial degradation and therefore the bioremediation process. 

However, some microorganisms seem to have adapted to that conditions and exhibit mechanisms such 

as direct contact with solid-phase PAHs and biosurfactant excretion to facilitate desorption and 

solubilization (as referred earlier) (Schluep et al., 2001).  

Some studies have shown the presence of an active efflux mechanism of phenanthrene, 

fluoranthene and anthracene in Pseudomonas fluorescens LP6a (Bugg et al., 2000). It has also been 

proposed the involvement of a specific energy-dependent carrier for the incorporation of naphthalene 

into Pseudomonas fluorescens Uper-1 (Whitman, 1998). In Mycobacterium sp. strain RJGII-135 was 

suggested the existence of passive and active transport for the use of phenanthrene (Miyata et al., 2004). 

Although limited research has been performed on cellular binding and transport of PAHs, several 

experiments suggest that passive and active transport systems can be exploited to increase the efficiency 

of bioremediation.

1.4 Genes associated with catabolism of PAHs 
 

nah-like genes  
 Genetically, naphthalene catabolism has been extensively studied using the Pseudomonas 

putida G7 strain as a model, since a transmissible metabolic plasmid that carries genetic information 

enabling its host to use naphthalene as a sole source of carbon and energy was isolated (Early, 1973). In 

NAH7 plasmid, naphthalene oxidation genes are organized in two operons: the upper catabolic pathway 

operon includes genes nahABCDEF encoding the enzymes involved in the conversion of naphthalene 

to salicylate and the lower catabolic pathway operon includes genes nahGHIJK, coding the enzymes 

involved in the salicylate to TCA cycle intermediates pyruvate and acetaldehyde via catechol meta-

cleavage pathway. It is implied that the enzymes required for the catechol ortho cleavage pathway 

originating the TCA cycle intermediates succinyl CoA and acetyl CoA are encoded in genes located on 

the chromosome (Yent and Gunsalus, 1985). Both upper (nah) and lower (sal) catabolic pathway 

operons are regulated by a trans-acting positive control regulator coded by the nahR gene, located 

between the two operons (Schell, 1985). The nahR gene encodes a LysR-type transcriptional repressor-

activator that binds to promoters upstream of both the upper and lower catabolic pathway operons and 

represses transcription allowing only a basal level of expression. Binding of salicylate to NahR at the 

promoters induces a conformational change in DNA-bound NahR that enables transcription to occur 

(Cravo-Laureau, 2017). This regulatory protein is needed for the high-level expression of the nah genes 

(Habe and Omori, 2003). 

 Nucleotide sequences of genes encoding naphthalene upper-catabolic enzymes from several 

Pseudomonas spp. strains were described. These genes were named according to the strains’s feature of 

substrate use: nah for naphthalene degradation from P. putida strain G7 and P. stutzeri strain AN10 

(Simon et al., 1993; Moore, Bosch and Garc?, 1999), ndo for naphthalene dioxygenation from P. putida 

strain NCIB9816 (Palva and Teeri, 1988) (equivalent to nah), dox for dibenzothiophene oxidation from 

Pseudomonas sp. strain C18 (Denome et al., 1993), and pah for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 

(phenanthrene) degradation from P. putida strain OUS82 and P. aeruginosa strain PaK1 (Wang and 

Road, 1999) (later, all of these strains were found to grow on naphthalene). The gene organization and 

sequence similarity (about 90%) among the upper catabolic pathways genes of these strains were similar 

to those of the nah genes from the NAH7 plasmid of strain G7. Consequently, these genes are called 

“classical nah-like genes”. In the upper catabolic pathway, the genes coding for NDO ferredoxin 

reductase (nahAa), NDO ferredoxin (nahAb), the a subunit of NDO (nahAc), the b subunit of NDO 

(nahAd), naphthalene cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (nahB), salicylaldehyde dehydrogenase (nahF), 

1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase (nahC), an unknown ORF (nahQ), trans-

ohydroxybenzylidenepyruvate hydratase-aldolase (nahE), and 2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylate 

isomerase (nahD), are arranged in this order (nahAaAbAcAdBFCQED) (Habe and Omori, 2003). 

 For the lower catabolic pathway, the reported genes are present on Pseudomonas stutzeri strain 

AN10 and encode the salicylate hydroxylase (nahG), chloroplast ferredoxin-like protein (nahT), 

catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (nahH), hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (nahI), 

hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase (nahN ), 2-oxopent-4-enoate hydratase (nahL), acetaldehyde 

dehydrogenase (nahO), 2-oxo-4-hydroxypentanoate aldolase (nahM), 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase 

(nahK ), and 4-oxalocrotonate isomerase (nahJ), being arranged in this order (nahGTHINLOMKJ ) 

(Moore et al.,  2000).

phd genes  
 Comamonas teststeroni strains (GZ38A, GZ39 and GZ42) were isolated from river sediment 

and exhibited the ability to grow on naphthalene as well as phenanthrene except for strain GZ38A which 

grows on phenanthrene and anthracene. The catabolic genes present on the three strains had no genetic 

relatedness to the nah-like genes from P. putida strain NCIB 9816-4 discussed above (Zylstra, 1996). 

In strain GZ39, the genes responsible for the initial conversion of naphthalene and phenanthrene were 

named phd genes. The results indicated that the genes for phenanthrene degradation in strain GZ38A 

are similar (but not identical) to those from strain GZ39, but that strain GZ42 did not have any genes 

similar to the phd genes from strain GZ39. This make evident that these C. testosteroni strains represent 

at least two new classes of genes involved in PAH degradation. It also indicates that at least three non-

homologous families of genes responsible for phenanthrene degradation can be found in the same 

environmental sample (Zylstra, 1996; Zylstra, 1997) 

 In strain GZ39, the genes coding for ferredoxin (phdAb), ferredoxin reductase (phdAa), cis-

dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (phdB), the ? subunit of ISP (phdAc), the b subunit of ISP (phdAd), 

isomerase (phdD), an unknown ORF, glutathione-S-transferase, and hydratase-aldolase (phdE) were 

arranged in this order (phdAbAaBAcAdDE). This gene organization was relatively diferent from that of 

the nah-like genes, and several genes such as extradiol dioxygenase (nahC analogue) were not within 

the cluster (Zylstra, 1997) The phd genes were compared to genes known from PAH catabolism and the 

? subunit sequence of ISP (PhdAc) was found to fit within the naphthalene family of dioxygenases 

although they are not closely related. In contrast, the sequences of the ? subunit  of ISP (PhdAd) and 

ferredoxin (PhdAb) showed little similarity to proteins having the same function in other aromatic ring 

dioxygenases (Habe and Omori, 2003). 

 It is important to mention that although strain GZ42 has novel genes for phenanthrene 

degradation, they are divergent relatives of those found in P. putida NCIB 9816. However, the 

nucleotide structure of the genes reveals some very important differences between the two strains. For 

example, the amino acid sequences of the enzymes are much closely related than the nucleotide sequence 

of each analogous gene, revealing genetic drift with conservation of enzyme structure. More significant 

is the evidence that, although the gene order in strain GZ42 is identical to P. putida NCIB 9816, there 

are two new genes between the genes encoding ferredoxin reductase (nahAa) and ferredoxin (nahAb). 

These genes were designated nahAc2 and nahAd2 because they were very similar to those of the ? and 

? subunits, respectively, of another aromatic-ring dioxygenases ISP (Zylstra, 1997). But these genes 

have been thought to be non-functional in strain GZ42 (Habe and Omori, 2003). 

 

nag genes  
A naphthalene catabolic operon with the same gene organization and similarity to the nah 

operon of the C. testeroni strain GZ42 was found in Ralstonia sp. strain U2 and characterized. The 

naphthalene dioxygenase genes (nag genes) coding for ferredoxin reductase (nagAa), ferredoxin 

(nagAb), the a subunit of ISP (nagAc), the b subunit of ISP (nagAd), cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase 

(nagB), and aldehyde dehydrogenase (nagF ) were arranged in this order and two open reading frames 

named nagG and nagH (analogous to nahAc2 and nahAd2 of strain GZ42) were inserted between nagAa 

and nagAb. The nagG product aligns with the ? subunit of other aromatic-ring dioxygenases, but the 

nagH product exhibited  limited homology with the ? subunit of other aromatic-ring dioxygenases. It 

was suggested that the hydroxylation of salicylate occurs through NagGH acting as a monooxygenase, 

with an associated electron transport chain composed by a ferredoxin and a ferredoxin redutase 

providing the electrons from a reduced nicotinamide cofactor, like NAD or NADP. This electron 



 

9 

 

transport chain for salicylate 5-hydroxylase is probably formed by NagAa and NagAb given the 

proximity between the genes coding for these proteins (nagAa and nagAb) and the nagG and nagH genes 

(Fuenmayor et al., 1998). The genes for conversion of naphthalene to gentisate 

(nagAaGHAbAcAdBFCQED) are ordered in the same way as the genes in the classic nah-like operon 

of Pseudomonas spp. strains, with the exeption of the nagGH insertion. Furthermore, there is another 

difference between the nag operon and nah operon which is related to the regulatory gene nagR being 

located upstream the genes of upper catabolic pathway whereas its analogue nahR is located downstream 

(Zhou et al., 2001). 

 

 Another gene cluster (nagJIKLMN) was found and the nagI, nagK, and nagL genes encoded the 

enzymes involved in the further catabolism of gentisate to fumarate-pyruvate: gentisate 1,2-

dioxygenase, fumarylpyruvate hydrolase, and maleylpyruvate isomerase, respectively (Zhou et al., 

2001). 

 Nucleotide sequence comparisons suggest that the novel gene order nagAa-nagG-nagH-nagAb-

nagAc-nagAd-nagB-nagF represents the model for naphthalene strains (like U2 and GZ42) that 

metabolize salicylate through the gentisate pathway instead of the catechol meta cleavage pathway 

(Fuenmayor et al., 1998). 

 

phn genes  
 A divergent set of PAH catabolic genes named phn genes were described and these genes can 

be divided in two families, who are significantly different in sequence and gene order from the other 

classic genes involved in PAH degradation. For example, phn-like genes, although isofunctional, have 

little homology with the nah-like genes (Laurie and Zealand, 1999). The PhnAcAFK2 family was first 

identified in Alcaligenes faecalis AFK2 and the Phn term is used to indicate that microorganisms with 

this genotype are characteristically limited to phenanthrene as sole carbon and energy source to support 

growth. The ring hydroxylating dioxygenase encoded in these genes leads to the formation of phthalate 

as an central intermediate. Although the name bears some resemblance, the PhnAcRP007 genotype 

identified in Burkholderia sp. strain RP007 differs from the PhnAcAFK2 family because it allows the 

utilization of naphthalene and phenanthrene to support growth and it leads to the production of salicylate 

from the upper pathway rather than phthalate (Cravo-Laureau, 2017). 

 Regarding Alcaligenes faecalis strain AFK2, the phn genes have a novel operon structure, and 

the genes coding for ferredoxin (phnAb), ferredoxin reductase (phnAa), cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase 

(phnB), the ? subunit of NDO (phnAc), the ? subunit of NDO (phnAd), putative 2-hydroxychromene-2-

carboxylate isomerase (phnD), glutathione-S-transferase (gst), trans-2-carboxybenzalpyruvate 

hydratase-aldolase (phnH), 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate dioxygenase (phnG),2-carboxybenzaldehyde 

dehydrogenase (phnI), 3,4-dihydroxyphenanthrene dioxygenase (phnC)), 1-hydroxy-2-

naphthoaldehyde dehydrogenase (phnF), and putative transo-hydroxy  benzylidenepyruvate hydratase-

aldolase (phnE) are arranged in this order (phnAbAaBAcAdDHGICFE) (Kiyohara et al., 1982) 

 

  Also, Burkholderia sp. strain RP007 presents a phn operon distinct from those reported so far. 

The naphthalene and phenanthrene can be degraded through a common upper pathway via salicylate 

(Habe and Omori, 2003). pathway These phn genes encode regulatory proteins (phnR and phnS), 

aldehyde dehydrogenase (phnF), hydratase-aldolase (phnE), extradiol dioxygenase (phnC), isomerase 

(phnD), ISP ? subunit of initial dioxygenase (phnAc), ISP ? subunit of initial dioxygenase (phnAd), 

dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (phnB), arranged in this order (phnRSFECDAcAdB). Some particularities 

are noted, such as the fact that the locus has ISP ? and ? subunits of PAH-initial dioxygenase (phnAcAd) 



 

10 

 

but lacks both the ferredoxin and reductase components.  In addition, the phnB gene encoding cis-diol 

dehydrogenase is more closely related to the corresponding genes from biphenyl catabolic pathways 

than to those found in the classical nahB-like genes. Furthermore, phnC gene encodes a novel extradiol 

dioxygenase with phylogenetic relationships with known PAH and biphenyl dioxygenases (Laurie and 

Zealand, 1999). Also two catechol 2,3-dioxygenase genes involved in the lower pathways (meta-

cleavage yielding acethaldeyde and piruvate) were characterized (Laurie and Lloyd-jones, 1999).  

Upstream of the phn catabolic genes, there are two putative regulatory genes, phnR and phnS, being 

PhnS a LysR-type transcriptional activator and PhnR is a member of the s54-dependent family of 

positive transcriptional regulators (Laurie and Zealand, 1999). 

 

bph genes  
  Sphingomonads (composed of Sphingomonas, Sphingobium, Sphingopyxis and 

Novosphingobium genera) are capable of degrading PAHs like naphthalene, phenanthrene and 

anthracene by complete mineralization via similar pathways and enzymes found in other Gram-negative 

bacteria (Waigi et al., 2015). It was identified and characterized the complete sequence of a catabolic 

plasmid named pNL1 from Novosphingobium aromaticivorans strain F199 (Romine et al., 1999). This 

nucleotide sequence revealed a complex arrangement of genes for catabolism of all PAHs that are 

metabolized by the strain, wherein at least 13 gene clusters were predicted to encode enzymes associated 

with degradation of these compounds. Genes associated with degradation of naphthalene and byphenyl 

to catechol are predicted to take place in at least six different gene clusters. Seven different three-

component oxygenases are expected from sequence analysis and seemed to interact with only one set of 

ferredoxin and reductase components in pNL1, acting as the only electron transport system for multiple 

dioxygenases (Romine, Fredrickson and Li, 1999). Only single copies of bphA3 and bphA4, coding for 

ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase, have been detected in strain F199. The bphA1f gene in strain F199 

is likely to encode the ? subunit of the naphthalene initial dioxygenase, even though its enzymatic 

activity has not been confirmed. In addition, it was verified the presence of at least six bphA1 and bphA2 

dioxygenase gene homologs spread throughout the plasmid. These dioxygenases may be associated with 

upper pathways generating either salicylate or phthalate (Waigi et al., 2015). Therefore, the key 

adaptation of most PAH-degrading sphingomonad strains is the multiple genes encoding catabolically 

versatile enzymes, specifically dioxygenases that can degrade different PAHs. 

  The gene organization and regulation of degradative pathways in sphingomonads are very 

complex comparatively to non-sphingomonads (such as pseudomonads), which reveals an evolutionary 

deviation. This adaptability mechanism is named “flexible” gene organization (i.e. different 

combinations of conserved gene clusters), which benefits in quick and efficient adjustment to new 

compounds in contaminated sites (Basta et al., 2017). 

 

nar genes 

 A novel catalytic component of a naphthalene dioxygenase composed by a Rieske [2Fe-2S] 

centre was reported from Rhodococcus sp. strain NCBIMB12038 which is capable of utilizing 

naphthalene as its exclusive carbon and energy source. The nucleotide sequences of narAa and narAb 

genes encode the ? and ? subunits of ISP, respectively. However, these genes are not homologous to 

their previously characterized counterparts in Pseudomonas (Larkin et al., 1999). It was also described 

a narB gene coding for cis-naphthalene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase. Once again this nucleotide sequence 

shows low overall similarity with nahB from P. putida strain G7 (Kulakov et al., 2000). Nonetheless, 

the organization of naphthalene catabolic genes in strain NCIMV12038 (narAaAbB) is identical to the 

nah genes from Pseudomonas species (Habe and Omori, 2003). This dioxygenase coded by the nar 



 

11 

 

genes are generally associated with upper pathways that lead to phthalate formation (Cravo-Laureau, 

2017). 

 

 

phd genes 

 The phd genes of Nocardioides sp. strain KP7 are the most studied PAH-catabolic genes in 

Gram-positive bacteria, and belong to a new class of PAH-catabolic genes because of differences in 

gene organization and sequence similarity (Habe and Omori, 2003). This strain is able to grow on 

phenanthrene (but not on naphthalene) and the degradation occurs via the phthalate pathway. The genes 

responsible for degradation of phenanthrene to phthalate (phd) are located on the chromosome. The 

phdA, phdB, phdC and phdD genes, which encode the ? and ? subunits of the oxygenase component, a 

ferredoxin, and a ferredoxin reductase, respectively, of phenanthrene dioxygenase were identified. Both 

subunits showed low sequence identity to the ? and ? subunits of other aromatic ring dioxygenases. 

Relatively to phdC gene, it codes for a ferredoxin which presents more similarity to the [3Fe-4S] or 

[4Fe-4S] type of ferredoxin, but not to the [2Fe-2S] type of ferredoxin found in most PAH dioxygenases. 

Contrarily, the ferredoxin reductase coded by phdD shows moderate sequence identity to the ferredoxin 

reductase of other isofunctional enzymes. All three components (PhdABCD) are indispensable for the 

effective dioxygenase activity that converts phenanthrene to his cis-diol compound (Harayama, 2000). 

There are other genes in the cluster (phdEFABGHCD) encoding enzymes responsible for the 

transformation of phenanthrene to 1-hydroxy-2-naphthanoate, such as  dihydridiol dehydrogenase 

(phdE), extradiol dioxygenase (phdF), hydratase-aldolase (phdG) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (phdH). 

This gene cluster did not contain the ORF encoding isomerase, found in all PAH catabolic genes from 

Gram-negative bacteria. In adition, the catabolic genes for the conversion of 1-hydroxy-2-naphthanoate 

to phthalate encode 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate dioxygenase (phdI), trans-2’-carboxybenzalpyruvate 

hydratase-aldolase (phdJ), and 2-carboxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase (phdK) (Habe and Omori, 2003). 

 

1.5 Objectives 
 

 Focusing on the negative impact of PAHs in environment and human health and in the context 

of a current research project of Lab Bugworkers|M&amp;amp;B-BioISI with Biotask Company, adaptive 

evolution experiments using microbial consortia from activated sludge and PAHs as selection pressure 

have previously been set up to obtain more efficient strains that can be used as novel bioaugmentation 

inocula, leading to a culture collection with over 300 microorganisms. 

The goal of this MSc thesis is to select, identify and characterize at metabolic and genetic levels 

the best PAHs degraders in a sub-set of 47 evolved strains from this previous work in order to develop 

a novel bioaugmentation consortium.

CHAPTER II - Materials and Methods 
 

2.1 Microbial strains 
 

The strains used in this work belong to the Biotask Bioremediation Culture Collection (BBC) 

and have been isolated from adaptive evolution (AE) experiments carried by Pedro Teixeira, in the scope 

of his PhD thesis. 

The adaptive evolution experiments were performed in mineral culture medium with the 

recalcitrant compounds anthracene (ANT), phenanthrene (PHE), glyceryl tristearate (GTS) and mineral 

oil (MiO) as sole carbon source for selective pressure. A WWTP sample was used as initial inoculum 

and kept for over 50 cycles, each consisting of a 7-day incubation with continuous shaking and addition 

of 1% inoculum from previous cycle. At different AE cycles along the experiments, aliquots were plated 

in different solid medium (Figure 4) and morphologically distinct types of colonies were isolated as pure 

cultures and genomically characterized by M13 PCR-fingerprinting (P. Teixeira, personal 

communication).

2.2 PAH-degradation experiments 

 

PAH-degradation experiments were carried out using glass tubes with screw stopper (Duran) 

containing 5 mL of M9 mineral medium (see composition in Appendix E) and PAHs were added with 

a final concentration of 2000 mg/L as sole carbon and energy source. The PAHs used in this test were 

naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene (Sigma Aldrich), studied separately. The inoculum was 

prepared by growing each of the 47 strains in TSA at 28°C overnight. Subsequently, the cells were 

recollected to a 0.8% sodium chloride (NaCl) solution. The optical density of cells was adjusted by using 

a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Unicam) at 600 nm to OD of 0.01 (1 unit of absorbance corresponds 

to 108 bacterial cells.ml-1 and 107 yeast cells.ml-1) (software Vision). The cell inoculum corresponding 

to 8 ×106 cells.ml-1 was added to each glass tube. The culture was shaken and incubated under aerobic 

conditions in a shaker (Thermo Scientific) at 28°C and at a speed of 150 rpm during 7 days. Abiotic 

control was performed by adding PAH into M9 without inoculum. After 7 days, the remaining PAH 

concentration was analysed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. The assay 

was performed in duplicate. 

Optimization tests were performed in order to define the concentration parameters of the 

calibration standards, considering that HPLC’s quantification and detection limits are different for each 

compound. The range of an analytical procedure is the interval between the upper and lower 

concentration of analyte in the sample (these concentrations included) for which has been demonstrated 

that the analytical procedure has a suitable level of precision, accuracy and linearity. For naphthalene, 

the standard concentrations (ng/?L) used were 10.0, 50.0, 100.0, 200.0, 300.0 and 400.0. For anthracene, 

the standard concentrations (ng/?L) used were 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5, 15.0 and 20.0. For 

phenanthrene, the standard concentrations (ng/?L) used were 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5, 15.0 and 20.0. 

 

2.3 Extraction and quantification of PAHs 

 

 After a liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) with 5 mL of chloroform (Carlo Erba) and manual 

agitation, the residual PAHs were analysed by HPLC (Beckman Coulter) with C18 reverse phase (5 ?m 

particle size, Length × Internal Diameter: 25 cm × 4.6 mm, Supelco) column under gradient condition 

using acetonitrile (Carlo Erba): water (40:60) (v/v) as mobile phase for 5 minutes and then with linear 

increase of acetonitrile (100:0) (v/v) for 25 minutes. A fluorescence detector (Jasco FP-2020 Plus) 

equipped with a data acquisition system (32 Karat) were used at 280 nm for excitation wavelength and 

355 nm for emission wavelength. The system operating pressure and flow rate were 2000-3000 psi and 

1.0 mL/ min, respectively.  

In order to validate the HPLC method for quantification of PAHs, the following parameters 

were taken in account. 

 (i) S electivity /Sp ecif icity 

Specificity is the capacity of an analytical method to separate and quantify the analyte in the 

presence of other compounds in the sample like impurities, degradants or matrix. It’s an important 

parameter in a quantification assay because it should provide an exact result that allows an accurate 

statement on the content of the analyte in a sample (ICH, 2005). 



 

15 

 

In liquid chromatography, selectivity is achieved by choosing optimal columns and setting 

chromatographic conditions (mobile phase composition, column temperature and detector wavelength). 

To provide unique selectivity for PAH’s separation, reversed-phase liquid chromatography on 

chemically bonded C18 phases was used (Wise et al., 1981).  In addition, the specificity of the method 

was determined by analysing a sample containing all the three PAHs – naphthalene, anthracene and 

phenanthrene - under study, and a good resolution between two peaks (retention times) without overlaps 

was observed. 

For chromatographic procedures, representative chromatograms should be presented to 

demonstrate specificity and individual components should be appropriately labelled (see Appendix F). 

 

(ii) A ccu ra cy 

 The accuracy of an analytical method expresses the closeness of agreement between an accepted 

reference value and the value found (ICH, 2005). 

 

(iii) P recision 

 The precision of an analytical method expresses the closeness of agreement between a series of 

measurements obtained from multiple sampling of the same homogeneous sample under the prescribed 

conditions (ICH, 2005). 

 

(iv) L imit of d etection  

The detection limit of an individual analytical method is defined as the lowest amount of analyte 

in a sample which can be detected but not necessarily quantitated as an exact value (Shrivastava and 

Gupta, 2011). It is calculated based on standard deviation of response (?) and slope (s) expressed as: 

LOD = 
3.3?

?
 

The slope may be estimated from the calibration curve. The standard deviation is calculated 

through the standard deviation of y-intercepts of regression lines.  

 

(v) L imit of qua n tif ica tion  

 The quantification limit of an individual analytical method is as the lowest amount of analyte in 

a sample which can be quantitatively determined with suitable precision and accuracy value (Shrivastava 

and Gupta, 2011).  It is calculated based on standard deviation of response (?) and slope (s) expressed 

as: 

LOQ = 
10?

?
 

The slope may be estimated from the calibration curve. The standard deviation is calculated 

through the standard deviation of y-intercepts of regression lines.  

 

 

 



 

16 

 

(vi) C a lib ra tion  ran g e and  lin ea rity  

For quantification by HPLC, a good calibration is essential to ensure reliable results and it 

requires a serie of standards of increasing concentration in order to create a calibration curve. The 

linearity of an analytical procedure is the capacity (within a given range) to obtain test results which are 

directly proportional to the concentration of analyte present in the sample. 

 

2.4 Microbial cell viability 

 

Assessment of the most probable number (MPN) of viable microbial cells was performed in 96 

microwell plates, using 290 µL of tryptic soy broth (TSB) (Sigma Aldrich), 10 µL of inoculum from 

each 10-fold serial dilution (1 mL final volume). Incubation was performed at 28 °C for 48h. 

For determination of characteristic number of microorganisms capable of PAHs degradation, 

two criteria were used. The positive wells criteria consist of using the number of positive wells (wells 

that shows turbidity resulting from growth) in the least concentrated dilution in which all or the highest 

number of wells were growth-positive and the numbers of the growth-positive wells in the following 

two higher dilutions were used. The negative wells criterion was also used (no growth is observed) 

where the lowest dilution where all the wells are negative and the numbers corresponding to the positive 

wells of the next two more concentrated dilutions are considered. The characteristic number obtained is 

then multiplied by the dilution factor in order to obtain the MPN values, based on 10-fold dilutions and 

3 wells per dilution (n=3), were derived from published McCrady statistical tables (Marques-Pinto and 

Galhardo, 1983).  

 

2.5 Principal component analysis 

 

The results from the HPLC quantification and MPN determination were gathered in a matrix in 

order to perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using NTSYSpc 2.2 software. The quantitative 

data was standardized by subtracting the average and dividing by the standard deviation. The similarity 

was calculated applying Pearson’s correlation coefficient to the standardized matrix. Analysis of the 

explanatory variables for PCs can be found in Appendix G and H. 

 

 

2.6 Molecular identification of strains 

 

Amplification of 16S rRNA gene was performed in a final volume of 50 ?l with 1x PCR reaction 

buffer (Invitrogen), 2 mM MgCl2, 50 pmol of each primer PA (5’AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCT CAG3’) 

(Massol-Deya et al., 1995) and 1392R (5’ACGGGCGGTGTGTRC3’) (Baker et al., 2003), 0.2 mM of 

dNTP’s mix, 1 U of Taq polymerase and 1 ?l of template DNA. 



 

17 

 

Amplifications reactions were performed in a UNO II Thermal Cycler (Biometra, Germany), 

with the following conditions: 3 minutes of initial denaturation at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 1 

minute of denaturation at 94°C, 1 minute of annealing at 55°C and 1 minute of extension at 72°C, and 

by a final elongation step of 3 minutes at 72°C. 

PCR products were visualized by gel electrophoresis in a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel in 0.5x TBE 

buffer (40 mM Tris; 45 mM Boric acid; 1 mM EDTA; pH 8.3) at 90V for 1h. After, the gel was stained 

in an 0.5 µg/mL ethidium bromide solution and photographed in an Alliance 4.7 UV Transilluminator 

(UVItec, Cambridge), using Alliance software version 15.15 (Uvitec, Cambridge). PCR products which 

amplified correctly were provided to Eurofins Genomics to be sequenced through Sanger sequencing. 

Results obtained were BLASTed against NCBI database to find the most probable identification. 

 

 

 2.7 Growth curves 

 

Experiment 
To evaluate the biodegradative potential of the selected PAH degrading microorganisms, 

growth curves were performed for single strains and a consortium (a combination of all isolates), using 

15 mL of M9 medium and 10 mg of one PAH in Erlenmeyer flasks. Pre-inoculum from each isolate and 

the consortium was added to a flask in order to have 9 x 106 cells/mL, using a UV-visible 

spectrophotometer (Unicam) at 600 nm for the adjustment (software Vision).  Each experiment was 

made in duplicate. The experiment was carried out in a shaking incubator (Thermo Scientific) at 28 °C 

and 160 rpm for 15 days. All flasks were capped with cotton wool and covered with aluminium foil. 

During the 15 days incubation, samples were collected aseptically for bacteria enumeration every 24 

hours for the first 5 days and every 48 hours on the remaining days. For each sample, viable bacterial 

number was determined by MPN (see section 2.4). The MPN method was validated by counting colony 

forming units (CFU). Three strains were randomly chosen to validate each one of the three PAHs and 

triplicates were made, using TSA medium and 100µL as inoculum which was spread with spheres and 

incubated at 28 °C for 24h. For comparison of strains growth behaviour, the area under the curve (AUC) 

was used. Using the "Analyse" tool from GraphPad Prims software,  

Traceability and Confirmation  
During the growth curve assay, the presence of a contaminant in samples was detected. In order 

to trace their origin, samples were taken from all flasks and spread on plates with TSA medium. After 

48h, colonies were observed with a stereomicroscope and the colonies that appeared to be different were 

inoculated in a new plate. Subsequently, DNA from these colonies was extracted by boiling method and 

isolates were differentiated by M13 PCR-fingerprinting. The assay was repeated and the results 

presented in this work refer to this second assay. At the end of the 15-day assay, samples were also taken 

from each flask, the microorganisms were grown on plates with TSA medium, DNA from the colonies 

observed after 48h was extracted by boiling method and the isolates were differentiated by M13 PCR-

fingerprinting to confirm the maintenance of isolates of interest at the end of the assay. 

DNA was extracted through boiling method, adapted from Sambrook et al. (1989). Biomass 

was collected into a microtube with 50 µl of TE buffer (10 mM Tris; 1 mM EDTA; pH 8). Tubes were 

heated to 100 °C for 10 minutes in a heating block, in order to lysate the cells and release DNA to the 

solution. Tubes were then centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10 minutes and supernatant was collected into 

a new tube. 



 

18 

 

M13 PCR-fingerprinting was performed in a total volume of 25 µl, with 1x PCR buffer 

(Invitrogen), 3 mM MgCl2, 25 pmol of primer csM13 (5’GAGGGTGGCGGTTCT3’) (Meyer et al., 

1993), 0.2 mM of dNTP’s mix, 1 U of Taq Polymerase and 1 µl of template DNA. Amplification was 

performed in a UNO II Thermal Cycler (Biometra, Germany), with the following conditions: 5 minutes 

of initial denaturation at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 1 minute of denaturation at 95° C, 2 minutes of 

annealing at 50 °C and 2 minutes of extension at 72°C, and by a final elongation step of 5 minutes at 72 

°C. 

PCR products were separated by gel electrophoresis, together with 1 kb plus DNA ladder, in a 

1.2% (w/v) agarose gel in 0.5x TBE buffer (40 mM Tris; 45 mM Boric acid; 1 mM EDTA; pH 8.3). 

Electrophoresis was run at 90V for 3h, after which gel was stained in an 0.5 µg/mL ethidium bromide 

solution and photographed in an Alliance 4.7 UV Transilluminator (Uvitec, Cambridge), using Alliance 

software version 15.15 (Uvitec, Cambridge).  

 

 

2.8 Determination of biosurfactant activity 

 

 After the 15 days of growth experiment, cells and solid carbon source were removed from the 

broth by centrifugation at 4000 g during 10 minutes and the supernatant of each sample was harvested 

for use in the biosurfactant activity assay. 

Qualitative assay - Emulsification activity 
The emulsification test was carried out using 1 mL of supernatant with 0.5 mL of n-hexadecane 

placed in a microtube and vortexed for 30s. The samples which produced a stable third layer were chosen 

to take part in a larger test using a final volume of 3 mL of supernatant and 3 mL of n-hexadecane. This 

suspension was vortexed for 2 minutes and the height of the emulsion layer was measured after 2h.  

Quantitative assay - Surface tension measurement 
 The surface tension of the supernatant was determined using a tensiometer (Kruss Force 

Tensiometer K100) at 25°C by the Du Noüy method (Du Noüy, 1925) (see Appendix I). Tensiometers 

calculate the surface tension with aid of an optimally wettable ring suspended from a precision balance. 

The liquid is raised until it contacts with the surface is registered. The sample is then lowered again with 

the purpose of the liquid film produced beneath the ring is stretched. As the film is stretched, a maximum 

force is experienced and that force is measured, allowing the surface tension calculation2. The data was 

collected and analysed by the software Kruss Laboratory Desktop [K100 Surface and Interfacial 

Tension].

CHAPTER III - Results and Discussion 
 

3.1 Screening of PAHs degradation potential of adaptive evolved microbial 

strains 
 

In order to evaluate the PAHs degradation potential of 47 strains isolated from AE experiments 

a direct evaluation and an indirect evaluation were carried out. Direct evaluation consists in quantify the 

degradation efficiency through HPLC by obtaining the calibration curves of the compounds 

naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene and dosing biological samples after growth with the 

compounds of interest as single carbon source. This implies a development of the HPLC method with 

parameter optimization and validation. Indirect evaluation corresponds to obtaining the cellular viability 

in the biological samples through MPN, also after growth with the compounds of interest as single 

carbon source. 

 

3.1.1 HPLC – Calibration curves with simple linear regression 
 

Calibration curves of one analyte were generated by plotting peak areas versus the standard 

concentrations (Figure 5A, 5C, 5E). For each concentration, triplicates were performed. 

The calibration curves were created using simple linear regression as statistical method because 

it allows the study of relationships between two quantitative variables. In this case, the x variable, 

regarded as the predictor, explanatory or independent variable, is the range of standard concentrations 

(ng/?L) of each PAH whereas the y variable, regarded as the response, outcome or dependent variable 

is the peak area quantified by HPLC. 

In order to find the best fitting line for this data set, the least squares criterion was applied where 

the residual error (or prediction error), i.e. the difference between the value predicted by the regression 

line and the observed value, is as small as possible.

The regression equation y = b1x + b0, that makes the sum of the squared residual error the 

smallest it can be, and other important regression analysis parameters such as retention times (RT) for 

naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene are summarized in Table 3.

and phenanthrene. In the linear regression, the points represent a mean of the measures with the respective standard

In order to support the assumptions of linearity in regression and independence, normality and 

equal variances of the error, a residual analysis was made by plotting the residuals versus the standard 

concentration of PAHs (Figure 5B, 5D, 5F).  Residuals were transformed in standardized residuals by 

dividing them by their standard deviation, making them unitless and directly comparable.  It can be 

observed that the standardized residuals are randomly distributed on the plot and they form a roughly 

horizontal band around the residual zero line. However, a data point on ANT’s plot and another data 

point on NAP’s plot stand out from the random pattern of the other residuals. It is known that, when 

data is normally distributed, 95% of the measurements will present standardized residuals values higher 

than -2 and smaller than 2. Therefore, any observations greater than 2 or smaller than 2 should be flagged 

as being an outlier. This happened for one of the 400 ng/µL NAP triplicates. When standardized 

residuals are greater than 3 or smaller than 3, they are considered as extreme outliers, which is the case 

of one of the 10 ng/µL ANT triplicates. Because the data sets are small, the points who were identified 

as outliers where excluded from the regression line (Zar, 2010). 

 For the three compounds, the R2 value - coefficient of determination - is greater than 95% which 

indicates a strong linear relationship between the response y and the x predictor. This means that in the 

case of naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene, respectively 99%, 99.84% and 97.34% of the peak 

area total variation is explained by the variation in the standard concentration and the rest of the variation 

is due to random error.  

Both naphthalene and phenanthrene calibration presented a high accuracy  (? 99.9%) confirming 

that the regression line provides estimated concentration values coinciding with the known standard 

concentrations. Yet, the anthracene calibration has a higher precision that translates into a lower standard 

deviation compared to naphthalene precision, which means that for it presents more coincident values 

in a series of concentration measurements taken from same sample by multiple injections. The 

phenanthrene calibration, although displaying the lowest percentage of accuracy and precision .shows 

an acceptable linearity.

3.1.2 HPLC – Strains degradation efficiency 

 

In a previous work, adaptive evolution experiments were performed in mineral medium M9 with 

different pollutants as sole carbon source for selective pressure. The WWTP inoculum was kept for over 

50 cycles and this strategy preserves the dominant microbial strains, leading to wash-out of the weakest 

ones.  The 47 strains in the present work were obtained from different experiments at several cycles and 

from selective solid media (ANT, PHE, GTS and MiO) and represent the diversity present on BBC 

collection. 

The residual PAH resulting from the microbial degradation was quantified by HPLC. Results 

are presented according to the cycle of adaptive evolution corresponding to strain’s isolation in order to 

assess the effectiveness of microbial adaptation (Figure 6). The degradation efficiency presented is 

relative considering the maximum and minimum degradation of each of the PAHs, for the set of strains.

Figure 6 Efficiency of degradation of 47 strains relative to the maximum and minimum value of degradation 

obtained in each of the PAHs after 15 days growth experiment. The efficiency values represented here range from 

0 to 1, where the worst degrader correspond to 0 and the best degrader correspond to 1. The graphs are organized 

by the 6 cycles of adaptive evolution from which the 47 strains under study come from. The bars refer to the mean 

± standard deviation.

The results showed that 90% of the 20 strains belonging to cycles 5, 12, 16, 20 and 21 degraded 

more easily naphthalene compared to anthracene and phenanthrene. This is expected due to the chemical 

structure of the compounds since naphthalene has two benzene rings compared to anthracene and 

phenanthrene which have three, revealing a greater ability of the microorganisms to open the 

naphthalene’s rings, since it involves fewer catabolic enzymatic steps (Figure 1). This corroborates that 

the degradation efficiency of the microorganisms decreases with increasing structural complexity of 

PAH (LJS, 2016). 

Another factor that may justify the percentages of degradation efficiency is the different 

solubilities of the compounds in aqueous medium (M9), expressed in moles of solute per liter of solution. 

Although PAHs non-polar structures prevent dissolution in water, these compounds are not completely 

insoluble, particularly the low molecular weight PAHs (Abdel-Shafy and Mansour, 2016). For example, 

naphthalene’s aqueous solubility at 25°C is 249 µmol/L, a value that represents low water solubility but 

is much higher than anthracene and phenanthrene’s solubilities, which correspond to 0.37 µmol/L and 

7.2  µmol/L at 25°C, respectively (Pearlman et al., 1984). Therefore, small amounts of PAHs do dissolve 

in water, where they become bioavailable. As naphthalene presents the highest water solubility, then it 

is the PAH with greater availability for microbial degradation. 

However, it’s important to mention a relevant naphthalene’s property that can also explain its 

higher percentage of degradation efficiency. Naphthalene is a solid that sublimes at atmospheric 

temperature and pressure (Carrol, 2014). Thus, if naphthalene is able to go directly from the solid to the 

vapor phase, the reduction in naphthalene concentration may be due to loss of the compound to the air, 

instead of microbial degradation. However, the experiment conditions were the same for all strains in 

terms of amount of naphthalene and the volume of M9 medium, so it is expected that the losses were 

equally distributed and the differences observed between strains should be explained by their 

metabolism.  

About the three-ring PAHs, an overall tendency for a higher anthracene degradation efficiency 

is present, except for cycle 20.  

The standard deviations do not seem to be related to HPLC sensitivity because there are 

duplicates that have exactly the same value which translates into very low standard deviations. The 

differences can be explained by the fact that these are biological replicates where factors such as the 

different accessibility of the microorganisms to the solid substrate in the different samples, the microbial 

metabolism itself and adaptation to the medium with the complex carbon source as the only source of 

carbon and energy have influence on degradative behaviour. 

Interestingly, it is in cycle 29 that the highest values of degradation efficiency are observed. 

This result corroborates the success of the adaptive evolution experiment since the most evolved strains 

are the ones with the highest degradation efficiency. This may be due to the fact that over time these 

have been selected by the natural pressure of having only naphthalene, anthracene or phenanthrene as 

the sole carbon source, which translates into a greater metabolic, physiological and genomic adaptation 

in terms of gene expression and protein synthesis as well as in the production of biosurfactants or 

biofilms. Accordingly, these adaptations may translate into greater ease in using these compounds in 

their metabolism.

3.1.3 MPN– Strains viability 
 

In order to analyse indirectly the degradation of PAHs, assessment of the viability of strains at 

the end of the degradation assays were performed by MPN. This method estimates the concentration 

(cells/mL) of viable microorganisms in a sample by replicate liquid broth growth in ten-fold dilutions. 

MPN was used for the viability experiment because the substrates under study – naphthalene, anthracene 

and phenanthrene - are solid at strain’s growth temperature (28ºC) and therefore they would interfere in 

methods that would use the optical density at 600 nm as a monitoring parameter.  

It is observed in Figure 7 that 93,62% of strains showed growth above the concentration of cells 

/ ml from the initial inoculum. This result is expected because these microorganisms have been selected 

from adaptive evolution experiments for being interesting for their degradation capacity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Considering that for all MPN’s tests, the initial inoculum concentration used was 8 x 106 

cells.mL-1 and strains have the same amount of available PAH as the sole carbon source, the observed 

differences in viability results present on Figure are due to lower or higher degradation efficiency.

study as sole carbon source. The line in the graphs corresponds to reference value 6.90 corresponding to the 8 x 

106 cells that were inoculated first. 



 

29 

 

For strains BBC|293, BBC|309 and BBC|314 that exhibited a cells/mL value lower than the 

initial inoculum, it can be concluded that there was a loss of viability. This phenomenon could be due 

to an inability of the strain to metabolize the compounds naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene 

although this is not expected since they were selected from experiments where they had pollutants as 

the only source of carbon. Strain BBC|293 of cycle 5 and strain BBC|314 of cycle 20 are derived from 

the experience of adaptive evolution in phenanthrene and was also isolated in solid medium with 

phenanthrene. Strain BBC|309 of cycle 16 comes from the experience in glyceryl tristearate and was 

also isolated in solid medium containing glyceryl tristearate. It should be noted that in all three cases, 

the experience of adaptive evolution and the medium in which the strains were isolated contains the 

same compound as the sole carbon source, which does not give evidence of a high metabolic plasticity. 

Strains BBC|293, BBC|309 and BBC|314 demonstrated less viability in naphthalene relative to 

anthracene and phenanthrene. Compared to HPLC results (Figure 5), there is no consistency in this case 

because the degradation efficiency of naphthalene is higher and the reasons for this have already been 

enumerated above. In the other compounds, for strain BBC|293 there is concordance since for the 

anthracene presented higher viability and degradation efficiency than for phenanthrene, although its 

experience of adaptive evolution and its isolation contained phenanthrene as a single carbon source. As 

to strain BBC|309, it presents equal results in terms of cell viability and a greater efficiency of anthracene 

degradation. This bacteria was presumptively identified in the scope of Pedro Teixeira’s work as 

belonging to the genus Shinella. A species belonging to the genus Shinella described as capable of 

achieving greater degradation of anthracene was isolated from activated sludge bioreactor treating 

municipal wastewater (Ntougias et al., 2015). It is important to mention that this strain was once again 

isolated in cycle 20 of adaptive evolution in glyceryl tristearate, reinforcing the idea of its ability to 

survive having the pollutant as the only source of carbon. For strain BBC|314, the HPLC results show a 

higher efficiency in phenanthrene degradation which is consistent with its origin in an experience of 

adaptive evolution and isolation in phenanthrene. However, the lowest viability was also found for that 

compound. As for naphthalene and anthracene, the strain had the same viability value for both.  

Considering the dendrogram constructed from the profiles obtained by PCR-fingerprinting 

(using primers M13, Ph, GTG5, Appendix D), it should be noted that strain BBC|293 and strain BBC|314 

are phylogenetically close with a similarity higher than 90%. In addition, the fact that they respectively 

belong to evolution cycle 5 and 20 indicates that the most recent strain may be the result of the evolution 

of the older strain. 

Nevertheless, the absence of concordance between HPLC and MPN can be explained not by 

strains degradation low efficiency but by the growth curve characteristics. The final phase of growth is 

the death phase where a net loss of culturable cells is observed. During this phase, total count of 

microorganisms may remain constant but the viable count decreases by various reasons, such as 

depletion of nutrients.  In some cases, death is accompanied by actual cell lysis which results in 

accumulation of toxic products in addition to the metabolites already produced during growth.  

Once again, it can be seen that the highest values of cell viability are observed in cycle 29. This 

result also corroborates the success of the adaptive evolution experiment since the most evolved strains 

are the ones with the greatest growth. This may be due to the fact that over time these have been selected 

by the natural pressure of having only naphthalene, anthracene or phenanthrene as the sole source of 

carbon, which translates into greater metabolic, physiological and genomic adaptation and consequently 

greater ease to grow in environments with these pollutants.

3.2 Selection of best PAH degraders 
 

In order to evaluate the PAHs degradation potential of 47 isolates, a degradation assay was 

carried out, having the hydrocarbons naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene as the only source of 

carbon and energy.  Further quantification of residual substrate was performed using HPLC. In addition, 

the MPN method was also applied to evaluate the viability of the isolates at the end of the assay.  

These results presented values in mg/mL of residual substrate for naphthalene (HPLC|NAP), 

anthracene (HPLC|ANT) and phenanthrene (HPLC|PHE) and values of cells/mL of the isolates grown 

in naphthalene (MNP|NAP), anthracene (MNP|ANT) and phenanthrene (MNP|PHE). A univariate 

analysis of these two data sets composed of six variables is limited because it does not consider the 

possible correlations between the amount of residual substrate resulting from degradation and  viability 

of microorganisms in presence of that same substrate. In this case, multivariate analysis can be used to 

assess the best PAH degraders by possibly forming groups based on the degradation capability of each 

isolate, reducing the number of variables involved in the study (Fraga et al., 2016). 

There are numerous approaches in the area of multivariate analysis that allow joint analysis of 

different traits. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistic method that uses an orthogonal 

transformation to reduce a set of correlated variables into a set of uncorrelated new variables, called 

principal components (PCs), with minimal loss of information (Hongyu et al., 2016). 

PCs are calculated through linear combinations of the original variables with eigenvectors. The 

absolute value of an eigenvector determines the importance of the traits in a principal component. Each 

eigenvector is calculated from an eigenvalue of the correlation matrix of the data, which is related to the 

variance of each principal component. The first principal component (PC1) explains the highest 

percentage of the total variance, the second principal component (PC2) explains the second most, and 

so on, until all of the variance is explained (Fraga et al., 2016). To choose principal components that 

explained most of the variation in the data set, generally the Kaiser criterion is used, where PCs with 

eigenvalues greater than unity (?i ? 1) are selected (Kaiser, 1958). 

The mean results from the measurements of the six variables from the 47 isolates were gathered 

in a matrix in order to perform PCA. The data were standardized by subtracting the average and dividing 

by the standard deviation; similarity was calculated applying Pearson’s correlation coefficient to the 

standardized matrix.  

 

PC1, PC2 and PC3 were selected because they explain 82% (&gt;75%) of the variance of the results 

(Table 4). Analysis of the correlation of original variables with the PCs (Table 5), revealed that PC1 

represents two kinds of responses along the axis: strain’s ability to grow on phenanthrene according to 

MPN and strain’s degradation efficiency for naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene consistent with 

HPLC results; PC2 represents a gradient in strain’s ability to grow on naphthalene according to MPN 

and PC3 represented a gradient in strain’s ability to grow on anthracene according to MPN. A detailed 

analysis of the explanatory variables for PC1, PC2, PC3, PC4, PC5 and PC6 can be found in Appendix 

G and H.

A PCA of this dataset was carried out with the aim of obtain a clearer perception of the strain’s 

performance, as each strain’s position in this analysis reflecting its global response in terms of the 

degradability and subsequent growth on three compounds studied. This analysis revealed mostly a 

distribution according to their respective isolation medium and adaptive evolution cycle, as evidenced 

in Figure 9 and Figure 10, respectively.

33 

 

The distribution of the strains by the space formed by the PCs can be observed in Figure 9 where 

the isolation medium is highlighted through different colours. 

The phenanthrene isolation medium is the one containing the largest number of strains, which 

are distributed widely across the space. In this medium, is verified the existence of strains that present 

the greatest discrepancies between MPN and HPLC, especially with anthracene as the only source of 

carbon. For example, the BBC|300 strain, derived from the experience of adaptive evolution in 

phenanthrene and isolated in phenanthrene in cycle 16, shows high viability, but did not show a high 

degradation efficiency. In the case of the BBC|295 strain, originating from the experience of adaptive 

evolution in phenanthrene and isolated in phenanthrene in cycle 16, the opposite is found with an 

intermediate degradation efficiency and very low viability. As regards to naphthalene as the sole source 

of carbon, both a highly viable strain (BBC|297 from the experience of adaptive evolution with 

phenanthrene and isolated in phenanthrene at cycle 16) and a strain with the lowest viability (BBC|364 

originating from the experience of adaptive evolution with phenanthrene and isolated in phenanthrene 

in cycle 29) are present. 

Apparently,  strains isolated in phenanthrene are able to degrade and grow in phenanthrene 

efficiently. However, for naphthalene and anthracene, there is a great variability in the response of the 

different strains in terms of efficiency and viability, reflecting a specialization in the degradation of 

phenanthrene as a source of complex carbon. 

As for strains isolated in anthracene, it can be observed that they are concentrated in the zone 

corresponding to high values of degradation efficiency and viability. Note that the BBC|398 strain comes 

from an adaptive evolution experiment in lubricating oil and has been isolated in anthracene. 

Interestingly, this strain has the best position in terms of the use of phenanthrene as the only available 

carbon source (in combination with BBC|392). Thus, it can be concluded that it presents metabolic 

plasticity in terms of the use of different degradation pathways for different carbon sources. 

The strains isolated in lubricating oil should also be emphasised because they are located in the 

zone of the space corresponding to the best positions regarding the use of naphthalene, anthracene and 

phenanthrene. This is the case of the promising BBC|392 strain, derived from the experience of adaptive 

evolution in glyceryl tristearate and isolated in lubricating oil in cycle 29, which shows the best results 

for anthracene and phenanthrene, being also relatively well positioned for naphthalene. 

The strains belonging to the glyceryl tristearate and tryptic soy agar media are located in the 

central zone of the graph, not revealing an interesting degradative potential with respect to the three 

carbon sources. 

In addition, from the distribution of the strains in the space of the PCs presented in Figure 10, 

the cycle of adaptive evolution to which they belong were highlighted with different colours. 

Furthermore, a dendrogram was constructed from the coordinates of the strains in the space of the PCs 

(using the euclidean distance and average linkage) and the different clusters – I to IV – are also 

highlighted in grey. 

It is noteworthy that the strains belonging to cycle 29 constitute the majority of cluster II which 

is located in the zone where the best PAH degraders are expected to be. This may be considered as 

evidence of the success of the adaptive evolution experience. 



 

34 

 

The strains of cycles 5, 12, 16, 20 and 21 are mostly located in cluster I that occupies the central 

zone of the graph with an intermediate degradability that does not show much interest for the objective 

of this work. 

 Note that it is in cycle 16 that the greatest variability between HPLC and MPN is found as 

already explained above for the strains BBC|300 and BBC|295. 

Clusters IV and V formed by strains BBC|368 and BBC|300, respectively, have the most 

extreme and discrepant values. Cluster III also does not have strains that exhibit high degradation 

efficiencies.  

By analysing the graph of principal components and considering the adaptive evolution cycle 

and the isolation medium, strains BBC|297, BBC|392 and BBC|398 were selected for further study: 

(i) Strain BBC|297 was selected because it showed high growth in naphthalene, anthracene 

and phenanthrene. Although it belongs to an intermediate cycle of adaptive evolution 

(cycle 16) it was thought that it would be interesting to compare it with strains from 

recent cycles that are expected to be more evolved. 

(ii) Strain BBC|392 has the best positioning on the graph in terms of HPLC and NMP results 

for all the three carbon sources. 

(iii) Strain BBC|398 presents the best results for naphthalene and phenanthrene. 

In addition to the strains selected by the PCA, at that time another strain (BBC|652) was added 

to the BBC collection, identified and studied simultaneously. After PCA selection and during the first 

growth experiment, a contaminant capable of growth in the abiotic controls of naphthalene, anthracene 

and phenanthrene was identified. PCR fingerprinting was performed with DNA extracted from all the 

apparently distinct colonies in all the samples of the experiment. It was concluded that the 

microorganism did not belong to the collection, possibly referring to an environmental contaminant 

whose origin goes back to one of the solutions used for make the M9 mineral medium. A decision was 

made to include in future studies due to the fact that strain BBC|652 presents a degradative behaviour 

as its viability increased over time in the presence of the complex carbon sources under study. Note that 

after contaminant detection, the growth experiment was terminated and subsequently repeated 

successfully.

3.3 Identification of best PAH degraders 
 

Strains BBC|297, BBC|392 and BBC|398 were selected for future studies and their identification 

is essential. The bacterial16S rRNA gene sequencing results allowed to presumptively identify strains 

BBC|297 and BBC|398 as belonging to the genus Pseudomonas and strain BBC|392 as a member of the 

genus Acinetobacter. This is consistent with the genomic relatedness of the three strains (Appendix D) 

where it was possible to conclude that strains BBC|297 and BBC|398 are in the same cluster and that 

strain BBC|392 is located in a more distant cluster.

3.4 Characterization of best PAH degraders 
 

Following the identification of selected strains - BBC|297, BBC|392, BBC|398 and BBC|652 - 

different studies were carried out to gather as much information as possible about the microorganisms 

that may explain their degradative capacity. It is important to mention that the consortium was only 

composed of BBC|297, BBC|392 and BBC|398 strains - the evolved strains. 

Initially, the aim was to understand and differentiate the performance of the strains over time in 

terms of viability with naphthalene, anthracene or phenanthrene as the only carbon source through the 

establishment of growth curves. 

Subsequently, in the metabolic terms, the possible production of biosurfactants by the strains 

was investigated as a strategy to solubilize the pollutant compounds and, consequently, to increase their 

degradation efficiency. 

Finally, a search for functional genes associated with PAH catabolism and growth on catabolism 

intermediate substrate was made in order to unveil the possible metabolic pathways of degradation that 

could explain the degradative behaviour of each strain.

3.4.1 Comparison of growth curves 
 

In order to monitor the ability of the selected strains to grow of selected strains - BBC|297, 

BBC|392, BBC|398 and BBC|652 - in the presence of different carbon sources, growth curves were 

carried out for 15 days, being the evaluation parameter the cell viability by MPN. The results are plotted 

in Figure 11. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 11 Growth curves for the selected strains - BBC|297, BBC|392, BBC|398 and BBC|652 - having 

naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene and glucose as the carbon source for 15 days. In gray is also depicted the 

biotic control of the strain without any carbon source. 



 

38 

 

Growth experiments were performed having naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene or glucose 

as the sole source of carbon. The use of glucose aims to observe the behaviour in the presence of a 

simple and easily metabolized carbon source compared to the PAHs, which are complex carbon sources. 

It can be seen in Figure 11 that the greatest viability values over time are obtained having glucose as the 

sole carbon source in all strains. 

 All experiments started with the same initial inoculum. For strains BBC|297 and BBC|398 it is 

found that during the first 24 hours there is an increase of approximately 1-log step and 2-log steps in 

the presence of the PAHs or glucose as the sole carbon source, respectively. In the case of strain 

BBC|297 a stabilization phase is observed after this increase in all growth curves up to 288 hours. 

Thereafter, the strain maintains the viability value for glucose but for the three PAHs there is a 

substantial increase in the viability value suggesting the possibility of bi-phasic growth. The biphasic 

growth occurs when bacteria have distinct carbon sources, one of which is completely consumed before 

the bacterial synthetic machinery begins to consume the second carbon source (Cossio et al., 2012). In 

this case, the strains are supplemented with only one carbon source. However, when observing the 

control that does not have any carbon source can be observed that during the 336 hours it maintains 

some viability. This suggests that these strains are able to remain viable even without addition of a 

carbon source, entering a latency state or using products resulting from the autolysis of microorganisms 

and products of population metabolism as carbon source. This phenomenon observed here for all strains 

may be of interest in the production of commercial liquid inoculum which maintains viability for several 

days (at least 15 days). When the cells adapt to the medium with the complex carbon source and activate 

the genetic and enzymatic machinery necessary for its catabolism, then the second phase of growth 

enable higher viability values. For the strain BBC|398, a stabilization phase is also present in all growth 

curves up to approximately 288h. From this, what appears to be a two-phase growth in anthracene, while 

for naphthalene and phenanthrene there is a decrease in growth.  

Strain BBC|392 achieves the increase of 1-log step in the presence of glucose at 48 hours. 

Growth with the 3 PAHs remains approximately stable at a viability value close to the initial inoculum 

value from the start up to 240 hours. Thereafter an increase in viability for anthracene and phenanthrene 

is achieved up to the viability value obtained in the presence of glucose. Relative to naphthalene, there 

is a decrease in viability. The discrepancies between the high initial screening results and the low 

viability results in this experiment may be due to the fact that a different starting amount of inoculum 

could have been used since this bacteria tends to aggregate. 

 As for strain BBC|652, the increase of 2-log step in the presence of glucose at 24 hours is 

observed. This strain exhibits different growth behaviours with the three complex carbon sources. 

Despite presenting a small initial decrease possibly due to adaptation to the complex carbon source, 

elevated and increasing viability values were observed after 24 hours in the presence of phenanthrene, 

reaching a value higher than the value of registered viability after 336 hours in the presence of glucose. 

For the naphthalene it presents an intermediate and increasing growth from the 144 hours reaching the 

viability value registered in the presence of glucose at 336 hours. In the presence of anthracene, the 

strain has the lowest viability values, noting an increase from 240 hours, but not reaching the viability 

values recorded in the presence of glucose. 

 The consortium presents initially an increase of 3-log step in the presence of glucose and a 1-

log step in the presence of each of the three PAHs. The viability values remain relatively stable during 

the 336 hours never reaching the viability values recorded in the presence of glucose. From 288 hours a 

slight increase in the three growth curves corresponding to the three PAHs is observed, being this 

increase more evident in the case of phenanthrene. 



 

39 

 

From the growth curves, it can be concluded that in all cases in the presence of PAHs there is 

an adaptation phase corresponding to a plateau in the graph, that represents the adaptation of the 

microorganisms to a new culture medium and the exposure to complex carbon sources. The initial 

growth observed in some cases may be due, for example, to the fact that the bacteria present in the initial 

inoculum were growing in the general medium TSA and presented high metabolic rates and 

consequently a high fitness, that is, the reproduction rate was high. It is further noted that at 240 to 288 

hours corresponding to days 10 and 12 of the experiment, a substantial growth in the complex carbon 

sources is generally observed, suggesting the existence of an initial phase of growth and a secondary 

phase where the microorganisms access the substrate and are able to metabolize it more efficiently. 

 In order to compare the strains with each other, the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated 

and the percentages of AUC in each condition relative to the maximum AUC in glucose was determined 

for each strain. The AUC value in glucose from the consortium, being the maximum value, was used as 

the reference value. 

 

 

 

 

Graph A of Figure 12 shows the distribution of percentages of relative growth in each PAH 

organized by the strain and referring to the 15 days of growth. Overall, most of the values are between 

80% and 90%. It should be noted that the values found below 80% refer only to the BBC|392 and 

BBC|652 strains, which again reinforces the idea of being less efficient PAH degraders. In fact,  

BBC|392 strain exhibits the worst result as most growth percentages are below 80%, with naphthalene 

being the carbon source with the lowest value, followed by phenanthrene having both PAHs lower 

percentages than the control. This may be due to the inability of to deal with the toxicity inherent to 

naphthalene and the greater complexity of phenanthrene as a carbon source. Strain BBC|652 exhibits a 

very disperse behaviour with a high range of percentages of relative growth in different PAHs. 

Interestingly, this strain has a greater facility in degrading phenanthrene, the more complex carbon 

source. Furthermore, strain BBC|652 also shows the greatest discrepancy between growth percentages 

without carbon source - control - and in the presence of complex carbon sources. The highest relative 

growth percentages occur for the BBC|297 and BBC|398 strains, with the former apparently more easily

degrading anthracene. Concerning the consortium, it is interesting to note that the percentages are 

relatively close and high, with no particular carbon source being highlighted. 

Graph B of Figure 12 also shows the distribution of percentages of relative growth in each PAH 

organized by the strain, but referring only to the last 48 hours of the growth experiment (between 288 

and 336 hours), since it was within this time interval that there was a general change in the degradative 

behaviour in the strains with an increase of relative growth percentages. 

The most interesting result belongs to strain BBC|297 since it is observed that percentages 

relative to growth in the presence of PAHs increased to values greater than 90% and to the percentage 

of control, with anthracene maintaining the highest value. This strain comes from the adaptive evolution 

and isolation medium with phenanthrene as the only source of carbon. 

In the case of the BBC|398 strain it is also curious to note the relevant increase in the percentage 

of anthracene growth to a value greater than 90%, with naphthalene and phenanthrene having values 

similar to or lower than control, which may suggest a possible specialization of the strain on anthracene 

degradation. This result is interesting because the strain BBC|398 was isolated in anthracene-containing 

medium as the sole carbon source from an adaptive evolution experiment in lubricant oil. 

For the strain BBC|392, an increase in the relative percentages of growth in anthracene and 

phenanthrene is observed to values greater than 80% whereas in naphthalene a decrease is still observed 

below 70%. The strain BBC|652 maintains the trend shown in Graph A, increasing its relative growth 

percentages overall. 

The consortium also shows an increase in the relative percentages of growth, highlighting 

anthracene and phenanthrene with values higher than control. At this time naphthalene exhibits a value 

similar to the control, decreasing the degradation efficiency of this compound, again possibly due to the 

accumulation of toxic products. It may be concluded that the consortium does not exhibit a degradative 

behaviour that stands out in relation to the strains growing singly but positions at high relative growth 

values. This may be related to the fact that the microbial consortium needs a period of adaptation, which 

consists of pre-enrichment and enrichment phases that depend on the substrate availability and the ability 

of the microorganisms composing it to degrade it. Comparative studies of degradation of aromatic 

hydrocarbons in crude oil using pure bacterial species and mixed bacterial consortium showed that the 

bacterial consortia had a higher rate of degradation (51.8%) than a single Pseudomonas sp. (40.3%) 

during 40 days incubation period (Cerqueira et al., 2011).  In the present work, the strains were obtained 

from wastewater which commonly contains microorganisms that not only contains microorganisms that 

are already part of a natural consortia. It is reported that bacterial species have synergistic interactions 

amongst themselves which enhance PAHs degradation. Due to these interactions between consortium 

members, it is suggested that possibly the first species degrades the substrate which may obstruct further 

degradation of compounds by the second species. Then, the second species degrades the compounds left 

half-degraded. The degradative capacity of any microbial consortium is not certainly the result of adding 

together the capacities of individual strains that form the association. Since microorganisms present 

different PAHs degradation efficiencies, when a consortium of them is used to degrade various forms 

of hydrocarbons in a contaminated site, the total degradation is more effective but synergistic and 

antagonistic interactions and partition of compounds utilized for microbial metabolism should be 

considered (Gupta et al., 2016).

3.4.2 Evaluation of biosurfactant production 
 

After 15 days of growth in M9 supplemented with naphthalene, anthracene or phenanthrene as 

sole carbon source, a preliminary study with the selected strains - BBC|297, BBC|392, BBC|398 and 

BBC|652 - was carried out to investigate the possible production of biosurfactants by these 

microorganisms. 

Initially, an emulsification test was performed. The aim of this qualitative study is to evaluate 

which strains present biosurfactant production potential by direct observation of emulsion formation 

after addition of hexadecane between the aqueous and organic phases.  

Of the four strains tested, it was only possible to verify stable emulsion formation for the 

BBC|392 and BBC|398 strains. These two strains were identified as potentially biosurfactant producers 

and selected for a quantitative study, with the determination of surface tension in order to measure the 

surface activity of biosurfactants (if any) with the ring method (see Annexe I). Surface tension values 

were measured on the supernatant of the cultures with strains BBC|392 and BBC|398 on naphthalene, 

anthracene and phenanthrene. In addition, surface tension measurements in M9 medium with each of 

the PAHs individually, M9 medium only and ultrapure water were also performed as controls (Figure 

13).

Figure 13 Representation of the surface tension values of the supernatant resulting from the growth of 

the BBC | 392 and BBC | 398 strains having naphthalene, anthracene or phenanthrene as the sole source 

of carbon. As controls, measurements were made in ultrapure water, M9 and M9 with PAHs.

 In this study, M9 medium was used because it does not have intrinsic surfactant activity, 

presenting a surface tension (72.62 ± 0.023 mN/m) very close to ultrapure water value (72.29 ± 0.012 

mN/m). There are some discrepancies between the values of surface tension of the water in contact with 

the air in the literature. However, for the same determination method, the experimental value of the 

literature for the surface tension of pure water at 25°C (72.00 ± 0.10 mN/m) is coincident with the value 

obtained in this work (Kalová and Mareš, 2015).  

However, it can be realized that samples with M9 + PAH supernatant present lower surface 

tension values relative to the sample with only M9. This leads to the conclusion that the substrate 

presents some surfactant activity which reduces the surface tension. Therefore, the M9 + PAH samples 

should be used as a negative control for the biological samples. 

In the case of naphthalene, the strain BBC|392 shows a small decrease in surface tension (71.67 

± 0.099 mN/m) relative to the M9 + NAP control (72.51 ± 0.045 mN/m). The same does not occur for 

strain BBC|398 (72.58 ± 0.043 mN/m). 

The most interesting results were obtained with anthracene, where strain BBC|392 exhibited a 

substantial reduction in surface tension (63.8 ± 0.023 mN/m) compared to the M9 + ANT control (72.17 

± 0.023 mN/m). The reduction presented by the strain BBC|398 is small (71.36 ± 0.019 mN/m). 

As for phenanthrene, strains BBC|392 and BBC|398 did not present any reduction of the surface 

tension in relation to the M9 + PHE control (72.26 ± 0.012 mN/m). On the contrary, the value is slightly 

above the value control (72.48 ± 0.020 mN/m and 72.62 ± 0.019 mN/m, respectively). 

Strain BBC|392 has proven to be the most promising in terms of biosurfactant production. 

However, according to the literature it is expected that microbial candidates for biosurfactant production 

decrease the surface tension to around 35 mN/m (Banat, 1997). In this work, a reduction of superficial 

tension to 63.8 mN/m was reached, revealing the potential of biosurfactant production but not revealing 

a relevant decrease. This low productivity may be due to the fact that after 15 days, the production of 

biosurfactant is still in the initial stages, which reflects into a low concentration of the compound and 

consequently a weak decrease of the surface tension. It is possible that the strain only produces the 

biosurfactant in the presence of PAH to facilitate its solubilization and uptake, so the substrate acts as 

inducer of production. All biosurfactants are synthetized in the cytosol though ribosomal or non-

ribosomal peptide synthesis and specific biosynthetic enzyme activity, being after exported to the 

extracellular medium if applicable. Thus, the bacterial cell needs to activate genes and metabolic 

pathways that lead to compound production. Besides, at each stage, intermediates or the final 

compounds could have detrimental biophysical effect on the producing cell. The literature suggests that 

biosurfactants produced by bacteria are considered strong if their surface tension ranges from 22 - 25 

mN/m. The physicochemical nature of biosurfactants is considered as the main mechanism that limits 

the production of stronger compounds, creating a selective pressure where the production of 

biosurfactants considered stronger leads to unsustainable self-damage, being unfavourable genetically 

and phenotypically. For example, stronger biosurfactants may show increased ability to disrupt 

membranes due to their phospholipidic nature. The production of stronger biosurfactants can also 

solubilize or disrupt proteins or other macromolecules inside cells that could interrupt essential 

metabolic pathways or secretion systems, and may even affect the production of the biosurfactant and 

the accumulation of toxic products to the cell (Moldes et al., 2007). 

Moreover, there are a number of factors that affect the production of biosurfactants. The 

production of biosurfactants is a set of chemical reactions and consequently is affected by environmental 

factors like pH, salinity and temperature. In addition, nutritional factors such as the carbon source - 



 

43 

 

chemical nature and quantity - also affect the process (Gakpe et al., 2007). Petroleum–contaminated 

sites were identified to be good sources of hydrocarbons for induction of biosurfactant production by 

microorganisms (Chen et al., 2012). 

The BBC|392 strain has been presumptively identified as belonging to the genus Acinetobatcer 

sp. This genus is described as containing biosurfactant producing species at sites hydrocarbons 

contaminated sites (see Appendix C). For example, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus BU03 enhance the 

solubility and biodegradation of phenanthrene (Zhao and Wong, 2009). This strain is reported as 

producing an extracellular liposaccharide responsible for the formation of an emulsion (Kim et al., 

1997). Also Acinetobacter radioresistens KA53 produce another bioemulsifier complex designed alas 

an (Navon-Venezia et al., 1995). Recently, strains of Acinetobacter baumanii and Acinetobacter 

variabilis, isolated from oil-contaminated soil, have been found to produce a rhamnolipid molecule, 

elucidating the true potential of oil refinery areas as sites for isolation of new non-pathogenic 

microorganisms capable of biosurfactant production (No and Ankulkar, 2017).

3.4.3 Unravelling the degradative pathways of PAHs 

 

Search for PAH catabolic genes 
 

 In order to unveil the degradation pathways used by the selected strains - BBC|297, BBC|392, 

BBC|398 and BBC|652 - a PCR approach was applied targeting genes that encode enzymes for the 

catabolism of PAHs. The results are shown in Figure 14. 

 

 

According to Figure 14, the gene encoding the initial dioxygenase enzyme (PAH ring 

hydroxylating dioxygenase, PAH-RDH) was only detected on strain BBC|652. 

It would be expected that amplification would also occur for the strains belonging to the genus 

Pseudomonas since the primers were constructed taking into account the different allele types present 

in the data base common to the Gram negative PAH degraders such as Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, 

Commamonas, Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, Alcaligenes and Polaromonas strains (Cébron et al., 

2008). Despite the gene coding for the enzyme dioxygenase had not been detected with these primers, 

even with optimization of PCR conditions, that does not mean that there is no enzyme coding region in 

the genome of these strains. Rather, it is assumed that such a region must exist since strains are capable 

of degrading PAH and dioxygenase is essential to the process of activating PAH for catabolism in the 

upper catabolic pathway. The primers can then be non-specific for these microorganisms because they 

have sequences that differ genetically from the remaining dioxygenase families. PAH-RDH are broadly 

distributed across microbial taxa and one of the principal differences between families are the physical 

characteristics of the active site, which consequently affect the type and range of PAH substrates on 

which the enzyme will act and funnel to a productive catabolic lower pathway (Cravo-Laureau, 2017). 

Due to the divergence of lower metabolic pathways in the catabolism of PAH with the formation 

of catechol and/or gentisate intermediate metabolites from salicylate (Figure 1), different primers were 

used to allow their distinction. 

Figure 14 Photograph of the electrophoresis gel with the results of PCR amplification reactions whose targets 

were PAHs catabolism genes. The red arrows highlight the amplified bands of interest. The 1Kb DNA ladder was 

used.  



 

45 

 

In case of catechol synthesis, if the enzyme that acts on the molecule is the catechol 1,2-

dioxygenase the cleavage is in the ortho position. Primers C12OF/R were reported as capable of 

amplifying a region of the gene encoding the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (Sei et al., 1999). 

If the enzyme to act on the catechol is the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase then the cleavage is in the 

meta position. Primers C12OF/R have been described as capable of amplifying a region of the gene 

encoding the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (Sei et al., 1999). 

When gentisate is synthesized from salicylate, the enzyme involved is salicylate 5-hydroxylase. 

The primer sgp319F/1238R targets a region of the gene coding for this hydroxylase (Izmalkova et al., 

2013). 

In Figure 14 is shown a photograph of the electrophoresis gel highlighting the bands of interest 

that amplified through the gene-targeted PCR. In Table 7 there is a summary of the metabolic pathways 

that might be used by the selected strains according to these results. 

It can be seen that for the primer targeting the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase there is only weak 

amplification for the BBC|392 strain. It can be concluded that there is only evidence that this strain is 

capable of following a degradation pathway involving a formation of the catechol from the salicylate 

followed by ortho cleaving of the catechol molecule with the formation of succinate and acetyl-CoA 

that entered in tricarboxylic acid cycle. This enzyme belongs to the intradiol dioxygenase family that 

breaks the aromatic ring between two adjacent hydroxyl groups of catechol. It is also possible to 

conclude about the possible localization of the gene since the genes for ortho cleavage are described as 

located on chromosome. Organization of genes differs in the gene order and operon distribution. For 

example, for Acinetobacter calcoaceticus there are two enzymatic systems for degradation of catechol 

while for Pseudomonas putida there is only one enzymatic system coded apparently by different genes 

(Cravo-Laureau, 2017). A study showed that Acinetobacter sp. WSD completely degraded phenanthrene 

via salicylate pathway instead of protocatechuate pathway (Shao et al., 2015). Although the BBC|392 

strain has only shown amplification for the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase enzyme, an Acinetobacter sp. 

strain which metabolizes naphthalene and anthracene through catechol meta cleavage with the catechol 

2,3-dioxygenase enzyme was reported (Jiang, Qi and Zhang, 2018). Thus, it cannot be affirmed that 

BBC|392 only performs catechol ortho cleavage because it may be the primers that are non-specific for 

the nucleotide sequence coding for the gene associated with the meta cleavage.  

About the primers targeting the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene, there is amplification in strains 

BBC|297 and BBC|652, pointing out that these strains may follow a degradation pathway involving the 

synthesis of catechol from salicylate with a meta cleavage of the catechol molecule with the formation 

of the metabolites acetaldehyde and pyruvate which also participate in the cycle of tricarboxylic acids. 

It is also possible to conclude about the possible localization of the gene since the genes for meta 

cleavage are described as being organized on an operon composed by 13 genes located on a plasmid 

(Cravo-Laureau, 2017). Strain BBC|297 was presumptively identified has belonging to the genus 

Pseudomonas. It is described that the meta pathway of catechol metabolism is induced during growth 

on naphthalene or salicylate in different Pseudomonas spp. (Barnsley, 1976). In addition, ortho 

pathways enzymes are also present in those strains. The authors suggest that separate regulatory systems 

for the ortho and meta catechol pathways in Pseudomonads. However, in this work, only amplification 

for the meta pathway was obtained, which does not invalidate the possibility of genes coding for ortho 

pathway enzymes to exist but the non-specificity of the primer used does not allow amplification. 

BBC|652 was presumptively identified as belonging to the genus Paraburkholderia. Genus 

Burkholderia comprehends a large number of diverse species which include many important pathogens 



 

46 

 

as well as environmental species. Based on phylogenetic analyses, a division of the genus was proposed 

in 2014 where Burkholderia species contain clinically relevant and phytopathogenic species and 

Paraburkholderia species are primarily environmental (Sawana, Adeolu and Gupta, 2014). In previous 

studies, where the genus division was not yet applied, the genes encoding catechol 2,3-dioxygenase 

were present in eight microorganisms belonging to Burkholderiaceae family, Burkholderia included, 

contrasting with the genes encoding for catechol 1,2-dioxygenase which are observed in nearly all 

Burkholderiaceae (Pérez-Pantoja et al., 2012).  

As to primers targeting the salicylate 5-hydroxylase, amplification occurs also for strains 

BBC|297 and BBC|652 indicating that these strains have the genes required for degradation pathway 

involving the formation of gentisate from salicylate, which culminate in the opening of the aromatic ring 

originating pyruvate and fumarate. The genus Pseudomonas, presumably identified as the genus of the 

BBC|297 strain, includes strains isolated from oil-contaminated soil which present genes that allow the 

degradation of naphthalene via the gentisate pathway rather than the catechol pathway (Fuenmayor et 

al., 1998). As for the genus Burkholderia, presumably associated with strain BBC|652, it is also reported 

as capable of transforming salicylate via the gentisate pathway during the degradation of naphthalene 

and phenanthrene (Tittabutr et al., 2011). 

Note that it was not possible to conclude anything about possible degradation pathways of the 

BBC|398 strain since it did not show amplification with any of the primers, and although various 

optimization conditions were tested, no success was achieved. 

With respect to plasticity in the use of metabolic pathways it can be concluded from Table 7 

that the BBC|297 and BBC|652 strains by having genes encoding enzymes belonging to different 

degradation pathways are more adapted. However, it cannot be claimed that these are the only 

degradation pathways used by the strains.  

The existence of appropriate biocatalytic systems, which requires that microorganisms contain 

genetic information for the production of degradative enzymes is a first limiting factor for 

biodegradation. If those enzymes are synthetized, the process will be determined by the environmental 

conditions. Analysis of PAHs catabolic genes in different bacterial genera can give valuable information 

about the evolution of enzyme structure-function relationships and the evolution and diversity of 

catabolic pathway genes via horizontal transfer, transposition events, DNA rearrangement, gene fusion 

and point mutation. In bioremediation, assessing the genetic information is crucial for monitoring 

bacterial populations that degrade PAHs in contaminated sites.

Monitoring of growth in intermediate metabolite phthalate 
 

Phthalate is a metabolic intermediate in the degradation pathways of anthracene and 

phenanthrene (Figure 1). A growth experiment was carried out with phthalate in order to understand if 

the selected strains - BBC|297, BBC|392, BBC|398 and BBC|652 - are able to use it as a single carbon 

source from the growth curves that are presented in Figure 15. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It can be seen from the Figure 15 that strain BBC|652 is the only one that is clearly capable of 

degrading and growing in phthalate. However, the viability values achieved are not very high since not 

even the increase of 1-log step is achieved. This strain was presumptively identified as belonging to the 

genus Paraburkholderia. A strain of Burkholderia sp. was able to use 2-naphthanoate (a precursor 

metabolite of phthalate) as sole carbon and energy source (Morawski et al., 1997). The features of this 

pathway are convergent with those of phenanthrene with formation of phthalate and protocatechuate.

control where the respective strains have no carbon source.

Chapter III – Conclusion and Future Perspectives 
 

This project intended to develop a novel bioaugmentation consortium from a sub-set of 47 

evolved strains belonging to BBC collection throught selection, identification and metabolic/genetic 

characterization of best PAHs degraders (Figure 16). 

A preliminary interpretation of these results is present in this thesis but a more extensive analysis 

is required to establish the consortia. 

 

 

Figure 16 Overview of the work flow of this project. 

 

From the results obtained it is possible to conclude that the adaptive evolution experiments prior 

to this work were successful, since through the quantification by HPLC and the monitoring of cell 

viability by MPN a trend was clearly observed where the strains considered to be the best degraders 

belonging to more recent cycles of adaptive evolution. 

The PCA allowed the selection of three strains considered the best degraders considering their 

distribution in the space formed by the PCs. It was observed in this distribution concordance with what 

was found previously, standing out cycle 29 as the cycle of the best degraders. 

Strain BBC|392 belonging to the adaptive evolution cycle 29 showed the best location in PCA 

and was considered the most promising strain. However, by observation of growth curves, this was the 

strain with the worst result, reaching the lowest viability values for all carbon sources. As the strain 

tends to form aggregates, which leads to uncertainty about how many cells are effectively in the initial 

inoculum, this can be a disadvantage for the preparation of a commercial inoculum for the consortium. 

Thus, the discrepancies between the high initial screening results and the low viability results on growth 



 

49 

 

curves may be due to the fact that a different starting amount of inoculum was used. However, this strain 

has the interesting property of apparently producing some biological molecule with surfactant activity, 

and the strains producing biosurfactants confer an advantage for the bioremediation because they more 

easily have access to the insoluble substrates. In addition, there is only evidence that the strain BBC|392 

follows the ortho cleavage of catechol as degradation pathway, which could in part justify the low 

viability results as it only follows a catabolic pathway compared to greater metabolic plasticity of other 

known strains. The hypothesis is that the strain produces biosurfactants as an aid to its survival in places 

whose only source of carbon is complex and in metabolic terms does not present the best efficiency. It 

would be important to try to understand the chemical nature of the possible biosurfactant produced by 

the strain through mass spectrometry, for example, in order to assess if it can have any interest. 

As for the selected strain BBC|398, it also belongs to the adaptive evolution cycle 29. In relation 

to this strain, it has a degradative behaviour preferentially of using anthracene as carbon source which 

is coincident with de fact that it has previously been isolated in medium containing only this carbon 

source. With respect to genes associated to the catabolism of PAHs, this strain remains an enigma since 

it did not show amplification with any of the tested primers. 

Another of the selected strains was BBC|297, belonged to adaption evolution cycle 16 and was 

selected not only because it presents good viability results for naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene 

but also it was thought to be interesting to compare strains from different cycles. This strain turned out 

to be the most interesting one, since it exhibits a high degradative pattern for naphthalene, anthracene 

and phenanthrene. In addition, it presents metabolic plasticity in degradation pathways, and could follow 

the catechol pathway (meta-cleavage) or the gentisate pathway. 

Studies were also carried out with strain BBC|652 which is not a strain from adaptive evolution 

tests but rather a microorganism detected as a contaminant but that exhibited interesting degradation 

behaviour, especially for phenanthrene. The results obtained proved this because it was with this strain 

that the highest values of growth in the presence of phenanthrene were verified. Regarding the 

degradative pattern, there is clearly a trend towards the use of carbon sources. However, contrary to 

what is expected, the tendency is to more easily degrade the more complex carbon source and less easily 

the simpler carbon sources. In addition, the strain BBC|652 was the strain that presented the most 

positive results for the amplification of the genes of interest, which means it has the most metabolic 

plasticity from all. It was possible to detect the presence of the initial dioxygenase essential for the 

activation of the PAHs for degradation, with homologies with the dioxygenase of other bacterial genera 

known to be PAH degraders. Moreover, it was possible to assume that the strain is capable of using the 

catechol degradation pathway (meta-cleavage) and the gentisate degradation pathway. Remarkably, it 

was the only strain able to grow using phthalate as the only source of carbon, indicating the presence of 

genes and enzymatic machinery that enable phthalate degradation. This may be the reason why it has 

the best results in phenanthrene. 

In general, the existence of promising strains in metabolic and genetic terms that may be part of 

the consortium has been proven. However, it would be important to carry out further studies that may 

give more certainty regarding the degradative profile of the strains. What are the genes present in the 

genome of these strains that allow the activation and degradation of PAHs? To access this information 

and the identification at species level, whole genome sequencing is an option. For the strains with 

metabolic plasticity that could follow simultaneous degradation pathways, what are the degradation 

pathways they actually adopt and in what conditions? Several strategies can be deployed as reverse 

transcriptase-PCR, identification of metabolites thought mass spectrometry or kinetic tests to follow the 



 

50 

 

most relevant catabolic enzymes activity. In addition, it would be important to perform more growth 

studies for a longer time (maybe months) to see if growth really is bi-phasic or not. 

Finally, for the consortium composed of strains BBC|297, BBC|392 and BBC|398, high viability 

values where observed what  may therefore have be considered a success. What strains were maintained 

over time? Is there a predominant strain? Would the addiction of strain BBC|652 increase the 

degradation efficiency of the consortium? Also, considering that the consortium would be used in places 

where there is a mixture of PAHs and other compounds as well as several other microorganisms, it 

would be of great importance to understand how these factors, among others (salinity, temperature, 

concentration, for example) would affect the degrading behaviour of the consortium. Multiple 

approaches can be used to approximate the in vitro conditions of in situ conditions, mimicking the 

expected microbial ecology at the contaminated sites.
