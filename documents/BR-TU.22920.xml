For tropical rivers with broad floodplains areas, the flood pulse
is a key factor that initiates and controls the the productivity
of the energy flow of these systems. Floodplains of tropical
rivers differ from the river continuum where communities
along the river are distributed so as to harmonize with their
feeding habitats to utilize the transported material. The pro-
duction of biomass and the cycling of nutrients occurs mainly
in the lake area of floodplains.

The periodicity of the hydrological cycle in floodplains
influences (in a positive manner) the aquatic productivity and

ecological processes, as a result of changes in the areas along
floodplains. Therefore, unlike the behavior predicted by the
river continuum concept, in which communities are found
organized along the longitudinal axis so as to maximize the
transport of materials and energy from a high to low gradient,
flooding events cause large changes in all of the hydrographic
basin of rivers with floodplains (JUNK et al. 1989). These changes
in turn influence communities such as the zooplankton, which
according to WETZEL &amp;amp; LIKENS (1991) include major herbivores
as well as important predators in aquatic ecosystems. There-

Acre floodplain) was investigated with respect to seasonal changes. Sampling was performed at three collection
stations, generally weekly, during the dry season between May 8, 1997 and October 31, 1997, and during the rainy
season between January 2, 1998 and February 24, 1998. The density and composition of rotifer species (48 taxons
of rotifers) were determined, and their diversity and abundance were observed to be greater, respectively, at
high-water and low-water. Anova was performed, by means of the F test, to test for seasonal differences in
environmental variables and rotifers, showing that there was a highly statistically significant difference for pH
and transparency (p &amp;lt;0.01). Pearson’s correlation was used to show that rotifer numbers during the low-water
phase correlated negatively with electrical conductivity (r = -0.8824, p &amp;lt;0.05) and during the high-water phase
correlated negatively with depth (r = -0.7513, p &amp;lt;0.05). Seasonal changes, caused by an increase in water levels
and the low diversification of niches, influenced the composition and abundance of the animal group studied.

RESUMO. A comunidade de rotíferos do Lago Amapá (meandro abandonado da planície de inundação do Rio
Acre) foi investigada sazonalmente. As amostragens foram realizadas semanalmente em três estações de coletas,
em dois períodos: estação seca entre 08/V/1997 e 31/X/1997 e estação chuvosa, entre 02/I/1998 e 24/II/1998.
A densidade e composição de rotíferos (48 táxons de rotíferos) foram determinadas. A diversidade e abundância
foram caracterizadas por serem maiores, respectivamente, nas águas altas e águas baixas. Anova e teste F foram
usados, visando observar diferenças sazonais nas variáveis ambientais e rotíferos. Transparência e pH foram
estatisticamente altamente significativos (p &amp;lt;0,01). As análises de correlações de Pearson revelaram que a
condutividade elétrica foi negativamente correlacionada com a densidade de rotíferos (r = -0,8824; p &amp;lt;0,05),
na fase de águas baixas, bem como, profundidade, na fase de águas altas (r = -0,7513; p &amp;lt;0,05). Mudanças
sazonais, causadas pelas flutuações do nível da água, e baixa diversificação dos nichos influenciaram a composi-
ção e abundância do grupo estudado.
PALAVRAS CHAVE. Planície de inundação, fase de águas altas, fase de águas baixas, comunidade de Rotifera.

fore, to understand lake metabolism is it necessary to evaluate
the biomass and the role of zooplankton in the ecosystem.

The ideal niche is defined by the tolerance levels of an
organism while the observed niche is that subset of tolerable
conditions actually occupied by the organism. Extreme abiotic
or biotic stress can cause local extirpation of a population – the
species becomes rare or even disappears from a place where it
once occurred. Predators or competitors may prevent the spe-
cies from effectively colonizing a habitat where abiotic condi-
tions might otherwise allow it to survive and flourish. The or-
der of possible answers leads to greater insight into the impor-
tance of abiotic and biotic constraints. The boundaries of pos-
sibility are defined first by tolerances, then by minimum growth
and finally by successful reproduction (KITCHELL 1998). Thus,
hydrological connectivity influences biodiversity (AMOROS 2001).

Rotifers are very important freshwater plankton and they
cover the ecologic niche of the the small filter feeders. The length
of their life cycle is two weeks or less (MARGALEF 1983), so their
study should involve samplings over a short period of time.

The ecological and taxonomic knowledge of zooplank-
ton in continental waters is important for understanding the
functioning of the aquatic ecosystem. Zooplankton in tropical
regions present a diversity of species of little known distribu-
tion in lakes, mainly those from abandoned meanders. Ecosys-
tems of this nature harbor species that they possess since ample
distribution until endemic, in accordance with the extent of
ecological niches propitiated by environmental conditions in-
fluenced by hydrographic basins. Rotifers are organisms that
have asexual and sexual phases, representing one of the main
plankton components in continental water communities. This
group shows a typical geographic distribution in basins, influ-
enced by its opportunistic form of occupation. This unique
manner of occupying diverse niches of continental water eco-
systems is influenced by the interaction of physical, chemical
and biological parameters. These factors determine the com-
plexity that results in the presence of different species and zoop-
lankton groups, verified from studies of community structure.

One of the continental water systems commonly found
in South America, characterized by marked seasonal changes
caused by fluctuations of the water level, are the floodplains.
They have been studied in Brazil, especially with regard to the
composition and ecology of zooplankton: GREEN (1972) in the
Pantanal Matogrossense, LANSAC-TÔHA et al. (1992, 1993),
BONECKER et al. (1994, 1996), and BONECKER &amp;amp; LANSAC-TÔHA (1996).
The zooplanktonic communities that inhabit different envi-
ronments present in floodplains, show a standard composi-
tion and abundance, depending on the physical, chemical and
biological conditions of the environment. Several studies of
community structure in the Amazonian basin have examined
these aspects, most noteworthy being: CARVALHO (1983), KOSTE
&amp;amp; ROBERTSON (1983), HARDY et al. (1984), ROBERTSON &amp;amp; HARDY
(1984), SANTOS-SILVA et al. (1989), BOZELLI (1992, 1994), and
WAICHMAN et al. (2002).

There have been few studies of zooplankton in lakes of
abandoned meanders, common in the state of Acre (SENDACZ &amp;amp;
MELO-COSTA 1991, KEPPELER &amp;amp; HARDY 2002). Therefore, the aims
of the present work were (I) to determine the difference in the
abundance and composition of Rotifera, in the major phases
of the hydrologic cycle and (II) to correlate some physical,
chemical and biological parameters with this composition.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Lago Amapá is a lake belonging to the hydrographic ba-
sin of the Rio Acre, to which it is permanently linked, and is
thus considered a whitewater lake according to SIOLI (1968).
Lago Amapá is situated in the municipality of Rio Branco with
the geographic coordinates 10°02’36”S and 67°50’24”W (see
figure 1 in KEPPELER &amp;amp; HARDY 2004). The lakes are surrounded by
forest, which is inundated during high water, and as a conse-
quence, there is a great input of organic matter from the forest
into the lake.

According to SALATI et al. (1978), the hydrologic complex
of the Amazon basin, is formed by thousands of small rivers
and has probably been in dynamic equilibrium, together with
the exuberant forest, for millennia. The lakes studied are situ-
ated south of the equator, beyond parallel 65°W, and receive a
minimum amount of precipitation in June/July. However,
whitewater streams that are in Brazilian Amazonia are very evi-
dent in the State of Acre in South Western Amazonia (SIOLI 1984).

The data on the biotic and abiotic parameters were col-
lected at the lake generally at weekly intervals (except in Octo-
ber), during two periods comprising the low-water phase (dry
season) between May 8, 1997 and October 30, 1997 and the
high-water phase (rainy season) between January 2, 1998 and
February 24, 1998. Three stations were selected: station I – a
region located close to a channel that connects Lago Amapá
with the Rio Acre; station II – an approximately central region
of the lake; and station III; the terminal region of the lake.

To carry out a quantitative analysis of the zooplankton,
the organisms were collected with a Van Dorn sampling bottle,
using a conical net (55 µm mesh) to filter 5 liters of water at
different depths. The samples were preserved in a solution of
4% formaldehyde. The samplings were counted in Sedgwick-
Rafter chambers (1mL) according to APHA (1992).

The determination of the physical, chemical and bio-
logical parameters, that is, water temperature (°C), transpar-
ency and depth of the water column (m), electrical conductiv-
ity (µS.cm-1), and dissolved oxygen (mg.L-1), was according to
GOLTERMAN et al. (1978), and included a modification of the
assay for dissolved oxygen using sodium azide (GOLTERMAN et
al. 1969).

Data were standardized (except pH) by logarithmic trans-
formation (log).The degree of significance of all values for the
studied of Rotifera and environmental variables among low
water period and high water period was calculated with Analy-

sis of Variance (ANOVA). Assumptions for ANOVA were veri-
fied. The tukey Test was used for means comparison using SAS
system (vs. 5, SAS 1998). The degree of significance of all values
for the studied variables among Rotifera and abiotic variables
was established by Pearson’s coefficient of variation. Simple
Linear Regression Analysis was used.

RESULTS

Environmental and biological variables were averaged
for the top and middle layers, where zooplankton are gener-
ally concentrated. The means and variations are listed in table
I. The composition of Rotifera included 48 taxons, of which
20 represented new registers for the floodplain of the Rio Acre
(Tab. II).

Some species of Rotifera have been showen to be com-
mon. Included in collections during the low-water phase pe-
riod were the following: Asplanchna sieboldi (Leydig, 1854);
Brachionus caudatus Barrois &amp;amp; Daday, 1884; Brachionus falcatus
Zacharias, 1898; Epiphanes macrourus (Barrois &amp;amp; Daday, 1894),
Filinia opoliensis (Zacharias, 1898); Keratella cochlearis Gosse,
1851, and Polyarthra vulgaris Carlin, 1943. In the high-water
phase, the species that predominated were Brachionus
calicyflorus Pallas, 1766, Brachionus calicyflorus anuraeformis
(Brehm, 1909), Filinia terminalis Plate, 1886, Keratella cochlearis
hispida Lauterborn, 1900, Thrichocerca similis Plate, 1886 and
Polyarthra vulgaris Carlin, 1943. Numerical density and num-
ber of Rotifera of the samples are shown in figure 1 for the
three collection stations.

The rotifers showed a higher abundance in the low-wa-
ter phase, especially the following species: Asplanchna brightwelli
Gosse, 1850; Asplanchna sieboldi (Leydig, 1854); Brachionus
calicyflorus anuraeformis, Filinia longiseta (Ehrenberg, 1834);
Filinia terminalis (Ehrenberg, 1834), Filinia opoliensis (Zacharias,
1898), Keratella cochlearis Plate, 1886, and Keratella cochlearis
hispida Lauterborn, 1900 (Tab. III).

Figures 2 and 3 show the Pearson correlations that were
significant (p &amp;lt;0.05) between the environmental variables and
density of the rotifers. Both correlations were negative. There
was a correlation with electrical conductivity (r = –0.8824;
p &amp;lt;0.05) in the low-water phase, while this group showed a
correlation with depth (r = –0.7513; p &amp;lt;0.05) in the high-wa-
ter phase. Therefore, rotifer abundance was influenced by lim-
nological factors.

Variance analysis and comparison of means of the roti-
fer and environmental variables in the low-water phase/1997
and water-high phase/1998 are in table IV.

DISCUSSION

Habitat selection is one of the most poorly understood
ecological processes. The question is the following: What ele-
ments of the habitat do animals recognize as relevant? We de-
fine a habitat as any part of the biosphere where a particular

species can live, either temporarily or permanently. Habitat
selection is a process that operates at the level of the individual
animal (KREBS 2001). The hydrologic complex that is the Ama-
zon basin is formed by thousands of small rivers and probably
has been, together with the exuberant forest, in dynamic equi-
librium (SALATI et al. 1978). Mature (old) rivers that flow across
plains and that have already reached their base level (limit
below which erosion by flowing waters cannot occur) have a

sinuous appearance. The snaking stretches of these rivers are
called meanders. In general, a large number of lakes are found
along side of meander rivers. These lakes are formed by the
isolation of meanders through processes of erosion and sedi-
mentation of the banks. The lakes thus formed are so-called
horseshoe, or meander lakes and are probably the most com-
mon lakes in Brazil. They are also called oxbow lakes and are
numerous in the Amazonian region, because this region has
few elevations and a large number of meandering rivers, thereby
offering conditions favoring the formation of inumerous horse-
shoe lakes. Also, components of the landscape surrounding a
lake, stream or river can have a strong influence on water qual-
ity. Elements of the landscape may serve as sources, sinks, or
transformers for nutrients. Moreover, biotic factors such as
vegetation cover, which play a decisive role in the decomposi-
tion of organic litter, determine the types of running waters in
Amazonia (SIOLI 1984, ESTEVES 1998, TURNER 1998).

Lago Amapá is one of these environments, which receives
water from the Rio Acre during some months of the year. In
Lago Amapá, as the hydrographic level increased with the en-
trance of water from the Rio Acre, as of January 19, 1998, only
a few rotifer species appeared, such as Brachionus calicyflorus

anuraeformis, Lecane leontina, Lecane ludwigi. Despite the changes
caused by the increase in hydrographic levels, these were mod-
est in relation to ecosystems of other floodplains, possibly ex-
plained by the meander form of the lake in study. However,
some studies of floodplains have attributed the increase in
zooplanktonic diversity to an increase in the hydrographic lev-
els (HARDY 1980, KOSTE &amp;amp; ROBERTSON 1983, HARDY et al. 1984,
CORRALES DE JACOBO &amp;amp; FRUTOS 1985, BONECKER et al. 1994, BONECKER
&amp;amp; LANSAC-TÔHA 1994). Probably, lakes formed from meanders
favor the deposit of large amounts of clay, derived from ero-
sion and sedimentation along the banks of the lake. These lakes
would differ from other existing lakes in the floodplain of the
Amazonian Basin and the Paraná, influencing then the exist-
ing diversity in this environment. The erosion mechanisms,
especially at the time of the full one, modify the pH of the
water making it acid and hindering the development of cer-
tain species. Concomitantly, electrical conductivity was also
altered, as a variable that correlates with pH, which in the
present study was found to be negatively correlated with abun-
dance of rotifers.

Generally, rotifers showed a planktonic character, possi-
bly due the almost total absence of aquatic macrophytes, which

function as a niche for shore-inhabiting species. The process
of soil erosion along the banks made it difficult for the estab-
lishment of littoral species. However the shore-inhabiting
Lecanideae family had the the largest number of representa-
tives. The family most frequently observed in our study was
Brachionidae, followed by the Lecanidae family which is pre-
dominant in typically tropical environments. These families
had also been found to be dominant in the studies of CARVALHO
(1983). Similarly, they were found to be abundant in aquatic
environments of the Amazônia.

In relation to the composition of the zooplanktonic com-
munity, the number of taxons (48) found in Lago Amapá can
be related to the diversification of niches present in each phase
of the hydrologic cycle, and to the absence of aquatic plants.
This number is low compared to the diversity reported for other
basins and other floodplain lakes. ROBERTSON &amp;amp; HARDY (1984),
reporting on Amazonian data, estimated 250 species of roti-

fers. According to ROCHA et al. (1994) the Amazonian basin has
a greater diversity of zooplankton (Rotifera + Cladocera +
Copepoda), with 268 Rotifera, than do the basins of the
Paraguai, Paraná and São Francisco. The high number of tax-
ons registered for the rotifers (48), compares with the date of
SENDACZ &amp;amp; MELO-COSTA (1991), who described the presence of
Cladocera and Copepoda also in this lake and Lago Novo
Andirá, in relation to the other groups of zooplankton in the
neotropical region. This is also in line with that observed by
various authors who have studied the floodplains of Amazonia
(HARDY 1980, KOSTE &amp;amp; ROBERTSON 1983, HARDY et al. 1984, BOZELLI
1992, KOSTE &amp;amp; ROBERTSON 1998) and other floodplains (JOSE DE
PAGGI 1981, CORRALES DE JACOBO &amp;amp; FRUTOS 1985). Still in accor-
dance with this last author, the high number of taxons regis-
tered for rotifers in floodplains is supported by, among other
factors, the heterogeneity of environments present. Therefore,
this lake was not favorable due to this factor, accounting for

the low number of taxons present. The larger abundance of
rotifers during the low-water period demonstrated that the fluc-
tuation in water level had influenced this group more. This
factor also was observed by HARDY (1980) and LANSAC-TÔHA et al.
(1993), possibly due to increased food availability. Therefore,
dilution caused by high water affects food availability. Accord-
ing to KITCHELL (1998), food is a prime factor for non-photo-
synthetic organisms.

There was a low degree of rotifer diversity in the envi-
ronment studied. The presence and success of an organism or
group of organisms depend on a combination of conditions.
Any condition that approximates or exceeds the limits of tol-
erance is said to be a limiting condition or limiting factor.
Combining the idea of the minimum and the concept of the
tolerance limits it is arrived the most general and useful con-
cept of the limiting factors. Thus, organisms are controled in
nature by (1) the quantity and variability of materials for which
there are minimum requirements, and also critical physical
factors, and (2) the tolerance limits of the organisms them-
selves to these and other components of the environment. Of
the total number of species in a trophic component, or in a
community taken as a whole, a relatively small percentage is
as a rule abundant (represented by large numbers of individu-
als, a large biomass or productivity, or any other indication of
impact, and a large percentage are rare (with small impact val-
ues). While only a few common and dominant species con-
tribute largely to the energy flow in each trophic group, it is
the large number of rare species that determines essentially
species diversity at trophic levels of communities taken as a
whole. The ratios between the number of species and the im-
pact values (numbers, biomass, productivity, and so forth) for
the individuals are designated by species diversity indices. The
diversity of species tends to be small in ecosystems controled
physically (that is, subjected to strong, physical and chemical
limiting factors) and high in ecosystems controled biologically.
Communities in stable environments, such as tropical
rainforests, have a greater species diversity than communities
subjected to perturbations or cycles by human or naturals
causes. Tropical waters of little depth is one factor that dimin-
ishes diversity in a habitat (ODUM 2001). The lake studied had
a maximum depth of 3.4 m, contributing one more factor lim-
iting diversity. In addition to data on diversity, the present
study also demonstrated that the abundance of rotifers corre-
lated negatively with depth.

A significant difference between the means was observed
only using the F test, when examining the seasonality for trans-
parency and pH. The results for temperature, electric conduc-
tivity and dissolved oxygen versus the presence of Rotifera
demonstrated a low degree of seasonal variation in this study
in contrast to that reported by CAMARGO &amp;amp; ESTEVES (1995). These
authors found that in the oxbow lake of Rio Mogi-Guaçu in
São Paulo, a high degree of seasonal variation in the results for
these parameters as a result of the pulse of flooding. However,

SCHMIDT (1973) also did not observe great seasonal variations,
when studying such parameters in Lago Castanho in Central
Amazonia. Temperature remained practically constant during
the entire period of the hydrologic cycle, according to SIOLI
(1984), water temperature, running in an equatorial lowland
where temperature fluctuations are minimal, the waters of the
Amazon have a surprisingly constant temperature, and consti-
tute the most thermally stable waters on earth. THOMAZ et al.
(1997) also observed a constant water temperature in the flood-
plain of the Rio Paraná, which was characterized by small secu-
lar oscillations, except for the occurrence of a small increase in
the high-water phase. Some taxons appeared in Lago Amapá
at basic or neutral pH and relatively low dissolved oxygen lev-
els, such as Platyas quadricornis, Lepadella ovalis, Trichocerca
similis and Testudinella patina. Therefore, these factors are not
considered limiting for these species in the lake studied. How-
ever, according to KITCHELL (1998), just as oxygen concentra-
tion often is an important constraint for aquatic organisms,
especially animails.

Lago Amapá is also being subjected to human activiy
resulting from pollution. Human changes in land use have
greatly increased the amounts of nutrients and silt that enter
lakes. Most increases in nutrient flow can be linked to urban
run-off through storm water systems, effluent from sewage
treatment plants, failing septic systems, agricultural run-off,
deforestation, and nutrient-rich waste waters from industries
such as food processing. The distribution of many species can
be affected by human-mediated changes in habitats. Human
changes to landscapes and environments may make some habi-
tat selection maladaptative (PERRY &amp;amp; VANDERKLEIN 1996, KREBS
2001), interfering with the diversity of species.

Asplanchna was an abundant genus in Lago Amapá. Ac-
cording to MARGALEF (1983), it is a predador organism, ingest-
ing large and mobile algae, as well as other smaller zooplank-
tonic organisms. The degree of predation affects greatly the
diversity of populations or of prey. A moderate predation of-
ten reduces the density of dominant species, thereby provid-
ing less competitive species increased opportunities to utilize
space and resources. The presence of predators may limit the
geographic distribution of many species. Predator limitations
on prey distribution often operate on a local scale. Prey rarely
limit the distribution of their predators (ODUM 2001, KREBS
2001). The establishment of these organisms in the lake stud-
ied was propitious, since the algae present in Lago Amapá were
mostly large ( &gt; 15 µm), in addition to being abundant, and of
the filamentous type, for example the blue-green algae cyano-
phyceae (KEPPELER et al. 1999a,b; KEPPELER &amp;amp; HARDY 2002). Chloro-
phyceae are common in Lago Amapá (KEPPELER et al. 1999b),
which favor the presence of species of the genus Brachionus,
abundant in Lago Amapá. HU et al. (2002), who studied the
rotifer Brachionus angularis, observed that there were very sig-
nificant effects of food concentrations on population growth
rate, body size and egg size in this species when Chlorella pyrenoi-

dosa was used as food. A study by LUCIA-PAVON et al. (2001) also
showed that different densities of live and dead Chlorella vul-
garis affected the population growth of the rotifers Brachionus
calyciflorus and Brachionus patulus (Platyonus patulus).

The communities in rigorous environments should vary
in diversity in accordance with their relative abundance com-
ponent, while diversity in non rigorous environments (bio-
logically controled) should depend on the number of species.
