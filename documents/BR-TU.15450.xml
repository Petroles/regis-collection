Abstract – This study investigated the genetic variability in progenies of Eucalyptus dunnii Maiden for resistance against rust (Puccinia 
psidii). Field experiments were installed in two regions with different soil-climatic conditions. Open-pollinated progenies were established 
in a randomized complete block design. Sixty and 48 progenies were evaluated under field conditions at two sites, respectively, with six 
replications and eight trees per plot. In another experiment in a controlled environment, 53 progenies were evaluated in randomized 
blocks with six replications and nine plants per plot. The following traits were evaluated: plant height, severity of pest attack and the 
most susceptible stage to the leaf disease. The genetic variability for rust resistance in the E. dunnii population under study was high, 
with a genetic coefficient of variation of 36.07%; 7% of the evaluated progenies were rust-resistant. It indicates a high potential for 
selection and breeding of the species.
Key words: Eucalyptus, genetic parameters, progeny testing, forest breeding.

INTRODUCTION
Brazil is one of the world’s largest producers of Euca-

lyptus wood. The share of the forest sector in the national 
economy, which has a participation of approximately 4.5% 
of GDP, clearly shows the importance of this genus for the 
country is grown on an area of   6.5 million hectares and 
generates about 4.73 million jobs (ABRAF 2012).

With the expansion of eucalyptus cultivation to warmer 
and more humid regions and with the impact of climate 
changes, conditions have become favorable for the occur-
rence of diseases (Telechea et al. 2003, Glen et al. 2007). 
Consequently, the planting of susceptible species and the 
uninterrupted use of the same cultivation areas increase the 
chances of pest attacks.

One of the major diseases of Eucalyptus today is rust. 
The economic problems resulting from rust are related to 
planting in the field (Ferreira 1983), where fungicide treat-
ments are practically unfeasible. The vegetative growth 
of Eucalyptus grandis trees infected with this pathogenic 
fungus can be reduced by 28% to 35%, compared to unaf-

fected plants, resulting in direct losses in productivity and 
economic gains.

Nowadays, several forms of rust control are being applied, 
for example: fungicide treatment, tree harvest for regrowth 
in disease-unfavorable seasons and cultivation of resistant 
plants. For a number of reasons, the use of resistant variet-
ies is the most indicated measure: it is cheap, practical and 
has less environmental impacts for requiring less fungicide 
application (Carvalho et al. 1998.).

Resistant plants can be selected in the field in progeny 
and clonal tests (Zobel and Talbert 1984, Alfenas et al. 2004, 
Teixeira et al. 2009), in areas where the disease is severe, 
endemic or even by infection through artificial inoculation 
in a controlled environment (Xavier et al. 2001).

A series of studies on rust have been conducted for the 
genus Eucalyptus (Dianese et al. 1984, Freeman et al. 2008, 
Zauza et al. 2010, Miranda et al. 2013, Silva et al. 2013) in 
view of the great commercial importance for the country. 
However, there are few reports in the literature about the 
disease in the species Eucalyptus dunnii Maiden, although

CS Pinto et al.

the occurrence of the disease in the field has been observed. 
Therefore, this study evaluated the genetic variability in E. 
dunnii progenies for rust resistance caused by Puccinia psidii.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Two trials of E. dunnii open-pollinated progenies were 

set up in the field (Itapetininga and Itatinga, SP, see Table 
1), in July 2009. The trials were arranged in a randomized 
block design with 60 and 48 progenies, both with eight 
plants per plot with six replications, in a 3 x 2 m spacing The 
trial into the controlled environment (inoculation chamber) 
was carried out in the Department of Crop Science in the 
Sector of Plant Protection and Plant Breeding of São Paulo 
State University (UNESP), in Botucatu, SP, Brazil, by the 
randomized blocks with 53 progenies, with nine plants per 
plot and six replications, totalizing 2,544 plants. The total 
used progenies in the controlled environment trial, 48 were 
set up at Itapetininga, and all of 53 were at Itatinga.

Inoculation was performed with an uredospore solution 
of P. psidii from plants of a spontaneously infected rose 
apple (Syzygium jambos) tree, in a controlled environment. 
The spores were scraped from the leaves with a stylus and 
suspended in distilled water plus Tween 20% to reach a 
concentration of 9 x 104 spores mL-1. The suspension was 
sprayed on all plants with an air compressor (Chiaperini® 
2,3pcm, Model E48C) to ensure an even distribution of 
the spore suspension. The test temperature was maintained 
at 22 °C, the average relative humidity was 80% and the 
photoperiod 12 hours, for 15 days, until evaluations.

The following characteristics were evaluated in progeny 
field trials: tree height (H) and severity of fungal attack, to 
correlate the attack intensity with the development of the 
progenies. Evaluations were performed every three months 
for severity, with four assessments, and every six months 
for height, with two evaluations. Data on the severity of rust 
attack were collected in the field, based on grade criteria from 
0 to 4, where: 0 - resistant plant; 1 - sporadic sporulation; 
2 - generalized sporulation, but no apparent damage to the 
plant; 3 - generalized sporulation on leaves and branches, 
causing major damage and 4 - advanced disease, with loss 
of apical dominance. To determine resistance levels in E. 

dunnii progenies we used a grade scale adapted by Aparecido 
et al. (2003), and the data were previously transformed to 

5.0+x .

The genetic parameters for each individual test were 
estimated using the program SELEGEN (Resende 2007) 
model 93, by the statistical model: y = Xr + Za +  Wp + e, 
where y is the data vector, r the vector of effects of repli-
cations (assumed as fixed) added to the overall mean, a is 
the vector of individual additive genetic effects (assumed 
as random), p is the vector of plot effects (random) and 
e is the error or residue vector (random). Capital letters 
represent the incidence matrices for these effects. X, Z and 
W are known incidence matrices formed by the values zero 
and one, which associate the unknown r, a and p to the data 
vector y, respectively. By the mixed model methodology r 
can be estimated by the generalized least square procedure 
and predict a and p by the BLUP procedure. The REML 
procedure (method of maximum likelihood) was performed 
based on Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms, 
where the resolutions of the matrices provide estimates of 
adjusted effects of the calculated vectors. The following 
genetic parameters were estimated:

a) Additive genetic variance (?? 2a)

b) Environmental variance between plots (?? 2c)

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The coefficient of experimental variation for rust re-

sistance was 19.2%, 15.7% and 18.9%, in the three trials, 
respectively (Table 2). These values   indicate good experi-
mental accuracy for field trials and controlled environments 
in species of the genus Eucalyptus (Garcia 1989).

The values   of the estimates for individual narrow-sense 
heritability were moderate (h? 2a = 0.48 and 0.37) and high 

for mean progeny heritability (h? 2m = 0.84 and 0.64) into the 
inoculation chamber and in Itapetininga trial, indicating low 
influence of the environment on the rust resistence (Resende 
2007). The values   were similar to those reported by Mori et 
al. (2004) for rust resistance in E. grandis progenies under 
field conditions.

In the region of Itatinga, heritability was generally low, 
indicating the influence of environmental factors on trait 
expression. In the case of rust resistance, this can be influ-
enced by the low availability of inoculum in the environment.

In general, estimates of the coefficient of individual ge-
netic variation (CVgi) were higher than the variation among 
progenies (CVgp) for rust resistance. Lowest values of CVgi 
(2.1%) and CVgp (1.0%) were observed for rust severity in 
the Itatinga field trial, and highest values of CVgi  (36.1%) 
and CVgp (18.0%) were found in the progeny trial in the 
inoculation chamber. The high CVgi values show possi-
bilities for selection in breeding programs. Miranda et al. 
(2013) found very similar CVgi values (11.7% - 36.7%) for 
Eucapyptus grandis by nine different locations.

The relative coefficients of variation (CVr) were low, 
medium and high, in the experiments in Itatinga, Itapetin-
inga, and the controlled environment, respectively (Table 
2). According to Vencovsky and Barriga (1992), the higher 
the CVr value, the greater is the genetic control of traits 
and the lower is the influence by environmental factors, 
favoring selection.

The experimental coefficient of variation (CVexp) for H 
(Table 3), evaluated after six and 12 months, was high in 
both field trialts. The highest CVexp values   were found in 
Itapetining (19% after 6 months and 21.7% after 12 months). 
In Itatinga, CVexp was adequate (15.2% after 6 months and 
14.3% after 12 months), which is close to values found in

the literature (Santos et al. 2004, Souza et al. 2011).

The heritability at the individual plant level, in the narrow 
sense (h? 2a) was low for H in Itapetininga (0.10 ± 0.04 after 6 
months and 0.07 ± 0.03 after 12 months) and high in Itatinga 
trial (0.60 ± 0.09 after six months and 0.58 ± 0.09 after 12 
months). This may indicate that about 90% of the variation 
in Itapetininga and 40% in Itatinga may be induced by the 
environment. The h? 2a values   found in Itatinga, at the two 
ages for H, were higher than values   found in the literature 
(Rocha et al. 2007, Rosado et al. 2009), in their studies with 
E. urophylla. For mean progeny heritability (h? 2mp), the high-
est values   found for Itatinga show that the environment had 
little influence on the phenotypic expression of H.

The coefficients of individual genetic variation (CVgi 
%) were higher than those of genetic variation of progenies 
(CVgp %) in both experiments and at both ages. In the tests, 
CVgi % varied from 9.8% for Itapetininga/SP, after 12 
months, to 26.7% for Itatinga/SP after 6 months. The same 
trend was found for CVgp %. The results show the genetic 
variability for the trait ALT, under the experimental condi-
tions of the study site.

The coefficients of relative variation (CVr) were high in 
Itatinga, with an approximate value of 0.87, at both ages. In 
Itapetining however, the values   were close to 0.27,   similar 
to the values found for open-pollinated progenies of E. 
urophylla (CVr =0.21) after 17 years for plant height, in

Genetic variability in progenies of Eucalyptus dunnii Maiden for resistance to Puccinia psidii

Selvíria, MS (Souza et al. 2011). According to Vencovsky 
and Barriga (1992), these values   are considered low. The 
low CVr values indicate that the genetic control of the trait 
is low and highly influenced by the environment. Accord-
ing to Vencovsky (1978), the CVr estimates close to 1 are 
recommendable.

The genetic and phenotypic correlations are presented 
in Table 4. The correlations were highest for the character 
height (H), between different ages in the same environment. 
The high values   show that the performance of the genotypes 
does not vary with increasing age. This behavior is important 
in the case of early selection.

For rust, the highest correlation was found between 
Itapetininga and inoculation chamber, where a genetic cor-
relation (rg) of 0.50 was observed. However, the same was 
not true for the phenotypic correlation (rf), where a value 
of 0.04 was calculated. When progeny performance, tree 
height, and rust susceptibility were correlated, the values   
were very low, indicating that the poor performance of the 
plant material had no influence on rust attack. This may 
have occurred because of the low rust-susceptibility of the 
species, or to the low availability of inoculum in the area of 
the field trials. In general, the correlations found in this study 
were low, hampering indirect selection for the studied traits.

The estimates of genetic parameters in the combined 
analysis for rust in all three environments in pairwise analysis 
(controlled environment/Itapetininga, controlled environ-
ment/Itatinga and Itapetininga/Itatinga) and for the trait 
plant height in Itapetininga/Itatinga are shown in Table 5.

The combined analysis showed mean and low values   for 
heritability. The values   were highest in the analysis between 
tests of inoculation chamber and Itapetininga. The lowest 
values on the other hand   were observed in the combined 
analysis of the two field tests for rust resistance.

The genotypes x environments (GE) interactions were 

high in the rust analysis in three environments, between the 
test controlled environment/Itapetininga and at both ages 
for plant height. This shows the presence of a complex 
GE interaction. In this case, the decision on selection is 
more difficult, since the selection of genotypes adapted to 
specific environments is required. Miranda et al. (2013) 
observed strong genetic control associated with rust resis-
tance between provenances of E. grandis. For resistance 
in interspecific Eucalyptus hybrids to P. psidii, Alves et 
al. (2012) observed that quantitative additive and epistatic 
trait loci explain between 29.8 and 44.8% of the phenotypic 
variation, respectively. This is evidence of a more complex 
inheritance pattern of the trait. The genotypic correlation 
between the progeny performance in various environments 
(r?gloc= 0.21) was considered low. Still, this interaction could 
be exploited in a positive way in breeding programs since 
it allows directing a particular genotype towards a specific 
region, maximizing the phenotypic trait expression in this 
environment. However, if the genotype is directed towards 
another region, its phenotypic value might be reduced.

In summary, this study shows the great potential of the 
studied populations of E. dunnii for selection and breeding, 
with a view to rust resistance, since 70% of the progenies 
obtained grade zero (resistant plants) and the genetic vari-
ability for rust resistance in the studied population was good 
(CVgi = 36.07%). The genetic correlation between the test 
in the controlled environment and field test in Itapetininga 
was also good (rg = 0.50); this shows that the controlled 
environment is a good alternative for early selection of 
plant material for rust resistance to obtain progress in the E. 
dunnii breeding program for rust. It is noteworthy that the 
genetic correlation between the controlled environment and 
Itatinga (CI/R2) is zero, which prevents a selection under 
controlled conditions for response to selection in Itatinga. 
Even the field data showed no genotypic correlation between 
Itatinga and Itapetininga.

Variabilidade genética em progênies de Eucalyptus dunnii Maiden para 
resistência à Puccinia psidii
Resumo – Avaliou-se a variabilidade genética em progênies de Eucalyptus dunnii Maiden para resistência à ferrugem (Puccinia psidii). 
Experimentos de campo foram instalados em duas regiões edafoclimáticas. Progênies de polinização aberta foram estabelecidas em um 
delineamento em blocos casualizados. Em condições de campo foram avaliadas 60 e 48 progênies em dois locais, com seis repetições 
e oito plantas por parcela. Instalou-se também um experimento em ambiente controlado, com 53 progênies, em blocos casualizados, 
com seis repetições e nove plantas por parcela. Foram avaliadas altura da planta e a severidade de ataque que determinam a fase 
mais suscetível à doença foliar. A população de E. dunnii estudada apresentou alta variabilidade genética para resistência à ferrugem, 
com coeficiente de variação genética de 36,07% e 70% das progênies avaliadas foram imunes a ferrugem. Isto indica alto potencial 
para seleção e melhoramento da espécie.
Palavras-chave: Eucalyptus, parâmetros genético, teste de progênies, melhoramento genético florestal.
