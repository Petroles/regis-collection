Abstract 

My dissertation is an analysis for Petrofac which is a leading service provider to the oil and gas 

production and processing industry. The aim of this dissertation is to value the company and 

give a BUY or SELL or HOLD recommendation. The dissertation starts with a company 

overview, and I analyze it from the overall economics, industry and the Petrofac’s financial 

statement.  The projection is based on the macroeconomics, industry and the Petrofac’s 

development goal. The valuation in the final part is based on the projection by using Discount 

Dividend Model, Discount Cash Model and Abnormal Earnings Model. The final conclusion 

of the share price is given as BUY.

In order to fit the new group organizational structure, the reporting segments have been 

rearranged to: Engineering &amp;amp; Construction, Engineering &amp;amp; Production Services and Integrated 

Energy Services. The trading results are monitored separately to assess their performance and 

decide the resource allocation. As we can see from the Table 2, the major revenues arose from 

the Engineering &amp;amp; Construction segment (2016: US$5,928 million)

Table 3 Board 

The board is the core of the corporate governance, the effectiveness of the board impacts the 

business performance and the equity of shareholders. The board of Petrofac will be analyzed 

from 5 different factors as following.

2002

Company Overview

The first factor is the size of board, Lipton and Lorsch (1992) put forward that the lack of 

meaningful discussions because of the size of board, which should be limited with a maximum 

of 10 members. However, if the size of the board is too small, it will limit the viewpoints. 

Conversely, the members in a big size board have difficulties to communicate with each other 

in a limited time. The board of Petrofac consists of a non-executive chairman, group chief 

executive, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, senior independent director and four 

non-executive directors. This 8-member board allows directors to know each other well and 

have effective meetings. 

 

The second factor is the frequency of meetings. The strategy making, supervision of 

management and other relative activities from the board are through board meetings. According 

to Korn and Ferry’s survey (1992), the directors would be expected to spend at least 94 hours 

on board-related business. In Petrofac, besides six scheduled face-to-face meetings, the board 

also communicates via telephone conferences. Additionally, face-to-face meeting were held in 

the form of a two-day conference. Lipton and Lorsch (1992) also suggest additional meetings 

resulting in salutary effects.

Third, the separation of management and control can help to improve the problem of power, 

when everything is concentrated on the chairman or CEO. The chairman of Petrofac (Rijnhard 

van Tets) is responsible for leading the board and ensuring the effective board governance and 

represents the shareholders’ equity. The CEO of Petrofac is Ayman Asfari, who is responsible 

for leading and motivating management team. In addition, Ayman Asfari is the major 

shareholder with 62,958,426 shares (18.2%, Table 4). Therefore, Ayman as a major shareholder 

and the CEO, has the same goal with the chairman to improve the business performance and 

maximize the equity of shareholders.

Table 4 Major Shareholders - taken from Petrofac Annual Report 2016 

Fourth, the intensive plan for the board is an effective way to improve business performance. 

The major shareholders can focus on the long-term development, and avoid the short-term 

decision. The intensive plans are divided into cash and shares. Petrofac has Annual Bonus and 

Performance Share Plans. The award from Annual Bonus is based on the performance in the 

relevant financial year, which can be up to 200% of the basic salary. The Performance Share 

Plan strengthens Executive Directors’ performance over the long-run and usually rewards 

conditional shares. This is in line with the target about the long-term strategy of company and 

alignment with long-run shareholder value. 

 

Finally, the role of the Independent Director will be analyzed. According to NASDAQ Rule 

4200 a(15): “Independent Director means a person other than an executive officer or employee 

of the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the issuer's 

board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out 

the responsibilities of a director” (Security and Exchange Commission, 2017). Thomas Thune 

Andersen has extensive international experience with well-established knowledge of the energy 

industry and the market. Andrea Abt, René Médori and George Pierson are non-executive 

Independent Director of the company. While Andrea has a good understand in sales, finance, 

procurement and logistics; René has a wide-ranging international financial experience with 

strong background in governance, operational and strategic management. George is a lawyer 

and engineer with strong background in risk management, contracting, construction law, 

compliance and cost efficiency. As the results from Dahya &amp;amp; McConnel’s study indicate that 

there is a significant positive correlation between the representation of independent director and 

the board decision. The four Independent Directors are specialists in finance, law, management 

respectively, therefore, they can provide advices from different areas, which can lead to an 

improvement in business performance and ensures that no single individual can dominate the 

decision-making process.

An integrated service is provided by IES for clients, which includes the greenfield and 

brownfield, energy infrastructure projects and investments. Under a range of commercial 

models Petrofac is able to meet client requirements. This service is composed of Production 

Enhancement Contracts (PECs), Risk Service Contracts (RSCs), and Traditional Equity 

Upstream Investment models. The lower production and the lower oil and gas prices brought a 

decline in revenue in 2016 combined with a net loss of US$42 million.

2 Economic Analysis 

As we can see from Section 1.2, Petrofac is a diverse company with business operations in the 

Middle East, Africa, Europe, Americas, Asia Pacific, India and CIS. The main corporate office 

is in London and the Middle East is their key operation region. The transaction currency of 

Petrofac is U.S. dollar, since the commodity is traded in this currency. The UK and Middle East 

economy will be discussed in this part as well as the U.S. economy. 

2.1 General Economic 

Real GDP Worldwide 

 

Image taken from: World Bank 

The global growth in terms of Real GDP is predicted to accelerate to 2.7% in 2017 and 2.9% 

in 2018-2019. As we can see from the Table above, the World Real GDP in 2016 anticipated 

to fall from 2.7% (2015) to 2.4% which is in line with the January 2017 projections. The 

advanced economic growth has decreased by 0.4% from 2.1% (2015) to 1.7% (2016) while the 

growth in EMDEs is projected to accelerate to 4.1% in 2017, up from 3.5% in 2016, before 

strengthening further to 4.5% and 4.7% in 2018-2019. 

As predicted in January, the global activity is picking up and the global growth is expected to 

strengthen in 2017.

However, according to the world bank report, risk to the global outlook remain titled to the 

downside, which is caused by the increase in the uncertainty of advanced economic policy, 

elevated trade protectionism and the possibility of financial market disruptions. Those factors 

may cause a weaker potential global growth in the long-run. 

2.2 Major Economy 

The activities in major advanced economies could lead to stronger than expected impacts to the 

global outlook, notably in the U.S. 

In the 19th century, the UK was the economic superpower in the world, its trading partners 

suffered indirect losses when it was involved in a financial crisis. Until the 20th century, the UK 

lost his position and the U.S. has become the largest economy measured by the nominal GDP 

($16.58 trillion) which accounts for 24.68% of gross world product in 2016. Figure 4 shows 

that China performs better than the U.S. measured in terms of GDP based on PPP after 2013 – 

approximately $21,269 billion in China compared to $18,562 billion in the U.S.

First of all, the U.S. has been the leader in the world economic development. The data in Figure 

5 is provided from the World Bank from 2000 to 2016 and shows the percentages of the U.S. 

of the world GDP. The average value for U.S. during this period is around 26.12%. The 

minimum value is 21.55% in 2011 while the maximum is 32.46% in 2001. It indicates that the 

U.S. GDP is the major part of the global GDP. This means if the U.S. is hit by an economic 

slowdown world GDP will decrease significantly. This can be shown on the example of the 

Subprime Mortgage Crisis. A Subprime Mortgage is a type of mortgage which is issued by 

lending institutions to low credit borrowers. According to Amadeo (2017), this crisis started in 

the late 2006 and peaking in 2009. The main reason is banks sold too many mortgages to 

borrowers with low credit ratings, the falling home prices occurred with defaults. In the

Secondly, the U.S. implements the trade liberalization policy which leads to global integration. 

In addition, there is a board economic link between the U.S. and the rest of the world. According 

to the Economic Complexity Index (ECI), the United States is the 2nd largest export economy 

with $1.38T and largest importer with $2.16T in the world (see Figure 6). As a result, a negative 

impact from the U.S. economy can easily spread out to the world through the interactions in 

trade, financial, monetary, investment, confidence and policy channel. The main cause is the 

import and export trade. When the U.S. is experiencing a recession, there should be a receding 

in consumption of residents, the capital expenditure and production of companies, which leads 

to a reduce in imports about consumer goods, capital goods, intermediate product and raw 

materials. The imports of the U.S. are the exports of other countries. Therefore, a decrease in 

global trade will result in a global economic downturn.

According to Figure 7, it can be known that China is the top import origins of the U.S. with 

$457 Billion. The reduction of consumption from U.S. residents will directly affect the export 

of consumer goods from China to U.S. As a result, exporting Chinese companies will reduce 

their production and lay off employees.

Third, the U.S. dollar is the benchmark pricing instrument for most commodities in 

international trade. Foreign traders purchase or sell goods with dollars. According to the data 

released by International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the end of March 2017, more than half 

(63.96%) of all known central bank foreign currency reserves were denominated in U.S. dollars. 

The following one is Euros, which makes up 19.74% of currency reserves (Figure 8).

Figure 8 World – Allocated Reserves by Currency for 2016Q4

The reason why foreign holders prefer U.S. banknotes is because of the monetary stability. 

Goldberg (2010, p2-3) mentioned that the U.S. dollar stipulates an improved medium of 

exchange relative to their home currency. However, countries might suffer massive wealth 

destruction, because of the depreciation of the U.S. dollar and even might lead to a global 

deflation. The benefit derived by dollar weakness is the increase of export competitiveness of 

U.S., but it is bad news for the import origins of U.S. and the data mentioned before proved that 

the U.S. is a powerful importer. Their home currencies appreciated against U.S. dollar that 

means there will be a lower export competitiveness of their commodities due to the increasing 

price, which affect the development of economy in export countries directly. 

2.3 Other indicators 

Inflation 

The inflation rate in February 2017 is around 2% within advanced economies, which is more 

than double the rate compared to 2016 (0.8%), with a revival within emerging market driven 

by the increase in fuel prices (IMF, 2017). The main reason behind this is that the increased oil 

price between August 2016 and February 2017, with growth rates up to 20%., caused by the 

production cut agreement from the OPEC. In most advanced economies, headline inflation 

remains below central bank targets and the core inflation has been stable. It has remained

broadly stable in emerging economies, whereas Brazil and Russia, experiencing a strong 

decline. 

Labor Market 

10 years after the global financial crisis, the OECD average employment rate reached pre-crisis 

levels in the Q1 of 2017 and the unemployment rate continues to improve. But unemployment 

is still a little higher compared to pre-crisis, which has resulted from the rising participation 

levels and cannot be offset by employment increasing (DECD, 2017). The real wage growth is 

slow, the unemployment rate still remains high for part-time jobs. All in all, the employment 

indicators are getting better but the whole labor market is still lagging behind. 

Investment, Trade and demand 

Investment and trade are picking up modestly, there are three signals showing the investment 

prospects are good: low policy uncertainties; the regulation will promote competition among 

investors; and the global demand is in uptrend (OECD, 2017). Because of the strong support 

from China, the global trade has rebound in the last year. Investment is suggested to be in a 

high-quality capital with advanced technology, which might improve the global investment 

chains, but requires the high efficient productivity and output. (World Bank, 2017) 

Policy Uncertainty and Geopolitical Risks 

At first, there is a change in the U.S., Trump brings a shock to the fiscal, trade, and immigration 

policies, which affects companies, investments and new hires. On the other side of the Atlantic, 

the Brexit brings risk to the European economy. 

The geopolitical risks in the Middle East might come with a serious problem of oil and gas and 

refugee flows. The food and water shortages also contribute to risk. The reasons presented in 

this Section bring downside risk and heighten the uncertainty in the world economy. 

Middle East and North Africa (MENA) 

A sluggish economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa resulting from the oil 

production cuts and the fiscal consolidation in recent. Because the influence from the oil 

production cuts exceeds the bettering circumstances on oil importers, the MENA’s growth has 

been moderate around 3% during 2015-2016, and is projected to fall to 2.1% in 2017. But the 

growth is expected to increase to 2.9% in 2018, which based on the low geopolitical risk and 

an increasing oil price (World Bank, 2017). After 2017, the oil price is expected to pick up, the 



Economic Analysis   

26 

 

fiscal consolidation is expected to eased, and several public investments (such as Dubai’s World 

Expo 2020) are ongoing (Callen et al. 2014). It can be told from these factors that the GDP 

growth will be remain low in the fiscal year of 2017 and increase thereafter.  

Oil and Gas 

Crude oil price rose 8% in Q1 2017 with the support of OPEC production cuts agreement, the 

gas prices increased 6% in the Q1 2017 on the stronger demand and production restrictions 

(World Bank, 2017). It should be mentioned that the main driver of the price fluctuation are the 

supply and demand dynamics. In the following years, the oil price is projected to increase as 

global supply will fail to satisfy the demand. In the other hand, weaker compliance concerning 

production cuts might affect the supply and demand balance again.

3 Industry Analysis 

In the previous sections, the macro effects have been discussed. In this section, Porter’s Five 

Forces and SWOT analysis will be used to analyze the Oil and Gas Equipment and Services 

Sector. Then, I determine the current stage of Petrofac in industry life cycle as well as the 

macro and micro level of industry. 

 

3.1 Porter’s Five Force Model 

Porter’s Five Forces Model focuses on the industry analysis, which is based on the assumption 

that industries have boundaries. It is a microscopic analysis of the external environment, which 

indicates the average profit margins of a company in the industry. Therefore, it is a 

measurement of industry situation rather than the capacity of a company. Determining which 

market need to be analyzed is the first step. Petrofac is an international company, their projects 

span over 29 countries, so it will be analyzed in a worldwide scope. 

 

3.1.1 Bargaining Power of Buyers 

According to Athanasios Pitatzis (2017), there are different types of buyers – refineries, 

National Oil Companies (NOC), International Oil and Gas Companies, Distribution Companies, 

Traders and Countries (USA, China, Japan, etc.). But all of them are Oil &amp;amp; Gas Companies, 

therefore, the composition of the buyers is single. The business performance of Oil Equipment 

and Services Companies is closely tied to oil and gas companies. Most of the oil and gas 

companies require the strict market access and evaluation system. For these reasons, there is a 

strong bargaining power of buyers in oil equipment and services sector. 

 

3.1.2 Bargaining Power of Suppliers 

The global oil and gas chain can be divided into three parts: Upstream, Mid-Stream and 

Downstream. The whole chain includes designing, building, maintaining facilities; transporting, 

storing, processing oil and gas and refining. 



Industry Analysis   

28

The suppliers in the Oil and Gas Equipment and Services Sector are the suppliers who provide 

the technology and the equipment. There are a large number of the suppliers worldwide who 

have a large impact on the Sector. However, a special phenomenon exists here, many equipment 

and services providers are competitors as well. Valerus Compression Services, L.P., a United 

Stated-based company, is one of the suppliers of Petrofac. At the meantime, this company is 

doing the same things as Petrofac, they provide products and services for oil and gas companies. 

For this type of company, as a competitor, they intended to invest hugely in research and 

development (R&amp;amp;D) in order to improve their competitiveness in the industry; but as a supplier, 

they set strict limits on their equipment and service provision. Due to these factors, the suppliers 

have a greater impact with strong bargaining power in Oil and Gas Equipment and Services 

Sector. 

 

3.1.3 Threat of New Entrants 

As mentioned above, Petrofac is vertical integrated, their business involvement on all of the 

segments of Oil and Gas Value Chain, especially the upstream. And the Oil and Gas Equipment 

and Services Sector can be divided into five different subsectors: Exploration, Drilling, 

Completion, Production and Capital Equipment and Offshore Services. For different subsectors, 

different technology or equipment is required, which requires companies to have relatively 

strong R &amp;amp;D capacity and huge investments. At present, most leading oil service providers have 

a considerable number of patents which reflects its high level of technology. According to a 

research form Espacenet, Schlunberger is the biggest oilfield service company in the world with 

https://www.slideshare.net/theoacheampong/theo-acheampong-presentation


Industry Analysis   

29 

 

more than 36,000 patents. In comparison with Halliburton and Backer Hughes, which have 

25,000 and 20,000 patents. 

Pitatzis, A. (2016) mentioned that most countries have their state-owned national oil and gas 

companies, and these national oil and gas companies control more than 90% of the oil and gas 

reserves. These national companies always have their own cooperative partners, so this is 

another weakness for new entrants. 

In the future, with the entire oil industry transforming from conventional energy to 

unconventional energy, the technical requirements will be higher and more complex. Big oil 

and gas companies have grown significantly in their business life, in the meantime, they 

develop their R&amp;amp;D, improve the technology, which bring a cost advantage to company and 

further strengthen the barriers to new entrants. 

 

3.1.4 Threat of Substitutes 

The main current alternatives for oil and gas are: Nuclear Energy, Coal, Hydrogen, Biofuels 

and other renewables sources (Solar and wind energy). Hence, the alternatives for Oil 

Equipment and Services Company are the companies who provide the service for other energy. 

 

Image taken from: Petrofac Annual Report 2016 

Under the new policies scenario, International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated the world 

primary energy demand by 2040. It can be seen from the Image, the demand for oil will increase 

slightly to 4775 M tone per day. Meanwhile, the gas demand is forecasted to grow by more 

than 50%. It can be said that the renewables energy may not be able to become the main energy 

in the long period. 



Industry Analysis   

30 

 

The Financial Times (2017) reported that in 2015, the last deep-pitcoalmine (Kellingley) in the 

UK was officially closed. The British government also announced in the run-up to the 

December 2015 adoption of the Paris climate change accord that they wanted to phase out coal 

power by 2025. With the increasing of importance of environment, the using of oil and gas have 

been encouraged, the proportion of coal consumption is gradually decreasing whereas the 

proportion of oil and gas consumption is growing. Overall, it seems that there is few threat of 

the substitutes in Oil and Gas Equipment and Services Sector. 

 

3.1.5 Competitive Rivalry 

Oil, equipment and services market is a monopolistic competition market with strong 

competition, due to the large number of segments and the high technical requirements, and the 

different services, products from different companies. For example, some grow up with 

technical advantage, some have a value chain advantage that relies on the vertical integration, 

and some monopoly companies get ahead because of their monopolization. Petrofac is a typical 

vertical integrated company which is involved throughout the value chain, from designing to 

marketing. Services include concluding contracts with the energy end market, helping 

companies to manage the operations based on changing market demands. Less influence from 

the oil price volatilities are brought to bear on Petrofac, because the company can hedge profits 

against declining price by expending the profit margins in refining operations. 

The high exit barrier is another difficult situation for firms. Equipment as the major capital of 

a company whereas R &amp;amp; D expenditure and other intangible assets might be hard to recover 

due to the specification.

3.1.6 Summary of porter’s five model 

 

Figure 9 Porter’s Five Model Result 

Figure 9 represents that the bargaining power of buyers is relatively high as the threat of new 

entrants is low. The high exit barrier and the difficulty recovering the investment lead to a high 

competitive rivalry.

3.2 SWOT Analysis  

3.2.1 Strength  

? As mentioned above, Petrofac is an integrated company, compared to other independent 

company, it can get a balance from upstream and downstream operations to hedge 

profits against the market recessions. 

? With 35-year operating experience, Petrofac has built a strong reputation in the market. 

? A reorganization of Petrofac has been implemented in January 2016, in order to meet 

client requirements from a changing environment, such as the Middle East and North 

Africa. 

? The core value of Petrofac is “SAFE”. The high potential incidents (HiPos) rate has 

fallen from 0.063 (2015) to 0.039 (2016) (Petrofac, Annual report and account 2016, 

p.54) which is an excellent safety record. Petrofac’s performance keeps substantially 

ahead of industry norms. 

? There is a strong risk management system in Petrofac (image shown below). This helps 

the management to seize opportunities despite it operates in a challenging environment.  

 

Image taken from: Petrofac Annual Report 2016 

? With Petrofac operating in 29 countries, the group employs approximately 13,500 staff 

in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Americas, Asia Pacific, India and CIS, even though 

there is a decline in employee numbers in 2016. This strong workforce ensures that the 

group can keep operating even when one region stagnates. 



Industry Analysis   

33 

 

? Oil and Gas Equipment and Services Sector is a technology intensive sector, the 

engineering teams of Petrofac keep finding new techniques to delivery efficiency 

combined with cost optimization. 

3.2.2 Weakness  

? The industry is capital intensive, large amounts of investment are needed at the 

beginning, and it takes a long time to generate profit from the investment. 

? The industry is in close ties with the oil and gas industry, hence there is a strong 

correlation between the performance of IES in Petrofac and oil and gas price volatility. 

Recently the low price and the uncertainty in forward price influence the level of 

investment, development and business activity within the industry. 

? The number of contracts are relatively small with large value in Petrofac, the 

termination of contract will bring a significant impact on financial performance. 

3.2.3 Opportunities 

? As it was mentioned before, the use of coal in the world is declining whereas oil and 

gas as a main energy is encouraged to use. The demand of oil and gas will be 

strengthening further. 

3.2.4 Threats 

? The political risk remains a significant threat in this industry, notably Petrofac which 

has to face possibility of regime change and legal or regulatory changes. Petrofac should 

keep an eye on the Middle East and North Africa because of the exposure to policy 

changes. 

? Until 2015, more than 80% of crude oil reserves are located in OPEC countries, but at 

the end of May 2017, OPEC announced the oil supply cut until March 2018, the OPEC 

and non-OPEC members agree with it (Meredith, 2017). Oil companies are the main 

customer of the industry, the oil supply cut might bring along a declining demand in 

equipment and service industry. 

? A strong international competition exists in this industry. The most market is occupied 

by three major oil equipment and service companies: Schlumberger, Halliburton and 

Baker Hughes, resulting from technical monopoly. 

 



Industry Analysis

3.3 Industry Life Cycle &amp;amp; Macro Economics 

Finch and Acha (2008) suggest that oil related equipment and services are at the mature stage 

of the industry life cycle with mature technology, stable and clear industry competition and user 

characteristic. This sector is a monopolistic competition market with significant high entry 

barriers, and it is getting difficult to develop new technologies. Some large firms dominate most 

of the market, such as Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes, and there is a strong 

competition among the others for the rest of the market. It leads to a situation that all of the end 

products are homogeneous without product differentiation. 

 

There is a strong correlation between the performance of FTSE oil equipment and service sector 

and the price of oil and gas, and the investment of this industry relies on the stable and healthy 

oil &amp;amp; gas prices. The prices are determined by many factors, especially the dynamic relationship 

between the supply and demand. Moreover, there is a long-term inverse relationship between 

crude oil and gas prices and the value of the dollar (Kowalski, 2017). The current spot dollar 

index gradually increased to 96.963 index points (6/26/2017) compared to 80 index points in 

mid-2014 against other foreign exchange instruments. Whereas the crude oil WTI future price 

fell down from $105.37 in June 1,2014 to $43.84 in June 27, 2017 (Investing, 2017)

Oil Gas Sector REAL Price

RG RO RINDEX



Industry Analysis   

35 

 

It can be seen from Figure 10 above, there is a strong positive correlation between the Brent oil 

price, Natural Gas price and the FTSAX0570. This strong correlation further illustrates the 

cyclicality of oil related service and equipment industry – the demand scale and the level of 

investment of oil and gas company will change with the oil and gas price changes, so that the 

oil and gas service industry will adjust their investment appropriately. The period from 2005-

2008 were boom years for the industry, peak price of FTAXS was 19,100.32 GBP on Jun 1st 

2008. From there on the price has fallen sharply and reached a low of 8,568.42 GBP due to the 

global financial crisis of 2008.

Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes are the top three in the industry. The picture 

above presents the WTI oil future price and stocks of the three companies. We can see directly 

that the stock prices are consistent with oil price, and the time when extreme points occurred 

are highly synchronized. Moreover, there were some rebounds recently, the stock prices 

recovered at the same time as the rebound occurred or even early. 

 

Market fundamentals are projected to be robust in the long-term, the energy demand is expected 

to grow by 30% until 2040 because of the new policies scenario - Decarburization (450) 

scenario (Petrofac, 2016). Oil price is set to continue to increase in the coming years, which has 

a positive impact on the equipment and services industry. The investment activity will see an

upturn and the growth in China is set to strengthening further in the second half of 2017. The 

market stability is predicted to increase in line with above factors.

3.4 Correlation with Gas and Oil 

Petrofac provides services to the oil and gas production and processing industry, therefore, the 

gas and oil price will be focused on. From Figure 11 and 12, we can see a significant positive 

correlation. The Sector (FTSAX0570) shows a higher correlation with real crude oil price with 

R² = 0.2530 compared to the gas price with R² = 0.0056. The reaction of industry is broadly in 

line with the trend of the real oil price.

Table 8 Yearly Performance 

The YTD shows that Petrofac has been facing serious issues this year, the investigation brought 

a significant influence to their performance. In 2008, the return in FTSE 250, Sector and 

Petrofac decreased sharply because of the effect of the global financial crisis. And then returned 

back in 2009, which broadly in line with the tentative growth after the crisis. The demand from

emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) such as China and India was 

strengthening further in the following years. After the Brexit and UK election on 8th Jun, the 

FTSE 250 has shown a 6.91% YTD performance which substantially ahead of Petrofac and the 

Sector with a positive translation impact in the constituents of FTSE 250. This implies that most 

of the constituents are holding dollar instead of sterling and the effects from the Brexit and the 

election strengthen the dollar and weaken the sterling. 

 

4.1 Return 

Data which used to analysis the Beta and Return is from investing.com and Thompson Reuters. 

The 5-year monthly historic price was used to calculate the return. For beta calculation, the 

prices of FTSE 250 and Petrofac will be assumed as normal distributed. 

 

4.1.1 FTSE 250 (Market) Return  

The Table and Figure present the monthly performance for FTSE 250 in the recent 5 years. The 

frequency for FTSE 250 return presented in Figure 5 is compared with normal distribution. The 

Excel excess kurtosis is -0.100322 (lower than zero) or platykurtic. This graph shows clearly 

that the skewness is below zero, as the graph skewed to the left.

4.1.3 Conclusion 

It can be seen from the Table 11 that the 5-year monthly return is different from the yearly 

return, as the data used are different. However, both two returns show that Petrofac did not 

performed well in the last 5 years. However, from the monthly returns, we can find that Petrofac 

price is modestly picking up recently.

Figure 17 Re-Based Price 

The daily price in the graph above are all rebased to 100 (on 02/07/2012). And from this graph 

we can see it immediately, oil, Sector and Petrofac almost follow the same trend, and there is a 

slight increase in Oil price in the end of June 2017 which gave Petrofac a significant uptrend. 

4.2 Beta and correlation 

Beta is a measure of systematic risk, which was calculated by using monthly price, and it 

describes the volatility of Petrofac price relative to the market (FTSE250 as the market 

benchmark, FTASX0570 as the Sector index). The data of calculation is used as following 

numbers (and all of them were calculated by excel functions): 

M = Market (FTSE250), PFC = Petrofac, S = Sector

Figure 18 Correlation FTSE250 &amp;amp; Petrofac 

Systematic Risk 

The beta value (M/PFC) taken from Thompson Reuters is different from my calculations 

because the data used is different (Adjusted or unadjusted), despite I covered the same period. 

The self-calculated beta is 0.5763 and the correlation of PFC and the market is 0.1503, which 

means if the market increases by 1% the price of PFC increase by less than 1%. While the R-

squared (0.0226) tells us that there are only 2.26% of the movements of stock can be explained 

by movements of market. The unsystematic risk (1 - 2.26% = 97.74%) cannot be eliminated 

and could be explained by the investigations from the SFO. 

Political and Geographical Risk 

This risk arises principally from Petrofac’s over-sea operations, especially from the Middle East 

and North Africa caused by the changing political landscape. The over-concentration in specific 

market is another problem. As a result, the security risk assessments are used by Group Risk 

Committee to ensure the completion of all projects.

IT Resilience 

A business disruption and a loss of competitive position might happen because of IT risk. In 

2016, the business secret data has been moved to new data centers. Moreover, company 

invested heavily in cyber intrusion detection and prevention tools. Additionally, cyber seminars 

were held to raise awareness for employee. 

Lack of Effective Talent 

It should be highlighted that the products of Oil and Gas Equipment and Services Sector are 

homogeneous, the company wants to be ahead with the help of employee’s knowledge. To 

solve the lack of employee with insufficient skills and experiences, Petrofac developed a 

systematic talent performance management and leadership excellence program. 

Financial Capacity 

Petrofac maintains a healthy capital by using a mixture of external and internal financing. The 

capital of equity has been calculated as 4.66% via CAPM. In order to fund ongoing projects, 

Petrofac needs more finance in the future so that the company is exposed to liquidity risk. The 

board has defined a maximum level of leverage, and improved the debt position over 2016 to 

avoid the losing of financial capacity. As shown on the balance sheet, there is a 10% reduction 

in Net Debt from US $686 million to US $617 million (2015), while they are projecting to 

complete a global cash management program in 2017. 

Interest Rate 

According to Annual Report 2016, the interest rate risk arising from Petrofac’s long-term debt 

rate and its cash and bank balances. The company works against its interest cost by mixing the 

fixed and variable debt rate, the cash and bank balances are using floating rates. 

Foreign currency risk 

Petrofac uses US dollar to calculate almost all of the financial capital, as the operations has 

been spread to 29 countries. This makes the company vulnerable to exposure against the 

exchange rate. The forward exchange contracts are used to hedge this risk. In the end of 2016, 

a series of contracts have been formed during January 2017 to June 2019 

Cost of Equity 



Risk and Return   

45 

 

Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) should be used to value the company through the cost of 

equity, which describes the relationship of the systematic risk and expected return of the stock. 

Expected Return Formula: 

??  =  ?? + ?(?? –  ??) 

Where: 

??  : Expected Return on Asset (Cost of Equity)  

? : Beta, Systematic Risk 

 ??: Risk Free Rate 

?? –  ??  : Risk Premium 

 

According to Burfield, the Gilts are the most common benchmark in UK, and our data collected 

for five-year period. Therefore, the UK Gilt 10 Year Yield has been used as the risk-free rate, 

which was taken from Bloomberg. The value is 1.20% for 3rd July 2017. 

 ??  = 1.20% 

Risk Premium is needed to estimate the cost of equity, which is the difference of expected return 

between risky asset and the risk-free rate (UK Gilts rate). According to Section 4.1 the equity 

market premium was calculated by using the yearly FTSE price (which is 20-year Geometric 

Mean 7.23%) from 1998 to date. 

?? –  ??  = 7.23% -1.20% = 6.03% 

Cost of Equity of Petrofac: 

? = 1.20% + 0.5736 × 6.03% = 4.66%

Because there are no interest expenses in 2012, the data from 2013-2016 will be used to 

calculate the average cost of debt. 

It can be seen from the Table 13 that Petrofac using a combination of debt and equity financing, 

but there is no short-term debt on its Income and Financial Statement. In 2016, Petrofac 

improved their free cash flow position with a 10% reduction in Net Debt to US$617 million 

because of a strong cash generation, but the 56.2% Net Gearing Ratio is still high which 

reflecting a greater risk. However, interest bearing debt brings a major benefit from tax since it

is tax deductible. The above Table shows that there is a dramatic increase in effective tax rate, 

which led to a great tax benefit. A reduction in finance leads interest costs to offset the increase 

in debt interest expenses since the finance cost remained unchanged in 2016. The graphic below 

shows the equity and debt, the debt amount has increased over the past 5 years. The D/E ratio 

has a significant increase from 0.23 to 2.12, which stipulates a high level of debt within the 

company.

The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) helps to measure the cost of capital for a firm. 

Equity is measured by the market capitalization ($1,868.48 Million). The market value of debt 

is difficult to calculate, to be in line the four-year average book value of debt will be used, 

which is $2,273 Million.

According to the Table 15 that relates the interest coverage ratio to a credit rating (see Appendix 

4), because the Market Cap of Petrofac is around $1.86 billion, we will look at small non-

financial service companies), the rating of a company is Aa2 and the default spread should be 

0.80%, as the Interest Coverage is 5.67 which was calculated by using date from the Finance 

Report 2016. However, Moody’s Investors Service has announced on 31st May 2017 that they 

have downgraded the rating of Petrofac to a Ba1 rating, the spread is 2.50%. There is a big 

difference between self-calculate rating and the Moody’s rating, because the rating is not only 

a reflection of statistical factors, the principle of rating includes an appraisal of long-term risks.

The interest coverage in 2016 shows that the earning can give an excellent protection and a 

high liquidity for the company whereas the Moody’s rating is in line with the net gearing ratio 

that there is a serious default issue, which increases the uncertainty of profitability, even there 

is just a slight sudden increase in interest rate or a recession. Furthermore, the financial penalty 

will happen with a long-term influence for financial leverage (Moody, 2017). 

Table 15 Leverage &amp;amp; Liquidity 

The Quick Ratio and Current Ratio of Petrofac are the lowest compared to FTSE250 and the 

Oil and Gas Equipment and Services Industry. The quick ratio of 0.77 means that Petrofac has 

only US$0.77 liquid assets available to cover 1-dollar current liabilities. This is in line with the

low current ratio, which means the company has less capacity to pay off its debt. The higher 

debt level has a negative consequence when interest rates are high, even though there is a great 

tax benefit, as the tax benefit cannot offset the high interest rates.

Table 16 Dividend 

Shareholders have the right to elect their dividend currency (UK Sterling or US Dollars), 

together with the interim and final dividend, which gives the full year dividend maintained at 

65.80 cents per share, in line with the prior year. However, the Pay-out Ratio has a significant 

increase during the 5 years period, the net profit in 2016 of US$1 million is less than the 

dividends paid of US$223.72 million. This reflects the profit trends to decrease, the dividends 

paid are not well covered by Net Income, especially in 2015 with the abnormal Pay-out Ratio 

(-64%). In order to deliver a sustainable and long-term value to shareholders, Petrofac has paid 

the financial returns form the growth of share price. It can be seen from the Table 17 that the 

Retained Earnings cover the dividend payed, which helps to achieve the goal to give the 

shareholders satisfaction. 

The Performance Share Plan has been used to reward the delivery of targets related to long-

term business strategy, the awards can be up to 300% of base salary. The Board forecasted that 

the company has been placed in a stressful situation against several risks that might affect its 

future financial activities, the risks include the decline in oil price, the reduction in future orders, 

the poor performance of E&amp;amp;P Services, the increase in working capital and a significant

financial loss. In considering all of the impacts, the company might decrease the dividends in 

the following years.

Since the beginning of 2014 the oil price continued to lower which led to a negative impact in 

the Oil and Gas Equipment and Services Sector. Simultaneously the return on equity, asset and 

capital went down although the market operated well in the meantime. The performance of 

Amec Foster Wheeler and Hunting is in line with the Sector trend, whilst a rebound came on 

Petrofac in 2016 that ROE and ROIC went back to positive. The John Wood Group has 

followed a downward trend, but it still kept positive Return on Equity, Asset and Capital.

Figure 21 P/E ratio 

In order to display the ratio clearly, the P/E Ratio of PFC in 2016 (which is 3,671.21) is not 

shown in the graph. John Wood Group got an over-million dollar exceeding contract from 

Husky Energy which is one of the largest energy companies in Canada, and in the end of 2017 

the group will complete the acquisition of Amec Foster Wheeler. Therefore, John Wood Group 

reach the 148.03 P/E Ratio in 2016, 1.65 times compared to the Sector.  

It is clear to see that the P/E Ratio of the whole Sector and almost all of the companies have 

bottomed out in 2015. In general, investors should be keen to buy the shares because of the low 

P/E Ratio, but a slump can be found in ROE during 2016.

However, the satisfaction of investors cannot be guaranteed by a huge investment, for an 

existence of big difference between the share price and value.

Figure 22 Performance – PFC; WG; SECTOR 

It can be found from the above P/E Ratio graph that Petrofac, John Wood Group and the Sector 

have a great increase in P/E Ratio over 2015 and 2016, especially for Petrofac. P/E Ratio 

indicates the current valuation of the company, and the high ratio means the investors believe 

that profits of the company are stunning in the long-run, they are willing to bear high risk in 

order to get a better return. All of the other ratios are following a slight downward trend. But it 

should be noticed that every ratio of Petrofac has been elevated in 2016, as the revenues were 

up by 15% to US$7.9 billion, a strong growth happened in the net profit to US$1 million in 

2015. Ayman Asfari (Chief Executive) said, the large order backlog (US$14.3 billion) brings 

the company excellent revenue prospects for 2017. This can explain part of the significant P/E 

Ratio.

This group includes the company with a negative performance. First of all, it can be seen from 

the P/E Ratio that Amec Foster Wheeler and Hunting got worse in the recent 2 years, while the 

market still remains at the same level. There is a slight change in current valuation, the market 

got a higher P/E Ratio. Then the other ratio of Amec, Hunting are in line with the P/E Ratio 

overall trend. 

From both sides (current and history), the P/E Ratio indicates that Petrofac are overpriced. On 

the other hand, the investors are paying more for each unit of profit as a result of the high P/E 

Ratio. But for cyclical companies in the oil or oil services industry the period of extreme high 

P/E Ratio might be a suitable time to enter the market for investors.

Which should be noticed is that every ratio has decreased from 2012 to 2015 (except Financial 

Leverage Ratio), but a reversal occurred in 2016. At first, increasing Total Assets have been 

driven by a strong cash generation and short-term investments, an increase in Inventory and 

Property &amp;amp; Plant &amp;amp; Equipment. And it can be found from the Total Assets, the Non-Current 

assets has remained the same level, around US$2000-3000 million while current assets have 

increased from US$3,218 million in 2012 to US$6,018 million in 2016. However, the Asset 

Turnover Ratio is moving down during 2012-2015, even though the Revenue has been in an 

uptrend, as the growth rate of Revenue is lower than Total Assets. This indicates the efficiency 

of Petrofac to deploy assets for revenue generation declined over the period, and the key driver 

is the low utilization efficiency of Current Assets in production and business operations. 



Ratio Analysis

2012-2015 is a challenging period for the Oil and Gas Equipment and Services industry, the 

large decrease in oil price (from US$98.78/BBL in 2012 to 36.6 in 2015) forced oil companies 

to cut down investments, which brought a decrease in Net Profit Margin to the whole industry. 

Only John Wood Group still keeps profitable performance. In 2016, the oil picked up modestly 

to 53.72, Petrofac’s Net Profit Margin was in line and got back to positive. 

The D/E ratio of company reflect the impact of Financial Leverage Ratio on ROE, the company 

can increase their debt to get a high ROE despite weak operating profits. The Financial 

Leverage of Petrofac in 2016 (7.21) was around twice the Leverage in 2012 (3.81), and the D/E 

ratio stands at 2.12, which is extremely high compared to the industry medium (0.38). We need 

to be cautious about the ROE with a rapid rising debt and weak profits.

Enterprise Value is an advantageous instrument to value companies with different capital 

structures, which is a better indicator compared with P/E Ratio, as EV considers the Liquid 

Asset, outstanding Debt and cash equivalents which can affect the market valuation of a 

company greatly. 

Lynch, P and Rothchild, J mention that it does not make sense to buy a cyclical with low P/E 

ratio after several years of record earnings, which might make you lose half your investment

during a short time (1994). In this situation, EV/EBITDA seems provide an effective valuation 

for oil services companies. The EV have been chosen to compare their performance in this part. 

 

Figure 24 EV/EBITDA Comparison 

It should be noticed that EV/EBITDA have followed a different trend with P/E Ratio, this can 

prove that P/E Ratio did not take into account the Capital Structure (outstanding Debt and Cash). 

The downward trend of EV/EBITDA of Petrofac has been driven by the decrease in Net Debt 

from 10% to US$617 million compared to the US$686 million, and a pickup in EBITDA from 

US$312 million in 2015 to US$704 million in 2016. It is obvious that EV/EBITDA Ratio of 

Petrofac is broadly in line with the Sector, although the ratio is a little lower than the Sector in 

2016, it still can tell that Petrofac could be a good choice for making an investment. 

The whole Market performed better than the Sector because of the continued strong world 

economy, but the oil industry recovery will take longer than projected. The ratio of Wood Group 

kept in a stable level during observation, it seems to be the most competitive one within the 

Sector with a 15.1% gearing ratio and 14.1 interest cover ratio, even the gearing ratio trending 

upward from 6.9% in 2012 to 15.1% in 2016. The debt financing should be encouraged in Wood 

Group, which will be cheaper than issuing equity.

Table 32 Oil Price Projection 

The World Economy is projected to pick-up modestly starting from the second half of 2017, 

because of the long-awaited cyclical recovery in global trade and manufacturing. 

For Advanced Economies, Europe and Japan are expected to gain supported by the cyclical 

recovery in 2016. Since the 2016 U.S. Elections the fiscal policy easing was reflected to 

increase which encouraged the U.S. dollar to be stronger against other currencies and U.S. 

Treasury interest rates to increase. In addition, there is a continued growth in UK because of 

the spending resists the impact of the June 2016 referendum for Brexit. 

A mixed performance across EMDEs, the resource misallocation, the reliance on a loose policy 

and the continued rapid credit expansion make the mid-term projected performance to be 

clouded. An economic rebalancing just completed in China, which let the GDP growth to be 

lower but still in a high level. India is expected to gain speed, but it will be offset by Chinese 

slowing growth to some extent. As a representative of commodity exporters, Brazil is predicted 

to get out of the most serious recessions, which can be traced back to the policy uncertainty 

diminishing and fiscal policy easing. In addition, a fiscal turnaround in Russia is emerging 

because of the recovery in oil price. 

As mentioned before, with the support of the agreement about cutting the crude oil output for 

six months among the members of OPEC, the oil prices could be able to increase, which will 

stimulate investment in this filed with oil demand improving. The oil demand will increase up 



Projection   

62 

 

to 99 million barrels/day by 2021, OPEC projected that in 2016 World Oil Outlook Report, and 

there should be significant investment needed. But in the short-term, a revenue decline is still 

projected to come up, which is driven by the decrease in output. 

 

8.2 Firm Specific 

With the long-awaited oil price beginning to pick up (but still in a low level), the confidence in 

the industry is expected to increase in the coming years. The Middle East and North Africa 

(MENA) region are the major customers for oil and gas related services. Petrofac has been 

positioned in the top of region’s EPC Contractor list, ranked by Arabian Oil and Gas Magazine. 

As a core customer, NOC is continued to invest heavily in Petrofac based on their strong and 

well-established relationship. Only few upstream investments within IES has exposure to low 

oil price, but the revenue in the following year may endanger the dividend from the substantial 

falling-off in backlog from US$20.7bn in 2016 to US$14.3bn in 2017.  

 

Net Profit Margin 

The Net Profit Margin is a ratio of Net Income after Tax divided by Revenue, which is a good 

indicator of the health of the company. In the first half of 2017, Petrofac delivered $135 million 

Net Income, based on the strong Backlog in 2016. For the projection, the average Profitability 

Growth during 2012-2016 will be assumed as 3.446% which can be seen from the Table below 

and is the growth for following years. 

NP Margin 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 

Petrofac 10.13% 10.27% 1.92% -5.10% 0.01%

Dividend Growth 

The significant Dividend Pay-out Ratio 22372% in 2016 presents that the dividends paid are 

not well covered by Net Profits. As the Net Income is only $1Million in 2016, but the Board

thought that the dividend is the most important thing for their shareholders. The board proposed 

a final dividend of 43.8 cents per share by using up Retained Earnings. This give rise to doubts 

whether the dividend can be keep at this level in the following years or not. The dividend growth 

rate will be calculated for every year on average, which can be seen from the Table 35 below.

Revenue &amp;amp; Cost 

In May 2017, an investigation was organized to pursue bribery, corruption and money 

laundering concerns. During the investigating period which will last for one year decreasing 

revenue will be driven by the heightened result uncertainty of the investigation. In addition, 

some of the big projects will finish in 2017, and Petrofac is looking for new orders, which are 

driving the revenue and backlog in 2018. The Group Chief Executive, Ayman Asfari said in 

Full Year 2016 Earnings Presentation, there might be a decline in the revenue in the following 

years, because there are low bidders on some projects (Petrofac, 2017). 

For these reasons, the projected revenue will keep going down to around $5,500 million by 

2020. Because some projects will finish in the end of 2017, and if Petrofac cannot take more 

new projects, there will be a steep fall in revenue in 2018. A considerable cost reduction in 

2016 is predicted to continue in the following years, because the engineering teams at Petrofac 

always concentrate on finding the new way to cut cost and improve the cost effectiveness.

Growth%  -5.85% -15.0% -9.7% -0.1%  

Table 35 Revenue Projection 



Projection   

64 

 

It can be seen from the growth rate in the past 5 years that the trend is quite similar with our 

projection for the next 5 years. Therefore, we assume the average growth rate 5.85% as the 

decline rate for 2017, 15.0% for 2018, 9.7% for 2019 and 0.1% for 2020. 

 

Capital structure 

The Petrofac’s Debt to Capital ratio increased a lot during 2012-2015, then it started to be 

constant around 0.68. Therefore, it can be assumed that no changes will be taken for the Capital 

Structure in the future. The future Debt-to-Capital Ratio is going to be 0.68 for the following 5 

years, which is in line with the ratio in 2015 and 2016. 

According to the Presentation of Ayman Asfari (2017), a global Cash Management Program is 

being completed with ongoing rephrasing of Capex in 2017, which helps to get strong cash 

generation, the amount of Debt will decrease in the following years to the lowest level. In the 

meantime, there will be a rebound in Equity, it means the Debt amount will go down to around 

$700m and the equity will increase to 2012 levels by 2020, which is assumed to be $1,600m. 

Assuming that the straight-line method will be used to calculate the growth rate for Debt and 

Equity in the following years which will be -0.264 and 0.093.

The data shown in the Section 7.1 P/E Ratio &amp;amp; Others presented that the Petrofac’s total Assets

industry, there was an unexpected decline in Net Income not only for Petrofac, but also for 

other companies. The growth rate for 2015 and 2016 is -4.29% and -3.58%, but the recovery is

In this Section, the Discounted Dividend Model (DDM), Discounted Free Cash Flow Model 

(DCF) and Abnormal Earing Model (AE) will be used to calculate whether the company is 

undervalued or overvalued. 

 

9.1 Discounted Dividend Model  

The discounted Dividend Model is a standard approach to value a company’s equity, which 

uses the predicted future dividends and discounts them by the Cost of Equity back to present 

value.

This formula consists of two parts: the present value of future dividends and the present value 

of the terminal value calculated by DDM. The discount rate used is 4.66%, based on the cost 

of equity given by CAPM in Section 4.3. The DDM assume the dividend growth rate of -1.28%, 

which is calculated from the 2012-2016 average in Section 8 (Dividend Growth) based on the 

lack of clear projects in the pipeline. According to the historical data, the Dividend per Share 

and the Shares Outstanding were always at the same level, therefore, $0.658 and 340 million 

will be assumed as the DPS and the Number of Shares. 

The Market Capitalization of $1,868.48 million taken from the London Stock Exchange (LSE) 

is lower than the self-calculated Equity Value of $3,897.68 million, so the Discounted Dividend 

Model presents Petrofac is undervalued. The self-calculate share price with $11.46 is higher 

than the current price. All in all, a BUY signal is given as recommendation. 

 

9.2 Discounted Cash Flow Model 

Under the discounted Cash Flow Model, the future free cash flow projection will be discounted 

back to present value by Cost of Equity (discount rate). And the Free Cash Flow to Equity 

(FCFE) will be used to measure the amount of cash Petrofac is paying for their shareholders 

after paying all expenses, reinvestment and debt. The full projection of Debt and Assets and the 

calculation of Discounted Cash Flow Model can be seen in Appendix 6.

The assumptions for this model is made in the Section 8.2, the projected FCFE will be 

calculated as before. The sustainable growth rate (SGR) is calculated in section 6 (Dividend 

Policy) and assumed as the growth rate in this model, because the -1.28% SGR represents the 

recession in line with the whole industry. As shown below, the Terminal Value is equal to 

$2,434.64 Million. The Self-Calculate Equity Value in this model is equal to $2,450.12 Million

9.3 Abnormal Earnings Model 

The Abnormal Earnings Model shows that investors are willing to pay more than book value if 

the earnings are higher than expectation and vice versa. The full projection of Equity and the

The assumption for AE model is the same as the one for DCF model, including the growth rate 

and cost of equity. The conclusion from AE model is same as the result from DCF model is 

undervalued, as the self-calculated Equity Value ($2,337.28 million) to be higher than the 

Market Capitalization ($1,868.48 million) estimated by LSE. The share price is projected to be 

$6.87 per share. All in all, a BUY recommendation is given by this model.

Recommendation 

Influences from 2 sides for the valuation 

 

Negative Side 

SFO Investigation - Over the past few months, because the SFO started to investigate, the 

chief operating officer has been suspended and the share price has fallen by more than 50%. 

According to US broker Jefferies, the expectation of the fine might be around US$200 million. 

Therefore, suspending the dividend could be a rational way to repay this fine and the time 

needed to rebuild their reputation must be considered. 

 

The SFP Investigation is influencing the current share price of Petrofac. The price was falling 

sharply since the investigation was commenced by SFO. But investors have overacted that and 

sold-off their shares resulting in a further decline. 

 

Positive Side 

Weak Exchange Rate – there is a positive translational effect for UK listed companies because 

of the weak exchange rate, 1.2869$/£ in 15/08/2017 (taken from Bloomberg) which can be 

traced back to Brexit. 

 

Cyclical Recovery - As mentioned before, oil and gas service and equipment industry is a 

cyclical industry, which is same as the oil industry. After the long-time depression, long-

awaited rebound is expected in oil industry. The investments from oil companies to Oil and Gas 

Services and Equipment industry is picking up, especially for Petrofac as the Petrofac (ROE 

0.09%) even has much higher return than Sector (ROE -15.10%). 

 

Strong Cash Generation – with the generating of Free Cash Flow of $500m in 2015 and 

$486m in 2016, the price for Petrofac looks cheap. 18% decline in Capex and 10% reduction 



Recommendation   

72 

 

in Net Debt driven by this strong cash generation. Which indicates that Petrofac is undervalued 

if the cash generation is sustainable. 

 

Board Effectiveness – As analyzed in Section 1.3 Corporate Governance and Shareholders, 

Petrofac’s board performs extremely well from 5 different respects. The strong and effective 

board could help Petrofac to escape the terrible situation. 

 

In the valuation section, DDM, DCF and AE model were used to value whether the company 

is overvalued or undervalued, which based on several assumptions of company’s performance. 

However, the DDM is full of assumptions which regarding too many factors, and most of these 

factors are beyond the control of investors as the limited information. Moreover, the key 

shortcoming of this model is DDM assumes there is a correlation between the dividend paid 

and the Revenue. Nevertheless, it can be seen from this project, Petrofac still tries to maintain 

a stable dividend pay-out to satisfy their shareholders, even if their Net Income cannot cover 

the distributions. Therefore, the Dividend Discount Model is not very useful in practice for 

normal investors. The valuation from this model for Petrofac cannot be very accurate with a 

significant dividend paid-out ratio (22372%).  

 

Compared to DDM, the Discounted Free Cash Flow to Equity Model is more popular and 

suitable. A BUY recommendation is given by this model as the company is undervalued. The 

Abnormal Earning Model proved this recommendation, and the projected share price given by 

DCF and AE are close to each other. This shows that in both models my recommendations hold. 

 

All in all, the results from DCF and AE will be taken into the final recommendation, the target 

price will be considered to be the average of the prices from DDM (£5.63) and AE (£5.37), 

which equals to £5.50.

BUY – given the undervalued conclusion of the share price from the DCF and AE model. All 

bad news should be already included in the price, there is no reason for the performance to be 

poor in the future. The following Table represents the consensus forecast from 23 polled
