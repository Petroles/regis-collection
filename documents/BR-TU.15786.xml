Nanotechnology offers a great potential do design fertilizers with unique properties capable to 
boost the plant productivity. However, the nanoparticles environmental fate and their toxic 
responses still need to be deeply investigated to their safe use. This study aims to investigate 
the effect of copper oxide (nCuO) and magnetite nanoparticles (nFe3O4) on the germination 
and seedling development of Phaseolus vulgaris L. Seeds were treated in nanoparticles 
dispersions in a wide range of concentrations (1, 10, 100 and 1 000 mg L-1) and incubated in a 
germination chamber during 5 days. Different sized nCuO (25, 40 and&amp;lt;80 nm) and 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated nFe3O4 were evaluated. Although both nCuO and nFe3O4 
treatments did not affected the germination rate, seedling weight gain was promoted by 40 nm 
CuO at 100 mg Cu L-1 and inhibited by 1 000 mg Cu L-1 of 25 nm CuO and positive control 
(CuSO4). Among the tested nCuO, the higher chemical reactivity was found for the 25 nm 
CuO, and this may partially explain the observed deleterious effects. Seeds treated in nFe3O4-
PEG at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 increased radicle elongation compared to the negative control (water), 
while Fe2+/Fe3+ (aq) (positive control) and bare nFe3O4 at 1 000 mg Fe L-1

 treatments reduced 
the radicle of the seedlings. The growth promoted by the PEG-coated nanoparticles can be 
justified by the higher water uptake induced by the PEG, and also by its lower chemical 
reactivity compared to the bare nanoparticles. This was reinforced by enzymatic assays since 
nFe3O4-PEG treatment was also the least harmful to the ?-amylase activity. X-ray 
fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) showed that most of the Cu and Fe incorporated by the 
seeds remained in the seed coat, specially in the hilum region, and X-ray tomography 
indicated that Fe3O4-PEG penetrated in this structure. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) 
unraveled that the Cu and Fe chemical environment of the nCuO and nFe3O4-PEG treated 
seeds persisted mostly in its primitive form. These results contribute to the understanding of 
how nCuO, nFe3O4 and nFe3O4-PEG interact with common bean seeds and seedlings and 
highlights its potential use in seed priming.

RESUMO 
 

DURAN, N. M. Efeitos de nanopartículas à base de Cu e Fe na germinação e 
desenvolvimento de plântulas de Phaseolus vulgaris L. observados por espectroscopia de 
raios-X. 2018. 88 p. Dissertação (Mestrado em Ciências) – Centro de Energia Nuclear na

A nanotecnologia oferece um grande potencial para o desenvolvimento de fertilizantes com 
propriedades únicas, capazes de impulsionar a produtividade das plantas. Contudo, o destino 
ambiental e os efeitos tóxicos das nanopartículas ainda necessitam ser profundamente 
investigados para o seu uso seguro. Este estudo visa investigar o efeito das nanopartículas de 
óxido de cobre (nCuO) e magnetita (nFe3O4) na germinação e desenvolvimento das plântulas 
de Phaseolus vulgaris L. As sementes foram tratadas em dispersões de nanopartículas em 
diversas concentrações (1, 10, 100 and 1 000 mg L-1) e incubadas em uma câmara de 
germinação durante 5 dias. Diferentes tamanhos de nCuO (25, 40 e&amp;lt;80 nm) e nFe3O4 
recoberta com polietileno glicol (PEG) e foram avaliados. Embora ambos tratamentos de 
nCuO e nFe3O4 não afetaram a taxa de germinação, o ganho de massa das plântulas foi 
promovido pela nCuO de 40 nm à 100 mg Cu L-1 e inibido pelos tratamentos de nCuO de 25 
nm e controle positivo (CuSO4) à 1 000 mg Cu L-1. Dentre as nCuO testadas, a maior 
reatividade química foi encontrada para a nCuO de 25 nm, e isso pode explicar parcialmente 
os efeitos deletérios desta nanopartícula. Sementes tratadas com nFe3O4-PEG à 1 000 mg Fe 
L-1 aumentaram o alongamento das radículas em comparação ao controle negativo (água), 
enquanto que os tratamentos Fe2+/Fe3+ (aq) (controle positivo) e nFe3O4 sem recobrimento à 1 
000 mg Fe L-1 reduziram as radículas das plântulas. O crescimento promovido pelas 
nanopartículas recobertas com PEG pode ser justificado pela maior absorção de água induzido 
pelo PEG, e também pela sua baixa reatividade química comparada às nanopartículas sem 
recobrimento. Isso foi reforçado por ensaios enzimáticos uma vez que o tratamento de 
nFe3O4-PEG foi também o menos prejudicial à atividade da ?-amilase. A espectroscopia de 
fluorescência de raios-X (XRF) mostrou que a maior parte do Cu e do Fe incorporados pelas 
sementes permaneceu no tegumento, especialmente na região do hilo, e a tomografia de raios-
X indicou que nFe3O4-PEG penetrou nesta estrutura. A espectroscopia de absorção de raios-X 
(XAS) revelou que o ambiente químico do Cu e do Fe das sementes tratadas com nCuO e 
nFe3O4-PEG persistiram majoritariamente em sua forma primitiva. Estes resultados 
contribuem para o entendimento de como nCuO, nFe3O4 e nFe3O4-PEG interagem com 
sementes de feijão e destaca seu potencial uso no tratamento de sementes.

1 INTRODUCTION 

 

To achieve a successful growth and yield, crop plants require 17 essential minerals. 

The elements that are required in higher amounts are known as macronutrients, while those 

required in trace quantities are called micronutrients, although they are evenly important for 

plant growth. Namely, macronutrients are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, 

potassium, calcium, magnesium and sulfur. Micronutrients comprise zinc, copper, iron, 

manganese, boron, molybdenum, chlorine, and nickel.1 

Copper (Cu) is an essential redox-active element required for several biochemical and 

physiological process like photosynthesis, respiration, carbohydrate, lipid and nitrogen 

metabolism, protection against oxidative stress and lignification of plant cell walls. It is a 

cofactor in many enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and cytochrome c oxidase.1; 2 Iron 

(Fe) is a cofactor in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll, and it is essential for the structure and 

function of the photosynthetic apparatus. It is an important constituent of enzymes involved in 

redox reactions like cytochromes and iron-sulfur proteins, and many others proteins 

participants of photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation and respiration.1; 3; 4 

To improve the plant nutritional status fertilizers are commonly supplied through soil 

or foliar application. The former present some limitations since some soil properties can 

interfere in element solubility and take up by plant roots.1 Whilst the latter needs higher leaf 

area index for absorption, several sprays sessions for macronutrients, caution when applying 

high concentrated nutrient solutions to avoid leaf damage and, besides that, fertilizer can be 

washed out by rain.5 

Priming seeds with nutrient-containing solutions is an attractive and easy alternative to 

complement these methods. Seed treatment requires few external inputs and low cost 

technologies. It is a simple and effective method of nutrient application.6 

The seed priming consists in exposing the seeds to a certain solution, or dispersion, for 

a certain period. Meanwhile, the seed is partially hydrated but the radicle emergency does not 

happen. Although the germination process does not occur, this moisture level triggers pre-

germination metabolic activity such as nucleic acid and protein synthesis and repair, that 

generally favor germination rate and seedling development.7 The major seed priming 

techniques include hydropriming (seeds are soaked in water), osmopriming (osmotic solutions 

like polyethylene glycol), halopriming (salt solutions such as CuSO4 and CaCl2) and solid 

matrix priming (using solid carriers).8 



12	
  

In general, the germination process is triphasic: phase I, or imbibition, is when the dry 

seed take up water and the metabolic activities are low, whereas during phase II, there is little 

water uptake but intense metabolic activities. In phase III water content increases again 

concomitantly with radicle emergence and growth.9 Regarding Phaseolus vulgaris seeds, the 

seed coat becomes wrinkled and the embryo starts to swell in the earlier hours of imbibition. 

After 48 and 72 hours, the radicle emerges and secondary roots are formed.10 

In the last ten years, many efforts have been devoted to investigate how agriculture 

can be benefited by nanotechnology. A nanoparticle is typically defined as a material with a 

characteristic dimension from 1 to 100 nm.11 Due to their high surface area and nanoscale size, 

they usually differ from their bulk counterparts presenting new chemical and/or physical 

properties, such as mechanical strength,12 optical absorption or emission energy shifts,13 

chemical reactivity,14 surface charges,15 magnetism,16 higher thermal conductivity17 and 

solubility.18 Some of these features, as surface charges, solubility and chemical reactivity can 

be suitable and desired to develop new fertilizers, including those targeted to seed treatment. 

Studies about seed priming with nanoparticles mostly observed beneficial and detrimental 

effects on seed germination and plant development, which may vary according to the plant 

species, tested material, nanoparticle size, time of exposure and applied concentration. Table 

1 shows that nanotechnology can enhance crops yield if such parameters are well established.  

Seeds soaked in zinc oxide nanoparticles at 10 mg L-1 elongated roots of corn 

seedlings.19 Zinc (50-500 mg L-1) and silver (20 and 50 mg L-1) nanoparticles enhanced okra20 

and pearl millet21 seeds germination, but decreased seedlings growth. Cucumber seeds 

exposed to copper oxide (100, 200, 400 and 600 mg L-1)22 and zinc oxide (10, 100 and 1 000 

mg L-1)19 presented decreased root elongation. Although many reports showed that 

nanoparticles can positively or negatively affect seed germination and seedling development, 

the mechanisms behind these phenomena are still poorly understood. 

Along with the crop yield increase appeal, there are the health and environmental 

issues related to the possible negative effects that nanomaterials can bring.23 Nanoparticles 

released in the aquatic environment can be harmful to their organisms,24 in soil can be toxic 

for earthworms25; 26 and beneficial rhizosphere bacteria27 which indirectly affect plants growth. 

On the plant level, nanoparticles can induce genotoxicity,28; 29 alteration in nutritional status,30 

oxidative stress,29 and may result in decreased plant growth and biomass.

Advances on the interaction between environment and nanoparticles require suitable 

analytical techniques for quali-quantitative assessment. Plant mineral analysis is commonly 

carried out by means of spectroscopy techniques like inductively couple plasma mass 

spectrometry (ICP-MS), inductively couple plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) 

and electrothermal atomic absorption spectroscopy (ET-AAS). Each of them presenting their 

own advantages and limitations, but they all have in common the sample preparation step as a 

mandatory procedure. In this operation the sample matrix are destroyed by the digestion with 

strong acids, which is laborious and time-consuming.    

On the other hand, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) requires minimum or none 

sample preparation. This non-destructive feature property makes it a very suitable technique 

for plant analysis in vivo and even in situ, when acquired with handheld devices. Moreover, 

the multielemental and simultaneous capability, high throughput and low cost features make it 

even more attractive.  

There are several variants of XRF systems. In the context of this dissertation, the use 

of benchtop energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) and energy dispersive 

microprobe X-ray fluorescence (µ-XRF) systems are highlighted. Besides providing quali-

quantitative information, µ-XRF is an important tool for seed studies because of its capability 

of elemental distribution mapping.38; 39 It can be useful to investigate the mineral distribution 

in seeds during its development,40 evaluate the elemental distribution between distinct 

genotypes41 and patterns during germination.42 

Besides XRF techniques, this dissertation also employed synchrotron-based X-ray 

absorption spectroscopy (XAS). XAS is widely used to determine the average local structural 

and chemical environment of an absorbing atom. In this method the X-ray beam scans the 

sample over a range of energies below and above the absorption edge of the element of 

interest and a spectrum is created. The absorption edge refers to a sharp increase in the 

absorption coefficient, which occurs when the core electron absorbs energy equal to or greater 

than its binding energy. The energy region of the spectrum from the absorption edge to about 

50 eV above it is the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), which is used to 

determine the oxidation state, geometry and nature of ligands around the element of 

interest.43; 44

Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is the most consumed food legume in the 

world and is the major source of dietary protein in Latin America and Eastern Africa.45 

Besides that, this seed was chosen as model species because it presents low dormancy, and it 

results in a plant of small size and short cycle, which makes it easy to be employed in 

laboratory studies.  

 

1.1 Hypothesis 
	
  

This study raised the following hypothesis: 

	
  i) Nanoparticles (CuO and Fe3O4) can penetrate within the seeds; 

ii) Nanoparticles can enhance seed germination and seedling growth; 

iii) Nanoparticles can be biotransformed after seed soaking. 

 

1.2 Objectives 

 

The general objective of this Masters dissertation was to assess the effect of copper 

oxide (nCuO) and magnetite nanoparticles (nFe3O4) on the germination and seedling 

development of Phaseolus vulgaris L. Thus, a series of experiments were designed to tests the 

abovementioned hypothesis. Seeds were treated in a wide range of concentrations. Different 

sized nCuO and coated nFe3O4 were evaluated. 

To achieve the objectives, the biometric parameters germination rate and seedling 

weight gain were determined. XRF measured the Cu and Fe uptake and pointed out their 

storage location. X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the Cu and Fe chemical environment 

of the nCuO and nFe3O4 treated seeds, while X-ray tomography showed the 3D distribution of 

Fe in the nFe3O4 treated seeds. Radicle elongation and ?-amylase activity were also recorded 

for the nFe3O4 treated seedlings. 

A comprehensive nanoparticle characterization was accomplished through dynamic 

light scattering (DLS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), EDXRF, scanning electron microscopy 

(SEM) for nCuO and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for nFe3O4.

2 X-RAY SPECTROSCOPY UNCOVERING THE EFFECTS OF CU BASED 

NANOPARTICLE CONCENTRATION AND STRUCTURE ON PHASEOLUS 

VULGARIS GERMINATION AND SEEDLING DEVELOPMENT  

 

Abstract  

Nanoparticles properties such as solubility, tunable surface charges, and singular reactivity 

might be explored to improve the performance of fertilizers. Nevertheless, these unique 

properties may also bring risks to the environment since the fate of nanoparticles is poorly 

understood. This study investigated the impact of a range of CuO nanoparticles sizes and 

concentrations on the germination and seedling development of Phaseolus vulgaris L. 

Nanoparticles did not affect seed germination, but seedling weight gain was promoted by 40 

nm CuO at 100 mg Cu L-1 and inhibited by 1 000 mg Cu L-1 of 25 nm CuO and CuSO4. Most 

of the Cu taken up remained in the seed coat with Cu hotspots in the hilum. X-ray absorption 

spectroscopy unraveled that most of the Cu remained in its pristine form. The higher surface 

reactivity of the 25 nm CuO nanoparticles might be responsible for its deleterious effects. The 

present study therefore highlights the importance of the nanoparticle structure for its 

physiological impacts.  

 

Keywords: Phaseolus vulgaris L. CuO nanoparticle. Germination. X-ray based spectroscopy.

2.1 Introduction  

In the past few years, a wide range of engineered nanoparticles, with unique 

physicochemical properties, has been launched on the market and consequently to the 

environment. Such properties make these materials suitable for applications that  substantially 

differ from those of the usual bulk form. The nanoscale particle size of these materials 

increases the surface to volume ratio, thus an important fraction of the atoms lies on  the 

surface. These surface atoms have different properties that   those in bulk, thus affecting their 

solubility, light scattering and absorbance, conductivity, melting point, and catalytic 

properties.1 Being present also in many daily life goods, nanoparticles  can easily be released 

into the environment and reach the entire  food chain. This possibility, which may result in 

toxicological effects on consumers,2 remains so far uncertain and has been a  matter of intense 

debate in recent years.   

The development of nanotechnologies tailored for agricultural purposes can result in a 

more rational use of pesticides,  biocides, and fertilizers,3; 4 potentially reducing the usage of 

these hazardous products in agricultural practices. Such innovations could lead to cost 

reduction, less nutrient leaching, and preservation of the desirable soil microbiota. In this 

 context, we highlight the possibility of employing nanotechnology for seed coating.5 Seed 

coating is an attractive  way for micronutrient delivery. It has the potential to improve 

 seedling growth and crop productivity6 while treated seeds  generally germinate faster and 

more synchronized than nontreated seeds.7 Compared to soil fertilization, seed treatment is an 

easier and cost-effective way requiring a lower quantity of nutrients.6 A significant yield 

increase was observed when wheat seeds were treated with a low dose of Cu-EDTA  
(0.04 kg ha-1).8  

The uptake of nanoparticles by plants occurs not only through the root system9 but 

also via leaves10 and seeds.11 Studies regarding the effects of the interaction between 
nanoparticles and plants are not consensual. While some studies show that nano ZnO 

promoted root elongation in peanut12 and soybean,13 others showed similar results of nano 
CeO2 treatments on coriander,

14 corn, and cucumber,15 while studies on tobacco16 and basil17 

showed detrimental effects on germination and growth upon exposure to nano TiO2.  

The effects of nanoparticle exposure do not only vary with the plant species, they also 

depend on the chemical composition, reactivity, size, and morphology of the particles as well 

as on aggregation state, applied concentration, and experimental conditions. Inside living cells, 



23	
  
	
  

	
  

they can influence crucial processes like oxidative balance, genomic, proteomic, and 

metabolomic. The nanoparticles can be  internalized by endocytosis, and depending on their 

nature,  can be located in different types of organelles. The entrance is controlled by 

biological and physicochemical attributes such as  the cell type, surface chemistry and charge, 

size, shape, and  mechanical properties of the nanoparticles.18  

Specifically regarding the interaction between nanoparticles and seeds, the literature is 

still scarce. Depending on nanoparticle size, composition, and  concentration, germination and 

root elongation can be either favored or reduced. Studies on Cu-based nanoparticles are even 

 scarcer.   

Nanometric copper is broadly used in catalysts, coatings,  electronic components, 

medicines, and lubricant compounds.19 It means that regardless of their potential application 

for seed  treatment, copper-based nanoparticles will ultimately reach the  environment and 

end up interacting with plants. Therefore, we  must investigate and understand how these 

nanoparticles affect  seed germination and seedling development. Albeit found only  as a trace 

element in many plant tissues, copper is considered  essential for vegetal life, being a 

transition metal involved in  several metabolic processes like photosynthesis, mitochondrial 

respiration, oxidative stress protection, and protein synthesis.20 Nonetheless, most reports in 

the literature show an increased  toxicity in plants exposed to copper nanoparticles. 

These reports emphasize an inhibitory effect on seedling growth in  different species such as 

black mustard,21 green peas,22 mung  beans, and wheat.11  

The present study aimed at investigating the effect of commercial Cu-based 

nanoparticles, used for seed priming, on  the germination and seedling development of 

Phaseolus vulgaris, also known as common bean or kidney bean. In order to verify their 

potential use as seed fertilizer and the possible high doses  impairments, we evaluated the 

impact of three nanoparticle sizes (25, 40, and&amp;lt;80 nm) at four concentrations (1, 10, 100 and 

1000 mg Cu L-1). Besides monitoring biometric parameters such as germination rate and 

seedling weight gain,  a comprehensive characterization was carried out using X-

ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) seeking to trace the Cu 

uptake, storage location, and  biotransformation.

2.2 Materials and Methods 

2.2.1 Characterization of pristine CuO nanoparticles and dispersions 

Copper oxide and passivated CuO nanoparticles (herein all  referred as nCuO) were 

purchased from US Nanomaterials Research  Inc. (USA), in three different sizes: 25, 40, and 

&lt;80 nm. Copper sulfate (CuSO4·5H2O) was purchased from MERCK KGaA (Germany) 

and used as a copper ionic reference treatment.  

The purity of each nCuO was determined by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence 

spectroscopy (EDXRF; EDX-720 Shimadzu, Japan). Two hundred milligrams of pristine 

powders were weighted in a 6.3 mm aperture X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) sample 

cup (no. 3577 - Spex Ind. Inc., USA) sealed with a 5 µm thick polypropylene film (no. 3520 - 

Spex Ind. Inc., USA). The samples were analyzed under vacuum, in triplicate, using a 

rhodium (Rh) X-ray tube at 50 kV and auto-tunable current adjusted for a detector deadtime 

below 30% and a 3-mm collimator. The X-ray spectrum of the sample was acquired utilizing 

a Si (Li) detector for 300 s. The quantification was carried out using the fundamental 

parameters method.  

The crystal structure of the nCuO was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) 

employing a PW 1877 diffractometer (Philips,  The Netherlands) with Cu?K? radiation. 

Using the peak width it was possible to estimate the crystallite size by the Scherrer equation:  

D(hkl) = K? / ?cos? 

where D is the mean crystal size of the nanoparticles, K the Scherrer constant (0.94 for 

spherical crystals with cubic symmetry ), ? the wavelength of light used for the diffraction 

(0.154184 nm to Cu), ? the full width at half maximum of the peak, and ? refers to the angle 

measured. 

Nanoparticle morphology was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; 

Inspect F50, FEI Company, ?USA) at the Brazilian Nanotechnology National Laboratory 

(LNNano, Campinas, Brazil). The CuO nanoparticles were suspended in deionized water and 

dispersed using an ultrasonic processor (model 705 Sonic Dismembrator, Fisher Scientific, 

USA) under 50% amplitude for 8 min at 1, 10, 100, and 1 000 mg Cu L-1. The hydrodynamic 

size and the zeta potential were analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS; Zetasizer Nano, 

Malvern Instruments, U.K.) at the Brazilian Biosciences National Laboratory (LNBio, 

Campinas, Brazil).

2.2.2 Germination assay  

Phaseolus vulgaris seeds, variety BRS Cometa, were supplied by the Brazilian 

Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA), having an average germination rate of 88%.  

Seeds were first immersed in a 10% NaClO solution under stirring for 10 s for 

disinfection, followed by rinsing with deionized water. Subsequently, 20 seeds were soaked 

for 20 min in the appropriate concentration of each nCuO size. CuSO4·5H2O solutions at the 

same concentrations were used as a positive control, whereas deionized water was used as a 

negative control. After the exposure, the seeds were placed on a 15 cm paper filter fit on the 

bottom of a Petri dish, and 8 mL of the soaking solution was added for moisturizing the paper 

filter. The Petri dishes were sealed with Parafilm M (Bemis Company Inc., USA), inserted 

into a plastic bag for preventing water loss, and finally incubated in a germination chamber 

(TE-4020, Tecnal, BR) under dark and ventilation at 27 °C for 5 days. The experiment was 

conducted in quadruplicate per treatment. 

The number of germinated seeds was counted daily to determine the rate of 

germination. After 5 days, the assay was completed. Fresh mass was measured and the 

germinated seeds were rinsed in deionized water to remove the surface-bound metal or nano 

metal oxide and then dried in a laboratory oven (515/4A, FANEM, Brazil) at 60 °C for 2 days 

to obtain the dry mass.  

 

2.2.3 Copper uptake quantification  

Dried seedlings were carefully separated in two fractions: seedling and seed coat. One 

gram of each component was weighted in a previously decontaminated porcelain crucible and 

then digested by dry ashing method using a muffle furnace (F-2, Fornitec, Brazil) at 100 °C h-

1 ramp rate up to 550 °C and ashed for 14 h. Each dry ashing digestion batch included a blank 

for ensuring no contamination. The ashes were dissolved in 5 mL of 1 M HNO3(aq), and 950 

µL of this solution was transferred into a 1.5 mL vial and 50 µL of 1 000 mg Ga L-1 was 

added as an internal standard. Then, the sample was homogenized using a tube shaker vortex 

(MA162, Marconi, Brazil). 

The Cu content of the digested samples was determined by EDXRF. Fifteen milliliters 

of the digests were pipetted into the external side window of the 6.3 mm aperture XRF sample 

cup (no. 3577 - Spex Ind. Inc., USA) sealed with 5 µm thickness polypropylene film  

(no. 3520 - Spex Ind. Inc., USA) and dried at 60°C in a laboratory oven. This procedure was 



26	
  

carried out twice. The samples were analyzed in triplicate using a rhodium (Rh) X-ray tube at 

50 kV and auto-tunable current with a deadtime at 30% and a 3-mm collimator. The X-ray 

spectrum of the sample was acquired utilizing a Si (Li) detector for 200 s. The quantification 

was performed using external standard calibration. The recovery of this method was assessed 

spiking the sample with 1 000 mg Cu L-1 before the dry ashing step.  

 

2.2.4 nCuO solubility 

To verify the Cu solubility of each nCuO powder, 50 mL of nCuO aqueous 

dispersions were prepared at 100 and 1 000 mg Cu L-1 using a probe ultrasonic device  

(Fisher Scientific™ Model 705 Sonic Dismembrator). The equipment was operated at 95 W 

(amplitude of 50 %) and 50 J, during 4 x 5 min with an interval of 3 min between each cycle. 

After 24 hours, one milliliter of each dispersion was transferred to Eppendorf™ vials  

and then centrifuged by a microcentrifuge (Mikro 120, Hettich, Germany) for 60 minutes at 

13 000 rpm.  

Quantitative analysis of the supernatants was performed by EDXRF using Ga as 

internal standard. The analysis parameters and experimental setup were the same as above 

mentioned (copper uptake quantification).   

 

2.2.5 Mapping the Cu accumulation spots  

The seeds were exposed to 25 and 80 nm nCuO dispersions at 1 000 mg Cu L-1 and  

40 nm nCuO at 5 000 mg Cu L-1 for 20 min, dried at room temperature, and gently cut in the 

middle using a stainless steel blade. Subsequently, the seed was placed in a sample holder 

with a poly(amide) tape and the cotyledon’s inner side exposed for analysis. Chemical images 

of the primary root were also recorded at the third, fourth, and fifth day germination. For the 

latter measurements, the same germination assay procedure was followed, but only the higher 

nCuO concentration (1 000 mg Cu L-1) treatment and copper sulfate (positive control) were 

analyzed, except for the 40 nm nCuO treatment which seeds were soaked in 100 mg Cu L-1.  

The microanalysis was carried out using benchtop microprobe X-ray fluorescence 

system (Orbis PC EDAX, USA) operating with a Rh X-ray tube at 40 kV and 300 µA.  

The sample was interrogated with a 30 µm X-ray beam spot size provided by a polycapillary 

optic. The detection was carried out by a 30 mm2 silicon drift detector (140 eV FWHM at the 

5.9 keV Mn-K? line) with a deadtime of nearly 3%. Seed maps were registered using a matrix 



27	
  
	
  

	
  

of 64x50 points (number of analyzed points on xy-axes) and dwell time per pixel of 1 s. For 

the primary roots, a matrix of 32x25 points and 500 µs of dwell time were selected. 

 

2.2.6 Copper chemical speciation analysis  

Sample preparation for determining copper speciation by micro-X-ray absorption 

near-edge structure (µ-XANES) analysis was the same as used for µ-XRF analysis, but the 

seeds only received the 1 000 mg Cu L-1 dispersion treatment. After drying, the samples were 

stored in sealed Petri dishes 10 days prior analysis. The analysis was accomplished using µ-

XANES at the D09B-XRF beamline at the 1.37 GeV Brazilian Synchrotron  Light Laboratory 

(LNLS, Campinas, Brazil).  

At XRF beamline, synchrotron radiation was generated by a  bending-magnet and 

collimated by slits. The monochromatic beam was produced by a Si(111) crystal and a KB 

mirror system was used to focus it to the 20 µm diameter spot size. The µ-XANES spectra 

were recorded in fluorescence mode using a silicon drift detector (SDD; AXAS-A,  KETEK 

GmbH, Germany). The energy was calibrated utilizing a  reference Cu foil.   

The chemical maps, previously provided by µ-XRF analysis, aided selecting the 

proper seed region for µ-XANES analysis according to the Cu accumulation spots after the 

nCuO exposure. The µ-XRF maps identified three different regions for speciation studies: 

outside seed coat, within seed coat, and cotyledon near seed coat.  

In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, five XANES spectra were recorded and 

merged in each sample region. Sixteen reference Cu compounds were previously synthesized 

in our laboratory according to Sarret et al.23 and measured for providing the model spectra. 

The µ-XANES spectra were normalized and subjected to linear combination fitting (LCF) 

analysis using the Athena software of the IFEFFIT package.24 The uncertainties stated for the 

weighted  compounds correspond to 1? standard errors.   

 

2.2.7 Root microscopic analysis 

To determine the exact tissue of Cu accumulation in root samples, seedlings were 

cleared in a solution of 2.5% commercial bleach in deionized water for 24 h and rinsed 

in deionized water five times. Roots were cut from the rest of the seedling  and mounted on 

glass slides with 50% glycerol. Images were taken on a Zeiss AxioVert 35 microscope 

coupled with a Zeiss AxioCam ICc 3  digital camera in brightfield conditions.

2.2.8 Surface reactivity of CuO nanoparticles 

The reactivity of the  CuO nanoparticles was evaluated measuring its ability to 

decompose  H2O2 through a Fenton-like reaction.
25 In a 25 mL round-bottom reaction flask, 

19.5 mL of a 1 000 mg Cu L-1 aqueous dispersion of the tested nanoparticle was magnetically 

stirred. The flask was connected to a 25 mL graduated pipet through a silicone tube. The pipet 

was immersed in a measuring cylinder water column. Then, 0.5 mL of 30% v/v H2O2 solution 

was inserted in the reaction flask with a syringe. The volume of the produced O2 was 

monitored by following the shift of a water column in a pipet. The procedure was carried out 

twice. In addition to the CuO nanoparticles, also the O2 evolution by CuSO4 was determined. 

 

2.2.9 Statistical analysis  

The number of germinated seeds and the weight data were submitted to analysis of 

variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s multiple range tests at 95% confidence interval using the 

Action Stat software (version 3.3.111.1178, Estatcamp, BR). 

 

2.3 Results and Discussion  

2.3.1 Characterization of the nanoparticles and dispersions  

The purity of the nanoparticles as evaluated by EDXRF was above 99.6% for all 

nanoparticles (Table 2.1). The contaminants found were Cr, Ca, and Sn and their 

concentrations ranged from hundreds to thousands mg kg-1. XRD patterns, presented in Figure 

2.1, showed that crystalline phases present in the 40 and 80 nm particles corresponded to CuO 

in the monoclinic phase. For the 25 nm particles, besides the standard diffraction peaks 

attributed to CuO the XRD pattern also revealed the presence of face centered cubic metallic 

Cu as informed by the supplier. The crystallite size in the direction of the plane 111 of the 

oxidic phase was 3.91, 23, and 21 nm for the 25, 40, and 80 nm CuO nanoparticles, 

respectively. The crystallite size in the 111 direction for the metallic fraction of the 25 nm 

particles was 5.21 nm (see Table 2.2). The particle sizes measured by SEM were in agreement 

with those reported by the supplier (Figure 2.2).

The stability of the nCuO aqueous dispersions used for seed treatments was evaluated 

by DLS and zeta-potential (Table 2.3). These nanoparticles were dispersed without any 

surfactants, and primary particle agglomeration was observed with average hydrodynamic 

diameters of 428, 180, and 273 nm for 25, 40, and 80 nm nCuO, respectively. Measurements 

showed that these particles presented negative zeta-potentials regardless the size, with values 

of ?21 ± 5, ?15 ± 6, and ?25 ± 7 mV for 25, 40, and 80 nm nCuO, respectively. The literature 

reported similar  values for 20?200 nm nCuO water dispersions, for which a hydrodynamic 

diameter of 480 nm and a zeta potential of ?21  ± 2 mV were found.26

X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements for the pristine 25 nm nCuO 

showed that this nanoparticle contained  metallic Cu, Cu2O, and CuO, as shown in Figure 2.3. 

The linear  combination analysis of the XANES spectra revealed the  following proportion: 

CuO (65 ± 2%), Cu2O (18 ± 4%), and  Cu (17 ± 10%). The XRD input and XAS analysis

allowed us  to conclude that the structure of the 25 nm nCuO consisted of  a metallic core 

made of Cu covered by oxidized layers of Cu2O  and CuO. Therefore, the results obtained for 

the 25 nm nCuO  may not only be a consequence of their size but may also be  influenced by 

the chemical composition of its core. One should keep in mind that the core properties can 

affect the surface of  the material.   

 

Figure 2.3 - Linear combination fit for Cu-K edge XAS spectra recorded for the 25 nm CuO based 
nanomaterial. The 25 nm CuO nanoparticle was a mixture of CuO (65 ± 2 %), Cu2O (18 ± 4%) and Cu 
(17 ± 10%) R-factor= 0.31%.  

 

 

2.3.2 Effects of nCuO on seed germination and seedling growth 

Figure 2.4 shows the root development on the fifth day  after the seeds were exposed 

to the Cu treatments. Qualitative measurements of growth parameters pointed out that 1 and 

10 mg Cu L-1 nCuO promoted root elongation in comparison to  the water control. Root 

elongation inhibition was noticed from 100 mg Cu L-1 nCuO upward. The only exception was 

the 100 mg Cu L-1 treatment with 40 nm nCuO that did not affect root  elongation.

Figure 2.4 - Morphological characteristics of germinated P. vulgaris seeds soaked in (a) 25 nm, (b) 40 
nm, (c)&amp;lt;80 nm CuO nanoparticles, and (d) CuSO4. Concentrations of the treatments varied from 1 to 
1 000 mg Cu L-1 

 

 

Figure 2.5 presents both (a) germination rate and (b) fresh  mass gain on 5th day after 

germination. For the water control, the  average germination rate was 80%. All the nCuO 

treated seeds  had higher or comparable values compared to the negative  control, except for 

the 40 nm nCuO treatment at 1 mg Cu L-1 that had only 70% germination. The highest and the 

lowest germination rates were found for the CuSO4 treatments at 100 (92.5%) and 1 000 mg 

Cu L-1 (65%), respectively.  

Figure 2.5b displays the fresh weight gain in a 2D plot as a function of the 

concentration of Cu in the dispersion and particle size. For the negative control (water), we 

considered  zero entry values for particle size and concentration. For the  positive control 

(CuSO4), we considered a size of 0.8 nm based  on the diameter of CuSO4 molecule
27 and the 

several  concentrations employed in the test.  

The 2D plot interpolates sizes and concentrations revealing the trends between 

the actual tested points. Figure 2.5b shows that on the fifth day of the  germination assay, 

some treatments tended to promote fresh  mass gain (reddish areas) whereas others tended to 

prevent it  (bluish areas). Seeds exposed to 80 and 40 nm nCuO at 1 and 100 mg Cu L-1, 

respectively, had the highest mass gain. The 25 nm CuO nanoparticles were deleterious at 100 

and 1 000 mg  Cu L-1, while the&amp;lt;80 nm nCuO and CuSO4 reduced seedling  development at 



33	
  
	
  

	
  

1 000 mg Cu L-1. The difference between the  higher and lower mass gain was statistically 

significant according to the Tukey test (p &amp;lt;0.05). Figure 2.6 shows that  low concentrations 

and higher particle size improved mass gain whereas higher concentrations regardless of the 

particle size,  including CuSO4, reduced the mass gain. A similar trend was  found for the dry 

mass (data not shown here).

The mass gain test suggested a hormetic behavior for 40 nm CuO particles reaching 

the maximum beneficial effect at 100  mg Cu L-1. According to the Dunnett’s test, mass  

gain was  significantly different from the control at 100 mg Cu L-1 of 40 nm nCuO and for 

CuSO4 at 1 000 mg Cu L
-1 (Figure 2.7). Among the nanoparticles, mass gain showed a  

dose-related decrease for 25 nm CuO, with the inhibition being similar to that of CuSO4  
at 1 000 mg Cu L-1.  

 

Figure 2.7 - Weight gain of P. vulgaris seeds as function of the concentration of nCuO and CuSO4 (in 
mg Cu L-1). According to the Dunnett’s test at p&lt;0.05 the treatments marked with asterisk are 
significantly different from the negative control 

 

 

Copper is a micronutrient, but as any chemical it becomes toxic at high concentrations. 

High Cu concentrations reduce root development, leading to deficient water and nutrient 

uptake and consequent growth reduction.28 This was confirmed by the results shown in Figure 

2.4, where seedling growth is strongly affected by an excess of Cu.  

Increments in germination rate were also observed for other seed species treated with 

nano Zn29 and Ag.30 Gokak and Taranath suggested that Zn nanoparticles may photo generate 

radical species that can favor the germination process, Parveen and Rao argued that Ag 

nanoparticles might create nano holes facilitating the water transport. Although these 

hypotheses might sound interesting, the experimental strategies in the cited papers did not 

prove them. The argument of the radical formation, regardless the generation mechanism,

found some resonance in our results. As discussed below, the copper nanoparticles were 

reactive (in terms of H2O2 decomposition), it is currently known that radicals may also act as 

singling molecule and therefore, under certain conditions, they could promote the 

germination.31  

Contrary to our findings, low doses of&amp;lt;50 nm CuO nanoparticles decreased the 

germination of rice (Oryza sativa L.); the concentrations used were 0.5?1.5 mM (39.8 to 

119.3 mg L-1). Root mass and length were equally affected under nCuO stress. Copper 

stressed roots showed loss of viable cells as established by Evans blue staining.32 In green 

peas (Pisum sativum L.), mass gain was also impaired at higher nCuO  concentrations (from 

100 to 500 mg L-1). An increase in  reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and gene 

expression  in the roots were found.22 Lower concentrations (10 and 20 mg  L-1) of 20?30 nm 

nCuO reduced the root length and mass  gain of lettuce (Lactuca sativa), accompanied by 

increased  catalase activity and decreased ascorbate peroxidase activity.33   

Thus, in addition to our results that showed that dose and  type of nanoparticles play a 

role in the seed germination and  growth effects, the literature indicated that the effects may 

also  vary from one plant species to another.   

 

2.3.3 Determination of Cu uptake by Phaseolus vulgaris  seeds  

To determine the Cu content of seedlings exposed to nCuO, CuSO4, and water by 

EDXRF, the seed coat was removed to enable separate analysis of the seedling and respective 

seed coat (Figure 2.8).  

Figure 2.8 - Seed coat and seedling of a common bean. These parts were separated to determine the 
Cu content shown in Figure 2.9  

 



36	
  

Figure 2.9 presents the concentration of Cu accumulated in the seedlings (a) and in the 

seed coat (b). The concentration of Cu in both the seedling and the seed coat increased as a 

function of the nCuO or CuSO4 concentration. Copper was much more concentrated in the 

external than in the inner part of the seeds. It means that the seed coat was an effective barrier 

for nCuO absorption, but this was less evident for CuSO4. In the case of  ZnO nanoparticles, 

Zn uptake by the endosperm of corn without seed coat during germination was about six 

times higher than in the whole grain.34  

Deionized water treatment (negative control) gave concentrations of 14.8 ± 0.5 mg Cu 

kg-1 in the seedling and 8.2 ± 1.6 mg Cu kg-1 in the seed coat. Concentrations close to the 

negative control were observed for the seeds exposed to nCuO at 1 and 10 mg Cu L-1, 

suggesting that at these concentrations Cu hardly managed to enter and cross the seed coat. 

The concentration of Cu incorporated by the seeds sharply rose at nCuO exposure levels of 

100 and 1 000 mg Cu L-1. Compared to the other two nanoparticles sizes, the 40 nm nCuO 

seemed to be less incorporated by the seeds.  

A linear correlation was found between the content of Cu taken up by the seed 

coat/seedling and the concentration of CuSO4 solution used for seed priming. Both adjusts 

(not shown here) gave Pearson’s r &gt; 0.98. The slope for the relationship between Cu 

concentration in the embryo and exposure concentration (Figure 2.9a) was 11.2 times lower 

than that found for the seed coat (Figure 2.9b).  

 

Figure 2.9 - Copper concentrations in the (a) seedling and (b) seed coat of germinated common bean 
seeds treated with 25, 40,&amp;lt;80 nm CuO nanoparticles, CuSO4 (1?1 000 mg Cu L

-1) and H2O (control)

Cu solubility tests were carried out to evaluate the fraction of soluble Cu ions released 

by the nCuO. They indicated that the smaller the nCuO size, the greater the solubility  

(Figure 2.10). At 100 mg Cu L-1, the supernatant fraction of the 25 nm nCuO dispersion 

contained 1.1 ± 0.3 mg Cu L-1 compared with 0.18 ± 0.01 mg Cu L-1 for the 80 nm nCuO 

dispersion. Such low concentrations in solution suggest that Cu incorporated by the seedling 

corresponded mainly to dispersed nCuO rather than only to ionic Cu in solution. For 

cucumber seedlings (Cucumis sativus L.), which seeds were exposed to ZnO nanoparticles, 

the Zn content was significantly correlated with the soluble Zn found in the solution, which 

indicates that cucumber seeds uptake Zn mainly in the soluble form.34  

Exposure to the 80 nm nCuO led to concentrations of 40 ± 9 and 1 500 ± 400 mg Cu 

kg-1 in the embryo and seed coat, respectively. Different from the 25 nm nCuO, no effect on 

germination or weight was found for 80 nm nCuO at 1 000 mg Cu L-1. These results suggest 

that these latter nanoparticles may be used in seed priming when it is aimed at overcoming Cu 

deficiency.

2.3.4 Spatial distribution of Cu in the soaked seeds  

µ-XRF is a nondestructive microanalytical method that allows evaluating the spatial 

distribution of elements in for instance biological tissues. To the best of our knowledge, this is 

the first µ-XRF mapping of treated seeds. This technique has been commonly used to 

investigate the allocation of elements in nontreated seeds like wheat,35 rice,36 soybean,37 and 

Arabidopsis thaliana.38 However, most of these studies employed synchrotron X-ray sources. 

Here we show results acquired using an X-ray tube excitation laboratory benchtop facility that 

uncovered the pattern of distribution of Cu in the nCuO and CuSO4 exposed bean seeds.  

Figure 2.11 shows the mapped area of the seed and the corresponding Cu chemical 

image for a seed soaked in CuSO4 (a) nCuO 25 nm (b) and nCuO 40 nm (c). The images were 

recorded 24 h after the soaking and prior to seed germination. The µ-XRF maps confirmed the 

EDXRF results (shown above) that the Cu was mostly concentrated in the seed coat but also 

revealed the presence of Cu hotspots in the hilum region.   

To be absorbed by the seeds, the water-dispersed nanoparticle must cross the seed coat 

(or testa). This structure is composed by a layer of sclerenchyma cells, similar to the palisade 

cells, with a thick cell wall. Below this layer, there is another layer characterized by smaller 

cells and finally a parenchyma composed of elongated outer cells and smaller internal cells 

with irregular or branched shapes. Common beans have a hilum associated with the seed coat, 

which is a scar left by the funiculus, the structure that connects the seed to the placenta. Just 

below the hilum there is the micropyle, a small pore that allows water uptake into the seed.39 

 

  



39	
  
	
  

	
  

Figure 2.11 - Pictures and µ-XRF chemical maps for Cu in common bean seeds exposed to (a) CuSO4 
at 1 000 mg Cu L-1, (b) nCuO 25 nm at 1000 mg Cu L-1, and (c) nCuO 40 nm at 5 000 mg Cu L-1 

 

 

 

The chemical images also revealed the existence of a concentration gradient from the 

outer to the inner region of the seed. This indicates that movement of Cu is driven by the 

higher chemical potential of the nCuO dispersion or CuSO4 solution. Since the seed coat is 

not a homogeneous structure, the nCuO particles or Cu ions may find preferential channels, 

such as through the micropyle.  

Differently from the EDXRF assessment, which gave the average concentrations of 

Cu in the seedling (comprising the storage tissue and emerging root) (Figure 2.9a), the spatial 

resolution provided by the 30 µm X-ray beam shows that Cu is concentrated in a small 

fraction of the embryo. Therefore, although Cu is not well distributed along the seedling 

tissue, its presence in very specific regions of the tissue was sufficient to affect seedling 

weight gain at 1 000 mg Cu L-1. 

  



40	
  

Because of its high solubility, Cu from the CuSO4 treatment was more prone to be 

absorbed than from the nCuO treatment. This indicates that Cu transport through the seed 

occurs by diffusion, since the transport of Cu ions is much faster and easier than that of 

nanoparticles. 

 

2.3.5 Chemical speciation of the incorporated Cu  

Once Cu accumulation spots were located, we determined its chemical form using 

XAS, which is a nondestructive tool. Figure 2.12a shows the spots measured in the treated 

seeds. Figure 2.12b?d  shows the spectra recorded in the outside, seed coat, embryo,  radicle, 

and pristine nanoparticles used to produce the 1 000 mg Cu L-1 dispersions. Figure 2.12b 

presents data for treatments with 25 nm nCuO, Figure 2.12c for 40 nm nCuO and Figure 

2.12d for 80 nm nCuO.   

Figure 2.12b indicates that the chemical environment on the  outside of the seed coat, 

in the hilum region (seed coat) and  inside the seed (embryo) treated with 25 nm nCuO was 

the  same. The spectra recorded in these regions are slightly different from the spectra 

obtained for the pristine 25 nm nCuO. The observed differences are the decrease of the pre-

edge feature at 8 982 eV assigned to the 1s to 4p electronic transition in Cu1+ followed by an 

increase of the white line  intensity. These two spectral changes are related to the  oxidation of 

Cu1+ to Cu2+.40 The spectrum recorded in the radicle presented the features of the pristine 

material.  

Figure 2.12c shows a pronounced shoulder feature for the Cu located in the embryo of 

the seed primed with nCuO. This feature is associated with Cu1+ and indicates that 40 nm 

nCuO was reduced compared to that found in the seed coat and outside of the seed. The linear 

combination analysis (Figure  2.13) showed that spectra recorded in the embryo could be 

 described as a mixture of 34 ± 1% Cu2O and 66 ± 1% CuO. Figure 2.12d shows that the 

chemical neighborhood of Cu incorporated by the seed tissues and radical in the samples 

treated with 80 nm nCuO did not change and remained as CuO. The spectra recorded in the 

samples perfectly overlapped that recorded for the pristine 80 nm nCuO powder.

42	
  

The copper chemical environment in harvested Arabidopsis  thaliana seeds treated 

with 20 and 50 mg L-1 nCuO was also  mostly in the form of CuO (88.8%), with some 

Cu2(OH)PO4 (2.0%), Cu-acetate (3.2%), and Cu2O (6.0%).
41 This suggests that nCuO can be 

also accumulated in plant progeny.   

Although our results showed a slight redox behavior for 40  and 25 nm nCuO in a 

physiological environment, the Cu-based  nanoparticles used in this study were not as reactive 

as ZnO.37 This can be partially explained by the low solubility of the CuO  based 

nanoparticles. However, one has to keep in mind that the  sensitivity of XAS would hardly be 

able to identify the presence  of Cu factions below 5 wt %.   

The combined data supplied by EDXRF, µ-XRF maps, µ-XANES, and literature 

background on seed morphology39 suggested that the main Cu uptake mechanism takes place 

through diffusion driven by the concentration gradient. The main entrance region was the 

hilum spongy tissue. The  presence of CuO and Cu2O most likely indicated that the CuO 

nanoparticles were incorporated as entire particles instead of  anions. In addition to the 

spectroscopic speciation, this  hypothesis was supported by the hilum pore size, 

which reaches tens of micrometers (see the electronic Supporting Information of Duran et 

al.42). The presence of Cu  in the endosperm region away from the hilum (Figure 2.11c) also 

implied that possibility of Cu to cross the seed coat structure. Nevertheless, the extent of the 

penetration into the endosperm was smaller. In this context, it is worth mentioning that 

there are many pathways of Cu transportation in plants. In cell-to-cell  migration, Cu can be 

coordinated by proteins like Cu  chaperones and Cu carriers, which transport Cu to the 

organelles.43   

 

2.3.6 In vivo spatial distribution of Cu in the seedlings  

In  addition to the chemical maps that uncovered the spatial distribution of Cu in the 

seeds after the priming, we mapped the in vivo chemical distribution of Cu in the primary root 

of the seedling under development. We monitored seedlings primed in CuSO4 at 1 000 mg Cu 

L-1 and 40 nm nCuO at 100 mg Cu L-1 since these treatments showed significant effects 

compared to the control according to the Dunnett’s test.

Figure 2.14a-c shows the pictures and corresponding Cu?K? chemical images for the 

emerging primary root of the seedling primed in CuSO4 at 1 000 mg Cu L
-1 on the third, 

fourth, and fifth day of germination, respectively. The chemical images revealed a hotspot of 

Cu on the tip of the primary root, which remained on the same location along the monitored 

period and was not diluted during the growing process.

Figure 2.16 presents an optical microscope image that was allowed to precisely 

identify the tissue in which the Cu spots were found. It corresponded to the root cap. We 

believe that the root cap incorporated Cu from the seed coat during the radical emergence. It 

is also noteworthy mentioning that the incorporation and diffusion of Cu could be favored by 

the chemical properties of mucilage, especially in the soluble form. The chemical images also 

showed that the Cu transferred to the root cap had low mobility. Part of the Cu could have 

been transferred to the meristem, site of intense cell division activity, which at low 

concentrations may have favored root growth while at high concentration it might have 

prevented it. Previous experiments carried out by Wang and colleagues, in the model species 

Arabidopsis thaliana, showed that nCuO treatments induce modulation of auxin related genes, 

supporting the idea  that changes in root growth rates are related to the modulation  of auxin 

sensing and root size control.

2.3.7 Chemical reactivity of Cu based nanoparticles and  physiological effects 

The deleterious effects of the 25 nm  CuO nanoparticles at 100 and 1 000 mg Cu L-1 

could not be explained by the treatment concentration, since a different  behavior was found 

for 40 and 80 nm nCuO. The crystal phase  effects could not be accessed in the present study 

since for all particles the CuO were monoclinic. However, the literature indicated that for 

rutile and anatase TiO2 the crystal phase did not influence the uptake and translocation of 

TiO2 in wheat.
44   

Figure 2.17 shows the degradation of H2O2 by the CuO nanoparticle dispersions used 

to prime the seeds. The 40 and  80 nm nCuO presented similar behavior, taking nearly 300 

min  to produce 7.9 and 8.5 mL of O2, respectively. CuSO4 produced 18.5 mL of O2 in 180 

min. The most reactive nanoparticle was the 25 nm CuO that readily produced 18.5 mL of O2 
in 30 min. The surface properties of core?shell structures can greatly differ from those 

exhibited by single phase materials. For example, the catalytic activity of Ru?Cu 

nanoparticles in converting NH3 into N2 and H2 depends on the number of Cu layers on top of 

Ru.45 Facing the low solubility shown by all Cu-based nanoparticles used in the present study 

and the similar results obtained for the 40 and 80 nm CuO particles, we hypothesize that the 

deleterious effects of the 25 nm particles may be caused by their modified surface properties.

Considering the excess of Cu ions, the deleterious effects can be explained in the light 

of previous studies. The literature reports after 5 days of germination under normal conditions, 

an increase in protein and aminoacid content in Phaseolus beans.46 On the other hand, 

cotyledons of germinating bean seeds (Phaseolus vulgaris) exposed to 200 µM CuCl2 (26.9 

mg L-1) showed protein damage and oxidative stress. In common beans, Cu toxicity caused 

inactivation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, an important nonlysosomal proteolytic 

system, and inhibition of leucine and proline aminopeptidase activities. These injuries led to a 

deficiency in the cell’s capability to remove oxidatively damaged proteins.47 Oxidative stress 

was also found in lettuce treated with nCuO at 20 mg L-1. Cu reduced catalase and ascorbate 

peroxidase activities, two important antioxidant enzymes.33 Nevertheless, our chemical 

speciation did not detect Cu binding to proteins. The chemical environments were mostly 

similar to those of pristine materials. It means that in the case Cu?protein interaction actually 

happened, the fraction of Cu playing this role was below the XAS detection limit. In linear 

combination analysis of XAS, a component weighting less than 5% would be hardly 

detectable, since normalization can introduce errors on the order of 10%. 

Besides preventing the development of P. vulgaris, Cu based treatments led to 

reduction of the content of Ca, Fe, K, Mn, Zn, carbohydrates, and amino acids as was also 

observed in the embryonic axis of seeds exposed to excess Cu (5 mmol L-1 or 672.2 mg L-1 of 

CuCl2). Oxidative damage may be enhanced in Cu-intoxicated tissues and affect membrane 

integrity due to the lipid peroxidation process, which induces solute leakage from germinating 

seeds.48  



47	
  
	
  

	
  

Chemical imaging combined with spectroscopic speciation showed that although Cu 

was located in small hotspots instead of being spread homogeneously throughout the tissues, 

and most of the incorporated Cu remained in its pristine form, it strongly affected the 

germination of the seeds and the growth of the seedlings. As discussed above, it is likely that 

low  concentrations of promptly available Cu ions may have  impaired the proper functioning 

of proteins.  

 

2.4 Conclusions 

In agreement to the published literature, the present study  shows that much attention 

has to be paid to the concentration  of the nanoparticles used in seed priming. At 

concentrations  from 1 to 100 mg Cu L-1, 40 and 80 nm nCuO did not harm  the seed 

germination and seedling development, while 40 nm  nCuO at 100 mg Cu L-1 favored weight 

gain. The 80 nm  nCuO did not affect weight gain, although it was able to increase 

concentrations in the embryo to 40 ± 9 mg Cu kg-1.  This might be a consequence of the slow 

release of Cu ions  from the oxide structure to the physiological solution.  Therefore, Cu in 

these oxide forms can be used by the  developing seedling instead of intoxicating it, different 

from what happened for CuSO4 at 1 000 mg Cu L
-1 which prevented seedling growth. Hence, 

depending on its physical-chemical  properties, CuO based nanoparticles might be considered 

for  seed priming rather than soluble Cu sources, since the possibility of phytotoxicity by the 

latter is higher.  

The current study also highlighted the importance of the  structure and chemical nature 

of the nanoparticle. The effects of 25 nm nCuO, which presented a metallic core covered by 

an  oxide shell structure, deserve further investigation. This  nanoparticle, probably due to its 

higher surface reactivity, had  deleterious effects on bean seedling development. These results 

reinforce the necessity of care regarding the disposal of  nanoparticles in the environment and 

their usage as fertilizers.

3 BEAN SEEDLING GROWTH ENHANCEMENT USING MAGNETITE 

NANOPARTICLES 

 

Abstract 

Advanced fertilizers are one of the top requirements to address rising global food demand. 

This study investigates the effect of bare and polyethylene glycol-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles 

on the germination and seedling development of Phaseolus vulgaris L. Although the 

germination rate was not affected by the treatments (1 to 1 000 mg Fe L-1), seed soaking in 

Fe3O4-PEG at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 increased radicle elongation (8.1± 1.1 cm vs. 5.9 ± 1.0 cm for 

the control). Conversely, Fe2+/Fe3+(aq) and bare Fe3O4 at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 prevented the growth. 

X-ray spectroscopy and tomography showed that Fe penetrated in the seed. Enzymatic assays 

showed that Fe3O4-PEG was least harmful treatment to ?-amylase. The growth promoted by 

the Fe3O4-PEG might be related to water uptake enhancement induced by the PEG coating. 

These results show the potential of using coated iron nanoparticles to enhance the growth of 

common food crops. 

 

Keywords: Phaseolus vulgaris L. Fe3O4 nanoparticle. Polyethylene glycol. Germination. X-

ray spectroscopy.

3.1 Introduction 

The population growth is pushing agriculture worldwide to intensify the use of 

chemical fertilizers in order to meet the increasing food demand. A large portion of fertilizers 

applied into the soil is lost by water leaching, strong adsorption, or in case of nitrogen 

sources, by evaporation. This loss affects negatively the environment, the sustainability of 

mineral inputs and the economic performance of agricultural activity. In this context, nano-

sized fertilizers can become an alternative to increase plant uptake ratio. Thus, paving the way 

to a more sustainable strategy to improve nutrient delivery.1 

Nutrient seed priming is an option to deliver micronutrients to plants. A proper supply 

of micronutrients during the earlier growth stages may improve seedling emergence, grain 

yield and nutritional content.2 Nutrient primed seeds have been shown to increase yield of 

maize,3 oat,4 wheat5; 6 and rice.7 Seedlings obtain nutrients partly from seed reserves and 

partly from soil. An adequate nutrient reserve in the seed is necessary to sustain seedling 

growth until roots starts the nutrient supply function.8 Although seed priming is commonly 

practiced by farmers, and a fairly investigated topic, we did not find any model explaining 

how the nutrients applied to seeds migrate to the plant.  

Fe is mostly found as Fe3+ oxides and oxyhydroxides in cultivated (aerated) soils.9 

Despite of their abundancy, compounds such as goethite, ferrihydrite and hematite presents 

Ksp values ranging from 10-37 to 10-44, which make them virtually insoluble. Even though the 

total Fe content is high, its availability to plants is still low. The availability of Fe is also 

influenced by the crystallite size and degree of isomorphic substitution.10 It has been reported 

that rates of dissolution decrease with the following order: ferrihydrite &gt; lepidocrocite &gt; 

magnetite &gt; hematite &gt; goethite.11 

Even though Fe3+ is more available than Fe2+, for most plants the preferred absorption 

form is Fe2+.9 Iron uptake differs for nongraminaceous and graminaceous plants. For the 

former, plant species take up Fe via three mechanisms: (i) excreting protons from the roots to 

the rhizosphere, reducing the soil solution pH and thus increasing Fe3+solubility; (ii) reducing 

Fe3+ to Fe2+ by Fe3+-chelate reductase; and (iii) plasmalemma transport of Fe2+ by iron 

transporters. On the other hand, roots of graminaceous species release phytosiderophores that 

chelate Fe3+ in the rhizosphere, and then specific plasmalemma transporters take the Fe3+-

phytosiderophores complexes.1; 12

Iron is an essential element for plants. Its deficiency can limit plant development and 

reduce grain yield.13 It plays an important role in the photosynthetic activity, biosynthesis of 

many enzymes, Fe-S protein clusters and hemeproteins like cytochromes. It is required in 

chloroplast thylakoids structure and chlorophyll synthesis.9 The legume–rhizobium  

symbiosis is sensitive to Fe deficiency,14 Fe seems to be involved in nitrogen fixation through 

enzymes such as nitrogenase, nitrogen reductase and leghemoglobin.15 

In common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) Fe concentration in grains and shoot tissue is 

around 76 mg kg-1 and 154 mg kg-1,16 respectively. It means that at least ca. 653 g Fe ha-1 are 

necessary for the proper culture development (the consulted data did not include Fe 

concentration in roots, thus this is a lower boundary estimation). Since this nutrient is required 

in large quantities, seed priming can only supply part of plants requirements, especially for 

the early phenological states. High loads of nutrients via seed treatment can induce phytotoxic 

effects.17; 18; 19  

Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles are currently used in drug delivery systems, 

contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging, hyperthermia treatments, the production of 

magnetic inks and magnetic seals in motors, to name a few applications.20 In all instances, 

iron nanoparticle effects vary according to their chemical composition, size, morphology, 

aggregation state, applied concentration as well as experimental conditions like temperature 

and time of exposure. Nano magnetite was chosen for this study because of it is a well-

characterized nanomaterial. It is easy to synthetize, relatively cheap and used in several types 

of applications, especially biotechnological ones.21; 22; 23; 24; 25   

In the agricultural scenario, the effects of iron nanoparticles have been observed in the 

uptake, transport, accumulation and development of plant species. It has been previously 

demonstrated that iron oxide nanoparticles accumulated in pumpkin plants tissues,26 

stimulated the development of peanut27 and watermelon28 seedlings, but did not affect growth 

and chlorophyll content of lettuce.22  

Magnetite nanoparticles are prone to aggregation due to a combined effect of their 

high surface area to volume ratio and their strong magnetization, which however limits t 

heir use for bio-applications.29 To address the former problem, magnetite nanoparticles are  

usually synthesized in the presence of surfactants, forming a coating layer preventing 

aggregation. Common surfactants are polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), 

Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), chitosan and dextran.21  

  



56	
  

Among them, PEG is a hydrophilic polymer widely used for biomedical applications, 

being biocompatible, non-immunogenic, and non-antigenic.30 

In this work, we report the effect of Fe3O4-PEG and bare Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the 

germination and seedling development of Phaseolus vulgaris L. seeds. The effects of 1, 10, 

100 and 1 000 mg Fe L-1 seed soaking treatments were observed on the germination rate, 

radicle elongation and ?-amylase activity of 5-days old seedlings. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) 

and absorption (XANES) spectroscopy, X-ray tomography and scanning electron microscopy 

(SEM-EDX) uncovered the Fe uptake and spatial distribution. 

 

3.2 Materials and Methods 

3.2.1 Synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles 

Bare magnetite nanoparticles (nFe3O4) were synthetized by a co-precipitation method 

using a mixture of iron (III) chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl2·4H2O) and iron (II) chloride 

hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O), both purchased from Sigma-Aldrich at a 2:1 molar ratio of 

Fe3+:Fe2+, mFeCl3 = 7.00 g, mFeCl2= 2.58 g in 300 ml DI water. The solution was poured in a 

three-neck round bottom flask provided with a condenser, nitrogen and liquid inlets. Then  

0.5 ml of a 37 % wt. HCl were added under gentle agitation. Oxygen was purged using 

nitrogen for 20 minutes prior the addition of 100 ml 1.5 M NH4OH. The solution quickly 

turned black, indicating the beginning of the production of the nanoparticles. The reaction 

lasted 1 hour at 20 ?C and nitrogen was supplied during the whole reaction. After the 

synthesis, the nanoparticles were washed using cycles of deoxygenated DI water and 

magnetic decantation. Then, the nanoparticles were dried at room temperature under vacuum 

for 24 h and immediately characterized. 

A slightly modified procedure was used to produce Fe3O4-PEG nanoparticles  

(nFe3O4-PEG), which consisted in dissolving the iron salts in 300 ml of a 10 % wt PEG 

(Mw10 000) in DI water solution prior the addition of NH4OH. Reaction and washing 

conditions were the same as described above.  

 

3.2.2 Characterization of pristine Fe3O4 nanoparticles and dispersions 

The composition of each set of nanoparticles was determined by energy dispersive  

X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (EDXRF; EDX-720 Shimadzu, Japan). Two hundred 

milligrams of pristine powders were weighted in a 6.3 mm aperture X-ray fluorescence

spectroscopy (XRF) sample cup (no. 3577 - Spex Ind. Inc., USA) sealed with a 5 µm thick 

polypropylene film (no. 3520 - Spex Ind. Inc., USA). The samples were analyzed using a 

rhodium (Rh) X-ray tube at 50 kV and auto-tunable current adjusted for a detector deadtime 

below 30% and a 3-mm collimator. The X-ray spectrum of the sample was acquired utilizing 

a Si (Li) detector for 200 s. The analyses were carried out in triplicate and the quantitative 

method selected was the fundamental parameters. 

Nanoparticle size and morphology were evaluated via transmission electron 

microscopy (TEM; JEOL, JEM-2100 Plus, USA). 

Crystal size and phase identification were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), 

using a Bruker D8-Advance diffractometer (Bruker-AXS GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) with 

Cu K? radiation. Measurements were recorded for 2? values from 20 to 80?. Using the 

broadening of the peaks it was possible to estimate the crystallite size by the Scherrer 

equation:  

D(hkl) = K? / ?cos? 

 

where D is the mean crystal size of the nanoparticles, K the Scherrer constant (0.94 for 

spherical crystals with cubic symmetry ), ? the wavelength of light used for the diffraction 

(0.154184 nm to Cu), ? the full width at half maximum of the peak, and ? refers to the angle 

measured. 

The coated and uncoated magnetite nanoparticles were suspended in deionized water 

and dispersed using an ultrasonic processor (model 705 Sonic Dismembrator, Fisher 

Scientific, USA) under 50% amplitude for 15 min, with 30 s interval every minute, at 1, 10, 

100 and 1 000 mg Fe L-1. The hydrodynamic size and the zetapotential of the nanomaterials at 

100 mg Fe L-1 were analyzed via dynamic light scattering (DLS; Zetasizer Nano, Malvern 

Instruments, UK). 

 

3.2.3 Germination assay 

The effects of nFe3O4 and nFe3O4-PEG on the germination of Phaseolus vulgaris L. 

seeds were evaluated. Since one-third of the Fe atoms in magnetite occurs as Fe2+ and two-

thirds occur as Fe3+,31 an iron ionic reference treatment (herein referred as soluble-Fe)  

was prepared as a mixture of one-third of FeSO4.7H2O and two-thirds of Fe2(SO4)3.nH2O, 

both purchased from Reagen (Brazil). 

  



58	
  

Phaseolus vulgaris L. seeds, cultivar Sintonia, were supplied by the Agronomic 

Institute of Campinas (IAC), presented an average germination rate of 80%. This seed was 

chosen as model species because of its low dormancy, which results in a plant of small size 

and short growth cycle, i.e. an ideal test case. In addition, P. vulgaris is an important and 

accessible source of protein.32   

Seeds were first immersed in a 10% NaClO solution under stirring for 10 s for 

disinfection, followed by rinsing with deionized water. Subsequently, twenty seeds were 

soaked for 20 min in the appropriate concentration of nFe3O4 and nFe3O4-PEG dispersions. 

Soluble-Fe solutions at the same concentrations were used as a positive control, whereas 

deionized water was used as a negative control. After exposure, the seeds were placed on a 

15-cm paper filter fitted on the bottom of a Petri dish, and 8 mL of the soaking solution was 

added to moisturize the paper filter. The Petri dishes were sealed with Parafilm M (Bemis 

Company Inc., USA), inserted into a plastic bag preventing water loss, and finally incubated 

in a germination chamber (TE-4020, Tecnal, BR) under dark and ventilation at 27 °C for five 

days. Five replicates of the experiment were conducted per treatment. 

Five days after the sowing the assay was completed and the number of germinated 

seeds counted to determine the rate of germination. The radicle length of the seedlings was 

measured, manually removed and weighted. Afterwards, radicles and seeds were both rinsed 

with deionized water to remove the surface-bound metal or nano metal oxide and then dried 

in a laboratory oven (515/4A, FANEM, Brazil) at 60 °C for two days.  

 

3.2.4 Radicle length determination 

At the end of the germination period, the five replicates of seedlings from each 

treatment were separately transferred to a black cardboard, then a HP Scanjet 2410 scanner 

operated by Photosmart software was used to obtain scanned images of the seedlings. The 

radicle length (cm) of the seedlings was determined through the digitized images using the 

Seed Vigor Imaging System software (SVIS®).33 

 

3.2.5 Iron uptake quantification 

Each treatment replicates were grouped and the dried seedlings carefully separated in 

three fractions: cotyledon, seed coat and radicle. The cotyledons were then ground using a 

mortar mill (MA890, Marconi, Brazil). One gram of each component was weighed in a 

decontaminated porcelain crucible and then digested by dry ashing method using a muffle 



59	
  
	
  

	
  

furnace (F-2, Fornitec, Brazil) at 100 °C h-1 ramp rate up to 550°C and then ashed for 14 h. 

Each dry ashing digestion batch included a blank to ensure no contamination. The ashes were 

dissolved in 5 mL of 1 M HNO3(aq), then 200 µL of this solution plus 750 µL of ultra pure 

water was transferred into a 1.5 mL vial, and 50 µL of 1 000 mg Ga L-1 was added as an 

internal standard. Then, the sample was homogenized using a tube shaker vortex (MA162, 

Marconi, Brazil). 

The Fe content of the digested samples was determined by EDXRF. For that, 10 µL of 

the digests were pipetted on the external side of the window of a 6.3 mm XRF sample cup 

(no. 3577 - Spex Ind. Inc., USA) and sealed with a 5 µm thick polypropylene film (no. 3520 - 

Spex Ind. Inc., USA). The cups were then left drying in a laboratory oven at 60°C. The 

samples were triplicate analyzed using a rhodium (Rh) X-ray tube at 50 kV and auto-tunable 

current with a deadtime at 30% and a 3-mm collimator. The X-ray spectrum of the sample 

was acquired utilizing a Si (Li) detector for 200 s. The quantification was performed using 

external standard calibration. The trueness of this method was assessed analyzing two 

certified reference materials: apple leaves (NIST 1515) and peach leaves (NIST 1547). 

 

3.2.6 nFe3O4 solubility 

To verify the Fe solubility of nFe3O4 and nFe3O4-PEG, aqueous dispersions of 15 mL 

were prepared at 100 and 1 000 mg Fe L-1 using a probe ultrasonic device (Fisher Scientific™ 

Model 705 Sonic Dismembrator). The equipment was operated at 95 W (amplitude of 50 %) 

and 50 J, during 15 x 1 min with an interval of 30 s between each cycle. After 24 hours, one 

milliliter of each dispersion was transferred to Eppendorf tubes and then centrifuged by a 

microcentrifuge (Mikro 120, Hettich, Germany) for 60 minutes at 13 000 rpm.  

Quantitative analysis of the supernatants was performed by EDXRF (EDX-720, 

Shimadzu, Japan). Fifteen milliliters of the supernatants were dripped in a 6.3 window cuvette 

(no. 3577 - Spex Ind. Inc., USA) assembled with a five micrometer thick polypropylene film, 

and dried at 60°C in a laboratory oven. After repeating this procedure twice, the samples were 

measured using the same experimental condition of nFe3O4 characterization. The 

quantification was performed using external standard calibration and Ga as internal standard. 

The measurements were performed in triplicate.

3.2.7 Mapping Fe accumulation spots 

The seeds were exposed to nFe3O4, nFe3O4-PEG and soluble-Fe at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 for 

20 min, dried at room temperature and gently cut in the middle using a stainless steel blade. 

Subsequently, the seeds were placed on a sample holder with a Kapton tape and the 

cotyledon’s inner side exposed for analysis. 

The microanalysis was carried out using a benchtop microprobe X-ray fluorescence 

spectrometer (µ-XRF) system (Orbis PC EDAX, USA) operated with a Rh X-ray tube  

at 40 kV and 300 µA and using a 25 µm Ni filter. A polycapillary optic provided a 30 µm  

X-ray beam spot size. The detection was carried out by a 30 mm2 silicon drift detector  

(140 eV FWHM at the 5.9 keV Mn-K? line) with a deadtime of nearly 3%. Maps were 

registered using a matrix of 64x50 pixels (number of analyzed points on xy- axes) and dwell 

time per pixel of 1 s.  

Additionally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded using a 

JEOL JSM-5600LV SEM. The hilum of the bean seeds was removed using a razor blade and 

transversally cut. The samples were coated with Au and placed in the stubs for measurements. 

The chemical composition of specific parts of the imaged tissues were determined using the 

X-ray energy disperse detector (EDX) of the microscope.  

 

3.2.8 3D distribution and chemical speciation of Fe in the hilum 

Common beans have a hilum associated to the seed coat, and near the hilum there is 

the micropyle, a small pore that allows water uptake into the seed.34 We employed X-ray 

tomography to verify the 3D distribution of Fe in the hilum region of treated seeds, and the 

chemical speciation of Fe in the hilum was performed by means of X-ray absorption near 

edge spectroscopy (XANES). 

Common bean seeds were exposed to nFe3O4-PEG and soluble-Fe at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 

for 20 min and dried at room temperature. A small fraction of the seed coat containing the 

hilum were carefully collected and cut using a razor blade. 

Tomograms were acquired at the X-ray imaging beamline (IMX) at the 1.37 GeV 

Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS, Campinas, Brazil). At IMX beamline, 

synchrotron radiation was generated by a bending-magnet. The measurements were carried 

out using a pink beam from 4 to 14 keV and 1024 projections were taken under 180o rotation. 

The exposure time was 300 ms per projection. The image was magnified and focused on a 



61	
  
	
  

	
  

cooled camera detector (CCD; PCO.2000, PCO, Germany). Pictures of the sample holders 

containing the seed coat fractions and the experimental X-ray tomography setup are presented 

in the electronic Supporting Information of Duran et al.35 

To complement these data, the same samples were also submitted to µ-XRF mapping. 

The analysis parameters and experimental setup were the same as above mentioned (mapping 

Fe accumulation spots). 

The XANES measurements were carried out at the Fe K edge in fluorescence mode at 

XAFS2 beamline of LNLS (Brazil). At this experimental station the X-rays are generated by 

dipole bending magnet, the higher harmonics are rejected by a set of mirrors, the energy was 

selected by a Si(111) monochromator and the X-ray beam was focused to a spot of ca.  

500 µm by a Rh coated mirror. The fluorescence was detected by a 15 element Ge solid state 

Canberra detector. The spectra were energy calibrated using a Fe foil, normalized and 

subjected to linear combination analysis from -20 to 50 eV above the edge. The reference 

compounds were nFe3O4-PEG and the pristine bean. We also measured pelletized nFe3O4 and 

iron (II) and (III) sulfates. The analysis was accomplished using the IFEFFIT code.36  

 

3.2.9 Reactivity of soluble-Fe and magnetite nanoparticles  

The reactivity of the soluble-Fe and magnetite nanoparticles was evaluated measuring 

their ability to decompose H2O237 through a Fenton-like reaction.38 In a 25 mL round-bottom 

reaction flask, 19.5 mL of a 1 000 mg Fe L-1 aqueous dispersion of the tested nanoparticles 

and soluble-Fe solution was magnetically stirred. The flask was connected to a 25 mL 

graduated pipette through a silicone tube. The pipette was immersed in a measuring cylinder 

water column. Then, 0.5 mL of 30% v/v H2O2 solution was inserted in the reaction flask with 

a syringe. The volume of the produced O2 was monitored by following the shift of a water 

column in pipette.  

 

3.2.10 ?-amylase activity  

The evaluations for the ?-amylase enzyme followed the recommendations of Fuwa.39 

P. vulgaris seeds were soaked in nFe3O4, nFe3O4-PEG and soluble-Fe at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 for 

20 min and then germinated in paper rolls inside a germination chamber (Mangelsdorf, 

DeLeo, Brazil) at 25°C. The experiment was quadruplicate conducted with 20 seeds per 

replicate. The seedlings were collected on the 7th day after sowing, subsequently nearly 1 g 

were weighed and macerated using a mortar and pestle in a phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.9) 



62	
  

at a 9:1 (distilled water: buffer) ratio. This material was centrifuged for 4 min at 12 000 g  

(NT 805, Novatecnica, Brazil), then the supernatant was removed for the enzymatic analysis, 

and 1% starch solution was used as substrate. The value of 1 U (Enzymatic Unit) was 

considered to be the reduction of 10% of the colorimetric intensity of the amylose-iodine 

complex. 

 

3.2.11 Statistical analysis  

The number of germinated seeds and the radicle length and weight data were 

submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s multiple range tests at 95% 

confidence interval using the Action Stat software (version 3.3.111.1178, Estatcamp, BR). 

 

3.3 Results and Discussion 

3.3.1 Characterization of the nanoparticles and dispersions 

The purity of the nFe3O4 and Fe3O4-PEG was determined by EDXRF. Considering the 

limits of detection of the method, ca. of mg kg-1, no contaminants were found in the 

nanoparticles. Figure 3.1 presents the XRF spectra of these samples. XRD patterns, presented 

in Figure 3.2, showed an average crystallite size in the direction of the plane (220) of 11.6 nm 

for the uncoated and 13.9 nm for coated magnetite nanoparticles, respectively (see the 

crystallite size in the direction of the other planes in Table 3.1). These results were in 

agreement with the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations (Figure 3.3),  

with presumed average particle size of 11 nm for nFe3O4 and 12 nm for Fe3O4-PEG.

The DLS measurements (Table 3.2) revealed the hydrodynamic diameter of the 

nanoparticles in aqueous dispersion. The discrepancy between nanoparticle size shown by 

TEM and that measured by the DLS indicates particle aggregation. Such behavior and 

aggregate sizes are in agreement with reported values of 208 ± 15 nm for 50-60 nm nFe3O4 

suspended in water at 10 mg L-1 and 438 ± 13 nm at 20 mg L-1.22 One could visually observe 

that such aggregates make these magnetite dispersions very unstable. At 1 000 mg Fe L-1, 

most particles were settled after 60 min, even in the nFe3O4-PEG case.  

The aggregation is controlled by an equilibrium between particles attraction (Van der 

Walls forces) and repulsion (surface changes or steric hindrance).40; 41 The pH registered for 

the uncoated magnetite dispersion and coated one were 5.58, and 5.08, respectively. 

Normally, for a same material lower pH values should lead to more positive zeta potentials.42 

Zeta-potential measurements indicated that the uncoated magnetite presented a negative 

value, whereas the PEG coated presented positive value. Thus, the sign of surface charges of 

Fe3O4-PEG was determined by the coating rather than by the pH. The measured ?-potential 

for the uncoated samples was different from values reported in the literature, 4.31 ± 0.05 mV 

for the less concentrated dispersion (10 mg L-1) and 3.99 ± 0.4 mV for the highest one  

(20 mg L-1).22

3.3.2 Effects of magnetite nanoparticles on P. vulgaris seed germination and radicle 
growth 

The number of germinated seeds was counted daily and all the radicles emerged 

almost in the same period. At the end of the germination assay, the deionized water treatment 

control gave an average germination rate of 88.8% (Figure 3.4). All the others treatments had 

higher or comparable values to the negative control. The highest germination rate was found 

for 1 mg Fe L-1 of nFe3O4 and 10 mg Fe L-1 of nFe3O4-PEG (97 and 96%, respectively). 

However, under ANOVA statistical analysis, no difference was found among treatments and 

controls (p&amp;lt;0.05). 

 

Figure 3.4 - Germination rate of P. vulgaris seeds exposed to nFe3O4, nFe3O4-PEG, soluble-Fe (1, 10, 
100 and 1 000 mg Fe L-1) and H2O after 5 days of germination 

 

 



66	
  

Although the treatments did not affect the germination rate, a different scenario was 

observed in the radicle elongation of the seedlings. The phenotypic images of the seedlings 

after 5 days of Fe treatments exposure (Figure 3.5) indicate that the highest applied 

concentration was toxic for the seedlings development, while it was not observed for the 

nFe3O4-PEG treatment. 

Figure 3.5 - Seedlings of P. vulgaris whose seeds were soaked in (a) H2O, (b) nFe3O4, (c) nFe3O4-PEG 
and (d) soluble-Fe. Applied concentrations were 1, 10, 100 and 1 000 mg Fe L-1 

 

 

The average length of the radicle of negative control was 5.9 ± 1.0 cm long, whilst 

nFe3O4 and soluble-Fe at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 shortened it, yielding 2.9 ± 0.5 and 1.2 ± 0.3 cm, 

respectively. Conversely, PEG improved the radicle development even at its higher 

concentration, where the highest radicle elongation of 8.1 ± 1.1 cm was observed (Figure 

3.6a). One of the hypotheses to explain this result regards the hydrophilic nature of the PEG.43 

The polymeric coating might have reduced the water potential, which caused greater water 

absorption by the tissues. If so, it may have aided the root growth by redirecting water to a 

region close to the root of the seedlings. Furthermore, the nanoparticles distribution on seed 

coat was more homogeneous where PEG was added. This allowed a controlled absorption of 

nFe3O4, by reducing the water surface tension.44 

After the length measurements, the radicles were removed and weighed (Figure 3.6b). 

The same trend was observed for length and weight, radicles from water treatment presented 

1.94 ± 0.13 g and nFe3O4 at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 had 0.82 ± 0.09 g. According to the Tukey's test 

(p&amp;lt;0.05), radicle length was significantly different from the control at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 for all 



67	
  
	
  

	
  

the tested materials, positively for nFe3O4-PEG and negatively for nFe3O4 and soluble-Fe 

treatments (Figure 3.7). However, radicle weight data were only statistically different from 

control for nFe3O4 and soluble-Feat 1 000 mg Fe L-1 (Figure 3.8). 

 

Figure 3.6 - (a) Radicle length and (b) weight of P. vulgaris seedlings whose seeds were soaked in 
nFe3O4, nFe3O4-PEG, soluble-Fe (1, 10, 100 and 1 000 mg Fe L

The phytotoxicity observed for high concentrations of soluble-Fe and nFe3O4 might be 

related to the Fe accumulation in the seed tissues. Such conclusion is reinforced by the fact 

that the absorption of soluble-Fe occurs mainly by the micropyle, determinant structure for 

water imbibition by seeds,45 mainly in the initial stages of the germination process as will be 

discussed in depth below. 

Studies reported root shortening as a response to the increase of nanoparticles 

concentration in the dispersion, as demonstrated for ZnO,46; 47 Ag,48 CuO17; 49 and TiO2.50  

The anomalous behavior found for Fe in the present study was also observed for white 

mustard, where the root elongation of the seedlings treated with the highest nFe3O4 

concentrations (100 and 1 000 mg L-1) was higher than the lower tested concentration  

(10 mg L-1), however the difference was not statistically significant.25 On the other hand, 

soybean and rice seeds treated with ?-Fe2O3 nanoparticles at 500, 1 000 and 2 000 mg L-1 

developed seedlings with the root elongation significantly higher than the control.51; 52 

Nano zerovalent iron at 5 000 mg L-1 also promoted the root elongation of Arabidopsis 

thaliana by 150-200% compared to the control, with the elongation caused by hydroxyl 

radical-induced cell-wall loosening.53 Other authors observed that ?-Fe2O3 nanoparticles 

promoted the growth of peanut by regulating the antioxidant enzyme activity and the content 



69	
  
	
  

	
  

of abscisic acid, a phytohormone that stimulates the senescence and reduces the metabolism. 

The peanut root dry biomass was increased by Fe2O3 nanoparticles at 1 000 mg kg-1 applied to 

the soil.54 

Since PEG is hydrophilic, it can prevent the nFe3O4-PEG from interacting with cells 

and/or proteins.30 The surface chemistry modification of iron oxide nanoparticles by PEG 

reduced the cytotoxicity and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the cell length 

being not affected compared to the ones treated with bare nanoparticles.55 Also, it was 

previously shown that the uptake of PEG-coated magnetite by macrophage cells was much 

lower than that of uncoated nanoparticles.23; 24 

 

3.3.3 Determination of Fe uptake by P. vulgaris seeds 

After the germination assays, the seedling tissues were divided and the Fe content was 

determined. Figure 3.9 presents the concentration of Fe in the (a) seed coat, (b) cotyledon and 

(c) radicle of the seedlings exposed to nFe3O4, nFe3O4-PEG, soluble-Fe and water negative 

control.  

The negative control (deionized water) revealed that Fe was more concentrated in the 

seed coat of the tested common beans than in the other tissues analyzed. It presented  

92.3 ± 0.6 mg Fe kg-1 in contrast to 46.6 ± 1.4 mg Fe kg-1 in the cotyledons and 72.8 ± 0.5 mg 

Fe kg-1 in the radicle. In the case of the seedlings with nanoparticle treatment, the ones soaked 

in nFe3O4 presented similar Fe content in the three analyzed regions regardless of the applied 

concentration. The difference between the water control and nFe3O4 treatment reached a 

maximum value of 50% in the seed coat sample soaked in 1 000 mg Fe L-1. It reached more 

than 6000-fold higher for the soluble-Fe treatment. For the highest treatment concentration, 

the incorporation of Fe from the nFe3O4-PEG in the seed coat and in the radicle was 

intermediate between those of nFe3O4 and soluble-Fe.

vulgaris seeds soaked in nFe3O4, nFe3O4-PEG and soluble-Fe at 1 000 mg Fe L

-1 and H2O 

 

 

 

Priming rice seeds with Zn also substantially increased the Zn concentration in the 

husk, but not in the endosperm. This study suggests that part of the Zn accumulated in the 

husk during the priming process can be transported to the endosperm during the germination. 

It was stated since the Zn concentration declined at the same time that increased in the 

endosperm, and this was not the case of unprimed seeds.56 

To estimate the contribution of dissolved Fe on the seedling development and  

Fe uptake, solubility tests in deionized water were performed. For nFe3O4 and nFe3O4-PEG 

dispersions at 100 and 1 000 mg Fe L-1, the soluble Fe fractions were not quantitatively 

detected, i.e. they were below the limit of quantification of the method (0.15 mg Fe L-1).  

A study carried out by Landa et al.25 found soluble-Fe fractions at 6.51 ± 2.24 mg Fe L-1 in 

the supernatant of a cultivation medium supplemented with nFe3O4 at 1 000 mg L-1.  



71	
  
	
  

	
  

Anyhow, it is important to keep in mind that the presence of other molecules can induce the 

generation of soluble complexes with Fe. 

 

3.3.4 Spatial distribution and chemical speciation of Fe in the primed seeds 

Figure 3.10 presents the internal side of the cotyledon of a P. vulgaris seeds soaked for 

20 min in (a) nFe3O4-PEG and (b) soluble-Fe at 1 000 mg Fe L-1. The results corroborate the 

quantitative analysis, indicating that the treatments concentrated Fe in the seed coat, mainly in 

the hilum region, and the number of XRF counts was almost 5-fold higher for the soluble-Fe 

treatment compared to the nanoparticle one.

72	
  

Additional µ-XRF chemical maps were recorded specifically in the hilum region of the 

treated seeds. The images of the Fe distribution in the hilum revealed a different pattern of 

distribution between seeds soaked in nFe3O4-PEG dispersion and soluble-Fe solution at 1 000 

mg Fe L-1 (Figure 3.11). The nanoparticle treatment presented Fe mainly concentrated in the 

edge around the hilum (Figure 3.11a), while soluble-Fe presented a hotspot in the micropyle 

(Figure 3.11b). Another study using magnetic resonance microscopy showed that during the 

imbibition process, water enters the P. vulgaris seed through the micropyle57. Thus, we 

conclude that this structure acted also as a channel for soluble Fe ions.

at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 and its corresponding µ-XRF chemical maps for Fe 

 

 

The hilum is a sponge-like tissue, thus besides sticking on the tissue’s outer surface, 

the nanoparticles can penetrate through the channels reaching the seed’s internal layers.  

In spite of X-ray fluorescence’s high analytical sensitivity, it yielded only 2D maps. The  

6.4 keV K? photons emitted by Fe atoms embedded in the seed coat can escape from a depth 

that lies in the mm range. Images such as these shown in Figure 3.11 cannot specify whether 

Fe is only adsorbed on the surface of the seed coat or also inside the hilum tissue.

Hence, the hilum region of treated seeds was subjected to further X-ray tomography 

analysis. Figure 3.12 shows 3D projections and slices of phase contrast tomography for the 

seed coat of seeds soaked in (a) nFe3O4-PEG and (b) soluble-Fe at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 for  

20 min. The green regions, highlighted by the red circles, indicate the presence of Fe that 

penetrated within the hilum sponge tissue. This can be observed for both nFe3O4-PEG and 

soluble-Fe. The combination of µ-XRF and X-ray tomography unequivocally showed that Fe 

supplied under nanoparticle format could enter in the seeds.

nanoparticle and (b) soluble-Fe at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 dispersion for 20 min. The green spots highlighted 
by the red circles indicates the presence of Fe embedded in the organic tissue 

 

 

X-ray tomography was previously employed to understand physiological seed 

development of rice,58 maize59 and oilseed rape,60 observe germination behavior of sugar beet 

seeds,61 and also to analyze archaeological seeds in the investigation of crop domestication.62; 

63 However, to the best of our knowledge, no other study examined 3D images of a 

nanoparticle-treated bean seed, although some researchers used this technique to verify the 

uptake and distribution of gold and yttrium nanoparticles in Arabidopsis thaliana64 and 

cabbage plants.65

The chemical form of Fe trapped in the hilum was evaluated by Fe K edge XANES. 

Figure 3.13a shows the XANES spectra for the control bean (pristine without any treatment), 

nFe3O4-PEG, Fe2(SO4)3 and Fe(SO4) reference compounds. The spectral features are a 

function of the chemical environment. The energy of the threshold depends on the oxidation 

state, this is the reason why Fe2+ (Fe(SO4)) is shifted towards lower energies compared to 

Fe2(SO4)3. The threshold energy for the control bean and nFe3O4-PEG fall in between Fe2+ 

and Fe3+, which indicates that these two latter samples are composed of mixed iron oxidation 

states. This is well known for magnetite, but to the best of our knowledge it has never been 

reported for bean seeds.   

Figure 3.13b presents the XANES spectrum for the hilum of a seed treated with 

nFe3O4-PEG and its respective linear combination analysis fit. The Fe in the treated hilum can 

be defined as mixture of 75 wt% nFe3O4-PEG and 25 wt% control bean. In spite of its 

capabilities, the XANES ability to distinguish fractions in a linear combination analysis is 

limited. Due to its intrinsic sensibility, XANES would hardly detected fraction below  

5 wt%.66 To assure that the detected Fe was not simply adsorbed on the surface of the hilum, 

the tissue was carefully washed and measured again. Figure 3.13c shows that after successive 

rising, the fraction of nFe3O4-PEG decreased to 47 wt%. This happened because the iron 

particles lying on the surface were removed during the washing process.  

The presence of Fe within the hilum was also confirmed by SEM-EDX. Figure 3.14 

show the images for nFe3O4-PEG treated hilum cross sections. It is possible to distinguish an 

agglomerate of particles; the EDX detector confirmed that this structure was a Fe hotspot 

(Figure 3.14e).  

Thanks to the complementary of spectroscopic and imaging tools, we can state that the 

Fe structures within the hilum are magnetite particles incorporated during the seed treatment.

3.3.5 Chemical reactivity of nFe3O4 and nFe3O4-PEG  

The chemical reactivity of the tested materials was accessed through the volume of O2 

produced during the degradation of H2O2 by the magnetite nanoparticles and soluble-Fe used 

for seed soaking. The most reactive nanoparticle was nFe3O4 which produced 12.4 mL of O2 

in 300 min, while nFe3O4-PEG produced 7.5 mL in the same time. On the other hand, 

soluble-Fe readily produced 22.1 mL in 8 min (Figure 3.15). Iron catalyzes the decomposition 

of H2O2 trough Fenton reaction. The high reactivity of the soluble-Fe is due to the availability 

of free ionic Fe that leads to homogenous Fenton reaction, which is faster than the 

heterogeneous one.67 On the other hand, the lower reactivity of the PEG coated nanoparticles 

may be the result of a lower number of available Fe sites, since the nanoparticle surface is 

sterically hindered by the polymeric chains. This result may explain the non-deleterious 

effects caused by the coated nanoparticles in the radicle elongation, even at high 

concentrations. 

 

Figure 3.15 - H2O2 degradation rate in the presence of nFe3O4, nFe3O4-PEG and soluble-Fe. The 
uncoated magnetite decomposed the H2O2 faster compared to the coated one. However, the former 
were much slower compared to the O2 release from the soluble-Fe 

 

3.3.6 ?-amylase activity 

The energy source necessary for the germination and early seedling development of 

leguminous comes mainly from the degradation of proteins and carbohydrates present  

in the seed reserves. Protein and starch comprise about 20% and 40% of the whole  

P. vulgaris seed, respectively.68 Here we evaluated the ?-amylase (starch degrading enzyme) 



78	
  

activity in the seedlings whose seeds were soaked in nFe3O4, nFe3O4-PEG and soluble-Fe at  

1 000 mg Fe L-1. 

Compared to the result that was obtained for the non-treated seeds (1600 ± 300 U), 

soluble-Fe treatment presented the lowest enzymatic activity, followed by nFe3O4 (730 ± 30 

and 760 ± 140 U, respectively). Reinforcing what was observed in the radicle development 

and in the chemical reactivity analysis, nFe3O4-PEG treatment was the least harmful to  

the ?-amylase activity (900 ± 180 U) (Table 3.3). 

?-amylase is a metalloenzyme which needs Ca2+ to its activity and stability, its affinity 

is much stronger than that with others ions.69 Since Fe2+ is also a divalent ion, its presence in 

abundance could provoke a competition with Ca2+ during the ?-amylase biosynthesis, leading 

to enzymatic activity loss. This possibility is supported by the previously observed reduction 

of amylase activity in vitro in fish intestine after Fe2+ addition (50 mg kg-1).70

PEG and soluble-Fe at 1 000 mg Fe L-1. The value of 1 U (enzymatic activity unit) is the reduction of 
10% of the colorimetric intensity of the amylose-iodine complex

Figure 3.16 attempts to correlate the radicle length and weight to the content of Fe 

incorporated by the seedling tissues. Although the Fe amount in the seedling tissues was very 

similar, the biologic effects were distinct: The deleterious effects caused by 1 000 mg Fe L-1 

soluble-Fe can be attributed to phytotoxicity due the excess of this element, as previously 

discussed. However, the growth promotion induced by nFe3O4-PEG cannot be explained 

solely by the content of Fe incorporated by the seedlings. Since the highest seedling growth 

and weight gain were observed for the nFe3O4-PEG, and this treatment did not yield the 

highest ?-amylase activity, one can infer that the decomposition of starch was not the limiting 

factor for the seedling development.

3.4 Conclusions 

It was previously demonstrated that Cu from CuO nanoparticles was mostly 

concentrated in the seed coat of P. vulgaris seeds after soaking, especially in the hilum 

region.17 In this work, X-ray microtomography and SEM have shown that Fe from magnetite 

nanoparticles was not only absorbed on the surface of the seed coat, but also penetrated the 

hilum tissue, evidence that nanoparticles do enter into the seeds. The chemical identity of the 

incorporated Fe was confirmed by XANES.   

Altogether, the results showed that nanomaterials are potential candidates for seed 

priming. The deleterious effects of magnetite nanoparticles were smaller than those  

shown by aqueous Fe3+/Fe2+. Thus, the supplying of nutrients through sources of intermediate 

solubility makes phytotoxicity less prone to occur. Rather than only transferring nutrients to 

the roots, X-ray fluorescence, XANES, SEM and tomography showed that the  

nanoparticles can penetrate within the seed structure and thus modify the seedling 

development. Finally, the PEG coating played a major role on the properties of the magnetite 

nanoparticles and might be responsible for the growth promotion reported in this study.

4. FINAL REMARKS AND OUTLOOK 

 

The investigation of how plants benefit from seed priming by nanoparticulate nutrients 

is a challenging topic. The results here presented indicate that, beyond the nanoparticle type 

(Cu or Fe), the priming effects on the seedling development of P. vulgaris are strongly 

influenced by the nanoparticle size, surface coverage and the applied concentration.  

The seed priming not only supplied Cu and Fe as nutrient to the seedlings, but also 

affected its growth. Exposing seeds to 40 nm nCuO at 100 mg Cu L-1 and nFe3O4-PEG  

at 1 000 mg Fe L-1 positively affected the seedling development after 5 days of germination, 

whereas 1 000 mg Cu/Fe L-1 for the 25 nCuO and bare magnetite treatments prevented it. 

Although most of the metal oxides are virtually insoluble in water, solubility tests 

carried out by XRF analysis indicated that a small amount of Cu ions were released from 

nCuO dispersions. Interestingly, in this case, the smaller the nanoparticle size, the greater the 

solubility. Albeit ions release may occur in the soaking solution, the promotion and inhibition 

of the seedling development might be a consequence of the slow release of ions from the 

oxide structure to the physiological solution during the germination process.  

The XRF results indicated that most of the incorporated Cu/Fe remains in the seed 

coat, especially in the hilum region, which is the structure responsible for the water entrance 

during the imbibition process. X-ray tomography complemented this data by demonstrating 

that Fe from nFe3O4-PEG can penetrate within this tissue, whereas XAS and SEM-EDX 

confirmed the presence of magnetite inside the hilum. XAS also unraveled that most of the Cu 

incorporated by the seeds soaked in nCuO dispersions remained in its pristine form, except 

for the 40 nm nCuO treatment that presented in the embryo of the seeds Cu slightly reduced 

compared to that found in the seed coat, an evidence that nanoparticles can be biotransformed 

after seed soaking. 

Much attention must be paid to the core shell effects. Differently from the others, the 

25 nm nCuO consisted of a metallic core made of Cu covered by oxidized layers of Cu2O and 

CuO, which made this treatment the most harmful to the seedling development and also the 

most chemically reactive. The final disposal of that kind of nanoparticle is an environmental 

issue to be addressed.

On the other hand, the surface chemistry modification by hydrophilic materials like 

PEG can be a promise way to boost seedling development. The highest radicle elongation 

caused by nFe3O4-PEG might be the outcome of a higher water uptake by the seedlings 

tissues induced by the PEG. This coating material provided magnetite nanoparticles less 

reactive and less toxic to the seedlings. 

Therefore, depending on its physical-chemical properties, the use of CuO and 

magnetite nanoparticles on seed priming can be a promise way to enhance P. vulgaris 

development since, in general, toxicity caused by nanoparticles was less prone to occur than 

by conventional soluble sources (CuSO4 and Fe3+/Fe2+).  

Further investigations are necessary once the results here presented concern only for 

the early growth stages of the plant and the effects for the advanced ones still unknown. 

Besides that, these responses may vary according to the crops and genotypes.
