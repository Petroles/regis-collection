Preamble 
 

This thesis is the result of work done by Sambingo da Silva Cardoso during his doctoral studies 

in Meteorology at the University of Lisbon (UL, Portugal). The investigation, performed in the 

framework of the GPCI (Global energy and water cycle experiment cloud system study / 

working group on numerical experimentation Pacific Cross-section Intercomparison) project, 

was carried out both in Portugal and in the United States of America (U.S.A.), respectively, at 

the Center of Geophysics of the University of Lisbon (CGUL), and at the National Center for 

Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The work was supervised by Professor Pedro Miranda (UL), 

and by Doctor Phil Rasch (NCAR, now at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory [PNNL, 

U.S.A.]), later substituted by Doctor Andrew Gettelman (NCAR). Short-term visits to the Joint 

Institute for Regional Earth System Science and Engineering (JIFRESSE, University of 

California, U.S.A.), and to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, U.S.A.) were hosted by Doctor 

João Teixeira (JPL), GPCI project coordinator. GPCI was funded by the National Aeronautics 

and Space Administration (NASA, U.S.A.) grant X06AB74G. CGUL is funded by the 

Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation (FCT, Portugal). NCAR is supported by the 

National Science Foundation (NSF, U.S.A.). The work presented here was supported from 

February 2008 to February 2012 by a Doctoral Grant from FCT (SFRH/BD/37214/2007).

number of people to whom I am grateful. There is not enough space here to list all of them and 

the ways they have helped me. From the administrative personnel at the various institutions I 

visited (most notably, Christina Book, at NCAR in Boulder [U.S.A.], a friend for life!), to the 

graduate and undergraduate students I met at some of those research centers, not forgetting the 

roommates and landladies I had during my stays abroad (especially, 91 years young Louise 

Adams, a dear friend!), or even the, always amicable, NCAR shuttle drivers, I truly believe that 

every single person I met during this, not always easy, journey deserves my profound

Abstract 
 

The GPCI (GCSS / working group on numerical experimentation Pacific Cross-section 

Intercomparison) project offers a new approach for the intercomparison of models, by focusing 

the analysis on a single cross section in the NE Pacific ocean. It is targeted at the 

stratocumulus, shallow cumulus, and deep convection regimes, as well as the respective 

transitions. Three-hourly satellite observations and model simulations were prepared for GPCI 

for the JJA season. The seasonal mean results for variables such as total cloud cover, liquid 

water path, and outgoing longwave radiation show high scatter among models. Mean vertical 

velocity, and relative humidity, suggest good, overall, representation of the Hadley circulation. 

Still, differences exist between models (e.g., in the intensity of the deep convection, or 

humidity content in the boundary layer). The main cloud types are represented differently (e.g., 

too low stratocumulus clouds). The transitions between stratocumulus and shallow cumulus 

show two distinct behaviours (smooth versus abrupt with bimodal nature) reflecting distinct 

cloud parameterization approaches. None of them reproduces well the observations. Following 

GEPAT (Grade-based Empirical Pattern Analysis Technique), different cloud patterns were 

analyzed in terms of the means of associated parameters. Model relative humidity has negative 

biases in the boundary layer and subtropical mid troposphere. sBLT (sequential Boundary-

Layer-Top determination scheme) offered a more thorough characterization of the boundary 

layer (top). Mean BLT height and strength show big spread among models. Models disagree in 

the time of the diurnal maxima of relative humidity, cloud fraction, and liquid water content. 

Precipitation lacks in diurnal amplitude in the deep convection area. The “Scinertia” concept 

was introduced, based on the analysis of diurnal cycle results for cloud cover and low 

tropospheric stability. GPCI proved useful for the work presented below, both in the 

characterization of model shortcomings, and in helping envision avenues for future 

investigation using models and observations.

Resumo 
 

Apesar dos consideráveis avanços dos últimos 20 anos ao nível da parametrização de nuvens, a 

representação de nuvens ainda é um desfio para as comunidades de modelação do tempo e do 

clima. A urgência do desenvolvimento de parametrizações de nuvens para modelos de 

circulação geral (GCM) é reforçada pelo facto de a quantidade de nuvens gerada pelos modelos 

ter um impacto significativo no comportamento do sistema climático previsto pelos modelos. 

Em particular, os atuais modelos de clima tendem a responder de forma diferente em 

experiências de sensibilidade das mudanças climáticas. Deficiências nas parametrizações 

resultam igualmente numa representação inconsistente do ciclo hidrológico ao nível 

termodinâmico, o que acarreta importantes consequências para a simulação da circulação 

atmosférica tropical e subtropical. Estes tópicos são investigados por diferentes grupos do 

GCSS (Global energy and water cycle experiment Cloud System Study), cuja estratégia tem 

sido bem sucedida na definição e compreensão de regimes de nuvens fundamentais, e no 

desenvolvimento e melhoramento de parametrizações de nuvens. No entanto, o uso exclusivo 

de versões unidimensionais dos modelos atmosféricos, tradicionalmente feito no GCSS, não 

permite uma compreensão profunda do papel fundamental das nuvens no clima, o que implica 

que as parametrizações têm de ser testadas nas versões completas (tridimensionais) dos GCMs. 

Essa é uma tarefa que pode ter que envolver a análise de enormes quantidades de dados de 

simulações numéricas. 

Neste contexto, o projeto GPCI (GCSS / working group on numerical experimentation Pacific 

Cross-section Intercomparison) oferece uma nova (e menos pesada) abordagem para a 

intercomparação de GCMs, focando a análise num número reduzido de localizações ao longo 

de uma secção, e permitindo uma integração de dados de modelos e de observações 

relativamente simples. GPCI tem estado centrado nos (sub)trópicos do sector NE do oceano 

Pacífico, e desenvolveu um programa especificamente dedicado à investigação de regimes de 

nuvens fundamentais que tipicamente ocorrem nas fronteiras orientais dos oceanos 

(sub)tropicais, nomeadamente, estratocúmulos, cúmulos pouco profundos, torres de convecção 

profunda, e as transições entre eles. O conhecimento ganho a partir de uma análise detalhada 

do comportamento destes sistemas de nuvens e dos ambientes dinâmicos e termodinâmicos a 

eles associados, recorrendo a dados de alta resolução temporal obtidos de observações e de 

modelos de previsão do tempo e do clima, deverá oferecer pistas para o desenvolvimento e 

melhoramento de novas parametrizações de nuvens, camada limite e convecção. Tendo sido 

|  v  | 



 

desenvolvida em estreita ligação com o projeto GPCI, a investigação apresentada nesta tese foi 

orientada segundo as linhas dos principais objetivos e questões científicas do projeto. 

GPCI pode ser visto como um projeto de intercomparação de nível 2, em que todos os modelos 

participantes têm de seguir um conjunto comum de especificações e protocolos predefinidos. A 

condição básica imposta foi a de que os modelos deveriam correr em modo de clima, usando 

temperatura da superfície do mar (SST) prescrita como condição fronteira. O período de 

interesse corresponde a junho-julho-agosto (JJA). A região geográfica a estudar esta 

compreendida entre -5ºN a 45ºN e 160ºE a 240ºE, e inclui 13 localizações ao longo de uma 

secção. Os resultados das simulações numéricas foram pedidos numa resolução temporal de 3 

horas para variáveis na forma de perfis verticais e para variáveis a um nível fixo. Mais de vinte 

instituições de previsão do tempo e do clima aderiram ao projeto e extensas quantidades de 

dados de satélite foram preparados para uso no GPCI. A análise de dados de modelos e de 

reanálises sugere que é possível estudar os principais aspetos da fenomenologia das nuvens, 

recorrendo apenas a uma secção individual alinhada com a circulação atmosférica associada à 

circulação da célula de Hadley na região em causa. 

Uma análise preliminar de dados de modelos e de observações, com o objetivo de se obter uma 

visão geral das caraterísticas médias do ciclo hidrológico durante o verão na região GPCI, foi 

feita com particular enfase na distribuição vertical das nuvens, e nos processos que envolvem 

fatores dinâmicos e ambientais que têm um papel na manutenção dos campos de nuvens. As 

médias sazonais da maior parte das variáveis (e.g., cobertura nebulosa total [TCC], conteúdo 

de água líquida integrado na vertical [LWP], e radiação emergente de longo comprimento de 

onda [OLR]) são caracterizadas por um elevado grau de dispersão entre os vários modelos, que 

raramente mostram uma boa concordância com as observações em todos os pontos da secção. 

Perfis médios de velocidade vertical (w) e de humidade relativa (RH), sugerem que as 

características básicas da circulação atmosférica regional imposta pela célula de Hadley são, de 

um modo geral, bem representadas, apesar de, em detalhe, existirem diferenças substanciais 

entre os vários modelos (e.g., na intensidade da convecção profunda, ou no conteúdo em 

humidade na camada limite). Uma comparação da distribuição vertical de cobertura nebulosa 

(CF) nos vários modelos, mostrou bem os desafios da parametrização e simulação de nuvens 

em GCMs, com as simulações a mostrarem uma variedade de comportamentos ao nível da 

representação dos diferentes tipos de nuvens (e.g., estratocúmulos demasiado baixos) e das 

transições entre eles (e.g., presença de mais do que uma camada de nuvens nas áreas de 

transição). Estes resultados foram validados com observações da ocorrência de nuvens obtidas 

|  vi  | 



 

com os satélites CloudSat e CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite 

Observations). Um estudo ao nível dos processos físicos relevantes para as nuvens, revelou 

que, de um modo geral, existe uma resposta notória da circulação de larga escala a mudanças 

na SST prescrita nos modelos. As respostas de outras variáveis, tais como, balanço da radiação 

de pequeno comprimento de onda no topo da atmosfera (NSRTOA) e TCC, são ainda mais 

pronunciadas e variam de modelo para modelo. O facto de, na maior parte dos modelos, a 

resposta ao aumento da SST nem sempre ser coerente entre as diferentes variáveis, aponta para 

a necessidade de um melhor controlo do comportamento da simulação de importantes 

parâmetros relacionados com as nuvens, incluindo aqueles cruciais para a avaliação do 

forçamento radiativo das nuvens. Não foi encontrada (nos dados de 3-em-3 horas das 

simulações para JJA 1998) nenhuma relação óbvia entre as nuvens baixas (dos regimes de 

cúmulos pouco profundos e de estratocúmulos) a subsidência e a SST (ou mesmo a 

estabilidade estática da baixa troposfera [LTS]). 

Foi feita uma análise de fundo da transição entre regimes convectivos, baseada no 

comportamento espaciotemporal das nuvens em simulações dos modelos, em reanálises e em 

observações de satélite. Com esse objetivo em mente, foram desenvolvidas várias técnicas para 

detetar transições de regime de nuvens, e ou, caracterizar a sua estrutura sazonal. Funções de 

distribuição de probabilidade, obtidas para TCC nas várias posições ao longo da secção GPCI, 

a partir de dados de 3-em-3 horas para a estação JJA 1998, mostram diferenças de modelo para 

modelo e apresentam importantes disparidades mesmo em posições onde os modelos mostram 

praticamente o mesmo valor na TCC média. Dois comportamentos distintos foram 

identificados ao nível da transição entre os estratocúmulos e os cúmulos dos ventos alísios: 

uma transição relativamente gradual da TCC; e uma variação mais abrupta, com carácter 

bimodal. Estes dois tipos de comportamentos são, provavelmente, um resultado da maneira 

como as nuvens são parametrizadas nos respetivos modelos. De qualquer maneira, nenhum 

destes comportamentos coincide com a forma como as transições se dão em dados 

correspondentes a observações da TCC do ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology 

Project). Estatísticas da cobertura nebulosa obtidas segundo uma metodologia desenvolvida 

para a deteção de fortes gradientes de TCC ao longo da secção, mostram uma diversidade de 

comportamentos entre os modelos, por exemplo, no valor médio do decréscimo de TCC, na 

sua frequência de ocorrência, ou nos histogramas da localização dessas transições em TCC (as 

reanálises também diferem do ISCCP). Adicionalmente, foi também efetuada uma análise 

espectral preliminar da série temporal correspondente a variações da localização das transições

abruptas em TCC ao longo da secção. Não tendo sido detetados picos importantes nos 

respetivos espectros, foi na forma da evolução temporal nas correspondentes séries, que os 

modelos mais se distinguiram (e.g., uma tendência, num dos modelos, para as transições 

ocorrerem mais para norte na secção no período final da estação JJA; ou a relativamente 

pequena amplitude das oscilações de localização encontradas num outro modelo). Em termos 

da evolução espacial da altura do topo das nuvens vista ao longo da secção, a média dos 

modelos está próxima dos dados de análise, apesar de, especialmente a sul das áreas de 

estratocúmulos, todos os resultados diferirem de observações MISR (Multiangle Imaging 

Spectroradiometer). Ainda no contexto da transição de regime de nuvens, foi desenvolvida 

uma nova abordagem de análise de padrões espaciais (GEPAT [Grade-based Empirical Pattern 

Analysis Technique]) com objetivo de se analisarem as condições ambientais associadas a 

diferentes estruturas espaciais da TCC identificadas pela nova técnica durante a estação JJA 

1998. Foram assim encontrados seis diferentes padrões espaciais de cobertura nebulosa típicos 

da estação (cada um com diferente representatividade de ocorrência temporal). As 

correspondentes médias em termos de outras variáveis, tais como w aos 700 hPa, LWP, SST, 

LTS, e direção e intensidade do vento, foram analisadas, tendo sido encontradas diferenças, 

especialmente ao nível dos campos de w aos 700 hPa e LWP. Algumas ideias da aplicação 

futura da técnica incluem: a análise de outras estações e anos (separada ou conjuntamente); 

uma comparação de resultados para diferentes regiões; e o uso de dados puramente 

observacionais. 

Foi dada especial atenção à estrutura da humidade na região GPCI, com o objetivo de uma 

maior compreensão do seu papel como um dos principais parâmetros no contexto do ciclo 

hidrológico, particularmente através da sua influência na formação e evolução das nuvens. Para 

esse fim, foram analisadas ao longo da secção, observações de satélite (AIRS [Atmospheric 

InfraRed Sounder]), simulações numéricas e análises da atmosfera, referentes a perfis de RH, 

obtidos para JJA (2003) na forma de médias sazonais, variância e evolução temporal. A 

comparação dos modelos com os dados AIRS mostrou diferenças significativas (e.g., valores 

bastante inferiores de RH nos níveis mais baixos da camada limite nas simulações, valores 

mais elevados do que as observações na tropopausa, e maior secura aos níveis médios da 

atmosfera nas regiões subtropicais nos modelos). No que diz respeito ao desvio padrão, ainda 

que, de um modo geral, os modelos apresentem maior variabilidade de RH, existem nas 

simulações, valores mais baixos na camada limite ao longo de toda a secção. Pensa-se que os 

valores mais elevados de desvio padrão apresentados pelos modelos imediatamente acima da 

|  viii  | 



 

camada limite a norte da região dos cúmulos pouco profundos devam estar associados 

primariamente à relativamente fraca resolução vertical dos dados AIRS usados (mais do que 

serem uma consequência de deficiências nos modelos). A evolução temporal da distribuição 

vertical de RH parece apontar para a necessidade de se incluir na investigação das transições 

entre os estratocúmulos e os cúmulos dos ventos alísios, a influência, não apenas da estrutura 

da humidade nas camadas da troposfera logo acima da camada limite, mas também do perfil de 

humidade até às camadas superiores da troposfera. Mais especificamente em relação à 

estrutura da humidade na baixa troposfera, foi apresentada uma nova metodologia para a 

determinação do topo da camada limite sobre o oceano (sBLT [sequential Boundary-Layer-

Top determination scheme]). Os resultados preliminares parecem promissores, especialmente 

pela sua abrangente aplicabilidade, e dado que a técnica permite uma maior caracterização da 

camada limite (e do seu topo) que outros métodos relacionados. Médias sazonais para a altura e 

a intensidade do topo da camada limite foram analisadas para modelos e análises ao longo da 

secção GPCI, e mostram dispersão considerável, exceto em termos da (praticamente comum) 

taxa de subida do topo da camada limite de norte para sul entre a área dos estratocúmulos e a 

dos cúmulos pouco profundos. As áreas de convecção profunda e dos estratocúmulos 

apresentam, respetivamente, o maior e o menor grau de definição (intensidade) do topo da 

camada limite. Segundo a classificação sBLT, foram encontradas nos modelos, e para as várias 

localizações na secção, diferenças na distribuição sazonal da representatividade dos vários 

tipos de camada limite. A esse respeito, apenas dois dos modelos se assemelham às 

observações AIRS. Foi ainda desenvolvida uma versão atualizada da técnica para deteção de 

mudanças abruptas na cobertura nebulosa ao longo da secção. A nova metodologia pareceu 

apresentar maior robustez no constrangimento dos resultados dos modelos para aquelas 

situações que efetivamente correspondem a transições espacialmente consistentes com a 

definição dos regimes de nuvens característicos dos estratocúmulos e dos cúmulos dos ventos 

alísios. Os valores da ocorrência das transições baixou drasticamente na maior parte dos 

modelos, e permitiu, uma melhor identificação dos impactos que diferentes filosofias de 

parametrização de nuvens têm no comportamento dos modelos a este nível. Por último, foram 

obtidos os perfis médios de RH correspondentes a cada um dos dois regimes de nuvens 

identificados, tendo sido verificadas importantes diferenças entre os dois regimes, para um 

determinado modelo, mas também entre os modelos, principalmente na forma como diferem os 

seus perfis de estratocúmulos e de cúmulos pouco profundos na média e alta troposfera. Foram 

propostas formas concretas de se estender a investigação dos potenciais impactos da estrutura 

da humidade da troposfera na transição entre os regimes de nuvens.

Um dos principais tópicos para o projeto GPCI é a representação, em modelos de previsão do 

tempo e do clima, de variações diurnas das nuvens e de parâmetros relacionados. Essas 

variações foram analisadas com base em dados de 3-em-3 horas obtidos dos modelos e de 

observações. O ciclo diurno médio na estação JJA foi descrito para diferentes localizações na 

secção GPCI. Foram apresentados resultados para: circulação atmosférica associada com a 

dinâmica de larga escala na região do Pacífico NE dominada pela célula de Hadley; perfis 

verticais de vários parâmetros de interesse para as nuvens; e anomalias médias do ciclo diurno 

em três posições da secção, representativas dos principais regimes de nuvens/convecção que 

caracterizam a região. A velocidade vertical aos 700 hPa apresenta, em geral, nos modelos e 

análises, um ciclo diurno marcado na zona de convergência inter-tropical (ITCZ). Nalguns 

modelos variações diurnas mais fracas foram também encontradas na região dos ventos alísios 

e nas regiões subtropicais. Num dos modelos o ciclo diurno de w aos 700 hPa é praticamente 

inexistente em qualquer das posições ao longo da secção. A intensidade e direção do vento na 

baixa troposfera mostrou variações diurnas características. A distribuição vertical de RH, CF, e 

conteúdo em água líquida das nuvens (CLW), mostrou alguma variabilidade diurna em todos 

os modelos analisados, especialmente abaixo dos 600 hPa na área de convecção profunda. Os 

modelos não concordam na altura do ciclo diurno em que simulam os valores máximos destas 

variáveis. Verificou-se, em geral, uma melhor concordância entre a variação diurna de CF e 

CLW nos estratocúmulos e nos cúmulos pouco profundos do que na ITCZ. Há, na região 

subtropical num dos modelos, CF simulada sem CLW associada. Em relação às anomalias 

médias diurnas de LTS, TCC, e precipitação (observações deste parâmetro foram obtidas de 

dados TRMM [Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission]), os modelos tendem a concordar no 

primeiro parâmetro, mas diferem uns dos outros, e em relação às observações, nos outros 

dois.(e.g., na ITCZ, a TCC do ISCCP apresenta dois máximos relativos, sendo o mais 

pronunciado o que ocorre cerca das 16:00h locais, enquanto que nos modelos e análises, o pico 

de TCC mais importante dá-se tipicamente de madrugada). Nos estratocúmulos o ISCCP 

(TCC) tem a menor variação diurna, sendo a esse respeito, ultrapassado pelos modelos. De 

qualquer maneira, é nessa região que se verifica uma maior concordância entre modelos, 

análises e observações na altura do ciclo diurno em que se dá o máximo de TCC. No que diz 

respeito à taxa de precipitação, a maior parte dos resultados mostra um pico relativamente bem 

definido em todas as localizações ao longo da secção, mas apresentam, para os modelos, uma 

fraca amplitude diurna na ITCZ comparativamente aos dados TRMM. Finalmente, foi 

investigada a ligação, durante o ciclo diurno, entre a LTS e a cobertura nebulosa nos 

estratocúmulos para o caso particular de um modelo com um esquema de parametrização que 

|  x  | 



 

associa os dois, tendo-se argumentado sobre a existência de um certo grau de “inércia” na 

resposta da cobertura nebulosa subtropical em relação às variações diurnas de LTS. Do mesmo 

modo, e uma vez que a resposta (positiva) das nuvens à estabilidade estática do ambiente 

pareceu ser mais eficaz para a altura do ciclo diurno em que o valor de TCC era o mais baixo, 

inferiu-se qualitativamente sobre uma possível dependência dessa resposta no valor 

apresentado pela cobertura nebulosa. Até que ponto estará a “Scinércia” (ou “inércia dos 

estratocúmulos [Sc]” em relação à LTS) relacionada com a estrutura da humidade da (média) 

troposfera, foi uma questão deixada para investigação futura. 

Dois pontos, para concluir. Primeiro, este trabalho mostra bem como os atuais modelos de 

previsão numérica do tempo e do clima ainda apresentam uma deficiente representação das 

nuvens e de processos relacionados. Segundo, a abordagem proposta pelo projeto GPCI provou 

ser útil na caracterização dos principais problemas dos modelos, e na definição de possíveis 

linhas de investigação futura, quer ao nível da modelação, quer na frente observacional.

1 Introduction 

1.1 Motivation and main goals 

Notwithstanding the considerable improvement in cloud and cloudy boundary layer 

parameterization in the last 20 years (e.g., Tiedtke 1993; Del Genio et al. 1996; Fowler et al. 

1996; Rasch and Kristjánsson 1998; Lock et al. 2000; Lock 2001; Bony and Emanuel 2001; 

Teixeira and Hogan 2002; Tompkins 2002), the representation of clouds is still a challenge for 

the weather and climate modelling communities (e.g., Teixeira 1999; Jakob 1999; Duynkerke 

and Teixeira 2001; Siebesma et al. 2004), thus underlining the continued need for 

observational methods and campaigns targeted at different cloud systems, along with the 

development of cloud parameterization in GCMs (General Circulation Models). This urgency 

is reinforced by the fact that the amount of cloud generated by the models has a significant 

impact on the predicted behaviour of the climate system (e.g., Cess et al. 1989; Slingo 1990). 

In particular, current climate models tend to respond differently in climate change sensitivity 

experiments, often showing diverging cloud-climate feedbacks, a situation explained, to a great 

extent, by significant differences in low (boundary layer) cloudiness (e.g., Bony et al. 2004; 

Bony and Dufresne 2005; Bony et al. 2006; Wyant et al. 2006; Stephens 2005). 

Parameterization deficiencies also result in thermodynamically inconsistent representation of 

the hydrologic cycle, which has important implications in the simulation of the (sub)tropical 

atmospheric circulation and its interplay with boundary layer and deep convection clouds (e.g., 

Philander et al. 1996; Ma et al. 1996; Larson et al. 1999). 

These topics are investigated by different GCSS (Global energy and water cycle experiment 

Cloud System Study) working groups (boundary layer clouds, cirrus, frontal clouds, deep 

convection, and polar clouds), which have been successful in defining and understanding 

fundamental cloud regimes (e.g., Duynkerke et al. 1999; Bretherton et al. 1999; Bechtold et al. 

2000; Redelsperger et al. 2000; Stevens et al. 2001; Randall et al. 2003; Siebesma et al. 2003), 

and in the development of new cloud and cloudy boundary layer parameterizations (e.g., 

Cuijpers and Bechtold 1995; Lock et al. 2000; Golaz et al. 2002; Teixeira and Hogan 2002; 

Cheinet and Teixeira 2003; Lenderink and Holtslag 2004; Bretherton et al. 2004b; Soares et al. 

2004; Bretherton and Park 2009). Traditionally, four main steps characterize the GCSS 

strategy: i) creation of an observationally-based case study; ii) evaluation of CRM (Cloud-

- 1 - 



-    Introduction    - 

Resolving Model) and LES (Large-Eddy Simulation) models for the case study; iii) evaluation 

of parameterizations using SCMs (Single-Column Models); and iv) develop and improve 

parameterizations using the statistics from the CRM and LES models. 

However, the exclusive use of one-dimensional (SCM) versions of the atmospheric models 

does not allow a deep understanding of the fundamental role of clouds in climate (e.g., cloud-

climate feedbacks) owing to the fact that the large scale dynamics is prescribed in the SCM and 

CRM models. This implies that parameterization testing has to be done in the complete (3D 

[three-Dimensional]) versions of weather and climate prediction models, which potentially 

entails the analysis of very large amounts of model simulation data. In this context, the GPCI 

(Global energy and water cycle experiment cloud system study / working group on numerical 

experimentation Pacific Cross-section Intercomparison) project offers a new and much lighter 

approach for the intercomparison of GCMs, by focusing the analysis on a reduced number of 

locations along a cross section in a carefully chosen geographical region, allowing for a 

relatively straightforward model and observational data integration. More precisely, the GPCI 

approach has, this far, been focused on the (sub)tropical NE Pacific ocean, although, in 

general, suitable for other similar regions (e.g., in the SE Pacific). 

Cloud parameterization development and improvement resorting to high temporal resolution 

model output to allow the evaluation of the representation of the diurnal cycle, and the 

exploration and validation of state-of-the-art observational datasets to understand different 

cloud regimes and the transitions between them, are at the core of GPCI’s motivations. In the 

long run this approach could also contribute to a better understanding of how the global 

changes in precipitation, evaporation, and hydrologic cycle are taking place. 

Having been developed in tight connection with the GPCI project, the investigation presented 

in this thesis was oriented along the lines of GPCI’s main goals and scientific questions 

(Section 3.1.2). 

1.2 Outline 

This thesis is divided into 8 main chapters. 

The introductory chapter is followed by an overview of cloud climatology, cloud-related 

processes, and dedicated observational campaigns, given separately in a global, and in a 

regional perspective, with a special focus on (sub)tropical maritime low boundary-layer clouds. 

Also in Chapter 2, a brief description is given of the main physical processes thought to impact 

- 2 - 



-    Introduction    - 

the formation of low stratiform cloudiness over the subtropical oceans. The last section is 

dedicated to cloud parameterization, and presents a general view on some of the main aspects 

of the representation of clouds in numerical models. 

Chapter 3 is dedicated to the GPCI project, and starts with some background, followed by the 

project’s main goals. The project protocol is detailed, and information is presented on the 

participating models, and observational datasets used in this work. The chapter closes with a 

discussion on the representativeness of the GPCI cross section and concludes on the robustness 

of the GPCI approach. 

The fourth chapter, is focused on a preliminary analysis of GPCI model and observational data, 

and discusses the corresponding results with the goal to give an overview of the mean 

characteristics of the summertime atmospheric hydrologic cycle in the (sub)tropical NE 

Pacific. Emphasis is also given to the vertical distribution of clouds, and to processes involving 

dynamical and environmental factors that play a role in the maintenance of total and low cloud 

fields on a seasonal time scale. 

An in-depth analysis of convective regime transition, based on the spatiotemporal behaviour of 

clouds is attempted in Chapter 5, resorting to cloud data from model simulations, atmospheric 

reanalysis, and satellite observations. To gain insight into the question of the transition in 

(sub)tropical cloud regimes, several techniques are developed to detect the transitions, and or 

summarize their main seasonal features. Additionally, a preliminary spectral analysis of the 

seasonal record of spatial shifts in the location of sharp gradients in cloud cover is performed, 

and a novel approach to clustering of spatial patterns is introduced, and subsequently applied to 

total cloud cover along the GPCI transect, with the final goal to indentify main spatiotemporal 

features of the seasonal cloud cover, and compare associated environmental conditions. 

Chapter 6 is dedicated to the study of the humidity structure in the GPCI region, with the goal 

to better understand its role as one of the main parameters in the context of the hydrologic 

cycle, particularly through its influence on cloud formation and evolution. State-of-the-art 

satellite observations are analyzed along the cross section, together with model simulations and 

atmospheric analyses. A number of results, based on the treatment of relative humidity data for 

the summer season, are presented, namely, seasonal mean profiles, variance, temporal 

evolution, boundary-layer properties, and potential impact on cloudiness structure and 

transition. The chapter introduces a new methodology for the determination of the top of the 

maritime boundary layer, and updates the technique for the detection of abrupt changes in the 

spatial distribution of clouds initially presented in Chapter 5.

-    Introduction    - 

As one of the main topics in GPCI, the representation, in weather and climate prediction 

models, of the diurnal variation of clouds and cloud-related parameters, is the focus in Chapter 

7. Three-hourly model output and observational data are used to characterize the diurnal cycle, 

as seen in seasonal means at different locations along the GPCI transect. Results are presented 

for: atmospheric circulation associated with the large-scale dynamics in the Hadley-cell-

dominated NE Pacific; a number of cloud-related vertically-distributed variables; and for June-

July-August mean diurnal cycle anomalies at three specific locations in the cross section, 

representative of the main cloud/convection regimes found in the region. 

The main conclusions of this work are presented in Chapter 8, followed by a list of the 

bibliography referenced. 

A note on the contents of the CD-ROM with the appendixes to this work forms the Appendix, 

placed at the end of the thesis.

2 Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans 

Clouds are known to be an important regulator of the climate system. They interact with the 

atmosphere in many ways, and influence its dynamic behaviour at different scales, from those 

at which they occur, to the global atmospheric circulation. Randall (1989) categorized the 

direct effects of clouds on the atmosphere in three “cloud forcing” mechanisms: radiative 

forcing, latent forcing, and convective forcing. The radiative forcing (Ramanathan 1987) 

describes the clouds’ modulation on the solar and terrestrial radiative fluxes; the latent forcing 

describes the effects of vaporization and condensation latent heat that occur in clouds and 

precipitation; the convective forcing describes additional effects of heat, moisture, and 

momentum transport in convective clouds, associated with latent heat release, but treated 

separately from it. Through the combination of these three forcings, clouds profoundly 

influence the distribution of energy in the atmosphere, and the hydrologic cycle, and, therefore, 

the large-scale atmospheric circulation. Despite all the current knowledge, clouds are still one 

of the biggest challenges in climate research. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 

(IPCC) emphasized that one of the sources of uncertainty in global climate prediction is the 

incomplete knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the formation, dissipation, and radiative 

properties of clouds (Houghton et al. 1990; Houghton et al. 1992; Solomon et al. 2007). 

The next two sections of this chapter present an overview of cloud climatology, cloud-related 

processes, and dedicated observational campaigns, in global (Section 2.1), and in regional 

(Section 2.2) perspectives, with a special focus on (sub)tropical maritime low boundary-layer 

clouds. In Section 2.3, the main physical processes thought to impact the formation of low 

stratiform cloudiness over the subtropical oceans are briefly described. Section 2.4 (Cloud 

parameterization) gives a general view on some of the main aspects of the representation of 

clouds in numerical models. 

2.1 Global scale 

The maritime atmospheric boundary layer (MBL) differs in many aspects from the atmospheric 

boundary layer (BL) over the continents. A few characteristics of the MBL, as compared to the 

continental BL, are typically highlighted, namely: a) the air close to the surface is moister, with 

relative humidity in the range of 75 % to 100 %; b) the diurnal cycle tends to be weaker 

- 5 - 



-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - 

(though not negligible); c) except close to the coast, the difference in temperature between the 

air and the surface tends to be small (as a result of radiative cooling the air is usually up to 2 K 

cooler than the surface water, with significant temperature differences resulting in vigorous 

convection able to balance the effects of horizontal thermal advection [except in regions with 

strong sea surface temperature contrast], which makes for a neutral surface layer over most 

oceanic regions); d) more than 95 % of the global MBL has clouds, the exceptions being the 

coastal areas where warm and dry continental air is advected over a colder ocean, and some 

regions (e.g., in the western boundaries of the subtropical oceans) where air is advected from 

areas with relatively high sea surface temperature (SST) to areas with lower SSTs. 

Boundary-layer clouds, or, in general, low clouds, occur frequently in the atmosphere, and are 

notably abundant in the MBL. The fact that they cover large areas of the globe make them 

particularly important for the radiative balance of the planet. A crucial climate topic is thus the 

understanding of the factors that control their abundance (e.g., Randall et al. 1984; Klein and 

Hartmann 1993; Bony et al. 2004; Sandu et al. 2010; Teixeira et al. 2011). 

Shallow cumulus (ShCu), stratus, stratocumulus (Sc), and nimbostratus are the most frequent 

cloud types in the BL. Recent investigation suggests that the Sc and ShCu play an important 

role in the tropical and subtropical atmospheric circulation (e.g., Philander et al. 1996; 

Siebesma 1998; Larson et al. 1999). These two types of clouds are described in the next 

paragraphs. 

Stratocumulus occurrence is particularly frequent over the oceanic regions and is generally 

associated with subsidence conditions in the subtropical regions and mid-latitudes. This is 

particularly notorious in subtropical regions in the eastern boundaries of the great oceans, 

where the descending branch of the Hadley cell circulation forces the subsidence of air over 

relatively cold surface waters, e.g., the regions to the west of California (NE Pacific), Peru (SE 

Pacific), Namibia (SE Atlantic), and Mauritania (NE Atlantic) (Hanson 1991; Klein and 

Hartmann 1993; Ma et al. 1996). Also noteworthy is the formation of Sc that occur during the 

Winter over the warm current regions of the western boundary of the big ocean basins (e.g., 

Kuroshio current [NW Pacific] and Gulf current [NW Atlantic]). In these regions, the contact 

of cold continental air masses with a relatively warm ocean surface results in strong heat and 

humidity fluxes that increase the depth of the MBL and favor convection, in contrast to what 

happens in the subtropical subsidence regions where convection is maintained by strong cloud-

top radiative cooling (e.g., Klein and Hartmann 1993; Bretherton et al. 2004a). A third type of 

low stratiform clouds, Arctic stratus, forms essentially during the Summer, and, in many cases, 

- 6 - 



-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - 

results from the radiative cooling of moist air reaching the Arctic from subpolar latitudes (e.g., 

Herman and Goody 1976; Curry et al. 1988). A unique characteristic of these stratus is the 

tendency to form multiple cloud layers, and the occurrence of humidity inversions with an 

increase of moisture from the base to the top of the inversion layer. Other types of stratus 

include those that occur during the Summer in the SE China plateau, and the maritime Summer 

stratus of the mid-latitudes between 45°N and 60°N. 

Several observational campaigns and initiatives have been focused on improving the 

understanding of the Sc thermodynamic and turbulent structure, and chemistry, among them: 

FIRE (First International satellite cloud climatology project Regional Experiment [Albrecht et 

al. 1988]); ASTEX (Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition EXperiment [Albrecht et al. 1995]); and 

DYCOMS-II (the second Dynamics and Chemistry of Marine Stratocumulus field study 

[Stevens et al. 2003]). These have provided important data for a number of subsequent studies 

on Sc (e.g., Duynkerke and Driedonks 1987; Hignett 1991; Duynkerke and Teixeira 2001). 

More recently the use of  Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) models has increased our 

understanding of fundamental mechanisms responsible for the formation and maintenance of 

Sc (e.g. Moeng et al. 1996; Stevens et al. 1998; Duynkerke et al., 1999). Climate research has 

reinforced the idea that Sc are important agents of its variability and dynamics (e.g., Philander 

et al. 1996; Clement and Seager 1999; Bony and Dufresne 2005). 

Another type of low cloud with an important presence in the BL, and typically associated with 

convective boundary layer (CBL) situations is the ShCu. Its distribution affects on average, 

respectively,  12 %, and 5 %, of the area over the oceans, and continents (Duynkerke 1998). 

One peculiar aspect of ShCu is the fact that they typically occur in oceanic regions where the 

trade winds prevail, in which case they are commonly known as the trade-wind cumulus. These 

clouds often make the transition between Sc-dominated regions and the ITCZ (Inter Tropical 

Convergence Zone) associated with the ascending branch of the Hadley cell. In the continental 

mid-latitudes ShCu are frequent during the Summer, and can evolve into cumulonimbus when 

conditions are favorable for deep convection. By intensifying the vertical transport of heat, 

moisture, and momentum in the ITCZ, and contributing to the overall humidity and heat 

transport in the Hadley cell system, ShCu exert a direct influence on the global atmospheric 

circulation and hydrologic cycle (e.g., Tiedtke 1987; Siebesma 1998). ShCu also posses 

radiative properties that indirectly affect the radiative balance of the planet (e.g., Ackerman et 

al. 1981; Marshak et al. 1995). 

- 7 - 



-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - 

Among the observational campaigns and initiatives dedicated to ShCu are: BOMEX (Barbados 

Oceanographic and Meteorological EXperiment [Kuettner and Holland 1969]); SCMS (Small 

Cumulus Microphysics Study [French et al. 1999]); ARM (Atmospheric Radiation 

Measurement [Brown et al. 2002]); and RICO (Rain In shallow Cumulus over the Ocean 

[Rauber et al. 2007]). Data from these campaigns were used in a number of research works 

(e.g., Warner 1977; Smith and Jonas 1995; De Roode and Duynkerke 1997). As with Sc, LES 

models are extensively used for the investigation of the CBL with ShCu (e.g., Sommeria 1976; 

Siebesma and Cuijpers 1995; Neggers et al. 2004). 

Figure 2.1 presents an annual climatology of the global distribution of low stratiform clouds 

(stratus, stratocumulus, and fog) obtained from surface observations. In the next section, the 

focus is on the regional characterization of the cloud systems that typically occur close to the 

eastern boundaries of the big oceans, including the kind of low boundary-layer clouds whose 

regional maxima can be seen in Fig. 2.1 off the coasts of California, Peru, and Namibia.

from surface observations (from Klein and Hartmann 1993). 

2.2 Regional scale 

The global distribution of low stratiform clouds patent in Fig. 2.1 clearly puts in evidence one 

of the most characteristic aspects of this type of clouds: the persistence of their occurrence to 

the east of the maritime subtropical anticyclones. Climatologically, these regions are marked 

by the presence of the (easterly) trade winds blowing (from the mid-latitudes) in the direction 

of the ITCZ. As mentioned in the previous section, stratus clouds form over the ocean in areas 

with relatively low SST, and below a strong temperature inversion at the top of the MBL. The 

inversion layer, also present in the trades, is maintained by the subsidence associated with the 

- 8 - 



-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - 

descending branch of the Hadley circulation and imposes a (vertical) limit to stratiform 

convection forcing the clouds to stay relatively low (there is some evidence of a possible 

relation between the intensity of the temperature inversion and the amount of stratus in the 

MBL). The inversion strength is linked to the intensity of the Hadley cell, which, in turn is, in 

part, determined by deep convection in the tropics (Klein and Hartmann 1993). As the trades 

approach the ITCZ, and higher SSTs, the inversion layer gradually deepens and the 

temperature inversion becomes less pronounced. This is usually accompanied by an increase in 

convection activity resulting in the formation of cumulus clouds that become dominant to the 

detriment of stratiform clouds. The mechanisms behind this transition are a current topic of 

investigation (e.g., Karlsson et al. 2010; Sandu et al. 2010; Teixeira et al. 2011). An illustration 

of the basic interplay between the boundary layer clouds, the SST and the large-scale 

atmospheric circulation in thermally direct circulations such as the Hadley (/Walker) cell, is 

given in Fig. 2.2, with deep precipitating cumulus towers found (in the ITCZ / western tropical 

oceans) over warm waters near the equator (EQ) as mediators of the ascending branch of the 

direct circulation(s); stratocumulus clouds covering the relatively cold (eastern) subtropical 

oceans under the influence of the subsiding branch of the large-scale, and land/sea circulations; 

and trade-wind cumulus in between, in concomitance with a deepening of the MBL (as 

mentioned in the previous section, ShCu play an important role in the transport of heat and 

humidity that contributes to fuel the Hadley circulation). 

 

Figure 2.2 - Illustration of the main cloud regimes associated with thermally direct circulations between the 
tropics, and the subtropics of the eastern boundaries of the main oceanic basins (EQ for equator) (from Stevens 

2005). 

In the specific case of the Pacific region close to California, the conditions for the occurrence 

of stratocumulus during the Summer season seem to include a well defined subtropical 

anticyclone, trade winds blowing equatorward with divergence indicative of strong subsidence, 

- 9 - 



-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - 

and a sharp temperature inversion at the top of a well mixed ~ 1000 m deep MBL (e.g., Klein 

and Hartmann 1993). A qualitative analysis of these aspects is given in the next paragraphs. 

Note firstly, that, an intense subtropical anticyclone is favorable to an increase of BL 

cloudiness, since, along with increased subsidence, steadiness of the wind field, and advection 

of relatively cooler air, it dries the troposphere, and limits the disrupting influence mid-latitude 

cyclones have on the BL processes. Moreover, it seems that atmospheric circulation changes 

force SST variations, probably through the effects on the energy balance of the ocean mixing 

layer, of the conjunction of stronger surface winds, more vigorous surface fluxes, and cloud 

cover (Klein et al. 1995). It should be kept in mind, however, that it is inadequate to think of 

low clouds as being solely related with SST; in that point of view it would be tempting to infer 

the existence of a global climatic feedback from the negative correlation between low clouds 

and SST that happens in certain circumstances. There is no clear indication of such a feedback 

(e.g., Hartmann and Michelsen 1993; Klein et al. 1995; Bony et al. 1997). 

Concerning, more specifically, the link between the strength of the inversion at the top of the 

MBL and stratiform cloud cover, the question is on its physical meaning. It is believed that the 

presence of the inversion layer forces the moisture that evaporates from the ocean surface to 

accumulate in the MBL and, eventually, reach saturation. Once a cloud is formed, convection 

is easily maintained, essentially owing to strong cloud-top radiative cooling (in the absence of 

clouds at higher levels, and, particularly, if the overlying free troposphere is relatively dry). 

Under these conditions the cloud will remain confined to the MBL because the inversion layer 

hinders its vertical (convective) development. It can then be concluded that an inversion layer 

is a necessary condition for the formation of (subtropical) MBL stratus. Still, it would be 

imprudent go much further and make a direct link between changes in inversion strength and 

changes in stratiform cloud cover. Another related aspect is the existence in the subtropical 

regions of a possible link between stratus and low tropospheric (static) stability (LTS, defined 

as the difference between the potential temperature at 700 hPa and at the surface). A positive 

feedback between both has even been suggested (Hanson 1991). In fact, this type of clouds 

help maintain the MBL relatively cool through longwave radiative cooling and scattering of 

shortwave energy from the Sun. This may cause an increase of the static stability, which can, 

in turn, be potentially responsible for a subsequent increase in stratus, and so on. The efficacy 

of such a feedback has to be evaluated taking into account that the MBL temperature is, to a 

great extent, determined by the SST. Knowing that the big heat capacity of the ocean implies 

that the SST is relatively unaffected by radiation changes (at least in shorter time scales), limits 

- 10 - 



-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - 

the effectiveness of the proposed feedback (Klein and Hartmann 1993). In any case, it should 

be stressed that the association between stratus and static stability does not necessarily imply a 

causal relation (in any direction). Nevertheless, some studies have shown a significant link 

between maritime low cloud cover and measures of atmospheric vertical stability in the MBL. 

Klein and Hartmann’s (1993) conclusions were drawn from the analysis of large areas of the 

maritime subtropics at the seasonal scale, showing a strong relation with LTS, while Wood and 

Bretherton (2006) showed improved connections using a variant of LTS, the estimated 

inversion strength (EIS). 

Observations suggest that, there is, in the NE Pacific and similar regions, a relation between 

the behaviour of the cloud cover at a given location and environmental conditions the 

corresponding air mass experienced upwind along the trajectory of the trades. An immediate 

conclusion is the need to adopt a Lagrangean perspective to follow the history of the MBL 

atmospheric flow and understand its implications for the cloudiness (e.g., Klein et al. 1995; 

Mauger and Norris 2010). In that case, the prediction of MBL cloud properties in GCMs 

(General Circulation Models) must take into account, not only local boundary conditions, but 

also, the meteorological history of the MBL air. This points to the need for prognostic, instead 

of diagnostic, MBL cloud parameterization schemes (e.g., Tiedtke 1993). 

Regarding the cloud transition that happens in the trades downwind from the regional Sc 

maximum, it has been mentioned that it is associated with a deeper MBL and with SSTs higher 

than those found in the Sc-dominated areas. In the transition region the stratiform clouds tend 

to be confined to a relatively thin layer immediately below the inversion layer, and are 

typically decoupled from the surface as a source of moisture, except during the presence of 

cumulus associated with intermittent convection (e.g., Bretherton 1992; Klein et al. 1995). 

Additional data on the thickness and temperature contrast of the inversion indicate that, as the 

MBL height increases, the intensity of the inversion, defined as the combination of those two 

quantities (Neiburger et al. 1961), decreases, which allows for an easier entrainment on the 

MBL of relatively dry air from the free troposphere above it. The combined effect of the 

decoupling from the surface and of the thinning of the stratiform cloud layer, is, by itself, 

responsible for an increased efficacy of the cloud dissipation by solar energy absorption, and, 

consequently, favors larger diurnal variations of cloud cover. This enhanced diurnal cycle of 

low cloudiness in the Sc-to-ShCu transition areas was observed during ASTEX (Albrecht et al. 

1995). 

- 11 - 



-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - 

However, the mechanism responsible for the restoration of the stratiform cloud layer, that 

occurs during the night, is less clear. The humidity flux associated with intermittent convective 

clouds could contribute for the renewal of the stratus layer in parts of the region where 

convection coexists with thin stratus, but, in regions where the diurnal cycle is more 

pronounced, there seems to be the need for an additional mechanism. A possible candidate is 

the nocturnal substitution of air heated during the day, by the advection of colder and saturated 

air from upwind (e.g. Wang et al. 1993). 

Finally, since low clouds have a much more significant effect on top of the atmosphere 

shortwave radiative fluxes than on longwave radiative fluxes, the diurnal variations of the 

cloud cover associated with this type of clouds are particularly important to estimate cloud-

induced changes in the planetary radiative balance. Seasonal variations of the diurnal cycle 

show that the largest diurnal cycle amplitudes occur during the summer months in both 

hemispheres (Rozendaal et al. 1995). 

2.3 Physical processes 

In Fig. 2.3, the key processes discussed above, whose interplay is thought to contribute to the 

formation, maintenance, and breakup of low stratiform cloudiness in the (subtropical) MBL, 

are illustrated. In addition, Fig. 2.3 introduces intermittent drizzle, longwave heating, and 

microphysical variability as fundamental factors for understanding cloud and cloudy boundary 

layer evolvement. A quick summary of the main physical processes and how they compete in 

determining the phenomenology of the cloudy MBL is given in the next paragraphs. 

The longwave cloud-top radiative cooling is, to a great extent, responsible for driving the 

convective turbulence in the MBL, but also spurs turbulent entrainment of relatively warm and 

dry air from the overlying free troposphere. This entrainment tends to result in a deepening of 

the MBL, against the large-scale subtropical subsidence. The radiative cooling is counteracted 

by entrainment warming, and surface heat fluxes, while the drying effect of cloud-top 

entrainment is counteracted by surface moisture fluxes (e.g., DYCOMS-II [Stevens et al. 

2003]; Stevens 2005). 

Concerning the humidity structure of the free troposphere, the greater the moisture content of 

the overlying environment, the more downwelling longwave radiation will be felt at cloud top. 

This can offset the longwave radiative cooling, and potentially lead to a decrease of convective 

turbulence associated with cloud-top cooling. Such a situation tends to favor the decoupling of 

- 12 - 



-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - 

the cloud layer from the surface as a source of moisture (Bretherton and Wyant 1997; Stevens 

2000), and may result in a thinning of the stratiform clouds. On the other hand, if a moist 

overlying environment extends all the way down to the cloud level, the potential reduction of 

the drying of the cloud layer due to the entrainment of overlying (in this case relatively moist) 

air may, overall, counteract the effects of the aforementioned decoupling, and even favor cloud 

formation (e.g., Sandu et al. 2010). 

 

Figure 2.3 - Schematic representation of the physical and dynamical processes that affect the cloud-topped 
maritime boundary layer (adapted from Garratt 1992). 

Another mechanism that may contribute to the breakup of this type of cloud layer, known as 

cloud-top entrainment instability (CTEI, Lilly 1968; Randall 1980; Deardorff 1980; Siems 

1991, Kawai and Teixeira 2010), is thought to take place when subsaturated air, entrained in 

the cloud layer, is subsequently cooled by evaporation to the point of becoming negatively 

buoyant. The consequence is, potentially, the enhancement of the turbulent entrainment of 

more subsaturated air, in a positive feedback that ultimately results in a thinning, and eventual 

breakup, of the cloud layer (Yamaguchi and Randall [2008], question the effectiveness of this 

feedback as being responsible for cloud dissipation). It is also possible that the combination of 

(intermittent) drizzle (e.g., Paluch and Lenschow 1991) and latent heat release in the cloud 

layer (Bretherton and Wyant 1997), leads to MBL decoupling conditions, if they happen to

-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - 

offset the effects of cloud-top radiative cooling on the convective turbulence. Once again, the 

cloud layer would undergo a thinning and, possibly, breakup. 

As previously mentioned, thinner cloud layers are more prone to dissipation by solar energy 

absorption (shortwave radiative heating). This situation favors relatively large diurnal 

variations of cloud cover in regions where these thinner cloud layers tend to be more abundant 

(e.g., the Sc-to-ShCu transition areas of the maritime subtropics). 

A deeper understanding of the interplay between the physical processes presented above, and 

of its modulation by the large-scale dynamics and environmental conditions, is crucial for the 

improvement of the numerical representation of clouds. 

2.4 Cloud parameterization 

In the first attempts at climate simulation with GCMs, clouds were prescribed. Their 

distribution was then usually introduced in the models as climatological values of zonal means, 

ignoring its spatiotemporal variation (e.g. Holloway and Manabe 1971). An important step 

forward in cloud modelling happened with the inclusion of the effects of important parameters 

such as relative humidity, vertical velocity, and static stability in the numerical schemes for the 

representation of clouds. That resulted in a more realistic simulation of cloud-related 

properties. The following paragraphs present a brief overview of some of the main topics of 

GCM cloud parameterization. 

A fundamental aspect of atmospheric modelling is the difference between the two basic 

components of a GCM, the (large-scale) dynamics component, and the physics 

(parameterization) component. While the equations that govern the dynamics are well known 

(e.g., Navier-Stokes equations of motion), the lack of previously established equations for most 

of the physics, requires the use of (elaborate) conceptual schemes. This is, primarily, due to the 

fact that a number of physical process, such as, the ones associated with radiative transfer, 

turbulent mixing, orographic forcing, moist convection, surface fluxes, or clouds, which have a 

significant impact on the large-scale circulation, occur at spatial scales smaller than those 

typically resolved by atmospheric models. It is the need to somehow represent the effects on 

the atmospheric flow of these subscale mechanisms that is behind the development of 

parameterization schemes. Or, in other words, the combined influence of the subscale 

processes needs to be formulated in terms of the basic variables resolved by the models. The 

- 14 - 



-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - 

simulation of boundary layer clouds by a GCM relies on a delicate balance between the 

different physical processes parameterized. 

Three main types of cloud parameterization schemes have been used in climate and weather 

prediction models for some time: i) empirical “diagnostic” parameterizations in which the 

cloud cover is diagnosed as a function of relative humidity and some additional variables (e.g., 

Slingo 1980); ii) parameterizations in which cloud cover and cloud water are diagnosed based 

in the probability distribution of the subscale variability of thermodynamic variables – PDF 

(Probability Density Function)-based cloud schemes (e.g., Mellor 1977; Sommeria and 

Deardorff 1977); iii) “prognostic” parameterizations for liquid/solid water and or for the cloud 

cover (e.g., Sundqvist 1988; Tiedtke 1993). 

The scheme proposed by Slingo (1980) is essentially based on the diagnostic relations between 

cloud cover and relative humidity. One of the main goals of the scheme was then try to 

represent stratocumulus in a realistic way, given their known importance in the climate system. 

This was one of the reasons why diagnostic information about the strength of the inversion at 

the BL-top was also included in the cloud cover parameterization. The link between the 

amount of stratiform clouds and the intensity of the inversion, briefly described in the previous 

sections for the subtropical latitudes, is based on observational data (e.g., von Ficker 1936; 

Klein and Hartmann 1993) whose climatology indicates that, except in the Arctic region, the 

season with more stratus is simultaneously the one for which the low troposphere static 

stability is the highest. However, there is in this diagnostic scheme the possibility of a strong 

positive feedback, since the cloud-top radiative cooling intensifies the inversion which, in turn, 

results in an increase in the amount of cloud, and so on. Slingo (1987) discusses this feedback 

in view of observations that suggest its occurrence in the BL. Notwithstanding, the 

parameterization scheme proposed by Slingo was probably the first one able to (with GCMs) 

realistically simulate cloud cover associated with stratocumulus. 

Contrary to Slingo’s diagnostic scheme, developed for GCMs, the Sommeria-Deardorff-Mellor 

(1977) scheme was initially applied in CSRMs (Cloud-System-Resolving Models) of the BL. 

Only later they were used in GCMs (e.g., Smith 1984). This scheme is based on the statistical 

description of subscale condensation processes. In its original paper, Sommeria and Deardorff 

(1977) proposed a scheme in which it was needed to evaluate double integrals, while Mellor 

(1977) demonstrated that the problem could be reduced to integration in a single variable. 

PDF-based parameterizations constitute, theoretically, an ideal framework for the development 

of subscale cloud parameterizations, and for the coupling of its sources and dissipative 

- 15 - 



-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - 

processes with parameterization schemes for convection and turbulence. Additionally, owing 

to the intrinsically continuous nature of a PDF, the problems with discontinuities, affecting 

many of the current cloud parameterization packages that deal with physical processes with 

associated critical limits (thresholds), can be avoided. The biggest issue with these methods is, 

however, the determination of the characteristics of the PDF itself, for different situations and 

cloud types. Some studies have showed that a careful choice of the probability distributions for 

each specific case yields good results, thus indicating the large applicability of this kind of 

schemes. See, for instance, the results of the investigation of the subtropical Sc-to-ShCu 

transition in Bechtold et al. (1995), and Cuijpers and Bechtold (1995). 

A statistical scheme presents some advantages when compared to a prognostic scheme, 

primarily, because it is based on, fairly solid, physical and mathematical concepts, but also 

because it is diagnostic, thus needing less computational memory and being less prone to 

numerical instability. However, the implementation of these parameterizations in GCMs can be 

somewhat difficult, given the complexity of some of its components. Lastly, there is also the 

problem with the representation of other types of clouds other than the ones associated with the 

BL, for which the scheme has been validate (e.g., Teixeira 2000). 

The implementation of prognostic schemes in GCMs is relatively recent. Until 1991, cloud 

prognostic schemes treated cloud cover through diagnostic relations (e.g., Sundqvist 1988). 

During that same year an alternative prognostic scheme for the cloud cover was firstly 

proposed (Tiedtke 1991; Tiedtke 1993). The scheme was inspired by the need to link the 

sources of liquid water and cloud cover to convection, and, essentially, consists of two 

prognostic equations, one for the liquid/solid water (allowing both to coexist), and the other 

one for cloud cover. In the scheme, the cloud production and dissipation (including BL clouds) 

is linked to the parameterized physical processes (convection, vertical movement, radiative 

heating, turbulence), which is desirable, and allows the representation of the main feedback 

processes among them. However, the intricacy of this link imposes added difficulty to the 

evaluation of the scheme’s global performance, since errors in a certain component can be 

reflected on the parameters associated with cloud cover, which, in turn, will, potentially, be felt 

in the rest of the model (e.g., Jakob 1999). 

An important limitation to the GCMs’ ability of correctly representing clouds, is the vertical 

resolution adopted. It is well known that a realistic representation of the BL processes requires 

an adequate vertical resolution in the lower troposphere and, particularly, at the level of the 

inversion layer at the top of the BL. To tackle that issue, in addition to variable vertical 

- 16 - 



-    Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans    - 

resolution, there is the need for adaptative grids able to adjust themselves to an inversion 

known to have  important spatiotemporal variation (as discussed in the previous sections). 

Another important issue has to do with the fact that the different parameterization schemes that 

comprise the physics of a GCM, differ from each other in terms of the layers of the atmosphere 

were, ideally, they need higher vertical resolution (e.g. van Meijgaard and van Ulden 1998; 

Lenderink and Holtslag 2000).

3 The  GPCI project 

3.1 Introduction 

The importance of atmospheric model intercomparison in climate studies was emphasized in 

1989 by the Joint Scientific Committee (JSC) of the World Climate Research Program 

(WCRP). There was then the need for more comprehensive and standardized climate model 

intercomparison efforts. In 1992 the JSC endorsed the creation of GCSS (Global energy and 

water cycle experiment [GEWEX] Cloud System Study) as a long term program (Browning et 

al. 1993; Browning et al. 1994; Randall et al. 2003). GPCI (Global energy and water cycle 

experiment cloud system study / working group on numerical experimentation Pacific Cross-

section Intercomparison) was established in 2004 and joined GCSS a year later (Teixeira et al. 

2008a; Teixeira et al. 2011). GPCI is part of the GCSS’s GCM (General Circulation Model) 

community and is dedicated to the intercomparison of three-dimensional (3D) global and 

regional models. 

3.1.1 Background 

The GPCI project can be seen as a follow-up to the 3D model intercomparison performed 

under the European Cloud Systems Study (EUROCS) along a similar cross section in the 

(sub)tropical NE Pacific ocean (Siebesma et al. 2004). The focus was on the June-July-August 

(JJA) season, but only monthly means at four times during the day were available during 

EUROCS. Although meaningful conclusions on model deficiencies could be drawn, the coarse 

temporal resolution didn’t allow for a detailed study of the diurnal cycle. Moreover, there was 

a lack of observational data with which to validate important aspects of the model simulations, 

such as the vertical structure of tropospheric temperature and humidity, which had to be 

evaluated solely against reanalysis data (known to have limitations, especially over remote 

areas of the global oceans). 

As will be seen below in more detail, at the core of GPCI’s setup and project protocol is a 

request for high temporal resolution 3-hourly model output, and observational data. Also a step 

further from EUROCS is the recent availability of satellite retrievals of the vertical structure of 

important cloud-related parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, cloud occurrence) from a new 

- 18 - 



-    The  GPCI project    - 

generation of sensors and platforms (e.g., AIRS [Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder], and 

CloudSat). 

Finally, GPCI is open to the participation of a larger number of atmospheric modelling centers, 

including American institutions (not present in EUROCS). Also, the inclusion in GPCI of more 

recent model versions from the centers that participated in EUROCS will allow for an 

evaluation of the respective model development efforts. 

3.1.2 Main goals 

As part of the GCSS community, the main goal of GPCI is to characterize deficiencies in the 

representation of (sub)tropical clouds and cloud-related processes in climate and weather 

prediction models, with an emphasis on different cloud and convection regimes and on the 

transitions between them. The GPCI framework is specifically set up for the investigation of 

three fundamental cloud regimes that typically occur over the eastern boundaries of the 

(sub)tropical oceans, namely, stratocumulus, shallow cumulus, and deep cumulus. Knowledge 

gained from a detailed analysis of the behaviour of these cloud systems, and associated 

dynamical and thermodynamical environments, in models and observations should offer 

insight for the improvement and development of new parameterizations of clouds, boundary 

layer, and convection.  

A number of core scientific questions guide the progression of the GPCI activities, among 

them: what controls the diurnal cycle of cloud properties over the (sub)tropical oceans?; how 

do models represent these processes?; what is the humidity structure in the subtropical upper 

troposphere?; can models simulate it?; can the current tools for model diagnostic and 

validation, and available observational data, reveal the deficiencies in the cloud, convection, 

and boundary layer parameterizations used in state-of-the-art climate and weather prediction 

models?; how to make GPCI results a reference point for future model development efforts? 

To answer these questions GPCI is, at the present stage, primarily focused on: ? gathering 

model and observational data for the JJA season in the GPCI geographical location; ? 

developing and exploring methodologies for the study of important (sub)tropical cloud regimes 

(stratocumulus, shallow cumulus, and deep convection) and respective transitions; ? evaluating 

models and observations for a characterization of the hydrologic cycle; ? understanding the 

role of the interplay between the large-scale dynamics and environmental factors in the 

behaviour of the different cloud regimes; ? using and validating the newest generations of 

cloud-related satellite datasets, namely in what concerns the vertical structure of temperature, 

- 19 - 



-    The  GPCI project    - 

humidity, and clouds; ? describing the (maritime) atmospheric boundary layer representation 

in models and in observations; and ? helping the participating centers in the development new 

parameterizations. 

The GPCI approach has already proven useful in the fulfillment of some of these goals (e.g., 

Teixeira et al. 2008a; Karlsson et al. 2010; Teixeira et al. 2011). 

3.2 Setup 

3.2.1 The NE Pacific Summer 

Given GPCI’s main goals summarized above (Section 3.1.2), and the fact that the project 

envisioned the participation of a large number of modelling centers and the extensive use of a 

variety of observational datasets, there was the need to focus the investigation on a confined 

geographical area to avoid a computationally demanding data treatment and analysis. This, and 

the desire to include in the study fundamental (sub)tropical cloud systems, led to the choice of 

the (sub)tropical NE Pacific ocean region. In fact, the large-scale and environmental conditions 

found in the NE Pacific area, can, in general, be found in similar regions of the eastern 

boundaries of the (sub)tropical oceans (e.g., Klein and Hartmann 1993; Sandu et al. 2010). 

More specifically, the GPCI region is confined between -5ºN to 45ºN and 160ºE to 120ºW, an 

area from the coast of California to the Equator, previously the focus of a number of studies of 

the maritime boundary-layer clouds and cloud-related processes (e.g., Riehl et al. 1951; Klein 

and Hartmann 1993; Fetzer et al. 2004; Siebesma et al. 2004; Karlsson et al. 2010; Sandu et al. 

2010; Teixeira et al. 2011). In terms of the large-scale dynamics, the phenomenology in the 

region is dominated by the Hadley circulation, with deep convection in the inter-tropical 

convergence zone (ITCZ), and large-scale subsidence in the subtropics. Fundamental cloud 

regimes of interest for the GCSS can be found in this oceanic region reasonably well separated 

in three main cloud regimes, namely, stratocumulus, shallow cumulus, and deep cumulus, 

often showing characteristic cloudiness transition behaviour. The mean circulation in the 

region allows a study of the main features associated with the cloud phenomenology resorting 

only to individual cross sections aligned parallel to the low level trajectories of the atmospheric 

flow (see Section 3.5 Representativeness of the cross-section). Moreover, the persistency of a 

relatively well defined Hadley circulation implies that meaningful conclusions can be taken 

from the investigation of a time period of only a few months. Choosing JJA as the study period 

is, in part, based on: i) the fact that this season typically exhibits small sea surface temperature 

- 20 - 



-    The  GPCI project    - 

(SST) anomaly in the region (1 K to 2 K, overall [see Fig. 4.1]); ii) it is the season of 

maximum occurrence of low clouds (Fig. 3.1); and iii) because the diurnal cycle presents its 

peak amplitude during the summertime (e.g., Rozendaal et al. 1995). 

Figure 3.1 illustrates the location of the GPCI cross section in the NE Pacific from the coast of 

California to the equatorial region, superimposed on a JJA climatology of the low (boundary 

layer) cloud cover obtained from International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) 

observational data.

cover (%) climatology for the June-July-August season (courtesy Dr. Cecile Hannay). 

3.2.2 Project protocol 

GPCI can be seen as a level-2 model intercomparison project (Gates 1992) in which all the 

participating models have to follow the same line of predefined project specifications and 

protocols: i) simulations made under standard conditions; ii) common diagnostics in standard 

format; and iii) validation against common data. 

Though standardized, the specifications are kept at a relatively generic level with the basic 

condition being that the models run in climate mode (i.e., without data assimilation) and using 

prescribed SSTs as boundary condition. As the period of interest is the JJA season (1998 and 

2003), it is advised that the numeric simulations begin by the 20th of May. The requested 

output corresponds to the period between the 1st of June and the 31st of August. Regarding the 

geographical area of interest, it is requested that model data be sent for: i) 13 locations along 

the GPCI cross section, starting at 35ºN, 125ºW and moving southwestwards at 4º longitude 

and 3º latitude steps until -1ºN, 173ºW; ii) locations every 5 × 5 degrees in a grid ranging from 

-5ºN to 45ºN and 160ºE to 240ºE (referred to below as the 2D maps). Finally, the simulation 

- 21 - 



-    The  GPCI project    - 

results are to be submitted in high temporal resolution (every 3 hours at 00, 03, 06, 09, 12, 15, 

18, and 21 UTC), and at full vertical resolution, i.e., on model levels. 

The following is a list of the different variables of the GPCI standard output. 

Vertical profiles as a function of pressure (10 parameters): pressure (hPa), potential 

temperature (K), specific humidity (g/kg), relative humidity (%), zonal wind (m/s), meridional 

wind (m/s), vertical velocity (Pa/s), cloud cover (%), liquid water content (g/kg), ice water 

content (g/kg). 

Single-level variables (18 parameters): sea surface temperature (K), outgoing longwave 

radiation (W/m2), surface downward longwave radiation (W/m2), net shortwave radiation at the 

top of the atmosphere (W/m2), surface net shortwave radiation (W/m2), surface downward 

shortwave radiation (W/m2), surface latent heat flux (W/m2), surface sensible heat flux (W/m2), 

total cloud cover (%), total column water vapour (kg/m2), liquid water path (g/m2), ice water

atmosphere net clear sky shortwave radiation (W/m2), top of the atmosphere clear sky 

longwave radiation (W/m2), surface net clear sky shortwave radiation (W/m2), surface net clear

humidity at 850 hPa (%), relative humidity at 200 hPa (%), vertical velocity at 300 hPa (Pa/s), 

vertical velocity at 700 hPa (Pa/s). 

3.3 Participating models

3.4 Observational datasets 

In GPCI, a special attention is given to satellite data, seen as the truth against which to evaluate 

the model simulations. In fact, satellite observations have been a crucial tool for recent 

progress in the understanding of clouds as key players in the climate system (e.g., Ramanathan 

et al. 1989; Harrison et al. 1990; Rossow and Schiffer 1991; Rossow and Schiffer 1999; 

Wielicki et al. 1995; Chylek et al. 2007), and for the validation of climate and weather 

prediction models (e.g., Cess et al. 1997; Webb et al. 2001; Randall et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 

2005). 

A collection of satellite data has been prepared for GPCI by the GCSS Data Integration for 

Model Evaluation (DIME) initiative. These datasets include high temporal resolution data from 

- 23 - 



-    The  GPCI project    - 

the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), together with daily products 

from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), the Global Precipitation Climatology 

Project (GPCP), and the Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) Operational 

Vertical Sounder (TOVS). Given it’s 3-hourly temporal resolution, the ISCCP cloud data has 

been particularly useful  in the study of cloud regime transitions in the GPCI region. Note, 

however, that the model total cloud cover simulations have, this far, been directly compared 

against ISCCP total cloud cover information, without resort to the ISCCP simulator (Klein and 

Jakob 1999; Webb et al. 2001), a tool that converts cloud-related information from the models 

into ISCCP cloud properties (cloud top pressure, cloud amount, and cloud optical thickness). 

No ISCCP simulator output was requested because many of the participating centers had not 

implemented the tool in their respective models. 

In fact, the bulk of the observational data used in this study was retrieved from the GCSS-

DIME Web site in formats prepared for the GPCI project area of interest: see “CROSS-PAC” 

and “GPCI” at http://gcss-dime.giss.nasa.gov/. CERES (Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy 

System) ES9 (Earth Radiation Budget Experiment [ERBE]-like Science product 9) data were 

obtained from the Atmospheric Science Data Center (ASDC) at the National Aeronautics and 

Space Administration (NASA) Langley Research Center (http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/). The 

SSM/I data and images are produced by Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) and sponsored by the 

NASA Pathfinder Program for early Earth Observing System (EOS) products. SSM/I is 

onboard polar orbiting satellites, property of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program 

(DMSP). Retrievals from three DMSP satellites carrying SSM/I (F11, F13, and F14) 

operational during JJA 1998 were used. RSS SSM/I can be found online at 

http://www.remss.com/ssmi/ssmi_description.html. The GPCP dataset combines precipitation 

information from several sources. Microwave estimates are based on SSM/I, infrared (IR) 

precipitation estimates are obtained from geostationary satellites and polar-orbiting satellites, 

and gauge data are assembled and analyzed by the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre 

(GPCC). A hierarchy of geostationary (GOES [Geostationary Operational Environmental 

Satellite], GMS [Geosynchronous Meteorological Satellite], Meteosat) and polar orbiting 

(NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]) satellites are used by ISCCP to 

retrieve and calculate cloud related products. 

Other important observational datasets used in GPCI are opportunely described in following 

sections of this thesis, whenever specifically applied for model evaluation, these include: cloud 

occurrence information from CloudSat and CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared 

- 24 - 



-    The  GPCI project    - 

Pathfinder Satellite Observations), cloud-top-height data from MISR (Multiangle Imaging

information from TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission).

3.5 Representativeness of the cross section 

As mentioned above in the GPCI project protocol (Section 3.2.2), in addition to the data 

requested for the 13 locations along the GPCI cross section, seven parameters are requested for 

a larger domain, the “2D maps”, encompassing the section and a broad area of the (sub)tropical 

NE Pacific. Two basic ideas are behind these maps: 1) the fact that a single cross section may 

miss relevant phenomena occurring in its vicinities (e.g., the diurnal cycle over the 

stratocumulus regions close to the coast of California may be modulated by subsidence caused 

by convection events over land, which can only be inferred from the analysis of the land 

portion of the 2D maps, since the GPCI transect is exclusively maritime); and 2) the need to 

answer the question about the representativeness of the transect, in the sense of, to what degree 

can any findings based solely on the analysis of data along the transect be extrapolated to the 

- 25 - 



-    The  GPCI project    - 

broader area of the (sub)tropical NE Pacific. This last point is addressed in the next paragraphs 

resorting to two different types of results. 

Firstly, ERA-40 winds are used to produce histograms of wind direction in a number of 

transect locations to infer the degree of alignment of the GPCI section relative to the low level 

trajectories of the atmospheric flow. More precisely, 1000 hPa and 900 hPa JJA 1998 winds 

were analyzed at six different locations, as shown in Fig. 3.2. 

 

Figure 3.2 - Histograms of wind direction at 1000 hPa for six points along the GPCI transect from ERA-40 for 
June-July-August (JJA) 1998. 

Figure 3.2 shows the wind direction histograms corresponding to the 1000 hPa level, for points 

2°N, 8°N, 14°N, 20°N, 26°N, and 32°N. For the sake of brevity, the corresponding results for 

the 900 hPa level are not shown here. From these histograms it is apparent that, for most of its 

span, the winds tend to be reasonably parallel to the transect (especially between 8°N and 

26°N, at 1000 hPa, and 14°N and 26°N, at 900 hPa). This comes in support of the, previously 

mentioned, argument that it is possible to study the main features associated with the cloud 

phenomenology in the GPCI region by resorting only to individual cross sections. Note, 

however, that, individually, the participating models may differ from ERA-40 in this regard, 

though, as shown in the next chapter, all of them simulate the main features of the regional

Hadley circulation (as seen in the respective seasonal means along the cross section), thus 

suggesting that the southeasterly advection of boundary layer air, is, in the models (as in ERA-

40), fairly parallel to the GPCI cross section. 

The second type of analysis resorts to information from the 2D maps to obtain histograms of 

cloud-related variables, such as total cloud cover (TCC) and precipitation, not only for the 

cross section locations but also for longitudinally adjacent points (5° to the east and to the 

west). Figure 3.3 shows, for the GFDL and the NCAR models, the precipitation histograms for 

one GPCI point (5°N, 195°E), and two adjacent points, obtained for JJA 1998. Figure 3.4 

shows TCC histograms for the same models and season (the GPCI point is now 20°N, 215°E). 

 

Figure 3.3 - Histograms of precipitation from the NCAR and GFDL models for one GPCI point (5°N, 195°E) and 
two adjacent (5° to the east and west along the same latitude) points for June-July-August 1998. 

For the two parameters shown, there is a clear similarity of the respective histograms between 

adjacent points for a given model, though quite different results can be found between the two 

models presented. This is still the case for other transect points and models (not shown).  

Once again, these results support the idea that the single-section approach used in GPCI may 

be able to provide robust conclusions on main model physical processes, not only for the cross 

section itself, but, as seen in Fig. 3.3 and Fig. 3.4, for the broader region of the (sub)tropics it 

represents.

4 Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations 

This chapter focuses on the first results obtained for GPCI and is intended to give an overview 

of the mean characteristics of the summertime atmospheric hydrologic cycle in the 

(sub)tropical NE Pacific as seen in model simulations and in observations, with an emphasis on 

the vertical distribution of clouds, and on processes involving dynamical and environmental 

factors that play a role in the maintenance of total and low cloud fields on a seasonal time 

scale. 

The analysis presented here is in part based on the results published in Teixeira et al. (2011), a 

work that benefited from substantial contributions from the author of this dissertation. 

4.1 Sea surface temperatures 

As stated in the previous chapter, the basic request for the numerical simulations for GPCI was 

the use of prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) as a boundary condition for the climate 

runs, and, except for the coupled ocean-atmosphere version of the NCEP model, this was the 

case for the participating models, though resorting to the use of slightly different SST analysis 

datasets and implementation techniques. A quick look at the seasonal mean of the SSTs 

reported along the GPCI transect is presented below in Fig. 4.1 for June-July-August (JJA) 

1998 and 2003.

-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - 

Three main features can be identified in both plots in Fig. 4.1, namely: i) a quasi-linear 

southward increase of SST along the trade winds, from about 290 K of the relatively cold 

waters off the coast of California (35°N), to about 301 K, close to 10°N; ii) practically constant 

values in the area under the influence of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) (5°N to 

11°N); and iii) a slight decrease south of the ITCZ. There is, however, some dispersion among 

the values from individual models, particularly notorious north of 17°N for JJA 2003. Going 

from 1998 to 2003, there is an overall increase of the SSTs along the transect, more 

pronounced in its northern half, with an associated decrease in the mean latitudinal SST 

gradient. For illustration purposes, the monthly and seasonal mean “transect averages” are 

shown for two analysis products from ECMWF (ERA-40 [1998] and ECMWFan [2003]). 

These indicate that the increase in the seasonal “transect average” from 1998 to 2003 is mostly 

due to an accentuated monthly increase in the SSTs from June to July and August 2003 (note 

that the value for June is lower in 2003 than in 1998). 

Finally, the SSTs obtained with the only coupled simulations available (NCEP GFS and 

MOM3 [NCEP G&amp;amp;M3, in Fig. 4.1]) show very small differences between 1998 and 2003, 

except in the southernmost portion of the transect, where, even though increased in 2003, the 

SSTs are still below those from the other models, and are, interestingly, more similar to the 

1998 values from ERA-40. Regarding the relatively warm values obtained during JJA 1998 in 

the subtropical regions, it can be argued that these may in part be associated with 

underrepresentation of cloud cover probably linked to an important feedback between low 

clouds and the SST. 

4.2 Single-level parameters 

This section is dedicated exclusively to JJA 1998 results. Figure 4.2 shows the seasonal mean 

values of a number of single-level cloud-related parameters. A brief description of these mean 

fields along the GPCI cross section is given here. A more detailed view can be found in 

Teixeira et al. (2011). 

The analysis starts with total column water vapor (TWV) shown in Fig. 4.2a. TWV’s integral 

nature gives it a key role in the understanding of the atmospheric hydrologic cycle. TWV 

observations from SSM/I are shown along with reanalysis from ERA-40, and model simulation 

results represented by the model ensemble average, obtained from the individual seasonal 

means, and the across-model variability, as seen in the ensemble average plus or minus one

-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - 

TWV seems to mimic the behaviour of the SST field described above for the portion of the 

GPCI transect between the stratocumulus regions off California and the ITCZ. In SSM/I terms, 

the TWV increases from around 18 kg m-2 in the northernmost part of the transect (35°N) to 

about 50 kg m-2 at 8°N. Climatologically, these are  major changes in the atmospheric column 

and are related to the transition from a shallow boundary layer, capped by a dry upper 

troposphere, to a regime characterized by fully developed moist convection events that reach 

deeper as one approaches the ITCZ. The good agreement between SSM/I and ERA-40 for 

TWC is worthy of notice and, although somewhat expected, given the fact that ERA-40 

assimilates related observational information, can be seen as indicative of good quality of the 

SSM/I data, while suggesting that ERA-40 reproduces well the component of the hydrological 

cycle responsible for this integral parameter. Unfortunately, this high degree of agreement is 

uncommon for the other variables analyzed, as will be seen later. The TWV average for the 

ensemble of models is also very close to the observations and the reanalysis in all points of the 

transect, with a relatively small (as compared to other variables) across-model standard 

deviation. Note, however, that the model range reveal important departures from the 

observational truth, of concern especially in the stratocumulus regions (north of 29°N) and in 

the deep tropics (south of 11°N), where the range is O(20 kg m-2). To a great extent, the 

situation in the stratocumulus is concomitant with the models’ representation of the boundary 

layer, and particularly with its vertical reach, a key feature of the cloudy boundary layer. This 

will be discussed throughout the remainder of the chapter, and will receive a special focus in 

Chapter 6. 

Figure 4.2b shows the seasonal mean total cloud cover (TCC) field along the GPCI transect for 

models, ERA-40, and ISCCP observations. Compared to the TWV results, TCC has an 

accentuated degree of scatter, as seen in the model range and standard deviation, confirming 

the poor ability of current weather and climate prediction models to simulate clouds. Both 

ERA-40 and the model ensemble average present important departures from the observations, 

in contrast with the results discussed above for TWV. More specifically, note in ERA-40 the 

negative bias in the stratocumulus and initial transition to cumulus (23°N to 35°N), and the 

positive bias in the ITCZ. In turn, the ensemble average follows the ISCCP TCC relatively 

well up to 20°N, but is even more negatively biased (-20 % to -30 % bias), as compared to the 

observations, than ERA-40 north of that location. Contributing to this situation, is the 

existence, among the available models, of extremely low values of seasonal mean TCC in the 

stratocumulus regime. Finally, it is important to bear in mind that the current ISCCP products 

- 32 - 



-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - 

have uncertainties, particularly for tropical TCC, which is underestimated by about 10 % to 15 

%, due to non detection of very thin cirrus (e.g., Stubenrauch et al. 1999). Nevertheless, at the 

present, it is believed that the ISCCP cloud cover product is more reliable than ERA-40, a 

reanalysis obtained without assimilation of explicit cloud information (more recent ECMWF 

reanalysis efforts have shown improvement in the representation of maritime low clouds 

[Köhler 2005; Hannay et al. 2009] relative to ERA-40). 

In relative terms, what is said above about the behaviour of ERA-40 and model ensemble 

average TCC, as compared to ISCCP observations, is still valid for the liquid water path 

(LWP) parameter, shown in Fig. 4.2c with observations from SSM/I, namely: i) both ERA-40 

and the ensemble average are below SSM/I in the stratocumulus regions; ii) ERA-40 

overestimates LWP over the trade cumulus regions (unlike the ensemble average); iii) in the 

deep tropics, ERA-40 clearly exceeds SSM/I (350 g m-2 versus 200 g m-2), where the ensemble 

average stays close to the observations. Apart from the absolute peak value in the ITCZ, the 

rest of the cross section (to the north) is characterized by a relatively modest variation of 

SSM/I LWP, with a minimum value of about 55 g m-2 at 14°N, a maximum value of about 110 

g m-2 at 26°N, and a value of about 80 g m-2 at 35°N. That said, it should be noted that 

microwave instruments such as SSM/I do have significant uncertainties (see Li et al. 2008, for 

a comparison of LWP products from different satellite observations). The improvement of 

these observational issues depends on how successful more recent instruments, such as those 

onboard CloudSat (e.g., Stephens et al. 2002), will be, in helping to clarify and reduce the 

uncertainties that affect LWP. 

Figure 4.2d presents seasonal mean precipitation with observations from GPCP. The first 

noticeable feature is the key difference (common to all datasets analyzed) between the 

subtropical regions, where (low) boundary layer clouds prevail, and the ITCZ, dominated by 

deep convection. In particular, the subtropics receive very small amounts of precipitation, 

except in the case of (at least) one model with maximum values close to 2 mm day-1 in the 

trade cumulus regions. In the ITCZ, GPCP amounts to around 9 mm day-1, slightly below the 

model ensemble average, and about half the value for ERA-40. Traditionally, it has been 

difficult to obtain accurate observations of precipitation in relatively dry areas such as the 

subtropics (e.g., Adler et al. 2003) and for this reason the error bars for the GPCP product in 

these regions will be relatively large (e.g., Janowiak et al. 1998) and (percentwise) more 

important than in the ITCZ.

-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - 

In Fig. 4.2e, outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) results are shown, with observations from 

CERES. For the subtropical regions, the model ensemble average, and ERA-40, give OLR 

values that are, respectively, lower, and higher, than the observations. In the ITCZ-dominated 

regions, ERA-40 has a negative bias of about 20 W m-2 relative to CERES data, while the 

ensemble average closely follows the observations. As expected, the underestimation of OLR 

in ERA-40 is consistent with ERA-40’s positive biases of TCC, LWP, and precipitation in the 

ITCZ. 

With observations from CERES, Fig. 4.2f presents results for the net shortwave radiative flux 

at the top of the atmosphere (NSRTOA). It is clear that the reanalysis and the ensemble 

average have similar values in the subtropical regions and all the way to 14°N, but, while in the 

stratocumulus areas (north of 23°N) both ERA-40 and the model average are above the 

observations by up to 50 W m-2 (owing to the negative bias in cloud cover and cloud water), in 

the shallow cumulus regions (between 14°N and 23°N), in turn, both underestimate NSRTOA. 

In ERA-40 this is consistent with the described overestimation of LWP in the trades. A 

possible explanation for the corresponding bias of the ensemble average may come from the 

fact that trade wind cumuli have been found to be too reflective in climate model simulations 

as compared to observations (e.g., Potter and Cess 2004; Karlsson et al. 2008). Further south, 

in the ITCZ area, the ensemble average is closer to CERES than ERA-40, which shows a 

negative NSRTOA bias of ~50 W m-2 (possibly in connection with the positive LWP and cloud 

cover bias found there). Finally, the high scatter among the models is, once again, problematic, 

and (more poignantly in the case of the shortwave radiation) points out to the need for greater 

model development efforts, especially thinking about the coupling between oceanic and 

atmospheric model components, with the purpose of seasonal and climate prediction (recall the 

case of the coupled model simulations in Fig. 4.1 [SSTs]). 

4.3 Profiles along the section 

In this section the results from three additional variables are analyzed. The focus is on their 

summertime seasonal distribution in the vertical along the GPCI cross section. Again, only a 

brief description of the mean fields is given, and for just a subset of the participating models. 

For a more comprehensive look, please refer to Teixeira et al. (2011).

Figure 4.3 shows the JJA 1998 seasonal mean subsidence field, as seen along the GPCI 

transect in model simulations and ERA-40 reanalysis. Qualitatively, the basic features 

associated with the regional Hadley circulation can be easily identified in all of the individual 

results presented: with upward motion in the ITCZ, and a broad area of downward motion 

characterizing the subtropical free troposphere. A closer look, however, reveals several 

substantial differences between the models, namely: very shallow upward-motion layers in the 

ITCZ (e.g., ETH/MPI); the width of the deep convection area (e.g., BMRC versus UKMO); 

and the strength of the deep convection (e.g. NCAR versus ERA-40).

-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - 

Less pronounced, but still important, are also the differences in the subsidence field in the 

subtropics, particularly for the free-troposphere above the trades (17°N to 23°N). 

Finally, note, how relatively low in the vertical profile, rather strong values of subsidence can 

be felt in ERA-40 (and to some extent in UKMO) between 14°N and 35°N. Knowing the role 

of the vertical structure of subsidence on the vertical extent of the (cloudy) boundary layer, the 

differences in model behaviour reported here can (at least) partly explain the differences in the 

simulated characteristics of boundary layer convection and clouds. 

The figure that follows presents the results pertaining to the seasonal mean relative humidity 

for ERA-40 and the same models analyzed in Fig. 4.3.

-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - 

A first glance at these profiles reveals that, qualitatively, the models and ERA-40 reproduce the 

main features of a Hadley-like circulation including: a moist boundary layer that evolves from 

shallow, in the northern portion of the transect, to deeper, in the trades; an ITCZ with high 

relative humidity values throughout the troposphere; and a very dry subtropical free 

troposphere (a result of the large-scale subsidence that dominates the local dynamics). 

However, as seen in the subsidence results, a more detailed comparison shows significant 

differences among the models. It should be kept in mind that, as a key player in the hydrologic 

cycle, relative humidity can be very informative of model deficiencies in its characterization. 

In the case of the simulated boundary layer (as perceived from the relative humidity signature), 

the most striking difference is in the way it grows from the stratocumulus to the shallow 

cumulus regions. In the ITCZ area, the differences pointed out above for the vertical velocity 

field are now even more obvious, especially in what concerns the strength and width of the 

deep convection. Another interesting feature is the minimum in relative humidity around 400 

hPa in the ITCZ (the models do not agree on its absolute value). To conclude, recall that a 

direct comparison between simulated and observed relative humidity is performed in Chapter 

6, resorting to satellite (AIRS) data. 

The last variable chosen for analysis in this section is (cloud) liquid water content, shown in 

Fig. 4.5 for models, ERA-40, and satellite observations from CloudSat (e.g., Stephens et al. 

2008). The CloudSat results correspond to the climatology for JJA for the period 2006 to 2010. 

Known issues with this observing system, especially in getting information close to the ground 

(in the first km above the surface), and insufficient vertical resolution (~ 250-500 m), affect its 

reliability in what concerns the boundary layer liquid water content, and can explain a 

somewhat flat stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition, as compared to most models (though 

overall showing a similar content of liquid water). Further south, in the deep tropical regions, 

the variety of cloud liquid water vertical structures among the datasets shown is striking, with 

some models (e.g., JAMSTEC) showing virtually no liquid water in the lower troposphere, 

while reporting its existence erroneously high in the  profile. Finally, it is apparent that UKMO 

is the model that most closely follows CloudSat’s observations of liquid water content, 

especially south of 26°N and up to 700 hPa in the ITCZ region, and thus, can be considered the 

most accurate simulation among the different models. Bear in mind, however, that such a 

conclusion is somewhat superficial, given the fact that the CloudSat retrieval algorithm uses a 

fairly simple mixed-phase relation resorting to temperature information from ECMWF 

analysis.

4.4 Vertical distribution of clouds 

Having analyzed the vertical distribution of subsidence, relative humidity, and liquid water 

content along the GPCI transect in the previous section, the attention will now be directed to 

cloud fraction, a key parameter of the phenomenology associated with the thermodynamics of 

the hydrologic cycle. The section starts with a discussion of pertinent satellite observations, 

followed by analysis of results from the models and reanalysis (see Teixeira et al. [2011] for a 

more in-depth discussion).

-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - 

Figure 4.6 shows the vertical distribution of clouds along the GPCI cross section, as inferred 

from cloud occurrence products retrieved by sensors on board the CloudSat and CALIPSO 

satellites during JJA 2006, together with the result from a combination of those two products. 

CloudSat and CALIPSO are members of the NASA's A-Train, a constellation of six satellites 

flying in formation and in close proximity. The differences found between the cloud 

distributions obtained by each satellite are associated with the specific targets the 

corresponding sensors where built to look at. 

CloudSat cloud occurence (%) CALIPSO cloud occurence (%) Combined cloud occurence (%)

 

Figure 4.6 - Vertical cross sections of cloud occurrence along the GPCI transect for June-July-August 2006 from 
CloudSat (left), CALIPSO (center), and a combination of both (right) (see text for details). 

With nearly identical orbits, CloudSat and CALIPSO carry two active sensors designed for the 

mapping of hydrometeors and aerosols, respectively, the Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) (Im et 

al. 2006), and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) (Winker et al., 

2007). Essentially, the lidar detects optically thin cloud layers, but cannot penetrate very deep 

into (dense) cloud tops, while the radar is able to retrieve information from deeper in thick 

hydrometeor layers, but is limited by detection thresholds and contamination from surface 

clutter. These constraints are responsible for some of the features in the CloudSat and 

CALIPSO plots in Fig. 4.6, namely, less cloud occurrence in the ITCZ for CALIPSO, as 

compared with CloudSat, and the “clear” surface layer in CloudSat. Note that CALIPSO’s 

relatively high cloud occurrence in the subtropics (north of 23°N along the transect) is 

somewhat expected, and is an indication that stratocumulus decks form in the region in 

conditions unfavorable to the existence of upper-level optically-thick cloud layers. 

There seemed to be enough reasons to envision the merging of information from CPR and 

CALIOP, especially in face of their virtually simultaneous measurements. The cloud 

occurrences shown in the right plot in Fig. 4.6 were extracted from a dataset obtained from the

onto the radar footprint. These combined products play an important role in climate model 

validation efforts (e.g., Zhang et al. 2010). For GPCI, a more comprehensive view of the 

vertical structure of the cloud systems along the transect seems to emerge with this combined

-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - 

different cloud types and transitions that characterize the GPCI region. Moreover, the value of 

GPCI's relatively straightforward approach in trying to tackle these issues is well patent here, 

as it allows for the simultaneous evaluation of a number of important cloud and convection 

regimes. 

Among the models shown, there is, in general, a qualitatively good representation of the 

evolution of the depth of the cloudy boundary layer going from the stratocumulus regions to 

the deep tropics, with ECMWF, GFDL, and UKMO more realistically getting the expected 

smooth and gradual deepening boundary layer (e.g., Karlsson et al. 2010). There are, however, 

some noteworthy issues including: i) too low stratocumulus clouds (e.g., NCAR); ii) presence 

of distinct cloud layers in the transition areas (e.g., between 14°N and 23°N in BMRC); and iii) 

very small cloud fraction (e.g., JAMSTEC). The differences in the ITCZ are significant, as 

well, with some models showing substantial cloud fraction at all levels in the column (e.g., 

NCAR), in contrast with models with negligible amounts in the lower troposphere, but with 

large values in the upper troposphere (e.g., JAMSTEC); or models with large values in the 

lower troposphere, but with relatively low amounts in the upper troposphere (e.g., Météo-

France). Finally, a quick comparison with the results in the right plot in Fig. 4.6, reveals 

NCAR as the most accurate simulation of the vertical distribution of cloud fraction, even more 

so than ERA-40. 

4.5 Process studies 

Keeping the focus on the climatological characterization of the hydrologic cycle, as inferred 

from cloud and cloud-related parameters associated with the different regimes found along the 

GPCI cross section, a process-oriented study is proposed here to investigate the interplay 

between dynamical and environmental variables which potentially impact cloud formation and 

characteristics in the GPCI region. The main goal is to describe the models’ response to a 

variety of large-scale and surface forcings. Given the fact that the analysis is based on a 

relatively limited time period (JJA 1998 and 2003), the results presented here should be 

regarded as only preliminary. 

In Section 4.5.1, the influence of the (prescribed) SSTs, on the large-scale atmospheric 

circulation, and on a number of parameters, is investigated based on monthly means taken 

along the GPCI section. In Section 4.5.2, the investigation goes a step further and looks at the

-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - 

relation among subsidence, cloud cover, SST, and atmospheric stability obtained directly from 

the available 3-hourly model and reanalysis data. 

4.5.1 Monthly means versus SST 

A relatively straightforward approach was taken to obtain, for the model simulations and 

ECMWF analysis, the relations between SST and, vertical velocity at 700 hPa (w700hPa), total 

cloud cover (TCC), liquid water path (LWP), precipitation (P), outgoing longwave radiation 

(OLR), and net shortwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere (NSRTOA), shown in Fig.

Figure 4.8 - Vertical velocity at 700 hPa (w700hPa), total cloud cover (TCC), liquid water path (LWP), 
precipitation (P), outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), and net shortwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere 
(NSRTOA) along GPCI from models and ECMWF analysis (ECMWFan) composited for the months with the 
coolest (spatially averaged) monthly mean SST (COOL [squares]) and warmest (spatially averaged) monthly 

mean SST (WARM [stars]) among June, July, and August from 1998 and 2003. 

At a first step, the coolest and warmest months, in terms of the transect-averaged SST, were 

identified from the six months that comprise the two JJA seasons in 1998 and 2003 (the 

available periods for GPCI). For the months thus identified, the corresponding monthly means 

for the other parameters were then calculated at a second stage. In the results shown, the 

coolest- and warmest-SST months have been found to be June 1998 and August 2003, 

respectively (June 2003 and August 2003 in the case of the ECMWF analysis, for which only 

- 42 - 



-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - 

2003 data were available). Essentially, all of the datasets have ~ 297 K for the coolest month, 

and ~ 299 K for the warmest month, which implies a ~ 2 K SST departure between the “cool” 

and “warm” fields presented in Fig. 4.8. 

As stated above, the main goal here is to analyze how, in a climatological sense, cloud-related 

parameters change in relation to changes in large-scale dynamical and environmental variables. 

In this particular case, the investigation of changes between cool- and warm-SST months, 

basically follows an approach widely used in climate sensitivity studies, that tries to 

characterize the simulated model response to specific perturbations imposed to the (prescribed) 

SST field. Spatially uniform perturbations of +2 K and -2 K are traditionally used (e.g., Cess et 

al. 1996; Bony et al. 2004), complemented by more complex spatially and time varying SST 

perturbations (e.g., Wyant et al. 2006). From what is said in Section 4.1, the SSTs prescribed in 

the GPCI simulations correspond to analysis, and are thus quite realistic, in general showing, 

for 2003, not just an overall increase, as compared with 1998, but also an accompanying 

decrease in the along-transect gradient in the trades (Fig. 4.1). Recall, though, that there are 

slight dataset and implementation-technique differences among the different simulations used 

here. In the ideal situation all models use the same SSTs, as is done in the traditional approach. 

The fields of vertical velocity at 700 hPa (w700hPa) produced for both “cool” and “warm” 

months are, overall, qualitatively similar, and, as expected, depict the ascending and 

descending branches of the Hadley circulation, with negative values of the pressure velocity in 

the ITCZ (~ 5°N to 11°N) and positive values elsewhere, that peak in the subtropics (32°N to 

35°N). It is between 17°N and 29°N (mostly in the trades) that the different results agree the 

best. In terms of the differences going from the “cool” to the “warm” months, the results show: 

a general intensification (except for the maximum values for NCAR and ECMWF, that have a 

slight decrease) and widening (especially towards the north) of the deep convection area 

associated with the ITCZ; a decrease in subsidence at 17°N; in the trades, and all the way to 

32°N, the datasets do not agree in their response, showing both slight decreases or increases in 

subsidence (except for NCEP, that shows a consistent decrease, and for ECMWFan, that shows 

an overall increase); at 35°N there is, in general, a marked increase in subsidence, the 

exceptions being ECMWFan, that basically doesn't change, and NCAR, that decreases. In fact, 

two mainly distinct behaviours can be found, on one side, NCAR simulates an overall weaker 

Hadley circulation in the warm month, in clear contrast with ECMWFan, that intensifies the 

Hadley circulation in response to the higher SSTs. In conclusion, there, is overall, a noticeable 

- 43 - 



-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - 

response of the large-scale circulation to the change(s) in the prescribed SSTs in all the models 

(and analysis) shown. 

Regarding the cloud cover response, the ITCZ shows a clear overall increase in TCC in all of 

the datasets (except for NCEP). To some extent, this is expected, given the fact that the warmer 

SSTs have been found to favor an increase in the deep convective activity in this area. Note 

that the decrease in the peak absolute value of w700hPa in the ITCZ (8°N) for NCAR is 

associated with a relatively shy increase in TCC, as compared with the responses in the other 

datasets. The response in the ITCZ is in contrast with the situation to the north of 17°N, where 

the models show lower values for the warm-month TCCs versus the cold-month TCCs. Again, 

this is to some extent expected in these regions, and a positive sign (from a climate modelling 

perspective) since warmer SSTs tend to be more favorable to shallow-cumulus clouds and less 

favorable to the formation of extensive stratocumulus cloud decks (at 26°N and 29°N all 

results agree in the TCC decrease). In this regard, and looking closer, a couple of results stand 

out in that they seem less intuitive, namely, the increases in TCC at 32°N and 35°N for NCAR, 

and at 35°N for ECMWFan. In NCAR this is even more striking, since, accompanying the 

increase in SST, there is also a decrease in the intensity of the subtropical subsidence 

(w700hPa). Assuming that the TCC at 29°N and 32°N is essentially associated with low 

boundary layer cloudiness, and taking into account ECMWF and ECMWFan in that area, one 

could argue that the fact that their (spatially-averaged) TCC decreases in the “warmer” SST 

month, even in face of relatively important concomitant increases in the local “warm-month” 

subsidence, are an indication of a cloud response more directly connected to the change in the 

thermodynamic state of the lower troposphere (e.g., its static stability [typically negatively 

correlated with the SST]) than with the change in the large-scale dynamics (at least as 

translated by w700hPa). This is in line with some of the findings by Sandu et al. (2010). 

In terms of the LWP variable, ECMWFan, MétéoFrance, and ECMWF, show a behaviour 

similar to that of their respective TCC parameter. The responses in TCC and LWP aren’t as 

clear for NCAR, with at least five locations along the transect showing LWP and TCC with 

opposing responses. Overall, it seems as if the previously described weakening of the Hadley 

circulation in NCAR entails lower values of simulated LWP in the GPCI region. There is, 

however, some interesting regional variation in NCAR's behaviour, especially in the distinct 

decreases in LWP between -1°N and 11°N (ITCZ included), in clear contrast with the average 

increase between 32°N and 35°N (well in the subtropical stratocumulus area) where, as stated 

above, TCC also increases. Again, NCAR seems to respond with increased cloud formation 

- 44 - 



-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - 

(TCC and LWP) in the stratocumulus area, even under large-scale dynamic and environmental 

conditions traditionally agreed as less favorable to extensive low boundary-layer cloudiness (as 

discussed in the previous paragraph). The available NCEP LWP had bad-data, and or units 

problems and was not included in the plot. 

The increase in precipitation (P) in response to warmer SSTs is noticeable, and, particularly for 

the ITCZ, shows a clear dependence with the concomitant intensification (and widening) of the 

deep convection region discussed above (for w700hPa). Quantitatively, the models show some 

interesting nuances in the ITCZ, with ECMWF being clearly overactive in its precipitation 

response, as compared with its response in the other parameters discussed. This is in contrast 

with the case of MétéoFrance, that shows a weaker intensification in precipitation, while being 

relatively more responsive in the increases in TCC and LWP, and intensification of |w700hPa|. 

Note that NCAR actually shows a decrease in the peak precipitation intensity in the ITCZ, at 

8°N, while presenting at 11°N a significant increase in the precipitation rate in the warm month 

(~ 4 times higher) – a very clear response to the transition in the local dynamics regime, that 

goes from downward motion (~ 0.02 Pas-1) in the “cooler” regime, to upward motion (~ -0.02 

Pas-1) in the “warmer” regime. Finally, to the north of the ITCZ, there is an increase in 

precipitation up to 20°N in all datasets, with basically unchanged precipitation rates to the 

north of 23°N, except for NCEP, that shows more precipitation at 26°N and 29°N, with the 

value at 26°N being almost as high as the values found in the deep convection area (e.g., at 

11°N), and, again, probably in association with a relatively important decrease in the intensity 

of the subsidence at 26°N (~ 0 Pas-1 in the monthly mean response for the warm SSTs). 

In the ITCZ (and generally south of 17°N) most results show the expected link between OLR 

and variables such as TCC, LWP, and precipitation, that is, coherent simulated 

increases/decreases in those three variables, are associated with decreases/increases in the 

corresponding response of the OLR parameter to the warmer SSTs. This is, however, not the 

case for NCEP, that shows relatively important increases in OLR between 8°N and 17°N, 

which is clearly more in line with the remarkable decrease in TCC, than with the increase in 

precipitation in that area (recall that NCEP LWP data wasn't available). In the shallow cumulus 

and stratocumulus areas (north of 17°N), however, NCEP's OLR (overall decrease) appears to 

be more sensitive to the precipitation changes (increase) than with the TCC changes (decrease) 

shown in response to the higher SSTs. The other datasets show the expected increase in OLR 

in response to the overall decrease in TCC (and LWP) to the north of 17°N (expect for 

ECMWFan, that shows no apparent change in OLR between the warm and the cool months to 

- 45 - 



-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - 

the north of 23°N, in line with the shy response in its LWP). Finally, looking at 32°N and 

35°N, NCAR's increase in OLR seems counterintuitive, given the increases in TCC and LWP, 

and raises a question about how high above the surface the associated cloudiness may have 

been simulated, since the lowest the cloudiness the lowest its expected impact on the OLR. The 

available ECMWF OLR had bad-data, and or units problems and was not included in the plot. 

In the remaining set of results, there is, overall, the expected link between NSRTOA, TCC, and 

LWP. This is especially true for LWP, whose local response (increases, or decreases) to the 

warmer SSTs correlates well with the corresponding NSRTOA response (decreases, or 

increases, respectively). One noteworthy departure from this close link is seen at 29°N, for 

both NCAR and ECMWFan, that show decreases in NSRTOA, but also in both, TCC and 

LWP, in their simulated responses to +2 K SSTs. The available ECMWF NSRTOA had bad-

data, and or units problems and was not included in the plot. 

In summary, one main finding of the analysis presented above, is the fact that the general 

response to the increase in SST is not always coherent among the different variables, 

particularly at the local level at specific locations along the GPCI transect. This points out to 

the need to better constrain the simulated behaviour of important cloud-related variables, 

including those crucial for the evaluation of the cloud radiative forcing. Any improvements in 

this area would contribute to increase our understanding of the impacts and feedbacks of 

clouds in the hydrologic cycle, and ultimately of their key role in the climate system. Another 

important aspect of this study was the ability to, to some extent, qualitatively evaluate the 

relative impact of the increase in SST as compared to that of the (concomitant) changes in the 

large-scale dynamics (w700hPa), in the response of the cloud variables to the (+2 K) SST 

perturbation. A more complete analysis of these dependencies is beyond the scope of this 

section. Bony et al. 2004, and Wyant et al. 2006 offer further insight on this topic. Finally, it 

should be added that, although the vertical velocity field (e.g., w700hPa) can be seen as a 

meaningful proxy of the large-scale (sub)tropical circulation, and knowing its key role in the 

phenomenology of the difference tropical and subtropical cloud regimes, it is certainly not the 

only important large-scale factor that can impact the behaviour of cloud variables, others 

being, for instance, mid-tropospheric dry intrusions, and temperature lapse rate modifications. 

4.5.2 Large-scale forcings 

In this section the focus is more specifically on low cloud cover (LCC, obtained for each point 

in the GPCI transect simply from the maximum value of cloud fraction simulated in the layer 

- 46 - 



-    Description of the climatology in the GPCI simulations    - 

between the surface and 680 hPa). The investigation tries to understand to what extent the 

interplay between subsidence and SST, and alternatively, subsidence and low tropospheric 

stability (LTS, calculated at each location in the GPCI cross section taking the difference 

between the potential temperature at 700 hPa and the SST), relates to the model simulated low 

cloud cover in the segment of the GPCI transect between 14°N and 35°N (shallow cumulus 

and stratocumulus regions). The analysis is based solely on data for JJA 1998. Again, although 

one single season and year cannot offer statistically significant conclusions, it is worthwhile to 

explore the high temporal resolution (3-hourly) model output. 

Figure 4.9 is based on Fig. 16 in Teixeira et al. (2011), but shows, in addition to low cloud 

cover as a function of SST and subsidence, low cloud cover as a function of LTS and 

subsidence, together with the joint probability density functions (jPDFs) for SST versus 

subsidence, and LTS versus subsidence. At least as a first approximation, the left and right 

ends of the SST axis in Fig. 4.9 can be seen as the northern and southern ends of the segment 

of the GPCI transect between the shallow cumulus and the stratocumulus, respectively (for the 

LTS it would be the other way around, although, most probably, to a lesser degree). 

The jPDFs (in numbered contour lines) show, for all the results, the most representative bins in 

the 0 to 0.05 Pas-1 subsidence range, confirming that the region between 14°N and 35°N is 

dominated by large-scale downward motion. For the binning used, the peak values in the 

jPDFs seem more dispersed in the SST plots than in the LTS plots. Especially for the models 

shown (NCAR and UKMO), the largest values of subsidence are found in association with the 

coldest SSTs. 

The value of the mean LCC for each bin in the jPDFs of subsidence versus SST, and 

subsidence versus LTS, is given by the color (%) scale. Although it is clear in all results that 

the colder SSTs (below ~ 295 K) are associated with the highest LCCs  (above ~ 70 %), it 

seems difficult to find any obvious relation among the three parameters in any of the results 

shown. The NCAR results, show a more complex dependency of LCC on SST (and LTS), with 

a decrease in LCC for the coldest (highest) waters (LTS). Note, as well, that the peak LCC in 

NCAR is found for negative subsidence values (though in relatively rare events). Particularly 

for positive subsidence and in the vicinity of the most representative bins in the LTS plots (0 to 

0.05 Pas-1 [subsidence] and 15 K to 17 K [LTS] for NCAR and UKMO, and 0 to 0.05 Pas-1 and 

19 K to 21 K for ERA-40), these results do not show any specific dependency of LCC on the 

large-scale dynamics (vertical velocity at 700 hPa [mb]).

More comprehensive investigation on the interplay between cloud properties and measures of 

vertical stability has shown a significant relation between cloud cover and vertical stability in 

the cloudy boundary layer (e.g., Klein and Hartmann 1993; Wood and Bretherton 2006).

5 Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition 

Following a more traditional look at seasonal means of cloud-related parameters, presented in 

Chapter 4 to characterize the mean thermodynamic structure in weather and climate prediction 

models, the study will now turn to a more detailed analysis of the recurring transition in 

convective regime associated with the Hadley circulation, a prominent feature of the eastern 

boundaries of the (sub)tropical oceans (e.g., Sandu et al. 2010), discussed above specifically 

for the GPCI region. 

The different cloud regimes associated with the large-scale overturning circulation (e.g., 

boundary layer clouds, deep convection towers, and the transitions between them) exert an 

important impact on the (sub)tropical atmospheric circulation, and thus on the climate system 

as a whole (e.g., Philander et al. 1996; Ma et al. 1996; Larson et al. 1999). One important 

aspect of these cloud systems is the relative contrast of their cloud radiative forcing (CRF) 

(e.g., Ramanathan et al. 1989; Hartmann et al. 1992) and feedbacks (e.g., Larson et al. 1999; 

Lindzen et al. 2001), two factors that make their relative spatiotemporal partitioning an 

important subject in climate change investigation. Climate change sensitivity experiments (e.g., 

doubling CO2), show striking differences in the climate models' response in (low) boundary 

layer clouds, in many cases resulting in diverging cloud-climate feedbacks (e.g., Bony et al. 

2004, Bony et al. 2006; Bony and Dufresne 2005; Wyant et al. 2006; Stephens 2005). In 

particular, it has been shown that the low-level cloudiness found in regions of moderate 

subsidence (e.g., trade-wind ShCu [shallow cumulus]) strongly influence modelled responses 

of CRF to prescribed ocean surface warming, mostly owing to their ubiquitous nature, and, 

hence, higher statistical weight (e.g., Bony et al. 2004). In this context, it can easily be argued 

that any changes in the (sub)tropical transitions between Sc (stratocumulus) and ShCu would 

have an impact on the tropical radiation budget, and therefore should be an important part of 

the investigation of cloud–climate feedbacks. 

In the following sections, cloud data from model simulations, atmospheric reanalysis, and 

satellite observations are used in the GPCI framework to gain insight into the question of the 

transition in (sub)tropical cloud regimes. This is done by describing the observations, and 

evaluating and intercomparing the different models in view of their specific cloud and 

boundary-layer parameterizations. Several techniques to detect the transitions, and or 

summarize their main seasonal features, are proposed in Section 5.1. In Section 5.2, after the 

- 49 - 



-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - 

presentation of results from a preliminary spectral analysis of the seasonal record of spatial 

shifts in the location of sharp transitions in total cloud cover (TCC), a novel approach to 

clustering of spatial patterns is introduced, and subsequently applied to TCC along the GPCI 

transect, with the final goal to indentify main spatiotemporal features of the seasonal tropical 

and subtropical TCC, and compare their respective environmental conditions. 

The analysis presented in Sections 5.1.1, 5.1.2, and 5.1.3, is, in part, based on the results 

published in Teixeira et al. (2011). Section 5.1.4 discusses results published in Karlsson et al. 

(2010). The two publications were co-authored by the author of this thesis. 

5.1 Representation of cloud transition 

The brief sequence of results presented below is intended to characterize the spatiotemporal 

nature of the subtropical Sc-to-ShCu transitions, and how their presence and behaviour can be 

detected, or inferred, in different ways, depending on which aspect of its phenomenology one 

focuses on. Several approaches are then used to reveal different expressions of this transition, 

as seen in models and observations: from its impact on traditional seasonal climatologies of 

cloud cover (Section 5.1.1); to how it affects the summertime distribution of cloud cover 

values in different locations (Section 5.1.2); and how abrupt these transitions may actually be, 

as seen in high temporal resolution data (Section 5.1.3); or, more specifically looking at low 

boundary layer clouds, how their mean cloud-top height evolves along the GPCI transect 

(Section 5.1.4). 

5.1.1 Seasonal mean cloud cover 

As a starting point of the analysis of the cloud regime transitions, done in the next sections 

resorting to TCC information, Fig. 5.1 shows the individual model mean TCC behind the 

statistics presented in Fig. 4.2b (namely, model ensemble mean, ensemble mean plus and 

minus one standard deviation, and maximum and minimum values [range] at each location 

along the GPCI section). 

The choice of TCC for this investigation, is partly based on the fact that the analysis is 

performed along the whole length of the GPCI transect, therefore encompassing the different 

cloud regimes (Sc to the north, ShCu in the transition areas, and deep convection towers in the 

inter-tropical convergence zone [ITCZ] ). A corresponding study, using low cloud cover (LCC) 

instead, is not included here, owing to the lack of LCC output in the GPCI protocol (a simple 

- 50 - 



-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - 

definition of LCC was used for the results presented in Fig. 4.9, knowing, though, that it may 

not be exactly the one in use in the different models). Note that, by looking at the features in 

the TCC field alone, one cannot directly infer on the nature of the associated convection 

regimes; it is only from the knowledge gained in the preceding chapters, that a close link 

between TCC and convection regimes can be reported. In this regard recall, for instance, the 

seasonal means of the vertical distribution of cloud fraction along GPCI presented in Fig. 4.7. 

Note that these results indicated that in the northern portion of the cross section, the TCC 

reported is probably very often mostly coming from the low cloudiness  simulated  during the 

June-July-August (JJA) 1998 season.

Figure 5.1 - June-July-August (JJA) 1998 mean total cloud cover along GPCI from each one of the participating 
models, ERA-40 reanalysis, and ISCCP observations. 

It was stressed in Teixeira et al. (2011) that the large degree of scatter among the models’ mean 

TCC is a clear indication of the serious problems current weather and climate prediction 

models have simulating clouds. Going a step further in that discussion, the question is now on 

whether the way in which the transitions between the different cloud regimes happen in the 

models contributes to the perceived model (and reanalysis) deficiencies. Can it (at least partly) 

explain the differences in TCC between NCAR and ERA-40 in the 17°N to 35°N portion of the 

transect (where NCAR is consistently above ERA-40)? How do the cloud transitions in Météo-

France and UKMO compare to the ones in ISCCP between 20°N and 32°N (where the three 

datasets show relatively small TCC departures)? 

5.1.2 Histograms 

Although an important tool for a quick evaluation of first-order differences among 

corresponding results from different model simulations, seasonal mean diagnostics (e.g., the 

- 51 - 



-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - 

TCC mean in Fig. 5.1), fall short of providing higher-order information such as temporal 

variability, which, usually, is valuable in further sorting out the relative performance of the 

models. In this section, TCC is analyzed from the perspective of its probability density 

function (PDF), taken individually at each location along the GPCI transect with the goal to 

further explain the nature of the cloud regime transition in the region, namely: 1) how is it 

being reproduced in the models; and 2) what do observations (e.g., ISCCP) show in this 

respect. 

In Fig. 5.2, PDFs of TCC along the GPCI transect, obtained from 3-hourly data from JJA 1998, 

are presented, for models, reanalysis, and ISCCP observations.

-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - 

The clear differences among these results, once again, confirm the variety of model behaviours 

in what concerns the simulation of clouds. Note that important differences in the TCC 

distributions can be found even in locations where models do show practically the same mean 

TCC (e.g., ECMWF, GFDL, and UKMO at 20°N [typical location for Sc-to-ShCu transitions] 

where all show ~ 60 % TCC). In more detail, and looking separately at each one of the three 

main cloud regime domains along the GPCI cross section, the situation is, for the Sc domain 

(26°N to 35°N): i) ISCCP, NCAR, and UKMO do not have any counts in the lowest TCC bins 

(TCC &amp;lt;30 %); ii) GFDL and JAMSTEC preferably fall in the extreme TCC bins (TCC &amp;lt;10 % 

and TCC &gt; 95 %); while iii) ECMWF, ETH/MPI, ERA-40, and Météo-France fall somewhere 

in between those two situations. In the ShCu domain (14°N to 26°N): i) ECMWF, JAMSTEC, 

Météo-France, NCAR, ERA-40, and ISCCP show relatively smooth transitions, covering the 

bins between ~ 20 % and 90 % TCC; ii) overall, the TCC distributions are wider in ISCCP, 

ERA-40, ECMWF, and Météo-France, and relatively narrower for JAMSTEC, and 

(particularly) NCAR; iii) in contrast, the transitions in UKMO, ETH/MPI, and (particularly) 

GFDL are quite abrupt. Finally, in the ITCZ domain (5°N to 11°N): i) often high values of 

TCC (&gt; 70 %) characterize the distributions for GFDL, NCAR, and Météo-France; ii) 

ECMWF, ETH/MPI, ERA-40, and ISCCP also show an important peak in the highest TCC 

bins, but have a wider spread in the overall distribution; iii) on the other hand, UKMO has a 

preference for lower TCC bins (TCC &amp;lt;50 %), and shows a considerable spread in the deep 

convection TCC values; iv) JAMSTEC stands out as having its TCC distributed mostly 

between 20 % and 40 % TCC. In summary, two very distinct Sc-to-ShCu transitions can be 

identified in these TCC results, namely, a relatively smooth southward evolution (e.g., NCAR) 

and a more abrupt one with a bimodal character (e.g., UKMO). 

Assuming that the main reason behind the differences in the TCC transition among the model 

results is mostly related to the way clouds are parameterized, a quick review of two distinct 

cloud parameterizations used in two of the models shown seems appropriate. In the case of the 

NCAR model, it could be argued that, to its smooth transition in the TCC evolution in the 

subtropics contributes the fact that its subtropical boundary layer cloudiness is, partly, 

parameterized in tight connection with the lower tropospheric stability (LTS, defined as the 

difference between the potential temperatures at 700 hPa and at the surface) – an empirical 

relation (e.g., Slingo 1980; Klein and Hartmann 1993) that has been adapted and used in 

climate modelling (e.g., Slingo 1987; Rasch and Kristjánsson 1998), but that, apparently, 

performs better at describing this link between low clouds and LTS, on larger spatiotemporal 

- 53 - 



-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - 

scales (e.g., Kawai and Teixeira 2010). Recall that the results shown above, were obtained 

from the 3-hourly (and grid box) model output. That said, it is probable that NCAR is partly 

adjusting to the LTSs found along the GPCI transect (decreasing southward with increasing 

SSTs) by diagnosing corresponding climatological values of cloud cover, which then 

potentially leads to the smooth transition in TCC (the tight adjustment of [low] cloud cover to 

LTS may also be a reason for the relatively narrow seasonal TCC PDF distributions described 

above in the transition domain). It should be noted, however, that this parameterization may 

not always have the final word on the boundary layer cloud determination, and that, because 

TCC reported by models generally results from the application of cloud overlap assumptions of 

some sort, to the vertically distributed cloud fraction (including the boundary layer 

contributions), the overall impact of this parameterization on the final values of TCC cannot be 

fully understood from the available model output. 

In the case of the UKMO model, the cloudy boundary layer parameterization is known to have 

been developed with the idea of the existence of a finite number of spatially separated 

subtropical physical regimes, such as those associated with stratocumulus, cumulus, and the 

transitions from cumulus to stratocumulus (e.g., Lock et al. 2000). This kind of simplification 

may be responsible for the bimodal nature of the TCC distribution along GPCI in the UKMO 

and (partly) in the GFDL results. 

Going back to what ISCCP shows, although a final evaluation of the models in terms of these 

boundary layer cloud transitions would have to come from the study of a larger geographical 

area, and a longer time period, the preliminary conclusion is that none of these two very 

different model behaviours and parameterization approaches reproduces well the observed 

pattern in TCC distribution along the GPCI cross section for the JJA 1998 season. 

5.1.3 Sharp gradients 

The results presented in the two preceding sections showed well that the evolution of cloud 

cover along the GPCI transect is subject to changes that have a signature, not only in the mean 

values, but also in the nature of the local distributions of total cloud cover (TCC) – both shown 

to be quite different among the various datasets. Although undeniably useful for the study of 

the transitions in cloud regime, these two views of the TCC field are static by definition, and 

thus, cannot provide information on how the cloud cover values (coherently) change in time 

along the cross section during the season. Here, the investigation is taken to a new level 

resorting to the available high temporal resolution model output and observational data, so as 

- 54 - 



-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - 

to produce estimates of how often the transitions are characterized by more or less abrupt 

discontinuities in the TCC field (known to be a manifestation of the subtropical maritime Sc-

to-ShCu transitions). 

The methodology proposed for the new kind of averaging can be divided into two main steps: 

(i) starting at the northernmost point (35°N, in the Sc region) and progressing southward along 

the cross section, determination of the location of the first significant decrease in TCC (e.g., 

above a given threshold of 30 % TCC); (ii) calculation of the average TCC to the northeast 

(NE) and southwest (SW) of the location determined in (i). This is performed for each one of 

the TCC records available 3-hourly. Note that, in step (ii), it is assumed that the TCC field is 

close to spatially uniform in the transect domains to the north and to the south of the transition 

location. Finally, the values for the seasonal mean TCC of the abrupt transition are obtained for 

the extreme north and south locations in the transect, respectively, from the means of all the 

NE and SW TCC averages; and for the mean location of the transition, as the mean of all the 

locations found in the 3-hourly data. Histograms of the transition location are computed as 

well. Bear in mind that, because the TCC field may actually not be uniform, the averaging of 

the TCC over the NE and SW domains mentioned above [step (ii)] can potentially result in a 

TCC difference between these domains lower than the threshold used to identify the abrupt 

decrease in TCC (this may even result in a SW TCC average higher than the one to the NE). 

An updated version of this methodology, developed to overcome this issue, is presented later in 

section 6.3.3.1. 

Figure 5.3 presents, for ERA-40 and ISCCP, a summary of the main features associated with 

the occurrence of abrupt decreases in TCC along the GPCI transect, obtained by applying the 

methodology described in the previous paragraph to data for JJA 1998. Both ERA-40 and 

ISCCP show an important jump in TCC (left plot). These results show that this approach was 

able to capture discontinuities in the TCC field, whose magnitude and prevalence can, in part, 

be responsible for the TCC features that are typically seen in the more traditional seasonal 

means of TCC along the GPCI transect (note the high seasonal occurrence [occ] in both ERA-

40 and ISCCP, shown in the plot to the right [location histograms]). It should be said that these 

results were practically unchanged using different values for the TCC threshold (e.g., 20% or 

30% TCC), an indication of the robustness of the methodology. Recall, however, that the TCC 

values reported by the models may not (always) correspond to (low) boundary layer cloud 

cover (typically the cloudiness more directly subject to this kind of transitions), but can also (or 

exclusively) include information on high- and mid-level cloud cover. 

- 55 - 



-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - 

Important departures between ERA-40 and ISCCP are highlighted in the context of this kind of 

analysis. In the left plot in Fig. 5.3, the two datasets differ, not only in the mean strength of the 

TCC gradients (~ 15 % and ~ 40 %, respectively for ERA-40 and ISCCP), but also in the mean 

TCC to the NE and SW of the abrupt decreases in TCC (ISCCP is ~ 10 % above ERA-40 to 

the NE, and ~ 15 % lower to the SW), and in the mean location of the gradients (~ 20°N in 

ISCCP and ~ 26°N in ERA-40). In what concerns the histograms of the location of the sharp 

gradients (right plot), it can be seen that the transition from Sc to ShCu occurs, in ERA-40, 

much more to the north (with the peak at 35°N, the northernmost point in the transect) than in 

ISCCP (with the peak at 23°N). In a lagrangian perspective this would mean that the break-up 

of the Sc decks into ShCu happens too early in ERA-40, as compared to ISCCP, and could be 

an additional reason for the negative cloud bias (ERA-40 vs. ISCCP) found in the subtropics – 

apart from the overall lower TCC values in the Sc areas shown in Fig. 5.2, and described in the 

previous chapter (Fig. 4.2b).

Figure 5.3 - June-July-August (JJA) 1998 ISCCP and ERA-40 cloud cover statistics obtained from a methodology 
based on the identification of large gradients of total cloud cover (tcc drop &gt; 30 %) along the GPCI transect (see 
text for details): (left) seasonal mean values, and (right) histograms of the locations of the abrupt changes in total 

cloud cover (occ stands for occurrence [in percent]). 

In Fig. 5.4, the results presented for (some of) the participating models show a diversity of 

behaviours in the sharp TCC transitions in all of the main features under investigation. 

Generally speaking: 1) the mean TCC decrease, as shown in these plots, is found to be between 

~ 45 %, in the UKMO simulations, and ~ 15 % for Météo-France (for ISCCP it is ~ 40 % [Fig. 

5.3]); 2) the seasonal frequency of occurrence (occ, in the plots) is between 86.7 %, for NCAR, 

and ~ 100 % in the other models; 3) the variability in the TCC values to the NE and SW of the 

mean gradient locations is large, and patent in the contrast between BMRC and ECMWF (the 

NE TCC in BMRC is about the same as the SW TCC in ECMWF [~ 55 % TCC]); and 4) the 

different histograms show one, two, or even three relatively well defined peaks.

-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - 

In more detail, it is worth noting that the overall good agreement between the location 

histograms for GFDL (Fig. 5.4), and ISCCP (Fig. 5.3), especially in what concerns the location 

of the main peak (23°N), happens in concomitance with two substantially different histograms 

of TCC along the transect (Fig. 5.2). To some degree, this is also the situation for ECMWF and 

ETH/MPI (with similar location histograms with one central peak between 26°N and 29°N, but 

different TCC histograms). The NCAR model clearly stands out from all the other models in 

the sense that the main peaks in its location histogram are found in the ITCZ area, at 5°N and 

8°N, where the vast majority of sharp-gradient events happen. This is more easily understood 

in connection with the result shown in Fig. 5.2 (histograms of TCC along the transect), where 

it is apparent that the NCAR TCC only very gradually decreases from the Sc, in the northern 

portion of the transect, to the ShCu, and all the way to 14°N (recall NCAR’s narrow TCC 

PDFs along the trades), from where it increases towards the ITCZ. This leaves the occurrence 

of abrupt decreases in TCC mostly to the area south of the deep convection region. Note that 

using LCC would probably eliminate the high peaks in the location histograms to the south of 

the ITCZ, and would probably (further) lower the absolute number of these events along the 

cross section. Again, this is partly a consequence of the way subtropical boundary layer clouds 

are parameterized in the NCAR model (see the discussion in Section 5.1.2). 

The complementariness of the different techniques proposed for the investigation of cloud 

regime transitions along the GPCI transect is well patent – none of them can independently 

fully describe these transitions. In the next section, yet another perspective on the cloud 

transitions is presented, with the focus more specifically on changes in the low-cloud fields. 

5.1.4 Cloud-top height 

As qualitatively discussed in previous sections (e.g., Sections 4.2 to 4.4), the evolution of the 

cloud regimes along the GPCI cross section happens in association with a deepening of the 

maritime boundary layer from the Sc, to the north of the transect, to the ShCu, in the trades, 

and all the way to the vicinity of the deep convection area (ITCZ). Here a more quantitative 

analysis of the evolution of the boundary layer is presented. It relies on the assumption that the 

low clouds in the region are mostly confined to the boundary layer (particularly in the Sc 

regimes), and resorts to cloud top height (CTH) information to produce a climatological 

estimate of boundary layer depth, for observations and models along the GPCI transect. The 

CTH climatology constitutes an important model evaluation tool, that can provide insight on 

- 58 - 



-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - 

how well the models treat the processes responsible for the maintenance of the cloudy 

boundary layer. 

The results presented below are based on the findings reported in Karlsson et al. (2010), a 

paper co-authored by the author of this thesis. 

On the observational side, the study is based on the level-2 wind-corrected CTH product 

obtained from the retrievals by the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) on the Terra 

satellite (Moroney et al. 2002; Davies et al. 2007). Terra is on a sun-synchronous polar-orbit 

and crosses the Equator at ~ 1030 local solar time (descending node). Operationally, MISR 

uses nine cameras at different angles to detect CTH reflectivity, that is then used in stereo-

matching algorithms (Muller et al. 2002), and subsequently subject to geometrical adjustments 

to infer cloud motion and CTH (Zong et al. 2002). The CTH product used offers a horizontal 

resolution of 1 × 1 km2, and a nominal accuracy of 6560 m (6300 for low-level clouds [Naud et 

al. 2004; Garay et al. 2008]). MISR CTHs have been reported to be accurate in the Sc and 

ShCu areas (Garay et al. 2008; Genkova et al. 2007). For this study, CTHs below 3000 m were 

accrued during JJA 2003, for each one of the 13 locations along the GPCI section (in 3° x 4° 

latitude, longitude domains). The spatial average of the CTHs for each domain was then 

converted to cloud-top pressure using geopotential and temperature data from atmospheric 

reanalysis. 

For the model simulations (and ECMWF analysis) the low clouds’ cloud-top pressure was 

obtained for each location in the cross section from the vertically distributed cloud fraction for 

the model levels &gt; 700 hPa (below ~3000 m), provided that no clouds were reported above 700 

hPa, and assuming the low clouds to be arranged in maximum overlap. Clouds with cloud 

condensate below 0.01 g kg-1 were disregarded, assuming that they would not be detected by 

the satellite instrument (other values for this threshold were tried). The final low-clouds’ cloud-

top pressure was then obtained from the weighted average of the half pressures above the 

model levels with (detectable) cloud fraction (the respective cloud tops are assumed to be 

located above the actual level where the cloud fraction is reported by the model), weighted by 

the respective amount of cloud fraction that would be seen from above in the case of a 

maximum cloud overlap. 

In Fig. 5.5, the JJA 2003 CTH results along the GPCI transect are summarized for the models, 

ECMWF analysis, and MISR. In terms of the seasonal means (in plots a and b), there is an 

overall good agreement between the ECMWF analysis and the model ensemble. Basically, 

both show an increase in CTH along the entire transect from a value of ~ 950 hPa at 35°N to ~ 

- 59 - 



-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - 

875 hPa at 28°N, and a maximum of ~ 825 hPa at 5°N. MISR also shows an increase in CTH 

between 35°N (~ 925 hPa) and 20°N (~ 825 hPa), but has lower mean CTH to the south of 

20°N, and gets closer to the simulated CTH between 17°N and 11°N (~ 875 hPa at 11°N), 

staying below the models, and analysis, in the deep convection area and south of it. MISR's 

much higher spatial resolution permits the detection of relatively fine spatial detail in the cloud 

scenes. It is thus speculated that the decreased CTH, south of 20°N (transition to the trades and 

ITCZ), is probably related with the detection of small cumuli that stay below the subsidence 

inversion (e.g., Genkova et al. 2007; Zhao and Di Girolamo 2007), a situation that may be 

associated with the decoupling between the (ocean) surface and the top of the maritime 

boundary layer, by an intermediate weakly-stable layer. Figure 5.5c shows only relatively 

small departures in CTH variability between MISR and the models (MISR's CTH variability is 

above [below] that from the models, and analysis, to the north [south] of 23°N [20°N]). The 

sharp decrease in MISR's variability, going from 23°N to 20°N, possibly indicates the area 

where the trasition from Sc to ShCu is more frequent (recall that ISCCP has at 23°N the 

maximum peak in its histogram of the location of abrupt decreases in total cloud cover [Fig. 

5.3, for JJA 1998]). 

 

Figure 5.5 - Boundary layer height estimate based on the pressure at the top of low clouds, obtained along the 
GPCI transect for June-July-August 2003, for models, ECMWF analysis [dashed line], and MISR observations 

[solid black line]. The solid dark-gray line represents the median of the model ensemble, the light-gray envelope 
represents the interquartile model range, and the dark-gray envelope represents the range of model values: (a) 

mean values, (b) mean values for the models individually [gray lines], and (c) temporal variability (one standard 
deviation). (Figure taken from Karlsson et al. 2010). 

- 60 - 



-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - 

Karlsson et al. (2010) show, in addition to CTH, results from an alternative technique to 

determine the top of the maritime boundary layer (BLT) and estimate its depth, “based on the 

height of the maximum vertical RH [relative humidity] gradient with respect to pressure.” It 

was applied to humidity data from models, analysis, and satellite observations. Although 

equally promising for BLT investigation, a discussion of that technique, and corresponding 

results, is left to Section 6.3.1 (Relative humidity as a proxy for boundary layer depth), and 

Section 6.3.2 (A new scheme to determine the BLT), where an updated version of the 

methodology is introduced. 

5.2 Refined analysis 

To close the chapter, results from a more in-depth investigation of some of the aspects of the 

cloud regime transitions discussed above, are presented in the next couple of sections. Firstly, 

in Section 5.2.1 (Modes of temporal variability) the study tries to refine the characterization of 

abrupt changes in TCC done in Section 5.1.3 (Sharp gradients), and performs a spectral 

analysis of the corresponding 3-hourly record, with the goal to understand the dynamics of the 

TCC transition in terms of the variability of its location. This is presented to complement the 

static view offered by the location histograms (Figs. 5.3 and 5.4). Section 5.2.1 ends with 

proposals for future work, and suggestions on how to extend the analysis to other key 

parameters. Finally, Section 5.2.2 (Environmental conditions associated with main seasonal 

TCC fields) tries to go beyond the all-encompassing seasonal mean view of the TCC field 

presented in Section 5.1.1 (Seasonal mean cloud cover), and resorts to high temporal resolution 

(3-hourly) TCC data for the identification of spatiotemporal patterns corresponding to 

preferred modes of behaviour of the cloud regime transitions that occur along the GPCI cross 

section. This is done using a newly developed clustering technique, whose TCC results are 

then used to composite other cloud-related variables, to infer potential impacts of their 

interplay on the regime transitions that occur in the region. 

5.2.1 Modes of temporal variability 

The first step to prepare the data for the spectral analysis of the spatial variability of the sharp 

gradients in TCC (see Section 5.1.3 for details on how to detect these abrupt changes in TCC 

along the GPCI transect) was the subtraction, from the corresponding 3-hourly record, of the 

value of their seasonal mean location (all given in latitude along the cross section). The result 

is a record of location anomalies that allows for a relatively straightforward intercomparison 

- 61 - 



-    Cloud-based analysis of convective regime transition    - 

among different datasets. Figure 5.6 shows, for JJA 1998, the seasonal anomaly record for a 

few of the models, ERA-40 reanalysis, and ISCCP observations, and offers a quick view of the 

dynamics of the TCC transition in terms of the shifts in its location in complement of the 

information in the respective location histograms (Figs. 5.3 and 5.4). Note that in the abscissa 

axis (time) the minor ticks correspond to days (8 UTCs, 3-hourly), and the labels (located at 

the beginning of each week during the season) indicate the number of 3-hourly records up to 

that point in time. Also, keep in mind that a positive (negative) latitudinal displacement 

indicates a position along the transect to the north (south) of the seasonal mean location. 

There are some noteworthy differences among the datasets shown in Fig. 5.6. For instance: in 

ISCCP, the latitudinal displacements are, overall, relatively large (between +16° and -16°), and 

the sharp decreases in TCC tend to stay for longer periods to the north of the mean location, a 

situation that changes dramatically in the last two weeks of August, when these consistently 

tend to stay to the south of the mean location; ERA-40 shows, overall, a highly changeable 

location of the sharp gradients, with displacements confined between +8° and -24°; in the 

second half of the season there is, in the reanalysis, a tendency of the sharp gradients to stay for 

longer periods in a given location (either to the north or to the south of the mean location); for 

NCAR, the displacements oscillate between -8° and +20°, and show a noticeable change in the 

last 4 weeks of the season, with the sharp gradients preferably staying to the north of the 

seasonal mean location (especially in the last week of August), probably a result of earlier (in a 

lagrangian sense) Sc-to-ShCu transitions, owing to the warming SSTs (lower LTS) 

experienced in the northern part of the transect towards the end of the JJA 1998 season (see the 

discussions in Sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.3); ETH/MPI shows the smallest latitudinal 

displacements (basically between +8° and -8°), and is the dataset whose sharp gradients 

happen continuously for longer periods in any of the sides of the mean location (e.g., a positive 

displacement for the whole fifth week of JJA); finally, in UKMO, the main feature seems to be 

the increase in the variability of the location of the sharp gradients towards the end of the 

season.

Figure 5.7 presents the power spectra corresponding to the temporal series shown in Fig. 5.6, 

and, additionally, the power spectrum for Météo-France (whose temporal series is not shown in 

Fig. 5.6). It is apparent that there are no outstanding peaks in any of the plots. Nevertheless, 

relatively speaking, they show, overall, the expected behaviour when compared against the 

respective anomaly records analyzed above, e.g., ISCCP is generally slower (higher power in 

the lower frequencies) than UKMO or ERA-40, Météo-France is similar to ISCCP, and 

ETH/MPI has more power in the lowest frequencies than UKMO. In more detail, there is a 

relatively well define power peak in UKMO around a period of 12.5 days (10-2 in the 

frequency axis), while, for ERA-40, the most prominent peak is located around 6.25 days. 

It would be interesting to extend this analysis to other cloud-related parameters of interest for 

the topic of the subtropical cloud regime transitions. Taking advantage of the 3-hourly model 

and reanalysis data, variables such as LTS, SST, and free tropospheric humidity could be 

spatially averaged in a domain upwind of the mean location of the sharp gradients in TCC (or 

LCC), and the record of their anomaly relative to the respective seasonal means be subject to 

the same kind of treatment proposed above (Figs. 5.6 and 5.7). Relevant questions could then 

be asked, for instance, about the correlations between each one of those anomaly records and 

the anomaly of the location of the sharp gradients of TCC (or LCC); or, how do their spectra 

compare. Finally, it seems imperative to perform this kind of investigation also for results 

obtained using more refined definitions of the sharp gradients in cloud cover, e.g., the one 

presented later in Section 6.3.3.1, more robust, and potentially able to provide better guidance 

for the compositing of the other key parameters.

5.2.2 Environmental conditions associated with main seasonal TCC fields 

The goal here is to describe the environmental conditions associated with distinct features of 

the cloud regimes (and respective cloud transitions) that occur during the JJA season in the 

tropical and subtropical NE Pacific ocean. A first step would have to do with the search for 

preferred spatiotemporal modes in the behaviour of the TCC field along the GPCI cross 

section. It was suggested that such investigation on the behaviour of the TCC field could be 

performed resorting to a clustering methodology. The decision to follow this kind of approach 

led to the development of GEPAT (Grade-based Empirical Pattern Analysis Technique), a 

novel cluster analysis technique introduced in Appendix A.4 to this thesis. Preliminary GEPAT 

results seem adequate for the accomplishment of that goal. It is in this context that ERA-40-

versus-ISCCP GEPAT results for TCC are used for the compositing of key dynamical and 

thermodynamical variables believed to have an important role in the maintenance and 

evolution of the cloud phenomenology in the GPCI region. The analysis of these results is done 

in Appendix A.4 and tries to qualitatively infer potential impacts of the interplay of those key 

parameters, on the regime transitions that, generally, occur in maritime regions adjacent to the 

eastern boundaries of the subtropical oceans. 

Figure 5.8 shows ERA-40 JJA 1998 seasonal mean fields of vertical velocity at 700 hPa 

(W700mb), liquid water path (LWP), sea surface temperature (SST), and low tropospheric 

stability (LTS) along the GPCI transect, together with section-averaged wind direction (direc) 

and speed. 

Again, this figure is analyzed in Appendix A.4. It was included here for illustration purposes.

6 Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes 

This chapter is dedicated to the study of the humidity structure in the (sub)tropical NE Pacific. 

The goal is to better understand its role as one of the main parameters in the context of the 

hydrologic cycle, particularly through its influence on cloud formation and evolution. For that 

end, state-of-the-art satellite observations are analyzed along the GPCI cross section, together 

with model simulations and atmospheric analyses. A number of results, based on the treatment 

of relative humidity data for the summer season, are presented, namely, seasonal mean 

profiles, variance, temporal evolution, boundary-layer properties, and potential impact on 

cloudiness structure and transition. 

6.1 Validation of simulations of relative humidity 

In this section, the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) is introduced. This advanced remote 

sensing instrument constitutes an important source of satellite data for numerical weather 

prediction and for climate research, specifically for its strengths in providing, with 

unprecedented detail and on a daily basis, global profiles of temperature and humidity. The 

focus is on the use of June-July-August (JJA) 2003 relative humidity information to validate 

model simulations. The section ends with a discussion of some of the challenges of bringing 

together models and observations, in an integrated and meaningful way, in the particular 

context of the GPCI transect. 

6.1.1 The Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder 

Until recently, most large-scale water vapor climatological studies have depended primarily on 

analyses of radiosonde data. Radiosondes have good resolution in the lower troposphere in 

populated regions, but are notoriously unreliable, and are usually unsuitable for detecting 

trends of water vapor in the upper troposphere. Also, these traditional measurement systems 

lack over remote oceanic regions. More recently, substantial progress has been made using 

satellite observations to obtain total column water vapor, and (low-resolution) vertical profiles 

of humidity, from infrared and microwave sensors. One disadvantage of satellite observations 

comes from their inability to provide water vapor data for certain weather and cloud 

conditions, or above a number of surface types.

AIRS 

AIRS (Aumann et al. 2003) is a state-of-the-art advanced infrared sounding system launched 

on May 4, 2002, on the NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Earth 

Observing System (EOS) Program’s Aqua platform, into a nominal altitude of 705 km in a 

circular sun-synchronous near-polar orbit with equatorial crossings at 0130 local time, on the 

descending (southward moving) orbit, and 1330 local time, on the ascending (northward 

moving) orbit. Its period is 98.8 min, and orbital correction maneuvers maintain the orbit with 

a repeat cycle of 16 days. Together with other instruments on Aqua (e.g., AMSU [Advanced 

Microwave Sounding Unit]), AIRS forms an integrated cross-track nadir-scanning sounding 

system. This instrument suite combines infrared and microwave retrievals, a feature designed 

to allow for a significant reduction of the limiting effects of cloud contamination in the field of 

view of infrared sounders. The infrared spectrometer/radiometer covers the 3.7 ?m to 15.4 ?m 

spectral range with 2378 spectral channels. With the basic goal of supporting NASA’s interest 

in process study and climate research, AIRS is, additionally, the first hyperspectral IR 

(InfraRed) radiometer designed to support NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric 

Administration) / NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) requirements for 

operational numerical weather forecasting. At launch, AIRS had an expected seven-year 

lifetime. The sounding goals of AIRS were to produce 1 km tropospheric-layer mean 

temperatures with a root-mean-squared (RMS) error of 1 K, and layer precipitable water with a 

RMS error of 20 %, in cases with up to 80 % effective cloud cover (also called effective 

fractional cloud cover, or infrared cloud fraction, given by the product of the fraction of the 

field of view [FOV] covered by clouds and the cloud emissivity at 11 ?m). It is the ability of 

the AIRS sounder to work in combination with the microwave sounder that enables the 

fulfillment of the “1 K/1 km” requirement for temperature, and 15 %/2 km humidity vertical 

resolution, globally, and under clear and cloudy conditions. In comparison to existing 

observations, AIRS brings high vertical resolution combined with global daily coverage. 

Of the 2378 spectral channels of the AIRS instrument, 1524 are used to derive regression 

coefficients, and considerably fewer channels are used in the AIRS physical retrieval steps. 

AIRS retrieval algorithms deconvolve spectrally adjacent lines whose weighting function 

peaks are spaced closely in the vertical. Ultimately, the retrievals from the instrument suite are 

made available as data in the form of calibrated spectral radiances, radiance estimates from 

forward models of radiative transfer, and geophysical state estimated through retrieval 

algorithms. Those data are made available through the GSFC (Goddard Space Flight Center) 

- 69 -

DAAC (Distributed Active Archive Center), mapped onto regular grids, referenced as “Level 

1B” (calibrated radiances), “Level 2” (spot by spot retrievals with nominal 45 km resolution 

from the AMSU FOV), and “Level 3” (global gridded) data. The L3 data are given on a 1° × 1° 

latitude-longitude grid, and can be downloaded as 1-day, 8-day, or monthly mean segments 

(the ascending and descending orbits are gridded separately). 

AIRS has been providing: ? atmospheric temperature profiles; ? specific humidity profiles; ? 

total precipitable water vapor; ? fractional cloud cover; ? cloud-top pressure and temperature; 

? total ozone burden of the atmosphere; ? column abundances of minor atmospheric gases 

(e.g., CO2, CH4, CO, and N2O); among other products. Of particular importance is the  

recognized ability of AIRS to measure water vapor in the upper troposphere between 300 hPa 

and 100 hPa. 

Validation efforts 

A number of relevant publications (e.g., Fetzer et al. 2003) have documented the comparison 

of AIRS retrieved products with collocated/contemporaneous independent data, to infer 

observational errors and establish the accuracy of those products. Radiosondes are the main 

source of such observational data. In general, the results validate the AIRS retrievals of 

temperature and humidity to within the design specifications. 

Tobin et al. (2006) used high-quality dedicated radiosondes, launched for AIRS validation at 

the Atmospheric Radiation Monitoring (ARM) Tropical Western Pacific (TWP) site at Nauru 

(166.9°E, 0.5°S), and another ARM site in Oklahoma, and concluded that, at Nauru, biases 

between AIRS and radiosonde water vapor were in the range -4 % to 6 % in 2 km layers in the 

lower troposphere (with total precipitable water vapor biases of less than 5 %, surpassing the 

theoretical limit of 5 % [Aumann et al. 2003]). They showed that the biases had only a weak 

dependence on cloud amount. Divakarla et al. (2006) compared AIRS full retrievals against 

globally available operational radiosondes (including both land and water cases) and reported 

biases of less than about 10 % in 2 km layers. They also found potential temperature biases of 

~ 0.5 K, at 600 hPa, and ~ -0.5 K, at 300 hPa (temporal variations in CO2 absorption may have 

contributed to slight biases in the retrievals). McMillin et al. (2007) use GPS data to rescale 

radiosonde profiles, and find overall agreement between the AIRS and radiosonde integrated 

precipitable water (IPW) vapor observations, indicative of the good performance of AIRS as a 

water vapor sounder (consistent with the results published by Tobin et al. [2006] and Divakarla 

et al. [2006] mentioned above). Focusing on the upper troposphere, Gettelman et al. (2004) 

compared AIRS profiles collocated to in situ aircraft data in the upper tropospheric / low

stratospheric region. They found a good match between temperatures in the two data sets, 

showing no bias, and a standard deviation of 1.5 K. For water vapor below 150 hPa the 

standard deviation was around 20 %, without big departures, and, in the same way, relative 

humidity at 250 hPa (and below) was also unbiased, with a standard deviation of 9 %. Fetzer et 

al. (2003), using data from Vaisala operational radiosondes over water, shows AIRS full 

retrievals of water vapor with biases of -4 % to 4 %, in 2 km layers, between the surface and 

500 hPa. Comparing AIRS with European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecast 

(ECMWF) reanalyses in the Eastern Pacific, and operational radiosondes in Southern 

California and Hawaii, Fetzer et al. (2004) showed biases of -5 % to 3 % for full retrievals in 

the surface-to-700 hPa layer. Fetzer et al. (2006), comparing matched AMSR-E (Advanced 

Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS) and AIRS independently-derived total precipitable 

water vapor (PWV) for two 16-day periods, showed RMS differences of about 0.2 kg/m2 (a 

better agreement than the global mean difference seen by Amenu and Kumar [2005] between 

NVAP [NASA Water Vapor Project] and a model reanalysis). Again, they notice weak 

dependence of biases on inferred AIRS cloud amount, indicating that the AIRS cloud clearing 

methodology (Susskind et al. 2003) does not introduce significant cloud-dependent biases. On 

a regional scale, the work points out to the fact that the largest AIRS wet observational biases 

were located in regions more affected by persistent stratus cloud cover, and that trade wind 

cumulus regions had observational biases between AIRS and AMSR-E near zero (it is also in 

the trades that AIRS full-retrieval yields peak to values as high as 90 %). 

Of special relevance for this work, is the generic conclusion that several comparisons of AIRS 

over-ocean full retrievals of water vapor against radiosondes, consistently indicate mean biases 

of only a few percent, usually irrespective to cloud amount up to 70 % to 80 % (AIRS effective 

fractional cloud cover). We note that previous examination of absolute differences in humidity, 

shows better agreement between AIRS and radiosondes over sea than over land, in line with 

the expectation that the AIRS retrievals should be more accurate over water (the higher surface 

reflectivities enhance the sensitivity of the microwave channels to changes in moisture). 

Finally, regarding the global AIRS retrievals, it has been concluded that, at least for humidity, 

temperature, and related products, the primary source of sampling biases is clouds affecting 

AIRS infrared signal. From the results of the retrieval algorithms’ calculations it is apparent 

that the percent of accepted geophysical parameters does decrease with increasing cloud 

fraction, in a manner that depends on the geophysical parameter. It can therefore be inferred 

that the fraction of AIRS full retrievals yields will vary with season and location. 

- 71 - 



-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - 

The identification of these biases can be done recurring to (global) comparisons between AIRS 

and, other satellite data sets, model reanalyses, or even GCM (General Circulation Model) 

simulations (preferably with an ensemble of different models). In this perspective, this work 

can be, in part, seen as yet another such effort, in which AIRS observational data are subject to 

comparison with model simulations in addressing regional-scale climate processes of 

importance to global climate (change) studies. 

6.1.2 AIRS relative humidity along GPCI 

For this study, AIRS-version-4 humidity and temperature data were processed following 

Gettelman et al. (2006) to obtain a dataset of relative humidity (RH) throughout the 

troposphere in the (sub)tropical NE Pacific Ocean. The resulting RH dataset, with daily 

temporal resolution for JJA 2003, is analyzed and compared to weather and climate prediction 

model simulations in the GPCI framework. 

More precisely, the first step for the calculation of RH profiles, was to gather available 

standard Level 2 (L2) profiles for which the infrared retrieval had been successfully completed. 

This is important, since, only the successful convergence of the algorithms during the final IR 

retrieval for the bottom-most part of the profile, can ensure full retrievals with the specified 

system accuracy of 1 K in 1 km layers (15 % in 2 km layers) over the entire temperature 

(humidity) profile (complete convergence occurs utilizing the full complement of microwave 

and infrared radiances from AMSU and AIRS, respectively). As mentioned, full retrievals 

occur more frequently under less cloudy conditions, and none are obtained for effective 

fractional cloud cover greater than about 80%. These water vapor (q) and temperature 

retrievals were then used to derive RH for each profile (RH = q/qs × 100, in percent, where qs 

is the saturation water vapor mixing ratio). The calculations of RH were further restricted to 

regions where water vapor is greater than 10 ppmv, the nominal reported instrument 

sensitivity. The formulation of Goff and Gratch (1946) over water, for temperatures &gt; 273 K (0 

°C), and over ice, for temperatures &amp;lt;253 K (-20 °C), was used to calculate qs. A linear 

combination was used between 253 K and 273 K. Other alternative formulations exist, but the 

fact that this is identical to what is used in (some) GCMs, may facilitate comparisons. Given 

the fact that the AIRS retrievals provide a column water vapor ( q ) between two pressure 

levels, and temperature on the corresponding (sub)layer edges, the RH profiles were calculated 

using a corresponding column saturation vapor pressure ( sq ) obtained from numerical 

integration of the saturation vapor pressure profile in the sublayer, assuming linear temperature

change between its two adjacent edges. Detailed sensitivity tests were conducted and the 

results are not highly sensitive to the method chosen (Gettelman et al. 2006). 

Finally, the profiles of RH (at the AMSU nominal ~ 45 km spatial resolution) were binned into 

a 1° × 1° latitude–longitude grid, with longitude bins held constant at 111 km. Also, the 

ascending and the descending orbits of Aqua were commingled in a single daily record. The 

dataset comes in 20 pressure levels between 1000 hPa and 5 hPa (1000, 925, 850, 700, 600, 

500, 400, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 70, 50, 30, 20, 15, 10, 7, and 5 hPa), but here only the 

information from the levels 70 hPa and below is used (it is believed that AIRS sensitivity to 

water vapor drops rapidly around 100 hPa). Bear in mind that, following the AIRS convention, 

these pressures refer to the bottom of the sublayers. 

As discussed above, the limiting effects of the presence of clouds in the AIRS FOV, implies a 

reduction of the number of full retrievals with increasing cloud amount. In this work it is 

assumed that, for the model simulations, the value corresponding to the 80 % AIRS effective 

fractional cloud cover threshold is of the order of 70 % total cloud cover (TCC). The 

consequences of this constrain in the sampling characteristics of AIRS data, and the way it 

affects/defines the methodology of model validation and intercomparison, is discussed in the 

next section (6.1.3 Matching models and observations). 

Figure 6.1 presents three samples of RH extracted for the GPCI cross section from the daily 

AIRS RH record. These are compared with GOES10 (Geostationary Operational 

Environmental Satellite 10) imagery in the infrared (channel 4, wavelength 10.7 ?m). The 

three different days were chosen as representing three distinct synoptic meteorological 

situations typically found during JJA 2003 in the (sub) tropical NE Pacific. A straight black 

line is superimposed on the GOES images to schematically locate the GPCI transect. Taking 

into account that the AIRS data corresponds to an entire 24 hour period of measurements, it 

was desired to find GOES images showing persistent meteorological features, as captured in 

the 00 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) and 12 UTC snapshots, corresponding to those 

same days in terms of the local time in the study area. The GOES images shown were all taken 

at 12 UTC, which, in local solar time, corresponds to approximately 03:40 am (~ 00:30 am) at 

the northernmost (southernmost) point in the cross section.

and a dormant ITCZ (Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone), at least in terms of the intensity of the 

deep convection in the vicinities of the transect. Looking at the 25 % RH line (between red and 

brown in the color scale), the AIRS RH transect clearly depicts an ITCZ centered at around 

8°N. Note also the relatively deep atmospheric boundary layer (BL), with a top (assumed, for 

the trades and the Sc areas to be [in a first approximation] the 50 % RH [e.g., Siebesma et al. 

2004] line [between the yellow and green colors]) consistently at ~ 850 hPa to the north of 

14°N. A prominent feature in this plot is the relative maximum in RH centered at 26°N,

-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - 

connecting the top of the BL to upper-level relatively high values of RH. In the mid row in Fig. 

6.1, dated August 26th, 2003, the GOES image shows, in contrast, an anemic infrared signal 

(basically spanning the entire portion of the tropical Pacific shown), associated with an active 

ITCZ, and a more homogeneous low level cloudiness field, extending southward along the 

cross section, from the subtropical Sc area to the trades (around 20°N, see the location of the 

Hawaiian Islands), where the cloudiness is broken, with the darker areas much probably 

associated with relatively clear skies. Note also the inexistence of any important mid-latitude 

cyclonic disturbance affecting the “area of catchment” of the section. Accordingly, and 

comparatively to the situation on August 7, the AIRS RH vertical cross section has a moister 

ITCZ, with a more well defined (and vertical) northern (RH) “boundary” (up until 300 hPa), 

and a generally lower BL top in the Sc area (especially to the north of 26°N). But, perhaps, the 

more striking aspect is now the very dry area, roughly between 750 hPa and 450 hPa, to the 

north of 17°N. Note the minimum above the trades (17°N to 23°N), with values of ~ 5 %, or 

less, RH. On August 30th, 2003 (bottom row in Fig. 6.1), four days after the previous situation 

described (mid row in Fig. 6.1), the region across the GPCI transect immediately to the east of 

the Hawaiian Islands, witnessed the peak strength of Jimena, by then a hurricane with 

sustained winds slightly over 160 km/h 

(http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/2003/jimena/jimena.php). This is clearly the main 

departure from what is seen in the previous GOES image (note that the Sc decks appear even 

more well defined on August 30). Jimena shows in the AIRS profiles centered at 20°N, and 

lends the RH cross-section a look that resembles a double ITCZ. 

In conclusion, the broad potential uses of the AIRS data are here undoubtedly displayed, even 

6.1.3 Matching models and observations 

A common feature of most of the studies referenced above (see [AIRS] Validation efforts, in 

in view of some of the physical processes affecting cloud formation and evolution discussed in 

Chapter’s 2 [Convection and clouds over the (sub)tropical oceans] Section 2.3 (e.g., the 

impacts of free tropospheric humidity on the subtropical Sc cloud decks). 

Section 6.1.1) is the focus on the observational validation, i.e., an assessment based on 

collocated, usually contemporaneous, matches between AIRS retrievals and the chosen 

correlative truth. Of primary importance in climate studies, though, are the uncertainties and 

biases that may arise from the temporal and spatial sampling characteristics of a certain 

instrument, and or remote sensing platform, and, particularly, their potential 

- 75 - 



-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - 

limitations/strengths under different atmospheric conditions. Moreover, in this context, it is 

frequently found that purely observational biases are only a small portion of total biases. 

Separating sampling induced misrepresentation of atmospheric state from the other error 

processes is one of the great challenges of validating and using satellite datasets. 

On the other hand, in validating model results with observations it is usually recommendable to 

 AIRS RH dataset 

 spatially match the observational and the simulated records of relative 

e vertical, recall that the preliminary procedure 

adapt the numerical simulations output to the spatial and temporal resolutions of the 

observational dataset. This is generally done by applying certain constrains, thresholds, or 

compositing the model record. Naturally, this mindset can be reversed in case the available 

model data is, in any particular perspective, more limited than the observational data. 

Relatively sophisticated methodologies have been developed with these concerns in mind, 

being the ISCCP simulator (see Section 3.4, Observational datasets) a good example of the 

efforts toward more meaningful comparisons of models and observations. 

This section presents the methodologies followed to characterize the

prepared for GPCI introduced above. As the investigation of observational biases is outside the 

scope of this study, the main focus is on sampling biases, and potential consequences to the 

results presented in the following sections. 

Spatial matching 

Horizontal    To

humidity was the first task to be accomplished. First of all, the model data was made available 

by the different centers already along the cross section, following the GPCI specifications 

(which did not suggest any particular way to extract the results to the 13 points comprising the 

transect, or to the grid cells in the broader 2D maps [Section 3.2.2, Project protocol]). The 

participating centers reported the use of different techniques for that end (e.g., nearest grid 

point, bilinear interpolation). Table 3.1 shows the horizontal resolution and number of vertical 

levels of the different models. In the case of the AIRS data, the original 1° × 1° latitude-

longitude grid had to be degraded to the 5° × 5° resolution of the 2D maps, and to the 13 

locations along the GPCI transect. Given that the GPCI points coincided with grid nodes in the 

AIRS dataset, it was decided to take the average RH of the nearest 4 AIRS grid nodes to get 

the values for the 2D and transect locations. 

Vertical    Regarding the matching in th

followed to obtain RH from the AIRS temperature and specific humidity retrievals (Section 

6.1.2), used an inferred (linear) temperature profile between adjacent (temperature) pressure 

- 76 - 



-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - 

levels to calculate the column saturation vapor pressure from the humidity value for the 

corresponding sublayer. This means that the RH information on the AIRS vertical grid actually 

applies to the sublayer above the pressure levels themselves. To better correlate models and 

observations, the relative humidity profiles were linearly interpolated in the vertical (at each 

one of the GPCI locations) to a common 10 hPa -spaced regular pressure grid (the AIRS data 

was analogously interpolated in the vertical). The interpolated model simulations correspond 

thus to point values. An alternative would be to further integrate these values in the vertical for 

each (overlying) sublayer. This would require the assumption of a certain vertical profile for 

the relative humidity in the sublayers, a procedure that was not adopted in the this work, also to 

preserve a higher degree of detail in the vertical. 

Temporal matching 

To match the 3-hourly model output with the daily temporal resolution of the AIRS data, daily 

ned, in this work it is assumed that, for the model simulations, the value

simulation output. 

averages were calculated for the RH simulations. Apart from the seasonal averages and the 

percentages shown in the results that follow, all other calculations (e.g., variance [standard 

deviation], moving averages [temporal evolution]) were performed on the daily record. 

Sampling matching 

As previously mentio

corresponding to the 80 % AIRS effective fractional cloud cover threshold is ~ 70 % TCC. 

This value was then applied as an upper threshold for the selection, among the 3-hourly model 

output, of only those profiles of RH contemporaneous with values of the TCC parameter below 

70 % (inclusive). The accrued RH profiles were then the basis for the calculation of the 

“constrained results” used for a more direct comparison with AIRS. 

The top row in Fig. 6.2 shows, for some of the participating model

2003 mean TCC along the GPCI cross section. It also depicts the 70 % TCC (horizontal green) 

line, and the percentage of time TCC is less than or equal to 70 % at each one of the transect 

locations, which is also the percentage of “usable” RH profiles according to the TCC constrain 

(TCC70% hereinafter). As expected, the locations mostly affected by the TCC70% constrain, 

are those with the highest average TCC values, pronouncedly the ITCZ region (~ 8°N), where 

the number of usable profiles can be as low as ~ 20%, and the Sc regions (especially at 32°N). 

The trades (~ 17°N to 20°N) are less affected by the constrain, showing, in two of the models, 

values that surpass 70%. Note that these percentages were obtained from the 3-hourly record of

e bottom row in Fig. 6.2 presents, for the same models, cross sections of the differenc

results show a general dry bias, especially between levels 800 hPa and 200 hPa, and between 

2°N and 17°N (around the ITCZ). This is in line with the fact that, in the ITCZ, higher values 

of TCC are typically associated with more intense deep convection and higher RH values at all 

levels in the vertical. The models seem to produce this (note, however, the slight moist bias at 

lower levels in the ITCZ in NCAR). Regarding the Sc region, it is interesting to notice that the 

models with the highest TCCs in those areas (to the north of ~ 26°N) show, in these plots, a 

wet bias right above the boundary layer. Again, this is, potentially, a good sign for these 

models, since it is expected that higher Sc cloudiness to be associated with a relatively dry free 

troposphere above the BL. BMRC shows clear departures from the other models in all features 

analyzed. 

In conclusion, these model results depict quite well what was presented earlier regarding AIRS

for a given dataset, as the difference “TCC70%-constrained minus unconstrained” (unless 

otherwise noted, the bias is evaluated directly from the seasonal means); 2) the moving 

averages used are simple unweighted previous moving averages that include the day in 

question and the previous 4 days (after preliminary investigation, the choice of a 5-days 

window seemed the best balance between the need to filter some transient meteorological 

signal and the availability of data in the constrained record of model-simulated RH); 3) for 

either the constrained, or the unconstrained records, the standard deviation is calculated, at the 

different locations along the cross section, individually for each level in the vertical profiles 

(the variance is evaluated from the daily averaged model output).

(sub)tropical NE Pacific, with the ITCZ centered at 8°N (in June [not shown] the ITCZ is 

located between 5°N and 8°N, while in August [not shown] it is located between 8°N and 

11°N), a moist BL, and a relatively dry free troposphere, capped by higher RH values in the 

tropopause. A look at the daily record of AIRS RH transects indicates that this (typical 

climatological) RH picture, not rarely, suffers disruption during the season, especially owing, 

for instance, to the influence of baroclinic disturbances, in the northernmost part of the section, 

and tropical depressions and hurricanes, in the lower latitudes (see Fig. 6.1). Still, it is, mostly, 

the sampling idiosyncrasy of the AIRS experiment (especially in what concerns the presence of 

clouds) that ultimately modulates the RH evolution in this particular dataset. In more detail, the 

- 79 - 



-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - 

mean RH section is characterized by a very moist BL, with values above 70 % at 1000 hPa 

along the whole cross section (recall that, for AIRS, a value at 1000 hPa actually represents the 

layer between 1000 hPa and 925 hPa), being over 95 % between just north of 20°N and the 

ITCZ, a hint that the trades constitute an important source of the moisture that help fuel (via 

latent heat release) the deep convection in the ITCZ (recall that the low-level atmospheric flow 

blows along the trades in the direction of the ITCZ, and experiences increasing sea surface 

temperatures [SSTs]). Regarding the top of the BL (BLT), if one takes the 50 % RH line to be 

a proxy for its location (e.g., Siebesma et al. 2004), the BLT is at its lowest position at 35°N, at 

~ 940 hPa, and deepens southward until a value of ~ 860 hPa, at 17°N. Noteworthy is also the 

(overall) southward intensification (weakening) of the vertical gradient of RH just below 

(above) the BLT between those two positions. For July (not shown) the southward deepening 

of the BL is the steepest, while for August (not shown) the BLT is close to 850 hPa for most of 

the transect between 20°N and 32°N. In the vertical, the seasonal ITCZ is characterized by a 

dome-shaped structure capped by a layer of RH with values as high as 50 % up to ~ 530 hPa. 

At 500 hPa, there is a minimum in the amount, and latitudinal extent, of the ITCZ RH, with the 

layers above showing the reverse picture until the tropical tropopause is reached at ~ 150 hPa 

(at 8°N). Finally, the driest portion of the vertical section is found in a layer between 650 hPa 

and 450 hPa (mid troposphere), essentially extending from the trades to the Sc (in the northern 

portion of the section), and showing values below 20 % RH. This minimum is associated with 

the large scale atmospheric subsidence that characterizes the dynamics of the subtropical free 

atmosphere. In June (not shown) that domain is even broader, both vertically and horizontally, 

and the RH falls below 10 % in a thin layer centered at 600 hPa between latitudes 26°N and 

29°N.

odels presented in Fig. 6.2, JJA 2003 cross sections of 

he right plot in Fig. 6.3 shows the corresponding RH standard deviation for JJA 2003. Note

that both plots in this figure use the same color scale. There is an outstanding difference 

between the structure of the mean RH and the corresponding standard deviation field, with the 

standard deviation assuming notoriously lower values (below 25 %). One of the areas that 

shows the least variability in humidity extends from 23°N to (at least) the south end of the 

cross section, and is found generally below 900 hPa, coinciding with the area of highest mean 

RH values. In contrast, relatively high values of standard deviation (15 % to 20 %) are found in 

a layer with a constant top close to 890 hPa between 35°N and 26°N (Sc region). This feature 

is probably associated with the local variability in the location of the BLT. Lower standard 

deviation values (10 % to 15 %), homogeneously spread between 20°N and 35°N, and 870 hPa 

and 450 hPa, are an indication of the relative steadiness of the subtropical subsidence during 

JJA 2003. Another interesting detail in this plot is the minimum that extends in the vertical to 

about 600 hPa roughly between 2°N and 8°N, in clear contrast with the higher values found 

immediately to the north of it. This may, in part, be explained by the northward shift of the 

ITCZ during the season, an argument, in part, supported by the higher values in the vertical to 

the south of 2°N. Finally, the highest values of RH standard deviation for JJA 2003 are mainly 

found between 2°N and 11°N, centered between 300 hPa and 400 hPa, at the base (and mostly 

towards the south) of the upper-level relative maximum of (mean) RH associated with the 

tropical tropopause above the ITCZ. 

Figure 6.4 shows, for the same four m

seasonal mean RH, RH standard deviation, and the corresponding biases versus the respective 

AIRS results. Keep in mind that these are (TCC70%) constrained results. All the models show, 

in the RH means (column to the left), the general features associated with the RH signature of 

the Hadley circulation described above for AIRS (left plot in Fig. 6.3), and in a previous 

chapter, for the unconstrained model results (Fig. 4.4). Regarding the comparison with the 

AIRS seasonal mean RH (second column from the left), there are significant biases in these 

models, namely: i) a very important negative bias in the lowest portion of the BL (except to the 

north of 32°N); ii) in contrast with a strong wet bias immediately above it, along the whole 

transect (except for NCAR, with the wet bias confined between 11°N and 20°N), a situation 

associated with deeper BLs in the models than in AIRS; iii) in the deep convection area 

(around 8°N), there is (above a surface dry bias extending up to ~ 900 hPa) a wet bias between 

~ 800 hPa and ~ 450 hPa, associated with, not just higher RHs going to higher levels, but also 

with wider ITCZs than in AIRS (the exception being ECMWF, with a slightly narrower ITCZ);

iv) the tropopause layer shows, overall, higher RHs in the models; v) the subtropical mid 

troposphere is, except for the BMRC model, generally drier in the models, especially 

immediately above the BL, with biases of up to -30 % RH relative to AIRS (this situation may 

be associated with a poor link between large-scale subsidence field and RH, and or with the 

misrepresentation of the influence of transient extratropical disturbances on the free 

tropospheric humidity structure [see top row in Fig. 6.1]).

It could probably be argued that this is also the case for AIRS, i.e., the sampling deficiencies 

result in a more static RH structure. Still, although the models show, overall, higher RH 

variability, there are distinct features in the comparison with AIRS. The right column in Fig. 

6.4 shows a lack of variability in RH in the BL along the entire cross section, with models 

presenting negative standard deviation biases of up to -20 % in the subtropical BL (23°N to 

35°N) (recall that the variance is evaluated from the daily averaged model output and not from 

the 3-hourly record). This is probably associated with the simulation of persistently deep 

subtropical BLs, as in the ECMWF and UKMO models. Another noteworthy feature is the 

positive bias just above the BL (particularly north of 20°N). More so than a model deficiency, 

this is probably associated with the relatively poor vertical resolution of this AIRS dataset, 

which may not the able to detect the finer detail in the variability of the vertical location of the 

BL top, particularly in the subtropics. 

6.2.2 Intraseasonal evolution 

To qualitatively investigate how the vertical structure of RH evolves during the JJA season, 5-

ations 

day running means of the RH record were obtained for different locations in the GPCI cross 

section (the details are given above in Bias, moving averages, and standard deviation 

calculation). The corresponding JJA 2003 results for AIRS and two of the participating models 

are shown in Fig. 6.5. Again, the model results are obtained from the (TCC70%) composited 

RH profiles, being the vertical white columns in the plots, gaps arising from (at least) five 

consecutive days with TCCs above 70 %. From the discussion of Fig. 6.2, this situation is 

expected to occur more frequently in the NCAR model than in the BMRC model, and, for any 

of the models, more frequently in the deep convection and Sc regions, than in the trades. 

Looking at the larger set of models, a general first conclusion is that, for the three loc

shown (8°N, 20°N, and 32°N), there seems to be, overall, a better spatiotemporal correlation 

between any two given models than between the models and AIRS. It is also immediately 

apparent that the comparison of models and AIRS in terms of the humidity content in the BL, 

ITCZ, and subtropical mid troposphere, presented above, is still patent in these results, 

particularly in what concerns the model biases in the lowest levels along the transect, and the 

depth of the BL. What these plots put in evidence is essentially the fact that, at 32°N, the RH 

variations tend to be coherent throughout the entire profile, as opposed to having (especially at 

20°N [trades]) periods when a drying of the mid troposphere is accompanied by a moistening 

at upper levels. This seems to point out to the need to include in the investigation of the

breakup of the Sc cloud decks that happens in the transition to the trade-wind shallow cumulus, 

the influence, not just of the humidity structure in the free troposphere immediately above the 

BL, but also of the humidity profile all the way to the upper troposphere. A synergistic 

approach between AIRS and other instruments onboard Aqua could be tried to tackle this 

issue.

-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - 

model simulations, atmospheric analysis, and AIRS observations. Section 6.3.3 (Cloud cover 

transitions) revisits the topic of abrupt transitions in cloud cover along the GPCI transect, 

firstly, by introducing an updated methodology for the location of these discontinuities in the 

cloud fields. The corresponding results are then used as guidance for the calculation of the 

spatial averages of relative humidity profiles, composited as located upwind, or downwind, of 

the location of the strong cloud cover gradients thus found during the JJA 2003 season in data 

from models and analysis. 

6.3.1 Relative humidity as a proxy for boundary layer depth 

Owing to the complexity of its phenomenology, the boundary layer has been given a great deal 

of attention in observational and in modelling studies. Simulation of boundary layer clouds in 

global climate models is still a challenge (e.g., Weare 2004; Bony and Dufresne 2005; Teixeira 

et al. 2008b; Karlsson et al. 2008), and would benefit from a better understanding of the 

observed behaviour of the planetary boundary layer. In this context a few related studies can be 

highlighted, namely: Seibert et al. (2000) thoroughly review and compare operational methods 

for the determination of the height of the atmospheric boundary layer (e.g., methods that use 

profile data from measurements [radiosonde profiles, sodar and wind profiler data] or from 

numerical model output, and mixing height parameterization using simple equations or 

models); Karlsson et al. (2010), present a cloud-top height (CTH) approach (discussed in 

Section 5.1.4 of this work) for the determination of the (sub)tropical maritime boundary layer 

top (BLT) from satellite observations, reanalysis data, and climate model simulations (an 

example among other satellite-based methodologies developed to tackle the issue of the 

determination of the BLT on a global scale from satellite data); passive-sensor CTH methods 

(e.g., Minnis et al. 1992; Wood and Bretherton 2004; Zuidema et al. 2009) have been 

successfully applied in regions dominated by low level (stratocumulus) clouds (e.g., Stevens et 

al. 2007); spaceborn lidars (active sensors) have been used to estimate the boundary layer 

height (BLH) from observed CTHs in stratocumulus areas (e.g., Ahlgrimm and Randall 2006; 

Lin et al. 2009); based on satellite retrieved vertical distributions of temperature and humidity, 

other studies have tried to locate the inversion that typically caps the maritime boundary layer, 

e.g., Fetzer et al. (2004), using AIRS, and von Engeln et al. (2005), using radio occultation 

data; in addition to CTH, Karlsson et al. (2010) present an alternative technique to determine 

BLT and estimate BLH from the vertical gradient of relative humidity.

-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - 

More specifically, Karlsson et al. (2010) used “the height of the maximum vertical RH gradient 

with respect to pressure” found between the surface and 700 hPa. The method was successfully 

applied along the GPCI cross section to models, analysis, and AIRS observations, and the 

results showed, mostly in the subtropics, a fairly good agreement with the CTH-based BLT 

estimate for the same models and analysis, and MISR (Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer) 

observations. In the next section, an updated version of the RH-based methodology is 

introduced. It basically consists of additional conditions imposed to the evaluation of the RH 

profile in a sequence of stages of increasing constrain refinement. The methodology has thus 

been named sBLT, for sequential Boundary-Layer-Top determination scheme. 

The introduction to sBLT starts with a brief overview of the main concepts behind its 

operation, followed by a description of the basic algorithm and subsequent steps for the 

determination of the BLT from a given RH profile. The section then proceeds to a discussion 

of a number of statistics to characterize the climatological BLT for a given location. After a 

few additional remarks, and the presentation of developments envisioned for the near future, 

preliminary results are discussed for a few case studies. sBLT statistics for JJA 2003 along the 

GPCI transect are analyzed for models, and atmospheric analysis. To close the section, the 

same kind of statistics are presented for the corresponding AIRS RH record. 

6.3.2 A new scheme to determine the BLT 

The RH results analyzed up to this point in the thesis, obtained from models and observations, 

either as seasonal climatologies, or at particular times during the JJA season (Fig. 4.4, Fig. 6.1, 

Fig 6.3, Fig. 6.4, and Fig 6.5), show that in the (sub)tropical NE Pacific the MBL is typically 

very moist, at least as seen along the GPCI cross section. Moreover, there is, for all of the 

transect locations in all those results, a marked upward decrease in RH at some point in the 

vertical profile, separating the moist lower levels from a relatively dry mid troposphere. It is 

known that these are important features of the (sub)tropical MBL, and that, in particular, the 

sharp decrease in RH is typically associated with the approximate location of its top. Locating 

the level of the strong decrease in RH has been the basic motive behind a number of RH-based 

BLT determination methods recently proposed in the literature (e.g., Karlsson et al. 2010, 

Martins et al. 2010). Introduced below, sBLT is yet another such proposal. RH is believed to 

be a befitting variable for this purpose owing to the fact that it depends on both temperature 

and humidity. 

- 86 - 



-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - 

6.3.2.1 Basic concepts 

Humidity Profile    The sBLT methodology is solely based on the manipulation of relative 

humidity data (observational, or simulated) given in the form of vertical profiles spanning the 

layer from the surface to (ideally) the upper troposphere. In the first data treatment step, 

profiles are screened for bad values (inexistent data, or RH &amp;lt;0 % [RH &gt; 100 % is, at this stage, 

included in the analysis]), being disregarded if a bad data entry is found at one or more levels. 

In the second step, the RH information is interpolated to a regularly-spaced vertical grid (in 

what follows, the RH is assumed to be on a vertical pressure grid). The interpolation to a 

common vertical grid is especially useful when dealing with RH information from different 

sources, either used in combination, or for the purposes of comparison between different 

datasets. Specific issues arising from the interpolation procedure are discussed later (see 

Additional Remarks). 

RH-Gradient Profile    Once a RH profile has been screened and interpolated, it is used for 

the calculation of the corresponding RH-gradient (RHgrad) profile. The RH and pressure 

information for two adjacent levels is used such that the RHgrad for the layer bounded by the 

two levels is obtained dividing the RH difference between the top and bottom levels by the 

difference in pressure between the bottom and top levels. This value is then assigned to the mid 

level for that layer (this implies that the levels in the RHgrad profile correspond to the mid 

levels of the original RH profile). Given the pressure drop going up in the profile, this assures 

that a positive (negative) RHgrad corresponds to an increase (a decrease) in RH between the 

bottom and the top levels of the layer in question. 

Upper Threshold    For a given sublayer in the RH profile, the upper threshold (ut) is the RH 

value at the respective top level (this level is then called put). 

Lower Threshold    For a given sublayer in the RH profile, the lower threshold (lt) is the RH 

value at the respective bottom level (this level is then called plt). 

Lower Cumulative Average Line    For a given sublayer in the RH profile, the lower 

cumulative average line (local) starts at the respective plt, where it is equal to lt, and is built all 

the way to the bottom of the profile, taking, at each profile level, a value equal to the 

cumulative average of the RHs from all the levels between it (inclusive) and the plt. The local 

is also assigned to the corresponding RHgrad level, i.e., the midlevel of the sublayer in the RH 

profile. The local should be seen as a continuous line, with values between the profile levels 

obtained from the linear interpolation of the local values at respective adjacent levels. 

- 87 - 



-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - 

S1 index    A given level in the RHgrad profile is classified as S1 if the corresponding RHgrad 

is different than zero (irrespective of the sign). As an index, S1 can be 0, or 1, respectively 

when RHgrad is 0, or RHgrad is different than zero. 

S2 index    If a given level in the RHgrad profile is a S1, it will be classified (also) as a S2 if 

the corresponding RHgrad is negative (i.e., RH decreases between the bottom and the top 

[levels] of the respective sublayer in the RH profile). As an index, S2 will be 1 if RHgrad is 

negative, and 0 otherwise. 

S3 index    If a given level in the RHgrad profile is a S2, it will be classified (also) as a S3 if 

the corresponding local is never lower than the corresponding ut (in which case S3 = 1). In 

case the local gets to be lower than ut, S3 will be given a value between 0 (exclusive) and 1 

(exclusive), obtained from the division of the difference in pressure between the point where 

the local (first [going from plt toward the bottom of the profile]) gets to be equal to ut and the 

plt, by the difference in pressure between the bottom of the RH profile and plt. S3 will only be 

0 if S2 is equal to 0. S3 is the only continuous S# index. 

S4 index    If a given level in the RHgrad profile is a S2, it will be classified (also) as a S4 if, at 

the bottom of the RH profile, the corresponding local is not lower than lt. In that case S4 is 

equal to 1, being equal to 0 otherwise (i.e., if S2 = 0, or the local is lower than lt at the bottom 

of the RH profile). Note that there isn’t, at this point, any direct link between S4 and S3, in the 

sense that a level in the RHgrad profile can be a S4 without it (fully) being a S3. The only 

commonality arises from the fact that both S3 (full or partial) and S4 need to be a S2. A link 

between S3 and S4 is imposed at a later stage in the scheme (as explained below at sS#). 

S# Order    There is an order implied in the S# classification. A level classified as a S4 is said 

to be higher in the classification order, than a level that could not be classified as being more 

than a S3, and so on. 

S# Classification of the RHgrad Profile    Before proceeding to the basic sBLT algorithm, 

each level in the RHgrad profile has to be classified following the sequence of S# indexes 

presented above. The input information for the basic algorithm is, for each level (mid level) in 

the RHgrad (RH) profile: 1) pressure; 2) RHgrad strength (absolute value of RHgrad); 3) 

RHgrad sign; 4) S1 index; 5) S2 index; 6) S3 index; and 7) S4 index. 

The S Profile    A S profile is obtained by locating in the RHgrad profile the levels with the 

strongest full S# indexes, that is, for each one of the (four) S# = 1, the one with the highest 

RHgrad strength (irrespective of the sign) is picked to represent S# in the S profile. It can then 

- 88 - 



-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - 

happen that a S profile may not have a S3 determined (if all are 0 &amp;lt;S3 &amp;lt;1), even if it has a S4 

determined. Another possible situation is the one for which the same level in the RHgrad 

profile is assigned all four S#, i.e., it has the strongest S1, which, in turn is also a S2, a (full) 

S3, and a S4. 

The strict S# (sS#)    If a level classified as a S4 is only a partial S3, i.e., 0 &amp;lt;S3 &amp;lt;1, then its 

sS# will only be a sS2, that is, it will, in the more strict sense, be classified as a sS2. This arises 

from the fact that, the sS# classification sequence starts at the lowest S# (S1) and chooses it as 

the sS# if S(#+1) is not 1, thus stopping at S2 if S3 is only partial, even if S4 is equal to 1. This 

imposes a tight link between sS3 and sS4, and ensures that, when analyzing the final sBLT 

results, any BLT classified as a sS4 is known to be a sS3 as well (i.e., a full S3 [S3 = 1]). More 

importantly, a sS# is never a sS(#+1). Even when only a partial S3, S4 levels are, nevertheless, 

useful for the purposes of initialization of the basic sBLT algorithm. 

6.3.2.2 The basic sBLT algorithm 

Four main steps comprise the basic sBLT algorithm, they are ordered as follows: 

1: In the RHgrad profile, identification of the level with the strongest RHgrad (irrespective of 

the sign) among the levels with the highest S# classification (see S# Order above). The search 

is performed only on full S# indexes, i.e., S# = 1 (any S# = 0, or 0 &amp;lt;S3 &amp;lt;1, are disregarded at 

this step). 

2: Using the level chosen at step 1: as a reference, proceed down in the profile, and elect it as 

the BLT if: the level is already the lowest level in the RHgrad profile; or, all levels below it are 

as high as it is in the S# classification order; or, all levels below it are either sS1, or S1 = 0. 

3: If at step 2: no BLT has been determined, then, using the level chosen at step 1: as a 

reference, proceed down in the profile to the level with the strongest RHgrad that is stronger 

than the RHgrad of the reference level, chosen among the levels classified as S(r-1), being Sr 

the classification of the reference level. In case no level is found to meet the condition, the 

search is instead performed among the levels classified as S(r-2). And so on. The search stops 

at S2, i.e., this search is not to be performed among levels classified as S1. 

4: If at step 3: a level has been found to meet the imposed condition, it is then taken to step 2: 

of the algorithm and subject to the same scrutiny going down the algorithm step sequence. On 

the other hand if no level has been found to meet the condition imposed at step 3:, the 

reference level from step 1: is chosen as the BLT for the profile being analyzed. 

- 89 - 



-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - 

S! The following information is then stored for S!, the BLT determined by the basic algorithm: 

1) pressure (keep in mind that this is a level of the RHgrad profile corresponding to a mid level 

of the original RH profile); 2) RHgrad strength (absolute value of RHgrad); 3) RHgrad sign; 

and 4) sS#. 

Note that S! can only be a S1 if no level in the RHgrad profile has been classified as higher that 

S1. 

6.3.2.3 BLT determination 

Partial-Profile Looping    In the partial-profile loop, S! are obtained for all and each one of 

the subprofiles that are embedded in the full RHgrad profile, that is, starting with the full 

RHgrad profile (i.e., the one with the bottom at the lowest RHgrad profile level and the top at 

the highest RHgrad profile level), each successive profile with the bottom at the lowest 

RHgrad profile level and the top at the RHgrad profile level right below the top level of the 

previous subprofile. The first subprofile in this sequence is then the full profile itself, the 

second subprofile will have its top at the level just below the top of the first subprofile, and so 

on. The final result is a catalogue of all the S! thus obtained, and, in particular, the number of 

times/subprofiles for which a given RHgrad level has been chosen as the S!. 

S! Dp    With the information from the partial-profile loop it is possible to determine, for each 

RHgrad level ever chosen as a S!, the corresponding lifespan, i.e., the RHgrad profile span 

comprised between the tops of the first and last subprofiles for which it has been chosen as the 

S!. Note that the operation of the basic algorithm described above implies that the RHgrad 

level in question was continuously chosen as the S! during the respective portion of the partial-

profile loop sequence. Defining ftop as the pressure at the RH-profile level just above the top 

level of the first subprofile, and ltop as the pressure at the RH-profile level just below the top 

level of the last subprofile (recall that the RHgrad profile levels correspond to mid levels of the 

RH profile), Dp is calculate, for all RHgrad levels ever chosen as the S!, as the difference 

between the respective ltop and ftop (Dp = ltop - ftop). 

7.S1    For the purposes of comparison of the sBLT results with the results that would be 

obtained following the RH-based BLT determination technique of Karlsson et al. (2010) (JK10 

hereinafter), the strongest RHgrad for the subprofile with ftop = 700 hPa is identified. Once 

located, the level corresponding to this (strongest) RHgrad is stored as 7.S1, where S1 comes 

from the fact that this specific RHgrad is the S1 that would have been chosen for the S profile 

- 90 - 



-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - 

(see details above at The S Profile) corresponding to the RHgrad profile with ftop at 700 hPa. 

Keep in mind that JK10 focused solely on the RH information below 700 hPa. Also, since 

JK10 does not make explicit reference to the sign of the gradient, it is here assumed that S1 

would be their choice (recall that an S1 in the S profile may not necessarily be an S2). 

7.S2    In addition to the search for 7.S1, it can be of interest to find 7.S2, which is the S2 that 

would have been chosen for the S profile (see details above at The S Profile) corresponding to 

the RHgrad profile with ftop at 700 hPa. Note that 7.S2 is the strongest RHgrad with negative 

sign, i.e., the strongest RH decrease with height, found in the RHgrad profile with ftop at 700 

hPa. 

PPtop    As will be seen below, it may be of interest to find, in the RHgrad profile, the level 

with the highest Dp. In a more general situation this search can be performed on only a specific 

(intermediate) portion of the RHgrad profile. In case the search is to be done between the 

bottom and a specific level of the RHgrad profile, the level with the highest Dp thus found is 

said to be associated with PPtop, where PP stands for partial profile, and top is a given pressure 

value (e.g., 650 hPa). If top is the pressure at the top of the (full) RHgrad profile, PPtop is 

called FP (for full profile). Note that, in either case (intermediate portion of the profile, FP, or 

PPtop) the Dp values are the ones obtained from the analysis of the RHgrad profile as a whole. 

Final sBLT Solution    The final sBLT solution is the BLT corresponding to the RHgrad level 

with the highest Dp. As mentioned above, the choice can be made among only the RHgrad 

levels comprised between a particular portion of the RHgrad profile, although, typically, the 

final sBLT solution is obtained for, either the FP, or a given PPtop. The following information 

is then stored for the final sBLT solution: 1) pressure (keep in mind that this is a level of the 

RHgrad profile corresponding to a mid level of the original RH profile); 2) RHgrad strength 

(absolute value of RHgrad); 3) RHgrad sign; 4) sS#; and 5) whether the final solution is, or 

not, the 7.S1 (the values for this parameter are then 1, or 0, respectively). It should be stressed 

at this point that a sS# is never a sS(#+1). But, as mentioned above [The strict S# (sS#)], a sS# 

is necessarily a sS(#-1). For instance, it can never happen that a level classified as a sS1 is 

simultaneously a sS2 (or above), meaning that a sS1 is strictly an increase in RH with height. 

This is in clear contrast with the situation for the S profile, for which a S# can be a S(#+1). 

6.3.2.4 Climatological BLT characterization 

- 91 - 



-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - 

The sBLT methodology can be applied to a single RH profile or to a number of profiles in a 

given spatiotemporal domain, in which case a number of statistics are typically obtained. Note 

that, a prerequisite for the statistical analysis, is that all individual elements of the sBLT 

solutions set, for a spatiotemporal domain of interest, need to have been found for a common 

PPtop. 

BLT Level    The mean pressure for all the final sBLT solutions [point 1) of Final sBLT 

Solution above]. 

BLT Strength    The mean RHgrad strength for all the final sBLT solutions [point 2) of Final 

sBLT Solution above (again, RHgrad strength is the absolute value of RHgrad)]. 

sS# Distribution    The histogram of sS# for the final sBLT solutions [point 4) of Final sBLT 

Solution above]. 

not7.S1    Two things are evaluated for this statistic, one is the percentage (among the set of 

BLTs determined for the particular spatiotemporal domain) of final sBLT solutions that do not 

coincide with 7.S1 [a value of zero for the parameter in point 5) of Final sBLT Solution 

above], and the other is the percentage (among the set of BLTs determined for the particular 

spatiotemporal domain) of final sBLT solutions with pressures [point 1) of Final sBLT 

Solution above] less than 700 hPa. 

6.3.2.5 Additional remarks 

Strongest-S# Disambiguation    In case the highest RHgrad strength for a given S# (with an 

index S# = 1) is found at two or more levels in the RHgrad profile, a disambiguation procedure 

is needed whenever it is desired to have only one level chosen. This is required, for instance, 

when trying to build a S Profile, or for the initialization of the basic sBLT algorithm, or to 

determine 7.S1. The currently adopted disambiguation procedure starts by looking at the value 

of the S(#+1) index for each one of the “ambiguous” levels, and chooses the level for which 

this index is the highest. If still there is the need for disambiguation in terms of the S(#+1) 

index values, the procedure then looks at the value of the S(#+2) index for each one of the 

remaining (“ambiguous”) levels, and so on. If the procedure gets all the way to the evaluation 

of the last index in the S# sequence, i.e., S4, and still two or more levels remain 

(“ambiguous”), the one closest to the bottom of the profile is chosen. Note that the use of S3 as 

a continuous (0 ? S3 ? 1) index is only applied for the purposes of this kind of disambiguation. 

For any other uses, it is seen as a “0 or 1” index (like all the other S# indexes). In the particular 

- 92 - 



-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - 

case the set of levels that need to be disambiguated are nonadjacent to each other, this final 

choice is based on the fact that the lowest level would (to the highest degree) be the one less 

marked by relatively dry sublayers below it. In the particular case the set of levels that need to 

be disambiguated are adjacent to each other (e.g., corresponding to sublayers obtained from the 

interpolation of a larger sublayer of the original RH profile with a  given vertical rate of change 

for RH), the final choice is based on the (first order) assumption that, at the top of the boundary 

layer, the decrease of RH going up in the vertical is such that (locally) the corresponding 

(underlying [continuous]) RH curve is concave up, meaning that the highest decrease rate is 

found right at the BLT. This feature would then not be as clear in discrete RH profiles, such as 

the ones typically obtained from models and observations (especially if given in coarse vertical 

resolution). The disambiguation choice is then an attempt at getting closer to the actual BLT 

(this is revisited below at Future Developments). 

Basic sBLT Algorithm Initialization    By starting the basic algorithm at the level with the 

strongest RHgrad among the levels with the highest S# classification, the sBLT scheme tries to 

apply a first screening of the RHgrad profile for levels that overlay thick layers of dry air. Such 

RHgrad profile levels have the lowest probability of getting to the highest S# in the S# 

classification sequence. Extremely dry air intrusions are thus assumed to be atypical 

occurrences in the (subtropical) maritime boundary layers. 

Regular p Profiles    Although the linear interpolation makes the vertical distribution of RH 

smoother, the location of the main gradients in the profile should not change much if the new 

vertical grid is finer than the original grid. 

PPtop Choice    Given the fact that, ultimately, sBLT bases its operation on geometrical 

considerations, it is possible that, for specific types of RH profiles, the BLT determined for the 

FP is at a level not realistic for a boundary layer. Taking this into account, testing has been 

performed to determine a reasonable value for PPtop. For the current sBLT implementation, 

this value has been found to be top = 650 hPa, that is, PP650. Still, since the S! Dp values have 

to be calculated from the analysis of the RHgrad profile as a whole (see PPtop above), in 

sBLT, no portion of the RH profile is discarded from analysis (contrary to JK10, that focused 

solely on the RH information below 700 hPa). Nevertheless, the FP results should always be 

analyzed, and can be potentially valuable to check for model and observational dataset 

deficiencies, namely, for the occurrence of unrealistically deep BLs. 

sBLT versus JK10    It should be stressed that sBLT allows for a straightforward comparison 

of its results with those that would be obtained following JK10. In fact, JK10 is embedded in 

- 93 - 



-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - 

sBLT. Note, however, that JK10 worked in model levels, and that no disambiguation 

procedure was reported in that publication. Another advantage of using sBLT comes from the 

fact that, even in the cases when sBLT and JK10 coincide, sBLT can still give additional 

information, useful to further characterize the BLT and the BL beneath it, namely in what 

concerns its sS# distribution statistic. This statistic is of special interest when comparing 

different spatial and or temporal domains, since it has information on, e.g., the kind of RH 

structure of the boundary layer, most typical in a given season or region. 

sBLT versus Critical-Threshold Methods    As mentioned above, with sBLT, the BLT is 

determined based on geometrical considerations. This seems to impart some robustness to the 

sBLT approach, particularly in the sense that it allows the determination of BLTs for a wider 

range of situations (especially in terms of the humidity content of the BL) than approaches that 

impose specific (typically minimum) thresholds to the vertical gradients of RH and or potential 

temperature (e.g., Martins et al. 2010). 

6.3.2.6 Future developments 

Testing    sBLT is still in its development infancy. There is the need for further testing, 

especially on case studies with carefully chosen RH profiles, for which the sBLT results would 

be compared to the results from alternative RH-based (and other) methods (e.g., Fetzer et al. 

2004, von Engeln et al. 2005, Karlsson et al. 2010). 

Disambiguation Assumptions    It would be important to assess the robustness of the 

assumption that, at the top of the boundary layer, the decrease of RH going up in the vertical is 

such that (locally) the corresponding (underlying [continuous]) RH curve is concave up 

(meaning that the highest decrease rate is found right at the BLT). This issue, first raised above 

at Strongest-S# Disambiguation, could be investigated resorting to fine resolution observation 

of the BLT, e.g., from dedicated radiosonde or satellite observational campaigns. 

S1    In the current sBLT version, except for constant-RH profiles, a BLT is always 

determined, even if the S! out of the basic algorithm is a sS1. This implies that a BLT can be 

found in a profile characterized by a combination of constant-RH layers and layers showing an 

increase in RH with height, a case for which the BLT would end up corresponding to a RH 

increase with height (a situation not thought to be realistic [at least for the typical subtropical 

MBL]). A future development would then be to further constrain the algorithm to determine 

BLTs only for sS2, or above, S! solutions, or, at least, disregard sS1 “BLTs” in the evaluation 

- 94 - 



-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - 

of the BLT Level and BLT Strength statistics, but still storing sS1 situations for supplemental 

information on the RH behaviour in the dataset in question. 

sBLT Statistics    Testing of sBLT results needs also to be done in a statistical framework. 

Development of additional sBLT statistics should be a priority. 

not7.S2    This is an example of a statistic that would be interesting to implement. It is similar 

to the not7.S1 statistic, but with the focus on 7.S2, instead. 

6.3.2.7 Case studies 

Figure 6.6 presents four case studies, chosen to illustrate basic sBLT concepts, and the 

resulting sBLT BLT for specific RH profiles. In Fig. 6.6a, the S profiles are shown for the full 

(bottom to top) and the 700 hPa (bottom to 700 hPa) profiles. Recall that a S profile is obtained 

by locating in the RHgrad profile the levels with the strongest RHgrad for each S# index (S# = 

1). f.S# and 7.S# are then the levels found for the full and the 700 hPa S profiles, respectively. 

Apart from the S profiles, the level for the BLT solution of the basic sBLT algorithm is also 

shown (S!), with an indication of the respective sS# (in light gray).

Figure 6.6 - Four vertical profiles of relative humidity (RH, black lines with open circles [at profile levels]), and 
respective profiles of the vertical gradient of relative humidity (RH grad., gray lines with black crosses [at the mid 
levels of the RH profiles]). The thick solid horizontal color lines indicate particular levels in the RH grad. profiles 

associated with the S# indexes with the same colors (the color shown is the one for the highest S# whenever 
different S#s fall in the same level). The thick black solid and dash lines indicate, respectively, the 700 hPa and 

650 hPa levels (see text for details). 

It is immediately apparent that, for this (Fig. 6.6a) RHgrad profile, the two S profiles differ 

substantially, except for S4, that is the same in both S profiles. Additionally, this same S4 is, 

for both, the solution of the basic algorithm. Note how f.S1, f.S2, and f.S3 coincide at the same

level, and how the thick dry layer below it doesn't allow it to be a S4, or at least, the strongest 

S4 in the full profile (f.S4). Note as well, that 7.S1 does not coincide with 7.S2 for the fact that 

the former corresponds to an increase of RH with height (a positive RHgrad.). As mentioned, 

this 7.S1 is assumed to be the JK10’s solution. But perhaps the most striking thing about the 

case in Fig. 6.6a is the fact that 7.S2, the (mid) level with the strongest RH decrease in the 700 

hPa profile, was not chosen by the basic sBLT algorithm as the BLT solution. This is an 

indication of the robustness of sBLT in being able to detect and manage intermediate dry 

layers (e.g., associated with residual layers, or with dry intrusions). Figure 6.6b, illustrates the 

use of a PP650. The final sBLT solution for this profile is indicated by the light gray thick line, 

sBLT!4. It is then the solution for a PP650 and corresponds to a sS4. Note how 7.S1 would not 

be an adequate BLT for this profile. Figure 6.6c, shows a case for which the sBLT solution is 

above 700 hPa. Finally, in Fig. 6.6d the FP sBLT solution seems unreasonable as a BLT, 

unlike the PP650 sBLT solution, which seems more realistic. For this profile, 7.S1 coincides 

with the sBLT solution, itself a sS4. 

6.3.2.8 Model and analysis results 

The results presented in the next two figures pertain to eight of the GPCI models and to one 

atmospheric analysis dataset (ECMWFan). These results were obtained from the available 3-

hourly records. 

In the left plot in Fig. 6.7, the sBLT BLT Level statistic is presented for models and analysis 

along the GPCI cross section as obtained for the JJA 2003 season. The transect average is also 

given for each model at the C position in the abscissa. The models included here are a subset of 

the models shown in Fig. 5 of JK10 (except for JAMSTEC, that wasn’t included in that study). 

Although the models aren’t individually identified in JK10, it can be said, looking at the model 

spread, that there is, overall, a good agreement between the sBLT results and the findings by 

JK10. All models show: a similar BLT growth rate between 35°N (Sc, ~ 940 hPa model mean) 

and 17°N (shallow cumulus [ShCu], ~ 840 hPa model mean); the ITCZ (8°N) dip (at 14°N in 

GFDL, and inexistent in MétéoFrance); and, higher BLTs to the south of the ITCZ. The 

biggest departure between sBLT and JK10 seems to be, for some of the models, deeper sBLT 

BLs found between 17°N and 20°N (in the trades). For the transect as a whole, NCEP and 

GFDL present the deepest and shallowest BLs, respectively; and, although deeper than 

MétéoFrance in the Sc and ShCu regions, JAMSTEC has a transect average below the former, 

owing to a significant decrease in BLT height south of 17°N. By looking at mean RH sections 

- 97 - 



-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - 

for some of these models, it can be concluded that the dip in BLT height in the ITCZ is 

associated with a very moist surface overlaid by a relatively gentle RH decrease going up in 

the deep convection area. Finally, from the fact that all models tend to show, in these results, 

basically the same (close to constant) growth rate of BLT height, it could also be argued that 

(at least to a first approximation) their Sc BL representation in terms of simulated humidity 

content and BL depth is the main reason behind the departures found downwind in the ShCu 

BLTs.

Figure 6.7 - Mean June-July-August (JJA) 2003 boundary layer top (BLT) pressure (left plot) and strength (right 
plot) along GPCI for eight participating models and ECMWF analysis (ECMWFan), determined using the sBLT 

methodology applied to relative humidity data (see text for details). 

The right plot in Fig. 6.7, presents, for the same models and analysis, the sBLT BLT Strength 

statistic. The results show the ITCZ as the area with the weakest BLT strength, while the 

strongest BLTs are found somewhere between 26°N and 32°N (typically the area where the 

seasonal maxima of Sc are found [Fig. 5.1]). The comparison between the whole-transect 

results in both plots in Fig. 6.7 highlights some interesting differences among the datasets. 

Note, for instance, the case of ECMWFan and MétéoFrance, the two show in the left plot a 

practically coincident BLT in all points in the transect but differ substantially in the transect-

averaged BLT strength with MétéoFrance showing lower values (note the striking departure in 

the Sc areas). Finally, NCAR shows not just one of the lowest BLTs, but also one of the 

weakest. In fact, MétéoFrance and NCAR follow each other very closely in terms of the mean 

BLT strength along the cross section, though NCAR has a lower BLT in any of the transect 

locations. 

The sBLT sS# Distribution and not7.S1 statistics are presented in Fig. 6.8 for the same nine 

datasets.

height (pressure) information (e.g., 

he results in Fig. 6.7 contain information more directly related to BLT characteristics, namely 

and strength, in turn, while showing BLT-related 

“above700hPa” occurrence), Figure 6.8 presents, in addition, results that relate to the humidity 

(RH) characteristics of the BL itself, i.e., the portion of the atmosphere below the BLTs 

determined. The “BLT S hist.” occurrence histograms show how often the different BL types 

occur at each one of the transect locations, and in the cross section as a whole (at C in the 

abscissa). For instance, a sS4 BL is one for which the vertically-averaged RH is equal to, or 

above, the highest of the two RH values used to evaluate the respective BLT strength (see the 

explanations above at S1, S2, S3, and S4 index, and at sS#). The first aspect in the results 

shown is the rare occurrence of sS1 BLs (sS# is in these plots denoted as S#). Only three of the 

models show sS1, essentially in the deep convection area, and with less than ~ 3 % seasonal 

occurrence. A second notorious feature in these results is that sS4 BLs clearly dominate, both 

spatially and temporally, the exception being the JAMSTEC model for which sS4 has, for the 

section as a whole, an occurrence of about 40 %. In this regard, the ITCZ (~ 8°N) is the area 

where sS4 BLs tend to occur less frequently, with five of the nine datasets showing values 

below 50 % seasonal occurrence. Overall, the second most dominant type of BL is sS3 that 

tend to occur more in the ITCZ. Models show important differences in the sS3 representation, 

with JAMSTEC as the only model for which sS3 is the dominant type. In NCEP and UKMO, 

sS3 is as representative as sS2, with the later dominating the deep convection region, the area 

where sS2 occur more frequently in all of the datasets shown. Recall that a sS2 is necessarily 

not a sS3, meaning that the sS2 BL is characterized by the presence of one or more layers of air 

with RH lower than the lowest of the two RH values used to evaluate the respective BLT 

strength. It is noteworthy that, for NCAR and MétéoFrance, sS4 dominates with more than 90 

% occurrence in all of the transect locations. Still, although both models are very similar in 

terms of BLT strength, they differ in BLT height, with MétéoFrance showing deeper BLs, as 

mentioned above. Finally, recall that (only) geometrical considerations are implied in the sS# 

determination, such that, no information on the actual BL humidity content can be directly 

inferred from these results. The BL humidity content can be obtained from the kind of analysis 

presented in Fig. 4.4 (seasonal means of RH). Note, for instance, NCEP and UKMO, with 

practically the same BLT height, and very similar sS# histograms, to the north of 20°N, a 

segment where the two differ the most in BLT strength. This situation is probably associated 

with moister BLs in the UKMO simulations.

Regarding the “BLT vs. 7S1” results, it is evident that it is in the ITCZ that most frequently the 

sBLT solution differs from the 7.S1 BLT (for GFDL the peak value is only ~ 1.5 %). As these 

situations may arise from the simple fact that the sBLT solution falls above 700 hPa, the 

“above700hPa” line indicates how frequently that was the case. The difference between those 

two statistics (the gray segment) thus indicates, for each location in the cross section, the 

percentage of time sBLT didn’t coincide with 7.S1 while being below 700 hPa. Note, for 

instance, that NCEP has, at 14°N, its mean BLT at ~ 810 hPa, well below 700 hPa, though 

having at the same location ~ 40 % occurrence of BLT above 700 hPa. To the north of 17°N 

both the “not7S1” and the “above700hPa” lines are below 10 % in all models except NCEP. 

Finally, note that UKMO has ~ 50 % sS2 occurrence at 8°N, where “not7S1” is ~ 80 %. This 

means that, at 8°N, for at least ~ 30 % of the time, an sS2 is not 7.S1. This can only occur in 

two different situations: 7.S1 is a sS1, i.e., an increase of RH with height; or, the level that 

initiated the basic algorithm was at least a S3, and was located below a 7.S1 that was, 

simultaneously, at least a S2. Only a not7.S2 sBLT statistic would allow a more definite 

answer in these cases. 

6.3.2.9 Summertime statistics from daily AIRS data 

The sBLT results for the JJA 2003 daily AIRS data are presented in Fig. 6.9. 

For this AIRS dataset, no sS1 BLs have been determined, and the highest occurrence value for 

either sS2, or sS3 BLs is below 10 % (see the ITCZ area), meaning that sS4 BLs dominate, 

with more than 95 % occurrence in the cross section as a whole. This is an indication of 

consistently moist BLs, in the sense that the presence of intermediate dry layers is probably 

rare. This fact may also arise from the relatively coarse vertical resolution of the dataset in 

question. The models that most resemble these observations in terms of the type of BL most 

represented are NCAR and MétéoFrance. Note that the AIRS BLTs are rarely not at the level 

corresponding to 7.S1. BLTs above 700 hPa are also rare with a ~ 4 % occurrence in the deep 

convection area, and an isolated peak of ~ 1 % at 23°N. At about 0.46 %/hPa, the AIRS 

transect-averaged BLT strength is well below the value for most of the models (the minimum 

model value is ~ 0.65 %/hPa [MétéoFrance]). The seasonal mean BLT height along the cross 

section compares very well with JK10 (apart from a lower sBLT at 35°N ~ 950 hPa [~ 925 hPa 

in JK10]).

Figure 6.9 - Mean June-July-August (JJA) 2003 boundary layer top (BLT) pressure (top row left plot) and 

strength (top row right plot), together with the sS# Distribution (BLT S hist.) and not7.S1 (BLT vs. 7S1), statistics 
determined along GPCI using the sBLT methodology applied to AIRS relative humidity data (see text for details). 

To close the section, and thinking about possible avenues for future applications of sBLT, first 

of all, it would be of interest to extend the kind of analysis proposed above to the broader 

domain of the NE Pacific, and even to the global oceanic (sub)tropical regions. Other seasons 

should also be investigated especially for a study of the spatiotemporal behaviour of the sBLT 

statistics. In particular, the sS# Distribution statistic could be used to composite BLT Level and 

BLT Strength for each one of the sS#. This compositing approach could also be tried for other 

key parameters such as BL moisture content, proxies for the large-scale dynamics, 

environmental conditions, cloud behaviour, and cloud-regime transition characteristics. 

6.3.3 Cloud cover transitions 

As mentioned, this section revisits the topic of abrupt transitions in cloud cover along the GPCI 

transect. Section 6.3.3.1 introduces a new methodology for the location of discontinuities in the 

cloud fields, a follow up of the technique presented in Section 5.1.3 (Sharp gradients), 

implemented constraining the definition of an abrupt cloud cover change. The results for the 

- 102 - 



-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - 

cloud transition statistics (e.g., histograms of their location), are presented in the closing 

section, along with seasonal mean relative humidity profiles spatially averaged upwind and 

downwind of the transition locations determined from JJA 2003 3-hourly model and analysis 

data. 

6.3.3.1 An updated version of the analysis of abrupt changes in cloud cover 

Since the focus is now exclusively on subtropical cloud transitions, the analysis proposed here 

is limited to the segment of the GPCI transect comprised between 14°N and 35°N, that is, an 

area encompassing solely the ShCu and Sc domains. Recall that the results presented in 

Section 5.1.3 were obtained along the whole span of the section, thus including the deep 

convection area and the latitudes south of the ITCZ. 

The new method comprises these steps: (i) determination of the location of the strongest 

(greater-than or equal to 30 %) southward decrease in TCC, calculated between two adjacent 

transect locations (as with the previous method, the TCC transition location is assigned to the 

position to the north, among the two adjacent transect locations used to calculate the TCC 

decrease [i.e., the one from where the TCC drops], furthermore, if two or more locations share 

the same strongest TCC decrease value, the one most to the south is chosen); (ii) check if all 

the TCC values to the north of the location determined in (i) (including the TCC value at the 

transition location), are above the average TCC calculated in the domain south of the transition 

location; (iii) if that is the case, verify if the average TCC for the domain north of the transition 

location (calculated including the TCC value at the transition location) is above the average 

TCC to the south of the transition location by at least 30 %. Only if all these conditions are met 

a TCC transition is said to occur. This is performed for each one of the TCC records available 

3-hourly. Finally, the values for the seasonal mean TCC of the abrupt transition are obtained 

for the extreme north and south locations in the transect, respectively, from the means of all the 

TCC averages obtained for the north of and south sides of the transition locations. The mean 

location of the transition, is the mean of all the locations found in the 3-hourly data. 

Histograms of the transition location are computed as well. 

That said, it is now clear that the mean TCC difference between the north and south domains 

will always be at least 30 %. This wasn’t the case for the “old” method (Section 5.1.3), that 

could, potentially, result in a TCC difference between the two domains lower than the 

threshold used to identify the abrupt decrease in TCC, or even in a mean south-side TCC 

average higher than the mean north-side TCC average.

6.3.3.2 Relative humidity signature of sharp gradients in cloud cover 

Contemporaneous with the calculation of the TCC averages for the north of and south sides of 

the transition locations found following the method described in the previous section, was the 

evaluation, for each one of the 3-hourly records with a TCC transition determined, of the 

respective spatially-averaged profiles of relative humidity. Figure 6.10 shows the JJA 2003 

seasonal results for both the TCC transitions (occurrence, mean location, mean north and south 

TCC averages, and histograms of transition location) and the corresponding mean RH profiles 

for the north and south sides of the abrupt southward decreases in the TCC parameter. 

Starting with the seasonal occurrence of abrupt TCC changes, it is evident that the values are, 

for the new method, and for all the datasets, much lower than those obtained previously, shown 

in Fig. 5.4 (for JJA 1998). This is the case, even taking into account only the transect segment 

between 14°N and 35°N. The occurrence values drop from above 90 % to values typically 

below 25 %, and indication of the robustness of the new method in constraining the model 

results to the situations with a spatially consistent cloud-regime transition. The UKMO model 

stands out from the rest with a an occurrence value of ~ 64 %, a feature probably associated 

with the peculiarity of its boundary layer cloud parameterization (see the discussion in Section 

5.1.2). The histograms of the transition location are quite different among these datasets, with 

the main peaks found either close to 14°N, or at 35°N. The mean location for the transition 

falls between ~ 23°N (NCAR) and ~ 29°N (ECMWFan). The seasonal mean value of the TCC 

to the north of the transition locations found during the season is typically above 80 % (~ 100 

% in GFDL), while the value to the south is ~ 40 % (below 30 % for BMRC and UKMO). 

Regarding the RH profiles, these can be seen as representing the typical Sc (North) and ShCu 

(South) RH profiles, at least, for these sharp decreases in TCC. As expected, the ShCu show a 

deeper BL, with mean (vertically-averaged) BL RHs as high as, or even above, those found in 

the Sc BL. Close to the surface, both cloud regimes have similar RH values, with the 

maximum at the surface for the Sc, while for the ShCu the BL peak RH is above the surface, 

somewhere between 960 hPa and 920 hPa. It is above ~ 600 hPa that the biggest differences 

are found among the models in the comparison between the respective ShCu and Sc RH 

profiles. Between ~ 600 hPa and ~ 250 hPa, overall similar ShCu and Sc RH profiles are seen 

for ECMWFan, UKMO, and NCAR; consistently lower Sc RH characterizes ECMWF; and 

substantially higher Sc RH is found in the BMRC, and MétéoFrance models. The highest 

overall similarity between the Sc and ShCu RH profiles is found in the ECMWF and 

- 104 - 



-    Examination of relative humidity and cloud cover changes    - 

ECMWFan datasets, which are also similar in the TCC transition statistics, except in terms of 

occurrence (ECMWF ~ 37 %, ECMWFan ~ 24 %). 

This kind of investigation on the potential impacts of the tropospheric humidity structure on 

the (sub)tropical cloud regime transitions seems necessary to better constrain the models’ 

boundary layer cloud behaviour. While there is the need for more observational insight on this 

(e.g., Sandu et al. 2010), extending the approach proposed above to analyze numerical 

simulations seems timely. A number of ideas in that direction conclude this section and 

chapter, namely: 1) find, additionally, the seasonal means of the RH profiles at the transition 

location, and just south of it, instead of averaging all the RH profiles in the domains to the 

north and to the south of the transitions; 2) perform these two types of analysis [in Fig. 6.10 

and proposed in point 1)] individually for each location along the cross section, as a way to 

infer (for each model) any variations in how the Sc and ShCu RH profiles compare when the 

transitions occur later (more to the south) or earlier (more to the north) along the transect (the 

models should then be intercompared in this respect); 3) add to all these investigations, 

information on important parameters, such as, sea surface temperature, low tropospheric 

stability, proxies for the large-scale dynamics, low level winds, among others; 4) also, a 

comparison between the seasonal mean RH field for the 14°N-to-35°N segment of the GPCI 

cross section, and the mean RH fields for the same segment, composited separately for those 

times when the TCC transition falls in specific transect locations, could be tried (this would 

allow a broader view of the RH field, as opposed to looking at individual RH profiles).

7 Diurnal oscillations in the models and in observations 

Another important topic for GPCI is the representation, in weather and climate prediction 

models, of the diurnal variation of clouds and cloud-related parameters. As mentioned in 

Chapter 3 (The GPCI project), GPCI can be seen as a follow-up of the EUROCS (European 

Cloud Systems Study) climate model intercomparison, most notably in the much higher (3-

hourly) temporal resolution of the requested model output and observational datasets. The 3-

hourly model and satellite data have proven crucial in the characterization of the regional 

climatology of clouds, boundary layer, and large-scale dynamics and environmental 

conditions, done in previous chapters resorting to a number of traditional approaches and new 

methodologies, not possible with lower temporal resolution datasets (e.g., the cloud transition 

analysis, or the boundary layer statistics). In this chapter the focus is more specifically on the 

diurnal cycle, as seen in seasonal means at different locations along the GPCI cross section. 

Because, in the (sub)tropical NE Pacific the diurnal cycle presents its peak amplitude during 

the summertime, the data available for June-July-August (JJA) should prove useful for the 

preliminary evaluation of models and observations proposed in the next sections. 

7.1 Seasonal mean characteristics 

7.1.1 Atmospheric circulation 

In an attempt to characterize mean diurnal changes in the large-scale dynamics associated with 

the Hadley circulation in the NE Pacific, models and reanalysis (ERA-40 [ECMWF 40 Year 

Re-analysis]) data for vertical velocity at 700 hPa (w700), and 1000 hPa -to- 850 hPa vertically 

averaged horizontal wind direction (defined as to where the wind is blowing to, and reported in 

degrees clockwise from North) and speed, were obtained for JJA 1998 at 8 different times 

during the day, for each one of the 13 locations along GPCI. The corresponding mean results, 

presented in Fig. 7.1, show: a discernible diurnal cycle of w700 in the ITCZ (Inter-Tropical 

Convergence Zone, 8°N), in ERA-40, and in the ECMWF and NCAR models, with minimum 

values between 6 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) and 9 UTC (approximately between 7 

pm and 10 pm, local solar time [LST]); a relative minimum in subsidence in the trades and 

subtropics (to the north of ~ 17°N) between 9 UTC and 15 UTC (at 26°N, 12 UTC ~ 3 am 

LST) in ECMWF and NCAR (3 hours earlier in GFDL); practically imperceptible diurnal

-    Diurnal oscillations in the models and in observations    - 

cycle in UKMO at any of the locations in the transect; an overall tendency for the trade winds 

(17°N to 23°N) to blow slightly more to the south between 3 UTC and 9 UTC (between ~ 5:30 

pm and ~ 11:30 pm LST, at 20°N); also the period of the day when the winds are stronger 

generally to the north of 11°N (e.g., ERA-40).

Figure 7.1 - For four of the participating models and ERA-40 reanalysis, June-July-August 1998 mean diurnal 
cycle of vertical velocity at 700 hPa (w700, top row), and horizontal wind direction (to where the wind is blowing 
to, in degrees clockwise from North, mid row) and speed (bottom row) vertically averaged in the 1000 hPa to 850 
hPa layer, all at each one of the 13 locations along GPCI, and for 8 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) 3-hourly 

during the day. 

7.1.2 Full-profile parameters 

The JJA 1998 mean diurnal cycle for three vertically distributed cloud-related variables is 

presented in Fig. 7.2, Fig. 7.3, and Fig. 7.4, for four participating models and ERA-40 

reanalysis, and at three different locations in the GPCI cross section, respectively, the ITCZ 

(8°N), the shallow cumulus area (ShCu, 20°N), and the stratocumulus area (Sc, 32°N). The 

three variables are: relative humidity (RH), cloud fraction (CF), and cloud liquid water content 

(CLW). 

In terms of the ITCZ RH, two models (GFDL, and UKMO [and to some extent NCAR]) show 

a moistening of the layer below 700 hPa that peaks around 15 UTC (~ 4 am LST). Those same 

models do not show any significant RH variations during the day in the ShCu, where, in turn,

-    Diurnal oscillations in the models and in observations    - 

ECMWF and ERA-40 show a slight moistening of the boundary layer (up to 900 hPa) between 

12 UTC and 18 UTC (15 UTC ~ 5:30 am LST, at 20°N). For the Sc areas,  a slight increase in 

RH close to the top of the boundary layer (see Fig. 6.7 for JJA 2003 mean boundary layer 

heights) is perceptible in NCAR between 12 UTC and 18 UTC (between ~ 3:30 am LST and ~ 

9:30 am LST), while in ERA-40 the same period is characterized by a moistening of the 

boundary layer itself. Except maybe for ERA-40 in the ITCZ, and ECMWF in the ShCu, no 

significant changes in mid tropospheric (700 hPa to 400 hPa) humidity can be reported (in the 

Sc in NCAR there is a slight thickening of the dry layer [~ 600 hPa], with a peak about 9 hours 

prior to the peak in RH at the top of the boundary layer). 

   ECMWF rel. humidity (%)    GFDL rel. humidity (%)    NCAR rel. humidity (%)    UKMO rel. humidity (%)    ERA40 rel. humidity (%)

 

Figure 7.2 - For four of the participating models and ERA-40 reanalysis, June-July-August 1998 mean diurnal 
cycle of vertically distributed relative humidity (top row), cloud fraction (mid row), and cloud liquid water 

content (bottom row), for the  Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ, 8°N) location in the GPCI transect, and 
for 8 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) 3-hourly during the day. 

In what concerns the CF and CLW parameters, in the ITCZ, and for all the datasets shown, 

below ~ 600 hPa, RH and CF seem to, to some extent, be correlated along the diurnal cycle. 

However, there are discrepancies in the UTC location of the relative maximums in CF, with a 

peak CF somewhere between 12 UTC and 15 UTC in GFDL, UKMO, and NCAR, precisely 

the period when ECMWF and ERA-40 show minimum values of CF. There is, overall, a good 

temporal agreement between the peak values of CF and CLW in ECMWF, ERA-40, and 

GFDL, contrary to the situation in UKMO, and, especially, NCAR (see the layer between 900 

hPa and 700 hPa).

-    Diurnal oscillations in the models and in observations    - 

In the ShCu, most of the CF reported is below 800 hPa, and thus most probably associated with 

the boundary layer (Fig. 6.7). No specific relation is perceptible in ECMWF and GFDL 

between the diurnal variations of RH and CF. This is not the case in UKMO and ERA-40, that 

show a positive correlation between the two, with a peak in CF around 15 UTC. In NCAR, the 

maximum in CF between 6 UTC and 9 UTC happens ~ 3 hours earlier than a slight moistening 

of the lowest levels in the boundary layer. For the ShCu there is in all datasets a good 

agreement between CF and CLW, a situation still valid in the Sc areas. 

Finally, the Sc results for NCAR show that the slight increase in RH close to the top of the 

boundary layer, between 12 UTC and 18 UTC, is accompanied by higher CF values, especially 

at the levels just above a very shallow boundary layer CF maximum. Also, the upper CF 

maximum happens ~ 3 hours later than the low-level maximum in CF. Note, however, that 

most CF simulated above 900 hPa doesn't have any CLW. 

7.1.3 Diurnal anomalies from single-level variables 

JJA 1998 mean diurnal cycle anomalies are analyzed in this section obtained from model 

simulations, ERA-40 reanalysis, and observations from ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud 

Climatology Project) and TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission). The results are given 

for three locations in the GPCI cross section, namely, one in the ITCZ (8°N), one in the ShCu 

area (20°N), and one in the Sc area (32°N). Three variables were chosen for analysis: low 

tropospheric stability (LTS), total cloud cover (TCC), and precipitation (P). The results are 

presented in Fig. 7.5. 

Briefly, the precipitation observations used here, were extracted from the TRMM 3B42 

precipitation rate product (Huffman et al. 2007), a 3-hourly, 0.25° × 0.25°, global (50°S to 

50°N) dataset, covering the period from December 1997 to the present. 3B42 is obtained at 

fine intervals with the TRMM Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) combining 

microwave sensor precipitation estimates. Where unavailable, those estimates are substituted 

by infrared (IR) estimates from geostationary IR observations. These data are available online 

at the Goddard Earth Sciences Data &amp;amp; Information Service Center (GES-DISC). 

The LTS variable (defined as the difference between the potential temperature at 700 hPa and 

at the surface), shows for all models and at any of the three locations along the GPCI transect, 

very similar mean diurnal variation behaviour, both in terms of amplitude and phase, with daily 

maxima typically found between 3 UTC and 6 UTC, and minima between 15 UTC and 21 

- 111 - 



-    Diurnal oscillations in the models and in observations    - 

UTC in the ITCZ, and 3 hours (UTC) earlier in the ShCu and Sc areas. ECMWF is the model 

with the least diurnal amplitude in the ITCZ, while showing in the other two regions, similar 

values as compared to the other datasets. The GFDL model shows, in all regions, the maximum 

and minimum LTS values shifted 3 hours earlier from the rest. No other variable shows this 

overall high degree of (intra-, and inter-model) diurnal coherence between the various regions.

Figure 7.5 - For four of the participating models, ERA-40 reanalysis, ISCCP observations, and TRMM estimates, 
June-July-August 1998 mean diurnal cycle anomalies of low tropospheric stability (LTS), total cloud cover 

(TCC), and precipitation (P), obtained in three different areas along GPCI (Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone 
[ITCZ, 8°N], shallow cumulus [ShCu, 20°N], stratocumulus [Sc, 32°N]), and for 8 UTC (Universal Time 

Coordinated) 3-hourly during the day. 

ISCCP's TCC in the ITCZ shows two relative maxima, the most pronounced being the one at 3 

UTC (~ 4 pm LST), and a secondary one at 18 UTC (~ 7 am LST). The other datasets show 

two (or even three [ERA-40]) TCC peaks during the day, with the most pronounced peak in the 

early morning, instead of during the afternoon, as in ISCCP. In the ShCu and Sc areas the 

general tendency is for a single TCC cycle. ISCCP shows in the ShCu the biggest diurnal 

amplitude in TCC. The ISCCP maximum in the ShCu is centered at 12 UTC (~ 2:20 am LST).

NCAR has the ShCu peak (too early) between 6 UTC and 9 UTC, ECMWF, UKMO and ERA-

40 show it ~ 3 hours later than ISCCP, and GFDL is, overall, the model that best follows 

ISCCP, both in phase and in amplitude (the other models lack in ShCu amplitude). It is in the 

Sc that ISCCP has the least diurnal variation in TCC, with models showing larger values in this 

respect (particularly GFDL with a diurnal amplitude as large as in the ShCu). Overall, there is, 

in the Sc, a better agreement between the datasets in the location of the daily maximum in 

TCC: 18 UTC (~ 9:30 am LST) in ISCCP, and ECMWF; 21 UTC (~ 12:30 pm LST) in ERA-

40; and between 12 UTC (~ 3:30 am LST) and 15 UTC (~ 6:30 am LST) in UKMO, NCAR, 

and GFDL. 

In terms of precipitation rate (ECMWF is not shown), most datasets show a (single) diurnal 

peak sometime between 12 UTC and 18 UTC at any of the three locations along the transect 

(about 3 hours earlier in the ShCu and Sc for GFDL). In the ITCZ, all datasets lack in diurnal 

amplitude as compared to TRMM, and, except for NCAR, are not in phase with the 

observations, showing the peak precipitation 3 hours earlier than TRMM. In general, the 

datasets are more in phase with TRMM in the Sc, although showing higher diurnal amplitudes. 

In the ShCu, TRMM has a principal peak t 21 UTC, and a secondary one between 12 UTC and 

15 UTC. No other dataset has more than one precipitation peak in the ShCu (or at any of the 

other positions). 

A final note about the Sc results, to highlight that, except between 0 UTC (~ 3:30 pm LST) and 

6 UTC (~ 9:30 pm LST) for UKMO and NCAR, the diurnal evolution in TCC is basically out 

of phase with the diurnal variation in LTS. In fact, the peak TCC is found at a time close to the 

lowest diurnal value of LTS in practically all models and ERA-40. Assuming that TCC in the 

Sc is essentially associated with low level (boundary layer) stratiform cloudiness (see the cloud 

fraction results in Fig. 7.4), and looking more specifically at the NCAR results, a model that (at 

least in this version) is known to link this type of subtropical clouds to LTS (see the discussion 

in Section 5.1.2), it could be inferred that the Sc response to LTS is dependent, not only on the 

time of the day, but also (or perhaps, above all) on the (in this case) TCC value, that is, the 

(positive) cloud response to LTS is most effective for the lowest TCC values in the diurnal 

cycle (at 0 UTC in NCAR). Then, once the (increasing) cloud amount reaches a certain 

threshold (at 6 UTC in NCAR) the Sc become less sensitive to (the decreasing) static stability 

of the environment (that, for NCAR, happens between 6 UTC and 15 UTC), showing what 

could be called “Scinertia” (for “stratocumulus inertia”), i.e., a certain degree of inertia in the 

response to LTS (as mentioned, the TCC maximum in the Sc happens, for NCAR, between ~ 

- 113 - 



-    Diurnal oscillations in the models and in observations    - 

3:30 am and ~ 6:30 am, LST, the later being the time when LTS is at its minimum). Naturally, 

other parameters should be taken into consideration in this type of analysis (e.g., to what 

degree “Scinertia” is related to the humidity structure of the free/mid troposphere?). Answers 

to some of these questions should be found in high spatiotemporal resolution observational and 

modelling efforts targeted at the subtropical Sc regime. 

It is apparent that models differ from each other, and from ERA-40, ISCCP, and TRMM, 

mostly in TCC and precipitation, and particularly in the deep convection and trade wind 

regions. Given that there is an indication (both observational and modelling) that diurnal-scale 

processes can have an impact on phenomena occurring on longer time scales, these 

discrepancies should be given more attention by the climate prediction community, especially 

being the diurnal cycle the most distinct (forced) mode of variability in the atmosphere.

8 Summary and conclusions 

Notwithstanding the considerable improvement in cloud parameterization in the last 20 years, 

the representation of clouds is still a challenge for the weather and climate modelling 

communities. The urgency for the development of cloud parameterization in GCMs (General 

Circulation Models) is reinforced by the fact that the amount of cloud generated by the models 

has a significant impact on the predicted behaviour of the climate system. In particular, current 

climate models tend to respond differently in climate change sensitivity experiments. 

Parameterization deficiencies also result in thermodynamically inconsistent representation of 

the hydrologic cycle., with important implications in the simulation of the (sub)tropical 

atmospheric circulation. These topics are investigated by different GCSS (Global energy and 

water cycle experiment Cloud System Study) working groups, whose strategy has been 

successful in defining and understanding fundamental cloud regimes, and in developing, and 

improving cloud parameterizations. However, the exclusive use of one-dimensional versions of 

atmospheric models, as traditionally done in GCSS, does not allow a deep understanding of the 

fundamental role of clouds in climate, which implies that parameterization testing has to be 

done in the complete (3D) GCMs, a task that potentially entails the analysis of very large 

amounts of model simulation data. 

In this context, the GPCI (GCSS / working group on numerical experimentation Pacific Cross-

section Intercomparison) project offers a new and much lighter approach for the 

intercomparison of GCMs, by focusing the analysis on a reduced number of locations along a 

cross section, allowing for a relatively straightforward model and observational data 

integration. GPCI has been focused on the (sub)tropical NE Pacific ocean, and developed a 

framework specifically targeted at the investigation of fundamental cloud regimes that 

typically occur over the eastern boundaries of the (sub)tropical oceans, namely, stratocumulus, 

shallow cumulus, deep cumulus, and the transitions between them. Knowledge gained from a 

detailed analysis of the behaviour of these cloud systems, and associated dynamical and 

thermodynamical environments, in high temporal resolution data from weather and climate 

prediction models and from observations, should offer insight for the improvement and 

development of new parameterizations of clouds, boundary layer, and convection. Having been 

developed in tight connection with the GPCI project, the investigation presented in this thesis 

was oriented along the lines of GPCI’s main goals and scientific questions. 

- 115 - 



-    Summary and conclusions    - 

GPCI can be seen as a level-2 model intercomparison project, in which all the participating 

models have to follow the same line of predefined project specifications and protocols. The 

basic condition imposed is that models run in climate mode and using prescribed sea surface 

temperatures as boundary condition. The period of interest is the June-July-August (JJA) 

season. The focus geographical domain ranges from -5ºN to 45ºN and 160ºE to 240ºE, and 

encompasses 13 locations along the a cross section. The simulation results were requested in a 

3-hourly temporal resolution for a number of variables, either as vertical profiles, or single-

level variables. Over twenty weather and climate prediction organizations have joined the 

effort, and an extensive amount of satellite data has been prepared for GPCI. Analysis of 

model and reanalysis data suggest that it is possible to study the main features associated with 

the cloud phenomenology resorting only to an individual cross section aligned with the 

atmospheric circulation associated with the regional thermally-direct Hadley cell. 

A preliminary analysis of GPCI model and observational data, with the goal to give an 

overview of the mean characteristics of the summertime atmospheric hydrologic cycle in the 

(sub)tropical NE Pacific, has been performed with an emphasis on the vertical distribution of 

clouds, and on processes involving dynamical and environmental factors that play a role in the 

maintenance of total and low cloud fields on a seasonal time scale. The seasonal mean results 

for most variables (e.g., total cloud cover, liquid water path, and outgoing longwave radiation) 

tend to be characterized by a high degree of scatter among the simulations, with models rarely 

showing good agreement with the observations in all of the transect locations. Mean profiles of 

vertical velocity, and relative humidity, suggest that the basic features associated with the 

regional Hadley circulation are, overall, well represented, though, in detail, substantial 

differences exist between the models (e.g., in the strength of the deep convection, or humidity 

content in the boundary layer). A comparison of the vertical distribution of cloud fraction 

highlighted the challenges in the parameterization and simulation of clouds in climate models, 

with simulations showing a variety of behaviours in the representation of the different cloud 

types (e.g., too low stratocumulus clouds) and transitions between them (e.g., presence of 

distinct cloud layers in the transition areas), these results were validated against observations of 

cloud occurrence from the CloudSat and CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared 

Pathfinder Satellite Observations) satellites. Process-oriented studies indicate, overall, a 

noticeable response of the large-scale circulation to change in the prescribed sea surface 

temperatures in all of the models. The responses of other variables such as net shortwave 

radiation at the top of the atmosphere, and total cloud cover, are even more striking, and vary 

- 116 - 



-    Summary and conclusions    - 

from model to model. The fact that the general response to the increase in sea surface 

temperature is not always coherent among the different variables for a given model, points out 

to the need to better constrain the simulated behaviour of important cloud-related parameters, 

including those crucial for the evaluation of cloud radiative forcing. No obvious relation 

between low clouds in the stratocumulus and shallow cumulus regimes, and subsidence and sea 

surface temperature (or low tropospheric stability) has been found in 3-hourly model data for 

the JJA 1998 season. 

An in-depth analysis of convective regime transition, based on the spatiotemporal behaviour of 

clouds, was performed resorting to cloud data from model simulations, atmospheric reanalysis, 

and satellite observations. To gain insight into the question of the transition in (sub)tropical 

cloud regimes, several techniques were developed to detect the transitions, and or summarize 

their main seasonal features. Probability density functions of total cloud cover along the GPCI 

transect, obtained from JJA 1998 3-hourly data, are different for the various models, presenting 

important departures even in locations where the models show practically the same mean total 

cloud cover. Two very distinct stratocumulus -to- shallow cumulus transitions could be 

identified (a relatively smooth southward evolution, and a more abrupt one with a bimodal 

character) and associated with two distinct parameterization approaches. None of the two 

model behaviours (or parameterizations) reproduces well the observed pattern seen in 

corresponding ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) observations. Cloud 

cover statistics from a methodology based on the identification of large gradients of total cloud 

cover along the cross section show a diversity of behaviours among the models, for instance, in 

the mean cloud cover decrease, in their seasonal frequency of occurrence, or in the histograms 

of the location of the transition (ISCCP and reanalysis differ as well). Additionally, a 

preliminary spectral analysis of the seasonal record of spatial shifts in the location of these 

sharp gradients in cloud cover was performed. No outstanding peaks were found in the 

corresponding spectra, being the differences in the temporal evolution of the underlying record 

what mostly distinguished the models (e.g., the tendency for the abrupt transitions to occur 

more to the north of the transect toward the end of the JJA season, or the small amplitude in the 

location change). In terms of the evolution of clout-top height along the section, the model 

ensemble compared well with the analysis product used, though, especially south of the 

stratocumulus areas, all results departed from corresponding MISR (Multiangle Imaging 

Spectroradiometer) observations. Still in the context of cloud regime transition, a grade-based 

approach to clustering of spatial patterns was introduced (GEPAT [Grade-based Empirical 

- 117 - 



-    Summary and conclusions    - 

Pattern Analysis Technique]), and subsequently applied to total cloud cover along the cross 

section, with the final goal to indentify main spatiotemporal features of the seasonal cloud 

cover, and compare associated environmental conditions. Six different cloud-field patterns for 

JJA 1998, with different seasonal representativeness, were analyzed in terms of the respective 

means of vertical velocity at 700 hPa, liquid water path, sea surface temperature, low 

tropospheric stability, and wind direction and speed. Noteworthy differences were found 

mostly in the characteristics of the vertical velocity, and liquid water path fields. A few ideas 

for a future application of the technique include: the analysis of other seasons and years 

(separately or in combination); a comparison of results for different regions; and a more direct 

use of purely observational data. 

The humidity structure in the GPCI region was given special attention, with the goal to better 

understand its role as one of the main parameters in the context of the hydrologic cycle, 

particularly through its influence on cloud formation and evolution. State-of-the-art satellite 

observations from AIRS (Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder) were analyzed along the cross 

section, together with model simulations and atmospheric analyses. A number of results, based 

on the treatment of relative humidity data for the summer season, were analyzed, namely, 

seasonal mean profiles, variance, and temporal evolution. The comparison with the AIRS 

seasonal mean relative humidity showed significant biases in the models (e.g., important 

negative bias in the lowest portion of the boundary layer, a positive bias in the tropopause 

layer, and a generally drier subtropical mid troposphere). In terms of standard deviation, 

although models show, overall, higher relative humidity variability, there is a lack of 

variability in the boundary layer along the entire cross section. A positive bias just above the 

boundary layer north of the trades, is argued to be probably associated with the relatively poor 

vertical resolution of the AIRS dataset used (more so than a model deficiency). The temporal 

evolution of the vertical distribution of relative humidity seems to point out to the need to 

include in the investigation of the stratocumulus –to- shallow cumulus transition, the influence, 

not just of the humidity structure in the free troposphere immediately above the boundary 

layer, but also of the humidity profile all the way to the upper troposphere. Regarding, more 

specifically, the humidity structure of the lower troposphere, a new methodology for the 

determination of the top of the maritime boundary layer was introduced (sBLT [sequential 

Boundary-Layer-Top determination scheme]). The results seem promising, especially for its 

broad applicability, and given that it permits a characterization of the boundary layer (top) not 

offered in other such methodologies. Seasonal mean boundary-layer-top height and strength 

- 118 - 



-    Summary and conclusions    - 

were analyzed for models and analysis along the GPCI cross section, showing considerable 

spread, except in the (practically common) rate of southward deepening of the boundary layer. 

The deep convection and the stratocumulus areas, present, respectively, the least, and the most 

well defined boundary layer tops. Following the sBLT classification, different seasonal 

distributions of the representativeness of the main boundary layer types, were found among 

models and for different locations along the transect. In this respect, only two of the models 

compared well with AIRS. An updated version of the technique to detect abrupt spatial 

changes in the cloud fields along the cross section was developed. It seemed more robust in 

constraining the model results to the situations with a spatially consistent cloud-regime 

transition. Much lower occurrence of the transitions was reported with the new technique, with 

big differences among the models (unlike the corresponding results for the previous version of 

the technique). It allowed for a better understanding of the impact of distinct cloud 

parameterization approaches on regime transition behaviour. Finally, relative humidity profiles 

composited for the two cloud regimes separated by the transition locations identified, showed 

marked differences between the two regimes for a given model, with the biggest differences 

among the models, found in the mid and upper troposphere. Concrete ways to extend the 

investigation of the potential impacts of the tropospheric humidity structure on the 

(sub)tropical cloud regime transitions were proposed. 

As one of the main topics in GPCI, the representation, in weather and climate prediction 

models, of the diurnal variation of clouds and cloud-related parameters, was analyzed resorting 

to 3-hourly model output and observational data. The seasonal mean diurnal cycle was 

characterized for different locations along the GPCI transect. Results were presented for: 

atmospheric circulation associated with the large-scale dynamics in the Hadley-cell-dominated 

NE Pacific; a number of cloud-related vertically-distributed variables; and for JJA mean 

diurnal cycle anomalies at three specific locations in the cross section, representative of the 

main cloud/convection regimes found in the region. A discernible diurnal cycle of vertical 

velocity at 700 hPa could be identified in the inter-tropical convergence zone in reanalysis 

data, and in some of the models (weaker diurnal variations were also found in the trades and 

subtropics). One of the models showed practically no diurnal variation of this parameter at any 

of the locations in the transect. Wind intensity and direction also showed characteristic diurnal 

change. Vertically-distributed relative humidity, cloud fraction, and cloud liquid water content 

results, showed, some diurnal variability in all of the datasets, particularly in the deep 

convection areas and below 600 hPa. Models do not agree in the time of the diurnal maxima of 

- 119 - 



-    Summary and conclusions    - 

these variables. Temporal correspondence between cloud fraction and cloud liquid water 

content is, overall, better constrained in the shallow cumulus and stratocumulus areas than in 

the inter-tropical convergence zone. There is, in the subtropics in one of the models, cloud 

fraction reported in the boundary layer without any associated cloud liquid water content. As 

for mean diurnal anomalies of low tropospheric stability, total cloud cover, and precipitation 

(with precipitation rate observations from TRMM [Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission]), 

models tend to agree well in the first parameter, but differ from each other and the observations 

in the other two (e.g., in the deep convection region ISCCP's total cloud cover shows two 

relative maxima, the most pronounced happening at ~ 4 pm, local solar time, while the other 

datasets tend to have the most pronounced peak in the early morning). In the stratocumulus 

ISCCP has the least diurnal variation in total cloud cover, being, in this respect, surpassed by 

the models. Overall, there is, in the stratocumulus, a better agreement between the datasets in 

the location of the daily maximum in total cloud cover. Concerning the precipitation rate, most 

datasets show a relatively well defined peak in all of the locations along the transect, but lack 

in diurnal amplitude in the deep convection area (as compared to TRMM). Finally, the link 

between stratocumulus and low tropospheric stability was discussed for a particular model 

known to bind the two, and led to the argument of the existence of a certain degree of “inertia” 

in the response of subtropical cloud cover to low tropospheric stability changes during the 

diurnal cycle.  Also, since the (positive) cloud response to the stability of the environment 

seemed to be most effective only when total cloud cover was at its lowest values in the diurnal 

cycle, a possible dependence of the response on cloud amount was inferred. To what degree 

“Scinertia” (for “stratocumulus inertia”) would be related to the humidity structure of the 

free/mid troposphere, was a question left for future research. 

To conclude, two points. First, this work shows well how current weather and climate 

prediction models still suffer from deficiencies in the representation of clouds and cloud-

related processes. Second, the GPCI framework proved useful, in the characterization of main 

model shortcomings, and in helping envision possible avenues for future investigation, both on 

the modelling side and on the observational front.

ABSTRACT


A model evaluation approach is proposed in which weather and climate prediction models are analyzed


along a Pacific Ocean cross section, from the stratocumulus regions off the coast of California, across the


shallow convection dominated trade winds, to the deep convection regions of the ITCZ—the Global Energy


and Water Cycle Experiment Cloud System Study/Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (GCSS/


WGNE) Pacific Cross-Section Intercomparison (GPCI). The main goal of GPCI is to evaluate and help


understand and improve the representation of tropical and subtropical cloud processes in weather and climate


prediction models. In this paper, a detailed analysis of cloud regime transitions along the cross section from


the subtropics to the tropics for the season June–July–August of 1998 is presented. This GPCI study confirms


many of the typical weather and climate prediction model problems in the representation of clouds: un-


derestimation of clouds in the stratocumulus regime by most models with the corresponding consequences in


terms of shortwave radiation biases; overestimation of clouds by the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) in


the deep tropics (in particular) with the corresponding impact in the outgoing longwave radiation; large


spread between the different models in terms of cloud cover, liquid water path and shortwave radiation;


significant differences between the models in terms of vertical cross sections of cloud properties (in partic-


ular), vertical velocity, and relative humidity. An alternative analysis of cloud cover mean statistics is pro-


posed where sharp gradients in cloud cover along the GPCI transect are taken into account. This analysis


shows that the negative cloud bias of some models and ERA-40 in the stratocumulus regions [as compared to


the first International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP)] is associated not only with lower values of


cloud cover in these regimes, but also with a stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition that occurs too early along


the trade wind Lagrangian trajectory. Histograms of cloud cover along the cross section differ significantly


between models. Some models exhibit a quasi-bimodal structure with cloud cover being either very large


(close to 100%) or very small, while other models show a more continuous transition. The ISCCP observa-


tions suggest that reality is in-between these two extreme examples. These different patterns reflect the di-


verse nature of the cloud, boundary layer, and convection parameterizations in the participating weather and


climate prediction models.


1. Introduction


By the end of World War II there were 22 weather


ships stationed in the Atlantic Ocean and 24 in the Pa-


cific Ocean.1 From July to October 1945, three weather


ships were stationed in a Pacific transect from San Fran-


cisco to Honolulu and were able to sample in a fairly


continuous manner the weather conditions in a region


where important climatic cloud transitions occur from


stratocumulus regimes (off the coast of California) to


cumulus regimes close to Hawaii. The observations col-


lected by these ships along this Pacific Ocean transect


allowed, for the first time, construction of a detailed view


of the three-dimensional structure of this key subtropical


boundary layer transition as the atmosphere is advected


over warmer waters (and lower subsidence) along the


trade winds (Riehl et al. 1951).


Along similar transects, the stratocumulus cloud decks,


which typically overlay the cold waters off the west coast


of continents, transition to shallow cumulus topped


boundary layers (e.g., Albrecht et al. 1995; Bretherton


et al. 1999) and then eventually to deep cumulus con-


vection over the warmer waters of the intertropical


convergence zone. The cloud regimes, associated with


the boundary layer, deep convection, and the transitions


between them, play a significant role in modulating the


tropical and subtropical atmospheric circulation and are


known to have a profound influence on the physics and


dynamics of climate (e.g., Philander et al. 1996; Ma et al.


1996; Larson et al. 1999). In climate change sensitivity


experiments (e.g., doubling CO2), current climate models


display profoundly different responses in terms of


boundary layer (low) clouds, often leading to cloud–


climate feedbacks of opposing signal (e.g., Bony et al.


2004, 2006; Bony and Dufresne 2005; Wyant et al. 2006;


Stephens 2005). It is tenable that changes in the charac-


teristics of the stratocumulus to cumulus transition play


an important role in cloud–climate feedbacks.


Unfortunately, many of the important characteristics


of these cloud regimes are not realistically represented


in weather and climate prediction models (e.g., Jakob


1999; Duynkerke and Teixeira 2001; Siebesma et al.


2004). This is in spite of some promising advances in the


development of cloud and cloudy boundary layer pa-


rameterizations during the last several years (e.g.,


Tiedtke 1993; Del Genio et al. 1996; Fowler et al. 1996;


Rasch and Kristja?nsson 1998; Lock et al. 2000; Lock 2001;


Bony and Emanuel 2001; Teixeira and Hogan 2002;


Tompkins 2002).


The need to better understand the physics and dy-


namics of clouds and to improve the parameterizations


of clouds and cloud-related processes in weather and


climate prediction models led to the creation of the


1 After the war 13 weather ships remained in the Atlantic and


Pacific until 1980.

Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX)


Cloud Systems Study (GCSS) in the early 1990s (Browning


et al. 1993; Randall et al. 2003). The research efforts in


GCSS have been divided into different cloud types


(boundary layer clouds, cirrus, frontal clouds, deep con-


vection, and polar clouds) and have extensively used


large-eddy simulation (LES) and cloud-resolving models


(CRM) to assess and develop parameterizations for single-


column models (SCM), which are one-dimensional ver-


sions of weather and climate prediction models.


The traditional GCSS strategy can be divided in the


following steps: (i) create a case study using observations;


(ii) evaluate CRM/LES models for the case study; (iii)


use SCMs to evaluate the parameterizations; and (iv) use


the statistics from CRM/LES to develop and improve


parameterizations. This strategy has been quite successful


in improving CRM/LES models, in helping to define and


understand fundamental cloud regimes (e.g., Duynkerke


et al. 1999; Bretherton et al. 1999; Bechtold et al. 2000;


Redelsperger et al. 2000; Stevens et al. 2001; Randall et al.


2003; Siebesma et al. 2003) and in developing new pa-


rameterizations for clouds and the cloudy boundary layer


(e.g., Cuijpers and Bechtold 1995; Lock et al. 2000; Golaz


et al. 2002; Teixeira and Hogan 2002; Cheinet and Teixeira


2003; Lenderink and Holtslag 2004; Bretherton et al. 2004;


Soares et al. 2004; Bretherton and Park 2009).


2. GCSS/WGNE Pacific cross-section
intercomparison


a. Introduction


Despite its successes, the current GCSS strategy of


using only one-dimensional subsets (SCMs) of weather


and climate prediction models falls short of addressing


the fundamental role of clouds in climate since it does not


allow for feedback to the large-scale dynamics. The latter


can only be achieved by using fully three-dimensional


models of the atmosphere. In turn, the analysis of such


models is notoriously difficult owing to the large amount


of information required for meaningful conclusions to be


drawn.


In this paper, a model evaluation strategy is adopted


in which weather and climate prediction models are ana-


lyzed along a cross section in the Pacific Ocean, from the


coast of California to the equatorial region, as illustrated


in Fig. 1. The figure also depicts the low (boundary layer)


cloud cover climatology from the International Satellite


Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) (Rossow and Schiffer


1999) for the June–July–August (JJA) season. This ap-


proach aims at complementing the more traditional ef-


forts in GCSS by providing a simple framework for the


evaluation of weather and climate prediction models


that encompasses several fundamental cloud regimes,


such as stratocumulus, shallow cumulus, and deep cu-


mulus, as well as the transitions between them. The fact


that data is only needed along a model transect allows for


a technically less involved intercomparison.


The overall goal is to use the GPCI framework to un-


derstand cloud regimes and regime transitions in the


tropics and subtropics and to characterize the main de-


ficiencies in climate models in terms of the representa-


tion of clouds and cloud-related processes. These analyses


should lead to the development of new parameteriza-


tions of clouds, boundary layer, and convection and con-


sequently contribute to more accurate predictions of


climate change. Ultimately, it is the combination of the


model and the satellite data and the use of new analysis


techniques that will improve our ability to not only es-


tablish the model shortcomings but also to gain insight in


the physical reasons leading to these deficiencies.


Preliminary studies using a similar cross section across


the Pacific Ocean were performed in the context of a


European Cloud Systems Study (EUROCS). While im-


portant, the EUROCS results (Siebesma et al. 2004) were


limited due to coarse temporal resolution (only monthly


mean values at four different times per day were avail-


able) and the absence of some critical observational data


sources for the evaluation of the model results, such as


information about the tropospheric temperature and


humidity structure.


As a summary, the main general motivations for


GPCI are


d to study important cloud regimes and transitions—


stratocumulus, shallow cumulus, and deep convection;
d to evaluate models and observations in the tropics and


subtropics in terms of the atmospheric hydrologic


cycle;
d to utilize a new generation of satellite datasets;
d to help the development of new cloud, convection, and


turbulence parameterizations in weather and climate


models;

d to include 3D weather and climate models in the GCSS


framework; and
d to create a database of models and observations for


future studies of the tropics and subtropics.


b. Model data


Model output from over 20 weather and climate pre-


diction organizations was collected and organized for


GPCI (see appendix A and Tables A1 and A2 therein for


more information). The three-hourly model output from


simulations of the periods of June–July–August 1998 and


2003 (only 1998 results are discussed in this paper) is


produced for 13 points along the GPCI transect from


358N, 1258W in the northeast to 18S, 1738W in the


southwest (see appendix B for details on the GPCI


specifications—in particular, the locations of the points).


A three-hourly model output frequency permits better


characterization of the diurnal variability and provides


the opportunity of applying novel model evaluation


techniques. These types of analyses were unavailable


during the EUROCS study (Siebesma et al. 2004) be-


cause of the temporally sparse data sampling.


c. Satellite data


In the context of GPCI, model results are evaluated


against a variety of satellite observations. Satellite ob-


servations have been for some time a fundamental tool


for our understanding of the role of clouds in the climate


system (e.g., Ramanathan et al. 1989; Harrison et al. 1990;


Rossow and Schiffer 1991, 1999; Wielicki et al. 1995;


Chylek et al. 2007) and for the evaluation of climate and


weather prediction models (e.g., Cess et al. 1997; Webb


et al. 2001; Randall et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2005). The high


vertical and temporal resolution of the GPCI model data


will facilitate a more complete utilization of satellite data.


A collection of satellite data related to GPCI is avail-


able online at the GCSS Data Integration for Model


Evaluation (DIME) Web site (http://gcss-dime.giss.nasa.


gov/). These datasets include high temporal resolution


data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology


Project (ISCCP) together with daily products from the


Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), the Global


Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), and the TIROS


Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS). For more details


on the satellite data see appendix C. In this manuscript


the potential of the ISCCP data for the study of cloud


regime transitions is explored in detail. Note, that when


using the ISCCP simulator (Klein and Jakob 1999; Webb


et al. 2001) it is often possible to extract more informa-


tion from a comparison between models and ISCCP ob-


servations. Unfortunately, many of the models used in the


GPCI exercise do not have the ISCCP simulator imple-


mented. To make this intercomparison as inclusive


and simple as possible no ISCCP simulator output was


requested.


d. Two-dimensional data


It can be argued that a single cross section may miss


key physical events that occur in a certain region. For ex-


ample, when analyzing the diurnal cycle over the stra-


tocumulus regions, it must be taken into account that


subsidence may be caused by convection somewhere over


land, which may not be present in the cross section. To


tackle these types of problems without requiring vast


amounts of three dimensional data, GPCI requested out-


put [of only a few variables such as outgoing longwave


radiation (OLR) or precipitation, for example] in a two-


dimensional region that contains the cross section (58S–


458N, 1608E–1208W).


3. How representative is the GPCI transect?


The first obvious question regarding this study is: how


representative is the GPCI transect in the sense of cap-


turing the most relevant physical processes of this region


of the subtropical and tropical Pacific?


In this section two types of results are shown so as to


address this question. First, the wind direction at 1000


and 900 hPa along the GPCI cross section from the 40-yr


ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) product (Uppala et al.


2005) is analyzed. Figures 2 and 3 show histograms of


wind direction at 900 and 1000 hPa, respectively, for six


points along the GPCI transect for June–July–August


(JJA) 1998. These figures illustrate how, for (at least) the


points from 88 to 268N (at 1000 hPa), and from 148 to


268N (at 900 hPa), the wind direction histograms are


reasonably parallel to the GPCI transect. These results


confirm that, at least for ERA-40, the orientation of the


GPCI transect is close to the mean boundary-layer trade


wind trajectories. This may well not be exactly the case


for some of the models, but as will be shown later, all


models exhibit characteristics of a Hadley circulation in


this region, suggesting that the model boundary layer


trajectories do not diverge profoundly from the ERA-40


results.


The 2D dataset mentioned above is used so as to in-


vestigate how representative histograms of variables, like


total cloud cover (TCC) and precipitation, are along the


GPCI transect compared to longitudinally adjacent points


(5 degrees to the east and to the west). Figure 4 shows the


histograms of precipitation for one GPCI point (58N,


1958E) and the two adjacent points from the GFDL, and


NCAR models for the period of June–July–August


1998. Figure 5 shows a similar plot but for the TCC and


another GPCI point—208N, 2158E. It is clear from these


figures that the histograms for both TCC and precipitation


5226 J O U R N A L O F C L I M A T E VOLUME 24







are quite similar between adjacent points for the same


model and quite different between models. Similar results


are obtained for different points along the GPCI transect


as well as for different models (not shown). Overall, these


results support the idea that GPCI is sufficiently repre-


sentative for the purposes of this study of the main model


physical processes of the subtropics in this region.


4. Mean single-level parameter results


In this and the following subsections several results will


be analyzed. The results shown correspond to June–July–


August 1998. The sea surface temperature (SST) boundary


condition is prescribed in virtually all of the models (the


exception being the NCEP coupled ocean–atmosphere


version] but following slightly independent implemen-


tation techniques (e.g., different SST analysis). Figure 6


shows the June–July–August 1998 mean SST prescribed


(or obtained, in the case of the coupled system) for each of


the model simulations along the GPCI transect. Although


using slightly different implementations for describing


SST, all of the (uncoupled) models show similar SST


distributions along the GPCI transect. The SSTs increase


almost linearly southward from the cold waters (;290 K)


off the coast of California and peak in the ITCZ region


(;302 K). The SST from the NCEP coupled simulation


[NCEP GFS and MOM3 (G&amp;amp;M3) in the figure] is


warmer in the subtropical regions, associated (at least


partly) with a negative cloud bias. We will return to this


important feedback between low clouds and the SST.


Figure 7a shows the ensemble (composed of the differ-


ent models) model mean and the across-model variabil-


ity of total column water vapor (TWV) along the GPCI


transect for JJA 1998. The across-model variability is


characterized by the ensemble mean plus or minus the


standard deviation and by the maximum and minimum


values attained by any of the models (range) for a par-


ticular GPCI-transect point. Also shown are the results


from ERA-40 and the SSM/I observations. The increase


of TWV from the stratocumulus regions off California


toward the ITCZ follows the increase in SST. According to


SSM/I, the TWV increases from around 18 kg m22 close


to the California coast (358N) to just over 50 kg m22 over


the ITCZ. This illustrates well the major changes that

occur in the atmospheric column as it transitions from a


situation with a shallow boundary layer, capped by a dry


upper troposphere, to a situation with fully developed


deep moist convection events.


TWV is an integral parameter that is fundamental in


characterizing the atmospheric hydrologic cycle. In this


context, the good agreement between SSM/I and ERA-40


is worthy of notice. If these observations and analyses


were to differ in any significant manner in terms of this


key parameter, this would mean that there were some


serious deficiencies in either or both of these datasets.


Fortunately this is not the case. Of course, since ERA-40


assimilates observations such as (or of the type of) SSM/I,


it could still be argued that these similarities are to be


expected. In general, these results suggest that ERA-40


is reproducing well this integral parameter in terms of


the hydrologic cycle. On the other hand, as will be amply


discussed in this paper, ERA-40 still suffers from de-


ficiencies in many variables and this type of agreement


between ERA-40 and the observations is not so com-


mon for other parameters.


Many of the models exhibit a behavior, in terms of


TWV, that is not substantially different from the one


obtained with SSM/I or ERA-40. This is not necessarily


surprising given the integral nature of TWV. Some models,


however, do show noticeable departures from SSM/I


and ERA-40 (in some, or even all, of the locations along


the GPCI transect). Because TWV is an integral measure


of the atmospheric water vapor content, the across-model


standard deviation looks relatively small when compared


to other variables, but the minimum and maximum values


are of concern. In the stratocumulus regions, the differ-


ence between the maximum and minimum values is of


the same order of magnitude as the measured TWV.


These differences in terms of TWV are often associated


with differences in boundary layer height. Boundary layer


height is a key parameter in characterizing the cloudy


boundary layer structure and, as will be discussed below,


the models produce a variety of behaviors leading to sig-


nificant differences in terms of clouds and boundary layer


height (e.g., Karlsson et al. 2010). In the deep tropics the


difference between maximum and minimum values is


O(20 kg m22).


The simulated and observed (ISCCP) total cloud cover


(TCC) along the GPCI transect is shown in Fig. 7b.


Immediately obvious, when compared with TWV, is the


FIG. 3. As in Fig. 2, but at 1000 hPa.


5228 J O U R N A L O F C L I M A T E VOLUME 24







degree of scatter of the results. From this plot alone it is


quite clear that weather and climate prediction models


have serious problems simulating clouds. Note that, as


opposed to TWV (as discussed above), ERA-40 diverges


substantially from ISCCP. Although ISCCP observations


still have significant uncertainties, in particular ISCCP


TCC in the tropics is an underestimate by 10%–15%


because of very thin cirrus that are not detected (e.g.,


Stubenrauch et al. 1999), it is fair to argue that at this stage


of current understanding, the ISCCP cloud cover product


is more trustworthy than ERA-40, which is an analysis


that assimilates virtually no explicit cloud information.


In particular, ERA-40 underestimates TCC in the strato-


cumulus (and initial transition to cumulus) region, between


238 and 358N and overestimates TCC in the ITCZ region.


This negative TCC bias in the stratocumulus regions was


much more pronounced in ERA-15, the previous version


of the reanalysis (Duynkerke and Teixeira 2001), but has


been ameliorated with subsequent model improvements,


namely increased vertical resolution in the boundary layer


(Teixeira 1999). ERA-Interim, the most recent ECWMF


version of the reanalysis, has shown significant additional


improvements of the simulations of marine low clouds


due to the implementation of the eddy-diffusivity mass-flux


approach, originally proposed by Siebesma and Teixeira


(2000), focused on the stratocumulus regime (Ko?hler 2005;


Hannay et al. 2009).


The models in general, as can be seen by the ensemble


mean, still underestimate TCC in the stratocumulus


regions—a negative bias of around 20%–30% compared


to ISCCP. Some models produce extremely low values


of TCC in regions typically associated with stratocumulus


and where ISCCP TCC is large. However, there are a few


models that manage to simulate stratocumulus TCC in a


relatively accurate manner. In the trade cumulus regions


between 148 and 208N the ensemble mean shows good


agreement with ERA-40 and ISCCP. In the ITCZ region


the ensemble model mean is reasonably close to ISCCP,


while ERA-40 overestimates TCC by as much as 20%


(note, however, the possible ISCCP negative bias in the


deep tropics mentioned above). The standard deviation


and range between maximum and minimum values of


TCC in this region are also quite large. Overall the TCC


across-model variability (standard deviation and range) is


uncomfortably large throughout the entire GPCI tran-


sect: the difference between the maximum and minimum


values is always larger than 50% cloud cover.


It is important to note that sometimes in the plots being


shown the maximum and minimum values are associated


with models that are clearly underperforming when

compared with most models for that particular variable.


However, except for situations in which a particular model


produces values that are unphysical or clearly divergent


from all the other models, we opt for including all models in


the statistics. On the other hand, the range between models


in variables like TCC is physically significant (not nec-


essarily in a purely statistical sense) and should be in-


terpreted as a serious problem of weather and climate


prediction models in general. The reader interested in


analyzing the data from a particular model is advised to


go to the GPCI/DIME Web site (http://gcss-dime.giss.nasa.


gov/gpci/modsim_gpci_models.html).


Figure 7c shows the equivalent figure but for the liquid


water path (LWP) with observations from SSM/I. It is


clear that both ERA-40 and the ensemble model mean


underestimate LWP in the stratocumulus regions, while


ERA-40 (but not the ensemble mean) overestimates LWP


values over the trade cumulus regions. Over the deep


tropics ERA-40 clearly overestimates LWP as compared


with SSM/I, with a peak of around 350 g m
22


versus an


observed peak of about 200 g m
22


, while the ensemble


mean is relatively close to the observations.


It must be noted that LWP observations from micro-


wave instruments such as SSM/I can have significant un-


certainties (see Li et al. 2008, for a comparison between


different satellite observations of LWP). The results


shown in Fig. 7c are, however, consistent with the overall


picture of an underestimation of clouds from ERA-40


and the ensemble mean over the stratocumulus regions


and an overestimation of ERA-40 over the ITCZ. More


recent observations such as from CloudSat (e.g., Stephens


et al. 2002) may help clarify some of the observational


issues and narrow down the observational uncertainties.


A remarkable characteristic of the model results is again

their large across-model variability. The LWP minimum


and mean minus one standard deviation are extremely


low throughout the transect, illustrating well the diffi-


culties that climate and weather prediction models have


in representing boundary layer clouds in a realistic way.


Figure 7d is the equivalent figure for precipitation with


GPCP observations. This figure illustrates well a key dif-


ference between the subtropical regions dominated by


boundary layer clouds and the ITCZ dominated by deep


convection. In models and observations the subtropics are


characterized by modest (or virtually absent) amounts of


precipitation, with the exception of the model maximum


value, showing that at least one model produces precip-


itation close to 2 mm day
21


in the trade cumulus regions.


Note that accurate observations of precipitation in these


relatively dry regions are hard to obtain (e.g., Adler et al.


2003), and we should consider that the error bars asso-


ciated with GPCP in these regions are relatively large


(percentwise) (e.g., Janowiak et al. 1998). Over the ITCZ,


GPCP shows mean June–July–August 1998 values of


around 9 mm day21 slightly below the model ensemble


mean. ERA-40, on the other hand, produces values


slightly above the maximum value of all the models and


about twice as estimated by GPCP; again, an overactive


ERA-40 in the deep tropics is apparent.


The outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) results are


shown in Fig. 8a with observations from CERES. Over the


subtropical regions dominated by boundary layer clouds


topped by a dry free troposphere, the OLR CERES


observations lie in-between the model ensemble mean


values (lower than the observations) and ERA-40 (higher


than the observations). In the deep convective regions


ERA-40 underestimates the OLR, when compared with


CERES data, producing a bias of around 20 W m
22


,


while the ensemble mean follows the CERES observa-


tions quite closely. An underestimation of OLR in ERA-40


for the ITCZ is consistent with positive ERA-40 biases


of LWP, precipitation, and TCC.


The equivalent figure for the net shortwave radiative


flux at the top of the atmosphere (SW at TOA) is shown

in Fig. 8b, with observations from CERES. The results of


net SW at TOA from ERA-40 and from the ensemble


mean are relatively similar in the subtropical regions.


Over the stratocumulus areas both ERA-40 and the


ensemble mean overestimate the net SW at TOA by up


to 50 W m22 on the mean, reflecting a negative bias in


terms of cloud cover and cloud water. Over the Cu regions


ERA-40 and the ensemble model mean underestimate


the net SW radiation at TOA. For ERA-40 this can be


(at least) partly explained by an overestimation of LWP


in the region. Simulated subtropical trade wind cumulus


has been reported to be too reflective in climate models


compared to observations (e.g., Potter and Cess 2004;


Karlsson et al. 2008). This might explain the ensemble


model mean underestimation of net SW radiation in the


Cu regions. In the ITCZ the ensemble model mean shows


better agreement with CERES, while ERA-40 is asso-


ciated with a negative TOA net SW radiation bias of


;50 W m
22


, most likely connected to the positive LWP


and cloud cover bias in the region. Again, the variability


between the different models is substantial and clearly


problematic in particular in the context of coupled ocean–


atmosphere seasonal and climate prediction.


5. Vertical cross sections


Figure 9 shows vertical cross sections of subsidence in


Pa s21 along the GPCI transect from the different models.


Qualitatively all models produce (as expected) features


that resemble the Hadley circulation with dominant up-


ward motion over the ITCZ and a dominant subsidence


region throughout the subtropical free troposphere.


In spite of the qualitative agreement, there are several


substantial differences between the models. For example,


some models, ETH/MPI being the most extreme case,


exhibit a fairly shallow layer of upward vertical motion


in the ITCZ (in the ETH–MPI model over the ITCZ the


layer of upward mean vertical velocity does not appear


to extend above 700 hPa). The width and strength of the


deep convection regions are other examples of the dif-


ferences between the models, with the GISS model


having a fairly wide and weak deep convection (as given


by the vertical velocity field) while ERA-40 has a rela-


tively narrow and much stronger deep convection ver-


tical velocity structure. Another relevant difference is


the fact that some models have a peak of vertical ve-


locity in the convective regions in the lower troposphere


while others also have a peak in the upper troposphere.


In addition, and although the patterns are in general


relatively similar between the different models, there are


differences in the subsidence regions as well. In particular,


the free-troposphere vertical structure of subsidence in


the trade wind regions and the vertical extent of the sub-


sidence field in the boundary layer can be quite different


between the models. The vertical structure of subsidence


is crucial in determining the vertical extent of boundary


layer convection and the characteristics of clouds.


The corresponding results for relative humidity are


shown in Fig. 10. Relative humidity is a particularly in-


formative field in terms of the characterization of the


atmospheric hydrologic cycle in a variety of aspects from


boundary layer and cloud properties to the dryness of the


subtropical free troposphere. As with subsidence, a first


look at the different relative humidity model fields shows


FIG. 8. (a) Outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) from the models along GPCI for June–July–August 1998 together


with ERA-40 and CERES, (b) as in (a) but for net shortwave radiation at the TOA and CERES observations. Results


from the different models are shown as ensemble mean results, the mean plus or minus the standard deviation, and


the maximum and minimum values attained by any model for a particular point (referred to as range).


5232 J O U R N A L O F C L I M A T E VOLUME 24







that all models possess the qualitative characteristics of a


Hadley-like circulation. The boundary layer evolves from


shallow and cloudy (with high values of relative humidity)


over the cold upwelling waters off California to a deeper


trade-wind boundary layer over warmer waters. Over the


warm regions of the ITCZ the troposphere is dominated


by deep convection (in general, with high relative humid-


ity values throughout the troposphere) and in the sub-


tropical free troposphere the dynamics is dominated by


the large-scale subsidence associated with very low values


of relative humidity.


In spite of the qualitative agreement between the


models, the level of disagreement is significant. In terms


of the boundary layer the most obvious difference is re-


lated to how the boundary layer grows from the Sc re-


gions to the Cu regions in the models. Some models show


a low boundary layer height over the Sc regions [e.g.,


NCAR, UQM) often together with a low growth of the


boundary layer over warmer waters, while other models


seem to produce an excessive growth of the boundary


layer reaching values that are not realistic (e.g., the DWD


produces a boundary layer height over the trade cumulus


regions close to 700 hPa). Note that we do not compare


directly model relative humidity results with observa-


tions in this paper [e.g., results from comparisons with


the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) are left for


a future publication], and that this discussion is meant to


highlight the differences between the models (and the


ERA-40 analysis).


As discussed before concerning vertical velocity, models


show substantial differences in terms of deep convection


that are even more obvious when analyzing the vertical


distribution of relative humidity along the GPCI transect.


Differences are clear not only in terms of strength and


width of deep convection but also in terms of wetness and


dryness (in relative humidity terms) of particular regions


of the atmosphere. For example, virtually all models have


a minimum of relative humidity around 400 hPa but dis-


agree on the absolute value of the relative humidity mini-


mum. Some of the models (e.g., ETH–MPI, Me?te?o-France,


UCLA) have values of relative humidity that are lower


than 20%, while other models (e.g., GFDL, JAMSTEC)


have values close to 50%. Below the tropical tropopause


the differences are also significant, with some models (e.g.,


GISS, CMC) showing values of relative humidity close to


40% while others [e.g., CSU multiscale modeling frame-


work (MMF), ECMWF] have values close to 100%.


In the subsidence regions over the subtropical bound-


ary layer, the models also show substantial differences


highlighting the fact that the physics of the free tropo-


sphere in the models can be quite complex. Below the


tropopause close to 358N, models range from the very dry


(e.g., DWD, GISS) with relative humidity close to 10% to


the very wet with relative humidity close to 70% (e.g., CSU


BUGS). All models exhibit a minimum value for relative


humidity in some region of the subtropical free tropo-


sphere, but the location of this region can vary signifi-


cantly from model to model. Some models exhibit this


minimum above the stratocumulus regions (e.g., NCAR)


while other models (e.g., GKSS), Meteo-France) exhibit


a minimum much closer to the deep convection regions.


Figure 11 shows similar results for cloud fraction cross


sections. This figure illustrates well the vast differences


between models and is a good preamble for the detailed


diagnostics and discussion that will follow in the sub-


sequent sections. Qualitatively, virtually all models seem


to follow the expected evolution of the boundary layer


from the stratocumulus regions to deep tropics, but often


with fairly significant differences. Some models [e.g.,


ECMWF, GFDL, UKMO) show a smooth and gradual


evolution of the cloudy boundary layer height that, based


on some previous studies, appears to be relatively realistic


(e.g., Wyant et al. 1997; Wood and Bretherton 2004; von


Engeln et al. 2005; Karlsson et al. 2010). But, there are


many issues including (i) models that have stratocumulus


clouds too close to the surface (e.g., NCAR); (ii) models


that produce cloudy boundary layers that are too deep


over the trades (e.g., DWD); (iii) models that produce


a cloud evolution by generating two fairly distinct cloud


layers (e.g., BMRC); (iv) models that produce very


small values of cloud cover; and (v) models that show no


clear evolution of the cloudy boundary layer from stra-


tocumulus to cumulus (e.g., NCEP).


The fact that there are two sets of results from NCEP,


coupled and uncoupled to an ocean model (NCEP


GFG&amp;amp;MOM3 and NCEP, respectively), leads to some


insight into the impact on clouds of the coupling to an


ocean model. Both coupled and uncoupled versions show


small amounts of boundary layer cloud fraction, with a


peak positioned too far to the southwest and no clear


evolution of the cloudy boundary layer from stratocu-


mulus to cumulus. However, the uncoupled version pro-


duces larger values of cloud cover (close to 40%) than the


coupled version (less than 20%), and the SST of the


coupled model version is overestimated (Fig. 6). These


results are associated with a well-known positive feed-


back between subtropical boundary layer clouds and the


SST, where a negative bias in cloud cover and cloud water


leads to warmer surface waters (due to increased short-


wave radiation at the ocean surface) that, in turn, lead to


even less clouds (e.g., Philander et al. 1996; Ma et al. 1996;


Park et al. 2005; Teixeira et al. 2008). Interestingly, the


coupled version produces more clouds in the upper tro-


pospheric regions.


Over the ITCZ the differences in terms of cloud fraction


are fairly large, with some models showing substantial

amounts of cloud throughout the column (e.g., DWD,


GKSS, NCAR) while others show negligible amounts in


general (e.g., NCEP, UCLA). In the lower troposphere


some models show large cloud amounts (e.g., Me?te?o-


France) while other models show virtually no clouds (e.g.,


JAMSTEC). In the upper troposphere some models have


large values of cloud cover (e.g., NCAR) while others


have relatively small values (e.g., GISS, Meteo-France).


Similar results for liquid water content are shown in


Fig. 12, where in addition to the model data, the June–July–


August climatology (2006–10) of liquid water content from


CloudSat observations is plotted as well (e.g., Stephens


et al. 2008). In most respects the liquid water content


figures confirm the general results obtained for cloud


fraction. However, there are some noteworthy features


that are important to highlight. Some models erroneously


produce liquid water at altitudes where most likely there


is virtually no liquid water. At this stage it is unclear if


these are postprocessing issues or real model problems.


Some models do reproduce the expected evolution of


clouds along the transition from stratocumulus to cumu-


lus with values of mean boundary layer liquid water that


are roughly similar to the values obtained from CloudSat,


which is clearly a positive sign both from a modeling and


observational perspective. In this context it must be noted


that CloudSat has some problems related to the retrieval


of liquid water content in the boundary layer. Independent


of specific issues related to the retrieval methodology,


CloudSat has difficulties in obtaining reliable measure-


ments close to the ground (roughly below 1 km above the


surface) and its vertical resolution (;250–500 m) is not


adequate to fully resolve the strong gradients close to the


top of the boundary layer. Owing to these constraints,


CloudSat is not able to produce a Sc-to-Cu transition as


clearly as some of the models. In spite of this, CloudSat


appears to support the idea that the cloudy boundary-


layer height evolves from values close to 1 km above the


surface near the coast of California to near 2 km in the


trade cumulus regions.


Some of the models do exhibit what appears to be


clearly pathological behavior in the subtropical bound-


ary layer region—from models that show extremely low


values of liquid water content (with maximum values


close to 0.02 g kg21) to models that have different dis-


crete layers of cloud in the vertical. In spite of the fairly


poor model results (in general) in the Sc to Cu transition


region, close to the ITCZ the model results can be con-


sidered even worse. In these deep tropical regions the


model liquid water content vertical structure is almost as


varied as the number of models. Hardly any two models


seem to share a similar cloud liquid water vertical struc-


ture. If the CloudSat observations are used as guidance, it


is possible to state that the UKMO appears as the model


that is closest to the observations. But even this is argu-


able given the fairly ad-hoc manner in which the CloudSat


retrieval algorithm discriminates between liquid water


and ice (based on a simple mixed-phase relation using


temperature from ECMWF analysis).


Overall, these figures illustrate the enormous difficulty


that models have in even producing cloud vertical struc-


tures that are somewhat in qualitative agreement with


each other and with the few global observations that exist.


Note that additional results and figures can be obtained


at the GPCI/DIME webpage (see section 4).


6. Boundary layer cloud transition and statistics
using sharp gradients


In the previous sections we reported on a variety of


model diagnostics related to cloud regime transitions. This


was done mainly with the goal of characterizing the mean


thermodynamic structure in a variety of weather and cli-


mate prediction models. In this section, and in the fol-


lowing one, we use cloud data from the different models


and from ISCCP observations to characterize in more


detail the cloud transitions in the tropics and subtropics


and to evaluate how well the models reproduce these


transitions. In this context we try to relate the results of


some of these models with the parameterizations used


for representing clouds and the boundary layer.


In a previous section (Fig. 7b) the June–July–August


1998 mean TCC along the GPCI cross section for the


model ensemble mean, ERA-40, and ISCCP is shown. This


type of typical seasonal mean is calculated in a straightfor-


ward way, by estimating the temporal mean at each one


of the cross-section points. However, since instantaneous


(3-hourly) values of cloud cover can have sharp gradients


along the GPCI transect, this averaging methodology will


smooth out the gradients and will consequently lose in-


formation related to these discontinuities, which are im-


portant manifestations of the stratocumulus to cumulus


transition.


In this section a different methodology to perform the


averaging is proposed: by (i) determining the location of


the first sharp gradient (specifically a drop with a partic-


ular threshold of 20 or 30%) in total cloud cover (TCC)


along the transect starting at the northernmost point (Sc


region) every three hours and then (ii) assuming uniform


cloud cover to the northeast (NE) and southwest (SW)


of the gradient’s location by taking the spatial averages


of TCC for all the points to each side (NE and SW) of the


location of the sharp gradient. Figure 13 shows that,


using this methodology, it is possible to capture some of


the features of this discontinuous transition. The results


in this figure correspond to TCC data from ISCCP and


ERA-40. The left figure shows averaged TCC for both


5242 J O U R N A L O F C L I M A T E VOLUME 24







ERA-40 and ISCCP based on this methodology (i.e.,


averaged TCC for all the points south and north of each


individual transition location) with the jump in TCC


being located at the mean gradient location, while the


figure on the right shows histograms of the locations of


these strong (.30%) gradients of TCC. Using different


thresholds for the drop of TCC (e.g., 20% or 30%) does


not make much of a difference in the final mean results,


which is a positive outcome regarding the robustness of


the method. Note that even in the subtropics changes in


TCC may not reflect only changes in boundary layer cloud


cover [or low cloud cover (LCC)] but also changes in high


and midlevel cloud cover.


There are substantial differences between ERA-40 and


ISCCP in this context. The mean gradient strength is dif-


ferent between the two with values around 40% for ISCCP


and 20% for ERA-40. The TCC values to the northeast


and southwest of the gradient’s location are quite different


as well—to the northeast of the mean gradient location


ISCCP TCC is about 10% larger than ERA-40 TCC, while


to the southwest ERA-40 TCC is about 15% larger than


ISCCP TCC. The mean location of the gradient is also


different, with the ERA-40 location being at 268N while


the ISCCP location is at 208N.


This analysis suggests that the ERA-40 negative cloud


bias in the Sc regions is related, not only to the fact that


TCC values in the Sc regions are in general lower than in the


ISCCP data, but also to the fact that the transition from


stratocumulus to cumulus (i.e., location of the mean gradi-


ent) is too far to the northeast—too early from a Lagrangian


perspective—as compared to ISCCP observations.


An analysis of the histogram of locations of the sharp


gradient for both ERA-40 and ISCCP (Fig. 13, right panel)


clearly shows that the transition from stratocumulus to


cumulus occurs too early (in a Lagrangian perspective)


in the ERA-40 dataset with a histogram peak close to the


coast of California (358N), while the peak in the ISCCP


observations is close to 238N. Another difference between


the two datasets is the occurrence (occ) of instantaneous


gradients (larger than 30%) of TCC along the GPCI


transect. It is slightly less in the ISCCP dataset (around


90% of the times) than in the ERA-40 dataset (around


97% of the times). Note that, for TCC gradients larger than


50%, ISCCP and ERA-40 have a frequency of occurrence


greater than 60% and 70%, respectively (not shown).


Figure 14 shows similar results, but for the different


models, where it is clear that there are substantial dif-


ferences between the models in this context. These major


differences exist in all of the main parameters being ana-


lyzed: the location and strength of the mean gradient,


the cloud amount northeast and southwest of the mean


gradient’s location, and the characteristics of the histo-


gram of the gradient locations.


In terms of the strength of the mean gradient there are


important differences between models such as UCLA, CSU


BUGS, and UKMO (with gradients stronger than 40% on


the mean) and models such as CMC that have virtually no


gradient in TCC between stratocumulus and cumulus re-


gimes (recall that ISCCP has a value of around 40%). The


stronger gradients in models such as UKMO and UCLA


are probably related to the nature of the cloudy boundary-


layer formulation. This will be discussed in more detail in


the next section. In terms of the frequency of occurrence of


gradients in TCC as large as 30%, most models are close to


the results from ERA-40 with values just slightly below


100% except for the following models: NCAR, LMD,


CCCma, and GISS, which have values below 90%.


Again, and as expected, there is a large amount of var-


iability in terms of the TCC values to the northeast and


southwest of the mean gradient locations for the different

details): (left) averaged TCC for both ERA-40 and ISCCP based on this methodology and (right) histograms of the


locations of these strong (.30%) gradients of TCC.

models. In addition, there is a variety of shapes for the


model histograms of the instantaneous locations of these


strong gradients. Some models exhibit a one-peak dis-


tribution that can be well localized (e.g., UCLA) or have


a large standard deviation (e.g., NCEP). Other models


exhibit histograms with two prominent peaks (e.g., GFDL


and CCC), while even more complex behaviors can be


obtained (e.g., NCAR has three peaks with the most


pronounced being at 58N). Note that ISCCP exhibits two


peaks: a dominant one at 238N and a smaller one at 58N.

7. Histograms of cloud cover transition


Diagnostics that analyze only seasonal mean values


(e.g., mean cross section of TCC for example) are fairly


incomplete in terms of providing information about the


variability in time of a particular variable in a certain re-


gion (even the variance itself can be sometimes relatively


meaningless for more complex distributions). Going back


to the problem of how stratocumulus boundary layers


transition to cumulus boundary layers along the trades,


FIG. 14. (Continued)


15 OCTOBER 2011 T E I X E I R A E T A L . 5245







valid questions regarding the model simulations are 1) how


are the models reproducing this transition; 2) how do the


models compare to satellite observations (e.g., ISCCP) of


the transition; and 3) is this transition, in TCC, for example,


fairly abrupt or pretty continuous in its nature?


As an attempt to answer these questions, Fig. 15 shows


histograms of instantaneous TCC along the GPCI tran-


sect from the different models, ERA-40, and the ISCCP


observations for JJA98. Again, a variety of behaviors be-


tween the different models is clear. In this context models


such as NCAR and UKMO illustrate well two very dis-


tinct behaviors. It is clear that the differences in TCC be-


tween the models are more than just differences in terms


of mean TCC, which is a traditional metric for the eval-


uation of cloud cover parameterizations in climate pre-


diction models. In the UKMO model, the cloud cover


shows a clear bimodal structure with most events occur-


ring for TCC values either close to 0% or close to 100%.


NCAR, on the other hand, shows a substantially distinct


behavior with a relatively smooth transition from the


subtropical stratocumulus regions to the tropics. These


fairly distinct results were already clear when analyzing


Fig. 5, which illustrated the differences between the GFDL


and NCAR TCC in the GPCI point situated at 208N. In


practice, at latitudes close to 208N, a typical transition re-


gion between stratocumulus and cumulus regimes, these


three models (GFDL, UKMO, and NCAR) have fairly


similar JJA98 mean TCC values. However, it is clear from


these histograms that similar mean results can be associ-


ated with significantly different cloud distributions.


These two very distinct behaviors are associated with


the manner in which clouds and cloud-related processes are


FIG. 14. (Continued)


5246 J O U R N A L O F C L I M A T E VOLUME 24







parameterized. In the NCAR model, cloud cover associ-


ated with the subtropical boundary layer is partly param-


eterized based on dependence on the lower-tropospheric


stability (LTS) parameter, which is defined as the differ-


ence between the potential temperature at 700 hPa and


at the surface (e.g., Klein and Hartmann 1993; Rasch and


Kristja?nsson 1998). This empirical relation is based on


observations (e.g., Slingo 1980; Klein and Hartmann


1993) and versions based on similar ideas have been used


as boundary-layer (stratocumulus) cloud cover parame-


terizations for some time (e.g., Slingo 1987). However,


this empirical dependence is apparently valid in longer


time scales (e.g., seasonal) but not necessarily at the


typical time-step and horizontal gridbox scales (e.g.,


Kawai and Teixeira 2010). By utilizing this dependence


between cloud cover and LTS directly as a cloud cover


parameterization, the NCAR model is partly imposing


a climatological value of cloud cover leading to the fairly


continuous TCC transition shown in Fig. 15. Note how-


ever that, although the LTS parameterization is likely


responsible for the behavior of the NCAR TCC statistics,


this cannot be stated for sure because of a variety of rea-


sons: total cloud cover is not the same as level-by-level


cloud fraction (there is a cloud overlap calculation in-


volved), the cloud fraction at each point and level is de-


termined as some combination of different cloud fractions


of which the LTS cloud fraction is only one, and it is also


not clear how often the LTS cloud fraction parameteri-


zation determines the final values of cloud fraction.


The UKMO model (and partly GFDL) has a cloudy


boundary layer parameterization based on the concept


of ‘‘distinct cloud regimes’’ (e.g., Lock et al. 2000), which


assumes that the subtropical boundary layer can be di-


vided in a finite number of different types or regimes


(e.g., stratocumulus, cumulus, transition from cumulus


to stratocumulus). In this approach the problem of


parameterizing boundary layer properties is appar-


ently simplified by the fact that only a finite number of


different physical regimes need to be represented. A


key problem of this parameterization philosophy is


the representation of the transitions between the


different discreet regimes. This ‘‘discrete’’ nature of


the UKMO cloudy boundary layer parameterization


is presumably responsible for relatively sharp cloud


regime transitions and consequently the bimodal na-


ture of the TCC histograms.


In Fig. 15 ISCCP observations of TCC (shown twice at


the bottom of each page) show results that are somewhere


in-between these two extreme behaviors. Although ISCCP


shows a certain degree of bimodality these results suggest


that none of these more ‘‘extreme’’ parameterization phi-


losophies produces a fully realistic answer when compared


to the observations.


Although many of them do fall into one of these cate-


gories, models exhibit a variety of behaviors in terms of


TCC histograms. The GISS model, for example, shows no


apparent transition, while the CCC model exhibits quite


a complex distribution. The UCLA model, on the other


hand, shows a fairly random histogram. In addition, some


models exhibit histogram peaks in specific regions that are


not apparent in the observations: JAMSTEC has a clear


30% peak at 88N, while KNMI has a 50% peak at around


238N.


8. Low cloud cover versus vertical velocity and
sea surface temperature


The period of this study (June–July–August 1998) is too


short to obtain statistically significant results concerning


relations between cloud properties such as cloud cover


and other properties such as measures of vertical sta-


bility (e.g., Klein and Hartmann 1993; Wood and


Bretherton 2006; Kawai and Teixeira 2010). However, it


is still useful to investigate how different cloud structures


produced by different models relate to meteorological


quantities such as SST and subsidence along GPCI.


Previous studies have shown a significant relation be-


tween cloud cover and different variables that basically


characterize atmospheric vertical stability in the cloudy


boundary layer. Klein and Hartmann (1993) showed a


strong relation between seasonal low cloud cover (aver-


aged in fairly large regions of the oceanic subtropics) and


lower tropospheric stability, while Wood and Bretherton


(2006) showed improved dependencies using a variant of


LTS. Kawai and Teixeira (2010) showed that not only


cloud cover correlates better with a variable related to


cloud top entrainment instability (CTEI), but that in ad-


dition higher moments of LWP (variance, skewness, and


kurtosis) are also strongly related to this CTEI variable.


In the present study, the relation between low cloud


cover (LCC), on the one hand, and vertical velocity and


SST, on the other, in a few models and ERA-40, is in-


vestigated in more detail. Both vertical velocity and SST


are known to be related to LCC in the subtropics. Over the


Sc regions, with cold SSTs and large values of subsidence,


LCC values are typically large. While being advected over


warmer waters and regions with lower values of sub-


sidence, LCC typically decreases.


The 2D joint histograms of SST and subsidence at


700 hPa for the period JJA98 are analyzed (not shown)


for ERA-40 and the following models: NCAR, GFDL,


UKMO, and the NCEP coupled simulation. The three


uncoupled models show a similar behavior with larger


values of subsidence clearly associated with the coldest


temperatures, and for SSTs generally above 292 K the


mean subsidence (for each SST) is fairly constant and just

above zero. NCAR does show larger values of subsidence


in the coldest regions, which may be associated with the


low altitude of its boundary layer clouds close to the coast.


Although different in the details, ERA-40 resembles these


three models, while the NCEP coupled simulation is


clearly different. As expected due to its positive SST


biases, the NCEP coupled simulation does miss the


coldest SSTs.

models discussed above and ERA-40. A clean and clear


relation among LCC, SST, and subsidence is not obvious


from these plots, although it is apparent that larger


values of LCC are associated with lower values of SST. It


is also clear that, while in the UKMO and ERA-40 there


is a gradual LCC transition as a function of SST, NCAR


and GFDL show LCC peaks that are not associated with


the coldest temperatures and are related to negative


subsidence values. In addition, except maybe for ERA-


40 and the UKMO model, it is fairly difficult to argue


that, from these figures, there is any type of relation


between LCC and subsidence. The NCEP coupled sim-


ulation results appear fairly random, with large values of


LCC associated with both large positive and negative


values of subsidence (although these events are rare).


9. Conclusions


In this paper an analysis of cloud transitions, in weather


and climate prediction models, in tropical and subtropical


regions is performed. Three-hourly datasets from a vari-


ety of models were used in the context of the GCSS/


WGNE Pacific Cross-section Intercomparison (GPCI)


for the June–July–August 1998 season. The focus is on


studying cloud cover changes from extensive stratocumuli


decks (with high values of cloud cover) to situations


where cumuli (with low values of cloud cover) domi-


nate. This is an important transition in the context of


cloud–climate feedbacks, and characterizing how differ-


ent models simulate this transition is a key task in model


diagnostics.


This study reiterates many of the general concerns in


terms of simulations of clouds and cloud-related pro-


cesses (which apply not only to models but also to re-


analysis such as ERA-40), some of them already reported


in the EUROCS (Siebesma et al. 2004) and other sim-


ilar diagnostic studies. Models tend to underestimate


clouds in the stratocumulus regions, both in cloud cover


(as compared to ISCCP) and liquid water path (as com-


pared to SSM/I), which is reflected in positive shortwave


radiation biases at the surface and top of the atmosphere.


In the deep tropics, ERA-40 (in particular) overestimates


cloud cover, liquid water path, precipitation and (as


a consequence) underestimates the outgoing longwave


radiation.


A major concern is the large spread in the results


between the different models in terms of cloud cover,


liquid water path, and shortwave radiation. Although


all models exhibit a Hadley-like circulation (in terms of


vertical velocity and relative humidity) the differences


between them are substantial, in particular, in terms of


cloud cover and liquid water content vertical structure.


The fact that for cloud-related variables ERA-40 often


produces results that are less realistic than many of the


models is a great illustration of the problems associated


with assimilating cloud-related information in weather


prediction models.


It is important that the models should be able not only


to produce realistic values of mean cloud cover over the


stratocumulus and cumulus regions (which has been his-


torically a major problem for climate and weather pre-


diction models) but also be able to capture some of the


more dynamic features that are discussed in this paper


such as the sharp gradients of cloud cover along the GPCI


cross section and cloud cover histograms in general.


An analysis of the results using these tailored diagnostics


allows one to dig deeper into the reasons for the defi-


ciencies exhibited by the models and to connect these


shortcomings with parameterization methodologies.


Comparing the cloud cover mean statistics obtained by


taking into account sharp gradients in cloud cover along


the GPCI transect, allows one, for example, to determine


that the negative cloud bias of ERA-40 in the stratocu-


mulus regions (as compared to ISCCP) is associated


(i) not only to lower values of cloud cover in these regimes


but also (ii) to a stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition that


occurs too early along the trade-wind Lagrangian tra-


jectory (too much to the northeast).


It is shown that histograms of cloud cover along the


GPCI cross section differ significantly from model to


model. In particular, some models (e.g., UKMO) exhibit


a quasi-bimodal structure with cloud cover being either


close to 100% or close to 0%, while other models (e.g.,


NCAR) show a more continuous transition. The ISCCP


observations show results that are somewhere in-between


these two extreme behaviors. We speculate that these


different patterns reflect the different nature of the


cloud and boundary layer parameterizations, with some


models (e.g., UKMO) basing their parameterizations on


the idea of distinct regimes (with the consequent sharp


transitions between them) while other models base their


parameterizations on ‘‘climatological’’ relations (e.g.,


NCAR).

Description of the Models that Participated
in the GPCI Study


A brief description of the models used in this study is


listed in Table A1 (model acronyms and abbreviations


are listed in Table A2).


APPENDIX B


GPCI Project Protocol


GPCI can be seen as a level-2 model intercomparison


project (Gates 1992) in which all of the participating


models have to follow the same line of predefined project


specifications and protocols: i) simulations made under


standard conditions, ii) common diagnostics in standard


format, and iii) validation against common data.


Though standardized, the specifications were kept at a


relatively generic level with the basic condition being that


the models should run in climate mode (i.e., without data


assimilation) and using prescribed SSTs as a boundary


condition. As the periods of interest were the seasons June–


July–August 1998 and 2003, the simulations started 20 May


1998 and 2003. The requested GPCI output corresponds to


the periods between 1 June and 31 August 1998 and 2003.


Regarding the geographical area of interest, it was


requested that model data should be sent for i) 13 locations


along the GPCI cross section starting at 358N, 1258W and


proceeding southwestward at 48 longitude and 38 latitude


steps to 18S, 1738W and ii) locations every 58 3 58 in a grid


ranging from 258 to 458N, 1608 to 2408E (referred to as


the 2D maps).


Finally, the simulation results were submitted in high


temporal resolution every 3 h at hours 00, 03, 06, 09, 12,


1500, 18, and 21 (UTC) and at full vertical resolution,


that is, on model levels. Note that not all variables were


available from all of the models.

APPENDIX C


Observational Data Used in the GPCI Study


The bulk of the observational data used in this study,


described in Table C1 (see [Table C2 for acronyms and


abbreviations), was retrieved from the GCSS-DIME Web


site in formats prepared for the GPCI project area of


interest: see ‘‘CROSS-PAC’’ and ‘‘GPCI’’ at http://gcss-


dime.giss.nasa.gov/. CERES ES9 data were obtained


from the Atmospheric Science Data Center at the NASA


Langley Research Center (http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/).


The SSM/I data and images are produced by Remote


Sensing Systems (RSS) and sponsored by the NASA


Pathfinder Program for early Earth Observing System


(EOS) products. SSM/I is onboard polar orbiting satel-


lites, property of the Defense Meteorological Satellite


Program (DMSP). Retrievals from three DMSP satellites


carrying SSM/I (F11, F13, and F14) operational during


June–July–August 1998 were used in this study. RSS SSM/


I can be found online at http://www.remss.com/ssmi/ssmi_


description.html.


The GPCP dataset combines precipitation information


from several sources. Microwave estimates are based on


SSM/I, infrared (IR) precipitation estimates are obtained


from geostationary satellites and polar-orbiting satellites,


and gauge data are assembled and analyzed by the Global


Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC).


A hierarchy of geostationary [GOES, geosynchro-


nous meteorological satellite (GMS), Meteosat] and polar


orbiting (NOAA) satellites are used by ISCCP to retrieve


and calculate cloud related products (ISCCP at NASA


GISS available online at http://isccp.giss.nasa.gov/


products/onlineData.html).


A note on the treatment of ISCCP total cloud
cover data


For the total cloud cover calculated from the cloud-top


pressure and cloud optical thickness (PCTAU) dataset,


the IR-only nighttime results for every 3-hourly retrieval


were adjusted by adding the daytime difference between


VIS/IR and IR-only, linearly interpolated between the


dusk and dawn values (a similar procedure was applied


to the retrieved DX data).

ABSTRACT


In this study, the mean and variability of boundary layer height (BLH) are analyzed along a transect in the


eastern Pacific Ocean for the summer of 2003 using BLH estimates based on the height of the main relative


humidity (RH) inversion and the height of low cloud tops (CTH). The observations and the regional and


global model data have been prepared in the context of the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment


(GEWEX) Cloud System Study (GCSS) Pacific Cross-Section Intercomparison (GPCI). The GPCI transect


covers the transition from a stratocumulus-topped marine boundary layer (MBL) off the coast of California to


a trade cumulus–topped, less-well-defined, MBL, and finally to the deep-convection regions in the in-


tertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the Multiangle Im-


aging Spectroradiometer (MISR) have been used to derive observational records of the two BLH estimates.


Analyses from the ECMWF are also used in the study. Both BLH estimates in the models, the ECMWF


analysis, and the observations agree on a southward vertical growth of the MBL along the GPCI transect in


the stratocumulus region. Away from the region typically associated with extensive cloud cover, the two BLH


estimates depict different evolutions of the MBL. In most models, the height of the main RH inversion


decreases southward from ;188N, reaching a minimum at the ITCZ, whereas the height of the RH inversion


in the ECMWF analysis and a few of the models is fairly constant all the way to the ITCZ. As a result of


insufficient vertical resolution of the gridded dataset, the AIRS data only manage to reproduce the initial


growth of the BLH. The median-model CTH increases from the stratocumulus-topped MBL to the ITCZ. In


contrast, the observed MISR CTHs decrease southward from 208N to the ITCZ, possibly indicative of the fact


that in these regions MISR manages to capture a variety of cloud tops with a mean that is below the subsidence


inversion while the models and the ECMWF analysis mainly simulate CTHs corresponding to the height of


the subsidence inversion. In most models and in the ECMWF analysis, the height of the main RH inversion


and the CTH tend to coincide in the northern part of the GPCI transect. In the regions associated with trade


cumuli and deep convection there is a more ambiguous relation between the two BLH estimates. In this


region, most of the models place the CTH above the main RH inversion. The ECMWF analysis shows a good


agreement between the BLH estimates throughout the transect.


1. Introduction


Large persistent decks of low stratiform cloudiness


can be found in the eastern parts of the subtropical


ocean basins (e.g., Klein and Hartmann 1993). Because


of large-scale subsidence and relatively cold waters, the


marine boundary layer (MBL) is normally shallow in

these regions and upside-down convection, generated by


infrared cloud-top cooling, is important for maintaining


the well-mixed MBL. When the air mass of the lower


troposphere is advected equatorward with the trade winds,


it is exposed to increasing sea surface temperatures


(SST) as well as weakening subsidence. The surface


fluxes of heat and moisture increase, and surface-driven


convective updrafts become increasingly important


for maintaining the MBL. As a consequence of these


changes, the depth of the MBL is increasing and the


stratocumulus-topped MBL evolves into a cumulus-topped


MBL (e.g., Bretherton and Wyant 1997; Bretherton et al.


1999).


There is a substantial contrast in cloud radiative forc-


ing between these two cloud regimes (Ramanathan et al.


1989; Hartmann et al. 1992). In the stratocumulus re-


gion the clouds, because of their extensive cloud cover,


strongly influence the top-of-the-atmosphere albedo.


However, because of the relatively small difference be-


tween cloud-top temperature and surface skin temper-


ature these clouds only weakly influence the outgoing


longwave radiation. During the summer, when the in-


solation is large, the surface net cloud radiative cool-


ing in the stratocumulus regime is around 100 W m
22


(Ramanathan et al. 1989). For the cumulus-topped re-


gion the cloud cover is significantly smaller and the


overall influence of these clouds on the radiation budget


is less profound.


In the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s


Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4; Solomon et al.


2007) differences in cloud response in a warmer climate


are attributed to be the primary source of cross-model


variability, and thus uncertainty, of future projections.


Bony and Dufresne (2005) suggested that the main un-


certainty of the cloud feedback, in turn, is associated


with MBL clouds in regions of large-scale subsidence.


The decks of stratocumulus clouds found in the eastern


part of the subtropical ocean basins and the mechanisms


responsible for the breakup into trade wind cumulus


thus have substantial impact on the global climate. This


has been the motivation of several field campaigns—for


example, the First International Satellite Cloud Clima-


tology Project (ISCCP) Regional Experiment (FIRE;


Albrecht et al. 1988), the Atlantic Stratocumulus Tran-


sition Experiment (ASTEX; Albrecht et al. 1995),


the East Pacific Investigation of Climate (EPIC) model


(Bretherton et al. 2004), the Second Dynamics and Chem-


istry of Marine Stratocumulus field study (DYCOMS-II;


Stevens et al. 2003), and Rain in Shallow Cumulus over


the Ocean (RICO; Rauber et al. 2007)—as well as ex-


tensive modeling activities (e.g., Krueger et al. 1995;


Bretherton et al. 1999; Svensson et al. 2000); McCaa and


Bretherton 2004).


Still, the mechanisms responsible for the often abrupt


transition between the cloud regimes are not fully un-


derstood. The concept of a cloud-top entrainment insta-


bility (CTEI) was originally proposed by Lilly (1968) and


was further explored by Randall (1980) and Deardorff


(1980). CTEI would occur when subsaturated air is en-


trained into the stratocumulus-topped MBL. The rela-


tively lighter entrained air is then cooled by evaporation


and might, under certain conditions, become negatively


buoyant. This is hypothesized to positively feed back on


the turbulent entrainment, resulting in the breakup of


the stratus layer. Whether the CTEI feedback is strong


enough to account for the cloud breakup has, however,


recently been questioned (e.g., Yamaguchi and Randall


2008). Other studies indicate that drizzle (e.g., Paluch


and Lenschow 1991) and excess in-cloud latent heat


release over cloud-top radiative cooling (Bretherton


and Wyant 1997) cause a decoupling of the MBL. The


consequence of the decoupling is a decline in the vertical


moisture transport to the cloud layer, which eventually


may cause the stratus layer to break up.


Over subtropical oceans, changes in the depth of the


well-mixed boundary layer, confined by the subsidence


inversion, are associated with mesoscale and large-scale


processes of vertical motion and temperature discrep-


ancies between the advected air mass and the SST. Air


advected equatorward with the trade winds from the


relatively shallow stratocumulus-topped MBL will expe-


rience a vertical growth that is due to increasing en-


trainment of relatively warm and dry free-tropospheric


air into the boundary layer and/or decreasing subsidence.


The simulation of boundary layer clouds in general


circulation models (GCMs) is a notorious challenge for


the modeling community (e.g., Weare 2004; Bony and


Dufresne 2005; Teixeira et al. 2008a; Karlsson et al.


2008). To make reliable model projections of the future


climate it is important that changes occur for the right


reasons. It is therefore necessary, although not suffi-


cient, to have a good representation of the processes


that determine the present-day climate. Evaluating the


representation of the boundary layer height (BLH) in


models offers an integrated way of evaluating the chain


of processes that affects the MBL. The BLH is controlled


by physical processes on a wide range of scales and also


has a close connection to the type of cloud regime and


thus to the cloud forcing on the climate.


There are operational, surface-based, methods to de-


termine the height of the boundary layer [see Seibert


et al. (2000) for a review]. However, in remote regions


knowledge on the vertical extent of the boundary layer


stems from field campaigns and satellite estimates. Al-


though field campaigns are crucial, they are limited


both in time and space. The increasing sophistication of


1846 J O U R N A L O F A P P L I E D M E T E O R O L O G Y A N D C L I M A T O L O G Y VOLUME 49







satellite instrumentation opens up new possibilities to


increase our knowledge of the boundary layer. In re-


gions where BLH coincides with the cloud-top height


(CTH) of low clouds (i.e., stratocumulus regions), esti-


mates of BLH can be derived from satellite-retrieved


cloud-top heights (e.g., Minnis et al. 1992; Ahlgrimm


and Randall 2006; Wood and Bretherton 2004; Zuidema


et al. 2009). Most of these studies derive the CTHs by


combining low-level cloud-top temperatures retrieved


from passive satellite IR sensors with SSTs and lapse


rates. These IR-derived CTH estimates do, however,


depend on several more or less empirically assured as-


sumptions regarding, for example, the lapse rate valid


for the whole well-mixed MBL and the near-surface


temperature and humidity. In addition, the presence of


temperature inversions complicates CTH retrieval since


the temperature profiles will have the same temperature


at two or more levels. Nevertheless, the BLH derived


from IR retrievals has proven successful in regional


evaluations (e.g., Minnis et al. 1992; Stevens et al. 2007).


Some recent studies (e.g., Ahlgrimm and Randall 2006;


Lin et al. 2009) have instead utilized active spaceborne


lidars to estimate the BLH from CTHs in the stratocu-


mulus regions. The advantage of active sensors is that


they provide direct measurements of the CTHs. The rel-


atively poor spatial and temporal sampling is the down-


side. For the period analyzed in this study no spaceborne


lidar data are available.


Other studies have utilized satellite retrievals to iden-


tify the vertical location of the inversion in temperature


and moisture that typically caps the boundary layer. To


mention a couple, Fetzer et al. (2004) used Atmospheric


Infrared Sounder (AIRS) data to identify the subsidence


inversion off the coast of Baja California and von Engeln


et al. (2005) estimated a global distribution of planetary


boundary layer height from radio occultation data.


In this study, we analyze the mean and variability of


BLH along a transect in the eastern Pacific Ocean (see


Fig. 1) in models and observations. The transect covers


the transition from a stratocumulus-topped MBL off


the coast of California to a trade cumulus–topped, less


defined, MBL, and finally to the deep convection in the


ITCZ as shown schematically in Fig. 2. In deriving the


BLH two different estimates are used. The first esti-


mate is the height of the maximum vertical gradient of


relative humidity (RH) with respect to pressure. Since


the RH is both temperature and moisture dependent it

is a well-suited variable for deriving the height of the


subsidence inversion. The second estimate is the CTH


of low clouds. In the stratus regime, cloud-top cooling


acts to preserve the subsidence inversion, and therefore


the two BLH estimates are expected to coincide in this


region. In the trade wind cumulus–topped MBL the


cumulus clouds are the result of convective updrafts,


generated by turbulent surface heat fluxes or mass con-


vergence in the lowest layers of the atmosphere, which


penetrate through the conditionally unstable layer above


the mixed layer. The vertical extent of the convective


updrafts depends on the energy input at the surface as


well as the vertical distribution of moisture and tem-


perature in the lower troposphere. Thus, there is no a


priori reason for these two BLH estimates to coincide in


the trade wind cumulus regime and even less in the


proximity of the ITCZ. Still, the individual BLH esti-


mates contain relevant information on the state of the


MBL and the boundary layer clouds, information that


could be applicable when evaluating GCMs. The benefit


of the two BLH estimates is that they enable a relatively


straightforward comparison between models and satellite


observations.


2. Method and data


Model and observational data are from the Global


Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Cloud


System Study (GCSS) Pacific Cross-Section Inter-


comparison (GPCI; Teixeira et al. 2008b, 2010, manu-


script submitted to J. Climate). The intention of GPCI


is to provide a relatively simple framework to evaluate


models against observations. The Pacific cross section is


roughly aligned parallel to the trade winds and stretches


from 358N, 1258W in the northeast to 18S, 1738W in the


southwest (Fig. 1). The summer climatological low-level


cloud fraction (Fig. 1) shows a smooth transition from


extensive cloud cover in the stratocumulus region to


smaller cloud cover in the trade wind cumuli region and


equatorward (from ISCCP ‘‘D2’’ data; Rossow and


Schiffer 1999). This smooth transition is largely a statis-


tical feature; the transition is often abrupt in its nature


(e.g., Teixeira et al. 2010, manuscript submitted to


J. Climate). On occasion, actinoform clouds form in


connection with the stratocumulus-to-cumulus transi-


tion (Garay et al. 2004). Siebesma et al. (2004) carried


out an intercomparison of cloud representation along


this Pacific cross section in GCMs. One of the main


conclusions of their study was that most models sub-


stantially overestimated (underestimated) the down-


welling surface radiation in the stratocumulus (trade wind


cumuli) regime. The GPCI study involves more models


and has a broader target and finer temporal resolution.


The period studied in our analysis is June, July, and


August (JJA) of 2003. As a quasi-observational record,


analyses (model version CY26R3) from the European


Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)


are used.


a. Observations


1) MULTIANGLE IMAGING SPECTRORADIOMETER


The Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR)


instrument on board the sun-synchronous polar-orbiting


Terra satellite has nine cameras that view the earth at


different angles. The operational retrieval of CTHs re-


sorts to stereo-matching algorithms that coregister re-


flectivity patterns of different images (Muller et al. 2002)


and to geometrical considerations that translate the total


disparity (apparent distance) of each stereo-matched cloud


element to cloud motion and CTH (Zong et al. 2002).


In the analysis, the MISR level-2 wind-corrected cloud-


top-height product (Moroney et al. 2002; Davies et al.


2007) is used. The MISR CTHs have a horizontal reso-


lution of 1 3 1 km2 and a nominal accuracy of 6560 m


(Moroney et al. 2002). For low-level clouds the statisti-


cal error is smaller, approximately 6300 m (Naud et al.


2004; Garay et al. 2008). The MISR CTHs are extracted


for 38 latitude 3 48 longitude boxes centered at the


transect grid points, and only cloud tops below 3000 m


are considered. The number of MISR orbits during JJA


2003 with good registration quality varies between 12


and 23 for the individual transect boxes (rightmost


numbers in Fig. 1). Because of problems in retriev-


ing good-quality cloud movement vectors (winds), the


number of passages with wind-corrected CTHs is lower.


Well-organized cloud scenes with sufficient contrast


are favorable conditions for successful retrieval of cloud


motion (Moroney et al. 2002). Scenes with relatively


homogenous stratocumulus decks or scattered trade wind


cumuli thus pose more of a challenge for the retrieval


algorithm. This is illustrated in the lower number of orbits


with retrieved wind-corrected low CTHs (,3000 m),


which varies between 5 and 19 along the transect (left-


most numbers in Fig. 1). Because the cloud-movement


retrieval is sensitive to the cloud scene itself, a potential


cloud-sampling bias cannot be excluded. The descending


node’s equatorial crossing time for the sun-synchronous


Terra satellite is about 1030 local solar time. The tem-


poral sampling unfortunately rules out analysis of the


diurnal cycle. One advantage with the MISR instrument


is the stereophotogrammetric cloud-top height retrieval,


which, in contrast to infrared instruments, requires no


information on the atmospheric state (Garay et al. 2008).


With the relatively fine horizontal resolution of the in-


strument comes a limited spatial coverage.

Previous studies have shown the retrieved MISR CTHs


to be in good agreement with in situ observations in the


stratocumulus regime (Garay et al. 2008) and with other


remote sensing data in the trade wind cumulus regime


(Genkova et al. 2007).


For the comparison with the GPCI model results,


MISR CTHs are converted to pressure by using reanal-


ysis data from the National Centers for Environmental


Prediction (NCEP; Kalnay et al. 1996). First, the spatial


average MISR CTHs are calculated for the 38 3 48 cross-


sectional boxes. The NCEP geopotential and temperature


fields are then interpolated bilinearly to be representative


at the transect point. Third, the MISR cloud-top pressure is


derived by assuming a constant lapse rate and hydrostatic


balance between the NCEP reanalysis levels that enclose


the mean MISR CTHs.


2) THE ATMOSPHERIC INFRARED SOUNDER


With more than 2000 spectral channels, the AIRS in-


strument provides information on the vertical distribu-


tion of water vapor and temperature (and thus relative


humidity) in the atmosphere (Aumann et al. 2003; Chahine


et al. 2006). The AIRS instrument is on board the polar-


orbiting sun-synchronous Aqua satellite, which crosses


the equator at approximately 1330 and 0130 local solar


time on the ascending and descending node, respec-


tively. In this study we use the horizontally gridded,


daily, level-3, standard retrieval, version-4.0 data on


pressure levels. The pressure levels located in the lower


troposphere and considered in this analysis are 1000,


925, 850, and 700 hPa. Over the ocean, the AIRS re-


trievals have been validated to be accurate within 1 K


for 1-km-layer averages and to 15% for 2-km-layer aver-


ages for temperature and humidity, respectively (Fetzer


2005).


Fetzer et al. (2004) utilized AIRS retrievals to de-


scribe the subsidence-related temperature inversion and


the height-resolved water vapor field over the subtrop-


ical Pacific Ocean. The temperature inversions showed


good agreement with ECMWF model analyses, and, rel-


ative to operational radiosondes in the region, the height-


resolved moisture field showed small biases in the lower


troposphere.


As also discussed in Fetzer et al. (2004), two issues


should be taken into consideration when using AIRS


data to study the lower troposphere. First, the AIRS re-


trieval accuracy is sensitive to the cloud cover and only


for infrared effective cloud fractions (i.e., the emissivity


multiplied by the cloud fraction) of less than 70% is the


retrieval successful. This evidently has implications for


the yield in regions of extensive cloudiness. The biased


sampling related to the cloud cover sensitivity of the


AIRS retrievals has been shown to introduce a moist


bias in terms of the total precipitable water vapor


(PWV) in the stratocumulus regions (Fetzer et al. 2006).


In the subtropics, which are characterized by dry free-


tropospheric air, the PWV is expected to be indicative of


the height of the well-mixed MBL. The moist bias in


terms of PWV in the AIRS data for the stratocumulus


regions could then imply that the biased sampling to-


ward smaller cloudiness is associated with an over-


sampling of relatively deeper MBL. Second, the coarse


vertical resolution of the AIRS dataset rules out analysis


of finer vertical structures. The ECMWF analyses as-


similate radiances from AIRS (McNally et al. 2006).


b. Models


In Table 1 the model centers and model versions in-


cluded in the analysis are listed. The models that con-


tribute data to the GPCI project but do not have all


necessary variables to derive the BLH estimates (a small


subset of all models that contribute data to the GPCI


project) are excluded from the analysis. The model sim-


ulations were conducted with prescribed SSTs. The sur-


face temperature of the ocean is crucial for the evolution


of the MBL along the transect. Thus, for a fair compari-


son of modeled boundary layer and cloud-height evolu-


tion, prescribed SSTs are a necessity. As reference, Fig. 3


shows reanalyzed SSTs along the GPCI transect from


NCEP. The simulated atmospheric fields are reported as


3-hourly snapshots except the radiative and turbulent


fluxes, which are reported as 3-h means. The analysis


is performed on model levels. The modelers have used


different interpolation techniques when reporting the


data at the horizontal points of the transect. The models


do have different horizontal and vertical resolutions;


however, regardless of these differences all model re-


sults are analyzed in the same way.


Both BLH estimates are derived from the model data.


In the process of deriving the low-cloud-top pressure in


the models, the following steps/assumptions are made:


1) model levels with gridbox-mean cloud condensate


of ,0.01 g kg
21


are treated as cloud free, 2) only low-


cloud-top scenes in which no high or medium high


clouds are present (.3000 m or ,700 hPa) have been


used, 3) the simulated boundary layer clouds have


been assumed to be maximally overlapped when cal-


culating cloud-top pressure, and 4) the cloud tops in


the models and in the ECMWF analysis have been


assumed to be located at the half-level above the reg-


ular model level.


A threshold on the simulated cloud condensate (step


1) is necessary because satellites have a lowest detect-


able limit. A couple of models also exhibit ‘‘empty


clouds’’—that is, they have cloud fraction but virtually


no condensate. The choice of cloud condensate threshold


SEPTEMBER 2010 K A R L S S O N E T A L . 1849







has little impact on the cloud-top pressure in terms of the


across-model variability and mean model value. How-


ever, the number of identified low-cloud-top scenes


is highly sensitive to the choice of cloud condensate


threshold. Using a too-large threshold leads to model


levels being erroneously treated as cloud free and de-


creases the number of low-cloud-top pressures derived.


On the other hand, using a too-small threshold also de-


creases the number of derived low-cloud-top pressures


since a smaller number of optically thin high clouds are


filtered out by the algorithm. The choice of 0.01 g kg21


optimizes the number of low-cloud-top scenes identified


while not increasing the cloud-free scenes. Because high


cloud tops (e.g., deep convection towers or frontal and


cirrus clouds) are not representative of the boundary


layer, these are excluded from the analysis (step 2). For


the remaining cloud scenes—those containing low clouds


with enough condensate—the mean cloud-top pressure


pcloud is derived, assuming the clouds reported at the


model levels to be maximally overlapped:

where fi is the cloud fraction at model level i, fmaxi is the


largest model level cloud fraction, pi is the pressure of


the model half-level, and di is a unit step function, which


is unity if the model level cloud fraction exceeds the


previously largest cloud fraction and zero otherwise.


The sums are calculated from above; the lower bound of


summation (i 5 1) thus corresponds to the uppermost


model half-level below 700 hPa (;3000 m) classified as


cloudy, and the upper bound of summation (i 5 n)


corresponds to the model level closest to the surface. For


example, a scene with a cloud fraction of 30% at 800 hPa


and of 50% at 900 hPa results in a mean cloud-top pres-


sure of 840 hPa while a scene with a cloud fraction of 50%


at 800 hPa and of 30% at 900 hPa results in a mean cloud-


top pressure of 800 hPa.


The BLH estimate based on the height of the maxi-


mum vertical RH gradient with respect to pressure is


derived in the following way. First the differences in RH


between adjacent model layers are divided by the cor-


responding differences in pressure. These discrete gra-


dients are most representative at the midlevel pressures.


The reported BLH estimate is accordingly the pressure

and 700 hPa, is found.


3. Results and discussion


The vertical distributions of all 1 3 1 km2 MISR


CTHs retrieved during JJA 2003 for the northern part of


the transect (328–208N) are shown in Fig. 4. This part of


the GPCI transect comprises the region of solid stratus


as well as where the stratus-to-cumulus transition (SCT)


in general occurs. The distributions have been normal-


ized by the total number of samples at each transect


point. The mean cloud-top height increases as one moves


southward, from 969 m at 328N to 1806 m at 208N. This


indicates a comparable increase in the mean BLH since


the cloud-top height is expected, at least in the stratocu-


mulus region, to coincide with the subsidence inversion


and thus represent the BLH. While the mean cloud-top


height increases southward, the distributions also widen


during the SCT (Fig. 4), indicative of a weakening of


the subsidence inversion and warmer SSTs enhancing


the turbulent surface fluxes and convective updrafts. Al-


though the seasonal trend in SST during the analyzed


period is larger in the northern part of the GPCI transect


(Fig. 3), possibly implying a similar behavior of the CTH


variability, the widening of the distributions (Fig. 4)


rather indicates that more convective situations are as-


sociated with larger variability.


The fact that the distributions tend to be multimodal is


partly attributable to temporal variability in the retrieved


CTHs between different MISR overpasses (not shown).


This is especially true for the 238 and 208N points (Fig. 4),


which only have a modest number of overpasses (5 and 7,


respectively) with retrieved wind-corrected CTHs. For


the boxes centered at 328, 298, and 268N the numbers of


satellite passages with retrieved wind-corrected CTHs


during JJA 2003 are 16, 15, and 14, respectively (see


leftmost numbers in Fig. 1). Multilayer cloud scenes are


a challenge for the MISR wind retrieval (Moroney et al.


2002), and an increased number of these events at 238 and


208N as well as a smaller number of good-quality orbits


could be the reason why fewer overpasses have wind-


corrected CTHs.


Figure 5a shows the modeled and observed BLH es-


timate based on the pressure at which the maximum


vertical RH gradient with respect to pressure is found as


a function of latitude along the transect. In Fig. 5b the


latitudinal evolution of the BLH estimate in each of


the individual models is shown. All individual models,


the ECMWF analysis, and the AIRS data show an ex-


pected southward increase in this BLH estimate from


358 to 208N. This is also the part of the transect where the


most solid cloud deck is found (cloud cover above 50%;


see Fig. 1) and where the stratus-to-cumulus transition is


expected to take place. The median-model ensemble


value shows a good agreement with the ECMWF anal-


ysis in this region (and with AIRS from 358 to around


258N), where the BLH evolves, according to the vertical


location of the main RH inversion, from around 950 hPa


at 358N to around 850 hPa at 208N. These values are


consistent with previous observational estimates from in


situ measurements (Schubert et al. 1995) and GPS radio


occultation satellite observations (von Engeln et al.


2005). Despite the apparent good agreement in terms of


the median-model ensemble, the variability between


models in mean BLH is too large: at places the differ-


ence between the maximum and minimum model values


is as large as the BLH itself.


The median-model BLH estimate based on the RH


inversion (Fig. 5a) decreases southward from 188N and


reaches a minimum at the ITCZ, which during the an-


alyzed period is located around 58–108N. However, a


couple of models as well as the ECMWF analysis show


a fairly constant BLH from 188N to the ITCZ (Fig. 5b).


An important characteristic of the evolution of BLH


is the fact that there is little change south of around 208N


in the ECMWF analysis, AIRS, and a couple of models.


Again this is consistent with some previous observations


(von Engeln et al. 2005) and was highlighted by Schubert


et al. (1995) to contrast previous perceptions of a more


dramatic deepening of the trade wind inversion equa-


torward (see, e.g., Fig. 14.7 in Emanuel 1994). The lower


and close-to-constant values of the BLH south of 208N


in the AIRS data (Fig. 5a) can be mostly attributed to


the coarse vertical resolution of this particular dataset


version. The fact that data show the trade wind inversion


to be found almost exclusively between 925 and 850 hPa


FIG. 3. NCEP SSTs along the transect during JJA 2003. Black

south of 208N still opens up for considerable BLH growth


and variability not resolved by the gridded AIRS data-


set. A preliminary case study in the trade wind boundary


layer shows that it is possible to improve the retrieved


vertical structure of temperature and RH in the lower


troposphere using the high-vertical-resolution AIRS sup-


port retrieval product (J. Martins 2009, personal com-


munication). However, a more extensive analysis of the


AIRS support retrieval product is outside the scope of


this study.


Note that, while models show different evolutions of


the BLH estimate based on the height of the main RH


inversion, all models and observations agree in a de-


crease of the RH inversion strength toward the ITCZ


(not shown).


The model median and ECMWF analysis temporal


variability of the BLH estimate show good agreement


along the transect (Fig. 5c). The increase of variability


toward the ITCZ is likely a combination of weaker


subsidence inversions and a larger variability in the


strength of the convective updrafts. The southward de-


crease in the seasonal cycle amplitude of the prescribed


SSTs (Fig. 3) is not reflected in the variability of the


BLH estimate based on the RH gradient. The differ-


ences between the models in terms of the temporal


variability of the BLH is again substantial and is a cause


for concern, with some models showing variability


values that are almost 5 times as large as others. Ac-


cording to AIRS, variability of the RH-based BLH es-


timate is, more or less, nonexistent south of 208N (Fig.


5c). This is most likely attributable to the coarse vertical


resolution of the AIRS dataset, although the absence of


diurnal variability in the AIRS data also should con-


tribute to the lower variability.


The simulated and observed BLH estimates based on


low-cloud-top height are shown in Fig. 6. Described


previously in section 2a(1), MISR 1 3 1 km2 low CTHs


are spatially averaged over 38 3 48 boxes centered at the


transect points (Fig. 1) for a more fair comparison with


the model data. The median model, the ECMWF anal-


ysis, and the MISR data all show an increase in CTH


from 358 to 208N (Fig. 6a), in line with the RH inversion


estimate. In a stratocumulus-topped MBL the two BLH


estimates are expected to coincide because the vertical


growth of the cloud is limited by the inversion. Ac-


cording to the ECMWF analysis and the model median


the cloud-top height then increases farther south of 208N


to the ITCZ (;58–108N). This is in contrast to the MISR


results that instead show a decrease in low-level CTH


for the same stretch of the transect. The region from


208N to the ITCZ is typically associated with trade wind


cumuli and deep convection. We speculate that the CTH


decrease seen in the MISR data is connected to the


decoupling of the MBL and the transition to a cumulus-


topped boundary layer. When the MBL becomes de-


coupled, a weakly stable transition layer separates the


surface mixed layer from the layer capped by the sub-


sidence inversion. A large majority of the convective


plumes do not have enough energy to reach the sub-


sidence inversion. This results in a multitude of small


cumuli with cloud tops below the subsidence inversion.


A small number of more energetic convective plumes


manage to penetrate through the transition layer and


reach the subsidence inversion and above. This pre-


dominance of relatively shallow and small cumuli with


cloud tops beneath the subsidence inversion has been


documented in several recent studies (e.g., Genkova


et al. 2007; Zhao and Di Girolamo 2007). The discrep-


ancy between the MISR and the model and analysis


results (Fig. 6a) probably illustrates the essential dif-


ference between what is being observed by MISR and


what is being simulated by the models and the ECMWF


analysis. The models (and the ECMWF analysis) are


trying to represent cloud cover and mean liquid water


content in grid boxes with sizes on the order of 100 3


100 km2. On the other hand, MISR CTHs retrievals

CTH are 50 m. Solid and dashed black lines represent the mean and median of the CTH distributions, respectively.

have resolutions on the order of 1 km and are as such


able to detect a variety of cumulus clouds, which pre-


sumably have tops at several different heights. In prac-


tice, it appears that the models (and the ECMWF


analysis) are mostly capturing a CTH that roughly cor-


responds to the top of the boundary layer while MISR is


able to capture a variety of cumulus cloud tops with


a mean that is below the boundary layer depth. Note,


however, that this could also partly be an artifact of too


few satellite passages with wind-retrieved low cloud tops.


The CTH temporal variability of the models and the


ECMWF analysis is in relatively good agreement with


the MISR observations (Fig. 6c). There is a weaker


latitudinal dependence on the variability of the BLH


estimate based on CTH than is the case for the RH


gradient estimate. The variability is also in general smaller


for the low-cloud-top pressure than for the BLH estimate


based on the RH gradient. There is an interesting de-


pendence on the cloud regimes: in the stratocumulus re-


gion the variability in the height of the RH inversion and


CTH is very similar, with values of around 30–40 hPa,


whereas in the deep convection regions the variability


of the RH inversion height is almost 2 times the corre-


sponding values for the CTH.


Figure 7 shows mean versus temporal variability (1


standard deviation) of the two BLH estimates at dif-


ferent points along the transect for the individual models


and observations. The mean model variability for both


BLH estimates increases toward the ITCZ (;58–108N),


and the across-model spread shows the same tendency.


In the region typically associated with stratus clouds, the


models show internal consistency and better agreement


with the observations with respect to the mean and the


temporal variability of both BLH estimates when com-


pared with regions associated with trade wind cumulus


and deep convection. The ECMWF analysis mean and


variability of the BLH estimates stay relatively close to


the model mean values. As discussed earlier, because of


the poor vertical resolution of the dataset AIRS is not


able to produce realistic results because of poor reso-


lution in the cumulus- and deep convection–dominated


regions.

In Fig. 8, the two BLH estimates for each individual


model, the ECMWF analysis, and the observations are


plotted against each other. The different shades of gray


of the markers indicate the geographical location of the


points along the GPCI transect. Data points on the right


(left) side of the 1-to-1 line indicate that the mean cloud-


top height is below (above) the main RH inversion.


From the diagram it is evident that the estimates show


better agreement in the northern (stratocumulus) part


of the transect (darker shades of gray), both for models


and for observations. Here, the majority of the models


produce CTHs at a slightly lower altitude than inversion


heights, which is what is expected for a stratocumulus-


topped MBL. At lower latitudes where convective


updrafts are more important for maintaining the MBL


and the subsidence inversion is significantly weaker,


a majority of the models depict CTHs that extend higher


than the height of the main vertical RH gradient. This


may well be because of the decrease in the altitude of


the main RH inversion that most models appear to have


in the deep convection region (Figs. 5a,b), which is


not consistent with previous observations or with the


ECMWF analysis. In the presence of boundary layers


that are not well mixed, the cloud-base RH inversion


may be comparable in strength to that of the boundary


layer inversion (e.g., Zeng et al. 2004). This could be the


reason why several models show a decrease in the alti-


tude of the main RH inversion equatorward where the


subsidence inversion weakens. A few models show the


opposite behavior, placing the low cloud tops at a lower


altitude than the main RH inversion (Fig. 8). In the


particular case of the ECMWF analysis, the two esti-


mates, CTH and BLH, show a remarkably good agree-


ment along the whole stretch of the transect. Although it


would be nice to assume that this is a realistic behavior,


it is still not clear how many of the characteristics of the


ECMWF analysis are model dependent (as opposed to


relying fundamentally on the observations being as-


similated). In this context, it is important to remind the


reader that very few of the observations being assimi-


lated in the ECMWF analysis have a direct impact on


the tropical and subtropical cloudy boundary layer over


the ocean. In particular, 1) there are virtually no radio-


sonde observations in the region, 2) the infrared sounding


information being assimilated is for noncloudy (clear)


situations, and 3) the sensitivity of infrared and micro-


wave observations to the cloudy boundary layer vertical


structure is negligible.

4. Summary and conclusions


In the framework of GPCI (Teixeira et al. 2008b,


Teixeira et al. 2010, manuscript submitted to J. Climate)


we analyze the boundary layer height evolution in models


and observations in a situation in which the lower atmo-


sphere is advected, by the prevailing northeasterly trade


winds, from a typically stratocumulus-topped MBL off


the coast of California to a trade cumulus–topped MBL


and farther south to the deep convective regions of the


ITCZ.


In this study, satellite-based observations are utilized


to estimate the boundary layer height over this remote


ocean area. From these datasets, two proxies for bound-


ary layer height have been defined: 1) the pressure at the


level at which the maximum vertical gradient (with re-


spect to pressure) of RH is found and 2) the cloud-top


pressure of low clouds. These estimates enable a rela-


tively straightforward comparison between models and


satellite observations. AIRS and MISR retrievals have


been used as a satellite record for the proxies based


on the RH inversion and low-cloud-top pressure, re-


spectively. Analysis results from ECMWF for the area


are also used in this context. The period studied is June–


August 2003.


The observational data and the models, including the


ECMWF analysis, clearly show an increase in boundary


layer height (most pronounced in the northernmost


part) along the GPCI transect from the stratocumulus


regions toward the equator. The two observational es-


timates agree well on the magnitude of the depth of the


boundary layer in the stratocumulus region and the


intermodel variability as well as that the observational


variability is the smallest in this region. Farther south,


the two methods of estimating the boundary layer height


show less agreement. Most likely, the AIRS data un-


derestimate the boundary layer height south of 208N,


with very little variability (mainly because of a lack of


vertical resolution of this particular AIRS product),


whereas the MISR data depict a decrease in cloud-top


height to the shallowest observed layers close to the


equator. We speculate that the different evolution in the


CTH of MISR, the models, and the ECMWF analysis


south of 208N highlights the difference in what is being


observed by MISR and what is being simulated by


the models and the ECMWF analysis. The horizontal

resolution on which the models and the ECMWF anal-


ysis represent cloud fraction and cloud liquid content is


on the order of 100 3 100 km2 while the resolution of


the MISR instrument is on the order of 1 3 1 km2.


With regard to both absolute value and temporal


variability, the models show better agreement internally


and when compared with observations in the northern


part of the transect, which typically is associated with an


extensive area of stratocumulus, than in the southern


regions normally associated with shallow cumulus and


cumulus. The models show more variability in the


boundary layer height estimate based on the RH in-


version than in the estimate defined from the low-cloud-


top height. A possible reason for the larger variability in


the RH inversion–based estimate might be that it oscil-


lates between the subsidence inversion and a potentially


strong cloud-base RH inversion that may be present in


boundary layers that are not well mixed. When advected


southward along the transect, the air experiences in-


creased buoyancy fluxes, eventually creating a convective


background state. In practice, models have different


parameterizations for different types of clouds and dif-


ferent rules for when and how these parameterizations


are combined. For convective situations the interplay of


parameterizations in distributing the buoyant energy is


important for the state of the boundary layer. The lesser


agreement between models in the region typically associ-


ated with shallow cumulus and cumulus might thus be


related to a more complex and subjective interplay of the


increased number of parameterizations contributing to the


vertical redistribution of humidity and temperature for


atmospheric states in which deep convection might occur.


The fact that the growth of the MBL along the GPCI


transect depicted from the BLH estimates in both


models and observations is less dramatic agrees with


the result of Schubert et al. (1995) rather than previous


ideas, suggesting a steeper increase in the height of the


MBL from the trade wind cumulus region to the ITCZ


(e.g., Emanuel 1994, see his Fig. 14.7).


This study presents feasible methods of how satellite-


based observational techniques can be used for evalu-


ating the boundary layer height in large-scale models

vertical RH gradient are on the y axis. The grayscale indicates the latitude along the transect.

over remote oceans. These methods and datasets could


also be applied to evaluate the performance of cloud-


resolving models and large-eddy simulations. Boundary


layer height is a variable that can be viewed as an in-


tegrated result of a series of processes that are important


for the air–sea exchange and radiative properties of the


clouds in this region. By using satellite observations, the


possibility to extend this method to cover large portions


of the oceans can make a contribution to the evaluation of


climate models and subsequently to their improvement.

GPCI analyzes weather and climate models along a cross section of the Pacific Ocean. Histograms of total cloud cover versus latitude 
along the GPCI cross section for June–July–August 1998 from the UKMO/HadGAM model, ISCCP and the NCAR/CAM3 model. 
These show that some climate models (e.g., UKMO/HadGAM) exhibit a quasi-bimodal structure with cloud cover being either close to 
100 percent or close to zero, while other climate models (e.g., NCAR/CAM3) show a more continuous transition. See article below.

Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment


Before I reflect on my 8-year term 
as the GEWEX Scientific Steering 
Group (SSG) Chair, I would like to  
express my appreciation for a num-
ber of people who have made my 
term a most rewarding and educa-
tional experience. Paul Try, as the  
first International GEWEX Proj-
ect Office (IGPO) Director, suc-
ceeded by Rick Lawford, are perhaps 


two of the most intelligent, remarkable, and yet humble 
individuals I had the pleasure of working with. I learned 
so much from them during these past years that shar-
ing the experiences would fill a book. The energy level of  
Peter van Oevelen, the new IGPO Director, has not only re-
energized me during these last months of my chairmanship, 
but has also reassured me that the GEWEX community has 
been so fortunate as to attract some of the most dedicated 
and talented colleagues to direct the IGPO. While Directors 
and SSG chairs have come and gone, Dawn Erlich has been 
the anchor and most loyal and caring guardian GEWEX has 
had over the years. I am also grateful to my assistant, Diane 
Hohnbaum at University of California-Irvine for her help 
and service over the past 5 years.


Needless to say, I have also had the pleasure of working with 
an outstanding group of panel and working group chairs 
and hundreds of volunteers, including all the SSG members 
over the years. My thanks go to all of you, and my apologies 
that I cannot mention everyone by name in this commen-
tary. (The GEWEX News Editorial Board would not allow 
me the space!)


I had the good fortune of becoming the second SSG Chair 
after a remarkable tenure by our colleague Moustafa “Mous” 
Chahine of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Under Mous’ lead-
ership the GEWEX program truly flourished, as best docu-
mented in the GEWEX Phase I (1990–2002) report. The  
accomplishments of our various panels, including widely-used 
data sets such as the International Satellite Cloud Climatol-
ogy Project (ISCCP) by the GEWEX Radiation Panel (GRP); 
contributions by the GEWEX Modelling and Prediction 
Panel (GMPP) such as the Project for the Intercomparison 
of Land-Surface Parameterization Schemes and the GEWEX 
Cloud System Study; and the accomplishments of the Con-
tinental-Scale Experiments (CSEs) initiated by the GEWEX 
Hydrometeorology Panel (GHP), are just a few examples. 


We started Phase II of GEWEX with each of our three panels 
(GRP, GMPP and GHP) to address the critical challenging 


Commentary

Chairman of the GEWEX SSG

Chair, GEWEX Scientific Steering Group


scientific questions that were identified in Phase I and the 
initiation of the Coordinated Enhanced Observation Period 
(CEOP). Most recently, CEOP was merged with GHP and 
transformed into the new Coordinated Energy Water Cycle 
Observations Project (also CEOP) under the leadership of 
Toshio Koike and the late John Roads. 


Perhaps one of the most interesting experiences of chair-
ing the SSG has been the appreciation I have gained for 
the wide range of scientific questions and activities that 
the GEWEX program is addressing. None of us, no mat-
ter how broadly we are educated, can expect to be an ex-
pert in all aspects of the GEWEX program. During the past  
8 years, even though I have been exposed to a wide range 
of topics under the GEWEX umbrella, in no way can I 
claim that I have become an expert in all aspects. One thing 
is certain however: the duties of the SSG Chair force one 
to “think outside the box” (in my case, hydrology). Dur-
ing my term as Chairman, I have heard comments such as 
“GEWEX has become a purely land-hydrology activity” as 
well as comments from many of my hydrology colleagues 
that “GEWEX has not paid as much attention to the land-
hydrology aspects.” For better or worse, the complexities of 
multidisciplinary projects such as GEWEX require a bal-
anced approach, and therefore one should not expect an  
optimal outcome based on one’s disciplinary point of view. 


Throughout the years we have maintained that GEWEX 
should “Stay the Course” and minimize reorganizing itself 
to focus on the science and observation issues that are the 
core of the panel activities. I still feel strongly that this is 
the best approach to produce the desired outcomes; let me 
elaborate using the critical issue of prediction as an example. 
Prediction of future climate scenarios at various scales has 
been a key focus of the World Climate Research Programme 
(WCRP) and in more recent years has been highly empha-
sized. Much of the recent emphasis is perhaps due to the In-
tergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) process. 
While the IPCC has mainly focused on climate models at 
the global scale, it is becoming more apparent that the issue 
of regional-scale predictions will be dominant in the next 
round of IPCC assessments. As a result, any downscaling to 
regional scales will require some degree of testing and vali-
dation with real data. Therefore, the role for the GEWEX 
program is crucial, not only because of its long-term focus 
on providing global observations, but also for its role in con-
ducting process and modelling studies at the scales required 
for the finer spatial and temporal resolutions. 


Only time will tell, but I nevertheless predict that the impor-
tance of the GEWEX program will only grow as we move 
forward into the future. I am sure under the leadership of 
the incoming chair, Thomas Ackerman, and in cooperation 
with the WCRP programs, particularly the Climate Vari-
ability and Predictability Project, the GEWEX program will 
remain a core activity that benefits the international com-
munity currently faced with addressing the uncertainties 
associated with the impact of climate change on resources 
such as water.

In Memoriam
Dr. Christopher Bishop (formerly Brest), NASA Goddard 
Institute for Space Studies, passed away on 10 August 2008. 
He supported GEWEX Projects for many years, especially the 
International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP).
Chris started work at the ISCCP Global Processing Center 
in 1983, shortly after routine data collection began, and took 
over early tasks involved with quality checking all of these 
data. However, when it was realized that the polar orbiting 
satellite imagers (AVHRR) which serve as the ISCCP radi-
ance calibration reference standard needed to be calibrated 
and monitored, Chris quickly stepped into this key role. The 
calibration problem was a huge undertaking because of the 
large number of radiometers. His work achieved the first, and 
still only, comprehensive and consistent absolute calibration 
of all the radiometers in the entire constellation of operational 
weather satellites. Chris also built a quality-checking system 
that monitored the ISCCP cloud products to detect smaller 
calibration discrepancies. Since new radiometers were contin-
ually being introduced into the satellite observing system, this 
work continued to occupy much of Chris’ time. Chris will be 
missed as a colleague and friend. 


Dr. Taikan Oki of the Institute of Industrial Science at the 
University of Tokyo was selected as a recipient of the 2007 
Japan Society for the Promotion of Science PRIZE, an 
award given to young researchers “with fresh ideas who have 
the potential to become world leaders in their fields.” Of 
the 23 PRIZE recipients, 5 researchers were singled out to 
receive the prestigious Japan Academy Medal; Dr. Oki was 
given the honor of addressing Their Imperial Highnesses 
Prince and Princess Akishino on behalf of himself and his 
colleagues. His research subject is “Predicting the Variations 
of Global Hydrological Cycles and the Balance of World 
Water Resources.”

Results from the First 2 Years of GPCI

weather and climate prediction models. The approach used 
by GPCI builds on the EUROpean Cloud Systems Project 
(EUROCS; Siebesma et al., 2004) where weather and cli-
mate prediction models are analyzed along a Pacific Ocean 
cross section, from the stratocumulus regions off Califor-
nia, across the shallow convection trade-wind areas, to the 
deep convection regions of the Intertropical Convergence 
Zone. This approach provides a simple framework for 3-di-
mensional model evaluation that includes several important 
cloud regimes such as stratocumulus and shallow and deep 
cumulus, as well as the transitions between them. The fact 
that data are needed only along a cross section provides a 
technically easier intercomparison. 


Over 20 weather and climate prediction organizations partic-
ipated during the first phase of GCPI and submitted model 
output, including: the National Center for Atmospheric Re-
search (NCAR), the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration /Goddard Institute for Space Studies, the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Geophysi-
cal Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, the National Centers for 
Environmental Prediction, the European Centre for Me-
dium-range Weather Forecasts, the United Kingdom Me-
teorological Office (UKMO), MeteoFrance, the Japanese 
Meteorological Agency, and the Max Planck Institute for 
Meteorology. Instantaneous model output was collected ev-
ery 3 hours for the periods of June–August 1998 and 2003, 
which allowed for detailed studies on the temporal variabil-
ity of cloud properties. 


The first results and model evaluation were presented at a 
joint GPCI and GCSS Boundary Layer Cloud Working 


Group workshop in September 2006. A comparison of 
monthly mean properties between models and observations 
showed that although most models often suffer from similar 
problems (e.g., negative stratocumulus cloud bias and posi-
tive shallow cumulus cloud bias) they also have quite dif-
ferent characteristics (e.g., the depth of the boundary layer 
evolving from a low to a high sea surface temperature region 
can be substantially different from model to model).


Also, histograms of cloud cover along the cross section dif-
fered from model to model. The figure at the top of page 1 
shows that some climate models (e.g., UKMO/HadGAM) 
exhibit a quasi-bimodal structure with cloud cover being 
either close to 100 percent or close to zero, while other cli-
mate models (e.g., NCAR/CAM3) show a more continuous 
transition. The GEWEX International Satellite Cloud Cli-
matology Project (ISCCP) observations showed results that 
are somewhere between these two extreme behaviors. These 
patterns reflect the different nature of the cloud, convection 
and boundary layer parameterizations, with some models 
basing their parameterizations on the idea of distinct regimes 
(with the consequent sharp transitions between them) while 
others base their parameterizations in climatological values. 


GPCI is now entering Phase II, where the models are to be 
confronted along the GPCI transection with cloud obser-
vations derived from new satellite products. Model results 
have been submitted for June–July–August 2003 and are be-
ing evaluated with a number of satellite products including 
the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS)-derived tempera-
ture and humidity data, and cloud-top heights derived from 
the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer. 


The combination of infrared and microwave radiances us-
ing AIRS and the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit and

GEWEX and WGNE Join Forces 
on Parameterization

University, Victoria, Australia; 2Chair, Working Group on 
Numerical Experimentation, European Centre for Medium-
range Weather Forecasts, Berkshire, United Kingdom


For many years the GEWEX Modelling and Prediction 
Panel (GMPP) and the Working Group on Numerical Ex-
perimentation (WGNE) have successfully collaborated on 
the development and evaluation of the representation of 
subgrid scale processes in terms of larger-scale parameters, 
(i.e., parameterization for atmospheric and land-surface 
models). A recent initiative, described below, has strength-
ened this collaboration further by bringing the two groups 
even closer together and aligning their activities.


Background
GEWEX has a long tradition in research, observations, 
and modelling of the global water and energy cycles, where 
parameterization science features strongly. Most of the 
GEWEX parameterization development activities are facili-
tated in the groups of GMPP, namely the GEWEX Cloud 
System Study (GCSS), the GEWEX Land/Atmosphere 
System Study (GLASS), and the GEWEX Atmospheric 
Boundary Layer Study (GABLS). Over the past decade or 
so, these groups have changed the research landscape in 
their respective areas by developing unique approaches to 
parameterizations and the means by which they are evalu-
ated, which are now widely adopted in the community. 
Despite these successes, some of which have gone relatively 
unnoticed, a feeling has emerged that interest and activities 
in the development of parameterizations for atmospheric 
models is somehow in decline. 


Many of the processes that are important to weather and  
climate act on scales smaller than the grid-sizes of contempo-
rary models used in numerical weather prediction (NWP), 
seasonal prediction and climate simulation. Examples of 
such processes are turbulence and convection in both the 
atmosphere and the ocean, cloud processes, and processes 
related to the energy, water and biogeochemical exchanges 
at land and ocean surfaces. As these processes affect the evo-
lution of the Earth System on all time-scales, they need to be 
represented in models—this is usually achieved by means of 
parameterization. It is generally accepted that the key defi-
ciencies, and hence uncertainties, in our current climate pro-
jections are directly related to our ability to represent these 
parametrized processes. Modern parameterizations are com-
prised of conceptual models of the processes they are aiming 
to represent. Importantly, this extends their usefulness well 
beyond the application in a model, as the conceptualization 
of a process requires a deep understanding of the important 
mechanisms and feedbacks. It can be argued that in many 
areas the need for improved parameterizations has driven 
research progress such as in the design and implementation 
of both field experiments and research satellites.

Experimentation (WGNE), Montreal, Canada, 3-7 November 2008.


resolution temperature and humidity profiles for infrared 
cloud fraction (the product of emissivity and coverage) up 
to about 70 percent. The AIRS retrievals have a nominal 
45 km horizontal spacing. Standard retrieved products in-
clude surface temperature, infrared cloud fraction, cloud 
top temperatures and pressures, and profiles of temperature 
and water vapor. The vertical resolution of the AIRS system 
is specified as 1 km for temperature and 2 km for water va-
por in the troposphere. The actual resolution may be better, 
and some results suggest sensitivity to sub-kilometer tem-
perature structure under certain conditions. AIRS achieves 
accuracies of 1 degree Kelvin per kilometer in temperature 
and 10 percent per 2 km in relative humidity.


The figure on page 4 shows two relative humidity cross sec-
tions along the GPCI transection from AIRS and the NCAR 
climate model for June–July–August 2003. It is clear that 
compared to AIRS the NCAR model produces a boundary 
layer that is unrealistically shallow. This is a result that has 
been confirmed by other sources. Major differences above 
the boundary layer may also be due to sampling issues re-
lated to the AIRS data. 


Finally, in order to incorporate Cloudsat and Cloud-Aero-
sol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations 
(CALIPSO) cloud data, it is planned to extract data from 
these instruments for the June-July-August period of 2008 
along the transection, together with GPCI Phase II model 
simulations.


All GPCI model data are available at the Data Integration 
Model Evalulation (DIME) web site (http://gcss-dime.giss.
nasa.gov/gpci/modsim_gpci.html), where users may intercom-
pare individual models with observations. GPCI is partially 
supported by the NASA Modelling, Analysis, and Predic-
tion (MAP) Program.

Recent decades have seen great advances in both comput-
ing and model design, leading to the application of mod-
els with smaller and smaller grid-sizes, particularly in the 
NWP area. Limited-area NWP models are now routinely 
used at grid-sizes well below 10 kilometers. These grid-
sizes begin to approach scales where certain processes that 
have traditionally been parametrized can be resolved by 
the model. Perhaps the prime example for such a process 
is that of atmospheric deep convection. This development 
has led to the erroneous impression in some quarters that 
parameterizations, in particular those of deep convection, 
do not require much further development as they will be-
come obsolete in the foreseeable future. 


While it is likely that a small number of research activi-
ties will employ global models of high enough resolu-
tion to be able to abandon the parameterization of deep 
convection, it is highly unlikely that even the most ad-
vanced prediction centers will be routinely using models 
of such resolution for several decades to come. This is 
particularly true for efforts in medium- and extended-
range prediction as well as climate prediction and simu-
lation, where the requirements of ensemble methods will 
prohibit the use of such high-resolution models. Even 
where these can be used, the parameterization of pro-
cesses other than deep convection will remain of crucial 
importance to climate research.


In contrast to the great advances in computing and general 
model development, the scientific field of parameteriza-
tion development has not advanced correspondingly, least 
of all for key moist processes such as clouds and convec-
tion. There are a number of likely reasons for this. Param-
eterization research requires a team effort where all aspects 
of development are covered in a holistic manner. It needs 
to be embedded in a global or limited area modelling ef-
fort to ensure that the work is relevant and practicable in 
the context of the overall model development. This makes 
it difficult to establish sustainable efforts away from large 
modelling centers and, with only a few notable exceptions, 
many centers have reduced their relative efforts in param-
eterization in recent years. 


It is likely that the perceived weaknesses in progress also 
comes from a lack of visibility and promotion of param-
eterization research through relevant international organiza-
tions. In the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), 
parameterization development activities have a relatively 
low profile and are mostly concentrated in GMPP, which in 
itself is a modest component of one of several large WCRP 
projects. The research efforts of the World Meteorological 
Organization (WMO) on weather prediction, which are co-
ordinated by the Comission for Atmospheric Science (CAS), 
have had relatively few specific parameterization efforts. It 
has been through the strong collaboration of GMPP with 
WGNE that parameterization development was connected 
to the main NWP and global models. Given the current 
and future importance of parameterization to ALL applica-
tions used in the many WCRP and CAS programmes, it is 


notable how little visibility and support has been given to 
parameterization development. 


New Plan for Parameterization Activities
Given the arguments outlined above, it is suggested that it 
is time to rethink the organization of parameterization de-
velopment in the various WMO activities, with the specific 
aims of:


(1) re-establishing parameterization development as 
an important scientific discipline; 


(2) promoting throughout all WMO research program-
mes the need for additional investment in param-
eterization development; 


(3) facilitating the necessary dialogue between param-
etrization developers and model users in all areas 
of model application; 


(4) facilitating scientific activities, such as coordinated 
research programmes, workshops, and scientific 
conferences on parameterization; 


(5) embracing parameterization development as an 
important contribution to enhance our predictive 
capabilities on all space and time-scales; and 


(6) building a critical mass within the WMO structure 
to make significant progress in critical areas of par-
ameterization development over the next 10 years.


To achieve these ambitious aims, it was agreed that it would 
be best to form one central, highly visible parameterization 
expert group within WMO. As WGNE provides links to all 
modelling communities from weather to climate, the most 
natural place for the parameterization expert team is under 
its auspices. The parameterization group will engage with all 
projects and working groups and aims to become the focal 
point for parameterization development within WMO and 
the community it represents. As this new group adds substan-
tially to WGNE’s portfolio, a new WGNE co-chair with spe-
cific responsibility for the parameterization activities has been 
appointed. The membership of the expert group is drawn 
from existing groups within WCRP and CAS and the cur-
rent chairs of the GEWEX projects GMPP, GCSS, GLASS 
and GABLS. It is a stated aim of the group to investigate and 
encourage the inclusion of parameterization efforts beyond 
the atmosphere and land surface, such as the ocean and the 
cryosphere, to enable cross-fertilization of concepts.


While the reorganization of parameterization research in it-
self is unlikely to bring about the required reinvigoration of 
this important area of modelling, it can serve as a launch 
platform. It is our sincere hope that the wider research and 
applications community will embrace this effort and make 
optimal use of it by engaging with and supporting param-
eterization developers. This is crucial if the improved models 
called for by all user communities are to be developed.

RAMI4PILPS: 
Assessing Shortwave Radiation Fluxes in 


Land Surface Schemes

Centre, Institute for Environment and Sustainability, Ispra, Italy;

Remotely sensed information about crucial surface properties—
such as albedo, leaf area index and the fraction of photosyntheti-
cally active radiation—is now available operationally and can be 
used in assimilation mode by Land Surface Schemes (LSS) of 
climate and/or numerical weather prediction models. It is thus 
more pertinent than ever to assess the accuracy and consistency 
of the absorbed, reflected and transmitted shortwave radiation 
fluxes in LSS.


At the Pan-GEWEX Meeting in 2006, the GEWEX Global 
Land Atmosphere System Study (GLASS) endorsed the Ra-
diation Transfer Model Intercomparison reference solutions for 
the Project for Intercomparison of Land-surface Parameteriza-
tion Schemes (RAMI4PILPS) suite of experiments. The goal of 
RAMI4PILPS is to evaluate current radiative transfer formula-
tions, look-up table approaches, and parametric solutions that 
quantify the shortwave radiation transfer within and beneath 
vegetation canopies in a manner suitable for inclusion in LSS of 
climate simulation and weather prediction models. 


All RAMI4PILPS experiments focus exclusively on (solar) short-
wave radiation, specifically on its partitioning into reflected (R), 
absorbed (A) and transmitted (T) flux components in the visible 
and near-infrared spectral regions. RAMI4PILPS experiments 
do not involve quantities pertaining to longwave radiation, nor 
do they involve forcing terms or temporal evolutions. Instead, 
these experiments are “instantaneous snapshots” of how direct 
or diffuse shortwave radiation (impinging at the top of a vegeta-
tion canopy) is partitioned into the aforementioned flux com-
ponents, such that the energy balance can be written as: A=1-R 
- (1-?)T, where ? is the soil albedo.


Within the RAMI4PILPS suite of experiments, two different 
sets of test cases are proposed: (1) structurally homogeneous 
environments that are reminiscent of grasslands and closed for-
est canopies, where participants are required to deliver all three 
radiative surface fluxes (R, A, and T) on the basis of detailed 
spectral and structural canopy descriptions; and (2) structurally 


heterogeneous environments that are reminiscent of shrublands 
and open forest canopies, where participants are provided with 
detailed canopy descriptions and the surface reflectance, R (often 
available in real application from remote sensing observations) 
and are requested to deliver their model’s estimate of the parti-
tioning of the remaining energy into A and T. 


In all cases the soil albedo, illumination conditions and foliage 
spectral properties are given, as are detailed structural properties 
of the various canopies. RAMI4PILPS will assess the quality of 
the submitted radiative fluxes by direct comparison with refer-
ence solutions obtained from Monte Carlo models that were 
evaluated during the various phases of the RAMI benchmarking 
exercise (Pinty et al., 2001, 2004; Widlowski et al., 2007). 


RAMI4PILPS directly benefits participants of PILPS by: (1) 
quantifying the typical errors associated with different modes of 
estimating the partitioning of shortwave radiative surface fluxes 
in LSS; (2) identifying the impact that structural and spectral 
sub-grid variability may have on these flux estimates; and (3) 
verifying the conservation of energy at the level of the surface.  
RAMI4PILPS can thus be envisaged as a quality control mecha-
nism to assess the appropriateness of radiative flux formulations 
in current and future LSS in light of assimilation efforts of remote 
sensing products into climate and weather prediction models.


Interested participants are asked to contact the RAMI4 
PILPS coordinator (rami.webadmin@jrc.it) and submit their 
flux estimates before 15 April 2009 using the procedure out-
lined on the RAMI4PILPS web site at http://rami-benchmark. 
jrc.ec.europa.eu/. For both sets of RAMI4PILPS test cases, the 
submission of simulation/look-up table results from stand-
alone radiation transfer models as well as modules that are part 
of larger simulation models are encouraged, be they Soil Veg-
etation Atmosphere Transfer, numerical weather prediction or 
regional/global circulation models.

Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment


More than 230 scientists participated in discussions on 
the future of observing and modelling clouds during the  
4th Pan-GEWEX Cloud Systems Studies (GCSS) Meeting 
held at MeteoFrance in Toulouse on 2–6 June 2008. The 
Pan-GCSS meetings are held every 3 years to promote inter-
action between its many working groups, discuss advances 
on relevant topics in the field of clouds and convection, and 
attract new scientists to its activities.


GCSS investigates cloud systems, their role in the climate sys-
tem, and their representation in models in order to improve 
prediction of weather and climate using state-of the-art mod-
elling and data assimilation systems. This research is presently 
conducted through four working groups that concentrate on 
different cloud systems: (1) boundary layer clouds, (2) cir-
rus clouds, (3) precipitating convective cloud systems, and 
(4) polar clouds. The strategy of these groups is to conduct 
process-oriented studies based on field experiments using 
high-resolution models such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES) 
models and Cloud Resolving Models (CRMs) as a virtual 
laboratory. Observational data, LES model and CRM output 
are analyzed and compared among different model codes and 
used to develop and evaluate parameterizations to be used in 
large-scale climate and numerical weather prediction (NWP) 
models. This parameterization evaluation is performed by 
Single Column Model (SCM) versions of General Circula-
tion Models (GCMs) that are challenged to reproduce simi-
lar cloud and turbulent transport properties as observed and 
simulated in virtual laboratories. The critical premise of this 
strategy is that the intermodel differences between the high 
resolution model (i.e., CRM and LES) output is substantially 
smaller than the intermodel differences of the parameterized 
processes in the SCMs. 


A new and overarching theme of GCSS is related to cloud 
microphysics, precipitation, and the influence of these pro-
cesses on the mean thermodynamic atmospheric state. Three 
examples of the present research are given below. 


The first example deals with warm maritime shallow clouds 
such as those observed during the Rain in Cumulus over 
the Ocean (RICO) experiment, which has quantified con-
vincingly that precipitation is a common feature for these 
clouds, a feature often neglected in large-scale models. The 
tenth intercomparison case for LES models and SCMs 
of the Working Group of Boundary Layer Clouds showed 
that precipitation limits the growth of these cumulus clouds 
and hence the depth of the boundary layer, while consecu-
tive sensitivity studies reveal that moister boundary lay-
ers lead to deeper clouds that rain more. The LES ensem-
ble mean value of the surface rain rate is 21 Wm-2, which

Netherlands


is in close agreement with the SPOL-radar estimates of  
18 Wm-2. The individual LES model results, however, exhibit 
a wide spread ranging from 0 to 25 Wm-2. More worrying 
is the observation that the LES models with sophisticated 
binned microphysics schemes do not provide more accurate 
precipitation rates than the ones with simpler two-moment 
bulk microphysical schemes for these warm clouds. SCMs 
show an equivalent large range of uncertainty in precipita-
tion. Many of these uncertainties can be attributed to un-
certainties in the assumed probability distribution functions 
of the raindrop sizes and the evaporation rates of rain; more 
details can be found at http://www.knmi.nl/samenw/rico.


The second example is based on mixed-phase stratocumulus 
clouds such as those observed during the U.S. Department of 
Energy’s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Pro-
gram’s Mixed-Phase Arctic Cloud Experiment (MPACE) at  
the Alaskan coast near Barrow. The upper half of the well-mixed 
boundary layer contained a mixed-phase cloud with a cloud 
top temperature of -15°C. The observed liquid water path was  
160 g m-2 and the ice water path, computed as the mass of 
ice between the surface and cloud top, was 15 g m-2. A model 
intercomparison study of SCMs, CRMs and LES models has 
been organized jointly by the GCSS Polar Clouds Working 
Group and the ARM Program (Klein et al., 2008). This study 
shows that, on average, all three classes of models strongly 
underestimate the amount of supercooled water by a factor of 
three (see figure on next page). This underestimation is most 
prominent for models using a single moment microphys-
ics scheme in which the split-up between ice and water is a 
simple diagnostic function based on temperature only. The 
bias is reduced for more sophisticated two-moment bulk mi-
crophysics schemes. However, further reduction through the 
use of even more sophisticated explicit binned microphysics 
did not improve on the underestimation tendency, which is 
in line with findings for the warm clouds of RICO. Sensitiv-
ity studies show that the underestimation of the supercooled 
liquid water is predominantly due to the conversion rates of 
liquid water to ice.


The third and last example concerns cirrus ice clouds based 
on observations from 9 March 2000 at the Oklahoma ARM 
Southern Great Plains site; these observations form the basis 
of a model intercomparison study organized by the Cirrus 
Working Group. The main focus of this study is on evalua-
tion of these ice clouds for ice water path (IWP), ice number 
concentration (ICN) and ice particle fall speeds. While there 
is fair agreement between observations and the CRM results 
for IWP and ICN, all models seem to underestimate the ice 
particle fall velocity. Moreover, SCMs tend to overestimate 
ice amount and underestimate the decay of ice water content 
with time. The errors point toward problems with the vertical 
velocity, the influence of subgrid variability, and the specifica-
tion of ice particle fall velocity in present day parameteriza-
tions for ice clouds. 


These three examples demonstrate that cloud microphysics is 
one of the larger uncertainties for all cloud types (warm, ice and 
mixed-phase) and that further dedicated research is needed.

To respond to this urgent need, a new cloud microphysics 
working group was established, chaired by Ulrike Lohmann, 
with a kick-off meeting held during the Pan-GCSS meeting. 
Two different approaches are currently being put forward. One 
approach is to conduct idealized simulations for the CRM 
(and where possible for the SCM) community. Ben Shipway 
of the UK Met Office has proposed three idealized cases: (1) 
one warm rain maritime cumulus case based on RICO; (2) 
a deep convective case from the Kwajalein Experiment; and 
(3) one mixed-phase case from MPACE (Klein et al., 2008). 
In order to separate uncertainties caused by dynamics from 
uncertainties caused by the microphysical formulation itself, 
dynamics are partially prescribed through simple transient 
updraughts that advect moisture and hydrometeors, keep-
ing the temperature fixed (including negation of latent heat 
release) and allowing only positive increments to the initial  
vapor field. This way uncertainties due to different formula-
tions in the microphysics can be more easily quantified. 


The second approach uses long-term SCM intercomparisons 
at the atmospheric profiling site Cabauw (The Netherlands) 
using the CloudNet classification scheme. Participating 
SCMs are nudged with European Centre for Medium-range 
Weather Forecasts reanalyses and the outputs are evaluated 
with CloudNet data, which provides information about 
cloud phase and the type of precipitation. This approach can 
be used for the validation of freezing parameterizations and 
precipitation development in SCM/GCM and NWP. If suc-
cessful, it can be extended to ARM sites and others. 


Although parameterization evaluations of large-scale models 
using SCMs based on individual cases—such as is done rou-
tinely in the four working groups—are a necessary step in pa-
rameterization development, it is not necessarily sufficient to 
evaluate new parameterization schemes in a broader 3-dimen-
sional (3-D) context. Therefore, the GEWEX Pacific Cross 
Section Intercomparison (GPCI) Working Group is evaluat-
ing cloud properties of 3-D climate and numerical weather 
predictions along a transection over the Pacific Ocean encom-
passing regions of persistent stratocumulus, shallow cumuli,

to strongly underpredict the liquid water path for these arctic mixed-
phase clouds (taken from Klein et al.).


and deep convective tropical clouds, the three prevalent cloud 
types over the marine subtropics. For recent developments 
and background, please see the article on the cover page of 
this newsletter.


A new focal point of GCSS deals with cloud climate feed-
back. The Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project 
(CFMIP) was launched in 2003 to encourage coordinated 
research in the area of cloud feedback in climate models.  
CFMIP has been successful in quantifying the uncertainties 
in cloud climate feedback and has identified low clouds as be-
ing highly influential. The project is now entering its second 
phase, during which a prime question is, Which modelling 
assumptions in the parameterizations of clouds, boundary 
layer, and convective processes affect their response to climate 
change? To this purpose, a collaboration between CFMIP 
and GCSS has been initiated and practical working plans 
were discussed during breakout sessions at the Pan-GCSS 
Meeting. For more details on the future plans of the GCSS/
CFMIP collaboration, see page 10 in this newsletter. 


A special theme at the meeting was high-resolution model-
ling on large domains. Ever increasing computer resources 
allow us to resolve spatial scales over more than three orders 
of magnitude on time scales of several days to weeks. Marat 
Kharoutdinov, of Stony Brook University, showed the poten-
tial of LES modelling of tropical deep convection on large 
domains of 200 km at a resolution of 100 meters based on 
observations from the Global Atmospheric Research Program 
(GARP) Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE). It is encour-
aging to see that realistic mesoscale structures such as precip-
itation-induced cold pools do show up in such simulations, 
provided that LES is conducted on large enough domains 
(see figure below). This opens the opportunity to use LES 
modelling as a virtual laboratory for deep convection in a way

that is similar to its application to smaller scale boundary layer 
clouds during the last decade. 


Another interesting development is the use of CRMs as op-
erational high resolution numerical weather prediction mod-
els. Axel Seifert (Deutscher Wetterdienst) showed results of 
the German convective-scale short range model Consortium 
for Small-scale Modelling, Germany (COSMO-DE) that is 
operationally running with a resolution of 2.8 km. This devel-
opment addresses new parameterization issues, such as how 
to parameterize cloud-related processes at resolutions of 1–5 
km. This is a difficult resolution (a “physics no man’s land”) 
at which convective cloud processes are partially resolved but 
it is not clear whether standard parameterization approaches 
and quasi-equilibrium assumptions are applicable. The inter-
action between parameterized boundary layer processes and 
the resolved convection appears to be crucial. 


A final new development is the use of Global Cloud Resolv-
ing Models, such as the Japanese Nonhydrostatic Icosahedral 
Atmospheric Model that operates at a resolution of 3.5 km, 
albeit for short periods only (Miura et al., 2007). Despite 
the fact that dependency of the resolved convection on un-
resolved processes exists, these model results offer an unprec-
edented and interesting model database to analyze interac-
tions between large-scale atmospheric circulation and tropical 
convection in a global context.


Finally, in order to strengthen the interaction between the 
GCSS modelling community and the observational commu-
nity, there was a special session on: results of recent field cam-
paigns such as the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analy-
sis Project (AMMA), the Climate Observation and Prediction 
Strategy, and the Tropical Warm Pool International Cloud 
Experiment (TWP-ICE); cloud climatologies of new satellite 
products such as those derived from Cloudsat and the Cloud-
Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations; 
and new products from atmospheric profiling stations such as 
ARM and CLOUDNET. As a result, new GCSS cases based 
on TWP-ICE and AMMA are being designed by the GCSS 
Working Group on Precipitating Convective Systems, and 
satellite products from the A-Train satellite constellation will 
be used for model evaluation on GPCI. 


It was encouraging to see such a fruitful collaboration among 
model developers, the cloud observational community and 
the climate model evaluation community. The challenge 
of GCSS for the coming years will be to keep the dialogue 
among these three communities alive. All the meeting presen-
tations can be downloaded at http://knmi.nl/~siebesma/PAN-

Background
The Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reaffirms the spread in 
equilibrium climate sensitivity and in transient climate re-
sponse among current climate models. Intermodel differ-
ences in cloud feedbacks remain the primary source of this 
spread (Randall et al., 2007; Dufresne and Bony, 2008). It 
should be emphasized, however, that uncertainties in cloud 
processes and feedbacks are not the sole problem of climate 
sensitivity estimates. 


Clouds play a critical role in anthropogenic aerosol-induced 
climate forcing. In addition to modulating the Earth’s radia-
tion balance, clouds also play a key role in the hydrological 
cycle and in the large-scale atmospheric circulation, at both 
planetary and regional scales. By affecting precipitation and 
atmospheric dynamics, uncertainties in cloud and moist 
processes are a concern for virtually all aspects of climate 
modelling and climate change research. In a context where 
the climate modelling community is increasingly focusing its 
efforts on the assessment of regional climate change impacts 
and biochemical (e.g., carbon and aerosols) climate feed-
backs, improving our understanding of cloud-climate inter-
actions and the representation of cloud and moist processes 
in climate models remains imperative. It is in fact an urgent 
need if we are to gain confidence in simulations of future 
climate changes, both at the global and regional scales.


The difficulty that general circulation models (GCMs) have 
in predicting clouds, which was first emphasized 30 years 
ago by A. Arakawa and J. Charney, has been an unresolved 
problem for the modelling community. Fortunately there 
are now new resources available to observe clouds, such as 
the A-Train constellation of satellites, the long time-series 
of ground-based observations from instrumented sites, and 
many observational campaigns. On the modelling side, 
cloud-resolving models (CRMs) and large-eddy simula-
tion models (LES) now run on increasingly large space 
and time scales, and a new generation of climate models is 
emerging that uses CRM physics in place of conventional 
parameterizations and performs global simulations of the 
Earth’s atmosphere. In such a context, two questions arise: 
(1) Why has progress been so slow in the representation 
and understanding of cloud-climate interactions? and (2) 
How can we ensure that these new resources will actually 
lead to progress?

CFMIP Phase 2
Part of the problem is that bridges have been missing between 
different research communities involved in cloud studies. To 
remedy this problem, Phase 2 of the Cloud Feedback Model 
Intercomparison Project (CFMIP-2), in close collaboration 
with the GEWEX Cloud System Study (GCSS), is currently 
engaged in the construction of three such bridges.


Bridge 1: CFMIP Observation Simulator Package (COSP)
COSP is a community software tool, which was developed at 
several research centers (the Hadley Centre of the Met Office, 
LMD Institut Pierre Simon Laplace, Colorado State Univer-
sity and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) and 
allows us to diagnose from climate model outputs some quan-
tities (e.g., brightness temperatures at specific wavelengths,  
radar reflectivities and lidar scattering ratios) that can 
be directly and consistently compared to satellite re-
trievals, while taking into account issues related to the 
viewing geometry, the cloud vertical overlap, the sen-
sitivity of instruments and the attenuation of the re-
mote signals (Klein and Jakob, 1999; Webb et al., 2001; 
Chepfer et al., 2008; Bodas-Salcedo et al., 2008). COSP  
includes modules capable of simulating the International 
Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), CloudSat 
and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite 
Observations (CALIPSO) data, and will be widely distrib-
uted to modelling groups (http://www.cfmip.net). 


Bridge 2: Process-Oriented Diagnostics
The evaluation of general circulation model simulations—not 
only at the large-scale level and on long time-scales but also at 
the process level—will contribute to a better understanding 
of the physical processes involved in the large-scale behavior 
of clouds and their dependence on model parameterizations, 
and help to better assess the credibility of these simulations 


by comparison with LES/CRM models and in-situ observa-
tions from instrumented sites or field campaigns.


Bridge 3: Idealized Simulations
One condition to narrow the widening gap between sim-
ulation and understanding in climate modelling (Held, 
2005) is to better understand the reasons why complex 
climate models behave the way they do and why they 
differ from one another. Examining moist processes and 
cloud-climate feedbacks in a suite of simplified or idealized 
contexts, such as in aqua-planet experiments (Medeiros et 
al., 2008) or through uni-dimensional cloud feedback ex-
periments that aim to mimic the behavior of specific cloud 
types predicted by GCMs under climate change (Zhang 
and Bretherton, 2008), will help to determine and priori-
tize the most critical processes. Such guidance is critical 
if we are to design observational and modelling strategies 
to improve our confidence in climate model predictions. 
These experiments will also help to build a bridge between 
global climate modelling, very fine-scale modelling and 
conceptual or theoretical representations of the climate 
system. The benefits associated with each approach may 
complement each other in a constructive way.


Recommendations for Advancing Cloud-Climate  
  Feedback Assessments
To foster the above activities, the CFMIP and GCSS com-
munities, with the endorsement of the GEWEX Scientific 
Steering Group and the World Meteorological Organi-
zation (WMO) Commission for Atmospheric Sciences 
(CAS) Working Group on Numerical Experimentation 
(WGNE), have prepared a set of recommendations for ad-
vancing the assessment of cloud-climate feedbacks. Those 
recommendations were discussed at the last meeting of the 
WCRP Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM) 


To better evaluate and improve the representa-
tion of cloud and moist processes by climate 
models and to better understand cloud-climate 
feedbacks, CFMIP2 (in close collaboration with 
GCSS) is engaged in three main activities:


(1) the development of an observation sim-
ulator package to evaluate models’ clouds 
using satellite observations; 


(2) process diagnostics to better evaluate 
and understand the processes responsible 
for the large-scale behavior of clouds in 
general circulation models; and 


(3) idealized simulations to better under-
stand the cloud-climate feedbacks pro-
duced by climate models.

held in Paris, France, in September 2008, which led the 
WGCM to recommend that:


(1) COSP be used in a subset of the main numeri-
cal experiments that will be coordinated by the 
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) 
in support of the next IPCC assessment report; 


(2) a few idealized experiments be included in the set 
of the next climate model intercomparison project 
(CMIP5) experiments; and 


(3) additional cloud diagnostics proposed by CFMIP-
GCSS be extracted from the models participating 
in CMIP5. 


A broad scientific community interested in cloud stud-
ies, both on the modelling and observation sides, is keen 
to participate in this effort and contribute to advances 
in cloud-climate feedback assessments by the time of the 
Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC. By that time and 
beyond, these initiatives will also benefit from and sup-
port GEWEX-WGNE joint efforts on the improvement of 
physical parameterizations in climate models.

Meeting/Workshop Reports


WATCH/LoCo Workshop 


25–27 June 2008
De Bilt, The Netherlands

Hydrology (CEH) Wallingford, Oxfordshire, UK


The joint workshop of the European Union Water and Global 
Change (WATCH) Project and GEWEX Local Coupled Proj-
ect (LoCo) Workshop brought together experts on hydrologi-
cal land-atmosphere coupling to assess current knowledge of 
land-atmosphere coupling and develop plans for future stud-
ies. Research in modelling and observing the degree of land-
atmosphere coupling and feedbacks on local and regional scales 
has been evolving since the start of the well-known GEWEX 
Global Land Atmospheric Coupling Experiment (GLACE). 
WATCH addresses hydrological land-atmosphere coupling, 
and LoCo under the GEWEX Global Land Atmosphere Sys-
tem Study is studying local land-atmosphere coupling to iden-
tify conditions or areas where land-atmosphere interaction has 
a significant impact on the local climate. LoCo also designs 
model intercomparison studies. Results from the workshop in-
cluded a better definition of local coupling and an outline of an 
overview scientific paper on the topic. 


A good conceptual definition of local land-atmosphere cou-
pling involves the temporal and spatial scale of all land surface-
related processes directly influencing the state of the Planetary 
Boundary Layer (PBL) (see figure on page 13). These processes 
include:


(1) direct moistening/drying and heating/cooling of the 
PBL, and the feedback exerted by this PBL change on 
the surface fluxes;


(2) impact of the change of the PBL depth or thermodynam-
ic state on the formation/disappearance of PBL clouds 
(shallow cumulus) induced by land surface fluxes;


(3) triggering and fuelling of shallow or deep convection; 
and 


(4) accumulation of hydrological anomalies in the soil wa-
ter or snow reservoir, as well as the subsequent impacts 
of these surface states on the surface energy balance.


It was also recognized that many expressions of land-atmo-
sphere coupling are not easily tied to the local scale, such as 
precipitation response to changing soil moisture in GLACE. 
Large-scale atmospheric circulation—under certain condi-
tions—is also clearly affected by the state of the land surface. 
These examples are considered to be beyond the immediate 
scope of the LoCo theme. Each of the processes listed above is 
briefly discussed below, guided by the presentations and discus-
sions that emerged during the workshop. 


Direct Land-PBL Feedback
While evaporation clearly moistens the atmosphere, it does

(partly) rely on the atmospheric demand for water, depending 
on the moisture condition: a straightforward feedback loop is 
evident. However, the state of the (well-mixed dry) PBL is not 
only dependent on the surface fluxes of heat and moisture but 
also on the overlying free atmosphere. Daytime PBL drying oc-
curs due to a mixing-in of dry air, in spite of an upward surface 
moisture flux. This feedback needs to be considered when trying 
to estimate surface evaporation from simple environmental vari-
ables, like available energy (A) or vapor pressure deficit (D). 


A number of diagnostics and concepts were discussed at the 
workshop. Jim Shuttleworth used the definitions of “climato-
logical resistance” (defining the ratio between A and D) and the 
“area average surface resistance” to give a theoretical explanation 
for differences in trends between open water and actual evapora-
tion rates, depending on the aridity of the climate. Compared to 
earlier concepts of the Priestly-Tailor coefficient or McNaugh-
ton’s coupling coefficient, the role of PBL feedback in the char-
acterization of the surface state is clear. 


Likewise, Joe Santanello expanded on ear-
lier work by Alan Betts by decomposing 
the diurnal evolution of the surface tem-
perature and humidity into a surface driven 
and entrainment driven component. Pilot 
studies with the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration’s (NASA) Land In-
formation System (LIS) were carried out to 
identify the impact of switching between a 
suite of land surface or PBL models. The 
diagnostic is also built into the Single Col-
umn Model (SCM) testbed environment 
developed by Roel Neggers, which is used 
more and more in GEWEX Cloud System 
Study (GCSS) and GEWEX Atmospheric 
Boundary Layer Study (GABLS) model 
intercomparison studies. 


Cumulus Formation
Michael Ek cast the relative contribution of land wetness versus 
atmospheric entrainment nicely in an expression of the PBL 
relative humidity tendency. He performed SCM studies for a 
few special cases where PBL cloud formation appeared to be 
highly sensitive to both surface evaporation and atmospheric 
stability above the PBL. However, cloud formation (and its im-
pact on surface radiation and conditional stability) is not well 
embedded in the diagnostics above, so more attention should 
be focused on these feedbacks in future diagnostic studies. 


Triggering and Fuelling Convection 
Although she was not present at the workshop, the work of 
Kirsten Findell proved a valuable component of the LoCo 
theme, particularly those pieces dealing with the creation of area 
maps and conditions where soil moisture values affect the for-
mation of convection (Findell and Eltahir, 2003). SCM models 
were forced with observed atmospheric profiles that were used 
to identify when and where different soil moisture states were 
able to determine whether or not convection was triggered. Al-
though in many cases convective triggering is not determined by 
the local soil moisture state, cases can be found where convec-
tion is preferably triggered over either moist or dry soils. Craig 


Ferguson expanded on this concept by calculating the Convec-
tive Triggering Potential (CTP) and the atmospheric dewpoint 
depression from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder satellite data 
as a first promising step to creating land-atmosphere feedback 
maps from spaceborne observations. In addition, he explored 
the correlations between soil moisture and Lifting Condensa-
tion Level (LCL) using Advanced Microwave Scanning Radi-
ometer - Earth Observing System data. 


On a somewhat smaller scale, Chris Taylor studied the formation 
and dynamics of Mesoscale Convection Systems in the Sahel 
region, depending on the spatially varying surface temperature 
pattern induced by earlier rain storms. He argues that convec-
tive triggering often takes place at the interface between wet and 
dry soil patches, where both a sufficient surface heating and fur-
ther fuelling of the convective system with moisture occur. His 
work clearly points at the need to consider spatial variability as a 
contributor to convective activity and land-atmosphere feedback 
within the scope of LoCo.


Accumulation of Anomalies
The (hydrological) land state has a long 
memory; many observational and mod-
elling studies have shown the importance 
of hydrological anomalies in the past to 
explain extreme conditions in the pres-
ent. Local land-atmosphere interaction 
may turn into long-lasting positive feed-
back loops when critical thresholds are 
exceeded. Sonia Seneviratne used a plot 
of monthly mean surface evaporation 
/sensible heat versus a soil moisture in-
dex to demonstrate a clear difference in 
memory (causing hysteresis in the plot) 
for a Northern and Southern European 
Fluxnet site. This type of analysis can be 
used to evaluate the realism of land-at-


mosphere coupling representation in current climate models.


One of the ultimate goals of the LoCo community is to pro-
duce comprehensive global distributions of where and when 
the land surface and the atmosphere have a strong mutual feed-
back, either positive or negative. The importance of this work 
is demonstrated by Stefan Hagemann, who reviews the various 
pathways of land-atmosphere coupling and their representa-
tion in global climate models (GCMs) used for present-day 
and future climate calculations. Bernie Bisselink’s precipitation 
recycling analysis made clear that on relatively short mutual 
distances within Europe, strong recycling is favored under very 
different climatological conditions. Since multiple diagnostics 
and processes are involved, multiple maps already exist. Randy 
Koster provided observational support of the earlier defined 
hotspots of land atmosphere coupling by pinpointing areas 
where the correlation between temperature and precipitation 
identifies regions where evaporation is both highly variable (by 
a variation in the degree to which it is controlled by radiation 
or soil water content) and highly coherent (expressing a strong 
surface control on the evaporation). Such hotspot regions are 
highly dynamic and are expected to be geographically shift-
ed with climate change, as highlighted by Sonia Seneviratne.  
Richard de Jeu used satellite imagery of surface soil moisture to

plot the global distribution of typical time scales of changes in 
soil moisture, another way to express the potential soil control 
on evaporation variability. Together with the remote sensing 
based maps of Craig Ferguson, a suite of coupling products will 
become available that highlights different aspects of the cou-
pling: the PBL feedback (Betts’ soil moisture LCL diagram), 
convective triggering, soil memory (satellite soil moisture), and 
pathways possibly including large-scale processes (Koster’s cou-
pling coefficient).


A global map with coupling strength diagnostics needs to in-
corporate these various coupling mechanisms. As a start, we 
propose to apply a hierarchy approach where the coupling 
pathway may be associated with an index, which is subsequent-
ly plotted. The first level of coupling is the direct PBL feed- 
back, which may be expressed as the degree to which evapo-
ration is sensitive to soil moisture. A positive feedback may 
emerge when low evaporation/high sensible heat flux may en-
hance PBL growth that leads to further drying and a higher 
Bowen ratio. A second level would cover the formation of PBL 
clouds and its radiative consequences. A positive feedback here 
might be a case where clouds develop at high moisture con-
tents, reducing surface radiation, surface heating, and PBL 
growth and allowing for a further build-up of PBL humidity. 
The third level is the triggering of convection, which may show 
positive or negative feedback via the likelihood of generating 
precipitation that moistens the soil, as detailed by Findell and 
Taylor. Finally, level four expresses an overall hydrological feed-
back signature that is produced by the impact of land surface 
on precipitation, i.e., diagnosed from the coupling coefficient 
detailed by Koster.


What would such a map look like? Starting from the first level 
coupling, areas will be highlighted where changes in soil mois-
ture do have a pronounced effect on the daytime PBL. For in-
stance, the ratio between the surface and entrainment Bowen 
ratio diagnosed from Santanello’s framework changes signifi-
cantly for small soil moisture perturbations. Where this is not 
the case, a strong impact of land surface on the atmospheric 
state cannot be expected, and further analysis is not necessary. 
For areas where index 1 is significant, the second and third feed-
back via cloud formation or convective triggering can be tested. 
Likewise, a small soil moisture perturbation leads to cloud for-
mation which is either shallow without rain (index 2) or deeper 
with possible rainfall (index 3). The formation of rainfall will 
at the end be labeled as index 4. If somewhere in the chain this 
feedback appears weak or even negative, a strong impact of (lo-
cal) land state on (local) precipitation is not expected.


This framework is still maturing; a proof of concept will be ex-
amined using the NASA LIS coupled to the Weather Research 
Foundation atmospheric model featuring a suite of land, PBL 
and convection parameterization schemes. For a number of 
different climate regimes, a set of snapshot experiments will be 
set up and perturbation experiments applied to determine the 
hierarchy of coupling indices. If this setup is successful, we will  
extend it to the multi-year global scale. For more information,

10th BSRN Scientific Review and Workshop 
De Bilt, The Netherlands


7–11 July 2008

1National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Boulder, 
CO, USA; 2International GEWEX Project Office, Silver Spring, 
MD, USA


More than 50 scientific talks and 20 posters were given at the 
tenth biennial Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) 
Scientific Review and Workshop, held at the Royal Nether-
lands Meteorological Institute (KNMI). Over 60 BSRN sta-
tion managers, data users and experts in the field of surface 
radiation measurements attended. 


Dr. Reinout Boers, KNMI, gave the first presentation, an 
overview of the observations and research activities at the 
Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research (CE-
SAR). In addition to its monitoring activities for BSRN, 
CESAR participates in other projects such as the GEWEX 
Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project 
and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Glob-
al Atmosphere Watch Programme.


Gert König-Langlo of the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), 
reported on the progress of the relocation of the World Ra-
diation Monitoring Center (WMRC), housing the BSRN 
data archive, from the Federal Institute of Technology Zur-
ich to the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in Bremerhaven, 
Germany. In June 2008, full responsibility for the operation 
of WRMC was transferred to AWI. Currently, the archive 
holds 4,032 station-months from 43 stations. Data can be 
accessed at http://www.bsrn.awi.de.


Four new BSRN sites are now operational in Brazil (Rolim 
de Moura, Brasília, Petrolina, and São Martinho da Serra), 
along with the two existing sites in Florianopolis and Bal-
bina. The Florianopolis site is being moved to a new loca-
tion outside the city and there is a proposal to move Balbina 
(now in the Amazon) to a Large-scale Biosphere Atmosphere 
Experiment in Amazonia site because its current location is 
too remote and hard to maintain. The National Renewable 
Energy Centre in Pamplona, Spain, and Eureka station in 
Nunavut, Canada, were approved as new BSRN stations.


Richard Thigpen, Global Climate Observing System 
(GCOS) Secretariat, reported on WMO Activities aimed 
at improving the operation of GCOS networks, mainly 
the surface (GSN) and upper air (GUAN) networks. Sev-
eral upper air and surface stations have been renovated, and 
workshops focused on surface and upper air measurements 
have led to improved quality of observations. Four technical 
support projects have been established in developing areas 
to provide direct technical support to GCOS stations. Nine 
Commission for Basic Systems Lead Centers for GCOS 
have been established around the world to provide better 
coordination with operating stations. 


The BSRN Project Manager noted that activities beyond ba-

sic data collection have been constrained during the past 2 
years as a result of BSRN management focusing on the data 
archive transition, and also due to widespread tightening of 
budgets. Considerable work on other topics related to sur-
face radiation and associated interests continues both within 
and outside BSRN. While there has long been an empha-
sis on the open publication of results obtained within the 
BSRN project, this meeting saw a renewed request that all 
substantial undertakings related to the organization—and 
particularly its working groups—should lead to and result 
in such publication or results needed to ensure that the work 
receives appropriate credit and will be readily available for 
future generations who will pursue this work. 


It was noted that BSRN should consider providing a broad-
er range of data products through its archive in order to 
be more responsive to its user community, and to extend 
the utility of the information acquired as part of the effort. 
Future guidance will be provided to the BSRN archive as to 
which products might be most useful. 


Results were summarized from the International Workshop 
on Global Dimming and Brightening (GDB), held 10–14 
February 2008 in Ein Gedi, Israel. In particular, BSRN is 
well positioned to address GDB issues, and was recognized 
as a world leader in surface radiation measurement activities. 
There was general agreement at the conference that longer, 
better spatially distributed surface radiation measurement 
records are needed, especially over the oceans. In addition, 
agreement was reached that the GDB phenomenon is real 
and that the next step is to determine the causes.


The Surface Radiation Budget Project has produced a con-
tinuous record of shortwave/longwave radiation data (SRB 
V3.0) for the top of the atmosphere as well as the Earth's 
surface at a 1° longitude by 1° latitude resolution for the 
time span of 23 years, from July 1983 to June 2006. The data 
are given at 3-hourly, 3-hourly-monthly, daily, and monthly 
means. Since these data are derived from satellite-based ob-
servations, it is important to validate the data set against 
ground-based measurements such as those of BSRN. 


The culmination of several years’ work as reported in three 
defining publications has resulted in a proposed reference 
group of pyranometers for diffuse solar irradiance. This 
work has established the certain accuracy uncertainty in dif-
fuse solar irradiance observations, considering all the ma-
jor known sources of uncertainty are found to be within  
2–4 W/m2. The work provides a reference through which 
current and future diffuse solar irradiance observations can 
be evaluated, although the work provides more for a meth-
odology and set of evaluation criteria by which other in-
dependent approaches can be evaluated and related to the 
same level agreement.


Large uncertainties were still reported to exist in our knowl-
edge of the Earth radiation balance and its representation 
in climate models. Accordingly, global mean radiation bud-
gets simulated by climate models differ largely, particularly 


at the surface. BSRN data provide a unique opportunity to 
constrain these uncertainties. The data suggest that many 
models overestimate downward solar radiation and underes-
timate downward longwave radiation. 


BSRN data also allowed the detection of widespread sur-
face solar brightening since the early 1990s, after decades of 
dimming. Global climate model simulations performed at 
the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) with the 
ECHAM5-HAM model suggest that brightening will turn 
back into a dimming in the coming decades, and downward 
longwave radiation will increase at 2–3 Wm-2 per decade. It 
will therefore be exciting to see what BSRN data will show 
over coming years, and whether they will support or dis-
prove the model predictions.


Many additional focused papers were presented on the work 
of BSRN site scientists and other topics related to surface ra-
diation observation and quantification. The meeting provides 
an excellent forum for these papers, where many of those in 
attendance share similar interests and often conduct related 
investigations. All presentations were directly related to some 
aspect of quantitative surface radiation determination, as 
well as the use and evaluation of that information. While 
there were too many presentations to review here, the com-
plete agenda and most presentation materials are available on 
the BSRN website at http://www.gewex.org/bsrn.html. 


As of early 2008, BSRN has 3,941 site-months of data in the 
archive from 39 ground sites located on all continents; the 
earliest data go all the way back to 1992. The measurements 
are made at 1-minute, 2-minute, 3-minute or 5-minute in-
tervals. Considerable work is needed to process the BSRN 
data to make them comparable with the GEWEX SRB data. 
Additionally, the BSRN data files contain 11 quality flags 
for each data point. A procedure needs to be designed to ap-
propriately use the information in order to exclude possibly 
erroneous data.


The exceptional hospitality of the KNMI staff, particularly  
Dr. Wouter Knap, in hosting the meeting and arranging for 
the site tour of the Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmo-
spheric Research was greatly appreciated.

Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment


25th ISCCP Anniversary Symposium


23–25 July 2008 
New York, NY, USA


William B. Rossow
NOAA/CREST, City College of New York, NY, USA


In July 2008, the International Satellite Cloud Climatology 
Project (ISCCP), the first project of the World Climate Re-
search Programme, marked the 25th Anniversary of the begin-
ning of data collection. Not bad for a project that originally 
was to last for only 5 years! The original concept for ISCCP 
was to collect and distribute enough global satellite data to 
facilitate research on the role of clouds in climate, specifical-
ly their effects on the radiation budget and their role in the 
atmospheric water cycle. These data were to be sampled at 
sufficiently fine space-time intervals to capture the mesoscale-
to-global scale and diurnal-to-interannual variations of cloud 
physical properties.


In addition to calibrating, navigating, quality checking and 
distributing the satellite radiance data for the research com-
munity to use (one of the earliest projects to invest in more 
“user-friendly” Level 1 data), ISCCP conducted a comparison 
of the then-existing cloud algorithms and then processed the 
radiance data to provide several different cloud data products 
for research. After more research and evaluation results accu-
mulated, the ISCCP analysis was revised, particularly to in-
clude a treatment for ice clouds. The ISCCP product line has 
continued to expand, now including radiative flux profiles, 
cloud particle sizes and several subsets concerning specific 
cloud system types (i.e., convective tracking, cyclone tracking, 
pattern recognition analysis for tropics and midlatitudes).


To celebrate this occasion, as well as to take stock of research 
progress and discuss plans for the future, a Symposium was 
held at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA) Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the 
Global Processing Center for ISCCP. About 40 scientists from 
six countries participated. The presentations are posted on the 
ISCCP website at: http://isccp.giss.nasa.gov/index.html.


Invited speakers began each topic session: J. Hansen (NASA 
GISS, Clouds in Climate); R. Schiffer [University of Mary-


Participants at the ISCCP Anniversary Symposium


land, Baltimore County, International Satellite Cloud Cli-
matology Project (ISCCP) Evolution from Lake Balaton to 
GEWEX]; J.J. Bates [National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) National Climatic Data Center, 
Producing Climate Data Records]; C. Stubenrauch [Labo-
ratoire de Météorologie Dynamique, Cloud Properties from 
Remote Sensing]; A.D. Del Genio (NASA GISS, Cloud Be-
havior from Remote Sensing); E. Raschke (Hamburg Univer-
sity, Cloud Effects on the Radiation Budget); C. Kummerow 
[Colorado State Unicersity (CSU), Clouds in the Hydrologi-
cal Cycle]; and G. Stephens (CSU, New Frontiers in Cloud 
Remote Sensing).


Three discussion sessions took place at the meeting, concern-
ing: (1) making ISCCP “operational,” (2) the way forward to 
understanding cloud-climate feedbacks and (3) future cloud 
research. One idea that was discussed for the operational ver-
sion of ISCCP involved a more intimate merger of the imaging 
and sounding instruments on the polar orbiting satellites that 
form the anchor for the data set: several possible approaches 
were suggested. Another concern was about “operational” cli-
mate data set production, particuarly the need for continual 
evaluation (and correction if needed) by the research com-
munity. No clear way forward on cloud-climate feedback was 
identified, so it is clear that new analysis approaches need to 
be developed that can reduce the complexity of the problem 
without sacrificing the validity of the results. Some early steps 
along these lines were presented at the Symposium and many 
informal discussions took place during breaks about new 
approaches and collaborations. The discussion of the newer 
cloud measurements indicates that the next several years of 
research should produce important results; there were also 
discussions about how to combine results from many differ-
ent kinds of instruments most effectively. In particular, the 
time resolution of the geostationary imaging measurements 
has to be combined with the more extensive spectral informa-
tion and vertical profiling from polar orbiting instruments to 
construct a complete view of the dynamics of cloud systems.


The ISCCP products have now developed into one of the lon-
gest time records of global cloud variations and have become 
part of the Global Climate Observing System. Approval of 
continuing funding now makes it possible to switch the anal-
ysis from the 30-km sampled radiances to the 10-km sampled 


radiances, which will provide results at nearly 
the full (infrared) resolution and make the 
products statistically more robust for cloud 
process studies. While ISCCP was not origi-
nally designed as a “climate data record,” with 
the record length growing there is more inter-
est in that use. There are a number of features 
that make the current products less useful for 
that purpose, but approval has been obtained 
to re-engineer the ISCCP processing system 
to improve the quality enough to form a 
cloud Climate Data Record and to make the 
whole project “operational” to continue into 
the future.

GEWEX Executive and
Joint CLIVAR-GEWEX Executive Meetings


25–26 August 2008
Silver Spring, Maryland USA


Peter van Oevelen
Director, International GEWEX Project Office, Silver Spring, MD, 
USA


The GEWEX Executive Meeting was hosted by the Inter-
national GEWEX Project Office (IGPO). IGPO staff met 
with the three GEWEX Panel Chairs and the Chair of the 
Scientific Steering Group (SSG) to review GEWEX ac-
tivities and planning based on guidance given by the SSG 
and the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) 
Joint Scientific Council. Following the GEWEX Execu-
tive Meeting, IGPO hosted a 2-day joint meeting with the 
Climate Variability and Predictability Project (CLIVAR) 
Executive members to discuss current and future collabo-
ration between the two programs and their roles within 
WCRP for the next 2 to 5 years. 


During the GEWEX Executive Meeting, the GEWEX 
Panels presented their progress and future plans, empha-
sizing cross-panel cooperation. While we are clearly on the 
right track as we tighten links between the panels, much 
can still be done. Discussions included how to strengthen 
the ways in which modelling development completed by 
the GEWEX Modelling and Prediction Panel relates to 
modelling activities completed by other GEWEX proj-
ects and working groups, particularly in acquiring clar-
ity on matters such as model parameterization and model 
improvement activities versus model diagnostics. One of 
the challenges for the GEWEX Radiation Panel (GRP) is 
how to create data sets from the latest observing systems 
that enhance rather than replace long time series such as 
the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project. To  
address this issue GRP is looking at “families” of products 


Participants at the GEWEX Executive and Joint CLIVAR-GEWEX Executive Meetings


that each serve distinct needs but share underlying proper-
ties. Under the Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Ob-
servations Project (CEOP), the GEWEX Panel for hydro- 
climate studies, work on a Multi-Model Analysis for CEOP 
to produce an ensemble mean and variance data set to sup-
port CEOP science activities was presented. Both CEOP 
co-chairs also showed how CEOP has been progressing 
since the its merger with the GEWEX Hydrometeorology 
Panel in 2007. 


At the joint GEWEX/CLIVAR Executive Meeting, two 
primary issues were addressed. The first, how to implement 
WCRP crosscuts—in particular, Monsoons and Extremes. 
For the crosscuts it was agreed that a new panel or steering 
group would be counterproductive and difficult to man-
age for both projects. Instead, the idea to have short-term 
(1–3 year) thrusts focusing on tangible tasks that address a 
specific aspect of monsoons or extremes was deemed very 
useful and feasible. These so-called foci would be led by a 
small team of dedicated scientists involved in the actual 
work. The joint executive proposed to bring this idea for-
ward during the Pan-WCRP Monsoon meeting held in 
Beijing, China, on 20–25 October 2008. For the extremes 
crosscut, Ronald Stewart and David Legler took up the 
challenge to work this out with respect to droughts.


The second issue focused on a strategy for the production 
of a “legacy document” in which each program addresses 
its vision with respect to the future of WCRP as a whole. 
GEWEX will take a two-tier approach in which its panels 
and working groups will be asked to contribute to a docu-
ment much like the GEWEX Phase I Accomplishment 
Brochure (http://gewex.org/GEWEXAccompBroc.pdf) that 
contains short descriptions of the areas where significant 
advancements have been made and the challenges that have 
been addressed. The second step will look forward, both in 
the relative short to medium timeframe of 2–5 years and 
the longer term (beyond 2013). An overview will be as-
sembled based upon the input from the GEWEX commu-


nity in which the research areas 
and activities that need to be 
instigated, continued or phased 
out will be presented, along 
with a rationale. The challenges 
that remain or that have not yet 
been addressed will be present-
ed as well. The collection of the 
legacy documents from all the 
WCRP-involved projects will 
serve as the basis for discussions 
related to future WCRP plans.


The GEWEX and CLIVAR Ex-
ecutive members reiterated their 
intention to continue working 
together to serve the internation- 
al research community.

Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment


2nd CEOP Annual Meeting 


15–17 September 2008 
Geneva, Switzerland 


Sam Benedict
International GEWEX Project Office, Silver Spring, MD, USA


The meeting, hosted by the World Climate Research Pro-
gramme (WCRP), focused on the finalization of the Scien-
tific Implementation Plan (SIP) for the GEWEX Coordinat-
ed Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project (CEOP). 
The SIP and copies of all of the meeting presentation mate-
rials—including abstracts of talks and posters—are available 
at the CEOP home page: http://www.ceop.net.


In his opening talk, Dr. Ghassem Asrar, the Director of 
WCRP, noted that since CEOP assumed responsibility for 
all GEWEX hydroclimate activities in 2007, the Project has 
accepted a new role in undertaking unique scientific stud-
ies and promoting research on the use of model prediction 
ensembles and associated statistics by comparing them with 
observations, and making these results available to other re-
searchers for further analysis. CEOP has also devoted consid-
erable efforts and resources to assemble and make available 
sustained regional reference observations of key meteoro-
logical and radiation parameters, together with analysis tools 
and methods, standards for archiving, distributing, analysis 
and visualization of these observations for scientists around 
the world. In this context CEOP is encouraged to continue 
its focus on contributions to GEWEX that support WCRP 
mission objectives as established in the WCRP Strategic 
Framework 2005–2015: to “support climate-related decision 
making and planning adaptation to climate change by devel-
oping science required to improve climate predictions, the 
understanding of human influence on climate, and use this 
scientific knowledge in an increasing range of practical appli-
cations of direct relevance, benefit and value to society.” 


In his presentation, the Chairman of the GEWEX Scien-
tific Steering Group called on CEOP to contribute signifi-
cantly more to major efforts that are underway to reduce 
uncertainties associated with the climatically sensitive and 
key hydrological processes in regions where CEOP is ac-
tive, and ensure their proper representation in the climate 
system models.


Also addressed at the meeting was the Global Earth Obser-
vation System of Systems (GEOSS) 10-Year Implementa-
tion Plan Reference Document, which states that CEOP 
should be considered as a prototype of GEOSS. Recogniz-
ing this as an ultimate achievement of CEOP, part of the 
meeting was organized around this theme with the intent 
of showing the unique nature of the collaboration between 
CEOP, the international group of numerical weather pre-
diction centers, and the broader climate research commu-
nity represented by the World Meteorological Organiza-
tion, WCRP and GEWEX as they all move toward the 
implementation of GEOSS. 


In this context, the Senior Scientific Expert for the Group 
on Earth Observations (GEO) water activities recommend-
ed that CEOP pay close attention to actions related to its 
contributions to Water Task WA-06-02 (Droughts, Floods 
and Water Resource Management) and Water Task WA-08-
01 (Integrated Products for Water Resource Management 
and Research) in the near term (2009–2011). CEOP will 
meet its commitments to GEO by maintaining its contin-
ued efforts to improve models and enhance the quality and 
integration of important hydroclimate data sets. Addition-
ally, CEOP will make an immediate contribution to the 
GEO Portal, a web-based interface for searching and ac-
cessing the data, information, imagery, services and appli-
cations at http://www.earthobservations.org. 


The presentations and breakout periods organized at the 
meeting emphasized the expansion of the scope of CEOP 
science activities. In addition to the Regional Hydrocli-
mate Projects (RHPs), CEOP includes groups focused on 
studies in high elevations, monsoon, extremes, cold regions 
and semi-arid regions. A special session associated with the 
CEOP Monsoons Study showed how it is synergistic with 
the overall WCRP Monsoon Crosscut Initiative. A special 
session on the CEOP High Elevation Study identified the 
possibility of organizing a global high elevation watch pe-
riod. The review of CEOP Extremes studies showed that 
CEOP will continue to focus on drought, heavy precipita-
tion, floods and low flows, including (in some instances) 
the intermeshing of these extremes. At the same time the 
links between the CEOP Cold Regions Study and several 
RHPs were clearly identified. This work will also be coor-
dinated with the WCRP Climate and Cryosphere (CliC) 
Project. A review of semi-arid regions studies showed prog-
ress on meeting the goals established for this element of 
CEOP.

The talks also showed that CEOP science continues to 
provide a traditional focus on Water and Energy budgets, 
which will extend efforts to understand average conditions 
as well as conditions during the entire CEOP period. The 
other CEOP science efforts reviewed at the meeting in-
cluded a study of the influence of aerosols and the study 
of water isotopes. A review of CEOP modelling efforts was 
also undertaken at the meeting including explicit global, 
regional, land surface, and Hydrologic Applications Project 
(HAP) reports. All of these modelling groups are looking 
at an ensemble of international models in many different 
regions focused on the CEOP reference sites that were de-
scribed at the meeting, along with the CEOP satellite data 
set during a review of the CEOP Data Management com-
ponent. With respect to the data issues facing CEOP, it was 
concluded that a systematic effort was needed to match this 
expanded CEOP science framework with new and better 
specialized data sets and data integration tools.  This led to 
a number of points of discussion associated with the need 
for:


(1) Better data sets and data integration tools with 
increased focus on defining and generating new 
multi-sensor, multi-scale integrated data sets.


(2) CEOP to aggressively pursue the fulfillment of 
commitments made by international participants 
in CEOP to provide, validate, archive and stage 
the complete baseline data set prescribed in the 
initial CEOP requirements. 


(3) CEOP to maintain its relationship with data ar-
chive centers at the University Corporation for 
Atmospheric Research, the Max-Planck Institute, 
the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and the 
University of Tokyo. 


(4) CEOP Co-Chairs to ensure that space agencies—
through the Committee on Earth Observation 
Satellites and other important funding groups—
are encouraged to actively support the CEOP im-
plementation process. 


(5) CEOP to coordinate Regional Hydroclimate Proj-
ects efforts in the provision and integration of the 
new data types necessary to achieve CEOP science 
objectives. 


(6) Cooperation with other groups within WCRP 
and GEWEX that are producing specialized data 
sets necessary to meet the CEOP data set require-
ments.


The 3rd Annual CEOP Meeting is scheduled to be held 19–
21 August 2009 in Melbourne, Australia, prior to the paral-
lel GEWEX and Integrated Land Ecosystem-Atmospheric 
Processes Study Science Conferences with joint sessions be-

1 Introduction 


Many different fields of knowledge have benefited from the use of cluster analysis, a general 


term for an ever growing number of techniques belonging to the wide domain of exploratory 


data analysis. From psychology, and other social sciences, to biology, medicine, data mining, 


statistics, information retrieval, pattern recognition, climate, remote sensing, machine learning, 


and marketing, clustering techniques have been successfully applied to practical problems, 


either for understanding (e.g., identify different variants of psychological depression), or utility 


(e.g., data compression). More precisely, cluster analysis divides data into groups (clusters), 


based on the abstract assumption that there is an underlying grouping in the data structure, 


either as separate sets of individuals, or a hierarchy of groups. This is done based exclusively 


on information intrinsic to the data, and is for this reason usually called unsupervised 


classification or unsupervised learning. 


Depending on the specific problem, the most suitable clustering technique will necessarily be 


some flavor of a number of main approaches, such as prototype-based clustering (e.g., K-


means Clustering), hierarchical clustering (e.g., Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering), or 


density-based clustering (e.g., DBSCAN [Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications 


with Noise]). For many climate-related problems, the nature of the phenomenology, and or the 


approach taken to tackle it (e.g., weather patterns, climate regimes, cloud characteristics) make 


prototype-based, and particularly K-means clustering, a reasonable choice (e.g., Jakob and 


Tselioudis 2003; Rossow et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2007). As a prototype-based technique, the 


K-means (iterative) algorithm generates a single partitioning of the data into a number of (K) 


clusters and associated centroids (ideal prototypes representing the center of each set of data 


objects [cluster], such that each object is more similar [following the evaluation of a proximity 


measure] to its prototype than to the prototype of any of the other sets). However, the fact that 


K is a user-specified parameter, and because the prototypes (initial or final) do not necessarily 


correspond to actual data objects (note also that random initialization [of centroids] is often 


used with this technique), gives K-means a certain degree of subjectivity, even if additional 


tests are performed (e.g., multiple runs of the technique, each starting with different sets of 


initial centroids).

In an attempt to overcome some of the issues of the traditional K-means clustering technique 


(specially in what concerns the random initialization of centroids, and the subjective 


specification of the number K), a new clustering technique is proposed here that, among other 


things: selects for the set of initial centroids, objects taken directly from the dataset being 


analyzed; presents a bound for the maximum number of test runs possible (based solely on the 


number of objects in the dataset); and, has the value for K as an objective outcome of the 


clustering analysis. These aspects of the new technique make it (purely) empirical in nature, 


most notably in the selection of the initial prototypes, themselves consistent with states of the 


system (represented by the dataset), and thus, physically meaningful in the specific context of 


its constrains (e.g., large-scale dynamics, environmental and thermodynamic conditions), and 


spatiotemporal domain. 


GEPAT (Grade-based Empirical Pattern Analysis Technique) will be introduced below, and 


applied to JJA 3-hourly TCC data for the investigation of potential clustering behaviour, 


corresponding to preferred patterns of the distribution of cloud cover along the GPCI cross 


section, and thus, of the cloud regime transitions that characterize the region. 


After a quick overview of some basic concepts crucial to understand the mechanics of cluster 


analysis, the section is essentially divided in two main parts, a first one dedicated to the basic 


GEPAT algorithm, with the steps involved in the employment of a (grade-based) proximity 


measure in the stages of selection, and assignment of dataset objects to a reference object; and 


a second part dedicated to the optimization process, through which a number of statistics are 


obtained from prospective clusterings, for inspection and validation of the relative merits of 


their data partitionings. Following a few additional remarks, the section ends with a couple of 


ideas on possible avenues for future development of the GEPAT approach. 


Introductory material on cluster analysis can be found, e.g., in Jain and Dubes (1988), 


Algorithms for Clustering Data, and in Tan et al. (2005), Introduction to Data Mining. An 


often referenced publication is also Anderberg (1973), Cluster Analysis for Applications. 


2 Basic concepts 


Pattern Space    The data objects mentioned above correspond, in this study, to 3-hourly 


records of TCC distributed along the 13 points of the GPCI cross section. Each one of these 


records (or data units) represents a (spatial) TCC pattern and can be seen as a single point in a 


- 2 - 







13-dimensional pattern space. Each point in this space can be denoted by a vector, whose (13) 


components (or attributes) are the scalars corresponding to the TCC values at each location in 


the GPCI transect. 


Normalization    To prepare the data for the cluster analysis, it is required that all 13 attributes 


of each data unit be available. Additionally, it is usually recommendable to perform some sort 


of normalization (e.g., for zero mean and unit variance), adjusted to the chosen proximity 


measure. Given the fact that all 13 attributes of each TCC pattern correspond to the same data 


type and scale, no a priori normalization has been applied to the data, also because the 


proximity measure adopted has a scaling factor based on the standard deviation (the details are 


given below). Care should be taken, though, to understand the impact this kind of data 


manipulation has, in potentially changing the separation between natural clusters. 


Types of Clusterings    The term clustering refers to the collection of all clusters (natural or 


proposed by cluster analysis) present in a dataset. A clustering can be classified in a number of 


ways, that basically translate the relations between individual clusters. For instance, 


hierarchical clustering is used for nested clusters, while non-overlapping clusters characterize 


a partitional clustering. If each data unit is assigned to a single cluster, the clustering is 


classified as exclusive, on the other hand, if an object belongs to more than one cluster, the 


clustering is called non-exclusive, or overlapping. A clustering will be complete if every object 


is assigned to a cluster, and partial otherwise. 


Types of Clusters    Clusters that are far from each other, such that the intra-cluster distance 


between any two objects of the same cluster is smaller than the minimum distance between any 


of the clusters, are said to be well-separated clusters. Density-based clustering abstracts 


clusters as being regions of higher object density than its surroundings. For prototype-based 


clusters, a reference point is determined, usually as a centroid (e.g., the average of all the 


points in the cluster), to which all the points in the cluster are similar to a higher degree than to 


the prototypes of any of the other clusters. 


Proximity Measures    In prototype-based cluster analysis, the assignment of an object to a 


centroid is done based on the evaluation of a proximity measure, designed specifically for the 


data, and goal, of the cluster analysis. Objects are typically assigned to the “closest” centroid. 


A proximity measure can be either a dissimilarity, e.g., Euclidian distance in a pattern space; or 


a similarity, e.g., the grade-based index employed in GEPAT, formally defined as follows:

where i and j represent two patterns (j being a centroid, for instance), d represents a particular 


dimension in the pattern space (or, in this study, a specific location along the GPCI cross 


section), n is the total number of dimensions of the pattern space (n = 13, the total number of 


points along the cross section), vid and vjd are the dth components of the vectors representing 


patterns i and j, respectively, ?d is the standard deviation calculated from the variation of the 


values of the dth component of all the patterns in the dataset, and N represents the number of 


standard deviations to be applied. 


As mentioned above, there is a scaling factor involved in the application of Eq. (A.1). It affects 


the 13 vector components of each pattern in the dataset differently, depending on the 


corresponding standard deviation (N?d, more precisely). Given the possible range of values of 


the TCC parameter (0 % to 100 %), and assuming typical N?d &gt; 1 %, this essentially implies, 


for gij, a context in which the population of patterns (and concomitantly of any natural clusters) 


is, in relation to the original data, nonuniformly contracted toward the origin of the 13-


dimensional pattern space. This means that this proximity measure evaluates scaled distances 


between patterns: ( )djdidjdid Nvvvv ??=? ** . Finally, it should be noted that a percent version of 


the gij index is preferably used, that is, 100gij × . 


A Grading Threshold    In GEPAT, the application of the proximity measure presented above 


is done, in a first stage, with the purpose of selecting a set of reference patterns, expected to, at 


east to some degree, represent an equivalent number of clusters in the data, and, thus, required 


to be different from each other by a corresponding amount. For that end, an upper threshold 


(T0) is imposed on the value of the grade when evaluated between pairs of prospective 


reference patterns (this process is presented below in more detail). 


In summary, using the basic concepts presented above, it can be said that GEPAT is a 


prototype-based technique intended for complete and exclusive partitional clustering, resorting 


to a similarity proximity measure constrained by an upper threshold.

3 The basic GEPAT algorithm 


The first part of the application of GEPAT to a dataset of patterns is relatively straightforward, 


and can be divided into the following four steps: 


1: Selection of a Starting Reference Pattern (SRP) 


2: Formation of a set of Reference Patterns (RPs) 


3: Assignment of each pattern to the most similar RP 


4: Computation of the cluster centroids (Centroid Patterns [CPs]) 


The SRP from the first step (1:) is an actual pattern, and can be randomly selected among the 


patterns that form the dataset being analyzed. In practice, the first available pattern of the 


seasonal record of TCC has been chosen as the SRP. At step 2:, an iteration on the entire 


dataset is performed, aimed at finding RPs in addition to the SRP. The iteration starts with the 


SRP as a reference pattern, against which the other patterns are graded using the GEPAT 


proximity measure of similarity. The order used for the iteration corresponded to the temporal 


order of the dataset patterns, as they were obtained during the season. If a pattern is found to be 


similar to the SRP by less than a specified threshold (e.g., T0 = 20 %) it is classified as a new 


RP. The iteration proceeds, and an additional RP is determined every time a pattern grades by 


less than the specified threshold against each and every one of the RPs gathered until that 


point. At the end of the iteration, together, the SRP and all the additional RPs, form the final 


set of Reference Patterns. Note that no constraint is imposed on the total number of RPs found 


(this number is a function of T0, SRP, and the order chosen for the iteration sequence). For the 


assignment process that takes place at step 3:, all patterns in the dataset are graded against each 


one of the RPs selected in the previous step (2:), and assigned to the RP that gives the highest 


grade, that is, the RP most similar to it. Finally, at step 4:, two basic statistics are obtained for 


each one of the RPs (clusters) found: the representativeness, calculated as the percentage of 


patterns assigned to a given RP, relative to the total number of patterns in the dataset; and a 


second statistics, corresponding to the average (mean) of all the patterns assigned to a given 


RP, called the Centroid Pattern (CP), and representing the centroid (center) of the 


corresponding cluster of patterns. It should be noted that, with GEPAT, no empty clusters are 


formed, since all RPs will at least be singletons – given the fact that to a RP is assigned, at 


least, the corresponding pattern.

4 Partitioning evaluation 


Having obtained a GEPAT clustering using the basic algorithm introduced above, it would be 


important to gain some insight on the adequacy of its partitioning. Ideally, this should be done 


in an objective fashion resorting to quantitative information extracted from the clustering itself. 


Though still not a well-developed, or extensively used, part of cluster analysis, a number of 


approaches have been developed for cluster evaluation (also called cluster validation). This 


section presents the first stage of GEPAT's optimization procedure. In fact, contrary to 


traditional practice, cluster evaluation is at the core of this new technique. 


Clustering Criteria and Objective Functions    The development of any prototype-based 


partitional clustering entails the adoption of some kind of clustering criterion amenable to 


quantification. This criterion can also be viewed as an objective function that expresses the 


goal of the clustering. Essentially, it is expected that this function be a single diagnostic 


measure of the overall goodness of a partitioning, so that the relative merits of two clusterings 


of the same data can be inferred by comparing the values of the measure for each clustering. 


For GEPAT, the goal could be stated as the maximization of the grades of each pattern versus 


the most similar centroids, so that the best clustering would be the one with the highest overall 


(e.g., mean) grade. This would suffice, but, as detailed below, in defining an objective 


function, GEPAT goes beyond this relatively simple approach. 


Two Basic Statistics    The introduction of two additional basic concepts seems appropriate at 


this point: the size of a clustering (K), and the size of a cluster (Si). K is the total number of 


clusters found by a cluster analysis, and Si is the number of patterns in a given cluster (which 


can also be given as a representativeness percentage [Si%], as defined above in the fourth step 


of the basic GEPAT algorithm). 


Indices of Cluster Validity    Cluster validation typically resorts to statistically-based indices, 


and numerical measures, applied to inspect various aspects of a clustering structure, and aimed 


at an objective judgement of the corresponding partitioning. These indices can be classified as 


unsupervised (or internal), or supervised (or external) evaluation measures, depending, 


respectively, on their use of information exclusively present in the data set, or information 


from sources external to the data set. When specifically applied for the purpose of comparing 


different clusterings, or different clusters, these measures (internal or external) are called 


relative indices. In the current application of GEPAT, only unsupervised measures are used, in 


- 6 - 







combination, and in a relative-index framework. Note, finally, that internal indices can be 


further categorized into measures of cluster cohesion (tightness, compactness), and measures 


of cluster separation (isolation). While the former indicate how much alike the patterns in a 


cluster are, the latter translate the degree of isolation between a cluster and other clusters. As 


will be seen below, GEPAT presents alternative indices that may not directly fit in any of these 


two categories. 


The Singleton Index (SI)    This index is defined for a given clustering as the ratio between 


the number of clusters with more than one pattern assigned to it (or, equivalently, all GEPAT 


clusters that remain if the singleton clusters are disregarded) and the size of the clustering (K). 


SI is a continuous measure with values on a 0 to 1 scale. 


The Cluster Grade (CG)    The Cluster Grade is the mean value of the grades between each 


pattern in a cluster and the corresponding RP. CG varies continuously on a 0 % to 100 % scale. 


The Mean CP Grade (MG)    An overall grade for the CPs in a clustering, MG is defined as 


the mean of the CGs from all the clusters. To some extent, MG offers insight on the global 


degree of cluster cohesion. 


The CPs' Degree of Dissimilarity (DD)    The first step to obtain this quantity is the 


calculation of the grades for all the pairs of CPs that can be formed by combining all the CPs 


of a clustering two-by-two. The mean value of these grades, called the CPs' Degree of 


Similarity (DS), is then subtracted from 100 to give GEPAT's DD, a 0 % to 100 % continuous 


measure that, at least in a first approximation, can be seen as an unsupervised measure of the 


overall degree of separation between the clusters. 


The Smoothness of the Cluster-Size Distribution (SS)    This measure uses the size of the 


individual clusters in the form of representativeness percentages (Si%, defined above), firstly to 


evaluate what is here called the Absolute Roughness of the cluster-size distribution (AR), 


defined below in Eq. (A.2). AR can be seen as the sum of the areas of rectangles with width b, 


and heights (hSi%) given by the difference between the highest value of cluster 


representativeness (S0%) and the representativeness of a particular cluster (Si%):

- 7 - 







where K is the size of the clustering. Because AR can be greater than 100 %, a factor to 


normalize the absolute roughness (fNR) is used. fNR is evaluated using the same equation for 


AR (Eq. A.2), but for a theoretical situation in which a clustering with the same size K would 


have a S0% of 100 %, and consequently, Si% equal to 0 % for all the other K-1 clusters. This is 


only an abstract generalization, since a value S0% = 100 % could only correspond to a situation 


with K = 1. Equation (A.2) would then take the form: 


 


( )[ ]1100 ?= KbfNR (A.3) 


 


where K-1 results from the fact that the rectangle corresponding to S0% (equal to 100 %, in the 


abstract case) has a height hS0% equal to 0 % (and would not contribute any area to fNR). 


Dividing AR by fNR, and multiplying the result by 100, gives a degree of Normalized 


Roughness (dNR) calculated as:

Finally, the smoothness of the cluster-size distribution is simply:  


 


(A.5) dNRSS ?=100


 


SS is a 0 % to 100 % continuous measure. 


A Global Index of Clustering Validity (G)    Plainly put, the maximization of either MG or 


DD, could, single-handedly, be used as the basic criteria for GEPAT's objective function. 


However, not only those two important measures of cluster validity (respectively for cohesion, 


and for separation) are used in combination, but, information from other two unsupervised 


measures (SI and SS) is also included in the computation of GEPAT's global index of 


clustering validity (G). Using the same notation as above, G is calculated as follows:

In Eq. (A.6), the average between the two more traditional measures (MG and DD) is 


multiplied by the Singleton Index (SI), and the linear average between this result and the 


Smoothness of the Cluster Size Distribution (SS), is then the final value for G. From the 


definitions of the four indices used in Eq. (A.6), it can be expected that, for instance, the lower 


the SI, the higher MG will be, since the (undesired) singleton clusters contribute to MG with a 


CG of 100 %. 


Summarizing, GEPAT’s goal is then stated as the maximization of this global index (G), such 


that, the best one of two clusterings is the one with the highest G (again, the indices of 


clustering validity are used in GEPAT, typically, as relative indices). 


5 Iterating for the remaining partitionings 


A recurring issue with prototype-based partitional techniques has to do with the sensitiveness 


of the objective function to the initialization of the cluster analysis. Indeed, in addition to the 


fact that these techniques converge to a final clustering that often only offers a local extreme of 


the objective function (a maximum, or a minimum, depending on the specific clustering 


criterion), the results are generally different for different sets of initial centroids, or RPs, in 


GEPAT terminology. 


Theoretically, this problem could be solved by evaluating the chosen objective function for all 


possible partitions (e.g., of a specified size K, as in K-means, or, in GEPAT terms, associated 


with all possible SRPs [even if not actual patterns, thinking about an abstract application of 


GEPAT] and a specified T0), and pick the one that optimizes the function. This seems 


straightforward, but is impractical due to the astronomical number of partitions, even for 


relatively small data sets. 


Several approaches to limit the number of partitions to be evaluated, and for the selection of 


initial centroids, have been proposed, and discussed, in the literature (e.g., selecting the initial 


centroids from random samples of patterns). In the currently implemented version, GEPAT 


objectively suggests a specific set of such experiments, whose number is tied to the number of 


patterns in the dataset. More precisely, what is proposed is, to perform as many runs of the 


basic GEPAT algorithm, as the number of patterns in the dataset, by using, in each run, a 


different pattern as a SRP (step 1: of the basic algorithm presented previously). The role of 


- 9 - 







GEPAT's global index of clustering validity, G, as a relative index is then, to help pick the 


partitioning for which it is optimized (the one with the highest G). 


G Disambiguation    It cannot be ruled out that two, or more, GEPAT clusterings of a given 


dataset, and for a specified grading threshold T0, end up having the same value for the global 


index G. In these cases, a strategy has been adopted, in which the values of the individual 


terms in Eq. (A.6) are closely inspected for the purposes of G disambiguation. At this point in 


GEPAT's development, and for the particular dataset with the (JJA) seasonal record of TCC 


along the GPCI cross section, the disambiguation procedure is as follows: 1) if between two 


clusterings with the same G, all the terms in Eq. (A.6) have the same respective value in both 


clusterings, then the clustering corresponding to the SRP obtained earlier in the record 


sequence is picked as the final solution of the cluster analysis; 2) if, on the other hand, there are 


differences in the values of the individual terms in Eq. (A.6), the choice for the final solution 


will be, firstly, the clustering for which SI is highest, or, additionally, if there is still more than 


one clustering with the same highest SI, the clustering for which MG, DD, and finally SS, are 


highest, if at any point in the evaluation sequence there is still the need for further 


disambiguation; 3) finally, if still, two or more clusterings share the same extreme value for SS, 


then again, as in 1), the clustering corresponding to the SRP obtained earlier in the record 


sequence is picked as the final solution of the cluster analysis. 


6 Basic thresholding 


Knowing that the final solution mentioned above is the result of the application of GEPAT 


using a specific grading threshold T0, it seems pertinent to, for a given data set, inquire on the 


characteristics of the final solution for different grading thresholds, namely in what concerns 


the values attained by the different measures of cluster validity that are used in the calculation 


of G. 


For that end, it is current practice with GEPAT, to perform what is here referred to as Basic 


Thresholding. It is no more than obtaining the final GEPAT solution for several grading 


thresholds between 0 % and 100 %, in a number that will depend on the needs of the particular 


clustering investigation (e.g. 5 % T resolution). 


7 Choosing a particular clustering (K0) 


- 10 - 







For practical reasons, it may be of interest to look at particular clusterings, namely in what 


concerns the total number of clusters in it, or clustering size. This is specially the case when 


the goal is to look at the CPs from the cluster analysis of different datasets, and qualitatively 


evaluate them in an intercomparison framework. 


Through the thresholding methodology presented above, GEPAT offers a way to perform the 


search for the desired clustering of size K0, by successively narrowing the thresholding 


interval, and increasing the thresholding resolution, to find the T0 that gives a final GEPAT 


solution of size K0. Note that, fixing the value of K, will, potentially, result in different T0 


values for the final solutions of different datasets. 


More generally, a first search usually allows K to vary on a specified range of values suitable 


for the purposes of a particular investigation (as opposed to fixing it). This is typically 


performed on a dataset to be used as the reference in the intercomparison effort (e.g., 


observational data). The chosen K0 is then fixed for the other data sets. 


Using the values of K, MG, DD, SI, and SS, obtained for a basic thresholding (e.g., with a 5 % 


T resolution), a sequence of steps to find the K0 clustering has been defined as follows: 1) 


record the T interval for which K is greater than 1 and lower than the total number of patterns 


in the data set (e.g., T = ]0 to 95[ %); 2) redefine the interval from 1), by taking its interception 


with the T interval for which the measure SI is equal to 1 (e.g., T = ]0 to 45] %); 3) taking into 


account the interval from 2), define the range of K values useful for the specific goal of the 


investigation (e.g., K between 3 and 8), and annotate the interception of the corresponding T 


interval with the interval from 2) (e.g., T = [20 to 25] %); finally, 4) perform a higher-


resolution thresholding of the T interval from 3) and pick the threshold T0 that offers the best 


compromise between the different clustering validity measures; this T0 will then correspond to 


a particular K0 (e.g., T0 = 25 % and K0 = 6). 


As noted above, usually firstly obtained for the reference dataset, the value K0 is then fixed for 


the other datasets of interest, when going through the four-step sequence presented in the 


previous paragraph with the goal to search for the corresponding (K0) final clustering solutions. 


In that case, step 4) is simply used for the choice of the K0-sized clustering corresponding to 


the lowest value of T in the interval (this ensures that the clustering chosen will be the one with 


the highest degree of dissimilarity [at least among the corresponding set of RPs]). 


One alternative to the approach presented above would be to, instead, fix a grading threshold 


T0, and look at the differences between the GEPAT results of the different data sets. 


- 11 - 







8 RPing 


A step further in the application of the GEPAT methodology, RPing is, in the general case, 


based on the imposition of a user-specified set of RPs in substitution of steps 1: and 2: of the 


basic GEPAT algorithm presented earlier. Note that: i) it is necessary that those RPs and the 


patterns of the dataset being investigated belong to the same pattern space; ii) there is no 


grading threshold involved in RPing; and iii) RPing is performed in a single run of the basic 


GEPAT algorithm. 


Most notably, RPing can be used for the direct comparison of the clustering structure of two 


different datasets by, for instance, imposing the RPs of a particular clustering of a reference 


dataset (e.g., obtained following the sequence of steps presented above in Choosing A 


Particular Clustering [K0]) as the basis for the cluster analysis of the second dataset. In this 


regard, RPing would be useful, for example, in the evaluation of how well model simulation 


data clusters around a set of RPs from a particular clustering of an observational dataset of 


reference. Insight on the relative goodness of such a clustering could then be obtained by 


comparing the various measures of cluster validity between the two data sets, in particular, the 


distribution of the cluster representativeness (Si%) and the mean CP grade (MG). 


Other uses for RPing can be easily envisioned, specially in face of its various disguises. 


Conventional and Nonconventional RPing    When the set of RPs specified in RPing is taken 


from the result of the regular application of GEPAT to a reference dataset (either from a single 


run of the basic GEPAT algorithm, or from a final solution of the iteration through all the 


possible GEPAT partitionings, or even, from the choice of a particular K0 clustering), the 


RPing is called conventional. On the other hand, if the set of user-specified RPs has patterns 


subjectively taken from a dataset (or several datasets), the RPing is said to be nonconventional. 


Insourced and Outsourced RPing    If among the set of specified RPs, one pattern (or more) 


come from a dataset other than the one being subject to RPing, the RPing is considered 


outsourced. In contrast, when all the patterns belong to the dataset under evaluation, the RPing 


is considered insourced. Both, conventional and nonconventional RPing can be insourced or 


outsourced. 


The Scaling Factor in RPing    As mentioned above, only a single run of the basic GEPAT 


algorithm is used in RPing, with steps 1: and 2: of the basic algorithm being substituted by a 


set of user-specified RPs. This means that GEPAT's proximity measure is only used at step 3: 


- 12 - 







of the basic algorithm, for the assignment of each pattern in the dataset to the most similar RP. 


Recall now that, the scaling factor embedded in the equation of the proximity measure, 


depends, by definition, on the standard deviation of the (vectorial) components of the dataset 


patterns. A relevant question is then raised in a RPing context: which standard deviation 


information should be used with the proximity measure at step 3: of the basic algorithm? 


Although there is no a priori convention on this, it is current practice to, for conventional 


RPing (outsourced or insourced), use in the evaluation of the proximity measure, standard 


deviation information obtained from the same dataset as the (specified) RPs; and, for 


nonconventional RPing (outsourced or insourced), to use standard deviation information, 


exclusively, from the dataset being subject to RPing. 


Finally, it should be noted that, in the case of outsourced RPing (of any type) it can happen that 


some of the external RPs end up resulting in empty clusters. This is contrary to what would 


happen in a regular GEPAT application (for which, as previously explained, any cluster is at 


least a singleton). No specific treatment of empty clusters is currently performed in GEPAT. 


This is a matter left for future developments of the technique. 


From what was presented above, RPing could also be classified as forced cluster partitioning. 


9 Space and time requirements 


Depending on the specific application, and dataset parameters, GEPAT will require differing 


amounts of computer memory and computational time. A quick hint on the magnitude of those 


operational  requirements is given below. In what follows, m is the total number of patterns in 


a dataset, n is the number of dimensions of the pattern space (or the number of components of 


the pattern vectors), K is the size of a clustering, or the corresponding number of CPs (K' 


indicates clustering sizes that may vary for different runs of the basic GEPAT algorithm), g is 


the number of measures of cluster validity used to evaluated the clusterings, and l a number of 


specific GEPAT experiments. 


Single Run of the Basic GEPAT Algorithm    The storage required by a single run of the 


basic algorithm is O((m + K)n + g). In terms of time requirements, there is a first iteration on 


the entire set of m patterns for the formation of the set of initial RPs O(m?n), and then, K 


iterations on the m patterns for the assignment of patterns to the “closest” RP O(K(m?n)), 


which gives a total time O((K + 1)m*n).

Finding the Final GEPAT Solution    As mentioned above, the determination of the final 


GEPAT solution for a dataset of m patterns requires m runs of the basic algorithm, one for each 


one of the patterns in the dataset. The storage required will then be O(m?n + m(K'?n + g)) and, 


for the same reason, the time requirements will be O(m2?n(K' + 1)). 


Thresholding Experiments    GEPAT thresholding is typically performed with the goal of 


finding a particular clustering of size K0. For that end, a number of experiments are usually 


needed, each for a different value of the grading threshold. Individually, these experiments are 


intended to give a final GEPAT solution  for the respective grading threshold. Being l the total 


number of such experiments, the space requirements of the thresholding is then O(m?n + 


l?m(K'?n + g)), and the time requirements O(l*m2*n(K' + 1)). 


Taking into account that K and K' increase to m as the grading threshold T increases to 100 %, 


and recalling that a basic thresholding (T = 0 % to T = 100 % [e.g., 5 % by 5 %]) is usually 


recommended for an initial general overview of the clustering nature of a dataset, it can be 


concluded that the current version of GEPAT can easily become computationally expensive, 


specially for large datasets (m). 


10 Additional remarks 


T0 = 0 % and the Best-Liked Record    Whenever the basic GEPAT algorithm is run using a 


grading threshold T0 of 0 %, the result is a clustering of size 1, that is, a single cluster is 


formed, whose size is the total number of patterns in the dataset (recall the second step of the 


basic algorithm, 2: Formation of a set of Reference Patterns [RPs]). In other words, any SRP 


would necessarily become the sole RP of the analysis. Under these circumstances, any change 


in the value of G as evaluated for different runs of the basic algorithm using different SRPs, 


can only be attributed to changes in the value of the MG measure, since all the other indices of 


cluster validity involved in the computation of G, namely, DD, SI, and SS, remain unchanged 


at 0 %, 1, and 100 %, respectively. It can then be concluded that the final GEPAT solution for 


the dataset (the one with the highest G among the clustering results for all the dataset patterns 


taken as SRPs) will (for T0 = 0 %) be the one for which MG is the highest. As MG is, in this 


case, simply the mean value of the grades between each pattern in the dataset and the pattern 


used as the SRP, the pattern behind this SRP can then be said to be, overall, the one “best-


liked” by (or more “similar” to) the rest of the pattern population. Note that this pattern may 


- 14 - 







differ from the CP of the pattern set as a whole. Interestingly, for T0 = 0 %, the CP is, for the 


focus dataset, simply, the mean seasonal value of the TCC field along the GPCI cross section, 


as it is traditionally evaluated (e.g., Fig. 5.1). 


Tsat and the Saturation Domain    Compared with the situation presented above for a grading 


threshold T0 of 0%, the case of T0 = 100 % is at the other end of the GEPAT spectrum in what 


concerns the total number of clusters proposed by the analysis. In that case, a clustering of size 


K, equal to the total number of patterns in the dataset, will be obtained, independently of the 


SRP used. Each individual cluster will then correspond to a singleton (Si = 1). In fact, it often 


happens that this is (still) the case for thresholds lower than 100 %, and all the way down to 


what is, in GEPAT, called the saturation threshold, Tsat, defined, precisely, as the lowest 


grading threshold for which the resulting clustering is of size K. The T domain between Tsat 


and T = 100 % is known as the saturation domain. For any threshold T in this domain, the 


measures SI, and SS will always be 0, and 100 %, respectively, which, according to Eq. (A.6), 


results in a constant global index G of 50 %. Note also, that MG will remain at 100 % in the 


saturation domain (singletons have CGs of 100 %). For the DD measure, although it is constant 


too, its value will depend on the dissimilarity degree evaluated among all the individual 


patterns of the dataset, which makes it, in this particular context, an interesting measure to look 


at, when comparing the potential clustering nature of different datasets. Finally, keep in mind 


that Tsat corresponds to an upper limit of the value of the GEPAT's proximity measure for a 


given dataset, in the sense that the grade between any two patterns in the dataset will always be 


lower than Tsat. The less “similar” the dataset patterns, the lower the Tsat. 


? for DD    Given the fact that to calculate the CPs’ degree of dissimilarity, DD, there is the 


need to compare the entire set of (K) CPs of a clustering against each other using the proximity 


measure in Eq. (A.1), it could be argued that the standard deviations (?d) to be used in the 


evaluation of gij for DD, should be obtained for this particular set of patterns, that is, from the 


variability of each one of the n components of the CP patterns themselves. Using, instead, the 


?d calculated from the entire set of patterns in the dataset being analyzed (as is done in this 


study), implies only an approximation to that theoretically more precise evaluation of gij. Note 


though, that the larger the clustering size, K, the closer will the ?d obtained from the set of CPs 


be to the ?d obtained from the dataset as a whole (and, hence, more accurate the approximate 


version of gij will be). This is particularly true for any clustering obtained for a grading 


threshold T in the saturation domain, since each dataset pattern will itself be a CP, and, 


consequently, both ?d versions will coincide.

Flexibility or Subjectivity?    It is apparent, from what has this far been disclosed about 


GEPAT, that (not just for the fact that it is still under initial development) it is amenable to 


adjustment in several of its operational aspects, e.g., the exact form of the proximity measure 


adopted, the number and type of measures of cluster validity, as well as their combination in 


the equation for the global index, or the procedure for G disambiguation, among other things. 


These aspects can (and should) all be subject to further testing and improvement. The point 


here, though, is that GEPAT offers a great deal of flexibility, and that these, and any other 


future developments, can still be undertaken in the grade-based and purely-empirical 


framework it preconizes. 


Other Versions of GEPAT    The version of GEPAT introduced here is only one of a number 


of other versions developed up to date. More specifically, work has been done on two main 


versions of the proximity measure, one tailored for patterns corresponding to PDF distributions 


(PDF-based Absolute-departure Grading), and a second one built for patterns associated with 


spatial distributions of a given parameter (Field-based Critical-departure Grading). Either one 


of those two GEPAT approaches can be applied in a 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional context (or even 


in higher dimensions, in the PDF case). The PDF-based version has actually been developed, 


and tested, for a joint PDF (2D) framework, to study the clustering nature of a dataset made of 


TCC histograms much like the ones discussed in Section 5.1.2 (in fact, those jPFDs are made 


of 13 1D PDFs, one for each location along the GPCI cross section). The results analyzed later 


in this section, and in the next one, were obtained using the 1D, Field-based Critical-departure 


Grading GEPAT introduced in this thesis (the term “critical” is derived from the use, in the 


proximity measure, of the max function, and a scaling factor, as in Eq. A.1). 


11 Future developments 


A number of modifications to a few important components of the novel grade-based approach 


to clustering presented here are listed below. These refinement attempts are part of a larger 


catalogue of adjustments, whose implementation can potentially improve GEPAT, and, 


hopefully, make it less computationally demanding. 


The Proximity Measure    As presented in Eq. (A.1), the grade-based proximity measure 


yields the same result for two patterns that have: the same number of components with the 


same (&amp;lt;1) value of the scaled distance versus the respective reference-pattern’s components; 


- 16 - 







along with the same number of components with a value of zero for the max function, 


independent of the specific departure (versus the reference) of those components, beyond the 


respective value of the critical factor (N?d). This congenital flaw could be overcome by 


changing the proximity measure to the following one:

where (as in Eq. A.1) i and j are two patterns (j being a centroid, for instance), d represents the 


dimension in the pattern space, n is the total number of dimensions, vid and vjd are the dth 


components of the vectors representing patterns i and j, respectively, ?d is the standard 


deviation calculated from the variation of the values of the dth component among all the 


patterns in the dataset, and N represents the number of standard deviations to be applied. 


CPs instead of RPs for MG evaluation    As defined above, the mean CP grade, MG, is the 


mean of the CGs (Cluster Grades) from all the clusters in a given clustering. The CG, in turn, 


was defined as the mean value of the grades between each pattern in a cluster and the 


corresponding RP. Given the fact that a clustering is (for prototype-based techniques, as is 


GEPAT), ultimately, represented by its CPs, it seems more reasonable to redefine the CG and 


(concomitantly) the MG measures, so that they are, instead, calculated using the CPs as the 


reference. Note that MG would be the only measure affected by this adjustment, since DD is 


already CP-based, and the other two measures (SI, and SS) are based solely on the size of the 


individual clusters (a quantity that does not change with the new viewpoint). 


CPing    In line with the comments made in the previous item (CPs instead of RPs for MG 


evaluation), it would be important to adjust the RPing methodology so as to, alternatively, 


resort to CPs, instead of RPs. Keep in mind that what was said at Conventional and 


Nonconventional RPing, Insourced and Outsourced RPing, and The Scaling Factor in RPing, 


can be directly transposed to the CPing proposed here. 


GEPAT and K-means    In the basic K-means algorithm, an iterative, hill-climbing, 


methodology is used to find the clustering solution, towards which the underlying process is 


intended to converge. The K-means clustering solution often corresponds to (only) a local 


extreme of an objective function. In fact, due to a number of issues regarding the sensitivity of 


the algorithm to dataset parameters and cluster initialization, several experiments are usually 


performed in K-means to find the most adequate clustering (e.g., change the [user-specified] 


- 17 - 







parameter K, and choose the clustering that gives the “highest” value of an evaluation 


measure). With this in mind, and recalling the basic GEPAT algorithm, and its relative 


frugality (time requirements O((K + 1)m?n), as discussed earlier), as compared to K-means 


(time requirements O(I?K?m?n), where I is the number of iterations required for convergence 


in the basic K-means algorithm), it can be concluded that the GEPAT experiments, that, by 


definition, are needed to obtain what was called the final GEPAT solution (see the notes above 


on Iterating For The Remaining Partitionings), are, to a great deal, what can make GEPAT a 


computationally demanding technique. Nevertheless, recall once again, that, even for K-means, 


there is, usually, the need for additional experiments, and thus, for multiple runs of its basic 


algorithm, when investigating on the clustering nature of a dataset. That said, there seems to be 


some interest in somehow merging these two clustering techniques. One way to do so would be 


to use a GEPAT-type initialization process (steps 1: and 2: of the basic GEPAT algorithm) in 


substitution of the random initialization of clusters often used in K-means, and, from there, 


perform a K-means-style, hill-climbing iteration for a clustering solution. This would also 


mean that K would depend on the grading threshold T0, on SRP, and on the order chosen for 


the iteration sequence at step 2: of the basic GEPAT algorithm, instead of being a user-


specified parameter (with these characteristics, such a technique could still be called 


“empirical”). The final clustering solution for the dataset would then be secured following the 


GEPAT procedure established for that end. Basically, what is proposed with the merging of the 


two techniques substitutes steps 3: and 4: of the basic GEPAT algorithm by the basic K-means 


algorithm, which would, necessarily, increase the computational time requirements of the 


merged technique, relative to any of the two original ones (assuming that everything else 


remains unchanged). 


Other future developments of GEPAT can be anticipated. Some of which are concerned with: 


a) a study of the consequences of using a grading threshold at stage 3: of the basic GEPAT 


algorithm, a procedure that could potentially leave some of the patterns in the dataset out of the 


partitioning (this would make GEPAT go from being able to provide a complete clustering to 


being classified as [only] a partial clustering technique), and would, consequently, increase the 


values for the cluster evaluation measures CG and MG; b) making sure that the standard 


deviation information needed in the application of GEPAT's proximity measure to evaluate the 


DD measure is updated for the specific set of CPs being intercompared (see the discussion 


above at ? for DD); c) finding an objective way to deal with the empty clusters that may result 


from the RPing (CPing) methodology; d) reducing the time requirements of the operation of 


- 18 - 







the different GEPAT applications, e.g., by eliminating any redundancies in the process of 


changing the SRP in Iterating For The Remaining Partitionings towards the final GEPAT 


solution; e) refining the cluster validity measures, and their use in the estimation of the global 


index G. 


Again, along with the implementation of any of these ideas, careful testing needs to be 


performed, namely, on datasets with distinct clustering nature, and resorting to a thorough 


investigation of cluster validity on a sound statistical framework, with the goal to infer and 


attest GEPAT's robustness. 


12 Case studies 


Figure A.1 shows the result of applying GEPAT with a threshold T0 = 0 %, to the JJA 1998 


ISCCP observational record of TCC along the GPCI cross section. As previously mentioned, 


this particular use of GEPAT gives a final clustering solution corresponding to a single 


partition, associated with what was called the “best-liked” pattern (the RP shown in Fig. A.1). 


Recall also that, for the T0 = 0 % case, the CP obtained is no more than the seasonal mean TCC 


along the transect. Overall, the RP and CP found are similar, with the CP being a somewhat 


smoother version of the former. The RP presents more pronounced local extremes of TCC, 


namely, the higher values in the ITCZ (5°N to 8°N) and Sc (and beginning of the transition 


from Sc to ShCu, ~ 20°N), and lower values of TCC in the ShCu (14°N to 17°N), and to the 


south of the ITCZ.

Note that the slight differences between the CP shown in Fig. A.1 and the ISCCP mean 


seasonal TCC in Fig. 5.1 arise from the fact that, in preparation for GEPAT, additional 


screening was performed on the observational data as to eliminate records with bad values at 


any of the 13 positions in the cross section. 


In Table A.1, information is presented, pertaining to the dataset of ISCCP TCC, and values of 


associated GEPAT quantities, corresponding to the cluster analysis presented in Fig. A.1. 


Regarding the ISCCP data, the maximum number of good records (Maximum # of good 


records) and the number of good records found (# of good records found), indicate, 


respectively, the expected number of TCC patterns corresponding to a three-month-long (JJA) 


3-hourly record (720), and the actual number of good patterns that passed the GEPAT 


screening criteria as being adequate for the subsequent cluster analysis (563). For the cluster 


analysis itself, the table lists the following items: the value of the grading threshold applied (T0 


= 0 %); the record ID (in the 3-hourly seasonal sequence) of the starting reference pattern (SRP 


= 506); the size of the clustering (K = 1); the values for the four GEPAT measures of cluster 


validity MG, DD, SI, and SS (for the “best-liked” record found, MG is ~ 42.2 %, and, as 


expected, DD, SI, and SS, are equal to 0 %, 1, and 100 %, respectively); the final GEPAT 


evaluation, as seen in the value of the global index of clustering validity, G (~ 60.6 %); and 


finally, the bottom portion of the table with only a single line of entries, where, rec, refpat, 


patcnt, patrep %, and patgrd % stand for, record (ID = 506 [the SRP]), reference pattern (001 


indicates that the record has been used as a reference pattern), pattern count (also cluster count, 


Si = 563, i.e., all the [good] patterns in the dataset), pattern representativity (also cluster 


representativity, Si% = 100 %), and pattern grade (also cluster grade, CG ~ 42.2 %), 


respectively. This table is an example of output from the GEPAT software.

A GEPAT basic thresholding has been applied to the ISCCP TCC data as well. The respective 


results are shown in Fig. A.2. As mentioned above, the results of a basic thresholding offer a 


broad look at the characteristics of the (final) GEPAT solutions for different grading 


thresholds, namely in what concerns the values of the different measures of cluster validity 


used in the calculation of G, presented in the plot to the right. Apart from these numbers, the 


plot to the left shows the record ID of the SRP, and the size of the clustering (K) for each value 


of the grading threshold (as commented above, 563 is the total number of good ISCCP TCC 


patterns found). 


 


Figure A.2 - GEPAT basic thresholding with a 5 % threshold resolution applied to June-July-August 1998 ISCCP 
TCC data along GPCI: (left) Starting Reference Patterns’ ID (SRP), and size of the clusterings (K), and (right) 


four cluster validity measures (SS, DD, MG, SI), along with the values for the global index of clustering validity, 
G (see text for details). 


A striking feature of the results shown in Fig. A.2 is the variation of the SRPs corresponding to 


the final GEPAT solutions for the different grading thresholds. Recall that these solutions are 


already the outcome of the G Disambiguation procedure presented earlier, that, in the 


particular case of the saturation domain (see Tsat and the Saturation Domain), gives the 


clustering solution associated with the first (good) record of the season as the final GEPAT 


solution (1, for this dataset). In fact, ISCCP's Tsat is found to be 95 %, a conclusion reached 


from the values of K (563 at 95 % [562 at 90 %]) and SI (0 at 95 % [~0.002 at 90 %]). The 


behaviour of K and SI is noteworthy too. K increases monotonously, and particularly rapidly, 


between the 50 % (K = 94) and 80 % (K = 520) thresholds, while SI decreases monotonously, 


and particularly rapidly, between those same thresholds (SI ~ 0.93, and ~ 0.07, respectively, for 


T = 50 %, and T = 80 %). For the other measures of cluster validity: SS is 100 % for 0 %, and 


saturation domain thresholds, and has an absolute minimum of ~ 86 % at 25 %; DD is 0 % at 0 


% threshold (as expected), jumps to ~ 50 % at T = 5 %, and stays between ~ 66 % and ~ 70 %

between 40 % and 100 % thresholds, with a maximum ~ 69.8 % at T = 70 %, and a value of ~ 


66.8 % in the saturation domain; MG has a value of ~ 42.2 % at 0 % threshold (as discussed 


above [Table A.1 with T0 = 0 %, “best-liked-record”, results]), shows an absolute minimum of 


~ 33.5 % at 15 %, from where it grows almost linearly all the way to the 70 % threshold (~ 96 


%), and, as expected, approaches 100 % as the threshold approaches the saturation domain. 


Finally, the global index of clustering validity, G, is ~ 60,6 % at a 0 % threshold, has an 


absolute maximum of ~ 81 % at 50 %, from where it consistently decreases (owing to the sharp 


decrease in SI [recall Eq. A.6]) to a value of 50 % in the saturation domain. 


The investigation turns now to finding particular clusterings for the purpose of the 


intercomparison of cluster analysis results among a number of different JJA 1998 TCC 


datasets, namely, from observations, reanalysis, and model simulations. To accomplish that 


goal, the four steps presented above at Choosing A Particular Clustering (K0) were applied, in 


a first stage, to ISCCP TCC observations to find a clustering of a size reasonable for the 


qualitative intercomparison proposed in the context of this thesis. Assuming that any K 


between 3 and 8 would fit the objectives, the choice ended up being the clustering with K0 = 6, 


obtained for a grading threshold T0 = 23.6 % determined with the refined thresholding depicted 


in Fig. A.3. The other GEPAT quantities for this particular clustering are: a record ID = 207 for 


the corresponding SRP; the clustering validity measures MG, DD, SI, and SS, with values of ~ 


42.7 %, ~ 58.1 %, 1, and ~ 84.6 %, respectively; and a global index of clustering validity G ~ 


67.5 %.

Figure A.3 - GEPAT refined thresholding of ISCCP June-July-August 1998 TCC data along GPCI: (left) the 
particular threshold, T0 (23.6 %), and clustering, K0 (6) found (indicated by the red lines), and (right, along the 


vertical red line) the corresponding four cluster validity measures (SS, DD, MG, SI), along with the values for the 
global index of clustering validity, G (see text for details). 


Figure A.4 shows the RPs and CPs for the ISCCP (K0 = 6) clustering discussed in the previous 


paragraph. The numbers 031, 043, 207, 019, 380, and 009 indicate the record ID of the 


- 22 - 







respective RPs (recall that the SRP for this clustering was the record with ID = 207), and are 


ordered by decreasing cluster representativeness, Si%, ~ 29.5 %, ~ 28.2 %, ~ 27.2 %, ~ 6 %, ~ 


5.3 %, and ~ 3.7 %, respectively. Keep in mind that these Si% are the weights to be applied to 


each one of the respective CPs in the weighted average that gives the CP for the dataset as a 


whole (or equivalently, the CP for the clustering with T0 = 0 %), that, in this case, is the 


(traditional) seasonal mean TCC along the GPCI transect. 


 


Figure A.4 - GEPAT RPs, CPs, RPs’ record ID (numbers in bold), and grading threshold (Thresh.) corresponding 
to the K0 = 6 clustering depicted in Fig. A.3, obtained for ISCCP June-July-August 1998 TCC observations along 


GPCI. 


According to the basic GEPAT algorithm, the RPs shown in Fig. A.4 are the initial set of RPs 


formed using the 207 pattern as the SRP. These RPs are then the ones to which the patterns in 


the dataset are assigned based on the highest value of the proximity measure. This results in the 


formation of K clusters, whose respective CPs are the prototype patterns corresponding (in this 


version of GEPAT) to the centers of the clusters. With this in mind, the CPs are viewed, and 


used, in subsequent investigations of the TCC field as the sole representatives of the GEPAT 


clustering. In this context, it is pertinent to comment on a number of features of the CPs 


presented in Fig. A.4, also because ISCCP is the reference dataset for what follows in this, and 


the next section. Using the record ID as the reference for the plots, note that: in plot 031, the 


most representative CP highly resembles the CP for the dataset as a whole (Fig. A.1) in what 


concerns the evolution of the TCC field along the transect, with the main difference being an 


overall ~ 15 % higher TCC for all the locations south of 20°N (note also that the peak value in

the Sc regions is in 031 ~ 95 % [at 29°N]); 031 is the only plot for which the ITCZ shows a 


TCC plateau (5°N to 8°N), while the other CPs tend to show a single peak at 5°N, 8°N, or even 


11°N (probably associated with the northward shift of the ITCZ during the JJA season); plot 


031 shows a relatively smooth TCC transition, going from the peak at 29°N to a local 


minimum at 17°N; in 043 there is, relative to 031, a general decrease in TCC in all the 


positions south of 23°N, but a consistently high Sc TCC with a value of ~ 90 % all the way to 


23°N, south of which it rapidly decreases to ~ 30 % at 11°N, a much steeper transition than in 


031, associated with a single-peaked (5°N) well defined, but less prominent ITCZ (~ 70 %); 


relative to 043, the third most representative CP, shown in plot 207, essentially has Sc decks 


more confined to the north, still a relatively steep transition going from the Sc to the ShCu, but 


higher transect minimum values of TCC (~ 40 % at 14°N and south of the ITCZ); in plot 019 a 


relatively important TCC peak (~ 75 %) in the ITCZ (8°N) is contrasted by a relatively flat Sc-


to-ShCu TCC transition between, 29°N and 17°N (~ 70 % at 29°N, ~ 60 % at 20°N, and ~ 50 


% at 17°N), although showing a ~ 80 % peak TCC in the Sc region, at 32°N (remember 019's 


relatively low Si% ~ 6 %); for the least representative CPs in plots 380 and 009, the TCC is 


below 70 % in all the transect locations, the local peak associated with the ITCZ (at 11°N in 


both CPs) is quite low (~ 55 % in 380, and below 40 % in 009), and lower than the peak values 


of TCC in the Sc; finally, note in 009, that its very shy ITCZ is associated with a relatively 


consistent Sc deck, all the way to a peak just below ~ 65 % at 26°N, south of which the TCC 


transitions relatively smoothly, with a rate similar to that in plot 031, to an absolute minimum 


of ~ 25 % at 14°N. 


Figure A.5 is the equivalent of Fig. A.4, but for ERA-40 TCC reanalysis data. As mentioned in 


Choosing A Particular Clustering (K0), after the determination of K0 for the reference dataset, 


K0 is used as a fixed parameter during the search for a clustering of the same size for the 


remaining datasets of interest (recall that, for ISCCP, the K0 determined [Fig. A.3] is equal to 


6). For ERA-40, a K0 = 6 corresponds to a T0 = 24 %. Again, the CPs shown are identified 


using the respective RPs’ record ID and are ordered by decreasing cluster representativeness, 


Si%, ~ 22.1 %, ~ 20.8 %, ~ 19.9 %, ~ 18.8 %, 12.5 %, and ~ 6 %, respectively for 027, 169, 


694, 047, 541, and 001. 


A first note on the ERA-40 results concerns the distribution of Si% among the different 


clusters. It is somewhat more uniform than in the ISCCP clustering, with a lower maximum 


value, and a value below 10 %, only for the least representative cluster. Compared to the CPs 


for ISCCP, ERA-40’s CPs depict, overall, a significantly more prominent ITCZ, and a less 


- 24 - 







notorious decrease in TCC in the transition from the Sc to the ShCu regions. These two aspects 


are in line with the TCC field descriptions provided in Figs. 5.1 and 5.2. Keeping these 


idiosyncratic divergences in mind, there seems to be, however, an analogous general behaviour 


of the TCC fields when going from the CP with the highest Si% to the next two CPs in the 


sequence, namely, a lowering of the TCC in the transect regions characterized by the lowest 


TCCs (14°N to 20°N in the ShCu, and south of the ITCZ). Also, the TCC transition looks 


flatter in the third CP (694) than in the second CP (169), specially between 32°N and 20°N. 


Among the CPs with Si% above 15 %, 047 (Si% ~ 18.8 %) is the one that shows the most 


pronounced decrease in TCC in the transition regions, particularly between 26°N (where the Sc 


peak at ~ 80 % TCC) and 14°N (~ 40 % TCC). The CP in plot 541, shows the lowest TCC 


values for the two extreme north locations (~ 35 % and ~ 45 %, at 35°N and 32°N, 


respectively), a situation that would correspond to a later development (in a Lagrangian sense) 


of the Sc decks, farther away from the coast of California (this happens 12.5 % of the time 


during the JJA 1998 season [as inferred from the corresponding Si%]). In the least 


representative CP, the ITCZ’s signature is barely distinct, with a broad area (2°N to 11°N) of 


TCC values between 60 % and 70 %, below those in the Sc regions (this is similar to the 


situation in the two ISCCP CPs with the lowest Si%). Finally, there seems to be (as for ISCCP) 


a tendency for the ITCZ to show a single, more outstanding, TCC peak for the less 


representative CPs, as opposed to showing two relatively close TCC values at 5°N and 8°N.

To conclude the analysis, it is imperative to present a close comparison of the values for T0, 


SRP, and the measures of cluster validity between the two GEPAT solutions discussed above. 


The two K0 = 6 clusterings, for ISCCP, and for ERA-40, compare as follows (in respective 


order): T0 is 23.6 % and 24 %; SRPs' record ID are 207 and 694; MG is ~ 42.7 % and ~ 42.1 


%, DD is ~ 58.1 % and ~ 47.9 %; SI is 1 for both; SS is ~ 84.6 % and 93.5 %; and G is ~ 67.5 


% and ~ 69.2 %. Given the higher G, ERA-40’s TCC data for JJA 1998 can, in this context, be 


said to cluster better around the respective (K0 = 6) CPs than ISCCP. Note that choosing in Fig. 


A.3, the clustering for T0 = 23.4, and K0 = 7, would increase ISCCP’s G to ~ 69.3 %. 


The search for a particular clustering of size K0 = 6 was also performed on 3-hourly JJA 1998 


TCC simulated by the GPCI models. The results for a few of the models are presented in Fig. 


A.6, with the CPs, and in Table A.2, with the corresponding T0, Si% distribution, MG measure, 


and the global index G. Regarding Si%, among the eight models shown, the value for the most 


representative CP is below 26 %, and the lowest value for the least representative CP (CP6 in 


Table A.2, typically above 8 %) is ~2 %. In terms of the MG validity measure, the lowest value 


belongs to NCAR (~ 40 %) and the highest value to JAMSTEC (~ 49 %). The global index of 


clustering validity, G, is between Météo-France's ~ 70.1 % and JAMSTEC's ~ 73.3 %. The 


results correspond to clusterings obtained from a refined GEPAT thresholding, whose final 


choices have, among these models, T0 values ranging from 23 % (Météo-France) to 31 % 


(NCEP). Note that for ETH/MPI the clustering shown has a K0 of only 5, since none of the 


refined thresholding attempts yielded a clustering with 6 clusters.

Table A.2 - CP representativeness (Si%), mean CP grade (MG), global index of clustering validity (G), and 
grading threshold (T0) for (K0 = 6) GEPAT clusterings obtained for June-July-August 1998 TCC along GPCI 


simulated by eight of the participating models. 


The high TCC scatter seen in Fig. A.6 in all of the locations along the GPCI cross section, and 


for any of the six CPs, is reminiscent of the situation in Fig. 5.1, for the seasonal mean TCC. 


Qualitatively, CP1 seems to be the CP for which the scatter is, overall, lower, specially 


- 26 - 







between 23°N and 29°N (peak TCC values in the Sc regions), and at 8°N (ITCZ). Moreover, in 


CP1, apart from the differences in the TCC values in the deep convection region, an additional 


factor contributing to the scatter between 2°N and 14°N is the discrepancy in the location of 


the ITCZ among the different models, a situation less pronounced in the next 3 CPs (specially 


in CPs 2 and 4). CPs 2 to 4 show a better colocation in what regards the ITCZ, although with a 


higher range in the peak TCC, as compared with CP1. In general, and more so in the first three 


CPs, the models show the typical features found in the seasonal mean TCC field, namely, 


higher TCC values in the ITCZ and Sc, and lower TCCs in the ShCu and south of the ITCZ 


(Météo-France, and to some extent NCAR, are the only models that consistently show this 


behaviour in all of the six CPs). The main differences among the CPs are then mostly related 


with the relative magnitudes of the TCC compared between each one of those regions, as well 


as the characteristics of the Sc-to-ShCu transition. Note, though, that there is no significant 


agreement among the models in terms of TCC changes going from the most to the least 


representative CPs. 


 


Figure A.6 - For eight of the participating models, GEPAT CPs corresponding to a particular clustering of size K0 
= 6 obtained for June-July-August 1998 TCC simulated along GPCI. 


Individually, the models show some remarkable differences among the respective set of CPs. 


For the sake of brevity only a few of the models are highlighted here. In the case of the UKMO 


model: it shows in both CP1 and CP2 an ITCZ with lower TCC (~ 50 %) than in the respective 


Sc areas (~ 90 %), but in the most representative one (CP1) a much more abrupt, and later

(more to the south), decrease in TCC between the Sc and the ShCu; in CPs 4 and 5, the ITCZ 


TCC lowers to ~ 40 %, with the absolute maximum TCC peak in the transect moving south to 


23°N in CP5; the highest ITCZ TCC value (~ 72 %) is actually found in CP6 (Si% ~ 5 %), 


associated with a broad area of relatively high TCC around the deep convection region (note 


also that the local minimum associated with the ShCu is located between 23°N and 26°N, 


farther north than in the seasonal mean [~ 14°N]). For the NCAR model: it shows higher TCC 


in the Sc than in the ITCZ in three of the CPs (CPs 1, 3, and 4, with ~ 58 % combined Si%), 


and higher TCC in the ITCZ than in the Sc in two other CPs (CPs 2, and 5, with ~ 34 % 


combined Si%), CP6 (Si% ~ 8.5 %) shows similar TCC values (~ 80 %) in both the ITCZ and 


Sc; smoother and less pronounced Sc-to-ShCu TCC decreases are found in the two CPs with 


the highest ITCZ TCCs (specially in CP5). In the seasonal mean in Fig. 5.1, the model from 


JAMSTEC shows: no apparent ITCZ peak, an absolute transect maximum of ~ 80 % TCC at 


17°N, and Sc TCC between ~ 45 % at 35°N, and ~ 70 % at 26°N. JAMSTEC's clustering in 


Fig. A.6 shows: a broad area of consistently high TCC to the north of 5°N in both CP1 and 


CP6; in CPs 2 and 4, it has, comparatively, a not as wide area of relatively high TCC (higher in 


CP4 than in CP2), confined between 14°N and, 29°N in CP2, and 26°N in CP4; and a 


prominent TCC peak (~ 90 %) centered at 17°N in CPs 3 and 5, and notoriously isolated in 


CP5 (Si% ~ 12 %). Finally, for NCEP (the model with the second highest MG ~ 48.7 %): it is 


very clear that there are big differences among the six CPs; disregarding the northernmost two 


positions in the section, there is, for CP1 (Si% ~ 22 %), a strikingly good agreement with the 


seasonal mean ISCCP TCC shown in Fig. 5.1; CP3 is the one that most closely resembles the 


model’s seasonal mean TCC in Fig. 5.1 (though showing a lower ShCu minimum ~ 10 % at 


14°N, also the lowest among any of the CPs); CP2 (Si% ~ 21 %) is unique in the sense that, 


together with the highest of all ITCZ TCC peak values (slightly above 70 %), it presents, 


overall, the lowest TCC for the ShCu and Sc regions (17°N to 35°N) with a peak of ~ 25 % at 


23°N (the only southward decrease in TCC in this area is found between 20°N and 17°N); CPs 


4 and 5 (~ 28 % combined Si%), in contrast, have very low values of TCC in the deep 


convection area (&amp;lt;30 %) accompanied with peaks of high TCC in the subtropics (~ 80 %); 


finally, CP6's broad area of relatively high TCC, between 5°N and 23°N, is a feature similar to 


the one described for UKMO's CP6, although shifted north relative to the later by ~ 6° (note 


that NCEP's CP6 is ~ 2.5 times more representative than UKMO's CP6). 


One important conclusion of the analysis presented in the previous paragraphs is that GEPAT 


seems useful in the identification of clusters of patterns in the TCC data investigated. These 


- 28 - 







patterns can be used as the basis for subsequent compositing of the model simulation results, 


with the goal of better understanding underlying model deficiencies. Models, such as those 


from JAMSTEC and NCEP analyzed above, would, potentially, benefit from such an 


approach, that could also be applied in finding any compensating errors in models that score 


well in terms of the (e.g., seasonal) mean fields. 


Finally, a closing remark on these results to stress that, only from the analysis of basic 


thresholding results it is possible to have a first notion on which grading threshold would offer 


the best GEPAT clustering for a given dataset. What is shown in Fig. A.6, and in Table A.2, 


correspond to a request for a clustering of a very specific size K0 = 6, which may not 


necessarily be the ideal K0 for any of those datasets. 


With the goal to more directly compare the clustering structure of the ERA-40 TCC dataset 


with the one obtained for ISCCP, a outsourced conventional GEPAT RPing experiment was 


performed on the ERA-40 TCC, using, as a reference, the set of RPs from the particular K0 = 6 


clustering from ISCCP analyzed above. The corresponding results are shown in Fig. A.7, and 


are analyzed below resorting to a qualitative comparison of the respective clustering validity 


measures (specifically MG and G), and cluster representativeness distribution (Si%). Recall 


that no grading threshold is involved in RPing (a kind of “forced” cluster partitioning, as 


mentioned previously).

of the cloud regimes (and respective cloud transitions) that occur during the JJA season in the 


ith respect to the order of the cluster representativeness (Si%), note that, except for th


swap between RPs 019 and 043, respectively from fourth place to second pla


vice versa), all the other ISCCP RPs maintained their relative positions in the sequence of 


decreasing Si%. Specifically, the numbers for ERA-40 CPs’ Si% are now ~ 31.5 %, ~ 28.8 %, ~ 


17.4 %, ~ 14.4 %, ~ 6 %, and ~ 1.9 %, respectively, for the CPs associated with the ISCCP 


RPs with record IDs 031, 019, 207, 043, 380, and 009 (the numbers for ISCCP, and for the 


“unforced” ERA-40 clustering are given above, in the discussion of Figs. A.4 and A.5, 


respectively). 


In what concerns the CPs, although between this clustering and the “unforced” one in Fig. A.5 


the two most r


respective fourth clusters, although to a lesser extent), important departures characterize the 


remaining clusters as (respectively) compared to each other. In fact, the numbers for MG and G 


show that this RPing result corresponds to a slightly poorer clustering, as compared with the 


“unforced” ERA-40 clustering (MGs of ~ 40 % and ~ 42.1 %, and Gs of ~ 62.4 % and ~ 69.2 


%, respectively), or with the ISCCP reference clustering (MG ~ 42.7 %, and G ~ 67.5 %). 


Finally, there seems to be, overall, a better agreement between the ERA-40 clusterings 


(“forced” and “unforced”), than between the ERA-40 clustering that resulted from the RPing 


and the ISCCP clustering that was used as the source of the RPs that initialized the RPing. 


Three concluding points before proceeding to the next section: i) in the future, the CPs 


representing the clusterings will show “error bars” indicating the magnitude of the stand


deviations of each one of the (vectorial) components of the patterns that belong to the 


respective clusters; ii) the development of a more quantitative comparison between a clustering 


resulting from RPing and the reference clustering will be pondered; and iii) it would be 


interesting to obtain, separately for each cluster in a given clustering, the TCC histograms 


produced for Fig. 5.2. 


The m in goal here is to describe the environmental conditions associated with distinct features 


tropical and subtropical NE Pacific ocean. A first step would have to do with the search for 


preferred spatiotemporal modes in the behaviour of the TCC field along the GPCI cross 


- 30 - 







section. It was suggested that such investigation on the behaviour of the TCC field could be 


performed resorting to a clustering methodology. The decision to follow this kind of approach 


led to the development of a novel cluster analysis technique (GEPAT), whose preliminary 


results, discussed in the previous sections, seem adequate for the accomplishment of that goal. 


It is in this context that ERA-40-versus-ISCCP GEPAT RPing results for TCC are used for the 


compositing of key dynamical and thermodynamical variables believed to have an important 


role in the maintenance and evolution of the cloud phenomenology in the GPCI region. The 


analysis that follows tries to qualitatively infer potential impacts of the interplay of those key 


parameters, on the regime transitions that, generally, occur in maritime regions adjacent to the 


eastern boundaries of the subtropical oceans. 


The nonavailability of crucial observations (e.g., vertical velocity) on the 3-hourly temporal 


resolution needed for the study, is the main justification for the alternative use of reanalysis 


path (LWP), sea surface temperature (SST), and low tropospheric 


data. Nevertheless, it was still tried to have some purely observational input, by resorting to 


clustering results from the GEPAT RPing of ERA-40 TCC based on RPs from ISCCP (the 


same RPing discussed in the previous section and shown in Fig. A.7). The corresponding set of 


ERA-40 CPs, and associated cluster partitioning, was used to guide the compositing of the 


other ERA-40 variables. 


Figure A.8 shows ERA-40 JJA 1998 seasonal mean fields of vertical velocity at 700 hPa 


(W700mb), liquid water 


stability (LTS) along the GPCI transect, together with section-averaged wind direction (direc) 


and speed. In each one of the six top panels shown, the means were calculated from data 


composited, respectively, for each one of the six clustering partitions of corresponding ERA-40 


TCC data, that resulted from the RPing experiment presented in Fig. A.7 (based on a K0 = 6 


ISCCP clustering). Note that, as in Fig. A.7, the plots in Fig. A.8 are ordered left-to-right and 


top-to-bottom by decreasing cluster representativeness (Si%). Additionally, the bottom plot in 


Fig. A.8, shows the means for the season as a whole, included for reference. Note that the Si% 


values are the same ones presented earlier in the discussion of Fig. A.7 (recall that these Si% 


are the weights to be applied to each one of the respective composited means in the weighted 


average that gives the traditional seasonal mean results shown in the bottom plot). Using the 


CPs presented in Fig. A.7 as a starting point, a comparative approach is adopted in the analysis 


of the composited results shown in Fig. A.8. The goal is to characterize how the associated 


environmental factors change going from one TCC CP to the next. 


- 31 - 







There are two main differences between the TCC CPs in plots 031 and 019 (Fig. A.7). One is 


the much lower TCC to the south of the ITCZ in 019 (at -1°N and 2°N), and the other is the 


departure in TCC in all points between 14°N and 35°N (ShCu and Sc), with values in the range 


of ~ 50 % to ~ 60 % in 019 (with a broad area of practically uniform TCC [~ 60 %] between 


20°N and 32°N), and ~ 55 % to ~ 75 % in 031. Note that the ITCZs peak at ~ 90 % in both 


plots.

intense upward motion in the deep convection area, higher subsidence to the south of the 


ITCZ, and a more uniform subsidence field between 14°N and 29°N. Regarding the LTS, 019 


shows slightly higher values at -1°N and 35°N, but 031 has higher values in all positions 


between 14°N and 32°N. Comparing now the TCC CPs in plots 031 and 207, there are in 207 


lower TCC values in the entire cross section (ITCZ peak ~ 72 %, versus ~ 90 % in 031), except 


in the three northernmost points (Sc), where it is higher, with values close to 80 %, this implies 


a much steeper Sc-to-ShCu TCC decrease. In the respective plots in Fig. A.8, the wind is more 


intense, and slightly more to the south, in 207, the LWP in 207 is much lower in the ITCZ, 


higher to the north of it, until 23°N, and presents similar values to those in 031 between 26°N 


and 35°N. The much less intense upward motion in the ITCZ in 207 is accompanied with 


overall slightly higher, and more uniform, subsidence between 17°N and 26°N, but lower 


subsidence between 29°N and 35°N. Finally, though showing, to the most part, similar SSTs 


and LTSs, the LTS is slightly higher at 35°N in 207. 


To conclude the analysis, 019 is, in a broad sense, the panel in Fig. A.8 whose results most 


esting to: i) analyze the 


resemble the results shown in the bottom panel with the seasonal means. Interestingly, a high 


degree of similitude is also found between the corresponding TCC CP in Fig. A.7 and the 


ERA-40 mean TCC in Fig. 5.1 (except for the southernmost and northernmost points in the 


transect). One interpretation for this could be that, the insight offered by the (traditional) 


seasonal mean is somewhat limited in the sense that, in this particular case, it represents the 


view obtained from only ~ 29 % of the dataset records during the JJA 1998 season (deduced 


from the GEPAT representativeness of the respective TCC CP [019]). 


In a future development of the work presented above it would be inter


same kind of results obtained for each one of the GPCI models; ii) extend the analysis to other 


seasons (separately or in combination), and include more years; iii) compare the results 


obtained for (cross sections in) different regions (e.g., the five subtropical maritime stratus 


regions identified in Klein and Hartmann [1993]), and for all such regions combined; iv) get 


the RPs (or the CPs) for a particular (K0) clustering of the (e.g., cloud cover) data 


corresponding to all the regions combined and perform subsequent RPing (or alternatively 


CPing) experiments using those same RPs (CPs) but for each region individually (e.g., for the 


same time period used to get the reference RPs [CPs]), and compare the resulting Si% PDFs for 


each region; v) if what is proposed in iv) is performed with a tight constraint on the grading 


threshold for the pattern assignment stage of the RPing (CPing) experiments (imposing this 


kind of constraint has not yet been tried, but is mentioned in Future Developments), a 


- 34 - 







comparison among the various regions, of compositing results of the kind of those discussed 


above (Fig. A.8) could be done with added confidence; vi) extend the analysis to the broader 


regions that encompass the cross sections; and finally, vii) use (more directly) purely 


observational data for as many variables as possible.

 American Meteorological Society Copyright Policy 
 
 (Accepted by the AMS Council 22 September 2010) 
 
The American Meteorological Society’s (AMS) mission to disseminate knowledge in the 
atmospheric and related oceanic and hydrologic sciences is best served by promoting wide 
access to AMS publications while ensuring that this dissemination preserves the integrity of the 
originally published works. The copyright to the materials published in AMS journals, 
monographs, and other publications is transferred from the author of the works to the AMS at the 
time it is accepted for publication allowing the AMS to act as the steward for the intellectual 
property contained in the published works. It also allows the AMS to protect the value of the 
materials in order to generate revenue for the AMS to support the peer-review publication 
process so crucial to the scholarly scientific endeavor. 
 
1. General Copyright Information 
 
The recipient of an AMS copyrighted work is not free to copy it and distribute the copy without 
obtaining prior permission from the AMS. This concept has been the foundation of copyright 
protection and continues to be the basic assumption of this policy. In addition, this policy 
repeatedly refers to two additional basic assumptions. 
 


1) Transmitting an AMS copyrighted work through a computer network is a form of 
copying. 


2) The AMS permits the use of links as a form of citation to its works. 
 
This policy (and other related statements) will be reviewed from time to time and amended or 
revised as necessary based on the experiences gained under its use and/or changes in the law. 
The AMS Publications Commission plays a key role in helping to formulate AMS’s copyright 
policies. The AMS Council, however, must approve all such policies. This document supersedes 
all previous AMS copyright policies and any related statements. 
 
2. Copyright notice 
 
The AMS requires that any republication of an AMS copyrighted work contain a copyright 
notice.  The AMS copyright notice must be displayed on the first page of any AMS copyrighted 
work that is published in print or on the first screen of a digitized work (such as a website). It is 
acceptable to place the string “© Copyright [date of publication] AMS” as a hypertext link to the 
full copyright notice.

3. Requirement for copyright transfer 
 
As a condition of publishing a work with the AMS, an author must transfer copyright to the work 
to the AMS. This requirement may be waived for some materials. The copyright transfer 
(referred to as the assignment of copyright) becomes effective when an AMS editor or 
appropriate AMS staff member accepts the work for publication. 
 
Once assignment of the copyright to AMS has occurred, authors must incorporate the AMS 
copyright notice (see section 2) into any copy of the work made available to others. The AMS 
will maintain the accepted version as the definitive version of the published work, as amended 
through editorial processing for publication. In the event that the AMS makes the published work 
available electronically, authors who maintain personal electronic collections should implant a 
link to the definitive version maintained by the AMS and should distribute only links pointing to 
the AMS definitive version. 
 
The copyright transfer forms are available on the AMS Web site  (http://www.ametsoc.org/) on 
the “Authors’ Resource Center” pages.  There are several different copyright transfer forms.  
Nearly all authors will use one of the “standard” copyright forms, and most will use the form that 
provides for the transfer of copyright to the AMS by the author(s).  A separate form provides for 
authors to sign a statement that the work was created as part of their official duties as a United 
States government employee and is therefore precluded from copyright protection.  An 
additional form is available on the AMS Web site for works subject to Crown Copyright.  A 
number of government laboratories have special copyright policies for contractors who work at 
those laboratories, and the Authors’ Resource Center Web site contains a set of forms specific to 
each of those laboratories. 
 
All authors must sign the appropriate copyright transfer form or statement that the work was 
created as part of the author’s duty as a United States Government employee or at the direction 
or control of any government department of any country. If there is more than one author of a 
work, all authors must sign an appropriate form.   It is not sufficient for one author to sign on 
behalf of coauthors.  Coauthors may all sign the same form or each sign a separate form.  
 
The AMS and many other publishers have a policy that authors submit a work for consideration 
for publication to only one editor at a time. The authors must notify editors if a work is identical 
to or substantially the same as a work submitted to another publisher.

4. Permission for use of copyrighted works of others 
 
An author who uses the material of another author or copyright owner, such as a graphical 
image, text, etc., is expected to obtain written permission from that author or copyright owner to 
include the material in the author’s work and provide a copy of that permission to the AMS.  The 
permission must be broad enough to permit the AMS to distribute the material as contained in 
the work in any and all media now known or later developed.  A sample permission form is 
available on the AMS website in the Authors’ Resource Center on the same page as the 
copyright transfer forms. Note that some copyright holders provide a “blanket permission” 
similar to that of the AMS that allows use of figures, tables, and brief excerpts without written 
permission (see section 2).  No additional action is required of authors who make use of 
materials that fall under such blanket permission. 
 
5. Citation to AMS works using links 
 
The AMS permits citations to its works through the use of links, and encourages the widespread 
distribution of links to the definitive versions of AMS copyrighted works and does not require 
that authors obtain prior permission to include such links in their new works. Execution of a link 
to view a work is considered permissible under these policies. Redistributing a copy created by 
the execution of a link, however, requires permission from the AMS. In addition, entities or 
individuals may not upload copies of AMS copyrighted works to a server for distribution by 
links without the permission of the AMS.  
 
The AMS considers it to be an infringement of its copyright if a series of links forms a pattern 
equivalent to the table of contents to an AMS publication or creates a compilation of AMS 
copyrighted works. To avoid misunderstandings, individuals should consult with the AMS 
before duplicating a substantial portion of an AMS copyrighted work with links. 
 
6. Definitive copy of a work and Early Online Releases (EORs) 
 
The AMS, in its role as steward, is obligated to ensure the work is permanently archived so that 
the published research record will always be available to future generations.  This stewardship 
role requires that the AMS maintain the definitive published version of any work published in an 
AMS journal and give permission to copy only true representations of that definitive version. 
The definitive version is defined as the version that has been accepted by an editor, 
professionally edited, and provided to the community as the final published form in print and/or 
electronic form in one or more formats that can be used to render the content. 
 
In seeking to provide new research results to the research community as quickly as possible, the 
AMS provides limited access to an Early Online Release (EOR) of an accepted manuscript for 
the period in which the accepted manuscript is being prepared for publication.  As soon as the 
definitive published version is available, it replaces the EOR version so that only the definitive 
work can be accessed from that point forward.  EORs are not intended to be used as 
replacements for the definitive published versions and, therefore, permission cannot be provided 
to post these almost-final versions on any non-AMS database or web site.

7. Distribution from non-AMS database or web site 
 
Copies of an AMS copyrighted work may not be placed on a non-AMS database or web site 
without permission from the AMS unless provided for under this policy. 
 
a. Distribution prior to submission 
 
The posting of a draft manuscript on Internet servers, such as an “e-print server” or the author’s 
home page, provides an opportunity for increased communication among researchers.  The AMS 
does not want to inhibit this avenue of scientific exchange. At the present time, and as long as 
certain requirements are met, the AMS treats such postings as informal publication and will not 
reject a manuscript that has been posted in this way on the basis of prior publication. 
 
The AMS strongly recommends that authors choosing to post their work prior to submission post 
with it a notice similar to the one shown below. 
 


Sample of Notice 
 


This document is provided by the contributing author(s) as a means to ensure timely 
dissemination of scholarly and technical work on a noncommercial basis. Copyright and 
all rights therein are maintained by the author(s) or by other copyright owners. It is 
understood that all persons copying this information will adhere to the terms and 
constraints invoked by each author's copyright. This work may not be reposted without 
explicit permission of the copyright owner. 


 
b. Distribution after submission but prior to editorial decision 
 
An author who submits a work for consideration by an AMS editor should include the following 
notice on any copy of the work posted by the author: 
 


This work has been submitted for publication. Copyright in this work may be transferred 
without further notice, and this version may no longer be accessible. 


 
c. Distribution after editorial decision 
 
For a work that was posted prior to the transfer of copyright to the AMS, permission is granted 
under this policy for the work to remain available online until publication by the AMS provided 
the following notice is included at the time the copyright assigned to the AMS: 
 


Permission to place a copy of this work on this server has been provided by the AMS.  The 
AMS does not guarantee that the copy provided here is an accurate copy of the published 
work. 


 
An author shall remove the work no later than the first of the month following the issue of the 
AMS publication containing the work.  Once the definitive version of the work is published by 







 
September 2010 Page 5 


the AMS, entities or individuals operating databases of web sites may replace the removed copy 
of the work, at the discretion of the server operators, with an abstract from and/or a summary of 
the work, along with a full citation to the AMS publication that can contain a link to the 
definitive copy of the work that resides on the AMS server. 
 
d. Open access institutional repositories 
 
The AMS understands there is increasing demand for institutions to provide open access to the 
published research being produced by employees, such as faculty, of that institution.  In 
recognition of this, the AMS grants permission to each of its authors to deposit the definitive 
version of that author’s published AMS journal article in the repository of the author’s institution 
provided all of the following conditions are met: 
 


? The article lists the institution hosting the repository as the author’s affiliation. 
? The copy provided to the repository is the final published PDF of the article (not the EOR 


version made available by AMS prior to formal publication; see section 6).  
? The repository does not provide access to the article until six months after the date of 


publication of the definitive version by the AMS. 
? The repository copy includes the AMS copyright notice. 


 
8. Permissions granted to its authors by the AMS 
 
The AMS grants its authors the following permissions: 
 


? Permission to reuse any portion of the author’s work, without a fee, in future lectures, 
press releases, or works of the author's own, provided that the AMS citation and notice of 
the AMS copyright are included. 


? Permission to post a copy of the work on the author's personal homepage (that is, a Web 
page under the direct control of the author) on a non-AMS server for noncommercial 
distributions, provided the AMS copyright notice (see section 2) is attached to the 
personal copy and that it represents the definitive copy (see section 6). 


? Permission to have the work posted on open access institutional repositories under the 
conditions provided in section 7d.  


? Permission for the author’s employer to distribute copies of the work to other employees 
within the organization. 


 
The assignment of copyright to the AMS does not affect the right of the author to seek patent 
protection for any invention that may be disclosed in the work.   
 
9. Republication 
 
The AMS maintains a policy of not republishing works, whether copyrighted by the AMS or by 
others, except under limited conditions where an editor determines there is significant benefit in 
republication.

10. Edited collections 
 
In most cases of conference proceedings and some other forms of collection, the collection as a 
whole is copyrighted by the AMS, while the authors may hold copyright to the individual 
components of the collection. 
 
No collection in which the AMS is the sole or joint copyright holder may be posted for open 
distribution without prior permission from the AMS. Notice of permission must accompany the 
AMS copyright notice. 
 
11. Permissions 
 
All AMS journals and monograph publications are registered with the Copyright Clearance 
Center (CCC) 222 Rosewood Drive, Danvers, MA 01923. The CCC provides an easy and 
effective means of obtaining permission for most uses of AMS copyrighted materials for a 
modest fee. The AMS encourages use of the CCC for permission processing whenever possible. 
Requests for permission to use AMS copyrighted works can also be directed to the Director of 
Publications at AMS Headquarters, 45 Beacon Street, Boston, MA 02108-3693; fax: 617-742-
8718; e-mail: copyright@ametsoc.org. 
 
12. Interpretation of coverage 
 
The AMS copyright transfer form grants the AMS all rights in the work, including, without 
limitation, the right to publish the work in whole or in part in any and all media now known or 
later developed.
