ABSTRACT 
  
Multicentric lymphoma was diagnosed in a two-year-old dog with respiratory distress, dysorexia, 
abdominal enlargement and generalized lymphadenopathy. Immunohistochemical examination showed T-
cell origin with CD3+ e CD79- expression. After five weeks, progressive neurological deficits and 
neoplastic lymphocytes were identified in the cerebrospinal fluid. Histopathological examination showed 
neoplastic cell invasion in the spleen, lymph nodes, cerebrum and cerebellum.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Lymphoma or lymphosarcoma is one of the most 
common neoplasms of the hematopoietic system, 
and account for approximately 7% to 24% off all 
canine neoplasia. (Vail et al., 2001; Rallis et al., 
1992). The classification can be made on the 
basis of anatomic location and histological 
criteria. The most common anatomic forms of 
lymphoma include the multicentric, cranial 
mediastinal, gastrointestinal, and cutaneous. 
Primary extranodal forms such as those 
occurring in the central nervous system (CNS), 

eyes, bone, testes, and nasal cavity are less 
commonly observed (Vail et al., 2001; Sequeira 
et al., 1999). This paper describes a multicentric 
lymphoma with metastasis in the CNS. 
 
 

CASE REPORT 
 
A two-year-old, female Labrador retriever was 
presented with a history of lethargy, respiratory 
distress, dysorexia, abdominal enlargement with 
20 days of evolution. Physical examination 
revealed generalized lymphadenopathy, mucous

membrane pallor, hepatomegaly and 
splenomegaly and muffled heart and lung 
sounds.  
 
Hematological examination showed normocytic 
normochromic anemia and leukocyte and platelet 
counts within the reference range (Jain, 1993). 
Serum biochemical analysis showed elevated 
serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) and ?-glutamyl transferase 
(GGT) activities and a decrease in total serum 
protein and albumin. Urinalysis and creatinine, 
urea and calcium serum levels were normal. 
Hepatosplenomegaly, pleural effusion and a 
cranial mediastinal mass were evident on 
abdominal and thoracic radiographs, 
respectively. Lymph node cytology was 
diagnostic for lymphocytic lymphoma. The 
immunophenotype of the tumor showed T-cell 
origin with CD3+ e CD 79- expression. 
Immunohistochemistry techniques were 
developed in Immunohistochemical Laboratory 
of the Pathology Service in UNESP. It was used 
the immunoperoxidase techniques, in agreement 
with Hsu (1981), using lymphoid anti-CD3 
marker (Dako A0452), a polyclonal antibody, for 
T-cells and anti-CD79a (Dako M7051) marker, a 
monoclonal antibody, and for B-cells (Moura et 
al., 2001). 
 
Treatment with systemic chemotherapy was 
initiated in an attempt to induce remission using 
cyclophosphamide1, vincristine2 and prednisone3 
(COP) in doses recommended in the literature 
(Vail et al., 2001). Besides, nutritional 
management was established to provide specific 
oncology nutritional support and to reduce 
toxicity associated with chemotherapy (Ogilvie, 
1998). Diet with low levels of simple 
carbohydrates and moderate levels of high-
quality protein, fiber and fat was established. 
 
In the course of five weeks, the dog was healthy, 
except after chemotherapy administration, when 
it presented vomiting and anorexia during one or 
two days. A complete blood count was 
performed periodically to control drugs side 
effects, as myelotoxicity. Antibiotics and 
immunomodulatory drugs were given when 
necessary.

After the fifth week, the dog had signs of head 
tremoring (partial seizure), anorexia, lethargy 
and vomiting. Results of routine hematological, 
urinalysis and blood gas analysis showed normal 
values. The biochemical analysis revealed 
hypocalemia. Symptomatic and support 
treatment was accomplished. The dog was 
treated with fluid therapy (Ringer’s solution) 
added with KCl 19.1%. Metoclopramide and 
ranitidine were administered for vomiting control 
and ampicilin for prevention of systemic 
infections.  
 
Despite the treatment, the clinical signs of the 
dog continued to get worse. After two days, 
neurological examination showed progressive 
neurological deficits, hyperesthesia, ataxia 
followed by tetraplegic, intention tremors, 
behavioral changes (depression), hyperreflexia 
and horizontal nistagmus with the last phase to 
the right. Cranial nerve examination was 
abnormal with hyposmia, menace reaction and 
facial reflex decreased. An ophthalmic 
examination was performed and did not reveal 
any abnormalities. 
 
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected from the 
cerebellomedullary cistern. CSF analysis 
revealed elevated nucleated cell count and 
protein concentration. Cytological examination 
revealed a population of lymphoid cells with 
marked anisocytosis and anisokaryosis, evident 
nucleoli, basophilic cytoplasm and atypical 
mitotic figures (Fig. 1). 
 
The previous chemotherapy was suspended and a 
lomustine1 (CCNU) protocol was established in 
agreement with the literature (Fan and Kitchell, 
2000). Because of the rapid course of the disease, 
the poor prognosis and worsening of the clinics 
signs, the animal was sacrificed after two days of 
the CCNU protocol, with agreement of the 
owner. 
 
At necropsy, no macroscopic lesions in CNS 
were observed, except for the cerebral 
congestion. Histological examination revealed 
neoplastic lymphoid cell infiltration of the 
spleen, all lymph nodes, cerebellum and 
cerebrum (Fig. 2).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
 
Lymphoma within the CNS develops most 
commonly as part of a multicentric or systemic 
process (Long et al., 2001), as observed in this 
report. The clinical signs produced by CNS 
tumors are nonspecific and depend on the 
location of the lesion (Fondevila et al., 1998). 
Animals can present seizures, cranial nerve 
deficits, paresis, behavioral changes and 
progressive ataxia (Rosin, 1982; Couto et al., 
1984; Long et al., 2001; Fighera et al., 2002). 
This dog had neurological signs compatible with 
multifocal alterations that were confirmed by the 
histological exam.  
 
The characteristics of the CSF in dogs with CNS 
lymphoma include high white blood cell counts 
and protein, and 95% to 100% of abnormal 
lymphoid cells (Couto et al., 1984), as described 
in this case. Histological or cytological 
examination is probably the most definitive way 
to diagnose lymphoma in CNS (Rosin, 1982); 
however, histological examination usually is 
limited to the necropsy. There are other 
techniques to diagnose CNS tumors, as 
computerized tomography and magnetic 
resonance imaging (Fulton and Steinberg, 1990; 
Kent et al., 2001), nevertheless these are not 
easily available in Brazil, yet. 
 
Identification of the immunophenotype is 
important in the prognostic and has become an 
essential step in their classification because of 
the relationship between biological behavior and 
response to therapy. T-cell lymphoma has a 
worse prognosis than B-cell lymphomas. 
Antibody markers to CD3 and CD79a show 
cross-reactivity across species lines of B cells 
and T cells respectively (Milner et al., 1996; 
Teske et al., 1994; Fournel-Fleury et al., 2002). 
 
A wide variety of chemotherapeutic protocols for 
the management of canine lymphoma, using 
single agents or combinations of drugs, have 
been effective in inducing remission. However, 
there is no consensus regarding the optimal 
treatment in terms of efficacy, patient survival 
and toxicity (Rosenthal, 1990; Rosenthal and 
MacEwen, 1990; Dobson and Gorman, 1994). In 
veterinary patients with multicentric lymphoma, 
it can be used a relatively simple and low-cost 
protocol, as COP for example (Dobson and 
Gorman, 1994; Vail et al., 2001). This is well

tolerated by the animals and results in a 60% to 
70% complete response rate with a median 
survival of six to seven months (Cotter and 
Goldstein, 1983). The dog presented a good 
response until the fifth week of therapy when it 
started to show neurological signs. Lomustine 
was introduced because of its high lipid 
solubility and ability to cross the blood-brain 
barrier (Fulton and Steinberg, 1990; Pfaff et al., 
2000; Fan and Kitchell, 2000; Fan et al., 2002). 
Despite of the change in protocol, the lymphoma 
was in advanced stage and the dog did not 
respond to the therapy. 
 
This report is important due to an uncommon 
clinical presentation of a multicentric lymphoma. 
In spite of the good response to chemotherapy, it 
is essential to follow the clinical signs and 
laboratorial exams in patients with lymphoma to 
search metastasis. Besides, it is essential to make 
CSF analysis and immunophenotype for 
diagnosis and prognosis of CNS neoplasm.
