Abstract 

 

Three-dimensional (3D) biodegradable composite porous scaffolds made of a 

biopolymer matrix (chitosan) and a bioactive glass (FastOs®BG-Z4) were fabricated via 

freeze drying as guides for nerve tissue engineering applications. For this purpose, chitosan 

was dissolved in aqueous solutions of lactic acid (LA, 1 wt.%) to reach a final 

concentration of 2 wt.%. Subsequently FastOs®BG-Z4 in powder form was added to 

chitosan solution in a chitosan/Fasto®BG-Z4 weight ratio of 50/50. The 

Chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 systems were cross-linked via adding different concentrations 

(0.01, 0.05 and 0.5 wt.%) of two kinds of cross-linking agents, genipin, a natural 

component, and glutaraldehyde, a synthetic agent, to stiffen the chitosan network. The final 

mixtures were then frozen at two temperatures, ?20ºC and ?80ºC followed by freeze-

drying to obtain porous scaffolds. 

For achieving the optimal Chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 scaffolds, the influences of adding 

FastOs®BG-Z4 powder and/or different amounts of crosslinking agents on the rheological 

properties of chitosan/LA solutions were firstly investigated by rheological measurements. 

The results showed that a strong and stable gel could not be obtained even when the 

highest amount of cross-linking agents (0.5 wt.%) was added to the 2 wt.% chitosan 

solution, while effective cross-linking occurred in the presence of FastOs®BG-Z4 powder. 

Therefore, it was concluded that FastOs®BG-Z4 plays an active role on chitosan 

complexation. The positive interactions between chitosan and the surface of FastOs®BG-

Z4 particles and/or the ionic species leached out to the solution needs to be further 

investigated in future work. 

The microstructural features of porous scaffolds were investigated by scanning electron 

microscope (SEM), and the porosity assessment was made by ethanol replacement method. 

The mechanical properties of porous scaffolds were investigated under 

compression/swelling tests with samples immersed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 

solution. In vitro degradation tests were also performed by immersing the samples in 



 

iv 

phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution for 2 months tests and the degradation degree 

was evaluated through the undergone weight changes.  

The results showed some common features among genipin or glutaraldehyde as cross-

linking agents: increasing their amounts from 0.01 to 0.5 wt.% led to reductions in gelling 

time, porosity fraction, swelling and degradation rate, while cross-linking degree increased. 

However, their effects on pore size and compression strength of the scaffolds diverged. For 

genipin pore size decreased and consequently the compression strength increased, while 

for glutaraldehyde pore size always increased with added amounts, but compression 

strength was improved with concentration increasing from 0.01 to 0.05 wt.%, decreasing 

when the added amount was further increased to 0.5 wt.%.  

Moreover, ?20ºC was selected as the most suitable freezing temperature when 

considering the porous microstructural features and the intended applications.

Resumo 

 

A presente tese relata acerca do fabrico e caracterização de compósitos porosos 

tridimensionais (3D) biodegradáveis baseados em quitosano, como matriz biopolimérica, 

carregada com partículas de um vidro bioativo (Fastos®BG-Z4). Para este efeito, o 

quitosano foi dissolvido em solução aquosa de ácido láctico (LA, 1% em peso) até atingir 

uma concentração final de 2% em peso. Subsequentemente o Fastos®BG-Z4 em forma de 

pó foi adicionado à solução de quitosano em uma proporção em peso de quitosano/ 

Fastos®BG-Z4 de 50/50. Os sistemas quitosano/Fastos®BG-Z4 foram reticulados por meio 

de adição de diferentes percentagens em peso (0.01, 0.05 e 0.5) de dois tipos de agentes de 

ligação cruzada, um componente natural, genipin, e um agente sintético, glutaraldeído. As 

misturas finais foram então reticuladas a 60ºC seguido de congelamento a duas 

temperaturas diferentes, ?20ºC e ?80ºC. O gelo foi depois sublimado por liofilização de 

modo a obter matrizes porosas para aplicações como guias em engenharia de tecidos 

nervosos periféricos. 

Com vista à optimização do processo de fabrico e das propriedades das estruturas 

porosas de suporte (andaimes) de quitosano/Fastos®BG-Z4, estudaram-se os efeitos da 

adição do Fastos®BG-Z4 em pó e/ou de diferentes quantidades de agentes de reticulação 

nas propriedades reológicas das soluções de LA/quitosano. Os resultados mostraram a 

impossibilidade de obter de um gel de quitosano suficientemente forte e estável mesmo 

quando a quantidade mais elevada de agentes de reticulação (0.5% em peso) foi adicionada 

à solução de quitosano, em contraste com o que aconteceu com a adição do pó de 

Fastos®BG-Z4 na ausência de outros agentes de reticulação. Esta descoberta permitiu 

concluir que o Fastos®BG-Z4 desempenha um papel activo na complexação do quitosano. 

As interacções positivas entre o quitosano e a superfície das partículas do Fastos®BG-Z4 

e/ou as espécies iónicas lixiviadas para a solução precisam de ser melhor investigadas no 

futuro.

As características microestruturais dos materiais porosos foram investigadas por 

microscopia electrónica de varrimento (SEM), e a porosidade foi determinada pelo método 

de substituição de etanol. As propriedades mecânicas dos compósitos porosos imersos em 

solução (PBS) de solução salina tamponada com fosfato foram investigadas através de 

testes de compressão/inchamento. Realizaram-se também testes de degradação in vitro por 

imersão das amostras na mesma solução de PBS durante 2 meses, e o grau de degradação 

foi avaliado através das alterações de peso sofridas pelas amostras. 

Os resultados mostraram algumas características comuns entre o genipin e o 

glutaraldeído como agentes de reticulação: o aumento das quantidades adicionadas 

(0.01?0.5% em peso) levou a reduções no tempo de gelificação, na fracção de porosidade, 

no grau de inchamento, e na taxa de degradação, enquanto o grau de reticulação aumentou. 

No entanto, os seus efeitos sobre o tamanho dos poros e a resistência à compressão dos 

suportes porosos divergiram. O tamanho de poro diminuiu no caso do genipin, o que se 

traduziu em consequentes aumentos da resistência à compressão; enquanto o tamanho dos 

poros aumentou sempre com as quantidades adicionadas no caso do glutaraldeído, pelo que 

só foram registadas melhorias na resistência à compressão na gama de concentrações entre 

0.01?0.05% em peso, diminuindo quando a quantidade adicionada foi aumentada para 0,5 

% em peso. 

Verificou-se ainda que a temperatura de ?20ºC era a que permitia obter as 

microestruturas porosas mais adequadas para as aplicações almejadas.

1.1 Tissue Engineering 

 

Nowadays, the tissues and/or organs for transplantation mainly come from donations 

which, however, cannot meet the clinical needs as a result of several shortcomings of this 

treatment such as longer operation to remove tissue from the donor site, the quality and 

quantity of tissue available for grafting, the risk of immune response and the transmission 

of viral and prionic diseases and infections from the donor, as well as the insufficient 

number of suitable donors available. In some cases permanent prostheses may be used to 

restore partial function to the injured organ. However, the artificial nature of prostheses 

causes several problems, which are considered to be of less importance in comparison to 

regeneration of the injured organ. In order to overcome the limitations of transplantation 

and prosthesis, a new interdisciplinary field called tissue engineering was greatly 

developed and artificial tissues and organs have been fabricated in vitro along the last two 

decades [1] [2]. 

The first tissue engineering definition was made in 1988 at National Science Foundation 

meeting as “The application of the principles and methods of engineering and the life 

science toward the fundamental understanding of structure-function relationships in normal 

and pathological mammalian tissue and the development of biological substitutes to 

restore, maintain or improve functions” [3]. The innovative approach of tissue engineering 

is to seed isolated cells with tissue inducing substances, such as growth and differentiation 

factors, on a scaffold which mimics the extracellular matrix (ECM) and acts as a cell 

attachment, proliferating, migrating and functioning environment (Figure 1.1) [3]. 

 

 

 

 

 

 



Introduction 3 

 

 

 
 

Figure  1.1. Diagram of tissue engineering approach [3]. 

 

 

One of the principal methods in tissue engineering involves the use of porous scaffolds 

to support and guide the in-growth of cells. Tissue scaffolds must be biocompatible, 

biodegradable, bioresorbable, and sterilizable. The scaffold must provide a number of 

properties and functionalities, including: (i) enough mechanical strength in order to 

facilitate in vitro handling and withstand the in vivo environment; (ii) sustaining cell 

function and provide an environment suitable for cellular growth; (iii) contain suitable 

surface properties (wettability, stiffness, and compliance) to support cell attachment, 

proliferation and differentiation. The degradation products should be biocompatible, non-

toxic, and transportable out of the body [4]. Additionally, the pore architecture of scaffolds 

has been shown to have a significant effect on physical properties and cellular activities. It 

has been hypothesized that the pore diameter must be large enough to allow infiltration of 

the cells towards the centre of the scaffold, whilst being small enough to present sufficient 

ligand density for cellular attachment. The optimal pore size is dependent on both the cell 

type and scaffold material [2]. Lee [5] proposed a minimum pore size of 150 ?m for hard 

tissue and 200–250 ?m for soft tissue ingrowth.

1.2 Objectives 
 

The aims of this project are (a) developing 3D biodegradable composite porous 

scaffolds made of chitosan and bioactive glass (FastOs®BG-Z4) as guides for peripheral 

nervous tissue regeneration; (b) microstructural and mechanical characterization of the 

prepared scaffolds. For this purpose, Chitosan was dissolved in aqueous solutions of lactic 

acid (LA) to which powdered FastOs®BG-Z4 bioactive glass was added together with 

different amounts of crosslinking agents (glutaraldehyde and genipin) to reticulate the 

chitosan. The final mixtures were reticulated at suitable temperature and then frozen at two 

different temperatures (?20ºC and ?80ºC) followed by freeze-drying to obtain porous 

scaffolds.  

For achieving the optimal chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 scaffolds, the dependence of the 

rheological properties of chitosan/LA solutions with fixed chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 ratio 

(50:50) and different amounts of cross-linking agents (0.01, 0.05, 0.5 wt.% related to the 

dry weight of chitosan) will be firstly investigated. The effects of cross-linking agents and 

their concentrations on gelation time, and on the physical and structural features of 

scaffolds (pore size, pore size distribution, compressive strength, swelling and degradation 

behaviours) will be investigated.

2.1 Nerve Tissue, Injuries and Regeneration 

 

The human nervous system is classified into two systems, central nervous system (CNS) 

and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS includes the brain, spinal cord, optic, 

olfactory and auditory systems. Peripheral nerves are cord-like structures containing 

bundles of nerve fibres that carry information from regions of the body to the spinal cord 

(and vice versa). Peripheral nerves have a tough outer layer of connective tissue that 

surrounds discrete groups of miniscule fibres, called “axons,” each originating from its 

own nerve cell (Figure 2.1) [6] [7].  

Endoneurium surrounds individual axons and their Schwann cell sheaths and is 

composed predominantly of oriented collagen fibres. Next, the perineurium, formed from 

many layers of flattened cells (i.e., fibroblasts) and collagen, surrounds groups of axons to 

form fascicles. Finally, epineurium, an outer sheath of loose fibrocollagenous tissue, binds 

individual nerve fascicles into a nerve trunk [6] [7].

State of The Art 7 

 
 

The spinal cord is composed of dendrites, axons, and cell bodies (Figure  2.2). The 

centre of the spinal cord, a butterfly-shaped region referred to as grey matter, contains the 

cell bodies of excitatory neurons, as well as glial cells and blood vessels. The grey matter 

is surrounded by white matter, which helps to protect and insulate the spinal cord. White 

matter consists of axons and glial cells [6] [7].

Injuries in the central nervous system have only a very limited capacity to heal, because 

nerve regeneration tends not to occur. In contrast, peripheral nerves have a remarkable 

capacity for regeneration. Even completely severed peripheral nerves, if repaired promptly, 

can regrow, allowing the patients to enjoy complete or nearly complete recovery in many 

cases [6] [7]. 

Peripheral nerves are fragile and easily damaged. A peripheral nerve, when severed, is 

capable of a significant amount of regeneration. Peripheral nerves are discrete trunks filled 



8 State of The Art 

 
 

with sensory and motor axons, and support a number of cell types, such as Schwann cells 

and fibroblasts [6] [7]. The peripheral nerve trunk can be considered as a protective 

structure for axons. The most popular approach in peripheral nerve tissue engineering 

involves in vivo implantation of artificial scaffolds and substrates that will guide naturally 

regenerating axons to the distal segment.  

As described by Seddon in 1975 [8], there are three different classifications for 

peripheral nerve injuries: (1) neuropraxia which is the lowest degree of nerve injury in 

which the nerve remains intact but signalling ability is damaged, (2) axonotmesis which is 

the second class in which the axon is damaged but the surrounding connecting tissue 

remains intact, (3) neurotmesis or transection injuries where the nerve trunk is completely 

interrupted, especially those resulting in large neural gaps, may have a devastating impact 

on patients, quality of life, and in these cases reconstructive surgery is required as a 

therapeutic management to achieve nerve regeneration and function restoration. In 

consequence, peripheral nerve repair represents a unique challenge and opportunity to 

clinical and translational neurosciences [9]. 

 

2.2 Current Clinical Approaches for Treating Nerve Injuries 

 

It is commonly accepted that physical guidance of axons is a vital component of nerve 

repair. In 1960s, Millesi [6] determined that the use of nerve grafts reduced tension on the 

damaged nerves in many cases and further enhanced functional recovery. Later research 

demonstrated that biochemical signals as well as physical guidance are critical for nerve 

regeneration [7]. 

For peripheral nerve injury, treatment typically consists of either direct end-to-end 

suture of the damaged nerve ends (Figure  2.3) or the use of an autologous nerve graft. 

Performing an end-to-end suture can repair small defects or gaps in the nerve. For longer 

nerve gaps, this surgical approach would induce tension of the suture site, inhibiting the 

nerve regeneration and promoting necrosis of the nerve stumps. Thus, for a larger nerve 

defect, an autologous nerve graft that is harvested from another site in the body is used to 

span the injury site. Disadvantages of this technique include loss of function at the donor 



State of The Art 9 

 
 

site, the need for multiple surgeries and the differences between the donor and the receptor 

nerve diameter, compromising the nerve regeneration [6]. 

For central nervous system injury, and particularly spinal cord injury, clinical treatment 

is less promising. Unfortunately, there is currently no treatment available to restore nerve 

function. After swelling from the injury subsides, patients begin a long period of 

rehabilitation during which time they train remaining nerves to compensate for the loss due 

to injury [1] [3].

2.3 Challenges and Bioengineering Strategies for Nerve Repair 

 

In the PNS, the challenge is to find an alternative to the autologous nerve graft and thus 

eliminate the need for two surgeries and the removal of tissue from the patient. Thus, 

bioengineering strategies for the PNS have focused on developing alternative treatments to 

the nerve graft (e.g., nerve guidance channels), especially for larger defects, and improving 

recovery rates and functional outcome. Many researchers are presently focusing efforts on 

creating physical or chemical pathways for regenerating axons [6] [7]. 

The CNS is a greater challenge for new therapies. The ability of spinal nerves to 

regenerate was not decisively shown until 1980, and it was not until after this time that 

research in this area rapidly developed. In addition, results from various studies have been 

controversial and complicated. These challenges provide fertile ground for the 

development of therapies and devices to enhance regeneration [6].

2.4 Neural Tissue Engineering 

 

Nerve tissue engineering (NTE) offers great opportunities to neuroscientists and 

surgeons who have been collaborating to develop tissue engineered nerve grafts [9]. It is 

one of the most promising methods in biomedical engineering for restoring central nerve 

systems in humans and for repairing or replacing the function of defective or damaged 

tissues or organs. Nerve tissue repair is a prized treatment concept in human health care, 

because it has a direct impact on the quality of life [10]. Tissue engineered nerve grafts are 

typically composed of a physical scaffold with the introduction of support cells and/or 

growth factors or other biomolecular components [9]. 

 

2.5 Neural Scaffolds 
 

The physical scaffold of tissue engineered nerve grafts, shortly called the neural 

scaffold, serves to: (1) direct axons sprouting from the proximal to distal nerve stump; (2) 

maintain adequate mechanical support for the regenerating nerve fibres; (3) provide a 

conduit channel for the diffusion of neurotropic and neurotrophic factors secreted by the 

proximal nerve stump and a conduit wall for the exchange of nutrients and waste products; 

(4) obviate the infiltration of fibrous scar tissue that hinders axonal regeneration; and (5) 

create an optimal microenvironment (niche) for nerve regeneration through the 

accumulation and release of exogenous and endogenous biochemical effects. For the sake 

of clinical use, the neural scaffold is hoped to be easy to fabricate and sterilize, and simple 

to implant in the body by microsurgical techniques. Up to now, a diverse array of natural 

or synthetic biomaterials, together with well-defined fabrication techniques, has been tried 

to prepare neural scaffolds that possess different structures, in which tubular nerve 

guidance conduit (NGC) is the basic structure [9].  

 

2.5.1 Requirements of an Ideal Scaffold 

 

An ideal neural scaffold has to satisfy many biological and physicochemical 

requirements, among which biocompatibility, biodegradability, permeability, 



State of The Art 11 

 
 

biomechanical properties, and surface properties are the major concerns. These required 

properties are mainly determined by the scaffold material and scaffold structure [9].  

Figure  2.4 shows the various characteristics desired for an ideal scaffold for neural 

regeneration [10]. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Figure  2.4. Ideal properties of a scaffold for neural regeneration [10]. 

 

2.5.1.1 Biocompatibility 
 

The biocompatibility of neural scaffolds can be evaluated from three important aspects: 

(i) blood compatibility, (ii) histocompatibility, and (iii) mechanical compatibility. Blood 

compatibility requires that the scaffold in contact with blood does not induce hemolysis, or 

destroy blood components, or lead to coagulation and thrombus formation. 

Histocompatibility means that the scaffold has no toxic side effects on the surrounding 

tissues, especially neither teratogenicity nor gene mutation, while the surrounding tissues, 

in turn, do not induce corrosive effects or immune rejection on the scaffold. Mechanical

compatibility focuses on the matching of mechanical properties between the scaffold and 

nerve tissues [9]. 

 

2.5.1.2 Biodegradability 
 

In addition to biocompatibility, an ideal scaffold has to possess a controllable ability to 

degrade in vivo. The tuneable degradation kinetics should match the rate of nerve 

regeneration. The ideal neural scaffold should remain intact for the time axons need to 

regenerate across the nerve gap and then degrade gradually with minimal swelling and 

foreign body reaction [9]. 

 

2.5.1.3 Permeability 
 

As a soft tissue engineered product, a neural scaffold must have a sufficient 

permeability for nutrient and gas exchange, including the exchange of fluids between the 

regeneration environment and the surrounding tissues, avoiding the build-up of pressure 

due to fluid retention. Different fabrication techniques affect the permeability by altering 

the porous structure of neural scaffolds, and hydrophilic property of the scaffold material is 

another critical factor responsible for the permeability of neural scaffolds [9]. 

 

2.5.1.4 Biomechanical Properties 
 

Sufficient mechanical strength needs to be considered when designing ideal neural 

scaffolds. A neural scaffold must be flexible to allow bending without kinking as well. It is 

important to make the right balance between the flexibility and hardness, because too stiff 

scaffolds are easy to cause dislocation, and too flexible scaffolds fail to support axonal 

regeneration [9] [11].

2.5.2.1 Natural Polymers 

 

The selection of biomaterials is very important for the fabrication of neural scaffolds. A 

wide variety of biomaterials has been attempted, which are of either natural or synthetic 

origin. Natural polymers, such as chitosan, alginate, and especially collagen and fibrin, due 

to their structural similarity with the neural structure, and properties such as cell 

attachment, growth and proliferation, have more advantages than synthetic polymers, but 

their low mechanical properties and their tendency to swell is still a problem to overcome 

to foster the widespread use of such materials. However, designs with small nerve gaps 

have been responsive [12] [13]. Biodegradable nerve guides must be preferred since no 

foreign body material will be left in the host after the device has fulfilled its task [12]. 

 

2.5.2.1.1 Collagen and Other ECM Components 

 

Collagen is the major component of the extracellular matrix and is known to promote 

cellular proliferation and tissue healing. Among the most promising biomimetic 

biomaterials for nerve regeneration, collagen proved to lead to functional recovery similar 

to nerve autografts in experimental animal models. Conduits derived from biologic 

molecules like collagen have demonstrated improved regeneration [14] [15]. Gelatin, 

derived from denatured collagen, is also the first biodegradable material examined for 

preparing neural scaffolds. Other ECM molecule-derived materials, for example, laminin 

and fibronectin, are also used for the fabrication of neural scaffolds [9].  

 

2.5.2.1.2 Alginate 

 

Alginate, commonly purified from seaweed, is a naturally occurring copolymer [9]. 

Prang et al. [16] have assessed the capacity of alginate gels to promote directed axonal 

regrowth in the injured mammalian central nervous system. The alginate scaffolds also 

promoted adult peripheral nerve survival and highly oriented axon regeneration. This was 

the first instance of using alginates to produce anisotropic-structured capillary gels, so 



State of The Art 15 

 
 

further studies are needed to investigate the long-term physical stability of the alginate 

scaffolds, because central nervous system axon regeneration can take many months to 

occur. 

 

2.5.2.1.3 Polysialic Acid 

 

Polysialic acid (PSA) is a relatively new biocompatible and bioresorbable material for 

artificial nerve conduit. PSA shows stability under cell culture conditions and allows for 

degradation induced by enzymes. It has also been discovered recently that PSA is involved 

in steering processes like neuritogenesis axonal path finding, and neuroblast migration. 

Animals (adult female Sprague–Dawley rats) with PSA genetically knocked out express a 

lethal phenotype which has unsuccessful path finding, ie, the nerves connecting the two 

brain hemispheres are aberrant or missing. Thus, PSA is vital for proper nervous system 

development [12]. 

 

2.5.2.1.4 Chitin and Chitosan 

 

Chitin is the second most abundant polysaccharide found in nature next to cellulose, and 

can be isolated from the outer shell of crustaceans, insect exoskeletons, and fungal cell 

walls. Chitin is extensively applied in a wide range of biomedical fields [9]. Chitins and 

modified chitins exert a number of beneficial actions, such as: (1) they stimulate 

macrophages by interacting with receptors on the macrophage surface (2) they stimulate 

macrophages to produce cytokines and other compounds that confer nonspecific host 

resistance against bacterial and viral infections, and antitumor activity [17]. The ideal 

structure of chitin is a linear polysaccharide of ? (1?4)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-

glucopyranose, where all residues are comprised entirely of N-acetyl-glucosamine residues 

are fully acetylated. The ideal structure of chitosan, the principal derivative of chitin, is a 

linear polymer of ? (1?4)-2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose, where all residues are 

comprised entirely of N-glucosamine residues or are fully deacetylated. Figure  2.5 is 

showing the ideal chemical representation of chitin and chitosan [18]. 



16 State of The Art 

 
 

 
 

Figure  2.5. Ideal chemical representation of chitin and chitosan [18]. 

 

 

However, the traditional sources of chitin and chitosan are not in fact 100% acetylated 

or deacetylated. They exist as a co-polymer of N-acetylglucosamine and glucosamine, as 

represented in Figure  2.6. The difference between chitin and chitosan is their acetyl 

content. Chitin is made up of more than 50% (more commonly 70-90%) acetamido groups 

while chitosan commonly having 70-90% amino groups. The main parameters influencing 

the chemical characteristics of chitosan are its degree of acetylation that could be within 

the range of 30-95%, and molecular weight, which can vary from 300 to over 1000 kDa 

[18] [19] [20].

character of the biopolymers [18]. 



State of The Art 17 

 
 

Chitosan is highly bioactive, biodegradable and biocompatible; so, it is widely used in 

biomedical applications, such as skin substitutes, wound healing, nerve regeneration, gene 

delivery, cartilage and bone tissue regeneration [18]. Chitosan has quite positive effects on 

the nerve regeneration. It has been showed that when chitosan is used, it facilitates nerve 

healing and improves the nerve differentiation and growth. It also shows antifungal, 

antitumoral, anticholesteremic, antibacterial and antimicrobial characteristics because the 

cationic moieties of chitosan molecules can interact with anionic cell wall of 

bacteria/micro-organisms and rupture their cell wall that reduces the bacteria attachment 

and survivability [20] [21] [22]. 

Chitosan is insoluble in neutral or basic pH solutions, but soluble in acidic solutions (&amp;lt;

pH 6.5), because of presence of primary amine groups which make chitosan a cationic 

polyelectrolyte (pKa ~ 6.5) and allow it to be coupled covalently to the various 

biomolecules, along with its other primary and secondary hydroxyl functional groups [21] 

[23]. 

 

2.5.2.2 Synthetic Polymers  

 

In addition to naturally derived biopolymers, synthetic polymers constitute another class 

of promising biomaterials for fabricating neural scaffolds due to their tuneable chemical 

and physical properties [9].  

Synthetic materials are attractive because their chemical and physical properties (e.g., 

degradation rate, porosity, mechanical strength) can be specifically optimized for a 

particular application [7] [12]. In some cases, synthetic biomaterials are cheaper than 

natural ones, can be produced in larger quantities with uniform properties and have longer 

shelf life [11]. However, the biocompatibility of synthetic materials poses a challenge 

because the body’s inflammatory response can vary considerably from one material to 

another. In addition, some synthetic materials that are tolerated by the body’s immune 

system are unfortunately incompatible with cell adhesion and tissue repair. These materials 

are often modified to render them more “cell friendly” [7] [12]. 



18 State of The Art 

 
 

To select an appropriate synthetic material, there are several general properties that all 

nerve guidance channels should possess: (1) they must be readily formed into a conduit 

with desired dimensions, (2) they must be sterilizable, (3) they must be tear resistant, and 

(4) they must be easy to handle and suture. Permanent materials pose a higher risk for 

infection, are more likely to provoke a chronic inflammatory response, and have the 

potential to compress the nerve over time. Thus, a nerve guide that degrades as the nerve 

regenerates is preferred. Additionally, guidance channels should be pliable, but should 

maintain their shape and resist collapse during implantation and over the time course for 

regeneration. Research has also shown that guidance channels should be semipermeable 

and should have a smooth inner wall. Properties of the ideal nerve guidance channel are 

shown in Figure  2.7 [7] [12]. 

 

 

 
Figure  2.7. Properties of the ideal nerve guidance channel [7]. 

 

 

So the factors that control material selection include biocompatibility, biodegradability, 

mechanical integrity and controllability during nerve growth, implantation and sterilization 

[12].

2.5.2.2.1 Non-absorbable Synthetic Polymers 

 

Beginning in the early 1980s, replacement surgery using artificial nerve conduits made 

from non-absorbable materials, such as silicone Figure  2.8), has been in use for the 

treatment of severed nerves. All these reports, however, are of studies demonstrating 

recovery in morphologic continuity of a nerve with an extremely small gap of about 10 

mm in small laboratory animals, and recovery of motor function has rarely been achieved. 

The outcome is in no way superior to that of nerve autografting in any of the reported 

studies. Elastomer hydrogels or porous stainless steel has also been used for nerve 

regeneration. However, these artificial materials have the disadvantages of engendering 

chronic foreign body reaction due to scar tissue formation, inflexibility, and lack of 

stability [12] [14].

2.5.2.2.2 Absorbable Synthetic Polymers  

 

It became recognized from the latter half of the 1980s onwards that degradable-

absorbable materials are preferable in the body after attaining nerve regeneration. With the 

progress in material synthesis and bridging techniques, artificial nerve guides made of 

absorbable synthetic materials, have been developed. Substances such as polyglycolic acid 

(PGA) and polylactic acid (PLA) or polyhydroxybutyrate are under investigation as 

biodegradable-absorbable synthetic materials for nerve regeneration [12] [14]. Khorasani 

et al. [24] have designed PLLA tubes for nerve regeneration and studied cellular 

investigations and in vitro assessments. These polymers are brittle, and they do not have 

regions permissible for chemical modification. In addition, they degrade by bulk rather 

than by surface, which is not a smooth and ideal degradation process. In an attempt to 

overcome the lack of functionality, free amines have been incorporated into their structures 

from which peptides can be tethered to control cell attachment and behaviour. Other 

biodegradable poly(esters), such as poly(caprolactones), have also demonstrated promise 

for nerve regeneration applications. In addition to poly(esters), biodegradable poly 

(urethane), poly(organo phosphazene), methacrylate-based hydrogels, and poly(3-

hydroxybutyrate) have shown a capacity for guiding regeneration. Biodegradable glass 

tubes have also been studied, but results of pre-clinical studies have not been optimistic 

[12] [14]. 

 

2.5.2.3 Composite Nerve Guides 

 

Composite scaffold materials can be designed from both synthetic and natural polymers 

embedding particles of bioactive and biodegradable inorganic components such as calcium 

phosphates or bioglasses.  

Clinically, type I collagen conduits [25], chitosan [26] [27] [28] and polyphosphoesters 

such as poly (DL-lactide–caprolactone) [29] [30] are popular resorbable biomaterials used 

in nerve tissue repair. However, there is significant scope for improvement with these 

materials.  



State of The Art 21 

 
 

In addition to materials which can interact with the body to improve regeneration, it is 

required to make a balance among mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and controlled 

degradability. Accordingly, composite materials offer significant opportunities for 

investigation [31]. Composites that have combined biodegradable polymers and bioactive 

inorganic phases such as hydroxyapatite (HA) [32] [33], ?-TCP [34] [35] or bioactive glass 

[36] [37] [38] have resulted in resorbable scaffolds with tailored biocompatibility and 

improved physical and mechanical properties, especially in hard tissue regeneration. 

Additionally, some of degradation by-products can be clinically beneficial. So, composite 

materials, if properly designed and optimized, may allow the development of scaffolds 

with tailored physical, biological and mechanical properties to suitably match the 

application of peripheral nerve repair [31]. 

Guidance of developing axons involves turning of the motile tip, the growth cone [39], 

and is dependent on extracellular cues, including ionic messengers. Divalent calcium ion 

(Ca2+) is the most widely used messenger which regulates turning (guidance) and extension 

of the growth cone [40] [41]. Zinc (Zn2+) is the second most existing trace element in the 

human body and is required for normal growth and correct immune function [42], it is also 

an effective antibacterial agent [43]. It has also been suggested that Zn2+ may be a valuable 

specific therapy for uremic polyneuropathy and nerve development [42]. From a material 

viewpoint, the synthesis of degradable bioglasses containing these elements is a possible 

way to release controlled levels of these therapeutic ions in controlled levels is possible via 

the synthesis of degradable bioglasses containing these elements [44] [ [45]. Therefore, 

combining such bioglasses with polymers appears as a quite promising strategy to enhance 

the mechanical properties of the scaffolds and their biological responses in vivo.  

Bioactive materials elicit an appropriate biological response when implanted in vivo, 

enabling the formation of bonds between materials and surrounding tissues. Bioactive 

glasses are commonly described as ideal materials for bone tissue regeneration due to their 

ability to promote osteointegration, mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, and promotion 

of growth factor [46]. Bioactive glasses have been used in biological applications since 

Hench described their use the early 70s. There have been interesting research works about 

bioactive glasses in science and biomedical applications over the last two decades, as 

evidenced by the growing number of publications in this field [47]. Bioactive glasses have 

shown tailored therapeutic ion release, primarily in hard tissues. However, as described 



22 State of The Art 

 
 

before, controlled degradation and release of therapeutic ions from these biomaterials may 

also play an important role in soft tissue regeneration such as repairing of peripheral nerve 

gaps [44]. There has been relatively little research on the application of bioactive glasses 

on repairing of peripheral nerve gaps. According to Buting et al. [36], fibres of Bioglass® 

45S5 can form a biocompatible scaffold to guide re-growing peripheral axons in vivo. 

Kehoe [31] has successfully designed a nerve guidance conduit consists of PLGA (lactic to 

glycolic acid mole ratio, 75:25) and a zinc-silicate based bioactive glass and evaluated the 

cytotoxicity and mechanical properties of conduit. Zhang et al. [44] have designed silica-

based glasses (Si–Na–Ca–Zn–Ce system) and investigated composition-structure-property 

relationships in these systems with respect to their potential use as fillers in polymeric 

(PLGA) composite constructs for peripheral nerve regeneration. They have evaluated the 

Ca2+ and Zn2+ release profile for this purpose. Release of such elements, at appropriate 

levels, from peripheral nerve guidance conduits may be advantageous with respect to the 

repair of peripheral nerve discontinuities. 

Goel et al. [45] have designed and developed alkali-free series of bioactive glasses in 

the glass system CaO–MgO–SiO2–P2O5–CaF2 along the diopside (CaMgSi2O6)–

fluorapatite (Ca5(PO4)3F)–TCP (3CaO.P2O5) join. FastOs®BG is a common designation for 

these developed bioactive glasses, which can be doped with some other elements such as 

Sr, Zn, Mn, etc. It was demonstrated that these glasses exhibit high rate of in vitro 

bioactivity, but detailed in vitro cell culture and in vivo tests need to be carried out on this 

bioactive glass in order to prove their efficacy for application in human biomedicine. On 

the other hand, the bioactive glasses having high alkali metal content (sodium and 

potassium) are sensitive to water uptake resulting in swelling and cracking of the polymer 

matrix embedding them in composites [48]. So, it can be concluded that by using these 

alkali-free bioactive glasses embedded in polymer matrix, the rate of swelling and 

degradation of composites can be controlled which is important in nerve tissue 

regeneration. In fact, the resistance to deformation determines whether the conduit can be 

used in vivo due to the various stresses from the surrounding tissue while the resistance to 

swelling protects the regenerated nerve axons from being compressed by the conduit wall. 

The swelling should be moderate [49] [50]. 

Recently, chitosan-based nerve conduits extensively developed to bridge large 

peripheral nerve gaps have achieved considerable success [50] [51] [52] [53] [54].

However, there is currently no research using the combination of chitosan and 

FastOs®BG in nerve tissue repair. Thus, in this study, novel biodegradable composite 

membranes based on chitosan and FastOs®BG doped with 4 mol% Zn (FastOs®BG-Z4) 

were synthesized aiming at nerve regeneration applications. It is hypothesized that 

FastOs®BG-Z4 particles will improve the mechanical properties of the membranes to resist 

muscular contractions and maintain a stable support structure to provide space for nerve 

regeneration. It is also expected that the controlled ionic release from FastOs®BG-Z4 will 

assist in nerve regeneration and in preventing oxidative stress [45].  

 

2.6 Cross-linked Chitosan Scaffolds 

 

For generating chitosan scaffolds, the polymer has to be cross-linked to raise its 

stability. Cross-linking treatments are split into two groups: chemical cross-linking and 

biophysical cross-linking. Chemical methods include the use of various chemical reagents, 

whereas biophysical methods include the use of UV light and dehydrothermal cross-

linking [2].  

Chitosan can be cross-linked either ionically or covalently. As ionic cross-linkers, 

polyanions like triphosphate, citrate or natural polymers like hyaluronic acid or chondroitin 

sulphate are used. In this connection the polyanion can interact with chitosan via 

electrostatic forces to form an ionic cross-linked network. The other possibility is a 

covalently formed network with the amino and hydroxy-groups of chitosan reacting with 

functional groups of cross-linker molecules. Covalently cross-linked networks can be 

formed by genipin, di- or polyaldehydes (glutaraldehyde, oxidised starch and oxidised 

cylcodextrin). Also, carboxylic acids, azides, epoxides, diisocyanates and silanes are 

compounds that have been used as covalent cross-linkers [55] [56]. 

 

2.6.1 Glutaraldehyde 

 

Glutaraldehyde (GT) is one of the most popular cross-linking treatments for biological 

tissues. It is a bifunctional cross-linker, which reacts with chitosan via either a Schiff base 



24 State of The Art 

 
 

reaction, leading to imine functionality (Figure  2.9), and/or through Michael-type adducts 

with terminal aldehydes, leading to the formation of carbonyl groups. Although being 

widely used, GT mediated cross-linking is often cited as being undesirable as it introduces 

cytotoxic aldehyde molecules [57] [58]. 

 

 
 

Figure  2.9. The chemical structure of GT-cross-linked chitosan [57]. 

 

 

2.6.2 Genipin 

 

Genipin (GP) (Figure  2.10) can be obtained from its parent compound, geniposide, 

which is isolated from the fruits of Gardenia jasminoides ELLIS. GP and its related iridoid 

glucosides have been widely used as antiphlogistics and cholagogues in herbal medicine. It 

has been used as a cross-linking agent for the fixation of biological tissues as 

bioprostheses. It can react spontaneously with amino acids or proteins to form dark blue 

pigments. GP is about 5000?10,000 times less cytotoxic than glutaraldehyde [59] [60] 

[61].

Figure  2.10. Schematic of GP chemical structure [60]. 

 
 

Mi et al. [62] have shown that cross-linking of chitosan membrane using GP reduced its 

tensile strain, swelling ratio and enzymatic degradability. According to Chiono et al. [63], 

chitosan/gelatin blends cross-linked with optimal additions of GP were able to support 

neuroblastoma cell adhesion and proliferation, and cross-linking degree increased with 

increasing the GP amount as a result of higher water stability and mechanical stiffness. 

Sung [64] has shown that differences in cross-linking structure may affect the mechanical 

properties and the bonding characteristics of the graphs to living tissues. 

 

2.7 Fabrication Techniques for Nerve Guidance Conduit 

 

To more accurately mimic natural repair in the body, recent studies have focused on the 

use of various advanced approaches to create complex guidance channels and to combine 

multiple stimuli into a single therapy. With regard to advanced guidance channel 

fabrication, most techniques have focused on creating intricate internal structures that more 

accurately mimic the nerve architecture, such as the inclusion of fibres and channels to 

guide individual nerve fibres. In general, researchers have attempted to improve the neural 

scaffold properties by several novel fabricating techniques such as magnetic polymer fibre 

alignment, injection moulding, solid free-form fabrication, ink-jet polymer printing, 

nanofibre self-assembly, solvent casting and particulate leaching, gas foaming, 

emulsification/freeze-drying, liquid-liquid phase separation, electrospinning, incorporating 

nerve growth factors in the scaffold and improving the wettability of the scaffold surface 

by surface modifications [10] [14]. Each technique is briefly described below. 



26 State of The Art 

 
 

2.7.1 Magnet Alignment and Injection Moulding 

 

Nerve guidance channels have been predominantly fabricated as hollow tubes or as 

porous foam rods because of the ease in manufacturing these devices. For hollow tubes, it 

is known that the body normally generates an oriented fibrin matrix after placement of a 

hollow conduit across a nerve defect, which serves as a critical precursor to axonal 

regeneration. With regard to foam rods, it is questionable whether an amorphous irregular 

structure optimally guides axonal regeneration. Thus, to mimic natural repair in the body 

and to shorten the time required for regeneration, more recent studies have focused on the 

modification of nerve guidance channels with internal matrices of longitudinally aligned 

fibres or channels. These devices often require more advanced processing techniques. As a 

means to provide the necessary matrix alignment and also improve upon processing 

conditions, magnetic fields have been used to orient protein polymers. In a different 

approach, a novel foam-processing technique, utilizing low-pressure injection moulding, 

created highly porous conduits from PLGA with continuous longitudinal channels [10]. 

 

2.7.2 Phase Separation 

 

When using phase separation, a porous structure can be easily obtained by adjusting 

thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. However, because of the complexity of the 

processing variables involved in the phase separation technique, the pore structure cannot 

be easily controlled. Moreover, it is difficult to obtain large pores, which may exhibit a 

lack of interconnectivity [65]. 

 

2.7.3 Gas Foaming 

 

Gas foaming has the advantage of room temperature processing but produces a largely 

nonporous outer skin layer and a mixture of open and closed pores within the centre, 

leaving incomplete interconnectivity. The main disadvantages of the gas foaming is that it 

often results in a non-connected cellular structure within the scaffold [66]. 



State of The Art 27 

 
 

2.7.4 Solvent Casting 

 

Solvent casting is a combination with particulate leaching method, which involves the 

casting of a mixture of monomers and initiator solution and a porogen in a mould, termed 

polymerization, followed by leaching-out of the porogen with the proper solvent to 

generate the pores. It is inexpensive but still has to overcome some disadvantages in order 

to find engineering applications as structures that facilitate either tissue regeneration or 

repair during reconstructive operations [66].  

 

2.7.5 Freeze Drying 

 

Freeze drying technique is based upon the principle of sublimation to fabricate porous 

scaffolds. The typical process would be to dissolve the polymer into a solvent in order to 

form a solution of desired concentration. Then the solution is frozen and solvent will be 

removed by lyophilisation under a high vacuum. In this method, the pore size and porous 

structure can be controlled by the freezing rate, pH, and temperature. However, the small 

pore size formed in this technique is a concern for some applications and also the time 

consuming lyophilisation step [1].  

Generally, the freeze-drying process can be split into two parts: freezing and drying. 

During freezing the temperature of the solution is lowered and a phase change occurs, 

where liquid water is converted into ice crystals. The cooling rate is an important aspect of 

the freezing cycle because it affects the ice crystal formation during freezing. Fast rates of 

cooling have a tendency to produce many small ice crystals. These crystals may not be 

continuous, but they are generally homogeneously distributed throughout the frozen 

solution. A slow rate of freezing will result in a more connected ice crystal structure with 

larger crystals [2]. 

So, to produce large ice crystals, the freezing temperature should be as high as possible 

and the time for crystallization should be extended. To produce smaller crystals, freezing 

should take place under low temperature conditions and the freezing rate should be high in 

order to reduce the time available for ice crystals to grow [67].  



28 State of The Art 

 
 

The next step in the process is drying in which heat is added to the material under a 

vacuum. Under these conditions the ice crystals are sublimated from the solute. The 

sublimated water vapour is then trapped on a condenser, and the process is complete [2]. 

With freeze drying system, two kinds of biomaterials with different properties can be 

combined to produce scaffold structures with good biocompatibility in the inner layer and 

with the desired mechanical strength protruded by the outer layer. The forming precision is 

high, the wall thickness can be controlled, and a tight connection between the two layers 

can be achieved [66]. 

Both homogeneous aqueous solutions and heterogeneous dispersions can be frozen and 

freeze-dried to prepare materials with relatively disordered macroporous structures. 

Alternatively, the freezing process can be performed in a more controlled manner to 

orientate the growth of the ice crystals in one direction. Zhang et al. [67] have described 

developments in the use of directional freezing techniques to produce porous materials 

where the orientation of the crystal growth defines the pore structure. They outline how 

these methods can produce complex composite materials with a range of aligned pore 

architectures. Figure  2.11 shows a schematic diagram of the directional freezing process. 

Ice crystals grow from the bottom [67].  

 

 

 
 

Figure  2.11. Scheme showing the directional freezing process [67]. 

 

 



State of The Art 29 

 
 

Particles and polymeric molecules are excluded from the ice and aggregate between the 

growing ice crystals. After the freezing is complete, removal of the orientated ice by freeze 

drying leads to the formation of aligned structures. 

 

2.7.6 Electrospinning 

 

Electrospinning is a simple, unique, and efficient method which has the possibility of 

producing ultrafine multicomposite fibres with spatial orientation and nanodimensions 

with high surface area and controlled pore geometry [68]. A polymer solution or melt is 

drawn from a nozzle by applying a force of gravity or mechanical pressure combined with 

an electric field of high voltage (10–20 kV). When the electric charge overcomes the 

surface tension of the polymer solution droplet, a polymer jet is sprouted, followed by 

solvent evapouration which forms the solid nanofibres [69]. The properties of the 

electrospun fibres such as the diameter, orientation, and porosity influence cell adhesion, 

proliferation and processes such as the transportation of nutrients (e.g. metabolites, 

oxygen) to and from the cells. The orientation of fibres within the engineered scaffold play 

an important role in mimicking the extracellular matrix (ECM) because many tissues in the 

body (e.g., endothelial and nerve cells) have regular oriented architecture, which is 

strongly correlated to their distinguished mechanical properties and particular functions. 

These described factors should be considered while designing and fabricating engineered 

scaffolds for nerve tissue engineering [68]. 

 

2.7.7 Solid Freeform Fabrication 
 

Recently, the emergence of advanced techniques for polymer processing such as solid 

freeform fabrication (SFF) has gained tremendous attention in the bioengineering field 

because of its ability to design of intricate devices for peripheral nerve and spinal cord 

repair. SFF can fabricate 3D porous scaffolds with high degree control microstructure 

directly from a computer model. Some limitations do exist, including the high cost of the 

instrument and the inability to incorporate biological components under some processing 

conditions [6] [70].

3.1 Materials 

 

An alkali-free bioactive glass was selected from a series of compositions (mol%): 36.07 

CaO – (19.24 – x) MgO – xZnO 5.61 P2O5 – 38.49 SiO2 – 0.59 CaF2 [45], where x was 

fixed at 4.00 mol% (FastOs®BG-Z4). The synthesis included high-purity powders of SiO2 

(purity &gt;99.5%), CaCO3 (&gt;99.5%), MgCO3 (BDH Chemicals Ltd., UK, purity &gt;99.0%), 

ZnO (Sigma Aldrich, Germany, 99.9+%), NH4H2PO4 (Sigma Aldrich, Germany, &gt;99.0%) 

and CaF2 (Sigma Aldrich, Germany, 325 mesh,&gt;99.9%), as described elsewhere [45]. A 

homogeneous batch (~100 g) obtained by ball milling, was preheated at 900ºC for 1 h for 

decarbonisation and then melted in a Pt crucible at 1550ºC for 1 h in air. The molten glass 

was poured in cold water to obtain a frit, which was then dried and milled in a high-speed 

agate mill, resulting in fine glass powders with mean particle sizes of ~10?20 ?m 

(determined by light scattering technique; Coulter LS 230, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, 

CA; Fraunhofer optical model). The amorphous nature of glasses was confirmed by X-ray 

diffraction (XRD) analysis (Rigaku Geigerflex D/Max, Tokyo, Japan; C Series; Cu K? 

radiation; 2? angle range 10 – 80; step 0.02 s–1). 

Commercial chitosan with medium molecular weight and a deacetylation percentage 

(DD) of ?85% was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany) and lactic acid (LA) was 

purchased from Fluka (Germany). Glutaraldehyde (50%) was a product of USA and 

genipin was obtained from Challenge Bioproducts (Taiwan). Distilled water was used to 

prepare all the solutions.  

 

3.2 Preparation of Chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 Membranes 

 

The chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 composites were prepared as schematized in Figure  3.1. A 

1 vol.% lactic acid (LA) solution was firstly prepared in distilled water. Then, a 2 wt.% 

chitosan was added to this 1 vol.% LA solution, which was kept under magnetic stirring 

overnight at 50ºC. The as obtained chitosan solution was filtered through a 150 µm sieve 

and FastOs®BG-Z4 powder was then added in order to have a chitosan:Fastos®BG-Z4 

weight ratio of 50:50. Different amounts of genipin and glutaraldehyde (0.01, 0.05 and 0.5 

wt.% relative to the dry mass of chitosan) were separately added as cross-liking agents for 



Experiments 33 
 

 
 

chitosan matrix. The as obtained composite systems were poured into closed special 

moulds to avoid evapouration and left for 20 minutes in an oven at 60ºC to promote 

reticulation. The prepared gels were frozen at ?20ºC for 24 h and ?80ºC for 4 h to evaluate 

the effect of freezing temperature on the membrane properties. The frozen samples were 

then lyophilized in a freeze-dryer (Labconco, USA) (Figure  3.2) at ?50ºC, under vacuum 

(45×10?3 mbar), for 72 h to obtain porous membranes. Dried membranes were stored in a 

desiccator at room temperature until use.

3.3 Characterization and Properties Evaluation 

 

3.3.1 Rheological Properties 

 

The effects of adding different amounts of GP or GT (Table  3.1) or FastOs®BG-Z4 

powder alone, and concomitantly with the different amounts cross-liking agents on the 

gelation behaviour of the final mixtures were evaluated under oscillatory tests carried out 

in a C-VOR rheometer (Bohlin Instruments, USA) (Figure  3.3) equipped with cone and 

plate geometry (Ø = 20 mm, angle =1º, gap = 150 µm) at 60ºC. To minimize the effect of 

the water evaporation, a "solvent trap" was used, in order to saturate the surrounding 

sample environment with water. The oscillatory rheological parameters used to compare 



Experiments 35 
 

 
 

the viscoelastic properties for all the systems were the storage modulus (G?) and the loss 

modulus (G??).  

Preliminary tests were run to determine the linear viscoelastic range in which the 

oscillatory tests would be performed, i.e. the range where response of the sample is within 

the linear viscoelastic region. 

Temperature sweep measurements were also performed for all the systems in order to 

determine the required temperature-time schedule for reticulation to help stipulating the 

experimental conditions to be used in further experiments. Gelation experiments were then 

conducted at a constant frequency (1 Hz) and stress (5 Pa) by recording the variation of the 

elastic modulus (G?) and viscous modulus (G??) along the time at a constant temperature of 

60ºC. The gelation time for each system was considered to be the corresponding to the 

respective crossover point of G? and G??.

3.3.2 FTIR-ATR Spectroscopy Analysis 

 

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-Attenuated total reflectance (FTIR Bruker 

Tensor 27) was used to investigate the characteristic functional groups. For this purpose, 3 

samples GP00 (GT00), GP05-20, and GT05-20 (Table 3.1) were selected and tested within 

the wavelength range 300 – 4000 cm?1, using 276 scans and 4 cm?1 resolution. 

 

3.3.3 Microstructure Analysis 

 

The morphology of the chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 scaffolds’ cross-sections were observed 

by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, S-4100, Tokyo, Japan, 15-kV 

acceleration voltage). The samples were cut into 5 mm diameter discs and coated with a 

thin layer of a gold-palladium alloy by using sputter coater (Polaron Equipment Limited 

SEM coating unit E5000) before SEM analysis.  

 

3.3.4 Cross-linking Degree Determination  

 

The cross-linking degrees of scaffolds reticulated with GP and GT were determined by 

the ninhydrin (NHN) assay described elsewhere [72] [73]. The NHN solution was prepared 

as follows:  

 

Solution A:  

25 ml distilled H2O containing 1.05 g citric acid (99%), 0.4 g NaOH (?97%) and 0.04 g 

SnCl2.2H2O (98%); 

 

Solution B: 

25 ml ethylene glycol monomethyl (?99.5%) containing 1 g NHN.  

 



Experiments 37 
 

 
 

The two solutions were mixed with stirring for 45 min and the final NHN solution was 

stored in a dark bottle.  

Before determination of cross-linking degree, 4 mg of the lyophilized scaffolds from 

each group was heated with 2 ml NHN solution to 100ºC in a water bath for 20 min. The 

solution was then cooled down to 20ºC, diluted with 5 ml of 50% isopropanol, and the 

optical absorbance of the solution at 570 nm was recorded with a spectrophotometer (UV-

210, Hitachi, Japan) (Figure 3.4) using glycine at various known concentrations (1.0, 2.0, 

3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 mg/ml) as standard.  

It is known that, after heating with NHN, the amount of free amino groups in the test 

sample is proportional to the optical absorbance of the solution. The measured 

concentration was divided by the sample weight and multiplied by the sample molecular 

weight to obtain the mole NH2/mole sample. The extent of cross-linking (%CL) for each 

sample was calculated using the following equation: 

 

 

% 	 =
( 	 	 ) 	–	( 	 	 )

( 	 )
×  

 

 

where ‘control’ is the mole fraction of free NH2 in non-cross-linked sample 

(chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 without GP or GT) and ‘fixed’ is the mole fraction of free NH2 

remaining in cross-linked sample. Each determination was performed in triplicate (n = 3).

3.3.5 Pore Size and Porosity Measurement 

 

The porosity of the chitosan scaffolds was evaluated using cylindrical samples of 2.4 

cm (diameter) × 0.9 cm (height) with the ethanol replacement method described by Yang 

et al. [74]. Porosity (%) was calculated by the following equation: 

 

 

	(%) = 	 × 100 =

×

× 100 

 

 

where  is the total volume of the chitosan scaffold (cm3),  is the pore volume of the 

chitosan scaffold (cm3), 	is the weight (g) of the chitosan scaffold after incubation with 

ethanol for 24 h, 	is the original weight (g) of the chitosan scaffold, and 	is the density 

of ethanol (0.789 g cm?3). 

Equivalent circle diameter (ECD) of the pores was calculated by using ImageJ software. 

In brief, the pores were manually picked by built-in drawing functions, and the area (A) of 



Experiments 39 
 

 
 

each pore was subsequently measured by using ‘Measure’ function. The pore diameter was 

then calculated according to following formula:  

 

= 	 4 /  

 

To validate this measurement statistically, at least three images (100 pores) with the 

same magnification representing different areas of the composite were analysed at each 

condition. 

 

3.3.6 Mechanical Properties 

 

The mechanical properties of composite scaffolds reported in Table  3.1 were 

characterized by using a Universal Testing Machine (Shimadzu, AGS-X STD +250) 

(Figure  3.5). Cylindrical samples with dimensions (diameter = 13 mm ± 0.5 mm, and 

length = 0.9 mm ± 0.5 mm) measured using a digital calliper (J.B.S) were tested to 

investigate the effects of different added amounts of cross-linking agents (GP and GT) on 

compressive strength.   

Since scaffolds for nerve regeneration must be used in the hydrated state, mechanical 

tests were performed in wet samples. So, prior to mechanical tests, the composite scaffolds 

were fully immersed into PBS for 24 h to reach equilibrium swelling as explained in 3.3.7 

section. The excess water on the surface was gently removed by a filter paper.  

The compression load applied during compression test was 5 N, the cross head speed 

was set at 1 mm/min and compressive strengths were measured at strains of 20%, 40%, 

and 60%. The tangent slope of the stress–strain curve, with stress (kPa) on Y-axis and 

deformation (%) on X-axis, was measured at 30% deformation to calculate elastic 

modulus. Measurements were made eight times for each composition and average values 

are reported.

3.3.7 Water Uptake (Swelling Test) 

 

The swelling ratio is an important index used to evaluate the structural stability of the 

scaffolds. Because chitosan contains hydroxyl and amino groups, it is easily hydrated in 

water. Swelling will affect the structure of the scaffold [46]. 

The swelling properties of chitosan membranes were studied by immersing the 

previously weighted samples (un-cross-linked chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4, and cross-linked 

ones with the amounts of GP and GT reported in Table 3.1 and frozen at ?20ºC and ?80ºC) 

in 10 ml phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) (pH 7.4) at 37ºC for 24 h. 

At predetermined intervals (30 min, 1, 2, 3, 12 and 24 h), the samples were withdrawn 

from the PBS solution, gently dried with a filter paper to remove the water adhered on the 

surface and then weighted. The swelling ratio (SR) of these samples was calculated by 

using the following equation:

where  and  are the weight of swollen samples at predetermined intervals and dry 

samples, respectively. Each experiment was repeated three times and the average value 

was taken to validate the results. 

 

3.3.8 Weight Loss (Degradation Test) 

 

The in vitro degradation of the samples was evaluated in phosphate buffered saline 

(PBS) solution (pH 7.4) by registering the weight loss evolution with time. The dried 

membranes were cut into small pieces and weighted carefully before in vitro analysis. The 

dried samples were submerged in PBS solution (1:100 w/v) and incubated at 37ºC in an 

incubator (Edmund Bühler GmbH) (Figure  3.6) with constant shaking (120 rpm) over 

indicated periods of time (2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks). PBS solution was refreshed weekly to 

keep a constant pH of 7.4.

Three samples of each group were removed from PBS at predetermined intervals, rinsed

determination. The weight loss ( ) of specimens was calculated via following

where  and  are the composite weight before and after degradation, respectively. The

The curves show an initial slightly decreasing tendency with temperature increasing up 

to minima values that depend on the added amount and type of cross-linker used. This 

decreasing trend, attributed to a reduction of viscosity of the solutions with temperature 

rising, is followed by gradual and then abrupt slop increases as temperature further 

increases.  This last steep increase of G? and G?? is observed within the 60 ? 80ºC range and 

corresponds to the temperature-induced reticulation of the systems. For a given added

amount of cross-linking agents, reticulation reactions seem to systematically occur slightly 

earlier in the presence of GT in comparison to GP.  

The evolution of G? and G?? for systems with added FastOs®BG-Z4 powder in the 

absence and in the presence of the same amounts of cross-linking agents tested for chitosan 

solutions are shown in Figure  4.2 and Figure  4.3, for GP and GT, respectively. Interesting 

features can be observed: the first descending branch of G? and G?? curves observed in 

Figure  4.2 was eliminated in the presence of FastOs®BG-Z4 powder, and reticulation 

occurred faster than when chitosan solutions with added cross-linking agents were tested. 

These features can be attributed to an active reticulation role played by the surface of 

FastOs®BG-Z4 particles and/or by its ionic species leached to the solution.

different amounts of GT. 

 

 

These observations suggest the occurrence of specific and synergetic interactions among 

chitosan molecules, the surface of FastOs®BG-Z4 particles and/or its ionic species leached 

to the solution, and the GT and GP species, which should be responsible for the observed 

faster gelation process. These amazing findings also suggest the possibility of preparing 

self-reticulation chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 composite scaffolds for tissue engineering, thus 

avoiding the use of potentially cytotoxic cross-linkers such as GT [57] [58].  

This hypothesis is confirmed by the gelation temperatures estimated from all the 

temperature sweep tests, which are summarized in Table  4.1. It can be seen that for a given 

added amount of cross-liking agents, the gelation temperature of chitosan solutions was 

always slightly lower for GT in comparison with GP, an observation that is in good 

agreement with the findings reported elsewhere [75]. For composite systems, gelation 

always occurs at lower temperatures in comparison to the chitosan solutions, even in the 

absence of cross-liking agents. These findings open further research avenues that need to 

be explored in future studies. Gelation temperature further decreases with added GP and 

GT, being lowest in the presence of GT due to its enhanced reticulation ability.

Results and Discussion 49 
 

 
 

It can be seen that at this relatively high temperature (60ºC), reticulation started 

immediately eliminating any descending trend of G? and G?? derived from temperature 

dependent solution viscosity, and gelation times became shorter and shorter with 

increasing contents of GP and GT. It is also obvious from these Figures that initially G? &amp;lt;

G??, with both G? and G?? tending to increase with increasing setting time, but G? increases 

faster than G??, thus leading to gelation.  

The time sweep profile at 60ºC for the chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 system in absence of 

any cross-liking agent occurs much faster that when starting from chitosan solutions with 

different added amounts of GP and GT, as shown in Figure 4.5. Moreover, the maximum 

values of elastic modulus (G?) measured for this system are about two order of magnitude 

higher in comparison to the corresponding ones obtained from the chitosan solutions in the 

presence of the cross-liking agents. The estimated gelation times of chitosan solutions 

(Table  4.2) decrease with increasing added amounts of cross-liking agents. For a given 

cross-liking content, gelation times are always shorter for GT, confirming its enhanced 

reticulation ability in comparison to GP. No crossover point could be detected for the 

composite system within the experimental time frame along which G? and G?? were 

measured, suggesting that cross-linking has already occurred before starting the 

rheological measurements.

50 Results and Discussion 

 
 

The results showed that only relatively weak gels could be obtained by blending 2 wt.% 

chitosan solution with cross-linking agents up to 0.5 wt.%, while strong gels could be 

quickly achieved from the composite systems even in absence of cross-linking agents, 

although more efficiently in their presence. Therefore, it was concluded FastOs®BG-Z4 

powder has the ability to form complexes with dissociated chitosan molecules.  

Chitosan contains two different kinds of functional groups, hydroxyl (?OH) groups and 

amino (?NH2) groups, which are responsible for the reactivity of this polymer as an 

excellent natural adsorbent and give chitosan its powerful adsorptive capacity [76]. The 

surface adsorption mechanism would involve coulombic interactions between the positive 

amino groups of chitosan and the negative surface sites of FastOs®BG-Z4. Acidic pH is 

necessary for the protonation of amino (?NH3+) groups of chitosan. These protonated 

groups are likely to bind to the negatively charged surface FastOs®BG-Z4. On the other 

hand, hydroxyl (?OH) groups are also likely to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with 

the surface silanol groups of FastOs®BG-Z4 powders, thus contributing to strengthen the 

composite gels. But the most probable gel strengthening mechanism, in the case of 

chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 composite systems, is a cationic exchange between protonated 

amino groups of chitosan and cationic sites onto the surface of the bioactive glass particles 

and/or the cationic species leached out to the solution as sketched below: 

 

2	 ? ? 	+ 	 	? ? ? ? ? ? ?  (1) 

 

A similar cationic exchange mechanism could be hypothesised for the replacement of 

two hydronium ions from different chitosan ( ? ? ) molecules by a divalent cation, 

which would involve a decrease in pH of the media:  

 

? ? 	 + 	 ? ? 	 +		 	2 	 ? 	 ? ? ? ? ? ? 	 + 	2  (2) 

 

According to Rhazi et al. [77], the free amine function of chitosan confers it a better 

ability to chelate ions of transition metals. However, more investigations are required to

show further light on the reticulation mechanism involving the functional groups of 

chitosan and the surface of bioactive glass particles or the ionic species leached out to the 

solution.  

 

4.2 FTIR-ATR Spectroscopy Analysis 

 

Figure  4.6 shows the FTIR spectra within the 300–4000 cm?1 spectral range of 

FastOs®BG-Z4 powder, and of the chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 composite scaffolds reticulated 

without any added cross-linking agent, and with added 0.05 wt.% of GP or GT, all frozen 

at ?20ºC. The aim was to identify which functional groups of chitosan would be involved 

in the reticulation processes undergone in the different experimental processing conditions. 

Unfortunately, only the limited number of samples referred above could be analysed. The 

spectra of LA solution and of LA+chitosan solution without and with added cross-liking 

agents need to be performed in future studies.

52 Results and Discussion 

 
 

The FTIR spectrum of FastOs®BG-Z4 exhibits three broad bands in the region of ~ 500 

– 1300 cm?1. The most intense bands within the 600 – 1300 cm?1 region correspond to the 

stretching vibrations of the SiO4 tetrahedron with a different number of bridging oxygen 

atoms. The 800–1300 cm?1 region is split in two bands centred at ~1040 cm?1 and ~920 

cm?1, which can be assigned to the Si–O asymmetric stretching mode of BOs, and to the 

Si–O asymmetric stretching mode of the non-bridging oxygens (NBOs), respectively. 

Furthermore, the 510 cm?1 band can be attributed to Si–O–Si bending modes, while the 

weak 740 cm?1 shoulder may be due to Si–O–Si symmetric stretching with simultaneous Si 

cation motions. It is noteworthy that the band at 1040 cm?1 may also be assigned to the 

asymmetric stretching of PO4 units which has been reported to appear in crystalline 

fluorapatite at 1038 cm?1 [78]. 

The FTIR spectra of chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 composites exhibit characteristic bands of 

chitosan. The band in the region of 3400–3500 cm?1 corresponds to the stretching vibration 

of N?H peaks at around 3480 cm?1 and might be also be superimposed with the absorption 

band due to OH group. The peaks at around 2916 cm?1 and 2848 cm?1 are assigned to CH2 
and CH3 groups (aliphatic group). The bands at ~1660 cm?1 and ~1585 cm?1 are 

characteristic of respectively amide I and amide II, denoting the presence of acetyl group 

(?CH3?C=O), so these results confirm that chitosan is partially in deacetylated form. The 

peaks around 1420 cm?1 are assigned to the CH3 symmetrical deformation mode, and the 

peaks in the range of 1155 cm?1, 1097 cm?1 and 1043 cm?1 correspond to the C?O 

stretching vibrations. Table  4.3 summarizes the FTIR data, identifying the main vibration 

bands and the corresponding assigned functional groups. The mentioned characteristic 

bands are in good agreement with data previously reported [79] [80]. 

The spectra of chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 composite systems cross-linked with GP or GT 

also show similar absorption bands as those identified for the composite system in absence 

of cross-liking agents. This suggests that the most determinant reticulation mechanisms 

derive from the interactions between chitosan molecules and the surface of bioactive glass 

particles and/or the ionic species leached thereof, with the cross-linking agents GP and GT 

playing secondary roles. This main conclusion is consistent with the rheological results 

presented in Figure  4.1? Figure 4.5, and data reported in Table  4.1? Table 4.2.

4.3 Microstructural Analysis 

 

The microstructure of chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 composites without and with added 0.01, 

0.05, and 0.5 wt.% of GP or GT and frozen at ?20ºC are shown in Figure  4.7? Figure 4.8. 

The SEM micrographs show high porosity with almost interconnected spherical pores in 

irregular pattern. Both the cross-linking concentration and freezing temperature seemingly 

affected the final porous structures of the scaffolds. Irregular porosity is mostly caused by 

the freeze drying and sample preparation conditions. The pores are created by the ice 

crystals that sublimate during freeze drying, leaving gaps or pores in their place. The pore 

structure corresponds to the size and shape of the ice crystals.

56 Results and Discussion 

 
 

For composites cross-linked with GP and frozen at ?20ºC, Figure  4.7 shows that pore 

size gradually decreased from 118 ? 35 ?m for 0.01 wt.% GP to 74 ? 28 ?m for 0.5 wt.% 

GP, although the internal connectivity has been maintained. This evolution can be 

understood considering that an enhanced reticulation is likely to led to finer 3D porous 

network, and is in line with other findings reported before [73] [81]. However, there is not 

a complete consensus in these matters. For example, the groups of Bi [72] and Gorczyca 

[82] reported an increase of pore size with increasing amounts of added GP used to cross-

link chitosan-collagen scaffolds. Our observations when using GP also contrast with an 

opposite evolution observed for the composites cross-linked with GT (Figure 4.8) in which 

the pore size increased from 72 ? 16 ?m to 119 ? 30 ?m as the GT concentration increased 

from 0.01 to 0.5 wt.%. All these results suggest that the pore structure is affected not only 

by the type and added amount of cross-linking agent but also by other experimental factors 

such as reticulation and freezing temperatures for polymeric solutions, and the presence 

inorganic components or dissolves species, the separate effects of which need to be better 

understood. 

The effect of freezing temperature can be evaluated by comparing the SEM micrographs 

shown in Figure  4.9? Figure 4.10, which correspond to chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 composite 

scaffolds frozen at ?20ºC and ?80ºC, respectively. It is clear that scaffolds frozen at ?20ºC 

have a more opened and spaced structure. The formation of a highly closed tight network 

of scaffolds at ?80ºC could be explained as a result of faster gelation, which resulted in the 

formation of smaller ice crystals and restricted more their growth along the holding time at 

this temperature. At ?20ºC the growth of ice crystals is facilitated by the higher kinetic 

energy of water molecules for diffusion.

4.4 Cross-linking Degree Determination  

 

The chitosan/FostOs®BG-Z4 composite scaffolds cross-linked with GT exhibited a 

white colour, contrasting with the typical light bluish colour obtained for those cross-

linked with GP, especially with the highest added amount (GP50), as shown in Figure  4.11.

concentration of free amino (NH2) groups in the sample was determined from a standard

The results of cross-linking degrees determined by this method are reported in 

Table  4.4. It can be seen that cross-linking degrees increased with increasing added 

amounts of GP or GT. These results confirm that GP is a less efficient cross-linker in 

comparison to GT, in good consistency with the finding from rheological measurements. It 

can be also concluded that cross-linking degree was independent of freezing temperature, 

in agreement with similar observations reports elsewhere [83] [84].

With a deacetylation degree of chitosan ? 85%, mean that about 85% of the repeating 

units of a chitosan chain have an amine group. According to the results, neither GP nor GT 

did utilize all available amino groups at the tested concentrations and chitosan has not been 

completely cross-linked. However, GT is again confirmed to be the most efficient one. Its 

capability to cross-link amine containing polymers by forming amine–amine bonds, so-

called Schiff bases, to improved mechanical properties of scaffolds and decrease chitosan 

degradation in biological tissues has been widely acknowledged [85] [75]. The different 

cross-linking efficiencies might help explaining the differences observed in SEM 

micrographs of Figure 4.1? Fugure 4.5, and data reported in Table 4.1? Table 4.2.  

On the other hand, GP consisting of a simple aromatic ring is not likely to produce 

hydrophobic p-stacking interactions with chitosan and, consequently, has a lower 

capability to cross-link chitosan matrix in the tested condition as compared with GT [75]. 

Figure  4.13 shows the schematics of chitosan cross-linking with GP and GT under near 

neutral conditions (pH ~ 6.8) [75].

62 Results and Discussion 

 
 

According to Kil’deeva et al. [80], the reactivity of GT with amino groups of chitosan is 

different at different pH values. They have shown that in weakly acidic and neutral 

solutions (pH 3.0–7.2), no oligomerization is promoted by GT. At pH ? 5.6, the 

dissociation of a proton from the OCHCH2 leads to the formation of an anion, the first 

stage of the aldol reaction. In a weakly alkaline medium (pH &gt; 7.2) such as in the present 

work, GT is polymerized and the products of the aldol reaction and aldol condensation are 

formed, in which the polymerization rate increases with the concentration of hydroxyl ions. 

Increasing the pH value above 10 leads to the formation of water-soluble and -insoluble 

polymeric products of the aldol reaction and the condensation of GT. 

In fact, the crosslinking is facilitated by formation of many irregular oligomeric 

glutaraldehyde molecules in which one aldehyde group of glutaraldehyde can react with 

chitosan while the other aldehyde group can undergo polymerization and eventually form 

bonds with other chitosan molecules. The mechanism leads to formation of a cross-linked 

structure with longer intermolecular chain lengths than would have been expected from 

monomeric glutaraldehyde. Formation of self-polymerized glutaraldehyde compounds, and 

their influence on chitosan cross-linked structures has been reported in details in some 

previous works [80] [86]. 

The cross-linking reaction mechanisms for chitosan with GP are also pH dependent. 

Under acidic and neutral conditions, a nucleophilic attack by the amino groups of chitosan 

on the olefinic carbon atom at C-3 occurs, followed by opening the dihydropyran ring of 

GP and attacked by the secondary amino group on the newly formed aldehyde group. In 

the product, short chains of condensed GP act as cross-linking bridges. Under basic 

conditions, the ring-opening reaction of GP occurs via a nucleophilic attack by hydroxyl 

ions in aqueous solution to form intermediate aldehyde groups, which subsequently 

undergo aldol condensation. The terminal aldehyde groups on the polymerized GP undergo 

a Schiff reaction with the amino groups on chitosan to form cross-linked networks. 

Therefore, the pH condition plays an important role in influencing the cross-linking 

reactions [87], which is linked to the available number of free amino groups in solution.  

Under acidic environments the amino groups are essentially protonated and their 

participation in cross-linking process is more limited. As pH of solution increases, the 

number of free amino groups also increases leading to a consequent reduction in gelation 

time. This phenomenon is true for both GT and GP.

4.5 Pore Size and Porosity Measurement 

 

In this study, pore sizes and porosity fractions of the composite scaffolds were 

evaluated using cylindrical samples of (2.4 cm diameter × 0.9 cm height) immersed into 

ethanol. The porosity values reported in Table  4.5 vary within the range of 80-92% 

depending on freezing temperature and cross-liking agent used.

The lowest values were obtained for composite scaffolds reticulated without any added 

cross-liking agents, followed successively by those cross-liked with GT and GP. These 

results are very consistent with other data reported above, namely the obtained by 

rheological measurements (Figure 4.1? Figure 4.5, and Tables 4.1? Table 4.2) and cross-

liking degrees (Table  4.4). All these results point out to an apparent enhanced reticulation 

efficiency of chitosan with added FastOs®BG-Z4 powder in comparison to the chitosan 

solutions with added GT and GP. For an easier visualization, the porosity data of 

composites scaffolds cross-linked with GP and GT have also been plotted in Figure  4.14 to 

Figure 4.17 aiming at better comparing the separate effects of cross-likers and freezing 

temperatures.

less porous in comparison to the samples frozen at ?20ºC, an observation that is consistent 

with the more favourable temperature induced growing of ice crystals at ?20ºC, and with 

the microstructural features observed in SEM micrographs (Figure  4.7 to Figure  4.10). The 

overall results observed in the present work are in good agreement with findings reported 

by Shirosaki [88], Ren [89], Kang [90] and Ho [91]. 

The larger pores will provide space for the migration of cells and to improve the 

diffusion of nutrients and metabolites throughout the membrane [81]. Some reports point 

out that multi-channel conduits with relatively higher porosity and greater average channel 

diameters could provide a more permissive environment for axonal ingrowth than those 

having lower porosity and smaller average channel diameters [92] [93]. The adhesion and 

proliferation of cells are influenced by porosity so this is a decisive factor for absorption 

ability of scaffolds. High porosity and interconnectivity pore structure are necessary for 

tissue-guided scaffold materials. The pore diameter should be in the range of cell diameters 

to enable cell infiltration and vascularization of the scaffold [94]. Chitosan membranes 

with about 90% porosity and average pore size of ~110 ?m were reported to significantly 

improve nerve fibre regeneration and the degree of functional recovery [95]. In other study 

done by Wan et al. [96] the porosity and average channel diameter of the conduits were 

respectively set as around 80% and 200 ?m by controlling processing parameters with 

required mechanical strength and degradation rates. In addition, it has also been observed 

that the channels inside conduits would be blocked due to swelling of the conduits if the 

channel diameters are too small, resulting in no nerve growth in the blocked conduits [93].

4.6 Mechanical Properties 

 

Hydrated porous chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 composite scaffolds were soft, spongy and 

very flexible. No maximum compression strength was obtained because the scaffolds did 

not break when subject to compression up to strain values of ~60%, the maximum value 

used for all the samples. The date plotted in Figure  4.18? Figure  4.21 are intended to 

convey an easy visualization of the separate effects of added cross-likers and freezing 

temperatures on the mechanical properties of chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 composite scaffolds.  

Generally, the mechanical compressive strength values of the cross-linked chitosan 

scaffolds always increases with increasing added amounts of cross-linking. The only 

exception was observed for the highest added amount of GT. This deviation from the main 

trend can be attributed to the concomitant increase of the average size of pores formed 

under these conditions. The smaller average pore sizes formed in samples frozen at ?80ºC 

can also explain the systematically higher compressive strength values registered for these 

samples in comparison to those obtained from samples frozen at ?20ºC. The same 

argument is also valid when comparing the compressive strength values of composite 

scaffolds reticulated with different cross-linking agents. The higher percentages of porosity 

measured for scaffolds cross-linked with GP (Table  4.6), coupled with the larger pores 

observed for these scaffolds (Figure  4.7 and Figure  4.8) support the registered compressive 

strength data plotted in Figure  4.18?  Figure 4.21.

70 Results and Discussion 

 
 

Another interesting and expected feature is the increasing trend observed for 

compressive strength with increasing strains. To better illustrate such evolution 

compressive strength values were registered for all composite scaffolds at strains of 20%, 

40%, and 60%. The date was plotted in Figure  4.22? Figure  4.25. These results confirm the 

above referred general increasing trend of compressive strength with increasing added 

amounts of cross-liking agents, at both freezing temperatures (?20ºC and ?80ºC), with the 

exception of the highest amount of GT (Figure  4.24 and Figure 4.25) that led to the 

formation of larger pores as confirmed by the SEM micrographs (Figure  4.8 and Figure 

4.10).

Many factors affect the gelling time and the final structural and mechanical properties 

of scaffolds made of polymers or of composite systems, including the concentration of 

constituting components and of cross-linking agents, the solvent composition, the 

processing (cross-linking and freezing temperatures), etc. [97] [98] [99]. The results 

reported above and in previous literature reports clearly indicate that compressive strength 

of porous scaffolds is mainly dependent on pore structure. The same arguments are valid 

for the elastic modulus values that were plotted in (Figure  4.26 to Figure 4.29).

It seems consensual that smaller pores and higher cross-linking degrees are helpful to 

enhance the biomechanical strength engineered constructs [72]. It is also recognized that 

appropriate mechanical properties are required for nerve scaffolds to remain intact during a 

suture process and provide a temporary mechanical support sufficient to withstand in vivo

forces exerted by the surrounding tissues [100]. Hence, in order to yield ideal polymer 

scaffolds, the optimal crosslinking condition should be investigated.  

Nerve conduits with enough mechanical properties will resist muscular contractions and 

maintain structural support with enough space and stability to facilitate nerve regeneration 

[35]. The enhanced mechanical properties of chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 composite 

membranes will allow better shape stability in comparison to those made from chitosan 

alone, making them more promising for these biomedical applications. 

 

4.7 Swelling Behaviours 

 

The swelling ratio is an important index used to evaluate the structural stability of a 

biodegradable scaffold. The swelling should be moderate. If too great, the scaffold will 

swell much in vivo, decreasing the available space the biological processes to occur within 

the scaffold. If too poor, it will cause local hydropenia at the implanting site [49]. As 

shown in Figure  4.30 to Figure  4.33, the scaffolds with added cross-linking agents exhibit 

a higher swelling capacity in comparison to that obtained without cross-linkers.

Figure  4.33. Swelling ratio of chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 composite scaffolds cross-

linked without and with different added amounts of GT, frozen at ?80ºC.  

 

 

The swelling data plotted in Figure  4.30 to Figure  4.33 show an abrupt initial increase 

of PBS solution uptake followed by an accentuated decreasing trend up to about 3 h, and 

then by a slow and steadily decreasing along the remaining testing time interval (up to 24 

h). It can be seen that the less swelling capacity was obtained in the absence of cross-liking 

agents, followed by the samples with the highest amounts of GP and GT. The differences 

observed among the samples are consistent with the measured percentages of porosity 

(Table 4.5). In addition, the volume or shape of all scaffolds scarcely changed during 

soaking in PBS. The scaffolds absorbed PBS solution without collapsing of the 3D pore 

structure. 

The swelling properties of porous chitosan-based scaffolds can be understood based on 

the hydrophilic and cationic character of this polymer. Besides porosity, cross-linking of 

chitosan can also change its hydrophilicity, which, in turn will further decrease the 

swelling ratio scaffold [101]. Therefore, it can be concluded that the swelling behaviour of 

the composite chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 membranes and their mechanical stability are 

mostly determined by the porous structure and the relevant factors behind it (the kind and 

the added amount of cross-linker, and processing temperatures). Similar conclusions were 

drawn by Bi et al. group [72] for chitosan scaffolds.

4.8 Degradation Behaviours 

 

The degradation rate is another important index for the evaluation of scaffolds. The 

weight loss (WL) of the chitosan/Fastos®BG-Z4 composite scaffold without any added 

cross-linking agent was used as a control to compare with the others cross-linked with 

different added amounts of GP or GT. 

The WL data of all the chitosan/Fastos®BG-Z4 composite scaffolds are presented in 

Figure  4.34 to Figure  4.37 as a function of immersion time.

Figure  4.37. Percentage of weight loss for chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 composite scaffolds cross-

. 

 

From these Figure 4.34? Figure 4.37, it can be seen that the degradation rates decrease 

with increasing added amounts of cross-linking agents at constant pH = 7.4, with the 

highest values being observed for the control sample reticulated without any added cross-

linker. Another important conclusion is that degradation rates are systematically slower for 

samples frozen at the lower freezing temperature (?80ºC).  

This expected behaviour is eventually more easily observed when degradation data of 

chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 composite scaffolds cross-linked with GP or GT, collected after 

soaking for 8 weeks in PBS solution is plotted against the added amounts of cross-linking 

agents, as shown in Figure  4.38 and Figure  4.39.  

The results observed are according to the cross-linking degree detected by the NHN 

assay. The higher crosslinking degrees promoted by GT (Table  4.4) resulted in systematic 

lower weight losses. Regardless of the presence, or not, of cross-linking agents and of the 

weight losses undergone, all composite scaffolds maintained their structural integrity, an 

essential feature for successful applications in nerve repair.

Conclusions 83 
 

 
 

 

The results obtained along this Master thesis project enable a number of conclusions to 

be drawn, the most salient one is the disclosure for the first time that self-setting 

chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 porous composite scaffolds/membranes can be prepared by just 

adding the bioactive glass particles to the chitosan solutions. Although the 

setting/reticulation mechanism still demands further investigations to become fully 

understood, it was hypothesized that both active sites at the surface of bioactive glass 

particles and the ionic species leached off to the solution are likely to play a cross-liking 

role. These amazing findings mean that the use of potentially cytotoxic cross-linkers such 

as GT can be avoided, thus making the membranes for nerve regeneration innocuous and 

bio-friendly.  

Besides this main important achievement, several other specific conclusions can be 

drawn from the present work as detailed below: 

 

1. The naturally occurring genipin (GP) and the traditional synthetic glutaraldehyde 

(GT) revealed to be suitable cross-linkers for making 3D composite 

chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 porous membranes for nerve regeneration. The cross-linking 

efficiency and the consequent mechanical stability are generally higher in the case of 

GT in comparison to GP, except for the highest added amount of GT.  

 

2. The enhanced cross-linking efficiency of GT resulted in higher cross-linking 

degrees and systematic lower percentages of porosity and swelling ratios, and slower 

degradation rates upon immersion in PBS solution, as expressed by the undergone 

weight losses along a time period of 8 weeks. Accordingly, the higher degradation rates 

were observed for the self-reticulated porous chitosan/FastOs®BG-Z4 composite 

membranes. 

 

3. For both cross-linking agents used, the cross-linking degree always increased with 

the added amounts, within the range of concentrations tested, with direct reflexes in 

terms of the overall properties of the resulting scaffolds. 



84 Conclusions 
 

 
 

4. The lower freezing temperature (?80ºC) revealed to be more effective in decreasing 

the pore size and porosity fraction, thus enhancing the mechanical properties and the 

stability of the scaffolds when submitted to swelling and degradation tests.  

 

5. The freezing temperature of ?20ºC was selected as the most suitable one when 

considering the porous microstructural features and the intended applications. 

 

6. Regardless of the presence, or not, of cross-linking agents and of the weight losses 

undergone, all composite scaffolds maintained their structural integrity, an essential 

feature for successful applications in nerve repair.

86 Future Work 
 

 
 

 

The most salient finding of the present work opened further research avenues that need 

to be explored in future studies. The self-reticulation mechanism of chitosan/Fastos®BG-

Z4 needs to be investigated in detail in order to clarify the relative importance of the 

surface chemistry of the bioactive glass particles and of the dissolves ionic species. It 

would be also important studying the influence of different chitosan/Fastos®BG-Z4 weight 

ratios on the gelation process and on the overall properties of the resulting scaffolds.  

Obviously, testing the scaffolds in vitro for cytotoxicity, biocompatibility and cell 

proliferation, and in vivo are essential steps to be conducted in the future to evaluate the 

suitability of the composite membranes for the intended clinical applications as nerve 

guides in peripheral nerve regeneration.
