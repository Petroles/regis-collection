ABSTRACT

In this work we investigated the structure of the iron-stimulated surface tension reducing substances produced
by P. citronellolis 222A isolated from a 17-years old landfarming used for sludge treatment in petrochemical
industries and oil refinery. Its mass spectrum differs from P. aeruginosa spectrum, indicating that the surface
tension reducing substances produced by P. citronellolis can be a new kind of biosurfactant.

Key words: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, rhamnolipid mixture, ESI mass spectrum, biosurfactant

We have recently reported a bacterial isolate Pseudomonas
citronellolis 222A as a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-
degrading bacteria and biosurfactant producer (6). This bacterium
belongs to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa group, from the
Pseudomonadaceae family and it was initially reported by Seubert
(12) as an isoprenoid-degrading bacterium. More recently, P.
citronellolis was isolated from soil as a hydrocarbon-degrading
bacterial strain, which metabolizes citronellol (isoprenoid) and
can also degrade the toxic hydrocarbon constituents present in
oily sludge (3). In a further study we reported that P. citronellolis
222A showed the highest reduction of surface tension as
compared with P. aeruginosa isolates and the addition of a
soluble source of iron decreased surface tension (11). P.
citronellolis 222A isolate showed a direct dependence on iron
to stimulate surface tension reducing substances production
that increased anthracene biodegradation (11). For Bacillus
subtilis, Wei and Chu (13) reported that supplementation of iron
enabled overproduction of a biosurfactant surfactin and
increased biomass growth of this bacterium in a dose dependent
manner. More recently, Wei et al. (14) verified addition of iron
sulfate increased markedly surfactin production initially, but
further iron addition led to a decrease in the concentration of
surfactin, most likely due to acidification of the culture and

consequent precipitation of surfactin. To our knowledge, the
work of Santos et al., (11) showing the effect of iron on surfactant
production by a Pseudomonas citronellolis was firstly reported
on the literature. Despite that P. citronellolis belongs to the
Pseudomonas aeruginosa group, we are considering the
presence of a different surfactant structure as compared to the
rhamnolipid produced by P. aeruginosa sp. In this work, we did
the investigation on the structure of the iron-stimulated surface
tension reducing substances produced by P. citronellolis 222A
as compared to the structure of rhamolipid produced by P.
aeruginosa LBI isolated from a petroleum-contaminated soil.

Pseudomonas citronellolis (isolate 222A) is a PAH-
degrading bacteria and biosurfactant producer identified by
16S rRNA gene sequencing by Jacques et al. (6). It was isolated
from 17-years old soil that was used for sludge treatment from
petrochemical industries and oil refinery. P. aeruginosa LBI
was isolated from petroleum-contaminated soil as previously
characterized by Benincasa et al. (1) and its surfactant was
used for structure comparison. For surfactant production, the
isolate 222A was inoculated with an initial population of 2.0±0.2
Log CFU mL-1 in mineral medium (MM) (50 mL) as described by
Jacques et al. (6), containing 250 mg L-1 of anthracene (three
replicates) in the absence (control) and presence of 0.1 mM

Fe(NO3)3 and incubated at 30ºC for 48 days with orbital shaking
(150 rpm). Surfactant production was estimated by the
emulsification index and by the reduction of the surface tension.
Emulsification evaluation was performed by the presence and
absence of cells into the MM (cells were removed by
centrifugation at 10,000 rpm by 30 min, at 4ºC). Two mL of MM
were mixed with diesel oil in a pirex glass tube (100 mm x 15 mm)
using a vortex for 2 minutes. After that, the tubes were kept
resting for 24 hours and then the volume and the stability of the
emulsion were measured. The surface tension of the MM was
measured in the absence of cells after samples equilibration (1h
at 25ºC), using a model Lecont Du Nouy tensiometer. Sterile
mineral medium was used as control (69.2 mM m-1). Surface
tension reducing substances were extracted from culture media
after cell removal by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 20 min. The
supernatant pH was adjusted to 2.0 with 6N H2SO4, and an
equal volume of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) was added. The mixture
was vigorously shaken for 5 min and allowed to set until phase
separation. The organic phase was removed and the operation
was repeated. The extracted product was concentrated from
the pooled organic phases using a rotary evaporator. The
viscous yellowish product obtained was dissolved in methanol
and concentrated again by evaporation of the solvent at 45ºC,
according to Costa et al. (4). Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass
spectra were recorded on a high-resolution Q-Tof (Micromass,
U.K.) mass spectrometer with a quadrupole (Qq) orthogonal
time-of-flight configuration using operating conditions
described in details elsewhere (4). The ESI mass spectrum in
the negative ion mode was acquired using a capillary voltage of
-3.5 kV, a cone voltage of 35 V and desolvatation gas (nitrogen)
was heated to 100ºC. ESI tandem mass spectra were acquired
by mass-selecting the target ion using the quadrupole mass
analyzer followed by 25eV, collision induced dissociation using
nitrogen in collision cell. The material was dissolved in methanol:
water (1:1 v/v), filtered (0.22 mm) and introduced into the source
at 15 ml min-1 with a syringe pump.

After 48 days of incubation into mineral medium containing
250 mg L-1 of anthracene P. citronellolis 222A isolate reduced
surface tension from 69.2 to 36.2 mM m-1. Addition of 0.1 mM of
Fe-Fe(NO3)3 to the medium increased the reduction of surface
tension to 26.0 mM m-1, as reported by Santos et al. (11), being
one of the smallest values reported in the literature, only compared
to the surfactin produced by B. subtilis (14). This reduction was
associated to the increase of the anthracene availability and
consequently, increase of anthracene degradation (28%)
estimated by gas chromatography (CG-MS), as compared with
the result in the absence of iron. Beyond anthracene, iron addition
at 0.1 mM Fe(NO3)3 increased the growth of the P. citronellolis
222A isolate living into a medium containing pyrene, phenantrene,
gasoline and diesel oil. Emulsification was not detected in our
work, indicating that the P. citronellolis 222A do not produce
high molecular weight surfactant as a bioemulsificant.

Mass spectroscopy analysis of the rhamnolipid produced
by P. aeruginosa LBI yielded an ESI mass spectrum with a
predominant peak at m/z 649 and a second major component at
m/z 503, which corresponds to the deprotonated molecules [M-
H]– of the dirhamnolipid (Rha2C10C10) and the monorhamnolipid
(RhaC10C10), respectively (Figure 1A). These are biosurfactants
frequently produced by P. aeruginosa and more studied and
found in literature (1,4,5,8). In fact, ESI-MS detected a
rhamnolipid mixture produced by this Pseudomonas with the
presence of other components (m/z 621, m/z 677) (Fig. 1A).
Pseudo-molecular ions above 621 probably represent fragments
of the molecules of monorhamnolipids and dirhamnolipid (9). P.
aeruginosa frequently produce a mixture of biosurfactants.
Déziel et al. (5) identified the presence of the 21 types of
rhamnolipids when P. aeruginosa 57RP grew using mannitol as
unique source of carbon.

In our work, the same situation was observed with P.
citronellolis 222A which also produced a mixture of substances
with surface tension reducing proprieties (Fig. 1B). The
substances extraction was not possible in the presence of iron,
probably due to some chemical interference on extraction. In
the absence of iron, the ESI-MS analysis of the reducing surface
tension substances mixtures produced by P. citronellolis 222A
revealed compounds of small m/z. The major component was
pseudo-molecular ions at m/z 341 and two higher peaks detected
as the anions of m/z 339 and 255; this indicates a production of
components differents of P. aeruginosa pattern. Microorganisms
synthesize a wide variety of low-molecular-mass biosurfactants
(10). They are mainly rhamnolipids, trehaloselipids,
sophorolipids, viscosin, surfactin, gramicidins, polymyxins,
serrawettin, lipopeptides (10). However, bacterial cells can
produce a large variety of surface tension reducing substances
such as peptides, fatty acids, phospholipids and also antibiotics,
that have low molecular mass than the named low-molecular-
mass biosurfactants (7). In the ESI mass spectrum produced by
P. citronellolis 222A it is possible to find structures similar to
rhamnolipids produced by P. aeruginosa, as the anion of m/z
311 corresponds to a molecule with two rhamnoses (Rha2) could
indicate a production of dirhamnolipids by P. citronellolis (2).

Variations in the chemical structure of biosurfactants have
been reported by several authors (1,7,10). These variations are
obviously associated to species of bacteria that produce the
biosurfactant, as well as variations in analytical methodologies
used to characterize the molecules and growth conditions (5,9).
Deziel et al. (5) show that the rhamnolipids produced by P.
aeruginosa 57RP differs both in quantity and in structure
depending on if the carbon source in mineral medium was
mannitol or naphthalene. The most of the works in the literature
use glycerol or vegetable oils (soybean, olive, sunflower, corn)
as unique source of carbon to grow biosurfactant-producing
microorganisms. To our knowledge, this is the first report about
the structural characterization of surface tension reducing

substances produced in anthracene. This in part could explain
the differences between ESI mass spectrum of P. aeruginosa
and P. citronellolis. It was observed that surface tension
reducing substances produced by P. citronellolis structurally
seem to be different of typical rhamnolipids produced by P.
aeruginosa, which indicates the necessity of new studies
(nuclear magnetic resonance, for example) aiming to identify
completely the structures of these substances, which can be a
new kind of biosurfactant.
