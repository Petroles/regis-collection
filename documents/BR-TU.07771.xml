Abstract 

 

Plasmids are autonomously replicating entities that can be found in all bacterial species and 

contribute for bacterial adaption and evolution. The demand of highly purified biomolecules 

has triggered the development of new separation technologies. Herein, plasmid DNA (pDNA) 

purification process has been extensively investigated, in order to obtain highly purified 

molecules for gene therapy applications and DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) vaccines. The 

purification of plasmid DNA is currently performed by different techniques, namely 

chromatography (anion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction, reversed phase, affinity and size-

exclusion), enzymatic and membrane processes. Membrane technology is a broad and highly 

interdisciplinary field, where process engineering, material science and chemistry meet to 

produce membranes that have a wide range of applications, such as water, biomolecules and 

plasmid DNA purification. Furthermore, membrane systems take advantage of their selectivity, 

high surface-area-per-unit-volume. Herein, the main goal was to produce membrane systems - 

electrospinning membranes: poly ?-caprolactone, polyethylene oxide and k-carrageenan; 

modified-nylon membranes: nylon membrane impregnated with agarose - in order to perform 

microfiltration and ultrafiltration processes, respectively. The produced membranes were 

characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy, Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier 

Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy. The water contact angles 

were also determined and the results obtained showed that the produced membranes presented 

a hydrophilic character, which is in agreement with the date previously described in literature. 

Porosity studies were also performed and the results demonstrated that the electrospun 

membranes have porosity around to 80% and the modified-nylon membranes have porosities of 

approximately 40%. These values can be considered to be very high, when comparing these 

membranes to conventional microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes produced by phase 

inversion. The plasmid DNA rejection was determined on the membranes produced and the 

experimental results showed that the modified-nylon membrane presented rejection values up 

to 100%, depending on the imposed permeate flux, which is an attractive feature for its 

application on plasmid DNA purification by ultrafiltration. In respect to the electrospun 

membranes produced the observed rejections were found to be lower, up to 30%, which 

demonstrates that this membranes need to be optimized or modified (post-synthesis 

modification).

Resumo 

 

Os plasmídeos são entidades auto-replicantes que podem ser encontrados em todas as espécies 

de bactérias e que têm um papel fundamental na adaptação e evolução das bactérias. A 

necessidade de obter biomoléculas com um elevado grau de pureza desencadeou o 

desenvolvimento de novas técnicas de separação. Os processos de optimização da purificação 

de ADN plasmídico têm sido estudados exaustivamente, para que estes possam ser usados em 

aplicações de terapia génica ou em vacinas de ADN (ácido desoxirribonucleico). A purificação 

do ADN plasmídico tem sido realizada usando, nomeadamente a tecnologia de membranas. A 

tecnologia de membranas abrange uma vasta área do conhecimento, altamente 

interdisciplinar, onde engenharia de processos, a ciência dos materiais e a química permitem 

a produção de membranas aplicadas em diferentes áreas, tais como purificação de águas, 

biomoléculas e de ADN plasmídico, entre muitas outras. Os sistemas de separação com 

membranas caracterizam-se por oferecer geralmente elevada selectividade nas separações, 

elevadas áreas superficiais por unidade de volume do equipamento; e oferecem a possibilidade 

de controlar o nível de contacto e/ou mistura entre duas fases. O presente estudo teve como 

objectivo produzir membranas de micro e ultrafiltração para purificação de ADN plasmídico - 

membranas de electrospinning: poli ?-caprolactona, óxido de polietileno e k-carragenano; 

membranas de nylon modificadas: membrana nylon impregnada com agarose. As membranas 

produzidas foram caracterizadas por Microscopia Electrónica de Varrimento, Espectroscopia de 

Infravermelho com Transformada de Fourier Atenuada e Espectroscopia de Raio X por Dispersão 

de Energia. Os ângulos de contacto com água também foram determinados e os resultados 

obtidos mostraram que as membranas produzidas apresentam caracter hidrofílico. Estudos de 

porosidade foram igualmente efectuados e os resultados demonstraram que as membranas 

produzidas por electrospinning têm porosidades próximas de 80% e a membrana de nylon 

modificada tem uma porosidade próxima de 40%. Estes valores podem ser considerados bastante 

elevados, se os compararmos com valores típicos de membranas de microfiltração e 

ultrafiltração convencionais, produzidas por inversão de fase. A rejeição de ADN plasmídico foi 

determinada para ambas as membranas. Os valores obtidos mostraram que a membrana de 

nylon modificada apresentou valores de rejeição até 100%, dependendo do fluxo de permeação 

imposto, o que é uma característica promissora para a sua aplicação em purificação de ADN 

plasmídico por ultrafiltração. Relativamente às membranas produzidas por electrospinning a 

rejeição foi menor, apenas até 30%, o que demonstra que estas membranas precisam ser 

optimizadas ou eventualmente modificadas (modificação por síntese).

Resumo Alargado 

 

Os plasmídeos são entidades auto-replicantes que podem ser encontrados em todas as espécies 

de bactérias e que têm um papel fundamental na adaptação e evolução das bactérias. Além 

disso, os plasmídeos são estudados devido às suas propriedades intrínsecas, o que os torna 

importantes ferramentas nos estudos de biologia molecular. Os processos de optimização do 

ADN plasmídico têm sido estudados exaustivamente, para que estes possam ser usados em 

aplicações de terapia génica ou em vacinas de ADN (ácido desoxirribonucleico). A necessidade 

de obter biomoléculas com um elevado grau de pureza desencadeou o desenvolvimento de 

novas técnicas de separação. A evolução da terapia génica alcançou um importante marco 

histórico, nomeadamente, a autorização da EMA (European Medicines Agency) para a 

comercialização de um fármaco de terapia génica para o tratamento da deficiência da 

lipoproteína lipase. A purificação do ADN plasmídico tem sido realizada usando várias técnicas, 

tais como, cromatografia (troca iónica, interacção hidrofóbica, fase reversa, afinidade e 

exclusão molecular), enzimática e processos de membrana. Nos processos reportados na 

literatura, os plasmídeos são produzidos por via fermentativa e subsequente processo de 

purificação; este divide-se em três etapas: recuperação primária, recuperação intermediária e 

purificação final. A tecnologia de membranas abrange uma vasta área do conhecimento, 

altamente interdisciplinar, onde engenharia de processos, a ciência dos materiais e a química 

permitem a produção de membranas aplicadas em diferentes áreas, tais como purificação de 

ADN plasmídico. Os sistemas de filtração com membranas são apropriados para o processamento 

de moléculas biológicas, uma vez que operam, relativamente, a baixas temperaturas e pressões 

e não envolvem mudanças de fases, minimizando o grau de desnaturação, desactivação e/ou 

degradação dos produtos biológicos; além disso, não requerem o consumo de grandes 

quantidades de agentes químicos, por se tratar de processos puramente físicos. A filtração com 

membranas tem também normalmente baixos custos operatórios comparando com outros 

processos alternativos. Além disso, a filtração com membranas permite elevadas selectividades 

e elevada produtividade, sendo os sistemas bastante compactos, dada a elevada área 

superficial por unidade de volume dos módulos industriais. Os processos de filtração com 

membranas podem ser classificados tendo em conta diferentes características das membranas, 

nomeadamente o tamanho do poro, tamanho e carga das partículas ou moléculas retidas e a 

pressão exercida na membrana. Esta classificação permite distinguir as membranas de 

microfiltração, ultrafiltração, nanofiltração e osmose reversa. No caso da microfiltração e 

ultrafiltração a separação molecular é baseada essencialmente nas diferenças de tamanho das 

moléculas, forma e diferenças de flexibilidade estrutural. O electrospinning é um método fácil 

e barato de produzir materiais nanofibrosos. A simplicidade deste processo e a vasta gama de 

aplicações encontrada, incluindo engenharia de tecidos, sensores e biossensores e filtração são 

importantes factores que levam a um interesse progressivo no desenvolvimento de novos tipos

de membranas nanofibrosas produzidas por electrospinning. Este tipo de membranas oferece 

um conjunto de vantagens na filtração, principalmente pela elevada porosidade das membranas 

(tipicamente à volta de 80%) e a elevada razão de área de superfície/volume (devido à elevada 

área superficial das fibras), quando comparados com membranas poliméricas convencionais 

obtidas por inversão de fase e membranas cerâmicas. A elevada porosidade pode melhorar 

directamente o fluxo sem prejudicar a taxa de rejeição dos contaminantes e a elevada razão 

área/volume permite tirar partido de possíveis interacções físicas soluto/membrana que 

possam ser úteis nas separações e/ou no controlo da colmatação. Actualmente existem várias 

membranas de ultrafiltração disponíveis no mercado que podem ser usadas para a purificação 

de ADN plasmídico. Tendo em conta o tamanho das moléculas do ADN plasmídico, a modificação 

da superfície de membranas de microfiltração aparece como uma possível alternativa, 

oferecendo a possibilidade de ajustar a selectividade desejada a um caso particular. Vários 

estudos têm demonstrado que as propriedades da membrana, tais como resistência às 

proteínas, biocompatibilidade, carga e hidrofobicidade, podem ser melhoradas através de 

processos de modificação da superfície. No presente estudo pretendeu-se produzir membranas 

de microfiltração e de ultrafiltração para purificação de ADN plasmídico - membranas 

produzidas por electrospinning: poli ?-caprolactona, óxido de polietileno e k-carragenano; 

membranas de nylon modificadas: membranas de nylon impregnadas com agarose. As 

membranas produzidas foram caracterizadas por Microscopia Electrónica de Varrimento, 

Espectroscopia de Infravermelho com Transformada de Fourier Atenuada, Espectroscopia de 

Raio X por Dispersão de Energia. Os ângulos de contacto com água também foram determinados 

e os resultados obtidos mostraram que as membranas produzidas apresentavam caracter 

hidrofílico. Estudos de porosidade foram igualmente efectuados e os resultados demonstraram 

que as membranas produzidas por electrospinning têm porosidades próximas de 80% e a 

membrana de nylon modificada tem uma porosidade próxima de 40%. Estes valores podem ser 

considerados bastante elevados, se os compararmos com valores típicos de membranas de 

microfiltração e ultrafiltração convencionais, produzidas por inversão de fase. A rejeição de 

ADN plasmídico foi determinada para ambas as membranas. Os valores obtidos mostraram que 

a membrana de nylon modificada apresentou valores de rejeição até 100%, dependendo do 

fluxo de permeação imposto, o que é uma característica promissora para a sua aplicação em 

purificação de ADN plasmídico por ultrafiltração. Relativamente às membranas produzidas por 

electrospinning a rejeição foi menor, apenas até 30%, o que demonstra que estas membranas 

precisam ser optimizadas ou eventualmente modificadas (modificação pós-síntese).

1. Introduction 

 

1.1 Plasmid DNA 

Plasmids are autonomously replicating entities which can be found essentially in all bacterial 

species and that play a significant role in bacterial adaptation and evolution [1]. Like 

chromosomes, plasmids code for ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules and proteins, replicate as 

cell grows and equal numbers are normally distributed to the two daughter cells upon cell 

division [1]. Plasmids are studied due to their intrinsic properties and serve as important tools 

in molecular biology studies [1], for instance, they have been used as vectors for gene therapy 

or vaccination in the last two decades [2-4]. The injection of plasmid DNA (pDNA) containing 

selected genes from pathogens can induce a protective immune response [5]. In previous studies 

it has been demonstrated that pDNA vaccines can simulate intracellular pathogen gene 

expression pathways, but are quiet safe due to a lack genetic integration, i.e. the injected 

foreign genetic material will not be integrated in the host genetic material and, therefore, it 

will not be responsible for an immune response in the host [6, 7]. 

The demand of highly purified biomolecules has triggered the development of new separation 

technologies. Herein, the plasmid DNA purification has been extensively investigated, in order 

to obtain a highly purified molecules for gene therapy applications and deoxyribonucleic acid 

(DNA) vaccines [8]. The evolution of gene therapy achieved an important landmark, namely, 

the authorization of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the commercialisation, in the 

European Union, of Glybera (alipogene tiparvovec) for gene therapy, to treat the lipoprotein 

lipase deficiency [9]. In literature there are different studies focused on this topic [1, 9-11] and 

the formulation of DNA vaccines [12-14] has the encouraging results shown in autoimmune 

diseases such as AIDS, and due to the other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis B and C, and 

tuberculosis [6, 7]. 

 

1.1.2 Purification methods 

The final pDNA solution must strictly obey to the safety regulations imposed by the Food and 

Drug Administration (FDA) and/or EMA, known as Good Manufacture Products (GMP) [6]. They 

establish thresholds for the presence of contaminants, including harmful chemicals (cesium 

chloride, ethidium bromide, isopropanol, phenol or chloroform) and enzymes (RNase A, 

lysozyme and proteinase K), which are used in laboratory protocols and are considered unsafe 

or impractical, when inserted into large scale operations [15-18]. 

The purification of pDNA has been achieved through the use of different techniques, including 

chromatography (anion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction, reversed phase, affinity and size-

exclusion), enzymatic and membrane processes [19-23]. Figure 1 shows a scheme of pDNA 

purification process adapted from Prazeres et al [19], in which the authors refer the main steps 

of pDNA purification process, from cell lysis to the final product purification and formulation, 

dividing it into three stages: primary recovery, intermediate recovery and final purification. It 

also can be seen in Figure 1 that microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) can be used in 

most of the different phases of the process. 

Primary recovery essentially consists in cell harvesting, cell disruption and the removal of cell 

debris from the main stream. In the intermediate recovery a more thorough purification is 

performed, removing genomic DNA, RNA, proteins, endotoxins and concentrating the pDNA. 

The final purification is the most important step, because it leads to a pure pDNA, free of 

contaminants; in this step the remains of genomic DNA, RNA, proteins, endotoxins, undesirable 

plasmid isoforms, salts and process contaminants are removed. All this steps are resumed in 

Figure 1. 

On a large scale, it is of paramount importance to develop a set of highly efficient processes, 

since the conventional laboratory pDNA purification procedures, as already described, are quite 

complex to scale up and involve the use of chemicals that are forbidden by regulatory agencies 

[19]. Hereupon, purification processes that use membranes were found as a good solution for 

purify pDNA in larger scale, since they avoid the use of dangerous chemicals [15, 20, 23]. 

Furthermore, MF and UF membranes avoid precipitation solvents and centrifugation steps. 

However, the pDNA purification from RNA by ultrafiltration remains a challenge as recently has 

been published in the literature [15, 23].

1.2 Membrane technology 

Membrane technology is a broad and highly interdisciplinary field, where process engineering, 

material science and chemistry meet to produce membranes that have a wide range of 

applications [24]. Membrane filtration usually operates under mild conditions and does not 

require the addition of chemicals to be performed, thus making it generally well-suitable for 

processing of biotechnology products. Membrane filtration also has lower operation costs than 

alternative processes like chromatography and precipitation [25], and a reduced environmental 

impact. Moreover, they possess characteristics that enable a linear scale-up of the process and 

allow its easy automation. Membrane filtration processes can be also designed for operating in 

continuous mode [26-28]. 

Membrane filtration systems take advantage of their high selectivity and high surface-area-per-

unit-volume [29]. They are suitable for processing biological molecules since they operate at 

relatively low temperatures and pressures and involve no phase changes or chemical additives, 

thereby minimizing the extent of denaturation, deactivation, and/or degradation of biological 

products [29]. Membrane processes usually achieve high efficiency in terms of separation, 

which has a great economic impact [30]. 

 

1.2.1 Membrane classification 

Membrane processes can be sorted by several criteria, distinguishing microfiltration from 

ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and from reverse osmosis. Those criteria are: the characteristics 

of the membrane (pore size), size and charge of the retained particles or molecules, and 

pressure exerted on the membrane [31, 32]. In membrane filtration the driving force for the 

separation is a pressure gradient which is imposed through the semi-permeable membrane. 

Suspended solids or solutes are retained in the so-called retentate, while water and non-

retained solutes pass through the membrane in the permeate [31, 32]. 

Microfiltration (MF) membranes have the largest pores (0.1 µm to 10 µm) and the highest 

hydraulic permeability. These values corresponds to the typical size of suspended solids, 

colloids and bacteria; however, MF membranes can only be used as a disinfection barrier if 

actions are taken against bacterial regrowth [31-33]. 

Ultrafiltration (UF) membranes have smaller pores (2 to 100 nm) and the hydraulic permeability 

is considerably lower than in MF. A typical application for these membranes is to retain 

dissolved macromolecules like the largest molecules of the natural organic material [31, 32, 

34]. 

Nanofiltration (NF) is a membrane filtration process used most often with low total dissolved 

solids in water such as surface water and fresh groundwater, with the purpose of softening 

(polyvalent cation removal) and removal of infection by product precursors such as natural 

organic matter and synthetic organic matter. In nanofiltration the pore sizes are smaller than 



Chapter I: Introduction 

6 

 

in UF, typically around 1 nm, this makes NF suitable for the removal of relatively small organics, 

i.e. organic micro pollutants and colour from surface water or groundwater and degradation 

products from effluent of biologically treated wastewater. Furthermore, NF membranes can 

also have a surface charge that allows the removal of ions with a size below the pore size of 

the membrane [31, 32, 35]. 

Reverse osmosis (RO) is a water purification technology that also uses homogeneous (i.e., non-

porous) semipermeable membranes. The applied pressure is used to overcome the osmotic 

pressure. Rejection is not just a result of filtering, but solution-diffusion mechanisms will 

determine the permeation of the dissolved species. The low hydraulic permeability of reverse 

osmosis membrane requires high pressures and, consequently, relatively high energy 

consumption. This effect is even more pronounced in the presence of an osmotic pressure due 

to high concentrations of dissolved components that counteract the effect of the exerted 

pressure [31, 32, 36]. 

The characteristics of all these processes and membranes are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 

2 and 3.

1.2.2 Membranes applications 

Membrane technology can be used in a large number of applications such as solid-liquid 

separation, concentration, buffer exchange, purification and sterilization [25, 27, 39]. 

Membrane technology not only has been extensively used for several applications in 

downstream processes, but in upstream processes too, which leads to a demanding role in the 

purification of biotechnology products [19, 29]. Furthermore, membrane processes are also 

used for water purification [27, 37], nucleic acids (pDNA and RNA) recovery and purification 

[15, 20] and gas–liquid contacting and emulsification [24]. In Table 2 are presented some 

commercial available membranes, as well as their composition and applications.

1.2.3 Membrane properties 

A membrane is a semi-permeable barrier that is used to control transport of some kind of 

species. When the transport direction is out of a system it is called separation; when it is into 

the system it is called membrane contacting. The cause of transport through a membrane is a 

difference in chemical potential between both sides. This difference may be due to a gradient 

in temperature, pressure, concentration or electrical potential [24]. The mechanisms for 

transport strongly depend on membrane morphology. Two typical morphologies can be 

distinguished: porous and dense (homogeneous). Dense membranes are permeable for single 

molecules and have two major characteristics: transport by solution-diffusion model and 

intrinsic selectivity. Solution-diffusion transport is the concentration gradient diffusivity, i.e., 

transport occurs only by diffusion, and can explain dialysis, reverse osmosis, gas permeation 

and pervaporation, and it is clearly material dependent. The component that needs to be 

transported must first be dissolved in the membrane. In solution-diffusion model it is assumed 

that the chemical potential of the feed and permeate fluids are in equilibrium with the adjacent 

membrane surfaces such that appropriate expressions for the chemical potential in the fluid 

and membrane phases can be equated at the solution-membrane interface [24, 40]. Intrinsic 

selectivity is the indication of the membrane separation efficiency and in combination with the 

hydraulic permeability it indicates the general performance of the membrane [24]. 

In porous membranes the transport mechanism is completely different. Transport occurs 

through the empty spaces (pores) of the membrane. However, the interaction with the internal 

membrane surface can play a crucial role. In respect to membrane morphology the surface and 

volume porosity, pore size distribution and tortuosity are important parameters for its 

performance. Tortuosity is a factor used to correct the deviation of pore shape from perfect 

cylinders. It is defined by the ratio of the average path length through the pores and the 

membrane thickness. The pore sizes range goes from micrometers to below 1 nm and the 

porosities range goes from more than 80% for micrometer-sized pores to less than 2% for 

nanometer-sized pores. An important property of membranes used in pressure-driven 

techniques is the hydraulic permeability, Lp, which is the ratio of the observed permeate flux 

to the imposed pressure. Both the porosity, the pore size and the membrane tortuosity affect 

the value of the observed Lp. Lp is also dependent on the viscosity of the permeate and therefore 

is temperature dependent. In respect to ultrafiltration membranes, another important property 

is the molecular weight cut-off, which indicates the molecular weight of the macromolecules 

90% retained by the membrane; this gives an approximate indication of the pore size. In respect 

to the retentive properties of membranes it is also important to define the concepts of sieving 

coefficient and rejection. The sieving coefficient of a certain solute or particle relates the 

concentration of component in permeate to that in the feed. The rejection is defined as one 

minus the sieving coefficient [24]. 

Membranes can be operated in two modes (Figure 4): “dead-end” mode and “cross-flow” mode. 

In the dead-end mode a solution contained in a reservoir is transported towards the membrane. 



Chapter I: Introduction 

12 

 

The components rejected by the membrane will accumulate at the membrane surface and 

eventually will diffuse back to the bulk of the solution in the reservoir. On the other hand, in 

cross-flow mode, the feed flows parallel to the membrane surface. In both cases the stream 

that passes through membrane is called “permeate”, while the remainder is defined as 

“retentate”. Therefore, in a cross-flow system the permeate stream flows perpendicular to the 

feed stream but in a dead-end system the permeate flows in the direction of the feed [24].

[29]). 

 

1.2.4 Factors that affect the filtration process 

In the filtration process, there are certain factors that affect the filtration, these factors are, 

mainly membrane selectivity, the flux and the system capacity [27]. 

The selectivity of the membrane is determined by the pore size distribution and the membrane 

surface properties, i.e., highly selective ultrafiltration membranes can be developed using 

electrically charged membranes that have very high retention of macromolecules with the same 

polarity and similarly. By turn, adsorptive membranes can provide highly selective separations 

based on the specific binding of several components on the surface of the membrane [41, 42]. 

The selectivity is directly related to the solute filtering coefficient: 



Chapter I: Introduction 

13 

 

? =
??

??
 

where Cf is permeate solution and CF is the feed solution [27]. 

The flux is evaluated using the actual feedstock of interest, being typically less than the value 

predicted from the clean membrane permeability, due to fouling and concentration 

polarization effects [43]. The pure water flux is related to the membrane hydraulic 

permeability: 

?? =
??
??

 

where Jv is the flux (volumetric flow rate per unit membrane area) and ?P is the transmembrane 

pressure difference [27]. The membrane fouling can arise from adsorption on and within the 

membrane pores and/or from the formation of a deposit on the external surface of the 

membrane (Figure 5). Concentration polarization refers to the accumulation of completely or 

partially retained solutes at the upstream surface of the membrane due to bulk mass transfer 

limitations of the membrane. The dominant effect in protein ultrafiltration is the reduction in 

the effective pressure driving force due to osmotic pressure effects [27]. The extent of the 

concentration polarization can be controlled by adjusting the fluid flow characteristics, 

typically by providing high local shear rates in cross-flow filtration modules or by stirring the 

feed in “dead-end” filtration [44, 45]. 

 

 

Figure 5 Membrane fouling can occur due to adsorption within the membrane pores (a), adsorption on 
the membrane surface (b) or by both of them (c) (adapted from [46]). 

 

The system capacity is defined as the volume of feed that can be processed per unit membrane 

area, before the membrane needs to be regenerated or replaced. For membrane processes

Chapter I: Introduction

operated at a constant transmembrane pressure, the capacity is typically defined as the point 

at which the filtrate flow rate has dropped to less than 10% of its initial value or below a pre-

determined flux that is required for a particular application. For operation at constant filtrate 

flux, the capacity is defined by the maximum pressure drop that can be tolerated by the system, 

and can be limited by the membrane. The adsorptive membrane capacity is defined by the 

appearance of an unacceptable level of a key component in the flow-through stream (referred 

to as breakthrough). Breakthrough is determined by both the equilibrium (static) binding 

properties of the membrane in combination with any mass transfer limitations in the device. 

The capacity of depth filters can be determined by either the breakthrough of a key component 

or by an unacceptable pressure drop [27]. 

 

1.3 Nanofibrous membranes 

Electrospinning is an easy and cheap method of producing nanofibres [21]. The simplicity of 

this procedure and the wide range of applications found in recent years, including tissue 

engineering applications, such as bone repair, wound healing and drug delivery [47-49], sensors 

and biosensors production [50], polymeric conductive membranes1 development [51] and 

filtration2 [52-54]. Such variety of applications leads to an increased interest in developing new 

types of electrospun nanofibre membranes [55]. 

The electrospinning apparatus consists in three basic components (Figure 6): a needle attached 

to a syringe filled with a polymer solution; a grounded collector plate; a high voltage power 

supply, connected between the capillary and the collector; and a syringe pump that is usually 

used to control the feeding rate of the polymer solution. A charged polymer solution flowing 

out of the needle is accelerated towards the grounded collector through the application of a 

strong electrostatic field [55, 56]. This electromagnetic field causes the droplet to emerge from 

the needle to undergo deformation into a conical shape, known as the “Taylor cone” (Figure 7) 

[57]. When a critical value is attained (the repulsive electrostatic force overcomes the surface 

tension) a fine jet of the solution emerges from the “Taylor cone”. The jet undergoes twisting 

instability and a characteristic whipping motion due to the charge-charge repulsion that occurs 

between the excess charges presented in the jet (Figure 6). During this phase, the jet is drawn 

by at least two orders of magnitude, the solvent evaporates and the dry fibres deposit onto the 

collector [56, 58-60]. A polymer melt, instead of a polymer-solvent solution, can also be used 

by a heating system that surrounds the reservoir and maintains the temperature [56, 61].

1.3.1 Parameters that influence the production of nanofibrous 

The fibre structure is affected by different factors such as the density of chain entanglements, 

solution conductivity, solution viscosity, strength of applied field, polymer feed rate, needle 

size and diameter, and the distance between the needle and the collector. Moreover, the 

surrounding conditions such as temperature, humidity and air velocity also affect the 

morphology of the fibres. 

The density of chain entanglements, as shown in Figure 8, is an important parameter since it 

prevents the occurrence of the phenomena known as Rayleigh instability, and is related to the 

solution viscosity (directly controlled by the molecular weight of the polymer and the solution 

concentration). The chain entanglements prevent the jet to break up and, therefore, the 



Chapter I: Introduction 

16 

 

Rayleigh instability3 [62] does not occur, which result into a continuous fibre formation. If the 

density of chain entanglements in a given solution is less than a critical value, the jet breaks 

up due to insufficient resistance to the electrostatic field [63-65]. If the entanglements in the 

chains are present but the amount of the chain superposition is below the critical value, then 

Rayleigh instability is not completely eliminated, leading to the formation of fibres with beaded 

morphologies [64, 65]. 

 

 

Figure 8 Illustration of polymer chain entanglement: (a) isolated polymer chains, (b) entangled polymer 
chains (adapted from [56]). 

 

An increase in the solution viscosity, beyond necessary minimum, increases the visco-elastic 

force which opposes coulombic force and therefore leads to an increase in fibre size. An 

increase in the strength of the field and/or conductivity of the polymer solution could be 

expected to lead to a decrease in fibre size [55, 56]. 

Other parameter that affects electrospinning process and fibre morphology is the solution 

conductivity. Fluids with high conductivity have high surface charge density, and under the 

influence of an electric field, suffer an elongation force on the jet, which is caused by the self-

repulsion of the excess charges at their surface. This inhibits the Rayleigh instability, enhances 

whipping, and leads to the formation of thin fibres [63, 66, 67]. 

A higher feeding rate of the polymer solution and/or larger size of the needle diameter 

increases the fibre size, and a larger distance between needle tip and collector plate decreases 

fibre size. These effects are not linear and do not necessarily mean that the quality of the 

product is maintained but they give a general idea about the trends [55]. For each polymer 

type and solvent system, there is usually a relatively narrow set of manufacturing conditions 

that provide optimal results [55, 56]. 

At last another parameter affecting the fibre morphology is the interactions between the 

polymer and the solvent, where the molecular weight of the polymer does affect the process. 

If certain physical properties are required for the polymer solution, it is very important to select

the right solvent or combination of the appropriate solvents, since the first and key step in the 

electrospinning process is the polymer dissolution in a suitable solvent [55]. The dielectric 

constant (table 3) and the boiling temperature of the solvent are absolutely decisive when 

selecting the correct one to produce nanofibrous. Solvents with a low dielectric constant will 

improve the dissolution of the polymer charged chains by dispersing the ion pairs, enhancing 

the conductivity and, therefore, reducing the need of applying extreme voltages [56]. 

Furthermore, solvents with low boiling point will evaporate faster from the polymer surface, 

upon fibre formation [55, 56].

1.3.2 Polymeric Nanofibrous 

The ability of reducing the diameter of polymeric fibre materials from micrometers to 

nanometers enables several remarkable features, such as very large surface area to volume 

ratio, versatility of the nanofibrous surface functionalization and superior mechanical 

performance (e.g. stiffness and tensile strength) that allow the production of fibres with a wide 

variety of sizes and shapes [68]. 

The morphological, chemical and mechanical characterization of the nanofibrous is usually 

performed. The fibre diameter, distribution, orientation and morphology (i.e. cross-section 

shape and surface roughness) are usually characterized by scanning electron microscopy, field 

emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and atomic force 

microscopy [55, 69-74]. The characterization of the molecular structure (chemical 

characterization) of a nanofibre can be performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 

and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. If two polymers are blended together for the 

fabrication of nanofibrous, not only the structure of the two materials can be detected but the 

intermolecular interaction can be determined by the use of these methods; the characteristic 

peaks from each component of the membrane must be found in the spectra of the final product 

[55, 75]. The mechanical characterization, which consists in the precise measurement of 

mechanical properties of the nanofibrous matrix, is crucial especially for biomedical 

applications. For example, for nanofibrous acting as scaffolds, they must be able to withstand 

the forces exerted by the growing tissue or during physiological activities and related 

biomechanics and therefore, their mechanical characterization should be performed. The 

mechanical characterization is achieved by applying tensile test loads to specimens prepared 

from the electrospun ultrafine non-woven fibre mats. The tensile tests consist in stretching the 

membrane to the point of rupture and analyse its resistance. During the mechanical 

characterization of single nanofibrous, sufficient care must be taken in sample mounting in 

order to avoid severe damage or sample manipulation [55, 76, 77]. 

Electrospun fibres can be applied in different areas, such as filtration, wound healing, affinity 

membrane, protective clothing, energy generation, enzyme immobilization, drug delivery, 

tissue engineering and biosensors (Figure 9) [78, 79]. For filtration, the channels and structural 

elements of a filter must be matched to the scale of the particles or droplets that will be 

captured in the filter. Thus, we can take advantage of the unique properties of electrospun 

membranes consisting of very-small-diameter fibres [55]. 

In wound healing, an ideal dressing should have certain characteristics such as haemostatic 

ability, efficiency as bacterial barrier, absorption aptitude of excess exudates (wound 

fluid/pus), appropriate water vapour transmission rate, adequate gaseous exchange capability, 

capacity to conform to the contour of the wound area, functional adhesion (i.e., adherent to 

healthy tissue but non-adherent to wound tissue) painless to patient and ease of removal, and 

finally have a low cost [55, 80]. 



Chapter I: Introduction 

19 

 

Affinity membranes are a broad class of membranes that selectively capture specific target 

molecules (or ligands) by immobilizing a specific ligand onto the membrane surface. They 

reflect technological advances in both fixed-bed liquid chromatography and membrane 

filtration, and combine both the outstanding selectivity of the chromatography resins and the 

reduced pressure associated to filtration membranes [55, 81, 82]. 

Electrospun nanofibre membranes have been recognized as potential candidates for protective 

clothing applications, because of their low weight, large surface area, high porosity (breathable 

nature), great filtration efficiency, resistance to penetration of harmful chemical agents in 

aerosol form and their ability to neutralize the chemical agents without impedance of the air 

and water vapour permeability to the clothing. Protective clothing should have some essential 

properties, ensured by the nanofibrous, such as low weight, breathable fabric, air and water 

vapour permeability, insolubility in all solvents and enhanced toxic chemical resistance [55, 

83, 84]. 

Polymeric conductive membranes also have the potential to be applied for electrostatic 

dissipation, corrosion protection, electromagnetic interference shielding, photovoltaic devices 

and fabrication of tiny electronic devices or machines such as Schottky junctions, sensors and 

actuators etc., as the rate of electrochemical reactions is proportional to the surface area of 

the electrode [55, 85, 86]. 

Immobilization of enzymes on inert insoluble materials is an active area of research for 

improving the functionality and performance of enzymes for bioprocessing applications since 

the immobilized enzymes offer several advantages such as reusability, better control reaction 

and are more stable than soluble ones. The performance of immobilized enzymes depends 

greatly on the characteristics and structure of the carrier materials and the modification of the 

carriers, such as rendering biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, etc. [87]. The fine porous structure 

of electrospun fibres membranes can effectively relieve the diffusion resistance of the 

substrates/products and can greatly increase the catalysing ability of the immobilized enzymes 

due to the large specific surface area [55, 88, 89]. 

Controlled drug release at a defined rate over a definite period of time is possible with 

biocompatible delivery matrices of polymers, biodegradable polymers are therefore mostly 

used as drug delivery systems to deliver therapeutic agents because they can be easily designed 

for programmed dissemination in a controlled fashion [55, 90]. Nanofibre mats have been 

applied as drug carriers in drug delivery systems because of their high functional characteristics 

and because drug delivery system that rely on the principle that the dissolution rate of a 

particulate drug increases with the increase of the surface of the drug. Also, the large surface 

area associated with nanospun fabrics allows fast and efficient solvent evaporation, that 

provides the incorporated drug limited time to recrystallize which favours the formation of 

amorphous dispersions or solid solutions [55, 91]. 



Chapter I: Introduction

For engineered living tissues, a biodegradable scaffold is generally considered as an 

indispensable element. Nanofibres are used as temporary templates for cell adhesion, 

proliferation and differentiation in order to repair and restore the damaged tissue, i.e., to 

reproduce the native extracellular matrix (ECM) environment. There has been an increased rush 

in the use of electrospinning techniques to create nanofibrous scaffolds for tissue engineering 

due to the reports that indicate that these scaffolds positively promote cell–matrix and cell–

cell interactions with the cells having a normal phenotypic shape and gene expression [55, 92]. 

Finally, biosensors, which typically consist of a bio-functional membrane and a transducer, have 

been widely used for environmental, food, and clinical purposes. There are many parameters 

that affect the performance of a sensor which includes sensitivity, selectivity, response time, 

reproducibility and aging, all of which are dependent directly on the property of the sensing 

membrane used. Since there is a strong need for detection of gases and biological substances 

when they are present in low concentrations, sensitivity plays a very critical role. Modern 

biomedical sensors with advanced micro fabrication and signal-processing techniques are 

becoming more and more accurate and inexpensive nowadays [55, 93]. Electrospun nanofibrous 

membranes have received great attention for applications as sensors because of their unique 

large surface area which is the most desirable property for improving the sensitivity of 

conductimetric sensors, a larger surface area will absorb more gas analyte and change the 

sensor's conductivity more significantly. Silk fibroin membranes-based biosensors have been 

extensively used for analysing various substances such as glucose, hydrogen peroxide and uric 

acid [55, 94, 95]. 

In this work, a poly ?-caprolactone support was prepared by a conventional electrospinning 

process. This polymer was selected based on the good mechanical properties that PCL meshes 

present [21, 96] and also for being environmentally friendly [21, 97]. A coating based on an 

electrospun mixture of two polymers, k-carrageenan and polyethylene oxide (PEO), was 

deposited on the PCL support. k-carrageenan was selected for Electrospun Nanofibre 

Membranes (ENMs) coating due to its high hydrophilicity, relatively low cost, the ability of 

producing small diameter fibres by electrospinning, when mixed with PEO, and due to their 

sulphate groups [21, 98, 99]. This asymmetric arrangement of two different layers provides the 

membrane with suitable mechanical robustness whereas separation selectiveness is regulated 

predominantly by the ultrathin layer of nanofibres [21].

1.3.3 Application of nanofibrous membranes on separation processes 

Electrospun nanofibrous membrane have successfully been developed and used for the 

production of high-performance air filters. The filtration efficiency, which is closely associated 

with fibre thickness, is one of the most important concerns for filter performance. Generally, 

when filter efficiency increases linearly with the decrease of the thickness of the membrane 

filter and the applied pressure increases. The enhanced filtration efficiency at the same 

pressure drop is possible with fibres having diameters less than 0.5 µm [55, 100]. Electrospun 

membranes offer a wide set of advantages for filtration applications, such as higher porosity 

(typically around 80%), higher surface area to volume ratio and high surface cohesion (which 

facilitates particle entrapment and, therefore, improves the filtration efficiency), lower base 

weight, and continuously interconnected pores, when compared to conventional polymer and 

ceramic membranes. These attributes can directly improve the flux performance without 

sacrificing the contaminant rejection ratio [101, 102]. The consistent production of very small 

diameter fibres enables the removal of unwanted particles at the submicron scale, which is 

clearly an advantage of the electrospinning membranes [55]. 

Electrospinning membranes have been reported for application in separation processes, 

especially in pressure-driven separations, such as microfiltration, ultrafiltration or 

nanofiltration [103-105], but for this type of application it is required a support that provides 

mechanical strength, unlike conventional cast membranes. Consequently, nowadays, 

electrospinning membranes used in filtration technology are based in hybrid systems, i.e., 

electrospun nanofibres are placed over a support and combined in various layers or blended 

together with micron scale fibres [106]. 

 

1.4 Hydrogel membranes 

Currently, there are several UF membranes commercially available that can be used for pDNA 

purification [20, 23]. Considering the size of pDNA molecules, surface modification of 

microfiltration membranes also arises as a possible choice, offering the possibility of adjusting 

the desired selectivity in each particular case. Several studies have shown the enhancement of 

membrane properties such as resistance to fouling by proteins, biocompatibility, introduction 

of electric charge and improved hydrophobicity through surface modification methods [107-

109]. In this work, a hydrogel coating (agarose) was impregnated to a commercial MF membrane 

with 0.22 µm of nominal pore diameter (membrane selected based on its cost-effective value, 

mechanical strength and heat resistance which facilitates the impregnation of a hot solution 

[110]) by an adaptation of a method described in literature [111]. The deposition of the agarose 

layer and its impregnation through the porous structure of the MF membrane was expected to 

provide a substantial increase of pDNA rejection comparing to the non-modified membrane. 

From the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that a modified MF membrane is evaluated 

for its possible application in a pDNA purification process.

1.4.1 Hydrogel characteristics 

The widespread use of hydrogels in areas such as liquid chromatography, drug delivery, and 

therapeutic implants, and the existence of various body tissues with gel-like characteristics 

(i.e. connective tissue and basement membranes) make it important to understand the rates 

of plasmids transmissions and other macromolecules through these materials [111]. In 

separation and purification of biological macromolecules, it is important to study the gel 

filtration medium. The gels based on cross-linked polysaccharides have been regarded as close 

to ideal and most media on the market today are based on these materials. However, even if 

hydrophilicity and inertness are necessary properties of a functional gel filtration medium, 

there are a number of other requirements, such as adequate pore size distribution, rigidity, 

physical and chemical stability, which also have to be fulfilled. Media-based on cross-linked 

agarose share most of these properties [112]. 

In the present work, agarose was chosen also for its hydrophilic and thermo-responsive 

character; this linear polysaccharide extracted from marine algae, consisting of 1,4-linked 3,6-

anhydro-?-l-galactose and 1,3-linked ?-d-galactose derivatives forms a thermo-reversible gels, 

when a homogeneous solution is cooled from 90 ºC to a temperature below the ordering 

temperature, which is around 35 ºC. This phenomenon is based on the physical cross-linking of 

the helical structure formed by the agarose polymer. The physical cross-linking gives rise to a 

three dimensional network of aggregated polymer molecules; its pore-size distribution only 

depends on the agarose concentration of the starting solution. By covalent cross-linking the 

aggregated polymers in an aqueous environment, the chemical and physical stability of agarose 

gels can be considerably improved [112]. Agarose gels have been investigated in several 

applications due to their suitable properties for membrane modification and impregnation, and 

the mechanical properties presented can be easily tailored by varying the polymer 

concentration [113, 114]. Due to its physical properties, when agarose is solubilized in water, 

it forms a gel with a rigid network, resulting on a three-dimensional porous structure providing 

a rigid assembly when lies at room temperature (RT) [114]. Agarose gel appears as an 

apyrogenic, colourless and transparent gel, which is viscous-elastic at temperatures above 45 

ºC [115].

2. Materials and methods 

 

2.1 Materials 

Acetone (MW = 58.08 g/mol) was purchased from Labsolve (Porto Salvo, Portugal) and agarose 

(MW = 120 kDa) was from Grisp (Porto, Portugal). Calcium chloride (MW = 110.99 g/mol), 

kanamycin sulphate, PEO (MW=300,000 g/mol), PCL (MW=80,000 g/mol) and Terrific Broth 

medium for bacterial culture were bought from Sigma-Aldrich (Sintra, Portugal). k-carrageenan 

(MW = 401.3193 g/mol) was obtained for FMC BioPolymer (Philadelphia, PA, United States). 

NZYMaxiprep kit for bacterial cell lyses and pDNA purification was acquired from NZYTech 

(Lisboa, Portugal) and Tris-HCl 10 mM was from IZASA (Lisboa, Portugal). A microfiltration 

Nylaflo membrane (pore diameter of 0.22 ?m) was purchased from Pall Corporation. 

 

2.2 Methods 

 

2.2.1 Bacterial growth, cell lysis and pDNA purification 

The plasmid production procedure was adapted from the literature [20, 21, 116]. The 6050 bp 

plasmid pVAX1-LacZ was amplified in a cell culture of E. coli DH5?. The fermentation was 

carried out at 37 ºC in 250 mL of Terrific Broth medium, supplemented with 50 µg/mL of 

kanamycin. Growth was suspended at the late log phase (OD600nm ? 10-11) and the cells were 

harvested by centrifugation. Afterwards, pDNA extraction was performed using an NZYMaxiprep 

kit. That kit contains three buffers to perform the alkaline lysis, respectively: 

? Resuspension buffer (P1): solution of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 8.00 and 10 mM EDTA; 

? Lysis buffer (P2): solution of 200 mM NaOH and 1% SDS (w/v); 

? Neutralization buffer (P3): Solution of 3 M of potassium acetate at pH = 5.00. 

Besides the buffers, the kit also contains purification columns to obtain a pDNA free of 

contaminants. After the extraction and purification, pDNA was stored at 4 ºC before filtration 

assays. 

 

2.2.2 Electrospinning setup 

A conventional electrospinning system was used to produce the membranes. The apparatus was 

composed by a high power voltage supply (Spellman CZE1000R, 0-30 kV), a syringe pump (KDS-

100), a plastic syringe with a stainless steel needle and an aluminium disk (radius 2.4 cm) 

connected to a copper collector. To produce fibres there must be a driving force generated by 



Chapter II: Materials and methods 

27 

 

the electromagnetic field created between the needle, which is positively charged by high 

voltage source, and the metal collector, which is grounded [21, 55]. 

 

2.2.3 Preparation of the polymer solutions 

The PCL polymer solution (10% w/v) was prepared by dissolving the polymer in acetone, at 50 

ºC, under constant stirring [117]. Meanwhile, a PEO/k-carrageenan solution was prepared by 

mixing and dissolving 6.75% (w/v) of PEO and 0.5% (w/v) of k-carrageenan in MiliQ water, under 

constant stirring too [118]. 

The solution of agarose (2% w/v) was prepared by dissolving the polymer in MiliQ water under 

constant stirring, at 90 ºC [119]. 

 

2.2.4 Electrospun nanofibre membranes production 

To produce the support ENM, a PCL polymer solution (Figure 10a) was injected at a constant 

flow rate of 3 mL/h and subjected to an applied voltage of 15 kV and with the collector placed 

at 10 cm from the needle [117]. After the production of the support, the PEO/k-carrageenan 

polymer solution (Figure 10b and c, respectively) was deposited over the PCL ENM by 

electrospinning, in the same equipment, at a constant flow rate of 0.6 mL/h and an applied 

voltage of 18 kV, thereby obtaining a bi-layer membrane. At least, the Coated Electrospun 

Nanofibre Membrane (ENMC) was crosslinked in a calcium chloride solution for 24 h [21, 118]. 

From the obtained films, membrane disks were cut with suitable size to be used in the filtration 

cell, using a circular blade [21].

2.2.5 Modification of a commercial microfiltration membrane 

A nylon 6,6 (Figure 11b) hydrophilic membrane, Nylaflo from Millipore was modified by agarose 

(Figure 11a) impregnation. The modification method was adapted from the literature [111] 

through the deposition of agarose to improve pDNA rejection (Figure 11a). An agarose solution 

(prepared by the method mentioned in section 2.2.3) was cooled down to a temperature of 70 

°C and deposited over the MF membrane. To avoid air bubbles during the process, two glass 

plates were used and clamped. After 30 min., the membrane was cooled until reach the room 

temperature (RT) [119].

2.2.6 Scanning electron microscopy 

The morphology of all the membranes was analysed by SEM. Samples of ENMs were air-dried 

overnight and samples of modified-Nylaflo membrane were frozen using liquid nitrogen and 

freeze-dried overnight. Then, all the samples were mounted onto aluminium stubs with double 

adhesive tape and sputter-coated with gold using a Quorum Q150R ES sputter coater. The 

samples were analysed using a Hitachi S-3400N scanning electron microscope operated at an 

accelerating voltage of 20 kV and at different amplifications [21, 116]. 

The diameter distribution of the nanofibres in the ENMs was determined from 50 measurements, 

at least, using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda (MD), United States of America). 

 

2.2.7 Attenuated total reflectance-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 

In infrared spectroscopy the radiation crosses the sample, being partially absorbed and partially 

transmitted. The resulting spectra represent the frequency of vibration between the atoms 

linkage from the sample, creating therefore, a specific spectra for those interactions [120]. 

PCL, k-carrageenan, PEO, polymer coated ENMs, agarose, Nylaflo and modified-Nylaflo spectra 

were acquired in the range of 4000 – 525 cm-1, using a JASCO 4200 FTIR spectrophotometer, 

operating in ATR mode (MKII GoldenGateTM Single Reflexion ATR System). Data collection was 

performed with a 4 cm-1 spectral resolution and after 128 scans [21, 116].

2.2.8 Energy dispersive spectroscopy 

In order to determine the percentage of the characteristic elements of the Nylaflo and 

modified-Nylaflo membranes, EDS (Bruker XFlash Detector 5010) analysis was carried out. For 

that, samples were placed on aluminium stub supports and air-dried at room temperature [121]. 

 

2.2.9 Contact angle determination 

Contact angles of the membranes were determined using a Data Physics Contact Angle System 

OCAH 200 apparatus, operating in static mode. For each sample, solvent drops were placed at 

various locations of the analysed surface, at room temperature. The reported contact angles 

are the average of, at least, three measurements [21]. 

 

2.2.10 Membrane porosity determination 

The membrane porosity method was previously described [21]. Briefly, the total porosity of the 

membranes was measured through the determination of the amount of ethanol absorbed by the 

membranes using the following equation [122]: 

 

P(%) =
?2 ? ?1

?????????????????
× 100 

 

where W1 and W2 are the weight of the dry membrane and the weight of the wet membrane, 

respectively, dethanol is the density of the ethanol at room temperature, and Vmembrane is the 

volume of the membrane. The latter was determined from the membrane area and by 

measuring the membrane thickness with a micrometer Adamel Lhomargy M120 acquired from 

Testing Machines Inc., USA. 

 

2.2.11 Plasmid DNA experiments 

All the membrane filtration experiments were performed in a 10 mL stirred cell from 

Amicon/Millipore (Figure 12), model 8010, according to a procedure previously described in the 

literature [20, 123]. The filtration cell has a "dead-end" geometry. The membrane was 

positioned on a horizontal support which enables the permeate to be collected through a 

circular array of channels. Mass transfer of the retained compounds by the membrane, from 

the membrane surface back to the bulk of the solution, can be controlled by mechanical stirring 

of the solution. The filtration cell can be operated in two different ways: at constant pressure 

or constant flux (Figure 13). 

(3) 



Chapter II: Materials and methods 

31 

 

At a constant pressure the liquid is forced to permeate through the membrane, but the flux is 

not easily controlled, only the transmembrane pressure. This method was used to wash the 

membrane, to determine hydraulic permeabilities of the membranes produced and to perform 

pDNA filtration tests with membranes with reduced hydraulic permeability. 

When the constant flux method is used, a peristaltic pump is placed downstream of the 

membrane. With this method the flux can be directly controlled; this method is the ideal to be 

used for membrane characterization with reference solutes since solute rejections can be 

theoretically related with the permeate flux, the average pore size and the solute molecular 

size. However, this method can only be used when low transmembrane pressure gradients are 

generated.

In each test, a new membrane disc was placed in the bottom of the filtration cell, being initially 

flushed with MiliQ water. Then, water was removed and 10 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl 0.15 M NaCl 

(pH = 8.00) buffer were introduced in the filtration cell to determine the hydraulic 

permeability. This was obtained at different pressures with compressed nitrogen (ranging 0.025 

bar to 0.1 bar) by measuring the flux over a period of time. Six permeability measurements 

were performed with each membrane, and the average value was considered as the hydraulic 

permeability of each membrane, Lp. To perform the filtration of pDNA solutions, the remaining 

buffer in the filtration cell was carefully removed and immediately after that, 5 mL of 10 mM 

Tris-HCl 0.15 M NaCl (pH = 8.00) buffer were placed in the cell with 100 µL of an aliquot of 

pDNA (recovered by the method mentioned in section 2.2.1). A continuous filtration of the 

content of the cell was performed by applying a constant pressure and four consecutive samples 

of 0.5 mL of permeate were collected; these four samples correspond to the total permeate 

collected in each run (the experimental setup is shown in Figure 13). The stirring speed was 

kept in all the experiments at 760 min-1 (previous calibration of the stirring system was 

performed). 

 

2.2.12 Determination of Plasmid DNA concentration 

Plasmid concentration was determined by Ultraviolet/Visible Spectroscopy at 260 nm. The 

absorbance of the initial pDNA solution (feed before the filtration assay) and the final 

concentrate (feed after the filtration assay) were determined in each run (as well as the 

absorbance of the four consecutive permeate collected samples previously mentioned). The 10 

mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl (pH = 8.00) buffer was used as the reference solution for measuring 

the absorbance due to pDNA.

3.1 Characterization of the properties of the membranes 

 

3.1.1 Morphological characterization of the produced membranes 

The fibre diameter and fibre average diameter (in case of ENMCs), and the surface appearance 

(in case of Nylaflo and modified-Nylaflo) were analysed through the SEM analysis. 

 

 

Figure 14 SEM images of PCL ENM (a), PCL ENMC (b), Nylaflo (c) and modified-Nylaflo (d). 

 

The ENMs produced (figure 14a and b) present a high density of fibres. The ENMs containing the 

second layer leave even a higher density of nanofibres. The distribution of fibre diameter is 

shown in Figure 15. The PCL support has nanofibres with different diameters (200 nm – 700 nm) 

and this range of fibre diameters is ideal to confer a good mechanical support [124], as 

described by Bosworth et al., PCL meshes presents good mechanical properties [96]. As can be 

seen, the PCL coated with the k-carrageenan presents a higher density of thin fibres (fibres 

with 100 – 200 nm of diameter) than the PCL uncoated, which contributes to a decrease in the 



Chapter III: Results and discussion 

35 

 

dimensions of the interstices. The Nylaflo membrane surface with/without modification were 

also analysed (Figure 14c and d). The results revealed that different surface morphologies were 

obtained after the modification process. As can be observed in Figure 14c the commercial 

membrane surface showed to be porous, with much larger pores than the nominal 0.22 µm are 

observed (nominal value given by the manufacturer), indicating a wide pore size distribution. 

After the modification with agarose the pores could not be observed anymore (Figure 14d).

SEM image of a cross-section of the modified-Nylaflo membrane was also acquired and shows 

the agarose layer over the surface of the Nylaflo membrane (Figure 16). This layer will reduce 

the porosity and the hydraulic permeability of the Nylaflo membrane, conferring characteristics 

of a UF membrane.

The porosity of the membranes, determined gravimetrically, was analysed and the results are 

presented in Figure 17. As can be seen, the porosity of the ENMCs membranes was similar to 

the porosity of Nylaflo membranes which have been found to be not suitable for the purification 

of pVAX1-LacZ. Nevertheless, the porosity of the modified-Nylaflo membrane decreased to a 

much lower value, around 40%, than the original Nylaflo, about 80%.

3.1.2 Attenuated total reflectance-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 

analysis 

An ATR-FTIR (Attenuated total reflectance-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) analysis of 

the membranes was also carried out to check for the presence of the coating layer on both 

membranes. Figure 18 shows the ATR-FTIR spectra of PCL, PEO, k-carrageenan and PCL/PEO+k-

carrageenan (polymer coated ENM) and Figure 19 shows the ATR-FTIR spectra of agarose, 

Nylaflo membrane and modified-Nylaflo. The spectrum of k-carrageenan shows its 

characteristics absorption bands at 3388 cm-1 (-OH stretching) and at 1250 cm-1 that belongs to 

the stretch of S=O group of sulphate group from the anionic polymer [98] (Figure 18a). The 

spectrum of PEO shows the characteristic bands of –CH2 groups in the region between 2990 cm
-

1 and 2850 cm-1 [125] (Figure 18b). In Figure 18c it is presented the spectrum of PCL, which 



Chapter III: Results and discussion 

37 

 

shows an absorption band between 1750 cm-1 and 1740 cm-1 due to C=O groups [126]. The 

spectrum of ENMC (Figure 18d) shows the characteristic peaks of the functional groups of the 

polymers (PCL, PEO and k-carrageenan) used in membrane production, therefore indicating 

that a thin layer of PEO/k-carrageenan was deposited on the PCL support as suggested by the  

SEM images in section 3.1.1 (Figure 14). Furthermore, an intense peak around 3300 cm-1 was 

observed, due to the over-abundance of OH groups in the coating layer, as previously described 

in the literature [127, 128]. 

Figure 19a shows the characteristics peaks of agarose at 3359 cm-1 (-OH stretching), 1042 cm-1 

C-O stretch of sugar molecules, 1636 cm-1 (N-H) and 929 cm-1 (vibration of C-O-C bridge of 3,6-

anydro-L-galactopyranose), in accordance with other reports [129, 130]. The ATR-FTIR 

spectrum of the Nylaflo membrane (Figure 19b) shows the characteristic bands at 3300 cm-1, 

2920 cm-1, 2860 cm-1 and 1640 cm-1 corresponding N-H stretch, CH2 asymmetric stretch, CH2 

symmetric stretch and amide C=O stretch, respectively [110]. Figure 19c shows that the 

hydroxyl group peak of agarose at 3359 cm-1 is presented in the modified-Nylaflo, unlike to that 

observed in the spectrum of the Nylaflo membrane (Figure 19b). 

To further verify if the coating is present on the surface of the PCL ENM and the agarose 

impregnation has occurred, an EDS analysis was also performed.

The amount of chemical elements at the surface of the PCL ENM and PCL ENM coated 

membranes (Figure 20) shows that the surface coating of the PCL ENM was achieved due to the 

increase of the amount of oxygen atoms (characteristic of polyethylene oxid), and the 

appearance of the sulphur peak (belonging to the negative group of sulphate present in the 

molecule of k-carrageenan) (Table 4)

3.1.3 Surface properties characterization 

 

Contact angles were determined to evaluate the hydrophobic character of each membrane. 

This is an important property when considering the filtration of solutions with biomolecules, in 

fact, it is well-known that hydrophilic membranes generally perform better than hydrophobic, 

due to the adsorption phenomena of the biomolecules in to the surface of the membrane [131]. 

As can be seen in Table 6 the uncoated PCL membrane presented a higher contact angle 

(118.72º), which is indicative of a hydrophobic character. After applying the coat (PEO+k-

carrageenan) the contact angle decreased to 99.43º, indicating that the membrane became 

more hydrophilic. The Nylaflo membrane showed to be the most hydrophilic, presenting a 

contact angle of 28.03º for the modified-Nylaflo an increase on the contact angle was observed, 

however the hydrophilic character of the membrane was essentially kept, which is important 

to prevent the occurrence of fouling phenomena during the purification process, namely due 

to protein adsorption.

3.2 Membrane filtration studies 

 

3.2.1 Hydraulic permeability 

The results obtained in the permeability tests are summarized in figure 22. As can be seen, the 

coated PCL ENMC and the Nylaflo membrane have, approximately, the same Lp values. The 

modified-Nylaflo membrane shows lower Lp values when compared to the original Nylaflo. It is 

worth to note that the Lp values of the modified-Nylaflo were the typical of an UF membrane. 

 

 

Figure 22 Hydraulic permeability of the different membranes tested, T = 25 ºC. 

 

3.2.2 Estimation of the pore size of the modified-Nylaflo 

Taking into account the values of hydraulic permeability and the results obtained in the 

filtration tests (discussed in the section 3.2.3), it was decided to determine only the pore size 

in the modified-Nylaflo membranes. 

The pore radius of the modified membranes was estimated from the rejections of reference 

proteins using the theory of hindered transport of spherical solutes in liquid-filled pores [132], 

more specifically using the method described as the symmetric pore model, SPM, in [133]. The 

SPM enables the immediate determination of the membrane pore radius from the intrinsic 

rejections of a reference solute with a known hydrodynamic radius, rs, and the Lp of the 



Chapter III: Results and discussion 

42 

 

membrane [133]. Intrinsic rejections were calculated from the observed rejections, by 

estimating the mass transfer coefficient of the proteins in the concentration polarization layer, 

using the correlation proposed by Opong &amp;amp; Zydney [134]. The proteins used in this work and 

their relevant properties are summarized in Table 7. The observed rejections and the 

corresponding estimate values of pore radius are indicated in Table 8. The hydraulic 

permeability of the membranes was measured before and after filtration to confirm the 

absence of fouling in these tests. The average pore radius obtained was 33 nm, which is 

substantially lower than the nominal value of the pore radius of the Nylaflo commercial 

membrane, which is 100 nm.

3.2.3 Plasmid DNA experiments 

Biomolecules separation is important in biology, medicine and chemistry [39, 137]. Herein, 

pDNA a flexible biomolecule was used in this study. After membrane characterization, the 

quantification of pDNA rejection was carried out (figure 23 and 24). 

As can be seen in Figure 23, when the electrospun membrane (filtration with constant flux) was 

used, the rejection4 (Robs) has a tendency to decrease with the increase of the flux (Jv), which 

is indicative of the occurrence of significant concentration polarization. However, the most 

                                                 
4 The rejection (Robs) is defined as 1-Cp/Cb, where Cp is the concentration of the solute (pDNA in this case) 
in the permeate and Cb is the concentration in the bulk of the feeding solution. 



Chapter III: Results and discussion 

43 

 

important fact to highlight about these results was the occurrence of pDNA rejection itself, 

taking into account the very open structure of the produced membranes. 

For the modified-Nylaflo membrane (filtration with constant pressure), at low fluxes of 

permeate the membrane presented near 100% of pDNA rejection, which makes it adequated 

for application in pDNA purification (one cannot say the same about the PCL ENMC membrane). 

Also, it was again observed that when the flux was increased, the rejection was decreased. 

Knowing the rp value of the modified-Nylaflo and the radius of gyration, rg, of the pDNA 

molecule, Morão et al. [138] had recently shown that one can be accurately estimate through 

the observed rejections of this type of flexible biomolecules, in the case of several conventional 

(asymmetric polymeric) ultrafiltration membranes [20, 23, 138]. The model used for the 

calculations assumes the occurrence of flow induced molecular deformation of the molecular 

structure of the macromolecules, which leads to their permeation through narrow pores, as a 

consequence of the permeation flux. The probability of permeation, thus the intrinsic filtering 

coefficient, can be estimated from the ratio rg/rp. In order to estimate observed sieving 

coefficients it was necessary, also, to estimate the concentration polarization of the 

macromolecule and for this purpose could be used the correlation obtained by Opong &amp;amp; Zydney 

[134] as described by Morão et al. [138]. Using this model, the theoretical curve (shown in 

Figure 24) was calculated using rg = 90 nm; the rg value depends on the ionic strength of the 

solution and it was estimated following the method proposed by Morão et al. [138]. The 

observed rejections appeared to be significantly higher than what was predicted, strongly 

suggesting that the structure of the hydrogel layer (agarose) affected the retention of pDNA 

molecules, by significantly increasing it. A possible explanation for this phenomena may be 

that, although the porosity of the modified-Nylaflo membranes decreased in respect to the 

non-modified membrane. The experimental values obtained were still very high, in fact, near 

30% of porosity is a very high value for the membrane porosity of an ultrafiltration membrane, 

considering that conventional ultrafiltration membranes have typical porosities in the range of 

2-7% [135, 139]. The effect of the porosity at the membrane surface, which can be identified 

with the ratio of the pore area to the membrane area, on the rejection of a large flexible 

molecule like pDNA can be significant, considering that flow-induced deformation is expected 

to decrease as the porosity increases, due to less suction effects. A similar effect may also 

explain the unexpectedly high pDNA rejections observed for the PCL ENMS membranes, taking 

into account the high porosity of these membranes.

4. Conclusion and future perspectives 

 

In this work two different membranes were produced, an electrospun nanofibre membrane and 

a modified nylon. The electrospun membrane was produced, by the deposition of a PEO/k-

carrageenan layer on a PCL support. Both layers (PEO/k-carrageenan and PCL) were produced 

by electrospinning. Electrospun nanofibres that have been previously used in a practical and 

cost-effective way for the production of polymer scaffolds and also for microfiltration 

applications were found to be not suitable, however, for pDNA purification since the obtained 

rejections are not high enough. 

The modified-Nylaflo membrane presented characteristics of an ultrafiltration membrane, 

namely in terms of hydraulic permeability and pore size, however with a very high porosity 

when compared to conventional asymmetric polymeric ultrafiltration membranes. The modified 

membrane presented 100% of pDNA rejection at low values of flux. Accordingly, these 

membranes can be used to purify pDNA. This fact and also the simplicity of the modification 

procedure makes this type of modified membranes potential candidates for being used in 

practical applications for in pDNA purification.  

In future, through the optimization of the electrospinning process of k-carrageenan or using 

other negatively charged polymers, it is possible that UF membranes can be also produced 

taking into account the importance of the electrical charge of the membrane for pDNA 

rejection. 

Despite the potential shown by modified-Nylaflo membranes there were some issues that need 

to be addressed before considering this work for industrial purposes. The most relevant one is 

the production process feasibility in large scale which needs to be investigated. Furthermore, 

pDNA recovery with simultaneous removal of the different contaminants (presented in the 

process stream before UF) namely RNA removal, needs to be investigated by testing membranes 

prepared with different agarose concentrations and possibly other hydrogels.

The demanding ever-increasing quantities of highly purified biomolecules by bio-industries, has
triggered the development of new, more efficient, purification techniques. The application of mem-
brane-based technologies has become very attractive in this field, for their high throughput capability,
simplicity of operation and scale-up.

Herein we report the production of a bi-layer membrane by electrospinning (ES), in which a support of
poly e-caprolactone nanofibers was coated with a polyethylene oxide/sodium alginate layer, and subse-
quently cross-linked with calcium chloride. The membranes were characterized by SEM, ATR-FTIR,
contact angle measurements, and were applied in the recovery process of a plasmid. The results show
that membranes retained the suspended solids while allowing the permeation of plasmid DNA, with high
recovery yields and improved RNA retention. Moreover, they also showed a very low fouling tendency. To
the best of our knowledge it is the first time that ES membranes are applied in this type of bioprocess.

1. Introduction

The development of new separation technologies suitable for
the large-scale production of highly purified plasmid DNA (pDNA)
for gene therapy applications and the production of DNA vaccines
has found increasing interest in the recent years [1–4]. The use of
microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes for pDNA recovery
and purification from fermentation broths has been demonstrated
as a promising alternative to conventional separation methods,
namely those involving precipitation with solvents and centrifuga-
tion [5].

Electrospinning is an easy and cheap method of producing
nanofibrous materials. These can be obtained from a wide variety
of polymers by controlling the solution properties and the process-
ing conditions [6]. The simplicity of this procedure and the wide
range of applications found in recent years, including tissue
engineering applications, such as bone repair, wound healing and
drug delivery carriers [7–9], in sensors and biosensors [10], in elec-
trodes [11] and that of filtration [12–14] are important factors that
lead to an increasing interest in developing new types of electro-
spun nanofiber membranes (ENMs) [15]. Commonly, nanofibers

are electrospun into a support or produced in layer by layer
arrangements [16,17]. In either case fiber deposition should be al-
ways carried out on a support which provides the required
mechanical strength to the films produced [16].

In the present study, a poly e-caprolactone (PCL) support was
prepared by a conventional electrospinning process. This polymer
was selected based on the good mechanical properties that PCL
meshes present [18] and also for being environmentally friendly
[19]. A coating based on an electrospun mixture of two polymers,
sodium alginate (SA) combined with poly(ethylene) oxide (PEO)
was deposited on the support. SA was selected for ENMs coating
due to its high hydrophilicity, relatively low cost and the ability
of producing small diameter fibers by electrospinning, when mixed
with PEO [20]. This asymmetric arrangement of two different lay-
ers provides the membrane with adequate mechanical robustness
whereas separation selectiveness is regulated predominantly by
the ultrathin layer of nanofibers.

The bi-layer membranes produced were characterized in terms
of their morphology, hydrophilicity and hydraulic permeability
prior to the filtration tests. The performance of the ENMs on
the filtration of cell lysates, obtained immediately after the cell
lysis step, was evaluated and compared with that of commercial
microfiltration membranes. From the best of our knowledge, this
is the first time that ENMs are tested in the recovery process of
biomolecules from fermentation broths.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Materials

PEO (Mw = 300,000 g/mol), SA (Mw = 120000–190,000 g/mol),
PCL (Mw = 80,000 g/mol), calcium chloride (Mw = 110.99 g/mol)
were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (Sin tra, Portugal) as well
as Terrific Broth medium for bacterial culture and kanamycin sul-
fate. P1 buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH = 8.00, 10 mM EDTA and
100 lg/mL of RNase A), P2 buffer (200 mM NaOH and 1% SDS
(w/v)) and P3 buffer (3 M of potassium acetate, pH 5.00) were
from a Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Kit and Tris–HCl 10 mM (IZASA,
Portugal). Microfiltration membranes, Nylaflo (pore diameter of
0.22 lm Pall Corporation and FSM0.45PP from Alfa Laval (pore
diameter of 0.45 lm).

2.2. Methods

2.2.1. Bacterial growth and cell lysis
The plasmid production procedure was adapted from the liter-

ature [5,21]. The 6050 bp plasmid pVAX1-LacZ was amplified in a
cell culture of Escherichia coli DH5a. The fermentation was carried
out at 37 ?C in 250 mL of Terrific Broth medium, supplemented
with 50 lg/mL of kanamycin. Growth was suspended at the late
log phase (OD600_nm ? 10–11) and cells were harvested by centri-
fugation. Afterwards, pDNA extraction was performed by alkaline
lysis using three different buffers (P1, P2 and P3, previously spec-
ified). For this procedure 120 g/L (wet weight) of cells were resus-
pended in 4 mL of P1 buffer. Then, 4 mL of P2 were added to
promote cell lysis for 5 min, at room temperature. Finally, P3 buffer
at 4 ?C was added to neutralize the alkaline solution. A large quan-
tity of suspended solids was obtained upon neutralization and the
suspension was kept on ice for 15 min before membrane filtration.

2.2.2. ENMs production process
A conventional electrospinning apparatus was used for ENMs

production. The system setup consisted in a high voltage source
(Spellman CZE1000R, 0–30 kV), a syringe pump (KDS-100), a plastic
syringe with a stainless steel needle and an aluminum disk con-
nected to a copper collector. PCL was dissolved in acetone
(10% w/v), at 50 ?C, under constant stirring [22]. Meanwhile, a
PEO/SA solution was prepared by mixing 6.75% PEO and 0.5% SA
aqueous solutions [23]. The PCL polymer solution was used to pro-
duce a support ENM, using a constant flow rate of 3 mL/h and an
applied voltage of 15 kV. The distance between needle tip and col-
lector was set at 10 cm [22]. Subsequently, the PEO/SA solution
was deposited over the PCL ENM by electrospinning, in the same
apparatus, at a constant flow rate of 0.6 mL/h and an applied volt-
age of 18 kV, thereby obtaining a bi-layer ENM. Finally, the
Fig. 1. Experimental set-up used for continuous diafiltrations,
membrane was crosslinked in a calcium chloride solution for
24 h [23]. From the obtained films, membranes disks were cut with
suitable size to be used in the filtration cell, using a circular blade.

2.2.3. Membrane filtration tests
These assays were performed in a 10 mL stirred cell (Amicon/

Millipore, model 8010), according to a procedure previously de-
scribed in the literature [19]. The membranes to be tested (Nylaflo,
FSM0.45PP or the ENMs) were initially flushed with 20 mL of
Milli-Q water at a constant pressure of 0.07 bar, to ensure the thor-
ough washing of the membranes. Then, the water permeability
(hydraulic permeability) of each membrane was determined by
measuring the flow rate, at that pressure. Five permeability mea-
surements were performed with each membrane disk and the
average value was considered the initial hydraulic permeability
of each membrane disk, Lp0.

To perform the filtration of the E. coli DH5a lysates the remain-
ing water in the cell was carefully removed and, immediately after
that, 10 mL of lysate were introduced in the filtration cell. A contin-
uous diafiltration of the lysate was performed for 1 h, using a
10 mM Tris–HCl (pH = 8.00) buffer at a constant flow rate of
0.5 mL/min. Two peristaltic pumps were used, one for feeding
the diafiltration buffer and the other to perform the filtration (by
suction). The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. Under these
conditions, one could estimate that, if no pDNA was adsorbed on
the membrane and the membrane rejection was 0, approximately
95% of the pDNA was expected to be recovered in the permeate,
while 5% would remain in the cell. It was decided to not try to re-
cover the remaining pDNA to avoid excessive dilution of the whole
permeate.

2.2.4. Turbidity measurements
The filtrate was analyzed by UV/Visible Spectroscopy at a wave-

length of 600 nm, to determine the amount of suspended solids. A
fraction of the alkaline lysate, containing the suspended solids, was
transferred to an eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 18,000g during
30 min at 4 ?C (Hettich Zentrifugen, Mikro 200R). Then, the absor-
bance of the supernatant was measured at a wavelength of
600 nm and the value obtained compared with that of the mem-
brane permeates.

2.2.5. Plasmid DNA and RNA quantification
Plasmid DNA and RNA concentrations in lysates, were obtained

by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) [5]. Briefly, a 15
PHE PE column (Amersham Biosciences – GE Healthcare) connected
to an AKTA purifier HPLC System was used. The column was ini-
tially equilibrated with 1.5 M (NH4)2SO4 in a 10 mM Tris–HCl buf-
fer (pH 8.00). Prior to the injection, the suspended solids in lysates
were removed by centrifugation, as described in Section 2.2.4.

22 T.R. Correia et al. / Separation and Purification Technology 112 (2013) 20–25
Samples from the supernatants were directly injected in the col-
umn. The injected volume in each run was 20 lL and the samples
were eluted at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min. Two minutes after
the injection, the eluent was instantly changed to 10 mM Tris–HCl
buffer (pH = 8.00), in order to elute bounded species. This concen-
tration was maintained for 5 min before the re-equilibration of the
column, which was carried out with 1.5 M (NH4)2SO4 in a 10 mM
Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.00), in order to prepare the column for the
next run. The absorbance of the eluate at 260 nm was monitored.
The concentration of pDNA in each sample was calculated from
the area of the pDNA peak and a calibration curve, obtained with
pure pVAX1-lacZ standard solutions.

The filtration yield, in each test, was calculated as the ratio of
the amount of pDNA in the whole collected permeate to the
amount of pDNA in the lysate. The RNA removal was calculated
as 1 ? (VpCRNA,p)/(VlysCRNA,lys) where CRNA,p is the RNA concentration
in the whole collected permeate and CRNA,lys is the RNA concentra-
tion in the lysate, Vp is the whole volume of permeate collected and
Vlys is the volume of lysate processed in each run.
2.2.6. Scanning electron microscopy
The morphology of the membranes was analyzed by scanning

electron microscopy (SEM). Samples were air-dried overnight and
then mounted on an aluminum board using a double-side adhesive
tape and covered with gold using an Emitech K550 (London,
England) sputter coater. The samples were analyzed using a Hitachi
S-2700 (Tokyo, Japan) scanning electron microscope operated at an
accelerating voltage of 20 kV and at different amplifications [21].

The diameter distribution of the nanofibers in the ENMs was
determined from 50 measurements, at least, using ImageJ (National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda (MD), USA).

2.2.7. Attenuated total reflectance-fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy

PEO, SA, PCL and polymer coated ENMs spectra were acquired in
the range of 4000–500 cm?1, using a JASCO 4200 FTIR spectropho-
tometer, operating in ATR mode (MKII GoldenGate™ Single
Reflexion ATR System). Data collection was performed with a
4 cm?1 spectral resolution and after 64 scans [24].

2.2.8. Contact angle
Contact angles of the membranes were determined using a Data

Physics Contact Angle System OCAH 200 apparatus, operating in sta-
tic mode. For each sample, water drops were placed at various
locations of the analyzed surface, at room temperature. The
reported contact angles are the average of at least three
measurements.

2.2.9. Membrane porosity
The surface porosity of the membranes was estimated from

SEM images using the image analysis software, ImageJ. The total
porosity of the membranes was measured through the determina-
tion of the amount of ethanol absorbed by wet membranes, after
1 h of immersion in that solvent, using the following equation [25]:

3. Results and discussion

3.1. ENMs characterization

The morphology of the membranes, namely in terms of fiber
diameter distribution, fiber average diameter and surface porosity
was analyzed from SEM images. As can be seen in Fig. 2 the ENMs
produced present a high density of deposited fibers, in particular
after deposition of the second layer of nanofibers.

Fiber diameter distributions are shown in Fig. 3. The PCL sup-
port has nanofibers with different diameters (200 nm – 2 lm)
and this range of fiber diameters is adequate for obtaining a good
mechanical support [26]. The polymer-coated ENM presents a
higher density of thin fibers (i.e., fibers with 200–300 nm of diam-
eter) than the polymer-uncoated ENM (i.e., the PCL support) which
contributes to a decrease in the dimensions of the interstices. The
number average fiber diameter of the uncoated ENMs can be esti-
mated to be 720 nm and that of the coated membranes to be
430 nm. The commercial microfiltration membranes have typical
values of pore diameter for this type of membranes, 0.22 lm and
0.45 lm for the Nylaflo and FSM0.45PP, respectively (nominal val-
ues given by the manufacturers).
Fig. 4. Surface and total porosity of the ENMs and the commercial microfiltration
membranes.
The porosity of the membranes is analyzed in Fig. 4. As can be
seen, the ENMs have porosities comparable to that of the 0.22 lm
Nylaflo membranes which have been found to perform very satisfac-
tory in the filtration of lysates from plasmid pVAX1-lacZ fermenta-
tion [5]. The porosity of the 0.45 lm membrane used is clearly lower
than that of the other membranes studied herein.

An ATR-FTIR analysis of the membranes was also carried out to
check for the presence of the coating layer. The ATR-FTIR spectra of
SA, PEO, PCL and the PCL/SA ENM (polymer coated ENM) can be
seen in Fig. 5. The spectrum of SA shows its characteristic absorp-
tion band in the region between 1610 cm?1 and 1560 cm?1, which
is due to COO? groups [27] (spectrum 1). The spectrum of PEO
(spectrum 2) shows the characteristic bands of ACH2A groups in
the region between 2990 cm?1 and 2850 cm?1 [28]. The third spec-
trum is that of PCL, which shows an absorption band between
1750 cm?1 and 1740 cm?1 due to C@O groups [29]. The spectrum
of the polymer coated ENM (spectrum 4), shows the characteristic
peaks of the functional groups of the polymers used in membrane
production, previously mentioned, therefore indicating that a thin
layer of PEO/SA was deposited on the PCL support. Moreover, a

much higher intensity peak around 3300 cm?1 was observed, due
to the over-abundance of AOH groups in the coating layer, as pre-
viously described in the literature [30,31].

In order to further characterize the surface properties of the
membranes, water contact angles were also determined to evalu-
ate the hydrophilicity of the membranes. This is an important
property when considering the filtration of suspensions with high
organic load; in fact, it is well-known that hydrophilic membranes
generally perform better than hydrophobic due to adsorption phe-
nomena [32]. The obtained contact angles are indicated in Table 1.
As can be seen, the uncoated PCL membrane presented a high con-
tact angle of 104?, which is indicative of a hydrophobic character.
After coating it with PEO/SA the contact angle decreased to 16.8?,
which is a very similar value to that of the Nylaflo membrane.
The contact angle of the FSM0.45PP membrane is also very high,
although lower than that of the uncoated PCL ENM. Herein, the fil-
tration tests performed with this membrane aimed to check the ef-
fect of the pore size on the permeate turbidity and permeability
recover after filtration.
3.2. Membrane filtration studies

3.2.1. Hydraulic permeability
The results obtained in the permeability tests are summarized

in Fig. 6. As can be seen, the coated PCL ENM produced have
Lp0 values near 5000 L/h m

2 bar, which are of the same order of
magnitude of those found for the Nylaflo membrane. The hydraulic
permeability of the FSM0.45PP is clearly lower, which is possibly
due to its lower porosity and also its higher hydrophobicity, as sug-
gested by the results obtained from contact angle measurements.
3.2.2. Microfiltration of lysates
After the cell lysis procedure is completed, using the previously

described method, a suspension containing a large quantity of pre-
cipitates and cell debris is formed, nearly 2.4 g of suspended solids
per gram (wet weight) of cells, as described elsewhere [33]. In re-
spect to solids removal, the coated PCL ENMs and the Nylaflo mem-
branes gave identical results. Practically, all solids were removed
during the filtration, as can be seen by the turbidity measurements
(Table 2). This indicates that both membranes have a similar aver-
age pore size. The fact that the uncoated ENMs have a lower solids
retention than the coated is in agreement with their higher average

fiber diameter, considering that the dimensions of the interstices
between fibers becomes smaller as the fiber diameter decreases.

In respect to the process yield, in a previous study, where the
same lysis method was used the Nylaflo membranes presented
high yields for the recovery of pVAX1-lacZ from the obtained
lysates [5]. Using both coated and uncoated ENMs, high recovery
yields were also obtained herein, as indicated in Fig. 7. In addition,
the results also reveal that a significant RNA removal can be
achieved using the ENMs, reaching approximately 30% with
the PCL coated ENM. It is possible that the structural differences
between ENMs and conventional microfiltration membranes can
explain the improved selectivity of the ENMs.

With the FSM0.45PP membrane the highest RNA removal was
found, however, much lower yields are also obtained. The occur-
rence of severe fouling is likely to be the cause of the higher reten-
tion of both pDNA and RNA. In fact, after a few minutes of filtration
with this membrane, the permeate pump was unable to impose the
predetermined flow of 0.5 mL/min (73 L/h m2), which is indicative
of the intense fouling. In order to accomplish the filtration, the stir-
red cell had to be connected to a pressurized nitrogen reservoir
containing the diafiltration buffer; the applied pressure on the feed
was adjusted to 0.5 bar and the permeate pump was disconnected.
The permeate flux decreased from 140 L/h m2 to near 20 L/h m2 by
the end of the diafiltration. Fluxes were determined from the vol-
ume of permeate collected as a function of time.

The fouling tendency of the different membranes can be better
evaluated by comparing the recovery of hydraulic permeability
after filtration, i.e., after replacing the lysate suspension inside
the cell with water and then, measuring the water permeability
(without subjecting the membranes to any cleaning procedure).
The ratio Lp/Lp0, is a measure of the tendency of the membranes
to foul; the obtained values are shown in Fig. 8. As can be seen,
the coated PCL ENMs recovered almost completely their initial per-
meability upon filtration of the lysates. This indicates that the pro-
duced membranes are highly resistant to fouling by the cell debris
and other suspended solids present in the lysates.

The differences between the coated and uncoated ENMs should
be also pointed out, with the results clearly showing the impor-
tance of the PEO/SA layer in preventing membrane fouling. The de-
crease in the average fiber size may have contributed to a better
performance of the coated membranes, by avoiding the accumula-
tion of solids between the fibers, inside the electrospun films.
However, the decisive factor affecting membrane performance is
more likely to be the increase in hydrophilicity, as it is suggested

from the fact that both the uncoated ENMs and the FSM0.45PP
membranes (that had the highest contact angles) present the
lowest Lp/Lp0 values.
4. Conclusion

In this work a bi-layer membrane was produced, by deposition
of a PEO/SA layer on a PCL support. Both layers were produced by
electrospinning. Electrospun nanofibers that have been previously
used in a practical and cost-effective way for the production of
polymer scaffolds, are shown here to be also suitable to be used
as microfiltration membranes, for processing complex suspensions
of solids, with high fouling potential (which is the case of cell ly-
sates). The bi-layer arrangement provided both the selectivity
and hydrophilicity required for this application. In fact, the exper-
imental results point out that the bi-layer ENM produced can per-
form, at least, at the same level as commercial microfiltration
membranes, showing a comparable selectivity for retaining the
suspended solids while allowing the total permeation of the solute
of interest (i.e., the plasmid), with an improved selectivity to retain
RNA and an even better resistance to fouling. Moreover, the mem-
branes produced are environmentally friendly due to their known
biodegradability.
