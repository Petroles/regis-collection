Abstract

This dissertation comprises of three articles. The first article, “Risk Taking in Tourna-

ments”, considers a dynamic tournament model where players choose how to spend their

time in activities that involve risk. The second article, “Unitizac?a?o de Jazidas de Petro?leo:

agreement under a common-pool problem where the production cost is uncertain. The

third article, “Oilfield Unitization Under Dual Fiscal Regime: The Regulator Role over

the Bargaining”, by its turn, studies the unitization when there exist two different fiscal

regimes and how firms are benefited by this distortion, and the role of the regulator in

the profit sharing contract.

Chapter 1

Risk Taking in Tournaments

Abstract

We study a tournament model where players must decide how to allocate their

time in different activities, associated with different levels of risk. At first, we

describe and study the static version of the model, where there is an optimal choice

of variance that induces the highest expected output. Under a piece-rate, this would

be the choice of the player, but under tournaments, players deviate from this choice

to increase the probability of winning. In the dynamic setting, we show how a

player seeks more or less risk as the games comes to the end. Finally, we presents

the tie-break rule as a way the principal can improve the expected output.

1.1 Introduction

Many real-world compensation schemes grant prizes depending on agent’s performance

relative to others. This situation is called tournaments in economics. There are a wide

variety of situations where we can find tournaments-like compensations. Students are

graded relatively to their peers, and those who have good grades can be benefited directly

by scholarships and grants, or indirectly through networking that became available due

to the good grades. Research and development can also be thought as a tournament,

where the firm that submit the most attractive proposal is rewarded by a contract. The

elections, when candidates run for a position in the government by competing during

their campaign. The investment flow in the financial market, where the hedge funds

that perform better receive inflows of new investment money. A loan officer who choose

different projects and those who perform better can be promoted. The practice of law,

where attorneys compete to each other during a trial representing their clients and being

evaluated by their performance in other to win a legal dispute. The large salaries of

executives may provide incentives for all individuals in the firm who, with hard labor,

may win one of the coveted top positions. Competition among employees within a firm is



12

among the most widespread ways to provide incentives and granting higher salary, bonus

and promotions.

The contract theory literature has embraced tournaments as a descriptive model

of incentives within firms. Workplace contests are among the most common motivating

applications of the theoretical tournament literature. Tournaments among workers can

mitigate incentive problems when the effort of workers is unobservable. A key idea un-

derlying tournament theory is that there are clear winners and losers, and the rewards

are usually indivisible, so the knowledge of it provides the incentives agents need to effort

towards firms’ goals, if the mechanism is well set. The incentive comes from the rational-

ity of the players who seek to maximize their individual utility by increasing the chance

of winning a prize. In contrast with other forms of remuneration, such as piece rates –

where players are paid according to their production –, tournaments may involve lower

information costs. It is generally cheaper to track the relative performance levels rather

than to monitor absolute performance levels, especially when it involves few competitors.

For example, PhD programs and employers skim through the information available of the

applicants, and carefully evaluate only the very top of them. This is especially true when

employees are compared in order to be rewarded, since it can isolate the common shocks

that might occurred during the evaluation period. The piece rate could provide the wrong

compensation for players’ effort, or the employer would need to be informed about the

market conditions before cross off the aggregate shock term from their performance. The

relative performance evaluation removes the risk of common uncertainty, so it can reduce

the amount of money paid to players, since it also work as an insurance. Both players

and principal know the maximum and the least amount of money they will spend/earn.

Although tournaments offers many advantages in different contexts, it can also be

dangerous when it consists in a multi-period tournament. A dynamic tournament can

provide the wrong incentives for players to exert effort. In many real-world situation,

tournaments are played in a dynamic background. Sports is the most common example,

where players competes over time and at each instant of time, they know whether they

are leading or lagging in a game. We can also find examples in the labor market, where

salespeople competing for a bonus or promotion are subject to a tournament that takes

into account the whole months sales, and at each day or week, players are informed about

his and the others sales level. The salesperson who is behind his peers can be discourage to

exert effort, since it will be unlikely that he can overcome them and it will be more costly

to work hard enough for reach them. The theory shows that if players are evaluated over a

multi-period tournament, and at each period, they learn their relative performance, it can

discourages effort by players, once the probability of winning reduces when an opponent

has an advantage. In this case, the underdog may reduce his effort in the game because

the marginal effect over the probability of winning is reduced and exerting effort is costly.



13

Nevertheless, effort may not be the only choice an agent has while competing in a

tournament. In sports, a coach and his team can choose different levels of risk in a game,

for example, in a soccer match the team losing the game can switch a defense player for

an offensive player to increase the probability of scoring a goal. We can also observe it

in other sports, like in a hockey game, when a team switch the goalie for a line player,

or in car racing, where the driver can choose risky paths to overcome someone ahead of

him. Not only in sports we can observe it, but also in many other situations, like labor

market and financial market. An employee can exert risky tasks in order to increase his

chance to be promoted, like a loan officer that selects different projects to finance and his

reward depends on the return of his loans compare to the other officers. An investment

fund that balances its portfolio based on expected return and risk. A CEO can affect the

riskiness of the company’s production and profit, based on his choice of research project,

the kind of employee he selects and the market he would like to explore, in addition to

deciding how hard they will work.

In the investment funds industry, for example, firms face a trade-off between ex-

pected return and risk of their portfolio. It is also possible that two different portfolios

have the same expected return, but different volatility. There might be an optimal way to

balance the portfolio, in terms of expected return adjusted by the risk of it. However, in a

tournament players can be encouraged to seek more risk than the one that generates the

highest expected return, in order to increase the probability of wining during a dynamic

competition. Funds are evaluated periodically, and when it lacks performance relative

to other funds, it may have incentives to deviate from the optimal choice of expected

return and increase the risk of their portfolio in order to increase its probability of being

the top performer and thus receiving larger amount of investment flow. We can also see

this the trade-off between risk and expected output in other activities, for example, an

advertisement sales, in which salespeople spend their time contacting the usual clients or

they can spend time in prospecting new clients.

In this paper we study a tournament situation in which players must choose how

spend their time in different activities. Each activity has an expected output and volatility

that generated the trade-off between risk and expected return. In the literature of risk

taking in tournament, the choice of risk is costless, so players increase the variance as

much as possible in order to reduce the marginal gain from effort and thus avoid making

any costly effort, the so-called risky-lazy equilibrium. Some authors work with a binary

choice of variance to avoid this equilibrium. In our setting, players have a time constrain

and must choose how to spend their time between two activities. Both activities have

stochastic output, but one of them is riskier. In the static setting, we found that when a

player has some advantage, they would deviate from the way that generates the maximum

expected output. By doing it, players would be decreasing or increasing their product



14

volatility seeking to increase their probability of winning. Our main goal is to model the

dynamic behavior during a tournament. In a dynamic setting, we found that players’

behavior towards risk evolves overtime, and as the game is near the end, players will seek

more risk if there are losing, and will avoid risk if they are leading. To the best of our

knowledge, this behavior was not modeled yet, though it is a common wisdom.

Next section we will survey the related literature about tournament theory with risk

taking. Section 1.3 we describe the model and compute the equilibrium for the static case.

Sections 1.3.4 and 1.4 we describe the tournament with two and ? periods, respectively.

The Section 1.5 we consider the static case again, and discuss the assumption about the

symmetric expected output function and what would happen if we relax this assumption.

We also present a tie-break rule, so in order to win the prize they must perform much

more than their opponent. We show numerically how the principal can improve players’

output by setting correctly the tie-break rule.

1.2 Related Literature

The formal study of this reward structure has started with Lazear and Rosen (1981),

in a labor market model. They provide an alternative model to understand why some

employees earns much more after a promotion, even though they perform a similar job

without increasing his marginal productivity. The idea is that players can be encouraged

to effort by competing against their peers for a promotion or wage rise. Their paper shows

that tournament schemes can implement first-best levels of effort, when agents are risk

neutral and the prizes are carefully chosen.

This type of contract is commonly used in the labor market, so economists have been

trying to understand why. Green and Stokey (1983) provide us two initial reasons why

tournament contracts are so common, besides the fact that using tournaments requires less

information. In their model, risk averse players competes in a rank order contract, where

the principal optimally determines the prizes. They show that under a sufficiently diffuse

common shock, the use of tournaments dominates the optimal independent contracts,

since tournaments allow the principal to filter out the common shock. In addition, when

the number of agents increase and the principal cannot observe the common shock and

uses a rank order contract can do as well as a principal could do when he observes the

common shock and uses an independent optimal contract. Although these cases seems

to be extreme, Nalebuff and Stiglitz (1983) show that in a contest with two risk neutral

players, the first best optimum can be obtained by choosing appropriately the prizes,

and also show that even a two-player contest can dominate the individual linear payment

schedule when players are independent. The authors also present more properties about

the second best solution. Tournament-like contracts can induce players to effort more



15

than they do in the first best solution, but it would require the principal to compensate

them in order encourages them to participate in the contest. Furthermore, introducing

a tie-break rule, it is possible to improve the tournament solution with respect to the

principal outcome.

However, in the real world the effort is not the only possible choice that workers

have. Sometimes agents can influence both the spread of distribution of the output and

the distribution mean. For example, a loan officer chooses projects with different expected

returns and risks, managers can choose innovative or conservative technology strategies

and fund managers can choose the riskiness and expected returns of their portfolio. To

the best of our knowledge, Bronars (1987) was the first to consider the idea of player

manipulating the risk to increase the probability of winning. The first published paper

about risk taking in tournament is Hvide (2002), which studies the incentives for risk

seeking by the identical players in a symmetric equilibrium. Since the choice of risk

is costless in his model, players choose the maximum variance in order to reduce the

costly effort they must do to overcome the opponent. Increasing variance in a symmetric

case will reduce the incentives to do a costly effort, since the marginal increase in the

probability of winning by increasing effort is low. Therefore, when players are identical,

this compensation scheme induces a “risky-lazy” equilibrium, where both players choose

infinity variance and zero effort.

Two papers that studied the asymmetry of player are Kra?kel and Sliwka (2004),

and Kra?kel (2008), by considering different players’ abilities. They introduce a two-stage

model, where players choose the risk level, which is costless, and then the costly effort.

According to them, the choice of variance has two effects: (i) the effort effect, which

is the reduction of the importance of the effort due to the larger level of noise in the

output, and hence, players can reduce their effort level; and (ii) likelihood effect, which

is the change in the probability of winning related to the choice of risk. They show that

if the leader has a large enough advantage, he would chose low-risk strategy, while the

underdog’s choice depends on the cost of effort. When the cost is high, the underdog

will choose high-risk strategy. If the advantage is not so large, the underdog will always

choose high-risk strategy, while the leader would choose high-risk strategy when the effort

cost is low. Gilpatric (2009) presents a model more closely related to ours, in the sense

he introduces a costly choice of risk, and propose a penalty that the last placed player

must bear, and thus it reduces the excessive risk taking by players in a tournament and

control the productive effort, but he does not explore the dynamic effect of risk taking.

Tournament in real life are usually dynamic, in the sense that players compete

against each other in more than just one period, and usually at each period they learn

their position before taking an action. Ederer (2010) and Aoyagi (2010) studied how the



16

midterm information affects players’ decision in the last period of a two-stage tournament,

where the risk choice is not available for the players. Since the output is stochastic, in

the beginning of the second period one of the players will have an advantage, and if the

information about the advantage is fully disclosed, then both players will have incentives

to reduce effort. For the underdog, the marginal gain in the probability of winning is

reduced and the cost to exert effort to tie the leader’s advantage is high. However, if

the principal does not reveal the information about the advantage, players would be less

heterogeneous, and thus they would exert more effort than in the full disclose information

tournament.

Cabral (2003) and Anderson and Cabral (2007) are the first to study a dynamic

tournament where players’ decision involve choosing the variance of an output. They

consider an infinite time horizon, where players receive a payoff for each instant of time

depending on their position. The background for their model is the research and develop-

ment competition in an oligopolistic industry. Two players choose the volatility of their

product quality at each instant, and receive a payoff according to the quality difference.

Since the game has no end, players choice depends only on the previous quality difference

and their patience. The linearity of their model results in a bang-bang solution, and their

findings are that for sufficiently patient player, the underdog (or laggard) chooses high

risk, while the leader will choose low-variance strategy.

Many authors have empirically studied the problem of risk taking in tournaments.

Brown et al. (1996) and Chevalier and Ellison (1997) study the mutual fund industry

and associate the risk taking by the managers of investment portfolios to the relative

performance evaluation. Funds charge investors a percentage of their investment, called

the management fee, and thus mutual fund companies seeks increase the total amount of

asset. Chevalier and Ellison (1997) first study the relationship between the inflow of new

investment into a mutual fund and the funds historic performance. They estimate how

the market implicitly compensates funds for increasing the riskiness of their portfolios

toward the end of the year as a function of the funds’ performance from January to

September year-to-date, age, and other characteristics. The expected inflow is shown to

be non-decreasing function of the previous excess return of the funds, and it presents a

convex shape when the returns exceed the market by 15 to 22 points. Therefore, this

pattern shows that very large returns bring higher flows as a fund starts to make annual

“best fund” lists, and gain more attention from potential investors. Secondly, they show

that funds that are somewhat behind the market have an incentive to gamble and try to

catch up, while funds that are somewhat ahead of the market have an incentive to lock

in their gains. However, at the extreme points the incentive reverse. Finally, they show

that mutual funds alter their portfolios between September and December in a manner

consistent with the September incentives to take risk.



17

Genakos and Pagliero (2012) empirically study the impact of interim rank on risk

taking using data from weightlifting competitions. In this sport, players must announce

the weight they will attempt to lift at the beginning of each stage. The authors consider

the relative increase of the announcements as a measure of risk, that is, how much a player

increased his announcement from the previous one relative to the player placed first. In

order to evaluate the players’ behavior towards the risk, they estimate three different

models: (i) Announcement vs Ranking; (ii) Announcement vs Absolute distance from

competitors; and (iii) Announcement vs Intensity of the Competition. In the first model,

they found an inverted-U relationship between the announcement and interim ranking,

that is, the announcements increase from the first to sixth place but then decrease for

further decreases in rank. One possible reason for riskier strategies for the third and fourth

rank is the prize discontinuity between them, which provides incentives to take risk. In

the model (ii), they found the expected relationship between risk taking and distance from

competitors. A player choose riskier strategy when the competitor in front is close and the

trailing player is far. On the other hand, a player reduces the risk when the competitor

in front is far and the one trailing is close. Finally, in the model (iii), they measure the

intensity of competition by the number of athletes that are close to each other, and they

found that more intense competitions stimulates more risk taking. However, Genakos and

Pagliero (2012) did not consider how risk taking by the competitors evolves along the

time, since their main concern was to evaluate how ranking affects the risk taking.

Although it is a common wisdom players’ behavior in a dynamic tournament, to the

best of our knowledge, no theoretical study has modeled how players seek more or less

risk as the game is near the end. The main purpose of this paper is to evaluate players’

behavior in the dynamic tournaments. At first, we will introduce the static model, in which

one player has an exogenous advantage at the beginning of the period, and evaluate how

players seek risk. In Section 1.4 we present the dynamic model, where players start the

tournament at the same position, and thus the advantage becomes endogenous. Next

section we describe the basic model in a static setting, where the advantage is exogenous.

We show the tournament incentives leads to inefficiency, and show how players behave in

the equilibrium.

1.3 The Static Model

In this section, we study a tournament model in which one player may have an advantage

relative to his opponent, in terms of production level, and how it affects the risk taking

by players.

1.3.1 Environment

We consider two players (? = ?,?) competing for a prize ? &gt; 0, which is granted to

the player who produces the most, while the other player receives zero payoff. The tour-

nament setting has the following timing: First, players learn their initial (dis)advantage,

represented by ?1 as the initial advantage of player ?, and choose their action. The out-

put is realized and the principal gives the prize to the player with highest output, after

observing it. The loser does not receive anything.

The production is a stochastic function of how players spend their time. There are

two activities that players can engage in order to produce output, denoted by ? ? {?,?}.
Each of them generates the same expected output per unit of time spent on it, given by

the strictly increasing and concave function ?(·), so it presents a diminishing marginal
output and the player could produce more by working in both activities. The activity ?

is riskier than activity ?, in the sense that the task ? volatility per unit of time spent on

it is higher than the volatility of task ?. Let ? be the amount of time spent on activity

?, the output generated by this task follows a Normal distribution with mean ?(?) and

variance ??2?, i.e. ?
?
? ? ?(?(?),??

2
?), where ?

2
? &gt; ?

2
? .

Each player has ? units of time available to allocate in both of activities. Let ?? be the

amount of time player ? spends on the riskier activity, ?, thus ? ??? is the amount of time
spent on the “safe” task, ?. After players learn ?1, they choose simultaneously how to spend

their time by choosing ?? ? [0,?]. Observe that for each possible time allocation by player
?, the output ? ? generated by a choice ?? follows a Normal distribution with mean ?(??? ) ?
?(??) + ?(? ? ??) and variance ???2? + (? ? ??) ?2? . The outputs are independent, since
the random term is independent between players and tasks. Therefore, the total output

produce by player ? follows a Normal distribution, ? ? ? ? (?(??),???2? + (? ? ??) ?2? ))

Note that the variance of the output is basically a convex combination between ?2?

and ?2? , where the weights are the time allocated in each activity. The function ? is even

with respect to ?/2, i.e. ?(?) = ?(? ? ?), and thus we have the following two properties:
(i) ??(?) = ? ?(?) ? ? ?(? ? ?) = ???(? ? ?), so the inclination of ? for two different points



19

equidistant to ?/2 has the same magnitude but with different sign, and; (ii) ?(·) is strictly
increasing in [0,?/2) and strictly decreasing in (?/2,?].

We can see that the maximum expected output is attained when ? ?(??) = ? ?(? ???),
and since ?(·) is strictly increasing, the maximum is achieved when ?? = ?/2 = ? ? ??.
The Figure 1.2 shows us the function ?, which is equivalent to the set of possible choices

a player has.

Figure 1.2: Set of Possible Choices

Since the choice of how the time is allocated allocation is costless, in any payment

scheme based on production, one would expected that the player would choose the alloca-

tion that maximize the output, i.e., ?? = ?/2. However, in a tournament payment scheme,

when a player is in disadvantage he might be willing to increase variance of his output in

order to increase the chance of getting a higher output.

1.3.2 Tournaments Incentives

A tournament is a compensation scheme in which contestant’s rewards are based on their

ordinal position alone and not on the actual size of their output. This scheme pays

? &gt; 0 to the player with highest output and zero to the second player. Players decide

simultaneously their action, seeking to increase their probability of winning the prize,

which depends on player ? and ? choices and the distribution of the random variables

that affects both players output. If we introduce an advantage to player ?, denoted by

?1, formally we have,

max
??

?P
[?
?1 + ?

?(??) &gt; ? ?(??)
]?

(1PP?)

We can use the properties that the sum of Normal distributions is a Normal distri-



20

bution, and rewrite the objective function, using the time constraint as

P
[?
?1 + ?

]?

= ?

(?
?1 + ?(?

?) ? ?(??)??
(?? + ??) ?2? + (2? ? ?? ? ??)?2?

,

where ? is the standard Normal cumulative distribution function. In order to ease the

notation, denote

?2 =
(?
?? + ??

)?
?2? + (2? ? ?

? ? ??)?2?

and

? =
?1 + ?(?

?) ? ?(??)
?

.

In order to see the incentives behind a tournament scheme, we will study the first

order condition of the player ?, which is the following

0 =
?

?
?(?)

[?
? ?(??) ? ? ?(? ? ??) ?

?2? ? ?2?
2?

?

]?
?? ? ?(??) ? ? ?(? ? ??) =

?2? ? ?2?
2?

?.

(1.1)

As we can see in the above equation, it is not necessarily true that player maximize

the expected output, i.e. it’s not always true that ? ?(??) ? ? ?(? ? ??) = 0. This would
happen if their contract was based on output production, but since they are working

under a relative performance evaluation (RPE) contract, a distortion can happen and

the best response for the player will not be to maximize expected output anymore. In a

tournament, players want to maximize their probability of winning the prize by allocating

their time in two activities. The leader would want to remain with the advantage to win

the game, so he is willing to sacrifice some of the expected output in order to reducing the

risk. By doing it, the noise effect over leader advantage is reduced. On the other hand,

the underdog would be willing to sacrifice some of the expected product he would get by

maximizing the output, in order to increase the volatility of his output. Thus, he would

be reducing the effect of the disadvantage.

Figure 1.3 illustrates the general idea about incentives in tournaments, when a player

has an advantage towards the other. Suppose player ? starts with 1.5 units of output

in the beginning of the game, while the other player has no output yet. In this simple

example, the figure shows the probability player ? wins when they both decide to produce

at the same expected output, but with different levels of risk. In this example, player ?

would prefer to reduce his risk, by choosing the variance equals to ?2. On the other hand,

the underdog who is losing by 1.5, we can see his probability of winning on the left side of

the figure, where the vertical line intercepts ?1.5. In his case, he would be better choosing



21

higher risk, so the initial disadvantage has lower influence over the outcome.

Figure 1.3: Probability of Player ? win the Tournament

In the next subsection, we will provide different ways to read the first order condition

from (1.1).

Return on Time Allocation

We can rewrite the Equation (1.1) in terms of marginal return of the time allocate to each

activity, and we can see the each player equates the marginal return of the risky and safe

activity, as shown by the following equation:

? ?(??) ?
?2?
2?
? = ? ?(? ? ??) ?

?2?
2?
?. (1.2)

This equation shows on l.h.s. the marginal return of allocating an additional fraction of

the time on the risky activity, while the r.h.s. the same for safe activity. Note that since

?2? &gt; ?
2
? , the (dis)advantage affects more the risky choice. The Figure 1.4 illustrates this

equation.

Figure 1.4: Player ? first order condition

Notes: To plot this figure, it was used ?? = 1
2
, ?2? = 1, ?

2
? = 2 and

?(?) =
?
?.



22

Note that Figure 1.4 is based on the risky activity time allocation, i.e. ??. There-

fore, this plot can be interpreted as the marginal benefit of the spending time at the risky

activity (red line) versus the marginal cost of opportunity to allocate time in this activity

(blue line), which is given by the marginal benefit of spending time at the safe activity.

First note that they are not symmetric, since ?2? &gt; ?
2
? , hence one player will be willing to

deviate from the maximal expected output time allocation, whenever there is a disadvan-

tage. If player ? starts with an advantage ?1 &gt; 0, we will see that ? &gt; 0, so working an

additional time on the risky task will negatively affect his probability of winning, because

?2? &gt; ?
2
? . We plotted two possible values for ?1, one positive (i.e. player ? has advantage)

and one negative (i.e. player ? has advantage). We can see that when the player ? has an

advantage, the best response for him is to allocate more time in the safe activity ?? &amp;lt;?/2,

while when he is losing he prefers to work more on risky activities. We can also see that

the risky activity is more sensitive with variations on ?1, since ?
2
? &gt; ?

2
? .

1.3.3 Equilibrium

In the previous section, we analyzed the best response of a player, and it was shown

the effects of the advantage and the variance in this model. Now, we will characterize

the Nash equilibrium of this static tournament. From Equation (1.1) we have the best

response of player ?. For player ?, the only change is that the probability of winning is

1 ? ?(?), and thus, the system to be solved has the following equations:

? ?(??) ? ? ?(? ? ??) =
?2? ? ?2?

2?
? and ? ?(??) ? ? ?(? ? ??) = ?

?2? ? ?2?
2?

? (1.3)

Proposition 1 A pure-strategy equilibrium exists, if the following condition holds:

inf

The players’ equilibrium choice will satisfy the following equations:

?(?2? + ?

2
? )

and ??(??) = ?
?2? ? ?2?

2

?(?2? + ?

(1.5)

Proof. Note that ? is a strictly increasing function, so we are interested in maximizing

it’s argument, defined by

? =
?1 + ?(?

?) ? ?(??)
?



23

A sufficient condition for a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium to exist is that ? strictly

concave in player ? choice given any choice of his opponent. The existence is guarantee if

???(??) ? ?????
??(??)

???
&amp;lt;0, for all ?? and ??,

where ??? is the partial derivative of ? with respect to ?
? and ????? is the second order

partial derivative of ? with respect to ??. This condition holds if ??(??) = 0, since

? is a concave function. If ??(??) &amp;lt;0, this condition also holds, because ? is a strictly

increasing and concave function in ?. When ??(??) &gt; 0, a sufficient condition to guarantee

the existence is

inf
??

????
???(??)

??(??)

????
&gt; sup

??,??

????
?????

???

????
.

Since ?? ? [0,?], the right-hand side is equal to (?2???2? )/2??2? , thus we have the condition
(1.4). The condition for player ? is the same, but ?? needs to be concave in ??. Assuming
that (1.4) holds, we can characterize the equilibrium by using the first order condition.

We can rewrite the Equation (1.3) using the function ?(·) and equalize them, so we
find ??(??) = ???(??). But using that ??(?) = ???(? ? ?), we rewrite the equilibrium
condition as ??(??) = ??(? ? ??), and since ? is strictly concave, we have ?? = ? ? ??, or
?? + ?? = ?.1 We now rewrite ?2 = ?(?2? + ?

2
? ) and thus at the equilibrium we have

? =
?1??

?(?2? + ?
2
? )
,

thus we have the equations (1.5).

This proposition shows how players behave depending on the initial advantage ?1.

If ?1 is positive, it means that player ? is ahead of player ?, and that ?
?(??) &gt; 0, that is,

player ? will choose ?? &amp;lt;?/2, so he is allocating more time on the safe activity, in order

to reduce the volatility of his output. On the other hand, if ?1 is negative, so player ? is

behind player ?, we will have the opposite behavior, that is, he will seek risky activity in

order to increase his output volatility, so he can increase the probability of winning the

game.

The idea is that whenever a player has some advantage, ‘his probability of winning

the tournament is greater than 1/2. In order to maintain his advantage, he avoids allo-

cating time to risky activity, since it would increase the variance of his output and thus

reduce the probability of winning the tournament. On the other side, the player with dis-

advantage has the opposite incentive, since he could increase his probability of winning by

increasing the output variance. However, if no one has any advantage, then both players

1Just a reminder, ? is strictly concave, thus ?? is strictly monotone.



24

will maximize their expected output.

Figure 1.5 shows the reaction function from both players and the equilibrium when

?1 &gt; 0, that is, player ? starts with an advantage. The figure is plotted in the following

way: The blue line is the reaction function for player ?, the abscissa contains all possible

choices for player ?, and the line shows player ? best reaction. The red line is the

reaction function for player ?, and the ordinate has all possible choices for player ?. The

intersection of these two lines is the Nash equilibrium for this static tournament. The

yellow dashed line represents the symmetric choices, that is ?? = ??.

In order to maintain his advantage, player ? will allocate more time to safe activities,

reducing the volatility of his output. On the other hand, player ? seeks risky activities

so that he reduces the probability of player ? wins the tournament, since he will be

increasing the variance of his output and of the output difference.

Frontier

Equation (1.5) shows the behavior of the players towards changes in the parameters

of the model. Formally, we can use the implicit differentiation this equation to view the

effect of changes in the parameters. First, note that function ? is strictly concave, so

the derivative of the inverse function of ?? is decreasing. Let us explore this properties

beginning with the advantage effects. As ?1 &gt; 0 increases, the player ?, who has the

advantage, reduces his volatility by allocating more time on safe task, while player ?, the

underdog, seeks for more risk, as we have mentioned before. The Figure 1.6 show us the

players’ choice.



25

Figure 1.6: The Effect of ?1 over players’ Strategy

Formally, we have that

???

??1

?2? ? ?2?
2?(?2? + ?

2

??(??)
&amp;lt;0 and

???

??1
= ?

?2? ? ?2?
2?(?2? + ?

2
? )?

??(??)
&gt; 0. (1.6)

The magnitude of the change clearly depends on advantage, but also depends on

the time endowment, concavity of the expected output and variance parameters. When

the variance associated to the risky activity is relatively large to the safe risk, the player

who has an advantage will seek safer tasks even more, since he tries to reduce his output

volatility, while the underdog do the opposite. The ??? term represents how the marginal

expected output changes at each unit of time allocated on the risk activity. The more

negative is ???, means that a small change on the risk affects more severely the expected

output, so the player who has advantage will avoid reducing too much the risk compared

to the optimal choice of ?/2, since it would have a large negative impact over his expected

output. Finally, the higher is the endowment of time, ?, since it also affects ??? in the

opposite way, thus the overall effect is ambiguous.

The variance associated with the risky activity also affects players’ choice, as ex-

pected. The higher is the variance of such activity, the less the leader will allocate time

on it, since it will reduce his probability of winning. The marginal effect will depend on

the advantage, endowment and on the second derivative of ?. Again, the higher is the

advantage, the more willing the leader will be to reduce the variance of his output, even

though losing in terms of expected output. The ??? term has the same intuition as in the

previous paragraph. The trade-off between allocating time to risk and safe activity now

appears in this marginal effect:

???

??2?
=

?1
???(??)

?2?
?(?2? + ?

2
? )

2
&amp;lt;0 and

???

??2?
= ?

?1
???(??)

?2?
?(?2? + ?

2
? )

2
&gt; 0, (1.7)



26

so, as the variance of the safe activity increases, so the term
?2?

?(?2?+?
2
?)

2 increases, then

the leader will not reduce the time allocation on risk activity too much compared to the

optimal choice ?/2. This happens due to the lower trade-off between allocating time to

the risk and safe activity, measured by the difference ?2? ? ?2? .

Finally, we can study how the endowment affects the equilibrium choices. Now,

the effect over the leader is clear, increasing the time allocated on risk activity, since the

optimal level also increases. However, for the underdog, the effect is not clear. It will

depend on his disadvantage and on the ???.

.

(1.8)

Therefore, we can see that under a tournament scheme, the asymmetry between

players and the possibility to take risk will reduce the total expected output. We can also

see that the larger is the advantage of one player, the other will seek more risk.

1.3.4 Two Periods Tournament Model

In the previous section, we studied the equilibrium of a static tournament, when one of

the player can have an exogenous initial advantage. In this section, we will consider the

two period model, in which all players start at the same level, that is, there will not be

any player with an initial advantage, i.e. ?0 = 0. The objective of this section is to make

the advantage endogenous in the model, in the sense that the advantage at the second

period is the realization of the stochastic output of each agent after each player chose

their time allocation on both tasks.

In the tournament we study in this section, the principal grants the prize ? &gt; 0 to

the player who produce the most, while the other player does not receive anything. This

is a typical case of promotion, where ? can be seen as the increase of the salary for the

promoted player. The output that the principal compares to reward the winner is now the

sum of the each stage output. The first period, both players start with no initial output,

and then choose how to allocate their time endowment ? of the period. The output

is realized at the end of the first period, and players learn their (dis)advantage at the

beginning of the second period, so they can choose the risk of their output strategically,

just as it was solved in the previous section.

In order to solve this problem, we will find the subgame perfect equilibrium by

backward induction. First, we solve the second stage problem for a given initial advantage

at the second period, ?1. We starting solving the second stage, considering that player

learned ?1, that is, the (dis)advantage that player ? has towards player ?. This problem



27

was solved in the Section 1.3.3, so now let us focus on the first stage problem. Player ?

will solve the following problem

max

]?
(2PP?)

where ? ?
*

2 is the player ? output when he plays the equilibrium strategy for the second

period. First, we use the equilibrium conditions to rewrite the output difference in the

second stage:

? ?
*

2 ? ?
?*

2 = ?(?
?*

2 ) ? ?(?
?*

2 ) + ??

(???

?
2?

)?
+ ??

(???
? ? ??*2 ?

?
2? ?

??
? ? ??*2 ?

?
2?

)?
,

since we know that ?(??
*

2 ) = ?(?
?*
2 ) by the symmetry of the model, thus the only impor-

tant part to be considered is the realization of random variables. The difference for the

first period is similar to the first line of the above equation:

? ?1 ? ?
?
1 = ?(?

?
1 ) ? ?(?

?
1 ) + ??

(???
??1 ?

??1 ?

?
1?

)?
+ ??

(???
? ? ??1 ?

?
1? ?

??
? ? ??1 ?

?
1?

)?
,

using the equations above and that ??
*

2 + ?
?*
2 = ? from the equilibrium condition shown

in the proof of the Proposition 1, we can rewrite the probability in the following way

P
[?
? ?1 (?

?
1 ) + ?

?*

2 &gt; ?
?
1 (?

?

?2? (? + ?
?

?

2
? (3? ? ??1 ? ? ? ??1 )

)?
.

Now, let us define ?1 and ?
2
1:

?21 = ?
2
?

(?
? + ??1 + ?

?
1

)?
+ ?2?

(?
3? ? ??1 ? ?

?
1

)?
and

?1 =
?(??1 ) ? ?(??1 )

?1

Clearly, substituting these equation in the player ?’s problem, it is easy to see that

it is similar to the static problem, when ?0 = 0. So, using the proposition 1 we know that

players will maximize their output, by allocating their time equally on both activities,

i.e., each player will spend ??1? =
?/2 units of time on each task. Therefore, we can see that

the (dis)advantage creates incentives for players deviate from the optimal time allocation,

and since part of relative position is due to random variables, players will almost surely

be deviating from the allocation that maximizes the expected output.



28

1.4 The Dynamic Model

A natural extension to the previous section is when the tournament has ? periods. Now,

we will consider a dynamic tournament, in which both players start with the same output

level as before. However, as the tournament develops, a player finds out he is ahead of

the other and take strategical actions to increases his chances of winning the tournament

at each period. The setting is quite similar as the previous one, but now players will be

evaluated after ? periods, and at the end of each period players will learn their position.

Here, the principal compares the sum of the output over the ? periods, and the prize will

be given to the player with the highest output level at the end of period ?.

We consider a ??period dynamic stochastic game with two players (? = ?,?),
where each of them chooses how to spend their time at each period in order to produce

the output ? ?? . The sum of the output over time will be considered by the principal to

determine the winner, who will be granted a prize ? &gt; 0, while the loser gets nothing.

Let ??? = ?
?
? ? ? ?? be the output difference with respect to player ? at period ?, then

the principal will grant the prize to player ? if ?? ?
???

?=0 ??? &gt; 0, otherwise player ?

will receive the prize. Formally, the last period payoff is a function ??? : ? ?? R, where
? ? R is the state space of the game and

??? (?? ) =

?????
????
? , if ?? &gt; 0;

?/2 , if ?? = 0;

0 , otherwise,

and ??? (?? ) =

?????
????
? , if ?? &amp;lt;0;

?/2 , if ?? = 0;

0 , otherwise,

(1.9)

or, as it will be more convenient for computation later, ??? (?? ) = ?1{?? &gt;0}, where 1{?? &gt;0}

is the indicator function that equals 1 when ?? &gt; 0. The utility for player ? is similar,

except that the prize is given when ?? &amp;lt;0. The tournament studied here does not

consider a midterm reward, so the utility function per period ? &amp;lt;? equals zero.

Players make their choice after learning the accumulated output difference ?? ????
?=0 ??? from the end of previous period, that is, the accumulated output difference up

to the beginning of period ?. We assume that at the initial period both players begin the

tournament with no output, thus ?0 = 0. We can rewrite the law of motion as

??+1 = ?? + ?
?
? ? ?

?
? , (1.10)

where the state of the next period ??+1 depends on the current initial state ?? and the

players output ? ?? realization at the end of the period, after players made their decision.

At each period, players can engage in two activities, denoted by ? ? {?,?}, to produce
the output ? ?? , which is a stochastic function of the time spent performing each task. As



29

in the model from Section 1.3, for each unit of time ? spent on an activity, the expected

output will be ?(?), where ?(·) is a strictly increasing and concave function, thus having
the same property as before, diminishing marginal productivity. Also, by working in a

task ?, the player will be subject to output volatility associated with that task, which is

given by ?2??, where ?
2
? &gt; ?

2
? . Therefore, given that the player chooses to spend ? units

of time on activity ?, the output generated by it follows a Normal distribution with mean

?(?) and variance ??2?, that is, ?
?
?? ? ?(?(?),??

2
?).

Both players have ? units of time available to work in both of tasks. Denote ??? ?
[0,?] ? ?? be the amount of time player ? spend on the riskier activity, ?, thus ? ???? is the
amount of time spent on the “safe” task, ?. Due to the diminishing marginal productivity,

players will probably work on both activities, and thus the player ? production ? ?? at the

period ? follows a Normal distribution with mean ?(??? ) ? ?(??? ) + ?(? ? ??? ) and variance
????

2
? + (? ? ??? ) ?2? , i.e. ? ?? ? ?(?(??? ),????2? + (? ? ??? ) ?2? ), since it is the sum of independent

Normal distributions. Again, we assume the players’ output is independently distributed,

hence we can find the transition probability ? : ? × ? ?? ?(?), that is the probability
density of next period be the state ?? given the current players’ choice and state ?, i.e.

?(??; ??,??,?), where ?(?) is the set of probability distributions on the set ?. The
transition function can be found by using the properties from Normal distributions, hence

we have

??+1 ? ?
(?
?? + ?(?

?
? ) ? ?(?

?
? ),?

2
?

(?
??? + ?

?
? ) + ?

2
?

(?
2? ? ??? ? ?

?
?

)?)?
, (1.11)

therefore, ? is the probability density function (pdf) of a Normal distribution given by

(1.11) and we denote ? as its cumulative density function (cdf).

Formally, the game is a tuple [?,(??,??? )?=?,?,?]
?

?=0
, where ? = R for all ? is the

state space, ?? = [0,?] for ? = ?,? is the action space, that is, the players’ endowment of

time and ? : ? × ?? × ?? ? [0,1] is the cumulative distribution of the state transition
function from ?? to ??+1 given a choice (?

?,??).

Therefore, the game proceeds as follows. At period ? = 0, both players learn that

they are starting the game with no initial output, that is, the initial state is ?0 = 0. After

observing the initial state, players choose how to spend their time endowment of ? over

the two tasks, ?0 =
(?
??0 ,?

?
0

)?
, simultaneously and independently from each other. After the

realization of both outputs, the state ?0 transits to state ?1 according to the distribution

mentioned above, that follows the Normal distribution ?(?0 + ?(?
?
0 ) ? ?(??0 ),?2? (??0 +

??0 ) + ?
2
? (2? ? ??0 ? ??0 )). In the next round, at period ? = 1, after observing the state ?1,

players choose how to allocate their time ?1, and after the realization of the outputs, the

state changes again. The game goes on this way for ? ? 1 periods. At the beginning of
period ?, when the outputs are realized, the principal learns who produced the most by



30

observing ?? , and grant the prize ? to player ? if ?? &gt; 0, otherwise player ? wins the

prize ?.

The nature of the tournament, that is the compensation scheme depending only

on the ?? , makes different histories of the game lead to a same states, which is the

variable observed by the players. This property allow us to focus our attention to Markov

strategies. Let ??? : ? ? ?? denote the Markov strategy for period ?, and ??
? ? {???}

?

?=0
the

strategy up to period ?. The complete strategy for the tournament for player ? is denoted

by ?? ? ??? . Now, we can write the expected payoff function based on the strategy profile
? ?

(?
??,??

)?
, given by

?(?) ? E?
[?
??? (?? )

]?
, (1.12)

where E? is the expectation taken with respect to the measure induced by transition
probability ?(·) and the strategy profile ?. The equilibrium concept we use to solve the
game is the Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE), which considers that players condition

their actions only on the current state of the game ??. A strategy profile is a Markov

perfect equilibrium, if the strategy profile is a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium and

the strategies is Markovian. Since we consider a finite horizon game, using the one-shot

deviation principle, we can find the equilibrium by backward induction, so we have the

following definition.

Definition 1 A (nonstationary) Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE) in this setting is a

pair of a finite sequence of value function {? ?? ,? ?? }??=0 and a Markov strategy profile ?
such that

In other words, to carry out backward induction, we start at the last period of



31

players’ action, ? ? 1, and for each possible state ???1 we calculate the time ? ? 1 value
functions and strategies. Next, we move backward one period to time ? ? 2, the expected
value function considers that players will behave according to the strategy found at the

period ? ? 1 in the future, and solve the players’ problem considering the probability
induced by the next period strategies and the decision at the period ? ? 2. We continue
the backward induction recursively for the periods ? ? 3,? ? 4,... until we reach time
period ? = 0, and thus we have the equilibrium strategy profile ?.

Proposition 2 There is a unique interior Markov perfect equilibrium, in which the strat-

egy profile ? is such that ??? satisfies at each period ? the following equation

??(??? ) =
?2? ? ?2?

2

??
(? ? ?) ?(?2? + ?2? )

and ??(??? ) = ??
?(??? ), (1.15)

and the value function for each period ? is given by

? ?? (??) = ??

and ? ?? (??) = ?

if the following condition holds:

?2? ? ?2?

. (1.17)

Proof. At the last period of players’ decision, ? ? 1, the problem is similar to the
one presented in Section 1.3.1. Players learn ???1 and must choose how to spend their

time in order to maximize their probability of winning the tournament, which depends

on the law of motion and the transition distribution. Using the law of motion given by

?? = ???1 + ?
?
??1 ? ?

?
??1, and the Normal distribution of the outputs, the distribution

of ?? will be a Normal distribution with mean ???1 + ?(?

??1) ? ?(?

?

(?

. The objective function from Equation

(1.13) for player ? can be rewritten as

??
??? (?? )?(?? |???1,?

,

since the integrand is the density of a standardize normal distribution in the second line

and we used the property from Normal distribution that 1 ? ?(?) = ?(??). Now it is
clear that both problem from period ? and the static one presented in Section 1.3.1 is



32

the same. Therefore, the Proposition 1 solves the problem to find the strategy profile for

period ? ? 1:

??(????1) =
?2? ? ?2?

2

???1
?(?2? + ?

2
? )

and ??(????1) = ??
?(????1). (1.18)

Due to symmetry of the production function of the activities, ? and ?, ??(????1) = ??
?(????1)

implies that both players will choose an allocation that generates the same expected

output, ?(????1) = ?(?
?
??1), but different levels of risk such that ?

?
??1 + ?

?
??1 = ?, so

?2??1 = ?(?
2
? + ?

2
? ). Using this information, we now can find a closed-form solution for the

last period expected value function,

? ???1(???1) = ??

(?

2
? )

)?
and ? ???1(???1) = ?

[?
1 ? ?

(?

?(?2? + ?
2
? )

)?]?
.

We use the guess-and-verify method to find the value function for the period ?. In

order to find an educated guess, we can compute the probability of winning by each player,

when they play the same strategy of the period ? ? 1, but taking into account that there
will be ? ? ? random variables realizing until the end of the game. So, let the following
function be our guess for the player ?’s value function for period ?,

? ?? (??) = ??

(?
????

(?2? + ?
2
? ) ?(? ? ?)

)?
and ? ?? (??) = ?

[?
1 ? ?

(?
????

(?2? + ?
2
? ) ?(? ? ?)

)?]?
.

(1.19)

We will solve the problem for player ?, since the player ? problem can be done by

the same way. In order to verify the guess for the value function, we move forward in the

time, so we have ? ??+1(??+1) and substituting it in the Equation (1.14), we can solve player

?’s problem. First, let ?*
2

? = (?
2
? + ?

2
? ) ?(? ? ? ? 1), we can rewrite the integral using our

guess as??
?

(?
??+1
?*?+1

)?
1

??
?

(?
??+1 ? ?? ? ?(??? ) + ?(??? )

??

)?
???+1 =

??
??1 (?1)??2 (?1 ? ?)??1,

where ??1 is a cdf of a Normal distribution with mean 0 and variance ?
*2
? , the function ??2

is a pdf of a Normal distribution with mean 0 and variance ?2? , and ? = ?? +?(?
?
? )??(??? ).

Integrating by parts, we can rewrite it as

?(?) =

??
??1 (?1) [1 ? ??2 (?1 ? ?)] ??1.

Differentiating it with respect to ??, we find ?
?(?) =

??
??1 (?1)??2 (?1 ? ?)??1, a con-

volution of two normal density function. Therefore, we know that ??(?) will be a pdf of



33

a Normal distribution with mean zero and variance given by the sum of both variances,

and hence

?
(?
?? + ?(?

?
? ) ? ?(?

?
? )
)?

= ?

(?
?? + ?(?

?
? ) ? ?(??? )??

?2? [?
?
? + ?

?
? + ? (? ? ? ? 1)] + ?2? [2? ? ??? ? ??? + ? (? ? ? ? 1)]

)?
.

Now we can compute the Nash equilibrium for the period ? using our guess, where

players solve the following problems

max
???

??

(?
?? + ?(?

?
? ) ? ?(??? )??

?2? [?
?

?2? [?
?
? + ?

?
? + ? (? ? ? ? 1)] + ?2? [2? ? ??? ? ??? + ? (? ? ? ? 1)]

)?]?
.

The solution of these problem can be found by the same way we use in the Propo-

sition 1, and thus must satisfies the following conditions

??(??? ) =
?2? ? ?2?

2

??
(? ? ?) ?(?2? + ?2? )

and ??(??? ) = ??
?(??? ), (1.20)

where again we have ?(??? ) = ?(?
?
? ) and ?

?
? + ?

?
? = ?. Finally, using these conditions, we

can check that our guess (1.19) for the value function is indeed the correct value function:

? ?? (??) = ??

(?
????

(?2? + ?
2
? ) ?(? ? ?)

)?
and ? ?? (??) = ?

[?
1 ? ?

(?
????

(?2? + ?
2
? ) ?(? ? ?)

)?]?
.

Thus, by the procedure of guess-and-verify, we found the value function and the strategy

profile for period ?. The sufficient condition for uniqueness can be found by the same way

as in Proposition 1, which concludes the demonstration.

The strategy profile for period ? is similar to the static equilibrium, except that now

it depends on the accumulated output difference up to period ?, and there is a new term,

? ? ? , which is how many periods have left until the end of the game. This term allow
us to formalize the idea about how player behave over a multi-stage tournament.

This idea is formalized in the following corollary.

Corollary 2 Players with (dis)advantage will seek (more) less risk as the game comes to

the end.

Proof. Suppose player ? has some advantage, i.e. ?? &gt; 0. By the implicit differentiation,

we have
????

?(? ? ? + 1)
= ?

?2? ? ?2?
2?2(? ? ?)2(?2? + ?2? )

??
???(??? )

&gt; 0,



34

and
????

?(? ? ?)
=

?2? ? ?2?
2?2(? ? ?)2(?2? + ?2? )

??
???(??? )

&amp;lt;0,

where the inequality signs come from the fact that ?(·) is a strictly concave function.

This corollary shows us how the player behave along the tournament. In words,

given an advantage for player ?, if the tournament is just beginning and it will endure

for a long time, the term on denominator ? ? ? will be higher, reducing the value of
??. The intuition is that, if the tournament will continue for a long time, there will be

higher “uncertainty ” about the outcome at the end of the tournament, and thus trying to

reduce the variance of the period ? outcome won’t have much impact at the final outcome.

Therefore, players prefer to maximize their output on the early stages of the game. As

the game come to the end, the player with advantage will try to secure his position by

reducing the time allocate on the risky activity, as now it will have greater impact on the

final output. On the other hand, the underdog will seek risk.

In order to provide an examples and see how player behave over time in a dynamic

tournament, we made a simulation of a twenty-period tournament which is shown in

Figure 1.7. There are five different realizations of the random variables involved in the

tournament, each represented by different color. Each color is a new tournament starting

from zero. We show three different figures, where the first is the accumulated output

difference, that is, ??, which is the state of the game at the beginning of period ?. When

the lines are above zero, it means player ? is ahead, and player ? is losing. For example,

reading figure 1.7a, the blue line represents a tournament realization. Both players starts

at 0, so there is no advantage at the first period. By the period 5, player ? has 4 units of

output more than player ?. At the end of the tournament, represented by period ? = 21,

we can see who was the winner. The dark blue tournament, player ? won approximately

by 6.8 output units more than player ?. The light blue line, player ? won the tournament

by 10 units more than player ?.

In the Figure 1.7b is depicted how player allocate their time on risk activity. As

it was shown by proposition 1, since players start without any advantage, both players

chose ?/2, and thus maximize their expected output. As the tournament evolves, some

player will obtain some advantage, and they start to deviate from the optimal choice, ?/2.

We can see the proposition 1 working here. Take the dark blue line for example. From

the Figure 1.7a, we know that player ? is always ahead of player ?, so he reduces the

volatility of his output by allocating more time to safe activities, i.e. ???&amp;lt;
?/2.

The Figure 1.7c represents the expected output for player ?. We can see that he

avoids to deviate from the optimal choice ?/2 during most part of the tournament, which

generates an expected output of 1.4142 in this setting.



35

We can also see the proposition 2 working here, using this three figures. Consider the

tournament represented by the light blue line. We can see player ? with a disadvantage

equal to 10 in 5 different moments (? ? 7,8,15,18,20). In Figure 1.7b we can see player
? time allocation on risky activity. By looking at the periods mentioned above, we can

see that as the tournament nears the end, he seeks more risk, although he has the same

disadvantage at those moments. By the end of the game, he allocates more than 90% of

his time on the risky activity. Figure 1.7c shows that players avoid distortions on expected

output during most part of the tournament.

1.5 Other Extensions for the Static Tournament

In this section we discuss some possible modifications and extensions on the static version

of the model presented in Section 1.3.1, and see how it affects players behavior.



36

1.5.1 Asymmetric expected output

We shall discuss the implications of the symmetry of the expected output function ?(·) and
what would happen if we relax this assumption. The symmetry of the expected output

function helped us to find a closed-form solution for both the static and, especially, the

dynamic tournament. The symmetry implies that the function ? is even with respect to

?/2, i.e. ?(?) = ?(? ? ?), and so the inclination of ? for two different points equidistant
to ?/2 has the same magnitude but with different sign, i.e. ??(?) = ??(? ? ?). Therefore,
the equilibrium condition that ??(??) = ???(??) implies that ?(??) = ?(??). Another
implication that follows from the function ? is even with respect to ?/2 is that we can

write ??(?) = ???(? ? ?), and using the assumption that ? is a concave function, then ??

will be monotone, and so the equilibrium condition implies that ?? = ? ? ??. By doing
it, we were able to find a closed form for the variance ?2 and solve the players’ problem.

We can relax this assumption by considering that each activity has a different ex-

pected output, say ??(·) and ??(·). Now, for each ?? unit time spent on task ? by player
?, the output generated by it follows a Normal distribution, i.e. ? ?? ? ?(??(??),???

2
?).

Denote now the expected total output by player ? as ?(???) = ??(?
?
?) + ??(? ? ???).

The first order condition would be similar to the Equation (1.3), but now considering

two different function for the expected output,

? ??(?
?) ? ? ??(? ? ?

?) =
?2? ? ?2?

2?
? and ? ??(?

?) ? ? ??(? ? ?
?) = ?

?2? ? ?2?
2?

?, (1.21)

and again the condition for the equilibrium is

??(??) =
?2? ? ?2?

2?
? = ???(??).

However, since the expected output functions are not symmetric, we cannot find a closed-

form solution to the problem as before, and thus we would not be able to use the guess-

and-verify method to find the equilibrium in the dynamic model. The Figure 1.8 below

illustrates a situation in which ? ??/?
?
? is an increasing function of ?, that is, the marginal

rate of technical substitution is increasing. So, in order to maintain the same level of

expected output, reducing one unit of time allocated to risky activity, a player needs

to increase in less than one unit of time allocated to the safe activity. We illustrate

numerically the case where ?1 &gt; 0, that is, player ? has an advantage. In this situation,

it becomes harder to determine analytically the signal of ?, that is, if ?1 + ?(?
?) ? ?(??)

is positive or negative.

1.5.2 Tie-Break Rule

Now, we consider the static model presented in section 1.3.1 again, but we will introduce

a tie-break rule, in the sense that, if the output of a player are not sufficiently greater than

his opponent’ output, the principal will declare a tie. The motivation of this section is to

provide further insights about tournaments when the precision of the measure to decide

who will be the winner is not good enough. For example, in the swimming competition

and car racing, it is possible to determine the winner no matter how close they are, using

precision timing of milliseconds. However, in the fund industry, a small difference over

performance may not be enough for a fund receive more deposits than the other one.

Maybe the investor prefer to move their money to other funds only if they are sufficiently

better than the one where the money is deposited due to transaction costs.

In order to do that, let us introduce the tie-break as ? &gt; 0 and now we will need

three prizes. To ease the computation, we will consider a symmetric prizes: ?,0 and ??,
that is, the winner receives ? , if there is a tie both players receive nothing, and the loser

must pay ?. So, for example, player ? wins the tournament, if his output overcomes

player ? output plus ?, i.e. ? ? &gt; ? ? + ?. This setting could be thought as the case of

investment funds inflow. The winner fund is the one with sufficiently higher performance

and will receive an inflow of ? deposit, while the loser will notice an outflow of ? from

their deposits. However, if the performance of one fund was not sufficiently better, there

will be no transfers.

The problem player ? faces now is

Figure 1.9 shows how player ? behaves, when he has 1 unit of output in advantage



39

with respect to player ?. The vertical axis, on the right side is how player ? spends

his time on the risky activity, and is represented by the red line. On the other side, it

shows the expected output generated by this player, and it is plotted as a blue line. The

horizontal axis contains all tie-break rules considered for this example, that goes from

zero up to 10.

Figure 1.9: Player ? Choice of Expected Output and Volatility.

In this Figure we can see that when the principal sets the tie-break rule equals

to 2, player ? will choose the maximal expected output, but for greater tie-break rule,

he becomes the underdog and will seek more risk, even though he has started with an

advantage.

Figure 1.10: Player ? Choice of Expected Output and Volatility.

Figure 1.10 shows the same plot, but for player ?. We can see that the tie-break



40

rule also induce the maximal expected output when it is equal to 2. In this case, and for

values larger than it, this player start acting as the leader, and reduces its risk.

1.6 Conclusion

Tournaments are a pervasive circumstance, as they serve as an important tool for providing

incentives. Most work on tournament theory has used the labor economics predominantly

as its background. However, it is quite general, since we can apply it for investment funds,

research and development, elections and political campaigns, students’ competition for

better recommendation letter and so on.

The initial literature showed that tournaments can be a good instrument for encour-

aging the optimal effort level under a situation where players are subject to a common

risk, affecting the output of all contestants. However, in a dynamic setting, players can

deviate from what is the best choice from the principal point of view in order to increase

their chance of winning the prize, due to the asymmetric position they will almost surely

be. It also can induce risk-seeking behavior by the player in disadvantage, since overcom-

ing his opponent becomes harder through the effort, and volatility will be more likely the

way to increase his chance of winning the prize.

This paper has studied how players behave in a tournament towards the risk taking

in a static and dynamic setting. Our environment considered different tasks that a player

can work on, and each of them is associated with different risk levels. The standard

model in the tournament literature involves no trade-off between the expected output

and variance, and the choice of risk does not involve any cost. However, in order to take

more risk, sometimes agents need to give up some expected return. The trade-off between

expected output and variance allowed us to find an interior solution for the problem, while

in most of the literature that do not consider a direct cost over the variance choice end up

with extreme variance choices. In order to deal with it, most of the studies allow players

to choose between two possible values, that is high risk and low risk. The problem is

that in a dynamic setting, the equilibrium in the two-stage model increases the difficult

of find a unique solution for the game. In our setting, the simultaneous choice of risk

and expected return allow us to consider the dynamic problem in a more tractable way.

We were able to find the Markov perfect equilibrium for the dynamic tournament, and

thus formalizing the common wisdom that contestant seeks more risk by the end of the

tournament.

Nonetheless, many questions kept unanswered, and should be a matter of concern for

the development of this research. We assumed that activities have a symmetric expected

output, since it can easily characterize the equilibrium. However, we might lose some



41

interesting properties from the equilibrium by doing this assumption. It could be possible

to understand better, how player perceive the trade-off between the mean and variance, by

relaxing the symmetry assumption. In addition, a growing part of literature are concerned

about the optimal design of the prizes and the property of convexity of it, so it could be a

future extension for this model to compute the optimal prize. Another extension could be

to study what happen when more players are in the game. Finally, it would be interesting

to test empirically the risk behavior the players have along a tournament.

Unitizac?a?o de Jazidas de Petro?leo:

Uma Aplicac?a?o do Modelo de Green

e Porter

Abstract

Neste trabalho abordamos a unitizac?a?o como uma reinterpretac?a?o de cartel,

partindo do modelo cla?ssico de Green e Porter. A incerteza geolo?gica e? represen-

tada por um componente estoca?stico no custo marginal. Caracterizamos o contrato

o?timo e, a partir da esta?tica comparativa, avaliamos a eficie?ncia e a viabilidade da

cooperac?a?o. O prec?o e o grau da externalidade afetam positivamente o n??vel de

eficie?ncia do contrato o?timo. Mas enquanto prec?os elevados viabilizam os acordos,

o grau de externalidade elevado pode conduzir a equil??brios ineficientes ou mesmo

inviabilizar a produc?a?o. O mesmo resultado ocorre com os custos fixos. Adicional-

mente, quanto maior for o nu?mero de firmas envolvidas no acordo, menor sera? a

chance de existir um contrato mais eficiente que a regra da captura.

2.1 Introduc?a?o

Um setor de petro?leo descentralizado cria condic?a?o para um problema potencial inerente

aos recursos de propriedade comum, a trage?dia dos comuns. Este problema surge quando

duas ou mais firmas te?m direito de explorac?a?o um mesmo reservato?rio. Devido a? natureza

migrato?ria, a extrac?a?o de uma firma ira? afetar a produc?a?o e o custo das outras firmas.

Caso na?o haja algum tipo de esforc?o para cooperac?a?o, o resultado sera? a explorac?a?o em

n??veis elevados. O custo da extrac?a?o sera? demasiadamente elevado e o retorno da produc?a?o

do reservato?rio reduzira?. Logo o resultado da competic?a?o sera? a ineficie?ncia.

Para evitar a perda associada a? extrac?a?o competitiva, as firmas podem tentar coop-



44

erar, definindo consensualmente um plano de produc?a?o o?timo. A unitizac?a?o e? um acordo

de cooperac?a?o para a extrac?a?o conjunta, de forma mais racional do reservato?rio. Pore?m,

a incerteza geolo?gica dificulta a negociac?a?o destes acordos, pois ela induz a? assimetria

de informac?a?o entre as firmas. Alguns trabalhos emp??ricos, como Libecap and Wiggins

(1985), reportam que nem sempre estes acordos sa?o conclu??dos com sucesso. Diante deste

problema, a questa?o que surge naturalmente e?: como o ambiente influencia a viabilidade

de contratos que possam reduzir a ineficie?ncia da competic?a?o sob a regra da captura.

Neste trabalho foi abordada a cooperac?a?o, como uma reinterpretac?a?o de cartel, pois

as firmas te?m incentivo natural a aumentar a produc?a?o, em detrimento da reduc?a?o do

lucro da indu?stria. O acordo de cartel deve ser escrito de forma que cada uma das firmas

envolvidas aceite o acordo de forma descentralizada. Partindo do modelo cla?ssico de Green

e Porter, o contrato o?timo e? caracterizado e a esta?tica comparativa traz algumas respostas

para a questa?o. Tanto o prec?o quanto o grau da externalidade afetam positivamente o n??vel

de eficie?ncia poss??vel do contrato o?timo. Pore?m, enquanto o aumento nos prec?os viabiliza

acordos de cooperac?a?o, elevado grau de externalidade podem conduzir a indu?stria para

equil??brios ineficientes ou mesmo inviabilizar a produc?a?o. O mesmo ocorre quando os

custos fixos sa?o elevados, de forma que e? o?timo na?o produzir. Adicionalmente, quanto

maior for o nu?mero de firmas envolvidas no acordo, menor sera? a chance de existir um

contrato mais eficiente que a regra da captura.

Este trabalho esta? dividido em duas sec?o?es. Na sec?a?o 2.2 apresentamos o problema

que a indu?stria de hidrocarboneto esta? submetida. Em seguida, e? destacada a unitizac?a?o

como uma alternativa para evitar ineficie?ncia na produc?a?o. Alguns resultados emp??ricos

e teo?ricos sobre a viabilidade dos acordos de unitizac?a?o sa?o citados. Ao final da sec?a?o e?

apresentado o modelo de Green e Porter, o qual foi usado como base para este modelo. Na

sec?a?o 2.3 e? apresentado o modelo formalmente e os resultados obtidos, como a caracteri-

zac?a?o do contrato o?timo e a esta?tica comparativa para avaliar a eficie?ncia e a viabilidade

do contrato. Ao final do trabalho, na sec?a?o 2.4, comparamos os resultados obtidos com

os modelos iniciais de unitizac?a?o.

2.2 O problema dos recursos comuns e a unitizac?a?o

A indu?stria de hidrocarbonetos exibe as caracter??sticas cla?ssicas de recursos de propriedade

comum. A dificuldade de mapear os reservato?rios antes do processo de licitac?a?o cria

condic?o?es para que blocos cont??guos estejam delimitados sobre uma mesma reserva. Neste

caso, as firmas podem se valer da regra da captura para decidir o n??vel de produc?a?o. Se-

gundo esta regra, a propriedade do petro?leo e? concedida a firma que extraiu o recurso;

pore?m, devido a? natureza migrato?ria do hidrocarboneto, esta regra provoca uma extrac?a?o

predato?ria das reservas, elevando os custos da produc?a?o. Em particular, a extrac?a?o exager-



45

ada reduzira? demasiadamente a pressa?o interna do reservato?rio, podendo comprometer o

fator de recuperac?a?o do reservato?rio com uma pol??tica predato?ria de produc?a?o. A? me-

dida que a pressa?o se reduz, sa?o necessa?rios me?todos mais custosos para a extrac?a?o do

hidrocarboneto. Assim, todas as firmas que produzem sobre um mesmo reservato?rio esta?o

sujeitas a esta externalidade.

Uma alternativa para minimizar os efeitos da explorac?a?o exagerada e? o acordo de

unitizac?a?o. Basicamente, este acordo e? celebrado entre firmas com o objetivo da produc?a?o

conjunta do reservato?rio. A coordenac?a?o permite que a produc?a?o seja feita de forma mais

eficiente, se aproximando do n??vel de produc?a?o de monopo?lio. Uma forma de interpretar

este acordo e? como a formac?a?o de um cartel. Neste caso, o cartel permite alcanc?ar resulta-

dos mais eficientes em relac?a?o a? regra da captura, pois o acordo estabelecera? um n??vel de

produc?a?o do que considera a presenc?a da externalidade. Os ganhos de um acordo de coop-

erac?a?o sa?o retratados por alguns autores, como Libecap and Wiggins (1984) apresentam

dados do Federal Oil Conservation Board de 1926, que estima que a taxa de recuperac?a?o

de petro?leo sob competic?a?o e? de apenas 20 a 25%, enquanto a taxa de recuperac?a?o quando

apenas uma firma operasse poderia alcanc?ar 85 a 90%. Ja? Libecap and Wiggins (1985)

apresentam estimativas ainda mais otimistas, a partir da publicac?a?o Oil Weekly de 1942,

no qual a recuperac?a?o em a?reas unitizadas poderia aumentar a produc?a?o em duas a cinco

vezes.

Apesar existir ganhos potenciais ao cooperar, a experie?ncia americana demonstrou

que ha? dificuldades para conclusa?o destes acordos quando na?o ha? intervenc?a?o do gov-

erno. Gary Libecap e co-autores escreveram trabalhos nos anos 1980 e 1990, explorando

empiricamente esta dificuldade.1 Wiggins and Libecap (1985) afirmam que as principais

dificuldades para conclusa?o dos acordos esta? relacionado com a assimetria de informac?a?o

e incerteza geolo?gica. Segundo os autores, a unitizac?a?o pode atrasar ou na?o ocorrer em

func?a?o da diverge?ncia sobre as estimativas do valor da jazida, ou seja, a incerteza esta?

induzindo a assimetria de informac?a?o.2 Outro motivo para atrasar uma unitizac?a?o pode

ser estrate?gico. Quando uma firma na?o entra na unitizac?a?o, gerara? perdas agregadas

que afeta as firmas que participam da unitizac?a?o. Isto dara? maior poder de barganha

para as firmas que na?o participam da unitizac?a?o, aumentando a partilha recebida por ela.

Contudo, ha? poucos trabalhos teo?ricos abordando este tema e como o ambiente afeta a

viabilidade de um acordo de cooperac?a?o.

A unitizac?a?o de jazidas de petro?leo pode ser uma reinterpretac?a?o dos acordos para

cartelizac?a?o. No caso do cartel, cada firma tem incentivo a produzir acima no n??vel

1Ver Libecap and Smith (1999), Libecap and Wiggins (1985) e Wiggins and Libecap (1985). Para
uma revisa?o um pouco mais ampla, ver Kim and Mahoney (2002).

especialistas, mesmo que estejam usando os mesmos dados.

de produc?a?o que maximiza o lucro da indu?stria, pois assim teria maior participac?a?o no

mercado e na receita. Deste modo, as firmas na?o esta?o internalizando que a produc?a?o

exagerada reduzira? o prec?o de mercado. Analogamente, temos este resultado para o caso

dos recursos de propriedade comum, como mostra a trage?dia dos comuns. A unitizac?a?o

neste caso e? representada pela formac?a?o de um cartel; ou seja, de uma u?nica empresa

para internalizar o custo da externalidade. Neste caso, o prec?o pode ser considerado fixo,

mas a externalidade e? representada no custo de extrac?a?o do recurso, afetando assim o

valor presente do lucro esperado. Desta forma, o n??vel de extrac?a?o do recurso seria Pareto

superior ao n??vel de extrac?a?o de Cournot3.

Partindo da ideia da unitizac?a?o como formac?a?o de cartel, Deilami (1991) e? um dos

primeiros trabalhos teo?ricos sobre a unitizac?a?o. O autor analisa como o ambiente afeta

a viabilidade de existir um mecanismo descentralizado de cooperac?a?o fact??vel, ou seja,

mecanismos que utilizam apenas o recurso gerado para compensar as firmas na?o produ-

toras. As firmas sa?o heteroge?neas e podem reportar falsamente seus custos marginais de

produc?a?o. Neste modelo, e? considerado o problema de definir o operador e partilhar o

recurso entre as firmas na unitizac?a?o. Os incentivos deste ambiente fazem com que as

firmas de custo elevado prefiram reportar um custo inferior para sinalizar que no caso de

produc?a?o competitiva, elas teriam retorno superior. Enquanto as firmas de custo baixo

preferem reportar um custo superior para barganhar maior participac?a?o na partilha do lu-

cro. No caso da unitizac?a?o na?o ocorrer, as firmas competira?o pelo recurso seguindo a regra

da captura. O autor mostra que os prec?os aumentam o benef??cio da cooperac?a?o, facili-

tando a existe?ncia de acordos. Note que prec?os elevados induzem a receitas maiores, que

por sua vez aumenta o recurso dispon??vel para compensar as firmas na?o produtoras. Este

fator na?o foi considerado pelo Wiggins and Libecap (1985).4 A magnitude da externali-

dade do reservato?rio e os custos fixos tambe?m influenciam positivamente a factibilidade

do acordo, pois neste caso quando duas ou mais firmas produzem competitivamente, o

custo de extrac?a?o aumentara? em func?a?o da externalidade que cada um delas gera para as

demais; e quanto maior os custos fixos, devido a? duplicidade de custos fixos, menor sera?

o lucro gerado pela jazida.

Contudo, os resultados anal??ticos deste modelo dependem do nu?mero de firmas ser

grande o suficiente. Note que quando o nu?mero de firmas e? grande, o benef??cio de uma

unitizac?a?o sera? maior e mais prova?vel neste modelo, pois maior sera? a economia gerada por

na?o competir com custos fixos e externalidade. Esta hipo?tese na?o e? uma boa aproximac?a?o

da realidade, pois quanto maior o nu?mero de firmas envolvidas num acordo, mais dif??cil

sera? a conclusa?o dele. Mailath and Postlewaite (1990) apresentam um modelo de barganha

3Neste trabalho, a alocac?a?o de Cournot se refere a? extrac?a?o quando as firmas na?o fazem acordo para
cooperar.

4Os dados utilizados por Wiggins and Libecap (1985) eram da de?cada de 1960. Os prec?os se elevaram
apo?s os dois choque de petro?leo da de?cada de 1970.

com assimetria de informac?a?o, no qual mesmo que haja ganhos sociais de um acordo

ser conclu??do, quando o nu?mero de agentes aumenta se torna dif??cil de chegar a um

acordo. Adicionalmente, o ambiente considerado por Deilami (1991) e? esta?tico e na?o ha?

incerteza sobre o reservato?rio. Ao considerar interac?o?es repetidas podem surgir incentivos

distintos dos incentivos dos jogos esta?ticos. Interac?o?es repetidas permitem aos jogadores

estabelecerem formas de punic?a?o no caso de deserc?a?o da cooperac?a?o. Green and Porter

(1984) e Porter (1983b) desenvolveram um modelo cla?ssico que estuda uma indu?stria que

enfrenta o problema de detectar e impedir desvios do n??vel de produc?a?o do acordo de

cartel. Porter (1983a) observou que ocorriam episo?dios recorrentes de alterac?o?es no prec?o

e lucro da indu?stria e tais alterac?o?es eram estatisticamente significativas. No modelo de

Porter (1983b), a indu?stria incorre em custos para coletar e disseminar dados de prec?os e

quantidades entre os membros, bem como custos para verificar a acuidade da informac?a?o.

Desta forma, as firmas observam apenas sua pro?pria produc?a?o e o prec?o5 de mercado,

mas na?o observam a quantidade produzida por cada uma das outras firmas. O autor

considera um jogo de Cournot repetido infinitamente e representa esta incerteza usando

um componente estoca?stico na curva de demanda. Desta forma, uma queda inesperada

nos prec?os pode sinalizar tanto um desvio da produc?a?o do cartel como um choque negativo

sobre a demanda.

No ambiente considerado por Green e Porter, as firmas podem evitar desvios do

n??vel de produc?a?o de cooperac?a?o usando uma estrate?gia de gatilho. Quando o prec?o de

mercado fica abaixo do prec?o gatilho, as firmas produzira?o no n??vel de Cournot por um

tempo fixado previamente, denominado de per??odo de punic?a?o. Uma firma que considere

expandir sua produc?a?o secretamente, deve ponderar o trade-off entre o ganho imediato de

lucro com a elevac?a?o da probabilidade dos prec?os de mercado ficarem abaixo do gatilho de

prec?os. Isto aumentara? a chance de haver lucros inferiores nos per??odos seguintes, uma vez

que a indu?stria reverte o n??vel de produc?a?o para o equil??brio de Cournot. Green and Porter

(1984) mostram que, mesmo no equil??brio na?o cooperativo, havera? episo?dios recorrentes

de “Guerra de Prec?os”, ou seja, per??odos que a indu?stria produz competitivamente. Estes

episo?dios sa?o causados pelo choque negativo sobre a demanda, mas nunca por um desvio

volunta?rio de alguma firma.

Na pro?xima sec?a?o sera? apresentada formalmente esta uma modificac?a?o do modelo

de Porter (1983b) para aplica?-lo ao caso da unitizac?a?o. A motivac?a?o desta modificac?a?o

consiste em avaliar a eficie?ncia e a viabilidade da cooperac?a?o entre as firmas quando na?o ha?

regulac?a?o. Para isto, e? caracterizado o equil??brio o?timo e a partir da esta?tica comparativa

sera? avaliado como o prec?o, a incerteza e o grau de externalidade afetam a possibilidade

de haver cooperac?a?o.

5Por hipo?tese, a produc?a?o das firmas e? homoge?nea, logo o prec?o de mercado e? o mesmo para todas as
firmas.

2.3 Aplicac?a?o do Modelo de Green e Porter

Considere um jogo dina?mico em tempo discreto, no qual ? ? N firmas possuem direito
de extrac?a?o de uma mesma jazida. A cada per??odo ? &gt; 0, cada firma ? escolhe o n??vel de

extrac?a?o6 ??? &gt; 0 simultaneamente. Denote ?? = (?1?,...,???) o vetor de extrac?a?o no per??odo

? e a extrac?a?o total por ?? =
???

?=1 ???. A extrac?a?o das firmas e? de qualidade homoge?nea

e o prec?o de mercado e? constante, dado por ?. Suponha que as firmas possuem a mesma

tecnologia de extrac?a?o. Logo, o custo marginal de extrac?a?o ex post e? comum entre as

firmas. Suponha que o custo marginal de extrac?a?o tem um componente estoca?stico, de

forma que as firmas observam somente ??, dado por

?? = ????? (??) ,

onde {??} e? uma seque?ncia de varia?veis aleato?rias i.i.d., na?o observadas diretamente pelas
firmas, com me?dia ?, func?a?o de densidade ? e distribuic?a?o ?. O componente estoca?stico

do custo marginal representa a incerteza geolo?gica que as firmas esta?o sujeitas. Mais

precisamente este componente altera o grau de externalidade do reservato?rio. Suponha

que ?(0) = 0 e que ?(?) = 1, e que tanto ? como ? sa?o continuamente diferencia?veis.
Adicionalmente, ??? : R+ ? R+ e? dada por

??? (??) = ? + ???. (2.1)

Observe que o termo ??? representa a externalidade da extrac?a?o no custo marginal

???, onde ? &gt; 0 e? o coeficiente de externalidade. O custo total da firma ? e? dado por

? (???,??) = ????? (??) ??? + ?, (2.2)

onde ? e? o custo fixo comum de cada firma. Podemos escrever a func?a?o lucro esperado7

da firma ? de um per??odo como

?? (?) ? ? (??,??) = [? ? ? (?? + ??)] ?? ? ?, (2.3)

onde ?? = ? ? ?? =
??

? ?=? ?? e? a soma da extrac?a?o das outras firmas, ? = ? ? ?? e
? = ??. Suponha que 0 &amp;lt;?? &amp;lt;?, e que ? &gt; 0, logo ? e ? sa?o constantes positivas. No

ambiente dina?mico, cada firma ? escolhe um plano de produc?a?o {???}??=0 que maximiza o
lucro esperado em valor presente, com fator de desconto comum ? ? (0,1), i.e.

Antes de avaliarmos o jogo dina?mico sera? apresentado o equil??brio do jogo esta?tico,

os quais sera?o benchmarks para avaliar a eficie?ncia da estrate?gia no caso dina?mico. O

equil??brio de Cournot do stage game sera? representado por ? = (??)

No caso de um monopo?lio produzindo com ? plantas ide?nticas, onde cada planta

contribui com 1/? da produc?a?o, seria equivalente ao caso de um cartel perfeito. Assim,

cada firma extraira? o recurso a? um n??vel que maximize o retorno esperado da indu?stria.

Denote o vetor de extrac?a?o de monopo?lio como ? = (??)

E? poss??vel mostrar que a alocac?a?o eficiente deste modelo sera? dada pelo n??vel de

produc?a?o ?. Note que a demanda e? totalmente ela?stica, de modo que o excedente de

um consumidor e? nulo. Assim, a alocac?a?o que maximiza o bem-estar da economia sera?

equivalente a? soluc?a?o de monopo?lio. Neste modelo tambe?m ocorre a trage?dia dos comuns;

ou seja, o n??vel de extrac?a?o no equil??brio de Cournot e? superior ao n??vel de extrac?a?o

8Usando a equac?a?o (2.5).
9Ao longo do trabalho, o n??vel de produc?a?o de monopo?lio se refere a extrac?a?o igual a ? de cada uma

das plantas.

eficiente, i.e., ? &gt; ?, o que implica que o custo esperado de equil??brio sera? superior ao n??vel

eficiente. O lucro esperado no equil??brio de Cournot sera? estritamente inferior ao lucro

esperado da alocac?a?o eficiente. Da mesma forma como ocorre no dilema dos prisioneiros,

o aumento da extrac?a?o unilateral implica retorno superior para firma ? em relac?a?o ao n??vel

de extrac?a?o da unitizac?a?o.

No restante do trabalho, verificamos que e? poss??vel encontrar um acordo com n??vel de

produc?a?o Pareto superior a? produc?a?o do equil??brio de Cournot quando as firmas seguem a

estrate?gia de Green e Porter. Neste ambiente, na?o existe um regulador e os acordos devem

ser implementados a partir de um equil??brio de Nash. Ou seja, mesmo atuando de forma

competitiva, as firmas ira?o preferir fazer parte do acordo de unitizac?a?o para auferir lucros

superiores, e na?o ira?o desviar do acordo. No caso de desvio, a probabilidade de incorrer

em punic?a?o sera? maior. Logo o lucro esperado do desvio sera? inferior ao da unitizac?a?o.

Considere a estrate?gia na qual as firmas inicialmente extraem no n??vel determinado pelo

acordo, e mante?m este n??vel de extrac?a?o ate? que o custo marginal observado ultrapasse

um gatilho de custo ?, previamente determinado. Quando o custo marginal exceder o

gatilho, as firmas produzira?o no n??vel de Cournot por ? ? 1 per??odos (episo?dios rever-
siona?rios), independentemente do que acontec?a com o custo marginal nestes per??odos. A

partir do per??odo ? apo?s o acionamento do gatilho, as firmas voltara?o a produzir no n??vel

determinado pelo acordo. O per??odo de punic?a?o desta estrate?gia equivale ao caso em

que voltam a competir de acordo com a regra da captura, produzindo exageradamente e

com custos elevados. Os per??odos cooperativos e na?o cooperativos podem ser definidos

recursivamente por

(a) ? = 0 e? um per??odo cooperativo;

(b) se ? e? um per??odo cooperativo e ?? 6 ?, enta?o ? + 1 e? um per??odo cooperativo;

(c) se ? e? um per??odo cooperativo e ?? &gt; ?, enta?o ? + 1, ..., ? + ? ? 1 sa?o per??odos na?o
cooperativos, com n??vel de produc?a?o ?? = ?, e ? + ? e? um per??odo cooperativo.

Note que na?o ha? desvio lucrativo do n??vel de extrac?a?o de Cournot para uma firma,

quando todas as outras esta?o produzindo no n??vel de Cournot. Desta forma, a estrate?gia

que as firmas ira?o seguir e? definida por10

??? =

Uma hipo?tese impl??cita do modelo se refere a? estacionaridade do problema dina?mico.

10Na subsec?a?o 2.3.1 sera? mostrado que, em geral, na?o e? poss??vel alcanc?ar a produc?a?o de monopo?lio ?
nos per??odos cooperativos.



51

Cada firma esta? sujeita a? um processo de Markov estaciona?rio de dois estados (cooperativo

e na?o cooperativo) com T per??odos.11 Portanto, quando as firmas seguem esta estrate?gia,

a func?a?o valor esperado descontado da produc?a?o satisfaz uma relac?a?o recursiva. Enta?o,

dado que as firmas ira?o produzir ao n??vel ? predeterminado no acordo, o valor esperado

descontado para a firma ? e? definido por

?? (?) = ?? (?) + Pr [?? 6 ?] ??? (?) + Pr [?? &gt; ?]

[?
??1??
?=1

???? (?) + ?
??? (?)

]?
. (2.7)

Ou seja, o valor e? dado pelo lucro do per??odo presente somado ao valor esperado

do pro?ximo per??odo. Caso o custo marginal observado seja inferior ao custo de gatilho,

o valor do pro?ximo per??odo sera? o valor do per??odo presente descontado por ?. Caso

contra?rio, as firmas recebera?o o lucro de Cournot por ? ? 1 per??odos e enta?o voltam a
cooperar. Podemos reescrever a equac?a?o (2.7) como

?? (?) =

Portanto, o valor para a firma ? e? o lucro esperado descontado de Cournot somado ao

adicional de lucro dos per??odos de cooperac?a?o relativo ao lucro de Cournot, descontado de

forma apropriada. Note que o fator de desconto do lucro adicional em relac?a?o ao lucro de

Cournot e? um fator de desconto esperado, dado por (1 ? ?) ?? + ??, onde o argumento

sentido de Pareto.

Como sera? mostrado adiante, ? na?o sera? uma alocac?a?o de equil??brio. Analogamente

ao ambiente de Porter (1983b), o problema deste modelo na?o e? de existe?ncia de equil??brio,

mas caracterizar o equil??brio que e? Pareto superior em relac?a?o aos demais. A proposic?a?o

3 a seguir mostra que a produc?a?o de Cournot e? sempre um equil??brio, para qualquer par

(?,?) dado.

Proposition 3 Para qualquer func?a?o lucro estritamente co?ncava, o vetor de produc?a?o ?

de equil??brio de Cournot do jogo esta?tico, e? um n??vel de produc?a?o de equil??brio nos per??odos

cooperativos, para quaisquer valores de ? e ? .

Proof. Para verificar que ? e? uma alocac?a?o de equil??brio, note que lado direito de (2.9)

e? trivialmente nulo. E? fa?cil verificar que ??? (?) = 0. Portanto ? satisfaz a condic?a?o de

nos per??odos cooperativos.

Podemos restringir o conjunto das alocac?o?es poss??veis de equil??brio. Como o lu-

cro das firmas e? sime?trico, a extrac?a?o de equil??brio sera? igual para todas as firmas, i.e.

??? = ?
?
? ? ?

? para todo ?,? = 1,...,?. Desta forma evitaremos o problema de conciliar

interesses distintos, e permite avaliar como a incerteza atua sobre a soluc?a?o de equil??brio.

Adicionalmente, a proposic?a?o 4 restringe o conjunto dos n??veis de produc?a?o de equil??brio

poss??veis, de modo que ?? ? (?/?,?].

Proposition 4 Em qualquer equil??brio de Nash (??,?,?), todas as firmas produzem no

Como o n??vel de extrac?a?o de Cournot e? um equil??brio, podemos restringir a atenc?a?o

para os valores de ?? no qual as firmas na?o ficam pior do que extrair no n??vel ?. Note que

pela equac?a?o (2.8), ?? (?) &gt; ?? (?) vale se e somente se ?? (?) &gt; ?? (?), ou ainda,

que e? satisfeita se e somente se ? ? [?/?,?]. Pore?m, ?/? na?o satisfaz a condic?a?o de primeira
ordem (2.9), pois ??? (?/?) = ?(? ? 1)/? &gt; 0 enquanto ?? (?/?) ? ?? (?) = 0.

Assim, ?/? na?o e? uma alocac?a?o de equil??brio. Portanto, em qualquer equil??brio

devemos ter que ?? ? (?/?,?].

Vimos pela proposic?a?o 3 que a func?a?o valor ?? (?) e? co?ncava em ?? quando e? avali-

ada no ponto ? para qualquer par (?,?), desde que a func?a?o lucro esperado seja co?ncava.

Pore?m, para garantimos que exista um ma?ximo para a func?a?o valor avaliada nos equi-

l??brios, precisamos restringir o formato da func?a?o de distribuic?a?o ?. A func?a?o valor deve

ser co?ncava em ?? quando todas as outras firmas esta?o no equil??brio de Nash. Como todas

as firmas agem igualmente, a extrac?a?o que maximiza o valor de uma firma, e? o mesmo

valor que ira? maximizar o valor do recurso comum.

Uma condic?a?o suficiente para concavidade da func?a?o valor e? apresentada pela proposic?a?o

5 a seguir. A restric?a?o sobre a elasticidade da func?a?o de distribuic?a?o ? implica que esta

func?a?o e? estritamente co?ncava sobre o suporte.12

Um resultado importante de Green and Porter (1984) deve ser observado. A estru-

tura de incentivos do contrato — a estrate?gia de punic?a?o do Green e Porter —, garante

que as firmas na?o desviem do n??vel de extrac?a?o ?? nos per??odos cooperativos. Portanto,

o custo ira? exceder o gatilho apenas nas realizac?o?es suficientemente altas do componente

estoca?stico ?, e nunca por desvios unilaterais. Da mesma forma, na?o e? racional desviar

do n??vel de extrac?a?o de Cournot nos per??odos de reversa?o. Observe que realizac?o?es altas

de ? implica elevados custos de externalidade. Sendo assim, a trage?dia dos comuns sera?

precedida por um per??odo cujo coeficiente de externalidade ex post, ??, e? elevado e na?o

por desvios unilaterais das firmas.

2.3.1 Desenho do contrato o?timo

Nesta subsec?a?o sera? caracterizado o gatilho e o per??odo de punic?a?o o?timo, que induzem

n??veis de produc?a?o mais eficiente em relac?a?o ao n??vel de Cournot. Sera? caracterizado

apenas as soluc?o?es interiores do problema, ou seja, quando ? &gt; 0 e 1 &amp;lt;? &amp;lt;? para
utilizar a condic?a?o necessa?ria de ma?ximo do problema.13 Trataremos ? como uma varia?vel

cont??nua, pois veremos que existe um grau de liberdade na escolha o?tima. Enta?o basta

escolher um valor inteiro superior e pro?ximo a ?.

Uma quantidade de equil??brio de Nash ?? deste modelo representa tambe?m a quan-

tidade de equil??brio na?o cooperativo no espac?o das estrate?gias (?,?,?,?). Desta forma, ??

e? a soluc?a?o da condic?a?o de primeira ordem (2.12), que e? uma func?a?o do gatilho de custos

? e de ?, onde ? ? 1 e? o per??odo de punic?a?o. Consequentemente, a func?a?o valor esperado
da firma ?, no equil??brio e? uma func?a?o do par (?,?), i.e. ?? (?

? (?,?) ; ?,?), para ? = 1,...,?.

Os valores o?timos de ? e do ? , sob o ponto de vista da firma ?, sa?o aqueles que maximizam

?? (?
? (?,?) ; ?,?) sujeito a ? &gt; 0 e do ? &gt; 1. Mas note que a simetria das firmas implica

que maximizando para a firma ?, tambe?m estaremos maximizando para a indu?stria. Mas

o n??vel de produc?a?o que maximiza o lucro da indu?stria e? equivalente ao n??vel que minimiza

a ineficie?ncia da produc?a?o competitiva. Portanto, a escolha o?tima de ? e do ? implicam

13Mais precisamente, as soluc?o?es interiores de ? sa?o tais que ?/??? (?
?) pertenc?am ao suporte da

distribuic?a?o ?.

por ??/??. Esta condic?a?o implica que ?? 6 0, logo a distribuic?a?o ? deve ser co?ncava.15

Como veremos adiante, podemos interpretar ? como uma medida de ru??do sobre o custo

marginal, de forma que quanto menor for |?|, maior sera? a variabilidade do choque sobre
o custo. Na subsec?a?o 2.3.2 apresentamos um exemplo de distribuic?a?o que satisfaz esta

propriedade, conhecida como distribuic?a?o de Pareto. Denote ?? = ??/??, logo podemos

reescrever esta condic?a?o como

na mesma proporc?a?o que ???(??
?), em resposta a mudanc?as nos para?metros ?,?,?,? e ?,

pois ?? = ??/??. Esta condic?a?o sobre ? ressalta a importa?ncia do choque sobre o modelo.

A concavidade da distribuic?a?o implica que as realizac?o?es dos choques sobre o custo devem

A incerteza neste modelo impede que as firmas alcancem a produc?a?o eficiente em

geral, como sera? mostrado na proposic?a?o 8. No caso sem incerteza, e? poss??vel verificar que

usando a produc?a?o de Cournot como punic?a?o, a alocac?a?o eficiente e? alcanc?ada quando o

fator de desconto for suficientemente alto; pore?m, a incerteza sobre a jazida possui um

papel importante na eficie?ncia do modelo, como mostra a proposic?a?o 7. Primeiro, sera?

mostrado que um aumento no nu?mero de firmas pode inviabilizar a cooperac?a?o. E? poss??vel

15Podemos reescrever esta condic?a?o como a diferenc?a da elasticidade de 1 ? ? em relac?a?o a ?? pela

Logo, quando o nu?mero de firmas aumenta, o n??vel de extrac?a?o individual decresce.

Contudo, o n??vel de extrac?a?o agregado aumentara?. Quanto maior o nu?mero de firmas

explorando a jazida, maior sera? a dificuldade de haver um acordo que induza a equi-

l??brios mais eficientes em relac?a?o ao equil??brio de Cournot. Note que quando ? se torna

infinitamente grande, ??,? e ? tendem a zero. Pore?m,

??,

pois para um ? suficientemente grande, ?? sera? maior que ?, logo as firmas ira?o extrair no

n??vel de equil??brio de Cournot ?. Formalmente, temos que o seguinte resultado:

Proposition 6 Se o nu?mero de firmas for grande o suficiente, o n??vel de extrac?a?o o?timo

nos per??odos cooperativos sera? igual ao n??vel de extrac?a?o de equil??brio de Cournot.

Proof. Suponha, sem perda de generalidade, que o custo fixo ? seja nulo.16 Se ? 6 ??,

enta?o temos que ?? 6 ?, onde ?? e? dado implicitamente por

Se ? &gt; ??, enta?o ?? &gt; ?. Mas como as firmas otimizam suas deciso?es, o n??vel de extrac?a?o

escolhido pelas firmas sera? ?, pois ? e? sempre um equil??brio poss??vel e neste caso ??(?) &gt;

??(?

Uma forma alternativa de obter este resultado mostra a importa?ncia da concavidade

da func?a?o de distribuic?a?o ? sobre o n??vel de extrac?a?o de equil??brio o?timo.

16Esta na?o e? uma condic?a?o necessa?ria para este resultado. Caso ? &gt; 0, seria poss??vel encontrar ??? tal
que ?? (?

Proof. Como ?? &amp;lt;0, enta?o ?? &gt; ?/?, satisfazendo a proposic?a?o 4. Se ?? 6 ??, enta?o

?? 6 ?. Quando ?? &gt; ??, temos que ?? &gt; ?. Neste caso ??(?) &gt; ??(?
?), e como ? e? sempre

um equil??brio de Nash, enta?o as firmas produziriam no n??vel de extrac?a?o de Cournot ?. A

equac?a?o (2.18) e? obtida derivando (2.17) em relac?a?o ??, e lim????? ?
? = ? e? trivialmente

obtido a partir da equac?a?o (2.17).

A medida que nu?mero de firmas cresce, menor sera? ??. Desta forma, mais dif??cil sera?

encontrar um acordo tal que ?? &amp;lt;?. Este resultado e? ana?logo a proposic?a?o 6. Quando o

nu?mero de firmas for grande, e? necessa?rio que a distribuic?a?o seja “suficientemente co?ncava”

para suportar um equil??brio mais eficiente que o equil??brio de Cournot.17 Outra forma de

interpretar o resultado, esta? relacionado ao ru??do do componente estoca?stico. No exemplo

da subsec?a?o 2.3.2, fica claro que quando ? na?o for suficientemente negativo, estamos

no caso em que ha? muito ru??do, ou ainda, a varia?ncia da distribuic?a?o e? elevada. Se a

varia?ncia e? elevada, se torna mais dif??cil definir um gatilho, pois o custo ira? variar muito

mesmo que mantenha o n??vel de extrac?a?o constante. Isto dara? espac?o para comportamento

oportun??stico das firmas. A probabilidade das firmas entrarem no per??odo de punic?a?o sera?

alta, logo sera? invia?vel manter um equil??brio Pareto superior ao equil??brio de Cournot.

Podemos considerar este modelo como uma extensa?o do caso determin??stico. Quando

o ru??do do componente estoca?stico for baixo o suficiente retornamos ao caso determin??stico,

e o equil??brio Pareto o?timo e? alcanc?ado. Note que mantendo a me?dia ? constante, quando

?? tende para ??, a massa de densidade de probabilidade se acumula no ponto me?dio
?, de forma que ?? converge para ?. Quando ? = 1, voltamos para o caso sem incerteza,

e teremos que ?? = ???(??
?) = ???(??). Logo e? poss??vel induzir um equil??brio Pareto

o?timo usando a estrate?gia de gatilho de Green e Porter. Quando ? for livre, a medida que

? se torna mais co?ncava, maior sera? a densidade de probabilidade na parte inferior do

suporte. Ou seja, os choques baixos ocorrera?o com maior probabilidade. Tomando uma

distribuic?a?o com suporte (?0,?1), com ?1 &gt; ?0, quando ?
? tende para ??, teremos que no

limite Pr[? = ?0] = 1, ou seja, a externalidade ocorre no menor grau poss??vel e novamente

estamos num caso sem incerteza. Isto pode ser observado no exemplo da subsec?a?o 2.3.2.

Vimos acima os dois casos extremos, quando ha? muito ru??do e o equil??brio sera? de

Cournot e quando a pouco ru??do e e? poss??vel induzir um equil??brio Pareto o?timo. Considere

agora o caso intermedia?rio, quando ?? &gt; ?? &gt; ??, no qual na?o sera? poss??vel alcanc?ar
resultados eficientes. A incerteza sobre a jazida dificulta definir um gatilho que induza as

firmas extra??rem no n??vel ?. A produc?a?o o?tima ?? sera? maior do que ?, pois caso contra?rio

a punic?a?o para induzir ?? &amp;lt;? na?o seria fact??vel, uma vez que o desvio unilateral sera?

lucrativo. Logo o resultado seria o n??vel de extrac?a?o de Cournot. Com ?? &gt; ?, e? poss??vel

encontrar uma punic?a?o, ou mais precisamente, um par (??,??), de modo que a punic?a?o

17De forma mais precisa, e? necessa?rio que ?? seja suficientemente baixo.



58

seja fact??vel. Factibilidade da punic?a?o significa que existe um par (??,??) tal que as firmas

aceitam participar e que preferem respeitar o acordo, pois o retorno do desvio sera? inferior

ao retorno de respeitar o acordo. Temos enta?o o seguinte resultado:

Proposition 8 Suponha que ? e ? foram escolhidos de modo a maximizar o valor es-

perado da explorac?a?o da jazida e a soluc?a?o o?tima e? interior, i.e. ? &gt; 1 e ?/???(??
?)

pertence ao suporte da distribuic?a?o ? . Suponha ainda que ?? &gt; ?? &gt; ??. Enta?o o
n??vel de extrac?a?o o?timo ?? sera? maior do que o n??vel de extrac?a?o de monopo?lio ?, i.e.

?? &gt; ?. Como corola?rio, custo marginal de extrac?a?o sera? maior que no n??vel eficiente, i.e.

???(??
?) &gt; ???(??).

Proof. Basta verificar que, quanto ?? for suficientemente baixo, da equac?a?o (2.17) temos

? + ?? ? (? + 1) ?
?

?
?

? + ?? + 1
&gt; 1,

pois tanto o denominador quanto o numerador sera?o negativos e????
? + ?? ? (? + 1)

?

?

?

?

????
&gt; |? + ?? + 1| .

Vimos que o nu?mero de firmas afeta a viabilidade de acordos de cooperac?a?o. Quanto

maior o nu?mero de firmas, um n??vel de extrac?a?o mais eficiente se torna menos prova?vel.

Adicionalmente, o prec?o ? e o coeficiente esperado da externalidade, ? = ??, tambe?m

influenciam o n??vel o?timo de extrac?a?o. Lembre que ? = ? ? ??, onde ? e? o prec?o e ? e? o
custo marginal individual e que ?? = ?????(??

?). Primeiro note que quanto mais elevado

for prec?o, maior sera? ??, o que torna mais prova?vel haver cooperac?a?o. Ao mesmo tempo,

temos que
???

logo,

2? (? + ?? + 1)
&gt; 0.

Quando o prec?o e? elevado ou a diferenc?a entre o prec?o e o custo marginal individual

for elevado, a receita gerada pela jazida sera? maior. O n??vel de produc?a?o o?timo aumentara?

como tambe?m o n??vel de produc?a?o de monopo?lio. Mas a taxa de crescimento de ? em

relac?a?o a aumentos marginais de ? ou ? sera? inferior ao aumento de ?? em relac?a?o a

aumentos marginais de ? ou ?. Ou seja, o n??vel de extrac?a?o o?timo aumentara? mais do

que o n??vel de extrac?a?o de monopo?lio, e assim gerando resultados mais ineficientes. A

raza?o disto ocorrer e? que a punic?a?o necessa?ria para manter o n??vel de extrac?a?o pro?ximo

do n??vel de monopo?lio deveria aumentar. Mas aumentando a punic?a?o, seja pelo aumento



59

do per??odo de punic?a?o ou pela reduc?a?o do gatilho, aumentaria a ineficie?ncia da jazida, pois

as firmas extrairiam no n??vel de Cournot com maior probabilidade. Quando se escolhe um

n??vel de produc?a?o mais alto, permite que a punic?a?o seja mais branda, e assim o retorno

esperado da jazida sera? maior.

A externalidade reduz o lucro de desviar do acordo e pode melhorar o n??vel de

produc?a?o do acordo. Note que variac?o?es no coeficiente ? na?o afeta ??, e que

???

??
= ?

??

?
&amp;lt;0

logo,

??

??
= ?????? &amp;lt;0.

Se a externalidade e? alta entre as firmas, o n??vel de extrac?a?o o?timo se aproxima do

n??vel de extrac?a?o de monopo?lio. No caso do monopo?lio havera? apenas aumento de custo,

pois na?o ha? outras firmas explorando a jazida. Assim, a reduc?a?o da produc?a?o na?o precisa

ser ta?o severa. No caso do acordo o?timo, a externalidade reduz o ganho de desviar do

acordo, funcionando como uma punic?a?o. Isto permite punic?o?es mais brandas e que o n??vel

de extrac?a?o se aproxime no n??vel de monopo?lio.

Vale observar que embora o custo fixo ? na?o tenha influe?ncia expl??cita sobre acordo

o?timo, implicitamente afeta todo o modelo. A medida que ? aumenta, sera? necessa?rio

aumentar o n??vel de extrac?a?o da jazida, gerando mais externalidade sobre as firmas. Isto

diminui o intervalo dos n??veis de extrac?a?o Pareto superiores ao equil??brio de Cournot. Se

o custo fixo for excessivamente alto, o u?nico equil??brio trivialmente sera? na?o produzir.

Portanto, a soluc?a?o interior do acordo o?timo e? caracterizada pela seguinte proposic?a?o:

Proposition 9 Seja (??,??) o par da escolha o?tima que maximiza o retorno da jazida,

Ao longo desta subsec?a?o foram examinadas as soluc?o?es interiores do acordo de coop-

erac?a?o o?timo. Contudo, os valores o?timos para ? ou ? ou ambos podem na?o ser interiores.

De acordo com Porter (1983b), e? poss??vel mostrar que ? interior e? uma condic?a?o necessa?ria

para que exista equil??brios sime?tricos mais eficientes em relac?a?o ao n??vel de produc?a?o de

Cournot. Isto significa que, nesta modificac?a?o, o gatilho de custo ? nulo ou infinito im-

plicaria que somente equil??brios de Cournot seriam observados. Note que um gatilho nulo

significa que qualquer n??vel de produc?a?o positivo resultaria em per??odos de punic?a?o, logo

na?o e? poss??vel suportar equil??brios mais eficientes neste caso. Um gatilho infinito significa

que para qualquer n??vel de produc?a?o finita, o gatilho na?o seria atingido. Sendo assim, as

firmas voltam para o caso sem punic?a?o e portanto na?o haveria incentivo para as firmas

cooperarem.

Por fim, Porter (1983b) examina as soluc?o?es interiores para ?. Primeiro note que

? &gt; 1, pois caso ? = 1 significa que as firmas na?o seriam punidas, uma vez que o

per??odo de punic?a?o e? dado por ? ? 1. Logo a soluc?a?o do modelo seria o n??vel de produc?a?o
de Cournot. Desta forma, dentro das soluc?o?es na?o interiores, ?? infinito e ?? = ??/??

pertencer ao suporte de ? sa?o condic?o?es necessa?rias para existirem equil??brios sime?tricos

mais eficientes que o equil??brio Cournot. Isto significa que o cartel deixa de existir a

partir do momento em que o gatilho for excedido e que, de acordo com Porter (1983b), a

expectativa de vida do cartel e? dada por ?(??)?1, func?a?o que depende apenas do nu?mero

de firmas e dos para?metros da distribuic?a?o. Contudo, o autor comenta que algumas

func?o?es de distribuic?a?o na?o suportam equil??brios sime?tricos.

Na subsec?a?o a seguir, apresentamos um exemplo para o caso das soluc?o?es serem

interiores.

2.3.2 Exemplo com a distribuic?a?o de Pareto

Uma distribuic?a?o que satisfaz a propriedade ? + 1 6 0 e? a distribuic?a?o de Pareto. Esta

distribuic?a?o e? caracterizada por dois para?metros: ? &gt; 0 que esta? relacionada com a cur-

vatura da func?a?o distribuic?a?o e ?? que e? a moda da distribuic?a?o. A func?a?o de distribuic?a?o

e? dada por

?(?; ?,??) =

A escolha desta distribuic?a?o decorre da facilidade para resolver o sistema de equac?o?es

da proposic?a?o 9, pois ? e? constante, no suporte da distribuic?a?o:

? =
? ? (?) ?

Neste exemplo podemos reproduzir os resultados obtidos. Note que ?? e? uma func?a?o

. Quando ? tende para o infinito, ?? se aproxima de ?. Note que neste caso Var(?) = 0,

e retornamos para o ambiente sem incerteza. Adicionalmente, quanto menor for ?, maior

o ru??do sobre o modelo, e como conseque?ncia ?? se aproxima de ?. Logo, a elasticidade

da func?a?o de distribuic?a?o ? em relac?a?o a ? tem um papel importante sobre a eficie?ncia

do modelo.

Para ilustrac?a?o, considere o caso em que ? = 5, ? = 1, ? = 1/2, ? = 0, e ? = 3. Os

para?metros da distribuic?a?o sa?o dados por ? = 15 e ?? = 14/15, logo ? = 1. Logo, temos

2.4 Conclusa?o

Este trabalho examinou como o ambiente influencia a viabilidade de um acordo de uni-

tizac?a?o sem a intervenc?a?o governamental. O ganho agregado potencial da cooperac?a?o e?

superior ao retorno da extrac?a?o pela regra da captura. Contudo Wiggins and Libecap

(1985) e Libecap and Wiggins (1985) mostram a dificuldade do contrato ocorrer com

sucesso. Dentre os motivos desta dificuldade, figuram a incerteza geolo?gica e a assimetria

de informac?a?o inerente a? indu?stria de hidrocarbonetos.

A unitizac?a?o pode ser tratada como formac?a?o de um cartel, no qual a cooperac?a?o

das firmas envolvidas pode gerar resultados mais eficientes. Neste sentido, Deilami (1991)



64

desenvolveu um dos primeiros modelos teo?ricos aplicado a unitizac?a?o. Pore?m, este modelo

e? tratado num ambiente esta?tico, que reduz o espac?o dos contratos compat??veis com

incentivo. Quando consideramos um modelo dina?mico temos maior espac?o para incentivar

o conluio usando punic?o?es ao longo do tempo. Esta foi a motivac?a?o desta aplicac?a?o do

modelo de Green e Porter. Um modelo cla?ssico de formac?a?o de cartel, que considera a

incerteza e a assimetria de informac?a?o foi desenvolvido por Porter (1983b). Ele analisa da

viabilidade da cooperac?a?o neste ambiente. Desta forma, a reinterpretac?a?o deste modelo

para o caso da unitizac?a?o e? oportuna.

Este trabalho apresentou a modificac?a?o do modelo de Green e Porter para verificar a

viabilidade de cooperac?a?o na explorac?a?o de recursos de propriedade comum. A incerteza

geolo?gica foi representada por um componente estoca?stico do custo de produc?a?o. O custo

de produc?a?o varia de acordo com a produc?a?o das outras firmas. Neste sentido, a incerteza

geolo?gica esta? representada pelo coeficiente estoca?stico de externalidade do reservato?rio.

Mesmo que o custo seja comum entre as firmas, uma elevac?a?o no custo pode ocorrer

tanto por uma realizac?a?o alta como por um desvio unilateral de alguma firma. Assim, a

incerteza esta? induzindo a? incompletude de informac?a?o entre as firmas.

O acordo o?timo entre as firmas foi caracterizado neste ambiente usando o espac?o

das estrate?gias de Green e Porter. Esta estrate?gia e? definida por um gatilho, representado

pelo custo marginal comum entre as firmas, e por um per??odo de punic?a?o. Quando o custo

exceder um valor predeterminado, iniciara? o per??odo de punic?a?o. Durante este per??odo, as

firmas voltam a competir sob a regra da captura, reduzindo assim o retorno da explorac?a?o.

O contrato o?timo permite que a explorac?a?o do reservato?rio seja feita de forma mais

eficiente do que a regra da captura, representado pelo equil??brio de Cournot. A partir

da esta?tica comparativa, foi avaliado como a incerteza, o nu?mero de firmas, o prec?o e o

coeficiente de externalidade influenciam a viabilidade do acordo e a eficie?ncia da produc?a?o.

A incerteza dificulta a cooperac?a?o entre as firmas, como Wiggins and Libecap (1985)

descrevem. Quanto maior o ru??do sobre o custo, menos informac?a?o uma firma tera? sobre

as demais firmas. Desta forma, estabelecer o gatilho correto se torna invia?vel e o resultado

sera? a competic?a?o pela regra da captura. Pode-se observar o mesmo resultado quando o

nu?mero de firmas e? elevado. O ganho da cooperac?a?o na?o sera? suficientemente alto para

que punic?a?o tenha efica?cia. Este resultado difere de Deilami (1991), que depende de um

grande nu?mero de firmas para obter os resultados anal??ticos.

Prec?os elevados facilitam o acordo entre as firmas, pois o retorno esperado da co-

operac?a?o sera? maior, assim como ocorre em Deilami (1991). Prec?os elevados facilitam o

acordo entre as firmas, pois o retorno esperado da cooperac?a?o sera? maior, assim como

ocorre em Deilami (1991). Pore?m, o n??vel de produc?a?o sera? menos eficiente, uma vez

que aumentos no prec?o elevam o retorno da regra da captura. Para evitar uma punic?a?o



65

severa, que implicaria em aumento na durac?a?o da punic?a?o e menor eficie?ncia, o n??vel de

produc?a?o o?timo e? elevado. Assim, o retorno de um desvio sera? menor e a punic?a?o mais

branda. Embora o coeficiente de externalidade na?o influencie diretamente a viabilidade

de um acordo, coeficientes elevados funcionam como uma punic?a?o pela na?o cooperac?a?o.

Desta forma, coeficientes elevados permitem n??veis de produc?a?o mais eficientes, devido ao

ganho da cooperac?a?o ser superior. Mas se o coeficiente de externalidade for muito elevado,

embora a viabilidade do contrato na?o varie explicitamente com este termo, pode ser que

na?o haja equil??brio Pareto superior ao equil??brio de Cournot, ou mesmo a? um equil??brio

trivial com produc?a?o nula. O mesmo ocorre com o custo fixo neste modelo.

Por fim, cabe ressaltar que o modelo usa hipo?teses pouco realistas. A primeira esta?

relacionada com o custo de produc?a?o e o tempo de produc?a?o. Neste modelo, a firmas

produzem por um tempo infinito, pois o custo de extrac?a?o na?o aumenta com o tempo.

Mas esta hipo?tese surge da necessidade do modelo usar a estacionaridade problema e da

soluc?a?o, como foi ressaltado na sec?a?o 2.3. Um extensa?o poss??vel seria o uso de uma func?a?o

de custo que cresce a medida que o estoque se reduz. Pore?m, esta extensa?o na?o e? trivial,

uma vez que ha? poucos modelos com esta propriedade mesmo dentro da literatura de

organizac?a?o industrial. Outra hipo?tese e? a simetria entre as firmas, que foi usada para

isolar o efeito da incerteza sobre a viabilidade do contrato. Uma outra extensa?o poss??vel

seria um modelo com duas firmas com tecnologia distintas. Assim, haveria tanto o efeito

da incerteza quando a heterogeneidade entre as firmas. Pore?m, este modelo tambe?m na?o

seria trivial, pois possivelmente — dependendo de como o choque ocorre a cada per??odo

— seria necessa?rio usar me?todos de programac?a?o dina?mica estoca?stica, o que torna a

resoluc?a?o do modelo tecnicamente mais dif??cil. Por fim, este modelo trata de ambientes

sem regulac?a?o. Uma extensa?o natural poss??vel seria colocar o papel de um regulador com

poder coercitivo, capaz de interromper a produc?a?o na eventualidade de uma deserc?a?o.

Este modelo poderia reproduzir com um pouco de mais realidade a unitizac?a?o no caso

brasileiro.

Oilfield Unitization Under Dual

Fiscal Regime: The Regulator Role

over the Bargaining

Abstract

We study how the existence of dual fiscal regimes affects the unitization process.

We consider identical firms operating under two different regulatory regimes. The

negotiation of share and production plan is modeled as a bargaining problem and

we solve it using the axiomatic solution proposed by Nash. We show that firms

operating the leases that must share larger portion of its profit with the government

end up being benefited in the negotiation. Furthermore, the regulator can reduce

the distortion generated by the dual fiscal regime if the regulator is impartial with

respect to government revenue and firms profits or worries more about firms than

the government.

3.1 Introduction

In the oil industry, the government grant licenses for companies to search for commercially

feasible deposits of petroleum. The geographical area defined by the government for the

tender process is based on roughly estimates of possible oil leases. Due to the lack of

precise information, sometimes two or more oil companies end up having access to the

same reservoir. Without any regulation, whenever two or more companies have the access

to the same resource, the overexploitation of it will occur as predicted by the common-

pool problem literature. Under this so-called Rule of Capture, each company will try to

extract as much oil as it can, before the other companies do the same. It also increases

the production cost, since both companies have to make capital investments, creating two



70

structures to extract the resource. This is not optimal for the society due the duplication

of costs.

A solution for this problem used by the industry is called unitization. This is an

agreement in which it determines who will be responsible for extracting the resource,

named operator, the production plan, and the profits will be shared. The agreement

sometimes can reduce economic losses from the common-pool problem by 50%, according

to Kim and Mahoney (2002). The negotiation between the parties can take a long time

in general, due to the complexities involved on this agreement. However, sometimes this

bargaining may breaks down and companies’ decision will take into account the rule of

capture to produce, which would be wasteful. Aware of it, a government could demand

firms reach an agreement within a time limit and then offer a take-it-or-leave-it agreement.

Under this scheme, firms would incorporate it in the game to threaten the other parties

during the bargaining process.

Since companies take into account a possible sharing rule offered by the regulator,

it is important to consider the role of legal framework under which companies produce.

Johnston (1994) surveys fiscal regimes around the world and shows that some countries

are adopting the production sharing agreements (PSA) in which the government remains

the owner of the resources and only reimburses the cost of the oil companies and share a

portion of the profit. The two special features of this contract are: (i) The government

can interfere the production plan; (ii) The oil company share the profit with the govern-

ment based on auction that the company won. The interference can occur, for example,

when the bargaining process breaks down and the government offers a take-it-or-leave-it

proposal.

In 2007, Brazil poised to become one of the top oil producers in the world after

discovery a huge reserves in the pre-salt layer. The International Energy Agency (IEA,

2013) estimates the country’s oil production will triple by 2035, turning Brazil into the

world’s sixth-largest oil producer, and the pre-salt layer will account for 52% of total

domestic oil production by 2018, according to the report by Petrobras, Brazil’s semi-

public multinational energy corporation. It is estimated that the total recoverable oil and

natural gas to be about 100 billion barrels of oil equivalent in the pre-salt area, which

would triple the national reserves.

In response, the federal government considered necessary to amend the regulatory

framework in order to create specific rules for the exploration and production of Petroleum

in these areas. The new regulatory framework was proposed by the federal government in

2009 and approved by the Brazilian Congress in 2010, which considered it would afford the

greatest benefit to the country and its people. The system adopted for the pre-salt reserves

is the production sharing agreement. Now, Brazil have at least two fiscal regime for the



71

oil industry, and some of the reserves might be under these two regimes. According to

the Brazilian law, firms operating contiguous leases with access to the same reserve must

unitize their production, and the heterogeneous fiscal regime will affect the negotiation of

the unit agreement.

Using the axiomatic solution for bargaining, we show that even if the firms are

identical in terms of technology and costs, but operating under different fiscal regime,

one of the firm will be benefited in the unitization process. This benefit is associated

to a larger share that a firm receives compared to the profit that the firm is helping to

generate. We consider two possible resolution for the bargaining, that is, two possible

scenarios if the negotiation breaks-down. The first one is the rule of capture, where firms

will compete for the resource, while the other one is the regulator proposal according to

the Brazilian law.

In the next section, we will introduce the Brazilian Fiscal regimes. In Section 3.3

we survey a short literature about unitization. In Section 3.4 we present our environment

of the model and the common-pool problem. In Section 3.5, we introduce the unitization

as a bargaining problem and we solve it using the axiomatic solution propose by Nash.

In Section 3.6 we study the two resolutions considered by this paper, and we conclude in

Section 3.7.

3.2 Brazilian Fiscal Regimes

The fiscal regime of a country is a regulation that rules the exploration and production

of hydrocarbons, hence establishing the rights, obligations and the division of revenues

between the government and companies. Throughout the world, we can find many fiscal

regimes relative to the oil exploration and production (E&amp;amp;P), but the two most common

fiscal regimes are concession and production sharing agreement (PSA).

According to the Brazilian Federal Constitution, enacted in 1988, all national oil

and natural gas reserves were public property and belonged to the Federal Government.

The Union held a natural monopoly over research, exploration, production, refinement,

transportation, importation, and exportation of oil and its by-products. Petrobras, the

Brazilian National Oil Company, was the sole agent to explore the Union’s monopoly.

In 1995, the Brazilian government reformed the oil and gas regulatory framework,

and authorized the Union to contract any company incorporated and headquartered in

Brazil to conduct the activities previously reserved only to Petrobras. It ended the oil and

gas public monopoly in Brazil. The Oil Act, enacted in 1997 by the Congress, allowed

competition in all segments of the oil and gas industry, and established that exploration

and production of oil and gas in Brazil should be carried out under the concession regime.



72

In the concession regime, the exploration, development and production are con-

ducted at the oil company’s sole cost and risk. In return, the concessionaire is granted

a contract that last up to 35 years, becoming the owner of the hydrocarbons extracted

and having exclusive control of operations and holding both commercialization and ex-

portation rights. The contracts are granted based on signature bonus and local content

auction organized by the National Petroleum Agency (NPA). A signature bonus is the

amount of money offered by the bidder to explore and produce the field, paid when the

concession agreement is signed, and the local content represents the bidder’s commitment

to contract a minimum percentage of goods and services from Brazilian companies.

Therefore, according to The Oil Act and concession agreements, the concessionaires

must pay (i) signature bonuses, which consist of a lump sum payment by the winning

company(s) of the bidding procedure upon the signing of the concession agreement; (ii)

royalties, which are defined by law as a financial compensation payable as a result of

production of Petroleum; (iii) annual rental fees, which consist of the value paid annually,

from the execution of the concession agreement and fixed per square kilometer or fraction

of the block area; and (iv) special participation, which is defined as an extraordinary

financial compensation payable only in cases of high volume of production or high prof-

itability. The special participation is a tax over the net revenue of the concessionaire based

on its location, onshore or offshore, and the production level. The two most important

government take in this regime, along with signature bonus, is the royalties and special

participation, in terms of total revenue. According to the Statistical Yearbook of NPA

of 2010, the royalties and special participation accounts for 50.6% and 47.8%, on average

from 2000 to 2009, of the revenue not taking into account the signature bonus.

In late 2006, Petrobras announced it had found evidence of ultra-deep-water oil

reserves beneath the underground salt layer, the so-called pre-salt. This layer extends

along the Brazilian outer continental shelf at about 300 kilometers from the shoreline.

The prospect of huge reserves of hydrocarbons in the pre-salt with low exploratory risk1

raised discussion of whether concessions are the appropriate legal regime to govern the

development of oil and gas in these locations. In response to that, a new regulatory

framework was designed to govern the exploration and production of the oil discovered in

the pre-salt area, and in 2010, Brazil adopted the production sharing agreement regime.

In the PSA, differently from concession contracts, the ownership of the hydrocarbons

is inverted, so instead of it being owned by the oil company, the extracted oil still belongs

to the government. The contractor will, at its own risk, explore, develop and produce the

oil, and in the case of any commercial discovery, such contractor is entitled to receive a

share of the produced oil to reimburse the exploration and production cost, the so-called

1Although the exploratory risk is reduced by the findings from Petrobras, the companies still bears
the development risk, which is considered very high in these areas.



73

cost oil. The remaining oil, the so-called profit oil, is shared between the government

and the contractor according to the terms of the production sharing agreement, which is

based on bid proposed by the winning contractor for the lease auction. Thus, under the

PSA, the government take is paid through its share of profit oil as well the payment of a

signature bonus and royalties.

The 2010 Federal law also established the Petro?leo e Ga?s Natural S.A. (PPSA), a

100% government-owned company, to be responsible for managing the production sharing

agreements and the sale of the government’s share of oil output. The company represented

the Union in the PSA and in the unitization process, but it has no responsibility over

exploration and production activities. PPSA does not bear exploratory and development

risk, but it has a mandatory participation in all consortia formed as well as the right to

nominate the majority of the operational committee, including its president who has a

tie-breaking vote. The Brazilian PSA also established the Petrobras as the sole operator

of the oilfields, and it must have at least 30% of each field tendered. Petrobras may

increase its participation in the oil field by participating with the other parties. Finally,

when the reserve is under two different leases, possibly under two different fiscal regimes,

it is mandatory to unitize the production in order to reduce the cost of production of the

reserve, and as soon as one consortia finds its reserves goes beyond its area, it must notice

NPA. If the parties involved in the unitization process do not reach an agreement before

a deadline specified in the PSA, the NPA will propose an agreement, and in case it is not

accept by the parties, their contract can be terminated.

As an example, the Table 3.1 presents the companies and government take under

two different regimes. Under concession, it considers the royalty, denoted by ? as 10%,

while in PSA we consider 15%, which is following the concession and PSA laws. Under

concession, we consider the special participation, denoted by SP, of 20%, and under PSA

the profit share is 50%. We consider a tax of 25% and the CSLL of 9%, for this example.2

It is clear that under PSA the government take is greater than under concession, which

should be related to the lower exploratory risk that consortia would bear.

Consequently, Brazil now has a dual fiscal regime for hydrocarbons exploration and

production: while the PSA governs exploration and production of the oil fields located

in the pre-salt area as well as those considered strategic by a presidential decree, the

concession regime governs most of the other fields. However, since it is not possible to

delimit the areas according to the reserve, there will be situation in which companies

have to unitize their production, even operating under different regimes. This will be the

focus of this paper, to study how the dual fiscal regime will affect the negotiation of the

3.3 Literature

The US oil industry flourished after 1890s and started an oil rush in many states in

the country. In most of the states, the ownership of the underground resources was

initially given to the company that extracted the oil, the so-called rule of capture. A

landowner neighbor of a land in which the oil was found had incentives to rent his land

to an oil company, which would extract the oil probably from the same oil reserve. This

competition and the decreasing crude oil prices experienced until 1970 became a concern

for the industry, and a topic for economist to discuss.

Gary Libecap and Steven Wiggins studied the competition in the industry and its

rent dissipation, among others, during the 1980s. Libecap and Wiggins (1984) show

an estimate from Federal Oil Conservation Board that the estimated recovery rate was

only 20 ? 25% under competitive extraction, while under controlled withdrawal could
be 85 ? 90%. As firm compete for migratory oil and gas, they dissipate reservoir rents
with excessive capital, too rapid production, and lost total recovery. However, with a

complete unitization agreement among the producers, a single firm is designated as the

unit operator to develop the entire reservoir. The gains from an agreement can be huge

both from savings in capital costs and from increasing the overall production that can be

from two to five times unregulated output.

Even though there is a huge rent dissipation due to the rule of capture, studies



75

showed that by 1947, only 12 in 3,000 fields in the US were fully unitized. Libecap and

Wiggins (1984, 1985a) considered three possible causes for this failure of reaching an

agreement. The first one is the concentration in the field, as the more firms have access

to the same tract, the harder will be to reach a mutual interest agreement. Another rea-

son, related to the previous one, is the heterogeneity of firms’ interest and information.

As most of the unitization process started during development phase after the commer-

cial petroleum deposits have been found, the information about firms’ tracts and their

estimated about the value of it diverges, making it harder for parties reach an agreement.

In a comparative analysis, Libecap and Wiggins (1985b) evaluated how different

regulatory policies affects the unitization process in the US. They chose three US states

that have different regulatory policies with high production level. In Wyoming was ob-

served high level of success in achieving unitization agreements. In this state, most of

the oil field are federal land, where the policy encourages early exploratory units, before

the commercial petroleum deposits have been found. It allows for large potential gains

from unitization, and ease the bargaining process since the information about the deposit

is more homogeneous. The Brazilian regulatory framework adopted the same principle,

where firms must notice NPA as soon as it is found that the tract extends beyond their

lease. Another incentives provided by the federal policy in the US is that firms are granted

the area for up to 20 years, but if a lease become unitized, the leases are automatically

extended for the life of the unit. In the other states, the unitization typically starts in late

field development, and it was observed lower number of successful unitization agreements.3

More recently, Libecap and Smith (1999, 2001) shows that if the field contains two

(or more) substances that differ in kind (like oil and gas), then it is possible that different

forms of non-unitized ownership and operation (with conflicted production incentives)

may dominate unitized development of the resource.4 According to them, unitization

may not be a Pareto improving in situations where the tract contains oil and gas, due

to different interests about timing and forms of extraction needed. Mohan and Goorha

(2008) showed that the nature of contractual incompleteness of the unitization could also

provide wrong incentives to firms, resulting in an under-investment during the exploratory

phase.

In a setting more closely related to ours, Smith (1987) solves an axiomatic bar-

gaining, and shows that small-interests holders are benefited in the unitization when the

alternative solution is the rule of capture. This idea follows Libecap and Wiggins (1984,

1985a) hypothesis, where it was shown that small firms are reluctant to enter agreements,

expecting that large firms offer concession for the small firms. Smith argues that, if arbi-

tration were possible, and neutral with respect to distribution of the profit, large-interests

firms would issue a threat to invoke arbitration, if the cost for it is not sufficiently high.

Differently from our model, the firms’ difference is exogenous; he does not consider the

fiscal regime the firms are operating. Thus, our model shows explicitly the effect of the

fiscal regime over the bargaining position of the firms involved in a unitization process.

Also, we show the role of a regulator that consider both government take and firms profit.5

3.4 The Environment

We consider two firms in this model, which are operating over their granted land to

explore and develop oil, but the oil extracted by the firms comes from the a single reservoir

underneath their areas. In our model, the average production cost is represented by the

function ???(?1,?2), and it satisfies the following assumption of externality, leading to the

common-pool problem:

Assumption 1 ???(?1,?2) = ??? + ?(?1 + ?2) and
????
????

= ? &gt; 0.

Thus, the extraction by one of the firms leads to an increase in the production cost of the

other firm. We suppose the price of the produced oil is given by ?, thus the gross profit

function for a firm ? is

????(?1,?2) = [? ? ???(?1,?2)] ??. (3.1)

Each firm may be operating under different fiscal regime. We consider two possible

types of contract that can be used by the government to lease areas for exploration and

development of oil. The fiscal regime determines the economic relation between firms and

government, and in particular, what is the government take on the total output revenue.

The first type of contract we describe is the PSA, described in Section 3.2. Under this

contract, the profit from the production is shared with the government according to the

parameter ??, established during the auction, and the firm still needs to pay royalties to

the government. The (net) profit function is

??(?1,?2) = (1 ? ??) [????(?1,?2) ? ????] , (3.2)

and, as we assume there is no tax, thus the government revenue is given by

5Regarding the PSA contracts, Aghion and Quesada (2010) study the moral hazard and risk sharing
problem that affects the production under different contracts, where they consider that government
may change the agreement to increase its take, like what happened in Venezuela and Bolivia, and thus
companies anticipate this possibility of holdup and under-invest. For a survey about the PSA fiscal
regime, see Johnston (1994), and for a comparison of the legal framework between Brazil and the US, see
Pinto (2013).



77

?(?1,?2) = ?? [????(?1,?2) ? ???] + ???. (3.3)

The other type of fiscal regime is a concession contract, which grants the lease to a

firm in exchange for a fixed payment in advance and requires the firm to pay the royalties

based on the production. The advanced payment is sunk for the firm at the exploratory

and development phase, so the production level takes into account only the royalty, along

with price and production cost. We consider royalties as a function of the production

level. Therefore, the (net) profit function and government revenue can be represented by

Equations (3.2) and (3.3) when ?? is zero.

In order to easy the computation, we will also consider that firms are identical, so

?1 = ?2 = ?, and the royalty will be the same under both regimes, based on the production

of the firms, thus ?1 = ?2 = ?. By doing it, we are isolating the problem of the fiscal

regime, excluding the heterogeneity of the firms and evaluating only the impact of the

existence of two fiscal regimes over the unitization process. In addition, throughout this

paper, we will consider only interior solution. In the next subsection we will show the

common-pool problem under these fiscal regimes.

3.4.1 The common-pool problem

In this section we introduce the common-pool problem existing in this setting. In order

to do so, we examine two benchmark cases: (i) when firms act non-cooperatively by

strategically choosing a production level seeking to maximize his own profit; and (ii) firms

act as one and seeks to maximize the joint profit.

First, let us consider what would happen if both firms were acting according to the

rule of capture. It establishes that the ownership of the resource extracted is given to firm

responsible for extracting it. This allocation rule induces firms to act strategically, seeking

to extract as much as possible without considering its negative effects over the other firm.

A simple solution concept that captures this behavior is the Nash equilibrium, which will

represent the case when firms are competing against each other when the allocation rule

is determined by the rule of capture. Henceforth, this solution concept will be called as

rule of capture solution.

Firms seeking to maximize their profit function (3.2) do not take into account the

fiscal regime ??, as it is just a fixed proportion of its profit. On the other hand, the

royalty ? acts as an additional marginal cost for the firm, thus reducing the output level

of both firms. As we consider both firms identical in terms of cost structure, the rule of

capture solution involves both firms choosing the same output level denoted by ?? , where

? indicates the Nash equilibrium concept. The externality introduced in the previous



78

section reduces the total profit that firms could make if they behave as a single firm

operating in two different fiscal regimes, as they would be internalizing the externality of

the setting, as we can see in the following proposition.

Proposition 10 The total profit under the rule of capture is strictly less than the profit

made by a single firm operating two distinct areas.

Proof. Consider the problem of a single firm operating two areas under different fiscal

regime, which is given by

max
?1,?2

??
?=1,2

(1 ? ??) [????(?1,?2) ? ???] . (3.4)

We denote ?*? the solution for this problem and ?
* = ?*1 +?

*
2. The first order condition for

this problem implies that the total marginal profit is greater than zero, while summing

the first order condition of each firm from the rule of capture solution, using the same

notation ?? = ??1 + ?
?
2 , it implies

? ? ??? ? ?
??

2
? ??? = 0 &amp;lt;? ? ??* ? ?

?*

2
? ??*. (3.5)

The inequality above implies that the total production under a single firm operation is

less than under a competitive solution, i.e. ?? &gt; ?*. Since the cost function is strictly

convex, and prices are fixed, thus the total output from competition is strictly less than

the profit made by a single firm operating both areas.

The common-pool problem occurs when a firm does not take into account the neg-

ative externality the others firms will bear due to its production. In the oil industry, this

would mean that firms should reduce its production, since the costs become higher due

to competition, as they would have to introduce more costly ways of extraction. In our

static model, we are not considering the stock level and the cost associated to it, but the

competition induces firms to produce more at higher costs, and thus the profit reduces.

The total profit loss due to competition could be internalize if firms cooperate and

then split the profit between them. However, it is not a trivial problem to decide the

proportion of the profit that each player will receive. In the next section we solve this

problem using the Nash’s Bargaining solution.

3.5 The Bargaining Problem

Consider a model in which two firms found that they have access to the same oil reservoir.

Due to the common-pool problem, competition would reduce the total profit that would

be possible to achieve if they cooperate. However, negotiating a cooperation agreement



79

involves attrition about sharing rule for the profit. According to Osborne and Rubinstein

(1990), this is a typical bargaining situation, because cooperating is mutually beneficial

and there is a conflict of interest about which agreement to conclude.

We are interested in studying how the dual regimes affects the negotiation between

firms. Thus, we model the unitization process as a Nash solution to a bargaining game

between both firms over the agreement that includes the production plan (?1,?2), and

a sharing rule ? ? [0,1], where ? represents the joint-profit portion given to firm 1.
Suppose the profit function of each firm is denoted by ?? (?1,?2), so the joint-profit is

? (?1,?2) =
??

? ?? (?1,?2). As it was discussed above, sometimes the bargaining process

breaks down, so the firms would compete for the resource or the government could offer

a take-it-or-leave-it agreement. We will analyze both resolution on Section 3.6. For the

moment, these threat points are denoted by ??. Nash (1950) showed that we can solve

this problem by the following maximization

max
(?,?1,?2)??

{?? (?1,?2) ? ?1} · {(1 ? ?) ? (?1,?2) ? ?2} (BP)

where ? = {(?,?1,?2) : ? ? [0,1] and ?? ? R+ for ? = 1,2} is the feasible choice set.

Figure 3.1 shows a representation of the stake of the bargaining. Both vertical and

horizontal axis represents the profit of each firm, in particular, the vertical axis represents

firm 1 profit, and the horizontal axis represents firm 2 profit. The green line represents

the profit possibility frontier, which is found by solving the following problem, for each

possible ?2,

max
?1,?2

?1(?1,?2) s.t.?2(?1,?2) = ?2.

The point ? = (?1,?2) represents the threat point of each firm, and it is given by the

outside option that firms have. For example, a firm could prefer not to agree to any deal

proposed, and decide to compete for the resource according to the rule of capture, if it is

possible. Thus, the profit this firm would have is equal to the rule of capture profit level.

However, due to the common-pool problem, we can see that there exist deals that can

improve both firms payoff, represented in the blue area.



80

Figure 3.1: Optimal production plan

According to the axiomatic bargaining proposed by Nash, we know that the solution

must be Pareto optimal, otherwise there would still be a room for a costless negotiation

that could improve both players. Since both firms are splitting the profit generated,

it would be optimal for them when they choose the production plan (?1,?2) such that

maximize the total profit ?(?1,?2). Let ?
* = (?*1,?

*
2) be the optimal production plan

when players cooperate and produce at the quantity that maximize the total profit ?(?).

Therefore, under a unitization we can solve the problem of common pool, since only one

of the firms will explore the reservoir, and in order to maximize his payoff, he must choose

the optimal production, which will generate the highest payoff for both firms.

Let ?* = ?(?*1,?
*
2), thus the unitization problem can be reduced to the problem of

splitting the profit, i.e.

max
?

{??* ? ?1} · {(1 ? ?) ?* ? ?2} . (BP’)

Now, the problem of how the firms actually share profit shows the importance of

the threat points, as we can see it clearly from the first order condition:

? =
1

2
+
?1 ? ?2

2?*
and 1 ? ? =

1

2
+
?2 ? ?1

2?*
(3.6)

From these equations, it is clear that whenever the threat point is the same for both

firms, they will share the profit equally to each other, otherwise one of them will end up

receiving a large share. Clearly, player ? will have greater share when he generates more

profit at the threat point.



81

In the next section we present two models of breakdowns we induces the threat point

of the firms. Based on them, we study the solution of the bargaining problem introduced

above.

3.6 Two Models of Negotiation Breakdown

The unitization process involves a complicated phase where companies work on the deal

they want to reach. The firms negotiating the deal are usually aware of what the other

company can do if an agreement is not reached, and they use it to get the best possible

deal. This is the threat point considered by the Nash solution for a bargaining. As we saw

in the previous section, the bargaining solution will depend on the threat point that comes

from the solution of possible resolutions the game have. A natural threat point would

be a non-cooperative solution, when firms compete for the oil and face the common-pool

problem. The other option is when the regulator proposes an agreement and firms can

accept it or not, following the idea of the Brazilian regulatory framework. If they do not

accept, the government will terminate their contract and they will end up with no profit.

In this section, we will see how the fiscal regimes affect the unitization, first consid-

ering the benchmark case, where firms will compete for the resource according to the rule

of capture. In this situation, both firms can improve their profit due to the common-pool

problem by cooperating, the question is how the fiscal regimes will affect the bargaining

of the shares and thus if it will involve any transfer between players.

3.6.1 Rule of capture resolution

The rule of capture states that the ownership of the resource extract from the nature

belongs to the one who extracted it. In the past, in some countries like United States, the

government did not interfere in the competition in the oil industry. This is our benchmark,

as now we will consider the rule of capture as our status quo condition, in the sense that if

firms cannot reach an agreement, they will compete according to the rule of capture. As

we saw before, it can be viewed as the Nash equilibrium for the common-pool problem,

which solution was called rule of capture solution. Thus, the threat point is given by

?? = ?
?
? . By using it as a threat point, it becomes an individual rationality condition,

which is the minimum a firm must receive to accept a deal from the bargaining.

As seen in the previous section, the solution of the bargaining is such that a firm

will receive a portion of the joint profit, ?? ?*, when the production plan is the one that

maximize the joint profit, and ?* is a function of the threat points, given by Equation

(3.6).

Proposition 11 The firm that will receive larger shares is the one with lower government



82

share.

Proof. The rule of capture solution can be found by solving the system of equations that

induces the Nash equilibrium of the game, which is the following: The output choice for

each firm ? solves

??? = arg max
??

(1 ? ??) [????(?1,?2) ? ???] . (3.7)

It is clear that the output choice of each player does not depend on the fiscal regime

??, as it is a constant for each firm. However, the profit is a decreasing function of ??. So,

suppose, without loss of generality, that ?2 &gt; ?1, thus the firm 2 has lower profit than

firm 1, that is, ??1 &gt; ?
?
2 , and finally, according to the Equation (3.6), ?

? &gt; 1/2. Thus,

the firm that shares large portion of the profit receives lower share of the total profit.

Although firm 2 received larger portion of the joint profit, it might be the case that

he will receive less than his facilities usage generates as profit due to a transfer to firm 1

in terms of profit share. The role of the transfer is to insure the deal will be reach, and

the firm with larger benefit from cooperation will be more willing to pay to the other firm.

We can see that the firm with higher threat point gets a larger share of the profit, but

does this payoff is equal to the firm contribution for the total profit? Let the transfer be

define as the amount of payoff a player receives in excess of his contribution to total profit.

So, for example, the transfer received by the player 1 is given by ??1 = ?
? ?* ? ?1(?*1,?*2).

When ??1 &gt; 0 means that the firm 2 is giving implicit transfer for firm 1 to be able to

reach an agreement. This transfer occurs by giving by a larger share of the profit to one

player in order to guarantee the deal. At the solution, this transfer is given by

??1 =
?2(?

*) ? ?1(?*)
2

+
??1 ? ??2

2
, (3.8)

and ??2 = ???1 . We can see the representation of the transfer in the Figure 3.2. In
this figure, firm 2 is receiving a transfer from firm 1, after using the threat point as his

bargaining position, since player 2 won’t be benefited as much as player 1.

Note that the firm 1 will receive the transfer when ?2(?
*) ? ??2 &gt; ?1(?*) ? ??2 , that

is, when his gain from cooperation is less than the other player’s gain. The idea here is

that the player with lower gain from cooperation will ask a transfer in order to agree with

the terms of the deal. The cooperation generates more benefits for the other firm, hence

he would be willing to transfer some of its benefit from cooperation and still be in a better

situation than the status quo, where the regulator would impose them an agreement.



83

Figure 3.2: Transfer

Before studying who receives transfer, we need the following lemma. The problem

for a single firm operating two areas with different fiscal regimes is also called cooperation

problem, when two firms do not acts strategically to extract larger profit from the lease.

Lemma 4 If a single firm were operating under two different fiscal regimes, the area

responsible to produce more and to generate more profit for the firm is the one with lower

government share.

Proof. Without loss of generality, assume ?1 &gt; ?2. First, let us show that ?
*
2 &gt; ?

*
1. The

first order condition to solve problem (3.4) implies for each firm ? the following equation

?????(?
*
1,?

*
2)

???
= ? +

1 ? ??
1 ? ??

??*? , (3.9)

and using the Equation (3.1) we can compare both first order condition through the

following equation

? ? ??* ? 2??*1 =
1 ? ?2
1 ? ?1

(? ? ??* ? 2??*2) . (3.10)

By the assumption ?1 &gt; ?2, we have
1??2
1??1

&gt; 1, and thus it is clear that ?2 &gt; ?1 by the

Equation (3.10), proving the first part of this lemma. Now, let us prove that the plant on

area 2 has greater profit than the facilities located on the area that shares larger portion

of the profit with the government. In order to prove it, we assume again that ?1 &gt; ?2,

which implies that 1??2
1??1

&gt; 1 &gt; 1??1
1??2

and ?2 &gt; ?1. According to the first order condition

state by Equation (3.9), we have the following inequalities

????1(?
*
1,?

*
2)

??1
= ? +

1 ? ?2
1 ? ?1

??*2 &gt; ? + ??
*
2 &gt; ? + ??

*
1 &gt; ? +

1 ? ?1
1 ? ?2

??*1 =
????2(?

*
1,?

*
2)

??2
, (3.11)



84

and by concavity of the profit function, it implies that ???1(?
*
1,?

*
2) &amp;lt;???2(?

*
1,?

*
2), and thus

?1(?
*
1,?

*
2) &amp;lt;?2(?

*
1,?

*
2).

The production plan as a solution of the cooperation problem is affected by the

fiscal regime. The choice is such that the firm that pays lower portion of the profit to

the government will produce more, increasing its profit, while the other one will reduce

the production, internalizing the externality, which is now a composition of the fiscal

regimes and the externality parameter. The regimes makes each firms be affected by the

externality with different intensity. The firm with larger ?? will be less sensitive to the

externality, as we see the fraction (1 ? ??)/(1 ? ??). Note that in this problem, each firm
has a weight given by 1 ? ??, so, the firm with lower ?? will have larger importance in
the maximization problem, and so it would be responsible to generate larger profit, while

the other firm should reduce its production in order to reduce the negative externality.

Therefore, the firm with lower ? can increase the production and thus increase the profit,

while having a minor negative effect from the other firm.

Now we can study which firm receives a transfer ??? . When the fiscal regime is the

same, that is ?1 = ?2, at the rule of capture solution we have ?
?
1 = ?

?
2 , and at the

cooperative solution, firms’ profit will be the same, i.e. ?*1 = ?
*
2. Thus, there will not be

a transfer from one firm to another. However, when the fiscal regime is different, we have

the following proposition.

Proposition 12 The firm receiving transfer is the one with larger government share.

Proof. Assume, without loss of generality, that ?1 &gt; ?2. Since firms have identical cost

functions, we have ????1 = ???
?
2 , while according to the Lemma 4, we found that ???

*
1 &amp;lt;???

*
2.

Using this two relations, we find the following inequalities

???*1 ? ???
?
1 &amp;lt;???

*
2 ? ???

?
2&amp;lt;

1 ? ?2
1 ? ?1

(???*2 ? ???
?
2) ,

and thus, rewriting it we find ?*2 ???2 &gt; ?*1 ???2 , the condition which shows that ??1 &gt; 0.
The inequality above holds, since ???*2 ? ????2 is positive if ?1 &gt; ?2. It cannot be negative,
because it could not be the solution for the cooperation problem, as the firm 2 weights is

greater than firm 1.

Therefore, although firm are identical, by operating under different fiscal regimes

creates a distortion which one firm can use it strategically to gain more rent from the

unit deal, in the sense that firm 1 will earn more that it is generating for the unit. In

the next section, we will introduce the role of the regulator, following the Brazilian legal

framework. He will be responsible to propose a deal whenever firms can’t reach one. We

will study how it affects the bargaining position and how firm use it strategically to gain

more rent from the unit.



85

3.6.2 Regulator resolution

According to the Brazilian legal framework, during a unitization process firms will have a

period to negotiate and try to reach an agreement, however after a deadline, the regulator

will propose an agreement. This agent takes into account the government role and the

firms’ role. The government is interested in collecting revenue to finance his policies,

revenue that is based on profit share and royalties from the firms. According to our

model, the government utility is given by

?(?) =
??
?

?? [????(?) ? ???] + ? (?1 + ?2) (3.12)

so the government has two revenue sources: (i) profit share from the PSA; (ii) and royal-

ties. The profit share is aligned with firms’ goal, which is to maximize their profit, however

the royalty adds an extra burden to the firms. In some cases, the government would pre-

fer firms to operate above the optimal production level in order to collect royalties and

increase its utility.

The regulator role in this model is to consider both firms objective and government

objective. A simple way to model it is by assigning weights for firms’ profit and govern-

ment’s revenue, which we denote ? ? [0,1], where ? &gt; 1/2 means that the regulator cares
more about revenues than profits, and otherwise for ? &amp;lt;1/2. Therefore, when ? = 0,

means that regulator just care about firms’ profits, or firms’ efficiency, by not considering

the government’s revenue. On the opposite way, for ? = 1, the regulator is totally aligned

to the government and thus it only worry about revenues. The regulator will be impar-

tial when ? = 1/2, since it assigns the same weight for firms’ profits and government’s

revenues. Hence, we can write the regulator utility as

?(?) = ??(?) + (1 ? ?)?(?). (3.13)

We can rewrite it as a weighted average of firms profit and the royalty term, using the

weight denoted by ?? = ??? + (1 ? ?)(1 ? ??), in which the first term is related to the
government take given the regulator weight for it, while the second term is referred to the

firms’ profits. The regulator utility is now given by

?(?) =
??
?

?? [????(?) ? ???] + ?? (?1 + ?2) . (3.14)

First note that when ? = 1/2, we have ?? = 1/2 and then the solution for the

maximization of ?(?) would be the same as efficient solution, where firms operate under

no regime, i.e. ?? = 0 and ? = 0. Also, in this equation we can see the efficiency trade-



86

off the regulator face, similarly to the government, in which increasing the production

generates more utility to the regulator through higher level of government take. It is clear

that when the regulator only carries about the firms, it would find the same solution as

the cooperation’s problem. However, increasing the importance of the government, higher

level of production can generates more government’s take, yielding higher benefit for the

regulator. The first order condition for this problem implies

?????(?
?
1 ,?

?
2 )

???
= (1 ? 2?)

1 ? ??
??

? +
??
??
???? . (3.15)

When ? = 1/2, this equation would be equal to ???? , which is the same condition

for the efficient production, where firms cooperate and do not take into account the fiscal

regime. Note that when ? = 0, we have the same first order condition as the cooperation

problem. The first term related to the royalties is decreasing in ?, so the highest value

it assume is 1, the same as in the cooperation problem. As the regulator increases the

importance of the government revenue, this term decreases indicating he would be willing

to increase the production, when we consider only the effect of the royalties. The second

term is related to the externality and the fiscal regimes. If ? = 0 or firms are in the same

regime, this term is equal to the term in the cooperation first order condition. However,

suppose ?2 &gt; ?1, that is, firm 2 share a larger portion of its profit with the government,

the fraction ?2/?1 will be greater than (1 ? ?2)/(1 ? ?1) and increasing in ?. Thus, the
optimal production level for firm 1 will be reduced compare to the cooperative solution,

and this reduction will be amplified as ? increases. On the other hand, firm 2 will increase

its production.

Now, the firm that will produce the most will be determined by the regulator align-

ment ? and the fiscal regime ??, which is shown in the following proposition.

Proposition 13 A firm will produce more than the other if, and only if, it shares lower

portion of its profit with the government and the regulator is more aligned with the firms,

i.e. ??1 &gt; ?
?
2 if, and only if ?2 &gt; ?1 and ? &amp;lt;1/2.

Proof. We can check that by subtracting the first order condition for ?1 and ?2, and

analyzing the following equality

? ? ??? ? 2???1 =
?2
?1

(?
? ? ??? ? 2???2

)?
, (3.16)

as before, but now we are comparing ?1 and ?2. If ? &amp;lt;1/2 and ?2 &gt; ?1, then ?1 &gt; ?2,

and thus ??1 &gt; ?
?
2 .

According to Equation (3.14), we saw that ?? is the weight for firm ? in the weighted

average that represented the regulator utility. Under the condition above, we know that



87

firm 1 will produce more and it will have greater weight than firm 2, so we can expect

that firm 1 will generate greater profit level than firm 2, if the royalties are equal to zero.

Proposition 14 Suppose there are no royalties, that is, ? = 0. A firm will have larger

profit under the regulator solution if, and only if, it shares lower portion of its profit with

the government and the regulator is more aligned with the firms, i.e. ??1 &gt; ?
?
2 if, and

only if ?2 &gt; ?1 and ? &amp;lt;1/2.

Proof. We can check that using the same idea used before for the cooperation problem.

More specifically, we can prove that at the interior solution for the regulator problem,

???1(?
?) &gt; ???2(?

?) if, and only if, ? &amp;lt;1/2 and ?2 &gt; ?1. In order to check that, we can

compare the first order solution, when ? = 0, in which

????1(?
?
1 ,?

?
2 )

??1
=

?2
?1
???2 &gt; ??

?
2 &gt; ??

?
1 &gt;

?1
?2
???1 =

????2(?
?
1 ,?

?
2 )

??2
, (3.17)

and again, using the concavity of ??? we have ??1 &gt; ?
?
2 .

This proof can fail if ? &gt; 0 is sufficiently high, because we would not use the fact

that the partial derivative with respect to ?? is positive, which certifies us that the solution

is at the increasing part of the profit function. Note that here, the regulator are increasing

the production of the firm have greater ??, which is the firm ? weight in the regulator

utility. In addition, since the first order condition implies that the production level is at

the increasing part of the profit function, when ? = 0, that we can say that by increasing

the quantity of firm ?, the regulator is increasing its profit level.

Numerical analysis

Unfortunately, we cannot use the same idea to prove that ?1(?
?) &gt; ?2(?

?), because ?

can invert the inequality sign, and it does not allow us to prove the converse of the

statement. In order to provide insights for this problem, we solved this regulator problem

numerically and it is possible to identify parameter regions in which the profit of one firm

will be greater than the other.

An illustration of this solution is plotted in the Figure 3.3 below. This figures are

the contour plot of the difference of firm 1 profit relative to firm 2, i.e. ?1(?
?) ? ?2(??)

when ?2 = 0.4. The lighter color means that ?1(?
?) &gt; ?2(?

?), and on the other hand,

the darker color means ?1(?
?) &amp;lt;?2(?

?). In the plot on the left, it was assumed ? = 3,

while in the plot on the right, it was assumed ? = 2. As we can see, the upper right and

the lower left corners of the figure are the regions of (?1,?) implies greater profit level for

firm 1 than firm 2. The vertical line at ?1 = 0.4 clear represents a condition to identify

who earns more profit. However, the ? will be a function of the parameters of the model,



88

Figure 3.3: ?1(?
?) ? ?2(??) when ?2 = 0.4, for ? = 3 and ? = 2, respectively.

like the regimes, cost and externality level, as we can see by comparing both of the plots.

In summary, we can argue that the firm that share less profit will generate more profit

relative to the other firm, when the regulator is sufficiently aligned with the firms, that

is, worries more about the profit of the firm than the government revenue.

Returning to the bargaining problem, when firms use the solution of the regulator

to threat as an alternative for the bargaining problem. Using the Equation (3.6) and the

numerical solution explained above, we can say that firm 1 will have greater share than

firm 2, i.e. ?? &gt; 1/2, if the firms profit share portion is less than firm 2 share and the

regulator worries more about firms profit, or when firm 1 shares more of its profits and

the regulator gives more importance for government revenue.

Even though firm 1 receives a larger portion of the joint profit under the condition

mentioned above, the transfer that a firm will make to the other does not depend on ?,

according to the numerical exercise. Interestingly, the transfer appears to depend only on

the fiscal regime, and the transfer will be positive for the firm that shares larger portion

of its profit to the government, that is, firm 1 will receive a transfer if ?1 &gt; ?2. The

illustration of this solution is in the Figure 3.4, where we show a contour plot of the firm

1 transfer, and the lighter color means ??1 &gt; 0 and the darker color means firm 1 pays

transfer to firm 2. We assumed again that ?2 = 0.4. Note that the transfer do not depend

on the regulator parameter ?, but only on the fiscal regime. Hence, as in the rule of

capture situation, the firm that will be benefited is the one that shares a larger portion

of its profit to the government.

3.6.3 Comparing the solutions by numerical analysis

Another question we explore here is whether the existence of the regulator increases or

decreases the transfer needed to reach an agreement. To address this case, we will compare

the transfer when players are imposed the regulator deal, where the transfer is denote by

??? , with the case when players extract oil based on the rule of capture. Let ?
?
? be the

transfer when the threat point is given by the Nash equilibrium. The answer to this

question can be found by subtracting the absolute value of the transfer in each situation,

and if both values are positive, we have

??? ? ?
?
? =

??? ? ???
2

?
??? ? ???

2
?? ?? ? ??? =

??? ? ???
2

?
??? ? ???

2
, (3.18)

hence, all we need is to compare the threat points if the firm receiving the transfer is the

same. Looking at this equations, the transfer under the regulator setting would be larger

than under the rule of capture if, and only if ??? ???? &gt; ??? ???? , that is, the firm receiving
the transfer will have larger transfer whenever difference of the profit under the regulator

choice is larger than under rule of capture. The larger is the difference between players

profit in each threat point situation, the larger will be the transfer needed to reach an

agreement. The transfer occurs due to the fiscal regime players are operating, and not

by their production and cost function, since we assumed they are identical. Therefore,

the role of the regulator should be the one to minimize the misallocation of the rents,

reducing the transfer between players.

So far, we identified the player who will be benefited in the unitization, when op-

erating in a dual fiscal regime, whether firms threat according to the rule of capture or

according to the regulator solution. Nevertheless, an important question now is whether

the regulator are able to reduce the distortion caused by the dual fiscal regime. We should



90

expected that the role of the regulator in an economy to be such that reduce the distortion

caused by a previous policy.

In order to check whether the regulator is reducing the distortion, we can use the

Equation (3.18). Note that according to the equation, the distortion will be lower when

the difference in the profit evaluated at the threat point solution is lower. The Figure

3.5 below illustrates that the distortion is increasing with respect to ?, that is, the more

importance the regulator gives to the government’s revenue, the more distortion it will

generate, and higher will be the transfer. However, the transfer will be lower than the

transfer using the rule of capture as a threat point, as long as the regulator is impartial

between government revenue and firms profit, that is, when ? = 1/2. If the regulator

worries more about government’s take, than the distortion in the economy will be higher,

the transfer needed to reach an agreement will be larger.

Figure 3.5: Transfer comparison

On the horizontal axis of this plot is all possible alignment between the regulator

and government, and on the vertical axis is the transfer that firm 1 receives. We assume

that ?1 &gt; ?2. The blue line in this figure represents the transfer when firms threat

according to the rule of capture, while the orange line represents the transfer when firms

threat according to the regulator proposal. As we can see, the transfer associated to the

regulator’s problem will be lower if ? &amp;lt;1/2.

3.7 Conclusion

In this paper, we studied the effects of the dual fiscal regime over the unitization ne-

gotiation. The new regulatory framework for the pre-salt areas in Brazil introduced the

production sharing agreement to lease the oil field for exploration and development. How-

ever, the concession contracts will co-exist in different areas, but some of them might be

contiguous to the pre-salt area. Thus, the study proposed here shed a light about the

distortion the dual regime will impose to the firms and how firms will strategically use

the regulator as a threat to be benefited in the negotiation.



91

Our paper modeled the negotiation of the unitization agreement as a bargaining

problem and solved it using the axiomatic solution proposed by Nash (1950). We showed

that even if the firms are identical, but operating under different fiscal regime, one of the

firm will be benefited. This benefit is associated to a larger share that a firm receives than

the profit that the firm are helping to generate. This finding holds for the two possible

resolution considered here, that is, two possible scenarios if the negotiation breaks-down.

The rule of capture was used as a benchmark, where firms compete for the resource

suffering from the common-pool problem, while the other one is the regulator proposal

according to the Brazilian law. We also showed that the regulator could reduce this

distortion as long as he is impartial between government take and firms profit or it is

more worried about firms profit than government revenue.

Finally, the future steps of this research should consider finding analytically the

regions that defines the player benefited by the fiscal regime. It can also study the dynamic

setting, there price is uncertain and firms operating in different fiscal regime might be

interested in producing in a different timing to reduce the risks. In the concession, firms

are able to choose how fast they can produce, while in the PSA, since the firm is a partner

of the regulator, the board might not accept a faster recovery rate.
