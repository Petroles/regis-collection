Abstract

Important aspects that govern railway embankments, namely, high–speed
railways are, on one hand, the strict requirements during construction (material
quality, state parameters and mechanical properties limits) associated with gen-
erally relatively short construction time available and, on the other hand, the
strict requirements on residual settlements concerning serviceability conditions,
which are inherent to mechanical performance of embankment layers during and
after construction. Therefore, performance based tests should play an impor-
tant role through an integrated design process starting from site investigation,
design, construction and maintenance. In this context, full scale trials assume
great importance to establish a methodology either on the establishment of com-
paction conditions and on promoting continuous stiffness evaluation, aiming to
meet high quality requirements and reduce construction time. This is devel-
oped through this study involving advanced laboratory and field investigations
of different materials.

A laboratory test campaign was performed on two materials, a clayey sand
and a crushed aggregate employed in field investigation. Void ratio was fixed for
each material and molding water content was varied in order to reproduce in situ
state conditions. Strength and stiffness were determined by means of triaxial
tests. Focus was given to hydro–mechanical behaviour on the very small and
large strain domain of clayey sand due to non negligible fine fraction. Results
showed marked influence of molding water content on the hydro–mechanical
behaviour of both clayey sand and crushed aggregate, yet being stronger on the
former material.

Field investigation involved two full scale trials, a railway and a road trial
embankments. In the railway trial embankment the same materials studied on
the laboratory investigation were employed. Construction of trial layers with
different thicknesses (0.22, 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m) and different moisture con-
tents (2% dry of optimum, optimum and 2% wet of optimum Modified Proctor)
were carried out and state conditions and mechanical properties were evaluated
for several energy levels. Focus was given to mechanical evaluation through spot
and continuous test methods. Moisture content was found to strongly influences
mechanical performance, rather than density, thus reflecting suction effect on
mechanical properties. Comparison between laboratory and field results proofs
results consistency. Further, continuous mechanical evaluation by means of Por-
tanceme?tre represents a great improvement on quality control/quality assurance
(Qa/Qc) of compacted layers.

In road trial embankment another two materials were employed, which lab-
oratory investigation was conducted in the aim of another doctoral thesis. Con-
struction of trial layers with different thicknesses (0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m) but

ix



with similar moisture contents were carried out and, likewise to railway trial
embankment, state conditions and mechanical properties were evaluated for
several energy levels. Moisture content was found have unnoticeable influence
on moduli for the range of moisture content verified in situ. Conversely, dry
density seems to influence mechanical properties, as long as moisture content
does not vary significantly. Comparison between full scale trial and laboratory
results yielded small differences. This results along with the ones obtained from
railway trial embankment assumes great importance taking into account that
design is based on mechanical properties usually determined from laboratory
tests.

Parallel to this study, an experimental program was carried out on road
embankment to monitor, on one hand, layer in–ground vibrations during appli-
cation of impact loads and vibrating loads and, on the other hand, to monitor
roller drum roller during compaction seeking to explore the relationship between
loads and underlying material mechanical properties. Accelerometers and strain
gauges were buried on the capping layer enabling measurement of dynamic re-
sponse and total strains. In–ground dynamic response reflect a single modulus,
though different moduli obtained from dynamic tests performed at layer surface.
Further, vertical drum behaviour was found to be sensitive to changes in under-
lying material stiffness and to be related with in–ground dynamic response.

Keywords: Compaction conditions, moisture content, mechanical behaviour,
modulus, stiffness, strength, unsaturated state, full scale trial, in–ground strain
and dynamic response.

Suma?rio

Os aspectos importantes que governam os aterros ferrovia?rios, nomeada-
mente linhas fe?rreas de alta velocidade, sa?o, por um lado, os elevados requisitos
durante a construc?a?o (qualidade dos materiais, limites para as condic?o?es de es-
tado e para as propriedades meca?nicas) associadas a um tempo de construc?a?o
reduzido e, por outro lado, os elevados requisitos relativos aos assentamentos
residuais durante as condic?o?es de servic?o, que sa?o inerentes ao comportamento
meca?nico durante e apo?s a construc?a?o. Assim, a avaliac?a?o meca?nica atrave?s de
ensaios mecanicistas devera? desempenhar um papel preponderante num processo
que integra a prospecc?a?o, o projecto, a construc?a?o e a manutenc?a?o. Neste con-
texto os aterros experimentais assumem grande importa?ncia quer na definic?a?o
das condic?o?es de compactac?a?o, quer na promoc?a?o do controlo de compactac?a?o
em cont??nuo visando atingir os elevados requisitos de qualidade e a reduc?a?o
do tempo de construc?a?o. Tal e? desenvolvido no presente estudo que envolve a
investigac?a?o avanc?ada em laborato?rio e em campo de diferentes materiais.

A campanha de laborato?rio foi realizada sobre dois materiais, uma areia
argilosa e um agregado britado, utilizados na investigac?a?o de campo. O ??ndice
de vazios foi fixado para cada material tendo-se feito variar o teor em a?gua
de modo a reproduzir as condic?o?es de estado em campo. Os para?metros de
resiste?ncia e de rigidez foram determinados atrave?s de ensaios triaxiais. Foi
dado especial enfoque ao comportamento hidro–meca?nico no dom??nio das muito
pequenas e grandes deformac?o?es da areia argilosa devido a? fracc?a?o fina na?o
negligencia?vel. Os resultados obtidos mostram clara influe?ncia do teor em a?gua
no comportamento hidro–meca?nico de ambos os materiais, sendo essa influe?ncia
mais evidente na areia argilosa.

O estudo de campo compreendeu dois aterros experimentais, um aterro fer-
rovia?rio e um aterro rodovia?rio. Os mesmos materiais estudados em laborato?rio
foram utilizados no aterro ferrovia?rio. Procedeu-se a? construc?a?o de camadas
experimentais com diferentes espessuras (0.22, 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m) e difer-
entes teores em a?gua (2% do lado seco do o?ptimo, o?ptimo e 2% do lado hu?mido
do o?ptimo em relac?a?o ao Proctor Modificado) e a? avaliac?a?o das condic?o?es de
estado e do comportamento meca?nico para va?rios n??veis de energia. Especial
enfoque foi dado a? avaliac?a?o meca?nica atrave?s de ensaios pontuais e cont??nuos.
Os resultados mostraram grande influe?ncia do teor em a?gua, maior do que a in-
flue?cia da densidade, no comportamento meca?nico dos materiais o que reflecte o
efeito da succ?a?o nas propriedades meca?nicas. A comparac?a?o entre os resultados
de campo e de laborato?rio confirmou a consiste?ncia dos mesmos. Para ale?m
disso, concluiu-se que a avaliac?a?o meca?nica em cont??nuo por meio da utilizac?a?o
do Portanceme?tre representa um progresso significativo no controlo/garantia de
qualidade das camadas compactadas.

O aterro experimental rodovia?rio envolveu a utilizac?a?o de dois materiais,
cujo estudo laboratorial foi desenvolvido no a?mbito de outra tese doutoral. As
camadas experimentais foram constru??das com diferentes espessuras (0.30, 0.40
and 0.50 m), mas com teores em a?gua semelhantes e, assim como para o aterro
ferrovia?rio, as condic?o?es de estado e o comportamento meca?nico foram avaliados
para va?rios n??veis de energia. Para os teores em a?gua encontrados em campo
verificou-se que o teor em a?gua teve pouca influe?ncia no mo?dulo das camadas.
Pelo contra?rio, a densidade seca parece influenciar as propriedades meca?nicas,
desde que na?o se verifique uma grande variac?a?o do teor em a?gua. A comparac?a?o
dos resultados de campo com os de laborato?rio mostraram pequenas diferenc?as.
Na linha do conclu??do para o aterro experimental ferrovia?rio, estes resultados
assumem grande importa?ncia se se tiver em conta que o projecto tem por base
as propriedades meca?nicas dos materiais determinadas em laborato?rio.

Paralelamente a este estudo, no aterro rodovia?rio realizou-se um programa
experimental visando, por um lado, a monitorizac?a?o de vibrac?o?es em profun-
didade durante a aplicac?a?o de cargas de impacto e visando, por outro lado,
a monitorizac?a?o do rolo do cilindro procurando explorar a relac?a?o entre as
cargas aplicadas e as propriedades meca?nicas. Acelero?metros e extenso?metros
foram instalados em profundidade na camada de leito de pavimento permitindo
a medic?a?o da resposta dina?mica e das extenc?o?es totais. A resposta dina?mica em
profundidade reflecte um u?nico mo?dulo, apesar de diferentes mo?dulos obtidos
atrave?s dos ensaios dina?micos realizados a? superf??cie. Para ale?m disso, verificou-
se que o comportamento do rolo do cilindro e? sens??vel a? mudanc?a de rigidez do
material e que esta? relacionado com a resposta dina?mica em profundidade.

Palavras-chave: Condic?o?es de compactac?a?o, teor em a?gua, comportamento
meca?nico, mo?dulo, rigidez, resiste?ncia, estado na?o saturado, aterro experimen-
tal, resposta dina?mica e deformac?a?o em profundidade.

Introduction

1.1 Motivation

The structural behaviour of railways embankments and railtrack layers are
strongly influenced by compaction conditions. Usually railways embankments
and railtrack layers are constructed on compacted geomaterials that are typ-
ically in unsaturated condition during construction and may remain in that
condition during the working life of the structure. Several design and main-
tenance measures are undertaken to maintain unsaturated conditions because
they provide favorable engineering materials properties, namely shear strength
and deformability.

In practice, routine rail track design is based on rational methods using
Young modulus (E) and Poisson’s ratio (?). These parameters are generally
determined in terms of total stresses, even though materials used in railways
construction are not completely saturated or completely dry. This approach is
conservative to varying degrees to that the influence of soil suction is ignored,
although it plays a fundamental role on the hydro–mechanical behaviour. In
turn, the hydro–mechanical behaviour is influenced by compaction conditions.
To this end, the influence of compaction conditions on the hydro–mechanical
behaviour assumes great importance.

Traditionally, compaction control is carried out by means of different spot
check methods, used systematically or statistically, aimed at determining the
geomaterials state parameters (density and moisture content) or layers deforma-
bility (E modulus). Even though state parameters of geomaterials are not the
most desired engineering properties, it has used widespread for many years be-
cause it can be easily determined via weight and volume measurements. The
measurement of geomaterial density and moisture content allows the determi-
nation of relative compaction and moisture content deviation which are in fact
parameters used on compaction control. Although state parameters enable to
determine if adequate compaction has been achieved, it does not allow control-
ling the characteristic values normally considered in design. Therefore, it is
current to determine the E modulus, which is an important design parameter
for embankments, particularly, to transportation infrastructure. This property
is usually evaluated by means of static plate load tests (SPLT). However, the
current quality control/quality assurance (Qc/Qa) methods are time consuming,

1



2 Introduction

labor–intensive and costly. For instance, the determination of density with the
water balloon method takes about 45 minutes excluding the time for weighting
and drying the sample and the radiometric probe test takes about 5–15 minutes,
as a SPLT takes at least 30 minutes, besides the need of heavy equipment to
guarantee reaction force. The main reason for the adoption of such quality con-
trol methods is their relatively simplicity and can be applied to generate data
for a statistical evaluation of compaction quality (Lenke et al., 2003).

The strict requirements on quality construction of railway embankments,
namely, high–speed railways, demands higher quality compaction control. The
reduce construction time, the required high homogeneity of mechanical proper-
ties of compacted layers in order to avoid overcompaction and to minimize rel-
ative settlements of the embankment platform during serviceability conditions,
thus, seeking to minimize the exploration costs, are important aspects that dis-
tinguish this structures from conventional earthworks, like road embankments.

Recently, there is a strong trend towards using stiffness and strength to con-
trol compaction given the importance of these mechanistic properties in pave-
ment materials evaluation (Briaud, 2001; Loizos et al., 2003; Alshibli et al.,
2005; Edil and Sawangsurya, 2005). Mechanistic properties are a measure of
quality since non–uniformity of stiffness and/or strength is directly related to
progressive failures and life–cycle cost. Moreover, the design method of pave-
ments is based on engineering parameters of materials such as their stiffness
and/or strength, which results in a missing link between the design process and
construction quality control. As a result, the Qc/Qa procedures of construc-
tion should be based on a criterion that closely correlates to the performance
parameters used in the design.

Increasing demands for better, cheaper and faster compaction control have
lead to technology improvements. In this context, devices for field test eval-
uation of mechanical properties of geomaterials have been recently developed,
namely: impact tests (falling weight deflectometer – FWD and light falling
weight deflectometer – LFWD), the soil stiffness gauge (SSG) and Spectral
Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW). These are non–destructive spot tests meth-
ods which can be conducted independently and in conjunction with conventional
moisture content and density testing improving statistical evaluation and allow-
ing variability reduction, thus substantially enhance construction quality of the
entire earthwork. This notwithstanding, these new devices involves different
test methods which are not standardised and, therefore, it demands their in
situ evaluation.

Compaction is commonly carried out by vibrating rollers which vibration
frequency and amplitude is kept constant and the operator chooses the roller
speed. Compaction of a certain area is carried out by parallel strips (edge to edge
or with some overlapping) covering each strip with a fixed number of passes.
However, a certain number of passes and a constant roller speed, vibration
frequency and amplitude do not necessarily lead to a homogeneous compaction
result on a layer due to variation in material properties, water content of the
layer being compacted, and stiffness of the underlying layer. A constant number
of passes and constant roller parameters will often leave a certain part of the area
insufficiently compacted, another part over–compacted and the rest sufficiently
compacted (Briaud and Seo, 2004). Therefore neither proof rolling nor the
demand to compact until no further deformation behind the compacting drum
will ever be able to meet modern requirements on a homogeneous compaction

result (Thurner and Sandstro?m, 2000).

Though new spot test methods may represent an improvement on Qc/Qa,
spot test method can never reliably represent the compaction result of the entire
area. In addition, some of these test methods requires the delay or stop con-
struction work, because the tests have to be carried out without any disturbing
vibrations around the test spot. Regarding high quality projects as high speed
railways, where rigorous deformation criteria of the structure soil–railtrack must
be satisfied, continuous compaction control (CCC) approach represents a fairly
improvement. In this scope, in the early years equipments promoting CCC have
been developed, namely, Portanceme?tre (Quibel, 1999) and devices embarked
on the roller drum (Thurner and Sandstro?m, 1980; Adam, 1996; Thurner and
Sandstro?m, 2000; Anderegg, 2000; Anderegg and Kaufmann, 2004; Mooney and
Rinehart, 2007). Moreover, if a feedback control of one or more of the roller drum
vibration parameters (vibration frequency, force amplitude, and forward veloc-
ity) is employed, then compaction control could be done by compaction equip-
ment itself and optimization of compaction could be achieved independently of
equipment’s operator resulting, in that so called intelligent compaction.

However, the relationship between dynamic loads, namely those applied
by dynamic tests (LFWD, FWD and Portanceme?tre) and vibratory roller be-
haviour, and in situ dynamic response is not well understood. A better un-
derstanding of the in–ground dynamic behaviour of the soil in response to the
loadings imparted by these devices will aid in the development of CCC as well
as the refinement and acceptance of rapid spot test devices.

1.2 Objectives

The main objective of this research work is to investigate the influence of
compaction on the behaviour of railway embankments and consequently for
high quality road embankments. This is seeking through laboratory and field
investigations.

Field investigation consists on two full scale trial that have been performed
on a railway embankment and another trial has been carried out on a road em-
bankment. The execution of these trials was greatly conditioned by the impos-
sibility to fully perform the initially planned work, in the aim of a cooperation
protocol between the National Railway Network and and four national research
institutions (University of Minho, UM; National Laboratory of Civil Engineer-
ing, LNEC; New University of Lisbon, FCT/UNL; and Technical University of
Lisbon, IST) to develop the knowledge concerning the methodology for the con-
struction and control of the railway embankments and rail track layers for high
speed trains. This was established under the framework of a national research
project POCI/ECM/61114/2004, entitled “Interaction soil–rail track for high
speed trains”, financed by the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT).
In this protocol was planned:

- Execution of a trial embankment to establish a methodology of construc-
tion for optimization of embankments performance;

- Construction and observation of two definitive railway embankments, one
built according to traditional technologies of construction and control, and



4 Introduction

another built according with the new technologies of construction and con-
trol. During the construction of definitive embankments instrumentation
and monitoring during and post construction would be done. This would
allow comparison of performances from the two embankments, as well as
eventual comparison with numerical models developed in this context.

In the aim of this protocol it was only possible to perform the trial embank-
ment, which is called hereafter E?vora Trial Railway Embankment (ETRE).

However, another contract between the Centre for Waste Valorisation (CVR)
and Portuguese Steel Companies (SN), including University of Minho, allows to
obtain more knowledge about this subject also under the framework of another
National Research program founded by FCT. In fact, a trial road embankment
was constructed, giving the possibility to carry out different studies using spot
and continuous compaction control tests, as well as the instrumentation of the
embankment and road layers to measure vibrations and strains induced by the
compaction equipment and dynamic tests. Hereafter this trial embankment is
referred to as Fafe Trial Road Embankment (FTRE).

Field investigation aimed to study the influence of compaction conditions,
specifically, water content, compaction energy level and layers thicknesses on the
behaviour of compacted layers, particularly, mechanical behaviour. Attempting
to get a higher degree of homogeneity in what concerns to state parameters, the
water adding procedure employed on earth dams is used on both full scale trials.
Furthermore, focus is given to the establishment of a methodology for quality
control of compacted layers by using spot methods and continuous approach.
In this scope, new devices for field test evaluation of mechanical properties of
geomaterials, namely: LFWD, FWD, SSG, SASW and Portanceme?tre, will be
evaluated using SPLT as a reference test. Correlations between SPLT and per-
formance related tests are attempted. In addition, the evolution of modulus,
relative compaction and moisture content with the number of passes is investi-
gated in order to understand the influence of state conditions on the mechanical
performance of trial layers. Moreover, the homogeneity of either state param-
eters and mechanical properties will be evaluated for the last energy level and
compared with specifications given in literature. Finally, field tests results and
laboratory tests results will be compared attempting to establish a link between
design mechanical properties usually obtained from laboratory investigation and
actual in situ mechanical properties.

Concerning to ETRE, two geomaterials employed in railway embankment
and railway track layers were studied (clayey sand and crushed aggregate). In
addition to aforementioned, the SPLT was performed following two commonly
used standards (AFNOR NF P94–117–1 (2000) and DIN 18134 (2001)) with
the objective to develop a specification of the plate loading test to be used as a
reference method. This specification project will be then employed on FTRE.

With regards to FTRE, it is intended to study compaction conditions, specif-
ically, compaction energy level and layers thicknesses, of two geomaterials tradi-
tionally employed in road embankments (poor–graded silty sand and a crushed
aggregate) and another resulting from processed steel slag aggregates produced
in National Iron and Steel Company (inert steel aggregate for construction
– ISAC). In addition, on FTRE it is intended to investigate the in–ground
response of compacted geomaterials during field testing with SPLT, LFWD,
FWD, Portanceme?tre and vibrating roller drum. To this end, in–ground strain

gauges and accelerometers were installed in embankment layers to measure in–
situ static and dynamic response. Furthermore, the roller was outfitted with
accelerometers to monitor drum acceleration seeking to explore the relationship
between roller drum vibration characteristics and underlying soil properties,
namely soil stiffness.

The laboratory investigation aims to study the influence of compaction mold-
ing water content on the hydro–mechanical behaviour of two geomaterials (clayey
sand and a well graded gravel) employed on ETRE, reproducing in situ state
conditions. The laboratory investigation regarding material employed on FTRE
was performed in the scope of another doctoral thesis (Reis Ferreira, 2010).
Large strain domain will be investigated for both materials, where strength and
stiffness parameters will be determined through a multistage procedure and
compared to single stage procedure. Specimens will be compacted to the same
dry density and with different molding water contents, including the ones em-
ployed on field investigation, in order to study the influence of moisture content
on strength and stiffness. Focus will be given to clayey sand characterization.
Besides large strain tests, also investigation on the very small strain domain of
clayey sand will be carry out, where stiffness will be determined by means of seis-
mic wave measurements. A technique employing bender elements in conjunction
with accelerometers will be attempted aiming to evaluate the advantages of this
procedure on seismic measurements of high stiffness materials. Further, mod-
ulus degradation curves will be computed to verify if fits a reference threshold
for sands given in literature. In addition, hydro characterization (suction–water
content relationship) will be performed in order to highlight the influence of
unsaturated condition on the small and large strain mechanical behaviour.

1.3 Thesis layout

The work presented in this thesis has been divided in eight chapters. Follow-
ing this chapter, Chapter 2, entitled Compaction, presents a general overview
of compaction equipments and technologies and of compaction control. With
respect to former issue, focus is given to devices embarked on compactors and
intelligent compaction. Concerning the latter issue, specifications for high speed
embankments and rail track layers are addressed and new techniques on spot
tests method, namely SSG, FWD, LFWD and SASW, as well as continuous test
method by means of Portanceme?tre are highlighted.

Chapter 3, entitled The influence of compaction on the hydro–mecha–
nical behaviour of geomaterials, reviews basic concepts on unsaturated ge-
omaterials and describes the influence of compaction conditions on the hydro–
mechanical behaviour of either saturated and unsaturated geomaterials. It first
starts to present suction phenomena on unsaturated geomaterials and measuring
techniques focusing on filter paper method, which was employed in this research
work, and to present the soil water characteristic curve (SWCC), also known as
soil water retention curve (WRC), which empirically describes the relationship
between water content and suction. Then, stress state variables are addressed,
where the effective stress approach and independent state variable approach are
presented. Finally, the influence of compaction variables, namely, molding wa-
ter content, compaction energy and compaction method, on the WRC, stiffness,
compressibility and strength of either saturated and unsaturated materials are

reviewed.
Chapter 4, entitled Experimental program, presents the experimental

program adopted, which was developed in three parts, namely, a laboratory in-
vestigation and field investigation performed on a railway embankment and an-
other field investigation carried out in a road embankment. Laboratory investi-
gation involves physical, hydro and mechanical characterization of geomaterials
employed in field investigations. Laboratory tests are briefly described and tests
state conditions are summarized. The field investigation is divided accordingly
to the type and location of trial embankments: E?vora railway trial embankment
(ETRE) and Fafe road trial embankment (FTRE). The methodology adopted
in field investigations is described, namely, materials and experimental plan.
Furthermore, regarding FTRE, the instrumentation of an experimental section
with in–ground accelerometers and strain gauges, as well as the instrumentation
of a roller drum with two accelerometers is described.

Chapter 5, entitled Laboratory investigation, presents the results ob-
tained from physical, hydro and mechanical characterization of materials em-
ployed in field investigations. Main results are presented for the geomaterials
studied, yet focus is given to the results on the very small strains.

Chapter 6, entitled Field investigation: E?vora trial railway embank-
ment (ETRE), deals with the results obtained from in situ tests. Firstly, the
state conditions obtained from sand cone method (SCM) and nuclear method
(NM) on each trial layer are presented. Secondly, moduli obtained from SPLT,
LFWD, SSG, Portanceme?tre, FWD and SASW are presented. Concerning
SPLT, comparison between moduli obtained from SPLT using two measure-
ment devices is carried out. In addition, comparison between moduli obtained
from direct interpretation of SPLT following AFNOR NF P94–117–1 (2000) and
DIN 18134 (2001) standards is carried out, as well as, comparison between mod-
uli obtained from the interpretation of SPLT to the same stress and method.
Following results presentation, comparison between moduli obtained from dif-
ferent tests is carried out by material type. Then, analysis of the evolution of
modulus, relative compaction and moisture content with the number of passes is
presented and homogeneity of these parameters are evaluated for the last energy
level. Finally, field tests results and laboratory tests results are compared.

Chapter 7, entitled Field investigation: Fafe trial road embankment
(FTRE), presents the main results obtained from in situ tests. Similarly to pre-
vious chapter, the state conditions obtained from SCM, NM and rubber ballon
method (RBM) on each trial and embankment layers are presented. Secondly,
moduli obtained from SPLT, LFWD, SSG, Portanceme?tre, FWD and SASW are
presented, following comparison between moduli obtained from different tests is
carried out by material type. Then, analysis of the evolution of modulus, relative
compaction and moisture content with the number of passes is presented and
homogeneity of these parameters is evaluated for the last energy level. Further,
field tests results and laboratory tests results are compared. Finally, results
from monitoring of roller drum and in–ground vibrations during compaction
and application of dynamic loads from LFWD, FWD, Portanceme?tre and roller
drum are presented.

Chapter 8, entitled Conclusions, summarizes the main conclusions gathered
throughout this research work. The limitations and obstacles encountered in
this research are also revealed, which suggest room for further improvements
and developments.



Chapter 2

Compaction

2.1 Introduction

In soil mechanics soil compaction means the mechanical action that might
lead to a decrease of void ratio, mainly achieved by the volume reduction of the
gas phase. It is generally understood as a quick process, even sudden sometimes,
through which it seeks to introduce in the soil marked structural changes in order
to create a new type of storage of particles.

In general the performance of a soil, specifically their characteristics, shear
strength, deformability and permeability, depend on its void ratio. Thus, the
lower the void ratio, the greater is usually its shear strength and less are de-
formability and its permeability. Exception must be made, however, to “sensiv-
ity” materials, such as clay materials, to which this behaviour does not apply
(Guedes de Melo, 1985). Therefore, reducing the soil’s void ratio by compaction,
it is possible to improve its performance to future loadings. Compaction is,
therefore, a critical element in the construction of transportation infrastructure
(highways, railways, airports, etc.) and energy infrastructures (earth dams).

In what follows a brief review of compaction equipments and technologies
will be presented focusing on devices embarked on compacters and intelligent
compaction. Then, compaction control will be addressed and new techniques
on spot tests method, namely soil stiffness gauge (SSG), falling weight deflec-
tometer (FWD) and light falling weight deflectometer (LFWD), and spectral
analysis of surface waves (SASW), as well as continuous test method by means
of Portanceme?tre will be reviewed in detail.

2.2 Compaction equipments and technologies

Rollers are widely used for compacting soil, fill, and asphalt. The selection
of roller depends on characteristics of material to be compacted and machine
parameters. Material characteristics are related to layer thickness and material
properties like grain size distribution, maximum grain size and grain shape,
water content, water and air permeability. The machine parameters include
total roller weight and static drum load, static or dynamic compaction, and
the diameter and surface shape of the drum (smooth or sheepfoot). In case of

7



8 Compaction

dynamic compaction it must be considered the direction of resulting dynamic
contact force, excitation frequency and theoretical drum amplitude.

Traditionally, soil and rock fill materials are compacted with static or vi-
brating rollers. Rollers with static drums use the effective dead weight of the
machine to apply pressure on the surface. Thus, soil particles are pressed to-
gether and the void content is reduced. Adequate compaction with static rollers
is normally achieved only in the upper layers of the material, i.e., the effective
depth of static compaction is limited.

As reported by Adam and Kopf (2000), dynamic rollers make use of a vibrat-
ing or oscillating mechanism, which consists of one or more rotating eccentric
weights. During dynamic compaction, a combination of dynamic and static load
is used. The dynamically excited drum delivers a rapid succession of impacts to
the underlying surface where the particles are set in motion by the transmission
of compressive and shear waves. These vibrations eliminate periodically the
internal friction between particles and facilitate, in combination with the static
load, the rearrangement of the particles into positions that result in a lower
void ratio and a higher density. Furthermore, the increase in the number of
contact points and planes between the grains leads to higher stability, stiffness,
and lower long–term settlement behaviour. If dynamic load is applied vertically
or horizontally, rollers are denominated as vibratory or oscillatory, respectively.
However, by means of two counter–rotating exciting masses, there are roller
which enables the application of vertical, inclined and horizontal loads, as is
illustrated in Figure 2.1. That is the case of, for example, the VARIO roller
developed by BOMAG Company.

Figure 2.1: Adjustable excitation direction of a VARIO roller drum and com-
paction effect (Adam and Kopf, 2000)

More recently there has been an increasing interest in vibration–based mon-
itoring of roller compactors to provide continuous assessment of the soil mecha-
nistic properties, namely stiffness and/or modulus, during compaction process.
With this aim, devices are embarked on compactors and roller–based measures
of soil compaction are determined, e.g. relative indices or soil stiffness. If feed-
back control is employed on compactors, then so called intelligent compaction
is achieved.

2.2.1 Devices embarked on compactors

dependence of the soil response. A test roller had been equipped with triaxial
accelerometers, a mini roller behind the compacting roller was intended to reg-
ister vibrations passing from the large to the mini roller and triaxial geophones
were buried in the ground in order to measure ground vibrations, as shown in
Figure 2.2.

Figure 2.2: Test recordings of vibrations on the roller, a mini roller and geo-
phones (Thurner and Sandstro?m, 2000)

Simultaneous recordings from all sensors were analysed and it was found that
the accelerometer on the roller gave significant changes in the time history of
the sensor signal. The changes could be related to the increase of the stiffness
in the layer, documented by spot tests after each roller pass. The evaluation
of these tests led to the development of roller integrated compaction using the
roller drum as the measuring tool for instant and continuous compaction control
(Thurner and Sandstro?m, 2000). This was the starting point which led roller’s
constructors to propose devices embarked on compactors with the following
purposes:

- provide instantly and continuously relative information to the roller oper-
ator, enabling him to evaluate where compaction work is finished, where
additional passes are required and what sections cannot be sufficiently
compacted with the present roller;

- get an indication concerning the bearing capacity of a layer at the end of
compaction.

In 1978, Geodynamik developed and introduced the compaction meter and
the compaction meter value (CMV) and many of the roller manufacturers, e.g.,
Caterpillar, Ingersoll Rand, subsequently adopted the Geodynamik CMV–based
system. In the late 1980s, Bomag developed the Omega value and corresponding
Terrameter. The Omega value provided a continuous measure of compaction
energy. In the late 1990s, Bomag then developed a measurement value Evib
which provides a measure of dynamic soil modulus (Kro?ber and Floss, 2001).
Ammann followed suit with the development of a soil stiffness parameter ks
(Anderegg and Kaufmann, 2004).

In the following sections are explained the various roller–determined dy-
namic measurement values in use today, namely compaction meter value (CMV),
Omega value, roller–determined stiffness (ks) and vibration modulus (Evib).

Compaction Meter Value (CMV)

Compaction meter is a product of the Swedish company Geodynamic AB
and the first patent was taken out in 1978. Forssblad (1980) showed that var-
ious indices incorporating drum acceleration amplitude and the amplitude of



10 Compaction

its harmonics (i.e., multiples of the excitation frequency) could be correlated to
soil compaction and underlying stiffness. Adam (1996) showed that the force
amplitude “F” of the drum blows is proportional to the first harmonic of the
vertical acceleration, and the displacement “s” during the blow can be approx-
imated by the amplitude of the double integral of the fundamental acceleration
component of the drum.

In this aim, Thurner and Sandstro?m (1980) proposed the compaction meter
value (CMV) following Equation 2.1:

CMV = C ·
A2?
A?

(2.1)

where A? is the acceleration amplitude of the fundamental component of the
vibration; A2? is the acceleration amplitude of the first harmonic component
of the vibration, i.e., twice the eccentric excitation frequency (fig. 2.3); C is a
constant established during site calibration (C = 300 is often used).

Figure 2.3: Method to determine CMV involves spectral analysis (right) of two
cycles of vertical drum acceleration time history data (left) (Mooney and Adam,
2007)

It is known that the ratio of A2?/A? is a measure of nonlinearity (Ewins,
2000; Mooney et al., 2005). Concerning to roller–soil system if a roller with an
excitation frequency of 30 Hz produces a 30 Hz drum acceleration response, than
in a truly linear system the ratio A2?/A? would be equal to zero. Since the drum
acceleration response is distorted and not purely sinusoidal, therefore the roller–
soil system is nonlinear. The non linear behaviour of the roller–soil system can
be related to non linear elastic–plastic soil behaviour, to partial loss of contact
occurs between roller drum and soil and to contact surface varying nonlinearly
during each cycle of loading (Adam, 1996). Applying Fourier analysis it can
be reproduced a distorted waveform by summing multiples of the excitation
frequency. Therefore, the ratio A2?/A? is a measure of the degree of distortion
or nonlinearity.

Performing spectral analysis of the measured vertical drum acceleration over
two cycles of vibration allow CMV determination (fig. 2.3). The reported CMV
is the average of a number of two–cycle calculations. Geodynamik typically
averages the values over 0.5 sec; however, this can be modified to meet the
manufacturer needs. CMV precision is governed by 1% distortion resolution
of the accelerometer. Per Equation 2.1, 1% acceleration distortion equates to
CMV = 3 or ±1.5. Geodynamik reports less reliability for CMV below 8–10
(Mooney and Adam, 2007).



Compaction equipments and technologies 11

Former empirical investigations have revealed that the amount of the first
harmonic increases with increasing soil stiffness, which means that progress of
CMV is significantly influenced by the operating conditions (Adam and Kopf,
2000). Moreover, there is an auxiliary value that can be calculated in order to
take into consideration the operating conditions of the drum. This value is mea-
sured continuously and presented in a form of a signal called RMV (Resonance–
Meter–Value), which is defined by Equation 2.2:

RMV =
A0.5?
A?

(2.2)

where A0.5? is a subharmonic acceleration amplitude caused by jumping, i.e.,
the drum skips every other cycle.

The loading area from the cylindrical roller drum is a rectangular strip and
the size of this area depends on roller parameters like roller size, vibration am-
plitude and frequency, forward velocity, soil type and stratigraphy underlying
the soil being compacted. Thus the relationship between CMV and soil density,
stiffness and modulus is empirical and is influenced by these parameters (Sand-
stro?m and Pettersson, 2004; Mooney et al., 2005). Hence, it is obvious that
the actual CMV will vary from roller to roller and that the roller parameters,
especially the frequency, have to be kept constant and equal to the parameters
used during a calibration (Thurner and Sandstro?m, 2000). Therefore, the use of
CMV in continuous compaction control (CCC) requires careful calibration. The
associated relationships developed during calibration must be strictly adhered
to during subsequent site measurement (Mooney and Adam, 2007).

Several rollers manufactures, like Dynapac, Caterpillar and Ingersoll Rand
(via Geodynamik equipment) currently use CMV for roller monitoring. Sakai
recently introduced a Continuous Compaction Value (CCV) that, in addition
to the fundamental and first harmonic, considers the first subharmonic (0.5?)
and higher–order harmonics, following Equation 2.3 (Nohse and Kitano, 2002).

CCV =

[

A0.5? + A1.5? + A2.5? + A3?
A2.5? + A3?

]

× 100 (2.3)

Despite the fact that careful calibration should be done, using the roller
as the measuring tool has great advantages, such as complete coverage of the
area is obtained and that the result is received immediately. Figure 2.4 shows
the components of the compaction meter. An accelerometer is attached to the
bearing plate of the roller drum in vertical direction. The acceleration signal is
analysed in the processor and the result is presented on a dial or display as the
CMV.

Omega value

The Omega value is provided by Terrameter system which was developed by
Bomag and Kro?ber (1988). The drum is fitted with a detector unit with two
acceleration sensors arranged vertically which pick up the acceleration of the
drum. The CCC technique is based on the measure of the energy transmitted to
the soil (fig. 2.5). Considering the mass of the drum (md), the eccentric rotating
mass (me), the static force (Fstat) and the eccentric force (Fe), the measurement
of acceleration of the drum (z?d) and determination of drum velocity (z?d) by

the compaction result to the roller operator (Thurner and Sandstro?m, 2000)

integrating the acceleration components allows the determination of the Omega
value (eq. 2.4). This is determined by integrating the transmitted force Fs and
drum displacement zd time history over two consecutive cycles of vibration.

Figure 2.5: One–degree–of–freedom lumped parameter model representation of
vibratory compactor (Mooney and Adam, 2007)

In a electronic unit a computer stores the data transmitted by the detector
unit and provide to the roller operator in an analogue display the Omega value,
while compaction process is in progress. Omega values may range from 0 to
1000, depending on status of compaction or stiffness and, for a certain measuring
distance, can be viewed after each pass in a line or bar chart. The measuring
system also provides information to roller operator whether further effective
compaction passes are possible or not by means of two control lights on the
control unit. For this purpose, the mean Omega value of a forward (reverse)
pass is compared with the value of the previous forward (reverse) pass. The
end of effective compaction work is indicated by a red control light which lights
up when falling below a determined difference in values (Floss and Kloubert,
2000).

The Omega value is influenced by machine specific parameters, which are
amplitude, frequency and working speed, as well as by soil specific parameters
including those that describe stiffness, i.e., the strength and deformation char-
acteristics, namely grain size distribution, plasticity, water content and density.



Compaction equipments and technologies 13

The influence of subsoil should be considered for layers with less than 1.50 me-
ters (Floss and Kloubert, 2000).

Soil stiffness ks

In the late 1990s, Ammann introduced a roller–determined soil stiffness
parameter, ks (Anderegg, 1998). A dynamic soil compactor produces nonlin-
ear oscillations whose characteristics may be described analytically (Anderegg,
2000). Accordingly to several authors, Yoo and Selig (1979), Pietzsch and Poppy
(1992), Adam (1996), Anderegg and Kaufmann (2004) and Anderegg et al.
(2006), among others, the vertical kinematics of the soil–drum–frame system
can be represented as a lumped parameter model, as illustrated in Figure 2.6.

Figure 2.6: Analytical model of vertical vibration of a single drum roller (circular
excitation) (Anderegg et al., 2006)

The vibration roller can be subdivided into the frame and the drum. The
frame, with mass mf , consists of the engine, the cabin and the drive which
is supported in the drum via elastic suspension elements with stiffness, kf ,
and damping constant, cf . Together with the rubber elements represents a
second order lowpass with a natural frequency of 3 to 4 Hz, which dampens
excitation frequencies. The drum, with mass, md, contains an eccentric rotating
unbalanced mass, me, which generates the drum vibrations together with the
soil at frequency, f. In analytical terms, the steady–state dynamic behaviour of
the soil–machine system is defined as in Equations 2.5 and 2.6 (Anderegg and
Kaufmann, 2004), where the soil is represented with a Kelvin–Voigt spring–
viscous dashpot model.

Fs = ?mdz?d + mere?
2cos(?t) + kt(zd ? zf ) + ct(z?f ? z?d) + mfg

0 = ?mf z?f + kt(zd ? zf ) + ct(z?f ? z?d) + mfg
(2.5)

Fs = kszd + csz? if Fs ? 0
Fs = 0 else

(2.6)

The dot notation signifies the differentiation with respect to time and md
is drum mass (kg), f is frequency of excitation (Hz), mf is frame mass (kg),



14 Compaction

? is circular vibration frequency (Hz), mere is eccentric moment of unbalanced
mass (kg.m), zd is displacement of drum, ks is soil stiffness (MN/m), zf is
displacement of frame, cs is soil damping (MN.s/m), kt is suspension stiffness
(MN/m), ct is suspension damping (MN.s/m), t is time, and g is gravitational
acceleration (9.81 m.s?2).

Anderegg and Kaufmann (2004) proposed an approach wherein the soil stiff-
ness is solved for at the point where the drum is in its down–most position
(where zd = 0). This approach reduces the problem to a single variable and al-
lows for a real time solution for ks. It also assumes that any effect on the drum
due to the frame inertia is negligible. Mooney and Rinehart (2007) states that
while this assumption is satisfactory for single drum rollers where the ratio of
the drum mass to the frame mass is typically between 1.5 and 2, it is less valid
for tandem rollers, where the ratio of the drum mass to the frame mass can be
lower. The equation for the soil–drum interaction force (Fs) become defined as
Equation in 2.7.

Fs = ?mdz?d + mere?
2cos(?t) + kt(zd ? zf ) + mfg (2.7)

The drum inertia force and eccentric force time histories can be determined
via measurement of drum acceleration and phase angle ?, i.e., eccentric position.
The drum displacement amplitude zd is determined via spectral decomposition
and integration of the measured peak drum accelerations (Anderegg and Kauf-
mann, 2004). The resulting Fs versus zd response is graphically illustrated
in Figure 2.7 for continuous contact and partial uplift behaviour. Solving the
equation of motion for ks when the drum velocity is zero yields Equation 2.8.

Figure 2.7: Illustration of ks during contact (left) and partial loss of contact
behavior (right) (Mooney and Adam, 2007)

With this approach, the damping, cs, is eliminated from the calculation, and
a quasi–static stiffness, ks, independent of the exciting frequency, is obtained.
Investigations performed by Anderegg and Kaufmann (2004) with a tandem
roller vibrating on compacted subgrade with a constant static unbalanced mass,
mere, and a variable excitation frequency f from 25 to 50 Hz, showed that the
associated stiffness, ks, is independent of frequency in that frequency range (fig.
2.8). For highest frequencies the system started to become dependent on the
machine dynamics, and the measured stiffness values were higher than the static
ones because of the wave propagation effects.

Kaufmann, 2004)

Evib modulus

Evib modulus is the more recent Bomag measurement value (Kro?ber and
Floss, 2001). The principle is identical to the one described above for ks. A
lumped parameter vibration and cylinder on elastic half–space theory is used on
its determination. The drum/soil assembly is modeled as shown previously in
Figure 2.5. Similarly to Ammann technology, Bomag employs two accelerom-
eters to measure vertical drum acceleration (frame inertia is neglected) which
enables to compute drum displacement. Phase angle (?) is calculated and en-
ables the determination of the contact force Fs per equilibrium of forces. The
combination of Fs and zd data yield contact force–drum deflection curves from
which secant stiffness can be extracted, as illustrated in Figure 2.9.

Figure 2.9: Contact force–drum displacement behaviour (Mooney and Adam,
2007)

The relationship between the measured stiffness and vibration modulus Evib,
can be established through the application of Hertz and Lundberg’s theoretical
solutions for a rigid cylinder resting on a homogeneous, isotropic elastic half–
space (Lundberg, 1939). Investigations made by Hertz in 1895 and further
developments by Lundberg in 1939 gave the relationship between the load on a
roller and the imprint area created by the roller. Lundberg’s theory is a static
solution and relates zd, Fs, drum length L and diameter R to Poisson’s ratio ?
and Young’s modulus E of the half–space as shown in Equation 2.9.

The relationship between the stiffness ks and the modulus, E, can also be
established on an experimental basis by performing the roller tests and plate
tests in parallel. Ammann reports on a study from ETH Zurich in Switzerland
which was conducted to establish such a relationship (Preisig et al., 2003). Fig-
ure 2.10 shows a relationship between the stiffness ks obtained from the roller
and the moduli ME1 and ME2 from the first load and reload of the plate test.
The figure shows a reasonable relationship with some scatter.

Figure 2.10: Stiffness (kB = ks) vs. Modulus (Preisig et al., 2003)

Comparison between CMV, Omega value, ks and Evib

Through numerical simulations of roller–soil behavior using finite element
analysis of a roller vibrating on an elastic half-space Adam and Kopf (2004)
explored the influence of soil Youngs modulus on roller measurement values (E
modulus in Figure 2.11). The y–axis in Figure 2.11 depicts the relative drum
vibration amplitude, i.e., the ratio of zd to the theoretical maximum zd(max)
given by the ratio between eccentric static moment (mere) and mass of the drum
(md). In addition, zones corresponding to the drum operation under different
conditions depending on roller and soil parameters are delimited (Adam, 1996).
Five operating conditions specified in Figure 2.12 can occur; definition criteria
are the contact condition between drum and soil and the drum motion cycle as
a multiple of the excitation cycle.

In Figure 2.11 one can see how relative amplitude and soil modulus influences
the behaviour of roller drum during compaction (contact modes). Focusing on
continuous contact and partial uplift modes, CMV is very low and constant
when the drum is operating in contact mode, regardless of soil modulus. CMV
increases as soil modulus increases during partial uplift, thus is sensitive to soil
stiffness. However, CMV at a constant soil modulus is amplitude dependent;
therefore, a higher eccentric force will yield a greater CMV for the same soil.
The amplitude dependence of CMV is more pronounced for softer soils than for
stiffer soils. The Omega value was found to be much less sensitive to underlying
soil stiffness for constant amplitudes and strongly amplitude dependent.

Parameter ks was found to increase with soil modulus and is amplitude
dependent during partial uplift. It decreases with increasing amplitude during



Compaction equipments and technologies 17

ative drum vibration amplitude–results of numerical simulations (Adam and
Kopf, 2004)

partial uplift, particularly for stiffer soil. The amplitude–dependence of soil
stiffness was also demonstrated in field testing by Mooney and Rinehart (2007).
Similarly to ks, Evib is sensitive to changes in soil modulus during continuous
contact and partial uplift modes. An increase in soil modulus leads to an increase
in Evib. Though Evib exhibits little or no amplitude dependence in continuous
contact mode, amplitude dependence increases with increasing amplitude during
partial uplift. This amplitude dependence is more pronounced for stiffer soil.

From Figure 2.11 one may conclude that all parameters exhibit amplitude de-
pendence at a constant soil modulus. Mooney and Rinehart (2007) investigated
the various roller parameters that determine the soil stiffness, namely drum ac-
celeration and phase lag, as well as the influence of underlying heterogeneity on
roller measured soil stiffness. The investigators found that roller determined soil
stiffness was strongly dependent on vibration amplitude, and that underlying
heterogeneity (e.g., near surface bedrock) presents a significant challenge to the
interpretation of data from roller–integrated measurement systems.

2.2.2 Intelligent compaction

As seen in previous section, compaction control could be included in the
compaction process through devices embarked on the rollers enabling continu-
ous monitoring and identification of soil properties, i.e. continuous compaction

control (CCC). If, in addition, a feedback control of one or more of the fol-
lowing: vibration frequency, force amplitude, and forward velocity is employed,
then compaction control could be done by compaction equipment itself and
optimization of compaction could be achieved independently of equipment’s op-
erator. This is the basis of intelligent compaction.

Anderegg and Kaufmann (2004) describes the technical conditions required
for intelligent compaction, which are shown in Figure 2.13. The vibration be-
havior of the drum-soil system is measured by using vertically fitted acceleration
sensors; the phase lag between the excitation and the displacement of the drum
is obtained from the measurement of the point when the exciter unit passes 0
and the point when the measured and doubly integrated acceleration passes 0,
that is, the amplitude signal. The roller speed is also measured.

These data are forwarded to the electronic device, where the required vari-
ables (e.g., phase angle, soil force, and soil stiffness) are calculated, and the
commands to the final controlling elements (differential gear box and hydraulic
vibration pump) are generated. When the instructions are executed, the control
loop is closed, and the compactor becomes a closed feedback control system that
is completely observable and completely controllable. In addition, the control
system has an operating panel and a display that shows the machine operator
the compaction achieved and the optimum roller speed.

The limit of reasonable use of a vibratory roller is imposed by the nonlinearity
behaviour of the drum vibration, which is caused by periodic loss of contact
from the soil with the inception of bouncing and rocking. Since nonlinearity
is controlled by force, the concept control system is based on restriction of a
maximum force. The maximum soil reaction force is controlled to a value that
guarantees the smooth entry of power into the soil, depending on the compaction
material and the layer thickness. In addition, an analysis of the state of motion
ensures that no subharmonic vibrations occur. Expressed in analytical terms,
the machine parameters are controlled according to (Anderegg and Kaufmann,
2004):



Compaction equipments and technologies 19

mann, 2004)

Fs max = setpoint value (Fs max as per Equation 2.7);

(iii) if subharmonic vibrations occur, mere is reduced immediately;

(iv) the roller speed is optimal if the impact space is between 2 and 4 cm.

However, roller–measured soil stiffness has been found to vary with exci-
tation force amplitude and frequency (Adam, 1996; Anderegg and Kaufmann,
2004; Mooney and Rinehart, 2007). This behaviour is particularly pertinent
regarding intelligent compaction since these parameters are continuously varied
in an attempt to promote faster and more uniform compaction. To advance the
understanding and capabilities of CCC in vertically homogeneous and layered
earth structures as well as the measurement of soil properties during intelligent
compaction, the relationship between roller–measured soil stiffness and in situ
stress–strain response was explored and characterized by Mooney and Rinehart
(2009) and Rinehart and Mooney (2009).

Stress and strain sensors were placed at multiple depths within both ver-
tically homogeneous (clayey sand) and heterogeneous (crushed rock over silt)
test beds. Triaxial stress–strain behavior was captured during static and vibra-
tory passes of two commercially available intelligent compactors over a range of
typical excitation force frequencies and amplitudes.

Mooney and Rinehart (2009) found roller–measured stiffness to decrease
with increasing vibrating force for tests on the vertically homogeneous clayey



20 Compaction

sand. This behaviour was attributed to the stress–dependent modulus reduc-
tion observed in situ. On the crushed rock over silt layered test bed, roller–
measured stiffness increased with increasing vibrating force despite the mild
stress–dependent modulus reduction observed in the crushed rock. Authors ar-
gues that the ratio of vertical stress in the crushed rock to vertical stress in
the underlying silt increased with vibrating force indicate that the crushed rock
toked on a greater portion of the load. Because the crushed rock was 4-5 times
stiffer than the underlying silt, the composite roller–measured stiffness increases
accordingly.

The investigations carried out by Rinehart and Mooney (2009) showed that
measured vertical stresses with depth matched well with those estimated using
Hertzian cylinder contact theory applied to a homogeneous, linear elastic half
space. One unique aspect of curved–drum loading was that the contact area
changes as a function of applied force and stiffness of the soil. The contact
width was found to strongly influence the resulting vertical stress profiles.

Further, both investigations showed that cyclic strains induced by drum vi-
bration were only 15-25% of those induced by static loading. Authors pointed
out this aspect because roller based stiffness measures are based on cyclic drum
deformation and the cyclic portion of strain is a reflection of the drum defor-
mation used in the roller–based stiffness calculation. These small magnitudes
were attributed to curved drum interaction with the soil and to viscoelasticity.
During vibration, the drum/soil contact force equals the static force a cyclic
force that is a function of vibrating force and drum inertia. Contact stress and
contact area are non linearly related to force and vertical drum deflection, and
lead to a hardening type relationship between applied force and drum deflection
as depicted in Figure 2.14. The deflections (and in turn strains) due to drum
vibration are smaller than the deflections resulting from static loading.

To sum up, roller–measured stiffness and its dependence on vibrating force
was found to be influenced by the stress–dependent modulus function of each
soil, the varying drum/soil contact area, and by layer characteristics modulus
ratio, thickness when layering is present. The interplay between these and
other factors (e.g., dynamics, rate dependent response) will dictate the nature of
roller–measured stiffness dependence on vibrating force (Mooney and Rinehart,
2009).

2.3 Compaction control

The increasing requirements on quality construction in order to avoid over-
compaction and to minimize relative settlements of the embankment platform,
as well as to minimize the exploration costs, demands higher quality on soil
compaction control. It is meant by compaction control the group of operations
taken over compacted layers with the purpose of guarantee that the character-
istics assumed in project are being achieved in construction.

In project are considered several parameters values, such as, unit weight,
shear strength, deformability and permeability. The compaction control should
focus on the distributions of values exhibited by each of these parameters. But
happens that the direct and individual control of these parameters requires
a lot of work and is time consuming, which is incompatible with the rhythm
of construction. Therefore, the control is in general done by an indirect way,



Compaction control 21

Figure 2.14: Hardening response induced by the curved drum (Rinehart and
Mooney, 2009)

through the control of certain characteristics that assure the compaction quality
of embankments.

As already mentioned compaction of soil increases its density and produces
three important effects: (1) increase in the soil’s shear strength, (2) decrease in
future settlement of the soil, and (3) decrease in soil’s permeability. Thus, soil
density is one of the indirect parameters which allow the embankments quality
control. Even though soil density is not the most desired engineering property,
traditionally it is used by the transportation industry to specify, estimate, mea-
sure, and control soil compaction. This practice was adopted many years ago
because soil density can be easily determined via weight and volume measure-
ments. The most common methods used for density measurement are sand cone
replacement, water balloon and nuclear method.

The measurement of material density allows the determination of relative
compaction which is in fact the parameter used on compaction control. In first
place, optimum water content and the maximum dry unit weight (?max lab) are
determined in the laboratory by either the standard or modified Proctor test.
Then, target values are defined for compacted field dry unit weight (?d field).
Relative compaction (RC) can be expressed as ?d field/?max lab. In most specifi-
cations for earthwork, the contractor is required to achieve a relative compaction
of 90 to 95%.

Although referred compaction control parameters permits to determine if
adequate compaction has been achieved, it does not allow controlling all the
characteristic values normally considered in project. Therefore, it is current to
determine the E modulus, which is an important design parameter for embank-
ments projected, for example, to transportation infrastructure, namely high
speed railways.

Further, high quality compaction involves not only a high degree but also a
high uniformity of compaction. Experience and long–term monitoring have dis-
closed that the mechanical behaviour, serviceability index and lifetime of a road
or railway depend widely on the compaction degree and homogeneity/uniformity
of the multi–layered railway structure. The interactions were investigated in-
tensively already 35 to 30 years ago and resulted in detailed recommendations



22 Compaction

(Brandl, 1977), including variation coefficient moduli from plate load tests (one
test for ? 200 m2) and for density measurements (replacement method – one
test for ? 300 m2, nuclear method – one test for ? 150 m2).

To sum up, traditionally, compaction is controlled by means of different
spot test methods, used systematically or statistically, aimed at determining
the materials density or the E modulus of the layers in different spots. These
current quality control/quality assurance (Qc/Qa) methods are time consuming,
labor–intensive and costly. For instance, the determination of density with the
water balloon method takes about 45 minutes excluding the time for weighing
and drying the sample and the radiometric probe test takes about 5 to 15
minutes, as a plate loading test takes at least 30 minutes, besides the need of
heavy equipment to guarantee reaction force. The main reason for the adoption
of such quality control methods is their relatively simplicity and can be applied
to generate data for a statistical evaluation of compaction quality (Lenke et al.,
2003).

Recently, there is a strong trend towards using stiffness and strength to con-
trol compaction given the importance of these mechanistic properties in pave-
ment materials evaluation (Briaud, 2001; Loizos et al., 2003; Alshibli et al.,
2005; Edil and Sawangsurya, 2005; Gomes Correia et al., 2009a). Mechanis-
tic properties are a measure of quality since non–uniformity of stiffness and/or
strength is directly related to progressive failures and life–cycle cost. Moreover,
the design method of pavements is based on engineering parameters of materials
such as their stiffness and/or strength, which results in a missing link between
the design process and construction quality control. As a result, the Qc/Qa
procedures of construction should be based on a criterion that closely correlates
to the performance parameters used in the design.

Increasing demands for better, cheaper and faster compaction control have
lead to technology improvements. In this context, equipments for field test eval-
uation of mechanical properties of geomaterials have been recently developed,
such as, impact tests (Falling Weight Deflectometer – FWD and Light Falling
Weight Deflectometer – LFWD), the Soil Stiffness Gauge (SSG), Spectral Anal-
ysis of Surface Waves (SASW). These are non–destructive spot tests which can
be conducted independently and in conjunction with conventional moisture den-
sity testing improving statistical evaluation and allowing variability reduction,
thus substantially enhance construction quality of the entire earthwork (Edil
and Sawangsurya, 2005). Further, equipments enabling continuous evaluation
of mechanical properties like Portanceme?tre had been developed, which repre-
sents a great improvement on compaction control. However, these equipments
are not normalized and its use demands calibration to reference test given in
compaction control specifications (Gomes Correia et al., 2009a). In this scope,
in the following section are addressed specifications adopted by countries where
high speed railways have been constructed. Further, the aforementioned devices
were used in the aim of the present thesis and, therefore, a detail review of each
one will be addressed.

2.3.1 Specifications for high speed embankments and rail
track layers

There are several aspects that governs high–speed railway embankments and
distinguishes from other conventional transportation infrastructure, like road



Compaction control 23

embankments. High–speed railway embankments demands an infrastructure
exhibiting an overall stiffness that limits maximum settlements and minimize
relative settlements of the embankment platform during serviceability conditions
(Martins et al., 2009), in order to minimize the exploration costs, to avoid high
level of discomfort for passengers and reduce induced vibrations on surrounding
structures.

These aspects include strict requirements demands of high quality construc-
tion of embankment and railtrack layers regarding material quality, state param-
eters and mechanical properties limits, promoting homogeneity of mechanical
behaviour of compacted layers. Requirements increase from bottom to top lay-
ers. The embankment layers should provide a stable foundation for the base
(subballast) and ballast layers. The range of stiffness of the capping layers is
believed to influence ballast, rail and sleeper deterioration, since the influence
of the traffic induced stresses extends downwards as much as 5 meters below the
bottom of the sleepers. Hence, embankment layers are a very important sub-
structure component which as a significant influence on track performance and
maintenance. Base layer (subballast) assumes great importance due to several
aspects, e.g., to ensure better distribution of loads, to protect the underlying
layer against erosion, to avoid seepage into the underlying layer and to prevent
the penetration of fine soil material into the track bed, especially to the ballast.

In the scope of the present work focus is given to requirements regarding
compaction control, namely, relative compaction and mechanical properties of
compacted layers. In Table 2.1 is summarized the requirements regarding com-
paction control of embankment and railtrack layers in France and Taiwan, given
by UIC (2004) and THSRP (2003), respectively.

Mechanical properties requirements are similar for all type of layers, whereas
specifications only differ on requirements regarding relative compaction. More-
over, it is noteworthy that standards for determination of parameters also differ.
Nevertheless, determination of relative compaction is straightforward, while E
modulus determination following different standards yield differences either in
the procedure and on the interpretation of test results. Accordingly to informa-
tion from National Railway Network (REFER), UIC (2004) is followed regarding
compaction control of new high–speed railway lines. This code specifies SPLT
performance following French standard AFNOR NF P94–117–1 (2000) and Ger-
man standard DIN 18134 (2001) as reference test for determination of EV2. In
this scope, a better insight on these standards will aid on understanding the
major aspects that distinguish them.

2.3.2 Static plate loading test (SPLT)

The SPLT has been used for quality control of pavement structure layers for
many years in many European countries. This test method allows the determi-
nation of the relationship between load and settlement (load–settlement curve),
the aim being to assess the deformation and strength characteristics of soil and
to determine the strain modulus.

The test consists of loading a circular plate on the top of the layer to be tested
and measuring deflections under load increments. The load is transmitted to the
plates by a hydraulic jack, acting against heavy mobile equipment as a reaction
force, while the corresponding deflection is measured. French standard AFNOR
NF P94–117–1 (2000) and German standard DIN 18134 (2001) are commonly
used to perform SPLT.

AFNOR NF P94–117–1 (2000)

The test consists in the application, after a pre–load, of two successive load-
ing cycles on a plate with normalized stiffness and diameter. For a 600 mm
diameter plate, the first load cycle should correspond to a 0.25 MPa stress un-
der the plate and this stress maintained till the plate’s settlement stabilization.
Following, the load is release at once. In the second load cycle it should be
reach a stress under the plate of 0.20 MPa. The load release should be done
only after the plate’s settlement stabilization, as the first load cycle (fig. 2.15a).
The modulus, EV2, is calculated to the second loading cycle using Boussinesq
solution and secant method as in Equation 2.10.

For measuring the settlement of the loading plate two different systems can
be used. The first consists in a contact arm assembly which measures the
settlement of the center of loading plate. The second consists on the settlement
measuring of three concentric points on periphery of the loading plate distanced

of 120? (fig. 2.15b). For both systems, the supports of the measuring devices
shall be positioned so stands located 1.5 m from the center of the loading plate.

DIN 18134 (2001)

To determine modulus, EV2, the load shall be applied in not less than six
stages, in approximately equal increments, until the required maximum normal
stress is reached. Each increase in load (from stage to stage) shall be completed
within one minute. The load shall be released in stages, to 50% and 25% of
the maximum load and then to the load corresponding to the zero reading.
Following that, a further (2nd) loading cycle shall be carried out, in which the
load is increased only to the penultimate stage of the first cycle (fig. 2.16a).

A 300, 600 or 762 mm loading plate can be used. To determine the modulus
for design calculations the load shall be increased until a settlement of 5, 8 or
13 mm, or a normal stress below the plate of 0.50, 0.25 or 0.20 MPa, respectively,
is reached. If the required settlement is reached first, the normal stress measured
at this stage shall be taken as maximum stress. In the present work, it was used
a plate with 300 mm diameter. The strain modulus, EV2, is calculated to the
second loading cycle using the tangent method as in Equation 2.11.

EV2 =
1.5 · r

a1 + a2 · ?0 max
(2.11)

where r is the radius, ?0 max is the maximum average normal stress below the
plate and a1 and a2 are factors of the smooth load settlement curve correspond-
ing to the second load cycle.

For measuring the settlement of the loading plate a contact arm assembly
shall be used and supports shall be located 1.5 m from the center of the loading
plate (fig. 2.16b).

2.3.3 New techniques on spot tests method (SSG, FWD,
LFWD, SASW)

Soil Stiffness Gauge (SSG)

The SSG is manufactured by Humboldt Manufacturing Company and is a
field hand portable instrument that nondestructively measures soil stiffness and
soil modulus in a simple and rapid way (fig. 2.17). It is intended for the
evaluation of compacted subgrade, subbase and base course layers, including
treated materials, for use in roadways and embankments.

(a) (b)

Figure 2.17: Humboldt Stiffness Gauge: (a) general aspect; (b) detail of ring
shaped foot

The equipment weighs approximately 10 kg. It has a compact size of 28 cm
in diameter by 25.4 cm in height. The device rests on the soil surface via a ring–
shaped foot, which has an outside diameter of 114 mm and an inside diameter
of 89 mm (fig. 2.17). The foot bears directly on the soil and supports the weight
of the SSG via several rubber isolators.

A mechanical shaker, which is attached to the foot, excites the footing in
the vertical mode from 100 to 196 Hz in 4 Hz increments, producing 25 different
frequencies and generating a force of 9 N. The SSG has sensors that measure
the force, F , and the velocity, V , of the foot (see fig. 2.18). The magnitude
of the vertical displacement induced at the soil–ring interface is typically less
than 1.27×10?6 m, which is measured using velocity sensors. A microprocessor
computes the stiffness k (the layer’s resistance to deflection) for each of the 25
frequencies, and the average value of the 25 measurements is displayed along
with a standard variation.

The force applied by the shaker and transferred to the ground is measured by
differential displacement across the internal flexible plate as in Equation 2.12.
At the frequencies of operation, the ground–input impedance will be dominantly
stiffness controlled (Eq. 2.13). Thus, the ground stiffness is given by Equation
2.14

where Fdr is the force applied by the shaker; Kflex is the stiffness of the flexible

components attached to the rigid foot and of the foot; Kgr is the stiffness of the
ground, n is the number of test frequencies used in the SSG; V2 is the velocity
at the flexible plate; V1 is the velocity at the rigid foot.

This approach avoids the need for a non–moving reference for ground dis-
placement and permits the accurate measurement of small displacements. The
measured soil stiffness from the SSG can, in turn, be used to calculate the soil
modulus of the underlying bound or unbound soil media. The applied force (F)
and correspondent defection (?) are related with the outside radius of the ring–
shaped foot (r), Young’s modulus (E) and Poisson’s ratio of the tested material
through as in Equation 2.15 (Poulos and Davis, 1974).

F =
1.77 · r · E

(1 ? ?2)

Considering that material’s stiffness is given by Equation 2.16, the SSG
stiffness k can then be converted to the soil elastic modulus ESSG using the
Equation 2.17:

k =

(2.16)

ESSG =
k · (1 ? ?2)

(2.17)

These equations assume that the underlying soil is linear elastic, homoge-
neous, and isotropic. They also assume an infinite half space. The assumptions



28 Compaction

of homogeneity, isotropy, and elasticity are frequently invoked in soil mechanics
and pavement design when analyzing soil layers. However, the assumption of
an infinite half space is arguably violated when one considers that underlying
pavement layers are generally of finite depth (on the order of 20 cm) and are
of increasing modulus with depth. Hence, any computation of elastic modu-
lus from the SSG measured stiffness must be carefully evaluated (Lenke et al.,
2001).

The response is dominated by the stiffness of the underlying soil. The manu-
facturer specifies a range of stiffness measurement capability from 3 to 70 MN/m,
which means an elastic modulus from 25 to 600 MPa. A depth of measurement
on the order of twice the foot outside diameter is produced (i.e., 23 cm).

In order to ensure good seating, Humboldt suggests that 60 percent of the
SSG footprint be clearly visible after removing the SSG following a test on
natural material. In the case of very rough surfaces, a moist fine sand layer may
be placed as a coupling between the SSG foot and the soil.

Alshibli et al. (2005) conducted a laboratory evaluation on different soil types
using both SSG and SPLT where values for the latter ranged from approximately
0 to 500 MPa. Equation 2.18 describes the regression model obtained.

Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD)

Falling weight deflectometers (FWDs) have been in use since the 1980s.
These devices are used to measure pavement deflections in response to a sta-
tionary dynamic load corresponding to the effect of loading due to standard axle
on in–service pavement.

There are several FWD manufacturers and, thereby, characteristics may
slightly vary. In the scope of this thesis a Dynatest Model 8000E device was
used. The FWD is mounted on a trailer (fig. 2.19a), that can be towed by
most conventional vehicles, where is mounted a load generating and a deflection
measurement system. The control/recording system is housed in the towing
vehicle.

The load generating system consists of a drop weight mounted on a vertical
shaft, which is usually dropped onto a 305 mm or a 450 mm diameter loading
plate. Both plates were used in the aim of the present work. The drop weight
is hydraulically lifted to predetermined heights ranging from 50 to 510 mm and
the applied load ranges from 7 kN to 120 kN depending on the magnitude of the
dropping mass and the height of the drop. The impact of the falling weight
is capable of producing impact loads approximately halfsinusoidal wave, and a
loading time between 25 and 40 ms applies impulse loading to a circular plate.
This is in contact with the pavement surface through a 5.6 mm thick rubber
buffer (fig. 2.19b), which is usually used to improve the uniformity of load-
ing stress distribution over the whole loading plate area. The applied load is
recorded by a load cell.

The deflection measuring system consists of 8 geophones positioned on the
pavements/layer surface at fixed distances from the center of the loading plate
(fig. 2.19b). These geophones register the velocities due to an applied load and
deflections are computed by the software.



Compaction control 29

(a) (b)

The FWD is used to establish elastic modulus values for the pavement layers.
The principle of the test is the measurement of the deflection bowl produced by
dropping a weight onto the pavement.

The analysis of FWD results can be carried out in several ways. Back–
calculation procedure is widely employed for analyzing deflection data from
FWD (Lee, 1988). The analysis involves establishing a set of moduli values
which would produce deflections to match the displacements recorded. These
theoretical deflections are compared with measured deflections and the assumed
moduli are then adjusted in an iterative procedure until there is no significant
difference between the theoretically calculated and the measured deflections.
The moduli determined in this method represent the pavement response to load
and can be used to calculate stresses or strains in the pavement structure. An-
other way consists on the interpretation of the results through spectral analysis
of surface waves (Aouad et al., 2007). Then, a static approach can also be used
on the interpretation of FWD results. The measured center deflection of the
plate is combined with the applied load to calculate the stiffness using conven-
tional Boussinesq static analysis. This data is used to estimate the dynamic
deformation modulus, EFWD, following Equation 2.19.

EFWD =
kplate · (1 ? ?

2) · ? · r

?c
(2.19)

where kplate = ?/2 or 2 for rigid and flexible plates, respectively; ?c is center
deflection of the plate; ? is the applied stress; and r is the radius of the plate.

The FWD provides periodic non–destructive evaluation of the structural
capacity of different pavement sections. Due to its speed, better simulation of
traffic loading, and results that can directly be applied in structural design,
it has been a good non–destructive test for pavement structure assessment.
Althougth, less experience has been gained with the use of the FWD on road
bases, subbases and subgrades (Gurp et al., 2000; Abu-Farsakh et al., 2003).
Current FWD research, suggests that it can be used in quality control during
construction of pavement layers (Zaghloul and Saeed, 1996; Rogers et al., 2000).
Nevertheless, it faces with some problems, such as tilting of the deflection sensors
caused by uneven surface, which in excess of a certain value leads to inaccurate
deflection measurements that can not be used in back calculation (Gurp et al.,
2000).

Light Falling Weight Deflectometer (LFWD)

The LFWD is a portable device used to determine the soil’s dynamic modu-
lus, ELFWD. It consists of a loading device that produces a defined load pulse, a
loading plate and at least one geophone sensor to measure the deflection of the
center of the plate. The LFWD dynamic modulus (ELFWD) is then calculated
from the load pulse and deflection.

The equipment used in this study was a Prima 100 LFWD manufactured
by Carl Bro Pavement Consultants. It weighs approximately 26 kg and has a
10 kg falling mass that drops on the bearing plate via four rubber buffers. The
center geophone sensor measures the deflection caused by the mass impact on
the loading plate. During the test, the falling mass impacts the plate, producing
a load pulse in the range of 1–15 kN in about 15–20ms. The diameter of the
loading plate used in this study was 300 mm. Alternatively 100 and 200 mm
plates are also available.

(a) (b)

Figure 2.20: (a) LFWD; (b) Components of the LFWD (Adam and Adam,
2003)

During testing with PRIMA 100, the load is applied to the layer surface via
the circular plate. The resulting force and velocity time histories are measured
and the corresponding displacement time history is automatically obtained by
means of integration (internal to the device) of the velocity record. The equip-
ment is connected to a computer equipped with software for recording, data
interpretation and visualization. The output includes respective time histories
and peak values of the applied load, F(t), and ensuing deflection, ?(t), as well
as an estimated value of ELFWD. A typical plot of the force and deflection time
histories data generated by PRIMA 100 is presented in Figure 2.21. Similarly
to FWD, the same static approach can be used and Equation 2.19 is employed
to the determination of ELFWD.

Fleming et al. (2007) point out one particularly important aspect when con-
sidering the measurements made is the interpretation of the deflection under
load. In general the device software integrates the geophone (velocity trans-
ducer) signal to determine the maximum (or peak) deflection value. This has



Compaction control 31

Figure 2.21: LFWD data collection screen

two important ramifications, the first being that under test the peak deflec-
tion may not occur at the same instant as the peak load, specifically for lower
stiffness materials. The second is that the maximum deflection may include an
element of permanent/plastic deflection in addition to recoverable/elastic de-
flection. This depends upon the “strength” of the materials under test, and
the efficacy of the contact between the geophone foot and the material under
test. Thus it is apparent that the term “elastic” stiffness should be applied very
carefully to this device, and the use of such “elastic” values in elastic pavement
analysis needs careful consideration. In their investigations they found signifi-
cant permanent deflection in loose and partly compacted sand, but no plastic
deformation was observed at compacted state.

Several studies have been recently conducted to evaluate LFWD measure-
ments. The SPLT test is standardised and has been used for many years as a
useful in situ test to evaluate the strength/stiffness of pavement, thus is consid-
ered as a reference test.

Alshibli et al. (2005) tested different types of soils with LFWD and SPLT in
a laboratory setting to evaluate their relation, where values of the latter ranged
approximately from 0 to 700 MPa. The relation given in Equation 2.20 was
obtained between EFWD and modulus from the reloading cycle of the SPLT
test, EPLT(R).

EPLT(R) = 25.25 · e
0.006EFWD (R2 = 0.90) (2.20)

Fortunato (2005) performed 36 in situ tests with LFWD (300 mm diameter)
and SPLT (600 mm diameter plate) during a geotechnical site investigation work
on the platform of the old railway of the Portugal North railway line. These
were carried out on different materials. The equipment and standards used were
similar to those used in this study. The SPLT values of EV2 ranged from 36
to 148 MPa, and relationships between moduli obtained by the two tests were
established (Eqs. 2.21 or 2.22).

Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW)

SASW is a widely used method for in situ testing that have been proposed
and developed during the 1980s (Heisey et al., 1982; Nazarian, 1984; Stokoe
et al., 1988). It is a seismic method that use the propagation of elastic waves
through materials at low deformation level, in the range of 10?5. At this defor-
mation level it is possible to relate deformations and mechanic characteristics
of materials using the theory of elasticity in linear system. The shear modulus
obtained with these methods are considered as maximum values, G0.

There are two categories of seismic wave: volumetric waves and surface waves
(fig. 2.22). Volumetric waves are of two types: P–waves and S–waves. P–waves,
also known as primary, compressional or longitudinal waves, involve successive
compression and rarefaction of the materials through which they pass, i. e.,
particle moves in the direction of wave propagation (fig. 2.22a). This type of
waves can travel through solids and fluids. S–waves, also known as secondary,
shear or transverse waves, cause shear deformations as they travel through a
material, i. e., particle moves in a plane perpendicular to the direction of wave
propagation. The direction of particle movement can be used to divide S–waves
into two components. SV–waves whose particle motion lies in a vertical plane,
and SH–waves whose particle motion occurs only in a horizontal plane. A given
S–wave with arbitrary particle motion can be represented as the vector sum of
its SV and SH components. This type of wave can not travel through fluids
since they have no shearing stiffness.

(a) (b)

(c) (d)

Figure 2.22: (a) P–waves; (b) Rayleigh waves; (c) S–waves; (d) Love Waves

Surface waves results from the interaction between volumetric waves with
surface and superficial layers, being created Rayleigh waves and Love waves,
which propagation occurs at surface. Rayleigh waves, produced by interaction
of P and SV–waves with the surface, involve both vertical and horizontal par-
ticle motion, which can be assimilated to water waves occurring in the surface.
Particle movement describes ellipses in a vertical plane, where the vertical axle
is about one and a half the horizontal axle, which contains the propagation wave
direction, with displacement contrary to the propagation wave in the highest
point of the ellipses (fig. 2.22b). Love waves result from the interaction of SH–
waves with a soft superficial layer than underlying half-space. Particles move
horizontally and transversally to direction of propagation (fig. 2.22d).



Compaction control 33

The basis of the SASW technique is the dispersive property of Rayleigh–type
surface waves when propagating in a layered system. Dispersion refers to the
variation of Rayleigh wave phase velocity with wavelength (or frequency). Dis-
persion arises because Rayleigh waves of different wavelengths sample different
depths in a material profile as illustrated schematically in Figure 2.23. As wave-
length increases, particle motion extends to greater depths in the profile. The
velocities of Rayleigh waves, or surface waves, are representative of the material
stiffness over depths where there is significant particle motion. For example,
the particle motion of a wave that has a wavelength less than the thickness of
the top layer is confined to this layer (fig. 2.23). Therefore, the wave velocity is
influenced only by the stiffness of the top layer. The velocity of a wave with a
wavelength that is longer than the thickness of the top layer, but shorter than
the combined thicknesses of the top two layers, is influenced by the properties of
only the upper two layers because essentially all motion occurs in these layers.
Thus, by using surface waves with a range of wavelengths, it is possible to assess
material properties over a range of depths.

Figure 2.23: Approximate distribution of vertical particle motions with depth
of two surface waves of different wavelengths (Rix and Stokoe, 1989)

SASW testing can be synthesised in three different steps that lead to the final
result of a stiffness profile for the site: field testing, dispersion curve evaluation
and inversion process.

Field testing consists of making field measurements of surface wave phase
velocity, VR, at numerous wavelengths, ?R. To ensure the adequate application
of SASW test it is necessary to take into account the energy source and receivers,
considering the desirable frequency range, the space between receivers and the
range of exciting frequency for each space adopted.

The energy source that generates surface waves is, normally, mechanical (im-
pact) or electromechanical (continuous) sources that apply dynamical vertical
loads to the surface. The impact sources correspond to loads generated by an
impulse, as the ones proportioned by hand hammers or weights that falls from
a determined high. Normally, as heavy is the impact source, the lower is the
generated frequency. However, the same source does not generate the same fre-
quencies in every medium. There are other factors which controls the generated
frequency domain, namely the stiffness of the material and the interface between



34 Compaction

the source and material to analyse. In general terms, for characterization of su-
perficial layers is used a light hand hammer, being used a heavy one when higher
depth is of interest. Regarding continuous sources, electromechanical ones are
generally used producing sinusoidal vibrations with a range of frequencies. This
allows to control vibration frequency and to set a range of frequencies. Another
way to obtain continuous signs is to operate heavy equipment near receivers.
The signs produced are random and normally has a sign-to-noise ratio rela-
tively low. At sites where there are no surface area limitations, the primary
consideration in selecting an energy source is the required depth of profiling.
Deep profiling requires a high–energy, low–frequency wave source, while shallow
profiling can be done with a low–energy, high–frequency wave source.

In general, the receivers used in this tests are geophones (velocity transduc-
ers) and accelerometers (acceleration transducers), of low frequency and high
sensibility, since induced displacements are usually small. The receivers are
placed in vertical and aligned relative to energy source. The selection of type
of receiver and its spacing depends mostly of the frequency domain used on the
test. In order to minimize the effects of proximity of the source, mainly related
to body waves and aliasing phenomenon in spectral analysis it is necessary to
impose limitations to the distance between energy source and receivers, L, and
receivers spacing, d. Tokimatsu et al. (1991) proposed the positioning of the
receivers in such a way that:

The general field configuration of the source, receivers, and recording equip-
ment typically used when testing with two receivers is shown in Figure 2.24.
The propagation of waves along the surface is monitored with the two receivers
placed at distances of d1 and d2 from the source. Additionally, distance d2 is
usually kept equal to two times d1. Typical receiver spacings for deep profiling
are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 m. These spacings allow evaluation of most soil profiles
to a depth of 50 to 70 m.

a two–channel recording system (Stokoe et al., 1994)



Compaction control 35

After the field data are recorded, a dispersion curve is calculated. For test-
ing with multiple receivers, receiver pairs are used to determine the dispersion
curve. For each receiver pair, the time histories recorded by the two receivers
are transformed to the frequency domain, and the cross power spectrum and
coherence function are calculated. It should be noted that all of these frequency
domain quantities are calculated in real time by the waveform analyzer. The
key data consist of the phase of the cross power spectrum and the coherence
function. The coherence function represents a signal–to–noise ratio and is often
close to one in the range of acceptable data. The time delay between receivers
as a function of frequency, t(f), is calculated from the phase of the cross power
spectrum. The surface wave velocity, VR, is calculated using Equation 2.25.
The corresponding wavelength of the surface wave, ?R, with a given frequency,
f, is calculated by Equation 2.26.

(2.26)

The result of these calculations is a dispersion curve (VR versus ?R) for
each receiver pair. For the traditional two–channel SASW testing illustrated
in Figure 2.24, individual dispersion curves from a group of receiver spacings
are assembled together to form the composite dispersion curve for the site. An
example of a composite dispersion curve is presented in Figure 2.25 using eight
different receiver spacings as noted in the figure. In the scope of the present work
experimental dispersion curve was computed using software SPICE developed
in KU Leuven (Schevenels and Geert Degrande, 2009).

ical dispersion curves for a soil site Stokoe et al. (1994)

After a dispersion curve is calculated from the field data, forward modeling
is used in the laboratory to evaluate the shear wave velocity profile. Forward
modeling is the process of calculating the shear wave velocity profile by a trial–
and–error matching of a theoretical dispersion curve with the measured field
dispersion curve. In this process, the theoretical dispersion curve is calculated



36 Compaction

for an assumed velocity profile. This velocity profile should contain a sufficiently
large number of sublayers to define the variation of material properties at the
site. The shear wave velocities and thicknesses of the sublayers in the assumed
profile are adjusted by trial and error until a satisfactory match between the
theoretical and field dispersion curves is obtained. Such a match is illustrated
in Figure 2.25b for the smoothened composite dispersion curve developed from
the data shown in Figure 2.25a. The resulting shear wave velocity profile is
shown in Figure 2.26, along with results from crosshole tests also performed at
the site (Stokoe et al., 1994).

Figure 2.26: Shear wave velocity profiles determined from SASW (using data
shown in fig. 2.25) and crosshole tests at the same site Stokoe et al. (1994)

According to the theory of elasticity, the relationship between the velocity
of shear waves, Vs, and the velocity of Rayleigh waves, VR, in a uniform is given
by Equation 2.27.

Vs ? C · VR (2.27)

The constant C is dependent on the Poisson’s ratio. For values of this
coefficient of 0.2 and 0.5, C assumes values of 1.09 and 1.05, respectively, which
means that the error in evaluating the Poisson’s ratio little affect the value of
Vs. The value of the shear modulus, G, is determined from values measured
of velocity of Rayleigh waves and the density of material, ?, by the theory of
elasticity, given by Equation 2.28. This way it is possible to convert the vertical
profile of velocities in a profile of values of shear modulus.

G = ? · V 2s (2.28)

2.3.4 Continuous test method (Portanceme?tre)

Hitherto, compaction control has been carried out mainly by means of spot
test methods with the purpose to check the density, stiffness or modulus of the
compacted layer. Compaction result is checked by means of some spot test
method can never reliably represent the compaction result of the entire area,
nor contribute to an improvement of the homogeneity of the compaction work.
According to national compaction standards in different countries one sample
is taken on 2.000 m3 of compacted soil, which means a relation between sample



Compaction control 37

volume and compacted volume of 1:1.000.000. Such quality control relation
probably is very hard to find elsewhere (Thurner and Sandstro?m, 2000).

Most of spot test methods are time consuming and will in addition delay or
stop construction work, because the tests have to be carried out without any
disturbing vibrations around the test spot. Moreover, traditionally, soil and
rock fill materials are compacted with static or vibrating rollers. As mentioned
before, compaction parameters of the roller are chosen by operator and kept
constant, which do not necessarily lead to a homogeneous compaction result
on a layer. Therefore compaction control by mean of spot test methods will
ever be able to meet modern requirements on a homogeneous compaction result
(Thurner and Sandstro?m, 2000).

Regarding high quality projects as high speed railways, where rigorous de-
formation criteria of the structure soil–railtrack must be satisfied, continuous
compaction control represents an improvement fairly to compaction control by
mean of spot test methods. As has been noted in section 2.2.1, CCC may be
achieved by instrumented rollers. However, there is an equipment named, Por-
tanceme?tre, which operates similarly to instrumented rollers. This equipment
performs continuous compaction control by measuring bearing capacity through
an instrumented vibrating wheel.

The Portanceme?tre is an equipment developed by the “Center d’E?tudes Tech-
niques de l’E?quipment” (CETE) in France. It measures the bearing capacity of
a platform continuously while rolling to a constant speed. The device consists
on a narrow vibrating wheel with suitable characteristics towed by a 4x4 vehicle
(fig. 2.27). This wheel is set into vibration by way of an eccentric mass activated
by a hydraulic engine.

The principle of measure is based on the determination of the curve: force
communicated by the vibrating wheel versus deflection, allowing the determi-
nation of stiffness of geomaterials and to calculate its modulus. This equipment
applies a load, at a 35 Hz frequency, to the soil trough a vibration wheel while
rolling to a speed of 1 m/s. The instrumentation installed on the equipment
permits to measure the vertical component of acceleration of the vibration and
suspended masses, and the vibration frequency and the phase angle between the
vibration vertical amplitude and the centrifugal force applied to the wheel (fig.
2.27c). An algorithm associated calculates the vertical force applied to the soil
and the corresponding deflection.

The vertical component of the applied force by the vibration wheel (FTA)
is calculated by the following expression (Quibel, 1999):

FTA = M1 · g + M0 · ?V 1 + (M1 ? M0) · ?V 2 + me · ?
2 · cos? (2.29)

where M1 · g is the total weight; M0 · ?V 1 is the inertial force of the vibrating
mass with ?V 1 being the vertical acceleration measured by means of a single
axial accelerometer; (M1 ? M0) · ?V 2 is the inertial force of the frame with
?V 2 being the vertical acceleration of the suspended mass; me · ?

2 · cos? is the
vertical component of the centrifugal force produced by the eccentric mass.

The vertical movement of the vibration wheel is determined by a double
integration of the signal of the vertical acceleration. The average of the measured
values, of the force and deflection, in thirty successive periods, permits to get the

force–deflection curve of which the upward part is treated by linear regression in
the zone 30% to 90% of the vertical maximum force (FTA) applied to determine
the stiffness. With a vibration frequency 35 Hz and a travelling speed 1 m/s, the
Portanceme?tre device provides a value of modulus for each meter length (fig.
2.28).

The traveling speed of the whole is measured by means of ultrasonic radar
Doppler that also allows to determine the covered distance and therefore to
situate the measure in the longitudinal profile.

Some conditions must be guaranteed to allow the application of Portanceme?-
tre. Relatively to the layer geometry, the measurements are valid when longi-
tudinal and transversal inclinations are lower than 7 and 5%, respectively. In
respect to mechanical properties, loose materials with low shear strength on
surface must be considered out of the domain of the equipment. This situation
is verified when observed a rut let by the passage of the vibrating wheel with
more than 2 cm.

Several tests performed with Portanceme?tre on structures constructed with
different materials (aggregates, soils and treated materials), enabling a varia-
tion of the EV2 modulus, determined by means of the static plate test (600 mm
diameter), from 20 to 500 MPa, showed a very good correlation between mea-
sures of stiffness with the Portanceme?tre and values of modulus determined by
dynaplaque 2 or by the classic test (EV2) (Quibel, 1999):

E = 5 · k (2.30)

E being expressed in MPa and k in kN/mm.

Other experimental results (Quibel, 1999) allow the application domain of
the Portanceme?tre device to be composed by bottom of cuttings, layers and
upper parts of embankments and sub-grades, with elastic modulus in the range
of 30 to 300 MPa. The material thickness taken in account was about 0.60 m.

Fortunato (2005) conducted two series of SPLT (600 mm diameter plate)
tests, one of 22 tests and another of 11 tests, and Portanceme?tre passages on
a sub–ballast layer and comparison between moduli was established. From
first series the author reported that modulus from 14 SPLT tests differed less
than 25% from modulus obtained from Portanceme?tre. Regading second series,
average difference between moduli was found to be 9% with a maximum relative
difference not exceeding 27%.

2.4 Summary

Compaction has a major influence on mechanical behaviour of compacted
geomaterials. Compaction leads to a decrease of void ratio, which, in turn,
improves their performance regarding shear strength, deformability and per-
meability. Hence, compaction assumes a critical role in the construction of
transportation infrastructure (highways, railways, airports, etc.) and energy
infrastructures (earth dams).

In general, geomaterials are compacted with static or vibrating rollers. Re-
cently there has been an increasing interest in vibration–based monitoring of
roller compactors to provide continuous assessment of the soil mechanistic prop-
erties, namely stiffness and/or modulus, during compaction process. With this
aim, devices are embarked on compactors and roller–based measures of soil com-
paction are determined, e.g. relative indices or soil stiffness. As so, instantly and
continuously relative information allows the roller operator to evaluate where
compaction work is finished, where additional passes are required and what
sections cannot be sufficiently compacted with the present roller and, on the
other hand, allows to get an indication concerning the bearing capacity of a
layer at the end of compaction. In this scope, the various roller–determined dy-
namic measurement values in use today, namely compactor meter value (CMV),
Omega value, roller–determined stiffness (ks) and vibration modulus (Evib) were
presented.

If feedback control is employed on compactors, then so called intelligent com-
paction is achieved. Intelligent compaction technology results from the combi-
nation of the absolute measurement technology with a control system that uses
the measured information to continuously adapt major control parameters of a
vibratory roller, namely, the amplitude, the frequency and the roller velocity,
to the required conditions.

The increasing requirements on quality construction in order to avoid over-



40 Compaction

compaction and to minimize relative settlements of the embankment platform,
as well as to minimize the exploration costs, demands higher quality on soil
compaction control.

Recently, there is a strong trend towards using stiffness and strength to con-
trol compaction given the importance of these mechanistic properties in pave-
ment materials evaluation (Briaud, 2001; Loizos et al., 2003; Alshibli et al.,
2005; Edil and Sawangsurya, 2005). Mechanistic properties are a measure of
quality since non–uniformity of stiffness and/or strength is directly related to
progressive failures and life–cycle cost. Moreover, the design method of pave-
ments is based on engineering parameters of materials such as their stiffness
and/or strength, which results in a missing link between the design process and
construction quality control.

Increasing demands for better, cheaper and faster compaction control have
lead to technology improvements. In this context, equipments for field test eval-
uation of mechanical properties of geomaterials have been recently developed,
such as, impact tests (Falling Weight Deflectometer – FWD and Light Falling
Weight Deflectometer – LFWD), the Soil Stiffness Gauge (SSG), Spectral Anal-
ysis of Surface Waves (SASW). These are non–destructive spot tests which can
be conducted independently and in conjunction with conventional moisture den-
sity testing improving statistical evaluation and allowing variability reduction,
thus substantially enhance construction quality of the entire earthwork (Edil
and Sawangsurya, 2005). These equipments were used in the aim of the present
thesis and, therefore, a detail review of each one was addressed in this chapter.
Further, equipments enabling continuous evaluation of mechanical properties
like Portanceme?tre had been developed and was also used in the present study.
Thus, a detail review was also presented.



Chapter 3

The influence of compaction
on the hydro–mechanical
behaviour of geomaterials

3.1 Introduction

Compacted geomaterials find their most important applications in geotech-
nical civil engineering projects. Examples can be found in earth dams and
transportation projects, such as road, railways and airport embankments.

Railways embankments and railtrack layers are constructed on compacted
geomaterials that are typically in unsaturated condition during construction and
may remain in that condition during the working life of the structure. Several
design and maintenance measures are undertaken to maintain unsaturated con-
ditions because they provide favorable engineering materials properties, namely
shear strength and deformability.

In practice, pavement design is based on rational methods using Young mod-
ulus (E) and Poisson’s ratio (?). These parameters are generally determined in
terms of total stresses, even though materials used in railways construction are
not completely saturated or completely dry. This approach is conservative to
varying degrees to that the influence of soil suction is ignored. For this reason,
the behaviour of unsaturated materials is of utmost importance.

The mechanical aspects of saturated geomaterials are governed by the Terza-
ghi’s effective stress. When a soil mass is loaded, it deforms and then a counter
force is generated so as to balance the load. Although soil consists of a soil
skeleton and pore fluid, the latter does not play a principal role in the shear
behaviour, that is, the pore fluid does not resist the shear force. The pore water
migrates within the soil skeleton subjected to hydraulic boundary conditions.
However, on unsaturated geomaterials the pore space is occupied by both air
and water, where suction play a fundamental role on the hydro–mechanical as-
pects. Unsaturated soil behaviour consists of hydraulic part dealing with the
suction-saturation relation and a mechanical part dealing with the stress-strain
relation. In turn, the hydro–mechanical behaviour is influenced by compaction
conditions.

42 The influence of compaction on the hydro–mechanical behaviour

In what follows basic concepts on unsaturated geomaterials will be pre-
sented. Then, the influence of compaction conditions on the hydro–mechanical
behaviour of either saturated and unsaturated geomaterials will be addressed.

3.2 Basic concepts of non saturated geomateri-
als

3.2.1 Suction

Soil suction is defined as the potential difference between the soil pore water
and water outside the soil pores, per volume of water and is also referred to as
free energy state of soil water (Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993). The free energy of
the soil water can be measured in terms of the partial vapor pressure of the soil
water (Richards, 1965) and its thermodynamic relationship can be expressed in
terms of relative humidity as follows:

? = ?
R · T

m · g
· ln

(

P

P0

)

(3.1)

where ? is soil suction or total suction, R is the universal gas constant, T is the
absolute temperature, g is the gravitational constant, P/P0 is relative humidity
in percent where P is the partial pressure of pore water vapor pressure (kPa)
and P0 is the saturation pressure of water vapor over a flat surface of pure water
at the same temperature (kPa).

The total suction (free energy) of soil is divided into two components, osmotic
and matric suction. Osmotic component is defined as “the equivalent suction
derived from the measurement of the partial pressure of the water vapor in
equilibrium with a solution identical in composition with the soil water, relative
to the partial pressure of water vapor in equilibrium with free pure water”
(Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993). In other words, the osmotic component of soil
suction arises from the chemical interactions between dissolved salts and free
water (defined as water containing no dissolved solutes).

The second component of soil suction is the matric suction. It is defined as
“the equivalent suction derived from the measurement of the partial pressure of
the water vapor in equilibrium with the soil water, relative to the partial pressure
of the water vapor in equilibrium with a solution identical in composition with
the soil water” (Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993). In unsaturated soil mechanics
matric suction is defined as the difference between the pore air pressure and
pore water pressure (µa ? µw). This component is commonly associated with
capillary phenomena arising from surface tension of water, which results from
intermolecular forces acting on molecules in the contractile skin.

Capillary phenomena is best understood through the classic example of water
rising and remaining above the line of atmospheric pressure within a small
diameter tube. The surface of the water in the capillary tube is curved and is
called a meniscus, as illustrated in Figure 3.1. The height of capillary rise is
a function of the tube diameter, contact angle between the tube and wetting
liquid. The mathematical relationship is shown below:

hc =
2 · T

? · r
· cos? (3.2)



Basic concepts of non saturated geomaterials 43

where T is the surface tension of the fluid (water for this discussion), r is the
radius of the capillary tube, ? is the unit weight of water, and ? is the contact
angle between the water and capillary tube. Assuming a clean glass tube and
pure water (contact angle ? becomes 0), equation 3.2 reduces to the following:

hc =
2 · T

? · r
(3.3)

Figure 3.1: Physical model and phenomenon related to capillarity (Fredlund
and Rahardjo, 1993)

Setting the hydrostatic equilibrium in the capillary system shown in Figure
3.1, matric suction can be deduced and expressed as follows:

(µa ? µw) =
2 · T

r
· cos(?) (3.4)

From Figure 3.2 it can be seen that soil particles similar to the walls of the
capillary tube and the surface tension contractile skin (air–water interface) holds
both the water intact and the two soil particles together. Considering that the
geomaterials pores with small radii act as capillary tubes, Equation 3.3 shows
that the smaller the pore radius in the soil, the higher will be matric suction
and, therefore, shear strength of unsaturated geomaterials will increase.

In most engineering problems it is primarily the matric suction component
which largely governs the behaviour of unsaturated soils (such as mechanical
problems) in the lower suction range encountered in most field situations (Vana-
palli et al., 1996).

Several measurement techniques are available to measure the suction of a
soil sample. A comprehensive description of the experimental techniques com-
monly used for measuring or controlling soil suctions can be found in Fredlund
and Rahardjo (1993). The method selected should depend upon the suction
desired. Measurement techniques, such as tensiometers (Delage et al., 2008),
psychrometers (Delage et al., 2008), pressure plates (Richards, 1941), and filter
paper method (Chandler et al., 1992; Marinho and Oliveira, 2006), are used



44 The influence of compaction on the hydro–mechanical behaviour

Figure 3.2: Capillary tubes showing the air–water interfaces at different radii of
curvature (Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993)

covering a wide range of suction measurement. Only filter paper method will
be described, since it was the only method employed in the aim of this research.

This method was selected because it is capable of measuring a wide range
of matric suctions (i.e., from 10 kPa to 10 MPa), it is relatively simple and
cost efficient method, and it has been widely used in geotechnical engineering
practice (Chandler et al., 1992; Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993; Likos and Lu,
2002; Marinho and Oliveira, 2006; Bicalho et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2008)

The filter paper method operates on the premise of determining suction of
unsaturated soils indirectly by measuring the amount of moisture transferred
from soil mass to dry filter papers. It calculates the soil suction indirectly from
previous calibration. Basically, the filter paper comes to equilibrium with the
soil either through vapour (total suction measurement) or liquid (matric suction
measurement) flow. At equilibrium, the filter paper and the soil will have the
same suction value. After equilibrium is established between the filter paper
and the soil, the gravimetric water content of the filter paper disc is measured.
The gravimetric water content of filter paper is then converted to suction using
a calibration curve for the type of paper used.

Two filter paper methods exist depending upon if the total or matric suction
is to be determined. If total soil suction is desired the non–contact method
should be used, while the contact method allows determination of matric suc-
tion. Figure 3.3 illustrates the testing setups for total and matric suction mea-
surement. In the contact filter paper technique, water content of an initially
dry filter paper increases due to a flow of water in liquid form from the soil to
the filter paper until both come into equilibrium. Therefore, a good contact be-
tween the filter paper and the soil has to be established. The contact filter paper
method becomes inaccurate in high matric suction range since water transport
is dominated by vapour transport.

The water content measure is correlated to a calibration curve unique for
the filter paper used, and the suction, matric or total, is able to be determined
depending upon the calibration curve selected. In the present work ash–less
filter papers Whatman 42 was used. In Table 3.1 are listed some published

3.2.2 Soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) / Water re-
tention curve (WRC)

As it was seen on the previous section, behaviour of unsaturated soils depends
on the magnitude of suction, which in turn is influenced by soil water content
for a given soil. The relationship between water content and suction can be
empirically described by the soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) (Fredlund
and Rahardjo, 1993; Tinjum et al., 1997; Vanapalli et al., 1999; Marinho and
Stuermer, 2000; Bardanis and Kavvadas, 2008), also known as soil water reten-
tion curve (WRC) (Karube and Kawai, 2001; Aubertin et al., 2003; Nuth and
Lalouia, 2008), which is defined as the water storage capacity of a soil at a given
soil suction. The water content variable can be a gravimetric water content, w,
or a volumetric water content, ?, or degree of saturation, S. A typical WRC is
illustrated in Figure 3.4.



46 The influence of compaction on the hydro–mechanical behaviour

Figure 3.4: Typical WRC (Vanapalli et al., 1996)

The graph consists of two curves: (i) a drying curve and (ii) a wetting curve.
The hysteric nature of the curve is due to the complex nature of soil pore
structure and can be attributed to the size differences between the primary
pores and the interconnecting pore throats, changes in the contact angle during
drying and wetting, and trapped air (Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993; Tinjum
et al., 1997).

Vanapalli et al. (1999) described the several key features of WRC. One pa-
rameter of interest is the air–entry value (Sair). Conceptually, the air–entry
value represents the differential pressure between the air and water that is re-
quired to cause desaturation of the largest pores, i.e., the matric suction value
needed to cause water to be drawn from the largest pore space within the soil
(Brooks and Corey, 1966; Vanapalli et al., 1999). Further the author identi-
fies several stages of desaturation (see fig. 3.5), namely: the boundary effect
stage, the transition stage (i.e., primary and secondary), and the residual stage
of unsaturation.

In the boundary effect stage, almost all of the soil pores are filled with
water (i.e., the water menisci in contact with the soil particles or aggregates
are continuous in this stage). Under these conditions, the single stress state,
(? ? µw), describes the behaviour of the soil. The soil desaturates at the air–
entry suction value in the transition stage. In this stage, the flow of water is in
the liquid phase as the applied suction increases and the soil dries rapidly with
increasing suction. The connectivity of the water in the voids or pores continues
to reduce with increased values of suction, and eventually large increases in
suction lead to relatively small changes in the degree of saturation. The residual
state of saturation is considered to be the degree of saturation at which the liquid
phase becomes discontinuous. Consequently, the residual state of saturation
represents the degree of saturation value beyond which it becomes increasingly
difficult to remove water from a specimen by drainage. The point at which
residual state of saturation is reached is not always clearly defined.

Gupta et al. (2007) summaries influencing factors on the WRC. The distin-
guishing features of the WRC depend on several factors such as soil structure
(and aggregation), compaction conditions (i.e., compaction water content, com-



Basic concepts of non saturated geomaterials 47

Figure 3.5: Probable variation of water area in different stages of a WRC (Vana-
palli et al., 1996)

pactive effort, and method of compaction), dry unit weight (or void ratio), soil
type (i.e., mineralogy and texture), and stress history (or stress state). The
four most important factors: soil type, compactive effort, compaction water
content, and stress history, have the most influence on the nature of the WRC
for fine–grained soils. In Figure 3.6 is illustrated the influence of soil type on the
shape of the WRC. Soils with smaller pores have higher air–entry value. Soils
with a wider range of pore sizes exhibit greater changes in matric suction with
water content and thus the slope of the WRC becomes steeper (Hillel, 1980;
Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993; Vanapalli et al., 1999). As will be addressed in
next sections, specimens of a particular soil, in spite of having the same texture
and mineralogy, can exhibit different WRCs if they are prepared at different
compaction conditions.

48 The influence of compaction on the hydro–mechanical behaviour

3.2.3 Stress state variables

Effective stress approach

Traditional geotechnical engineering studies the behaviour of water or air
saturated soils, that is, soils consisting of two phases: solid particles and water
or solid particles and air. The principle of effective stress for saturated soil was
first stated by Terzaghi (1943) and is commonly expressed in the following form:

?? = ? ? µw (3.5)

where ?? is the effective normal stress, ? is the total normal stress and µw is
the pore water pressure.

Equation 3.5 is a definition of the stress state variable for saturated soils. The
mechanical aspects of a saturated soil are governed by the effective stress. In
other words, all the measurable effects of a change in stress, such as compression,
distortion, and a change in shearing resistance, are exclusively due to changes in
the effective stress, ??. Equation 3.5 was later modified by Bishop et al. (1960)
to account for the effects of soil suction in unsaturated soils. These authors
reasoned that since the unsaturated soil is a three phase system (solid, pore
water, and pore air) and water in voids is not continuous, the total stress will
be the sum of intergranular stress, the pore air pressure (µa), and the pore water
pressure (µw). They suggested that the effective stress (?

?) in unsaturated soils
can be expressed as:

?? = (?n ? µa) + ? · (µa ? µw) (3.6)

where ? is the fractional cross sectional area of the soil occupied by water. For
dry soil, ? will be zero and for saturated soil ? will equal to 1.

Later, Bishop and Donald (1961) pointed out that ? value not only depends
on the degree of saturation, but is also influenced by soil structure, stress mean
value and stress pathway (wetting and drying) leading to a given degree of
saturation. Figure 3.7 shows examples of the deviation of ? value from the
degree of saturation for two materials. This notwithstanding, efforts were made
by Khalili and Khabbaz (1998) in order to develop a unique relation between
? and suction. By the study of shear strength data from several unsaturated
soils in the literature, a unique relation between ? and the ratio of suction to
air–entry value was showed and can be expressed as:

? =

[

(µa ? µw)

(µa ? µw)b

]

?0,55

(3.7)

where (µa ? µw)b refers to air entry value.
Later, Khalili et al. (2004) proposed an incremental form of effective stress

parameter to account for suction effects suggesting that for suctions greater than
air entry, ? value varies as outlined in Equation 3.7, but for suction less than air
entry, ? value was equal to 1. This concept was tested on shear strength data
from the literature having reached good agreement between the measured and
predicted values in all cases. As so, the authors concluded that shear strength
can be predicted using the effective stress concept.

compacted soils (Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993)

Biarez et al. (1991), Fleureau et al. (2001) have shown that an effective stress
approach could be used to take into account the effect of negative pore pressure
in the interpretation of data in the very small strain domain. Recently, Coussy
and Dangla (2002), starting from thermodynamical considerations, confirmed
the validity of the effective stress approach from a theoretical point of view as
long as the behaviour of the unsaturated soil could be considered as elastic. The
authors tried to extend Biot’s theory of poroelasticity used in saturated media
to model the behaviour of unsaturated soils through an energy approach. This
approach yields a consistent general framework to formulate the constitutive
relations. Fleureau et al. (2003) summarizes this approach which leads to the
following expression:

?
?

ij = ?ij + p
?

u · ?ij (3.8)

where ?ij is the stress tensor and p
?

u · ?ij appears as an isotropic tensor and is
termed the capillary stress. Its expression is similar to Equation 3.6 with ? = Sw
(degree of saturation in water), but with an additional term corresponding to
the work of the interfaces. Independently from the expression of p

?

u, which
can be obtained by other methods, this approach validates the effective stress
concept when the behaviour of the soil is elastic (Fleureau et al., 2003).

Another approach to define effective stresses starts from the expression of
the intergranular forces between two particles in an idealized medium, at the
microscopic level, defined as a Micromechanical Model (Biarez et al., 1993).
The method consists of calculating the force Fcap due to water menisci between
two grains of soil, modeled as balls. The balls are supposed to be perfectly
water–wettable, gravity is neglected; the menisci are spherical tores, tangent to
the particles. The pressure in the air phase is atmospheric (ua = 0). According
to the authors, if a partially saturated media consisting of solid grains, air
and water is considered, four types of behaviour may be considered according
to the hydric state. These types are : discontinuous water phase (kw = 0),
discontinuous air phase (ka = 0), discontinuous water and air phase and the
particular case of clusters (fig. 3.8). Only the the two first cases were considered.



50 The influence of compaction on the hydro–mechanical behaviour

Figure 3.8: Schematic representation of four types of behaviours (Biarez et al.,
1993)

The first one concerns to low degrees of saturation. In this case water is
supposed to be discontinuous (kw = 0) and air continuous, water forms menisci
at the contact points between particles; the water pressure inside the menisci
is negative (uw &amp;lt;ua). Experimentally, such conditions are observed for water
contents lower than than the shrinkage limit. In that case, the intergranular
forces due to water are perpendicular to the planes tangent to the particles at the
contact points and cannot, therefore, result in a rearrangement of the structure
or in a volume change. However, these forces contribute to the strength of the
medium. Considering two spheres with the same diameter, the expression of
the attraction force resulting from water meniscus (“capillary” force) is:

Fccap = Smen · uc (3.9)

where Smen, the cross–section area of the meniscus in the plane tangent to
the spheres at the contacting point, is directly related to the diameter of the
balls and the curvature radii of the meniscus, i.e., to the negative pore water
pressure through Laplace’s law, and uc is the negative pore pressure. The pas-
sage from discontinuous to continuous medium is made by considering regular
arrangements of balls. Four types of arrangements were considered (fig. 3.9),
with densities ranging from 0.83 Mg/m3 (tetrahedric) to 1.81 Mg/m3 (dodeca-
hedric). In a representative elementary volume (REV ), the capillary stress in a
direction is given by:

where R is the radius of the balls, ?, the surface tension of the liquid. The
function of the void ratio, f(e), is derived from a quadratic interpolation between
the values of f(e) for the four considered arrangements:

The concept of capillary stress can be extended to real soils, e.g. by deriving
the “characteristic dimension” R from the experimental data (Biarez et al.,
1993).

Also based on this model, Modaressi et al. (1995) proposed another expres-
sion (eqs. 3.14 and 3.15) for determination of p

As so, for low degrees of saturation effective stress is given by Equation 3.16.

The second case refers to high degrees of saturation. At this stage the air
forms isolated bubbles within the voids (ka = 0). The water phase is continuous
and completely wets the grains. As there is no contact between the air bubbles
and the solid grains, pore air pressure plays no part in the strength of the
medium, but the presence of the bubbles makes it more compressible. In that
case, Terzaghi’s effective stress concept is valid and p

?

u is equal to uc. As so, the
above expression became as follows:

?

u = ? + uc (3.17)



52 The influence of compaction on the hydro–mechanical behaviour

Many experimental validations of this model have been presented by the
authors in the past years that showed, in particular, its ability to model the
failure criterion of unsaturated soils.

Independent state variable approach

Another concept to describe unsaturated soil behaviour is the independent
state variable approach. Fredlund and Morgenstern (1977) presented a theoret-
ical stress analysis of an unsaturated soil on the basis of multiphase continuum
mechanics. The unsaturated soil was considered a four–phase system. The soil
particles were assumed to be incompressible and the soil was treated though
it were chemically inert. The analysis concluded that stress state of an unsat-
urated soil can be described by any two of the three possible combinations of
stress variables, namely: total normal stress (?), pore air pressure (µa), and
pore water pressure (µu). Possible combinations are given in Table 3.2.

Table 3.2: Possible combinations of stress state variables for an unsaturated soil

Reference pressure Stress state variables
Air, µa (? ? µa) and (µa ? µw)

Water, µw (? ? µw) and (µa ? µw)
Total, ? (? ? µa) and (? ? µw)

These researchers showed that stress state variables, (? ?µa) and (µa ?µw),
were the most advantageous combination because the effects of a change in
total normal stress can be separated from the effects caused by a change in the
pore–water pressure. The first tensor contains the net normal stress terms and
the conventional shear stress components. The second tensor represents the
matric suction stress, being an isotropic tensor. The complete form of the stress
state for an unsaturated soil can be written as following two independent stress
tensors, which are illustrated in Figure 3.10.

(? ? µa) =

?

(µa ? µw) 0 0

Fredlund and Morgenstern (1977) also carried out he null–type test by vary-
ing the individual components (?, µa, µw) of the stress sate variables in a such
way that the stress state variables remained constant assuming that this would
produce no distortion or volumetric change of the soil. Based on the results of
the null tests, the above stress state variables were qualified for describing the
mechanical behavior of unsaturated soils.

Accordingly to this approach, a saturated soil can be viewed as a special
case of an unsaturated soil. The four phases in an unsaturated soil reduce to



Hydro–mechanical behaviour 53

two phases for a saturated soil (i.e., soil particles and water). There is also a
smooth transition between the stress state for a saturated soil and that of an
unsaturated soil. As an unsaturated soil approaches saturation, the degree of
saturation, S, approaches 100%. The pore–water pressure, µw, approaches the
pore–air pressure, µa, and the matric suction term, (µw – µa), goes towards
zero, disappearing this stress tensor. Only the first stress tensor (Eq. 3.20)
is retained for a saturated soil when considering this special case, commonly
referred to as effective stress (Terzaghi, 1943).

3.3 Hydro–mechanical behaviour

It is widely recognised that hydro–mechanical behaviour of many geoma-
terials, in terms of stiffness (Tatsuoka et al., 1997), compressibility and shear
strength (Burland, 1990) is significantly affected by structure.

With respect to compacted geomaterials, the compaction conditions, namely
molding water content, compaction energy and compaction technique play a fun-
damental role on the structure of compacted geomaterials, that in turn, strongly
affect their hydro–mechanical behaviour. Lambe (1958b) distinguished a floc-
culated fabric in clay samples compacted dry of optimum and a dispersed fabric
in samples compacted wet of optimum. Subsequent inspection by scanning elec-
tron microscopy and mercury intrusion porosimetry allowed direct observations
of pore size distribution (Barden and Sides, 1971; Delage et al., 1996; Suriol
and Lloret, 2007; Romero and Simms, 2008; Koliji et al., 2010). Fine–grained
soils compacted dry of optimum generally tend to exhibit a fabric made up
of aggregates having a bimodal pore size distribution, whereas samples com-
pacted wet of optimum tend to show a more homogeneous matrix–dominated
fabric and single pore size distribution (Barden and Sides, 1971; Delage et al.,
1996). Experimental evidence have shown the influence of structure on the
hydro–mechanical behaviour of geomaterials (Seed and Chan, 1959; Santucci di
Magistris et al., 1998; Sivakumar and Wheeler, 2000; Wheeler and Sivakumar,
2000; d’Onofrio and Penna, 2003; Santucci di Magistris and Tatsuoka, 2004).



54 The influence of compaction on the hydro–mechanical behaviour

With respect to geomaterials in unsaturated state, not only different struc-
tures but also suction plays an important role on its hydro–mechanical be-
haviour. With the purpose to a better understanding of the hydro–behaviour of
unsaturated geomaterials, firstly the influence of compaction conditions on the
mechanical behaviour (stiffness, compressibility and strength) of saturated geo-
materials is reviewed. Then, the influence of compaction conditions on hydro–
behaviour of unsaturated geomaterials is addressed.

3.3.1 Influence of compaction on saturated geomaterials

Stiffness

It is known that compaction conditions strongly affect dry density, thus void
ratio, which plays a fundamental role on the small strain stiffness of geomate-
rials. A general expression as proposed by different investigators for the small
strain shear modulus (G0) of geomaterials is of the following form:

G0 = S · f(e) · p
?n (3.21)

where S is a non–dimensional material constant reflecting the fabric and struc-
ture of the soil, f(e) is the void ratio function and p

?

is the mean effective
principle stress or confining pressure. A number of studies have been conducted
to estimate void ratio function (Hardin and Richart, 1963; Lo Presti et al., 1995;
Santos, 1999; Hadiwardoyo, 2002). Two types of formulas are used:

f (e) =
(B ? e)

2

1 + e
(3.22)

f (e) = e?x (3.23)

Equation 3.22 results from the experimental observation of shear waves in
soils (Vs) conducted by Hardin and Richart (1963), whereas Equation 3.23 re-
sults from Lo Presti et al. (1995) investigations. Santos (1999) and Gupta et al.
(2007) summarize functions and constants in proposed equations. As a general
conclusion, modulus increases with decreasing void ratio. Nevertheless, it is
noteworthy that the differences between these reference void ratio functions are
more evident at low void ratios.

d’Onofrio and Penna (2003) investigated the influence of compaction con-
ditions on the small strain behaviour of a clayey silt with a clay fraction of
about 28%, liquid limit about 50% and plasticity index of 17.8%. Specimens
were prepared at the same dry density and water content adopting two different
compaction procedures: dynamic (Standard Proctor) and kneading (Harvard)
compaction technique. Both Proctor and Harvard specimens were saturated at
constant volume prior to undergo the torsional shear and resonant column tests.

The initial shear modulus measured on Proctor and Harvard compacted
specimens during isotropic compression phase are plotted respectively in Figure
3.11. The relationship between G0 and p

?

was found to be not unique: e.g. G0
measured at the same mean effective stress, can vary up to 30% for different
water content. Data was fitted by power function (Eq. 3.24) with stiffness index,
n, slightly varying with water content, ranging between 0.3 and 0.4, regardless
of the compaction procedure adopted.

The stiffness coefficient S was found to be substantially affected by both wa-
ter content and preparation procedure even though when initial shear modulus
was normalized by the same void ratio funtion. The normalised stiffness coef-
ficients, S?, are plotted in Figure 3.11c against the compaction water content
for specimens dynamically compacted (open dots) and by kneading (full dots).
The influence of both water content and preparation technique is effective in
a limited range around the optimum water content. The authors argue that
compaction water content lead to structure of different stiffness in the tested
soil while the effect of the preparation technique results in different texture of
the soil that, in turn, may yield to a different anisotropy induced in the soils by
different compaction method.

Santucci di Magistris and Tatsuoka (2004) carried out a similar investigation
on a silty sand (Meltramo silty sand) with Dmax of 2 mm, Cu of about 400, a
clayey fraction of about 16% and wL of 35% and IP of 14%. Triaxial com-
pression tests were performed on specimens of Meltrano silty sand compacted

at different molding water contents and with different compaction energy (fig.
3.12a). The relationships between the effective vertical stress (?

?

v) and E0 mod-
ulus are shown in Figure 3.12b includind isotropic and anisotropic tests results.
The authors reported two trends: (i) at isotropic stress states, the E0 value
increases with increasing ?

?

v, but in a different way at anisotropic stress state;
(ii) the speciemns compacted at the optimum water content have the largest
stiffness when compared to the values of the specimens compacted dry and wet
of optimum.

stress and small strain Young modulus; (c) Relationship between the small strain
stiffness coefficients corrected for void ratio and water content ratio (Santucci di
Magistris and Tatsuoka, 2004)

A similar method to d’Onofrio and Penna (2003) was used for data inter-
pretation. Data from isotropic stress states was fitted by a power law (Eq.
3.24) and a stiffness index around 0.6 was obtained for the different molding
water contents. Then, the power law was normalized by the same void ratio
function. The stiffness index, n, was the same and the relationship between
stiffness coefficient, S? and remolding water content is shown in Figure 3.12c.
Samples compacted by using modified Proctor energy exhibited a peak value at
optimum water content. The authors attributed the variation of S? to effects
of microstructure even though they could not explain why it peaks at optimum
water content.



Hydro–mechanical behaviour 57

Compressibility

Lambe (1958a) reported that, at relatively low stress levels, clay specimens
compacted wet of optimum were more compressible than those compacted dry
of optimum, while the reverse was observed at relatively high stresses.

d’Onofrio and Penna (2003) also investigated the compressibility of com-
pacted specimens. The initial water content was found to significantly affects
the compressibility of both Harvard and Proctor compacted specimens. The
compressibility index (?) first decrease at increasing moisture content down
to a minimum value corresponding to the optimum water content and then
increase on the wet side of optimum water contents, as illustrated in Figure
3.13. They state that it appears that compaction at different water content
affects the soil constants within isotropic compression line, thus resulting in
effectively different materials. From isotropic compression tests on compacted
specimens of Meltramo silty sand Santucci di Magistris and Tatsuoka (2004)
found a similar trend. From evaluation whether the variation in the ? value
with molding water content was due solely to the different compacted densities
or effects of microstructure, they concluded that not only dry density, but also
the microstructure controls the compression properties.

Figure 3.13: Compressibility parameters (d’Onofrio and Penna, 2003)

Santucci di Magistris et al. (1998) investigated the influence of compaction
conditions on the compressibility of Meltramo silty sand by means of isotropic
or K–compression stages in triaxial cell and oedometers tests. Speciemens were
prepared to different degrees of moisture and density adopting three different
methods: (1) modified Proctor compaction; (2) hand–tamping compaction; (3)
slurry consolidation. Specimens of Meltramo silty sand were compacted with
modified Proctor at optimum and wet of optimum (+2.5%) water content in
order to study the influence of water content on the compressibility. It was
found higher compressibility from specimen compacted wet ot optimum, which
agrees with results from d’Onofrio and Penna (2003). In contrast, the same ?
was obtained from remoulded specimens with different initial water contents,
but the position of the normal consolidation line of the wetter specimen lyied
higher in the compression plane (v,p

?

) .

Further, Santucci di Magistris et al. (1998) also conducted isotropic com-
pression tests on compacted specimens (modified Proctor) with slightly different



58 The influence of compaction on the hydro–mechanical behaviour

initial void ratios. Identical ? were obtained (fig. 3.14a).

With respect to compaction method, results obtained by d’Onofrio and
Penna (2003) showed that a change from dynamic to kneading compaction has
relatively little effect on the compressibility index (see fig. 3.13), but differences
were found on the axial and radial deformations measured during isotropic com-
pression stage, where the ratio between axial and radial deformations was al-
ways found to be lower than 1 for the dynamic compaction and higher than 1 for
the specimens prepared by kneading compaction. Santucci di Magistris et al.
(1998) found no differences between compressibility index obtained from com-
pacted specimens with modified Proctor and with hand–tamping compaction
(fig. 3.14a). Hence, they claim that limited differences in preparation do not
seem to affect the compressibility of the studied material, provided that the
same initial density is attained through the compaction technique. In contrast,
remoulded specimens presented higher ? (fig. 3.14b).

and tamped specimens; (b) modified Proctor, tamped and remoulded specimens

Strength

Experimental evidence have shown that compaction conditions may influence
the pre–peak stress–strain behaviour (d’Onofrio and Penna, 2003; Santucci di
Magistris and Tatsuoka, 2004), but seems to do not influence ultimate shear
strength (Seed and Chan, 1959; Santucci di Magistris et al., 1998; Santucci di
Magistris and Tatsuoka, 2004; Tarantino and Tombolato, 2005; Oh et al., 2008).

d’Onofrio and Penna (2003) and Santucci di Magistris and Tatsuoka (2004)
investigated the pre–peak behaviour and reported similar behaviour to the one
verified in the small strain domain. Proctor specimens compacted at optimum
water content exhibited higher shear stress rather than specimens compacted
at dry and wet of optimum. Santucci di Magistris and Tatsuoka (2004) showed
that relationship between the q/p

?

value at a fixed strain and the dry density be-
comes less unique as the referred strain becomes smaller, reflecting the pre–peak
behaviour at small strains. As the referred strain becomes larger a more unique
relationship is obtained rather independent of water content and compaction

energy level.

Experimental data from Santucci di Magistris et al. (1998), Tarantino and
Tombolato (2005) and Oh et al. (2008) evidence that both ultimate shear
strength are independent of compaction conditions in the (q,p

?

) and (v,p
?

)
space, as illustrated in Figure 3.15. In the light of critical state theory (Wood,
1990), the critical state models for saturated soils are defined in terms of three
state variables: mean net effective stress, p

?

, deviator stress, q, and specific vol-
ume, v. At critical state these variables are related through three critical state
parameters, M, ?, and ? and the following equations:

q = M · p
?

(3.25)

v = ? ? ? · ln(p
?

) (3.26)

where M is the slope of the projection of the critical state line in (q,p
?

) plane,
? is the intercept (at p

?

= 1 kPa), and ? is the slope of the projection of the
critical state line in (v,ln(p

?

)) plane.

60 The influence of compaction on the hydro–mechanical behaviour

3.3.2 Influence of compaction on unsaturated geomateri-
als

Water retention curve

Specimens of the same geomaterial, in spite of having same texture and
mineralogy, can exhibit different water retention curves if they are prepared
at different initial molding water contents. As a result, the hydro–mechanical
behaviour will also differ.

Experimental data about the effect of molding water content on the water re-
tention curve is provided by Marinho and Stuermer (2000). They examined the
effect of compaction water content on the drying branch of the water retention
curve for a residual soil of Gneiss (LL = 48%, PL = 29% and % &amp;lt;2µm = 45%).
In Figure 3.16 is shown results from samples compacted at Modified Proctor en-
ergy and varying initial water content. Specimens were equilibrated, by drying,
to a different water content and water retention curve associated with each
specimen was determined.

One note that, though specimens MP2 and MP4 have the same initial dry
density, at different compaction water content presented different water reten-
tion curves. During the drying process samples compacted near the optimum



Hydro–mechanical behaviour 61

water content or below it (MP2) always presented smaller suction than samples
compacted at wet of optimum (MP4). For low degrees of saturation curves tend
to be similar, irrespective of the original compaction state. The differences re-
ported were attributed to differences in microstructure built into the specimen
by the compaction procedure.

Vanapalli et al. (1999) investigated the influence of initial water content on
the hidraulic behaviour of sandy clay. Specimens were statically compacted to
100 mm in diameter and 21 mm in height in a single layer. A series of tests was
carried out on three sets of specimens, each one prepared with the same dry
density, i.e, constant void ratio, and with initial water contents ranging from
12.5 and 19.2%, which included dry of optimum, optimum and wet of optimum
specimens. The matric suction was determined from individaully compacted
specimens with a null pressure plate using the axis–translating technique. The
results obtained from each specimen allowed to compare the relationship be-
tween matric suction versus degree of saturation with the drying water retention
curve determined from a single specimen and are shown in Figure 3.17.

Figures 3.17a, 3.17b and 3.17c shows the best–fit drying water retention
curves for specimens with water contents dry of optimum, optimum and wet
of optimum, respectively, and results of individuals compacted specimens with
the same void ratios and varying water contents. At each set of results, differ-
ences between best–fit drying water retention curves and results of individuals



62 The influence of compaction on the hydro–mechanical behaviour

compacted specimens are given to varying initial water contents, which leads
to different structures (and aggregation) during compaction. For the range of
void ratios studied (0.52–0.58), the authors found a clear relationship between
gravemetric water content versus matric suction and concluded that was the ini-
tial water content which governed the matric suction of individually compacted
specimens.

Different void ratios can be achieved by varying compaction energy. The
influence of void ratio on the hydraulic behaviour is given by the variations
on the water retention curve due to variations on void ratio. Barrera (2002)
investigated the influence of void ratio on water retention curve through mea-
suring suction of compacted specimens at a fixed dry density and varying water
contents. Suction was measured in each sample and water retention curve is
plotted. If the target dry density is changed a new water retention curve is
determined. Figure 3.18 shows the final result for the Barcelona low plasticity
silty clay. For a given degree of saturation, increasing the soil density leads to
increasing suction. Differences tend to reduce as the soil becomes wetter, but
the effect of density is clearly marked.

Figure 3.18: Water retention curves for different constant densities of Barcelona
low plasticity silty clay (Barrera, 2002)

An alternative procedure to determine the influence of void ratio on the
WRC consists on compaction to a given state followed by suitable application
of a stress–suction path. Following this procedure Karube and Kawai (2001) and
Sun et al. (2007) confirmed the above conclusion, i.e., the denser the specimen
the higher the degree of saturation at the same imposed suction and the main
wetting and drying curves are dependent on the current density.

The influence of both initial water content and compaction energy is evi-
denced from investigations performed by Vanapalli et al. (1999) and Tarantino
and Tombolato (2005). In Figure 3.19 is shown moisture density compaction
curves for different compaction pressures and respective water retention curves
for a speswhite kaolin presented by Tarantino and Tombolato (2005). Though
only optimum and wet of optimum seems to be reached only for 1200 kPa com-
paction vertical stress, it is clear that water retention curves depends on com-



Hydro–mechanical behaviour 63

paction pressure. Similar results were obtained from Vanapalli et al. (1999).
Moreover, it is noteworthy that the air–occlusion suction for the specimens
compacted at 1200kPa vertical stress is very close to the suction of the spec-
imen at the optimum (solid square in fig. 3.19). This result shows that the
transition from dry to wet optimum states corresponds to the transition from
continuous to discontinuous air phase.

1200 kPa. The solid square indicates the optimum for the 100 kPa compaction
curve; (b) Water retention curves for the respective compaction vertical stresses
(Tarantino and Tombolato, 2005)

Investigations from Huang et al. (1998), Gallipoli et al. (2003) and Tarantino
and Tombolato (2005) confirms that the water retention curves are void ratio
dependent and main drying curves and main wetting curves are characterised by
two surfaces in the space (s, e, Sr) or (s, e, ew), s being suction, Sr being degree
of saturation, e being the void ratio and ew the water ratio (volume of water
per volume of solids). Furthermore, Tarantino (2009) concluded that mechanical
scanning behaviour investigated in the reconstituted studied materials was also
affected by void ratio.

Stiffness

Further, Fleureau et al. (2003), Coronado et al. (2005), Yang et al. (2008)
and Caicedo et al. (2009) have investigated the influence of water content on
the mechanical behaviour.

Fleureau et al. (2003) investigated the small strains properties of a resid-
ual silty sand (Perafita sand). Several tests performed under several confining
stresses and stress deviators and under isotropic stresses allowed to studied the
influence of water content on maximum modulus. Measurements were carried
out using two different triaxial cells with local strain measurements for tests
on large (320 mm high and 160 mm in diameter) and small (140 mm high and
70 mm in diameter) specimens. Specimens were compacted with varying mois-
ture content to the chosen dry density by means of a vibrating hammer. Figure
3.20a shows that, for the unsaturated specimens and for the same void ratio and
under the same vertical stress, there is a general increase in the modulus when



64 The influence of compaction on the hydro–mechanical behaviour

the water content decreases, as long as the water content is strictly larger than
0. For the unsaturated specimens, the variations of normalised modulus ver-
sus total vertical stress approximately followed a power law, with an exponent
n = 0.35 ? 0.45. On the other hand, the lines for the dry and quasi–saturated
specimens were nearly superimposed, with a stiffer slope (n = 0.68).

pretation of very small strains triaxial tests using Biarez et al. (1993) microme-
chanical model for the definition of effective stresses (Fleureau et al., 2003)

Further, the interpretation of small strain modulus using Biarez et al. (1993)
micromechanical model for the definition of effective stresses was attempted.
Expressed against the effective stress, all the results were correctly located near
the regression line of the dry and quasi–saturated specimens, as illustrated in
Figure 3.20b.

Also Coronado et al. (2005) and Caicedo et al. (2009) found identical trend
for unbound granular materials having attributed the increasing modulus with
decreasing water content to the increase in capillary forces in the menisci that
form between grains. Also here lines corresponding to the evolution of modulus
with total vertical stress are more or less parallel for different moisture contents,
as illustrated in Figure 3.21.

Qian et al. (1993) studied the effects of initial void ratio at compaction
on the very small strain shear modulus of sands in resonant column. All the
tests were conducted under isotropic stress conditions. Thirteen cohesionless
soils were selected for testing to investigate shear modulus under unsaturated
conditions. The test sands were prepared by mixing soil and distilled water to a
pre–selected degree of saturation. Specimens were then prepared by compacting
the soil-water mix to the required void ratio in a metal mould mounted directly
on a resonant column device. As illustrated in Figure 3.22, they demonstrated
that the value of the maximum shear modulus ratio should be greatest in a soil
that has the lowest void ratio, all other factors constant.

The influence of compaction conditions on the small strain modulus was
investigated by Mancuso et al. (2002) from resonant column tests on Meltramo
silty sand. Specimens were tested on a controlled–suction resonant column–

torsional shear device after compaction by the modified Proctor at the optimum
molding water content (wOPM = 9.8%) and on the wet side of the compaction
curve (wOPM + 2.5%), resulting an average specific volume of v = 1.338 ± 0.009
and v = 1.462 ± 0.004, respectively. Experimental data showed that the effect
of suction on initial shear stiffness is significant, causing an increase in Gmax
ranging from 50 to 85% for the optimum compacted soil and from 40 to 165%
for the wet of optimum compacted soil, depending on stress level. Most of
the effects were detected for suctions ranging from 0 to about 200 kPa. For
values higher than 200 kPa, Gmax tends toward a threshold that depends on the
net stress level. The stiffness versus suction curves showed an S–shaped trend
(fig. 3.23) which was explained on the basis of the different ways in which bulk
water and menisci water affect soil behavior, and was theoretically justified by
distinguishing three different zones on each Gmax versus suction curve: zone 1
pertaining to suctions lower than the air–entry value of the soil (i.e., bulk–water
regulated behavior); zone 2 involving a progressive shift of soil behavior from a
bulk–water regulated response to a menisci-water regulated response; and zone
3 where menisci–water effects prevail.

More recently Sharma and Bukkapatnam (2008) reached a similar trend
through a different procedure. A stiffness investigation was carried out on spec-
imens of a clayey silt with 19% clay and 79% silt, compacted at optimum water
content 16% and saturated in such a way the dry density of specimens was
maintained. Specimens were then subjected to dying by increasing air pressure
and stiffness of specimen was obtained from shear wave velocity measurements
by means of bender elements. G0 increases with decreasing degree of saturation,
thus increasing matric suction, and S–shape was verified.

The influence of all compaction conditions on the small strain modulus was
studied by Sawangsuriya et al. (2008). They investigated the relationship of
small strain modulus with moisture content for different types of geomateri-
als, namely a lean clay (CL), a silt (ML) and a clayey sand (SC). Small strain
modulus was obtained from shear wave velocity by means of bender elements.
Specimens were prepared with standard Proctor effort over a range of molding
water contents: 4% and 2% dry of optimum, optimum and 2% and 4% wet of op-
timum. The variation of shear modulus with matric suction and molding water
content is presented in Figure 3.24. In general, the shear modulus increases as
matric suction increases and molding water content decreases. They stated that
shear modulus of a given compacted soil depends primarily on matric suction
and to a lesser degree on molding water content and dry unit weight.

Sawangsuriya et al. (2008) also investigated the relationship of small strain
modulus with compaction energy, namely, reduced, and enhanced Proctor, which
corresponds to 15, 25 and 35 hammer blows per layer. Material studied was a
sandy clay (SC). As illustrated in Figure 3.24, the influence of compaction en-
ergy on suction is less significant than molding water content. The SC material
compacted with standard Proctor effort had higher suction than that compacted
with enhanced and reduced Proctor efforts. This notwithstanding, at lower wa-
ter contents, a higher small stiffness modulus was obtained from specimens
compacted by the enhanced Proctor (higher compaction energy). Differences
on small strain stiffness tend to vanish at higher molding water contents.

Compressibility

Sivakumar and Wheeler (2000) and Wheeler and Sivakumar (2000) con-
ducted an investigation on the influence of compaction condition on the me-
chanical behaviour of an unsaturated compacted clay. The effect of molding
water content and compaction pressure on the compression behaviour were high-
lighted.

To investigate the influence of molding water content a series of 12 specimens
(test series 2) were statically compacted at water content of 25%, corresponding
to 4% dry of optimum from standard Proctor compaction. A specific volume
of 1.976±0.009 and a degree of saturation of 68.1±0.8 were obtained. Another
series of 6 specimens (test series 4) involved static compaction at water content of
28.5% (near the standard Proctor optimum), resulting in similar specific volume,
1.954±0.009 and a degree of saturation of 79.8±0.9. Controlled–suction triaxial
tests were carried out and in Figure 3.25a are presented the results from isotropic
consolidation stage for test series 2 and 4. Small differences of the values of
specific volume were observed between test series. This notwithstanding, in
particular the post–yield data at zero suction show much lower values of specific

volume in series 4 than in series 2. The authors argue that this results are due
to the change in compaction water content, rather than to the small difference
in initial specific volume achieved by the two methods of compaction because
a much larger difference in the compaction–induced specific volume, between
other test series, had a lesser effect.

In addition, Sivakumar and Wheeler (2000) and Wheeler and Sivakumar
(2000) investigated the influence of void ratio on the mechanichal behaviour
of unsaturated speswhite kaolin (fig. 3.25b). Controlled–suction triaxial tests
were performed on specimens statically compacted at two different compaction
pressures, hence different void ratios were obtained at the same water content.
The greater compaction pressure employed, hence the lower void ratio, has
resulted in additional expansion of the LC yield curve. Moreover, they reported
that normal compression lines from samples at higher dry density lie below
the corresponding normal compression lines from samples at lower dry density,
although the lines from the two series of tests do tend to converge at high
values of mean net stress. As so, authors stated that this difference suggests
that compaction to a different pressure affects some of the soil constants, thus
resulting in effectively a different material.

pression behaviour: comparison of typical results from series 2 and series 4;
(b) Influence of compaction pressure on the isotropic compression behaviour
(Sivakumar and Wheeler, 2000)

Also Estabragh et al. (2004) and Sun et al. (2007) found initial void ratio to
influences the collapse behaviour of geomaterials. Figure 3.26 shows the results
of isotropic compression tests on compacted specimens at different initial void
ratios under suction of 147 kPa. These specimens were prepared by statically
compacting samples to different vertical stresses at the same water content of
26%. It can be seen that even under the same imposed suction, a looser specimen
has higher compressibility. Moreover, the yield stress increases as the initial void
ratio of the compacted specimen decreases, i.e., there is an additional expansion
of the LC yield curve as mentioned above.

Following an identical procedure to Sun et al. (2007), Estabragh et al. (2004)
carried out an investigation on an unsaturated compacted silty soil. Isotropic
consolidation tests on controlled–suction triaxial apparatus were performed on
loose and dense specimens prepared by static compaction at the same water

content but with two different compaction pressures. They found that com-
pressibility index (?) for dense (fig. 3.27a) and loose (Fig. 3.27b) samples is a
function of suction. The value of ? decreased with increasing suction for suctions
greater than 80 and 100 kPa for dense and loose samples, respectively. However,
it appeared to decrease sharply as the suction was reduced to zero. This be-
haviour was not consistent with the model of Alonso et al. (1990), who proposed
that the slope of isotropic normal consolidation lines ? decreases monotonically
with increasing suction from the saturated value, becoming asymptotic at high
suctions. Authors argue that it was possible that ? increased with decreas-
ing suction right down to zero suction, and there was then a discontinuity in
the value of ? corresponding to the change from unsaturated to saturated con-
ditions. In contrast to conclusions from Sivakumar and Wheeler (2000) and
Wheeler and Sivakumar (2000), experimental results for both dense and loose
samples show that the normal compression lines for different values of suction
diverge with increasing mean net stress, where this divergence was more clear
in the case of dense samples.

samples (Estabragh et al., 2004)



70 The influence of compaction on the hydro–mechanical behaviour

Finally, the influence of compaction technique was investigated by Sivakumar
and Wheeler (2000) and Wheeler and Sivakumar (2000). The results indicated
that a change from static compaction to dynamic compaction (standard Proctor)
was found to had relatively little effect on the soil behaviour.

Mancuso et al. (2002) also performed controlled–suction tests on triaxial
apparatus to study compressibility of Meltramo silty sand of unsaturated spec-
imens compacted at different molding water contents and dry densities, as pre-
viously referred. From experimental data they found that compressibility in-
dices almost double going from optimum to wet of optimum, which denotes the
influence of molding water content. Furthermore, compressibility indices sig-
nificantly decreased with increasing suction. Data showed typical behaviour of
fine–grained unsaturated soils (Alonso et al., 1990) in terms of compressibility,
in particular the apparent yield points which were fitted by a unique LC locus,
as they belong to a single after–compaction yield curve.

Strength

Fleureau et al. (2003) conducted consolidated undrained triaxial tests, with
measurement of the negative pore water pressure, on specimens compacted with
varying initial water content. The test results are shown in Figure 3.28. When
the water content increases, there is a progressive change from brittle to plastic
behaviour. For water contents lower than 8%, the stress–strain curves present
a peak and the specimens seem strongly dilatant. On the other hand, for water
contents larger than 16%, perfectly plastic and slightly contractant behaviours
were observed. However, in all the tests, the volumetric deformations remained
very limited (1 to 1.5%). The authors claimed that in the first case, the negative
pore water pressure in the menisci creates strong bonds between the grains, that
increase the strength of the material and prevents it deformation. When the
water content increases, the grains begin to be surrounded by water, and the
behaviour of the soil tends towards that of the saturated soil at the same void
ratio.

Moreover, interpretation of the triaxial tests results using Biarez et al. (1993)
micromechanical model for the definition of the effective stress was attempted.
The paths of unsaturated specimens were found to finish near the same maxi-
mum strength criterion as the quasi–saturated specimens.

The effect of initial water content on shear strength is clear from results
obtained from drained direct shear tests on silty clay presented by Maaitah and
Mahadin (2004). In Figure 3.29a are shown the relationship between degrees
of saturation and shear strength for three normal stresses. As the degree of
saturation increases up to 25% the shear strength increases and then it becomes
nearly constant between degree of saturation 25 to 50%. As the saturation
increases more than 50% the shear strength decreases. Maaitah (2005) explains
this behaviour on the basis of bulk–water regulated behaviour and menisci–water
regulated behaviour. The effect of initial void ratio on unsaturated strength
was also investigated. As illustrated in Figure 3.29b, to a decrease in void ratio
corresponds an increase in shear strength. This is also confirmed by Fleureau
et al. (2003) results. Differences decreased for low and high degrees of saturation.

Further, Maaitah (2005) analysed some of the results in the light of the
critical states (Wood, 1990) and compared with saturated drained tests. The
unsaturated critical state lines in the plane (q,p) were found to be parallel to

the saturated lines, as illustrated in Figure 3.30.

Wheeler and Sivakumar (2000) also conducted an investigation on the influ-
ence of compaction conditions at the critical states. Four series of samples were
prepared by static (series 1, 2 and 4) and dynamic compaction (series 3). The
compaction details for series 1–4 are shown in Figure 3.31a.

Mahadin, 2004)

Controlled–suction triaxial tests were carried out at constant suction. For
each value of suction no significant influence of compaction conditions, namely,
water content and compaction energy, was observed on the location of the crit-
ical state line in the (q,p

?

) plane. At critical states it seems that unsaturated
critical sate lines are parallel to saturated critical state line in the (q,p

?

) plane
(fig. 3.31b) and interception with q is a function of suction according the Equa-

tion 3.27. Hence, the angle of internal friction at the critical state appears to be
independent of the soil suction. Experimental data from Mancuso et al. (2002)
and Wang et al. (2002) confirms that the slope of critical state line of the un-
saturated studied materials at different suctions are parallel on the (q,p

?

) plane
to the saturated critical state line for a silty sand and a silty soil, respectively.

and Sivakumar, 2000)

In contrast, Estabragh and Javadi (2008) reported that slope of critical state
line in the (q,p) plane is suction dependent and decreases with increasing suc-
tion. On the investigation of a silty soil, they found that critical state lines at
different suctions are not parallel and, on the conducted experiments, meet each
other at a point with a mean net stress of about 950 kN (fig. 3.32a). Figures
3.32b and 3.32c shows the variation of M(s) and µ(s) with suction. It appears
that the value of M(s) decreases with increasing suction, whereas µ(s) follows

an inverse trend, although not in a linear fashion as assumed by Alonso et al.
(1990).

and Javadi, 2008)

With respect to critical state line in the plane (v,p
?

), accordingly to Wheeler
and Sivakumar (2000), compaction pressure had no apparent effect on the re-
lationship at this plane, suggesting that any differences in initial fabric caused
by increased compaction pressure are erased by shearing to a critical state.
However, molding water content appears to affect the critical state line at this
plane, suggesting that differences in soil fabric produced by compaction at dif-
ferent water contents are not completely erased even by shearing to a critical
state. They state that a possible explanation lies in the two levels of soil fabric
within samples compacted dry of optimum: the macrostructural arrangement of
large clay packets and interpacket voids, and the microstructure within individ-
ual packets. The critical states observed in triaxial tests probably correspond
to shearing of the macrofabric to a critical state, whereas the relatively strong
microfabric of individual clay packets may not reach a critical state, so that the
influence of the initial fabric is not completely erased. As so, Equation 3.28
defines the critical state line in the (v,p

?

).

v(s) = ?(s) ? ?(s) · ln(p) (3.28)

On the other hand, Mancuso et al. (2002) and Estabragh and Javadi (2008)
reached different results from experimental data. For the studied materials the
critical state values of v appear to fall on a unique critical hyperline for each

value of suction and were nearly parallel (fig. 3.33). However, Estabragh and
Javadi (2008) reported that the position and the slope of the critical state line
at zero suction (saturated condition) were very different to those of the critical
state lines for unsaturated soil samples. These trend is also contrary to the
model presented by Alonso et al. (1990).

Figure 3.33: Variation of specific volume (v) and mean net stress at critical
state condition (Estabragh and Javadi, 2008)

Concerning to the influence of compaction technique, Wheeler and Sivaku-
mar (2000) concluded that a change from static to dynamic compaction, with
no change in compaction water content or compaction induced dry density, had
no apparent effect on subsequent material behaviour. This was consistent with
the fact that there was no influence on behaviour under isotropic stress states.

3.4 Summary

This chapter reviews basic concepts related to the hydro–mechanical behav-
ior of unsaturated geomaterials where suction plays a fundamental role. In turn,
suction is influenced by water content whose relationship can be described by
the soil water characteristic curve (SWCC), also known as soil water retention
curve (WRC). Then is presented the effective stress concept for saturated geo-
materials, contrasting with the effective stress concept for unsaturated geomate-
rials. With regards to unsaturated geomaterials two approaches are commonly
used in the literature: effective stress approach and independent state variable
approach. In this investigation the effective stress approach was used.

This chapter focus on the influence of compaction conditions (water con-
tent, compaction energy and compaction technique) on the hydro–mechanical
behaviour of saturated and unsaturated geomaterials is reviewed. It is presented
the state of the art on the water retention curve, stiffness, compressibility and
strength of unsaturated soils found in published literature about the topics. The
hydro–mechanical behaviour of unsaturated geomaterials is not straightforward
due to the presence of suction and, even at critical states, the results found on
literature are contradictory.



Chapter 4

Experimental program

4.1 Introduction

The experimental program is developed in three parts, namely, a laboratory
test campaign, a full scale trial performed on a railway embankment and another
trial carried out in a road embankment.

The execution of these trials was greatly conditioned by the impossibility to
fully perform the initially planned work, in the aim of a cooperation protocol
between the National Railway Network (REFER) and four national research
institutions (University of Minho, UM; National Laboratory of Civil Engineer-
ing, LNEC; New University of Lisbon, FCT/UNL; and Technical University of
Lisbon, IST) to develop the knowledge concerning the methodology for the con-
struction and control of the railway embankments and rail track layers for high
speed trains. This was established under the framework of a national research
project POCI/ECM/61114/2004, entitled “Interaction soil–rail track for high
speed trains”, financed by the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT).
In this protocol was planned:

- Execution of a trial embankment to establish a methodology of construc-
tion for optimization of embankments performance;

- Construction and observation of two definitive railway embankments, one
built according to traditional technologies of construction and control, and
another built according with the new technologies of construction and con-
trol. During the construction of definitive embankments instrumentation
and monitoring during and post construction would be done. This would
allow comparison of performances from the two embankments, as well as
eventual comparison with numerical models developed in this context.

In the aim of this protocol it was only possible to perform the trial embank-
ment, which is called hereafter E?vora Trial Railway Embankment (ETRE).

However, another contract between the Centre for Waste Valorisation (CVR)
and Portuguese Steel Companies (SN), including University of Minho, allows to
obtain more knowledge about this subject also under the framework of another
National Research program founded by FCT. In fact, a trial road embankment
was constructed, giving the possibility to carry out different studies using spot

and continuous compaction control tests, as well as the instrumentation of the
embankment and road layers to measure vibrations and strains induced by the
compaction equipment and load traffic. Hereafter this trial embankment is
referred to as Fafe Trial Road Embankment (FTRE).

Additionally to the fields tests and monitoring of the embankment trials a
laboratory tests program was performed. It was intended to characterize the
materials and to support modeling behaviour of materials and the interpretation
of field tests in a more phenomenological way.

The experimental program adopted will be described in the following main
sections:

- Laboratory investigation;

- E?vora trial railway embankment (ETRE);

- Fafe trial road embankment (FTRE).

4.2 Laboratory investigation

The laboratory investigation involved the study of five materials: Clayey
sand (SC), Crushed aggregate 0/31.5 (CA31.5), Poor–graded silty sand (SP),
Inert Steel Aggregate for Construction (ISAC) and Crushed aggregate 0/40
(CA40).

However, in the scope of this thesis only SC and CA31.5 were object of a
laboratory investigation, namely, physical, hydro and mechanical characteriza-
tion. Therefore, a detail description of the tests carried out on these materials
will be presented. Concerning the remaining materials, these were studied in
the aim of another doctoral thesis (Reis Ferreira, 2010). It is worth to note that
these materials were employed in trial embankments.

4.2.1 Physical characterization

SC and CA31.5 materials were first subject to identification tests, grain
size distribution, Atterberg limits, Specific Gravity, Methylene Blue Adsorption
method, Sand Equivalent test, and Standard and Modified Proctor tests. A list
of tests is presented in Table 4.1.

4.2.2 Hydro characterization

The hydro characterization (suction–water content relationship) was carried
out only for SC material. State conditions were defined in order to provide
information about the influence of the variation of moisture content on the
behaviour of studied materials. The specimens were compacted to 97% of the
maximum dry density of Modified Proctor, i.e., to the same void ratio, by means
of a vibrating hammer, over the range of following molding water contents:

- 4 % dry of optimum (wOPM?4%);

- 2 % dry of optimum (wOPM?2%);

- optimum (wOPM);

- 2 % wet of optimum (wOPM+2%).

It is noteworthy that this molding water contents covers the range of the
moisture contents employed in field investigation, which will be described in
following main sections.

As mentioned in Chapter 3, the filter paper technique was employed to mea-
sure matric suction of SC specimens. The inicial negative pore water pressure
(under ?3 = 0) was controlled by means of calibrated filter papers Whatman
#42, ashless quantitative Type II, with a diameter of 9 cm. In this technique,
after compaction, two initially dry filter papers were placed on the top and
bottom of the specimens. The outer filter papers were used for suction mea-
surement, while the filter papers in contact with the specimen were used to
protect the outer filter papers from soil fouling or contamination. To ensure
good contact between the specimen and the filter papers and to make easier to
manage the set, specimen and filter papers were sandwiched by acrylic plates
and then wrapped up in a plastic foil. After that, the set is placed in a airtight
plastic bag and stored inside an temperature controlled cabin. Then, the filter
papers and the soil specimen moisture content were allowed to equilibrate.

An equilibrium period of at least 14 days was allowed for the specimens,
filter paper, and the air in the sealed container to reach equilibrium. At the
end of the equilibration period, the filter papers were removed from the soil
specimen, and the wet mass of the outer filter papers were measured with a
high precision balance with 0.0001g accuracy. The measurement process was
completed within a few seconds to avoid moisture loss from the filter papers.
Subsequently, filter paper and soil were oven–dried at 110?C for 24 hours. The
moisture contents of each were individually determined. The equilibrium filter
paper water content of the specimen was then converted to matric suction values
by calibration curve (Bicalho et al., 2011).

Series of tests were conducted over the range of molding water contents pre-
viously defined. At each series corresponding to a given molding water content,
three tests were carried out. The state parameters of each test are given in
Table 4.2.

The specimen preparation procedure is the same for all samples. Each one is
mixed up with the right quantity of water and it is placed in a sealed plastic bag
four 24 hours to achieve uniform moisture conditions. After the hydric equilib-
rium period is reached specimens were compacted with a vibrating hammer in
a cylindrical mould with 100 mm in diameter. During compaction process the

specimen height was controlled by the time of vibration in order to obtain the
fixed dry density. With this purpose, specimens with 100 mm in diameter and
25 mm high were prepared.

4.2.3 Mechanical characterization

Mechanical characterization was carried out on specimens in unsaturated
conditions and in the small and large strain domain, involving oedometer tests,
triaxial tests and triaxial tests in a stress–path Bishop–Wesley triaxial chamber
with measurement of S–waves velocity. In addition, tests in dry or saturated
conditions were performed as reference tests. In Table 4.3 are presented the
tests performed on SC and CA31.5.

Oedometer test

In order to study the compressibility of SC material under unsaturated
and saturated conditions the oedometer test was performed (UNE 103–405–94,
1994). Conventional oedometer equipment and procedures for incremental load-
ing were used. A series of load increments and decrements were applied and the
settlement was recorded continuously. The series of load increments and decre-
ments are: 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 500, 1000, 500, 200, 100 kPa. Previous
to the first load increment a preload was applied not exceeding 3 kPa. After the
final decrement the final moisture content of the sample was determined.

In Table 4.4 are summarized the conducted tests and respective state pa-
rameters. One test with high value of void ratio was performed to determine
the intrinsic properties of the soil.

The specimens preparation procedure is similar to all the type of tests. How-
ever, in this particular case, before material mix up with the right quantity of
water, first, it was sieved to avoid the presence of coarse grains (maximum sixe:
4.75 mm). This was due to the high of the oedometer ring, with dimensions of
19.6 mm high and 70 mm in diameter.

After the hydric equilibrium period, compaction was performed in the same
mold used for the preparation of all other specimens, with 100 mm in diameter.
The mass of material was placed together with the oedometer ring inside the
mold. Once again, the time of vibration was that necessary to obtain the desir-
able volume. This procedure was adopted since it has the advantage that only
the top of the specimen contained in the oedometer ring needs to be trimmed
flush.

Triaxial test procedures

Triaxial testing is commonly used to quantify the shear strength of a geo-
material, and procedures for such testing are well established. Nevertheless, to
obtain maximum information from a limited number of tests and to eliminate
the effect of soil variability, a multistage testing procedure was attempted (Ho
and Fredlund, 1982; Reis Ferreira, 2010). Thus, triaxial tests were conducted
using three stages corresponding to isotropic consolidation stresses of 100, 200
and 300 kPa.

The method consists of applying an isotropic stress of 100 kPa corresponding
to the first stage of testing and the sample is allowed to consolidate. Once no
further sample volume change can be detected, the sample is in equilibrium with
the applied isotropic stress. After consolidation is complete, the minor principle
stress (?3) is maintained while the sample is loaded at a constant strain rate. A
“cyclic loading” procedure was adopted in testing the sample, as illustrated in



80 Experimental program

Figure 4.1. The deviator stress was applied until it was apparent that the stress
was reaching a peak value. At this point, the vertical load was “backed–off”
the sample. After that, a new set of stress corresponding to the second stage
(?3 = 200 kPa) is applied to the sample, consolidation is again allowed, and
the loading process is repeated as before. For the last stage, corresponding to
?3 = 300 kPa, the deviator stress is applied until the critical state is reached.

Figure 4.1: Example of a multistage test result

As mentioned before (see Table 4.3), besides unsaturated tests, also dry and
saturated triaxial tests were performed as reference tests. In addition, triaxial
tests with only one stage, corresponding to ?3 = 300 kPa, and isotropic triaxial
tests were carried out in order to allow comparison with the last stage of the
multistage tests and so, to evaluate if results are influenced by the multistage
procedure.

In all triaxial tests, the drainage system remained open. In Tables 4.5 and
4.6 are summarized the triaxial tests conducted on each studied material and
respective state parameters.

The specimen preparation procedure is identical for both materials. Each
one is mixed up with the right quantity of water and it is placed in a sealed
plastic bag four 24 hours to achieve uniform moisture conditions. After that,
all specimens are compacted by a vibrating hammer. The time of vibration was
that necessary to obtain the fixed dry density.

To perform triaxial tests on SC, specimens with 100 mm in diameter and
200 mm high were prepared. After the hydric equilibrium period is reached, in

order to get the best possible standard homogeneity, compaction was performed
in four layers, each one with the same mass of material, in a 100 mm diameter
cylindrical mould. For the first layer of 50 mm compression was performed
until the desire volume was reached. The other three layers were successively
compacted on the top of the previous one using the volume criterion. The
interface between the different layers were carefully scarified in order to provide
good bonding between them.

The same procedure was adopted for CA31.5. However, due to material
grain size, specimens with 150 mm in diameter and 300 mm high were prepared.
These were compacted in six layers using the same mass of material for each
one.

A conventional strain–controlled triaxial press was used to perform triaxial
tests. The loading rate of 0.03 mm/min for compression was adopted, which
corresponds to 0.015% and 0.010% strain per minute for specimens with 200 mm
high and 300 mm high, respectively. The vertical strain was confirmed by means
of an external displacement transducer. Conventional triaxial cells were also
instrumented with a load cell, located just above the top cap inside the triaxial
cell in order to eliminate piston friction effects. Also, two pressure transducers
and two volume controllers were used, one to control the pressure–volume of the
fluid in the cell and the other to control the pressure–volume of the sample (for
saturated tests).

Triaxial tests with measurement of S–waves velocity. Setup and pro-
cedures

A series of tests using bender elements and accelerometers was carried out
with the purpose to get data in the small strain domain.

Once no chamber was prepared to incorporate bender–extender elements,
it was necessary to adapt an existing one. Therefore, the system design was
influenced by the characteristics of equipment and sensors available in the Lab-
oratory of Civil Engineering at the University of Minho. For the development
of this system, a Bishop–Wesley stress–path chamber was used and adapted to



82 Experimental program

accommodate the bender–extender elements and the accelerometers.
With regard to bender–extender elements, two bottom and top sensors and

one lateral sensor were available. However, only the bottom and top sensors
to be installed on the platens were used. New bottom and top platens were
designed and manufactured and modifications in stress–path chamber, including
drilled holes for cable outlet, were made, as illustrated in Figure 4.2. In Figure
4.3 top and bottom platens are presented with embedded bender–elements. It
is worth to note that each platen is composed of two parts. This solution was
determined by the fact that the sensors are equipped with original cables and
plugs that were not changed in order to preserve the quality of transmitted
signals. The bender–extender elements used in this work were manufactured
by GDS Instruments (2011) and allow transmission of P–waves and S–waves.
However, only measurement of S–waves were performed. This was due to the
maximum limit of the acquisition frequency rate allowed by the acquisition
equipment used, which does not enable measurement of P–waves.

Concerning to accelerometers, two sensors whose physical characteristics, in-
cluding the mass and dimension, allow the installation on the side of the sample
were available. To measure the soil vibrations on the sides of the specimen it
should be guaranteed adequate coupling to the specimen, so that is ensured the



Laboratory investigation 83

sensors horizontality and stability during measurements. Thus, sensors were
fixed to the sides of the specimens at specific points, by means of designed pins
screwed to the back of the accelerometers. After specimen placement on the
stress–path cell, pins are spiked into the specimen. This involves drilling the
membrane and, therefore, careful isolation of the hole must be guaranteed. The
accelerometers, from Bru?el and Kjær, are piezoelectric sensors type 4513–001,
with sensivity of 100 mV/g, measure range of ± 50 g, a frequency range between
1 and 10 kHz, with dimensions of 12.7 mm in diamenter and 15.65 mm high and
approximately 9 grams in weight (fig. 4.4).

Figure 4.4: Accelerometer and pin (Ferreira et al., 2010)

The final setup is illustrated in Figure 4.5. The conceived testing system
comprises a total of four sensors: two bender-extender elements and two ac-
celerometers. The sensor located on the bottom platen is the transmitter BE
that sends seismic S–waves, which travel through the specimen, and are received
and recorded by the remaining transducers, the receiver BE and the accelerom-
eters.

The associated electronics equipment consists of two main components: a
function generator from Thurlby Thandar Instruments (TG1010A model) and
a National Instruments data logger system (SCXI–1600), with 16–bit accelerom-
eter cards (SCXI–1531), connected to a portable computer. The function gen-
erator produces the output signal in the form of a sine pulse to a transmitting
bender element with the maximum amplitude allowed by the equipment (±10 V)



84 Experimental program

in order to enhance the response of the bender element–soil system. Data acqui-
sition was performed at the maximum allowed by equipment (200 kHz), that is
to say, a frequency of 50 kHz per channel, which corresponds to a ?t = 0.00002s.
The portable computer was used to display and collect the signals.

A specific LabVIEW interface was developed for data acquisition and record-
ing. The program operates similarly to an oscilloscope: triggered signals are
detected and an average of 16 pulses, which are stacked to improve signal–to–
noise ratio, is displayed. In addition, each channel can be individually amplified
by a user–defined factor, as shown in Figure 4.6.

Figure 4.6: Sample display of acquisition program developed in LabVIEW

Triaxial tests with measurement of S–waves velocity were conducted only
on SC specimens. The test consisted in three phases. Firstly, measurements of
S–waves velocity were performed without application of stresses (?3 = 0 kPa) on
specimens. Secondly, specimens were submitted to isotropic stresses, namely, 25,
50, 100 kPa, and consolidation was allowed. For each stage measurement of S–
waves velocity were conducted. Finally, similarly to triaxial tests, a multistage
testing procedure was adopted, using three stages corresponding to isotropic
consolidation stresses of 100, 200 and 300 kPa. However, the deviator stress was
applied until approximately 30% of the peak value at each stage. This was due
to constraints on the air pressure system. Besides unsaturated tests with the
previous defined state parameters, also a dry isotropic test was performed. In
Table 4.7 is summarized the triaxial tests program with the state parameters
for each specimen.

SC specimens dimensions and preparation procedure are similar to the ones
previously described for standard triaxial tests. Likewise, the loading rate of
0.03 mm/min for compression was adopted, which corresponds to 0.015% strain
per minute. This was possible through the implementation of a control system
developed by Arau?jo (2007).

A load cell located just above the top cap inside the triaxial cell and a
pressure transducer to control pressure of the fluid inside the cell were used.

No volume controllers were used in this type of test. This was due to the
implementation of the accelerometers, which are not prepared to work under
water. To this end, air was used instead of water for application of confining
pressures. Volume change was estimated from triaxial tests volume change
curves.

4.3 Field investigation: E?vora trial railway em-

bankment (ETRE)

Under the framework of a national research project mentioned previously,
a protocol between the Portuguese National Railways Network (REFER) and
and four national research institutions (UM, LNEC, FCT/UNL, and IST) was
established, which focused the following main objectives:

- Establishment of a methodology of construction for optimization of em-
bankments performance;

- Development of a specification of the plate loading test to be used as a
reference method;

- Methodology for calibration of dynamic plate loading tests, like Falling
Weight Deflectometer (FWD), Soil Stiffness Gauge (SSG), Spectral Anal-
ysis Surface Waves (SASW) and others;

- Application of continuous compaction control by different tools (like Por-
tanceme?tre and integrated compaction control) and methodology for cal-
ibration;

- Establishment of a methodology for quality control of compacted layers
by using spot methods and continuous approach.

To reach the goal, a trial embankment was constructed with the cooperation
of REFER, MOTA–ENGIL and GEOCONTROLE. This one took place near the
new railway line between “Sines” and “Caia”, in section “Casa Branca – E?vora”



86 Experimental program

at PK 106+800, about 2.5 km from the “Monte das Flores” railway station, and
running tests between October and November of 2006.

An experimental program was established consisting on the employment of
different materials and on the in situ evaluation of physical and mechanical
properties.

4.3.1 Materials

Two type of materials were tested: SC for the embankment layers and
CA31.5 for the sub–ballast layer, as shown in Figure 4.7.

4.3.2 Experimental plan

In order to fulfill the main objectives established on the protocol an ex-
perimental plan was developed involving optimization of thickness layers con-
structed over a range of different moisture contents, for different energy levels
corresponding to the passes of the compaction equipment. A Caterpillar CS–
583D smooth drum vibratory roller was used during investigation, which is
classified as V4 accordingly to LCPC/SETRA (1992). For each energy level,
the behaviour of trial layers, with different thicknesses and moisture contents,
were then evaluated by means of field tests.



Field investigation: E?vora trial railway embankment (ETRE) 87

Geometry

Trial layers were planned to be constructed with dimensions in plant of
50 m length and 6 m width. Then a mesh was created in order to establish the
location to run field tests. This consisted in dividing width into lanes with 2 m
(A, B, C) and length into columns with 5 m (1 to 10), thus, resulting grids with
dimensions 5×2 m2. For each grid a set of field tests would be conducted to
evaluate physical and mechanical properties of the trial layer, for each energy
level applied. In Figure 4.8 is shown the adopted mesh. It should be noted
that lanes A and C, were provided for all types of tests, while lane B was only
subject to non–destructive tests.

Figure 4.8: Mesh created for ETRE trial layers with dimensions of 50×6 m2

However, due to space and time constraints, not all layers were constructed
as initially planned. Some layers were constructed with half of the length (25 m)
and/or were constructed over another layers, instead over foundation.

Taking into account the optimization of trial layers thicknesses, these were
defined accordingly to the ones commonly used with the studied geomaterials.
For SC trial layers thicknesses of 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m were employed, while for
CA31.5 trial layers thicknesses of 0.22 and 0.30 m were employed.

Moisture conditions of materials

After geometry definition, moisture conditions were established. A range
of three different moisture contents were employed on SC trial layers: (i) 2%
dry of optimum (wOPM?2%); (ii) optimum (wOPM); (iii) 2% wet of optimum
(wOPM+2%). Concerning to CA31.5 trial layers only optimum moisture content
(wOPM) was employed. Moisture content was established in relation to modified
Proctor test for both geomaterials. The geometry and moisture conditions of
the trial layers are summarized on Table 4.8.

Concerning to the water application, it is worth noting that the methodology
adopted was similar to the one employed on embankment dams. To achieve
desirable moisture contents, materials were stack and water was added. Then
materials were mixed up by means of a front shovel.

It should be pointed out that before the construction of the trial layers, su-
perficial soils with poor quality were removed. An excavation of 0.60 m depth
was made within an area of approximately 2000 m2. In order to promote homo-
geneity of the support of the trial embankment, foundation with 0.60 m thickness

was compacted in two layers with 0.30 m thickness each, with moisture content
in the dry side of the modified Proctor curve. Each layer was compacted with
energy level corresponding to twelve passes of the vibrating roller.

Field tests on trial layers

To evaluate the state conditions and mechanical properties of the several
layers, for different energy levels, the following fields tests were performed:

- Sand cone method (SCM) performed by LNEC;

- Nuclear method (NM) performed by LNEC;

- Static Plate Load Test (SPLT) performed by UM;

- Soil Stiffness Gauge (SSG) performed by LNEC;

- Ligth Falling Weight Deflectometer (LFWD) performed by LNEC;

- Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) performed by UM;

- Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) performed by UM;

- Portanceme?tre performed by GEOCONTROLE.

The SCM and NM allow determination of state parameters, while the others
enable determination of mechanical properties. As stated in Chapter 2, only
Portanceme?tre allows continuous compaction control.

The experimental plan was established according to the mesh previously
defined and is illustrated in Figure 4.9. As mentioned previously, some trial
layers were constructed with half the length, i.e., 25 m instead of 50 m. In these
cases, only half of the experimental plan was carried out. It should be noted
that in lanes A and C, the Portanceme?tre passes were done after the SPLT
tests. Each layer was tested for different energy levels corresponding to 4, 6,
8, 10 and 12 passes of the vibrating roller. Exceptions must be made to some
tests, which were not performed due to either time and/or weather constraints.

In Tables 4.9 to 4.12 a summary of the number of spot tests conducted is
made according to type of geomaterial and moisture content.

With regards to SPLT, whenever the number of tests are presented as, for
example, 8 + 5, it means that were conducted 8 tests following AFNOR standard
and 5 tests following DIN standard (recall Chapter 2). Concerning the remaining
tests, whenever the number of tests are presented as, for example, 4 + 2?, it
means that 6 tests were conducted, 2 of which were done at the same spot
where SPLT were performed.

4.4 Field investigation: Fafe trial road embank-

ment (FTRE)

In the aim of a national research project POCI/ECM/56952/2004, entitled
“Application of waste in transportation infrastructures and geotechnical con-
structions – Re-use of steel slags” financed by the Foundation for Science and
Technology (FCT), the Portuguese Steel Companies (SN) required Centre for
Waste Valorisation (CVR) to conduct an experimental field study with the goal
to validate/calibrate in situ the results obtained in laboratory for the processed
steel slag, actually named Inert Steel Aggregate for Construction (ISAC) pro-
duced in the Portuguese Steel Companies. The ISAC should be used in the base



Field investigation: Fafe trial road embankment (FTRE) 91

and sub–base layers, in capping layer and embankment layers.
To reach the goal, CVR collaborating with Laboratory of Civil Engineering

of University of Minho (LEC–UM) and with LNEC promoted the construction
of a trial road embankment, which took place in the itinerary between “Fafe”
and “Cabeceiras de Basto” (E.N. 311), at “Va?rzea Cova”. Also “Ca?ndido Jose?
Rodrigues” (CJR) and GEOCONTROLE cooperated in the construction and
continuous compaction control, respectively. The work and tests run between
October and November of 2007.

Likewise in ETRE, an experimental plan was established to evaluate physical
and mechanical properties of the trial road embankment. Besides behaviour
evaluation, vibrations measurements were performed during the execution of
road layers.

4.4.1 Materials

The construction plan consisted on the the employment of ISAC with the
purpose of in situ validation/calibration of results obtained in laboratory for
ISAC geomaterial. To meet this goal, also traditional materials were employed,
namely SP and CA40, in such a way to allow comparison between ISAC and tra-
ditional geomaterials. In Figure 4.10 are illustrated the geomaterials employed
and a general view of the trial road embankment.

4.4.2 Experimental plan

An experimental plan was established in order to fulfill three main objec-
tives: (i) execution of trial layers to optimize thickness layer and energy level
corresponding to the passes of the vibrating roller, while state conditions remain
constant; (ii) evaluate materials behaviour during execution of trial, embank-
ment and road layers; (iii) measurements of vibrations of the roller drum, as well
as vibrations and compression vertical strains of the capping layer due to appli-
cation of dynamic loads, during and after compaction process. A Hamm 3412
smooth drum vibratory roller was used during investigation, which is classified
as V3 accordingly to LCPC/SETRA (1992).

Geometry

The construction plan consisted in three sections, each one with 10 m length,
with different configurations adopted regarding the employment of ISAC and
traditional materials, as illustrated in Figure 4.11. The three configurations
were the following:

1. One only employing traditional materials, SP on embankment and capping
layers and CA40 on base layer;

2. One employing SP on embankment and capping layers and ISAC on base
layer;

3. One employing ISAC on embankment, capping and base layers.

Figure 4.11: Construction scheme of the FTRE

All sections had the same width corresponding to the width of the embank-
ment. Similarly to the experimental plan adopted on ETRE, a mesh was created
in order to establish the location to run field tests. This consisted in dividing
each layer into two lanes, named hereafter left side (LS) and right side (RS),
and into columns with 5 m width (0 to 7), as illustrated in Figure 4.12. For each
grid a set of field tests would be conducted to evaluate physical and mechanical
properties of the trial layer, for each applied energy level.

As mentioned above, the construction process developed in three phases.
Firstly, a trial embankment was constructed using ISAC and SP. In this phase,
trial layers with thicknesses 0.30 (1st layer), 0.40 (2nd layer) and 0.50 m (3rd

layer) were constructed (fig. 4.13). State conditions and mechanical properties

were then evaluated for different energy levels corresponding to the passes of the
vibrating roller. The main goal was to optimize thickness of the embankment
layers and energy level, i.e., the number of passes of the vibrating roller. Sec-
ondly, construction of the embankment layers, the capping layer and the base
layer were carried out with 0.40 (4th to 7th layer), 0.40 and 0.20 m thicknesses,
respectively. Finally, bituminous layers were constructed with a total thickness
of 0.14 m.

Figure 4.13: Construction scheme of the FTRE trial layers

Moisture contents of materials

For all materials optimum content, in relation to Modified Proctor, was
adopted. The water application followed similar procedure to ETRE. However,
moisture content was corrected on the embankment ever a deviation was verified
from NM results.

Field tests on trial layers and embankment layers

An experimental plan was established to evaluate the behaviour of trial lay-
ers and of the embankment and road layers. The following in situ tests were
performed:

- Sand cone method (SCM) performed by LEC–UM;

- Rubber balloon method (RBM) performed by LNEC;

- Nuclear method (NM) performed by LEC–UM;



94 Experimental program

- Static Plate Load Test (SPLT) performed by LEC–UM;

- Benkelman beam deflection measurement (BBDM) performed by LEC–
UM;

- Soil Stiffness Gauge (SSG) performed by LNEC;

- Ligth Falling Weight Deflectometer (LFWD) performed by LNEC;

- Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) performed by LEC–UM;

- Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) performed by LEC–UM;

- Portanceme?tre performed by GEOCONTROLE.

The experimental plan was established according to the mesh previously
defined and is illustrated in Figure 4.14. Concerning to trial layers, each one
was tested for different energy levels corresponding to 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14
passes of the vibrating roller. Exceptions must be made to some tests, which
were not performed due to either time and/or weather constraints. Regarding
the remaining layers, tests were performed for the last energy level.

Figure 4.14: Experimental plan adopted on FTRE

In Tables 4.13 to 4.18 a summary of the number of spot tests conducted is
made for the several layers, according to the type of material.

Likewise to ETRE, whenever the number of tests are presented as, for ex-
ample, 4 + 2?, it means that were conducted 6 tests, 2 of which were done at
the same spot where SPLT were performed.

Concerning to continuous compaction control by mean of Portanceme?tre,
tests were performed in every layers and for all energy levels corresponding to
4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 passes of the vibrating roller.

4.4.3 Instrumentation of experimental section

As stated previously, the instrumentation of the experimental sections aimed
the measurement of vibrations of the roller drum, as well as vibrations and
compression vertical strains of the capping layer due to application of dynamic
loads, during and after compaction process. It was intended to get data in order
to investigate the interaction between roller drum and layer to be compacted, as
well as to realize the magnitude of strains induced during application of dynamic

loads with several equipments, such as, FWD, LFWD, the Portanceme?tre and
during application of static loads while performing SPLT.

In this sense, an experimental plan was developed involving measurements
in two sections of the embankment, one executed with ISAC material and the
other with traditional SP material, as illustrated on Figure 4.15.

In order to fulfill these requirements, the instrumentation plan was divided
in two setups: one to be employed during compaction of the capping layer and
another to be employed during and after compaction process of the base layer.
These plans are illustrated in more detail in Figures 4.16 and 4.17.

As can be seen in Figures 4.16 and 4.17, sensors were placed on the same
vertical and horizontal alignments, so the results of both sensors can be related.
In both setups two type of sensors were used:

- accelerometers for the measurement of vertical vibrations;

- strain gauges for measurement of vertical strains.

Figure 4.16: Instrumentation with accelerometers and strain gauges during com-
paction of the capping layer

However, their is a slightly difference between the setups adopted. As illus-
trated in Figure 4.16, during compaction of the capping layer, two accelerome-
ters and one strain gauge placed in depth were used in each section. No strain
gauges near surface of the capping layer were used since vibration of the roller
could damage these sensors. Instead, one accelerometer was used near sur-
face. At the same time, based on some experiences conducted (Rinehart and
Mooney, 2008), two accelerometers were employed on the roller drum to mon-
itor the vibrations experienced by the equipment during compaction, i.e., its



98 Experimental program

behaviour during compaction process. After compaction, FWD, LFWD and
Portanceme?tre were carried out on each section enabling the measurement of
vibrations and vertical strains induced by each test.

Figure 4.17: Instrumentation with accelerometers and strain gauges during com-
paction of the base layer

Before the execution of the base layer, the accelerometer near the surface of
the capping layer was removed and replaced by two strain gauges. Once the
sensors employed in these setup would be unrecoverable, only one accelerometer
was used in each section, since these are more expensive. Thereby, the resulting
setup in each section consisted in one accelerometer and three strain gauges,
as shown in Figure 4.17. Furthermore, two accelerometers were embarked on
the roller drum and vibrations were recorded during compaction process. In
addition, vertical strains were measured during SPLT in each section after com-
paction.

4.5 Conclusions

In this chapter the experimental program adopted was described. This was
developed in three main parts, namely, laboratory investigation, and two field
investigations corresponding to E?vora trial railway embankment (ETRE) and
Fafe trial road embankment (FTRE).

Regarding laboratory investigation, five geomaterials, which were employed
in the field investigation, were studied (clayey sand (SC), crushed aggregate
(CA31.5), poor–graded sand (SP), inert steel aggregate for construction ISAC
and another crushed aggregate (CA40)). However, in the scope of this thesis
only the first two ones, SC and CA31.5, were subjected to a laboratory inves-
tigation and, therefore, a detail description of the tests carried out on these
materials were conducted. Concerning the other materials, these were studied
in the aim of a doctoral thesis Reis Ferreira (2010).

Laboratory investigation involved physical, hydro and mechanical charac-
terization. Firstly, physical characterization was carried out. Secondly, hydro
characterization was performed by means of filter paper method. In order to
provide information about the influence of the variation of moisture content
on the behaviour of studied materials, initial state conditions involved series of



Conclusions 99

tests performed on specimens compacted to 97 % of the maximum dry density
and over a range of molding water contents: 4 % dry of optimum (wOPM?4%),
2 % dry of optimum (wOPM?2%), optimum (wOPM) and 2 % wet of optimum
(wOPM+2%). This range includes the moisture contents employed in field in-
vestigation. Finally, mechanical characterization was performed. Tests were
carried out in unsaturated, saturated and dry conditions and in the small and
large strain domain, which included oedometer tests, triaxial tests and triax-
ial tests in a stress–path Bishop–Wesley triaxial chamber with measurement of
S–waves velocity. These tests were described in detail.

Concerning to field investigation, two trial embankments were conducted:
E?vora railway trial embankment ETRE; and Fafe road trial embankment FTRE.

An experimental program for field investigation on ETRE was developed
involving optimization of thickness layers constructed over a range of different
moisture contents, for different energy levels corresponding to the passes of the
compaction equipment. SC and CA31.5 were employed on trial embankment.
The geometry of the layers were defined and a mesh was created in order to
establish the location to run field tests. Thicknesses of 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m,
and 0.22 and 0.30 m were employed for SC and CA31.5 layers, respectively.
Then, moisture conditions of materials were established over a range of three
different moisture contents: 2% dry ofoptimum (wOPM?2%), optimum (wOPM)
and 2% wet of optimum (wOPM+2%). However, on CA31.5 trial layers only
optimum moisture content (wOPM), was employed. At last, state conditions
and mechanical properties of the several layers were evaluated by means of spot
and continuous tests methods. These were conducted for different energy levels.

Similarly, an experimental program were established for field investigation
on FTRE. SP, CA40 and ISAC material were employed. The experimental plan
sought three main objectives: (i) execution of trial layers to optimize thickness
layer and energy level corresponding to the passes of the vibrating roller, while
state conditions remain constant; (ii) evaluate materials behaviour during ex-
ecution of trial, embankment and road layers; (iii) measurements of vibrations
during and post compaction of the capping and base layer. Geometry including
layers with 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m thickness was defined and a mesh was created
to establish the location to run field tests. Only optimum moisture content,
(wOPM), was employed. Likewise to ETRE, state conditions and mechanical
properties of the several layers were evaluated by means of spot and continuous
tests methods, which were conducted for different energy levels. Finally, a de-
scription of the instrumentation of the capping layer using accelerometers and
strain gauges was carried out.





Chapter 5

Laboratory investigation

5.1 Introduction

A laboratory test campaign was carried out on reconstituted samples of two
geomaterials, a clayey sand (SC) and a crushed aggregate 0/31.5 (CA31.5),
which, as mentioned previously, were employed in E?vora trial railway embank-
ment (ETRE). This study aimed to investigate the influence of compaction
conditions on the mechanical behaviour of these materials. In this scope, void
ratio was fixed corresponding to 97% of the Modified Proctor and moisture con-
tent was varied from 4% dry of optimum to 2% wet of optimum for SC and
from 2% dry of optimum to optimum for CA31.5.

In this chapter, the most relevant results provided by the laboratory tests
will be presented according to the characterization type, namely, physical, hydro
and mechanical and discussed in detail. The tests procedure and specimens state
parameters were described in Chapter 4. One should bear in mind that analysis
will be performed in total stresses.

5.2 Physical characterization

As mentioned above, two geomaterials were used in this study, a coarse–
grained soil, clayey sand (SC), and a decomposed granite classified as a well–
graded gravel with silt and sand (GW–GM), accordingly to the Unified Soil
Classification System (ASTM D2487, 2000). For the sake of simplicity, these
geomaterials are called herein as SC and CA31.5, respectively.

The grain–size distribution curves of both materials are plotted in Figure 5.1,
whereas in Table 5.1 are given the index properties, namely, Atterberg Limits
(NP 143, 1969); Specific Gravity (NP 83, 1965; EN 1097–6, 2000), Methylene
Blue (NF P 94–068, 1998; NP EN 933–9, 2002); Sand Equivalent (LNEC E 199,
1967; NP EN 933–8, 2002), and compaction characteristics determined using
Modified Proctor (LNEC E 197, 1966; EN 13286–2, 2004).

5.3 Hydro characterization

As described in Chapter 4, the hydro characterization was carried out only
for SC material, using filter paper technique to measure matric suction. In
Figure 5.2 is plotted the matric suction versus saturation degree for specimens
with similar void ratio, about 0.331. Three tests per saturation degree were
carried out in order to verify repeatability. The following calibtarion equation
was used (Chandler et al., 1992):

Log10(suction) =

{

4.842 ? 0.0622 · w if w &amp;lt;47,
6.050 ? 2.48 · Log10(w) if w &gt; 47

(5.1)

The matric suctions obtained for the range of molding water contents from
4% dry of optimum to 3% wet of optimum varied from 215 to 8 kPa, respectively.
Matric suction was found to decrease with increasing saturation degree (Sr)
accordingly to expression given in Figure 5.2. One note that there is a strong
power relation with R2 = 0.991 between matric suction and saturation degree.
Regarding to the molding water contents studied, 4% and 2% dry of optimum,
optimum and 2% wet of optimum, the corresponding values of matric suction
are approximatelly 170, 51, 21 and 11 kPa, considering void ratio e = 0.331.

5.4 Mechanical characterization

5.4.1 Oedometer test

A series of one–dimensional consolidation tests under unsaturated and satu-
rated conditions were conducted to study compressibility behaviour of SC com-
pacted specimens. As listed in Chapter 4, one saturated and four unsaturated
consolidation tests were performed. Figure 5.3a shows three unsaturated tests
involving compacted specimens with molding water content corresponding to
4% dry of optimum (wOPM?4%), 2% dry of optimum (wOPM?2%) and optimum
(wOPM), and a saturated test with optimum molding water (wOPM sat). Un-
saturated tests had approximately the same initial void ratio (e = 0.331), cor-
responding to 97% of Modified Proctor, whereas saturated test had a slightly
lower initial void ratio (e = 0.322). In addition, an unsaturated test in a loose
state was carried out in order to obtain the virgin compression line (VCL), and
is illustrated in Figure 5.3b. In Table 5.2 are given the coefficients of compress-
ibility (?c), considering a regression analysis with the last two points of the
loading cycle, and the coefficients of unloading (?u) considering all points of the
unloading cycle.

wOPM 0.0370 0.0034
wOPM sat 0.0170 0.0037
wOPM loose 0.0887 0.0043

In Figure 5.3a it can bee seen that the curves shapes exhibit non linear
behaviour. Despite specimens were submitted to maximum vertical stress of
1000 kPa, one may observe that they did not achieved VCL. More points would
be necessary to better define the slope over a total vertical stress of 1000 kPa.
This notwithstanding, in the lower stress range, before yielding, the curves
shapes are reasonably molding water content independent, which is the same

Figure 5.3: Oedometer tests results from SC specimens in unsaturated and
saturated conditions in: (a) compacted state; (b) loose state

to say suction independent. On the contrary, in the higher stress range after
yielding, curves shapes from unsaturated specimens seems to be suction depen-
dent: to lower molding water content corresponds smaller compressibility (?c),
i.e., there is a decrease of the plastic compressibility with increasing suction. In
fact, one can see from Table 5.2 that ?c are lower for driest specimens. How-
ever, specimen wOPM?2% presents ?c slightly lower than corresponding value
from wOPM?4%. This may be attributed to differences on initial void ratio,
since initial specific volume of specimen wOPM?2% is smaller than the others
unsaturated ones, which are close together. This denotes the importance of
density at high stress levels, which can be stronger than the suction effect and
hide it. Indeed, ?c obtained from saturated specimen is the lowest, which ap-
pears to contradict previous findings since there is any suction contribution.
Nevertheless, the initial void ratio from saturated specimen is the lowest which
strongly influenced specimen compressibility. As so, as far as plastic compress-
ibility is concerned, the influence of suction and density are similar, since any
increase in either of these parameters reduces the compressibility.

The unloading sequences performed at all tests confirm the irreversible na-
ture of the strains. It is interesting noting that ?u for unsaturated specimens
appears to be independent of the suction, since values around 0.0032 were de-
termined. Though specimen in saturated condition had lower initial void ratio,
it exhibited similar swelling on the unloading cycle, where a ?u = 0.0037 was
obtained. The unsaturated specimen in loose state allowed to determine the
VCL. A ?c = 0.0887 and a ?u = 0.0043 were determined. One note that ?u
is slightly higher than values achieved from compacted samples in unsaturated
condition.

The data confirm the general findings that an increased suction produces
a stiffening of the material with smaller plastic compressibility (Alonso et al.,
1990; Cui and Delage, 1996), despite the tight differences observed between un-
saturated tests. Saturated test (zero suction) showed the lowest compressibility



Mechanical characterization 105

which was due to a lower initial void ratio. Further, similar results are pro-
duced by variation of suction and density, since any increase in either of these
parameters reduces the compressibility. Regarding unloading cycle, it appears
that swelling is suction independent for unsaturated specimens.

5.4.2 Triaxial tests on SC specimens

Triaxial test results obtained from specimens under various molding water
contents, i.e., suction, are presented in Figures 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6, corresponding
to confining stresses (?3) of 100, 200 and 300 kPa, respectively.

A non linear behaviour is observed where an important strain component is
unrecoverable. With decreasing molding water content the shape of the curves
gradually changes and the maximum deviatoric stresses increases (figs. 5.4a,
5.5a and 5.6a). An increasingly pronounced maximum is observed at a reducing
strain level, illustrating an increasing britleness of the material with decreasing
molding water content, i.e., increasing suction. However, as confining stress level
increases maximum deviatoric stresses occur at higher strain corresponding to
a reduction in britleness behaviour.

The influence of saturation condition on stress–strain curve decreases with
increasing confining stress level. For optimum molding water content saturated
specimen exhibit slightly lower maximum deviatoric stress at ?3 = 100 kPa (fig.
5.4a), whereas at ?3 = 200 kPa difference decreases (fig. 5.5a) and for the
last stage becomes slightly higher than corresponding value from unsaturated
specimen, which was unexpected. This fact is probably due to the multistage
test progress. Ho and Fredlund (1982) states that in a multistage test progress
the measured peak strength for a certain stage may be smaller than the peak
strength for the specimen under the same stress conditions in a single stage
test. The strength loss results from structure disturbance from previous stages.
With regards to wOPM unsaturated specimen, one can see that specimen ex-
perimented great strain during previous stage (?3 = 200 kPa), as illustrated
in Figure 5.5a. In fact, at that stage specimen reached deviatoric stress peak
at strain about 3%, but specimen was allowed to deform until strain of 4.5%,
which probably induced great structure disturbance. As a result, the measured
peak strength for the last stage was smaller than would be expected. This be-
haviour is testified by the results obtained from two additional samples with
optimum molding water content. In order to verify the influence of multistage
triaxial test procedure, these samples were submitted to saturated and unsatu-
rated triaxial tests (wOPM iso sat and wOPM iso) in a single stage at ?3 = 300 kPa.
Stress–strain curves of these two additional tests are plotted in Figure 5.6a. Al-
though greater plastic behaviour from single stage tests are observed, the peak
deviatoric stresses from one single stage and multistage saturated tests matches
well. Regarding unsaturated tests, peak deviatoric stresses do not agree and
value obtained from one single stage test was greater than multistage test. As
so, one may conclude that the smaller peak value obtained from multistage test
was due structure disturbance experimented at previous stages, namely at stage
corresponding to ?3 = 200 kPa.

Particular results obtained from wdry and wOPM+2% specimen earn to be
discussed apart. Dry specimen unexpectedly presented the highest strength,
thus a second dry specimen was prepared and tested in order to confirm this
result. A stress–strain behaviour on the first stage (?3 = 100 kPa) similar

to the first test was found confirming previous results and, thereby, test was
not continued after this stage. It is believed that hygroscopic water between
fine grains might contribute to a suction effect which, in turn, contributed to
a high peak strength. Hence, triaxial test results from dry specimen should



Mechanical characterization 107

be treated carefully. With regards to specimen wOPM+2% a high reduction of
specific volume is observed in Figures 5.4b, 5.5b and 5.6b. This behaviour was
also unexpected, although no second test was performed in order to confirm the
evolution of specific volume during multistage procedure. Therefore, also this
results should be treated carefully too.

initial molding water contents



108 Laboratory investigation

From volume change curves (figs. 5.4c, 5.5c and 5.6c) one can see contraction
followed by dilation, which features granular materials in a dense state. The
lower is the molding water content (the higher the suction) the larger is the di-
latancy. In fact, for water contents lower than wOPM, specimens seem strongly
dilatant, as illustrated in Figures 5.4d, 5.5d and 5.6d. At the lower confining
stress level (?3 = 100 kPa) all curves are well ordered and evolve regularly with
decreasing water content, i.e., increasing suction. In fact, the negative pore
water pressure in the menisci creates strong bonds between the grains, that
increase the strength of the material an prevents its deformation. When the
water content increases, the grains begin to be surrounded by water and the
behaviour of the soil tends towards that of the saturated soil at the same void
ratio. Further, at remaining confining stress levels it is noteworthy that speci-
men wOPM?2% was slightly dilatant than wOPM?4%. A reduction of contraction
and dilatancy is also observed. These facts indicate that, at higher confining
stress levels (?3 = 200 kPa and ?3 = 300 kPa), confining stress appears to has
major influence on material behaviour than suction.

For the last confining stress level samples were loaded until stabilization of
stress–strain and volume change curves were observed, i.e., until critical state
was reached. Though critical state was not reached for all samples due to
membrane rupture, one can see from Figure 5.6a that all curves tend to the
same stress at larger strains, with exception to dry specimen. From volume
change curves and dilatancy (figs. 5.6c and 5.6d) critical state seems to had
been reached in wOPM sat, wOPM iso and wOPM iso sat tests.

Concerning to specimens deformability, in Figures 5.4e and 5.4f, 5.5e and
5.5f and 5.6e and 5.6f one can observe an increasing secant and tangent moduli
are associated to decreasing water content. Moreover, moduli increases with in-
creasing confining stress, as would be expected, though relative increase between
stages become smaller. Once again, this fact denotes that increasing confining
stress appears to reduce suction effect.

In Figure 5.7 are plotted the peaks deviatoric stress (q) versus mean total
stress (p) obtained from each test, as well as the residual deviatoric stress corre-
sponding to critical states. As would be expected for drained tests on specimens
in dense state, yielding first occurs with q/p &gt; M. Continued deformation is
associated with plastic softening and decrease of stress ratio until a perfectly
plastic critical state is reached with q/p = M (Wood, 1990). The peak failure
envelope is also represented for each test, which relation can be written as in
equations 5.2 and 5.3.

qpeak = Mpeak · p + c (5.2)

qcs = Mcs · p (5.3)

where Mpeak and Mcs are the slope of the peak and critical state failure envelope,

respectively, and c is effective cohesion, c
?

, or apparent cohesion, capparent. The
parameters Mpeak and Mcs are related to the internal friction angle (?) through
Equation 5.4.

One can see that ?peak obtained from unsaturated tests ranges between 31.5
and 39.3?, while ?peak = 37.7

? was obtained from optimum saturated test.
Thereby, a fairly variation of ?peak is observed regarding to unsaturated sam-
ples. One should note that the lowest and highest ?peak (31.5 and 39.3

?),
correspond to wOPM and wOPM+2% tests, respectively. These bound values can
be attributed to multistage procedure. As above mentioned, peak results from
wOPM specimen were affected by excessive shear strain in the second stage,
leading to structure disturbance of specimen as the multistage tests progressed.
As a result, the measured peak deviatoric stress for the last stage (i.e., stage
?3 = 300 kPa) may actually be smaller than that obtained from a specimen un-
der the same stress conditions, using a single stage test. In fact, this hypothesis
was testified with single stage test carried out on wOPM iso unsaturated speci-
men, as illustrated in Figure 5.7. Hence, if wOPM iso peak value is considered
on the determination of ?peak, a value of 35

? is obtained. In Table 5.3 this
hypothesis is identified as wOPM

?. As aforementioned, results from wOPM+2%
specimen should be treated with caution. To sum up, one can conclude that
Mpeak and ?peak obtained from unsaturated test results are similar.

A Mcs of 1.38 was obtained corresponding to a ?cs = 34.1
?. This value is in

agree with the range of values given by Bowles (1970) for a silty sand in a dense
state. The highest ?peak was obtained from dry specimen (wdry), which reflects
the higher britleness of specimen in that state condition. The wOPM?4% and
wOPM?2% tests showed the highest capparent, which seems to reflect the higher
suction of these samples. As water content approaches saturated condition, a
reduction of capparent is observed, reflecting a suction decrease.

The evolution of secant friction angle (?sec) with total mean stress is repre-
sented in Figure 5.7b. On one hand, one can observe that, for identical total
mean stress, ?sec increases with decreasing molding water content. On the other
hand, for the same specimen, ?sec values decrease with increasing mean stress,

where unsaturated specimens with low molding water content present higher
reduction of ?sec values. This shows the great influence of both molding water
content and total mean stress on ?sec values. Moreover, at higher total mean
stress ?sec values get closer and seems to tend to ?sec value at critical state,
which is consistent with de Beer (1965) investigations on granular materials in
a dense state. It should be noted that non linearity of ?sec with total mean
stress leads to an apparent cohesion in the q,p plane (see Table 5.3) which has
only a mathematical meaning resulting from the interception of strength peak
envelope on q axis.

The evolution of specific volume with total mean stress (p) at the end of
consolidation at each stage of a multistage test and during consolidation of the
single stage test are plotted in Figure 5.8. The effect of molding water content on
compressibility is investigated. Further, in order to investigate the influence of
the anisotropy induced by a multistage test, comparison is made with the results
of the isotropic stress applied during consolidation of the single stage test. For
each test the isotropic/anisotropic and peak consolidation line are defined by
Equation 5.5, where ? represents the specific volume corresponding to a total
mean stress of 1 kPa and ? is the slope. These parameters are summarised in
Table 5.4.

One note that ? corresponding to unsaturated specimens increases with in-
creasing water content. As so, one may conclude that compressibility increases
with increasing molding water content, as previously verified from oedometer
tests. Concerning to peak slopes (?peak) the same trend is observed, reflecting,
therefore, the initial molding water content. Moreover, it is interesting noting
that ? corresponding to saturated tests are higher than the ones for correspond-
ing unsaturated tests, i.e, compressibility is higher for saturated samples, which
denotes the influence of unsaturated conditions. Concerning to results from
single and multistage tests, ? for wOPM and wOPM iso unsaturated tests, respec-
tively, are quite similar. In contrast, a greater difference between ? for wOPM sat
and wOPM iso sat saturated tests is observed. Regarding the effect of anisotropy
induced by multistage triaxial tests these results are inconclusive.

In Figure 5.8b critical state line is also plotted. From theory (Wood, 1990)
critical state line lies parallel to VCL obtained from oedometer, yet offset to the
left passing through critical state given by triaxial tests. As would be expected
all points appears to lie on the left side of critical state line, i.e, in the dry side,
which features granular geomaterials in dense sate (Wood, 1990). Exception is
made to dry specimen.

In order to get a better insight on the influence of compaction conditions
on specimens deformability, firstly, Esec is normalized for the same void ratio
accordingly to Equation 5.6, where f(e) is a void ratio function given in Equation
5.7 (Hardin and Richart, 1963).

C and n parameters. It is should be noted that values gathered from triax-
ial tests carried in a single stage (wOPM iso and wOPM iso sat) lie below values
obtained from multistage tests. This fact indicates that multistage procedure
might influence specimen deformability, as observed previously in Figure 5.6.

Regarding to an axial strain of 0.5% stiffness coefficient (C) denotes a de-
creasing stiffness of unsaturated specimens with increasing moisture content,
therefore reflecting the reduction of suction effect on the deformability of the geo-
material. This trend is shown in Figure 5.9b for ?1 = 500 kPa and ?1 = 1000 kPa
and is consistent with results from similar investigations (Fleureau et al., 2003).



114 Laboratory investigation

As specimen moisture content approaches saturated condition Esec decreases
and appears to remain constant beyond optimum moisture content. The same
trend is found concerning to axial strain of 1.0%. However, differences are
smaller reflecting the higher degradation of Esec at this strain level. With in-
creasing strain level the stiffness index (n) approaches unity, which value corre-
sponds to perfect plasticity (Biarez et al., 2005).

In Figure 5.9c is shown the relation Esec0.5%/Esec1.0% for both ?1 = 500 kPa
and ?1 = 1000 kPa. It is noteworthy that relation seems fairly constant as mois-
ture increases beyond optimum value for both stress levels, corresponding to
about 1.7, which is quite similar to relation obtained from normalised degrada-
tion curve given by Ishibashi and Zhang (1993). In what concerns to specimens
with lower moisture content, i.e, higher suction, relation tends to increase and
becomes more pronounced for lower stress levels, which is the same to say that
as stress level increases there is a reduction of suction effect on deformability.

Further, in Figure 5.10 are presented the E
nor

sec / E0 degradation curves for
each confining stress stage. In addition, a reference threshold shear strain given
by Santos (1999) for sandy soils was converted in a threshold modulus strain
and plotted too. This conversion was done considering Poisson ratios of 0.10
and 0.35 corresponding to strain levels of about 10?6 and greater than 10?2,
respectively. The E0 values were obtained from unsaturated triaxial tests using
bender elements, which results will be presented afterwards. The normalized
degradation curves appears to fit reasonably the threshold modulus strain. The
influence of moisture content, i.e., suction, on normalized degradation curves
confining stress is clearly marked. As confining stress increases, differences
between degradation curves become smaller. Therefore, as seen previously, as
stress level increases there is a reduction of suction effect on deformability.

5.4.3 Triaxial tests on CA31.5 specimens

Likewise to SC results, in Figures 5.11, 5.12 and 5.13 are presented CA31.5
triaxial tests results at confining stresses (?3) of 100, 200 and 300 kPa, respec-
tively, obtained from specimens under different molding water contents, i.e.,
different suction.

A non linear behaviour is observed for all confining stress stages (figs. 5.11a,
5.12a and 5.13a) where an important strain component is unrecoverable (figs.
5.11a and 5.12a). As would be expected maximum deviatoric stress increases
with increasing confining stress and stress–strain curves show maximum devia-

toric stress at a reduced strain indicating an increasing britleness behaviour. At
the last stage (?3 = 300 kPa) stress–strain curves show peak deviatoric stress
for all tests results which features stress–strain behaviour of granular materi-
als at a dense state (5.13a). It is noteworthy that unsaturated sample wOPM
presents the highest deviatoric stress at all stages, whereas maximum deviatoric
stress reached from unsaturated sample wOPM?2% lies between optimum satu-
rated and unsaturated specimens (wOPM sat and wOPM). Therefore, at the state
conditions studied, a higher suction effect seems to not be associated to a lower
molding water content as verified previously for SC material. This is probably
due to the low fine content, which is about 6% (see fig. 5.1).

From volume change curves (figs. 5.11c, 5.12c and 5.13c) contraction follow-
ing by dilation is observed, which features granular materials in a dense state.
Volumetric contraction is appreciably the same for all tests, but is achieved
at a reduced strain level with successive stages, thus denoting an increasing
britleness, as seen previously from stress–strain behaviour analysis. Unexpect-
edly, saturated samples showed higher dilatancy than unsaturated ones at stages
?3 = 100 and 200 kPa (figs. 5.11d and 5.12d), yet an inverse behaviour is ob-
served at the last stage (fig. 5.13d). As for SC material, at the last confining
stress level (?3 = 300 kPa) specimens were loaded until stabilization of stress–

Similar peak internal friction angle, ?peak, were obtained from wOPM?2%

?, respectively, which denotes sligtly
greater strength from driest specimen. Results from saturated specimens (w1% sat
and wOPM sat) were found to be identical too, where ?peak of 43.8 and 43.3

? were
obtained. As so, little differences on strength were found whether from satu-
rated or unsaturated specimens and, therefore, one may conclude that suction
has little effect on material strength for the studied state conditions. Taking
into account the negligeable fraction of material passing on sieve no. 200 (about
6%), to some extent, this conclusion would be expected. Moreover, results from
saturated specimens (wOPM sat and w1% sat) indicate that fabric did not played a
significant role on samples strength. The highest ?peak was obtained from wdry
specimen, reflecting the higher britleness of specimen in that state condition.
Critical states seems to had been reached only in wOPM sat test. A Mcs of 1.67
was obtained corresponding to a ?cs = 40.8

stress. Likewise to SC material, ?sec values decrease with increasing total mean
stress. However the highest are obtained from wOPM specimen, whereas corre-
sponding values obtained from wOPM?2% specimen are lower, thereby, confirm-
ing conclusions about suction effect reached on previous paragraph. Though
saturated specimens were prepared in different manner, they present identical
?sec values, which are the lowest.

The evolution of specific volume with total mean stress (p) at the start
of each stage is shown in Figure 5.15 in order to investigate the influence of
the anisotropy induced by a multistage test. These results are compared with
isotropic triaxial tests carried out in order to study compressibility of CA31.5
material, as listed in Chapter 4. The parameters ? and ? for each test are given
in Table 5.7. One can see that slopes from anisotropic and isotropic compression
lines differs significantly. As so, anisotropy induced by multistage triaxial tests
seems to be significant. Relation regarding peak values could not be established.
It is interesting noting that wOPM iso unsaturated specimen showed greater com-
pressibility than corresponding saturated specimen, though the opposite would
be expected. This notwithstanding, differences on slopes are small, thus suction
effect appears to have little influence on compressibility. In Figure 5.15b is plot-
ted the specific volume against total mean stress concerning specimen wOPM iso
in loose state from which virgin compression line was determined.

In Figure 5.15a critical state line is also plotted. From theory (Wood, 1990)
critical state line lies parallel to VCL obtained from isotropic triaxial test, yet
offset to the left passing through critical state given by triaxial tests. As would
be expected all points lie on the left side of critical state line, i.e, in the dry
side, which features granular geomaterials in dense sate (Wood, 1990).

0.5% and 1.0% were considered taking into account the triaxial tests precision
with external measurement. An increasing E

sec with increasing axial stress is
observed following a power law accordingly to Equation 5.8. In Table 5.8 are
summarized the C and n parameters.

With regards to an axial strain of 0.5%, wOPM and saturated tests present
similar values of C and n, yet stiffness coefficient of unsaturated specimen is
slightly lower, thus stiffness is lower. This trend is shown in Figure 5.16b for
?1 = 600 kPa and ?1 = 1200 kPa. A similar analysis is conducted to an axial
strain of 1%, but for stress level domain between ?1 = 1000 kPa and ?1 =
2000 kPa. Parameters C and n show no significant differences on specimens
stiffness, which trend is exhibited in Figure 5.9b. Finally, in Figure 5.9c is shown
the relation Esec0.5%/Esec1.0% considering ?1 = 1000 kPa, where a relation
about 1.75 is found. To sum up, suction seems not to play an important role on
CA31.5 material stiffness for the compaction conditions, stress and strain levels
considered.

vious chapter. In what follows, a brief description of interpretation of BE and
accelerometers signals is made and results obtained from measurements of S–
waves velocity with bender elements and accelerometers will be presented.

Interpretation of BE and accelerometers signals

The interpretation of the BE and accelerometers data was performed in
time domain. Wave velocities were calculated using the travel length and time
measured during the triaxial tests. In Figure 5.17 typical signals of BE and
accelerometers are shown. These signals used as example result from a triaxial
test carried out on wOPM unsaturated specimen. The identification of the ar-
rival time of the shear waves is not obvious, since they are often advanced by
direct and reflected compressional waves (Appendix A). With regards to BE,
the first deflection point recorded can be erroneously taken as the first wave
arrival, however it is caused by near field effect, hence cannot be considered
to correspond to the real shear wave arrival time. The arrival time of shear
waves was then assumed to be located in the point of maximum curvature of
the recorded response curve, which are marked in Figure 5.17 as point BE (in-



Mechanical characterization 123

put signal) and point BE
?

(output signal). Note that the polarity of the input
and output signals is positive, hence the start of the shear wave is expected to
be ascending.

If the same assumption is made for accelerometers signals, the points marked
as Ac

?

(output signals) in Figure 5.17 would correspond to arrival time of shear
waves. However, one can observe from Figure 5.17 that arrival time correspond-
ing to signal labeled as Ac17.5 is greater than respective time for BE receiver
(point BE

?

). Recall setup presented on Chapter 4, Ac17.5 is located at smaller
vertical distance from source (175 mm) than BE receiver (200 mm). Therefore,
arrival time of shear waves should be lower than respective time for BE receiver
(point BE

?

). As so, the first deflection point recorded from accelerometers
sensors was considered to correspond to the real shear wave arrival time.

For each test several frequencies ranging between 100 Hz and 10 kHz were
tested at each isotropic stage in order to verify the value for which receivers
signals amplification was greater. Then, frequency was chosen taking into ac-
count the amplification of the receivers signals, as well as conditions to avoid
near–field effects (recall section A.2). The time domain interpretation herein
used assumes the same travel time for all tested frequencies.

Experimental results

As described in Chapter 4, specimens were isotropically consolidated and
then sheared by the application of large amplitude stress cycles at constant
confining stress in a multistage procedure. In Figure 5.18 are illustrated the
triaxial results by confining stress.

Measurements of S–waves velocity using BE and accelerometers were con-
ducted during shearing and shear modulus (G0) was computed. An overview of
the global evolution of the shear moduli obtained at isotropic and anisotropic
stress states is presented in Figure 5.19. The critical review of literature shows
that the shear modulus of unbound granular materials at the very small strain
follows a power law accordingly to the Equation 5.9. Further, in Tables 5.9 and
5.10 are given the values of parameters C, n, and coefficient of determination
R2.

The experimental results obtained from isotropic stress states show a good
agreement with Equation 5.9, rather than results obtained at anisotropic stress
states. With regards to unsaturated specimens at isotropic stress state, the
variations of modulus versus total vertical stress follow a power law, with ex-

ponent n increasing from 0.336 to 0.522 and from 0.374 to 0.586 for BE and
accelerometers results, respectively, with increasing molding water content, i.e.,
with decreasing suction. On the contrary, coefficient of stiffness C decreases
with increasing molding water content. This trends highlight the increasing
stiffness with decreasing moisture content from unsaturated specimens exhibit-
ing, therefore, the influence of suction.

The dry specimen exhibits the stiffer slope (n = 0.654 and n = 0.737), which
is close to the usual values found for dry granular soils (Fleureau et al., 2003).
Corresponding shear modulus values are similar to the ones obtained from wOPM
unsaturated specimen, which is not fully understood since lower values would
be expected. As mentioned earlier for triaxial tests, this fact may be attributed
to the influence of hygroscopic water.

Although similar trends for exponent n and coefficient C are verified at
anisotropic stress states, slopes (n) and coefficient of stiffness C slightly var-
ied. It appears that induced anisotropy influence shear modulus evolution at
very small strains. This notwithstanding, G0 depends noticeably on total mean
stress, being always larger for driest unsaturated specimens. Further it is note-
worthy that power laws for driest specimens (wOPM?4% and wOPM?2%) are
more or less paralell. The same happens with quasi–saturated specimens (wOPM
and wOPM+2%), yet presenting a stiffer slope and being almost superimposed.
Fleureau et al. (2003) achieved similar trends regarding “Perafita” sand.

Further, shear modulus was corrected to the same void ratio by using Equa-

The data plots are quite similar to the ones observed previously (see fig.
5.19 and Tables 5.9 and 5.10). In fact, initial void ratios were similar for all
specimens, thus results were likely to not vary noticeably due to moduli nor-

identical power laws obtained from previous one. In addition, scatter is not re-
duced significantly. From results obtained, one may conclude that for the same
void ratio and under the same total mean stress, there is a general increase
in shear modulus when the water content decreases in the range of 2% wet of
optimum and 4% dry of optimum.

tigate these differences, in Figure 5.21 is illustrated the ratio between average
S–waves velocity determined with accelerometers and BE and corresponding
standard deviation. With exception to results obtained from wOPM+2% unsatu-
rated specimen, ratio VAc/VBE was lower than 5%, which denotes good agree-
ment between S–waves velocity determined with both sensors. This difference
corresponds to a variation of shear modulus lower than 10%.

confining stress, which is the same to say as specimens stiffens. Attempting
to understand these differences, determination of S–waves velocity earn to be
investigated. Hence, in Figure 5.22 are presented examples of travel time de-
termination corresponding to different confining stresses, 100 and 200 kPa. One

Figure 5.22: Time travel determination with with accelerometers and BE dur-

can see from Figure 5.22a that arrival time from both accelerometers is straight,
whereas picking BE arrival point is ambiguous. This difficulty, probably due to
nearfield effects amplified by a high degree of saturation, led to pick the wrong
arrival time, thus to mislead computation of S–wave velocity.

On the other hand, for the remain confining stress stages (200 and 300 kPa),
determination of BE arrival time was clear, as illustrated in Figure 5.22b and,
thereby, differences became smaller. This is thought to be due to the a decrease
on saturation degree, since water expelling through the draining system was ob-
served during test. After test had finished moisture content was determined and
this hypothesis was confirmed since a moisture content of 8.9% was found, which
is close to the optimum water content. Indeed, computed shear modulus at these
stages were quite similar to the corresponding values from wOPM specimen, as
seen previously in Figure 5.20b. In conclusion, travel time determination using
accelerometers is unambiguous whatever material state condition.

5.5 Conclusions

In this chapter, the most relevant laboratory test results obtained from test-
ing of clayey sand (SC) and crushed aggregate (CA31.5) materials were pre-
sented. Results were divided according to the characterization type, namely,
physical, hydro and mechanical characterization. Emphasis was given to me-
chanical characterization, particularly in what concerns to SC material.

Only SC was submitted to hydro characterization. The filter paper technique
was employed to measure matric suction on specimens compacted with same
initial void ratio but varying molding water contents. Matric suction decreased
with increasing saturation degree, ie.e, with increasing molding water content.
Tests showed good repeatability and, thereby, filter paper technique proved to
be an easy and low cost method to determine water retention curve.

Mechanical characterization involved oedometer test, triaxial tests and tri-
axial tests with measurement of S–waves velocity. SC specimens with varying
molding water content both in unsaturated and saturated conditions were sub-



Conclusions 129

mitted to oedometer tests. In the lower stress range, before yielding, the curves
shapes are reasonably molding water content independent, thus suction inde-
pendent. On the contrary, in the higher stress range after yielding, curves
shapes from unsaturated specimens seems to be suction dependent. The data
confirm the general findings that an increased suction produces a stiffening of
the material with smaller plastic compressibility (Alonso et al., 1990; Cui and
Delage, 1996), despite the tight differences observed between unsaturated tests.
Saturated test (zero suction) showed the lowest compressibility which was due
to a lower initial void ratio. Hence, similar results are produced by variation of
suction and density, since any increase in either of these parameters reduces the
compressibility. Regarding unloading cycle, it appears that swelling is suction
independent for unsaturated specimens.

Both materials were subjected to triaxial tests. As far as what concerns to
SC, drained saturated and unsaturated multistage triaxial tests were performed
on specimens compacted with the same initial void ratio and with molding
water contents ranging from 4% dry of optimum to 2% wet of optimum. A
strong influence of molding water content on the mechanical behaviour of SC
material was found, namely regarding strength and deformability parameters,
which is attributed to suction effect. However, suction effect decreases with
increasing stress and strain levels.

A stress–strain non linear behaviour featuring material in a dense state was
observed from all specimens. Specimens with lower molding water content de-
noted higher britleness behaviour, corresponding higher secant friction angles.
However, differences become lower with increasing total mean stress level with
specimens with lower molding water content presenting higher reduction of se-
cant friction angles. Moreover, at higher total mean stress ?sec values get closer
and seems to tend to ?sec value at critical state, which is consistent with de Beer
(1965) investigations on granular materials in a dense state. Critical state had
been reached in unsaturated and saturated tests and a similar ?cs was found
(34.1?), which means that material behaviour at critical state is independent of
initial saturation condition.

Specimens deformability were investigated regarding strain levels 0.5 and
1% and, likewise, identical trends were found. Higher Esec feature specimens
compacted dry of optimum. As specimen molding water content approaches
saturated condition Esec decreases.. However, differences regarding strain level
1% are smaller reflecting the influence of strain level. In addition, Esec relation
for 0.5 and 1% strain level appears to be fairly constant as moisture increases
beyond optimum value for both stress levels, corresponding to about 1.7, which
is quite similar to relation given by Ishibashi and Zhang (1993). In what con-
cerns to specimens with lower moisture content, i.e, higher suction, relation
tends to increase and becomes more pronounced for lower stress levels, which
is the same to say that as stress level increases there is a reduction of suction
effect on deformability. Further, degradation curves were found to lie between a
reference threshold shear strain given by Santos (1999). The influence of mois-
ture content, i.e., suction, on normalized degradation curves confining stress is
clearly marked. As confining stress increases, differences between degradation
curves become smaller. Therefore, as seen previously, as stress level increases
there is a reduction of suction effect on deformability.

Multistage procedure was found to provide good results regarding peak de-
viatoric stresses, as long as no significant structure disturbance is experimented

at each stage. However, stress–strain curves present higher britleness behaviour
rather than triaxial single stage tests. In addition, similar anisotropic and
isotropic compression lines regarding wOPM and wOPM iso saturated and un-
saturated tests, respectively, were obtained. These results reflect low influence
of anisotropy induced by multistage triaxial tests. Further, it was interesting
noting that slopes (?) of unsaturated samples increase with increasing water
content, thus confirms a decreasing compressibility, as verified in oedometer
tests.

Likewise to SC material, also saturated and unsaturated multistage triaxial
tests were performed on CA31.5 specimens compacted with the same initial void
ratio and with molding water contents of 2% dry of optimum and optimum,
aiming to investigate the influence of molding water content on strenght and
deformability. In addition, a dry test was carried out.

A stress–strain non linear behaviour featuring material in a dense state was
observed from all specimens. Unsaturated specimens denoted higher britleness
behaviour, corresponding higher secant friction angles. However, in contrast to
SC material, specimen with optimum molding water content presented the high-
est friction angle and saturated specimens the lowest. Once again, differences
become lower with increasing total mean stress level and at higher total mean
stress ?sec values get closer. Critical state had been reached only for saturated
tests where a ?cs = 40.8

? was obtained. As so, little differences on samples
strength were found whether from saturated or unsaturated samples, which in-
dicates little influence of suction effect on strength in the range of molding water
content studied.

The influence of compaction conditions on specimens deformability was in-
vestigated regarding strain levels 0.5 and 1%. No significant differences on
specimens deformability were found for strain and stress levels evaluated. To
this end, suction seems not to play an important role on CA31.5 material stiff-
ness for the studied compaction conditions. In addition, Esec relation for 0.5
and 1% strain level appears to be fairly constant corresponding to about 1.75,
which is quite similar to relation obtained from SC material.

The very small strains properties of SC were determined from measurements
of S–waves velocity with bender elements and accelerometers. Tests were carried
out on specimens with the same initial conditions as for triaxial tests. Measure-
ments were performed at isotropic and anisotropic states. Once again, molding
water content strongly influences material stiffness at very small strains. Like-
wise to conventional triaxial tests, stiffness decreased with increasing molding
water content exhibiting, thereby, suction effect. Moreover, at lower stress levels
differences tend to be higher.

As far as what concerns to comparison between results obtained using BE
and accelerometers, generally, results obtained with both sensors slightly differs,
with exception to the specimen with higher moisture content. The investiga-
tion of travel time determination showed that picking arrival time from both
accelerometers is straight, whereas picking BE arrival point is ambiguous. This
difficulty, probably due to near–field effects amplified by a high degree of sat-
uration, led to pick the wrong arrival time, thus to mislead computation of
S–wave velocity. Therefore, the measurement of S–waves using accelerometers
as receivers appears to improve measurements quality in the time domain, par-
ticularly concerning quasi–saturated specimens.



Chapter 6

Field investigation: E?vora
trial railway embankment
(ETRE)

6.1 Introduction

The current field quality control/quality assurance (Qc/Qa) of road and rail-
way embankments construction requires materials and compacted layers evalu-
ation and comparison with design parameters, that were accessed either by in
situ prospection and/or by laboratory tests.

Recently, there is a strong trend towards using stiffness and strength to con-
trol compaction rather than index parameters given the importance of these
mechanistic properties in pavement materials evaluation (Briaud, 2001; Loizos
et al., 2003; Alshibli et al., 2005; Edil and Sawangsurya, 2005). In this scope,
the static plate loadind test (SPLT) has been used in Portugal as a reference
test either for evaluation of layers deformability and as reference test for per-
formance related tests. However, the lack of a national SPLT standard for the
application on road and railways embankments led constructors to use European
standards, specifically, DIN 18134 (2001) and AFNOR NF P94–117–1 (2000).
This notwithstanding, these standards differ in the test procedure and method
for determination of E modulus. Therefore, evaluation of these standards is
required in order to, on one hand, allow comparison of results and definition
of standard to be used and, on the other hand, to provide a contribution for
the European standardisation of SPLT. Further, performance related tests that
have been recently developed, namely, impact tests (falling weight deflectometer
– FWD and light falling weight deflectometer – LFWD), the soil stiffness gauge
(SSG) and spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW), and continuous com-
paction control test methods (Portanceme?tre), involve different test methods
which are not standardised and, therefore, it demands their in situ calibration
for different materials and state conditions using SPLT as reference test.

A full scale trial was performed on a railway embankment aiming to study
the influence of compaction conditions on the mechanical behaviour of com-
pacted layers constructed using two geomaterials, a clayey sand (SC) and a

131



132 Field investigation: ETRE

crushed aggregate (CA31.5), which were employed in railway embankment and
railway track layers, respectively. To this end, SC layers were compacted em-
ploying different thicknesses (0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m), and different water con-
tents regarding Modified Proctor (optimum -2%, optimum and optimum +2%),
whereas CA31.5 layers were compacted employing different thicknesses (0.22
and 0.30 m), yet with same water content (optimum Modified Proctor). Index
parameters and mechanical properties were then evaluated for several energy
levels corresponding to 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 passes of the vibrating roller.

In this chapter, firstly, index parameters (density, ?, and moisture content,
w) obtained from SCM and NM are presented and directly compared. Secondly,
results obtained from SPLT following AFNOR NF P94–117–1 (2000) standard
and using two different measuring systems are evaluated. Then, comparison
with corresponding results obtained from SPLT following DIN 18134 (2001) is
conducted. Following, SPLT is used as reference test and comparison with
performance related tests is established . Then analysis of full scale trial results
is conducted and recommendations are provided. At last, comparison between
field and laboratory results is performed.

6.2 State conditions

The sand cone method (SCM) and nuclear method (NM) provide state pa-
rameters, namely, density (?) and water content (w). The interpretation of both
tests is straight. However, it should be noted that NM involved measurements
on the same spot at depths of 0, 0.06 and 0.12 m, which were then averaged.

Although SCM enable a direct measurement of density and the direct mea-
surement of moisture content through oven drying method (NP 84, 1965), values
obtained from NM results from an indirect measure. Hence, values obtained
from NM requires calibration with corresponding measures from SCM and oven
drying method. In order to establish a relationship between test methods, re-
lationship between density (?) and volumetric water content (?) is shown in
Figures 6.1 and 6.2.

Figure 6.2: Comparison of average state parameters per layer obtained from
NM and SCM test methods: (a) density; (b) volumetric water content

Though measures carried out on CA31.5 are plotted no correlation between
test methods is established due to lack of results. Thereby, results are corrected
accordingly individual relationships between average values.

Firstly, in Figure 6.1 only values obtained from tests carried out on the same
grid are included and grid homogeneity is assumed. Even though a poor re-
lationship between density was obtained due to high scatter, values gathered
from SCM are slightly higher. On the contrary, a good relationship between
volumetric water content was reached, where a R2 of 0.76 was obtained. Due
to high scatter from density results, secondly, a relationship between average
values per energy level for each layer was attempted. In Figure 6.2 one can see
reasonable and good relationships for density (R2 = 0.70) and volumetric water
content (R2 = 0.87), respectively. Hence, values obtained from NM were cali-
brated accordingly to expressions in Figure 6.2 and will be employed hereafter.
The result of calibration is presented in Figure 6.3.

Desirable moisture content was achieved for 0.30 and 0.50 m layers compacted
with moisture content 2% dry of optimum. Remaining layers present great
scatter despite the fact that material had been subject to a process to make
it homogeneous previously to its application, as described in Chapter 4. To



State conditions 135

some extent this may be attributed to the weather conditions during these
layers construction. Concerning to SCM tests results (fig. 6.4), the lowest
dry density was obtained on 0.50 m wOPM?2% layer which lied below the 97%
Proctor Modified limit, whereas for the remain layers this limit seems to be
achieved at the last energy level (12 passes). With regards to NM tests results,
high scatter is verified. This notwithstanding, the great number of tests allows
to see that there is a gradual shift of optimum moisture content to the left,
which means that wOPM decreases with increasing energy level, as would be
expected.

In Figure 6.5 data from SCM and NM tests carried out on CA31.5 layers are
illustrated. Due to time constraints SCM was performed only for one energy
level. The analysis of NM calibrated results for all energy levels demonstrate
an increasing ?d with increasing energy exceeding maximum dry density given
by Modified Proctor. Concerning to moisture content, w, an increase about 2%
between the first and last energy levels is observed. This propably was due to
weather conditions, which were adverse during runing tests on these trial layers.
Nevertheless, for the last energy level moisture content is close to optimum value
from Modified Proctor.

Since an extensive mechanical characterization was performed for the last
energy level (12 passes), focus is given to layers state conditions at this stage.
In Tables 6.1 and 6.2 is given statistical data regarding SC and CA31.5 trial
layers, respectively. In what concerns to the former layers constructed with 2%
dry of optimum, the desirable moisture content was achieved only for layers
with 0.30 and 0.50 m thickness, which average value was about 2.5–3% dry of
optimum. With regards to dry density a higher average value was reached for
layer with 0.30 m thickness, which is close to 98% of Modified Proctor, whereas
average dry density for 0.50 m layer was close to 94%. These results denote
the influence of layer thickness on dry density regarding compaction equipment
used.

dry of optimum and an average dry density corresponding to 95% of Modified
Proctor was achieved for the last energy level.

Concerning to remaining SC layers with 0.40 m, though different moisture
contents were attempted, 2% dry of otpimum and 2% wet of optimum, an
identical moisture content was reached on both layers, which was about 1.5%
wet of optimum value. Dry density close to 96% of optimum Modified Proctor

was achieved on both layers.
Finally, in what concerns to state conditions of CA31.5 layers for the last

energy level, moisture content around optimum value given by Modified Proctor
was achieved for layer with 0.30 m thickness, whereas a moisture content 1%
wet of optimum was achieved on layer with 0.22 m thickness. The average dry
density was identical for both layers which average value is around 106% of
maximum value given by Modified Proctor.

To sum up, it appears that the previous stack of material, water adding and
mix up by means of a front shovel did not reproduced the desirable moisture
content. The adverse weather conditions during running tests may have partially
contributed to moisture content mismatch.

6.3 Moduli from SPLT

A total of 112 SPLT were performed on full scale trial. These were car-
ried out following both AFNOR NF P94–117–1 (2000) and DIN 18134 (2001)
standards, corresponding to 78 and 34 tests, respectively, yet the latter were
performed only for the last energy level at each layer, as listed in section 4.3.
Regarding running tests following AFNOR standard, two settlement measure-
ment systems were used at the same time: one measuring settlement at the
center and another measuring settlement in three concentric points on periph-
ery of the loading plate. For this reason, results obtained following AFNOR
standard will be differentiated accordingly the settlement measuring system.
Only one settlement measurement system measuring at the center of the load-
ing plate was used on tests conducted following DIN standard. Statistical data
(average, standard deviation, SD, and coefficient of variation, CV) obtained
from SPLT is given in Appendix C. The individual tests results were reported
in Gomes Correia et al. (2006).

6.3.1 Comparison of SPLT results following AFNOR stan-
dard and using different settlement measuring sys-
tems

The analysis of the SPLT results denoted noticeable differences between
EV2 values obtained with AFNOR standard, using different measuring systems.
The detail analysis of tests results at the beginning of the running tests showed



138 Field investigation: ETRE

differences in the range of 90% between settlement measurements of the loading
plate using the two measuring systems. Thus, the settlement of the supports
of the three point measuring system and the settlement of the structure were
assessed attempting to justify these differences. However, it was found out
insignificant support settlement (?s) in such a way to affect the measurement
of the settlement of the loading plate (?lp). These measurements are illustrated
in Figure 6.6, which shows a maximum settlement of one support of 0.012 mm
( ?s

Accordingly to standard AFNOR NF P94–117–1 (2000) the loading plate
may contain a hole in its center with 2 cm diameter. The measuring system is
placed in such a way that measures the settlement of the material being tested
through this hole. Hence, a punching phenomenon caused by the hole was set
as hypothesis. In order to investigate this hypothesis, a running test where
was verified a significant difference between the two measuring systems (three
point and the one point through the hole) was chosen and a third loading cycle
was carried out. In this third loading cycle the one point measuring system

was placed in contact with the loading plate approximately 2 cm away from the
center. The load–settlement curve is presented in Figure 6.7.

Assuming a rigid loading plate, the settlement measured with the one point
measuring system placed on the loading plate approximately 2 cm away from
the center and the three point measuring system should be the same. Though
in this case it differs approximately 10% (see Table 6.3), which is thought to be
an acceptable difference.

suring system, through the hole in the center (second loading cycle) or on the

Furthermore, it should be pointed out the difference between the settlement
measured with the three point measuring system between second and third
loading cycles that is 3.4%. In the same way, a difference in the same range
between settlemen measured with the one point measuring system, through the
hole in the center (second loading cycle) or on the loading plate 2 cm away from
the center (third loading cycle), should be similar. However, a difference of
80% is verified. As a result, measurement through the hole in the center of the
loading plate appears to exhibit a punching phenomenon, which might explain
the differences mentioned above. Hence, the measurement of the settlement with
one point measuring system should be performed on the center of the loading
plate instead through the hole in the center in contact with the material being
tested.

The analysis of the whole SPLT following AFNOR standard, where the two



140 Field investigation: ETRE

settlement measuring systems were used at the same time, allows to conclude
that EV2 modulus obtained with one point measuring system through the hole
in the center of the loading plate is approximately 30% higher than the corre-
sponding value obtained with the three point measuring system, as illustrated
in Figure 6.8. Therefore, test result using the three point measuring system is
considered as the reference value hereafter.

6.3.2 Comparison of EV2 modulus following standards:
AFNOR NF P94–117–1 (2000) and DIN 18134 (2001)

The SPLT has been carried out in most different engineering works, above
all following AFNOR NF P94–117–1 (2000) and DIN 18134 (2001) standards.
Differences between these standards are twofold: (i) test proceed; (ii) test inter-
pretation, which are reflected on the final elastic modulus obtained. Taking into
account the importance that this parameter assumes on quality control of em-
bankments layers, comparison between values obtained following each standard
was conducted. With this purpose, experimental plan provided SPLT performed
following AFNOR NF P94–117–1 (2000) and DIN 18134 (2001) standards on all
trial layers for the last energy level, corresponding to 12 passes of the vibrating
roller.

For the sake of the interpretation and comparison of SPLT, some issues
must be pointed out. First, SPLT were performed in different grids (5×2 m2)
on trial layers 0.30 wOPM?2%, 0.40 wOPM?2%, 0.50 wOPM?2% and 0.40 wOPM.
Second, SPLT were conducted in same grids (5×2 m2) on remaining trial layers,
namely, 0.40 wOPM+2%, 0.22 wOPM and 0.30 wOPM. Finally, with exception to
tests performed on trial layers 0.50 wOPM?2% and 0.30 wOPM?2%, all the other
ones were performed in the same day. Table 6.4 sum up these issues.

Comparison of EV2 modulus obtained from SPLT direct interpretation
of standards

Results obtained from SPLT carried out in the same grid (5×2 m2) were
compared assuming homogeneity of state parameters per grid. For this reason,

it is believed that correlations presented are independent from state parameters
of each layer and, therefore, results from all layers were compared together.

Comparison of EV2 modulus obtained from direct interpretation of SPLT
following both standards is presented in Figure 6.9a. One can see that EV2
modulus obtained from direct interpretation of SPLT following DIN standard
is about 15% higher than corresponding values obtained from SPLT following
AFNOR standard. An acceptable correlation is verified (R2 = 0.69).

On the assumption of homogeinity of state parameters, comparison between
the average values of EV2 per layer was carried out. In Figure 6.9b are plot-
ted the EV2 average values resulting from direct interpretation of five SPLTs
following each standard. Average values of EV2 obtained from direct interpre-
tation of SPLT following DIN standard are 11% higher than the corresponding
values obtained following AFNOR standard, which is similar to the one verified
for comparison of tests performed in the same grid. Thereby, the assumptions
about homogeneity of state parameters per layer are validated by this correla-
tion. Note that a good correlation is verified (R2 = 0.83).

Comparison of EV2 modulus obtained from SPLT interpretation for
the same normal stress and method

As mentioned previously, AFNOR and DIN standards differs on test proce-
dure and on test interpretation. Herein, focus will be given to the latter. Two
main differences on the interpretation method must be highlight: (i) the normal
stress below the plate for which EV2 is calculated; (ii) the method for determi-
nation of plate settlement (recall Chapter 2). On one hand, interpretation of
SPLT following AFNOR standard is performed for a normal stress below the
plate of 200 kPa and using secant method for settlement determination. On
the other hand, interpretation of SPLT following DIN standard is performed
for a normal stress below the plate of 250 kPa and using tangent method for
settlement determination.

Regarding non–linear stress–strain behaviour of geomaterials, comparison
of EV2 modulus should be carried for the same normal stress and using same
method for settlement determination (secant or tangent). Hence, a normal
stress of 200 kPa and secant method was set as reference for the interpretation
of SPLTs. This option was limited by AFNOR standard procedure which deter-
mines a maximum normal stress below the plate of 200 kPa during the second
loading cycle and only allows the secant method to be used. In the same manner
as previously presented, in Figure 6.10 are plotted the EV2 modulus obtained
from tests carried out in the same grid and average values per layer. One can
see that differences decreases when interpretation for the same normal stress
(200 kPa) and same method (secant) is conducted. EV2 modulus obtained from
tests following DIN procedure are about 10% or 15% lower than corresponding
values obtained from tests following AFNOR standard, either when comparison
is made between tests done in the same grid (fig. 6.10a) or between average
values per layer (fig. 6.10b), respectively. Once again, acceptable and good
correlations are testified by values of R2 equal to 0.68 and 0.81.

In conclusion, from straight interpretation of SPLT following both standards
or even when interpretation for same normal stress (200 kPa) and same method
(secant) is performed, slightly differences are observed. Therefore, for the stud-



Moduli from SPLT 143

ied geomaterials and state parameters, results suggests that test procedure does
not have significant influence on value of EV2 modulus.

Comparison of EV2 modulus obtained from SPLT back–analysis

So far SPLT have been compared based on straight interpretation of stan-
dards or for same normal stress and method. However, it mus be pointed out
that difference of plate dimension was not considered, which may influence the
interpretation undertaken.

As mentioned on Chapter 2, SPLT plate with 600 mm in diameter was used
for SPLT following AFNOR standard, whereas a plate with 300 mm in diameter
was used for SPLT following DIN standard. It is well recognised that the “pres-
sure bulb” below a circular footing extends to a depth equal to about twice the
diameter of the footing. Thus, different “pressure bulbs” are associated to each
plate. Consequently, in a multi–layer system EV2 modulus per layer must be
determined to allow to compare values independently of standard used. Oth-
erwise, only comparison of equivalent EV2 modulus is possible. To this end,
back–analysis of SPLT was carried out. This analysis was based on the Theory
of Elasticity and on Boussinesq solution for a rigid circular footing with diame-
ter B loaded by force Q, resting on a linear elastic medium with elastic modulus
E and Poisson ratio ?, as expressed in Equation 6.1.

(6.3)

In order to determine E modulus from back–analysis, a numerical model was
implemented using a finite element commercial program (TNO, 2005) and an
axisymmetric model was used. The methodology for back–analysis calculations
consisted in three phases.

In the first phase rigidity of plates was evaluated. With this purpose,
AFNOR and DIN plate (recall Chapter 2) were modeled, the latter considering
three thicknesses 21 (plate used in situ tests), 50 and 150 mm. In addition,
a uniform load applied directly over foundation was modeled in order to con-
firm Irig given by analytical expressions (Poulos and Davis, 1974). SPLTs were
modeled with concentric static linear load applied on plates and a wide range
of foundation modulus (0–400 MPa) was considered. A Poisson ratio ? = 0.20
was employed. From the input load and modulus and output settlement the
Irig was determined. Results obtained are shown in Figure 6.11. From analysis
of Figure 6.11 it can be concluded that AFNOR plate behaves as rigid plate.
However, the value of Irig is lower than theoretical value, 1.51. An interesting
behaviour regarding DIN plate 21 mm is observed. For low values of E modulus



144 Field investigation: ETRE

plate behaves as rigid plate, while for high values of E modulus plate behaves
towards flexible plate since Irig becomes closer to the theoretical value for flex-
ible plate, 1.9 (Poulos and Davis, 1974). In order to check minimum thickness
for DIN plate to behave as rigid plate, thicknesses equal to 50 and 150 mm were
studied. Behaviour as rigid plate was verified for both thicknesses. To sum up,
concerning plates used in field tests, both plates behaves as rigid plate within the
interval range of interest, i.e., for values of E modulus given by in situ SPLTs.

The second phase consisted on the validation of numerical analysis. With
this purpose, numerical modeling of SPLT was conducted to verify relationship
between EV2 given by the interpretation of both standards for the same normal
stress, 200 kPa, which results are plloted in Figure 6.12. Relationship between
EV2 is identical to the one obtained by comparison of interpretation of SPLT
results for the same stress and method (see fig. 6.10). Although Irig of plates
given by numerical models are not the same given by standards, it can be ob-
served negligible influence on relationship established, thus validating numerical
modeling.

adopted is presented in Figure 6.13. Equivalent modulus EV2 EQ was calculated
in first place and, further, EV2 modulus of overlying layers were determined
in a back–analysis process. The obtained results are shown in Figure 6.14. A
relationship close to unit between computed values can be seen. A reasonable
correlation is exhibited by a R2 equal to 0.44. Since a relationship close to unit
was obtained, one may conclude that plate diameter had slightly influence on
the result of studied cases. Nevertheless, for multi–layered system, comparison
of EV2 modulus obtained from SPLTs using different plates can only be made
by conversion of values for a certain layer with a certain thickness.

To sum up, comparison between test results following AFNOR and DIN
standards should take into account the stress level and method on test interpre-
tation. Furthermore, the plate diameter and plate coefficient of rigidity should
be taken into account on determination of equivalent modulus. In addition,
SPLT carried out accordingly AFNOR NF P94–117–1 (2000) should be carried
out using a measuring system that directly measures the plate settlement either
using a three point or one point measuring system. These recommendations
led to a specification project of SPLT (Gomes Correia et al., 2007) which is
presented in Appendix B.

6.4 Moduli obtained from performance related

tests

6.4.1 LFWD, FWD, SSG and Portanceme?tre

The LFWD, SSG and Portanceme?tre devices promptly provide ELFWD, ESSG
and EPort moduli, respectively. In Appendix C is given statistical data (average
and standard deviation, SD, and coefficient of variation, CV) obtained with
these test methods for each trial layer and for several energy levels. The number
of tests enabling statistic treatment by layer and energy level were listed in
Chapter 4 and individual tests results were reported in Caldeira (2006).

The FWD device provide maximum deflection from which modulus EFWD
can be computed promptly too. All tests were conducted starting with one
seating load followed by one load drop at four different drop heights, generating
this way four different loads, in each station. A load plate with 0.30 m in
diameter was used and a flexible load plate was considered. In Appendix C is
given statistical data.

It should be bear in mind that Portanceme?tre is the only continuous test
method enabling, therefore, an enhanced characterization of mechanical prop-
erties of compacted layers. In fact, while 2 or 4 LFWD and SSG tests were
performed at each lane A, B or C (recall section 4.3), the total length was
evaluated with Portanceme?tre since it gathers one test per meter. This im-
provement is highlighted in Figure 6.15 showing the evaluation of mechanical
properties with the number of passes, corresponding to layer 0.30 m wOPM?2%,
lane B.

6.4.2 SASW

The SASW test carried out requires further analysis to provide desirable
modulus. In what follows is presented the setup and the interpretation of SASW
tests carried out on 0.40 wOPM compacted layer.



Moduli obtained from performance related tests 147

The setup involved the instrumentation of surface layer with accelerometers
placed at equidistant distances. Four vertical receivers (accelerometers) are
placed on the ground at an equal distance from a fixed centerline. Because the
upper compacted layer of about 0.40 m and foundation layer of about 0.60 m are
under consideration, receivers spacing of 1 m is used in this study. The setup
adopted is illustrated in Figure 6.16.

Figure 6.16: Setup adopted to perform SASW on layer 0.40 wOPM inside grid
B6

Two tests were performed, one was carried out inside grid 5–6, lane B,
whereas another was performed inside grid 8–9, also inside lane B. An impulsive
load is applied in line with the receivers at a distance away from the receiver
equal to receivers spacing. To improve the signal–to–noise ratio, the impacts are
repeated several times (about 20 impacts). A reverse test is also performed with
the source in the opposite side of the receiver array, in order to confirm the first
test. Active Rayleigh wave data were generated using a light hammer source.
The typical waveforms of signals generated using a light hammer source and its
spectrum is presented in Figure 6.17. As illustrated in Figure 6.17, these active
sources generate high–frequency Rayleigh waves in the range of 10–500Hz.

an acquisition program developed in LabVIEW. An acquisition system National
Instruments SCXI 1600 with accelerometers card 1531, with a maximum sam-
pling rate of 200 kS per second and a resolution of 16 bits was used to collect the
signals from both the source and the receiving accelerometers. Data acquisition
was performed at a frequency of 2 kHz per channel (?t = 0.0005 s).

Results from test inside grid B6

Considering each pair of signals, one pair involving receivers 1 and 2 with one
meter spacing, and another involving receivers 2 and 4 with two meters spacing,
an estimate of the dispersion curve over a certain frequency range is obtained
considering filtering criterion, as described in Chapter 2. Assembling the in-
formation from the different pairs of receivers the composite dispersion curve
is obtained (fig. 6.18). Since the experimental dispersion curve correspond-
ing to the revere test spans a short range of frequency, data was discarded.
Then a polynomial regression was attempted, however regression showed a low
coefficient of determination. Therefore, original data was adopted.

The shear wave profile was computed using an iterative process described
previously. The inversion is performed in different stages where a soil profile
with an increasing number of layers is used. Table 6.5 gives these values for all
stages, as well as the square root of the final value of the objective function.

The lowest value of the square root of the objective function was achieved
for the shear wave profile corresponding to an earth model with two layers
over halfspace (stage 3). From Table 6.5 it can be seen that layers thicknesses
mismatch the actual profile, since the trial layer with thickness of 0.40 m lies on
a foundation with thickness of 0.60 m.

Then, a new shear wave profile was computed using all data available for
the trial layer and foundation layer. To this end, state conditions obtained on

6.6. Once again the lowest value of f

obj was obtained for an earth model with

two layers over halfspace, yet is higher than the one obtained in Table 6.5.
This notwithstanding, good agreement between theoretical and experimental
composite dispersion curves (fig. 6.19) is verified. From the shear wave profile
Young modulus can be computed accordingly the following equation 6.4, which
results in ESASW = 185 MPa.

Likewise the previous test, the experimental dispersion curve was computed
using the same pairs of signals and filtering criterion and is shown in Figure 6.20.
Since the number of points in the composite dispersion curve is not manageable
for the successive inversion process, a polynomial regression was adopted.

The same interpretation method was applied. The inversion is performed in
different stages where a soil profile with an increasing number of layers is used.

of 0.56 m and 0.46 m, thus mismatching the actual field profile. However, it is
interesting noting that profile obtained on stage 3 is close to the actual profile,
since the trial layer with thickness of 0.40 m lies on a foundation with thickness
of 0.60 m.

Then, a new shear wave profile was computed using all data available for
the trial layer and foundation layer. To this end, state conditions obtained
on the closest grid (B10) were employed. The results found out are given in

Table 6.20. The value of f

obj on stage 2 demonstrates good agreement between

theoretical and experimental dispersion curves (fig. 6.21). From the shear wave
profile Young modulus was computed resulting in ESASW = 130 MPa for the
trial layer. This value is significant lower than the one obtained on grid B6
which reflects the lower density achieved on grid B9.

6.5 Correlation between E modulus for several

tests

As previously described, several tests for determination of E modulus were
performed. In this section, correlation between E modulus obtained from SPLT
test and performance related tests (LFWD, SSG and Portanceme?tre) will be
established. To this end, EV2 modulus from SPLT using three point measuring
system will be set as the reference value, accordingly to conclusions reached on
previous sections.

Before the establishment of correlations, it is important to remind that Por-
tanceme?tre is a continuous test, while the others being spot tests, as aforemen-
tioned. The output of Portanceme?tre is about one value per meter, which means
approximately five values per grid with dimensions 5×2 m2. Therefore, output
was managed in order to enable comparison between values obtained from spot
tests. As so, an average value of EPort modulus per grid value was determined.
In Figure 6.22 the number of original output given by the equipment, aver-
age per grid and computed spacial distribution are illustrated concerning layer
0.30 m wOPM?2% last energy level.

The methodology employed to the establishment of relationships between
SPLT and performance related tests was based is the following steps:

(i) comparison between tests results performed in the same spot for all energy
levels;

(ii) comparison between tests results performed in the same grid for all energy
levels;

(iii) comparison between average values per energy level grouped into homoge-
neous areas given by Portanceme?tre;

(iv) comparison between average values per energy level;

(v) perform previous iterations, yet only considering the last energy level (12
passes).

Ever tests results are unavailable or established relationships at each step
show high scatter will not be presented.

Owing to the third step, homogeneous areas were defined by averaging Por-
tanceme?tre modulus in each 5×2 m2 grid into groups with intervals within the
range of 10 MPa. For instance, every grid with an average EPort modulus
between 80 and 90 MPa belongs to the same homogeneous area. Spot tests be-
longing to a given homogeneous area were also grouped together and average
was computed. The correlations between Portanceme?tre results and the other
tests were established by comparing the respective average modulus for each ho-
mogeneous area. It is worth noting the fact that output values of Portanceme?tre
results from calibration made at the time of the construction of the new E?vora
railway line. The materials used in the trial embankment were similar to the
ones used in the new railway line. Regarding the last step, it is intended to
establish relationships between tests carried out for an energy level with low
scatter regarding state conditions.

6.5.1 SC trial layers

In first place, relationship between moduli obtained from Portanceme?tre and
SPLT is evaluated. Figure 6.23 show reasonable correlation (R2 = 0.65) close
to unity between EPort and EV2 AFNOR moduli corresponding to average values
per energy level (number of passes of the vibrating roller).

A similar trend is given by relationships between tests results for the last
energy level, as presented in Figure 6.24, yet modulus obtained from Por-
tanceme?tre being slightly higher. Poor correlation (R2 = 0.42) is observed
from relationship established between tests performed in the the same grid for
the last energy level (fig. 6.24a), whereas a reasonable correlation is found from

comparison between average values grouped into homogeneous areas given by
Portanceme?tre (fig. 6.24b). In contrast, comparison between average values
noticeably improves correlation where a R2 = 0.97 is obtained (fig. 6.24c). It
is noteworthy that correlations present reduced scatter at the last energy level,
which denotes greater homogeneity of mechanical properties. Note that the cal-
ibration of Portanceme?tre is corroborated by this results, despite the fact that
Portanceme?tre modulus being overestimated for values higher than 110 MPa.

In second place, LFWD results are compared with reference test SPLT. In
Figure 6.25a is plotted the EV2 AFNOR against ELFWD modulus for tests pre-
formed in the same spot and for several energy levels. Despite high scatter
(R2 = 0.29), a correlation between moduli close to unity is verified. The eval-
uation of the relationship between average moduli per energy level show an
identical trend, but higher scatter is associated (R2 = 0.26), as illustrated in
Figure 6.25b.

Further, in Figure 6.26 is shown the correlations established for the last
energy level. Identical trends are verified for both values grouped into homo-
geneous areas and average values, yet an enhanced correlations are observed,
which means reduced scatter at this energy level. Likewise to previous results,
it is noteworthy that coefficient of determination is higher regarding average
values per energy level (R2 = 0.64). It should be noted that correlation close to
unity was obtained.

In third place, relationship between moduli obtained from SSG and SPLT
is shown in Figure 6.27. Although higher scatter is observed for average val-
ues per energy level (fig. 6.27a), ESSG modulus is found to be approximately
34% higher than EV2 AFNOR. An identical trend is obtained from relationship
between average values for the last energy level (fig. 6.27b), yet with slightly
reduced scatter (R2 = 0.41).

Finally, moduli obtained from FWD and SASW are analyzed. Concerning
the former, since tests were carried out only for layer 0.40 m wOPM for the
last energy level, average EFWD modulus is compared with corresponding value
obtained from reference test. As so, average modulus corresponding to the
first drop (EFWD = 191.9) is about 2.5 times EV2 AFNOR. With regards to
SASW, two tests were performed on trial layer 0.40 wOPM, on grids B6 and B9,

6.6.1 SC trial layers

The evolution of mechanical properties with increasing energy level and with
state conditions will be evaluated herein. To this end, correlations found previ-
ously will be employed ever R2 &gt; 0.70, which means only Portanceme?tre results
will be used.

In Figures 6.28 and 6.29 are plotted moduli, obtained from SPLT and Por-
tanceme?tre (after calibration), and state parameters, obtained from SCM and
NM (after calibration), against the number of passes for SC layers constructed
with moisture content close to 2% dry of optimum. Maximum relative com-
paction is reached for 12 passes for both layers, yet 0.30 m trial layer presents
fairly higher average relative compaction than 0.50 m trial layer.

Figure 6.28: 0.30 m wOPM?2% layer moduli EPort, relative compaction and mois-

With regards to trial layer with 0.30 m thickness, maximum relative com-
paction is reached for the last energy level. Focusing on the analysis of moduli
and relative compaction, an increase of both parameters with increasing num-
ber of passes is verified. On the other hand, in Figure 6.28b one can see that
moisture content remains fairly constant. These trends appears to denote the
influence of dry density on mechanical performance concerning to the same mois-
ture content. However, analysis of results obtained on trial layer with 0.50 m
thickness with similar moisture content is not so straight. In Figure 6.29a one
can see that moduli fairly increases with increasing energy level, yet relative
compaction slightly varies. As so, in contrast to aforementioned conclusion, un-
noticeable influence of dry density on moduli is found. Taking into account dry

density high scatter on trial layer with 0.50 m thickness, results must be treated
with caution.

As mentioned previously, moisture content achieved on SC layers with 0.40 m
thickness were close to 0.5% dry of optimum and 1.5% wet of optimum. In Fig-
ures 6.30, 6.31 and 6.32 is presented the evolution of moduli, relative compaction
and moisture content deviation with number of passes. Maximum relative com-
paction is achieved at 8 passes for trial layers 0.40 m, wOPM?2% and 0.40 m,
wOPM, whereas only at 10 passes maximum relative compaction is achieved
for trial layer 0.40 m, wOPM+2%. Concerning to 0.40 m trial layer with lower
moisture content (fig. 6.30), one can see that state parameters do not vary
significantly with increasing energy level, but moduli seems to increase. As so,
relationship between moduli and state parameters can not be established. On
the contrary, moduli and relative compaction appears to be related on trial lay-
ers with moisture content 1.5% wet of optimum, since both parameters increase
with increasing energy level, as moisture content remains almost constant. This
trend is similar to the one verified for trial layer 0.30 m wOPM?2%.

Further, regarding quality control state parameters and moduli scatter earn
to be commented for last energy level (12 passes). Concerning to SC layers
constructed with 2% dry of optimum, NM statistical data for 0.50 m trial layer
shows the highest state parameters CV, about 14% and 5% regarding mois-
ture content and dry density, respectively. Corresponding values for 0.30 m trial
layer are approximately 9% and 3%, being almost half than values regarding
0.50 m trial layer (see Tables C.1 and C.3 in Appendix A). With regards to
trial layer 0.40 m wOPM, a NM moisture content CV about 13% is associated,
while dry density presents CV close to almost 4%. It is interesting noting that
moisture content CV is almost the double than dry density CV for trial layers
compacted dry of optimum. As so, to some extent it appears that state param-
eters scatter are related. This relation is not observed concerning remaining
layers with 0.40 m thickness and compacted wet of optimum. Dry density CV
of approximately 3% and 2% and moisture content CV of about 9% and 10%,
respectively, were obtained from NM tests carried out on trial layers compacted
wet of optimum. To this end, state parameters CV lie below the maximum

values given by Brandl (1977), 5% for dry density determined by means of NM,
with exception to trial layer 0.50 m wOPM?2%.

The analysis of mechanical properties scatter was based on Portanceme?tre re-
sults (see Table C.13). Trial layers compacted dry of optimum (0.30 m wOPM?2%,
0.50 m wOPM?2% and 0.40 m wOPM) presented identical modulus CV ranging
from 13 to 15%, while trial layers with higher moisture content presented lower
modulus CV, 8 and 10%. As so, moduli CV mainly lie below the required
maximum given by Brandl (1977), which is 25%. It appears that state param-
eters and modulus scatter are related, however it should be noted that 0.30 m
wOPM?2% presented higher modulus scatter, though state parameters scatter
was the lowest.

Further, the influence of state parameters on mechanical performance is in-
vestigated. In Figure 6.33 is plotted moduli and relative compaction against
moisture content deviation for the last energy level (12 passes). The results for
all passes are presented in Figure C.1 in Appendix C.

Figure 6.32: 0.40 m wOPM+2% layer moduli EPort, relative compaction and mois-
ture content deviation evolution with number of passes: (a) Moduli and relative
compaction; (b) Moduli and moisture content deviation

As general conclusion for several energy levels, one can verify that moisture
content strongly influences mechanical performance of compacted layers, i.e.,
modulus increases with decreasing moisture content. As shown in Chapter 5
from laboratory campaign, this influence is attributed to suction effect. On the
contrary, dry density influence on modulus appears to be unnoticeable. The
evolution of modulus and dry density of trial layers with moisture content 3%
dry of optimum and 1.5% wet of optimum seems to, at first sight, highlight this
conclusion. However, these results should be interpreted taking into account
hydro–mechanical behaviour of unsaturated geomaterials. Concerning to trial
layers with moisture content 3% dry of optimum, although dry density from
0.30 m trial layer is higher than corresponding value from 0.50 m trial layer,
modulus is sligthly lower. This phenomena may be due to suction effect. It is
known that suction increases with decreasing void ratio and decreasing satura-
tion degree (see fig. 3.18 from Chapter 3). Since moisture content is similar,
the increase of suction due to a lower saturation degree (lower dry density) can
overlap to the increase of suction due to a lower void ratio (higher dry density).
This phenomena should be testified with further laboratory investigation. In
what concerns to trial layers with moisture content 1.5% wet of optimum, suc-
tion effect is lower and does not seems to explain modulus differences. Instead,
it may be due to a higher moisture content CV.

Taking into account the aforementioned issues, it seems that influence of
state conditions on mechanical properties of compacted requires analysis con-
sidering moisture content and respective suction effect, particularly in what
concerns to layers compacted on dry side of compaction curve. With regards
to 0.30 m wOPM?2% and 0.50 m wOPM?2% layers, similar mechanical properties
and moisture content were obtained, but fairly differences on dry density were
found. This fact indicate that influence of suction on mechanichal properties
prevails rather than influence of dry density.

The influence of CV of state parameters on CV modulus is not clear, as
seen previously. However, as moisture content of compacted layers approaches
optimum value and wet side of compaction curve, modulus CV appears to
decrease too. As so, requirements regarding modulus and state parameters

CV of compacted layers should take into account moisture content.
The analysis of results from full scale trial enabled to come to several con-

clusions. Concerning to state conditions, namely moisture content, desirable
moisture content was not achieved for all trial layers and high scatter was veri-
fied. As so, the previous stack of material, water adding and mix up by means
of a front shovel did not reproduced the desirable homogeneity on moisture con-
tent. The adverse weather conditions during running tests may have partially
contributed to increase scatter.

The evaluation of mechanical properties by means of SPLT following AFNOR
NF P94–117–1 (2000) standard and using different measuring systems showed
significant differences. A three point measuring system or a one point measur-
ing system on the plate should be used rather than one point measuring point
placed on a device that measures layer settlement through a hole on the cen-
ter of the plate. Further, analysis of SPLT following AFNOR NF P94–117–1
(2000) and DIN 18134 (2001) standards showed differences on test procedure
and interpretation, which should be taken into account when comparison be-
tween test results is proceeded. A direct comparison should be performed for
the same stress and method for determination of plate settlement. As men-
tioned previously, these recommendations led to a specification project of SPLT
(Gomes Correia et al., 2007) which is presented in Appendix B.

Furthermore, comparison between SPLT results and performance related
tests allowed to establish correlations and testify equipment calibrations us-
ing SPLT as reference test. Concerning to SC material, a good correlation
between SPLT following AFNOR standard (EV2 AFNOR) and Portanceme?tre
(EPort) moduli was obtained. This results indicate the huge potential of this
equipment on continuous stiffness evaluation on earthwork platforms. In con-
trast, a poor correlation was achieved regarding comparison between SPLT fol-
lowing DIN standard (EV2 DIN) and Portanceme?tre (EPort) moduli. This result
highlight one advantage of using a plate with larger diameter. A correlation
close to unity between SPLT based on the AFNOR standard (EV2) and the
LFWD (ELFWD) moduli was observed, despite data high scatter. The results
from this equipment should be treated with caution.

In conclusion, the experiences performed with different equipments to evalu-
ate moduli showed great benefit using Portanceme?tre, although calibration for



Analysis of full scale trial results and recommendations 161

material being tested is required. The quick execution and the immediate lay-
out of the results, which allows quick intervention whenever the deformability
conditions are not achieved, are great advantages of this equipment. However,
the greatest advantage is to allow continuous evaluation of layers stiffness. Nev-
ertheless, an adequate calibration using SPLT is required. With this purpose, it
is recommended to conduct calibration during execution of trial embankments.

6.6.2 CA31.5 trial layers

Likewise, in Figures 6.34 and 6.35 are plotted moduli, obtained from SPLT
and Portanceme?tre (after calibration), and relative compaction and moisture
content deviation, obtained from SCM and NM (after calibration), against the
number of passes for CA31.5 trial layers. One can see a almost linear increase of
relative compaction with energy level, yet moduli do not follow the same trend.
On the other hand, moisture content present great variation between energy
levels, ranging from 2% dry of optimum to 1% wet of optimum, which may
be partially attributted to adverse weather conditions. This notwithstanding,
moduli appears to follow moisture content variation for both layers regarding
energy levels corresponding to 4 to 10 passes. This trend indicates the great
influence of moisture content on mechanical performance rather than dry den-
sity. Concerning the last energy level, a significant moduli decrease is verified,
though a decrease of moisture content is not observed in the same proportion.
It is noteworthy that modulus reaches the highest value close to optimum water
content. This behaviour agrees with the one found from laboratory tests (recall
Chapter 5), where higher modulus was obtained from specimen with optimum
moisture content than modulus obtained from specimen compacted 2% dry of
optimum.

higher modulus may be associated to higher thickness. A higher number of
points would be require to come to reliable conclusions.

Concerning to state parameters CV for the last energy level, dry density CV
was about 2% for both layers, which fullfil Brandl (1977) requirements for base
layers. Regarding moisture content, CV ranged between 5 and 7%. Concerning
modulus CV from Portanceme?tre, values of 30 and 20% were obtained for the
last energy level regarding 0.22 and 0.30 m layers, respectively, which exceed
Brandl (1977) requirements for base layers.

Results from CA31.5 trial layers did not allowed to establish correlations be-
tween SPLT as reference test and performance related tests. Therefore, equip-
ments calibration for each kind of material is required. In what concerns to the
influence of state parameters on mechanical performance, it seems that mois-
ture content has great influence, yet further conclusions requires investigation
of trial layers with constant moisture constant, covering a range from 2% dry
of optimum to optimum.

Comparison between full scale trial and laboratory results 163

6.7 Comparison between full scale trial and lab-

oratory results

Comparison between moduli obtained from full scale trial and laboratory
tests are performed herein. To this end, stress and strain levels on both field
and laboratory tests are taken into account, as well as, state conditions.

Firstly, comparison between modulus obtained from SASW carried out on
0.40 m wOPM and modulus computed from S–wave measurements on specimen
with similar moisture conditions is performed. Methodology for the determina-
tion of moduli is based on S–wave propagation through geomaterial, thus in-
volving similar stress and strain levels. Laboratory results obtained on specimen
with optimum moisture content (8.8%) were considered since state conditions
are the closest to the ones verified on trial layer 0.40 m wOPM. The SASW was
carried out on grids B6 and B9 where Vs = 195 m.s

?1 and Vs = 169 m.s
?1 were

obtained, respectively. However, moisture conditions obtained from NM carried
out on closest grids, B7 and B10, were 7.6% and 8.8%, respectively. Thereby,
only the latter is used herein for the sake of comparison. The state conditions
and shear modulus determined from field and laboratory tests are summarized
in Table 6.9. It is noteworthy that laboratory shear modulus was computed
using Equation 5.9 and parameters given in Table 5.9. A total mean stress of
2 kPa corresponding to mean stress at the middle of the layer was considered.
In addtion, to take into account the great influence of unsaturated condition at
this stress level, matric suction computed from expression given in Figure 5.2
was added and a mean stress of 21.8 kPa was obtained. It should be noted that
matric suction value is just an approximation since laboratory matric suction
versus saturation degree curve was determined considering a void ratio of 0.331,
whereas field void ratio is 0.370. This notwithstanding, it is thought to be a
good approximation taking into account a high saturation degree (about 70%).
Further, shear modulus was corrected for the same void ratio.

Shear modulus computed from S–wave measurements with bender elements
and accelerometers are given in Table 6.9. A perfect match is observed between
field shear modulus and shear modulus computed from S–wave measurements
with accelerometers. On the other hand, shear modulus computed from S–wave
measurements with bender elements is about 13% higher. Nevertheless, a good



164 Field investigation: ETRE

relationship between field and laboratory results is found.
Secondly, comparison between modulus obtained from SPLT and triaxial

tests is conducted. As aforementioned, stress and state conditions should be
taken into account, thereby field parameters were gathered from NM and SPLT
results and are summarized in Table 6.10. As described on Chapter 2, EV2 mod-
ulus following AFNOR standard is computed for a stress level about 200 kPa.
Consequently, laboratory secant modulus is estimated for the same stress level
and considering the strain level involved in SPLT performed at each layer. Tri-
axial tests did no enabled secant modulus for strain levels lower than 0.5%,
however modulus degradation curves lie between a reference threshold given by
Santos (1999), as illustrated in Figure 5.10 in previous chapter. Hence, secant
modulus was computed from Equation 5.8, which parameters are given in Ta-
ble 5.5, for ?1 = 200 kPa and then estimated from the relationship obtained
from G/G0 degradation curves (Ishibashi and Zhang, 1993; Santos, 1999) for
the strain levels involved in SPLT (?SPLT in Table 6.10) and 1% (see fig. 5.9).
Finally, secant modulus was normalised for field void ratio.

Concerning to layers compacted with moisture content 2% dry of optimum
(0.30 m wOPM?2% and 0.50 m wOPM?2%), average EV2 modulus differs less than
8% from modulus determined from triaxial tests on specimen with identical
moisture content. However, comparison between average EV2 modulus from
layers 0.40 m wOPM?2% and 0.40 m wOPM+2% and secant modulus determined
from specimen with similar moisture content (wOPM) show a difference lower
than 18%. Regarding 0.40 m wOPM layer, moisture content is about 1% dry of
optimum and specimen with similar moisture content is not available. As so
comparison with specimen with optimum moisture content is carried out and a
difference of about 7% is found.



Conclusions 165

These results denotes a reasonable relationship between field and laboratory
modulus and assumes great importance taking into account two issues: i) design
is based on mechanical properties usually determined from laboratory tests; ii)
even though conventional triaxial tests only allow determination of mechanical
properties beyond strain level of 1%, for SC geomatrial is possible to estimate
secant modulus from degradation curves for lower strain levels since degradation
curves lie between reference threshold for sands given by Santos (1999).

Finally, the same procedure was adopted in order to establish comparison
between ESASW and modulus obtained from conventional triaxial tests. With
this purpose, laboratory modulus was computed using Equation 5.8. A total
vertical stress of 4 kPa at the middle of the layer was considered and matric suc-
tion was added, likewise described previously. Laboratory modulus of 3.6 MPa
was obtained, corresponding to a strain level of 1%. From modulus degradation
curves obtained in previous chapter (fig. 5.10), modulus reduction at this strain
level is about 85%. Thereby, modulus was corrected to take into account the
strain level and the same void ratio. As so, laboratory modulus of 22 MPa was
achieved, which compares with ESASW equal to 132 MPa. The hudge difference
found may be due to the estimation of laboratory modulus for a low stress level,
which was computed out of the stress interval regarding Equation 5.8.

The relations between laboratory and field modulus found are illustrated in
Figure 6.37.

6.8 Conclusions

In this chapter the main results obtained on full scale trial were presented.
Two type of geomaterials, clayey sand (SC) and a crushed aggregate (CA31.5),
were investigated. To this end, construction of trial layers with different thick-
nesses (0.22, 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m) and different moisture contents (2% dry of
optimum, optimum and 2% wet of optimum Modified Proctor) were carried out,
as well as evaluation of state conditions and mechanical properties for several
energy levels.

State conditions were evaluated by means of sand cone method (SCM) and
nuclear method (NM), the latter requiring calibration. Regarding SC trial lay-



166 Field investigation: ETRE

ers, moisture content about 3% dry of optimum was achieved on trial layers
0.30 m wOPM?2% and 0.50 m wOPM?2%, average moisture content 1.5%wet of
optimum was achieved on trial layers 0.40 m wOPM?2% and 0.40 m wOPM+2%,
and average moisture content 0.5% dry of optimum was achieved on trial layers
0.40 m wOPM. The adverse weather conditions during construction of trial lay-
ers with 0.40 m thickness might had contributed to moisture content mismatch,
since favorable weather conditions were verified during construction of trial lay-
ers with 0.30 and 0.50 m thickness. Further, statistical data showed higher
moisture content coefficient of variation (CV) from SC trial layers compacted
dry of optimum, rather than SC trial layers compacted with moisture content
wet of optimum. As so, the previous stack of material, water adding and mix
up by means of a front shovel did not reproduced the desirable homogeneity
on moisture content of trial layers compacted dry of optimum. This notwith-
standing, dry density CV lie below maximum values given by Brandl (1977),
with exception to layer with 0.50 m thickness. Average relative compaction of
about 95–96% was obtained from trial layers with 0.40 m thikness, whereas 98
and 94% was obtained from trial layers with 0.30 and 0.50 m thickness, respec-
tively. As so, layer thickness strongly influences relative compaction. To this
end, layer with 0.50 m thickness does not fulfill quality control requirements of
high quality projects, namely those regarding high speed embankments.

Concerning to CA31.5 trial layers, moisture content 1% wet of optimum
was achieved on layer with 0.22 m thickness, whereas moisture content close to
optimum value was achieved on trial layer with 0.30 m thickness. As so, desirable
moisture content was achieved only for the latter. Further, it is noteworthy that
moisture content strongly varied within increasing energy level. In fact, moisture
content obtained from both layers for the first enelgy level was about 1.5% dry
of optimum. Once again, the previous stack of material, water adding and mix
up by means of a front shovel did not reproduced the desirable homogeneity
on moisture content. However, adverse weather conditions during construction
of CA31.5 trial layers might had contributed to a strong variation of moisture
conditions. Nevertheless, for the last energy level both trial layers presented
identical moisture content CV (5 and 7%), whereas dry density CV were less
than 2%. Moreover, the same relative compaction was found, about 106%.

Mechanical evaluation was performed by means of static plate loading test
(SPLT) and performance related tests, namely, impact tests (falling weight de-
flectometer – FWD and light falling weight deflectometer – LFWD), the soil
stiffness gauge (SSG) and spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW), and con-
tinuous compaction control test method by means of Portanceme?tre.

With regards to SPLT, tests were conducted accordingly standards AFNOR
NF P94–117–1 (2000) and DIN 18134 (2001). Further, SPLT following AFNOR
was carried out using two settlement measuring systems: one measuring settle-
ment on a point at the center of the plate through a hole; another measuring
settlement three concentric points on the periphery of the plate. Results from
the former measuring systems were found to be more than 30% higher than cor-
responding values obtained with the latter. Furthermore, analysis of AFNOR
and DIN standards showed differences concerning to test proceed and test inter-
pretation. As so, it was demostrated that values obtained from tests following
each standard can only be compared if interpreted for the same stress (200 kPa)
and using the same method (secant method). In addition, equivalent modu-
lus should take into account different plates diameter if a multi–layered system



Conclusions 167

is being tested. Conclusions regarding SPLT led to the specification project
(Gomes Correia et al., 2007) that is presented in Appendix B.

Further, correlations between performance related tests and SPLT moduli
were established, where SPLT following AFNOR was used as reference test.
Good correlation between SPLT and Portanceme?tre moduli was established for
SC trial layers, the latter being about 10% higher than the former. These results
indicate the huge potential of this equipment for the continuous stiffness evalu-
ation on earthwork platforms, being a non destructive method easy to operate
enabling quick evaluation of moduli and large number of tests, which allows
statistical analysis. Moreover, the instantly layout of moduli enables immediate
intervention ever quality control requirements are not achieved. In addition,
afterwards treatment of results allows spacial characterization of full area of
compacted layer. Thereby, mechanical evaluation by means of Portanceme?tre
represents a great improvement on quality control/quality assurance (Qa/Qc)
of compacted layers. Although a correlation close to unity was obtained be-
tween SPLT and LFWD on SC trial layers, high scatter led to poor correlation.
Thereby, results from this equipment should be treated with caution. No corre-
lation was found between SPLT and the others performance related tests. Re-
sults from CA31.5 trial layers did not allowed to establish correlations between
SPLT as reference test and performance related tests. Therefore, equipments
calibration for each kind of material is required.

Then, evaluation of state conditions and mechanical properties with increas-
ing energy level was conducted. In what concerns to SC trial layers no clear
relationship between dry density and moduli was found. In contrast, moduli was
found to decrease with increasing moisture content, as observed from laboratory
results from previous chapter, thus reflecting suction effect on mechanical prop-
erties. Further, Portanceme?tre moduli CV decreased with increasing moisture
content. These results denote the great influence of moisture content either on
average moduli and on homogeneity of mechanical performance of layers em-
bankment. With regards to CA31.5 trial layers, moduli was found to follow
moisture content variation concerning energy levels corresponding to 4 to 10
passes. Moduli increased with increasing moisture content, as long as moisture
content varies between 2% dry of optimum and optimum value. This trend
indicates the great influence of moisture content on mechanical performance
rather than dry density. As so, higher requirements regarding compaction con-
trol should be considered when compaction is performed with moisture content
on the dry side, rather than compaction on the wet side, as long as compacted
layers will remain in unsaturated condition. To this end, continuous evalua-
tion of mechanical performance represents a great improvement on compaction
control.

Finally, comparison between full scale trial and laboratory results was per-
formed. Shear modulus obtained from SASW carried out on trial layer 0.40 m
with optimum moisture content was found to be similar to shear modulus given
by laboratory tests. Moreover, a maximum difference of 19% between modulus
obtained from SPLT following AFNOR standard and modulus estimated from
triaxial compression tests was found, which assumes great importance taking
into account two issues: (i) design is based on mechanical properties usually
determined from laboratory tests; (ii) even though conventional triaxial tests
only allow determination of mechanical properties beyond strain level of 1%, for
SC geomatrial is possible to estimate secant modulus from degradation curves

for lower strain levels since degradation curves lie between reference threshold
for sands given by Santos (1999).

Field investigation: Fafe
trial road embankment
(FTRE)

7.1 Introduction

In the aim of a national research project POCI/ECM/56952/2004 with the
goal to validate/calibrate in situ the results obtained in laboratory for the pro-
cessed steel slag (inert steel aggregate for construction, ISAC), a trial road
embankment was constructed where, besides this non–traditional geomaterial,
traditional geomaterials, a poor–graded sand with silt and a well–graded gravel
named herein as SP and CA40, respectively, were employed (Gomes Correia
et al., 2009b; Reis Ferreira, 2010). The execution of a trial embankment em-
ploying different materials gave the opportunity to carry out different studies,
which are twofold: (i) mechanical performance of geomaterials were evaluated by
means of static plate loading test (SPLT) and performance related tests, falling
weight deflectometer (FWD) and light falling weight deflectometer (LFWD),
the soil stiffness gauge (SSG), spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW) and
Portanceme?tre; (ii) instrumentation of the embankment and road layers en-
abling the measurement of vibrations and strains induced by the compaction
equipment and by performance related tests.

Likewise to E?vora trial railway embankment (ETRE), the first issue aims to
establish correlations between different test methods using SPLT as reference
test. Taking into account conclusions from previous chapter regarding SPLT
and the outcome of the specification project presented in Appendix B, SPLT
were performed following this specification project. To this end, SP, CA40 and
ISAC trial, embankment and base layers were compacted employing different
thicknesses (0.20, 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m) and optimum moisture content regard-
ing Modified Proctor. Index parameters and mechanical properties were then
evaluated for several energy levels corresponding to 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 passes of
the vibrating roller. A detailed description is given in Chapter 4. As so, firstly
index parameters are evaluated by means of sand cone method (SCM), rubber
balloon method (RBM) and nuclear method (NM). Secondly, SPLT is used

169



170 Field investigation: FTRE

as reference test and correlation with performance related tests is established.
Then analysis of full scale trial results is conducted and recommendations are
provided. At last, comparison between field and laboratory results is performed.

The second issue deals with vibration measurements of roller drum and layers
vibrations during compaction and application of dynamic loads. It is intended
to get data in order to investigate the interaction between roller drum and layer
to be compacted, as well as to realize the magnitude of strains and acceler-
ations induced during compaction, application of dynamic loads with several
equipments, such as, FWD, LFWD, the Portanceme?tre and during applica-
tion of static loads while performing SPLT. In this scope, firstly, in–ground
strains and acceleration measurements during application of dynamic loads are
presented and, secondly, roller drum behaviour and layers in–gound behaviour
during compaction process is presented.

7.2 State conditions

In this section SCM and NM results, namely dry density and moisture con-
tent will be presented. The interpretation of both tests is straight. Likewise in
previous chapter, since NM involves measurements at the same spot at depths
of 0, 0.06 and 0.12 m, an average value at each spot was computed. Then, a re-
lationship between density (?w) and volumetric water content (?) between both
tests results was attempted for SP and ISAC materials and is shown in Figures
7.1 and 7.2.

Firstly, in Figure 7.1 only values obtained from tests carried out on the same
grid are included and grid homogeneity is assumed. A reasonable relationship
between density and volumetric water content was obtained for SP material
(R2=0.53 and R2=0.55), while a poor relationship was achieved for ISAC ma-
terial. Secondly, a relationship between average values per energy level for each
layer was attempted in order to reduce scatter (fig. 7.2). Poor relationships
were obtained regarding ISAC geomaterial. Therefore, NM appears not to be
appropriate to evaluate moisture content of ISAC geomaterial and, thereby, cal-

Figure 7.3: SCM parameters plotted against NM calibrated parameters: (a)

Following, the state parameters obtained from each test method on SP com-
pacted layers are presented in Figure 7.4 for several energy levels. Due to time
constraints and labor intensive SCM number of tests are significantly less than
NM tests. Dry density exceeded the maximum value given by Modified Proctor
for all layers and energy levels, which may be attributed to a high energy level
employed by compaction equipment. In fact, the distribution of points indicate
that maximum dry density is achieved at a lower moisture content on the dry
side of modified compaction curve which features a higher energy level applied.
Trial layers (0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m wOPM) were compacted with moisture content
about 3% to 2% dry of optimum, whereas moisture content ranging between 2%

dry of optimum and optimum value was achieved on embankment layers (4th,
5th, 6th, 7th and 8th layers).

Since an extensive mechanical characterization was performed for the last
energy level, focus is given to layers state conditions at this stage. In Table 7.1
is given respective statistical data regarding SP trial layers and embankment
layers. In what concerns to the former layers, moisture content achieved ranged

from 6 to 4% dry of optimum. The highest dry density was obtained from trial
layer with 0.40 m thickness, whereas the lowest was achieved on trial layer with
0.50 m thickness even though a higher energy level was applied. These results
denote the influence of layer thickness on dry density regarding compaction
equipment used. Concerning to embankment layers, all constructed with 0.40 m
thickness, average moisture content ranged from 2% dry of optimum to opti-
mum. It is noteworthy that to the lowest dry density achieved in 5th layer
corresponds to the higher moisture content.

The wetting process employed on SP material involved the previous stack of
material, water adding and mix up by means of a front shovel and, in addition,
moisture content was corrected in situ before compaction process. Still, this
procedure did not always met the desirable moisture content.

7.3 Modulus from SPLT

In Table 7.2, only average results will be presented since the limited number
of tests carried out do not allow to compute other statistical parameters. SPLT
were carried out following specification project developed by Gomes Correia
et al. (2007). It is noteworthy that modulus obtained from tests performed on
ISAC trial and base layer were about 63% and 56% than the corresponding
values obtained from SP trial layer and base layer, respectively.

7.4 Moduli obtained from performance related

tests

7.4.1 LFWD, FWD, SSG and Portanceme?tre

Similarly to Chapter 6, statistical data (average and standard deviation,
SD, and coefficient of variation, CV) was computed from moduli obtained from
LFWD, SSG and Portanceme?tre and data is given in Appendix D for each trial
layer and for energy levels evaluated. The number of tests enabling statistic
treatment by layer and energy level were listed in Chapter 4.

The FWD modulus EFWD was computed and statistical data is also pre-
sented in Appendix D. All tests were conducted starting with one seating load
followed by one load drop at three different drop heights, generating this way
three different loads, in each station. A load plate with 0.45 m in diameter was
used and a flexible load plate was considered.

7.4.2 SASW

With the aim to perform a SASW test, SP capping layer was instrumented
with accelerometers on the surface. Six vertical receivers (accelerometers) were
placed on the ground and offset in incremental distances from a fixed center-
line. Because the compacted layers of about 0.40 m are under consideration and
taking into account filtering criterion described in Chapter 2, the receivers were
offset of 0.40 m, as is illustrated in Figure 7.5. All tests were performed on SP
capping layer inside grid L6.

Figure 7.5: Setup adopted to perform SASW on SP capping layer inside grid
L6

Several tests were performed applying different impulsive loads in line with
the receivers at a distance away from the receiver equal to receivers spacing. Ac-
tive Rayleigh wave data were generated using a light hammer, a sledge hammer,
LFWD and FWD sources. To improve the signal–to–noise ratio, the impacts
are repeated several times. A reverse test is also performed with the source in
the opposite side of the receiver array, when a light or sledge hammer source is
used, in order to confirm the first test. Satisfactory results were obtained with
light hammer, LFWD and FWD sources.

The acquisition system was described in previous chapter.



Moduli obtained from performance related tests 175

Results from test using a light hammer

As illustrated in Figure 7.6, a light hammer source generate high–frequency
Rayleigh waves in the range of 10–1500Hz. This range is higher than the one
obtained from SASW tests in ETRE (recall section 6.4.2).

Estimation of the dispersion curve was computed using three pairs of sig-
nals, namely, 0.40-0.80m, 0.80–1.60m and 1.20–2.40m, which information was
assembled considering filtering criterion, as described in Chapter 2. Experimen-
tal dispersion curves corresponding to the first test and the reverse one (fig.
7.7) were then obtained, where only fundamental mode was considered. Figure
7.7 shows that no significant differences are seen between experimental curves
obtained with first and reverse test. Therefore only results from first test were
analysed. Since the number of points in the composite dispersion curve is not
manageable for the successive inversion process, a polynomial regression was
adopted.

previously in Chapter 2. Table 7.3 gives these values for all stages, as well as

the square root of the final value of the objective function (f

to 1900 kg/m3 was assumed at this stage. The lowest value of f
1/2

for the shear wave profile corresponding to an earth model with one layer over
halfspace. From Table 7.3 it can be seen that a layer with thickness of 0.41 m
is identified on the top, which corresponds to the capping layer.

agreement between theoretical and experimental composite dispersion curves,
as illustrated in Figure 7.8. From the shear wave profile Young modulus re-

respectively.

Results from test using a sledge hammer

The typical waveforms of signals generated using a sledge hammer source
and respective spectrum is shown in Figure 7.9. This source type generates
frequency Rayleigh waves almost in the range of 5–1500Hz.

Reverse test did not allowed to compute dispersion curve due to the bad
coherence between signals from pairs of sensors. With regards to first test,
signals from pair formed by sensors positioned at 0.40–0.80m did not enabled
to compute dispersion curve, for the same reason. This was probably due to

curve was computed using only two pairs of signals, corresponding to sensors at
0.80–1.60m and 1.20–2.40m, and is illustrated in Figure 7.10. One can see that
data is scarce, which was probably due to generated short range of frequency
waves, and dispersion curves from both pairs of sensors did not matched; thus
data was considered to be poor and did not allowed to proceed analysis.

Keeping constant drop height, at least 6 drops were performed in order to
compute dispersion curve shown in Figure 7.12. Likewise to the sledge hammer
test, the same pairs of signals were used and same filtering criterion applied.
Pair 0.40–0.80m did not allowed to compute dispersion curve due to the bad
coherence between signals. Similarly to conclusions for sledge hammer test,
frequency waves over 190 Hz practically were not generated, though did not
provided wave lengths lower than the distance between sensors (0.40 m). This
notwithstanding, good correlation between the other pairs of signal was obtained
enabling calculation of dispersion curve.

the square root of the objective function demonstrates good agreement between

theoretical and experimental dispersion curves (fig. 7.16). Moreover, f

fairly lower than the one obtained previously on stage 3 regarding an earth model

7.5 Correlation between E modulus for several

tests

Likewise in previous chapter, in what follows, correlation between E modulus
obtained from different tests (SPLT, LFWD, SSG, Portanceme?tre, FWD and
SASW) will be established. To this end, EV2 modulus from SPLT will be set
as the reference value.

It should be noted that, before the establishment of correlations, being Por-
tanceme?tre a continuous test, the data given by this equipment was treated in
such a way to be possible to compare values with spot tests. In this sense,
an average value of EPort modulus per grid was computed, in the same way
as in the previous chapter. The methodology employed to the establishment
of relationships between SPLT and performance related tests was based is the
following steps:

(i) comparison between tests results performed in the same spot for all energy
levels;

(ii) comparison between tests results performed in the same grid for all energy
levels;

(iii) comparison between average values per energy level;

(iv) perform previous iterations, yet only considering the last energy level.

Due to the small dimensions of the trial, embankment and base layers, it
seems to not make sense to group these values into homogeneous, as done for
ETRE. Once again, ever tests results are unavailable or established relationships
at each step show high scatter will not be presented. The results analysis was
divided by type of material studied and is presented in the following sub sections.

7.5.1 SP trial and embankment layers

In Figure 7.17 is shown the relationship between SPLT modulus (EV2) and
Portanceme?tre and LFWD moduli (EPort and ELFWD), despite only two SPLT
available. Comparison between tests results on the same spot show a EV2 1.5
times greater than ELFWD. On the other hand, a correlation close to unity
observed between EPort and ESPLT moduli, which means moduli given by both
test methods are similar. Thus, further relationships were attempted using
Portanceme?tre as reference test, however, high scatter did not allowed the es-
tablishment of correlations.

Finally, moduli obtained from SASW is analysed. Interpretation of tests
performed on capping layer inside grid L6 resulted in moduli ranging from 135
to 165 MPa. Inside the same grid, LFWD, SSG and Portanceme?tre were carried
out and moduli equal to 57, 112 and 83 MPa were obtained respectively. When
these results are compared with SASW, significant differences are achieved.
SASW modulus is approximately 160, 35 and 80% higher than LFWD, SSG
and Portanceme?tre moduli. These differences are probably related with two
fundamental aspects, namely, stress and deformation level applied by each test
method. LFWD and Portanceme?tre applies higher stress and deformation levels
than SSG, thus attempting on non linear behaviour of SP material it results in

7.5.2 ISAC trial and embankment layers

Likewise to SP material, correlations between moduli were carried out. Firstly,
in Figure 7.18 EV2 modulus is plotted against EPort, ELFWD and ESSG moduli.
ESPLT modulus is higher, approximately 44%, than the corresponding values
obtained with Portanceme?tre (EPort), despite lack of results to allow sustain-
able conclusions. For this reason, it seems that calibration of Portanceme?tre
was not suitable for this type of material. Concerning moduli obtained from
LFWD and SSG tests, these are fairly lower than the ones obtained from SPLT.
As one can see, EV2 is about two times ELFWD and more than two times ESSG.

Owing to the lack of SPLT results and likewise to SP material, Portanceme?tre
was used as reference test. In Figure 7.19, moduli given by Portanceme?tre,
LFWD and SSG are compared. In Figure 7.19a correlation between EPort and
ELFWD moduli is established for average values per layer and energy level, where



184 Field investigation: FTRE

poor correlation is verified (R2 = 0.41). Nevertheless, EPort appears to be about
18% higher than ELFWD. Also poor correlation (R

2 = 0.38) was found for com-
parison between EPort and ESSG, regarding moduli obtained on the same grid
and for the last energy level. EPort is about 47% higher than ESSG.

7.5.3 CA40 base layer

Concerning SPLT, only one test was carried out on this type of material,
which ESPLT result was 119 MPa. Nevertheless, comparison with the corre-
sponding values ELFWD, EFWD and ESSG obtained from tests performed inside
the same grid is conducted in Table 7.9. In addition, also average values are
given. It should be noting that FWD modulus was gathered from second drop
weight with corresponding stress below the plate of 193 kPa, which is closer to
the 200 kPa applyied on SPLT.

One can see that average ELFWD and ESSG are almost the same as EV2,
though moduli obtained in the same grid differed 21% and 6%, respectively. On
the other hand, EFWD either obtained from FWD carried out on the same grid
or average value was about 24% lower than EV2.



Analysis of full scale trial results and recommendations 185

7.6 Analysis of full scale trial results and rec-

ommendations

The evolution of mechanical properties of trial layers with increasing energy
level and with state conditions will be evaluated herein. Taking into account
poor correlations found previously, only Portanceme?tre results will be used.

In Figures 7.20, 7.21 and 7.22 are plotted moduli obtained from Portanceme?-
tre, and state parameters, obtained from SCM and NM (after calibration),
against the number of passes. The maximum relative compaction is achieved
for 6 passes for trial layers with 0.30 and 0.50 m, yet, concerning to the latter,
maximum moduli is only achieved for 12 passes. With regards to trial layer with
0.40 m thickness, both maximum relative compaction and moduli are achieved
for 12 passes of the vibrating roller.

rameters (relative compaction and moisture content deviation) evolution with
number of passes: (a) Moduli and relative compaction; (b) Moduli and moisture
content deviation

Focusing on the analysis of moduli and relative compaction regarding all trial
layers, it seems that dry density has great influence on mechanical properties.
Moduli seems to follow dry density trends, i.e, increases with increasing dry
density and vice–versa. This trend is similar to the one verified for ETRE on
SC trial layers (recall section 6.6).

Further, the influence of state parameters on mechanical performance is in-
vestigated. To this end, in Figure 7.23 is plotted moduli and relative compaction
against moisture content deviation for the last energy level for trial and embank-
ment layers.

One can see a wide range of state parameters. Moisture content devia-
tion ranged from 6% dry of optimum to optimum, whereas relative compaction
varied between 102% and 113%. However, modulus appears to not vary signifi-
cantly with moisture content. For example, relative compaction corresponding
to moisture content deviation about 4%, 2% and 0.5% dry of optimum is quite
similar, yet modulus is identical for the limits moisture contents and lower cor-
responding to 2.5% dry of optimum. Thereby, moisture content appears have
unnoticeable influence on mechanical properties for the moisture content range

investigated. In contrast, relative compaction appears to influence mechanical
properties. Grouping results by similar moisture content deviation, namely,
about 4%, 2% and 1%, one can observe that modulus increase with increas-
ing relative compaction, i.e, dry density. An investigation of hydro–mechanical
behaviour of SP material is required in order to justify these conclusions.

Further, regarding quality control state parameters and moduli scatter earn
to be commented for last energy level. Concerning to SP trial layers the highest
dry density CV was obtained from NM carried out on layer with 0.40 m thick-
ness, about 5%, whereas trial layers with 0.30 and 0.50 m thickness presented
CV lower than 2%. Owing to embankment layers, a dry density CV lower than
3% was achieved. As so, state parameters CV lie below the maximum values
given by Brandl (1977), 5% for dry density determined by means of NM. Owing
to moisture content, a CV varying between 6% and 25% was verified, where the

Figure 7.23: EPort modulus and relative compaction (RC) versus moisture con-
tent (w) obtained on SP trial and embankment layers for the last energy level

highest value was obtained in 0.40 m trial layer and the lowest obtained in 7th

embankment layer.

The analysis of mechanical properties scatter was based on Portanceme?tre
results (see Table D.15). Trial layers presented identical modulus CV ranging
from 6 to 8%, while embankment layers presented modulus CV ranging from
4 to 9%. As so, moduli CV mainly lie below the required maximum given
by Brandl (1977), which is 25%. No relation between state parameters and
modulus scatter was found.

The analysis of results from full scale trial allowed to conclude that the
wetting process employed on SP did not produced desirable moisture content.
Process involved the previous stack of material, water adding and mix up by
means of a front shovel and, in addition, moisture content was corrected in situ
before compaction process. Still, this procedure did not always met the desirable
moisture content. Further, NM appear not to be appropriate for determination
of state parameters of ISAC material.

Concerning to mechanical evaluation, the reduced number of SPLT did not
allowed the establishment of reliable correlations with performance related tests.
Nevertheless, a correlation close to unity was observed between SPLT and Por-
tanceme?tre for tests carried out on SP, whereas on ISAC SPLT modulus was
found to be approximately 1.45 times modulus obtained from Portanceme?tre.
These results shows that an adequate calibration using SPLT is required. There-
fore, it is recommended to conduct calibration during execution of trial embank-
ments. This notwithstanding, the quick execution and the immediate layout of
the results allowed quick intervention whenever the deformability conditions
were not achieved, which highlights the great advantage of this equipment, be-
sides being a continuous method.

Poor correlations with other performance related tests, namely LFWD and
SSG, using Portanceme?tre as reference test were obtained due to high scatter.
Therefore, the results from these equipments should be treated with caution.

7.7 Comparison between full scale trial and lab-

oratory results

Likewise to previous chapter, comparison between moduli obtained from full
scale trial and laboratory tests are performed herein. To this end, stress and
strain levels on both field and laboratory tests are taken into account, as well
as, state conditions.

Firstly, comparison between modulus obtained from SASW carried out on
capping layer and modulus obtained from triaxial tests carried out in the aim of
a doctoral thesis (Reis Ferreira, 2010). The variation of secant modulus versus
total vertical stress considering a strain level of 4 × 10?5 is given by Equation
7.1.

Esec = 211 ·

(

?1
pa

)0.64

(7.1)

To take into account in situ stress and strain levels laboratory modulus was
determined for a total vertical stress of 4.5 kPa, corresponding to an average
vertical stress at the middle of the capping layer with 0.40 m thickness. Since
suction data is not available regarding SP material, a matric suction level similar
to the one determined from SC material was adopted, about 20 kPa, in order
to take into account unsaturated condition. As so, a laboratory modulus of
86 MPa was obtained and then corrected for the same in situ void ratio. With
regards to strain level, no correction was conducted since there are no available
laboratory results regarding in situ strain level involved in SASW test (1×10?6).
Nevertheless, accordingly Ishibashi and Zhang (1993) degradation curves there
is no significant modulus reduction these strain levels. The state conditions and
modulus determined from field and laboratory tests are summarized in Table
7.10.

The only laboratory results available were obtained on specimen with opti-
mum moisture content (12%), whereas in situ moisture content is about 2% dry
of optimum. From Table 6.9 one can see that field modulus is about 5% to 50%
higher than laboratory modulus. However, these results should be treated with
caution due to simplifications adopted.



Field monitoring of roller drum and capping layer vibrations 189

Comparison between SPLT and laboratory results was conducted by Reis Fer-
reira (2010) using the same procedure described previously. However, a stress
level of 200 kPa and a strain level of 1 × 10?3 were considered. Laboratory
modulus was found to be about 10% to 27% greater than modulus obtained
from SPLT on SP layers and ranged from 3% to 26% higher than modulus ob-
tained from SPLT on ISAC layers. In the same manner, also modulus obtained
from SSG was compared with laboratory results. Once again, laboratory results
were found to be about 13% higher than SSG modulus. In Figure 7.24 moduli
obtained from laboratory tests are plotted against moduli obtained from field
tests.

7.8 Field monitoring of roller drum and capping

layer vibrations during compaction and ap-
plication of dynamic loads

As described in Chapter 4, field monitoring of vibrations (vertical strains and
vertical accelerations) was conducted in two phases. Phase One measurements
were carried out on capping layer in materials ISAC and SP during dynamic
tests, namely, LFWD, FWD, Portanceme?tre and during roller drum vibration.
Phase Two involved measurements of roller drum vibrations, as well as capping
layer vibrations during compaction of base layer.

7.8.1 Phase One: Instrumentation

The instrumentation in this phase involved strain gauges and accelerometers.
It is important noting that while the former reflects both static and dynamic
response, the latter only reflects dynamic response.

The setup adopted is illustrated in Figure 4.16a, in Chapter 4. One strain
gauge was buried in the capping layer of SP profile at depth 0.43 m, while an-
other strain gauge was buried in the capping layer of ISAC profile at depth
0.45 m. Though the sensors depth were slightly different for the two profiles,
they are close enough to elicit comparison. It should be noted that these sensors



190 Field investigation: FTRE

were not calibrated previously to its in–ground placement, thus values presented
hereafter are direct values given by sensors. In addition, two uniaxial accelerom-
eters were buried in the top and bottom of the capping layer. For SP profile
profile, the top and bottom accelerometers were placed at depth z = 0.10 m
and z = 0.45 m, whereas for ISAC profile sensors were placed z = 0.22 m and
z = 0.47 m. As so, bottom accelerometers also allows comparison, despite dif-
ferences in depth, while top accelerometers do not allow direct comparison. The
characteristics of these accelerometers are given in Table 7.11.

7.8.2 Phase One: Test results

LFWD

For both profiles, ISAC and SP, two LFWD tests were performed at surface
capping layer, one at strain gauges vertical alignment and another at accelerom-
eters vertical alignment, thereby enabling the evaluation of vertical in–ground
strains and in–ground accelerations. Each LFWD test consisted in at least six
impacts and a plate with 300 mm diameter was used.

The force versus displacement loops corresponding to one impact at each
vertical alignment on both profiles are plotted in Figure 7.25. An average
Fpeak = 15 kN loading was measured for LFWD performed in the SP pro-
file, while an average Fpeak = 15.5 kN loading was measured for tests performed
in ISAC profile, corresponding to average stress below the plate of 212 and
219 kPa, respectively. It is interesting noting that significant differences be-
tween plate displacements are observed, mainly those corresponding to LFWD
tests performed in ISAC material, though spot tests were spaced of 0.50 m.

Figure 7.26 illustrates the strain measurement during LFWD testing on both
profiles. In Table 7.12 is summarized data obtained from LFWD carried out at
strain gauges vertical alignment and respective in–ground peak strains measure-
ments. Identical peak strains were measured in SP and ISAC profile (356×10?6

and 361×10?6, respectively) reflecting similar modulus obtained from tests in-
terpretation. Moreover, strain response stress ratio is approximately 1.67 for
both profiles. Despite different materials being tested, identical stress strain
behaviour is found from profiles at strain gauges vertical alignments.

The acceleration time histories are presented in Figures 7.27a and 7.27b and
peak acceleration data is given in Table 7.13. The acceleration data from top
accelerometer in SP profile is not provided because exceeded the measurement
range of the sensor, which means acceleration peak was higher than 49.1 m/s2.
This was probably due to the lower depth of top accelerometer in SP profile
(z = 0.10 m) than in ISAC profile (z = 0.22 m). One can see that peak from top
accelerometer lags peak from bottom accelerometer due to wave propagation
through profile. Further, in order to estimate displacements double integration
on frequency domain was conducted on accelerometers data (see figs. 7.27c
and 7.27d) and computed peak displacements are given in Table 7.13. Negative
values represent downward displacement.

One can see that both acceleration and displacement peaks decrease with in-
creasing depth. It is noteworthy at higher depth (0.43 and 0.45 m) the amplitude
of upward acceleration exceeded the downward acceleration in SP profile and
was the same in ISAC profile , whereas at z = 0.22 m in ISAC profile down-
ward acceleration exceeded the upward acceleration. Acceleration data from

Figure 7.27: Accelerations time histories from in–ground accelerometers due to

SP profile presented the greater difference between acSPp+ and ac
SP
p?. Concerning

displacements on ISAC profile, a reduction about 78% between peak negative
displacements from top and bottom sensors is verified.

Comparison between in–ground peak displacements from both profiles shows
that computed displacements at higher depth in SP profile is almost two times
the corresponding observed on ISAC profile, indicating thereby greater stiff-
ness from ISAC profile. In fact, a higher ELFWD was obtained on ISAC profile
which is consistent with estimated displacements. However, computed displace-
ments differ by a factor of about 2.1, yet moduli only differ about 1.6, despite
applied stress almost the same. Aiming to understand these differences, the-
oretical modulus, stress and strain were computed from static loading theory
applied to a homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic half–space. Accordingly to
Achenbach (1999) cited by Mooney and Miller (2009) elastic theory consider-
ing static loading can be used for dynamic loading when the time for stress
waves through the volume of soil involved is much less than the duration of the
load pulse. For LFWD testing on ISAC and SP materials, shear wave veloc-
ities of about 90 m.s?1 and 170 m.s?1, respectively, were estimated from time

lag between LFWD sensors located at 300 and 600 mm far from the center of
the plate. Assuming a effective depth of 1.5D, travel times of 5.0 and 2.6 ms
are about three to five times less than the load pulse duration (approximately
13.5 ms). Therefore, static analysis using measured dynamic force provides a
reasonable approximation to which the dynamic stress measurements can be
compared. Through equations 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4, theoretical stress and strain
response beneath the center of a circular plate can be determined (Timoshenko
and Goodier, 1951), where ?z, ?r and ?? are vertical, radial and tangential
stresses, ?z is vertical strain, z is depth, E is Young modulus and ? is Poisson
ratio which is assumed to be 0.35 and R is the radius.

From static loading theory (equations 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4), relations between
moduli and strains, thus, displacements, should be similar. Therefore, on one
hand, ELFWD obtained from SP profile may be underestimated or, on the other
hand, ELFWD obtained from ISAC profile may be overestimated.

To this end, observed differences can be explained by different contact stress
distributions between the plate and ISAC or SP materials. Moduli calculus
was carried out considering uniform contact stress distribution corresponding
to flexible plate. However, elastic half–space theory predicts inverse parabolic
distribution if a rigid plate is considered, although a parabolic stress distri-
bution may be considered depending on material type being tested (Terzaghi,
1943). The author suggested inverse parabolic distribution on cohesive soil and
parabolic distribution on granular soil. Indeed, ISAC material is a granular
material where suction does not play significant role, thereby parabolic stress
distribution seems to be more suitable. As so, modulus and in–ground strains
were computed considering uniform and parabolic stress distribution given by
equations 7.5 and 7.6, respectively (Mooney and Miller, 2009). Results are
summarized in Table 7.14.

A ELFWD = 112 MPa is obtained on ISAC material, corresponding to ap-
proximately 2.1 times ELFWD obtained from SP, which is similar to the obtained
displacement relation. Further, relation between theoretical strains considering
parabolic contact stress for ISAC and uniform contact stress for SP is approxi-
mately 2.2. Therefore, it seems that parabolic contact stress distribution is more
suitable to LFWD tests performed in ISAC material when compared to LFWD
results obtained from SP material considering uniform stress distribution below
the plate.

Vibration induced strain levels were also evaluated and are given in Table
7.14. Assuming elastic plane wave propagation (reasonable for vertical wave
propagation along test vertical alignment), peak axial strain levels were esti-
mated from the relationship between estimated velocity and compressional wave
velocity ( u?

Vp
) derived from the specific and characteristic impedance in combi-

nation with Hooke’s law. Estimated velocity (u?) is computed by integration of
acceleration signal, whereas compressional wave velocity (Vp) is estimated from
equations 7.7 and 7.8. A ? = 0.35 is used throughout. Axial strain levels were
in the range of 10?6 at sensors depth. Vibration induced strain levels reflects
dynamic portion of strain response and represents approximately 25–27% of
total strain resulting from static response plus dynamic portion.

To sum up, strains measurements from both profiles (356 and 361×10?6) and
corresponding moduli (60 and 62 MPa) appears to be consistent since relations
between measures are similar. In contrast, though computed displacements from
acceleration data (145 and 69µm) and corresponding moduli (54 and 84 MPa)
appears to be consistent, respective relations between measures, 2.1 and 1.6,
indicate that modulus obtained on ISAC may be underestimated. Considering
parabolic stress distribution below the plate, relation between moduli is found to
be 2.2. Therefore, it seems that parabolic stress distribution is more appropriate
for ISAC material when presenting high stiffness.

FWD

The procedure adopted for FWD tests was the same described earlier for
LFWD. FWD tests were performed at surface capping layer at the vertical
alignment of strain sensors and accelerometers in both profiles. Tests were car-
ried out using a circular loading plate with a diameter of 450 mm and consisted
in impact loads from three drop heights. Only one impact by each drop height
was performed. It should be noted that FWD test in SP profile was performed
after LFWD test, while FWD in ISAC profile test was carried out after roller
drum stationary vibration.

Figure 7.28 shows the force versus displacement data gathered by the equip-
ment. Three force levels of approximately 20, 30 and 47 kN are generated. Good
agreement between plate displacements from both tests performed on SP is ver-
ified. In contrast, plate displacements measured during tests on ISAC material
differs significantly. In fact, plate displacements obtained from FWD carried
out at strain vertical alignment are almost twice the corresponding value ob-
tained from FWD carried out at accelerometer vertical alignment. This result
was unexpected since tests were spaced of 0.50 m. This may be attributed to ad-
ditional compaction during drum tests, since they were performed before FWD
tests. Plate displacements obtained from FWD on ISAC profile are about a
half and a third of plate displacements measured on SP material, which denotes
lower deformability from ISAC material. Further, it is noteworthy that ISAC
material presents almost no viscosity.

Figure 7.29 illustrates the strain time histories during FWD testing on ISAC
and SP profiles. In Table 7.15 is summarized data obtained from these tests.
In both profiles strains increased with increasing stress applied by FWD de-
vice corresponding to higher drop heights. Unexpectedly strains obtained from
ISAC profile are greater than obtained from SP profile, since ISAC profile was
supposed to have greater stiffness. In fact, FWD moduli obtained in ISAC pro-
file were almost two times the ones obtained in SP profile. Theoretical strains
were computed from static loading theory in order to understand these results.
Load pulse duration was about 33 ms, whereas the calculated travel times are
4.0 to 7.5 ms, corresponding to four to seven times less, thereby, static loading
theory can be applied. Loading stresses were similar in both tests, thus, through
the equations 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4, lower strains levels are expected for profile with

file presented higher modulus, higher strains were measured. This behaviour is
not consistent with theory and reasonable explanation was not found.

The strain response stress ratio (?z=0.43/0.45/?) due to all loadings was com-
puted in order to eliminate response stress dependence. Values 3.16, 3.50 and
3.70 were found from SP profile, whereas 6.41, 5.92 and 5.85 were obtained from
ISAC profile. As one can see, values for SP material seems to indicate that
strain response at z = 0.43 m is dependent on stress applied, where an increase
on stress applied results in strain softening response. This finding demonstrates
non linear behaviour of SP material at the evaluated depth range for in situ state
conditions and stress levels applied. Regarding ISAC material, though strain
response seems to be non linear too, a hardening response is observed. These
softening and hardening response of SP and ISAC material, respectively, may
be explained from the stress dependency of soil stiffness. It is well documented

that soil stiffness increases with increasing confining stress and decreases with
increasing shear stress. Within each impact due to falling weight, the shear
stress and confining stress increases. From the previous results it seems that
the decrease of stiffness due to increasing shear stress overlaps the increasing
confining stress effect for SP material, resulting in a softening response with
increasing stress. On the contrary, for ISAC material, the confining stress effect
seems to superimpose to the increase of shear stress, leading to a hardening
effect.

Owing to FWD tests carried out at accelerometers vertical alignment, ac-
celeration time histories and computed displacements are illustrated in Figure
7.30. Also here acceleration and displacement data are not provided ever accel-
eration exceeded the measurement range of the sensor. In Table 7.16 is given
acceleration and displacement peak data.

One can see that acceleration and displacement peaks increase with increas-
ing applied stress and decrease with increasing depth. Acceleration peaks ob-
tained from in–ground accelerometers in SP profile were higher than the ones
obtained from in–ground accelerometers in ISAC. In SP profile, acSPp? exceeded

acSPp+ at both depths and the difference between peaks increased with increasing

drop height. Conversely, in ISAC profile acISACp+ exceeded ac
ISAC
p? at both sen-

sors, with exception to result from accelerometer at z = 0.45 m corresponding
to the 3rd drop height. Nevertheless, difference between peaks decreased with
increasing drop height. Likewise to acceleration data from LFWD tests, one
can see that peak from top accelerometer lags peak from bottom accelerometer
due to wave propagation through profile.

A reduction of about 53% between top and bottom (0.22 m and 0.47 m) peak
displacements is obtained in ISAC profile for all stress levels. With regards to
SP profile, results available denotes a reduction of 66% between displacements
obtained at z = 0.10 m and z = 0.45 m. Comparison between displacements
from both profiles denote a different trend from strain results. Displacements on
SP at z = 0.45 m ranged between 1.9 to 2.6 times the correspondent observed
on ISAC at z = 0.47 m, despite stress applied by equipment does not differ
significantly. These results indicate higher stiffness from ISAC profile, which is
testified by higher moduli, about three times greater than corresponding moduli
from SP profile.

Taking into account conclusions regarding stress distribution below LFWD
plate in previous section, the relations between displacements and moduli due
to FWD tests were investigated too. In Tables 7.17 and 7.18 are given the

results from this iteration. If a parabolic stress distribution is considered relation
between moduli increases to 3.9, 4.0 and 4.3, which is greater than the ones found
for uniform stress distribution. As so, different relations are found regarding
displacements and moduli gathered from both profiles.

In Tables 7.17 and 7.18 is also given vibration induced strain levels. Once
again, axial strain levels were in the range of 10?6 at sensors depth. The dynamic
portion was estimated and values of approximately 25–29% of total strain were
found. Note that this values are similar to the ones found from LFWD results.

Portanceme?tre

Strains and acceleration recorded during the pass of Portanceme?tre are pre-
sented in Figures 7.31 and 7.32. As described in Chapter 2, Portanceme?tre
operates at typical speed of 1.0 m/s and excitation frequency of 35 Hz. Data
was referenced to each in–ground sensor. The abscissa reflects the position of
the Portanceme?tre, which is traveling left to right, thus, negative x indicate
that Portanceme?tre is approaching the sensors while positive x indicate that
Portanceme?tre is moving away from the sensors. The x = 0 position means
that Portanceme?tre is in the vertical alignment of the sensor. While accelera-
tion measurements reflects only cyclic forces generated by the vibrating wheel,

strain measurements reflect both the static weight of the equipment and the
cyclic forces. The effects of overburden and previous tests have been removed
so the strain measurements presented here are due to the Portanceme?tre alone,
i.e., strains at the beginning are equal to zero.

Figure 7.31 illustrate total strains measurements during Portanceme?tre pass
on SP and ISAC profiles and respective cyclic portion. Peak strains are sum-
marized in Table 7.19. Both total and cyclic strains in ISAC profile were about
twice than those obtained in SP profile. This behaviour was unexpected since
Portanceme?tre performed in each profile showed greater deformability of SP
profile. The ratio between cyclic and total strains were similar, about 30%.

It is worth noting that in ISAC profile, material immediately in front of
the vibrating wheel experiences vertical extension, whereas in SP material this
behaviour is unnoticeable. This phenomenon was also observed by Mooney and
Rinehart (2009) in a gravelly sand test bed (30% gravel, 10% fines) and almost
unnoticeable in a more fine–grained material. The authors refer to it as a bow

wave phenomenon which is due to the traveling nature of the vibrating load-
ing. Further, Figure 7.31 reveals no plastic strain resulting from Portanceme?tre
test on ISAC profile, whereas on SP profile small plastic strain was observed.
At strain sensors depth the width of the zone of material influenced by the
equipment is about 0.80–0.90m at ISAC profile and 0.90–1.0m at SP profile.

Concerning to dynamic response given by acceleration time histories, accel-
eration peak decreases with depth, as illustrated in Figures 7.32a and 7.32b.
Moreover, acp+ exceeded acp? at both sensors located at top of capping layer.
Differences between peaks decreased for bottom accelerometers, being almost
the same. Double integration on frequency domain was conducted on data
gathered from the accelerometers in order to compute the approximated dis-
placements (see figs. 7.32c and 7.32d). Negative values represent downward
displacement. In Table 7.20 is given peak accelerations and displacements.

As observed previously for acceleration data, displacements are higher near
the point of load application and decrease as depth increases. A reduction of 70%
and 75% between top and bottom peak displacements is verified, corresponding
to SP and ISAC profiles, respectively. Further, displacements at z = 0.45 m in

SP profile is about 1.7 times the corresponding displacement obtained on ISAC
profile. This relation appears to reflect moduli obtained on both profiles, EPort
from ISAC profile being about 1.2 times EPort from SP profile. Regarding to
displacements at depth z = 0.10 m, displacements obtained in SP profile are
greater 1.3 times than the ones obtained in ISAC profile at z = 0.22 m. This
trend is contrary to the observed through strain data.

It is interesting noting that displacement computed from bottom accelerome-
ter on SP slightly decreased when Portanceme?tre loading is on vertical alignment
of accelerometers. Displacements increased as Portanceme?tre approached, peaks
at approximately 0.15 m away from sensor, slightly decreased to a local mini-
mum when the roller was just above the sensor, increased as Portanceme?tre was
moving away, peaks again at approximately 0.15 m away from the sensor, and
decreased beyond this point. Beneath loading shear stress and strain are the-
oretically zero or very small compared with normal stresses and strains (John-
son, 1987). Hence, it seems that strains induced by Portanceme?tre at depth
z = 0.45 m when was approaching and moving away from the sensor results
from shear and normal strains acting together.

Roller drum

Vibrations measurements induced by vibratory roller were also carried out
on both SP and ISAC profiles. A Hamm 3412 smooth drum vibratory roller
was used during investigation. The total weight of the compactor is 12200 kg,
with the static weight under the front drum and rear tires equal to 6705 kg
and 5495 kg, respectively. The drum is 1.504 in diameter and 2.140 m in width
and houses an eccentric mass configuration that provides circular excitation at
frequencies of 30 and 40 Hz. Manually set eccentric configurations provide ec-
centric static moments ranging between 256 and 215 kN and nominal amplitudes
between 1.91 and 0.90 mm, respectively. The drum–frame connection configu-
ration is different on the right and left sides and access to a non–rotating mount
was only possible on the left side (see fig. 7.33).

Besides in–ground instrumentation, one accelerometer was embarked on the
roller in order to monitor its behaviour during vibrations measurements at this
stage. This was embarked on the non–rotating mount on the left side where
access was available. Taking into account the asymmetry of the drum, another
accelerometer was placed on the top and at the middle of the drum in order to
investigate the influence of sensor location. This was carried out during drum

Two types of tests were performed on SP test bed. Firstly, measurements
of in–ground vibrations were carried out during the pass of the vibrating roller.
Drum vibration was not monitored during this test. Secondly, the roller was set
in place in order to the drum apply vibratory load above accelerometers and
remained stationary during vibration. The drum was allowed to apply vibratory
loading during at least 4 seconds. The eccentric configuration was set in order
to provide the lower eccentric static moment at the beginning of record. Then,
eccentric static moment was manually increased by the operator until roller
drum become to translate laterally. Therefore, for the sake of comparison of

mentation

tests conducted in each profile, it should be bear in mind that each test did not
had the same eccentric static moment time history.

In Figure 7.34 is shown the in–ground total and cyclic strain response, as well
as, the acceleration and approximated displacements response during vibrating
roller pass. In Table 7.22 peak data is summarized. Likewise to Portanceme?tre
results, the effects of overburden and previous tests have been also removed.
Again, data was referenced to each in–ground sensor and abscissa reflects the
position of the roller drum. From strain response (figs. 7.34a and 7.34b) one can
see that cyclic response represents 98% of total strain response, which indicates
that drum remained in contact with the material during compaction. No plastic
strain was observed after roller pass. At sensor depth (z = 0.43 m) the width of
the zone of material influenced by the roller is about 0.70–0.80m.

Owing to dynamic response given by acceleration histories (fig. 7.34c), ac-
celeration peak decreases with depth. A greater difference between positive and
negative peaks acceleration was observed for sensor near surface, where negative
peak is greater than positive peak. On the contrary, positive peak acceleration
given by bottom sensor is greater than negative peak. This fact denotes high non
linear behaviour (Mooney et al., 2005). Note that results show lower difference
between negative and positive peaks, which tends to linear behaviour response.
Approximated displacements were computed through double integration on fre-
quency domain and are illustrated in Figure 7.34d. As observed previously for
acceleration data, displacements are higher near the point of load application

and decrease as depth increases. A reduction of 60% between top and bottom
displacement is verified.

Figure 7.34: Vibration response from in–ground sensors on SP test bed during
vibrating roller pass: (a) total strain response; (b) cyclic strain response; (c)
acceleration response; (d) approximated displacements

The time and frequency content of acceleration responses on SP test bed
due to drum stationary vibratory loading are presented in Figure 7.35, as well
as approximated displacements, which were determined from acceleration data
through double integration in the frequency domain. From the time history
acceleration data, peak values were gleaned for upward and downward in vertical
direction and are presented in Figure 7.35a. Following a positive down sign
convention, peak positive acceleration is downward and occurs when the drum
is in the highest point in its trajectory. Conversely, peak negative acceleration
is upward and occurs when the drum is at its lowest point.

Focusing on frequency content, one can see that excitation frequency is about
19 Hz. The analysis of the drum acceleration time history presented in Figures
7.35c and 7.35d corroborates the results in frequency domain. Indeed, 19 Hz is
about half of the operation frequency of the roller, which ranges between 30 and
40 Hz. As so, drum operating in periodic loss of contact, specifically, operat-
ing in double jump (Adam, 1996), was set as hypothesis. However, it is worth
noting that frequency content covers low to high eccentric static moments. Al-
though double jump operating mode is rather probable for high eccentric static

moments, for low eccentric static moments, probability is lower. Nevertheless,
continuous compaction control still may be applied in double jump operating
mode (Adam, 1996). Taking into account the strain results during roller pass,
it is believed that roller drum was in contact with the ground during vibration.



Field monitoring of roller drum and capping layer vibrations 207

Another explanation might be an improperly operation of the excitation system.
These hypothesis could not be confirmed since the roller was no longer available
at the time of this analysis.

Owing to the acceleration time history on SP profile illustrated in Figure
7.35a, acceleration peak decreases with depth. Differences between peak positive
(acdp+ ) and negative accelerations (acdp?) of the accelerometer embarked on
the roller drum yields non linear behaviour of the coupled drum–soil system.
Note that acdp? exceeds acdp+ for lower eccentric static moments, while the
opposite is observed for greater eccentric static moments . The nonlinearity of
the coupled roller drum–soil system media distorts the output of a sinusoidal
input forcing function. The distortion is manifested in harmonic content within
drum vibration response spectra (Ewins, 2000; Mooney et al., 2005), as can be
observed from frequency content in Figure 7.35b.

Another behavioural characteristic from acceleration time history is worth
noting. Beyond the 3 seconds, the acdp? remains almost constant, despite in-
creasing eccentric static moment. On the contrary, acdp+ fairly increased. Thus,
surface deformation seems to remain almost constant, despite increasing vibra-
tion force. This is confirmed by the approximated displacements determined in
frequency domain which remain almost constant beyond 3 seconds, as can be
seem in Figure 7.35e.

Regarding in–ground accelerometers, differences between acdp+ and acdp?
of the top accelerometer (z = 0.10 m) are noticeable for higher eccentric static
moment and remained almost constant beyond 2.5 seconds. No significant dif-
ferences were seen for lower eccentric static moments (fig. 7.35c). On the other
hand, acdp? (32 m.s

?2) exceeds acdp+ (24 m.s
?2) in 33% for higher eccentric

static moments (fig. 7.35d). This seems to indicate non linear behaviour at
z = 0.10 m for lower vibrations forces, while increasing vibration forces yields
increasing non linear behaviour. Concerning to acceleration at z = 0.45 m, dif-
ferences between acdp+ and acdp? are unnoticeable during increasing of eccentric
static moment, which seems to reflect linear behaviour. Along with the other
sensors, peak accelerations from accelerometer at z = 0.45 m remain constant
for higher eccentric static moment.

These findings indicate non linear behaviour below the drum for the applied
eccentric static moments during vibration on SP test bed. Further, non linear
behaviour at depth z = 0.10 m for higher vibration forces is observed, while at
depth z = 0.45 m linear behaviour seems to be present for the applied eccen-
tric static moments. In addition, for greater eccentric static moments, drum
peak negative acceleration and in–ground peak acceleration remained almost
constant, i.e., deformation remained almost constant (see fig. 7.35e). This indi-
cates non linear relationship between vibration force applied by the drum and
deformation below the drum and in depth.

For ISAC profile only stationary vibration test was performed. Time and
frequency content of acceleration responses due to drum vibratory loading are
presented in Figure 7.36, as well as approximated displacements computed from
acceleration data. The frequency content of the drum acceleration presented in
Figure 7.36b given by either accelerometer on the left side of the drum or the
accelerometer placed on the top at the middle shows a peak amplitude about
19 Hz indicating that drum was operating at this frequency. The acceleration
time history illustrated in Figure 7.36e confirms this finding.

Concerning to the drum acceleration measurement, Figure 7.36a presents

peak accelerations given by accelerometers placed on the left side of the drum
and at the top at the middle of the drum. One can see that acceleration from
both sensors slightly differs. Acceleration given by accelerometer located at the
left side is greater than acceleration given by the sensor located at the top at the
middle of the drum for lower eccentric static moments and tends to be almost
the same for higher eccentric static moments. Since the acceleration level during



Field monitoring of roller drum and capping layer vibrations 209

tests carried out on ISAC afterwards were close to the values reached for higher
eccentric static moments in this measurement, the location of the accelerome-
ter has almost no influence on acceleration results. However, from computed
displacements illustrated in Figure 7.36e, one can see that displacement deter-
mined from accelerometer located on the left side of the drum is about 85%
of the displacement exhibited on the top and at the middle of the drum. It is
worth noting that signal from accelerometers placed on the left side of the drum
on the non–rotation mount showed higher noise levels, as can be confirmed from
drum acceleration time and frequency content in Figures 7.36b and 7.36d.

In contrast to the observed in measurements carried out in SP test bed for
lower eccentric static moments, differences between acdp+ and acdp? given by
sensors embarked on the roller drum were unnoticeable till acceleration level
about ±20 m.s?2, yielding, therefore, linear behaviour of the coupled drum–soil
system. In Figure 7.36a can be seen that beyond this point, as acceleration level
increases acdp+ becomes greater than acdp? indicating non linear behaviour.

Acceleration measurements in depth at ISAC test bed showed a different
trend from the results seen previously in SP test bed. Although for lower ec-
centric static moments acceleration peak decreases with depth, as expected,
for greater eccentric static moments acdp+ follow the same trend, while acdp?
slightly increased with depth, as illustrated in Figure 7.36a . Regarding sensor
located at z = 0.22 m, differences between acdp+ and acdp? were significant.
On the other hand, despite no significant differences between peak accelera-
tions given by accelerometer at z = 0.45 m were seen for the lowest eccentric
static moments, acdp? become greater with increasing eccentric static moment.
This notwithstanding, the approximated computed displacements followed the
normal trend, since a decreased with increasing depth is observed in Figure
7.36e. In fact, for the greatest eccentric static moment applied, approximated
displacement at depths z = 0.22 m and z = 0.45 m were approximately 0.40 and
0.28 mm, corresponding to 47% and 33% of the surface displacement determined
from accelerometer on left side of the drum (0.85 mm), as shown in Figure 7.36f,
and a reduction of 30% between in–ground displacements.

From results obtained at ISAC test bed, differences between peak accelera-
tions obtained with accelerometers located on the drum and at depth z = 0.22 m
indicate non linear behaviour when applied eccentric static moments similar to
the compaction process. On the contrary, results obtained from accelerometer
located at z = 0.45 m indicate linear behaviour.

7.8.3 Phase One: Comparison between tests results

In Tables 7.23 and 7.24 are summarized data gathered during performance
of different mechanical tests by material type, SP and ISAC, attempting to
establish relation between in–ground measurements. Due to different loading
nature, comparison will be conducted accordingly loading type, namely, impact
loads (LFWD and FWD) and vibrating loads (Portanceme?tre and roller drum).
Nevertheless, strain measurements from both profiles allow to conclude that
tests are ordered by increasing induced strains, which seems to indicate that
roller drum has the higher depth influence, whereas LFWD has the lowest.

Moreover, in–ground displacements obtained from acceleration measurements
were consistent with profiles stiffness. Higher in–ground displacements were
found regarding SP profile than in ISAC profile, which is consistent with lower

modulus obtained in the former than the latter. Hence, in–ground dynamic
response reflect moduli obtained from dynamic tests performed at layer surface.

Comparison between LFWD and FWD results

Prior to results analysis it should be noted that tests on SP profile were
carried out ordered in the following way: LFWD, FWD, Portanceme?tre and
roller drum. In contrast, tests on ISAC profile were carried out by the following
order: LFWD, Portanceme?tre, roller drum and FWD.

Focusing on SP profile, it is noteworthy that moduli obtained from LFWD
on strain and accelerometers vertical alignments spaced of 0.50 m are similar, as
moduli obtained from FWD are similar too. To this end mechanical properties
of this profile may be considered homogeneous. This conclusion is corroborated
by relations between in–ground measurements given in Table 7.25. Displacement
response stress ratio (u?/?) and strain response stress ratio (?/?) were computed
in order to eliminate response stress dependence.

One can see that both u?/? and ?/? obtained at z = 0.43 m from FWD test
is about twice (2.19 and 2.08) the corresponding value obtained from LFWD
test. These relations are close to that predicted from homogeneous, isotropic,

linear elastic theory considering a single modulus, which led to a
?/?FWD
?/?LFWD

of

1.80. Nevertheless, relations between in–ground strains and displacements are
similar showing, thereby, measurements consistency with both type of sensors.
Further, one can see that both in–ground strains and displacements at bot-
tom of the layer are higher due to FWD test, even though lower stress levels
are applied concerning first and second drop heights. These results denote the
greater depth influence from plate with high diameter. Indeed, taking into
account homogeneous profile and considering a single modulus, theoretical ap-
proach (equations 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4) corroborate these results. To this end, even
though moduli obtained from LFWD and FWD carried out on SP profile dif-
fers, in–ground measurements with both strain gauges and accelerometers show
consistency with theoretical approach considering a single modulus. As so, this
results highlight the importance of tests methods calibration to a reference test.

With regards to ISAC profile the same analysis was attempted. However,
significant LFWD and FWD moduli is verified for both vertical alignments.
This is probably due to roller drum stationary vibration which was carried out
between LFWD and FWD tests and may have induced significant differences
on profile mechanical behaviour. Moreover, even though tests were conducted
on spots spaced 0.50 m, moduli noticeably differs and, thereby, homogeneity can
not be assumed. To this end, theoretical approach was conducted using moduli
obtained from each test.

At ISAC section u?/? obtained at z = 0.22 m from both tests were similar,
only differing about 12%, yet higher values were obtained for LFWD test. The
relation given by theoretical approach reveals a difference of about 40%. This
notwithstanding, these results shows consistency. At bottom of the capping

layer (z = 0.45 and 0.47 m) a
u?/?FWD
u?/?LFWD

close to 2 was found. However, theoretical

values revealed a relation close to 0.80. Moreover, at the same depth ?/?FWD
was over three times greater than ?/?LFWD, while theoretical approach shows a
relation of 0.80. These results are not consistent with static linear elastic theory.



212 Field investigation: FTRE

As so, results from ISAC profile showed inconsistency with theoretical approach,
which might be due to significant mechanical properties changes induced by
stationary vibrating.

Comparison between Portanceme?tre and roller drum results

Strain measurements and computed displacements during roller drum and
Portanceme?tre passes are directly compared only for SP profile, since measure-
ments during roller drum pass on ISAC profile are not available.

Regarding strain response at bottom of SP capping layer, total peak strain
induced by Portanceme?tre is about 58% of corresponding value induced by roller
drum, whereas cyclic strain induced from the former represents 36% of the latter.
These results demonstrates either greater depth of influence and greater stress
applyied by the roller drum. Further, it is interesting to note that at strain
sensors depth the width of the zone of material influenced by Portanceme?tre is
about 0.90–1.0m, whereas the width of the zone of material influenced by the
roller drum is on the order of 0.70–0.80m.

Concerning to approximated vertical displacements higher differences are
verified. At the top of capping layer (z = 0.10 m) peak negative displacements
induced by Portanceme?tre were found to be 25% of displacements induced by
roller drum, while at bottom of capping layer (z = 0.45 m) Portanceme?tre in-
duced displacements are only 12% of the ones induced by roller drum. A similar
dynamic in–ground response is found at higher depth. Since roller drum and
Portanceme?tre wheel dynamic behaviour reflects dynamic in–ground response,
this fact might indicate a good correlation between mechanical properties de-
termined from instrumented rollers and Portanceme?tre. It is noteworthy that
this relation is one third of the one found from strain results.

Though peak accelerations are not presented in Tables 7.23 and 7.24, com-
parison between measurements during vibration pass of both equipments are
compared too. From top accelerometer (z = 0.10 m) peak negative and positive
acceleration levels corresponding to Portanceme?tre pass were 13 and 20 m.s?2,
respectively, whereas values corresponding to roller drum pass were 49 and
32 m.s?2. From bottom accelerometer (z = 0.45 m) peak negative and positive
acceleration levels corresponding to Portanceme?tre pass were 4 and 5 m.s?2,
respectively, whereas values corresponding to roller drum pass were 18 and
21 m.s?2. It is noteworthy that positive peak value is greater than negative
peak value during Portanceme?tre pass, while the opposite is verified during
roller drum pass. In contrast, at z = 0.45 m positive peak values are greater
than negative peak values during both equipment passes. These features indi-
cate different type of responses to vibrating load at z = 0.10 m and z = 0.45 m,
which is probably due to stress–strain levels induced by each equipment. At
greater depth differences between peak values decrease which might be associ-
ated to a stress–strain behaviour close to linear. The greater differences observed
at lower depth are related to nonlinear stress–strain behaviour. Indeed, from
strains measurement, roller drum seems to induce higher stresses.

7.8.4 Phase Two: Instrumentation

The setup adopted in this phase is illustrated in Figure 4.16b of Chapter 4.
Either in–ground strain gauges and accelerometers placed at bottom of the



Field monitoring of roller drum and capping layer vibrations 213

capping layer (at depth 0.45 m in Phase One) were left in same position, while
the accelerometers in the top of the capping layer were replaced by new strain
gauges. As so, the same setup was implemented for both ISAC and CA40+SP
profiles, where two strain gauges were placed at 0.32 m from the surface of
the base layer and another strain gauge and one accelerometer were located at
0.65 m depth. In addition, another strain gauge was buried in the capping layer
belonging to profile ISAC+SP at 0.32 m depth from the surface of base layer.
This operation was carried out after material placement and before roller passes.

Besides in–ground instrumentation, one accelerometer was embarked on the
roller on the non rotating mount on the left side, in order to monitor its be-
haviour during compaction. However, high noise level was detected on the
acceleration signal during pass 1. The author became aware of this problem
and it was found to be due to a wire problem. Therefore, data from roller drum
during this pass was discarded. In order to prevent malfunction of one sensor,
two accelerometers (Ac drum 1 and Ac drum 2) were embarked on the drum
during further passes (2 to 10). Frequency domain features were determined
from the vibration histories of both accelerometers. Frequency content of the
raw acceleration data of the drum collected from one of the passage of the roller
is shown in Figure 7.37. From these figures some issues earn to be comment.

One can see from frequency content that accelerometer Ac drum 2 only shows
peak magnitude for frequencies of interest, specifically the drum frequency and
its harmonics. On the other hand, frequency content of accelerometer Ac drum
1 shows high magnitude for low frequencies, between 0 and 10 Hz. Due to the
high noise level on raw data from accelerometer Ac drum 1, hereafter drum
acceleration is referred as data gathered from accelerometer Ac drum 2. In
addition, it can be seen that the drum excitation frequency is approximately
19 Hz, similarly to the verified in previous tests with the roller. This issue was
reported in the previous section.

7.8.5 Phase Two: Test results

Drum vertical acceleration measurements

Drum vibration data as recorded continuously during compaction process
on all three profiles in order to do not interfere with construction methodology.
Data was gathered during 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 passes of vibrating roller. However,
due to wire problems with accelerometer embarked on drum during pass 1 of the
vibrating roller, as reported previously, only data from vibrating roller passes 2
to 10 will be presented.

Taking into account that roller had no positioning system and roller velocity
was not recorded, in–ground sensors were used as reference to positioning the
roller drum. In this way, roller velocity was estimated from time lag between the
drum and wheels of the roller passing over strain gauges at each profile. Then,
data was referenced to the middle of each set of in–ground sensors. Thus, data
to be presented corresponds to the traveled distance by the roller over each set
of in–ground sensors, i.e., over each different profile.

Time and frequency domain features were determined from the vibration
histories. The abscissa in following time history figures reflects the position of
the drum relative to in–ground sensors location. The roller is traveling left to
right, thus, negative x indicate that the drum is approaching the sensors. The
drum is directly above the middle of the set of sensors at x = 0 and positive x
indicate that drum is moving away from the sensors.

Computed velocities show that instrumented vibratory roller was driven over
base layer at varying speeds 0.18 to 0.30 m.s?1. Peak vertical drum acceleration
amplitudes measured at the three profiles (ISAC, ISAC+SP and CA40+SP)
during each pass ranged from 15 to 30 m.s?2 and are shown in Figure 7.38.
Note that these acceleration levels are in the range of the ones given by Mooney
et al. (2005) and Mooney and Rinehart (2007). As mentioned previously, dou-
ble integration on frequency domain was conducted on data gathered from the
accelerometers in order to compute the approximated displacements. In Fig-
ure 7.39 computed peak vertical displacements from accelerometer embarked on
the drum are illustrated for the three profiles. Statistical data (average, stan-
dard deviation and coefficient of variation) regarding peak accelerations and
displacements is given in Tables D.17 and D.18 in Appendix D.

Both drum acceleration and displacement decreases with increasing number
of passes, as shown in Figure 7.40. Since, peak negative acceleration occurs
when the drum is at the bottom in its trajectory, i.e., during rebound from the
ground, hereafter peak negative vertical drum acceleration (acd?p ) will be used
as reference. Time domain analysis showed that as base layer was transformed
from its placed state (near Pass 2) to a compacted state (Pass 10), average

In addition, different drum behaviour is found in Figures 7.38 and 7.39 ac-
cording to the type of material being compacted, which means drum vertical
movement is found to be sensitive to changes in underlying materials stiffness.
Comparison between vibration characteristics on different profiles showed the
lowest average acd?p on ISAC profile, while the greatest drum accelerations were
observed on CA40+SP profile. Concerning to vibration results for the last pass
of vibrating roller (10 Pass), average acd?p on ISAC profile was 15 m.s

?2 and in-
creased 22 and 46% for ISAC+SP and CA40+SP profiles, respectively.Vertical
drum displacements during compaction of ISAC profile is about ±1 mm, while
increases approximately 30 and 50%, up to ±1.3 and ±1.5 mm, during com-
paction of profiles ISAC+SP and CA40+SP, respectively.

The decrease of both peak drum accelerations and displacements verified ei-
ther towards increasing number of passes and with different underlying materials
can be related with stiffness. It is known that materials stiffens with number
of passes of the roller. In fact, moduli obtained from SPLT carried out for 10
passes were the highest on ISAC profile. Moreover, moduli obtained from SPLT
performed in ISAC section (ESPLT = 185 MPa) is approximately 50% greater

passes for three type of sections: (a) ISAC; (b) ISAC+SP; (c) CA40+SP

than the correspondent value obtained on CA40+SP profile (ESPLT = 119 MPa).
This relation (50%) is quite similar to the one verified between average acd?p
and zd?p , about 46% and 50%, respectively. As so, one may conclude that peak
drum accelerations decreased with increasing stiffness.

In the same manner, also moduli obtained from FWD carried out were in-
vestigated. FWD results on ISAC section are higher than the corresponding
values obtained on the other sections. Indeed, average EFWD in ISAC profile
regarding to 1st, 2nd and 3rd drop heights is, respectively, 73, 82 and 100%
greater than the corresponding values obtained from ISAC+SP profile, and 54,
64 and 78% greater than the corresponding values obtained from CA40+SP
profile. However, comparison between average acd?p measured on ISAC+SP
and CA40+SP profiles and FWD moduli did not showed the same trend. Av-
erage acd?p , corresponding to 10 passes, measured in CA40+SP profile was 19%
greater than the average peak acceleration measured in ISAC+SP profile, yet
EFWD obtained from tests performed on CA40+SP profile were 10–13% greater
than the EFWD obtained on ISAC+SP profile, which is not consistent with the
previous findings.

However, FWD moduli obtained from test campaigns carried out on these
profiles after placing betuminous layers revealed consistently identical or greater
stiffness of ISAC+SP profile than in CA40+SP profile (Reis Ferreira, 2010). It



218 Field investigation: FTRE

is worth noting that the same type of betuminous material was placed over base
layer. To this end, these profiles only differs on base layer material. Therefore,
it is believed that differences on FWD results are influenced mainly by base
layer and, consequently, reflects the greater stiffness of the ISAC base layer.
These last results are consistent with accelerations measurements.

In order to this phenomena acceleration measurements were investigated.
Though CV for ISAC+SP (14.1%) was much greater than the corresponding
value obtained for CA40+SP (5.7%), it does not seems sufficient to explain
the contradicting trends found. On the other hand, stress dependency of ISAC
material stiffness may explain it. Material stiffness increases with increasing
confining stress and decreases with increasing shear stress. Within an impact
loading, the shear stress increases and the confining stress increases too due
to lateral confinement. Stresses induced by roller drum may be substantially
greater than the stress applied by FWD. To this end, the increase of stiffness
due to an increase of confining stress seems to come over the decrease in stiffness
due to an increase of shear stress. Thus, vibration history of the drum reflects
higher stiffness of ISAC+SP profile. Regarding FWD results obtained from
tests carried out on betuminous layers, it seems that the effect of confining
stress induced by betuminous layers leads to an increasing stiffness of ISAC
material in base layer.

The previous results demonstrated that vibration characteristics exhibited
sensitivity to changes in underlying material properties due to compaction pro-
cess. Drum peak vertical acceleration and displacement decreased as underlying
material stiffens. This type of drum behaviour was observed by Scullion et al.
(2006) and Mooney and Rinehart (2007) when drum is operating at excita-
tion frequencies lower than the natural frequency of drum–soil system. The
frequency content illustrated in Figure 7.38 indicated that roller drum was op-
erating at frequency about 19 Hz. Therefore, the natural frequency of drum–soil
system is believed to be higher.

Focusing on acceleration measurements, the acceleration levels measured at
any time during compaction reflect machine vibration upon a complex body of
involved soil that is stressed by the vibrating drum at a given time and location.
The involved soil ahead of the drum is less dense than the involved soil behind
the drum. Hence, the drum vibration characteristics during any pass reflect
machine vibration on soil that varies from loose state ahead of the roller to
compacted state behind the drum. Either from Figure 7.38 and Table D.17
one can see that peak positive drum acceleration significantly exceeds peak
negative drum acceleration at all profiles and during all passes of the roller.
The overage ranged between 12–28% for ISAC profile, 0–16% for ISAC+SP
profile and 4–7% for CA40+SP profile. Also note that differences tend to be
higher with increasing number of passes, although a clear trend could not be
observed. Difference between positive and negative drum acceleration seems to
be dependent on the changes of underlying materials. Mooney et al. (2005)
found that acceleration amplitudes were close to symmetric in vertical direction
during stationary vibration on a fairly linear elastic underlying medium, whereas
drum acceleration amplitudes on non linear underlying medium were up to
18% greater in the negative vertical acceleration than the positive one. This
difference is also a measure of system nonlinearity due to numerous aspects,
e.g., inelastic soil behaviour, machine nonlinearity, curved drum acting on the
soil surface and possible drum decoupling from the soil (Adam, 1996; Anderegg



Field monitoring of roller drum and capping layer vibrations 219

and Kaufmann, 2004; Mooney et al., 2005; van Susante and Mooney, 2008).

The harmonic content on frequency history also confirmed the non linear
behaviour of soil–drum system. Mooney et al. (2005) investigated harmonic
content as a measure of system nonlinearity. The harmonic components normal-
ized by the fundamental component Hfi/Hf1 and the total harmonic distortion
(THD), both as percentages, were determined for tests carried out with instru-
mented roller over four materials with different stiffnesses, as mentioned earlier.
The THD provided a measure of collective harmonic content and is expressed
as follows:

THD =

?

H2f2 + H
2
f3 + · · · + H

2
fN

Hf1
× 100 (7.9)

The authors verified that the normalized frequency components and the THD
were small (less than 1%) during vibration on rubber tires, which was supposed
to be a fairly linear elastic underlying medium; the majority of the distortion
was manifested in the first harmonic for all test beds. Moreover, normalized
frequency components and THD increased with underlying material stiffness
and was found to exhibit much greater sensivity to changes in underlying ma-
terial stiffness than drum acceleration amplitude. A similar investigation was
conducted with regards to three profiles and results are presented on Table 7.27.

The THD essentially reflects he ratio Hf2/Hf1, since values of Hf3 and Hf4
were much smaller than Hf2. THD varied from 41 to 74% during compaction on
ISAC, 23 to 30% on ISAC+SP and 33 to 46% on CA40+SP profiles. The high
values of THD reflects high non linear behaviour of soil–drum system. Com-
paction over ISAC profile exhibited greater nonlinearity which is consistent with
the ratio between average peak positive and negative drum acceleration given
in Table D.17. However, it seems that there is no linear relation between these
two parameters within the number of passes of the vibrating roller. Regarding
ISAC+SP, THD values are the lowest, while average peak positive and negative
drum acceleration ranges from 0 up to 16%. This interval includes the ratio for
CA40+SP profile (4–7%). This probably due to the greater scatter on acceler-
ation data measured during compaction of ISAC+SP profile that is reflected in
a higher CV.

It is worth noting that magnitude of THD measured during vibration on
ISAC was about 55% greater than magnitude of THD measured during vibration
on CA40+SP, whereas it ranged between 26 to 225% in relation to ISAC+SP
profile. Taking into account previous conclusions, it seems that THD was sen-
sible to changes in underlying material and increased with increased stiffness.
The THD relation between ISAC and CA40+SP profiles of 55% is consistent
with the relation between modulus given by SPLT performed on both profiles.
However, a close look to THD variation within the number of passes in each
profile did not showed a clear trend. When comparison between passes 2 and
10 is established, one can see that THD decreased for ISAC and CA40+SP
profiles, while the opposite was observed for ISAC+SP profile. This trend was
against the established relation between THD and stiffness. Therefore, it seems
that THD is not sufficient feature to be used as indicator of varying stifness.

Field monitoring of roller drum and capping layer vibrations 221

In–ground acceleration measurements

In–ground acceleration measurements were carried out during roller drum
operation over all profiles. Data was gathered during 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 passes
of the vibrating roller on base layer. Similarly to previous analysis, time do-
main features were determined from the vibration histories. Then, data gleaned
from in–ground accelerometers was computed in order to obtain displacements.
It should be highlighted that vibrations measurements reflects only the cyclic
response induced by the roller drum.

Vibration data from accelerometers was referenced to each in–ground sen-
sors, which means that abscissa x reflects the position of the drum relative to
the in–ground sensor location. Negative x indicate that the drum is approaching
the sensors while positive x indicate that drum is moving away from the sensors.
The x = 0 position means that the roller drum was in the vertical alignment of
the sensor. It should be noted that the roller is traveling left to right, except for
pass 1 in which roller traveled in the opposite way. Peak amplitudes time his-
tory of in–ground accelerations measured on ISAC and CA40+SP profiles are
plotted in Figure 7.41 ever results were available. Peak positive and negative
values due to vibration above accelerometers are plotted in Figure 7.42 along
with computed displacements.

A noticeable decrease of in–ground peak accelerations and displacements
between 1 and 10 passes of vibrating roller is observed in both profiles (fig. 7.42).
Peak accelerations (ac+p and ac

?

p ) decreased 21 and 42%, respectively, in ISAC
profile, whereas in CA40+SP profile a corresponding reduction of 32 and 47% is
verified. Regarding peak displacements (z+p and z

?

p ) in ISAC profile, a decrease
of 37% is obtained from both positive and negative displacements, whereas in
CA40+SP profile a reduction of 27 and 32% is verified, respectively. Accordingly
to previous conclusions from drum behaviour, stiffness increases with increasing
number of passes of the vibrating roller. To this end, one may conclude that
both in–ground accelerations and displacements at 0.65 m depth decreases as
base layer stiffens. In fact, both parameters obtained from CA40+SP were
more than twice the corresponding value for ISAC profile (fig. 7.42), which
denotes greater stiffness from ISAC profile. These results are consistent with
the ones obtained on previous sections.

It is noteworthy that a greater decrease of in–ground accelerations and dis-
placements is observed between passes 1 and 2 for both profiles, which denotes
a great improvement in profile mechanical properties between passes 1 and 2.
Concerning ISAC profile, beyond pass 2 an increase of both parameters is ob-
served during pass 4, while from pass 6 to 10 an unclear trend is observed.
Nevertheless, between passes 2 and 10 peak positive in–ground accelerations
and displacements fairly increased, whereas, negative in–ground accelerations
and displacements remained almost the same. Owing to CA40+SP one can
observe that all parameters decreased between pass 2 and 10.

Focusing on acceleration measurements, it is interesting noting that average
ac?p exceeded average ac

+
p in ISAC profile, except to pass 10. The ratio be-

tween these parameters was about 23% for pass 1 and decreased to -10% for
pass 10, which means that acd+p exceeded acd

?

p . From vibration measurements
during roller stationary vibrating loading presented earlier, one can see that for
the same level of drum vibration (ac+p about 20 m.s

?2; ac?p about 15 m.s

tion at z = 0.22 m, while the opposite was observed for in–ground vibration
at z = 0.45 m, where stress level is lower. Given these facts, it seems that
for lower stresses ac?p exceeds ac

+
p , whereas for higher stresses the opposite

is verified. Hence, by applying this finding to the results of in–ground vibra-
tions during ISAC base layer compaction, one may conclude that stress level at
z = 0.65 m increased with increasing number of passes of the vibration roller
and, consequently, with increasing ISAC profile stiffness. This may be explained
by drum–material contact width during successive passes of vibrating roller. As
profile stiffens the contact width narrows and, therefore, applied stress increases
leading to an increase stress in depth.

From in–ground accelerations measured on CA40+SP profile a different
trend was verified. ac+p exceeded ac

?

p for passes 1, 2 and 10 with corresponding
ratios of 15, 38 and 34%, respectively. From vibration measurements during
roller stationary vibrating loading presented earlier, one can see from both ac-
celerometers that ac?p exceeded ac

+
p during low eccentric static moments, i.e.,

lower stresses, while the opposite was observed for high eccentric static mo-

Figure 7.42: In–ground peak acceleration (acp) and peak displacement (zp)
evolution with number of roller drum passes: (a) ISAC; (b) CA40

ments, i.e., higher stresses. Thus, by applying this finding to the results of
in–ground vibrations during CA40 base layer compaction, one may conclude
that stress level at z = 0.65 m increased within passes 1 and 2 and slightly
decreased between passes 2 and 10. Recalling previous section, drum roller re-
sponse indicated that stiffness increased between passes 2 and 10. Given these
opposite trends, it seems that stiffness increase of profile was due mainly to
CA40 base layer.

Another interesting feature is that maximum ac?p occurred when roller was
about 0.50 m away from sensor regarding pass 1. This distance decreased to
approximately half distance to pass 2 and remained constant for the other passes,
which seems to be relate to increasing stiffness of the profile. Note that due to
the roller being traveling in opposite direction during pass 1, the evolution of
in–ground vibration is fairly symmetric to the other lines. In the same way,
negative displacements are highest when drum roller was about 0.30 m away
from the sensor and slightly decreased when the roller drum moved towards
the sensor. A fairly symmetric behaviour was observed when the roller drum
moved away from the sensor (fig. 7.41d). Regarding ISAC profile, although
maximum peak negative displacements were observed when the roller drum was
above sensor during pass 1, for the other passes peak negative displacement was
observed when the roller drum was approximately 0.25 m away from the sensor
and when the roller drum was moving away from the sensor. The phenomena
was also observed from strain data and will be discussed later.

In–ground strain measurements

Strain measurements carried out during 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 passes of the
vibrating roller on base layer are presented in Figures 7.43, 7.44 and 7.45, corre-
sponding to ISAC, ISAC+SP and CA40+SP profiles. It is important to bear in
mind that strain response reflects the response due to both static weight of the
drum and cyclic forces generated by the vibrating drum. Further, it should be
noted that the effects of of overburden and previous passes have been removed
so strains are due to the roller drum only, which means all passes start with
zero strain. Likewise to acceleration data, strain data was referenced to each



224 Field investigation: FTRE

in–ground sensors, which means that abscissa x reflects the position of the drum
relative to the in–ground sensor location.

In Table D.19 is given total strain (?z) and cyclic portion (??z) due to
vibrating roller passes on base layer, as well as the ratio ??z/?z. Note that
for strain gauge V08, placed in ISAC section, only data from passes 2 and 4
are presented, since sensor become inoperative beyond this point. Regarding
strains measurements on CA40+SP profile (strain gauges V01, V02 and V05)
only data from passes 1, 2 and 10 are available. This was due to problems in
the acquisition system during remaining passes.

In–ground peak strains and ratio ??z/?z at roller drum position x = 0 were
evaluated with number of passes and are plotted in Figures 7.46, 7.47 and 7.48.
Data analysis shows that evolution of peak total strain and ratio ??z/?z is
inverse.

A clear trend is observed from strain data obtained in ISAC section, where
peak total strain increases with increasing number of passes, which means with
increasing stiffness of the material being compacted (fig. 7.46a). As mentioned
earlier, this behaviour may be attributed to the narrow contact width of the
drum–material. Though sensors V08 and V09 were at same depth, measured ?z
maximum values ranged from 2500 to 4500 × 10?6 and from 1 to 2200 × 10?6,
respectively. As so, ?z given by strain gauge V08 was about twice the ?z given
by strain gauge V09 (see figs. 7.43a and 7.43b). This may be due to improper
installation of the sensor V08, for example, disturbance of material around the
sensor during placement which was left in a loose state. This notwithstanding,
the same trend is verified from both sensors V08 and V09. With regards to
strain gauge V04 at z = 0.65 m, ?z values ranged from 500 to 1100 × 10

?6,
which were approximately half than the ones obtained from strain gauge V09.
Recall both sensors were placed in the same vertical alignment.

Conversely, ratio ratio ??z/?z was found to decrease within the number of
passes, as illustrated in Figure 7.46b. Actually, ??z for strain gauges V04 and
V09 decreased 43 and 45%, respectively, between passes 1 and 10, yet great
reduction was observed between pass 1 and 2. Since this parameter reflects only
the cyclic portion of strain measurements, comparison with in depth accelera-
tion measurements shows that this trend is consistent with the one found from
accelerometers data at the same depth (fig. 7.42a). Note that the ratio ranged
over 6–18%. The small magnitude of ??z compared to ?z was also found by
Rinehart and Mooney (2009) and result from curved drum–material interaction
and material viscoelasticity. During vibration, the applied force equals the static
force ± a cyclic force depending on eccentric static moment of the roller drum.
Contact stress and contact width are nonlinearly related to force and vertical
drum deflection, and leads to a hardening type relationship between applied
force and drum deflection (see Figure 2.14 in Chapter 2). The deflections (and
in turn strains) due to drum vibration are relatively small compared to deflec-
tions resulting from static loading. Further, one can see from Table D.19 that
??z from V09 and V08 were similar, varying around 120 × 10

?6, which cor-
responds to an order of magnitude less than ?z. ??z from V04 varied around
80 × 10?6, corresponding to less than half the value obtained from sensors V08
and V09.

The strains plot from strain gauge V06 (fig. 7.44) placed at 0.32 m depth in
ISAC+SP section illustrate differences from the previous section. From pass 1
to 2 ?z decreased, increased between passes 2 and 6 and decreased again till last

material stiffness is greatly improved in compacted state, inducing a significant
reduction of stress at SP capping layer, which stiffness is lower, thus explaining
the significant reduction on total strains. On the contrary, the ratio ??z/?z
increased approximately 32% (fig. 7.47b). Note that this trend is contrary to
the one verified in ISAC profile.

With regards to CA40+SP section, a different trend from previous sections
is found. Strain data obtained from sensors placed at z = 0.32 m, V01 and V02,
evolves in different ways, as one can see in Figure 7.48a. As so, the outcome is
inconclusive. In contrast, a clear trend is verified from total strain concerning
to strain gauge V05 placed at depth z = 0.65 m (fig. 7.48a). Total strain
decreased with increasing number of passes. As aforementioned, this finding is
consistent with the stress reducing effect of an overlying stiff layer (Burmister,
1958). Similarly to reported on analysis of data from ISAC section, strains
given by sensors V01 and V02, placed at same depth, are quite different too.
?z measured ranged from 300 to 400 × 10

?6 for the former and from 800 to
1300 × 10?6 for the latter. Regarding strain sensor V05, one can see that ?z
ranged from 500 to 700×10?6, which strains are about half the ones from strain
gauge V09 placed in the same vertical alignment.

Owing to the cyclic portion, once again one can see from Figure 7.48b that
only strain gauge V05 presents a clear trend, where ??z increases with increas-
ing number of passes. However, this trend is contrary to the one observed from
acceleration data (fig. 7.42b). ??z from V01 and V02 is an order of magnitude
less than ?z. ??z from V01 ranged from 40 to 70 × 10

?6 and 130 to 170 × 10?6

from V02. Although sensors were placed at the same depth a significant differ-
ence on ??z from V01 and V02 is noticeable. Concerning to V05, ??z varied
about 40 × 10?6. The ratio ??z/?z ranges over 11–17%, which are consistent
with values obtained for the other profiles.

Focusing on total strain history it is noteworthy that the widening with
depth of the zone of material influenced by the roller, which is on the order of
0.50–0.60m, 0.35–0.45m and 0.40–0.50m at z = 0.32 m corresponding to ISAC,
ISAC+SP and CA40+SP section, respectively, and widens to about 1.40–1.60m
and 1.00–1.10m at z = 0.65 m, concerning to ISAC and CA40+SP sections.

This results shows that a given roller–measured stiffness value is representative
of soil about 0.25–0.30m in the front of and behind the center of the drum
near surface. Through the measurement of depth stress and strain Mooney and

diameter is similar to the area of influence of roller drum, which may explain
the obtained correlation between SPLT results and roller drum behaviour (see
previous section). Therefore, area of influence assumes great importance when
performing correlations of roller–measured stiffness to spot tests results as is
commonly performed in CCC (Mooney and Rinehart, 2009). Further, in order
to investigate depth of influence from both roller drum and SPLT, SPLT was
performed over strain sensors V09 and V04 at ISAC section and over strain
sensors V02 and V05 at CA40+SP section after 10 passes of the roller drum. In
Figure 7.49 are shown the in–ground strains evolution at depths z = 0.32 and
z = 0.65 m with applied stresses below the plate. Bold line refers to in–ground
response during the second load cycle from which modulus is calculated.

Regarding ISAC section (fig. 7.49a), nonlinear behaviour was observed from
strain gauge V09 at depth z = 0.32 m, while at depth z = 0.65 m linear be-
haviour was verified. In second load cycle relative strains of 878×10?6 and
810×10?6 were measured, respectively, which contrast from total strains in-

Figure 7.49: In–ground strains evolution during SPLT carried out on: (a) ISAC
section; (b) CA40+SP section

duced by roller drum during pass 10 (2078×10?6 and 938×10?6). Though
strains at z = 0.32 m induced by roller drum and SPLT differs significantly, at
greater depth (z = 0.65 m) strain levels are quite similar.

In what concerns to SPLT carried out on CA40+SP section (fig. 7.49b), a
hardening response was observed from strain gauge V02 at depth z = 0.32 m,
while at depth z = 0.65 m strain gauge V05 exhibited softening response dur-
ing second loading cycle. This notwithstanding, response may be considered as
fairly linear. In second load cycle relative strains of 1112×10?6 and 568×10?6

were measured, respectively, which seems to match total strains induced by
roller drum during pass 10, 1320×10?6 and 483×10?6. This findings demon-
strated close strain responses between load applied by the roller and SPLT, thus,
are of great importance for the establishment of correlations with roller drum
behaviour. It is noteworthy that strain at the bottom of the capping layer is
two times less than at the top of the same layer. This difference is consistent



230 Field investigation: FTRE

with the stress reducing effect of an overlying stiff layer (Burmister, 1958).

Further, one can see that material immediately in front of the drum experi-
ences vertical extension during pass 1, which is due to the traveling nature of
the roller (Adam, 1996).

Finally, it is interesting noting the development of both ?z and ??z from
sensor V05. These values increased as the roller drum approached, peaks at
approximately at x = 0.05 to 0.15 m, and slightly decreased to a local minimum
when the roller was just above the sensor at x = 0. As the roller moved away,
?z and ??z increased, peaks at approximately at x = 0.05 to 0.15 m and de-
creased beyond this point. Beneath the drum (x = 0) shear stress and strain
are theoretically zero or very small compared with normal stresses and strains
(Johnson, 1987; Hirikawa et al., 2000). Hence, peak strains are due to normal
and shear stresses induced by the roller, which effect is greater approximately
at x = ±0.05 to 0.15 m away from vertical alignment of the sensor. The same
behaviour was found from acceleration data and is identical to the one observed
during Portanceme?tre pass on capping layer of SP profile at depth z = 0.45 m.

7.9 Conclusions

In this chapter, results obtained from several in situ tests performed on
trial, embankment and base layers were presented. Three types of materials
were studied, namely, poor–graded sand with silt (SP) employed in trial and
embankment layers, inert steel aggregate for construction (ISAC) employed in
trial, embankment and base layers and a well–graded gravel (CA40) employed
in base layers.

Firstly, state conditions obtained from sand cone method (SCM), rubber bal-
loon method (RBM) and nuclear method (NM) were presented. NM was found
to be inappropriate to determine state conditions of ISAC layers. Moisture
content of SP trial layers ranged over 3–4% dry of optimum, whereas embank-
ment layers varied between 1 and 3% dry of optimum. The wetting process
employed on SP material which involved the previous stack of material, water
adding and mix up by means of a front shovel and, in addition, moisture content
was corrected in situ before compaction process, did not reproduced desirable
moisture conditions. Moreover, density slightly decreased with increasing mois-
ture content. The highest moisture content coefficient of variation (CV) was
obtained from trial layer with 0.50 m thickness, which denotes the influence of
layer thickness on moisture content homogeneity. Nevertheless, dry density CV
was less than 3% for all layers, which lie below limit given by Brandl (1977).

Secondly, correlations between moduli obtained from light falling weight de-
flectometer (LFWD), soil stiffness gauge (SSG), falling weight deflectometer
(FWD), spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW) and Portanceme?tre using
static plate loading test (SPLT) as reference test were attempted. Concerning
to SP material, though the data is limited, a general relationship between SPLT
(EV2) and Portanceme?tre (EPort) moduli close to unity was found. This means
that results given by these tests are approximately the same validating the cal-
ibration method used and indicate the huge potential of this equipment for the
continuous stiffness evaluation on earthwork platforms. Recall conclusion from
SC material on ETRE was similar. The SPLT results were then compared with
LFWD results, but a difference of approximately 55% was found. Since corre-



Conclusions 231

lation between Portanceme?tre and SPLT is close to unity, the former was used
as reference test to confirm this difference. Comparison between Portanceme?tre
with LFWD was then found to be around 40%. This conclusion differs from
the obtained in previous chapter to SC material. Thus, more results would be
required in order to study the application of LFWD to this type of material.
The relation of Portanceme?tre to the SSG (ESSG) moduli yielded data with large
scatter, although the moduli obtained with both equipments was approximately
the same. Likewise conclusions in previous chapter, the results from LFWD and
SSG equipment should be treated with caution.

With regards to ISAC material different conclusions were obtained regarding
to the ones described in previous paragraph. Moduli given by SPLT (EV2) and
Portanceme?tre (EPort) differ approximately 45%. Correlation between LFWD
and Portanceme?tre moduli was close to unity (only differs 12%), while between
SSG and Portanceme?tre moduli differs 30%. This shows the necessity of equip-
ments calibration for each kind of material. Though it seems possible to estab-
lish correlations between moduli of in situ performance–based tests methods,
material type and state conditions should be taken into account on this eval-
uation. Concerning to CA40+SP profile due to lack of results no sustainable
conclusions were obtained.

SASW were carried out using different sources types, namely light hammer,
sledge hammer and LFWD and FWD equipments. Sledge hammer source was
found not appropriated to the setup employed. On the contrary, good results
were obtained using light hammer source, as well as results obtained using
LFWD and FWD as sources demonstrated that these equipments can be used
for seismic surface analysis. This findings assume great importance, specially in
the case of FWD since equipment has already mounted a deflection measuring
system consisting of 8 geophones positioned along 3 meters from the center
of the source (loading plate). Besides traditional back–analysis or even static
loading approach for the interpretation of FWD test, data gathered from these
sensors can be used to perform surface seismic analysis. This interpretation
would allow, on one hand, to confirm traditional back–analysis regarding the
number of layers and, on the other hand, the extraction of low strain modulus.

Then, analysis of moduli and state conditions was conducted. Moisture con-
tent was found have unnoticeable influence on moduli for the range of moisture
content studied, 1 to 4% dry of optimum. Conversely, dry density seems to
influence mechanical properties. Moduli increased with increasing dry density,
as long as moisture content do not vary significantly.

Comparison between full scale trial and laboratory results yielded differences
lower than 27%, laboratory moduli being higher than field moduli. This results
assumes great importance taking into account that design is based on mechanical
properties usually determined from laboratory tests.

Further, an experimental program was carried out to monitor drum roller
and layer vibrations in two phases. Phase One aimed vibrations measurement
of the capping layer during tests, namely, LFWD, FWD, Portanceme?tre and
roller drum. Accelerometers and strain gauges were buried on the capping layer
enabling measurement of dynamic response and total strains. ISAC and SP
materials were tested in this phase.

Strain measurements from SP and ISAC profiles during aforementioned tests
indicate different depths of influence, which can be ordered in increasing way:
LFWD, FWD, Portanceme?tre and roller drum. However, strain measurements



232 Field investigation: FTRE

did not always reflected moduli obtained from performance related tests. In fact,
higher strains were obtained from in–ground measurements in ISAC profile that
was found to had higher stiffness. These results were unexpected and theoretical
approach regarding LFWD and FWD tests was unable to explain these results.
On the contrary, in–ground displacements obtained from acceleration measure-
ments were consistent with profiles stiffness. Higher in–ground displacements
were found regarding SP profile than in ISAC profile, which is consistent with
lower modulus obtained in the former than the latter. Hence, in–ground dy-
namic response reflect moduli obtained from dynamic tests performed at layer
surface.

Owing to impact loads from LFWD and FWD on SP profile, in–ground
strains and displacements were consistent with theoretical approach considering
a single modulus, yet modulus obtained from both tests differed. These results
highlight the importance of test methods calibration using a reference test and
allowed to conclude higher depth of influence from plate with higher diame-
ter. Results obtained from ISAC profile did not confirmed these conclusions,
which might be attributed to stationary drum tests between impact tests which
induced significant differences on profile mechanical homogeneity.

Concerning to vibration loads induced by Portanceme?tre and roller drum on
SP profile, displacements at lower depth differed about 25%, whereas at higher
depth differed only 12%. The analysis of acceleration data denote non linear
behaviour at lower depth, while behaviour close to linear appears to prevail at
higher depth. As so, a similar dynamic in–ground response is found at higher
depth. Since roller drum and Portanceme?tre wheel dynamic behaviour reflects
dynamic in–ground response, this fact might indicate a good correlation between
mechanical properties determined from instrumented rollers and Portanceme?tre.

Phase Two involved vibrations measurement of roller drum and vibrations
of capping layer during compaction of base layer. Three different profiles were
tested, namely, one formed only by ISAC material, and the others formed
by ISAC and CA40 materials resting on SP capping layer. Two accelerom-
eters were embarked on the drum and acceleration signals were then computed
in order to obtain roller vertival movement during compaction. At the same
time, capping layer was instrumented with in–ground accelerometers and strain
gauges in order to get information of vibrations in depth. Vertical drum acceler-
ation and displacement were found to be sensitive to changes in underlying soil
stiffness. Both decreased with increasing soil stiffness for an excitation frequency
of about 19 Hz, which features drum vibration below the natural frequency of
test bed. Further, good correlation was found between drum vibration and
SPLT modulus obtained from ISAC and CA40+SP profiles. In addition, at
0.65 m depth strain levels induced by SPLT were similar to the ones induced
by roller drum, denotes identical depth of influence. These findings shows that
SPLT modulus reflect drum behaviour and, therefore, should be used as refer-
ence test.

Concerning in–ground vibrations measurements, similar trend to drum be-
haviour was found, i.e., accelerations and computed displacements decreased
within number of passes on both profiles, thus with increasing stiffness. There-
fore, in–ground dynamic response measured by means of in–ground accelerom-
eters denotes close relation to drum behaviour, as was concluded from Phase
One. On the other hand, results from in–ground strains were inconclusive.

Conclusions

8.1 Conclusions

Several aspects that governs high–speed railway embankments, which dis-
tinguishes from other conventional transportation infrastructure, like road em-
bankments, were identified. High–speed railway embankments demands an in-
frastructure exhibiting an overall stiffness that limits maximum settlements and
minimize relative settlements of the embankment platform during serviceability
conditions, in order to minimize the exploration costs, to avoid high level of
discomfort for passengers and reduce induced vibrations on surrounding struc-
tures.

These aspects include strict requirements demands of high quality construc-
tion of embankment and railtrack layers regarding material quality, state pa-
rameters and mechanical properties limits, promoting homogeneity of mechan-
ical behaviour of compacted layers. As mentioned in Chapter 2 requirements
increase from bottom to top layers. The embankment layers should provide
a stable foundation for the base (subballast) and ballast layers. The range of
stiffness of the capping layers is believed to influence ballast, rail and sleeper de-
terioration, since the influence of the traffic induced stresses extends downwards
as much as 5 meters below the bottom of the sleepers. Hence, embankment lay-
ers are a very important substructure component which as a significant influence
on track performance and maintenance. Base layer (subballast) assumes great
importance due to several aspects, e.g. to ensure better distribution of loads, to
protect the underlying layer against erosion, to avoid seepage into the underly-
ing layer and to prevent the penetration of fine soil material into the track bed,
especially to the ballast.

Furthermore, strict requirements on quality construction demands higher
quality on materials compaction control. From the literature review, it was
concluded that there is a strong trend towards using performance based proper-
ties like stiffness and strength to assess layer compaction (Briaud, 2001; Loizos
et al., 2003; Alshibli et al., 2005; Edil and Sawangsurya, 2005). These proper-
ties are a measure of quality since non–uniformity of stiffness and/or strength is
directly related to progressive failures and life–cycle cost. Moreover, the design
method of layer systems is based on engineering parameters of materials such
as their stiffness and/or strength, which results in a missing link between the

233



234 Conclusions

design process and construction quality assessment.
Increasing demands for better, cheaper and faster compaction assessment

have lead to technology improvements. In this context, equipments for field test
evaluation of mechanical properties of geomaterials have been recently devel-
oped, such as, impact tests (Falling Weight Deflectometer – FWD and Light
Falling Weight Deflectometer – LFWD), the Soil Stiffness Gauge (SSG), Spec-
tral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW). These are non–destructive spot tests
which can be conducted independently and in conjunction with conventional
moisture density testing improving statistical evaluation and allowing variability
reduction, thus substantially enhance construction quality of the entire earth-
work (Edil and Sawangsurya, 2005). Moreover, equipments enabling continuous
evaluation of layer stiffness, like Portanceme?tre, had been developed which rep-
resents a great improvement on platform quality. However, these equipments
are not standardized and requires comparison to the reference test given on
specifications, usually static plate load test (SPLT) following either AFNOR
NF P94–117–1 (2000) or DIN 18134 (2001) before CEN standards will be avail-
able.

Moreover, railway embankments and railtrack layers are constructed on com-
pacted geomaterials that are typically in unsaturated condition during construc-
tion and may remain in that condition during the working life of the struc-
ture. Several design and maintenance measures are undertaken to maintain
unsaturated conditions because they provide favorable engineering materials
properties, namely strength and stiffness. The literature review showed that
compaction conditions (moisture content, compaction energy and compaction
technique) strongly influence the hydro–mechanical behaviour of unsaturated
geomaterials, namely, strength and stiffness, due to suction effect. However, the
hydro–mechanical behaviour of unsaturated geomaterials is not straightforward
due to the presence of suction and, even at critical states, the results found on
literature are contradictory. Therefore, a better understanding of the hydro–
mechanical behaviour of compacted layers requires both laboratory and field
investigations.

In the scope of the present work laboratory and field evaluation of influ-
ence of compaction conditions on the hydro–mechanical behaviour of different
geomaterials was carried out. In what follows the main achievements will be
pointed out.

8.1.1 Laboratory investigation

Throughout a laboratory investigation the influence of compaction condi-
tions, namely, molding water content, on hydro–mechanical behaviour of geo-
materials was evaluated. Emphasis was given to mechanical characterization,
particularly regarding to clayey sand (SC) material, since it has a non negligi-
ble fine fraction. The same procedure was employed on all tests to study both
materials. Specimens were compacted with the same initial void ratio but with
different molding water contents and tested in unsaturated condition. Further
also saturated and dry tests were carried out.

The hydro–characterization of SC material was carried out by means of fil-
ter paper technique. Tests showed good repeatability and, thereby, filter paper
technique proved to be an easy and low cost method to determine water re-
tention curve. Molding water content was found to strongly influences matric



Conclusions 235

suction that, in turn, play an important role on the mechanical behaviour of SC
material. Compressibility of SC specimens was found to be suction indepen-
dent in the lower stress range, before yielding. On the contrary, in the higher
stress range after yielding, curves shapes from unsaturated specimens seems to
be suction dependent: the higher the suction, the lower is the compressibility.
This was confirmed by isotropic compressibility of unsaturated samples which
increased with increasing water content. As so, an increasing suction produces a
stiffening of the material with smaller plastic compressibility. However, during
unloading sequences, compressibility appeared to be suction independent for the
compacted unsaturated specimens. The data confirm the general findings that
an increased suction produces a stiffening of the material with smaller plastic
compressibility (Alonso et al., 1990; Cui and Delage, 1996), despite the tight
differences observed between unsaturated tests.

As far as what concerns to SC, a strong influence of molding water content
on the mechanical behaviour was found at both large and very small strain do-
main, namely regarding strength and stiffness parameters, which is attributed
to suction effect. Strength and stiffness increases with decreasing molding water
content, i.e, with increasing suction. However, for the same state conditions,
strength and stiffness was found to decrease with increasing stress and strain lev-
els, which is due to a reduction of suction effect. In what concerns to strength,
these trends agrees with the ones found by Estabragh et al. (2004) and dif-
fers from Alonso et al. (1990). Stress–strain curves featuring materials in a
dense sate were obtained. Critical state had been reached in unsaturated and
saturated tests and a similar internal friction angle at critical state (?cs) was
found, thus material behaviour at critical state is independent of initial satura-
tion condition. Concerning to stiffness, similar trends were found by Fleureau
et al. (2003). It is noteworthy that stiffness degradation curves were found to
lie between a reference threshold shear strain given by Santos (1999). As so, the
material characterization on the very small and large strain domain enabled to
estimate stiffness for any strain domain.

A stress–strain non linear behaviour featuring material in a dense state was
also observed from crushed aggregate (CA31.5) specimens. However, slight in-
fluence of molding water content on the mechanical behaviour was found at large
strain domain, which indicates little influence of suction effect on strength and
stiffness in the range of molding water content studied. This is probably due
to a negligible fine fraction. Unsaturated specimens denoted higher britleness
behaviour, corresponding higher secant friction angles. However, in contrast
to SC material, specimen with optimum molding water content presented the
highest friction angle and saturated specimens the lowest. Once again, differ-
ences become lower with increasing total mean stress level. Critical state had
been reached only for saturated test. Concerning to stiffness, no significant dif-
ferences on specimens stiffness were found for strain and stress levels evaluated.
To this end, suction seems not to play an important role on CA31.5 material
stiffness for the studied compaction conditions.

Further, multistage procedure was found to provide good results regarding
peak deviatoric stresses, as long as no significant structure disturbance is exper-
imented at each stage. However, stress–strain curves present higher britleness
behaviour rather than triaxial single stage tests.

Finally, as far as what concerns to tests on the very strain domain a setup
using bender elements and accelerometers was attempted. Comparison between



236 Conclusions

results obtained using BE and accelerometers showed that, generally, results
obtained with both sensors slightly differs, with exception to the specimen with
higher moisture content where significant differences were found. The inves-
tigation of travel time determination showed that picking arrival time from
both accelerometers is straight, whereas picking bender elements arrival point
is ambiguous. This difficulty, probably due to near–field effects amplified by a
high degree of saturation, led to pick the wrong arrival time, thus to mislead
computation of S–wave velocity. Therefore, the measurement of S–waves us-
ing accelerometers as receivers appears to improve measurements quality in the
time domain, particularly concerning quasi–saturated specimens.

8.1.2 Field investigation: E?vora trial railway embankment
(ETRE)

A full scale trial was carried out involving two type of geomaterials, SC and
CA31.5. Trial layers with different thicknesses (0.22, 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 m)
and different moisture contents (2% dry of optimum, optimum and 2% wet
of optimum Modified Proctor) were constructed. Then, evaluation of state
conditions and mechanical properties for several energy levels were carried out
and statistical data was computed.

State conditions were evaluated by means of sand cone method (SCM) and
nuclear method (NM), the latter requiring calibration. Regarding SC trial
layers, average moisture content of trial layers ranged from 3% dry of optimum
to 1.5% wet of optimum, which reflects a deviation from previously planned.
Further, statistical data showed higher moisture content coefficient of variation
(CV) from SC trial layers compacted dry of optimum, rather than SC trial layers
compacted with moisture content wet of optimum. Concerning to CA31.5 trial
layers, moisture content 1% wet of optimum was achieved on layer with 0.22 m
thickness, whereas moisture content close to optimum value was achieved on
trial layer with 0.30 m thickness. Moreover, moisture content strongly varied
within increasing energy level. In fact, moisture content obtained from both
layers for the first enelgy level was about 1.5% dry of optimum.

As so, the previous stack of material, water adding and mix up by means
of a front shovel did not reproduced the desirable moisture contents nor even
the desirable homogeneity. It should be noted that the adverse weather con-
ditions during construction of some trial layers might had contributed to these
results. This notwithstanding, dry density CV lie below maximum values given
by Brandl (1977), with exception to SC trial layer with 0.50 m thickness. To
this end, layer with 0.50 m thickness does not fulfill quality control requirements
of high quality projects, namely those regarding high speed embankments. Fur-
ther, layer thickness was found to influence relative compaction of SC trial layers
for the compaction equipment and energy levels studied. Relative compaction
decreased with increasing layer thickness.

Mechanical evaluation was carried out by means of static plate load test
(SPLT) and performance related tests, namely, Soil Stiffness Gauge (SSG),
light falling weight deflectometer (LFWD), falling weight deflectometer (FWD),
spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW) and Portanceme?tre.

Focus was given to the evaluation of mechanical properties by means of
SPLT which were performed following two commonly used standards,AFNOR
NF P94–117–1 (2000) and DIN 18134 (2001). SPLT following AFNOR was



Conclusions 237

carried out using two settlement measuring systems: one measuring settlement
on a point at the center of the plate through a hole; another measuring settle-
ment three concentric points on the periphery of the plate. Results from the
former measuring systems were found to be more than 30% higher than corre-
sponding values obtained with the latter. Therefore, measuring settlement on
a point at the center of the plate through a hole is not recommended. Fur-
thermore, analysis of both standards was performed and differences concerning
to test proceed and test interpretation was found. Comparison between results
obtained from direct interpretation of SPLTs following AFNOR NF P94–117–1
(2000) and DIN 18134 (2001) standards showed a difference between moduli of
approximately 10%, where values obtained from DIN standard were the highest.
However, differences between standards regarding stress level and method of in-
terpretation were observed. Thus, interpretation for same stress level (200 kPa)
and method (secant method) was conducted. In this case modulus given by
tests performed following DIN standard were 15% lower than the ones achieved
by tests performed following AFNOR standard. In addition, equivalent modu-
lus should take into account different plates diameter if a multi–layered system
is being tested. Conclusions regarding SPLT led to the specification project
(Gomes Correia et al., 2007) that is presented in Appendix B.

The analysis of the results from several tests methods to evaluate moduli
allowed to establish correlations and testify equipment calibrations using SPLT
as reference test. Good correlation between SPLT and Portanceme?tre moduli
was established for SC trial layers, the latter being about 10% higher than the
former. Although a correlation close to unity was obtained between SPLT and
LFWD on SC trial layers, high scatter led to poor correlation. Thereby, results
from this equipment should be treated with caution. No correlation was found
between SPLT and the others performance related tests. Results from CA31.5
trial layers did not allowed to establish correlations between SPLT as reference
test and performance related tests. Therefore, equipments calibration for each
kind of material is required.

These results indicate the huge potential of Portanceme?tre for the continu-
ous stiffness evaluation on earthwork platforms, being a non destructive method
easy to operate enabling quick evaluation of moduli and large number of tests,
which allows statistical analysis. Moreover, the instantly layout of moduli en-
ables immediate intervention ever quality control requirements are not achieved.
In addition, afterwards treatment of results allows spacial characterization of
full area of compacted layer. Thereby, mechanical evaluation by means of Por-
tanceme?tre represents a great improvement on quality control/quality assurance
(Qa/Qc) of compacted layers.

Then, the influence of state conditions on the mechanical properties was
evaluated. In what concerns to SC trial layers no moduli was found to decrease
with increasing moisture content confirming, thus reflecting suction effect on
mechanical properties. Indeed, this trend is consistent with laboratory results.
Further, Portanceme?tre moduli CV decreased with increasing moisture content.
These results denote the great influence of moisture content either on average
moduli and on homogeneity of mechanical performance of layers embankment.
No clear relationship between dry density and moduli was found. With regards
to CA31.5 trial layers, moduli was found to follow moisture content variation.
Moduli increased with increasing moisture content, as long as moisture content
varies between about 2% dry of optimum and optimum value. This trend indi-



238 Conclusions

cates the great influence of moisture content on mechanical performance rather
than dry density. It is noteworthy that the highest modulus was obtained for
moisture content close to optimum value, which is consistent with results from
laboratory results once again.

To sum up, great influence of moisture content was found either on average
moduli and homogeneity rather than density. As so, higher requirements regard-
ing compaction control should be considered regarding moisture content rather
than dry density, particularly when compaction is performed with moisture
content on the dry side as long as compacted layers will remain in unsaturated
condition. Further, since mechanical properties reflect moisture conditions, con-
tinuous evaluation of mechanical performance represents a great improvement
on compaction control. This fact highlights the great benefit using continuous
compaction control devices like Portanceme?tre.

Finally, comparison between full scale trial and laboratory results was per-
formed. A perfect match between shear modulus obtained from SASW and
shear modulus given by laboratory tests was found. In addition, a maximum
difference of 19% between modulus obtained from SPLT following AFNOR stan-
dard and modulus estimated from triaxial compression tests was found. These
findings assumes great importance taking into account two issues: (i) design is
based on mechanical properties usually determined from laboratory tests; (ii)
even though conventional triaxial tests only allow determination of mechanical
properties beyond strain level of 1%, for SC geomatrial is possible to estimate
secant modulus from degradation curves for lower strain levels since degradation
curves lie between reference threshold for sands given by Santos (1999).

8.1.3 Field investigation: Fafe trial road embankment
(FTRE)

Another full scale trial was performed. Three types of materials were stud-
ied, namely, poor–graded sand (SP) used in trial and embankment layers, inert
steel aggregate for construction (ISAC) used in trial, embankment and base
layers and crushed aggregate (CA40) used in base layers. However, only SP
and ISAC were used in trial layers, which were constructed at optimum water
content with varying thicknesses compacted with different energy levels. Like-
wise in ETRE, a full scale trial was carried out involving state conditions and
mechanical properties evaluation.

State conditions were obtained from SCM, rubber balloon method (RBM)
and NM tests, the last requiring calibration. NM was found to be inappropriate
to determine state conditions of ISAC layers.

Moisture content of SP trial layers ranged over 3–4% dry of optimum, whereas
embankment layers varied between 1 and 3% dry of optimum. The wetting pro-
cess employed on SP material which involved the previous stack of material,
watter adding and mix up by means of a front shovel and, in addition, in situ
moisture content correction before compaction process, did not reproduced de-
sirable moisture conditions close to optimum. The highest moisture content CV
was obtained from trial layer with 0.50 m thickness, which denotes the influence
of layer thickness on moisture content homogeneity. Nevertheless, dry density
CV was less than 3% for all layers, which lie below limit given by Brandl (1977).

Focus was given to the analysis of the results from tests methods to evaluate
moduli. Correlations between moduli obtained from LFWD, SSG, FWD, SASW



Conclusions 239

and Portanceme?tre using SPLT as reference test were attempted. Concerning
to SP material, though the data is limited, a general relationship between SPLT
modulus (EV2) and Portanceme?tre (EPort) moduli close to unity was found once
again. This means that results given by these tests are approximately the same
validating the calibration method used. Correlation between SPLT and other
performance related tests showed differences higher than 55%. As so, due to
lack of results of SPLT, Portanceme?tre was used as reference test to confirm
correlations based on a greater number of points. However, high scatter did
no enable sustainable conclusions. As mentioned previously, the results from
LFWD and SSG equipment should be treated with caution.

With regards to ISAC material different conclusions were obtained. Moduli
given by SPLT (EV2) and Portanceme?tre (EPort) differed approximately 45%.
Once more, due to lack of SPLT tests, Portanceme?tre was used as reference
test. Correlation between LFWD and ‘Portanceme?tre” moduli was close to
unity (only differs 12%), while between SSG and Portanceme?tre moduli differs
30%, yet high scatter was observed. Concerning to CA40+SP profile due to lack
of results no sustainable conclusions were obtained. This shows the necessity of
equipments calibration for each kind of material. Though it seems possible to
establish correlations between moduli of in situ performance–based tests meth-
ods, material type and state conditions should be taken into account on this
evaluation.

SASW were carried out on SP embankment layer using different sources
types, namely light hammer, sledge hammer and LFWD and FWD equipments.
Good results were obtained using light hammer source, LFWD and FWD as
sources. This findings assume great importance, specially in the case of FWD
since equipment has already mounted a deflection measuring system consisting
of 8 geophones positioned along 3 meters from the center of the source (loading
plate). Besides traditional back–analysis or even static loading approach for the
interpretation of FWD test, data gathered from these sensors can be used to
perform surface seismic analysis. This interpretation would allow, on one hand
to confirm traditional back–analysis regarding the number of layers and, on the
other hand, the extraction of modulus on the very small strain domain.

Then, analysis of moduli and state conditions was conducted. In contrast to
conclusions obtained from ETRE, moisture content was found have unnoticeable
influence on moduli for the range of moisture content studied, 1 to 4% dry of
optimum. Conversely, dry density seems to influence mechanical properties.
Moduli increased with increasing dry density, as long as moisture content do not
vary significantly. However, no relation between dry density CV and modulus
CV was found.

Comparison between full scale trial and laboratory results yielded differences
lower than 27%, laboratory moduli being higher than field moduli. This results
assumes great importance taking into account that design is based on mechanical
properties usually determined from laboratory tests.

Further, an experimental program was carried out to monitor drum roller
and layer vibrations in two phases. Phase One aimed vibrations measurement
of the capping layer during tests, namely, LFWD, FWD, Portanceme?tre and
roller drum. Accelerometers and strain gauges were buried on the capping layer
enabling measurement of dynamic response and total strains. ISAC and SP
materials were tested in this phase.

Stain measurements from SP and ISAC profiles during aforementioned tests



240 Conclusions

indicate different depths of influence, which can be ordered in increasing way:
LFWD, FWD, Portanceme?tre and roller drum. However, strain measurements
did not always reflected moduli obtained from performance related tests, since
higher strains were obtained from in–ground measurements in ISAC profile that
was found to had higher stiffness. On the contrary, in–ground displacements
obtained from acceleration measurements were consistent with profiles stiffness.
Higher in–ground displacements were found regarding SP profile than in ISAC
profile, which is consistent with lower modulus obtained in the former than the
latter. Hence, in–ground dynamic response was found to reflect moduli obtained
from dynamic tests performed at layer surface.

Comparison between in–ground strains and displacements during impact
loads LFWD and FWD on SP profile, showed consistency with theoretical ap-
proach considering a single modulus, yet modulus obtained from both tests
differed. These results highlight the importance of test methods calibration us-
ing a reference test. Moreover, it allowed to conclude higher depth of influence
from plate with higher diameter. Results obtained from ISAC profile did not
confirmed these conclusions, which might be attributed to stationary drum tests
between impact tests which induced significant differences on profile mechanical
homogeneity.

Analysis of in–ground accelerations during Portanceme?tre and roller drum
passes on SP profile exhibited non linear behaviour at depth of 0.10 m, while
behaviour close to linear appears to prevail at depth of 0.45 m. Moreover, quite
similar in–ground vibrations were found at higher depth, which denotes similar
dynamic in–ground response. Since roller drum and Portanceme?tre wheel dy-
namic behaviour reflects dynamic in–ground response, this fact might indicate a
good correlation between mechanical properties determined from instrumented
rollers and Portanceme?tre.

Owing to the roller drum behaviour monitoring during stationary vibration
tests, comparison between drum acceleration given by both sensors (one located
at the top and middle of the drum and another located at the left side of the
non–rotating mount) slightly differed for low eccentric static moments and was
almost the same for higher static moments. Acceleration measured at the top
middle of the drum was greater and signal noise level was lower. Approximated
displacements obtained from sensor on the left side were 85% lower than the ones
obtained from sensor at the top middle. Since continuous compaction control
(CCC) based on roller drum measurments uses displacements obtained from
computed acceleration signals, this difference should be taking into account on
stiffness determination.

Phase Two involved vibrations measurement of roller drum and vibrations of
capping layer during compaction of base layer. Vertical drum acceleration and
displacement were found to be sensitive to changes in underlying soil stiffness.
Both decreased with increasing soil stiffness for an excitation frequency of about
19 Hz, which features drum vibration below the natural frequency of test bed.
Further, good correlation was found between drum vibration and SPLT modulus
obtained from ISAC and CA40+SP profiles. In addition, at 0.65 m depth strain
levels induced by SPLT were similar to the ones induced by roller drum, denotes
identical depth of influence. These findings shows that SPLT modulus is related
to drum behaviour and, therefore, should be used as reference test.

Concerning in–ground vibrations measurements, similar trend to drum be-
haviour was found, i.e., accelerations and computed displacements decreased

within number of passes on both profiles, that is the same to say with increas-
ing stiffness. Therefore, in–ground dynamic response measured by means of
in–ground accelerometers denotes close relation to drum behaviour, as was con-
cluded from Phase One. On the other hand, results from in–ground strains were
inconclusive.

8.2 Prospective work

As future work hydro–mechanical behaviour of SC geomaterial in unsatu-
rated condition should be investigated using suction measurement apparatus in
order to get a better insight on the interpretation of both laboratory and field
results. On one hand, it would allow effective stress analysis and validate matric
suction obtained from filter paper method and, on the other hand, to validate
theoretical effective stress approaches.

Taking into account the apparent influence of dry density on the mechanical
behaviour of SP material for slight variations of moisture content, a laboratory
campaign is required in order to confirm this behaviour.

The measurement of S–waves velocity by means of bender elements and ac-
celerometers requires calibration using materials with well known properties.
Further, interpretation technique of accelerometers signal in the frequency do-
main is necessary in order to compare with results obtained from time domain.

Regarding mechanical evaluation by means of field tests, full scale trials em-
ploying different materials would be useful in order to establish correlations
between mechanical tests. Further, it allows to get state parameters and me-
chanical properties variation, which information is of great interest on the be-
haviour analysis and design involving reliable analysis.

In addition, full scale trials should be performed coupled with “intelligent
rollers” promoting and validating this technology (Parente, 2010). Moreover,
investigations using in–ground sensors (strain gauges, cell pressures and ac-
celerometers) should be carried out. Vibration characteristics of the roller drum
should be continuously monitored enabling the loading action of the drum to
be characterized. This information would be then used to develop numerical
models of the interaction roller drum–material behaviour during compaction
process.

The FWD appears to be a promising device to evaluate modulus in the
very small strain domain, besides large strain domain. This equipment applies
impact loads and has already mounted a deflection measuring system consisting
of 8 geophones positioned along 3 meters from the center of the source (loading
plate). As so, besides traditional back–analysis or even static loading approach
for the interpretation of FWD test, data gathered from these sensors could
be used to perform seismic analysis of surface waves. This interpretation would
allow the extraction of low strain modulus. This would represent a great benefit
on the mechanical evaluation of road and railway platforms.

Background on the
measurement of stiffness at
small strain using dynamic
methods

A.1 Introduction

The basic principles and methods for determining soil stiffness at very small
strain rely on wave propagation phenomena in a linear elastic medium (Ishihara,
1996). If an oscillating loading is applied to a homogeneous unbounded elastic
space, two types of waves will emanate from the loading: volumetric waves and
surface waves.

From the two types of volumetric waves generated from an energy source,
the one of most interest in this study is the shear wave. Since the pore fluid
does not have shear stiffness, only the soil skeleton propagates S–waves. As a
result, the shear modulus G of a material is related to the velocity of a shear
wave through it by:

G = ? · V 2s (A.1)

where ? is the density.

For an isotropic elastic soil the effective stress elastic parameters are related
by:

E = 2 · G · (1 + ?) (A.2)

On contrast, P–waves can be propagated also by the pore fluid. Therefore,
in saturated, unconsolidated materials, P–wave velocities are often controlled
by the bulk stiffness of water.

There are several ways to obtain the shear modulus either in the field or
in laboratories in the small strain domain. In situ methods to determine shear
modulus are generally described as a part of geophysical surveying, they all have

259



the principle of sending waves through the ground and recording them in differ-
ent points, and the wave distortion and speed are interpreted to give information
about the soil from which they pass. There are many methods available to cre-
ate artificial waves like the Cross–Hole (CH) and Down–Hole (DH) methods,
the seismic cone penetration test (SCPT) and the spectral analysis of surface
waves (SASW).

Measurement of soil stiffness in laboratory throughout the small strain (about
10?5 up to 10?3) can be made using local gauges attached directly to the spec-
imen (Goto et al., 1991; Hoque et al., 1997), while throughout very small strain
range (strains below 10?5) can be made using dynamic methods, such as reso-
nant column and bender element method (Santos, 1999; Ferreira, 2008). Since
bender elements were used in laboratory tests, only bender element method will
be focused.

A bender element is a piece of piezo–ceramic elements which distort or bends
if a voltage across it is changed or, if bent by an external force, the voltage across
it changes. The transducers are made of bimorphs in which two sheets of piezo-
electric material are fused together. When a voltage is applied to it, depending
on the materials polarity, it will either contract or expand, and similarly when
it expands or contracts it produces a voltage. Therefore if a voltage is applied
to both sides of the bender element, one side will lengthen while the other will
shorten. This in turn will cause the bender element to flex in one direction, and
then in the opposite direction when the voltage is reversed as shown in Figure
A.1.

Bender elements may be assembled to operate in two different ways: parallel
or series (fig. A.1). In parallel bimorphs, the electrodes are on the outside
of each plate, but these are connected together to the same terminal and the
central conductor is connected to the other terminal. The plates are polarized in
the same direction in this case. In series bimorphs the electrodes on the outside
of each plate are connected to a voltage source and the plates are polarised
in opposite direction. They develop twice the voltage of those connected in
parallel for the same driving force and they provide only half the displacement
of parallel elements for the same applied voltage. To this end, a suitable setting
should use a parallel bender element as the source and a series bimorph as the
receiver.

Bender elements are usually set into the top and bottom platens of a triaxial
or oedometer cell and penetrate into the specimen a small distance. Mounted as
cantilever beams, one element is vibrated by changing the voltage across it. The
motion of the bender element initiates a shear wave to propagate through the
soil specimen. When the shear wave reaches bender element some distance away,
it causes it to flex and thus producing a voltage between the electrodes. The
input voltage (created using a function generator) and the received signal are
monitored using a digital oscilloscope, allowing the travel time to be determined.
Then, velocity can be computed using following Equation:

V =
L

t
(A.3)

where V is the wave velocity, L is the distance between the tips of source and
receiver bender elements, and t is the travel time. The dynamic elastic shear
(G) and Young (E) moduli can then be determined through equations A.1 and

260

bimorph bender element

A.2.
Although in principle the use of bender elements appears to be straight for-

ward, in practice their use can lead to ambiguous and uncertain results. This
has led to a great deal of research focused on the principles and assumptions
underlying their use. The convenience of bender element tests is limited by
subjectivity associated with identifying wave travel time and uncertainties sur-
rounding the validity of some interpretation methods. Doubts exist regarding
the influence of transducer support conditions on the characteristics of transmit-
ted waves and the importance of reflected components on received waveforms
(Dyvik and Madshus, 1985; Brignoli et al., 1996; Viggiani and Atkinson, 1995).
The received signals can be distorted by near field effects, cross–talking and
sample size effects.

A.2 Near–field effects

The first deflection of the signal may not correspond to the arrival of the shear
wave but to the arrival of the so–called near–field component which travels with
the velocity of a compression wave (Sa?nchez-Salinero et al., 1986).

Theoretical studies on three–dimensional transmission of waves through an
infinitive elastic body have been performed and described in detail by Sa?nchez-
Salinero et al. (1986). They presented fundamental equation solution for shear
waves which are composed of three terms. In a simplified form shear wave
components can be generally represented as:

S = Sfar?field, traveling at Vs + Snear?field, traveling at Vs
+Snear?field, traveling at Vp

(A.4)

In simplified terms, two of the components of a shear wave propagate at
the shear wave velocity Vs, while the other component propagates at the com-
pression wave velocity Vp. The terminology “far–field” and “near–field” denote
different attenuations with distance. The near–field components attenuate much

261



faster than the far–field so, although their contribution is important very near to
the source, it rapidly decreases with distance from the source. Analytical studies
of this phenomenon can be found in Arroyo et al. (2003) and Rio (2006).

From the previous can be concluded that these near–field effects may mask
the arrival of the shear wave when the receiver is located at a near distance
from the source, adding difficulties when choosing the arrival point. Near–
field effects in bender element tests have been recognized by many researchers
(Viggiani and Atkinson, 1995; Brignoli et al., 1996; Jovicic et al., 1996). From
their experimental observations was showed that the near–field effect could be
reduced by increasing the frequency of the transmitted signal in such a way that
at least two wavelengths should travel in the length of the specimen. This limit
is represented by the following expression:

N = Rd =
L

?
=
L · f

Vs
? 2 (A.5)

On the contrary, others have found it difficult to ever obtain a clear shear
wave arrival (Gajo et al., 1997; Pennington, 1999). These apparent problems
and the need for a definitive, objective criterion for determining shear wave
travel time from any type of input signal led Arroyo et al. (2003) to look in
more detail at the often quoted Sanchez–Salinero solution. According to their
analysis, acceptable results are found if phase or group velocity is measured at
more than about 1.6 normalized distances (or travel lengths) from the source.
The frequency adjustment to limit near–field influence has been translated into
the following expression:

flim =
Vs
?
&gt;

Vs
1.6 · L

(A.6)

A.3 Cross–talk

Cross–talk is associated to electromagnetic coupling between source and re-
ceiver bender elements. This phenomena manifests as an output signal with an
early component that is quasisimultaneous with the input signal (Santamarina
et al., 2001), as can be observed in Figure A.2. This cross–talk can be very
important in conductive soils, such as saturated soils.

Lee and Santamarina (2005) conducted an experimental study to explore
cross–talk associated with the different wiring of the transducers, either in se-
ries or in parallel–type bender elements. This problem can be overcome by
properly grounding the bender element and the use of parallel to series ben-
der element combination (Lee and Santamarina, 2005). Brocanelli and Rinaldi
(1998) improved received signal by coating the bender element with conductive
silver paint over the insulating epoxy resin and grounding it. Through a process
of trial and error, by handling the different elements of the circuit, Rio (2006)
concluded that cross–talk phenomena can occur at different points of the cir-
cuit. The physical proximity of the plugs in the electronics equipments and the
lack of grounding of the testing apparatus are some of the aspects that may
contribute to the presence of crosstalk.

Since it may sometimes be impossible to eliminate this phenomena, measures
should be taken to improve received signal. High magnitude of the output signal
results on a high signal–to–noise ratio, which enables to minimize cross–talk.

262



(a) (b)

Figure A.2: Bender element measurements in different testing setups: (a) no
evidence of cross–talk; (b) clear presence of cross-talk in the output signals
(Ferreira, 2008)

On the other hand, low amplitude of the output signal results on a low signal–
to–noise ratio which enhances this phenomena. Whenever a high amplitude of
the received signal is not achieved, additional measures should be taken by the
user for correct interpretation. One way involves choosing frequency in such a
way that at least two wavelengths should travel in the length of the specimen,
allowing to distinguish cross–talk portion of the signal from the arriving of the
true shear wave. This measure assumes greater importance if the interpretation
is performed in time domain. Another way consists on the use of numerical
tools to remove the initial portion of the signal since the frequency and location
of this error are known. Then, the equivalent filtered signals can be used for
frequency domain analyses (Rio, 2006).

Rio (2006), Kuwano et al. (2008) findings suggest that near–field effects were
unable to justify the observed measurement uncertainty. To some extent these
limitations have been related to sample size effects, which importance in bender
testing has been signaled by other researchers (Blewett et al., 2000; Arroyo et al.,
2002; Theron et al., 2003; Greening and Nash, 2004).

Propagation of waves in a confined medium is influenced by the reflection of
wave components at its boundaries. This is the case of the triaxial or oedometer
tests, where bender elements are mostly commonly installed. In the first case

263



the soil specimen is surrounded by water, oil or air, while in the second case soil
specimen is contained in a steel ring. Consequently, sample geometric properties
will determine the influence of reflection of wave components in bender element
tests. This is the same to say that so–called sample size effects will depend on
the particular test configuration.

Usually bender elements are incorporated into the upper and lower load
platens of triaxial and oedometer apparatus. In most cases, therefore, bender
tests proceed as a pulse transmission test along the sample axial direction. Ar-
royo (2001) examined in depth the problem of sample size effects in cylindrical
specimens in this configuration. Two different phenomena may play a role here:
those linked to end reflections from the loading platens, and those due to re-
flections from the lateral sample boundaries. According to Arroyo et al. (2006),
whereas the first may be incorporated with relative ease into an elastodynamic
model of the soil transmission subsystem, the second are harder to deal with,
particularly when compounded with end reflections.

In this sense Arroyo et al. (2006) and Rio (2006) showed how sample size
of cylindrical specimen due to lateral boundary reflection affects the results of
bender element test by the 3D numerical simulation. In order to establish an
analogy between boundary conditions and laboratory setups, the authors stud-
ied two cases that can be translated into two opposite types of lateral boundary
conditions: reflecting and absorbing boundaries. In general, the higher the
impedance of the confining media relative to that of the soil, the higher the pro-
portion of energy reflected back into the sample. This means that oedometer
tests with metallic boundaries will be very close to the perfectly reflecting case;
the same will apply for dry soil and triaxial conditions. The case of saturated
soil and triaxial conditions is less clear–cut, and probably intermediate between
the perfectly absorbing and perfectly reflecting conditions. These authors show
clearly the influence of the reflected wave components in the received signals.

Rio (2006) shows the simulation results for a standard triaxial specimen
(model A of 100 × 50 mm, with a slenderness of 2) and for a specimen model
B (100 × 75 mm), for the cases of reflecting (non–absorbing) and absorbing
boundaries (see fig. A.3). For the absorbing case, first arrival occurs at the
expected instant with less distortion than non–absorbing case, where first arrival
does not occurs as expected and larger distortions of response can be observed.
The author also shows that response of the non–absorbing model results from the
overlap of responses for non–absorbing and absorbing conditions. This proofs
the importance of wave reflection caused by sample geometry and boundary
conditions, which are complex issues, especially for the interpretation of BE
results in the time domain (Ferreira, 2008).

Arroyo et al. (2006) also simulated cylindrical specimens with different slen-
dernesses and absorbing and non–absorbing boundaries conditions. Figure A.4a
presents the same representative section for the Ba (200 × 50 mm) and Aa
(100 × 50 mm) models with absorbing lateral boundaries. The time histories
are very similar. The same happens for the Bna and Ana models with non–
absorbing lateral boundaries, as shown by the sections in Figure A.4b. Joint
consideration of these figures shows the striking differences in the wave shapes
induced when the nature of the lateral boundaries is changed. The sections in
Figure A.4c show that there was indeed no appreciable difference between mod-
els Ca and Cna (model with dimensions 100 × 400 mm): the lateral boundaries
are so distant that they have negligible influence on the propagating motion.

et al., 2006)

A.5 Travel distance determination

The main task when using bender elements is to calculate the shear wave
velocity. Once the travel time between the transmitting and receiving bender

265



element has been measured, it should be a simple matter to calculate the shear
wave velocity, following Equation A.3, which means by diving the travel distance
by the travel time. However, there are several difficulties for travel length and
travel time determination.

The tip–to–tip distance is the most commonly assumed by a variety of au-
thors (Dyvik and Madshus, 1985; Viggiani and Atkinson, 1995; Brignoli et al.,
1996; Pennington et al., 2001), although not always justified. It corresponds to
the minimum distance between transducer tips. This assumption is supported
by data gathered with bender elements and resonant column tests by Dyvik and
Madshus (1985). They observed that the results from the bender element test
fitted best the resonant column results for travel distances measured tip–to–tip.
Viggiani and Atkinson (1995) conducted laboratory tests on samples with dif-
ferent heights. For different confining pressures the sample length was plotted
against the travel time. The chosen linear relationship between the results from
different samples, at similar stress states, indicate the correct travel distance to
be the tip–to–tip distance. Brignoli et al. (1996) performed tests with bender
elements as well as with shear–plates on samples with different heights, also
coming to the conclusion that the correct travel distance must be measured
between tip–to–tip.

Alternatives to the tip–to–tip travel distance are proposed by some authors.
Fam and Santamarina (1995) used the distance between mid–embedded height
but did not justify it. Rio (2006) conducted a series of bender element tests
on artificial polyurethane samples, covering a large range of sample heights,
travel distances and relative embedment heights. The results indicated that the
wave travel distance should be measured not between transducers tip–to–tip
but between about 60% of the transducers embedment height, coinciding with
the estimated centres of dynamic pressure exerted by the transmitter bender
element on the sample. Arulnathan et al. (1998) states that the travel time
can be also measured by comparison of the first and the second arrival of the
wave in the output signal using the second arrival method. This is possible
due to reflection at the ends of the specimen. Lee and Santamarina (2005)
uses multiple reflections method where the S–wave reflections from end plates
are enhanced by maximizing the soil–plate impedance mismatch. The authors
state that this method solves uncertainty not only in travel time but also in
travel distance: as shown in Figure A.5, the travel distance between the first
and the second event is always the twice the plate–to–plate distance given by
the following expression.

dpp = 2 (L + 2Lb) (A.7)

The tip–to–tip distance has been herein adopted. During the course of a
test, the deformation experienced by the specimen was taken into account, and
included in the computation of travel length.

A.6 Travel time determination

The determination of the travel time is more controversial. Determination of
travel times of elastic waves from bender elements for calculus of the shear wave
velocity of laboratory soil specimens may be done using time domain techniques
and frequency domain techniques (Dyvik and Madshus, 1985; Brignoli et al.,

266



Figure A.5: Multiple–reflection method (Lee and Santamarina, 2005)

1996; Ferreira, 2003). Jovicic (2003) claims that the measurement should be
taken in the time domain preferably directly from the screen because automatic
interpretation of arrival times using numerical processing (frequency domain)
usually does not consider changes in boundary conditions during the course of
a test. In contrast, Ferreira (2003) indicates that time domain techniques seem
to overestimate shear wave velocity and G0.

Regarding time domain technique, this method of interpretation assumes
plane wave–fronts and the absence of any reflected or refracted waves (Arul-
nathan et al., 1998). A typical output signal gathered from a step input signal
is presented in A.6.

Figure A.6: Typical S–wave signal within near field: (A) first deflection, (B)
first bump maximum, (C) zero after first bump, and (D) major first peak (Lee
and Santamarina, 2005)

Identifying at which point the shear wave arrives (A, B, C or D) is open to
user interpretation. The problem arises due to a phenomena described previ-
ously, such as near field and sample size effects. Suggested criteria and recom-
mendations vary depending on installation, application, and input signal (Dyvik
and Madshus, 1985; Fam and Santamarina, 1995; Viggiani and Atkinson, 1995;
Jovicic et al., 1996; Lee and Santamarina, 2005; Arroyo et al., 2006). Although
point A indicates the very first deflection of the shear wave, it has contrary
polarity. As mentioned above, this phenomenon is assigned to dispersion, either
by near–field effects or wave reflections at the boundary conditions. Hence, this
point does not correspond to the first arrival of the shear wave. The first arrival
of the shear wave is most likely located between points B and C. Point B is
located at the first trough of the wave, at the start of the main sinusoidal cycle,
while point C is located where the main cycle crosses zero, as depicted in the

267



figure by the zero intercept dashed line. Herein point B adopted as the arrival
time.

Alternative methods in time domain technique were explored by Arulnathan
et al. (1998) and Lee and Santamarina (2005) based on second arrival of the
output. As mentioned previously, this is possible due to reflection at the ends
of the specimen. However, second arrival of the wave is often undetected in the
signal, since it contains less energy than the first arrival. That is the case of
standard triaxial tests with high specimens due to large travel distances. In this
research specimens of 200 mm high were used and, therefore, this method was
not applied.

Alternative signal processing procedures have been explored to avoid “pick-
ing” a travel time, including cross correlation and frequency domain analyses.
For further details one should consult Ferreira (2008).

As has been noted, time domain techniques are generally simple and straight-
forward, as the travel time can be directly defined from the measurement of the
time interval between characteristic points in the transmitted and received wave
traces. However, the input signal is given by the function generator and may not
exactly correspond to the input bender element signal (Lee and Santamarina,
2005). Besides, near–field and sample size effects contributes to distortion of
the output signal and leads to misinterpretation. On the other hand, frequency
domain techniques tend to be more elaborate, as these are supported by signal
processing and spectrum analyses tools, and enable automated data acquisition
and processing. However, computed signals are not of “same nature”, which
also may lead to misinterpretation.

In this sense, Ferreira (2008) found that the exclusive use of either method
proved to be unreliable. Therefore, a practical framework for bender element
testing was recently proposed by Viana da Fonseca et al. (2009), combining two
distinct interpretation methods, in the time and the frequency domain, as a
means to effectively reduced the uncertainty and subjectivity often associated
with bender elements testing and obtain the most reliable value for the travel
time.

The issues highlighted above can be overcome if two sensors acting as re-
ceivers are used. Ferreira et al. (2010) proposed the instrumentation of spec-
imens with two accelerometers in combination with bender elements. In this
setup, the signal produced by the bender element transmitter is acquired by
the bender element receiver and by the two accelerometers. The advantages of
this setup are twofold: i) the interpretation of the acceleration measurements
can be directly made both in the time and in the frequency domain, since the
signals are of the same nature; ii) these measurements can be used to verify the
bender element signals, and thus minimize the subjectivity of the interpretation
of bender element results.

1. SCOPE 

With the present specification project is intended to describe the plate load test 

principle, equipment, procedures and results interpretation from static loading on a rigid 

plate. This test enable the determination of modulus known as “deformation modulus 

under static plate loading” of platforms. 

This test is intended for use in earthworks and infrastructures of roads, railways and 

airports, where maximum material dimension under the plate do not exceed ¼ plate 

diameter. 

This specification project specifies a method which permits the relationship between 

load and settlement to be determined, the aim being to assess the deformation 

characteristics of geomaterials and determine strain modulus. The maximum modulus 

value to be measured with this test is 250 MPa. The deformation modulus under static 

plate loading does not features the relative compaction of platforms.

p. 6 de 10 

6. TEST PROCEDURE 

 

6.1. TEST SETUP 

Record measurement point coordinates. Test area with 0,7 m x 0,7 m shall be levelled 

with rule. A clean sand layer shall be put on the test area and spread and levelled with 

trowel in such a way to achieve a thin layer. 

The loading plate shall lie in the center of this surface in full contact with the material 

being tested. This may be achieved by rotating the plate back and forth in angles of 30 

to 45º. 

The loading device shall be placed centrally on the loading plate beneath the reaction 

loading system and measuring device shall be placed accordingly the requirements 

given in sections 5.3 and 5.4. 

If necessary protection element against weather conditions shall be installed. 

 

6.2. PRELOADING 

Prior to starting the test, the strain gauge and the dial gauge or displacement transducer 

shall be set to zero and the plate preloaded for about 30 seconds. The load applied shall 

correspond to a normal stress of 0,01 MPa 600 mm plate. The reading of the gauge or 

transducer at this load shall be taken as zero reading. 

 

6.3. LOADING AND UNLOADING 

The load shall be applied in not less than six stages, in approximately equal increments, 

until the required maximum normal stress is reached. Each increase in load (from stage 

to stage) shall be completed within one minute. The load shall be released in stages, to 

50% and 25% of the maximum load and then to the load corresponding to the zero 

reading. Following that, a further (2nd) loading cycle shall be carried out, in which the 

load is to be increased only to the penultimate stage of the first cycle (see Figure 2).

Figure 2 – Load-settlement curve for determination of deformation modulus, Ev2. 
 

When testing soil, the time interval between the application of each load increment shall 

be two minutes, the load being held constant during this period.  

If a test proceeds in an unexpected manner (e.g. if the loading plate tips or sinks 

rapidly), the soil at the test site shall be dug up to a depth equal to the plate diameter. If 

stones are encountered, or if the soil is of less than stiff consistency, this shall be 

recorded. 

If, during the loading cycle, a higher load than intended is inadvertently applied, this 

load shall be maintained and a note made in the records. 

NOTE: In order to check the results obtained from the second loading cycle, a third 

cycle may be carried out to the same maximum load, this being applied immediately 

after the second loading stage, without any further intermediate stages.

Factors a0, a1, a2 are obtained from adjustment of a second degree polynomial to the 

load-settlement curve, not being considered the initial value (zero).
