Abstract 

For the past few years studies of larval dispersal have been gaining notoriety, partially due to 

the innovating technologies that facilitate these kinds of works. Larval dispersal is crucial in the 

understanding of population dynamics and connectivity, which have important implications in 

the design and maintenance of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).  The marking of calcified 

tissues with the antibiotic tetracycline is a frequently used methodology in scientific studies, 

and in the past decades it has been used to study population connectivity through larval 

dispersal. The main goal of this work was to validate the procedure for tetracycline tagging of 

the otoliths of embryos of two gobiesocid species found in the Portuguese coast: Lepadogaster 

purpurea and Lepadogaster lepadogaster. This meant determining what would be the 

minimum tetracycline concentration needed to mark the larvae’s otoliths with an immersion 

time of only 30 minutes, and to assess if these immersions had any effect on the larvae’s 

survival rates. For this purpose, eggs, in the pigmented-eye stage, were immersed for 30 

minutes in different concentrated tetracycline solutions, in order to determine the appropriate 

concentration for successful marking of otoliths. In addition, the possible effects of tetracycline 

in larvae’s survival rates were also analyzed. Observation of otoliths of larvae of different ages, 

under a fluorescence microscope, showed a high percentage of autofluorescence, both in 

control and treatment samples, with no otoliths being considered as truly marked. Comparison 

of results from 30-minutes immersions and longer ones indicate that for this tagging 

technique, the immersion time also plays a key role, having the 2 and 15-hours immersions 

produced positively- tagged otoliths. However, after statistical analysis, no correlation 

between the different tetracycline treatments and the levels of mortality was found, indicating 

that this immersion in tetracycline solutions for a time period of 30 minutes had no effect on 

the larvae’s survival rates.

Resumo 

Recentemente, cada vez mais atenção tem sido dada à problemática da perda da 

biodiversidade dos ambientes marinhos, assim como da depleção dos stocks de pesca. Uma 

solução encontrada é a criação de Zonas Marinhas Protegidas (ZMP). Porém, para uma 

correcta criação e manutenção destas zonas, é necessário um profundo conhecimento da 

dinâmica existente entre as populações locais. 

A conectividade entre populações é geralmente definida como a ligação demográfica existente 

entre populações através da dispersão de indivíduos sob a forma larvar. O nível de 

conectividade entre populações determina se estas serão consideradas como 

demograficamente “abertas” ou “fechadas”. 

A maioria dos organismos marinhos possui um ciclo de vida bipartido, constituído por uma 

fase dispersiva, normalmente sob forma larvar pelágica, e uma fase bentónica, que geralmente 

se refere à fase adulta da vida do indivíduo. A fase dispersiva desempenha um papel fulcral na 

conectividade entre populações, sendo que a grande maioria da dispersão se dá nesta fase de 

vida. Assim sendo, é muito importante para uma correcta construção e manutenção das ZMP 

um bom conhecimento das ligações existentes entre as populações locais através da dispersão 

larvar. 

Tradicionalmente, as larvas de organismos marinhos eram consideradas como partículas 

passivas, não tendo qualquer papel activo sobre a sua dispersão, sendo que esta era 

maioritariamente ditada pelo seu Período Larvar Pelágico e pelas correntes oceânicas 

superficiais. Assim sendo, os estudos de dispersão larvar eram bastante mais simples, 

bastando uma análise dos padrões das correntes oceânicas superficiais para se ter uma ideia 

da conectividade entre populações. 

Porém, avanços recentes nos estudos de genética e comportamento larvar revelam que as 

populações não são tão demograficamente abertas como era de esperar se as larvas tivessem 

um papel completamente passivo na sua dispersão. Estes estudos permitiram concluir que as 

larvas desenvolvem capacidades que lhes permitem escolher a sua direcção, contrariar as 

correntes locais, e selecionar um habitat para assentar, tendo assim um papel activo na sua 

distribuição. 

Por conseguinte, os estudos de dispersão larvar assumem uma complexidade que 

anteriormente não tinham. Com o objectivo de estudar a conectividade entre as populações 

através da dispersão larvar, inúmeras metodologias de marcação foram desenvolvidas. Estas 

técnicas de marcação podem envolver marcas naturais ou artificiais.  

De entre as marcas naturais podem contar-se as marcas genéticas, que contam com a 

heterogeneidade genética naturalmente presente nas populações selvagens, ou as marcas 

geoquímicas, cuja identificação se baseia nas assinaturas isotópicas deixadas nos tecidos 

calcificados dos indivíduos pelas características fisico-químicas das diversas massas de água 

que atravessam durante a sua vida.

Já as marcas artificias, mais amplamente aplicadas, podem utilizar variados compostos 

químicos, desde os compostos fluorescentes, que serão utilizados neste trabalho, aos isótopos 

radioactivos estáveis que são transmitidos às larvas por via materna. 

Este estudo fez uso do composto químico tetraciclina. Este composto químico pode ser 

administrado de várias formas aos indivíduos marcados. No presente trabalho que consistiu na 

marcação de ovos de peixe, o método de marcação escolhido foi a imersão das posturas em 

soluções com diferentes concentrações de tetraciclina. Este composto deposita-se nos tecidos 

calcificados dos indivíduos, como os otólitos, os quais são depois visualizados sob uma luz 

fluorescente, onde assumem o aspecto de um anel brilhante. A metodologia de imersão difere 

de estudo para estudo, sendo mais frequente uma imersão mais prolongada numa solução de 

tetraciclina com uma concentração reduzida.  

O principal objectivo deste trabalho consistiu no desenvolvimento de uma metodologia de 

marcação dos otólitos das larvas destas espécies através da imersão numa solução de 

tetraciclina. Uma vez que esta metodologia tem como objectivo ser aplicada directamente no 

campo, na zona de entre-marés, durante a maré baixa, o tempo de imersão ideal seria de 30 

minutos. Neste sentido, foram testadas imersões de 30 minutos em soluções com várias 

concentrações de tetraciclina, de maneira a determinar qual a concentração mínima 

necessária para efectivamente marcar os otólitos das larvas. Paralelamente, o efeito da 

concentração de tetraciclina na mortalidade das larvas foi avaliado. 

Este trabalho teve como objecto de estudo duas espécies de Gobiesocidae frequentemente 

encontradas na costa Portuguesa: Lepadogaster purpurea (Bonaterre, 1788) e Lepadogaster 

lepadogaster (Bonaterre, 1788). Estas espécies são morfologicamente muito semelhantes, 

diferindo apenas nas épocas reprodutivas (L. purpurea reproduz-se durante o Inverno e L. 

lepadogaster durante a Primavera). Possuem uma distribuição que vai desde a costa sul da 

Escócia, no Mediterrâneo até ao Senegal. A ecologia destas espécies está muito parcamente 

estudada, provavelmente devido ao seu pequeno tamanho e ao seu habitat críptico, por baixo 

de rochas em praias de seixos rolados.  

As recolhas de ovos e adultos de L. purpurea (recolhas de Janeiro a Março) e L. lepadogaster 

(de Março a Junho) foram realizadas na praia de Alpertuche, localizada no Parque Marinho 

Luiz Saldanha, na Arrábida. Após recolha, os ovos e adultos foram levados para as instalações 

laboratoriais no Instituto Superior de Psicologia Aplicada (ISPA) em Lisboa, onde foram 

mantidos em aquários. Após o estudo concluido, todos os adultos e juvenis sobreviventes 

foram libertados no local de recolha. 

As posturas foram imersas em tetraciclina quando os ovos atingiram um estado de 

desenvolvimento em que era já possível reconhecer os olhos dos embriões pigmentados, pois 

é nesta fase que os otólitos iniciam a sua formação. Para L. purpurea foram realizadas 

imersões de 30 minutos em soluções com as seguintes concentrações: 400 mg.L
-1

; 600 mg.L
-1

; 

800 mg.L

; 1000 mg.L

 e 1400 mg.L

. Adicionalmente, várias larvas recém-eclodidas foram 

imersas em soluções de tetraciclina com 1000 mg.L

 durante 1, 2 e 15 horas para efeitos de 

controlo positivo, e desta forma avaliar visualmente a marca de fluorescência. No caso de L. 

lepadogaster foram realizadas imersões de 30 minutos com as seguintes concentrações: 600 



vii 
 

mg.L
-1

; 800 mg.L
-1

 e 1000 mg.L
-1

. Para ambas as espécies, várias posturas foram deixadas sem 

tratamento a fim de servirem como grupos controlo. 

Após marcação, as posturas foram colocadas em aquários separados, onde eclodiram e as 

larvas foram desenvolvidas. As larvas foram sacrificadas em diferentes estados de 

desenvolvimento, e conservadas em etanol a 96% a fim de posteriormente se extraírem os 

otólitos para observação ao microscópio. Diariamente o número de larvas vivas em cada 

tratamento e cada replicado foram contabilizadas, para avaliação de taxas de mortalidade. 

Depois da extracção, os otólitos foram montados em lâminas e observados num microscópio 

de fluorescência. Os otólitos do controlo positivo foram observados, de maneira a que uma 

caracterização da marca fluorescente pudesse ser realizada a fim de ser comparada com os 

resultados das outras observações. Após observação e dependendo do aspecto da sua marca 

fluorescente, os otólitos foram classificados em três categorias diferentes: 0 (“Sem 

fluorescência”), 1/0 (“Marca não nítida” ou “Com Autofluorescência”) e 1 (“Marca Nítida”). O 

tratamento com maior percentagem de otólitos classificados como 1 seria considerado o 

tratamento óptimo. 

Em termos de eficiência de marcação dos otólitos, as imersões de 30 minutos revelaram-se 

infrutíferas, não tendo nenhum otólito ficado marcado, independentemente da espécie e da 

concentração aplicada. Porém, quando se comparou os resultados das imersões de tempos 

diferentes em soluções com 1000 mg.L
-1

, observou-se um melhoramento da qualidade da 

marca fluorescente com o aumento do tempo de imersão. Ou seja, pode-se concluir que, para 

estas espécies, o sucesso de uma marcação de otólitos de larvas através da imersão de 

posturas em soluções de tetraciclina não depende só da concentração da solução, mas 

também do tempo de exposição.  

Porém, não foi encontrada nenhuma relação estatisticamente significativa entre as imersões 

de 30 minutos e as diferentes taxas de mortalidade dos respectivos grupos. Assim sendo, 

pôde-se concluir que imersões de 30 minutos em soluções de tetraciclina até 1400 mg.L
-1

 não 

afectam as taxas de mortalidade de L. purpurea, e imersões de 30 minutos em soluções com 

concentrações até 1000 mg.L
-1

 não têm efeito sobre as taxas de mortalidade de L. 

lepadogaster. 

Os resultados sugerem, desta forma, que imersões de apenas 30 minutos não marcaram os 

otólitos de larvas de L. purpurea nem de L. lepadogaster. Para o sucesso da marcação serão 

necessários tempos de imersão mais prolongados. Estudos futuros que testem diferentes 

métodos de marcação de larvas deverão ser levados a cabo.

Introduction 

Impact of human activities on fishing stocks and natural populations has been a 

pressing matter for quite some time, gaining more and more attention by scientists, 

politicians and the general public in the past few years (Sale et al., 2005; Cowen, 2007; 

Jones et al., 2007). The establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) has been 

pointed as a solution to contradict the global decline of fishery resources and 

biodiversity (Sale et al., 2005; Leis, 2006; Mora et al., 2006; Cowen et al., 2007; Jones 

et al., 2007). In order to correctly define the boundaries of these MPAs, a profound 

knowledge of the connectivity between local populations is needed.  

Population connectivity usually refers to “the demographic linking of local populations 

through the dispersal of individuals among them as larvae, juveniles or adults” (Sale et 

al., 2005). The levels of connectivity among local populations will determine whether 

they function as essentially isolated, ‘‘almost closed’’ populations, or as a 

metapopulation, with the separate dynamics of individual populations being buffered 

by subsidy of recruitment from other populations (Sale 2004).  

Therefore, the effectiveness of MPA’s as management tools is highly dependent on the 

scale of demographic connectivity of local populations. If the populations resident in 

the MPA are effectively open, they will be dependent on populations located in other 

areas to be seeded with new recruits. This way, the MPA’s populations may be 

vulnerable to events outside its borders and as a result, might not fulfill its biodiversity 

and conservation roles (Leis, 2006; Jones et al., 2007). However, the MPA may still be 

successful in fulfilling its fishery replenishment role if it exports propagules into the 

open populations of its associated fish species, thereby providing recruits to fished 

areas outside its borders. In contrast, if the fish populations of a MPA are largely self-

recruiting (closed), then because it supplies most of its own young, the MPA should be 

able to fulfill its biodiversity role, but not a fishery replenishment role (it exports few 

propagules, thus the scale of demographic connectivity is too small) (Leis, 2003). A 

third MPA may fulfill both roles by having a moderate degree of self recruitment, yet 

still be exporting large numbers of propagules to fished areas (Leis &amp;amp; Carson-Ewart, 

2003).  

 

The vast majority of marine organisms have a complex life cycle involving a change 

between a dispersive stage and a relatively sedentary benthonic life stage (McCormick 

&amp;amp; Makey, 1997; Roberts, 1997; Leis, 2002; Leis, 2006; Pineda et al., 2007). This is the 

case with marine reef fishes. Their life cycles are bipartite, being composed of a 

dispersive pelagic larval stage and a sedentary benthonic adult stage (Leis, 2002; Jones 

et al., 2009). 



2 
 

The pelagic larval phase plays an extremely important role in population dynamics and 

connectivity, fact that has been recognized since early last century (Hjort, 1926 and 

Thorson, 1946 in Levin, 2006). In order to stipulate reserve location, size and spacing, it 

is very important to understand how different areas are connected through larval 

exchange, which populations serve as source and which serve as sinks (Levin, 2006). 

Therefore, there’s a general consensus on the importance of understanding fish 

population dynamics and connectivity in designing and maintaining MPAs (Jones et al., 

2005; Levin, 2006; Roy, 2008; Jones et al., 2009), in order to maximize the protection 

to the nursery areas that provide larvae to the surrounding locations. 

To fully understand larval dispersal and population connectivity, one needs to (1) 

understand the biological and hydrodynamic processes involved in the transport of 

larvae and (2) derive larval origins and dispersal pathways using geochemical, genetic 

or artificial markers (Cowen et al., 2007).  

The time spent by the larvae in the pelagic environment is usually referred to as the 

Planktonic Larval Duration (PLD). This period starts at hatching and concludes days to 

weeks later when the larva settles and starts to adopt a benthic existence in a reef 

(Victor, 1983). The importance that the PLD phase has in the mechanisms of larval 

dispersal has been highly overestimated in the past decades (Cowen &amp;amp; Sponaugle, 

2009). Traditionally, larvae have been considered as passive elements, flowing in the 

ocean currents with the plankton (Roberts, 1997; Fuiman, 2002; Leis, 2002; Levin, 

2006). This being the case, it was assumed that all fish populations were 

demographically “open” populations, connected through larval dispersal (Roberts, 

1997; Leis, 2002; Leis, 2006). This way, a simplifying assumption (Leis, 2006) 

presupposed that larval behaviour doesn´t have any significant effect on their 

dispersal, and fish larvae are planktonic animals with little control over their 

trajectories, rather than strong-swimming nektonic animals (Leis, 2006). Being so, 

larval dispersal would be primarily dictated by their pelagic larval-stage duration and 

ocean currents (Roberts, 1983; Leis, 2006; Cowen et al., 2007). With this assumption in 

mind, the analysis of larval transport routes was much simpler. Being larval dispersal 

completely dependent of oceanic factors, all that was needed was an analysis of the 

surface current patterns. The oceanographic models were then highly used in the 

design of MPA’s, to change the protection status of reefs, and to argue that marine 

reserves can maintain both local and outer biodiversity through the supply of 

propagules (Leis, 2002).  

However, genetic and behavioural studies on reef fishes revealed that demographic 

connectivity and dispersal are not as largely-scaled as often assumed, presenting much 

more modest scales of dispersal (Jones et al., 1999; Swearer et al., 2002; Jones et al., 

2005; Pineda et al., 2007). These studies show that there are some population-isolating 

mechanisms that enhance local retention (Katz et al., 1983). In the last decade, 



3 
 

research on the early life-stages of marine fish larvae has revealed behavioural abilities 

that dethrone the simplifying assumption about the passive nature of fish larvae (Leis, 

2002; Leis, 2006).  

It was concluded that larval behaviour plays a much more relevant role in larval 

dispersal than initially thought (reviews by Leis, 2006; Pineda et al., 2007). It was found 

that fish larvae develop both swimming and sensory abilities during their pelagic 

phase, as well as behavioural mechanisms to avoid stronger currents by occupying the 

epibenthic boundary layer (Leis, 2002; Leis, 2006). This way, they are able to actively 

influence their dispersal by escaping stronger surface currents and swimming at 

speeds greater than the mean speed of currents encountered in their oceanic 

environments (Leis &amp;amp; Carson-Ewart, 1997), and this behaviour may be triggered by a 

number of different stimuli, such as reef sounds, changes in light, chemical cues or 

even floating objects such as seaweeds (Leis, 2006; Pineda et al., 2007; Kohn &amp;amp; 

Clements, 2011). Therefore, the traditional assumption that all populations are “open” 

is discredited, with populations having higher rates of retention than suspected (Leis, 

2002; Levin, 2006).   

With the purpose of estimating the dispersal rates of larvae, efforts have been made 

to develop tagging strategies for use in the aquatic system (Thorrold et al., 2002). 

These methodologies use tags applied to egg batches or newly-hatched larvae, which 

can be of an artificial nature, inserted in the larvae, or natural markings (Thorrold et 

al., 2002; 2007; Levin, 2006). Later, these individuals are recaptured when they recruit 

to the adult population, and the marked individuals are identified and accounted for. 

After this, using an extrapolation of the percentage of the population’s total larvae 

that were effectively tagged, an estimate of self-recruitment is made from the 

percentage of marked recaptured individuals (Jones, et al., 1999; 2005; Thorrold et al., 

2007). 

In order to generate successful results, the tagging method has to fulfill certain 

prerequisites (Thorrold et al., 2002): 

- Marked individuals must be unambiguously identifiable some time after the 

application of the mark. To do so, the mark has to have an appropriate 

retention time, and that all marked individuals are easily recognizable; 

- The tagging must not have any effects on the mortality, development and 

behaviour of the marked individuals. Therefore, tags must be invisible to 

predators, non-toxic and have no potential effects on the individuals; 

- The tagging techniques must allow the marking of multiple individuals at a 

time, preferably in a cost-efficient manner; 

- The mark must be quick and inexpensive to detect. 



4 
 

Both artificial and natural tags present advantages and disadvantages, but the only 

method for marking larvae that remains completely unequivocal is the presence of 

artificial tags in recaptured individuals (Thorrold et al., 2002). 

Natural tags rely on natural genetic heterogeneity or differences in environmental 

conditions to generate population-specific tags. These tags always have a more 

equivocal interpretation but, being naturally present, eliminate the need to tag the 

individuals physically. Geochemical signatures of calcifying structures and genetic 

markers fall in the category of natural tagging. The geochemical markings are 

generated naturally by variations on environmental conditions, such as salinity, 

temperature and water chemistry. These variations in the environmental conditions 

the larvae faces are naturally “engraved” in its calcifying tissues in the form of differing 

isotopic signatures, structural attributes and trace elements (Leis, 2006; Thorrold et al., 

2007). This way, as larvae travel through different kinds of waters, each with its 

particular profile of chemical and physical attributes, their travels are “recorded” in the 

calcifying structures (Thorrold et al., 2007). Therefore, one can deduce where the 

larvae originated from, or where it has passed, from the multi-elemental signatures 

induced by a certain quality of water. However, in order to correctly deduce the 

larvae’s origin or route, one must have knowledge and sampling of many elemental 

signatures, and their respective sources, and establish that these signatures are stable 

over time (Thorrold et al., 2002; 2007; Levin, 2006). 

Methodologies for assessing larval dispersal based on genetic markers have many 

different approaches. They can use the genetic variability present in natural 

populations, paternal genetic analysis, natural spawning variation, or even use 

individuals that have been genetically modified in laboratory (Thorrold et al., 2002; 

Jones et al., 2009). However, these tagging methodologies present many 

disadvantages when compared with other marking methods. Besides being more 

costly to analyze and to apply, the information resulting from these methodologies is 

not easy to interpret and often is unpredictable (Thorrold et al., 2002). 

The marking of the calcifying structures of larvae (otoliths, statoliths, shells) using 

chemical artificial markers is a methodology which has been frequently used in larval 

dispersal studies (Beltran et al., 1995; Jones et al., 1999; 2005; Almany et al., 2007). 

These marks can be produced by immersion in a solution containing the chemical 

marker, or through supply of food marked with the chemical compound (Thorrold et 

al., 2007). The markers more frequently used in this methodology are fluorescent 

compounds, such as tetracycline or oxytetracycline, calcein (Levin, 2006; Thorrold et 

al., 2007), radioactive isotopes, such as 
137

Ba (Almany et al., 2007; Roy, 2008), 

elemental markers (rare earth elements), or physical marks made through extreme 

environmental changes, such as thermal signals (Thorrold et al., 2002). 



5 
 

Rare elemental markers use natural elements that are usually found or present in very 

low concentrations in the natural environment and in the larval’s tissues (Thorrold et 

al., 2002). This method allows for an easy identification of the marked individuals, as 

well as a good application of the marking to a large number of individuals. However, 

most of the times the elemental tag does not get absorbed or does not have a 

retention time long enough for it to serve as a marker, making this tagging technique 

highly unreliable. Besides these disadvantages, the costs associated with preparation 

and analysis of the samples is very high when compared to other methodologies with a 

higher level of successful markings (Thorrold et al., 2002). 

Thermal markings are usually applied to analyze hatchery grown fish, but it is being 

approached as a valid methodology to study marine organisms. This methodology 

exposes incubating larvae to extreme temperature fluctuations that result in 

distinctive structural banding in the otoliths (Volk et al., 1999). This methodology 

presents practically no costs at all for the preparation, and analysis has a cost similar to 

other methods using artificial marking and recapture of juveniles (Volk et al., 1999). 

Similarly to the other artificial marking methods, the radioactive isotope labeling 

methodology consists in an artificial marking of the larvae and posterior recapture, 

identification and accounting of tagged juveniles. In this methodology, gravid females 

are injected with trace amounts of rare, stable isotopes that are transferred to the 

offspring through the egg yolk (Thorrold et al., 2006; Almany et al., 2007; Roy, 2008). 

The retention time of most of these stable isotopes in the female’s body is long 

enough that, with a single injection, multiple batches of eggs are marked, producing a 

long-lasting mark in the center of the larvae’s otoliths. These marks can be identified 

through isotope ratios of the otoliths and are analyzed through Inductively Coupled 

Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Almany et al., 2007; Roy, 2008). Both Thorrold et 

al. (2006) and Roy (2008) studies did not detect any negative effects of the injection of 

low concentrations of stable isotopes on the reproduction rates of the females, or 

negative effects of the isotope labeling on the survival and development of the larvae. 

However, the materials needed for this methodology are very expensive and, adding 

to the laborious work of recollecting the otoliths from the recaptured juveniles, very 

specialized equipment and technicians are needed for the analysis of the isotopic 

ratios. 

Tagging with artificial fluorescent compounds is the most widely used of the artificial 

-

hn, 1992; Jones et al., 1999). The chemical compound tetracycline is a chemical 

artificial marker used to produce a fluorescent mark in the larvae’s otoliths. 

Tetracycline, as well as oxytetracycline, is an antibiotic and fluorescent compound that 

is integrated into the calcifying tissues of the fish, namely the otoliths. Its mark gets 

incorporated into the daily growth ring corresponding to the date of the tagging, being 



6 
 

visible under fluorescent light. In cases in which the tagging is done on fish embryos or 

larvae, the tagging is made through immersion of the individuals in a tetracycline 

containing solution during a preset period of time (Geffen, 1997). Tagging the larvae 

through tagged food is a problematic methodology since food intake may be irregular 

and livi - hn, 1992).  

Numerous authors have developed studies in which they use and/or analyze 

tetracycline tagging of larval calcifying structures by immersion in tetracycline 

solutions (Schmitt, 1984; Ts

- , 1992; Beltran et al. 1995; Jones et al., 1995; 

1999; 2005; Reinert et al., 1998; Champigneulle &amp;amp; Cachera, 2003; Kingsford et al., 

2010; Kohn &amp;amp; Clements, 2011). However, the methodology used for the immersion 

differs from study to study. In the vast majority, the tagging results from a long-term 

immersion in a low-concentration solution. The time of immersion vary from 1,5 to 24 

hours, and the concentration of the solutions spans from 350 mg.L
-1

 to 1000 mg.L
-1

 

(see Table 10) (Tsukamoto, 1985; Dabrowski &amp;amp; Tsukamoto, 1986; Reinert et al., 1998). 

There are also some works, that use shorter immersions of just a couple of minutes in 

a saline solution (to cause osmotic shock) with a high concentration of tetracycline 

(Alcobendas et al., 1991; 1992; Beltran et al., 1995; Champigneulle &amp;amp; Cachera, 2003), 

but these methodologies are usually employed in studies that focus in lacustrine 

species. 

The species on wich this study focuses were chosen as model species as their life 

cycles’, ecology and behaviour have been studied and described in detail before 

(Gonçalves et al., 1998; Hofrichter &amp;amp; Patzner, 2000; Faria &amp;amp; Gonçalves, 2010; Tojeira et 

al., 2011). Both are benthic spawners, and present parental care behaviours, with the 

male providing protection and aeration of the eggs though fanning and rubbing 

behaviours. They are easily captured during the low tides and maintained and 

reproduced in controlled conditions, and larvae can be reared up to settlement. 

Distributional (Borges et al., 2007) and behavioural (Faria &amp;amp; Gonçalves, 2010) studies 

suggest these species may be retained close to shore.  Taken together, these species 

are a promising model species to study larval dispersal and retention. 

Lepadogaster purpurea (Bonnaterre, 1788) and L. lepadogaster (Bonnaterre, 1788) are 

two abundant species of clingfish (Gobiesocidae family) with a very similar 

morphology. The similarity is such that until recently they were considered two 

subspecies of the same species (Lepadogaster lepadogaster purpurea and 

Lepadogaster lepadogaster lepadogaster) (Henriques et al., 2002). They have a 

distribution that ranges from the coast of Scotland to Senegal, the Canary and Madeira 

Islands and the Mediterranean (L. purpurea) and from the northern coast of Spain 

(Galicia) to northeast Africa, the Canary and Madeira Islands and the Mediterranean (L. 

lepadogaster) (Henriques et al., 2002).

Knowledge of Gobiesocidae ecology and behaviour is relatively poor, particularly due 

to their small size, which enables them to occupy very cryptic microhabitats (Gonçalves 

et al., 1998; Hofrichter &amp;amp; Patzner, 2000). Both species are common in rocky shores and 

banks of large pebbles and boulder fields, being found underneath rocks. They adhere 

to the rocky substractum by means of a sucking disc, which gives an extra adaptation 

to small habitats and also allows them to resist to the high water currents typical of 

the sublitoral (Hofrichter &amp;amp; Patzner, 2000). Some species of Gobiesocidae are 

considered “amphibious fish”, being adapted to living conditions in a strongly exposed 

habitat, such as the upper sublitoral that gets exposed each low-tide period (Hofrichter 

&amp;amp; Patzner, 2000). 

Although morphologically similar, these two species differ in their breeding season - L. 

purpurea’s breeding season occurs mainly during the winter months until the 

beginning of spring, while L. lepadogaster’s breeding season is during the spring, till 

the beginning of summer (Henriques et al., 2002).The main goal of this work was to 

validate the procedure for tetracycline tagging of the otoliths of embryos of these two 

gobiesocids. In particular, the minimum tetracycline concentration required to ensure 

the marking of the embryo’s otoliths was determined and the possible effect the 

different tetracycline concentrations have on the larvae’s survival was tested.

Materials and Methods 

1) Collection and handling of breeding adults and eggs  

Lepadogaster purpurea egg 

batches and adults were 

collected, during the low tide, 

between January and March 

2012, and Lepadogaster 

lepadogaster eggs and adults 

were captured between March 

and June 2012 at Alpertuche 

beach (38°28’ N; 8°59’ W) 

located at the Luiz Saldanha 

Arrábida Marine Park (Fig.1). The 

egg batches and adults were 

relocated and maintained in the 

facilities located in ISPA-IU 

(Instituto Superior de Psicologia 

Aplicada- Instituto Universitário), 

Lisbon. After the laboratory work 

was concluded, all the surviving 

adults and juveniles were 

released in the same area. 

Egg batches, larvae and adults were kept at an average temperature between 14-16°C 

during the Winter months, and 15-17°C during the Spring and Summer months, with a 

photoperiod of 14L:10D. Adults were kept in larger aquariums, with a substratum 

composed of rocks gathered in Alpertuche beach, some opaque PVC tubes and roof 

tiles. This substratum mainly served as shelter and breeding sites for the adults. They 

were daily fed a mix of shrimps, clams and mussels. As hatching approached, rocks 

with eggs were removed from the parental aquaria and transferred to 30 l larval 

rearing tank.  

2) Experimental design and tetracycline marking 

Eggs were immersed in the tetracycline solutions, for 30 minutes, as soon as they 

reached the pigmented-eye stage, when the otoliths begin formation (Beltran, et al., 

1995; Tojeira, et al., 2011). This time period was chosen as this is usually the time 

available between tides, and this methodology is meant to be used directly in the field 

during the low-tide period. 

Fig. 1: Sampling site location, on the Portuguese West Coast 

 



10 
 

For L. purpurea egg batches, solutions with the following tetracycline concentrations 

were used: 400 mg.L
-1

; 600 mg.L
-1

; 800 mg.L
-1

; 1000 mg.L
-1

 and 1400 mg.L
-1 

(Table 1). In 

addition, and for validation purposes, newly-hatched larvae were immersed for longer 

periods of time (1, 2 and 15 hours) in 1000 mg.L
-1 

solutions. These batches worked as a 

positive control, and were used to ascertain the appearance of the fluorescent 

tetracycline mark. For L. lepadogaster egg batches, the following three tetracycline 

concentrations were used: 600 mg.L
-1

, 800 mg.L
-1

 and 1000 mg.L
-1

 (Table 1).  

Six egg batches from L. purpurea and 5 egg batches from L. lepadogaster were 

assigned to a control group, being immersed in “clean” water for the same 30 minute 

period.  

Table 1: Number of replicates (egg batches) for each treatment for Lepadogaster purpurea and L. lepadogaster. 

 

 

3) Larval rearing and sampling 

After immersion, eggs were placed back to the rearing aquaria, where larvae 

hatched.   Aquaria were maintained at 14-15 ºC for Lepadogaster purpurea and 16-

17 ºC for L. lepadogaster, which was consistent with the mean water temperature 

at the sampling area in the testing dates (Henriques et al. 2002). All tanks were 

maintained at a salinity of 34-35 PSU, with a photoperiod of 14L:10D. Larvae’s diary 

diet was composed of Artemia salina and rotifers (supplied by Aquário Vasco da 

Gama), and fed ad libitum. L. purpurea could not be reared until settlement, unlike 

L. lepadogaster, which was successfully reared until the end of its pelagic phase. 

Larvae were sacrificed in different developmental stages, and preserved in 96% 

alcohol.  

To examine the effects of the different tetracycline concentrations on mortality 

rates,   the number of live larvae was daily counted in each tank. Mortality rates 

were determined for two different development periods: 

a) 5 days after hatching; 

b) 10 days after hatching.

These time limits were chosen as they represent critical steps in larval 

development: mortality is higher in the first 5 days (A. Faria personal observation), 

after which it starts to decrease; and larvae of L. lepadogaster start spending more 

time close to the bottom around 10 days after hatching (A. Faria personal 

observation).  

 

4)  Otolith extraction, preparation and analysis 

Otoliths were removed and mounted in preheated microscope slides using 

CRYSTAL BOND™. Samples were kept in opaque boxes, in order to avert 

tetracycline degradation due to sunlight exposure. Otoliths were observed under a 

fluorescence microscope Olympus BX-50. Two different fluorescence filters were 

used, so that the presence or absence of fluorescence from tetracycline could be 

more accurately determined. Tetracycline has an excitation peak at 390 nm and an 

emission peak at 560 nm (Skinner &amp;amp; Nalbandian, 1975; Pautke, et al., 2010). The 

filters used had and excitement specter from 450 to 480 nm and an emission 

specter starting at 515 nm (Olympus U-MWB (WB)), and an excitement specter 

from 330 to 385 nm and an emission specter between 420 and 700 nm (Olympus 

U-MWU (WU)). After observation of the positive control otoliths (from larvae 

immersed in 1000 mg. L
-1

 tetracycline solution for 1, 2 and 15 hours), a 

characterization of the different ranks that would later on be used to categorize 

the other otoliths was made. This characterization would analyze the thickness and 

shape of the fluorescent marking and the contrast between the otolith and the 

surrounding medium. The measuring of the fluorescent marking was made using 

AxioVision V. 4.8.2.0. software. 

Samples were classified in three categories, according to the visibility of the 

tetracycline marks: Clear marking (1); Not clear/ With Autofluorescence (1/0); No 

Fluorescence (0). The treatment with the biggest proportion of samples classified 

as 1, would be considered the most successful one. This analysis methodology is 

similar to the one used by Tsukamoto (1985) and by Dabrowski &amp;amp; Tsukamoto 

(1986). 

5) Data analysis 

The mortality rates were calculated from the percentage of total dead larvae from 

each day, for each replicate. When all the percentages were collected from each 

replicate, and these values used for statistical analysis. 

In order to verify the existence of statistically significant relations between 

treatments applied to larvae and the tetracycline markings and the mortality rates, 

a variance analysis of the results was made. The assumptions for the ANOVA were 

verified for every set of data, having used the Shapiro-Wilk’s test to verify 



12 
 

normalcy, and the Lavene test for homocedasticity. When these prerequisites were 

not fulfilled, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was applied. When the 

requisites were fulfilled, a one-way ANOVA was used.  

All statistical analysis were made using StatSoft Inc. (2011) STATISTICA  software 

(version 10).

 Results 

1. Tetracycline marking  

Testing began with immersion of L. purpurea larvae in low-concentration solutions 

(400, 600 and 800 mg.L
-1

). After viewing these samples in the fluorescence microscope 

and assessing that no markings or fluorescence were visible, immersions were made 

using higher-concentrated solutions (1000 and 1400 mg.L
-1

). The samples resulting 

from these immersions exhibited fluorescence, but no defined and clear tetracycline 

marking. 

With these results in mind, when immersions of L. lepadogaster larvae began, high-

concentrated tetracycline solutions were used from the start (800 and 1000 mg.L
-1

). A 

lower- concentrated solution was also used (600 mg.L
-1

) after viewing fluorescence in 

samples resulting from the 800 mg.L
-1

 immersions.    

1.1. Positive control otoliths 

For the validation of the marking technique, newly-hatched L. purpurea larvae were 

immersed in a 1000 mg.L
-1

 tetracycline solution for 1, 2 and 15 hours.  

When observing otoliths from these treatments, a vast difference in fluorescence and 

marking quality was observed between the samples that came from the 1 and 2 hours 

immersion and the samples that came from the 15 hours one. The samples from the 

15 hour immersion-period (N=2) displayed a much better and distinct tetracycline 

marking (Fig. 2).  These samples were then used for validation purposes, by comparing 

the obtained fluorescence mark to the mark produced by the treatments being 

investigated.  

In these samples, the tetracycline marking in the otoliths presented a minimum 

thickness of 2.0 µm. This kind of sample is an example of an otolith with a clear 

tetracycline fluorescent mark, and would be classified as 1 (“Clear Marking”) in the 

Marking Efficiency Analysis (see Methods). In this sense, in order to an otolith to be 

ranked as 1 (“Clear Marking”), its fluorescent mark must have a thickness of at least 

2.0 µm. In order to determine if with a lower-concentration solution the tetracycline 

marking would be thinner, the markings present on the otoliths from the 2-hour 

immersion treatment (N=2) were also measured. Similarly to the other validation 

otoliths, the tetracycline markings found in the 2-hour immersion otoliths had a 

thickness bigger than 2 µm, not differing much from the measurements taken from the 

15-hour immersion otoliths.

Fig. 2: Photographs of an otolith removed from a 4 days-old L. purpurea larva that had been immersed in a 1000 

mg.L
-1

 solution for 15 hours. The larva was immersed right after hatching, and sacrificed 4 days after hatching. The 

arrows indicate the tetracycline mark. The same otoliths were seen under fluorescent light using two different 

filters. A: WB (excitement specter from 450 to 480 nm and an emission specter starting at 515 nm); B: WU 

(excitement specter from 330 to 385 nm and an emission specter between 420 and 700 nm). 

From these results, the characterization of the different ranks was as follows: 

 Rank 1: “Clear Marking”: 

o When observed under fluorescent light, the otolith shows a clear and 

discernible tetracycline marking in the form of a bright ring; 

o The marking must completely surround the otolith (whole ring); 

o It has to have a good contrast with the surrounding medium; 

o The tetracycline marking has to have at least 2.0 µm thickness. 

 Rank 1/0: “No Clear Marking” or “With Autofluorescence”: 

o When observed under fluorescent light the otolith shows fluorescence, 

even in the control treatment; 

o Does not show a visible and discernible tetracycline mark (&amp;lt;2.0 µm). 

 Rank 0: “No Fluorescence”: 

o When observed under fluorescent light, the otolith is not visible. 

 

1.2. Treatment otoliths 

A comparison of all otoliths was made through visual inspection of otoliths. In addition, 

a measurement of the thickness of tetracycline mark was made. For this visual 

analysis, the photographs used were the ones taken under fluorescent light using the 

Olympus U-MWU (WU) filter, as the tetracycline marks are more visible with this filter 

compared to the photographs taken using the Olympus U-MWB (WB) filter (Fig. 2). 

The positive control treatment enabled the visual comparison of L. purpurea otoliths 

exposed to the same tetracycline concentration (1000 mg.L
-1

), but increasing 

immersion times (30 minutes, 1, 2 and 15 hours). Otoliths from the 30 minute 

A B 



15 
 

immersion period (N=11) did not all display fluorescence; the ones that had 

fluorescence were blurry and did not present a distinct tetracycline mark. Nonetheless, 

there were some tetracycline marks, but none of them had a thickness larger than 2.0 

µm (biggest had 1.31 µm). 

The otoliths from the 1 hour immersion period (N=7) all presented strong 

fluorescence. However, none of them had a clear, distinct tetracycline mark.  

The otoliths from the 2 hours immersion period presented a strong fluorescence and a 

good contrast with the background of the sample. The tetracycline mark is visible, but 

the autofluorescence is still present. In all samples the tetracycline fluorescent 

marking’s thickness is bigger than 2 µm (2.07 and 2.74 µm). 

 

Fig. 3: Photographs of otoliths from L. purpurea larvae, using a fluorescence microscope with the WU filter. All 

larvae were immersed in a tetracycline solution of 1000 mg.L
-1

 for different periods of time: A- immersion of 30 

minutes (7 days-old larva); B- immersion of 1 hour (7 days-old larva); C- immersion of 2 hours (4 days-old larva); D- 

immersion of 15 hours (4 days-old larva). 

Regarding the otoliths from the different concentration treatments (30 minutes 

immersion period), there was not a clear distinction between otoliths from control 

groups and otoliths from treatment groups. In addition, some control otoliths 

appeared to have a tetracycline mark (Fig. 4), but none of the so-called tetracycline 

markings had the necessary thickness in order to be considered a true fluorescent 

marking (0.76 µm for otolith C and 0.46 µm for otolith D).

Fig. 4: Photographs of otoliths from L. purpurea larvae, using a fluorescence microscope with the WU filter. All 

otoliths come from control group larvae, i.e. larvae that did not suffer immersion in a tetracycline solution. Otoliths 

A and B are examples of how the vast majority of control samples look like. Otoliths C and D appear to have a 

tetracycline marking around the edge of the otolith. Otoliths were extracted from larvae with the following ages: A- 

5 days; B- 7 days; C- 5 days; D- 1 days. 

Despite this, an increase in autofluorescence with increasing concentration of 

tetracycline solution in which the larvae were immersed was observed (Fig. 5). Only 

the samples that came from treatment group with a T400 mg.L
-1

 did not display any 

signs of fluorescence. However, no sample showed signs of a distinct tetracycline 

marking and many preparations did not show a satisfactory contrast with the 

background.  

 

Fig. 5: Photographs of otoliths from L. purpurea larvae, using a fluorescence microscope with the WU filter. All 

larvae were immersed in tetracycline solutions of different concentrations, for a time period of 30 minutes. The 

different concentrations were: A- 600 mg.L
-1

; B- 800 mg.L
-1

; C- 1000 mg.L
-1

; D-1400 mg.L
-1

. Otoliths were extracted 

from larvae with the following ages: A- 0 days; B- 0 days; C- 7 days; D- 11 days. 

Similarly to what was verified for L. purpurea, there was a lot of autofluorescence in all 

samples of L. lepadogaster, regardless of the provenience of the otolith (treatment or 

control) (Figs 6 and 7). There were cases in which some marks were observed, but 

none had the minimum thickness (2 µm) to be ranked as a “true” tetracycline mark.  

However, as the solution’s concentration increased, so did the intensity of the otoliths 

fluorescence. This increase in brightness translated in an increase of contrast between 

the sample’s otoliths (see Fig. 7).

otoliths come from control group larvae, i.e. larvae that did not suffer immersion in a tetracycline solution. Otoliths 

A and B are examples of how the vast majority of control samples look like. Otoliths C and D appear to have a 

tetracycline marking around the edge of the otolith. Otoliths were extracted from larvae with the following ages: A- 

0 days; B- 0 days; C- 20 days; D- 12 days. 

 

 

Fig. 7: Photographs of otoliths from L. lepadogaster larvae, taken using a fluorescence microscope with the WU 

filter. Otolith A came from a control group larva, and otoliths B through D came from larvae that were immersed in 

tetracycline solutions of different concentrations, for a time period of 30 minutes. The different concentrations 

were: B- 600 mg.L
-1

; C- 800 mg.L
-1

; D- 1000 mg.L
-1

. Otoliths were extracted from larvae with the following ages: A- 0 

days; B- 0 days; C- 7 days; D- 8 days. 

Figure 8 shows, in more detail, the comparison of a control otolith (A) and a treatment 

otolith, immersed for 30 minutes in a tetracycline solution of 600 mg.L
-1

 (B). As it can 

be seen, there is very little difference between the two otoliths.

Otoliths marked with A came from a larvae belonging to a control group, and the otolith marked with B came from a 

larvae that had been immersed in a 600 mg.L
-1

 tetracycline solution. 

1.3. Classification of samples 

There were no L. purpurea otoliths showing a clear and obvious tetracycline mark 

(Table 2). There is a very high percentage of otoliths classified as 1/0 (“No Clear 

Marking” or “With Autofluorescence”), being the control, T1000 mg.L
-1

 and T1400 

mg.L
-1

 groups the one with the higher percentages (75, 100 and 86,36%, respectively). 

The only group that showed no fluorescence whatsoever was the T400 mg.L
-1

 

treatment group, with 0 otoliths ranked as 1/0 or 1.

In order to ascertain if a statistically significant relation between the different 

thickness measures and the treatments a statistical analysis of variance was made. 

Seeing as these data do not have the necessary homocedasticity to apply a one-way 

ANOVA, a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was applied. This test produced a p value 

of 0.2326. Being large that 0.05, this means the H0 is accepted, and that no significant 

differences between the variances were detected.  

Similarly to the pattern observed for L. purpurea, there were no L. lepadogaster 

otoliths classified as having a clear and distinct fluorescent tetracycline marking (Table 

4). The percentages of otoliths ranked as 0 and 1/0 in the control group are very 

similar to the ones observed in L. purpurea. The same applies to the other treatment, 

except for the T600 mg.L
-1

 group. While in L. purpurea the higher percentage of 



20 
 

otoliths from T600 mg.L
-1

 larvae did not display any fluorescence (and hence were 

ranked as 0), in L. lepadogaster most of the otoliths showed fluorescence, albeit not a 

true tetracycline marking.  

Table 4: Result, in percentages, of classification of L. lepadogaster otoliths, where 0 is classified as “No 

fluorescence”; 1/0 as “No clear marking” or “With Autofluorescence”; and 1 as “Clear marking”.

As for L. lepadogaster, there were some otoliths classified as 1/0 (“No clear Marking” 

or “With Autofluorescence”) that exhibited a possible tetracycline marking. The 

thicknesses of these markings and their respective groups are presented in Table 5.

As these data fulfilled the necessary normality and homocedasticity assumptions, a 

one-way ANOVA variance analysis was performed. This analysis concluded that no 

statistically significant relation between the several treatment and control groups and 

the thickness of possible tetracycline fluorescent markings was present (F=2.8; 

p&gt;0,05). 

 

2. Mortality rates 

The effects of tetracycline concentration on the larvae’s survival rates in the first 5 

days after hatching are shown in Fig. 9,  

 



21 
 

 

Fig. 9: Mortality rates up to 5 days post-hatching for Lepadogaster lepadogaster and Lepadogaster purpurea for each treatment. 

 

There were no statistically significant effects of tetracycline tagging on the survival 

rates of L. purpurea (F=0.86; p&gt;0.05) and L. lepadogaster (F=1.34; p&gt;0.05) larvae up to 

5 days post-hatching.  

It was not possible to determine mortality rates up to 10 days post-hatching for L. 

purpurea since out of the 25 different treatment groups, only 5 of them had larvae 

that survived till that age. On the other hand, L. lepadogaster had 10 out of 16 

different groups with larvae that survived, at least, until 10 days post-hatching. 

Therefore, it was only possible to determine and analyze mortality rates up until 10 

days post-hatching for L. lepadogaster.

Results show that there were no statistically significant effects of the tetracycline 

tagging on mortality rates of L. lepadogaster larvae up to 10 days post-hatching 

(F=0.25; p&gt;0,05).

Discussion 

In the vast majority of studies using tetracycline tagging, the mark has been described 

as a fluorescent ring present in the daily increment correspondent to the day the 

tagging occurred (Schmitt, 1984; Tsukamoto, 1984; Dabrowski &amp;amp; Tsukamoto, 1986). 

However, the markings observed from this work’s samples did not match the 

descriptions. Most observed otoliths presented a homogeneous fluorescence spread 

throughout the whole otolith, without any conspicuous fluorescent rings. Many 

otoliths presented the core as being a little brighter than the rest of the structure; in 

some of them, the fluorescence was blurry; and in others the otolith structure 

appeared vividly. There have been many studies of validation or daily increment 

deposit rates on the otolith that use a tetracycline fluorescent marking in the otolith as 

reference. In this case, all resulting fluorescence marks were so blurry and indistinct, 

the number of daily increments occupied by the tetracycline marking was not possible 

to validate. 

In tetracycline tagging studies, observations of autofluorescence of otoliths are 

frequent (Schmitt, 1984; Tsukamoto, 1985). These studies described the 

autofluorescence as a faint fluorescence around the edges and occasionally along 

cracks and the surface of the otolith. In this work, autofluorescence was observed, but 

in a much more obvious mode. Most otoliths (12 for L. purpurea and 26 for L. 

lepadogaster) that were extracted from control group larvae (without treatment) 

showed, unexpectedly, clear fluorescence. In most of these cases, the fluorescence 

observed in control otoliths was stronger and more noticeable than fluorescence in 

treatment otoliths (Figs. 4 and 6). This autofluorescence in control group otoliths 

could, in fact, be mistaken for a true tetracycline marking. Therefore, it was concluded 

that autofluorescence was present in most otoliths, independently of the treatment.   

Neither of the 30-minutes immersion treatments yielded positive results, i.e. no 

otoliths displayed a clear and distinct tetracycline fluorescent marking. However, there 

is a very high percentage of otoliths classified as 1/0 (“No Clear Marking” 

or”Autofluorescence”), which could either mean autofluorescence or a weak and 

indistinct tetracycline marking. Statistical analysis of the otoliths that had a possible, 

but not clear tetracycline marking confirms that there were no significant relations 

between the thicknesses found in these indistinct marks and the treatment groups 

they belonged to (see Table 6). This facts, adding to the high number of false positives 

found in the control groups (see Tables 3 and 4) indicates that 30-minutes immersions, 

independently of the concentration of the tetracycline solutions, do not produce 

reliable markings.  

When comparing control group otoliths and treatment group otoliths, most of the 

times they are indistinguishable from one another due to strong presence of 



24 
 

autofluorescence in the untreated otoliths. This would result in an inability to indentify 

the marked recruits from the unmarked ones, at the time of recapture and 

quantification, leading to extremely erroneous estimations of the self recruitment of 

the target population.   

When comparing the visual aspect of otoliths from larvae that were immersed in a 

1000 mg.L
-1

 tetracycline solution for different periods of time (1, 2 and 15 hours), an 

increase in the quality of the fluorescent marking and in the contrast between the 

otolith and the surrounding medium could be verified. Through this visual analysis, it 

was possible to see that, up to 2 hours of immersion in a 1000 mg.L
-1

 tetracycline 

solution, otolith tagging is extremely difficult. However, as the immersion time 

increased from 2 to 15 hours, the quality and intensity of the fluorescence of the 

tetracycline marking increased, reaching a fluorescent intensity that even masked the 

autofluorescence, translating in a better contrast between the otolith and the 

background (see Fig. 3). This comparison of effectiveness between longer and shorter 

periods of immersion was not accomplished for L. lepadogaster, and therefore a 

positive control treatment for this species is lacking. Taken together, these results 

suggest that the key-factor in a successful tagging of fish larvae’s otoliths is not only 

the concentration of the tetracycline solution, but mainly the immersion time. In most 

of the studies that make use of tetracycline tagging of larvae’s otoliths, the immersion 

time is never inferior to a 1,5 -hour period (see table 10).

respective studies. All studies targeted marine fish species.

As can be seen in Table 10, most of the authors use a longer immersion period and 

solutions with lower concentrations than the one used in this study. Tsukamoto 

(1985), for example, tested a vast array of immersion times and different concentrated 

solutions. The shorter immersion, of 1,5-hour,  did not yield any positive markings, 

having his results pointed that, for egg marking, the tetracycline tagging starts to be 

effective only from a 6-hour immersion in a 300 mg.L
-1

 solution. Jones et al. (2005), on 

the other hand, use a fairly short-time immersion with a low-concentrated solution 



25 
 

(2h, 250 mg.L
-1

). These apparently contradictory results may be attributed to 

differences in seawater temperature in which the immersion was made. Dabrowski &amp;amp; 

Tsukamoto (1985) study the possible effects that temperature may have in the 

incorporation of the tetracycline mark. They concluded that lower temperatures result 

in a much thinner tetracycline marking, suggesting that this may be related to the 

different metabolism and growth rates that larvae have at different temperatures. 

Being so, this difference in immersion times and concentration may come from the 

fact that while Tsukamoto (1985) worked with ayu fish (Plecoglossus altivelis) using 

water at 20°C, Jones et al. (2005) worked with the tropical panda clownfish 

(Amphiprion polymnus) in Papua New Guinea where sea surface temperature goes 

from 24 to 31°C. Vigliola (1997) also considers the possibility that salinity might affect 

tetracycline incorporation as well. He states that one hypothesis for the difference 

verified in the successfulness of this marking method between freshwater and marine 

fish was the chelating reaction that tetracycline has with the divalent cations of 

seawater. However, when the marking immersion was tried using a NaCl solution 

instead of seawater

-

-

(1992). In their work, they successfully tagged coregonid larvae’s otoliths with an 

immersion time of only one hour. However, they came to the conclusion that, in order 

to have a clear marking, the minimum concentration needed was 1000 mg.L
-1

.  

So it seems that, in order to have successful markings, one needs to have several 

variables in mind, such as the nature of the species (marine vs lacustrine) and water 

temperature. Finally, the necessary concentration of the tetracycline solution will 

highly depend of the immersion times that will be applied.  

One of the goals of this study was to assess the successfulness and reliability of this 

methodology to tag otoliths of gobiesocidae larvae using an immersion time of only 30 

minutes. This immersion time limit was established in order to proceed with the 

tetracycline marking of egg batches directly in the field during the low-tide period. 

According to the results, an immersion of at least 2 hours is necessary in order to 

produce a clear and distinct tetracycline marking in the larvae’s otoliths. Being so, it 

can be concluded that this tagging methodology is not the best suited for this study’s 

needs. However, seeing as the 2-hour immersion produces good and clear tetracycline 

fluorescent markings, an alteration in the methodology is possible. Instead of 

proceeding with the immersions only during the low-tide period, a two-hour 

immersion in tetracycline would be made, and the egg batches would be returned to 

their original location through scuba-diving. It’s not as practical as the orginal 

methodology, but it’s a good alternative. 



26 
 

Despite the unsuccessful tagging, the immersion of larvae in tetracycline solutions did 

not exhibit any significant effects on survival rates of both species in the first 5 days 

post-hatching (Fig. 9), as well as close to settlement in Lepadogaster lepadogaster. 

These results are in accordance to other studies, such as Tsukamoto (1985) and 

Dabrowski &amp;amp; Tsukamoto (1986). These authors concluded that not only the tagging 

does not affect the larvae’s development and survival rates, but the tetracycline may 

in fact aid in the larvae’s survival through its antibiotic properties (Dabrowski &amp;amp; 

Tsukamoto, 1986; Beltran et al., 1995). Rearing of L. purpurea was not as successful as 

L. lepadogaster and estimates of mortality rates close so settlement were not possible. 

Rearing fish larvae in laboratory conditions is extremely difficult, and time consuming. 

Fish larvae are very sensitive, they die very easily (Holt &amp;amp; Riley, 1999- unpublished 

data), and it’s not always an easy task to find the best conditions for maintenance in 

artificial environments. The longer pelagic larval duration of L. purpurea in contrast to 

L. lepadogaster (Tojeira et al. 2012) may explain the unsuccessful rearing of the former 

species, but also, there were some logistic problems in the laboratory’s aquarium 

system that caused a very high mortality of L. purpurea larvae, drastically decreasing 

the available N for this species. In addition, these species produce a low number of 

eggs, and therefore the number of larvae at hatching was never high.  

Although this methodology revealed itself to be unsuitable to the needs of this study, 

other tagging techniques may prove more adequate. One of these methodologies is 

tagging via radioactive stable isotopes, such as 
137

Ba (Thorrold, 2006; Almany et al., 

2007; Roy, 2008). The mark is deposited in the larvae’s otoliths and, when applied in 

the correct dosages, this procedure has little to no effect on development and survival 

of the tagged subjects, nor on the reproduction of the injected females (Thorrold et al., 

2006; Roy, 2008). However, it does present numerous advantages and disadvantages 

when compared with the tetracycline tagging method. The main disadvantage is the 

cost. The materials used in tagging are much more expensive and the equipment 

necessary to proceed with the observations require a much more specialized and 

technical approach. However, with this tagging technique a single application of the 

radioactive tag has the potential to mark simultaneously numerous egg batches. Due 

to its high retention time in the gravid female’s organism, a single injection has the 

potential to mark every single egg that female will produce in that reproductive period, 

making this method much easier to apply to a larger number of larvae. Not only this, 

but receiving this mark via maternal transmission means that the individual will remain 

tagged for the rest of its life (Thorrold, 2006), eliminating the retention time dilemma., 

The tagging through radioactive stable isotopes technique is a very good and reliable 

marking method for large number of larvae and, seeing as the only procedure 

necessary for the marking is an injection, seems adequate for in situ application on the 

gravid females. However, notwithstanding the unsuccessfulness of this tetracycline 

tagging methodology, in order to execute a survey of larval dispersal of a marine fish 

species, several estimates are necessary, and most of the times they are extremely 



27 
 

difficult to obtain. First, an extrapolation of the percentage of total spawned larvae 

from the target population that were actually marked is necessary. This would involve 

a survey of the number of egg batches produced by the target population, and of the 

mean number of eggs in each batch, plus a later estimate of natural mortality rates 

suffered by the young larvae. Secondly, it would be necessary to recapture as many 

recruits as possible, and estimate the percentage of the total population of recruits 

that were captured. And then, using these population extrapolations and counting how 

many of the recaptured recruits bear the chemical marking, an estimate of self 

recruitment of the target population can be ascertained. As can be deduced, these 

extrapolations and estimates are extremely difficult to make, and can be even 

impossible if the target population has a widespread residential area, or a high rate of 

larval dispersal. For example, Jones (2005) made a successful estimate of self 

recruitment of a population, but the target species was a fish species whose habitat 

comes down to a single anemone. Due to this extremely limited habitat, it became 

easier to proceed with tagging and recapturing that enveloped practically the entire 

population.  In the case of L. purpurea and L. lepadogaster, their habitat in Luiz 

Saldanha Arrábida Marine Park is relatively limited, seeing as both species’ 

distributions in that area are practically limited to Alpertuche beach. With this limited 

habitat and the fact that these species’ larvae have a morphology and ontogeny that 

suggest a mainly benthic development, indicating a high probability of retention in 

their spawning location, make these species an ideal subject for this type of survey. 

In conclusion, the methodology for tagging larvae otoliths with the chemical 

compound tetracycline using an immersion time of only 30 minutes revealed itself 

unsuccessful and unreliable. In order to effectively tag the larvae, a longer period of 

exposure to the artificial tag was necessary. However, seeing as these species present 

ideal characteristics for a larval dispersal study, an opportunity to further develop 

knowledge on temperate reef fish ecology should not go to waste. Although longer 

immersion periods are not possible in field tagging, the testing and study of another 

tagging technique, such as stable isotope labeling, is needed.
