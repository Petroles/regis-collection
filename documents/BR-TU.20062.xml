ABSTRACT: The Dom Feliciano Belt is an important Neoprotero-
zoic to Cambrian orogenic complex, extending from eastern Uruguay 
to southern Brazil. It comprises a collage of oceanic domains and 
continental fragments developed between 900 and 540 Ma between 
the Rio de La Plata, Congo and Kalahari cratons. The integration of 
field and structural data with recent isotopic results has introduced 
new insights on the sources of the magmatism and sedimentary 
processes. This paper presents a review of the geochronological re-
sults combined with stratigraphic, structural and geochemical data. 
The  evolution of the Dom Feliciano Belt involved three orogenic 
events known as the Passinho (0.89 – 0.86 Ga), São Gabriel (0.77 – 
0.68 Ga) and Dom Feliciano (0.65 – 0.54 Ga). The first two events 
involved the closure of the Charrua Ocean generating an intra-oce-
anic arc (Passinho) and, subsequently, an active continental margin 
arc (São Gabriel). This ocean separated the continental areas repre-
sented by the Rio de la Plata Craton and the Nico Perez continental 
microplate. Closure of the Adamastor ocean resulted in an important 
collisional event between the Nico Perez Microplate/Rio de La Plata 
Craton and Kalahari and Congo cratons between 650 and 620 Ma, 
involving high T/intermediate P metamorphism. At  this time of 
crustal thickening, the partition of the deformation controled the fi-
nal evolution of the belt with important escape tectonics, responsible 
for nucleating crustal-scale transcurrent shear zones. These structures 
were deep and promoted the rise of mafic magmas, which, associated 
with high regional thermal gradient, lead to an important event of 
crustal reworking, responsible for the formation of the Pelotas Batho-
lith. The orogenic collapse is represented by late magmatism of Pelo-
tas Batholith and deposition of upper section of the Camaquã Basin.

RESUMO: O Cinturão Dom Feliciano, que se estende desde o leste 
do Uruguai até o sul do Brasil, representa um importante orógeno Neo-
proterozoico formado pela colagem de domínios oceânicos e fragmentos 
continentais entre os crátons Rio de La Plata, Congo e Kalahari. A in-
tegração de dados de mapeamento geológico e estrutural com resultados 
isotópicos permitu estabelecer uma melhor compreensão sobre as fontes 
de magmatismo e os processos de sedimentação. A evolução do Cinturão 
Dom Feliciano envolveu a superposição de três eventos orogênicos deno-
minados Passinho (0.89 – 0.86 Ga), São Gabriel (0.77 – 0.68 Ga) e 
Dom Feliciano (0.65 – 0.54 Ga). Os dois primeiros eventos envolvem 
o fechamento do oceano Charrua com a geração inicial de um arco 
intra-oceânico (Passinho) e, posteriormente, de um arco continental 
(São Gabriel). Esse oceano separava as áreas continentais representadas 
pelo cráton Rio de La Plata e a microplaca continental Nico Perez. 
No  terceiro evento ocorreu fechamento do oceano Adamastor em de-
corrência da colisão entre os crátons Rio de La Plata e Kalahari entre 
650  – 620  Ma, envolvendo condições metamórficas de alta tempera-
tura e pressão intermediária. Neste momento de grande espessamento 
crustal, a partição da deformação no cinturão controla a sua evolução 
final com a passagem para uma tectônica de escape, responsável pela 
nucleação de zonas de cisalhamento transcorrentes de escala crustal. 
Essas estruturas são profundas e promoveram a geração e a ascenção de 
magmas máficos, que, associados ao elevado gradiente térmico regional, 
induziram um extenso evento de retrabalhamento crustal, responsável 
pela formação do Batólito Pelotas. O colapso do orógeno é representado 
pelo magmatismo tardio do batólito e pela formação das sequências 
superiores da Bacia do Camaquã.

INTRODUCTION

The Mantiqueira orogenic system is of one of the main 
Neoproterozoic orogens formed during the assembly of 
West Gondwana. It comprises the Dom Feliciano (Uruguay 
and southern Brazil), Ribeira (Paraná, São Paulo, Minas 
Gerais and Rio de Janeiro states) and Araçuaí belts (Espírito 
Santo, eastern Minas Gerais and southern Bahia states) 
(e.g.: Heilbron &amp;amp; Machado 2003). Its African counterpart 
includes the Saldania-Gariep, Damara, Kaoko and West 
Congo belts (Fig. 1). Several models have been presented 
to explain the tectonic evolution of this orogen and its role 
in the assemby of West Gondwana (e.g.: Chemale 2000, 
Cordani et al. 2003, Basei et al. 2008). The Mantiqueira 
Province is a NE-SW mobile belt running parallel to the 
southern and eastern coast of Brazil extending for more than 
3,000 km from Bahia to Uruguay. 

The Dom Feliciano Belt (DFB) formed during a long-
lived evolution of ca. 450 My, starting with the opening of the 
Charrua Ocean in the southwestern portion of Gondwana, 
at 950 – 900 Ma. The closure of this ocean and the colli-
sion of magmatic arcs occured between 770 and 680 Ma. 
This was followed by the closure of the Adamastor Ocean 
and the collision between the Nico Perez Microplate/Rio de 
La Plata Craton and the Kalahari Craton at the end of the 
Neoproterozoic. Three distinct events may be recognized:
1. the development of the Passinho Arc,
2. the development of the São Gabriel Arc, and
3. the formation of the Dom Feliciano Arc (Chemale Jr. 

et al. 1995, Chemale Jr. 2000, Saalmann et al. 2010).

In this paper, we present a review of the data on the DFB 
geological evolution, in particular the new U-Pb geochronolog-
ical data on igneous and metamorphic rocks and sedimentary

Tectonic evolution of the Dom Feliciano Belt



provenance studies of the Precambrian terrains of the DFB, Nico 
Perez Microplate and Rio de La Plata Craton in RS. The pres-
ent compilation includes, therefore, a historical review, starting 
with the pioneer Rb-Sr studies (Silva Filho 1984, Soliani Jr. 
1986), and passing to the use of Pb-Pb and ID-TIMS U-Pb 
systematics (Machado et al. 1990, Babinski et al. 1996, 1997). 
More recently, the widespread use of the SHRIMP (Silva et al. 
1997, 2000; Leite et al. 1998, 2000; Hartmann et al. 1999, 
2000) and LA-ICP-MS techniques has produced abundant 
new isotopic data allowing significant progress to the under-
standing of tectonic processes in southern Brazil.

METHODS

This work is based mainly on a review of U-P and 
Pb-Pb zircon geochronology available for the Precambrian 

terrains in southern Brazil. To assess the sources of mag-
mas we used Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd and some Lu-Hf and ?18O 
data. The interpretation of geochronological and iso-
topic data was then combined with a review of field 
geological data produced by various regional geological 
mapping projects.

The magmatic crystallization ages are more abundant 
and were predominantly obtained by the Rb-Sr, U-Pb 
SHRIMP and LA-ICPMS methods. Metamoprhic ages 
were obtained by dating of zircon and titanite by U-Pb 
method, of whole rock and mineral by Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd and 
Ar-Ar isotope methods, and of monazite from metapelites 
by EMPA. The U-Pb zircon data also include provenance 
studies of metavolcano-sedimentary complexes, includ-
ing a total of 1,338 zircon grains analysed, of which 662 
remain unpublished. Data used in the present review are 
presented in Figure 2.

GEOTECTONIC CONTEXT

The southern Brazilian Shield comprises Paleo-, Meso- and 
Neoproterozoic tectono-stratigraphic units. The geology of this 
area consists of fragments of the Nico Perez Terrane (Oyhantçabal 
et al. 2011; Rapela et al. 2011) composed of Paleoproterozoic, 
Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic metamorphic and granitic 
rocks, surrounded by Neoproterozoic associations of the DFB (Fig. 1).

The DFB is the southern segment of the Mantiqueira 
Province, and represents a crustal segment strongly deformed 
and migmatized between ca. 650 and 620 Ma (eg.: Fernandes 
et al. 1992, Chemale et al. 1995, Basei et al. 2011, Bitencourt 
&amp;amp; Nardi 2000, Philipp &amp;amp; Machado 2005, Saalmann et al. 
2005, 2006, 2010, Philipp et al. 2013, 2016a, Hartmann 
et al. 1999, 2000, 2011, Chemale Jr. et al. 2012). Remnants 
of older continental crust are represented by septa exposed 
in Santa Catarina (Hartmann et al. 2000, Basei et al. 2008), 
Rio Grande do Sul (Philipp &amp;amp; Machado, 2005, Philipp 
et al. 2008, Hartmann et al. 2008, 2011), and Uruguay 
(Hartmann et al. 2002, Oyhantçabal et al. 2011). 

The DFB is divided from west to east in:
1. São Gabriel Terrane,
2. Tijucas Terrane,
3. Florianópolis-Pelotas-Aigua batholiths,

4. Rocha and Punta del Este terranes (Fig. 3).

The belt comprises rock units developed during three major 
orogenic events: the Passinho (890 – 860 Ma), São Gabriel 
(770 – 680 Ma) and the Dom Feliciano (650 – 540 Ma) (e.g.: 
Chemale Jr. 2000, Hartmann et al. 2007, Saalmann et al. 2010, 
Philipp et al. 2014). 

The relationships between the units of Rio de La Plata 
Craton (RLPC), Nico Perez Microplate (NPM) and Dom 
Feliciano Belt (DFB) are shown in Figure 2, in which a combi-
nation of information including the time relationships between 
lithostratigraphic and geotectonic units and time, U-Pb and 
Pb-Pb geochronology (crystallization, metamorphic ages and 
detrital zircon provenance in metasediments), geochemistry, 
and main orogenic cycles are presented. The geochronologi-
cal data indicate three main Neoproterozoic orogenic events:
1. initial crustal accretion phase with juvenile magmatism, 

between ca. 890 and 860,
2. continental arc magmatism and accretion between 770 

and 680 Ma, and
3. collisional metamorphism between 650 and 620 Ma and 

a main magmatic phase between ca. 650 and 550 Ma, 
with intense crustal anatexis promoted by the injection 
of mantle magmas.

Tectonic evolution of the Dom Feliciano Belt



In some areas a younger regional metamorphic event (570 – 
560 Ma) associated with transcurrent shear zones is recognized.

The fragments of the Nico Perez Terrane (Oyhantçabal 
et al. 2011, Rapela et al. 2011) and Encantadas Microplate 
(Chemale Jr. 2000) occur as “basement inliers” in all geotec-
tonic units of the DFB and are represented by Paleoproterozoic 
gneisses. The Paleoproterozoic rocks comprise associations 
formed in three main events:
1. the Santa Maria Chico (Siderian, 2.4-2.35 Ga),
2. the Encantadas (Rhyacian, 2.2–2.0 Ga), and
3. the Seival event (Statherian 1.8–1.7 Ga).

After that, the continental crust in southern Brazil 
experienced a period of tectonic quiescence which was 
marked by the emplacement of basic-ultrabasic complexes 
of Callymian age (1.57–1.55 Ga), represented by the 
Capivarita  meta-anortosite (Chemale Jr. et al. 2011) and 
by the Tupi Silveira Amphibolite (Camozzato et al. 2013). 

The Taquarembó Terrane (TT) is located in the southwest-
ern portion of the shield and represents the largest exposed 
fragment of the Nico Perez Terrane (Fig. 4). The TT comprises 
the Paleoproterozoic Santa Maria Chico Granulitic Complex 
which is intruded by Neoproterozoic granites and covered by 
the volcano-sedimentary sequence of the Camaquã Basin. 

GEOTECTONIC UNITS OF 
THE DOM FELICIANO BELT

São Gabriel Terrane 
The São Gabriel Terrane (SGT) forms the western portion 

of the DFB and has an elongated shape in the N20 – 30°E 
direction, underlying an area of approximately 110 x 60 km 
(Fig. 3). This region is covered in the west and north by 
the Phanerozoic units of the Paraná Basin, and is limited 
to the south by the N70W – S70oE trending Ibaré Shear 
Zone (ISZ) and to the east by the Caçapava do Sul Shear 
Zone (CSSZ). Geophysical modelling of the Caçapava do 
Sul lineament shows that this structure is deep-seated and 
may be interpreted as the suture zone between the São 
Gabriel and Tijucas terranes (Chemale Jr. 2000 and ref-
erences therein). The SGT consists of remanents of ophi-
olitic complexes and three Neoproterozoic magmatic arcs; 
the older is an intraoceanic arc (Passinho), and the younger 
represent active continental margins (São Gabriel and Dom 
Feliciano) (Fig. 3).

The units of the SGT are strongly controlled by N30 – 
40oE trending shear zones, which are rotated to the N70oW 
direction by the Ibaré Shear Zone (ISZ) in the southern 
limit of the terrane. This tectonic linear structure is easily 
recognized by magnetic anomalies, as well by the elliptical 

shape of the plutonic bodies of the Neoproterozoic Seival 
Association.

The different rock units of the SGT may be grouped 
into three main petrotectonic associations:
1. the Palma Accretionary Prism,
2. Arc-related Associations and
3. the Seival volcano-sedimentary-plutonic association 

(Fig. 5).

The Palma Accretionary Prism is made of tectonic slabs 
of ophiolitic complexes, comprising magnesian schist, ser-
pentinite and amphibolite, with subordinate metaperidot-
ite, metagabbro and metapyroxenite. The Arc Association is 
composed of the Passinho and São Gabriel arc rocks, rep-
resented by metavolcano-sedimentary associations formed 
between ca. 0.89 and 0.68 Ga (Machado  et  al. 1990, 
Babinski et al. 1996, Leite et al. 1998, Remus et al. 1999, 
Hartmann et al. 2011, Lena et al. 2014, Philipp et al. 2014). 
The Pontas do Salso Complex is a late-orogenic arc-related 
basin, younger than 0.68 Ga and part of the São Gabriel 
Terrane (Vedana et al. 2016). These associations are in 
tectonic contact with passive margin metasedimentary 
association represented by the Passo Feio and Marmeleiro 
complexes. The Seival volcano-sedimentary-plutonic asso-
ciation formed between 0.61 and 0.54 Ga, representing the 
late to post-orogenic stages of the Dom Feliciano Orogeny 
(Chemale Jr., 2000).

Palma Accretionary Prism

Ophiolitic Complexes 
The mafic-ultramafic complexes comprise amphibolite 

and metaultramafic rocks including serpentinized harzburg-
ite, metapyroxenite, metagabbro, serpentinite and Mg-rich 
schist with tholeiitic signature (Leite et al. 1998; Remus et al. 
1999; Chemale Jr. 2000). Five major ophiolite complexes, 
Palma, Passo do Ivo, Cerro Mantiqueira, Cambaizinho and 
Arroio Lajeadinho occur elongated bodies parallel to regional 
structures (Figs. 5 and 6).

The metaultramafic rocks present M1 assemblage comprising 
antophilite+forsterite+enstatite, defining conditions of medium 
to high grade with low pressure (Leite et al. 1998, Chemale Jr. 
2000). Younger metamorphic events were accompanied by the 
formation of ductile shear zones which characterize the later 
regional deformation and mark the M2 greenschist facies meta-
morphism. The authors interpreted the amphibolite metamor-
phism (M1) and the late greenschist facies event (M2) as related 
to the São Gabriel and Dom Feliciano events, respectively. Relicts 
of olivine and spinels have chemical composition typical of 
ophiolitic rocks. U-Pb SHRIMP zircon ages for metasomatic 
albitites formed during low-temperature serpentinization of

ultramafic rocks of the Cerro Mantiqueira and Ibaré ophiolites 
are 923 ± 3 Ma and 892 ± 3 Ma, respectively, which are inter-
preted by Arena and Hartmann (2015) as the emplacement age 
of these ophiolites. Metamorphic rims dated at 787 ± 13 Ma 
were determined in the Cerro Mantiqueira ophiolite. 

Arc Associations 

Passinho Arc 
The rocks of the Passinho Arc are exposed in the south-

ern portion of the SGT in an area located south and north of 

the Cerro da Mantiqueira Ophiolite (Figs. 5 and 6). The arc 
rocks occur as an EW elongated belt and are represented by 
orthogneisses of the Imbicuí Complex. It includes tonalitic 
to trondhjemitic gneisses in the central portion, involved 
by diorite gneisses (Lusa et al. 2016) (Fig. 6). The gneisses 
present tholeiitic to low-K calc-alkaline chemical compo-
sition and have crystallization ages between ca. 890 and 
860 Ma. Dioritic gneisses exposed to the south of the Cerro 
Mantiqueiras complex have SHRIMP U-Pb ages of 879 ± 
14 Ma (Leite et al. 1998), and LA-ICPMS ages of 890 ± 9 Ma 
and 885 ± 3 Ma (Philipp et al. 2014; Lusa et al. 2016). They

are intruded by diorites and tonalites related to the Cambaí 
Complex with U-Pb ages between 740 and 710 Ma (Leite 
et al. 1998, Lusa et al. 2016). To the east, these units are 
covered by the sedimentary rocks of the Maricá Formation 
of the Camaquã Basin.

The regional metamorphism of the Imbicuí Complex is 
marked by the assemblage plagioclase + hornblende + biotite 
and plagioclase + hornblende + diopside, indicative of P-T 
conditions of the mid-to upper amphibolite facies, with low 
pressure. A retrograde metamorphic event is marked by a 
greenschist to lower amphibolite paragenesis formed of albite 
+ actinolite/hornblende + chlorite + epidote + white mica.

São Gabriel Arc
Rocks of the São Gabriel Arc are exposed in a large area 

extending from São Gabriel, Vila Nova do Sul and São Sepé, 
in the west, to Lavras do Sul, in the south (Fig. 5). The São 
Gabriel Arc consists of metavolcano-sedimentary rocks of the 
Bossoroca Complex, orthogneiss and metagranitic rocks of 
the Cambaí Complex, late- to post-collisional granites and dio-
rites of the Lagoa da Meia Lua Suite, and mafic to ultramafic 
rocks of the Mata Grande Complex. These rocks are interlayered 
with the ophiolitic complexes and with metasedimentary rocks 
of the Cambaizinho and Passo Feio complexes, and are covered 
by the metasedimentary rocks of the Pontas do Salso Complex.

Metavolcanic Rocks
The Bossoroca Complex consists of Neoproterozoic 

metavolcano-sedimentary rocks including acid to interme-
diate metatuffs and metalapilli tuffs and lava flows (metad-
acites, meta-andesites and metabasalts), which are associated 
with metapelitic, carbonaceous and chemical metasediments 
(Machado et al. 1990, Remus et al. 1999; Gubert et al. 2016). 
Metavolcanoclastic rocks, pillowed metabasalts, amphibole 
schists and amphibolites exposed in the western part of the 
Passo Feio Complex may be correlated with the metavolcanic 
associations of the Bossoroca Complex, according to the exist-
ing petrographic and geochemical data. The metavolcanic rocks 
have low- to medium-K calc-alkaline composition. Machado 
et al. (1990) reported the TIMS U-Pb age of ca. 753 Ma for 
a metadacite, which is identical to the U-Pb SHRIMP age 
of 756 ± 14 Ma reported by Remus et al. (1999) and U-Pb 
LA-ICP-MS of 767 ± 3 Ma and 765 ± 10 Ma reported by 
Gubert et al. (2016). Remus et al. (1999) and Hartmann et al. 
(2011) obtained ages of ca. 700 Ma for the metamorphic event 
that affected this sequence. 

Metagranitic Rocks 
The Cambaí Complex (CC) is composed of two magmatic 

associations: (i) tonalitic, trondhjemitic and dioritic gneiss, and 
(ii) intrusive metatonalites, metagranodiorites and metadiorites 

(Fig. 7). The paragneisses of the Cambaizinho Complex are either 
interlayered with or occur as xenoliths in the CC. Rocks of the 
CC are metaluminous, have mid- to high-K calc-alkaline chem-
ical composition and are cut by undeformed intrusions of the 
Lagoa da Meia Lua Suite (Hartmann et al. 2011). The Cambaí 
gneisses yielded U-Pb SHRIMP and LA-ICP-MS zircon ages 
of ca. 740 and 720 Ma, interpreted by Hartmann et al. (2011) 
and Vedana et al. (2016) as the age of igneous crystallization. 
U-Pb SHRIMP zircon ages of slightly deformed tonalites and 
diorites of the CC are between ca. 710 and 690 Ma (Babinski 
et al. 1996, Hartmann et al. 2011), and those reported for 
tonalites and diorites in the Lavras do Sul region are in the 
range between 740 and 720 Ma (Leite et al. 1998, Lusa et al. 
2016). Rocks of the CC present positive initial ?Nd values and 
low initial 86Sr/87Sr ratios (Saalmann et al. 2005), indicating 
juvenile nature of the original magmas (Babinski et al. 1996). 

The Lagoa da Meia Lua Suite (LMLS) is made of 
tonalite-granodiorite to diorite forming N20 – 30oE elon-
gated bodies, concordant with the main ductile shear zones 
of the SGT. This suite includes the youngest magmatic 
rocks of the São Gabriel orogen and is intrusive into the 
Cambaizinho and Cambaí complexes (Fig. 7). The LMLS 
represents a late to post-orogenic intrusive event, including 
the Capivara Diorite, the Sanga do Jobim Granodiorite, the 
Cerca de Pedra Granodiorite and the Buriti Tonalite (Garavaglia 
et al., 2002 Hartmann et al. 2011 and references therein). 
The SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages indicate that the granitoid 
emplacement occurred between 700 and 680 Ma, including 
ages of 703 ± 7 Ma for the Buriti Tonalite, 704 ± 3 Ma for 
the Santa Zélia Granite, 690 ± 2 Ma for the BR-290 tonalite, 
694 ± 5 Ma for the BR-290 trondhjemite, 682 ± 2 Ma for the 
Cerca de Pedra Granodiorite, and 680 ± 2 Ma for the Sanga 
do Jobim Granodiorite (Hartmann et al. 2011).

The Mata Grande and the Pedra Pretas complexes are 
the two main mafic plutonic bodies of the Lagoa da Meia 
Lua Suite. The Mata Grande is a layered intrusion com-
posed by gabbro-peridotite and other cumulate rock units 
dated by LA-ICPMS U-Pb zircon method at 668 ± 3 Ma 
(Simões et al. 2014). 

The metasedimentary rocks of the Pontas do Salso Complex 
are exposed in the southeastern portion of the SGT. Meta-
arkoses are dominant, with subordinate lenses of conglomer-
atic meta-arkoses and phyllites. The metaconglomerates and 
meta-sandstones are immature with clasts of metavolcanic and 
granitic rocks with andesitic to dacitic composition and medi-
um-K calc-alkaline affinity (Vedana et al. 2016). Petrographic 
and geochemical data indicate that the sources of the 
metasedimentary rocks were metavolcanic and metagranitic 
rocks of the Passinho and São Gabriel arcs. LA-ICP-MS detri-
tal zircon provenance data for a meta-arkoses and muscovite 
phyllite indicated that the sources of the complex have ages

Ruy Paulo Philipp et al.



between 900 and 680 Ma (Vedana et al. 2016). The youngest 
ages suggest that the complex represents a late- to post-oro-
genic basin and the collapse of the São Gabriel Arc.

Metasedimentary Complexes 
The Cambaizinho and Passo Feio complexes together 

with the ophiolitic rocks are the oldest units of the SGT. 
Both supracrustal units occur as km-long elongated strips, 
as well as metric-decametric xenoliths and roof pendants, 
in the Cambaí Complex metagranitoids and in the granites 
of the LMLS (Hartmann et al. 2011). 

The Cambaizinho Complex (CbC) (Lena et al. 2014) com-
prises metapelitic gneisses with intercalations of calc-silicate 
rocks, marbles and impure quartzite. Metamorphic paragen-
esis as biotite + garnet + staurolite and plagioclase + quartz + 
diopside + grossular indicates metamorphism in mid- to upper 
amphibolite facies conditions. Sm-Nd isotope data presented 
by Saalmann et al. (2005) indicate that the original sediments of 
the Cambaizinho Complex derived from the erosion of juvenile 
rocks of the Passinho and São Gabriel arcs. Lena et al. (2014) 

presented the results of combined SHRIMP and LA-ICP-MS 
U-Pb ages of detrital zircon grains from the metasedimentary 
rocks of the Cambaizinho Complex. Igneous ages range from 
840 to 700 Ma, with a peak around 750 and 700 Ma, suggest-
ing that the tectonic setting of the original sediments was part 
of a fore-arc or back-arc basin. The ?18O values of the detrital 
zircon varied from +3.2 to +9.6% and are grouped into three 
distinct groups of sediment sources. They point to a progres-
sive evolution of the São Gabriel Terrane from an intraoceanic 
arc to a continental active margin.

The Passo Feio Complex (PFC) is exposed in the eastern 
part of the SGT and was defined as a sequence of metapelite, 
marble, calc-silicate rocks and quartzite, intercalated with 
amphibolite, metavolcanic/metavolcanoclastic rocks and 
magnesium schist (Figs. 3 and 5). The U-Pb SHRIMP 
zircon provenance work was carried out by Remus et al. 
(2000) in one sample from the northwestern part of the 
PFC, and show zircon grains ranging in age from Archean 
to Neoproterozoic. Based on U-Pb detrital zircon data of 
the Passo Feio Complex metasedimentary rocks, Lopes et al.

(2015) recognized also zircon ages ranging from 0.803 to 
3.637 Ga with Neo, Meso and Paleoproterozoic and Archean 
distribution pattern, suggesting that the PFC was originated 
from the erosion of complex continental sources.

Tijucas Terrane 
The Tijucas Terrane (TjT) is elongated in the N30 – 40oE 

direction, extending for 170 km with width between 15 and 
30 km (Fig. 8). It is in tectonic contact with the SGT to the west 
along the Caçapava do Sul Shear Zone. The eastern boundary, 
with the Pelotas Batholith, is marked by the strike-slip Dorsal do 
Canguçu Shear Zone (e.g.: Fernandes et al. 1992, Philipp et al. 
2003). The northeastern contact of the TjT with the Pelotas 
Batholith is affected by the Passo do Marinheiro Shear Zone. 

The TjT consists of:
1. a basement inlier made of Paleoproterozoic orthogneis-

ses of the Encantadas and Vigia complexes,
2. Statherian Seival Metagranite,
3. Calymminian Tupi Silveira Amphibolite, and
4. Neoproterozoic metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks 

of the Porongos Complex (Saalmann et al. 2005) (Fig. 8).

Basement orthogneisses are exposed in the core of large-
scale antiforms known as the Santana da Boa Vista Dome 
and as the Vigia Dome in the Hulha Negra region (Fig. 9).

Basement Domes 
The Santana da Boa Vista and Vigia Domes are surrounded 

by metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks of the Porongos 
Complex. The contact between the complexes is represented 
by a low-angle ductile shear zone marked by mylonites which 
obliterate the original stratigraphic relationships.

Encantadas Complex 
The Encantadas Complex (EC) is a Paleoproterozoic 

(Siderian and Rhyacian) unit composed of dioritic, tonalitic 
and trondhjemitic gneisses with minor amphibolite and 
hornblende-rich metaultramafic rocks, where gneisses are 
metaluminous to slightly peraluminous, with medium-K 
calc-alkaline nature, representing a typical high-Al TTG 
association (Philipp et al. 2008, 2016b) (Fig. 8). This meta-
morphic complex is intruded by Rhyacian mylonitic monzo- 
and syenogranitic gneisses (Philipp et al. 2008, 2016b).

The EC tonalitic gneisses have SHRIMP U-Pb crystal-
lization zircon ages of 2.340 Ma, whereas intrusive monzo-
granitic to syenogranitic mylonitic gneisses present Rhyacian 
LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages of 2.211 ± 17 Ma and 2.210 ± 16 Ma 
(Philipp et al. 2016b). The gneiss was metamorphosed under 
upper amphibolite facies conditions during the Orosirian 
(2.040 ± 10 Ma and 2.020 ± 11 Ma) (Hartmann et al. 2003). 
Zircon grains from the EC orthogneiss in the Hulha Negra and 

Candiota regions display two LA-ICP-MS U-Pb age popula-
tions: (i) Siderian ages of ca 2.40 to 2.35 Ga and (ii) Rhyacian 
ages, with values of ca 2.23 Ga to 2.15 Ga (Camozzato et al. 
2013). In the Vigia Dome region, in Hulha Negra, the EC 
orthogneisses are intruded by the Seival Metagranite and by 
theTupi Silveira Amphibolite. The tonalitic gneisses of the EC 
have U-Pb crystallization ages of 2.112 ± 22 Ma and 2.153 ± 
20 Ma, as well as a concordia age of 643 ±13 Ma for meta-
morphic zircon grains (Camozzato et al. 2013). 

Vigia Complex
The Vigia Complex (VC) is a Paleoproterozoic (Rhyacian) 

unit composed of dioritic, tonalitic and trondhjemitic gneisses 
with minor amphibolite exposed at the southern portion of the 
Tijucas Terrane (Camozzato et al. 2013) (Fig. 8). This metamor-
phic complex is intruded by the Seival Metagranite, an elongate 
NE-SW pluton of Sthaterian age that intrudes the VC in the 
southeastern portion of the Vigia Dome (Fig. 9). Geochemical 
data indicate that the VC gneisses are metaluminous to slightly 
peraluminous, with medium to high-K calc-alkaline nature, char-
acterizing a high-Al TTG association (Camozzato et al. 2013). 

The VC tonalitic gneisses have LA-ICP-MS crystal-
lization zircon ages of 2.05 – 2.04 Ga (Camozzato et al. 
2013). In the Vigia Dome region, in Hulha Negra, the VC 
orthogneisses are intruded by the Seival Metagranite and 
by theTupi Silveira Amphibolite. 

Seival Metagranite 
The Seival Metagranite (SM) is a 40 x 10 km pluton elon-

gated in the N30oE direction, intrusive into the VC gneiss in 
the southeastern portion of the Vigia Dome (Fig. 9). The meta-
granite has a monzogranite to granodiorite composition and 
present equigranular texture made of K-feldspar, plagioclase, 
quartz and biotite (&amp;lt;5%). Geochemical data indicate high-K 
calc-alkaline composition, with metaluminous to slightly per-
aluminous nature, and trace element characteristics similar 
to those of evolved arc-related associations (Camozzato et al. 
2013). Three samples of the SM were dated and yielded U-Pb 
LA-ICP-MS ages of 1.785 ± 42 Ma, 1.768 ± 24 Ma and 1.764 ± 
29 Ma, revealing, therefore, a previously unknown Statherian 
granitic magmatism in southern Brazil (Camozzato et al. 2013).

Tupi Silveira Amphibolite 
The Tupi Silveira Amphibolite (TSA) crops out in the 

southern portion of the Vigia Dome, comprising two bod-
ies about 1 – 2 km in length, elongated in the N10oE and 
N30oE directions (Fig. 9). The bodies are intrusive into the VC 
gneisses, although direct contact relationships have not been 
observed. The amphibolites present a regular and continuous 
banding of milimetric thickness and polygonal granoblastic 
texture defined by plagioclase, hornblende, garnet and rare

diopside. U-Pb age of one sample of the TSA revealed the 
crystallization age of 1.567 ± 21 Ma (Camozzato et al. 2013). 
This is similar to the 1.573 ± 21 Ma age of the Capivarita 
Anorthosite (Chemale Jr. et al. 2011). These units represent 
a Calymminian anorogenic magmatic event characterized by 
basic and ultrabasic layered complexes. After crystallization, 
both units were affected by collisional metamorphism under 
granulite facies, between ca. 650 and 620 Ma.

Metavolcano-sedimentary complexes

Porongos Complex 
The Porongos Complex (PC) is a Neoproterozoic 

metavolcano-sedimentary sequence and one of the main 

units of the TjT (Fig. 3). The supracrustal succession com-
prises two sequences (Fig. 8). The south and southeastern 
sequence consists of a pile of quartzite, schists and marble 
lenses, interlayered with metarhyolites, metadacites and 
meta-andesites. The northern sequence is younger and 
consists of metapelites and quartzites intercalated with 
Ediacaran felsic metavolcanic rocks represented by fine-
grained crystal metatuffs and metadacites and intruded 
by alkaline granite (Saalmann et al. 2010). The metamor-
phism ranges from greenschist to amphibolite facies with 
intermediate pressure.

SHRIMP and LA-ICP-MS provenance studies have 
shown that metasedimentary rocks of the PC derived from 
two main sources. The metasedimentary rocks in the lower

and dominant part of the complex (Santana da Boa Vista 
region) were derived from the erosion of Archean, Paleo- and 
Mesoproterozoic sources with ages between 2.9 and 2.0 Ga, 
and between 1.6 and 1.0 Ga, respectively (Hartmann et al. 
2004, Gruber et al. 2011, Pertile et al. 2015a,b). Recent 
studies in the Cachoeira do Sul region, northern part of the 
complex, indicate that the rocks in this sector derived from 
Neoproterozoic sources (Gruber et al. 2011, Pertile et al. 
2015a,b). LA-ICP-MS U-Pb detrital zircon ages between 
850 and 700 Ma suggest that this part of the basin represents 
a back-arc or a foreland basin. New SHRIMP U-Pb analy-
ses of metadacites and meta-andesites of the Santana da Boa 
Vista and of metarhyolites of the Piratini region gave age 
values of 798 ± 6 Ma, 801 ± 5 Ma, 807 ± 7 Ma and 803 ± 
4 Ma to Cerro da Árvore metadacites (unpublished data). 

Two groups of granite intrusions in the PC are recognized:
1. peraluminous granites with muscovite, garnet and tour-

maline and
2. alkaline leucogranites with Fe-rich biotite and/or sodic 

pyroxene (Capané and Candiotinha type metagranite).

These granites are deformed and emplaced along the S2 
regional foliation. The compositional and textural characteris-
tics were highlighted by Camozzato et al. (2012) who correlated 
the pearluminous granites with the intrusions of the Cordilheira 
Suite. U-Pb LA-ICP-MS data on zircon indicate crystallization at 
589 ± 25 Ma for the Candiotinha Metagranite (Camozzato et al. 
2013) and 601 ± 7 Ma for the Capané Metagranite (unpublished 
data). The ages obtained on the overgrowths of zircon crystals 
and titanite indicates metamorphism at ca. 540 Ma. 

Pelotas Batholith
The Pelotas Batholith is composed of a set of Neoproterozoic 

(Ediacaran) granitic suites, generated during and after the 
climax of the Dom Feliciano orogeny. The granitic suites are 
elongated in the N50 – 70oE direction, and their genera-
tion and emplacement were controlled by high angle ductile 
transcurrent shear zones. The batholith is a multi-intrusive 
400 x 120 km plutonic complex including granite, gab-
bro and diorite, as well as rhyolitic to basaltic dikes swarms 
(Fig. 10) (Philipp &amp;amp; Machado 2005). The granitoids repre-
sent an early generation of high-K calc-alkaline suites with 
metaluminous to peraluminous affinity, followed by alka-
line magmatism and, finally, less voluminous peralkaline 
intrusions (Philipp &amp;amp; Machado 2005, Oliveira et al. 2015). 
Shear zones in the batholith are defined by mylonitic belts 
with sub-vertical foliation, accompanied by sub-hori-
zontal stretching lineation, and were active during the 
development of the batholith, controlling the intrusion of 
the granitic suites (Fig. 10) (Fernandes et al. 1992, Koester 
et al. 2001b, Philipp et al. 2003). Syn-collisional episodes 

of compressional ductile movements were followed by an 
extensional post-collisional period.

The emplacement of the different intrusions took place 
between 650 and 550 Ma, but only a small proportion of the 
granite plutons have been precisely dated. The available Sr and 
Nd isotopic data suggest reworking of Paleoproterozoic conti-
nental crust (Philipp et al. 2003, 2007). The oldest unit of the 
batholith is the Quitéria Granite, followed by the Cordilheira 
Suite, Pinheiro Machado Complex, and the Viamão, Erval, 
Piquiri, Encruzilhada do Sul, Dom Feliciano and the Itapuã 
suites (Koester et al. 2001a,b, Frantz et al. 2003, Philipp et al. 
2002, 2003, 2013). Despite the fact that diorites are com-
monly associated with the granitoids, Sr and Nd isotope data 
indicate a common trend of high 87Sr/86Sr initial ratios and 
negative ?Nd values. The Sm-Nd (TDM) model ages are in the 
interval between 1.100 and 2.100 Ma, supporting, therefore, 
origin of the granitic melts by anatexis of older crustal rocks 
(Koester et al. 2001b, Philipp et al. 2003, 2013, 2016a).

Granitic Suites 
The Quitéria Metagranite is the oldest granite in the batho-

lith, with a U-Pb SHRIMP zircon age of 658 ± 4 Ma (Frantz 
et al. 2003). In the Quitéria region, the peraluminous granites of 
the Cordilheira Suite have U-Pb SHRIMP zircon ages between 
ca. 634 and 625 ± 6 Ma (Cordilheira and Francisquinho gran-
ites) and 605 ± 8 Ma (Figueiras granite) (Frantz et al. 2003). 
New LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon ages of peraluminous leucogranite 
in migmatitic pelitic gneiss of the Varzea do Capivarita Complex 
indicate crystallization at 620 ± 6 Ma, whereas metamorphic 
zircon grains of the migmatitic gneisses have the age of 619 ± 
5 Ma. This indicates that the granitic magmatism of the Quitéria 
region represents the early stages of formation of the Pelotas 
Batholith (Philipp et al. 2013, 2016a). 

The collisional peak was controlled by compression and 
new shear episodes along the Dorsal de Canguçu Shear Zone, 
associated with the generation of granitic to basic magmas, 
suggesting important anatexis. This event culminated in the 
generation of the granites of the Pinheiro Machado Complex 
and Viamão Suite. These suites present U-Pb and Pb-Pb TIMS 
zircon ages between 630 and 620 Ma (Babinski et al. 1997, 
Philipp et al. 2002, 2003, Silva et al. 1997). The geochro-
nological data available for the Viamão Suite granites indi-
cate U-Pb TIMS zircon ages of 595 ± 1 Ma for the Arroio 
Moinho Granite (Babinski et al. 1997), 630 ± 6 Ma for the 
Viamão Granite, and a LA-ICP-MS age of 627 ± 16 Ma for 
the Barão do Triunfo Granite (Philipp et al. 2016c).

Late to post-collisional reactivation of the shear zones 
between ca. 610 and 550 Ma resulted in the emplacement of 
the alkaline and peralkaline Piquiri and Encruzilhada do Sul 
suites, and high-K calc-alkaline to alkaline granites of the Dom 
Feliciano suite (Vasquez, 1997, Philipp et al. 2003). Zircon from

syenites of the Piquiri Suite were dated by Pb-Pb evapora-
tion TIMS method, with ages of 611 ± 3 Ma for the Piquiri 
Syenite and 612 ± 3 Ma for the Arroio Silva Syenite (Philipp 
et al. 2002). Granites of the Encruzilhada do Sul Suite have the 
U-Pb TIMS zircon age of 595 ± 4 Ma (Babinski et al. 1997) 
and the Rb-Sr isochron age of 587 ± 7 Ma (Vasquez 1997). 
A new U-Pb LA-ICP-MS zircon age obtained by Philipp et al. 
(2016c) showed a value of 595 ± 8 Ma for the porphyritic facies 
of the Encruzilhada do Sul Granite.

The northern portion of the Pelotas Batholith is 
dominated by the voluminous post-collisional leucogran-
ites of the Dom Feliciano Suite, emplaced at the end of the 
Neoproterozoic. The Ponta Grossa Granite has the U-Pb 
TIMS zircon age of 600 ± 9 Ma (Philipp et al. 2016c). A 
pegmatoid leucogranite cutting the Porto Alegre Gneiss 
crystallized at 585 ± 6 Ma with inheritance at 739 ± 45 Ma. 
According to Oliveira et al. (2001), the Itapuã Suite includes 
granitoids and dike swarms of alkaline affinity that were 
previously included in the Dom Feliciano Suite. The suite 
comprises granite, syenogranite,  quartz-syenite and subor-
dinate syenite, as well as a dyke swarms of comenditic rhy-
olite to basalt with alkaline to peralkaline affinity (Oliveira 
et al. 2015). A U-Pb SHRIMP zircon age of 600 ± 3 Ma 
was reported for the Santana Granite (Koester et al. 2001a). 
New U-Pb LA-ICP-MS zircon data obtained indicated ages 
around 550 Ma for the felsic dikes (Oliveira et al. 2015). 

Basement inliers and xenoliths
During ascent and emplacement, the granitic suites cap-

tured xenoliths of the country rocks with dimensions of up to 
several kilometers across. Petrographic, geochemical and struc-
tural data for these xenoliths show that they are comparable to 
the adjacent metamorphic units of the Nico Perez Microplate. 
Basement inliers are represented by low to high grade meta-
morphic rocks, which occur in large areas in the northern por-
tion of the batholith and as xenoliths of centimetric to deca-
metric dimensions in the central and southern areas. The main 
exposures are within granites of the Encruzilhada do Sul Suite, 
and are xenoliths of paragneisses of the Várzea do Capivarita 
Complex (VCC) and orthogneisses of the Arroio dos Ratos 
Complex (ARC) (Fernandes et al. 1992, Philipp et al. 2016a). 
In the same region, in the northern part of the Pelotas Batholith, 
is the Capivarita Anorthosite (CA) (Chemale et al. 2011). 

Large exposures of the VCC and ARC occur as “roof pen-
dants” in granitoids of the Encruzilhada do Sul Suite and, to a 
lesser extent, of the Cordilheira Suite. The ARC is composed 
of tonalite to granodiorite gneisses cut by granites, and present 
tectonic contacts with the VCC paragneiss (Martil et al. 2011, 
Gregory et al. 2015). Rocks of both complexes were metamor-
phosed under medium to high grade metamorphic conditions 
(Lima et al. 1998, Gross et al. 2006, Philipp et al. 2013). In this 

area, the Capivarita Anorthosite and other Paleoproterozoic base-
ment rocks record the collisional metamorphism under upper 
amphibolite to granulite facies conditions (Fernandes et al. 1992, 
Chemale Jr. et al. 2011, Philipp et al. 2016a). The magmatic ages 
of orthogneisses of the ARC are ca. 2.2 – 2.0 Ga (Leite et al. 
2000, Silva et al. 2005, Gregory et al. 2015) with juvenile sig-
natures and metamorphism at 631 ± 13 Ma (Silva et al. 2005). 

Several other smaller gneiss bodies were described high-
lighting the widespread occurrence of high grade ortho- and 
paragneiss, and also the presence of large xenoliths of schist, 
quartzite and marble of the Porongos Complex in the Herval 
and Pedro Osório regions (Philipp et al. 2003). 

The Porto Alegre gneisses have been correlated with the 
ARC rocks (Philipp et al. 2004). Recently, however, Koester 
et al. (2016) presented a Neoproterozoic U-Pb SHRIMP zircon 
age of 789 ± 13 Ma for the Chácara das Pedras orthogneiss, 
indicating probably a new arc generation. The xenoliths of 
tonalitic gneiss inside of the gneiss present a U-Pb LA-ICP-MS 
zircon age of 1.993 ± 25 Ma, probably related to inheritance 
of ARC gneisses (Philipp et al. 2016c). 

Based on the pseudosection investigation and in the para-
genesis garnet-cordierite-sillimanite-biotite, the metamorphism 
of the VCC occurred at 720 – 820o C and pressure of 8 to 9 
kbar, characterizing it as of intermediate pressure and high 
temperature series (Philipp et al. 2013). Metamorphic zircon 
grains of a garnet-sillimanite-biotite gneiss of the VCC and of 
an associated peraluminous leucogranite were dated at 620 ± 
5 Ma (main metamorphism) and at 612 ± 6 Ma for the crys-
tallization of the leucogranite (Philipp et al. 2016a). 

U-Pb dating of magmatic and metamorphic zircon grains 
of the Capivarita Anorthosite yielded the age of 1573 ± 21 Ma 
and of 606 ± 6 Ma, respectively, whereas titanite grains have 
the igneous crystallization age of 1530 ± 33 Ma and metamor-
phic ages of 651 ± 9 Ma and 601 ± 5 Ma (Chemale Jr. et al. 
2011). The older metamorphic age is interpreted as the age 
of collisional metamorphism and the younger ages are related 
to the contact metamorphism produced by the Encruzilhada 
do Sul Granite. The Lu-Hf model ages of the CA showed two 
clusters: from 1.81 to 2.03 Ga (?Hf from +2.2 to +6.4) and 
from 2.55 to 2.62 Ga (?Hf from -4.59 to -5.64). This mag-
matism may represent an important episode of continental 
accretion in an extensional setting during fragmentation of 
a supercontinent in the Early Mesoproterozoic.

The Seival volcano-sedimentary-
plutonic Association

The plutonic-volcano-sedimentary Seival Association 
represents the late to post-orogenic stages of the Dom 
Feliciano Event (Paim et al. 2000, Chemale Jr. 2000). 

The main unit of this association is the Camaquã Basin, 
comprising four depositional successions associated with 

98

Tectonic evolution of the Dom Feliciano Belt



NE-SW shear zones (Fig. 3). In the last three sequences, the 
shear zones and extensional faults probably reached the mantle 
and lower crust levels and generated the volcanic rocks of the 
Hilário (Bom Jardim Group), Acampamento Velho (Santa 
Bárbara Group) and Rodeio formations (Guaritas Group). 
Large shoshonite to high-K calc-alkaline magmatism defined 
by elongated volcanic bodies parallel to the main transcurrent 
fault systems are suggestive of the role of these structures in 
the depositional control and also in the origin of magmatism. 

Two main granitoid suites were generated in this period:
1. Shoshonitic to high-K calc-alkaline and
2. alkaline granites.

The emplacement of the shoshonitic granitoids such as 
the Lavras do Sul is associated with the deposition of the 
Bom Jardim Group, whereas the sedimentary and volcanic 
rocks of the Santa Barbara Group are contemporaneous with 
the emplacement of the Acampamento Velho Formation 
rhyolites and high-K calc-alkaline granitoids such as the 
Caçapava do Sul Granite and of alkaline granitoids such as 
the Jaguari, Ramada, Cerro da Cria and São Sepé granites.

Camaquã Basin
Sedimentary rocks of the Camaquã Basin have ages 

between 600 Ma and 540 Ma (Paim et al. 2000, Chemale Jr. 
2000, Oliveira et al. 2014). The basin is formed by different 
sedimentary and volcano-sedimentary units, with associated 
plutonic rocks, and separated from each other by angular or 
erosional unconformities of regional character. The basin was 
filled and deformed during the late stages of the Brasiliano 
orogeny. The deposition is believed to have evolved from 
marine environments (Maricá Group), through transitional 
between marine and lacustrine conditions (Bom Jardim and 
Santa Barbara Groups) to fluvial and lacustrine environ-
ments (Guaritas Group) (Figs. 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9). The first 
two cycles are controlled by NE-SW shear zones associated 
with transcurrent compressive tectonics under ruptile-duc-
tile conditions. The last three depositional episodes started 
with the eruption of volcanic rocks with tholeiitic, high-K 
calc-alkaline to shoshonitic characteristics (Hilário Formation, 
Bom Jardim Group), changing later to bimodal tholeiitic to 
sodic alkaline nature (Acampamento Velho Formation, Santa 
Barbara Group) and finishing with alkaline basaltic volcanics 
(Rodeio Velho Formation, Guaritas Group) (Wildner et al. 
2002, Sommer et al. 2005, Janikian et al. 2012). 

The Maricá Group is interpreted to be formed as 
retro-arc foreland basin due collision of the Rio de la 
Plata and Encantadas microcontinent (Borba et al. 2006, 
2008). The overlying Bom Jardim Group is resulted from 
transpressive tectonics and associated volcanism (Paim 
et al. 2000). The upper section of the Camaquã Basin is a 

transtensional rift basin developed when amalgamation of 
the shield was already completed (Oliveira et al. 2015). The 
high-K calc-alkaline plutons have SHRIMP and LA-ICP-MS 
U-Pb ages between 598 and 570 Ma, whereas the alkaline 
plutons crystallized between 570 – 550 Ma. 

EVOLUTION OF THE DOM 
FELICIANO BELT

The early evolution of the DFB involved the deformation 
of the sedimentary rocks at the western passive margin of the 
Nico Perez Microplate and of the Paleoproterozoic units of the 
sialic basement (Fig. 11). The metamorphic evolution of the 
Dom Deliciano belt took place during two main collisional 
events. The first collision occurred between the arc systems 
(Passinho and São Gabriel) and the Nico Perez Microplate 
at ca. 720 – 710 Ma along the western portion of the belt, 
associated with the closure of the Charrua Ocean. Subduction 
related low- to medium-K calc-alkaline plutonic and volca-
no-sedimentary associations are represented in the São Gabriel 
Terrane by the Passinho and São Gabriel arcs (Saalmann et al. 
2005, 2010). The second and most important collisional 
event is believed to have been an oblique collision between 
the RLPC/Nico Perez Microplate (or Encantadas Microplate, 
Chemale Jr. 2000) and the Kalahari Craton between 650 and 
620 Ma (Chemale Jr. et al. 2011, Camozzato et al. 2012, 
2013, Gregory et al. 2015, Philipp et al. 2016a). This event 
also caused the strong deformation of the arc related rocks, 
passive margin sedimentary rocks and of units of the sialic 
basement. The process led to the anatexis of the metamor-
phic units (Philipp et al. 2013, 2016a). 

The Basement
The margins of the Nico Perez Microplate in RS is extremely 

deformed and affected by two main events (800 – 760 Ma 
and 650 – 550 Ma) and by intense granitic magmatism with 
subordinate volcanic rocks. Isotopic data suggest that frag-
ments of the Nico Perez Microplate are widespread in many 
areas of the DFB. These gneisses are Paleoproterozoic, and 
their parental granitic rocks formed during three orogenic 
episodes: Siderian (Santa Maria Chico Granulitic Complex, 
2.37 to 2.35 Ga), Rhyacian (Encantadas, Vigia and Arroio dos 
Ratos complexes, 2.2. to 2.1 Ga), and less abundant Statherian 
rocks (Seival Metagranite, 1.78 to 1.75 Ga) (Camozzato 
et al. 2012, 2013, Philipp et al. 2013, 2016c). These units 
have been intruded by Calymmian (1.57 to 1.55 Ga) anoro-
genic basic rocks, represented in the Tijucas Terrane by the 
Tupi Silveira Amphibolite and in the Pelotas Batholith by 
the Capivarita Anorthosite (Camozzato et al. 2012, 2013, 
Chemale Jr. et al. 2011).

Closure of the Charrua Ocean
The construction of the Neoproterozoic DFB starts 

with the closure of the Charrua Ocean during the Passinho 
and São Gabriel orogenies and later with the collision 
between the arc systems and the western margin of the 
Nico Perez Microplate. The final stages of evolution of the 
Brasiliano orogenic cycle are marked by the closure of the 
Adamastor Ocean during the Dom Feliciano orogeny. 
This orogenesis is characterized by the emplacement of 
voluminous syn-collisional high-K calc-alkaline granites 
of metaluminous to peraluminous character, associated 
with high-grade metamorphism coeval with the colli-
sion between the Rio de La Plata and Kalahari cratons. 
The collapse of the Dom Feliciano Belt is defined by 
important late- to post-orogenic granitic magmatism of 
high-K calc-alkaline to alkaline affinity. This is accom-
panied by the deposition of the four sedimentary suc-
cessions of the Camaquã Basin, the last three associated 
with intense volcanic activity.

During the last two decades, arc-related Neoproterozoic plu-
tonic complexes and volcano-sedimentary sequences have been 
recognized in Goiás and Rio Grande do Sul. These important 
subduction-related juvenile crustal accretions took place during 
the Tonian (Leite et al. 1998, Saalmann et al. 2010, Philipp 
et al. 2014). These associations suggest that the duration of the 
Brasiliano orogeny and ocean plate subduction was substan-
tially longer than what has been suggested in previous models. 
They demonstrate the existence of small ocean basins separat-
ing continental microplates, which were later amalgamated. 

The new geochronological and isotopic data indicate 
that subduction between 900 and 700 Ma marked the ini-
tial stages of the Neoproterozoic orogenic events in south-
ern Brazil (e.g. Hartmann et al. 2011). The rock units which 
represent this period of oceanic lithosphere consumption are 
exposed only in the São Gabriel Terrane. Opening of the 
oceanic basin between the RLPC and Nico Perez Microplate 
started at least 0.95 – 0.9 Ga ago (Saalmann et al. 2005, 2006, 
Arena &amp;amp; Hartmann, 2015) (Fig. 11). Subduction of oceanic

Tectonic evolution of the Dom Feliciano Belt



lithosphere started at about 900 to 860 Ma leading to the 
development of the Passinho Arc, an intraoceanic island arc 
above an east-dipping subduction zone (e.g.:Philipp et al. 
2014, Lusa et al. 2016). Eastward subduction beneath the 
Nico Perez Microplate resulted in the establishment of the 
São Gabriel Arc, with active continental margin magmatism 
with main activity between 780 and 700 Ma (Saalmann et al. 
2010, Hartmann et al. 2011 and references therein). 

Dextral oblique collision of the arc systems and accretion to 
the west passive margin of the Nico Perez Microplate occurred 
between ca. 710 and 700 Ma (Remus et al. 1999). The colapse 
of the orogen is defined by the formation of a late-orogenic 
basin represented by the metasediments of the Pontas do Salso 
Complex, with a maximum age of ca. 680 Ma (Vedana et al. 2016). 

Closure of the Adamastor Ocean
The Porongos Complex (PC) formed along the east-

ern passive margin of the Nico Perez Microplate. The geo-
cronological data suggest Paleoproterozoic sources within 
the Nico Perez and Archean sources from Rio de La Plata, 
Congo and Kalahari cratons for sediments of this part of 
the complex. Mesoproterozoic zircon grains may have been 
derived from the Andean basement situated in the central 
part of Argentina or, alternatively, from southern Africa 
(Hartmann et al. 2004, Gruber et al. 2011, Pertile et al. 
2015a,b). The field data associated with the provenance 
data suggest that the Porongos basin originated as an east 
passive margin basin of the Nico Perez Microplate. On the 
other hand, the geochemical and U-Pb ages of metavolca-
nic rocks of the PC suggest that they formed in a continen-
tal magmatic arc. These data are supported by the age of 
Piratini Gneisses (Silva et al. 1997) and by the new data of 
Koester et al. (2016). The Lu-Hf data presented by Pertille 
et al. (2015b) indicate that the Porongos metavolcanic rocks 
derived from an old crustal source aged between 2.4 and 
2.2 Ga, and could not be correlated with the São Gabriel 
Arc metavolcanics. The metavolcanic rocks of the Bossoroca 
Complex display positive ?Hf (+8 to +12) and source age of 
0.9 to 1.0 Ga (unpublished data). 

The volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Porongos Complex 
exposed in the Cachoeira do Sul area display features which 
are different from those of the Santana da Boa Vista region, 
since they show Neoproterozoic provenance and geochemical 
characteristics which are indicative of magmatic arc sources 
(Saalmann et al. 2006, Pertile et al. 2015a,b). The data might 
suggest the existence of a younger foreland basin.

Two granite groups have been identified within the 
Porongos Complex:
1. calc-alkaline muscovite- and tourmaline-bearing peralu-

minous granites, and
2. alkaline and peralkaline intrusions with aegirine and biotite.

Granites of the first group are coeval with collisional meta-
morphism, and the younger are late-orogenic and associated 
with late-stage movements of the high-angle shear zones in 
the northern (Cachoeira do Sul) and southern (Candiota) 
areas of the Tijucas Terrane (Camozzato et al. 2012, 2013). 

The deformation prograded to the east, being recorded in 
left-lateral ductile shear zones along the Dorsal de Canguçu Shear 
Zone which was active between 650 and 620 Ma (e.g.: Fernandes 
et al. 1992; Philipp et al. 2003, 2013, 2016a). The sialic base-
ment of this region, represented by orthogneisses of the ARC 
and paragneisses of the VCC, have been strongly deformed and 
metamorphosed under medium- to high-grade and intermediate 
pressure conditions. As a result of the oblique collision, the Dorsal 
de Canguçu Shear Zone formed, which caused partial melting 
in the mantle or lower crustal depths. While this shear zone was 
active, large volumes of granitic magmas formed, including, for 
example, the 650 Ma old Quitéria Granite (Koester et al. 2001b), 
as well as a smaller volume of mafic magmas. 

The second and most important collisional event was the 
oblique collision between the RLPC/Nico Perez Microplate 
and Kalahari Craton between 650 and 620 Ma (Chemale Jr. 
et al. 2011, Gregory et al. 2015, Philipp et al. 2016a). The dis-
placement of the basement terrains along the NE-SW trans-
current shear zones was also responsible for generating space 
for the emplacement of the granitic suites. The anatexis asso-
ciated to the late stage of collisional process generated large 
volumes of high-K calc-alkaline granitic magmas and resulted 
in the formation of the Pelotas Batholith and associated mafic 
and felsic magmatism of the Camaquã Basin (Philipp et al. 
2013, 2016a). This magmatism started with the development 
of the Dorsal do Canguçu Shear Zone and emplacement of 
the Quitéria granite. This event took place during or right after 
the peak of collisional metamorphism generating anatexis of 
the pelitic gneisses of the VCC and of the orthogneisses of the 
ARC. Pseudosection studies suggest temperatures between 740 
and 820°C and pressures of  9 to 10 kbar (Philipp et al. 2013). 

The Cordilheira Suite formed during this event at ca. 650 
and 620 Ma (Philipp et al., 2013, 2016a). The collision generated 
large volumes of high-K calc-alkaline granites and resulted in the 
formation of the Pelotas Batholith. The Cordilheira and Arroio 
Francisquinho granites are the main bodies of the Cordilheira 
Suite and are emplaced along the the Dorsal de Canguçu Shear 
Zone. The increase in thermal gradient and ascent of the asthe-
nosphere at the base of the orogen may have contributed to 
extensive anatexis and generation of peraluminous granitoids. 

Following continental collision, between 600 and 570 Ma, 
the development and emplacement of the Pelotas Batholith 
took place in the lower crust associated with ductile trans-
current shear zones. Left-lateral shear also characterized 630 
– 550 Ma deformation in the Pelotas Batholith further to 
the east. Late-orogenic plutonic, volcanic and sedimentary

units of the Seival Association formed under transtensional 
to extensional environments between 590 and 500 Ma, 
resulting in the orogenetic collapse of the DFB.

CONCLUSIONS

The recent isotope data indicate that the the evolution of the 
DFB took place between 0.9 and 0.54 Ga. Three orogenic events 
known as the Passinho (0.9 – 0.86 Ga), São Gabriel (0.77 – 
0.68 Ga) and Dom Feliciano (0.65 – 0.54 Ga) are recognized.

The evolution of the São Gabriel Terrane is preserved in 
igneous zircon grains, indicating ages of 0.93 Ga to 0.9 for the 
opening of the Charrua Ocean and 0.9 to 0.7 Ga for the closure 
and generation of the intraoceanic Passinho Arc (0.9 – 0.86 
Ga) and the São Gabriel Arc (0.77 – 0.68 Ga). The collision 
of the arc systems against the Nico Perez Microplate occurred 
around 0.71 – 0.7 Ga, and the collapse of the SGT is marked 
by the deposition of the Pontas do Salso Complex at 680 Ma. 

The Tijucas Terrane is composed of the Paleoproterozoic 
orthogneiss domes of Santana da Boa and Vigia (Siderian 
and Rhyacian) and of Neoproterozoic metavolcano-sedimen-
tary rocks (Cryogenian). The Taquarembó Terrane present 

the largest area of Paleoproterozoic orthogneisses (Siderian), 
intruded by granites and covered by Neoproterozoic sedi-
mentary and volcanic rocks. 

All units of the Dom Feliciano Belt were mapped on a 
regional scale and the inclusion of this database with the current 
set of geochronological and isotopic data has provided significant 
advances in the understanding of its units and the correlation 
of the processes with other orogenic belts of Brazil and Africa.
