resumo 
 

 

  Actualmente, os nanomaterias são utilizados extensivamente. As suas 
aplicações incluem a electrónica, consumíveis (p.e. cosméticos), medicina, 
remediação ambiental e catalisadores. Apesar  do aumento na utilização de 
nanomaterias e consequente despejo no ambiente, os seus efeitos e 
comportamento são ainda potencialmente desconhecidos. A informação 
actualmente disponível diz respeito principalmente aos seus efeitos para a 
saúde humana. Comparativamente, tem sido desenvolvido pouco trabalho 
acerca do efeito nos sistemas ecológicos, especialmente na avaliação de risco 
em ecossistemas terrestres, existindo portanto uma necessidade de preencher 
esta lacuna. De entre as espécies de solo usadas em ecotoxicologia estão os 
Enquitraídeos (Oligochaeta), membros importantes da fauna do solo, que 
contribuem para a melhoria da sua estrutura porosa, e indirectamente na 
degradação da matéria orgânica. Além do facto de existir um protocolo padrão 
para testar efeitos ao nível da reprodução e sobrevivência (ISO, 2005), 
recentemente a utilização de ferramentas que estudam efeitos ao nível sub-
celular (Howcroft et al., 2008) e dos genes (Amorim et al., 2009) foi optimizada 
e está disponível, sendo uma vantagem competitiva em relação a outras 
espécies padrão. O principal objectivo deste estudo foi comparar os efeitos de 
nanopartículas de cobre com um sal de cobre (CuCl2), em Enchytaeus albidus, 
utilizando a análise da expressão genética, e de biomarcadores de stress e 
neuronais como parâmetro. Os resultados mostraram que a exposição, tanto a 
nanopartículas de cobre como aos sais de cobre, causou alterações 
significativas nos biomarcadores e no perfil de expressão genética. A análise 
dos biomarcadores mostrou a ocorrência de danos oxidativos, causados por 
ambas as formas de cobre (aos 8 dias de exposição), e resposta anti-oxidante 
(GPx, GSH e GSSG) aos 4 dias. Também foi observado um efeito dependente 
do tempo e da concentração testada entre os tratamentos. No entanto, não 
houve um biomarcador que permitisse discriminar entre tratamentos. Da 
análise dos efeitos ao nível dos genes foi possível observar expressão 
diferencial dos genes devido ao cobre (nano e sal). As principais funções 
afectadas verificaram-se nos genes relacionados com a transcrição e tradução, 
metabolismo energético e proteico, e resposta imunológica e de stress. Devido 
ao número reduzido de homologias com funções conhecidas, é difícil fornecer 
explicações mais detalhadas. 
Dos resultados de ambas as ferramentas utilizadas não existe uma evidência 
forte de que uma das duas formas de cobre seja mais tóxica que a outra, no 
entanto, parecem indicar que os dois compostos têm modos de acção 
diferentes.

abstract 

 
Nanomaterials are widely used nowadays. Current applications include 
electronics, consumer products (e.g. cosmetics), medicine, environmental 
remediation and catalysts. Despite the increased use of nanomaterials, and 
consequent disposal in the environment, their behavior and effects  are largely 
unknown. The current available information is mainly focused on the effetc on 
human health. Comparatively, little work has been done on ecological systems, 
especially in the assesment of the environmental risk to terrestrial ecossystems 
and there is a need to fill this gap. Among soil species used in ecotoxicology 
are the Enchytraeids (Oligochaeta), important members of the soil fauna, 
contributing to the improvement of the pore structure of the soil and, indirectly, 
to the degradation of the organic matter. Besides the fact that there is a 
standard guideline for testing effects at the survival and reproduction level 
(ISO, 2005), recently, the use of tools that study the effect at the subcelular 
(Howcroft et al, 2008) and gene level (Amorim et al, 2009) have been optimized 
and became available, being a competitive advantage in comparison to other 
standard species. The main goal of this research was to compare the effects of 
nanosized copper with Cu-salt (CuCl2), in Enchytareus albidus, using gene 
expression, and oxidative stress and neuronal biomarkers as endpoints. The 
results showed that exposure to nano-Cu and Cu-salt caused significative 
changes on the biomarkers and the gene expression profile. Biomarkers 
analysis indicate oxidative damage caused by both forms of copper (at 8 days 
of exposure), and an anti-oxidative response (GPx, GSH and GSSG) at 4 days. 
There was also a time and concentration dependent effect between the 
treatments. Nevertheless, there was not one biomarker that provided the best 
discrimination. The analysis of effects at gene level showed differently 
expressed genes due to copper (nano or salt). Main functions affected were in 
transcription and translation, energy and protein metabolism and immune and 
stress response related genes. Due to the reduced number of homologies to 
known functions further explanations are difficult.  
From results of both tools used there was no strong evidence of that one of the 
forms is significantly more toxic than the other, nevertheless these compounds 
seem to have different modes of action.

Investigation is needed about the behaviour of NMs in natural matrices (soil, air, 

freshwater (FW) and seawater (SW)). Also, the large variety of nanoproducts, and 

lack of knowledge on adverse effects on a wide variety of wildlife, adds uncertainty 

about what products to prioritise for risk assess first; and whether or not the 

concept of protecting ‘‘most of the organisms most of the time’’ is achievable in the 

immediate future (Handy et al. 2008).                                                                    30

General Introduction 
 
1.  Introduction – Ecotoxicology and the use of molecular sciences 
 
The term ecotoxicology was firstly used by Truhaunt, in 1969, as “the study of 

adverse effects of chemicals with the aim of protecting natural species and 

populations” (Twardowska 2004). This young branch of science has started to play 

a crucial role in providing the key knowledge of sustainability (Twardowska 2004). 

Since the beginning, ecotoxicology was recognized as an interdisciplinary science, 

integrating concepts of ecology, chemistry, biology, pharmacology, biochemistry 

and other disciplines. Nowadays, the main goal is not only the study of the effects, 

but also the understanding of how chemical stressors might affect organisms at 

individual, population and ecosystem levels (Hermens et al. 2004). This task 

becomes complicated by the fact that chemicals do not act in isolation but interact 

with non-chemical stressors (e.g. UV radiation, changes in temperature and CO2 

concentrations, pathogens, etc.) (Eggen et al. 2004; Hermens et al. 2004). Some 

decades of environmental management have reduced the concentrations of many 

well-known pollutants. The most recent challenges in ecotoxicology are related  to: 

low concentrations of pollutants and long exposure periods (chronic effects), 

multiple effects induced by single compounds, complex mixtures of pollutants, 

multiple stressors (interaction between chemical and non-chemical stressors), and 

ecosystem complexity (Eggen et al. 2004). To deal with these challenges, a key 

element is a focus on a mechanistic understanding of toxic effects as well as 

interactions among stressors at multiple biological levels of organization (Eggen et 

al. 2004; Hermens et al. 2004). In this field, molecular approaches can provide a 

better understanding of underlying processes of ecotoxicology, necessary for this 

mechanism-based assessment of the risk and effects of stressors (Eggen et al. 

2004).  

 

During the past two decades, considerable efforts have been dedicated to develop 

and applying biomarkers for use in ecotoxicology and ecological risk assessment 

(Forbes et al. 2006). These efforts have resulted in part for the need of early 

warning indicators that respond before measurable effects on individuals and 



 

 4

populations occur (effects studied in traditional endpoints such as the impairment 

on growth, survival and reproduction) and in part as an aid to identifying the 

causes of effects observed at population and community level (Forbes et al. 2006). 

According to De Coen and co-authors (2000), biomarkers can be considered as 

measures of  the initial changes (effects) caused by the interactions between the 

stressor and the (biological) receptor site. This interaction induces cascades of 

events starting at the sub-cellular level (e.g. disturbance of gene transcription, 

interference with metabolic pathways) and ultimately leads to adverse effects at 

higher level of biological organization. On the other hand, and despite biomarkers 

have higher sensitivity and specificity at molecular and cytological levels, 

physiological impairment are potentially the most effective markers for assessing 

pollution as they can serve as precursors to effects in populations or communities, 

and so, ecologically relevant (Nicholson and Lam 2005). As the targets of 

protection in ecological risk assessment most often are populations, communities 

and ecosystems, suites of biomarkers at different functional complexity (e.g. 

molecular, cytological) coupled with measures of higher levels of biological 

organization are recommended in monitoring programmes, and the biomarker 

response must be consistently linked to responses at these higher levels. 

Because, even if biomarkers were not able to provide reliable predictions of effects 

at higher levels of biological organization, they may reveal the mechanisms 

underlying these effects (Forbes et al. 2006). Thus, to provide both an early 

warning of pollution impacts and environmental relevance, measures of 

bioindicators (growth or reproductive output or energy utilization) should be 

associated with the molecular biomarker response (Depledge and Fossi 1994) 

 

2. Test organism 
 

For an adequate risk assessment, the appropriate selection of the test species is 

crucial. To be considered as a potential indicator organism for the assessment of 

soil quality, organisms should fulfil several criteria such as: play a key role in the 

functioning of the soil ecosystem, so that their response is relevant for conclusions 

on the system level; be present in a wide range of ecosystems, to allow 



 

 5

comparisons between systems; occur abundantly, so that they are widely available 

and their response is readily recordable; be easy to use both in field and 

laboratory conditions: they should be easily collectable and maintained in culture; 

come into contact with a variety of stress factors, via the soil solution, the solid 

phase, and the gaseous phase in soil; and be sufficiently sensitive to a wide range 

of environmental stresses but not so sensitive that they easily become extinct 

(Didden and Rombke 2001). Enchytraeids readily fulfill the first five of these 

criteria, thus they are useful as ecotoxicological test organisms (Didden and 

Rombke 2001; Rombke 2003). 

Enchytraeids (Enchytraeidae) have been used in ecotoxicological laboratory tests 

for more than 30 years (Rombke and Moser 2002). The enchytraeids belong to the 

saprophagous mesofauna of the litter layer and the upper mineral soil. Through 

their feeding activity the soil assumes a fine-grained “crumb” structure with an 

often higher stability than that of the bulk soil. Their digging activity (despite more 

limited compared to most earthworms) may improve the small-scale water and air 

management of soil, especially when population levels are high (Jänsch et al., 

2005). The family Enchytraeidae belongs to the order Oligochaeta (class Clitellata, 

phylum Annelida). There is about 200-300 species in Central Europe and 900 in 

worldwide (Jansch et al. 2005). In general, enchytraeids are small worms (1-40 

mm), whitish, that reproduce sexually (but asexual fragmentation is also possible). 

They feed on decomposed plant residues and microorganisms. The pH of soil, the 

content of organic matter and the soil moisture are factors that influence their 

occurrence as well as their reaction to stress factors (Rombke and Moser 2002). 

Enchytraeus albidus is one of the biggest and well-known specie of the genus and. 

It is acidophobe (optimum pH between 6.8 to 7.0), likes a range of temperature 

between 15 to 20ºC, prefers 55 to 65% of dry mass (but is able to reproduce in 

soils with moisture content as high as 90%), and the reproduction is inhibit when 

the organic matter content is below 3% (Jansch et al. 2005). World-wide it occurs 

at places with a large amount of organic material, but can also be found at many 

soil types. Individuals of E. albidus reproduce quickly, can be kept in various 

substrates and feed with different foods (Rombke and Moser 2002), that make 

them so easy to keep in culture.

3. Test chemicals: copper (salt and nanosized form) 
 

Copper (Cu) is a trace metal, classified as an essential element for most living 

organism, since trace amounts of copper serve essential biological functions, 

including respiration and oxidative stress protection by cytochrome oxidase and 

Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase, respectively (Yasokawa et al. 2008). Nevertheless, 

in high concentrations it can be a very toxic pollutant, including for Enchytraieds 

(Amorim et al. 2008; Amorim et al. 2005; Maraldo et al. 2006) and earthworms 

(Scott-Fordsmand et al. 2000). Copper is sometimes detected in soil and water as 

a heavy metal pollutant close of mines and industrial areas, for e.g., at Hygum site 

in Denmark, soil copper concentration can reach up to 3,400 mg/Kg due to timber 

preservation with CuSO4 (Maraldo et al. 2006).  

Through the Haber-Weiss reaction, copper ions can catalyze the conversion of 

hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to the powerful oxidant hydroxyl radical (OH?), causing 

oxidative damage to lipids, DNA and proteins (Bremner 1998).   

The recent investigation performed in –omics area allowed the unravel of 

molecular mechanisms underling copper toxicity (Bundy et al. 2008). Sublethal 

concentrations of copper caused mitochondrial dysfunction. As a result of this, the 

amount of energy available from oxidative phosphorylation is reduced resulting in 

a switch to metabolism of stored carbohydrates. Also, mitochondrial dysfunction 

leads to an increase in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In higher 

levels o biological organization, the reduction in body weight was observed (Bundy 

et al. 2008). Also, genes coding for proteins involved in general response to 

metals, as metallothioneins and heat shock proteins were also found up-regulated 

in response to copper exposure (Bundy et al. 2008; Muller et al. 2007).  

All these studies were performed with copper in its soluble form. Until the moment, 

very little is known about copper nanoparticles and their effects in the 

environment. An overview of the work performed in –nano field is given in the next 

chapter, including the work done with nano-copper.

4. Objectives 

The main aim of this work was to compare the effects of copper nanoparticles with 

copper salt (CuCl2) on Enchytraeus albidus using two different approaches: 

response of stress and neuro-muscular biomarkers, and gene expression analysis. 

Therefore, the present thesis is organized in two main chapters (papers) and 

general conclusion: 

? Chapter 1: Introduction to ecotoxicology and use of molecular techniques 

in this science, test species, test chemicals and objectives of the thesis. 

? Chapter 2: Review about the state of the art of the ecotoxicology of 

nanomaterials. 

? Chapter 3: “Cu-Nanoparticles versus Cu-salt: analysis of stress and 

neuro-muscular biomarkers response in Enchytraeus albidus 

(Oligochaeta)” (Gomes, S.I.L., Novais, S., Gravato, C., Amorim, M.J.B., 

Guilhermino, L., Soares, A.M.V.M. &amp;amp; Scott-Fordsmand, J.J., in prep.) 

? Chapter 4: “Effects of nanoparticles in Enchytraeus albidus (Oligochaeta): 

differential gene expression through microarray analysis” (Gomes, S.I.L, 

Novais, S., Amorim, M.J.B., Scott-Fordsmand, J.J., De Coen, W. &amp;amp;

State of the art: ecotoxicology of nanomaterials 
 

1. Nanotechnology 
 

Despite their increasing utilization, few formal definitions of nanoparticles have 

been published. The most often used is the definition of nanotechnology. For 

example, The Royal Society &amp;amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering (The Royal 

Society &amp;amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering 2004) defines nanotechnology as 

“the design characterization, production and application of structures, devices and 

systems by controlling shape and size at the nanometer scale”. The Interagency 

Subcommittee on Nanoscale Science, Engineering and Technology (NEST) has 

proposed a similar definition: “Nanotecnhology is the creation and the use of 

materials, devices and systems through the control of matter on the nanometer-

length scale at the level of atoms, molecules and supramolecular structures” 

(Report of the National Nanotechnology Initiative Workshop 2003). Currently, 

nanomaterials (NMs) are defined as materials with a size range between 1 and 

100 nm, in at least one dimension (Fig 1). More recently, a good working definition 

of nanomaterials mentions not only their size range but also their exhibition of 

novel properties (Borm et al. 2006; Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution 

2008).  



 

 14

 Figure 1: Length scale showing the nanometer in context (The Royal Society &amp;amp; 

The Royal Academy of Engineering 2004). 

 

Nanomaterials can have one, two or three dimensions in the nanoscale. Materials 

having only one dimension in the nanoscale are layers such as surface coatings 

and thin films. Those which are nanoscaled in two dimensions include nanowires 

and nanotubes. And those which are nanoscaled in three dimensions are usually 

known as nanoparticles (NPs) and include colloids, quantum dots and 

nanocrystalline materials (Fig. 2) (The Royal Society &amp;amp; The Royal Academy of 

Engineering,(The Royal Society &amp;amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering 2004); 

Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, (Royal Commission on 

Environmental Pollution 2008).

Figure 2: Tridimensional representation of C60 Buckminsterfullerene (also known 

as fullerene). It is a spherical molecule, with 1 nm of diameter, which comprises 60 

carbon atoms arranged as the corners of 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons. It is 

perhaps the best known NP.  

http://www.3dchem.com/moremolecules.asp?ID=217&amp;amp;othername=Buckminsterfullerene   

 
 
2. Applications of nanomaterials 
 
Nanomaterials are widely used in skin care products (titanium dioxide, iron oxide 

and other metal oxides); in structural applications such as coatings (titanium 

dioxide), catalysts and ceramics (silicon nitride and silicon carbide); in electronics 

(single walled nanotubes and metal oxides); in biotechnology on targeted drug 

delivery and biosensors; and in environmental remediation (Royal Comission on 

Environmental Pollution 2008; The Royal Society &amp;amp; The Royal Academy of 

Engineering 2004). At present, more than 800 nanotechnology-based consumer 

products are available in the market (Fig. 3) and the most common NMs used in 

consumer products are silver, carbon (which include fullerens), zinc (including zinc 

oxide), silica, titanium (including titanium dioxide) and gold (The Project on 

Emerging Technologies, 2009).

Figure 3: Number of consumer products, available in March 2008, containing 

nanomaterials. The products are grouped in categories (Health and Fitness, Home 

and Garden, Electronics and Computers, Food and Beverage, Cross Cutting, 

Automotive, Appliances and Goods for Children).  

http://www.nanotechproject.org/inventories/consumer/analysis_draft/  

 

Despite copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) not being included in the most commonly 

used NMs (Fig. 4), they are being given considerable attention due to their 

interesting properties (e.g. high electrical and thermal conductivities) and potential 

applications in many areas of industry. Nowadays, metallic Cu NPs are used in 

modern electronic circuits (e.g. chip-package interconnections (Tummala et al. 

2006) and conductive inks for printing electronic components (Lee et al. 2008b)), 

metallurgy, catalysis (Dhas et al. 1998; Samim et al. 2007) and sensors 

(Athanassiou et al. 2006).  



 

 17

  

Figure 4: TEM micrograph of copper nanoparticles at two different magnifications: 

(a) bar = 300 nm, (b) bar = 40 nm (Dhas et al., 2008). 

 

It is believed that NMs utilization will dramatically increase in the next few years  

(The Royal Society &amp;amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering 2004). Such increase in 

utilization will probably result in the entry of nonmaterial’s wastes in the 

environment, which is scientist’s main concern, because their effects and 

environmental behavior are largely unknown. In this context it appears the 

definition of Nanotoxicology as “the science of engineered nanodevices and 

nanostructures that deals with their effects in living organisms” (Oberdorster et al. 

2005). 

 
3. Novel properties and entry in the environment 
 

Their small size and consequent larger surface area confer specific properties to 

nanomaterials. Increasing of surface reactivity predicts that NMs will exhibit 

greater biological activity per given mass comparatively to the respective bulk 

materials and that the interaction of nanoparticles with cells and their structures 

are likely to be very different from those of larger-sized particles (Oberdorster et al. 

2005). With a reduction in size, several properties can be dramatically changed, 

for e.g. electrical conductivity, magnetic characteristics, hardness and, as 

mentioned above, active surface area, chemical reactivity and biological activity  

(Nel et al. 2006). The surface charge is an other characteristic that can change at 

the nanoscale. It is important because it determines the solubility and aggregation 

of nanomaterials which are key factors in determination of their fate and behavior 

in the environment (Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution 2008). These

properties have been explored for the different uses of nanomaterials, but can also 

become unwanted because of the possibility of causing toxic effects  

Manufactured nanomaterials can reach the environment trough intentional 

releases (e.g. use of nanoparticles to remediate contaminated soil) as well as 

unintentional releases such as production facilities effluents and atmospheric 

emissions (Klaine et al. 2008; Oberdorster et al. 2005). Humans’ uptake of 

nanoparticles can follow three main routes: inhalation (respiratory tract), ingestion 

(digestive tract) and dermal absorption (skin) (Oberdorster et al. 2005). Their 

uptake by organisms in the environment depends on a variety of processes that 

modify nanomaterials properties (e.g. aggregation, morphology and degradation)  

(Klaine et al. 2008; Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution 2008). Also, the 

different environmental matrices, such as air, soil/sediments, freshwater and 

seawater are very complex, leading to an increased difficulty in predicting NMs 

behaviour and toxicity (Handy et al. 2008). In figure 5 the routes of exposure, 

uptake, distribution and degradation of NMs in the environment are summarized.  

 

 

Figure 5: Routes of exposure, uptake, distribution, and degradation of NPs in the 

environment. Solid lines indicate routes that have been demonstrated in the 

laboratory or field or that are currently in use (remediation). Magenta lettering 

indicates possible degradation routes, and blue lettering indicates possible sinks 

and sources of NPs (Oberdorster et al. 2005).

4. Ecotoxicology of nanomaterials: state of the art 
 
So far, most of the nanotoxicology studies are focused on human health (e.g. 

(Handy and Shaw 2007; Kreyling et al. 2006; Lewinski et al. 2008), especially on 

the effects of nanoparticles to respiratory system (e.g. (Borm and Kreyling 2004; 

Donaldson). Among the few published ecotoxicological studies with NMs or NPs, 

nearly all of these have been performed in organisms from the aquatic 

compartment, such as daphnids, zebrafish and algae. These studies refer to acute 

and chronic effects of several nanoparticles e.g. fullerenes (Lovern and Klaper 

2006; Lovern et al. 2007; Oberdorster 2004; Zhu et al. 2006), TiO2 and other metal 

oxides (Heinlaan et al. 2008; Hund-Rinke and Simon 2006; Lovern and Klaper 

2006; Lovern et al. 2007; Velzeboer et al. 2008). In table 1 we present a brief 

review on ecotoxicology studies made with nanoparticles, after which a brief 

explanation is given with more details.

The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell internalization are 

reported as causes of citotoxicity of NPs (Lewinski et al. 2008). Some 

ecotoxicological studies reported the induction of oxidative stress after exposure to 

fullerenes (Oberdorster 2004; Zhu et al. 2006; Zhu et al. 2008), TiO2 (Federici et 

al. 2007) and carbon black NPs in fish species (Canesi et al. 2008). In the study 

performed by Zhu and co-authors (2008) the levels of both SOD and CAT 

activities (the primary defense against ROS) were significantly induced in the liver 



 

 26

of juvenile carp for all the concentrations of C60 tested (0.04, 0.2 and 1 mg/L). In 

gill and brain tissues, the other organs tested, only CAT was induced, suggesting 

that the liver is the target or the most susceptible organ to the C60 exposure. 

However, studies performed with different nanoparticles and different test species 

(TiO2 in rainbow trout and Cu in zebra fish) reported the gill as the primary organ 

affected by NPs exposure (Federici et al. 2007; Griffitt et al. 2007). In a study with 

blue mussels’ hemocytes (Canesi et al. 2008) it was showed that carbon black 

NPs (NCB) entered into hemocytes in a dose-dependent way, and caused 

oxidative stress to the cells (stimulating the release of lysossomal hydrolytic 

enzymes, oxidative burst and nitric oxide production) and inflammatory response 

(mediated by activation of stress-activated MAPK members). This is the only 

ecotoxicological study that simultaneously reports cell internalization and oxidative 

damage after NMs exposure. However, investigation is needed to allow the 

correlation between the modulation of antioxidant enzymes and physiological 

responses (e.g. survival, growth and reproduction). 

Some other studies reported the assimilation and/or bioaccumulation of NMs by 

exposed organisms. Kashiwada (2006) results showed that fluorescent 

polystyrene microspheres were visible in exposed eggs of medaka, and persist in 

the larvae spawned from exposed eggs. The accumulation was size dependent 

and higher for particles with 474 nm (when testing sizes of 39.4, 474, 932, 18600 

and 42000 nm).  An other study performed by Asharani and co-authors (2008) 

showed that silver (Ag) NPs (capped with BSA or starch), with a size ranging 

between 5-20 nm, entered in the chorion of zebrafish embryos and were toxic in a 

dose-dependent way. Ag NPs exposure also caused a decrease in heart rate and 

hatching as well as severe malformations. Cheng and co-authors (2007) have 

studied the effects of carbon nanotubes in zebrafish embryos. According to their 

results no effects on mortality or embryonic development occurred, whereas a 

hatching delay was observed. They also showed that chorion forms a barrier 

protecting zebrafish embryos from the aggregates of single-walled carbon 

nanotubes (in the range of 10 µm
2
) which were to large to enter the chorion. 

Also in aquatic ecotoxicology, the toxicity of NMs has been related to their action 

as vectors for the transport of other chemicals. Zhang and co-authors (2007) 



 

 27

results showed that TiO2 NPs adsorb to cadmium (Cd) increasing its accumulation 

in carp. Nano-TiO2 facilitated the transport of Cd ions in a positive correlation 

between Cd and TiO2 concentrations. As showed by Baun and co-authors (2008) 

C60 easily adsorb to phenanthrene (85%) while only 10% of atrazine, methyl-

parathion and pentachlorophenol adsorb to C60. The toxicity of phenanthrene to 

algae was increased following sorption to C60 aggregates, but decreased in 

daphnids. The toxicity of pentachlorophenol decreases in both organisms tested 

with the addition of C60. This study shows that the interaction between NMs/NPs 

and other chemicals, which will eventually occur in natural environments, should 

be taken into account in the nano-ecotoxicology research. 

The effects of C60 at lethal and sublethal levels are relatively well studied in 

bacteria. Thong and co-authors (2007) results showed that the introduction of C60 

has no significant impact in soil microbial communities. No significant differences 

could be observed between controls and treated samples in terms of soil 

respiration, microbial biomass and soil enzymatic activities. Johansen and co-

authors (2008) results showed that 0.5, 25 or 50 mg/Kg of soil of C60 only inhibit 

the growth of fast-growing bacteria, which have recovered until the end of 

exposure (23 days).  Studies on microbial effects have also been performed in 

water with C60 (Fortner et al. 2005). Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria 

were exposed to 0,04mg/L and 4mg/L of C60:  no effect on bacterial growth was 

observed at the smaller concentration of C60 and there was a complete inhibition of 

growth in the highest concentration. These studies indicate that different exposure 

media (water or soil) have an important role in ecotoxicity of NPs. Lyon and co-

authors (2006) have studied the effects of C60 water suspensions, on Bacillus 

subtilis, prepared by four different methods. Their results showed that despite all 

the suspensions possessed antibacterial activity, some of them were more potent 

than others, which is in accordance with other studies showing that different 

methods of NMs/NPs preparation could lead to differences in toxicity (Lovern and 

Klaper 2006; Zhu et al. 2006). 

Heinlaan and co-authors (2008) performed a study comparing the effects of 

several sizes (bulk, nano and ionic) of different particles (CuO, ZnO and TiO2) to 

the bacteria Vibrio fischeri and the crustaceans Thamnocephalus platyurus and D. 



 

 28

magna. Their results showed that there were no pronounced differences between 

the tree forms of Zn and TiO2 was not toxic. In the Cu group, different forms of the 

material caused different effects (to e.g. V. fischeri EC50 of 1.6 mg/L to CuSO4, 76 

mg/L to nano CuO and 3811 mg/L to CuO).  

Some studies were focused on nanosized copper. Results from Griffit and co-

authors (2007) showed that the gill was the primary target and no evidence for 

damage to other organs was observed. Exposure to nanocopper caused inhibition 

of Na
+
/K

+
 ATPase activity and a slight increase of plasma urea nitrogen (BUN) 

levels. Acute toxicity evaluation results showed that copper sulfate (soluble 

copper) was more toxic than nanocopper with a 48h EC50 of 0,25 mg Cu/L. 

Microarray results showed that 48h exposure to sub lethal concentrations of 

nanocopper resulted in 82 genes significantly differently expressed and that the 

transcriptional response induced by nanocopper was divergent from the one that 

was generated by the soluble copper, which means that the effects caused by 

nanocopper are not only due to solubility. The only knew study about the toxicity of 

copper NPs to terrestrial organisms was performed in plants (Phaseolus radiatus 

and Triticum aestivum), but in agar media instead of soil, by Lee and co-authors 

(2008a). Their results showed that exposure to Cu NPs caused a reduction in 

seedling growth of both test species, although P. radiatus was more sensitive with 

an EC50 value of 335 mg/L compared to 570 mg/L of T. aestivum. Bioaccumulation 

of nano Cu was observed in both plants (in the cytoplasm and cell wall of the root 

cells) and it was concentration dependent. To ensure that the toxic effect caused 

was the result of Cu NPs and not due to their solubility, the amount of cupric ions 

released during the preparation of Cu NPs was measured. The results showed 

that 1 mg/L of Cu nanoparticles released 0.3 mg/L of cupric ions, which was 

subsequently proved as non toxic to the test plants.   

Despite the fact of not being mentioned in the table above, because they are about 

toxicology (to humans) and not ecotoxicology, there are some interesting studies 

reporting the effects of nano-Cu. Chen and co-authors (2006) and Meng and co-

authors (2007) performed studies with mice. The results of the first study indicated 

that nanocopper (such as ion copper particles) is moderately toxic with 48h EC50 

of 414 mg/kg body weight and micro-copper is nearly non-toxic. Pathological 



 

 29

examinations revealed that kidney, liver and spleen are target organs for Cu NPs, 

suffering serious injuries also demonstrated by measurements of the blood 

biochemical indexes (BUN, Cr, TBA and ALP). Both studies explain the toxicity of 

nanocopper as a result of massive formation of copper ions, consumption of H
+
 

and formation of HCO
3-

. Nanocopper reacts with hydrogen ions of gastric juice 

resulting in formation of Cu ions and HCO
3-

 (leading to the alkanescence of the 

medium). The overload of copper ions causes damage on the hepatic cells and 

the alkanescence of the medium reduces the solubility of copper salts that is 

deposited in the kidney. An other study (Karlsson et al. 2008) compares the 

toxicity of several metal oxide nanoparticles (including CuO) and carbon 

nanotubes to human lung epithelial cells. Their results showed that between CuO, 

TiO2, ZnO, CuZnFe2O4, Fe2O3, Fe3O4, carbon and nanotubes nanoparticles, the 

nano CuO (which was not the smaller NP) was the one that caused more damage 

in all the parameters evaluated, which includes percentage of non-viable cells, 

oxidative DNA lesions, DNA damage and intracellular ROS. It was also compared 

the effect of CuO NPs and Cu ions (CuCl2) in the same cell line and the results 

showed that nano CuO was much more toxic than CuCl2. The most important 

finding in this study was the high toxicity and ability of nano CuO to cause DNA 

damage and oxidative stress, because Cu NPs are widely used in several 

industries and their toxicity has not been sufficiently investigated.  

 

5. Knowledge gaps and future perspectives 
 

In the current literature available, the reported effect concentrations are often very 

different, not only between laboratories using similar tests and organisms, but also 

depending on the method used to prepare the NMs for testing. On the other hand, 

based on the current understanding, the traditional methods used to assess the 

chemical toxicity are a good starting point for NMs/NPs testing. However new test 

strategies need to be delineated to lead with the novel toxicity mechanisms that 

can emerge from NMs/NPs (Nel et al. 2006). To adequately manage NMs in the 

environment, quantitative measures of both exposure and effects are needed. To 

enable the progression of the study about the NMs/NPs behavior, fate and effects 



 

 30

in the environment, Klaine and co-authors (Klaine et al. 2008) recommended the 

harmonization of several issues: 

. availability of standardized and characterized materials to researchers; 

. development of standardized methods to the creation of test media (both 

soil/sediment or water) for conducting fate and effects testing; 

. standardization of characterization requirements for particles and particle 

suspensions. 

That will give scientists the minimum information requirements to interpret their 

own and others results. Also needed is the development of high-sensitive 

techniques capable of the measurement of NMs in the environment (against a high 

background of naturally-occurring materials) to allow the testing of realistic 

exposure scenarios, including relevant test species (Royal Comission on 

Environmental Pollution 2008). Figure 6 schematizes the key challenges and 

knowledge gaps in the ecotoxicology of NMs that must be fulfilled to perform a 

correct environmental risk assessment and monitoring. 

 

Figure 6: Key challenges and knowledge gaps in the ecotoxicology of NPs and NMs. At 

this early stage, some uncertainty in data interpretation seems likely given the need for 

method development in both the ecotoxicology and chemistry. Investigation is needed 

about the behaviour of NMs in natural matrices (soil, air, freshwater (FW) and seawater 

(SW)). Also, the large variety of nanoproducts, and lack of knowledge on adverse effects 

on a wide variety of wildlife, adds uncertainty about what products to prioritise for risk 



 

 31

assess first; and whether or not the concept of protecting ‘‘most of the organisms most of 

the time’’ is achievable in the immediate future (Handy et al. 2008). 

 

Despite all the recent investigation performed in order to demonstrate the possible 

effects of NMs, the truth is that the largest fraction refers to the human concern. 

Although most people are concerned with effects on large wildlife (particularly the 

human being), the basis of many food chains depends on the benthic and soil flora 

and fauna, which could be dramatically affected by NMs release in the 

environment (Oberdorster et al. 2005). It is generally accepted that research is 

needed in water and soil ecosystems, but since the ultimate sink of NMs may be 

sediment and soil it is of outmost importance to study the effects on terrestrial 

environment and organisms (Klaine et al. 2008).

Abstract 
 

Nanotechnology is an emergent discipline with applications in science, technology 
and medicine. Despite the increased use of nanomaterials, their behaviour and 
effects in the environment are largely unknown. The information currently 
available is mostly focused on effects on human health and comparatively very 
little is known in ecological systems, terrestrial in particular. Enchytraeids 
(Oligochaeta) are important members of the soil fauna that indirectly contribute to 
the regulation and degradation of organic matter. These organisms are used in 
standard testing (ISO 2003) and the measurement of several biomarkers has 
currently been optimized for this species (Howcroft et al. 2009). In the present 
study, the main goal was to compare the effects of ionic copper versus copper 
nanoparticles in Enchytraeus albidus assessing the effect at the biomarker level, 
testing different concentrations and exposure time. Measured parameters were 
lipid peroxidation (LPO), total, reduced and oxidized glutathione content (TG, GSH 
and GSSG), the enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase 
(CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-
transferase (GST) and cholinesterases (ChEs). Results showed that both salt- 
and nano-copper caused oxidative stress and damage to E. albidus, and effects 
could be discriminated between the copper forms. Nevertheless and despite the 
visible discrimination between nano and the salt form (time and exposure 
dependent), there was not one or a set of biomarkers that provided the best 
discrimination.

1. Introduction 
 

Copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) are being given considerable attention due to their 

properties e.g. high electrical and thermic conductivities. Cu NPs are used in 

modern electronic circuits e.g. chip-package interconnections (Tummala et al. 

2006) and conductive inks for printing electronic components (Lee et al. 2008b), 

metallurgy, catalysis (Dhas et al. 1998; Samim et al. 2007) and sensors 

(Athanassiou et al. 2006)).  Increased use of nanomaterials will lead to their 

possible distribution in the environment, including the potential to contaminate soil, 

migrate into surface and groundwater, and interact with biota (Klaine et al. 2008). 

Despite the increased interest and recent investigation in this area, very little is 

known about the environmental effects and behaviour of nanoparticles especially 

for terrestrial ecosystems (Klaine et al. 2008). 

The available information about the ecotoxicology of nanoparticles includes mainly 

studies in organisms of the aquatic compartment (Fortner et al. 2005; Griffitt et al. 

2007; Heinlaan et al. 2008; Hund-Rinke and Simon 2006; Lovern and Klaper 2006; 

Lovern et al. 2007; Oberdorster 2004; Velzeboer et al. 2008; Zhu et al. 2006; Zhu 

et al. 2008), with very few studies on soil organisms (Johansen et al. 2008; Scott-

Fordsmand et al. 2008a; Scott-Fordsmand et al. 2008b; Tong et al. 2007; Lee et 

al. 2008a)).   

Despite the fact that copper is an essential element for most living organisms it is 

also well documented to cause toxicity in various organisms, including the 

enchytraeid E. albidus (Amorim et al. 2008; Amorim et al. 2005; Howcroft et al. 

2009). Copper is known to cause oxidative damage, catalysing the formation of 

hydroxyl radicals via the Haber-Weiss reaction (Bremner 1998): O2· - + Cu2+ ? 

O2 + Cu+ ; Cu+ + H2O2 ? Cu2+ + OH- + OH· . To protect organisms from 

oxidative stress there are antioxidant defences, present in all aerobic organisms, 

which include antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione 

peroxidases and glutathione reductase) and free radical scavengers (vitamins C 

and E, carotenoids, glutathione) whose function is to remove reactive oxygen 

species (ROS) (Doyotte et al. 1997). Enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants 

play a crucial role in maintaining cell homeostasis. Thus the balance between 



 

 41

prooxidant endogenous and exogenous factors and antioxidant defences in 

biological systems can be used to assess toxic effects under stressful 

environmental conditions (Howcroft et al. 2009). 

Comparatively, very little is known about the effects of copper nanoparticles. 

Studies reporting acute toxicity results comparing ionic copper with copper 

nanoparticles show that the first was more toxic to mice ( LD50 of 110 and 413 

mg/Kg respectively) (Chen et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2006; Meng et al. 2007) and 

zebrafish (EC50 of 0.25 mg/L and 1.6 mg/L respectively)(Griffitt et al. 2007). 

Microarray experiments (Griffitt et al. 2007) showed that 48h exposure to sub 

lethal concentrations of nanocopper resulted in 82 genes significantly differently 

expressed and that the transcriptional response induced by nanocopper was 

divergent from the one that was generated by the soluble copper, which suggests 

that the effects caused by nanocopper are not only due to solubility.  

In the present study the effect of two copper forms in Enchytaeus albidus, copper-

salt and nanosized copper, were assessed and compared. Enchytraeids 

(Oligochaeta) are important members of the soil fauna that have been used in 

ecotoxicological laboratory tests for more than 30 years (Rombke and Moser 

2002) and have established standard guideline (ISO 2003). They are ecologically 

relevant, being abundant in many soils contributing to the improvement of the pore 

structure of the soil and, indirectly, to the degradation of the organic matter. Effects 

were assessed in terms of oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation, superoxide 

dismutase, catalase, glutathione_total, oxidized and reduced, glutathione 

reductase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase) and neuro-

muscular (cholinesterases) biomarkers. Additionally, three different exposure 

times (2, 4 and 8 days) and two exposure concentrations of copper and nano 

copper were analysed.

2. Material and Methods 
 
2.1. Test organism 
 

The test organism used belongs to the species Enchytraeus albidus, Henle 1837. 

The individuals were maintained in laboratory cultures under controlled conditions, 

e.g. photoperiod 16:8h light:dark and a temperature of 18ºC. Details of culturing 

are given in (Rombke and Moser 2002). 

 

2.2. Test soil 
 
The test soil used was from the natural site in Hygum, Denmark. Soil was 

homogenized and sterilized. The general physico-chemical characteristics of soil 

from the Hygum-site are as follows: 20-32% coarse sand (&gt;200Am), 20-25% fine 

sand (63- 200Am), 11-20% coarse silt (20-63Am), 12-20% silt (20-20Am), 12-16% 

clay (&lt;2Am) and 3.6-5.5% humus. The soil was sampled to a depth of 20 cm. To 

exclude soil animals already present, the soil was dried at 80°C for 24 h in an oven 

(Memmert, Type UL40, Braunschweig, Germany) and then sieved through a 2-mm 

mesh to remove larger particles.  

 

2.3. Chemical substances 
 

The nanoparticles were made of Cu with a mean diameter of 80 nm, (PW-XRD 

&lt;74 nm, DLS = 419±1 nm, Zeta = 15.3±0.3) and a purity of 99.5%. The 

nanoparticles were added to the soil following transfer to deionised water and 

ultrasonic-steering for 15 min. The Cu-salt was obtained from CuCl2 solubilised in 

water. The concentrations used were 450 and 750 mg/Kg of copper and 

nanosized copper. 

 

2.4. Test procedure 
 

After homogeneous mixing, sub-samples of the batch of soil were introduced into 

the test vessels. Fifteen adult worms with well developed clitellum were introduced 

in each test vessel, each containing 25 g moist soil (40 to 60% of the maximum 

WHC). The vessel was covered with a lid (containing small holes) and the worms 



 

 43

were exposed for two, four and eight days (in the absence of food) at 20ºC and a 

16:8h photoperiod. Seven replicates per treatment were used. At test end, animals 

of each replicate were carefully removed, rinsed in deionised water, weighed and 

frozen in liquid Nitrogen. Samples were stored at -80ºC till further analysis. 

 

2.5. Biochemical analysis 
 

Each sample containing 15 organisms was homogenized in 1500µL K-Phosphate 

0,1M buffer, pH 7,4. Part of the tissue homogenate (300µL) was separated into a 

microtube with 5µL BHT (2,6-dieter-butyl-4-metylphenol) 4% in methanol for lipid 

peroxidation (LPO) determination. The remaining tissue homogenate (1200µL) of 

each sample was centrifuged at 10000g for 20 min at 4ºC, to isolate the Post-

Mithocondrial Supernatant (PMS). The PMS was divided into eight microtubes, 

stored at -80ºC, for posterior analysis of biomarkers and protein quantification. 

 

2.5.1. Determination of lipid peroxidation 

 

The extent of LPO was measured as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 

(TBARS) at 535nm (Bird and Draper 1984; Ohkawa et al. 1979).   

 

2.5.2. Quantification of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants 

 

Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity was determined based on the reduction of 

cytochrome c by superoxide radicals generated by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase 

system. Measurements were recorded at 550nm (McCord and Fridovich 1969) 

adapted to microplate. Catalase (CAT) activity was measured following the 

decrease in absorbance at 240nm due to H2O2 (substrate) decomposition 

(Clairborne 1985). Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) activity was determined following 

the oxidation of NADPH, at 340nm, when GSSG is reduced back to GSH by 

glutathione reductase, using H2O2 as substrate (Mohandas et al. 1984). 

Glutathione Reductase (GR) activity was measured assessing the decrease of 

NADPH level, at 340nm (Cribb et al. 1989). Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) 

activity was measured at 340nm, following the conjugation of GSH with CDNB (the 



 

 44

substrate with the broadest range of GST isozymes detectability) (Habig et al. 

1974). For more details see (Howcroft et al. 2009). Total glutathione (TG, GSH + 

GSSG) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were measured at 412 nm, using the 

recycling reaction of reduced glutathione (GSH) with DTNB in the presence of GR 

excess (Baker et al. 1990; Tietze 1969). 2-Vinyl-pyridine was used to conjugate 

GSH for the GSSG determination (Griffith 1980). The GSH content was calculated 

by subtraction of GSSG from the total glutathione. 

 

2.5.3. Quantification of Cholinesterases activity 

 

Cholinesterases (ChEs) activity was measured using Ellman method (Ellman et al. 

1961) adapted to microplate (Guilhermino et al. 1996). ChE activity was 

determined in the PMS, using 50 µL of sample and 250 µL of reaction buffer (30 

mL K-phosphate buffer 0.1 M pH 7.2, 1 mL DTNB 10 mM in K-phosphate buffer 

with 7.5 mg NaHCO3 and 0.2 mL acetylthiocoline 0.075 M solution as the 

substrate). The absorbance was measured at 414 nm. 

 

2.5.4. Protein quantification 

 

Protein concentration was assayed using the Bradford method (Bradford 1976), 

adapted from BioRad's Bradford micro-assay set up in a 96 well flat bottom plate, 

using bovine ?-globuline as a standard.    

 

2.6. Statistical analysis 
 

The main aim of this experiment was to analyse differences in response induction 

between the salt form (CuCl2) compared to the nano form (NP-Cu). Multivariate 

analysis (Principal Component Analysis, PCA) was performed using SAS 9.1.3 

(2002-2004). Data was standardized (mean between 0 and 1). Univariate 

statistical analysis was also performed using the software SigmaPlot11 (SPSS, 

1997): one-way ANOVA (Dunnett's Method) was used to compare differences 

between control and treatments, for each individual exposure time. A t-test was 

used to compare differences between Cu versus Np-Cu within the same 



 

 45

concentration and different concentration of the same compound. One-way 

ANOVA (Holm-Sidak) was used to compare differences due to different times of 

exposure.  

 

 

3. Results 
 

3.1. Multivariate analysis – trends in data 
 
Multivariate analysis (Principal Component Analysis, PCA) was performed with the 

aim of finding trends. Trends in PCA are based on the individual samples and not 

on mean values as performed in the uni-variate analysis (see below). When 

pooling all data the first three PCA axes explained 60-70% of the variation, with a 

clear indication of that data (graph not shown) were grouped according to 

exposure durations and exposure concentration. Analysis of the control organisms 

showed a clear time related enzymatic response. Given this, the data were 

subsequently treated in accordance with the test design i.e. analysing difference 

between Cu-NP and Cu-salt within all combinations (termed “treatment”) of days 

and concentrations. For each of these treatments there was a clear discrimination 

between the three groups: the control, Cu-salt and Cu-NP exposed organisms 

(graph not shown), but in the subsequent description only the possible difference 

between the Cu-salt and Cu-NP is described as this is the main aim of the study. 

Performing the PCA for each treatment showed that 70-80% of the variation could 

be explained by the first three axis of the PCA.

Figure 1: PCA graphs for the combinations of exposure time and concentration. Red dots 

represent copper nanoparticles and green dots copper-salt. Top row figures show the 

concentration of 450 mg/Kg at 2 days (A), 4 days (B) and 8 days (C);lower row figures 

show the concentration of 750 mg/Kg  at 2 days (D), 4 days (E) and 8 days (F). The 

biomarkers represented are: lipid peroxidation (LPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), 

catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), Glutathione reductase (GR), reduced 

glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), total glutathione (TG), glutathione-S-

transferase (GST) and cholinesterases (ChE).   

 
As seen from the graphs, clear separation between Cu-salt (green dots) and NP-

Cu (red dots) exposed organisms (each dot representing one organism sample) 

was possible for all except for day 4 of the 450mg Cu/kg exposed and for the day 

2 of the 750 mg Cu/kg exposed (see Fig 1). The separation pattern and which 

enzymes were correlated best with a discrimination, was both dependent on the 

exposure concentration and the exposure time, that is, no single enzymatic 

response could be used to identify either the Cu-salt or the NP-Cu at all 

concentrations and times. For the 450 mg Cu/kg exposure, day 2 showed that the 

D E F 

A B C 



 

 47

discrimination was best determined by the difference between GSSG, CAT GSH 

and TG. GSSG had a strong positive response (increase compared to Cu-NP) for 

the Cu-salt, whereas CAT, GSH and TG had a strong positive response in the Cu-

NP (increased compared to Cu-salt). LPO, SOD, GST, GR, GPx and ChE were of 

little importance in discriminating between the groups. For the latter group the 

LPO, SOD and GST displayed an inverse response to GR, GPx and ChE, that is, 

when the former group were high the latter was generally low. For day 4 of the 

450mg Cu/kg exposure, TG showed an opposite response to ChE and GST, and 

GSH, GR and GPx an opposite response to CAT, LPO, GSSG and SOD. No clear 

separation of the group was possible.  A clear separation was possible for the two 

groups in the day 8 exposure of the 450 mg Cu/kg.  In general there was a strong 

positive response of GPx, LPO, GST and SOD for NP-Cu exposed organisms and 

a strong (although less strong) positive response of GSH for Cu-salt exposed 

organisms, compared of course to the other group. Although, not highly important 

for discriminating between the two groups GR, CAT and GSSG showed an inverse 

response to TG and ChE.   

For the 750 mg Cu/kg exposure, it was not possible to make a clear separation of 

the two groups for 2 days exposed organisms. For these organisms SOD and TG 

showed an inverse response compared to GPx, CAT and inverse compared to 

GSH, and although not so strong GST, GR and ChE had an inverse response to 

LPO and GSSG.  For the day 4 exposure of the 750 mg Cu /kg CAT, LPO and 

ChE showed a strong relationship with Cu-NP exposure with GSH showing an 

inverse relationship, GSH had a strong positive response in Cu-salts. Less clearly 

discriminating and less expressed in the Cu-salt organisms was GST and TG. Not 

important for discrimination between the two groups GR, SOD and GSSG had an 

inverse response compared to GPx. Finally for the day 8 of the 750 mg Cu/kg, the 

NP exposed organisms had a strong expression of GSSG, whereas for the Cu-salt 

GSH and GST, and to a lesser extend LPO and ChE was stronger expressed.  

Little important for discrimination GR, SOD and CAT was inversely expressed 

compared to TG.

3.2. Univariate analysis – detailed approach to data 
 

3.2.1. Effect of the test chemicals (Cu and Np-Cu) and different 

concentrations (450/750 mg/kg) on the enzymatic activity 

 

Results (Fig. 2) show significant differences in the majority of biomarkers, due to 

exposure to both Cu-salt and Cu-NP. Changes with higher level of significance 

were observed in terms of increase in LPO levels (Fig. 2J) after 8 days of 

exposure, except for Cu-NP 750. Also at 8 days exposure, GSSG (Fig. 2B) was 

stimulated by Cu-NP treatments while GPx activity decreases (Fig. 2E), except for 

Cu-NP 450. At 4 days exposure, GPx activity increases with concentration 

increase and is higher for all NP versions. Similarly GSSG activity increases in 

both concentrations of both chemicals, while GSH activity decreases (Fig. 2A). At 

2 days of exposure GSSG activity was stimulated by ionic Cu-salt treatments while 

GR decreases (Fig. 2F).

the same concentration p&lt;0.05). 

 

3.2.2. Effects of copper-salt versus nanosized copper 

 

Some of the biomarkers assessed showed different responses depending on the 

chemical size applied (Cu or Cu-NP) (Fig. 2). At 2 days exposure, GR and GSH 

activities (Fig. 2F, 2A) were more inhibited by Cu than by Cu-NP. The activity of 

CAT at 4 days exposure (Fig. 2G) was inhibited by Cu 750, which was significantly 

different form Np-Cu 750. The same response, at 4 days exposure, was observed 

for the biomarkers GR, SOD and ChE, being the activities significantly smaller 

when exposed at Cu 750 when compared to Cu-NP 750.  

 

3.2.3. Effects of concentration (450 versus 750 mg/Kg)  

The different toxic concentration used caused different effects on some of the 

biomarkers. SOD and ChE activities at 4 days exposure, were significantly 

reduced in Cu 750 in comparison to Cu 450. CAT levels, at 4 days of exposure 

were reduced for the highest concentration of Cu and LPO levels, at 8 days of 

exposure were significantly higher for Cu 750 when compared to Cu 450. For the 

NPs, lower concentration has more effect than the highest on GSSG activity and 

LPO levels.  

 
3.2.4. Effects of exposure time on biomarkers response 

As mentioned before in the text, PCA analysis showed an exposure time related 

enzymatic response. Univariate analysis performed confirmed also that 

biomarkers responses varied with the time of exposure: GPx activity on controls 

was significantly different between the three exposure times. GR, GSH and TG 

activity decreased on controls at 4 and 8 days of exposure. Cu 450 caused a 

different response in SOD between 4 and 8 days, GSH and TG between 2 and 4 

days, GSSG different between the three times of exposure and LPO is different at 

8 days in comparison to 2 and 4 days. When exposed to Cu-NP 450, GSH, TG 

and GSSG activities were different between all exposure times, SOD activity was 



 

 51

different at 8 days, GR activity differed only at 2 days, CAT response differ 

between 2 and 4 days and LPO levels between 4 and 8 days. Cu 750 caused an 

increase in SOD, LPO and ChE levels at 8 days; GPX activity was increased at 4 

days; CAT activity was different between all the times of exposure; GSH and TG 

responses were different between 2 and 4 days and GSSG response differ 

between 4 and 8 days. Cu-NP 750 caused a GSH and TG responses that were 

different between all the times of exposure; GSSG and LPO levels differ at 2 days, 

comparing to 4 and 8 days; GPx activity was different between 2 and 4 days and 

GST between 2 and 8 days. 

 

4. Discussion 
 

The subsequent discussion is based on the assumption that the effects present in 

the Cu-NP exposed organisms is indeed caused by nano-copper fully or to some 

extend and not by dissolved Cu: it must however be realised that this may not be 

the case but, at present, there is no method to verify and quantify this. 

Nevertheless, the results do indicate which responses should be further studied to 

discriminate between Cu-salt and Cu-NP. It was observed (although not shown) 

that the response in all the exposed organisms were different from that of the 

controls. 

Results show that both copper-salt and nano-copper caused changes in all 

parameters evaluated and in the different times of exposure, revealing that 

organisms are facing an oxidative stress status but this is changing over time. In 

fact, the biomarkers response showing the best discrimination of the nano and the 

salt form was dependent on the exposure duration and concentration i.e. there 

was not one biomarker that provided the best discrimination. 

The current results show that SOD activity increased, after 8 days of exposure at 

Cu-NP 450. SOD is an antioxidant enzyme that protects tissues against 

superoxide anion radical catalysing its conversion in H2O2, which is detoxified by 

CAT and GPx. Increased SOD activity as a response to metals, including copper, 

has already been observed in several organism (Drazkiewicz et al. 2007; Jing et 

al. 2006; Sampaio et al. 2008).  



 

 52

A previous study performed with E. albidus exposed to Cu (320 mg/Kg) (Howcroft 

et al. 2009) showed no differences in SOD activity, at 2 days and 3 weeks 

exposure. The differences found between the present results and literature could 

be explained by the different soil type used (Gomes et al. 2009). Hygum soil 

affects reproduction, being itself a possible cause of stress. This fact can be a 

possible explanation to the fact that in our results the controls of GPx, GR, GSH 

and TG varied between times of exposure. The increase in GPx activity (a 

common response at hydroperoxides accumulation as will be discussed bellow) 

plus the inhibition of GR and GSH are signals of stress. The increased levels of 

LPO at 8 days of exposure, indicated that the organisms are suffering oxidative 

damage and that the effects caused by copper-salt (Cu) were more pronounced 

than those caused by nano-copper (Cu-NP), especially at the highest 

concentration tested. The results show that the higher concentration of Cu caused 

significant increase in LPO levels while the same did not occur for Cu-NP. Results 

in LUFA 2.2 soil (Howcroft et al. 2009) show that the antioxidant defence 

processes in E. albidus were able to prevent oxidative damage (LPO) on short 

exposures to copper (2 days), but not after 3 weeks. Our data suggests that 8 

days of exposure at a sub-lethal concentration of copper (450 mg/Kg) are already 

causing oxidative damage. 

CAT activity was inhibited at 4 days of exposure when exposed to Cu 750. CAT 

and GPx are antioxidant enzymes responsible for the detoxification of 

hydroperoxides (H2O2). It is suggested by Atli and co-authors (2006) that CAT 

inhibition may be related to the inactivation of the enzyme due to the direct binding 

of metal ions to –SH groups on the enzyme molecule. It is also suggested that no 

changes in CAT activity may be related to the increase in other antioxidant 

enzymes and/or substrates, such as GPx and GSH.  

At 4 days exposure, GPx increased as GSH decreased: attending to the fact that 

GPx activity comes as an attempt to detoxification of H2O2 (and other organic 

hydroperoxides) using GSH as substrate (and producing GSSG which is then 

regenerated into GSH by GR) (Thomas et al. 1990), the decrease in GSH activity 

observed at 4 days of exposure can result from its use as substrate by GPx in its 

antioxidant activity. This can be supported by the fact that, at this time of exposure 



 

 53

no significant changes were observed in GR, TG and GST. The results also show 

that the depletion of GSH is not being compensated by GR, resulting in the 

increase of GSSG observed.  

No changes occurred in ChEs, at any treatment or time of exposure. ChEs are a 

group of enzymes related with neuronal functions and in recent decades some 

studies have been published regarding the effect of metals in AChE activity (the 

main cholinesterase present in six earthworms’ whole body (Rault et al. 2007)), 

but results are contradictory:  Frascos’ results (Frasco et al. 2005) show that 

metals (including copper) caused AChE inhibition in vitro.  

Regarding the different concentrations tested, Cu showed a dose effect, with the 

highest concentration causing more effects than the lower. For Cu-NP, LPO levels 

were higher for 450mg/kg (Cu-NP 750 did not cause lipid peroxidation). This could 

be indicative of a bell-shape response which was already observed for other stress 

biomarkers (Dagnino et al. 2007; Dazy et al. 2009), nevertheless it is hard to 

confirm such conclusion without testing more concentrations.   

In general, the results seem to indicate that, at 2 days of exposure, the organisms 

start to respond to the oxidative stress imposed by copper-salt and copper 

nanoparticles. At 4 days of exposure GPx was the main defence against oxidative 

damage, for which E. albidus could not compensate for at 8 days of exposure 

(resulting in LPO increase). 

At 4 days of exposure to 750 mg/kg differences between Cu and Cu-NP are very 

pronounced, while those observed between the concentrations of 450mg/kg at 2 

days of exposure do not persist after that. Cu-salt exposure caused lower values 

of CAT compared to Cu-NP; attending to the fact that copper can bind directly to 

CAT that could mean that copper binding is higher for Cu-salt than for Cu-NP. 

Reduced activity of CAT results in the accumulation of hydroperoxides, which can 

be removed by GPx until a saturation point leading ultimately to the higher LPO 

levels (observed at 8 days). On the other hand, higher values of CAT and GR at 

Cu-NP in comparison to Cu-salt, associated with the activity of GPx, seem to have 

avoided the ultimate cellular damage, LPO.

5. Conclusions 
 

Both salt- and nano-copper caused oxidative stress and damage to E. albidus, and 

effects could be discriminated between the copper forms. Nevertheless and 

despite the visible discrimination between nano and the salt form (time and 

exposure dependent), there was not one or a set of biomarkers that provided the 

best discrimination. In general, effects of Cu-salt were more pronounced especially 

at LPO level. GPx seemed to be the main antioxidant acting against the stress 

imposed, and associated with GSH and GSSG were the biomarkers with more 

robust response. The selected time intervals were adequate to follow the evolution 

of the stress response until oxidative damage. To better characterize these 

responses a broader range of concentrations should be tested. Further research is 

needed to link these effects with higher levels of biological organization.

Abstract 
 
Nanotechnology is an emergent technology with applications in science, 
technology and medicine. Despite the increased utilization of nanoparticles, the 
behavior and effects in the environment is largely unknown and few resources are 
available for health and environmental effects studies. Enchytraeids are 
extensively used in studies of soil toxicology (ISO No. 16387, 2005) and recently, 
a cDNA microarray for E. albidus, was developed and toxicogenomic studies are 
also possible. These organisms are small worms that indirectly contribute to the 
regulation and degradation of organic matter, being ecologically relevant. In this 
study we compared the gene expression profiles of Enchytraeus albidus when 
exposed to copper-salt (CuCl2) and copper nanoparticles spiked soil. The worms 
were exposed for 48 hours to a range of concentrations in soil. Microarray 
hybridizations revealed a different response patterns between copper-salt and 
copper nanoparticles, with a higher number of differentially expressed genes due 
to the copper salt exposure, however the discrimination between copper 
nanoparticles and copper-salt was not possible, neither the unravelling of the 
underlying mechanisms of toxicity.

1. Introduction 
 
Nanotechnology is an emergent discipline with several applications (electronics, 

consumer products, medicine, environmental remediation, and catalysts), with 

rapidly increasing investments from businesses and from governments in many 

parts of the world (The Royal Society &amp;amp; The Royal Academy of Engineering 2004). 

The use of nanomaterials is dramatically increasing and will continue over the next 

years, producing “nanowastes” that will probably enter in the environment from 

manufacturing effluent, from washing off consumer products or through landfills 

and other methods of disposal. Despite the fact that most people are concerned 

with effects on large wildlife (particularly the human being), the basis of many food 

chains depends on the benthic and soil fauna and flora, which could be 

dramatically affected by the release of nanomaterials in the environment, whose 

behavior and effects are largely unknown (Oberdorster et al. 2005). 

Copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) have been given considerable attention due to 

their properties e.g. high electrical and thermic conductivities which make them 

very useful in modern electronics (Lee et al. 2008b; Tummala et al. 2006), 

metallurgy (Dhas et al. 1998; Samim et al. 2007) and catalysis. Copper is known 

to cause oxidative damage in organisms via the Haber-Weiss reaction, catalyzing 

the formation of  the powerful oxidant hydroxyl radical (OH·) (Bremner 1998) and 

recent investigation has shown that sublethal concentrations of copper caused 

mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in the reduction of the amount of energy 

available and a switch to metabolism of stored carbohydrates (Bundy et al. 2008). 

The environmental effects of copper nanoparticles are still poorly known. When 

compared to soluble copper, copper nanoparticles were less toxic to mice ( LD50 

of 110 and 413 mg/Kg respectively) (Chen et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2006; Meng et 

al. 2007) and zebrafish (EC50 of 0.25 mg/L and 1.6 mg/L respectively). Results 

obtained by Griffitt and co-authors (Griffitt et al. 2007) suggests that the 

transcriptional response induced by copper nanoparticles was divergent from the 

induced by the soluble copper, indicating that the effects are caused by the copper 

nanoparticles and not (only) due to their solubilization.  



 

 65

At the moment, very little information is available about the effects of 

nanomaterials in terrestrial ecosystems (Johansen et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2008a; 

Scott-Fordsmand et al. 2008a; Scott-Fordsmand et al. 2008b; Tong et al. 2007).  

Among soil species used in ecotoxicology are the Enchytraeids (Oligochaeta), 

important members of the soil fauna (Rombke and Moser 2002). They are 

abundant in many soils contributing to the improvement of the pore structure of the 

soil and, indirectly, to the degradation of the organic matter (Amorim et al. 2005). 

Effect assessment is traditionally made at the individual level (ISO 2005), 

evaluating e.g. survival and reproduction. Recently, a cDNA microarray for E. 

albidus, was developed and toxicogenomic studies are also possible (Amorim et 

al. 2009). DNA microarrays provide a powerful tool to analyze global responses of 

an organism to stressors present in the environment. Trough the quantification of 

the expression of thousands of genes in a single experiment (Lettieri 2006; 

Rockett and Dix 1999), we can identify cellular components that may be damaged 

and repaired during the stress exposure, as well as mechanisms involved in 

cellular responses. The measurement of these responses can serve as a 

signal/marker for potential effects at population level.  

Therefore, in the present study the main objective was to compare the effect of 

copper salt versus nanosized copper, at the gene level in E. albidus. The test 

species was exposed to varying concentrations of copper and nanosized copper 

and its gene expression profile was analyzed through the cDNA microarray. 

 
 
2. Material and Methods 
 
2.1. Test organism 
 

The test organism used belongs to the specie Enchytraeus albidus, Henle 1837. 

The individuals were maintained in laboratory cultures under controlled conditions, 

e.g. photoperiod 16:8h light:dark and a temperature of 18ºC, details of culturing in 

(Rombke and Moser 2002). 

Laboratory cultures of the test species Enchytraeus albidus (Henle, 1837) were 

maintained in moist soil (50% OECD soil, 50% natural garden soil), at 18ºC with a 



 

 66

photoperiod of 16:8h (light:dark), and fed once a week with finely ground and 

autoclaved rolled oats (Cimarrom, Portugal). Details of the culturing process are 

given in Römbke and Möser (2002). 

 

2.2. Test soil 

The test system was based on homogenized and sterilized field collected soil from 

Hygum, Denmark. The general physico-chemical characteristics of soil from the 

Hygum-site are as follows: 20-32% coarse sand (&gt;200µm), 20-25% fine sand (63-

200µm), 11-20% coarse silt (20-63µm), 12-20% silt (20-20µm), 12-16% clay 

(&lt;2µm) and 3.6-5.5% humus. The soil was sampled to a depth of 20 cm. To 

exclude soil animals already present, the soil was dried at 80°C for 24 h in an oven 

(Memmert, Type UL40, Braunschweig, Germany) and then sieved through a 2 mm 

mesh to remove larger particles. 

 

2.3. Chemical substances 
 

The nanoparticles were made of Cu with a mean diameter of 80 nm, (PW-XRD 

&lt;74 nm, DLS = 419±1 nm, Zeta = 15.3±0.3) and a purity of 99.5%. The 

nanoparticles were added to the soil following transfer to deionised water and 

ultrasonic-steering for 15 min. The Cu-salt was obtained from CuCl2 solubilised in 

water. The concentrations used 400, 600, 800 and 1000 mg/Kg of copper and 

nanosized copper. 

 

2.4. Experimental procedure 

After homogeneous mixing, sub-samples of the batch of soil were introduced into 

the test vessels. Fifteen adult worms with well developed clitellum were introduced 

in each test vessel, each containing 25 g moist soil (40 to 60% of the maximum 

WHC). The vessel is covered with a lid (containing small holes) and the worms 

were exposed for 48h at 20ºC and a 16:8h photoperiod. Four replicates per 

treatment were used. At test end, animals were carefully removed, rinsed in 

deionised water, stored in RNA later (Ambion) and frozen in liquid Nitrogen. 



 

 67

Samples were stored at -80ºC till further analysis. Hybridization experiments, 

control versus exposed, were always made in triplicate, using biological replicates.  

 
2.5. RNA extraction  
 
Isolation of total RNA from enchytraeids was performed through the Trizol 

extraction method (Invitrogen, Belgium). RNA extraction was followed by a DNAse 

treatment (Fermentas Germany). The quantity and purity of the isolated RNA were 

measured spectrophotometrically with Nanodrop and its quality was checked on a 

denaturing agarose gel. 

 

2.6. cDNA synthesis and Amminoallyl labeling  
 

Equal quantities of RNA were pooled for all control and exposed organisms 

samples. mRNA spike mix (lucidea controls) (GE Healthcare, Amersham) and 

random hexamer primers (Invitrogen) were added to the RNA. To convert RNA in 

cDNA, the amminoallyl-dNTPs mix (containing a 2:3 ratio of aminoallyl-dUTP 

(Invitrogen)) and 200U/µL Superscript II RT (Invitrogen) were incorporated. 

Unincorporated amminoallyl-dUTPs were removed using modified Qiagen PCR 

spin column protocol. Amminoallyl labeled cDNA was covalently bound to 

appropriate NSH-esters Cy Dyes (Amersham). Cy3 was coupled with control and 

Cy5 with treatments. Uncoupled dyes were removed using the QIAquick PCR 

purification kit (Qiagen). The efficiency of labeling reaction was measured 

spectrophotometrically with a Nanodrop. Dye incorporation per sample of 

approximately 150pmol and a frequency of dye incorporation (FOI) less than 50 

are near optimal for hybridization. 

 

2.7. Microarrays 

Previously developed cDNA normalized library (Amorim et al. 2009) was spotted 

onto Generoma microarray slides (Asper Biotech, Estonia) and used in the present 

study.

2.8. Hybridization of microarrays 
 
Before the hybridization, the arrays were incubated in pre-hybridization buffer, 

consisting of 50% formamide, 5×SSC, 0,1% SDS and 0,1 BSA, at 42ºC for 60 

minutes. After that, the arrays were washed by immersion in ultra pure water 

followed by immersion in isopropanol, and immediately dried with compressed N2. 

The vacuum dried samples were resolved in hybridization solution consisting of 

50% formamide, 5×SSC, 0,1% SDS and 0,1 mg of Salmon sperm (SIGMA), a 

nucleic-acid blocker. The probe solution (that results of the combination of Cy3 

and Cy5 labeling probes), incubated at 95ºC for 5 minutes, was applied on the 

cover-slides in the array. The array was placed in Genetix hybridization chamber 

where the hybridization was performed at 42ºC overnight. After the hybridization, 

the arrays were immersed in four wash solutions containing decreasing 

concentrations of SSC and SDS, finally the arrays were rinsed in MilliQ water and 

isopropanol for 1 minute and immediately dried in compressed N2. Three 

replicates of each treatment were done, hybridizing each treatment versus the 

control sample. 

 
2.9. Scanning and analysis of microarray data 
 
Scanning was performed using an Agilent Microarray Scanner (Agilent 

Technologies) at 532 and 635 nm for Cy3 and Cy5 respectively. The images 

acquired were assessed using Quant Array (Packard Biochip Technologies) for 

spot identification and for quantification of fluorescent signal intensities. 

Subsequently data were analyzed with limmaGUI package (based on limma 

(Smyth 2005)) in the R (2.8.0) software environment (http://www.R-project.org). 

The fluorescent signal intensity for each DNA spot was calculated using 

background subtraction and saturated signal were excluded from further analysis. 

After that, a within and between array normalization was applied using global loess 

(Yang et al. 2002) and scale methods respectively. Quality control was done by 

making MA-plots and box plots of each array. Differential expression was 

assessed using linear models and Benjamini-Hochberg’s (BH) method to correct 

for multiple testing (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) (adjusted p&lt;0.05 was 

considered significant). Assessment of differential expression of genes was done 



 

 69

for each treatment separately, and resulted in a mean log2 expression ratio 

(treated/untreated) and a p-value for each probe on the array. All cDNA fragments 

correspondent to differentially expressed genes (adjusted p&lt;0.05) were identified 

based on their homology to sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology 

Information (NCBI) database as determined by the Basic Local Alignment Search 

Tool (BLAST). Both nucleotide–nucleotide and nucleotide–protein homology 

searches were done to identify the isolated clones (BLASTN and BLASTX). 

 

2.10. Quantitative RT PCR 
 
Total RNA (500ng) from the samples used for microarrays was converted into 

cDNA through a reverse transcription reaction using the SuperScript First-Strand 

Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was carried out on 

7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), using Platinum SYBR Green 

qPCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen). Primer sets were designed for 5 target genes 

and one endogenous control gene (table 1) with the software Oligo Explorer
TM

 

(version 1.1.0). Determination of PCR efficiency and specificity was done by the 

obtaining standard and melting curves, respectively for all primer sets. cDNA was 

diluted 1:4 and 2 µL was used in 20 µL PCR reaction volumes containing 2 µL of 

forward and 2 µL of reverse  primers (2 µM),  10 µL of Platinum SYBR Green 

qPCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen) and 4 µL of DEPC water. qPCR was performed 

in triplicate for each sample, on a 96-well optical plate (GeneAmp®, Applied 

Biosystems). Reaction conditions consisted of one initial cycle at 50ºC for 2 min, 

followed by one denaturation step at 95ºC for 2 min, 40 cycles at 95 ºC for 10 sec, 

and a dissociation step consisting of 15 sec at 95 ºC, 1 min at 60 ºC, and 15 sec at 

95 ºC. 

A mean normalized expression value was calculated from the obtained Ct values 

with Relative Expression Software Tool (REST-MSC) using actin as a reference 

gene (housekeeping) for normalization of input cDNA.

3. Results and Discussion 
 
Using linear models and empirical Bayes methods (Smyth 2005), a total of 127 in 

480 gene fragments were identified as differently expressed (BH adjusted p&lt;0.05). 

Cu salt treatment caused 68, 32, 10 and 4 significant transcripts and Cu 

nanoparticles 26, 2, 39 and 1, for the concentrations 400, 600, 800 and 1000 

mg/Kg respectively. No additional fold-change cut-off was used to identify 

differently expressed genes because, as stated in Nota (Nota et al. 2008), slight 

changes in gene expression could also result in major physiological effects. Figure 

1 shows an overview of differently expressed genes for the different treatments.

concentrations  (400, 600, 800 and 1000 mg/Kg) of Cu-salt (Cu) and copper nanoparticles 

(Np-Cu).  



 

 71

In general, there are more down than up-regulated genes, as also been observed 

in several studies (Bakel et al. 2005; Lewis and Keller 2009; Nota et al. 2008). Cu 

salt caused a dose-response like decrease in the number of differently expressed 

genes. Nano-Cu does not show a pattern.   

All the differently expresses transcripts had been previously sequenced (Amorim 

et al, 2009) and were subjected to recent BLAST homology search (BLASTX as 

well as BLASTN). Only 28 of 127 differentially expressed gene fragments had 

homology with sequences in public databases. From these 28 sequences, 2 had 

unknown function and the remaining 26 could be classified in functional categories 

(% of total no. of known genes): transcription and translation (28.6%), protein 

metabolism (21.4%), energy metabolism (17.9%), immune and stress response 

(10.7%), cell structure and cytoskeletal organization (3.6%), carbohydrate and fat 

metabolism (3.6%), signal transduction (3.6%) and development (3.6%) (Fig. 2). 

All the differently expressed genes with homology to sequences in public data are 

listed in Table 2.

Several genes encoding translational proteins were down-regulated by both 

copper and nano-copper exposure, including replication protein A3 (RPA3), 

transcription factor, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein D2, poly (ADP-ribose) 

polymerase member 14, and elongation factor-1 ?. RPA3 is the smallest subunit of 

Replication Protein A (RPA) and is believed to have a structural role in the 

assembly of RPA heterotrimer. RPA is a nuclear ssDNA binding protein which 

appears to be involved in all aspects of DNA metabolism including replication, 

recombination, and repair. A reduction in the amount of RPA could be indicative of 

DNA damage, since the recruitment of RPA to DNA damaged sites may contribute 

to its down-regulation (Wang et al. 1999). Poly ADP-ribose polymerase member 

14 (PARP14) is a multifunctional protein implicated in many cellular functions. 

PARP proteins are important components in the cellular responses to various 

kinds of insults to genomic DNA, including oxidative DNA damage, telomere 

erosion, or improper segregation of chromosomes, thus its down-regulation could 

cause severe damage to E. albidus. Elongation factor-1alpha (EF-1?) is an actin 

binding protein involved in the shuttling of aa-tRNA. It was also found down-

regulated in fathead minnow larvae when exposed to copper (Lewis and Keller 

2009) and in recent investigations, its down-regulation has been related with cell 

death (Byun et al. 2009; Kobayashi and Yonehara 2009) A gene coding for a 

ribosomal protein (ribosomal protein L7A) was found down-regulated by the 

treatments Cu e Cu-NP 400 and up-regulated by Cu 600.   

Energy metabolism was also affected by copper-salt and nano-copper. Short-

chain dehydrogenase and adipokinetic hormone akh2 where found down-

regulated while NADH dehydrogenase Fe-S protein 4 and cytochrome c were up-

regulated (tab 2). ATP synthase e chain was found up-regulated and down-

regulated by different treatments (tab 2). The disruption of genes associated with 

mitochondrial electron transport and consequent dysfunction due to copper 



 

 74

exposure has already been reported in the earthworm Lumbricus rubellus (Bundy 

et al. 2008). However, our data show the up-regulation of genes coding for NADH 

dehydrogenase Fe-S protein 4, ATP synthase e chain and cytochrome c 

(mitochondrial proteins). On the other hand, the up-regulation of monosaccharide-

transporting ATPase (in the treatments Cu-NP 400 and 800) is in accordance with 

Bundy’s results (Bundy et al. 2008), which suggests a switch to metabolism of 

stored carbohydrates after copper exposure. 

In the group of transcripts involved in protein metabolism, there are down-

regulated genes (serine-threonine kinase; calmodulin-domain protein kinase; and 

calcium-dependent protein kinase) and up-regulated genes (peptidoglycan 

recognition protein sc2, arginine and chaperonin subunit 8). Protein kinases play a 

role in a multitude of cellular processes, including division, proliferation, apoptosis 

and differentiation, which could be affected by the down-regulation of these three 

kinases. Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are involved in innate 

immunity. They are pattern recognition receptors that bind, and in certain cases, 

hydrolyze peptidoglycans (PGNs) of bacterial cell walls. The immune response of 

E. albidus can be compromised in the treatment Cu 400 due to the down-

regulation of the gene encoding for manose C type 1-like.This is a type I 

membrane receptor protein highly related to the mannose receptor C type 1 

protein (MRC1) which mediates the endocytosis of glycoproteins by macrophages 

and acts as phagocytic receptor for bacteria, fungi and other pathogens.  

Both chaperonins and heat shock proteins are involved in assisting the folding of 

proteins into their functional state, and genes coding for these proteins where 

found up-(tab 2). The gene HSPA8 encodes a heat shock cognate protein (that 

belongs to the heat shock protein 70 family) which binds to nascent polypeptides 

to facilitate correct folding. The up-regulation of transcripts encoding a heat shock 

protein (HSPA8), has already been observed in response to metals (Nota et al. 

2008). As suggested to cadmium (Nota et al. 2008), copper ions probably disturb 

the normal folding of proteins or cause indirect damage to proteins, e.g. trough the 

generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although copper is known to cause 

oxidative damage through the formation of hydroxyl radicals via the Haber-Weiss 



 

 75

reaction (Bremner 1998), the transcript encoding superoxide dismutase (SOD), an 

enzyme involved in antioxidant defence, was found down-regulated (tab. 2).

Figure 3: Gene expression changes observed in microarray and RT-PCR for superoxide 

dismutase (SOD), calcium dependent protein kinase (CaDPK), cytochrome c (citC), 

transcription factor (TransFact) and heat shock protein 8 (HSP8). Results are expressed 

by means of log2 ratio exposed/control.  

 

In Fig. 3, results from the RT-PCR analysis are shown. Except for SOD, in the 

treatment Cu 400, which showed to be, up-regulated in the RT-PCR, the 

expression of all genes in the microarray (tab 2) was confirmed in the RT-PCR. 

 It was confirmed that there was no concentration dependent response in any of 

the tested genes, which was in agreement with the microarray data (tab 2). For Cu 

(copper-salt) treatments, in general genes show the highest expression value at 

400mg/Kg and the lowest expression at 800 mg/Kg. In NP (nano-copper) 

treatments, the higher down-regulation (lowest expression value) was always 



 

 76

observed in 1000 mg/Kg, which suggest that the higher concentration of copper 

nanoparticles caused higher effects in gene expression of E. albidus. 

Based on differently expressed genes (BH adjusted p&lt;0,05), a cluster analysis 

(Pearson’s Uncentered) was performed to both genes and treatments. The cluster 

analysis of genes did not cluster according to function (GO homology), suggesting 

that either form of copper affected the same functions. However this information is 

poorly supported at the moment due to the fact that it is not know in which 

processes the “unknown” genes are involved.  

The cluster between treatments is shown in figure 4.

differently expressed genes (BH adjusted p&lt;0.05). 
 
No separation between treatments (Cu-salt or nano-Cu) is observed based on the 

cluster analysis. However, there is a trend to cluster by concentration range: the 

two smaller (400 and 600 mg/Kg, with the exception of Cu 600) and the two higher 

(800 and 1000 mg/Kg) concentrations are clustered separately. 

4. Conclusions 
 

DNA microarray analysis was an important tool in analysing effects, showing that 

there was differential gene expression in response to the different treatments. 

Additionally, transcriptional response induced by copper nanoparticles was 

different from those induced by the copper-salt. At the moment, in part due to the 

fact that E. albidus is a non-model organism and that the function of the great part 

of the genes is unknown, the discrimination between copper nanoparticles and 

copper-salt was not possible, neither the unravelling of the underlying mechanisms 

of toxicity.

General discussion and conclusions 
 

The results presented in this Masters thesis show a piece of research done 

regarding the use of sub-cellular and molecular biomarkers (oxidative stress, 

neuro-muscular and gene expression) in ecotoxicology. The purpose was to 

compare the responses in Enchytraeus albidus of the two copper forms: copper-

salt (CuCl2) and copper nanoparticles. Results show that both tools were adequate 

to assess effects, revealing oxidative stress and differently expressed genes 

although, not able to fully discriminate and interpret effects.  

The battery of biomarkers analysed in this study was chosen to have a broad 

range of enzymes: being the first time nanomaterials are studied in E. albidus we 

wished to obtain the general response of the organism. A clear separation 

between the two treatments was observed, which could indicate that the effects 

caused by nano-copper are not only due to the solubility. A time and concentration 

dependent response was also inferred. However, it was not possible to choose 

one or a group of biomarkers which could characterize the response. 

Nevertheless, glutathione-peroxidase and non-enzymatic glutathiones (reduced 

glutathione, oxidised glutathione) seemed to act as the main anti-oxidant defence 

against stress induced by copper (salt and nano form) at 4 days of exposure, even 

if cellular damage was occurring after 8 days, observed by the increased levels of 

lipid peroxidation. To discriminate between copper-salt and copper nanoparticles, 

a broader range of concentrations should be tested. 

At the gene expression level, in general, the biological functions affected were 

transcription and translation, protein metabolism, energy metabolism, immune and 

stress response, carbohydrate and fat metabolism, development, signal 

transduction and cell structure and cytoskeletal organization, all involving key 

functions that can lead to effects at higher levels of biological organization. In 

general, copper-salt caused a higher number of differently expressed transcripts. 

The proportion of genes in each category was different between the copper forms, 

however conclusions cannot be drawn based on these results, due to a large 

percentage of “unknown” gene functions. The fact that E. albidus is a non-model 



 

 84

organism (attending their use in molecular techniques since its genome has not 

been sequenced, and not according to the ecotoxicological point of view where it 

is, in fact, a model organism) and thus the analysis of the results is restricted by 

the homology of DNA fragments in other organisms, is a limiting factor in the 

interpretation of the results obtained.  

Further research is needed to link these effects with higher levels of biological 

organization, to allow the integration of effects at population, sub-cellular and 

molecular levels. More metal-based nanomaterials could be studied, using these 

parameters, to determine if the response is related to copper nanoparticles and, if 

so, to establish a group of biomarkers suitable to characterize this response.  

This study represents an important contribution on the field of ecotoxicology of 

nanomaterials to soil ecosystems/organisms.
