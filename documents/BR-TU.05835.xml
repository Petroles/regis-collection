Taxonomic review of the genus Trichomycterus Valenciennes (Siluriformes:
Trichomycteridae) from the laguna dos Patos system, Southern Brazil

Juliano Ferrer and Luiz R. Malabarba

The species of the genus Trichomycterus inhabiting the laguna dos Patos system are reviewed and five species are recognized.
Trichomycterus tropeiro Ferrer &amp;amp; Malabarba has a restricted range and is endemic to the uppermost portion of the rio das
Antas. Trichomycterus balios, n. sp., is distributed in the upper portion of the rio das Antas and rio Caí basins. Trichomycterus
diatropoporos, n. sp., is endemic to the rio da Prata basin, a tributary of the rio das Antas. Trichomycterus poikilos, n. sp., is
widely distributed in the upper portion of the rio Jacuí basin and tributaries of the rio Taquari-Antas. Trichomycterus
brachykechenos, n. sp., is endemic to the upper portion of the rio dos Sinos. The new species are distinguishable from most
congeners, except for T. davisi, T. mboycy, T. naipi, T. payaya, T. papilliferus, T. perkos, T. plumbeus, and T. tropeiro by the
lower number of pectoral-fin rays (I+5-6) and by the first pectoral-fin ray not prolonged as a filament. Other characters
distinguish the new taxa from these eight species. The distribution of the genus in the laguna dos Patos system is discussed
and a taxonomic key is provided.

O gênero Trichomycterus é revisado no sistema da laguna dos Patos e cinco espécies são reconhecidas. Trichomycterus
tropeiro Ferrer &amp;amp; Malabarba tem distribuição restrita, ocorrendo somente na porção mais superior do rio das Antas.
Trichomycterus balios, sp. n., distribui-se na porção superior das bacias dos rios das Antas e Caí. Trichomycterus
diatropoporos, sp. n., é endêmica da bacia do rio da Prata, tributário do rio das Antas. Trichomycterus poikilos, sp. n., é
amplamente distribuída nos cursos superiores da bacia do rio Jacuí e tributários dos rios Taquari-Antas. Trichomycterus
brachykechenos, sp. n., é endêmica do curso superior do rio dos Sinos. As espécies novas distinguem-se de grande parte de
seus congêneres pelo baixo número de raios na nadadeira peitoral (I+5-6) e o primeiro raio da nadadeira peitoral não prolongado
como filamento, exceto de T. davisi, T. mboycy, T. naipi, T. papilliferus, T. payaya, T. perkos, T. plumbeus e T. tropeiro,
distinguindo-se destas por outros caracteres. A distribuição do gênero no sistema da laguna dos Patos é discutida e uma
chave taxonômica é fornecida.

Introduction

The Trichomycteridae is a monophyletic group with a
distribution covering practically all of South America and lower
Central America, from Costa Rica to Argentina on both sides
of the Andes (de Pinna &amp;amp; Wosiacki, 2003). Currently, the family
is divided into seven monophyletic subfamilies
(Copionodontinae, Glanapteryginae, Sarcoglanidinae,
Stegophilinae, Trichogeninae, Tridentinae, and Vandelliinae)
plus the Trichomycterinae which, as presently conceived, is
demonstrably non-monophyletic (Baskin, 1973; de Pinna,
1998; Wosiacki, 2002; Datovo &amp;amp; Bockmann, 2010).

The Trichomycterinae is the only subfamily present
throughout the whole range distribution of the

Trichomycteridae and, despite its species richness, few
genera are recognized in the subfamily (de Pinna &amp;amp; Wosiacki,
2003): Bullockia Arratia, Chang, Menu-Marque &amp;amp; Rojas, 1978,
Eremophilus Humboldt, 1805, Hatcheria Eigenmann, 1909,
Ituglanis Costa &amp;amp; Bockmann, 1993, Rhizosomichthys Miles,
1943, Scleronema Eigenmann, 1917, and Silvinichthys Arratia,
1998 which are monophyletic; and Trichomycterus
Valenciennes, 1832, a polyphyletic group (Wosiacki, 2002)
containing over 145 valid species (Eschmeyer &amp;amp; Fong, 2013).

Despite the high number of described species within
Trichomycterus, Ferrer &amp;amp; Malabarba (2011) highlighted the
lack of taxonomic studies of this genus in the laguna dos
P a t o s  a n d  U r u g u a y  b a s i n s  i n  s o u t h e r n  B r a z i l .
Notwithstanding the common occurrence of the genus in



Review of Trichomycterus from laguna dos Patos drainage218

these basins, T. tropeiro Ferrer &amp;amp; Malabarba, 2011 endemic
to the headwaters of rio das Antas in laguna dos Patos system
is so far the only member of the genus recognized for that
drainage.

In the present study the Trichomycterus in the laguna
dos Patos system are reviewed through an extensive analysis
of large collections of specimens. Four new species are
recognized in addition to T. tropeiro. Comments on
distributions and an identification key are given for the species
of Trichomycterus from the laguna dos Patos system.

Material and Methods

Measurements were made point-to-point with digital
calipers to the nearest 0.1 mm. The measurements follow
Tchernavin (1944) for the length of barbels, Wosiacki &amp;amp; de
Pinna (2008) for the length and depth of the caudal peduncle
and for the supraorbital pore distance, Ferrer &amp;amp; Malabarba
(2011) for the scapular girdle and Costa (1992) for the remaining
measurements.

The nomenclature for osteological structures and
laterosensory canal system and associated pores followed
Bockmann et al. (2004). Vertebral counts exclude those in the
Weberian complex and the compound caudal centrum
(PU1+U1) is counted as one element. For osteological
analysis, 30 specimens were cleared and counterstained (c&amp;amp;s)
following the method proposed by Taylor &amp;amp; van Dyke (1985)
and nine were disarticulated. The counts of unsegmented
rays in c&amp;amp;s specimens are given before the number of
unbranched and segmented rays (represented by upper case
Roman numerals) and branched and segmented rays
(represented by Arabic numerals), counted in all specimens.
The counts for holotypes are represented by an asterisk in
variable meristics. Numbers of branchiostegal rays,
odontodes, procurrent rays, basal radials, ribs, vertebrae, and
unsegmented rays were counted only in c&amp;amp;s specimens.
Drawings of the osteological structures were made only from
c&amp;amp;s and disarticulated specimens.

Morphological data for species are based on literature,
personal observations and photographs from image database
of the All Catfishes Species Inventory (Morris et al., 2006),
Muséum National d’histoire naturelle (http://coldb.mnhn.fr/
Consultation?catalogue=7), and California Academy of
Sciences (http://collections.calacademy.org/ich/).
Trichomycterus santaeritae (Eigenmann, 1918) and the
species from T. hasemani group were not included in
comparisons due to their reported relationship with non-
trichomycterine taxa (de Pinna, 1989; Dutra et al., 2012).

Data are not available for T. arleoi (Fernández-Yépez, 1972).

Garavello, 2004; and T. tropeiro by the modal possession of
I+6 pectoral-fin rays (one among 108 specimens with I+7; vs.
I+5, I+7, or more pectoral-fin rays) and the first ray of the
pectoral fin not prolonged as a filament (Fig. 1; vs. the first ray
of the pectoral fin prolonged as a filament). Trichomycterus
balios is distinguished from T. davisi, T. diatropoporos, T.
papilliferus, T. payaya, T. perkos, and T. plumbeus by the
color pattern of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of body, which
presents circular black blotches variable in size (Fig. 1; vs. the
head and trunk with dark irregularly shaped spots scattered
in T. davisi; lateral surface of body with dark blotches variable
in size and shape progressively larger and coalescent dorsally
thus forming extensive black pigmented regions with light
yellow gaps in T. diatropoporos; dorsal and lateral surfaces
of body pale brown to light gray in T. payaya; dorsal and

lateral surfaces of body gray in T. papilliferus and T.
plumbeus; lateral surface of body with three wide dark brown
stripes in T. perkos). Trichomycterus balios is distinguished
from T. tropeiro by the presence of the pelvic girdle and pelvic
fins (Fig. 1; vs. absence); and the absence of pores i1 and i3 of
the infraorbital sensory canal (Fig. 2a; vs. presence).
Additionally, T. balios is distinguished from the remaining
congeners in the laguna dos Patos system by the possession
of 36-39 teeth on ceratobranchial 5 (Fig. 3a; vs. 12-13 in T.
diatropoporos and 20-23 in T. poikilos); 35-40 teeth on plate
connected to pharyngobranchial 4 (Fig. 3a; vs. 18-20 in T.
diatropoporos and 23-25 in T. poikilos); by the color pattern
of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of body with circular black
blotches variable in size [Fig. 1; vs. the dorsal and lateral
surfaces of body mottled dark brown over a light yellow

background or with three stripes (dorsosagittal, midlateral,
and ventrolateral) with notched borders in T. poikilos; the
dorsal and lateral surface of body densely mottled dark brown
over a light yellow background in T. brachykechenos].
Trichomycterus balios is further distinguishable from T.
poikilos by having the origin of the dorsal fin located at the
vertical through the last third of the pelvic fin (Fig. 1; vs. at
the vertical falling between the tip of the pelvic fin and the
anterior insertion of anal fin). Trichomycterus balios is further
distinguishable from T. brachykechenos by having a posterior
cranial fontanel extending from the parieto-supraoccipital to
the frontals (Fig. 2a; vs. the posterior cranial fontanel restricted
to the parieto-supraoccipital); the maxillary barbel length (37.8-
66.6% vs. 68.2-87.7% HL), the number of odontodes of the
opercular patch (13-19 vs. 8-11). Trichomycterus balios is
further distinguishable from T. diatropoporos by the insertion
of the first dorsal-fin basal radial anterior to the neural spine
of the 19th-22th vertebrae (vs. anterior to the neural spine of the
17th or 18th vertebrae).

Description. Morphometric data for holotype and paratypes
in Table 1. Body elongate, trunk roughly cylindrical and
gradually compressed towards caudal fin. Dorsal profile of
trunk convex along anterior half then straight to insertion of
dorsal fin. Ventral profile of trunk straight to slightly convex.
Dorsal and ventral profile of caudal peduncle straight to
slightly concave.

Head depressed, trapezoidal from dorsal view, wider
posteriorly. Dorsal profile straight and ventral profile straight

to slightly convex. Snout rounded from dorsal view. Eyes
readily visible, anteroposteriorly elliptical to rounded, dorsally
oriented; orbital rim not free, eyes covered with skin thin and
transparent. Each eye located over posterior termination of
shallow and small longitudinal crest beginning at posterior
nostril and making eyes visible from lateral view.

Nostrils of same size and smaller than eye diameter.
Anterior nostril surrounded by fleshy flap of integument
posterolaterally continuous with nasal barbel. Posterior nostril
surrounded anterolaterally by thin flap of integument. Gill
openings not constricted but united with isthmus anteriorly
forming a free fold. Mouth subterminal with corners
posteriorly oriented. Lower lip with conspicuous fleshy lobes
along lateral limits internal to origin of rictal barbels. Lips with
small papillae; papillae largest on inner surface of upper lip.

Barbels with large bases and tapering gradually towards
tip. Tip of nasal barbel usually reaching to between eye and
pore i11 or at most slightly extending beyond pore i11. Origin
of nasal barbels on posterolateral portion of integument flap
around anterior nostril. Maxillary barbel usually extending
between anterior and posterior margins of interopercular patch
of odontodes or at most slightly extending beyond to
posterior margin but never reaching pectoral-fin insertion.
Rictal barbel slightly shorter than maxillary barbel.

Mesethmoid with anterior margin slightly concave, cornua
short and thick, width of their bases similar to their length (Fig.
2a). Anterior cranial fontanel restricted to small rounded opening
situated between frontals and epiphyseal bar. Posterior cranial
fontanel long and narrow, extending from posterior portion of

headwaters of the rio Mampituba (Fig. 8). The type locality is
located at approximately 792 m a.s.l. and the remaining localities
of collection between 681 and 941 m a.s.l. The lower portions
of the laguna dos Patos system and of the rio Mampituba are
widely separated by the rio Tramandaí drainage, were T. balios
is unknow to occur (Malabarba et al., 2013). The occurrence
of the species in the headwaters of these two unconnected
and distant drainages (laguna dos Patos system and of the
rio Mampituba) is possibly related to headwater capture
events.

The localities where the types were collected had clear
water with current water and rocky bottoms (Fig. 9a).
Trichomycterus balios was collected with Cnesterodon
brevirostratus Rosa &amp;amp; Costa, 1993; Pareiorhaphis hystrix
(Pereira &amp;amp; Reis, 2002); and Bryconamericus patriciae da

Silva, 2004 at the type locality, other species that show some
degree of endemism in the region associated with high
altitudes (Rosa &amp;amp; Costa, 1993; Pereira &amp;amp; Reis, 2002, da Silva,
2004). The stomach of 13 c&amp;amp;s specimens contained larvae of
Diptera (Chironomidae, Simuliidae), Lepidoptera, and
Trichoptera; and nymphs of Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera.

Remarks. The type series includes only specimens from
laguna dos Patos system. Data of specimens from the rio
Mampituba identified as T. balios are not included in the
species description.

Etymology. From the Greek balios meaning spotted, in reference
to the color pattern of the new species formed by circular
black blotches. An adjective.

Review of Trichomycterus from laguna dos Patos drainage228

Trichomycterus diatropoporos is distinguished from T. balios,
T. brachykechenos, T. davisi, T. papilliferus, T. payaya, T.
perkos, T. plumbeus, T. poikilos, and T. tropeiro by the color
pattern of dark blotches variable in size and shape progressively
larger and coalescent dorsally thus forming extensive black
pigmented regions with light yellow gaps (Fig. 10; vs. the dorsal
and lateral surface of body with circular black blotches variable
in size in T. balios and T. tropeiro; the dorsal and lateral surfaces
of body densely mottled dark brown over a light yellow
background in T. brachykechenos; head and trunk with dark
brown irregularly shaped spots scattered in T. davisi; dorsal
and lateral surface of body pale brown to light gray in T. payaya,
dorsal and lateral surface of body gray in T. papilliferus and T.
plumbeus; lateral surface of body with three wide dark brown
stripes in T. perkos; dorsal and lateral surface of body mottled
dark brown over a light yellow background and sometimes
forming two stripes, midlateral and ventrolateral, with notched
borders in T. poikilos). Trichomycterus diatropoporos is further
distinguishable from T. poikilos by having the origin of the

dorsal fin located at the vertical through the last third of the
pelvic fin (Fig. 10; vs. at vertical falling between tip of the pelvic
fin and the anterior insertion of anal fin) and the origin of the
anal fin located at the vertical through the base of the last
dorsal-fin ray (Fig. 10; vs. at the vertical falling between the
anterior insertion of the dorsal fin and the middle of its length).
Trichomycterus diatropoporos is further distinguishable from
T. brachykechenos by having the posterior cranial fontanel
extending from the parieto-supraoccipital to the frontals (Fig.
2b; vs. the posterior cranial fontanel restricted to the parieto-
supraoccipital); the maxillary barbel length (38.3-53.9% vs.68.2-
87.7% HL); and the number of odontodes on the opercular
patch (13-19 vs. 8-11). Trichomycterus diatropoporos is further
distinguishable from T. balios by location of the insertion of
the first dorsal-fin basal radial anterior to neural spine of 17th or
18th vertebrae (vs. anterior to neural spine of 19th-22th vertebrae);
and the number of teeth on ceratobranchial 5 and on plate
connected to pharyngobranchial 4 (Fig. 2b; 12-13 vs. 36-39 and
18-20 vs. 35-40, respectively). Trichomycterus diatropoporos

is further distinguishable from T. tropeiro by the presence of
the pelvic girdle and pelvic fins (Fig. 10; vs. absence); and the
insertion of the first dorsal-fin basal radial anterior to neural
spine of 17th or 18th vertebrae (vs. anterior to neural spine of
19th-20th vertebrae).

anterior nostrils; pore s3 located in a longitudinal line passing
through pore s1, after posterior nostrils, and pore s6 in
interorbital space. Infraorbital sensory canal incomplete;
presence of pores i1 and i3 variable (present in 8 specimens,
including holotype and absent in 17 specimens); when
present located beside nostrils. Pore i10 located behind eye.
Pore i11 located laterally to posterior margin of eye. Postotic
pore po1 located lateral to anterior margin of opercular patch
of odontodes. Postotic pore po2 located lateral to middle of
opercular patch of odontodes. Lateral-line very short with 2
pores located above insertion of pectoral fin and just posterior
to gill openings.

Pectoral fin with distal margin truncate to slightly rounded,
I+6 rays (n = 25), first ray short and not prolonged as filament.
Pelvic fin with distal margin rounded reaching at most anterior
margin of urogenital papilla, I+4* rays (1 of 25 specimens
with I+3). Inner margin of pelvic fins very close basally and
sometimes in contact. Pelvic girdle with two basipterygia
united medially by cartilage with two elongate bifid processes
(external process and internal process) and medial process
short (Fig. 12). Pelvic splint thin, comma-shaped, and parallel
to first pelvic-fin ray. Urogenital papilla nearer tip of pelvic fin
than anal-fin origin.

fin expanded with two unsegmented rays (n = 4), II+6-8 rays (n
= 25), usually II+7*. Dorsal-fin origin located at vertical through
last third of pelvic fin. Dorsal-fin basal radials 8 (n = 4); first
inserting anterior to neural spine of 17th or 18th vertebrae.

blotches variable in size and shape over light yellow background
(Fig. 10). Blotches progressively larger and coalescent dorsally
thus forming extensive black pigmented regions with light yellow
gaps. Ventral surface of body yellow on trunk with irregular black
blotches between pelvic and anal fins and on caudal peduncle.
Dorsal and lateral surface of head black with small lighter areas;
ventral surface yellow. Pectoral, dorsal, anal and caudal fins
spotted with irregular black marks and lighter along margins.

and yellow ventrally. Larger specimens (greater than 57.4 mm
SL) with pigmentation arranged in two distinct layers; dark

blotches variable in size and shape on inner skin layer and small
black spots on outer skin layer more evident in caudal peduncle.
Distribution and ecological notes. Trichomycterus
diatropoporos is apparently endemic to the rio da Prata and
rio Turvo basins, tributaries of rio das Antas, in the laguna
dos Patos system (Fig. 8). At the type locality the rio da Prata
is a rapid flowing, wide and shallow, with an average depth of
0.5 m, with clear water, rocky bottom and large amounts of
submerged vegetation (Carvalho &amp;amp; Reis, 2011) (Fig. 9b). It is
upstream of a waterfall known as Cascata da Usina at
approximately 660 m a.s.l. At this site T. diatropoporos occurs
sympatrically with Hisonotus prata Carvalho &amp;amp; Reis, 2011,
another endemic species to the rio da Prata. The other two
localities of the paratypes are located at approximately 642 m
and 825 m a.s.l. The stomach of three c&amp;amp;s specimens
contained larvae of Diptera (Chironomidae, Simuliidae) and
nymphs of Ephemeroptera.

Remarks. The presence of the infraorbital sensory canal is
variable among the specimens of T. diatropoporos, even in
specimens from same lot and of the same size (e.g., MCP 40933).
Although characters related to the reduction of the sensory
canal have been used in defining species and even genera in
the Trichomycterinae (see Arratia, 1998), there are no additional
detectable differences in morphometrics, meristics data and
coloration pattern among specimens bearing or lacking pores
i1 and i3 of infraorbital sensory canal to justify the recognition
of two different species. Apparently, this variation in the
presence of pores i1 and i3 of infraorbital sensory canal is
unique among species of Trichomycterus. One specimen (MCP
22785) also from rio da Prata basin with counts, morphometrics,
and color pattern similar to T. diatropoporos lacks pelvic fins
and was not included in type-series. The specimen definitely is
not T. tropeiro, the species from laguna dos Patos system that
consistently lacks pelvic fins, but rather appears to be an
anomalous individual of T. diatropoporos. Among other
trichomycterines, intraspecific variation in the presence/absence
of pelvic fins is also known in Ituglanis parahybae (Eigenmann,
1918) (Costa &amp;amp; Bockmann, 1993).

Etymology. From the Greek diatropos meaning variable, and
poros meaning pore, in reference to the variation in the
presence of pores i1 and i3 of infraorbital sensory canal of the
new species. A noun in apposition.

Review of Trichomycterus from laguna dos Patos drainage234

Non-type material. All from Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul State. Rio

municipality of Igrejinha, arroio Solitária, 29º35’S 50º46’W, 10 Jun
2000, M. Moreira, R. Costa &amp;amp; U. Schulz.

Diagnosis. Trichomycterus poikilos is distinguishable from
all congeners except T. brachykechenos; T. mboycy Wosiacki
&amp;amp; Garavello, 2004; and T. naipi Wosiacki &amp;amp; Garavello, 2004
by the modal possession of I+5 pectoral-fin rays (one among
82 specimens with I+6; vs. I+6 or more pectoral-fin rays) and
the first ray of the pectoral fin not prolonged as a filament
(Figs. 13-14; vs. the first ray of the pectoral fin prolonged as
a filament). Trichomycterus poikilos is distinguished from
T. brachykechenos by having the posterior fontanel
extending from the parieto-supraoccipital to the frontals (Fig.
2c; vs. the posterior cranial fontanel restricted to the parieto-
supraoccipital), the origin of dorsal fin located at the vertical
falling between the tip of the pelvic fin and the anterior
insertion of the anal fin (Figs. 13-14; vs. the origin of dorsal
fin located at the vertical through the last third of the pelvic
fin), the maxillary barbel length (33.2-60.4% vs. 68.2-87.7%
HL), and the number of odontodes of the opercular patch
(13-17 vs. 8-11). Trichomycterus poikilos is distinguished
from T. mboycy by the pectoral-fin length (7.7-9.1% vs. 9.9-
13.8% SL) and skin color (Figs. 13-14; yellow background
vs. gray background); and from T. naipi in the number of
odontodes of the interopercular patch (20-32 vs. 12-15),
number of dorsal-fin rays (I-II+6-7 vs. I+8), and absence of a
thin unpaired dark dorsosagittal body stripe in larger

specimens (Fig. 13; vs. presence of a thin unpaired dark
dorsosagittal stripe in larger specimens). Additionally, T.
poikilos is distinguished from remaining congeners in the
laguna dos Patos system by having the origin of the dorsal
fin located at the vertical falling between the tip of the pelvic
fin and the anterior insertion of the anal fin (Figs. 13-14; vs.
at the vertical through the last third of the pelvic fin in T.
balios and T. diatropoporos); 20-23 teeth on ceratobranchial
5 (Fig. 3c; vs. 36-39 in T. balios and 12-13 in T. diatropoporos);
23-25 teeth on plate connected to pharyngobranchial 4 (Fig.
3c; vs. 35-40 in T. balios and 18-20 in T. diatropoporos);
color pattern of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of body
mottled dark brown over a light yellow background or with
three stripes with notched borders (dorsosagittal, midlateral,
and ventrolateral) (Figs. 13-14 vs. the dorsal and lateral
surfaces of body with circular black blotches variable in
size in T. balios and T. tropeiro, the lateral surface of body
with dark blotches variable in size and shape progressively
larger and coalescent dorsally thus forming extensive black
p i g m e n t e d  r e g i o n s  w i t h  l i g h t  y e l l o w  g a p s  i n  T.
diatropoporos). Trichomycterus  poikilos is further
distinguishable from T. diatropoporos by the insertion of
the first dorsal-fin basal radial anterior to the neural spine of
the 20th-22th vertebrae (vs. anterior to the neural spine of the
17th or 18th vertebrae). Trichomycterus poikilos is further
distinguishable from T. tropeiro by the presence of the
pelvic girdle and pelvic fins (Figs. 13-14; vs. absence); and
the absence of the pores i1 and i3 of the infraorbital sensory
canal (Fig. 2c; vs. presence).

Coloration in alcohol. Trichomycterus poikilos demonstrates
a variable color pattern. Most of types present the dorsum
and lateral surface of body mottled dark brown over a light
yellow background (Fig. 13 and 14a). Some specimens have a
wide unpaired dorsosagittal stripe and midlateral and
ventrolateral bilaterally paired stripes with notched borders
(Fig. 14c). Smallest specimens with midlateral stripe more
evident and ventrolateral stripe diffuse (Fig. 14d and 14e).
Ventral surface of body light yellow with diffuse and small
black spots between pectoral-fin insertion and near pelvic-
fin insertion. Area between pelvic and anal fins and caudal
peduncle mottled dark brown over light yellow background.

dorsally and yellow ventrally. Pectoral, dorsal, anal and caudal
fins spotted basally with dark pigmentation becoming
inconspicuous towards tips, and lighter along margins. Pelvic
fin unpigmented. Barbels with dark pigmentation dorsally and

with pigmentation arranged in two distinct layers; mottled
dark brown or with three stripes (dorsosagittal, midlateral,
and ventrolateral) with notched borders on inner skin layer
and small black spots on outer skin layer (Fig. 13, 14a-c).

Distribution and ecological notes. Trichomycterus poikilos
is distributed in the rio Jacuí, rio Pardo and rio Taquari-Antas
basins, in the laguna dos Patos system (Fig. 8). The species
is widely distributed in the upper portion of rio Jacuí basin,
occurring at elevations of 124 to 700 m a.s.l. One lot is from
the headwaters of rio Pardo basin, at 625 m a.s.l. In the Taquari-
Antas basin the species occurs in the upper portions of the
Carreiro, Guaporé, and Forqueta rivers, between 417 and 688
m a.s.l. The type locality is a rapid flow river with clear water,
a rocky bottom and submerged vegetation (Fig. 9c), located
at approximately 405 m a.s.l. At this site the specimens were
associated with submerged vegetation and collected with
Ancistrus brevipinnis (Regan, 1904), Eurycheilichthys
limulus Reis &amp;amp; Schaefer, 1998, and Rineloricaria cadeae
(Hensel, 1868). The stomach of six c&amp;amp;s specimens contained
aquatic larvae of Diptera (Simuliidae) and Lepidoptera; and
nymphs of the Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera.

Remarks. Trichomycterus poikilos demonstrates intraspecific
ontogenetic color pattern variation. Although Bockmann &amp;amp;
Sazima (2004) considered the body pigmentation pattern highly
conserved in known species of Trichomycterus, a intraspecific
variation in coloration is present in T. caipora Lima, Lazzarotto
&amp;amp; Costa, 2008 (Lima et al., 2008), in T. iheringi (Eigenmann,
1917) associated to body size and microhabitat preference (da
Silva et al., 2010), and in T. santanderensis Castellanos-
Morales, 2007. The ontogenetic variation in T. poikilos is clear
in lot UFRGS 14992 (six specimens with 40.5-92.5 mm SL), in
which the smallest specimens have one obvious midlateral
stripe on the body that gradually become indistinguishable in
the largest specimens (Fig. 14). This ontogenetic variation is
not observed in all samples. In other lots all specimens have a
mottled pattern (UFRGS 14500, 11 specimens with 32.0-74.5 mm
SL) regardless of body size. Besides coloration no additional
differences were found between these populations that allow
us to separate them and ontogenetic variation in the color
pattern seems to appear only in some populations.

The color pattern of some specimens of T. poikilos – lateral
surface of body with widened stripes – is very similar to T.
itatiayae Miranda Ribeiro, 1906; T. naipi; T. pauciradiatus
Alencar &amp;amp; Costa, 2006; T. perkos, and T. reinhardti (Eigenmann,
1917) (Barbosa &amp;amp; Costa, 2008; Wosiacki &amp;amp; Garavello, 2004;
Alencar &amp;amp; Costa, 2006; Datovo et al., 2012; Eigenmann, 1917),
but differs from these by other characters (see diagnosis). The
midlateral stripe is present in juveniles of other species of
Trichomycteridae, but absent in adults (see Datovo et al., 2012).

Seven specimens from the rio do Sinos basin are poorly
preserved and were not measured or counted (MCP 26148),
however a mottled color pattern over a light yellow
background is present in all specimens, and one c&amp;amp;s specimen
possesses the lower jaw with blunt teeth which leads us to
believe it to be T. poikilos.

Etymology. From the Greek poikilos meaning variegated,
varicolored, in reference to the intraspecific color pattern
variation of the new species. An adjective.

from all its congeners except T. mboycy, T. naipi, and T.
poikilos by the modal possession of I+5 pectoral-fin rays
(one among 15 specimens with I+6; vs. I+6 or more pectoral-
fin rays) and the first ray of the pectoral fin not prolonged
as a filament (Fig. 15; vs. first ray of the pectoral fin prolonged
as a filament). Trichomycterus brachykechenos is further
distinguishable from T. mboycy and T. naipi by the color
pattern of the dorsal and lateral surface of body of a densely
mottled dark brown over a light yellow background (Fig. 15;
vs. the lateral surface of body with small spots in T. mboycy;
the lateral surface of body with three dark longitudinal
stripes in T. naipi); the maxillary barbel length (68.2-87.7%
vs. 50.3-63% HL in T. mboycy; 34.1-68.2% HL in T. naipi).
Additionally, T. brachykechenos is distinguished from the
remaining congeners in the laguna dos Patos system by the
number of odontodes on the opercular patch (8-11 vs. 13 or
more in T. balios, T. diatropoporos, T. poikilos, and T.
tropeiro) and the maxillary barbel length (68.2-87.7% vs. 37.8-
66.6% HL in T. balios; 38.3-53.9% HL in T. diatropoporos;
33.2-60.4% HL in T. poikilos).

(depth less to 1 m) with fast current and rapids, a distinct
slope, clear waters, a substrate consisting mainly of large
rocks, and conserved riparian vegetation (Fig. 9d). The
type locality is located at elevation of approximately 109 m
a.s.l. and the two other type lots were from 169 m and 266
m a.s.l. The stomach contents of one c&amp;amp;s specimen
contained larvae of the Chironomidae (Diptera) and pupa
of the Diptera.

Remarks. The cranial fontanel demonstrates several
m o d i f i c a t i o n s  i n  t h e  T r i c h o m y c t e r i d a e .  T h e  b a s a l
subfamilies Copionodontinae and Trichogeninae possess
a completely open anterior cranial fontanel extended as a
long slit from the mesethmoid to the epiphyseal bar (de
Pinna, 1992a). Ituglanis has only the posterior cranial
fontanel which is reduced to a small round opening
restricted to the parieto-supraoccipital (Costa &amp;amp; Bockmann,
1993) or is even absent in I. macunaima Datovo &amp;amp; Landim,

2005; I. mambai Bichuette &amp;amp; Trajano, 2008; and some I.
epikarsticus Bichuette &amp;amp; Trajano, 2004 (Datovo &amp;amp; Landim,
2005; Bichuette &amp;amp; Trajano, 2008, 2004, respectively). A
completely closure of cranial fontanels also occurs in the
s u b f a m i l i e s  G l a n a p t e r y g i n a e ,  S t e g o p h i l i n a e ,  a n d
Vandelliinae (Baskin, 1973). Bockmann et al. (2004)
identified the anterior cranial fontanel partially or
completely closed as a derived feature that corroborates
the monophyly of clade 2 (sensu de Pinna 1992a, 1998).

In the Trichomycterus species the cranial fontanel is
normally divided in two openings separated by epiphyseal
bar: the anterior fontanel which is a small rounded opening
situated between frontals, and the posterior fontanel which
is long and narrow extending from posterior portion of frontals
to parieto-supraoccipital. A reduced cranial fontanel is present
in at least other three species of the genus: T. cachiraensis
Ardila Rodríguez, 2008, T. sketi Castellanos-Morales, 2011
from Colombia, and T. megantoni from Peru.

Trichomycterus cachiraensis possess the posterior cranial
fontanel reduced to a small round opening restricted to the
parieto-supraoccipital – condition identical to that reported
for Ituglanis (Costa &amp;amp; Bockmann, 1993) – and the anterior
cranial fontanel variable (Ardila Rodríguez, 2008: fig. 4).
Trichomycterus sketi has three openings with triangle shape:
the anterior cranial fontanel between frontals, and the
posterior cranial fontanel divided in one orifice between
frontals and the other in the parieto-supraoccipital
(Castellanos-Morales, 2010: fig. 3).

The cranial fontanel of Trichomycterus megantoni is
illustrated and described as “reduced between frontals and
supraoccipital” (Fernández &amp;amp; Chuquihuamaní, 2007: fig.
3), a shape very similar to T. brachykechenos, which is
absent or restricted to a very small opening anteriorly and
elongate and restricted to the parieto-supraoccipital
posteriorly (Fig. 2d). Fernández &amp;amp; Chuquihuamaní (2007)
stated that the peculiar cranial fontanel of Trichomycterus
megantoni is probably an autopomorphy, but cannot be
ascertained as unique in Trichomycterinae because some
species are rare or do not have their anatomy examined.
Indeed, the discovery of T. brachykechenos confirms that
t h e  c o n d i t i o n  i s  n o t  u n i q u e  i n  t h e  s u b f a m i l y
Trichomycterinae.

Nevertheless, the several differences between the two
species (see diagnosis) lead us to believe that they are not
closely related and that this reduction is homoplastic
among the two species. It reinforces the assumption of
Fernández &amp;amp; Chuquihuamaní (2007) that cranial fontanel
reduction must be interpreted as homoplastic among
Trichomycterus species, Ituglanis, glanapterygines and
stegophilines, according to the current understanding of
the trichomycterid phylogeny.

Etymology. From the Greek brachys meaning short, and
kechenos meaning gap, opening, in reference to the short
posterior cranial fontanel of the new species. A name in
apposition.

Discussion

The family Trichomycteridae is currently composed of
eight subfamilies: Copionodontinae, Trichogeninae,
Trichomycterinae, Tridentinae, Stegophilinae, Vandelliinae,
Sarcoglanidinae, and Glanapteryginae. The phylogenetic
relationships within the family Trichomycteridae have been
well studied (e.g., Baskin, 1973; de Pinna, 1989, 1992a; Arratia,
1990; Costa &amp;amp; Bockmann, 1993) based mainly in osteological
characters and was summarized in de Pinna (1998). Posteriorly,
other contributions were available (Wosiacki, 2002; Bockmann,
et al., 2004) and recently, the relationships within the family
Trichomycteridae were evaluated based on dorsolateral head
muscles by Datovo &amp;amp; Bockmann (2010).

The four new species present 10 of 11 synapomorphies
that support the clade 2 (sensu de Pinna, 1998 and updated in
Bockmann, et al., 2004), which is formed by all trichomycterids
except Copionodontinae and Trichogeninae: sphenotic,
prootic, and pterosphenoid fused; incomplete infraorbital
branch of laterosensory canal system; Weberian capsule with
a small lateral opening, much smaller than its lateral profile;
interhyal absent; five or fewer pelvic-fin rays; the anterior
cranial fontanel partially or completely closed; a dorsal caudal-
fin plate with six or fewer rays; a ventral caudal-fin plate with
eight or fewer rays; a dorsal caudal-fin lobe with five or fewer
branched rays; and a ventral caudal-fin lobe with six or fewer
branched rays. Two other synapomorphies reported for this
clade were not evaluated in the current study: the presence
of the protractor operculi muscle (de Pinna, 1992a, 1998;
Datovo &amp;amp; Bockmann, 2010) and the fibers of the levator
operculi being posterodorsally directed towards its origin
(Datovo &amp;amp; Bockmann, 2010).

The monophyly of Trichomycterinae was proposed by
Arratia (1990) based on four putative synapomorphies, but
these were demonstrated invalid by Datovo &amp;amp; Bockmann
(2010), even with the exclusion of Trichomycterus hasemani

(Eigenmann, 1914), and T. johnsoni (Fowler, 1932). These two
species, along with T. anhanga, are more closely related to
other subfamilies of Trichomycteridae (de Pinna, 1989;
Wosiacki, 2002; Dutra et al., 2012). The new species, however,
lack the diagnostic features of the subfamilies Tridentinae,
Stegophilinae, Vandelliinae, Sarcoglanidinae, and
Glanapteryginae (so-called TSVSG clade by Costa &amp;amp;
Bockmann, 1993; de Pinna, 1998, Datovo &amp;amp; Bockmann, 2010)
and the trichomycterine genera Bullockia, Eremophilus,
Hatcheria, Rhizosomichthys, Scleronema, and Silvinichthys
(cf. Eigenmann, 1918; Arratia et al., 1978; Arratia, 1990, 1998;
Wosiacki, 2002). The new species also lack the three
synapomorphies proposed by Costa &amp;amp; Bockmann (1993) for
the genus Ituglanis – except Trichomycterus
brachykechenos (discussed below) – which leads us to
include them in the non-monophyletic genus Trichomycterus
(de Pinna, 1989, 1998; Datovo &amp;amp; Bockmann, 2010).

In the few studies that attempted to elucidate the
relationships among the species of Trichomycterus of south
and southern of Brazil, Wosiacki &amp;amp; de Pinna (2008) recognized
a monophyletic group formed by the species endemic to the
rio Iguaçu basin [T. crassicaudatus Wosiacki &amp;amp; de Pinna,
2008; T. igobi Wosiacki &amp;amp; de Pinna, 2008, and T. stawiarski
(Miranda Ribeiro, 1968)] based in three putative
synapomorphies: the procurrent caudal-fin rays thickly
ossified and rigid, the dorsal procurrent rays extend for a
long portion of the caudal peduncle, stretching over the tips
of at least ten neural spines, and 10-11 branchiostegal rays.
Datovo et al. (2012) confirmed the validity of these characters
and tentatively proposed another species from rio Paraná
basin, Trichomycterus perkos, as the sister-group of the clade
T. crassicaudatus, T. igobi, and T. stawiarski based on the
share of the third character (10-11 branchiostegal rays).
However, none of these three features are present in the
species described herein from the laguna dos Patos system.

Another attempt to define a monophyletic group within
Trichomycterinae is the case of Trichomycterus brasiliensis
species-complex, proposed initially by Costa (1992) based in
the proximity of the bases of pelvic fins, distal border of
caudal fin rounded, and irregular confluent marks on lateral
surface of body. This species-complex was redefined by
Barbosa &amp;amp; Costa (2003) mentioning three morphometric
synapomorphies, latter contested by Bockmann &amp;amp; Sazima
(2004) due the lack of clear landmarks for precise comparisons.
Thus, the T. brasiliensis species-complex was re-diagnosed
based on the presence of four putatively derived traits: (1)
the large, horizontally-elongate and well-defined blotches in
four longitudinal rows of deeper-lying pigmentation on the
trunk; (2) the pectoral fin with I+5-6 rays; (3) a separation of
the anterior and posterior cranial fontanels by the primordial
epiphyseal cartilaginous bar being present only in larger
specimens; (4) and the pelvic-fin bases very close to each
other, sometimes in contact (Bockmann &amp;amp; Sazima, 2004). More
recently, Barbosa &amp;amp; Costa (2010) rejected three of these
diagnostic features (characters 1, 2, and 4) from Bockmann &amp;amp;
Sazima (2004) due to the presence of pelvic-fin bases very



Review of Trichomycterus from laguna dos Patos drainage242

close to each other and of I+5-6 pectoral-fin rays in other
species of Trichomycterus not included in the group, as well
as due to the impossibility to determine accurately the number
of longitudinal rows of blotches that are greatly irregular in
their arrangement. As a consequence, Barbosa &amp;amp; Costa (2010)
redefined again the T. brasiliensis species-complex based on
a single diagnostic feature: the oblique disposition of the
opercular odontodes. The four species herein described
present some diagnostic characters listed in these hypotheses
(e.g., pelvic-fin bases very close to each other and I+5-6
pectoral-fin rays), but the constant changes in the definition
of T. brasiliensis species-complex and the unavailable
osteological data from all species of Trichomycterus make
these hypotheses questionable and to date not consistently
demonstrated.

The species of Trichomycterus from laguna dos Patos
system are clearly distinguishable from most congeners by
the lower number of pectoral-fin rays (modally I+5 in T.
brachykechenos and T. poikilos; modally I+6 in T. balios;
and I+6 in T. diatropoporos, and T. tropeiro) and by the first
pectoral-fin ray not prolonged as a filament. The combination
of these two characters is uncommon in valid species of
Trichomycterus from southern and southeastern Brazil, being
present only in T. davisi, T. mboycy, T. naipi, T. papilliferus, T.
perkos, T. plumbeus and T. tropeiro. All these species are
restricted to the rio Iguaçu drainage, except for T. davisi that
also occurs in the upper rio Paraná and rio Ribeira do Iguape
drainages, T. perkos that is distributed in the rio Uruguay and
rio Paranapanema drainages, and T. tropeiro which is
restricted to the laguna dos Patos system. Two additional
undescribed species (see comparative material) from rio
Uruguay also possess the combination of these two
characters.

Costa &amp;amp; Bockmann (1993) suggest that Ituglanis and
Scleronema are closely related to TSVSG clade based in two
synapomorphies (reduction of the interopercular patch of
odontodes and urohyal thin and elongate), and de Pinna (1998)
reinforced the monophyly of this clade based on shared three
or fewer abdominal vertebrae by its members. However,
Datovo &amp;amp; Bockmann (2010) listed a unique derived character
shared by at least five genera of the subfamily
Trichomycterinae (Bullockia, Hatcheria, Ituglanis,
Scleronema and Trichomycterus), the posterior portion of
the levator internus 4 originating from the dorsal face of the
posttemporo-supracleithrum, and contested the utility of the
characters that corroborated the monophyly of the clade
Scleronema + Ituglanis + TSVSG (Costa &amp;amp; Bockmann, 1993;
de Pinna, 1998). According to Datovo &amp;amp; Bockmann (2010),
the reduction of the interopercular patch of odontodes and
the thinness and elongation of urohyal lateral processes is
present in many other trichomycterines (e.g., Trichomycterus
stawiarski and Silvinichthys bortayro Fernández &amp;amp; de Pinna,
2005) and seem to be developed to varying degrees with a
continuum of intermediate states between the more extreme
conditions. Trichomycterus balios, T. diatropoporos, and T.
poikilos present the urohyal with lateral processes with wide

bases and decreasing in width distally with rounded tips, but
T. brachykechenos possesses the lateral processes of urohyal
thin and elongate with pointed tips (Fig. 5), corroborating the
statements of Datovo &amp;amp; Bockmann (2010).

Trichomycterus brachykechenos has one of three
synapomorphies proposed by Costa &amp;amp; Bockmann (1993) for
the genus Ituglanis: the anterior portion of the sphenotic
directed anteriorly (Fig. 2d). The other two, autopalatine with
a deep concavity on the medial margin and the parieto-
supraoccipital fontanel (= posterior cranial fontanel) reduced
to a small round orifice, are not present in the new species
(Fig. 16 and Fig. 2d, respectively). However, the shape of
posterior cranial fontanel in T. brachykechenos is intermediary
between the typical Ituglanis and the basal trichomycterids,
which possess a tiny and wide posterior cranial fontanel,
respectively (Fig. 2d, see remarks). Thus, according to the
hypothesis of Datovo &amp;amp; Bockmann (2010) and the two
characters present in T. brachykechenos – pattern of the
posterior cranial fontanel added to anterior portion of the
sphenotic directed anteriorly – may indicate a possible
relationship with Ituglanis.

Color Pattern. Trichomycterus balios, T. diatropoporos, and
T. poikilos shares the two distinct layers of pigmentation in
the skin of large specimens as reported for T. castroi by de
Pinna (1992b), T. brasiliensis, T. iheringi, T. maracaya, T.
mimonha, T. potschi, and undescribed species of the T.
brasiliensis complex by Bockmann &amp;amp; Sazima (2004), and T.
crassicaudatus, T. diabolus, T. giganteus, T. igobi, T. perkos,
T. stawiarski, and T. tropeiro by Datovo et al. (2012). Among
the species from laguna dos Patos system, only
Trichomycterus brachykechenos lacks the two distinct layers.
The distribution of these patterns across Trichomycterus
species, however, is mostly unknown because it is missing in
most species descriptions or because it is difficult to recognize
the two skin layers in specimens preserved for a long period
of time (Datovo et al., 2012).

Several species of Trichomycterus have the deeper skin
layer (= inner skin layer) usually composed of larger blotches
and spots, formed by densely grouped chromatophores
(Bockmann &amp;amp; Sazima, 2004). Among the species from laguna
dos Patos system, Trichomycterus balios, T. diatropoporos,
and T. tropeiro share this pattern of the inner skin layer. Both
T. balios and T. tropeiro possess black circular blotches
variable in size on the dorsal and lateral surface of body over
a lighter background, while T. diatropoporos has black
blotches variable in size and shape coalescent dorsally on a
lighter background.

The other species from laguna dos Patos system with two
distinct layers of pigmentation presents the inner skin layer
formed by stripes in some specimens, condition similar to
that of T. perkos from the La Plata drainage.

Bockmann &amp;amp; Sazima (2004) cited for T. brasiliensis species
complex the superficial skin layer (= outer skin layer) formed
by chromatophores gradually denser and organized in well-
defined patches in progressively larger specimens, sometimes



J. Ferrer &amp;amp; L. R. Malabarba 243

covering so intensely that hides the deeper skin layer
(Bockmann &amp;amp; Sazima, 2004: fig. 11b). This superficial
pigmentation in the largest specimens is distinct from that
observed in Trichomycterus balios, T. diatropoporos, and T.
poikilos, which is composed by small spots and similar to the
“freckled” pattern reported to Trichomycterus perkos in
Datovo et al. (2012), as well as for T. brasiliensis, T. castroi, T.
crassicaudatus, T. diabolus, T. giganteus, T. igobi, T.
maracaya, T. mimonha, T. stawiarski, and T. tropeiro.

Geographic distribution. The review of a large number of
lots of the Trichomycteridae collected in practically all portions
of laguna dos Patos system revealed that Trichomycterus is
restricted to the northern portion of that basin along the middle
and upper stretches of the rio Jacuí and middle and upper
stretches of its large tributaries, the rio do Sinos, rio Caí, rio
Taquari-Antas, and rio Pardo (Fig. 8). The few lots of
Trichomycterus listed in fish collections as having originated
in the southern portion of the laguna dos Patos system proved
to be Ituglanis, a genus which has an external morphology
very similar to Trichomycterus.

The analysis of comparative material from adjacent
drainages to the north and northeast of laguna dos Patos
system (rio Uruguay, rio Tramandaí, and rio Mampituba
basins) allow us to propose that three among the four new
species are endemic to the laguna dos Patos system, excepting
T. balios, which occurs also in the headwaters of rio
Mampituba. However, their degree of endemism is variable.
Trichomycterus balios is distributed in the upper courses of
rio das Antas, rio Caí, and rio Mampituba basins; T. poikilos
is widely distributed in the upper courses of the rio Jacuí
basin and tributaries of the rio the Taquari-Antas; T.
brachykechenos and T. diatropoporos are known only from
few localities in the rio dos Sinos and the rio da Prata basin
respectively. Trichomycterus tropeiro is also endemic to the
laguna dos Patos drainage and has a very restricted range,
occurring only in headwaters of rio das Antas (Ferrer &amp;amp;
Malabarba, 2011). Endemism and restricted ranges seem typical
among species of Trichomycterus, which is the dominant
genus in the compilation of species with restricted-ranges in
Nogueira et al. (2010), with 45 species.

The species of Trichomycterus from the laguna dos Patos
system usually are distributed in headwaters or upper courses
and may demonstrate disjoint distributions in the same basin.
Both T. tropeiro and T. balios are found in the rio das Antas,
but the first species is known only from localities above 1000
m a.s.l (Ferrer &amp;amp; Malabarba, 2011), while the second occurs in
the lower portions between 681 m and 941 m a.s.l. The same
distribution pattern is observed in two characid species of
the genus Astyanax described from the rio das Antas basin,
A. brachypterygium occurring above 1100 m a.s.l. and A.
cremnobates restricted to altitudes ranging from 800 to 1000
m a.s.l. (Bertaco &amp;amp; Malabarba, 2001).

Besides both T. balios and T. poikilos occur in the rio
Taquari-Antas drainage, they also show disjoint distributions.
Trichomycterus balios occurs to the East, in the rio da Prata,

a tributary in the right margin of the rio das Antas, and
tributaries of the rio das Antas above the mouth of the rio da
Prata in both right and left margins. Trichomycterus poikilos
occurs to the West in the rio Carreiro, rio Guaporé and rio
Forqueta, all right margin tributaries of the rio Taquari-Antas,
below the rio da Prata, but is also widely distributed in the
upper tributaries of the rio Jacuí basin that are geographically
close to the rio Taquari-Antas tributaries (Fig. 8). The
occurrence of T. poikilos in close proximity in the upper
portions of the tributaries of two sub-drainages (rio Taquari-
Antas and upper rio Jacuí) may indicate headwater capture
events among these small tributaries.

Trichomycterus diatropoporos is endemic to the rio da
Prata basin and occurs sympatrically with Hisonotus prata
and an undescribed species of Eurycheilichthys, also
endemic to the upper course of the rio da Prata (Carvalho &amp;amp;
Reis, 2011). The mountain relief on which the Taquari drainage
flows was considered responsible for dividing species
distribution in that drainage, as exemplified by H. prata and
the undescribed species of Eurycheilichthys (Carvalho &amp;amp;
Reis, 2011), and it seems to be also correlated to the restricted
distribution range of T. diatropoporos.

Trichomycterus brachykechenos is apparently endemic
to the upper course of the rio do Sinos. One sample tentatively
identified as T. poikilos was found in other stretch of the
upper basin of the rio dos Sinos, but not syntopic with T.
brachykechenos.

This study revealed an astonishing undescribed diversity
of Trichomycterus in a relatively small region with four
undescribed species, along with one species recently
described in 2011. We expect that the revision of other
understudied basins in southern Brazil will reveal new and
undescribed species of Trichomycterus.
