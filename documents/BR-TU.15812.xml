resumo 
 

 

Os sapais são ecossistemas marinhos altamente produtivos que 
frequentemente recebem contaminantes de natureza antropogénica. A Ria de 
Aveiro encontra-se no noroeste de Portugal e contém numerosos sapais. 
Halimione portulacoides é um dos halófitos mais importantes em sapais 
Europeus e tem sido amplamente estudada devido ao seu potencial para ser 
usada em fins de fitorremediação, e como bioindicador de contaminação de 
sedimentos. Bactérias endofíticas podem apresentar capacidade promotora do 
crescimento de plantas (PCP), quer diretamente por produção de fito-
hormonas e aquisição de nutrientes, quer indiretamente via competição com 
fitopatogenos. No presente trabalho, a diversidade de bactérias endofíticas da 
planta de sapal H. portulacoides da Ria de Aveiro é explorada extensivamente.  
 
Isolados de bactérias endofíticas foram obtidos e caracterizados quanto à sua 
taxonomia, capacidade de produzir enzimas e características PCP. As 
características mais observadas foram atividade celulolítica, xilanolítica e 
desaminase de 1-aminociclopropano-1-carboxilato, e a produção da auxina 
ácido indol-3-acético. Os resultados revelaram um enorme potencial da 
coleção para PCP in vitro e in vivo.  
 
A coleção de isolados foi também explorada para procurar diversidade não 
descrita. Como resultado, dez novas espécies de bactérias foram amplamente 
caracterizadas e descritas: Microbacterium diaminobutyricum, 
Saccharospirillum correiae, Altererythrobacter halimionae, Altererythrobacter 
endophyticus, Zunongwangia endophytica, Salinicola halimionae, Salinicola 
aestuarina, Salinicola endophytica, Salinicola halophytica e Salinicola lusitana. 
Consequentemente, o presente trabalho expôs a endosfera de H. 
portulacoides como um foco de diversidade bacteriana desconhecida.  
 
A composição taxonómica da comunidade endofítica foi averiguada via 
sequenciação do gene 16S rRNA da coleção de isolados, e mais 
profundamente com a utilização de sequenciação de alto rendimento 
independente do cultivo. A última abordagem revelou cinco filos principais: 
Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes e Firmicutes. 
Destes, apenas Planctomycetes não foi obtido na coleção de isolados. As 
comunidades diferiram de acordo com o local (no ensaio dependente do 
cultivo, para locais contaminados e não-contaminado) e tecido (em ambos os 
ensaios) de amostragem. As principais famílias obtidas no endofitoma nuclear 
foram Oceanospirillaceae em tecidos de parte aérea, e Enterobacteriaceae e 
Kiloniellaceae em tecidos de raiz.  
 
O trabalho apresentado providenciou uma compreensão profunda das 
bactérias endofíticas presentes no halófito H. portulacoides, e expôs o seu 
potencial como foco de bactérias não descritas e bactérias promotoras do 
crescimento de plantas.

abstract 
 

 

Salt marshes are highly productive marine ecosystems that often act as a sink 
for contaminants of anthropogenic nature. The Ria de Aveiro lagoon is located 
in the north-west of Portugal and comprises numerous salt marshes. Halimione 
portulacoides is one of the most important halophytes in European salt 
marshes and has been widely researched for its potential for phytoremediation, 
and as a bioindicator of sediment contamination. Endophytic bacteria can 
present plant growth promotion (PGP) abilities, either directly by production of 
phytohormones and nutrient uptake, or indirectly via competition with 
phytopathogens. In the present work, the diversity of endophytic bacteria from 
the salt marsh plant H. portulacoides from Ria de Aveiro is extensively 
explored.  
 
Endophytic bacterial isolates were obtained and characterized for their 
taxonomy, ability to produce specific enzymes and PGP traits. The most 
observed traits were cellulolytic, xylanolytic and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-
carboxylate deaminase activities, and the production of the auxin indol-3-acetic 
acid. The results revealed an enormous potential of the collection for in vitro 
and in vivo PGP.  
 
The collection of isolates was also explored for undescribed diversity. As a 
result, ten novel bacterial species were thoroughly characterized and 
described: Microbacterium diaminobutyricum, Saccharospirillum correiae, 
Altererythrobacter halimionae, Altererythrobacter endophyticus, Zunongwangia 
endophytica, Salinicola halimionae, Salinicola aestuarina, Salinicola 
endophytica, Salinicola halophytica and Salinicola lusitana. Consequently, the 
present work exposes the endosphere of H. portulacoides as a hotspot of 
unknown bacterial diversity. 
 
The taxonomic composition of the endophytic community was assessed via 
16S rRNA gene sequencing of the isolate collection, and with more depth using 
culture-independent high-throughput sequencing. The latter approach revealed 
five main phyla: Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes 
and Firmicutes. From these, only Planctomycetes was not obtained in the 
isolate collection. The communities differed according to sampling site (for the 
culture-dependent assay, for contaminated and non-contaminated sites) and 
tissue (in both assays). The main families found in the core endophytome were 
Oceanospirillaceae for aboveground tissues, and Enterobacteriaceae and 
Kiloniellaceae for belowground tissues.  
 
The present work provided a deep understanding of the endophytic bacteria 
present in the halophyte H. portulacoides, and exposed its potential as a 
hotspot of undescribed bacteria and plant growth promoting bacteria.

1.1 Plant species: Halimione portulacoides 

Halimione portulacoides (L.) Aellen (basonym Atriplex portulacoides, synonym Obione 

portulacoides; The International Plant Names Index, 2012), common name sea purslane, is an 

eudicot from the order Caryophyllales, family Amaranthaceae, sub-family Chenopodioideae. This 

C3 evergreen small shrub can reach 80 cm in height, can be found in acid, neutral and basic soils, 

and can grow with little or no shade conditions (Anjum et al., 2014). Leaves from this plant can be 

used for human consumption, either uncooked in salads, or cooked as a potherb, and its use for 

asthma treatment has been reported (Everest &amp;amp; Ozturk, 2005). With a world wide distribution, H. 

portulacoides is the most abundant, and one of the most productive species in ungrazed European 

salt marshes (Bouchard et al., 1998; Anjum et al., 2014).  

 

Halophytes are often considered for salt marsh phytoremediation of metals and other 

contaminants, since they represent a relatively inexpensive option for storing contaminants in their 

biomass (Figueira et al., 2012). In addition to H. portulacoides, other halophytes such as Spartina 

alterniflora, Juncus maritimus, and Phragmites australis have been considered for their 

phytoremediation potential (Williams et al., 1994; Figueira et al., 2012; Amari et al., 2017). The use 

of H. portulacoides in phytoremediation of contaminated sediments has been largely researched in 

several Portuguese marshes, such as Ria de Aveiro, Tagus, Sado, and Guadiana marshes (Canário et 

al., 2007). 

The potential for phytoremediation of H. portulacoides has been particularly explored for mercury 

(Hg) contaminated sediments. In fact, the ability of this halophyte to be a biomonitor for Hg 

contamination has been explored, since this halophyte is able to give quantitative information 

regarding Hg contamination levels in the sediments (Válega et al., 2008a). Hg is accumulated in 

belowground (BG) tissues of the halophyte, and its concentration in aboveground (AG) tissues is 

comparatively low. Some reasons have been given for this difference in Hg content in both tissues: 

(i) Hg mobility occurs primarily between the sediment and BG tissues, and there is a poor 

translocation of this metal from BG to AG tissues (Canário et al., 2007; Válega et al., 2008b; Caçador 

et al., 2009; Canário et al., 2017), (ii) there is a constant renovation of leaves thus keeping metal 

content low at any given moment (Válega et al., 2008a), (iii) there is low accumulation in stems 

since they are transport and not storage organs (Válega et al., 2008a), (iv) leaves of the halophyte 

are able to exude Hg0 from the AG tissues to the atmosphere (Canário et al., 2017). Moreover, 

retaining metals in the BG tissues may be a strategy to protect the more sensitive AG tissues from 



12 
 

the effects of the toxic metals (Lozano-Rodriguez et al., 1997). The accumulation of Hg in the BG 

tissues causes the halophyte to act as a sink for the toxic element, however, Hg translocation from 

BG to AG tissues, albeit low, may act as a potential Hg source in salt marshes (Anjum et al., 2011).  

The discrepancy in metal accumulation in the different plant tissues has also been observed for 

other metals: copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd; Caçador et al., 2009). For cobalt (Co), however, 

it was observed that up to 50 % of the total Co content was contained in AG tissues (Caçador et al., 

2009). Seasonal variation for Cu, Zn, Cd and Co accumulation was observed in AG tissues, but not 

in BG tissues (Caçador et al., 2009). Seasonality was also verified for Hg accumulation in H. 

portulacoides (Anjum et al., 2011). 

Metal tolerance in H. portulacoides may be associated with the accumulation of these toxic 

elements in the cell walls in both BG and AG tissues, preventing the contaminants to exert their 

effects in the cytoplasm (Válega et al., 2009). Sequestration of Hg into vacuoles via cysteine-rich 

peptides is another mechanism for metal tolerance exhibited by salt marsh plants (Canário et al., 

2007 and references therein). Recently, phytochelatins have been suggested to have a role in 

tolerance to arsenic (As), Zn and lead (Pb) in salt marsh plants under natural conditions (Negrin et 

al., 2017). 

 

The ability for H. portulacoides to remediate sediments contaminated with other types of 

contaminants has also been examined, namely for hydrocarbons (Almeida et al., 2008; Couto et al., 

2011) and tributyltin (Carvalho et al., 2010). Phytoremediation of Cu by salt marsh plants including 

H. portulacoides is affected by the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Almeida et al., 

2008) and by whether the metal is in ionic or nanoparticle (NP) form (Andreotti et al., 2015; 

Fernandes et al., 2016). The NP form may result in aggregates which lead to lower Cu accumulation, 

thus reducing metal availability and uptake. Consequently, the phytoremediation potential is 

diminished (Fernandes et al., 2016). These additional contaminants and form of contaminant 

should be taken into account when analyzing the potential for phytoremediation in contaminated 

sediments.

1.2 Study area: Ria de Aveiro and Laranjo Bay 

Salt marshes are highly productive estuarine ecosystems characterized by high salinity and 

periodical flooding, providing conditions for specialized colonization. In addition to these restrictive 

conditions, salt marshes are often affected by anthropogenic activities and are considered a sink 

for contaminants, including metals (reviewed in Williams et al., 1994). 

The Ria de Aveiro lagoon, located in the northwest coast of Portugal alongside the Atlantic Ocean, 

is 45 km long and 10 km wide, and contains salt marshes that are subjected to semi-diurnal tides 

(Válega et al., 2008b). This shallow lagoon contains several channels and extensive inter-tidal areas 

and is connected to the Atlantic Ocean through a narrow opening known as Barra de Aveiro (Lopes 

et al., 2001; Anjum et al., 2014).  

 

For over four decades (1950-1994), an industrial complex in Estarreja discharged contaminant-

heavy effluents to the Ria de Aveiro lagoon, through a remote branch of the lagoon that ends at 

the Laranjo Bay. In 1994, the reduction of contaminated discharges was achieved with changes on 

production processes, installation of a recovery plant, a wastewater treatment plant, and a landfill 

for solid waste and contaminated sediments (Costa and Jesus-Rydin, 2001; Pereira et al., 1998b). 

Main contaminants present in the effluents discharged to Laranjo Bay included aniline, benzene, 

monochlorobenzene, mononitrobenzene, As, Hg, Zn and Pb. Those present in higher 

concentrations were As, Hg, Pb and Zn, where As and Hg were the most severe and spread (Costa 

and Jesus-Rydin, 2001). Notwithstanding the diversity of contaminants present in Laranjo Bay, 

particular attention has been given to Hg and its contents in different elements of the ecosystem. 

No biological function is known for Hg, and it is considered a priority by the European Water 

Framwork Directive (www.http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-framework) and on a 

global scale, since events of bioconcentration, bioaccumulation and biomagnification can be 

observed when this contaminant is present in waters (Pereira et al., 2009 and references therein).  

 

The Laranjo Bay is a lagoon connected to the Ria de Aveiro through a narrow channel. The sediment 

at Laranjo Bay is a mixture of sand and mud containing 35-75 % of fine particles (Válega et al., 

2008b), and exhibits a marked north-south distribution of cohesive sediments. The northern area 

contains more cohesive sediments which allow for an easier adsorption of metallic elements, 

resulting in the formation of stable metal-sediment complexes (Lopes et al., 2001).  



14 
 

The Hg content of the water column is low (10 to 37 pmol dm-3) in comparison with pore waters in 

the sediments (17 to 188 pmol dm-3). The stability of the complexes formed between the metal and 

the sediments prevents the enrichment of the water column (Ramalhosa et al., 2006). Analysis of 

the vertical profiles of Laranjo Bay sediments revealed the lowest Hg content at the core bottom, 

an increase and peak of Hg contents in layers at 10 to 25 cm, and a decrease toward the surface 

sediments. These profiles reflect a pre-industrial period, followed by the contaminant-heavy 

discharges, and the more recent reduction of intake of industrial contaminants (Pereira et al., 

1998a; Pereira et al., 1998b Válega et al., 2008b). Analysis of Hg content in the water column and 

in the sediments show that the highest concentrations are observed closest to the source of the 

contamination, and a contamination gradient is observed inside the lagoon (Pereira et al., 1998b; 

Ramalhosa et al., 2006; Válega et al., 2009).  

 

In 1998 it was estimated that a 33 ton load of Hg was present in the Ria de Aveiro lagoon, and that 

most of this load was confined to the Estarreja Channel and Laranjo Bay: approximately 27 ton in 

less than 4 % of the Ria de Aveiro area (Pereira et al., 1998a; Pereira et al., 1998b). There is evidence 

that Hg is continuously being exported from the Laranjo Bay, especially through tidal forces by 

ressuspension of the contaminated sediments in the water column (Pereira et al., 1998b; Lopes et 

al., 2001). The surface layers of the sediments are more easily eroded and contaminants transferred 

to the water column present a potential risk for spread of the contamination throughout the 

network of the Ria de Aveiro (Lopes et al., 2001; Pato et al., 2008b). Deeper layers of sediments, 

which are richer in contaminant content, are not as easily eroded to the water column, unless 

events such as floods and storms are observed. These high evergy phenomena are able to 

ressuspend Hg-rich particles existent in the sediments and to transfer pore waters to the water 

column (Pato et al., 2008a). This erosion of contaminated sediments and consequent export does 

not, however, contribute to a major contamination problem for nearshore sites, since the semi-

enclosed structure of the Laranjo Bay prevents these Hg-associated particles from being 

transported outside the Bay (Lopes et al., 2001). In addition, the complex network of channels in 

the Ria de Aveiro lagoon captures contaminanted particules before coastal waters are reached; and 

nearby marine sediments have a low ability to incorporate Hg, reducing the impact on the coastal 

zone (Pato et al., 2008b).  

 



15 
 

Vegetated sediments are distinct from non-vegetated sediments in the Laranjo Bay: the vegetated 

sediment is more acidic, presents higher redox potential and higher organic matter content (Válega 

et al., 2008c), and is more contaminated with Hg than non-vegetated sediment (Válega et al., 

2008b). The latter is due to the ability of salt marsh plants to act as sediment traps, contributing to 

an elevated Hg content in the sediments, even after the reduction in contaminated effluents from 

the industrial complex (Válega et al., 2008c).

1.3 Endophytic bacteria  

The phytosphere 

The term phytosphere refers to the entirety of the tissues of a plant, and can be divided into 

different compartments (Figure 1.1) such as (i) aboveground (AG) tissues or phyllosphere 

(comprising stems, leaves, flowers); and (ii) belowground (BG) tissues or rhizosphere (root system). 

For both compartments, two divisions can be considered: the endosphere (inner tissues) and the 

episphere or ectosphere (outter tissues).  

 

Figure 1.1 Schematics of the phytosphere. 

 

All plants in natural settings have, at least in a phase of their life cycle, association with 

microorganisms (Partida-Martínez &amp;amp; Heil, 2011). Bacteria, archaea, fungi, algae and amoeba have 

been found in the different compartments of the phytosphere, revealing a microbial hotspot in this 

complex system (reviewed in Hardoim et al., 2015). Vandenkoornhuyse et al. (2015) discussed in 

detail the perspective of the plant as a holobiont, as a dynamic entity composed by the plant host 

and its microbiome, working together toward evolutionary fitness. The authors expose that the 

holobiont as a whole is the target of evolutionary processes, and that, consequently, the holobiont 

as a unit adapts to environmental settings. As a result of this adaption, plant-associated microbes 

are involved in functions such as improving the nutrition of the host and the resistance to biotic 

and abiotic stresses (Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015). Plant-associated bacteria are known to 

possess these functions, as they can participate in metal tolerance (Canário et al., 2007) and 

degradation of contaminants (Carvalho et al., 2010; Oliveira et al., 2014a; Oliveira et al., 2014b), 

among many other plant-beneficial role.

Endophytic bacteria 

Defining endophytic bacteria 

The definition of endophyte has changed throughout the years. In 1926, Perotti described 

endophyte as a particular stage in the life of a bacteria, as an advanced stage of infection, which is 

similar to mutualistic symbiosis (Perotti, 1926). Endophytes were then considered all those 

microorganisms that could be isolated from surface-sterilized plant organs (Henning &amp;amp; Villforth, 

1940). In 1992, Quispel introduced the concept of endophytic bacteria as those that colonize the 

inner tissues of the plant without damaging the host or eliciting strong defense responses. The 

latter definition of endophytic bacteria is currently widely used and is the definition that will be 

adopted throughout the present work. 

Bacterial endophytes may present different relationships with their plant hosts in the sense that 

there can be opportunistic or facultative endophytes. The former relates to endophytes that spend 

part of their life cycle as an epiphyte and occasionally migrate to inner tissues. The second refers to 

those that exhibit a more mutualistic life style with the plant host. An additional type of endophytic 

relationship is the ‘obligate’ endophyte, where there is a requirement of plant tissues to complete 

the microorganism’s life cycle. However, obligate endophytes have only been reported for fungi 

(Hardoim et al., 2015 and references therein). 

Regarding the function of the endophytic bacteria in the plant host, three groups can be considered: 

commensal, plant growth promoters or latent pathogens. The first group lives on the metabolites 

produced by the plant but have no apparent effect on the host. The second group causes a positive 

impact on the host by protecting against phytopathogens and exhibiting plant growth promoting 

(PGP) traits, as detailed below (Hardoim et al., 2015). Consequently, the microbiota of a plant can 

be seen as facilitators in the sense that the host-associated microbes provide additional genes that 

can be useful to adapt to environmental conditions (reviewed in Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015). 

Two types of endophytes may be considered according to their host-specificity. The first type 

comprises bacteria that bind to plant root surfaces in a non-specific manner and then migrate to 

inner tissues via wounds, cracks and lenticels in the root system. The second type comprises 

bacteria that specifically bind to certain plant species, e.g., rhizobia that bind to particular plant 

species to form nodules (Glick, 2015). Endophytes of the first type are, nevertheless, subjected to 

some degree of specificity due to the fact that different plant species produce different exudates 

that attract certain bacteria (Hardoim et al., 2015). 



18 
 

Colonization of inner tissues  

Bacteria can enroll in the endophytic lifestyle either through horizontal or vertical transmission.  

Horizontal transmission results from the entry of bacteria from the external environment into the 

plant, and this type of colonization most often occurs as bacteria enter the root system from the 

rhizosphere. The most common way of entry occurs via primary and lateral root hair cells, root 

cracks, wounds and hydrolysis of root cells. This hydrolysis process may be related to the production 

of enzymes with cellulolytic activity, however, colonization still occurs in the absence of cellulases 

(reviewed in Santoyo et al., 2016). Entry can also take place at the root tips through germinating 

radicles and openings that result from the natural growth process of the roots, or through lenticels 

(Hardoim et al., 2008; Santoyo et al., 2016). Colonization by specific groups of bacteria in the root 

system can result in the formation of root nodules, where nitrogen fixation can occur. Additional 

entry points also arise in AG tissues of plants, namely through stomata, lenticels and wounds caused 

by other organisms such as insects and fungi, hydathodes, flowers and fruits (reviewed in Hardoim 

et al., 2015; Santoyo et al., 2016). Bacterial taxa present in the ectosphere and in the endosphere 

may differ significantly, suggesting that the endosphere colonizers are equipped with a set of genes 

that allow for their establishment in the inner host tissues (reviewed in Reinhold-Hurek &amp;amp; Hurek, 

2011). 

Vertical transmission occurs when the endophytic bacteria present in the plant seed colonize the 

seedling and, further on, the adult plant (Santoyo et al., 2016).  

 

The colonization by soil bacteria into the root system is described as being related to the production 

of root exudates and rhizodeposits by the plant host (Hardoim et al., 2015). These exudates are the 

product of photosynthetic processes and comprise low (amino acids, sugars, organic acids, 

phenolics) and high molecular weight compounds (polysaccharides, proteins). The exudates 

produced are dependent on host species and growth stage, and environmental factors. Some root 

exudates can act as attractors to bacteria that can then migrate to the inner tissues of the root 

system (Glick, 2015). 

Once inside the inner tissues, endophytic bacteria reside in intercellular spaces (e.g., Gyaneshwar 

et al., 2001; reviewed in Hardoim et al., 2015). As a result of the alternative pathways of 

colonization for the different compartments of a plant, there are often divergences in the 

concentration of bacteria in BG tissues (usually more colonized) and AG tissues. This is often 



19 
 

observed in studies that regard endophytic bacteria where a distinction is made in these 

compartments (e.g., Wang et al., 2016). The divergences in communities observed for different 

plant tissues may also be due to tissue-specific chemical and/or physical properties (Hardoim et al., 

2015). It is widely accepted that the bacteria that colonize the inner root system are able to migrate 

to other tissues, namely to AG tissues, and that this dissemination occurs through the vascular 

system from the roots and shoots (Hardoim et al., 2015; Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015; Reinhold-

Hurek &amp;amp; Hurek, 2011 and references therein). These migration phenomena are representative of a 

microbial endosphere continuity (Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015 and references therein). 

 

Diversity of endophytic bacteria 

The bacterial taxonomic diversity and abundance present in the endosphere of a plant depends on 

many factors, including (i) plant-related factors such as the species, sampling tissue, health and 

growth stage, (ii) soil-related factors such as pH and moisture content, (iii) and abiotic factors such 

as temperature and altitude (Hardoim et al., 2008; Hardoim et al., 2015 and references therein). 

The most common approach to assess the diversity of the bacteria present in a sample relies on the 

sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. This ca. 1.5 kb gene is ubiquitous in bacteria, contains highly 

conserved regions and nine variable regions, where the sequence changes reflect a measure of time 

or evolution, allowing the gene sequence to act as a molecular clock. Although its effectiveness 

depends on the taxa at study, the properties of 16S rRNA gene make its sequencing and analysis 

the standard for bacteria identification usually up to the genus level (Janda &amp;amp; Abbott, 2007 and 

references therein).  

The diversity of the bacterial endophytome has been described as mostly pertaining to the phyla 

Proteobacteria (mainly to the classes Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria), 

Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria (Hardoim et al., 2015). The phyla Planctomycetes, 

Verrucomicrobia and Acidobacteria are described as being less abundant in the endosphere 

(Santoyo et al., 2016). Although only a small number of bacterial phyla are the most associated with 

the endophytic lifestyle, these four phyla contain many genera and species (Hardoim et al., 2015). 

In 2002, Lodewyckx et al. listed in review over eighty genera of endophytic isolates belonging to 

both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The list of bacterial genera that exhibit the endophytic 

lifestyle has been ever-growing as a result of advances in culture media, and also in new sequencing 

technologies that do not rely on culturability of the bacteria. Although the abovementioned four 



20 
 

phyla remain dominant across the endophytome of many plant species, the dominant families and 

lower-tier taxa are too host-specific or environment-specific to list. 

Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria from the endosphere of H. portulacoides have been assessed 

using a culture-dependent method. This community presented a dominance of Gram-negative 

bacteria, which included the genera Pseudomonas, Sphingobium, Acinetobacter and Ochrobactrum. 

The Gram-positive genera Microbacterium and Micrococcus were also dominant (Olivera et al., 

2014a). Another study on the culturable fraction of H. portulacoides-associated bacteria, namely 

from the rhizosphere, also used a hydrocarbon-enrichment step, and showed a dominance of 

Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes (Oliveira et al., 2014b). These assays where 

enrichment medium is used direct the focus of the study to a subset of the community, not 

assessing the whole diversity of the halophyte’s endophytome. 

 

Plant growth promoting traits 

Endophytic bacteria can present PGP abilities by direct and indirect mechanisms. Direct 

mechanisms include modulating phytohormone levels and enhancing nutrient uptake, while 

indirect mechanisms are related to competition with phytopathogens, thus decreasing the 

incidence and damages of diseases (Glick, 2015; Santoyo et al., 2016). Other mechanisms of 

inducing plant growth are known, such as the production of adenine ribosides, volatile compounds 

and polyamines, but are less studied (Hardoim et al., 2015 and references therein). The interactions 

between plant host and beneficial bacteria are highly dependent on (i) plant species or even 

cultivar, and plant growth stage, (ii) the species or even strain of the bacteria, (iii) biotic factors such 

as the presence of phytopathogens, (iv) and abiotic factors such as soil properties, presence of 

contaminants, and temperature (Glick, 2015).  

Nutrition enhancement methods involve nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and iron (Glick, 

2015; Satoyo et al., 2016). Nitrogen is required in molecules such as nucleic acids and proteins, and 

can be fixed as atmospheric nitrogen by diazotrophic bacteria but not directly by plants (Glick, 

2015). The association with diazotrophic bacteria is especially favorable for the plant host in 

nitrogen-poor environments (Hardoim et al., 2015). Phosphorus is required as a component of cell 

membranes and for the synthesis of nucleic acids. Most of the phosphorus in the soil is, however, 

not available for uptake by the plant. Some beneficial bacteria are able to secrete compounds that 

allow for the solubilization of phosphorous making it available for plant host uptake (Glick, 2015). 



21 
 

Iron is essential for living organisms as a cofactor of proteins involved in several cellular processes. 

The available iron in the soil is mostly present as insoluble ferric hydroxides which cannot be easily 

assimilated by either plant or bacterial cells. Consequently, iron sequestration mechanisms are 

necessary and occur in bacteria, fungi and some plants via the production and excretion of low 

molecular weight molecules called siderophores. These molecules are able to bind ferric iron, and 

this siderophore-iron complex can then be recognized by specific membrane receptors and enter 

the cell. Bacteria that produce siderophores are then able to supply iron for the nutritional needs 

of the plant, directly influencing the growth of the host (Glick, 2015).  

Direct PGP mechanisms include the production of phytohormones from different classes such as 

auxins, cytokinins and gibberellins, and participating in the decrease of the stress-related 

phytohormone ethylene (Glick, 2015; Satoyo et al., 2016). Auxins are known to influence plant 

processes such as root and shoot growth, tissue differentiation and cell division. Indol-3-acetic acid 

(IAA) is an auxin that has been found to be produced by ca. 85 % of rhizospheric bacteria (Glick, 

2015) and is thought to affect host growth by interfering with the plant defense system (Hardoim 

et al., 2015). Phytohormones belonging to the class cytokinins are known to promote plant cell 

division, seed germination, root elongation, differentiation of xylem and chloroplasts, fruit and 

flower development, nutritional signaling, leaf senescence and plant-pathogen interactions (Glick, 

2015). This class of phytohormone is commonly observed in endophytes (Hardoim et al., 2015). 

Gibberellins are known to increase stem growth, flowering, and leaf and fruit senescence (Glick, 

2015). The compound 1-amynocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) is the precursor for the 

production of the stress phytohormone ethylene. In the presence of biotic or abiotic stresses, plants 

can produce an excess of the hormone ethylene which inhibits plant growth. Beneficial bacteria 

that reduce ethylene levels in the plant do so by producing the enzyme ACC deaminase which 

cleaves the ACC molecule (reviewed in Santoyo et al., 2016; Glick, 2015; Hardoim et al., 2015).  

Indirect PGP mechanisms are mainly those that allow the endophytic bacteria to compete with 

phytopathogenic organisms. Beneficial bacteria that present these mechanisms limit the plant 

growth inhibition imposed by phytopathogens. The competition can be performed by means of 

enzymes that attack cell walls of phytopatogens, production of other antimicrobials, or competing 

for the same habitat and nutrients (Santoyo et al., 2016; Glick, 2015; Hardoim et al., 2015). One of 

the methods to compete for nutrition relies on siderophore production, since beneficial bacteria 

are sequestering iron from the environment, making it unavailable for phytopathogens (Glick, 2015; 

Hardoim et al., 2015). Bacteria can also be beneficial in the fight against phytopathogens by 



22 
 

producing cell wall degrading enzymes such as chitinases, proteases or lipases, which are able to 

lyse fungal cells (Glick, 2015). Endophytic bacteria can also lead to a higher tolerance to 

phytopathogens by inducing plant defense reactions in an initial phase of colonization. This trigger 

in plant immune response allows the host to engage against pathogens in a more efficient manner 

(Hardoim et al., 2015 and references therein). 

As a consequence of direct and indirect PGP mechanisms, the plant fitness in enhanced resulting in 

the perseverance of the plant host in the presence of biotic and abiotic stresses. The mechanisms 

employed by PGP endophytic bacteria can amount to several outcomes such as enhanced seed 

germination, increased growth of seedlings, roots and shoots, increased biomass, improved 

tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, production of secondary metabolites, and better plant 

nutrition (Glick, 2015). As an example of PGP endophytes in a closely related plant species, a study 

conducted on the halophyte Arthrocnemum macrostachyum (same family as H. portulacoides), 

showed that isolates from its endosphere exhibited PGP abilities. Eight isolates belonging to the 

family Bacillaceae exhibited PGP traits in vitro in the presence of salt, including enzymatic activities 

(pectinolytic, chitinolytic, cellulolytic, amylolytic and proteolytic), IAA production, phosphate 

solubilization and siderophore production. A consortium of promising isolates was tested for their 

PGP abilities in vivo, and was able to improve seed germination and enhance the salt tolerance of 

the plant host (Navarro-Torre et al., 2016). 

 

 

The endosphere is a relevant source of bacteria with extensive diversity. This diversity has been 

studied using different approaches, from classic microbiology by plating out macerated surface-

sterilized plant tissues, to molecular techniques. More recent advances in sequencing technologies 

have made available a plethora of molecular-based techniques: clone library construction, 

denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis profile analysis, 454-pyrosequencing, and most recently 

Illumina sequencing. In recent years, the most used approaches have been based on 16S rRNA gene 

sequencing from complex communities, however, whole genome metagenomics of the 

communities has been emerging recently (e.g., Akinsanya et al., 2015). Understanding the core 

diversity present in the endosphere of a plant allows for the development of plant-specific growth-

promoting agents, which can be of chief importance for downstream applications such as 

remediation or detoxification processes.

2.1 Scope 

The present work will explore the endophytic bacterial community of the salt marsh plant 

Halimione portulacoides. For this, three main aspects are considered for the scope of the document: 

 

I. The halophyte H. portulacoides presents phytoremediation capability, and its endosphere is an 

unexplored potential source of bacteria that promote plant growth and, subsequently, enhance 

phytoremediation processes. Endophytic bacteria will be obtained from sites with different degrees 

of metal(loid) contamination, using diverse culture media so as to obtain a representative 

collection. The isolates will then be subjected to several tests aiming at a deep characterization of 

the collection in regards to taxonomy, enzymatic activity and plant growth promotion (PGP) traits. 

Promising candidates for PGP will be further tested for their ability to promote growth in model 

plants. 

 

II. The endosphere is a relatively unexplored environment. As a consequence, there is a high 

likelihood that the endophytic bacteria collection will contain novel bacterial taxa, whose 

description will represent incremental advances in the field of microbiology. For this purpose, 

representatives of novel taxa will be described and added to databases respecting established 

regulations. 

 

III. The in-depth exploration of the endosphere by culture-independent methods has always faced 

the obstacle of host DNA contamination. As such, finding a way to overcome this problem is 

fundamental for this type of studies. In-depth analysis of the diversity in the endosphere will be 

assessed using PCR blockers that avoid host DNA contamination. 

 

This work, overall, has the potential to provide in-depth knowledge on bacterial diversity of 

endophytes, on bacterial strains that are adequate for promotion of halophyte growth in 

contaminated sites, and on novel bacterial species. 

  



30 
 

2.2 Main goal 

The main goal of the present work is to characterize endophytic bacterial communities associated 

with the salt marsh plant Halimione portulacoides. 

 

2.3 Specific goals 

In order to accomplish the proposed main goal, five specific goals were established: 

I. Establish a collection of endophytic bacteria from H. portulacoides sampled from sites with high, 

intermediate and no metal(loid) contamination.  

II. Understand the structure, diversity and properties of the collection of endophytic bacteria.  

III. Identify potential candidates for in vivo PGP and perform tests on model plants.  

IV. Identify and describe novel taxa within the endophytic bacteria collection.  

V. Gain a deeper insight into the structure and diversity of the endophytic bacteria associated with 

H. portulacoides by combining information from culture-based and culture-independent 

approaches. 

 

2.4 Hypotheses 

The following are hypotheses to be tested throughout the work: 

I. The endosphere of the halophyte H. portulacoides is a hotspot for bacterial diversity. 

II. The presence of metal(loid)s influences the structure and diversity of the endophytic bacteria of 

H. portulacoides.  

III. The endophytic bacterial community of the halophyte includes bacteria that have potential for 

promoting plant growth. 

IV. The endophytic bacterial community of the halophyte includes a plethora of novel bacteria taxa.

Abstract 

Halimione portulacoides is abundant in salt marshes, accumulates mercury (Hg), and was proposed 

as useful for phytoremediation and pollution biomonitoring. Endophytic bacteria promote plant 

growth and provide compounds with industrial applications. Nevertheless, information about 

endophytic bacteria from H. portulacoides is scarce. Endophytic isolates (n = 665) were obtained 

from aboveground and belowground plant tissues, from two Hg-contaminated sites (sites E and B) 

and a non-contaminated site (site C), in the estuary Ria de Aveiro. Representative isolates (n = 467) 

were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and subjected to functional assays. Isolates affiliated 

with Proteobacteria (64 %), Actinobacteria (23 %), Firmicutes (10 %), and Bacteroidetes (3 %). 

Altererythrobacter (7.4 %), Marinilactibacillus (6.4 %), Microbacterium (10.2 %), Salinicola (8.8 %), 

and Vibrio (7.8 %) were the most abundant genera. Notably, Salinicola (n = 58) were only isolated 

from site C; Hoeflea (17), Labrenzia (22), and Microbacterium (67) only from belowground tissues. 

This is the first report of Marinilactibacillus in the endosphere. Principal coordinate analysis showed 

that community composition changes with the contamination gradient and tissue. Our results 

suggest that the endosphere of H. portulacoides represents a diverse bacterial hotspot including 

putative novel species. Many isolates, particularly those affiliated to Altererythrobacter, 

Marinilactibacillus, Microbacterium, and Vibrio, tested positive for enzymatic activities and plant 

growth promoters, exposing H. portulacoides as a source of bacteria and compounds with 

biotechnological applications.

Background 

Salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems in terms of primary production and are a 

habitat to several species with commercial value (Alongi, 1998). The vegetation in this type of 

ecosystem is usually subjected to harsh environmental conditions including periodic tidal flooding, 

high salinity levels, and contaminants such as metals from urban and industrial effluents. As a 

consequence, the typical salt marsh vegetation presents low species diversity and high 

specialization (Woerner and Hackney, 1997).  

Ria de Aveiro, a costal lagoon on the northwest of Portugal, is one of the most mercury-

contaminated coastal systems in Portugal. For over four decades (1950–1994), industrial effluents 

containing mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), and other contaminants were discharged 

into natural water streams of this lagoon which led to contamination of water and sediments of 

adjacent marshes (Costa and Jesus-Rydin, 2001). Although discharges have substantially decreased 

over the last two decades, sediments in the Laranjo Bay salt marshes are still considerably 

contaminated, namely with Hg. This highly toxic nonessential metal is a hazardous contaminant 

with potential to be released to the water column and assimilated by the biota (Pereira et al., 2009).  

The perennial halophyte Halimione portulacoides (L.) Aellen is one of the most productive and 

abundant species in European salt marshes (Bouchard et al., 1998), including those along the Ria 

de Aveiro lagoon. This Hg-tolerant halophyte allocates this toxic metal preferably to belowground 

tissues and was proposed as a bioindicator and biomonitor for Hg pollution (Válega et al., 2008a). 

Additionally, this halophyte has been proposed for phytoremediation of Hg (Anjum et al., 2011), 

tributyltin (Carvalho et al., 2010), and petroleum hydrocarbons (Couto et al., 2011). 

Endophytic bacteria colonize internal plant tissues without causing symptoms of disease 

(Lodewyckx et al., 2002). These bacteria are highly diverse taxonomically, ubiquitous from 

herbaceous plants to trees, and contribute to plant health and productivity (Berg et al., 2014). 

Endophytes present a great potential for applications in agricultural, medical, biotechnological, and 

industrial fields. Industrially important enzymes such as amylases, cellulases, lipases, pectinases, 

proteases, and xylanases, among others, have previously been found in endophytic bacteria (e.g., 

Lodewyckx et al., 2002). 

Plant-associated bacteria, including endophytic bacteria, are known to be very relevant for plant 

growth promotion (PGP; Hardoim et al. 2008), including in cases of biotic or abiotic stresses, such 

as contaminated soils (reviewed in Rajkumar et al., 2012). This PGP action may be conducted 



36 
 

through direct or indirect mechanisms. Direct PGP mechanisms include enhancement of plant 

nutrient acquisition, by aiding in nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilization; plant growth by 

production of the auxin indol-3-acetic acid (IAA); and lowering of ethylene-related plant stress by 

producing the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase. Indirect PGP is 

achieved by preventing phytopathogen prejudicial effects on plant development by producing 

metabolites involved in antimicrobial activities and iron chelation (reviewed in Bulgarelli et al., 

2013). It is also known that plant-associated bacteria are able to aid in phytoremediation processes 

by phytoextraction (reviewed in Sessitsch et al., 2013). In fact, Oliveira et al. (2014a) have shown 

that endophytic bacteria isolated from H. portulacoides have potential to be used in detoxification 

of petroleum hydrocarbons. 

Notwithstanding the acknowledged importance of endophytic bacteria, comprehensive studies 

regarding the basal culturable communities of these bacteria in the specific environment of salt 

marshes are scarce, as studies are usually directed toward studying contaminant-degrading 

bacteria. Halimione portulacoides is a highly relevant and ecologically important halophyte in salt 

marshes; however, the structure of endophytic bacterial communities of this plant has not yet been 

fully explored, only its fraction that is able to degrade hydrocarbons (Oliveira et al., 2014a).  

This study aimed to characterize the culturable endophytic bacterial communities of this halophyte 

from a highly contaminated site, an intermediately contaminated site, and a non-contaminated site 

in Ria de Aveiro, regarding their phylogenetic diversity and traits associated with direct and indirect 

PGP effects.

Methods 

Study Area and Sampling 

The study was conducted in the estuary Ria de Aveiro, in Aveiro, Portugal. A confined area in this 

lagoon was subjected to Hg-rich industrial discharges for four decades (1950s–1990s, Pereira et al., 

1998). Three locations in the salt marsh of Ria de Aveiro were assessed: one highly contaminated 

by industrial activity (site B, 450 m downstream from the contamination source in the estuary, 40° 

43? 47.46? N, 8° 36? 45.40? W), one with intermediate levels of contamination (site E, 2500 m 

downstream from the contamination source, 40° 43? 15.90? N, 8° 38? 15.76? W) (Válega et al., 

2008b), and a non-contaminated location (site C, 40° 38? 05.36? N, 8° 39? 38.87? W; 11.3 km from 

the contamination source). Healthy specimens of the halophyte H. portulacoides were sampled in 

monospecific stands, at least in triplicate in each site. Adjacent sediment was sampled in triplicate 

with a 3 cm in diameter and 13 cm depth corer. Sampling was performed during low tide in 

November 2012 (average temperature 16 °C). Samples were transported to the laboratory under 

refrigerated conditions and promptly processed. 

 

Metal(loid) quantification 

Composite samples of aboveground (AG) tissues (leaves, stems, and flowers; 1 g fresh weight), 

belowground (BG) tissues (roots; 1 g FW), and sediment (2 g FW) from each site were used for 

metal(loid) quantification, in triplicate. Chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), As (as total 

arsenic), and mercury (Hg) were quantified. Samples were subjected to acid digestion with 

concentrated nitric acid overnight at 115 °C (Figueira and Freitas, 2013) and analyzed by inductively 

coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) according to the International Standard ISO 17294 by 

a certified laboratory at the University of Aveiro. 

One-way ANOVA (function aov) combined with post hoc Tukey’s honest significant differences 

method (function TukeyHSD) were used to assess differences in metal(loid) concentrations in 

sediment and plant tissue samples on all sites. Welch two-sample t test (function t.test) was used 

to estimate differences in metal(loid) concentrations (i) among plant tissues, for each isolation site 

and (ii) between sediment and plant samples, for each isolation site. These analyses were 

performed using the stats package in the free software R (R Core Team, 2014) with 

abovementioned functions aov, TukeyHSD, and t.test, considering a 95 % confidence interval. 



38 
 

Isolation of endophytic bacteria, growth media, and conditions 

Eleven plants were processed at the laboratory: five from site C, three from site B, and three from 

site E. First, all plants were thoroughly washed with tap water. For each plant, 5 g (FW) of AG tissues 

and 2 g (FW) of BG tissues were used for endophytic bacteria isolation. Surface sterilization was 

optimized and performed as follows: samples were sequentially immersed in 50 mL of phosphate-

buffered saline (PBS; 10 min), 96 % ethanol (1 min), 5 % NaOCl (30 min), 96 % ethanol (1 min), and 

rinsing in distilled sterile water three times. Surface sterilization was confirmed by inoculating water 

from the last wash in Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA, Merck, Germany), Marine Agar (MA, Difco Laboratories, 

France), and R2A (Merck, Germany) culture media. The plates were examined for bacterial growth 

after incubation at 28 °C for 72 h. Tissues were then ground with a pestle in a mortar containing 10 

mL of PBS. Serial dilutions were prepared in PBS and spread, in duplicate, on TSA, MA, and R2A 

media. The plates were incubated up to 72 h at 28 °C and were observed every 24 h for colony-

forming unit (CFU) count. Morphologically distinct endophytic bacterial colonies were selected and 

purified by streaking, resulting in a collection of 665 endophytic bacterial isolates, and stored at ?80 

°C in 20 % glycerol. Function aov combined with TukeyHSD was used to assess differences in average 

CFU per gram of tissue (fresh weight) in different isolation sites and culture media, and t.test was 

used to assess tissue-based differences. 

 

DNA extraction, PCR-based fingerprinting, and selection of representative isolates 

DNA from all 665 isolates was extracted using the Genomic DNA Purification kit #0513 (Thermo 

Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. BOX-PCR with BOXA1 primer (5?-

CTACGGCAAGGCGACGCTGAC-3?; Versalovic et al., 1994) was used for molecular typing of all 

isolates. PCR reactions were performed in a volume of 25 ?L, using 5× Green GoTaq buffer, GoTaq 

DNA polymerase (5U ?L?1), MgCl2 (25 mM), and a dNTP mixture (2 mM) (Promega, USA). Conditions 

for amplification were as follows: one cycle at 95 °C (7 min), 30 cycles at 94 °C (1 min), 53 °C (1 min), 

65 °C (8 min), and a final cycle at 65 °C (16 min). One hundred thirty-three isolates did not yield a 

clear profile with this methodology and were typed using ERIC-PCR with ERIC1R (5?-

ATGTAAGCTCCTGGGGATTCAC-3?; Versalovic et al., 1991) and ERIC2 (5?-

AAGTAAGTGACTGGGGTGAGCG-3?; Versalovic et al., 1991) primers. Conditions for PCR 

amplification were the same as for BOX-PCR, except the annealing temperature, which was 52 °C.

Analysis of the genetic fingerprinting patterns was performed with GelCompar II software (Applied 

Maths, Belgium). The Pearson correlation coefficient was applied, and cluster analysis was 

performed using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) algorithm. The 

resulting dendrograms were analyzed in order to obtain groups of isolates with at least 85 % 

similarity. This cutoff was determined so that patterns that were known to be equal (molecular-

weight size markers) would be considered to be in the same group. Representative isolates of each 

group were randomly selected. A total of 467 representative isolates were obtained: 419 from 

molecular typing and 48 isolates that did not yield clear profiles by either BOX- or ERIC-PCR. 

 

16S rRNA gene amplification, phylogenetic affiliation, and multivariate analyses 

Four hundred sixty-seven representative isolates were subjected to PCR amplification of 16S rRNA 

gene using the universal primers 27f (5?-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3?; Lane, 1991) and 1492r (5?-

GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3?; Lane, 1991) and the NZYTaq 2× Green Master Mix (NZYTech, Portugal) 

in 25-?L reactions: one cycle at 94 °C (5 min), 30 cycles at 94 °C (1 min), 55 °C (1 min), 72 °C (1.5 

min), and a final cycle at 72 °C (10 min). Five isolates did not yield quality sequences after several 

attempts and were excluded from the analysis. The remaining 462 amplification products were 

purified with the DNA Clean &amp;amp; Concentrator ™-5 (Zymoresearch, USA) according to manufacturer’s 

instructions. Amplicons were partially sequenced with primer 27f using GATC Biotech services 

(Germany) according to company specifications. The partial 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained in 

this study were submitted to GenBank and are available under the accession numbers KT324749 to 

KT325209. Quality sequences with an overall average of 893 bp were examined and edited with 

FinchTV V1.4.0 software (Geospiza, USA). The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST; Altschul et 

al., 1997) and the EzTaxon server (Kim et al., 2012) were used to obtain taxonomic classification up 

to the genus level. Information from the representative isolates was used to associate taxonomic 

affiliation to the respective 658 isolates from the collection. Sequences were then subjected to the 

Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) pyrosequencing pipeline (Cole et al., 2014), where they were 

aligned and clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) considering a distance limit of 0.03 

(97 % similarity). Consequently, an OTU table was built with abundances for 21 samples: five for 

CAG—community from AG tissues from site C; five for CBG—BG tissues from site C; two for EAG—

AG tissues from site E; three for EBG—BG tissues from site E; three for BAG—AG tissues from site 

B; and three for BBG—BG tissues from site B. Three AG samples were collected from site E; 



40 
 

however, only two yielded culturable bacteria. As such, only those were considered for subsequent 

analyses. 

Using R version 3.1.1 (R Core Team, 2014), several analyses were performed to characterize the 

bacterial communities regarding their OTU abundance. Diversity indices Shannon’s H? diversity and 

Pielou’s evenness were assessed with functions diversity and with diversity/log(specnumber), 

respectively, from the vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2015). The multipatt function from package 

indicspecies (De Caceres and Legendre, 2009) was used to find indicator species (here, OTUs) in 

samples from different sites, tissues and communities, using a 10 % significance level for selecting 

indicators. The species-site group association parameter “IndVal.g” was used, since it corrects for 

unequal group sizes.  

The variation in OTU composition among the samples was analyzed by assessing differences in a 

dissimilarity matrix, built with Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure (function vegdist from package 

vegan in R) after transforming the OTU abundance table with square root (function sqrt in R). 

PERMANOVA was used to analyze variances in the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix using the adonis 

function (from package vegan in R) on the interaction between isolation site and tissue, and to both 

variables independently. For this analysis, the number of permutations was 999 in all tests.  

Information in the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix was then graphically assessed with a principal 

coordinate analysis (PCoA) using cmdscale function (from package vegan in R) to create the PCoA 

ordination. The significance of the observed patterns in the PCoA was analyzed by assessing 

differences in sample scores across PCoA axis 1 (PCoA1) and PCoA axis 2 (PCoA2). The normality 

test shapiro.test (stats package in R) revealed non-normality in PCoA1 (Shapiro-Wilk: W=0.8848, p-

value &amp;lt;0.05) and normality in PCoA2 (Shapiro-Wilk: W = 9352, p-value &gt; 0.1). As a consequence, 

patterns in PCoA1 were assessed with Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (kruskal.test from stats package 

in R) combined with posthoc.kruskal.nemenyi.test (from PMCMR package in R; Pohlert 2005) for 

samples from different sites and communities, and with Wilcoxon rank sum test (wilcox.test from 

stats package in R) for samples from different tissues. PCoA2 patterns were analyzed with aov for 

samples from different sites and communities, and with t.test for samples from different tissues.

Screening of endophytic bacteria for enzymatic activity  

The 467 representative isolates were individually screened, in triplicate, for different enzymatic 

activities: amylolytic, cellulolytic, lipolytic, pectinolytic (at pH 5.0 and 7.0), proteolytic, and 

xylanolytic. The ability of the isolates to degrade a substrate was evaluated using 0.2 % starch, 0.5 

% carboxymethyl cellulose, 1 % Tween 20, 0.5 % pectin, 1 % skim milk, or 0.5 % xylan, respectively, 

on TSA or MA culture medium. The basal culture medium (TSA or MA) was selected for each isolate, 

according to where best bacterial growth was obtained. Tween 20 and skim milk solutions were 

sterilized separately and only added to the culture media after cooling down. The agar medium 

plates were inoculated with 5 ?L of a bacterial suspension with optical density (OD) at 600 nm=0.8 

U and incubated at 30 °C until sufficient growth was obtained, or up to 120 h. The enzymatic 

activities were assessed according to the presence (positive result) or absence (negative result) of 

a halo surrounding the bacterial growth. Amylolytic activity was detected when a clear halo was 

observed upon addition of Lugol solution to the agar plate. Cellulolytic and xylanolytic activities 

were detected when a clear halo was observed upon incubation with a 1 % Congo red solution (with 

10 % ethanol) and subsequent wash with 1 M NaCl. Lipolytic activity was observed by the formation 

of a white precipitate around the bacterial growth. Pectinolytic activity was detected by formation 

of a clear halo after addition of 1 % hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solution. 

Proteolytic activity was revealed by visualization of a clear halo against an opaque background. The 

results were interpreted according to the visibility of the halo obtained: negative, no halo observed; 

positive, faint to intense halo observed. 

 

Screening of endophytic bacteria for plant growth promotion traits 

Representative isolates were individually screened for different PGP traits: ACC deaminase activity, 

IAA production, phosphate solubilization, and siderophore production. Isolates were incubated in 

adequate growth media at 30 °C until sufficient growth was obtained. Unless otherwise stated, 

strains for negative and positive controls were studied in Pereira et al. (2013).  

To determine ACC deaminase activity, isolates were grown in DF salt minimal medium (Dworkin 

and Foster, 1958) or variations of this medium. Basal DF was prepared as follows (per liter): 4 g 

KH2PO4, 6 g Na2HPO4, 0.2 g MgSO4·7H2O, 2 g glucose, 1 mg FeSO4·7H2O, 10 ?g H3BO3, 10 ?g MnSO4, 

70 ?g ZnSO4, 50 ?g CuSO4, 10 ?g MoO3, 12 g agar, pH 7.2. This medium was either supplemented 

with 3 mM ACC (DF + ACC; ACC was sterilized by filtration and added to cooled down medium) or 2 



42 
 

g L?1 (NH4)2SO4 (DF + ammonium sulfate) or no nitrogen source (DF). The ability to use ACC as a sole 

nitrogen source is a consequence of the activity of the enzyme ACC deaminase (Penrose and Glick, 

2003). Pseudomonas putida EAPC8 and Arthrobacter rombi EC32A were used as positive controls 

for ACC deaminase activity. 

To test for IAA production, the method of Gordon and Weber (1951) was used: for each isolate, 500 

?L of supernatant obtained from cultures grown in MB or TSB + L?tryptophan (1 %) was mixed with 

1 mL of Salper solution. After incubating in the dark for 30 min, OD was read at 535 nm. Using a 

calibration curve of pure IAA as a standard, IAA concentrations (?g mL?1) were obtained for each 

isolate. Pseudomonas putida EAPC8 and Pseudomonas fluorescens S3X were used as positive 

controls for IAA production. 

The ability of isolates to solubilize phosphate was screened on National Botanical Research 

Institute’s Phosphate (NBRIP) solid growth medium (Nautiyal, 1999). After inoculation and 

appropriate incubation, phosphate solubilization was observed as a clear halo surrounding the 

bacterial growth. Pseudomonas reactans EDP28, P. putida EAPC8, A. rombi EC32A, and P. 

fluorescens S3X were used as negative controls for phosphate solubilization, and Arthrobacter 

nicotinovorans EAPAA and Rhodococcus sp. EC35 were used as positive controls.  

In order to test for siderophore production, all glass materials used were deferrated by treating 

with 6 % nitric acid and extensively washing with sterile double distilled water. Culture media 

deferration was conducted on TSA and MA medium as described by Cox (1994). After inoculation 

and incubation on either medium, the plates with bacterial growth were overlaid with CAS (O?CAS; 

Pérez?Miranda et al., 2007) and incubated with this overlay for 2 h. Siderophore production was 

detected as a change of color of the overlay from blue to orange or purple. This assay was only 

performed with TSA medium, since the O?CAS reacted with MA medium preventing a clear reading 

of the result. Pseudomonas reactans EDP28, P. putida EAPC8, A. rombi EC32A, P. fluorescens S3X, 

A. nicotinovorans EAPAA, and Rhodococcus sp. EC35 were used as positive controls for siderophore 

production. 

The representative isolates were also assessed for their nitrogen fixing abilities by PCR?screening 

for the presence of nifH gene: the primers IGK3 and DVV (Ando et al., 2005), described as the best 

pair of primers to use in nifH amplification (Gaby and Buckley, 2012) were used with the NZYTaq 2× 

Green Master Mix (NZYTech, Portugal) in 25 ?L reactions. Conditions for PCR amplification were as 

follows: initial denaturing at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 45 s, 

annealing at 56 °C for 30 s, and extending at 72 °C for 1 min. A final extension was performed at 72 



43 
 

°C for 10 min. Rahnella aquatilis M72troncoD (HQ538817; Proença et al., 2010) was used as a 

positive control, and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was used as a negative control (Gaby and Buckley, 

2012). The resulting PCR products were observed in a 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis.

Results 

Metal(loid) quantification of sediments and plant tissue 

Five metals (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Hg) and the metalloid As were quantified from samples collected at 

sites C, E, and B, in sediment samples from monospecific stands of H. portulacoides, in AG and BG 

tissues. The results are presented in Table 3.1. For some replicates of Hg concentration 

determination in sites C and E, the obtained values were below detection limits (&amp;lt;2 ?g L?1). In these 

cases, half of the lowest detectable concentration was used in statistical analyses.

Sediment samples collected from sites E and B presented concentrations at least 3?fold higher than 

samples from site C for all metal(loid)s tested (p?value &amp;lt;0.05). For As and Hg, a contamination 

gradient could be observed, where site B (closest to the effluent discharge) had the most 

contaminated sediment samples and site E presented intermediate contamination (p?value &amp;lt;0.05). 

Remarkably, sediment Hg concentration was, on average, 31 (site E) to 135 (site B) times higher 

than in samples from site C. All sediment samples were more contaminated than plant tissue 

samples, in all sites, for all tested metal(loid)s (p?value &amp;lt;0.05), except Hg in site C, where the 

differences in the metal concentration did not present statistical significance. 



45 
 

Considering metal(loid) contents in each site separately, we observed that in site B, metal(loid)s 

concentration in AG tissues were significantly lower than that in BG tissues. The same was observed 

for Ni in site E (p?value &amp;lt;0.05). Remarkably, Hg contamination of BG tissues in site B was 33?fold 

higher than in site C.  

Considering metal(loid) contents in each type of tissue separately, we saw that BG tissues were 

significantly more contaminated with Cr, Ni, and Hg in site B than in site C. In the specific cases of 

As in AG tissues and Hg in both tissues, a significant gradient was observed: C &amp;lt;E &amp;lt;B (p?value &amp;lt;

0.05). 

 

Phylogenetic diversity of endophytic bacteria, community structure, and multivariate analyses 

Endophytic bacteria from sites C, E, and B were isolated from surface sterilized AG and BG tissues 

from eleven plants, in TSA, MA, and R2A culture media. Extensive results for CFU g?1 (FW) for all 

sampled plants are stated in Supplementary Table S3.1. AG tissues from site C presented 

significantly more CFU g?1 than BG tissues (p?value &amp;lt;0.05). The opposite was observed in sites E (p?

value &amp;lt;0.05) and B (only for TSA culture medium; p?value &amp;lt;0.05).  

The selection of morphologically distinct colonies from all culture media, plant tissues, and sampling 

sites resulted in a collection of 665 endophytic isolates. Molecular typing of the collection yielded 

467 representative isolates (150 from CAG community, 74 from CBG, 18 from EAG, 94 from EBG, 

33 from BAG, and 97 from BBG), for which partial sequences of 16S rRNA gene were obtained. Five 

isolates did not yield quality sequences after several attempts and were excluded from the analysis, 

resulting in 462 amplification products. Taxonomic classification yielded matches with similarity 

ranging from 92.79 to 100 % similarity. Twenty?nine of 462 isolates (6.3 %) exhibited an identity 

percentage lower than 97 with the closest match, suggesting the potential for novel species in the 

collection. Taxonomic information was then affiliated to the respective 658 isolates. 

 

The 658 isolates were distributed amongst class?level identification and grouped according to 

isolation site and tissue in Figure 3.1. The phylum Proteobacteria (mainly classes 

Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria) clearly dominated the collection of endophytic 

bacteria (64.29 % of 658 isolates; Figure 3.1 and Supplementary Table S3.2), followed by 

Actinobacteria (22.8%) and Firmicutes (10.33%). The phylum Bacteroidetes was also present, but 



46 
 

less represented (2.58 %). Figure 3.1 also shows that Alphaproteobacteria are highly represented 

in all six communities, and that Gammaproteobacteria, although present in all communities, are 

most abundant in site C. Isolates from classes Bacilli and Actinobacteria are present in all 

communities, except Actinobacteria in the community with the lower number of isolates (EAG, 22 

isolates). 

The most common families of bacteria in the collection were Vibrionaceae (51 of 658 isolates, 7.75 

%) Microbacteriaceae (85/658 isolates, 12.92 %), Erythrobacteraceae (87/658 isolates, 13.22 %), 

and Halomonadaceae (98/658 isolates, 14.89 %). The complete distribution of the 658 isolates 

across 79 genera in all six communities is presented in Supplementary Table S3.2. Overall, the most 

abundant genera were Altererythrobacter, Marinilactibacillus, Microbacterium, Salinicola, and 

Vibrio, with 49, 42, 67, 58, and 51 isolates, respectively. Altererythrobacter was the only genus 

present in all six communities. Isolates belonging to the genera Altererythrobacter, Bacillus, 

Citromicrobium, Demequina, Labrenzia, Marinilactibacillus, Martelella, Microbacterium, 

Micrococcus, Pseudomonas, Sphingorabdus, Stakelama, Vibrio, and Zunongwangia were present in 

all sites. Isolates belonging to 29 of the 79 genera were present in both BG and AG tissues. 

Notably, all 58 isolates (8.8 % of the collection) associated with the genus Salinicola were exclusively 

isolated from site C. Hoeflea, Labrenzia, and Microbacterium were exclusive and considerably 

dominant in BG tissues, with 17 (2.6 % of the collection), 22 (3.3 %), and 67 (10.2 %) isolates, 

respectively. 

 

An OTU table was built with abundances across all samples, using the RDP pyrosequencing pipeline. 

The OTUs were defined considering a distance limit of 0.03 (97 % similarity) and their distribution 

across communities is stated in Table 3.2. Analysis of indicator OTUs showed that the OTUs, here 

annotated with the corresponding genera, that contributed most for the characterization of each 

sampling site were as follows: OTU_005 (Salinicola spp., 58 isolates, p?value &amp;lt;0.05) for site C, and 

OTU_077 (Bacillus spp., 11 isolates, p?value &amp;lt;0.05) and OTU_028 (Rhizobium spp., 6 isolates, p?

value &amp;lt;0.05) for site B. This analysis also showed that indicator OTUs for the isolation tissue were 

as follows: OTU_104 (Zunongwangia spp., 5 isolates, p?value &amp;lt;0.05) for AG tissues, and OTU_033 

(Labrenzia spp., 22 isolates, p?value &amp;lt;0.05) and OTU_219 (Microbacterium spp., 44 isolates, p?value 

&amp;lt;0.05) for BG tissues.

tissues. AG, aboveground; BG, belowground; a?, b? and g?Proteobacteria refers to Alphaproteobacteria, 

Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, respectively. 

 

A Bray?Curtis dissimilarity matrix was computed on a square root?transformed OTU table which 

allowed comparison of bacterial communities of all samples. The resulting matrix was tested for 

significant differences with PERMANOVA (adonis function in R). The interaction between isolation 

site and tissue was significant (adonis: F2,15= 1.38, R2 = 0.12, p?value &amp;lt;0.05), as was the test for each 

independent variable: isolation site (adonis: F2,18 = 1.65, R2 = 0.14, p?value &amp;lt;0.01) and tissue (adonis: 

F1,19 = 2.08, R2 = 0.09, p?value &amp;lt;0.01). However, only 23 % of the variation in the bacterial 

composition was explained by both variables and 12 % by their interaction. 

A PCoA plot was generated based on the Bray?Curtis dissimilarity matrix to compare all bacterial 

communities (Figure 3.2). The PCoA plot shows a clear gradient across axis PCoA1 which coincides 

with the presence of contamination, as samples with most contamination (BG tissues from sites B 

and E, see Table 3.1) are grouped in the left side of the plot. Analysis of sample scores across PCoA1 

revealed that there are significant differences in OTU composition in isolation sites (Kruskal?Wallis 

chi?squared = 7.66, df = 2, p?value &amp;lt;0.05) and in isolation tissues (Wilcoxon rank sum test: W= 93, 

p?value &amp;lt;0.01). This was not observed in PCoA2 for either isolation sites (ANOVA: F2,18= 2.53, p?

value &gt; 0.1) nor tissues (t test: t =?1.8, df=14.97, p?value &gt; 0.05).

Enzymatic activity and plant growth promotion traits in endophytic bacteria 

Assays for enzymatic activities and PGP traits were successful for 89–100 % of the representative 

isolates. Test success for siderophore production was 85.2 %; the remaining isolates (n = 69) were 

not able to grow in TSA medium, only MA, where a reaction occurred with the CAS?overlay and 

interfered with the interpretation of the result. Screening results are stated in Table 3.3 and the 

extensive list of results for all isolates is in Supplementary Table S3.3.  

Only 5.6 to 22.1 % of isolates tested positive for pectinolytic activity. A great percentage of isolates 

tested positive for all other enzymatic assays (up to 73.2 %), especially IAA production and ACC 

deaminase activity (98.9 and 51.2 %, respectively). IAA production was detected in 464 isolates, 

with concentrations ranging from 0.48 to 206 ?g mL?1. Seventeen IAA producers presented high 

levels of IAA concentration, over 100 ?g mL?1, 15 of which belonged to Proteobacteria phylum (5 

Pseudomonas sp.).

Isolates belonging to six genera (one Chromohalobacter, one Halomonas, one Marinomonas, one

lipolytic, pectinolytic (at pH 7), proteolytic, and xylanolytic activities. From the 97 isolates that 

tested positive for nifH amplification, 74 belonged to the Proteobacteria phylum, including 19 Vibrio 

sp. isolates. The most noteworthy genera were Altererythrobacter (from the 31 isolates of this 

genus, 29 were lipolytic and 24 xylanolytic, 22 presented both of these activities), 

Marinilactibacillus (24 cellulolytic, 18 proteolytic and 39 xylanolytic isolates, out of 41 isolates from 

this genus), Microbacterium (32 amylolytic, 30 cellulolytic and 29 xylanolytic isolates, from 39 

Microbacterium sp. isolates), and Vibrio (14 isolates producing every enzyme tested, from a total 

of 33 Vibrio sp. isolates). Isolates associated to five genera (one Altererythrobacter, one Ensifer, one 

Oceanibulbus, one Stakelama, and two Vibrio) displayed positive results for all tested PGP traits 

assays (Supplementary Table S3.3). 

 

The community?based and class?level distribution of representative isolates that tested positive for 

the assayed enzymatic activities and PGP traits are represented in Figure 3.3 and Supplementary 

Figure S3.1, respectively. The class?level distribution of isolates that tested positive in all assayed 

enzymatic activities and PGPs was a reflection of the class?level and community?based distribution 

of all isolates of our collection (Figure 3.1 and Table 3.2, respectively), i.e., the classes with higher 

representability in the endophytic collection were also those that presented more isolates that 

tested positive for the assayed enzymes and traits. This suggests that the probability of the 

presence of traits in a given class depends on the number of isolates in that class, instead of 

depending on the site or tissue of isolation.

Discussion 

The main aim of this study was to elucidate the structure, diversity, and function of culturable 

endophytic bacterial communities from the salt marsh plant H. portulacoides. To our knowledge, 

this is the first study regarding the isolation, identification, and functional characterization of 

endophytic bacteria in healthy specimens of the halophyte H. portulacoides. Bacteria were isolated 

from AG and BG tissues from the halophyte, collected from two sites contaminated with industrial 

effluents and one non-contaminated control site. Several authors have verified that a gradient of 

contamination exists, from Laranjo Bay to nearshore, especially regarding sediment Hg 

contamination (reviewed in Pereira et al., 2009). In the present study, sediment samples presented 

higher metal(loid) contents in sites closest to the industrial effluent discharges (sites B and E). In 

fact, for As and Hg, a significant concentration gradient could be observed, where content in B &gt; E 

&gt; C. These metal(loid)s were among the known main contaminants in the industrial effluents in 

Laranjo Bay, as is stated in the report by Costa and Jesus-Rydin (2001).  

Several studies have found that H. portulacoides mainly accumulates metals in the BG tissues and 

that BG to AG translocation is very low (e.g., Válega et al., 2008a; Válega et al., 2008b; Anjum et al., 

2011). The same pattern was observed in BG and AG tissues in this study, for all tested metals in 

site B (up to 6 times more metal content than in AG tissues) and for Ni in site E (average of 4.5 times 

more Ni in BG than in AG tissues). This allocation pattern was described by Lozano-Rodriguez et al. 

(1997) as a strategy for protecting the more sensitive AG tissues from the effects of metal-induced 

stress.  

We analyzed a much higher number of isolates than what is usually observed in studies focusing 

endophytic bacteria. This could be attributed to the fact that we used three culture media with 

different nutritional compositions and that the plate incubation period for the isolation of the 

endophytic bacteria was long (72 h). Sample sizes were considerably smaller for EAG and BAG 

communities and, as a consequence of this unbalance dataset, analyzing indicator OTUs may raise 

concerns. However, when using the parameter “IndVal.g” in the indicspecies package in R, there is 

a correction for unequal group sizes in the calculations for indicator species (OTUs in our case). The 

quantity “A,” used in calculating the IndVal, is obtained by using the mean abundance of the species 

in the target site group divided by the sum of the mean abundance values over all groups. In using 

the sum of the mean abundance values over all groups, instead of using real abundances from all 

groups, the unequal sizes of the site groups are controlled for (De Caceres and Legendre, 2009). 

Regarding the statistical analysis performed based on a dissimilarity measure (Bray-Curtis), we 



53 
 

minimized the most relevant intrinsic bias of this measure (giving too much importance to dominant 

OTUs and overseeing rare ones) by applying a square root transformation to our OTU abundance 

table prior to obtaining the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix. The selection of the index at hand was 

based on (i) its applicability to assess differences between communities using abundance data, (ii) 

its wide use in the field of ecology and microbiology for this purpose, and (iii) its suitability to answer 

our questions.  

We found considerable culturable bacterial diversity in the internal tissues of H. portulacoides from 

all sampled sites. It is widely accepted that the culturable fraction of plant-associated microbes 

corresponds to a small fraction of the real diversity, as a consequence of growth medium 

inadequacy (Tanaka et al., 2014), and limitations to reproduce optimal growth conditions. 

Nevertheless, the culture-dependent approach allows for extensive functional characterization of 

the isolates in the collection, which is not possible with culture-independent approaches. 

Additionally, traditional methods of culture-dependent techniques are useful for the determination 

of the overall effect of metal contaminants in bacterial communities (Ellis et al., 2001). 

As stated above, in our study, the number of isolates obtained from EAG and BAG samples was 

considerably lower than for other samples. Since the method for obtaining endophytic bacteria 

includes a harsh surface sterilization process, the viability of endophytes in the samples could be 

compromised. However, we do not believe this to be the main reason for such a disparity in the 

number of isolates in the different samples, since the same process was applied to all samples. The 

isolation efforts were the same for all samples, and as such, the difference in numbers of obtained 

endophytic isolates may be a reflection of these AG tissues being less populated, since the highest 

bacterial densities are usually observed in BG tissues, and decrease toward AG tissues (Lodewyckx 

et al., 2002). In fact, we observed a significantly lower average number of CFU per gram (FW) 

obtained from EAG and BAG samples, when compared with the respective BG tissues 

(Supplementary Table S3.1). This pattern was not, however, observed for AG and BG tissues from 

site C, where the CAG community presented a significantly higher average number of CFU per gram 

(FW) than CBG. This suggests that the degree of soil and plant tissue contamination could also play 

a role in the average number of culturable bacteria. This latter effect has been previously reported 

for bacterial soil communities, where the presence of metal contaminants negatively influenced 

the ability of readily culturable bacteria to replicate in laboratory media (Ellis et al., 2003). 

Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes were the phyla recognized in the 

endophytic collection from this study. This result is in accordance with studies describing the 



54 
 

phyllosphere and endosphere assemblages in other plant hosts (reviewed in Bulgarelli et al., 2013), 

including halophytes (Mora-Ruiz et al., 2015), and the rhizosphere of H. portulacoides (Oliveira et 

al., 2014b). The genera Altererythrobacter, Marinilactibacillus, Microbacterium, Salinicola, and 

Vibrio were the most abundant in our collection. To our knowledge, this is the first time an isolate 

belonging to the genus Marinilactibacillus was obtained from the endosphere. 

Isolates affiliated to the genus Altererythrobacter have been previously identified in the 

endosphere (e.g., Liu et al., 2014). In our collection, 73.5 % of isolated Altererythrobacter spp. were 

collected from contaminated sites (E and B). Some species of Altererythrobacter are described as 

able to tolerate metals (Wu et al., 2014), a trait that could be useful in the endosphere of plants 

colonizing contaminated locations. 

Marinilactibacillus spp. have been detected in marine environments (e.g., Toffin et al., 2005) and 

detected with culture-independent methods in olive fermentation brine (Lucena-Padrós et al., 

2015). Isolates belonging to this genus have also been isolated from many types of cheese, including 

as part of consortia that were able to reduce the counts of the human pathogen Listeria 

monocytogenes (e.g., Roth et al., 2010), indicating antimicrobial activities which could be useful in 

the endosphere environment.  

Isolates from the genus Microbacterium, exclusively isolated from BG tissues in this study, have 

been thoroughly characterized and detected in many environments, including the rhizosphere of 

ginseng (Kim et al., 2015) and the endosphere of crops and prairie plants (Zinniel et al., 2002). 

Recently, three novel species from this genus were described from the endosphere of H. 

portulacoides (Alves et al., 2014; Alves et al., 2015). PGP traits have been previously associated with 

this genus (see below), suggesting a high importance in the endosphere. 

Isolates from the genus Salinicola have been previously obtained from diverse environments (e.g., 

deep sea surface sediments, Romanenko et al., 2013) including the endosphere of a halophyte 

(Mora-Ruiz et al., 2015). To the best of our knowledge, PGP traits have not been explored in this 

genus. The prosperity of Salinicola spp. in marine environments could be related to their presence 

in the endosphere of the halophyte at study.  

Vibrio spp. have been abundantly detected in aquatic environments and organisms (Thompson et 

al., 2004) and in the endosphere (e.g., seagrass, Jose et al., 2014). PGP traits have been associated 

with this genus (see below), suggesting that this widely known pathogen in humans and other 

animals may have a positive role in the endosphere. 



55 
 

The genera Pseudomonas and Micrococcus, less represented in this study (15 and 9 isolates, 

respectively), were previously detected in the endosphere of H. portulacoides in a study regarding 

hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (Oliveira et al., 2014a). 

From the 462 identified isolates, 29 presented less than 97 % similarity with the closest 16S rRNA 

gene sequence in GenBank. These isolates may potentially belong to novel species, revealing the 

endosphere of H. portulacoides as a source for undescribed phylogenetic groups. 

As reviewed in Bulgarelli et al. (2013) for many plant hosts and discussed in Oliveira et al. (2014b) 

for H. portulacoides, plant-related factors contribute to the composition of plant-associated 

bacterial communities. In this work, 14 genera were isolated from all sites, suggesting the presence 

of a common structure associated to the studied halophyte. On the other hand, differences were 

observed, where considerably abundant genera were exclusively isolated from one site (e.g., 

Salinicola spp. from site C).  

In the present study, Altererythrobacter spp., Marinilactibacillus spp., Microbacterium spp., and 

Vibrio spp. isolates were abundantly detected in all sites, suggesting an ability to tolerate metals, 

which has been previously described in these genera (Wu et al., 2014; Sheng et al., 2008; Jafari et 

al., 2015) except, to the best of our knowledge, for the genus Marinilactibacillus. OTUs belonging 

to the genera Bacillus and Rhizobium, albeit less represented in the endophyte collection (11 and 6 

isolates, respectively), were considered indicator OTUs for site B, and metal tolerance has 

previously been associated with these genera (Ma et al., 2015; Aafi et al., 2015). Isolates belonging 

to Salinicola spp. (n=58) were exclusively detected in site C, and the indicator OTU for site C was 

also attributed to this genus. Information on whether Salinicola spp. can tolerate metal 

contamination is lacking in the literature; however, considering the number of isolates obtained 

from this genus and the extension of our collection, we suggest that it should be further 

investigated as to its ability as a bioindicator. 

Usually, bacteria access plant tissues through natural entry points in the root tips and lateral roots 

emergence points, as a consequence of root growth. Once inside the plant, endophytes may 

colonize the plant by migration from BG to AG tissues. Additional penetration may occur through 

natural openings on leaves such as stomata, or through leaf wounds (reviewed in Lodewyckx et al., 

2002). Here, we found that BG and AG tissues shared 20 bacterial genera, suggesting that migration 

from BG to AG tissues may occur in H. portulacoides. On the other hand, isolates belonging to the 

genera Hoeflea (17), Labrenzia (22), and Microbacterium (67) were only isolated from BG tissues, 

and the two latter genera were identified as indicator OTUs for these tissues by our indicator 



56 
 

species analysis. The genera Hoeflea and Labrenzia have been isolated from root endosphere of a 

salt marsh halophyte (Bibi et al., 2014) and, to the best of our knowledge, have not been detected 

in AG tissues of plants, as was the case in our study. On the other hand, Microbacterium spp. has 

been detected in AG tissues of H. portulacoides (e.g., Alves et al., 2014). An OTU attributed to the 

genus Zunongwangia was considered indicator OTU for AG tissues in our analysis. Although this 

genus has been isolated from the rhizosphere of mangrove trees (Rameshkumar et al., 2014) and 

detected by pyrosequencing in the endosphere (Mora-Ruiz et al., 2015), it had not been previously 

isolated in the endosphere. 

We found that the bacterial composition across our collection is significantly affected by the 

isolation site and tissue, although these factors only account for 23 % of the total variation observed 

in our data. Nevertheless, a variation in composition could be observed across the gradient of 

contamination in our sampling sites, suggesting that the contamination levels do, in fact, affect the 

composition of the culturable endosphere of H. portulacoides. Other variation parameters (e.g., soil 

water content, organic matter content, fine particle content, redox potential, pH, and conductivity; 

Válega et al., 2008b) could be explored in order to further understand the reasons for composition 

variation in the culturable endosphere of this halophyte. 

Many isolates from the collection obtained in this study tested positive for several enzymatic 

activities and PGP traits, exposing the endosphere of the halophyte H. portulacoides as a novel 

source of bacteria and bacterial compounds with potential biotechnological applications. The ability 

to produce these extracellular enzymes and PGP traits is well distributed across phylogenetic 

groups, as the most represented classes (Figure 3.1) amply exhibited all tested traits, except Bacilli 

for phosphate solubilization (Supplementary Figure S3.1). This ability is also well represented, 

overall, in all isolation sites and tissues (Figure 3.3). The ability to produce industrially important 

extracellular enzymes was abundantly detected in isolates associated to the genera 

Altererythrobacter, Marinilactibacillus, Microbacterium, and Vibrio. To our knowledge, the 

production of the tested enzymes had not been previously described in Altererythrobacter spp. and 

Marinilactibacillus spp. 

To the best of our knowledge, the PGP traits tested in the presented study were not previously 

evaluated in Altererythrobacter spp. isolates. Here, we found that isolates from this genus tested 

positive for one to six extracellular enzymatic activities and presented one to five PGP traits. Overall, 

all tested enzymes and traits were produced by isolates belonging to his genus. 



57 
 

Traits for Marinilactibacillus spp. isolates from other studies have not been deeply characterized. 

Here, we found that Marinilactibacillus spp. isolates tested positive for one to five extracellular 

enzymatic activities, and presented one to four PGP traits. Considering all the isolates from this 

genus, all of the tested enzymes and traits were produced, except pectinase at pH 5. 

The ability to promote plant growth has been previously detected in the genus Microbacterium 

with traits as ACC deaminase (Sheng et al., 2008), IAA production, phosphate solubilization (Kukla 

et al., 2014), and siderophore production (Pereira et al., 2013). The presence of the nifH gene was 

also detected (Zakhia et al., 2006). Production of protease and lipase (Pereira et al., 2013), xylanase, 

amylase (Park et al., 2006), cellulase (Kukla et al., 2014), and pectinase (Vinod et al., 2014) has been 

characterized in Microbacterium spp.. Antimicrobial activity and resistance to metals have also 

been reported in this genus (Sheng et al., 2008; Passari et al., 2015). In the present study, one to 

five of the abovementioned extracellular enzymes were also detected in all Microbacterium spp. 

isolates, as were one to four PGP traits. Considering all the isolates from this genus, all of the tested 

enzymes and traits were present. 

Previously studied Vibrio spp. exhibited enzymatic activities such as proteolytic, cellulolytic, 

amylolytic (Jose et al., 2014), xylanolytic (Kiyohara et al., 2005), and lipolytic (Ray et al., 2012), 

showed potential for plant growth promotion by solubilizing phosphate, fixing atmospheric 

nitrogen, producing IAA (Jose et al., 2014), and siderophores (Thompson et al., 2004). Vibrio spp. 

isolates from our collection tested positive for these activities and traits and, in addition, 

pectinolytic activity (at both pH=5.0 and 7.0) and ACC deaminase activity. Other studies have also 

detected antimicrobial activity (Kumar and Nair, 2007) and considerable Hg resistance and ability 

for Hg bioremediation in Vibrio spp. isolates (Jafari et al., 2015). 

IAA production was detected in 460 isolates, 17 of which produced over 100 ?g mL?1. The most 

represented IAA producing genus is Pseudomonas with five isolates, which has previously been 

associated with IAA producing potential in rice root exudates (Karnwal, 2009). Phosphate 

solubilization was detected in 64 isolates, 10 of which belong to the genus Microbacterium, and 15 

belong to the genus Salinicola. While Microbacterium spp. have been associated with phosphate 

solubilizing activity (Kukla et al., 2014), this is, to our knowledge, the first report of such activity in 

the Salinicola genus. Using PCR amplification, 20.8 % of representative isolates tested positive for 

the presence of the nifH gene. Of the 97 nifH-positive isolates, 63 originated from BG tissues and 

17 belonged to the genus Vibrio, which has previously been associated with this trait (Jose et al., 

2014). According to Penrose and Glick (2003), the ability to use ACC as a sole nitrogen source is a 



58 
 

consequence of the activity of the enzyme ACC deaminase. From the 239 isolates that were able to 

grow in DF minimal medium supplemented with ACC, 155 (64.9 %) originated from BG tissues, and 

60 % of isolates sampled in site B tested positive for this activity. Isolates associated with the genera 

Microbacterium (33) and Altererythrobacter (25) contributed the most for this PGP trait. Isolates 

from Microbacterium genus have previously been associated with ACC deaminase activity (Sheng 

et al., 2008); however, to our knowledge, this is the first description of such activity in the genus 

Altererythrobacter. Siderophore production was observed in 152 isolates (32.5 % of the collection), 

19 of which belong to the genus Vibrio, which had been previously linked to this activity (Thompson 

et al., 2004). Nineteen Marinilactibacillus spp. isolates also tested positive, which is, to our 

knowledge, the first time such activity was described in this genus. 

This work revealed that the endosphere of H. portulacoides represents a bacterial hotspot 

harboring a diverse microbiota, including putative novel species and compounds with 

biotechnological relevance. Endophytic bacteria were isolated from AG and BG tissues of the 

halophyte from contaminated and non-contaminated sites. Seventy-nine different genera were 

found using traditional cultivation methods. The phylogenetically diverse collection presented 

structural differences among sampling tissues and sites, and many of the isolates revealed their 

ability to produce extracellular enzymes and PGP traits. The PGP potential of these endophytes 

should be further characterized, aiming toward enhancing phytoextraction of metal-contaminated 

soils by H. portulacoides. The possibility of monitoring Salinicola spp. as a bioindicator of lack of 

contamination should also be further studied. Metal resistance and antimicrobial properties of 

these isolates should also be assessed to further characterize functional capabilities of the 

collection.

Abstract 

Phytoremediation assisted by bacteria is seen as a promising alternative to reduce metal 

contamination in the environment. The main goal of this study was to characterize endophytic 

Pseudomonas isolated from Halimione portulacoides, a metal-accumulator plant, in salt marshes 

contaminated with metal(loid)s. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA and gyrB genes showed 

that isolates affiliated with P. sabulinigri (n = 16), P. koreensis (n = 10), P. simiae (n = 5), P. 

seleniipraecipitans (n = 2), P. guineae (n = 2), P. migulae (n = 1), P. fragi (n = 1), P. xanthomarina (n 

= 1), and Pseudomonas sp. (n = 1). Most of these species have never been described as endophytic. 

The majority of the isolates were resistant to three or more metal(loid)s. Antibiotic resistance was 

frequent among the isolates but most likely related to species-intrinsic features. Common acquired 

antibiotic resistance genes and integrons were not detected. Plasmids were detected in 43.6 % of 

the isolates. Isolates that affiliated with different species shared the same plasmid profile but 

attempts to transfer metal resistance to receptor strains were not successful. Phosphate 

solubilization and IAA production were the most prevalent plant growth promoting traits, and 20 % 

of the isolates showed activity against phytopathogenic bacteria. Most isolates produced four or 

more extracellular enzymes. Preliminary results showed that two selected isolates promote 

Arabidopsis thaliana root elongation. Results highlight the diversity of endophytic Pseudomonas in 

H. portulacoides from contaminated sites and their potential to assist phytoremediation by acting 

as plant growth promoters and as environmental detoxifiers.

Background 

The contamination of different aquatic and terrestrial settings with metals is a complex and difficult 

to handle environmental problem (Cambrollé et al., 2012a; Rajkumar et al., 2009; Singh and 

Cameotra, 2004). Metal pollution is of major concern for human health due to the persistence of 

these elements in the environment for long periods, resulting in continuous negative impacts on 

ecosystems (Rajkumar et al., 2009; Singh and Cameotra, 2004). 

Salt marshes are one of the most productive ecosystems on Earth. Nevertheless, these ecosystems 

are recipients of industrial and municipal waste, accumulating considerable amounts of 

contaminants, including metals (Duarte et al., 2007; Mucha et al., 2011; Sousa et al., 2008). 

The strategies available to solve the problem of metal contamination include phytoremediation. 

This technique is considered effective, less expensive, and less damaging than, for example, 

chemical and physical remediation strategies (Almeida et al., 2009; Mucha et al., 2011; Weyens et 

al., 2009). Plants used in phytoremediation should have specific features, such as fast growth, and 

dense root and shoot systems. The phytoremediation of metal-contaminated sites is possible since 

some plants tolerate and accumulate high amounts of metals (Rajkumar et al., 2009). Halimione 

portulacoides is one of the most predominant and productive plants in European salt marshes and 

is already used in phytoremediation (Anjum et al., 2011; Carvalho et al., 2010; Couto et al., 2011). 

This plant has been reported as an accumulator of several metals and it has been proposed as 

biomonitor for mercury (Hg) contamination (Cambrollé et al., 2012a, b; Válega et al., 2008a).  

The phytoremediation potential of a given plant also depends on the bacterial communities that 

live in association with it. Bacteria that are present in the phytosphere may contribute to 

phytoremediation through mechanisms that enhance plant establishment, proliferation, and health 

in a polluted environment. Beneficial effects provided by bacteria include increased metal 

tolerance, production of plant growth promoters (PGP), and antimicrobial activity against 

phytopathogens (Rajkumar et al., 2009). The contribution may be more direct since, for instance, 

some bacteria can modify the metals and thus facilitate absorption by the plant (Aguilar-Barajas et 

al., 2010; Ullah et al., 2015).  

The genus Pseudomonas includes bacteria that can be found in a variety of ecological niches such 

as soil, water, and in association with plants and animals (Spiers et al., 2000). Pseudomonas spp. 

are a highly diverse and adaptable group, including human pathogens (e.g., Pseudomonas 

aeruginosa; Poole, 2011) and plant pathogens (e.g., Pseudomonas syringae; Tarkowski and 



87 
 

Vereecke, 2014). Association of Pseudomonas strains with plants has been referred as beneficial 

through their PGP effect (Ganeshan and Kumar, 2005). Despite this, endophytic Pseudomonas have 

been poorly explored regarding their potential to promote bioremediation when associated with 

plants. 

The objective of this study was to characterize endophytic Pseudomonas isolates of H. portulacoides 

from salt marshes contaminated with metals. Isolates were comprehensively characterized with 

respect to their phylogenetic diversity, PGP effect, and resistance/tolerance to metals and 

antibiotics.

Methods 

Endophytic Pseudomonas strains 

A collection of endophytic bacterial isolates was obtained in the scope of previous investigations 

(Fidalgo et al., 2016; Martins, 2011). Bacterial isolates were retrieved from above (AG) and 

belowground (BG) tissues of H. portulacoides in metal-contaminated salt marshes (sites B and E) of 

the estuary Ria de Aveiro in the northwest coast of Portugal. Previous studies have shown that site 

B, being closest to the industrial effluent discharge point, showed higher metal(loid)s content than 

site E (Válega et al., 2008b). Bacterial isolation methodology is described in detail by Fidalgo et al. 

(2016). Briefly, samples were washed with tap water and for endophytic bacteria isolation, AG and 

BG tissues from each plant were used. Plant surface was sterilized by sequentially immersing 

samples in 50 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min, 96 % ethanol during 1 min, 5 % 

NaOCl 30 min, 96 % ethanol 1 min, and rinsing in distilled water three times. Sterilization was 

confirmed by inoculating water from the last wash in adequate culture medium. Afterwards, tissues 

were then ground with a pestle in a mortar containing 10 mL of PBS; dilutions were prepared and 

spread on Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA, Merck, Germany), Marine Agar (MA, Difco, France), and R2A Agar 

(Merck, Germany) culture media. The plates were incubated up to 72 h at 28 °C and observed for 

colony forming units count every 24 h. Endophytic bacterial colonies observed as distinct 

morphologically were selected, purified, and stored at ?80 °C in 20 % glycerol.  

After molecular typing by BOX-PCR, representative isolates were identified at the genus level by 

sequencing about 800 bp of the 16S rRNA gene (Fidalgo et al., 2016; Martins, 2011). Isolates 

identified as Pseudomonas (n = 39) were selected for further analysis in the scope of the present 

study. 

 

Phylogenetic analysis 

Phylogenetic diversity within the collection of Pseudomonas isolates was assessed using nearly full-

length 16S rRNA gene sequences. For this, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified with primers and PCR 

conditions described before (Tacão et al., 2015). Similarity searches were performed with the BLAST 

software (Altschul et al., 1990) against the GenBank database. Closest relatives were also 

determined with the EZTaxon tool available at http://www.ezbiocloud.net/eztaxon (Kim et al., 

2012). Additionally, gyrB gene of Pseudomonas isolates was sequenced, using PCR primers and 

conditions described elsewhere (Yamamoto et al., 2000). 



89 
 

Maximum-likelihood and neighbor-joining trees were constructed based on the concatenated 

sequences of 16S rRNA and gyrB genes of isolates. Sequences of the corresponding genes of closest 

relative type strains of Pseudomonas spp. (according to BLAST and EzTaxon results) were used to 

construct phylogenetic trees using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis version 6.0 (MEGA6; 

Tamura et al., 2013). Kimura-2-parameter was used as the model of DNA sequence evolution. The 

branch numbers refer to bootstrap confidence values obtained using 1000 replications. 

 

Metal tolerance assays 

Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined in Luria-Bertani (LB, Fisher BioReagents, 

Belgium) agar supplemented with arsenic (As; 50, 100, 300, and 600 ?g mL-1 As as Na2AsO4), 

chromium (Cr III; 50, 100, 300, and 600 ?g mL-1 Cr as CrCl3?6H2O), copper (Cu; 100, 300, 400, 600, 

and 1000 ?g mL-1 Cu as CuSO4?5H2O), mercury (Hg; 5, 100, 150, 250, and 400 ?g mL-1 Hg as HgCl2), 

nickel (Ni; 50, 100, 300, and 600 ?g mL-1 Ni as NiSO4?6H2O), and zinc (Zn; 50, 100,300, and 600 ?g 

mL-1 Zn as ZnCl2). Metal(loid) stock solutions were prepared in distilled water and sterilized. 

Experiments were conducted in triplicate. Results were registered after 5 days incubation at 30 °C. 

The reference strain Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was included for quality control. Since there are 

no standard interpretative criteria for the classification of bacterial isolates as susceptible or 

resistant to metals, thresholds were defined based on previous studies (Nies, 1999; Malik and 

Aleem, 2011). Hence, the sensitivity thresholds considered were 600 ?g mL-1 for As, 20 ?g mL-1 for 

Hg, 250 ?g mL-1 for Cr, and 300 ?g mL-1 for Cu, Ni, and Zn. 

 

Antibiotic susceptibility assays 

Isolates were tested for susceptibility to 16 antibiotics using the disk diffusion method on Mueller-

Hinton Agar (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK), following the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 

guidelines (CLSI 2012). The tested antibiotics were cefepime (FEP, 30 ?g), ampicillin (AMP, 10 ?g), 

amoxicillin (AML, 10 ?g), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC, 20 ?g/10 ?g), piperacillin (PRL, 100 ?g), 

aztreonam (ATM, 30 ?g), piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP, 100 ?g/10 ?g), cefotaxime (CTX, 30 ?g), 

ceftazidime (CAZ, 30 ?g), imipenem (IPM, 10 ?g); tetracycline (TE, 30 ?g), gentamicin (CN, 10 ?g), 

tobramycin (TOB, 10 ?g), ciprofloxacin (CIP, 5 ?g), chloramphenicol (C, 30 ?g), and 

sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SXT, 25 ?g). After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, organisms were 

classified as sensitive, intermediate, or resistant according to the CLSI guidelines. The E. coli ATCC 



90 
 

25922 was used as quality control. Cluster analysis of the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of 

Pseudomonas isolates was performed using Bray-Curtis similarity coefficient and Unweighted Pair 

Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) algorithm. For this, matrices were constructed 

considering isolates classification as resistant (2), intermediate resistant (1), or susceptible (0) to 

antibiotics. 

 

Plant growth promoting trait assays 

All isolates were screened in triplicate for different PGP activities: 1-aminocyclopropane-1-

carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, phosphate solubilization, indole acetic acid (IAA), siderophore 

production, nitrogen fixation, and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) production. ACC deaminase activity was 

determined by growing isolates in DF salt minimal medium (Dworkin and Foster, 1958) 

supplemented with 3 mM ACC (DF+ACC) or 2 g L-1 (NH4)2SO4 (DF+Ammonium Sulfate) or no nitrogen 

source (DF). The ability to use ACC as a sole nitrogen source is a consequence of the activity of the 

enzyme ACC deaminase (Penrose and Glick, 2003). Phosphate solubilization was observed as a clear 

halo around bacterial growth on National Botanical Research Institute’s Phosphate (NBRIP) solid 

growth medium (Nautiyal, 1999). IAA production was tested by the method described by Gordon 

and Weber (1951). Siderophore production was evaluated after inoculation in TSA medium 

followed by an overlay with O-CAS (Pérez-Miranda et al., 2007; Pérez-Miranda and Fernández, 

2013) after incubation for 16 h at 30 °C. Bacterial growth overlaid with CAS was incubated for 2 h 

at room temperature. Siderophore production was identified as a change of color of the overlay 

from blue to orange or purple. Nitrogen fixing capacity was evaluated by PCR, targeting nifH gene 

with primers and conditions described elsewhere (Ando et al., 2005). HCN production was 

evaluated streaking the isolates on Pseudomonas agar base (Liofilchem, Italy) supplemented with 

4.4 g L-1 glycine. A sterile filter paper was soaked with a picric acid solution (2.5 g L-1 picric acid and 

12.5 g L-1 Na2CO3 on distilled water) and placed on the upper lid of each plate. The plates were 

sealed with parafilm and incubated during 48 h at 30 °C (Reetha et al., 2014). HCN production was 

qualitatively identified as a change of color of the filter paper from yellow to light brown, brown, 

and reddish brown. Pseudomonas putida EAPC8 and Pseudomonas fluorescens S3X were used as 

positive controls for IAA production. For phosphate solubilization “Pseudomonas reactans” EDP28, 

P. putida EAPC8, Arthrobacter rombi EC32A, and P. fluorescens S3X were used as negative controls, 

and Arthrobacter nicotinovorans EAPAA and Rhodococcus sp. EC35 were used as positive controls. 

For siderophore production “P. reactans” EDP28, P. putida EAPC8, A. rombi EC32A, P. fluorescens 



91 
 

S3X, A. nicotinovorans EAPAA, and Rhodococcus sp. EC35 were used as positive controls (Pereira et 

al., 2015). Rahnella aquatilis (HQ538817; Proença et al., 2010) was used as a positive control and E. 

coli ATCC 25922 was used as a negative control (Gaby and Buckley, 2012). Pseudomonas putida 

EAPC8 and A. rombi EC32A were used as positive controls for the ACC deaminase activity tests. For 

HCN production, a plate without bacterial suspension was used as negative control. 

 

Antimicrobial activity assays 

Antimicrobial activity was tested against six indicator strains from genera that include 

phytopathogenic members, isolated from H. portulacoides in the scope of previous studies 

(Martins, 2011) or obtained from private collections: Wautersia (W. eutropha NR92), 

Agrobacterium (A. tumefaciens NR163SFP) Pantoea (Pantoea brenneri PA112, Pantoea eucalypti 

RZ12) Erwinia (Erwinia rhapontici RZ93), and Curtobacterium (Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens 

PA10). Assays were performed in TSA medium. The indicator strain was inoculated in TSA plates 

and left at room temperature for 30 min. These plates were then inoculated with 5 ?L of a bacterial 

suspension of the collection of endophytic bacteria in NaCl 0.9 % (1 McFarland) and incubated at 

30 °C for 16 h. Antimicrobial activity was observed according to the presence (positive result) or 

absence (negative result) of a halo surrounding the bacterial growth (Prado et al., 2009).  

 

Enzymatic assays 

All isolates were screened, in triplicate, for the following enzymatic activities: amylolytic, 

cellulolytic, lipolytic, pectinolytic, proteolytic, and xylanolytic. For enzymatic activity screening, 

bacterial isolates were streaked on TSA culture medium supplemented with appropriate substrate: 

0.2 % starch for amylolytic activity, 0.5 % carboxymethyl cellulose for cellulolytic activity, 1 % Tween 

20 for lipolytic, 0.5 % pectin for pectinolytic, 1 % skim milk for proteolytic, and 0.5 % xylan for 

xylanolytic activity. Amylolytic activity was detected when a clear halo was observed upon addition 

of Lugol solution after bacterial growth. Cellulolytic and xylanolytic activities were detected when 

a clear halo was observed upon incubation in TSA with Congo red solution (1 % Congo red, with 10 

% ethanol) and subsequent wash with 1 M NaCl. Lipolytic activity was observed by the formation 

of a white precipitate around the bacterial growth. Pectinolytic activity was detected by formation 

of a clear halo after addition of 1 % hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solution. 

Proteolytic activity was revealed by visualization of a clear halo against an opaque background. The 



92 
 

results were interpreted according to the visibility of the halo obtained: negative, no halo observed; 

positive, faint to intense halo observed.  

 

Effect of bacteria inoculation on Arabidopsis thaliana root elongation 

The effect of bacterial inoculation on A. thaliana root growth was evaluated using a protocol based 

on Shi et al. (2010). The disinfection of the A. thaliana seeds was processed in sterile microtubes 

with 500 ?L of a mixture of 70 % ethanol and 0.05 % Tween 20, followed by 5 min incubation at 

room temperature. The supernatant was aspirated with a micropipette and 500 ?L of 100 % ethanol 

were added. After an incubation of 5 min at room temperature, the ethanol was discarded. The 

disinfected seeds (n = 15) were spread in a single line on half strength Murashige and Skoog medium 

(MS, Duchefa Biochemie, The Netherlands), supplemented with 1.5 % glucose and 0.8 % agar and 

the plates were incubated, vertically, for 3 days at 4 °C, to promote germination. A bacterial cell 

suspension on LB broth (OD600 = 0.6–0.8) was pelleted during 1 min at 13000 rpm and resuspended 

in 1 mL of half strength MS medium supplemented with 1.5 % glucose and without agar. Sterile 

filter papers with 1 cm diameter were placed at 2 cm distance from the seeds line with 50 ?L of 

bacterial suspension. Plates were incubated, vertically, at 24 °C under a 16/8 h light-dark cycle. The 

tests were performed in triplicate and a negative control without bacterial suspension was 

included. At the end of the incubation period, 15 roots were measured and statistical analysis was 

performed. The normality of the distribution of the root measurements was assessed with Shapiro’s 

normality test (shapiro.test). If a normal distribution was observed then the significance of the 

differences for each treatment against the control was assessed with t student test (t.test). Tests 

were performed using the stats package in R (R Core Team, 2014). 

 

PCR screening for integrons, metal, and antibiotic resistance genes 

Genes conferring resistance to beta-lactams (blaSHV, blaTEM, blaCTX-M, blaGES, blaKPC, blaVIM, blaIMP, 

blaOXA-2-like, blaOXA-10-like, blaOXA-30-like), sulphonamides (sul1), and chloramphenicol (cat) were 

inspected by PCR. Integrase screening was performed for intI1 and intI2 genes. All experiments 

included positive controls and also a PCR mixture containing water instead of DNA as negative 

control. Primers and PCR conditions are listed in Supplementary Table S3.4.

Mercury resistance gene merA (encoding a mercuric reductase) was inspected by PCR. Primers and 

conditions were used as previously described (Deredjian et al., 2011). 

 

Plasmid profiles and replicon typing 

Bacterial plasmid DNA was extracted with E.Z.N.A. Plasmid Mini Kit II (Omega Bio-tek, GA, USA). 

Plasmid diversity was analyzed by restriction analysis using 5 U of PstI (CTGCA?G) and 5 U of 

Bst1770I (GTA?TAC), according to the manufacturer’s instruc?ons (Fermentas, Lithuania). 

Restriction patterns were visualized in 0.8 % agarose gels (electrophoresis run at 40 V for 3 h) 

stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized with the Molecular Imager® Gel Doc™ XR System 

and Image Lab™ Software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Restriction patterns were matched using 

GelCompar II software (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium). 

Replicon typing was performed by PCR for detection of FIA, FIB, FIC, HI1, HI2, I1-Ig, L/M, N, P, W, T, 

A/C, K, B/O, X, Y, F, and FIIA replicons, using primers and conditions described by Carattoli et al. 

(2005).  

Conjugation experiments were performed for selected isolates that showed resistance to Hg. This 

metal was chosen since study sites were subjected to Hg-rich industrial discharges for four decades 

(1950s–1990s, Costa and Jesus-Rydin, 2001). For that, log-phase cultures of donor isolates and the 

recipient strain E. coli CV601 were mixed at a 1:1 ratio in LB (Merck, Germany) broth and incubated 

at 30 °C for 24 h without shaking. Transconjugant selection was performed with LB agar plates with 

50 ?g mL-1 rifampicin and 25 ?g mL-1 Hg as HgCl2.

Results and Discussion 

The environmental contamination with metals is a worldwide problem. The use of plants to remove 

metals from polluted environments, i.e., phytoremediation, is seen as a promising alternative. 

Endophytic bacteria, which colonize internal tissues of plants without causing damage to the host, 

have been reported as facilitators of phytoremediation processes (Compant et al., 2010), by 

promoting the proliferation of plants in contaminated sites.  

The genus Pseudomonas is a diverse microbial group that, due to its high genome plasticity, is able 

to adapt to severe environments and to degrade or tolerate a range of natural and synthetic 

compounds (Aguilar-Barajas et al., 2010). Additionally, members of this genus were reported to 

efficiently promote plant growth (Preston, 2004). In this study, we analyzed endophytic 

Pseudomonas isolates associated to the salt marsh plant H. portulacoides from metal(loid)-polluted 

sites. 

Though the potential of this plant for remediation of metal-polluted sites has been recognized, its 

phytosphere has never been explored to identify bacterial strains that may contribute to this 

decontamination. Also, the specificities of salt marshes (e.g., high salinity, tide variation) justify the 

need to identify indigenous bacterial strains that can be used for phytoremediation in this particular 

environment. 

 

Phylogenetic diversity of endophytic Pseudomonas isolates 

A collection of 39 previously obtained endophytic isolates of Pseudomonas (Fidalgo et al., 2016; 

Martins, 2011) was used in this study. While in the study conducted by Martins et al. (samples 

collected in 2010), Pseudomonas was the predominant genus (46 % of the total number of isolates); 

in the study conducted by Fidalgo et al. (samples collected in 2012), Pseudomonas isolates 

represented only 2 % of the total number of isolates. The most common genera in the last study 

were Microbacterium and Salinicola representing 10 and 9 % of the collection, respectively. 

Differences in Pseudomonas prevalence between studies are probably related with the use of 

different culture media. While TSA was used in both studies, Fidalgo et al. used also Marine Agar 

and R2A Agar. Marine Agar presents a high salt content thus favoring isolation and cultivation of 

marine bacteria. R2A agar is a low nutrient medium specifically designed to cultivate oligotrophic 

bacteria. On the contrary, TSA may select for fast-growing heterotrophic bacteria including many 

Pseudomonas strains.

Detailed phylogenetic analysis of the Pseudomonas isolates used in the present study (n = 39) is 

presented in Figure 3.4. The phylogenetic tree based on neighbor-joining method was constructed 

using concatenated 16S rRNA and gyrB gene sequences from all isolates and from closest related 

Pseudomonas spp. type strains. Affiliation of the isolates was based on well-supported 

monospecific clades (bootstrap values above 50 %) in the obtained phylogenetic tree. Based on this 

criterion, isolates affiliated with the closest related species Pseudomonas sabulinigri (n = 16), 

Pseudomonas koreensis (n = 10), Pseudomonas simiae (n = 5), Pseudomonas seleniipraecipitans (n 

= 2), Pseudomonas guineae (n = 2), Pseudomonas migulae (n = 1), Pseudomonas fragi (n = 1), and 

Pseudomonas xanthomarina (n = 1). One isolate (RZ32) grouped with sequences from two different 

species in the same clade. Phylogenetic trees constructed using a different method, maximum-

likelihood, showed identical affiliation (data not shown). Although the applied methodology 

allowed affiliating most isolates to a closest related species, further analysis must be conducted to 

confirm identification at species level. Multigene sequence analyses of 16S rRNA, ITS, gyrB, and 

rpoD have proven useful for Pseudomonas species identification. Furthermore, the basis to describe 

new bacterial species has been DNA-DNA hybridization. However, the fact that many isolates 

grouped in distinct clusters, distant to the closest type strain, suggests that these isolates probably 

represent undescribed Pseudomonas species.  

Results suggest a high diversity of endophytic Pseudomonas spp. associated to the plant H. 

portulacoides. Although plant association is widely recognized among pseudomonads (Preston, 

2004), studies reporting endophytic Pseudomonas spp. are rare (Ryan et al., 2008; Rajkumar et al., 

2009). In fact, the majority of the species retrieved during this study have not been described before 

as endophytic. Exceptions were P. koreensis (Babu et al., 2015) and P. migulae (Ali et al., 2014). 

Pseudomonas koreensis has also been described as epiphytic (Lopez-Velasco et al., 2012). 

Pseudomonas koreensis and P. migulae were previously isolated from Miscanthus sinensis 

rhizosphere in metal(loid)-contaminated sites (Babu et al., 2015; Chaturvedi et al., 2006). 

Clearly, isolates affiliating with P. koreensis and P. sabulinigri were more prevalent among our 

collection. Pseudomonas sabulinigri has previously been isolated from black beach sand (Kim et al., 

2009), while P. koreensis has been isolated from multiple sources, and includes biosurfactant-

producing strains (Babu et al., 2015; Lopez-Velasco et al., 2012; Toribio et al., 2011).

Metal tolerance, susceptibility to antibiotics, and plasmid profiling 

Endophytic bacteria may play an important role in enhancing the capability of plants to extract 

metals from polluted environments (Rajkumar et al., 2009). Tolerance to metal(loid)s (Hg, Ni, Cu, 

Cr, As, Zn) was studied in Pseudomonas isolates. The metal(loid) concentrations tested were higher 

than the maximum contamination limits suggested by the European Regulatory Standards (EURS) 

for European soils (Anyakora et al., 2013; Wuana and Okieimen, 2011). Additionally, these 

concentrations were higher than those reported for soil and plant tissues in the sampled sites 

(Fidalgo et al., 2016). 

Bacterial tolerance to Hg, Cu, and As was high, with 100, 92, and 82 % of tolerant isolates, 

respectively (Figure 3.5). A lower percentage of tolerant isolates was observed for Ni (26 %) and for 

Cr (15 %). Tolerance to Zn was not observed. Overall, the order of metal(loid) tolerance among the 

isolates was Hg&gt;As&gt;Cu&gt;Ni&gt;Cr&gt;Zn. The majority (82 %) of the isolates were tolerant to three or more 

metal(loid)s. Three isolates (PA100 closely related to P. seleniipraecipitans, 9PA12 closely related 

to P. xanthomarina, and 10R43 closely related to P. sabulinigri) showed tolerance to five 

metal(loid)s. 

Pseudomonas have developed tolerance mechanisms against several metal(loid)s including 

micronutrient cations (Cu, Ni, and Zn), toxic cations (Hg), and toxic oxyanions (As and Cr) (Aguilar-

Barajas et al., 2010; Stout and Nüsslein, 2010). A comparative genomics study (Wu et al., 2011), 

which included endophytic and rhizospheric P. putida strains, revealed that the endophytic strain 

presented the highest number of genes related to metal(loid) tolerance. Most of these genes were 

located in genomic islands. Thus, the endophytic strain seemed best equipped for dealing with 

metal(loid)-related pressure than its rhizospheric relative. In accordance, the endophytic P. putida 

strain tolerated the highest concentrations of metal(loid)s (Wu et al., 2011). 

Isolates were most generally tolerant to Hg. One of the most common tolerance mechanisms to Hg 

is the reduction of this metal from the toxic cationic form to the volatile form. This 

biotransformation was described in several Pseudomonas species such as P. fluorescens, P. putida, 

and Pseudomonas stutzeri and is mediated by an Hg reductase encoded by merA gene located in 

the mer operon (Aguilar-Barajas et al., 2010). Even though we conducted a PCR screening for the 

merA gene, no positive results were obtained. It is plausible that the Hg-tolerance phenotypes here 

observed may be related to other mechanisms such as efflux systems, also commonly reported in 

Pseudomonas (Aguilar-Barajas et al., 2010).

portulacoides, using Bray-Curtis similarity coefficient and unweighted pair group method, using arithmetic 

averages cluster methods. Results of metal(loid) tolerance assays are also presented. AMP, ampicillin; PRL,

mercury; Cu, copper; As, arsenic; Ni, nickel; Zn, zinc; Cr, chromium. 

 

Pseudomonas spp. tolerance to metals is extremely variable (Xu et al., 2015; Malik and Jaiswal, 

2000; Shamim and Rehman, 2013). Endophytic P. koreensis isolates were reported to tolerate 

concentrations of Zn and As 30 and 4.5 times higher, respectively, than concentrations tolerated by 

our isolates (Babu et al., 2015). Those isolates were obtained from soil with concentrations of Zn 

and As 36 and 39 times higher than those reported for our sampling sites (Babu et al., 2015; Fidalgo 

et al., 2016). These results suggest that Pseudomonas community may adapt, to a certain limit, to 

deal with the metal(loid) pressure present in each environment. 

Tolerance to metal(loid)s may be accompanied by antibiotic resistance mechanisms that can be 

combined physiologically (cross-resistance) or genetically (co-resistance; Baker-Austin et al., 2006). 

Thus, the use of metal(loid)-tolerant Pseudomonas strains in phytoremediation may contribute to 

the spread of antibiotic resistance. From our collection, antibiotic susceptibility tests (Figure 3.5) 

showed higher resistance levels against penicillins, namely ampicillin and amoxicillin, to which 87 

and 79 % of the isolates, respectively, were resistant. For non-beta-lactam antibiotics, higher 

resistance was observed to chloramphenicol (33 %) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (18 %). 



99 
 

Clustering analysis of all antibiotic resistance (Figure 3.5) resulted in a dendrogram where three 

main clusters were identified, corresponding to (i) isolates closely related to P. sabulinigri, P. 

guineae, P. fragi, P. seleniipraecipitans, and P. simiae, (ii) isolates closely related to P. koreensis, P. 

simiae, and P. migulae, and (iii) isolates closely related to P. sabulinigri, P. xanthomarina, and 

Pseudomonas sp.. Although a few exceptions could be identified in the dendrogram (e.g., not all 

isolates affiliated with P. sabulinigri grouped in the same cluster and a similar result was observed 

for P. simiae), the distribution of antibiotic resistance profiles was mostly consistent with the 

phylogenetic affiliation, suggesting that the observed antibiotic resistance is part of the intrinsic 

characteristics of each species. This hypothesis is corroborated by the fact that common acquired 

antibiotic resistance genes were not detected in the analyzed isolates.  

Antibiotic multiresistance was observed for 13 % of the isolates, showing an intermediate or 

resistant phenotype at least to three classes of antibiotics. Regarding resistance mechanisms to 

antibiotics, P. aeruginosa is the most studied species in the genus Pseudomonas, due to its clinical 

importance. Multiresistance has been commonly reported in this species (Mesaros et al., 2007; 

Tacão et al., 2015) resulting from combinations of two or more resistance mechanisms (Livermore, 

2001; Mesaros et al., 2007). These include overexpression of efflux pumps with wide substrate 

specificity, reduced outer membrane permeability, and/or high-level expression of ?-lactamases 

(Livermore, 2001; Mesaros et al., 2007).  

Acquired antibiotic resistance and metal(loid) resistance may be encoded in mobile genetic 

elements such as integrons and/or plasmids (Tacão et al., 2014). Integrase screening performed for 

intI1 and intI2 genes gave no positive results. Plasmidic DNA was identified in 17 out of 39 isolates 

(43.6 %) and enzymatic restriction analysis resulted in 10 different profiles. Plasmidic DNA 

restriction profiles were not species-specific since the same pattern (100 % identity) was obtained 

from isolates affiliated to different species (Figure 3.6). One banding profile was identified in both 

11R35 (closely related to P. sabulinigri) and RZ31 (closely related to P. koreensis). Additionally, an 

identical restriction pattern was observed for two isolates closely related to P. sabulinigri (12R50 

and PA4), RZ85 (affiliated with P. simiae), and PA100 (affiliated with P. seleniipraecipitans). Finally, 

identical profile was observed for two isolates closely related to P. sabulinigri (RZ27 and RZ39) and 

RZ56 (affiliated with P. fragi). These results suggest that different endophytic Pseudomonas species 

may share similar replicons. Conjugation assays were performed for Hg-resistant isolates but did 

not result in transconjugants and thus it was not possible to confirm the conjugative nature of such 

replicons.

cluster methods. 

 

Plant growth promoting activity 

In addition to conferring plants higher tolerance to metal (loid)s, endophytic bacteria play a key role 

in promoting plant growth through the acquisition of nutrients by nitrogen fixation and phosphate 

solubilization, and through the production of growth regulators such as IAA, siderophores, ACC 

deaminase, and HCN production (Chauhan et al., 2015; Long et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2011). The 

presence of PGP traits was assessed for all isolates. Each isolate displayed at least one PGP trait 

(Table 3.4). Prevalent PGP traits were IAA production (100 % of the isolates were positive for this 

trait), phosphate solubilization (90 % of the isolates), and HCN production (59 % of the isolates). 

Isolates producing concentrations of IAA higher than 100 ?g mL-1 were considered good producers, 

and represented 44 % of the collection. A lower fraction of isolates (44 %) was able to produce 

siderophores. PGP traits such as ACC-deaminase production (3 %) and the presence of nifH gene (5 

%) were rarer in our collection. PGP traits were not species-specific, as can be observed in Table 

3.4. 

IAA is a phytohormone that increases plants biomass, thus contributing to increased metal 

accumulation in plants (Stout and Nüsslein, 2010). Bacterial fixation of atmospheric nitrogen and 

phosphate solubilization help plants in nutrient acquisition (Long et al., 2008). HCN promotes plant 



101 
 

growth preventing the damaging effect of phytopathogenic organisms (Chauhan et al., 2015). ACC 

deaminase lowers plant ethylene levels and improves plant growth in metal polluted conditions 

(Stout and Nüsslein, 2010). Siderophores, as chelating agents, protect plants, enabling them to 

resist to the hazardous effects of metals (Stout and Nüsslein, 2010). 

In previous studies, the most common PGP traits detected in Pseudomonas spp. were ACC 

deaminase activity, siderophores, and IAA production, which are mainly involved in plant root and 

shoot elongation and metal uptake (Ma et al., 2011). Several Pseudomonas spp. have also been 

described as good phosphate solubilizers (Rajkumar et al., 2009) and HCN production is also 

common among pseudomonads (Pereira et al., 2016). In the present study, we observed that the 

majority of the isolates produced IAA, HCN, siderophores, and solubilized phosphate. This suggests 

that Pseudomonas strains in the endosphere may help plants accumulate metals, since plant 

biomass is increased, and metal toxicity to the plant is attenuated. 

 

Enzymatic and antimicrobial activity 

Metal-tolerant bacterial strains have been reported as biological control agents, presenting 

antimicrobial activity against pathogenic fungi, bacteria, insects, and other organisms (Compant et 

al., 2010; Pereira et al., 2015). 

Here, we evaluated antimicrobial activity against representatives of phytopathogenic bacteria. 

Antagonistic activity was observed in 20 % of the isolates, as shown in Table 3.4. RZ39 and RZ38 

(closely related to P. sabulinigri), Z4 and RZ98 (affiliated with P. koreensis), and Pseudomonas sp. 

RZ32 showed antimicrobial activity against one tested strain. RZ31 (affiliated with P. koreensis) and 

RZ109 (affiliated with P. simiae) showed antimicrobial activity against two tested strains, and RZ1 

(affiliated with P. simiae) against three test strains. These isolates may have a relevant role as 

biological control agents by protecting the plant against phytopathogens. So far, the evaluation of 

plant-associated pseudomonads as biocontrol agents has been mostly focused on P. fluorescens 

isolates, which have been proven to play an important role in antifungal activity (Petatán-Sagahón 

et al., 2011; Ganeshan and Kumar, 2005).

The production of cell wall lytic enzymes, such as proteases, pectinases, and lipases may be also 

involved in antimicrobial activity against pathogens, being beneficial to the plant and relevant in 

the endosphere (Compant et al., 2010; Pereira et al., 2015). Isolates were studied regarding their 

enzymatic activity. It was observed that most isolates produced xylanases (95 %), cellulases (87 %), 

pectinases (82 %), and amylases (82 %) (Table 3.4). Protease and lipase activities were observed in 

lower percentages of the isolates, 33 and 31 %, respectively. In addition to the importance to plant 

growth and health, endophytic Pseudomonas may also be interesting sources of enzymes for the 

industry. 

 

Effect of strain inoculation on A. thaliana root development 

Due to their performance in terms of metal tolerance, PGP traits and antimicrobial and enzymatic 

activity, isolates PA100 (closely related to P. seleniipraecipitans), and RZ1 (affiliated with P. simiae) 

were selected to test their effect on A. thaliana root development. Both strains showed a positive 

effect on root development. Length of A. thaliana roots when inoculated with PA100 and RZ1, was 

on average 1.2 and 1.3 times higher than the length of roots of control plants (Figure 3.7). 

Differences between inoculated and control plants were significant for PA100 (p-value &amp;lt;0.05) and 

RZ1 (p-value &amp;lt;0.05). Strain RZ1 showed a significantly stronger positive effect on A. thaliana root 

development when compared to PA100 (p-value &amp;lt;0.05).

Conclusions 

This work highlights the diversity of endophytic Pseudomonas in H. portulacoides from metal(loid)-

contaminated sites and their potential to be applied as facilitators of phytoremediation processes. 

Metal(loid) tolerance was common among analyzed isolates. Antibiotic resistance traits were 

mostly related with intrinsic characteristics of the species, and evidence of co-selection by 

metal(loid)s was not gathered.  

Traits with potential benefits to plants, such as the production of PGP, production of enzymes, and 

activity against phytopathogens, were also observed in endophytic Pseudomonas. For example, 

isolate PA100 was tolerant to five metal(loid)s (Hg, As, Cu, Cr, and Ni), produced three PGP traits, 

presented antimicrobial activity against three representatives of phytophatogenic bacteria, and 

produced all tested enzymes. Isolate RZ1 was tolerant to two metals, produced three PGP traits, 

four enzymes and showed antimicrobial activity against three representatives of plant pathogens. 

Preliminary results show that these isolates promote A. thaliana root elongation. As demonstrated 

previously, bacterial strains may be used to inoculate plants in order to promote growth and/or 

help detoxify the environment (Rajkumar et al., 2009), thus potentially contributing for 

phytoremediation efficacy. The potential of the isolates characterized in this study for 

phytoremediation should be further tested in vivo in H. portulacoides.

Abstract 

Three actinobacterial strains were isolated from roots of the salt-marsh plant Halimione 

portulacoides collected in Ria de Aveiro, Portugal. Molecular typing using enterobacterial repetitive 

intergenic consensus ERIC-PCR fingerprinting showed the strains to be highly similar. Phylogenetic 

analyses based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence and multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) using 

gyrB, rpoB, recA and ppk and 16S rRNA genes sequences showed that the strains represented a 

member of the genus Microbacterium, with Microbacterium lacus DSM 18910T as the closest 

phylogenetic relative. DNA–DNA hybridization between strain RZ63T and its closest relative was 

below 70 %, supporting the hypothesis that it represented a distinct genomic species. 

Chemotaxonomic analyses of the novel strains and their DNA G+C contents confirmed their 

affiliation to the genus Microbacterium, however, the peptidoglycan of RZ63T contained 

diaminobutyric acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. In addition, physiological and fatty acid analyses 

revealed differences between these strains and their phylogenetic relatives, reinforcing their status 

as a distinct species. Based on the physiological, genetic and chemotaxonomic characterization it is 

proposed that the strains studied represent a novel species of the genus Microbacterium for which 

the name Microbacterium diaminobutyricum sp. nov. is proposed (type strain RZ63T=DSM 

27101T=CECT 8355T).

Main text 

The genus Microbacterium includes a very large number of species (over 90) that have been isolated 

from a wide diversity of environments including plant-associated habitats. For example, 

Microbacterium foliorum and Microbacterium phyllosphaerae were isolated from the phyllosphere 

of grasses (Behrendt et al., 2001). Madhaiyan et al. (2010) described Microbacterium azadirachtae, 

a plant growth promoting bacterium, from the rhizoplane of Azadirachta indica seedlings. Karojet 

et al. (2012) described Microbacterium yannicii isolated from roots of Arabidopsis thaliana. In 

addition, endophytic strains of members of the genus Microbacterium have been isolated from 

different plants, such as sweet corn (Zea mays), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) (McInroy &amp;amp; Kloepper, 

1995), marigolds (Tagetes erecta and T. patula) (Sturz &amp;amp; Kimpinski, 2004), switchgrass (Panicum 

virgatum) (Gagne-Bourgue et al., 2013) and wild legumes (Zakhia et al., 2006).  

The halophyte Halimione portulacoides (sea purslane) is a common and abundant species in salt 

marshes. This plant is known to sequestrate and tolerate high concentrations of toxic metals found 

in salt marsh sediments, namely mercury (Hg), and has been proposed as a bioindicator and 

biomonitor for Hg-contamination (Válega et al., 2008). Furthermore, this halophyte appears to be 

suitable for phytoremediation of Hg-contaminated salt marshes (Anjum et al., 2011). 

It is recognised that endophytic bacteria establish complex, intimate and dynamic interactions with 

their plant hosts, having effects on fundamental aspects such as plant growth and health as well as 

promotion of stress resistance (Berg et al., 2014). A study of the culturable endophytic bacteria of 

H. portulacoides in the salt marsh Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) unveiled a phylogenetically and 

functionally diverse microbiota (Fidalgo et al., 2016). Among the 79 bacterial genera identified, 

Microbacterium arose as one of the most abundant and diverse especially in Hg-contaminated sites. 

Thus, the endosphere of H. portulacoides appears to represent a hotspot of diversity for the genus 

Microbacterium. This is corroborated by the recent description of three novel endophytic 

Microbacterium species (M. endophyticum, M. halimionae and M. proteolyticum) from H. 

portulacoides (Alves et al., 2014, 2015). 

The aim of this study was to carry out a detailed taxonomic characterization of three novel isolates 

of endophytic Microbacterium isolates obtained from roots of the halophyte salt marsh plant H. 

portulacoides collected in the estuary Ria de Aveiro, Portugal, in the area of Laranjo Bay, Murtosa 

(40° 43’ 48.0”N 8° 36’ 45.5” W). Plant roots sterilization and bacterial isolation was performed as 

described previously (Fidalgo et al., 2016). Roots were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 

140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4) for 10 min, 96 % ethanol for 1 min, 5 



120 
 

% sodium hypochlorite for 30 min, 96 % ethanol for 1 min, and finally sterile distilled water for 3 

min (repeated three times). In order to confirm sterility of root surface, aliquots (0.1 mL) of the final 

wash in sterile water were plated on tryptic soy agar (TSA) and incubated at 28 °C for 72 h. Plant 

roots were macerated in PBS and tenfold dilutions of the extracts were made on the same buffer. 

Aliquots of the dilutions (0.1 mL) were plated on TSA. After incubation at 28 °C for 72 h, the obtained 

colonies were transferred to new TSA plates for purification. Strains RZ63T, RZ102 and RZ104 were 

routinely cultured on TSA at 28 °C and preserved at -80 °C on tryptic soy broth (TSB; Merck) 

supplemented with 20 % (v/v) glycerol.  

Genomic DNA was extracted using the Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Thermo Scientific) according 

to the manufacturer’s instructions. Genetic relatedness of the isolates was evaluated by 

enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus ERIC-PCR fingerprinting using primers ERIC1 and 

ERIC2 (Alves et al., 2007). Cluster analysis of ERIC fingerprints was carried out with the software 

GelCompar II (Applied Maths). 

The 16S rRNA gene was amplified using the universal primers 27F and 1492R (Lane, 1991). PCR 

products were purified with the DNA Clean &amp;amp; Concentrator 5 (Zymo Research) and sequenced at 

GATC Biotech (Cologne, Germany). The identification of phylogenetic neighbors was done by 

searching against the EzTaxon database (http://www.ezbiocloud.net/eztaxon; Kim et al., 2012). The 

16S rRNA gene pairwise sequence similarities were determined using the program PHYDIT v3.1 

(Chun, 2001). 

A multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) was performed using the scheme proposed by Richert et al. 

(2007). Thus, in addition to the 16S rRNA gene, the housekeeping genes coding for DNA gyrase 

subunit B (gyrB), RNA-polymerase subunit B (rpoB), recombinase A (recA) and polyphosphate 

kinase (ppk) were amplified and sequenced. A BLAST search of the primers used by Richert et al. 

(2007) against the GenBank database revealed a considerable number of mismatches in some 

primer binding sites of sequences from several species of the genus Microbacterium. Therefore, we 

developed novel sets of primers for the amplification and sequencing of gyrB, rpoB, recA and ppk 

genes in Microbacterium spp. (Table 4.1). For this, full-length sequences of these genes were 

retrieved from completed or draft genomes of Microbacterium maritypicum MF109 (accession 

number ATAO01000228), Microbacterium barkeri 2011-R4 (accession number AKVP01000049), 

Microbacterium oleivorans RIT293 (accession number JFYO01000005), Microbacterium 

paraoxydans DH1b (accession number AYME01000002), Microbacterium laevaniformans OR221

(accession AUGQ01000021) available in GenBank. For each gene, sequences were aligned using 

CLUSTALX v2.1 (Larkin et al., 2007) and primers designed for regions showing high similarity. Primer 

features such as melting temperature (Tm), DNA G+C content (%), self-annealing, GC clamp and 

hairpin formation were checked using the programs available at the Sequence Manipulation Suite 

site (http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/pcr_primer_stats.html). PCR conditions for 

amplification of each gene are listed in Table 4.1.

Nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences and concatenated sequences of gyrB, rpoB, recA and 

ppk and 16S rRNA genes were aligned with sequences from type strains of Microbacterium species 

retrieved from the GenBank database using CLUSTALX v2.1 (Larkin et al., 2007). Phylogenetic 

analyses were performed with MEGA v6.0 (Tamura et al., 2013) using the neighbour-joining (NJ) 

(Saitou &amp;amp; Nei, 1987) and maximum-likelihood (ML) (Felsenstein, 1981) algorithms. Evolutionary 

distances were calculated using the Kimura-2-parameter model. Clavibacter michiganensis DSM 



122 
 

46364T was used as the outgroup taxon. A bootstrap analysis (Hillis &amp;amp; Bull, 1993) based on 1000 

replicates was done to evaluate the robustness of the trees topologies. 

ERIC-PCR fingerprinting showed that strains RZ63T, RZ102 and RZ104 had highly similar ERIC 

fingerprints (Figure 4.1). Nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences (1436 bp) were obtained for 

all strains. 16S rRNA gene pairwise sequence comparisons showed that sequences from strains 

RZ63T, RZ102 and RZ104 shared 100 % similarity.

Microbacterium spp. strains isolated from roots of Halimione portulacoides. Similarity is indicated as a 

percentage. 

 

A search against the EzTaxon database confirmed that all strains belonged to the genus 

Microbacterium. RZ63T and relatives showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to the 

type strain of M. lacus (98.9 %). Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences from all known 

species of the genus showed that these strains formed a distinct sub-clade (in both NJ and ML trees) 

with very high bootstrap support (99–100 %) within a larger clade containing several species of the 

genus Microbacterium (Supplementary Figure S4.1). 

Using the primers developed, we amplified and sequenced the genes gyrB, rpoB, recA and ppk of 

RZ63T, RZ102 and RZ104, as well as of the type strains of M. endophyticum (PA15T), M. hatanonis 

(DSM 19179T), M. lacus (DSM 18910T), M. proteolyticum (RZ36T), M. pumilum (DSM 21018T) and M. 

saccharophilum (NCIMB 14782T) (Supplementary Table S4.1). For M. halimionae PA36T, all primer 

sets worked well except the ones developed for gyrB. Despite the design of several primer sets and 

the testing of different amplification conditions, it was impossible to amplify and sequence the gyrB 

gene. For this reason, M. halimionae PA36T was not included in the MLSA analyses. Phylogenetic 

analyses of concatenated sequences of gyrB, rpoB, recA, ppk and 16S rRNA genes confirmed the 

affiliation of the strains to the genus Microbacterium. RZ63T and its relatives formed a clearly 



123 
 

distinct clade with very high bootstrap support (100 %) (Figure 4.2). Moreover, this MLSA analysis 

confirmed that M. lacus DSM 18910T was the closest phylogenetic relative of the strains studied.

For morphological and physiological characterization, strains were cultured on TSA medium at 28 

°C for 72 h. Growth at different temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 37, 44 °C), NaCl concentrations 

(0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 %, w/v) and pH values (4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 10, 11, 12) was tested using TSA 

as the basal medium. In the case of pH tests, the medium was adjusted using appropriate buffer 

solutions (McIlvaine, 1921; Bates &amp;amp; Bower, 1956). Oxidase and catalase activities were tested as 

described previously (Trujillo et al., 2006). Gram reaction was determined using a Gram Staining kit 

(Merck) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Physiological characteristics of the strains 

were determined using API 20NE, API ZYM and API 50CH test strips (Biomérieux) following the 

manufacturer’s recommendations. Hydrolysis of casein and Tween 20 was evaluated by growing 

the strains on TSA supplemented with 1 % skim milk or Tween 20. After incubation at 28 °C for 72 

h casein hydrolysis was revealed by the formation of a transparent halo around the colonies while 

hydrolysis of Tween 20 resulted in the formation of precipitates around the colonies. On the basis 

of pairwise comparisons of 16S rRNA gene sequences as well as MLSA analyses, Microbacterium 

flavum DSM 18909T and Microbacterium lacus DSM 18910T (Kageyama et al., 2007) were chosen as 

reference strains for comparative phenotypic studies.  

The three endophytic strains produced circular, smooth and yellow-pigmented colonies on TSA 

medium. Cells were Gram-stain-positive, aerobic and short rods. RZ63T and related strains were 

oxidase-positive and catalase activity was variable (strain RZ102 was catalase-negative). None of 

the strains studied reduced nitrate to nitrite and all were negative for indole production. All strains 

(RZ63T and related strains) were able to grow in the presence of NaCl up to 8 % (w/v). Table 4.2 

presents the differential characteristics between RZ63T (and related strains) and the type strains of 

M. lacus (DSM 18910T) and M. flavum (DSM 18909T). 

Bacterial biomass for chemotaxonomic analyses was prepared by cultivating the strains in TSB at 

28 °C for 72 h on a rotary shaker until reaching stationary phase. Cells were harvested by 

centrifugation and washed with 0.9 % (w/v) NaCl. The analyses of peptidoglycan structure were 

performed using TLC, 2D TLC, gas chromatography and GC/MS as described by Schumann (2011). 

Menaquinones were extracted from freeze-dried cells using the two-stage method described by 

Tindall (1990a, b), separated by TLC on silica gels and further analyzed by HPLC. For fatty acid methyl 

ester analysis, all strains were grown on TSA at 28 °C for 3 days or until good growth was obtained 

on the third quadrant (Sasser, 1990). Fatty acids were extracted, methylated and analyzed 

according to the standard protocol of the Sherlock Microbial Identification System (MIDI) and peaks 

were named using the database SACTIN6. Polar lipid and whole-cell hydrolysate sugar analyses 



125 
 

were carried out following the procedures of Minnikin et al. (1984) and Staneck &amp;amp; Roberts (1974) 

using freeze-dried biomass.

Chemotaxonomic analyses showed that peptidoglycan of strain RZ63T contained the amino acids 

alanine, glycine, homoserine (Hse), 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (DAB), glutamic acid and muramic acid 

(Mur) with molar ratios of 0.8 : 1.0 : 1.0 : 0.8 : 1.6 : 0.5. Partial hydrolysate of strain RZ63T contained 

the peptide Gly–Glu. These data suggest that the peptidoglycan of RZ63T belongs to type B2? with 

glycolyl residues (Schumann, 2011). In comparison to M. lacus DSM 18910T that has ornithine (Orn) 

as the diagnostic diaminoacid, RZ63T has DAB as the diagnostic diamino acid. While several other 

members of the family Microbacteriaceae (e.g. members of the genera Agromyces, Agrococcus, 

Clavibacter, Cryobacterium, Leucobacter and Plantibacter) contain DAB as the diagnostic diamino 

acid (Evtushenko &amp;amp; Takeuchi, 2006), the strains of members of the genus Microbacterium described 

so far have either lysine (Lys) or Orn as the diagnostic diaminoacid (Table 4.3). This is quite a 

distinguishing feature of RZ63T. Peptidoglycan analysis was repeated and the results were 

confirmed. Whole-cell sugar analyses revealed the presence of ribose, galactose, glucose and 

mannose.  



127 
 

Regarding menaquinones, RZ63T contained MK-10 (2 %), MK-11 (29 %), MK-12 (61 %) and MK-13 (6 

%) and this composition is in accordance with that reported for members of the genus 

Microbacterium. The major fatty acids (&gt;10 %) of RZ63T were anteiso-C15:0 (69.1 %) and iso-C15:0 

(19.3 %) (Table 4.4). Quantitative differences of iso-C15:0 and anteiso-C17:0 were found between 

RZ63T and the remaining strains compared. Nevertheless, the tests were run again and the results 

were confirmed. With respect to the polar lipid profile of the novel strain (Supplementary Figure 

S4.2) the following lipids were detected: diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, one 

unidentified glycolipid, two unidentified phospholipids, four unidentified aminolipids and one 

unidentified lipid. These results are in agreement with the polar lipid profile reported for other 

species of the genus Microbacterium. 

The DNA base composition of RZ63T was determined by HPLC (Mesbah et al., 1989). DNA was 

isolated by the modified procedure described by Gevers et al. (2001) and hybridizations were 

carried out at 53 °C in the presence of 50 % formamide using the modified microplate method (Ezaki 

et al., 1989; Goris et al., 1998; Cleenwerck et al., 2002). RZ63T was hybridized against the species 

with the highest 16S rRNA gene similarity, namely M. lacus DSM 18910T. 

The DNA G+C content of RZ63T was 68.9 mol%. The value is within the range of 61–75 % reported 

for species of the genus Microbacterium (Suzuki &amp;amp; Hamada, 2012; Alves et al., 2014). DNA–DNA 

hybridization was used to clarify the relatedness of the strains and their closest relatives. DNA– 

DNA relatedness between RZ63T and M. lacus DSM 18910T was 14±1 %. Therefore, RZ63T represents 

a novel genomic species (Wayne et al., 1987). 

 

On the basis of the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic results described RZ63T (and 

related strains) are clearly distinct from their closest phylogenetic relative M. lacus DSM 18910T and 

represent a novel species in the genus Microbacterium, for which the name Microbacterium 

diaminobutyricum sp. nov. is proposed.

Emended description of the genus Microbacterium Orla-Jensen 1919 Takeuchi and 

Hatano 1998 

The emended description of the genus is based on that given by Takeuchi &amp;amp; Hatano (1998) with the 

following modification: the peptidoglycan contains either lysine, ornithine or diaminobutyric acid 

as the diagnostic diamino acid. 

 

Description of Microbacterium diaminobutyricum sp. nov. 

Microbacterium diaminobutyricum (di.a.mi.no.bu.ty’ri.cum. N.L. n. acidum diaminobutyricum, 

containing 2,4-diaminobutyric acid in the peptidoglycan; N.L. neut. adj. diaminobutyricum, 

pertaining to diaminobutyric acid). 

Cells are Gram-stain-positive, aerobic short rods. Colonies on TSA are circular, smooth and yellowish 

after 3 days incubation at 28 °C. The growth temperature range is 10–37 °C, with an optimum at 28 

°C. Growth occurs at pH 6.5–11 with an optimum at pH 7.0, and in the presence of 0.5–8 % (w/v) 

NaCl with an optimum of 2 % (w/v). Cells are positive for oxidase activity. Catalase, urease, 

hydrolysis of aesculin and gelatin are variable. Nitrate reduction to nitrite, indole production and 

hydrolysis of casein and Tween 20 are not observed. The following substrates are used as sole 

carbon sources (API 50CH and API 20NE): glycerol, L-arabinose, D-xylose, D-galactose, D-glucose, D-



130 
 

fructose, D-mannose, L-rhamnose, D-mannitol, amygdalin, arbutin, aesculin ferric citrate, salicin, 

D-cellobiose, D-maltose, D-lactose, D-saccharose, D-trehalose and D-turanose; the utilization of 

erythritol, D-arabinose, D-ribose, L-sorbose, methyl-?-D-glucopyranoside, N-acetylglucosamine, 

gentiobiose, potassium gluconate and phenylacetic acid is variable; L-xylose, D-adonitol, methyl-?-

D-xylopyranoside, dulcitol, inositol, D-sorbitol, methyl-?-D-mannopyranoside, D-melibiose, inulin, 

D-melezitose, D-raffinose, starch, glycogen, xylitol, D-tagatose, D-lyxose. D-fucose, L-fucose, D-

arabitol, L-arabitol, potassium 2-ketogluconate, potassium 5-ketogluconate, capric acid, adipic acid, 

malic acid and trisodium citrate are not used. In the API ZYM tests, cells are positive for esterase 

lipase (C8), lipase (C14), ?-chymotrypsin, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, naphthol-AS-BI-

phosphohydrolase, ?-galactosidase, ?-glucuronidase, ?-glucosidase, ?-glucosidase and N-acetyl-

bglucosaminidase; results are variable for esterase (C4), leucine arylamidase, valine arylamidase, 

cystine arylamidase, trypsin, ?-galactosidase and ?-mannosidase; and cells are negative for arginine 

dihydrolase and ?-fucosidase. The cell-wall peptidoglycan type is B2? with glycolyl residues and 

contains 2,4-diaminobutyric acid as diamino acid. The cell-wall sugars are ribose, mannose, glucose 

and galactose. The major menaquinones are MK-11 and MK-12. The major cellular fatty acids are 

anteiso-C15:0 and iso-C15:0 or anteiso-C15:0, anteiso-C17:0 and iso-C16:0. The lipids comprise 

diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, one unidentified glycolipid, two unidentified 

phospholipids, four unidentified aminolipids and one unidentified lipid. 

The type strain is RZ63T (=DSM 27101T =CECT 8355T), isolated from roots of Halimione portulacoides 

(sea purslane) collected in Ria de Aveiro, Laranjo Bay, Murtosa, Portugal (40° 43’ 48.0” N 8° 36’ 

45.5” W). The G+C content of the genomic DNA of the type strain is 68.9 mol%.

Abstract 

A Gram-stain negative, oxidase- and catalase-positive, motile, aerobic, non-pigmented spirillum, 

designated CPA1T, was isolated from the surface-sterilized tissues of a halophyte, Halimione 

portulacoides, collected from a salt marsh in Aveiro, Portugal. The isolate was mesophilic, 

facultatively alkaliphilic and halophilic, and grew between 18 and 42.5 °C (optimum 30 °C), from pH 

5.0 to 11.5 (optimum 7.0-7.5), from 0.5 to 5 % NaCl (w/v, optimum 2 %). Analysis of the 16S rRNA 

gene sequence showed that this strain belongs to the genus Saccharospirillum, as the highest 

sequence similarities were observed with Saccharospirillum impatiens EL-105T (96.46 %), 

Saccharospirillum salsuginis YIM-Y25T (96.32 %) and Saccharospirillum aestuarii IMCC 4453T (95.17 

%). The next closest matches were with other genera and below 95.0 %. Phylogenetic analyses 

revealed that the strain forms a robust clade with other species of the genus Saccharospirillum. The 

main respiratory quinone was Q-8 and the major fatty acids were C16:0 and summed feature 8 (C18:1 

?7c and/or C18:1 ?6c). The DNA G+C content was 55.2 mol%. Molecular, physiological and 

biochemical differences between strain CPA1T and other type strains of species of the genus 

Saccharospirillum support the addition of this novel species to the genus, and the name 

Saccharospirillum correiae sp. nov. is proposed, with CPA1T (= CECT 9131T = LMG 29516T) as the 

type strain.

Main text 

The genus Saccharospirillum, established by Labrenz et al. (2003), belongs to the family 

Saccharospirillaceae and, at the time of writing, it comprises three species with validly published 

names, all of which have been isolated from saline environments: Saccharospirillum impatiens from 

a hypersaline lake (Labrenz et al., 2003), Saccharospirillum salsuginis from subterranean brine 

(Chen et al., 2009), and Saccharospirillum aestuarii from mudflats (Choi et al., 2011). The genus has 

been described as Gram-negative spirilla, non-spore forming, containing poly-?-hydroxybutyrate, 

which may form coccoid bodies in older cultures, and positive for peroxidase, catalase and 

cytochrome oxidase activities, with Q-8 as the prevalent respiratory quinone, and C16:1 ?7c, C16:0 

and C18:1 ?7c as the predominant fatty acids (Labrenz et al., 2003). This genus has also been 

described as comprising obligate aerobes, microaerophiles or facultative anaerobes. The motility 

and presence of flagella has been determined to be species-dependent (Choi et al., 2011).  

 

In a study of the bacterial diversity associated with the internal tissues of the halophyte Halimione 

portulacoides, 665 isolates were obtained and characterized (Fidalgo et al., 2016). Briefly, healthy 

specimens of the halophyte were collected in Ria de Aveiro, Portugal, and above- and belowground 

tissues were separated and surface sterilized. Dilutions of macerated tissues were plated in Tryptic 

Soy Agar (TSA, Merck, Germany), R2A (Merck, Germany) and Marine Agar (MA, Difco Laboratories, 

France). The present study focuses on strain CPA1T, an isolate obtained from surface sterilized 

aboveground tissues of H. portulacoides. Strain CPA1T was routinely streaked on MA medium and 

incubated under aerobic conditions at 28 °C.  

 

Genomic DNA of the strain was extracted using a Genomic DNA Purification kit #0513 (Thermo 

Scientific, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR 

with universal primers 27F and 1492R, as described elsewhere (Fidalgo et al., 2016), and sequenced 

with primers 27F (Lane, 1991) and 704F (Kaksonen et al., 2006). Analysis of similarity using a near 

full length 16S rRNA gene sequence (1418 nt) also gave evidence that strain CPA1T belongs to the 

genus Saccharospirillum, as highest similarities were seen with this genus: S. impatiens EL-105T 

(96.46 %), S. salsuginis YIM-Y25T (96.32 %) and S. aestuarii IMCC 4453T (95.17 %). The next closest 

matches occurred with type strains of the genus Reinekea, with less than 95.0 % 16S rRNA gene 

sequence similarities. Similarities with type strains belonging to other genera were below 92.0 %.

For phylogenetic analyses, the sequences of closely related taxa were obtained from the EzTaxon 

database (Kim et al., 2012). Sequence alignments were carried out with Clustal Omega (McWilliam 

et al., 2013), and BioEdit version 7.2.5 (Hall, 1999) was used to edit the aligned sequences. 

Phylogenetic analyses were performed using MEGA version 6.0 (Tamura et al., 2013) by using 

Kimura’s two-parameter model (Kimura, 1980) in the reconstruction of neighbour-joining (NJ, 

Saitou &amp;amp; Nei, 1987), maximum-likelihood (ML, Felsenstein, 1981) and maximum parsimony (MP, 

Fitch, 1971) trees. Bootstrap values based on 1000 replications were obtained in these phylogenetic 

analyses. The topology of the ML tree was the same as the MP tree. Figure 4.3 shows that strain 

CPA1T forms a robust clade with the three species of the genus Saccharospirillum with validly 

published names. High bootstrap values were observed, ranging from 72 to 96 %, depending on the 

tree building method, confirming CPA1T as a potential novel member of this genus.

of other related taxa, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Filled circles indicate nodes that were also 

recovered in the maximum-parsimony (MP) tree and the maximum-likelihood (ML) tree, based on the same 

sequences. Bootstrap values (expressed as percentages of 1000 replications) ? 50 % are shown at branching 

points for NJ/ML/MP trees. Amphritea atlantica M41T was used as an outgroup. Accession numbers for the 

type strains are shown in parenthesis. Bar, 0.01 nt substitution rate (Knuc) units. 

 

Optimal growth conditions for strain CPA1T were determined using MA medium. The temperature 

range for growth and the optimum were tested by incubating at 4, 18, 26, 30, 37, 42.5 and 50 °C. 

At the optimum growth temperature, the pH range and optimum were assayed using pH values 

from 4 to 12, at intervals of 0.5. At the optimum growth temperature and pH, the strain’s growth 



142 
 

requirements for, and tolerance to salt (NaCl) was assessed using the following NaCl 

concentrations: 0.5 (TSA without additional NaCl), 2 (MA without additional NaCl), 3 [MA 

supplemented with 1 % NaCl (w/v)], 5, 10, 12, 15 and 20 % NaCl (w/v).  

 

Growth in biochemical and phenotypic tests was determined on MA, and incubation was conducted 

at 30 °C for 48 h, unless otherwise stated. A Gram staining kit (Merck, Germany) was used according 

to the manufacturer’s instructions. Determination of cell size, as well as morphology and motility 

was carried out using light microscopy (Nikon 80i). The hanging-drop method (Bowman, 2000) was 

used to assess gliding motility, after growing the strain in half strength MA for 72 h, and using cavity 

slides. Catalase and oxidase activities were determined using H2O2-reagent (Liofilchem, Italy) and 

oxidase strips (Liofilchem, Italy), respectively. Growth in thioglycollate medium (Merck, Germany) 

was used to assess oxygen metabolism, and incubation was followed for 7 days. Production of H2S 

was assessed using Kligler’s Iron Agar (Merck, Germany). Ability to hydrolyse starch, casein, 

cellulose and xylan was assessed by methods described in Fidalgo et al. (2016).  

 

Biochemical tests were carried out using API 20NE, API ZYM and API 50CH strips (bioMérieux, 

France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, except for using 0.9 % (w/v) NaCl solution for 

preparing cell suspensions. Saccharospirillum impatiens DSM 12546T was tested under the same 

conditions for comparison. These results are given in the species description and Table 4.5. Some 

results of the API 50CH tests of S. impatiens DSM 12546T differed from the original description by 

Labrenz et al. (2003). The differences observed may result from the use of different suspension 

medium and different incubation temperatures. 

Determination of G+C content was performed by HPLC (Mesbah et al., 1989). The result obtained 

for strain CPA1T was 55.2 %, which is close to the values determined for other species of the genus 

Saccharospirillum, which are 54.5 to 54.8 mol% for S. impatiens EL-105T (Labrenz et al., 2003), 58.5 

mol% for S. salsuginis YIM-Y25T (Chen et al., 2009), and 56.5 mol% for S. aestuarii IMCC 4453T (Choi 

et al., 2011).

Assessment of fatty acid profiles, polar lipids and quinones was conducted as described by Proença 

et al. (2014) and performed in parallel with similar assessments of S. impatiens DSM 12546T. To 

obtain cells for fatty acid profile determination, growth was obtained on MA at 30 °C for 48 h. The 

main fatty acids observed for strain CPA1T were C16:0 and summed feature 8 (C18:1 ?7c and/or C18:1 

?6c), which add up to over 78 % of the total (complete profile in Table 4.6). Summed features arise 

when the equivalent chain length value obtained corresponds to a fatty acid that cannot be 

separated from another fatty acid. Consequently, the relative concentration of the possible two or 

more fatty acids is given as a singular value (da Costa et al., 2011). The results are in accordance 

with what has previously been described for the genus. Growth for determination of quinones and 

polar lipids was obtained using Marine Broth (MB) and incubating at 30 °C for 72 h. The main 

quinone detected was Q-8, which is in accordance with data for the genus. Q-9 was also detected, 

but in minor amounts. The polar lipid profiles obtained for strain CPA1T and S. impatiens DSM 

12546T were very similar, suggesting that both strains belong to the same genus (Supplementary 

Figure S4.3). The lipids phosphatidylethanolamine, monomethylphosphatidylethanolamine and 

phosphatidylcholine were identified in the profile of strain CPA1T, but diphosphatidylglycerol and 

phosphatidylglycerol were not detected.

The physiological and biochemical test results for strain CPA1T are given in the species description. 

The phylogenetic and 16S rRNA gene sequencing data, as well as the similarities in biochemical and 



146 
 

physiological characteristics, indicate that strain CPA1T belongs to the genus Saccharospirillum. This 

novel strain is distinguishable from other species in the genus with validly published names, and 

these differentiating characteristics are listed in Table 4.5. As the threshold for genomic delineation 

of a novel species (97 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity; Stackebrandt &amp;amp; Goebel, 1994; Wayne 

et al., 1987) was not surpassed, there was no need for DNA-DNA relatedness tests. So, CPA1T is 

suggested to represent a novel species of the genus Saccharospirillum, and the name 

Saccharospirillum correiae sp. nov. is proposed.

Abstract 

Two Gram-negative, rod-shaped, motile bacterial strains, named CPA5T and BR75T were isolated 

from the halophyte Halimione portulacoides. Both presented optimum growth at 30 °C, pH 7.0–7.5 

and 1–2 % NaCl (w/v) for strain CPA5T, and pH 7.5–8.0 and 2 % NaCl (w/v) for strain BR75T. 

Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences affiliated both strains to the genus 

Altererythrobacter. CPA5T presented highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with 

Altererythrobacter aestuarii KYW147T (96.5 %), followed by Altererythrobacter namhicola KYW48T 

(95.9 %), Novosphingobium indicum H25T (95.6 %), and Altererythrobacter oceanensis Y2T (95.5 %). 

BR75T displayed highest similarity with Altererythrobacter marensis MSW-14T (96.5 %), followed by 

Altererythrobacter xinjiangensis S3-63T, Altererythrobacter luteolus SW-109T and 

Altererythrobacter indicus MSSRF26T (96.1 %). Neither strain contained Bacteriochlorophyll a. The 

main fatty acids observed for CPA5T were C17:1 ?6c and summed features 3 (C16:1 ?7c and/or iso-

C15:0 2-OH) and 8 (C18:1 ?7c and/or C18:1 ?6c). The latter summed feature was the dominant fatty 

acid observed for strain BR75T as well. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, 

unidentified phospholipids and unidentified glycolipids for both strains. The predominant 

ubiquinone was Q-10 for both strains, and the DNA G+C content was 63.4 mol% and 58.3 mol% for 

CPA5T and BR75T, respectively. Based on phenotypic and genotypic results, both strains represent 

novel species belonging to the genus Altererythrobacter for which the names Altererythrobacter 

halimionae sp. nov. (type strain CPA5T = CECT 9130T?=?LMG 29519T) and Altererythrobacter 

endophyticus sp. nov (type strain BR75T = CECT 9129T?=?LMG 29518T) are proposed.

Main text 

The genus Altererythrobacter was described in 2007 (Kwon et al., 2007), emended in 2012 (Xue et 

al., 2012), and 2016 (Xue et al., 2016), and belongs to the family Erythrobacteraceae (Lee et al., 

2005). At the time of writing the genus contains 22 validly published species, several of which 

frequently isolated from marine and estuarine environments (e.g. Lai et al., 2009; Seo &amp;amp; Lee, 2010; 

Park et al., 2011; Park et al., 2016). Its occurrence in association with plants is rare and there is only 

one species that has been isolated from the rhizosphere of wild rice (Kumar et al., 2008). 

The genus Altererythrobacter comprises Gram-negative bacteria that do not produce H2S. Cells 

cannot grow in anaerobic conditions and nitrate is not reduced. Cell suspensions and colonies are 

yellow, and the methanol-soluble pigment indicates absence of Bacteriochlorophyll a (BChl a). The 

main quinone is Q-10 (Kwon et al., 2007) and the major polar lipids are phosphatidylethanolamine, 

phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and sphingoglycolipid (Xue et al., 2012). The DNA G+C 

content range is 54.5–67.5 mol%, and catalase reaction can be positive or negative (Xue et al., 2016). 

The major fatty acids include C18:1 ?7c (Kwon et al., 2007), C16:1 ?7c and C17:1 ?6c. 

The diversity of the endophytic community of the halophyte Halimione portulacoides was assessed 

in a salt marsh in Aveiro, Portugal. Briefly, healthy specimens of the halophyte were collected, 

aboveground and belowground tissues from these specimens were separated, surface-sterilized, 

macerated in phosphate buffer solution and studied for their bacterial diversity (Fidalgo et al., 

2016). This study focuses on two strains obtained in those isolation efforts: strain CPA5T, isolated 

from the aboveground tissues; and BR75T, isolated from the belowground tissues of the halophyte. 

Strains CPA5T and BR75T were originally isolated from and routinely cultured on Marine Agar (MA, 

Difco Laboratories, France) culture medium, at 28 °C, under aerobic conditions.  

Genomic DNA was extracted, subjected to PCR amplification for 16S rRNA gene, and sequenced as 

described elsewhere (Fidalgo et al., 2016). The primers 27F (Lane, 1991) and 704F (Kaksonen et al., 

2006) were used for sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. The nearly full length sequences obtained for 

CPA5T (1412 nt) and BR75T (1406 nt) were used for similarity analyses using the Identify tool present 

in the EzTaxon platform (Kim et al., 2012). For strain CPA5T, the closest matches were observed 

with type strains Altererythrobacter aestuarii KYW147T (96.5 % similarity of the 16S rRNA gene 

sequence), followed by Altererythrobacter namhicola KYW48T (95.9 %), Novosphingobium indicum 

H25T (95.6 %), and Altererythrobacter oceanensis Y2T (95.5 %). For strain BR75T, the most closely 

related type strains were Altererythrobacter marensis MSW-14T (96.5 %), followed by 

Altererythrobacter xinjiangensis S3-63T and Altererythrobacter luteolus SW-109T (96.1 %) and 



154 
 

Altererythrobacter indicus MSSRF26T (96.1 %). 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity percentages to 

other type strains were below 95.5 % and 96.0 % for CPA5T and BR75T, respectively.  

The 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains CPA5T and BR75T were aligned with sequences of related 

type strains, retrieved from the EzTaxon database (Kim et al., 2012). The sequences were then 

aligned using Clustal Omega (McWilliam et al., 2013) and edited using BioEdit version 7.2.5 (Hall, 

1999). MEGA version 6.0 (Tamura et al., 2013) was used to cluster the sequences applying different 

methods: neighbour-joining (NJ, Saitou &amp;amp; Nei, 1987) and maximum-likelihood (ML, Felsenstein, 

1981). The Kimura two-parameter model (Kimura, 1980) was used in clustering, and bootstrap 

values based on 1000 replications were obtained in these phylogenetic analyses. The obtained 

phylogenetic trees clearly placed both strains in independent clusters in the genus 

Altererythrobacter (Figure 4.4). A more extended overview of the placement of strains CPA5T and 

BR75T in the context of the family Erythrobacteraceae is represented in Supplementary Figure S4.4.  

The optimal conditions for growth were tested using a base of MA medium. The range and optimum 

conditions were tested for temperature first, then pH and finally for NaCl concentration. Tests were 

performed by incubating strains at 4, 18, 26, 30, 37, 42.5 and 50 °C, pH from 4 to 12 in 0.5 intervals, 

and NaCl tolerance was tested using concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 % NaCl (w/v) 

in a medium composed of 5 g L-1 yeast extract (Alfa Aesar, Massachusetts, USA) and 10 g L-1 tryptone 

casein peptone (Amresco, Texas, USA). Optimum temperature for growth was observed at 30 °C for 

both strains. Optimum growth for CPA5T was observed at pH 7-7.5 and 1–2 % NaCl (w/v), and for 

strain BR75T at pH 7.5-8 and 2 % NaCl (w/v). 

Biochemical and phenotypic tests were performed with cells grown on MA medium for 48 h, at 30 

°C. Gram staining reaction was performed with a kit, and manufacturer’s instructions (Merck, 

Germany) were followed. Catalase and oxidase activities were assessed using the H2O2-reagent and 

oxidase strips, respectively (both from Liofilchem, Italy). Light microscopy was used for 

determination of cell size, morphology and motility. Additionally, cells grown in half-strength MA 

for 72 h were placed on cavity slides and gliding motility was assessed by hang-drop method 

(Bowman, 2000). Oxygen metabolism was assessed by observing growth on thioglycollate medium 

(Merck, Germany) for 7 days. The ability to produce H2S was assessed using Kligler’s Iron Agar 

(Merck, Germany). Ability to hydrolyse starch, Tween 20, xylan, casein and cellulose, and to produce 

indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) were assessed as described in Fidalgo et al. (2016).

To assess presence of Bacteriochlorophyll a and absorbance peaks of the pigments, cells were 

grown on Marine Broth (MB), washed once with distilled water, vigorously ressuspended in 90 % 

(v/v) acetone and centrifuged. The supernatant was then removed and kept at 4 °C in the dark 

overnight. Absorption peaks were assessed from 300 to 800 nm using the Thermo Spectroscopy 

Genesys 6.

Additional biochemical tests were performed for strains CPA5T, BR75T as well as type strains 

Altererythrobacter marensis KCTC 22370T and Altererythrobacter aestuarii KCTC 22735T, using API 

20NE, API ZYM and API 50CH strips (bioMérieux, France) following the manufacturer’s instructions, 

except for using 0.9 % (w/v) NaCl to prepare inocula. The results for biochemical and phenotypic 

tests are detailed in the description of the new species, and differentiating characteristics are stated 

in Table 4.7.  

 

The assessment of respiratory quinones, polar lipids and profile for fatty acids was conducted as 

described in Proença et al. (2014) and performed with strains CPA5T, Altererythrobacter aestuarii 

KCTC 22735T, BR75T and Altererythrobacter marensis KCTC 22370T simultaneously. Cells were 

grown in MB at 30 °C for 48 h to obtain biomass for quinone and polar lipids assays. The main 

quinone detected for all strains was Q-10, and Q-9 and Q-8 were detected in minor amounts. The 

main fatty acids observed for CPA5T were C17:1 ?6c (13.8 %) and summed features 3 (C16:1 ?7c 

and/or iso-C15:0 2-OH; 21.4 %) and 8 (C18:1 ?7c and/or C18:1 ?6c; 32.6 %), comprising over 67 % of 

total fatty acids. For strain BR75T the main fatty acids were comprised in summed feature 8, 

representing 76.3 % of total fatty acids. The results are in accordance to what is observed in other 

Altererythrobacter species, seen as the characteristic fatty acid of the genus (C18:1 ?7c) is present 

in summed feature 8 of our analysis. The complete fatty acid composition for all tested strains is 

presented in Table 4.8. The polar lipid profiles obtained are depicted in Supplementary Figure S4.5. 

For strain CPA5T the polar lipids detected in major amounts included phosphatidylethanolamine 

(PE), an unidentified glycolipid (GL2) and three unidentified phospholipids (PL2, PL3 and PL5). The 

profile for the phylogenetically close relative A. aestuarii KCTC 22735T was similar to that obtained 

for strain CPA5T, albeit presenting small differences in regards to the minor polar lipids. For strain 

BR75T, the major polar lipids were PE, an unidentified glycolipid (GL2) and four unidentified 

phospholipids (PL2, PL3, PL4 and PL5). The profile was highly similar to that of A. marensis KCTC 

22370T and only discrepancies in polar lipids in minor amounts were observed. These results further 

indicate that strains CPA5T and BR75T belong to the genus Altererythrobacter but present slight 

differences with the most closely related strains. Determination of G+C content was performed by 

HPLC (Mesbah et al., 1989). The results obtained (63.4 mol% for CPA5T and 58.3 mol% BR75T) are 

in agreement with what has been previously observed in the genus (54.5 to 67.5 mol%; Xue et al., 

2016).

Detailed results for each strain are given in the respective species description section. Considering 

the phylogenetic and 16S rRNA gene sequencing data, similarities in physiological and biochemical 

traits, it is clear that CPA5T and BR75T belong to the genus Altererythrobacter. Given that the 16S 

rRNA sequence similarities did not surpass the threshold for genomic delimitation of a new species 

(97 % sequence similarity; Stackebrandt &amp;amp; Goebel, 1994; Wayne et al., 1987), there was no need to 

perform DNA-DNA relatedness tests. Strains CPA5T and BR75T are, nevertheless, distinguishable 

from validly published species of the genus, as they present differences in certain traits (Table 4.7). 

Differences between the novel species BR75T and the closely related reference strain of A. marensis 

include the ability to hydrolyse casein, to assimilate malic acid, to produce acid from salicin, and 



159 
 

activity of ?-galactosidase, ?-glucosidase and ?-glucuronidase. Between CPA5T and A. aestuarii 

differences include motility and activity of lipase, acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase. Accordingly, 

strains CPA5T and BR75T represent novel species of the genus Altererythrobacter, for which the 

names Altererythrobacter halimionae sp. nov. and Altererythrobacter endophyticus sp. nov, 

respectively, are proposed.

Abstract 

Taxonomical analyses were performed on strain CPA58T, an isolate obtained from surface-sterilized 

aboveground tissues of the halophyte Halimione portulacoides, collected from a salt marsh in Ria 

de Aveiro, Portugal. The strain was Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, oxidase-negative and 

catalase-positive. Optimal growth was observed at 26 °C, at pH 6–8 and in the presence of 2 to 3?% 

(w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain CPA58T 

belonged to the genus Zunongwangia, with highest sequence similarity to both Zunongwangia 

profunda SM-A87T and Zunongwangia mangrovi P2E16T (96.5 %), followed by Zunongwangia 

atlantica 22II14-10F7T (95.9 %). The principal fatty acids were iso-C15:0, summed feature 3 (C16?:1 ?7c 

and/or iso-C15:0 2-OH) and iso-C17:0 3-OH. The major respiratory quinone was MK-6 and the DNA 

G+C content was 35.1 mol%. Phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic analyses clearly placed strain 

CPA58T in the genus Zunongwangia. Nevertheless, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis evidenced that 

the threshold for same species relatedness was not surpassed, and biochemical tests revealed 

diagnostic characteristics that differentiate this strain from other type strains in the genus. Overall, 

the analyses performed showed that strain CPA58T represents a novel species within the genus 

Zunongwangia, for which the name Zunongwangia endophytica sp. nov. is proposed, with the type 

strain CPA58T (?=?CECT 9128T?=?LMG 29517T).

Main text 

The genus Zunongwangia was proposed by Qin et al. (2007) and belongs to the family 

Flavobacteriaceae. At the time of writing, the genus included three species, isolated from different 

environments: Zunongwangia profunda from deep-sea sediment (Qin et al., 2007), Zunongwangia 

atlantica from rhizosphere of a mangrove tree (Shao et al., 2014) and Zunongwangia mangrovi 

from deep-sea water (Rameshkumar et al., 2014). The genus is described as comprising Gram-

negative, non-motile and non-spore forming, strictly aerobic rods, catalase- and oxidase-positive, 

without flexirubin, with MK-6 as the main menaquinone, and with the following main fatty acids: 

iso-C15:0, summed feature 3 (iso-C15:0 2-OH and/or C16:1 ?7c), iso-C17:0 3-OH, iso-C15:1 G, iso-C17:1 ?9c, 

C15:0, iso-C15:0 3-OH (Qin et al., 2007). An emendation to the description of the genus added that 

some species require sodium ions for growth (Rameshkumar et al., 2014). 

In the scope of a diversity study of endophytic bacteria of the halophyte Halimione portulacoides 

from a salt marsh in Ria de Aveiro, Portugal, 665 isolates were obtained and characterized (Fidalgo 

et al., 2016). The present study focuses on one of these isolates, designated strain CPA58T, isolated 

from aboveground tissues of H. portulacoides. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses 

showed that strain CPA58T was closely related to the genus Zunongwangia. The aim of this study 

was to determine the exact taxonomic position of strain CPA58T using a polyphasic approach, as 

suggested by the minimal standards for describing new taxa in the family Flavobacteriaceae 

(Bernardet et al., 2002). 

Healthy specimens of the halophyte Halimione portulacoides were collected from a salt marsh in 

September of 2012. Aboveground and belowground tissues from these specimens were surface-

sterilized, macerated in phosphate buffer solution and studied for their bacterial diversity. The 

bacterial isolation was performed on three culture media: Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA, Merck, Germany), 

Marine Agar (MA, Difco Laboratories, France) and R2A (Merck, Germany) (Fidalgo et al., 2016). 

Strain CPA58T was originally isolated from and routinely cultured on MA culture medium, at 28 °C, 

under aerobic conditions. 

 

Genomic DNA was prepared using the Genomic DNA Purification kit #0513 (Thermo Scientific, USA) 

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was performed 

as described elsewhere (Fidalgo et al., 2016) and sequencing was done with the universal primers 

27F (Lane, 1991) and 704F (Kaksonen et al., 2006). Sequences of related taxa were obtained from 



169 
 

the EzTaxon database (Yoon et al., 2016). Sequence alignment was performed with Clustal Omega 

(McWilliam et al., 2013), and edited with BioEdit version 7.2.5 (Hall, 1999). Phylogenetic analyses 

were performed using MEGA version 6.0 (Tamura et al., 2013). The Kimura two-parameter model 

(Kimura, 1980) was used in clustering with the neighbour-joining (NJ, Saitou &amp;amp; Nei, 1987) and 

maximum-likelihood (ML, Felsenstein, 1981). Bootstrap values based on 1000 replications were 

obtained in these phylogenetic analyses.  

The near full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain CPA58T was obtained (1429 nt). The 16S 

rRNA gene sequence similarity was highest (96.5 %) with Zunongwangia profunda SM-A87T and 

Zunongwangia mangrovi P2E16T, followed by 95.9 % with Zunongwangia atlantica 22II14-10F7T 

and 95.03 % with Salegentibacter chungangensis CAU 1289T, while the similarities to other type 

strains were all below 94.0 %. These results support that strain CPA58T belongs to the genus 

Zunongwangia. A phylogenetic tree was built, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences of strain CPA58T 

and related type strains. As presented in Figure 4.6, CPA58T forms a clear monophyletic cluster with 

other Zunongwangia type strains, with high bootstrap support (99 ?%).  

 

Optimal growth conditions were assessed in MA medium. Ability to grow at different temperatures 

was tested by incubating at 4, 18, 26, 30, 37, 42.5 and 50 °C. At optimal growth temperature, the 

pH range for growth was tested from pH 4 to 12 in 1 unit intervals. The following buffers were used 

to adjust the pH values: MES (4-Morpholineethanesulfonic acid, pH 4 to 6; Sigma, USA), Tricine (pH 

7 and 8; Sigma, USA), and CAPS (N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid, pH 9 to 12; Sigma, 

USA). At optimal growth temperature and pH, tolerance to NaCl was tested using MA at ¼ strength 

as the basal medium, to test NaCl concentrations of 0.5, 1 [adding 0.5 % NaCl (w/v)], 2, 3, 5, 10, 15 

and 20 % (w/v). 

Unless otherwise stated, cells were grown on MA supplemented with 1 % (w/v) NaCl, incubated at 

26 °C for 2 days. Gram staining was performed using a Gram staining set (Merck, Germany) 

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell morphology and motility were observed using 

light microscopy (Nikon 80i). Gliding motility was assessed after growing the strain in half strength 

MA for 72h, using cavity slides and following the hang-drop method described in Bowman (2000). 

The presence of flexirubin-type pigments was assessed as described by Bowman (2000). Catalase 

activity was determined using the H2O2-reagent (Liofilchem, Italy). Oxidase activity was evaluated 

using oxidase strips (Liofilchem, Italy).

representatives of other related taxa based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Filled circles indicate nodes that 

were also recovered in maximum-likelihood (ML) tree, based on the same sequences. Bootstrap values 

(expressed as percentages of 1000 replications) ? 50 % are shown at branch points for NJ/ML trees. Zobellia 

galactanivorans DsiJT was used as an outgroup. Accession numbers for the type strains are shown in 

parenthesis. Bar, 0.01 nt substitution rate (Knuc) units. 

 

Anaerobic growth was assessed using thioglycollate medium (Merck, Germany) supplemented with 

2 % NaCl, and growth was monitored for 7 days. DNA hydrolysis was determined on DNase agar 

(HiMedia, India) with 0.1 % toluidine blue, and supplemented with 2 % NaCl. Citrate utilization was 

assessed using Simmon’s Citrate Agar (Oxoid, USA) supplemented with 2 % NaCl. Production of H2S 

was evaluated using Kligler’s Iron Agar (Merck, Germany) supplemented with 2 % NaCl. Hydrolysis 



171 
 

of casein, starch, tween 20, cellulose and xylan, phosphate solubilization, siderophore production, 

1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase activity and indole acetic acid (IAA) 

production were assessed as described by Fidalgo et al. (2016).  

Strain CPA58T was Gram-stain-negative, oxidase-negative, catalase-positive, non-pigmented, rod-

shaped and non-motile. Growth in thioglycollate medium showed a microaerophilic behavior. 

Other physiological characteristics of strain CPA58T are stated in the species description section. 

 

Biochemical tests were carried out using API 20NE, API ZYM and API 50CH strips (bioMérieux, 

France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, except for using 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution for 

preparing cell suspension. For strain CPA58T cell suspension was prepared using a 4 % (w/v) sea 

salts (Sigma, USA) solution in order to accommodate the salinity requirements of this strain. 

Zunongwangia profunda DSM 18752T and Z. mangrovi DSM 24499T were tested for comparison. 

These results are given in the species description and Table 4.9. 

Determination of G+C content was performed by HPLC (Mesbah et al., 1989). The DNA G+C content 

of the endophytic isolate CPA58T was 35.1 mol%. The value is similar to that of Z. profunda SM-A87T 

(36.2 %) and Z. mangrovi P2E16T (34.3 %) that were obtained from genome data (Qin et al., 2010; 

Rameshkumar et al., 2014). 

For lipoquinone analysis, strain CPA58T was grown on marine broth (MB) at 26 °C for 72 h, and the 

cells were then harvested and lyophilized. Lipoquinones were then extracted and analyzed as 

described by Proença et al. (2014). The major respiratory quinone of strain CPA58T was determined 

to be MK-6, which is in accordance with the characteristics of the genus Zunongwangia.  

For fatty acid analysis, cells were grown on MA at 26 °C for 48h, and the analysis was conducted as 

described by Proença et al. (2014). The Agilent Technologies 6890N Network GC System and 

Standard MIS Library Generation Software (SherlockMicrobial ID System, TSBA 6 database, version 

6.0; USA) were used. The fatty acids profile of CPA58T was produced in parallel with those of Z. 

profunda DSM 18752T and Z. mangrovi DSM 24499T. The major fatty acids of strain CPA58T were 

iso-C15:0, summed feature 3 (iso-C15:0 2-OH and/or C16:1 ?7c) and iso-C17:0 3-OH, which accounted for 

over 45?% of the total fatty acids. The results are presented in Table 4.10 and are in accordance with 

what is described for the genus Zunongwangia.

The differences in physiological, biochemical and chemotaxonomic characteristics between strain 

CPA58T, Z. profunda DSM 18752T and Z. mangrovi DSM 24499T are given in Table 4.9. The 16S rRNA 

gene sequence similarity between strain CPA58T and Z. profunda SM-A87T and Z. mangrovi P2E16T 

strongly indicates that strain CPA58T belongs to the genus Zunongwangia. Strain CPA58T represents, 

however, a novel and distinct species since it can be differentiated from other type strains of the 

genus on the basis of physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics. Additionally, organisms 

that present a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity below 97 % rarely display a DNA-DNA homology 

greater than 70 % (Stackebrandt &amp;amp; Goebel, 1994), which is below the threshold for same species 



174 
 

relatedness (Wayne et al., 1987). On the basis of the data described above, strain CPA58T should 

be regarded as representing a novel species of the genus Zunongwangia, for which the name 

Zunongwangia endophytica sp. nov. is proposed. An emended description of the genus 

Zunongwangia is also proposed. 

 

Emended description of the genus Zunongwangia Qin et al. 2007, emend. Rameshkumar 

et al. 2014 

The description of the genus Zunongwangia is as given by Qin et al. (2007) and Rameshkumar et al.

hydrolysis of Tween 20, but negative for oxidase, siderophore production, ACC deaminase activity, 

DNA hydrolysis, citrate utilization, H2S production, and hydrolysis of starch, carboxymethyl cellulose 

and casein (hydrolysis of skim milk). Cannot grow under anaerobic conditions, but presents 

microaerobic behavior. Flexirubin-type pigments were absent. On MA plates forms smooth and 

creamy yellow colonies with smooth regular edges, of 0.6–2.2 mm in diameter after incubating at 

26 °C for 48 h. Slightly halophilic, grows in the presence of 2–10?% NaCl (optimum 2–3?%), at 4–30 

°C (optimum 26 °C) and at pH 6–9 (optimum 6–8). The main fatty acids are iso-C15:0, iso-C17:0 3-OH, 

and summed feature 3 (iso-C15:0 2-OH and/or C16:1 ?7c). The major respiratory quinone is MK-6. In 

the API 20NE test, it can hydrolyze esculin (?-glucosidase), gelatin (protease) and para-nitrophenyl-

Abstract 

Seven motile Gram-stain negative endophytic strains were isolated from surface-sterilized tissues 

of the halophyte Halimione portulacoides collected from a salt marsh in Ria de Aveiro, Portugal. 

These strains were analyzed in order to determine their exact taxonomic position, using five closely 

related type strains of Salinicola spp. in comparative analyses. Genome sequencing and its 

comparison indicated that five of the seven isolated strains comprised five distinct and novel 

species (average nucleotide identity &amp;lt;0.95; in silico DNA-DNA hybridization &amp;lt;70 %; G+C difference 

&gt; 1 %). A multilocus sequence analysis was performed using gyrB, rpoD and 16S rRNA gene 

sequences from endophytic strains from the present study and type strains to determine their 

phylogenetic positions. The novel strains are facultative anaerobes, mesophilic, facultative 

alkaliphic and halophilic, test positive for catalase and oxidase activities, for hydrolysis of Tween 20 

and phosphate, production of IAA, but do not produce H2S. Ubiquinone Q-9 is present in major 

amounts in all strains and the major fatty acids included C16:0 and the summed feature containing 

C18:1 ?7c and/or C18:1 ?6c. The DNA G+C content ranged from 60.6 to 65.8 mol%. Genomic, 

biochemical and physiological characteristics confirmed five strains as new species belonging to the 

genus Salinicola, for which the names Salinicola halimionae sp. nov. (type strain CPA60T = CECT 

9338T = LMG 30107T), Salinicola aestuarina sp. nov. (type strain CPA62T = CECT 9339T = LMG 

30108T), Salinicola endophytica sp. nov. (type strain CPA92T = CECT 9340T = LMG 30109T), Salinicola 

halophytica sp. nov. (type strain CR45T = CECT 9341T = LMG 30105T) and Salinicola lusitana sp. nov. 

(type strain CR50T = CECT 9342T = LMG 30106T) are proposed.

Background 

Halomonadaceae family 

The family Halomonadaceae belongs to the class Gammaproteobacteria and was proposed by 

Franzmann et al. (1988). This family was initially described as harboring non-spore forming Gram-

negative oxidase-positive rods that require NaCl for growth. Ubiquinones were determined to be 

the respiratory lipoquinone class present in this family, and G+C content ranged from 52 to 68 

mol%. At the time, the family was described as including the genera: Halomonas, the type genus of 

the family, and Deleya (Franzmann et al., 1988). Subsequent analyses of the 16S rRNA gene 

sequence lead to addition of the genera Chromohalobacter and Volcaniella in the Halomonas-

Deleya cluster, with reclassification of the type species of the genus Volcaniella as pertaining to the 

genus Halomonas (Mellado et al., 1995). The following year, species of the genera Deleya and 

Halovibrio, as well as the species Paracoccus halodenitrificans, were reclassified as members of the 

genus Halomonas (Dobson &amp;amp; Franzmann, 1996). These authors also proposed the inclusion of the 

monospecific genus Zymobacter (Okamoto et al., 1993) in the family Halomonadaceae.  

The fast growing genus Halomonas soon demanded a more extensive analysis to understand the 

relationships of its different species. Mata et al. (2002) performed a detailed phenotypic 

characterization of the 21 Halomonas species described at the time, detailing and citing many 

methodologies that are still currently used in the description of new taxa of the family 

Halomonadaceae. Further phylogenetic analyses based on 16S and 23S rRNA gene sequences of 

the three genera of the family allowed clarification of early confusion on phylogenetic positioning 

of species in the family Halomonadaceae: the phylogenetic positions of species of the genera 

Chromohalobacter and Zymobacter were confirmed, and it was determined that the genus 

Halomonas comprehended two distinguishable phylogenetic groups (Arahal et al., 2002a). The 

family Halomonadaceae grew as novel genera were described: Carnimonas (Arahal et al., 2002a), 

Cobetia (Arahal et al., 2002b), Halotalea (Ntougias et al., 2007), Modicisalibacter (Gam et al., 2007), 

Salinicola (Anan’ina et al., 2007), Aidingimonas (Wang et al., 2009) and Larsenia (León et al., 2014). 

Reclassifications continued to occur as the genus Cobetia was described by reassigning a species 

previously included in the genus Halomonas (Arahal et al., 2002b). In 2009, Sánchez-Porro et al. 

described the novel genus Kushneria and proposed the reclassification of three Halomonas species 

into this new genus. More reclassifications occurred in 2010, when the genus Salinicola 

accommodated two additional species, one previously included in the genus Halomonas and 

another previously included in the genus Chromohalobacter (de la Haba et al., 2010b).  



181 
 

Early on meetings of the Subcommittee on the Taxonomy of the Halomonadaceae family stressed 

the importance of the determination of recommended minimal standards for the description of 

new taxa in the family and the importance of using a high quality full or near full length sequence 

of 16S rRNA gene (Vreeland &amp;amp; Ventosa, 2003). A set of required and recommended minimal 

standards to describe new Halomonadaceae members was detailed by Arahal et al. (2007). These 

authors emphasized the importance of a high quality (&amp;lt;0.5 % ambiguity) and near full length (&gt; 

1400 nt) 16S rRNA gene sequence, and the importance of treeing methods, seen as different 

methods may result in differences in topologies, and should be evaluated by statistical methods 

such as bootstrap analysis.  

The description of the family has been emended over time, and earlier emends were mainly 

concerned with updating signature nucleotides in the 16S rRNA gene sequence that were family-

specific (Dobson &amp;amp; Franzmann, 1996; Ntougias et al., 2007; Gam et al., 2007). However, de la Haba 

et al. (2010a) stated that the use of signature nucleotides was an arbitrary feature, and suggested 

that using the complete or almost complete sequence of the 16S rRNA gene would be more 

coherent. These authors investigated the phylogenetic relationships among Halomonadaceae 

members based on, not only 16S rRNA gene sequence, but also on the 23S rRNA gene sequence. It 

was observed that the resolution using 23S rRNA gene sequence was higher than that observed 

with 16S rRNA gene sequence, however, still not enough to resolve closely related species (de la 

Haba et al., 2010a). To overcome this issue, an approach based on multi locus sequence analysis 

(MLSA) of housekeeping genes was later proposed by de la Haba et al. (2012). These authors 

concluded that the combination of the genes coding for 16S rRNA, DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB) and 

RNA polymerase sigma 70 factor (rpoD) was adequate for MLSA analysis in the family 

Halomonadaceae. In fact, the 2013 update of recommended minimal standards for description of 

new Halomonadaceae taxa included the MLSA approach with the three aforementioned genes 

(Oren &amp;amp; Ventosa, 2013).  

At the time of writing, the most recent Subcommittee on the Taxonomy of the Halomonadaceae 

family recognized 11 genera and a total of 116 species in this family. This publication also informed 

that the recommended minimal standards include those detailed by Arahal et al. (2007) 

supplemented by the MLSA approach of de la Haba et al. (2012) (Oren &amp;amp; Ventosa, 2016).

The genus Salinicola 

The genus Salinicola was introduced in the family Halomonadaceae as a monospecific genus (S. 

socius) which encompasses Gram-negative rods that do not form spores, are motile by means of a 

single polar flagellum, react positively in the O/F test, and are catalase-positive and oxidase-

negative (Anan’ina et al., 2007). This monospecific genus was also described as being moderately 

halophilic, mesophilic, and as presenting optimal growth from 30 to 37 °C (Anan’ina et al., 2007). 

As described for the family, the predominant ubiquinone was Q-9 and the major fatty acids 

detected were C16:1 ?7c, C16:0, C18:1 ?7c, and cyclic-C19:0. The G+C content for the type species was 

determined as 63 mol%, which is included in the range described for the family Halomonadaceae 

(52-68 mol%, Franzmann et al., 1988).  

A polyphasic approach with analyses of the 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA gene sequences, and 

phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characterization allowed reclassification of two species 

previously assigned to the genera Halomonas (H. salaria) and Chromohalobacter (C. salarius) to the 

genus Salinicola as S. salarius and S. halophilus, respectively (de la Haba et al., 2010b). These 

authors included an extensive emend to the genus, of which the following features are of relevance: 

growth is observed in the range of 15 to 40 °C, respiration on fumarate, nitrate and nitrite are not 

observed, Tween 20 is hydrolyzed, but casein, DNA, tyrosine and aesculin are not (de la Haba et al., 

2010b).  

Since then, several species have been described in the genus, namely Salinicola peritrichatus (Huo 

et al., 2013), S. zeshunii (Cao et al., 2013), S. acroporae (Lepcha et al., 2015) and S. rhizosphaerae 

(Raju et al., 2016). These species were mostly isolated from salt-rich environments such as salt mine 

(S. socius), saline water (S. salarius), solar saltern (S. halophilus), deep-sea sediment (S. 

peritrichatus), corals (S. acroporae) and mangrove (S. rhizosphaerae).

Motivation 

Our assessment of culturable endophytic bacteria from Halimione portulacoides yielded 665 

isolates (Fidalgo et al., 2016), seven of which are the focus of the present section. These isolates 

were obtained from aboveground (CPA60T, CPA62T and CPA92T) and from belowground tissues 

(CR45T, CR50T, CR57 and RZ23) of the halophyte, and were identified as Salinicola spp. (Fidalgo et 

al., 2016). A preliminary assessment of the 16S rRNA gene sequence suggested that these isolates 

could represent novel species of the genus Salinicola. Our aim was then to determine the exact 

taxonomic position of these strains within the family Halomonadaceae and fully characterize the 

putative new Salinicola species using a polyphasic approach. To do so, we followed specifications 

of the recommended minimal standards in Arahal et al. (2007) and the most recent International 

Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes Subcommittee on the taxonomy of Halobacteriaceae and 

subcommittee on the taxonomy of Halomonadaceae (Oren &amp;amp; Ventosa, 2016). 

 

 

Methods 

Strains and culture medium 

Endophytic Salinicola spp. strains CPA60T, CPA62T, CPA92T, CR45T, CR50T, CR57 and RZ23 were firstly 

isolated and regularly cultured in Marine Agar medium (MA, Difco Laboratories, France). Closely 

related type strains of five Salinicola species were used as reference strains for comparison in 

phenotypic and molecular characterization tests: Salinicola socius DSM 19940T, Salinicola salarius 

DSM 18044T, Salinicola acroporae LMG 28587T, Salinicola halophilus CECT 5903T, and Salinicola 

peritrichatus JCM 18795T. The reference type strains were also maintained on MA.  

 

DNA extraction, genome sequencing and analysis 

To accomplish the minimal standards recommended by Arahal et al. (2007) and de la Haba et al. 

(2012), a MLSA approach was conducted. For this, DNA of endophytic strains and related type 

strains of the genus Salinicola was extracted using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit 

(Promega, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. DNA quality was attested by running the 

samples on a 0.8 % agarose gel, and DNA quantification was determined using a Qubit fluorimeter 



184 
 

(Thermo Scientific, USA). Whole genome sequencing was conducted at Stabvida (Portugal) using an 

Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform. The raw sequences were analyzed using CLC Genomics Workbench 

version 9.5.3 using a 2 nucleotide cutoff for ambiguity limit, a 0.01 quality limit (error probability) 

and a minimum number of nucleotides of 30. The quality of the data was checked with the FastQC 

tool (Andrews, 2010) and the sequences were de novo assembled. The genomes were annotated 

with the Rapid Annotation using System Technology (RAST; Aziz et al., 2008; Overbeek et al., 2014) 

and the rRNA gene sequences were predicted using the RNAmmer1.2 server (Lagesen et al., 2007). 

The G+C content and gene sequences for 16S rRNA, GyrB and RpoD for endophytic and related type 

strains of Salinicola species were obtained from genomic sequences. Sequences for these genes 

from the recently published Salinicola rhizosphaerae MSSRFH1T and from Halomonas elongata DSM 

2581T were obtained from the EzTaxon database (16S rRNA gene; Kim et al., 2012) and NCBI 

database (gyrB and rpoD; NCBI Resource Coordinators, 2016). The closest relatives based on 16S 

rRNA gene sequence similarity were identified against the EzTaxon database (Kim et al., 2012). The 

average nucleotide identity (ANI) and tetra-nucleotide signature correlation index (TETRA) were 

obtained using the online tool JSpeciesWS (Richter et al., 2016) and genome-to-genome distance 

calculator (GGDC) was obtained through the web service described in Meier-Kolthoff et al. (2013).  

The 16S rRNA, gyrB and rpoD gene sequences were aligned using the online tool Clustal Omega 

(McWilliam et al., 2013) and the alignment was edited with BioEdit version 7.2.5 (Hall, 1999). 

Phylogenetic analyses were performed on the three genes separately and concatenated (Villesen, 

2007) using MEGA version 6.0 (Tamura et al., 2013). Clustering using neighbour-joining (NJ, Saitou 

&amp;amp; Nei, 1987) and maximum-likelihood (ML, Felsenstein, 1981) methods was performed using the 

Kimura two-parameter model (Kimura, 1980). Clustering was additionally performed using the 

maximum parsimony method (MP, Fitch, 1971), and bootstrap values based on 1000 replications 

were calculated in all the phylogenetic analyses.  

 

Morphological and phenotypic assays 

Conditions for optimal growth were assessed using the following medium (adapted from Ventosa 

et al., 1982): 5 g L-1 proteose peptone no. 3 (Merck, USA), 10 g L-1 yeast extract (Alfa Aesar, USA), 1 

g L-1 glucose (Merck, USA), and pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH (2 M; JMGS, Portugal). NaCl tolerance 

was tested using concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20, 25 and 30? % (w/v). 

At the optimum NaCl concentration for growth, the temperature range and optimum was tested 

by incubating at 4, 15, 20, 25, 30, 37, 40 and 45 °C. At the optimal growth temperature and NaCl 



185 
 

concentration for growth, the pH range and optimum was assessed for pH levels 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8.5, 9 

and 10. For the pH assays, the medium was buffered adequately, using 4-Morpholineethanesulfonic 

acid (MES buffer from Sigma, USA; pH 4 to 5), piperazine-N,N?-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES 

buffer from Panreac, Spain; pH 6 to 7), Tricine buffer (from Sigma, USA; pH 8 to 8.5) and 3-

(Cyclohexylamino)-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid (CAPSO buffer, from Sigma, USA; pH 9 to 10), 

all prepared at a concentration of 40 mM. The assays were conducted in 96-well plates, with 200 

µL of adequate medium and an inoculum of 5 µL from a cell suspension with optical density at 590 

nm (OD590) of 0.5, prepared in NaCl 0.9 % (w/v). The plates were incubated up to 7 days, and OD590 

readings were registered at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 120, 144 and 168 h. Growth curves were 

drafted and allowed determination of optimal growth conditions. A difference of 0.1 in OD590 from 

time 0 h was used as the cutoff for growth in these assays. 

For the remaining tests, unless otherwise stated, strain growth was obtained on MA by incubating 

at 30 °C for 48 h. A Gram staining was performed using Merck’s (Germany) Gram staining set, 

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Light microscopy allowed assessment of cell 

morphology, size and motility. Catalase activity was determined using the H2O2-reagent, and 

oxidase activity was evaluated using oxidase strips (both from Liofilchem, Italy). Oxygen metabolism 

was assessed using thioglycollate medium (Merck, Germany) supplemented with 7.5 % NaCl, and 

growth was monitored for 7 days. DNA hydrolysis was determined on DNase agar (HiMedia, India) 

supplemented with 0.1 % toluidine blue and with 7.5 % NaCl. Simmon’s Citrate Agar (Oxoid, USA) 

supplemented with 7.5 % NaCl was used to determine citrate utilization. Kligler’s Iron Agar (Merck, 

Germany) supplemented with 7.5 % NaCl was used to assess production of H2S. Casein, starch, 

tween 20, cellulose, pectin (at pH 5 and 7) and xylan hydrolysis, phosphate solubilization, 

siderophore production, ACC deaminase activity and IAA production were assessed as described in 

Fidalgo et al. (2016). Miniaturized assays API 20NE, API ZYM and API 50CH (bioMérieux, France) 

were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions, except for using a 4 % sea salts (Sigma, 

USA) solution to prepare cell suspensions. Closely related type strains of Salinicola species were 

assayed in the same conditions for comparative purposes.  

The fatty acid profile and isoprenoid quinone determination was conducted as described in Proença 

et al. (2014) and performed in parallel with related Salinicola type strains. Growth for determination 

of isoprenoid quinones was obtained using Marine Broth (MB) and incubating at 30 °C for 72 h. The 

G+C content (mol%) was additionally determined by HPLC (Mesbah et al., 1989).

Results and discussion 

Genomic analysis 

The genome annotation performed with the RAST online tool (Aziz et al., 2008; Overbeek et al., 

2014) allowed for the determination of several important metrics regarding the sequenced 

genomes, such as sequence size, information about contig number and length, genome sequencing 

coverage, and G+C content (Table 4.11). Genome size varied between 3.62 and 4.63 Mbp, and the 

number of contigs varied from 13 to 120. The smallest number of contigs that contains half the 

sequenced genome (L50) was relatively low overall (2 to 8, and 16 for Salinicola peritrichatus JCM 

18795T), indicating that the Illumina Hiseq platform allows for very large read lengths, which is 

desirable for this type of work.  

 

The G+C content obtained from genome sequence data differed from wet lab experiments in 

almost all instances (Table 4.11). This difference comes from the fact that, despite the importance 

of this value in new taxa description, experimentally determined G+C contents are prone to 

inaccuracies due to measurement error and heterogeneity in methodologies (Kim et al., 2015). 

These authors indicate that the difference between values obtained in wet lab experiments and 

genome sequence data may differ in more than 1 %, and this is also observed in our work. The 

higher accuracy that is inherent to using G+C contents obtained from genome data allows the use 

of the cutoff of 1 % in G+C content variation to validate the existence of a new species (Kim et al., 

2015), which has already been established in online tools (Richter et al., 2016). 

The G+C contents observed for the endophytic strains are well within the range determined for the 

Halomonadaceae family (52 to 68 mol%; Franzmann et al., 1988). Although there is no range 

established for the genus Salinicola, values reported for the species previously described are within 

a range of G+C content from 58.8 (Salinicola salarius; Kim et al., 2007) to 64.0 (Salinicola 

rhizosphaerae; Raju et al., 2016). Considering only the values obtained from genome sequence data 

– which is what will be done from this point on –, the values for G+C content of the endophytic 

strains are either within this range or slightly above (60.6 to 65.9, Table 4.11). Since there are only 

six members of the genus validly described thus far, and that the threshold of 10 % divergence is 

not crossed (Owen &amp;amp; Pitcher, 1985), the endophytic strains may be considered to belong to the 

genus Salinicola. The difference in G+C content that will allow validation of novel species is further 

explored in the pairwise comparison of the endophytic strains and type strains of Salinicola.

The full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences (1528 bp) of the endophytic and related Salinicola strains 

were obtained from RAST annotation. The sequences from the endophytic strains were then 

compared to the EzTaxon database (Kim et al., 2012) to obtain a 16S rRNA gene-based 

identification. The results are listed in Table 4.12 and clearly place all endophytic strains in the genus 

Salinicola. The lowest similarity percentage observed is higher than the cutoff for delimitation of a 

novel species based on 16S rRNA gene sequence (97 %, Stackebrandt &amp;amp; Goebel, 1994; Wayne et al., 

1987), however, this gene sequence is not the most adequate to resolve closely related species in 

the family Halomonadaceae (de la Haba et al., 2010a).  

 

To overcome this shortcoming of the 16S rRNA gene sequence-based approach, a genome 

sequence-based pairwise comparison was performed, in which the value for average nucleotide 

identity (ANI) of pairs of strains is obtained. The ANI value was calculated using the parameters for 

ANIb (BLAST-based ANI), ANIm (MUMmer-based ANI), in addition to the TETRA parameter (Richter 

&amp;amp; Rosselló-Móra, 2009) with the online tool JSpeciesSW (Richter et al., 2016). According to the 

considerations of the authors of the parameters and recent evaluations (Figueras et al., 2014), ANI 

&gt; 95-96 % indicates that strains belong to the same species.  

A traditional methodology to assess if a pair of strains belong to the same species is to perform 

DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH), however this approach is prone to experimental error and has been 

replaced by genome sequence-based approaches (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2013). These authors 

proposed the calculation of in silico DDH (isDDH) by genome blast distance phylogeny (GBDP) as an 

alternative to the traditional DDH method. This isDDH value was then calculated for the endophytic 

strains against the closely related type Salinicola strains.  

The G+C content difference was also calculated using the tool proposed by Meier-Kolthoff et al. 

(2013) and the pairwise difference of G+C content is also used as a parameter to validate the 

presence of a new species. A difference in G+C content over 1 % rejects the hypothesis that the pair 

of strains belongs to the same species (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2014).

The results of the genome sequence-based pairwise comparisons are given in Table 4.13 and show 

that the threshold of ANI value (&gt; 95-96 %) for species delineation is not surpassed for the 

endophytic strains CPA60T, CPA62T, CPA92T, CR45T and CR50T. For these strains, some TETRA values 

are over the threshold for species boundary (&gt; 0.99, Richter &amp;amp; Rosselló-Móra, 2009), however, this 

parameter should only be considered when it is in agreement with ANI values greater than 95-96 

% (Richter &amp;amp; Rosselló-Móra, 2009).  

The isDDH parameter confirms these five endophytic strains represent different species from the 

currently described in the genus Salinicola. The difference in values of G+C content between strains 

also supports our claim that the endophytic strains represent novel genomic species of Salinicola, 

as the value of 1 % in difference is surpassed in most comparisons. According to these results, the 

endophytic strains CPA60T, CPA62T, CPA92T, CR45T and CR50T represent novel Salinicola species. 

The endophytic strains RZ23 and CR57, however, present parameters for ANIb, ANim, TETRA, 

isDDH, and differences in G+C content that support that they are members of the same species as 

CPA92T and CR50T, respectively. 

 

Phylogenetic analysis 

In order to perform the MLSA approach, required for the description of new taxa in the 

Halomonadaceae family (Arahal et al., 2007; de la Haba et al., 2012), the full sequences of the 16S 

rRNA gene, gyrB and rpoD genes were retrieved from the annotated genomes of the endophytic 

strains and the related Salinicola type species. Additional sequences were used, namely from the 

recently published Salinicola rhizosphaerae MSSRFH1T and Halomonas elongata DSM 2581T, and 

the accession numbers used are listed in Table 4.14.  

Phylogenetic trees were built with NJ, ML and MP clustering methods, for each gene separately 

(Figure 4.6), and for the concatenated sequences of the three genes (Figure 4.7).

Figure 4.6 Neighbour-joining (NJ) phylogenetic trees showing the phylogenetic positions of strains CPA60T, 

CPA62T, CPA92T, RZ23, CR45T, CR50T, CR57 and representatives of other related taxa based on 16S rRNA gene 

(a), gyrB (b) and rpoD (c) sequences. Filled circles indicate nodes that were also recovered in maximum 

parsimony (MP) trees, and empty circles indicate nodes also recovered from maximum-likelihood (ML) trees, 

based on the same sequences. Bootstrap values (expressed as percentages of 1000 replications) ? 50 % are 

shown at branch points for NJ/ML/MP trees. Halomonas elongata DSM 2581T was used as outgroup. Bar 

indicates nucleotide substitution rate (Knuc) units. 

 

The phylogenetic trees obtained for each separate gene show that the congruence among 

clustering methods is not complete, since several of the branches observed in the NJ tree are not 

mirrored in the ML and MP trees. This was especially true for the rpoD gene-based phylogenetic 

tree (Figure 4.6c). This result highlights the importance of using a MLSA approach. The MLSA tree 

shows higher, albeit not complete, congruence among the three clustering methods (Figure 4.7). 

This indicates that the observed topology and phylogenetic positions of the endophytic strains are 

robust and stable, supporting our claim that the endophytic strains CPA60T, CPA62T, CPA92T, CR45T 

and CR50T are, in fact, new species of the Salinicola genus, and that strains RZ23 and CR57 belong 

to the same species as CPA92T and CR50T, respectively.

CPA62T, CPA92T, RZ23, CR45T, CR50T, CR57 and representatives of other related taxa based on the 

concatenated sequences of the 16S rRNA, gyrB and rpoD genes. The topology of the maximum-likelihood 

(ML) tree was the same as for the NJ tree. Filled circles indicate nodes that were also recovered in maximum 

parsimony (MP) trees, based on the same sequences. Bootstrap values (expressed as percentages of 1000 

replications) ? 50 % are shown at branch points for NJ/ML/MP trees. Halomonas elongata DSM 2581T was 

used as outgroup. Bar indicates nucleotide substitution rate (Knuc) units. 

 

Morphological and phenotypic analysis 

The optimal conditions for growth were determined and are detailed in the species description for 

each type strain. All strains are moderately halophilic and mesophilic, which is in accordance with 

what has been observed for validly described Salinicola species. All strains are Gram-negative, 

catalase- and oxidase-positive motile rods, facultative anaerobes that do not produce H2S. Citrate 

degradation was observed for all strains (weak in the case of CPA62T), as was Tween 20 hydrolysis, 

phosphate solubilization and IAA production. Casein was not degraded by any of the endophytic 

strains.  

In the API 20NE strip, all strains were negative for reduction of nitrates to nitrites, indole 

production, fermentation of D-glucose, arginine dihydrolase, hydrolysis of gelatin (protease), and 

assimilation of adipic acid and phenylacetic acid. In the API ZYM strip, all strains were positive for 

acid and alkaline phosphatase, leucine and valine arylamidase, and negative for lipase (C14), cystine 



197 
 

arylamidase, trypsin, ?-chymotrypsin, ?-galactosidase, ?-galactosidase, ?-glucuronidase, N-acetyl-

?-glucosaminidase, ?-mannosidase and ?-fucosidase. In the API 50CH strip, all strains were positive 

for D-galactose, D-glucose, D-ribose, D-xylose and L-arabinose assimilation, and negative for 

amidon (starch), amygdalin, arbutin, D-adonitol, D-arabitol, D-melezitose, D-raffinose, gentiobiose, 

glycogen, inositol, inulin, L-arabitol, L-fucose, L-xylose, methyl-?-D-glucopyranoside, methyl-?-D-

mannopyranoside, methyl-?-D-xylopyranoside, N-acetylglucosamine, potassium 2-ketogluconate, 

potassium 5-ketogluconate, potassium gluconate, salicin and xylitol. The variable results for the 

remaining assays are detailed in the species description for each novel Salinicola species. 

The Q-9 was the major respiratory quinone for all strains, which is in agreement with what has been 

described for the genus. The major fatty acids overall were C16:0 and the summed feature containing 

C18:1 ?7c and/or C18:1 ?6c. The cyclo-C19:0 ?8c is also a major fatty acid but only for strains CR45
T 

and CR50T. The complete fatty acid profiles of the endophytic strains and reference strains are given 

in Table 4.15. According to the description of the genus Salinicola, C16:1 ?7c, C16:0, C18:1 ?7c and 

cyclo-C19:0 are the major fatty acids (Anan’ina et al., 2007). The unsaturated fatty acid C16:1 ?7c was 

listed as a major fatty acid by Anan’ina et al. (2007) when the genus was composed by a single 

species, despite the fact that this fatty acid comprised only 8.6 % of the total fatty acids, and has 

not been considered a major fatty acid since that publication. The cyclo-C19:0 described in Anan’ina 

et al. (2007) as a major fatty acid has not had the same designation in other papers, where it has 

been referenced as cyclo-C19:0 ?8c, and has been, in fact, observed in high percentages. The C16:0 

and C18:1 ?7c fatty acids have been observed as major fatty acids in every Salinicola species validly 

published so far, and this is also observed with the endophytic strains, where the latter is listed 

under the summed feature containing C18:1 ?7c and/or C18:1 ?6c. A more appropriate characteristic 

list of main fatty acids is given in the emended description of the genus, based not only on our 

results, but also on those published since the last amendment.  

 

Considering the genomic, phylogenetic and biochemical and physiological characteristics, it is clear 

the CPA60T, CPA62T, CPA92T, CR45T, CR50T strains are affiliated with the genus Salinicola. These 

strains are, nevertheless, distinguishable from other validly described Salinicola species, and 

differentiating traits are stated in Table 4.16. Accordingly, CPA60T, CPA62T, CPA92T, CR45T, CR50T 

represent novel species of the genus Salinicola, and the names Salinicola halimionae sp. nov., 

Salinicola aestuarina sp. nov., Salinicola endophytica sp. nov., Salinicola halophytica sp. nov. and 

Salinicola lusitana sp. nov., respectively, are proposed.

Abstract  

Fifteen healthy specimens of Halimione portulacoides were collected from a salt marsh in Ria de 

Aveiro. Surface-sterilized aboveground (AG) and belowground (BG) tissues of the halophyte were 

analyzed for their diversity of endophytic bacteria using a culture-independent high-throughput 

16S rRNA gene sequencing method. The interference of host DNA in the analysis was decreased by 

including PNA blockers in the 16S rRNA gene amplification reaction. The methodology used allowed 

for a high sequencing coverage for all samples (median 97.5 %) and revealed a high operational 

taxonomic units (OTUs) richness (median of 200 OTUs per sample). Results showed significant 

differences according to sampling tissue, where BG tissues presented higher OTU richness and 

diversity. Community structure was also found to differ according to sampling tissue, and this 

difference may be associated with a large number of rare OTUs. Overall, the main phyla observed 

in the endosphere of the halophyte were Proteobacteria (62.5 % OTUs), Bacteroidetes (10.7 %), 

Planctomycetes (8.8 %), Actinobacteria (5.2 %) and Firmicutes (2.4 %). Core endophytome analyses 

revealed that the AG tissues mainly comprised members of the family Oceanospirillaceae, and also 

included the families Flammeovirgaceae, Enterobacteriaceae and Flavobacteriaceae, while the BG 

endophytome was dominated by Enterobacteriaceae and Kiloniellaceae. This work explored the 

diversity of the bacterial endophytome of H. portulacoides in depth and confirmed it as a bacterial 

hotspot. Putative ecological functions of the dominant taxa revealed a community that presented 

several plant growth promotion traits. 

 

  



218 
 

Background 

Plant-associated microbes are ecologically relevant due to their roles in various processes including 

nutrient acquisition and cycling, protection against pathogens, and production of traits that allow 

the plant to thrive (Hardoim et al., 2015; Santoyo et al., 2016). In order to understand the potential 

of a plant host, it should be seen as a holobiont, thus requiring an extensive knowledge of the 

structure and diversity of the complex host-associated microbial community (reviewed in 

Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015). Culture-based methodologies have been thoroughly used to 

characterize such communities, however, this approach relies on the ability of the microbes to grow 

in laboratory conditions. This conditioning, whether in terms of nutrient availability, temperature, 

pressure, or other conditions, usually results in a collection of microbes that represents a minor 

fraction of the community (Amann et al., 1995; Tanaka et al., 2014). 

Recent advances in amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing and its broad application have 

allowed for a more comprehensive assessment of plant-associated bacterial communities. The 

focus of these studies has been largely aimed at the microbes present in the rhizospheric portion, 

since this type of environment is very abundant in ecologically relevant microbes (Philippot et al., 

2013). The endosphere, albeit also rich in relevant microbes (Hardoim et al., 2015), has been less 

explored. The reason for this may be attributed to the impairment caused by the presence of plant 

organelle DNA in the samples used in endophytic bacterial diversity assessments. In healthy plant 

specimens, these samples present a low ratio of bacterial:host cells, and the latter may contain up 

to tens of thousands of organelle genomes in each cell, depending on the plant species (Bendich, 

1987). Since organelle genomes contain DNA sequences similar to the widely used 16S rRNA gene 

for bacterial identification, the molecular-based techniques often result in an output rich in 

organelle reads, and less so in bacterial reads. 

 

  



219 
 

Motivation 

Our assessment of culturable endophytic bacteria from Halimione portulacoides yielded 665 

isolates (Chapter 3), and it is considered that the culturable fraction shows a small fraction of the 

diversity within a microbial community (Amann et al., 1995). Since the main purpose of the present 

work was to have an understanding of the bacterial diversity in the halophyte H. portulacoides, it 

was our aim to explore this diversity using a culture-independent, molecular-based, high-

throughput technique. Since the diversity of culturable bacteria exhibited significant differences in 

abovegound and belowground tissues, here we also focused on the exploration of these 

compartments separately.  

Our aim was, then, to achieve a deeper understanding of the bacterial diversity present in the 

surface-sterilized AG and BG tissues of H. portulacoides collected in Ria de Aveiro. This will allow us 

to determine the core bacterial endophytome associated with the halophyte.

Methods 

Study area and sampling  

Sampling was performed in a salt marsh in the estuary Ria de Aveiro (40° 38? 05.36? N, 8° 39? 38.87? 

W; site C from Chapter 3) during low tide in December 2015 (average temperature 11 °C). Fifteen 

healthy specimens of the halophyte H. portulacoides were collected in monospecific stands, in the 

design exposed in Figure 5.1. Three roughly equidistant plots were chosen for sampling. From each 

of the three plots, five whole plants were extracted from three monospecific stands of H. 

portulacoides: three plants from stand A, one plant from stand B and one plant from stand C. This 

differential sampling was performed to understand if the community was affected by the sampling 

stand. Samples were transported to the laboratory and promptly processed.

Ria de Aveiro. Three roughly equidistant plots were chosen (Plot 1, 2 and 3), and in each plot three 

monospecific stands of H. portulacoides were sampled: in the first stand (stand A) three specimens of the 

halophyte were collected, and one specimen from stand B and another from stand C were collected.

Sample processing, DNA extraction, 16S rRNA gene amplification and amplicon sequencing 

In the laboratory, the fifteen plants were washed with running tap water and the AG tissues were 

separated from BG tissues, resulting in 30 individual samples. A detailed description of the 30 

samples is given in Table 5.1.

Surface sterilization was performed as described before (Chapter 3) and aliquots (100 µL) of water 

from the last wash were used as inoculum in Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA, Merck, Germany) medium. The 

absence of growth after 7 days incubating at 30 °C confirmed the efficacy of the sterilization 

procedure.  

Portions of the samples were macerated using a micro-pestle in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. DNA 

extraction was conducted using the MoBio PowerPlant DNA Isolation kit (USA) according to the 

manufacturer’s instructions with the exception that the DNA was eluted in PCR-grade water (Sigma, 

USA) in the final step. DNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using NanoDrop 

ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific, USA). PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was performed using 25 

ng of template DNA, 0.2 µM of primer 341F (5’-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3’; Muyzer et al., 1993) 

and 805R (5’-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3’; Skirnisdottir et al., 2000), 2 µM of mPNA and pPNA 

(Lundberg et al., 2013; PNAbio, USA), and 2X KAPA HiFi Ready Mix (KAPA Biosystems, USA). Prior to 

using the mPNA and pPNA in the reaction, these reagents were allowed to solubilize at 55 °C for 30 

min. Conditions for amplification were as follows: one cycle at 95 °C (3 min), followed by 30 cycles 

at 98 °C (20 sec), 75 °C (10 sec), 55 °C (30 sec) and 72 °C (30 sec), with a final extension at 72 °C (5 

min). The PCR amplification was also conducted on a randomly chosen sample (sample 11) without 

addition of the mPNA and pPNA reagents, in order to understand the effect of the PNA blockers in 

the Illumina MiSeq sequencing results. This sample is regarded from now on as sample -PNA, and 

the 30 samples for which the PCR reactions were performed with addition of PNA blockers are 

regarded as +PNA. 

At the sequencing company (Biocant, Portugal), the samples were subjected to an electrophoresis 

on agarose gel [1 % (w/v)] and the 490 bp amplicons were purified using AMPure XP beads 

(Agencourt, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. A second PCR reaction added indexes 

and sequencing adaptors to both ends of the amplified target region using 2X KAPA HiFi HotStart 

Ready Mix, 5 µL of each index (i7 and i5) (Nextera XT Index Kit, Illumina, USA) and 5 µL of the first 

PCR product in a total volume of 50 µL. The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C (3 min), eight 

cycles of 95 °C (30 sec), 55 °C (30 sec) and 72 °C (30 sec), and a final extension at 72 °C (5 min). 

Electrophoresis of the PCR products was undertaken on an agarose gel [1 % (w/v)] and the 550 bp 

amplified fragments were purified using AMPure XP beads (Agencourt, USA) according to 

manufacturer's instructions. The amplicons were quantified by fluorimetry with PicoGreen dsDNA 

quantitation kit (Invitrogen, USA), pooled at equimolar concentrations and pair-end sequenced 

using an Illumina Miseq V3 platform, according to manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, USA). 



223 
 

Data processing and analysis 

At the sequencing company, the sequenced reads were demultiplexed automatically by the 

Illumina Miseq sequencer using the CASAVA package (Illumina, USA) and quality-filtered with 

PRINSEQ software (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011) using the following parameters: (i) bases with 

average quality lower than Q25 in a window of 5 bases were trimmed, and (ii) reads with less than 

150 bases were discarded. The forward and reverse reads were merged by overlapping paired-end 

reads using the AdapterRemoval v2.1.5 (Schubert et al., 2016) software with default parameters.  

The QIIME pipeline (Caporaso et al., 2010) was used to further process the reads. For the +PNA 

samples, the 30 separate sequence files were merged into a single fasta file using the script 

split_libraries_fastq.py. The files for -PNA and +PNA samples were then searched for chimeras with 

the usearch61 method using the script identify_chimeric_seqs.py (Edgar, 2010) and the chimeric 

sequences were filtered out using the script filter_fasta.py. OTU tables with taxonomic affiliation 

were then created using the script pick_open_reference_otus.py (Rideout et al., 2014) and the 

Greengenes database (DeSantis et al., 2006). The OTU table that resulted from the -PNA sample 

was not further studied. 

The OTU table that resulted from the +PNA samples was then imported to (function read.csv; 

package utils) and analyzed with R software (R Core Team, 2016). Alpha-diversity was explored 

using several metrics included in the vegan package (Oksanen et al., 2016): Shannon’s diversity (H; 

function diversity), richness (function specnumber), Pielou’s evenness (J; obtained by calculating 

H/log10 (richness)), Simpson’s diversity (1-D; function diversity, index simpson), and inverse 

Simpson’s diversity (1/D; function diversity, index invsimpson). Additionally, the sequencing 

coverage of all samples was estimated using Chao’s coverage estimator, which takes into account 

the presence of singletons and doubletons (function coverage, package entropart; Marcon &amp;amp; 

Hérault, 2015). Each alpha-diversity metric was then statistically analyzed using functions from the 

package stats (R Core Team, 2016). First, the normality of the distribution of the values from all 

samples was tested using the Shapiro normality test (function shapiro.test). When normality was 

observed, (i) an ANOVA (function aov) was performed to assess statistical differences in this metric 

among the different plots; (ii) a t-Student test (function t.test) allowed determination of statistical 

difference among the original plant tissues. If normality was not observed, (i) plot-related 

differences were assessed by performing a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (function kruskal.test), and 

(ii) tissue-related differences were tested with the Wilcoxon rank sum test (function wilcox.test).

Rarefaction curves were obtained using the function rarecurve (package vegan) and allowed 

assessment of the sequencing depth for each sample.  

Transformation of the OTU table was performed with the functions sqrt and log10, both from the 

package base (R Core Team, 2016). Resemblance matrices of these tables were built using the 

vegdist function from the package vegan with the method Bray-Curtis. A permutational multivariate 

analysis of variance using distance matrices (PERMANOVA) was performed using the function 

adonis from the package vegan to assess the effect of the factors plot and tissue on the OTU tables. 

For instances where differences are observed among the different plots, the function 

pairwise.adonis was used to determine the plot pairs that were effectively different (Annex I). 

Ordination methods were performed with the functions metaMDS and cmdscale, both from the 

package vegan, to perform non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and principal coordinates 

analysis (PCoA), respectively.  

The MetaCoMET platform was used to perform analyses on the occurrence of OTUs among tissues 

and sampling plots (Venn diagrams), based on the same OTU data that was analyzed with R (Wang 

et al., 2016b). MetaCoMET was also used to further investigated OTUs that were shared by and 

exclusive to halophyte tissues or sampling plots, using as input: all samples, only AG samples, or 

only BG samples. A Krona pie chart tool in this platform was used to visualize taxonomic hierarchical 

data in all samples.

Results and discussion 

Samples and Illumina MiSeq sequencing 

Fifteen specimens of H. portulacoides were sampled and analyzed in order to determine the core 

endophytic microbiome of the halophyte and tissue-specific taxa. For the +PNA samples, a total of 

1761806 reads was obtained from Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Sequence filtering and processing 

steps reduced the number of reads: 1714836 reads after PRINSEQ quality filtering, 1584871 reads 

after merging paired-end sequences, 1550220 reads after demultiplexing, and 1538662 reads after 

filtering out chimeric sequences (read number per sample is detailed in Table 5.2). Overall, 87.33 % 

of the initial reads were kept after the filtering steps. For the -PNA sample, a total of 16229 reads 

was obtained after the sequence filtering and processing steps (data not shown). 

 

 

Host DNA contamination 

One of the first steps in the study of endophytic communities involved total DNA extraction, which 

comprised DNA from different sources: plant nuclei DNA, plant organelle DNA (from chloroplasts 

and mitochondria) and bacterial DNA. The proportion of bacterial:host DNA depends on the plant 

species and other factors (Jiao et al., 2006). Due to the universal nature of the primers regularly 

used for amplification of the 16S rRNA gene, the most used gene in this type of studies, 

amplification of the 16S rRNA gene from chloroplast DNA and 18S rRNA gene from mitochondrial 

DNA is very common as a result of sequence similarity. Consequently, the OTU tables that 

researchers analyze after performing high-throughput sequencing are frequently populated with 

affiliations to organelle DNA.

Common methods used to avoid host DNA contamination in culture-independent studies of 

endophytic bacteria communities have the main goal of shifting the bacterial:host DNA ratio in a 

manner that favors the amplification of bacterial template. These methods can intervene in 

different stages of the common steps in this type of study:  

(i) During DNA extraction, where specific protocols are used so that bacterial and host DNA are 

separated (Jiao et al., 2006). Briefly, this method aims to differentially select bacterial cells for 

DNA extraction by physically separating the bacterial fraction from the host tissues by using a 

sucrose gradient and differential centrifugations. Prior to the centrifugations, an enzymatic 

digestion is performed on the plant tissues, so as not to disrupt plant cells, which would enhance 

host DNA contamination from chloroplasts and mitochondria. Jiao et al. (2006) showed that 

their method of enzyme treatment of plant tissues followed by differential centrifugation 

effectively increases the ratio of bacterial:host DNA. Nevertheless, this method requires a large 

amount of plant tissue, which is not always possible to obtain, depending on the plant species 

or tissue at study. Additionally, enzymatic incubation steps prior to the differential 

centrifugation may allow for bacterial proliferation, thus altering their initial structure (Wang et 

al., 2008). Furthermore, it follows reason that the centrifugation steps may obscure some 

bacterial diversity and alter the community structure by inadvertently discarding bacterial cells 

that remained attached to plant tissue debris.  

 

(ii) After DNA extraction and prior to PCR amplification, using restriction enzymes that are 

specific for sequences in the organelle DNA (Shen &amp;amp; Fulthorpe, 2015). The DNA extraction is 

performed without distinction of host or bacterial DNA. The DNA extract is then subjected to 

enzymatic digestion (authors suggest 16 h at 37 °C) with enzymes that have restriction sites 

downstream and upstream of universal primer binding sites in chloroplast DNA. As before, a 

long enzymatic incubation step may allow for bacterial proliferation, affecting the original 

community structure. The digested samples are then used for PCR amplification using universal 

primers and the adequate sized bands are excised from the agarose gel after electrophoresis. 

This requirement to extract the band from the gel may result in loss of information during 

sample processing. The method suggested by these authors only aims at reducing host DNA 

contamination from chloroplast DNA. As such, mitochondrial DNA contamination is still 

observed after sequencing. Finally, despite the methodology applied, the authors still removed 

reads belonging to chloroplasts from the sequencing data. 



228 
 

(iii) During PCR amplification, using primers that perform a preferential amplification of bacterial 

DNA template (e.g., Chelius &amp;amp; Triplett, 2001), or using PNA blockers that prevent amplification 

of host DNA template (Lundberg et al., 2013).  

Regarding the first approach, a number of primers that are less likely to lead to organelle DNA 

amplification have been described. By far, the most used is the 799f primer, which was firstly 

described by Chelius &amp;amp; Triplett (2001). This approach allows for a regular, non-differential DNA 

extraction, yielding host DNA and bacterial DNA in the total DNA pool. From this DNA pool, the 

amplification of the 16S rRNA gene from chloroplast DNA is excluded due to sequence 

mismatches with the primer, and the amplification of the 18S rRNA gene from mitochondrial 

DNA results in an amplicon with a distinct molecular weight from that obtained from bacterial 

16S rRNA gene amplification. As a result, the bacterial amplicon can be excised from an agarose 

gel, and used for downstream applications such as sequencing (Chelius &amp;amp; Triplett, 2001). 

Nevertheless, this method presents some disadvantages. In addition to presenting sequence 

mismatches with the 16S rRNA gene sequence from chloroplast DNA, the primer 799f also 

presents mismatches with 16S rRNA gene sequences from bacterial groups, thereby introducing 

a structure and diversity bias into the resulting PCR product (Chelius &amp;amp; Triplett, 2001; Idris et al., 

2004). Additionally, this method requires the extraction of a band from an agarose gel, which, 

as mentioned before, may lead to loss of information during sample processing. Furthermore, 

the method is not fully efficient, since authors have described having observed host DNA 

matches from sequencing data obtained with 454-pyrosequencing (e.g. Bodenhausen et al., 

2013). Finally, the effectiveness of the 799f primer may result in minimal amplification of the 

bacterial sequences in the sample (Shen &amp;amp; Fulthorpe, 2015; present work, data not shown). 

The use of PNA blockers also allows for a DNA extraction protocol that yields host and bacterial 

DNA in the final DNA pool. The PNA clamps block the amplification of host organelle DNA thus 

allowing for a PCR product enriched in bacterial sequences, without introducing the bias of 

bacterial group exclusion or of subsequent technical steps that are necessary with the use of 

differential primers (Lundberg et al., 2013). The PNA blockers have been successfully used 

before in Illumina-based studies of endophytes (Carrell et al., 2016). Shen &amp;amp; Fulhorpe (2015) 

also used PNA blockers and compared results to those obtained from enzymatic digestion of 

chloroplast template DNA. After 454-pyrosequencing data analysis, the authors either obtained 

similar results regarding read number and percentage of host DNA reads, or obtained more 

reads with the PNA blockers.  



229 
 

In the present work, the taxonomic attribution for the recovered OTUs from -PNA and +PNA 

samples revealed several instances of OTU affiliation to the 16S rRNA sequence from chloroplast 

DNA and to the 18S rRNA sequence from mitochondrial DNA. For the +PNA samples, removing 

these OTUs from the OTU table returned 393184 bacterial reads, which represents 22.32 % of the 

initial read number (Table 5.2). This suggests that the utilization of PNA blockers was not sufficient 

to block amplification of all host DNA competing templates, which could be due to (i) an insufficient 

quantity of PNA blockers in the reaction, (ii) non optimal PCR conditions for the PNA clamping, or 

(iii) due to mismatches in the template sequence.  

(i) Regarding the quantity of PNA blockers used in the reaction, the concentration suggested in 

the manufacturer’s instructions is 0.25 µM per reaction, which could be increased up to 1 µM 

to improve the clamping effect. After consulting with PNAbio representatives, it was decided to 

optimize the concentration of each blocker per reaction to 2 µM. Nevertheless, it may not have 

been sufficient to block all the templates from healthy specimens of the species H. 

portulacoides. The number of copies of target template from host DNA is unknown in this 

halophyte, however, it is known that the number of copies of organelle genomes per cell can 

reach the tens of thousands in some plant species (Bendich, 1987). 

(ii) Regarding the PCR conditions used for PNA clamping, the temperature and time of PNA 

annealing were performed as suggested by the manufacturer. These conditions should present 

enough stringency to ensure proper annealing of the PNA blockers with their respective targets. 

Optimization was performed on the mPNA and pPNA solubilization step prior to PCR 

amplification: the manufacturer’s instructions suggest a 5 min incubation at 55 °C to solubilize 

the PNA blockers before adding to the PCR reaction. We performed this step according to their 

instructions and observed that the sequencing output still presented an unacceptably high 

amount of host DNA contamination (data not shown). After contacting the manufacturer, and 

per their suggestion, this step was optimized by increasing the incubation time to 30 minutes. 

(iii) Regarding the possibility of mismatches between the PNA blockers and the target region of 

chloroplast and mitochondrial templates, it was demonstrated by Lundberg et al. (2013) that 

those targets are conserved among higher plants. We have checked in silico the sequence match 

of pPNA blockers against chloroplast sequences of a distant plant species (Pinus pinaster) and a 

closely related species (Spinacea oleracea) and observed that the match was 100 % in both cases 

(data not shown). As such, we assume that a plant species belonging to the same sub-family 

should not present relevant mismatches in such a conserved region of the chloroplast DNA. We 



230 
 

could not perform the same test for mitochondrial DNA since the database is lacking for this 

organelle’s genome. 

 

The use of mPNA and pPNA blockers in the PCR reaction is described as allowing for a higher yield 

of bacterial DNA amplification when host DNA is present as a competing template for the reaction 

(Lundberg et al., 2013). This was tested in the present work by sequencing a randomly chosen DNA 

extract (sample 11) amplified in the absence and presence of PNA blockers. As a result, a 

remarkable 976-fold increase of bacterial reads was observed (Table 5.3). The addition of PNA 

blockers did not prevent the amplification of the entirety of host DNA templates, as discussed 

above, however it allowed an immensely greater number of bacterial sequences to be analyzed in 

the sample.

PNA blockers.

   Chloroplast 16S rRNA 12826 (79.03 %) 20266 (62.29 %) 

 

Other studies of endophytic bacterial diversity that apply Illumina-based sequencing technology 

usually do not mention which method, if any, was used to avoid host DNA contamination. 

Additionally, when OTUs that show affiliation to host DNA are removed from the sequencing data, 

the percentage of removed reads is often concealed. This lack of information in endophytic diversity 

reports represents a considerable obstacle in accurately comparing our results to those published 

to date. To the best of our knowledge, retaining roughly 22 % of the initial reads in this type of study 

is overall in agreement and/or superior to what is observed in the literature.

Sample analysis: alpha-diversity and rarefaction 

All 30 samples were analyzed for their alpha-diversity metrics, namely Shannon’s diversity, 

Simpson’s dominance (complementary and inverse dominance), Pielou’s evenness, Chao’s 

coverage estimators and richness determination (Table 5.4).  

 

A wide range of values was observed throughout the 30 samples for Shannon’s diversity, richness, 

Pielou’s evenness and Simpson’s indices. For most plant specimens (12 of the 15) Shannon’s 

diversity (H) was higher for BG tissues than for the respective AG tissues. The same pattern was 

observed for 13 of the 15 plant specimens in terms of richness. The highest H value (5.07) was 

observed for a BG sample (sample 16), and the lowest H value (1.32) was observed for an AG sample 

(sample 1). These highest and lowest H values were coincident for the samples with extreme values 

for Pielou’s evenness (samples 16 and 1, respectively).  

 

Rarefaction curves allow an assessment of the sequencing depth for all samples (Figure 5.2a). A 

plateau was observed for most samples, indicating that a good sequencing depth was obtained 

(Figure 5.2b-f). Chao’s coverage estimation values for all samples ranged from 89.76 % to 99.79 % 

(Table 5.4). These results from plateaued rarefaction curves and elevated coverage values indicate 

that the communities for the different samples were well characterized, even in the presence of a 

prominent host DNA contamination in the sequencing output. Available literature on Illumina-

based studies of endophytic bacterial communities shows either lower or comparable values for 

coverage estimation values (60 to 99.3 %; Table 5.5). Other alpha-diversity metrics were not 

compared with other studies since they are inherently highly dependent on the methodology, plant 

species, and other factors. Coverage estimation values were chosen for comparison to have an 

overview of what is achievable with Illumina-based studies of endophytes using samples from 

different tissues and plant species.

The alpha-diversity metrics were then analyzed according to sampling tissue and sampling plot, to 

assess if those were factors that significantly influenced the metrics (Figure 5.3). 

 

 

Figure 5.3 Alpha-diversity metrics results. Values are given for all 30 samples in the scatterplots (black: 

samples 1 to 10, plot 1; grey: samples 11 to 20, plot 2; white: samples 21 to 30, plot 3; triangles: aboveground 

tissues; squares: belowground tissues); and for the three plots (PL1, PL2 and PL3) and two tissues (AG and 

BG) in the boxplots.   



235 
 

Statistical analyses were performed on the alpha-diversity metrics. First, normality was assessed 

for each metric, and was only observed for Shannon’s H (Shapiro-Wilk normality test: W = 0.97476, 

p = 0.6756). Consequently, the tests performed on the values for Shannon’s H followed normality 

assumptions (ANOVA and Student’s t-Test), while tests performed on all other metrics did not 

respect this assumption (Kruskal Wallis and Wilcoxon tests). We then tested if collecting the plants 

from different plots had an effect on the alpha-diversity metrics, and observed that there were no 

significant differences according to sampling plot.  

Finally, we tested if the metrics varied according to the sampling tissue, and observed that there 

were significant differences for Shannon’s H (BG &gt; AG; Student’s t-Test: t = -2.7905, df = 27.481, p 

= 0.009454). Tissue-based differences were also observed in the culture-dependent approach for 

plants collected from the same site (Chapter 3; summary in Table 5.6). This pattern of differences 

in Shannon’s diversity according to sampling tissue, where roots/BG tissues are more diverse than 

leaves/AG tissues, have also been reported in other Illumina-based studies of endophytic bacterial 

communities (Wang et al., 2016a; Xiao et al., 2017).

The analysis of richness also revealed statistical significance according to sampling tissue (BG &gt; AG; 

Wilcoxon Rank Sum test: W = 22, p = 0.0001889). This has also been observed in Illumina-based 

studies of endophytic bacterial communities of Aloe vera (Akinsanya et al., 2015) and soya bean, 

but not for alfalfa (Xiao et al., 2017). Higher richness in BG tissues was not the pattern observed for 

the number of OTUs when the culture-dependent approach was used (Table 3.2). The difference in 

the methodologies used could justify this difference in results, since one of the major disadvantages 

of culture-dependent methods is that only a small fraction of the community is assessed (Amann 

et al., 1995), which, in this case, is likely a result of culture media not providing the necessary 

nutrients for all the bacteria present in a community (Tanaka et al., 2014).  



236 
 

Community analysis: structure 

The structure of the community was analyzed for all 30 samples. As observed above, the samples 

differ in read number (Table 5.2) and sequencing depth (Figure 5.2). When faced with such disparity 

in total read number per sample, some authors rely on sub-sampling of the original OTU table in 

order to obtain a representative OTU table with a minimal common read number for all samples. 

This method, however, results in loss of information and has been highly criticized (McMurdie &amp;amp; 

Holmes, 2014). In the case of the present work, applying this methodology would reduce sample 

sizes to roughly 200 reads per sample, which would exclude 98.47 % of the obtained bacterial reads. 

Since our data is intrinsically prone to loss of information due to host DNA contamination, this 

methodology will not be applied in the present work. As an alternative, the effect that the disparity 

in sample size presents can be reduced by using an adequate distance measure to build a 

resemblance matrix to further study the relationships among the samples (McMurdie &amp;amp; Holmes, 

2013).  

 

The original OTU table was subjected to data transformations in order to understand the effect of 

OTU abundance: (i) a square root transformation (srOTU) to down-weight the high-abundance 

OTUs; (ii) a logarithmic transformation (logOTU, with log10) to enhance the importance given to 

low-abundance OTUs, and to lower the weight of high-abundance OTUs. The boxplots depicted in 

Figure 5.4 show the distribution of total number of reads per OTU for the original OTU table, and 

for the transformed logOTU and srOTU tables.

square root transformed OTU table; logOTU, logarithm (log10) transformed OTU table. 

 



237 
 

The original OTUs and transformed OTUs tables were then used to create resemblance matrices 

using the Bray-Curtis distance measure. Statistical analyses of these matrices revealed that the 

tissue of origin (AG or BG) significantly affected the structure of the community (Adonis: p = 0.001 

for all OTU tables). However, the percentage of variation that this factor represented was relatively 

low (Adonis: R2 = 8.69 %, 13.02 % and 11.97 % for the original, logOTU and srOTU tables, 

respectively). These percentage values indicate that other variables are contributing for the 

majority of the variability observed among the samples (87 to 91 %).  

 

Other factors that could contribute to the observed variability were then analyzed: plant, 

monospecific stand and plot of origin. The community structure was only significantly affected by 

plot of origin, and only when logarithmic or square root transformation was applied to the OTU 

tables (Adonis: p = 0.011 and 0.022 for logOTU and srOTU, respectively). Nevertheless, the 

contribution of this factor was also low (Adonis: R2 = 9.72 % and 9.36 %, respectively) and a high 

percentage of variability was still left unaccounted for (&gt; 77 %). In both cases, the statistically 

different plots were Plot 2 and Plot 3 (Pairwise Adonis: p = 0.012 and 0.036 for logOTU and srOTU, 

respectively). No interaction of factors revealed statistical significance. These results indicate that 

over 77 % of the variability observed is not accounted for by the analyzed factors. This residual 

variability may be due to: 

(i) Physical or chemical factors that were not analyzed in the present work. As discussed before 

(Chapter 3), factors such as soil water content, organic matter content, fine particle content, 

redox potential, pH, and conductivity should be assessed in order to better understand the 

effects of the environment on the community. However, since the fifteen plant samples at study 

were collected from one site, it is not expected that these factors should vary enough to impose 

significant changes. Furthermore, changes in such factors should be reflected by the 

‘monospecific stand’ factor that was analyzed and found to not be significant in explaining the 

observed variability. 

(ii) Methodology-induced variability throughout sample handling steps. To assess if DNA 

extraction of the different samples, PCR amplification, or amplicon sequencing were the source 

of the observed variability, replication should be performed at all the different steps of the 

methodology.  



238 
 

(iii) Bias in OTU formation introduced by read length. The raw reads were quality-filtered 

according to several parameters, such as read length, and reads with less that 150 bp were 

discarded. It is possible that reads that should be grouped into the same taxonomic unit are 

being separated due to a bias introduced by difference in read length. This would introduce 

additional diversity that does not correspond to the reality of the endophytic bacterial 

community. This possible bias could influence the low-abundance OTUs in the sense that not 

many of the OTUs would present a length that is compatible with OTU formation using the 

parameters that were used. In the case that this bias exists, it is wiser to look at the most 

abundant OTUs, even if it counters the aim of doing such an in-depth methodology like Illumina-

based sequencing.  

(iv) Heterogeneity in the community may be a reflection of transitory associations due to 

adaptation of the ever-changing surrounding biotic and abiotic factors (reviewed in 

Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015). 

 

Ordination methods were then performed to assess the existence of patterns according to the 

factors that revealed a significant effect on the community structure: plot and tissue of origin. The 

ordination methods chosen were the rank-based non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS; 

Figure 5.5) and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA; Figure 5.6), and they were performed on the 

original and transformed OTU tables. 

The NMDS representations revealed a sizeable structural variation among the 30 samples, which 

does not appear to be substantially influenced by the OTU table used as input. The NMDS 

representations revealed a clear pattern that separated the samples according to sampling tissue 

across the first axis (MDS1), which is in accordance with the statistical analysis performed above. A 

clear pattern is not observed for plot of origin: Plot 2 and Plot 3 appear to be more distinguishable 

from each other, but both have a coincident distribution with samples from Plot 1. 

The stress values associated to each representation reflect the distortion applied to the 

relationships among samples, which is necessary to display the distances in a bi-dimensional 

environment. The stress values obtained are acceptable (&amp;lt;0.2), and are the lowest when the data 

is transformed by applying square root to the OTU abundance values, and the highest for non-

transformed OTU values.  



239

tissue of origin. PL1, sampling plot 1; PL2, sampling plot 2; PL3, sampling plot 3; AG, aboveground; BG, 

belowground.

origin. PL1, sampling plot 1; PL2, sampling plot 2; PL3, sampling plot 3; AG, aboveground; BG, belowground. 

 

The PCoA representation is in accordance with the NMDS representation for the transformed data 

(logOTU and srOTU). It is noteworthy that, for the transformed data, the separation of the samples 

across the most explicative axis (PCoA1) reflects the factor tissue of origin, and accounts for 14.64 

to 15.28 % of the variability observed among the samples in the bi-dimensional reduced 

environment. Again, this separation is in accordance with what was observed in the statistical 

analyses.  



241 
 

The PCoA representation for the original OTUs, however, tells a different story. The dispersion of 

the samples in the graphic representation is not as marked, especially across the second axis 

(PCoA2). This is not observed in the NMDS method because, since it is a non-metric approach, it 

uses rank-based distances, whilst the PCoA uses absolute distances. These results suggest that the 

high-abundance OTUs (which are down-weighted in the transformed OTU tables) are highly 

influential in determining the distances among the 30 samples. Additionally, no marked differences 

are observed for the different data transformations (logOTU vs srOTU), suggesting that the rare 

OTUs up-weighted in the log10 transformation do not exert relevant influence on the relationships 

among the samples.  

 

The most abundant OTUs influence the distribution of the samples in reduced space 

representations. This was observed when comparing (i) PCoA and NMDS representations for the 

non-transformed OTUs, and (ii) PCoA representations for the original and transformed OTU tables. 

There is statistical congruence showing that samples originated from AG tissues differ from those 

from BG tissues. Although it was not verified in all occurrences, the plot of origin should also be 

taken into account as a factor of OTU variability in the community.  

 

Venn diagrams were then obtained to understand the proportion and abundance of OTUs that were 

exclusive and shared among tissues and plots (Figure 5.7). This is a different approach from the 

reduced space representations (NMDS and PCoA) since the Venn diagram does not take into 

account the distances among samples based on OTU abundance. The Venn diagrams here 

presented are useful to understand the OTU composition of the different levels of the factors tissue 

and plot. Venn diagrams were built including all OTUs (Figure 5.7a-b) and excluding very rare OTUs 

(less than 3 reads; Figure 5.7c-d) to understand their effect among the sampling tissues and plots. 

The Venn diagrams built using all the OTUs found in the community (3593) revealed that the 

majority of the OTUs were found exclusively in BG tissues. This heterogeneity of OTU occurrence is 

in accordance with what was observed in the statistical analysis and also in the reduced space 

representations, where the sampling tissue was a significant factor in accounting for the differences 

among samples. 



242 
 

 

Figure 5.7 Venn diagrams built using OTUs from the endophytic bacterial community. OTUs are grouped 

according to occurrence in sampling tissues (a, c) and plots (b, d). Diagrams a and b were built using all OTUs 

from the community, while diagrams c and d were built using only the OTUs with more than 2 reads. The 

corresponding read numbers and their percentages are also presented. AG, aboveground; BG, belowground.  

 

The Venn diagram for sampling tissue showed that the number of reads exclusive in BG tissues did 

not reflect the OTU richness. In fact, the majority of bacterial reads were observed in the OTUs that 

were shared between AG and BG tissues. This suggests that the majority of the endophytic bacteria 

occurrences are shared among the tissues of the halophyte. As explored in Chapter 3, it is reported 

in the literature that endophytic bacteria colonize the plant through openings in the root system, 

and that these bacteria then colonize the inner tissues of the plant, reaching AG tissues as well 

(reviewed in Lodewyckx et al., 2002). The 516 AG tissue-exclusive OTUs may result from alternative 

entry points into the halophyte, as was also discussed in Chapter 3. 



243 
 

In the Venn diagram for OTU occurrence grouped according to sampling plot (Figure 5.7b), it can 

be observed that the majority of the OTUs (2083) are unique to one of the sampling plots. These 

plot-exclusive OTUs are, however, present in low read numbers and account for 10.16 % of the total 

number of reads. As was the case for the Venn diagram according to tissue (Figure 5.7a), the 

majority of the reads are shared among all the plots (80.05 %).  

 

The results suggest that low-abundance OTUs are enhancing the differences among sampling plots 

or tissues when the data are interpreted in terms of OTUs. This is confirmed by the Venn diagrams 

built excluding very rare OTUs (less than 3 reads; Figure 5.7c-d), where the numbers of OTUs and 

reads in exclusive groups (either sampling plots or tissues) decrease. This decrease is more marked 

in the case of plot-exclusive OTUs, where over 60 % of plot-exclusive OTUs for plots 2 and 3 are 

removed. These very rare OTUs may be responsible for the observed significant differences 

obtained in the statistical analysis that revealed the sampling plot as a significant factor for the OTU 

composition of the community.  

Our earlier statement that the variability observed may be due to the methodology used is also 

supported: since Illumina sequencing allows for an extensive and in-depth analysis of each sample, 

many rare OTUs will be found, and those are likely to differ among different samples, or even 

among different sequencing runs.   



244 
 

Community analysis: overall composition  

The taxonomic attribution of the endophytic bacterial community of H. portulacoides was assessed 

to understand the most relevant bacterial groups in the whole community and in the different 

sampling tissues. Sampling plot was also considered, but was less focused on.  

Figure 5.8 depicts the taxa in the total community at the levels phylum, class, order and family. 

Overall, 37 phyla, 85 classes, 115 orders, 182 families and 232 genera were observed (detailed lists 

are presented in Annex II).  

The dominant phylum observed in the endophytic bacterial community was Proteobacteria (62.5 

% of OTUs; 87 % of reads). Other main phyla included Bacteroidetes (10.7 % of OTUs; 6 % of reads) 

and Planctomycetes (8.8% of OTUs; 2 % of reads). Firmicutes (2.4 % of OTUs; 2 % of reads) and 

Actinobacteria (5.2 % of OTUs; 1 % of reads) were also present. These results are in accordance 

with what was observed in the culturable fraction of the endophytic bacteria of this halophyte 

(Chapter 3), with the exception that the phylum Planctomycetes was not observed in the culture-

based method.  

The phyla of endophytic and other plant-associated bacteria observed in different halophyte 

species are listed in Table 5.7. All phyla observed in the other studies stated in Table 5.7 were also 

detected in the present work. The phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and 

Bacteroidetes appear to be, overall, very frequent in the plant-associated bacterial communities 

among the different halophyte plant species, even in those not closely related to H. portulacoides. 

These four phyla have also been described in association with other plants (Bulgarelli et al., 2013). 

Previous reports of bacteria associated with H. portulacoides also reported the presence of 

Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes (Oliveira et al., 2014a; Oliveira et al., 2014b).  

The phylum Planctomycetes occurs in a considerable percentage in our Illumina-based analysis 

(approximately 9 %), however its detection has not been very frequent among the communities of 

halophytes. It was detected in the rhizosphere of Arthrocnemum macrostachyum by 454-

pyrosequencing (Mora-Ruiz et al., 2016) and in the sediment colonized by Spartina alterniflora in 

the analysis of a clone library (Shuang et al., 2009). Our report is, to the best of our knowledge, the 

first of Planctomycetes as an endophyte of halophytes. Our previous effort of analyzing the 

endophytic community of H. portulacoides using a culture-based approach did not reveal any 

isolate from the phylum Planctomycetes (Chapter 3, Table 5.7).

The absence of Planctomycetes in the culturable fraction could be due to the fact that (i) bacteria 

from this phylum usually present a slow growth rate and can be outgrown by other bacteria that 

have faster growth rates; (ii) inadequacy of the culture media since the successful isolation of these 

bacteria is enhanced by the presence of vitamin solutions, micro- and macronutrients; (iii) a surplus 

of yeast extract or peptone, usually observed in rich culture media, may inhibit their growth (Lage 

&amp;amp; Bondoso, 2011; Lage &amp;amp; Bondoso, 2012). The specific nutritional requirements of this group of 

bacteria may justify their presence in the endosphere of a halophyte. According to Musat et al. 

(2006), Planctomycetes are common in marine sediments that are subjected to tides, which is an 

environment comparable to that of a salt marsh. The ecological role of this phylum is hypothesized 

to be related to providing competition with undesired microorganisms, avoiding dissecation, 

participating in the marine nitrogen cycle by anaerobic ammonium oxidation, and potentially 

producing relevant metabolites (Lage et al., 2011). 

 

The main classes observed in the endophytic community included Alphaproteobacteria (28.8 % of 

OTUs; 33 % of reads), Gammaproteobacteria (28.3 % of OTUs, 53 % of reads), Planctomycetia (7.2 

% of OTUs, 2 % of reads), Flavobacteriia (5.3 % of OTUs, 3 % of reads), Deltaproteobacteria (3.7 % 

of OTUs, 1 % of reads) and Cytophagia (3.1 % of OTUs; 3 % of reads). Both Alpha- and 

Gammaproteobacteria were also found dominant classes when using the culture-based 

methodology applied in this report (Chapter 3). 

The main families in number of OTUs in the bacterial endophytic community (comprising 

approximately 55 % of the OTUs) included Rhodobacteraceae (206 OTUs), Enterobacteriaceae 

(205), Oceanospirillaceae (192), Pirellulaceae (157), Flavobacteriaceae (155), Alteromonadaceae 

(147), Erythrobacteraceae (124), Hyphomicrobiaceae (114), Sphingomonadaceae (100), 

Planctomycetaceae (94), Flammeovirgaceae (74), Pseudomonadaceae (66), Rhizobiaceae (56), 

Verrucomicrobiaceae (51), Rhodospirillaceae (51), Halomonadaceae (48), Piscirickettsiaceae (47), 

and Kiloniellaceae (45). The families with higher number of reads (over 10000) were: 

Oceanospirillaceae (80518 reads), Enterobacteriaceae (47558), Kiloniellaceae (27656), 

Erythrobacteraceae (19438), Pseudomonadaceae (18298), Hyphomicrobiaceae (16712), 

Alteromonadaceae (14134), Piscirickettsiaceae (11587), Saccharospirillaceae (11358), 

Flavobacteriaceae (11164) and Sphingomonadaceae (10205). Several of the families found in the 

present work were also detected in diversity assays in closely related plants (same family; Table 



248 
 

5.8). The families Enterobacteriaceae and Halomonadaceae were frequently found in those studies: 

4 out of 5 analyzed studies.

Twelve of the main families observed here were also observed in the culturable collection: 

Alteromonadaceae (3 isolates), Erythrobacteraceae (78), Flammeovirgaceae (1), Flavobacteriaceae 

(15), Halomonadaceae (100), Hyphomicrobiaceae (22), Oceanospirillaceae (3), Pseudomonadaceae 

(15), Rhizobiaceae (12), Rhodobacteraceae (41), Rhodospirillaceae (6), Saccharospirillaceae (1) and 

Sphingomonadaceae (19). Curiously, the family Dietziaceae, which was present in the culturable 

fraction with 19 isolates, was not detected with the Illumina-based approach.  

Isolates affiliated to the families Erythrobacteraceae, Aerococcaceae, Microbacteriaceae, 

Halomonadaceae and Vibrionaceae tested positive for several enzymatic assays and plant growth 

promotion traits (PGP, Chapter 3). In the Illumina-based approach, these families were found in 

more or less abundant amounts: 19438 reads (124 OTUs) for Erythrobacteraceae, 3399 reads (17 



249 
 

OTUs) for Aerococcaceae, 60 reads (6 OTUs) for Microbacteriaceae, 6947 reads (48 OTUs) for 

Halomonadaceae and 1118 reads (21 OTUs) for Vibrionaceae.  

 

Community analysis: core composition 

The sampling tissue was determined to be a significant factor in the relationships between the 

samples of the endophytic community of H. portulacoides, and those differences were reflected in 

the NMDS and PCoA analyses. The sampling plot was also found to play a role in those relationships 

and, consequently, these two factors are now being analyzed for their influence in the taxonomic 

composition of the endophytic community from H. portulacoides.  

Figure 5.9 shows the distribution of the twenty most read-abundant families across the different 

combinations of sampling plots and tissues. It is clear that there are differences in composition of 

the most dominant families between sampling tissues and sampling plots. A notable difference is 

observed for the combination of both tissues for Plot 2, where a clear dominance of [Tissierellaceae] 

and Enterobacteriaceae families are observed for AG and BG tissues, respectively.  

Upon observation of the original data, it was clear that most of the reads from this family were 

observed in this plot in one single sample (99.5 % for [Tissierellaceae] in sample 11, and 91.4 % for 

Enterobacteriaceae in sample 20). This result contributes to explain why the sampling plot was 

determined to be a significant factor for the differences observed among the samples, since such a 

marked dominance is observed for these particular sets of OTUs.  

 

In the culturable approach, the genera Hoeflea, Labrenzia and Microbacterium were exclusively 

found in BG tissues. With the Illumina-based approach, OTUs attributed to the family 

Phyllobacteriaceae (to which the genus Hoeflea is assigned) were found to either be exclusive to 

BG tissues (16 OTUs, 179 reads) or shared between both tissues (9 OTUs, 1472 reads). In the case 

of the family Hyphomicrobiaceae (to which the genus Labrenzia belongs), tissue-exclusivity was not 

observed, however less OTUs were found to be exclusive to AG tissues (3 OTUs, 19 reads), and more 

exclusive to BG tissues (100 OTUs, 2277 reads) and shared between both tissues (11 OTUs, 14416 

reads). OTUs attributed to the family Microbacteriaceae (to which the genus Microbacterium 

belongs) were observed exclusive to AG tissues (2 OTUs, 16 reads), exclusive to BG tissues (1 OTU, 

2 reads), and shared between both tissues (3 OTUs, 42 reads).

With the Illumina-based sequencing, several families were exclusively associated to one of the 

sampling tissues (15 to AG and 49 to BG tissues). For most of these occurrences, the read number 

was very low, which can justify their exclusiveness.  

The tissue-exclusive OTUs with at least 10 reads were, for AG tissues: Actinomycetaceae (1 OTU, 14 

reads), Carnobacteriaceae (1 OTU, 14 reads), Leptotrichiaceae (1 OTU, 32 reads), 

Porphyromonadaceae (3 OTUs, 139 reads), Prevotellaceae (3 OTUs, 62 reads), Sanguibacteraceae 

(1 OTU, 16 reads) and Veillonellaceae (4 OTUs, 117 reads).  

The BG-exclusive families were: [Balneolaceae] (3 OTUs, 19 reads), [Cerasicoccaceae] (5 OTUs, 162 

reads), [Chthoniobacteraceae] (10 OTUs, 103 reads), Acetobacteraceae (2 OTUs, 31 reads), 

Alcanivoracaceae (3 OTUs, 21 reads), Arctic95B-10 (3 OTUs, 20 reads), Desulfovibrionaceae (4 OTUs, 

33 reads), Francisellaceae (1 OTU, 27 reads), Gemmataceae (3 OTUs, 21 reads), Holosporaceae (1 

OTU, 277 reads), JdFBGBact (1 OTU, 11 reads), koll13 (3 OTUs, 56 reads), Kordiimonadaceae (2 

OTUs, 20 reads), Leptospiraceae (5 OTUs, 28 reads), Methylophilaceae (3 OTUs, 197 reads), 

Nitrospiraceae (1 OTU, 10 reads), Oleiphilaceae (2 OTUs, 12 reads), OM60 (11 OTUs, 396 reads), 

Opitutaceae (9 OTUs, 58 reads), Parachlamydiaceae (2 OTUs, 38 OTUs), Phycisphaeraceae (9 OTUs, 

67 reads), Polyangiaceae (1 OTU, 32 reads), Pseudonocardiaceae (8 OTUs, 259 reads), RB40 (6 

OTUs, 42 reads), Rhodobiaceae (2 OTUs, 17 reads), Sinobacteraceae (5 OTUs, 52 reads), SJA-101 (2 

OTUs, 29 reads) and Trueperaceae (4 OTUs, 13 reads). 

 

To achieve our goal of determining the core endophytome of H. portulacoides, we analyzed the AG 

and BG tissues separately in terms of taxonomic composition, and looked exclusively at the OTUs 

that are shared among all sampled plots, i.e., the core for each tissue of the halophyte. Our 

definition of core microbiome in the present work is the membership core, where the taxa shared 

among all the microbiomes of each plot are considered the core (Shade &amp;amp; Handelsman, 2011). Since 

fifteen samples of each tissue were sampled and are under analysis, the core endophytome further 

discussed should be representative of the population at study (Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015).  

Removing the plot-specific OTUs still conserved approximately 75 % of the total reads obtained in 

the output. This indicates that the obtained core is substantial across the complex endophytic 

community. The core endophytome for each sampling tissue will be discussed below, alongside the 

possible ecological functions associated to those core taxa.  



252 
 

Although function can differ according to bacterial species or even strain (Glick, 2015), it is relevant 

to address the possible ecological functions, since the core endophytome is important for the plant 

holobiont (reviewed in Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015). 

In the AG tissues, the core bacterial endophytome is composed of 104 OTUs, and the core BG 

bacterial endophytome is composed of 299 OTUs. Figure 5.10 shows the distribution of the most 

read-abundant families for the core of each sampling tissue.  

 

The core endophytome of the AG tissues is overwhelmingly dominated by OTUs affiliated to the 

family Oceanospirillaceae (3 Marinomonas OTUs; 72086 reads) that comprises 72 % of the reads in 

the core endophytome for AG tissues. The low number of OTUs and large number of reads 

associated to the family Oceanospirillaceae suggest that well-adapted endophytes are dominant in 

the AG tissues of H. portulacoides. Regarding its possible ecological role in the endosphere, a 

metagenomics approach linked the family Oceanospirillaceae (genus Marinomonas) to functions 

such as the production of B12 vitamin, which is used in metabolism of plants and bacteria (such as 

Planctomycetes, as discussed above), pyruvate synthesis, response to environmental stress and 

detoxification, participation in nitrogen (e.g., ammonium assimilation and glutamine production), 

sulfur, phosphorus and carbohydrate metabolism, and iron uptake (Delmont et al., 2015).  

The genus Marinomonas contains 24 species described thus far, presents worldwide distribution in 

marine environments, and has been isolated from the endosphere of the halophyte Spartina 

maritima (Lucena et al., 2016). Most species from this genus require salt for growth, and some can 

grow in the presence of 15 % salinity (Lucena et al., 2016). Traits observed in the endophytic 

community of Spartina maritima included enzymatic activities (protease, amilase, cellulase and 

lipase) and PGP traits (ACC deaminase activity, IAA and siderophore production, nitrogen fixation 

and phosphate solubilization; Mesa et al., 2015).  

In the culturable fraction from the present work (Chapter 3), isolates belonging to the genus 

Marinomonas presented 2 to 7 enzymatic activities (cellulolytic and xylanolytic present in all), and 

PGP traits such as IAA production, ACC deaminase activity and presence of the nifH gene.

Other families observed in the AG core endophytome included Flammeovirgaceae (2 unassigned 

OTUs; 5652 reads), Enterobacteriaceae (2 OTUs assigned to Erwinia and Klebsiella; 3387 reads), 

Flavobacteriaceae (6 OTUs attributed to Leeuwenhoekiella, Mesonia and Salegentibacter; 3283 

reads), Erythrobacteraceae (11 OTUs attributed to Citromicrobium, Lutibacterium and unassigned 

genera; 1750 reads), Halomonadaceae (7 OTUs assigned to Kushneria and Halomonas; 1594 reads), 

Kiloniellaceae (1 Thalassospira OTU; 1428 reads), Salinisphaeraceae (4 Salinisphaera OTUs; 1379 

reads), Sphingomonadaceae (7 OTUs attributed to Novosphingobium, Sphingomonas and 

unassigned genera; 1336 reads) and Rhodobacteraceae (8 OTUs attributed to Paracoccus, 

Sulfitobacter and unassigned genera; 1332 reads), which overall comprise 21 % of the OTUs from 

the AG core endophytome. 

Isolates obtained from these families in the culturable approach (attributed to the genera 

Leeuwenhoekiella, Mesonia, Citromicrobium, Kushneria, Halomonas, Thalassospira, 

Novosphingobium, Paracoccus and Sulfitobacter) presented up to 6 (one Halomonadaceae isolate) 

enzymatic activities and PGP traits such as phosphate solubilization (only Halomonadaceae), IAA 

production (in all families), siderophore production (Halomonadaceae, Erythrobacteraceae, 

Rhodobacteraceae and Kiloniellaceae), presence of nifH gene (Erythrobacteraceae, 

Halomonadaceae and Rhodobacteraceae) and ACC deaminase activity (Halomonadaceae, 

Erythrobacteraceae, Kiloniellaceae and Rhodobacteraceae).  

 

The core endophytome from the BG tissues was mainly populated by Enterobacteriaceae (3 OTUs, 

attributed to Citrobacter, Erwinia, and an unassigned genus; 35965 reads) and Kiloniellaceae (4 

OTUs, 3 attributed to Thalassospira and one unassigned genus; 25657 reads), comprising 32 % of 

the reads in the BG core endophytome.  

Genera belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae have been widely found in plant-associated 

environments, including the endosphere (Hardoim et al., 2015). In the isolate collection this family 

was represented only by Rahnella spp. isolates, which presented proteolytic, cellulolytic and 

xylanolytic activities, and were able to solubilize phosphate, produce siderophores and IAA in high 

amounts (105.9 µg mL-1), and presented ACC deaminase activity. The family Enterobacteriaceae 

contains many genera capable of promoting the growth of plants and whose strains present 

enzymatic activities and traits that are of interest for direct and indirect promotion of plant growth. 

Literature shows that the most observed traits are siderophore production, IAA production, and 



255 
 

phosphate solubilization. More details are now discussed for some genera of interest, namely 

Citrobacter, Pantoea, Enterobacter and Erwinia.  

Citrobacter, one of the genera to which OTUs were assigned in the Illumina-based sequencing, has 

been associated with production of ammonium and IAA (Thomas &amp;amp; Upreti, 2016), ACC deaminase 

activity, phosphate solubilization, and siderophore production (Gontia-Mishra et al., 2017). In these 

studies, authors also observed that the Citrobacter spp. isolates were able to promote growth of 

different plant species: tomato (Thomas &amp;amp; Upreti, 2016) and wheat (Gontia-Mishra et al., 2017). 

Pantoea was firstly detected as a plant pathogen, but has recently been found to also have a plant 

promotion effect, especially with a newly described species, Pantoea alhagi (Chen et al., 2017). 

Plant growth promotion has been observed in wheat, Arabidopsis thaliana (Chen et al., 2017) and 

tomato (Thomas &amp;amp; Upreti, 2016). Detected traits included the production of ammonium and IAA, 

phosphate solubilization (Thomas &amp;amp; Upreti, 2016), nitrate reduction, siderophore production, 

exopolysaccharides (EPS), and cellulolytic and proteolytic activities.  

Enterobacter, alongside Pantoea, comprise members that present a range of interactions with 

plants from pathogenicity to mutualism (Hardoim et al., 2015). Member of the genus Enterobacter 

have been thoroughly explored for their abilities as a plant growth promoters, and have been found 

to promote growth of different plant species, such as tomato (Thomas &amp;amp; Upreti, 2016), wheat 

(Gontia-Mishra et al., 2017) and coconut seedlings (Gupta et al., 2014). Several traits have been 

associated with the genus Enterobacter, such as production of ammonium and IAA (in some cases 

with high levels; Ribeiro &amp;amp; Cardoso, 2012), phosphate solubilization, nitrogen fixation, siderophore 

production (Thomas &amp;amp; Upreti, 2016; Ribeiro &amp;amp; Cardoso, 2012), ACC deaminase activity, ammonium 

and EPS production, and cellulolytic, proteolytic and lipolytic activities (Gontia-Mishra et al., 2017). 

An analysis of the genomes of Enterobacter strains revealed additional genes of interest for the 

application of plant growth promotion, including genes that allow an enhancement of nutrient 

availability, decrease in pathogenic fungi, resistance to oxidative stress, quorum sensing, 

breakdown of aromatic and toxic compounds and other abiotic stressers. Other genes present in 

the genomes included those related to ACC deaminase activity, IAA and siderophore production, 

phosphate solubilization, H2S production, peroxidases, chitinases and catalases (Gupta et al., 2014). 

Isolates from maize belonging to the genera Enterobacter and Pantoea have been explored for their 

potential as biofertilizers in tropical soils due to their ability to solubilize phosphate (de Abreu et 

al., 2017). 



256 
 

Finally, the genus Erwinia, which was also assigned to our endophytic OTUs in the Illumina-based 

sequencing, has been mainly isolated from plant tissues where it has shown both pathogenic and 

non-pathogenic behavior, depending on the bacterial species. Genome-based evidence showed 

that these differences among species (namely the phytopathogenic E. amylovora and E. pyrifoliae 

and the epiphytic E. tasmaniensis and E. billingiae) are due to recombination events. Additionally, 

the same study suggested that factors such as EPS production, expression of proteases and 

siderophores, and the metabolism of certain carbohydrates contribute to the different observed 

behaviors (Kube et al., 2010). The non-pathogenic species E. billingiae has also been observed to 

present antagonistic behavior in the present of phytopathogenic fungi in Pinus radiata, where it is 

suggested that this Erwinia species can be used as a biocontrol agent (Mesanza et al., 2016). 

Recently, an endophytic isolate from potato has exhibited PGP traits such as phosphate 

solubilization and siderophore production. In vivo tests on potato seedlings confirmed the non-

pathogenic behavior of this Erwinia endophytica isolate (Ramírez-Bahena et al., 2016). The 

specimens of H. portulacoides that were analyzed in the present work did not present symptoms 

of disease, which may suggest that the Erwinia spp. obtained in the Illumina-based sequencing 

belong to non-pathogenic species (Ramírez-Bahena et al., 2016).  

 

For the family Kiloniellaceae, the traits observed in the endophytic collection have been discussed 

above for the genus Thalassospira in the AG core endophytome. In addition to our work, this genus 

has not been characterized regarding its PGP abilities or enzymatic activities. It has, however, been 

highly associated with the capacity to degrade hydrocarbons (e.g., Zhao et al, 2010), which can be 

a useful trait in the setting of a salt marsh subjected to influence of anthropogenic activities. 

 

Other relevant families in the BG core endophytome included Erythrobacteraceae (28 OTUs, 

attributed to Citromicrobium, Lutibacterium, Erythrobacter and unassigned genera; 16314 reads), 

Hyphomicrobiaceae (19 OTUs, attributed to Devosia and unassigned genera; 13959 reads), 

Pseudomonadaceae (3 OTUs, attributed to Pseudomonas and an unassigned genus; 11693 reads), 

Piscirickettsiaceae (5 OTUs, attributed to Methylophaga and unassigned genera; 11071 reads), 

Saccharospirillaceae (1 unassigned OTU; 10813 reads), Sphingomonadaceae (14 OTUs, attributed 

to Novosphingobium, Sphingomonas and unassigned genera; 7447 reads), Cohaesibacteraceae (2 

Cohaesibacter OTUs, 7165 reads), and Rhizobiaceae (7 OTUs, attributed to Agrobacterium and 

unassigned genera; 4730 reads).  



257 
 

Isolates from the family Erythrobacteraceae (assigned to the genera Altererythrobacter, 

Citromicrobium, Erythrobacter and Erythromicrobium) obtained in Chapter 3 were overall positive 

for all tested enzymatic activities and PGP traits. Pseudomonas isolates presented amylolytic, 

proteolytic, lipolytic (all isolates), cellulolytic, xylanolytic and pectinolytic (only at pH 7.0) activities, 

and PGP traits such as phosphate solubilization (7 out of 8 isolates), IAA production (including three 

isolates producing over 100 µg mL-1), and ACC deaminase activity (all isolates). Only one isolate was 

assigned to the Saccharospirillaceae family, which belonged to the genus Saccharospirillum, and 

presented proteolytic and xylanolytic activities, and produced IAA. Isolates belonging to the family 

Sphingomonadaceae were assigned to the genera Novosphingobium, Parasphingopyxis, Stakelama 

and Sphingorabdus, and presented amylolytic, lipolytic, cellulolytic, xylanolytic and pectinolytic 

(only at pH 7.0) activities, and PGP traits such as phosphate solubilization (one Stakelama isolate), 

IAA production (all isolates), siderophore production, ACC deaminase activity and presence of the 

nifH gene. Cohaeasibacter isolates presented amylolytic, lipolytic and cellulolytic activities, and 

were able to solubilize phosphate, produce IAA, present ACC deaminase activity, and the nifH gene 

was present. Finally, isolates from the family Rhizobiaceae included the genera Ensifer and 

Rhizobium, which presented amylolytic, proteolytic and pectinolytic activities (only Ensifer isolates), 

and lipolytic, cellulolytic and xylanolytic activities. PGP activities for this family included phosphate 

solubilization, siderophore and IAA production (one Ensifer isolate producing over 100 µg mL-1), 

ACC deaminase activity and presence of the nifH gene.  

In the culture-dependent methodology, no isolates were obtained from the families 

Hyphomicrobiaceae and Piscirickettsiaceae (Chapter 3). Members of the genus Devosia (family 

Hyphomicrobiaceae) have been isolated from plants from root nodules, are able to perform nitrate 

and nitrite reduction, and the genes for nodulation protein D and nifH have been detected, which 

are required for nodulation and symbiotic nitrogen fixation (Rivas et al., 2003). The genus 

Methylophaga (family Piscirickettsiaceae) has been associated with PGP traits such as IAA and 

ammonium production and ACC deaminase activity (Bal et al., 2013). 

 

Interestingly, the AG core predominant family Halomonadaceae was not observed in the BG core, 

and the BG core families Hyphomicrobiaceae, Saccharospirillaceae and Cohaesibacteraceae were 

not observed in the AG core.

Does a rose, by any other name, smell just as sweet? 

The ever-growing application of high-throughput sequencing has triggered the need for automated 

bioinformatics tools that allow for the analysis of an extremely large amount of information in a 

small number of steps and in relatively little time. Two pipelines have dominated the field of 

bacterial 16S rRNA gene analysis obtained from high-throughput sequencing techniques: Mothur 

(Schloss et al., 2009) and QIIME (Caporaso et al., 2010). The latter was used in the present work, as 

is detailed in the Methods section of the present Chapter. There, it is also stated that the 

Greengenes database was used as the reference to obtain taxonomic affiliation of the OTUs that 

resulted from Illumina-based sequencing. Despite its outdated nature (last updated in 2013), this 

database is the default for the taxonomy attribution in the QIIME pipeline, and, for this reason, is 

commonly used when running the QIIME pipeline. The widespread use of the same database is 

beneficial in the sense that it allows for an easier and more reliable comparison of results, however, 

some attention should be given to the output it creates. 

 

In the present work, one of our goals was to compare the diversity observed in the culture-based 

approach in Chapter 3 with the most abundant groups observed in a high-throughput sequencing 

approach. In doing so, several inaccuracies were observed in the attributions of the taxa names for 

several different OTUs, and in different taxonomic levels.  

The taxonomic attribution of the lowest taxonomic level obtained from the Greengenes output was 

manually compared against the databases/platforms: LPSN (Euzéby, 1997), EzTaxon (Yoon et al., 

2016), and SILVA (Quast et al., 2013). Overall, Greengenes attributed at least one inaccurate taxa 

level for approximately 20 % of our OTUs. Roughly half of these occurrences (393 OTUs) differ from 

what is consistently stated by the other databases -- e.g., in Greengenes, the genus 

Marinilactibacillus is attributed to the family Aerococcaceae, while the other databases file it under 

the family Carnobacteriaceae. In 315 OTUs the Greengenes attribution was also not consistent 

among the other databases -- e.g., the family Mycobacteriaceae is affiliated to the order 

Actinomycetales in the Greengenes and LPSN database, while it is under the order 

Corynebacteriales in the EzTaxon and SILVA databases. In the specific case of the genus 

Anaerospora (10 OTUs in our data), the misattribution occurred at all taxonomic levels (family, 

order, class and phylum) for this Firmicutes-affiliated genus that the Greengenes database had 

attributed to Proteobacteria. 



259 
 

Affiliation misattributions may have occurred for two main reasons: (i) in the four years since the 

Greengenes database was last updated, there may have been changes in taxa names -- e.g., species 

from the genus Agrobacterium (32 OTUs in our data) have been transferred to other genera, 

according to LPSN, SILVA and the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes 

(www.the-icsp.org), and this genus no longer exists in the EzTaxon database; (ii) erroneous taxa 

names were introduced in the Greengenes database upon its construction, and have yet to be 

corrected. Alternatives to the Greengenes database should be sought after and applied, in order to 

have an updated and accurate record of taxonomic affiliations, nonetheless keeping in mind that 

no database appears to be exhaustively correct. The Society for General Microbiology 

(www.microbiologyonline.org.uk) advocates for LPSN to find the correct name of a given bacterium, 

however this platform -- and/or its taxonomy browser -- is not wholly updated on a regular basis. 

Regardless of the used database, the output generated by these pipelines in terms of taxonomic 

affiliations should be critically examined before being discussed in publications.  



260 
 

Conclusions 

A considerably diverse community of bacteria resides in the inner tissues of H. portulacoides. Here, 

we observed a total of 3593 bacterial OTUs that comprised five main phyla and several minor ones, 

85 classes, 182 families and 232 genera. We have determined the core bacterial endophytome of 

the halophyte using high-throughput sequencing and thorough analysis with high replication, and 

the results obtained evidence significant differences in the core endophytome in the AG and BG 

tissues.  

Analysis of sequence similarity allowed us to identify several families in the core endophytome of 

AG and BG tissues in the present work. Previous works, including our isolation effort in Chapter 3, 

have exposed members of those families as pertaining several enzymatic activities and PGP traits, 

suggesting a significant ecological role for the diversity that is consistent in the halophyte.  

The results obtained can be used to, not only comprehend the existing community, but also as a 

possible basis to predict effects of a disturbance, such as the presence of metals. The integrated 

knowledge obtained from trait analysis in the culture-dependent approach and the information 

retrieved from the culture-independent approach should be taken into account when considering 

the design of a bacterial consortium to apply in a PGP and/or phytoremediation setting.

Final considerations 

Considerations regarding metal(loid) contamination in Ria de Aveiro 

The contamination observed in Ria de Aveiro, especially in the Laranjo Bay, has been a subject of 

study for decades, and will likely be so for many years to come. The optimistic prediction of Pereira 

et al. (1998a) that the Hg levels in the basin would return to background values in 20 years is clearly 

not a reality. Nearly 20 years since the publication, contamination is still observed, as is the gradient 

of contaminants from the effluent discharge site to other sites of the basin.  

It was also observed that the halophyte Halimione portulacoides is able to accumulate several 

metals in its tissues, mainly in the BG tissues. Endophytic isolates from contaminated and non-

contaminated sites revealed PGP activity in several in vitro assays, and Pseudomonas spp. isolates 

from contaminated sites showed ability to promote in vivo growth of the model plant Arabidopsis 

thaliana. This evidences the role that endophytic bacteria play in the endosphere of plants that 

intervene in accumulation of contaminants and in the phytoremediation of contaminated soils. This 

role has also been recently observed in other plants regarding metal contamination (e.g., Pan et al., 

2017).

Considerations on the description of novel bacterial species 

Taxonomy and the description of new taxa have a reputation of being composed of strict rules. 

During the description of ten novel species from five different genera in the present work, it was 

observed that this statement is both true and untrue. On the one hand, classes of tests are required 

for the description of novel taxa, such as genomic sequence-based tests (e.g., 16S rRNA gene 

sequence), biochemical and phenotypical tests. In the case of specific taxa, e.g. those to be included 

in the family Halomonadaceae, an extensive list of tests exists for each class of tests. This is what 

makes the initial statement true: rules are in place so that researchers are required to perform a 

certain number and type of tests. On the other hand, the way these tests are performed is not as 

strict. A number of different methods may be used to assess, for example, the range and optima 

for temperature, pH and salt requirements: tests may be performed on liquid or solid media, the 

exact points of temperature/pH/salt to test are chosen by the researchers, as is the duration and 

several other aspects of the assays. To make matters worse, details of the conditions that the 

researchers use in their experiments are rarely described in the published papers. This makes 

comparison of such a simple test -- assessing range and optima of growth conditions -- a highly 

subjective matter. This subjectivity, however, is not common to all tests since, for some biochemical 

tests, researchers are required to assay their putative novel species, and closely related reference 

type strains in parallel, in the same conditions. Nevertheless, parallel testing is not a requirement 

for all biochemical and phenotypic tests. This drawback could begin to be surpassed if it was 

required of the researchers to describe all methodology in detail, since it is an essential part (if not 

the essential part) of strain comparison for taxa description purposes in the case of tests that are 

not required to be ran in parallel for novel and reference strains.  

 

The genomic sequence-based criteria for strain comparison with the aim of species delineation 

have been chiefly based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence. However, since the sequence of this gene 

does not efficiently discriminate closely related species (de la Haba et al., 2010), its use for studying 

some taxa was deemed insufficient. In those cases, the information given by the 16S rRNA gene has 

been complemented with other genomic sequence-based approaches to aid in bacterial species 

delineation. Such approaches include the concatenation of sequences of a number of housekeeping 

genes that act as molecular clocks, as was performed for the description of novel taxa of 

Microbacterium and Salinicola in Chapter 4. Consequently, this MLSA approach uses more 

information, in terms of number of nucleotides, than the 16S rRNA gene sequence approach. As 



285 
 

bacterial genome sequencing becomes a reality for a larger number of research groups, the number 

of nucleotides that may be used for strain comparison is vastly greater. Genome comparison ought 

to be the next obvious step as input for strain comparison and to help delineate bacterial species. 

Accordingly, bioinformatics tools that allow for this comparison have been developed and 

optimized, to the point where even as little as 20 to 25 % of the genome of a strain is estimated to 

suffice in giving a stable result to be used as sequence-based criteria in species delineation (Richter 

&amp;amp; Rosselló-Móra, 2009).  

The whole genome sequencing era should make it possible to have enough information that gives 

a highly reliable answer to, at least, which genus a strain belongs to. This determination could give 

way for other methods to be considered obsolete for these genus confirmation assays, such as 

listing polar lipids, fatty acids or determining dominant ubiquinones. Undeniably, these traits 

should be defined for a genus, for example at the moment of genus description. But perhaps their 

determination in the description of subsequent species could be considered redundant in 

determining something that is easily known with sufficient genome-based information. 

Additionally, common characteristics determined in wet lab context such as determination of G+C 

content and performing DNA-DNA hybridization ought to be replaced with in silico determination 

of these traits. These in silico determinations have relevant advantages when compared to their 

wet lab counterparts, namely (i) no need to use a specialized laboratory to perform the method, (ii) 

no need for sensitive and error prone methodologies, and (iii) the ability to build an additive 

database (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2013). 

 

The ever-changing sciences of taxonomy and systematics face new challenges with the advances in 

and greater availability of genome sequencing. These challenges should be met with 

comprehensive discussion so as to enhance the process of description of novel taxa and get as much 

information as possible from genome-based methods. It is of imperative importance to take these 

new techniques into account as soon as possible, since over 750 novel species of bacteria were 

published in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology in 2016 alone.

Final considerations on studies on endophytic bacteria 

As discussed in Chapters 3 and 5, culturable bacteria usually represent only a small fraction of the 

bacteria present in a community. In the present work, the efforts applied to isolate endophytic 

bacteria from H. portulacoides yielded a considerable number of isolates, when compared to similar 

types of studies in the literature. This may have been the result of using three different culture 

media to isolate bacteria, as it allowed coverage of nutritional needs of oligotrophs, of bacteria that 

require high salt contents, and of bacteria that grow in regular nutritive media. Amplicon-based 

culture-independent methods used to study communities present advantages in comparison to 

culture-dependent methods, especially when the depth of the information obtained is considered. 

Nevertheless, it is still highly relevant to study the culturable fraction. An assessment of the 

response of a community exposed to contaminants can be performed by analysing the culturable 

fraction from contaminated and non-contaminated samples, as discussed in Chapter 3. 

Additionally, having a collection of isolates allowed for a deeper characterization of a vast selection 

of traits, which is not yet achievable with the current tools in a culture-independent approach.  

High-throughput sequencing allowed the detection of an additional dominant phylum that had not 

been observed in the culturable methodology. In this sense, the present work contributed to 

further show that culture-based methods do not suffice to have a comprehensive understanding of 

a bacterial community, even when multiple nutritional needs are considered in the culture media 

used.  

There are obstacles in the analysis of endophytic bacterial communities using culture-independent 

methods. Primarily, the interference of host DNA in PCR amplification when using universal primers 

that target the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence. The majority of methods available to avoid this 

interference are based on processes that also induce loss of information of the bacterial fraction. 

The PNA blocker approach appears to be adequate in the sense that, in theory, there is no loss of 

information in the process of obtaining the community DNA sample, nor in the PCR amplification. 

In our case, using the PNA blockers allowed for an in-depth analysis of the diversity, in spite of a 

marked host DNA presence. This approach allowed us to carry out Illumina-based sequencing to 

accomplish our aim of performing a deep and extensive characterization of the bacterial diversity 

in the endosphere of H. portulacoides.

Discussion of main and specific goals 

The present work accomplished its main goal of characterizing the endophytic bacterial community 

of the salt marsh halophyte H. portulacoides.  

Regarding the specific goals listed in Chapter 2, these were also achieved: in Chapter 3, a 

comprehensive collection of 665 endophytic isolates was obtained from three sites with different 

levels of metal(loid) contamination. This collection was subjected to PCR-fingerprinting, yielding 

467 distinct strains, which were then explored for their taxonomy and relevant characteristics such 

as production of enzymes and presence of plant growth promotion (PGP) traits. Promising isolates 

for PGP were detected and further studied for their in vivo abilities in a model plant, specifically 

those belonging to the genus Pseudomonas. The endophytic bacteria collection was also explored 

for the presence of undescribed taxa and, in Chapter 4, ten novel bacterial species are described in 

detail according to taxa-specific regulations. Finally, the diversity of endophytic bacteria residing in 

healthy specimens of H. portulacoides was extensively explored by combining knowledge from 

culture-dependent (Chapter 3) and -independent methods (Chapter 5).  

 

 

  



288 
 

Considerations regarding the proposed hypotheses 

Four hypotheses were proposed in Chapter 2 and explored throughout the work.  

The first hypothesis stated that the endosphere of the halophyte H. portulacoides is a hotspot for 

bacterial diversity, and this was in fact observed throughout the work. In Chapter 3, culture-based 

methodologies were applied to obtain a large collection of endophytic bacteria, and these efforts 

revealed that the culturable endosphere of H. portulacoides comprised four phyla, seven classes, 

fourty families and seventy nine genera. Culture-independent methods used in Chapter 5 

attempted at a deeper analysis of the diversity and allowed identification of 37 phyla, 85 classes, 

182 families and 232 genera. Considering these numbers, the results supported the first hypothesis.  

The second hypothesis stated that the presence of metal(loid)s influences the structure and 

diversity of the endophytic bacteria of H. portulacoides. This hypothesis was only tested for the 

culturable fraction of the endophytic bacteria of the halophyte, and it was indeed observed that 

the structure and diversity was significantly different in samples collected from metal(loid) 

contaminated and non-contaminated sites.  

The third hypothesis stated that the endophytic bacterial community of the halophyte includes 

bacteria that have potential for promoting plant growth. This was observed in Chapter 3 where 

several isolates obtained in the culturable fraction presented one or more PGP traits, and where 

Pseudomonas spp. isolates also exhibited antagonistic properties against known pathogens, and 

the ability to induce in vivo plant elongation.  

The fourth hypothesis stated that the endophytic bacterial community of the halophyte includes a 

plethora of novel bacteria taxa. Information based on partial sequences of the 16S rRNA gene of 

representative strains in the endophytic bacteria collection revealed 29 putative novel species, 7 of 

which represented putative novel genera. From these, ten novel species were described (Chapter 

4) and are now (or will be soon) members of the known diversity in the domain Bacteria.  

  



289 
 

Conclusions 

The endosphere of the halophyte Halimione portulacoides is a hotspot for bacterial diversity which 

differs according to the presence of metal(loid)s in the sediment, and should be further explored 

for their potential to aid in phytoremediation. The analysis of this unexplored microbial hotspot 

also revealed a plethora of undescribed diversity, exposing a promising reservoir of new bacterial 

taxa.  

 

 

Future work 

In the present work several of the obtained endophytic isolates exhibited an enormous potential 

for promoting plant growth. In Chapter 3, Pseudomonas spp. isolates were further analyzed for 

their PGP potential and in vitro experiments revealed the ability of the most promising isolates to 

promote growth of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Future work should be performed in a 

similar manner with other promising isolates, so as to assess their ability to participate in tasks such 

as (i) promote growth of different plants, including those used in phytoremediation processes; (ii) 

increase tolerance to contaminants, especially for those isolates obtained from metal(loid) 

contaminated sites; (iii) increase tolerance to salt, since the isolates were collected from a salt-

tolerant plant.  

Several strains in the endophytic collection belonged to novel bacterial species. Ten novel species 

are described in the present work, however, many more remain obscured from the known bacterial 

diversity. Future work should be performed in order to unveil this diversity, and, during such an 

endeavor, the techniques used should include those which allow for cumulative knowledge to 

complement databases, such as genome sequencing, as discussed in Chapter 4 and in the present 

Chapter. 

Finally, future work should include a culture-independent approach to analyze the bacterial 

endophytome from H. portulacoides sampled from sites with intermediate and high metal(loid) 

contamination. This would allow for a deeper analysis of such an endophytome and also allow for 

comparison with the results obtained in Chapter 5, potentially revealing a highly adapted 

community in a contaminated environment.
