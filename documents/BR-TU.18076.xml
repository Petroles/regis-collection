ABSTRACT

Trials were carried out in Paraúna, Goiás, Brazil,
to evaluate the impact of whitefly on soybean yield. The
experimen tal design was a randomized block, with four
treatments and four replications (10m x 20m). The treatments
were different levels of infestation, managed by applying
insecticide at different timing; the control was kept free of insects
by weekly insecticide spraying. The number of insects per leaflet
was evaluated weekly, and at harvest the yield (kg ha-1) and the
weight of 100 seeds (g) were recorded. The soybean was tolerant
to whitefly, since only the treatment where nymphs per leaflet
reached 136.31±26.60 (treatment without the use of insecticides)
was sufficiently severe to cause yield loss. This loss was likely
associated with the sooty mold, caused by the fungus Capnodium
sp. that develops in the sugary secretion produced by the whitefly
on the surface of plant leaves. Therefore, insecticides should
only be sprayed when a whitefly infestation is sufficiently severe
to trigger the growth of sooty mold. The relationship between
insect number per leaf and the growth of sooty mold still needs
to be determined for different soybean cultivars, as well as for
different environmental conditions.

RESUMO

Experimentos foram conduzidos em Paraúna,
Goiás, Brasil, avaliando o impacto da mosca-branca na
produção de soja. O delineamento experimental foi em blocos
ao acaso, com quatro tratamentos e quatro repetições (10m x
20m). Os tratamentos foram diferentes níveis de infestação,

obtidos pela aplicação de inseticidas em diferentes momentos;
a testemunha foi mantida livre do ataque da praga, aplicando-
se inseticida semanalmente. O número de insetos por folíolo
foi avaliado semanalmente e, na colheita, foi avaliada a
produtividade (kg ha-1) e o peso de 100 sementes (g). A soja foi
tolerante à mosca-branca, visto que apenas o tratamento em
que as ninfas por folíolo atingiram a média de 136,31±26,60
(tratamento sem aplicação de inseticidas) foi severo o suficiente
pa ra c ausa r pe rdas de prod uti vida de. Essa  perda f oi
provavelmente associada à formação de fumagina, causada
pelo fungo Capnodium sp., que se desenvolve nas secreções
açucaradas produzidas pela mosca-branca na superfície das
folhas. Portanto, inseticidas precisam apenas ser aplicados
quando a infestação de mosca-branca for severa o suficiente
para propiciar a formação de fumagina. Entretanto, a relação
entre o número de insetos por folíolo e a formação de fumagina
ainda precisa ser determinada para diferentes cultivares, assim
como para diferentes condições ambientais.

INTRODUCTION

The whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius)
(Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is a polyphagous pest of
agricultur al impor tance throughout the wor ld
(PRABHAKER et al., 2005), mainly in tropical and
subtropical regions (NAUEN &amp;amp; DEHOLM, 2005). This
pest was formerly of secondary importance for soybean

crops, but in recent years in some countries, this species
has become a key-pest, reducing yields and increasing
costs due to the insecticides used for its control
(VIEIRA et al., 2011) without an established Economic
Threshold (ET). Therefore, the increase insecticide use
and its consequently increase in soybean production
costs due to B. tabaci infestations is mainly a
consequence of this lack of awareness of the number
of pests that justifies its control (ET). This had led
soybean growers to apply insecticides indiscriminately.
Excessive use of insecticides has only worsened the
problem with the pest, since it favors the selection of
resistant insects to the chemicals used, making the
so ybean pr oduction system unsustainab le
(PALUMBO et al., 2001).

T hus, within the context of Soybean
Integrated Pest Management (Soybean IPM), which is
based on the use of a control method, only when
necessary, it is important to consider ET. The ET is
defined as the number of pests that justifies the use of
a control to prevent the pest population from increasing
to the Economic Injury Level (EIL) where profits lost
occurs (STERN et al., 1959). Consequently, the
establishment of the ET is crucial to chemical control
(PEDIGO &amp;amp; HIGLEY, 1996). However, to determine the
ET, it is necessary to quantify the damage caused by
the pest and the population density that will cause
yield reduction (ELLSWORTH &amp;amp; MARTINEZ
CARRILLO, 2001). In the case of B. tabaci, this is a
great challenge, due to certain distinctive characteristics
of the insect. Among these characteristics are its feeding
mode (phloem sucking), its small size, and its capacity
to transmit diseases (ELLSWORTH &amp;amp; MARTINEZ-
CARRILLO, 2001). As a consequence, there is a lack of
studies correlating whitefly infestations with soybean
yield. Therefore, this study evaluated the impact of
different intensities of infestations of B. tabaci on
soybean yield, in order to establish the most appropriate
timing for insecticide use.

MATERIAL   AND   METHODS

Two field trials were carried out in Paraúna,
State of Goiás in central Brazil, during the years of 2008
and 2009, with different intensities of whitefly
infestation. One sample of insects was collected at the
first day of the trials and was identified by PCR-RAPD
of genomic DNA as B. tabaci biotype B.

Goiás State is one of the most important
regions of soybean cropping in Brazil, the second
largest producer worldwide. Soybean cultivar ‘P98R31’
(maturity group 8.3 and indeterminate growth habit)
was sown at the density of 11.5 seeds/linear meter in

the first trial (trial 1), which was conducted under lower
pest infestation pressure (where even on untreated
plots the number of nymph per leaflet was not superior
to 47.05) compared to trial 2. The same cultivar and the
same sowing density were used in a second trial (trial
2), carried out in an area with higher infestation pressure
(where on untreated plots the number of nymph per
leaflet was 136.31). The row spacing used was 0.5m
between rows, and the trial sites were irrigated via
central pivot. Fungicides and herbicides were applied
equally in all trials, according to the cultural practices
commonly adopted by local growers (one post-
emergence application of herbicide, glyphosate, 3
weeks after plant emergence, and three applications of
fungicides, tebuconazol + trifloxystrobin, during the
soybean reproductive stage).

The experimental design was a randomized
block, with four treatments and four replications. Each
plot was 10m wide and 20m long. Since trials were carried
out in a field with natural infestation, the choices of the
treatment were made accordingly to the natural occurrence
of the insect and also taking into consideration that
growers usually apply insecticide when 10 nymphs are
found per leaflet. Thus, the treatments evaluated varied
between both trials (Table 1) but were always two
spraying timing; a control plot that was kept free of
insects by weekly applications of insecticide
[piriproxifen, 25g of active ingredient (a.i) ha-1], and an
infested control treatment without any insecticide
spraying. In the area of the first experiment, a lower
infestation of whitefly occurred (where even on
untreated plots the number of nymph per leaflet was
not superior to 47.05), and for that reason the
applications of insecticides were performed when the
population of B. tabaci reached 10 or 40 nymphs per
leaflet. In the second experiment, due to the higher
population of the pest (where on untreated plots the
number of nymph per leaflet was 136.31), the
insecticides were applied when the population reached
60 or 120 nymphs per leaflet (Figures 1A and 1B).

The whitefly infestation level in each plot was
evaluated weekly, by counting the number of B. tabaci
nymphs present on 14 leaflets randomly collected from
the middle third of the plants, located in the center of each
experimental plot. At the end of the season, the average
B. tabaci from the whole season for each treatment could
also be evaluated. Additionally a visual percentage of
leaf canopy coverage by the sooty mold fungus caused
by Capnodium sp. was recorded also on a weekly basis.
At the end of the crop cycle, the soybeans were harvested
separately for each treatment, evaluating productivity (kg
ha-1) and the weight of 100 seeds (g) (corrected to 13%

seed moisture). The results were subjected to exploratory
analyses to evaluate the assumption of normality of
residues, homogeneity of variance of treatments, and
additivity of the model, to allow for the ANOVA and
the multiple comparisons of means by the Tukey test
(P       0.05) (SAS INSTITUTE, 2001).

RESULTS

In trial 1, carried out under lower pest
infestation (Figure 1A), there was no statistically
significant difference in yield among the different levels
of B. tabaci infestation (Table 1). In this experiment,
the highest numbers of B. tabaci occurred at the
soybean R3 reproductive stage, and in the treatment
without application of insecticide, the number of
nymphs/leaflet reached 47.05±6.03, which was
statistically similar to the treatment with spraying at 40
nymphs per leaflet (Figure 1A). The pest infestation
decreased naturally from stage R3 to R6, even in the
treatment where no insecticide was applied and at R6
stage there was no statistical differences among the
treatments (Figure 1A) resulting in no yield difference
among treatments (Table 1). Similarly to the results for
yield (kg ha-1), the weight of 100 seeds (g) was also
statistically equal among the treatments (Table 1).

In trial 2, whitefly pressure was higher
(Figure 1B) than in the first trial (Figure 1A). The

number of B. tabaci nymphs per leaflet reached
136.31±26.60 in the treatment without insecticide at the
R2 reproductive stage, statistically similar to treatment
of spray with 120 nymphs per leaflet (Figure 1B).
Similarly to what occurred in trial 1, the pest population
decreased naturally in the second trial, to a population
of 15 nymphs per leaflet at the R6 reproductive stage
(Figures 1A and 1B) even though the pest outbreak at
the treatment without insecticide kept always higher
than the other treatments (Figure 1B).

Despite the higher infestation of B. tabaci
in the second experiment (Figure 1B), the yield differed
statistically only between the treatments with weekly
application of insecticides and the treatment with no
insecticide application (Table 1). In spite of this
significant difference in productivity, no differences in
the weight of 100 seeds were recorded (Table 1). Notably,
there were no statistical differences among the treatment
with weekly application of insecticides and the
treatments with insecticide application only when the
population of the pest reached 60 nymphs per leaflet,
or the treatment when the insecticide was sprayed when
the population reached 120 nymphs per leaflet (Table
1). Nevertheless, it is important to point out the growth
of sooty mold, covering close to 100% of the surface
of bottom leaves, only occurred in the treatment without
application of insecticides in the second trial, when
the whitefly population was higher.

DISCUSSION

In addition to direct injuries caused by
feeding, B. tabaci can also transmit viruses (carlavirus,
closterovirus, geminivirus, luteovirus and potyvirus,
among others) in several different crops including
soybeans (MORALES &amp;amp; ANDERSON, 2001). On
soybean plants, the whitefly is the vector of a virus of
the carlavirus group responsible for the disease called
soybean stem necrosis. Soybean plants infected with

this virus display necrosed stems, which as the
symptoms progress may kill the entire plant. This
disease was not observed in either trial in this study,
most probably because the soybean cultivar ‘P98R31’
is resistant to the virus. In this context, since soybean
cultivars with resistance to ‘soybean stem necrosis’
are already available; growers can manage this problem
by sowing resistant cultivars. This strategy was
followed in this study, which focused on evaluating
direct damage caused by whitefly feeding.

251Different timing of whitefly control and soybean yield.

Ciência Rural, v.43, n.2, fev, 2013.

In both trials, only whitefly infestation that
reached 136.31 nymphs per leaflet (Figure 1B) was
sufficiently severe to cause significant yield losses
(Table 1). However, it is important to take into
consideration that absence of damage might be a
cultivar feature that differs among different soybean
cultivars (VIEIRA et al., 2011). For example, LAMBERT
et al. (1995, 1997) observed significant differences in
soybean varietal response to whitefly population
densities and antixenosis resistance response for the
Perrin, Cook, and N88-91 soybean genotypes, compared
to the susceptible varieties Braxton and Cobb in field
conditions. Therefore, it is important, in future
researches, to test other different cultivars with various
whitefly infestation intensities, in order to gather this
information for as many soybean cultivars as possible.

Among the injuries caused by B. tabaci,
when the insect occurs in large populations, are the
plants weakened by the extraction of large amounts of
sap. This induces early defoliation and impacts the
soybean plant development and yield, as observed in
some soybean fields under attack of this pest (VIEIRA
et al., 2011). Another problem is that B. tabaci can
cause chlorosis in the leaves of attacked plants,
reducing photosynthesis (LIN et al., 1999). However,
the number of B. tabaci on the soybean plants that
triggers these types of damage is not yet well
established. Similarly, there is no clear distinction
between the direct effects of the injuries caused by the
insect and the indirect effects caused by the growth of
sooty mold on the leaves.

 The growth of sooty mold on the plant
leaves is an indirect consequence of whitefly feeding,
since the insect excretes honeydew, a sweet and sticky
substance produced in response to excessive feeding
on plant sap. When exposed to sunlight, honeydew
supports the growth of Capnodium sp., a black fungus
called sooty mold, on the leaf surface. Generally, the
presence of sooty mold increases the temperature of
the leaves and literally “burns” the plant by solar
radiation. Sooty mold can also block solar radiation,
thus reducing the photosynthesis rate of the leaves
(OLIVEIRA et al., 2001). In the present study, sooty
mold was detected only on the control treatment of the
experiment conducted in the area with higher infestation
of the pest (Figure 1B). At R4 stage sooty mold appeared
covering 20% of the total leaf surface of all leaves of
bottom plant canopy. From R5 to R6, the fungus
increased covering 30% of the total leaf surface of all
leaves of bottom and medium plant canopy and this is
probably directly associated with the reduction of
productivity observed in that specific treatment (Table
1) since in all the other treatments no sooty mold was

observed. After R6 leaves started senescence and sooty
mold did not covered more than 30% of leaf surface. It
is important to point out that the Capnodium sp.
growing might differ among different plants and
climatic conditions. AZEVEDO &amp;amp; BLEICHER (2002)
observed sooty mold growing on melon crops when
only 4 to 8 whitefly adults per 2.8cm2 of foliar area was
recorded, number that was then considered ET to start
insecticide spraying at that crop. At cotton, only 2.08
whiteflies per leaf were responsible for 30.84% of yield
loss (ALENCAR et al., 2002). Differently, JEON et al.
(2009) observed a higher tolerance on cucumber plants
when fruit damage only occurred from 63 days after
Trialeurodes vaporariorum infestation. This indicates
a great variability of plant response to whitefly injury.
Therefore, new trials with different soybean cultivars
and climatic conditions are also important since this
kind of variation in the results might also occur among
different soybean cultivars and areas where the crop is
cultivated. Nevertheless, our data are the first report
on soybean response to whitefly attack and can be
taken as a primary result for future researches.

Moreover, B. tabaci probably can also
reduce leaf photosynthesis by altering this
physiological process in response to its feeding,
ind ependently o f the gr owth of sooty mo ld
(PETERSON &amp;amp; HIGLEY, 1993). Establishing these
alterations is an important step in further understanding
plant-whitefly interaction. BUENO et al. (2005) reported
that 79 B. tabaci adults per soybean plant, at the V2
development stage, were not sufficient to reduce plant
photosynthetic capacity. The population size of B.
tabaci capable of initiating photosynthetic reduction
on soybean plants is still unknown, and is one of the
challenges for future research in this area.

The determination of the precise relationship
between the infestation of a given pest and the
consequent loss in crop productivity is the first step in
establishing the ET to be used in taking the decision to
implement a control method. In this study, the lack of
reduction in productivity observed in most of the
treatments may also be associated with the natural
reduction of the B. tabaci population that occurred
along the crop cycle. In addition, the chemical control
used to reduce the pest population was highly efficient.
In the treatments with insecticide sprays (40 to 120
nymphs leaflet-1), only a single application was enough
to maintain the infestations below these pre-established
levels for the experiments, until harvest (Figures 1A
and 1B).

The insecticide used, piriproxifen, is a growth
regulator, a juvenoide that acts by impairing the normal
balance of hormones, resulting in the suppression of

embryogenesis, metamorphosis, and the formation of
the adult insect (DHADIALLA et al., 1998). The
efficiency of this insecticide in controlling the whitefly
is due to its ovicidal action as well as its high capacity of
laminar translocation (PALUMBO et al., 2001). It is
possible that in different circumstances than in this
study, in longer-enduring infestations, where the injuries
caused by the insects remained for a longer period or if
another, less efficient insecticide were used, thus
allowing a rapid resurgence of the pest, productivity
could be more severely affected by the feeding of B.
tabaci, and sooty mold would be more prevalent
(PEDIGO, 1996). These are hypotheses, however, that
need to be tested in future studies and do not impair the
importance of the results herein reported.

Another important point to take into
consideration is that before opting for a control method
for the management of a pest, it is essential to determine
whether the anticipated cost of the reduction in yield
caused by the pest will be higher than the cost of the
control method, a parameter that is taken into
consideration in the EIL calculation (STERN et al.,
1959). Thus, the EIL should be regarded as dynamic
and variable in different agricultural conditions, and
also the interactions among the components of its
definition must be taken into account (PEDIGO et al.,
1986). For soybeans, although it varies with different
localities and years, the cost of application of
piriproxifen is usually higher than the value of one
standard bag of soybeans (60kg), and this high cost
must also be taken into account in deciding on the
best time to initiate control.

Many so ybean gr ower s ar e ap plying
insecticide to control whiteflies at low infestation. In
Brazil, for example, insecticide spraying usually occurs
when 10 nymphs per leaflet are present. Often, this
control is decided empirically by field technicians,
according to personal perceptions acquired in their field
experience. The results obtained here, however, attest
that an application based on levels of infestations of
10 nymphs per leaflet is certainly much too early and
incurs unnecessary costs and environmental danger.
Nevertheless, for a broaden computation of the ET for
the whitefly, other experiments could be conducted, to
evaluate other factors such as different production
systems, different levels of pest infestation and
different agro-climate conditions, in addition to the
levels of tolerance among different soybean cultivars.
As stated above, it is also important to evaluate the
correlation between the number of nymphs and the
growth of sooty mold, since the occurrence of sooty
mold seems to be directly linked to the capacity of the
whitefly to reduce the soybean yield.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, based on the results obtained
here, only whitefly infestations severe enough to trigger
the growth of sooty mold would be able to reduce
soybean yield and justify the use of insecticides before
the fungus becomes widespread. The needless use of
insecticides in controlling B. tabaci when the number
of nymphs is still below the level of 40 nymphs per
leaflet should be avoided. It is important to point out
that these results are from a single soybean cultivar
and therefore is only a preliminary result in this field of
research. However, considering the cultivar used and
the climatic conditions of the trials (maximum and
minimum temperature of 30.8oC and 20.3oC, respectively,
and a precipitation of 821.8mm) this is an important
result and brings more appropriated economic threshold
(ET) for starting insecticide spray on soybean against
whitefly outbreaks.
