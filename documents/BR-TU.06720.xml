RESUMO 

BENITES, Mariana. Morphology and chemical composition of polymetallic 

nodules from the Clarion-Clippertone Zone, the Indian Ocean and Rio Grande 

Rise, a comparative study. 2017. 94 p. Dissertação (Mestrado) – Instituto

Nódulos polimetálicos de mar profundo são concreções de óxidos de 

manganês e de ferro ao redor de um núcleo. Os nódulos crescem através da 

precipitação hidrogenética – precipitação de metais da água do mar – ou diagenética 

– precipitação de metais da água intersticial do sedimento. O processo de acreção 

reflete na morfologia e geoquímica dos nódulos. Neste trabalho, quatorze nódulos 

polimetálicos provenientes de quatro regiões oceânicas – Clarion-Clippertone Zone 

(Oceano Pacífico Nordeste), Bacia Central do Índico (Oceano Índico Central), Bacia 

Mascarene (Oceano Índico Oeste) e Elevação de Rio Grande (Oceano Atlântico 

Sudoeste) – foram usados a fim de se comparar os aspectos morfológicos e 

geoquímicos dos nódulos entre regiões diferentes. A estrutura interna dos nódulos 

foi avaliada através da Tomografia Computadorizada por Raios-X (CT). Microscopia 

Eletrônica de Varredura (SEM) foi usada para descrever as micro camadas. A 

composição química foi determinada por Micro Fluorescência de Raios-X (µ-XRF) e 

por ablação a laser acoplada a espectrometria de massa com plasma indutivamente 

acoplado (LA-ICP-MS). Por fim, a Espectroscopia de Absorção de Raios-X próximo à 

borda (XANES) foi realizada a fim de se determinar a especiação (i.e., o número de 

oxidação) do Mn e do Fe. Os nódulos polimetálicos da Bacia Central do Índico são 

diagenéticos e os da Bacia Mascarene e Elevação do Rio Grande são hidrogênicos, 

enquanto que os da Clarion-Clippertone Zone são do tipo misto. Entretanto, o 

processo de acreção varia ao longo dos nódulos, resultando em textura das 

camadas e composição química heterogênea. Forte fracionamento entre Mn e Fe 

ocorre nos nódulos diagenéticos e do tipo misto, assim como entre os metais traço 

Ni, Cu, Co e Ti. O Mn e o Fe estão presentes nos nódulos principalmente na forma 

de espécies oxidadas Mn
4+

 e Fe
3+

, independentemente do efeito de fracionamento 

entre eles. Modelos esquemáticos do ambiente de formação dos nódulos são 

propostos e sugere-se que variações da profundidade da frente redox no sedimento 

ao longo do tempo são responsáveis pelo efeito de fracionamento entre o Mn e o Fe.

ABSTRACT 

BENITES, M. Morphology and chemical composition of polymetallic 

nodules from the Clarion-Clippertone Zone, the Indian Ocean and Rio Grande 

Rise, a comparative study. 2017. 94 p. Dissertation (Master) – Oceanographic 

Institute, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, 2017. 

Deep sea polymetallic nodules are concretions of manganese and iron oxides 

formed around a nucleus. They accrete either hydrogenetically – metals precipitate 

from the seawater – or diagenetically – metals precipitate from the sediment pore 

water. The accretion process affects both the nodules morphology and geochemistry. 

In this study, fourteen polymetallic nodules from four ocean regions, namely the 

Clarion-Clippertone Zone (Northeast Pacific Ocean), the Central Indian Basin 

(Central Indian Ocean), the Mascarene Basin (West Indian Ocean), and the Rio 

Grande Rise (Southwest Atlantic Ocean), were used to compare morphological and 

geochemical aspects between the different oceanic regions. Computed Tomography 

(CT) was applied to study the nodules internal structure. Scanning Electron 

Microscopy (SEM) was used to describe the micro layers within the nodules. 

Chemical composition of growth layers and nuclei was determined by both Micro X-

ray Fluoscence (?-XRF) and Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass 

Spectroscopy (LA-ICP-MS). Finally, X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy 

(XANES) was performed in order to determine the speciation (i.e., the oxidation 

state) of Mn and Fe. Polymetallic nodules from the Central Indian Basin are 

diagenetic and the ones from the Mascarene Basin and the Rio Grande Rise are 

hydrogenetic, while nodules from the Clarion-Clippertone Zone are of mixed type. 

However, the dominant accretion process varies across the nodules resulting in 

inhomogeneous layer textures and chemical composition. Strong Mn and Fe 

fractionation occurs in the diagenetic and mixed type nodules accompanied by 

fractionation of the trace elements Ni, Cu, Co and Ti. Mn and Fe are present in the 

nodules mainly as oxidized species Mn
4+

 and Fe
3+

, independently of the degree of 

fractionation. Schematic models of the nodules environment of formation are 

proposed, in which and the fractionation of Mn and Fe is possibly the result of the 

variation of the redox front depth through time.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Marine polymetallic nodules, also known as manganese nodules or 

ferromanganese nodules, are mineral concretions of manganese and iron oxides that form 

upon the seafloor about a nucleus at a rate of the order of 1 mm per 10
4
 to 10

6
 years 

(CRONAN, 1977; HEIN; KOSCHINSKY, 2014). Because of this extremely low growth rate, 

polymetallic nodules absorb high quantity of rare earth elements and trace elements of 

relevant economic interest (CRONAN, 1978; GLASBY, 2002; HEIN et al., 2013; HEIN; 

PETERSEN, 2013). Together with the marine cobalt-rich crusts, the nodules compose the 

so-called marine ferromanganese deposits (HEIN and KOCHICNKY 2014).  

Deep sea polymetallic nodules were early reported by Murray and Irvine (1895), 

who described the first nodules dredged from the seafloor in the Pacific during the 

Challenger Deep Sea Exploring Expedition (1872-1876). Since then, the marine 

polymetallic nodules deposits passed to be more systematically studied only in the 70s 

and 80s, when a more in deep scientific investigation, driven by economic interests, 

addressed the question on how they are formed (CRONAN; TOOMS, 1969; BONATTI; 

KRAEMER; RYDELL, 1972; GLASBY, 1977; CRONAN, 1978; BATURIN, 1988).  

Although the polymetallic nodules have been reported from a variety of marine 

environments, namely abyssal plains, seamounts, plateaus, mid-ocean ridges and 

continental margins (CRONAN, 1977), they are more concentrated in deep ocean basins. 

The largest polymetallic nodules fields known to date are located in the Pacific abyssal 

plains (up to 5000 m depth) of the Clarion-Clippertone Zone (CCZ), in the Peru Basin (PB) 

and in the Central Indian Basin (CIB). The CCZ hosts the largest and more extensively 

studied deposit, where nodules density is about 15 kg per m
2
 and reaches 75 kg per m

2
 in 

some areas (HEIN; PETERSEN, 2013).   

Polymetallic nodules are more concentrated in abyssal plains where the  

sedimentation rate is low, of the order of a few mm per 10
3
 years (GLASBY, 2006). Where 

sedimentation is inhibited by bottom currents, oxygenation at the sea floor is constant, 

which promotes oxidation of Mn and Fe (PUTEANUS; HALBACH, 1988; HEIN; 

PETERSEN, 2013). Deep ocean basins are mostly washed by deep water masses 

enriched in dissolved oxygen, for example the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) bathing the 

nodules deposits in the Pacific Ocean (GLASBY, 2006), in the Indian Ocean (VINEESH et 

al., 2009) and in the Atlantic Ocean (KASTEN et al., 1998).  



14 
 

The main mechanisms of nodules growth are hydrogenetic accretion and diagenetic 

accretion of Mn and Fe layers, well described by many authors (GLASBY, 1977; 

HALBACH; MARCHIG; SCHERHAG, 1980; HALBACH et al., 1981; DYMOND et al., 1984; 

HALBACH, 1986; BATURIN, 1988; HEIN et al., 1997). The prevailing growth mechanism 

is linked to the environment of formation. 

Hydrogenetic accretion occurs by oxidation and precipitation of colloidal metals from 

seawater at a rate of 1 to 10 mm Myr
-1

 (HEIN; PETERSEN, 2013). On the other hand, 

diagenetic growth occurs by oxidation and precipitation of metals from sediment pore 

water, which became remobilized due to the decay of sedimentary organic matter. 

Diagenetic accretion takes place at rates of the order of 100 mm Myr
-1

 or more (DYMOND 

et al., 1984; HEIN; PETERSEN, 2013). During hydrogenetic precipitation, Mn and Fe form 

respectively ?-MnO2 (vernadite) and FeOOH. Both compounds incorporate trace 

elements, such as Co, Pb, Ti and rare earth elements (REE), by surface sorption. The 

Mn/Fe ratio is about 1 and Mn, Cu, and Ni concentrations are relatively low (HALBACH et 

al., 1981; VERLAAN; CRONAN; MORGAN, 2004; GLASBY; LI; SUN, 2013). 

Diagenetic precipitation is characterized by enrichment in Mn, Cu and Ni – metals 

released by diagenesis of sedimentary organic matter – and Mn/Fe ratios &gt;5. Mn 

precipitates as phyllomanganates, which exhibit lattice vacancies in which divalent cations 

like Ni
2+

, Cu
2+

 and Zn
2+

 are incorporated (BURNS; BURNS, 1977).  

The morphology and geochemistry of polymetallic nodules are extremely dependent 

on their genetic process. A classification of polymetallic nodules in terms of their genetic 

mechanism was proposed by Halbach et al. (1981) and is still widely used. This 

classification divides nodules into type A (diagenetic), type B (hydrogenetic) and type AB 

(mixed-type). Most of polymetallic nodules are classified as type AB and form at 

intermediate grow rates of tenths of mm Myr
-1

 (HEIN; PETERSEN, 2013). This is the case 

of the nodules from the CCZ and the Central Indian Basin (HEIN et al., 1997; VINEESH et 

al., 2009; GONZÁLEZ et al., 2010; MAYUMY AMPARO et al., 2013). Type A nodules are 

found in the Peru Basin (WEGORZEWSKI; KUHN, 2014), while type B nodules are found 

in the Cook Islands (HEIN et al., 2015). 

Bacterial activity may play a role in the mineralization process of nodules, as 

suggested by the finding of Mn-cycling bacteria within nodules layers (WANG et al., 2009; 

WANG; GAN; MÜLLER, 2009; BLÖTHE et al., 2015). However, the details about 

bacterially-induced mineralization are still to be understood.

Environmental conditions determine which genetic type is dominant in a given 

polymetallic deposit (figure 1) (HEIN; PETERSEN, 2013). Upon consolidated sediment 

and even on hard rock substrate polymetallic nodules grow on total exposure to seawater. 

In these conditions nodule accretion is dominantly hydrogenetic. In contrast, diagenetic 

accretion dominates in unconsolidated and porous sediment, where metal are remobilized 

in interstitial water. Mixed-type nodules, formed by a combination of hydrogenetic and 

diagenetic growth, are more common on seamounts and in deep sedimentary basins. 

 

 

Figure 1 Formation environments of polymetallic nodules, from hard rock at seamounts to porous 
sediment at deep ocean basins. From Hein and Petersen (2013). 

 

The type of substrate is not the only factor to govern the accretion process of 

nodules. The availability of nuclei and the sediment composition, together with the organic 

matter input to the sediments, are fundamental in determining which accretion process 

prevail. Typical nuclei for nodule accretion are shells, shark’s teeth, whale’s ear-bones, 

weathered volcanic rocks, pumice, hardened sediment, and fragments of nodules formed 

previously (GLASBY, 2006).  

The main factor controlling the intensity of diagenesis is the sedimentation rate of 

organic matter, which in turns is a result of biological productivity in surface waters 

(HALBACH, 1986). Regions of the ocean where the surface primary productivity is higher 

correspond to the ones in which the seafloor hosts diagenetic polymetallic nodules, as for 

example the Peru Basin (DYMOND et al., 1984) and the eastern South Atlantic (KASTEN 

et al., 1998). Low productivity surface waters, on the other hand, correspond to those 



16 
 

settings where hydrogenetic nodules are found, like in the southwestern Pacific Basin 

(GLASBY, 2006) and in the Brazilian Basin (KASTEN et al., 1998). 

Regarding the polymetallic nodules composition, nodules tend to be enriched in Mn, 

Fe, Ti, Mg, P, Ni, Cu, Mo, Zn, Co, Pb, Sr, V, Y, Li and REEs relative to the surrounding 

sediments, while they tend to be in Si, Al and Ba, indicating that these elements have a 

terrigenous origin (PATTAN; PARTHIBAN, 2011). 

The morphology of nodules reflects the conditions of their formation (BATURIN, 

1988). Morphological aspects have been used to classify polymetallic deposits, in that a 

relationship exists between nodules size, abundancy, distribution, Mn/Fe ratio and tonnage 

of elements of economic interest (MAYUMY AMPARO et al., 2013; VALSANGKAR; 

REBELLO, 2015). According to (VINEESH et al., 2009), characteristics such as size, 

shape and surficial texture depend on oceanographic variables of the basin where the 

nodules are formed, namely topography, currents, bottom water masses and sediment 

type. Smooth surficial texture has been related to dominantly hydrogenetic growth 

(MAYUMY AMPARO et al., 2013).  

Morphological studies relying on a high number of samples have been performed 

(VINEESH et al., 2009; MAYUMY AMPARO et al., 2013; VALSANGKAR; REBELLO, 

2015). Nevertheless, none of them considered in detail the internal structure of the 

nodules. Nowadays, thanks to the CT X-ray tomography, it is possible to obtain a high 

resolution imaging of the interior of the nodules in a non-destructive way, without the need 

of cutting the nodules, as performed in this study. 

Regarding their internal structure, polymetallic nodules present individual concentric 

layers which may be inhomogeneous in composition and texture. This heterogeneity is 

considered to be due to changes in environmental conditions during nodules accretion. 

Hydrogenetic and diagenetic growth have been found to be alternate between individual 

nodule layers (WEGORZEWSKI; KUHN, 2014), revealing that nodule growth is not in a 

steady-state and does record changes in environmental conditions during nodule 

formation.  

Despite the extensive literature on the genesis of deep sea polymetallic nodules, 

the link between formation mechanisms, internal structure, external morphology and 

geochemical composition of nodules is still poorly documented. 

Moreover, even though the occurrence of polymetallic nodules on the flank of the 

Rio Grande Rise was reported by Milliman and Amaral (1974), no scientific work exists 

about their morphological and geochemical characterization, or about how these deposits 



17 
 

were formed. This is the first study in which the morphology and the geochemical 

composition of a nodule from this region are studied in detail, which is of great importance 

for marine research in Brazil. 

This Master Thesis aims to test the hypothesis that polymetallic nodules from 

different ocean regions may exhibit distinct morphology and chemical compositions, 

although they were formed by the same process (diagenetic or hydrogenetic).

2. OBJECTIVES 

The main goal of this work is to link the mechanisms of nodules formation with their 

morphology and chemical composition in four ocean regions. For this purpose, 

polymetallic nodules from the Clarion-Clippertone Zone (Northeast Pacific Ocean), the 

Central Indian Basin (Central Indian Ocean), the Mascarene Basin (Western Indian 

Ocean) and the Rio Grande Rise (Southwest Atlantic) were studied aiming to attain the 

following objectives: 

? Describe and compare nodules from different locations, focusing on their external 

morphology (size, shape and surficial texture); 

? Describe and compare nodules from different locations, focusing on their internal 

structure (thickness and texture of layers and nuclei); 

? Determine the major, trace and rare elements composition across the nodules; 

? Reveal the geochemical processes that might have acted in the different ocean 

basins. 

 

The fundamental questions that this work addresses are the following: 

? Do the samples used in this work match the genetic type classification described 

in the literature for the regions under study? 

? Does Mn/Fe ratio vary in the same way in all the basins? 

? Why does this variation happen? And why does it not?

3. STUDY AREAS AND CORRESPONDING NODULES DEPOSITS 

The Clarion-Clippertone Zone (CCZ) corresponds to the ocean basin comprised 

between the Clarion Fracture Zone and the Clipperton Fracture Zone (figure 2B). The 

ocean floor at the site is 4000-4500 m deep, punctuated by volcanic seamounts rising up 

to 2500 m. Deep-sea plains alternated with elongated, approximately N-S oriented horsts 

and grabens of several kilometres length and height of 100-300 m.  

The flat, sediment-covered seafloor is composed by pelagic clay and siliceous ooze 

(diatoms and radiolaria), deposited at a rate of 0.35-0.5 cm kyr
-1

 (MEWES et al., 2014). 

Sediment lacks carbonates as the site is slightly below the carbonate compensation depth. 

Ferromanganese nodules abundance is on average 10 to 30 kg m
-2

 (RUHLEMANN et al., 

2011).  

Dissolved oxygen is detectable in the sediment pore water until 2-3 m below sea 

floor (MEWES et al. 2014). Oxygen measurements in pore water suggest that 

hydrogenetic and oxic-diagenetic processes control the present-day growth of nodules at 

the study area, since Mn from deeper anoxic sediments is does not reach the sediment 

surface (MEWES et al. 2014; RUHLEMANN et al. 2011). 

The equatorial high bioproductivity zone is located south of the CCZ and produces 

one of the broader oxygen minimum zones in the global ocean, as a result of upwelling in 

the eastern Pacific (STRAMMA et al., 2008). The oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) is broad, 

with a thickness of 400 – 1000 m, which is more pronounced off Mexico and gradually 

weakens to the north and west (ZHENG et al., 2000). 

The carbonate compensation depth (CCD) in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone is 

between 4200 and 4500 m water depth (INTERNATIONAL SEABED AUTHORITY - ISA, 

2010). Sediment distribution is influenced by the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) low 

bottom-current velocities, which is less than 10 cm s
-1

 predominantly north-westward and 

highly oxygenated (JOHNSON, 1972). 

The Central Indian Basin (CIB) is an isolated basin bounded by three ridge systems 

on its western (Central Indian Ridge), eastern (Ninety Ridge System) and southern (Mid-

Indian Ridge) limits (figure 2C). These ridges act as barrier to strong bottom water currents 

and terrigenous sediments from all around with exception of the northern boundary. 

Consequently, the CIB is covered by terrigenous sediments in the northern part (from 



20 
 

Ganges and Bhramaputra rivers) (up to 5°S latitude). The rest of the basin is covered by 

siliceous radiolarian ooze with sporadic calcareous patches (central part) and red clay 

(southern part) (BANERJEE; MIURA, 2001). Sedimentation rates in the CIB are between 

2.7 and 3.4 mm kyr
-1

 (BANAKAR; GUPTA; PADMAVATHI, 1991) and the bottom 

morphology varies between abyssal hills and seamounts.  

The CIB’s physical characteristics provide a favourable environment for the 

polymetallic nodules to grow, being this the basin richest in nodules in the whole Indian 

Ocean. Dominant parameters controlling nodules in the CIB are topography, bottom water 

current and water depth (VINEESH et al., 2009). Nodules from the central deep basin are 

large, older and rough, while they are small and smooth in the southeastern part, where 

the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) enters through deep saddles in the Ninety Ridge 

System. Also, small and smooth nodules dominate locally on the top of seamounts. Older 

nodules from the protected deeper basins are of diagenetic origin and less influenced by 

strong water current, while bottom water currents lead to Fe-rich small and smooth 

nodules in the eastern part of the basin affected by the AABW (VINEESH et al., 2009).  

The Mascarene basin (MB) is comprised between Madagascar Island and the 

Mascarene Plateau and is located to the north of Mauritius Island (figure 2C), formed by 

basic volcanic rocks, extruded as lava flows. The sediment type of the basin is mostly 

calcareous clay/ooze. The sediment composition varies from sand to silt in shallower 

areas to mostly silt clay in deep water. The sediment coarse fraction is composed by 

preserved planktonic foraminifera, as the basin is above the CCD and the effect of 

dissolution is not pronounced. Clay minerals are composed mostly of montmorillonite, 

kaolinite and chlorite, which are indicative of tropical weathering of basic volcanic rocks. 

Sedimentation rate in the Mascarene Basin is low, especially in the northern part, between 

1.4 and 11.3 m kyr
-1

 (NATH; PRASAD, 1991).  

Polymetallic nodules from the Mascarene Basin have been studied and found to be 

of hydrogenetic origin based on their internal structures and on morphological, chemical, 

and mineralogical characteristics. Their surficial texture is mostly smooth, growth layers 

are dominantly columnar, with vernadite as the main Mn mineral phase, enriched in Fe, 

Co, REE (Ce in particular) and depleted in Mn, Ni and Cu. These nodules originate from 

an oxygenated environment, due to the presence of Antarctic Bottom Water with low 

sedimentation rates (NATH; PRASAD, 1991). 

The Rio Grande Rise (RGR) is an elevation of more than 4000 m from the 

surrounding abyssal basin in the Brazilian Basin, western South Atlantic (figure 2D). The 



21 
 

sediments at the crest of RGR are dominantly calcareous ooze (nannofossils and 

planktonic foraminifera) with a siliceous component (FLORINDO et al., 2015). The area is 

characterized by a strong northward flow of the AABW, which causes erosion of the 

bottom sediments (EMELYANOV, 2015). The RGR bottom environment and its 

polymetallic deposits are yet to be described and understood. 

Polymetallic nodules from the west South Atlantic Ocean have been found to be 

mostly hydrogenetic in origin compared to the mostly diagenetic nodules from the eastern 

South Atlantic (KASTEN et al., 1998). Moreover, the sediments from the North Brazilian 

Basin have been described as hydrogenetic polymetallic deposits enriched in 

hydrothermal Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides relative to other basins in the Atlantic Ocean 

(DUBININ; RIMSKAYA-KORSAKOVA, 2011).

4. MATERIAL AND METHODS 

4.1. Samples and methods summary 

Polymetallic nodules used in this work are from the CCZ (4 nodules) in the Pacific 

Ocean, from the CIB (5 nodules), from the MB (3 nodules) in the Indian Ocean and from 

RGR (1 Fe-Mn coated pebble) in the southwestern Atlantic. 

The samples from the CCZ are identified as JC120-104 and were collected during 

the oceanographic cruise JC120 on board of the RRV James Cook by Agassiz trawl on 

14/5/2015 at 21:20:00 GMT at the location 13° 30.42’N, 116° 35.1295’W and 4130 m 

depth (figure 1). The nodules from the CIB were collected during different cruises: AAS21 

and AAS40 on board of RV Akademic Alexander Sidorenko (Galenzik, Russia) by Okean 

Grab.  

Nodules from the MB were collected during the oceanographic cruise SK35 on 

board of the ORV Sagar Kanya (Ministry of Earth Sciences [MoES; formerly Department of 

Ocean Development (DOD)], Government of India) during October-November 1987 by 

Dredge, Vann Grab and Freefall Grab (table 1). The Fe-Mn coated pebble from the RGR 

was collected by accident together with material dredged from the bottom during the 

oceanographic cruise Iatá-Piuna on board of the R/V Yokosuka.

The nodules were photographed, measured and finally scanned by three 

dimensions X-Ray Computed Tomography (CT). The shape and surface texture were 

classified following the nomenclature used by Glasby (1977) and Vineesh et al. (2009), in 

which the shape is: (1) spheroidal; (2) ellipsoidal; (3) discoidal; (4) tabular; (5) polynodules 

(6) biomorphic –when it reflects the shape of a biological material; or (7) faceted – when it 

follows the angular shape of a clastic nucleus. In this classification, the surface texture is 

defined as: (1) rough; (2) smooth or (3) botryoidal. The layers textures were classified 

according to Halbach et al. (1981) as: (1) massive; (2) dendritic; (3) laminar; or (4) 

columnar. 

Next, thin sections with approximately 100 µm thickness were prepared from the 

nodules JC120-104B, AAS21-DR19, SS4-280G, SK35/24B and SK35/26A. These thin 

sections were used for Scanning Electron Microcopy and for two kinds of Synchrotron 

analyses, namely Micro X-ray Fluorescence and X-ray Absorption Near Edge. Polished 

sections 7 – 8 mm thick were also prepared for Laser Ablation – Inductively Coupled 

Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (LA-ICP-MS) analysis at the National Oceanographic Centre, 

Southampton, UK. 

 

4.2. X-ray Computed Tomography 

Three dimensions Computed Tomography (CT) were run using a Versa XRM-510 

Xradia equipment from Zeiss at the Technological Characterization Laboratory from 

Escola Politécnica, University of Sao Paulo. 

All the nodules were scanned for 2 hours while turning under a 160 kV 10 W X-rays 

source. Pixel size was 55 µm and detector resolution of 1024 x 1024 pixels, transmission 

of 8 – 19%.  

 



25 
 

4.3. Preparation of thin sections and polished sections  

Thin sections (100 µm thick) were prepared at the Institute of Geoscience of the 

University of Sao Paulo. Firstly, the nodules were embedded in a 6:1 solution of epoxy 

resin and hardener and kept under vacuum (-25 mPa) for six hours in order to ensure resin 

penetration. Samples were then dried in an oven for two days. 

Once the resin was completely dried, the nodules were cut in two halves. A second 

cut was made parallel to the first one, in order to get a slab approximately 5 mm thick. The 

first cut was done using a metal jaw and the second one was done using a diamond wire, 

both using water cooling. 

The surface of the slabs was impregnated with epoxy resin to avoid material loss 

during grinding. To do this, the slabs were placed onto a hot plate where a solution of 

epoxy resin, hardener and acetone was poured onto the slab surface. 

Once the resin was dried, the slabs were grinded on a diamond wheel 320 with SiC 

600 grit. Then, the slabs were placed on glass slides and cut into 100 µm sections. Next, 

they were polished using a polish cloth 8’’ DiaMat from Allied High Tech Products under 

180 RPM rotation adding a mixture of alumina 1 µm and Ethane Diol oil. Finally, the thin 

sections were coated with carbon to give them the electric conductivity necessary for SEM 

analysis. 

Polished sections were also prepared for LA-ICP-MS analyses at the National 

Oceanographic Centre. The nodules sections embedded in resin were cut into a 7 – 8 mm 

thick slab and their surface was grinded using a 37 µm fixed diamond wheel, making sure 

to keep the sample flat. Then, the samples were lapped using 9 ?m SiC on flat glass to 

remove any grinding marks and to prepare the surface for polishing. Polishing of the 

samples was done on a flat wheel with 15um, 9um, 3um, and finally 1um diamond at 80 

rpm for around 10 minutes each. The samples were cleaned between each stage and 

were polished in different orientations to prevent striations. 

 

4.4. Scanning Electron Microscopy 

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrographs were performed using a Leo 

440i from Leo Electron Microscopy Ltd at the Laboratory of Scanning Electron Microscopy 

(LabMEV), Institute of Geosciences of the University of Sao Paulo. 



26 
 

Secondary Electron (SE) and Backscatter Electron (BSE) micrographs were taken 

from selected points previously observed by optical microscopy. The control of the 

positions of each point was possible due to a XY coordination system standardized 

between the optical microscope and the SEM. Analyses were performed at high vacuum 

condition with Electron High Tension (EHT) of 20 keV, Work Distance (WD) of 25 mm and 

Iprobe of 1.0 - 2.0 nA (probe current).  

Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy was performed in a Si (Li) solid state detector with 

INCA 300 software from Oxford Microanalysis group.  

 

4.5. Synchrotron Radiation Analyses 

Synchrotron Radiation analyses applied in this work included micro X-ray 

Fluorescence (µ-XRF) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) and were 

performed at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS), XRF Beamline, from 19th 

– 23th September 2016 and from 14th – 18th February 2017. Thin sections of the samples 

JC120-104B, AAS21-19, SS4-280G, SK35-26 and SK35-24 were analyzed in order to 

map the distribution of elements and to gather information on the oxidation state of Fe and 

Mn present in the nodules. 

Micro-XRF punctual measurements were performed in triplicate at selected points in 

all nodules in order to obtain the elemental composition. Afterwards, 0.1 mm thick 

transects across the nodules were performed to get profiles of elemental composition 

variability. Those transects were obtained on steps of 0.02 mm and count time per point of 

600 ms, with a velocity of 0.0328 mm.s
-1

. 

Both punctual analysis and maps, including transects, were acquired at 10 keV. 

Filters of Fe 3 mm plus Fe 6 mm were used because of the high content of Fe in the 

samples, what caused dead time of nearly 100%. After adding the filters, the dead time 

dropped to less than 10%. 

The spectrograms were then processed using the open software PyMCA Software 

Version 5.1.2, downloaded from http://pymca.sourceforge.net/download.html, where the 

curves were calibrated, Excel files were generated and color maps were obtained. From 

the Excel files, curves of relative elemental concentration were plotted and the Mn/Fe ratio 

was calculated. 

http://pymca.sourceforge.net/download.html


27 
 

XANES measurements were realized focusing on the absorption spectra of Fe and 

Mn for samples JC120-104B, SS4-280, SK35-26, and RGR, thus one nodule analyzed for 

each ocean basin considered. XANES scans were performed three times for each point, in 

order to increase analytical precision. Metal foils of Mn and Fe were used for beam 

calibration. Internal standards of FeOOH, FeO, Fe2O3, MnO, MnO2 and Mn3O4 were also 

scanned. XANES curves were processed using the Athena Software from the Demeter 

XAS package, available at https://bruceravel.github.io/demeter/. XANES data processing 

included pre-edge and post-edge normalization. Each XANES datum results from the 

average of the triplicate measurements. Self-absorption correction was not performed 

because no stoichiometric formula of the sample matrix is available. However, this 

correction is not critical for the purpose of this study, because self-absorption affects only 

the height of the peaks but not their position on the energy axis. The identification of the 

Mn and Fe species were done by comparing the energy position of the first derivative of 

the samples curve with the patterns curves using the Athena Software. 

 

4.6. Laser Ablation - Inductively Coupled Plasma – Mass Spectroscopy 

Elemental analyses were performed by LA-ICP-MS at the National Oceanographic 

Centre, Southampton using a New Wave UP213 laser ablation system coupled to a 

Thermo X-Series II quadrupole ICP-MS. 

Polished section of nodules JC120-104B, AAS21-19, SS4-280, SK35-26, SK35-24 

and the coated pebble RGR were loaded into the laser’s sample holder along with 

polished chips of NIST 610, NIST 612, BHVO-2G and BCG-2G reference glass standards. 

The tranference of ablated material into the ICP-MS occurs through He flow via a three 

port mixing bulb. All ICP-MS and laser settings were optimized for optimal sensivity and 

stability. 

The New Wave laser system software was used to map across each sample and 

standard and to set the shot positions, which were aligned along a transect across the 

nodule sample with shot interval space of 0.25 mm.

A set of multiple measurements of the standards was performed every one hour. 

Each of the four standards was measured 10 times under the same parameters used for 

the sample material.  

Data calibration was carried out by producing a 5-point calibration line using the 

values of: (1) gas blank; (2) average NIST 610; (3) average NIST 612; (4) average BHVO-

2G; and (5) average BCR-2G.  

Reference concentration values for the analytes of interest are the “preferred” 

values extracted from the GeoReM database [see: georem.mpch-mainz.gwdg.de]. 

Calibration factors were determined for each element by comparing the measured 

Counts per Second (CPS) values of the standards with their certified concentration. These 

factors were then applied to calibrate all unknown shots (external calibration). The element 

Fe (
56

Fe) could not be determined due to the mass interference of Ar and O (

O).

5. RESULTS 

5.1. Clarion-Clippertone Zone, Northeast Pacific Ocean 

Nodules from the CCZ (JC120-104A, JC120-104B, JC120-104C and JC120-104D) 

are 8 cm average long, discoidal and exhibit rough surface textures (figure 3 A-D). The 

surface texture is more botryoidal than rough on the top side (figure 4A) and purely rough 

on the bottom side (figure 4B), where the nodule surface is more friable. The CCZ nodules 

present also a pronounced rim marking the transition between rough and rough-botryoidal 

texture. This rim corresponds to the limit between the buried and exposed portion of the 

nodules (i.e., the sediment-water interface). Biological structure like whitish-beige worm 

tubes and radiolaria tests are found attached to the nodules surface on both sides, but 

dominantly on the botryoidal one (figure 4C and D). 

 

 

 

Figure 3 Nodules from the Clarion-Clippertone Zone.

Figure 4 Surface texture of nodules from the Clarion-Clippertone Zone. (A) top and (B) bottom side 
and hard organisms attached to (C) top and (D) bottom side of nodule JC120-104B. 

 

Regarding the internal structure, nodules from the CCZ present no apparent 

nucleus and two distinct structure patterns: (1) an internal and (2) an external one. Both of 

them show a variable layering (figure 5). The internal portion shows alternation of porous 

and massive thick (1-3 mm) layers. The high-density contrast between these layers can be 

visualized by the variability of grey tons on the tomography images (figure 5). This portion 

of nodule apparently grew in a preferential direction, resulting in a conic geometry 

indicated by the yellow arrow in figure 5. The external portion, however, presents 

alternation between thin (50-200 µm) bright and dark layers which grew all around the 

internal portion. This fact suggests that the internal portion of the nodule likely served as 

nucleus for the external portion. Thus, the internal portions of the CCZ nodules likely 

correspond to a former deposit that experienced different environmental conditions in 

comparison to the recent deposit, as reflected by their distinct morphological aspects. This 

former deposit comprises 60 – 80% of the nodules size. Still, the recent oxide layer is 

thicker on the one side relatively to the opposite one (figure 6). The morphological features 

of the nodules from the CCZ in the Pacific Ocean are summarized by table 3.

The SEM micrographs revealed in detail the texture of layers inside the nodules. 

The thin layers encountered within the external portion are mostly botryoidal, with variable 

grey tone and variable thickness, much thinner than the layers from the internal portion 

(figure 6A). The micrographs confirm that the bright thick layers are massive and alternate 

with the porous layers in which the rock grew following a cauliflower – dendritic pattern, as 

described by Halbach et al. (1981) (figure 6B and 6C).

Figure 7 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrograph and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy 
maps of chemical elements on the edge of nodule JC120-104D from the Clarion-Clippertone Zone, 

Pacific Ocean. 

 

SEM-EDS maps of the sample JC120-104D showed a clear relation between the 

texture of the layer and the concentration of major elements (figure 7). Mn and Fe 

alternate in a way in that Mn-rich layers correspond to the more porous ones, while the 

Fe-rich layers correspond to the more massive ones. Mn is accompanied by Ni, and at a 

lower degree by Cu. Fe, on the other hand, is accompanied by Cl and Ti to a lesser 

degree. Si is highly concentrated at some spots, where detrital material is probably 

present.  

Micro-XRF analyses reveal that the elemental composition of nodules consists 

mainly of Mn, Fe, Cu, Ni, Zn, Ce, Ca, Ti, Co, Sr and K (table 4). The most noticeable 

fact is the high standard deviation of the values, showing the high compositional 

variability inside each nodule.  

LA-ICP-MS data show that the most dominant elements are Mn, Si, Ca and K, 

which concentration is given in %. All the other elements are expressed in ppm and 

present the following order of magnitude: (1) 10000 ppm for Ti, Ni and Cu; (2) 1000 ppm 

for Co, Zn, Sr, Ba, Pb and the total REY; (3) 100 ppm for V, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, La, Ce and 

Nd; (4) 10 ppm for Sc, Cr, Pr, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Er, Yb, Hf, Th and U; (5) 1 ppm for Cs, 



34 
 

Tb, Ho, Tm and Lu; and (6) 0.1 ppm for Ta and Pt (Appendix A table 1). Like for the µ-

XRF data, the element concentrations obtained by LA-ICP-MS are highly variable, with 

generally high standard deviations (table 4).

When looking at the element concentration profile obtained by µ-XRF across the 

nodule JC120-104B, it is possible to see that CCZ nodules present a distinct alternation 

between Mn enriched and Fe enriched layers, both on the external and the internal 

sample as evidenced by the ?-XRF maps and the curves (figure 8). In these elemental 

composition maps, Mn and Fe signal intensities are represented by red and green color 

scales, respectively. Metal composition diagrams also show that Ni and Cu follow the 

behavior of Mn, while Co and Ti follow the behavior of Fe. The Mn/Fe ratio varies 

between 2 and 40 with mean value of 10. The highest Mn/Fe ratios (up to 40) are found 

in the massive layers in the internal portion of the nodule. A correspondence between 

thick and massive layers to high Mn content and porous texture to high Fe content is 

observed.

the nodule and (b) B-B’ on the inner part of the nodule JC120-104B from the Clarion-Clippertone 

Zone, Northeast Pacific Ocean. 

 

Results of LA-ICP-MS measurements across the JC120-104B sample show that 

on the bottom side of the nodule (transect A-A’) Cu varies in harmony with Mn, while Ti 

and the REE show an opposite behavior (figure 9). However, on the top side of the 



37 
 

nodule (transect C-C’) the opposite behavior of the groups Cu-Mn and Ti-REE is not 

observed, nor is it observed across the first half of the points analyzed in the internal 

portion. Still, REE are less concentrated in the bottom side. It is relevant to remember 

that the external layers at the top side are thinner than the bottom one. 

The alternation between Mn-rich and Mn-poor layers exists. Fe could not be 

measured by this analytical technique, but relying on the fact that the Mn pattern is the 

same as the one obtained by µ-XRF, the Fe pattern is predicted to be similar as well. In 

the internal portion, the Mn concentration obtained by LA-ICP-MS seems not to agree 

with the ?-XRF data, since the highest Mn concentration does not always correspond to 

the massive layers, as it was found based on ?-XRF data.  

XANES spectra of the four points measured in nodule JC120-104B showed the 

first derivative closest to the energy of the standards Mn3O4 and MnO2 (on the X axis) 

(figure 10). The height of the curve (on the Y axis) is meaningless, since it is disturbed 

by a self-absorption effect that could not be corrected for. In the same way, the spectra 

of Fe absorption showed the first derivative closest to Fe2O3 and FeOOH. These results 

indicate that both the Mn and the Fe present in the nodule are present in the oxidized 

form.

5.2. Central Indian Basin 

Nodules from the Central Indian Ocean (AAS40, AAS21-17, AAS21-19, SS4-280 

and F8-398) are 3-6 cm long (figure 11) with spheroidal to elongate shape, except for 

nodule F8-398a that is faceted. These nodules present a rough to smooth surface texture 

all over their surfaces as exemplified by AAS21-19 (figures 12), with the exception of 

nodule F8-398a which is smooth. Biological structures, like hard worm tubes, are also 

found upon the nodules surface, but to a lesser degree relative to the CCZ nodules. 

Three of the four nodules from the Central Indian Basin are polynucleated (figure 

13), which results from oxides growth around more than one nucleus. In these nodules, 

the nuclei correspond to 40-50% of the nodules volume. Nodule SS4-280, on the other 

hand, is mononucleated and exhibits a small nucleus relative to its size (10%). Layer 

texture varies between dendritic and botryoidal, with a high-density contrast between the 

two textures (figure 14). The dendritic layers present the highest porosity. The 

morphological aspects of the nodules from the CIB are summarized in table 5.

Nodules from the CIB are composed mainly by Mn, Fe, Cu, Ni, Co, Zn, Ca, Ti, Ce, 

K and Sr and show similar chemical characteristics (table 6 and 7). Both nodules AAS21-

19 (figure 15) and SS4-280 (figure 16) show very variable Mn/Fe ratios, between 0.5 and 

10, with the lowest values measured in nuclei and in the layers around them. Cu and Ni 

are the more abundant metals after Mn and Fe and vary similarly to Mn. Co and Ti are 

generally close to detection limit, which results in very noisy signals. However, the signals 

get stronger where Fe abundance is higher.

(figures 17 and 18). Nodule SS4-280, however, presents a higher variability for all the 

elements. Si shows a behavior opposite to Mn in both nodules, while Ti and REE are 

neither concordant nor opposite to Mn.

5.3. Mascarene Basin 

Nodules from the Mascarene Basin are, on average, 4 cm long and strongly 

spheroidal (SK35-26 and SK35-27) or elongate (SK35-24) (figures 20). Their surface 

texture is smooth and homogeneous on all sides (figure 21). Some of them results from 

clustering of two or more smaller nodules (SK35-26 and SK35-27), the surface of which is 

also characterized by micro botryoides. Biological structures are absent on the spheroidal 

specimens.  

CT tomography revealed that nodule SK35-24 comprehends an elongated nucleus 

which occupies most of the nodule volume (up to 80%), with a thin oxide layer (figure 22). 

In contrast, nodules SK35-26 and SK35-27 present small nuclei (22 to 40% of the total 

volume) and thick ferromanganese layers. Both are the result of the clustering of two or 

more nodules, and it is possible to identify the layer grown after the clustering. CT 

tomography shows that the MB nodules are internally homogeneous, with no density 

contrast between the layers.

Based on the variability of the grey tones, layer thickness varies between 0.2 and 0.5 

mm. A summary of the morphological features of the nodules from MB are presented in

The chemical composition of the nodules from the MB is also very variable within 

each nodule, as indicated by the high standard deviations of most of the chemical 

elements measured by both ?-XRF and LA-ICP-MS (tables 9 and 10). However, the 

nodules from the MB differ clearly from the CCZ and CIB because they exhibit Mn/Fe 

ratios closer to 1 over most of their length (figures 24 and 25). They also differ from the 

CCZ and the CIB nodules in that they are significantly enriched in Ti and Co which, 

instead of Cu and Ni, are the most abundant elements after Mn and Fe.

LA-ICP-MS analysis shows that Ti concentration is higher than that of Cu (figures 

26 and 27). REE are twice or three times more abundant than in nodules from the CCZ 

and CIB. The curves of abundance of Mn, Ti, Cu, Co and REE are relatively similar. Si 

is the only element that presents a different pattern, sometimes even opposite to the 

other elements. 

The elemental composition obtained by both ?-XRF and LA-ICP-MS resulted in 

an apparent internal symmetry in the nodules from the MB.

5.4. Rio Grande Rise 

The nodule from the Rio Grande Rise is 2 cm long, spheroidal, with a micro 

botryoidal surface texture surrounded by orange material (figure 29). One of its sides is 

covered by fine calcareous tests (figure 29D).  

The RGR coated pebble is made up by a thin oxide layer formed around the 

nucleus, which represents almost 90% of the nodule’s volume (figure 30). Changes in the 

grey scale suggest that the oxide layer is generally 0.2 mm thick, reaching 0.7 mm on one 

side (figure 31). A single layer of variable thickness – 0.5 to 0.3 mm – surrounds the 

nucleus.  

The texture of the thicker portion of the layers is laminated to botryoidal, while in the 

thinner portion it is dendritic (figure 31). The morphological features of the RGR coated 

pebble are summarized in table 11.

Several aspects previously described for the nodules from the others ocean basin 

are observed also in the RGR coated pebble. For example, the standard deviations of the 

concentrations of most of the chemical elements is high (table 12), often higher than the 

average concentration. 

µ-XRF data show an average Fe concentration higher than those of Mn, while Co 

and Ti are the most abundant metals after Fe and Mn, like in the nodules from the 

Mascarene Basin. In order of abundance, the RGR coated pebble is composed of Fe, Mn, 

Ca, Co, Ti, Ni, K, Sr, Cu and Zn. The elemental abundance across a transect from the 

nodule’s external surface to the nucleus show Mn/Fe ratio &amp;lt;1, as well as constant Fe, Mn, 

Ti and Co values (figure 32). Ni presents a noisy signal because of low concentration. The 

nucleus is enriched in Ca, as indicated by the color map, due to the presence of a high 

number of foraminiferal tests.

LA-ICP-MS results reveal that the coated pebble from RGR has the lowest Mn 

content of all the nodules studied (table 10). In contrast, the REE content is up to five 

times higher than in the nodules from the CCZ and CIB, and twice to three times higher 

than in the MB nodules. Transects 1 and 2, from the nodule’s edge to the nucleus, present 

opposite behavior for the curves of Mn and Si concentrations, and similar behavior for the 

curves of Ti, Co, Cu and REE, even though in the first 0.4 mm of transect 1 the Ti curve 

diverges from the others (figure 33). Also, REE concentrations in transect 1 are higher 

than in transect 2.

5.5. Statistical analysis 

The Principal Component Analysis performed using the ?-XRF average 

concentrations of chemical elements shows that most of the chemical elements group 

together, excepting for Mn and Fe that are separated (figure 35). The two Principal 



61 
 

Components (PC1 and PC2) together explain 97.8% of the total variance of the data. The 

samples from the CCZ and the CIB are more influenced by Mn, Cu and Ni. On the other 

hand, the samples from the MB and the RGR are more influenced by Fe, Ca, Co and Ti.

for the µ-XRF data with the scores of each Principal Component. Total variance explained by the two 

components together is 97.8%. 

  

The same analysis was applied for the LA-ICP-MS data and the Principal 

Components encountered were similar (figure 36). The nodules are segregated 

between those which are more influenced by Cu and Ni (nodules from the CCZ and 

CIB) and the ones which are more influenced by Ti and Co (nodules from the MB and 

RGR coated pebble). Mn appears as a non-influent element, however its measurement 

unit is % while Ni and Cu is expressed in ppm, which in absolute value Mn is minor than 

the values of Ni and Cu (for example, 10% of Mn compared to 10000 ppm of Ni).

for the LA-ICP-MS data with the scores of each Principal Component. Total variance explained by the 

two components together is 98.8%. 

The statistical analyses reflect the pattern observed in the chemical composition 

of nodules studied, in which Mn, Ni and Cu are enriched in the nodules from the CCZ 

and CIB, whereas Fe, Co and Ti are enriched in nodules from the MB and coated 

pebble from the RGR.

6. DISCUSSION 

6.1. Mechanisms of formation of polymetallic nodules 

The nodules studied present similarities regarding their morphology and 

geochemistry, which give insights into the mechanisms of formation common to all the 

nodules.  

Distinguishable concentric layers and high standard deviation of the elements 

concentration reveal that the accretion process does not happen always in the same 

way and at the same rate. The Mn/Fe ratio high variance indicates that the conditions of 

formation of nodules changed many times. Dymond et al. (1984) first evinced that the 

accretion process in nodules from the Equatorial Pacific Ocean is characterized by non-

steady-state process. 

The chemical composition is basically the same in all the nodules and is 

represented by 41 chemical elements from the dataset in this work, from Si to U (see 

Supplementary Material) recognized with a combination of different analytical 

techniques.  

Mn and Fe are the dominant elements as usually occurs in nodules, once Mn and 

Fe oxides are the matrix material (HEIN; KOSCHINSKY, 2014). This seems to be true 

for the global ocean, including the recently recovered nodule from the Rio Grande Rise 

(this work). 

Si, Ca and K are also found in high abundance in the nodules studied. However, 

Principal Component Analysis shows these elements are associated neither to the Mn 

mineral phase nor to Fe one. Si and K are known to come from detrital aluminosilicates, 

while Ca, Ba and Sr come from  pelagic biogenic material. Both groups make up a 

detrital mineral phase incorporated during the nodules accretion (GLASBY; LI; SUN, 

2013; HEIN; KOSCHINSKY, 2014). Finally, most of the trace metals (Cu, Ni, Co and Ti) 

can be split into those associated to the Mn mineral phase and those that are 

associated to the Fe one (see the PCA results, figure 35 and 36). This segregation is in 

agreement with many previous findings which show that some metals are preferably 

incorporated into the Mn oxide while others are incorporated into the Fe oxyhydroxide 

structure. Strong positive correlation between Mn and Ni, Cu and Zn was found in 

nodules from the CIB (PATTAN; PARTHIBAN, 2011). Mn oxides have the tendency to 

incorporate divalent cations like Ni
2+

, Cu
2+

 and Zn
2+

, whereas Fe oxyhydroxide tend to 



64 
 

incorporate anionic species like HPO4
2-

, HAsO4
2-

, HVO4
2-

, MoO4
2-

 and WO4
2-

, as well as 

REE and Co
3+

 (GLASBY; LI; SUN, 2013).  

It was not possible to evaluate the association between Fe and the REE because 

of the limitation on the LA-ICP-MS technique in not distinguishing Fe. Nevertheless, the 

most REE-enriched nodules correspond to the ones with higher Fe content and low 

Mn/Fe ratio, which are the ones from the Mascarene Basin and the Rio Grande Rise. 

These nodules are comparable to the hydrogenetic nodules of Cook Islands, which 

present high REE content (HEIN et al., 2015). 

Most of the Mn oxide present in the nodules from the basins studied are 

composed of a mixture of Mn
4+

 and Mn
3+

, revealing a high oxidation state for Mn. 

Glasby (2006) estimated that 98% of the Mn in deep sea nodules is Mn
4+

. This is in 

agreement with the oxidation state of Mn in the three main Mn oxides present in 

nodules, namely vernadite, todorokite and birnessite (BURNS; BURNS, 1977). Mn
2+

 

has also been found incorporated to lattice vacancies of phyllomanganates when the 

Mn
2+

 upwards diffusion across the redox front is too high, but this chemical species was 

not found to be relevant in none of the samples measured in this study. 

The presence of Mn species in the sediments comes from the organic matter 

diagenesis, in which Mn is reduced to Mn
2+

 and is released to the pore water in the 

suboxic sediment layer, together with Ni
2+

, Cu
2+

 and Zn
2+

 (CHESTER, 2003). Mn
2+

 then 

migrates to the oxic layer by diffusion and is oxidized to Mn
3+

 and Mn
4+

, precipitating as 

phyllomanganates, which incorporate Ni
2+

, Cu
2+

 and Zn
2+

 in their lattice vacancies 

(GLASBY, 2006). Suboxic diagenesis precipitation of Mn may happen and results on a 

high flux of Mn
2+

 into the Mn oxide structure (DYMOND et al., 1984; WEGORZEWSKI; 

KUHN, 2014). The suboxic diagenesis nodules accretion occurs when the redox front is 

closer to the sediment-water interface, where the nodules are generally found. Suboxic 

diagenesis results Mn/Fe ratios up to 500 and low Ni and Cu contents (BLÖTHE et al., 

2015). Such conditions were not observed in the nodules studied, thus this process 

seems to be not relevant for the formation of the nodules considered in this study.  

Fe is present in nodules generally as oxyhydroxides FeOOH (MARCUS et al., 

2015). However, hematite (Fe2O3) was found in small content in nodules (SHIRAISHI et 

al., 2016). Also, oxyhydroxides can change into hematite by dissolution and re-

precipitation, or by solid state transformation (LU et al., 2011). Therefore, the presence 

of Fe2O3 in some of the nodules may be explained by transformation of oxyhydroxides 

into hematite. 



65 
 

Based on the above considerations, oxic diagenesis and hydrogenetic accretion 

are possibly the dominant processes of formation for the nodules studied.  

 

6.2. Characterization of the formation process in the different ocean 

basins  

The morphological and geochemical features of the nodules from the CCZ are 

similar to those of the nodules from the CIB, while the nodules from the MB are similar 

the coated pebble from the RGR (table 13 and figure 37). 

The relative elemental abundance is different for each ocean region. Cu and Ni 

are enriched in nodules from the CCZ and the CIB. On the other hand, Co and Ti are 

enriched in nodules from the MB and coated pebble from the RGR. It is not coincidence 

that this happens where the Mn/Fe is &amp;lt;1. This information corroborates the idea that 

diagenetic deposits are enriched in Mn, Cu, Ni, Zn and Mo, while hydrogenetic deposits 

are enriched in Fe, Co, Ti and REE (HEIN; KOSCHINSKY, 2014).

elements for each nodule. 

Nodules from the CCZ fall into the mixed type category, according to the 

classification of Halbach et al., (1981). The discoidal shape and different surface texture 

on the top and bottom sides are in agreement with the model of growth by which 

diagenetic formation occurs in the buried side of the nodule, while hydrogenetic 

formation occurs at the exposed side. Besides, the thicker recent oxide layer 

corresponds to the rough side and the thinner to the smooth one. The diagenetic 

accretion process is known to happen at least one order of magnitude faster relative to 

hydrogenetic accretion (DYMOND et al., 1984), resulting in thicker layers in the buried 

side of nodules. 

The chemical composition reflects some asymmetry between the top and the 

bottom side of the CCZ nodules too. It is possible to observe slight differences 

regarding the profiles of the Mn-Cu and Ti-REE pairs, which clearly vary in opposite 

ways in the bottom side of the nodule and are not observed in the top side.

Wegorzewski and Kuhn (2014) describe the Mn – Fe fractionation as a result of metals 

release due to the decomposition of organic matter within the sediments into the oxic 

pore water.  

Ti and REE abundances occur with the same order of magnitude at both the top 

and the bottom side of the nodules from the CCZ, which can be explained by diffusion 

of the seawater into the first centimeters of sediment pore water. The metals released 

during Mn reduction in the suboxic layer, however, may not reach the seawater when 

migrating upward, or, if they do so, the dilution effect will be higher comparatively to the 

one expected for metals diffusing downward as the seawater penetrates into surficial 

sediment pore water. This mechanism explains why the Mn/Fe ratio variation occurs in 

the bottom side but not in the top side of the nodule exposed to seawater. 

Thus, we can assume that the bottom side of the nodules- in contact with the 

sediment – undergoes metal precipitation under oxic diagenesis, while the top side – in 

contact with the seawater – is undergoes hydrogenetic metal precipitation, as illustrated 

by figure 38.  

The overall geochemical composition of the CCZ nodules is characterized by 

higher Ni and Cu contents in comparison to Co and Ti, as well as a higher Mn content 

relative to Fe. Also, the REE concentration is &amp;lt;500 ppm, much lower than the one in 

nodules from the MB and coated pebble from RGR. This geochemical fingerprint of 

nodules indicates a weak hydrogenetic component.  

The existence of nodules with no apparent nucleus was reported by Halbach et 

al. (1981), for what they give the explanation that the internal part of these nodules is a 

former nodule functioning as adsorption surface for more recent concretions. They 

associate these occurrences to the mixed type nodules in which nuclei are 

predominately composed of broken fragments of old nodules, mainly nodule debris of 

hydrogenetic nodules, which seems to be the case for the nodules from the CCZ 

studied. However, the inner portion of the CCZ nodules is much more likely to result 

from diagenetic accretion, which can be deduced by both chemical and morphological 

aspects. In these layers, the Mn/Fe ratio varies from 3 to 40 but it is never &amp;lt;1, Ni and 

Cu are highly abundant and bright, thick Mn-rich layers alternate with dendritic, Mn-

poorer layers. Fragments of marine plankton are very common inside of the diagenetic 

massive layers and are not observed in the other layers, as also reported by Halbach et 

al. (1981).   



68 
 

In fact, the Mn/Fe ratio generally greater 10 (as high as 70) of the nodular nuclei 

from the CCZ nodules is characteristic of the suboxic diagenesis accretion described by 

Dymond et al. (1984). However, these authors associate the high Mn content to high 

flux of Mn
2+

 from organic matter regeneration within the sediment, so that Ni
2+

 and Cu
2+

 

would not be incorporated into the Mn oxide structure, resulting in a low Ni and Cu 

content. This is not found in the study, because high Ni and Cu contents are associated 

to high Mn/Fe ratios. Still, the Mn specie prevailing is Mn
4+

 and Mn
3+

 and not Mn
2+

. 

Therefore, oxic diagenesis is more likely to have occurred. 

 

Figure 38 scheme of the mixed-type nodules from the Clarion-Clippertone Zone environment of 
formation. 

The nodules from the CIB do not present the same external asymmetry observed 

for the nodules from CCZ. They are not discoidal, nor do they present a rim separating 

two different surface textures between exposed and buried sides.  

Massive and dendritic layers are the main textures observed in the CIB nodules, 

which together with their spherical and spheroidal shapes and rough surface texture 

indicate a common diagenetic origin (HALBACH et al., 1981). Besides, Mn/Fe ratios &gt; 5 

and high Ni and Cu abundances relatively to Co and Ti confirm that they belong to the 

diagenetic type category (HALBACH et al., 1981). Still, the REE content in these 

nodules is &amp;lt;500 ppm, low in comparison to the MB nodules and RGR coated pebble 

and close to the CCZ ones. 



69 
 

The strong alternation of layer textures and variable Mn/Fe ratio indicates high 

environmental variability. Similarly to the CCZ nodules, the Mn-rich layers are enriched 

in Ni and Cu, while the few layers where Mn/Fe is lower (&amp;lt;5) are poorer in these two 

elements and a slight rise in Co and Ti is noticed. Layers like this second case may 

represent a period of time when the nodules were subject to more oxic conditions.  

Hydrogenetic accretion is not likely to have occurred in the CIB nodules, since 

Mn/Fe ratios do not reach 1 in the oxide layer. Also, the columnar layer texture that is 

typical of this type of accretion (HALBACH et al., 1981) is not present. So the presence 

of low Mn/Fe layers is explained by exposure to oxic pore water rather than by direct 

exposure to seawater (hydrogenetic accretion), resulting on oxic-diagenetic precipitated 

Fe-rich Mn layers (DYMOND et al., 1984). The oxic pore water entrains metals from the 

seawater (Fe, Co, Ti, REE) but still contains high content of Mn cations because of the 

reaction with sediment particles (oxic diagenesis). In another stage of growth, however, 

this Mn flux from diagenesis was possibly higher, resulting in the high Mn/Fe, Ni and 

Cu, and in massive layers, as illustrated by figure 39. This seems to have happened 

more than once in all the studied nodules from the CIB.  

Nevertheless, this process seems to have happened differently between the two 

nodules (AAS21-19 and SS4-280) because of their level of internal symmetry. Nodule 

AAS21-19 is asymmetric internally, while SS4-280 is highly symmetric. Nodule SS4-280 

high symmetry indicates that despite the accretion process variated during the nodule 

growth, it happened in the same way and velocity all around the nodule. Much of the 

asymmetry of AAS21-19 can be explained by the presence of multiple nucleation 

centers. 

This work suggests that the nodules from the CIB were formed buried within the 

first centimeters of oxic sediment where, moment of higher flux of metals from the 

seawater diffused to the pore water, alternated with moments when higher organic 

matter input released more diagenetic-sourced metals (figure 39).

Figure 39 Condition of formation of oxic-diagenetic nodules from the Central Indian Basin conditions of 
formation. (A) in the case of low sedimentation of organic matter and (B) in the case of high 

sedimentation of organic matter. 

The nodules from the Mascarene Basin are very different from the ones 

discussed until now. Their morphology is very consistent with those of the nodules ruled 

solely by hydrogenetic concretion described by Halbach et al. (1981). 

Looking into the interior of the nodules, the microstructures also seem to be 

compatible with the Halbach et al. (1981) classification. The nodules from the MB, 

hydrogenetically formed, present regular and closely packed fabric with columnar 

patterns, which reflects the exterior surface causing the finely grained smooth texture. 

The variable degree of reflectiveness power is due to variable abundance of Mn in the 

hydrogenetic material.  

The geochemical aspects of the nodules from the Mascarene Basin are very 

distinct from the CCZ and CIB. They are typical polynodules from slopes and 

seamounts vicinity (HEIN et al., 2015). The relative elemental composition also reflects 

the hydrogenetic formation, as the Fe content of these nodules is higher and the Mn/Fe 

is generally &amp;lt;1. The low Ni and Cu content and higher Co and Ti content are in 

agreement with those expected for hydrogenetic accretion. Also, the Rare Earth 



71 
 

Elements content is &gt; 1000 ppm, twice higher than the previous nodules. Despite the 

hydrogenetic signature of nodule SK35-24, its shape is not spheroidal because of its 

nucleus shape.  

Nodules from the MB have been studied before by Nath and Prasad (1991), who 

also reported spheroidal 2 - 4 cm nodules with smooth surface texture, ?-MnO2 

dominant mineral, enriched in Fe, Co and REE and depleted in Mn, Ni and Cu. Two 

main mineral groups were found: (1) Ca, Fe, Mn, Co and Ti (hydrogenetic); and (2) Al, 

Si, K, Mg, Na and Cu (detrital) (NATH; PRASAD, 1991). Top-bottom fractionation was 

obliterated to what Nath et. al 1992 explained by the nodules turn-over. They observed 

more REE-enriched and ?-MnO2-rich nodules in the western Indian Ocean and 

shallower depth in Central Indian Basin. They found strong correlation between Ca, Fe 

and REE and attributed the REE to be incorporated by the Fe oxyhydroxide phase. 

However, neither of the two studies investigated the chemical composition with spatial 

resolution as the present study does. 

The high similarity all around the nodules indicates that the accretion did not vary 

much over the time, i.e. metal source and the rate of accretion. The fractionation 

between Mn-rich and Fe-rich layers does not occur in the MB nodules, or it occurs in 

such a small scale that it is not possible to identify. Their geochemical composition is 

more homogenous regarding all the chemical elements. 

The small size may be related to their general lower growth rate in comparison to 

the other types, which explains also the low thickness of the internal layering. Their 

roundness is still little understood, as some authors hypothesize about a rolling 

movement because of bottom currents but no evidence exists that the bottom current 

would be able to move the nodules constantly. Also, the rolling movement would be 

expected to occur in the entire nodule accretion time in order to give those perfect 

concentric layers over the time. But from our observation, nodules attach together and 

this would have required an interval of no movement long enough to the attachment to 

happen (figure 40).  

Nodules from red clay sediments have been found to be hydrogenetically in 

origin (PATTAN; PARTHIBAN, 2011). However, the shape of the nodules from the MB 

points to an exposed growth environmental set where they can eventually roll. 

 



72

(A) before and (B) after the nodules become attached. 

Finally, the investigation of the coated pebble from the RGR, even though it is 

only one, reveals interesting facts about the environmental conditions from that region. 

Relying on its morphological and geochemical aspects it is possible to predict 

environmental conditions closer to the MB instead of the CCZ and the CIB for the RGR.  

In fact, it has been mentioned above already that small and spheroidal smooth 

surface texture nodules are typical from slopes and seamounts vicinity and into the 

hydrogenetic genetic type. The abundance of well-preserved carbonate microfossils 

upon the nodules surface is a reliable hint that it is from a rise indeed, as carbonate 

shells would not be found well-preserved bellow the Carbonate Compensation Depth. 

The planktonic foraminiferal lysocline – the depth below which the tests began to suffer 

dissolution - is around 4050 m in the RGR (MELGUEN; THIEDE, 1974). 

The RGR fits into the environmental set expected for this type of nodules. 

Besides, the sole nodule studied reflects a hydrogenetic ruled accretion type also 

geochemically. Its Mn/Fe ratio value is &amp;lt;1 and the Ni and Cu abundance is low is 

comparison to Co and Ti. Also, the REE is the highest found among the nodules 

studied, being &gt; 2800 ppm. 

The morpho-geochemical fingerprint of the RGR coated pebble is compatible 

with what is expected to the environmental set, comparable to the figure 40. Besides, 

nodules from the Brazilian Basin and the western South Atlantic Ocean as whole have 

been showed to be dominantly hydrogenetic in comparison with the eastern South 

Atlantic and even the Walvis Ridge system, which is also a seamount (XAVIER, 1982; 

KASTEN et al., 1998). 



73 
 

The presence of highly contrasting layers with inverse correlation between Mn 

and Fe - as well as their companion elements Cu-Ni and Co-Ti-REE respectively - 

within the diagenetic and mixed type nodules from the CCZ and CIB in comparison to 

more homogenous layers with absent inverse correlations within the hydrogenetic Fe-

Mn oxides from the MB and RGR is the important question.  

It is suggested to be the result of the redox front close to the nodules location in 

the sediment. Slight changes in the redox front up or downward define the availability of 

metals for the nodules. Namely, it defines if exist a strong diffusion from the seawater to 

the sediment or if exist a strong influence of metals coming from enhanced organic 

matter diagenetic reaction in the suboxic layer. The redox front dictates the location of 

the main geochemical reactions within the sediments, mainly the ones responsible for 

the organic matter diagenesis.  

The hydrogenetic Fe-Mn oxides from the MB and RGR, in the other hand, are 

entirely columnar and the inverse correlation between Mn and Fe is absent, as well as 

between the other elements. Variation of Cu solely occurs in the nodules from the MB, 

but it is not followed by Mn neither by Ti, which means that Cu varies for some other 

reason that is not the redox potential. This class of nodules form upon hard substrate 

entirely expose to the seawater in oxic environment. In this case there is no sediment 

pore water, thus no diagenetic reaction occurs.  

As final consideration of the discussion section, this work reached its objectives. 

The nodules studied are in agreement with previous characterizations of the deposits 

already described (CCZ, CIB and MB). Also, further aspects were studied in this work 

adding to the previous description. A first characterization of a Fe-Mn oxides coated 

pebble from the RGR is presented. 

The variable Mn/Fe ratio previously observed in the nodules from the CCZ was 

found to happen also in the CIB bit not in the MB and RGR. This enables for a 

generalization that this process happens only in the diagenetic and mixed-type nodules 

and is not detected in the hydrogenetic nodules. Since both diagenetic and mixed-type 

nodules form at unconsolidated sediments basins, the presence of the redox front 

seems to play the major role in the existence of the fractionation process, whereas the 

redox front is not present in the environment of formation of the hydrogenetic nodules. 

Those nodules in which the Mn – Fe fractionation happens correspond to the ones with 

the most complex layer texture alternation (dendritic, massive and botryoidal), so the 

morphology is a good indicator of the nodules genesis.

7. CONCLUSIONS 

The polymetallic nodules from the four ocean regions studied exhibit common 

characteristics and are formed fundamentally by the same two process, the oxic 

diagenetic and the hydrogenetic accretion of Mn and Fe oxides. However, the nodules 

differ regarding which of these processes rule the growth processes, revealed by the 

morphological and geochemical. Polymetallic nodules from the Clarion-Clippertone 

Zone and the Central Indian Basin are dominantly formed by oxic diagenesis, whereas 

the ones from the Mascarene Basin and Rio Grande Rise are hydrogenetic. 

Also, the accretion process was not constant during the nodule growth, as 

revealed by heterogeneous morphology and geochemistry of layers mainly in the 

diagenetic and mixed-type nodules. In these nodules, the Mn/Fe ratio is highly variable, 

as well as the metals which are associated to them. The redox front influences 

unconsolidated sediments, where this type of nodules form, and variances on its depth 

is suggested as the main responsible. Hydrogenetic nodules form over hard rock or oxic 

unconsolidated sediment and the metals come from the water column solely. 

The morphology itself reflects the Mn and Fe fractionation and may be used as 

an indicative of the environment of nodule formation, whether within the sediment layer 

or exposed to seawater.
