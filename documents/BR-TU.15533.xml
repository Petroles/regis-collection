Acknowledgements 
 

The completion of this master thesis has been much more than analysing data and 

writing an ordinary dissertation, it has been an opportunity to get involved in the world of 

permafrost research and polar science.  

 

I would like to thank my supervisor, Professor Gonçalo Vieira, for trusting me for the 

development of this research and for giving me the chance to discover the beautiful area of 

Cierva Point to collect the data in-situ. Stepping in “the end of the world” and getting in 

contact with the Antarctic territory allowed me to better understand the importance of 

monitoring the impacts of climate change in such sensitive environment and empowered my 

motivation to carry out this study. 

Many thanks to Gabriel Goyanes, who accompanied me on the journey and supported me in 

every adventure working on field. Without his patience, Antarctic experience and drone pilot 

skills, I would not have been able to get all the fundamental data indispensable to carry out 

this work. 

Special acknowledgments to the Portuguese Polar Program 2017/18 (PROPOLAR) for 

funding this research and facilitating the logistics that make possible the larger scale project 

about “Permafrost and Climate Change in the Antarctic Peninsula” (PTDC/AAG-

GLO/3908/2012 – FCT, Portugal). Also, to Ana Salomé for all the support provided during 

my trip to Antarctica and for her great skills to handle any kind of incident.  

Thanks as well to the project “Impact of Recent Climate Warming on Active-Layer 

Dynamics, Permafrost, and Soil Properties on the Western Antarctic Peninsula” (ANT-

6900673) from the National Science Foundation (USA), in which the boreholes used in this 

work were installed. On the framework of this project, Prof. James Bockheim and Dr. Kelly 

Wilhelm provided the shallow borehole data for the years from 2012 to 2014.   

Always thankful with my father, Miguel Ramos, who introduced and guided me on my first 

steps into the world of polar sciences, with the passion and enthusiasm of who devoted his life 

to the research in Antarctica. Thanks as well to my mum, the one that stands my anxiety and 

always have the magic words to keep me calm in the most stressful situations. 

 

Finally, yet important, thanks to all my colleagues, teachers and friends that helped me during 

the last two years, either with advice, knowledge or encouragement.

Abstract 

The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) has shown complex reactions to climate change in 

the last decades. To evaluate the changes occurring in these environments, permafrost and 

active layer monitoring and modelling are essential. In this dissertation, the characteristics of 

the ground temperature regime are analysed and the spatial distribution of the “Temperature at 

the Top of Permafrost” (TTOP) in Cierva Point (Danco Coast, WAP) is estimated using topo-

climatic information over an area of 0.65 km2. With the results, the climate sensitivity of 

permafrost in this area and the potential impact of small climate change in its extent are 

evaluated. 

 

A first evaluation of the temperature regimes allowed to determine the temperature and depth 

of the permafrost table and the ground thermal offset using observed borehole and climate 

data from nine different monitoring sites, in selected periods from 2012 to 2018.  The top of 

permafrost was observed at depths of 0.4, 1 and 5m and the temperature at these depths was 

observed to be -1.4 ºC, -2.6 ºC and 1.2 ºC in these locations. For the monitoring boreholes 

where the top of permafrost was not reached, the depth of the top of permafrost was estimated 

to range between 0.4 and 5 m with temperatures ranging between -0.2 ºC and -2.6 ºC. 

 

The results were used together with topographic data to implement the spatial TTOP model 

using a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based methodology to implement a high-

resolution model (1 x 1 m grid cell) that allows a further insight into the spatial characteristics 

of permafrost.  

Permafrost was estimated to be present in nearly 88% of the area and the lower TTOP values 

were found at high altitudes and unconsolidated soil or peat areas covered by moss. The 

highest TTOP results were found at low altitudes, bare surfaces and concave areas. Bare 

surfaces increase exposure to solar radiation during the summer and the concavity of the 

terrain promotes higher snowpack accumulation during the winter, which acts as a good 

thermal insulator hindering ground energy loses. 

In the areas where the mean temperature at the top of permafrost was found to be higher than 

0 ºC, permafrost is absent and the TTOP stands for the temperature at the base of the seasonal 

freezing layer.

An increment of the TTOP was observed in case of a hypothetical long-term increase of 1 ºC 

in the MAAT and the results suggest the disappearance of nearly 50% of the current modelled 

permafrost area. Ground temperatures resulted to be more sensitive to the temperature 

increment at bare ground surfaces and/or concave sites. The less sensitive areas were the ones 

covered by moss formations as well as the most convex. 

Permafrost degradation in Cierva Point, which is an Antarctic Specially Protected Area, may 

lead to significate impacts in the local ecosystem.

Resumo 

Durante as últimas décadas, a região ocidental da Península Antártica manifestou reações 

complexas às mudanças climáticas e as suas causas ainda não foram completamente 

compreendidas. Na segunda metade do século XX, foi observada uma tendência de 

aquecimento na Península Antártica. Contudo, a partir do início do século XXI, observou-se 

uma tendência para o arrefecimento em algumas regiões da Península. Com o objetivo de 

avaliar os efeitos destas reações nos ambientes livres de gelo da região, é importante a 

monitorização e modelação do permafrost e da camada ativa. O permafrost é definido como 

solo permanentemente congelado (mantém a temperatura a/ou abaixo de 0 ºC durante pelo 

menos dois anos). A camada compreendida entre a superfície do solo e o topo do permafrost, 

e que congela e descongela sazonalmente, é designada como “camada ativa”.  

Nesta dissertação, são analisadas as caraterísticas do regime térmico do solo em Cierva Point 

(Costa de Danco Coast, Península Antártica Ocidental), numa área com 0.65 km2 e apresenta-

se um mapa da distribuição espacial da Temperatura no Topo do Permafrost (TTOP), usando 

dados topoclimáticos observados e modelizados. Com os resultados, é avaliada a 

sensibilidade climática do permafrost e o potencial impacte que mudanças na temperatura 

média anual poderão causar na sua extensão. 

 

Inicialmente, foi desenvolvida uma análise do regime térmico do solo em nove locais com 

diferentes caraterísticas usando dados climáticos e de temperaturas do solo observados de 

2012 a 2018 em perfurações instaladas na área de estudo. Esta análise, permitiu a 

determinação da espessura e da variabilidade interanual da camada ativa, da temperatura e 

profundidade do topo do permafrost, e finalmente, do offset térmico do solo (diferença de 

temperatura entre a superfície do solo e o topo do permafrost) nestes nove locais. O topo do 

permafrost (TOP) foi encontrado em três dos nove locais com diferentes caraterísticas a 0,4, 1 

e 5 m de profundidade e com temperaturas de -1.4 ºC, -2.6 ºC e 1.2 ºC, respetivamente. 

Contudo, os dados mostraram que a presença de permafrost é possível em oito dos nove 

locais, embora a profundidades maiores que aquelas de algumas perfurações, que apenas se 

encontram na camada ativa. As temperaturas no topo do permafrost estimadas nestes nove 

locais variam entre -0,2 ºC e -2,6 ºC. Em geral, o topo do permafrost foi observado a maior 

profundidade em locais com afloramentos rochosos, seguindo-se os depósitos não 

consolidados e os substratos orgânicos formados por musgos.

Os resultados da análise do regime térmico foram utilizados, em conjunto com dados 

topográficos, para a implementação de um modelo espacial da “Temperatura no Topo do 

Permafrost” (TTOP) em toda a área de estudo, usando uma metodologia baseada nos 

Sistemas de Informação Geográfica (SIG). Para a implementação do modelo TTOP, foram 

determinadas relações estatísticas entre os fatores topográficos e os parâmetros que 

constituem o modelo usando como base os dados observados nos nove locais. O software 

SPSS Statistics 25 foi o utilizado para estimar as correlações estatísticas entre fatores 

topográficos e parâmetros observados e para determinar as relações matemáticas existentes 

entre eles. Mais tarde, as relações estatísticas encontradas foram espacialmente computadas 

sob a área de estudo mediante o software ArcMap 10.4, e finalmente aplicou-se a equação do 

modelo sob a área de estudo completa. 

 

O resultado foi um modelo TTOP de alta resolução (1 m) que oferece pela primeira vez uma 

perspectiva da distribuição espacial do permafrost em Cierva Point. Os resultados do modelo 

TTOP ilustram os valores mais baixos (até -6.2 ºC) em solos orgânicos ou pouco consolidados 

cobertos por musgos e em altitude, do que em áreas de menor altitude de rocha nua, húmidas 

e em terrenos côncavos 

Os valores da Temperatura no Topo do Permafrost modelizada mais elevados (superiores a 0 

ºC e até 3,5 ºC), encontraram-se em áreas mais baixas, húmidas e com topografia côncava. 

Nestas áreas, os valores resultantes representam, efetivamente, a temperatura na base do solo 

gelado sazonal.  

 

Embora a profundidade do topo do permafrost seja desconhecida, os resultados mostram que 

o permafrost deverá estar presente em 88% da área de estudo, estando ausente especialmente 

em setores com solo nú em altitudes inferiores a 120 m e com topografia côncava. 

O modelo espacial desenvolvido foi ainda usado para identificar a potencial sensibilidade do 

permafrost face a um cenário hipotético de aumento da temperatura média anual do ar de 

longo prazo de 1 ºC, considerando estáveis os restantes fatores como a precipitação, a neve, a 

humidade do solo, a distribuição dos musgos, etc. Os resultados indicam um significativo 

aumento na temperatura no topo do permafrost, correspondendo a um valor médio de +1.2 ºC, 

e o possível desaparecimento das condições para a manutenção do permafrost em cerca de 

50% da área com permafrost na atualidade. A área com permafrost, ficaria então reduzida a 

cerca de 43% da área de estudo. Os setores mais sensíveis a esta mudança de temperatura são 



  

XIV 

 

as áreas localizadas a menor altitude, caraterizadas por superfícies nuas e/ou elevados valores 

de concavidade topográfica. As áreas menos sensíveis ao impacte do aumento de temperatura 

são as com cobertura de musgos, pois estes atuam como isolante térmico, assim como as áreas 

com topografia convexa. 

 

A dinâmica do permafrost é especialmente importante em Cierva Point, que é uma Área 

Especialmente Protegida no quadro do Sistema do Tratado para a Antártida (ASPA), devido à 

presença de uma colónia de pinguins Gentoo, assim como de coberturas de líquenes e 

musgos. A redução da área com permafrost poderá influenciar significativamente o 

ecossistema local, pelos seus impactes na hidrologia e consequentemente, na flora. As 

propriedades impermeáveis do permafrost promovem o escoamento de água nos horizontes 

superficiais do solo ou à superfície, bem como a formação de pequenas lagoas temporárias. O 

descongelamento do permafrost, poderá induzir o aumento da infiltração em profundidade, 

reduzindo a água disponível para a vegetação.

1 Introduction 

1.1 Objectives 

The main objective of this dissertation is to characterize the permafrost in Cierva Point 

(Western Antarctic Peninsula) and evaluate its climate sensitivity by assessing the main 

potential impact of small climate changes in the permafrost extent of this ice-free environment 

area.  In order to achieve this goal, we analysed the area’s ground temperature regime and 

created a GIS-based spatial model of the Temperature at the Top Of Permafrost (TTOP) based 

on statistical relations between certain topographic factors and locally computed TTOP 

parameters from climate observed data. 

This work is included on the larger-scale framework of permafrost research in the ice-free 

terrestrial environments of Western Antarctic Peninsula, which aim to evaluate permafrost 

dynamics and its linkages to recent climate changes through systematic and long-term 

monitoring and modelling of ground and climate properties. The project is conducted by the 

CEG/IGOT team of the University of Lisbon, within the ANTPAS/SCAR expert group. 

 

1.2 An overview of Permafrost and its global significance 

1.2.1 WHAT IS PERMAFROST? 

Permafrost is ground at or below the freezing point of water (0°C, 32°F) for at least two 

consecutive years (Brown et al., 1998). Permafrost forms in cold climates generally distinct 

by long winters without much of snow and short, dry and cold summers. In regions with such 

this climate, some of the ground frozen during the winter will not completely thaw during the 

summer; therefore, a permanent frozen layer will form and continue to grow downward 

gradually each year constituting the permafrost (Péwé, 1979).  

 

Permafrost is distributed on Earth covering great stretches of land at high latitudes and 

altitudes in both hemispheres. In the Northern Hemisphere, permafrost occupies about 24% of 

the exposed land area in the Arctic and sub-Arctic, including large areas in Russia, Alaska and 

Canada. In the Southern Hemisphere, permafrost occurs in most ice-free regions of Antarctica 

(Schaefer et al., 2012; Bockheim et al., 2012). Alpine permafrost may exist at high altitudes in 

much lower latitudes, being present in the high mountains of South America, Central Asia, 

the United States and Europe (Péwé, 1979).

1.2.2 DISTRIBUTION OF PERMAFROST 

Permafrost regions are classified into zones based on its spatial distribution. “Continuous 

permafrost” zones have permafrost underlying 90-100% of the land area; “discontinuous 

permafrost” zones have 50-90% of permafrost; and “sporadic permafrost” around the 10-

50%. “Isolated patches” refer to regions where permafrost underlies less than 10% of the 

land area (Schaefer et al., 2012). Permafrost also occurs subsea on the continental shelves of 

the surrounding continent of the Arctic Ocean and Antarctica. 

In the Northern Hemisphere permafrost occurs almost continuously in large areas, being 

normally absent under lakes and rivers that do not freeze to the bottom (Péwé, 1979). The 

location of the boundary of the continuous permafrost zone variates around the world because 

of regional climate controls. In areas characterized by warmer climates, permafrost occurs 

only in sheltered locations, usually with a north aspect (in the Northern Hemisphere) or south 

aspect (in the South Hemisphere), creating discontinuous, sporadic or isolated permafrost. 

In the Southern Hemisphere, most of the Antarctic continent is overlain by glaciers and liable 

to basal melting (Zoltikov, 1962). The exposed ice-free land of Antarctica is extensively 

underlain with permafrost, some of which is liable to warming and thawing along the 

coastline (Campbell &amp;amp; Claridge, 2009).

hemispheres.

1.2.2 PERMAFROST STRUCTURE AND THERMAL REGIME  

The vertical structure of permafrost is determined by the ground temperatures at different 

depths and is represented in Figure 2.  

When permafrost is present in areas not overlain by ice, it occurs beneath a layer of soil, rock 

or sediment, which freezes and thaws annually, which is called the active layer (Staff, 2014). 

The active layer generally starts thawing in spring after snow melt and may stay thawed until 

autumn, while its maximum depth is reached in late summer. It begins to refreeze in autumn 

with the onset of winter and is completely frozen by late winter or early spring (Schaefer et 

al., 2012). 

The active layer thickness is the annual maximum thaw depth at the end of the summer. It 

depends mainly on the moisture content, being thinner in wet, organic sediments and thicker 

in well-drained gravels or bedrock. Active layer thickness can be less than 30 cm in 

continuous permafrost along the Arctic coast and the Antarctic continent, where values range 

generally from 0.2 to 0.7 m, occasionally with &gt;0.9 m in coastal sites and with very shallow 

active layers (&lt;0.1 m) at high elevation sites (Vieira et al., 2010). The active layer thickness 

usually reaches 2 m or more in discontinuous permafrost of Southern Siberia, and several 

meters in the European Alps and on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (Schaefer et al., 2012). In the 

Antarctic Peninsula, the active layer thickness was found to be greater than 0.9 m on 

monitored sites at unconsolidated materials in the South Shetlands Islands, and around 0.3 m 

in Deception Island (Vieira et al., 2010).  

Under the active layer, permafrost occurs at the depth where the maximum annual 

temperature remains below 0 ºC, and is bounded on the top by the Top of Permafrost (TOP) 

and on the bottom by the Base of Permafrost (BOF) (Schaefer et al., 2012).

The annual variations of air temperature from winter to summer is revealed in the active layer 

and in the few first meters of the permafrost. In this layer, the ground temperature profile over 

a temperature to depth graph (Figure 2), presents three different curves that represent the 

variation of ground temperature with depth. The red curve represents the Maximum Annual 

Ground Temperature (MaxAGT), the dotted line represents the Mean Annual Ground 

Temperature (MAGT) and the Minimum Annual Ground Temperature is represented by the 

blue curve (MinAGT). 

 

The MaxAGT decreases with depth being the depth at which the maximum annual 

temperature reaches 0º C considered the base of the active layer, and the top of permafrost, 

which is known as Temperature at the Top Of Permafrost (TTOP). The point where the red 

curve crosses the ground surface represents the Maximum Annual Ground Surface 

Temperature (MaxAGST). 

The MinAGT increases with depth being and the point where the blue curve crosses the 

ground surface represent the Minimum Annual Ground Surface Temperature (MinAGST). 

The MAGT can either increase or decrease depending on a positive or negative ground 

thermal offset. The thermal offset’s magnitude is the difference between the mean annual 

ground temperature at the top of permafrost and the MAGST, and it depends on the soil 

thermal properties.

The point where the dotted line crosses the surface represents the Mean Annual Ground 

Surface Temperature (MAGST). 

 

Despite the curve of the MAGT being often considered linear for simplification of the 

modelling, Goodrich (1978) showed that the MAGT warming at depth is not linear, but 

offsets to progressively lower values at depth within the active layer (Smith &amp;amp; Riseborough, 

1996). 

 

Under the surface, the seasonal ground temperature signal becomes smaller with depth due to 

the thermal balance between the heat flow from the Earth’s interior and that flowing outward 

into the atmosphere. When the amount of geothermal heat reaching the permafrost equals the 

heat lost to the atmosphere, the permafrost temperature reaches equilibrium and becomes 

seasonally stable at the depth of Zero Annual Amplitude (ZAA) (Péwé, 1979). The 

temperature at the Z depth is known as the Temperature at the depth of Zero Annual 

Amplitude (TZAA).  Because the maximum temperature at the top of permafrost is 0 ºC, no 

significant phase change occurs at lower depths, such that soil thermal properties below the 

active layer remain relatively constant. For practical purposes, the temperature at the top of 

permafrost should be close to the temperature measured at the depth of zero annual amplitude 

(Smith &amp;amp; Riseborough, 1996). 

 

Below the ZAA depth, the temperature of permafrost does not change seasonally, and hence 

this layer is named isothermal permafrost (Delisle, 2007). In the isothermal permafrost layer, 

the temperature increases steadily under the influence of heat from the Earth’s interior until 

overpassing 0 ºC due to the geothermal gradient. This point constitutes the base of permafrost 

(BOP) (Péwé, 1979).  

 
 

1.2.3 CONTROLLING FACTORS IN PERMAFROST: CLIMATE, WATER BODIES, SOLAR 

RADIATION, VEGETATION AND SNOW 

The distribution and thickness of permafrost are directly affected by climate, ground 

properties and geothermal gradient, topography, snow, vegetation and water cover (Péwé, 

2016).

• Air temperature and climate 

Air temperature is the dominant variable controlling global permafrost distribution and 

climate and it directly affects the thickness of the permafrost layer. When the climate warms 

to a mean annual air temperature above 0 °C, the position of the top of permafrost will be 

lowered by thawing. As the climate becomes colder or warmer, the temperature of the 

permafrost respectively rises or declines, resulting in changes in the position of the bottom of 

permafrost. Generally, the colder the climate, the thicker the permafrost layer (Péwé, 2016). 

 

Considering the relation of the ground characteristics with atmospheric temperatures, 

permafrost may be considered as a good indicator of climate sensitivity.  

Seasonal variability in shallow ground temperature reflects variability in air temperature at the 

short-term but becomes increasingly muted with depth. Permafrost temperatures at deeper 

depths reflect variability in climate conditions at longer time scales due to the slow diffusion 

of heat through permafrost. Below the ZAA depth, where the permafrost temperature has no 

seasonal variation, permafrost temperatures reflect long-term climate variations (Schaefer et 

al., 2012). 

 

• Ground properties and geothermal gradient  

The rate at which the base or top of permafrost change depends not only on the magnitude 

of climatic fluctuation but also on the ground’s composition, properties and ice content, since 

these factors determine the ground’s thermal conductivity (Péwé, 2016).  If the mean annual 

air temperature is identic in two different areas, the permafrost layer will be thicker where the 

conductivity of the ground is higher and the geothermal gradient is lower.  

 
• Topography and solar radiation 

The slope and aspect of the ground also influence permafrost formation and active layer 

thickness. South-facing hillslopes in the Northern Hemisphere, as well as north-facing slopes 

in the Southern Hemisphere, receive more incoming solar energy per unit area than other 

slopes and therefore they get warmer. For instance, in the North Hemisphere, permafrost is 

usually absent in the regions of discontinuous permafrost in south facing slopes while shaded 

north facing slopes may develop continuous permafrost (Schaefer et al., 2012) 

 
 



  

7 

 

• Vegetation  

Vegetation and soil organic matter can also influence permafrost formation and active layer 

thickness. 

Their effects often result in large variability in active layer thickness within the space of a few 

meters (Humlum, 1998a). Shading by vegetation and the insulating effect of a thick organic 

layer, reduces the solar energy absorbed by the soil, resulting in shallower active layers than 

bare exposed soil (Shur &amp;amp; Jorgensen, 2007).  

 

• Snow cover 

After the air temperature, local snow thickness and characteristics are the dominant variables 

controlling global permafrost distribution (Schaefer et al., 2012) as they influence heat flow 

between the ground and the atmosphere (Péwé, 2016). Any location with annual average air 

temperatures below freezing can form permafrost (Humlum, 1998b; Stocker-Mittaz et al. 

2002). However, depending on the snow accumulation and other environmental factors, 

permafrost may even be present in regions with mean annual air temperature as high as 2 °C 

or absent where annual average air temperature is as low as -20 °C (Jorgensen et al., 2010).  

Snow is a good thermal insulator as it is composed by air and ice crystals in its volume. This 

fact often results in ground temperatures 5 to 20 °C higher than winter air temperatures and 

permafrost temperatures 3 to 6 °C higher than the mean annual air temperature. Snowpack 

thickness, timing and duration, hence influence ground temperature (Zhang, 2005; Jorgensen 

et al., 2010). 

 
• Water bodies 

Finally, bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, and the sea show a noticeable effect on the 

distribution of permafrost. A deep lake that does not freeze to the bottom during the winter 

will be underlain by a zone of thawed material. Small, shallow lakes that freeze to the bottom 

each winter are underlain by a zone of thawed material, but the thawed zone normally does 

not completely penetrate the surrounding permafrost extent (Péwé, 2016). 

 

1.2.4 TYPICAL LANDFORMS IN PERMAFROST ENVIRONMENTS 

Permafrost processes manifest themselves in large-scale landforms, such as thermokarst 

phenomena, polygonal ground and pingos. In addition, there are many features caused in large 

part by frost action that are common but not restricted to permafrost areas, such as solifluction 

(frost creep and flow) and frost-sorted patterned ground. 



  

8 

 

The main geomorphic features present in permafrost environments are described below 

(Péwé, 2016): 

• Polygonal ground 

One of the most common geomorphic features associated with permafrost is the relief pattern 

on the surface of the ground, usually called “polygonal ground”, or “tundra polygons”. This 

pattern appears with the formation of a network of shallow troughs delineating 3 to 30 m 

diameter polygons and occurs as the result of winter freezing and spring thawing. In winter, 

the soil becomes brittle and cracks due to the contraction in response to cold temperatures. In 

spring, meltwater fills the cracks and consequently freezes forming ice wedges (Dick, 2012). 

Season after season, the cracks and ice wedges increase in diameter and depth. From the air 

perspective, the tundra will show a pattern of cracks looking like honeycombs (Figure 3).  

In many areas of the continuous permafrost zone, drainage follows the troughs of the tops of 

the ice wedges forming the polygons; and at ice wedge junctions, melting may occur to form 

small pools. The joining of these small pools by a stream causes what is known as beaded 

drainage (Figure 4). Such drainage evidences the presence of perennially frozen, fine-grained 

sediments cut by ice wedges (Péwé, 1979).

• Thermokarst 

 
The thawing of permafrost creates thermokarst topography, an irregular surface containing 

mounds, sinkholes, caves, tunnels and steep-walled ravines resulting from the melting of 

ground ice (Péwé, 1979).  

Thawed depressions filled with water are known as thermokarst lakes (Figure 5) and are 

widespread in permafrost regions, especially in those underlain with permanently frozen silt. 

They can appear on hillsides or even on hilltops and are good indicators of ice-rich permafrost 

(Péwé, 1979).

• Pingos 

 
Other landforms linked to permafrost are pingos, which are ice-cored circular or elliptical 

hills of frozen sediments or bedrock. Pingos can reach dimensions up to 60 m high and 450 m 

in diameter. They can occur in the continuous permafrost zone, especially in the tundra. They 

are much less outstanding in the forested area of the discontinuous permafrost zone. 

Frequently they are cracked on top with summit craters formed by thawing massive ice 

(Figure 6) (Péwé, 1979).

Hanne Christiansen (Ingólfsson, 2008). 

 

• Patterned ground 

Intense and repeated freezing and thawing throughout the year produces small-scale patterned 

ground. This phenomenon tends to stir and sort granular sediments, forming circles, stone 

nets, and polygons a few centimetres to 6 m in diameter (Figure 7) (Péwé, 1979). These 

features require a cold climate besides a ground composed by some fine-grained soils 

and high water content, but they do not necessarily need to be underlained by permafrost. 

However, permafrost constitutes a non-permeable substrate that keeps the soil water content 

available for freezing.

Spitsbergen (Hallet, 2013). 

 

 

• Solifluction  

In areas underlain by an impermeable layer of seasonal frozen ground, the active layer is often 

saturated with water and becomes easily deformable. The progressive downslope movement 

of water saturated soil under the action of gravity and frost is called solifluction. This material 

moves in a semifluid condition and results in lobe-like and sheet-like flows of soil on slopes. 

The pattern formed on the ground because of this phenomenon is known as solifluction lobes 

and sheets (Figure 8). An outstanding feature of solifluction is the mass transport of material 

over low-angle slopes (Péwé, 1979).

1.3 Global and regional impacts of permafrost dynamics in a global 

warming scenario 

Permafrost and its dynamics are important components of the cryosphere as well as the Earth 

system as a whole. These dynamics interact with ecosystems and climate on various spatial 

and temporal scales.  

Climate change is expected to have considerable effects above and below ground climate 

being the main reason for the modifications of the structure and distribution of permafrost 

(Schaefer, 2014). The combination of complex permafrost-ecosystem-climate interactions in a 

warming world could exacerbate the overall impacts of permafrost dynamics to the Earth 

system. The feedbacks resulting from these interactions range from local impacts on 

ecosystem processes, to complex influences on global scale biogeochemical cycling (Grosse 

et al., 2016). 

1.3.1 GLOBAL IMPACTS OF PERMAFROST DYNAMICS 

Global concerns on permafrost dynamics are related with the Earth’s carbon cycle. The most 

recent studies investigating the permafrost carbon pool size estimate that 1035 Gt of carbon is 

stored in the frozen organic soil in the northern circumpolar permafrost region (Schuur, 2015). 

The rest of Earth’s biomes, excluding the Arctic and boreal regions, are thought to contain 

around 2,050 Gt carbon. This pool may cause climate impacts at the global scale upon thaw 

and mobilization (Schuur et al., 2015). This is, if permafrost thaws where carbon pools are 

present, the stored carbon may be released in the form of carbon dioxide and methane, which 

are powerful greenhouse gases that would again contribute to an increased rate of warming 

constituting a feedback loop (Schaefer, 2014). 

In Antarctica, permafrost shows lower carbon content and its contribution to greenhouse gas 

fluxes is minor at a global scale (Turner et al., 2009). The contribution of Antarctic 

permafrost might have even the opposite effect than Arctic permafrost because recently 

deglaciated terrain, or areas with a thickening active layer, may function in the intermediate to 

long-term as carbon sinks due to increased biomass from colonization by new plant species 

and microbial communities (Vieira et al., 2010)

1.3.2 REGIONAL IMPACTS OF PERMAFROST DYNAMICS 

Local and regional consequences of changes in permafrost dynamics vary from changes in the 

ecosystem’s vegetation, fauna, hydrology and terrain, to costly infrastructural damages and 

economic costs (Grosse et al., 2016).  

• Ecosystem disturbances: vegetation, hydrology, and fauna.  

Plant life can be supported only within the active layer since growth can occur only in 

soil that is fully thawed for some part of the year. Therefore, plant growth and rooting 

zones are largely restricted to the active layer, since roots cannot penetrate the frozen 

ground beneath (Ullrich, 2016). Because of this, the dominant ecosystems in 

permafrost regions are boreal forests and tundra. Sedges, shrubs, mosses and lichens 

dominate tundra vegetation while evergreen spruce, fir and pine, as well as the 

deciduous larch or tamarack dominate boreal forests.  

In the Arctic, boreal forests occur in the southern regions and tundra up in the north 

(Schaefer et al., 2012). The tundra in Antarctica occurs mainly close to the coastline, 

while cold deserts occur in the mainland and at high altitude (Lopez-Terril, 2014). In 

mountainous permafrost regions, forests dominate at lower elevations and tundra at 

higher elevations (Schaefer et al., 2012).  

Regarding the hydrology and fauna in permafrost regions, permafrost is impermeable 

to water, so rain and melt water accumulate on the surface forming numerous lakes 

and wetlands. These lakes and wetlands are favourable to migratory birds from around 

the world, which use them as summer breeding grounds (Schaefer et al., 2012). 

However, permafrost constitutes also limitations for fauna requiring subsurface 

homes, as building dens and burrows in the frozen ground beneath the surface is often 

harsh. Other species dependent on plants and animals, such as bacteria, have their 

habitat constrained by the permafrost as well. One gram of soil from the active layer 

may include more than one billion bacteria cells. However, the number of bacteria in 

permafrost soil is much lower varying typically from 1 to 1000 million per gram of 

soil (Hansen, 2017).  Permafrost degradation may disturb ecosystems and change 

species composition, modifying wildlife habitats and migration (Schaefer, 2012). 



  

14 

 

The main ecosystem factor affected by degrading permafrost will be the local 

hydrology, which will suffer changes with wetlands and lakes forming in continuous 

permafrost and disappearing in discontinuous permafrost (Smith et al., 2005).  

• Terrain disturbances: Topography and slope stability 

Climate change is expected to increase erosion rates along the Arctic and Antarctic 

coastline (Schaefer, 2012). As much of the structural stability in mountain ranges can 

be attributed to glaciers and permafrost, thawing permafrost in steep mountain terrain 

increases the risk of rock falls and landslides (Harris et al. 2001). Talus and rock faces 

cemented together by ice in mountainous permafrost zones can form rock glaciers that 

creep downhill at velocities of centimetres to several meters per year (Figure 9).  

 

Figure 9. Rock and talus debris flowing downhill in a rock glacier near McCarthy, Alaska 

(photo: Isabelle Gärtner-Roer) (Schaefer et al., 2012). 

 

If temperatures increase, ice on the permafrost will deform more easily of even thaw, 

resulting in an increase of collapse risk, landslides and rock glacier flow (Schaefer et 

al., 2012). 

 

• Infrastructure:  

Thawing permafrost is structurally weak, resulting in foundational settling that can 

damage or even destroy infrastructure as buildings, roads, pipelines, railways, and 

power lines (Figure 10). Infrastructure failure can have dramatic environmental 

consequences, as seen in the 1994 breakdown of the pipeline of the Vozei oilfield in 



  

15 

 

Northern Russia, which resulted in a spill of 160,000 tons of oil, the world’s largest 

terrestrial oil spill (Schaefer et al., 2012). 

Permafrost regions in the North Hemisphere are more vulnerable to damage as it 

counts with more infrastructure and population than the South Hemisphere permafrost 

regions. However, the effect of climate change on subsidence on Antarctica is of 

major concern, particularly in coastal areas with abundant ground ice, since despite the 

small total area of infrastructure in Antarctica, financial investments are substantial 

(Vieira et al., 2010). 

         

Figure 10. Irregular settling due to permafrost thaw destroyed this apartment building in Cherski, Siberia 

(photo: Vladimir Romanovsky, in Schaefer et al., 2012). 

 

The impacts of the permafrost-ecosystem-climate feedbacks mentioned above have 

significantly raised the awareness for this component of Earth’s cryosphere in the view of 

stakeholders, decision makers, and the public over the last few years (Grosse et al., 2016).  

Moreover, although widespread changes to permafrost usually take centuries, the 

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report estimates that “by the mid-21st 

century the Arctic and alpine air temperatures will increase at roughly twice the global rate 

and the area of permafrost in the Northern Hemisphere will decline by 20-35%” (IPCC, 

2007). Additionally, the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP, 2012) suggests 

the depth of thawing could increase by 30-50% by the year 2080.  

In recognition of this importance, permafrost has been added as an Essential Climate Variable 

(ECV) in the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) of the World Meteorological 



  

16 

 

Organization (WMO). Consequently, permafrost now requires broad-scale research and 

systematic observations to support the IPCC and United Nations Framework Convention on 

Climate Change (UNFCC) in their assessments of the state of the global climate system and 

its variability (Grosse et al., 2016).  

 

To understand the status and dynamics of permafrost, the monitoring of ground temperature 

and active layer thickness are needed. Other observations include sample drilling, remote 

sensing to detect changes in land surface characteristics and measurements of surface 

subsidence or heave (Schaefer et al., 2012). 

  

1.4 Global Permafrost Monitoring 

 

The creation of national permafrost monitoring networks was considered by the IPCC as one 

of the key steps to understand the potential impacts of permafrost dynamics in a climate-

changing world affected by global warming (Grosse et al., 2016). 

Currently, there are two global networks to monitor permafrost: the Thermal State of 

Permafrost (TSP) network, which coordinates measurements of permafrost temperature; and 

the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) network, which coordinates 

measurements of active layer thickness in both polar regions as shown in Figure 11. 



  

17 

 

 

Figure 11. Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) network and Thermal State of Permafrost (TSP) 

network distribution (Schaefer, 2014). 

The TSP and CALM networks are the two components of the Global Terrestrial Network for 

Permafrost (GTN-P). The GTN-P was initiated by the International Permafrost Association 

(IPA) to organize and manage a global network of permafrost observations for detecting, 

monitoring and predicting climate change, and was implemented under the GCOS and its 

associated organizations. The IPA currently coordinates international development and 

operation of the TSP and CALM networks for the GTN-P (Schaefer et al., 2012). 

The TSP network measures permafrost temperature using boreholes. Boreholes vary in depth 

from a few meters to a hundred meters and deeper, with a string of temperature sensors at 

multiple depths. Newer boreholes are automated, but manually lowering a single sensor probe 

down a borehole to measure temperature is still common. The oldest boreholes have operated 

since the middle of the 20th century, with several decades of permafrost temperature 

observations. The TSP network includes approximately 1357 boreholes mostly located in the 

Arctic, also includes boreholes in the European Alps, Antarctica and the Qinghai-Tibetan 

Plateau (GNT-P, 2018). 

The CALM network measures active layer thickness or maximum annual thaw either 

mechanically using a probe, or electronically with a vertical sequence of temperature sensors. 

The probe is a metal rod sunk into the ground until it hits the hard top of permafrost. The 

active layer depth is measured on the rod and recorded. To account for high spatial variability, 



  

18 

 

researchers generally probe the active layer on a specified 1 km or 100 m grid. A 252-sites 

network presently exists under the CALM Network (GNT-P, 2018), some of which have been 

measuring active layer thickness since the 1990s (Schaefer et al., 2012).  

Most stations in TSP and CALM are nationally or regionally funded and operated by 

independent research teams. TSP and CALM coverage are limited because installation and 

maintenance costs restrict sites to regions with reasonable access by truck, plane or boat. The 

research teams in the GTN-P have made tremendous progress, but evaluation of overall 

permafrost status in a region or country is still very difficult because of the non-standard 

observations and limited coverage of the TSP and CALM networks, due to a limited and 

irregular funding (Schaefer et al., 2012). Moreover, international collaboration on data 

collection and analysis is still a great challenge to overcome in this advancing scientific 

problem of global concern. The willingness of scientists to share data and to participate in 

data management strategies is as well a crucial requirement for scientific advancement 

(Papale et al., 2012) 

Specially during the International Polar Year (IPY) in 2007-08, the Antarctic region received 

great efforts to increase the spatial coverage of the existing permafrost-monitoring network 

and installing boreholes deeper than the depth of ZAA (Figure 12) all around the continent 

(Vieira et al., 2010). About 350 new boreholes for temperature monitoring were established 

globally and a considerable number of active layer depth observations were collected during 

this year (Biskaborn et al., 2015). Meteorological stations were as well installed close to some 

boreholes in order to evaluate ground–atmosphere coupling (Vieira et al., 2010).  

Efforts of the IPA and the GTN- P at the end of the IPY resulted in reports on the thermal 

state of permafrost in high latitudes and high altitudes which were called the “IPA snapshot” 

and published in a special issue of the journal Permafrost and Periglacial Processes 

(Christiansen et al., 2010; Romanovsky et al., 2010a; Smith et al., 2010; Vieira et al., 2010; 

Zhao et al., 2010).

1.5 Permafrost in Antarctica 

Antarctica, with an area of 14 million km2, is the world’s largest continent, yet exposed 

ground on which permafrost soils occur covers a mere 49,000 km2 (Fox and Cooper, 1994 in 

Campbell &amp;amp; Claridge, 2009).  Despite occupying only 0.36% of the Antarctic region, 

permafrost is present beneath virtually all ice-free terrain, such as the Antarctic Peninsula and 

the Transantarctic Mountains, except at the lowest elevations of the maritime Antarctic and 

sub-Antarctic islands (Vieira et al., 2010). 

 

Existing studies on permafrost and active-layer dynamics in Antarctica were summarized in 

Vieira et al. (2010). However, in the last years, the Antarctic Peninsula has been the ice-free 

region receiving greater permafrost research interest as is one of the areas of the currently 

affected by the greatest air warming (Guglielmin, 2011). 

 

1.5.1 CLIMATE, ECOSYSTEM AND SENSITIVITY TO CHANGE 

The climate of Antarctica embraces the most extreme cold conditions on Earth. Whereas the 

climate is oceanic in the coastal areas of West Antarctica, it is continental in Central and East 

Antarctica. As a rule, temperatures decrease with distance inland. The average winter 

Figure 12. a) Antarctic permafrost monitoring boreholes (pre-and IPY installation) in relation to soil regions

nd b. Transantarctic Mountains; 6. Ellsworth Mountains; 7. Marie Byrd Land; 8. Antarctic Peninsula;

temperatures range around -20°C and -30°C along the coasts and -60°C to -70°C inland on the 

continent (Umweltbundesamt, 2016). The lowest temperature recorded on site (-89.6°C) was 

measured at the Russian research station Vostok in eastern Antarctica in 1983 (Campbell &amp;amp; 

Claridge, 2009).  

The mean annual precipitation over Antarctica averages around 50 mm per year, with less 

falling inland and most in coastal locations. The precipitation normally falls as snow, and 

little is available for direct soil moistening in the continental part of Antarctica because of 

ablation and evaporation (Campbell &amp;amp; Claridge, 2009). 

 

Regarding the ecosystem, the soils in Antarctica have been referred as “Cold Desert Soils” 

(Campbell and Claridge, 1969), with the exception of the ice-free areas of the Antarctic 

Peninsula, where plant life including lichens, mosses and some grasses are more abundant. 

Biodiversity inland in the continent is extremely low, and diminishes with increasing severity 

of climatic conditions. The occurrence of terrestrial biota is sporadic, being found only in very 

small areas where there is enough water, light and warmth, as well as shelter from the wind.  

 

Terrestrial ecosystems in this harsh environment are extremely fragile. A review of the 

impacts of human activities and the susceptibility of the land systems to disturbance was 

carried out for the Ross Sea region (Campbell, 2001), and showed that disturbances from 

human activities are long-lasting. Physical disturbances to the soils could be persistent for 

hundreds of years, or in the most arid zones (where recovery processes are negligible), could 

even be permanent. Chemical contaminations may also persist in the absence of significant 

leaching. Permafrost is equally dramatically and rapidly disturbed when physical disturbance 

takes place. Less clear, however, are the future impacts of global climate change. From the 

1950’s until 1999, a distinct warming trend was observed in the Antarctic Peninsula region, 

while recent data reports a cooling trend in the North of this peninsula and the East Antarctic 

region since then (Turner et al., 2016; Campbell and Claridge, 2006). 

 

1.5.2 PERMAFROST DISTRIBUTION 

Permafrost research in Antarctica has been increasing significantly since Bockheim (1995) 

developed the first permafrost map of Antarctica (Figure 13), proposing that discontinuous 

and continuous permafrost boundaries correspond to mean annual air temperatures of ?1°C 

and ?8°C, respectively. 



  

21 

 

 

 

 

The permafrost table is at greatest depth in the warmer west and northern regions of 

Antarctica, and diminishes in depth inland with increasing latitude and altitude. However, the 

depth of the permafrost table also varies from site to site at small scales because of the local 

differences in the substrate type and in the exposition to solar radiation that varies with 

topographic shading, aspect, snow cover, surface colour and roughness (Campbell and 

Claridge, 2009). 

 

Later on, results obtained during the IPY on the thermal state of permafrost and the active 

layer in the WAP showed the South Shetland Islands near sea-level region, as an area near the 

climatic boundary of permafrost. Permafrost temperatures range from ?0.4 to ?3.1°C along 

the WAP, where the greatest rate of warming (ca. 2.4–3.4 °C) has occurred from 1950 to 2000 

(Bockheim et al., 2013). Therefore, the WAP was reported as the one with the highest 

sensitivity to climate change in the Antarctic continent (Vieira et al., 2010).  

Figure 13. General permafrost distribution map in the Antarctic (modified from Bockheim, 1995). 



  

22 

 

Permafrost temperatures were much lower in continental Antarctica: from the coast to the 

interior and with increasing elevation, they ranged between -13.4 ºC and -18.7 ºC in Northern 

Victoria Land, from -17.5 ºC to -22.6 ºC in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, and down to -23.7 ºC 

in high elevation on Mount Fleming (Ross Island). The snapshot obtained during the IPY 

shows that the range of ground temperatures in the Antarctic is even greater than in the Arctic 

(Vieira et al., 2010).

1.5.3 RELEVANCE OF PERMAFROST RESEARCH IN WESTERN ANTARCTIC 

PENINSULA: A REVIEW.  

Despite the Transantarctic Mountains being the ice-free region of the Antarctic where 

systematic permafrost research has been conducted for the longest time, it was the Antarctic 

Peninsula region receiving greater permafrost research interest and efforts during the IPY in 

2007-08 (Vieira et al., 2010). 

The reason is because, the WAP was considered as “one of the areas of the world currently 

affected by the greatest air warming and provides a unique opportunity to understand the 

impacts of climate change on permafrost and its related ecosystems” (Guglielmin, 2011). 

 

Along the WAP, the mean annual air temperature showed an increment of around 3.4 °C 

during the second half of the 20th century, making the region one of the world's climate 

warming “hotspots” (Vaughan et al., 2003; Turner et al., 2005, 2009). These changes in 

climate were possibly linked to shifts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to the south 

(Böning et al., 2008), which resulted in a 40% decrement in sea-ice coverage in the 

Bellingshausen Sea (Ducklow et al., 2008; Stammerjohn et al., 2008) and in the disintegration 

of ice shelves along the WAP (Cook and Vaughan, 2010). 

However, more recent studies (Turner et al., 2016) found that the warming signal is more 

complex than previously accounted and report a cooling in the north of the Antarctic 

Peninsula since 2000.  

The complexity of the reaction in this region to climate change is still poorly understood. 

Permafrost properties and seasonal thaw-layer dynamics are considered two key indicators of 

climate change in the polar region (Anisimov et al., 1997; Burgess et al., 2000). Therefore, in 

order to evaluate the consequences of climate change in the terrestrial environments 

dominated by the presence of permafrost in the WAP, permafrost and active layer dynamics 

monitoring and modelling is essential. 

 

On one hand, monitoring is possible though the TSP and CALM network of permafrost 

temperature and active layer monitoring sites set up in some areas of the WAP.  

Especially during the IPY, several national projects focused their efforts in the Antarctic 

Peninsula and led to the installation of new boreholes (see Figure 14a): two intermediate, one 

shallow, 11 surface and 25 under 2m deep ground temperature boreholes. These included 

activities by Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Italy, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Switzerland and the 



  

24 

 

UK (e.g. Ramos et al., 2009 a,b; Ramos and Vieira, 2009; Vieira et al., 2007, 2008, 2009; 

Vieira 2009; de Pablo et al., 2010).  

 

 

Still, during the last decade, after the IPY, the permafrost research activity has kept ongoing 

in the area and the number of boreholes has continued increasing. The data belonging to the 

temperature monitoring in these boreholes has been used for the publication of several papers 

on the characterization of the active layer dynamics and permafrost thermal state in the WAP, 

such as Hauck et al. (2007), Ramos and Vieira (2009), Vieira et al. (2010), Bockheim et al. 

(2013), de Pablo et al. (2014), Wilhelm &amp;amp; Bockheim (2016), Ferreira et al. (2017), Ramos et 

al. (2017).   

Results of these studies show that permafrost temperature ranges from ?0.4 to ?3.1 °C along 

the western Antarctic Peninsula region and the warming rate between 1950 and 2000 ranged 

around 2.4–3.4 °C (Bockheim et al., 2013). This warming has resulted in the continuous 

degradation of permafrost. For instance, reports prior to 1980 showed that permafrost was 

present at a depth of 0.25 to 0.35 m in organic soils near Palmer Station (64°46?S; 64°04?W), 

but currently, permafrost is absent or near thawing in the upper 14 m. In the South Shetland 

Islands, thawing of permafrost has resulted in increases in active-layer thicknesses and in 

thermokarst features such as debris flows and active-layer detachment slides. Several low-

elevation boreholes show the presence of permafrost with temperatures close to 0 ºC, 

especially beneath diamictons or in sedimentary materials. Such is the case at Bellingshausen,

Byers Peninsula or Crater Lake amongst others. On Deception Island, where the substratum is 

of volcano-sedimentary origin with extremely high insulation properties and ice-rich 

permafrost occurs almost down to sea level (Vieira et al., 2010).  

Bedrock temperatures from Hurd Peninsula (Livingston Island) suggest that the continuous 

permafrost boundary is probably at ca. 150 m a.s.l. (Vieira et al., 2009).  

The permafrost was found to be ice-cemented at high altitudes on the WAP. At low 

elevations, sporadic permafrost is especially unstable due to the disequilibrium of the frozen 

bodies with current climatic conditions (Bockheim et al., 2013). The lowest coastal terrain 

near sea level is considered to be essentially permafrost free, but an altitudinal limit for 

continuous permafrost in bedrock has not been identified with confidence (Vieira et al., 

2010). Observed permafrost temperatures and active layer thickness in different points of the 

WAP are shown in Figure 14b and Figure 14c. 

 

In spite of the monitoring expansion efforts and research interest in permafrost in the WAP 

during the last years, due to the scarce of monitoring boreholes in the remotest areas, 

permafrost and active layer dynamics in the WAP is still poorly understood and efforts and 

research here must keep going on to understand its relation with recent climate change. This 

climate changes can have consequences for infrastructure, especially at the low elevations, 

where 25 scientific stations exist in the Antarctic Peninsula region. Warming may also have 

an impact in the sensitive ecosystems of maritime Antarctica (Bockheim et al., 2013).

2 Study Area  

Cierva Point (lat. 64°10’S, long. 60°57’W) is an ice-free peninsula about 1 km long in north 

to south direction and 1.5 km wide in east to west direction, mainly exposed to the north. The 

peninsula (Figure15) stands on the south side of Cierva Cove, located at the north end of 

Hughes Bay in the Danco Coast of Western Antarctic Peninsula. The climate is cold oceanic, 

with a mean annual air temperature of ci. -3 °C, being 4.3 ºC and -20 ºC the maxima and 

minima recorded from 2012 to 2018. The estimated annual precipitation ranges from 400 to 

1100 mm and winter snow depths can exceed 1 m. However, during the summer most of the 

snow in glacier-free areas completely melts (Wilhelm, 2016b). As a result, some temporary 

ponds form at mid-altitudes (Figure 15). 

 

The area taken in consideration in this work is a small sector of the Cierva Point peninsula. It 

covers an area of 0.65 km2, restricted to the ice-free terrain, excluding areas of permanent 

snow accumulations and temporary ponds (Figure 16).

The Cierva Point Peninsula shows a rugged relief that culminates at 340 m elevation in a 

sharp ridge. Most of the peninsula is glacierized with rock outcrops occurring mostly close to 

sea-level on the north side of the peninsula or in its NW tip (Figure 15). Polished bedrock, 

striations, and chatter marks on bedrock throughout the peninsula show the effects of glacial 

erosion on the ice-free areas (Wilhelm, 2016b), while at some locations, recent moraine 

accumulations occur. The northern and lowest elevation sector of Cierva Point is dominated 

by deposits of granite debris and boulders and peat areas covered by significant moss 

(Polytrichum strictum and Chorisodontium aciphyllum) accumulations up to 0.8 m deep 

(Wilhelm, 2016b).  

 

Most deglaciated slopes are north facing showing high solar radiation inputs, especially 

during the summer (Bockheim et al., 2013). Bedrock benches in the north slopes of Cierva 

Point show the presence of unconsolidated materials with soils derived from bedrock 

weathering and from glacial deposits. Slopes vary from 0 to 20% on benches and from 30 to 

60% on bedrock cliffs (Wilhelm, 2016a).

The bedrock in Cierva Point is of intrusive igneous origin. The northernmost area is mainly 

constituted by granodiorites, the middle of the peninsula (uphill and to the south) is 

dominated by feldspar granites and the eastern side, along with the southern peaks, is 

dominated by basalts containing olivine and quartz (Wilhelm, 2016b). 

 

In the NW area of the peninsula, at low elevation close to the shore, stands the Argentinian 

Antarctic Station “Primavera” that supports scientific research (Figure 16) 

Cierva Point is an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) within the Antarctic Treaty as it 

guests a large Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) colony, as well as different types of lichens 

and mosses. The lowest elevations of Cierva Point are characterized by ornithogenic soils due 

to penguin activity.   

 

Several shallow boreholes (1.2-4.3 m) and a deep borehole (15 m) were drilled in Cierva 

Point in 2012 by research teams from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the 

University of Lisbon (CEG-IGOT) in order to monitor the ground temperature at different 

depths. The existing data series from 2012 to 2018, which although discontinuous in some 

boreholes, allows for a very detailed analysis of the ground thermal regime and is an excellent 

data set for modelling the thermal regime and permafrost in the area. 

The borehole data for the period 2012-2014 has been analysed by Wilhelm (2016a) to 

characterize the thickness of the active layer and to model conductive energy transfer in 

different soil types.  

 

However, little is still known about the climate sensitivity linked to regional air and ground 

surface warming in this area. The availability of longer more recent borehole data up to 2018 

presents a good opportunity for modelling the thermal regime and permafrost distribution in 

the region, being them considered as climatically sensitive variables used for determining the 

permafrost thermodynamics in the area and evaluate its impact on ecosystem processes.

3. Methodology 

In order to estimate the temperature and distribution of permafrost, different distribution 

models relying both in statistical and physical approaches have been applied so far in polar 

and mountain regions. Physical-based approaches (Ferreira et al., 2016) have assessed the 

TTOP model using freezing and thawing indexes, n-factors and thermal conductivity of the 

ground, as factors representing ground-atmosphere interactions and providing a framework to 

understand the ground thermal regime and permafrost temperature distribution. Other 

methods have been developed for determining the spatial distribution of permafrost using 

GIS-based empiric-statistical permafrost models (e.g. Etzelmüller et al., 2006). Such 

modelling was calibrated with ground temperature observations, and used non-parametric 

correlations and logistic regression modelling to estimate the spatial permafrost probability 

based on single independent variables (Lewkowicz and Ednie, 2004; Brenning et al., 2005). 

In this investigation, the aforementioned studies, together with others mentioned along this 

dissertation, gave us the insights to create a methodology that allows increment the scarce 

existing knowledge about the permafrost distribution and climate sensitivity of Cierva Point.  

 

The method followed to achieve the objectives of this investigation was divided in two main 

steps.  

Initially, the ground thermal regime of 9 sites with different ground characteristics and 

topographical conditions was analysed. In these locations, ground and air temperature records 

were available from 2012 to 2018, although with significant observational gaps. The ground 

temperature records, taken every 4 hours, were obtained from thermistor strings in boreholes 

with depths ranging from 1.2 m to 15 m. Air temperatures at 4-hour intervals, were measured 

from 7 air temperature sensors and a meteorological station located close to the boreholes. 

Using the ground temperature records, the local ground thermal regime was analysed in the 

different monitoring sites. This allowed to determine the inter-annual variability of the active 

layer, the observed or estimated temperature and depth of the top permafrost and the ground 

thermal offset for each site. Subsequently, the analysis of the air and ground temperatures 

allowed determining the parameters needed to develop the TTOP model for the 9 borehole 

sites.

The outputs of the local ground thermal regime and local parameters were subsequently used 

together with ground, topographic and spatial data as inputs to implement a GIS-based spatial 

TTOP model all over the study area using statistical relations between the inputs.  

The TTOP model predicts the mean annual ground temperature at the depth of the top of the 

permafrost, or the base of seasonal freezing if permafrost is absent, using relatively simple 

parameters representing key climate and terrain factors influencing the ground thermal regime 

(Way, 2016). 

The ground and air temperature data used for the model were obtained from the in situ 

measurements aforementioned. The spatial data used for the elaboration of a digital surface 

model (DSM) that constitutes the base for the spatial modelling, comes from UAV aerial 

imagery and D-GPS control points collected in the field.  

The main software tools used for the development of this methodology were: Excel (for the 

data and thermal regime analysis); SPSS Statistics (for statistical analysis); Pix4D Mapper 

(for the creation of the orthomosaic and DSM through aerial imagery); and ArcMap 10.4 (for 

the spatial model implementation). 

 

3.1 Data Collection and analysis 

3.1.1 GROUND TEMPERATURE MONITORING 

The ground temperature records, measured every 4 hours, were obtained from 9 thermistor 

strings in boreholes with depths ranging from 1.2 to 15 m.  

The boreholes were drilled in the summer of 2012 by a field team of the Universities of 

Wisconsin-Madison and Lisbon and spatially distributed over Cierva Point, as explained in  

Wilhelm &amp;amp; Bockheim (2016). Sites were selected based on different geomorphic ground 

settings. The descriptions of each site are summarized in Table 1 and their spatial distribution 

is shown in Figure 17.  

 



  

31 

 

 

In March 2012, strings containing miniature temperature loggers (iButton, Model DS1922L, 

Maxim Integrated, San Jose, CA) were placed inside the boreholes, cased in sealed, air-filled, 

pvc pipes with an outer diameter of 5 cm. Temperature was recorded every four hours at the 

depths indicated in Table 1. The iButton temperature sensors used in this study (Figure 18a) 

show an accuracy of ±0.5 °C.

Temperatures in the shallow boreholes were recorded until February 2017, with data 

downloaded and the loggers reset at the end of each summer between February and April. 

Unfortunately, the dataset over this period is not continuous, showing several gaps in different 

boreholes at various depths. In February 2017, the thermistors for all the shallow boreholes 

were removed and the thermistors of the deepest borehole (Site1-Permafrost) were replaced 

with a higher accuracy thermistor-chain (GeoPrecision, model M-log5W-DALLAS) (Figure 

18b), being this the only borehole recording ground temperatures up to March 2018.  

The GeoPrecision thermistors show a standard resolution of ±0.065 ºC and an accuracy of 

±0.25 ºC. The sensors were calibrated in an ice-bath following manufacturer instructions and 

the final accuracy was reduced to ±0.1 ºC. 

  

Besides the higher resolution of these sensors, the main advantage of the replacement was the 

possibility of download the data via wifi communication with the thermistors using a 

computer without the necessity of annually extracting the sensors from the borehole, as well 

as the much higher capacity of the memory of the datalogger, allowing hourly measures for a 

period of 5-years and a much higher battery life, lasting up to 3 years without maintenance. 

With these data, we computed and plotted the daily mean ground temperatures over the full 

dataset (Figure 19a). When analysing the mean daily ground temperatures to time curve, we 

observed an abrupt change in Site1 records at all the depths after the thermistor’s replacement 

(Figure 19b) in February of 2017. GeoPrecision thermistors were considered to give closer 

values to real temperatures, as they are more accurate than the iButtons. In order to normalize 

the dataset and correct the abrupt difference in the temperature measurement from 2017, the 

shift value, which was similar at all depths, showing an average of -0.2 ºC, was subtracted to 

the 2012-2017 data. Since the ibuttons had been replaced several times, without other shifts

detected, we assume that the error is due to smaller precision of the ibuttons when compared 

to the Geoprecision device.

Moreover, the dataset was analysed in order to identify and clean outliers due to anomalies or 

sensor manipulation during the data downloading tasks, which were usually found only a few 

days every year, between February and April. 

 

Daily ground temperatures and the gaps in the datasets for each borehole are shown in Figure 

20, evidencing the issues during the 6-year period from March 2012 to February 2018. For the 

analysis, only the periods that included a complete thawing-freezing annual cycle with 

continuous records of air and ground temperatures for all the boreholes were used for the 

analysis of the thermal regimes and TTOP modelling. 

A complete annual air freezing-thawing cycle was defined as per Lewkowicz et al. (2012), 

considering it as the period from the beginning of one year’s autumn (March-April in the 

Southern Hemisphere), when the mean daily air and surface temperatures drop durably below 

0 ºC (freezing period), to the end of next summer (next March-April), after the mean daily air 

and surface temperatures have been durably positive on the cumulative degree-day time 

curves (thawing period). This ensures that the entire cold and warm season is captured in the 

calculation. Dates for thawing and freezing cycles in our specific case study are designated 

later on in next section 3.1.2.

3.1.2 AIR TEMPERATURE MONITORING 

Within a distance of approximately 2 m from each borehole, air and surface temperature 

iButton miniloggers were installed to monitor temperatures at 8 sites (due to the short distance 

between boreholes 7 and 8, just one common air temperature logger was installed). The 

distribution of air temperature miniloggers is represented in Figure 21. 
 

 

The air temperature miniloggers were attached to a pole 1.5m above the surface within a solar 

shield as explained in Wilhelm &amp;amp; Bockheim (2016) and recorded almost continuous data 

from 09/03/2012 to 10/03/2014, when they were removed.  

A meteorological station installed a few meters from the Site1-Permafrost borehole, recorded 

climate data until 25/03/2018. The meteorological station is based in a Campbell Scientific 

CR1000 logger powered by a 12V, 155 amp/hour deep cycle battery and a 90W, 12V solar 

panel (BP590J, BP Solar). It has six instruments recording atmospheric conditions (Wilhelm 

&amp;amp; Bockheim, 2016): an air temperature probe (109-L, Campbell Scientific), a relative 

humidity probe (HMP-45C, Vaisala), a pyranometer (LI200X-L, LI-COR) which recorded 

solar radiation, an anemometer (05103, R.M. Young) which recorded wind speed and 

direction, and a tipping bucket rain gauge (TE525WS, Texas Electronics). In the end of the

summer (between late February and early April) of each season, thermistor data were 

downloaded and the loggers reset.  

The dataset for all the sites was explored in order identify and omit main outliner values due 

to sensor manipulation during the data downloading tasks (usually few days every year 

between February and April). Mean daily air temperature (MDAT) fluctuations and available 

data for each site after the data exploration and correction are shown in Figure 22. 

 

As observed in Figure 22, the dataset for the entire sites except of Site1 is limited to the 

period from March 2012 to March 2014. 
 

The periods determined as complete freezing-thawing annual cycles between 2012 and 2018 

are shown in the PERIOD column of Table 2. However, only years 1 and 2, which are the 

cycles having complete ground and air temperature records (green tick, grey coloured) were 

used for the analysis of the thermal regime and TTOP modelling.  

In site 6, ground temperature records for year 2 are missing, as an exception, only year1’s 

dataset will be used in this site for the computation of the thermal regime and TTOP 

modelling.

3.1.3 AERIAL IMAGERY AND D-GPS GROUND CONTROL POINTS 

For the implementation of a spatial TTOP model, spatial information of the area is mandatory 

to spatialize the model and to derive the terrain and topographic parameters influencing in the 

model’s parameters. Consequently, we built up a Digital Surface Model (DSM) of the area to 

constitute the base for the spatial modelling. UAV aerial imagery and D-GPS ground control 

points collected in the field were processed using Pix4D Mapper software to create a DSM 

and an orthomosaic. 

In late March 2018, we performed seven UAV flights over the study area using a DJI-

Phantom 3 Advanced drone. The flights were carried out at altitudes between 200 and 380 

meters above the sea level and following the flight plans shown in Figure 23, using the 

Android app Pix4Dcapture. The flights provided 1792 aerial images in .jpeg format, with an 

80% overlap, taken by a DJI-FC300S (RGB) camera covering around the 90% of the desired 

area. Some examples of images captured during the flights and are shown in Figure 24. 

Unfortunately, due to a UAV malfunction which led to the loss of the UAV, a small area was 

not surveyed.

Years 1 and 2 are the only thawing and freezing cycles with a complete dataset for both air and ground temperatures (green 

checks, grey shaded). Years 3,4, and 6 have missing data for either ground or air temperature during 30 or more days during 

the freezing/thawing cycle.

These images were processed in Pix4D Mapper for the construction of a high-resolution 

mosaic (i.e. assemblymen of all the images acquired over the area into a single georeferenced 

2D/3D model by computing automated approaches to detect the same features on adjacent 

images).  

In order to improve the geometry and accuracy of the final model, we developed a 

georectification process previous to the mosaic implementation, still in Pix4D. In this process, 

the coordinates of 18 D-GPS control points collected on singular geographical features on the 

terrain were introduced in the software and were manually associated to the exact related 

pixel point on the images. The ground control points were collected using a D-GPS Trimble 

equipment constituted by a GPS rover and receiver Trimble R4 GNSS (in RTK mode) and a 

controller Trimble JUNO T41 Handheld. 

The final Pix4D outputs after the georeferencing and processing were a very high-resolution 

ortophotomosaic and a DSM covering a total land area of 1.063 km2 with a resolution of 6.51 

cm and a mean RMS error of 0.665 m (Figure 25a and b). This RMS error reflects the steep 

slope in such a small area and also limitations associated to the different flight altitudes, 

which originated problems in the DSM reconstruction. 

The raw mosaic and DSM created in Pix4D were afterwards processed in ArcMap 10.4 in 

order to clip them to the restricted area of study of 0.65km2 (avoiding permanent snow cover 

and ponds as shown in Figure 16) and to improve visualization (Figures 26a and b). The 

resolution of the models derived from the DSM is 1 m.

3.2 Analysis of the local ground thermal regimes 

In order to understand the ground thermal regimes and the presence or absence of permafrost, 

it was conducted a graphical and analytic evaluation of the thermal regime for all the 

monitored sites using the observational data available. 

For each borehole, all the parameters that characterize the ground temperature “trumpet 

profile” were estimated (Figure 2): Maximum Annual Ground Temperature (MaxAGT); 

Minimum Annual Ground Temperature (MinAGT); Mean Annual Ground Temperature 

(MAGT), Depth of Zero Annual Amplitude (ZAA), depth at the Top Of Permafrost (TOP),

Temperature at the Top Of Permafrost (TTOP) and Mean Annual Thermal Offset between the 

TOP and the surface (Toffset). 

 

For computing these parameters, the observed ground temperatures of years 1 and 2 

(Mar2012-Mar2014) were considered, as they are the only years with a complete dataset for 

the whole freezing-thawing period in all sites (see Table 2 section 3.1.2).   

 

Firstly, the two-year’s average values of MaxGAT, MinGAT and MAGT in all depths for 

each borehole were determined (Annex A1). Then these values were plotted in a ground 

temperature to depth graphs to determine each borehole’s thermal “trumpet profile” as 

exemplified in Figure 27.  

 

 

 

When estimating each borehole’s ground trumpet profile, one must account for that the 

MAGT profile is not strictly linear but is offset to progressively lower values at depth within 

the active layer (Goodrich, 1978). Therefore, the best-fit to the observed data for the MAGT 

was not estimated as a strictly linear function but by adjusting the best curve to the observed 

data. 

 

Figure 27. Ground temperature to depth plot of the maximum (red), mean (green) and 

minimum (blue) annual ground temperatures constituting a borehole’s “trumpet profile”. 



  

45 

 

On the other hand, MinAGT and MaxAGT values, respectively increase or decrease with 

depth, following a non-linear function (Figure 2). Eventually, the ground temperature reaches 

the equilibrium and becomes seasonally invariable below the ZAA point. At this depth, 

known as “depth of zero annual amplitude”, values for MinGAT, MaxGAT and MAGT are 

considered infinitesimally equal (Péwé, 2016). 

 

Considering the behaviour explained above, the MinAGT and MaxAGT functions were 

approximated by minimum least square polynomial regressions. We have individually 

selected the most suitable polynomial degree of regressions for MinGAT and MaxGAT in 

terms of two facts: the regression curve with the highest value of local adjustment to the 

observed range of data (higher R² values); and the regression curves whose trend tends to 

cross together with MAGT at a common ZAA point. Values for local residuals, standard error 

and R² of each estimation were determined as well.  

 

For the boreholes where the depth of observations does not allow plotting the complete 

thermal regime’s trumpet profile until reaching the Top of Permafrost (sites 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 

9), the thermal profile was estimated down to the ZAA point by adjusting the most suitable 

least-squares regression curves to the available extent of the observed data. 

 

It is important to highlight that the regression curves for MinGAT and MaxGAT parameters 

should just be considered as good estimators locally, at lower depths than the ZAA depth. 

Below this depth, the temperature of permafrost becomes seasonally invariable (Delisle, 

2007) and increases steadily with depth following the MAGT tendency until reaching the base 

of permafrost (0 ºC) (Péwé, 1979).  

 

Once we had the graphs of all site’s ground thermal profiles, we determined the observed 

values (sites 1, 5 and 8) and the estimated by curve adjustment values (sites 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9) 

of the following parameters: depth of the Top of Permafrost (depth value when MaxGAT = 0 

ºC), Temperature at the Top of Permafrost (MAGT at the depth when MaxGAT = 0 ºC), depth 

and temperature at the ZAA point (depth and MAGT values when the three functions cross 

together), Mean Annual Ground Surface Temperature (MAGST), and the active layer’s 

thermal offset (computed as the difference between TTOP and MAGST (Burn and Smith, 

1988).  



  

46 

 

The ground surface temperature is a key parameter for the calculation of the MAGST and 

thus, for the calculation of the thermal offset as well. However, often ground surface 

temperature is not easy to measure due to the radiative and convective energy flows at the 

surface and difficulty in keeping the sensor in the same position. Because of these difficulties, 

nominal surface temperature measurements are often taken a few centimetres below the 

surface (Riseborough, 2003). In this work, because no data was available on temperature at 

the surface to empirically determine MAGST values for each borehole, corresponding values 

are based on data measured at 5 cm depth under the ground surface (i.e. the depth of the 

shallowest thermistor in all the boreholes). 

 

3.3 TTOP Model implementation 

Once analysed the ground temperature regimes profiles for the 9 specific locations, the next 

step was the implementation of the TTOP model. 

The TTOP model predicts the mean annual ground temperature at the depth of the top of the 

permafrost, or at the base of the seasonal freezing and thawing layer, if permafrost is absent, 

using relatively simple parameters representing key climate and terrain factors influencing the 

ground thermal regime (Way, 2016).  

 

The TTOP model was first computed and validated for the 9 locations, where observational 

temperature data is available. In a second stage, we spatialized the model all over the area of 

interest using statistical relations between topographic factors and the previously computed 

local TTOP model parameters, in a GIS-based environment.  

 

3.3.1 TTOP MODEL’S THEORY 

The TTOP model was developed by Smith &amp;amp; Riseborough (1996) to estimate the equilibrium 

temperature at the top of the permafrost at local or regional spatial scales. It constitutes a 

functional model of the relationship between permafrost and climate. It accommodates the 

geographical variations of climatic, surface and soil factors controlling the ground thermal 

regime and is a useful tool to analyse the impacts of climate change on ground temperatures 

(Smith &amp;amp; Riseborough, 1996). 

 

Analysing the responses of permafrost to climate requires an appropriate characterization of 

the permafrost-climate system. Following Lachenbruch et al. (1988), the permafrost-climate 



  

47 

 

relationship can be depicted by the temperature regime at four levels: (1) the temperature at 

standard screen height; (2) the temperature at the snow surface; (3) the temperature at the 

ground surface; (4) the temperature at the top of permafrost. 

Differences in mean temperature values at each of these levels are due to the variation trough 

time of heat transfer coefficients with temperatures through the different layers of the system. 

In the lower atmosphere, turbulent transfer varies diurnally and seasonally between stable and 

unstable conditions. Heat conduction at ground level varies between frozen and thawed states. 

The presence or absence of the snow cover determines if heat transfer right above the ground 

surface is predominantly conductive or convective. Heat transfer processes occurring at this 

interface and within the buffer layer are complex, implicating radiative influxes, turbulence, 

conduction, evaporation, and transpiration of living vegetation (Smith &amp;amp; Riseborough, 1996). 

 

The TTOP model uses the temperature regime at the top of permafrost (state 4) as the best 

level to study the climate-permafrost linkages, relating ground temperatures to the annual 

cycle of atmospheric temperatures. Between ground and atmospheric temperatures, the model 

takes into account the effects of local soil properties and surface conditions such as vegetation 

and snow cover, being the first considered as the greatest local influence on permafrost 

temperatures followed by the surface snow cover and vegetation (Smith &amp;amp; Riseborough, 

1996). 

 

Therefore, the TTOP model predicts the mean annual ground temperature at the depth of the 

top of the permafrost, or the base of seasonal freezing and thawing layer if permafrost is 

absent, using parameters representing climate, surface and lithological factors that have 

influence in the ground thermal regime (Smith and Riseborough 1996, Way &amp;amp; Lewkowicz, 

2016).  

These parameters include the air freezing and thawing indexes, air-ground temperature 

functions (n-factors) and the ratio of freezing to thawing thermal conductivities that account 

for the ground thermal offset (Burn &amp;amp; Smith 1988; Smith &amp;amp; Riseborough 1996, 2002; 

Karunaratne &amp;amp; Burn, 2003; Bevington &amp;amp; Lewkowicz 2015). N-factors provide a simplified 

representation of the influence of the surface buffer layer in modulating heat exchange 

between the atmosphere and the ground surface (Way et al., 2016). 

The standard formulation of the TTOP model as a function of all these parameters is 

expressed below in Equation 1a (Smith &amp;amp; Riseborough, 1996).

Secondary relations between the model’s parameters shown in Equation1b were applied to the 

main TTOP formula in order to give a simplified expression for the model (Equation 2) that 

was later used on in this work.

3.3.2 LOCAL COMPUTATION OF THE TTOP MODEL 

First, the TTOP model and its parameters were computed for the 9 monitoring sites where 

empirical data is available. Then, we evaluated the adjustment of the results given by the 

TTOP model formula to the TTOP values previously estimated or observed in each location 

using the results given by the trumpet profile’s analysis in Section 3.2. 

 

3.3.2.1 Freezing and thawing air degree days 

Air freezing degree-days (If) or air thawing degree-days (It) are defined as departures of air 

temperature from 0 ºC.  This index, also known as freezing or thawing index, is a measure of 

both duration and magnitude of below-freezing (or above-thawing) temperatures during a 

specified period. Therefore, the cumulative values of If or It for a given whole freezing-

thawing cycle gives insights about how cold or warm it has been the winter (freezing) or 

summer (thawing) season and for how long (Maslanik &amp;amp; Yu, 2010). 

 

As summarized in Frauenfeld et al. (2007), there are different ways to calculate the air 

freezing and thawing indexes in the literature. Huschke (1959) proposed the concept of a 

seasonal freezing and thawing index, which stayed as the present definition of 

freezing/thawing indexes given by the American Meteorological Society’s (AMS). The 

seasonal freezing index is computed in a particular site as the sum of all negative and positive 

daily air temperatures between the highest point, in autumn, and the lowest point, the next 

spring, on the cumulative degree-day time curve. In the same way, the seasonal thawing index 

is calculated as the arithmetic summation of all positive and negative mean daily air 

temperature at a specific site along the period from the spring until the next autumn.

Harris (1981) determined the total annual freezing and thawing index, which is estimated as 

the respective sum of all negative or positive mean daily air temperatures during a calendar 

year. Nonetheless, this definition is debatable since the freezing index computed over a 

calendar year does not include a complete cold season.   

For this investigation, we computed the annual freezing and thawing indexes as the area 

falling behead the sinusoidal curve (or integrated mean daily temperatures), for all days with 

temperatures below or above 0 °C, respectively, during a complete freezing/thawing natural 

cycle period (equation 4a). Empirically, this freezing and thawing indexes can be simplified 

as the absolute summation of the mean daily air temperatures for all days with temperatures 

below freezing (If) or above thawing (It) during a complete freezing/thawing cycle (Equation 

4b) (Frauenfeld et al., 2007).  

The annual freezing and thawing complete cycles over our dataset were defined in the 

PERIOD column of Table 2 (in Section 3.1.2) and go from the beginning of one year’s 

autumn (around March) to the end of the next year’s summer (around March next year), 

including both complete freezing and thawing periods. However, only the air temperatures of 

year 1 and 2, which have continuous air and ground temperature records during the total cycle 

(green tick, grey coloured), were used for the estimation of the Ita and Ifa parameters in this 

work.

Note that If is assigned a positive value when the temperature is below 0 ºC, so that (Ita- 

Ifa)/P in fact accounts for the mean annual air temperature (Smith &amp;amp; Riseborough, 1996). 

 

3.3.2.2 Surface Freezing/Thawing degree days 

 

Annual surface freezing degree-days (Ifs) or surface thawing degree-days (Its) are defined as 

departures of ground surface temperature from 0 ºC, during a complete freezing-thawing 

cycle (Maslanik &amp;amp; Yu, 2010).  

Following the same concept as the air degree days explained in the previous section, the 

annual surface freezing and thawing indexes are computed as the area falling behead the 

sinusoidal curve (or integral) of daily ground surface temperatures for all days with daily 

ground surface temperature below or above 0 °C during a whole freezing-thawing period 

respectively.  

Empirically, the freezing and thawing indexes can be simplified as the absolute summation of 

the mean daily surface temperatures over those days in the whole period when temperature is 

below freezing or above thawing (Frauenfeld et al., 2007). The annual freezing-thawing 

periods considered for the computation of these indexes is the same as the one used for the 

determination of the thawing and freezing air degree days. The general freezing and thawing 

indexes are calculated as per Equation 5:  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As previously mentioned in Section 3.2, as no data was available on temperature at the 

surface in this work, corresponding values are based on data measured at 5 cm depth under 

the ground surface. The final expression for It and If considering the surface at 5cm depth are 

expressed in Equation 6:

Nf= Number of days with ground temperatures below 0 ºC over the whole freezing-thawing 

period. 

Nt= Number of days with ground temperatures above 0 ºC over the whole freezing-thawing 

period. 

 

Note that Ifs is assigned a positive value when the temperature is below 0 ºC, so that (Its- 

Ifs)/P actually accounts for the mean annual ground surface temperature (Smith &amp;amp; 

Riseborough, 1996). 

 

3.3.2.3 nt, nf 

 

N factors relate seasonal air temperature to ground surface temperatures separated into two 

seasonal regimes, freezing and thawing (Lunardini, 1978). These affords a highly simplified 

expression to account for the local influence of vegetation (moss bed in this work) and snow 

cover in a variety of heat transfer processes (e.g. conduction, convection, transpiration) 

occurring within the buffer layer constituted by different surface land-covers (Lunardini, 

1981). As the snow cover is reduced to the minimum in summer, the summer thawing n-

factor incorporates all microclimatic effects (radiation, convection, evapotranspiration, etc.) 

due mainly to the moss cover while the winter freezing n-factor is mainly dominated by the 

influence of snow cover. (Smith &amp;amp; Riseborough, 1996)

53 

 

The n-factors are generally greater in the thawing season (nt) than the freezing season (nf) 

(Taylor, 1995; Smith et al., 1998), while the freezing season n-factor has been proved to be 

lowered at sites without permafrost, or with a very deep active layer, because of the 

continuing contribution of latent heat released during frost penetration (Burn, 1998). 

 

In general, the n-factors are determined empirically, by collecting air and surface ground 

temperatures simultaneously at sites representative of ecological units. Then, the n-factors are 

calculated as the ratio of the ground surface freezing or thawing indexes to the freezing or 

thawing air temperature indexes for the same season (Lunardini, 1978 in Burn, 1998), as per 

the Equations 7a and 7b. 

 

Ita = Cumulative air thawing degree days (ºCdia) 

Ifa = Cumulative air freezing degree days (ºCdia) 

Its = Cumulative surface thawing degree days (ºCdia) 

Ifs = Cumulative air surface degree days (ºCdia) 

nt = Scaling factor between air and surface thawing index  

nf = Scaling factor between air and surface freezing index 

 

Due to the scarce of experimental ground surface temperatures mentioned before in section 

3.2, n-factors in this work were computed as the ratio of the ground freezing or thawing 

indexes at 5cm depth to the freezing or thawing air temperature indexes (Equation 8). 

Therefore, by considering Ts ? T5cm, the n-factors in this work not only accounts for the 

moss and snow cover, but for the thermal offset occurring in the top 5cm surface layer as 

well.

Following the expressions represented above, in sites 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 9 (characterized by a 

bedrock substrate), the n-factors account for the top 5 cm rock surface layer plus the potential 

snow cover thermal buffer effect through the year. For sites 4 and 5 (characterized by a 

unconsolidated substrate), the n-factors account for the top 5 cm soil layer plus the potential 

snow cover thermal buffer effect through the year. Finally, in site 8 (characterized by 40 cm 

of moss cover over a peat substrate), the n-factors account for the top 5 cm moss layer plus 

the potential snow cover thermal buffer effect through the year.   

 

3.3.2.4 Kt/Kf 

 

Kt/Kf stands for the ratio between the thermal conductivity of a thawed soil and the thermal 

conductivity of the same soil when frozen. 

Considering that the soils are composed by multiple phase materials with different physical 

properties such as solid particles, gas and/or liquid, the thermal properties of the soils are 

affected by the variation of each phase too. As mentioned in Dong et al. (2015), the thermal 

conductivity k varies depending on the soil phase. As an example, values of k of different 

materials are given: thermal conductivity of mineral particles kmineral = 3 W/m K, thermal 

conductivity of dry soil kdry_soil=0.5 W/m K , thermal conductivity of water kwater = 0.56 

W/m K (at 0 ºC), and thermal conductivity of air kair = 0.026 W/m K) (Mitchell &amp;amp; Soga 2005; 

Yun &amp;amp; Santamarina 2008).  

In dry soils, which account with a lower packing density of particles and more porosity, the 

air obstructs the heat conduction occurring through the particle contacts. This fact, together 

with the mineral composition, explains the significant difference between k values of pure 

mineral soils and dry soils (Farouki, 1981). At the other end, in water saturated soils, the 

replacement of air with water provides a significant improvement in the heat conduction 

through the soil mixture. Consequently, the magnitude of the thermal conductivity of water-

saturated soil is between that of the pure mineral and that of water. The ordered sequence of 

typical thermal conductivity values is: kair&lt;kdry_soil&lt;kwater&lt;ksaturated_soil&lt;kmineral.  

 

 

 

 



  

55 

 

Therefore, the thermal properties of soils, considering isothermal conditions, mainly depend 

on different factors as: mineralogy, particle size, particle shape, porosity and moisture content 

(Dong et al., 2015). These factors can be sum up in two main groups: soil type and ground 

water content. 

 

- Soil type: Mineralogy, porosity particle size and shape are the characteristics defining 

de different types of soil. Pure mineral soils are the ones characterized by the highest 

thermal conductivity in the air–water–solid soil system. 

Considering that a larger particle’s diameter promotes a higher rate of heat flux 

between particles, larger particles with less contacts in a given volume result in higher 

thermal conductivity (Aduda, 1996).  

- Water content: Moisture content in the soil is a dominant factor to the thermal 

conductivity. The higher the water content in the soil, the higher heat transfer rate 

through the substrate, especially in unconsolidated and high porosity soils.  

 

 

3.3.2.5 Thermal Offset 

 

The thermal offset is defined as the difference between the TTOP and at the MAGST  (Wu &amp;amp; 

Shi, 2003) (see Equation 9). This equation comes from the relation previously represented in 

Equation 3. 

 

 

 

 

 

In Equation 9, TTOP stands for the temperature at the top of permafrost and MAGST for the 

mean annual ground surface temperature, which in this work, is considered 5 cm below the 

surface.  

 

The thermal offset arises because the thermal conductivity of a soil is higher when frozen than 

when thawed. This effect can be explained by the seasonal variations in soil moisture near the 

ground surface, with drier surface conditions in the thawing period and wetter conditions in 

the freezing period increasing the effect (Smith &amp;amp; Riseborough, 1996). 

??????? =  ???? ? ????? 

Equation 9. Thermal offset as a function of TTOP and MAGST (Burn &amp;amp; Smith, 1988) 



  

56 

 

A theoretical expression to link thermal offsets with the thermal regime and characteristics of 

the active layer near-surface permafrost (Equation 10) was put forward by Romanovsky &amp;amp; 

Osterkamp (1995): 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In Equation 10, kf and kt are the thermal conductivities of the active layer in frozen and 

thawed states, Its is the annual total thawing degree-days at the ground surface and P is the 

period of the thawing and freezing cycle.  

As ground thermal fluxes were not measured in this investigation, the values of Kt and Kf 

could not be compute for our locals and its uncertainty cannot be discussed. However, the 

thermal offset values for each monitoring site was determined with the application of 

Equation 9 when analysing the ground temperature to depth “trumpet profile” graphs. 

Therefore, Equation 2 was the general expression chosen for the computation of the TTOP 

model in this work.  

 

3.3.2.6 TTOP local implementation and validation 

Once the TTOP model parameters were determined for the 9 monitoring sites, we used the 

results to implement the general TTOP model formula (Equation 2) in these locations to 

determine the Temperature at the Top of Permafrost. Then, we evaluated the adjustment of 

the results given by the TTOP model formula to the TTOP values previously estimated or 

observed in each location using the analysis of the trumpet profile.  

 

To validate the TTOP model at a local scale, we plotted the TTOP formula results with the 

values observed or estimated values by graphical analysis of the trumpet profile. The better 

the adjustment of the scatter dots to the y=x line, the better is considered the estimation of the 

TTOP model. 

After evaluating this adjustment, the TTOP model was found to be a good estimator for the 

temperature at the top of permafrost, suitable to be spatially extrapolated for the whole area 

extent.

3.3.3 SPATIAL COMPUTATION OF THE MODEL 

Once calculated the values of all the parameters of the TTOP model for the 9 sites, we aimed 

to spatialize these parameters, in order to extend the local TTOP model results to the study 

area. Each parameter of the model was spatialized following its statistical relations with 

different terrain features. 

In order to identify the spatial controls on the TTOP parameters, literature was reviewed to 

identify which features were expected to show a higher influence in each TTOP parameter 

using the literature.  

Secondly, the spatial distribution of these terrain features was modelled using the software 

ArcMap10.4.  

Later on, the correlations between each terrain feature and the TTOP parameters, were 

calculated, in order to identify their statistical significance in our particular area of interest. 

Finally, statistical relations were established between TTOP parameters and its most 

influencing terrain features. The workflow for this process is explained below. 

 

3.3.3.1 Potential influence of terrain features in the TTOP parameters 

 

A) Air thawing and freezing indexes 

The air thawing and freezing indexes (It, If) are directly related with the air temperature. 

However, the atmosphere is not isothermal but air temperature generally falls quite noticeably 

with increasing altitude following the adiabatic lapse rate of the atmosphere, defined as “the 

change of temperature with a change in altitude of an air parcel that decreases in pressure and 

temperature and increases in volume without gaining or losing any heat to the environment 

surrounding the parcel” (Muralikrishna &amp;amp; Manickam, 2017). 

As a function of air temperature, the air thawing and freezing indexes are also expected to be 

linearly related with height.  

 

B) N-factors 

In section 3.3.2.3, we introduced that n-factors mainly account for the local influence of moss 

cover, snow cover and the 5 cm surface layer thermal offset, which variates depending on 

surface characteristics (soil type and moss bed).  

The primary influence of moss cover in n-factors is due to the great insulation effect, as the 

moss both shades and insulates the ground resulting in a reduction of solar radiation reaching 



  

58 

 

the ground surface and summer heat flux (Guglielmin et al., 2012). In addition, the 

interception of precipitation and the transpiration by the moss influences the ground thermal 

regime through the water balance (Smith &amp;amp; Risebourgh, 1996). Consequently, sites covered 

by moss are expected to be characterized by lower values of n-factor, representing a greater 

ground insulating buffer layer, while bare ground sites show higher n-factors with values 

closer to the unity (air temperature equals the ground surface temperatures). 

On the other hand, considering that our study area consists only of the snow-free areas in the 

end of summer, a buffer layer of snow will form over most places, mainly during the winter. 

Snow cover of any depth acts as a physical barrier, preventing solar radiation and wind 

variations from influencing temperature fluctuations on the ground surface (Humlum, 1997). 

In addition, the low thermal conductivity of snow restricts the loss of heat from the ground 

during the coldest part of the year. As a result, local spatial variability in snow cover is the 

largest single factor accounting for variations in the ground surface temperature mainly during 

the winter months (Desrochers &amp;amp; Granberg, 1988), but also in spring and autumn, although at 

a lower rate as these seasons are generally characterized by thinner snow cover (Guglielmin et 

al., 2012). Therefore, snow cover has a strong influence mostly in the freezing n-factor values. 

This relationship between snow cover and nf is expected to be negative, thus the thicker the 

snow cover, the higher the insulation and the lowest the freezing n-factor (Lanouette et al., 

2015). 

 

The spatial distribution of snow cover usually depends on topographic features and 

characteristics of the ground. Elevation, aspect and curvature are topographic features that 

have been found to be statistically significant in the variability of winter snow accumulation 

and spring melt according to results obtained by Erickson &amp;amp; Williams (2005) and Jost et al. 

(2007). These studies showed that elevation had a strong positive relationship mainly in the 

periods of peak snow accumulation and during snow-melt. Regarding to aspect, south-facing 

slopes would have the highest correlation with snow accumulation in the southern 

hemisphere.  

The curvature affects the acceleration, deceleration, convergence and divergence of flow 

across the surface and, therefore, influences snow deposition. Concave curvatures are 

expected to have a higher potential accumulation of snow than convex sites.  

The last factor influencing in the n-factors would be the thermal offset present in the 5 cm top 

surface layer, this mainly depending on the thermal characteristics of the top 5 cm soil layer, 



  

59 

 

being the substrate type and water content the main factors with potential influence on its 

thermal characteristics. 

 

Therefore, elevation, aspect, curvature, moss cover, substrate type and water content might be 

somehow correlated with n-factors and were assumed as possible candidates explaining a 

large proportion of the spatial variability of n-factors.  

 

B) Thermal Offset 

In section 3.3.2.5, we introduced that the active layer thermal offset, as a function of the 

thawed and frozen thermal conductivity ratio kt/kf, accounts for the thermal properties of the 

substrate, which mainly depend on the type and water content of the substrate at different 

depths and locations (Wu &amp;amp; Shi, 2003). Equation 9 defines the thermal offset of the 

seasonally thawing layer as the difference of the temperature in the TOP and the ground 

surface. 

 

Figure 28 suggests that the substrates with higher conductivity show steepest temperature 

gradients than the ones with lower conductivities (Williams &amp;amp; Smith, 1989). The steeper the 

thermal gradient (and thus the higher conductivity), the lower the result of the absolute value 

of the thermal offset (TTOP-MAGST) and vice-versa.  

 



  

60 

 

 

 

Considering the aforementioned relation in section 3.3.2.4 (kair &amp;lt;kdry_soil &amp;lt;kwater &amp;lt;

ksaturated_soil &amp;lt;kmineral), the mineral soils and bedrock (with low porosity) have the 

highest thermal conductivity when they are dry, however, for peat and uncosolidated 

substrates (with higher porosity), a higher soil moisture content increases the soil’s 

conductivity (Wu &amp;amp; Shi, 2003). Therefore, the water content of the substrate is expected to 

have a large influence in the thermal offset. However, the statistical relationships between 

thermal offset and water content must be determined separately for bedrock areas in one side 

and for peats and unconsolidated materials on the other. 

 

3.3.3.2 Spatial distribution of TTOP controlling factors 

Elevation, aspect, curvature, moss cover, substrate type and water content have been 

considered to have potential influence in TTOP parameters and are assumed to explain a large 

proportion of the spatial variability these parameters. The spatial distribution of these terrain 

features over the area of interest was implemented with a resolution of 1 m using the GIS 

based software ArcMap10.4 as follows:

• Moss cover: The areas covered by moss were determined by analysis of the high-

resolution orthomosaic presented in Section 3.1.3. Feature polygons were 

manually created over the most noticeable moss patches using the software 

ArcMap 10.4. This feature layer was later converted to raster format (Figure 29).  

 

 

• Snow cover: The seasonal snow cover cannot be determined by simple 

observation of the mosaic, as it represents an end of summer scenario and the 

distribution and thickness of the snow vary spatially and temporarily. As 

mentioned in section 3.3.3.1B, the surface snow accumulation depends on different 

landforms and terrain features, as elevation, aspect, terrain curvature or solar 

radiation. 

These parameters were derived from the 1 m resolution’s digital surface model 

(DSM) described in Section 3.1.3 using the ArcGIS’s Spatial Analyst tools:

• Ground thermal offset: The ground thermal offset is related with the soil’s active 

layer ratio of thawed and frozen thermal conductivity (Equation 10). Therefore, the 

main influencing factors in the thermal offset are expected to be the same ones 

influencing the soil’s thermal conductivity, such as the substrate type and water 

content (see Section 3.3.2.5). 

These two factors were determined as follows:  

- Substrate type: A soil type map was implemented through aerial photo 

interpretation in ArcMap 10.4 based on the high resolution ortophotomap. The 

substrate was classified in bedrock, unconsolidated soil and peat. Feature 

polygons were shaped over the different soil type’s areas to be later converted 

to raster format (Figure 33). 

- Topographic wetness index (TWI): The TWI is a steady-state wetness index 

that describes a form of potential wetness due to topographic and not 

subsurface conditions. The index is widely employed as a soil moisture 

substitute, and several studies exist relating it to measured soil moisture (e.g. 

Etzelmüller, 2006; Sulebak et al., 2000; Hugget and Cheesman, 2002). 

TWI index involves the upslope contributing area (a), a slope raster (B), in the 

following relation (Cooley, 2016a):  

 

 

 

 

The value of a for each cell in the output raster is the value of the flow 

accumulation for the corresponding DEM raster. It was extracted from the 

filled DSM following the method explained in Cooley (2016b).  

Higher TWI values represent drainage lines, with low gradient areas showing 

greater potential to gather water and increase potential soil water saturation. 

Lower values represent crests and ridges with steep and convex characteristics, 

tending to disperse water and showing lower potential soil moisture. The 

computed TWI spatial distribution is shown in Figure 34.

3.3.3.3 Correlation between TTOP parameters and controlling factors 

Once determined the spatial distribution of terrain features over the area, we analysed the 

statistical correlation between each feature and the previously computed local TTOP 

parameters for each monitoring site.  This allows determining the statistical significance of 

the control of each terrain feature for the TTOP parameters. 

To determine the correlations of these features, we computed non-parametric (Spearman) 

correlations and regression parameters using the statistical package IBM SPSS Statistics 25. 

Spearman rank correlation is a non-parametric test that is used to measure the degree of 

relation between two variables. It assesses how well the relationship between two variables 

can be described using a monotonic function. The Spearman rank correlation test does not 

carry any assumption about the distribution of the data and is the appropriate correlation 

analysis when the variables are measured on a scale that is at least ordinal (Statistical 

Solutions, 2018). 

The following formula was used to calculate the Spearman rank correlation: 

 

 

 

 

 

Where:  

?= Spearman rank correlation 

di= the difference between the ranks of corresponding variables 

n= number of observations 

 

A perfect Spearman correlation of +1 or ?1 occurs when each of the variables is a perfect 

monotone function of the other. A positive correlation coefficient indicates a direct 

relationship between the two variables (as one variable increases, the other variable also 

increases), while a negative correlation coefficient expresses an inverse relationship (as one 

variable increases, the other variable decreases).  A correlation coefficient of 0 indicates that no 

relationship exists between the variables and a coefficient of 1 indicates a perfect relationship 

(Statistical Solutions, 2018).  

? = 1 ?
6 ? ?2?

?(?2 ? 1)

In order to determine the strength of the relationship, the conventions proposed by Cohen 

(1988) may be considered. He proposed that correlation coefficients between .10 and .29 

represent a weak association, coefficients between .30 and .49 represent a medium 

association, and coefficients of .50 and above represent a large association or relationship. 

 

3.3.3.4 Relationship functions and parameter spatialization 

In order to identify the relationships between the TTOP parameters (dependent variables) and 

its most influencing factors (independent variables or predictors), we computed multivariate 

linear regressions using the SPSS software tool. 

Following the Peter’s rule of thumb, in order to estimate a dependant variable using 

multivariate linear regressions, ideally a minimum sample size of 10 sample points is needed 

per each independent variable used as a predictor (Peduzzi et al., 1996). The available sample 

size in this investigation is just 9 sample points, however this sample size was considered 

close enough to the minimum to apply this estimation method using only one estimator per 

each dependent variable. It is important to take in consideration that the scarce number of 

sample points might create a higher probability of relation due to randomness in the results. 

For the estimation of functions using multivariable regression, it is first necessary to check 

some assumptions regarding to the input data. These assumptions are described below as per 

Statistical Solutions (2018b): 

• Linearity: The outcome variable and the independent variables must follow a linear 

relationship.  Scatterplots are a good tool to evaluate if there is a linear or curvilinear 

relationship. 

• Multivariate Normality: Multiple regression consider that the residuals (differences 

between the observed value of the dependent variable and the predicted value) present 

a normal distribution. The normality of residuals can be evaluated with a normal 

Predicted Probability (P-P) plot. If they are, they will adjust to the diagonal normality 

line indicated in the plot.  

 

 

 



  

68 

 

• Homoscedasticity: Multiple regression assumes that the variance of residuals is similar 

across the values of the independent variables.  When exanimating a plot of 

standardized residuals versus predicted values, we can evaluate weather points are 

equally distributed across all values of the independent variables. There should be no 

defined pattern in the distribution, the data should look like randomly speared over the 

plot; if there is a cone-shaped pattern, the data is heteroscedastic. 

• No Multicollinearity: The independent variables must not be highly correlated with 

each other.  This assumption can be tested using the Spearman correlation matrix 

(correlations among all predictor variables should be less than .80) or the Variance 

Inflation Factor (VIF) values should be lower than 10. 

However, as we just used one independent variable as a predictor for each model 

parameter (following the Peter’s rule of thumb), it was not necessary to check this 

assumption conscientiously.  

 

Following these considerations, each TTOP parameter was expressed as a function of the 

terrain feature with the highest Spearman correlation, besides a logic physical relationship as 

explained in section 3.3.3.1. Thus, It and If were expressed as a function of the elevation, Nt 

and Nf were to be expressed as a function of the moss cover and curvature respectively and, 

toffset as a function of TWI depending on the different soil types.  

 

The rules compliance of the assumptions mentioned above was tested for each parameter of 

the linear regression. Exceptionally, a different method was used for the computation of the 

relationship between nt and moss cover. Simple linear regression cannot be applied to this 

parameter due to the availability of a single borehole with the moss cover attribute. This fact 

limited the statistical analysis of these data to correlations and created a high probability of 

relation due to randomness. However, the moss cover was shown to have a noticeable 

influence in the nt parameter in the correlation matrix and a difference of 1.01 in the nt values 

was observed between analogue monitoring sites 7-MossRock (nt=2.00) and 8-MossMoss 

(nt=0.99) only differenced by the presence of absence of moss cover. Thus, a different 

relation between nt factor and moss cover was applied for the spatialization of the parameter.  

The mean of nf values obtained in the moss-free monitoring sites (nt=2.08) was given to the 

moss-free areas, whereas this mean value minus 1.01, was given to all the areas covered by 

mosses.

3.3.4 SPATIAL MODEL IMPLEMENTATION 

Once the relationship functions were established for each TTOP parameter, these expressions 

were computed in ArcMap 10.4 over the study area. The spatial distribution of the different 

parameters of the model resulted in five 1 m resolution rasters. Then, the TTOP model 

expression (Equation 2) was computed introducing as inputs the previously spatialized 

parameters. The resulting map for the spatial distribution of the TTOP model all over the 

study area had a resolution of 1 m as well and are presented in the results section 4. 

 

 
3.4 Spatial model validation 

Once a spatial model was created for each parameter, we checked how close the results of the 

parameters’ spatial estimation were to the parameters determined locally for each monitoring 

site using observed data. Then, we validated the final TTOP spatial model by comparing the 

results to the observed data about the Temperature in the Top Of Permafrost previously 

determined in section 3.2.  

 

 

3.5 TTOP spatial model considering a 1 ºC air temperature increase 

scenario 

Once the TTOP spatial model was created, the resulting model was used to identify and 

evaluate the potential sensitivity of permafrost and the seasonal thawing layer in case of a 

hypothetical scenario, showing a 1 ºC increase in the long term mean annual temperatures. 

For this purpose, we computed the air thawing and freezing indexes with a 1 ºC increment 

over the recorded air temperatures during years 1 and 2. As a generalization, n-factors and 

thermal offset values were considered to remain constant in this hypothetical scenario, 

disregarding changes in any other topo-climatic factor such as seasonal snow pack, moss 

distribution or soil moisture content.  

The TTOP spatial model was ran using the new input values of Ita and Ifa, considering the 

mean daily temperature increase of 1 ºC in a long-term scenario.  

When the air temperatures increase considering these assumptions, the ground temperatures 

are expected to also increase, at higher or smaller rates, until the thermal regime reaches a 

stationary state. When this happens, the three curves (MinAGT, MAGT and MaxAGT) in the 



  

70 

 

ground thermal “trumpet profile” (Figure 2) will slightly shift over the x-axis to warmer 

temperatures maintaining the original profile (once reached the stationary state). 

When the new TTOP point reaches 0 ºC in the MAGT curve as a consequence of a general 

ground warming, it means that below the depth at that point, the mean annual ground 

temperature will keep positive values until reaching the ZAA point. Therefore, positive TTOP 

values below that depth, whichever it is, correspond to the mean annual temperature at the top 

of the seasonal freezing and thawing layer, where permafrost is not present anymore.  

 

Considering these properties of the ground’s thermal regime, the spatial distribution of the 

Temperature of the Top of Permafrost after the hypothetical MAAT increment was computed 

over the study area. This allowed for the determination of the most sensitive permafrost areas 

to warming.

4. Results and discussion 

4.1 Characteristics of the local ground temperature regimes  

Site 1 borehole provided the most complete ground and air temperature graph, with 

continuous records from 2012 to 2018 (Figures 20 and 35) and shows the best data to evaluate 

how the ground temperature regime evolved during this period in Cierva Point and its 

relations with air temperature fluctuations. Permafrost was found in this borehole within the 

thermistors’ depth extent with the top of permafrost occurring at approximately 5 m depth.  

Figure 37 shows the difference on the inter annual fluctuations of the temperatures at 3 

different levels: air (at 150 cm above the surface), the surface (at 5cm depth) and the mean 

depth of the top of permafrost (5 m). This graph is a useful tool for the interpretation of the 

climate characteristics of this site and its linkages with ground temperature fluctuations over 

the period from 2012 to 2018 (even though a gap exists in the air temperature records from 

2014 to 2016). The analysis of this graph gives some insights about the thermal impact of the 

snowpack on the ground surface temperature. Through its buffer effect as an insulator layer, 

the snowpack influences the thermal offset existing between air and surface temperature. The 

thermal offset between air and surface (?T) is defined as the difference between the ground 

surface temperature (GST) and air temperature (Tair). 

 

?T (°C)= GST-Tair 

 

Winter and summer air temperatures over the period did not show significant differences, 

despite an outlier minimum peak of -20°C in the winter of 2013. The maximum air 

temperature reached over the period was 4.25°C in the last summer season (2017). 

However, some differences were found in the thermal offset (?T) values during the periods 

from 2012-2014 and 2016-2018. In the first period, the winter ground surface thermal regime 

shows a stronger decoupling from the cold air temperatures than in the period of 2016-2018, 

resulting in a strong positive surface thermal offset and a warmer value of the MAGST. In 

contrast, the surface thermal regime at the second period is strongly coupled with the 

atmospheric conditions involving a lower surface thermal offset and lower values of MAGST, 

indicating that the snowpack provided a weak insulation to the surface. These observations 

may reflect a longer lasting and thicker snowpack accumulation during the winter seasons of 

2012 and 2013, which would have provided a higher insulation to the surface for longer than 



  

72 

 

the thinner snowpack in 2016-2018. A reduction of the active layer thickness during the first 

two years of the dataset in Figure 36a may also be explained by this fact. 

This phenomenon was observed as well in nearby Western Antarctic regions such as 

Deception Island (WAP). Here, between 2006 and 2014, a reduction of the active layer 

thickness at a rate of about 1.5– 2cm a?1 linked with episodes of longer lasting and thicker 

snow accumulation over the surface, was reported (Goyanes et al., 2014; Ramos et al., 2017). 

 

 

However, not only the snow cover thickness can influence the MAGST fluctuations but also 

the snow properties, the near-surface material properties, and especially the snowpack timing 

and duration (Ling &amp;amp; Zhang, 2003). 

The timing of the snowpack disappearance in spring coincides with the time when the GST 

rises above 0 ºC, normally after a brief zero curtain effect period. This effect maintains the 

GST close to 0 ºC due to the influence of the latent heat consumption in spring during 

snowmelt (Davense et al., 2017). During the spring of 2015 and 2017, the zero curtain effect 

was observed to be very short (only a few days starting at the end of November and ending in 

early December), in comparison with the previous years (when the zero curtain effect lasted 

for more than a month from the end of November to early January), which suggests the 

thinner snowpack accumulation during these years. 

The early and brief snowmelt in spring is favourable to quick surface warming and higher 

temperatures at the top of permafrost after the warm season because of the direct exposure of 

Figure 35. Air, ground surface and top of permafrost temperatures over the period from 2012 to 2018. Records of 

air temperature from 2014 to 2016 were not available. 

 



  

73 

 

the ground to solar radiation, positive air temperature, and the low amount of heat required to 

melt the thin snowpack (Ling &amp;amp; Zhang, 2003). 

Nevertheless, significant variations on the top of permafrost thermal wave have not been 

found. Only a slightly decrement of the TTOP below 0 ºC during the warm season was 

spotted after the winters showing longer zero curtain effects and therefore, a possible thicker 

snowpack accumulation. 

 

Figure 36b shows the inter-annual oscillations observed in the depth of the top of permafrost. 

The active layer thickness slightly decreased along the first two years of monitoring (2012-

2014), from almost 6 m the first year and reaching its minimum depth in 2014 (ci. 4 m). 

During the following years, from 2015 to the beginning of 2018, the top of permafrost ranged 

between 4.5 and 5 m.

The dataset of ground temperatures for the other sites is not continuous, thus the ground 

thermal profile graphs (Figures 37a-44a) show several gaps. Consequently, for the 

implementation of the “trumpet profile” graphs (Figures 37b-44b) in each borehole, only the 

average temperatures of years 1 and 2, from March 2012 to March 2014 (with complete 

records for a thawing/freezing cycle), were used to estimate the MaxAGT, MAGT and 

MinAGT. The best-fit functions, approximated by least squares regression to the MaxAGT, 

MAGT and MinAGT are presented in Table 4. 

 

 

In the “trumpet profiles” for Sites 5-Moraine and site 8-MossMoss (Figures 40b and 43b), the 

MaxAGT was observed to stay invariable close to 0 ºC below 1 m and 0.4 m, respectively. 

This reflects the high moisture content at these depths, as no temperature change occurs from 

heat transfer during the phase change from ice to liquid water due to its latent heat of fusion, 

so that during the summer the temperature remains constant at 0 ºC.  

Considering that the thermistors provide measurements with an uncertainty of 0.5 ºC, and the 

ice-water mixture stability, 0 ºC was considered to be the actual temperature existing in the 

ground during the warm season and matching with continuous ice-thawing below 1 m depth 

in Site5 and 0.4 m in Site8. Therefore, the mean difference between the measured MaxAGT 

and 0 ºC during the phase change for each borehole (0.15 ºC and 0.3 ºC respectively) were 

subtracted from the observed ground temperature for 0 ºC calibration. 

The thermal trumpet profile, after rectification, is shown in figures 40c and 43c. These figures 

show that below 1 m and 0.4 m respectively in boreholes 5 and 8, the ground never thaws 

completely and therefore these depths were considered the upper limit of the permafrost table. 

Permafrost was not clearly observed in the rest of the boreholes, which are not deep enough to 

reach the permafrost table, or even because permafrost may be absent.

The average value of each borehole’s thawing and freezing indexes were considered for the 

determination of the TTOP model. Generally, and accordingly to the adiabatic lapse rate 

mentioned in section 3.3.3.1, sites located at higher elevation resulted to have higher values of 

Ifa and lower values of Ita occurred at elevations (ex. Site 2, the highest altitude site at 336 m 

shows Ifa = 1422.11 °Cdays and Ita = 112.5 °Cdays.). Low altitude sites were characterized 

by lower values of Ifa and higher values of Ita (ex. Site 7 and 8, at 70 m show an Ifa = 988.2 

°Cdays and an Ita = 304.7 °Cdays).  

 

4.2.1.2 Its/Ifs 

The ground thawing and freezing indexes for the 9 monitoring sites in Cierva Point are shown 

in Table 7. These were computed as explained in Section 3.3.2.2 using empirical data from 

natural years 1 and 2, which had a continuous dataset for the complete freezing/thawing 

cycles (see Table 2. Section 3.1.2). The average value of each borehole’s thawing and 

freezing indexes were used for the determination of the TTOP model.  

 

 

 

Exceptionally, due to the scarce of experimental data for year 2 in Site 6, only the values of 

Its-Ifs of year 1 were taken in consideration for this borehole.  

 

Site 2 (Summit) was characterized by the highest value of surface freezing index (Ifs = 

1162.14 °Cdays) and Site 6 (Midslope) by the lowest (Ifs = 630.97 and Ifs = 1162.14 °Cdays). 

On the other hand, the maximum surface thawing index obtained was in Site 9 (Its = 548.65 

°Cdays) and the minimum in Site 1 (Permafrost) with a value of Its = 169.01 °Cdays. These 

values are influenced by the topo-climatic characteristics of each site and by other attributes, 

such as the substrate thermal properties and the insulation effect of moss or snow cover.

4.2.1.3 Nt/Nf 

The local results of the thawing and freezing n-factors for the 9 monitoring Sites in Cierva 

point are shown in Table 8. These were computed as explained in Section 3.3.2.3 as the ratio 

of average ground and air thawing and freezing indexes previously computed. 

As previously introduced in section 3.3.3.1.B, n-factors mainly account for the local influence 

of moss cover, snow cover and the 5 cm surface layer thermal offset, which varie depending 

on surface characteristics (soil type and moss bed).  

The highest value of freezing N-factor (0.91) was found in Site 5 (Moraine) and in Site 2 

(summit), the maximum thawing n-factor was found (4.32). 

The lowest value of freezing n-factor (1.43) was found in Site 1 (Permafrost), being Site 8 

(MossMoss) characterized by the lowest thawing factor (0.99). Here, the lower value of Nt for 

Site 8 (0.99) against the value in the analogue Site 7 (2.00) is explained by the presence of a 

thick moss cover in the first site, which acts as a thermal insulator layer.  

The linkages between the potential snow cover and the top layer thermal offset with the 

magnitude of n-factors in the rest of the boreholes are further discussed in Section 4.3, after 

the analysis of the curvature and thermal offset characterizing these sites. 

 

4.2.1.4 Toffset 

The local results of the active layer thermal offset for the 9 monitoring Sites in Cierva Point 

are shown in Table 9. These were computed as explained in Section 3.3.2.5 as the difference 

of the Temperature at the Top of Permafrost (TTOP) and the Mean Annual Ground Surface 

Temperature (MAGST).

The highest value of thermal offset between the permafrost table and the surface was 

observed in Site 9 with 1.19 °C, being Site 5 characterized by the lowest value, with -0.70 °C. 

The differences in these values arise mainly due to the differences on the thermal properties of 

the substrate, which mainly depend on the type of substrate and water content at different 

depths and locations (Wu &amp;amp; Shi, 2003). The linkages between the resulting thermal offset 

values with the substrate characteristics and moisture content are further discussed in Section 

4.3, after the analysis of the substrate type and topographic wetness indexes characterizing 

these sites. 

 

4.2.2 LOCAL RESULTS OF TTOP AND MODEL VALIDATION 

Table 10 summarizes the results for all the TTOP model parameters (Is, Ia, n-factors, toffset) 

previously computed using the observed data together with the local results for the depth at 

the TOP and the TTOP values estimated or observed using the analysis of the trumpet profile. 

At the bottom of the Table 10, the TTOP results given by the TTOP model equation 

(Equation 2) are presented.  

 

 

 

The deepest permafrost table was found to be in Site 1 (Permafrost), where the permafrost 

table was observed at 5 m depth with a temperature of -1.21°C. However, a value 0.07°C 

higher was obtained computing the TTOP formula (equation 2). In Sites 5 (Moraine) and 8 

(MossMoss), the temperature at the top of permafrost was found to be -2.59°C and -1.35°C, at 

1 m and 0.4 m respectively, coinciding with the depth of isothermal maximum annual surface 

temperature at 0°C. A slight difference of -0.25°C was found between the observed data in 

Table 10. Results for all the TTOP model parameters (Is, Ia, n-factors, toffset), the depth at the Top of 

Permafrost (TOP) and the Temperature at the Top Of Permafrost (TTOP) values estimated or observed using the 

analysis of the trumpet profile and TTOP results given by the TTOP model equation. All values are given 

together with the propagated measurement uncertainty.

Site 5 and the value obtained through the TTOP equation (which is the maximum difference 

found in all the boreholes), while no difference occurs in Site 8. 

 

For the other monitored sites, TOP and TTOP were estimated by graphical analysis of the 

temperature regression functions in their trumpet profiles. The permafrost table was estimated 

to exist at depths ranging from 4.26 m (in Site 6) and 1.9 m (in Site 4) below the ground 

surface and the TTOP values determined range from -2.42°C (in Site 3) and -0.18°C (in Site 

7). In Site 9, no permafrost is estimated to occur. Therefore, the value of 0.26°C in this 

location corresponds to the ground temperature at the base of the seasonal freezing and 

thawing layer. 

Figure 45 shows the degree of adjustment of the TTOP formula (Equation 2) results with the 

observed or estimated values by graphical analysis. The adjustment is better when 

observed/estimated values equal the values resulting from the TTOP model equation. 

Therefore, the adjustment is considered to be better when the distribution of dots and triangles 

is closer to the y=x line (grey dotted line in the Figure 45). The plot results show a value of 

adjustment of the data of R2=0.98 to the y=x line and a mean error of 0.05 ºC between 

modelled and observed data, being the site 1 (Permafrost) the one presenting the highest 

deviation. With these values, the TTOP model was considered as a good estimator for the 

temperature at the top of permafrost, suitable to be spatially extrapolated for the whole area 

extent.

observed or estimated values determined first by graphical analysis of the trumpet profile.

4.3 Terrain factors and their correlation with TTOP parameters 

Table 11 shows the values of terrain factors in each monitoring site determined as explained 

in section 3.3.3.2.  

 

 

 

The results of the Spearman correlation values (?) between terrain factors and TTOP 

parameters are shown in Table 12. Values coloured in red highlight the correlation indexes 

which absolute value is high enough (?&gt;0.5) to consider the influence of that terrain feature 

statistically significant in the respective TTOP parameter. This threshold was considered 

following the standards presented by Cohen (1988) and aforementioned in section 3.3.3.3. 

Moreover, just the statistically significant results with a logic physical relationship are 

considered later for the spatial modelling of each parameter.  

 

Air thawing and freezing indexes (Ita and Ifa) were found to be highly correlated with 

elevation; Nt was found to have an inverse correlation with the presence of moss cover; Nf is 

mainly influenced by the terrain curvature; finally, the thermal offset showed the greater 

correlation index with the Topographical Wetness index. These results about the most 

influencing factors for each TTOP parameter based on the Spearman correlation indexes are 

close to the previously expected in section 3.3.3.1.

85 

 

Note that the results of correlation between aspect and the TTOP parameters cannot be 

considered due to the small diversity of aspects in the monitoring sites (i.e all the boreholes 

are situated in locations with North or East aspects). Hence, there is no knowledge on how 

South and West aspects influence in the TTOP parameters values. 

 

4.4 Relationship functions between terrain features and TTOP parameters 

The sections below include the results of the statistical relationships functions between the 

terrain factors and model parameters which resulted to be highly correlated in previous 

section. Included as well in this section is the analysis of results of the compliance test of the 

assumptions for applicability of single or multilinear relationships functions, previously 

explained in section 3.3.3.4. 

4.4.1 THAWING AND FREEZING INDEXES 

To understand how the indexes are correlated with altitude in Cierva Point and check for the 

first assumption of “linearity”, we plotted the resulting values of Ita and Itf for the 9 different 

locations as a function of their altitude (Figures 46a and 46b). Similarly to the air temperature 

decrease with elevation, thawing degree-days decrease with altitude as well. On the contrary, 

the freezing degree-days increase with altitude.   

 

Figure 46. a) Linear relationship between Ita and elevation. b) Linear relationship between Ifa and elevation. 

a) b) 



  

86 

 

Secondly, we checked for normality of residuals in a normal P-P plot (Figures 47a and 47b). 

The distribution is normal when conforms to the diagonal normality line y=x indicated in the 

plot (Statistical Solutions, 2018c). Sometimes, small deviations can be assumed as normality, 

as long as they are not drastic. In the figure below, the distribution of the residuals for both 

graphs was close to the normality enough to consider the assumption compiled.  

  

The next assumption to check was homoscedasticity (figures 48a and 48b). Ideally, in the 

scatter plot of residuals, the data should be scattered randomly, there are points equally 

distributed above and below zero on the X axis, and to the left and right of zero on the Y axis. 

In the scatter plots below, the data is randomly scattered and does not follow any obvious 

pattern, so the assumption was considered valid.

87 

 

Finally, the absence of multicollinearity should be checked using the Spearman correlation 

matrix (correlations among all predictor variables should be less than 0.80) or the Variance 

Inflation Factor (VIF), with values needing to be lower than 10. However, as we just used one 

independent variable as a predictor for each model parameter it was not necessary to check for 

this assumption to be compiled.  

Once all the assumptions were tested, the expressions that relate the thawing and freezing 

indexes as a function of elevation (Equations 13a and 13b) were determined, based on the 

observational data collected in our study area. These functions are later used for the 

spatialization of the indexes in next section. 

 

 

4.4.2 N-FACTORS 

In order to understand how the n factors are correlated with the moss cover and curvature and 

to check for the first assumption of “linearity”, we plotted the resulting values of nt and nf for 

the 9 different locations as a function of moss-cover and curvature respectively (Figure 49a 

and 49b).  

    

?? =  ?0.627?(?????????) + 309.846 

R2=0.67 

?? =  1.602?(?????????) + 894.226

value of 1 for the presence. b) Linear relationship between nf and curvature.

88 

 

In the nt plot, the assumption “linearity” is violated, so simple linear regression cannot be 

applied to this parameter. However, a difference of 1.01 in the nt value was observed between 

adjacent monitoring sites 7-MossRock and 8-MossMoss (see Table 9), only differentiated by 

the presence or absence of moss cover. Thus, a different method was exceptionally used for 

the computation of relationship between nt and moss cover for the spatialization, as explained 

in section 3.3.3.4. The mean of nt values obtained in the moss-free monitoring sites (nt=2.08) 

was given to the moss-free areas, whereas this mean value minus 1.01 (nt=1.07) was given to 

all the areas covered by mosses.  

In the nf to curvature scatterplot (Figure 49b), we observed a poor linear correlation, where 

the nf values decrease with the increase of the curvature (i.e. the insulation of the top surface 

layer increases as the concavity of the terrain does). This relation fits to the logics of potential 

relationships mentioned in section 3.3.3.1, where concave surfaces were expected to have a 

higher potential for the snowpack accumulation than convex surfaces.  

Secondly, we checked for normality of residuals in a normal P-P plot for the nf-curvature 

relation and observed an approximately normal distribution (Figure 50).

Finally, we checked for homoscedasticity, with the scatter plot in Figure 51 showing a valid 

distribution . 

 

Once all the assumptions were tested, the relationship function between the thawing and 

freezing n-factors and elevation was determined, based on the empirical data gathered in our 

study area (Equations 14a and 14b). These functions are used for the spatialization of these 

factors in next section. 

 

 

4.4.3 THERMAL OFFSET 

Soil water content does not show the same influence on the ground thermal offset in different 

substrates. Therefore, the statistical relationships between the thermal offset and water content 

(represented as the Topographic Wetness Index - TWI) must be determined separately for 

bedrock and for peat and unconsolidated soils.

First, it was plotted the absolute thermal offset values obtained in the monitoring boreholes in 

bedrock substrates (sites 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 9) as a function of the TWI (Figure 52a). Then the 

same plot was implemented for thermal offset absolute values obtained in boreholes 

characterized by unconsolidated soils and peat substrates (4, 5 and 8) (Figure 52b). 

 

In Figure 52a, we observed a direct relationship between the thermal offset in bedrock 

substrates and the moisture content, fitting the expected results as mentioned in section 

3.3.2.1, meaning that dryer bedrock (characterized by higher thermal conductivities) show 

lower absolute values of thermal offset (see Figure 28). In figure 52b, we observed an inverse 

relationship between the thermal offset and TWI in unconsolidated soils and peat substrates. 

These results fit the expected relation mentioned in section 3.3.3.1.C, moister soils and peat 

(with higher thermal conductivities than drier soils), show lower absolute values of thermal 

offset. 

We checked for normality of residuals in a normal P-P plot as well for both substrate classes 

(Figures 53a and 53b). These plots showed an approximately normal distribution.

Finally, we checked for homoscedasticity in Figures 54a and 54b that do not show a clear 

pattern. Thus, the distribution was considered homoscedastic. 

Once all the assumptions were tested, the expressions that relate the thermal offsets as a 

function of the TWI were determined, based on the empirical data gathered in our study area 

(Equation 15a and 15b). These functions were used for the spatialization of the thermal offset 

in next section all over the study area.

4.5 Spatial distribution of TTOP parameters and the TTOP spatial model. 

Once determined the statistical relationships of the TTOP parameters with different terrain 

features, which results are presented in section 4.4, we computed the Equations 13 to 15 over 

the study area. The results are shown in Figures 55 to 59.

Figures 55 to 59 show the spatial distribution models of the TTOP parameters based on 

statistical functions topo-climatic control factors over the area of study. As expected, the 

thawing and freezing air indexes decrease and increase respectively with the altitude in our 

area of study. N-thawing factor is mainly influenced by the presence or absence of moss. This 

factor’s value gets an average value of 1.07 in the locations covered by at least 5 cm moss and 

gets an average value of 2.08 in the moss-free areas. 

The n-freezing factor drops in the areas with higher propensity to snowpack accumulation (i.e. 

more concave areas), due to the insulator properties of the snowpack. 

The thermal offset is the result of applying two different linear reggresion functions, one for 

each different kind of ground substrate (i.e bedrock or unconsolidated /peat soils). The 

absolute value of the thermal offset increases in wetter areas when the substrate is bedrock, 

but decreases in saturated areas when the substrates are unconsolidated soils or peats. 

 

In the final distribution of the TTOP (Figure 60), values attain lower values in higher altitudes 

and at unconsolidated soils and peat deposits covered by moss, rather than at lower altitude 

and bare bedrock areas. Moreover, the TTOP shows its maximum values, higher than 0 ºC 

and up to 3.5°C,  in potentially moist areas (matching with TWI?1 values in Figure 34), 

characterized, as well, by a concave topography. This means that in these areas (accounting 

for aproximately 12% of the total area), permafrost is absent and the TTOP stands for the 

temperature at the base of the seasonally thawing layer. The reason is probably related to the 

high thermal conductivity of water (which encourage to total thaw of the saturated ground in 

the summer, when the air temperatures reach positive values) and with the higher potential for 

snowpack accumulation. The minimum values of the modelled TTOP (down to -6.33°C) were 

found in the most convex areas. In these areas, the total exposition of the ground to the winds 

and solar radiation minimizes the chances of snowpack accumulation during the winter 

season, leaving the bare surface exposed to heat loss during the freezing season. In summer, 

the buffer effect of the moss formations would insulate the frozen ground dificulting to gain 

heat from the solar radiation. This facts characterize these locations with high values of n-

freezing fator and low values of n-thawing factor respectively, which in fact accounts 

negatively in the TTOP model equation (Equation 2), inducing lower lower values of TTOP.

4.6 Spatial model validation 

For a better comparisons and validation of results, the Table 13 shows both the observed 

values and the modelled spatial results of air indexes (Ita, Ifa), n-factors (nt,nf), thermal offset 

(toffset) and TTOP, including the measurement uncertainties, which propagate from 

thermistor measurement (see Table 5) through the parameters functions. It shows, as well, the 

value of local error in the estimation of the spatial parameters for each monitoring site. The 

difference between the observed and modelled values of air thawing and freezing indexes (i.e. 

the error of spatialization of these parameters) ranged between approximately 6 and 

122°Cdays in Site 4 and Site 1 respectively. The maximum error found in the spatial 

estimation of n-freezing factor was 2.24 in Site 2 and the best estimation of this parameter 

occurred in Sites 7 and 8 (nt error = 0.08). The higher error in the spatialization of the 

freezing n-factor is observed in Site 4 (nf error= 0.13) and the lowest occur in Site 2 with an 

error of 0.06.  

Sites 1 and 6 present the poorest estimations of thermal offset (error of 0.33°C), being Site 4 

characterized by the best estimation with an error of 0.02°C. 

Finally, the maximum and minimum spatial estimation errors in the TTOP were found in Site 

6 (0.51°C) and Site 1 (0.02°C), respectively. 

 

On the other hand, Table 14 compiles the mean measurement uncertainties and show them in 

contrast with the mean estimation error of each parameter for all the boreholes. The mean 

error of the spatial estimation for all the parameters is, in general, smaller than the 

measurement uncertainty in the observed data, except for the nt factor, where the error 

exceeded the measurement uncertainty in 0.24 ºC. However, the overall estimation error of 

the spatial distribution of TTOP, after computing the Equation 2 all over the study area, was 

±0.32 ºC, 0.18 ºC smaller than the mean thermistor measurement uncertainty of the observed 

TTOP (±0.50 ºC). As this magnitude of the mean overall spatial estimation error of the final 

TTOP model falls inside the margins of the measurement uncertainty, the estimation was 

considered good enough for the validation of the TTOP spatial model results.

4.7 Permafrost sensitivity to climate change in Cierva Point 

In order to evaluate the potential permafrost spatial sensitivity to climate change, it was 

implemented a TTOP model for a hypothetical scenario, where long-term mean annual air 

temperatures increase 1 ºC disregarding changes in any other topo-climatic factor, such as the 

seasonal snow pack, moss distribution or soil moisture content, as explained in section 3.5. 

The results of the distribution of the new TTOP is shown in Figure 61.

Figure 61 shows the new values of mean annual temperature at the TOP when a 1 ºC increase 

in the MAAT is considered. For each specific monitoring site, the TTOP values modelled in 

both different scenarios are labelled: 1. before the climate change (in the upper left of each 

site), and 2. After the MAAT increased 1 ºC (in bold to the right of each site). Sites 1,2,3,4,5 

and 8, even though increased its values, still maintained negative temperatures at the 

permafrost table after the variance. However, the temperature at the top of permafrost in sites 

6 and 7 increased above 0 ºC suggesting the potential disappearance of permafrost in these 

sites. Resulting positive TTOP values for these sites after the increment of the MAAT stand 

for the temperature at the base of the seasonal freezing and thawing layer (Way &amp;amp; 

Lewkowicz, 2016), under which the ground does not freeze anymore during the winter time. 

In site 9, permafrost was absent before the increment of temperature and still remained absent 

in the second scenario. 

 

In order to simplify the visualization of the TTOP model distribution in both case scenarios, 

both maps where reclassified in two different sectors: areas with TTOP &amp;lt;0 ºC and areas with 

TTOP &gt; 0 ºC (Figures 62a and 62b). Even though the depth of the permafrost table is 

unknown in most of them, areas with TTOP &amp;lt;0 ºC in both scenarios represent areas where 

permafrost is estimated to be present. Positive TTOP values correspond to cases where the 

ground still freezes and thaws seasonally, but where no permafrost occurs.  

In the scenario 1, most of the study area (around 88%) shows negative values of TTOP and 

thus indicate presence of permafrost. Permafrost-free areas, where TTOP resulted positive, 

are a minority (around 12%), that mainly occur in areas characterized by higher Topographic 

Wetness Indexes and high moisture contents (characterized by higher thermal conductivities 

that dry soils).  

When comparing with the second scenario (Figure 62b), a significant increase of the 

permafrost free areas is observed, almost the 50% of the permafrost in scenario 1 would 

disappear. Figure 63 shows the TTOP changes from scenario 1 to 2. Blue areas account for 

the 43% of the total area of interest and represent the regions where permafrost was found 

with TTOP &amp;lt;0 ºC in scenario 1 and still remained negative after the warming. Red colour 

designates the permafrost free areas (TTOP &gt; 0 ºC) in scenario 1 that remained permafrost-

free (with positive TTOP) after the climate change, and account for the 12% of the area. 

Finally, brown areas represent the regions where permafrost was present (TTOP &amp;lt;0 ºC) in 

scenario 1, but disappeared as a consequence of the climate warming in scenario 2 (45%).  



  

101 

 

The TTOP values in almost all the study area were estimated to increase in average 1.18 ºC as 

a consequence of the air temperature forcing.  

 

The areas showing a higher increase in the TTOP, and thus the most sensitive to the air 

temperature change, were the ones at lower altitudes with bare ground surfaces and/or high 

concavity. The absence of moss covers makes these areas noticeably exposed to warming 

during the summer, when solar radiation is directly absorbed by the ground. The thicker 

snowpack associated to the concavity, provides better insulation during winter, reducing heat 

losses and contributing to ground warming. The areas which still maintained permafrost after 

the air temperature increase, were mainly those at higher altitudes or the areas with a moss 

bed insulating the ground from the summer warming. Permafrost remains present in areas of 

convex topography as well, where a low potential of snow cover, leaves the ground exposed 

to high of heat losses during the winter.

5. Conclusions 

In order to evaluate permafrost climate sensitivity at Cierva Point, the ground temperature 

regimes in nine sites were analysed and the spatial distribution of the Temperature at the Top 

Of Permafrost (TTOP) was modelled.  

By analysing the temperature regime for the sites where observational data was available 

thanks to nine boreholes, permafrost was observed at depths in the range from 0.4 to 5 m 

depending on substrate, topographical and vegetation characteristics. At the deepest borehole 

in bedrock, in a site with slightly convex terrain, north aspect and at 198 m altitude, 

permafrost was found at 5 m and showed a mean annual temperature of -1.2 ºC. In a convex 

moraine area, at 166 m and north aspect, permafrost was found at 1 m depth and the 

Temperature at the Top of Permafrost was -2.6 ºC. In a low elevation site at 72 m, 

characterized by 40 cm of moss cover over a peat substrate, permafrost was found at 0.4 m, 

right below the moss layer with a TTOP of -1.4 ºC. 

In general, the estimated depths of the top of permafrost were found to be deeper (and the 

seasonal thawing layer thicker) in bedrock sites, followed by unconsolidated soils and peat 

substrates. In one of the monitored sites in bedrock and characterized by the highest wetness 

index value and located at the lowest elevation (36 m), the temperature profile suggests the 

absence of permafrost and sets the temperature at the top of the seasonally thawing and 

freezing layer at 0.32 °C. 

The ground temperature profile of the deepest borehole (15m) and its comparison with the air 

temperature regime provided some insights on the thermal impact of the snowpack on the 

ground surface temperature in this representative site. Some differences were found in the 

thermal offset values between the air and the surface during the first monitoring period from 

2012-2014 and the second monitoring period from 2016-2018. In the first period, the ground 

surface thermal regime showed a stronger decoupling from the cold air temperatures in the 

winter time, while from 2016-2018 the surface thermal regime was found to be strongly 

coupled with the atmosphere. Also, the zero-curtain effect was observed to be shorter in the 

spring of 2015 and 2017 in comparison with previous years. These observations may reflect a 

longer lasting and thicker snowpack accumulation during the winter seasons of 2012 and 

2013, which would have provided a stronger insulation to the surface for longer than the 

thinner snowpack in 2016-2018. An observed reduction of the active layer thickness in this 

site during the first two years of the dataset could be also explained by this fact. This 



  

105 

 

observation is in agreement with previous observations in nearby regions reporting a 

reduction of the active layer thickness in ice-free areas of the South Shetland Islands between 

2006 and 2014, linked with episodes of longer lasting and thicker snowpack accumulation the 

surface (Goyanes et al., 2014; Ramos et al., 2017; de Pablo et al., 2017). 

The spatial modelling of the distribution of the TTOP parameters over Cierva Point, showed 

that the air thawing and freezing indexes were observed to decrease and increase respectively 

with the altitude, being somehow related with the adiabatic lapse rate. N-thawing factor 

values were lower in locations covered by moss formations than in bare soils and bedrock. 

The n-freezing factor was found to drop in the areas with higher potential snowpack 

accumulation (i.e. more concave areas). Both these results are explained by the buffer effect 

of the moss cover and the snowpack, which act as good thermal insulators (specially during 

the winter season in the case of the latter). The absolute values of the spatially modelled 

thermal offsets showed an increase (larger difference between TTOP and mean annual surface 

temperatures) in moist areas where the substrate is bedrock, but a decrease in saturated areas, 

where the substrate are unconsolidated soils or peats. Reasons for this, may be the higher 

thermal conductivity of peats and soils when they are wet, rather that dry, and of bedrock, 

when dry.  

Values resulting from the final distribution of the Temperature in the Top of Permafrost 

(TTOP) were lower in higher altitudes and at unconsolidated soils and peat deposits covered 

by moss, rather than at lower altitude and bare bedrock areas. Moreover, the TTOP shows its 

maximum values (above 0 ºC and up to 3.5 °C),  in potentially moist areas, characterized as 

well by concave topography. This means that in these areas, permafrost is absent and the 

TTOP will stand for the temperature at the base of the seasonal thawing layer. The reason is 

probably related to the high thermal conductivity of water (which promotes the total thaw of 

the saturated ground in the summer, when the air temperatures reach positive values) and with 

the higher potential for snowpack accumulation (which acts as a thermal insulator layer, 

reducing heat losses in winter).  

Low values of TTOP were found, as well, in the most convex areas covered by moss 

formations. In these areas, the total exposition of the ground to the winds and solar radiation 

minimizes the chances of snowpack accumulation during the cold season, leaving the bare 

surface exposed to significant heat losses. In summer, the buffer effect of the moss formations 

insulates the frozen ground limiting heat gains from solar radiation. These characterize are 

typical of the locations with high values of n-freezing factor and low values of n-thawing 



  

106 

 

factor, respectively, which in fact, account negatively in the TTOP model equation (Equation 

2), inducing its lower values. 

The overall estimation error of the spatial distribution of TTOP after computing the TTOP 

model equation over the study area, was ±0.32 ºC, and hence 0.18 ºC below the mean 

thermistor measurement uncertainty of the observed TTOP (±0.50 ºC). As this magnitude of 

the mean overall spatial estimation error of the final TTOP model falls inside the margins of 

the measurement uncertainty, the estimation was considered good enough for the validation of 

the TTOP spatial model results. This estimation error magnitude accounts somehow for the 

high small-scale variability of terrain features combined with a small sample size of 

monitoring points (i.e. lack of repetition for observed data in moss-covered areas with 

underlying peats), that together with high temperature measurement uncertainties, creates a 

high probability of relation due to randomness in the estimation of statistical relationships. 

Consequently, continuous functions like the regression models used in this method, that do 

not account for this random variability at smaller scales, are sometimes likely to fail when 

trying to explain the variability of the TTOP parameters at the 1 m/pixel resolution local scale 

of the study area. Hence, in future developments, other less restrictive estimation methods 

such as regression tree analysis could be alternatively applied as included in other studies 

(Anderton et al., 2004; Watson et al., 2006). 

Finally, analysing the TTOP distribution in the hypothetical scenario of climate change, with 

a long-term mean annual air temperature increase of 1 ºC and disregarding changes in any 

other topoclimatic factors, a significant reduction of the TTOP values in the area was 

observed. The results suggest the disappearance of nearly the 50% of the permafrost estimated 

to currently exist in Cierva Point. 

The areas showing a higher increase in the TTOP, and resulted to be the most sensitive to the 

air temperature change, were the ones at lower altitudes, characterized by bare ground 

surfaces and/or high concavity. The absence of a moss cover makes these areas noticeably 

exposed to the increase of temperature during the summer, when solar radiation is directly 

absorbed by the ground. However, a thicker snowpack linked to the concave topography 

provides better insulation during the winter reducing heat loses and contributing ground 

warming. The areas which still maintained underlying permafrost after the air temperature 

increase, were those at high altitudes and or the areas counting with a top moss bed cover 

insulating the ground from the increment of temperature during the summer. Concave areas 



  

107 

 

also maintained underlain permafrost as a low potential of snow cover, leaves the ground 

exposed to high rates of heat loses during the winter. 

 

The disappearance of permafrost areas in Cierva Point may lead to significant impacts in the 

area’s ecosystem, especially on hydrology and consequently in flora and fauna. The results of 

a 1 ºC warming suggest the potential degradation of permafrost mainly at low and mid 

altitude areas, covering mostly all the areas with the greatest accumulation of moss and lichen 

colonies and penguin activity nowadays. Permafrost presence is of uppermost importance for 

the hydrology of the area, as the impermeable properties of the permanent frozen ground 

promote the pooling of rain and melt water on the surface making possible its existence. The 

thawing of permafrost in wetland areas would therefore increase the water infiltration through 

thicker soils and permeable joints, reducing the superficial water flow available for moss 

communities in the area as well. As an example, the three current existing temporary ponds 

located at the northwest side of the peninsula, situated at around 80 m altitude, may lower its 

water table resulting in possibly impacts on the penguin high activity occurring in these areas 

as well. Flora and fauna are consequently very vulnerable to changes in the permafrost 

distribution in Cierva Point.  

 

The permafrost model developed in this dissertation provides interesting insights about the 

current situation and future scenarios of ground temperatures. However, it must be taken into 

account that the model implements parameterizations on soil, vegetation and climate data, 

which encompass broad uncertainties, as land cover, soil characteristics are estimated on a 

coarse scale and interpolated for large areas.  Besides, using longer periods of dataset for the 

computation of the model may reflect a closer reality of TTOP values over the past years (as 

the final dataset used for the computation of the model was reduced to 2 years long due to the 

discontinuity of the records over the full period from 2012 to 2018). Moreover, permafrost is 

controlled by local topo-climatic factors, which may vary over small scales. The magnitude of 

the estimation error accounts somehow for the high small-scale variability of these 

topoclimatic features combined with a small sample size of monitoring points (i.e. lack of 

repetition for observed data in moss-covered areas with underlying peats). This creates a high 

probability of relation due to randomness in the estimation of statistical relationships between 

TTOP parameters and terrain features. Consequently, continuous functions like the regression 

models used in this method, that do not account for this random variability at smaller scales, 

are sometimes under the risk of failing when trying to explain the variability of the TTOP 



  

108 

 

parameters at small scales such as the 1m/pixel resolution local scale used in this project. 

Therefore, large sample datasets are crucial in order to reproduce the state of the art and future 

ground temperature regimes in permafrost regions (Solheim, 2016). 

In order to improve the precision of the model carried out in this dissertation and increase the 

dataset quality in future investigation lines, still new monitoring sites could be set up to record 

temperatures over longer continuous time periods. However, this is a logistical complex issue 

and also costly, accounting for the very remote location of Cierva Point.
