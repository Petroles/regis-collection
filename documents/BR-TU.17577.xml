 ABSTRACT 

Invasive species are one of the main threats to biodiversity worldwide, with serious impacts for the 

environment, economy and ecosystems services. Invasion ecology is a relatively recent field of 

increasing importance in environmental research and management, with a growing number of 

publications and new wide-reaching initiatives. Even so, many questions still need to be answered 

and more research is clearly needed. This work investigated several aspects of the invasion of a 

Mediterranean dune ecosystem by a Leguminosae tree, Acacia longifolia (Andrews) Willd., aiming to 

contribute to filling some specific gaps in invasion Ecology, and providing practical and useful 

management options for managers. 

The effects of A. longifolia at vegetation level, in areas with different invasion durations (stands 

invaded for more than 20 years, hereafter “long-invaded”, compared to stands invaded after a 

summer fire in 1995 – hereafter “recently invaded”) were compared, over a five-year period, with 

non-invaded situations, using multiple parameters. Results showed that the longer the invader is 

present in the system, the more pronounced are the impacts (e.g. decrease of plant cover, initial 

diversity and total species richness; fewer species shared with native areas; species traits altered) 

and the higher is the reinvasion potential due to germination of seeds of A. longifolia. Native dune 

ecosystems which were historically almost treeless were converted into highly modified systems, 

composed by almost mono-specific woodlands with a series of structural and functional changes 

which are dynamic and apparently tend to stabilize after several decades. The use of multiple 

parameters revealed that analyses including few, or only single figure parameters, concealed some 

of the changes taking place as invasions progress. 

Seed ecology of A. longifolia was studied, including quantification of the seed rain (trials with seed 

traps), measurement of seed viability through time (burial experiments) and the extent of the soil 

seed bank (soil core extraction). Copious production of seeds was measured (ca. 12 000 seeds 

falling per m-2 annually), which concentrated mostly under the A. longifolia canopies. Although many 

seeds were lost both before and after entering the soil seed bank, seeds remaining in the soil were 

still numerous (ca. 1500 and 500 seeds m-2 in long- and recently invaded stands, respectively). 

Scarce seeds were found up to 7 m from the edge of stands, indicating that outside agents facilitated 

dispersal, and new invasion foci may arise if the right stimuli occur. This source of propagules 

enables A. longifolia to rapidly reinvade areas after disturbance (e.g. deliberate removal of plants, or 

fire). The number of seeds in the soil declined through time, with only 30% surviving after 6 years, 

with lower losses at greater depths. Germinability of buried seeds that survived was low (&lt;12%) but 

viability was very high (&gt;85%). 



 

vi 

Recovery potential in long- and recently invaded stands was assessed using two distinct 

approaches: 1) soil seed banks were evaluated (seedling emergence method), comparing cleared 

plots (where both A. longifolia and its litter layer were removed) vs. uncleared plots; and 2) 

experimentally cleared plots were monitored, from 2002 to 2008 (a period that was longer than most 

removal studies), comparing A. longifolia removal with and without the underlying litter layer. Results 

of both experiments showed that the system is resilient, but less so in long-invaded areas, with many 

native plant species backing up autogenic recovery to a certain level. Nevertheless, many 

reappearing species were generalists and six years after clearing, several species and some traits 

typical from dunes were still missing (or scarce). Germination of A. longifolia seeds, as well as other 

exotics, impeded successful natural recovery, alerting that follow up interventions will be required. 

The seedling emergence method apparently gave an exaggerated impression of the extent of the 

degradation in actual field conditions, but was the only method that revealed A. longifolia seeds in 

non-invaded areas and allowed a rapid assessment of the ecosystem resilience without major 

clearing efforts. Long-term field monitoring of cleared sites provided a more detailed insight into the 

recovery potential of invaded areas, revealing more than twice the species found in the seedling 

emergence trials. However, the field trials were more expensive, time-consuming and took longer to 

furnish results. The removal of the thick litter layer (particularly in long-invaded areas) in field plots 

was cost-effective facilitating germination of more species and eliminating many A. longifolia seeds. 

Although distinct, both methods complemented each other.  

The biological control agent Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae (Australian gall forming wasp), that 

targets seed reduction of A. longifolia, and additionally curtails its vegetative growth to some level, 

has been successfully used in South Africa for more than 20 years. It was therefore screened as a 

possible candidate for use in Portugal. Specificity tests, including 40 non-target plant species, gave 

promising results, indicating that T. acaciaelongifoliae can be a safe (and cost-effective) alternative 

to other control methods currently available in Portugal. Oviposition in non-choice tests was detected 

in three non-target species but subsequent trials in potted plants and surveys in the field (in Australia 

and South Africa) showed that galls only developed on A. longifolia. Although frequently considered 

as the most sustainable and environmentally friendly methodology around the world, biological 

control of invasive plants has only been used once in Europe, in early 2010. The implications of the 

results of the screening tests are discussed and an overview of the legal procedures needed to 

secure release of T. acaciaelongifoliae in Portugal is presented. 

Synthesis: Despite the profound impacts of A. longifolia invasion on native vegetation and on seed 

banks, plant species recovery observed in the field and also soil seed bank studies showed that the 



 

vii 

dune ecosystem is still resilient to some extent. Nevertheless, system degradation is striking and 

increases with time of invasion. The risk of reinvasion is high and long-lasting, due to the numerous 

long-lived seeds of A. longifolia. The results of this investigation emphasize the need for 

management actions that are sustainable in the long-term, and indicate that this can be achieved 

with biological control by an agent that primarily targets reduction of A. longifolia seed production.

RESUMO 

A invasão por espécies exóticas é considerada uma das principais ameaças à biodiversidade à 

escala global, com graves impactes ambientais e económicos. O ramo da ecologia que se dedica ao 

estudo das invasões biológicas surgiu há pouco mais de meio século, mas tem adquirido uma 

notoriedade crescente, tanto a nível da investigação científica como a nível dos projectos de gestão 

dos problemas causados pelas espécies invasoras. O número de publicações especializadas, assim 

como os projectos de investigação e de gestão, tem aumentado de forma substancial e têm sido 

organizadas iniciativas diversas a todos os níveis de abrangência. A nível global, são exemplos o 

GISP (Global Invasive Species Programme), o GISIN (Global Invasive Species Information System) 

ou o ISSG (Invasive Species Specialist Group da IUCN, International Union for Conservation of 

Nature); a nível europeu podem referir-se a Estratégia Europeia para as Espécies Exóticas 

Invasoras, actualmente em discussão; várias comunicações oficiais da União Europeia sobre o 

problema e o projecto DAISIE (Delivering Alien Invasive Species Inventories for Europe, 

http://www.europe-aliens.org/); a nível nacional são exemplos a legislação sobre o tema – Decreto- 

Lei n.º 565/99, de 21 de Dezembro, e vários projectos de controlo de plantas invasoras em áreas 

protegidas, municipais e privadas.  

Em Portugal, assim como em muitos outros locais do mundo (e.g. África do Sul, Chile, Nova 

Zelândia, Austrália, Espanha, Brasil, Israel), várias espécies do género Acacia são consideradas 

invasoras, sendo responsáveis por impactes negativos a nível da vegetação, disponibilidade de 

água, solo, ciclos biogeoquímicos, etc. Acacia longifolia (Andrews) Willd. (acácia-de-espigas), árvore 

de origem Australiana, é uma das espécies mais problemáticas em Portugal, sendo a sua expansão 

particularmente preocupante nos ecossistemas dunares. É neste contexto que se apresenta este 

estudo sobre a invasão da Reserva Natural das Dunas de S. Jacinto por A. longifolia, cujos 

objectivos gerais são: 1) avaliação dos impactes de A. longifolia a nível da vegetação, incluindo o 

banco de sementes, 2) estudo da ecologia das sementes de A. longifolia, 3) análise da capacidade 

de recuperação do ecossistema após remoção da espécie invasora, e 4) estudo do agente de 

controlo biológico Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae (vespa-australiana-formadora-de-galhas) como 

um método de controlo alternativo para usar em Portugal contra A. longifolia. 

Para avaliar os impactes de A. longifolia a nível da vegetação (capítulo 2) monitorizaram-se, ao 

longo de cinco anos (2003-08), áreas invadidas há mais de 20 anos (acacial antigo), áreas 

invadidas após um incêndio no verão de 1995 (acacial recente) e áreas de vegetação nativa, não 



 

x 

invadidas. Analisaram-se comparativamente diversos parâmetros: riqueza específica, cobertura 

vegetal, índices de diversidade e de similaridade, curvas de abundância – dominância de diversos 

atributos funcionais e ecológicos e taxas de substituição de espécies. Os resultados mostraram que 

os impactes da espécie invasora são significativos ocorrendo, por exemplo, diminuição significativa 

da cobertura de plantas nativas, da diversidade, da equitabilidade e da riqueza específica nas áreas 

invadidas; adicionalmente, observou-se uma alteração profunda das espécies presentes implicando 

modificação dos atributos funcionais e ecológicos. Registou-se um agravamento dos impactes à 

medida que o tempo de invasão aumenta, i.e., nas áreas de acacial antigo (e.g. diminuição mais 

acentuada da cobertura vegetal nativa nas áreas de acacial antigo e menor similaridade da 

composição de espécies entre áreas de acacial antigo e as áreas nativas). Por outro lado, verificou-

se que o potencial de reinvasão, devido à germinação de sementes de A. longifolia, aumentou nas 

áreas invadidas há mais tempo. Os ecossistemas dunares em estudo, caracterizados no estado não 

invadido pela existência de diversas comunidades vegetais onde dominam espécies herbáceas, 

subarbustivas e arbustivas, foram substituídos por formações arbóreas, quase monoespecíficas, 

implicando uma série de transformações a nível da própria estrutura das comunidades e do seu 

funcionamento. Estas transformações são dinâmicas ao longo do tempo, conforme revelado pelas 

taxas de substituição de espécies, e tendem a estabilizar nas áreas invadidas há várias décadas. 

No conjunto, a análise dos vários parâmetros revelou também que o uso isolado de parâmetros 

expressos apenas por um valor (e.g. riqueza específica, cobertura vegetal) pode induzir em algumas 

interpretações menos correctas. A quantificação das alterações ocorridas devido à invasão é 

essencial, por exemplo, para complementar as análises de risco que podem fundamentar a 

classificação oficial de A. longifolia como “praga” no âmbito Europeu (Council Directive 2000/29/EC), 

ou para prioritizar áreas para gestão. 

Com o objectivo de contribuir para o maior conhecimento da ecologia das sementes de A. longifolia 

(capítulo 3), procedeu-se à quantificação da queda de sementes (através da instalação de 

armadilhas de sementes), da viabilidade das sementes ao longo de um período de seis anos 

(através de experiências de enterramento de sementes a diferentes profundidades) e da extensão 

do banco de sementes acumulado no solo (através da recolha de amostras de solo). Os resultados 

obtidos mostraram que a produção anual de sementes de A. longifolia é elevada (12 000 

sementes.m-2 em média); as sementes acumulam-se sobretudo debaixo das copas das árvores-

mãe e apresentam, logo após a queda, germinabilidade (i.e. germinação sem receberem nenhum 

estímulo) da ordem dos 30-40% e viabilidade superior a 80%. Algumas sementes foram detectadas 

a 7 m da margem do acacial, sugerindo a intervenção de agentes de dispersão externos. Muitas 



 

xi 

sementes são, no entanto, perdidas, tanto antes como depois de entrarem no banco de sementes 

(e.g. devido a germinação, granivoria ou decomposição), resultando em valores médios de ca. 1500 

e 500 sementes.m-2 acumuladas no solo de áreas de acacial antigo e de acacial recente, 

respectivamente. Apesar da perda significativa das sementes, as que são efectivamente 

acumuladas no banco de sementes são ainda numerosas sendo suficientes para reinvadir as áreas 

quando estas são sujeitas a alguma perturbação (e.g. acções de controlo, fogo). As sementes de 

A. longifolia acumuladas no banco de sementes das áreas de acacial antigo revelaram 

germinabilidades surpreendentemente baixas (&amp;lt;5%) quando comparadas com as de bancos de 

sementes das áreas de acacial recente (ca. 65%). Um padrão semelhante, apesar da diferença ser 

menos acentuada, verificou-se para a viabilidade (ca. 70% vs. quase 100% em áreas de acacial 

antigo e de acacial recente, respectivamente). As sementes enterradas experimentalmente, foram 

desaparecendo ao longo do tempo e ao fim dos seis anos apenas ca. 30% das sementes foram 

recuperadas; as sementes enterradas mais profundamente (ca. 9 cm) foram recuperadas em maior 

quantidade. A germinabilidade destas sementes foi baixa (&amp;lt;12%) mas a sua viabilidade foi muito 

elevada (&gt; 85%). Estes resultados permitiram a caracterização do potencial de invasão de 

A. longifolia fundamental para o planeamento das acções de gestão da espécie invasora. 

O potencial de recuperação de áreas de acacial antigo e de acacial recente foi avaliado recorrendo 

a duas abordagens distintas: 1. avaliação da constituição do banco de sementes (espécies nativas e 

exóticas) através do método de emergência de plântulas, em parcelas de onde A. longifolia foi 

removida juntamente com a camada de folhada e em parcelas não intervencionadas (capítulo 4); 2. 

monitorização da recuperação florística desde 2002 a 2008 (constituindo um período mais longo do 

que maior parte dos estudos similares) em áreas de onde A. longifolia foi removida 

experimentalmente, com ou sem a camada de folhada acumulada à superfície do solo (capítulo 5). 

Os resultados das duas experiências revelaram que o sistema invadido ainda é resiliente, com 

muitas espécies de plantas nativas a suportar a recuperação autogénica parcial, apesar da 

resiliência ser menor em áreas de acacial antigo. No entanto, muitas das espécies nativas que 

colonizaram as áreas são generalistas (não exclusivas do sistema dunar e algumas até associadas 

a ambiente perturbados) e seis anos após a remoção da espécie invasora várias espécies típicas, e 

alguns atributos mais frequentes, das comunidades dunares eram muito escassos ou não (re) 

apareceram de todo. Por outro lado, a germinação de A. longifolia, assim como de outras espécies 

exóticas, ameaçaram o sucesso da recuperação alertando para a necessidade de continuidade das 

acções de gestão. Os resultados do método de emergência de plântulas, parecem indicar uma 

maior degradação do sistema comparativamente com a observada nas parcelas em campo; 



 

xii 

contudo, este método revelou sementes de A. longifolia em áreas não-invadidas, o que não 

aconteceu nas parcelas em campo, e permitiu uma análise mais rápida da capacidade de 

recuperação do sistema sem a necessidade de um grande esforço/investimento em controlo. Por 

outro lado, a monitorização de longo - prazo em campo, permitiu informação mais detalhada do 

potencial de recuperação, revelando cerca do dobro das espécies detectadas no banco de 

sementes; no entanto, é uma metodologia mais dispendiosa, trabalhosa e que demora mais tempo 

até obter resultados. A remoção da camada de folhada (particularmente em áreas de acacial antigo) 

nas parcelas experimentais revelou-se vantajosa uma vez que, além de facilitar a germinação de 

mais espécies, contribuiu para eliminar muitas sementes de A. longifolia. Apesar de distintas, as 

duas abordagens complementaram-se permitindo uma análise mais completa da capacidade de 

recuperação do sistema. A análise do potencial de recuperação do sistema é fundamental para a 

definição das acções de gestão futuras, incluindo em relação à introdução de um agente de controlo 

biológico. 

Os resultados dos capítulos anteriores revelaram que o sucesso das acções de controlo é 

rapidamente comprometido devido ao numeroso banco de sementes de A. longifolia, pelo que o 

controlo mecânico por si só não é uma alternativa eficaz. Uma opção a considerar para a redução 

da produção de sementes é a utilização de agentes de controlo biológico. Apesar do controlo 

biológico ser considerado frequentemente como uma das metodologias mais sustentável e “amiga-

do-ambiente”, a nível mundial, esta tecnologia aplicada a plantas invasoras foi usada apenas uma 

vez na Europa, com a introdução em 2010 do psilídeo Aphalara itadori, para controlo da 

sanguinária-do-Japão (Fallopia japonica (Houtt) R. Decr.) no Reino Unido. No caso da A. longifolia, 

o agente de controlo biológico Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae é reconhecido como sendo mono-

específico (i.e. capaz de completar o seu ciclo de vida apenas em A. longifolia) e reduz 

significativamente a produção de sementes de A. longifolia, além de diminuir, até certo nível, o seu 

crescimento vegetativo. Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae é usado com sucesso na África do Sul, 

onde foi introduzido há mais de 20 anos, e foi testado como uma alternativa para usar em Portugal 

(capítulo 6). Os resultados dos testes de especificidade realizados, incluindo 40 espécies de plantas 

não-alvo, indicaram que T. acaciaelongifoliae pode ser uma alternativa segura (e mais económica) 

aos métodos de controlo de A. longifolia actualmente disponíveis em Portugal. Testes de oviposição 

sem-escolha revelaram deposição de ovos em três espécies não-alvo. Fases subsequentes das 

experiências, em plantas envasadas (em laboratório) e observações em campo (na Austrália e na 

África do Sul), mostraram que apenas se desenvolveram galhas, i.e., o agente conseguiu concluir o 

seu ciclo de vida, em A. longifolia. Os dados dos estudos atrás referidos (nomeadamente a 



 

xiii 

quantificação dos impactes e a caracterização da produção, viabilidade e banco de sementes de 

A. longifolia) são indispensáveis para avaliar futuramente o grau de sucesso do agente de controlo 

biológico, caso a sua libertação venha a ser autorizada. Discutem-se as implicações da utilização 

desta metodologia e apresenta-se um resumo dos procedimentos legais necessários antes da sua 

libertação. 

Síntese: apesar da invasão por A. longifolia ter impactes profundos na vegetação nativa e no 

próprio banco de sementes, a recuperação das espécies vegetais observada em campo e prevista 

através da análise do banco de sementes, revelaram que o sistema dunar em estudo ainda é 

resiliente. No entanto, a degradação do sistema dunar é significativa e agrava-se com o aumento do 

tempo de invasão. Acresce que esta degradação se repercute também num risco de reinvasão que 

é elevado devido ao banco de sementes da espécie invasora que, além de numeroso, tem 

viabilidade longa. Os resultados deste trabalho reforçam a necessidade de combater o problema de 

invasão por A. longifolia com acções de gestão de longo-prazo. Adicionalmente, indicam que uma 

das metodologias de controlo possíveis para A. longifolia é a utilização do agente de controlo 

biológico T. acaciaelongifoliae, o qual se prevê que diminua a produção de sementes de forma 

significativa e contribua para reduzir o seu crescimento vegetativo, de forma ambientalmente segura 

e economicamente sustentável.

General Introduction 

This introduction is a brief state of the art of key issues on biological invasions (e.g. terminology 

issues, species characteristics, invasive alien species impacts), also focusing in some specific topics 

related to the five main chapters of this thesis (chapters 2 to 6). In order to make the geographic 

context of the problem, the situation is characterized in Europe and then in Portugal. A particular 

importance is then given to IAS management as one of the underlying goals of this work is to provide 

useful information for managers. Finally, the species and the ecosystem in study are characterized. 

Subjects that are depicted in detail in each of the five main chapters were in most cases excluded in 

order to avoid much repetition.

INVASIVE SPECIES: AN OVERVIEW 

State of the art  

Biological invasions mediated by human activities are a huge source of change in ecosystems, with 

escalating impacts, both ecological and economic, worldwide (Brooks et al., 2004; Rejmánek et al., 

2005; Mason, French &amp;amp; Russell, 2007; Yelenik, Stock &amp;amp; Richardson, 2007; Batten, Scow &amp;amp; 

Espeland, 2008; Marchante et al., 2008b; Gaertner et al., 2009; Jäger, Kowarik &amp;amp; Tye, 2009; Pejchar 

&amp;amp; Mooney, 2010; Pyšek &amp;amp; Richardson, 2010; Vilá et al., 2010), often resulting in an “invasional 

meltdown” 1 (sensu Simberloff &amp;amp; Von Holle, 1999). The origin of biological invasions is lost in time 

with some authors pointing to Late Devonian (Stigall, 2010). Nevertheless, it has increased 

consistently under human-mediation, reaching a peak in the second half of the 20th century (Pyšek &amp;amp; 

Richardson, 2010) when it gained “formal” recognition in the late 1950s with the pioneering work of 

Charles Elton (Elton, 1958), often considered as the “father of Invasion Biology” (Richardson &amp;amp; 

Pyšek, 2008). Scientists, politicians and Global Organizations (Ministério do Ambiente, 1999; 

Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005; Commission of the European Communities, 2008; 

ISSG/IUCN, 2008; Pyšek &amp;amp; Richardson, 2010; TEEB, 2010) all recognize that invasive species 

damage ecosystem services, disrupt human well-being and threaten biodiversity. Ecosystem 

services affected by invasive species include supporting (e.g. alteration of succession patterns and 

soil and nutrient cycling), provisioning (e.g. threats to native species, alteration of genetic resources), 

regulating (e.g. changing pollination services and fire regimes) and cultural services (e.g. effects on 

ecotourism, changes in perception of landscape) (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005; Vilá et 

al., 2010). The alterations that occur at one trophic level may have repercussions into several other 

trophic levels (e.g. alterations in plant communities affect herbivores and parasitoids which are 

interlinked in food webs) amplifying the more frequently measured impacts of invasive alien species 

(IAS) (Carvalheiro, Buckley &amp;amp; Memmott, 2010). 

Invasive species are reported to rank as the second agent of species endangerment and extinction 

(Pejchar &amp;amp; Mooney, 2010). Nevertheless, and despite the unquestionably extensive and profound 

impacts of IAS, there is no quantitative data that supports this universal ranking. Such level of threat 

has been justified for particular systems and taxonomic groups, where invasive species may even be  

 Invasional meltdown refers to the interactions among invaders that accelerate invasions and amplify their effects on 

native communities

the predominant threat (Miller, 1989; Wilcove et al., 1998). On a global scale, it is more correct to 

include biological invasions amongst the five mains causes of biodiversity decline (Millennium 

Ecosystem Assessment, 2005).  

Invasive alien species (see Table 1.1 for definitions) are found amongst all living organisms, 

including many plants, animals and microrganisms (Elton, 1958; Vitousek, 2001; Perrings, Mooney &amp;amp; 

Williamson, 2010). Some of those species are “born” invaders (i.e. without major limitations on their 

adaptation to new environments) others are “made” invaders (i.e. evolve after being introduced in the 

new environment in order to adapt and become more fit) (Pyšek &amp;amp; Richardson, 2010). This work 

focuses on invasive plants, in particular the Leguminosae tree Acacia longifolia. 

Table 1.1 Main concepts and definitions used in plant invasion biology (source Richardson et al., 2000). 
Concept  Definition  

Exotic, alien, aloctonous, 
non-native, non-
indigenous 
 

Plant taxa whose presence in a given area is due to introduction, intentional or 
accidental, as a result of human activity. 

Casual, occasional 
escape, transient 
 

Subset of alien plants that may flourish, and even reproduce occasionally in an 
area, but which do not form self-replacing populations, and which rely on 
repeated introductions to persist. 
 

Naturalized, sub- 
spontaneous 

Subset of alien plant that reproduce consistently and sustain populations over 
many life cycles without direct intervention by humans (or in spite of human 
intervention); often recruit offspring freely, usually close to adult plants, and do 
not necessarily spread into natural, semi-natural or human-made ecosystems. 
 

Invasive, environmental 
weed 

Subset of naturalized plants that produce reproductive offspring, often in very 
large numbers, at considerable distances from parent plants (approximate 
scales: &gt; 100 m; &amp;lt;50 years for taxa spreading by seeds and other propagules; 
&gt; 6 m/3 years for taxa spreading by roots, rhizomes, stolons, or creeping 
stems), and thus have the potential to spread over a considerable area; 
frequently adversely affecting native biodiversity and/or ecosystem functioning. 
 

Transformer   Subset of invasive plants which change the character, condition, form or nature 
of ecosystems over a substantial area relative to the extent of that ecosystem. 
 

Weeds, plant pests, 
harmful species 

Plants (not necessarily exotic) that grow in sites where they are not wanted by 
humans and which usually have detectable economic or environmental effects.  

 

Invasive alien species are a small fraction of exotic species that are increasingly moved around the 

world, intentionally or accidentally, crossing geographic barriers (and then a series of environmental 

and other barriers, see Figure 1.5 and Richardson et al. (2000) for more details) that had once 

limited their distribution to their natural ranges. Often, such species are moved without carrying the 



 

6 

natural enemies that in their native environment are one of the factors contributing to keeping them 

in check - enemy release hypothesis ERH (Keane &amp;amp; Crawley, 2002). ERH when associated with 

some species traits, e.g. prolific seed production, efficient mechanisms of dispersal, high growth 

rates, plasticity, altogether facilitate a plant species becoming invasive. Some invasive species are 

able to significantly modify the ecosystems over a substantial area; these are named transformers 

(Richardson et al., 2000). 

Some of the characteristics of the species, e.g. prolific production of seeds which accumulate in 

long-lived, viable seed banks, are particularly important, because besides being responsible for initial 

invasion they ensure persistence into the future by allowing resurgence after control efforts or other 

forms of disturbance. Whether a species is invasive or not depends not only on the characteristics of 

the species but also on the characteristics of the new environment itself including factors such as 

resources availability, levels of antagonist species (e.g. predators, herbivores, pathogens) and 

intactness of the system. Propagule pressure (i.e. introduction effort), other human activities 

(reflected in variables such as Human wealth and demography), and intensity of disturbance (Essl et 

al., 2010; Perrings, Mooney &amp;amp; Williamson, 2010; Pyšek et al., 2010) can also play an important role 

in the process of whether or not a species will become invasive.  

Although some ecosystems are intrinsically more susceptible to invasion than others, disturbance, 

fragmentation and changes in land-use are known to greatly increase ecosystems vulnerability to 

invasion, even with the same activity affecting different ecosystems types in distinct ways (Pyšek, 

Chytrý &amp;amp; Vojtech, 2010). Other authors (Blossey &amp;amp; Notzold, 1995) noted another factor, expressed 

as the EICA (Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability) hypothesis, according to which, species, 

after introduced into a new location, evolve and adapt to the new environment being able to 

reallocate resources in order to gain competitive advantage. This hypothesis makes it more difficult 

to predict which species will became invasive because unpredicted evolution, following introduction, 

can make a difference. 

The time lag between the introduction of a species and the revelation of its invasive behaviour can 

be extremely variable. Even so, a recent study highlights that many of the most problematic invasive 

species (for all major taxonomic groups) are species that were introduced several decades ago, 

calling it an “invasion debt” and alerting to the fact that current human activities (including 

globalization and economic growth) will have their consequences on the extent of biological 

invasions several decades into the future (Essl et al., 2010).  



 

7 

The economic and ecological dimensions of biological invasions are interconnected and are far 

reaching. The changes in ecosystems that frequently increase their susceptibility to invasion impacts 

(e.g. disturbance, habitat fragmentation) are frequently economically mediated; and the resulting 

ecological impacts (normally considered as externalities to the economic activities and as such not 

taken into account by its promoters) have direct implications on the “natural capital” with 

repercussions which are manifest as economical problems. An increasing number of regional trade 

agreements (more than 420 reported to the World Trade Organization) aim to reduce barriers to 

movement of commodities and people, associated with increased trade, transport and travel all over 

the world (as a result of globalization). Although these agreements have many benefits for human 

well-being, they are increasingly facilitating the introduction of more species (some new, others 

already problematic), and consequently increasing probabilities of establishment and dispersal of 

such species (Perrings, Mooney &amp;amp; Williamson, 2010). Additional problems arise from the ever-

increasing online trade, which facilitates unregulated movement of species, including invasives, to 

virtually every part of the globe (Derraik &amp;amp; Phillips, 2010). 

Economic impacts of IAS, measured so far, include mainly management costs and also losses to 

provisioning ecosystem services (Pimentel, Zuniga &amp;amp; Morrison, 2005; Pejchar &amp;amp; Mooney, 2010; Vilá 

et al., 2010). Some of these costs could be partially balanced /attenuated if probability of success of 

costly management options was first evaluated, in a systematic manner, in order to weigh the 

possibility of “doing nothing” against the management actions and thus avoiding some of the huge 

funding efforts in systems without clear chances of success. 

Besides environmental and economic effects of IAS, cultural impacts, centred in human uses and 

traditions, are quite diverse being possible to find invasive species culturally impoverishing (i.e. imply 

loss or replacement of culturally important native species), culturally enriching (i.e. augment cultural 

traditions), or culturally facilitating (i.e. continuity and reformulation of traditional ethnobiological 

practices) (Pfeiffer &amp;amp; Voeks, 2008). When considering management of invasive species, all these 

dimensions of impacts have to be balanced in an integrative way. 

 

Invasive alien species in Europe - where do we stand? 

“Invasive alien species are currently among the most urgent nature conservation issues to be faced 

in the European Union and many important steps are being undertaken to develop an adequate 

strategy to deal with this problem” in Scalera (2010) 



 

8 

 

Europe in general was perceived until recently as being a major source of invasive species for other 

regions of the world but not receiving many species nor having major problems with invasive 

species. This concept has changed greatly after a continent wide assessment made by the DAISIE 

project (http://www.europe-aliens.org/). DAISIE revealed over 11 000 alien species reported 

including terrestrial plants, invertebrates and vertebrates, freshwater and marine flora and fauna. Of 

these, over half of the species are terrestrial plants. A recent assessment aiming to foresee the 

distributions of invasive species across habitats in Europe, predicted that the highest levels of 

invasion occur in disturbed habitats (agricultural, urban and industrial land-cover classes), while low 

levels occur in natural and semi-natural grasslands and woodlands, and the lowest levels in 

sclerophyllous vegetation, heathlands and peatlands (Chytrý et al., 2009). The same study predicted 

that lowland areas of the temperate zone of western and central Europe have high levels of invasion 

while boreal zone, mountain regions across the Europe and Mediterranean region (except its 

coastline, river corridors and areas with irrigated agricultural land) have low levels of invasion.  

A rough assessment of impacts, continental wide, estimated that financial costs are over €10 billion 

annually (Hulme et al., 2009), including mainly management costs, such as eradication, control, 

monitoring and environmental education programs, and also losses to provisioning ecosystem 

services (Vilá et al., 2010). Approximately 300 projects addressing IAS have been funded by the 

European Commission (EC), over the last 15 years, with a total budget exceeding €132 million 

(Scalera, 2010). These included projects financed by LIFE Programme and Framework Programmes 

for Research and Technological Development (FPs), with a higher investment on research than on 

management actions. Terrestrial plants and invertebrates include the majority of species with 

impacts although economic and environmental impacts are known for only 11-13% of the species 

(documented ecological impacts for 1094 species and economic impacts for 1347 species, including 

all taxonomic groups (Vilá et al., 2010).  

Invasive plants, in particular, have more ecological impacts reported in Europe than economic 

impacts, because of difficulty in to attributing market-based costs to ecological impacts measured.  

Although there are several commitments and agreements underpinned by international European 

organizations (e.g. EPPO and the EU itself), a specific European strategy and dedicated financial 

instrument targeting IAS is still missing (Scalera, 2010). Little has translated into action (e.g. 

prevention of new introductions, successful management actions) and IAS problems keep increasing 

(Hulme et al., 2009). Several issues make it difficult for Europe to achieve such action at a 

continental scale; e.g., the single market policy that removed the barriers to movement of 



 

9 

commodities and people, the lack of a “European species blacklist” that would have to consider 

regional lists (as many species are native in some European countries while exotic in others e.g. 

Rhododendron ponticum L. which is native in Portugal and invasive in the UK) and climatic zones (as 

some species are invasive in some areas but are climatically constrained in others). Lack of 

information for the majority of the species also complicate efforts because would be needed for 

complete risk assessments that would allow listing some of the worst species as “official pests” 

(Council Directive 2000/29/EC). 

 

Portugal in more detail 

There are over 820 exotic species in Portugal, including terrestrial and aquatic animals and plants 

and fungi; exotic terrestrial plants and insects are the most numerous (Table 1.2) (DAISIE, 2008). 

Amongst these, many are invasive and perceived as widespread and causing major ecological 

(Almeida &amp;amp; Freitas, 2001; Marchante, 2001; Campos, Rocha &amp;amp; Tavares, 2002; Aguiar et al., 2005; 

Anastácio, Parente &amp;amp; Correia, 2005; Fernandes, 2008; Marchante et al., 2008b, a; Sousa et al., 

2008; Hellmann et al., 2010) and economic impacts (Scalera &amp;amp; Zaghi, 2004). Invasive species are 

legally recognized since 1999 by Decreto-Lei n.º 565/99 de 21 de Dezembro, which forbids the use 

of species that are listed as invasive. The list of species needs to be updated as several problematic 

invasive species are not yet included. Controversially, other legal instruments seem to neglect the 

problem, e.g. some exotic invasive species such as Paspalum spp. have a conservation status due 

to be considered indicators of habitats protected by Natura 2000 Network (Decreto-Lei nº 140/99 de 

24 de Abril – Anexo B-1; Directiva 92/43/CEE – Anexo I).

Some of the more widespread and injurious invasive animals in Portugal are the Louisiana crayfish 

(Procambarus clarkii), pinewood nematode (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) and the Asian clam 



 

10 

(Corbicula fluminea) (Anastácio, Parente &amp;amp; Correia, 2005; Naves, Camacho &amp;amp; de Sousa, 2006; 

Sousa et al., 2008). Invasive plants are more numerous than animals, and probably better studied, 

with invasive plant species publications becoming increasingly more frequent (Marchante, Marchante 

&amp;amp; Freitas, 2003; Peperkorn, Werner &amp;amp; Beyschlag, 2005; Aguiar, Ferreira &amp;amp; Albuquerque, 2006; 

Almeida &amp;amp; Freitas, 2006; Aguiar et al., 2007; Ferreira, Máguas &amp;amp; Martins-Loução, 2007; Rodríguez-

Echeverría, Crisóstomo &amp;amp; Freitas, 2007; Fernandes, 2008; Marchante et al., 2008b, 2009), including 

several studies quantifying impacts at different levels. Compared with other European countries, 

Portugal has more invasive tree species than most of the northern countries (DAISIE, 2008), which 

sometimes results in more extreme changes at the landscapes. 

Over 550 exotic plant species (including only casuals, naturalized and invasive) are considered to be 

introduced in Portugal (Almeida &amp;amp; Freitas, 2006), being rather well characterized regarding 

introduction time and pathways, native range and taxonomy (Almeida, 1999; Marchante, Freitas &amp;amp; 

Marchante, 2008). Their native ranges include regions all around the world, with over 70 species 

originating from each of the Americas’, Eurasia; other regions of Europe and Africa (Almeida, 1999). 

Nevertheless, Australasia despite being the native range of fewer species, is home to a substantial 

proportion of the most problematic species in Portugal, such as Acacia spp., Hakea spp. and 

Pittosporum undulatum Vent. (Santo &amp;amp; Arsénio, 1999; Campos, Rocha &amp;amp; Tavares, 2002; Fernandes, 

2008; Marchante, Freitas &amp;amp; Marchante, 2008). 

Most of the exotic plant species (ca. 50%) were introduced as ornamentals (Figure 1.1), with 

agri/horticulture also accounting for a substantial number of introductions. This pathway is still 

“active” with new species being introduced every year. About 1/6 of the species were accidentally 

introduced, which corresponds to numerous cases of agricultural weeds whose seeds were acquired 

unintentionally with crop seeds (Almeida &amp;amp; Freitas, 2000).

50) were introduced by more than one pathway and are included more than once in the graphic. Species 
strictly limited to cultivation are nit included.

Amongst the vast taxonomic diversity (110 families) of the exotic plant species present in the 

country, several families are absent from the Portuguese native flora (e.g. Oxalidaceae, Proteaceae, 

Pittosporaceae) and many species are grouped in just a few families - Asteraceae, Fabaceae and 

Poaceae, each contributing with over (or close to) 10% of the species (Almeida &amp;amp; Freitas, 2006). 

Exotic plant species occur in a wide range of Portuguese habitats with some of the more humanized 

and disturbed habitats (I1 and J4 – Table 1.3) (Almeida, 1999; H. Marchante et al., unpublished 

data) having more species, reflecting the pattern of plant invasions distribution predicted for Europe 

(Chytrý et al., 2009). Many species are also present in other habitats, including the coastal sand 

dunes (48 species) and littoral zone of inland water bodies (70 species) (Moreira et al., 2002; Aguiar, 

Ferreira &amp;amp; Albuquerque, 2006; Aguiar et al., 2007; Marchante, Freitas &amp;amp; Marchante, 2008). 

Table 1.3 Habitats where exotic plant species are present in Portugal, according to the EUNIS classification 
(Almeida, 1999; H. Marchante et al, unpublished data). Ca. 200 species occur in more than one habitat.

The areas that have registered the introduction of most exotic plant species are the heavily 

populated coastal areas, namely Estremadura (335 species), Beira Litoral (255 species) and Douro 

Litoral (208 species) (Figure 1.2), which confirms the strong human factor associated with IAS 

problem.

recorded in each province of Portugal (based 
on Almeida, 1999). Despite provinces are no 
longer recognised as administrative regions 
in Portugal they were used because data 
from several Flora refer to these regions. 

 

The attribution of a status to the exotic species is neither consensual, nor completely objective, nor 

static in time. Even so, an exercise (H. Marchante et al., unpublished data) aiming to classify the 

exotic plant species occurring in Portugal reveals that most of the species appear as naturalized or 

casuals and ca. 10% reveal invasive behaviour (Figure 1.3).

Under a panorama of so many exotic and/or invasive species, it is particularly important to be aware 

of what are the management options.

How to manage biological invasions? 

The problem of biological invasions is complex. It integrates many factors (e.g. climate change, 

globalization, species and habitats characteristics, human actions), creates conflict of interests (e.g. 

World Trade Organization, ornamental commerce, wood industries vs. restrictions to species 

utilization due to their invasiveness), involves technical challenges (e.g. control of online trade, 

finding effective control strategies, accurate taxonomic identification) and is aggravated by a 

generalized lack of public awareness (e.g. who can have active roles, either promoting new 

introductions or controlling existing invasive species), often amongst stakeholders and managers 

(Andreu, Vilá &amp;amp; Hulme, 2009; Pyšek &amp;amp; Richardson, 2010). As such, management of biological 

invasions demands well planed, integrative actions, designed for several years, frequently even 

decades, with the underlying need of continuous funding (Wittenberg &amp;amp; Cock, 2005). A fundamental 

factor that has to be considered as a baseline on IAS management is habitat disturbance which 

frequently works as a facilitator of invasion (Hulme, 2006) and needs to be mitigated. Research 

targeting effective management practices is also of major importance but, above all, it’s important 

that it reaches managers and is applied in the field, which frequently fails to happen (Hulme, 2006; 

Andreu, Vilá &amp;amp; Hulme, 2009). Another major issue in invasion biology, which is crucial in all stages of 

management, is the accurate identification of species as misidentifications can have very serious 

consequences. 

Management of invasive species should integrate a sequence of “key steps”, some of them more 

cost-effective and promising in terms of achieving lasting and successful results than others, 

including: (1) prevention; (2) early detection and rapid response; (3) eradication; (4) containment; (5) 

control; (6) restoration and mitigation; (7) monitoring and evaluation (Wittenberg &amp;amp; Cock, 2005; 

Hulme, 2006; Pyšek &amp;amp; Richardson, 2010). Several of these steps are sequential, but not necessarily 

all, as some of them may be simultaneously applied (e.g. sequential steps with the subsequent 

taking place when the previous fails 1 ? 2 ? 3 ? 4 ? 5 ? 6 ? 7 as opposed to simultaneous 

application of several options 1 ? 2 ? 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 ? 7) (Figure 1.5).

Figure 1. 5 Introduction-invasion continuum (A, C). Amongst all the species introduced only a limited number 
(D) will cross several barriers (B) becoming invasive; if a species establishes successfully it will have impacts 
(E); management actions (F) have to be set according to each invasion phase. Impacts (E) include even 
subtle changes that result from the species entering the system but that are not always easily perceived. The 
zones of management options (F) are approximate and some may overlap more than represented: e.g. 
prevention is crucial before introduction but may continue afterwards in order to prevent increased spread; 
eradication has higher probability of success prior to naturalization but can be achieved in the earliest phase 
of expansion; management options only apply to the species that are or have high potential to be invasive 
(based on Hulme (2006), Grice (2009) and Pyšek &amp;amp; Richardson (2010)). 

Before embarking in expensive management options it is essential to prioritize the management 

actions, the species and the areas, taking into consideration factors such as the level of impacts, 

probabilities of success, value of ecosystem after recovery and available resources (Hulme, 2006). 

This is not straightforward and it is often additionally complicated by the existence of species in 

distinct stages of invasion, requiring distinct management options to be applied at the same time 

(Hulme, 2006; Pyšek &amp;amp; Richardson, 2010). Above all, there are no miraculous solutions and the easy 

options are rare. To achieve suitable levels of success, persistence and, as far as is possible, 

scientific-based decisions are essential. 



 

16 

Prevention 

Preventing the introduction of species with high risk of becoming invasive is one of the most cost-

effective management strategies (Pyšek &amp;amp; Richardson, 2010). Several actions are considered in 

prevention, such as risk assessment, border interception, pathway and vector management, 

legislative frameworks and public awareness. Some of these options are discussed below; public 

awareness is discussed afterwards due to its crucial and transverse role in several other 

management options. 

Risk assessment of an alien species potentially invasive is the determination of the likelihood that the 

species might be introduced into a region (intentionally or accidentally), establish itself and become 

invasive (Figure 5) with considerable undesired impacts (Stohlgren &amp;amp; Jarnevich, 2009; Pyšek &amp;amp; 

Richardson, 2010). Basically, risk assessment procedures involves information gathering which aims 

to characterize the invasiveness of the species, the invasibility of habitats of introduction, the 

potential distribution and undesired effects to the environment, human-health and economy 

(Stohlgren &amp;amp; Schnase, 2006). If the risk assessment scores a species as representing high risk then 

action should be put in place to prevent that species from entering/spreading in the country/region. 

With this aim, risk assessment have been mainly applied pre-border, although it may also be applied 

afterwards, e.g. to develop invasion risk maps (Chytrý et al., 2009) or to prioritize invasive species 

(Stohlgren &amp;amp; Jarnevich, 2009). Risk assessment is also one of the procedures frequently needed to 

support the decision of granting permission to release an exotic biological control agent (EPPO, 

2009).  

Increasing availability of databases of introduced species (e.g. Global Invasive Species Database, 

http://www.issg.org/database/welcome/; Rod Randall's Big Weed List, http://www.invasive.org/gist/ 

biglist.html) has contributed to increasing accuracy rates of screening procedures. Some of them, 

e.g. Australian weed risk assessment (WRA), may be applied almost universally (within taxonomic 

groups), but with some modification needed (Gordon et al., 2008; 2010; McClay et al., 2010). 

Previous history of invasion elsewhere is one of the fundamental components of risk assessment, 

although screening procedures can identify high risk species which have no previous invasive record 

(Pyšek &amp;amp; Richardson, 2010).  

Pathway and vector management is one of the key mechanisms for reducing unwanted introductions 

(Pyšek &amp;amp; Richardson, 2010). Identifying the pathways and vectors of introduction and dissemination 

of alien species allows adoption of proactive measures (e.g. targeting specific pathways to be 

monitored) that will reduce propagule pressure and consequently the likelihood of establishment and 

spread. For instance, one of the major pathways of dispersal for plants is commercial trade in 



 

17 

ornamental species. Realising this focuses public awareness on finding alternatives for ornamental 

invasive plant species and development of legal frameworks to limit introductions. Nevertheless, 

pathways are numerous and the enormous volume of trade in commodities makes the goal of 

intercepting all the potentially problematic species almost impossible (Pyšek &amp;amp; Richardson, 2010). 

With this in mind it is easy to understand that additional management options are needed for the 

species that successfully cross this “stage”. 

Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) 

For species that are introduced or keep actively spreading, the most effective way of minimizing 

impacts is to detect new introductions, small invasions or spreading propagules of species already 

spread as early as possible, when populations are still localized, and quickly put in place procedures 

to eradicate, contain or control them (Holcombe &amp;amp; Stohlgren, 2009). Considering the expansive 

range of organisms that can be introduced and are potentially invasive (from microrganisms to large 

plants and animals), the difficulties of accurate taxonomic identification, the difficulty of detecting 

individuals in low numbers and the vast areas that can/need to be monitored, the probabilities of 

early detection of an invasive species are very low (Hulme, 2006; Gordon et al., 2010; Pyšek &amp;amp; 

Richardson, 2010). Nevertheless, EDRR is highly cost-effective, justifying major research and 

management efforts to improve protocols and techniques. These processes include, for instance, (1) 

use of remote sensing to monitor and map species, (2) modelling potential distribution maps to target 

areas with higher probability of incursions, and (3) development of user-friendly identification guides 

and high-tech diagnostic tool (e.g. DNA bar-coding ) (Pyšek &amp;amp; Richardson, 2010).  

Early detection should set priorities, regarding species (e.g. watch lists) and areas (e.g. habitats with 

higher conservation value or areas that are more prone to invasion) in order to increase efficiency. 

Small invasion foci should be targeted first as they have increased invasion potential, because that 

will more efficiently slow the spread than if expansive populations were targeted (Rejmánek &amp;amp; 

Pitcairn, 2002). Rapid response should start with a quick inventory of the populations which is 

essential to avoid missing isolated patches or individuals that can then nullify the possibility of 

eradication. Additionally, it is essential that the infrastructure is in place, including control strategies, 

monitoring schemes, funding and human resources. Public awareness, including species 

identification skills, can be a major ally (Holcombe &amp;amp; Stohlgren, 2009). 

Eradication  

Eradication is the elimination of all the individuals of a species (including the seed-bank) within the 

management unit (e.g. country, conservation area) (Parkes &amp;amp; Panetta, 2009). It is more commonly 



 

18 

applied to species with limited ranges and is a cost-effective option because, if successful, it 

precludes negative impacts before they appear. Nevertheless, it is difficult to implement because 

managers/ stakeholders frequently cannot be persuaded to act upon species that are not yet a 

problem in their lands/areas (Parkes &amp;amp; Panetta, 2009; Pyšek &amp;amp; Richardson, 2010). 

Eradication should only be attempted if it is considered to be feasible to avoid failure and associated 

wasted effort and financial costs. To be considered feasible, it should ideally meet three criteria: (1) 

the average annual rate of increase of the population should be lower than the average annual long-

term removal rate, not forgetting that funding has to be guaranteed; (2) there is not a source of new 

propagules; and (3) there are not adverse effects of the removal of the species (e.g. increase of 

other exotic species) that outweigh the benefits of removing the target plant (Parkes &amp;amp; Panetta, 

2009). The potential impacts of the species if not eradicated should also be included in the analysis 

of feasibility. Regarding the feasibility of eradication, experiments showed that areas &amp;lt;1 ha are likely 

to be eradicated, areas of 1-100 ha are expected to succeed in only about 33% of attempted areas 

and for larger areas expected success is low (Rejmánek &amp;amp; Pitcairn, 2002). Commonly, costs of 

invasive plants eradication increase exponentially as the area of invasion expands (Parkes &amp;amp; 

Panetta, 2009). 

Once eradication is no longer feasible, containment and control are the most obvious options; both 

should be planned and developed as long-term strategies, with special care given to guaranteeing 

resources and continued participation of the various stakeholders (Grice, 2009). In general, the 

earlier the operations commence the higher is the likelihood of them being successful and the more 

cost-effective they become. Prioritization of species and places should be defined but this may be 

complicated by conflict of interests amongst stakeholders. Several scenarios are possible, from 

directing efforts to regions with lower abundance of the species (because this is a more cost-

effective option that will avoid, or at least delay, impacts from getting worse) to directing efforts 

toward places with higher abundance of the species, which are already highly degraded, aiming to 

prevent spread into surrounding areas. Another alternative is to focus efforts on areas of particular 

interest (e.g. conservation) irrespective of the abundance of the invader or the costs. In such areas a 

multiple invasive species management approach can be considered (Grice, 2009). 

Containment  

Containment aims to limit the spread of an invasive species through management strategies applied 

to the periphery of its range, in order to prevent its range from reaching its full potential (Kriticos, 

Alexander &amp;amp; Kolometz, 2006). Natural barriers to range expansion (e.g. mountains, rivers,…) can 



 

19 

and should be exploited. Containment can be considered partial if, instead of limiting spread entirely, 

it attempts to slow the rate of spread (Cacho, 2004). In either case, it can be applied to distinct 

management units (e.g. country, conservation area) as long as the species is expanding its range 

and curtailing its expansion is still a possibility (Grice, 2009). When the area occupied by a species is 

very large and composed of distinct smaller units, the periphery gets larger and the option to control 

becomes more realistic than to contain. Containment is more appropriate to species that disperse 

slowly and over short-distances and for which effective barriers can be set in place (Hulme, 2006). A 

containment programme should include a series of activities such as 1) accurate identification of the 

species, 2) establishment of a scheme to detect the target species outside the range where it is 

being contained, 3) planned subsequent activities to remove it if detected, and 4) adequate policies 

and proper implementation of species management (Grice, 2009). 

Control  

Control activities aim to reduce the impact and the abundance of an invasive species to an 

acceptable level in the long-term but, unlike containment, not necessarily limit its range (Hulme, 

2006; Grice, 2009). The balance between perceived or predicted impacts as opposed to predicted 

costs of control, the stage of invasion and the availability of effective control measures determine 

whether control is the best option (Grice, 2009). Predicting the impact of a species is also a 

fundamental, though difficult, aspect in making the decision for control (as opposed to eradicate or 

contain). Incomplete knowledge (e.g. predicting impacts) should not delay the process as an early 

response can be critical in achieving success. To achieve a satisfactory level of control, the 

operation should include three levels: 1) initial control, which aims at drastic reduction of the invasive 

target species, which is usually very costly; 2) follow-up control, aiming to reduce any reinvasion 

after the initial control, which can include seedlings, root suckers and coppice; and 3) maintenance 

control to sustain the invader at reduced levels, usually at lower costs and at long term (Campbell, 

1993). In the case of plants, knowledge of seed longevity, germination requirements, capacity for 

vegetative reproduction and time to first reproduction determines how long the cleared area should 

be monitored to set follow-up (and latter, maintenance) control in place (Grice, 2009). 

For eradication, control and containment, methods applied include mechanical, chemical, and 

biological control, habitat management and integrated management. In the context of this study, the 

focus will be on biological control (see section below). 



 

20 

Restoration and Mitigation  

Mitigation, in its strict sense, focuses on the affected native species rather than in the invasive 

species (Wittenberg &amp;amp; Cock, 2001). The interventions of restoration and mitigation range from the 

simple removal of an invasive species to a variety of options that aims to favour natives, or even 

more complex options that involve engineering, native species reintroduction or translocation of a 

viable population of the endangered species to a “healthy”, non-invaded ecosystem (Wittenberg &amp;amp; 

Cock, 2001). Efforts are often complicated by interacting impacts which may create novel functions 

within the system resulting in unpredictable reactions after control (e.g. secondary invasions, 

elevated levels of nitrogen following invasion that will remain after control and preclude natives, 

natives being damaged by control because had became reliant on the invasive species) (Pyšek &amp;amp; 

Richardson, 2010). All these issues have to be considered cautiously when planning interventions in 

order to avoid, or at least decrease, unwanted effects. 

“Do nothing” as an option  

When resources are scarce or no effective control measures are available, or when the degradation 

is already so profound that 

chances of successful 

recovery are very low or even 

nonexistent (see Box 1.1), 

doing nothing can be the best 

option, at least until some of 

the above scenarios change. 

This approach will avoid 

wasting resources that can be 

most effectively used into 

other areas or management 

actions. “Do nothing” about 

invasive species 

management, i.e. choosing to 

“live with the problem”, does 

not mean that mitigation actions should not take place.  

Several authors advocate that in many ecosystems, but 
particularly in the ones where human intervention is particularly 
high, transformations are such that restoration of invaded 
habitats aiming to recover the original system in pristine 
condition is not a realistic or even possible goal (Hobbs et al., 
2006; Richardson et al., 2007; Hobbs, Higgs &amp;amp; Harris, 2009; 
Pyšek &amp;amp; Richardson, 2010). In such drastically changed 
ecosystems the difficulty of removing the invaders may require 
a more pragmatic analysis with invaders considered as species 
that change their ranges and the communities into which they 
are introduced, and may even be needed to guarantee some 
ecosystems services (Walther et al., 2009). As such, it is almost 
inevitable that new ecosystems will have to be developed as 
“novel ecosystems” or “emerging ecosystems”. The possible 
outcomes of restoration may be hybrid systems with some of 
the characteristics of the previous system and other novel 
elements, or novel systems, with different species, interactions 
and functions (Hobbs, Higgs &amp;amp; Harris, 2009) 

Box 1.1 “Novel ecosystems” instead 



 

21 

Monitoring and evaluation  

Feedback from results of management actions is needed in order to modify, or even abandon, 

ineffective strategies, to allow other managers/stakeholders to learn from experience and even to 

validate the management programme. These issues can only be achieved through monitoring and 

evaluation of the actions taking place; without them the programme is not complete. Evaluation of 

actions should include information about the population of the target invader(s), the condition of the 

area under management, and changes in species composition. Establishment of specific targets at 

the beginning of the management programme will help to more-accurately evaluate its success or 

failure afterwards (Wittenberg &amp;amp; Cock, 2001).  

Public Awareness and Education  

Public awareness and education are often considered as an important part of prevention but they 

should also be seen as essential to other management options (Wittenberg &amp;amp; Cock, 2001). Activities 

should target technicians, stakeholders and the public in general who are important vectors of 

introduction and spread of invasive species (Ruiz &amp;amp; Carlton, 2003). A well informed public will adopt 

a more responsible attitude (e.g. selecting native or non-problematic exotic species; being aware of 

introduction pathways and excluding them; adopting measures to avoid being an “accidental vector“ 

of seeds) and become active (e.g. contributing to early detection programmes; controlling species in 

private lands) with significant repercussions for species management. Awareness activities should 

deal with issues such as environmental and economic risks involved with IAS, laws and regulations 

to prevent introductions of alien species (e.g. reasons for the restrictions; regulatory actions), species 

recognition and easy, practical things to do in order to collaborate with IAS management. Printed 

materials, video presentations, talks, workshops, interactive games and hands on activities are all 

promising approaches (Wittenberg &amp;amp; Cock, 2001; Marchante et al., 2010).  

 

Biological control: the most sustainable option? 

Biological control (= biocontrol) consists in the use of a species (host-specific) to control another 

species that has become problematic; the first species is considered to be a natural enemy of the 

second. According to Pyšek and Richardson (2010) biocontrol “has become and will remain the 

foundation of sustainable control efforts for many invasive species, especially plants, in many 

regions”. Several other authors recognized it as the most “environmentally friendly” and cost effective 

management practice (Holden, Fowler &amp;amp; Schroeder, 1992; Murphy &amp;amp; Evans, 2009; Wilson et al., 



 

22 

submitted). Biological control includes several different techniques with classical biological control 

(CBC) being the most commonly used against invasive species. CBC is based on the Enemy 

Release Hypothesis (Keane &amp;amp; Crawley, 2002) (see above) and when applied to plants searches for 

host-specific herbivores or pathogens in their native range and afterwards introduces them into the 

new exotic location, where the plant has become problematic (Harley &amp;amp; Forno, 1992). The aim is to 

control exotic invasive species in an attempt to “rebalance nature”, i.e., remove the competitive 

advantage that the species had acquired when it was initially transferred, and becoming equivalent 

to the native species which has their own natural enemies. The aim of CBC is not to eradicate the 

invasive species but instead to reduce it to levels where it no longer causes a significant problem 

(Hulme, 2006) though supporting survival of the agent itself and allowing self-replicating populations 

to persist without the need for additional efforts of reintroductions.  

Biological control has been used for over a century worldwide, with the first international transfers in 

the 1870s. Initially it was mostly used against plants and insects that caused problems to agriculture 

crops, but more recently it has begun to be used also against invasive species, mainly plants and 

arthropods (Murphy &amp;amp; Evans, 2009). Nevertheless, the extended use against invasive species was 

not adopted in Europe (Sheppard, Shaw &amp;amp; Sforza, 2006) until early 2010, when the first official 

release occurred in the UK (Djeddour &amp;amp; Shaw, 2010). Worldwide, nearly 400 agents have been 

released against over 130 plant species in 70 countries (Julien &amp;amp; Griffiths, 1998). Many introductions 

of biocontrol agents resulted in either complete or moderate levels of success. Complete biocontrol 

has been roughly estimated for ca. 30-39% of total cases of invasive plants, while estimations are 

that a higher number of agents have contributed significantly to control de target (Murphy &amp;amp; Evans, 

2009). The earliest successful examples included control of the New World prickly pears (Opuntia 

spp.) in Australia, in the 1920s, using the moth Cactoblastis cactorum. Nevertheless, failures either 

due to failing to achieve successful control or due to non-target effects are also common. The 

records of biocontrol agents who have become problematic through direct, and less frequently 

indirect, non-target effects (Louda et al., 2003; Louda &amp;amp; Stiling, 2004; Messing &amp;amp; Wright, 2006) came 

mainly from the first half of 20th century, when tests performed pre-release were less rigorous and 

risks were not considered in the same way as presently. The problematic cases pushed biological 

control to become a highly specialized science, whose protocols address maximizing both safety and 

success and thereby minimizing ecological risks (Murphy &amp;amp; Evans, 2009). The practice of selecting 

efficacious agents has progressed but is not yet “satisfactory”. Assessing ecological risks prior to 

release is also not entirely possible (particularly regarding indirect effects) but host specificity 

screening can accurately determine the feeding characteristics of agents. Presently most host 



 

23 

specificity testing is based on a centrifugal phylogenetic method (Briese, 2002). Unfortunately, too 

much attention has been paid to the few cases where there have been non-target effects (mostly 

from agents that had proved to be non-specific during risk assessment) and not enough on the many 

successful cases (mostly ignored because the target pests are no longer a problem) and this lead to 

public, even within scientific fora, apprehension about CBC of invasive species (Murphy &amp;amp; Evans, 

2009). Despite CBC can be considered as potentially dangerous, current practice assures that 

before a species is cleared for release a full range of tests are performed in order to assure that the 

risk is minimal. In fact, CBC is seen by many as the only safe, practical and economically feasible 

method to control invasive species that is sustainable in the long term (Murphy &amp;amp; Evans, 2009). 

THE STUDY ORGANISM: ACACIA LONGIFOLIA  

The genus Acacia sensu lato (Leguminosae, Mimosoideae) is one of the largest plant genus 

comprising over 1380 species, mainly native to Australia and Pacific (993 species), Americas (185 

species) and Africa (144 species) (Maslin, 2001) (Figure 1.6). Beyond their native range, acacias 

have been extensively introduced all around the world and large stands are nowadays very frequent, 

both under cultivation and as invasives. Being so numerous and widely used and problematic as 

invaders, publications about the genus are plentiful (e.g. Jones, Roux &amp;amp; Warren (1963); Milton &amp;amp; Moll 

(1982); Holmes &amp;amp; Cowling (1997); French &amp;amp; Major (2001); Hoffmann et al. (2002); Walters &amp;amp; Milton 

(2003); Impson, Moran &amp;amp; Hoffman (2004); Yelenik, Stock &amp;amp; Richardson (2004); Forrester, Bauhus &amp;amp; 

Cowie (2005); Hagos &amp;amp; Smit (2005); Rodríguez-Echeverría, Crisóstomo &amp;amp; Freitas (2007); Wood &amp;amp; 

Morris (2007); Marchante et al. (2009); Hellmann et al. (2010); Smith (2010)). Particular interest in 

the Australian acacias prompted an international workshop, “Human mediated introductions of 

Australian Acacia species: a global experiment in biogeography” whose results will be published in a 

special issue of the journal Diversity and Distributions in 2011. 

Acacia sensu lato is now known to be a polyphyletic group (Murphy, 2008) (subgenus Acacia is not 

closely related to subgenera Phyllodineae and Aculeiferum) and as such the maintenance of the 

genus Acacia as it was formerly known has been subject to much recent discussion and may be split 

in the future.

In fact, in the XVII International Botanical Congress (IBC) in Vienna (2005) the retypification was 

ratified with the acceptance of a new type for Acacia, namely A. penninervis as a replacement of the 

African/Asian species, A. nilotica. Implications are that when, and if, the genus Acacia sensu lato is 

divided the name Acacia will apply only to the ca. 1000 species, mostly Australian, now belonging to 

the subgenus Phyllodineae. If so, most of the species from other subgenera will become known as 

either Vachellia or Senegalia (Table 1.4). Nevertheless, the changes (including both retypification 

and alternatives to new names) are contentious both amongst the international botanical community 

(Moore et al., 2010) and the general public (Carruthers &amp;amp; Robin, 2010) and there are chances that 

the IBC 2005 decision may be reversed (Maslin, 2008).

Acacia longifolia (Andrews) Willd. (Sydney golden wattle, also named long-leafed wattle) belongs to 

the (former) Subgenus Phyllodineae. It is a small nitrogen-fixing tree or shrub (Rodríguez-

Echeverría, Crisóstomo &amp;amp; Freitas, 2007), 1.5–10 m tall, native to south-eastern Australia (Paiva, 

1999), which is invasive in Portugal, particularly in dune ecosystems (Marchante, 2001; Marchante, 

Marchante &amp;amp; Freitas, 2003), and South Africa (Dennill et al., 1999), among other regions (Elorza, 

Sánchez &amp;amp; Vesperinas, 2004; Kutiel, Cohen &amp;amp; Shoshany, 2004). It has linear to elliptic phyllodes, 5–

25 cm long x 10–35 mm wide, with 2–4 prominent primary veins; the inflorescences form spikes, 

solitary or twinned, 2–5 cm long (Figure 1.7); the pods are cylindrical or subcylindrical, 5–15 cm long 

x 4–10 mm wide and can be straight to curved; seeds are elliptic, sometimes irregularly shaped, 4–6 

mm long, shiny; funicle folded several times into a thickened lateral skirt-like aril (Maslin, 2001).

pods that can be straight to curved, d. seed with funicle folded several times. 

Some authors (Whibley, 1980) recognise two subspecies within this taxon (Table 1.5): A. longifolia 

(Andrews) Willd. subsp. longifolia and A. longifolia subsp. sophorae (Labill.) Court., while others treat 

A. longifolia and A. sophorae as distinct species (Paiva, 1999).

Both taxa show some morphological differences that in some situations seem to be ecological 

adaptations to the different environments where they occur (A. longifolia subsp. sophorae usually 

grows closer to ocean and subsp. longifolia is typically more inland), which seems to be the case in 

Portugal (H. Marchante, unpublished data). Acacia floribunda (Vent.) Willd is also closely related to 

A. longifolia and has earlier been considered as another subspecies (Maslin, 2001). 

 

WHY DUNE ECOSYSTEMS? 

Coastal dune ecosystems are considered a vulnerable ecosystem by IUCN and should have the 

highest priority for conservation action, namely when significant biodiversity values are at risk (Shine 

et al., 2000). They are not only fundamental barriers against the advance of the ocean but also 

harbour many plant species exclusive to dune systems, several of them endemic, and form unique 

habitats which confer them high ecological value (Carter, 1995; Honrado et al., 2006). The stability 

and natural dynamics of coastal dunes relies on natural plant communities which bind the labile 

sands and minimize the effects of erosion (van der Putten &amp;amp; Peters, 1995).  

Coastal ecosystems are considered amongst the ecosystems most seriously threatened by IAS, 

including in the Mediterranean (Chytrý et al., 2009; Pyšek &amp;amp; Richardson, 2010). In many regions of 

the world, e.g., Australia (Mason, French &amp;amp; Russell, 2007), California (Beckstead &amp;amp; Parker, 2003), 

NW European countries (Kollmann et al., 2007), Korea (Kim, 2005), Israel (Kutiel, Cohen &amp;amp; 

Shoshany, 2004), Portugal (Alves et al., 1998; Marchante, Marchante &amp;amp; Freitas, 2003; Rodríguez-

Echeverría, Crisóstomo &amp;amp; Freitas, 2007; Marchante et al., 2008b, a) and Spain (Sobrino et al., 

2002), studies with different perspectives show that invasive plant species modify, or have the 

potential to affect, coastal ecosystems in many different ways, including degradation of biodiversity. 

Moreover, the invaders frequently belong to life forms previously underrepresented in several 

habitats of dune ecosystems, thereby causing major transformations of the vegetation structure 

(Mack, 2003; Marchante, Marchante &amp;amp; Freitas, 2003) and even loss of habitat diversity. 

Native coastal sand dunes in Portugal are characterized by communities that extend from the ocean 

to the interior ordered into a spatial succession of plant associations (each with its own species 

assemblage), that typically replace themselves after disturbance, and conceal remarkable floristic 

and phytocoenotic diversity (Neto, 1993; Honrado et al., 2006; Silva, 2006). The dune species are 

naturally adapted to nutrient poor sands, drought, plenty of light at soil level (Smith &amp;amp; Huston, 1989) 

and, depending on the distance to the ocean, sand shifting and salinity. Natural coastal dune 



 

27 

ecosystems of northern Portugal are generally composed, from the ocean to inland (Figure 1.8) of: 

(1) a first zone of bare sand, known as the embryonic dunes, occasionally washed by the sea during 

storms and with sporadic small plants; (2) a second zone with shifting sands, composed of elevated 

dunes, normally parallel to the shoreline, where perennial herbaceous species dominate, known as 

the primary dune or foredune; (3) a more depressed zone known as interdune, where sands are 

stabilized and dominated by shrub and sub-shrubs species comprising a few small trees occurring 

infrequently; in the interdunal areas commonly occur sandy depressions with freshwater wetland 

communities; (4) another elevation (secondary dune) also dominated by herbaceous species. The 

number of interdune (depressions) /secondary dune (elevations) sequences that occur in the interior 

dunes may be variable and depends, e.g., on the extension of the dune system, wind regimes, 

topography and occurrence of obstacles to movement of sands (Alves et al., 1998). Beyond the 

interior dunes, there is frequently another zone with sands already consolidated allowing, together 

with dune species, the occurrence of other species such as Pinus spp. and Juniperus spp. There is 

frequent overlap and local variation in the zones which frequently makes them difficult to distinguish 

in the field.  

Figure 1. 8 Representation of the typical dune system of the coastal ecosystems of northern Portugal with 
some of the characteristic plant species. All the species represented occur in the study system (São Jacinto 
Dunes Nature Reserve, see below).  

Along the Portuguese coast, pristine dune systems with all the zones populated by their respective 

typical plant communities are becoming increasingly rare due to several factors, namely forestry 

plantations, exploitation for agriculture, tourism, sand extraction, construction and invasion by alien 



 

28 

species (Rei, 1924; Alves et al., 1998; Marchante, Marchante &amp;amp; Freitas, 2003; Silva, 2006; 

Marchante et al., 2008b). This last threat, in particular, is explored in the present study. Numerous 

native species in dune ecosystems are being replaced by invasive species which include A. longifolia 

(Alves et al., 1998; Marchante, Marchante &amp;amp; Freitas, 2003), Acacia saligna (Labill.) H.L. Wendl. 

(Marchante, 2001), Carpobrotus edulis (Campelo, 2000) and Cortaderia selloana (Marchante, 

Freitas &amp;amp; Marchante, 2008). 

Acacia longifolia, the most prominent and widespread invader in Portuguese dunes, was introduced 

over 150 years ago to curb sand erosion. Besides deliberate planting, its abundance and distribution 

has increased greatly following fire events (Marchante, Marchante &amp;amp; Freitas, 2003). One of the 

Portuguese coastal dune ecosystems where A. longifolia has become more widespread and 

problematic includes São Jacinto Dunes Nature Reserve, with high value for conservation (Decreto 

Regulamentar nº 24/04, de 12 de Julho). 

 

São Jacinto Dunes Nature Reserve  

São Jacinto Dunes Nature Reserve (SJDNR) is located at the central-northern coast of Portugal (40º 

39’ N, 8º 44’ W). It was created in 1979 (Decreto-Lei nº 41/79, de 6 de Março) and reclassified in 

1997 (Decreto Regulamentar nº 46/97, de 17 de Novembro). Later in 1999 it was proclaimed the 

Special Protection Area (SPA) “Ria de Aveiro” to conserve wild bird species (Decreto-Lei nº 384-

B/99, de 23 de Setembro), which integrated Natura 2000 Network, and included SJDNR. Finally in 

2004 (Decreto Regulamentar nº 24/04, de 12 de Julho) SJDNR was reclassified again maintaining 

the protection status and extending the limits of the reserve from 660 ha to 960 ha.  

The climate of SJDNR is Mediterranean with an Atlantic influence. Dominant winds blow from 

Northwest (NW) and North (N), approaching from the Ocean (additional climatic details are given in 

chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5). The soils are arenosols according to FAO classification (Rogado et al., 

1993).  

Perennial plant communities observed in SJDNR include two communities on mobile dunes (one on 

embryonic and other on primary dunes) and several communities on interior dunes (interdune and 

secondary dunes), including chamaephytic communities of perennial acidophilous grasslands and 

dwarf shrublands that coexist in a mosaic (Table 1.6) (Silva, 2006).  

Several endemic species, including Portuguese, Iberian and European endemism, are present (e.g. 

Antirrhinum majus L. subsp. cirrhigerum (Ficalho) Franco, Corema album (L.) D. Don, Iberis 



 

29 

procumbens Lange subsp. procumbens, Juniperus phoenicea L. subsp. phoenicea, Stauracanthus 

genistoides (Brot.) Samp., Tuberaria guttata (L.) Fourr., Ulex europaeus L. subsp. latebracteatus 

(Mariz) Rothm. and Vulpia alopecuros (Schousboe) Dumort.) (Figure 1.8) which shows the 

importance of the communities present in SJDNR. Several zones characteristic of a pristine dune 

system, with their typical communities, are still present in some areas of the SJDNR although their 

conservation status is highly variable and hardly ever incorporating the complete sequence (from 

embryonic to interior dunes “in a row”) in pristine condition. Nowadays they are very frequently 

overwhelmed by exotic invasive species (Figure 1.9).

communities and the most representative species occurring in SJDNR (base on Alves et al. (1998); Honrado 
et al. (2006) and Silva (2006).

Late in the 19th century, early in the 20th century along the Portuguese northern coast, including in 

SJDNR, efforts aimed at dune stabilization were very frequent and consisted of installation of 

palisades (at least in some of the locations), followed by plantation of Pinus pinaster Aiton and 

Myrica faya Aiton and afterwards sowing of several exotic species, namely Acacia (mainly 



 

30 

A. longifolia but also other species that did not become so widespread), and Carpobrotus edulis 

(Neto, 1993); subsequently, existing shrub species (Cytisus spp., Ulex spp., ) were promoted in 

several locations of the coast aiming to increase cover of the bare sands (Rei, 1924). In SJDNR, 

A. longifolia proliferated after the initial introduction, and several fire events over time triggered its 

exponential growth, resulting in the large monospecific stands that are currently common. 

  

  

  

Figure 1. 9 Contrast between the native dune communities (images on the left) vs. the invaded areas (images 
on the right) in SJDNR. 

When this work was carried out, A. longifolia constituted a near-monoculture over 150 ha of SJDNR 

and occurred at lower densities in association with other species over 200 ha (Guimarães, 2004), 

extending from the foredune to the zone of consolidated sands.

THESIS OUTLINE AND OBJECTIVES 

This work, through its five main chapters, aims to contribute to fill some gaps in invasion Ecology, 

and additionally to contribute with practical management options that will be useful to managers. 

The first aim of this thesis – chapter 2 - was to evaluate the effect of the invasive Acacia longifolia at 

vegetation level, in areas with different invasion durations (stands long-invaded for more than 20 

years, vs. stands recently invaded occupied after a summer fire in 1995) over a five years period. 

This allowed, simultaneously and in addition, addressing two issues seldom studied: quantification of 

impacts in the long-term and effects of duration of invasion. 

The anticipated key role of the invader seeds in perpetuating the invasion leaded to the second aim - 

chapter 3: to increase knowledge about the seed ecology of A. longifolia, namely quantifying the 

seed rain, assessing seed viability before and after entering the soil and measuring the accumulated 

soil seed bank. 

Ideally, before embarking in expensive management plans of an invasive plant the likelihood that 

restoration efforts will succeed should be assessed (Zavaleta, Hobbs &amp;amp; Mooney, 2001). Therefore, 

the next question that this thesis intended to answer was whether the system still was resilient, i.e., 

capable of autogenic recover after clearing. With this aim, two distinct approaches were considered:  

- first (chapter 4), the soil seed bank was evaluated to test the potential resilience of the system and 

to access the validity of seedling emergency method to do it quickly; cleared vs. uncleared plots 

were compared;  

- second (chapter 5), in experimentally cleared plots (considering A. longifolia removal with and 

without the underlying litter layer) the recovery of vegetation was monitored through time, from 2002 

to 2008 achieving a recovery period longer than most post-clearing studies.  

Both approaches (chapters 4 and 5) considered clearing of long- and recently invaded stands.  

Because the methodologies available in Portugal for control of A. longifolia are expensive and do not 

produce satisfactory long-term results, a biocontrol agent successfully used in South Africa for more 

than 20 years was evaluated. The safety of using the Australian gall forming wasp (Trichilogaster 

acaciaelongifoliae), that targets seed reduction but also curbs the vegetative growth, was tested to 



 

32 

reduce the invasive success of A. longifolia in Portugal (chapter 6); its implications are discussed 

and an overlook of the legal procedures needed before release is presented. 

General introduction (chapter 1) and discussion (chapter 7) are included aiming to integrate the five 

main chapters (chapters 2-6) and trying to avoid much overlapping with each separate chapter.

 Long term changes in vegetation structure of a

ABSTRACT 

Invasive alien species are one of the main threats to biodiversity worldwide, being considered a 

major threat to endangered species as well as to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems. Despite 

studies about impacts of invasive species are becoming very frequent, there is a scarcity of both long 

term studies and studies considering the effects of invasion time on native communities. 

Diversity, species richness and cover of contrasting plant communities of a Mediterranean coastal 

dune were compared over a five-year period to assess the impacts of an invasive tree, Acacia 

longifolia. Three situations were compared, a recently invaded area, a long-invaded area and an 

area that had never been invaded. Plant traits, similarity between areas and species turnover were 

also analyzed because these measures potentially reveal patterns that are not apparent in 

comparisons of the single values derived from measures abovementioned. 

Results showed that native species richness was lower in both recently and long-invaded areas than 

in uninvaded areas. As invasion time extended, species shared with native areas decreased, 

reductions in plant cover, evenness and diversity intensified and species turnover rates declined. 

Analyses of traits showed that: a) in both recently- and long-invaded areas geophytes, 

hemicryptophytes and chamaephytes were underrepresented while species of therophytes adapted 

to elevated nitrogen levels in the soil were overrepresented; b) in recently invaded areas, species 

typical of dunes were replaced by native and exotic generalists; c) in long-invaded areas terophytes 

and wind-dispersed species were underrepresented. The potential for reinvasion by A. longifolia was 

higher in long-invaded areas, while other exotic species were more frequent in recently invaded 

areas. 

Synthesis. Dunes invaded by A. longifolia become transformed from almost treeless landscapes 

into highly modified woodlands which become more degraded the longer the invasion is left to 

progress. The invasion brings about a diversity of biotic changes in both the structure and function of 

the ecosystem which are yearly dynamic and apparently tend to stabilize after several decades. 

Analyses including only single-figures parameters conceal some of the changes taking place.

INTRODUCTION 

Invasive alien species (IAS) represent one of the main threats to biodiversity worldwide, being 

considered a major threat to rare and endangered species as well as to the integrity and function of 

ecosystems (Blossey, 1999; Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005; Richardson et al., 2008; 

Gaertner et al., 2009). The impacts of IAS are numerous, severe and frequently irreversible, often 

intensifying with time (van Wilgen et al., 2008; Lodge et al., 2009). They affect biodiversity, decrease 

species richness and change community structure, species cover and environmental conditions 

(Gaertner et al., 2009; Hejda, Pyšek &amp;amp; Jarosík, 2009; Jäger, Kowarik &amp;amp; Tye, 2009; Vilá et al., 2010) 

while altering ecosystem functioning and disrupting ecological networks (Vitousek &amp;amp; Walker, 1989; 

D'Antonio &amp;amp; Kark, 2002; Ehrenfeld, 2004; Marchante et al., 2008b; Heleno et al., 2009; Bartomeus, 

Vilà &amp;amp; Steffan, 2010). Economic impacts, e.g. management actions and productivity losses (Lodge et 

al., 2009), can be enormous and are usually more easily perceived by stakeholders. In Europe 

alone, costs have been estimated as ca. €10 billion annually; a conservative value as impacts of 

more than 90% of the IAS have not yet been quantified (Hulme et al., 2009). Invasive plants are 

frequently spatially more localized than animals and have more ecological than economic impacts, 

making it difficult to attribute a financial value to their impacts (Vilá et al., 2010). Regardless of their 

obvious impacts, sweeping generalizations such as IAS cause species extinction or that they rank 

2nd as the most significant worldwide threat to biodiversity, should be avoided or at least rigorously 

contextualized when used (Sax &amp;amp; Gaines, 2008; Jäger, Kowarik &amp;amp; Tye, 2009). 

Impacts of IAS are frequently assessed according to their influence on parameters such as species 

richness, diversity indexes or plant cover (Hejda &amp;amp; Pyšek, 2006; Hejda, Pyšek &amp;amp; Jarosík, 2009; 

Jäger, Kowarik &amp;amp; Tye, 2009) which, while useful, reduce changes in species assemblages to single 

values which over simplify the situation and thereby may obscure real patterns and trends. Species 

traits are characteristics that reveal species adaptations to the environment they occupy (Menezes, 

Baird &amp;amp; Soares, 2010) allowing complex clusters of species to be categorised into a relatively small 

number of groups. Both biological (e.g. life form, dispersal mode) and ecological (e.g. tolerance to 

nitrogen level, species biogeographic distribution) traits can be useful indicators of environmental 

change, e.g. invasion by exotic species, because they have the potential to reveal differences 

amongst species assemblages of distinct communities or alterations occurring in one community 

through time. This is possible because each species (with its own identity, adaptations and functions) 

is assigned a trait. Analyses of these species traits can augment patterns derived from single-value 

parameters, with no need for complex analyses of extensive species lists. 



 

46 

Coastal ecosystems are considered of high priority for conservation action by the International Union 

for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) (Shine, Williams &amp;amp; Gündling, 2000), being important ecological 

systems of native plants which retain the integrity of the coast line by promoting dune formation 

(Carter, 1995). Alien plant species have been frequently introduced to coastal dunes to curb sand 

erosion (Rei, 1924; Elorza, Sánchez &amp;amp; Vesperinas, 2004; Hulme et al., 2008). With time, however, 

some of these same species have become a major threat to the ecosystems they were supposed to 

protect and dunes now rank among the most extensively transformed ecosystems due to invasive 

species (Beckstead &amp;amp; Parker, 2003; Marchante, Marchante &amp;amp; Freitas, 2003; Mason, French &amp;amp; 

Russell, 2007; Marchante et al., 2008b). When coupled with increasing threats, such as sea levels 

rising, valuable dune ecosystems will probably become even more vulnerable to disruptive 

influences (Granek et al., 2010).  

Plant communities on Portuguese coastal dunes include a remarkable floristic and phytoceonotic 

diversity (Honrado et al., 2006). Although the floristic assemblage does not include a high number of 

endemic species, several habitats (namely plant associations of the interior dunes) are considered 

unique (Honrado et al., 2006; Silva, 2006) and a high priority for conservation. The invasion of these 

usually-open communities by IAS, including tree species, leads to drastic changes in the landscape 

(Alves et al., 1998; Campelo, 2000; Marchante, Marchante &amp;amp; Freitas, 2003). Acacia longifolia 

(Andrews) Willd (Fabaceae) is one species which is invasive in several regions of the world 

(Henderson, 1998; Weber, 2003), including in Europe where it has proliferated on coastal dunes 

(Elorza, Sánchez &amp;amp; Vesperinas, 2004). Its impacts include declines in plant species richness and 

cover, changes in seasonal dynamic of plant communities (Marchante, 2001; Marchante, Marchante 

&amp;amp; Freitas, 2003; Hellmann et al., 2010) and alteration of soil chemical and microbiological 

parameters with consequent changes to ecosystem functioning (Marchante, 2008; Marchante et al., 

2008b, a). 

Considering the impacts measured so far, A. longifolia is a “transformer” (sensu Richardson et al 

(2000) or “ecosystem engineer” (see Conser &amp;amp; Connor (2009)). However, as for many other species 

and ecosystems, though important, median or long-term analyses of the transformation of plant 

communities through time are scarce and none seem to consider the influence of invasion duration 

(Strayer et al., 2006; Carlsson et al., 2010; Hellmann et al., 2010). Considering that the dune 

systems which are particularly susceptible to invasion (Marchante, Marchante &amp;amp; Freitas, 2003) 

include many plant species with ephemeral life cycles (Silva, 2006) some of which persist as 

dormant seed banks (Marchante, Freitas &amp;amp; Hoffmann, 2010a) studying such systems for long time 

periods can reveal patterns that are easily overlooked when assessments are of short duration. This 



 

47 

realisation provided the impetus for us to set up permanent plots in sand dunes that were either non-

invaded, recently invaded and long-invaded by A. longifolia. The plots were monitored for 5 years 

aiming to assess the impact of A. longifolia on the composition of native plant communities and to 

measure species, traits and habitat changes over time. The reinvasion potential of A. longifolia and 

invasion by other exotic species were also analysed. We investigated the following questions: 1) Do 

impacts of invasion intensify as the invasion gets protracted? 2) Are patterns of impacts dynamic 

over a period of five years? 3) Can measurements of multiple parameters reveal impacts not noticed 

when single-value parameters are measured alone? This study also serves as a baseline 

assessment to compare what happens to the invaded plant communities after A. longifolia is 

removed with mechanical clearing, and after the introduction of biocontrol agents, thereby avoiding a 

general deficiency in this type of study as recognised by Thomas &amp;amp; Reid (2007). 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Study site - The study area was located in the São Jacinto Dunes Nature Reserve (hereafter 

SJDNR) which is located on the central-northern coast of Portugal (40º 39’ N, 8º 44’ W). This area 

has been a proclaimed nature reserve since 1979, receiving the status of Special Area of 

Conservation for the Natura 2000 network in 1999. When this study was initiated, SJDNR covered 

ca. 660 ha being enlarged subsequently. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the West and by the 

Ria de Aveiro estuary to the East. The climate is Mediterranean with Atlantic influence. The mean 

annual precipitation is 920 mm and mean monthly temperatures range from 10.2ºC in January to 

20.2ºC in June. Dominant winds blow from Northwest and North, approaching from the Ocean. 

Historically the area supported open vegetation characterized by several plant communities 

composed of distinct assemblages of species (plant associations), with sporadic small trees and 

abundant shrubs, sub-shrubs and herbs (Neto, 1993). Such open communities still persist in non-

invaded areas, including several endemic plant associations (Honrado et al., 2006; Silva, 2006). 

Pinus pinaster Aiton (maritime pine) and A. longifolia were introduced into SJDNR early in the 20th 

century to curb movement of sand. Acacia longifolia has subsequently proliferated, occurring as a 

monoculture in over 150 ha and at lower levels in association with other plant species in over 200 ha 

(Guimarães, 2004). Besides A. longifolia, the reserve is also invaded to a lesser extent by 

Carpobrotus edulis (L.) N.E.Br. (ice plant) and Cortaderia selloana (Schultes) Asch. &amp;amp; Graebner 

(pampas grass). 



 

48 

The areas invaded by A. longifolia in SJDNR can be divided into long-invaded and recently invaded 

areas. Long-invaded areas (while limited to monospecific stands) have had A. longifolia for several 

decades and are largely restricted to a small area located along the Southern border of SJDNR. The 

recently invaded areas came about during the 1995 summer when A. longifolia proliferated over a 

large area of the reserve after a natural fire which destroyed about 200 ha of vegetation, including 

pine plantations and dune vegetation (Silva 1997). Before the fire, the burnt areas had low numbers 

of A. longifolia plants, mostly in the understory of maritime pines. 

Experimental design - Studies were carried out to compare non-invaded, recently invaded and 

long-invaded areas, all located on stabilized dunes away from the sea. Non-invaded areas were free 

of A. longifolia trees, while invaded areas supported almost monospecific, arboreal stands of 

A. longifolia overlaying large quantities of leaf litter (Marchante et al., 2008b) and reducing the 

intensity of light at soil level (Table 2.1). Open patches within the invaded areas contained remnants 

of the native vegetation, with several species in common with the non-invaded areas, indicating that 

the invaded areas had the same floral elements prior to the proliferation of A. longifolia.  

Table 2.1 Light intensity and quantity of litter (mean ± SE) in experimental plots of long-invaded, recently 
invaded and non-invaded areas. Light measurements were made monthly from February to October 2006 
between 9 a.m. and 12 a.m. on days without clouds. Values are means of six measurements per plot. Litter 
data are based on Marchante et al. (2008b). 

 

In each type of stand (non-invaded, recently invaded and long-invaded), five permanent plots, each 

10 x 10 m, were demarcated. Each plot was located at least 50 m from any of the others. In each 

plot, two transects of 2 x 10 m was marked giving a total of 10 transects in each type of area. 

Transects were monitored in May/early June 2003, 2006 and 2008, when most annual and biannual 

species were growing (Marchante, Marchante &amp;amp; Freitas, 2003). The number and identity of plant 

species, species cover, and number of A. longifolia seedlings was registered in each transect. 

Data analysis - Seedling abundance and cover of A. longifolia, species richness, total plant cover, 

Pielou evenness and Shannon diversity (all parameters translated as single figures) were calculated 

as the means of ten 20 m2 transects and were analysed by a General Linear Model (GLM) repeated-

measures MANOVA, with year of monitoring (2003, 2006 and 2008) as a within subject factor and 

invasion status as between-groups factor. As absence of A. longifolia was a prerequisite to define 

non-invaded areas, analyses of A. longifolia cover and seedling abundance did not include non-

invaded areas. Data from the three sampling years were compared to detect possible changes in

impacts through time. Post-hoc tests were conducted using the Fisher LSD, at P &amp;lt;0.05. Because 

the interaction between factors was significant (except for Evenness) the post-hoc was performed for 

the interaction and the graphs were computed accordingly. Since A. longifolia was the potential 

driver of change in the rest of the plant community, it was excluded from the analysis of species 

richness and total plant cover. Pielou evenness and Shannon diversity calculations (Magurran, 1988) 

included A. longifolia as these indexes reflect the presence of a dominant species. STATISTICA 6.0 

(StatSoft, Inc., 2001, http://www.statsoft.com) was used for the statistical analysis. 

For plant traits, dominance-diversity curves, also named rank abundance curves, were computed 

according to Kent and Coker (1992), to describe evenness of species distribution and relative 

species dominance within each type of area. Curves were first computed for the full rank of species 

(each sampling year separately) to compare the three areas. The species were then categorized into 

traits (Table 2.2) and additional curves were plotted for each plant trait separately. For traits analysis 

the coverage of each species in the ten 20 m2 transects were pooled to reveal the full spectrum of 

species in each area and then the mean of three years was computed. The species were ranked 

from the most to the least abundant for each curve separately.

Sorensen’s Similarity Coefficient (QS) was used to compare plant species composition in the three 

situations. QS detects differences between areas that have similar values of species richness, 

diversity or cover but are composed of different species assemblages. QS was computed with the 

formula QS = 2C/(A + B), where A and B are the number of species in samples A and B, 

respectively, and C is the number of species shared by the two samples. The coefficient varies 

between 0 (different) and 1 (identical) (Magurran, 1988). The species present in the ten 20 m2 

transects were pooled, for each year separately, providing the total number of species present in the 

ten transects of each area.  

Species turnover rates (TR) were calculated according to Hilli, Kuitunen &amp;amp; Suhonen (2007) to 

measure changes of species between 2003 and 2008, as follows: TR =0.5 (L+G), where L is the 

number of species lost and G is the species gained during a defined period of time. TR is 0 (zero) 

when there is no change in species composition over the interval between samplings and has no 

maximum value when there is change. 

RESULTS 

Presence of A. longifolia  

There was a significant interaction between invasion status and year of monitoring (F2,10 = 4.19, 

P = 0.048) with A. longifolia cover being ca. 10% higher in long-invaded areas than in recently 

invaded areas (Figure 2.1a). When the number of A. longifolia seedlings was quantified, as a 

measure of the reinvasion potential, there was also a significant interaction between factors 

(F4,20 = 40.67, P &amp;lt;0.0001) showing a significant increase of emerged seedlings in long-invaded 

areas, both over time and compared to recently invaded areas. There was a different trend in 

recently invaded areas with seedlings decreasing from 2006 to 2008 (Figure 2.1b).

Impacts in species richness, plant cover and diversity 

Overall, 75 plant species were identified during the study, including 53 species in non-invaded plots, 

with less than half as many (25) in long-invaded plots and 35 species in recently invaded plots 

(Appendix 2.1). Not surprisingly, both of the invaded areas were dominated by a single species, 

A. longifolia, while other species that were present in the invaded areas showed only very sparse 

cover. From 2003 to 2008, species abundances remained consistent for the most part, the exception 

being a marked decline in the abundance of several species in recently invaded areas (Appendix 

2.2). Overall, species were more evenly distributed in non-invaded areas than in invaded areas, 

although two species, Cistus salvifolius L. and Cytisus grandiflorus (Brot.) DC., were more abundant 

in some non-invaded plots and three other species, Carex arenaria L., Artemisia campestre L. 

subsp. maritima Arcangeli and Helichrysum italicum (Roth) G. Don fil. subsp. picardi (Boiss. &amp;amp; 

Reuter) Franco were also well represented on other non-invaded plots. 

Interaction between invasion status and year of monitoring was statistically significant for both 

species richness (F4,20 = 5.448, P = 0.004) and plant cover (F4,20 = 15.95, P &amp;lt;0.0001). The average 

number of plant species per plot under A. longifolia canopies was less than half the number of 

species in non-invaded areas and it was generally similar in both invaded areas (Figure 2.2a). Plant 

cover, other than A. longifolia (Figure 2.2b), was 3 to 6-fold lower in recently- and long-invaded 

areas, respectively, than in non-invaded areas. Plant cover increased between 2003 and 2006 in 

non-invaded areas and showed some decline between 2006 and 2008 in recently invaded areas with 

no significant variation otherwise.

Figure 2.2 Species richness (a) and plant cover (b) (mean +SE, n = 10), in 20 m2 plots, in areas long-invaded, 
recently invaded and non-invaded by A. longifolia, from 2003 to 2008. Values do not include A. longifolia. Bars 
with the same letters are not significantly different (LSD, p &amp;lt;0.05). 

There was a significant interaction between invasion status and year of monitoring for plant diversity 

(Shannon F4,20 = 4.71, P = 0.008) but not for evenness (Pielou F 4,20 = 0.41, P = 0.798). Both factors 

independently had a significant effect on evenness (Invasion status F 2,10 = 183.55, P &amp;lt;0.0001; year 



 

52 

of monitoring F 2,10 = 18.68, P &amp;lt;0.0001). Both diversity measures were, at least, twice as high in 

non-invaded areas than in invaded areas; and higher in recently invaded areas than in long-invaded 

ones (Table 2.3). From 2003 to 2008, Shannon Diversity decreased in both invaded areas, while 

evenness decreased in recently invaded and non-invaded areas.

Impacts on biological and ecological plant traits 

Non-invaded areas had almost exclusively native species while several exotic species were present 

in invaded areas (Figure 2.3). More species that are characteristic of dunes and dune/generalists 

were present, and particularly abundant, in non-invaded areas, while these species comprised only 

about a third of all species in invaded areas. The number of native generalist species was higher in 

recently invaded areas, with two species co-dominating and many sparse species co-occurring. 

  

Figure 2.3 Dominance-diversity curves for each attribute of species biogeographic distribution in communities 
of areas non-invaded, recently invaded and long-invaded by A. longifolia. The sequence in each trait attribute 
(in abscissa) lists species from most to least abundant and consequently each number in the different 
sequences does not necessarily correspond to the same species. Abundance of each species plotted is an 
average of observations between 2003 and 2008.  



 

53 

Regarding life forms (Figure 2.4), nanophanerophytes were the most abundant in non-invaded 

areas, despite there being only five species, followed by chamaephytes (with more species evenly 

distributed) and geophytes (with one species particularly abundant). Invaded-areas were dominated 

by the (micro) phanerophyte A. longifolia, and the few species, very sparse, that were found under 

A. longifolia were mainly therophytes. Three life forms, namely chamaephytes, geophytes and 

hemicryptophytes, that were well-represented in native dunes were scarce, or even absent, in 

invaded areas. Phanerophytes, other than A. longifolia, that were present in invaded areas were in 

very low abundance.

invaded, recently invaded and long-invaded by A. longifolia (see Figure 2.3 caption for details). 

There was a high number of wind-dispersed species in recently invaded and non-invaded areas 

(Figure 2.5), with them being more evenly distributed in the latter areas. These species were 

apparently more sensitive to invasion age as about half were not found in long-invaded areas. Many 

animal dispersed species and species with no obvious agent of dispersal were excluded by 

A. longifolia, with invaded areas having less than half the numbers found in non-invaded areas.

invaded, recently invaded and long-invaded by A. longifolia (see Figure 2.3 caption for details). 



 

54 

There were more species that are dependent on nitrogen in recently invaded areas than on native 

dunes, with escionitrophilous being more numerous and abundant in both invaded areas 

(Figure 2.6). Non-nitrophilous species were most numerous and abundant in non-invaded dunes.

non-invaded, recently invaded and long-invaded by A. longifolia (see Figure 2.3 caption for details).  

Similarity amongst areas 

There was little similarity in species composition of invaded and non-invaded areas, decreasing with 

invasion duration. About 20% (QS 2003 = 0.18; QS 2006 = 0.23; QS 2008 = 0.19) of the species were 

common to long- and non-invaded areas while ca. 30% species (QS 2003 = 0.35; QS 2006 = 0.31) were 

shared between recently- and non-invaded areas, with the exception of 2008 (QS 2008 = 0.14). More 

than 50% of the species were common to both of the invaded areas (QS 2003 = 0.51; QS 2006 = 0.56; 

QS 2008 = 0.56). 

Species turnover rates 

Turnover rates (TR) were higher than zero in all areas showing that a shift of species has occurred 

over time, being significantly higher in some of the areas (F2,27 = 3.51, P = 0.044). TR was higher in 

non-invaded areas (TR = 2.98 ± 0.66) and recently invaded areas (TR = 2.86 ± 0.39), which were 

similar to each other (P = 0.86), and higher than in long-invaded areas (TR Long-

invaded = 1.46 ± 0.16; P = 0.025 and P = 0.037, when compared to non-invaded areas and recently 

invaded areas, respectively).

DISCUSSION 

Previous short-term studies of the impacts of moderate invasions of A. longifolia in Portuguese 

dunes showed seasonal reductions in species richness which were particularly striking in spring 

when ephemeral life forms were most abundant, and a consistent decrease in native plant cover and 

diversity (Marchante, Marchante &amp;amp; Freitas, 2003). The present long-term study corroborates some of 

the earlier findings, but in areas more-densely invaded by A. longifolia. More importantly, the current 

study showed that impacts both intensify and change patterns as the time of invasion extended. 

Furthermore, it showed that some changes take years to become evident and that assessment of 

impacts including only parameters expressed by single-figures can give an incomplete picture of the 

changes that are occurring. 

How do impacts of invasion on plant communities intensify with time? 

Plant communities in areas recently invaded by A. longifolia were already substantially different from 

those in non-invaded areas showing that vegetation responds more rapidly to invasion than soil 

whose chemical and microbial composition was particularly altered in long-invaded stands but much 

less so in recently invaded areas (Marchante et al., 2008b, a). Changes in plant communities were 

even more pronounced under long-invaded stands where the denser canopy prevents further the 

light penetration (Table 2.1) and increasingly reduces bare soil for other species to grow in. The 

thicker layer of litter accumulated on the soil surface (Facelli &amp;amp; Pickett, 1991; Marchante et al., 

2008b) and the depleted abundance of viable native seeds in long-invaded soils (Marchante, Freitas 

&amp;amp; Hoffmann, 2010a) also contributed to intensification of these changes. The cumulative degradation 

of plant communities with time was corroborated by the fact that there were fewer shared species 

between non-invaded and long-invaded areas (ca. 20%), compared with ca. 30% shared between 

recently invaded and non-invaded areas.  

Several vegetation traits also changed with invasion time. For example, generalist species were 

more abundant in recently invaded areas than in long-invaded areas. The fire in the SJDNR in 1995 

created gaps which suited generalist species, both native (e.g. Crepis capillaris (L.) Wallr., Sonchus 

spp., Cardamine hirsute L.) and exotic (Gamochaeta pensylvanica (Willd.) Cabrera and Conyza 

spp.), and the invader itself. These species are frequently associated with habitat disturbance and 

are uncommon or even absent in native dune communities (Alves et al. 1998; Franco, 1984). They 

are thus irrelevant (sometimes even with negative consequences) for the conservation of the system. 

Therophytes and wind dispersed species were less abundant in long-invaded areas. This pattern 

seems to be associated with: (i) the dense canopy creating a barrier to inflows of seed; and (ii) 



 

56 

attrition of seed viability in the deep litter layers over long periods of isolation, affecting especially 

species that depend solely on seeds to reproduce, such as therophytes. 

This demonstration that the impacts escalate and change with duration of invasion is important in 

that it contributes to a better understanding the invasion process (Strayer et al., 2006) and, 

additionally, it emphasises that there are very real consequences of delaying the start of 

management operations against invasive plants. 

What do median/long-term studies reveal about impacts of invasive plants? 

Sampling repeatedly over several years enables to recognise which impacts are transient and which 

are permanent. In this case, germination of A. longifolia seeds within the thickets and replacement of 

species, changed over time with the changes being distinct in the different areas; short-term studies 

would have lost these trends. Despite the rapid proliferation of A. longifolia (from 0% to over 60% 

cover in less than ten years after the fire), during the five years of this study densities of thickets 

were apparently stable. Recruitment of A. longifolia into the populations was counter-balanced by the 

collapse of some mature trees (possible associated with ageing as it was more frequent in long-

invaded areas) that created gaps which were quickly colonized by invasive and generalist species. 

Germination of A. longifolia seeds is typically stimulated by fire (Pieterse &amp;amp; Cairns, 1986) but it is 

also coupled with disturbance (Marchante, Freitas &amp;amp; Hoffmann, 2010b) as happens in many other 

species (Grubb, 1988; Bullock, 2000). This study showed that there is a greater threat of reinvasion 

in long-invaded areas, even though A. longifolia germination was lower in the gaps created by falling 

trees than in adjacent cleared areas (see chapter 5).  

In long-invaded areas, parameters such as species richness, cover, evenness and diversity did not 

change much during the five years of the study. In recently invaded areas, these parameters 

decreased, with their values approaching those of long-invaded areas by the end of the study. This 

pattern indicates that impacts tend to stabilize over time, as corroborated by TR being lower in areas 

that were long-invaded, crossing a threshold at some stage as the invasion progresses.  

Do single-measure parameters conceal information about impacts of invasive 

species? 

Comparisons of species richness indicated that ca. 30% and 40% of the species in long and recently 

-invaded areas, respectively, persisted through the invasion. Sorensen index showed that only ca. 

20% (in long-invaded) and ca. 30% (in recently invaded areas) of the species were shared with non-

invaded areas, increasing the number of species that had been excluded and demonstrating that 



 

57 

novel species had entered the invaded system. In this case at least, the single measure for species 

richness had not revealed the full extent of the impact of the invasion. 

Although average species richness per sample plot was similar in long- and recently invaded areas, 

the total number of species was higher in recently invaded areas. This discrepancy can be attributed 

to the 1995 fire when propagules of different generalists arrived in the burnt area and emerged 

heterogeneously through the area. Species rank abundances revealed that the higher number of 

species in recently invaded stands comprised numerous species with particularly low abundances 

which are more likely to become locally extinct, thereby reducing species richness in these areas in a 

short-term, as was already evident in 2008.  

Plant trait analyses showed other patterns in the impact of invasion not noticeable with single 

measures. The few species growing under A. longifolia were mostly distinct from those on non-

invaded dunes. Chamaephytes, geophytes and hemicryptophytes were almost absent in the 

understory of invaded stands, as well as in the seed bank (chapter 4; Marchante, Freitas &amp;amp; 

Hoffmann, 2010a), reflecting the substantial threat posed by A. longifolia to many species that 

belong to these life forms and which are characteristic of dunes (e.g. Malcolmia littorea (L.) R. Br., 

Medicago marina L., Crucianella maritima L., Herniaria ciliolata Melderis subsp. robusta Chaudhri 

and Iberis procumbens Lange subsp. procumbens, the last two endemic) and are highly relevant for 

conservation of dune communities (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2001). The 

presence of the above-mentioned species in non-invaded areas shows that, like other invasive 

species (Jäger, Kowarik &amp;amp; Tye, 2009), A. longifolia is unlikely to cause extinction at a landscape 

level. There is however cause for concern because some endemic species have been eliminated 

within invaded areas.  

Species adapted to soils with high levels of nitrogen and/or disturbance, including exotics (e.g., 

G. pensylvanica, Oxalis pes-caprae L., Conyza spp.) and natives (e.g. Sonchus asper (L.) Hill, 

Fumaria muralis Koch subsp. muralis, Lactuca virosa L.) were more frequent and/or abundant in 

invaded areas than non-nitrofilous species that are characteristic of dunes and thrive in non-invaded 

communities (e.g., Artemisia campestre L. subsp. maritima, C. maritima, M. littorea). These findings 

confirm that invasive species not only alter the environment through their physical presence, 

decreasing light and space, but induce indirect impacts through altered soil chemistry and microbial 

changes (Ehrenfeld, 2003; Marchante et al., 2008a, b). The increase in soil nitrogen and other 

nutrients in SJDNR (Marchante et al., 2008b) may thus be compounding problems for native dune 

species (Smith &amp;amp; Huston, 1989), and at the same time facilitating A. longifolia and other exotics 



 

58 

which in turn may exclude additional dune species (Warren, Topping &amp;amp; James, 2009; E. Marchante, 

unpublished data). 

Further consequences of the impacts promoted by A. longifolia invasion 

Pristine coastal sand dunes in Portugal are characterized by communities that extend from the 

ocean to the interior ordered into a spatial succession of plant associations (each with its own 

species assemblage) with remarkable floristic and phytocoenotic diversity (Honrado et al., 2006; 

Silva, 2006). These species are naturally adapted to nutrient poor sands and plenty of light at soil 

level (Smith &amp;amp; Huston, 1989). Before invasion by A. longifolia communities with small growth habits 

and a few tree species sporadically present were frequent in SJDNR (Neto, 1993). Most of these 

protected native communities, particularly those from interior dunes, are being increasingly replaced 

by arboreal stands dominated by A. longifolia, with increasing environmental degradation (Bartz, 

Heink &amp;amp; Kowarik, 2010) and changes of ecosystem functions (Marquard et al., 2009) as litter 

accumulates and changes soil carbon and nutrient levels (Marchante et al., 2008b) and shade 

predominates at soil level (Table 2.1). Even so, some of the species surviving under A. longifolia are 

characteristic of native communities indicating that the invaded areas were once similar to non-

invaded areas and still have some potential to be restored (see chapter 5). As with invasion by other 

Acacia species (Smith, 2010), a drastic transformation of community structure is occurring rendering 

an unrecognizable landscape, notably in its physiognomy and vertical stratification with loss of 

several strata. Because many native species do not cope with the abovementioned abiotic changes 

(Smith &amp;amp; Huston, 1989), biotic transformations are also evident, namely replacement of species and 

alteration of the plant traits as registered (at least partially) in other invaded systems (Holmes &amp;amp; 

Cowling, 1997; Jäger, Kowarik &amp;amp; Tye, 2009). As observed by Holmes (1990), animal dispersed 

species and species without obvious agents of dispersal (some probably also animal dispersed 

(Fenner &amp;amp; Thompson, 2005)), are commonly excluded by invading Acacia species, indicating that 

the animal seed dispersers themselves are also being excluded. This supports findings of 

Carvalheiro et al. (2010) who showed that alterations to plant communities have even more severe 

knock-on effects for higher trophic levels (e.g. herbivores, parasitoids and dispersers interlinked in 

ecological webs). These types of changes are almost-certainly occurring in the invaded dunes of 

Portugal but have not yet been investigated. Besides these trophic effects, changes in plant 

communities due to invasion by A. longifolia have repercussions for ecosystem services such as 

supporting (e.g. alteration of succession patterns and soil and nutrient cycling (Marchante et al., 

2008b)), provisioning (e.g. threats to native species, alteration of genetic resources), regulating (e.g. 



 

59 

changing pollination services and erosion and fire regimes) or even cultural services (e.g. effects on 

ecotourism, changes in perception of landscape) (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005; Vilá et 

al., 2010). Although not quantified yet, these repercussions clearly translate into high market-related 

costs which need to be assessed. 

 This five-year study showed that invasion by A. longifolia in coastal dunes brings about a diversity of 

biotic changes in structure (decrease of species richness, cover and diversity) and function 

(alteration of dispersal dynamics, spectra of Raunkiær life forms and nitrogen adaptations, out-

competed dune species) of the ecosystem. Some of the changes occur in short periods being lost in 

“snap shot” studies. Additionally, this study showed that impacts at plant communities aggravate, 

reinvasion potential increases and similarity to non-invaded communities’ decreases as the invasion 

extends, apparently tending to stabilization after several decades. Trait attributes/species 

represented under A. longifolia stands change along time but that perception can be lost with 

analyses including only single-figures parameters.  

Parallel experiments including removal of the invader and the litter beneath it will help to evaluate the 

recovery potential of these invaded communities (see chapter 5). In the future, economic impacts 

need to be assessed to show stakeholders and policy-makers the value of what is being lost.

Seed ecology of an invasive alien species, Acacia longifolia 

(Fabaceae), in Portuguese dune ecosystems

ABSTRACT 

Premise of the study Worldwide, invasive plants threaten biodiversity, by disrupting habitats and 

ecosystem processes, and cause major economic losses. Invasiveness in plants is frequently 

associated with prolific production of seeds which accumulate in the soil. Knowledge of the extent 

and persistence of invasive seed banks helps explain invasion processes and enables management 

planning. A study of Acacia longifolia, an invasive species in Portuguese dune ecosystems, provides 

an informative example. 

Methods Seed rain and dispersal (seed traps), the persistence of seeds in the soil (burial) and the 

extent of seed banks were measured and analysed.  

Key results Seed rain is concentrated under the canopy with ca. 12 000 seeds.m-2 falling annually. 

The number of seeds in the soil declined with time, with only 30% surviving after 75 mo. Losses were 

lowest at greater depths. Seeds germinability was low (&lt;12%) but viability was high (&gt;85%) for 

surviving seeds. The seed bank under the canopy was approximately 1500 and 500 seeds.m-2 in 

long- and recently invaded stands, respectively. Some seeds were found up to 7 m from the edge of 

stands, indicating that outside agencies facilitate dispersal. 

Conclusions Acacia longifolia produces large numbers of seeds some of which are lost through 

germination, decay and granivory. The remainder form vast and persistent seed banks which serve 

as a source of replenishment and make it difficult to control the invader once it is established. Control 

costs escalate as the duration of an invasion increases, highlighting the urgency of initiating and 

persevering with control efforts.

INTRODUCTION 

Invasive plant species constitute a major threat to biodiversity worldwide (Richardson et al., 2008; 

Gaertner et al., 2009), disrupting the integrity and function of ecosystems (Blossey, 1999) with dire 

consequences for rare and endangered species. Their impacts on human health (Genton et al., 

2005) and economies, through management practices and losses in productivity (Lodge et al., 2009), 

are numerous and severe and usually escalate and intensify with time (Lodge et al., 2009). Very 

often, invasiveness in plants is associated with prolific production of seeds which accumulate in the 



 

69 

soil and form extensive seed banks (Milton and Hall, 1981; Pieterse and Cairns, 1988; Richardson 

and Kluge, 2008). Successful control of alien species ultimately requires a reduction in the extent of 

these seed banks (Pieterse and Cairns, 1988; Richardson and Kluge, 2008) and the effectiveness of 

control programmes can be significantly compromised through massive seed germination in cleared 

areas (Campbell, 2000). Knowledge of the extent and persistence of seed banks is needed in order 

to understand the invasion process of each invasive species and to implement rational management 

programmes for their control. 

To be successful, seeds have to be in the correct physiological state to germinate at a time and 

place that will allow the new plant to survive to maturity (Murdoch and Ellis, 2000). Seeds of some 

species germinate immediately after ripening, as long as water is available, while others become 

dormant or quiescent and remain viable for extended periods until conditions are suitable for 

germination (Fenner and Thompson, 2005), allowing discontinuous germination in some species 

(Murdoch and Ellis, 2000). There is evidence that seed longevity may vary under different 

environmental conditions, especially soil type and climate (Hill and Kloet, 2005) and that duration of 

time in the soil can extend, diminish or have no effect on the viability of seeds (Araújo and Cardoso, 

2007). 

Germinability of seeds may vary among species, among populations and even among individuals as 

a consequence of genetic, phenotypic and environmental conditions under which the seeds mature 

(Gutterman, 2000). These conditions may include the position of the seed on the parent plant, the 

age of the plant, the size of the seeds, the abiotic conditions (e.g., temperature, light, moisture, soil 

nutrients) where the plant develops and the position where the seeds fall (under or outside the 

canopy) (Gutterman, 2000). Germination, i.e. emergence from the seed bank, is a response to 

environmental stimuli (Fenner and Thompson, 2005). Particularly in hard-coated seeds, the absence 

of germination is generally due to physical dormancy which in many species is broken by diurnal 

temperature fluctuations or temperature extremes induced by fire (Baskin and Baskin, 1998). 

As in other legumes, most Acacia species have hard-coated seeds (Cavanagh, 1980) with physical 

dormancy which facilitates the formation of persistent seed banks. Not surprisingly therefore, several 

Acacia species from Australia (Holmes and Cowling, 1997; Dennill et al., 1999; Kutiel et al., 2004a), 

and some from Africa (Kriticos et al., 2003; NLWRA, 2008), have become notorious invasive plants 

in different regions of the world. One of these, Acacia longifolia (Andrews) Willd. (‘Sydney golden 

wattle’, also named ‘long-leaved wattle’), has proliferated in the dune systems of the coast of 

Portugal and is now considered a priority problem there (Ministério do Ambiente, 1999; Marchante et 

al., 2003; Marchante, 2008). Acacia longifolia is a polycarpic species, annually producing seeds 



 

70 

throughout its life (Fenner and Thompson, 2005). The seeds are elliptic, 4–6 x 2-2.5 mm in size, 

shiny (Maslin, 2001), weight 20-30 mg (Murray et al., 1978); they have a small elaiosome that 

attracts ants, which bury and disperse the seeds over modest distances, creating a short “ seed 

shadow” (Willson and Traveset, 2000). Despite this zoochorous adaptation in seeds of several 

Acacia species, the vast majority of seeds accumulate beneath, or very close to, the canopies of the 

parent plants (Milton and Hall, 1981; Walters and Milton, 2003). Seed banks of A. longifolia have 

been described as prolific and persistent in South Africa (Milton and Hall, 1981; Pieterse and Cairns, 

1988). Environmental stimulation, namely fire, is generally required to break dormancy in Acacia 

species (Pieterse and Cairns, 1986) although the activities of microorganism (Trumble, 1937) and 

insects (Holmes and Rebelo, 1988) may also play a role. 

Coastal dune ecosystems are considered a vulnerable ecosystem by International Union for 

Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and should have the highest priority for conservation action, namely 

when significant biodiversity values are at risk (Shine et al., 2000). In many regions of the world, e.g., 

Australia (Mason et al., 2007), California (Beckstead and Parker, 2003), Denmark and other NW 

European countries (Kollmann et al., 2007), Korea (Kim, 2005), Israel (Kutiel et al., 2004b), Portugal 

(Alves et al., 1998; Rodríguez-Echeverría et al., 2007; Marchante et al., 2008), Spain (Sobrino et al., 

2002), studies with different perspectives show that invasive plant species modify, or have the 

potential to affect (Kollmann et al., 2007), coastal ecosystems in many different ways, including 

degradation of biodiversity. Moreover, the invaders frequently belong to life forms previously 

underrepresented in several habitats of dune ecosystems, thereby causing major transformations of 

the vegetation structure (Mack, 2003; Marchante et al., 2003) and even loss of habitat diversity. 

Although A. longifolia is an aggressive invader in several ecosystems, including dunes, around the 

globe (Henderson, 1995; Weber, 2003; Elorza et al., 2004; Marchante et al., 2008), studies of its 

seed bank and the potential threat it constitutes for dune ecosystems after removal of the invader are 

scarce. Particularly in Portugal, there have been no studies on the seed banks of invasive species 

and on their role in the invasion process in dune (or other) ecosystems. In order to redress this 

deficiency and to compare the situation in Portugal with other parts of the world, and thereby assist 

in the management of A. longifolia, we measured: 1) the seed rain and dispersal from the plants; 2) 

the survival and viability of seeds after entering the seed bank; and 3) the extent of the resultant 

accumulated soil seed bank. Understanding the longevity of seeds allows estimations to be made of 

the short- and long-term probability of reinvasion in areas that have been cleared of invasive 

species, while knowledge of patterns of seed rain can provide valuable information about dispersal 

capacity and determine the extent to which non-invaded areas are at risk (Cottrell, 2004).

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Study site - Experiments were conducted in São Jacinto Dunes Nature Reserve, a coastal sand 

dune ecosystem of approx. 660 ha, at the central-northern coast of Portugal (40º 39’ N, 8º 44’ W). 

The climate is Mediterranean with Atlantic influence, with a mean annual precipitation of 920 mm and 

mean monthly temperatures ranging from 10.2ºC in January to 20.2ºC in June; mean maximum 

temperatures are 24.2ºC in August and mean minimum temperatures are 6.0ºC in January (Weather 

Station no.102, Aveiro University 40º 38’ N, 8º 40’ W, period 1981-2002). Dominant winds blow from 

Northwest (NW) and North (N), approaching from the Ocean. The soils are arenosols according to 

FAO classification (Rogado et al., 1993). Historically the area supported open vegetation 

characterized by sporadic small trees and more abundant shrubs, sub-shrubs and herbs. Early in the 

20th century A. longifolia was deliberately introduced to curb sand erosion and over time it 

proliferated and spread from areas where it was first introduced with the increases in density and 

extent occurring in pulses triggered by fire events (Silva and Lopez, 1997). When the experiments 

were carried out, A. longifolia constituted a near-monoculture in over 150 ha and occurred at lower 

densities in association with other species in over 200 ha (Guimarães, 2004). 

The existing stands can be divided into long-invaded areas, where the plant has been established for 

several decades, and recently invaded areas, where the plant has proliferated within the past 15 yr. 

The long-invaded areas (limited to stands with monocultures of A. longifolia ) are restricted to a small 

portion of the reserve located along the south border where the sands are stable (Figure 3.1). In 

long-invaded areas dense thickets persist for more than 20 yr. Acacia longifolia proliferated in the 

recently invaded areas after a natural fire in the 1995 summer which affected about 200 ha of the 

reserve, including pine plantations and dune vegetation (Silva, 1997). Before the fire, burnt areas 

had sporadic A. longifolia plants in low densities, frequently in the understory of Pinus pinaster Aiton. 

Since the fire, A. longifolia has invaded large areas that extend from the primary dune to the 

stabilized dunes (Marchante, 2001) (Figure 3.1). When the experiments were undertaken, 

A. longifolia was the dominant species in both the long-invaded and recently invaded areas selected, 

forming continuous closed stands (frequently with a cover about 70%) with native plant species 

occurring infrequently in the understory (Marchante et al., 2004).

Figure 3.1 Location of the study area, São Jacinto Dunes Nature Reserve, in central-northern Portugal, 
showing areas where experiments of dispersal and soil seed bank took place. Numbers indicate places where 
transects were demarcated, in recently invaded areas (1, leeward transects and 2, windward transects) and 
long-invaded areas (3, windward transects and 4, leeward transects). Arrows indicate the orientation of 
transects in each area. B, area burnt in 2005, and largely invaded after that (recently invaded areas). 

 

Experiment 1. Seed production and dispersal - Other studies, and personal observations, 

showed that Acacia seeds/ seedlings are frequently detected in close proximity to the stands of 

parent plants so the experimental design was set up accordingly. To determine the possible 

influence of wind on dispersal, two sets of trap transects were set out so that each was aligned with 

direction of the prevailing winds and at a right angle to the edge of a recently invaded stand of 

A. longifolia. Six of the transects were placed on the leeward side of the thicket, which happened to 

be on the stabilized dune, and six were placed on the windward side of the thicket, which happened 

to be on the primary dune (Figure 3.1 – no. 1 and 2, respectively). In the primary dune A. longifolia 

plants were small (about 1.5 m tall) and prostrate due to exposure to strong winds and salt spray 

from the sea. The plants were much taller (more than 5 m) on the stabilized dunes. Another set of six 

transects was established in the stabilized dunes at right angles to the edges of a long-invaded 

thicket to compare seed fall there with that in the recently invaded area (Figure 3.1 – no. 1 and 4, 

respectively). The long-invaded and recently invaded stands of A. longifolia were about 2.5 km apart. 

Seed traps were set out at the end of May 2004, before seeds started to fall, to quantify seed rain 

and evaluate dispersal mediated by wind and/or gravity. As the source was a continuous stand, a 

regular distribution of traps was used (Bullock et al., 2006). The traps were placed at intervals along 

permanent transects, 12 lying outside the stand (points designated “+”) and 5 inside the stands 

(designated “–“) with the point under the tip of the extreme pod-bearing branch set as point zero 

(Figure 3.2a). From -2 m to +2 m, seed traps were spaced 0.5 m apart; from +2 m to +10 m and from 

-2 m to -3 m the traps were a meter apart. Seed traps (Figure 3.2b) were made from the top portion 

of laterally bisected 5 l plastic bottles that were inverted to make a funnel with a 0.0154 m2 opening. 



 

73 

A fibreglass bag was tied around the neck of the funnel to form a closed container in which the falling 

seeds were trapped. Each funnel was positioned in the field by being attached, with flexible wires, to 

a 10 cm high PVC pipe which was partially sunk into the sand, after Cottrell (2004). 

 

Figure 3.2 Experimental set up of experiment 1. (A) Schematic representation of transects established to 
measure seed rain and dispersal, with 10 m lying outside the stand (0 to +10 m) and 3 m inside the stand (0 
to -3 m); the point at the extremity of pod-bearing branches was set as point zero; 1 m intervals were used, 
but from – 2 m to + 2 m additional traps were placed at 0.5 m (o). (B) The seed trap, designed to catch 
A. longifolia seeds. Traps were partially sunk into the sand to avoid drift into the trap of seeds lying on the 
surface; fibreglass allowed free drainage. 

Seeds were collected from the traps at fortnightly intervals after seed rain commenced in June 2004 

and continued until seed fall stopped (end of August 2004). The seeds were counted, and then 

checked for germinability and viability (see methods below). 

Experiment 2. Survival of seeds in soil seed bank – Using a protocol adapted from Holmes 

and Moll (1990), ripe seeds were collected during July 2002 from dehiscent pods of A. longifolia 

trees for burial at different depths within cylinders made of fibre glass. The cylinders were filled with 

soil from the study site which had been freshly sieved (2 X 2 mm) to remove any extraneous seeds 

of A. longifolia. While being filled, each cylinder had one hundred seeds of A. longifolia sown at one 

of three depths, 1-2 cm, 4-5 cm or 8-9 cm from the surface. Once filled with soil, a plastic net lid (2 x 

3 mm) was attached to seal the open end of the cylinder. To protect the cylinders from disturbance 

by burrowing animals, each was enclosed in a plastic net sleeve (10 cm deep x 7.5 cm diameter) 

which was sealed at both ends. The mesh of the net (2 x 3 mm) was large enough to allow seedlings 

to emerge. Each cylinder was labelled with a plastic tag indicating the position of the seeds within. 

The cylinders were buried with their tops leveled with the soil surface.  

The cylinders were placed in position, after the peak of seed fall, in open spaces among the native 

dune vegetation, where there were no A. longifolia trees, in order to avoid additional deposition of 

seeds in the top of the cylinders. A completely randomised block design was used to position groups 

of cylinders in five different locations each marked with a wooden stake in the NE-corner. A map of 



 

74 

the positions of the cylinders was drawn to facilitate recollection. In all, 96 cylinders were buried (6 

collecting dates x 5 replicates x 3 depths + 6 controls with no seeds, to confirm that seeds were not 

entering the cylinders after placement). 

Cylinders were collected after 4, 10, 18, 31, 55 and 75 mo. Any seedlings observed emerging from 

the bags at collecting times were recorded and removed. On each collection date, 15 bags with 

seeds, as well as one of the control bags, were lifted and transferred to the laboratory where the 

contents were sorted with a sieve to obtain the remaining seeds which were counted. Surviving 

seeds were tested for germinability and viability (see methods below). 

In order to analyze the data, seeds in each sample were considered as 1) emergent (germinated in 

the field); 2) germinable (germinated in the laboratory without stimuli); 3) dormant (germinated after 

stimulation); 4) non-viable (rotted or did not germinate for other reasons); or 5) missing. Seeds 

defined as “recovered” included viable and non-viable with seeds defined as “viable” including 

germinable and dormant. 

Experiment 3. Dimension of soil seed bank -- Areas adjacent to the dispersal experiment (1) 

were selected and monitored. The long-invaded areas were located on stabilized dunes while the 

recently invaded areas included both primary dune (along the windward edge of the thicket) and 

stabilized dune (along the leeward edge) (Figure 3.1). 

Transects were laid at a right angle to the edge of thickets on both the windward and leeward sides. 

The transects (n = 4 for each situation) were 10 m long (Figure 3.3). The point under the tip of the 

most extreme pod-bearing branch was set as point zero so that 7 m of transect extended away from 

the stand (points designated “+”) and 3 m extended into the stand (designated “-“).  

Figure 3.3 Experimental set up of experiment 3. (A) Schematic representation of transects established to 
measure the seed bank, with 7 m lying outside the stand (0 to +7 m) and 3 m inside the stand (0 to -3 m); the 
point at the extremity of pod-bearing branches was set as point zero. (B) Coring device used to extract soil 
samples; four samples were collected in each point. 



 

75 

Before seed rain commenced (7 to 14 April 2004) soil samples were collected along the transects to 

quantify the accumulated seed bank of A. longifolia. At meter intervals, four soil cores (7.5 cm 

diameter X 10 cm deep; area 44 cm2) were collected and sieved (2 mm mesh) to extract and count 

A. longifolia seeds. All of the seeds were retained and screened for germinability and viability (see 

methods below). 

Germinability and viability determination - To test germinability seeds were placed in 90 mm 

sterilized, glass Petri dishes containing filter paper moistened with benomyl solution (0.022% active 

ingredient benlat), to avoid fungal development, and retained in a controlled environment at 

25 (± 2)ºC. Germinated seeds (those with at least 2 mm radicle) and rotten seeds were counted 

every two days and removed. After 30 days the remaining seeds were considered to be dormant and 

were cut at the micropylar end and maintained until all seeds had germinated or rotted to determine 

total viability. Seeds that germinated after cutting were considered dormant and were added to the 

seeds that germinated before cutting to derive the total number of viable seeds. 

Statistical analyses – The counts of seeds resulting from the seed rain (experiment 1), and 

accumulated in the seed bank (experiment 3), were converted into number of seeds.m-2 before 

analysis. Seed rain (experiment 1) was first compared between recently invaded transects running in 

opposite directions (one factor), with distance to the stand margin (another factor), using a General 

Linear Model (GLM), with a between-subject design Factorial ANOVA. The samples from the 

leeward transects were compared with another Factorial ANOVA, considering stand age and 

distance to the stand margin as factors. The quantity of seeds accumulated in the soil seed bank 

(experiment 3) was compared with a Three-Way Factorial ANOVA with age of invasion, wind 

direction, and distance to the stand margin as factors. In experiment 1 and 3 (separately) all seeds 

originating from samples collected at each distance were pooled together in each group (long- and 

recently invaded; leeward and windward) and germinability and viability calculated and then 

compared with One-Way ANOVA.  

In the burial experiment (2), seeds recovered were compared with a GLM, with a between-subject 

design Factorial ANOVA (depth and duration of burial as factors). The values of germinable and 

viable seeds were then analysed as percentages of the recovered seeds using a Generalized Linear 

Model (GLZ), with the number of recovered seeds as an offset term in order to accommodate sample 

size. 

When the interactions between factors were significant, means of the interactions were plotted; when 

the interactions were not significant the means were plotted for each factor separately. 



 

76 

Data were transformed when necessary to meet the ANOVA assumptions: seeds in the seed bank, 

(experiment 3) were log transformed ( ( )2log +x ); and seeds dispersed (experiment 1) were square 

root transformed ( 5.0+x ). Mean differences were separated with Tukey test at 5% level of 

significance. The analyses were performed using STATISTICA 6.0 (StatSoft, Inc. 2001, 

www.statsoft.com). 

RESULTS 

Seed production and dispersal -- Collection of falling seeds showed that there was a significant 

interaction (F7, 80 = 5.06, P &amp;lt;0.001) between wind direction and distance to the stand margin. After 

being released from the pods, the majority of the seeds fell under the trees (-3 m to 0 m), reaching 

average values of ca. 12 000 seeds.m-2 in the leeward transects and less than 2000 seeds.m-2 in the 

windward transects (Figure 3.4). A few seeds fell beyond the margin of the stand, being dispersed up 

to 1 m in both leeward and windward transects. There was little difference in the quantity and pattern 

of seed rain along the leeward edge of long- and recently invaded thickets (F1, 100 = 3.13, P = 0.080) 

(Figure 3.5). Only a small proportion of the seeds fell beyond the immediate edge of the canopy, and 

no seeds were found more than 2 m from the canopy.

Figure 3.5 Comparison of A. longifolia seed rain and subsequent wind dispersal occurring along the leeward 
edge of long-invaded and recently invaded thickets. Bars (means +SE, n = 6) with the same letters are not 
significantly different (Tukey test P &amp;lt;0.05). 

Seed germinability immediately after ripening was about 30-40% (Figure 3.6a, c), indicating that 

approximately 60-70% of the A. longifolia seeds showed innate dormancy at the time of dispersal. 

Most of the seeds needed stimulation to induce germination. Seed viability was high (about 90%) 

regardless of the situation in which they fell (Figure 3.6b, d). Neither the age of the invasion nor the 

position of the trees relative to the wind influenced germinability (age, F1, 10 = 0.159, P = 0.698; 

position, F1, 10 = 0.182, P = 0.679) and viability of the seeds produced (age, F1, 10 = 1.305, P = 0.280; 

position, F1, 10 = 0.065, P = 0.804) (Figure 3.6).

Figure 3.6 Measurements of A. longifolia seeds that germinated without any stimulus (germinability) (a, c) 
and after being stimulated (viability) (b, d), after the seed rain from plants along the windward and leeward 
margins of the thickets (A, B) and along the leeward margin of long-invaded and recently invaded thickets (C, 
D). Values are expressed as a percentage of the number of seeds collected in the traps. Bars are 
means +SE. There was no significant difference between any of the treatments. 

Survival of seeds in soil seed bank - There was no significant interaction between duration and 

depth of burial (F10, 77 = 1.57, P = 0.132); both factors independently showed a significant effect 

(duration of burial, F5, 77 = 34.31, P &amp;lt;0.001; depth, F2, 77 = 12.53, P &amp;lt;0.001) on the amount of seeds 



 

78 

recovered after burial. The percentage of A. longifolia seeds recovered decreased with duration of 

burial (Figure 3.7a). The decline in the number of seeds recovered was significant after 18 mo and 

again after 55 mo of burial. After 75 mo of burial less than 30% of seeds were recovered. Seeds 

buried at 8-9 cm showed significantly lower losses than at more superficial depths (Figure 3.7b). In 

the field, seedlings were seldom seen and emergent seeds were only observed when collections 

were made at 4 mo, in very low numbers (at the most, 4 seedlings were observed per cylinder) and 

only from the 1-2 cm and 4-5 cm depths. No seeds were found in the control samples.

Figure 3.7 Percentage of seeds of A. longifolia recovered after burial (a) for different durations and (b) at 
different depths. Bars (means +SE, n = 5) with the same letters are not significantly different (Tukey test 
P &amp;lt;0.05). 

The germinability of the buried A. longifolia seeds was consistently low, rarely reaching 12% of the 

recovered seeds (Figure 3.8). Even so, time (GLZ: Wald stat. 4 = 154.03, P &amp;lt;0.001) (Figure 3.8a) and 

depth (GLZ: Wald stat. 2 = 14.76, P = 0.006) (Figure 3.8b) of burial was statistically significant. After 

10 mo of burial there was an increase in the seeds that germinated without any stimuli. The slightly 

higher germination apparent at 75 mo was distorted due to an unavoidably-small sample size, not 

being considerably different from the others.

Dimension of soil seed bank - In the counts of seeds in the soil, significant interactions were 

found between age of invasion and distance to the stand margin (F10, 264 = 3.06, P = 0.001), and 

between wind direction and distance to the stand margin (F10, 264 = 2.35, P = 0.011). There was a 

close to significant interaction between age of invasion and wind direction (F1, 264 = 3.83, P = 0.051). 

The accumulation of A. longifolia seeds in the soil was almost exclusively under the trees  (-3 m to  -

1 m), with significantly higher numbers in the long-invaded areas (F1, 264 = 16.41, P &amp;lt;0.001) 

(Figure 3.10). There were more seeds in the soil under trees on the windward side of the long-

invaded thickets than under the trees on the windward side of the recently invaded thickets.

Figure 3.10 Acacia longifolia accumulated seed banks considering stands of different ages (long-invaded &amp;amp; 
recently invaded), different wind directions (windward &amp;amp; leeward) and distance to the stands margin. Bars 
(means +SE, n = 8) with the same letters are not significantly different (Tukey test P &amp;lt;0.05). 

The extent of the seed bank under the trees (-3 m to -1 m) varied between ca. 1500 seeds.m-2 in 

long-invaded areas, to less than 500 seeds.m-2 in recently invaded. Outside the stands the seed 



 

80 

bank was substantially lower, rarely reaching 30 seeds.m-2. Seeds were recovered at a greater 

distance on the windward sides of the thickets (7 m and 3 m from the edges of the long-invaded 

areas and recently invaded areas, respectively) than on the leeward sides where seeds were found 

at 1 m from the edge of only the long-invaded areas. 

Germinability was significantly higher (about 65%), and dormancy rate consequently lower, in seeds 

from recently invaded soils than in seeds from long-invaded soils (F1, 5 = 299.56, P &amp;lt;0.001) 

(Figure 3.11a) rates of which were negligible. Total viability (Figure 3.11b) of A. longifolia seeds was 

significantly higher in seeds from recently invaded soils (F1, 5 = 7.38, P = 0.042), where it was close 

to 100%, compared to about 70% in seeds from long-invaded areas.

Figure 3.11 Measurement of A. longifolia seeds accumulated in the seed bank (a) that germinated without 
any stimulus (germinability) and (b) after being stimulated (viability), expressed as a percentage of total 
number of seeds collected in soil samples. Bars with the same letters are not significantly different. 

DISCUSSION 

The levels of seed production that were measured revealed that A. longifolia is highly prolific in this 

exotic location and that, despite major losses of seeds (both before and after entering the seed 

bank), the resulting seed banks are substantial. This accumulation of seeds create problems for 

management programmes because they germinate en masse following removal of the overstory and 

the cleared areas rapidly become replenished thereby increasing control costs and impeding the 

recovery of ecosystems towards a more natural state. 

Seed production and dispersal - Seeds of A. longifolia fell mainly under the canopy, with very 

few being detected beyond 1 m, regardless of transect direction, a pattern which is common for 

many species, including other Acacia (Walters and Milton, 2003), that are not typically wind 

dispersed (Bullock and Clarke, 2000). Gravity, and not the wind, seems to be the agent operating in 

the movement of the great majority of seeds, although some seeds were found in the soil up to 7 m 

beyond the edge of the windward side of the thickets. Seeds of A. longifolia are known to be 

dispersed by ants, which are attracted to the elaiosome (Willson and Traveset, 2000), and have 



 

81 

been observed carrying seeds in the Portuguese dunes. Other outlying seeds could be the result of 

periodic strong winds blowing in the opposite direction to the dominant winds (Bullock and Clarke, 

2000) or may have been moved by other animals, such as rodents (Holmes, 1990), whose activity 

was not incorporated into the sampling process (Cottrell, 2004), or birds. Acacia longifolia seedlings 

have been reported under nests of collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto) in the vicinities of SJDNR 

(R. Vaz, SJDNR, personal observation), supporting this last hypothesis. Occasional seeds have 

been moved considerable distances because isolated individuals of A. longifolia occur in locations 

considerably distant (i.e. 100s of meters) from the main thickets (H. Marchante, personal 

observation). 

Trees on the leeward side of the thickets (wind NW-SE), were located in a landward location, on 

stabilized dunes, protected from strong winds and salt spray. They were more upright and produced 

more seeds than windswept trees making this aspect the predominant direction of invasion. Trees in 

both long and recently invaded areas produced similar quantities of seeds indicating that, as in other 

species (Fenner and Thompson, 2005), the quantity of seeds produced is not significantly influenced 

by the age of the plant. Up to 16 000 (average 12 000) seeds.m-2 fall under the trees on the leeward 

side of the thicket in a single season. Studies with the same species in South Africa (Milton and Hall, 

1981) measured lower numbers of seeds (approximately 3000 seeds.m-2) but this discrepancy may 

have occurred because there are substantial annual fluctuations in levels of seed production 

(Shibata et al., 2002), or due to inadvertent seed loss from the traps. The lower number of seed in 

South Africa may also be due to the type of trap used, since seed predation and/or removal of seeds 

by wind are probably higher in mesh traps than in funnel traps used in our study (Kollmann and 

Goetze, 1998).  

Survival of seeds in soil seed bank – Our results show that once buried only 20-40% of 

A. longifolia seeds persisted in the seed bank after 31 mo, with little change after 75 mo. Studies with 

Acacia saligna and Acacia cyclops showed that, after 30 mo of burial at depths between 1 and 

10 cm, 49-79% of A. saligna seeds persisted in the seed bank while less than 5% of A. cyclops did 

so (Holmes and Moll, 1990). Acacia longifolia shows a pattern more similar to that of A. saligna. 

Holmes and Moll (1990) reported that survival declined more rapidly with deeper burial while we 

observed the opposite in accordance with other studies (Zorner et al., 1984; Lonsdale et al., 1988). If 

shallow seeds disappear more rapidly, it is expected that seeds will persist for longer in areas with 

deep sandy soils because more seeds will reach greater depths. These findings should be 

considered when planning management of such areas. 



 

82 

Several factors contribute to seed loss. Germination naturally contributes to seed bank declines even 

though Fenner and Thompson (2005) note that the majority of seeds fail to emerge as seedlings. In 

this study, the few A. longifolia seedlings that were detected emerging in the field were from seeds at 

depths above 4-5 cm. Other species have been shown to emerge from greater depths (Kent et al., 

2001), including A. saligna and A. cyclops whose seedlings reach the soil surface from depths of 

15 cm (Holmes and Moll, 1990). For both these species, seedling emergence in the field was 

generally much higher than for A. longifolia and germination continued for at least 30 mo after burial 

(Holmes and Moll, 1990). In the experiments reported here, some A. longifolia seedlings may have 

been overlooked, having appeared and died in the period between sample collections. Other studies 

with A. longifolia in the same dune system showed that numerous seeds germinate in the field (from 

unknown depths), mainly, as happens with many plant species (Grubb, 1988), after disturbance 

associated with the removal of the parent plants, with most dying soon after emergence (Marchante 

et al., 2004).  

As buried samples were not disturbed, and vestiges of seedlings were not detected on the soil 

surface, germination does not seem to be the main reason for disappearance of seeds. 

Unsuccessful germination at depths too deep to emerge has also been implicated as a major reason 

for seed losses from seed banks (Lunt, 1995). In this study, some signs of germination were 

apparent as vestiges of radicles or seed coats in the soil samples recovered but disintegration and 

fragmentation made it impossible to extrapolate the original numbers of intact seeds involved, a 

difficulty noted by other authors (Bekker et al., 1998). Nevertheless, mortality through unsuccessful 

germination at excess depths does not seem to be the main cause of seed loss, as most seeds 

disappeared at shallower depths. 

Decay through the action of microrganisms must also have played a prominent role in determining 

numbers of surviving seeds, as has been implicated with other Acacia species (Holmes, 1989) and 

legume species in general (Leishman et al., 2000). Death due to natural ageing does not seem a 

probable cause of decline because the seeds were buried for only 75 mo and Acacia species are 

known to have higher longevities in the soil (Cavanagh, 1980; Daws et al., 2007). 

Low germinability in batches of seeds stored in the soil has been shown for A. saligna and A. cyclops 

(Holmes and Moll, 1990). The higher germination rate of A. longifolia seeds collected after 10 mo of 

burial could be due to the seeds being collected in spring, when temperatures were increasing and 

there was still sufficient rainfall to keep conditions in the soil moist and therefore favourable for 

breaking dormancy. Dormancy of seeds is known to break during periods of increasing ambient 

temperatures (Holmes and Moll, 1990), especially, at least in legumes, if there is simultaneous 



 

83 

absorption of water through the hilum of the seeds (Degreef et al., 2002). Most of the other collection 

times fell in winter, when temperatures were lower and the seeds had not been stimulated to break 

dormancy before collection. 

The resulting soil seed bank – Acacia longifolia plants in long- and recently invaded areas 

produced similar amounts of seeds (average 12 000.m-2, under the canopy) each season but there 

were substantially lower numbers of seeds in the soil seed banks, with more in long-invaded areas 

than in recently invaded areas (approximately 1500.m-2 and 500.m-2, respectively). This differs from 

the situation in South Africa where there were more seeds in the seed bank (7646 seeds.m-2) than 

the numbers produced each season (ca. 3000 seeds.m-2) (Milton and Hall, 1981). A portion of the 

discrepancy that lead to the higher densities of A. longifolia seeds in South African soils is 

attributable to the value 7646 being an average of two means, 2110 seeds.m-2 and 13182 seeds.m-2, 

which were collected 6 mo after and immediately after seed rain, respectively (S. Milton, University of 

Stellenbosch, personal communication). The lower of these values is still higher than the values 

recorded during our study and suggests a substantial and steady loss of seeds in the months 

following seed rain, as our samples were collected just before seed rain commenced. Indeed, as 

seeds accumulate with time the seed bank would be expected to numerically exceed its source of 

replenishment, as happened in South Africa. The unexpected deficit in the seed bank in Portugal 

may be due to conditions in the dune ecosystem that favour the decay of seeds or climatic conditions 

that induced higher levels of germination.  

Events that happen before the seeds enter the seed bank (germination, dispersal, granivory) and 

within the soil seed bank (decay, ageing, germination, granivory) account for seed disappearing. The 

probability of some of these events happening within the seed bank in Portugal have been discussed 

above. Granivory, which has been shown to be a cause of seed loss elsewhere (Marone et al., 

2000), would not account for the loss of seeds in burial trials because the samples were protected 

with plastic net sleeves. However, granivory could explain a significant proportion of seeds that were 

lost, both before entering and within the seed bank. Granivores, namely rodents, have already been 

identified as a major consumer of seeds of A. cyclops, A. saligna (Holmes, 1990) and A. longifolia 

(Pieterse and Cairns, 1988) in South Africa even though granivory declines as dense thickets of the 

weed form and the canopy closes (Holmes, 1990). Fieldmice (Apodemus sylvaticus) were 

sporadically observed during trials (H. Marchante, personal observation) and are a potential seed 

predator of A. longifolia seeds. Other, as yet unidentified, invertebrates are known to feed on the 

seeds of A. longifolia (E. Marchante, University of Coimbra, unpublished data). 



 

84 

The more numerous soil seed bank under long-invaded stands can be explained by the greater 

number of seed rain events from trees that had been in the area for a longer period than the trees in 

the recently invaded area. Studies with A. saligna have similarly shown that in some areas seed 

density is much higher in long-invaded sites compared to recently invaded sites, though this is not 

always the case (Holmes, 2002).  

Seeds of A. longifolia fell, and subsequently accumulated, predominantly under the canopy of the 

parent trees. A few scattered seeds were additionally found in the soil beyond the margins of the 

thickets even though dispersal trials failed to detect seeds in the tail of the dispersal curve, as is 

often the case (Portnoy, 1993). In order to account for this, sampling could have been intensified with 

distance (Bullock et al., 2006). The outlying seeds could be the result of the action of several 

dispersal agents (see discussion above). 

Most of the seeds gathered during the different parts of this study did not germinate without a 

stimulus, displaying low levels of germinability, but had consistently high levels of viability (&gt; 85%), 

as previously recorded by Milton and Hall (1981). A large portion of fresh Acacia seeds are 

impermeable to water and are therefore unlikely to germinate soon after ripening (Rolston, 1978). 

Germinability levels of fresh seeds recorded in this study were higher (approximately 30%) than the 

2% recorded for fresh seeds of A. cyclops and for several other Acacia seeds extracted from soil, 

namely A. longifolia, where germinability never exceeded 9% (Milton and Hall, 1981). The age of the 

parent plant had no apparent effect on germinability of fresh seeds even though germinability is 

known to decline with age of the parent in some plant species (Gutterman, 2000). Seeds collected 

from long-invaded areas had much lower germinability (&amp;lt;0.05%) than seeds collected from recently 

invaded areas (&gt; 50%). This indicates that over time dormant seeds accumulate in the soil so that 

older seed banks have a greater proportion of seeds that are unable to germinate without being 

stimulated, i.e. usually through disturbance. While the seed banks of long-invaded areas contain 

higher numbers of seeds than more-recently invaded areas, they constitute a smaller threat of 

replenishing the original stands of the weed through germination if disturbance of the soil can be 

avoided during removal of the overstory. However, zero disturbance is almost impossible to achieve 

given the nature of control operations and the fact that removal of the overstory in itself is likely to 

provide stimuli that will break dormancy. 

Hilhorst and Karssen (2000) highlight the importance that physical and chemical environments have 

on the germination of seeds. There are several differences in the biotic and abiotic conditions of 

areas with native vegetation (where seeds were experimentally buried in experiment 2) and areas 

invaded by A. longifolia (where seeds are naturally buried in the seed bank, experiment 3). Light at 



 

85 

soil level and soil temperature are higher in non-invaded areas, while moisture and accumulated litter 

are higher in long-invaded areas with recently invaded areas always having intermediate values 

(E. Marchante, unpublished data). Nutrient contents (C, N, Ca2+, Na+, K+ and Mg2+) and microbial 

activity in the soil are generally higher in invaded than in non-invaded areas (Marchante et al., 2008). 

After entering the seed bank, seeds remain dormant until the testa becomes weathered and water-

permeable (Rolston, 1978). Different factors, such as N content or microbial activity, contribute to 

this process. Another cause of differential level of germinability has been noted in other Acacia 

species (Holmes and Moll, 1990) in that the hardness of the seed coat in each cohort of seeds is 

determined by the conditions under which the seeds mature. 

CONCLUSIONS  

In spite of the substantial and continual attrition in seed numbers during and following seed fall and 

in the soil seed bank, there is a substantial reservoir of viable seeds under and around A. longifolia 

thickets. These banks are the source of reinvasion after any clearing operations. Seeds in the soil 

remain viable for at least six years so the pool persists even if control operations disrupt recruitment 

of new seeds. Our findings show that managers have to be prepared to take immediate action after 

disturbances (e.g., fire or clearing operations) that cause changes in the coat properties of seeds 

and set off germination en masse. If nothing is done, the situation will worsen after disturbance.  

The results of this study also showed that seeds continue to accumulate in the soil with time and that 

the longer nothing is done about an invasion the more likely that there will be extensive and 

prolonged recruitment of new plants after initial clearing operations, requiring more resources to deal 

with the problem. Neglecting the problem will also allow invaded stands to advance by approximately 

1 m every 2-3 yr (i.e. the age at which new plants first set seeds) while some seeds will be dispersed 

greater distances, creating new invasion foci (Moody and Mack, 1988) representing a threat to non-

invaded areas, as already confirmed (Marchante et al., 2010; see chapter 4). Additional experiments 

are currently being conducted to identify the agents actively involved in long-range dispersal of 

A. longifolia seeds in these systems.

Chapter 4 

The potential role of seed-banks in the recovery of dune 

ecosystems after removal of invasive plant species  



 

92 

ABSTRACT 

Question: How resilient is the seed bank of an invaded dune system? Is that resilience dependent 

on duration of invasion? How does the accumulated litter layer contribute to the soil seed bank? 

Location: Coastal sand dunes invaded by Acacia longifolia, Portugal. 

Methods: Seedling emergence was used to quantify and compare soil seed banks in long-invaded, 

recently invaded and non-invaded areas. Changes in seed banks were also compared to areas 

where A. longifolia and the litter layer were removed. 

Results: Species richness, seedling density and diversity were higher in non-invaded and recently 

invaded areas, than in long-invaded areas. Although there was an apparent similarity between non-

invaded and recently invaded areas, analyses of species traits revealed differences. Non-invaded 

areas had a wider array of traits. Exotic/invasive species dominated invaded seed banks while native 

species dominated non-invaded seed banks. Life forms, growth forms, longevity and dispersal mode 

showed differences between areas, with cleared plots of long-invaded areas being apparently the 

most similar to non-invaded plots. Acacia longifolia seeds were most abundant in long-invaded 

areas, particularly where the litter layer remained. Removal of A. longifolia plus the litter had little 

effect on the seed bank composition of recently invaded areas but resulted in noticeable changes in 

seed banks of long-invaded areas. 

Conclusions: Long-invaded areas are less resilient and show a higher reinvasion potential, despite 

severe alteration of the seed banks of both areas. Seed bank studies can be a useful tool to guide 

management, but can give misleading results when invasion periods are protracted. 

Key-words: Acacia longifolia; diversity; dune ecosystems; resilience of invaded ecosystem; plant 

traits; seedling emergence.

INTRODUCTION 

Invasive species are currently considered one of the main threats to biodiversity worldwide 

(Rejmánek &amp;amp; Richardson 1996; Richardson &amp;amp; Pyšek 2008). Their impacts include declines in 

populations of native species (Chornesky &amp;amp; Randall 2003) and changes in ecosystems functioning 



 

93 

(Vitousek &amp;amp; Walker 1989; D'Antonio &amp;amp; Kark 2002; Peperkorn et al. 2005); they also have economic 

impacts (mainly through control efforts and decreasing productivity of agricultural land) (Pimentel et 

al. 2005) and there may be related health issues. In Portugal, as in other parts of the world, the 

problem is particularly acute in natural and semi-natural conservation areas (Coblentz 1990; Cowie &amp;amp; 

Werner 1993; Dana et al. 2003; Marchante et al. 2004; Aguiar et al. 2007; Foxcroft et al. 2007). 

Although control of invasive species is a priority, successful rehabilitation of natural habitats is 

ultimately determined by the extent to which native species are able to re-establish. Natural recovery 

of native flora in cleared areas depends largely on the availability of propagules, as well as abiotic 

conditions that favour their germination and survival (De Graaf et al. 1998).  

The soil seed bank includes viable seeds that are present in both the soil and associated litter layer 

(Simpson et al. 1989). Assessing seed bank attributes (species richness and composition, species 

guilds and seed density) can help to reveal the resilience of invaded ecosystems and to determine 

whether natural regeneration will suffice for rehabilitation or whether other interventions are required. 

Changes in structure are considered to be a sensitive measure of changes in a community (Elzinga 

et al. 2001). According to Frieswyk &amp;amp; Zedler (2006), a resilient seed bank has seed densities typical 

of the original system, with many species from many guilds, and a high proportion of native species. 

On the other hand, a degraded seed bank has atypical seed densities, few native species or guilds, 

or a high proportion of exotic species. 

Several authors - see Bossuyt &amp;amp; Honnay (2008) and references there in - are sceptical that 

restoration based on germination from soil seed banks can be successful and note that seed banks 

in invaded areas are usually dominated by low numbers of species. Nevertheless, other authors note 

that accumulations of dormant seeds allow native plants to persist through many years of invasion 

(Sternberg et al. 2003) and facilitate recovery in cleared areas. In Mediterranean climates the 

dominant species in the seed bank are annual plants that show adaptive responses to the 

unpredictable nature of the environment they inhabit by producing many seeds. Although the 

composition of aboveground communities does not necessarily reflect the abundance of species in 

the soil seed bank, in frequently-disturbed areas there is often a close correlation between adult 

plant species and species of seeds in the soil (Baptista &amp;amp; Shumway 1998). In densely invaded 

systems, seed bank studies can reveal species that have the potential to play a key role in the 

recovery of the ecosystem after control of the invasive species. The findings can be considered 

positive when they show that native species are well represented, and negative when undesirable 

species are predominant. Such information can be decisive when planning to embark on an 

expensive control programme. 



 

94 

Coastal dune ecosystems are considered a vulnerable ecosystem type by the International Union for 

Conservation of Nature and should have the highest priority for conservation action when significant 

biodiversity values are at risk (Shine et al. 2000). Due to stressful conditions (e.g. low soil fertility and 

water availability, sand movement, strong winds and salt spray from the sea) dune ecosystems have 

distinct phytocoenosis which are ecologically distinct (Carter 1995) and include high proportions of 

endemic species and habitats (Honrado et al. 2006). They are particularly vulnerable to disturbance 

through natural perturbations and human activities (Hanson &amp;amp; Lindh 1993; Carter 1995). The stability 

and natural dynamics of these ecosystems relies on their diversity of native plant species which bind 

the sand and curb erosion (van der Putten &amp;amp; Peters 1995). Along the Portuguese coast, pristine 

dune systems are becoming increasingly rare, with native species being replaced by several invasive 

exotic species (Alves et al. 1998). One of these species is Acacia longifolia (Andrews) Willd which 

threatens plant diversity, changes vegetation structure (Marchante et al. 2003; see chapter 2) and 

alters ecosystem functioning (Marchante et al. 2008b, c). 

Although A. longifolia is an aggressive invader in several ecosystems, including dunes, around the 

globe (Henderson 1995; Weber 2003; Elorza 2004; Marchante et al. 2008b), studies quantifying its 

impacts on natural seed banks and on the resilience of dune systems are scarce. Additionally, there 

is a general lack of data on soil seed banks of coastal sand dunes (Owen et al. 2001). In order to 

determine the role of seed banks in the restoration of invaded communities, and the susceptibility of 

such communities to reinvasion, the seed banks of areas that had been long- and recently invaded 

by A. longifolia were assessed and compared with non-invaded areas. An assessment was also 

made of the effect of removing A. longifolia plants with the underlying litter layer on the residual seed 

bank. We hypothesised that: 1) in degraded natural ecosystems that have been overrun with 

invasive species the potential for recovery declines with age of invasion because the composition of 

seed banks changes as seeds are removed from the system, through granivory, failed germination 

or decay, without being replenished; 2) most of the seeds of the invasive species will be near the soil 

surface so that removal of the litter layer along with the parent plants will reduce the capacity for 

reinvasion of cleared areas and; 3) the composition of native species will differ in situations where 

leaf litter is removed compared to areas where litter is left intact because seeds of some species 

occur predominantly in the surface layers while others occur at depth in the soil.  

More generally, the study serves as an example which should be of use to the many organisations 

globally that are responsible for the management of invasive plant species in natural areas. It shows 

the type of research that is required, and the kind of questions that should be asked, to get the 

information that is needed to understand the dynamics of the mix of seeds in the system and the 



 

95 

relative effects of different types of control operations on these seeds. Doing so will enable 

managers to develop control methods which will maximise removal of the invader while fostering 

seeds of desirable species along with abiotic conditions that favour their germination. 

MATERIAL AND METHODS  

Study area - The study area was located in the São Jacinto Dunes Nature Reserve (SJDNR) which 

is situated on the central-northern coast of Portugal (40º 39’ N, 8º 44’ W). The reserve covers about 

660 ha and is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the West and by the Ria de Aveiro estuary to the 

East (location provided at the Appendix 4.1). The climate is Mediterranean with Atlantic influence, a 

mean annual precipitation of 920 mm and mean monthly temperatures ranging from 10.2ºC in 

January to 20.2ºC in June. Dominant winds blow from Northwest and North, approaching from the 

Ocean. Historically the area supported open vegetation characterized by shrubs, sub-shrubs and 

herbs and sporadic small trees. The reserve has been extensively invaded by A. longifolia which 

threatens the high conservation value of the region (Marchante et al. 2004; Marchante et al. 2007). 

Besides A. longifolia, the reserve has also been invaded to a lesser extent by Carpobrotus edulis (L.) 

N.E.Br. (ice plant) and Cortaderia selloana (Schultes) Asch. &amp;amp; Graebner (pampas grass). 

Acacia longifolia was introduced into SJDNR early in the 20th century to curb movement of sand in 

coastal areas, has subsequently proliferated in several areas and has invaded about two thirds of 

SJDNR. The stands in SJDNR can be divided into long-invaded and recently invaded areas. Long-

invaded areas have had dense stands (over 80% cover) of A. longifolia for several decades and are 

largely restricted to a small area located along the South border of the SJDNR, where the sands are 

stabilized. The recently invaded areas came about during the 1995 summer when A. longifolia 

proliferated (with cover reaching 70%) over a large, previously-unaffected area of the reserve after a 

natural fire which destroyed about 200 ha, eliminating pine plantations and dune vegetation (Silva 

1997) in both the primary and stabilized dunes. Before the fire, the burnt areas had low numbers of 

A. longifolia plants, mostly in the under-story of Pinus pinaster Aiton. 

Large areas of SJDNR support almost mono-specific stands of A. longifolia trees which are causing 

a significant change in the community structure (Marchante et al. 2003; chapter 2) and ecosystem 

functioning (Marchante et al. 2008b; c). These changes include 1) replacement of diverse plant 

communities, dominated by herbs, sub-shrubs and shrubs species (Neto 1993; Honrado et al. 2006), 

with arboreal stands largely dominated by A. longifolia with native plant species occurring 

infrequently in the understory (chapter 2), and 2) the deposition of large quantities of leaf litter 



 

96 

ranging from (mean ±SE) 2.05 ± 0.24 Kg.m-2 in long-invaded areas to 1.43 ± 0.14 Kg.m-2 in recently 

invaded areas as opposed to 0.55 ± 0.09 Kg.m-2 in non-invaded areas (Marchante et al. 2008b).  

Experimental design - To assess the effects of the A. longifolia invasion on the composition of the 

soil seed bank, two experiments were performed: 

Effect of invasion status on the seed banks – the seed bank composition in areas recently 

invaded and long-invaded by A. longifolia was compared with non-invaded areas. Non-invaded areas 

were selected inside SJDNR on the basis that: a) they were in a comparable dune situation 

(interdune, stabilized dune) to the invaded areas; and b) there were no A. longifolia trees in the area. 

Small open areas within the invaded areas contain remnants of the native vegetation, with several 

species in common with the non-invaded areas, indicating that they had the same floral elements 

and seed banks prior to the invasion by A. longifolia. In each area five 10 X 10 m plots were 

established from which soil samples were collected (see below). 

Effect of A. longifolia and litter removal on the seed banks - in both the long-invaded and 

recently invaded areas a complete randomized block design was used to define five blocks, each 

consisting of two 10 X 10 m plots. Each pair of two plots was similar before treatments application. 

One of two treatments was randomly assigned to one plot in each block. The treatments were: a) 

plots cleared of A. longifolia by cutting the trees with chainsaws at ground level after which the leaf 

litter layer was removed (designated the ‘ALR’ treatment); and b) untreated plots with both 

A. longifolia and litter left intact (designated the ‘A’ treatment) (these were the same plots that were 

sampled in experiment 1 above). Trees and litter were removed in October 2002 and seed bank 

samples were collected in December 2002.  

Seedling emergency method was used to assess the composition of seed banks. There are some 

known limitations with the method (e.g. species whose seeds require specific stimuli to germinate 

may not be detected) but these are outweighed by the advantages, namely that it readily eliminates 

inviable seeds, which can confound the results, and that seedlings are usually more easy to identify 

than seeds. In each plot, three soil samples (15 samples per treatment; cylindrical cores 7.5 cm in 

diameter and 10 cm deep) were collected. A total volume of 6623 cm3 of soil was collected from a 

surface area of 662 cm2 within each treatment. The soil was then sieved (1 cm mesh) to extract 

stones, coarse roots and other plant material before being spread on a layer of sterilized subsoil in a 

tray (10 x 20 cm in area; 5 cm deep). Trays were kept in a green house with regular irrigation (twice 

a day) and ambient light and temperature conditions. Germinating seeds were registered fortnightly 

and seedlings were grown until positive identification was possible. The plants were then removed 



 

97 

and preserved as herbarium specimens (Herbarium from Escola Superior Agrária de Coimbra). A set 

of control trays was installed with a layer of sterilized subsoil only and the seedlings that appeared in 

these were used to correct numbers in the experimental trays for dates after appearance. Seedling 

emergence was monitored until no seeds germinated for at least 13 months (January 2004). 

Data analysis  

Species richness, seedlings density and quantity of A. longifolia seedlings - were analysed 

separately for each experiment. For these three parameters data from the three trays of each plot 

were first gathered in a composite sample. Data are presented per 133 cm2 which corresponds to 

the area of three soil cores. To evaluate the effect of the invasion status (experiment 1) on each 

parameter a General Linear Model (GLM), with a between-subject design One-Way ANOVA was 

performed. The effect of invasion age and clearing treatment (experiment 2) was evaluated with a 

GLM, with a between-subject design Factorial ANOVA. Significant differences detected were then 

located with the LSD post-hoc test at 5% level of significance. Data on seedlings density of both 

experiments had to be log transformed ( ( )1log +x ) to fulfil ANOVA assumptions (Zar 1996). 

Seedlings that died before positive identification were included in the measures of seedling 

abundance but not in the analyses of separate species. All the statistical analyses were performed 

using STATISTICA 6.0 (StatSoft, Inc. 2001, www.statsoft.com). 

Seedlings diversity and similarity between seed banks – these parameters were analysed, and 

are presented, together (experiment 1 and 2 combined) in order to avoid data repetition. Shannon 

diversity index was calculated for each invasion status and clearing treatment and compared using a 

t test proposed by Hutcheson (1970); the index of Shannon ranges from 0 to ? 5, but is usually 

found to fall between 1.5 and 3.5 (Magurran 1988).  

Similarity between seed banks regarding species composition at different invasion status and 

treatments were analysed with Sorensen´s Similarity Coefficient (( ( )BACQS += /2 , where A and 

B are the species numbers in samples A and B, respectively, and C is the number of species shared 

by the two samples), which varies between 0 (different) and 1 (identical).  

Functional traits - the seedlings were additionally categorized into functional and other traits (Table 

4.1). For every treatment and invasion status, the number of seedlings with each attribute was 

summed and divided by the total number of seedlings to produce a relative abundance of seedlings 

with each attribute. Acacia longifolia seedlings and all the other species were treated separately in 

the analyses. Seedlings that did not survive to a stage of development where they could be identified 



 

98 

to the species level were allocated to attributes whenever possible; the remaining seedlings were 

classified as “undetermined”. 

For calculation of these three parameters, species abundances of all trays of each invasion status 

and treatment were first summed to get a total value of abundances per species.

RESULTS 

Species richness, seedlings abundance and quantity of A. longifolia seedlings 

Overall, 1322 seedlings representing 42 taxa germinated in the trays, including 39 identifiable 

species, two species that could only be placed at genus level and one species that could only be 

placed at family level (Appendix 4.2). Of these, 182 did not survive long enough to allow 

identification. The unidentifiable seedlings had morphological characters which indicated that they 

represented predominantly three species and a rare fourth species. Only one species (Salix 

atrocinerea Brot.) germinated in the control trays (four seedlings in all) and this figure was used to 



 

99 

adjust counts in the sample trays. Most of the species were herbs, predominantly from Asteraceae 

(in all areas) and Caryophyllaceae (in recently invaded areas). Two graminoid taxa, Poaceae (in 

recently invaded area) and Juncaceae (in non-invaded areas), were also represented by several 

species. Although only five exotic species were identified, three of these were very abundant, namely 

Conyza sp., Gamochaeta pensylvanica and A. longifolia (Appendix 4.2). 

Effect of invasion status on the seed banks – The density of seedlings was more than double in 

recently invaded and non-invaded areas than in long-invaded areas (F 2, 12 = 6.08, P = 0.015) 

(Figure 4.1a). Species richness was also affected by invasion status (F 2, 12 = 3.86, P = 0.050) with 

long-invaded areas having fewer species than recently invaded areas (Figure 4.1b). The seed banks 

of long-invaded areas had ca. 4-fold more A. longifolia seedlings than the seed banks of both 

recently- and non-invaded areas (F 2, 12 = 5.76, P = 0.018) (Figure 4.1c).

same letters are not significantly different (LSD &amp;lt;0.05). Acacia longifolia was not included in (a) and (b). 

Effect of A. longifolia and litter removal on the seed banks - Although invasion age affected 

seedling density in long-invaded and recently invaded areas separately (see experiment 1), there 

was no between factors interaction (F1,16 = 1.54, P = 0.233) nor clearing treatment effect 

(F 1, 16 = 0.004, P = 0.951) (Figure 4.2a). There was a significant interaction between invasion age 

and treatments on species richness (F 1, 16 = 8.42, P = 0.010) with untreated plots (A) of recently 

invaded areas containing more species than all of the other plots (Figure 4.2b). The number of 

A. longifolia seedlings was affected by both the invasion age (F 1, 16 = 15.08, P = 0.001) and the 

treatments (F 1, 16 = 5.56, P = 0.031), with a nearly-significant interaction between these factors 

(F 1,16 = 3.77, P = 0.07) (Figure 4.2c). The clearing treatment (ALR) in long-invaded areas markedly 

reduced the quantity of A. longifolia seedlings to levels similar to both plots (A and ALR) of recently 

invaded areas (Figure 4.2c).

Seedlings diversity - In uncleared plots (A) diversity was significantly higher (p = 0.015) in recently 

invaded areas (2.21) than in long-invaded areas (2.01), but clearing (ALR) inverted the trend 

(recently invaded = 1.81, long-invaded = 2.06; p = 0.005). In long-invaded areas, clearing did not 

affect diversity (A = 2.01, ALR = 2.06; p = 0.34), while in recently invaded areas clearing caused a 

significant decrease in diversity (A = 2.21, ALR = 1.81; p &amp;lt;0.0001). In recently invaded areas, 

clearing of A. longifolia and litter (ALR) resulted in diversity that was increasingly different from non-

invaded areas (A = 2.21, non-invaded = 2.23, p = 0.43; ALR &amp;lt;non-invaded, p &amp;lt;0.0001), while in 

long-invaded areas clearing resulted in diversity that was (barely) equal to non-invaded areas 

(A &amp;lt;non-invaded, p = 0.027; ALR = non-invaded, p = 0.062). 

Similarity between seed banks - Similarity between invaded areas and non-invaded areas declined 

with length of A. longifolia invasion, with QS = 0.49 being recorded for the pairing of recently invaded 

untreated plots (A) and non-invaded plots, and decreasing to QS = 0.39 for the pairing of long-

invaded untreated plots (A) and non-invaded areas. When A. longifolia plus litter were removed 

(ALR) the similarity between non-invaded species composition and invaded areas increased in both 

recently invaded areas (QS = 0.61) and long-invaded areas (QS = 0.55). 

The similarity value (QS) of the species composition of seed banks was highest (0.67) between the 

untreated (A) and cleared plots (ALR) of long-invaded areas. In recently invaded areas, A and ALR 

were more dissimilar (QS = 0.57). The clearing treatments promoted similarity with QS rising from 

0.44 for the comparison of uncleared plots (A) in recently invaded and long-invaded areas to 0.53 for 

the comparison of cleared plots (ALR) in the two areas.

Seed bank functional and other traits  

Although seedling density, species richness and diversity were similar in recently invaded and non-

invaded areas, the analyses of species traits and their relative abundances revealed substantial 

differences between these two areas (Figure 4.3). Even greater differences in trait attributes were 

noted when the seed banks of long-invaded areas were compared to those of recently invaded and 

non-invaded areas. In general, the clearing treatment (ALR) induced more changes in community 

structure in long-invaded areas than in recently invaded areas. Broadly, seed banks from non-

invaded areas displayed a wider array and exhibited more even distribution of trait attributes than 

those from any of the invaded areas. The proportions of undetermined seedlings in the different 

areas varied between ca. 10% and 20%. 

More than 30% of the seedlings that germinated in the samples from the untreated (A) long-invaded 

areas were A. longifolia. Recently invaded areas had the highest proportion of seedlings of other 

exotic and invasive species (Figure 4.3a). The exotic species detected in the seed banks were 

Conyza spp. and Gamochaeta pensylvanica (Willd.) Cabrera (very abundant particularly in recently 

invaded areas), Carpobrotus edulis (sporadic exclusively in long-invaded samples) and Cortaderia 

selloana (sporadic and only in recently invaded samples) (Appendix 4.2). Altogether, different 

classes of native species made up more than 65% of the seedlings that germinated in the samples 

from non-invaded areas, thus greatly exceeding the proportions observed in both invaded areas. The 

higher proportion of native species were seedlings from dune/generalist species. 

Non-invaded areas showed the highest number of life forms (Figure 4.3b), only equalled by cleared 

plots (ALR) of long-invaded areas. The relative abundance of life forms was similar in both 

treatments of recently invaded areas, with therophytes comprising the vast majority of seedlings that 

germinated. In long-invaded areas the clearing treatment promoted greater changes in the 

proportions of life forms, with therophytes predominating in cleared plots (ALR), but being 

outnumbered by A. longifolia seedlings in the samples from untreated plots (A). Microphanerophytes 

(represented in the region by Myrica faya Aiton) only germinated rarely and exclusively in trays from 

untreated long-invaded areas (A). Chamaephytes, hemicryptophytes, cryptophytes and 

nanophanerophytes were vestigial in all areas.

Figure 4.3 Relative abundance of emerged seedlings with each attribute of the plant traits (functional and 
other groups) analysed for seed banks of areas non-invaded, long-invaded and recently invaded by 
A. longifolia, in cleared (ALR) and untreated (A) areas: (a) species categories according to their origin &amp;amp; 
habitat; (b) life forms; (c) growth form; (d) longevity; (e) main dispersal agent; (f) taxonomic diversity according 
to families (families with proportionally less than 5% were grouped under “other families”; details in Appendix 
4.2). 

The seedlings that germinated in the samples from both invaded areas were mainly herbs 

(herbaceous dicotyledons), while graminoids and herbs were more evenly represented among the 

seeds that germinated in the samples from non-invaded areas (Figure 4.3c). In long-invaded areas 

the removal of both A. longifolia and litter (ALR) almost excluded graminoids. Shrubs and trees 

(except for A. longifolia itself) were poorly represented (no more than 1-2%) with shrubs occurring 



 

103 

only in cleared plots (ALR) from both invaded areas and non-invaded areas and trees occurring only 

in untreated plots (A) from long-invaded areas. 

Almost all the seedlings that germinated were short-lived species (Figure 4.3d) with the exception of 

those that germinated in the samples from untreated plots (A) of long-invaded areas, where 

A. longifolia (a perennial) was more abundant. Perennials were almost excluded from the seed 

banks of recently invaded areas. Seedlings of species dispersed by wind were dominant in almost all 

situations (Figure 4.3e). A greater proportion of seedlings in the samples from non-invaded areas 

were species that are dispersed by animals.  

In terms of taxonomic diversity, Asteraceae was proportionally by far the most abundant family, 

being only outnumbered by A. longifolia in the untreated plots (A) from long-invaded areas (Figure 

4.3f). The next most prominent taxa were Poaceae and Caryophyllaceae in recently invaded areas 

and Juncaceae in the non-invaded area. Seeds from almost all the other families were present in low 

numbers (rarely up to 1% of seedlings) and showed some differences between treatments and 

invasion ages (Appendix 4.2.) Aizoaceae, Rubiaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Scrophulariaceae and 

Myricaceae were only detected in long-invaded areas, the last being absent from cleared plots 

(ALR). Primulaceae and Onagraceae were only found in samples from recently invaded areas. 

Fabaceae (excluding A. longifolia) only occurred in the non-invaded areas. 

DISCUSSION 

Frequently-disturbed areas often show a close correlation between adult plants and soil seed bank 

species (Baptista &amp;amp; Shumway 1998). The system under investigation is highly disturbed by the 

invasion of an exotic species, which may have impacts that are different to other kinds of 

disturbance, and, to a lesser extent, by human pressure (tourism) and management practices (e.g. 

firebreaks and trails management). Our results show that the invaded seed banks at SJDNR do not 

clearly resemble either the quasi-mono-specific invaded system or the original interdune dune 

community, present before invasion (Neto 1993), although several species characteristic of the 

dunes persisted to invasion contributing to recovery of cleared areas (Sternberg et al. 2003). 

Effects of invasion status on the seed bank  

A resilient seed bank should include seed densities typical of the system, several species from 

several guilds, and a high proportion of native species. On the other hand, degraded seed banks 

have altered densities of seeds, few species or guilds and a high proportion of exotic invasive 



 

104 

species (Frieswyk &amp;amp; Zedler 2006). Both invaded seed banks showed signs of severe degradation, 

being largely dominated by a few species (Bossuyt &amp;amp; Honnay 2008), namely exotic/invasive species. 

The exotics Conyza spp. and Gamochaeta pensylvanica, both short-lived species, clearly dominated 

the seed bank of recently invaded areas, despite not being particularly abundant in the extant 

vegetation (Marchante et al. 2004), while the long-invaded seed bank was dominated by the 

perennial A. longifolia accompanied by a few seeds of Carpobrotus edulis, also perennial. The higher 

longevity of the exotic/invasive species present in the seed banks of long-invaded areas indicates a 

more long lasting threat to these areas. Seeds of Acacia species, in particular, are known to have 

very high longevity (Cavanagh 1980; Daws et al. 2007), waiting in the soil for suitable conditions to 

germinate. On the other hand, the natural seed bank of non-invaded areas were more resilient, 

having a higher diversity of guilds, low abundances of exotic/invasive species and high proportions of 

native species, even though only a small proportion were dune specialists. However, the presence of 

A. longifolia seeds in areas not yet invaded showed that there is a risk of future invasion, especially 

after a fire event.  

When subject to disturbance, seed bank densities of plant communities may show distinct changes, 

either increasing or decreasing (Pierce &amp;amp; Cowling 1991). In any case, the density of seeds in 

degraded communities is frequently distinct from that of corresponding unaltered communities 

(Frieswyk &amp;amp; Zedler 2006), which is corroborated by this study: both the decrease in the density of 

seeds in long-invaded areas and the increase in total seed density in recently invaded areas (mostly 

due to the exotic annuals referred to above) (Appendix 4.2) indicates degradation. 

Measures of species richness, diversity, attributes of some plant traits, amount of A. longifolia seeds 

and similarity to non-invaded areas indicate that seed banks in long-invaded areas are more altered 

than those of recently invaded areas. For instance, Caryophyllaceae were absent and Poaceae were 

underrepresented in long-invaded seed banks, while both taxa were still well represented in recently 

invaded and non-invaded seed banks. The discrepancy could be due to the short-lived seeds which 

characterise several species of both these families. Studies have shown that Cerastium diffusum 

(Caryophyllaceae) (Mack 1976) and Vulpia fasciculata (Poaceae) (Watkinson 1978) do not 

accumulate long-lived soil seed banks in dunes. Long-invaded areas are therefore more 

impoverished of native species and are more likely to be reinvaded following manual clearing or fire. 

Similar trends have been found in areas invaded by other Acacia species in South Africa (Holmes &amp;amp; 

Cowling 1997a; Holmes 2002), although invasion ages were not always monitored in those studies.  

In long-invaded areas, where A. longifolia had been present continuously for at least 20 years, the 

dense canopy and the thick litter layer has at least curtailed, if not prevented, the deposition of seeds 



 

105 

from surrounding areas (e.g. from zoochorous species), as happens in other closed forest systems 

(Sayer 2006). Zoochorous plant species do not seem to cope well with A. longifolia invasion (Holmes 

&amp;amp; Cowling 1997b), being underrepresented in invaded areas while remaining frequent in non-

invaded areas. In the recently invaded areas, movement of seeds (particularly from anemochorous 

species) into the area continued because the canopy of A. longifolia was more open (ca. 70%) and 

the litter layer was more sparse (1.43 ± 0.14 Kg.m-2) than in the long-invaded areas (at least 80% 

A. longifolia cover and 2.05 ± 0.24 Kg.m-2 of litter). The time of invasion would also affect seed bank 

traits because the viability of seeds (particularly small seeds) buried for long periods under thick litter 

layers diminishes (Eckstein &amp;amp; Donath 2005) along with the ability of viable seeds to germinate 

successfully in thick litter layers (Facelli &amp;amp; Pickett 1991). Noticeably, however, some dune -specific 

species, e.g. Antirrhinum majus L. cirrhigerum (Ficalho) Franco, with larger and longer-lived seeds 

(Shah et al. 2008) seem to have either overcome the barriers to immigration into thickets or survived 

the protracted periods of invasion, being exclusively detected (despite rarely) in long-invaded areas. 

Their absence in recently invaded areas could be due to the seeds being destroyed by the fire of 

1995 and there not being enough time between the fire and sample acquisition for fresh seeds to 

spread into and accumulate in the invaded patches. 

The high proportion of therophytes in the seed banks was expected as their establishment from seed 

is obligatory (Fenner &amp;amp; Thompson 2005), they are frequent in Portuguese dune ecosystems (Alves 

et al. 1998; Costa et al. 2000) and include many ‘opportunistic’ species, despite having limited 

conservation value (some are exotics). Being short-lived annual species that are relatively small, 

they are largely unable to compete with A. longifolia which is a large perennial species. 

Nevertheless, if therophytes create a dense cover over the soil surface, they may reduce 

germination of A. longifolia seeds and provide a transitional cover which will later be replaced by the 

less-numerous native perennial species in the seed bank. The seeds of perennial species are 

usually sparse in seed banks and these plants frequently have an ability to propagate from 

perennating buds located on storage structures as an alternative mean of reproduction (Sternberg et 

al. 2003). Some natural sand dunes lack persistent seed banks because conditions that induce 

dormancy (namely poorly aerated soils) are not always met (Owen et al. 2001). Additionally, 

recruitment of new individuals may have been limited (Thompson &amp;amp; Ceriani 2003) because some 

species require heat (Buhk &amp;amp; Hensen 2005), smoke (Reyes &amp;amp; Trabaud 2009), passage through 

animal intestines (Calviño-Cancela 2004) or other cues to induce germination and facilitate seedling 

emergence (Sternberg et al. 2003; Cottrell 2004). The lack of these types of cues in the glasshouse 



 

106 

could partially explain why ca. 15% of the seedlings in this study (potentially some perennial species) 

did not survive to a stage where they could be identified. 

Nevertheless, the lack of nanophanerophytes and chamaephytes (long-lived perennials, with many 

species characteristic of dunes, some with high conservation value), such as Corema album (L.) D. 

Don and Cytisus grandiflorus (Brot.) DC. (both endemic of the Iberian Peninsula), Herniaria ciliolata 

Melderis subsp. robusta Chaudhri and Iberis procumbens Lange subsp. procumbens (both endemic 

in Europe), Crucianela maritima L. and Helichrysum italicum (Roth) G. Don fil. subsp. picardi (Costa 

et al. 2000; Marchante et al. 2004; Silva 2006), and the very low numbers of other species, including 

Cistus salvifolius L. and Ulex europaeus L. subsp. latebracteatus (Mariz) Rothm, could also be an 

indication of a general degradation of seed banks in the studied dunes. Sampling size could also 

have contributed to the low levels of detection of these species. The deficiency of dune specialists, 

particularly in non-invaded areas, may be due to the fact that the selected non-invaded areas were 

not the most “typical” dune system, but rather the only places in the reserve that were located in 

dune situations that were equivalent to the invaded areas while being free of A. longifolia trees. In 

these areas graminoid species frequently predominate and apparently largely suppress germination 

of A. longifolia seeds. The graminoid species that were present (Juncus spp. and Carex arenaria L.) 

are frequently associated with relatively moist soils, which were also characteristic of some of the 

long-invaded areas where A. longifolia dominated. Species of Juncus and Carex produce very large 

amounts of small, long-lived seeds that are abundant in several communities (Bossuyt &amp;amp; Honnay 

2008). The presence of these taxa may explain the higher density of seeds when compared to seed 

banks of other sand dunes systems (7-12 germinable seeds.m-2) (Owen et al. 2001).  

Bossuyt &amp;amp; Honnay (2008) analysed numerous community seed banks and support the notion that 

restoration from natural seed bank is only possible in areas degraded for less than five years. Our 

study corroborates this, at least partially, showing a decrease in the unaided recovery potential of the 

system as invasion age increases. Other studies in the SJDNR have shown that other parameters, 

namely microbiological and chemical properties of the soil in long-invaded stands of A. longifolia are 

also more altered and take more time to recover than in recently invaded stands (Marchante et al. 

2009). 

Effect of A. longifolia and litter removal on the seed banks 

The effect of removing A. longifolia and the litter layer on species richness, diversity and amount of 

A. longifolia seeds varied with age of invasion. Removing A. longifolia and the litter layer resulted in 

greater similarity of the seed banks of long-invaded and recently invaded areas, indicating that an 



 

107 

important part of the differences observed between invaded seed banks occurs among seeds that 

have accumulated over time in the litter layers.  

Removing A. longifolia and the litter did not affect species diversity, species richness and seed bank 

density in long-invaded areas. However, litter removal decreased the number of A. longifolia 

seedlings, changed several trait spectra and left a seed bank whose species composition more 

closely resembled the seed banks of adjacent non-invaded areas, eventually creating a more-

resilient seed bank (Frieswyk &amp;amp; Zedler 2006). Removing A. longifolia and litter resulted in a further 

decline of some taxa (e.g. Cyperaceae, Rubiaceae, Myricaceae) that had accumulated in the litter 

layer. Nevertheless, this loss was offset to some extent because other taxa appeared in the cleared 

areas. These were presumably recent additions which arrived during the short interval between 

clearing and collection of seed samples. Most of the plants in this group were herbaceous, short-

lived, wind-dispersed species (particularly Asteraceae) which are frequently opportunistic and typical 

from early succession stages, and included both native generalists and exotics. More importantly, 

removing the litter decreased the number of A. longifolia seeds in long-invaded areas and thereby 

decreased the reinvasion potential of the invader. Indeed, moderate controlled fire could be used to 

eliminate the thick litter layer and simultaneously destroy many seeds of the invasive species 

(Richardson &amp;amp; Kluge 2008).  

The number of species, particularly natives, and diversity declined in recently invaded areas when 

A. longifolia and the litter were removed, indicating that this type of clearing operation caused a 

further degradation of the seed bank (Frieswyk &amp;amp; Zedler 2006). Nevertheless, there was 

considerable similarity in the species composition of seed banks in recently invaded and non-

invaded areas and clearing treatment did not induce changes in most plant traits. Invasion for a few 

years meant that the canopy was relatively open until recently so that seeds of other plant species 

continued to accumulate in the litter layer and the time interval was too short for natural attrition of 

the original seeds to have taken affect to any great extent. Removing the litter caused a decline or 

disappearance of some types of seeds, with at least 10 species being lost (Appendix 4.2), an 

outcome that would inadvertently contribute to a decline in the resilience of the system.  

Although there are limitations in using seedling emergence to monitor species assemblages 

(Sternberg et al. 2003; Cottrell 2004), the method had benefits in this case because it: 1) allows an 

estimation of the available seed bank without major clearing efforts; 2) revealed species that were 

otherwise unseen in the invaded stands; and 3) indicated the invasion potential of A. longifolia, 

particularly in non-invaded areas. The results of this study indicated that due to higher 

impoverishment of the seed bank in long-invaded areas, recovery will probably be more dependent 



 

108 

on the input of new seeds into cleared patches from neighbouring areas, a pattern that may not be 

easily predicted when sampling the resident seed bank. Due to low seed densities, patchiness of 

seed banks and short interval between clearing operations and sampling collection, it is not possible 

to confirm that seeds only found in cleared areas (ALR) had necessarily dispersed from neighbouring 

areas. Some may have germinated in trays due to litter removal and/or disturbance during the 

experimental manipulations. Increasing the sampling size could eventually contribute do detect more 

species. 

CONCLUSIONS 

As hypothesized, the results of this investigation showed that seed banks of areas invaded by 

A. longifolia for a longer period are more altered than the ones from recently invaded areas, 

suggesting that resilience of the system decreases as invasion time increases, namely because 

recovery of native plants from residual seed banks declines with time. The recovery of the coastal 

dunes is threatened by the overwhelming presence of A. longifolia and other aggressive invasive 

species in the seed bank. This situation becomes increasingly problematic with time because seeds 

of short-lived exotic species in recently invaded areas are replaced by seeds of perennial invader 

species in long-invaded areas. Regarding clearing treatment effects, there was a somewhat 

unexpected difference between invaded areas. The removal of A. longifolia trees and litter layer in 

long-invaded areas resulted in few species being lost and higher similarity with native areas, 

including functional trait spectra, which may further enhance recovery of the system. In recently 

invaded areas, on the contrary, the removal of litter contributed to a further degradation of the seed 

bank, with many species being lost and a decrease in diversity when compared with areas where 

A. longifolia remained. The results also show that the assessment of traits other than species 

richness, abundance and diversity of the soil seed bank revealed patterns that would otherwise have 

been unnoticed. 

From a management point of view, if invaded areas are left intact, more vigorous and probably more 

expensive management efforts will then be needed if the invaded systems are to be restored. A 

strategy to control or manage A. longifolia needs to include dealing with reinvasion by seedlings and 

sustaining the recovery of native communities, mainly in the long-invaded areas where the removal 

of the litter layer was an effective mechanism for decreasing the amount of A. longifolia seeds in the 

system. Although many native species are present including several species characteristic of the 

dunes, which is positive, many others are missing which, especially when summed with exotics, is 

negative and needs to be considered when planning recovery strategies. Seed banks alone do not 



 

109 

seem to be sufficient to allow full system recovery after clearing. Chapter 5 evaluates the recovery of 

vegetation after the removal of trees with or without the litter layer, including the time factor, which 

further assists in the validation of the present approach.

Post-clearing recovery of coastal dunes invaded by Acacia 

longifolia: is duration of invasion relevant for management 

success? 



 

118 

ABSTRACT  

1. Despite having the highest priority for conservation by IUCN, the structure and function of many 

coastal dunes are threatened by invasive plant species. In Portuguese dunes, Acacia longifolia is 

one of the most prominent invasive species. Removal of invasive plants is crucial for preventing loss 

of biodiversity but the likelihood that restoration efforts will succeed should be assessed before 

embarking in expensive management plans. However, post-clearing studies are scarce, usually 

short-term and rarely consider duration of invasion. 

2. Recovery of plant communities was monitored over six years in a coastal dune after removal of 

A. longifolia either with or without the associated litter layer. Duration of the invasion period before 

clearing was considered. Species richness, plant cover, diversity, evenness, species traits and 

turnover rates were analysed. 

3. Duration of invasion was the main determinant of resilience of invaded systems. Recently invaded 

areas had higher species richness, plant cover, initial diversity and turnover rates than long-invaded 

areas. The post-clearing flora of both areas was dominated by generalist native species which, over 

time, were increasingly replaced by species more adapted to dunes. However, six years after 

removal of A. longifolia several species typical of dunes were still missing. Exotic species were more 

abundant in recently invaded areas. Therophytes were the most abundant life form immediately after 

clearing but nanophanerophytes, chamaephytes and A. longifolia increased with time. 

4. Seedlings of A. longifolia were more abundant in cleared long-invaded areas. Effects of litter 

removal were most evident in cleared long-invaded areas, promoting increased species richness and 

plant cover, and decreasing susceptibility to reinvasion. 

Synthesis and applications: Sand dunes densely invaded by a woody species have some inherent 

resilience but, as the invasion periods extends, recovery of the original communities is increasingly 

less likely and the probability of reinvasion increases. Therefore, more-recently invaded areas should 

be prioritized for clearing. When invasion is accompanied by an accumulation of litter, this should be 

removed to enhance recovery of native flora. In most situations, restoration needs to be supported 

by active management actions (e.g. litter removal, transplantations, fire); to establish the original 

ecosystem may be an unrealistic restoration target. 

Keywords: ecosystem resilience, Fabaceae/Leguminosae, Sydney golden wattle, long-term 

monitoring post-clearing, invasion time, experimental litter removal, reinvasion post-clearing.

INTRODUCTION 

Invasive plant species are considered one of the primary threats to biodiversity (Richardson et al., 

2000; Richardson et al., 2008; Gaertner et al., 2009) as well as to the integrity and function of 

ecosystems (Vitousek, 1990; Blossey, 1999; Marchante et al., 2008a). Ever-escalating problems 

caused by invasive species increasingly require intervention for their removal and the restoration of 

natural habitats. Before embarking on expensive management programs, the probability that 

restoration efforts will succeed should be assessed, including the possibility that the invasive species 

will reinvade after its initial removal (Zavaleta, Hobbs &amp;amp; Mooney, 2001). Long-term monitoring after 

control operations can provide valuable ecological information by revealing how changes in the 

abundance of species influences properties and processes of ecosystems, which in turn helps to 

guide management decisions (Blossey, 1999). Despite these real benefits, most studies on the 

effects of invasive plants removal are of short duration and/or frequently fail to include effects on 

native plant species (Ogden &amp;amp; Rejmánek, 2005; Hejda &amp;amp; Pyšek, 2006). 

Coastal ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to disturbance and have been given the highest 

priority for conservation action by IUCN (Shine, Williams &amp;amp; Gündling, 2000). Coastal dune 

ecosystems are not only fundamental barriers against the advance of the ocean (Carter, 1995), they 

also harbour endemic plant species and form unique habitats (Honrado et al., 2006). The stability 

and natural dynamics of coastal dunes relies on natural plant communities which stabilise the labile 

sands and minimize the effects of erosion (van der Putten &amp;amp; Peters, 1995). 

Along the Portuguese coast, pristine dune systems are becoming increasingly rare, with native plant 

species being replaced by several invasive exotic species, including Acacia longifolia (Andrews) 

Willd (Alves et al., 1998; Marchante, Marchante &amp;amp; Freitas, 2003), A. saligna (Labill.) H.L. Wendl. 

(Marchante, 2001), Carpobrotus edulis (L.) N. E. Br. (Campelo, 2000) and Cortaderia selloana 

(Schultes) Asch. &amp;amp; Graebner (Marchante, Freitas &amp;amp; Marchante, 2008). Acacia longifolia (long-leafed 

wattle) (Fabaceae/ Leguminosae), the most prominent and widespread invader in Portuguese dunes, 

was introduced in early 20th century to curb sand erosion. Besides deliberate planting, its abundance 

and distribution has increased greatly following fire events with major impacts that escalate with time 

(Marchante et al., 2008b; chapter 2). In common with other Acacia species, A. longifolia is a nitrogen 

fixing tree (Rodríguez-Echeverría, Crisóstomo &amp;amp; Freitas, 2007) that produces large quantities of 

slowly-decomposing litter (Pereira, Graca &amp;amp; Molles, 1998; Marchante, 2008) which accumulates in 

deep layers beneath the almost mono-specific, dense stands in dune areas which are otherwise 

almost litter deprived. 



 

120 

Plant litter and its decomposition are considered a vital part of ecosystem functioning, increasingly 

influencing vegetation structure as litter accumulates (Xiong &amp;amp; Nilsson, 1999). Its effects vary among 

ecosystems and depend on litter composition and quantity, with repercussion for species richness 

and above-ground biomass (Facelli &amp;amp; Pickett, 1991; Sayer, 2006). In general, litter suppresses 

germination of small seeds and seedling establishment, while germination of large seeds and 

seedling establishment are facilitated (Sayer, 2006). Suppression occurs because litter forms a 

barrier which prevents seeds from reaching the soil. Small seeds that germinate in the litter layer fail 

either because their roots do not reach the soil, or their shoots are unable to reach the surface 

(Facelli &amp;amp; Pickett, 1991). In large-seeded species survival may be facilitated because the seeds are 

less likely to be retained by the litter and input of nutrients from the decomposing litter may nurture 

seedlings while the litter protects the seeds and seedlings from predators (Sayer, 2006). The 

potential for major disruption of ecosystems is most evident when invasive species that produce 

large quantities of litter invade ecosystems that naturally have less litter. In such cases, the ever 

increasing quantities of litter result in abnormal accumulations of organic matter which persists 

because there is insufficient or inappropriate soil fauna and microbiota to decompose it properly.  

Considering that plant communities are dynamic through time, evaluation of recovery of ecosystems 

after removal of invasive plants requires median to long-term monitoring. However, most of these 

types of studies have been too short to provide comprehensive results (Maron &amp;amp; Jefferies, 2001; 

Berlow, D'Antonio &amp;amp; Swartz, 2003; Ogden &amp;amp; Rejmánek, 2005; Hejda &amp;amp; Pyšek, 2006). Furthermore, 

studies which consider duration of invasion prior to clearing are very scarce (Strayer et al., 2006). 

Against this background, we carried out a study to evaluate the resurgence of native and exotic plant 

species over a six year period in a coastal dune ecosystem dominated by A. longifolia for different 

durations, predicting that the resilience of communities of native species will decrease as invasion 

time increases and that removal of litter along with the invasive plants will facilitate recovery of native 

plant communities. The experimental set up was established in order to test management solutions 

and offer concrete recommendation to managers dealing with invasive species. 

METHODOLOGY 

Study site - The study area was located in the São Jacinto Dunes Nature Reserve (hereafter 

SJDNR) which is located on the central-northern coast of Portugal (40º 39’ N, 8º 44’ W). SJDNR 

covers about 660 ha and is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the West and by the Ria de Aveiro 

estuary to the East. The climate is Mediterranean with Atlantic influence. The mean annual 



 

121 

precipitation is 920 mm and mean monthly temperatures range from 10.2ºC in January to 20.2ºC in 

June. Dominant winds blow from the Northwest and North, approaching from the Ocean. Historically, 

the area supported open vegetation characterized by several communities dominated by shrub and 

herb species and sporadic small trees (Neto, 1993; Honrado et al., 2006).  

Acacia longifolia, which was introduced into SJDNR early in the 20th century to curb movement of 

sand, has subsequently proliferated and extensively invaded much of the reserve (Marchante et al., 

2008b). When this study took place, A. longifolia was dominant over 150 ha and occurred in mixed 

association with other plant species over 200 ha (Guimarães, 2004). Other exotic species such as 

Carpobrotus edulis and Cortaderia selloana were also invasive in the area but to a lesser extent. The 

invaded portions of SJDNR can be divided into long-invaded and recently invaded areas. Long-

invaded areas have had A. longifolia for several decades and are largely restricted to a small portion 

along the South border of the SJDNR. The recently invaded areas came about when A. longifolia 

proliferated over a large (previously-unaffected) area of the reserve after a natural fire which 

destroyed about 200 ha of vegetation, including pine plantations, during the 1995 summer (Silva, 

1997). Before the fire, the burnt areas had low numbers of A. longifolia plants, mostly in the under-

story of Pinus pinaster Aiton. The mono-specific, arboreal stands of A. longifolia had caused 

significant changes in community structure (Marchante et al. 2003) and ecosystem functioning 

(Marchante et al. 2008b, 2008c), including deposition of large quantities of leaf litter (Marchante et 

al., 2008b), reduction of light at soil level and replacement of diverse herbaceous and shrubs 

communities (Neto, 1993; Honrado et al., 2006; chapter 2). 

Experimental design - In each of the two invaded areas (long and recently invaded), a complete 

randomized block design was used to define five blocks, each consisting of three 100 m2 plots with 

similar A. longifolia cover. One of three treatments was randomly assigned to one plot in each block. 

The treatments were: 1) plots cleared of A. longifolia (abbreviated AR) by cutting the trees with 

chainsaws at ground level; 2) plots where A. longifolia trees were removed and the litter layer was 

also removed (ALR); and 3) plots with both A. longifolia and litter left intact as untreated controls (A). 

After treatments had been applied according to the experimental design, conditions in cleared plots 

(AR and ALR) were distinctly different from untreated plots (A) (Table 5.1). 

After trees and litter were removed in October 2002, two 2 x 10 m transects were demarcated to 

record plant species growing in each plot. Transects were monitored twice a year (late January/early 

February and May), from December 2002 to May 2004, and then once every 2 years until May 2008. 

Parameters measured were: 1) plant species present, 2) species cover, 3) number of A. longifolia 

seedlings and 4) soil litter coverage.

Data analysis - Recovery of plant communities post-clearing: recovery of communities was first 

characterized using measures of species richness, plant cover, Shannon diversity and evenness 

separately. Because A. longifolia was the potential driver of change in the plant community, it was 

excluded from the analysis of species richness and total plant cover. Pielou evenness index J (from 

0 to 1) and Shannon diversity index H’ (from 0 to ? 5, but usually found to fall between 1.5 and 3.5) 

calculations included A. longifolia as these indexes reflect the presence of a dominant species 

(Magurran, 1988). All parameters were analyzed by repeated-measures MANOVA with time post- 

clearing as a within subject factor and invasion status and treatment as between-groups factors. 

Species traits and turnover rate in plant communities post-clearing: the species were categorized 

into biological and ecological attributes which were classified under traits (Table 5.2).

1 = Field observations; 2 = Franco &amp;amp; Afonso (1971-2003); 3 = Marchante, Freitas &amp;amp; Marchante (2008). 

* In species with more than one attribute, the attribute dominant in the studied system was considered. 

 

 For each treatment, the area covered by species with a particular attribute was summed and divided 



 

123 

by the total area covered by all the species within the trait, to produce a relative abundance of each 

attribute per treatment. Acacia longifolia was treated separately. 

Species turnover rate (TR) was calculated to measure species shifts between May 2003 and 2008, 

as follows: TR =0.5 (L+G), where L is the number of species lost and G is the species gained during 

a defined period (Hilli, Kuitunen &amp;amp; Suhonen, 2007). Turnover rates differences were analysed with a 

2-way factorial ANOVA. The time interval represents the changes observed in the full study period, 

with measurement made each year in the same season being compared to avoid seasonal effects as 

a source of discrepancy. 

Susceptibility to (re)invasion post-clearing was based on: a) number of A. longifolia seedlings; and b) 

A. longifolia cover (saplings and trees), which were analyzed by repeated-measures MANOVA with 

time post-clearing as a within subject factor and invasion status and treatment as between-groups 

factors. 

In all statistical analyses, mean differences were separated with LSD test at 5% level of significance. 

STATISTICA 6.0 (StatSoft, Inc., 2001, http://www.statsoft.com) was used. 

RESULTS 

Recovery of plant communities post-clearing Over the six year monitoring period, 83 species 

of vascular plants in 26 families were identified in the survey plots; six were exotics and 77 natives. 

There were 77 species in recently invaded areas as opposed to 56 species in long-invaded areas. 

More species were found in plots where both A. longifolia and litter were removed (ALR) (74 species 

and 49 species in recently- and long-invaded plots, respectively) than in cleared areas where only 

A. longifolia was removed (AR) (64 species and 48 species in recently- and long-invaded plots, 

respectively). In untreated areas (A) there were approximately half as many species (36 species and 

26 species in recently- and long-invaded plots, respectively) as in the cleared areas (Appendix 5.1). 

A significant interaction between invasion age, clearing treatments and time post-clearing for species 

cover (F12, 60 = 10.82, P &amp;lt;0.0001) and species richness (F12, 60 = 2.67, P = 0.006) was verified. In the 

first two months after clearing, neither plant cover (Figure 5.1) nor species richness (Figure 5.2) 

showed clear patterns of change, with some exceptions, e.g. by December 2002, in plots in recently 

invaded areas where only A. longifolia had been removed (AR), species richness was higher than in 

all the other plots. There was a significant increase of species cover (Figure 5.1) and richness 

(Figure 5.2) in both cleared plots (AR and ALR), that ranged from ca. 20% cover and four species 



 

124 

immediately after clearing, to more than 80% cover and 12 species by May 2006. Generally, in 

untreated plots (A) plant cover was sparser and species richness was lower than in cleared plots (AR 

and ALR) of both invaded areas; both of these parameters showed little change over time.

Figure 5.1 Changes in plant cover (mean +SE; n = 10) over time after clearing treatments in areas long-
invaded and recently invaded by Acacia longifolia: AR - A. longifolia removed, ALR - both A. longifolia and 
litter layer removed, and A - A. longifolia maintained. Different letters above bars indicate statistically 
significant differences at P &amp;lt;0.05 (LSD test). Values do not include A. longifolia cover. 

Plant cover was lower in long-invaded areas compared to recently invaded areas. With time, plant 

cover in plots where the litter layer was removed (ALR) became significantly higher than in plots 

where the litter layer was left intact (AR). On the last sampling occasion there was a significant 

reduction in plant cover (Figure 5.1).

Figure 5.2 Changes in species richness (mean +SE; n = 10) over time after clearing treatments in areas 
long-invaded and recently invaded by Acacia longifolia. Different letters above bars indicate statistically 
significant differences at P &amp;lt;0.05 (LSD test). Values do not include A. longifolia. Abbreviations as for 
Figure 5.1. 

After clearing, regardless of litter removal (ALR) or not (AR), less species appeared in long-invaded 

areas (12-14 species/plot) than in recently invaded areas (16-18 species/plot) (Figure 5.2). In long-

invaded areas, species richness was higher in plots where the litter was removed (ALR) than in plots 



 

125 

where it was left (AR). In recently invaded areas the species richness in the plots was generally 

similar under the two clearing treatments. 

Shannon’s diversity and Pielou’s evenness were significantly lower in untreated plots (A) than in 

cleared plots regardless of litter being removed (ALR) or not (AR) (Figure 5.3). By May 2003, both 

Shannon diversity and evenness of untreated plots (A) were significantly higher in recently invaded 

areas than in long-invaded areas. Five years later there was no difference. Soon after clearing (May 

2003) plant diversity was lower in plots where A. longifolia was removed alone (AR) than in plots 

where the plants and litter were removed (ALR) (Figure 5.3a), but five years latter diversity had 

significantly decreased in ALR and become similar to AR. Evenness was similar between treatments, 

and in general decreased with time (Figure 5.3b)

Figure 5.3 Diversity measures over time after clearing treatments in areas long- and recently invaded by 
Acacia longifolia. (a) Shannon Diversity and (b) Pielou’s Evenness. Different letters in the lines indicate 
statistically significant differences at P &amp;lt;0.05 (LSD test). Indexes were calculated with A. longifolia included. 
Abbreviations as for Figure 5.1. 

Species traits and turnover rate in plant communities after clearing. Analyses of species traits 

showed more changes in cleared plots (AR and ALR) than in untreated plots (A) (Figure 5.4). In the 

early stages of recovery, therophytes were predominant in cleared plots. Although their relative 

abundance declined with time, they remained the most abundant group in all the plots except those 

without litter (ALR) in long-invaded areas where nanophanerophytes became dominant 

(Figure 5.4a). The proportions of chamaephytes, nanophanerophytes and A. longifolia increased with 

time. Several life forms were absent, or rare (relative abundance less than 1%), in untreated plots (A) 

of recently- and long-invaded areas. 

The majority of species that appeared in cleared plots were natives (Figure 5.4b) accounting for over 

70% of the cover. In untreated plots (A) A. longifolia dominated without any major changes over time, 

while in cleared plots it increased continuously.

Figure 5.4 Differences in relative abundance of species traits among invasion age and treatments, in May 
2003, 2006 and 2008. The species were categorized according to (a) a biological trait: Raunkiær life forms, 
and (b) an ecological trait: species biogeographic distribution. Abbreviations as for Figure 5.1. 

The most abundant species in all of the cleared plots were generalists, including species associated 

with both dunes and other sandy habitats (dune/generalists) as well as others associated with a 

wider range of habitats (generalist). In the early phase of recovery, the wide-ranging generalist 

species were prevalent but decreased with time, while dune/ generalists increased with time, 

especially in long-invaded areas. Several exotic, invasive species were detected in cleared plots of 

both areas by May 2003, their abundance increasing proportionately with time in recently invaded 

areas, especially in cleared plots without litter (ALR). The relative abundance of species typical from 

dunes was highest in cleared plots of long-invaded areas, particularly when only A. longifolia was 

removed (AR). 

Species turnover was affected by invasion time (F 1, 54 = 9.99, P = 0.003) and clearing treatments 

(F 2, 54 = 24.26, P &amp;lt;0.001) with no interaction between factors (F 2, 54 = 0.89, P = 0.418). In the 5 year 

interval following clearing, recently invaded areas showed significantly (p = 0.003) more alteration of

species (TR = 5.5 ± 0.5) than long-invaded areas (TR = 3.9 ± 0.4). Species turnover was much 

higher in cleared areas (AR = 5.7 ± 0.6 and ALR = 6.1 ± 0.4) than in untreated ones (A = 2.2 ± 0.3) 

(A vs. AR and A vs. ALR, p &amp;lt;0.001). Litter removal did not significantly affect species turnover (AR 

vs. ALR, p = 0.522). 

Susceptibility to (re)invasion post-clearing. There was a significant interaction between 

invasion age, clearing treatments and time after clearing with respect to reinvasion after clearing, 

based on both the total number of A. longifolia seedlings (F 12, 60 = 15.31, P &amp;lt;0.0001) and numbers 

that survived to become saplings and trees (F 12, 60 = 2.08, P = 0.032). Counts of A. longifolia 

seedlings revealed that a high number of viable seeds had accumulated in the soil, with particularly 

high peaks of germination in cleared plots (both AR and ALR) of long-invaded areas (Figure 5.5). 

Germination of A. longifolia seedlings was heterogeneous (e.g., ranged from 4 to 165 seedlings m-2 

in ALR plots of long-invaded areas, in January 2004). Six years after clearing there were still seeds 

germinating. Many of the seedlings did not survive from one monitoring period to the next but 

throughout the study new seedlings were found on every sampling occasion including the last.

Figure 5.5 Germination of Acacia longifolia seedlings (mean + SE m-2; n = 10) over time in long-invaded and 
recently invaded areas after clearing treatments. Different letters above bars indicate statistically significant 
differences at P &amp;lt;0.05 (LSD test). Abbreviations as for Figure 5.1. 

On average, cover of A. longifolia in untreated plots (A) was 10% higher in long-invaded areas than 

in recently invaded areas (Figure 5.6). The successful reinvasion by A. longifolia (recorded as 

seedlings that grow to saplings and trees) occurred progressively. By May 2008 there was a 

significant increase of the invasive species cover in all cleared plots (AR and ALR). About 6 years 

after clearing, there was a higher cover of A. longifolia in cleared plots where litter had been left (AR) 

than in plots where litter was removed (ALR).

invaded and recently invaded areas after clearing treatments. Different letters above bars indicate statistically 
significant differences at P &amp;lt;0.05 (LSD test). Abbreviations as for Figure 5.1. 

DISCUSSION  

How resilient are dune plant communities after invasion for short and long periods?  

Acacia longifolia is clearly a transformer (sensu Richardson et al. (2000)) converting diverse native 

areas into species poor, unrecognizable landscapes with several attributes of both biotic and abiotic 

components altered (Marchante, Marchante &amp;amp; Freitas, 2003; Marchante et al., 2008a, b). This study 

showed that despite the severe impacts, the removal of almost mono-specific stands of an invader 

may result in a progressive increase in native species richness, plant cover and life forms revealing 

inherent resilience within the system. However, as the invasion period extends, the areas become 

less resilient mainly due to incremental loss of native species. The finding that native species 

noticeably dominate after clearing, in all situations, suggests that degradation thresholds had not yet 

been crossed (Aronson et al., 1993; King &amp;amp; Hobbs, 2006) and autogenic recovery occurred to a 

certain extent with continuous improvement in several ecosystem attributes. 

After clearing off the invader, soil microbiology and chemistry (Marchante et al., 2009), light and litter 

layer conditions, native seed-bank (chapter 4; Marchante, Freitas &amp;amp; Hoffmann, 2010b) and several 

components of plant communities seemed to slowly recover until they more-closely resembled the 

preinvasion situation (chapter 2). Although most of the recovering species were generalists, there 

were also several species characteristic of dunes in the mix, e.g. Corema album (L.) Don, Iberis 

procumbens Lange subsp. procumbens and Pseudorlaya minuscule (Font Quer) Laíz (see Appendix 

5.1 for more), species which are relevant for conservation, not only because some are endemic but 

also because are components of the original communities. Nevertheless, six years after clearing 

many species characteristic of dunes were still missing, resulting in communities that were not fully

representative of the characteristic species assemblages and indicating that dune communities take 

a long time to return to their initial states, if ever.  

Decreased resilience with invasion time occurred similarly in South African ‘fynbos’ invaded by other 

Acacia species, although species characteristic of the original ecosystem were apparently better 

represented (Holmes &amp;amp; Cowling, 1997b). Conversely, other post-clearing studies have shown higher 

abundance of exotic species than natives (Ogden &amp;amp; Rejmánek, 2005; Hulme &amp;amp; Bremner, 2006) and 

no cumulative increase in species richness with time (Maron &amp;amp; Jefferies, 2001). In fact, the seed-

banks of SJDNR had higher abundance of exotic short-lived species (chapter 4; Marchante, Freitas 

&amp;amp; Hoffmann, 2010b) than is apparent in this field study; this is most likely a mismatch because the 

few exotics that were abundant as seeds were not able to provide a persistently high cover in the 

field. 

The higher species turnover of recently invaded areas was possibly related to the higher variability of 

species in the seed banks with probable dependence on different stimuli for germination which was 

consequently staggered. Soils of recently invaded areas also had lower nutrient content (Marchante 

et al., 2008b), a condition which is associated with higher species turnover rates (Warren et al. 

2009).  

The recovery process was very dynamic and 6 years after clearing some shifts in species and 

patterns were obvious, e.g., the area covered by the native shrubs Cistus salvifolius L. and Cytisus 

grandiflorus (Brot.) DC. (endemic to Iberian Peninsula) and the invader itself, increased substantially. 

This was accompanied by a reduction in total plant cover (excluding A. longifolia) and diversity due 

to a substantial decline of some generalist, early coloniser species, mainly Poaceae but also 

Asteraceae (Appendix 5.1), which were especially abundant in plots soon after clearing. Some 

changes observed during recovery would have been missed in a shorter study, corroborating that 

studies post-clearing of invasive plants should continue for extended periods than most analogous 

studies (Holmes &amp;amp; Cowling, 1997b; Ogden &amp;amp; Rejmánek, 2005; Hejda &amp;amp; Pyšek, 2006).  

Is this system susceptible to (re)invasion after clearing? 

Regrowth from cut stumps was negligible in the cleared plots, though clearing in other areas of 

SJDNR resulted in high levels of resprouting (Marchante, Marchante &amp;amp; Freitas, 2004). The 

abundance of A. longifolia seedlings, particularly in long-invaded cleared plots, made cleared areas 

susceptible to reinvasion. The densities of seedlings were much lower than the densities of seeds in 

the soil (chapter 3; Marchante, Freitas &amp;amp; Hoffmann, 2010c) probably due to the absence of fire which 

stimulates germination (Pieterse &amp;amp; Cairns, 1986). 



 

130 

Most A. longifolia seedlings failed to survive to saplings, confirming that estimates of reinvasion 

potential should be based on established plants instead of seedlings (Galatowitsch &amp;amp; Richardson, 

2005). The successful reinvasion by A. longifolia was highest on cleared plots where litter (mainly 

composed of A. longifolia abscised phyllodes) remained and consequently retained seeds and 

elevated soil nutrients (Marchante et al., 2008b). This positive feed-back, where the invader creates 

conditions that favour itself, has been noted by Milton (1981) and by Ehrenfeld et al (2003). 

The cover of Carpobrotus edulis, another aggressive invader, also increased after A. longifolia 

removal, particularly in recently invaded areas, thereby representing an additional impediment to 

native recovery. Being a species with vegetative reproduction (Roiloa et al., 2009), the clearing 

operations probably fragmented C. edulis plants and favoured its spread. Other exotics 

(Gamochaeta pensylvanica (Willd.) Cabrera, Conyza spp. and Cortaderia selloana) were also found 

in the cleared areas. Disturbance caused by clearing operations frequently promotes reinvasion by 

the target species, or by other alien species (Hobbs &amp;amp; Huenneke, 1992; Luken, Kuddes &amp;amp; 

Tholemeier, 1997; D'Antonio &amp;amp; Meyerson, 2002; Dodson &amp;amp; Fiedler, 2006), emphasizing the need for 

follow up control (Campbell, 2000; Galatowitsch &amp;amp; Richardson, 2005). 

What are the implications of this study for dune ecosystems’ management? 

 In systems where invasions are vast, persistent and include a substantial seed bank of the invader, 

such as A. longifolia in the Portuguese dune ecosystems (Marchante, Marchante &amp;amp; Freitas, 2003; 

chapter 3; Marchante et al., 2008b, a), eradication is an unrealistic goal (Mack &amp;amp; Lonsdale, 2002). 

Control measures aimed at reducing the abundance of the invader to less problematic levels and 

restoring some of the lost structural and functional components of the ecosystem seem feasible, 

despite hardly being able to recreate the historical landscape. The goal should be to prioritize 

invaded areas, based on likelihood of successful restoration and on the conservation value of the 

areas (Wittenberg &amp;amp; Cock, 2005), and then to find the best way to achieve improvement. Our study, 

as others (Holmes &amp;amp; Cowling, 1997b), recommend that recently invaded areas should be prioritized 

for control because recovery of both natural vegetation (this study) and soil parameters (Marchante 

et al., 2009), is likely to be more successful and at less cost. Nonetheless, even in recently invaded 

areas simply removing the invader does not seems to be sufficient to fully restore the system. 

Additional manipulation is required (King &amp;amp; Hobbs, 2006), namely planting desirable species, 

removing the litter and/or depleting the invasive seed bank. 

Species that are characteristic of dunes (e.g., Crucianella maritima L., Artemisia campestre L. subsp. 

maritima Arcangeli, Helichrysum italicum (Roth) G. Don fil. subsp. picardi (Boiss. &amp;amp; Reuter) Franco) 



 

131 

and were recorded as scarce/absent should be sown or transplanted to accelerate recovery, as far 

as is possible according to the species assemblages typical of each dune community. This has been 

successfully achieved in some restoration projects (Hartman &amp;amp; McCarthy, 2004). Transplanting will 

probably be more effective as saplings (cultivated or moved from adjacent dune) will have a height 

advantage over the invasive seedlings (Galatowitsch &amp;amp; Richardson, 2005), even though this 

approach might be limited by a lack of available native dune species ready to transplant. 

The clearing methods may also have implications for the success of restoration (Holmes &amp;amp; Cowling, 

1997b; Holmes et al., 2000). Removing thick litter layers is necessary in systems that are naturally 

litter poor, such as the dunes (Marchante et al., 2008b). This measure hastened the recovery of 

native species (Appendix 5.1) and decreased reinvasion potential, particularly in long-invaded areas 

where there was a more-substantial, slowly-decomposing litter layer (Pereira, Graca &amp;amp; Molles, 1998; 

Marchante, 2008). Conversely, in recently invaded areas most of the seeds (or other propagules) 

that germinated soon after clearing were accumulated in the thinner litter layer and were lost with its 

removal. Lack of seeds in long-invaded litter was probably due to: (i) the disruption of recruitment of 

new seeds (Holmes &amp;amp; Cowling, 1997b, a); (ii) additional loss of seed viability with time; and (iii) 

failure of seedlings to establish (Facelli &amp;amp; Pickett, 1991). As the post-clearing period increased, more 

propagules entered the cleared plots from surrounding areas and the number of species, particularly 

in recently invaded areas, became increasingly similar in both cleared plots. Litter, even more when 

the accumulated layer increases, often suppresses germination and establishment of small seeded 

species (Xiong &amp;amp; Nilsson, 1999; Sayer, 2006) which were frequent in cleared areas. Myrica faya and 

C. album, species typical of dunes, and the invader itself, have relatively large seeds whose 

seedlings survived germination through the deep litter layers. Low-intensity fire could be used to 

clear A. longifolia because it removes the nitrogen-rich litter and scorches seeds thereby depleting 

the seed bank (Holmes &amp;amp; Cowling, 1997b). 

The size of the area that is cleared apparently influences the recovery process, with resurgence of 

A. longifolia less likely and successful recovery more probable when small areas are cleared. 

Subsequently cleared areas may be progressively increased. Under natural conditions smaller gaps 

disappear more rapidly than larger gaps through encroachment of the surrounding vegetation 

(Fenner &amp;amp; Thompson, 2005). Additionally, small scale clearing operations generate lower levels of 

disturbance being less of a stimulus to germination of A. longifolia seeds. Clearing operations over 

several hectares that took place elsewhere in SJDNR resulted in a much higher (sometimes over 

70% A. longifolia cover) and more rapid (less than two years) reinvasion. 

 



 

132 

In conclusion, sand dunes densely invaded by woody species have inherent resilience which 

decreases as invasion time extends. Regardless of time of invasion, autogenic recovery of cleared 

areas can be enhanced by active management actions which maximise, and generate synergy 

between abiotic and biotic components of the system (King &amp;amp; Hobbs, 2006). For example, the initial 

clearing of thickets of the invasive species and the additional removal of the litter layer (practice that 

may be improved if achieved with fire that additionally reduces the invader seed bank) foster abiotic 

changes, e.g., light increase, decrease of barriers to germination and disruption of N addition. Such 

changes will favour desirable, and a few undesirable, species. Subsequent transplantation of missing 

native species can be used to further encourage re-establishment of the natural communities and 

simultaneously reduce subsequent reinvasion (Hulme, 2006). However, encroachment of the invader 

after initial control will be vigorous and needs to be further curtailed. This can be done on a 

sustainable basis by introducing a biological control agent, as Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae, 

which has been successfully used for that purpose in South Africa and is being studied in Portugal 

(Dennill et al., 1999; Marchante, Freitas &amp;amp; Hoffmann, 2010a; chapter 6). The full recovery of 

ecosystems to their original state (both structurally and functionally) may be very long-lasting and 

thus an unrealistic restoration target.

Assessing the suitability and safety of a well-known bud-

galling wasp, Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae, for biological 

control of Acacia longifolia in Portugal 



 

140 

ABSTRACT 

Acacia longifolia is a widespread invasive plant species in Portugal. In South Africa, its spread was 

controlled by a bud-galling wasp, Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae, a strategy that could also be 

applied in Portugal. Biological control of invasive alien plants has received little consideration 

anywhere in Europe and has never been attempted in Portugal. The lack of a suitably-large 

quarantine facility necessitated the use of a novel approach to test non-target species in Portugal. 

With authorization from the Institute for Conservation of Nature and Biodiversity (ICNB), mature 

T. acaciaelongifoliae galls were shipped to Portugal from South Africa to obtain adult female wasps, 

which were then confined in Petri dishes each with a bud-bearing branch of one of 40 non-target 

plant species. The time spent by the wasps exploring and probing the buds was measured and after 

that buds were dissected to detect any egg deposition. Species where eggs were found were then 

submitted to additional tests. The results showed that T. acaciaelongifoliae did not respond to the 

buds of most (23) species. The females spent time on the buds of the other 17 species but only laid 

eggs in three species besides A. longifolia. Oviposition on A. melanoxylon was expected but it was 

not anticipated on vines, Vitis vinifera, (where eggs were deposited externally in the pubescent coat 

of the buds) or on broom, Cytisus striatus, (where eggs were inserted into the buds the same way 

they are on A. longifolia). Paired-choice with these three non-target species showed that no eggs 

were laid on V. vinifera and that less than two eggs/branch, on average, were laid on C. striatus and 

A. melanoxylon. Subsequent trials on potted plants showed that galls only developed on A. longifolia. 

Field surveys in South Africa and Australia showed that galls never occur on either vines or broom. 

The implications of these findings for biological control of A. longifolia in Portugal with 

T. acaciaelongifoliae are considered in relation to the wealth of experience and knowledge about the 

specificity of the wasp and the reliability of conducting host-specificity tests under confined conditions 

of cages. A brief overview of the legal procedures needed to secure the release of 

T. acaciaelongifoliae in Portugal is also presented.

INTRODUCTION 

Acacia longifolia (Andrews) Willd. (Sydney golden wattle, long-leaved wattle) is a small leguminous 

tree or shrub, native to south-eastern Australia, which is invasive both in Portugal (Marchante, 2001; 



 

141 

Marchante, Marchante &amp;amp; Freitas, 2003) and South Africa (Dennill et al., 1999), as well as other 

regions of the globe (Elorza, Sánchez &amp;amp; Vesperinas, 2004). Some authors (Whibley, 1980) 

recognize two subspecies within this taxon: A. longifolia (Andrews) Willd. subsp. longifolia and 

A. longifolia (Andrews) Willd. subsp. sophorae (Labill.) Court., while others treat A. longifolia and 

A. sophorae (Labill.) R. Br. as distinct species (Paiva, 1999). Acacia floribunda (Vent.) Willd is 

closely related to A. longifolia, being considered in the past as a subspecies of A. longifolia (Maslin, 

2001). 

Acacia longifolia was first introduced to Portugal in the late 19th century to curb sand erosion along 

coastal dunes (Neto, 1993). Since then A. longifolia has spread into other areas, both naturally and 

by horticulturists who favor its bright yellow flowers (Almeida, 1999; Kull et al., submitted). It grows 

rapidly and has prolific production of seeds which accumulate in the soil, reaching average levels of 

1500 seeds.m-2 (chapter 3; Marchante, Freitas &amp;amp; Hoffmann, 2010b).The seeds respond to fire and 

germinate en masse in the ash beds (Pieterse &amp;amp; Cairns, 1988). With time, extensive thickets have 

formed in coastal sand dunes and a variety of other habitats, particularly along rivers, road edges 

and on mountain slopes (Marchante, Freitas &amp;amp; Marchante, 2008). Acacia longifolia is legally 

considered as an invasive species in Portugal (Ministério do Ambiente, 1999). Its ability to fix 

nitrogen (Rodríguez-Echeverría, Crisóstomo &amp;amp; Freitas, 2007), and the absence of natural enemies, 

contribute to making A. longifolia a highly competitive species capable of shading out native species 

(Marchante, Marchante &amp;amp; Freitas, 2003) and posing a substantial threat to local biodiversity 

(Marchante, 2001) while changing soil properties and altering ecosystem processes (chapter 3; 

Marchante et al., 2008b, a, 2009). 

In Portugal, control of A. longifolia relies on mechanical methods, mainly basal cutting and, to a less 

extent, on chemical application of herbicide to the cut ends of the stumps. These methods are 

prohibitively expensive and have failed to achieve lasting control (Marchante, Marchante &amp;amp; Freitas, 

2004), mostly due to replenishment of thickets from the abundant seed banks in the soil (Marchante, 

Freitas &amp;amp; Hoffmann, 2010a). 

In South Africa, where A. longifolia had been problematic for over a hundred years, biological control 

with an Australian gall wasp, Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae Froggatt (Hymenoptera: 

Pteromalidae), later assisted by a seed-feeding weevil Melanterius ventralis Lea (Coleoptera: 

Curculionidae), has proven to be an excellent management option (Dennill, 1988; Impson &amp;amp; Moran, 

2003) which is not yet available in Portugal.  

The first T. acaciaelongifoliae individuals introduced to South Africa, during 1982, were collected in 

Australia from its two known, closely-related hosts, A. longifolia and A. floribunda (Dennill, 1987). 



 

142 

Soon after release, it became clear that besides having a direct effect on seed production (Dennill, 

1990; Dennill et al., 1999), T. acaciaelongifoliae galls also act as nutrient sinks and thereby indirectly 

inhibit the development of both reproductive and vegetative growth of their host plants, often causing 

die back of branches and whole plants when environmental conditions are harsh (Dennill, 1985; 

Impson &amp;amp; Moran, 2003). There have been no quantitative surveys to demonstrate the overall 

effectiveness of the wasp as a biocontrol agent (Hoffmann et al., 2002) but A. longifolia is generally 

no longer considered to be anywhere near as problematic as it was formerly, a change that is 

attributed to biological control having succeeded in South Africa. 

Recently, consideration has been given to using T. acaciaelongifoliae in Portugal for biological 

control of A. longifolia. The prospects of success are good because the wasp has a proven track 

record and because it is highly host specific. The specificity of T. acaciaelongifoliae was confirmed 

before it was released in South Africa by exposing potted plants to the insects under caged 

quarantine conditions and subsequently seeking signs of gall development in non-target plants (Van 

den Berg, 1980; Dennill, Donnelly &amp;amp; Chown, 1993). Since its release, T. acaciaelongifoliae only 

utilizes two of its known Australian host plants, A. longifolia and A. floribunda (Dennill &amp;amp; Donnelly, 

1991; McGeoch &amp;amp; Wossler, 2000). Underdeveloped galls are very rarely seen on Paraserianthes 

lophantha (Willd.) Nielsen and Acacia melanoxylon R. Br. in South Africa, but only when these plants 

occur in close proximity to heavily galled A. longifolia plants and neither of the two species is 

considered to be a suitable host for the wasp (Dennill, Donnelly &amp;amp; Chown, 1993). The host specificity 

of T. acaciaelongifoliae is not unexpected because insects that attack and live within the 

reproductive parts of their host plant (especially gall-forming insects) almost always display a high 

degree of monophagy (Ananthakrishnan, 1984).  

Although classical biological control has been used against insect pests in Europe (EPPO, 2008), to 

date only one biological control agent (the psyllid, Aphalara itadori Shinji) has been approved to 

release against an alien invasive plant (Fallopia japonica (Houtt) R. Decr.), which occurred in 2010 

(Sheppard, Shaw &amp;amp; Sforza, 2006; Shaw, Bryner &amp;amp; Tanner, 2009; EPPO, 2010). Despite the 

unequivocal body of evidence that T. acaciaelongifoliae is highly host specific (Dennill, Donnelly &amp;amp; 

Chown, 1993), due to the novelty of the process in Europe, regulatory authorities in Portugal insisted 

that additional evidence should be obtained to confirm that T. acaciaelongifoliae will not inflict any 

damage on non-target hosts, noting that the insects would encounter a distinctive suite of plants in a 

different hemisphere.  

The lack of a suitably-large quarantine facility to perform host specificity tests in potted plants 

presented a challenge in determining how the wasps would respond to the plant species on the list 



 

143 

that was drawn up. This chapter describes the methods that were used, the results that were 

obtained and the implications of the findings for deciding whether or not T. acaciaelongifoliae should 

be cleared for release in Portugal. An overview of the legal procedures needed to secure the release 

of T. acaciaelongifoliae in Portugal is also presented. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Biology of agent and host plant - The biology of T. acaciaelongifoliae has been described by 

Noble (1940) and Dennill (1985; 1987). It is a small (ca. 3mm in length), parthenogenic, univoltine 

bud-galling wasp that deposits its eggs within the tissues of both reproductive and vegetative buds of 

A. longifolia thereby inducing galls which prevent flowering and curb branch growth (Dennill, 1985). 

In the southern hemisphere (including both the native range in Australia and the exotic range in 

South Africa), T. acaciaelongifoliae adults emerge predominantly in spring and early summer 

(October to December/January) and immediately commence oviposition (Dennill, 1987) (Figure 6.1). 

A small proportion of adults emerge at other times of the year (N. Dorchin, personal communication). 

The females live for only 2 - 3 days, do not feed and spend most of their time searching for suitable 

buds on which to lay their eggs. Adult females are highly fecund (409 eggs/female in average) and 

disperse readily.

A. longifolia, in Southern (South H.) and Northern (North H.) Hemisphere. Pictures illustrate the average time 
of occurrence of each phenophase although delays and advances are usually present both within and 
amongst populations of different localities. 

The galls develop during spring (late July to beginning of October, in South Hemisphere, when 

A. longifolia flowers), in the axils of the phyllodes of A. longifolia. At this stage they are mostly green 

and spherical (1-4mm in diameter) (Figure 6.1), being single (one chamber) or in clusters (multi-



 

144 

chambered). As the galls mature they increase in size and by December they are fully developed 

reddish green in colour. Once the wasps emerge galls desiccate, shrivel and turn brown. Galls 

typically contain between 1 and 7 chambers (with up to 24 chambers possible), depending on the 

number of eggs originally laid in the bud. The eggs lie dormant until late winter when they hatch and 

multilocular galls start to develop. Each larva has a discrete chamber in which it completes its 

development. Most chambers contain females but occasional males develop in smaller chambers on 

the periphery of the gall. The sex ratio of females per male averages 5.3:1 (Dennill, 1987). 

Milton and Moll (1982) studied the phenology of A. longifolia in South Africa and showed that while 

the timing of events varies with habitat and location, there is active vegetative growth on the plants 

from September to December (spring and early summer) and then again in autumn (April-May). The 

flower buds are set as the new growth forms but flowers only develop between August and 

November after a period of bud dormancy in winter. Pods develop from September to November and 

are fully ripe by mid-November. The period when young buds are suitable for T. acaciaelongifoliae 

oviposition overlaps with the period when galls are maturing and pods are ripening. In Portugal, the 

phenology of A. longifolia also varies in the different regions where the plants occur and shows some 

seasonal differences to the southern hemisphere (M. Morais, unpublished data). Usually, first flowers 

are observed in December but full bloom is in February - March (late winter through to the beginning 

of spring). Pods develop from March to July and ripen between June and August. Small buds         

(1-3 mm) dominate in June-August but are still present in lower numbers until December. Vegetative 

growth occurs predominantly from April to August (spring and summer) (Morais &amp;amp; Freitas, 2008). 

Trees in more northern regions show a slightly delayed cycle. 

Specificity test plant list - The plant species to be included in non-choice tests were selected 

according to criteria outlined by Briese (2002) and Briese and Walker (2002), including phylogenetic 

proximity and morphological similarity (specifically bud structure) to A. longifolia. Other factors 

considered were: economic value, conservation importance (e.g. endemic species), and 

biogeographic and ecological overlap (i.e. plants that are common in sand dunes, the habitat most 

frequently invaded by A. longifolia). The selection included 40 species (Table 6.1) that fulfilled either 

one (e.g. Quercus faginea Lam.) or several (e.g. Stauracanthus genistoides (Brot.) Samp.) of the 

selection criteria. The final plant list was approved independently by ICNB (Portuguese Institute for 

Nature &amp;amp; Biodiversity Conservation), who had nominated some of the species on the list. The degree 

of phylogenetic separation between the listed plants and A. longifolia was established following Judd 

et al. (1999), mainly to determine higher level of phylogeny (families, orders and major clades).

Congeneric species were not included in the test list, with the exception of A. melanoxylon, because: 

a) there are no congeneric native species (or any other Mimosoideae) in Portugal or elsewhere in 

Western Europe; b) none of the introduced Acacia spp. has major economic value in Portugal; and c) 

several Acacia species (A. baileyana F. Muell.; A. cyclops A.Cunn. ex G.Don; A. dealbata Link; 

A. decurrens (J.C. Wendl.) Willd.; A. floribunda (Vent.) Willd; A. mearnsii De Wild; A. melanoxylon 

and A. saligna (Labill.) H.L. Wendl.) were subjected to host specificity tests in South Africa where 

galls only developed on A. floribunda, a recognized host plant of T. acaciaelongifoliae in its native 

range, besides A. longifolia. Acacia melanoxylon was included in the tests to confirm the status of 

infrequent observations of sporadic gall formation on this plant species in South Africa. 

The test species were separated into six categories on the basis of their phenology. The groups 

comprised the target invader A. longifolia, and five clades with increasing phylogenetic distance from 

the target (see Figure 6.3), including: 1) species from the genus Acacia; 2) species from other 

genera within the family Fabaceae; 3) species from other families within the Order Fabales namely 

Polygalaceae; 4) species from more distant related families within the Rosidae (specifically clade 

Eurosids I, which includes the Fabaceae), namely Rosaceae, Salicaceae, Rhamnaceae, Ulmaceae, 

Fagaceae and Myricaceae; and 5) species from distant families outside the Eurosids I. Although 

some authors (Heywood, 1993; Izco et al., 1998) consider the Order Fabales to be monophyletic, 

including Fabaceae alone, others (Judd et al., 1999) recognize three families in the order, based on 

morphological characters and rbcL sequences, with the Polygalaceae being the only family with 

species present in Portugal. 

Three annual species (Vicia faba L., Pisum sativum L. and Phaseolus vulgaris L.) were included on 

the list even though the wasp needs an entire year to complete its development within its gall, a 

mismatch which will preclude this group of plants as possible hosts. The three species where 

included because they belong to the same family as A. longifolia and due to their importance as 

crops. 

Host specificity testing - Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae galls were collected from late 

September to December during 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2010 on the campus of the University of 

Cape Town, South Africa (33º57’S 18º27’E). For shipment, batches of galls were packaged in sealed 

polyester cloth bags inside cardboard containers which were air freighted to Portugal. The packaging 

allowed exchange of respiratory gases while ensuring containment of any insects that emerged in 

transit. The galls were received at Escola Superior Agrária de Coimbra (Portugal), where they were 

kept in a quarantine facility at approximately 25ºC, 12: 12 L: D, conditions which were maintained 

before and during experiments. Acacia longifolia was collected from several localities in Coimbra 



 

147 

(40º20’N, 8º40’W) and S. Jacinto Dunes (40º39’N, 8º44’W). Branches of test plants were collected in 

several locations immediately before initiation of the test and were transported with the cut end of the 

stem in a container of water to prevent wilting. In the laboratory, shoots with small buds had the cut 

end covered with damp tissue paper which was held in place with aluminum foil. 

No-choice tests - The behavior and relative acceptability of all non-target plant species as 

oviposition sites for T. acaciaelongifoliae was assessed in no-choice tests with A. longifolia as a 

control. Each shoot was placed in a Petri dish (5 cm tall, 23 cm diameter) and exposed to one female 

wasp for the duration of its adult life (2 to 3 days). Nine branches were tested per species, each with 

a separate wasp in an individual cage. Whenever possible, each cage contained plants with 

comparable amounts of foliage and numbers of buds (frequently, seven or more buds). Some 

exceptions were inevitable due to distinct plant morphology, namely species with high numbers of 

small buds in close proximity to each other along the shoot (e.g., Erica scoparia L. and Corema 

album (L.) D. Don) or species with buds widely spaced along the shoot (e.g., Ceratonia siliqua L. and 

Pinus pinaster Aiton). 

Paired-choice tests were conducted in November 2010 to evaluate preference by 

T. acaciaelongifoliae females on A. longifolia paired with each of the non-target species where eggs 

were detected in non-choice tests. Tests were conducted in the same Petri dishes as non-choice 

tests, for the duration of the females’ adult life. Nine pairs of branches, of equivalent size, were 

tested per non-target species. 

Observations of the behavior of T. acaciaelongifoliae - Behavior of each wasp was observed 

during nine observation sessions of 1200 s (20 minutes) for each test (including non-choice and 

paired-choice). An observation session commenced when the wasp first moved on to a plant or after 

five minutes if this had not happened by then. Over the five years of the trials there were 131 h of 

observations of the wasps. 

Dissection of buds to detect T. acaciaelongifoliae eggs - After exposure to the female wasps, 

buds of branches used in no-choice and paired-choice tests were characterized according to size 

(&amp;lt;1 mm; 1 mm; 1.5 mm; 2 mm; ? 3 mm). In all the branches, from both no-choice and paired-choice 

tests, buds were dissected under a binocular microscope to determine the number of 

T. acaciaelongifoliae eggs that had been deposited, if any. At least seven buds (exceptionally less in 

species with fewer buds per mm of shoot) were dissected per branch. Eggs of T. acaciaelongifoliae 

are minuscule (approximately 0.2 mm in length), brilliant white and recognizable by their oval to 

oblanceolate shape (Figure 6.2).

Figure 6.2 Acacia longifolia (left) and Vitis vinifera (right) buds dissected to reveal several 
T. acaciaelongifoliae eggs. On A. longifolia buds the eggs were enclosed in bud tissue. On V. vinifera the 
eggs were lodged in the protective layer of pubescence that covers the surface of the bud. 

Gall induction on potted plants - Plant species in which eggs were detected in buds were 

subsequently tested further, except for A. melanoxylon. This species was not included because it 

was particularly difficult to get the small potted plants needed for the experiment and it is already 

known to support gall formation sporadically, i.e., observations in the field in South Africa confirmed 

the result of the oviposition test. For each species, six small (30-90 cm) potted plants were enclosed 

separately in a plastic bag into which two adult T. acaciaelongifoliae females were added and left 

until they died, corresponding to ca. two days of contact. Wasps were transferred to the potted plant 

within 14 h of emergence. Two days after all the wasps had died their remains were removed, the 

plastic bag was detached and the plants were moved outdoors and monitored for six months to 

detect whether or not there was any gall development. Given that the immature stages are 

endopahgous and immobile there was no risk from retaining plants outdoors during this phase of the 

life cycle. The numbers of galls formed, along with their dimensions, were recorded.  

Surveys in South Africa and Australia - When possible, each of the species, or close relatives 

thereof, on which eggs were laid in quarantine was surveyed to determine whether the wasps 

induced galls on these species in South Africa and Australia, in the field. In South Africa, plants were 

surveyed in the Western Cape, Cape Region, where A. longifolia used to be very abundant and still 

exists at somewhat lower levels. Vitis vinifera L. is widely cultivated in the region and A. melanoxylon 

is common but Cytisus striatus (Hill) Rothm is not present at all. Another species of a former Cytisus 

(C. monspessulanus L. = Teline monspessulana (L.) K. Koch.) and the closely related Spartium 

junceum L. (spanish broom) were surveyed for galls. For each plant species, sites were selected 

where the plant species being surveyed was growing in close proximity (&amp;lt;25 m) to A. longifolia 

plants with galls. In Australia, plants were surveyed in New South Wales, Wollongong. Acacia 

1mm 



 

149 

longifolia, A. melanoxylon, T. monspessulana and V. vinifera were all surveyed but only 

A. melanoxylon was found in close proximity to A. longifolia.  

For each sample, 10 plants of the non-target test species and 10 A. longifolia plants were randomly 

selected and observations were made to determine whether the plants had galls by searching for at 

least 15 min. In species where galls were located, 10 branches were randomly selected and the 

terminal 70 cm of each was examined to record the number of T. acaciaelongifoliae galls per branch. 

The observations were made during November (2008 and 2009) and March (2009), when the galls 

were completely formed and easy to detect (both during and after emergence of the adult wasps). 

Statistical analyses - Time spent on each behavioral element was recorded in seconds and mean 

values per species were calculated and compared between species using a General Liner Model 

(GLM), with a between-subject design One-way ANOVA. The bud dissections were used to calculate 

the percentage of both buds and branches with eggs for each plant species. The quantity of eggs per 

branch was also recorded and compared using One-way ANOVA. In paired-choice tests, the One-

way ANOVA was used to compare, separately, results of each pair of species. In no-choice tests, the 

buds were categorized according to size, and the mean number of eggs laid on each bud category 

on each plant species, was compared using a GLM with a between-subject design Factorial ANOVA. 

Differences between means were compared with Tukey’s test at 5% level of significance. When 

needed, data were log transformed to fulfill ANOVA assumptions. STATISTICA 6.0 (StatSoft, Inc. 

2001, www.statsoft.com) was used for the statistical analysis. 

RESULTS 

No-choice tests – observations of the oviposition behavior of T. acaciaelongifoliae 

Behavioral elements did not occur in any particular sequence. Some behavioral elements (“Active on 

plant”, “Off plant” and “Stationary on plant”) were observed on almost all of the plant species that 

were tested (Table 6.2). The wasps were observed exploring the buds of only 17 species (nine 

species had wasps stationary on the buds and 12 species had wasps that were active on the buds), 

with no significant differences between species (Table 6.2). Ovipositional probing was noted on the 

target species A. longifolia and six non-target species, including all the species where eggs were 

later detected. With the exception of A. longifolia, A. melanoxylon and C. striatus, this behavior was 

observed only once on each plant species. 



 

150 

Wasps were observed on the buds for ca. 3% of the total time of observations on all the plants 

(123 h), and spent more time off the plants (ca. 53% of the total time) followed by being stationary on 

the plants (32.5% of the total time). On species where egg deposition was confirmed (Figure 6.3) the 

wasps spent more time on the buds, mainly on buds of A. longifolia, A. melanoxylon and C. striatus.

No-choice tests – dissection of plant species buds to detect T. acaciaelongifoliae eggs 

Dissection of the buds of Erica scoparia, Quercus faginea and Laurus nobilis L., all off the taxonomic 

order Fabales (Figure 6.3), showed that although the wasps had been observed probing the buds of 

these species (Table 6.2), no eggs were laid on any of these plants. Of the nine females placed on 

each plant species, seven laid eggs on the target species, A. longifolia, five laid on A. melanoxylon, 

four on C. striatus and two laid eggs on V. vinifera. Eggs were laid on 21.8% of the buds of 

C. striatus that were exposed to the wasps while on A. melanoxylon only about 10% of buds had 

eggs. On V. vinifera only 4.3% of the buds had eggs whereas on A. longifolia eggs were laid in 

31.8% of the buds. On C. striatus and A. melanoxylon (which were included in the test-list because 

of their close relationship to A. longifolia), eggs were laid within the bud tissues as happens on 

A. longifolia. In the case of V. vinifera eggs were laid on the protective, pubescent outer layer of the 

buds and not within the bud tissues. The number of eggs per branch varied with plant species 

(F 3,32 = 4.182, p = 0.013), with significantly more eggs laid per branch on A. longifolia than on 

V. vinifera and A. melanoxylon while the numbers laid on C. striatus were intermittent between 

A. longifolia and the other two species, and not significantly different from any of the others (Figure 

6.4).

On C. striatus most eggs were found in the smallest buds (&lt;1-1.5 mm) while on V. vinifera the eggs 

were found predominantly on larger buds (1.5 - 2 mm). The target species A. longifolia had eggs in a 

wider range of bud sizes up to 3 mm with uniform pattern of around 30% and 40% of the buds in 

each size class having eggs. On A. melanoxylon the eggs were found mostly in the intermediate 

sized buds (1-2 mm). The pattern of bud use was also reflected in the numbers of eggs which were 

deposited in the different sizes of buds (Figure 6.6). For each of the four plant species, buds 

generally decreased in size from the proximal to the terminal portion of the branches.

The wasps were observed contacting the buds of the non-target species very briefly. For the pair 

A. longifolia - A. melanoxylon the wasps spent significantly more time in A. longifolia whatever the 

behavioral element was. 

Paired-choice tests - dissection of plant buds to detect T. acaciaelongifoliae eggs 

A higher percentage of A. longifolia branches had eggs, reaching 80% in the pair C. striatus, 

A. longifolia, than any of the non-target species where the maximum value was 40% on C. striatus 

(Figure 6.7). When able to choose the target, no wasps selected V. vinifera. A similar trend was 

observed in the quantity of buds with eggs, with fewer buds infected per branch of the non-target 

species than A. longifolia in all paired-choice tests: on average, 11.3% of buds on branches of 

C. striatus had eggs, while on A. melanoxylon only 5.6% of the buds had eggs. On A. longifolia eggs 

were laid in 52.4%, 20.9% and 38.8% of the buds in paired choice tests with C. striatus, 

A. melanoxylon and V. vinifera, respectively. 

Figure 6.7 Percentage of branches of the target and non-target species on paired-choice tests where 
Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae laid eggs.  

In paired-choice oviposition tests, T. acaciaelongifoliae laid significantly more eggs per A. longifolia 

branch than in any of the other three species (Figure 6.8) (V. vinifera F 1,14 = 5.326, p = 0.037, 

C. striatus F 1,16 = 12.355, p = 0.003, A. melanoxylon F 1,14 = 5.423, p = 0.036).  

The pattern of egg distribution relative to bud size was similar to the one observed in no-choice tests, 

with eggs occurring in all sizes of A. longifolia buds (Figure 6.9). Some eggs were detected in larger 

buds than in the no-choice tests. The larger buds on A. longifolia included flower buds with the 

inflorescence spike already clearly developed.

paired-choice tests with three non-target species. 

Gall induction on potted plants 

After exposure to T. acaciaelongifoliae, galls only developed on potted A. longifolia plants. Three of 

the six potted A. longifolia (i.e., 50%) developed galls in low numbers. One plant had three galls 

which were 2, 4 and 6 mm in diameter, and the other two plants had one gall each, which were 7 and 

9 mm in diameter. No galls developed on either of the other two species. Although the plants were 

healthy when presented to the wasps, some perished during the subsequent monitoring period. 

Nevertheless, galls were clearly visible within two months of exposure to the wasps and all of the 

plants survived for that length of time. 

Surveys in South Africa and Australia 

In areas where T. acaciaelongifoliae has open access to the environment, field surveys revealed that 

only A. longifolia had galls of T. acaciaelongifoliae developing on its branches and that galls were 



 

156 

more abundant in South Africa, where the wasp is introduced, than in Australia, the native home of 

the wasps (Figure 6.10).

on five plant species including the target, Acacia longifolia, in South Africa (SA) (Western Cape) and Australia 
(A) (New South Wales). The non-target species included two species (Vitis vinifera and Acacia melanoxylon) 
on which the wasps laid eggs during no-choice tests, and two species closely related to Cytisus striatus 
(T. monspessulana and S. junceum). Non-target species were sampled in SA and A, except for Spartium 
junceum which was only sampled in in SA. 

DISCUSSION 

Even though international regulations are based on risk analysis schemes (EPPO, 2009a), when 

deciding whether to use biological control as part of a management strategy against invasive alien 

plants, the risks of releasing agents must be weighed against the potential costs and benefits, 

including, critically in this case, whether or not suppression of A. longifolia in Portugal would be 

possible and affordable without the intervention of biological control. The impacts of A. longifolia 

invasions on biodiversity and conservation in Portugal are well documented (Marchante et al., 2003, 

2004, 2008a,b, 2009; chapter 2). In addition, management interventions practiced thus far have 

failed in the long term because the invader has resurged from accumulated seed banks (chapter 3; 

Marchante, Freitas &amp;amp; Hoffmann, 2010a) and financial constraints have frequently prevented follow up 

control. Biological control is usually considered as the most cost effective and environmentally-sound 

form of weed control (Holden, Fowler &amp;amp; Schroeder, 1992). Based on precedents in South Africa 

(Dennill &amp;amp; Donnelly, 1991; Dennill et al., 1999), it is highly likely that, were T. acaciaelongifoliae to be 

released in Portugal, it would significantly reduce the invasiveness of A. longifolia.  

What are the chances that T. acaciaelongifoliae will “attack” non-target species? 

In Petri dishes, T. acaciaelongifoliae laid eggs on buds of three non-target plants. On two of these, 

C. striatus and A. melanoxylon (which were included in the test-list because of their close 

phylogenetic relationship to A. longifolia), eggs were laid within the bud tissues as happens on 

A. longifolia. In the case of V. vinifera eggs were only found on three buds and in each case the eggs 



 

157 

were laid on the protective, pubescent outer layer of the buds and not within the bud tissues, i.e., in a 

localization inappropriate to induce the development of the gall.  

Oviposition on A. melanoxylon was no surprise because, besides being a close relative of 

A. longifolia, T. acaciaelongifoliae was observed to probe its buds during host specificity testing in 

South Africa (Van den Berg, 1980). Besides, the species is known to serve, though very infrequently, 

as a ‘subsidiary’ host for T. acaciaelongifoliae in South Africa, in situations where A. melanoxylon 

grows in close proximity to heavily-galled A. longifolia plants (Dennill &amp;amp; Donnelly, 1991). Of the three 

plant species under consideration, the situation with A. melanoxylon is of least concern in the 

exercise of considering the introduction of T. acaciaelongifoliae into Portugal, as it has no economic 

value in Portugal and is currently considered invasive under Portuguese legislation which prohibits 

its use and encourages its control (Ministério do Ambiente, 1999). Galling on this species would not 

be problematic and would most likely be infrequent and sporadic if ever. 

Infliction of damage by T. acaciaelongifoliae on either C. striatus or V. vinifera would not be 

acceptable. Cytisus striatus is a native species in Portugal where it, and several of its congeners, are 

popular ornamental plants while V. vinifera has enormous economic value. Oviposition on these two 

species, and especially V. vinifera, was quite unexpected. A convincing line of evidence that 

T. acaciaelongifoliae will not associate with either of these species under natural conditions in 

Portugal comes from the trials in which no galls developed on potted plants of either C. striatus or V. 

vinifera after exposure to T. acaciaelongifoliae, showing that these species do not meet the 

requirements of the immature stages of the wasps. Additional evidence that V. vinifera will not be 

affected by the wasp comes from paired-choice tests (where V. vinifera was rejected) and from field 

observations; in South Africa where many different cultivars of vines are frequently cultivated in close 

proximity to galled A. longifolia plants no records have ever been made of galls on the vines, either 

historically or during the surveys which constituted part of this study. Similarly, several species of 

Cytisus, and the closely-related Genista, are naturalized in South Africa (Henderson, 1995) and 

Australia (Groves, Boden &amp;amp; Lonsdale, 2005), with some being invasive. They commonly grow in 

areas where A. longifolia occurs. In spite of this prolonged association, no T. acaciaelongifoliae galls 

have ever been reported on any of these plants and no galls were encountered during the field 

surveys that formed part of this study.  

For all the above reasons, the observations of T. acaciaelongifoliae laying eggs on buds of 

V. vinifera and C. striatus in Petri dishes were in every likelihood laboratory artifacts, induced by the 

confined conditions and by the lack of suitable host plant material being available to the females. In 

paired-choice tests, the wasp never laid eggs on V. vinifera, and both the percentage of buds 



 

158 

infected with eggs and the number of eggs per bud on C. striatus were markedly reduced. 

Confinement in cages is well known to disrupt normal behavioral (including olfactory and gustatory) 

responses of herbivorous insects and induces them to develop on a much wider range of plants 

(termed the physiological host range) than they would do naturally (Marohasy, 1998; Heard, 2000; 

Van Klinken, 2000; Withers, Barton Browne &amp;amp; Stanley, 2000; Sheppard, van Klinken &amp;amp; Heard, 2005). 

Such a situation arose during the early stages of the only other biological control program against an 

invasive plant in Europe. In that case, a psyllid, Aphalara itadori, was being considered as a possible 

agent for biological control of Fallopia japonica in the UK (Shaw, Bryner &amp;amp; Tanner, 2009). Despite 

the ambiguous results of laboratory tests, the psyllid was approved for release early in 2010 (Shaw, 

Bryner &amp;amp; Tanner, 2009). Another example, is the oviposition by Evippe sp. (Lepidoptera: 

Gelechidae), in cages, on five non-target species (all within the same family as the target weed) with 

little subsequent larval development (Van Klinken &amp;amp; Heard, 2000). The discrepancy between female 

choice and larval development and survival led Van Klinken and Heard (2000) to conclude that the 

moth would be confined to the target weed in a field situation and should therefore be released as a 

biological control agent.  

Parasitism of galls, unsuitable climate and crossing hemispheres – are there reasons 

to be concerned? 

Besides the need for assurances that T. acaciaelongifoliae will be restricted to A. longifolia, the 

possible acquisition of natural enemies, unsuitable climatic conditions or translocation from the 

southern to the northern hemisphere may potentially limit its effectiveness in Portugal or even 

prevent its establishment altogether. 

 In South Africa, A. longifolia trees are generally more heavily galled than they are in Australia, where 

T. acaciaelongifoliae suffers high levels of parasitism and has to compete with other bud-feeding 

insects (Neser, 1984). This discrepancy persists even though T. acaciaelongifoliae is attacked by 

several native parasitoid species in South Africa (Hill &amp;amp; Hulley, 1995; Manongi &amp;amp; Hoffmann, 1995; 

Seymour &amp;amp; Veldtman, 2010). There is no reason to expect that indigenous hymenopterous 

parasitoids will not utilize the larval and pupal stages of T. acaciaelongifoliae in Portugal (Noyes, 

2003) but, because there are no ecological analogues (i.e., gall forming insects on acacias in 

Portugal), the impact of parasitoids, both directly on the efficacy of T. acaciaelongifoliae (Paynter et 

al., 2010) and indirectly on the local food webs are likely to be trivial. 

In South Africa, T. acaciaelongifoliae is reported to be most effective in warm temperate areas. In 

terms of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system (Kottek et al., 2006), these areas are 



 

159 

grouped as Csb (dry summers) and Cfb (humid summers), with a threshold temperature of &gt; 10ºC 

for at least four months of the year and a mean temperature for the hottest month of ? 22º C; i.e., 

areas that are climatically similar to areas where T. acaciaelongifoliae was originally collected in 

Australia (Cfb) (Dennill, 1987). Most of the Portuguese coastal region (except for the southern 

extremity of the country) and the continental north of Portugal, extending into northwestern Spain is 

classified as Csb (Kottek et al., 2006). In Portugal, A. longifolia is invasive mainly in the coastal 

regions, extending to Galicia, Spain, (Elorza, Sánchez &amp;amp; Vesperinas, 2004), where climatic 

conditions would be favorable for the development and survival of T. acaciaelongifoliae. Thus, there 

should be no concerns that climatic-mismatching would dampen the performance of the wasp, were 

it to be released in Portugal.  

In moving T. acaciaelongifoliae from South Africa to Portugal, consideration needs to be given to the 

asynchronous phenology of the host plant in the southern and northern hemispheres. Female wasps 

moved from South Africa in October/November when the adults are most abundant will be faced with 

host plants in late-autumn stages in Portugal when most of their buds will be larger than the prefered 

size (&gt;2 mm in length) for egg deposition. Although T. acaciaelongifoliae may select some larger 

buds, at that time of year there would also be some smaller buds on the plants which should enable 

the wasps to establish founder populations. Alternatively, lower numbers of T. acaciaelongifoliae 

females could be collected in South Africa earlier in the year (N. Dorchin, personal communication) 

and shipped to Portugal when the A. longifolia plants would be in a more suitable phenological stage. 

Either way, provided enough wasps are released over a sufficiently long period of time, some 

females should oviposit successfully and produce founding and then burgeoning populations of 

adults synchronized with the phenology of A. longifolia in Portugal.  

Should T. acaciaelongifoliae be used as part of a management strategy to control 

A. longifolia in Portugal? 

All indications are that there are no substantive reasons not to release T. acaciaelongifoliae in 

Portugal and thereby alleviate the overwhelming negative impacts of A. longifolia. The extremely 

slight risk that the wasps might lay some eggs on plants other than A. longifolia, the potential indirect 

non-target effects due to parasitoids acquisition, and the minimal consequences thereof, are more 

than offset by the substantial benefits that will accrue if the project succeeds. Biological control is the 

only way to prevent an escalation in levels of irreversible damage that A. longifolia will inevitably 

inflict on the ecology and biodiversity of whole communities of native organisms in Portugal, and 

further afield in Europe.  



 

160 

Further steps to be taken before release…. 

The release of the wasp T. acaciaelongifoliae is the ultimate goal of the research project and 

permissions to do so will have to conform to a series of legal procedures. Any request for release of 

an exotic biocontrol agent against an invasive plant species will be the first in Portugal (and only the 

second in Europe). The regulatory framework to follow is not yet well “established”. Nevertheless, 

considering the framework followed in UK (Djeddour &amp;amp; Shaw, 2010), and which almost certainly will 

have created precedents, the permit to release T. acaciaelongifoliae will have to involve the 

preparation of a pest risk analysis (PRA) as this organism is likely to cause injury to a plant 

(A. longifolia ) within the PRA area. Part of the information needed to the PRA has been gathered 

previously to support the permission to bring the agent into quarantine. Acacia longifolia is 

considered naturalized in Spain, France and Italy, though it is only considered invasive in Spain 

(Elorza, Sánchez &amp;amp; Vesperinas, 2004; Celesti-Grapow et al., 2009). Nevertheless, there are other 

regions in Europe which have Csb or Cfb climates (Kottek et al., 2006), so the potential for the wasp 

to spread across political boarders will need to be addressed in the PRA. PRA will have to be 

included in an application to Portuguese Institute for Conservation of Nature and Biodiversity (ICNB, 

from Ministério do Ambiente e do Ordenamento do Território - MAOT) with the intention to provide 

adequate information for the decision to be made to: 1) free T. acaciaelongifoliae from the 

restrictions of the Decreto-Lei n.º 565/99, under which it is being held, by default once is not listed, 

as a "forbidden non-indigenous species", and 2) to allow its intentional release in the wild. Possibly, 

the application will have to be reviewed by a Standing Committee, as well as by experts. Other 

European Member States (MS), particularly in neighbouring MS and those in the same eco-climatic 

zones should be informed of the intention to release and allowed to comment. 

According to the EPPO decision-support scheme (EPPO, 2009a), the PRA will include a brief 

initiation (stage 1 – Appendix 6.1) and two major sections that aim to perform a risk assessment 

(stage 2 - Appendix 6.2): Section A. categorizes the “pest” and is basically an assessment in the 

form of a binary decision tree, constructed from a sequence of questions based largely on decision 

points; and Section B. aims to assess the probability of introduction and spread and of potential 

economic consequences and is a more detailed assessment that will be performed only if the section 

A leads to the conclusion that the organism has the characteristics of a quarantine pest.  

The risk assessment should lead to a conclusion concerning the level of “risk' presented by the 

agent, that should inform the decision to continue to phase 3 - the Pest Risk Management (Appendix 

6.3) which aims to determine whether the risk is acceptable, and, to identify management options. At 



 

161 

a certain stage, which could be before or during the Pest Risk Management phase, a public 

consultation should take place.  

Only if all the abovementioned stage result in a positive conclusion would a final approval, from 

MAOT be required that will potentially culminate in the agent release. If permission to release is 

granted, contingency and monitoring plans should be in place before release.

General Discussion and Conclusions 

 



 

172 

Despite the profound impacts of A. longifolia invasion on native vegetation (chapter 2), including the 

composition of seed banks (chapter 4, experiment I), plant species recovery observed in the field 

(chapter 5) and in soil seed bank studies (chapter 4, experiment II), showed that the dune systems 

under investigation retained some resilience. Nevertheless, system degradation was striking, 

increasing with time of invasion (chapter 2). Furthermore, invaded systems become highly vulnerable 

to reinvasion even if the existing stands of A. longifolia are removed due to the persistent seed-

banks of A. longifolia (chapter 3). The challenge is to find management options that can be 

sustainable in the long-term. Sustainability is particularly important because funding constraints often 

preclude continuation of management actions. Therefore, biological control by an agent that targets 

the reduction of A. longifolia seed production, and additionally curtails vegetative growth, can be a 

valuable tool for management, and this was shown to be a promising opportunity for Portugal 

(chapter 6). 

WHAT HAS CHANGED ON DUNE PLANT COMMUNITIES DUE TO INVASION BY ACACIA 
LONGIFOLIA? 

Acacia longifolia is clearly a transformer (sensu Richardson et al. (2000)) drastically changing dune 

landscapes. Changes were detected at several different levels: 

• Dune habitat diversity decreased (i.e., the landscape become more homogeneous); plant 

community structure (i.e., physiognomy and vertical stratification) and species traits were markedly 

altered; diversity, richness and cover (of species other than A. longifolia) declined. These extensive 

changes are expected to be reflected in changes to ecological webs and ecosystems services.  

• Soil seed banks, both due to the presence of invader seeds and lack of several native species, 

were altered. 

• Dominance of native plant species post-clearing showed that the system was still resilient, though 

resilience capacity decreased, particularly in long-invaded areas, as shown by the lack of some 

species that are typical of dunes and by the presence of some exotic species (see Box 7.1). 

• Some parameters were more affected than others by duration of invasion, but invasion time really 

made a difference, with the impacts of A. longifolia invasion on plant communities increasing over 

time.  



 

173 

Pristine coastal sand dunes in Portugal are characterized by distinct plant communities/habitats with 

remarkable floristic and phytocoenotic diversity (Honrado et al., 2006; Silva, 2006) of species that 

are naturally adapted to nutrient poor sands and plenty of light at soil level (Smith &amp;amp; Huston, 1989). 

Such communities are becoming increasingly rare with abiotic conditions favourable to their 

development becoming progressively more altered. Changes in vegetation (Marchante, Marchante &amp;amp; 

Freitas, 2003; Kutiel, Cohen &amp;amp; Shoshany, 2004; Hellmann et al., 2010), soil functional microbial 

diversity (Marchante et al., 2008a) and chemical parameters (Marchante et al., 2008b) due to 

invasions have already 

been confirmed for these 

and other Mediterranean 

dunes. 

Most of the findings 

related with vegetation 

were based on studies 

which investigated mode-

rate invasion situations 

and which invariably, as 

far as we know, were 

short-term and limited to 

one invasion period. 

Long-term studies and 

assessments of the 

effects of duration of 

invasion are important 

though scarce in invasion 

ecology (Blossey, 1999; 

Strayer et al., 2006). 

Several parts of the 

present study were long-

term and, while corrobo-

rating some of the earlier 

findings, confirmed the impacts of invasion in areas more-densely inva-ded by A. longifolia. More 

importantly, this investigation showed that duration of invasion is relevant as shown by 1) 

Although the overall results of recovery in the field confirmed the findings of 
seedling emergence, both experiments provided different information and 
complemented each other. Seedling emergence was the only method 
revealing seeds of A. longifolia in non-invaded areas. Even so, it 
apparently augmented the levels of degradation under real field conditions, 
overlooking propagules that migrated from surrounding areas, and missing 
species that failed to germinate under greenhouse conditions. Despite 
such limitations, seedling emergence can be useful for management as it 
allows a quicker assessment of the ecosystem resilience without major 
clearing efforts. Long-term assessments in field experiments gave a more 
detailed insight into the recovery potential, which will probably resemble 
more what will happen after control, but they are more expensive, time-
consuming and take longer to provide answers. There was some 
differences amongst experiments that allowed further conclusions: 

1) Recovery in the field revealed more than twice the number of species 
observed in the seed bank, with differences in traits that were represented. 
This was probably due to some stimuli operating in the field (e.g. passage 
through animal digestive tracts (Calviño-Cancela, 2004), disturbance 
(Grubb, 1988)), but not in the greenhouse. Furthermore, long-term field 
studies allowed succession in the germination of species, as was evident 
from high turnover rates in conjunction with the immigrating propagules 
that colonize the gaps created by clearing (Bullock, 2000).  

2) Ephemeral exotic species dominated the recently invaded seed bank 
while they were sparse in the field. This was most likely a sampling artifact 
(no. of seedling in the seed banks vs.% plant cover in the field) that 
requires cautious interpretation of results, e.g. small short-lived exotics, 
such as Conyza spp., were highly abundant as seeds but that did not 
necessarily translated into a high cover in the field. Carpobrotus edulis and 
A. longifolia required a different analysis. Their seeds were fewer 
(A. longifolia) or scarcely found (C. edulis), particularly in long-invaded 
areas. Nevertheless, having vegetative reproduction, like C. edulis (Roiloa 
et al., 2009), and forming large individuals (A. longifolia is a tree up to 8 m 
and C. edulis forms large mats) one propagule/seed may create high cover 
in the field.

(chapter 5): did these studies reach the same conclusions?

intensification of impacts with time, at vegetation level, 2) impoverishment of seed banks and more 

contamination by the invader seeds in long-invaded areas, and 3) declines in the resilience of the 

system, with autogenic recovery decreasing as the invasion persists. Six years after removal of the 

invader, despite many native species were present, the vegetation did not fully resembled the 

historical plant communities (Neto, 1993) in either long-invaded or recently invaded areas. The 

existing stands were actively expanding and showed potential to continue with seeds found several 

meters from the stands and new invasion foci occurring several hundred meters away; such seeds 

were possibly dispersed by periodic strong winds (Bullock and Clarke, 2000), rodents (Holmes, 

1990), birds (R. Vaz, SJDNR, personal observation), or other agents. Results further showed that 

some changes take years to become measurable, reinforcing the need for long-term studies (see 

Box 7.2), and emphasised that assessment of impacts and recovery potential, including only 

parameters expressed by single-measures, can give incomplete pictures of the changes taking place 

(see Box 7.3).  

When compared with equivalent 

studies on soil Ecology, which looked 

at long-term assessments as well as 

duration of invasion (Marchante et al., 

2008b), this study showed that 

vegetation reacts faster to invasion 

than soil. Vegetation of recently 

invaded areas showed marked 

changes while many soil character-

ristics in the same areas still closely 

resembled native soils. 

Only a few plant species were common to both invaded and non-invaded areas (although seed bank 

similarity amongst areas was somewhat higher, chapter 4), particularly to long-invaded areas, with 

reflection in the plant traits that were dissimilar in the different areas. For example, terophytes and 

generalist species were more abundant in invaded areas, particularly in recently invaded areas, 

probably as a result of propagule immigration after fire (gap formation), while chamaephytes, 

geophytes and hemicryptophytes - to which many species characteristic of dunes belong - were 

almost absent in the understory of these stands and in the seed bank as well. Some natural sand 

dunes lack persistent, extensive seed banks (Owen et al. 2001), partially because perennial species 

1) Six years after clearing of A. longifolia some shifts in 
recovery of species and patterns were obvious, including 
substantial increases in the area covered by several native 
shrubs and the invader itself; this was accompanied by a 
reduction in total plant cover (excluding A. longifolia) due to a 
substantial decline of some generalist, early coloniser 
species, which were especially abundant in plots soon after 
clearing. These shifts would have been missed in a short-
time study. 

2) Greater changes in recently invaded areas (observed in 
the five years period), i.e., higher turnover rates, points to an 
apparent stabilization of impacts in long-invaded areas (after 
a couple of decades). This would also have been missed in a 
short-time study.

studies worthwhile?

sometimes have alternative means of reproduction (Sternberg et al. 2003). Nevertheless, 

traits/species characteristic of dunes, that were lacking in the seed bank, were also absent in 

invaded stands, and others were very scarce (possibly close to being excluded) confirming their 

possible local exclusion. Even so, this does not imply that those species are extinct at a larger scale, 

a trend that has been similalrly found in other studies (Jäger, Kowarik &amp;amp; Tye, 2009).  

Impacts quantified in this study are expected to contribute to complete risk assessments that would 

allow, e.g., listing A. longifolia as an European “official pest” (Council Directive 2000/29/EC) or 

prioritizing management of Conservation Areas invaded by A. longifolia in order to restore their 

natural communities before native species are excluded. 

WHY DOES ACACIA LONGIFOLIA HAVE SUCH LARGE IMPACTS IN PLANT DUNE 
COMMUNITIES? 

Several characteristics of A. longifolia contribute to the changes observed after invasion, with 

environmental factors and ecosystem characteristics also contributing to some of the alterations. 

1) Acacia longifolia is a prolific seed producer, the seeds are long-lived and despite many being lost 

before or after entering the seed bank vast numbers still accumulated in the sand dunes (chapter 3), 

frequently exceeding the numbers of seeds of native plant species (chapter 4). Areas invaded for 

Studies measuring impacts of invasive species and quantifying recovery after clearing frequently use 
parameters expressed by one single figure, e.g. species richness, plant cover, diversity indexes. These 
parameters are undeniably useful, and as such were also selected in this study. However, alone they may 
conceal relevant information. With this underlying notion a range of other parameters were selected 
(similarity indexes, turnover rates, plant traits and rank abundances curves) aiming to get more insights into 
the plant communities under comparison. Besides losing some information, some of the single figure 
parameters may lead to "misinterpretation" which would be clarified by analysing other parameters. For 
example:  

 1) similarity index revealed that invaded and non-invaded areas had very distinct species assemblages, with 
just a few species in common, and were in fact more different than suggested by species richness; 

2) rank abundances revealed that some species contributing to richness of recently invaded areas were in 
fact very rare and therefore less likely to persist;  

3) species contributing to similarities in species richness and cover through time were not always the same, 
as revealed by high turnover rates;  

4) species traits allowed separation of species with distinct functions in the system (e.g., exotic vs. native; 
ephemeral vs. perennial; wind dispersed vs. animal dispersed).  

These results showed that over and above the advantages of not using single figure parameters, 
use a multiple range of parameters can also disentangle obscure patterns and trends. 

Box 7.3. Methodology (II): was it relevant to analyse diverse vegetation parameters?  



 

176 

longer time have particularly large accumulations of seeds. The density of A. longifolia seedlings in 

the field (chapter 5), stimulated by clearing operations, were much lower than the density of seeds 

observed in the soil, probably due to the absence of fire which is an important stimulus for 

germination of this species (Pieterse &amp;amp; Cairns, 1986). This means that even after clearing a hidden 

legacy/threat remains in the soil assuring future invasions. 

2) Acacia longifolia is a perennial species whose phyllodes decompose slowly (Marchante, 2008) 

resulting in the accumulation of a thick litter layer, which increases with time and is much thicker than 

that normally associated with uninvaded dune systems. This litter is richer in N than most of the 

native dune species, promoting changes in soil C and N cycle and fostering additional changes 

(Marchante et al., 2008b) which persist after A. longifolia removal (Marchante et al., 2009). The litter 

layer accumulated has major influence in the species that emerge and/or survive. 

3) Acacia longifolia, both due to its different physiognomy (i.e., a tree vs. the typical herbs, sub-

shrubs and shrubs) and its high density in dunes, assures that soil coverage is much denser than 

that provided by native dune species, and especially so under the dense canopies of plants in long-

invaded areas (chapter 2). This is partially explained by the faster growth rates (Peperkorn, Werner 

&amp;amp; Beyschlag, 2005) and higher ability to establish interactions with soil mutualists, mainly with 

symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Rodríguez-Echeverría et al. 2009), which results in the competitive 

advantage of A. longifolia, particularly when the plants have survived through the seedling stage, 

(Werner et al., 2008). Mortality of seedlings was high with few surviving (chapter 5). Its different 

physiognomy facilitated both the profound transformation of the landscape and the difficulty for other 

species to compete with it (chapter 2). Therefore, not only the invader matters, but its marked 

difference to the species of the recipient ecosystem also contributes to aggravate the level of 

impacts. 

4) Being an exotic species, A. longifolia lacks its natural enemies that would normally curtail its 

uncontrolled growth. 

5) Fire plays a fundamental role in the proliferation of the invasive stands through time by stimulating 

germination of A. longifolia seeds. This was particularly clear in the establishment of recently invaded 

stands that quickly proliferated after the summer fire of 1995, reaching more than 60% soil cover in 

less than eight years.

DO RESULTS SUGGEST THAT TRICHILOGASTER ACACIAELONGIFOLIAE SHOULD BE 
RELEASED IN PORTUGAL? 

Tests performed in quarantine (chapter 6) and extensive experience in South Africa (Dennill, 1990; 

Dennill et al., 1999) support the release of T. acaciaelongifoliae in Portugal (see Box. 7.4 for further 

steps before release). The overwhelming negative impacts of A. longifolia in dune communities 

(chapter 2; Marchante et al., 2008b) showed the urgent need for management actions that reduce 

invader density and threat. The results of this study and South African experience show that the 

introduction of T. acaciaelongifoliae has great potential to help to achieve this aim. Recovery studies 

indicated that the invaded communities will respond positively to A. longifolia reduction with 

appearance of many native plant species though some exotics will also be present and cannot be 

ignored (chapter 5); this supports T. acaciaelongifoliae introduction. Studies of recovery potential, 

such as these, are scarce but are essential to anticipate the response of communities after the 

introduction of a biocontrol agent (Denslow &amp;amp; D'Antonio, 2005). There is no real risk of wasps laying 

eggs on plants other than 

A. longifolia (chapter 6) and 

any potential indirect non-

target effects due to low 

levels of parasitoid 

acquisition (Hill &amp;amp; Hulley, 

1995; Manongi &amp;amp; Hoffmann, 

1995) should be minimal. 

Failing to establish due to 

changes of hemisphere or 

other environmental unsui-

tability is unlikely. Besides, 

any slight side effects will be 

more than offset by the 

substantial benefits that will 

accrue (both ecologically 

and economically) if the 

introduction of T. acaciae-

longifoliae succeeds. 

1. Preparation of a pest risk analysis (PRA), because 
T. acaciaelongifoliae is likely to cause injury to a plant (A. 
longifolia).  

2. Formal application to the Portuguese Authority (ICNB, Ministério do 
Ambiente e do Ordenamento do Território), including the PRA and 
asking for:  
a. Remove T. acaciaelongifoliae from the restrictions of Decreto-
Lei n.º 565/99 
b. A permit to release T. acaciaelongifoliae in the wild 

3. If permission to release is granted, establishment of contingency 
and monitoring plans. 

PRA will include (EPPO, 2009): 
Stage 1 - a brief Initiation – introductory section. 
Stage 2 - a risk assessment with two major sections:  
    Section A. categorization of the “pest” (i.e., biocontrol agent in this 
case) in the form of a binary decision tree 
    Section B. assessment of the probability of spread and potential 
economic consequences (performed only if the Section A concludes that 
the organism can be a pest).  
Stage 3 – a Pest Risk Management to determine if the risk is acceptable 
and to identify management options.  
Before or during stage 3, a public consultation should take place. 
 
* based on framework followed in UK, which is likely to have created 
precedents; more details in chapter 6.  

Box 7.4 Biocontrol further steps to release Trichilogaster 
acaciaelongifoliae*: brief guidelines 



 

178 

The use of T. acaciaelongifoliae should be integrated into a larger management program, e.g. 

including other control strategies, aimed at restoring the whole system, rather than being developed 

separately (Denslow &amp;amp; D'Antonio, 2005). Before release, realistic integrative goals should be set to 

subsequently evaluate the level of success of the project. Such goals should include both responses 

of the community and behaviour of the agent, e.g.: 1) successful establishment of the wasp; 2) 

reduction of A. longifolia cover to non problematic levels; 3) major decrease of seed production 

interrupting the continuous seed bank enrichment; 4) recovery/increase of native species diversity, 

and, consequently, 5) recover of ecosystem services. Baseline assessments, though scarce, are 

essential to compare with future post-release data and quantify the effectiveness of the biocontrol 

agent (Harley &amp;amp; Forno, 1992). In this thesis several of these assessments were made (quantification 

of annual seed production and resulting seed bank accumulation (chapter 3), A. longifolia and native 

species cover (chapter 2), responses of the vegetation to A. longifolia removal (chapter 5)) and will 

be valuable for future management. Growth phenology has also been studied for Portugal (Morais et 

al., unpublished data) and will be similarly useful. 

As suggested above, when considering invasive plant management (Holden, Fowler &amp;amp; Schroeder, 

1992; Murphy &amp;amp; Evans, 2009; Pyšek &amp;amp; Richardson, 2010; Wilson et al., submitted), biological control 

might be the only sustainable, cost effective and environmentally-sound way to prevent the 

escalation irreversible damages that A. longifolia will inevitably inflict on the ecology and biodiversity 

of whole communities of native organisms in Portugal, and further afield in Europe. 

 

CONCLUSIONS  

1. Management should not be delayed. Impacts of A. longifolia escalate with time and dispersal 

patterns indicate that stands will keep advancing so delaying management will aggravate the 

problem. Management actions should start before the resilience of the system is too low. In areas 

invaded for long time “doing nothing” may sometimes be the best option, i.e., when restoration is 

predicted to be very hard/impossible to achieve. This does not to seem to be the case for the 

invasion by A. longifolia in SJNRD, yet, as many native species were observed slowly (re)colonizing. 

However, if invaded areas are left, managers need to be aware that more vigorous and probably 

more expensive management efforts will then be needed if the invaded system is to be restored in 

the future. 



 

179 

2. Areas and species need to be prioritized: 

2.1. New foci of A. longifolia and/ or other exotic species should be targeted for rapid response, i.e., 

local eradication, control or containment depending on the situation. Seeds of A. longifolia were 

found several meters away from the invaded stands and new invasion foci occur hundreds of meters 

from the main thickets (chapter 3). These foci are manageable pockets of new invasion and should 

be prioritised for removal (Rejmánek &amp;amp; Pitcairn, 2002). The new foci of other invasive plants detected 

after clearing, e.g. Cortaderia selloana, C. edulis and Conyza spp. (chapter 5), should be managed 

first, or at the same time as A. longifolia, to prevent them becoming a bigger problem after 

A. longifolia removal. 

2.2. Recently invaded areas have higher prospects of successful recovery (chapter 5) and so should 

also be prioritized for control actions.  

3.  Follow-up control is crucial:  

3.1. Reinvasion by A. longifolia and secondary invasion by other exotic species occurred after 

removal of the invader (chapters 4 and 5). This threat intensifies as the invasion progresses because 

A. longifolia seed banks increase, even though many seeds are lost and the remaining loose some 

viability with time and become increasingly more dependent on a stimulus to germinate. Acacia 

longifolia saplings in sand dunes can be hand pulled easily when they reach 20 cm – 40 cm, 

avoiding waste of resources and time to eliminate smaller seedlings that will not survive anyway. 

Secondary invasion by C. edulis, particularly in recently invaded areas, C. selloana and Conyza spp. 

was also observed and cannot be ignored.  

3.2. Acacia longifolia seeds were viable for at least six years (chapter 3), but are expected to remain 

viable for even more years (Cavanagh, 1980; Daws et al., 2007). As the time to first reproduction is 

about two years, or even less for plants originating from resprouts, after removal of the invader the 

cleared area should be monitored, at least annually for six years, to set follow-up (and latter, 

maintenance) control actions in place (Grice, 2009). Moderate fire can be used to deplete the seed 

bank (Galatowitsch &amp;amp; Richardson, 2005) and will reduce the duration of follow up control. 

4. Non-invaded areas need also to be monitored. Although there was no A. longifolia trees in these 

areas, seeds were found in non-invaded areas and may initiate invasions if stimulated by 

disturbance (e.g., fire).  



 

180 

5. Removal of thick litter layers may be beneficial for recovery. Removing the thick litter layers (of 

long-invaded areas) eliminated many seeds of A. longifolia and facilitated the recovery of the areas. 

Removal of thinner litter layers (recently invaded areas) led to loss of species in the seed bank 

(chapter 4) and in the field (in 2002, chapter 5), but migrating species propagules compensated for 

that loss. The effort required to remove litter was not very cost-effective, particularly with thinner litter 

layers; moderate prescribed fire can be used to eliminate the thick litter layer and simultaneously 

destroy many seeds of the invasive species (Richardson &amp;amp; Kluge, 2008). 

6. Additional restoration measures may be needed to restore native plant communities, particularly in 

the areas invaded for a long time. Although many native species (re) colonised invaded areas after 

clearing, including several 

species characteristic of 

the dunes, many others 

were missing and other 

exotic species were 

present. This needs to be 

considered when planning 

recovery strategies. 

Autogenic recovery does 

not seem to be sufficient 

to allow full system 

recovery after clearing but 

will make a significant 

contribution (chapter 5). Transplanting of native species should be considered (Galatowitsch &amp;amp; 

Richardson, 2005), unless a novel or hybrid ecosystem, with a species assemblage distinct from the 

historic mixture, is set as a target instead (Hobbs et al., 2006). 

7. Biocontrol is a promising and sustainable option to integrate in a complete management program. 

Recovery studies showed that the system will react well to A. longifolia removal even though some 

other exotics will benefit from the reduction and have to be considered. In this context, and 

considering the results of specificity testing the introduction of the studied biocontrol agent – 

T. acaciaelongifoliae – is recommended as it will most likely be the most sustainable option to reduce 

A. longifolia to non-problematic levels. A combination of biological control together with initial control 

by mechanical methods will probably be the best option.  

It can be argued that without the introduction of the invasive A. longifolia 
(and other exotics such as C. edulis) sand from dunes would have been 
lost due to erosion, i.e., “sand dunes with A. longifolia” are better than “no 
sand dunes at all”.  An alternative could have been to use engineering 
solutions to stabilise sand, but these are in general very expensive. 

Marram grass (Ammophila arenaria), a perennial herb typical from 
Portuguese foredunes, has been used successfully to stabilize sands, both 
in the native range (Schreck Reis, Antunes do Carmo &amp;amp; Freitas, 2008) and 
in exotic ranges (e.g., south-east Australia (Heyligers, 1985) and California 
(Buell, Pickart &amp;amp; Stuart, 1995)). In the exotic range, it has become 
invasive, probably due to reduction in the abundance of root feeding 
nematodes, amongst other factors (van der Putten et al., 2005). In its 
native range, even with its growth, longevity and abundance reduced due 
to natural enemies, marram grass is very effective in stabilizing sands and 
could have been used more proactively. 

Box 7.5 Could different management options in the past have 
solved the erosion problem without introducing A. longifolia?
