ABSTRACT 

 

The pipelines used to transport oil and gas from the wellheads to the distribution and refining 

sites can be subjected to high levels of pressure and temperature. Under such conditions, the 

pipelines tend to expand, but, if the expansion is inhibited, a significant compressive axial force 

can arise, leading to their buckling, which can occur in the horizontal or vertical plane. In this 

context, the objective of the present work is to analyze the upheaval buckling of pipelines, 

considering the internal pressure to which they are subjected during the transportation of oil 

and gas as its only triggering. Using the concept of effective axial force, it aims at discussing 

two different approaches for considering the internal pressure in buckling problems: distributed 

loads dependent on pipeline curvature and equivalent compressive axial forces with follower 

and non-follower characteristics. It also discusses the influence of using static or dynamic 

analysis for such approaches. Concerning the upheaval buckling itself, the work intends to 

analyze and compare the influence of the soil imperfection amplitudes to the influence of the 

friction between the pipeline and the ground in the critical loads and in the post-buckling 

configurations of the pipeline. Besides theoretical research, the objectives are achieved through 

the development of various numerical models, since geometrically-simple models, without the 

consideration of the interaction between the pipeline and the ground, until more complex 

models, with the use of contact models to detect the ground and its imperfections. The models 

are developed in Giraffe (Generic Interface Readily Accessible for Finite Elements) using 

geometrically-exact finite element models of beams, undergoing large displacements and finite 

rotations. Through the research, it is concluded that there is an equivalence between the 

application of the internal pressure as a distributed load dependent on pipeline curvature and 

the application of the internal pressure as a follower compressive axial force. Besides this, it is 

demonstrated that the type of the analysis (static or dynamic) depends on the nature of the 

physical system analyzed. With the aid of results presented in terms of internal pressure, 

classical results about the influence of the imperfection amplitudes and of the friction between 

the pipeline and the ground in buckling are confirmed. It is also showed that the imperfection 

amplitudes analyzed play a more important role in the post-buckling configurations of the 

pipeline than the friction.

RESUMO 

 

Os dutos utilizados para transportar petróleo e gás natural das reservas até os locais de 

distribuição e refino podem estar submetidos a elevados níveis de pressão e temperatura. Sob 

tais condições, os dutos tendem a se expandir, porém, se a expansão é inibida, uma força axial 

de compressão significativa pode surgir nos dutos, ocasionando a flambagem lateral ou vertical 

dos mesmos. Dentro desse contexto, o objetivo do presente trabalho é analisar a flambagem 

vertical de dutos, considerando a pressão interna à qual eles estão submetidos durante o 

transporte de petróleo e gás natural como o único parâmetro desencadeador da flambagem. 

Usando o conceito de força axial efetiva, o trabalho objetiva discutir duas abordagens diferentes 

para considerar a pressão interna nos problemas de flambagem: carregamentos distribuídos 

dependentes da curvatura do duto e forças axiais de compressão equivalentes à pressão com 

caráter seguidor e não seguidor. O trabalho também discute a influência de usar a análise 

estática ou dinâmica para analisar essas abordagens de carregamento. Com relação à flambagem 

vertical propriamente dita, o trabalho pretende analisar e comparar a influência das amplitudes 

das imperfeições presentes no solo com a influência do atrito entre o duto e o solo nas cargas 

críticas e nas configuração pós-críticas do duto. Além de pesquisa teórica, os objetivos são 

atingidos através do desenvolvimento de vários modelos numéricos, desde modelos 

geometricamente simples, sem a consideração da interação entre o duto e o solo, até modelos 

mais complexos, com o uso de modelos de contato para detectar o solo e suas imperfeições. Os 

modelos são desenvolvidos no Giraffe (Generic Interface Readily Accessible for Finite 

Elements) usando elementos finitos geometricamente exatos de viga, sujeitos a grandes 

deslocamentos e rotações finitas. Através da pesquisa, conclui-se que existe uma equivalência 

entre a aplicação da pressão interna como um carregamento distribuído dependente da curvatura 

do duto e a aplicação da pressão interna como uma força axial de compressão seguidora. Além 

disso, demonstra-se que o tipo de análise (estática e dinâmica) depende da natureza do sistema 

físico analisado. Com a ajuda de resultados apresentados em termos de pressão interna, os 

resultados clássicos sobre a influência das amplitudes das imperfeições e do atrito entre o duto 

e o solo são confirmados. Também é mostrado que as amplitudes das imperfeições analisadas 

desempenham uma maior influência nas configurações pós-críticas do duto do que o atrito.

1 INTRODUCTION 

 

The production of oil and gas has increased in Brazil in the recent years. 

According to data from National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels1 (2015), the 

production of oil increased from 1.65 million barrels per day in 2005 to 2.30 million barrels per 

day in 2014 and the production of natural gas increased from 17.10 billion cubic meters per 

year in 2005 to 31.90 billion cubic meters per year in 2014. Despite the high production values, 

the amount of existing proved reservoirs is even larger: at the end of 2014 there were 16.20 

billion barrels of oil and 471.10 billion cubic meters of natural gas. Most of such reservoirs, 

about 95% and 85%, respectively, are in the sea and many of them in deep waters, such as the 

pre-salt reservoirs. These conditions require constant development of new technologies of oil 

and gas exploitation by industry. 

In the productive chain of oil and gas, providing from onshore and offshore 

fields, once performed the extraction, it is necessary to transport the fluid to the distribution and 

refining sites. Such transportation is made predominantly by pipelines. For example, 

specifically in the case of subsea pipelines, according to Bai and Bai (2014), the term of subsea 

flowlines is used to describe subsea pipelines that transport oil and gas from the wellhead to the 

riser base. The riser, in its turn, is connected to the processing facilities. Finally, the 

transportation from there to shore is performed by export pipelines.  

Since the oil and gas fields have high pressure and high temperature (HPHT), 

the fluids usually leave the reservoirs still keeping such thermodynamic state during the 

transportation. If it changes, wax and hydrate may be formed as the fluid cools along the 

pipeline, which is not desired. Therefore, in order to make the transportation more efficient, it 

is necessary that the pipelines operate at high pressure and temperature conditions. These 

conditions are becoming more and more severe since the oil and gas industries are advancing 

and discovering new reservoirs, especially in deep water regions. According to Bai and Bai 

(2014), there are three different levels of HPHT operation. The first level corresponds to 

reservoirs that have pressures up to 103 MPa and temperatures up to 177 oC. The second level, 

in its turn, is defined as “extreme” operations with pressures up to 138 MPa and temperatures 

up to 204 oC. Finally, the third level corresponds to “ultra” operations with pressures up to 207 

MPa and temperatures up to 260 oC. In Brazil, the pipelines operated by Transpetro (2017), for 

example, are subjected to pressures not larger than 20 MPa. So, their operation can be included

in the first level described by Bai and Bai (2014). 

Among other implications of HPHT operation in pipelines, the tendency of 

longitudinal expansion can be cited. In practice, the expansion movement can be restricted, both 

by constraints at the pipeline ends and by the soil-pipeline interaction, generating a compressive 

axial force that, combined, for example, with the soil imperfections and the laying deviations, 

can cause the buckling of the pipeline. When the compressive axial force reaches a certain 

critical level of magnitude, the pipeline can experience two types of buckling: upheaval 

buckling and lateral buckling (Figure 1). The first type, which, as its name suggests, occurs in 

the vertical plane, is more common in buried pipelines and the second type, which occurs in the 

horizontal plane, is more common in exposed pipelines, since the lateral resistance in the first 

type is larger than in the second type.

The aforementioned two types of buckling consist in global phenomena and, by 

themselves, do not correspond to failure modes, but only to load responses. However, according 

to the recommended practice DNV-RP-F110 of Det Norske Veritas (2007), the buckling of 

pipelines can propitiate, due to excessive bending, the occurrence of failures like local buckling, 

fracture and fatigue. The local buckling occurs due to the combination of longitudinal forces, 

pressure and bending. It can occur by yielding of the cross section or buckling on the 

compressive side of the pipe. The fracture is caused by excessive tensile strains and can include 

brittle fracture and plastic collapse. Finally, fatigue can occur due to cyclic loads such as vortex 

induced vibration (VIV), pressures, thermal and hydrodynamic loads (FAN, 2013). Such failure 

modes may cause serious accidents since the fluid that is transported may leak and contaminate 

the environment. In 2000, for example, in Guanabara Bay, Brazil, the lateral buckling caused 

local buckling and fracture of the wall of the Petrobras’ pipeline PE-II, leaking 1300 cubic 



30 

 

meters of oil. This accident, illustrated in Figure 2, occurred due to the increase of the 

operational pressure and temperature of the pipeline (CARDOSO, 2005).

pipeline PE-II.

In this context, studies related to buckling of pipelines are justified, because this 

phenomenon may lead to structural damages that may cause accidents. Accidents have 

disastrous consequences for the economy, both as regards the loss of production and the 

reconstruction of damaged structures, and for the environment. Thus, their probability of 

occurrence must be minimized. 

 

1.1 OBJECTIVES  

 

The general objective of the present work is to analyze the upheaval instability 

of pipelines (flowlines) triggered by the internal pressure to which they are subjected during 

the transportation of oil and gas from wellheads, experiencing different load approaches, 

boundary conditions and soil imperfections.  

More specifically, the objectives can be divided into two groups. The first, 

concerning the procedures for modelling and analyzing the buckling phenomenon, aims at 

verifying and discussing the equivalence between different approaches for considering the 

internal pressure: distributed loads dependent on pipeline curvature and equivalent compressive 

axial forces with follower and non-follower characteristics. It also discusses the influence of 

using static or dynamic analysis for such approaches. The second group of objectives, 

Original configuration 

of the pipeline 

Post-buckling configuration of 

the pipeline 
Soil displaced by the pipeline 



31 

 

concerning the buckling phenomenon properly speaking, aims at analyzing relatively two main 

parameters that can influence the buckling of pipelines regarding the critical load and the post-

buckling configuration: the isolated imperfections existing on the ground on which the pipeline 

is laid and the soil friction coefficients. 

  

1.2 METHODOLOGY 

 

The objectives proposed for the present work will be achieved through literature 

review and numerical simulations. Concerning the theoretical part of this work, the topics 

addressed are: effective axial force, buckling of pipelines, stability of structures and contact 

models. The numerical simulations, in their turn, involve the development of models using 

finite element software for nonlinear analysis Giraffe (Generic Interface Readily Accessible for 

Finite Elements), under continuous development at University of São Paulo. Such 

geometrically nonlinear finite element models allow the consideration of large displacements 

and finite rotations, which can be especially important for the study of the pipeline post-

buckling configurations, which can, in their turn, play a fundamental role in the study of 

possible failure modes resulting from the buckling of pipelines. It is worth mentioning, 

however, that the study of such failure modes by itself is not in the scope of the present work. 

In a first step, geometrically-simple pipeline models are simulated using 

Timoshenko beam elements, without the consideration of the contact between the pipeline and 

the ground. The objective of such step is to understand the phenomenon of buckling due to 

internal pressure for several simple cases, real or hypothetical, experiencing different boundary 

conditions and imperfection magnitudes. It also aims at discussing the equivalence between 

approaches that involve the application of the internal pressure as a distributed load dependent 

on pipeline curvature and as an equivalent compression with follower and non-follower 

characteristics, besides discussing the influence of using static or dynamic analysis for such 

approaches.  

In a second step, more complex models are simulated, which involve, besides 

the pipeline itself, the ground and the contact between the pipeline and ground. Varying 

parameters such as imperfection amplitudes and soil friction coefficients, the objective of the 

models is to determine the influence of these parameters in the buckling of pipelines, discussing 

relatively how they modify the critical load and the post-buckling configuration of the pipeline. 

For the two steps of numerical simulations, whenever possible, the results 

obtained numerically are compared to results obtained from existing analytical models.

1.3 STRUCTURE OF THE WORK

description of the subject. It also includes the justification, the objectives and the methodology 

of the research.

strains, pipe stresses, effective axial force and buckling of pipelines. Through this section, the

researches that have been developed in the area and the contact formulation used in the 

numerical models presented later in the work.

2 LITERATURE REVIEW 

 

This section presents an overview of buckling of pipelines. Firstly, some basic 

concepts about pipe strains and stresses are highlighted for a better understanding of the 

influence of temperature and pressure in the pipe structure. Then, the main lines of research 

related to buckling of pipelines are summarized in order to contextualize the objectives of the 

present work. Among them, including both analytical and numerical analyses, one may cite 

those concerning the effective axial force, those concerning the buckling description and those 

concerning the parameters that can influence the buckling of pipelines. 

 

2.1 STRAINS AND STRESSES 

 

2.1.1 Pipe strains 

 

As mentioned in the introduction of the present work, HPHT pipelines tend to 

expand longitudinally. This movement can be prevented partially or totally by the friction that 

arises between the pipeline and the soil and by the end restraints. According to Bai and Bai 

(2014), the effects of temperature, pressure and friction can be discussed in terms of strains. As 

assumed by Bai and Bai (2014), the present work will also assume that the material of the 

pipeline is elastic-linear. 

The longitudinal strain ?, induced by a temperature change ?T, if there is no 
restriction to the pipeline movement, is given by Eq. (1). The parameter ? is the linear thermal 
coefficient of the pipeline material. It is worth mentioning that positive strains and stresses are 

taken as being of tension. 

 ?, = ??T  (1) 
 

The longitudinal strain ?* induced by pressure, in its turn, has two components. 
The first component consists in the strain ???? caused by the difference of longitudinal pressures 
between the sides of an end cap, if it exists in the pipeline. Considering the Hooke’s law, such 

strain can be determined through Eq. (2), in which p? is the external pressure, p? is the internal 
pressure, A? is the external area of the pipeline cross section, A? is the internal bore area of the 
pipeline cross section, A is the area of the pipeline cross section and E is the Young’s modulus. 



34 

 ???? =  p?A??p?A?EA  (2) 
 

The second component ?*+???+? of the longitudinal strain induced by pressure 
results from Poisson effect and it is proportional to the hoop and radial strains. Such strain is 

given by Eq. (3), in which ? is the Poisson ratio. 
 

?*+???+? = ?  2?E ?p?A? ? p?A?A ? (3) 
 

It can be noted that the strain caused by the end cap effect and the strain caused 

by the Poisson effect are opposed and ?*  can be given by Eq. (4).  
 

?* =  31 ? 2?5E ?p?A? ? p?A?A ? (4) 
 

The friction resistance developed between the pipeline and the soil consists in a 

passive effect, that is, it is activated only if the pipeline moves or tends to move, and tries to 

avoid the strains caused by temperature and pressure. 

For a pipeline that is not buried and does not have longitudinal movement 

restriction at its ends, the strain ?? induced by friction is given by Eq. (5), which ?? is the axial 
friction coefficient between the pipeline and the soil, R? is the normal force of contact per unit 
length of pipeline and x? is the longitudinal coordinate with origin at the end of the pipeline. 

 

 ?? = ? ??R?x?EA  (5) 
 

If the pipeline is buried, the existing resistance to its movement is larger, since 

there is the action of the soil around the whole pipeline cross section. One of the ways to 

estimate the axial friction force per unit length F] can be found in the recommended practice 
DNV-RP-F110 of Det Norske Veritas (2007) and in the guideline of American Society of Civil 

Engineers (2001). This force is shown in Eq. (6), which uses the following notation: D? is 
external diameter of the pipeline, ?? is the adhesion factor, C is the soil cohesion representative 
of the soil backfill, H is the buried depth of the pipeline centerline, ?? is the submerged weight 
of soil per unit volume, Km is the coefficient of pressure at rest and ?? is the internal angle of 



35 

 

friction between the pipeline and the soil. 

 F] =  ?D???C + ?D?H??31 + Km5tan 3??5/2 (6) 
 

With such friction force, the strain ?? induced by friction for buried pipelines is 
given by Eq. (7). 

 

 ?? = ? F]x?EA  (7) 
 

Finally, the total longitudinal strain ? of the pipeline, considering the effects of 
temperature, pressure and friction, is given by Eq. (8). 

 ? = ?, + ?* + ?? (8) 
 

2.1.2 Pipe stresses 

 

Once the strains are partially or totally restrained in practice, axial stresses arise 

in the pipeline. For example, when a pipeline is completely restrained in the longitudinal 

direction, the stress ?, induced by temperature change is given by Eq. (9). In terms of the force 
in the pipe wall, the temperature change ?T generates an axial force Pm,, given by Eq. (10). 

 ?, = ?E??T (9) 
 Pm,, = ?EA??T (10) 
 

Concerning the pressure effects in the pipeline, three components of stress can 

be generated, even without restriction to movement: hoop stress (??), radial stress (?C) and 
longitudinal stress (?B). Such stresses correspond to principal stresses if there are no shear 
stresses in directions of the cylindrical coordinate system. 

For a thin-walled pipe, the radial stress is negligible and the longitudinal and 

hoop stresses are given by Eq. (11) and Eq. (12), respectively, in which t is the thickness of the 
pipeline cross section and D? is the internal diameter of the pipeline. Two assumptions are made: 
there are end caps and the pipeline is free to expand. Adaptations can be made in such 

expressions to address other situations. 



36 

 ?B,?A?? = 3p?D? ? p?D?54t  (11) 
 

??,?A?? = 3p?D? ? p?D?52t  (12) 
 

Finally, for a thick-walled pipe, the radial, longitudinal and hoop stresses are 

given by Eq. (13), Eq. (14) and Eq. (15), respectively. The assumptions made for the thin-

walled pipe are still valid for the following equations and D is the diameter in which hoop stress 
or radial stress is calculated (YOUNG; BUDYNAS; SADEGH, 2011). 

 

?C,?A??? = p?D?6 ? p?D?6D?6 ? D? 6 ? D?
6D? 6D6?D?6 ? D?6? 3p? ? p?5 (13) 

 

?B,?A??? = p?D?6 ? p?D? 6D?6 ? D?6  (14) 
 

??,?A??? = p?D?6 ? p?D?6D?6 ? D? 6 + D?
6D? 6D6?D?6 ? D?6? 3p? ? p?5 (15) 

 

In order to verify if the pipe subjected to the previous stresses is yielding, the 

Von Misses criterion can be used. Through such criterion, based on the distortion-energy 

theory, the general form of the Von Misses stress (??), given by Eq. (16), has to be compared 
to the yielding strength of the pipe material. ?B?, ?BC and ??C are shear stresses. 

 

?? =  ?12 ?3?B ? ??56 + 3?? ? ?C56 +3?C ? ?B56 + 63?B?6 + ?BC6 + ??C65? (16) 
 

For thin-walled pipes, Eq. (16) can be simplified, since ?C, ?B? and ?B? are 
approximately zero. Such simplification generates Eq. (17). 

 

?? =  ??B6 + ?? 6 ? ?B??+3??C6 (17) 
 



37 

 

2.2 EFFECTIVE AXIAL FORCE 

 

To analyze the global buckling of pipelines (lateral and upheaval buckling), the 

concept of effective axial force must be introduced. The reason for such need is in the fact that 

the axial force governing parameter, responsible for buckling, when pressure is present, is not 

the integration of the longitudinal stresses, detailed in Section 2.1.2, on the pipeline cross 

section. The axial force resulting from such integration is important to analyze local 

phenomena, such as local buckling, but not global phenomena. 

It is important to have in mind that, for a global analysis, the effects of internal 

and external pressures can be analyzed by their integration on the internal and external wall 

areas of the pipeline, respectively. However, this procedure requires a lot of algebraic work 

depending on pipe geometry, such as dealing with curved pipe configurations. Gay Neto, 

Pimenta and Martins (2017) and therein referenced works discuss the topic, proposing, by the 

way, a formulation to apply the pressures as equivalent distributed loads that are dependent on 

pipe curvature. Such formulation will be commented with more details later in the present work. 

Another way for considering the pressure effects in the buckling of pipelines is 

analyzing an equivalent force in the pipeline axial direction related to pressure loads. This 

approach, although easier, has to be used with caution since its physical interpretation is non-

direct. For example, pipelines without end caps and only subjected to internal pressure have the 

tendency of contraction in the axial direction. It happens because the existing tensile hoop stress 

generates, by Poisson effect, a compressive strain in the axial direction, if there is no restriction 

in the pipe. However, when the axial movement of the pipeline is restricted in practical 

situations, a tensile stress arises in the pipeline. In this way, sometimes it is difficult to 

understand why pipelines buckle due to internal pressure. Actually, as aforementioned, the 

force that governs the buckling of pipelines is not the real force given by the integration of the 

stresses on the cross section. This phenomenon is governed by the called effective axial force, 

which becomes compressive due to internal pressure. Therefore, there are other pressure effects 

in the pipeline axial direction besides the contribution of the Poisson effect.  

Sparks (1984) is one of the main authors who deal with the effective axial force. Fyrileiv and 

Collberg (2005), in their turn, summarize the knowledge about the topic. For the next 

discussions, based on the studies of the previous authors, consider the pipe segment shown in 

Figure 3 and the following additional notation: ds is the pipe segment length, T?T is the true 
axial force in the pipe wall (as a result of the integration of the stresses on the pipe cross section), dT?T is an infinitesimal change of T?T, w is the pipe self-weight per unit length, ?? is the specific 



38 

 

mass of the internal fluid, ?? is the specific mass of the external fluid and g is the gravitational 
field intensity.

A pipe segment without end caps and subjected to internal and external pressures 

is not a closed pressure field. Therefore, the Archimedes’ principle cannot be applied. To apply 

such principle is necessary to transform the original pipe physical system into an equivalent 

sum of three different pipe physical systems. The first of the three physical systems is a closed 

pipe on which acts the external pressure. By the Archimedes’ principle, the action of the 

external pressure is equivalent to an upward-directed force. The magnitude of this force is the 

weight of the external fluid displaced by the pipe segment (buoyancy of the pipe). The second 

system is a closed pipe on which acts the internal pressure. The action of the internal pressure 

is equivalent to a downward-directed force. The magnitude of this force is the weight of the 

internal fluid. Finally, the last physical system is a closed pipe on which act, besides the pipe 

self-weight and the true axial force, pressures at the pipe ends. These pressures have the 

opposite signs to those applied in the first and in the second physical systems, compensating 

the additional terms included in those systems. Gay Neto, Pimenta and Martins (2017) discuss 

the three systems performing the integration of the pressures on the internal and external wall 

areas of the pipeline.  

The effective axial force (Pm) is the resultant axial force at the pipe segment ends, 
with positive values for tension and negative values for compression, given by Eq. (18). 

 



39 

 Pm = T?T + p?A? ? p?A? (18) 
 

With respect to Eq. (18), the term called true axial force T?T can be composed, 
for example, by the contributions of the axial effect of temperature, the axial effect of soil 

friction and the axial effect of pressure (the Poisson effect and the end cap effect – if there are 

end caps in the pipe indeed). Besides this, it is worth emphasizing that the present work has the 

objective to analyze only the internal pressure effect as a constant value (and even without 

considering the internal hydrostatic pressure characterization). Thus, the term p?A? will be 
disregarded in all analyses.  

 

2.3 BUCKLING OF PIPELINES 

 

Once understood the concept of effective axial force, it is necessary to know 

when such force causes buckling. Studies related to this subject are presented in the following 

sections, which deal with analytical and numerical analyses separately. 

 

2.3.1 Analytical analyses 

 

There are analytical studies about buckling of pipelines with and without 

imperfections. These studies are discussed below and consider positive axial forces as being of 

compression. 

 

2.3.1.1  Pipelines without imperfections 

 

Hobbs (1984) was one of the first researchers to deal with buckling specifically 

in pipelines. His work involves studies about upheaval buckling and lateral buckling without 

imperfections.  

For the upheaval buckling, Hobbs (1984) summarizes the existing method and 

results for railway tracks, since the same idea can be applied for pipelines. The analysis of 

upheaval buckling involves basically two regions: the deformed region of the pipeline (buckle 

region) and the slip region. For the buckle region, Hobbs (1984) assumes the pipeline as a 

Bernoulli-Euler beam that is subjected to an axial force P and to its self-weight and considers 
that the problem is elastic-linear with small slopes. Besides this, Hobbs (1984) considers that 

the soil is rigid and that the friction is fully mobilized. The analysis consists in solving the 



40 

 

differential equation for the deflected pipeline. It is assumed that the shape of the buckle is one 

half-wave and that the bending moment at the lift-off point is zero. Figure 4 illustrates the 

described model with the following notation: w is the pipeline self-weight per unit length (if 
the pipeline is buried, the overburden is also included); L is the buckle length; ?? is the axial 
friction coefficient between the pipeline and the soil,  L? is the length of the pipeline that slides 
in towards the buckle and s is the axial displacement that occurs at the lift-off point. 

From the assumptions made, the pipeline deflection v in y-direction can be 
obtained from the solution of Eq. (19), in which I is the second moment of area of the cross 
section, v?? is the second derivative of the deflection with respect to the coordinate x and M is 
the bending moment on the deflected pipeline. M can be obtained by Eq. (20) considering the 
parameters shown in Figure 4.  

 

Figure 4 – Hobbs’ method for upheaval buckling of pipelines without imperfections – 

topology and axial force distribution. 

 

Source: adapted from Hobbs (1984). 

 M = EIv??   (19) 
 

M = ?Pv ? w8 3?L6 + 4x65 (20) 
 

Substituting Eq. (20) into Eq. (19), Eq. (21) is obtained, in which the parameters m and n6 are, respectively, w EI?  and P EI? .  



41 

 v?? + n6v + m8 3?L6 + 4x65 = 0 (21) 
 

The solution of Eq. (21) is the sum of the solution vA of the equivalent 
homogeneous differential equation with the particular solution v?. The solution of the 
equivalent homogeneous differential equation is given by Eq. (22), in which the constants A" 
and A6 still need to be determined.   

 vA = A" cos3nx5 + A6 sen3nx5 (22) 
 

The particular solution, in its turn, is given by Eq. (23). 

 

v? = ? m2n6 x6 + m8n6 L6 + mni (23) 
 

Therefore, the expression for the pipeline deflection v can be obtained by Eq. 
(24). The pipeline slope v?, which is the first derivative of v with respect to the coordinate x, 
can also be determined. Eq. (25) provides the expression for the slope.  

 

v =  A" cos3nx5 + A6sen3nx5 ? m2n6 x6 + m8n6 L6 + mni (24) 
 

v? = ?A" sen3nx5 n + A6 cos3nx5 n ? mn6 x (25) 
 

The deflection at the buckle ends and the slope at the midspan are zero. With 

such boundary conditions, the constants A" and A6 can be obtained and Eq. (24) and Eq. (25) 
can be rewritten. Eq. (26) and Eq. (27) are the final expressions for the deflection and for the 

slope, respectively. 

 

v =  mni £? cos 3nx5cos ¤n L2¥ ?
n6x62 + n6L68 + 1¦ (26) 

 

v? =  mnicos ¤n L2¥ nsen 3nx5 ?
mn6 x (27) 

 



42 

 

According to Hobbs (1984), the relation between the axial force P and the buckle 
length L can be obtained considering that the slope at the buckle ends also should be zero (rigid 
soil). From such assumption, nL = 8.9868 is obtained. Therefore, the relation between P and L is given by Eq. (28). 
 

P = 80.76 EIL6 (28) 
 

Since the real length of the pipeline becomes larger than L after the buckling 
(there is a stress relief), the axial force P at the buckle is smaller than the axial force Pm away 
from the buckle. Figure 4 presents the axial force distribution along the buckle: the non-uniform 

axial force distributions correspond to the axial force distributions at the slip regions and the 

discontinuities correspond to the axial forces generated by the friction that arises from the 

vertical reactions w L 2?  at the lift-off points.  
The relation between P and Pm can be obtained from a compatibility equation for 

axial displacements.  As the buckling occurs, the buckle length increases. Obviously, the buckle 

length differs from the pipeline arc length after the buckling, as previously mentioned.  The 

difference between the pipeline arc length after the buckling (L") and the buckle length (L5 is 
given by Eq. (29).  

 

L" ? L = ª 3v?56dxB/6m  (29) 
 

To maintain the equilibrium, L" ? L has to be equal to the sum of the extension ? of the pipeline generated by the axial force variation with the inward displacement s that 
occurs at the slip length, which is not lifted off from the ground. The axial displacement s 
appears when the difference between Pm and P exceeds the friction force ??w L 2?  available at 
the lift-off points.  

The extension of the pipeline generated by the axial force variation can be 

obtained by Eq. (30). 

 

? = 3Pm ? P5LEA  (30) 
 

With respect to the axial displacement that occurs at the slip length, it is 



43 

 

necessary to first obtain the slip length. From Figure 4, Eq. (31) and Eq. (32) can be obtained. 

It is worth remembering that the friction is assumed fully mobilized. 

 

Pm ? ??wL? ? ?? wL2 = P (31) 
 

L? = 3Pm ? P5??w ? 0.5L (32) 
 

Then, the displacement s that occurs at the slip length can be found from Eq. 
(33) and Eq. (34): 

 

s = ??wL?L?EA  (33) 
 

s =  ?3Pm ? P5 ? 0.5L??w?6EA??w  (34) 
 

The compatibility equation for axial displacements is expressed by Eq. (35). 

 ? + s = L" ? L (35) 
 

Performing the substitutions, the relation between Pm and P is given by Eq.  (36). 
 

Pm = P + wLEI ?0.00001597EA??wLj ? 0.253??EI56?"/6  (36) 
 

Other parameters can also be found, as the maximum amplitude of the buckle v?, 
the maximum bending moment Mu  and the maximum slope v?u  (? 0,1 for the assumption of small 
slopes). These parameters are shown, respectively, in Eq. (37), Eq. (38) and Eq. (39). 

 

v? = 0.002408 wLiEI  
 

  

(37) 

Mu = 0.06938wL6   (38) 
 



44 

 

v?u = 0.008657 wLIEI  (39) 
 

When the coefficient of friction between the pipeline and the soil is very large, 

there is no slip length. Therefore, for such case, the new compatibility equation and the new 

relation between P and Pm are given, respectively, by Eq. (40) and Eq. (41). 
 ? = L" ? L (40) 

 

Pm = P + 0.00001597 w6EAL®3EI56  (41) 
 

As shown, the load P and the buckle length L are dependent. In the Euler’s 
column buckling theory, since the position and the types of support are well defined, the buckle 

length is known. However, this fact does not happen in the case of pipelines, which are in 

contact with the soil. Once the buckle length is unknown, it is difficult to predict analytically 

the load for which the pipeline buckles. Therefore, it is common to adopt certain values for the 

buckle length and, then, obtain the loads P and Pm. The results can be summarized, for example, 
by graphs that relate the temperature rise (it can be obtained by Eq. (10) using Pm) or the pressure 
variation (it can be obtained by Eq. (18) using Pm) and the buckle length or the buckle amplitude.  

To illustrate the formulation proposed by Hobbs (1984) for the upheaval 

buckling, an example is shown below. The data are presented in Table 1. It is important to 

highlight that Hobbs (1984) presents the results only in terms of temperature rise. As the present 

work focuses on the internal pressure effect, besides the graph of temperature rise versus buckle 

length (Figure 5), the graph of internal pressure versus buckle length is also presented in Figure 

6, for several coefficients of friction. As the external pressure is not considered, the pressure 

variation is equal to the internal pressure. At this point of the work, the only concern is the 

presentation of the results obtained by Hobbs (1984). The best way to apply the internal 

pressure, as well as the verification of equivalence between the various possible load 

approaches, will be discussed in the numerical analyses presented later in this work.

From Figure 5 and Figure 6, it can be noted that the critical loads for buckling 

(the minimum points of the curves) are smaller when the friction coefficients are smaller than 

when the friction coefficients are larger, which is a result consistent with the expectations.  

Hobbs (1984) also applies the procedure previously described for the lateral 

buckling and the same kind of results is obtained. The possible lateral buckling modes are 

represented in Figure 7. It is worth mentioning that, in the lateral buckling, the deflection v does 
not belong to the vertical plane, but to the horizontal plane, in which the buckling occurs. 

Therefore, to generalize, the present work considers that the deflection v occurs in the direction 
perpendicular to the pipeline axis in the buckling plane (horizontal plane for lateral buckling, 

for example).

The author, to simplify the study, adopts initially a buckling mode with infinite 

series of half-waves to derive the expressions for lateral buckling, since the soil cannot be 

considered rigid in this type of buckling and the assumption of concentrated reactions at the 

ends of the buckle would not be true.  

The analysis of the infinite buckling mode does not cause many modifications 



47 

 

in the differential equation that governs the buckle, Eq. (21), except that the parameter m 
becomes ?Bw EI? , in which ?B is the lateral friction coefficient between the pipeline and the 
soil. Besides this, there is a modification in the boundary condition used to determine the 

relation between P and L. Hobbs (1984) imposes that the shear force at x = ± L 2?  is equal to 
zero. Although this condition seems to be incoherent, the formulation proposed by Hobbs 

(1984) will be shown and, then, relevant discussions will be performed. From the condition, nL = 2? is obtained. Therefore, the relation between P and L is given by Eq. (42).  
 

P = 4?6 EIL6 (42) 
 

In the infinite buckling mode, there is no slip length. Therefore, the compatibility 

equation is given by Eq. (40) and the relation between P and Pm can be obtained by Eq. (43). 
 

Pm = P + 0.00004705 ?B6w6EAL®3EI56  (43) 
 

Other parameters can also be found, as the maximum amplitude of the buckle v?, 
the maximum bending moment Mu  and the maximum slope v?u  (? 0,1 for the assumption of small 
slopes). These parameters are shown, respectively, in Eq. (44), Eq. (45) and Eq. (46). 

 

v? = 0.0044495 ?BwLiEI  (44) 
 Mu = 0.05066?BwL6   (45) 
 

v?u = 0.01267 ?BwLIEI  (46) 
 

As commented in advance, the imposition of null shear forces at x = ± L 2?  for 
the infinite mode seems to be incoherent, since the problem is antisymmetric. And, in fact, the 

points x = ± L 2?  consist in points of inflection, in which the bending moments are zero, but 
the shear forces are not. More recently, Peek (2009) also detects such problem and proposes a 

formulation without the assumption of Hobbs (1984). Without going into too much details, his 

formulation is described below. Peek (2009) does not establish an explicit equation that relates 



48 

 P and L. For the determination of the critical load Pm, the author determines L for which the ratio 
between L" ? L and L is minimum. With  L, Peek (2009) determines P for which Pm is minimum 
through expressions which provide from the compatibility condition. The author concludes that 

results are not much different from those obtained by Hobbs (1984). For a specific numerical 

example, the author shows that the critical force obtained by Hobbs (1984) is only 1.4% larger 

than that obtained using the new conditions. So, the boundary conditions do not seem to change 

the results very much. 

Hobbs (1984) also summarizes the work of Kerr (1978), who addresses the 

lateral buckling that occurs in railway tracks using the principle of virtual displacements and 

the variational calculus, and Martinet (1936 apud HOBBS, 1984, p. 181) to detail the buckling 

modes 1, 2, 3 and 4. Considering that L is the half-wavelength of the most significant part of 
the buckle and using the constants shown in Table 2, the expressions for the lateral buckling 

are given by Eq. (47), Eq. (48), Eq. (49) and Eq. (50). It is worth mentioning that, for Hobbs 

(1984), there is no difference between lateral and axial friction coefficients. However, as some 

authors consider such difference in later works, the following expressions incorporate 

separately the lateral friction coefficient and the axial friction coefficient.

To illustrate the formulation proposed by Hobbs (1984) for the lateral buckling, 

an example is shown below. The data are the same as those presented in Table 1 and the graphs 

of temperature rise versus buckle length obtained for several coefficients of friction (lateral and 

axial coefficients of friction were considered equal) are shown in Figure 8, Figure 10, Figure 

12, Figure 14 and Figure 16 for the five buckling modes. The graphs of internal pressure versus 

buckle length, in their turns, are shown in Figure 9, Figure 11, Figure 13, Figure 15 and Figure 

17.

Hobbs (1984) concludes that lateral buckling occurs with smaller compressive 

forces than upheaval buckling. According to the author, these results are not true if the pipeline 

is buried, since the lateral resistance becomes larger and does not allow the pipeline to buckle 

in the horizontal plane. Considering that the pipeline is not buried, the axial force for which the 

pipeline buckles is smaller for the buckling modes 2, 3 and 4 than for the buckling modes 1 and 

infinite.  

It is worth reinforcing that Hobbs (1984) does not consider imperfections in his 

models, although the author highlights its importance since perfect pipelines do not buckle and 

real pipelines have imperfections. These imperfections can be, for example, irregularities of the 

ground and initial out-of-straightness due to the laying operations. 

 

2.3.1.2  Pipelines with imperfections 

 

Considering the need for new researches in the field pointed by Hobbs (1984), 

Taylor and Gan (1986) perform similar analyses to the work of the previous author. They study 

both upheaval buckling and lateral buckling (modes 1 and 2) and assume small deflections and 

elastic-linear behavior of the pipe material. In their work, however, there is the consideration 



55 

 

of structural imperfections. Beyond the consideration of such imperfections, the authors 

consider a deformation-dependent axial friction, that is, the friction is not fully mobilized.  

Concerning the axial friction model assumed by Taylor and Gan (1986), it is 

given by Eq. (51), in which ?? is the fully mobilized axial friction coefficient, u? is the axial 
displacement corresponding to ??, u is the real axial displacement of the pipeline at the slip 
region and f? is the axial friction parameter corresponding to u. It is worth highlighting that the 
convention used in the expression considers that the friction force that arises at the slip region 

and the displacement have the same orientation. If this convention is not used, the exponent of 

Eq. (51) has to become negative. 

 f??? = 1 ? e
6joo?  (51) 

 

Using the previous axial friction model, the authors study first the upheaval 

buckling. The same notation used to explain the work of Hobbs (1984) will be used here to 

present the formulation proposed by Taylor and Gan (1986). However, some new parameters 

have to be introduced: vm is the vertical deflection of the conformal imperfection topology, v?m 
is the maximum vertical amplitude of the conformal imperfection topology, Lm is the buckle 
length of the conformal imperfection topology, nm is equal to wPmm EI?  and Pmm is the axial force 
at the buckle region for the initial configuration. The model is represented in Figure 18. 

With Eq. (26) and Eq. (37), proposed by Hobbs (1984), Taylor and Gan (1986) 

obtain Eq. (52) for the pipeline deflection, which is dependent on the maximum buckle 

amplitude. The parameter K" used in Eq. (52) is 15.698465.  
 

v =  v?K" £? cos3nx5cos ¤n L2¥ ?
n6x62 + n6L68 + 1¦ (52) 

  

It can be noted from Figure 18 that the pipeline is totally in contact with the 

imperfection in the initial configuration. It can be interpreted as a vertical deviation from the 

idealized lay proposed by Hobbs (1984). The authors, however, consider the problem as stress-

free-when-initially-deformed. The imperfection is idealized to have the same shape of the final 

configuration of the pipeline, but in a smaller scale. Therefore, the shape of the imperfection 



56 

 

can be obtained from Eq. (52) and Eq. (37) substituting the buckle parameters by the 

imperfection parameters. Such substitution results in Eq. (53) and Eq. (54).

v?m = 0.002408 wLmiEI  (54) 
 

Unlike the parameter L, which is unknown, Lm can be found since it is dependent 
on v?m, which is known or is estimated. Therefore, it can be said that v?m Lm?  is unique, that is, it 
represents only one imperfection. 

After exposing the previous expressions, Taylor and Gan (1986) determine, 

using symmetry, the total potential energy related to the final configuration of the pipeline. It 

is indicated in Eq. (55).

Imposing the equilibrium state – Eq. (56), Taylor and Gan (1986) determine the 

relation between the axial force that acts at the buckle and the buckle length. This relation is 

given by Eq. (57), in which R" is given by Eq. (58).

Once analyzed the buckle region, Taylor and Gan (1986) study the slip region to 

determine the relation between the axial force Pm away from the buckle and the axial force P at 
the buckle. The slip length field equation is given by Eq. (59). The corresponding boundary 

conditions are given by Eq. (60), Eq. (61) and Eq. (62).

The compatibility equation at the interface of the slip and buckle regions, 

considering the orientations indicated in Figure 18, can be expressed by Eq. (64), which yields 

to Eq. (65).

From Eq. (64) and Eq. (65), one can see that Pm ? P depends on s and s depends 
on Pm ? P. To solve the problem, for a known parameter v?m Lm?  and several arbitrary values of L from Lm, it is necessary to employ a nonlinear iterative algorithm, for example, Newton-
Raphson method. Using this method, Pm ? P and s can be found. Besides this, through Eq. (57), P and, consequently, Pm can be determined. As it was already reported by Hobbs (1984), the 
results can be summarized, for example, by graphs that relate the temperature rise or the 

pressure variation and the buckle length or the buckle amplitude.  

Based on the data presented in Table 1, numerical results are presented below 

using the formulation proposed by Taylor and Gan (1986). The analyses are made with values 

of v?m Lm?  between 0.003 and 0.010. Besides this, the fully mobilized axial friction coefficient 
was adopted equal to 0.7 and the corresponding axial displacement was adopted equal to 5 mm. 

The results are summarized and compared to those obtained from the formulation of Hobbs

Taylor and Gan (1986) also analyze the lateral buckling. Concerning the lateral 

buckling mode 1, its features are represented in Figure 21.

The analysis of the buckle region can be done in the same way as it is done in 

upheaval buckling. The difference is in the substitution of w by ?Bw in Eq. (54) and Eq. (55), 
since the lateral friction is considered fully mobilized. Therefore, Eq. (52), Eq. (53), Eq. (56), 

Eq. (57) and Eq. (58) remain the same. The analysis of the slip region, in its turn, requires 

modifications in the boundary conditions of Eq. (59). More specifically, Eq. (61) has to be 

modified since there are no vertical concentrated forces at the lift-off points. The new 

expression is given by Eq. (66). 

 

dudx 3L 25? = 3Pm ? P5EA  (66) 
 

With the previous modification in the boundary condition, Eq. (63) and Eq. (65) 

also change. The new expressions are indicated in Eq. (67) and Eq. (68).

The same example presented for the upheaval buckling is presented below 

considering the formulation of the lateral buckling mode 1 proposed by Taylor and Gan (1986). 

The graph that relates the temperature rise and the buckle length is shown in Figure 22. The 

graph that relates the internal pressure and the buckle length, in its turn, is shown in Figure 23.

Concerning the lateral buckling mode 2, the features proposed by Taylor and 

Gan (1986) are represented in Figure 24.

Since the deflection equation changes, the buckle region of the lateral buckling 

mode 2 is analyzed in a different way from the previous modes. For this case, the deflection 

equation is given by Eq. (69). The maximum buckle amplitude, in its turn, is given by Eq. (70) 

and it occurs at x = 0.3464L.

v? = 0.005532 ?BwLiEI  
 

(70) 

 

Using Eq. (69) and Eq. (70), Taylor and Gan (1986) obtain an expression for the 

pipeline deflection that is dependent on the maximum buckle amplitude. This expression is 

given by Eq. (71). The parameter K6 used in Eq. (71) is 8.6211496. 
 

v =  v?K6 ±1 ? cos ?2?xL ? + ?sin ?2?xL ? + 2?
6xL ¤1 ? xL¥² (71) 

 

As occurred in the upheaval buckling, the pipeline is totally in contact with the 

imperfection in the initial configuration and the shape of the imperfection can be obtained by 

Eq. (71) substituting the buckle parameters by the imperfection parameters. Such substitution 

results in Eq. (72) and Eq. (73). 

 

vm =  v?mK6 ±1 ? cos ?2?xLm ? + ?sin ?2?xLm ? + 2?
6xLm ?1 ? xLm?²         0 ? x ? Lm (72) 

 

vm = 0.005532 ?BwLmiEI  (73) 
 

Concerning the total potential energy related to the final configuration, Eq. (55) 

can be used with L 2?  and Lm 2?  being replaced by L and Lm, respectively, since the regions 
under consideration for the deflected pipeline and for the imperfection are 0 ? x ? L and 0 ?x ? Lm, respectively. Besides this, w must be replaced by ?Bw.  

Imposing the equilibrium state – Eq. (56), Taylor and Gan (1986) also determine 

the relation between the axial force that acts at the buckle and the buckle length for the lateral 

buckling mode 2. This relation is given by Eq. (74), in which R6 is given by Eq. (75).

The slip region can be analyzed in the same way as the lateral buckling mode 1 

is analyzed, but the parameters L 2?  and Lm 2?  also have to be replaced by, respectively, L and Lm. Therefore, Eq. (60) and Eq. (67) remain the same and Eq. (62), Eq. (64), Eq. (65) and Eq. 
(66) have to be substituted by Eq. (76), Eq. (77), Eq. (78) and Eq. (79).

The example previously performed for the upheaval buckling and for the lateral 

buckling mode 1 is presented below considering the formulation of the lateral buckling mode 2 

proposed by Taylor and Gan (1986). The graph that relates the temperature rise and the buckle 

length is shown in Figure 25. The graph that relates the internal pressure and the buckle length, 

in its turn, is shown in Figure 26.

The work of Taylor and Gan (1986) concludes that the cases with small 

imperfections have larger critical loads than the cases with large imperfections, but small 

imperfections cause abrupt displacements when the critical load is reached. In Figure 19, for 

example, small imperfections cause the snap-through phenomenon. As the imperfection 

amplitudes increase, the critical loads decrease.

The amount of existing analytical studies related to buckling of pipelines with 

imperfections is quite large since the imperfections can assume many shapes. However, in 

general, the same kind of qualitative conclusions obtained by Taylor and Gan (1986) are 

obtained by other authors. In order not to make the work so extensive, only one more study is 

summarized in order to illustrate another mechanism of buckling of pipelines caused by a 

different type of imperfection. The work chosen to be discussed, Taylor and Tran (1996), is 

reference in the literature, being cited by many other authors. Besides this, it will be the basis 

of comparison for the numerical results of the present work. 

Taylor and Tran (1996) discuss imperfections focusing on the upheaval buckling. 

The authors divide the isolated imperfections that can occur in the vertical plane into three 

different types. The first imperfection is that in which the pipeline is totally in contact with the 

ground, as proposed by Taylor and Gan (1986). The second type, on the other hand, is an 

imperfection that is not totally in contact with the ground. Thus, there are voids between the 

pipeline and the ground. Finally, the third type consists in the second type of imperfection, but, 

in this case, the voids become filled by sand or other materials. The third case can be understood 

as a particular case of the first case. Taylor and Tran (1996) focus on the second type of 

imperfection, called prop imperfection, presenting a mathematical formulation that considers 

the following assumptions: the imperfections are symmetrical, the soil is rigid, the deflections 

are small, the material is elastic-linear and the friction is fully mobilized. 

A prop imperfection is generated by irregularities of the ground, which can be 

provided from natural conditions as, for example, the presence of rocks, or from the 

undercrossing of nonparallel pipelines. Basically, according to Taylor and Tran (1996), the 

upheaval buckling in pipelines that are laid on such prop imperfections has four stages, which 

the authors call: datum establishment, pre-upheaval flexure, upheaval and post-upheaval 

buckling. Each of these stages are summarized below. 

The stage called datum establishment consists in the determination of the initial 

configuration assumed by the pipeline after the laying operations, considering that there is a 

deviation from the idealized lay caused by the prop imperfection. The authors consider that 

such deflected configuration is stress free. In this stage, there is no axial force, since the pipeline 

is still empty. So, the pipeline is only subject to its self-weight and to the force of the prop 

imperfection, which can be understood as an existing reaction at the point where the pipeline 

rests on the imperfection. The topology assumed by the authors is presented in Figure 27, in 

which L? is the initial buckle length of the pipeline caused by the prop imperfection, F? is the 
initial shear force at the prop imperfection, which is half of the total prop force, and N? is the 



67 

 

initial maximum bending moment at the prop imperfection.

imperfection – datum establishment topology.

The bending moment M? on the pipeline, for the datum state, can be obtained by 
Eq. (80). 

 

M? = ?  F?L?2 + wL?68 + F?x ? wx62  (80) 
 

From Eq. (19), the differential equation of the deflected pipeline is given by Eq. 

(81), in which v? is the deflection of the pipeline laid on the prop imperfection and v??? is the 
second derivative of v? with respect to x. 

 

v??? = 1EI Ê?  F?L?2 + wL?68 + F?x ? wx62 Ë (81) 
 

Considering that the deflection, the slope and the curvature are zero at the lift-

off points of the pipeline and that the slope is zero at the midspan, the initial deflection of the 

pipeline is given by Eq. (82). 

 

v? = w72EI ±2L? ?L?2 ? x?I ? 3 ?L?2 ? x?i² (82) 
 

The relation between L? and the maximum vertical amplitude v?? of the prop 



68 

 

imperfection is given by Eq. (83). The force of the prop imperfection 2F?, in its turn, is given 
by Eq. (84). 

 

L? = 5.8259 ?v??EIw ?m.6j (83) 
 

2F? = 2w ±5.8259 ¤
v??EIw ¥m.6j²3  (84) 

 

When the pipeline is filled with oil or gas, a compressive axial force P arises in 
the pipeline and, initially, there is a reduction of L? as such force increases. This reduction 
happens until L? reaches a specific value Lo, for which the pipeline loses its contact with the 
prop imperfection, that is, the prop force becomes zero. The described stage corresponds to the 

called pre-upheaval flexure. Figure 28 illustrates the topology and the axial force distribution 

of this stage, in which N is the maximum bending moment at the prop imperfection. 
The relation between the bending moment M and the curvature of the deflected 

pipeline with prop imperfection can be obtained by Eq. (85).

imperfection – pre-upheaval flexure topology and axial force distribution.

 MEI = v?? ? v??? (85) 
 

The boundary conditions of the Eq. (85) are given by Eq. (86) and Eq. (87). 

 

v ?L2? = v? ?L2? = v?? ?L2? = v?305 = 0 (86) 
 v305 = v?? (87) 
 

 It can be noted that, although the curvature at the lift-off point of the deflected 

pipeline is required to be zero, the bending moment at this point is not zero due to the stress-

free-when-initially-deformed pipeline assumption, which subtracts the product EIv??? from the 
product EIv?? at the lift-off point for obtaining the final bending moment. It can be understood 
by Eq. (88), derived from Eq. (85). 

 

M ?L2? = EIv?? ?L2? ? EIv??? ?L2? = ?EIv??? ?L2? (88) 
 

The bending moment M can be obtained by Eq. (89), in which F is the shear 
force at the prop imperfection. 

 

M = P3v?? ? v5 + N + Fx ? wx62  (89) 
 

Performing manipulations of Eq. (85) with Eq. (82), Eq. (83), Eq. (86), Eq. (87) 

and Eq. (89), the relation between L? L?  and nL is obtained by Eq. (90).

The deflection of the pipeline, in its turn, is given by Eq. (91), in which C", C6, 
and CI are given, respectively, by Eq. (92), Eq. (93) and Eq. (94).

CI = 3nL?5i1152 + 2cos ?nL2 ? ? C"sin ?nL2 ? (94) 
 

Finally, the shear force F at the prop imperfection is given by Eq. (95). 
 

F = wn ¸1 ? cos ¤nL2 ¥¹ È2sin ?
nL2 ? + ?nL?3 ? nL? cos ?nL2 ? ? nL?3 É (95) 

 

The slip region also has to be analyzed to establish the relation between P and Pm. This region can be analyzed in the same way as it is done for the upheaval buckling case of 
the study of Taylor and Gan (1986). The difference is that Taylor and Tran (1996) do not 

consider a deformation-dependent axial friction. With such assumption, Eq. (63) becomes Eq. 

(96). Eq. (64) is still valid. 

 

3Pm ? P5 = ?2??wEA3?s5?m.j + ?? ?w L2 ? F? (96) 
 

For a specific imperfection length L?, the solution for the pre-upheaval flexure 
can be obtained from the determination of the axial displacement s at the lift-off point from Eq. 
(64) and Eq. (96) using a nonlinear iterative algorithm for several values of L from L? to Lo. Lo 
is the buckle length which occurs when F = 0. With s, Pm can be determined. 

The next stage called upheaval by Taylor and Tran (1996) corresponds to the 

instant when the prop force becomes zero, that is, the pipeline loses its contact with the 

imperfection.  It can be demonstrated that such stage occurs when nL = 6.857667 and L? L? =1.3421, if the pipeline is considered stress-free-when-initially-deformed. Therefore, the 
relation between Po, the axial force at the buckle region when F becomes zero, and Lo is given 



71 

 

by Eq. (97). If the pipeline is not considered stress-free-when-initially-deformed, the relation 

between Po and Lo is given by Eq. (98). 
 

Po = 42.027 EI30.7451L?56 (97) 
 

Po = 80.76 EI30.775L?56 (98) 
 

It can be noted that, when the pipeline is considered stress-free-when-initially-

deformed, the axial force necessary to cause upheaval buckling of a pipeline laid on a prop 

imperfection is 63% of the axial force necessary to cause upheaval buckling of an idealized 

pipeline, which is given by Eq. (28). So, as expected, the idealized model is not on the security 

side. 

From the upheaval stage, with the continuous increase of the axial force P by 
temperature and internal pressure, the buckle length starts to increase from Lo. This movement 
is called post-upheaval buckling by the authors and can be subdivided into two stages. The first 

corresponds to the stage in which L &amp;lt;L? and the second corresponds to the stage in which L &gt;L?. For the first case, Figure 29 illustrates the topology and the axial force distribution. 
The relation between the bending moment M and the curvature of the deflected 

pipeline with prop imperfection can be obtained again by Eq. (85) as well as the boundary 

conditions of the Eq. (85) can be obtained by Eq. (86) and Eq. (99). 

 v305 = v?  (99) 
 

The bending moment M can be obtained by Eq. (100). 
 

M = P3v? ? v5 + N ? wx62  (100)

Performing manipulations of Eq. (85) with Eq. (86), Eq. (99) and Eq. (100), the

To establish the relation between P and Pm, the slip length can be analyzed in the 
same way as it is done for the pre-upheaval stage using F = 0 in Eq. (96). Eq. (64) remains the 



73 

 

same. For a specific imperfection length L?, the solution for the post-upheaval buckling stage 
can be obtained in the same way as it is obtained for the pre-upheaval stage using values of L 
from Lo.  

Finally, the last stage that occurs in the upheaval buckling is the post-upheaval 

buckling with L &gt; L?. Figure 30 illustrates the topology and the axial force distribution.

There are two equilibrium conditions. The first is related to the region where 0 ?x ? L? 2? . The bending moment for such condition is given by Eq. (103) with the boundary 
conditions given by Eq. (104). 

 

M = EI3v?? ? v???5 = P3v? ? v5 + N ? wx62  (103) 
 v?305 = 0 and v305 = v? (104) 
 

The second equilibrium condition is related to the region where L? 2? ? x ? L/2. 



74 

 

The bending moment for such condition is given by Eq.(105) with the boundary conditions 

given by Eq. (106). 

 

M = EIv?? = P3v? ? v5 + N ? wx62  (105) 
 

v ?L2? = v? ?L2? = v?? ?L2? = 0 (106) 
 

Performing some manipulations, the previous equations provide the 

characteristic equation presented in Eq. (107). 

 

sin ?nL2 ? ? nL2 cos ?nL2 ? + sin ?nL?2 ? ? nL?6 cos ?nL?2 ? ? nL?3 = 0 (107) 
 

The equations of the deflected curve are given by Eq. (108) and Eq. (109), for 0 ? x ? L? 2?  and L? 2? ? x ? L/2, respectively. 
 v =wEIni ÎÈ? nL2 sin ?nL2 ? ? cos ?nL2 ? ? nL?6 cos ?nL?2 ? ? cos ?nL?2 ?É cos3nx5 ?nL?3 sin3nx5 + 2 + 3nL568 ? 3nL?5624 + n6L?x3 ? n6x6Ï

(109) 

 

Concerning the slip region, Eq. (64) has to be rewritten to include the regions 0 ? Ð ? L? 2?  and L? 2? ? x ? L/2 separetely. Therefore, Eq. (64) becomes Eq. (110). Eq. (96) 
remains the same. For a specific imperfection length L?, the solution for the post-upheaval 
buckling stage can be obtained in the same way as it is obtained for the pre-upheaval stage using 

values of L from L?.

According to Taylor and Tran (1996), who have also performed numerical case 

studies, the results are similar to existing experimental data and, as proposed by Taylor and Gan 

(1986), the imperfections have great influence in the critical load, making it smaller.  

All previous formulations deal with symmetrical buckling. However, the 

existing studies are not restricted to this case. Ballet and Hobbs (1992), for example, propose a 

formulation for the pre-upheaval stage of buckling of pipelines laid on prop imperfections 

which considers that the configuration of the pipeline after the laying process is not symmetric 

with respect to the prop. Although the authors do not show a complete formulation, through 

graphs of temperature rise versus buckle amplitude for a numerical example, Ballet and Hobbs 

(1992) point out that the asymmetrical buckling is possible and that the critical load is smaller 

in the asymmetrical case than in the symmetrical case. Hunt and Blackmore (1997) also study 

the asymmetrical buckling dealing with an imperfection that has the shape of a step. According 

to the authors, this type of imperfection has a greater destabilizing effect than the prop 

imperfection. 

As a result of various existing analytical models for buckling of pipelines with 

imperfection, an interesting aspect to be discussed is how the standards deal with such subject. 

The recommended practice DNV-RP-F110 of Det Norske Veritas (2007), for example, 

proposes three possible global buckling scenarios:  exposed pipelines on even ground, exposed 

pipelines on uneven ground and buried pipelines. The first scenario does not imply that 

imperfections are not considered. The imperfections exist, but only in the horizontal plane, in 

which, by the way, the buckling occurs. In the second scenario, besides the possibility of 

occurrence of lateral imperfections, there are also vertical imperfections. Thus, the global 

deformation occurs first in the vertical plane and, then, in the horizontal plane. Finally, the third 

case is related to buried pipelines which can be subjected to upheaval buckling.  

An important aspect is that the recommended practice does not consider the 

occurrence of buckling as an impediment for the design of pipelines, that is, buckling can occur 

as long as the integrity of the post-buckling configuration is ensured. Such integrity is verified 

through design criteria related to failure modes such as local buckling, fracture and fatigue. For 

the specific case of the recommended practice DNV-RP-F110 of Det Norske Veritas (2007), 

exposed pipelines are designed to buckle in a controlled manner and buried pipelines are 



76 

 

designed not to buckle. Besides this, as information, since the topic does not belong to the scope 

of the research, the recommended practice DNV-RP-F110 of Det Norske Veritas (2007) deals 

only with local buckling. Other failure modes can be found in the offshore standard DNV-OS-

F101 of Det Norske Veritas (2013). 

To verify the susceptibility of global buckling, the recommended practice DNV-

RP-F110 of Det Norske Veritas (2007) establishes that for the first and the third scenarios there 

is the possibility of using the analytical models, as those reviewed in this work. The 

recommended practice also proposes some simplified procedures. However, it recommends that 

analytical procedures are used only at the conceptual design phase, because they have so many 

limitations, such as: elastic-linear material behavior, simplified axial and lateral soil-pipeline 

interaction, small rotation theory and imposed shape of initial and post-buckling configurations 

according to assumed buckling mode, that is, the critical load is related to an assumed buckling 

mode that may differ from the real pipeline as-laid configuration. Therefore, the finite element 

method (FEM) should be used to perform the analyses. It allows, among other things, to model 

nonlinear material behavior, to use large deflection theory and to model soil profiles more 

realistically. The next section describes some researches that have been carried out using 

numerical analyses with FEM. 

 

2.3.2 Numerical analyses 

 

Recent studies, besides analytical analysis, propose numerical analysis. Through 

numerical analysis using FEM, for example, it is possible to simulate more complex and more 

realistic models of pipelines that could not be solved by analytical methods. As mentioned, the 

contact between the pipeline and the soil, for example, can be simulated using arbitrary soil 

profiles. Furthermore, it is possible to simulate nonlinear material properties and use large 

deflection theory (physical and geometrical nonlinearities, respectively).  

Liu et al. (2014), for example, use four numerical simulation methods in finite 

element software ABAQUS to analyze the lateral buckling of pipelines under high 

temperatures. These four methods are separated into two main groups. The first group is related 

to 2D models. These models represent the pipeline through beam elements and the ground 

through a rigid flat surface. Contact elements are created between the pipeline and the ground, 

representing their normal and tangential contacts. The second group, in its turn, is related to 3D 

models. In these models, both the pipeline and the ground are represented by solid elements. 

The contact between the pipeline and the ground occurs in three directions and the constitutive 



77 

 

model for the soil is the Mohr-Coulomb model. Unlike 2D models, 3D models can simulate the 

penetration of the pipeline into the ground, capturing the resulting increase of lateral resistance. 

It is also worth mentioning that both 2D and 3D models use elastic-linear materials and that the 

sequence of load application is the same: first there is the introduction of the initial curved 

configuration of the pipeline to simulate the initial lateral imperfection, then the pipe self-

weight is applied and, finally, the temperature rise is also introduced. 

Each of the previous two groups are simulated using two types of analysis, 

totalizing the four numerical simulation methods used by the authors. The first analysis “[…] 

controls the stable structure displacement and addresses the static equilibrium of the unstable 

response segment in implicit analysis […]” (LIU et al., 2014, p. 64). The second analysis is 

“[…] the acceleration control method in which inertia controls acceleration and addresses the 

steady structure displacement in explicit analysis […]” (LIU et al., 2014, p. 64). 

With the results obtained from the four simulations, such as the pipeline global 

buckling shapes, the buckle amplitudes and the critical temperature rise, for a specific case 

study, Liu et al. (2014) compare them to each other. Besides this, the authors compare the 

results of the 2D implicit model to the results obtained from the analytical model proposed by 

Taylor and Gan (1986). The authors conclude that are some differences between 2D models 

and 3D models. According to the authors, such differences occur because the 3D models 

incorporate the increase of lateral resistance providing from the penetration of the pipeline into 

the soil. With the increase of the lateral resistance, the critical temperatures are larger and the 

buckle amplitudes are smaller than those that occur in 2D models. Comparing the results 

obtained from the implicit and explicit analyses, the results also differ. According to Liu et al. 

(2014), although the critical loads are similar, the explicit analysis considers the influence of 

speed in the buckling phenomenon and part of the work generated by internal forces is 

converted into kinetic energy. In other words, more axial stress is required to attain the same 

deformation amplitude as that attained by the implicit analysis. Finally, concerning the 

comparison between the results of the 2D implicit model and the results obtained from the 

analytical model proposed by Taylor and Gan (1986), some differences occur because the 

analytical model assumes that the final buckled configuration of the pipeline has the same shape 

of the imperfect initial configuration. In the numerical analysis, it can be noted that it does not 

happen. The resulting differences are: the buckle amplitudes are on the security side in the 

analytical model, but the critical temperature, contrary, is not.  

It is clearly shown by the previous work that, depending on the assumptions 

made and on the type analysis chosen, the results may change completely. Thus, the process of 



78 

 

modeling in numerical analysis must be done carefully and in a consistent way with the 

conditions that exist in practice. In general, the representation of pipelines by means of beam 

elements brings significant reduction in the computational cost, when compared to shell/solid 

models. Besides this, depending on the type of analysis required, with more or less details, this 

assumption provides suitable results for the global phenomenon of buckling of pipelines, being 

used by many authors. For local phenomena, however, more complex models can be desirable. 

Continuing in the context of the FEM, for the upheaval case proposed by Taylor 

and Gan (1986), for example, Liu, Wang and Yan (2013), besides analytical formulation, 

develop an elastoplastic analysis for buckling of pipelines using finite element software 

ABAQUSTM. The authors apply such methods in a practical case in China. The study is made 

based on temperature rises that play the role of temperature and pressure increases, jointly. The 

conclusions of the work are similar to those reached by other researches: the critical load 

depends on the imperfection amplitude. Furthermore, for the same imperfection amplitudes, the 

critical load is larger when the covered depth and the soil strength are larger.  

The work of Zeng, Duan and Che (2014), in its turn, simulates, using 

ABAQUSTM, the upheaval buckling of pipelines caused by high temperature for three different 

groups of rigid conformal imperfections. To define the groups, the research considers 

parameters as the imperfection amplitude, the imperfection length and the imperfection shape. 

Based on comparisons between the three groups of imperfection, the authors conclude that 

when the ratio between the imperfection amplitude and the imperfection length increases, 

buckling occurs with smaller critical loads and less abruptly. The same occurs for compacted 

imperfections. The authors also propose approximated formulas, based on the results obtained 

from the numerical analyses, to determine the critical loads for the analyzed imperfections, 

which depend on the ratio between the imperfection amplitude and the imperfection length. 

Zhang and Duan (2015) employ the FEM to study the upheaval buckling and to 

perform similar analysis to Zeng, Duan and Che (2014). The objective of the authors is to 

determine an expression for the critical load, which depends on the ratio between the 

imperfection amplitude and the imperfection length and on the ratio between the curvature of 

the imperfection and the imperfection length. Unlike the formulas proposed by Zeng, Duan and 

Che (2014), which are specific for each of the three imperfection groups analyzed, the formula 

proposed by Zhang and Duan (2015) intends to be universal.  Such formula is presented in Eq. 

(111), in which ?:&lt;= is the maximum value of negative curvature radius of the conformal 
imperfection. 

 



79 

 

P =  ?0.032 Lmv?m ? 2.003 ?:&lt;=Lm + 1.404? 3w6EI5"I (111) 
 

For achieving that, the authors simulate pipelines in software ABAQUSTM with 

eight different conformal imperfection types. For each imperfection type, in its turn, the authors 

simulate pipelines with ten different ratios between the imperfection amplitude and the 

imperfection length. Based on the results and using linear regression, the authors determine Eq. 

(111) for the critical load. Zhang and Duan (2015) concludes that, for the same ratio between 

the curvature of the imperfection and the imperfection length, when the ratio between the 

imperfection amplitude and the imperfection length increases, the critical load decreases. 

Besides this, for the same ratio between the imperfection amplitude and the imperfection length, 

when the ratio between the curvature of the imperfection and the imperfection length increases, 

the critical load decreases. 

Besides studies about the influence of imperfections in the buckling of pipelines, 

there are studies that simulate practical cases of pipelines, applying both temperature and 

pressure loads and modeling the soil profile. In such cases, the objective is usually to know if 

certain pipelines are or not likely to buckle. Isaac (2013), for example, analyzes a specific case 

study with soil-pipeline contact and temperature and pressure loads. The objective is to know 

if the pipeline buckles and what is the best lay configuration that would allow controlling the 

buckling of the pipeline. The author concludes that the snake lay is an option to control the 

lateral buckling. The snake lay triggers buckles at pre-determined locations along the pipeline, 

controlling the global buckling. For the case study, the author determines the best number of 

snakes to share the expansion under thermal and pressure loads. 

With the few studies discussed in the present section, it is possible to exemplify 

the advances provided by the use of FEM. These advances are not only restricted to a more 

realistic modeling of pipelines. The FEM is also a tool that helps to analyze which are the 

parameters, such as the imperfections, in large or small scale, that can influence the global 

buckling of pipelines. The tool also helps in the derivation of practical formulas that can be 

used by the designers. 

 

2.3.3 Contextualization of objectives and methodology 

 

As mentioned in Section 1.1, the general objective of the present work is to 



80 

 

analyze the upheaval instability of pipelines triggered by internal pressure. First of all, it is 

important to say that, given the large number of possible studies on buckling of pipelines, it 

was decided to study only the upheaval case. With respect to the triggering load, in its turn, an 

aspect that is worth to be discussed is that all works exposed previously, both those related to 

analytical and numerical analysis, do not analyze specifically the effects of internal pressure. 

Although they have comments about pressure, Hobbs (1984), Taylor and Gan (1986), Taylor 

and Tran (1996), Ballet and Hobbs (1992), Liu, Wang and Yan (2013), and Zeng, Duan and 

Che (2014), for example, analyze the critical load only in terms of critical temperature rise. Liu, 

Wang and Yan (2013), by the way, consider that part of the temperature rise refers to pressure. 

It is clear that the objective of the works is to determine the magnitude of the critical load 

generically, regardless of the cause of the axial force. The use of the temperature is just a way 

to have some kind of practical measure for the critical load. Pressure could be used, making it 

possible to interpret the order of magnitude of the critical loads in terms of internal pressure. 

Other researches, in their turn, simulate practical cases of pipelines, applying both temperature 

and pressure load. In such cases, the objective is usually to know if certain pipelines are or not 

likely to buckle. So, the focus is not on the triggering load. The work of Isaac (2013) can be 

cited in this context. 

Works that are really concerned with the role of the internal pressure in the 

buckling of pipelines are few. Dvorkin and Toscano (2001), for example, analyze, using the 

finite difference method to determine the pressure load, the global buckling in pipelines that are 

subjected to internal and external pressures, besides compressive axial forces (they can be 

associated with temperature, for example). According to Dvorkin and Toscano (2001), 

imperfect pipelines have a resultant force providing from pressure loads that has a tendency to 

modify the pipe curvature. When internal pressure is larger than external pressure, it results in 

a destabilizing load pointing from the center of curvature and the critical load is smaller than 

the critical load in perfect pipelines. The inverse situation, in its turn, generates a stabilizing 

load and the critical load is larger than the critical load in perfect pipelines. Other qualitative 

conclusion, similar to that obtained by other authors, is that smaller imperfections cause critical 

loads closer to critical loads of perfect pipelines than larger imperfections. 

Given the limited amount of discussion about the internal pressure in the context 

of buckling of pipelines, the general objective of the present work is justified. Using different 

approaches for considering the internal pressure, the simple and advanced numerical 

simulations of the present work allow to discuss the works of Sparks (1984) and Fyrileiv and 

Collberg (2005), which deal with the concept of effective axial force, as well as the work of 



81 

 

Gay Neto, Pimenta and Martins (2017), which deals with a specific formulation for applying 

the internal pressure as a distributed load dependent on pipe curvature. Such formulation, which 

constitutes an advance of the formulation proposed by Dvorkin and Toscano (2001) in the scope 

of finite elements, by the way, will be tested through the practical numerical simulations of the 

present work.  

The influence of the isolated imperfections existing on the ground and of the soil 

friction coefficients in the buckling of pipelines is widely discussed in literature, as presented, 

but not using internal pressure loads. The present work, additionally, also intends to perform a 

relative study about the influence of these two parameters. Such study is benefited by the use 

of geometrically-exact 3D Timoshenko beam elements to represent the pipeline, especially with 

respect to the post-buckling configurations of the pipeline, since large displacements and finite 

rotations are possible. Contact models also contribute to enhance the numerical results. The 

suitable prediction of post-buckling configurations can be important, for example, to study 

possible failure modes resulting from the buckling of pipelines. 

Through the scenario described, it is possible to infer that the objectives of the 

present work are valid and will contribute to the knowledge in the area.

3 STABILITY OF STRUCTURES 

 

As detailed in Section 2, once determined the internal pressure or the equivalent 

axial force acting on the pipeline, it is necessary to know if the pipeline buckles when subjected 

to these loads. Moreover, if the pipe buckles, it is necessary to know what is the magnitude of 

its displacements after the buckling. Clearly, this scenario consists in a stability problem, 

because the focus is on the load for which the pipeline loses the stability of its initial 

configuration and tries to find another stable configuration. For this reason, some aspects of 

stability of structures will be presented in this section. The intention, however, is not to discuss 

stability of structures deeply, but to discuss simple ideas that will be the basis of comparison 

between analytical and numerical solutions in Section 5. Basically, the present work is 

concerned with critical loads and post-buckling configurations. 

Before discussing the topics of structural stability that are of interest to the 

present work, it is appropriate to briefly present the historical development of the basic stability 

theory. Such historical development is presented below, being based on Thompson (1982) and 

Godoy (1999). 

Although there are indications that, for example, the Greeks, between 400 b. C. 

and 200 b. C., carried out investigations on stability of structures, the first significant theoretical 

studies in the area began to arise only in the seventeenth century. In 1686, Isaac Newton (1642-

1727) detailed experimental studies of the motions of a simple pendulum in both air and water. 

This system, with damped oscillations, is an example of an asymptotically stable system. James 

Bernoulli (1654-1705) and Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782), in their turn, may have induced 

Leonard Euler (1707-1783) to study structural stability. This is because, James Bernoulli 

studied the deflection of an elastic rod in bending, concluding that its resistance was provided 

by the extension and the contraction of the longitudinal fibers and that there was a relationship 

between the bending moment and the curvature of the deflected rod. Although James Bernoulli 

and Daniel Bernoulli did not work with stability, the last one suggested to Leonard Euler to 

develop the differential equation of the rod. And it was in this process that, in addition to 

obtaining such differential equation, Leonard Euler, in 1744, with the aid of the variational 

calculus, determined the equilibrium configurations of a compressed elastic column. The study 

of Leonard Euler is considered the first to deal with a bifurcation problem. However, his study 

did not have practical application for a century, because stability was not a problem for the rock 

and timber structures built at that time. Lagrange (1736-1813) also addressed stability of 

structures, developing the analytical energy approach to mechanics, which generated the 



83 

 

fundamental energy theorem that proposes that a minimum of the total potential energy is a 

sufficient condition for stability. The general bifurcation theory arose, then, in the nineteenth 

century, being developed by Henri Poincaré (1854-1912), who also created the global 

qualitative dynamics in which there is also much of stability theory. Lyapunov (1857-1918), in 

his turn, presented, in 1892, a rigorous mathematical definition for stability, besides introducing 

his generalized energy functions. 

According to Thompson (1982), with the advance of science and applied 

mechanics, the original classical development of stability has been fragmented and diversified, 

not being restricted to elastic stability theory. The most recent researches in the area use, among 

others, theoretical, experimental, computational and behavioral approaches to study, for 

example, both critical loads and post-buckling configurations. The subject is quite broad, but 

as already commented, the present work will not present it deeply, since only some basic aspects 

of elastic stability will be necessary herein. Once contextualized the stability of structures, such 

basic aspects will be useful to understand the discussions proposed in Section 5. 

Based on the general concept of stability, a nonperturbed solution of a structure 

(equilibrium or movement) is stable if the distances between it and perturbed solutions remain 

within the established limits for all time and perturbation. Many stability definitions come from 

such concept and may be used to quantify the stability. Although this concept is in a dynamic 

context, the existing methods for analyzing stability problems are not restricted to dynamic 

methods. Ziegler (1968), for instance, discusses four methods to deal with such problems. The 

first method is called imperfection method and consists in analyzing the behavior of imperfect 

structures. The main idea of this method is to determine the load for which the static 

displacements become excessive or infinite (in the linear case). The equilibrium method, the 

second of the four methods discussed by Ziegler (1968), consists in analyzing the equilibrium 

of perfect structures. When the trivial equilibrium position loses its stability, a nontrivial 

equilibrium position appears. With this in mind, the equilibrium method looks for the loads for 

which such perfect structures admit nontrivial equilibrium configurations. The third method, in 

its turn, is based on the potential energy of the system and originated from Lagrange’s studies. 

The transition from stability to instability may occur when the potential energy ceases to be 

positive definite (or ceases to be a point of minimum). According to Bazant and Cedolin (2010), 

the second method represents a part of the third method, however, the second method does not 

answer the question of stability: it gives only equilibrium states, which may be stable or not. It 

is also worth mentioning that all previous methods have the objective of analyzing a static 

nature for the structure base-state. The last method presented by Ziegler (1968), however, is 



84 

 

kinetic and meets the stability concept presented. The called vibration method establishes that, 

in stable systems, small perturbations result in bounded motions in the vicinity of the 

equilibrium position. Thus, the idea of this method is to find the load for which such motions 

become unbounded (here one may also interpret such criterion by Lyapunov’s point of view). 

Ziegler (1968) also shows that both static and dynamic methods provide the 

same critical loads for the Euler’s column buckling problems. However, this conclusion cannot 

be generalized for all systems. A question that arises is when the static and dynamic methods 

should be used. Besides Ziegler (1968), Thompson (1982), Bazant and Cedolin (2010) and Gay 

Neto and Martins (2013) also address the question. To understand the topic, it is fundamental 

to list what types of force can be present in a physical system. In general, the forces can be 

divided into active forces (loads) and reactive forces (reactions). The reactions, in systems 

whose constraints do not depend explicitly on time, can be either nonworking or dissipative. 

The loads, in their turn, can be divided into non-stationary loads, which vary over time, and 

stationary loads, which do not vary over time. The stationary loads can be subdivided into loads 

that depend on velocity and loads that depend on displacement. The loads that depend on 

velocity correspond to dissipative, gyroscopic and impressive loads. Dissipative loads do 

negative work on the system, gyroscopic loads do not do work on the system and impressive 

loads do positive work on the system. The loads which depend on displacement, in their turn, 

correspond to non-circulatory loads (elastic and conservative loads) and circulatory loads. 

Besides the loads that depend on velocity and on displacement, it is also possible to identify the 

inertial effects (resulting from mathematical manipulations given by the D’Alembert’s principle 

and depending on acceleration) and the nonlinearities that can depend on acceleration, velocity 

and displacement.  

Based on such classification of forces and on the works cited previously, it is 

possible to classify the systems and to outline the situations in which static and dynamic 

analyses are valid. Systems with non-stationary loads have to be analyzed by dynamic methods. 

With relation to stationary systems, first of all, it is important to mention that all of them are 

assumed to have inertial effects and dissipative and elastic loads. Therefore, in conservative 

systems, besides the previous loads, there are only conservative loads. In gyroscopic systems, 

there are, besides conservative loads, gyroscopic loads. Impressive systems, in their turn, can 

have impressive and conservative loads. Circulatory systems can have conservative and 

circulatory loads and, finally, gyroscopic circulatory systems can have gyroscopic, conservative 

and circulatory loads. Table 3 shows the classification of physical systems.

It is possible to say that conservative and gyroscopic systems can be analyzed 

by both static and dynamic methods and that impressive, circulatory and gyroscopic circulatory 

systems cannot be analyzed by static methods. Bazant and Cedolin (2010) state that the dynamic 

analysis consists in the fundamental test of stability, but the static analysis can bring useful 

simplifications when it can be used. 

To illustrate the aforementioned discussions, two examples, based on Ziegler 

(1968), are discussed in this section (Figure 31). They consist in prismatic cantilever columns 

with flexural rigidity EI and elastic-linear material behavior. There is also an assumption of 

small strains and small deflections. The first example has a non-follower load P at the free end 

and will be discussed by equilibrium method. The second example has a follower load P at the 

free end and will be discussed by equilibrium and vibration methods. As considered in the 

previous section, the notation (…)’ stands for the derivative with respect to coordinate x.

Starting by the first example and assuming that the eccentricity e is zero, since 
the equilibrium method deals with perfect systems, the linearized equation of the deflection 

curve v and the boundary conditions, with f being the deflection at the free end x = l, are given 
by Eq. (112) and Eq. (113), respectively. 

 EIv?? = P3f ? v5 (112) 
 v 305 = v?305 =  0;  v 3l5 = f (113) 
 

The general solution of Eq. (112) is given by Eq. (114). The boundary 

conditions, in their turn, require that Eq. (115) be satisfied. 

 

v = G"cos ±? PEI?m.j x² + G6sin ±? PEI?m.j x² + f (114) 
 

G"cos ±? PEI?m.j l² = 0  (115) 
 

Thus, the loads P: for which the column admits nontrivial equilibrium positions, 
with m being entire numbers, are given by Eq. (116). 

 

P: = m6?6EI4l6  (116) 
 



87 

 

The same procedure can be done for other boundary conditions in the first 

example. The results are summarized in Table 4.

3 fixed roller P" = ?6EI/30.7l56 
4 fixed free P" = ?6EI/4l6 

Source: adapted from Ziegler (1968). 

 

Using the equilibrium method for the second example, the linearized equation of 

the deflection curve and the boundary conditions are given, respectively, by Eq. (117) and Eq. 

(118). 

 EIv?? = P3v? ? v5 ? Pv??3l ? x5 (117) 
 v 305 =  v?305 =  0; v3l5 =  v?;  v?3l5 = v?? (118) 
 

The general solution of Eq. (117) can be obtained by Eq. (119). 

 

v = G"cos ±? PEI?m.j x² + G6sin ±? PEI?m.j x² ? v??3l ? x5 + v? . (119) 
 

The boundary conditions can be used together with Eq. (119), generating a linear 

and homogeneous system that yields to the nontrivial condition given Eq. (120). 

 

? PEI?m.j Îcos6 ±? PEI?m.j l² + sin6 ±? PEI?m.j l²Ï = ? PEI?m.j = 0 (120) 
 

Eq. (120) indicates that do not exist nontrivial equilibrium configurations when 

P is nonzero and, therefore, the column should not buckle. Of course, it is an unexpected (and 

non-coherent) result. It occurs because the system analyzed is neither conservative nor 

gyroscopic. It is a circulatory system in which the direction of the force depends on the column 

deflection. The column cannot be analyzed by static methods, thus the vibration method has to 

be used.  



88 

 

According to Ziegler (1968), in the kinetic approach, the flexural oscillations of 

the column are investigated. Considering that the inertial load dT is given by Eq. (121) and that ? is the mass per unit length and ? is a generic coordinate x, the differential equation of the 
deflection curve can be given by Eq. (122). The notation 3… 5?  stands for the derivative with 
respect to time and d? is an infinitesimal change of ?. 

 dT = ?v? 3?, t5d? (121) 
 EIv??3x, t5 = 

P?v3l, t5 ? v3x, t5? ? Pv?3l, t53l ? x5 ? ? ª v? 3?, t53? ? x5d??=  
(122) 

 

Differentiating Eq. (122) twice with respect to x, it leads to Eq. (123), whose 

boundary conditions are given by Eq. (124). 

 EIv???? + Pv?? + ?v? = 0 (123) 
 v30, t5 = v?30, t5 = 0;  v??3l, t5 = v???3l, t5 = 0 (124) 
 

A solution can be given by the Eq. (125) and Eq. (126).  

 v3x, t5 = f3x53H"cos?t + H6sin?t5 (125) 
 f3x5 = Je?Ô= (126) 
 

Substituting Eq. (125) into Eq. (123), the characteristic equation results in Eq. 

(127) and, with the roots of Eq. (127), Eq. (126) can be rewritten, resulting in Eq. (128). 

 EI?i ? P?6 ? ??6 = 0  (127) 
 

f3x5 = Õ J?e?ÔÖ=i?×"  (128) 
 

Substituting Eq. (128) into the boundary conditions of Eq. (123), a second 

characteristic equation is found (? is the unknown constant) and it is given by Eq. (129).

(129) 

                                                            

Eq. (129) can be represented by a curve in a ?3? EI5? ?6, 3P EI5l6? ?-plane and 
consists in an infinity of branches. If P increases, the curve can stop to intersect the first branch 
and ?"6 and ?66 become complex, implying in crescent oscillation amplitudes. It can be 
demonstrated that it occurs when the critical load P" is approximately eight times the Euler’s 
load for the case 4 of the Table 4, given by Eq. (130). 

 

P" = 2.031 ?6EIl6  (130) 
 

The two examples were discussed using the assumption of small deflections. The 

Section 5, however, will present numerical examples of pipelines using software Giraffe, which 

performs analyses with geometrical nonlinearities, and the results will be compared. 

Concerning more complex structures, beyond columns, they can be discretized 

with n degrees of freedom to be analyzed. With such discretization, the Lyapunov’s first method 
can also be used to study the kinetic stability of structures, determining when the structure loses 

the stability and which is the instability type, for example, divergence or flutter. The idea of the 

Lyapunov’s first method coincides with that presented for the vibration method: the structure 

loses stability when small perturbations result in unbounded motions in the vicinity of the 

equilibrium position. It is the general concept of stability and the Lyapunov’s first method is a 

way to quantify such concept.  

The differential equations of motion for a system with n degrees of freedom are 
given by Eq. (131) in which t is the mass matrix, P is the damping matrix, k is the stiffness 
matrix, ? is the vector of displacements, ??  is the vector of velocities, ??  is the vector of 
accelerations and Z is the vector of applied forces. 

 t?? + P?? +  k? = Z (131) 
 

For a system without damping and under free vibrations, the differential 

equations of motion can be simplified, being given by Eq. (132). 

 



90 

 t?? + k? = J (132) 
 

It is also possible to transform the second order differential equations of motion 

into first order differential equations. For this, it is necessary to introduce the new variables ?" 
and ?6. The variable ?" is equal to ? and ?6 is the first derivative of  ?" with respect to time 
(??"). It results in Eq. (133), in which ??6 is the first derivative of  ?6 with respect to time. For a 
system without damping and under free vibrations, Eq. (134) can be used. 

 t??6 + P?6 +  k?" = Z              ?6 = ??" (133) 
 t??6 +  k?" = J                          ?6 = ??" (134) 
 

In the present work, only the second order differential equations of motion will 

be considered. So, the form of the solution of Eq. (132) can be given by Eq. (135), in which ??: 
is the mode of the structure, t is the time, ? is the circulatory frequency and i is the imaginary 
number. 

 ? = e?Ô???:  
 

(135) 

Substituting Eq. (135) and its second derivative with respect to time into the Eq. 

(132), it results in Eq. (136), which represents an eigenvalue problem with ? = ?6 being the 
eigenvalue. 

 tÀ"k??: = ?6??: (136) 
 

Therefore, to study the stability of structures and to apply the Lyapunov’s first 

method, it is necessary to evaluate and analyze the eigenvalues ? during the loading process. 
Based on Bazant and Cedolin (2010), in a simplified form, when a real positive value of ? 
decreases, reaches the zero and becomes negative, the instability is characterized by divergence, 

since the exponent of Eq. (135) becomes real, generating unbounded, but not oscillatory, 

motions. When two real positive neighboring values of ? become equal and imaginary values 
of ? arise, the instability is characterized by crescent oscillations, which is called flutter. 

With the previous rules, the Lyapunov’s first method will also be useful in 

Section 5.

4 CONTACT MODELS 

 

The onshore and offshore pipelines used to transport oil and gas from the 

wellheads are laid on the ground. So, the soil-pipeline interaction plays a fundamental role in 

the analysis of pipelines under operation. Such interaction can be simulated by means of contact 

models. So, since the buckling of pipelines is a phenomenon that has to consider the soil-

pipeline interaction, it is important to present some considerations about contact models in the 

present work. The objective of this section is to describe the contact problem and the basic 

methodologies to obtain its solutions, present some lines of research that have been developed 

in the area and present the formulation used to perform the numerical simulations described in 

Section 5. 

 

4.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTACT PROBLEM 

 

The contact mechanics is quite complex and a good way to understand its 

characteristics and methodologies is to consider a very simple example extracted from Wriggers 

(2006), in which a point with mass m is supported by a linear spring with stiffness k. The 
displacement u of the point mass can be restricted by a rigid plane that is at a distance h from 
it (Figure 32). It is worth highlighting that however simple the practical problem may be – even 

for elastic-linear problems with small strains in the context of continuum mechanics – the 

contact problem will always be nonlinear. 

 

Figure 32 – Point mass supported by spring.

The energy ? of the system presented in Figure 32 can be written as a function 
of the displacement u of the point mass, as shown in Eq. (137). 



92 

 ? = 12 ku6 ? mgu (137) 
 

In order not to allow penetrations of the point mass into the rigid plane, a 

restriction to its movement has to be imposed by the inequality shown in Eq. (138), which 
establishes that or there is a gap between the point mass and the rigid plane or such gap is 

closed. This is the general idea of contact models: imposition of constraints to avoid 

penetrations of a body inside another.  

 c = h ? u ? 0 (138) 
 

If there was no restriction to the displacement u, the energy would have a 
minimum value ?:?? at u =  mg k? , computed through the variation given by Eq. (139). 
However, due to Eq. (138), the solution of Eq. (137) is not at the minimum point associated 

with ?:??, but at the minimum point associated with ?:??? , which is the minimum energy within 
the admissible solution space. See Figure 33, extracted from Wriggers (2006), for a better 

understanding.  

 ?? = ku?u ? mg?u = 0 (139) 
 

Figure 33 – Energy of the mass spring system. 

  

Source: Wriggers (2006). 

 

By variation of Eq. (138), one can restrict the virtual displacement ?u at the 
contact constraint, obtaining Eq. (140), which states that ?u can only point in the upward 
direction. 

 



93 

 ?u ? 0 (140) 
 

Since mg is larger than ku in the case of contact, and using Eq. (140) in Eq. 
(139), it yields to the variational inequality given by Eq. (141). 

 ku?u ? mg?u ? 0 (141) 
 

Once the contact between the point mass and the rigid plane is established, a 

reaction force R? arises and has to obey the restriction given by Eq. (142) in order to indicate 
only compressive states or inactive reaction forces.  

 R? ? 0 (142) 
 

The nonlinearity of the contact problem is in the fact that there are two possible 

situations that generate a load-displacement curve that has non-differentiable points. The first 

situation is that in which the spring stiffness is large enough not to allow contact between the 

point mass and the rigid plane. This is represented by the conditions given by Eq. (143). The 

second situation is that in which there is contact between the point mass and the rigid plane and 

it is represented by the conditions given by Eq. (144). Eq. (143) and Eq. (144) can be combined 

in the statement given by Eq. (145), which are known as Hertz–Signorini–Moreau conditions 

in contact mechanics.  

 R? = 0 and c &gt; 0 (143) 
 R? &amp;lt;0 and c =  0 (144) 
 R? ? 0, c ?  0 and R?c = 0 (145) 
 

It is also possible to include friction in the contact between the point mass and 

the rigid plane. For that, consider the system illustrated in Figure 34, in which the point mass 

is in contact with the rigid plane (R? ? 0) and there is a force F, tangential to the plane. ? is 
the friction coefficient.  

 



94

Assuming static equilibrium, the vertical and horizontal equilibrium equations 

are given by Eq. (146) and Eq. (147), respectively, in which R, is the tangential reaction force. 
 R? + mg ? kh = 0 (146) 
 R, = F, (147) 
 

There are several constitutive relations to represent the friction between the point 

mass and the rigid plane. The simplest constitutive relation is the Coulomb’s law, illustrated in 

Figure 35. It establishes two states: the stick state and the sliding state. The stick state is 

characterized by no relative tangential movement between the point mass and the plane. In the 

sliding state, on the other hand, there is a relative displacement u, between them.  
 

Figure 35 – Coulomb’s law. 

  

Source: Wriggers (2006). 

 

The Coulomb’s law provides the inequality given by Eq. (148), which depends 

on the normal and tangential reaction forces. The stick state is given by Eq. (149) and the sliding 



95 

 

state is given by Eq. (150). Again, the conditions can be combined in only one statement, given 

by Eq. (151). 

 f3R?, R,5 = |R,| +  ?R? ? 0 (148) 
 |R,| &amp;lt;? ?R? and u, = 0 (149) 
 |R,| = ? ?R? and u, ? 0 (150) 
 |u,| ?  0 , f ? 0 and |u,|f = 0 (151) 
 

Both normal and tangential inequalities cannot be applied directly to solve the 

contact problem and special methods have to be used to obtain its solution, such as the Lagrange 

multiplier method and the penalty method. Using the normal contact between the point mass 

and the rigid plane as example, these two methods are explained below.  

The idea of the Lagrange multiplier method is to assume that the constraint to 

the displacement of the point mass is active, that is, the conditions given by Eq. (144) are 

satisfied. So, this method adds a term related to the constraint to the energy of the system, 

generating Eq. (152), in which ? is the Lagrange multiplier. From Eq. (145), it is possible to 
deduce that the Lagrange multiplier is equivalent to the reaction force R?. 

 

? = 12 ku6 ? mgu + ?c (152) 
 

The variation of Eq. (152) with respect to u and ? leads to Eq. (153) and Eq. 
(154), respectively. The first expression represents the equilibrium of the point mass, which 

includes the reaction force that appears due to its contact with the rigid plane. The second 

expression, in its turn, states that Eq. (138) is satisfied with u = h. 
 ku?u ? mg?u ? ??u = 0 (153) 
 c?? = 0 (154) 
 

The variation is no longer restricted and it is possible to find ? or R? through Eq. 



96 

 

(155). Eq. (142) also has to be checked in order to discard possible adhesion cases. If the 

condition is not satisfied, it means that the constraint is inactive and, hence, ? is zero and the 
correct solution for the problem is that corresponding to ?:??. 

 ? =  kh ? mg (155) 
 

With respect to the penalty method, unlike the Lagrange multiplier method, for 

an active constraint, it introduces a penalty term into Eq. (137), as shown in Eq. (156). The 

structure of the penalty term is the same as the potential energy of a spring. So, the normal 

penalty parameter ?? can be understood as a spring stiffness in the contact between the point 
mass and the rigid plane. 

 

? = 12 ku6 ? mgu + 12 ??c6      ?? &gt; 0 (156) 
 

The variation of Eq. (156) yields to Eq. (157). Using Eq. (138), the solution of 

Eq. (157) can be given by Eq. (158) and the constraint equation c, in its turn, can be given by 
Eq. (159). 

 ku?u ? mg?u ? ??c?u = 0 (157) 
 

u =  mg + ??hk + ??  (158) 
 

c =  kh ? mgk + ??  (159) 
 

Since mg ? kh when the contact is present, it is possible to say that Eq. (159) 
gives the penetration of the point mass into the rigid plane, that is, the compression of the spring 

that represents the contact. Such penetration depends on the spring stiffness. So, to impose the 

constraint given by Eq. (138), ?? has to tend to infinite.  Again, it is possible to distinguish two 
limiting situations. In the first limiting situation, as mentioned, ?? tends to infinite and, 
therefore, the penetration is very small, which is coherent for active constraints. In the second 

limiting situation, ?? tends to zero, being only valid for inactive constraints. So, a small penalty 



97 

 

parameter for active constraints implies in large penetration into the plane.  

To finalize, the reaction force R? can be found using Eq. (160), which comes 
from Eq. (157). It is possible to see that for values of ?? tending to infinite, Eq. (160) approaches 
to that obtained using the Lagrange multiplier method. 

 

R? =  ??c =  ?? kh ? mgk + ??  (160) 
 

According to Wriggers (2006) both methods have advantages and disadvantages. 

The Lagrange multiplier method, for example, fulfills the constraint equation exactly, but 

requires additional variables. The penalty method, on the other hand, does not require additional 

variables, but implies in non-physical penetrations. For the simple example presented, the use 

of one or another method does not make so much difference. But, for more complex situations, 

it does. So, the choice of the best method to be used depends on the application and on the 

contact model employed.  

It is important to emphasize that the previous examples were important to show 

the general characteristics of the contact problems. The same ideas can be applied, though not 

so easily, to more practical problems, which involve the continuum mechanics and more 

complex constitutive relations for the contact bodies. For that, one can obtain, using virtual 

displacements, the weak form of the problem and the variational inequality due to possible 

contacts. The best strategy to model the contact and obtain the solution, again, depends on the 

specific situation, and there is no consensus on which procedure is the best, as it will be 

commented in Section 4.2. 

 

4.2 BRIEF EXPOSITION OF THE LINES OF RESEARCH ON CONTACT MECHANICS  

 

As mentioned, the example of Section 4.1, although simple, provides the basic 

characteristics of contact mechanics. Obviously, the real contact problems are more complex, 

not involving only point masses, but complex geometries, which can require, for example, a in-

depth knowledge of continuum mechanics. And the difficulties in dealing with contact 

problems, which are essentially nonlinear, are not only related to geometry and its implications. 

Although, in some cases, it is possible to consider linear elasticity with small strains, as, for 

example, in the design of bearings and gears, in many other cases, there is a need to consider 

that the contact bodies undergo large displacements and finite rotations and that their 



98 

 

constitutive equations are inelastic, as for example, in car impact simulations. The dynamic 

effects and the consideration of multiple contact surfaces including self-contact are other 

obstacles in the analysis of contact problems (WRIGGERS, 2006). Due to the complexity of 

contact problems, for most applications, computational numerical methods have been employed 

to study them. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that even the more modern technologies 

cannot encompass all contact problems, making the contact mechanics an area with several 

possible lines of research. It is possible to say that there is still no best contact model to be used 

in practice for all kind of bodies. 

According to Wriggers (2006), it is possible to distinguish some areas in 

computational contact mechanics, which analyze different contact problems. One of them is the 

finite element method (FEM), which can be applied both for problems with small and large 

deformations and both for problems in the elastic and inelastic range. There are also discrete 

element methods (DEM) that are used to study contact problems in which particles come into 

contact. Multibody systems have also been used to study small systems in which it is possible 

to describe the bodies as if they were rigid.  

Concerning the FEM, tool used by the present work to perform the numerical 

simulations of the pipeline, it is possible to appoint some techniques for modelling contact 

problems. According to Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2016), such techniques can be 

grouped into: node to node formulations, node to surface formulations, surface to surface 

formulations and contact involving beam elements. The node to node formulations, as the name 

suggests, establish the contact between nodes. The basis of these formulations can be found in 

the works of Francavilla and Zienkiewicz (1975) and Stadter and Weiss (1979). A gap function 

that measures the distance between the nodes is defined. This function plays the same role of 

the Eq. (138) shown in the previous section. If the penetration is detected, the terms related to 

the contact between the nodes can be included in the weak form of the model. The limitation of 

the node to node formulations is that the nodes that are candidates to come into contact have to 

be pre-established. If these nodes change during the simulation, especially in problems with 

large deformations, such change will not be captured by the formulations.  

With respect to the node to surface formulations, they define a slave point and a 

master surface, assuming a pointwise contact. The point of contact in the master surface can be 

found by a minimum distance optimization problem, being possible to change the point of 

contact in problems with large deformations. According to Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers 

(2016), the limitation of the node to surface formulations is the necessity of solving several 

contact problems, one for each slave point used to represent the surface that was not chosen as 



99 

 

master.  The master surface, in its turn, has to be “[…] parameterized using convective 

coordinates, related to material points on the surface, where contact may take place […]” (GAY 

NETO; PIMENTA; WRIGGERS, 2017, p. 2). The works of Bathe and Chaudhary (1985) and 

Bandeira, Wriggers and Pimenta (2003) can be cited in the context of node to surface 

formulations.  

Unlike the node to surface formulations, which impose the contact constraint 

directly in points, the surface to surface formulations impose the constraint in the weak form 

through, for example, Lagrange multipliers, being more elaborated than the previous. The weak 

form is then integrated on the contact interface area. The inclusion of the contact constraint in 

the weak form is made after the verification of minimum distances between the integration 

points of a surface and another. In this context, the Mortar method can be mentioned as an 

interesting alternative to enforce the contact condition in a weak sense. Puso (2003) and Fischer 

and Wriggers (2005) are examples of researchers that deal with surface to surface formulations. 

Finally, there are specific formulations to address the contact between beam 

elements. The following works deal with the topic: Wriggers and Zavarise (1997) describe a 

frictionless pointwise contact between circular beams without master-slave distinctions; 

Zavarise and Wriggers (2000) generalize the previous for frictional pointwise contacts; Gay 

Neto, Martins and Pimenta (2013) and Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2014), in their turn, 

apply the beam to beam formulation in self-contact scenarios with large twisting. 

The contact model used by the present work to perform the numerical 

simulations of the pipeline is described in Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2013) and Gay 

Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017), consisting in a node to surface formulation. The first 

reference deals specifically with the contact between spheres and rigid and flat surfaces and the 

second generalizes the previous for any nature of surfaces, which is important to simulate the 

contact between the pipeline and the soil imperfections. The next section presents the main 

ideas of such contact model. For the detailed formulation, Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers 

(2017) can be consulted. 

 

4.3 CONTACT MODEL USED IN NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS 

 

The contact model proposed by Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2013) and 

Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017), in the context of finite elements, uses a particular 

node-surface description, in which nodes are the center of spherical surfaces, whose kinematics 

allows to obtain the normal and tangential gaps. Figure 36 presents the geometrical description 



100 

 

of the contact model. As proposed by Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017), the upper-right 

index i refers to a configuration obtained previously. For next configurations to be obtained, 
the upper-right index i + 1 is used. The upper-right index ?, in its turn, indicates quantities that 
relate the configurations i and i + 1. The lower-right index refers to the material point to which 
a certain quantify is referred. For example, %??   refers to the position vector of the material point S at configuration i. The global coordinate system is (O,W", W6,WI). 

 

Figure 36 – Geometrical description of the contact model. 

  

Source: Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017). 

 

From Figure 36, the spherical surface with center S is called slave. This can come 
into contact with another general surface ?, called master. For the present work, for example, 
the centers of the spherical surfaces are rigidly attached to the nodes of the beam finite elements 

used to discretize the pipeline and the radii r of these spherical surfaces are equal to the external 
radius of the pipeline cross section.        

To describe the spherical surface at a certain configuration i, it is necessary to 
find the position of its center %??  and the orientation of the surface, given by the rotation tensor |?, which is associated with the rotation vector ???  of the center of the spherical surface. |? 
can be evaluated using Rodrigues’ rotation parameters. More details can be found in Gay Neto, 

Pimenta and Wriggers (2017).  

Six degrees of freedom are necessary to describe the evolution of the spherical 

surface between configurations i and i + 1. They are represented by the vector Q?	 given by Eq. 
(161), in which ??	 is the vector of displacements of S between configurations i and i + 1 and ??	 is the vector that represents the rotations of S between configurations i and i + 1. 



101 

 

Q?	 = ±??	??	² (161) 
 

The master surface ?, which is candidate to come into contact with the spherical 
surface, is parameterized using the convective coordinates ? and ?. Such coordinates can be 
represented by the vector N =  ?? ??,. The master surface is also dependent on a N-dimensional 
vector QS that contains N values of generalized coordinates, which correspond to the degrees 
of freedom necessary to describe the movement of the master surface in space. Eq. (162) gives 

the parameters on which the master surface is dependent. 

 ? = ?Ý3N, QS5 (162) 
 

In order to encompass all degrees of freedom that may affect the interaction 

between the slave and master surfaces, Eq. (161) can be complemented, generating Q =
ØQ?, QS, Ù,. 

For a specific set of degrees of freedom Q,? it is possible to seek for the 
corresponding convective coordinates N? associated with the minimum distance between S and ?. Considering that the master surface is smooth, the tangent directions  ?? and ?? can always 
be defined and the minimum distance can be found by the orthogonality relations shown in Eq. 

(163).   

 

~ =  Ì?? ? 3%? ? ?5 = 0?? ? 3%? ? ?5 = 0 (163) 
 

In order to find N? = ?? ß ?1 ?,, Eq. (163) can be solved using the Newton-Raphson 
method, which is detailed in Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017). Once found the 

convective coordinates that provide the minimum distance between S and ?, the contact normal 
direction # can be found by Eq. (164). The normal gap function  ? given by Eq. (165), in the 
vector form, can be tested along time-evolution in order to detect penetrations of the slave 

surface into the master surface. It is also possible to define a scalar quantify g? to measure the 
gap, which is given by Eq. (166). 

 



102 

 

# =  Ê ??  ×  ??á??  ×  ??áËN? (164) 
  ? = 3%? ? ?5 ? r# (165) 
 g? = 3%? ? ?5 ? # ? r (166) 
 

In the model proposed by Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017), the contact 

inequalities are enforced by the penalty method. So, in case of penetration, the constraint is 

included in the weak form of the model. Based on Section 4.1, it is possible to define the 

potential energy ? through Eq. (167). It leads to the weak form contribution ??? due to normal 
contact, given by Eq. (168). 

 

? = 12 ?? ? ?  ? (167) 
 ??? = ?? ? ? ? ? (168) 
 

The variation of Eq. (165) leads to Eq. (169). 

 ? ? = 3?%? ? ??5 ? r?# (169) 
 

From the previous expressions, Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017) develop 

mathematically the terms due to normal contact to be included in the whole system’s weak 

form, for nonlinear models. In this context, the authors also develop the expression for the 

tangent operator. The final expressions can be included in a nonlinear finite element solver to 

find the nonlinear solution of the problem. 

Once the normal contact between the slave and master surfaces is established, 

the contact model is also able to evaluate the tangential contact effects. For that, the tangential 

gap function is determined from the kinematics description of the slave and master surfaces. 

The kinematics description is illustrated in Figure 37. 

 

 

 



103 

 

Figure 37 – Kinematics description used to define the tangential gap function.

From Figure 37, it is possible to see two configurations of the system composed 

by the slave surface and the master surface. The first configuration i corresponds to the 
beginning of the contact between the two bodies, in which there is a pointwise contact at  ??N?, Q??. As already presented, N? stands for values of convective coordinates and Q? stands for 
the degrees of freedom of the system, both at configuration i. On the spherical surface, such 
pointwise contact may be located by the position vector ~?, with origin at the center S of the 
spherical surface. The contact normal direction, in its turn, is given by the vector #?.  

When the configuration changes from i to i + 1, the tendency of sliding can be 
quantified by a vector that connects the current and previous material points where the contact 

between the slave surface and the master surface is established. These points can be obtained 

by the projection of S on the master surface. With respect to the master surface, the material 
point at ??N?, Q?? in the configuration i becomes ??N?, Q?!"? in the new configuration i + 1. It 
is clear that the convective coordinates of the previous contact point does not change because 

the point remains the same, but the degrees of freedom of the system change. When sliding 

occurs, the new position of the contact point is given by  ??N?!", Q?!"?.  Since the contact point 
changes, both the convective coordinates and the degrees of freedom of the system change in 

the configuration i + 1.With respect to the spherical surface, the center point S moves ??	 and 
the vector ~? rotates  |?	. The vector ??	 represents the local change in the material points where 
the contact is established on the spherical surface and the vector ?S	  represents the local change 
in the material points where the contact is established on the master surface.  

Based on the previous discussions, Eq. (170), Eq. (171) and Eq. (172) can be 

written:  

 



104 

 ??	 =  ?~? +  ??	 +  ~?!" ? Ø??N?!", Q?!"? ? ??N?, Q?? Ù (170) 
 ?S	 =  ??N?, Q?!"? ? ??N?!", Q?!"? (171) 
 ??	 ? ?S	 =  ?~? +  ??	 +  ~?!" + ??N?, Q?? ? ??N?, Q?!"? (172) 
 

The rotation motion, in its turn, is given by Eq. (173). Besides this, with Eq. 

(174), Eq. (175) can be written. 

 ~?!" =  |?	 ~? (173) 
 ~? =  ?r #? (174) 
 ~?!" ?  ~? =  ?|?	 ? f? ~? = r?f?|?	? #? (175) 
 

Substituting Eq. (175) into Eq. (172), it yields to Eq. (176). 

 ??	 ? ?S	 =  r?f?|?	? #? +  ??	 +  ??N?, Q?? ? ??N?, Q?!"? (176) 
 

The incremental tangential gap, from configuration i to configuration i + 1, is 
defined by Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017) as the difference between ??	 and ?S	 , 
projected in the contact tangent plane at configuration i + 1. It can be defined mathematically 
by Eq. (177), in which #?!" is the contact normal direction at configuration i + 1. 

  ?	 = ???	 ? ?S	 ? ? ???	 ? ?S	 ? ? #?!"#?!" (177) 
 

To propagate the information of the tangential gap of the configuration i to the 
next configuration i + 1, Eq. (178) can be used. It represents the tendency of sliding for a given 
contact pair. The rotation operator |? is necessary to update the direction of the accumulated 
tangential gap, from a global perspective, when both slave and master surfaces experience same 

rigid body motions. More details about |? can be found in Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers 
(2017) and therein references. 

 



105 

  ??!" =  ?	 + |? ??  (178) 
 

The constitutive relation used by Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017) to 

represent the contact tangential behavior is the Coulomb’s law. As shown in Section 4.1, 

through Coulomb’s law, two states may occur: the stick state and the sliding state. So, it is 

necessary to define the maximum friction force possible to occur in the stick state, which is 

given by F:&lt;= = ?R?. In the context of the present model, R? can be given by R? = |??g?|. 
Once determined F:&lt;=, it is necessary to compute the friction force that acts on the interface 
between the surfaces indeed and compare it to F:&lt;=, determining which state is valid: the stick 
state or the sliding state. For that, Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017) use the tangential 

penalty approach, adopting a tangential stiffness ?? for the stick state and, thus, controlling the 
amount of sliding.  

Using the penalty method, the tentative-force F?^_ given by Eq. (179) has to be 
evaluated along the time-evolution. This is the force that is compared to F:&lt;= in order to verify 
if sliding occurs.  

 F?^_ = ?? á ??!"á (179) 
 

If sliding occurs, the evaluation of its amount ?? and its direction ??!" becomes 
necessary. With respect to the amount of sliding, it can be computed by Eq. (180) 

 

if F?^_ &gt; F:&lt;=    ?? = F?^_ ?  F:&lt;=??  if F?^_ &amp;lt;F:&lt;=    ?? = 0 (180) 
 

The sliding tangential gap  ? ?????	  is given by Eq. (181) and the direction of 
sliding ??!" can be obtained by Eq. (182), which uses the current tangential gap direction. 

  ? ?????	  = ????!" (181)

The weak form contributions due to friction are given by Eq. (183) and Eq. (184), 

for the stick and sliding conditions, respectively. 

 ??? ????? = ?? ??!" ? ? ??!" (183) 
 ??? ????? = ????á ??!"á??!"? ? ? ??!" (184) 
 

As it was done for the normal contact, from the previous expressions, Gay Neto, 

Pimenta and Wriggers (2017) develop the contributions due to tangential contact to be included 

in the whole system’s weak form, besides the tangent operator. 

With the contact model proposed by Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017), it 

is also possible to consider contact dissipation effects. They will not be considered in the 

simulations of the pipeline, therefore they will not be described herein. More details are 

available in Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017). 

As mentioned, the node to surface formulation proposed by Gay Neto, Pimenta 

and Wriggers (2017) can be used with any nature of surface. Two types of surface are described 

below. They are used in the numerical simulations of Section 5. 

The first type of surface corresponds to a triangular rigid surface. In the 

simulations of the pipeline, it is used to represent the flat portion of the ground on which the 

pipeline is laid. With A, B, C being the vertices of the triangular surface and %?, %? and %? being 
the position vectors of such vertices, the surface can be parameterized using Eq. (185). 

 

?3?, ?5 =  È? 12 3? + ?5    12 31 + ?5    12 31 + ?5É â
%?%?%? ã (185) 

 

The triangular surface is rigidly attached to a node, called pilot node, which rules 

its movement (translation and rotation). To define the triangular surface in the initial 

configuration is necessary to define the global coordinates of its vertices and of the pilot node. 

Another surface used in the simulations of the pipeline is the oscillatory rigid 

surface, which allows to define wave patterns on a surface, in one or in two directions. It is 

employed to represent the isolated imperfections of the ground.  

The oscillatory rigid surface can be parameterized using Eq. (186), in which  %* 
is the position vector of the pilot node that describes the surface movement (it is also the origin 



107 

 

of the surface herein), | is a rotation matrix that rules the alignment of the surface in space and ?3?, ?5, given by Eq. (187), describes the local geometry of the oscillatory rigid surface. More 
details about the rotation matrix can be found in Gay Neto, Pimenta and Wriggers (2017) and 

Gay Neto (2017). 

 

?3?, ?5 =  %* + | â ???3?, ?5ã (186) 
 ?3?, ?5 = 

A" sin ?2???" + ?"? + A6 sin ?2???6 + ?6? + A"6 sin ?2???" + ?"? sin ?2???6 + ?6? (187) 
 

Finally, the parameters A", A6 and A"6 are amplitudes, the parameters ?" and ?6 
are wave-lengths and the parameters ?" and ?6 are phases. All these parameters have to be 
adjusted to create the geometry of the imperfection desired. The initial directions of ? and ? and 
the coordinates of the pilot node also have to be initially defined.

5 NUMERICAL ANALYSES 

 

The present work aims at analyzing the upheaval buckling of pipelines due to 

internal pressure through computational numerical simulations. For that, software Giraffe was 

chosen to perform the simulations.  

The numerical simulations are divided into two main groups. The first group is 

composed by geometrically-simple models that do not have the commitment to faithfully 

represent the practical problems involving buckling of pipelines. The idea is to discuss possible 

approaches for applying the internal pressure load in the pipeline, besides discussing the 

influence of using static or dynamic analysis to obtain the structural response to these loads. 

These are more theoretical discussions than practical ones. So, these simple models only 

represent the pipeline with pre-established boundary conditions at its ends. The contact between 

the pipeline and the ground is not considered and the imperfections necessary to trigger the 

buckling are applied as concentrated forces. Section 5.2 deals with the first group of numerical 

simulations. 

The second group of numerical simulations, in its turn, besides the pipeline, also 

includes the ground on which the pipeline is laid, considering the contact between them. As a 

first study, the pipeline is laid on a flat ground and the imperfections are imposed as 

concentrated forces. The idea is to have a model comparable to the model of Taylor and Tran 

(1996) in order to verify the one proposed by the present work, having as reference an existing 

analytical model. In the sequence, more sophisticated simulations are performed, using contact 

models to detect soil imperfections modeled with rigid surfaces. The objective of such 

simulations is to, besides verifying the results obtained from the previous simulations in more 

practical cases, analyze the influence of the soil imperfections and the soil friction coefficients 

in the critical load and in the post-buckling configuration of the pipeline. Section 5.3 deals with 

the second group of numerical simulations. 

Before describing the particularities and the results obtained by each group, 

Section 5.1 presents the data and the characteristics common to all simulations. 

  

5.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS 

 

This section presents the general data and assumptions adopted to perform the 

numerical simulations. 

 



109 

 

5.1.1 Material and geometric data 

 

The material and the geometric data of the pipeline are the same in all 

simulations. So, their influence in the buckling of pipelines will not be investigated by the 

present work.  

Regarding the material data, the pipe material is the carbon steel API 5L X80 

specified by American Petroleum Institute (2012), which has yielding strength equal to 552 

MPa, Young’s modulus equal to 200 GPa and specific mass equal to 7850 kg/m3. It was 

assumed that the constitutive equation of the steel follows the Hooke’s law, disregarding any 

nonlinear/plasticity effects. 

With respect to the dimensions of the pipeline cross section, they were chosen 

in such a way that they were compatible with the values found in real pipelines. In practice, in 

order to meet the transport capacity requirement, the initial estimative of the diameter of the 

pipeline cross section depends on hydraulic analyses. Once this capacity is not an information 

readily available, the present work opted to randomly select a diameter used in practice, 

considering that it meets the demand required by a generic reservoir. The standard NBR 15280-

1 (BRAZILIAN ASSOCIATION OF TECHNICAL STANDARDS2, 2009) presents nominal 

diameters ranging from 0.0127 m (0.5 inch) to 1.6256 m (64 inches). The nominal diameters of 

the pipelines operated by Transpetro (2017) in Brazil, in its turn, range from 0.0762 m (3 inches) 

to 1.1684 m (46 inches). In this context, the external diameter of the pipeline chosen to be 

simulated in this work is 0.65 m, which is aproximately equivalent to the 26-inch nominal 

diameter. The thickness of the pipeline wall, in its turn, can be estimated through the nominal 

diameter of the pipeline, the design internal pressure, the admissible stress of the pipe material 

and the installation conditions (BRAZILIAN ASSOCIATION OF TECHNICAL 

STANDARDS, 2009). The minimum thickness required for the 26-inch nominal diameter is 

0.00710 m. In order to consider a gap for this value, the thickness of the pipeline was adopted 

equal to 0.015 m. This value, by the way, is in the range of thicknesses of the pipelines operated 

by Transpetro (2017): 0.0052 m (0.203 inch) to 0.0369 m (1.452 inch). 

 

5.1.2 Geometry modeling 

 

The x-direction of the models corresponds to the pipeline longitudinal axis, the 

                                                 
2 Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas (ABNT) 



110 

 

y-direction corresponds to the vertical direction and the z-direction corresponds to the 

horizontal direction transverse to the pipeline longitudinal axis. 

Concerning the pipeline, it is modeled as a straight line composed by 3-node 

beam elements. Giraffe employs a geometrically-exact 3D Timoshenko beam theory that allows 

the consideration of large displacements and finite rotations. The most important kinematic 

assumption that is made considers that the cross sections are rigid. Details about the formulation 

used in static analyses can be found in Gay Neto, Martins and Pimenta (2013). For the details 

about the formulation used in dynamic analyses, in its turn, the references Gay Neto, Pimenta 

and Wriggers (2014) and Gay Neto (2016) can be consulted. 

With respect to the boundary conditions, Section 5.2 addresses pipelines with 

very simple supports at their ends (Table 4), without the consideration of the contact between 

them and the ground. Section 5.3, on the other hand, uses the contact model described in Section 

4.3 to consider the interaction between the pipeline and the ground (with its imperfection), 

modeled with rigid surfaces. 

 

5.1.3 Load modeling 

 

Besides the pipeline self-weight, only the effect of the internal pressure is 

addressed in the numerical simulations, as the only triggering for buckling. It is considered two-

way. The first approach consists in the application of equivalent compressive axial forces at the 

ends of the pipeline that generate the same effect of the internal pressure, that is, that generate 

the same effective axial force. The relation between both is given by Eq. (18). As the present 

work has the objective to analyze only the internal pressure effects in the buckling of pipelines, 

the term p?A? of such equation can be disregarded. Furthermore, 3D Timoshenko beam 
elements are used to represent the pipelines. These beam elements have the assumption that the 

cross sections are rigid and the Poisson effect is not considered for the pressure load. Besides 

this, the considered pipelines do not have end caps. Therefore, the term T?T could appear only 
due to the action of other external loads, such as axial external forces, which would generate 

non-null true wall force in the pipeline. With such assumptions, Eq. (18) can be simplified, 

generating Eq. (188). Here, a guess of critical compressive force is evaluated by analytical 

models, and always a larger magnitude of loading is set in numerical models, thus leading not 

only to predict buckling, but also post-buckling behavior. Throughout the numerical 

simulations, such axial forces can be applied with follower and non-follower characteristics, as 

it will be shown later. 



111 

 Pm = T?T ? p?A?  (188) 
 

  The second approach, distinctly, consists in considering the pressure as a force 

per unit length Z3?s5 given by the vector expression (GAY NETO; PIMENTA; MARTINS, 
2017) 

 

Z3?s5 = lim???m dZds = 3???r?6 ?  ???r?65 ?  3???r?6 ?  ???r?65 ? ?3s5?3s5 +  ??r?6p?3a?5 ? ?r?6p?3a?5??3s5#3s5, (189) 
 

in which s is the curvilinear abscissa that describes positions along the pipeline length, r? is the 
internal radius of the pipeline, r? is the external radius of the pipeline,   is the gravitational field 
vector, a3s5 is the vector that describes the centroid of the pipeline cross section at an abscissa 
s, ?3s5 is the curvature at such abscissa and ?3s5 and #3s5 are Frenet tangential and normal 
directions, respectively, used to describe the pipeline axis spatial curve. The values p?3a?5 and p?3a?5 represent, respectively, external and internal pressurizations. 

As the effect of the external/internal hydrostatic pressure will not be taken into 

account in present numerical models, neither external pressurization, but only the internal 

pressurization, most of terms of the Eq. (189) can be disregarded, simplifying it to Eq. (190).  

 Z3?s5 = ??r?6p?3a?5?3s5#3s5 (190) 
 

Analyzing Eq. (190), one may see that it represents a load in direction #3s5 – 
characterized by the direction connecting each point at abscissa s to its center of curvature – but 

pointing to the opposite sense from the center of curvature, consisting, therefore, in a 

destabilizing load, which tries to increase the curvature level. Such directions are updated with 

the deformation of the pipeline under loading, characterizing the follower behavior of the 

internal pressure. Eq. (190) is also curvature-dependent, as it can be noted by the presence of 

the parameter ?3s5, which, again, depends on the pipeline deformation. It is worth mentioning 
that the formula was derived for Bernoulli-Euler assumptions and the structural model of the 

present work permits first order shear deformations on beams. However, the properties of the 

pipeline ensure compatibility of formulations, since shear strains are negligible. More in-depth 

discussions can be found in Gay Neto, Pimenta and Martins (2017). 

The numerical simulations can involve both static and dynamic analyses to 



112 

 

investigate the pipeline response to internal pressure, as it will be detailed later. Specifically in 

relation to the dynamic analysis, for the cases in which it is used, in order to avoid exciting any 

natural vibration mode of the structure and to represent a quasi-static behavior of the simulation 

(prior to instability occurrence), the internal pressure or axial force magnitudes are applied 

linearly from zero, at the initial time, to the time that is approximately twenty times the largest 

natural period of the structure (estimate adopted). The scheme of the application of the dynamic 

load can be seen in Figure 38. Damping is not considered and the method used to integrate the 

equations of motion over time is the Newmark’s implicit method, with a time step of 0.01 s and 

parameters ? and ? equal to 0.3 and 0.5, respectively, chosen to minimize the numerical 
damping. More details about the implemented version of the Newmark’s method can be found 

in Gay Neto (2016).

Once the general aspects of the numerical models have been described, the next 

sections deal with their peculiar characteristics, purposes and results.  

 

5.2 GEOMETRICALLY-SIMPLE MODELS 

 

In this section, pipelines with the boundary conditions shown in Table 4, which 

are also illustrated in Figure 39, are simulated using Giraffe. The length of the pipelines is 100 

m and, as commented, the pipelines are represented in the models by a straight line composed 

by a set of 3-node beam elements. The pipelines are discretized with 101 equidistant nodes, 

totaling 50 beam elements, and the boundary conditions are imposed at the first and last nodes 



113 

 

of the straight line.

In the first stage of the numerical analysis, pipelines with the first three boundary 

conditions shown in Figure 39 are simulated statically. The internal pressure load is applied 

three-way, in different simulations. The first approach, named load type a, consists in the 

application of the internal pressure as the distributed load proposed by Gay Neto, Pimenta and 

Martins (2017). For that, it is necessary to specify the value of internal pressure in Giraffe so 

that it performs the distribution of the load along the pipeline. The second approach, named 

load type b, consists in the application of a follower compressive axial force at the second end 

of the pipeline. The third approach, in its turn, named load type c, consists in the previous axial 

force, but with a non-follower behavior. The relation between the load type a and the load types 

b and c is given by Eq. (188). 

The magnitudes of the loads are chosen to be larger than the critical magnitudes 

derived in Section 3, with the objective of capturing the buckling phenomenon and the post-

buckling configuration. Besides this, four different imperfection magnitudes are applied as 

concentrated forces at the pipeline midspan to induce the instability: 100 N, 500 N, 1000 N and 

5000 N. These imperfections act in the vertical direction (y-direction) perpendicular to the 

element axis (x-direction), as illustrated in Figure 39. The displacement in z-direction of all 

pipeline nodes is restricted in order to induce the upheaval buckling. 

The load data for the first three cases of boundary conditions are shown in Table 

5.

Comparing the post-buckling configurations for the various imperfections 

(Figure 43, Figure 45 and Figure 47), it can be implied that, for the cases 1 and 3, the post-

buckling configuration does not change significantly with the increase of the magnitude of the 

imperfections. The difference starts to appear only for the imperfection of 5000 N in both post-

buckling configurations and equilibrium paths. In the case 2, however, the post-buckling 

configuration changes with the imperfections. In this case, for instance, the difference between 

the midspan displacements for the imperfections of 1000 N and 5000 N almost reaches the 

value of 100%. It can also be verified from Figure 43, Figure 45 and Figure 47 the necessity of 

nonlinear analyses to determine the correct final shapes of the deflected pipelines, since the 

displacements and rotations are not small. It is possible to visualize, for instance, the 

longitudinal displacements when these degrees of freedom are free.  

Analyzing the equilibrium paths (Figure 44, Figure 46 and Figure 48), it is 

important to say that the horizontal levels that exist when the internal pressure is zero represent 

the deflections caused by the initial imperfections. Also from the equilibrium paths, the results 

obtained by the authors described in Section 2.3.1 can be visualized qualitatively in terms of 

internal pressure. For small imperfections, the critical internal pressures tend to the critical 

internal pressures obtained for perfect pipelines using the small deflection theory (Table 4). If 

the imperfections increase, the critical internal pressures decrease. The equilibrium paths, 

however, present a smoother stiffness change during the load application and the displacements 

do not change so abruptly. 

The next stage of the numerical analysis consists in applying compressive axial 

forces in the pipelines corresponding to the internal pressures of the previous stage (Table 5). 

These forces are applied as follower and non-follower loads (load type b and load type c, 

respectively). The results are obtained for the imperfection of 1000 N and compared to the 

results obtained from the application of the load type a.

From Figure 49 to Figure 54, it is possible to see that the three load approaches 

provide equivalent critical loads. However, the post-buckling configurations do not coincide 

for all approaches. Only the analyses with load type a and load type b result in the same post-

buckling configurations and equilibrium paths. It happens because the internal pressure has a 

follower behavior, depending on the deflections of the pipeline. The deflections and the 

rotations are not small for the post-buckling deformed configurations. Therefore, the direction 

of the equivalent compressive axial force has to be updated as the pipe deflects to provide the 

same results obtained using the load type a. The only exception is the second case in which the 

three load approaches coincide. It occurs because both pipe ends are unable to rotate. Thus, the 

follower load does not change its direction. 

Once determined and analyzed the equilibrium paths of the three cases of 

boundary conditions, it is interesting to use the Lyapunov’s first method to analyze the stability 

of the pipeline during the load application. For that, it is necessary to determine the eigenvalues 

of the system’s state variable matrix, analyzing their values and signs. As the results of the three 

cases generate similar discussions, only the results of the case 1, with load type a and 

imperfection magnitude of 1000 N, are presented. Figure 55 shows the evolution of the lowest 

eigenvalue during the load application.

From Figure 55, it is possible to see that the whole time-series of the eigenvalue 

is real positive. Therefore, during the application of the load, all equilibrium configurations are 

stable. It does not mean that the buckling does not occur, but that the pipeline, even after the 

buckling occurrence, can find a different equilibrium configuration that is stable. Once there is 

a new equilibrium configuration, the trivial straight configuration loses its stability. So, if it is 

necessary to estimate the load magnitude for which the buckling occurs, one can simulate the 

same problem without imperfections. The results are shown in Figure 56. It can be noted that 

the real positive eigenvalue decreases until zero and becomes negative, featuring the instability 

called divergence (BAZANT; CEDOLIN, 2010). The load for which this transition occurs is 

the critical load for a perfect pipeline, which coincides with the critical internal pressure 

obtained from Figure 44. In other words, the straight configuration, although it is an equilibrium 

configuration since there is no imperfection and the buckling does not occur, becomes unstable. 

If an imperfection is imposed, as presented in Figure 55, the pipeline naturally seeks for another 

equilibrium configuration, which is, in the present case, stable.

The case 4 of Table 4 has not been commented yet. Figure 57 presents the 

pipeline configurations obtained from the application of the four imperfections: 100 N, 500 N, 

1000 N and 5000 N. Besides this, trying to capture the buckling, an internal pressure of 30 MPa 

is applied. This pressure is equivalent to approximately one hundred and twenty times the 

critical load indicated in Table 4. Performing the static analysis, the results obtained are shown 

in Figure 58 and Figure 59.

Analyzing the results, it is possible to see that, initially, the internal pressure has 

an effect that is opposite to the imperfection one. It is coherent since the load nature (follower), 

the boundary conditions and the deflected pipeline generate a resultant that acts in the opposite 

sense of imperfection. It occurs until the pipe curvature reverses, when the deflections change 

their sense. This process should occur cyclically (and dynamically). It can be observed from 

Figure 58 and Figure 59 that if the static analysis is used to perform the simulations, the critical 

internal pressure corresponding to the critical load indicated in Table 4 is not identified. 

Although the applied internal pressure is much larger than the critical internal pressure obtained 

for a perfect pipeline using the small deflection theory, the pipeline does not buckle. It occurs 

because the method of analysis is not compatible with the system proposed. The system 

analyzed is not conservative, but circulatory. Thus, the discussions presented in Section 3 can 

be applied in this case. The correct way to analyze the problem is to use a dynamic approach, 

once the simplification given by the static analysis leads to erroneous results, as previously 

predicted by Ziegler (1968). Therefore, the critical load is not that obtained by the Euler’s 

problem (Table 4) but that obtained by Eq. (130).   

To perform the dynamic analysis, the load is also applied three-way at the free 

end of the pipeline. Load types a, b and c remain the same as those described for the cases 1, 2 

and 3. In order to represent a quasi-static behavior, without relevant excitation to any natural 

vibration mode of the structure, such loads are applied linearly from zero, at the initial time, to 

the values indicated in Table 6, at the time 316 s.

It is possible to observe from Figure 60 that the post-buckling configurations 

present significant differences for the various imperfections. The same analysis that was made 

for cases 1, 2 and 3 may be made again for case 4: the critical load (obtained from the equivalent 

critical time of Figure 61) for pipelines with small imperfections tends to the critical load for 

perfect pipelines – Eq. (130). Besides this, from Figure 61, it can be noted that the instability 

of the system is characterized by crescent oscillation amplitudes (flutter). 

From Figure 62 and Figure 63, it is observed again an equivalence between the 

analyses performed with internal pressure and follower compressive axial force. The problem 

with non-follower compressive axial force presents results totally different since it represents 

another phenomenon (conservative) that does not characterize the internal pressure effects and 

could be analyzed statically. 

One aspect that differentiates the case 4 from the other cases is the instability 

type. In the cases 1, 2 and 3, the instability is characterized by the divergence whereas the 

instability of case 4 is characterized by the flutter (BAZANT; CEDOLIN, 2010).  So, to finalize 

the analyses of the geometrically-simple models, a more accurate analysis of this difference can 

be done by the extraction of the eigenvalues of the system’s state variable matrix and by the 

Lyapunov’s first method. Figure 64 shows the evolution of the two lowest eigenvalues during 

the load application for the case 4, with load type a and imperfection magnitude of 1000 N. It 

is possible to see that the time for which the two real positive eigenvalues become equal and 

imaginary parts appear coincides with the time for which the flutter starts (Figure 65 and Figure 

63, respectively).

5.3 ADVANCED MODELS 

 

This section presents the description and the results of the set of simulations that 

use contact models to represent the interaction between the pipeline and the ground on which it 

is laid. It is intended that the boundary conditions of the models in this section result mainly 

from such interaction and that the end supports are of less relevance for the study of the buckling 

of pipelines. So, here, the length of the pipelines is 1000 m. It is larger than the length of the 

pipelines of the previous simulations in order to distance the buckle region (central region of 

the pipeline) from the pipeline ends and, thus, to avoid possible interferences of them in the 

buckling. The pipelines are discretized with 1001 equidistant nodes, totaling 500 beam 

elements. 

Section 5.3.1 shows a simplified buckling scenario in which, although the 

pipeline is in contact with the soil, the imperfection is imposed as a concentrated force. The aim 

of this section is to perform initial verifications and analyses of the numerical model, having as 

reference the model presented by Taylor and Tran (1996). In the sequence, in Section 5.3.2, the

effects of the imperfections and the friction between the pipeline and the soil are analyzed with 

the aid of more sophisticated simulations, using contact models to also detect isolated 

imperfections present on the ground and modeled with rigid surfaces. The models of Section 

5.3.2 also consolidate the discussions about the approaches for applying the internal pressure 

promoted in Section 5.2. 

 

5.3.1 Models with imperfections imposed as concentrated forces 

 

To simulate the upheaval buckling process proposed by Taylor and Tran (1996), 

the pipeline is disposed straightly at the level of a rigid surface that represents the soil (Figure 

66). Such rigid surface is modeled with the triangular rigid surfaces described in Section 4.3. 

No friction between the pipeline and the soil is considered. The displacement in z-direction of 

all pipeline nodes is restricted in order to induce the upheaval buckling. Besides this, the 

pipeline end nodes are initially fixed to avoid rigid body movements that may occur prior to the 

establishment of the contact between the pipeline and the soil. The pipeline under these 

conditions is then subjected to a sequence of static load steps that represent partially the stages 

of the upheaval buckling proposed by Taylor and Tran (1996) for an imperfection amplitude of 

0.50 m. These load steps are described in Table 7. 

 

Figure 66 – Initial layout of the simplified model – plan view.

From an idealized straight configuration of the pipeline, the load step 1 of the 

static analysis, through the pipeline self-weight and the upward-directed force calculated from 

Eq. (84), establishes the imperfect initial configuration of the pipeline. Assuming that the 

ground is at the level y = 0, Figure 67 presents a comparison between the initial configurations 

obtained analytically and numerically. It is possible to see that the two configurations are almost 

the same. Only some differences near the lift-off points of the buckle region can be noted.

The load step 2 releases the displacement in x-direction of the pipeline end nodes

the restriction to the displacement in y-direction of this node.

through the load step 4. It is worth mentioning that the initial configuration of the pipeline laid 

on the prop imperfection is not stress free in the numerical simulation. Therefore, the best 

expression to estimate the axial force for which the pipeline loses its contact with the 

imperfection is Eq. (98). Under such force, the length of the pipeline that is not in contact with 

the ground is reduced. The comparison between the pipeline configuration resulting from load 

step 1 and the pipeline configuration resulting from load step 4 is shown in Figure 68.

load step 4.

It is expected that, by releasing the displacement in y-direction of the central 

node in load step 5, the pipeline configuration remains the same as the one obtained in load step 

4, because the force calculated from Eq. (98), according to Taylor and Tran (1996), cancels the 

reaction at the point of contact between the pipeline and the imperfection. In other words, by 

releasing the displacement in y-direction of the central node, the tendency of the pipeline to 

move down caused by its self-weight should be compensated by the tendency of the pipeline to 

move up caused by the axial forces applied in load step 4. However, the central node moved 

about 0.02 m down relative to the configuration obtained in load step 4 (Figure 69). This 

difference occurred because the reaction at the central node did not become exactly zero in load 

step 4. That is, the forces applied in load step 4 are slightly larger than those required to cancel 

the force of the prop imperfection, as it can be seen in Figure 70, which shows that the reaction, 

although very close to zero, becomes negative in load step 4. One could expect that eliminating 

such negative reaction, by releasing the displacement in y-direction of the central node, it would 

increase the amplitude y in load step 5, but the opposite occurs (Figure 69). The explanation 

may be found in the interpretation of Eq. (98): with EI fixed, an axial force larger than the

necessary implies in obtaining a smaller buckle length. This is geometrically related to a smaller 

buckle amplitude. This is why the pipeline moves down with the release of the displacement in 

y-direction of the central node of the pipeline: to lead to a smaller buckle length.

At this point, it is already possible to see slightly differences between the 

analytical and numerical approaches. These occur due to both mathematical simplifications and 

differences in the assumptions adopted for the structural analysis. It is important to remember 

that, in general, the analytical models assume many simplifications such as: totally rigid soil 

and linear analysis with small rotations and displacements. The results of the present numerical

model, however, are obtained from geometrically nonlinear analysis and, although the soil is 

represented by a theoretical rigid surface, the penalty assumed for contact enforcement always 

allows some flexibility to the soil, implying small penetrations of the pipeline into it that modify 

the initial configuration of the pipeline if it is compared to the initial configuration obtained 

using the analytical model (Figure 67b). The foundation stiffness k?+?? can be estimated with 
the aid of the normal penalty parameter ?? per node used in the model (1.00 GN/m) and the 
area of influence of the node, given by the multiplication of the distance between nodes d? by 
the pipeline external diameter D?. Using Eq. (191), the k?+?? results in 1.54 GN/m3 for the 
present model, representing a soil with high stiffness. Based on Béton-Kalender (1962 apud 

MORAES, 1976, p. 15), such level of stiffness can already be considered representative of 

rocks. 

 

k?+?? =  ??d?D? (191) 
 

Once the imminence of loss of contact was achieved by the static load steps 

described in Table 7, additional compressive axial forces are applied dynamically at the pipeline 

end nodes in order to obtain post-critical configurations. The dynamic analysis was chosen 

because, mainly due to the boundary conditions, it is difficult to predict if the systems are 

conservative or not in the advanced models of the present work. So, since the dynamic analysis 

is the fundamental test of stability, it eliminates conceptual doubts regarding the system nature 

and the best type of analysis to be employed. The additional forces have magnitude equal to 

2000000 N and are applied in 16 s to generate a quasi-static simulation, as already mentioned. 

Figure 71 relates the axial forces applied to the buckle amplitudes resulting from the application 

of these forces. The graph includes only the load range considered relevant, as well as other 

graphs shown later in this work. 

In order to compare the results of post-buckling configurations obtained from 

the analytical model proposed by Taylor and Tran (1996) and from the numerical model, the 

present work takes as reference the post-buckling configuration at the time 1.2 s (Figure 72), 

which refers to a total compressive axial force of 4822343.81 N (force applied statically plus 

force applied dynamically at the time 1.2 s).  

From Figure 72, it is determined that the buckle length at the time 1.2 s is 

approximately 72 m. With this information and using the post-upheaval buckling formulation 

of Taylor and Tran (1996), described with details in Section 2.3.1.2, to determine the 



131 

 

compressive axial force that corresponds to the specific pipeline configuration shown in Figure 

72, the magnitude 2842042.51 N is reached. Apparently, the value obtained is quite different 

from the value applied in the numerical model. However, the formulation proposed by Taylor 

and Tran (1996) assumes that the initial configuration of the pipeline is stress free. Such 

condition is not the same in the present numerical model. So, in order to compare compatible 

values, it is possible to think that the difference between the upheaval axial forces obtained by 

Eq. (97) and Eq. (98) can be considered as an additional axial force due to the pre-stress effect, 

reaching 4883879.73 N. Comparing this result to the compressive axial force applied in 

numerical model, it can be observed a difference of approximately 1.26%, which is quite 

acceptable, given all the differences between the models. It is possible to say that, for this load 

level, the assumption of small displacements and rotations still provides good results. With the 

increase of the load, the differences become larger, since this assumption is no longer valid.

Comparisons between the pipeline post-buckling configurations obtained using 

Taylor and Tran (1996) and the simplified numerical model presented in this section cannot be 

made directly since the analytical model was described only for stress free initial configurations. 

Unlike the critical load that could be estimated considering the pre-stress effect, modifications 

in the post-upheaval buckling formulation are not straightforward, not being scope of the 

present work. Nevertheless, with the readily available data, it is possible to observe from Figure 

73 that the inclusion or not of the pre-stress interferes considerably not only in the critical load 

but also in the post-buckling configuration of the pipeline, making important its consideration 

when the post-buckling analysis is necessary, as, for example, in the study of failure modes 

resulting from buckling of pipelines.

5.3.2 Models with imperfections represented by rigid surfaces 

 

Once a more simplified version of the present numerical model has been verified 

and compared to an existing analytical model, this section presents advances in the numerical 

model in order to verify the discussions about the approaches for applying the internal pressure 

and to study the influence of the imperfection amplitude and of the friction between the pipeline 

and the soil in upheaval buckling. 

 

5.3.2.1 Approaches for applying the internal pressure and influence of the imperfection 

amplitude in upheaval buckling 

 

To verify the approaches for applying the internal pressure and to discuss the 

influence of the imperfection amplitude in upheaval buckling, numerical simulations are 

employed, in which the isolated imperfection is represented by a rigid surface inserted in the 

middle of a flat rigid surface and under the center of the pipeline. So, the imperfection can be 

detected by the contact model as a region of the soil. The imposition of the imperfection in such 

a way represents a step forward in relation to the model presented in Section 5.3.1, making the 

simulations closer to the mechanisms that occur in reality. This is because, in the simulation of 

Section 5.3.1, the loss of contact between the pipe and the imperfection was imposed manually 

by eliminating the restriction to the displacement in y-direction of the central node when Po is 
reached, which is a procedure based on the analytical formulation proposed by Taylor and Tran 

(1996). That is, it was not possible to “disconnect” the numerical models from the analytical 

models, which is not convenient in practice.  

For modeling the isolated imperfection, it is used the oscillatory rigid surface 

described in Section 4.3. Four imperfection amplitudes are used to perform the simulations: 

0.05 m, 0.25 m, 0.50 m and 1.00 m. These imperfections are modeled with one wave in each 

direction (Figure 74). Besides this, the wave-lengths in each direction are chosen in such a way 

that the pipeline, when released from the level of the imperfection and under the action of its 

self-weight, establishes only one point of contact with the top of the imperfection. It originates 

the afore called prop imperfection and, to obey this condition, the resulting imperfection wave-

lengths are, respectively: 2.5 m, 12.5 m, 25 m and 50 m. The parameters of Eq. (187) assumed 

to create the imperfections are described in Table 8 and Table 9.

At the beginning of the simulation, unlike the simplified model in which the 

pipeline is initially at the ground level, the pipeline is disposed straightly at the level of the top 

of the imperfection. For the first simulations, friction is still not considered and, again, the 

displacement in z-direction of all nodes is restricted and the end nodes are fixed. Figure 75 

illustrates the initial layout of the pipeline.

For establishing the imperfect initial configuration of the pipeline from the initial 

layout, it is necessary to simulate the process of laying the pipeline on the prop imperfection. 

This stage is developed statically through four load steps, which seek to eliminate possible 

numerical problems due to rigid body movement during the laying process. The four load steps 

are described in Table 10. 

 

Table 10 – Static load steps used to simulate the laying process of the pipeline on the ground 

with a prop imperfection.

At the end of the laying process, the imperfect initial configuration of the 

pipeline is established with a reaction at the central node that represents the contact between 

the pipeline and the soil. It is possible to use this reaction as a parameter of comparison between 



136 

 

the present model and the analytical model proposed by Taylor and Tran (1996). For example, 

for the case with imperfection amplitude equal to 0.50 m, the contact force that appears at the 

central node is 143130 N, which differs only in 0.032% from the force applied in load step 1 of 

the model of Section 5.3.1. 

Once the imperfect initial configuration of the pipeline has been established, it 

is subjected dynamically to the internal pressure load. The analysis of the influence of the 

imperfection amplitude in upheaval buckling is made firstly from the results obtained through 

the application of follower compressive axial forces equivalent to the internal pressure at the 

pipeline end nodes. Then, the same type of results is obtained through the application of the 

internal pressure properly speaking, by Eq. (190). As already mentioned, the follower 

compressive axial force was estimated by analytical prediction – Eq. (98), but taking a larger 

value to also capture post-buckling configurations. So, the magnitude chosen is 25000000 N. 

Using Eq. (188), the corresponding internal pressure is approximately 82806942 Pa. 

The graph of the coordinate y of the central node of the pipeline versus the 

follower compressive axial force is shown in Figure 76 for the four ratios between the 

imperfection amplitude and the imperfection wave-length analyzed. The graph presented in 

Figure 77, in its turn, shows the coordinate y of the central node of the pipeline versus the 

internal pressure for the same imperfections. Finally, Figure 78 presents a comparison between 

Figure 76 and Figure 77 in terms of the time of load application, which can be obtained using 

Figure 38.

Through Figure 78, it is possible to observe the equivalence between the 

application of the compressive axial forces and the application of the internal pressure by Eq. 

(190), since Eq. (188) is obeyed. The two approaches provide approximately the same graphs 

of the coordinate y of the pipeline central node versus the load applied. It is important to 

mention that the compressive axial forces have the same follower behavior as the internal 

pressure, in which the direction of the forces depends on the pipeline deflections. For the cases 

shown in the present section, however, in which the buckle region is limited to the central region 

of the pipeline, the follower behavior of the axial forces is not an essential factor for the

coincidence of the results of the two load approaches. It occurs because the axial loads are 

applied at the pipeline ends, so their directions do not change significantly. If the buckle region 

extended over the entire length of the pipeline, the axial force behavior would play a more 

important role for the coincidence of the results. 

Another topic that can be analyzed from Figure 76, Figure 77 and Figure 78 is 

the influence of the imperfection amplitude in the buckling critical load. It is possible to observe 

that larger imperfection amplitudes lead to smaller buckling critical loads, which coincides with 

the previous results of several authors mentioned in Section 2.3. Another aspect that can be 

commented is that the buckling critical load does not change in the same ratio of the 

imperfection amplitude. Besides this, the ratio between the variation of critical load and of 

imperfection amplitude is dependent on the imperfection amplitude. Figure 79 demonstrates 

the nonlinear relationship between the critical loads and the imperfection amplitudes.

Besides the comparisons between the critical loads for different imperfections, 

it is important to present comparisons in terms of post-buckling configurations. It is worth 

mentioning that, although there are analytical studies that present expressions for the deformed 

configuration of the pipeline, comparisons of the shapes of these configurations are not so 

common in those studies. They are necessary to understand how is the pipeline behavior after 

the buckling begins. Figure 80 to Figure 83 present the post-buckling configurations for the 

four imperfections analyzed. Since such configurations are symmetrical, only half of the 

pipeline is presented. It can be observed that, for the same load increase from the buckling 

critical loads, the smallest imperfection amplitude leads to the largest displacements in y-

direction and as the amplitude increases, such displacements tend to stabilize with smaller

thus, more energy is accumulated, resulting in larger and more abrupt displacements.

In Section 5.1.1, it was commented that the numerical simulations of the present 

work assume that the constitutive equation of the steel follows the Hooke’s law. This is a 

limitation of the numerical model since, obviously, this is not always valid in practice, 

depending on the level of stress to which the pipeline is subjected and on the material strength. 

Although the intention of the work is not to address the plastic deformation range of the steel, 

it is important to verify, for the cases studied, even if simplistically, for which level of loading 

the elastic-linear assumption remains valid using the steel API 5L X80. For that, the Von Misses 

criterion is used. 

Figure 84 shows the evolution of the Von Mises stress at the central cross section 

of the pipeline during the application of the internal pressure for the imperfection amplitude 

equal to 0.05 m. For the evaluation of the Von Mises stress by Eq. (17), only the longitudinal 

and hoop stresses (determined from the internal loads of the structure and from Eq. (12), 

respectively) are considered, that is, it is assumed that the pipeline is a thin-walled pipe. It is 

also worth mentioning that always the worst combination of stresses (unfavorable for safety) 

was considered to determine the Von Mises stress. Figure 85, for a visual understanding of the 

limit of the elastic-linear assumption, shows the relationship between the normal stress at the 

central cross section of the pipeline and the coordinate y of its axis. It is possible to see that, 

before the beginning of the pipeline upheaval, the stress exceeds the yielding strength of the 

steel API 5L X80 and, therefore, the elastic-linear assumption is not valid and the pipeline starts 

to have plastic strains.

The same analysis can be done for the other three imperfections. Figure 86 to 

Figure 88 present the results for the imperfection amplitude equal to 0.25 m. It is possible to 

see that the Von Mises stress exceeds the yielding strength of the steel API 5L X80 after the 

pipeline upheaval. For this case, to ensure elastic strains, the internal pressure cannot exceed 

22816573 Pa, which corresponds to the coordinate y of the central cross section of the pipeline 

equal to 0.263 m.

Through the stress analysis, it is possible to observe that, depending on the case, 

the yielding strength of the steel API 5L X80 can be reached before or after the pipeline 

upheaval. For the cases of imperfection of the present work, only the imperfection of 0.05 m 

led to the yielding of the steel before the pipeline upheaval. One explanation for this is in the 

fact that the pipeline with the smallest imperfection buckles with the largest load, generating 

more stress due to the increase of internal pressure, in addition to generating more accentuated 

displacements when the buckling occurs. At the current stage of the research, it is not possible 

to predict if the consideration of the plasticity implies in significant changes in the results of 

the present model. As commented, it does not belong to the scope of the present work, but it 

can be part of a future continuation of it.  

 

5.3.2.2 Pointwise contact versus conformal contact between the pipeline and the imperfection 

 

As mentioned, the shape of the imperfections adopted to perform the simulations 

was chosen in such a way that the imperfect initial configuration of the pipeline had only one 

point of contact with the top of the imperfection, which characterizes the prop imperfection. It 

is worth mentioning that, besides this type of imperfection with a pointwise contact with the 

pipeline, a type of imperfection with a conformal contact also was studied. The results, 

however, were not relevant for the context of this work and, therefore, they will not be presented 

with the same details as it is done for the prop imperfection. Only some considerations and

comparisons are interesting to be made. 

The amplitudes chosen for the study of the conformal imperfections are the same 

as those chosen for the study of the prop imperfections: 0.05 m, 0.25 m, 0.50 m and 1.00 m. To 

transform the prop imperfections into the corresponding conformal imperfections, it is 

necessary to increase the wave-lengths to 280 m, 620 m, 820 m and 990 m, respectively, in such 

a way that the pipeline, after the laying process, is totally in contact with the imperfection. 

Analytical models, as that presented by Taylor and Gan (1986), propose that the shape of the 

imperfect initial configuration of the pipeline, which coincides with the imperfection shape, 

results from a vertical deviation from the idealized straight lay of the pipeline. In present 

numerical models, however, it is not possible to create an imperfection that has the shape of the 

elastic line of the deformed pipeline, because the imperfection follows the shape of the 

oscillatory rigid surface, which requires larger wave-lengths than those presented in the 

analytical models to generate conformal imperfections.  

Comparing the buckling critical loads of the pipelines laid on prop imperfections 

and on conformal imperfections, it can be verified that the last cases have critical loads much 

larger than the first cases. The model with imperfection amplitude of 0.50 m can be used to 

exemplify the order of magnitude of the results obtained. In the case of the pipeline laid on the 

prop imperfection, the buckling critical load, in terms of equivalent compressive axial force, is 

approximately 5.00 MN. In the case of the pipeline laid on the conformal imperfection, in its 

turn, the buckling critical load is approximately 165 MN (400 MN were applied in 16 s in order 

to capture the buckling). It can be noted that the increase of critical load is quite significant, in 

the order of 3200%. 

The explanation for the difference of critical loads can be associated with the 

existing voids between the pipeline and the soil in the case of the prop imperfection and to the 

absence of such voids in the case of the conformal imperfection. The presence of voids allows 

the pipeline inward movement, using energy for the pre-upheaval flexure. In the case of the 

conformal imperfection, however, there is no space for the shortening of the initial wave-length Lm, that is, there is no pre-upheaval flexure. With such condition, the pipeline accumulates 
energy when it tries to compress the imperfection, increasing the buckling critical load. The 

descriptions of the pipeline pre-upheaval stages are presented schematically in Figure 95 and 

Figure 96 for the prop imperfection and for the conformal imperfection, respectively.

Besides the difference between the critical loads, the prop imperfection and the 

conformal imperfection analyzed induce different buckling modes in the pipeline. The buckling 

mode that arises in the prop imperfection case is the first buckling mode characterized by a 

half-wave and that requires the smallest critical load. The arising of this buckling mode starts 

to be outlined in the pre-upheaval flexure that occurs due to the existing voids. The conformal 

imperfection, unlike the previous, has an approximately initial uniform distribution of the 

contact forces due to the continuous contact between the pipeline and the soil. It hinders the 

pre-upheaval flexure of the pipeline, accumulating more energy in the pipeline with the increase 

of the load applied. So, when the buckling occurs, it occurs with a larger critical load and the 

pipeline assumes a higher buckling mode with multiple waves. The difference of buckling 

modes between the two types of imperfection analyzed can be seen schematically in Figure 97 

and Figure 98.

For the prop imperfection case, Figure 99 shows the evolution of the contact 

forces during the application of the dynamic load. It is possible to note that, with the increase 

of the load, there is a decrease of the contact force at the pipeline central node, that is, on the 

top of the imperfection. This decrease is accompanied by the increase of the contact forces at 

the ends of the buckle length. These, by the way, have an inward movement that demonstrates 

the decrease of the buckle length that occurs in pre-upheaval flexure. From the instant that the 

contact force at the central node becomes zero (Figure 99d), the pipeline upheaval starts. It is 

important to emphasize that there are also contact forces in the regions external to the buckle 

length, but these forces have smaller magnitudes than those in the buckle region, not being 

visible in the scale presented in Figure 99.

Figure 100 to Figure 102, in their turn, show the evolution of the contact forces 

during the application of the dynamic load for the conformal imperfection case. It is possible 

to note that, with the increase of the load, the initial uniform distribution of the contact forces 

is modified: there is a decrease of the contact forces at the central region of the imperfection 

and an increase of the contact forces at the end regions of the imperfection. However, there is 

no inward movement, that is, there is no pre-upheaval flexure. Figure 101 and Figure 102 

present details of the central region of the pipeline after the beginning of the upheaval. Since 

the central contact forces that appear after the upheaval are quite large when compared to the 

adjacent forces, the latter do not appear in the scale of Figure 101 and Figure 102. 

The two types of imperfections commented in the present work do not represent 

the infinite types of imperfections that can happen in practice. Other types of imperfection can, 



151 

 

for example, increase or decrease the critical loads presented. Therefore, since the conformal 

imperfection analyzed is more favorable for safety, it will not be dealt with details in the present 

work (from an engineering point of view).

5.3.2.3 Influence of the friction between the pipeline and the soil in upheaval buckling 

 

All previous simulations did not consider friction between the pipeline and the 

soil. Although this condition is not compatible with practical cases, it allowed to analyze 

independently the effects of the type of loading and of the imperfection amplitude in upheaval 

buckling. Once these effects have been analyzed, the friction can be included in the numerical 

model in order to verify its influence in the upheaval buckling of pipelines. For each of the four 

imperfections presented, ten different coefficients of friction are used to perform the 

simulations. These coefficients of friction range from 0.1 to 1.0 with a step of 0.1. 

With respect to the approaches used for applying the internal pressure, only the 

application of the internal pressure with the aid of Eq. (190) can be used directly in the models 

with friction, in order to produce coherent results. This is because, since the friction can act 

over the entire length of the pipeline, only the distributed load of Eq. (190) provides realistic 

scenarios. If axial forces were applied in a concentrated way at the pipeline ends, they would 

have their effects diminished gradually by the friction over the pipeline length. So, depending 

on the pipeline length, the axial forces could be totally annulled by the friction, not allowing 

the buckling of the pipeline. To use axial forces for representing approximately the internal 

pressure effect, it is necessary to determine their magnitude from Eq. (188), incorporating the 

friction effect in the term T?T. Such approach is commented in Bai and Bai (2014). However, 
in the present work, it was chosen to use only the application of the internal pressure by Eq.

(190) in the simulations with friction.  

All stages of loading of the models without friction are maintained in the models 

with friction: the static laying process of the pipeline and the dynamic application of 82806942 

Pa of internal pressure in 16 s. The graphs of the coordinate y of the central node of the pipeline 

versus the internal pressure are shown in Figure 103 to Figure 110 for the four imperfection 

amplitudes.

From the previous graphs, it is possible to observe that larger coefficients of 

friction lead to larger buckling critical loads for all imperfections analyzed. Besides this, for the 

same imperfection amplitude, the influence of the friction in the buckling critical load is greater 

for smaller coefficients of friction and as this coefficient increases, the variations of critical load 

are smaller. It is also possible to observe from the details, comparing the results of different 

imperfection amplitudes, that, although the difference is small, the influence of the friction in 

the buckling critical load is greater for larger imperfection amplitudes.

It is possible to observe that, for the same load increase from the buckling critical 

loads, the post-buckling configurations are practically the same, with few variations. It means 

that the variation of friction influences only the buckling critical loads, not significantly 

influencing the evolution of the post-buckling configurations from the pipeline upheaval.

6 DISCUSSIONS 

 

The literature review presented in Section 2 gathered the basic concepts and the 

main researches that have been developed in the area of buckling of pipelines as a whole. The 

concept of effective axial force was addressed with details, since it is, from a global point of 

view, the fundamental parameter to understand the effects of the pressure in pipelines and why 

they can buckle under the action of the pressure load. Analytical and numerical studies related 

to the buckling of pipelines itself were also presented in order to describe the mechanism of 

buckling and the parameters that can influence it, especially with regard to the buckling critical 

load. Such studies played a fundamental role in the elaboration and understanding of the 

numerical models developed by the present work. The study of Taylor and Tran (1996), for 

example, which addresses the buckling of pipelines laid on prop imperfections, was the basis 

of comparison for the numerical results.  

Through the works analyzed, it was possible to verify that the buckling 

phenomenon that occurs in HPHT pipelines is quite complex and depends on many variables, 

such as: the pipeline geometry, the pipeline material, the process of laying the pipeline on the 

soil, the pipeline layout on the soil, the load that acts on the pipeline, the soil profile and its 

imperfections, the soil properties, the adoption of buckling mitigating measures, etc. So, with 

this initial contextualization of the subject, it was possible to delimit the scope of the present 

work, identifying the gaps that it sought to fill. Considering the small number of studies that 

deal exclusively with the internal pressure load in the context of buckling of pipelines, the 

general objective of the present work was to analyze the upheaval instability of pipelines 

triggered by the internal pressure, studying basically three parameters that can affect the 

phenomenon: the application of the internal pressure, the soil prop imperfections and the 

friction between the pipeline and the soil. The discussions promoted here were based on the 

results obtained from numerical models developed in Giraffe, having, as mentioned, the support 

of the analytical studies. The numerical models, unlike the analytical ones, considered large 

displacements and finite rotations. The assumptions of rigid soil (when it was modeled) and 

elastic-linear behavior of the pipeline material, in their turn, were maintained.  

Being the focus of the work, the internal pressure was applied in two different 

ways in the numerical simulations. The first approach consisted in the application of an 

equivalent compressive axial force that produced the same effective axial force as that produced 

by the internal pressure. So, this axial force was not obtained by the integration of the stresses 

on the pipeline cross section, as could be done, for example, to determine the effect of the

temperature load. The consideration of the axial force was made from Eq. (188), based on 

Sparks (1984) and Fyrileiv and Collberg (2005). Besides this, both follower and non-follower 

behaviors of the axial force were addressed in the analyses. The second approach for applying 

the internal pressure was equivalent to the integration of the internal pressure on the internal 

area of the pipeline. It is worth mentioning, however, that Eq. (190) was used as a distributed 

load dependent on pipeline curvature and equivalent to internal pressure action, following the 

results obtained by Gay Neto, Pimenta and Martins (2017), which is especially advantageous 

for computation purposes. 

Concerning the numerical simulations, they were divided into two groups, which 

were basically differentiated by their objectives and by the boundary conditions of the pipelines 

simulated in Giraffe. The first group, presented in Section 5.2, consisted in geometrically-

simple models that represented only the pipeline, through Timoshenko beam elements, with 

different boundary conditions at the pipeline ends, but with no consideration of the interaction 

between the pipeline and the soil. The objective of such models was to discuss the mechanisms 

for modelling and analyzing the buckling phenomenon. In other words, the intention of the 

models of Section 5.2 was to verify and discuss the equivalence between the aforementioned 

approaches for considering the internal pressure, besides discussing two methods for obtaining 

the structural response to the internal pressure: static and dynamic analyses. It is clearly a 

numerical application of the theoretical discussions about stability of structures made in Section 

3.  

The effect of imperfections in the instability of pipelines subjected to internal 

pressure was also analyzed in Section 5.2 in terms of post-buckling configurations and 

equilibrium paths/time-series of displacement. In general, the conclusion, corroborating the 

results of the researches presented in Section 2, is that, for small imperfections, the critical 

internal pressures tend to the critical internal pressures obtained analytically for perfect 

pipelines. If the imperfections increase, the critical internal pressures decrease. With regard to 

the equivalence between the approaches of application of internal pressure, the conclusion is 

that, applying the internal pressure as internal pressure properly speaking or applying the 

internal pressure as an equivalent follower compressive axial force, the results generated are 

the same both for post-buckling configurations and equilibrium paths/time-series of 

displacement.  

The conclusions presented for the analyses of Section 5.2 apply both for the 

results obtained from static and dynamic analyses, if such methods of analysis are employed 

properly, that is, if the methods of analysis are compatible with the physical systems analyzed. 



161 

 

It is possible to say that the system nature depends on the boundary conditions and the load 

approaches. So, in general, the static analysis can be employed for conservative systems while 

the dynamic analysis can also be employed for non-conservative systems as, for instance, 

circulatory systems (case 4 of Section 5.2).  

The models described in Section 5.2 did not have the purpose of reproducing the 

operational conditions of real pipelines. This fact is clearly visible due to the boundary 

conditions imposed in the four cases analyzed, which restrain the movements only of the ends 

of the pipelines and ignore the restriction caused by the soil over their length. Thus, the 

simulations performed are not compatible, and cannot be compared in quantitative terms of 

forces and displacements, with the results shown in Section 2. The main idea of the 

geometrically-simple models, at such point of the research, was to understand and analyze the 

role of the internal pressure in the global behavior of the structure concerning buckling, not 

worrying about other more complex influences. The best way for reaching this objective was 

to use known problems (Euler’s columns) and apply the internal pressure, comparing the results 

obtained from the action of this pressure with the results obtained from the action of an 

equivalent axial force. As commented, this procedure allowed to draw conclusions about the 

best way to apply the axial force with the objective of reproducing the global effects of the 

internal pressure concerning the critical load and the post-buckling configuration. The 

discussion about the nature of the axial force required, by the way, a greater knowledge about 

stability of structures since, depending on how the load is applied and depending on the 

boundary conditions, the choice by a static or a dynamic analysis to evaluate the buckling may 

lead to results completely different. The stability of the pipeline, by the way, was also discussed 

in terms of the Lyapunov’s first method, differentiating two types of instability: the divergence 

and the flutter. 

The second group of simulations, presented in Section 5.3, involved more 

realistic models, in which the interaction between the pipeline and the soil was addressed. The 

objective of these models was to analyze the influence of the prop imperfection amplitude and 

of the friction between the pipeline and the soil in the buckling critical load and in the post-

buckling configuration of the pipeline, besides validating the formulation proposed by Gay 

Neto, Pimenta and Martins (2017), summarized by Eq. (190), in more complex models. This 

second group was divided into two subgroups of models. The first subgroup, which included a 

more simplified model with the imperfection represented by a vertical concentrated force, had 

the objective of verifying if the order of magnitude of the analytical results proposed by Taylor 

and Tran (1996) could be confirmed numerically in the model used. This verification proved 



162 

 

the compatibility of the results. In the second subgroup, in its turn, the imperfection is modeled 

together with the flat ground, being possible to detect it by the contact model described in 

Section 4.3. This subgroup allowed, in fact, to analyze the influence of the prop imperfection 

amplitude and of the friction between the pipeline and the soil in upheaval buckling. As an extra 

discussion, the work presented interesting comparisons between the buckling that occurs in the 

presence of pointwise imperfections and the buckling that occurs in the presence of conformal 

imperfections, concluding that the latter are more favorable from an engineering point of view. 

Concerning the validation of the equivalence between the follower axial force 

and the internal pressure, the two load approaches produced compression in the pipeline and 

led to the buckling with the same critical loads, inducing even the same post-buckling 

configurations. Therefore, the equivalence between the two load approaches for the buckling 

analysis is clearly evident. Such equivalence can be very useful in simpler and quicker analysis 

such as, for example, in those without friction, in which the use of the axial force can be made 

directly. The axial force can also be used in cases with friction, provided its consideration is 

included in Eq. (188), as proposed by Bai and Bai (2014). However, as the intention was to take 

the advantage of the numerical analysis and to make the study of the buckling more general, 

once the equivalence between the two load approaches has been proved, it was decided to apply 

the internal pressure provided by Eq. (190) in the simulations with friction, which also 

represents more accurately the action of the load on the pipeline.  

Through the numerical analysis, it was observed again, as expected, a 

dependence between the amplitude of the prop imperfection and the buckling critical load: 

larger amplitudes generate smaller critical loads than smaller amplitudes. It was shown, by the 

way, that this dependence is nonlinear (Figure 79). It is important to emphasize again that all 

numerical analyses were geometrically nonlinear, considering large displacements and finite 

rotations, unlike the existing analytical models. It allowed to study the post-buckling 

configurations in a more coherent way. It was verified that the imperfection amplitude interferes 

in such post-buckling configurations: the same increase of load from the critical load, for the 

cases analyzed, generated the largest vertical displacements for the smallest imperfection 

studied. With the increase of the imperfection amplitude, such displacements were smaller and 

varied little from imperfection to imperfection. With respect to the influence of the friction, it 

can be concluded that its increase delays the onset of the buckling and that its influence 

decreases with the increase of the coefficient of friction, for a given imperfection amplitude. 

Besides this, for the cases studied, the friction had little influence, comparing to the influence 

of the imperfection amplitude, in the post-buckling configurations, when the pressure was 



163 

 

increased from the critical load. It is worth mentioning that the assumption of elastic-linear 

behavior of the steel used in the pipeline was not confirmed for all cases, being necessary 

analyses involving the plastic range of the steel for verifying possible differences in the results. 

In general, it was possible to confirm many results obtained by previous authors. 

This is because, whenever possible, the present work sought to compare its numerical results 

to the results obtained by Taylor and Tran (1996), making the necessary adaptations. A 

difference of the present work compared to the other works is the causative load of the buckling 

that, as mentioned, was the internal pressure. The isolated application of this load and the 

presenting of the results in terms of pressure, as well as the comparison between the different 

approaches for applying such load in the sphere of buckling, do not have much previous 

discussion. The use of an enhanced numerical model for this aim can also be counted as novelty. 

Such formulations, as, for example, that proposed by Gay Neto, Pimenta and Martins (2017), 

by the way, had their applicability and efficiency proved.

7 CONCLUSIONS 

 

The present work discussed the upheaval buckling phenomenon that occurs in 

pipelines considering the internal pressure separately, as the only triggering for buckling. 

Through the research, some conclusions were obtained, which are summarized below: 

 

a)  there is an equivalence between applying the internal pressure as a distributed load 

that is dependent on pipeline curvature (GAY NETO; PIMENTA; MARTINS, 2017) and as a 

follower compressive axial force, both in terms of critical loads and post-buckling 

configurations; 

b)  the numerical models proved the applicability of the formulation proposed by Gay 

Neto, Pimenta and Martins (2017) in a real context, obtaining results coherent with previous 

analytical models; 

c)  the use of static or dynamic analysis to study buckling depends on the nature of the 

physical system; 

d) as predicted by previous works, the critical load decreases with the increase of the 

prop imperfection amplitude and increases with the increase of the coefficient of friction 

between the pipeline and the soil; 

e)  the enhanced numerical model employed in the simulations allowed to predict 

suitably the post-buckling configurations, since large displacements and finite rotations were 

considered, which can be very important to study the failure modes resulting from buckling; 

f)  besides some results known in the literature, it is possible to say that the imperfection 

amplitudes analyzed played a more important role in the post-buckling configurations of the 

pipeline than the friction between the pipeline and the soil; 

g)  the prop imperfections induced smaller critical loads than the conformal 

imperfections analyzed. 

 

The subject of the present work has a wide range of possible future researches. 

It is possible to replicate the study for the lateral buckling or even simulate numerically the 

choice of the type of buckling, that is, verify which type naturally occurs. Advanced 

considerations about the soil deformability, as well as the inclusion of multiple imperfections, 

are also worth of investigation. The assumption of plasticity for the constitutive equation of the 

steel used in the pipeline can be included in the models in order to verify if there are significant 

modifications in the results obtained herein for higher levels of loading. Finally, with respect 



165 

 

to the loads, the external and internal hydrostatic pressures can be included. Such consideration 

can be important in subsea pipelines.
