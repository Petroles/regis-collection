Resumo
Devido à progressiva industrialização e desenvolvimento global tem-se assistido a um aumento das necessidades energéticas do mundo. Com o crescimento das novas potências económicas as previsões apontam para que esta tendência se acentue, aumentando até 51 % entre 2010 e 2035. A combustão de petróleo e dos seus derivados é a principal fonte de energia a nível mundial, representando 34% do total, por isso não é de admirar que no mesmo período as previsões apontem para que também se verifique um aumento tanto no consumo (~20%) como na produção do petróleo (~7%) (OPEC, 2011). No entanto, é um facto conhecido que o petróleo, como os restantes combustíveis fósseis, é uma fonte de energia não renovável, e ao ritmo a que está a ser consumido as suas reservas deverão durar pouco mais de 80 anos (OPEC, 2011). Visto que num futuro próximo os biocombustíveis não parecem vir a ser um substituto válido para os combustíveis fósseis (Achten et al., 2008, Stephen et al., 2010), as empresas petrolíferas estão obrigadas a procurar alternativas, nomeadamente através da utilização de crudes mais pesados. Estes crudes, que anteriormente eram descartados, são caracterizados por uma maior viscosidade e concentração de compostos indesejados, como metais pesados ou compostos de enxofre. Uma vez que as reservas em crudes pesados representam mais do dobro relativamente às reservas convencionais (Javadli and Klerk, 2012), as empresas petrolíferas vêm-nos como uma possível opção a médio-longo prazo para a indústria petrolífera.
Durante a combustão do petróleo e dos seus derivados libertam-se para a atmosfera uma grande variedade de substâncias poluentes, entre as quais se destacam os compostos de enxofre, como óxidos de enxofre, por exemplo o SO2, e metal-sulfatos sob a forma de partículas de pequenas dimensões. Estes compostos são responsáveis por muitos problemas: o SO2 quando em elevadas concentrações provoca irritação bronquial e desencadeia ataques de asma. Alem disso, a exposição prolongada às partículas de enxofre representa um factor de risco importante associado à mortalidade por doenças cardiopulmonares ou por cancro do pulmão (Pope et al., 2002; Mohebali et al., 2008). Por outro lado a oxidação dos compostos de enxofre na atmosfera leva à formação de um aerossol de ácido sulfúrico, que contribui para a formação de chuvas ácidas (Bender and Weigel, 2011) e para o alargamento do buraco na camada de ozono (Denis, 2010)
Assim, e uma vez que, no seu conjunto, a gasolina, o gasóleo e outros combustíveis representam 75 a 80 % dos produtos das refinarias (Babich and Moulijn, 2003), o mundo tem visto na regulação dos seus teores de enxofre uma maneira eficaz de controlar as suas emissões e limitar os seus efeitos adversos (Mohebali and Ball, 2008). Em vários países tem-se assistido ao surgimento de limites legais cada vez mais restritos, reduzindo as concentrações de enxofre nos combustíveis. Nos Estados Unidos da América, por exemplo, verificou-se a redução do limite máximo de 3400 ppm em 2003 para 30 ppm em 2010 para todos os combustíveis refinados, com limites mais apertados para a gasolina e o gasóleo. Na União Europeia, desde 2009, também se tem verificado uma restrição na legislação, com o estabelecimento de um limite máximo de 10 ppm de enxofre para a gasolina e o gasóleo (OPEC, 2011).
Para responder a este problema e remover de forma eficaz o enxofre contido no petróleo, nas últimas décadas têm sido desenvolvidas várias técnicas. Entre elas, aquela que é mais conhecida e amplamente
usada pela indústria petrolífera é a hidrodessulfurização (HDS). Este é um processo catalítico que, resumidamente, se caracteriza por conjugar pressões e temperaturas elevadas (entre 150 a 3000 psi e 290 e 455 °C respectivamente), na presença de catalisadores metálicos, para fazer reagir hidrogénio gasoso com o enxofre contido no petróleo e assim formar gás sulfídrico (H2S) que é facilmente removido (Nikkolaj et al., 2000; Whitehurst et al., 1998; Shafi and Hutchings, 2000; Javadli and Klerk, 2012). Esta técnica apresenta no entanto uma grande limitação: não é eficaz na remoção do enxofre presente nos compostos aromáticos mais complexos, como os derivados do dibenzotiofeno (DBT), muito abundantes nos crudes mais pesados. Estes compostos apresentam uma estrutura molecular que protege o átomo de enxofre e dificulta a reacção com o hidrogénio, tornando-se numa grande barreira à obtenção de combustíveis com os níveis de enxofre exigidos por lei a partir dos crudes pesados (Grossman et al., 2001; Javadli and Klerk, 2012; Chen et al., 2009; Monticello, 2000; Onaka etal., 2001).
Para dessulfurizar esses compostos, a indústria recorre ao agravamento das condições usadas anteriormente (HDS profunda), aplicando o tratamento por mais tempo, a pressões e temperaturas superiores (Reichmuth et al., 2000), com novos e mais complexos catalisadores (Klein et al., 1999; Dolbear and Skov, 2000; Abotsi and Scaroni, 1989). No entanto, com o intensificar de condições, surgiram vários problemas, como o aumento dos custos da dessulfurização (Grossman et al., 2001, McFarland, 1999), o aumento da poluição (Singh et al., 2012) e ainda, em casos mais extremos, uma redução da qualidade do combustível, que devido às condições demasiado restringentes sofre uma redução no número de octanas (Reichmuth et al., 2000; Javadli and Klerk, 2012; Dolbear and Skov, 2000).
Estes problemas levaram a que surgisse a necessidade de desenvolver técnicas alternativas ou complementares para remoção do enxofre. Uma delas é a biodessulfurização (BDS), que se caracteriza por permitir, através da utilização de microrganismos, alcançar a dessulfurização dos compostos mais recalcitrantes à HDS, sem a necessidade de pressões ou temperaturas elevadas, nem de hidrogénio ou catalisadores metálicos (Reichmuth et al., 2000, Mohebali and Ball, 2008; Caro et al., 2007). Isto torna todo o processo mais fácil, com menor impacto ambiental e mais barato, com alguns estudos a indicar uma redução do capital inicial para metade e uma diminuição de 15 % dos custos operacionais (Pacheco et al., 1999; Linguist and Pacheco 1999; Kaufman et al., 1998)
Nos estudos de BDS o composto mais usado é o DBT (Bressler and Fedorak, 2001) por ser abundante nos crudes, ser difícil de dessulfurizar pelos métodos normais (Borgne and Quintero, 2003) e por ser relativamente fácil de manipular (Kropp and Fedorak, 1998; Alves, 2007).
A biodessulfurização pode ocorrer através de vias anaeróbicas ou aeróbicas. No entanto, a que apresenta maior potencial é uma via aeróbica designada 4S. Esta via caracteriza-se por promover a remoção do enxofre do DBT através de uma série de processos oxidativos, convertendo-o em 2-hidroxibifenil (2-HBP) (Nomura et al., 2005) sem que haja destruição do esqueleto de carbono, o que se traduz na manutenção da maior parte do potencial energético do combustível (Wang and Krawiec, 1996).
No entanto este processo apresenta algumas limitações que têm impedido a sua aplicação industrial. Uma delas é, por exemplo, a inibição da BDS do DBT na presença de sulfatos ou outras fontes de enxofre de acesso fácil. Alguns estudos demonstraram que bastam pequenas concentrações de sulfatos para se inibir completamente a dessulfurização (Kim et al., 2004; Mohebali et al., 2008). E isto obriga a que se usem meios com concentrações nulas ou residuais de sulfatos quando se cultivam os microrganismos.
Outro problema é o custo do processo, que apesar de ser mais barato do que a HDS profunda, não deixa de ser um processo algo dispendioso, recaindo uma grande parte dos custos (entre 30 a 40 % do total) sobre o meio de cultura (Ma et al., 2006). Assim para tornar este processo mais atractivo é necessário procurar alternativas mais baratas, como por exemplo o uso de fontes de carbono resultantes de resíduos agro-industriais, desperdícios ou plantas de cultivo fácil (Alves et al., 2008) Nessa categoria, há muitos produtos com capacidades para serem usados como fontes de carbono alternativas, como por exemplo a polpa de alfarroba (Ceratonia siliqua L.), que é um resíduo resultante do processamento das sementes de alfarrobeira, aquando da extracção da goma. Esta polpa caracteriza-se por ser extremamente rica em açúcares como sacarose, glucose e frutose (50 % (g/v)), sendo facilmente utilizada para produzir xaropes ricos em açúcar (Manso et al., 2010) já testados com sucesso no crescimento microbiano (Carvalheiro et al., 2011; Mendes et al., 2007; Sanchez-Segado etal., 2012).
Outro possível exemplo de uma fonte alternativa são os frutos do medronheiro (Arbutus unedo) os medronhos. Os medronheiros são arbustos bastante abundantes em Portugal, mas cujo aproveitamento é ainda algo limitado, havendo muito desperdício. Os seus frutos caracterizam-se por apresentarem elevadas concentrações de açúcares (42 a 50% g/v), com 60 % frutose e 40 % glucose (Ayaz et al., 2000; Alarcão-E-Silva etal., 2001) e, quando maduros, são facilmente macerados, permitindo fazer sumos altamente ricos em açúcar com provas dadas como fontes de carbono para o crescimento microbiano (Santo et al., 2012).
Uma outra possível fonte de carbono são os tubérculos de tupinambo (Helianthus tuberosus). Esta planta, cultivada em todo o mundo, caracteriza-se por ter teores elevados de açúcares, sob a forma de inulina. A inulina é um polissacárido formado por uma cadeia de frutose com ligações p (2 ^1) em que, uma molécula de glucose está ligada a cada extremidade através de uma ligação a (1	2). Esta planta é resistente à seca,
ao gelo, a parasitas, a doenças, aos solos salinos e não necessita de grandes quantidades de fertilizantes (Zhao, 2011), sendo por isso muitas vezes utilizada na recuperação de solos em áreas desertificadas (Cheng, 2009). Estas características fazem do tupinambo uma fonte de carbono atractiva tendo também já sido testado com sucesso no crescimento microbiano (Gencheva et al., 2012, Cheng et al., 2009, Liang et al., 2012)
O uso destas fontes alternativas para a BDS tem no entanto um inconveniente, que se prende com o facto de estas apresentarem concentrações consideráveis de sulfatos (Frazer, 1935; Werther et al., 2000). Portanto, para impedir que ocorra inibição da dessulfurização, torna-se importante removê-los. Um dos métodos mais comuns de remoção de sulfatos baseia-se na utilização de bário sobe a forma de BaCl2 para precipitar os sulfatos (Jegadeesan etal., 2005). Quando em solução, o cloreto de bário dissocia-se, permitindo que o bário
se ligue aos sulfatos formando BaSO4. Este apresenta uma baixa solubilidade (0.00285 g/L a 30 °C) e portanto precipita sendo facilmente removido (Guo etal., 2009).
Dentro dos microrganismos conhecidos pelo seu potencial para a biodessulfurização pode destacar-se o género Gordonia (Kim et al., 1999, 2000; Mohebali et al., 2007a). Este apresenta já várias espécies descritas como capazes de dessulfurizar o DBT pela via 4S, como por exemplo Gordonia sp. estirpe CYKS1 (Rhee et al., 1998), Gordonia desulfuricans, Gordonia nitida e Gordonia alkanivorans (Shavandi et al., 2009, 2010; Mohebali etal., 2007a, 2007b, 2008; Alves etal., 2004).
O género Gordonia (Goodfellow and Alderson, 1977) enquadra-se na ordem dos Actinomycetales, subordem Corynebacterineae e caracteriza-se por englobar microrganismos aeróbicos, com presença de catalase, gram-variáveis a gram-positivos, não formadores de esporos. De acordo com o NCBI, até Agosto de 2012 estavam descritas 32 espécies de Gordonia. Estas foram isoladas dos mais variados tipos de ambientes: da rizosfera do solo, de poços de petróleo, de solos contaminados com hidrocarbonetos, de bio-reactores de tratamento de águas residuais ou até de cadáveres. Apesar de algumas espécies de Gordonia serem patogénicos oportunistas como G. bronchialis (Sng et al., 2004) e G. araii (Jannat-Khah et al., 2009), na sua maioria o género é conhecido pelas suas características de bio-remedição e biodegradação dos mais variados compostos (Arenskotter et al., 2004), bem como pela produção de biosurfactantes, carotenóides e “Gordonano” um polissacárido que induz agregação celular (De los Reyes et al., 1998a, 1998b, De Miguel et al., 2001, Kondo etal., 2000)
Este trabalho centra-se na bactéria Gordonia alkanivorans estirpe 1B, que foi isolada a partir de amostras de solo recolhidas dos terrenos contaminados de hidrocarbonetos na área da EXPO-98 (Lisboa, Portugal) (Alves et al., 2004). Quando cultivada em meio mínimo sem sulfatos, com glucose como única fonte de carbono, esta estirpe foi capaz de dessulfurizar o DBT, reduzindo-o de 478 para 168 pM em 120 h, o que corresponde a uma taxa especifica de dessulfurização de 1.03 pmol de DBT/ (g peso seco/h) (Alves et al., 2004).
Uma fonte de carbono alternativa rica em glucose foi também testada anteriormente com sucesso. Usando hidrolisados de lamas de papel reciclado como única fonte de carbono obtiveram-se valores de dessulfurização e crescimento superiores aos observados em glucose, com o consumo de 250 pM de DBT em 96 h correspondendo a uma produtividade especifica de 2-HBP de 1.1 pmol/ (g (peso seco) /h) e um pmax de 0.035 h- , claramente superior ao obtido com glucose (0.019 h-) (Alves etal., 2008).
Mais recentemente esta estirpe foi descrita como sendo frutofílica (Alves and Paixão, 2011) o que significa que consome preferencialmente frutose e não a glucose, crescendo e dessulfurizando mais depressa quando a frutose é a única fonte de carbono. Assim, este trabalho tenta tirar proveito dessa característica metabólica para explorar novas fontes de carbono alternativas ricas em frutose e determinar qual a melhor para a biodessulfurização realizada pela estirpe G. alkanivorans 1B.
Uma vez que os dados relativos à frutofilia são escassos, foi necessário fazer uma comparação entre os rendimentos em biomassa relativo ao crescimento com glucose e aqueles obtidos com frutose. Assim foram realizados crescimentos da estirpe G. alkanivorans 1B, em frasco agitado, com 25 g/l de glucose ou frutose, com 400 pM de DBT. Usando a glucose como fonte de carbono, a estirpe 1B alcançou a fase estacionária ao fim de 287 h com uma taxa especifica máxima de crescimento (pmax) de 0.030 h- . Com frutose o crescimento
1
bacteriano atingiu o valor máximo entre as 117 e 161 h e uma pmax de 0.070 h- .
Para avaliar a capacidade de biodessulfurização, foi analisada a produção de 2-HBP. Durante o crescimento em glucose a estirpe 1B produziu 306 pM de 2-HBP em 312 h com o consumo total do DBT. Assim, em média foram produzidos 12 pmol de 2-HBP por cada grama de açúcar consumido e a taxa específica máxima
-1 -1
de produção de 2-HBP (q2-HBP) foi de 1.19 pmol g- (peso seco) h- . No crescimento em frutose a concentração máxima de 2-HBP (393 pM) foi atingida em 89 h sem o consumo completo da fonte de carbono (sobrando 2 g/l de frutose) e com o desaparecimento completo do DBT. Isto traduz-se numa q2-HBP de 6.565
-1 -1
pmol g- (peso seco) h- com a produção de 17 pmol de 2-HBP por cada grama de frutose consumida. Estes resultados confirmam os resultados obtidos por Alves &amp;amp; Paixão (2011), ou seja, confirmam que esta estirpe é frutofílica. Nas condições testadas, verificámos um aumento da taxa de crescimento quando a estirpe 1B foi cultivada com frutose como fonte de carbono, obteve-se um aumento na taxa de produção de 2-HBP por grama de açúcar e houve um aumento na taxa específica máxima de dessulfurização que atingiu um valor
5.5	vezes superior ao obtido em glucose.
No estudo de potenciais fontes de carbono alternativas, foram seleccionados produtos com concentrações elevadas de frutose, como a polpa de alfarroba (40 % frutose), os medronhos (60 %) e os tubérculos de tupinambo (80%). Partindo destas fontes foram elaborados sumos e xaropes ricos em açúcares, que foram posteriormente optimizados para a biodessulfurização através de uma hidrólise ácida e da remoção dos sulfatos neles contidos.
Comparando os teores de açúcar entre as fontes não tratadas, verificou-se que o xarope de alfarroba apresentou a concentração de açúcares totais mais elevada (339g/l), mas também a menor percentagem de frutose (19%), sendo que aproximadamente 51 % dos seus açúcares se encontravam sob a forma de sacarose (constituída por 50 % de frutose) O sumo de medronho apresentou 173 g/l de açúcares, dos quais 67% eram frutose, e o sumo de tupinambo foi o que apresentou menor conteúdo em açúcares totais (~22g/l) dos quais ~52 % são frutose (não estando contabilizadas as mais de 120 g/l de inulina presentes no sumo).
Analisando o teor de sulfatos do xarope e dos sumos não tratados verificou-se que, como esperado, todos apresentavam quantidades detectáveis: o xarope de alfarroba ~49 mg/l, o sumo de medronho ~41 mg/l e o sumo de tupinambo apresentou os valores mais elevados, ~451 mg/l.
Assim, antes de prosseguir com o estudo destas fontes de carbono alternativas foi fundamental testar o efeito inibitório dos sulfatos na dessulfurização do DBT pela estirpe 1B. Usando 10 g/l de frutose como fonte de carbono e concentrações progressivamente mais elevadas de sulfatos, determinou-se o efeito inibitório na
dessulfurização avaliando a produção de 2-HBP. Analisando os resultados verificou-se que, nestas condições, até concentrações reduzidas de sulfatos (6 mg/l) provocam algum efeito inibitório (22,4 %) e que 60 mg/l são suficientes para provocar a inibição completa. Por fim o IC50 às 72 h para a inibição da dessulfurização pelos sulfatos foi estimado em 13,6 ± 0,6 mg/l, um valor diferente do determinado por Mohebali e colaboradores (2008), que observaram inibição total da biodessulfurização de uma estirpe de Gordonia alkanivorans com 14,4 mg/l de sulfato; no entanto esta observação foi feita em condições diferentes e com uma estirpe diferente de G. alkanivorans.
Estes resultados reafirmam que, para termos uma dessulfurização eficaz, são necessárias concentrações baixas de sulfatos e, tendo em conta os valores registados nas fontes de carbono alternativas, surge a necessidade de reduzir as concentrações nelas presentes. Para tal foram realizados testes preliminares para a remoção dos sulfatos com o cloreto de bário. Estes revelaram ser necessária uma temperatura de pelo menos 30 °C para que a precipitação ocorra de forma eficaz. Partindo desses resultados procedeu-se à optimização dos tratamentos através de um planeamento experimental seguindo uma distribuição de dois factores, fazendo variar a concentração de BaCl2, o tempo de exposição ao BaCl2 ou o pH a que ocorre a reacção, para o xarope de alfarroba e para o sumo de tupinambo. As condições óptimas para a remoção de sulfatos da alfarroba foram 0,4 % (w/v) BaCl2 durante 36 h a 30 °C (Silva et al., in press), e do tupinambo foram 0,5% (w/v) BaCl2 durante 36 h a 30 °C e pH 8,73.
Quando se utiliza o xarope de alfarroba como fonte de carbono no crescimento com G. alkanivorans estirpe 1B, com 25 g/l de açúcares totais, há um efeito inibitório do crescimento celular. Independentemente dos tratamentos a que foi sujeito, sempre que a estirpe foi cultivada com este xarope, houve uma paragem prematura do crescimento antes que se desse o consumo completo quer da fonte de carbono quer da fonte de enxofre (DBT). O xarope de alfarroba não tratado e não hidrolisado permitiu ainda assim alcançar uma pmax de 0.1099 h- . No entanto, devido aos sulfatos e outras fontes de enxofre presentes no meio, a produção de 2-HBP foi de apenas 50 pM em 93 h com uma q2-HBP de 0,43 pmol g- (peso seco) h- ■ Nas condições óptimas para dessulfurização os resultados foram melhores e apesar de ter havido uma redução na pmax para
-1 -1
0.0595 h- a produção de 2-HBP alcançou os 117 pM em 70 h, com uma q2-HBP de 1,56 pmol g- (peso seco) -1
h- , resultando na produção de 8 pmol de 2-HBP por grama de açúcar consumido. Comparando os resultados que se obtiveram utilizando os diferentes xaropes, verifica-se que os tratamentos tiveram um efeito positivo, levando a um aumento da biodessulfurização, ainda que o efeito inibitório se mantivesse.
O sumo de medronho revelou-se impossível de dessulfurizar pelo método de precipitação dos sulfatos por adição de cloreto de bário. Quando se adiciona BaCl2 ao sumo, este reage, aumentando gradualmente a sua viscosidade, até que, em poucas horas, acaba por se converter numa geleia bastante sólida, o que o torna inútil como fonte de carbono para este género de ensaios. Por outro lado, mesmo sem ser tratado, este sumo mostrou ter outro inconveniente, no decorrer do crescimento, se for usado com uma concentração de 25 g/l de açúcares totais, este sumo leva a que ocorra uma queda abrupta do pH do meio, de valores superiores a 6 para valores de aproximadamente 3. Isto vai provocar um choque ácido e a morte da cultura microbiana antes do consumo total da fonte de carbono. Assim para ultrapassar este problema, foi necessário reduzir a
concentração de sumo de medronho para 10g/l de açúcares totais, mantendo os 400 pM de DBT. Isto permitiu que o crescimento decorresse de forma normal com o consumo total da fonte de carbono, apresentando uma pmax de 0.0469 h- e uma produção de 146 pM 2-HBP em 94 h com uma q2-HBP de 5 pmol
1 1
g- (peso seco) h- e uma produção media de 15 pmol de 2-HBP por grama de açúcar.
De entre as fontes de carbono alternativas testadas, aquela em que os resultados mais beneficiaram com a optimização dos tratamentos foi o sumo de tupinambo. Quando este foi usado como fonte de carbono, na sua forma não tratada e não hidrolisada, com uma concentração equivalente a 25 g/l de açúcares redutores, permitiu que a estirpe G. alkanivorans 1B crescesse ate uma densidade óptica de 4,72 (a 600 nm), com uma
-1
pmax de 0,0546 h- sem que ocorresse qualquer produção de 2-HBP. Uma hidrólise acida deste sumo permitiu converter a inulina em frutose e glucose e isto resultou numa maior concentração de açúcares disponíveis para a bacteria, que e incapaz de consumir inulina. Assim, quando o sumo hidrolisado foi utilizado como fonte de carbono (a 25 g/l de açúcares totais) a bacteria conseguiu atingir não só um crescimento maximo superior
-1
(13,15 de absorvancia a 600 nm), com tambem uma pmax mais acentuada (0,0816 h-). No entanto, as elevadas concentrações de sulfatos causaram a total inibição da dessulfurização, não tendo sido registada qualquer produção de 2-HBP. Para superar este problema foi necessário recorrer à conjugação da hidrólise acida com o tratamento optimizado com BaCl2 para desta forma, remover os sulfatos. Utilizando o sumo de tupinambo tratado e hidrolisado (a 25 g/l de açúcares totais) não se verificaram quaisquer efeitos inibitórios e
-1
a estirpe G. alkanivorans 1B atingiu um maximo de absorvancia de 15 (a 600 nm) com uma pmax de 0,06 h- . Para alem do mais, ate ao fim do crescimento ocorreu o consumo completo da fonte de carbono e, ao contrário do observado com as restantes fontes alternativas, deu-se o consumo total da fonte de enxofre em apenas 96 h. Ou seja, nestas condições foi possível dessulfurizar 400 pM de DBT em 400 pM de 2-HBP com
-1	-1
uma q2-HBP de 5,06 pmol g- (peso seco) h- resultando numa media de 16 pmol de 2-HBP por grama de açúcar.
Como alternativa ao tratamento por hidrólise ácida, para converter a inulina e permitir que o crescimento da estirpe G. alkanivorans 1B, e tambem possível recorrer à acção enzimática, com o auxílio de inulinases, enzimas que degradam especificamente a inulina em frutose e glucose. Assim, foi testado o potencial de um extracto enzimático Talf1 (Paixão et al., 2012) num processo de sacarificação e fermentação simultanea (SSF) para a biodessulfurização com a bacteria. Após se ter obtido resultados positivos com a inulina pura, progrediu-se para a aplicação no sumo de tupinambo não tratado e como tambem este revelou resultados positivos, prosseguiu-se finalmente para o sumo de tupinambo submetido ao tratamento óptimo com BaCl2 mas não hidrolisado. Assim a estirpe G. alkanivorans 1B foi cultivada com ~10 g/l de açúcares totais provenientes do tupinambo e suplementada pela adição de 5 % (v/v) de extracto enzimático Talf1. A análise destes resultados mostrou que ocorreu um melhoramento considerável de todos os parametros analisados,

nomeadamente no crescimento microbiano, tendo sido atingida uma maior pmax (0,1288 h-) e na maior -1 -1
produção de 2-hidroxibifenil, com uma q2-HBP de 8,33 pmol g-1 (peso seco) h-1, e numa produção de 28 pmol de 2-HBP por grama de açúcar consumido.
Da análise global deste estudo pode concluir-se que a estirpe G. alkanivorans 1B foi capaz de crescer e dessulfurizar com as três fontes de carbono alternativas. No entanto, o sumo de tupinambo, depois de optimizado, mostrou ser a melhor alternativa, permitindo valores de crescimento microbiano e produção de 2-HBP semelhantes ou mesmo superiores aos obtidos com frutose comercial. O tupinambo é uma fonte barata e fácil de obter ou cultivar e que apresenta boa potencialidade para a biodessulfurização utilizando a estirpe G. alkanivorans 1B, abrindo assim caminho a que, no futuro, possa contribuir para uma redução dos custos associados ao processo da biodessulfurização de crude.

Abstract
Biodesulfurization of fossil fuels still presents limitations that hinder its industrial application. One is the cost of the culture media formulation for the production of biocatalysts. Another is related to the levels of sulfates in the medium, which provoke the inhibition of desulfurization even in small concentrations.
In this context, the goal of this work was to test different agro-industrial materials and assess the biodesulfurization ability of G. alkanivorans strain 1B. Knowing that this bacterium is fructophilic, only fructose rich alternative carbon sources were selected. Thus, carob pulp, strawberry tree fruits (STF) and Jerusalem artichoke tubers were used to produce sugar-rich liquors and juices, which were optimized through acidic hydrolysis and sulfate removal with BaCl2. The treatments proved successful in improving desulfurization with two carbon sources, but not with STF juice. This juice reacted adversely to BaCl2 and pH changes, so only lower concentrations allowed normal cellular growth and 2-HBP production, which achieved 146 pM in 94 h with a maximum specific productivity (q2-HBP) of 5.00 pmol g- (dry cell weight) h- . Carob pulp liquor revealed inhibitory effects, causing cellular growth to stop before full consumption of either sugars or DBT. Even with
-1 -1
optimal biodesulfurization conditions, q2-HBP was only of 1.56 pmol g- (DCW) h- . Jerusalem artichoke juice (JAJ) proved to be the best source for biodesulfurization. When hydrolyzed, treated with BaCl2 and with 25 g/l total sugars, JAJ allowed the complete conversion of 400 pM DBT into 2-HBP in 73- 96 h with a q2-HBP of 5.06
-1 -1
pmol g- (DCW) h- . When treated and non-hydrolyzed, JAJ was used in a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation with 5 % (v/v) Talf1 enzyme extract (inulinases), the results were improved, resulting in the
-1 -1
highest q2-HBP (8.33 pmol g- (DCW) h-). These results highlight the great potential of JAJ as a cheaper alternative carbon source for biodesulfurization.

1.	INTRODUCTION
1.1	World energy status
In recent years there has been an increase of the world's energy demands, which, according to long term previsions, should continue to rise by 51 % between 2010 and 2035 (OPEC, 2011). Fossil fuels currently account for 87 % of primary commercial energy supply, 29 % of total energy is obtained from coal, 24 % comes from natural gas, and the biggest portion, 34 % comes from oil. Even though developed countries are restricting the use fossil fuel derivatives, predictions point to an increase of oil demand, mostly in the emerging economical potencies such as China and India, but also in the less developed countries. Overall, until 2035 there should be an increase of over 20 % [86.8 to 109.7 million barrels a day (Mb/d)] of oil demands. As a response to this growing tendency, production has been rising considerably. In 1990 about 65 million barrels of oil were produced each day, with an average sulfur content of about 1.1 %. In 2010 the world production rose to 86.4 Mb/d and predictions point to an increase up to 93.5 Mb/d in 2035 (OPEC, 2011).
Biofuels are proposed by many as the viable alternative to fossil fuels, however these do have some drawbacks: they have lower energy content per unit of volume (Achten et al., 2008), cause excessive wear of engines (Girtler et al., 2010), have bigger temporal instability (Nelson et al., 2010), their availability is limited (Weyer et al., 2010) and there is a lack of infrastructures to produce and distribute biofuels (Stephen et al., 2010). So, now and in the near future, biofuels shouldn't be able to substitute fossil fuels in the global or domestic energy profile; thus, the majority of fuels of this century should still be produced from the hydrocarbon feed stocks of fossil origin.
It is a well-known fact that fossil fuels are a non-renewable energy source, and with the increase in demand even optimistic previsions point to 84 years' worth of oil reserves. In order to expand these reserves, oil companies are forced to search for heavier and more contaminated crude oils which wouldn't be used in other circumstances. These are characterized by having higher viscosity, and greater concentrations of heavy metals, sulfur and other undesirable particles. Since the world's resources on heavy oil are more than twice those of conventional light crude oil (Javadli and Klerk, 2012), it makes them a possible midterm solution for the industry.
1.2	Sulfur
Petroleum is considerably rich in sulfur. In fact it is its third most abundant element, after carbon and hydrogen (Pokethitiyook et al., 2008). The average sulfur content varies from 0.03 to 7.89 mass % in crude oil (Soleimani et al., 2007), but depending on the sulfur content of any given crude oil supply, the sulfur concentration of the middle distillate fraction used to make diesel fuels can range widely from &amp;lt;500 to &gt; 5000 mg/L (Mohebali and Ball, 2008). Sulfur compounds can be divided in to two forms: inorganic and organic. Inorganic sulfur, such as elemental sulfur, H2S and pyrite is present in both dissolved and suspended form (Agarwal and Sharma, 2010). Organic sulfur comprised of thiols, sulfides, and thiophenic compounds represents the main source of sulfur found in crude oil. Crude oils with higher viscosities and higher densities usually contain higher amounts of more complex sulfur compounds. While aliphatic acyclic sulfides
(thioethers) and cyclic sulfides (thiolanes) are easy to remove, the sulfur contained in aromatic rings, such as thiophene and its derivatives, which can be up to 70 % of total sulfur (e.g. benzothiophene, dibenzothiophene, benzonaphthothiophene), is much more recalcitrant (Gray et al.,1995; Aminsefat et al., 2012; Javadli and Klerk, 2012).
1.3	Pollution
Since the beginning of the industrial revolution the Earth's atmosphere has been increasingly attacked by exhausts from both static and moving pollution sources that burn fossil fuels and release harmful pollutants which cause extensive changes to the natural characteristics of the air (Nuhu, 2012).
The combustion of fossil fuel generates emissions of nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, sulfur as sulfur dioxide (SO2), that is corrosive and toxic, and the fine particulate matter of metal sulfates. These emissions are responsible for damages in many different areas. Gaseous chemical compounds of sulfur constitute a major health hazard when present in the air: the large-ring thiophenes, such as dibenzothiophene, abundant in crude oil, are toxic to mammals (Murphy et al., 1992); SO2 gas at high levels can cause bronchial irritation and trigger asthma attacks in susceptible individuals and long-term exposure to combustion-related fine particulate air pollution is an important risk factor for cardio-pulmonary and lung cancer mortality (Pope et al., 2002; Mohebali et al., 2008). In addition, incomplete burning of liquid fossil fuels causes emissions of aromatic sulfur compounds to the air (Ho and Lee, 2002), and the oxidation of sulfur compounds in the atmosphere eventually leads to aerosol of sulfuric acid. This aerosol causes acid rains, which are responsible for the corrosion of many infrastructures and monuments, and even affect several living organisms including agricultural crops, thus causing direct damage to the economy (Bender and Weigel, 2011). The aerosol is also harmful to the stratospheric ozone contributing to the hole on the Earth's protective ozone layer (Denis, 2010). Lastly, sulfur compounds even prevent functioning of all major pollution control technologies such as automobile catalytic converters (Maricq etal., 2002) making it more difficult to fight against pollution.
Since gasoline, diesel and non-transportation fuels account for 75 to 80 % of the total refinery products (Babich and Moulijn, 2003), it's only natural that countries find the reductions of sulfur concentration in fuels as the most effective way to decrease the amount of SO2 emitted in to the air and limit its prejudicial effects (Mohebali and Ball, 2008).
1.4	Regulations
As a response to these problems, in recent years there has been an increasing concern regarding the sulfur levels in fossil fuel and its derivatives. Throughout the world countries have been drastically reducing the legal limits on sulfur concentration of these energy sources. This can be illustrated by limits on on-road diesel and gasoline, as shown on Figure 1 and 2 respectively.
Since 2003 and up to 2010, the USA has lowered the legal limit from 3400 to 30 ppm maximum standard for all refiners. EU member states also showed their concern and since 2005 they have required certain volumes of 10 ppm fuels in their markets, alongside 50 ppm fuels. This was further tightened in January 2009, when
the EU stipulated that all gasoline and on-road diesel should contain a maximum sulfur content of 10 ppm, with off-road diesel sulfur reaching the same level in January 2011. China's response came in December 2009 with the establishment of a nationwide gasoline sulfur limit of 150 ppm. Stricter fuel quality requirements of 50 ppm also have been imposed in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzen. China is expected to lower its nationwide limits to 50 ppm by December 2013, and possibly to a maximum 10 ppm in the 2016 time frame. India has also required 150 ppm sulfur gasoline nationwide and 50 ppm sulfur gasoline for 13 selected cities with large vehicle populations and high pollution levels since September 2010.

Figure 2 - Representation of the legal sulfur maximum concentration in gasoline by September 2011 throughout the world. Adapted from the "World oil outlook" by "Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries” (OPEC).
This tendency should continue, as OPEC predictions point to even greater increases in limitations worldwide. As Table 1 and 2 illustrate, the next decades should bring the sulfur legal limits to historic lows, as even African and Middle Eastern countries bring down their maxima.
In order to keep up with increasingly stricter regulations, the oil industry had to develop methods that would effectively remove the sulfur from the fossil fuels.

1.5	Methods for desulfurization
In the last decades several methods have been developed in order to bring the sulfur concentration of fossil fuel derivatives to the legal limit, such as desulfurization by catalytic oxidation, desulfurization by adsorption, chemical desulfurization, physical desulfurization, photochemical desulfurization and photocatalytic desulfurization. But the best known and widespread method is hydrodesulfurization (HDS).This is a catalytic process which consists on the conversion of the organic sulfur present in the fuel oil into hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S) by making it react with the oil at high pressures, between 150 and 3000 psi, and high temperatures, between 290 and 455 °C, in a fixed-bed reactor with the aid of metal catalysts such as CoMo/Al2O3 or NiMo/Al2O3 (Nikkolaj etal., 2000; Whitehurst etal., 1998; Shafi and Hutchings, 2000; Javadli and Klerk, 2012).
Even though HDS can easily remove great amounts of sulfur, it isn't enough to meet the legal demands. This is mostly because this technique isn't effective at removing complex polycyclic sulfur compounds, very abundant in these oils, such as dibenzothiophene (DBT) and its derivatives which still remain even after HDS. Molecules such as 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-2mDBT), which have alkyl groups surrounding the sulfur atom, are extremely hard to desulfurize because of low reaction rates. These recalcitrant compounds represent a significant barrier to reach very low sulfur levels in middle and heavy distillate-range fuels (Grossman et al., 2001; Javadli and Klerk, 2012; Chen et al., 2009; Monticello, 2000; Onaka et al., 2001).
sophisticated and expensive catalysts (Klein et al., 1999; Dolbear and Skov, 2000; Abotsi and Scaroni, 1989). The final desulfurization level is influenced by many factors such as the properties of the specific catalyst used (active species concentration, support properties, synthesis route), the reaction conditions (sulfiding protocol, temperature, partial pressure of hydrogen and H2S), the nature and concentration of the sulfur compounds and reactor and process design (Babich and Moulijn, 2003). Deep HDS technology, however, has several drawbacks, most of them being direct consequences of the extreme conditions applied, which limit its usefulness. Firstly they make the process of removing the organic sulfur too expensive (McFarland, 1999) and substantially increase its carbon footprint (Singh et al., 2012); they alter the final product by causing undesirable effects on fuel quality, because the higher temperatures and pressures allow the reduction of other chemical components (Folsom et al., 1999), thereby reducing the octane number of the fuel (Reichmuth et al., 2000; Javadli and Klerk, 2012; Dolbear and Skov, 2000); the catalysts’ lifespan is shortened by the poisoning effect of the generated H2S (the heavier the feedstock, the faster the catalyst deactivates) (Furimsky and Massoth, 1992; Vogelaar et al., 2003); the used catalysts form a hazardous waste and its disposal poses problems (Bhatia and Sharma, 2012); and deep HDS is affected by components in the reaction mixture such as organic hetero-compounds and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (Egorova, 2003; Folsom etal., 1999; Konishi etal., 2000; Monticello, 1996).
Although HDS processes have dominated desulfurization of petroleum in the past as the sulfur limits are decreased, there will be a need to increase the number of HDS units with large new capital investments and/or higher operating costs. This, combined with successive economic crisis, motivates the development of innovative process technologies and opens the path to explore alternative desulfurization pathways (Chandra Srivastava, 2012).
1.6	Biodesulfurization
Biotechnology is based on the use of living organisms to produce or modify products for specific applications. Nowadays it has become an important tool for the development of new approaches and solutions in many areas, such as agriculture, food, pharmaceutical or environment industries (Gavrilescu and Chisti, 2005; Singh, 2010). The biological catalysts are capable of operating in a wide range of ambient temperature and pressure and have a high selectivity, so their application results in a reduction of energy costs, lower emissions and minimal generation of undesirable by-products (Borgne and Quintero, 2003; Singh et al., 2006; Sen, 2008).
Petroleum refining is traditionally based on the use of physicochemical processes, however, because of its characteristics, the biotechnological approach has become an attractive alternative or complement in the development of new petroleum refining processes as well as in the remediation and disposal practices during the last two decades. Several microorganisms and their enzymes have already been studied on both laboratory and pilot scale to apply on several parts of the refining process, such as biodenitrogenation, biodemetallation, biodemulsification and microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR), biological control of reservoir souring and transformation of heavy crude to light crude (Singh et al., 2006; Sen 2008, Huang et al.,
2010). Although many biotransformation processes have been described, many opportunities remain to be exploited in this area (Mohebali and Ball, 2008; Singh etal., 2012).
The removal of sulfur mediated by microorganisms or biodesulfurization (BDS) is already an extensively studied approach. The first studies were reported in the 50's and 60's, but only in the last 20 years have there been successful breakthroughs (Soleimani et al., 2007; Debabov, 2010; Alves and Paixão, 2011). Through BDS it is possible to remove most of the HDS recalcitrant sulfur compounds at mild operating conditions without molecular hydrogen (Reichmuth et al., 2000), resorting to microorganisms that can remove sulfur from DBT and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Mohebali and Ball, 2008; Caro et al., 2007) using them as their sulfur source making it an easy and environmental friendly process. Furthermore studies also shown that BDS requires approximately two times less capital and 15 % less operating costs in comparison with traditional HDS (Pacheco et al., 1999; Linguist and Pacheco 1999; Kaufman et al., 1998).
1.7	Model Compounds
In biodesulfurization studies the most commonly used model compound is DBT (Bressler and Fedorak, 2001).This molecule, as stated before, is very abundant in crude oil, it is also a recalcitrant substance hard to desulfurize by HDS, and its alkyl derivatives are considered amongst the hardest to desulfurize by traditional methods (Borgne and Quintero, 2003), surviving even to deep HDS treatment (Amorelli et al., 1992). In addition, contrary to other substances, DBT is easy to manipulate since it's not mutagenic or extremely hazardous to human health (Kropp and Fedorak, 1998; Alves, 2007).
1.8	Dibenzothiophene biodesulfurization
Anaerobic biodesulfurization
In anaerobic environments, BDS follows the reductive desulfurization scheme. Through it organic sulfur is converted into hydrogen sulfide, which is then catalytically converted into elemental sulfur. This approach may be of some use at the refinery (Kaufman et al., 1998) since oxidation of hydrocarbons to undesired compounds, such as colored and gum-forming products, is residual (McFarland, 1999). However, maintaining an anaerobic process is extremely difficult and the specific activity of most of the isolated strains have been reported to be insignificant for DBTs (Armstrong et al., 1995).
Aerobic biodesulfurization
Under aerobic conditions, desulfurization occurs through oxidative pathways. These result in the production of sulfate, which is water-soluble and can be removed with the aqueous phase.
Different species may have specificity for particular sulfur compounds, and metabolic pathways are not necessarily restricted to sulfur (Kirkwood et al., 2005, 2007a, b), thus desulfurization may occur differently depending on the substances present.
This form of desulfurization, however, comes with an associated carbon cost. BDS is only viable if there is a selectivity of sulfur over carbon. If the carbon metabolism is high, it becomes important to harvest the microorganisms to recover some of the lost carbon.
There are three known pathways that attack the DBT molecule:
-	The Kodama pathway: Analogous to the naphthalene degradation pathway (Kodama et al., 1973), begins with the dihydroxylation of the peripheral aromatic ring of the DBT molecule, followed by its cleavage. This results in the accumulation of 3-hydroxy-2-formyl-benzothiophene as a water-soluble end product, with lower carbon content than DBT but with the sulfur atom intact.
-	The Van Afferden pathway: This is another ring-destructive pathway that results in the complete mineralization of DBT. Van Afferden et al. (1993) isolated Brevibacterium sp. DO, capable of using DBT for growth as the sole source of carbon, sulfur and energy. During DBT mineralization first there is an oxidation into DBT sulfone, then an aromatic dioxygenase causes the rupture of the thiophenic ring to form 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 2'-sulfinate DBT. Finally a second action of the dioxygenase opens the 2,3-dihyroxybenzene nucleus, resulting in sulfite, which is oxidized to sulfate, and benzoate which is mineralized in to CO2 and H2O.
The ring-destructive pathways may be valuable in biodegradation of DBT in the environment. However they aren't commercially useful for the petroleum industry since the destruction of the carbon skeleton of sulfur compounds by the bacteria reduces the fuel's calorific value.
-	4S pathway: This is the third and most valuable to the petroleum industry. It owes its name to the formation of four sulfur compounds during the metabolism of DBT. First, a DBT monooxygenase (DszC) catalyzes two oxidation steps and converts DBT into Dibenzothiophenesulfone (DBTS). Then a second monooxigenase, DBT sulfonemonooxigenase (DszA), turns DBTS into 2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl), and finally a liase, 2'-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinate desulfinase (DszB), promotes the removal of the sulfur resulting in the formation of 2-hydroxybiphenyl and sulfite. There is a fourth enzyme, FMN-reductase (DszD) with an indirect yet important role, since it regulates the activity of the monooxygenases by regulating the levels of reduced flavin (Nomura et al., 2005).
This pathway is especially important, because with it the microorganisms are able to remove sulfur from DBT and use it as a sulfur source, but they are incapable of destroying the carbon skeleton, maintaining most of the calorific value of the fossil fuel (Wang and Krawiec, 1996).
Several studies have been conducted using bacterial genera capable of using 4S pathway for BDS, which include Arthrobacter, Agrobacterium, Brevibacterium, Klebsiella, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Paenibacillus, Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas and the two most important as of now: Gordonia and Rhodococcus (Clark and Kirk, 1994; Tanaka etal., 2002; Alves etal., 2007; Alves and Paixão, 2011).
1.9	Limitations of BDS process
There are a few limitations to this alternative process, which have delayed its commercial use. Most of the studies presented tend to focus on model compounds (Grossman et al., 2001; Alves, 2007), so results may not translate in the same way when using actual oils. These are much more complex substrates so it is necessary to take into account the problems such as toxicity of compounds present in the oil, as well as the existence of steric hindrance associated with the structure of these compounds that hinder the activity of microbial enzymatic systems (Alves, 2007).
In fact, results with actual fossil fuel derivatives are somewhat lower than desired. Studies with petroleum show results of total sulfur removals between 30 and 70 % for mid-distillates (Grossman et al., 1999), 24 to 78 % for hydro-treated diesel (Rhee et al., 1998; Maghsoudi et al., 2001; Ma et al., 2006), 20 to 60 % for light gas oils (Chang etal., 2000; Ishii etal., 2005) and 25 to 60 % for crude oils (McFarland, 1999).
Moreover, BDS shows a low conversion rate which may be caused by feedback inhibition of the enzyme activities, or even the accumulation of 2-HBP, the product of the 4S pathway, which is extremely toxic to most microorganisms affecting their viability (Alves and Paixão, 2011).
There are other problems closely related to the large scale operation, such as the difficulty in controlling the various parameters that regulate biocatalyst activity and stability, the oil/water volume ratio, the logistics of sanitary handling, shipment, storage and use of microorganisms within the production field or refinery environment (Javadli And Klerk, 2012). There are also problems associated with the tri-phasic system, one of the most used in BDS (Kaufman et al., 1997; Setti et al., 1997; McFarland et al., 1998). The cells, mixed with water and oil, produce a sort of surfactant, which emulsifies the oil and makes the separation from water very difficult (Naito et al., 2001).This system also makes cell recovery very difficult (Alves, 2007).
Another big setback lies in the fact that BDS of DBT is inhibited in the presence of other sulfur compounds in the culture medium. In fact, even small concentrations of sulfate or other easy access sulfur sources produce an inhibitory effect on BDS (Kim et al., 2004; Mohebali et al., 2008). To add up, the bacteria have very low sulfur requirements. In Rhodococcus sp., the cells were found to require 0.1 mM of sulfur for normal growth (Reichmuth et al., 2000). Only 1 % of bacterial dry weight is sulfur (Stoner et al., 1990), which implies a very low need in relation to this element. Therefore, it is important to use feedstocks containing low residual concentration or even a null content of sulfur.
Finally, there is also a limitation shared with many other biotechnological processes, which is the costs of the culture medium, representing 30 to 40 % of the total, namely the carbon source, which makes the process more expensive. At present, there is no economically suitable method for large-scale preparation of biocatalysts (Ma et al., 2006). Thus, in order to reduce costs, it is important to search for cheap and widely available raw materials. The utilization of alternative carbon sources derived from agro-industrial by-products, wastes or plants that can be grown on marginal land may thereby represent a sustainable strategy to use when searching for carbon sources for biotechnological processes (Alves et al., 2008). Alternative substrates
have widely been used as feedstock for several fermentation processes such as for the production of lactic acid (Bustos et al., 2005), polyhydroxybutyrate (Hu et al., 1999), ethanol (Karimi et al., 2006), pullulan (Israilides et al., 1998), xanthan gum (Yoo and Harcum, 1999), bacterial cellulose (Bae and Shoda, 2005), xylanase (Nascimento et al., 2003; Alves et al., 2008) and biocontrol agents (Abadias et al., 2003; Costa et al., 2001; Peighami-Ashnaei etal., 2009; Verma etal., 2007 Manso etal., 2010)
There are many examples, where residues were successfully used in order to lower the production costs, such as malt extract, dry beer extract, soy powder, fruit syrups and molasses. However, many more are yet to be explored.
1.10	Alternative Carbon sources
1.10.1	Carob pulp
The carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua L.) is a leguminous tree that is native to Mediterranean countries. It is very abundant in Portugal, mostly in the southern area, in Algarve. This tree grows in soft and dry places, preferring poor and calcareous soils (Batlle et al., 1997). It's also drought-resistant and requires little care being regarded as a possible crop for dry land areas for diversification and revitalization of coastal agriculture in its native countries (Tous, 1996).
Recent data indicates that carob pod production worldwide amounts to nearly 400,000 tons/year, of which 50,000 tons are produced each year in the Algarve, and its interest lies mostly on the seeds. The seed's endosperm is a molecule composed of mannose and galactose sugar units (ratio 4:1). This polysaccharide, LBG or locust bean gum, presents high viscosity in water, over a wide range of temperatures and pH. It can be used as a thickener, stabilizer, binder and gelling agent in the food industry and in several technical applications (Manso et al., 2010), including the manufacture of chemicals, paper and cosmetics as well as in the pharmaceutical industry (Avallone etal., 1997; Makris and Kefalas, 2004; Santos etal., 2005).
World demand for LBG equates to about 30,000 tons of carob seed. The seed is processed in Portugal and the products obtained are exported to Japan, Holland, Denmark and USA (Correia and Martins-Lougao, 2005).
Since carob seeds represent only 10 % of the weight of the fruit, there is a large amount of waste material in the remaining 90 % of carob pulp. These carob industrial wastes are small carob kibbles with a high content of sugars, around 50 %, mainly sucrose (more than 30 %), fructose and glucose with values of 20 to 50 % (Petit and Pinilla, 1995), 45 % (Avallone et al., 1997), 48 to 56 % (Yousif and Alghzawi, 2000), and 28 to 82 % (Biner et al., 2007). These are easily extractable by water, producing sugar-rich syrups (Manso et al., 2010) which give economical relevance to the carob pulp as an inexpensive and available feedstock for various biological products. Carob pulp is already used as a cocoa substitute in the food industry, or even directly in the diet of farm animals (Lima-Costa etal., 2012).
Even though carob pods have these applications, at the present most are discarded and not effectively used. For that reason the by-product of this industry represents a cheap and available raw material to produce a value-added product, being among the industrial residues most used as new carbon sources for several bioprocesses (Carvalheiro etal., 2011; Mendes etal., 2007; Sanchez-Segado etal., 2012).
1.10.2	Strawberry tree fruit
The strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) is native to the Mediterranean region, Western Europe, northern to western France and Ireland. It is very common in Portugal, and its fruit is mainly used as food and as raw material to make a strong alcoholic drink, “aguardente de medronho”, as well as jams. It is very im portant in terms of environmental aspects due to its tolerance to dryness and its ability to regenerate and recolonize after forest fires.
The fruits are very rich in vitamins, organic acids, phenolic compounds, and their sugar concentration ranges from 42 % to 52 % (Ayaz et al., 2000; Alarcao-E-Silva et al., 2001) of which 60 % is fructose and 40 % is Glucose. There are some studies which report the successful use this fruit as a carbon source (Santo et al., 2012). However, this is mostly an unexplored resource that grows naturally and in large quantities throughout the country.
1.10.3	Jerusalem artichoke
Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) also known as sun root or topinambour, is a species of sunflower. Although native to North America, this species has long since been cultivated throughout the world. It is traditionally grown for animal consumption or sugar production for food, electronics and pharmaceutical applications. (Baldini et al., 2004; Bosticco et al., 1989; Meijer and Mathijssen, 1991; Marchetti, 1993).
Although its yield is lower than other sugar producing plants such as corn or sugar beet it has other advantages. Jerusalem artichoke has high fertility and demands low amounts of fertilizers. It can grow on poor land; it's resistant to pests, diseases and saline soils (Zhao, 2011). Furthermore, it can resist desert conditions and frost better than other cultures. And since it is drought-resistant, it can be used to improve soil and water conservation in desertfied areas (Cheng, 2009).
Instead of accumulating starch, Jerusalem artichoke tubers accumulate inulin. Inulin is a linear fructan in which a variable number of fructose units are linked by p (2 ^1) bonds, and glucose typically ends the inulin chain through an a (1	2) bond. Inulin is soluble in water and after hydrolytic breakdown the reducing sugars
fructose and glucose are released.
These characteristics make this plant a natural source of fructose for the industry and an attractive alternative carbon source for microbial growth. Several studies have already been conducted not only with inulinaseproducing yeasts for the production of ethanol (Gencheva et al., 2012), but also with microorganisms using the acid-hydrolyzed extracts as carbon source. Jerusalem artichoke has also been used as carbon source for
the production of other compounds such as biodiesel (Cheng et al., 2009) and propionic acid (Liang et al., 2012).
1.11	Sulfur content of the alternative carbon sources
The use of alternative carbon sources by desulfurizing bacteria might raise a problem associated to the presence of readily bioavailable sulfur compounds. As it is well known, plant material and agro-residues usually carry considerable amounts of sulfate (Frazer, 1935; Werther et al., 2000), which hinder their use in BDS processes. Thus, in order to use these carbon sources for BDS studies it is first necessary to reduce sulfate concentration to minimum levels and for this, there are several methods. One of the most common is the use of barium, namely in the form of barium chloride (BaCl2), to precipitate the sulfate (Jegadeesan et al., 2005). When mixed in solution, BaCl2 dissociates, allowing the barium atoms to bond with the sulfate groups forming barium sulfate (BaSO4). In this form it has a very low solubility (0.00285 g/L at 30 °C) and thus immediately precipitates, being easily removed (Guo et al., 2009). Although barium can be hazardous to human health, it becomes less toxic when bound to sulfate allowing an easier manipulation, essential for large scale work. This process is abundantly used in some industries such as bleach factories as a method to remove excess sulfate (Rudie and Hart, 2006) that is relatively easy and cheap to use.
1.12	The genus Gordonia
The genus Gordonia was established in 1997, after a first failed attempt in 1971, when Tsukamura proposed the creation of the genus Gordona, whose individuals were subsequently reclassified in the genus Rhodococcus (Goodfellow and Alderson, 1977).
Phylogenetically, the genus Gordonia belongs to the order Actinomycetales, suborder Corynebacterineae, which makes them a close relative of the genera Rhodococcus, Mycobacterium and Nocardia. According to the NCBI website, as of August of 2012 the genus Gordonia comprised 32 validly published species (NCBI, 2012).
The members of this genus are very diverse (Takeuchi and Hatano, 1988) and they are characterized as aerobic, catalase positive, gram-positive to gram-variable bacteria that do not form spores. Gordonia species have been isolated from very different native biotopes such as soil or mangrove rhizosphere, from extensively industrially influenced habitats such as oil-producing wells or hydrocarbon-contaminated soil, from artificial sources such as wastewater treatment bioreactors or biofilters, and from diseased humans. Other Gordonia species have also been isolated from activated sludges in aeration tanks of biological sewage-treatment plants (Lemmer and Kroppenstedt, 1984) and from the packing material of a biofilter used for biological odor abatement (Bendinger et al., 1995; Klatte et al., 1996).
Some Gordonia species, like G. bronchialis (Sng et al., 2004) or G. araii (Jannat-Khah et al., 2008) are opportunistic pathogens, causing grave diseases in immunosuppressed individuals. However, the genus Gordonia is mostly recognized for other characteristics such as its bioremediation and biodegradation capacities, since these microorganisms are able to degrade xenobiotics, substituted and non-substituted
hydrocarbons, environmental pollutants and natural compounds that are not readily biodegradable (Arenskotter etal., 2004). Therefore, individuals of this genus are able to act on contaminated soils and water, helping in the recovery of these environments (Luo et al., 2007; Bendinger et al., 1993). Some species such as Gordonia cholesterolivorans can even degrade steroid compounds as cholesterol, cholesterone, ergosterol and stigmasterol (Drzyzga et al., 2011). Others like Gordonia polyisoprenivorans are able to degrade both natural and synthetic rubber (Linos et al., 1999).
The individuals of the genus Gordonia also have a great biotechnological potential, since through their anabolic pathways they produce several compounds with many applications. Some species can produce biosurfactants (De los Reyes et al., 1998a, 1998b), carotenoids (De Miguel et al., 2001) and “Gordonan” (Kondo et al., 2000), which is a cell aggregation-inducing polysaccharide.
One of the most important characteristic of this genus is its ability to perform BDS through the 4S pathway (Kim et al., 1999, 2000; Mohebali et al., 2007a). The first representative of the genus Gordonia described as being capable of DBT desulfurization was Gordonia sp. strain CYKS1 (Rhee et al., 1998). Since then many others have been described within the genus, such as Gordonia desulfuricans, Gordonia nitida and Gordonia alkanivorans. The latter is probably the most studied and the one with greater number of strains important to BDS. In recent years 2 strains have been especially studied: RIPI90A (Shavandi et al., 2009, 2010; Mohebali et al., 2007a, 2007b, 2008) and strain 1B.
1.13	Gordonia alkanivorans strain 1B
This work is centered on Gordonia alkanivorans Strain 1B, which was isolated from soil samples harvested from hydrocarbon-contaminated grounds at the EXPO-98 area (Lisbon, Portugal).
Much is already known about this strain, since its isolation it has been the center of many studies. In 2004 Alves et al. showed, among other things, that this strain had great desulfurization capabilities. When grown with a minimum medium and with glucose as single carbon source, it reduced DBT concentration from 478 to 168 pM after 120 h of culture, corresponding to a specific desulfurization rate of 1.03 pmol of DBT/(g of dry cell/h). This rate is similar to that obtained with another Gordonia sp. strain, CYKS1 (0.917 pmol of DBT/[g of dry cell/h]), which reduced the concentration of DBT from 320 to 50 pM after 120 h of bacterial cultivation (Rhee et al., 1998). The maximum extracellular concentration of 2-HBP, however, was somewhat lower, about 120 pM, which is only 27 % of the consumed DBT (450 pM). This non-stoichiometric accumulation of 2-HBP had also been observed in Bacillus subtilis strain WU-S2B (Kirimura et al., 2001) and in Nocardia sp. strain CYKS2 (Chang et al.,1998; Alves et al., 2004).
Later in 2007, another work by the same team studied the strains desulfurization operon (dsz). In their research they identified its genes and compared them with previously described bacterial genes from Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS8. Three open reading frames were identified: dszA, dszB and dszC, which showed high similarity to those of IGTS8 (88 % for dszA, 88 % for dszB and 90 % for dszC). In the same work Alves et al., proceeded to clone and express G. alkanivorans dszAB genes in Escherichia coli. The resulting
recombinant strain was able to grow in a culture medium containing dibenzothiophene sulfone (DBTS) as the only sulfur source, desulfurizing the same amount of DBTS (0.2 mM) to 2-HBP, but 4.5-fold faster than strain 1B (Alves et al., 2007).
More recently Alves and Paixão studied the effect of 2-hydroxybiphenyl in cells of both Gordonia alkanivorans 1B and Rhodococcus erythropolis D1 grown in glucose. The IC50 values obtained showed especially the high acute toxicity of 2-HBP with low IC50 values, 0.52 mM for strain D1 and 0.62 mM for strain 1B. These results were also confirmed by the chronic toxicity data which resulted in IC50 of 0.21 to 0.27 mM for strain 1B and IC50 of 0.38 to 0.47 mM for strain D1. They observed that these results were similar to those obtained by Chen et al. (2008), using Microbacterium sp. (41 % of growth inhibition with 0.2 mM 2-HBP) and those obtained by Rhee et al. (1998) with a Gordonia strain (with increase of generation time by about 50 % with 0.2 mM 2-HBP). By analyzing these results they stated that, since 1B's growth rate is slower than that of D1, microorganisms exhibiting faster generation times could be more resistant to 2-HBP accumulation during a BDS process, thus explaining the differences in toxicity (Alves and Paixão, 2011).
Some studies were also conducted to evaluate the performance of the hydrolyzates of recycled paper sludge as alternative low-cost feedstock for biological desulfurization. They showed that this glucose rich hydrolyzate, obtained after enzymatic mixture dialysis (dialyzed hydrolyzate), successfully allowed DBT desulfurization. 250 pM DBT was consumed after 96 h, displaying a maximum specific productivity of 2-hydroxybiphenyl of
1.1	pmol/g(dry cell weight)/h. Moreover maximum specific growth rates showed that 1B grows better using hydrolyzates in comparison with the corresponding culture medium containing commercial grade glucose as the only carbon source (pmax for dialyzed hydrolyzate recycled paper sludge was 0.035 h- while pmax for glucose was 0.019 h-1) (Alves et al., 2008).
Recently, this strain has been described as being fructophilic (Alves and Paixão, 2011). This means it prefers fructose to glucose as a carbon source to grow, growing faster and thus desulfurizing at faster rates in the presence of fructose. Fructophilic pathways were usually associated with yeasts; in fact, until the discovery of this characteristic, lactic bacteria were the only exception (Endo, 2012; Sutterlin, 2010). Since the utilization of microorganisms in industry requires cheap carbon sources to be productive, the fact that this strain is fructophilic opens new possibilities in terms of available carbon sources, allowing the exploration of some fructose rich residues and plants that might both make the process cheaper and more efficient.
1.14	Scope of the thesis
This study tries to take advantage of the recently discovered fructophilic behavior of Gordonia alkanivorans strain 1B, to explore new fructose rich alternative carbon sources for the biodesulfurization process. With this in mind three sources were selected for testing, carob pulp, strawberry tree fruit, and Jerusalem artichoke tubers. These were chosen based on their availability, natural characteristics, and high fructose content.
The main goals were:
&gt; To produce liquors and juices with high concentrations of sugar and high percentages of fructose;
&gt;	To optimize them for growth and biodesulfurization with G. alkanivorans strain 1B;
&gt;	To compare the results obtained and select the best alternative carbon source for BDS.
2.	MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1	Chemicals and reagents
DBT (99 %) was obtained from Acros Organics, 2-hydroxybiphenyl (2-HBP) was from Sigma, dimethylformamide (DMF) and Na2CO3 (&gt;99 %) were from Riedelde Haen 4-mDBT (96 %) was from Aldrich Chem. Co. BaCl2.2H2O (&gt;99 %) and Sodium sulfate anhydrous (&gt;99 %) were obtained from Merck. CFDA and PI were acquired from Invitrogen. Inulin (90-95 %), from chicory roots, was purchased from Fagron. Jerusalem artichoke tubers were cultivated in our laboratory campus (LNEG, Portugal). Strawberry tree fruits were collected in Castelo Branco, Portugal. Carob pods were obtained from Agrupa, Faro, Portugal. All other reagents were of the highest grade commercially available.
2.2	Microorganism and culture media
The microorganism used in this study was the bacterium Gordonia alkanivorans strain 1B, isolated in our laboratory (Alves et al., 2005). The basal salts medium used for the cultivation/maintenance of this microorganism and further on for the desulfurization and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) tests, was a sulfur-free mineral culture medium (SFM) containing 1.22 g/l NH4Cl, 2.5 g/l KH2PO4, 2.5 g/l Na2HPO4.2H2O, 0.17 g/l MgCl2.6H2O. This medium was supplemented with 0.5 ml/l of Vishniac solution (Vishniac and Santer, 1957), a trace elements solution without sulfur, and its final pH was adjusted to 7.5. In the assays aiming to evaluate the effect of different sulfate concentrations in the ability of G. alkanivorans to desulfurize DBT, the SFM medium was further supplemented with increasing concentrations of a sterile solution of Na2SO4 sterile solution.
Bacterial cultures were performed in shake-flasks incubated at 30 °C and 150 rpm of agitation in a horizontal incubator (unitron CH-4103, Infors AG, Bottingen, Switzerland). For most of the assays the inoculum was 2 % (v/v), of a culture grown with fructose (5 g/l) as single carbon source and 200 pM DBT as single sulfur source for 72 hours. When using glucose as single carbon source the inoculum was 2 % (v/v) from a culture grown with glucose (5 g/l) and 200 pM DBT for 7 days.
2.3	Biodesulfurization assays
Biodesulfurization (BDS) tests were mostly performed in 500 ml shaken-flasks with 100 ml of total volume. 400 pM of DBT, dissolved in DMF, were added to the sterilized medium to be used as sulfur source.
These assays were carried out with a concentration of approximately 25 g/l of reducing sugars, unless otherwise stated. Pure carbon sources such as glucose, sucrose and fructose were dissolved in millipore water in 50 % (w/v) concentrated solutions, which were filter sterilized with a 0.22 pm pore sterile filter before being added to the medium in aseptic conditions.
2.4	Carob pulp liquors
Carob pulp was mixed with deionized water in a 1:1 ratio and left shaking overnight at room temperature. The resulting mixture was taken to a press in order to extract the liquor which was then subjected to an acidic hydrolysis by lowering the liquor's pH to 2 with hydrochloric acid and leaving it at 55 °C for 48 hours. Afterwards the pH was raised to 7.5 using NaOH and the liquor was filter sterilized.
Different concentrations of sterile BaCl2 were added to the carob pulp liquor in aseptic conditions, shaken vigorously and incubated at 30 °C for different periods of time. To stop the reaction the liquor was centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 15 minutes (Biofuge 15, Heraeus Sepatech, Germany) (Silva et al., in press) and the pellet discarded. The effects of BaCl2 concentration and time of treatment on sulfate removal from carob pulp liquor were studied according to the statistical design.
Tests were later conducted to evaluate the desulfurization ability of G. alkanivorans using the carob pulp liquors treated with different concentrations of BaCl2. The liquors were diluted in sulfur-free medium in a ratio of 1:6 and used as the single carbon source and 400 pM of DBT were added as a model fuel for BDS.
G. alkanivorans was then grown with three different carob pulp liquors: untreated, hydrolyzed and treated under optimal conditions, all with 25 g/l of reducing sugars to assess their quality as carbon sources for BDS.
2.5	Jerusalem artichoke juice
The Jerusalem artichoke tubers were washed and dried to remove dirt and other particles before taking them to a juicer. The resulting liquid was centrifuged for 20 minutes at 10000 rpm and 4 °C. At this point, part of the liquid was stored for later usage, while the rest was submitted to an acidic hydrolysis to convert the inulin into fructose and glucose. As with the carob liquor, the juice's pH was lowered to 2 using HCl, and it was left for 48 hours at 55 °C. Afterwards the pH was adjusted to different values using NaOH tablets, and the juices were filter sterilized. Different concentrations of sterile BaCl2 were then added to the Jerusalem artichoke juices in aseptic conditions, shaken vigorously and incubated at 30 °C for 36 hours. The juice was centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 15 minutes and the pellet discarded. The effects of BaCl2 concentration and pH on sulfate removal from Jerusalem artichoke juice were studied according to the statistical design.
The resulting juices were then used as carbon sources with approximately 25 g/l of reducing sugars to determine the treatments effect on both microbial growth and desulfurization.
The optimal conditions which resulted from the study of these assays were then applied to both the hydrolyzed and non-hydrolyzed juice for the desulfurization assays. G.alkanivorans was submitted to four different assays using hydrolyzed, treated and untreated juice and non-hydrolyzed treated and untreated juice as the single carbon source for BDS.
2.6	Experimental design
Experimental distribution for two factors, according to the Doehlert uniform shell design (Doehlert, 1970) was used to produce response surfaces. Fourteen experiments (including replicates) were carried out within an experimental domain, which differed for the carob pulp liquors and the Jerusalem artichoke juices.
When applied to the liquors, BaCl2 (X1) varied between 0 % (w/v) and 0.5 % (w/v) and time (X2) between 6 and 36 hours. When applied to Jerusalem artichoke juice, BaCl2 (X1) concentration varied between 0.125 % (w/v) and 0.625 % (w/v) and pH (X2) between 5 and 9 hours. These interval values were selected after preliminary assays. Coded representation of the factors was used for calculation purposes. The response under study was the sulfate concentration. The model used to express the responses was a second order
22
polynomial model: y/=p0+p1X1+p2X2+p12X12+p11X1 +p22X2 where, Yi is the response from experiment i; p are the parameters of the polynomial model; X is the experimental factor level (coded units).
2.7	Strawberry tree fruit juice
Strawberry tree fruits were mashed into a pulp which was centrifuged for 20 min at 10000 rpm at 4°C (Sigma, 2-16K, Sartorius, Gottingen, Germany). The liquid layer was removed and treated using UV to prevent some contaminants. The juice was then used in BDS assays as the single carbon source with concentration of 10 and 25g/l of reducible sugars.
2.8	Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation tests
2.8.1	Enzymatic extract
Talf1 enzymatic extract was produced in our laboratory by the yeast strain Talf1 isolate (Paixão et al., 2012). It was cultivated in yeast-malt extract broth medium supplemented with 25 % (v/v) Jerusalem artichoke juice. At the end of the growth assay, after 8 days, the culture was centrifuged and the extract was filter sterilized.
2.8.2	Assays with inulin and Jerusalem artichoke
The assays using inulin were performed with 200 pM DBT with and without the addition of 3 % (v/v) of Talf1 enzymatic extract.10 g/l of inulin from a concentrated solution 20 % (w/v) were also added as the sole carbon source.
The assays using Jerusalem artichoke juice were performed with 400 pM DBT with and without the addition of 5 % (v/v) of the same enzymatic extract. Non-hydrolyzed Jerusalem artichoke juice both treated and untreated with BaCl2 was added as single carbon source to obtain approximately 10 g/l of reducing sugars.
2.9	Analytical methods
The development of the culture was monitored both by analysis of the absorbance at 600 nm (Thermo Electron Corporation Spectrophotometer, model Genesys 6, Madison, USA) and dry cell weight (DCW) values, by centrifuging the samples 15 minutes at 13000 rpm at room temperature and drying them overnight at 100 °C.
Sulfate concentration was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography using a Dionex chromatograph ICS-1000 (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA), equipped with an ASRS - Ultra II suppressor, an AG14A (4 x 50 mm) pre-column and an IONPAC AS14A (4 x 250 mm) column. Sodium carbonate 8 mM was used as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
The DBT desulfurization was mostly evaluated by measuring 2-HBP production (the final product of DBT desulfurization). The culture broth was previously acidified with HCl and then the 2-HBP and DBT were extracted from with ethyl acetate during a 5 min vortex. After the phase separation occurred, the organic phase was analyzed by gas-chromatography (GC) in a gas-chromatograph (Model CP9001, Chrompack, Middelburg, The Netherlands) equipped with a flame ionization detector. An Alltech 10 % SE-30 on 80/100 Chromosorb W-HP column was used with nitrogen as the carrier gas. The chromatograph oven start temperature was 190 °C for 2 minutes and the end temperature 225 °C maintained, for 2 minutes (heating rate of 6 °C/min). The injector and detector temperatures were set for 250 and 290 °C, respectively. In all GC measurements 4-mDBT was used as internal standard to minimize variations.
Glucose, sucrose and fructose concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography instrumentation (Waters LC1 Module 1 plus, Millford, LA) equipped with a differential refractive index detector. A Waters SugarPak 1 column (6.5 x 300 mm, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) was used operating at 75 °C with Ca-EDTA at 50 g/L as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The samples were prepared by centrifuging 15 minutes at 13000 rpm at room temperature. SSF assay samples were left 10 minutes in boiling water, immediately after being collected, in order to inactivate the enzyme activity and prevent further degradation of the inulin molecules.
Flow cytometric analysis was performed in a FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with an argon laser emitting at 488 nm and data were analyzed using WinMDI 2.9 software (1993-2000, Joseph Trotter). G. alkanivorans cells were stained with both carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) (green fluorescence, FL1) and Propidium iodide (PI) (red fluorescence, FL3). CFDA is a non-fluorescent permeant substrate that is taken up by the cells and converted inside the cell to a fluorescent substance by esterases, and PI binds to DNA but cannot cross an intact cytoplasmic membrane. Stock solutions of 10 mM CFDA in acetone and 1.5 mM PI in distilled water were prepared and stored at -20 °C and 4 °C, respectively. Cells were centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 10 minutes (Microfuge 18 Centrifuge, Beckman Coulter inc., Palo Alto, Germany), resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) and sonicated for 10 seconds. Concentration of the cell suspension was adjusted to approximately 3000 events per second by flow cytometric analysis and the sample total volume set to 1 ml. The cells were then incubated with 5 pl of CFDA for 30 minutes at 37°C in the dark. After incubation, cells were washed and resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer. To complete the double-staining, 1 pl of PI was added and the flow cytometric analysis performed immediately. Instrument settings were selected for the forward and side scatter signals in order to discriminate the cells from background noise and debris. Samples containing Tris-HCl buffer without cells were analyzed to confirm the presence of a constant background noise and confirm that this was not due to unstained cells. For the control assays, healthy (metabolic active) cells were harvested during the exponential phase using fructose as
the single carbon source (5 g/l) and 200 ^M of DBT, and after several days of nutrients starvation (stressed cells). Dead cells were obtained by incubating healthy cells) in ethanol at 70% (v/v) for 1 min.
3.	RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1	Fructophilic behavior of Gordonia alkanivorans strain 1B
There is little work published about the fructophilic behavior of Gordonia alkanivorans strain 1B (Alves &amp;amp; Paixao 2011), so it became fundamental to show how this strain reacts with pure carbon sources before moving on to the alternative, more complex ones. In this context, desulfurization assays with strain 1B were carried out to demonstrate and compare its ability to grow and desulfurize using DBT (400pM) as single sulfur source and glucose (25 g/l) or fructose (25 g/l) as sole carbon source in batch cultures.
Figure 3- Time-course profile of the desulfurization of 400 pM DBT by G. alkanivorans strain 1B with 25 g/l of glucose (a) and fructose (b) as the single carbon source. All results were obtained in triplicate. Standard deviation is indicated by the error bars.
Figure 3 shows the time course of strain 1B cultivation using glucose (Fig. 3a) and fructose (Fig. 3b). When glucose was used as the single carbon source, the maximum cellular growth was obtained after 287 hours, with approximately 11 absorbance units at 600 nm, the complete consumption of the carbon source and a specific maximum growth rate (pmax) of 0.030 h- . When fructose was used, the growth results showed an increase. Maximum cellular growth was obtained after only 117 to 161 hours, reaching more than 12
-1
absorbance units, with about 2 g/l of fructose left, and with a pmax of 0.070 h- . These results clearly show that
The desulfurization ability was evaluated in terms of 2-HBP production, the end product of the 4S pathway. As shown in Fig. 3a, when strain 1B was grown on glucose, 2-HBP was already detectable at 23 hours, achieving a maximum value of 306 pM by the end of the growth (312 h). In spite of 400 pM DBT having been consumed, ~25 % of 2-HBP produced was not accounted by GC (similar results have been described before) (Alves et al., 2005). On average 12 pmol of 2-HBP were produced for each gram of consumed sugar. The maximum production rate was 3.2 pM/h and the maximum specific production rate (q2-HBP) was 1.19 pmol g-(DCW) h- . When strain 1B was grown in fructose, 2-HBP was first detected at 24 hours, achieving a maximum value of 393 pM in only 89 h, which translates in a maximum production rate of 31 pM/h and a q2-
-1 -1
HBP of 6.565 pmol g- (DCW) h- with approximately 17 pmol of 2-HBP produced for each gram of consumed sugar. Comparing the results observed with both carbon sources tested, it becomes clear that fructose is not only responsible for faster cellular growth rates, but also for faster desulfurization. With this carbon source the 2-HBP final concentration reaches values very close to stoichiometry, and the maximum specific desulfurization rate is 5.5-fold higher than with glucose. These results highlight the fructophilic behavior of G. alkanivorans strain 1B.
3.2	Alternative carbon sources
3.2.1	Sugar concentration
In order to lower the costs associated with the BDS process it becomes important to use alternative and cheap carbon sources with a low sulfur concentration. Knowing that this bacterium is fructophilic it's also fundamental to obtain liquors and juices rich in fructose. In this context, several liquors and juices were prepared from carob pulp kibbles, strawberry tree fruits and Jerusalem artichoke tubers, Table 3 shows their sugar and sulfate concentration.
All of them revealed great sugar concentrations, with high percentages of fructose. Comparing the untreated liquors or juices, carob pulp liquor (CPL) was the one that presented the highest sugar concentration (339 g/l), but also the lowest percentage of fructose (19 %). Strawberry tree fruit juice (STFJ) had 173 g/l sugars, of which 67 % was fructose, and Jerusalem artichoke juice (JAJ) was the one with the lowest total sugar content (~22 g/l) where ~52 % was fructose.
3.2.2	Sulfate
Relatively to the sulfate content, the alternative carbon source with the highest sulfate concentration was JAJ (~451 mg/l), while the other two presented considerably lower values, ~49 mg/l for CPL and ~41 mg/l for STFJ.
1- This represents the average value of 2-HBP production per hour, without taking into account the dry cell weight. It is useful when comparing production rates for assays in which no dry weight values were calculated.

3.3	Desulfurization inhibition by sulfates
Many studies have demonstrated that the presence of readily available sources of sulfur leads to an inhibition of the BDS process (Setti et al., 1999, Bahtia and Sharma, 2010). To evaluate the inhibitory effect of sulfate on the ability of G. alkanivorans strain 1B to desulfurize DBT, growth assays were performed in sulfur-free medium which was supplemented with increasing concentrations of sulfate, from 6 to 60 mg/l. Pure fructose (10 g/l) was used in the assays as the carbon source to guarantee that there was no addition of sulfate that may affect the results. Figure 4 shows the effect of different concentrations of sulfate on the time course profiles of G. alkanivorans cell growth (Fig. 4a) and 2-HBP production (Fig. 4b). These results were compared with a control assay in the same conditions where no sulfate was added in order to determine the percentage of desulfurization inhibition (Fig. 4a).
Fig. 4b demonstrates that the increase of sulfate concentration resulted in a decrease of 2-HBP production as well as in a delay in the beginning of the DBT desulfurization. When no sulfate was added (0 mg/l), DBT desulfurization began in the first hours. For a concentration of 6 mg/l of sulfate there was still no 2-HBP production after the first 24 h and the final quantity attained was smaller, presenting already a desulfurization inhibition of 22.4 %. As the concentration of sulfate increased, 2-HBP appeared progressively later and in smaller quantities. With 34 mg/l of sulfate, the production of 2-HBP only began after more than 48 h and in very low concentrations and for 60 mg/l full inhibition occurred since GC analysis did not detect any 2-HBP. This desulfurization inhibition by sulfate has been observed in works studying desulfurization via the 4S metabolic pathway (Ohshiro et al., 1996), the pathway that G. alkanivorans uses for the degradation of DBT. From the desulfurization inhibition results for 72 h, ranging from 22.4 % to 100 % inhibition for the tested
sulfate concentrations (6 to 60 mg/l), the median inhibitory concentration value (IC50) was interpolated from the curve of the % inhibition against concentration by linear regression. The IC50-72h value estimated for sulfate was 13.6 ± 0.6 mg/l. Mohebali and coworkers in 2008, also studied the effect of sulfate on the DBT desulfurization but with a different Gordonia strain and using a resting cell system reporting that sulfate with concentrations of 14.4 mg/l or higher repressed the desulfurization.
Observing the time course profile of cell growth, two different growth patterns can be detected (Fig. 4a). When sulfate concentration was residual (6 mg/l of sulfate) there was a longer lag phase and a slower growth rate, similar to the growth assay where DBT was the only sulfur source available. On the other hand, for higher concentrations of sulfate, the growth patterns presented a reduced lag phase and faster growth. The slower growth pattern can be related to the low solubility of DBT in aqueous solution, approximately 0.0061 mM (Seymour et al., 1997), and the need to metabolize it to release the sulfur. As the desulfurization inhibition became higher (for 11 mg/l of sulfate the inhibition was already around 40%) the sulfur source used for cell growth was preferentially the sulfate available in the culture medium, instead of DBT, resulting in a faster growth profile.
The overall results showed that even a small concentration of sulfate can translate into a great loss of the desulfurization yield so, the optimization of sulfate removing methods becomes of great importance when
using alternative carbon sources.

3.4	Removal of sulfate
In order to remove the sulfate present in the liquors and juices, it was necessary to optimize the BaCl2 precipitation method. In this context, after determining the initial sulfate concentrations in the carbon sources (Table 3), some wide range preliminary tests were performed using CPL to determine the basic conditions for sulfate removal using BaCl2.
Table 4 presents the results from these preliminary assays. The analysis of these results shows that low temperatures drastically reduce sulfate precipitation, even after extended periods of time. The removal of sulfate was similar either at 30°C or at 50 °C, and even with or without agitation. Thus, further precipitation assays were held at 30°C with no agitation.
Table 4- Preliminary results of different conditions for sulfate removal using BaCl2 on carob pulp liquor.

Other exploratory studies were also developed with the other carbon sources. In the case of the strawberry tree fruit juice, it reacted to even low concentrations of BaCl2 and almost immediately solidified turning into a sort of jelly, which made impossible to use it for further growth assays. So, the methods of BaCl2 sulfate removal were useless for this carbon source.
In order to optimize the conditions for sulfate removal by BaCl2 two experimental designs were developed: one for CPL and another for JAJ.
3.4.1	Optimization of sulfate removal from carob pulp liquor using a statistical experimental design
The effects of BaCl2 concentration and exposure time on sulfate removal from carob pulp liquor were studied. Table 5 shows the results of experiments following a surface response methodology according to the Doehlert distribution for two factors (Doehlert., 1970). The data obtained from the application of the experimental design were further used for regression analysis and the polynomial model-derived parameters (p0 to p22) are displayed in Table 6. The p parameters of the polynomial models (when using coded units varying from -1 to +1) utilized to estimate the responses have precise meanings: p0 represents the analyzed response in the center of the experimental domain; the magnitude of pl and p2 indicates the importance of the respective
factors (concentration and time, respectively) on the responses; the interaction parameter, p12, indicates how the effect of one factor depends on the level of the other factor. The values of p11 and p22 determine how the response surface folds downward (negative values) or upward (positive values) quadratically, more or less rapidly depending on the magnitude of the absolute value.
Analyzing the data in Table 5 considering the exposure time of 21h, the addition of growing concentrations of BaCl2 to the carob pulp liquors results in successive decreases of sulfate concentration (tests 1 through 6). The addition of 0.25 % and 0.50 % of BaCl2 decreases in average 17.2 % and 66.0 % of the sulfate in the broth, respectively. Within this data set sulfate decreased linearly with the addition of BaCl2. The rate of decrease was of 64.8 mg/l of sulfate per BaCl2 percent unit. Similarly, considering the exposure time of about 34 h, the increasing BaCl2 concentrations, 0.125 % and 0.375 %, allowed sulfate precipitation of 7.6 % and
65.8	%, respectively. An exposure time of 8 h for the same BaCl2 concentrations showed the achievement of
5.5	% and 41.5 % of sulfate precipitation levels, respectively. Thus, these results indicate that a BaCl2 concentration of 0.125 % is not enough to obtain significant sulfate precipitation, independently of the exposure time.

2	0.25	21.00	41.64

13	0.125	33.99	47.35
14	0.125	33.99	43.45
However, this data set also highlight that the exposure time plays a role in the process. For BaCl2 concentration of 0.375 %, the increase of the exposure time from 8 h to 34 h (see tests 7, 8, 11 and 12 in
Considering the Table 5, the data suggests an important role of the amount of BaCl2 in the reduction of sulfate concentration in carob pulp liquors as compared with exposure time. The relative importance of BaCl2 concentration and the exposure time towards sulfate concentration is given by the value of p parameters in the regression equation (Table 6). The value of p1 for sulfates is fivefold higher than p2 meaning that the time of exposure is fivefold less influential to the final sulfate concentration than the amount of BaCl2 used in the process. The relative difference of p values affects the results of the experiments shown in Table 6. The presence of greater amounts of BaCl2 allows a more reduced time in the process of sulfate precipitation but the correct level of each factor is paramount in the definition of the optimal factor values. In this sense the magnitude of p12 (interaction between BaCl2 concentration and time) provides information about how the two factors, together, contribute to the response. p12 is higher than p2 meaning that it is important to carefully define a value for each factor. The response surface shown in Figure 5 displays the variation of sulfate concentration within the experimental domain.

The importance of BaCl2 on the response is expressed by the vertical lines on the response surface: a small variation of BaCl2 concentration produces a response in the sulfate concentration. The vertical lines are less stressed in the areas built by the higher values of both factors. Thus, to obtain a carob pulp liquor with minimal

3.4.1.1	Analysis of experimental data
Statistical validation of the polynomial equations was made by analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Deming and Morgan, 1987). The adequacy of the models to fit the sets of data was performed using two statistical tests: (i) the F-test for the effectiveness of the factors which detects whether the source of variance, included in the residuals, is due to the inadequacy of the models to reproduce experimental data; and (ii) the F-test for the lack of fit, that is performed in order to detect if the origin of the variance was due to experimental error. Table 6 shows the Fisher variation ratios and levels of confidence evaluated for each F-test. F-test for the effectiveness of the factors applied to sulfate concentration showed a level of confidence at which the null hypothesis (H0) can be rejected of 0.01 %. Thus, with a good level of confidence it can be assumed that a significant amount of variance in the data has been represented by the factors in the models, i.e. the factors, as they appear in the model, do have an effect upon the responses analyzed.
The F-ratio for the lack of fit also seems to be highly significant for sulfate concentration, as the null hypothesis can be rejected with a level of confidence of 0.01 %. In these conditions, the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is accepted, which means that the lack of perfect prediction of the models is explained by the experimental error. All the models fit well the sets of data. Model analysis by the coefficient of multiple
2
determination (R ) was also performed (Table 6). This coefficient shows that only a limited amount of the sum of squares corrected for the mean is accounted for by the residuals (3 %).
3.4.1.2	Desulfurization evaluation using carob pulp liquor treated with BaCl2
The carob pulp liquors, obtained from the seven different conditions of the experimental design (see Table 3), were all tested to evaluate how the sulfate removal affects the DBT desulfurization by G. alkanivorans strain 1B (Figure 6). The production of 2-HBP was observed only in three of these conditions, namely: 0.5 % of BaCl2 for 21 h, and 0.375 % of BaCl2 for 8 h and 34 h. From these, 0.5 % of BaCl2 for 21 h was the most efficient condition producing the higher quantity of 2-HBP (237 pM), which support the results of the experimental design (Fig. 5). For lower concentrations of BaCl2 (0.125 %, 0.25 %), independently of the time tested, no desulfurization occurred (Fig. 6).
These results showed that most of the conditions were unable to remove the sulfate to levels that allowed desulfurization. However, based on the sulfate levels measured by HPLC and the IC50 calculated previously (13.6 mg/l), there should have been some desulfurization in all the assays. This may indicate the presence of other sulfur sources, besides sulfate, that may affect desulfurization of DBT. As previously stated, when using agro-industrial materials as carbon sources for biodesulfurization these problems should be expected, since there is little control over the amount of sulfur rich compounds present in these residues, such as amino acids that have been proved to inhibit desulfurization (Mohebali et al., 2008). This experimental design highlights that 0.5 % of BaCl2 and a time of exposure of 21 h were adequate conditions for the sulfate removal from carob pulp liquor regarding its effective utilization in BDS, but in order to achieve zero sulfates it becomes
G. alkanivorans strain 1B in terms of 2-HBP production. All the values are means of at least three replicates, and the error bars indicate standard deviations
3.4.2	Optimization of sulfate removal from Jerusalem artichoke juice using a statistical experimental design
The sulfur contents of JAJ are almost ten times greater than those found on CPL so, in order to remove such amounts, it became necessary to further optimize the treatment. Based on the maximum precipitation conditions determined for CPL, 36 hours were determined as the fixed period of exposure, since longer exposure times would become impractical. It was then necessary to experiment with another parameter, in this case pH, since several studies have shown that pH levels have great influence on the formation and precipitation of barium sulfate (Rudie et al., 2006).
The effect of BaCl2 concentration and the juice's pH on sulfate removal from Jerusalem artichoke was studied using the same methods as for CPL (Table 5). Like previously observed, the addition of greater amounts of BaCl2 reduces the final concentration of sulfate (tests 1 through 6). At pH 7, the rate of sulfate reduction is
383.8	mg/l per each percent unit of BaCl2.
Table 7- Experimental design and the obtained response (residual sulfate concentration in Jerusalem artichoke juice) throughout the domain under study. Experiments performed in duplicated for statistical analysis.
Test	Design		Responses
	BaCl2 (% w/v)	PH	Sulfate (mg/l)
1	0.375	7	34.05
2	0.375	7	24.73
3	0.63	7	3.95
4	0.63	7	4.84
5	0.125	7	198.54
6	0.125	7	198.81
7	0.5	8.73	10.00
8	0.5	8.73	11.70
9	0.25	5.27	192.03
10	0.25	5.27	191.23
11	0.5	5.27	26.26
12	0.5	5.27	31.02
13	0.25	8.73	59.21
14	0.25	8.73	59.02
When the concentration of BaCl2 is doubled at pH 5.27 (tests 9 - 12) and pH 7 (tests 1 - 4), the amount of final sulfate concentration drops a value between 6.7 and 7.1 times. At pH 8.73 (tests 7, 8, 13 and 14) the final sulfate concentration drops 5.5 times indicating a less efficient activity at this pH.
pH also shows a relevant effect on the responses. For low concentrations of BaCl2 (tests 9, 10, 13 and 14) increasing pH from 5.27 to 8.73 decreases the sulfate 3.2-fold. For higher concentrations of BaCl2 (tests 7, 8, 11 and 12) the same range of pH change leads to a 2.6-fold drop in sulfate.
The relative importance of the factors on the responses is well represented by the values of the p factors in the linear models. In fact, the contribution of BaCl2 concentration (p1 = - 99.97) towards sulfate reduction is twice as important as pH (p2 = -43.39) contribution. The interaction of both factors (p12 = 66.23) shows a positive input in the response (final sulfate concentration) in opposition with the trend of the individual factors. This indicates a lower efficiency of high concentrations BaCl2 at highly alkaline pH, as demonstrated in tests 7, 8, 13 and 14.

The response surface in Figure 7 shows the variation of sulfate concentration within the limits of the experimental domain. The vertical lines show that the relative weight of BaCl2 on the concentration of sulfate is more influent than pH. In fact, a small variation of BaCl2 concentration produces a great response in the sulfate concentration. The lower quadrants show that small concentrations of BaCl2 seem to be less effective at acidic pH. In accordance, the lower left quadrant shows the highest values of sulfate concentration. This
value decreases as both pH and BaCl2 increase to obtain a minimum value of sulfates at pH = 7 (code 0) and BaCl2 = 0.5 - 0.55 % (code 0.5 - 0.7). The response surface profile is consistent with the values of p1 and p2 for sulfate (Table 8); however, the rate of concentration changes more rapidly when approaching the lower sulfate level.
3.4.2.1	Analysis of experimental data
Statistical validation was performed as stated for CPL in section 3.4.1.1. Table 8 shows the Fisher variation ratios and levels of confidence evaluated for each F-test.
F-test for the effectiveness of the factors applied to sulfate concentration showed a level of confidence of 0.01 %, at which the null hypothesis (H0) can be rejected Thus, with a good level of confidence, it can be assumed that a significant amount of variance in the data has been represented by the factors in the models, i.e. the factors, as they appear in the model, do have an effect upon the responses analyzed.
The F-ratio for the lack of fit also seems to be highly significant for sulfate concentration, as the null hypothesis can be rejected with a level of confidence of 0.025 %. In these conditions, the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is accepted. The lack of perfect prediction of the models is explained by the experimental error. All the models fit well the sets of data.

Model analysis by the coefficient of multiple determination (R ) was also performed (Table 8). This coefficient shows that only a limited amount of the sum of squares corrected for the mean is accounted for by the residuals (1 %).
3.4.2.2	Desulfurization evaluation using Jerusalem artichoke juice treated with BaCl2
The seven juices resulting from the different test conditions were used as carbon sources to test the effects of the treatments on the actual BDS process by G. alkanivorans strain 1B. The consumption of DBT and production of 2-HBP occurred on all of the conditions as shown on Figure 8 (a and b). Analyzing the consumption of DBT, the treatment with 0.125 % BaCl2, pH 7 proved to be the less efficient, with 154 pM of remaining DBT by 144 hours followed by both the acidic treatments 0.25 and 0.5 % BaCl2 (83 and 34 pM respectively). The most efficient were clearly the alkaline treatments, 0.25 and 0.5 % BaCl2, which by 72 hours had 18 and 43 pM DBT, respectively. Production-wise, the treatment with 0.125 % BaCl2, pH 7 was once again the worst, with a maximum of only 181 pM 2-HBP, followed by both acidic treatments with 264 pM and the treatment with 0.25 % pH 8.73 with 275 pM. The most efficient treatments were the remaining three, with very similar values, the treatment with 0.5 % BaCl2, pH 8.73 achieved a maximum of 353 pM and the treatments with 0.375 and 0.65 %, pH 7 reached 353 pM and 328 pM, respectively. The obtained results weren't entirely in accordance with the results of the experimental design. The lowest BDS results belonged to a juice with a weaker treatment with a high concentration of sulfate, which is expected; however, there should be a bigger difference between both acidic treatments since one has almost 200 mg/l of sulfate and the other ~30 mg/l. Moreover, taking into account both fastest the DBT consumption and the maximum 2-HBP production, the treatment with the best potential was BaCl2 0.5 % pH 8,3, and not the one with the lowest
concentration influencing the BDS process, this is once again the result of using complex carbon sources.

Figure 8- Effect of the seven treatments of Jerusalem artichoke juice, with BaCl2, in the DBT desulfurization process by G. alkanivorans strain 1B in terms of DBT consumption (a) and 2-HBp production (b). All the values are means of at least three replicates, and the error bars indicate standard deviations.
The results also seem to be in disagreement with the ones obtained for sulfates inhibition. According to them there should be no desulfurization when using the juices with higher concentration of sulfates (tests 5, 6, 9, 10, 13 14). However, the sugar concentration in the juices was more than twice the one used on the inhibition assays; this resulted in much higher biomass production, which could account for a larger need of sulfur, thus explaining the lower inhibitory effect.
The analysis of all the data on this experimental design shows that a concentration of zero sulfate can be achieved with 0.5 - 0.55 % (w/v) BaCl2 at pH 7. However analysis of the actual BDS shows better results when using alkaline pH, thus the optimal condition was determined to be 0.5% (w/v) BaCl2 at a pH of 8.73.
During this treatment an accumulation of barium sulfates can occur, which can constitute an environmental problem in a large scale BDS application; however, this drawback can become an economic advantage because barium sulfates can be recovered at end of the process and be used for further applications, such as

Carob pulp liquor is commonly used in several bioprocesses because of its high sugar concentration. Due to its relatively low sulfate concentration and high fructose content it also becomes a potentially interesting carbon source for biodesulfurization with G. alkanivorans strain 1B.
To test effectiveness of this liquor for BDS, batch assays were conducted using the liquor to obtain 25 g/l total concentration of glucose, fructose and sucrose with 400 pM initial DBT. Figure 9a represents cellular growth and 2-HBP production by the strain 1B during this assay. Maximum optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was 4.9
-1
at 144 h and the pmax was 0.1099 h- . In terms of desulfurization, 2-HBP production started at around 20 h, achieving its maximum of 50 pM by 93 h. The maximum production rate was of 1.30 pM/h, while the q2-HBP
-1 -1
was of 0.43 pmol g-1 (DCW) h-1. This reduced level of production reveals the abundance of sulfate or other easy access sulfur sources. As Fig. 9a shows a great part of the biomass was formed without the production of 2-HBP. In fact, by 15 h, OD600 was already at 2.18, almost half of the maximum OD600 (4.9), with no evidence of desulfurization. These results accentuate the need for optimization of the liquor.
The next step was to submit the liquor to an acidic hydrolysis, with the intention of converting the sucrose (51 % of the sugar content) into glucose and fructose. As a result, there was an increase of glucose and fructose, which reached 40 %, however there was also a loss in the amount of total sugars (dropping from 339 to 299 g/l). This hydrolysis should contribute to an increase of the specific rates, since the cell no longer needs to spend energy and nutrients on the enzymatic pathway to metabolize this sugar. Once again, this liquor was used in assays as the single carbon source to obtain 25 g/l total concentration of glucose and fructose with 400 pM initial DBT. Its potential for BDS was tested and the results for both cellular growth and 2-HBP production are shown in Figure 9b. The behavior of the culture was very similar to the non-hydrolyzed version. The maximum OD600 of 4.9 was achieved after 98 h, with no visible lag phase and a pmax of 0.0916 h-
1
. This slight increase of the growth rate could be the result of the easier access to the carbon source. Even so this treatment had a greater positive effect on desulfurization. 2-HBP reached detectable concentrations by 18 h, with a maximum value of 84 pM by 66h and its maximum production rate was of 3.85 pM/h with a q2-HBP of
-1 -1
1.57 pmol g- (DCW) h- . This was a significant increase with the maximum specific production rate raising more than 3-fold. However, like before, the sulfate or other easy access sulfur sources could be limiting the BDS abilities of the strain.
The final step was to remove the sulfate from the liquor using BaCl2, to prevent some inhibition of the BDS process. To do this, the optimal conditions determined by experimental design were applied to the hydrolyzed liquor. The treatment was very effective in removing the sulfates, reducing their concentration from 49 to 0
hydrolyzed CPL (b) and hydrolyzed CPL treated with BaCl2 in optimal conditions as the single carbon source. All results were obtained in triplicate. Standard deviation is indicated by the error bars.
Growth assays were conducted in batch mode with the treated liquor as the single carbon source (25 g/l of fructose and glucose) and 400 pM of DBT. The results for cellular growth and 2-HBP production are shown on Figure 9c. After 92 hours the culture reached a maximum OD600 of 4.9 and its pmax was of 0.0595 h- . This reduction of the pmax could be explained by the absence of easy access sulfur sources, which forces the bacteria to use the DBT, thus spending resources in the metabolic pathway, which would otherwise be used for cellular growth. Analysis of the desulfurization activity reveals that the production of 2-HBP began in the first 17 hours, and its maximum of 117 pM was obtained after only 70 h. Maximum production rate was of 3.27
-1 -1
pM/h with a q2-HBP of 1.56 pmol g- (DCW) h- , and for every gram of consumed sugar an average of 8 pmol of 2-HBP were produced.
When comparing the three liquors it becomes clear that the treatments were successful and led to the improvement of the BDS process. While it is true that both the non-hydrolyzed and hydrolyzed liquor presented greater growth rates, the analysis of Figure 9 will prove that “optimal” liquor is the best for the BDS process. When grown with this liquor, the strain had a lower maximum growth rate and its 2-HBP production rates were roughly the same as the hydrolyzed liquor. However since there were no easy access sulfur sources in the medium, desulfurization started much earlier, and by 17 h 2-HBP concentration was already 10 pM, which is 30% higher than that obtained for the hydrolyzed liquor one hour later. This resulted in a final 2-HBP concentration ~28 % higher and thus in a more effective desulfurization.
The results obtained with the liquor were, however, less promising than those with fructose. In all of them the growth stopped before the exhaustion of the carbon source, remaining 4, 9.5 and 10.9 g/l in the broth with pure, hydrolyzed and “optimal” liquors, respectively, without depleting the sulfur source and with no lag phase to indicate any inhibitory effect. Multiple approaches were used to try to solve this problem, such as: i) extraction of the liquor at 4 °C, to limit the presence of inhibitors; ii) use of other carob kibbles, since these were from a new batch and the results obtained in the experimental design were somewhat better; iii) use of activated charcoal, as a filter to remove possible inhibitors. However the final result remained the same.
The explanation could be related to the variable abundance of weak short chain lipophilic acids in CPL, such as acetic acid or butyric acid in the carob pods (Berna et all., 1997). These acids even in small concentrations are known to cause inhibition of bacterial growth. When in their undissociated form, these acids present a great solubility on the cell membrane, penetrating into the cytoplasm where they dissociate and release protons, causing a toxic effect, by lowering the internal cellular pH (Booth 1985, Roseiro 1991). As a response, the cells promote a detoxification mechanism based on ATPase inversion, which start to function as proton pumps, spending ATP to expel protons (Warth 1988). On a small scale this should have almost no practical effect on the culture. However, as the number of proton pumps rises, the amount of available ATP decreases and cellular metabolism lowers, which could even cause an abrupt stop of the growth. The acid percentage which is in its undissociated form is dependent on the pH of the culture. At values close to 7.5 these shouldn’t represent much danger. However, as the pH drops and approaches the pKa the weak acids become extensively undissociated and cause the referred toxic effects on the cells (Esgalhado et al., 1996).
Figure 10- Flow cytometric analyses of G. alkanivorans stained simultaneously with CFDA and PI, grown on DBT (i, ii, iii) as the sulfur source. Analyzed cells were at different physiological states: healthy exponential growing cells (i), cells submitted to starvation for several days (ii) and dead cells (iii). Three subpopulations can be differentiated: (A) viable cells, (B) stressed or injured cells and (C) dead cells
Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the physiological response of G. alkanivorans cells to the stress growth conditions generated by the presence of alternative carbon sources in the medium. Figure 10 shows a series of controls for G. alkanivorans strain 1B using 5 g/l of fructose as carbon source and 200 pM of DBT as sulfur source, stained with both CFDA and PI. The obtained results allowed the differentiation of four subpopulations: viable cells (A) (CFDA +, PI-), stressed or injured cells (B) (CFDA+, PI+), cells with permeabilised cytoplasmic membranes(C) (CFDA -, PI+), and intact cells with compromised enzymatic activity (D) (CFDA-, PI-). Exponential growing cells (i) were stained mainly with CFDA (78.5 %), some were stained with PI (3 %),or with both dyes (9.7 %) and 8.8 % were unstained. In the starved culture (ii) the proportion of PI+ cells (CFDA- and CFDA+) was much higher (64.2 %) compared to the exponential growing cells density plot (i), indicating, as expected, a more compromised culture. Ethanol-killed cells (iii) only showed a small percentage of unstained cells 5 % and cells with fluorescence emission for PI 94.4 % (PI+ cells)
Figure 11 shows the flow cytometric analyses of cells taken during the evolution of a strain 1B culture grown with carob pulp liquor as the carbon source (25 g/l total sugars) and 400 pM of DBT as the sulfur source. Fig. 11a, depicts the density plot of cells taken from the middle of the exponential phase, showing a large percentage of healthy cells (42.0 %) and almost no permeabilised cells (4.2 %), as expected. However, from the observation of Fig. 11b, concerning cells taken from the stationary phase, it was revealed that there were almost no events in the upper right quadrant (injured cells) (1.1 %), and the proportion of permeabilised cells was only 13.2 %,suggesting that cell permeability did not occur, at least in a high extension, in this early stationary phase. However, a massive increase in the percentage of cells in the lower left quadrant (D) (68.6 %) was observed. This could represent an increase of uncompromised metabolically inactive cells, which wouldn't be stained with CFDA or PI. If so, these results would be in accordance with the effects of the
lipophilic acids, thus explaining the unpredicted stop of the culture. At the start of the growth assay, with pH close to 7.5, most of the weak acids are in dissociated form. However, as the growth progresses, the external
pH lowers to values below 5.5 which are much closer to the pKa of the weak acids, resulting in high
concentrations of the undissociated forms. This in turn
would lead to reduction of the growth rate and an
eventual stop of the bacterial growth.

3.5.2	Strawberry tree fruit
At first, strawberry tree fruit seemed like a potentially viable alternative carbon source. It presented high sugar content, with a great percentage of fructose, and relatively small sulfate concentration (Table 3). Nonetheless it already had one problem, the impossibility of sulfates removal with BaCl2. The STFJ was used as carbon source in a batch assay to obtain 25 g/l total concentration of glucose, fructose and sucrose with 400 pM initial DBT. Figure 12 represents the growth and 2-HBP production by the strain 1B.
As the Figure 12 shows, the bacteria were unable to sustain a long time growth curve. Even though the growth achieves a pmax of 0.087 h, it had an abrupt stop at 24 hours. During this period there was no production of detectable 2-HBP, nor was the carbon source fully consumed, with 16 g/l remaining. This sudden stop of the growth can be explained by an acidic choc that probably kills the majority of the cell population. In fact, at 24 h the registered pH was 3.02, this is well below the limit the bacteria can handle (approximately 5). Moreover tests done with STFJ showed that it has a strange reaction to variations of pH. When pH is above 7, it reacts in the same way as with BaCl2, turning into a jelly. When pH is falls below 6, is rapidly lowers to values close to 3. Immediately after the inoculation, the medium's pH was around 7.5, but as the bacterial culture entered the exponential phase, the pH dropped to values close to 6 at which time the reported effect of STFJ acted suddenly lowering the pH to 3.

A flow cytometry analysis of a similar growth confirms the abrupt death of most of the cells with a pH of 3.01. Figure 13a shows the physiological states of G. alkanivorans cells during an assay with 400 pM DBT, as the sulfur source, and 25 g/l total sugars, from STFJ. After 16 hours of growth, there was a low proportion of injured cells (3.7 %), around 9 % of cells with permeabilised membranes, 15 % of active cells, and a high proportion of metabolically inactive cells (71.5 %), which, as previously noted, is a known response to acidic stress.
At 40 hours (Figure 13b), after the culture stopped growing, approximately 85 % of the cells were either injured (19.1 %) or permeabilised (65.6 %) and only 5.7 % remained active and healthy, supporting the hypothesis that the extremely low pH was responsible for their damage.
In order to minimize the effects of the STFJ on the pH, a new desulfurization assay was conducted using a smaller concentration of the juice, the equivalent of 10 g/l of the analyzed sugars, maintaining the DBT concentration of 400 pM. The results are shown on the Figure 14.

Figure 14- Time-course of the desulfurization of 400 pM DBT by G. alkanivorans strain 1B with 10 g/l of sugars from STFJ as the single carbon source. All results were obtained in triplicate. Standard deviation is indicated by the error bars.
This time the bacteria were able to grow in a regular manner, achieving a maximum OD600 of 2.6 at 64 hours and a pmax of 0.0523 h- with the carbon source fully consumed by the end of the growth. Analyzing the desulfurization during the first hours of growth there was no 2-HBP production, which is a symptom of the sulfate present in the medium. Only after 22 hours there was an appearance of 2-HBP, reaching its top value
-1 -of 146 pM by 94 hours. Maximum production rate was of 7.38 pM/h and the q2-HBP was of 5 pmol g- (DCW) h-
1
. DBT wasn't fully consumed remaining more than 31 % (125 pM) of the original concentration, which is expected since carbon is limiting, however the bacteria produced on average 15 pmol of 2-HBP for each gram of consumed sugar.
Even though the strain 1B was able to use strawberry tree fruit to desulfurize, it presents several problems which would make using it on an industrial level somewhat complicated, becoming a less attractive option for the BDS process.
3.5.3	Jerusalem artichoke
Jerusalem artichoke juice is, amongst the three sources, the one with greatest potential to grow the strain 1B, because, once hydrolyzed, it has the highest levels of fructose. However it is also the one in which treatments are most needed in for it order to be used in BDS.
Untreated, non-hydrolyzed juice was used as the single carbon source in a DBT biodesulfurization assay, as to obtain approximately 25 g/l of total reducing sugars in the growth medium. As Figure 15a shows, there was some cellular growth, with a maximum OD600 of 4.72 after 39 hours, and a pmax of 0.0546 h- . During this time there was also no production of 2-HBP. These results were expected, since the bacteria cannot use inulin as a carbon source, and all the other sugars were in small concentrations (approximately 4g/l at the beginning), being fully consumed by 47 hours. Desulfurization was also not expected since the sulfate present in the juice (451 mg/l) was more than enough for this level of cellular growth.
The next step was of course to promote the acidic hydrolysis of the inulin in the juice in order to make the fructose available to the bacteria. This treatment caused a great increase of the sugars content in JAJ (from ~22 to 145 g/l) with fructose concentration reaching 115 g/l (~80 % of the total). Fig. 15b shows the progress of a BDS assay using 400 pM DBT and approximately 25 g/l of glucose and fructose from the hydrolyzed juice, as the only carbon source. Unlike the previous assay, this time there was a greater cellular growth, a
-1
maximum OD600 was obtained at 91 h with a value of 13.15 and the pmax was of 0.0816 h- , with total sugar consumption by the end of the growth. The results of the desulfurization, however, remained: by the end of the growth no detectable 2-HBP had been produced, which was expected since there were still large quantities of sulfate in the juice, enough to even sustain the growth of the culture to these levels.
In order to make the BDS process possible, it became necessary to remove the sulfate present in the juices, so the optimal precipitation conditions (0.5 % BaCl2, 8.73 pH), determined through the experimental design assays, were applied to both juices (hydrolyzed and non-hydrolyzed). The treatment greatly reduced sulfates concentration from 451 to 11 mg/l. Non-hydrolyzed JAJ treated with BaCl2 shows a significant decrease on total sugars (from 22 to 4 g/l); contrary to the observed in the hydrolyzed JAJ treated with BaCl2 which revealed no substantial alteration on sugar levels (from 140 to 145 g/l total sugars).
The two resulting juices were then used as carbon sources for desulfurization of DBT (400 pM) by the strain 1B. The sugar concentrations were approximately 25 g/l of fructose and glucose for the hydrolyzed juice, and the equivalent taking into account the inulin for the non-hydrolyzed. The results are shown on Fig. 15c and d. Both assays revealed the production of 2-HBP, however their growth curves were very different. The bacteria grown using non-hydrolyzed juice, with approximately 1 g/l of consumable sugars, achieved a maximum
-1
OD600 of only 2.40 at 66 h and their pmax was of 0.0428 h- . 2-HBP production was already registered at 18
hours reaching a maximum concentration of 43 pM by the end of the growth. The maximum production rate was of 1.74 pM/h and the q2-HBP was 1.23 pmol g- (DCW) h- . These results show that the treatment was very effective, since even this small growth resulted in the production of 2-HBP, meaning that the remaining sulfate was so residual it wasn't enough to sustain this small need for sulfur, and thus no inhibition of the BDS process was observed. When grown with the treated and hydrolyzed juice (Fig. 15d), the bacteria reached a
-1
maximum OD600 of 15 after 96 h, presenting a pmax of 0.06 h- , with total consumption of the carbon source by the end of the growth. Production of 2-HBP was also registered at 18 hours, but its maximum concentration was much higher, reaching approximately 400 pM of 2-HBP between 73 and 96 hours, which resulted from total consumption of the DBT. The culture's maximum production rate was of 28.2 pM/h and its q2-HBp was
-1 -1
5.06 pmol g- (DCW) h- . The consumption of each gram of sugar resulted on an average production of 16 pmol of 2-HBP.
A flow cytometry analysis was also conducted for a BDS assay in similar conditions. The results in Figure 16 show the culture's state in the middle of exponential phase.
Figure 15- Time-course of the desulfurization of 400 pM DBT by G. alkanivorans strain 1B with 25 g/l total sugars of JAJ (a), hydrolyzed JAJ (b), JAJ treated with BaCl2 in optimal conditions (c) and hydrolyzed JAJ treated with BaCl2 in optimal conditions (d) as the single carbon source. All results were obtained in triplicate. Standard deviation is indicated by the error bars.
2-HBP (pM)	2-HBP (pM)
It can be seen on Figure 16 that 55.6% of G. alkanivorans cells were healthy, and 1.2 % were permeabilised, a result very similar to the control obtained for fructose (Fig. 10i).
Figure 16- Flow cytometric analyses of G. alkanivorans stained simultaneously with CFDA and PI, grown on DBT as the sulfur source and JAJ, hydrolyzed and treated with BaCl2, as the carbon source, with 25 g/l total sugars. Analyzed cells were harvested during the exponential phase. Results were obtained in duplicate and each analyzed in triplicate
By comparing the results obtained with the four juices, it becomes clear that the treatments were very successful. The hydrolysis led to an increase in maximum biomass, from 3.52 and 1.52 g/l DCW to 7.84 and 7.94 g/l DCW (treated and untreated, respectively). The treatment with BaCl2 led to the production of 2-HBP which was unachievable in the untreated juices. A decrease of the pmax was observed as a result of the treatment, from 0.0546 h-1 to 0.0428 h-1 in the non-hydrolyzed juices and from 0.0816 h-1 to 0.06 h-1 in the hydrolyzed ones. This might be explained by the presence of the sulfates, since they represent an easy access sulfur source, allowing for a smaller energy cost when comparing with DBT.
After its treatments, JAJ presents itself as a good potential carbon source, allowing high 2-HBP production rates without major inhibitors or complications.
3.5.4	Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation
3.5.4.1	Inulin
An alternative to the acidic hydrolysis of the inulin present in the Jerusalem artichoke would be to use enzymes to degrade it into fructose and glucose in a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). This process could bring some advantages, such as a gradual release of the monosaccharaides, preventing a possible inhibitory effect caused by excess carbon. Or a greater specificity, since the scope of its action is limited to the inulin molecules, unlike the acidic hydrolysis which can affect multiple compounds.
In this context, DBT desulfurization assays with G. alkanivorans strain 1B were carried out to screen the ability of this strain to grow and desulfurize DBT using commercial inulin (10 g/l) and JAJ (10 g/l reducing sugars) as the sole carbon source, with and without the presence of inulinases (Talf 1 crude enzymatic extract (Paixao et al., 2012)). Figure 17 shows the time course profile displaying the bacterial growth and desulfurization characteristics of G. alkanivorans strain 1B in batch cultures, with 10 g/l of inulin as the only carbon source and 200 pM of DBT as sulfur source, without the presence of inulinases (Fig. 17a) and supplemented with 3 % (v/v) Talf1 enzymatic extract (Fig. 17b).
17a). A low growth, with a pmax of 0.02 h- , occurred due to the presence of residual fermentable sugars in the commercial inulin, approximately 1 g/l of reducing sugars (sucrose, fructose and glucose). This growth was not sufficient for the bacterium to produce 2-HBP from DBT, because the strain used only the residual readily bioavailable sulfur compounds present in the commercial inulin, to grow due to the scarce carbon source available.
When 3 % of Talf1 enzymatic extract was added in a SSF process with the same desulfurization conditions, G. alkanivorans strain 1B was able to grow and desulfurize (Fig. 17b), presenting a maximum OD600 of 2.8 by
-1 -1
38 hours, a pmax of 0.08 h- , better than that obtained with fructose (0.070 h-). 2-HBP was first detected at 15 hours, achieving a top value of 139 pM by 42 hours. Maximum production rate was of 6.74 pM/h and a q2-HBP was of 5.88 pmol g-1 (DCW) h-1 (lower than fructose at 25g/l, 6.565 pmol g-1 (DCW) h-1). In this case the residual sulfur compounds present in the inulin were consumed before the available sugars, therefore the bacteria was forced to desulfurize DBT to obtain the necessary sulfur for the growth. In the first hours of the assay there was an accumulation of hydrolyzed monosaccharaides which were then completely consumed during the bacterial growth (Fig. 17b). These results demonstrated that even in temperature and pH
Figure 17- Growth and desulfurization characteristics of G. alkanivorans in batch cultures with 10 g/l of inulin as the only carbon source and 200 pM of DBT as the sulfur source, without the presence of inulinases (a) and supplemented with 3% Talf1 enzymatic extract (b). All results were obtained in triplicate. Standard deviation is indicated by the error bars.
3.5.4.2	Jerusalem artichoke
Once Talf1 enzymatic extract efficiently hydrolyzed pure inulin within BDS conditions, allowing the growth and desulfurization to occur, a second set of assays were performed testing the Jerusalem artichoke juice. Figure 18 shows the time course profile displaying the bacterial growth and desulfurization characteristics of G. alkanivorans strain 1B in batch cultures with untreated non-hydrolyzed JAJ (10 g/l reducing sugars), as the sole carbon source, and 400 pM of DBT, as sulfur source, without the presence of inulinases (Fig. 18a) and supplemented with 5 % (v/v) Talf1 enzymatic extract (Fig. 18b). A higher concentration of DBT was added in this set of assays, to guarantee that the sugars were all consumed without any sulfur limitation. A higher concentration of enzymatic extract (5 %) was also employed, to guarantee the efficient hydrolysis of JAJ, which may contain inulin fibers harder to hydrolyze than the commercial inulin.
As observed in the assay with pure inulin (Fig. 17a), there was no desulfurization and almost no bacterial growth in the batch cultures without the addition of inulinases (Fig. 18a), because strain 1B cannot metabolize
-1
inulin. A low growth, with a pmax of 0.03 h- and a maximum OD600 of 2.66 at 72 hours, occurred due to the presence of readily available fermentable sugars (~3 g/l) and sulfates in the natural juice (Fig. 18a). When 5 % of Talf1 enzymatic extract was added to the bacterial culture, both growth and desulfurization were observed (Fig. 16b). Again, there was an accumulation of hydrolyzed monosaccharaides in the first hours,
-1
which were completely consumed during the bacterial growth. The pmax was of 0.05 h- with a maximum OD600 of 8.06 at 42 hours and the 2-HBP maximum production rate was of 6.64 pM/h (Fig. 18b) with its production starting between 24 and 42 hours and reaching a maximum of 123 pM at 65 hours.
Figure 18- Growth and desulfurization characteristics of G. alkanivorans in batch cultures in diluted Jerusalem artichoke juice (10 g/l of reducing sugars) as the only carbon source and 400 |iM of DBT as the sulfur source, without the presence of inulinases (a) and supplemented with 5% Talf1 enzymatic extract (b).
As previously stated, the Jerusalem artichoke juice is very rich in sulfate that can inhibit the desulfurization and consequently decrease the 2-HBP production. So, the next step was to test the juice treated with BaCl2. Figure 19 shows the time course profile displaying the bacterial growth and desulfurization characteristics of G. alkanivorans strain 1B in batch cultures with non-hydrolyzed Jerusalem artichoke juice treated with BaCl2 (10 g/l reducing sugars) as the only carbon source and 400 pM of DBT as sulfur source, supplemented with 5% Talfl enzymatic extract.
Once again, when cultivated with 5 % of Talfl enzymatic extract, both growth and desulfurization were observed (Fig. 19). Accumulation of hydrolyzed monosaccharaides occurred in the first hours, being completely consumed during the course of the bacterial growth. The pmax was 0.1288 h- with a maximum OD600 of 6.18 at 66 hours. Analyzing the 2-HBP production, it was first detected at 25 h, achieved a maximum
-1
of 279 pM by 66 h and the maximum production rate was 16,8 pM/h while the q2-HBP was of 8.33 pmol g--1
(DCW) h- , translating into the production of 28 pmol of 2-HBP for each gram of consumed sugar.
Comparing both the growth rate and 2-HBP production between treated and untreated juices, it becomes clear that the treatment was effective: pmax was increased 2.6 times and maximum 2-HBP production rate went up
2.5	times. Even comparing with the pure source, the commercial inulin, these results proved to be much better. pmax was 1.6 times higher, maximum 2-HBP production was improved 2.5 times and maximum specific production rate went up 1.4 times. This increase in comparison with the pure source can be explained by the presence of extra nutrients other than carbon, in which the Jerusalem artichoke juice is rich. These nutrients could have supplemented the minimum medium used for the BDS assays contributing to a better performance
Figure 3- Growth and desulfurization characteristics of G. alkanivorans in batch cultures in diluted JAJ, hydrolyzed and treated with BaCl2 (10 g/l of reducing sugars), as the only carbon source and 400 PM of DBT as the sulfur source, supplemented with 5% Talf1 enzymatic extract All results were obtained in triplicate. Standard deviation is indicated by the error bars.
Studies with enzymatic extracts for degradation of complex carbon sources are rare on the BDS field. A separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) process was already applied successfully in BDS studies with this bacterium, testing hydrolyzates of recycled paper sludge (Alves et al 2008). That seems to be the only existing study, and this is the first time that a SSF process was applied, opening a new focus of research.
4.	CONCLUSIONS
The main goal of this work was to test different types of agro-industrial materials and assess the biodesulfurization ability by G. alkanivorans strain 1B viewing the selection and the optimization of BDS process for the most promising alternative carbon source.
In this context, and previously knowing that G. alkanivorans strain 1B is a fructophilic bacterium, fructose rich materials were selected, namely: carob pulp, strawberry tree fruits and Jerusalem artichoke tubers. These materials were used to produce sugar rich liquors and juices, which were optimized through acidic hydrolysis and treatments with BaCl2 for sulfate removal and further tested for DBT-desulfurization. The results obtained with the different liquors and juices prepared indicate that all the three raw materials have the potential to be used as alternative carbon sources in BDS processes by strain 1B.
However, this study showed that Jerusalem artichoke juice was the most promising alternative carbon source for both growth and DBT-desulfurization with the G. alkanivorans strain 1B. Using the optimized JAJ as the sole carbon source, no inhibitory effects were observed, having been achieved normal bacterial growth results, with the complete consumption of the carbon source and the 400 pM of DBT. The simple treatments applied to JAJ (sulfate removal with BaCl2 and acidic hydrolysis) were sufficient to allow desulfurization with levels very close to those obtained with commercial fructose, either in terms of: maximum 2-HBP produced (400 pM, achieved in similar times for both), 2-HBP production rate (31 pM/h for fructose and 28 pM/h for JAJ) and maximum 2-HBP production per gram of sugar consumed (17 pmol/g sugar for fructose and 16 pmol/g sugar for JAJ). The major difference seems to be that JAJ promotes greater biomass formation, reaching a maximum OD600 of 15, within 96 h, against a maximum OD600 of 12, within 117 to 161 h, for fructose. This fact
- -1
contributed to a slightly decrease of the q2-HBP in the juice, 5.06 pmol g-1 (DCW) h- , which in fructose was
- -1
6.565 pmol g-1 (DCW) h- . Furthermore, the application of Talf1 inulinases to JAJ in a SSF process, as an alternative approach to the acidic hydrolysis treatment, allowed the achievement of remarkable results, surpassing those obtained not only with the acid hydrolyzed JAJ but even with commercial fructose. The results from JAJ in a SSF with enzymes showed a pmax 1.84 times higher than with fructose and 2.15 times higher than with acid hydrolyzed JAJ, a q2-HBP 1.27 times higher for fructose and 1.65 times higher for the other JAJ, and a ratio of 2-HBP production per gram of sugar consumed 1.63 times higher for fructose and 1.74 times higher for the acid hydrolyzed JAJ.
Jerusalem artichoke may not be a residue of any particular industry, but the fact that it can grow on poor soils, exposed to very different climates, ranging from the very hot to the very cold, and is even resistant to contaminants of the soil and parasites, makes it very easy and cheap to produce, being available anywhere around the world. Moreover, since its sugar content is mostly inulin, it is less likely to be contaminated, being more easily stored.
To sum up, the Jerusalem artichoke juice is an excellent alternative carbon source that can prove to be a very valuable asset for the further acceptance of the biodesulfurization as an alternative or complement to the sulfur removal from crude oil. The promising results obtained in this study open a new focus of research
5.	FUTURE WORK
Future work will include continuous culture assays viewing a further optimization of desulfurization kinetics using the Jerusalem artichoke juice optimized as carbon source. Then it could be interesting to test model fuels to evaluate the desulfurization ability in the presence of multiple simultaneous compounds, such as the derivatives of DBT and benzothiophene. And an ultimate goal would be to conduct biodesulfurization assays on actual crude oil or gasoline/diesel, to determine the G. alkanivorans strain 1B potential to desulfurize in conditions usually found at industrial level.
