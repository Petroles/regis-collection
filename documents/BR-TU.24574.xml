RESUMO 

Cobertura florestal e qualidade da água de microbacias agrícolas tropicais 

As florestas tropicais estão sob constante ameaça devido ao processo de desmatamento e 

fragmentação florestal impulsionado pelo crescimento das atividades econômicas, em especial, a 

agricultura. A substituição de áreas florestadas por outros usos do solo pode causar impactos severos 

na qualidade da água de rios, alterando suas características físicas, químicas e biológicas. A Mata 

Atlântica, em especial, teve sua cobertura original reduzida a cerca de 11%, sendo que a expansão 

de terras cultiváveis e urbanização ainda ameaçam esse importante ecossistema e os serviços 

ecossistêmicos prestados por ele. Nesse sentido, este estudo propôs investigar a relação da cobertura 

florestal com a qualidade da água de microbacias agrícolas tropicais. Para tanto, foram selecionadas 

seis microbacias experimentais com diferentes porcentagens de cobertura florestal na bacia do rio 

Sarapuí, Estado de São Paulo, Brasil, onde foram feitas coletas de amostras de água por um ano 

hidrológico para a obtenção de parâmetros que representassem alterações na água induzidas por 

atividades antrópicas. Inicialmente as microbacias foram classificadas em “florestadas” e 

“degradadas”, e modelos estatísticos multivariados foram aplicados para identificar diferenças entre 

os grupos. Em um segundo momento comparou-se a relação do uso e cobertura do solo na 

microbacia e na Área de Preservação Permanente (APP) com a qualidade da água utilizando-se 

modelos mistos e análise de redundância para identificar os principais fatores que influenciam a 

variabilidade da qualidade da água. Por último foi gerado um modelo hidrológico para simular o 

impacto da restauração da floresta ripária na qualidade da água da bacia do rio Sarapuí onde cada 

microbacia experimental desse estudo foi representada por uma sub-bacia do modelo. Os resultados 

mostram que as microbacias degradadas apresentam valores maiores de sólidos, turbidez, nutrientes 

e coliformes. Além disso, apresentam maior variabilidade temporal dos dados em relação às 

microbacias florestadas associada às alterações da vazão do rio. Em geral, a cobertura florestal foi 

relacionada à boa qualidade da água, enquanto que agricultura e ocupação urbana foram os usos do 

solo responsáveis pela degradação da qualidade da água. O uso pastagem apresentou impactos 

mistos, porém no geral não foi correlacionado à qualidade da água ruim. Os parâmetros de qualidade 

da água responderam de forma diferente quanto à influência dos padrões de uso e cobertura do solo 

na microbacia e na APP, porém, considerando-se todos parâmetros em conjunto, a qualidade da água 

é melhor explicada pela composição da paisagem da microbacia. Ainda assim, a simulação do 

modelo indicou que a restauração das APPs reduz a carga de sedimentos e nutrientes para o rio. Com 

isso, conclui-se que a floresta tropical tem papel fundamental na conservação dos recursos hídricos, 

reduzindo impactos das atividades humanas exercidas nas microbacias e que, apesar da importância 

das APPs na redução de poluentes para o rio, o manejo de bacias com estratégias de restauração 

florestal para toda a microbacia é extremamente importante para a manutenção da qualidade da água 

para abastecimento.

ABSTRACT 

Forest cover and water quality in tropical agricultural watersheds 

Tropical forests are under continual threat due to deforestation and forest fragmentation 

processes which are driven by the economic activities growth, mainly agriculture. Replacing forest 

with other land uses can cause severe impacts on river water quality, altering its physical, chemical 

and biological characteristics. The Atlantic Forest, in particular, had its original vegetation cover 

reduced to about 11%, wherein the crop lands expansion and urban sprawl still threatening this 

important ecosystem and the ecosystem services that it provides. In this sense, the main objective of 

this study was to investigate the relation between forest cover and water quality of tropical 

agricultural watersheds. For that, six experimental watersheds with different percentage of forest 

cover were selected in the Sarapuí River watershed, State of São Paulo, Brazil. Water samples were 

collected during a hydrologic year to obtain water quality parameters that represent impacts induced 

by anthropic activities. According to the percentage of forest cover, the watersheds were 

denominated as “forested”, when they presented more than 55% of forest cover, and “degraded”, 

with less than 35%. Multivariate statistical models were applied to identify differences between 

these two groups. In a second moment, the relation of land use/land cover within the watershed and 

within its respective riparian zone, represented in this study by the Permanent Preservation Areas 

(PPA), with water quality was compared through mixed models and redundancy analysis to identify 

the main factors that influenced water quality variability. Lastly, a watershed simulation modeling 

was applied to verify the impact of riparian forest restoration on water quality of the Sarapuí River 

watershed, wherein each experimental watershed was represented by a sub-watershed in the model. 

The results showed that the degraded watersheds presented higher values of solids, turbidity, 

nutrients and coliforms, besides presenting greater temporal data variability compared to forested 

watersheds. This variation is associated with the stream flow changes during the year. In general, 

forest cover was related to good water quality, while agriculture and urban areas were responsible 

for the water quality degradation. Pasture presented mixed impacts, but it was not generally 

correlated with poor water quality. The water quality parameters responded differently to the 

influence of land-use/land-cover patterns in the watershed and riparian zone, but the overall water 

quality is better explained by the landscape composition within the watershed. Nevertheless, the 

watershed simulation indicated that PPA restoration reduces the sediment and nutrients loading into 

the river. Thus, it is possible to conclude that tropical forest plays a fundamental role in the water 

resources conservation, reducing impacts of human activities in watersheds and the watershed 

management with forest restoration strategies for the entire watershed is critical for the maintenance 

of water quality to water supply, despite the importance of the riparian zone.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Natural ecosystems play a crucial role in producing natural resources and controlling 

physical, chemical and biological processes worldwide, generating benefits for humans, the so-

called “ecosystem services”, such as food, fuel, fiber, climate regulation, pest control and 

drinking water. Water, in particular, is a natural resource imperative to life, to the natural cycles 

of the organisms, to the food production and the economic activities. This resource, however, 

is increasingly scarce due to the crescent demand associated with population growth, increasing 

in urbanization, agricultural frontier expansion, and the rapid development of economic 

activities. In addition, the intensification of natural ecosystems degradation is threatening the 

provision of water resources, especially drinking water. 

Declining water quality has become a global issue of concern as industrial and 

agricultural activities expand, and climate change threatens to cause serious alterations to the 

hydrological cycles. Many areas worldwide are experiencing problems with lack of drinking 

water due to the water bodies’ pollution coming from agricultural runoff, domestic sewage, 

industrial effluents, and atmospheric inputs from fossil fuel burning and bushfires. 

Land-use/land-cover composition has a strong influence on the water quality in 

watersheds, wherein different uses represent various degrees of risk to the water resources. The 

hydrological cycle and the water behavior reflects the land use, cover and conditions of the 

catchments, wherein surface runoff is a major source of non-point pollution and is primarily 

responsible for the relationship between land use/land cover and water quality. The conversion 

of forested areas to other uses, especially, has been associated with water quality deterioration. 

However, the non-point source water pollution is difficult to control, once it is not caused by 

an easily identified and regulated activity. 

Agricultural activities are essential for the food provision to the population, feeding 

animals, and biofuel, however, it is one of the main factors of deforestation, especially in 

tropical regions. Brazil has reported the greatest annual net loss of forest area in the world due 

to agricultural expansion. Cleaning forest areas to acreage expansion for new cultivation areas 

and inadequate agricultural practices generate direct and indirect impacts on stream water 

quality. Nonetheless, these impacts can vary according to the climate, hydrological 

characteristics, the region, and the physical aspects of the watershed. 

In this context, watershed management is essential to ensure the water resources 

protection, striking a balance between human activities and natural habitats conservation 



12 

through, for example, the maintenance of forest areas within the watersheds. However, many 

questions regarding the relation of forest conservation and water quality have not been resolved. 

Forest cover in different landscapes can have different impacts on water quality, as well as the 

forest configuration. For example, the importance of the riparian forests is often mentioned, but 

empirical studies that test its effectiveness in maintaining water clean are scarce and 

contradictory. 

We are facing the challenge of managing the immediate human needs and maintain 

long-term water supply capacity, as concern about the availability of this resource with good 

quality. Therefore, the water conservation depends on the conservation of other natural 

resources, and it requires plans that incorporate an integrated and holistic view of the ecosystem. 

Thus, studies that include the knowledge of how and at which scale forest conservation 

acts positively on the maintenance of water quality are of utmost importance for the 

understanding of the ecosystem services provided by the natural habitats in agricultural 

watersheds. This information can help polices design, forest conservation efforts, and forest 

restoration projects. 

This thesis comprises three chapters, which are complete manuscripts that address this 

issue. The first chapter gives us an overview of the relation between forest cover and water 

quality in agricultural tropical watersheds. The second chapter presents a comparison between 

the effects of land-use/land-cover patterns in the watershed and within the riparian zone on the 

water quality. The third chapter is a next step, where the effects of riparian restoration on water 

quality were modeled. Lastly, the final considerations, based on the results from the chapters.

2. INFLUENCES OF TROPICAL FOREST COVER ON WATER 

QUALITY IN AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS IN 

SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL 

Abstract 

Tropical forests are under continued threat due to deforestation and fragmentation, mainly 

because of clear-cutting for agriculture and cattle ranching, and it can lead to water quality 

degradation. However, there is a need for understanding the role of forest areas in the current diverse 

landscape in tropical watersheds. Thus, this study aimed at evaluating the importance of maintaining 

forest cover for water quality in tropical agricultural watersheds. We selected six watersheds of low-

order streams in Southeastern Brazil with different percentages of forest cover, where water samples 

were collected to obtain the following water quality parameters: dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity 

(NTU), total suspended solids (TSS), inorganic suspended solids (ISS), organic suspended solids 

(OSS), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TN), total coliforms (TC), and fecal coliforms (FC). 

A land use/land cover (LULC) map was used to extract the LULC pattern of each watershed, and a 

distance metric was applied to explore the differences between them. The water quality parameters 

were analyzed by the yearly mean, data variation and the correlation between them. We compared 

forested (55% of forest cover or more) and degraded (35% or less) watersheds using MANOVA and 

PCA. Degraded watersheds showed high values of solids, turbidity, nutrients and coliforms. The 

most forested watershed showed the best water quality, whereas the watershed mainly covered by 

agriculture presented the poorest water quality and the greatest temporal variation. The forested 

watersheds showed significant difference with degraded watersheds, which presented higher value 

of all the parameters, excepted of DO. NTU, solids, and TP were correlated, showing that turbidity 

and solids represent the particles in the water, and they carry adsorbed phosphorus. Those parameters 

also responded to the streamflow variation. The results indicated that water quality degradation is 

due to the agricultural and residential areas, whereas the tropical forest was important to keep water 

clean. Thus, tropical forest cover plays an important role in minimizing the impacts of human 

activities on ecosystem services in agricultural watersheds, but better soil management practices and 

basic sanitation implementation are still needed to improve water quality.

2.1. Introduction 

Tropical forests are under severe threat from logging and clearing mainly for 

agriculture (WWF, 2011), threatening the ecosystem services that are provided by these areas, 

including soil and water protection. Although the rate of global forest area net loss has slowed 

in the past five years as more forests are better managed, global rates of tropical deforestation 

increased from 5.6 to 9.1 Mha per year over the last two decades, especially in Africa and South 

America (WWF, 2011; FAO, 2016). In this context, Brazil reported the greatest annual net loss 

of forest area between 2010 and 2015 (FAO, 2016). Atlantic Forest, in particular, is a 

biodiversity hotspot (Mittermeier et al., 2011) that has been reduced to only 11% of its original 

cover (Ribeiro et al., 2009). 



14 

According to Hosonuma et al. (2012), commercial agriculture is the largest driver of 

deforestation in developing countries, followed by subsistence agriculture. Replacing forest 

with agriculture decreases water quality due to the erosion from croplands, excess amount of 

fertilizer and manure applications, higher animal stocking densities, channel erosion, 

constructional activities and wastewater (Ometo et al., 2000; Gergel et al., 2002; Erol and 

Randhir, 2013; Gunawardhana et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2016). In this way, keeping forest 

areas in agricultural watersheds can control the biogeochemical cycles, providing protection 

against erosion, retention of pollutants, excessive nutrients runoff and increased water 

temperature (Sweeney et al., 2004; Mingoti and Vettorazzi, 2011; Schilling and Jacobson, 

2014; Tanaka et al., 2016). 

It is well accepted that watersheds covered with natural forests mostly provide better 

water quality than watersheds with other land uses. For example, Knee and Encalada (2014) 

found that watersheds that have streams in protected forests tended to have better water quality 

than areas which are not under protection. Wang et al. (2013) associated forestland to good 

water quality comparing to farm and urban lands. Huang et al. (2016) also found that water 

quality parameters are strongly positively correlated with the proportion of forest areas. 

However, tropical forests, including Atlantic Forest, are today a mix of forest at many degrees 

of conservation interspersed with patches of agriculture or other uses (Ribeiro et al., 2009; 

Singh and Mishra, 2014; Chazdon, 2017). Clément et al. (2017) also found that the landscape 

diversity appeared to have a negative impact on water quality, and it seems to occur at certain 

thresholds. According to the authors, even in areas of intensive farming, streams with a forest 

area that covers at least 47% of the watershed have a better water quality than others with fewer 

forest areas. Nonetheless, the effects of the forest cover on water quality in tropical watersheds 

with a mixed agricultural landscape have not really been evaluated (Singh and Mishra, 2014).  

With an expected world population to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 (UN-Water, 2016), 

supplying water becomes a major issue related to drinking water in the world. We currently 

face the challenge of supplying the immediate population demands and, at the same time, ensure 

the long-term water supply capacity, assuring quantity and quality of this resource for the future 

generations. 

Accordingly, studies that evaluate how the tropical forests contribute positively to the 

water quality maintenance in the current diverse landscape are needed to help to understand the 

ecosystem services that are provided by the natural vegetation in agricultural watersheds, and 

its importance for the population. This information can assist the plans and future actions of 

forest conservation and restoration, and to design policies for water sources protection. 



15 

 

In this context, this study aimed at evaluating the importance of maintaining forest 

cover for water quality in tropical agricultural watersheds. The specific aims were: (1) to 

evaluate the water quality in watersheds with different percentages of forest cover; (2) to 

explore the relationship between forest cover and water quality variability; and (3) to assess the 

importance of forest cover in agricultural watersheds in keeping water clean. 

2.2. Materials and Methods 

2.2.1. Study area 

The study area is the Sarapuí River basin that includes six experimental watersheds. 

Sarapuí River is a tributary of Tiete River, located in the São Paulo State, southeastern Brazil 

(Figure 1), and it supplies four cities, providing water for domestic, agricultural and other 

purposes. It was originally covered by Atlantic Forest, where Dense Ombrophilous Forest is 

the predominant forest type (Oliveira-Filho and Fontes, 2000). The forest patches remaining 

are within a complex matrix composed by agriculture (at large and small scale), pasture, planted 

forest (Eucalyptus and Pinus), and urban areas. Agriculture is the backbone of the economy, 

especially the production of grains, fruits, and vegetables.  

The region is under the influence of Cwa climate (humid temperate with dry winters). 

Annual precipitation is between 1354.7 mm and 1807.7 mm (CEPAGRI, 2014), and the rain 

mostly falls from October to March.

Six watersheds (numbered S1 to S6) were selected based on physical characteristics 

and percentage of forest cover to establish the sampling sites. We selected watersheds of low-

order streams (3rd order) with similar area, shape, average slope, and soil types, but with 

varying forest cover, including three forested watersheds (more than 55% of forest cover – S1, 

S2 and S5) and three degraded watersheds (35% or less – S3, S4 and S6). According to Vannote 

et al. (1980), low-order streams (orders 1-3) are strongly influenced by terrestrial inputs. 

2.2.2. Data sources 

River network and a 5m-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from 

official topographic information (IGC, 1:10.000 scale) were used to delimit the watersheds. We 

employed the standard tools for hydrology and watershed, which are available in the GIS to 

delineate the six 3rd-order watersheds, basing on the sampling sites and the watershed areas 

upstream. 

Land-use/land-cover (LULC) data was extracted from SPOT satellite images (2.5m-

spatial resolution; panchromatic band, year: 2010) supplied by the Environment Secretariat of 

the São Paulo State, Environmental Planning Coordination (SMA-CPLA) by on-screen 

digitizing (1:8,000 scale) with ArcGIS 10.2 software. The follow LULC classes were pre-

defined, based on the technical manual on the land use of the Brazilian Institute of Geography 

and Statistics (IBGE, 2013): water, wetlands, forest, eucalyptus, agriculture, pasture and urban. 

In this study, agriculture represents the fast-growing vegetables, e.g. onion, potato, pumpkin, 

strawberry, and lettuce; urban represents the residential areas; pasture comprises grassland 

destined to livestock activity, even without cattle in the studied period; and forest represents the 

areas covered by native forest (Atlantic Forest). 

The map accuracy and agreement were measured through the confusion matrix and the 

kappa coefficient (Congalton and Green, 1998), based on 121 ground control points distributed 

along the six watersheds. We obtained 105 overall hits, which represents 87% of agreement, 

and a kappa coefficient of 0.83, indicating a very good accuracy of the LULC map (Rosner, 

2006). 

Nine water quality parameters, including dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity (NTU), 

total suspended solids (TSS), inorganic suspended solids (ISS), organic suspended solids 

(OSS), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total coliforms (TC), and fecal coliforms 

(FC), were chosen to represent the water quality in the sampling sites. The samples were 

collected at bi-weekly intervals during a hydrologic year (from October 2013 to October 2014) 

summing up 24 observations for each site. 



17 

 

DO was measured through an in-situ water quality detector (YSI 556 multiparameter 

system). Water samples were collected in duplicate to determine NTU, TN, TP, TSS, and OSS, 

which were kept refrigerated and transported to the laboratory for advanced analysis, following 

standard methods (APHA, 2005).  

NTU was obtained using an automatic turbidimeter (MS TEC – TB 1000). TN was 

determined by Kjeldahl digestion method (APHA, 2005) using an automatic digester (Buchi – 

K449). The spectrophotometric determination was applied to measure TP (APHA, 2005). The 

gravimetric analysis was used to obtain TSS, ISS and OSS (APHA, 2005), where 500 mL were 

filtrated for each sample. TSS is the total residue portion on the filter, ISS is the total solid 

portion that remains after the calcination, and OSS is the portion of the solids that is lost in the 

calcination process. TC and FC were detected by the multiple-tube technique with 100 mL 

sample (CETESB, 1993), and the results are given in Most Probable Number (MPN). We used 

Lactose Broth for the presumptive identification of coliforms, and the Brilliant Green Bile Broth 

for the confirmation and mensuration. 

    We also measured the streamflow (Q) using the current-meter method, that divides 

the stream channel cross section into various vertical subsections (Santos et al., 2001). In each 

subsection, the area was obtained by measuring the width and depth, and the water velocity was 

determined using a current meter (Global Water Flow Probe – 201). The total discharge was 

computed by summing the discharge of each subsection. 

2.2.3. Statistical analyses 

We applied a distance metric (Manhattan distance) to explore the differences in the 

LULC patterns between watersheds through the vegan package of the statistical software R (R 

Development Core Team, 2014). Manhattan distance between two items is the sum of the 

absolute values of the differences of their corresponding components (Shahid et al., 2009), and 

it is calculated by the equation 1. 

?(??) = ?(?[??] ? ?[??])

where d is the distance between two watersheds (j and k) and x is the value of the LULC 

percentage for each watershed. 

Mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation (CV=SD/x.100 %, where SD is 

the standard deviation and x is the mean) were calculated to obtain the water quality variables

pattern and variation between watersheds. The range of data values was categorized into three 

classes based on the natural breaks method to build a map of the water quality spatial variation. 

We performed a Pearson´s correlation to check for relations between water quality 

variables. The variables strongly correlated (r &gt; 0.9) were discarded from the next analysis. A 

linear regression was also applied to evaluate the relation between water quality and 

streamflow. The water quality variables were checked for normality and transformed, when it 

was necessary, using logarithm forms. 

A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) using the Hotelling-Lawley Trace 

was employed to check if the water quality was different between forested and degraded 

watersheds. The Hotelling-Lawley Trace is the multivariate equivalent of the t-test, whether the 

two vectors of means for the two groups (forested and degraded) are sampled from the same 

sampling distribution (Carey, 1998). 

The principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to check for groups between 

forested and degraded watersheds, also to identify the water quality variables that directed this 

result and the relation between them. 

The statistical analyses were performed using the software RStudio (RStudio Team, 

2014) and MVSP 3.22 (Kovach Computing Services, 2007).  

2.3. Results 

Among the forested watersheds, S5 showed the largest forest cover (75%) followed by 

S2 (57%) and S1 (55%) (Figure 2). On the other hand, S4, S6, and S3 presented, respectively, 

35%, 29%, and 25% of forest cover. Likewise, S4 had the largest agricultural area (54%), 

followed by S6 (33%), S3 (29%), S1 (27%) and S2 (23%), whereas the S5 had only 16%. S3 

showed the largest urban area, representing 11,5% of the watershed, whereas the other 

watersheds had less than 5%.

In the same way, the Manhattan distance revealed that the most forested site (S5) is 

also the most distant watershed according to the LULC pattern, followed by S4, which has the 

watershed predominantly covered by agriculture (Table 1). This analysis also indicated that S1 

and S2 had similar LULC pattern, both classified as forested watershed and with a secondary 

predominance of agriculture. S3 and S6 also presented short distance between them considering 

the LULC pattern. These watersheds had a close percentage of forest, agriculture, and pasture, 

but they differed in the percentage of urban area (Figure 2).

In general, the forested watersheds (S1, S2, and S5) showed better values of water 

quality parameters then the degraded watersheds (S3, S4, and S6) (Table 2). The spatial 

differences in water quality linked to LULC patterns among the watersheds are presented in

Notwithstanding its high value of DO, the S4 presented the poorest water quality 

among all the sites, showing the highest value for all the other parameters (Table 2). Moreover, 

it was also the site with the largest temporal variation, with high values of Sd and CV, followed 

by S3 and S6.  

S3 was the second watershed with the highest values of nutrients (TN and TP) and 

coliforms (TC and FC), whereas S6 was the second one with highest values of NTU, TSS, ISS 

and OSS. In the case of TC and FC, S3 and S4 presented values much higher than the other 

sites.  

On the other hand, S5 showed the best values of water quality parameters, followed 

by S1 and S2, respectively.  

Concerning the DO concentration, the watersheds showed mean values above 6mg.L-

1, but S3 was the only watershed which presented samples below 6mg.L-1 (reaching 4.4 mg.L-

1), and it was also the site with the lowest annual mean, whereas S2 showed the highest value 

(Table 2). 

There was a correlation between NTU, TSS and ISS (Table 3), because those variables 

represent the particles in the water. OSS was also related to those variables, but not with the 

same magnitude.

coliforms. 

 

Another relation was TP with TSS, with an r = 0.57. Moreover, the linear regression 

showed that TSS was the water quality variable more related to streamflow (R2 = 0.21, 



23 

 

p&lt;0.0001) (Figure 4), followed by NTU (R2 = 0.19). Although this relation was significant, it 

is not high, which denotes that streamflow influenced the water quality, but it alone did not 

explain the water quality variation.

basin, São Paulo State, Brazil. 

 

Both groups (forested and degraded watersheds) showed a significant difference in 

water quality according to the multivariate analysis (Hotelling-Lawley´s ? = 0.47; F = 5; P = 

0.0003), as illustrated in Figure 5.  It is possible to see that, besides DO concentration, degraded 

watersheds showed higher values of the water quality parameters than the forested ones, and 

the greatest temporal variation (Figure 5).

phosphorus, TC = total coliforms, and FC = fecal coliforms. 

 

PCA analysis strengthened the relation between degraded watersheds with higher 

values of water quality parameters, except with DO (Figure 6). The first PCA axis explained 

33.3%, where the main variables that drove the separation between forested and degraded 

watersheds were TSS, OSS, TP and FC. Only TN was not correlated with PCA axis 1. The 

second PCA axis represented 31.8% of the data variability, which means a total of 65.1% of 

explanation.

2.4. Discussion 

The LULC patterns indicated that the natural ecosystem, in the study area, was 

replaced by the expansion of production systems as agriculture and livestock (Figure 2), that 

were the primarily responsible for the deforestation of the Atlantic Forest biome (Silva et al., 

2016). The reduction of forest cover affects negatively the water quality, once the most forested 

watershed showed the best water quality among the watersheds as shown in Table 2 and Figure 

3. 

The two watersheds that had the most different LULC pattern from the others (S5 and 

S4) (Table 1) also presented the best and the poorest water quality, respectively (Table 2). It 

indicates that the LULC pattern had a significant role in controlling the water quality. Besides 

it had the lowest values of pollutants, the most forested watershed (S5) also presented the lowest 

temporal variation, whereas the most agricultural watershed (S4) presented the highest values 

of annual average and temporal variation of the water quality parameters (Table 2). 

Great temporal variation in water quality is also an indicative of watershed 

degradation, once during the rainy season, especially in tropical watersheds, the water 

degradation in streams with no forest cover is raised due to the other LULC being more prone 



26 

to direct surface runoff and, consequently, to transfer pollutants into the river. That 

demonstrates how important the Atlantic Forest is for the surface water quality (Pinto et al., 

2013; Huang et al., 2013; Ou et al., 2016). According to Baker and Miller (2013), forest cover 

in a watershed promotes the decrease in runoff and increase in interception and soil infiltration, 

reducing sediment discharge and nutrients and pollutants loading into the river in storm events. 

In this context, our results indicated that NTU and TSS responded to streamflow 

variation (Figure 4) but this relation was not strong, showing that, besides the hydrological 

influence, the LULC pattern had a great impact on water characteristics. Similarly, Carroll et 

al. (2013) and Chea et al. (2016) found that spatial variation (between sites) was greater than 

the temporal variation of water quality. Seasonal variation in precipitation, surface runoff, 

interception, and abstraction have a strong influence on river discharge, and consequently 

variations in water quality (Huang et al., 2016), but these effects are controlled by the LULC 

pattern, once degraded watersheds showed greater temporal variation (Table 2). 

Turbidity and suspended material represent the particles in the water, then it was 

expected that those parameters were correlated, as found by Wang et al. (2013) and 

Wickramaarachchi et al. (2013). Phosphorus outputs, in turn, are dependent on sediment 

(Huang et al., 2016), because it is easily adsorbed on mineral particles (Silva et al., 2009) which 

are represented by the correlation between TP and TSS (Table 3). The S4 presented much higher 

values of those parameters than the other sites, and it can be related to the non-point sources 

pollution from the agriculture lands. The forest cover of 35% in this watershed was not enough 

to control this impact. It was the only stream that reached values close to 100 NTU. 

Great values of NTU lead to the decrease of photosynthesis in the water body, affecting 

the aquatic community, especially in low order streams. The increase of sediment represents an 

increment in nutrients, toxic metals and other pollutants carried by the soil particles (Nasrabadi 

et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2017). Throughout the world, the increase in the sediment load of 

streams is one of the major causes of degradation on water quality from agricultural watersheds 

(Gonzales-Inca et al., 2015; Restrepo et al., 2015; Crabit et al., 2016). 

Phosphorus is usually the most limiting nutrient in freshwater aquatic ecosystems, 

leading to eutrophication when it is in excess of what the organisms can use, which is one of 

the most important causes of water degradation (Huang et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2017). In 

this way, S3 and S4 can face problems due to the high values of TP compared to the other 

watersheds, mostly because of the wastewater from residential areas and runoff from 

agricultural lands (Figure 3), the same found by Ding et al. (2013) and Gonzales-Inca et al. 

(2015) in agricultural watersheds. In the same way, S3 and S4 showed the highest values of TN 



27 

 

(Table 2 and Figure 3), indicating the water degradation from residential areas without sewage 

collection and excess of fertilizer use in agricultural lands (Calijuri et al., 2015; Gallo et al., 

2015; Sharma and Sharma, 2015; Giri and Qiu, 2016). 

Phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizers accumulate in agricultural soils, these surplus 

fertilizers may either remain in soils or be exported into surface waters by erosion or leaching. 

The use of fertilizers and pesticides is common and, in many cases, intense in the Sarapuí River 

basin (Schnaider and Costa, 2013). In the São Paulo State, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium 

consumption are 181.7 kg per hectare/year, which is above the national average (IBGE, 2012). 

According to the Brazil National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA), Brazil represents 

86% of the pesticide and fertilizers consumption in Latin American. Examining some of the 

watersheds studied here, Schnaider and Costa (2013) found that almost all the farmers (96%) 

use pesticides for controlling pests, diseases, and invasive plant species and synthetic fertilizers. 

This uncontrolled use of agrochemicals in these watersheds threat the water quality of the 

Sarapuí river and its tributary, Pirapora river, that together supply four cities in the region. We 

can see that, even still presenting 35% of forest cover, S4 showed the highest levels of nutrients 

in the surface water, which is a result of the agricultural activities in the watershed. 

 The presence of FC in the water indicates contamination with fecal material of 

humans or other animals from the residential and agricultural areas, wherein domestic sewage 

is usually the primary source of FC loading (Reder et al., 2015). Our study area is characterized 

by agricultural land comprised of small farms with isolated houses also without sewage 

collection, where the contaminants from the wastewater are directed discarded on the soil or 

into the river (Costa et al., 2011). Therefore, the residential areas and agricultural lands in S3 

and S4 were responsible for the highest values of FC (Table 2), following the pattern found for 

nutrients. According to the CONAMA Framework Resolution 357/2005 that fixed the 

conditions for establishing water quality categories in Brazilian aquatic systems to human use, 

S3 is classified as Class 2, and S4 as Class 3, which request a more complex water treatment 

than rivers classified as Class 1. 

  Although it does not affect the drinking water quality directly as the other water 

quality parameters here, DO is one of the most important water characteristics for the biological 

integrity of the aquatic environment, and it affects the chemical reactions that occur within the 

water body (Brooks et al., 2003). In this study, almost all the streams maintained good values 

of DO concentration except S3, which reached values above 5 mg.L-1. According to Welch and 

Lindell (2004), warm water (tropic rivers) requires DO levels of at least 5 mg.L-1 to sustain fish 



28 

populations. These low values of DO concentration in the S3 can be related to the eutrophication 

process due to the wastewater coming from the urban area, but also to its low streamflow 

registered during the year, once DO is directly associated with streamflow (Uriarte et al., 2011). 

The human activities, in this case, can be responsible also for the alterations in water yield, 

affecting the mixing processes that contribute to water aeration.     

We highlight that, even presenting agriculture areas, the forested watersheds showed 

better water quality than degraded watersheds, indicating the importance of the forest cover for 

these systems to minimize sediments, nutrients and coliforms loads into the river, as shown by 

the results of Hotelling-Lawley Test (Figure 4), providing drinking water and simplifying the 

water treatment for water supply. On the other hand, the forest cover below 35% in the degraded 

watersheds was not enough to reduce the pollutants as it was for the watersheds predominantly 

forested (55% or more). Ding et al. (2013) pointed out that the water quality in stream 

catchments is severely influenced by the non-point source pollution resulting from farmland 

and residential land in agriculture watersheds, whereas forest can effectively mitigate water 

quality degradation. Knee and Encalada (2014) stated that forested streams consistently have 

the lowest pollutant concentration in a rural tropical forest region similar to our study area. 

Accordingly, degraded watersheds were grouped due to the higher values of TSS, 

OSS, TP and FC (Figure 5), whereas forested watersheds were associated with high values of 

DO, the same pattern found by Huang et al. (2016) using PCA analysis. Thus, mechanisms such 

as better soil management practices in agriculture, forest cover restoration projects, and riparian 

vegetation restoration efforts are some of the essential steps needed to improve water quality in 

agricultural watersheds, decreasing the runoff, sediment losses, and loading rates of nutrients 

and coliforms (Gunawardhana et al., 2016). 

Second, it might also be considered that wastewater from the residential and 

agricultural lands was combined with the pollutants from the croplands, which aggravated the 

water quality deterioration. It is important to control the point source pollution of wastewater 

from these areas. Therefore, parallel to forest restoration plans, there is a needed for the 

implementation of basic sanitation in this region, avoiding the sewage disposal on the soil and 

into the river, which is still a huge problem in tropical areas like South America and Africa 

(UNICEF and WHO, 2015).

2.5. Conclusion 

Watersheds predominantly covered by forest have lower pollutant concentration than 

watersheds primarily covered by other uses. Forest cover has influence in reducing sediment, 

nutrients, and coliforms loads into the river. On the other hand, degraded watersheds, especially 

those covered by agricultural and urban lands, present the highest values of pollutants and the 

greatest temporal variance of water quality parameters, which is also an indicative of human 

impact. 

Besides de LULC impact on water quality, stream flow also contributes to its variation, 

increasing turbidity, sediments and phosphorus in storm events.  

Our findings suggest that the impacts sources on water quality in agricultural 

watersheds mainly come from runoff from croplands and residential wastewater, wherein the 

tropical forest cover plays an important role in minimizing the impacts of human activities on 

watershed ecosystem services. 

Forest restoration, better soil management practices, basic sanitation implementation, 

and point source poluttion control are all needed to improve water quality in tropical agricultural 

watersheds.

3. EFFECTS OF LAND USE/LAND COVER ON WATER QUALITY OF 

LOW-ORDER STREAMS IN SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL: 

WATERSHED VERSUS RIPARIAN ZONE 

Abstract 

Natural habitats conversion into agricultural and urban lands is one of the major factors of 

water quality degradation. Especially in low-order streams, water quality is strongly influenced by 

the land-use/ land-cover (LULC) pattern. However, this relation may be different for various water 

quality parameters at different spatial scales. Here, we evaluated the LULC effects on water quality 

of low-order streams, comparing the watershed and riparian zone influences, to identify the key 

factors determining water quality variability. We collected water samples in low-order streams in 

Brazil to obtain data of nutrients, sediments and fecal coliforms. We also used streamflow, 

precipitation and temperature data. The water quality parameters were analyzed separately and 

together by statistical models and multivariate analysis. We also investigated the influence of the 

seasonal effect. The results indicated that the forest cover plays an important role in keeping water 

clean, while agriculture and urban areas lead the water quality degradation. Pasture had mixed 

effects, but in general was not correlated with poor water quality, once the livestock activities are 

not intensive in the area. Dissolved oxygen, total phosphorus, total suspended solids and fecal 

coliforms responded better to the LULC composition within the watershed, while total nitrogen and 

organic matter were more affected by the landscape composition in the riparian zone. Besides the 

spatial variation, the water quality also varies with seasonal changes, especially with streamflow and 

temperature variability. The overall water quality variation is explained better by the LULC 

composition within the watershed than in the riparian zone. It suggests that the water management 

and forest restoration planning need to adopt a multi-scale perspective, but the actions must be 

directed to the whole watershed, not only to the riparian zone. Although the importance of the 

riparian zone, the watershed management in the low-order streams is extremely necessary for the 

water quality maintenance, aiming at the water resources conservation downstream.

3.1. Introduction 

Natural habitats conversion into anthropogenic landscapes due to the increasing 

human demand for resources is one of the main factors behind the alterations on water quality 

(Giri and Qiu, 2016; Su et al., 2016). Agricultural and urban lands increase has been described 

as one of the greatest contributors to the increment of nutrients and sediments in freshwater 

ecosystems worldwide (Uriarte et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2016). However, non-point sources 

pollution is tough to identify due to the complex and diffuse nature of the interaction between 

hydrologic and landscape patterns (Chiwa et al., 2012). Also, the relationship between land 

use/land cover (LULC) and water quality can occur at different spatial scales, from local to 

regional effects (Wang et al., 2013; Tanaka et al., 2016). 



38 

Low-order streams (1st to 3rd order) dominate the riverine landscape and they 

maintain the function, health, and biodiversity of entire river networks (Vannote et al., 1980; 

Wipfli et al.; 2007). According to Vannote et al. (1980), they are strongly influenced by 

terrestrial inputs, which makes them fragile ecosystems, which can suffer dramatic impact from 

land-use changes. 

The relationship between LULC and water quality in low-order streams, despite its 

importance for the watershed, it is not well documented (Ding et al., 2016). It is crucial to 

understand those interactions in low-order streams once they are responsible for the water, 

organic matter, sediments and nutrients transportation downstream (Gomi, 2002). 

In this way, the riparian zones can play an important role in maintaining water quality, 

once they represent the aquatic-terrestrial ecotone. Riparian zones exert important influences 

on the waterways by mediating the bi-directional flow of matter and energy between the water 

body and the surrounding hinterland (Hanser et al., 2010). For example, the riparian forest can 

reduce nitrates, phosphorus, and sediment loading into the river (Krutz et al., 2005; Oliveira et 

al., 2010; Batson et al., 2012; Saalfeld et al., 2012; Gonzales-Inca et al., 2015; Ou et al., 2016) 

and it can also influence the energy balance (Tanaka et al., 2016). Replacing riparian forest by 

other land-cover types leads to a decrease in water quality due to the bank erosion, consequently 

increasing nutrient and sediment loads into the river (Ding et al., 2013, Ou et al., 2016; Yang 

et al., 2016). 

Some studies have shown that LULC is a better predictor of water quality in the 

riparian zone than within the watershed (Tran et al., 2010; Shen et al., 2015), while others have 

found that the LULC patterns at the watershed scale better account for the variability in river 

water quality (Zhou et al., 2012; Ding et al., 2016). Uriarte et al. (2011) and Tanaka et al. (2016) 

also mentioned that the water quality indicators had presented different response for LULC 

patterns, when they were evaluated at different spatial scales. Consequently, authors have 

highlighted the importance of the multiscale analysis, specially, aiming at the understanding of 

the impacts of LULC on water quality (Uriarte et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2012; Tanaka et al., 

2016). 

In this context, this study aimed at to evaluate the land-use/land-cover (LULC) effects 

on water quality of low-order streams, comparing the watershed and the riparian zone 

influences. The specific objectives were: (1) to identify the key factors that influence the water 

quality variability; (2) to evaluate the relationship between LULC patterns and water quality 

within the whole watershed and in the riparian zone; (3) to identify which LULC pattern has 

the strongest influence on water quality in low-order streams.

3.2. Material and Methods 

3.2.1.  Study area 

The study area is the Sarapuí River basin located in the São Paulo State, southeastern 

Brazil (Figure 1). The Sarapuí River is a tributary of Tiete River, and it supplies four cities in 

the State, providing water for domestic, agricultural and other purposes.  

Most of the soil types in the Sarapuí River basin are red or yellow tropical soils, mainly 

Latosols, and low-activity clays predominate (Oliveira et al., 1999; Coelho et al., 2003). The 

watershed was originally covered by Atlantic Forest, with Dense Ombrophilous Forest as the 

predominant forest type, which has been replaced by agriculture, pasture, eucalyptus and urban 

areas. Agriculture is the backbone of the economy, especially the production of grains, fruits 

and vegetables. 

The region is under the influence of Cwa climate (humid temperate with dry winters), 

with the annual precipitation between 1354.7 mm and 1807.7 mm (CEPAGRI, 2014), and the 

rain mostly falling from October to March. 

Six 3rd-order streams (numbered S1 to S6) were selected with similar area, shape, 

average-slope and soil types, but with different LULC patterns.

3.2.2.  Conceptual approach 

The conceptual approach for this study includes the LULC types within the watershed 

and riparian zone, water quality data, streamflow and, water temperature data. All data were 

used to build statistical models for each water quality parameter and a multivariate analysis 

integrating all the water quality parameters (Figure 2). 

 

Figure 2. Conceptual approach used in this study. 

 

3.2.3. Watershed and riparian zone delineation 

Map manipulations and spatial analysis were performed using the Geographical 

Information System (GIS) ArcGIS 10.2. 

River network and a 5m-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from 

official topographic information (IGC, 1:10,000 scale) were used to delimit the watersheds. We 

employed the standard tools for hydrology and watershed, which are available in the GIS to 

delineate the six 3rd-order watersheds, basing on the sampling sites and the watershed areas 

upstream. 

We adopted the Permanent Preservation Area (PPA), according to the Brazilian Forest 

Code (Brasil, 2012), as riparian zone. Therefore, we established a 30m buffer along the river 

networks, and a 50m buffer around springs. 



41 

 

3.2.4.  Land-use/land-cover maps 

The watershed LULC maps were obtained by on-screen digitizing (1:8,000 scale) of 

SPOT images (2.5m-spatial resolution; panchromatic band, year: 2010), that were supplied by 

the Environment Secretariat of the São Paulo State, Environmental Planning Coordination 

(SMA-CPLA). 

The follow LULC classes were pre-defined, basing on the technical manual on land 

use of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE, 2013): water, wetlands, forest, 

eucalyptus, agriculture, pasture and urban. 

In this study, agriculture represents the fast-growing vegetables (short cycle crops), 

e.g. onion, potato, pumpkin, strawberry, and lettuces. Urban represents the residential areas, 

once there are no large cities or industrial areas in the study area. Pasture comprises grassland 

destined to livestock activity, even without cattle in the studied period. Forest represents the 

areas covered by native forest (Atlantic Forest). 

The map accuracy and the agreement were measured through the confusion matrix and 

the kappa coefficient (Congalton and Green, 1998), based on 121 ground control points 

distributed along the six watersheds. We obtained 105 overall hits, which represent 87% of 

agreement, and a kappa coefficient of 0.83, indicating a very good accuracy of the LULC map 

(Rosner, 2006). 

The LULC eucalyptus, water, and wetlands were not used in the models, due their low 

incidence in the watersheds. 

3.2.5. Water sampling and measurement 

 The following water quality indicators were chosen to represent impacts 

produced by anthropogenic activities: dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen (TN), total 

phosphorus (TP), total suspended solids (TSS), organic suspended solids (OSS), and fecal 

coliforms (FC). The samples were collected at bi-weekly intervals from October 2013 to 

October 2014 for the six watersheds, when we also measured the temperature (T) and 

streamflow (Q). 

DO and T were measured through an in-situ water quality detector (YSI 556 

multiparameter system). Water samples were collected in duplicate to determine TN, TP, TSS 

and OSS, which were kept refrigerated and transported to the laboratory for advanced analysis, 

following standard methods (APHA, 2005). TN was determined by Kjeldahl digestion method, 

TP by spectrophotometry, and TSS and OSS by using gravimetric analysis (APHA, 2005). FC 



42 

were detected by the multiple-tube technique (CETESB, 1993), and the results are given in 

Most Probable Number (MPN). 

 Q was measured using the current-meter method, which divides the stream 

channel cross section into numerous vertical subsections (Santos et al., 2001). In each 

subsection, the area was obtained by measuring the width and depth, and the water velocity was 

determined using a current meter (Global Water Flow Probe – 201). The total discharge was 

computed by summing the discharge of each subsection.  

 The daily precipitation data for the study period were obtained from our own 

Weather Station (Davis Vantage Pro2) close to the Itupararanga Reservoir. 

3.2.6. Data analysis 

The variables were checked for normality and transformed, when it was necessary, 

using logarithm forms. We applied Pearson´s correlation to determine the strength and 

directions of the relationships between LULC patterns and the individual water quality 

parameters. 

A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) using the Hotelling-Lawley Trace 

was used to check differences between rainy (October – March) and dry season (April – 

September). 

After this preliminary analysis, we performed separate generalized linear mixed 

models (Zuur et al., 2009), to obtain the optimal equation for each water quality parameter 

through the lme4 package of the statistical software R (R Development Core Team, 2014). 

Firstly, we performed, for the riparian zone and watersheds, a full model for each water quality 

parameter, including the water quality parameters as dependent variables and, as predictors, the 

percentage of forest, pasture, agriculture and urban cover types. Based on previous findings, 

models also included Q as predictor and T as covariate to include the season effect (McDowell 

and Asbury 1994; Uriarte et al., 2011). Watershed and time (monthly) were used as random 

components. We also tested a 3-day and a 7-day precipitation period prior to each water quality 

sampling, in order to predict streamflow. 

The Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) were 

used for model selection (Akaike, 1998). The backwards stepwise removal of predictors was 

employed to assess which individual predictors were important drivers for each water quality 

parameters. The final models were selected based on the lowest value of AIC and BIC, but only 

predictors with significance level of 0.05 were considered. 



43 

 

A Pearson’s correlation between the LULC types was used to avoid variables strongly 

correlated. The forest cover was not included as predictor in the final model because it was 

strongly negatively correlated with the other LULC types. 

We calculated model goodness of fit as the proportion of explained variance (R2) using 

the method described by Xu (2003), that computes the residual variance of the full model 

against the residual variance of a fixed intercept-only null model. 

The redundancy analysis (RDA), which is an extension of multiple regression to model 

multivariate response data (Zuur et al., 2007), was applied to evaluate the global descriptions 

about the influences of LULC pattern on water quality, considering the watershed and riparian 

zone. The RDA is a form of constrained ordination that examines how much of the variation in 

the set of independent variables explains the variation in the set of dependent variables. This 

analysis allowed us to simultaneously examine the influences of the LULC types on all of the 

water quality parameters. For this analysis, the logarithm transformation was applied for the 

annual average of each water quality parameter. A Monte Carlo permutation test (999 

permutations) was used to determine the statistical validity of the RDA. We used the RDA 

function in the vegan package of the statistical software R. 

All the statistical analyses were performed using the software RStudio (RStudio Team, 

2014).  

3.3. Results 

3.3.1.  Land use/land cover composition 

The proportion of forest cover at the watershed scale was greater than land uses in S1, 

S2, and S5, wherein the last one showed the greatest forest cover (75%), followed by S2 (57%) 

and S1 (55%) (Figure 3 and Table 1). 

Conversely, S4, S6 and S3 presented, respectively, 35%, 29%, and 25% of forest cover 

in the watershed. Likewise, S4 had the largest agricultural area (54%), followed by S6 (33%), 

S3 (29%), S1 (27%) and S2 (23%), while the S5 had only 16%. S6 and S3 presented the highest 

values of pastureland (32% and 28%), S1 and S2 showed similar values of pasture cover 

(between 11% and 12%), while S4 and S5 had only 3%. S3 showed the largest urban area, 

representing 11,5% of the watershed.

State, Brazil. 

 

Considering the LULC in the riparian zone, S1, S2 and S5 showed forest cover greater 

than 70%, while S3 showed the lowest value (39%), followed by S6 (45%) and S4 (56%) (Table 

1). S1 and S2 showed the lowest value of agriculture in the riparian zone (between 6% and 8%). 

S4 showed the highest value for agricultural lands (26%) and S3 for urban areas (10%), the 

same pattern from the LULC within the entire watershed.

An important characteristic of the study area are the agricultural lands, which are 

comprised by small farms, having families living, in many cases, in the property (Ribeiro et al., 

2011). Consequently, the agriculture class revealed isolated houses (Figure 4). The predominant 

fast growing vegetables found in the study area were onion, potato, pumpkin, cucumber, leek, 

strawberry, artichoke, and lettuce.

3.3.2.  Impacts of land use/land cover on water quality 

Water quality parameters were correlated with LULC patterns in accordance with the 

results of Pearson’s correlation (Table 2), and mixed models (Table 3). 

Forest cover was the main land cover associated with good water quality, while urban 

and agricultural lands were related to water quality degradation, considering both, watershed 

and riparian zone. After forest cover, the next LULC type that showed the lowest impact on 

water quality was pasture. 

The proportion of forest cover was positively correlated with DO and negatively 

correlated with solids (TSS and OSS), TP, TN and FC within the watershed and riparian zone. 

Although, the correlation between forest and DO was strongest at the riparian zone. Conversely, 

urban area was negatively correlated with DO and positively with the other parameters. 

Agriculture was positively correlated with solids, TP, TN and FC, but also with DO at the 

watershed scale.

There was a difference between rainy and dry seasons in the water quality (Hotelling-

Lawley´s ? = 0,26; F = 2,85; P = 0.015), due to the changes in precipitation, temperature, and 

streamflow. 

Streamflow varied with precipitation, and the 3-day precipitation period prior to each 

water sampling had better value than the 7-day (R2 = 0.61 and 0.58, respectively). Almost all 

the models for water quality included streamflow as predictor (Table 3), showing that water 

quality parameters varied with changes in water discharge. This variable showed a better 

prediction than previous precipitation in the models. Temperature was also a predictor for DO 

and TN for both the watershed and for the riparian zone models.

The models explained 49% to 72% of the observed variance in water quality 

parameters (Table 3). Those parameters showed different responses related to both the whole 

watershed and the riparian zone. In the case of DO, TSS, TP and FC, they ca be explained by 

the proportion of LULC at the whole watershed. On the other hand, models that considered 

LULC in the riparian zone were better predictors of in-stream concentration of TN and OSS.

The DO concentration showed the lowest value in the watershed with the highest 

percentage of urban area (S3). Concerning the other LULC types, the proportion of forest 

increases the DO concentration, while it decreases with pasture. The watershed model also 

considered agriculture as a predictor of increase of DO. This water quality parameter responded 

better to the composition of LULC in the whole watershed than the riparian zone. As expected, 

DO concentrations increased with streamflow and decreased with temperature (Table 3). 

Similarly, the parameters TSS, TP, and FC also showed better response for the LULC 

composition in the whole watershed, wherein agriculture was the most important predictor of 

the increase of those variables, followed by urbanization. Inversely, forest cover represented 

decrease of them. Not surprisingly, TSS increased with streamflow, as well as TP. However, 

streamflow did not represent relation with FC variation. 

The LULC in the riparian zone were better predictors of TN and OSS concentrations. 

Urban areas in the riparian zone were the most important LULC type for the increase in TN, 

and agriculture was also important for the input of OSS. We can also highlight two results, that 

watersheds covered by forest presented lower levels of TN than the others, and that TN and 



48 

OSS showed negative relation with pasture. In the case of TN concentration, it decreases with 

the increase of temperature, but decreases with rise in streamflow. 

The RDA results showed that, considering all the water quality parameters 

simultaneously, the variation was better explained by LULC composition within the whole 

watershed than by the riparian zone configuration (Figure 5). The first canonical axis (Figure 

5) explained the most of the water quality variation. In this scenario, the RDA model explained 

82% of the variation for the whole watershed and 75% for the riparian zone composition. 

Considering the LULC in the watershed, the first axis separated sites with the highest 

percentage of agriculture and urban lands (S3 and S4) from those with the highest forest cover 

(S5, S1 and S2) (Figure 5.A). This first axis consistently displayed a water degradation gradient, 

where sediments, nutrients and fecal coliforms were negatively correlated with forest cover and 

they were also positively correlated with urban and agricultural lands. It is possible to note that 

S5, which has the highest forest cover than the other sites, was associated with the best water 

quality. On the other hand, S3 and S4, which have the highest percentages of urban and 

agriculture areas, respectively, were associated with poor water quality. Although it has not an 

extensive forest cover, S6 did not show the same pattern as S3 and S4. This watershed presents 

the highest percentage of pasture between the sites.

3.4. Discussion  



49 

 

The LULC maps indicated that some watersheds are predominantly covered by 

agriculture and pasturelands due to the agricultural occupation process that occurred in this 

region (Schneider and Costa, 2013). The S4 is an example with more than 50% of the watershed 

covered by agriculture. Vettorazzi and Valente (2016) also observed that watersheds which 

suffered an increase in agricultural areas had a drastic reduction of forest cover. This fact is not 

suitable for the water quality conservation, once the reduction of forest cover and the increase 

in agricultural activities lead to a rise in sediments and nutrients loading into the river (Table 

2). 

Conversely, the studied sites presented their riparian zone with a higher percentage of 

forest than the whole watershed, reflecting the efforts of conservation of riparian zones, and 

also the difficulty in expanding agricultural activities over those areas due to the steep relief or 

predominance of wetlands (Mello et al., 2014). 

The forest cover, both for watershed and for riparian zone, was related to good water 

quality, and it plays a major role in keeping water clean in different watersheds in the world 

(FAO, 2008; Wang et al., 2013; Oliveira et al., 2016). Precisely, because sediments, nutrients, 

and fecal coliforms were positively related to the agricultural and urban uses and negatively to 

forest cover. Studies have shown that agriculture and urban areas represent the most important 

LULC that induce the water quality degradation (Zhou et al., 2012; Ding et al., 2016; Huang et 

al., 2016; Ou et al., 2016). In the agricultural lands, excessive fertilizers, runoff and soil erosion 

led to the increase in sediment, nutrients, chemical contaminants, and organic matter into the 

water body (Poudel, 2016). In urban areas, the increase of wastewater and pollutants accumulate 

on the impervious surfaces resulting in the water deterioration (Lee et al., 2009; Ding et al. 

2016), and although small in percent coverage, it exerts a disproportionately large influence on 

water quality (Zhou et al. 2012), 

In our study, urban use is composed of residential areas and agriculture comprises 

small farms, and they represent the most important vectors of water degradation, as found by 

Ding et al. (2013) and Gunawardhana et al. (2016). On the other hand, forest cover behaves as 

a filter, controlling and decreasing the sediment and pollutants, that are carried in surface runoff 

(Ding et al., 2013), also increasing DO concentration (Table 2 and Figure 5). 

Unlike other studies that showed negative impacts of the pasture on water quality 

(Uriarte et al., 2011; Tanaka et al., 2016; Ou et al., 2016), our results did not associate this land 

use with water degradation for most of the water quality parameters. Pasture only had an 

adverse impact on DO. Ding et al. (2013) and Wang et al. (2013) also found a positive 



50 

correlation between water quality and grassland, which means that both forest and grassland 

can effectively mitigate water quality degradation (Wang et al., 2013; Ding et al., 2013; Ding 

et al., 2016). It is important to note that our study area do not have large cattle ranches, and 

many of those areas are abandoned pasture lands. In this way, adverse impacts from the 

presence of the animals on the water quality may not occur in the same magnitude as found by 

other studies. According to Latawiec (2015), the low-productivity pasturelands with few cattle 

are a great opportunity for forest restoration in the tropical agricultural landscapes. The increase 

in pasture productivity could provide new areas of land for restored forest. 

Besides the spatial variation in water quality, we also observed a temporal variation 

linked to the seasonal changes. According to Huang et al. (2016), seasonal variations in 

precipitation surface runoff, interception, and abstraction have a strong influence on river 

discharge and, consequently, variations in sediment and nutrient concentrations are a seasonal 

phenomenon. Oliveira et al. (2016) highlighted that in regions with a well-defined rainy season, 

like many parts of Brazil, the non-point pollution sources usually have a reduced effect on the 

stream water quality due to the decrease in runoff during the dry season. Thereat, the addition 

of temporal and hydrological data was essential to determine the effect of the landscape pattern 

on water quality in the region. 

The percentages of forest, agriculture and urban lands were the most important LULC 

that explain the spatial variations of water quality parameters (Table 3), wherein urbanization 

and agriculture were the main predictors of the increase of water quality parameters. Recent 

studies also showed a reduction of independent variables of the models with LULC class mainly 

because of the existing collinearity between the LULC classes (Gonzales-Inca et al., 2015; Li 

et al., 2015; Oliveira et al., 2016). According to Oliveira et al. (2016), this approach allows to 

easily identify the main classes responsible for the variations in water quality. 

Our results showed that DO concentration responded better to LULC within the 

watershed than in the riparian zone, and the forested watersheds have the highest values for 

DO, alike found by Uriarte et al. (2011) and Ding et al. (2016). However, the correlation 

analysis showed that the riparian forest had an important role in increasing DO concentration, 

which is greater than we had considered for the forest in the whole watershed. According to 

Abell and Allan (2001), forested streams have cooler water and higher oxygen concentration 

levels. DO concentration was negatively correlated with temperature, once the DO demand 

increases with the increase in temperature, while the oxygen solubility in the water decreases 

(Manahan, 2004). Thus, the negative impact of pasture on DO can be connected to the fact that 

these lands led to an increase of water temperature. The discharge of organic matter into the 



51 

 

water body from urban areas also leads to low DO concentrations, especially in areas that do 

not have sewage collection and treatment (Calijuri et al., 2015). On the other hand, increasing 

streamflow raises the water oxygenation, which can occur in agricultural areas (Uriarte et al., 

2011; Wang et al., 2013). 

The results also indicated that TP and TSS were strongly explained by the LULC 

composition in the watershed and weakly in the riparian zone, and it was the same pattern found 

by Uriarte et al. (2011) and Ding et al. (2016). We can highlight, in this context, that agriculture 

represented the main source of sediments and phosphorus, followed by urban land. The 

suspended solids reflect the intense agricultural activity, where the farmers do not implement 

conservation practices, which leaves the soil constantly exposed and subject to erosion, as so 

found by Calijuri et al. (2015). Also, the hill slopes in the study area can enhance the huge soil 

erosion from the exposed soil, as pointed by Sharma and Sharma (2015) on watersheds covered 

by shifting cultivation. 

The parameters TP and TSS also increased with stream discharge. In rain events, the 

soil erosion is potentiated, and sediments with nutrients are transported into the river (Poudel, 

2016). In this way, this study highlighted that the agricultural practices in fast-growing 

vegetable crops need to adopt strategies to minimize soil erosion and runoff. 

FC were also better explained by the percentage of agriculture and urban area in the 

watershed, what is common in the literature, specially linked to human activities and animal 

waste (Meays et al., 2004). However, in our study, they were much more correlated to 

agriculture than with urbanization and, it can be related with the fact that agriculture represents, 

in the sites, higher percentage of the landscape than urban areas (Ou et al., 2016). In addition, 

the agricultural lands in the study area are comprised of small farms with isolated houses 

without sewage collection (Costa et al., 2011). The sewage is often discharged directly into the 

watercourse, on the soil or in a cesspit without structure to avoid soil and groundwater 

contamination, called “black cesspit”, a common problem in rural areas in Brazil (Pinto et al., 

2012). It brings the importance of the basic sanitation services in rural areas, and the biodigester 

has been an alternative in some agricultural watersheds in Brazil (Costa and Guilhoto, 2014). 

Contrary to the other water quality parameters, TN and OSS were stronger correlated 

with the LULC composition in the riparian zone than in the watershed (Table 3), where 

agriculture and urban areas were responsible for the in-stream nitrogen and organic matter, and 

forest cover represents decrease in these parameters. Sewage from domestic and food 

processing sources contains a wide variety of pollutants, including organic pollutants 



52 

(Manahan, 2004). In the same way, Gonzales-Inca et al. (2015) found that riparian vegetation 

is important explaining nitrate concentrations due to its potential of nutrient pollution mitigation 

in agricultural watersheds. The nitrogen cycle is complex, and it depends on many factors 

within the aquatic, terrestrial and aerial environment (Manahan, 2004). This chemical element 

is in constant transformation and it is used by many organisms in the waterbody and in the 

riparian ecosystem (microorganisms and plants) (Wetzel, 1993; Brooks et al., 2003). Due to 

these characteristics, it is understandable that our riparian zone model presented better results 

than the model for the watershed. OSS represents the organic matter in the water, and it is also 

strongly linked to the riparian composition and its interaction with the aquatic ecosystem 

(Wetzel, 1993). 

As expected, NT concentration in the water decreases with the increase in temperature, 

because the microorganisms’ activities in the water and soil are affected by temperature (Mello 

et al., 1983; Wetzel, 1993). However, in contrast to other studies that showed a positive relation 

between streamflow and nitrogen (Uriarte et al., 2011), our study showed a negative relation. 

The dilution effect played an important role for the sampling sites located in small watersheds, 

which means abundant discharge reduced the concentration of TN, as it was so pointed by Wang 

et al. (2013). According to Dellagiustina (2000) and Gallo et al. (2015), the agricultural 

activities may be not enough to overcome the dilution effect of the precipitation events. Gallo 

et al. (2015) also pointed out that these sites are more sensitive to shifts in hydrologic 

partitioning in response to land-cover change than those associated with climate change. 

Concerning the RDA results, we ascertained that the LULC pattern at watershed was 

better than at riparian zone when it was related to the overall water quality variation as found 

by Ding et al. (2016) and Gonzales-Inca et al. (2015) for low-order streams. However, the 

mixed models showed that different parameters of water quality varied in their responsiveness 

to the different scales when analyzed separately, as reported elsewhere (Uriarte et al., 2011; 

Zhou et al., 2012). This multiplicity point of view suggests that the water management and 

forest restoration planning need to adopt a multi-scale perspective, but the actions must be 

directed to the whole watershed. Although the confirmed importance of the riparian zone, our 

study demonstrates that the watershed management in low-order streams is extremely necessary 

for the water quality maintenance. 

It is important to note that our study considered a 30m-riparian buffer along rivers and 

50m-spring buffer as riparian zone (PPA) following the Brazilian law. Ou et al. (2016), studying 

the influence of the buffer zone width on water quality, highlighted that the 50m-riparian zone 

accounts for a low proportion of the whole watershed area, which weakens at this scale the 



53 

 

influence of landscape features on river conditions. The authors found that the 100m-riparian 

zone had the largest effect on river water quality. It brings the question about the effectiveness 

of the 30m-buffer for the water sources conservation. In our study, the forest conservation and 

the anthropic activities at the watershed scale in general had greater importance for the water 

quality maintenance than the 30m-riparian zone. The studies which reported that the LULC 

pattern in the riparian zone plays greater importance than the LULC within the watershed used 

different buffer widths. For example, Tran et al. (2010) considered 200m of riparian zone along 

the rivers in USA, while Shen et al. (2015) considered a buffer zone of 100m in China. 

Ding et al. (2016) highlight that opposite results in studies regarding the LULC impact 

on water quality might be because different methods adopted to delineate the local buffer zone, 

differences in regional settings and water quality parameters. Ou et al. (2016) also linked these 

differences to the sampling strategy and data resolution. The higher or lower resolution of the 

land-use data may miss some crucial landscape features of the land-use composition and 

configuration. In our study, we considered seasonal variation, and we used high-resolution 

spatial data, which can differ from studies that only considered rainy season or used low-

resolution data. Other differential in our work is that the agricultural land was comprised by 

small farms, with isolated houses, without sewage collection, which was strongly connected to 

water quality degradation. 

Nevertheless, our findings highlight the forest cover as a key landscape feature to 

prevent deterioration of water quality. Additionally, we found that grassland (pasture with few 

cattle or abandoned pasture) does not lead to water degradation as agriculture and urbanization, 

and it could be a good opportunity for forest restoration plans. This information can help 

managers to establish best alternatives for the water quality improvement in the headwater 

streams. We showed that the environmental planning must consider the whole watershed to 

design public policies aiming at the water resources conservation, not only the riparian zone, 

although the riparian forest restoration can be prioritized as a short-term action aiming at the 

water quality improvement (Vettorazzi and Valente, 2016). 

According to Rodrigues et al. (2011), better agricultural and cattle production practices 

can provide new areas for restoration actions in rural watersheds. Low-order streams, often 

located on steeper slopes, are more sensitive to nonpoint source pollutants loading than flat 

areas in the watershed (Yang et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2016). Then, the environmental planning 

of these areas is crucial to ensure water with high quality downstream. 

 



54 

3.5. Conclusion 

We conclude, based in our results, that forest cover is the most important LULC type 

to maintain the water quality in the low-order streams, and agriculture and urban areas are 

responsible for the water quality degradation. 

Sewage from residential areas, sediments and nutrients loading from the short-cycle 

crops lead to the nonpoint pollution into the small rivers. Grassland has mixed impact on water 

quality, and in general does not lead to water quality degradation, once they represent low-

productivity or abandoned pasturelands. 

Besides the spatial variation, water quality also varies with seasonal changes, 

especially with streamflow and temperature variability. Thus, streamflow and temperature are 

also important predictors to explain some of the water quality parameters variation. 

The water quality parameters have different responses regarding the landscape 

composition within the watershed and the riparian zone. However, the overall water quality 

variation is better explained by LULC composition at watershed scale than at riparian zone. It 

suggests that the water management and forest restoration planning need to adopt a multi-scale 

perspective, but the actions must be directed to the watershed management. Although the 

importance of the riparian zone, our study demonstrates that the watershed management in low-

order streams is extremely necessary for the water quality maintenance aiming at the water 

resources conservation downstream. Nevertheless, the riparian restoration can be prioritized as 

a short-term action aiming at the water quality improvement.

4. RIPARIAN RESTORATION FOR PROTECTING WATER QUALITY 

IN TROPICAL AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS 

Abstract  

Land-use change in riparian zones is one of the most significant threats to water quality in 

stream ecosystems. Riparian forests play an important role in protecting water quality, and there is 

a need to assess the role of riparian restoration in reducing nutrients and sediment loading. This 

study uses watershed simulation modeling to evaluate impacts of riparian forest restoration on water 

quality in agricultural watersheds. Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to simulate 

streamflow, suspended sediment and nutrients of the Sarapuí River basin, southeastern Brazil. We 

found a spatial and temporal variation in water quality impacts resulting fro m variation in land use/ 

land cover (LULC) and rainfall patterns. Subbasins with agricultural and residential lands showed a 

higher sediment and nutrients loads than others covered by forest and pasture, and this relation is 

strongest during the rainy season. Riparian restoration reduced suspended sediment (by 9.26%), total 

nitrogen (22.6%) and total phosphorus (7.83%). However, forest conservation in the whole 

watershed cannot be substituted by protecting only the riparian zone preservation, as forested 

subbasins showed better water quality than those covered by other LULC types. The results show 

the importance of restoration plans in the riparian zone, providing a scientific understanding of the 

role of riparian forest for the water quality improvement by reducing nutrients and sediments loading 

into the river.

4.1. Introduction  

The riparian zone is the interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and can 

provide many ecosystem functions, as well as playing an important role on nutrients and 

sediments transfer (Kuglerová et al., 2014; Ou et al., 2016). Although the riparian forest can 

contribute to the water quality protection, it is one of the most degraded ecosystems in the world 

(Nilsson and Berggren, 2000; Kuglerova et al., 2014). Replacing riparian forest by other land 

uses decreases water quality due to bank erosion, increasing nutrient and sediment loads into 

the river (Ding et al., 2013, Ou et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016a). Therefore, land use change in 

riparian zones is one of the most significant threats to water quality in stream ecosystems, 

bringing the importance of understanding the benefits from their restoration (Zhang et al., 2013; 

Yang et al., 2016b). 

Riparian forest cover can play a major role in the biogeochemical cycles in watersheds. 

The vegetation provides protection against erosion, retention of pollutants, excessive nutrients 

runoff and increased water temperature (Sopper, 1975; Sweeney et al., 2004; Lima and Zakia, 

2006; Mingoti and Vettorazzi, 2011; Schilling and Jacobson, 2014; Tanaka et al., 2016) and 

benefits both the quality of human life and survival of aquatic species (Saalfeld et al., 2012; 



62 

Ding et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2016a; Tanaka et al., 2016). Especially in the currently context 

in that agriculture and urban growth have been appointed as the primary cause of water quality 

degradation (Uriarte et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2016). 

Riparian buffers have been pointed as effective in reducing nutrients and sediment 

loading into streams (Uusi-Kämppä and Jauhiainen 2010; Gonzales-Inca et al., 2015; Monteiro 

et al. 2016; Ding et al., 2016). Cho et al. (2010) observed that intact riparian forest reduced 20.5 

% of sediment load in a watershed in USA. In this context, the proximity to surface water has 

been used as a criterion for prioritizing areas for forest restoration in watersheds (Vettorazzi 

and Valente, 2016). However, the effectiveness of the riparian buffers depends on the 

hydrogeological condition, and it is influenced by numerous factors and varies from local to 

regional scales (Wang et al., 2013; Gonzales-Inca et al., 2015). 

Land use impacts on water quantity and quality are assessed using hydrological models 

in urban and agricultural watersheds (Wangpimool et al., 2013; Pereira et al., 2014; Lin et al., 

2015; Wagner et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). Lin et al. (2015) assessed the hydrologic and 

water quality impacts of agricultural land changes in North America. Nejadhashemi et al. 

(2012) used models to evaluate land use change impacts in agricultural watersheds in Midwest. 

Studies have also reported the impacts of riparian land use on water quality worldwide 

using hydrological models. Gitau et al. (2006) used a model in evaluating a combination of best 

management practices that include riparian buffers in reducing phosphorus loads. Moriasi et al. 

(2011) used a hydrological model to quantify the effect of riparian forest buffer and Bermuda 

grass filter strip on sediment yield in a reservoir in USA. Yang et al. (2016b) examined the 

water quality effects of riparian wetland losses and restoration in Canada.  

However, the impacts of riparian restoration in tropical river basins are not well 

documented. Monterio et al. (2016) observed that riparian restoration to comply with Brazilian 

Forest Code could reduce sediment load by 29.4% in a catchment in the Brazilian Cerrado. The 

Atlantic Forest, in particular, is a biodiversity hotspot (Mittermeier et al., 2011) highly 

threatened since it has been reduced to only 11% of its original cover (Ribeiro et al., 2009). Its 

reduction has affected the water quality and, consequently, water supply (Strassburg et al. 

2016). 

There is a need to understand the importance of tropical forest cover to water quality 

and how the riparian forest restoration can contribute to the water sources conservation. Here, 

we use a watershed hydrological model to simulate the effects of riparian zone restoration on 

water quality in tropical agricultural watersheds. It presents a comparative evaluation of 

watershed-wide and riparian zone forest restoration on water quality for policy considerations. 



63 

 

This is important in using riparian zone management within the broader context of watershed 

systems. The specific objectives were: (1) to model hydrological processes for streamflow and 

water quality in watershed system; (2) to evaluate the impacts of agricultural and residential 

lands on sediment and nutrient loadings; (3) to assess the importance of the tropical forest cover 

on water quality; and (4) to simulate a riparian zone restoration scenario and its impacts on 

agricultural watershed system. 

4.2. Material and Methods 

4.2.1. Study Area 

The study area is the Sarapuí River basin (1,550 km2), located in the São Paulo State 

(between the coordinates UTM 23S 195,000 m and 265,000 m; 7,360,000 m and 7,420,000 m), 

southeastern Brazil (Figure 1). 

 

Figure 1. Land use/land cover of Sarapuí River basin and the six experimental watersheds, Brazil. 

 

The main rivers of the basin flow from east to west. The drainage network is 

particularly dense in the eastern portion of the basin, where the highest elevations can be found. 

The density of the drainage network decreases in the central and west part. Most of the soil 

types in the Sarapuí River basin are red or yellow tropical soils, mainly Latosols, and low-

activity clays predominate. However, other soil types also occur in the basin, as Gleysols and 

young soils like Regosols and Fluvisols. Gleysols occur more on the central and west portion 

of the basin. The region is under the influence of Cwa climate (humid temperate with dry 



64 

winters). Annual precipitation is between 1355 mm and 1808 mm (CEPAGRI, 2014), and the 

rain mostly falls from October through March. Between December and February are the 

maximum precipitations (around 200 mm monthly) (CEPAGRI, 2014). Temperatures range 

from 5°C to 32°C, with an annual average of 20°C. January and February are the hottest months 

(monthly temperature average of 24°C), and June and July are the coldest months (monthly 

temperature average of 16°C). 

Sarapuí River is a tributary of Tiete River, one of the main rivers in Brazil. Tiete river 

showed the lowest values of the national water quality index in 2014 (SMA, 2014). Sarapuí 

River basin is a particular case of an agricultural watershed close to very high-density urban 

regions like Sorocaba and Sao Paulo. Sarapuí River supplies four cities in the São Paulo State, 

and its proximity to those regions represent trends for agricultural and urban sprawl due to the 

demands from the big cities. It was originally covered by Atlantic Forest, which has been 

replaced by agriculture, pasture, eucalyptus and residential (urban) areas. Pasture and 

agriculture lands represent, together, 53% of the basin. Agriculture is characterized by the 

production of grains, fruits, and vegetables. Despite the agricultural activities, the basin still 

presents 37% of forest cover. 

We selected six 3rd-order streams (numbered S1 to S6) (Figure 1) within the Sarapuí 

River basin to be our experimental watersheds and to establish the sampling sites, where we 

collected water samples during 2013 and 2014 for comparing with simulated data. We selected 

watersheds with similar physical characteristics: area, shape, average slope and soil types, but 

with different LULC patterns: three forested watersheds (more than 55% of forest cover) and 

three degraded (less than 35%). S5 has 75% of forest cover followed by sites 1 and 2 (both with 

60% of forest cover). S3 presents only 25% of forest cover, 30% of agriculture and the largest 

residential area (12%). S4 has the largest agricultural area (54%) and 35% of forest cover. S6 

is 29% covered by forest, 32% by agriculture and 32% by pasture. 

4.2.2. Conceptual Model 

The conceptual framework for the Sarapuí River Basin Model consists of a system 

including the watershed hydro-physical characteristics, land use/management and conservation 

actions (riparian restoration), with water quality as the effect (Figure 2). We used slope, 

hydrology, climate, soil and LULC information to calibrate a hydrological model for the 

Sarapuí River basin to assess the water quality characteristics and their relation to LULC 

pattern. Then, we created a new LULC map simulating a 100% riparian restoration. The new 

scenario was used in the model to simulate water quality responses of riparian forest restoration.

4.2.3. SWAT Model Development 

Models have long been used in water resources management to guide decision-making 

and improve understanding of the watershed system. Hydrological and water quality data can 

be modeled at different spatial and temporal scales. Integration between water quality mon-

itoring and modeling has been suggested to understand surface water quality better and to make 

appropriate and effective decisions for nonpoint source pollution control (Davenport et al., 

2008). Models calibration enables to simulate alternative scenarios and evaluate the dynamics 

of the watershed (Pessoa et al., 1997). 

SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model was used to model streamflow, 

sediment yield (total suspended solids) and nutrients load (total nitrogen and total phosphorus). 

SWAT is a non-point source pollution model developed by Dr. Jeff Arnold for the USDA 

Agricultural Research Service (ARS) (Neitsch et al., 2011). SWAT was developed to predict 

the impact of land management practices on water, sediment and chemical yields in watersheds 

with varying soils, land use and management conditions over long periods of time (Neitsch et 

al., 2011). It is a continuous-time, semi-distributed, process-based river basin model (Arnold et 

al., 2012). Simulation of the hydrology of a watershed in the model is separated into two major 

divisions: land phase, that controls the amount of water, sediment, nutrient and pesticide 

loadings to the main channel; and routing phase, defined as the movement of water and the 



66 

other components through the channel network of the watershed to the outlet (Neitsch et al., 

2011). It has been applied to understand the sediment losses and nutrient loadings in the 

watershed around the world (Marshall and Randhir, 2008; Reungsang et al., 2009; Wilson and 

Weng, 2011; Poudel et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2015). 

The SWAT model divides a basin into subbasins connected by stream networks. Each 

subbasin is further divided into hydrologic response units (HRUs) that are unique combinations 

of different LULC types, soils, and surface slopes. Within each subbasin, the areas with similar 

LULC, soil types, and surface slopes are lumped together into a single HRU. The model 

requires several data, which encompasses LULC map, soil map, elevation map, precipitation, 

temperature, humidity, streamflow, and water quality input. Those data are necessary for model 

calibration and validation, the two steps for developing a hydrological model. 

In this study, the Sarapuí River basin was divided into 178 subbasins, including our 

six experimental watersheds. Each experimental watershed was represented by a subbasin in 

the model. 

The model was set to define multiple HRUs with a 2% threshold level for each 

subbasin – that is, any LULC or soil type that covered 2% or more of the subbasin was defined 

as an HRU. 

4.2.3.1. Data 

The inputs for the SWAT model of the Sarapuí River basin are derived from different 

sources, and they were reprojected in UTM SIRGAS 2000. 

We used a 30-m Digital Elevation Map (DEM) from the Environmental Planning 

Coordination of the São Paulo State (CPLA, 2013). SWAT model produces a slope map using 

the DEM. For the slope classes, we used the Brazilian classification from Embrapa (1999). We 

used the stream network data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE, 

2015) (1:50,000 scale). The LULC map was extracted from our own thematic map (1:50,000 

scale) obtained by on-screen digitizing of a Landsat TM-5 scene from 2010 (Figure 1). We used 

our own map of soil types, produced by sensor data and soil samples collected in 2014. The soil 

types found in the Sarapuí River basin are Gleysol, Yellow Latosol, Red-yellow Latosol, 

Regosol, Fluvisol, and Cambisol. The soil properties like number of layers, depth of the lower 

boundary of each surface layer, bulk density, available water capacity, saturated hydraulic 

conductivity and percentage of soil particles were collected from the Agronomic Institute of 

Campinas (IAC) (Oliveira, 1999) and specialized literature (Juhasz et al., 2006; IBGE, 2007; 

Gomes and Pereira, 2009). The hydrological classification followed Sartori et al. (2005) for 



67 

 

Brazilian soils. We use an equation proposed by Baumer (1990) for albedo, and for soil 

erodibility factor (USLE – K) an equation proposed by Williams (1995). 

Daily weather information was collected from four official stations, provided by the 

National Meteorological Institute (INMET): São Paulo – Mirante do Santana, São Miguel 

Arcanjo, Sorocaba, and Iguape. We used the following weather information: solar radiation 

(MJ/m2/day), wind speed, maximum and minimum air temperature (°C) and relative humidity. 

The other parameters are derived from those data, using the equations presented on SWAT 2012 

manual (Winchell et al., 2013). 

Precipitation data for the 1955-2014 period was obtained from five gauge stations from 

the National Water Agency (ANA, 2015): São Miguel Arcanjo, Tatuí – Sarapuí, Piedade, 

Sorocaba and São Paulo – Mirante do Santana. Streamflow, suspended solids and nutrients data 

were collected from ANA at two gauge stations: Sarapuí River and Pirapora River (Figure 1), 

and from our own data of the experimental watersheds. Daily loads of suspended solids and 

nutrients were estimated using the product of the daily streamflow volume and the 

instantaneous water quality measurements. 

4.2.3.2. Model Calibration and validation and sensitivity analysis 

The calibration and sensitivity analysis were performed by optimization methods using 

the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting algorithm (SUFI-2) (Abbaspour, 2011) in the SWAT-CUP 

software (Abbaspour, 2015). We calibrated the model starting with streamflow, followed by 

sediment and then nutrients as suggested for calibration procedure (Abbaspour, 2011). The 

streamflow calibration is a first step necessary to obtain the water quality parameters. 

Streamflow was calibrated and validated against daily, monthly and yearly 

streamflow, for a period of 33 years (1980-2012), with three years as a warm up period. The 

streamflow data from the Sarapuí River gauge were used for observed values for calibration. 

Streamflow data from the Pirapora river gauge were used for validation. Sediment and nutrients 

were calibrated for the period of seven years (2004-2010) for the Sarapuí River basin and 

validated using the six experimental watershed data. 

We parameterized the model following suggestions in SWAT manual (Winchell et al., 

2013) for three levels: basin, subbasin and HRU levels. We also used parameters identified in 

the literature that has the potential to influence on streamflow, sediment yield and nutrients 

loading (Arnold et al., 2012; Andrade et al., 2013; Kushwaha and Jain, 2013; Abbaspour et al., 

2015; Fukunaga et al., 2015). 



68 

Numerical and graphical performance criteria were used to evaluate model 

performance during calibration and validation. The numerical performance criteria include 

coefficient of determination (R2) (Coffey et al., 2004), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NS) (Nash 

and Sutcliffe, 1970) and percent bias (PBIAS) (Gupta et al., 1999), as shown in Equations 1 to 

3:

where Q is a variable (e.g., discharge), and m and s stand for measured and simulated, 

respectively. Percent bias measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or 

smaller than the observations. The optimum value is zero, where low magnitude values indicate 

good simulations. Positive values indicate model underestimation and negative values indicate 

model overestimation (Gupta et al., 1999). 

We conducted sensitivity analysis to check which input or calibration parameters have 

the strongest influence on the model results. A t?test was used to identify the relative 

significance of each parameter. The sensitivities are estimates of the average changes in the 

objective function resulting from changes in each parameter, while all other parameters are 

changing. This gives relative sensitivities based on linear approximations and, hence, only 

provides partial information about the sensitivity of the objective function to model parameters. 

In this analysis, the larger, in absolute value, the value of t?stat, and the smaller the p?value, the 

more sensitive is the parameter (Abbaspour, 2011). 

 

4.2.4. Land-use/land-cover patterns and water quality 

After calibrated, the model was applied to evaluate the impact of LULC patterns 

(agriculture, residential areas, and forest) on water quality for the Sarapuí River basin in a 

current scenario. We compared subbasins with different LULC types and their water quality

responses. Forested subbasins were compared to agricultural ones regarding sediment and 

nutrients loading. 

The spatial distribution of annual (30-year average) values for water quality attributes 

was mapped for each subbasin. The values of each water quality parameter were reclassified 

by natural breaks (Jenks) method into three categories to represent low, medium and high levels. 

4.2.5. Riparian forest restoration impacts on water quality 

We simulated the riparian forest restoration impacts on the water quality for the 

Sarapuí River basin. We considered Riparian Zone the Permanent Preservation Area (PPA), 

according to the Brazilian forest code (law 12651 of 2012). The law sets a buffer of 30m from 

the river banks and 50m around the springs. FAO recommendation for water quality protection 

is also 30m, as well as proposed by Welsch (1991). We created a riparian-scenario besides the 

current scenario to simulate the PPA restoration, adding forest cover in all the PPA buffer in 

the current LULC map. The PPA buffer was created from the stream network using ArcGIS 

(ESRI). The new LULC map was added to the calibrated model to run the riparian-scenario 

results. 

We simulated the impact of the riparian forest restoration on total suspended solids 

(TSS), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Annual and average loads during 1983-

2014 were calculated under the current and riparian scenarios.

The observed and simulated streamflow for Sarapuí River basin are presented in Figure 

3. It was calibrated daily, monthly and yearly, and the comparisons for the observed and the 

simulated streamflow are shown in Figure 3. The model performance statistics were better for 

monthly calibration (Table 2), as reported by Lin et al. (2015) in the USA and Schmalz et al. 

(2015) in China. 

The streamflow showed an R2 greater than 0.6 for calibration and validation process 

(Table 2), with a value of 0.85 and 0.79 for monthly calibration and validation, respectively. 

Schmalz et al. (2015) obtained close values of R2 for calibration (0.88) and validation (0.85).  

We obtained an acceptable value of NS (&gt;0.36) considering daily (0.65) and yearly 

(0.71) calibration and a value equal to 0.81 for monthly calibration, which is seen as good 

according to the classification proposed by Liew et al. (2007). Lin et al. (2015) obtained close 

values of NS for monthly calibration (between 0.75 and 0.82). At validation process, the NS 

kept an acceptable value, with an NS equal to 0.58 for monthly streamflow average. Pereira et 

al. (2014), also studying a river basin in Southern Brazil, found an NS value of 0.65 and 0.70 

for calibration and validation period, respectively. Glavan et al. (2011) also found better results 

for the calibration (0.62) than for validation (0.47). 

PBIAS presented a good value for calibration (&lt;15%) and satisfactory for validation 

(&lt;25%). Similar results were found by Fukunaga et al. (2015) modeling streamflow in a 

watershed in the Espírito Santo State, Brazil, who obtained better results for calibration (NS = 

0.75, PBIAS = 11%) than for validation (NS = 0.67, PBIAS = 22%).  

According to Liew et al. (2007), when NS is lower than 0.36 and PBIAS is higher than 

25%, the model is considered unsatisfactory. Thus, our model was considered able to predict 

streamflow of the Sarapuí River Watershed.

The comparison between observed and simulated sediment and nutrients is presented 

in Figure 4. Sediment and nutrients calibration showed acceptable value for NS and PBIAS. We 

obtained an R2 of 0.68, 0.54 and 0.62 for TSS, TN, and TP, respectively. Considering NS 

coefficient, TSS showed a value of 0.65 while TN and TP showed values of 0.47 and 0.46. For 

PBIAS, we obtained values of 6.85, 0.18 and 24.45 for TSS, TN, and TP, respectively. Yang et 

al. (2016a) in China, obtained NS values &gt; 0.55 and R2 &gt; 0.7 for TN and TP calibration. In 

another way, Ferrant et al. (2011) found that SWAT model performed poorly in simulating 

nitrogen loads, with an NS coefficient of 0.15.

phosphorus (TP) (C) for the Sarapuí River Basin Model, Brazil. 

 

In our study, the values for sediment and nutrients calibration were lower than those 

for streamflow, which is expected according to Abbaspour et al. (2015), but it is important to 

consider that the lack of data, especially in Brazil, can contribute with the difficult to calibrate 

water quality parameters (Bressiani et al., 2015). Another point to be considered is the fact that 

the model did not consider the contributions of point source pollution, that exist in the Sarapuí 

river basin. Abbaspour et al. (2015) pointed that the model uncertainties can be related to 

processes occurring in the watershed, but not include in the program or processes that are 



74 

included in the program, but their occurrences in the watershed are unknown to the modeler or 

unaccountable because of data limitation. 

4.3.2. Land-use/land-cover patterns and water quality 

The results showed that the highest levels of sediment and nutrients occur in the upper 

half of the Sarapuí River basin (Figure 5), the region that presents the steepest slopes and many 

of the agricultural lands (Figure 1). Despite being at hillslope, some of the subbasins in the 

Upper Sarapuí basin showed low values of sediment and nutrients. Those subbasins presented 

a high percentage of forest cover. It is the case of sites 1, 2 and 5. S5 showed the lowest value 

for sediment and nutrients (in the samples collected in 2013 and 2014), and the sites 3 and 4 

presented the highest value between the six experimental watersheds. The simulated data 

showed the same pattern, with sites 3 and 4 presenting the highest level of sediments and 

nutrients. 

Subbasins covered by agriculture and residential areas in this study showed higher 

levels of sediment and nutrients than subbasins covered by forest and pasture (Figure 5). 

Forested subbasins showed the best values for water quality parameters. Studies show that 

urban and agricultural lands lead to a decreased in water quality (Ometo et al., 2000; Gergel et 

al., 2002; Uriarte et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2012; Erol and Randhir, 2013; Huang et al., 2016). 

Lin et al. (2015) used a SWAT Model to access the impact of bioenergy policies on the water-

quality in the USA. The results showed that an increase of planting areas for corn and soybean 

over forest and pasture losses increases sediment and nutrient loading.  

In our study, watersheds covered by forest followed by those covered by pasture 

showed better water quality than the watersheds with agriculture and residential areas. In the 

same way, Wang et al. (2013) found that forest and farmland cover types play a significant role 

in determining the surface water quality. 

 



75 

 

 

Figure 5. Spatial distribution of water quality attributes for the Sarapuí River basin, Brazil. 

 

Besides the spatial variation, we also observed a temporal variation of water quality. 

Rainy season showed higher nutrients and sediments levels than the dry season for the Sarapuí 

River basin. The same pattern was observed by other studies (Uriarte et al., 2011; Gonzales-

Inca et al., 2015; Ou et al., 2016). Surface runoff wash away the pollutants and soil into the 



76 

river during the rainy season, carrying out sediments and nutrients (Hasan et al., 2015). 

Gonzales-Inca et al. (2015) pointed out that the relationship between agricultural use and 

nutrient losses is strongest during high flow periods. Our model showed the highest sediment 

and nutrients loading between October and March (Figure 4), the rainy season in the region. 

The agricultural areas in the watersheds worked as sources of sediment and nutrients in the 

rainy season. 

We observe the relationship between streamflow, sediment, and nutrients especially 

when we analyze the phosphorus dynamics. A significant relationship was found between TP 

and TSS following the variation on streamflow. This relationship demonstrates a high 

explanatory power (92%). Randhir and Tswetkova (2009) also observed a similar relationship, 

with an explanatory power of 83%. Our results from experimental conditions at the six 

experimental watersheds showed a similar relationship, with an explanatory power of 57% for 

a data collection of one year. Urban and agricultural development frequently increase nitrogen 

concentrations in streamflow and result in the greatest problems of phosphorus loading to water 

bodies. Those nutrients are transported by sediment, especially in rainfall events. Transported 

sediment from watersheds composed of different land uses can carry high levels of nutrients. 

Sediment transport of phosphorus can reduce the chemical quality of surface water and result 

in substantial changes in aquatic ecosystems (Brooks et al., 2003). Sediment loading represents 

the major problem for water quality in other tropical rivers (Hasan et al., 2015). 

4.3.3. Riparian forest restoration impacts on water quality 

Forest cover in the Sarapuí River basin has increased by 14% after riparian forest 

restoration (Table 3). Pasture and agriculture have decreased by 8% and 10%, respectively.

Figure 6 shows the annual and average loads under the current and riparian scenarios. 

The general trend is that the sediment and nutrients loads were greater under the riparian 

scenario than in the current scenario. TSS average reduced by 9.26%, TN by 22.6% and TP by 

7.89%. Studies show that riparian forest helps to reduce nitrogen, nitrate, phosphorus, pesticide 

and sediment (Krutz et al., 2005; Oliveira et al., 2010; Batson et al., 2012; Saalfeld et al., 2012; 

Randhir e Ekness, 2013; Ding et al., 2013, Ou et al., 2016). Simulating the wetland restoration 

at the riparian zone, Yang et al. (2016b) found a decrease of 35% of sediment, 28% of TN and 

37% of TP. Monteiro et al. (2016) found a sediment reduction of 29.4% by simulating the 

riparian restoration according to the Brazilian law in a catchment in the Cerrado. 

These results show that the riparian restoration could be an efficient alternative to 

improve water quality against water treatment processes and wastewater treatment projects. The 

costs associated with water and wastewater projects are enormous and in many cases, they are 

not considered to be implemented in rural areas in Brazil. According to Honey-Rosés et al. 

(2013), the riparian forest restoration could generate economic savings for water treatment 

managers in the range of €57,000-€156,000 per year in a river in Spain.

Figure 6. Annual and annual average loads of (A) total suspended solids (sediment yield), (B) total nitrogen (TN) 

and (C) total phosphorus (TP) under two different scenarios in the Sarapuí River basin, Brazil. 

 

According to Hanser et al. (2010), riparian zones play an important role in mediating 

the bi-directional flow of matter and energy between the water body and the surrounding land. 

Forest cover at the riparian corridor can influence stream nutrient concentrations, physical 

characteristics and energy balance (Tanaka et al., 2016). Ou et al. (2016) found that the first 

100 m of the riparian zone has the largest effect on river water quality. FAO recommendation 

for water quality protection is 30 m, as well as proposed by Welsch (1991) and used in our 

study. In Victoria, Australia, the minimum width recommendations for riparian zones were 

established for different levels of land use intensities (Hanser et al., 2010). For low intensity, 

the recommendation to improve water quality is 30m and for high-intensity land use, the 

recommendation is 60m.  

This is an interesting discussion because the role of the Riparian Zone can be different 

for different land use intensities. In our study, we followed the Brazilian Forest Code that 

establishes a 30m riparian zone protection that does not consider the landscape around. 

According to Monteiro et al. (2016), the reduction of the 30-m buffer to 5-m riparian corridor 



79 

 

only, as currently discussed in the São Paulo State, reduces the potential of the riparian zone in 

reducing sediment into the river. 

It is recognized that there will always be competing social and economic issues that 

will ultimately influence decisions about riparian zone (Hanser et al., 2010). However, the 

scientific understanding of riparian zone as it relates to ecological function is important to guide 

the decision making. In this way, our results provide a scientific understanding of the role of 

riparian forest for the water quality improvement by reducing nutrients and sediments loading 

into the river. Future restoration plans must incorporate riparian zone as priorities areas in order 

to mitigate water quality problems, once our results showed that the riparian forest restoration 

can reduce sediment and nutrients loads into the river by 8 to 23%, respectively. 

Especially in tropical regions, the natural regeneration can improve the provision of 

ecosystem services including water purification (Stranssburg et al., 2016; Chazdon and Uriarte, 

2016). Considering that many degraded areas in the tropics are composed by low-productivity 

or abandoned pasturelands, those areas are a great opportunity for forest restoration in the 

tropical agricultural landscapes (Latawiec et al., 2015). According to Strassburg et al. (2016) 

the natural regeneration of abandoned pasturelands would reduce the costs of purifying the 

water. In the Sarapuí River watershed, pasture is the second predominant land use, representing 

28.4% of the watershed. Better cattle ranching techniques could create new areas for forest 

restoration in this area. 

In this way, riparian restoration can be a good alternative to improve water quality in 

tropical watersheds where land use is predominantly for agricultural activities, but it cannot 

replace forest conservation plans for the entire watershed, once forested watersheds showed 

better water quality than those covered by other LULC types in this study. Our results further 

demonstrate the importance of stopping forest degradation and the establishment of forest 

restoration plans by prioritization of riparian restoration to improve water quality. It is important 

to consider sustainable agricultural practices combined with forest conservation plans to 

provide current and future water supply. 

 

4.4. Conclusions 

We propose a modeling approach to evaluate the impacts of riparian forest restoration 

on water quality in agricultural watersheds in Brazil using a watershed simulation model 

(SWAT). 



80 

The Sarapuí River Basin Model is satisfactory to simulate streamflow and water 

quality parameters. Water quality has a spatial and temporal variation correlated to LULC 

patterns and precipitation events. There is a high correlation between sediment and phosphorus 

loading following streamflow variation. Sediment and nutrients increase in high streamflow 

periods. Forested subbasins show better water quality than subbasins covered by anthropogenic 

uses. Subbasins covered by agricultural and residential lands have a high contribution to 

sediment and nutrients loading into the river and this relation is strongest in the rainy season. 

The riparian restoration, with the increase of forest cover and a decrease of agriculture and 

pasture, contributes to the decrease of sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus loading. 

Future conservation plans in agricultural watersheds can use our results to locate areas 

for restoration in order to improve water quality. Riparian restoration can be a good alternative 

to improve water quality in watersheds where land use is predominantly related to agricultural 

activities, but a forest conservation plan for the entire watershed cannot be discarded. The 

management practices must have a watershed perspective not only a local focus on properties 

or towns. Future management plans and environment policies should consider the landscape 

planning at the whole watershed, indicating the riparian restoration as the first step to water 

quality improvement, especially in regions where available areas for forest restoration are 

scarce. 

The model provides satisfactory results for water parameters simulation and enables 

to create future scenarios, but the lack of available data can be a challenge to apply it in some 

regions. Future studies about land-use change and the impacts on water quality must be 

conducted in tropical regions where agricultural activities are in expansion. The contribuition 

of the point source pollution must be considered in future studies about watershed management. 

Riparian zone shows a high importance for water quality, and different vegetation types, the 

degree of forest conservation and buffer width can be tested for riparian restoration in future 

researches.

5. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS 

Throughout the chapters, this study has showed the importance of forest cover 

maintenance to the water conservation, in tropical agricultural watersheds, once it provides 

sediment, nutrients and other pollutants retention to the water bodies, whereas agricultural and 

urban lands are the major land uses responsible for water quality degradation. 

 The soil constantly exposed, present in short cycle crops, as in our study area, 

are heavily subject to erosion, increasing runoff in storm episodes, especially in the rainy season 

in tropical areas. The sediment from these areas carries nutrients and other pollutants into the 

river, mainly total phosphorus (TP), which is easily adsorbed by the soil particles. Thus, the 

land-use impacts on water quality are controlled by the hydrologic conditions and, in this study, 

the watersheds that presented the greatest agricultural area showed the highest pollutant 

concentrations and the greatest temporal variation because of this process. On the other hand, 

even with agricultural areas, watersheds with high percentage of forest cover present better 

water quality than watersheds mostly covered by other land uses, which demonstrates that forest 

cover contributes to minimizing the negative impacts from the agricultural activities. 

The urban areas, represented in this study by small residential areas scattered within 

the agricultural lands or by small neighborhoods of the town, which do not have sewage 

collection, have a strong influence on the river water quality despite their low percentage in the 

landscape, regarding the production of organic matter (organic suspended solids – OSS), 

nutrients (TP and TN), and fecal coliforms (FC) and decreasing dissolved oxygen (DO) 

concentrations. Besides, the isolated houses present in the agricultural areas also seem to lea d 

water quality degradation, especially in the FC production. 

In contrast to agriculture and urban areas, in our study area, where the livestock 

activities are not intensive, pasture (or abandoned pasture) does not generate water quality 

degradation, in general, showing that the grassland cover contributes to minimizing runoff and, 

consequently, the pollutants loading into the river. However, forested areas have a higher 

potential of pollutant retention. 

The water quality parameters have different responses regarding the landscape 

composition within the watershed and the riparian zone, which requires a multi-scale 

perspective of the decision-makers regarding the water resources management. Nonetheless, 

the land-use and land-cover pattern within the watershed exerts greater influence on water 

quality than considering only the riparian zone, which emphasizes the importance of the 



92 

watershed management in an effort to order the land use and occupation guaranteeing the 

ecosystem services provision in keeping water clean. 

Nevertheless, the riparian restoration can reduce by up 23% the sediment and nutrients 

loading into the river, which shows off the advantage in keeping the forest cover along the 

buffer zone surrounding the rivers. Therefore, the riparian restoration can be prioritized as a 

short-term action aiming at the water quality improvement, especially in watersheds mostly 

covered by agriculture and in regions where available areas for forest restoration are scarce. 

However, to ensure water with good quality downstream, proper management need to be 

implemented on the low-order streams. 

Forest restoration and conservation plans, better soil management practices from 

agricultural activities and sewage collection need to be adopted for the entire watershed aiming 

at the water quality improvement. In this regard, this study can contribute to planning future 

actions and policies design of forest and water resources management and conservation. It can 

also contribute to future studies on water management strategies and negative impacts of 

deforestation and forest degradation.   

The crescent demand for drinking water requires strategies of long-term water quality 

maintenance, which involves a holistic view of the ecosystem, and the understanding of the 

processes in the watershed that are a mix of natural and anthropic factors. The balance between 

environmental conservation and economic expansion is needed to the sustainability of human 

activities and the other species survival that inhabit the same planet. To achieve this goal, 

science and policy need to walk side by side, and researches like the present study are important 

to bring science closer to critical environmental, social and economic issues that we are 

currently facing.
