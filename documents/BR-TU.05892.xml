ABSTRACT 

 

SANTOS, Taciana Ferreira, M.Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, February, 2018. 
Genetic structure of the population of Pseudocercospora ulei in the watershed of 
the Amazon river. Adviser: Eduardo Seiti Gomide Mizubuti. 

 

South American leaf blight (SALB) is a destructive disease caused by the fungus 

Pseudocercospora ulei that can severely affect rubber tree in monoculture in tropical 

America. The causal agent of the disease is a hemibiotrophic pathogen, that grows 

slowly under in vitro conditions. Isolation of good quality DNA in proper quantities is 

not an easy task due to the difficulties in the handling of P. ulei under laboratory 

conditions and the lack of a standard protocol. Although SALB has been known for 

nearly a century, information on the genetic structure of P. ulei in the Amazon region, 

its center of origin, remains unknown. In this work, adequate protocols for DNA 

extraction were assessed and the population genetic structure of P. ulei in the Amazon 

region was determined using 12 microsatellite loci (SSR). Six extraction protocols were 

compared regarding yield and purity of the DNA. A total of 61 isolates were sampled 

along the Madeira, Purus and Juruá watersheds located in the Amazon region and SSR 

genotyped. The Doyle and Doyle DNA extraction protocol was the one that presented 

consistent and better quality extracted DNA. There was linkage disequilibrium 

between alleles and genetic differentiation between geographically distant populations 

was detected. Principal component analysis revealed clustering of the isolates 

according to the watershed boundaries. Two groups were formed, one comprised by 

individuals from the Madeira river and the other comprised of individuals from the 

Purus and Juruá rivers.

RESUMO 

 
SANTOS, Taciana Ferreira, M.Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, fevereiro de 
2018. Estrutura genética da população de Pseudocercospora ulei nas bacias 
hidrográficas do rio Amazonas. Orientador: Eduardo Seiti Gomide Mizubuti. 

 

O mal das folhas da seringueira (MDF) é uma doença destrutiva causada pelo fungo 

Pseudocercospora ulei que pode afetar severamente a seringueira em monocultura na 

América tropical. O agente causal da doença é um patógeno hemibiotrófico que 

apresenta crescimento lento in vitro. O isolamento de DNA de boa qualidade em 

quantidades adequadas não é uma tarefa fácil devido à falta de um protocolo padrão e 

a dificuldade de cultivar P. ulei em condições de laboratório. Embora o MDF seja 

conhecido por mais de um século, informações sobre a estrutura genética na região 

amazônica, seu centro de origem, permanecem desconhecidas. Neste trabalho foram 

avaliados protocolos adequados para a extração de DNA e a estrutura genética da 

população de P. ulei na região amazônica. Foram comparados seis protocolos de 

extração em relação a pureza e ao rendimento do DNA. Um total de 61 isolados foram 

amostrados ao longo das bacias hidrográficas Madeira, Purus e Juruá localizadas na 

região amazônica e genotipados para 12 locos SSR. O protocolo de extração de DNA 

de Doyle e Doyle foi o único que apresentou concentração consistente e melhor 

qualidade do DNA extraído. Houve desequilíbrio de ligação entre os alelos e 

diferenciação genética entre populações geograficamente distantes foi detectada. A 

análise de componentes principais revelou agrupamento dos isolados de acordo com 

os limites das bacias hidrográficas. Foram formados dois grupos, um constituído pelos 

indivíduos da bacia do rio Madeira e o outro composto por indivíduos dos rios Purus 

e Juruá.

Introdução geral 

 

A seringueira (Hevea brasiliensis) é a principal fonte de borracha natural 

utilizada nos setores médico/farmacêutico, construção civil, calçados, móveis, 

autopeças, maquinário industrial e agrícola (Pereira et al., 2000; Bega, 2004; van 

Beilen e Poirier, 2007). Apesar da composição química da borracha sintética 

assemelhar-se à da borracha natural, suas propriedades físicas são inferiores e 

impossibilitam seu uso na produção de vários produtos, como por exemplo, a 

fabricação de pneus para aviões, automóveis, caminhões e ônibus (Mera, 1977; Santos 

e Mothé, 2007). Dentre os fatores físico-químicos que fazem da borracha natural um 

produto insubstituível para diversas aplicações, estão a elasticidade, resiliência, 

resistência à ruptura, isolamento e impermeabilidade a líquidos e gases (Lieberei, 

2007; Mooney, 2009). 

Os maiores produtores mundiais de borracha natural são a Tailândia, Indonésia 

e Malásia, países localizados no sudeste asiático (FAO, 2018). Ásia e África são 

continentes livres do fungo Pseudocercospora ulei, agente etiológico do mal das folhas 

da seringueira, também chamada de SALB (South American leaf blight), a principal 

doença de H. brasiliensis. Existe uma preocupação de pesquisadores com relação à 

possível introdução dessa doença em plantações da África e, principalmente, da Ásia 

(van Beilen e Poirier, 2007), uma vez que este continente é responsável por 

aproximadamente 90% da produção mundial de borracha natural (FAO, 2018) e a 

maioria dos clones cultivados é considerada suscetível ao SALB (Le Guen et al., 

2002). Na América Latina, o fungo devastou cultivos de seringueira estabelecidos no 

estado do Pará, Brasil, no século XX (Dean, 1987), contribuindo para que o país 

passasse de exportador para importador. Embora o Brasil ainda apresente uma extensa 

área para a instalação de seringais e condições edafoclimáticas altamente favoráveis 

(Gasparotto et al., 1997), a presença de P. ulei em todas as regiões produtoras 

(Gasparotto et al., 1997; 2012) é um dos fatores responsáveis pelo baixo 

desenvolvimento da heveicultura no país. Além de diminuir a produção do látex, o mal 

das folhas pode levar a planta à morte quando ocorrem infecções sucessivas 

(Gasparotto et al., 1989). 

O agente causal de SALB pertence ao filo Ascomycota, classe Ascomycetes, 

ordem Capnodiales e família Mycosphaerellaceae (Hora Júnior et al., 2014). É um 

fungo hemibiotrófico que provoca doença apenas nas plantas do gênero Hevea

(Junqueira et al., 1986). O cultivo deste patógeno in vitro é difícil e, ao longo dos anos, 

diversos autores têm tentado melhorar metodologias para o crescimento em condições 

de laboratório (Chee, 1978; Lieberei et al., 1983; Junqueira et al., 1984; 1985; 1986; 

Mattos, 1999). A melhor estratégia para a obtenção do patógeno é o isolamento 

realizado de forma direta, a partir da transferência de conídios presentes em lesões 

foliares recentes, devido a curta viabilidade dos esporos (Junqueira et al., 1984; 

Gasparotto et al., 1997). Em meio de cultura batata-sacarose-ágar (BSA), a germinação 

do conídio se inicia após 3h de incubação a 24°C, seguido da rápida emissão do tubo 

germinativo e crescimento das hifas primárias após 24h (Junqueira et al., 1984). 

Entretanto, o patógeno apresenta crescimento lento em diversos meios de cultura 

(Chee, 1978; Lieberei et al., 1983; Junqueira et al., 1984; 1985; 1986; Mattos, 1999) e 

comumente observa-se apenas a formação de um micélio incipiente com a produção 

predominante de tecido estromático negro após dois meses (Junqueira et al., 1984). 

Fungos que produzem estruturas de coloração escura normalmente produzem 

melanina, que são compostos associados à patogênese e sobrevivência (Kwon-Chung 

e Rhodes, 1986). No entanto, durante a extração de ácido nucléico, esses compostos 

constituem um desafio para o isolamento de DNA de boa qualidade e em quantidade 

adequada (Isla-Flores et al., 2006). A obtenção de DNA puro é o primeiro passo para 

a realização de estudos baseados em PCR (Reação em Cadeia da Polimerase) (Costa e 

Moura, 2001), dentre os quais está a utilização de marcadores moleculares para a 

genotipagem de patógenos biotróficos ou que crescem lentamente (Milgroom, 2015). 

Existem diversos marcadores genéticos baseados em PCR, os que são loco não 

específico e os loco-específico, como os microssatélites. Estes marcadores são 

sequências simples repetidas em tandem de até seis nucleotídeos em tamanho, 

localizados ao longo do genoma dos organismos (Milgroom et al., 2015). Em virtude 

do seu alto polimorfismo e seletividade neutra têm sido muito utilizados para estudos 

de genética de populações (Ellegren, 2004; Schlotterer, 2004). A genética de 

populações compreende questões referentes aos processos evolutivos e demográficos 

inferidos a partir da estrutura populacional, que consiste no padrão de diversidade 

genética dentro e entre populações (Milgroom, 2015). É preciso conhecer a estrutura 

genética e os mecanismos que determinam a quantidade e distribuição da variabilidade 

genética na população de fitopatógenos para entender o desenvolvimento da doença, 

prever a sua evolução e estabelecer estratégias para o melhoramento visando à 

resistência e à durabilidade dos clones resistentes selecionados (Milgroom e Fry,

1997). Trabalhos sobre a variabilidade de P. ulei foram recentemente conduzidos (Le 

Guen et al., 2004; Barrès et al., 2012; Hora Júnior, 2012), mas até o momento não 

existem estudos sobre a genética molecular de populações do patógeno no seu provável 

centro de origem, a região amazônica. Assim, os objetivos do presente trabalho foram: 

i. Identificar um protocolo adequado para a extração de DNA de P. ulei e, ii. 

Determinar a estrutura genética populacional de P. ulei nas bacias hidrográficas do rio 

Amazonas.

Abstract 

 

In vitro cultivation and maintenance of Pseudocercospora ulei has limited research 

about South American leaf blight, a highly destructive fungal disease of rubber tree. 

The slow vegetative growth of the fungus associated with the predominant stromal 

formation constitutes a challenge for the extraction of DNA of good quality and in 

adequate quantity required for different purposes. Thus, the objective of the present 

work was to assess methods for the extraction of P. ulei DNA. Six methods of DNA 

extraction were compared: 1. High quality DNA extraction; 2. High quality DNA 

extraction plus melanin removal; 3. Modified high quality DNA extraction; 4. Doyle 

and Doyle protocol; 5. Modified Doyle and Doyle protocol plus melanin removal and 

6. Modified Doyle and Doyle protocol. The concentration of the DNA obtained was 

measured using fluorescence-based technology, the quality estimated by 260/280 and 

260/230 ratios using spectrophotometer and the integrity verified by agarose gel 

electrophoresis. Additionally, the DNA was amplified with the ITS1 and ITS4 primers. 

There was variation among the protocols tested, but all yielded good amounts of DNA. 

Protocol 4 was consistently adequate when comparing concentration and quality, in 

both runs of the experiment. Thus, the original Doyle and Doyle (1990) protocol can be 

used for extraction of P. ulei DNA. 

 

Key words: South American leaf blight, Microcyclus ulei, CTAB, method,

Introduction 

 

South American leaf blight (SALB) is the most destructive disease of rubber 

tree (Hevea brasiliensis) in humid areas of South and Central Americas (Lieberei, 

2007). The disease is caused by the fungus Pseudocercospora ulei, which infects 

young leaves inducing repeated defoliation, dieback of the canopy, and death of 

susceptible clones under favorable environmental condition (Holliday, 1970; Chee and 

Holliday, 1986; Lieberei, 2007; Gasparotto et al, 2012). 

The pathogen can form distinct structures when developing on rubber tree 

plants (Chee and Holiday, 1986). When deposited in new leaflets, the ascospores absorb 

moisture, germinate, form the germ tube and produce appresoria, from which the 

infecting hyphae develop. The pathogen penetrates host tissue directly, colonizing the 

foliar tissue intercellularly through the parenchyma (Liberei, 2007) and after five or 

six days, leaflets can have lesions with poorly developed stroma covered by conidia 

(asexual reproduction). One to five months after infection, ascospores are produced 

inside pseudothecia immersed in well developed black stroma on the surface of the 

remaining leaflets (sexual reproduction) (Gasparotto et al., 2012; Hora Júnior et al., 

2014). Under controlled conditions, in laboratory and growth chamber, sexual 

structures are not formed and the development of asexual structures is not as fast as in 

vivo (Holliday, 1970; Chee, 1978; Junqueira et al., 1984). 

The slow development of P. ulei has made difficult the research on the biology, 

epidemiology, and physiology of the pathogen under controlled conditions, 

particularly in the laboratory (Holliday, 1970; Chee, 1978; Junqueira et al., 1984; 

Sousa, 2010). In old cultures (30 days or older) stromata are commonly formed 

(Junqueira et al., 1984). Stromata are a mass of hyphae that are commonly rounded 

and with a firm consistency that harbor reproductive structures (Krugner and Bachi, 

2012). However, in vitro, it is common to form a compact mass of hyphae, firm, dark, 

very slow growing, often developing either downwards (buried) or upwards (“aerial”-

like) in the culture medium (Holliday, 1970; Chee, 1978; Chee and Holliday, 1986). 

Variation in growth pattern with little mycelium and production of more freely conidia 

can also be observed (Holliday, 1970). Transfers of pieces of stromata older than 20 

days may delay the development of subsequent cultures and even suppress the 

production of mycelia and spores (Junqueira et al., 1984). In 15-day-old cultures or 



 
 

9 
 

older there is a decrease in the production of conidia by auto-inhibition. Younger 

cultures (up to 12-days-old) are more likely to present mycelial growth and a large 

number of spores can be formed in M4 medium (Junqueira et al., 1984). 

The dark color of stromata tissue may indicate the presence of melanin, a 

pigment commonly observed in many fungi (Beltrán-García et al., 2014). P. ulei is 

currently classified in the Mycosphaerellaceae family (Hora Júnior et al., 2014) 

together with Mycosphaerella fijiensis which also forms stromata rich in 1,8-

dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)–melanin (Beltrán-García et al., 2014). Melanin is 

negatively charged (anionic), which implies the presence of a large amount of free 

carboxylic acid residues in its polymer, and as a result they bind to the nucleic acid 

during the homogenization of mycelium (Hearing, 1999). This binding generally 

results in the co-precipitation with DNA and RNA and absorption of ultraviolet light. 

This can interfere with the polymerase chain reaction, cDNA synthesis and induce 

errors in the interpretations of nucleic acid quantification (Eckhart et al., 2000; 

Satyamoorthy et al., 2002). 

Good quality DNA in proper amounts are key features for many applications 

in genomics. Thus, methods for efficient DNA extraction and capable of producing 

pure molecules, free of inhibitors, are in high demand (Fulton et al., 1995; Romano 

and Brasileiro, 1999; Costa and Moura, 2011). Some molecular analysis require good 

DNA quantity and quality (Oliveira et al., 2013). For the analysis of short sequences 

repeats (SSR) or microsatellites and sequencing, for example, the requirements for 

quantity and quality are not so stringent: small amounts of relatively low quality DNA 

can be used. On the other hand, for other tasks such as whole genome sequencing, 

restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq), genotyping by sequencing 

(GBS) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), high amounts of high 

quality DNA must be provided (Liesack et al., 1991; Wintzingerode et al., 1997). 

Different DNA isolation protocols, which vary according to the organism and 

tissue of interest, can be promptly found in the literature (Dellaporta et al., 1983; 

Wilson et al., 1992; He et al., 1995; Prakash et al., 1996). Most of these protocols are 

based on the use of the cationic detergent cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) 

(Doyle and Doyle, 1990; Ferreira and Grattapaglia, 1998; Mercado et al., 1999). 

CTAB solubilizes membranes and forms a complex with DNA facilitating 

precipitation (Weising et al., 1995) and removal of polysaccharides and proteins 

(Carninci and Hayashizaki, 1999; Knapp and Chandlee, 1996; Lagonigro et al., 2004).

Mixed alkyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (MATAB) is another detergent used for 

DNA extraction, usually added to the lysis buffer (Wilson et al., 1992; He et al., 1995; 

Prakash et al., 1996), but has also been used in the purification of the aqueous phase 

(Rodrigues et al., 2007). The use of 2% MATAB in the aqueous phase purification 

of Bixa orellana RNA was efficient to avoid co-precipitation of polysaccharides and 

polyphenols, resulting in the precipitation of nucleic acids free of these contaminants 

(Rodrigues et al., 2007). Protocols with similar components have been used to extract 

DNA of P. ulei (Richards et al., 1994; Rivas et al. 2004; Bourassa et al., 2005). 

Multiple criteria are used to evaluate the efficiency of DNA extraction 

methods, including, but not restricted to, yield, reproducibility and representativeness 

of the isolated DNA (Yuan et al., 2012). Due to the inherent characteristics of each 

fungus such as cell wall composition it is necessary to consider a specific protocol that 

allows obtaining DNA of quality and, if possible, with high yield (Manian et al., 2001; 

Selitrennikoff 2001; Yeo and Wong, 2002). According to Manian et al. (2001), each 

species may require a particular protocol that is efficient for DNA isolation since there 

is no adequate method of cell lysis for all fungi. Selecting an appropriate DNA 

extraction protocol for the species of interest may be difficult in view of the variety of 

methods available. To date, there is no standardized DNA isolation protocol for P. 

ulei, which may be linked to the difficulty for in vitro cultivation and maintenance of 

this fungus due to its slow growing nature and short viability. Therefore, the aim of 

this study was to identify DNA extraction protocols suitable for the isolation of DNA 

from P. ulei. 

 

Material and methods 

 
Sampling and isolation of Pseudocercospora ulei 

 
Samples of leaves with typical SALB symptoms were collected according to a 

W- walking pattern in rubber tree plantations in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. Conidia 

were transferred from the lesions to M4 culture medium (Junqueira et al., 1985) under 

the stereoscopic microscope and plates were kept in the dark for 30 days at 25 ± 1°C. 

Approximately 100 mg of stromata were removed from the culture medium and 

macerated in 500 µ l of water, spread on Petri dishes containing M4 medium and 

cultivated for 12 days at 25 ± 1°C under a specific regime of daily alternation of two 



 
 

11 
 

cycles of 1h light and 3h of dark, 1h light, 3h of dark (totaling 2h light and 6h dark), 

followed by 1h light and 15h of dark to stimulate the conidial production (Junqueira 

et al., 1985). Spores were used to prepare a suspension which was then plated in water-

agar medium and incubated for 5h for conidia germination. Single conidia was 

transferred to M4 medium and incubated at 25 ± 1°C with 12h photoperiod. Among 

the monosporic isolates available, three were randomly selected for the experiments: 

AM18, RPE2 and MAN3P4. 

 
Cultivation conditions and sample preparation 
 

Stroma fragment, approximately 100 mg, of each isolate was macerated and 

transferred to erlenmeyers containing M4 liquid medium, which were kept in an orbital 

shaker at 120 rpm for 15 days in the dark at 24°C. Fungal biomass produced was dried 

at room temperature for 24 h, ground in liquid nitrogen until it became a fine powder 

and frozen at -80°C. Twenty five milligrams of macerated biomass from each sample 

were used for each repetition in all DNA extraction protocols. 

 
Methods of DNA extraction 
 

Six DNA extraction protocols described in the literature were modified as 

necessary and evaluated for P. ulei (Table 1). All experiments were conducted with 

five replicates (one erlenmeyer with culture = one replicate) of each sample. The 

experiment was conducted in two different occasions. 

Protocol 1- High quality DNA extraction (Spanu et al., 1995). Fungal tissue (25 mg) 

and 1.168 ml of lysis buffer (430 l of buffer A – Sorbitol, Tris-HCl pH 9, EDTA, pH 

8; 430 l of buffer B – Tris-HCl pH 9, EDTA pH 8, NaCl, 2% CTAB; 170 l of buffer 

C - N- lauroylsarcosine sodium salt; 130 l of PVP; 8 l of Proteinase K) were added 

to a microtube, mixed by vortexing and incubated at 65°C for 30 min. After incubation, 

385 l of KAc (5M, pH 7.5) was added and the tubes were immediately placed on ice 

for 30 min. The mixture was homogenized and centrifuged at 5,000?g for 20 min at 

4°C. The supernatant was removed and transferred to another microtube containing 1 

ml of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v). The mixture was stirred for 10-15 s by 

vortexing and centrifuged at 4,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The samples were treated with 

RNAse A (100 g/ml) and incubated in dry bath for 2 h at 37°C. DNA was precipitated 

with ?0 l of sodium acetate and 900 l of isopropanol at room temperature and 



 
 

12 
 

incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 g 

for 30 min at 4°C. The “pellet” was washed with 300 µl of 70 % ethanol and 

centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was carefully removed and 

discarded. The “pellet” was kept at room temperature to dry and resuspended in 30 µ L 

of TE (Tris-EDTA) buffer at 65°C for 2 h and immediately stored at ?80°C. 

Protocol 2- High quality DNA extraction (Spanu et al., 1995) plus melanin removal 

(Lagonigro et al. 2004): Genomic DNA was extracted following the procedure 

described in protocol 1, with additional steps for melanin removal as described by 

Lagonigro et al. (2004). An aliquot of 200 µ l of water, 65 µ l of NaCl and 800 µ l of 

CTAB-Urea solution (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1% CTAB, 4 M urea, 1 mM EDTA) 

were added to DNA previously extracted. The solution was mixed gently and incubated 

at 4°C overnight. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C for DNA 

precipitation. The “pellet” was resuspended with 200 µ l of guanidine hydrochloride 

and 400 µ l of 100% ethanol. The mixture was incubated for 1 h on ice and centrifuged 

at 12,000 g for 15 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded and the 

DNA “pellet” was washed twice with 70% ethanol, centrifuged and dried at room 

temperature. DNA was resuspended in 30 µ l of TE buffer at 65°C for 2 h and stored 

at ?80°C. 

Protocol 3- Modified high quality DNA extraction. A modified version of protocol 1. 

Lysis buffer (1.168 ml) was added to 25 mg of fungal tissue and the mixture was kept 

for 30 min at 65°C, inverting the tubes at 5 min intervals. Then, the polysaccharides 

were precipitated with 385 µ l of KAc on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 5,000 g for 

15 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, 300 µ l of 2% MATAB and 300 µ l of chloroform-

isoamyl alcohol (24:1) mixture were added to the microtube and centrifuged at 4,000 g 

for 10 min at 4°C for the separation of phases. This step was repeated if the supernatant 

had dark color (light to dark brown). The top aqueous phase was transferred to a clean 

2 ml microtube containing 10 µ l of RNAse A (final concentration of 100 µ g/ml) and 

incubated at 37°C for 2 h. DNA was precipitated with 100 µ l of NaAc and 1000 µ l of 

cold isopropanol and the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. The 

DNA samples were washed twice with 500 l of 70% ice-cold ethanol, centrifuged at 

10,000 g for 10 min at 4°C and resuspended in 30 µ l of TE buffer at 65°C for 2 h. 

Protocol 4- Doyle and Doyle extraction (1990). Fungal material was ground in liquid 

nitrogen and incubated in 800 µ l of the isolation buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8; 1,4 



 
 

13 
 

M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA; 2% CTAB; 0,2% 2-mercaptoethanol) at 60°C for 60 min. 

After incubation, 800 µ l of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v) was added to the 

mixture to separate the phases, and centrifuged at 7,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. DNA 

precipitation was obtained after adding 600 µ l of cold isopropanol and centrifugation 

at 3,000 g for 2 min at 4°C. The DNA “pellet” was kept in the wash buffer (76% 

ethanol, 10 mM ammonium acetate) for 20 min, centrifuged at 4000 g for 2 min and 

resuspended in 50 µ l of resuspension buffer (10 mM ammonium acetate; 0,25 mM 

EDTA). For RNA removing, 6 µ l of RNAse A (final concentration of 10 g·mL-1) 

were added to the solution and kept in dry bath for 30 min at 37°C. DNA was 

precipitated with a mix of 200 µ l of water, 150 µ l of ammonium acetate and 1000 µ l 

of ethanol, centrifuged at 10,000 g at 4° C, dry at room temperature, resuspended in 30 

µ l of TE buffer at 65°C for 2 h and stored at -80°C. 

Protocol 5- Modified Doyle and Doyle protocol (1990) plus melanin removal 

(Lagonigro et al., 2004). Protocol 4 was used with an additional procedure for melanin 

removal. Briefly, 200 µ l of water, 65 µ l of NaCl and 800 µ l of CTAB-Urea solution 

were added to DNA extracted and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4°C. DNA 

was precipitated and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. The pellet was 

resuspended in 200 µ l of guanidine hydrochloride and 400 µ l of 100% ethanol. This 

mixture was kept for 1 h on ice bath and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min. The 

supernatant was discarded and the DNA “pellet” was washed twice with 70% ethanol, 

centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4º C and dried at room temperature. DNA was 

resuspended in 30 µ l of TE buffer at 65°C for 2 h and stored at -80°C. 

Protocol 6- Modified Doyle and Doyle protocol. Protocol 4 was used with minor 

modifications. Each sample containing 2X CTAB buffer was incubated at 60°C for 60 

min. After incubation, 300 µ l of 2% MATAB and 300 µl of chloroform-isoamyl 

alcohol (24:1 v/v) was added to the mixture and centrifuged at 7,000 g for 10 min at 

4° C. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new microtube containing 800 µ l of cold 

isopropanol and centrifuged at 3000 g for 2 min at 4°C for “pellet” formation, which 

was kept in the wash buffer for 20 min in room temperature. The suspension was 

centrifuged at 4000 g for 2 min at 4° C. The top phase was discarded and DNA “pellet” 

resuspended in 50 µ l of resuspension buffer (same buffer described in protocol 4) with 

addition of 8 µl of RNAse A (final concentration 100 g·mL-1). This solution was 

incubated at 37° C for 30 min and 200 µ l of water, 150 µ l of ammonium acetate and 



 
 

14 
 

1000 µ l of ethanol were added. The mix was centrifuged at 10,000 g at 4° C for DNA 

precipitation, dried at room temperature, resuspended in 30 µ l of TE buffer at 65°C for 

2 h and stored at -80° C. DNA integrity and quantification. 

The integrity of the DNA was verified by horizontal electrophoresis at 80 V for 

2 h, on 0.8% agarose gel followed by staining with Bromophenol Blue dye and the 

GelRED® intercalating agent, in 1X TBE buffer (0.089M Tris base, 0.089M Boric 

acid, 0.002M EDTA pH 8.0). The band patterns were compared with -phage DNA 

marker (100 ?g. L-1). The purity of the DNA was evaluated using the 260/280 and 

260/230 ratios in NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific®). 

Additionally, the quantity of genomic DNA was determined by using the fluorescence-

based Qubit technology as described by the manufacturer (Thermo Scientific®). 

 
Amplification through PCR 
 

To confirm the integrity and quality of the extracted DNA, a sample of each 

combination isolate-protocol of extraction (treatment) was tested by PCR 

amplification with the ITS1 and ITS4 primers that amplify the region around ITS1, 

5.8S, and ITS2. PCR reactions were conducted at a final volume of 12.5 l, containing 

1 l DNA (20 ng. L-1), 6.2 l of Milli-Q H2O, 0.5 l DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide), 

0.5 l dNTP’s (2.5 mM each), 0.5 l Forward Primer (5 pmoles.mL-1), 0.5 l Reverse 

Primer (5 pmoles.mL- 1), 0.75 l MgCl2 (50 mM), 2.5 l 5X Colorless GoTaq® 

Reaction Buffer and 0.05 l Taq DNA polymerase (5 U. L-1). The conditions were 

optimized according to the recommendations for the Promega GoTaq® enzyme. The 

annealing temperature was set at 58°C. 

The resulting amplification products were stained with GelRED® intercalating 

agent and separated by electrophoresis using 1X TBE buffer on a 2% agarose gel at 

100 V for 60 min. The 100bp DNA ladder (Invitrogen) was used as molecular weight 

pattern. 

 
Data analysis 
 

Kruskal-Wallis test was conduced to evaluate the effect of extraction protocols 

on DNA concentration in the experiments 1 and 2. All analyses were processed with 

R version 3.4.3 program (Boettiger and Eddelbuettel, 2017; R Core Team, 2017).

Results 

 
There was variation regarding the extraction protocol that provided higher 

yield of DNA between the two experiments repeated in time. In the experiment 1, the 

highest amount of DNA was obtained with the modified high quality DNA extraction 

protocol (protocol 3) and the least efficient was the DNA extraction protocol of Doyle 

and Doyle (protocol 5). In the second experiment, the best protocol was 5 and the 

methods of high quality DNA extraction (protocol 1) and protocol 3 extracted the least 

amounts of nucleic acid (Figure 1). Although protocols 3 and 5 showed a higher 

concentration of extracted DNA, they did not differ significantly from high quality 

DNA extraction plus melanin removal (protocol 2) and Doyle and Doyle extraction 

methods (protocol 4), for which consistent behavior was observed in both the 

experiments 1 and 2 (Figure 1). 

In the two experiments conducted, the best 260/280 nm ratio was reached by 

protocols 4 and 6. High absorbance was detected for DNA extracted with protocol 1 

(&gt; 2.0) and a very low ratio with protocol 5 (&lt;1.8). The results for protocol 3 varied 

between experiments (Figure 2). The 260/230 nm ratio was satisfactory for protocol 4 

and it was very low for protocol 5 (&lt;2.0). Protocols 1 and 3 also had a 260/230 nm ratio 

&amp;lt;2.0, unlike the values found for 2 and 6 (&gt; 2.2) (Figure 3). 

The integrity of the extracted DNA samples was analyzed on agarose gel by 

electrophoresis and all the isolation methods had a DNA band. The intensity of the 

bands varied between the extraction protocols and between the isolates. RNA bands 

were detected in samples extracted with protocols 1, 2, and 3 (Figure 4). 

In relation to the PCR amplification with the ITS1 and ITS4 primers, all 

samples had PCR amplicons. The PCR products were of approximately 600 bp. All 

appeared as a well defined band on gel, consistent and free of impurities (Figure 5). 

 

Discussion 

 

Each extraction protocol had its own pros and cons, although all methods of 

isolation have produced relatively large amounts of DNA. The good performance of 

a given protocol is probably related to the use of CTAB in lysis buffer since when 

incorporated into the extraction buffer it removes membranes, lipids and promotes 

cell lysis even though the tissue is rich in polysaccharides and contaminated by 



 
 

16 
 

excess metabolites such as fungal structures (Sambrook and Russell 2001, Michiels 

et al 2003, Xu et al 2004, Athanasio et al, 2016). In addition, it still removes proteins 

from DNA (Moore and Dowhan 1995). Although protocols 3 and 5 have been 

outstanding in terms of DNA concentration, it is difficult to consider them to be the 

best protocols due to the variation observed between the experiments. The 

difference in the results obtained for the two experiments on DNA yield is probably 

associated with the growth of the fungus that, under in vitro conditions, produces 

incipient mycelium, conidia and stromal tissue (Junqueira et al., 1984). Therefore, 

three hypotheses can be raised about the differences in results: i. The presence of a 

greater amount of stromal tissue, conidia or mycelium in each repetition can 

influence the concentration of extracted DNA; ii. The successive repications 

decreased the mycelial production and sporulation of the pathogen in some 

repetitions, and stromal material predominated, consequently, there was variation 

in the amount of extracted DNA; and iii. The stroma is melanized and the variation 

in the amount of melanin in the different isolates resulted in fluctuations between 

the experiments. 

The first hypothesis seems to be more appropriate because, although the 

fungal biomass used in each repetition has gone through the same process before 

the extraction, it is not possible to know exactly what type of structure and how 

much they contributed as fungal biomass in each repetition. In addition, in some 

organisms the number of copies of the chromosome may vary according to the 

growth stages (Cooper and Helmstetter, 1968; Donachie, 2001). Thus, it is 

necessary to try a standardization of the number of chromosome copies of the in 

initial tissue to be used for DNA. One way to do this would be to extract DNA from 

the different structures produced by the pathogen, separately. 

Protocols 2 and 4 were consistent in both experiments and, thus, are the most 

representative regarding DNA concentration. In addition, total genomic DNA 

extracted with protocol 4 showed good quality considering that values for the 

260/280 nm (1.8 - 2.0) and for the 260/230 nm ratio (2.0 - 2.2) were obtained. On 

the other hand, for protocol 2 values above the expected absorbance range were 

observed. The values should be between 1.8 and 2.0 and between 2.0 and 2.2 for the 

260/280 and 260/230 nm ratios, respectively. Values outside this range indicate the 

presence of proteins, phenol or other contaminants that are absorbed by the 280 and 

230 nm peaks (Teare et al., 1997). The DNA obtained with protocols 1 and 5 did 



 
 

17 
 

not have high purity, since 260/280 and 260/230 nm ratios were observed to be lower 

or slightly higher than the tolerated range. Variations in the 260/280 nm ratio are 

associated with small changes in the pH of the DNA solution. When the 260/280 nm 

ratio is underrepresented and overrepresented by 0.2-0.3, the DNA is likely to be 

found in acid solutions and basic solutions, respectively (Wilfinger et al., 1997). If 

the 260/280 nm ratio is less than 1.8, protein contamination or the presence of 

organic contaminants such as phenol or other aromatic compounds is suggested. 

However, no phenol was used in any of the protocols tested in the present study, so 

it is likely that the samples are contaminated with some type of protein. The 260/230 

nm ratio appreciably less than 1.8 indicates the presence of contaminants having 

absorbance at 230 nm, such as the TE buffer (Wilfinger et al., 1997) or some type of 

salt (Dilhari et al., 2017). The potential presence of salts at high concentrations in 

DNA samples can be explained by the use of sodium acetate during the precipitation 

phase of nucleic acid in protocols 1 and 2 and the use of sodium chloride in protocol 

5. 

RNA bands were observed in protocols 1, 2, and 3, even after treating samples 

for a relatively long time for RNA removal and using a higher concentration of RNAse 

than in other protocols. The purity of the DNA samples is reduced when RNA is 

present (Romano and Brasileiro, 1999). The extracted DNA should be free of 

contaminants including the presence of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, RNA and any 

other cellular constituents that may inhibit the activity of restriction enzymes, ligase 

and thermostatic DNA polymerases (Asadzaheh et al., 2010). It is necessary to adjust 

the RNAse treatment to improve the evaluation of the different protocols. 

Although all protocols resulted in suitable amounts of DNA for amplification, 

only protocol 4 can be recommended at this time to be used in molecular studies that 

require high-quality DNA of P. ulei. This is a well-known protocol used for plant and 

fungal materials (Corrêa et al., 2013). The reagents used and the procedures adopted 

can be easily found or executed in laboratories on a routine basis. The other protocols 

can be used for other purposes that are not so stringent on DNA quality. However, 

except for protocol 4, none of the methods tested in this study were consistent. This 

result resembles studies in which researchers have concluded that even for specific 

samples, differences in yield and purity of DNA may occur (Artyukhin and Woo, 2012, 

Maaroufi et al 2004, Mirnomeni et al. 2010.

Abstract 

 
Pseudocercospora ulei is a haploid fungus that causes South American leaf blight 

(SALB) of rubber tree in the Amazon region and is a potential threat to the global 

supply of natural rubber if introduced in Asia and Africa. Despite the importance of 

SALB, there is no information on the genetic variability of the pathogen in its putative 

center of origin: the Amazon river basin. Therefore, the genetic structure of P. ulei 

populations in the Amazon region was studied using microsatellite markers. A set of 61 

monosporic isolates were obtained from planted rubber trees distributed in three 

tributaries of the Amazon river: Madeira, Purus and Juruá rivers. Isolates were 

genotyped with a set of 12 microsatellite loci. All loci were polymorphic with a mean 

of 5.9 alleles per locus. The G"ST suggested that there is a group formed by isolates 

collected near the Madeira river and a second group with isolates from the Purus and 

Juruá watersheds. This differentiation between populations can be explained by 

isolation by distance or due to different native rubber tree species present in each of 

these regions. The structuring of the P. ulei population resembles that of Hevea spp.

Introduction 

 
Natural rubber is a commodity of high commercial value used in more than 40 

thousand products in the global industry, including medical-pharmaceutical devices, 

surgical gloves, aircraft tires and several engineering and consumer products (Lieberei 

et al., 2007; Gasparotto et al., 2012). The main source of natural rubber is Hevea 

brasiliensis, a species native to the Amazon region (Gonçalves et al., 1983; Van Beilen 

and Poirier, 2007). Due to the great applicability of the raw material for different 

products, there is an increasing global demand for natural rubber (IRSG, 2017). Asia is 

responsible for more than 90% of the world's natural rubber production, while Latin 

America produces only 3%, mainly from Brazil and Guatemala (FAO, 2018). Although 

Brazil has a large area available for planting rubber trees (Gasparotto et al., 1997), 

yields are limited due to epidemics of South American leaf blight (SALB), an endemic 

fungal disease in countries that grow rubber trees in Latin America (Páez et al., 2015). 

SALB, also known as leaf blight, is caused by a foliar fungal pathogen 

previously named Microcyclus ulei (Holliday, 1970; Chee and Holliday, 1986; 

Lieberei, 2007; Van Beilen and Poirier, 2007) and currently known as 

Pseudocercospora ulei (Hora Júnior et al., 2014). The fungus was first observed in the 

Amazon region, its probable center of origin, in 1900 in the state of Amazonas, Brazil 

(Hennings, 1904). P. ulei is present in all rubber growing regions of the country 

(Gasparotto et al., 1997; Mattos et al., 2003) and under favorable environmental 

conditions can induce successive defoliation, dieback of the canopy and death of 

susceptible Hevea clones (Holliday, 1970; Chee and Holliday, 1986; Lieberei, 2007). 

Due to the severe restrictions in control strategies, the deployment of resistant 

clones is considered to be the best option to manage the disease (Garcia et al., 2004). 

Breeding programs for SALB resistance were developed in tropical America, Africa 

and Asia, but due to the instability of resistance and the low yield of the selected 

materials, few commercial clones were recommended. The breeding program CIRAD-

Michelin- Brazil (CMB) (Le Guen et al., 2002; Garcia et al., 2004; Garcia et al., 2011), 

was successful in obtaining resistant clones as productive as the Asian ones (Rivano 

et al., 2010). These clones can be cultivated in areas conducive to SALB (Garcia et al., 

2011) or in escape areas. Growing resistant clones is an interesting preventive strategy 

to reduce the economic impact anticipated to be generated by the introduction of the 

pathogen in disease-free areas (Garcia et al., 2004). Although moderately resistant 



 
 

33 
 

rubber clones are available (Gasparotto et al., 2012), the success, durability, and large-

scale implementation of control measures depend on detailed knowledge of the 

evolutionary, biological and genetic aspects of the disease causal agent and its 

populations (McDonald and Linde, 2002). 

Genetic structure comprises the quantification of genetic variation and its 

distribution within and between populations (Milgroom and Peever, 2003). 

Knowledge of the genetic structure is important to infer the evolutionary potential of 

a population, since it can provide an insight into the risk of plant pathogens developing 

resistance to fungicides and/or antibiotics, or overcome the resistance of cultivars 

(McDonald and Linde, 2002). Breeding programs for the development and strategic 

use of resistant varieties will have higher chances to succeed if the geographical 

distribution of pathogen genotypes is carefully evaluated; when host varieties are 

challenged with representative genotypes; when there is information about movement 

of genotypes and the risk of introduction into an area; and the dynamics of genotype 

frequencies over time (Peever et al., 2000). 

Although research on obtaining SALB resistant clones has progressed over 

time (Peralta et al., 1990; Garcia et al., 2002), most activities were performed without 

knowledge of the genetic variability of the population. Parameterization of the 

evolutionary mechanisms responsible for shaping genetic variation in the population 

is the first step in the study of the population biology of the pathogen. The use of 

genetic markers allows inference on the evolutionary mechanisms: mutation, selection, 

migration (gene flow), recombination, and genetic drift (McDonald, 1997). 

There are several molecular markers that are used for genetic studies of fungal 

populations, but the microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSR), have been 

intensively used due to the high level of polymorphism, locus-specificity and 

codominant nature (Dutech et al., 2007). These markers can detect high levels of 

variation, which contributes to increase the resolution of genealogical and genetic 

variability studies (Caixeta et al., 2009). In recent years, microsatellite markers have 

been used to study the genetic variability of populations of several plant pathogenic 

fungi, such as Rhizoctonia solani (Zala et al., 2008), Mycosphaerella fijiensis (Yang 

and Zhong, 2008), Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Gomes et al., 2011; Lehner et al., 2015), 

Zymoseptoria tritici (Suffert et al., 2015), among others (Tucker et al., 2015; Das et al., 

2016; Kolmer et al., 2017). 



 
 

34 
 

For a long time, P. ulei isolates from different geographic regions were 

characterized by inoculation into a range of Hevea spp. clones to examine pathogenic 

variation (“races”) (Junqueira et al., 1?86; Rivano, 1??7; Mattos et al., 2003; Bevenuto 

et al., 2017). However, in recent years the genetic variability of the populations of the 

pathogen has been investigated using microsatellite markers (Le Guen et al., 2004; 

Barrès et al., 2012; Hora Júnior et al., 2012). Fifteen populations of P. ulei were 

sampled in the main Brazilian rubber producing regions. Using small and large spatial 

scale analytical tools, high genetic variability was found among spatially structured 

populations and rapid genetic differentiation in sympatric populations of the pathogen 

due to selection imposed by partially resistant hosts (Hora Júnior, 2012). Barrès et al. 

(2012) using a set of 16 microsatellite markers, inferred that the most probable scenario 

for the establishment of P. ulei populations sampled in Ecuador, Costa Rica, French 

Guiana and Brazil (a single population from south of Mato Grosso state) was from a 

non-sampled area in the Amazon. Therefore, despite being an interesting study, the 

results were not conclusive due to sampling limitations in potentially informative 

areas. 

To date, no molecular analysis to uncover the diversity and evolutionary 

potential of the causal agent of SALB in its center of origin, has been performed. As 

P. ulei is supposedly originated from the Amazon, a wider sampling of this region will 

enable the diversity of its (sub) populations to be better understood, to determine how 

the pathogen populations evolved in the center of origin, and the implications of these 

changes for disease management. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine 

the genetic structure of the P. ulei population in the Amazon river basin. 

 
Material and methods 

 
Sample collection, isolation and extraction of DNA 

 

Leaves with typical symptoms of SALB were collected from active or 

remaining commercial plantations of rubber tree located in Acre (AC) and Amazonas 

(AM) states, between 2010 and 2017. Thirty-four isolates from AC were obtained 

from: Bujari (n = 5), Mâncio Lima (n = 4), Rio Branco (n = 8), Rodrigues Alves (n = 

1) and Xapuri (n = 16). Twenty-seven isolates from AM were sampled from: Beruri (n 

= 2), Boca do Acre (n = 7), Eirunepé (n = 5), Manaus (n = 3), Manicoré (n = 7) and Rio 

Preto da Eva (n = 3) (Table 1). The number of individuals obtained per municipality 



 
 

35 
 

varied according to disease incidence and field size. Although several cultures were 

attempted from each field, the difficulties to grow the pathogen in vitro prevented 

the standardization of the same number of isolate for each location. In dense 

plantations, the sampling was accomplished according to a W-walking pattern and in 

each area the latitude and longitude information for each sample were recorded for 

geographic distribution analysis of the isolates. 

Conidia were collected from lesions under the microscope. Conidia were plated 

on M4 culture medium (Junqueira et al., 1984) and grown for 30 days at 25 ± 1°C in 

the dark. The resulting stroma was macerated in 500 µ L of mili-Q sterilized water to 

promote the release of fungal structures and to obtain a suspension that was poured on 

solid M4 medium and kept for 12 days at 25 ± 1°C under a regime of two daily cycles 

of light. The first cycle was: 1h of light and 3h of dark, 1h of light, and 3h of dark. The 

first cycle totaled 2h of light and 6h of dark, followed by the second cycle: 1h light 

and 15h dark to stimulate the production of conidia of the pathogen (Junqueira et al., 

1985). To obtain monosporic isolates, 5 ml of sterilized distilled water plus one drop 

of Tween 20% were added to the conidia produced and an aliquot of the suspension 

was transferred to water-agar. After 5h of incubation, a block of culture medium 

containing only one germinated conidium was cut, placed on M4 medium, and 

incubated at 25 ± 1°C with photoperiod of 12h until colony development. 

The monosporic isolates were transferred to liquid M4 medium and flasks were 

placed on an orbital shaker at 120 rpm in the dark at 24°C during 15 days. The fungal 

biomass was then dried at room temperature for 24 h, ground in liquid nitrogen and 

kept at -80 °C until DNA extraction, which was performed as described for Spanu et al. 

(1995). The DNA quality and quantity were checked with NanoDrop 2000 

Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), while DNA integrity was analyzed 

using electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel in TBE (0.089M Tris base, 0.089M Boric 

acid, 0.002M EDTA pH 8.0). Bromophenol blue dye and the GelRED® intercalating 

agent were added to each well. For subsequent analysis, DNA concentration of each 

isolate was adjusted to 20 ng/ L. 

 

Genotyping 
 

Primer pairs flanking 12 SSR loci were used for genotyping 61 isolates obtained 

in this study. Six markers were described by Le Guen et al. (2004) and the others six 



 
 

36 
 

developed by Barrès et al. (2012). The forward sequences of the primers were labeled 

with the fluorophores dyes NED, 6-FAM or Hex to determine the allelic composition 

of more than one locus at a time. Multiplex PCR reactions were performed (Hora 

Júnior, 2012) using Multiplex PCR 5X Master Mix kit as described by the 

manufacturer (New England BioLabs, Inc.). The PCR products were sent to Macrogen 

for fragment analysis using 400 HDTM size standard marker to score alleles with 

GeneMarkerTM software V2.7.0 (Soft Genetics). The size of DNA fragments were 

manually binned into alleles according to the number of repeat units at each locus. 

 
Data analysis 
 

All analyses were performed with the R program version 3.4.3 (R Core Team, 

2017). Initially, a genotype accumulation curve was generated with the poppr package 

version 2.6.1 to evaluate evidence of saturation and thus indicate whether the loci used 

were sufficiently sampled to adequately represent the potential set of individuals 

(Arnaud-Hanod et al. 2007; Kamvar et al., 2015).  

Genotypic diversity was determined calculating the Stoddart and Taylor's index 

(G) (Stoddart and Taylor, 1988), Simpson index (Simpson, 1949), Shannon index (H) 

(Shannon, 1948), evenness (E5) (Grünwald et al., 2003) and the number of expected 

multilocus genotypes (eMLH), which was estimated by rarefaction of the population 

with sample size of 10 (Hurlbert, 1971; Heck et al., 1975; Grunwald et al., 2003). Nei’s 

gene diversity (1978) was estimated. To evaluate if random mating is occurring in the 

populations, the linkage disequilibrium between the SSR loci was evaluated by 

standardized association index (rd) from clone-corrected data set with 999 

permutations (Brown et al., 1980; Smith et al., 1993; Agapow and Burt, 2001). The 

indices of genotype diversity and linkage disequilibrium were calculated with the 

poppr package. 

Hill numbers were calculated based on the MLG frequency of each population 

using the iNEXT (Hsieh et al., 2016) package for R. These numbers correspond to 

estimates of genotype richness (0), Shannon index (1) and Simpson concentration 

index (2) (Chao et al., 2014). To compare the Hill numbers, integrated curves that 

allow rarefaction and extrapolation were used (Colwell et al., 2012). A 95% confidence 

interval (95% CI) was applied to each curve to compare the diversity in the different 

populations. The genetic differentiation coefficient (G”ST), which indicates whether 

populations are segregating by different alleles (G”ST = 1) or if there is no 



 
 

37 
 

differentiation (G”ST = 0), was calculated using the mmod package (Hedrick, 2005). 

The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) with the genetic distance of Bruvo 

was obtained with poppr package to estimate the distribution of variation within and 

between populations (Excoffier et al., 1992; Bruvo et al., 2004; Kamvar et al., 2014). 

In addition, discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) was performed 

using adegenet version 2.1.0 to infer the number of clusters of genetically related 

individuals (Jombart, 2008). To establish an appropriate number of main components 

(PC) for the DAPC analysis, cross validation was performed using the xvalDapc 

function of the adegenet package. 

 

Results 

 

Analysis of the genotype accumulation curve reached the plateau (Figure 1) 

with the 12 loci used in this study (Table 2).  

A total of 54 multilocus genotypes were identified among the 61 isolates and 3 

to 12 alleles per locus were detected. The P17 locus had the lowest gene diversity (0.24) 

and the least evenness estimate (0.46) (Table 2). The data set was divided into three 

subpopulations, which were defined according to the watersheds of the Amazon river: 

Madeira (M), Purus (P) and Juruá (J). The highest allelic diversity was obtained for the 

P watershed where 2 to 12 alleles per locus were detected, whereas for the J and M 

watersheds the number of alleles per locus was much lower and varied from 1 to 5, 

and 1 to 2, respectively (Table 2). 

The number of multilocus genotypes (MLG) detected for the M and J 

watersheds was similar, 8 and 9, respectively. However, each isolate obtained from the 

P watershed had a unique MLG (Table 3). The genotypic diversity indices of Shannon 

(H), Stoddart and Taylor (G), and Simpson ( ) were highest for the P subpopulation, 

with intermediate values for the J subpopulation and lowest at the M subpopulation 

(Table 3). The subpopulations have similar evenness (E5) values, but it equals 1 in the 

P subpopulation because each isolate was a unique MLG (Table 3). Lowest gene 

diversity was observed in the M subpopulation (h = 0.17). The estimate is 

approximately 3.5 times lower than the average gene diversity estimated for the P and 

J subpopulation (Table 3). 



 
 

38 
 

There was strong evidence of linkage disequilibrium of alleles between loci in 

the total population (rD = 0.061), and in two of the three subpopulations: J (rD = 0.34) 

and P (rD = 0.03). Nevertheless, there was no evidence to reject the occurrence of 

random mating in the M subpopulation (rD = 0.01; p = 0.367) (Table 3). 

No significant difference was observed for Hill numbers when the data were 

rarefied. But when the data set was extrapolated, there was greater genotypic richness 

and Shanon index for the P population (Figure 2). 

There was evidence of genetic differentiation among populations. The 

estimated G”ST was significant when M was compared with the other subpopulations. 

The estimated G”ST between P and M was 0.73, while between J and M G”ST = 0.79. 

No significant differentiation was observed between the P and J populations (G”ST = 

0.46). 

According to the AMOVA (Table 4), the variation was highest within the 

subpopulations, accounting for 70.7% of the total variance, but there was moderate 

percentage of variance among subpopulations (29.3%). Considering the total 

population, the level of differentiation was high (? = 0.2?2, P = 0.001), indicating that 

there are significant differences among the populations studied. 

Another set of analysis was conducted to try to find clusters without any 

previous information other than the MLG data. A PCA was conducted and two clusters 

were identified (Figure 3). Cluster 1 was comprised of isolates from Manaus, Manicoré, 

Rio Preto da Eva and Beruri. While cluster 2 was composed of individuals from Bujari, 

Xapuri, Eirunepé, Boca do Acre, Rio Branco, Rodrigues Alves and Mâncio Lima. 

DAPC was performed by grouping the populations with the first 30 major 

components. The first discriminant axis separated the M isolates from the other 

individuals. Two clusters were defined according to the analysis: one with isolates 

from the Madeira river and the other with isolates from the Juruá and Purus rivers 

(Figure 4). 

 
Discussion 

 

The P. ulei populations of the Amazon region studied in the present work are 

structured, which can be explained by the moderate level of percentage variance found 

between samples. Structured populations were also found to different populations of 

P. ulei from the Brazilian coast (Hora Júnior, 2012) and in groups from Ecuador, 



 
 

39 
 

Guatemala and French Guiana (Barrès et al., 2012). However, the structuring of the 

population in these areas were somewhat expected because isolates were sampled from 

commercial plantations. In the present study, samples came from reminiscent trees of 

old and abandoned plantations. Thus, no resistant clones were planted and isolates 

recovered could have originated from native trees in the forest.  

The high differentiation between the individuals of Madeira in relation to those 

from the Purus and Juruá rivers, the latter being more closely related, may indicate a 

structuring according to the Amazon river watersheds, as observed for their host. The 

populations of rubber trees formed three clusters of populations, one within the 

watersheds of the Purus and Juruá rivers in the Acre-Madre de Dios cluster (Peru), the 

other in the Madeira river watershed for the population of the state of Rondônia 

(Brazil) and the last one in the watersheds of the Tapajós river for populations of the 

state of Mato Grosso (Brazil). The genetic differentiation found for the pathogen 

population can be explained by the geographic distance, an important parameter of 

differentiation between populations that consequently results in the isolation by 

distance of the populations (Le Guen et al., 2009). 

Principal component analysis indicates that Purus and Juruá constitute a single 

cluster. The close relationship observed between these populations may be the result of 

the occurrence of gene flow between these subpopulation. It seems that in the 

populations of Juruá and Purus there is migration effect due to the mixture of 

genotypes found, despite geographic separation of the watersheds. These observations 

differ from the populations of P. ulei in Brazil (Bahia, Rondônia and Mato Grosso), 

Ecuador, Guatemala and French Guiana, in which it was demonstrated that there was 

no   gene flow (Barrès et al., 2012). However, there is evidence for gene flow from the 

Acre population to the areas in the East coast in Brazil (Rio de Janeiro and Espírito 

Santo) (Hora Júnior, 2012). Similar process can occur between Juruá and Purus.  

The lack of continuous cultivation in the Amazon region may have contributed 

to the structuring of the populations and probably the mixture of Purus and Juruá 

genotypes was due to long distance dispersion, which may result from passive 

transport by wind. Passive air transport has been reported for Puccinia melanocephala 

in sugarcane (Purdy et al., 1985), Melampsora larici-populina in poplar (Barrés et al., 

2008) and Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici on wheat (Wang et al., 2010). However, the 

spread of P. ulei by wind is less likely considering the formation of two genetic groups 



 
 

40 
 

in the Amazon region, certainly influenced by the degree of isolation by distance, 

suggesting a gradual dispersion (Barrès et al., 2008). Based on geographical distance, 

the dissemination may have occurred naturally through wild trees in the Amazon 

rainforest or by human-mediated transport of infected leaves in stumps or sprouts 

(Holliday, 1970; Chee and Holliday, 1986).  

The structuring of populations supports the idea that conidia play a key role in 

SALB epidemics in the center of origin of both the host and the pathogen. Conidia 

were considered responsible for the infection for many years and the participation of 

ascospores in the cycle, generally found in small numbers, was only observed in 1945 

(Langford, 1945). These results do not corroborate with studies of populations located 

in different regions of Brazil, which presented predominant sexual reproduction (Hora 

Júnior, 2012). A more intensive sampling is required to properly address this issue.  

A high genotypic diversity was detected in all populations. Similar results were 

observed for populations of the Atlantic Coast and other populations of the Amazon 

region sampled in commercial plantations a few years ago (Hora Júnior, 2012). The 

high genetic variability of the pathogen population may explain the successive and 

devastating infections caused by P. ulei when the Ford Motor Company attempted to 

establish rubber plantations in the state of Pará using high- performance Fx clones 

(Medeiros and Bahia, 1971). In addition, according to studies of physiological factors 

and of variability in large and small scales, the presence of the pathogen in all the rubber 

producing areas of the region probably favors the adaptation of the pathogen to 

different biophysical environments and may increase the severity of the epidemics 

(Junqueira et al., 1986; Mattos et al., 2003). The lack of durability of qualitative 

resistance of Hevea to P. ulei clones is explained by the presence of high genotypic 

variability of the fungi (Chee and Wastie, 1980; Ploetz, 2007; Le Guen et al., 2007). 

Additionally, the existence of genetically distinct populations implies that clone 

assessments for resistance level must consider different pathogen genotypes. 

Considering the results of the present study, resistant clones should be tested in areas 

located in the Madeira watershed and in another location between the Juruá and Purus 

rivers.

Conclusão geral 

 

1. O protocolo original de Doyle e Doyle (1990) foi o mais adequado para a extração 

de DNA de Pseudocercospora ulei. 

2. O patógeno possui alta diversidade genética e associação aleatória de alelos. 

3. Foram formados dois grupos, um isolado pelo rio Madeira e o outro composto por 

isolados dos rios Purus e Juruá. 

4. A estruturação da população de P. ulei se assemelha à de Hevea spp.
