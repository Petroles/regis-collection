ABSTRACT 

 

Collusive practices used by cartels have proven to be extremely harmful to economic efficiency 
and social welfare. Detecting these kind of practices has become a priority within antitrust 
agencies around the world. Regulators are constantly after effective ways to punish companies so 
that the costs of colluding outweighs its benefits. These punishments usually come in the form of 
fines or compensation payments that are calculated based on the estimated damages caused by 
the colluding firm. However, detecting cartel can pose a challenge to economists; it is a data 
intensive and time consuming process that involves estimating a competitive benchmark to 
compare with the suspected collusive behavior.   

The aim of this paper is to review the methods available for cartel damage quantification and 
apply it on a practical case. We start this study by understanding the harm that collusive practices 
used by cartels cause to economy and society. We then explore the different types of empirical 
methodologies used in calculating the estimated damages and the trade-offs of employing them. 
Next, we compare how antitrust agencies operate in the United States, European Union and 
Brazil and discuss their roles in calculating the damages and setting an appropriate fine to an 
antitrust violating firm. Finally, we take make an in depth analysis of a cartel in the Liquefied 
Petroleum Gas distribution market from February 2003 to April 2005 in the state of Pará, Brazil, 
employing the multivariate before and after and the difference-in-difference approaches. We 
found that the price overcharge for the cartel was between 10% to 13% in the first methodology 
and 16% to 17% in the latter.

RESUMO 

 

As práticas colusivas utilizadas pelos cartéis revelaram-se extremamente prejudiciais à eficiência 
econômica e ao bem-estar social. A detecção desse tipo de prática tornou-se uma prioridade das 
agências antitruste em todo o mundo. Os reguladores estão constantemente em busca de 
maneiras eficazes de punir as empresas, para que os custos do conluio superem seus benefícios. 
Essas punições geralmente vêm na forma de multas ou pagamentos de compensação que são 
calculados com base nos danos estimados causados pela empresa em conluio. Porém, a detecção 
de um cartel pode representar um desafio para economistas pois é um processo demorado que 
involve a estimação de um mercado contrafatual para ser comparado com o mercado onde se 
suspeita um comportamento colusivo.  

O objetivo deste artigo é revisar os métodos disponíveis para a quantificação de danos de cartel e 
aplicá-lo a um caso prático. Começamos este trabalho estudando o dano causado pelas práticas 
colusórias à economia e à sociedade. Exploramos, então, os diferentes tipos de metodologias 
empíricas utilizadas para calcular os prejuízos estimados e as vantagens e desvantagens de cada. 
Em seguida, comparamos a atuação das agências antitruste nos Estados Unidos, na União 
Européia e no Brasil e, sobretudo, a forma em que calculam os danos e estabelecem uma multa 
apropriada para uma empresa que viola a legislação antitruste. Finalmente, realizamos uma 
estudo de caso de um cartel no mercado de distribuição de gás liquefeito de petróleo que ocorreu 
entre fevereiro 2003 a abril de 2005 no Pará, Brasil, empregando as várias metodologias 
estudadas acima e abordando as metodologias do before and after econométrico e o diferença em 
diferença. Verificamos que o sobrepreço estimado  para o cartel se situava entre 10% e 13% na 
primeira metodologia e entre 16% e 17% nessa última.

Introduction 

 

Collusive practices used by cartels have proven to be extremely harmful to economic efficiency 

and social welfare. The act of two or more competing firms to coordinate decisions allows them 

to earn higher profits than they would have in a competitive environment. By forming a cartel, 

firms aim at maximizing their joint profits. In such cases, the colluding firms may exercise 

market power by increasing price above marginal costs and consequently decreasing supply 

below the competitive equilibrium1. Not only does this decreases total welfare generated by the 

market, but it also allows cartel firms to appropriate most of the consumer surplus. 

Detecting these kind of practices has become a priority within antitrust agencies around the 

world. Most countries have created laws that prohibit firms from coordinating with their 

competitors in order to decrease competition. However, detecting collusion is not so 

straightforward as one might think. According to Harrington (2004), there are two general ways 

of detecting a cartel: observing the means by which firms coordinate and observing its end 

result2. It is a very data-intensive and time consuming process since it involves estimating a 

competitive benchmark and comparing it to the behavior of the suspected infringers.  

 In addition, since colluding is highly lucrative when successful, it is attractive for firms to 

engage in the practice when they see an opportunity. In a study performed by Ivaldi et al. (2016), 

on average, competition authorities do not recuperate excess profits gained by cartel members, 

even in developed countries.3 Therefore, regulators try to find effective ways to punish 

companies so that the costs of colluding outweighs its benefits. These punishments usually come 

in the form of fines or compensation payments that are calculated based on the estimated 

damages caused by the colluding firm. However, imposing a penalty that is too high can have a 

contrary effect, undermining the firm's ability to be an efficient market player, hindering the

main objective of bringing the economy back to fair competition.4 Therefore, antitrust agencies 

must balance these two objectives.   

A lot of controversy has surfaced concerning the role of the antitrust agency in calculating the 

estimated damages. Some experts argue that the sole role for an antitrust agency is to implement 

a fine to punish the infringers. Others argue that in order to set an appropriate fine, regulators 

must be able to calculate the estimated damage cause by the collusion. 

Calculating damages caused by a cartel is an important step in the direction of establishing an 

appropriate level of compensation to award the plaintiff or estimating the illegal profits obtained 

by the cartelized industry so to impose a fine. The nature of damages calculation will depend on 

the legal framework in place; each country have different provisions as regarding to who can 

bring a claim and to what kind of damages may be vindicated5. It will also depend on the type of 

data that is available and the time and human resource constraints in each case. When selecting a 

suitable approach to calculate estimated damages, analysts will have to aim for a method that can 

lead to accurate results without hindering practicality and at the same time taking into 

consideration the legal constraints, such as information asymmetry and burden of proof.      

The objective of this paper is to review the methods available for cartel damage quantification. 

The text is organized in the following way: In Chapter 1 we carry out a microeconomic analysis 

of the effects of cartels on the economy and social welfare. Chapter 2 discusses the trade-offs of 

employing the different evaluation methods and takes a detailed look into the most commonly 

employed empirical methods in cartel cases worldwide - namely: (i) Before and After Time 

Series Methodology; (ii) Multivariate Before and After Approach; (iii) Yardstick Approach and 

the Difference-in-Difference Method; (iv) Cost-plus Approach; and (v) Structural models and 

Market Simulation. Following in Chapter 3, this paper will compare the strengths and 

weaknesses of each empirical method and how they are employed in different legislations: 

United States, European Union and Brazil. Finally, Chapter 4 will analyze a cartel case tried by 

the Brazilian antitrust agency, Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica - "CADE", in the 

Liquefied Petroleum Gas ("LPG") distribution market in the state of Pará, Brazil.

Chapter 2 - Cartel Damage Evaluation: microeconomic analysis 

 

2.1 Cartel formation in the final consumer market 
 

We first consider a situation where the cartelized good is sold directly to the final consumer. 

Cartel damages can be calculated by estimating the difference between the price actually 

practiced during the cartel and the price that would have been charged if the cartel hadn't existed 

-  the so-called "counterfactual". On Figure 1 we have price represented by the vertical y-axis 

and quantity by the horizontal x-axis. The negative relationship between price and quantities is 

represented by the downward-sloping demand curve. This demand curve shows that buyers will 

purchase greater quantities at lower prices. The graph shows the observed prices and quantities 

implemented by the cartel, p1 and Q1, and the estimated counterfactual prices and quantities, p0 

and Q0 that would have been observed had there not been a cartel. 

 

Figure 1: Cartel Damage 

 

 

The areas of rectangles A and B represent the total estimated damage incurred by consumers. 

Rectangle A represents the transfer of consumer surplus to the producer additional profits and B 

the deadweight loss from goods that would have been sold at p0 but are no longer sold at p1. 

Equation 1 illustrates a rent transfer from the consumer to the producer: 

Source: Davis and Garcés (2010)

	 	 	      ( 1 ) 

The term (p1 - p0) in equation 1 is denoted as the "price overcharge;" consumers will pay p1 

instead of p0 and purchase quantity Q1 instead of Q0. In other words, consumers are charged a 

higher price than they would have been under competition and have a lower quantity available in 

the market6. By adding the two areas, you get the total damage to consumer from the cartel. 

Triangle C, on the other hand, represents the deadweight loss to the producer, or what it could 

have sold at p0 but didn't at p1.    

Deadweight loss is inefficient because it restricts the output available in the economy and pushes 

out of the market potential consumers, who would be willing to purchase the good at the price 

interval [p0, p1]. The producer also suffers with the deadweight loss, however, since the transfer 

in consumer surplus to the producer (area A) is always larger than the deadweight loss to the 

supplier (area C), the cartel is still worthwhile for them. While the deadweight loss is considered 

a problem by antitrust authorities, it is rarely included in the damage calculations due to the 

difficulty of accurately measuring it. In order to calculate the total amount of deadweight loss, 

one has to estimate five elements caused by the infringement: (i) the market output with the 

violation; (ii) the amount of the overcharge; (iii) what the market output would have been in a 

violation-free world; (iv) the price that would have been charged had there not been the 

violation; (v) the shape of the demand curve between (i) and (iii)7. In particular, items (iv) and 

(v) pose a seriously challenge, since they require the analyst to estimate the elasticity of demand.   

Some scholars argue that trebling actual damages may serve as a surrogate measure to actually 

calculating the deadweight loss8. Others argue that if antitrust violators are not held accountable 

for the deadweight loss their actions inflict on consumers and the market, the damages owed

8 The employment of trebling in place of actually calculating the damages caused by the deadweight loss is still a 
very controversial issue among scholars. While some argue that trebling damages can mitigate the effect of DWL, 
others argue that it does not, since it still excludes consumers that were forced out of the market. In addition, they 
argue that since many collusion cases are settled, trebling doesn't even take place so it does not provide full 
compensation for the higher prices consumers who continued to buy the product had to pay (Leslie 2006)

would be an insufficient deterrent9. For the purposes of this study, we will exclude the 

deadweight loss from the damages calculation.  

 

2.2 Cartel formation in intermediary markets 
 

Now, we extend the previous analysis to the context of a production chain, where the cartel is 

established in an intermediary market. If we consider the cartelized product as an intermediate 

production good, used as an input factor by a downstream firm in the production of a final good, 

the direct cartel effect will be reflected by an increase of the direct purchasers’ variable costs10. 

Assume that a firm in a competitive market sells its good to a downstream firm at a wholesale 

price wcomp. The retailer (the downstream firm) sells its good to its end consumer at a retail price 

rcomp. Assuming for simplicity that the retailer has no cost other than its input cost wcomp the 

firm's profit would be rcomp - wcomp.  

Now, if the upstream firm decides to enter into collusive agreement setting its prices at a higher 

level than the competitive price as an attempt to raise its profits, that will affect its direct 

purchasers profit. In this case, the cost for the downstream firm will rise to wcartel and it will have 

to increase its retail price in order to minimize its loss.

Figure 2: Damages with two layers of downstream purchasers 

 

 

This market dynamics is illustrated in Figure 2. The shaded area A represents the overcharge 

earned by the cartel practiced by the upstream firms. Rectangle B shows the fraction of the 

overcharged that is passed-on from the downstream firm to the final customer. The increase in 

costs of its input will make the retailer increase its price by a fraction of the overcharge so as to 

minimize the loss resulting from the collusive prices. It is important to highlight that the shaded 

area B, or the pass-on, will almost always be smaller than that of A, since retailers can only 

transfer a portion of the price increase to the final consumer11. The amount that will be passed 

on, will depend on the demand elasticity of the good; the more inelastic the product's demand 

curve is, the larger the pass-on will be. Rectangle C represents the output effect, or the additional 

profit that the retailer would have made if he could have bought the inputs from the upstream 

firm at the competitive wholesale price (wcomp). Lastly, the shaded area D represents the output 

effect for the end-consumer. It represents the additional utility that the final consumer would 

have gained at a higher consumption level, had there not been a collusive agreement at the 

upstream level. Not only does the price of the final good increase but the quantity of goods 

                                                 
11 Unless the demand is perfectly inelastic, the pass-on will always be smaller than the price overcharge 
implemented by the cartel.

supplied will decrease, having a serious effect on consumer's utility and total welfare12. The total 

harm to the final consumer is represented by the shaded areas B+D.  

Although the bulk of the social costs of cartels resides in the aggregate overcharge, the potential 

effects of a cartel can be even larger than that. The market power gained by firms engaging in 

cartel activity can lead to indirect effects (also known as umbrella effects13), where non-

conspiring firms are enabled to charge higher prices. Not only does it affect direct and final 

consumers, it may also affect the cartel's upstream supplier. A cartel may enforce lower input 

prices from its upstream supplier, either by reducing its overall demand or simply by negotiating 

price as a single entity. The upstream suppliers can pass on these worsened sale conditions to its 

upstream supplier and so on. It also may have an exclusionary effect on a potential competitor 

outside the cartel and their potential consumers.   

 

                                                 
12 European Commission: Policy Roundtables: "Quantification of Harm to Competition by National Courts and 
Competition Agencies." OECD Competition Committee (2011) 
13 The umbrella effect is a strongly debated issue regarding the estimation of damages. The question of whether the 
cartel participant should be liable to pay damages to a direct buyer of an output from a non-participating seller under 
the argument that this seller increased price under the protection of a "price umbrella" created by the cartel raises 
many unanswered questions. (Clark 2004)

We summarize the potential effects of a cartel into three main parts, as illustrated by Verboven 

and Van Dijk (2009)15. First, there is the price overcharge or price effect. The price overcharge 

can be translated into the decline in downstream profits due to higher costs from buying input at 

a higher price from the cartel. If the cartelized product is an intermediate good considered as an 

input factor to an end product, it will also have an effect on the final consumer. Which leads us 

to the second effect, the pass-on effect. This happens when downstream firms increase their price 

in order to pass-on to the final consumer some of their cost due to the increase in the cartel price. 

This decreases the damage caused to the downstream firm but leads to an indirect effect on the 

final consumer. It is important to highlight that in many jurisdictions, namely the US, the pass-on 

defense is not allowed in courts. In such cases, cartel members are held accountable for the entire

2009.

damage caused by the overprice, even if it was not entirely incurred by the downstream firm. 

Finally, there is the output effect: a price increase in a product from a cartelized industry will 

usually have a negative effect on the quantity produced. Therefore, the output effect considers 

the lost margins on units no longer sold due to the decrease in supply under a cartel. 

As we have seen before, in most cases, the customer of the cartel may be a downstream firm that 

may transfer some or all of the increase in the price of their inputs to the final customer. This is 

called the pass-on effect. In a potential damage claim, the defendant might use this as a defense 

to decrease the magnitude of the damages owed to the plaintiffs. To measure the pass-on effect 

investigators have to be able to measure the price increase of the good that was sold from the 

downstream firm to the final consumer. From the point of view of the downstream firm, the price 

increase of the input bought from the cartel is equivalent to an increase in their marginal cost. 

Often, the downstream firm is only able to pass on a portion of the price increase (shaded area B 

in Figure 2). However, the more market power the downstream firm possesses the larger the 

pass-on will be16. As a general rule, the pass-on defense is not allowed in US antitrust cases. In 

Europe, however, it is more common to see the pass-on defense being used in courts.  

 Still, determining which concepts should be incorporated in the process of calculating the 

damages is essential. The first and foremost step requires that the antitrust authority defines the 

concept of "damages". The anticompetitive price overcharge has frequently been key for 

computing damages claims, but simply using overcharge to quantify damage might seriously 

underestimate the true damage caused by a cartel. Looking solely at the overcharge to the direct 

customer of the cartel does not take into consideration the deadweight loss and ignores the loss 

of total welfare. The calculation could also become more complex if one considers the potential 

dynamic effects. These effects might increase damages if a competitive environment could have 

contributed positively to technological advances. On the other hand, it could mitigate damages if 

the higher profits earned by the cartelized firms contributed to higher investments in R&amp;amp;D17.

Princeton University Press, 2010. p. 347-380. 
17 A studied performed by Andrea Günster, Mathijs van Dijk and Martin Carree concluded that in general cartels 
hinder innovation by decreasing investments in R&amp;amp;D because there is lower incentives to invest in new products and 
technologies. However, in some rare cases, higher profits could contribute to R&amp;amp;D investments.  



17 
 

Since these effects are far too complex to be measured, they are usually ignored when calculating 

damages. One might also discuss if the pass-on effect could be used by defendant in attenuating 

the potential damage. Answering these questions is imperative in order to define the theoretical 

framework in which the damage calculation will take place. In this study, we will not incorporate 

the pass-on in the damages calculation.   

 

Chapter 3 - Empirical Methods in Cartel Damage Evaluation 

 

3.1 Trade-offs Between Empirical Methods: accuracy and practicability 
 

When deciding on which approach will best be suited to estimate the damages, analyst face 

trade-offs that have to be taken into consideration during the empirical economic analysis. While 

some trade-offs are related to the economic methodology itself, others concern the legal 

constraints, such as the burden of proof, that will define the economic approach. 

Cartel damage estimation requires the analyst to reconstruct a situation that would have occurred 

if there had been no infringement – the counterfactual - and calculate the price that would have 

prevailed had the markets been acting competitively. In order to calculate these counterfactual 

prices, analysts have to choose from a variety of available techniques. 

The first and main concern when calculating the counterfactual in cartel cases is to be as accurate 

and close to the truth as possible. In order to get there, experts have to balance the trade-off 

between accuracy and practicality18. Quantifying the effects of a collusive conduct requires the 

creation of a counterfactual scenario, where you try to estimate what the prices would have been 

if there had been no cartel. The closer to the real world a model gets the more complex it 

becomes. In statistical terms, accuracy can be defined as being correct on average and precise. 

Being correct on average is not the same as being close to the truth; you could be greatly over or 

underestimating the true value of the damages in one case and still be statistically correct on

Competition Agencies." OECD Competition Committee, 2011. 



18 
 

average. This is why one also has to consider the precision of the calculation, or how close to the 

truth is the estimate. Note that it is better to have a biased and precise estimate than to have an 

unbiased but imprecise one. The more economic assumptions that is employed in the calculation 

the more precise the estimation will be. However, if the assumptions are incorrect, you will 

obtain biased results.  

This leads us to the concept of practicality19. The damage calculation process should be 

conducted within a reasonable timeframe and with the available resources. Antitrust authorities 

experience time constraints and have a limited amount of manpower that can be allocated to a 

specific project. Therefore, it is very important that the company makes the necessary 

information readily available to the authorities or economic analyst. Another key factor that 

helps ensure practicality is proper data submission and presentation style. Economists must 

provide the raw data and any adjustments made to the data and the statistical method used to 

derive your results so that a second expert can easily verify the results. This also facilitates the 

comprehension of the methodology and results by judges and lawyers. The expert must be 

prepared to explain the logic behind the chosen method, so the more practical the approach the 

easier it is to explain. The choice between accuracy and practicality will vary on a case-by-case 

basis and will be highly influenced on the data available. Sometimes, it will not be possible to 

obtain an accurate empirical estimate within a reasonable timeframe or with the available 

resources. In such cases, it is up to the legal system to determine how to proceed. 

Finding a reasonable balance between accuracy and practicality affects how each expert tailors 

his economic analysis. It includes the decision of which data to use and which ones to leave out, 

the number of variables and which method to employ. Working with data submitted by parties 

involved in the investigation will most likely lead to more accurate estimations. However, 

working with public data not only shortens the data collection period, but also makes you less 

susceptible to data manipulation and allows for cross-firm comparisons20.    

The number of variables to include in your analysis is also key to achieving unbiased and 

accurate results. Although it is important to control for factors that affect price, including all

demand and cost shifters, not only leads to an intensive data collection process but also may 

reduce the accuracy of the estimates. If the variables are highly correlated and the individual 

impact of each variable is not of interest in the analysis, it would be enough to include only the 

representative variables and control for the combined effect. On the other hand, omitting an 

important variable will lead to biased estimates.  

Finally, in many jurisdictions, empirical economic evidence is not sufficient to prove a 

misconduct in cartel cases. Investigators are required to present evidence of explicit 

communication between infringing firms in order to meet the legal standard of proof21. In Brazil, 

although rare, it is possible to prosecute and condemn a cartel even when there are no concrete 

evidence of exchanges between colluding firms. In some few cases it has been enough to be able 

to demonstrate economic indicators of a collusion, however in these cases the burden of proof 

were much higher22. The burden of proof for proving a collusive conduct is also higher when 

quantifying damages but that also varies among jurisdictions. Once the antitrust authority has 

been able to achieve the required standard of proof, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant, 

who will then have to prove that the authority's assertions are wrong. When legal standards are 

higher, experts might be required to present more accurate results, which may lead them to rely 

on more than one empirical approach. This brings us back to the trade-off of practicality and 

accuracy.  

Information asymmetry is an important element to consider when discussing the burden of proof. 

In cartel cases, the plaintiff does not hold all the information necessary to prove the damage; 

usually the defendant is the one who holds the information required to calculate the overcharge 

and quantify the damages of the infringement. On the other hand, the plaintiff holds the data on 

the pass-on that could potentially mitigate the damages owed by the defendant23. This creates a 

trade-off on information disclosure among the parties. Tight disclosure rules assures that both 

parties have access to the information they need to make their case but it also results in excessive 

transparency. There have been cases where excessive transparency led to tacit collusion and

higher prices post-intervention, which although not illegal also leads to anticompetitive effects. 

Therefore, it lies within the courts and judges to offer guidance in such matters and it will vary 

case-by-case.  

 

3.2 Empirical Approaches for Calculating Damages 
 

To understand the robustness of any economic model one has to take into account three 

important issues: i) the data used; ii) the assumptions made by the investigator; and iii) 

inferences that can be drawn from the outputs. A model is only as good as the data input used to 

populate it and the theory used to provide the assumptions24.   

 

3.2.1 "Before and After" Time Series Methodology 

A possible simplistic approach in quantifying price overcharge is to compute the difference 

between the cartel price and the perfect competitive price. Under perfect competition, assuming 

no fixed costs, price will be equal to marginal cost. For illustration purposes, we assume a linear 

inverse demand function, pt = at - bQt. In order to maximize profits, the cartel acts as a 

monopolist and chooses joint production quantity such that marginal revenue equals marginal 

cost25.

Princeton University Press, 2010. p. 347-380.   



21 
 

In a perfect competition world, pt = ct
26, therefore the overprice per unit will be the difference 

between the average price in the cartel period and the average price in free competition: 

Overprice per unit = pCartel - pComp     ( 3 ) 

Multiply equation ( 3 ) by the total quantity sold in the cartel  period to get the total overcharge. 

The Before and After method is a time series based approach that can be understood as the 

empirical counterpart of the analytical discussion above. It basically compares average prices 

between specific periods. First, the analyst will collect the historical prices practiced by the 

companies participating in the cartel, both before and after the cartel began and then compare it 

to the prices practiced during the time the cartel was in place.  

The straight-line method assumes that prices in a competitive environment would have grown or 

decreased at a constant rate. Then, the expert will draw a line from the point before the anti-

competitive practice started to the period after the practice ended27. The difference between the 

actual cartel price and the counterfactual price will allow for the calculation of the damage: 

Damages = (pCartel - pComp)*Qcartel 

                                                 
26 Note that the marginal cost in competitive equilibrium is not a given but can be calculated based on the 
information on cost.

In countries where before prices are not available, a more simplistic approach can be applied. 

Assuming that prices are constant you can set price during infringement period equal to price 

after the conduct. 

The Before and After method assumes that the benchmark period represents a reasonable price 

estimate for the counterfactual. It also provides a good estimate when the cartel is stable and the 

basic conditions of supply and demand do not change too much. However, the longer a cartel has 

been active, the less reliable this method becomes. In this case, historical prices are not the best 

indicative of what prices would have been under a competitive market28. Furthermore, this 

method disregards price change due to external factors, such as change in demand structure, 

costs, or in the competitive environment. In order to address such shortcomings, more 

sophisticated econometric models that allow to control for these factors are required29.  

Another relevant issue when dealing with the Before and After model is the difficulty of 

determining the exact date of the beginning and end of the cartel. Many scholars claim to be able

to deliver a rough estimate of the period a cartel was active, but when the cartel is defined with 

multiple price wars and constant breakdowns and regrouping, it is impossible to determine a 

specific date of its establishment30. Transforming this approach into a simple regression 

framework using dummy variables can mitigate this problem. 

 

3.2.2 Multivariate "Before and After" Approach  

The Multivariate Approach is an advanced extension of the Before and After method. It has the 

advantage of not being limited to perfectly competitive markets for the price benchmark. In fact, 

it assumes an oligopolistic behavior of the relevant market. In this approach, the economist will 

run a reduced form regression of the price level on demand and cost factors that affect price but 

are not controlled by the cartel31. This allows the specialist to control for various exogenous 

influences on price, which posed a problem in the previous model. It is important to note that 

econometric analysis does not prove causality but it seeks to establish statistically significant 

relationship between the dependent variable and the other explanatory variables.  

Using the dummy variable model, price is set as a dependent variable.  The investigator then 

includes a dummy variable that will represent the period of cartel activity; Dt = 1 means Active 

and Dt = 0 means otherwise. The coefficient of the dummy variable will capture the magnitude 

of the unexplained increase in prices during the cartel, giving us the overcharge per period. In 

this model, it is important to use only relevant variables so that you do not reduce the size and 

significance of the coefficient, giving a result that translates into little or no damages due. One 

must keep in mind that the dummy variable coefficient will only capture the average price 

increase during the entire duration of the cartel, independent of changes in market conditions. 

Also, the dummy variable is not so efficient in capturing the exact period in which the cartel

ended. Cartels may wind down gradually and not immediately, with prices decreasing slowly as 

the cartel reaches its end32. 

On the downside, this model requires an extensive data base and a large amount of market 

influence factors have to be taken into account. The analyst must be attentive to correlation 

among variables and must have an extensive knowledge of the relevant market and institutions.

If the model results in a positive ?, there is sufficient evidence for the existence of a cartel. 

Overall, the before and after models are practical and lead to sufficiently accurate results without 

requiring too much data or human resources. However, differently from the structural model that 

we are going to see further ahead, it ignores the deadweight loss from the calculation so that 

damages would be equal to the estimated overcharge.   

 

3.2.3 Yardstick and the Difference-in-Differences Methodology 

When dealing with a cartel that has not been stable throughout its existence or when supply and 

demand conditions fluctuated in a significant way along the years, a better way to estimate the 

counterfactual price is to use the Yardsticks approach. This method quantifies damages by 

comparing the collusive prices with the ones that were practiced in other competitive, but 

comparable, markets. It can be considered an extension to the Before and After model with the 

addition of cross-sectional comparison. First, you get the price of a related product that did not 

take part in the cartel and use it as a benchmark. This method is challenging because the two 

products must be similar in terms of demand, costs and market structure and should at least be 

from the same country so that institutional shocks are similar.  

                                                 
32 Davis, Peter and Eliana Garcés, Quantitative Techniques for Competition and Antitrust Analysis. Princeton, NJ: 
Princeton University Press, 2010. p. 347-380 



25 
 

The downside of this method is that you have to control for the variances inherent to different 

products or geographical market. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the benchmark chosen 

is cartel-free or unbiased. If the cartel has effects on related market (umbrella effect) estimators 

of price effect may be biased.  

Transforming the yardstick approach into a multivariate regression allows us to control for some 

of the factors that may influence price. The basic assumption in this model is that all differences 

in price that cannot be explained by exogenous factors are a result of an anticompetitive behavior 

and can thus be translated into overcharge.   

You can also unify the Before and After approach with the Yardstick approach into a single 

framework known as the difference-in-difference. The difference-in-difference approach is an 

econometric method that uses panel data to run cross-sectional data from different periods and 

markets, which increase the validity of the results. If you have relevant data on various regions 

(some that are affected by the cartel and some that are not), the difference-in-difference method 

will allow you to compare the differences in both markets.  

The purpose of implementing this approach is to evaluate the impact of a treatment on an 

outcome Y across different groups. In this case, we will be dealing with two groups: one that has 

received treatment, or a shock, denominated T=1, and another that does not receive the 

treatment, T=0, which will be our control group. The analysis will be performed in two periods 

where t=0 indicates the pre-treatment period, and t=1, indicates the post-treatment period33. Each 

individual or group will have two notations, one pre-treatment and one post-treatment. To 

simplify, let us have ?0
T and ?1

T as the sample averages of the outcome for the treatment group 

before and after treatment, respectively, and ?0
C and ?1

C the sample averages for the control 

group.  

The outcome Yi can be modeled as: 

?      ( 5 ) 

The coefficients ?, ?, ?, ? are unknown parameters representing: 

                                                 
33 Albouy, David. "Program Evaluation and the Difference in Difference Estimator," Economics 131 Section notes 



26 
 

? = constant term  

? = treatment group specific effect 

? = time trend common to control and treatment groups 

? = true effect of treatment 

The purpose of the model is to arrive at an appropriate estimate for ?, that is , given the data 

available.  

The difference-in-difference estimator is defined as the difference in average outcome in the 

treatment group before and after treatment minus the difference in average outcome in the 

control group before and after treatment.  

	      ( 6 ) 

Given the unbiased estimator assumption, if we take the expectation of the  estimator we get: 

     ( 7 ) 

	  

	             

                    ( 8 ) 

The estimator in Equation 7 is basically taking the average difference in outcome Yi for the pre 

and post-treatment period in the treatment group  and subtracting the average difference for the 

pre and post-treatment period for the control group.  

Another way to look at the difference-in-difference estimator is as follows: 

 Pre Post Post-Pre Difference 

Treatment    

Control    

T-C Difference    

 



27 
 

However, like with any other model, the difference-in-difference approach also has its 

downsides. Two assumptions must hold in order to guarantee an unbiased difference-in-

difference estimators:  i) there must be a common trend between prices from the control group 

and the treatment group in the periods before the shock, i.e. treatment and control groups should 

be expected to follow similar factor processes prior to the treatment period; and ii) treatment and 

control groups should not, on average, experience differential shocks in the post-treatment 

period. If any of these assumptions do not hold, then there is no guarantee that the DD estimator 

is unbiased. A second caveat is related to the control group formation. Finding a relevant and 

accurate benchmark, that has similar characteristics to the market in question without having 

been affected by a cartel is not an easy task. As we will see ahead, this discussion was brought 

by one of CADE's advisors in his vote concerning that LPG cartel in the state of Pará.    

 

3.2.4 Cost-plus Approach 

The Cost-based Approach uses financial information of an industry or company to calculate the 

counterfactual price using a bottom-up analysis. The analyst will take the relevant production 

costs and add a reasonable profit margin that could have emerged in an otherwise competitive 

market. Typically, the average costs will be calculated based on accounting data or information 

available from management reports.  

However, it is a somewhat challenging method to employ. First, calculating an appropriate profit 

margin to add to the average unit cost of production can be quite difficult in practice. Also, since 

in most cases the accounting costs do not reflect actual economic costs it becomes extremely 

difficult for investigators to calculate a robust cost estimates. In addition, some may consider this 

method an oversimplification of the factors that affect price in a cartel-free world - it assumes 

that competitive costs and price-cost margin are constant when the cartel is in place34. It is also a 

method with high data requirement and is time consuming. However, it could be a good proxy 

for a counterfactual when dealing with companies in markets where there is a constant 

relationship between price and cost.

Rules: Analysis of Economic Models for the Calculation of Damages." Ashurt, 2004. 



28 
 

3.2.5 Structural Models and Market Simulation  

Contrary to the yardstick, a comparator-based model, the structural model relies on a simulated-

base benchmark to calculate damage. The Simulation method, also known as the "Oligopoly 

Model Method," as described by Clark et al (2004), aims at calculating the relevant market data 

on costs, price, quantities, and profits in a collusion-free world. It uses economic models based 

on industrial organization theory to predict the effect of the shock on prices and output35. It is 

worth highlighting that this approach is the only one discussed in this paper that has the capacity 

of measuring the deadweight loss. 

The economic analyst will build an economic equilibrium model to determine prices, quantities, 

costs and marginal costs in a cartelized industry. Once assumptions are specified and the model 

is laid out, the prices that would have been under competition can be calculated and compared to 

those practiced during the cartel. This model also assumes an oligopolistic behavior, so it is 

important to decide whether you are dealing with a Bertrand or Cournot competition. This 

method requires information on costs, market structure and demand and a profound 

understanding of the market.  

Even though it has an unique capacity of capturing a parcel of the damage that cannot be 

measured by the other models, it is a much more complicated and time consuming method. It is 

highly sensitive to the assumptions made about cost and demand parameters and how they affect 

prices. Also, since it is a data-intensive method it is sensitive to changes in its settings and 

parameter values. Damage quantification based on simulation methods might be closest to real-

world competitive market outcomes, since they do not rely on cost data provided by defendant 

and are very transparent for outsiders. However, not only does it present the largest challenges 

for economists with regard to the high level of market knowledge that is required,36 it also faces 

difficulties in being validated in court as an appropriate damage calculation method. Since it is a 

more complex method that involves strong assumptions on a "would be" demand, it tend to be 

more vulnerable towards courts. Judges and other non-experts may face some difficulty in 

interpreting the results and the model specifications, therefore economists have to be very

educated with this kind of model-building and have to prepare good documentation for its 

replication.37     

 

3.3 Comparing Methodological  Approaches 
   

In order to ensure the robustness of the estimates, practitioners generally apply various 

methodologies to assess cartel damage. In general, different methods applied to identical cartel 

episodes did not result in significantly different estimates. 

The most common method used among the studies was the Before and After where the price 

during the cartel period is compared to a counterfactual price. The second most commonly 

employed method, accounting for 20 percent of the estimates, was the statistical modeling, 

including the multivariate before and after. The Yardstick approach accounted for 10 percent of 

the samples while the Cost Based method accounted for 3 percent.    

Connor and Lande (2008)38 concluded that the Before and After time series method usually 

provided overcharges estimates that were higher than other econometric models applied to the 

same cartel episode. One possible reason for such result is that analysts using the Before and 

After Method may have failed to adjust for all competitive factors that influence the competitive 

benchmark price. The Cost-based and Yardstick approaches yielded even higher overcharge 

estimates. One explanation for these higher estimates is that using cost or profits fail to fully 

account for all competitive industry cost. In the Yardstick approach cases, analysts may have 

underestimated quality differences between the products.   

On Lucinda and Seixas (2016)39 three different methods were tested to calculate overcharges 

estimates for a peroxide cartel in Brazil. Investigators arrived at similar results when applying 

the three distinct methodologies, however, just like in Connor's study, some led to higher

overcharges estimate than others. The time series model resulted in a decrease in price of 

something in between 15.5 to 22 percent after the end of the cartel40. The average corresponding 

damage caused by the cartel was R$109.93/ton. 

The second method tested was the Difference-in-Difference. In this case the investigators 

collected evidence on a market that could be used as a counterfactual both in South America and 

the United States. The price reductions for a counterfactual market in the United State was R$ 

54.8/ton while the scenario with a South American counterfactual was R$ 75.2/ton. When using 

both markets as counterfactuals the price reduction was R$ 67.5/ton.  

At last, investigators applied the structural models to estimate the overcharges for the peroxide 

cartel. To do so, they had to  construct an equation system that reflected the supply and demand 

relation.  

	 	 	 	 	      ( 5 ) 

where, 

 = quantity of Hydrogen Peroxide sold 

 = price per ton of Hydrogen Peroxide 

 = demand driver (production in the cardboard sector) 

         ( 6 ) 

where Wt is the cost of labor and Pt = f(Qt,Wt). 

The structural model resulted in an estimated damage of R$ 68.67/ton.   

These results allows us to conclude that the time series model resulted in a somewhat higher 

overcharge than the other models.  

For practicality purposes, many countries recur to more straightforward methods when 

determining cartel damage in cases of relatively minor economic importance. A simple method 

relies on results from previous cartel cases. This method takes into account the average 

                                                 
40 The values differ depending on the month established for the end of the carte. Three possible cartel end dates were 
tested.

overcharge observed in past known cartels and apply it to any current case. There is an 

increasing number of data on overcharge estimation available in cartel cases which allows us to 

estimate the average overcharges. We can see from Figure 4 that the majority of detected cartels 

have an estimated overcharge between 10% to 20%.41 The empirical evidence of existing 

overcharge estimations suggests a high variation of overcharges across various cases, 

highlighting the need for case specific estimates. Given the high variation and the lack of 

precision of this method in determining the actual overcharge in any given case, not all 

jurisdictions admit it as an adequate measure of effective damage. 

   

Figure 3: Historical overcharge estimations 

 

 

The United States Sentencing Guidelines established an overcharge estimate of 10 percent of the 

total volume of commerce. They then doubled that amount to apply the base fine for infringing 

firms42. Recent studies, however, have concluded that an overcharge estimate of 10 percent is 

excessively low43. Surprisingly, 79 percent of the overcharges were above 10 percent and 60 

percent were above 20 percent. The median cartel overcharge for all types of cartels in the period

studied was 25 percent44. This shows that the fines being currently applied on cartels are not 

nearly enough to hinder the practice. 

In the following sections, we review the approaches that different antitrust agencies apply to 

cartel detection, damage evaluation and punishment.  

  

3.3.1 United States and European Union 

In the United States the Department of Justice ("DOJ") is not required to quantify the actual 

damages that were caused by the conspiracy in order to prove an antitrust infringement; showing 

actual or threatened harm to the competitive process is sufficient. Damage quantification is only 

required in lawsuits where plaintiffs sue for damage recovery. Since damage claims are almost 

always private, it does not lie within the scope of the antitrust authority to quantify that harm45. 

As a matter of fact, civil plaintiffs often build their case upon the DOJ’s investigations and sue 

companies and individuals that have already been prosecuted criminally. This allows them to use 

criminal fines as a benchmark for damages calculation.46  

In order to avoid the complex and time consuming process of estimating the illegal gains 

obtained from the conspiracy, the US Sentencing Guidelines ("USSG") set the base fine for 

criminal antitrust violation at 20 percent of the volume of affected commerce as a proxy for 

pecuniary losses. According to the USSG, "[for] the purpose of this guideline, the volume 

attributable to an individual participant in a conspiracy is the volume of commerce47 done by him 

                                                 
44 This study contained 674 observations of average overcharges and included all types of cartels (price fixing, bid-
rigging, etc). The investigators focused solely on injuries deriving from the transfer of income or wealth from 
purchasers to cartel. For the purposes of simplicity in the calculation, the study disregarded other potential harms 
such as umbrella effect, allocative inefficiency, less innovations, managerial slack, and non-price harms to quality 
and variety, among others (Connor and Lande).

47 The DOJ tends to assume that the volume of commerce affected should consider 100 percent of the sales of the 
good or services involved in the conspiracy. This approach is not always precise and may lead to unfairly high fines. 
Sometimes, only a fraction of the participant's sales has been affected by the collusive conduct. However, 
determining specific ways sales were affected by the violation is not only time consuming and complex, it still does 
not guarantee fair results.

or his principal in goods or services that were affected by the violation"48. The base fine level is 

derived from the estimate that the average gain from price fixing is 10 percent of the selling 

price. The USSG doubled that estimate to 20 percent in order to account for other harms inflicted 

on consumers such as the deadweight loss. This broad definition gives room for discussion on 

how to calculate the actual volume of commerce affected by the illegal conduct. After 

establishing the base fine, the court calculates a culpability score, based on the level of the 

offense and defendant's criminal history. This score is then used establish the minimum and 

maximum multipliers that will determine fine rage49.   

When injury complained by a plaintiff is simply the overcharge, little in required under the US 

antitrust law. Litigants will have to estimate the counterfactual price using any defensible method 

they choose. The most commonly used method is the Multivariate "Before and After" Approach. 

The Difference-in-Difference approach is also frequently used, especially in cases where a 

product is simultaneously sold in different locations under both cartel and non-cartel prices. 

Obtaining the data to run these models does not pose a significant difficulty. Usually, the 

plaintiff has the data from their purchases, which makes it easier to calculate the overcharge. 

They can rely on public sources or obtain the necessary documents from the defendant. In 

addition, even if there are significant uncertainty about the extent of the damages it does not 

stand in the way of recovery. Although actual harm cannot be merely speculated, a reasonable 

inference with approximate results should suffice.     

The passing on defense has not been an issue in court proceedings for at least half a decade. 

Since calculating the pass on complicates the litigation, it has been precluded by court. 

According to the Illinois Brick ruling, final or indirect purchasers could not recover overcharges 

passed on to them by the direct purchasers. It followed the Hanover Shoe decision, where courts 

made the cartel liable for the entire damages to the direct purchasers. However, this defense 

could be argued under state law50. In the current legislation, in theory, direct purchasers may 

claim the full price overcharge, whether there was pass-on or not, and the indirect purchasers 

may claim a part of that overcharge (that was passed on to them) duplicating a portion of the

damages due. In regard to the deadweight loss, no damage recovery can be claimed for input 

purchases not made. The Courts claimed that measuring the relevant elasticity are far too 

complex and they were not willing to make the drastic simplifications to the economic models in 

order to incorporate them51.  

The European Union has a similar approach in setting fines for antitrust infringers. The EU 

Commission is also not required by law to estimate a precise or approximate quantum of 

consumer harm. Given the difficulty on quantifying harm to consumers and to competition, the 

Commission takes into consideration the gravity and the duration of the infringement  and  series 

of other proxies to set an approximate fine. The Commission analyzes the value of the sales 

generated by the company during the period of infringement with the product or service 

involved. Depending on the gravity of the violation they apply a fine of up to 30  percent of 

sales. Cartels are considered to be more grave violations and lie in the upper spectrum of the fine 

scale, between 15 to 30 percent52.  

However, just like in the United States, consumers that were harmed by the infringement have 

the right to sue for damages recovery. The methods used by experts to reach an appropriate 

estimate for the damages incurred will vary on the applicable legal rule and the factual 

circumstances of the case. The most common methods used in the quantification of damages are 

the comparator based methods, which can be further refined by applying econometric techniques. 

These methods include the Before and After and Yardstick as well as the Differences-in-

Differences.  

Another common method is the Simulation model. Experts simulate a market outcome based on 

economic models of competition that replicate drivers of supply and demand conditions. 

However, the simulation model faces more scrutiny from courts and are often times disregarded 

as an appropriate method. This is due to the difficulty that non-experts face in understanding the 

model and its assumptions and also due to the strong assumptions that are made regarding the 

"would-be" demand curve in a competitive economic environment. A third common method is 

the Cost-plus approach.

It is important to observe that differently from the United States law, the European law allows 

infringers to use the pass-on defense in order to reduce the amount of damages due.  

 

3.3.2 Brazil 

Even though Brazil's competition regime has been developing into a more mature regulatory 

system, it is still lagging behind other major countries in terms of antitrust enforcement. Antitrust 

law enforcement was first created in 1994, following the opening of the Brazilian economy in the 

late 1980s53. It constituted of 3 agencies whose enforcement responsibilities constantly 

overlapped, leading to an inefficient and time consuming process. In 2011, the new Competition 

Law reconstructed the antitrust system, centralizing all preventive and repressive functions under 

one single agency, the Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Economica ("CADE"). Under the 

former Competition Act, antitrust violations were subject to fines of 1% to 30% of gross 

revenues registered by the violating firm in the year before the initiation of investigations54. 

However, this guideline was so broad that it led to series controversies and inconsistencies when 

calculating the fines. CADE sometimes considered the firm's entire revenue, whereas other times 

it just included the firm's revenues derived directly from the  infringement. Therefore, the 2011 

Competition Act narrowed down its guidelines in order to establish a closer link between fine 

and the amount of commerce affected. Under the new law, violations are subject to fines ranging 

from 0.01% to 20% of annual gross revenues registered by the company in the year before the 

initiation of investigations in the field of business of the infringement. This led to an open 

interpretation on how to define the "field of business". Some experts argue that fields of business 

encloses only the products and services affected by the company's anticompetitive conduct. 

However, a broader interpretation, usually the one antitrust authorities follow, argues that it can 

include other product or services that may be considered part of the same activity involved in the 

illegal conduct. This uncertainty on how to apply the fields of business to calculate fines leads to

36 
 

risks of including unrelated businesses in the calculation and thus the application of 

disproportional fines.  

Even though major developments in the regulatory system is still required, since 2003, hard core 

cartels has been gaining growing attention from antitrust authorities. Authorities implemented 

the leniency program and built a strong network with criminal prosecutors in order to gain access 

to more sophisticated investigative techniques55. To determine a fair and proportional fine the 

CADE takes into account a series of factors: i) level of seriousness of the infringement; ii) good 

faith of the defendant and its wiliness to help with the investigations; iii) gains or potential gains 

obtained from the violation; iv) whether or not the conduct has actually been consummated; v) 

level of actual or potential harm to competition, the economy, consumers and other third parties; 

vi) detrimental effects to the economy; vii) economic situation of the defendant; viii) recidivism 

(if defendant has a prior history of anticompetitive behavior, fines can be doubled). The level of 

fines when the case is supported with direct evidence tend to be higher. Also, payment of 

antitrust fines does not release defendant from having to repair damages in a potential private 

lawsuit56. 

Besides being an administrative offense, cartel is also considered a crime punishable by 

imprisonment. Usually, the penalty ranges from 2 to 5 years but it may increase by up to 50% if 

illegal conduct caused serious harm to consumers or were active in markets essential to life. 

In recent years, antitrust authorities have also been encouraging damage litigation by potential 

injured parties leading to a surge in class actions aimed at the recovering of collective or 

individual damages. By encouraging victims to claim damages, the CADE is able to amplify its 

deterrence effect. CADE's function are restricted to preventing and repressing anticompetitive 

conducts, therefore it is not concerned with the measurement and quantification of actual damage 

that may have been caused by an offender; damage recovery is addressed in private class or 

individual actions. Victims of anticompetitive behavior are allowed to file suit even of CADE 

has decided no violation has occurred, and they do not have to wait for CADE's final decision.

37 
 

The Brazilian Civil Code set out the right for victim to obtain compensation for any damages 

suffered due to wrongful and unlawful behavior. Plaintiffs may seek damages of all types, 

including pecuniary losses or pain-and-suffering. As a general rule, the burden of proof lies with 

the plaintiff, however, it may shift to the defendant if the courts find that there is a significant 

asymmetry of information and economic means. 

The evidences usually included in collusion cases include testimony of relevant witnesses, any 

documents from the participating firms, and expert examinations. Economic experts may request 

any economic information of the parties involved in order to calculate loss profits or illegal 

overcharges applied to the goods and services in question. There are no mandatory form of 

quantifying damages; experts have to consider the benefits and challenges of each method and 

choose which one they deem more appropriate.   

Finally, Brazilian law also allows for the introduction of the pass-on defense. The Civil Code 

states that indemnification must be measured according to the extent of the damage, which 

means it cannot exceed what was in fact lost by the victim. Therefore, whatever fraction of the 

overcharge that was passed-on to the end consumer should not be incorporated in the damage 

calculation. The burden of proof lies with the plaintiff to show that there was no overcharge 

passed on to the end consumer57.          

 

3.4 Administrative vs. Judicial: Defining their role in cartel punishment 

 
A lot of discussion has been arising in recent years over the role of the antitrust agency 

concerning the calculation of damages and punishment for an infringing firm. Many experts 

argue that the role of a competition authority is solely to investigate and punish an antitrust 

violator. Others argue for a broader scope in the role of the agency in quantifying the damages to 

society. In Brazil, Law no. 12.529/11 states that what matters when determining the penalty for 

an antitrust violation is the undue advantages gained by the company and not necessarily the 

harm that the conduct caused to society. 

                                                 
57 Magalhães, C., et al, Overview of Competition Law in Brazil. "Private Antitrust Damages." São 
Paulo:IBRAC/Editora Singular, 2015, pp 395-414. 



38 
 

Even though calculating damages is not a specified role for the CADE, Ms. Cristiane Alkmin, 

advisor to the CADE, highlighted that damage quantification by antitrust agencies is becoming 

an international trend and Brazil should follow suit. She argues that not only should CADE be 

responsible for the damage calculation, but also that the Judiciary branch should take into 

consideration their calculation when awarding damages in civil suits.  

A similar stand was taken by Auriol et. al (2016) in their working paper. They defend that a more 

efficient solution for penalizing antitrust infringers and to strengthen the regulation of a 

misconduct is to establish a better collaboration and integration of different law enforcement 

functions and institutions. In other words, the different Government institutions must work 

together and in the same direction instead of opposing each other. They argue for a centralized 

database where Government share information on firm's offenses and leniency agreements or 

settlements with antitrust authorities in order to strengthen coordination.    

 

Chapter 4 - A Case Study on Liquefied Petroleum Gas Cartel 

 

This chapter gives an overview on the liquefied petroleum gas market and analyze the LPG 

distribution price cartel instated in Pará, Brazil. We will then apply some of the empirical 

methods previously discussed in order to calculate the estimated damages of the collusion. 

     

4.1 The LPG Market in Brazil: An Overview 
 

The liquefied petroleum gas, commonly known as cooking gas, can be resold in liquid form in 

pressure canisters after it has been produced or imported. The 13 Kg canister (P13) is normally 

used in households for cooking and it is one of the most commonly used gas in Brazil58.  

                                                 
58 LPG may also be stored in recipients that vary from 2 to 90kg to be consumed in industrial or commercial areas. 
However, this study will focus on the P13 cylinders, which are more widely consumed in Brazil. 



39 
 

Figure 5 illustrates the chain of production of LPG. The producer or importer sells the product to 

the distributing companies and the distributors resell it to the industrial segment, retailers or 

directly to consumers in the commercial, residential or institutional segments. In addition from 

being able to buy the LPG directly from the distributors, consumers can also buy it from several 

retailers registered by the Agência Nacional de Petróleo ("ANP"). The most common form of 

LPG found in the retail segment is the 13 Kg pressure cylinders or canisters, exclusively for 

household use.   

Figure 4: LPG chain of production and distribution 

 

 

To analyze the competitive environment of LPG distribution, one has to look at three 

fundamental aspects: the nature of the product, the logistics in distribution and the characteristics 

of the regulation in the sector. It is important to note that from the point of view of the consumer,

40 
 

the competition that matters is the one that takes place in the level of distribution and not in the 

resale59. The LPG is a homogenous product with qualities that are not differentiable to the 

consumer in the purchasing act. For this reason, the company's only way of distinguishing itself 

from its competitors lies in the quality of the distribution services rendered to consumers. This 

makes the LPG a product with very low substitutability and no alternative service to the 

distribution service provided. In addition, since it is a highly regulated market, there is a high 

barrier to entry in the market of LPG distribution. In the state of Pará, there are three main LPG 

distributors that have complete control over the market: Minasgas, Paragas and Tropigas. Due to 

the inelastic demand of the product and to the high concentration of the market, it becomes easy 

for companies to determine not only the price that retailers pay for the product but also the price 

they sell it to consumers.  

Since 1954 up to the mid 1990s, the price policy for petroleum derivatives, including the LPG, 

had been strongly regulated by government agencies as a strategy to standardize price throughout 

the country. Throughout the 1980s, the LPG market was regulated by Resolution no 13/76, which 

not only regulated the price practiced by distributors and resellers, but also determined that the 

resellers were only allowed to represent one distributor. They also established the necessary 

requirements for a company to operate as a distributor and reseller, determining specifics for the 

storage and handling, transport and sale of the product. In 1989, Resolution no 04/89 revoked the 

previous resolution proposing a new system where retailers were allowed to buy from more than 

one distributor. The price deregulating process, however, initiated in the mid 1990s with the new 

regulation Ordinance from the Brazilian Treasury Bureau ("Ordinance MF") no 195/96, which 

fixed the revenues from LPG ex-refineries and ended price control over the transportation and 

distribution and resale margins. A couple of years later, the Ordinance MF no 322/98 deregulated 

the price of LPG sold in bulk or packed in pressure canisters to wholesalers and retailers from 

the South and Southeast of Brazil which would later extend to the whole country in 2001. In 

2003 Ordinance from Brazilian Oil and Gas Agency ("Ordinance ANP") no 297/2003 expressly 

allowed retailers to buy from more than one distributor, with the intent that a bigger pressure 

from resellers would eventually decrease the final price of the product. However, distributors 

operating in the state of Pará were not satisfied with this new resolution and started creating

41 
 

difficulties for retailers to obtain a license from more than one distributor. Based on evidence 

collected during the investigations, whenever a reseller would request to work with an additional 

distributor, they would be denied for various unfounded reasons, which made it quite impossible 

for them to work with a multi-distributor system. In addition, Tropigás, one of the distributors in 

the state, requested that their resellers sign an exclusivity agreement. Whenever the resellers 

refused to sign the document, they would face several retaliation from the distributors; they 

would be charged a higher price on the LPG or the distributor would sell directly to clandestine 

resellers at a lower price, basically leading the old resellers to bankruptcy60.   

 

4.2 The Case 
 

In March 2005, the Federação Nacional de Revendedores de Gás Liquefeito de Petróleo 

("Fergas"), made a complaint to CADE about potential anticompetitive practices being carried 

out by the three mains gas distributors in the state of Pará: Tropigás, Minasgás and Parágas. 

In December 2016, CADE sentenced the company Parágas Distribuidora Ltda. for the formation 

of an illegal cartel in the liquefied petroleum gas distribution market.61 According to the leading 

opinion, the evidence in the case files showed that Parágas was guilty of implementing a price 

fixing scheme with its competitors. Furthermore, the firm was found guilty of creating vertical 

restrictions, such as fixing retail prices, refusing to supply the LPG to retailers from other 

distributors, for requiring its retailers to sign exclusivity agreements, and finally for selling the 

LPG to unauthorized retailers, as means to enforce the collusion. 

The CADE advisor responsible for the leading opinion, Ms. Cristiane Alkmin, interpreted that in 

order to apply an appropriate fine to the colluding firm, the best approach is to calculate the 

estimated overcharge and undue gains for the firm. She suggests that, "when pecuniary sanctions 

are not a function of the damage caused to society, one can make the mistake of charging beyond 

                                                 
60 CADE Administrative Process 08012.006043/2008-37 
61 According to the case files, all three companies in the cartel were found guilty of the collusion, however, Tropigas 
and Minasgas entered into a leniency agreement and settled with CADE and were therefore not tried together with 
Parágas. 



42 
 

or below the 'appropriate penalty' for that damage that was caused to society.62" If the fines paid 

by the infringing firms  are equal to the overcharge sum, the damage to society will not even be 

repaired. The advantage gained through an illicit act is different than the actual damages suffered 

by society as a whole; it only accounts for the sum of the overcharge (total overprice observed 

during the cartel x total quantity sold during the cartel), disregarding the deadweight loss. 

However, in her opinion, calculating damages, even if just an estimate, can serve as a reference 

for the establishment of the fine.   

In the LPG case, the variables for cartel duration, quantity sold, and the price fixed by the cartel 

were available in the evidence collected. The counterfactual price was to be calculated by a 

chosen method for damage estimation. For this case, she chose the difference-in-difference 

approach. The damage calculation will be a proxy of the sum of the undue gains by the 

participating firms in the cartel during its duration.  

The relevant market considered for the calculation was the LPG distribution in the state of Pará. 

The selected period for the cartel was from February 2003 to April 2005 and the non-cartel 

period was August 2001 through January 2003. For the control group, she used two criteria for 

selection. In the first group, she selected the states that showed the most competitive prices, 

taking the average LPG price in each state and comparing it to the HHI. As she observed, the 

more companies acting in that market, the lower was the average price of the state. The chosen 

states were: RJ, AL, SP, and MG. For the second control group, she selected all the states in 

Brazil where there had been no cartel condemnations during the period.     

 However, her methods were scrutinized by another voting member, Mr. Marcio Oliveira. 

Although both advisors agreed on the fact that the companies were guilty of cartel formation, 

Mr. Oliveira disagreed with some of the premises of the model applied in the calculation as well 

as with the chosen method for setting the fine.  

First, he interprets that it is not CADE's role to recover damages but in fact to establish a penalty 

for these anticompetitive practices. When relying solely in overcharges to calculate the penalty, 

one is not taking into consideration other undue advantages gained from the collusion, such as 

the exclusion of a potential competitor from the market. In addition, one cannot guarantee that all 

                                                 
62 CADE Administrative Process 08012.006043/2008-37  - Vote 0255038 



43 
 

overcharges will eventually become an undue gain to the company; part of the increase in the 

equilibrium price may be due to shocks that would have affected the market regardless of the 

cartel. In Baker (1989), he elaborated on the difficulty of identifying cartel formation when there 

is an environment of uncertainty concerning price.63 Simply calculating estimated overcharges 

does not allow you to differentiate undue gains from natural market fluctuations. Therefore, Mr. 

Oliveira argued that a better method would be to take an average of the overcharges result from 

multiple approaches, so to avoid under or oversetting the fine. 

Furthermore, Mr. Oliveira showed concerns on Ms. Alkmin's choice for the control group. He 

stated that it is impossible to know for a fact whether a specific state was a good counterfactual 

for the estimate, since even if there was no cartel condemned in the chosen states during the 

period of the study, it does not guarantee that no cartel was in place. This is a common criticism 

to the difference-in-difference method; although there are some steps that can be taken to secure 

a control group with benchmarks that have not be affected by the shock, it is impossible to know 

for sure.  

 

4.3 Empirical Analysis 
 

In this section, we revisit Ms. Alkmin's calculations in order to provide more robustness to the 

results. First, besides using the difference-in-difference method as the only means of calculation 

as was done by the CADE, we added a second model to estimate the damage. We start the 

damage evaluation with a multivariate before and after approach and then move on to the 

difference-in-difference to corroborate our results. All the calculations were performed using the 

Stata v.14 software and the results can be found in Appendix A.  

To mitigate the concerns raised by Mr. Oliveira on the validity of the benchmark for the 

difference-in-difference model, the states chosen for the control group were selected with more 

scrutiny. In addition to choosing states based on their market competitiveness, like was done by 

CADE, we also tested for a common tendency in those states to avoid using a control group that

Journal of Law and Economics Vol 32, no. 2, Part 2 (1989): S47-S76.

had factors influencing price that were absent in the treatment state. This allows us to test for the 

common trend hypothesis in the difference-in-difference method and to increase the robustness 

of our results.            

In order to estimate the damage caused by the LPG cartel in Pará we used the information 

available in the discovery process as well as data collected from public sources. The dates 

established for the cartel period were the same ones used by CADE in their damage calculations, 

February 2003 to April 2005. Analyzing the cartel in the same time interval as CADE allows for 

the comparison of our results with the ones obtained by Ms. Alkmin. We used the ANP64 portal 

to obtain monthly data for the distribution and retail price of LPG sold in pressure canisters (P-

13) in each state from July 2001 to December 2016. Figure 6, illustrates the behavior of the two 

price series. Although there are evidences of price fixing at the retail level (a demand by the 

distributors themselves),65 it was chosen to use the series for distribution price, where there are 

concrete evidence of a price fixing scheme.

Besides LPG distribution price, proxies for demand shifters were used as independent variables 

to control for exogenous factors that could affect the dependent variable and potentially mislead 

the final conclusions on the effect of the cartel. For such, were used LPG consumption, provided 

by the ANP, income and industrial production, collected from IPEA Data and IBGE, 

respectively. This data can be found in Appendix B. 

For LPG apparent consumption, data was only available from 2007 to 2016, in Kilogram units. 

Therefore, LPG distribution sales was collected from the ANP website and used as a proxy for 

consumption from 2000 to 2006. This data came in m3 units, therefore it was converted to 

Kilograms using 550 Kg/m3.  

Also, a dummy variable was created to indicate the periods in which the cartel was active.  

Unfortunately, data on cost shifters were not publicly available and they were not included in our 

empirical analysis. In the case of the LPG distribution market, the main cost variable that could 

potentially affect price would be the transportation cost, which constitutes of over 50% of the 

total cost of the product66. This raises a couple of problems: first, the cost is a determinant of 

LPG prices and therefore our regression estimates may be plagued by omitted variable bias. This 

may create endogeneity issues in both the before and after multivariate analysis and the 

difference-in-difference approaches. This should not be a problem in the difference-in-difference 

method if the unobserved cost shifters vary in similar way across cartelized and non-cartelized 

markets. If the cost structure is similar, than they would cancel out when calculating the 

differences. However, it may become a problem for the difference-in-difference approach if cost 

structure of the LPG distributors in Pará are different than those in the control group. Second, 

lack of cost information prevents us from employing structural methods such as the cost-plus or 

simulation approaches. Therefore, in this study we will work with an implicit assumption that the 

transportation costs for LPG firms vary in a similar way across treatment and control groups 

markets.

4.3.1 Multivariate "Before and After" Approach Applied 

For this approach, we ran a regression with the LPG distribution price in Pará against the 

independent variables in the periods before and after the cartel, represented by the dummy 

variable. The model specification follows: 

    

	 	 	  
 

 = vector of demand factors that affect price 
 = dummy variable representing active cartel period (Dt =1 active cartel; Dt = 0 no cartel) 

 
 

The coefficients ? and ? are the parameters to be estimated. The vector of demand factors that 
affect price include industrial production , LPG consumption and income. 

In this case, we are looking to analyze the coefficient ?, since it will represent the magnitude of 

the price increase during the cartel period. The results are shown in Table 1:

Results from Table 1 show that an increase in income and industrial production seems to lead to 

an increase in the LPG distribution price. This seems to be the case with consumption as well. 

However, when trend is added to the regression, the signs for consumption and income change, 

which could be a consequence of the endogeneity problem.   

Now observing the dummy coefficient, it is possible to conclude that LPG distribution prices 

were between 10% to 13% higher while the cartel was active. Not only were all the ? coefficient 

statistically significant but also they showed little variation given the different independent 

variable used, corroborating the robustness of the model.  

Following Ivaldi et al. (2016) and Levenstein, Suslow and Oswald (2003)67, it was considered 

sales affected by the collusive practice in order to calculate the cartel's excess profits derived 

from the price overcharge.68 Total LPG sales throughout the cartel period was of R$ 

7,722,887,257 amounting damages to something in between R$ 783,873,056 to R$ 

1,016,331,963.69  

However, the multivariate before and after methodology can be somewhat limited when 

estimating damages since it only analyzes the market in Pará, where the cartel was instated. In 

order to have a more reliable estimate for the damages, it is important to compare the affected 

market with a market that has been operating cartel free.  

The difference-in-difference method, takes into consideration cartel-free markets that can be 

used as a counterfactual for the analysis.

Enforcement in the BRICS and in Developing Countries. Switzerland Springer, 2016. pp. 103-133 
68 The value for total LPG sales in the distribution level was arrived at by multiplying the LPG sales from February 
2003 to April 2005 with the respective monthly LPG distribution price. To arrive at the damages, we used a 
variation of Equation 1, but in percentage, where A = (p1-p0) x Q1 or the total sales multiplied by the ? = (p1-p0)/p0 , 
in this case 10% to 13%.  
69 LPG sales are described in the values of 2005, when the cartel ended. If we update these values up to December 
2016 using the IPCA, LPG sales would have been R$ 14,929,176,194 in today's terms. That would equal damages in 
between R$ 1.5 - R$ 1.9 billions.

4.3.2 Difference-in-Difference Applied 

 In order to apply the difference-in-difference approach to estimate cartel damage, one must first 

identify the treatment and control groups, as well as the period the cartel was active. In addition, 

the analyst has to determine the method and model specifications. It is important to point out that 

the choice of control group was an important element of discussion between CADE advisors in 

their opinion. As previously mentioned, the difference-in-difference method requires two basic 

assumptions: i) the markets for the control group must not be affected by the cartel; and that ii) 

the prices in the different markets must follow a common trend70. These groups should have 

similar characteristics, except for the price shock. The treatment group, in this case, will be the 

state of Pará and the endogenous variable the LPG distribution price. The period of the cartel 

considered will be from February 2003 to March 2005 (27 months), the same period used by 

CADE to calculate the damage.71 The data collected for the control group was retrieved from the 

same sources used to collect the data for the state of Pará: ANP, IPEA Data, IBGE.    

In order to satisfy the first requirement for the difference-in-difference method, the first objective 

was to select states where there had been no cartel activity in the market in question during the 

period being studied. However, knowing for a fact that a market is cartel free is nearly 

impossible. Just because no cartels had been condemned during that period, it does not mean that 

there was no cartel. Due to the difficulty of detecting cartels, it is possible that a cartel could be 

operating in any given state without the knowledge of the authorities. Therefore,  the states 

which demonstrated to have a lower market concentration based on the Herfindahl Index (HHI) 

were the main focus of the analysis. The HHI was calculated for all the states in Brazil in 200772 

and in 2016. Although this method does not eliminate the danger of using a state where a cartel 

was active but unknown, it is a way to mitigate these risks. Based on the HHI, were chosen the 

states of São Paulo, Pernambuco, Santa Catarina and Paraná, which were the only four states 

which presented a HHI below 0.25 in 2007 and maintained a similar level of competitiveness in 

2016, as seen on Figure 7.  
                                                 
70 Lucinda, Claudio and Renato Seixas, "Prevenção Ótima de Cartéis: O Caso dos Peróxidos no Brasil." 
Departamento de Estudos Econômicos do CADE. (2016). 
71 In order to determine the estimated period for the cartel activity, CADE used evidence collected during the 
investigation, including recordings from company employees and other documents that indicated a February as the 
most probable date for the beginning of the cartel and March 2005 as its dissolution.  
72 The year of 2007 was the earliest data available for LPG consumption. As mentioned earlier, for the years 
between 2000 to 2006, a proxy was used.

To satisfy the second condition for the difference-in-difference model, the prices for the state of 

Pará and the control group were tested for a common trend. The first analysis consisted of a 

visual inspection of the LPG distribution prices in both the treatment and control groups.  

In Figure 8, it is possible to see that Pará's price curve becomes steeper than that of the other 

states around March 2003. Although there is an upward trend in price among all the states, it 

seems that the increase in Pará around the period of the beginning of the cartel was more 

significant than in the others state of the control group.

In addition, a more formal trend test was performed in order to confirm the conclusions from the 

visual inspection and give us more reliable results. Table 2 shows the outputs for the global 

common trend test conducted with the control group. We will focus on the second regression, 

which takes into consideration the fixed effects. The idea of the common tendency test using 

fixed effects is that it allows for the control of non-observable variables that do not change 

throughout time.

In this case, the variable "trend" is the average trend for the state of Pará. The second column 

shows that the trend coefficients for São Paulo and Pernambuco are not statistically significant, 

which means that there is evidence of a common trend for these states. In other words, the trend 

in these states do not diverge from the "trend" variable. The coefficients for Santa Catarina and 

Paraná, on the other hand, strongly suggest the contrary, which means that some shock other than 

the cartel is making the trend in these states diverge from the one in Pará. This leads us to 

reconsider them as a good benchmark for the control group.      

Lastly, a local common trend test, which allows for the treatment variable to interact with time 

dummies, was carried out. The objective of this test was to create interactions of time dummies 

and the treatment indicator for the first two pre-treatment periods and two post-treatment periods. 

After creating the pre and post-treatment dummies, the following model was regressed:        

  ( 6 ) 

where y is the outcome for state i at time t and ? and ? are state and time fixed effects. 

In order to validate the difference-in-difference assumption, the pre-treatment dummies should 

be the same for both the control and treatment groups, which means that they should not be 

statistically significant. In addition, the post-treatment coefficients, ?+1 and ?+2, should be 

positive and statistically significant. The intuition here is that prices should follow a common 

trend in the pre-treatment period and diverge after the shock in the post-treatment period.       

 Table 3 shows the results of the local common trend test. Column 1 includes all four states in the 

control group throughout the entire period, July 2001 through December 2016. Column 2 

shortens the time frame of the analysis to a short period before and after the beginning to the 

cartel, that is January 2002 through December 2003.73 The reason for decreasing the range period 

being analyzed was to avoid capturing any other shocks that might have taken place in the LPG 

distribution price besides the cartel in the post-treatment period. Columns 3 and 4 follow the 

same considerations as Columns 1 and 2, respectively, but only include São Paulo and 

Pernambuco in the control group.    

                                                 
73 Remembering that according to the evidence collected by CADE, the beginning of the cartel was dated in 
February 2003 and its dissolution was considered to have taken place in April 2005. Therefore, I chose to consider a 
period one year before its beginning and 10 months after. Columns 2 and 4 of the local common trend test does not 
consider the entire period of the cartel. 



53 
 

Table 3: Local Common Trend Test 

 

 

Based on the results for Column 1, we reject the null hypothesis at a 90% confidence level for 

the month of  April 2003, but not at 95%. This seems to be saying that the price increase of the 

cartel started to pick up at around the month of April and not in February when the cartel was 

actually instated. Moreover, in the joint significance test for the months of December 2002 and 

March 2003, we do not reject the null hypothesis, ?-1= ?-2=0, reinforcing the conclusions from 

the previous tests that there is in a common tendency between the treatment and control groups 

before the cartel shock. However, for the post treatment joint significant test, ?1= ?2=0, we reject 

the null hypothesis, proving that there was in fact a shock in that period. 

The joint significance tests performed for the data in Columns 2 and 4 showed similar results. 

We do not reject the null hypothesis for the pre-treatment period at a 5% significance level but

reject it for the post-treatment period. These results validate our common trend test. Given the 

two common trend test, our control group will be restricted to Pernambuco and São Paulo. The 

outputs for the common tendency tests can be found in Appendix A.  

Finally, after the two premises for the difference-in-difference approach have been accounted 

for, we can model its outcome: 

   ( 7 ) 

Pit = LPG distribution price in state i in time t 

?N = unknown parameters to be estimated 

N = 0,...,4 

Si = state dummy or fixed effects (1 = Pará; 0 = Not Pará) 

Tt = time trend common to control group and treatment groups 

? = endogenous variables vector 

?it = error   

 

In this model, the coefficient we are effectively interested in is ?3, or average overprice.

Table 4: Difference-in-Differences Regression 

 

 

The results for the difference-in-difference regression can be found in Table 4. We will focus on 

the results from Columns 3 and 4, which includes only São Paulo and Pernambuco in the control 

group. Column 3 included the data from the period between July 2001 to December 2016. Its 

output shows an overprice of 16.96% in LPG distribution price during the cartel, awarding the 

cartel participants an extra gain of almost R$ 1.3 billion74.  

In Column 4 we restricted the period of the analysis from February 2002 to December 2003, for 

the same reason we did in the local common tendency test: to avoid shocks other than the cartel 

overprice from influencing our results. As we can see from the output in Column 4, the overprice 

was similar to that in Column 3, however slightly smaller. The results indicated that the cartel 

was operating with prices 15.97% higher than it would have in perfect competition, amounting to

over R$ 1.2 billion in undue gains.75 It is important to highlight that the price overcharge result 

in the model in which the control group included only Pernambuco and São Paulo was almost 

two and a half times larger than it was in the model including all four states (6.76%). This could 

indicate that there probably were other shocks influencing the LPG distribution prices in the two 

states we excluded from the analysis.   

As we can see from the results, the price overcharge calculated by the difference-in-difference 

method utilizing a more restricted and scrutinized control group gave us a value much larger than 

what was estimated by Ms. Alkmin in her calculations for the CADE. However, it was consistent 

with the conclusions arrived by Connor and Lande in their study in which they calculated the 

modal average overcharges in between 10 to 20 percent. This shows how the difference-in-

difference model can be sensitive to the choice of a control group; restricting the control group 

may have a significant influence on the results. 

Conclusion 

 

Quantifying cartel damages has been gaining momentum among antitrust authorities around the 

world, Brazil included. Even though there have been major discussions on the role of a 

competition agency, more specifically on whether it has jurisdiction to calculate estimated 

damages or not, it seems that more and more agencies been bringing it upon them to do so.  

Given the several different methodologies available for that purpose, analysts face the difficult 

task of choosing the most appropriate approach for calculation while at the same time finding 

balance between accuracy and practicality. As discussed along this paper, some methods are able 

to return more accurate results but they also require more data and assumptions and are much 

more time consuming. On the other hand, there are other methods, such as before and after 

approaches and difference-in-difference methods, used in this paper to estimate damages, that are 

more practical and less data intensive but gives less accurate results.      

The objective of this paper was to select among the existing methods, one that could give us 

accurate results in a timely manner. The Multivariate Before and After method indicated an 

                                                 
75 Updating the damages up to December 2016 using the IPCA, we arrive at damages amount in between R$ 2.2 to 
R$ 2.4 billions.

overcharge of between 10% to 13% in the distribution prices of LPG in Pará. The difference-in-

difference model estimated an overcharge of something in between 15.97% to 16.96%. These 

result is consistent with the study performed by Connor and Lande (2008) where they caclulated 

the mode of overcharges in between 10 to 20 percent. However, our results showed some 

inconsistencies with the same study; Connor and Lande concluded that the Before and After 

method gave higher overcharge results on average than other econometric models, such as the 

difference-in-difference. Yet, results for our difference-in-difference method showed higher 

results than the multivariate before and after method. Also, the results obtained in our study were 

higher than the the results obtained by Ms. Alkmin in her difference-in-difference model: 4% to 

8.2%.      

Even though the results from this study seem to be consistent with average overcharges found in 

the academic literature and with the results calculated by CADE, there are always improvements 

that can be made to refine the calculations even further. First, we could adopt the synthetic 

control method in the difference-in-difference estimation to improve the results. The synthetic 

control method builds on the difference-in-difference model to evaluate the causal effects of 

shocks. It makes two essential changes to the model: i) it allows for time-varying individual-

specific heterogeneity; and ii) takes a serious, data driven approach to forming counterfactuals. It 

basically uses longitudinal data to build a weighted average of non-treated units that best 

reproduces the characteristics of the treated unit over time, prior to the treatment.76 This 

approach relaxes the previous hypothesis that the benchmark market should not be affected by 

the shock and that there must be a common tendency between the treatment and control groups 

in the pre-treatment period. Therefore, it allows us to forgo the common tendency tests that were 

performed in this study. However, like all other methods, it comes at a cost: its computational 

time far exceeds that of the difference-in-difference estimation, leading us back to the 

practicality versus accuracy issue.    

In addition, it would be important that in future studies we find available data on cost shifters, 

mainly transportation costs, so to enable us to calculate the deadweight loss using the structural 

models. This would allow for the construction of a supply and demand structural model that

could potentially calculate the impact of the total loss of welfare to society. Although it requires 

a large data base, it is the model that best simulates the "real world".
