ABSTRACT

The Hospitais Massif is an elliptical-shaped plutonic body, with a WNW-ESE long axis, located in the
western Ossa-Morena Zone domains in Portugal. This massif, composed essentially of tonalites, is part of
an igneous association, ranging from gabbros to granites, intrusive in a gneissic-migmatitic complex, as
part of the Évora High-grade Metamorphic Terrains. The tonalites present magmatic fabrics associated
with a moderately developed foliation, recording syntectonic crystallization and cooling, co-planar to
steep foliations observed within the surrounding sheared gneisses and migmatites.  From field and
petrographic studies, it is possible to suggest that the deformation of the tonalites and associated basic
rocks was synchronous with Variscan progressive shearing of the gneisses and migmatites envelope.

Key words: tonalites, gabbros, dioritic enclaves, Variscan orogeny, Ossa-Morena Zone

RESUMEN

El Macizo de Hospitais corresponde a un plutón elíptico de orientación ONO-ESE localizado en los domínios
occidentales de la Zona de Ossa Morena, en Portugal. Este macizo, constituido por una asociación ígnea
que incluye desde gabros hasta granitos y en la que son dominantes las tonalitas, está intruida en un
complejo de gneises y migmatitas perteneciente a los Terrenos de Alto-grado Metamórfico de Évora. Las
tonalitas muestran fabricas magmáticas asociadas a una foliación moderadamente desarrollada durante la
cristalización y enfriamiento, paralelas a la foliación subvertical observada en los gneises y migmatitas del
encajante. Las evidencias de campo y los estudios petrográficos permiten sugerir que la deformación de
las tonalitas y rocas básicas asociadas que afloran cerca de Montemor-o-Novo, fue contemporánea con el
progresivo cizallamiento Varisco observado en los gneises y migmatitas del encajante.

Introduction

Geologically, south-central Portugal is
part of SW Iberian Massif where is located
the Ossa-Morena Zone (OMZ), one of the
major geotectonic divisions of the western
European Variscan Chain (Julivert et al.,
1972). One important characteristic of the
OMZ is the presence of distinguishable
structural, paleogeographic and magmatic-
metamorphic domains, as recognized by
Chacón et al. (1983), Apalategui et al. (1990)
and Oliveira et al., (1991). In the western Ossa-
Morena Zone exists a large area covering
approximately 75 km2 (the Évora Massif; e.g.

Carvalhosa, 1983; Quesada and Munhá, 1990)
where the magmatism and high-grade
metamorphism related with the Variscan
orogeny is well exposed. Recently, with the
purpose of clarifying the complex internal
structure of the Évora Massif, Pereira et al.
(2003) defined the Évora High-Grade
Metamorphic Terrains (EHMT) as a major
tectonic unit composed by a complex
assemblage of migmatites and gneisses,
intruded by syn-orogenic basic to acid
plutonic rocks and late-orogenic
porphyritic granites. The same authors
interpret these high-grade metamorphic rocks
as the result of Variscan HT-LP metamorphism

developed over Neoproterozoic (Serie Negra)
and Lower Palaeozoic rocks.

The Hospitais Massif (Carvalhosa and
Zbyszweski, 1994) occupies the northwest
end of the EHMT, close to the town of
Montemor-o-Novo, and it corresponds to a
tonalitic body with an elliptical shape (15km
long x 6km width) oriented sub-parallel to the
regional Variscan foliation (WNW-ESE
striking deformation fabrics) in the region. The
tonalitic pluton intrudes mainly gneisses and
migmatites, except in its northern boundary,
where it contacts a prominent amphibolitic
layer. To the west, Tertiary sediments cover
both tonalites and country rocks.

Gabbroic rocks occur within the
EHMT, as several WNW-ESE elongated
bodies (Fig.1), intrusive in the gneissic-
migmatitic complex. Their lengths usually
fall between several hundred meters and
few kilometres.

Field relations and Petrography

This work is focused on the following
rock types: (1) tonalite, constituting the
main lithology of the Hospitais Massif
(HM); (2) leucotonalitic layers, locally
intercalated in the former lithology; (3)
microgranular dioritic enclaves hosted by
the tonalite; (4) gabbros, forming small
intrusions in the EHMT, but outside the
Hospitais Massif.

Main tonalite
The dominant tonalite in the Hospitais

Massif is monotonous, with small
petrographic variation. Texturally, it is
hypidiomorphic granular and shows medium
to coarse grain size. A WNW-ESE foliation,
defined by the alignment of mafic minerals
(biotite and amphibole), is often observed
(Fig.2). Concerning the mineralogy, the
dominant phases in the tonalite are plagioclase
(40-50%) and quartz (20-30%), whereas the
ferromagnesian silicates do not exceed 20 to

30% of rock volume. The relative proportions
of amphibole and biotite are quite variable
from sample to sample: either one or the other
may be the most important mafic phase. The
most common accessory minerals are apatite,
oxides, zircon and allanite.

Plagioclase has composition of
andesine and forms subhedral grains
(length: 2-4 mm) that commonly display
either continuous or discontinuous complex
zoning (Fig. 3A). Sometimes, these grains
contain inclusions of sub-millimetric
corroded plagioclase crystals. Another
essential felsic mineral is quartz, whose
grains are always anhedral with contours
adapting to the forms of plagioclase, biotite
and amphibole. Wavy extinction and/or
subgranulation reveal that quartz was
submitted to recovery processes.

Two types of amphibole - hornblende
and cummingtonite, typically in close
association (Fig. 3B)- may be found in the
tonalite. Hornblende is systematically
present and is one of the most important
mafic phases, whilst cummingtonite occurs
in a highly variable proportion between
samples, from almost absent to 20-30% of total
amphibole. Typically, amphibole grains are 2-
4 mm long and have subhedral forms. When
the two amphiboles are present, they associate
to each other, with the hornblende rimming the

cummingtonite. Occasionally, the biggest
crystals of amphibole develop a poikilitic
texture, including small euhedral and
subhedral crystals of plagioclase, oxides
and apatite. The other major mafic mineral
– biotite - forms subhedral crystals, whose
maximum length sometimes achieves 6
mm, and commonly envelops opaques and
apatite.

Considering the accessory phases, their
most significant features are the following:
opaque minerals are commonly spatially
related to the main mafic minerals, showing
euhedral and subhedral shapes; apatite
forms small (tenths of mm) euhedral
prismatic crystals; zircon was almost
always observed as euhedral grains with
hundredths or tenths of mm; allanite was
found only sporadically, as anhedral to
subhedral grains hosted by amphibole or
biotite.

Although primary minerals are usually
well preserved in the collected samples,
plagioclase may contain sericite, whereas
biotite is occasionally replaced by chlorite
plus epidote.

Leucotonalitic Layers
Locally, it is possible to observe some

centimetric layers impoverished in mafic
phases (Leucotonalitic Layers – LTL, Fig.
2B) that are commonly parallel or slightly
oblique to the foliation, although they also
can be seen, rarely, cutting that structure.
Within these discordant layers, it is possible
to identify an internal fabric defined by the
alignment of undeformed grains of mafic
minerals and feldspars.

At the two existing quarries in the
Hospitais Massif, there is a vertical
magmatic layering characterized by the
alternation of (1) bands of particularly
quartz-rich and mafic-poor tonalite, and (2)
levels with modal composition similar to
that of the main tonalite.

Mafic enclaves
Dark-coloured enclaves, displaying

well-rounded outlines, ovoid forms and sharp
limits, occur sparingly within the main
tonalite. They show variable dimensions, from
2 to 40 cm long and from 0.5 to 6 cm wide, and
represent, when present, a small percentage of
the outcrop area: 1-2% and sometimes less.
Mineralogically, all the studied enclaves show
dominance of amphibole. Two petrographic
groups based on the type of the amphibole,
relative volume of ferromagnesian minerals
and granularity were defined: hornblendic
enclaves (HbE) and cummingtonitic-
hornblendic enclaves (Cm-HbE).

The HbE enclaves are medium-grained
(2mm) and have a hypidiomorphic granular
texture. Modally, they may be classified as

diorites: hornblende is the most important
mineral (40-50%), followed by plagioclase
(30-50%) and quartz (5%). Cummingtonite
is characteristically absent, but, sometimes,
hornblende shows mimetic features
(specially “ghosts” of a previous fine
twinning) after the ferromagnesian
amphibole. Hornblende occurs as euhedral/
subhedral crystals (~ 2mm) occasionally
containing plagioclase, apatite and opaque
inclusions. When in contact with
plagioclase, amphibole grains tend to adapt
to the feldspar contours. Crystals of
plagioclase (andesine-labradorite) typically
exhibit subhedral forms and display
complex continuous zoning. The oxide
minerals have subhedral habit and, in some
samples, reach 4-5% of the mode. In these
enclaves, biotite occurs in small amounts,
but it may show a poikilitic development.
Quartz is anhedral with lamellar
subgranulation.

The Cm-HbE enclaves are
distinguished from the previous type
mainly by (1) the significant amounts of
both amphiboles (hornblende and
cummingtonite), (2) the seriate texture with
dominance of relatively small grains
(&lt;2mm) and (3) the systematic presence, as
an accessory phase, of biotite. These
enclaves have modal compositions typical
of diorites or microdiorites, since
plagioclase (50-60%) and amphibole (30-
35%) are largely dominant. Quartz (~5%)
and biotite (1-2%) are other significant
phases, whilst opaques and apatite only
occur in very small amounts. Plagioclase
(labradorite) grains are anhedral and their
dimensions vary from 0.5 to 1-2mm (rarely
4mm). The  b i g g e s t  c r y s t a l s  h a v e

complex nature - and diffuse twinning, in
contrast with the sub-millimetric grains,
which show well-defined twinning and
minor zoning. In several cases, well
developed plagioclase preserve cores that
seem to have been reworked. Amphiboles
are usually present in aggregates of small
(usually, less than 250ìm in length) and
irregularly shaped grains. In those sets of
crystals, both hornblende and
cummingtonite are present, in a proportion
of approximately 60:40, and the
ferromagnesian amphibole is confined to a
central position. Biotite is a subordinate
phase occurring as small and elongated
grains; it is occasionally replaced by
chlorite and epidote. The crystals of
apatite, characteristically euhedral and
elongated (axial ratios 3:1 - 5:1 and some
acicular), are usually associated with the
felsic minerals. Quartz is anhedral with
lamellar subgranulation and opaques are
manly associated with the felsic minerals.

Leucotonalitic halos
Surrounding the mafic enclaves it is

sometimes possible to observe 1-3cm thick
leucotonalitic halos (LTH) (Fig.2C). The
grain size of the halo is similar to that of the
host tonalite. The felsic minerals
(plagioclase and quartz) strongly
predominate, whereas the mafic phases
(hornblende ± cummingtonite ± biotite)
represent only 5% of the modal
composition. Zircon occurs as an important
accessory phase. Plagioclase shows
complex and discontinuous zoning, as well
as some deformation features like wedge
twinning. The quartz is more abundant in
the halos than in the surrounding tonalite
and shows lamellar subgranulation.

Mafic rocks
Gabbros occur as small isolated outcrops

with no direct contact with the HM. They are
predominantly medium grained rocks with
hypidiomorphic granular textures, but, in
some cases, poikilitic textures developed.
Brown hornblende (30-40%), clinopyroxene
(20-30%) and plagioclase (30-40%) are the
essential minerals, whilst opaques and
apatite are the accessory phases. The
amphibole commonly envelops the other
primary minerals, especially plagioclase, and
it may constitute oikocrysts (reaching 5mm).
Pyroxene is present as isolated corroded
nuclei (0.25-0.5mm) inside amphibole or as
euhedral crystals (0.25-1mm) when
associated with plagioclase. The grains of
calco-sodic feldspar (labradorite-bytownite)
are usually subhedral and variable in size:
crystals inside hornblende are small, from
0.25mm to 0.5mm with round edges, while
outside they may be up to 2mm long. Apatite
constitutes anhedral grains, although
sometimes elongated, reaching 0.5mm. The
opaque grains have usually round contours and
small dimensions, and are mainly included in
amphibole. Comparatively with the others
lithologies, the mafic rocks exhibit more often
the development of secondary minerals, namely
growth of sericite, inside plagioclase, and
actinolite, at hornblende and pyroxene
expenses.

Conclusions

The Hospitais Massif is a Variscan syn-
tectonic plutonic body that comprises
medium-grained tonalites with
leucotonalitic layers and microgranular
enclaves. These enclaves have typical
igneous compositions and are sometimes
surrounded by hololeucocratic halos.
Outside this massif, but in the same sector
of the Évora High-Grade Metamorphic
Terrains, several minor gabbroic syn-
tectonic intrusions can be found. This

spatial and chronological association
suggests that the gabbros, the mafic
enclaves and the different tonalitic facies
may represent the primitive and
intermediate terms of a cogenetic igneous
suite, as will be discussed in the companion
paper (Moita et al., this volume), formed
during the Variscan orogeny.

The tonalites present magmatic fabrics
associated with a moderately developed
foliation, recording syntectonic
crystallization and cooling, co-planar to
steep foliations observed within the
surrounding sheared gneisses and
migmatites. Locally, it is possible to
observe LTL commonly parallel or slightly
oblique to the foliation with internal fabric
defined by the alignment of undeformed
grains of mafic minerals.

The enclaves display well-rounded
outlines, ellipsoidal forms (with maximum
axes sub-parallel to the foliation of
tonalites) and sharp limits. These structural
characteristics suggest that they were
formed when the crystallization of the
magma was not complete, but then they
were affected by strain in a progressive
deformation process. In fact, the fabric
displayed by tonalites seems to be of
magmatic origin and controlled by regional
deformation since some microstructures
developed on feldspars, biotite and quartz
are possible to observe.

In some places, there are discordant
LTL with an internal foliation oblique to the
foliation of the main tonalite, implying that,
at some point during the crystallization of
the tonalite, tensional stress-originated
fractures immediately replenished with the
remaining magma, after which shearing
continued to deform both lithologies.

Field relationships reveal that
crystallization and cooling of the main
tonalites and gabbros are synchronous with

progressive shearing of the gneisses and
migmatites envelope, with both intrusion
and country rock showing steep fabrics sub-
parallel to regional Variscan structures.
