Resumo
Introdução: Capacidade de preenchimento da cavidade retrógrada e porosidade são propriedades importantes 
de materiais retrobturadores e podem ser avaliadas por meio de microtomografia computadorizada (micro-CT).  
Objetivo: Avaliar a capacidade de preenchimento e porosidade de materiais retrobturadores por meio de micro-CT. 
Material e método: Cavidades com 1 mm de diâmetro e 3 mm de altura foram preparadas em dentina bovina 
utilizando pontas ultrassônicas (CVD No. 6.1107-6) e foram preenchidas com Mineral Trióxido Agregado (MTA), 
Sealer 26 (S26) e cimento de óxido de zinco e eugenol (OZE). As cavidades foram escaneadas em micro-CT antes 
e após o preenchimento. A capacidade de preenchimento foi calculada com base na porcentagem em volume, das 
cavidades preenchidas. O número e porcentagem dos poros fechados foram avaliados em toda extensão da cavidade 
preenchida (total) e por terços (cervical, médio e apical) por meio de análises bi e tridimensionais. Os dados de 
preenchimento foram submetidos aos testes estatísticos ANOVA e Tukey e a porosidade aos testes de Kruskall-Wallis e 
Dunn, com nível de significância de 5%.  Resultado: S26 e OZE apresentaram maior capacidade de preenchimento que 
o MTA (p&lt;0,05). S26 mostrou maior porosidade total (em número e porcentagem) (p&lt;0,05). Em todos os terços, após 
as análises 2D e 3D, a porosidade foi maior para S26 em comparação ao MTA e OZE (p&lt;0,05).  Conclusão: Embora 
Sealer 26 tenha apresentado maior porosidade, o material foi associado a uma adequada capacidade de preenchimento. 
A análise em micro-CT mostrou ausência de correlação entre capacidade de preenchimento e porosidade.

Abstract
Introduction: Filling ability of retrograde cavity and porosity are important properties for root-end filling materials 
and may be evaluated by using microcomputed tomography (micro-CT).  Objective: To evaluate filling ability and 
porosity of root-end filling materials using microcomputed tomography (micro-CT).  Material and method: Cavities 
with 1 mm internal diameter and 3 mm depth were prepared in bovine dentin sections by using ultrasonic tips 
(CVD No. 6.1107-6), and filled by Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA); Sealer 26 (S26) and zinc oxide and eugenol 
cement (ZOE). Before and after filling, cavities were scanned by using micro-CT (SkyScan 1176). Filling and porosity 
were analyzed by using CTAn software. Filling ability was calculated based on volumetric percentage of the filled cavity. 
The number and percentage of closed pores were measured throughout entire extension of the filled cavity (total) and 
in each third (cervical, middle and apical), by using bi and tridimensional analyses. The filling data were submitted 
to ANOVA and Tukey statistical tests, and porosity data to Kruskall-Wallis and Dunn tests, at a 5% significance level.  
Result: S26 and ZOE presented higher filling ability than MTA (p&lt;0.05). S26 showed the highest total porosity (number 
and percentage) (p&lt;0.05). In all thirds after 2D and 3D analyses, porosity was higher for S26 in comparison to MTA 
and ZOE (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: Although Sealer 26 presented more porosity, the material was associated with a great 
filling ability. Micro-CT analysis showed no correlation between filling ability and porosity.

INTRODUCTION

Microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) is a non-destructive 
tool used for different studies in Endodontics as analysis of root 
canal filling1, filling ability of the reparative materials2 and the 
evaluation of interface material/dentin associated with different 

root canal filling techniques and materials3. Micro-CT is also used 
for evaluating the volumetric change in endodontic materials, with 
possible correlation with solubility4 and dimensional change after 
immersion in distilled water2.

The porosity of a material may be affected by physicochemical 
properties. Cements with absence of macropores and lower porosity 
may present less penetration of oral fluids, bacteria and bacterial 
toxins into root canal5. Pores in sealers appear to be originated from 
the air trapped in the mass of cement during handling manipulation6. 
Porosity may be analyzed by means of microscopy, using porosimetry 
by mercury intrusion7, or by using microcomputed tomography8,9. 
De Souza et al.10, using a 3D model, quantitatively evaluated the 
degree of porosity of calcium-silicate based materials analyzing 
the images obtained by microcomputed tomography. 3D models 
were evaluated and the porosity parameters of each material 
were obtained by comparison with standard porosity values of 
Biodentine®. This tool allows a tridimensional mensuration (with 
volumetric results – mm3) of failures. Surface area, volumetric 
analysis, the amount of pores and specific characteristics of these 
structures can be assessed.

Clinically, these physical properties of root-end filling materials 
are relevant. High porosity values for endodontic materials may 
affects its physical properties7, besides increasing the leakage5. 
A better sealing can be obtained using a material presenting low 
disintegration and solubility11 and it may be directly related to 
leakage12. Also, proper sealing may be related to complete filling 
of the cavity. Analyzing physicochemical (i.e solubility, pH, filling 
ability) and biological (i.e biocompatibility, bioactivity) characteristics 
to the root-end filling material may improve the success of the 
treatment2,4,7,12.

Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) is a biocompatible calcium 
silicate-based material with capacity to induce repair by mineralized 
tissue13. However, the fluid consistency makes it difficult to insert 
MTA into the root-end cavity, and can harm filling and sealing14. 
Sealer 26 (S26) is a resin-based endodontic sealer, composed of 
bismuth oxide, calcium hydroxide and epoxy resin, and requires 
higher powder/resin proportion to favor insertion into root-end 
cavities13. It has excellent sealing properties when used as root-
end filling material15, and presents interface adaptation similar to 
calcium silicate-based cements16. Zinc oxide and Eugenol cement 
(ZOE) may also be used with higher powder/liquid proportion17, 
favoring its insertion into root-end cavities.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the filling ability and 
porosity of root-end filling materials by using microcomputed 
tomography. The null hypothesis was that there is no difference 
between the materials, and the properties of porosity and filling 
ability are associated.

MATERIAL AND METHOD

Sample Preparation

Bovine teeth were used in this study. The coronal portion was 
removed. The root portion was sectioned into 5mm slices, using 
an Isomet 1000 (Buehler Ltd., Lake Bluff, IL, USA) machine. 
On dentine surface of each slice, root-end cavities with standardized 
dimensions (1.5 mm diameter and 3 mm deep) were prepared 
by making intermittent forward-backward movements18 using a 
high-speed 2137 bur (KG SORENSEN, Cotia, SP, Brazil). Ultrasonic 
tip CVD No 6.1107-6 (CVD-Vale, São José dos Campos/SP, Brazil) 
coupled to an ultrasonic device CVDentus (CVD-Vale, São José 

dos Campos/SP, Brazil) was used on the dentinal walls. In order 
to maintain the same position during the scans, the samples were 
fixed in culture plates with silicone. Each well of the culture plate 
was filled with a standard amount of silicone and the samples were 
placed into this material, at all stages.

Sample Scanning

After cavity preparation, samples with empty cavities were 
subjected to microtomographic scannings (Micro-CT SkyScan 1176, 
Bruker micro-CT Kontich, Belgium). The scanning procedure was 
performed with 50 kV X-ray tube voltages and 800 µA anode current; 
aluminum filter of 0.5; isotropic voxel of 9 µm; and an evolution 
cycle of 360°. To standardize the position of samples, specimens 
were fixed in culture plates with silicone, as already described.

Filling Ability

The prepared cavities were then randomly divided into three 
groups, according to the material. MTA Angelus (Angelus, Londrina, 
PR, Brazil) was manipulated by a same operator previously calibrated 
using powder/liquid proportion of 1g/330µL. S26 (Dentsply, 
Petropolis, RJ, Brazil) was prepared in a thicker consistency than 
used as endodontic sealer, in a 4:1 powder/resin proportion (14). 
ZOE cement (S.S.White Art. Dent. Ltda., Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil) 
was used in the proportion of 1 g zinc oxide to 0.2 mL eugenol. 
The cavities were filled with the materials by using a condenser 
(Trinity, São Paulo, SP, Brazil). Samples were maintained at 37ºC 
and 100% humidity for three times the material setting time. 
After this period, each filled sample was subjected to another 
microtomographic scanning, as previously described.

Filling Ability Analysis

The scanned images were reconstructed by using NRecon 
software (V1.6.4,7; SkyScan, Belgium). The correction parameters 
smoothing, beam hardening and ring artefacts were carefully adjusted 
and maintained for all the periods, using values of 7, 20% and 10, 
respectively. These image parameters were used for all materials, 
to standardize the analysis process (scanning, reconstruction and 
analyzing criteria). After reconstruction, images were analyzed by 
using CTAn software (V1.11.8; SkyScan, Belgium). To obtain the total 
volume of material in mm3, the area of interest the region of interest 
(ROI) was defined by previous tests and a calibrated operator made 
all the analyzes of each sample, excluding the dentin. The binary 
value (threshold) was adjusted to assure the analysis of the material 
and the total volume of the material in mm3 from quantitative 
analysis was obtained. Filling was determined by calculating the 
subtracting the initial (empty cavities) from the final (filled cavities) 
assessed volume of each sample. The results were then converted 
into percentages based on the initial volume. 3D models from 
each specimen were carefully obtained by using CTVol software 
(V2.0, SkyScan, Belgium) to analyze qualitatively the data.

Porosity Analysis

Micro-CT proved to be a powerful nondestructive 3D analysis 
tool for visualizing the porous internal microstructure3. So, at this 
stage, the filled cavities were analyzed by means of CTAn software 



 Tanomaru-Filho, Espir, Nogueira et al. Rev Odontol UNESP. 2017 Nov-Dec; 46(6): 362-367364

(V1.11.8; SkyScan, Belgium). The porosity parameters for each 
sample were measured and number and percentage of closed 
pores were obtained. Total porosity throughout the entire material 
extent was determined. The limits of each sample were defined by 
using the “top” and “bottom” tool (Figure 1A). A circular VOI, 
measuring average 0.75 x 0.75, was determined to each analyzes 
to exclude any possible artefact related to the sample border. 
Thus, approximately 1 mm2 of margin was excluded. The internal 
portion of the materials was analyzed by the difference in radiopacity. 
After this, using the software’s porosity tool, the bidimensional 
total porosity values were obtained, according to number and 
percentage of closed pores. This feature allows porosity analysis 
for individual objects in 2D (bidimensional). It has been defined 
as the area of any spaces fully surrounded by solid, as a percent 
of the area of solid plus closed pores. Subsequently, by using the 
3D (tridimensional) analysis tool, the number and percentage 
of closed pores were obtained by means of tridimensional data, 
providing volumetric data. In this case, a closed pore in 3D is a 
connected assemblage of space voxels that is fully surrounded 
on all sides in 3D by solid voxels. In addition a tridimensional 
model of the samples was obtained by using the CTVol software 
(V2.0, SkyScan, Belgium).

To obtain more precise and specific analysis, sections with 
smaller thickness were also analyzed. The “top” and “bottom” tool 

was used to define 0.5mm sections to evaluate the porosity in the 
different cavity thirds: coronal, middle and apical (Figure  1B). 
The analysis was performed as previously described. For each third, 
the number and percentage of closed pores were calculated, and 
3D models were obtained.

Data from filling analysis were submitted to ANOVA and the 
Tukey tests, with 5% significance. Porosity data were submitted to 
the Kruskall-Wallis test, complemented by the Dunn test, with a 
level of significance of 5%.

RESULT

Filling Ability

Data obtained for filling volumetric analysis are represented 
in Table  1. Similar filling ability was observed for S26 and ZOE 
(p&gt;0.05), and both presented higher values than MTA (p&lt;0.05). 
3D model analyses (Figure 2) show similar characteristics for S26 
and ZOE, in comparison with MTA.

Porosity

The data obtained for porosity are described in Table  2. 
2D and 3D analyses presented similar patterns of comparison 
among the materials. S26 showed higher values for number and 
percentage of closed pores considering the total extent or each 
third analysis (p&lt;0.05). MTA and ZOE cement were similar for all 
the analyses (p&gt;0.05). Considering absolute values for both tests, 
the bidimensional analysis showed higher values in percentage 
and lower values for number of pores, while the tridimensional 
analysis revealed higher number of pores and a lower percentage. 
3D models porosity models for each third were obtained (Figure 3). 
The higher porosity observed to S26 was clearly observed in the 
qualitative analysis in comparison with MTA and ZOE, in all 
thirds evaluated.

DISCUSSION

Micro-CT volumetric analysis shows that S26 and ZOE cement 
presented greater filling ability than MTA. The larger powder to 
resin/liquid used to manipulate S26 and ZOE cement made it 
possible to increase their consistency, favoring their insertion 
into the root-end cavity. By using microcomputed tomography, 
Cavenago  et  al.4 evaluated the solubility of MTA with different 
powder-liquid ratio (4:1, 3:1 and 2:1) before and after immersion 
in water for 7 days. They observed that the material manipulated 
with larger quantity of water promoted greater change in volume. 
Therefore, the difficulty with inserting MTA into the cavity13 
cannot be improved by changing the powder/liquid proportion. 

For this reason, a better fill can be achieved using materials which 
allow changes in handling, facilitating insertion into the cavity 
(i.e. S26 and ZOE cement).

Proper cavity filling with a material presenting low disintegration 
and solubility may allow a better sealing. Favorable sealing ability 
for some materials may be related to its dimensional stability and 
filling, which led to less leakage11. Chittoni et al.12 observed lower 
bacterial leakage for Sealer 26 in comparison with MTA. Sealer 26 has 
also demonstrated to prevent bacterial leakage when compared 
with IRM15. Amoroso-Silva  et  al.16 demonstrated that Sealer 26, 
MTA and calcium silicate cements were similar after analyzing 
sealing by fluid leakage and dentinal adaptation. In the present 
study, similar filling ability was observed for S26 and ZOE, and 
both presented higher values than MTA. Torres  et  al.2 observed 
that ZOE presented better filling ability than MTA. Dias  et  al.19 
observed that the modification of a composite resin with small 
amounts of zinc oxide (ZnO) microparticles significantly inhibited 
the S. mutans growth on resin surface without significant alterations 
of its mechanical strength. This filling capacity may be related to the 
better consistency. The results obtained may suggest this relationship. 
S26 and ZOE cement presented similar characteristics of filling 
compared to MTA. The presence of space at the interface of the 
filling material and the root canal wall can result from deficient 
adaptation of the filling material to the root dentin20. Despite the 
excellent properties of MTA, the condensation technique may have 
some influence in its sealing ability.

Porosity analysis aims to measure the “failure fraction” and empty 
spaces, counting the spaces and characterizing their connections. 
The closed pores represent empty spaces completely surrounded 
by material, which is difficult to be analyzed by conventional 
methodologies. The use of microcomputed tomography allows

evaluation of these faults10. Microtomography has been used to 
evaluate the porosity of different materials8,9. Kerckhofs  et  al.8 
aiming to validate micro-CT as an imaging tool for analysis of 
pores, pointed out errors inherent to the analyses that may result 
in an incorrect interpretation. Artifacts might influence the quality 
of the images, challenging image analyses, once the images are 
reconstructed with several independent detector measurements21. 
As an example, streaking artefacts, which happen generally due to 
an inconsistency in a single measurement; ring artefacts, which 
appear due to errors in an individual detector calibration, distortion 
artefacts, due to the geometry of image reconstruction. In order to 
minimize these errors, all reconstructions were performed using 
the artifact reduction tools. De Souza et al.10 proposed a standard 
to obtain the threshold, using known values for the porosity of 
each material. Therefore, the use of microcomputed tomography 
for porosity analysis also presents variations that must suggest 
patterns based on the experiment performed and type of sample.

According to the manufacturer (Bruker-microCT, Kontich, 
Belgium), the CTAn software allows the analysis of porosity of 
any type of material. In this study, samples were scanned at a 
high resolution (9um), considered proper for quantifying pores22. 
During the reconstruction of images, standardized parameters were 
used in order to decrease artefacts. Analysis of the total sample 
extent presented more difficulty with defining the parameters, 
especially the histogram. Therefore, analysis of smaller sections 
(or thirds) is considered important for correct analysis.

As regards the results of this study, the two measurement analyses 
showed greater porosity for S26 in comparison with MTA and 
ZOE cement, for both number and percentage of pores. However, 
the 2D analyses showed higher percentage values, while the 3D 
presented a higher number of pores. In microscopic 2D images, a 

failure may appear as a closed pore, while in the 3D evaluation this 
pore is considered connected to the external space, which is one 
advantage of 3D analysis in comparison with conventional methods. 
Therefore, 3D analysis is indicated for this type of porosity analysis. 
Bidimensional analysis was evaluated to obtain complementary data. 
In the present study, bidimensional and tridimensional analysis 
presented correlated results for material porosities.

The analysis of porosity did not show correlation with filling 
data, since S26 and ZOE cement promoted greater filling. Otherwise, 
more porosity was observed for S26 when compared with MTA and 
ZOE cement, rejecting the null hypothesis. The immediate porosity 
(after the material set) is related to the material composition and 
hydration mechanism, especially to water/powder proportion for 
MTA23. MTA has demonstrated porosity in different formulations, 
especially after long evaluation periods3. The low porosity observed 
for MTA in the present study may be related to the different 
methodologies and analysis performed immediately after cavity 
filling. Mutal, Gani6, after a qualitative analysis of pores in endodontic 
sealers, including zinc oxide and eugenol cements and Sealer 26, 
observed that the frequency and size of pores were related to the 
consistency of the material, and was increased for sealers with 
calcium hydroxide, such as Sealer 26.

CONCLUSION

Based on the methodology used and the results obtained, we 
could conclude that Sealer 26 and ZOE cement showed better filling 
ability in comparison to MTA. On the other hand, Sealer 26 presented 
porosity higher in number and percentage than MTA and zinc 
oxide and eugenol.
