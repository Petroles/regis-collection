Sociocognitive performance in autism spectrum disorders 

and interference of the therapeutic environment

Desempenho sociocognitivo nos Transtornos do Espectro do 

Autismo e interferência do ambiente terapêutico 

ABSTRACT

Purpose: To analyze the sociocognitive performance of children and adolescents with autism spectrum 

disorders in two environments of language therapy, which differ as to the physical structure. Methods: Ten 

children and adolescents with ages between 4 and 13 years, of both genders, diagnosed with autism spectrum 

disorders took part in the study. For data collection, eight filming sessions were performed during individual 

language therapy lasting 30 minutes, being four in a room with conventional environmental organization 

(common room) and four in a room with specific ambiance [children’s interaction core (CIC) room], 

interspersed during a month. For the analysis of filmed situations, the Sociocognitive Performance Protocol 

was used and obtained data were subjected to statistical analysis. Results: No statistical significance was found 

in sociocognitive performance of 10 subjects in the common and CIC rooms, although specific differences 

were observed in some cases. Conclusion: The creation of preestablished physical environments or specific 

materials is not and should not be considered essential for language therapy. It is noteworthy, however, that the 

absence of a large volume of statistically significant data does not indicate that the results are not expressive, 

reiterating the need for further research in the area.

RESUMO

Objetivo: Analisar o desempenho sociocognitivo de crianças e adolescentes com Transtornos do Espectro 

do Autismo em dois ambientes de terapia de linguagem, que se diferenciam quanto à estruturação do aspecto 

físico. Métodos: Participaram dez crianças e adolescentes com a faixa etária entre 4 e 13 anos, de ambos 

os gêneros, com diagnósticos estabelecidos entre os Transtornos do Espectro do Autismo. Para a coleta de 

dados, foram realizadas oito filmagens durante sessões de terapia de linguagem individual com duração de 30 

minutos, sendo quatro em sala com organização ambiental convencional (sala comum) e quatro em sala com 

ambientação específica (sala NIC), intercaladamente, durante um mês. Para a análise das situações filmadas, foi 

utilizado o Protocolo de Desempenho Sociocognitivo e os dados obtidos foram submetidos à análise estatística. 

Resultados: Verificou-se que não houve significância estatística no desempenho sociocognitivo dos dez 

sujeitos na sala comum e na sala NIC, embora tenham sido observadas diferenças específicas em alguns casos. 

Conclusão: A criação de ambientes físicos preestabelecidos ou materiais específicos não são e não devem ser 

considerados imprescindíveis para a terapia de linguagem. Ressalta-se, no entanto, que a ausência de um grande 

volume de dados estatisticamente significativos não indica que os resultados não sejam expressivos, reiterando 

a necessidade de novas pesquisas na área.

403Sociocognitve performance and autism

CoDAS 2014;26(5):402-6

INTRODUCTION

The sociocognitive aspects of children and adolescents 
with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are described in 
literature as essential for language development(1-6) and 
speech therapy acting(2,3,5).

In the development process of children, there is a small 
relation between the cognitive, affective, social, and com-
municative areas, which are the foundations for symbol 
emergency(2). The social and affective deficits in the ASD 
are associated with cognitive damage that leads to a poor 
development in the game, therefore the child does not have 
appropriate emotional and cultural cycles for a typical 
development(3). For the speech therapy practice, knowl-
edge on the existent variations in the relations between 
the areas is extremely important in the intervention pro-
cess, because it shows that peculiarities of the delays in 
language development may be analyzed under different 
perspectives(2).

Another aspect that should be considered in speech 
therapy interventions is related to the variables concern-
ing the environmental context of language therapy(7-10). 
Several researchers, based on a pragmatic perspective of 
the language, pointed out the importance of the context 
for communication(7,8).

The context in which communication occurs is com-
plex and includes multidimensional aspects; therefore, its 
analysis is very important to investigate characteristics 
associated with communication(11) such as the sociocog-
nitive performance. For subjects with ASD, development 
can be favored in environments that are comprehensive and 
make its evolution easier and can be adjusted to its limita-
tions(10), and they can possibly be significantly modified 
from one context to another(12).

Furthermore, literature mentions the importance that 
environmental context has on aspects such as behavior, 
attention, and expressive language in subjects with ASD(13-15).

Thus, scientific investigations are required on the lan-
guage and cognitive aspects in the subjects with ASD, 
which take into consideration the different context ele-
ments that may interfere in the development of children 
with ASD(7,8). Thus, the objective of this study was to ana-
lyze the sociocognitive performance of children and ado-
lescents with ASD in two language therapy environments, 
which differ as to the physical structure.

The hypothesis that led us to carry out this study was 
the result of theoretical referential associated with clinical 
exercise showing that children with ASD might present a 
better communication performance in an environment that 
is structured, functional, and familiar to the child than in 
a conventional room of speech therapy.

METHODS

This research was approved by the research ethics com-
mittee of Faculdade de Filosofia e Ciências of Universidade 

Estadual Paulista “Júlio de Mesquita Filho” (UNESP), Marília 
Campus, under protocol number 968/2003. All people in 
charge for the participants signed the free informed consent 
according to resolution 196/96 of the Brazilian National 
Health Counsel (NHC).

Subjects

Te n  c h i l d r e n  a n d  a d o l e s c e n t s  a g e d  4 – 1 3  y e a r s 
(mean  =   7.9  years) were included in this research, six 
male and four female. All of them were diagnosed with 
ASD, and diagnoses were performed by a psychiatry fol-
lowing specific criteria(16,17). Subjects were going through 
a speech therapeutic process during a period from 1 to 
6 years, and the following criteria were not considered as 
exclusion characteristics: age, sex, education, use of ver-
bal or nonverbal communication, and IQ.

Chart 1 presents data concerning age, sex, and speech ther-
apy period of each subject.

Data were collected at the end of the school year of the 
fourth-year therapists; thus, children were receiving treatment 
with the same therapist for a period of around 9 months.

Procedures

Data were collected inside the Health and Education Study 
Center (CEES) of Faculdade de Filosofia e Ciências of UNESP, 
Marília Campus.

This is a cross-sectional study, in which filming sessions 
happened in two rooms called common room and children’s 
interaction core (CIC) room, with different physical structures. 
The common room presented a conventional environmental 
organization generally used in speech therapy, measuring 9 m2 
including table, chairs, cabinet, small mattress, and toys that 
were available inside a cabinet for each subject to use. However, 
the CIC room measured around 30 m2 and had furniture adapted 
for small children and for its respective environment, such as 
kitchen (sink, stove, microwave stove, fridge, and table), liv-
ing room (armchair and table), bedroom (wardrobe, dressing 
table, bed, cradle, and dolls), and other toys with the aim of 
representing a copy of the house.

In both rooms, there were also miniatures of domestic 
appliances, means of transportation, animals, telephone, plastic 
fruits, stroller and supermarket trolley, iron, doll clothes, doll, 
ball, beauty salon toys (comb, brush, hair dryer, mirror, 
and make-up), magazines, paper, and pencil.

In the common room, toys were available inside the 
cabinet so that the child could use them. In the beginning 
of every session, the therapist opened the cabinet and the 
child chose the toys he/she would like to get. The child 
was free to request or open the cabinet to catch other toys 
throughout the speech therapy session.

In the CIC room, toys were exposed according to their 
functionality and they were at children’s disposal. In both 
situations, therapists were requested to establish a free 
game situation, providing interaction, according to the 
interests shown by the child.

All subjects had been previously cared in two routine 
sessions, in both rooms. Thus, they were acquainted with 
these ambiances.

For data collection, filming equipment to record the 
speech therapy sessions was used.

Eight filming sessions of individual language therapy 
were recorded for each subject with ASD, during a 1-month 
period, and four of them were carried out in the common 
room and four in the CIC room, interposed. Initially, the 
filming session were done in the CIC room with all partic-
ipants, following the order: CIC room/common room for 
data collection. Thus, 80 filming sessions were performed: 
40 ones lasting 30 minutes in each room, totalizing 2,400 
minutes or 40 hours of observation.

To analyze sociocognitive performance of children 
with ASD during the filmed situations, the Sociocognitive 
Performance Protocol(18) was used. In the analysis using 
such protocol, collected data were registered with numbers 
according to the best performance of each child in every 
area analyzed in the protocol: 
1. gestural communicative intention, 
2. vocal communicative intention, 
3. use of mediator object, 
4. gestural imitation, 
5. vocal imitation, 
6. combinatory game, and 
7. symbolic game.

Each area presents a minimum and a maximum score 
for classification according to child’s performance. The 
gestural communicative intention, vocal communicative 
intention, combinatory game, and symbolic game areas pre-
sented scores that varied from one to six, that is, the higher 
the grade is, the better is the performance in that area. In 
the gestural imitation, vocal imitation, and use of mediator 
object areas, the scores ranged from one to four, in which 
the highest classification corresponds to the best perfor-
mance. All data were analyzed and transcribed and, later, 
the interobserver concordance index verification was carried 
out. The two judges were speech therapists graduated and 

experienced in infantile psychiatry and equivalent experi-
ence in using the analysis instrument. Therefore, eight film-
ing situations were sorted so that each judge could analyze 
them, four in the CIC room and four in the common room. 
To calculate the concordance between judges and the first 
author researcher of this study about the sociocognitive 
aspects, the following mathematical formula was used: 
(100-|n1 - n2|/n maximum)x100. The concordance between 
judges and the researcher was of 99.97%.

For the analysis of results, the best performance of each 
subject in every studied room was considered. From these 
data, the statistical analysis was carried out using Student’s 
t-test to compare results concerning the sociocognitive per-
formance in every room. The 5% significance level (p&lt;0.05) 
was used to apply the statistical test.

RESULTS

Table 1 presents the score of the best performances in the 
gestural communicative intention (GCI), vocal communicative 
intention (VCI), use of the mediator object (UMO), gestural 
imitation (GI), vocal imitation (VI), combinatory game (CG), 
and symbolic game (SG) during the eight sessions, in the com-
mon and CIC rooms, respectively.

Table 2 shows the scores summary of the sociocognitive 
performance of the subjects with ASD in the common and CIC 
rooms through means and standard deviation of scores obtained 
from the Sociocognitive Performance Protocol. Besides, it 
also presents results related to the comparative analysis of the 
sociocognitive performance of 10 subjects in the common and 
CIC rooms.

It was also seen, after applying the Student’s t-test for paired 
data, that there was no significant difference in the sociocog-
nitive performance of 10 subjects in the common and CIC 
rooms (Table 2).

Furthermore, it should be mentioned that no significant dif-
ferences were seen concerning therapy duration and age of the 
participants’ variables.

DISCUSSION

Although results have showed that the difference seen in the 
sociocognitive performance of the subjects with ASD, when 
both rooms were compared with different kinds of physical 
organization of the environment, was not statistically signifi-
cant, it should be pointed out that only the best sociocognitive 
performances of each participant were considered. These find-
ings are in agreement with those seen by other authors who 
also mentioned that the subjects with ASD may present simi-
lar sociocognitive performance in the different communicative 
situations studied(2).

In the gestural communicative intention area, most individ-
uals presented similar performance in both rooms; therefore, 
this aspect did not present a variation due to the environment 
context. A study(18) spontaneously and directly performed also 
could not find a difference in this area, probably because the 
child would not need to make use of gestures to get the toy, 
because there were several toys at his/her disposal.

In addition, it was seen that 70% of the subjects had similar 
performance in the vocal communicative intention in the com-
mon and CIC rooms, therefore the context did not interfere in 
this aspect. However, a study(18) states that when the child has 
verbal language, he/she will probably use it in any moment 
during the 30 minutes of the filming session, indicating that 
such aspect may happen regardless of the environment context.

No mediator object was used in 30% of the subjects, and 
the worst performance was seen in 40% of the subjects in the 
common and CIC rooms, being the best one in 20% in the CIC 
room. Only 4% of the subjects presented better performance in 
the common room. These data confirm the findings of a study(19) 

that emphasized the worst performance of this aspect in spon-
taneous communicative situations.

As to the combinatory game, most subjects (70%) presented 
similar performance in the two studied rooms. These data can be 
compared to the findings of a study(18) showing that the sponta-
neous situation favors the appearance of a combinatory game.

Of the 10 studied subjects, 60% presented similar perfor-
mance in the symbolic game in both rooms, and the others (40%) 
had better performance in the CIC room. A study(18) indicates 
that the subjects with ASD showed better performance for the 
symbolic game in the test situation than in the spontaneous one. 
In this study, the CIC room seems to favor the appearance of 
the symbolic game because materials were exposed according 
to their functionality and were at children’s reach.

It should be mentioned that a higher number of subjects 
presented better performance in the CIC room compared to 
the vocal imitation (60% of the subjects). Half of them (50% 
of the subjects) for the gestural imitation area, only 20% of the 
subjects achieved better performance in the common room and 
30% presented similar performance in the two rooms, as shown 
in Table 1. These data confirm the statement(20) that physical 
contexts such as tables and chairs tend to provide less possi-
bilities of gesture expression than large environments such as 
the CIC room.

According to other authors(10,21), different contexts in situ-
ations of individual speech therapy for the subjects with ASD 
imply differences of performance, but such changes are also 
related to time and interference of several speakers and not only 
to the context. Regardless of the physical environment and of 
the adopted therapeutic proposal, the speech therapist will be 
in charge of process distinction acting like an ideal speaker and 
a mediator of the therapeutic process(7).

When analyzing individual tendencies, there were some 
characteristics that are in agreement with those of the other 
authors(2,3,5) who saw heterogeneity in the sociocognitive per-
formance of the subjects with ASD. It is important to explore 
individual differences because they are associated with diag-
nosis and prognosis of language and interaction of the children 
with ASD, besides they help creating strategies of interventions 
more directed to the needs of each case(22).

Sociocognitive performance can be used as a support instru-
ment in the therapeutic process, making the identification of 
variables that may interfere in the communicative performance 
easier(2). Thus, the study on sociocognitive aspects of the sub-
jects with ASD can offer subsidies to prepare and use new 
techniques and procedures that favor the communicative pro-
cess efficiently(2,3).

Data presented herein suggest the need of new researches 
such as longitudinal studies about the interference of the physi-
cal context, to better clarify the possible interferences related 
to the sociocognitive performance of the subjects with ASD in 
different ambiances of language therapy.

in language therapy situations allowed verifying that the dif-
ference seen in the room with conventional structure applied 
in speech therapy clinics and in that with specific environment 
was not statistically significant.

Thus, the creation of preestablished physical environments 
or specific materials is not and should not be considered essen-
tial for language therapy. It is noteworthy, however, that the 
absence of a large volume of statistically significant data does 
not indicate that the results are not expressive, reiterating the 
need for further research in the area.
