Abstract 

 

 Bioenergetics of chemotrophic bacteria is based on substrate-level phosphorylation 

and electron transfer phosphorylation for energy conservation. Recently, a third mechanism 

of energy coupling named flavin-based electron bifurcation (FBEB) was proposed for 

anaerobic bacteria. Sulfate-reducing organisms (SRO) are a polyphyletic group of anaerobic 

microorganisms, which perform dissimilatory sulfate reduction. Interestingly, studies 

concerning SRO identified protein homologies to enzymes engaged in FBEB in 

methanogens, suggesting the presence of FBEB in sulfate reducers. Here we studied: i) the 

physiological role of a protein complex (HdrABC-FloxABCD) possibly involved in FBEB; and 

ii) the function of DsrD, a protein potentially involved in sulfite reduction, the last step of the 

dissimilatory sulfate reduction. 

 Firstly, phenotypic characterization of hdrC and floxA mutants in Desulfovibrio 

vulgaris Hildenborough with ethanol as electron donor revealed no cell growth, while a 

complemented strain of the floxA mutant grew similarly to the wild-type (WT). Then, under 

pyruvate fermentation conditions, both mutants produced low levels of ethanol comparing to 

the WT and complemented strain. Gene and protein expression analysis in WT strains 

cultured with different electron donors/acceptors showed upregulation of FloxA and HdrA 

when ethanol is the electron donor. Moreover, an alcohol dehydrogenase (adh1) gene 

present upstream of the hdr-flox cluster is also upregulated in the medium containing ethanol. 

Altogether, these results show that the HdrABC-FloxABCD complex is involved in the ethanol 

metabolism of D. vulgaris. 

 Secondly, the dsrD gene from D. vulgaris was cloned, overexpressed and the protein 

purified. Sulfite reduction activity and protein-protein interaction studies showed no direct 

biochemical role of DsrD in sulfite reduction. Then a dsrD deletion mutant was generated 

showing a long lag phase under sulfate reduction conditions when compared to the WT. This 

mutant did not grow with sulfite as electron acceptor, revealing the importance of dsrD in 

sulfite reduction, most likely at a regulatory level. 

 Overall, this work allowed a better understanding of energy conservation 

mechanisms in SRO, proposing a new mechanism for ethanol metabolism played by the 

FloxABCD-HdrABC complex and producing new insights into the function of DsrD in the 

dissimilatory sulfate reduction.

Resumo 

 

 Os sistemas bioenergéticos de bactérias quimiotróficas baseiam-se em dois 

mecanismos de conservação de energia: a fosforilação ao nível do substrato (FNS) e a 

fosforilação oxidativa (FO). A FO é também conhecida como respiração e envolve 

acoplamento quimiosmótico. Recentemente, um outro mecanismo de acoplamento 

energético, chamado bifurcação electrónica baseada em flavinas (BEBF), foi proposto para 

bactérias anaeróbias quimiotróficas. Este mecanismo é caracterizado por acoplar uma 

reacção termodinamicamente não favorável a uma reacção favorável e foi já 

experimentalmente demonstrado em organismos fermentativos, árqueas metanogénicas e 

bactérias acetogénicas. Os complexos proteicos envolvidos na BEBF são citoplasmáticos, 

contêm flavinas como cofactores (FMN ou FAD) e um dos aceitadores/dadores de electrões 

é normalmente uma ferredoxina (Fd). 

 Os organismos redutores de sulfato (ORS) são um grupo polifilético de 

microrganismos existentes em ambientes anaeróbios, tendo um metabolismo versátil. Os 

sulfato-redutores têm a capacidade de realizar a redução dissimilativa do sulfato, i.e., de 

reduzir grandes quantidades de sulfato como mecanismo de conservação de energia 

produzindo sulfureto, um produto tóxico do seu metabolismo. Deste modo estes organismos 

contribuem para o ciclo biogeoquímico do enxofre usando o sulfato como aceitador de 

electrões durante a degradação de matéria orgânica, produzindo sulfureto que pode ser 

oxidado por outros microrganismos. Pela capacidade que têm de utilizar diversos dadores e 

aceitadores de electrões, os ORS são usados em bio-remediação de metais tóxicos e 

compostos orgânicos como hidrocarbonetos; todavia estes organismos comportam 

igualmente um impacto negativo, nomeadamente contribuindo para a bio-corrosão de metais 

ferrosos e de betão e contribuindo ainda para a acidificação de reservas de petróleo. Apesar 

da importância ambiental destes microrganismos, os mecanismos de conservação de 

energia neste grupo permanecem por conhecer com clareza. Para estudos fisiológicos, 

genéticos e bioquímicos é normalmente utilizado o organismo modelo Desulfovibrio vulgaris 

Hildenborough, uma vez que é relativamente fácil e rápido de cultivar em laboratório, tendo 

sido o primeiro ORS a ter o seu genoma sequenciado. Estudos genómicos identificaram 

proteínas semelhantes à heterodilsulfureto redutases (Hdr) em ORS, especialmente 

proteínas homólogas à HdrA, a subunidade proteica que contém uma flavina como co-factor 

e que foi proposta ser responsável pela BEBF em árqueas metanogénicas. Este estudo 

sugere desta forma que o mecanismo de BEBF pode estar presente em procariotas sulfato-

redutores. 

 Assim sendo, o objectivo deste trabalho centra-se em contribuir para um maior e 

mais profundo conhecimento dos mecanismos de conservação de energia em sulfato-

redutores, estudando o papel fisiológico do complexo citoplasmático heterodisulfureto 

redutase-oxidase de flavina (HdrABC-FloxABCD), que se pensa estar envolvido em BEBF, e 

investigando a potencial função da proteína redutase dissimilativa de sulfito (DsrD) na via da 

redução dissimilativa do sulfato.

 Na primeira parte do trabalho experimental, estudou-se o papel fisiológico dos genes 

flox-hdr em D. vulgaris Hildenborough, usando duas estirpes mutantes: IPFG01, com uma 

cassete de resistência a canamicina inserida no gene hdrC, e IPFG02, uma estirpe em que o 

gene floxA foi substituído por uma cassete de resistência a canamicina por recombinação 

homóloga. A caracterização fenotípica das estirpes mutantes revelou que ambos os 

mutantes são incapazes de crescer quando o etanol é usado como dador de electrões para 

reduzir sulfato. Por outro lado uma estirpe mutante complementada com o gene floxA 

(IPFG03) cresceu de forma semelhante ao WT. Durante o crescimento fermentativo em 

piruvato, realizou-se a quantificação da concentração de etanol no meio extracelular através 

de um método enzimático. Este ensaio experimental revelou uma produção muito baixa de 

etanol por parte das estirpes mutantes IPFG01 e IPFG02, comparativamente às estirpes WT 

e IPFG03, indicando deste modo que em condições fermentativas de crescimento, as 

proteínas FloxABCD estão envolvidas na redução de NAD
+
 para produção de etanol. Foram 

adicionalmente realizados estudos de expressão génica ao nível do gene (por PCR 

quantitativo) e da proteína (por “Western blotting”) na estirpe selvagem (WT) em condições 

de cultura contendo diferentes dadores e aceitadores de electrões. Estes revelaram que os 

genes floxA e hdrA são sobre-expressos quando é usado etanol como dador de electrões, e 

o mesmo foi observado ao nível da expressão proteica. A montante dos genes hdr-flox está 

situado um gene que codifica para uma álcool desidrogenase (adh1) revelando igualmente 

uma sobre-expressão quando o etanol é usado como dador de electrões. Contudo a 

expressão do gene adh1 é consideravelmente superior à dos genes anteriormente referidos, 

indicando que os genes adh1 e hdr-flox não se encontram no mesmo operão. Esta diferença 

observada ao nível da expressão génica reflectiu-se na purificação das proteínas: enquanto 

que a proteína Adh1 foi facilmente purificada, o mesmo sucesso não foi obtido na purificação 

das proteínas Flox e Hdr devido à sua baixa expressão. Os resultados obtidos considerando 

esta parte do trabalho demonstram que as proteínas FloxABCD estão envolvidas no 

metabolismo do etanol em D. vulgaris. Propomos então que o complexo FloxABC-HdrABCD 

seja capaz de realizar BEBF acoplando a redução de Fd com NADH à redução da proteína 

DsrC igualmente com NADH. 

 Na segunda parte deste trabalho, o gene dsrD foi clonado, sobre-expresso em 

Escherichia coli e a proteína subsequentemente purificada por técnicas cromatográficas. O 

gene dsrD encontra-se situado imediatamente a jusante do gene dsrAB, fazendo ambos 

parte do mesmo operão. A redutase dissimilativa de sulfito (DsrAB) é, juntamente com a 

proteína DsrC, responsável pelo último passo da redução dissimilativa do sulfato. Tendo em 

conta a potencial importância da proteína DsrD na redução do sulfato, foram realizadas 

ensaios espectrofotométricos de actividade enzimática de redução do sulfito e testes de 

interação proteína-proteína (por Biacore) e proteína-ligando (por Calorimetria de Titulação 

Isotérmica) de modo a detectar interações entre a DsrD e DsrAB, DsrC e/ou sulfito. Apesar 

das diversas tentativas, não foram obtidos resultados positivos, levando-nos a crer que a 

proteína DsrD desempenha um papel regulatório em vez de um papel funcional directo na 

redução do sulfato. Um vez que a estrutura tridimensional da proteína foi já obtida e inclui um 



 viii 

domínio de ligação ao DNA, considera-se que a proteína DsrD desempenhe um papel 

regulatório in vivo. Durante este trabalho experimental foi construído um mutante de deleção 

por troca da sequência codificante para o gene dsrD com uma cassete de resistência a 

canamicina através de recombinação homóloga. Os estudos fenotípicos com esta nova 

estirpe revelaram uma longa fase de adaptação na curva de crescimento em meio de cultura 

contendo sulfato como aceitador de electrões, comparativamente com a estirpe WT. 

Pensamos que após a longa fase de adaptação as células adquirem espontaneamente 

mutações que lhes permitem adaptar-se ao meio contendo sulfato, demonstrando que o 

gene dsrD pode estar a regular os genes dsrAB afectando deste modo a via respiratória. 

Adicionalmente, a estirpe mutante não foi capaz de crescer em meio com sulfito como 

aceitador de electrões, o que revela que este gene é essencial para a redução do sulfito. 

 De uma forma geral, este trabalho contribuiu para uma melhor e mais profunda 

compreensão do modo como os organismos sulfato-redutores desempenham a conservação 

de energia, com especial interesse na nova via de conservação de energia, BEBF, que 

aparenta estar disseminada pelas bactérias quimiotróficas anaeróbias. Em perspectivas 

futuras seria ideal conseguir expressar e purificar o complexo FloxABCD-HdrABC de modo a 

analisar a BEBF in vitro. Adicionalmente, novas indicações foram obtidas no que toca a 

compreender qual a função ao nível fisiológico da proteína DsrD, envolvida na redução 

dissimilativa do sulfato. Em continuação deste projecto, seria interessante determinar a 

capacidade de interação da proteína DsrD com o DNA in vitro, analisar que genes 

substituem a função do gene dsrD, permitindo a adaptação da estirpe mutante ao meio de 

cultura contendo sulfato como aceitador de electrões, e ainda qual a contribuição desses 

mesmos genes para a via da redução dissimitativa do sulfato.

 1.1 – Energy conservation in anaerobic bacteria 
 

 Life requires energy. One of the features that distinguish living beings from inanimate 

objects is their metabolism. Metabolism balances energy through a set of chemical 

transformations occurring in two forms: anabolism, biosynthetic reactions requiring energy 

input; and catabolism, molecular breakdown reactions that allow to restore the cellular energy 

budget. The universal molecular currency of energy adopted by living beings is proton motive 

force, which is consumed for cellular processes and produced by energy conservation 

mechanisms. Additionally, there are two environmental sources for energy conservation: in 

chemotrophic organisms, energy derives from the oxidation of environmental electron donors, 

while in phototrophic organisms energy comes from sunlight (Figure 1.1). Chemotrophic 

organisms exist virtually since the dawn of life on Earth and have evolved to very distinct 

metabolic systems ever since.

 1.1.1 – Bioenergetic origins 

 At the time life is estimated to have emerged on Earth (about 4.6 billion years ago) 

our planet had quite different geological and atmospheric characteristics from the ones 

observed today. The prebiotic atmosphere was mainly composed of hydrogen, ammonia, 

methane, carbon dioxide, and water (2). In the 1920’s Aleksandr Oparin and John Haldane 

hypothesized that these compounds, combined with the strong UV radiation present at that 

time, led to the emergence of the first biomolecules in ocean waters. The combination of 

these molecules, along with the action of Natural Selection during millions and millions of 

years, formed the complex life forms we know of today. 

 Since the primordial atmosphere had no oxygen, the first living beings had to 

replicate and generate their own energy from an anaerobic environment. Energy was stored 

in the form of ATP, an energy-rich compound required for anabolic reactions and cell function; 

this biochemical signature has been conserved by nature thereafter and is still present among 

all living forms. In this regard, the first metabolism capable of sustaining life would use the 

compounds available in the primitive environment in order to generate energy for cellular 

biochemical reactions.  

 During the evolution of life, new metabolic machineries started to emerge. Despite 

the diversity of mechanisms, energy conservation in chemotrophs is thought to exist only via 

two different ways: substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP) and electron-transfer 

phosphorylation (ETP), also known as oxidative phosphorylation (1). In the first mechanism, 

energy-rich compounds form ATP by transferring a phosphoryl group to ADP in anaerobic 

conditions. The second mechanism (ETP) involves the formation of an electrochemical 

gradient (?pH for protons or ?pNa for sodium ions) across the cytoplasmic membrane 

generated by an electron transfer chain that reduces a terminal acceptor (3). The 

electrochemical gradient formed drives a cationic flow through ATP synthase, which causes 

subunits of this enzyme to rotate, leading to conformational changes in the active site, which 

culminates in the formation of ATP from ADP and Pi (4). Two major types of oxidative 

phosphorylation, also called respiration, emerged differing in the electron acceptors used. 

These respiratory organisms used both SLP and ETP pathways using a diverse range of 

electron donors/acceptors for energy conservation (Table 1.1). Anaerobic respiration 

emerged first, using reduced compounds such as sulfur or iron as electron acceptors. After 

the rise of atmospheric oxygen concentration caused by the metabolism of photosynthetic 

organisms, aerobic respiration emerged using oxygen as terminal electron acceptor. Since 

oxygen has a higher redox potential (E
0
’) than the electron acceptors used in anaerobic 

respiration it permits the release of more energy per oxidized molecule. 

 Although it is classically considered that fermentative organisms do not perform 

respiration, recent studies indicate that their energy conservation mechanisms may be more 

complex. There are several examples of an electrochemical gradient necessary for ATP 

synthesis being formed in the membrane of fermentative organisms, such as by electrogenic 

transport in lactic acid bacteria (5), electron transfer through energy-conserving 



 3 

hydrogenases in hyperthermophiles (6), and also by sodium-translocating NADH 

dehydrogenases in glutamate fermenting bacteria (7).

 1.1.2 – Flavin-based electron bifurcation – a new pathway for energy 
coupling 

 In recent years, a new mechanism of energy coupling named flavin-based electron 

bifurcation (FBEB) has been proposed (8, 9). This mechanism couples a thermodynamically 

unfavorable reaction (often the reduction of ferredoxin) to a favorable reaction. Reduced 

ferredoxin (Fd) then functions as an electron and energy carrier and its oxidation can be 

linked to energy conservation. At the base of FBEB is a stepwise electron transfer from a 

reduced flavin co-factor (FADH2) in which the low-potential electron is used for reduction of a 

high potential electron acceptor, while the second electron reduces Fd (Figure 1.2) (9). The 

reduction of low potential Fd is only possible since a lower redox potential flavin semiquinone 

(“hot flavosemiquinone”) is formed after the first electron is transferred to the high potential 

electron acceptor (10). The logic behind FBEB is similar to the Q-cycle proposed by Peter 

Mitchell, involving a quinone electron bifurcation at the bc1 complex (11). Energy conservation 



 4 

via reduced Fd occurs by either proton reduction to H2, increasing SLP in the oxidative branch 

of fermentation, or by generation of an electrochemical gradient via the Rnf membrane 

complex (8). The Rnf complex (for Rhodobacter nitrogen fixation) is a H
+
/Na

+
-pumping 

Fd:NAD
+ 

oxidoreductase found in many anaerobes (12). Since low redox potential Fd is 

required by autotrophs to reduce CO2, FBEB might have been important, if not essential, 

during early life evolution (13). 

 1.1.3 – FBEB examples 

 The FBEB mechanism was first observed in the Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium 

kluyveri (9), which is able to ferment ethanol and acetate to butyrate, caproate, and H2, a 

unique feature among clostridia (14). H2 formation was shown to be Fd-dependent, requiring 

acetyl-CoA for reduction of crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA. Also, H2 was formed by an 

endergonic reaction during fermentation from NADH. The work of Li et al. revealed that the 

cytoplasmic butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase/electron transfer complex (BcdA/EtfBC complex) 

was responsible for coupling Fd reduction with NADH to the reduction of crotonyl-CoA to 

butyryl-CoA with NADH (Figure 1.2) (9). Since this complex contains four FAD cofactors with 

no additional prosthetic groups this new energy conservation mechanism was named flavin-

based electron bifurcation. Other examples of FBEB enzymes are the NfnAB complex

Thermotoga maritima, which couples the oxidation of Fd and NADH to generate H2 (16).

In methanogens, the formation of methane from CO2 reduction with H2 is coupled to the 

formation of a heterodisulfide (CoM-S-S-CoB). The mechanism for heterodisulfide reduction 

is distinct in methanogens with cytochromes from methanogens without cytochromes (17). In 

methanogens with cytochromes VhoACG hydrogenase/HdrDE heterodisulfide reductase 

membrane complex couples H2 oxidation to heterodisulfide reduction and proton pumping 

(18). In methanogens without cytochromes the MvhADG hydrogenase/HdrABC 

heterodisulfide reductase cytoplasmic complex couples the reduction of Fd (unfavorable step) 

with H2 to the reduction of the heterodisulfide by H2 (favorable step) in a FBEB mechanism 

(Figure 1.3) (19). Interestingly, we can find HdrABC related proteins in non-methanogenic 

organisms in which the function of these proteins remains unsolved. The most evident of 

these Hdr-containing organisms are the sulfate-reducing organisms (SRO) group, whose 

energy metabolism remains incompletely understood. Surprisingly, these organisms contain 

several proteins similar to HdrA and HdrB/D (20, 21).

 In the sulfate reducer Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, a novel gene cluster 

includes the floxABCD (flavin oxidoreductase) genes, which code for a new NADH 

dehydrogenase and a set of hdrABC genes (Figure 1.4). The flox/hdr cluster is predicted to 

form an operon possibly involved in electron bifurcation from NADH. Additionally, this cluster 

is found in a great diversity of Bacteria, including members of different phyla such as 

Chlorobi, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, and Actinobacteria (20). It 

is proposed that the Flox proteins oxidize NADH via FloxA that will then transfer electrons to

 1.2 – Sulfate-Reducing Organisms (SRO) 
  

 There is geological evidence for the activity of SRO by 3.5 billion years ago (23). 

Since then, this polyphyletic group of microorganisms has been playing a critical role in the 

biogeochemical sulfur and carbon cycles. SRO live in anaerobic conditions such as marine 

sediments, fresh waters, soil and also in the mouth and gut of some animals, including 

humans. Due to the high concentration of sulfate in sea water (~28 mM) they are more 

abundant in marine environments and are responsible for 50 % of total carbon mineralization 

in marine sediments (24). This group of organisms is capable of anaerobic respiration, 

performing energy conservation through reduction of sulfate to sulfide. Also, since these 

organisms are able to use a vast variety of compounds as electron donors and electron 

acceptors, they have a great potential for biotechnological applications, such as 

bioremediation. Furthermore it was reported that sulfate-reducing bacteria can cause 

inflammatory bowel diseases in animals and humans (25).

 1.2.1 – Sulfur cycle 

 Sulfur is one of the most abundant elements on Earth and it can be found in different 

oxidation states, being sulfate (SO4
2-

; oxidation state +6), elemental sulfur (S
0
; oxidation state 

0), and sulfide (S
2-

; oxidation state -2) the most significant in nature (26, 27). The sulfur 

biogeochemical cycle is not only important in geology since many minerals are composed of 

sulfur but is also essential in biology since amino acids (cysteine and methionine) and many 

other biomolecules contain sulfur atoms. SRO play a critical role in the sulfur cycle since they 

use sulfate as terminal electron acceptor in the degradation of organic matter to produce 

sulfide (Figure 1.6). Both these sulfur forms are used in the metabolism of other organisms 

generating the microbial sulfur cycle (26). Stable isotope fractionation studies show that sulfur 

has been reduced biologically for over 3.5 billion years (28). 

 

 

 

Figure 1.6 – Microbial sulfur cycle. SRO reduce sulfate (SO4
2-

) to sulfide (H2S). Sulfide can then 

be oxidized aerobically by chemolithotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (e.g. Thiobacillus or 

Beggiatoa spp.) or anaerobically by phototrophic sulfur bacteria (e.g. Chlorobium spp.) to 

elemental sulfur (S
0
) and sulfate. Other transformations, which are carried out by specialized 

groups of microorganisms, result in sulfur reduction (e.g. Desulfuromonas spp.) and sulfur 

disproportionation (e.g. Desulfovibrio sulfodismutans). Adapted from (24). 
 

 1.2.2 – Physiology and Biochemistry 

 SRO are chemoheterotrophs since they generate their energy through chemical 

reactions and require organic carbon for cell growth. They are also capable of either 

lithotrophic or organotrophic growth since they can use a great diversity of electron donors 

such as hydrogen, fatty acids, aromatic compounds, sugars, monocarboxylic acids, and 

dicarboxylic acids (29). Sulfate is not the sole terminal electron acceptor in SRO, as other

sulfur compounds can also be used such as sulfite (SO3
2-

), thiosulfate (S2O3
2-

), elemental 

sulfur (S
0
), and organosulfonates. Moreover, some species of SRO can use other electron 

acceptors as nitrate and nitrite, which are reduced to ammonium and also metal ion oxides 

including iron (Fe
III
), uranyl (U

VI
), selenite (Se

VI
), chromate (Cr

VI
), and arsenate (As

VI
) 

therefore revealing a great potential in bioremediation of toxic metals (24). 

 Many organisms including bacteria, fungi, algae, and plants are capable of 

assimilatory sulfate reduction in which small amounts of sulfide are produced and 

incorporated into sulfur-containing amino acids, vitamins and cofactors (30). SRO perform 

dissimilatory sulfate reduction, i.e. the reduction of sulfate for energy conservation while 

producing large amounts of sulfide, a toxic gas in the protonated form. Moreover, some 

sulfate reducers are able to survive in low concentrations of oxygen, showing that these 

organisms are not strict anaerobes (31). 

 1.2.3 – Taxonomy 

 The first SRO to be isolated and described was named Spirillum desulfuricans due to 

its morphology and ability to produce sulfide from sulfate (32). This discovery dates from 1895 

and was attributed to the Dutch microbiologist and botanist Martinus Beijerinck; the bacterium 

was later reclassified as Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (Figure 1.7). Classification of these 

organisms was based on phenotypic characteristics, which limited the number of species until 

the 1980’s. With the advent of Molecular Biology new methods based on the rRNA 16S gene, 

PCR, and genome sequencing started to emerge and were used to discover numerous novel 

species of SRO (24). 

 

 

 

Figure 1.7 – The figure is a reproduction of Vibrio desulfuricans, which was painted by Henriëtte 

Beijerinck, the sister of Martinus Beijerinck, and is reproduced courtesy of the Beijerinck Museum 

(24). 

   



 9 

 There are more than 220 species of 60 genera of SRO described, either from the 

Bacteria or Archaea Domain. Within the Bacteria Domain, these organisms belong to five 

divisions: Deltaproteobacteria class (including Desulfovibrio and 11 other genus), Nitrospira 

phylum (containing the genus Thermodesulfovibrio), Clostridia class (containing the Gram-

positive, spore-forming genus Desulfotomaculum, Desulfosporomusa, and 

Desulfosporosinus), Thermodesulfobiaceae family, and Thermodesulfobacteria phylum. 

Within the Archaea Domain, two phyla are distinguished: Euryarchaeota (containing the 

Archaeoglobus genus) and Crenarchaeota (containing the genus Thermocladium and 

Caldivirga) (Figure 1.8) (24, 29). From these organisms, 72 genome sequences are already 

available according to the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) website.

sequences. It is possible to observe five phylogenetic lineages of Bacteria Domain organisms and 

two of Archaea Domain organisms. The 0.10 scale bar indicates 10 % of sequence difference.

 1.2.4 – Environmental impact 

 SRO have an important environmental impact since they intervene in biocorrosion of 

ferrous metals and also corrosion of concrete and stonework (29). These microorganisms 

also have a negative impact on the petroleum industry since they can contribute to a 

phenomenon called “oil souring” by sulfide production in oil fields and pipelines. 

 Since SRO have a very plastic metabolism they have a great biotechnological 

potential. These microorganisms are capable of bioremediation of several compounds by 

oxidation, such as organic compounds, monoaromatic hydrocarbons present in contamination 

due to petroleum spills; reduction of halogenated compounds, which contaminate waters and 

sediment, and are used as terminal electron acceptor (dehalorespiration); nitroaromatic 

respiration, such as TNT (trinitrotoluene) which contaminates soils and ground water near 

places where explosives are manufactured (29). Also, SRO are capable of immobilization of 

hazardous and toxic metals released by metallurgic plants, nuclear plants or oil refining 

industry via precipitation as metal sulfides. A restricted group of SRO called DMRB 

(dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria) is capable of toxic metal reduction (such as uranium) 

posing an important contribution for toxic environment bioremediation. Reduction of azo dyes, 

which contain an azo bond (N=N) and are abundantly produced in the textile industry, is also 

performed by this group of organisms; finally, SRO are capable of biorecovery of precious 

metals such as gold, platinum, or palladium from industrial waste streams (33). 

 Concerning the high potential of SRO in biotechnology, the study of the physiology 

and full comprehension of the metabolism of these organisms is imperative to further develop 

new and more powerful biotechnological tools. 

 

 

 1.3 – The Desulfovibrio genus 
 

 Desulfovibrio is one of many genus of sulfate-reducing bacteria belonging to the 

Deltaproteobacteria class. Desulfovibrio species exist in marine environents, but also in hot 

springs, geothermal vents, the human digestive tract, and in soil (34). These bacteria are not 

strict anaerobes as previously considered, since they tolerate oxygen concentration but their 

growth is limited in aerobic environments. The optimal growth temperature for the mesophilic 

Desulfovibrio bacteria ranges from 25 – 40 ºC while the optimal pH ranges between 6.6 – 7.5. 

Since D. vulgaris Hildenborough was the first SRO to have its genome sequenced and due to 

its easy and rapid growth it has been used as a model for studying the physiology, genetics, 

and biochemistry of these organisms (35). 

 

 

 

 

 



 11 

 1.3.1 – Morphology, biochemistry, and genome features 

 Desulfovibrio species are non-sporulating curved rod-shaped cells with sizes 

between 0.5 – 1.3 x 0.8 – 5 ?m (36). These cells are motile with a single polar flagellum and 

stain Gram negative. These microbes use hydrogen, organic acids, or alcohols as electron 

donors for sulfate reduction. Lactate is preferentially used for carbon metabolism but 

pyruvate, formate, and certain primary alcohols also function as carbon sources. The model 

organism D. vulgaris Hildenborough was discovered and isolated in 1946 in clay soil near 

Hildenborough, Kent, England (35). The genome contains two replicons: one chromosome 

containing 3.57 Mbp and one mega plasmid containing 202 kbp. The GC percentage of the 

replicons is 63.2 and 65.7, respectively (35). 

 1.3.2 – Taxonomy 

 D. vulgaris Hildenborough belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria and class 

Deltaproteobacteria. The order of these bacteria is Desulfovibrionales, the family is 

Desulfovibrionacea and the genus is Desulfovibrio. In the last decade several genomes of 

SRO were sequenced and deposited in online databases such as MicrobesOnline, Integrated 

Microbial Genomes (IMG), and National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). There 

are over 60 known species of the Desulfovibrio genus, from which 43 genomes are available 

according to the IMG website. Very recently, the genome of Desulfovibrio gigas was 

sequenced through a collaboration between a group at ITQB and Brazilian researchers (37). 

 1.3.3 – Dissimilatory sulfate reduction 

 Dissimilatory sulfate reduction occurs in the cytoplasm of SRO and requires the 

presence of four soluble enzymes. In order to fully reduce sulfate to sulfide, eight electrons 

are necessary and approximately two ATP molecules are used for sulfate activation (Figure 

1.9). Sulfate is transported inside the cell by symport with Na
+
 or H

+
, depending on the marine 

or fresh-water environment, respectively (38). Since sulfate reduction to sulfite is chemically 

unfavorable [E
o,
 (SO4

2-
/SO3

2-
) = – 516 mV] sulfate requires activation to a more favorable 

compound. In the presence of the ATP sulfurylase or adenylyltransferase (Sat), sulfate and 

ATP are converted to adenosine-5’-phosphosulfate (APS generating pyrophosphate (PPi). 

Some SRO have membrane associated pyrophosphatases that couple the hydrolysis of PPi 

to proton translocation across the membrane minimizing the energy costs of sulfate reduction 

(20). APS [E
o,
 (APS/SO3

2-
) = – 60 mV] accepts two electrons being reduced to sulfite and 

AMP by the APS reductase enzyme (AprBA). The physiological electron donor to AprBA is 

still unknown but several lines of evidence point to the Quinone-interacting membrane-bound 

oxidoreductase (QmoABC) membrane complex (39, 40). After sulfite formation, the final 

reduction of sulfite to sulfide [E
o,
 (SO3

2-
/H2S) = – 116 mV] requires 6 electrons and two 

mechanisms were proposed to explain this reduction: the trithionate pathway, in which sulfite 

is reduced to sulfide in three steps, by the intermediates trithionate (S3O6
2-

) and thiosulfate 

(S2O3
2-

) (32); and the second mechanism, which explains the 6 electron reduction in only one 



 12 

step, catalyzed by the dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DsrAB or dSir) without formation of any 

intermediates (41). There is evidence that a third protein, named DsrC but not encoded in the 

same operon of DsrA and DsrB, is involved in the final reduction of sulfite to sulfide (41). 

DsrC functions not as a subunit of DsrAB but as an interacting protein by entering the cleft 

between DsrA and DsrB, as the crystal structure of DsrAB-DsrC complex from D. vulgaris 

revealed (41). DsrK (a subunit from the DsrMKJOP membrane complex) functions as the 

potential physiological electron donor to DsrC (42). Since the dsrMKJOP gene cluster is in 

close proximity to a gene encoding a Fd, there might be an involvement of a Fd in sulfite 

reduction and other soluble electron transfer pathways (20).

pathway. Adapted from (41). Cube – [4Fe-4S]; diamond - [2Fe-2S];  – heme b;  – heme c;  – 

sirohydrochlorine. 

 
 
 

 Immediately downstream from the dsrAB genes a small gene named dsrD which 

codes for a 9 kDa protein is present (43). This gene is specific of SRO, although dsrD is 

absent in some thiosulfate reducers (e.g. Thermosinus carboxydivorans and 

Thermanaeromonas toyohensis) and is also not present in sulfur-oxidizing organisms (44). 

Furthermore, in the anaerobic taurine-degrading gut bacterium Bilophila wadsworthia 

RZATAU the dsrD gene is fused to the dsrB gene, forming a DsrB-DsrD fusion protein (45). 

Interestingly it has also been shown that dsrD is strongly downregulated in the presence of 

sulfide (46). These results suggest a possible involvement of DsrD in the dissimilatory sulfite 



 13 

reduction. However, DsrD was not found associated with DsrAB during the purification 

methods and in vitro studies revealed that this protein binds sulfate, sulfite, and sulfide with 

low affinity (47). Since the structure of DsrD includes a winged-helix motif, a B- and Z-DNA 

binding motif, it has been hypothesized that DsrD is associated to sulfate reduction not in a 

direct biochemical association but via regulation of sulfite reduction genes (Figure 1.10) (48). 

Despite some structural, biophysical, and biochemical studies performed with this protein, the 

physiological function of DsrD remains to be solved.

2 – Objectives 
  

 

 

 This thesis focuses on two main objectives. 

 The first objective is to study the hdr-flox gene cluster possibly involved in an electron 

bifurcation pathway present in the model organism D. vulgaris Hildenborough. It was 

ultimately desired to elucidate and better understand the metabolic importance of this gene 

cluster and to analyze in which conditions these genes were more expressed both at a gene 

and protein level. 

 The second part of this thesis focuses on the study of dsrD, a potentially relevant 

gene involved in the dissimilatory sulfate reduction whose function in the physiology of SRO 

remains a mystery. The main objective of this study is to provide new hints about the function 

of this protein both with in vitro and in vivo assays, while contributing to a better 

understanding of the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway, in particular in the sulfite 

reduction.

   3 – Materials and Methods 

 

 3.1 – hdr-flox gene cluster 

 3.1.1 – Strains and media 

 The strains used in this work were previously constructed by Fabian Grein (49) and 

are listed in Table 3.1. All D. vulgaris Hildenborough strains were grown in anaerobic 

conditions, in MOY basal medium (39). MOY medium contains 8 mM MgCl2, 20 mM NH4Cl, 

0.6 mM CaCl2, 2 mM K2HPO4-NaH2PO4, 0.06 mM FeCl, 0.12 mM EDTA, 30 mM Tris-HCl pH 

7.4, 1 g/L of yeast extract, 6 mL of trace element solution (39), and 1 mL of Thauers vitamins 

solution (50) per liter. Thauer’s vitamin solution contains 82 ?M biotin, 45 ?M folic acid, 

468 ?M pyridoxine hydrochloride, 148 ?M thiamine hydrochloride, 133 ?M riboflavin, 406 ?M 

nicotinic acid, 210 ?M DL-panthotenic acid, 365 ?M p-aminobenzoic acid, 242 ?M lipoic acid, 

14 mM choline chloride, and 7.4 ?M vitamin B12. Additionally, 1.2 mM thioglycolate was used 

as a reducing agent and 640 nM resazurin solution was used as a redox potential indicator 

(which becomes pink when the potential exceeds 110 mV). The pH was adjusted with 1 M 

HCl to the final value of 7.2. MOY was supplemented with different electron donors-acceptors 

in five different culture conditions: 60 mM lactate-30 mM sulfate (LS4); 30 mM lactate-20 mM 

sulfite (LS3); 60 mM pyruvate-2 mM sulfate (P); 40 mM ethanol-20 mM sulfate (ES4); and 

finally 1 bar hydrogen (H2)-30 mM sulfate supplemented with 10 mM acetate (HS4). The 

cultures containing hydrogen as electron donor were gassed at 1 atm pressure with 80% H2 

(v/v) and 20 % CO2 and incubated at 37 °C in a horizontal position in order to increase the 

gas-liquid surface area. 

 3.1.2 – Growth curves 

 D. vulgaris Hildenborough WT and mutant strain cultures were grown anaerobically at 

37 °C in 100 mL flasks containing a final volume of 50 mL. All flasks were inoculated with 2 % 

(v/v) of fresh precultured cells grown on lactate-sulfate medium except for the pyruvate 

growth (P), in which cells were precultured in pyruvate medium (P), and for the media with 

hydrogen, in which 10 % (v/v) of pre-culture cells was used. The optical density (OD at 600 

nm) was monitored at various time points with a spectrophotometer Shimadzu UV-1603. All 

reported optical density measurements are the mean of four biologically independent 

experiments. 

 3.1.3 – Ethanol quantification 

 Ethanol accumulation in the growth medium was determined with an enzymatic kit 

from NZYTech. This method is based on quantifying NADH formed from ethanol through the 

combined action of Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (Al-dh).

elution was performed with a linear gradient of 1 to 0 M NaCl (20 CV). Fractions with highest 

Adh activity eluted between 1 and 0.7 M NaCl. The identity of the enzyme purified was 

confirmed as Adh1 by Mass spectrometry. Adh activity was determined by NADH formation at

at room temperature (51) with a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer in a stirred cuvette 

(Hellma). Adh1 antibody was produced from pure protein injected in rabbits, at Davids

 3.1.5 – Reverse Transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) 

 Reverse Transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used in D. vulgaris WT to 

analyze gene expression of adh1, floxA, and hdrA in cells grown in LS4, LS3, P, ES4, and 

HS4. Cells from three independent experiments were collected at the mid-exponential phase, 

centrifuged for 12 min at 3,000 g, washed with ice-cold sterile Mili-Q water, and frozen for 

later RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted as described in (52). DNase treatment was 

performed with Turbo DNase (Ambion) in order to avoid genomic DNA contamination in the 

RNA extracts and was also followed by a RNA clean-up kit (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis from 

each RNA sample (1 ?g) was performed using Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase (Roche 

Diagnostics). Primers were designed to amplify a region of about 100 bp of adh1, floxA, hdrA, 

and the 16S rRNA gene was used as an internal reference gene for each analyzed sample 

(Table 3.2). Reverse Transcriptase quantitative PCR reactions were performed in a Light 

Cycler 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche), with Light Cycler 480 SYBR Green Master I 

(Roche). Relative standard curves and gene expression were calculated by the relative 

quantification method with efficiency correction, using the LightCycler Software 4.1, using 16S 

rRNA gene as a reference (53). For the final results three biological replicates and two 

technical replicates were used for each condition. The unpaired (two-sample equal variance 

with two-tailed distribution) t-test was used to determine the significance of the differences in 

gene expression between cells grown in LS4 and cells grown in the other culture conditions, 

with a significance defined as p-value &amp;lt;0.10 and p-value &amp;lt;0.05.

 3.1.6 – Western blot analysis of FloxA, HdrA, and Adh1 expression 

 D. vulgaris WT cells grown in lactate-sulfate (LS4), lactate-sulfite (LS3), pyruvate (P), 

ethanol-sulfate (ES4), and hydrogen-sulfate (HS4), were collected at two different time points, 

mid-exponential and stationary phase, and centrifuged for 12 min at 3,000 g. Cells were then 

disrupted by adding 1 mL of BugBuster
®
 Protein Extraction Reagent (Novagen

®
) and 10 ?L of 

lysonase per g of cells, followed by 20 min incubation with slow stirring at room temperature. 

The soluble crude extract was obtained by centrifugation at 16,000 g and 4 °C for 20 min. 

Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum 

albumin as standard (NZYTech). 

 Protein samples of 25 ?g were run in a SDS-PAGE gel [12 % acrylamide, (v/v)] and 

transferred to 0.45 ?m polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Roche) for 30 minutes at 

100 V and 350 mA in a Mini Trans-Blot
®
 electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) containing 

Transfer Buffer (48 mM Tris pH 9.2, 39 mM glycine). The membranes were treated with 

Blocking Buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05 % Tween 20 (v/v), and 5 % non-

fat milk (w/v)], overnight at room temperature. In the following day, after three washing steps 

with TBST [20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05 % Tween 20 (v/v)], anti-FloxA at 

1 : 1000, anti-HdrA 1 : 500, and anti-Adh1 at 1 : 5000 dillution in TBST were incubated with 

the membrane for 1 h at room temperature; after two washing steps with TBST, membranes 

were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG antibody linked to alkaline phosphatase conjugate 

(Sigma-Aldrich
®
) at 1 : 15 000 dilltuion in TBST for 45 minutes. After three washing steps with 

TBS (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) protein detection was performed with Alkaline 

Phosphatase Buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl2) and NBT 

(nitro-blue tetrazolium chloride)/BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate) (Carl Roth
®
). 

The antibodies used against FloxA and HdrA subunits were produced in rabbits with 

synthesized peptides and Adh1 antibody was produced from pure protein, as previously 

referred.

 3.2 – Studies with dsrD 

 3.2.1 – dsrD heterologous expression 

 3.2.1.1 – dsrD gene cloning and protein expression 

 The dsrD gene of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough was amplified by PCR using 

genomic DNA as template and the dsrD fw and dsrD rev primers with NdeI and XhoI 

restriction sites, respectively (Table 3.1). The PCR product was cloned into a pET22b(+) 

vector (Novagen
®
), allowing the insertion of a 6-His tag at the C-terminus of DsrD protein. The 

recombinant plasmid (pET
22

dsrD) was heat-shock transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) Gold 

(Stratagene
®
) strains which were grown at 37 °C in Minimal Medium with ampicillin (100 

µg/mL) until an optical density of 0.4. Then 100 µM IPTG (isopropyl ?-D-1-

thiogalactopyranoside) was added and cells were permitted to grow for 4 additional hours. 

 3.2.1.2 – DsrD purification 

 The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with Buffer A (25 mM potassium 

phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole pH 7.2) and frozen to – 20 ºC. After thawing and 

ressuspending with Buffer A the cells were disrupted using a French Press cell in the 

presence of DNase. Afterwards, the cell lysate was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 20,000 g in 

order to remove cell debris, and then ultra centrifuged for 2 h at 140,000 g to separate the 

membrane from the soluble fraction. The supernatant was injected into a HiTrap Chelating 

HP column (GEHealthcare) charged with NiCl2 and equilibrated with Buffer A. The protein 

was eluted with Buffer B (Buffer A with 100 mM imidazole) and dialyzed to 25 mM potassium 

phosphate pH 7. The protein purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie 

Blue and the concentration was determined at 280 nm using the absorption coefficient of 10 

mM
-1

cm
-1

 and with the BCA (bicinchoninic acid assay) kit by Pierce
®
. 

 3.2.1.3 – DsrD activity and interaction assays 

 DsrABC was tested for sulfite reduction activity in the presence of DsrD in order to 

analyze if there was any interaction between these molecules capable of modifying the 

reaction rate. The enzymatic activities were performed in a Coy anaerobic chamber [95 %/ 5 

% (v/v) N2/H2] with a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer in a stirred cuvette (Hellma), 

monitoring the oxidation of methyl viologen (an electron acceptor reduced by Zn
2+

) mediated 

by DsrABC, which transfers electrons to sulfite. The assays were developed in Wash Buffer 

(25 mM KPi pH7) at room temperature, measuring the variation of Abs732 nm through time. 

 BIAcore experiments were performed with DsrD and DsrABC. BIAcore is a 

technology based on the Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) principle, which permits the 

determination of affinity constants between two interacting proteins. DsrD was chemically 

immobilized in a CM5 sensor chip (GE
®
 Healthcare) to which DsrABC was injected and 

interaction of these two proteins was measured. The SPR experiments were performed at 

25 °C on a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Biacore Inc., GE
®
 HealthCare). 



 20 

 Additionally, Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) technique was also performed to 

measure interactions between DsrD and DsrABC or sulfite. ITC is a biophysical method that 

allows the measurement of thermodynamics and binding association of molecules in solution 

by detecting the heat change in molecular reactions. The ITC experiments were performed at 

25 °C on a MicroCalTM (GE
®
 Healthcare). 

 

 3.2.2 – dsrD deletion 

 3.2.2.1 – Strains and media 

 The strains used in this work are listed in Table 3.1. Escherichia coli ?-Select strain 

was cultured in LB medium (per liter of medium: 10 g tryptone, 10 g sodium chloride, and 5 g 

yeast extract). Where indicated, kanamycin or spectinomycin was added to LB medium to a 

final concentration of 50 µg/mL and 100 µg/mL, respectively. All D. vulgaris strains were 

grown at 37 °C in MOY medium according to (39). Sodium lactate (60 mM) or sodium 

pyruvate (30 mM) were added as electron donors and sodium sulfate (30 mM for lactate and 

3 mM for pyruvate) or sodium sulfite (20 mM for lactate) were added as terminal electron 

acceptors Antibiotics were added to the MOY medium as follows: G418 (geneticin) at 400 

µg/mL or spectinomycin at 100 µg/mL. G418 was used in place of kanamycin as described by 

Zane et al. 2010. For solidified MOY medium, 15 g agar per liter was added. 

 3.2.2.2 – Plasmid and strain construction 

 The pMOIP17 plasmid for insertion of ?Km cassette in dsrD was constructed by SLIC 

(sequence ligation independent cloning). The upstream and downstream regions flanking 

dsrD were amplified using the primers 97, 98, 99, and 100, respectively, (Table 3.1) and 

chromosomal DNA of D. vulgaris was used as template. Also, a spectinomycin resistance 

cassette and the pMO719 template containing pUC ori and Kanamycin resistance cassette 

were all amplified by PCR, using pSC27 and pMO719, respectively, as templates and primers 

9, 10, 11, and 12. The four PCR products were added to a reaction mix with T4 ligase 

incubated for 30 min at room temperature. 1 mM dCTP (deoxycytidine triphosphate) was then 

added the DNA was heat-shock transformed into E. coli ?-Select competent cells and plated 

into kanamycin and spectinomycin containing LA plates. The assembled plasmid (pMOIP17) 

was extracted, sequenced, and electroporated into D. vulgaris cells according to Keller et al. 

(2011) from which double recombinants were selected in MOY solid medium with 30 mM of 

sodium pyruvate by secondary antibiotic screening as described in (54). G418 was used in 

place of kanamycin as described by Zane et al. (2010). G418 resistant but spectinomycin 

sensitive colonies were selected and allowed to grow in G418 containing growth medium. The 

absence of the dsrD gene in the dsrD mutant strain was verified by PCR using the dsrD fw 

and dsrD rev primers with the chromosomal DNA extracted from the screened cells.

 3.2.2.3 – Growth curves 

 D. vulgaris Hildenborough WT and dsrD mutant strains were grown anaerobically at 

37 °C in 100 mL flasks with 50 mL of MOY basal medium (39). MOY was supplemented with 

different electron donors-acceptors in three different culture conditions: 60 mM lactate-30 mM 

sulfate (LS4); 30 mM lactate-20 mM sulfite (LS3); 30 mM pyruvate-3 mM sulfate (Pyr). All 

media were inoculated with 2 % (v/v) fresh precultured cells grown in pyruvate-sulfate 

medium (Pyr). The OD of the cultures was monitored at various time points with a 

spectrophotometer Shimadzu UV-1603. All reported optical density measurements are the 

mean of three biologically independent experiments.

4 - Results 
 

 4.1 – The hdr-flox gene cluster 

 4.1.1 – Growth curves 

 To evaluate the physiological function of the flox and hdr genes, the strains IPFG01 

(hdrC::?Km) and IPFG02 (?floxA::Km
R
) were generated where a kanamycin resistance 

cassette was inserted in the hdrC gene, preventing translation of downstream genes 

(IPFG01), and the floxA gene was specifically deleted by replacement with a kanamycin 

resistance cassette (IPFG02). Additionally, in order to confirm that the phenotype of IPFG02 

was due to the absence of floxA, a FloxA-complemented strain expressing FloxA from a 

plasmid was constructed and named strain IPFG03 (IPFG02 + pMOIP12P). D. vulgaris WT, 

IPFG01, and IPFG02 strains were grown in lactate-sulfate (LS4), lactate-sulfite (LS3), 

pyruvate fermentation (P), ethanol-sulfate (ES4), or hydrogen-sulfate (HS4) medium (Figure 

4.1, Table 4.1). The three mutant strains behaved similarly to WT using lactate as an electron 

donor, both with sulfate or sulfite as terminal electron acceptors (Figure 4.1A, 4.1B), whereas 

in pyruvate fermentation strains IPFG01 and IPFG02 had a similar growth rate, but the final 

OD was slightly lower than the WT and complemented strains (Figure 4.1C). Interestingly, in 

ethanol-sulfate conditions both mutant strains, IPFG01 or IPFG02, were unable to grow, while 

the complemented strain grew to a similar growth rate and maximum OD compared to the WT 

(Figure 4.1D). In HS4 medium strains IPFG01 and IPFG02 grew somewhat slower than the 

WT and reached a lower cell density. Since IPFG02 was not capable of growing in ES4 

medium while WT and IPFG03 did, we can conclude that FloxA is essential for ethanol 

oxidation in D. vulgaris. Ethanol has also been reported as a metabolic product of D. vulgaris 

Hildenborough, produced in higher amounts with pyruvate as an electron donor than with 

lactate (55). To check whether the Hdr-Flox proteins are involved in the production of ethanol 

as a fermentative product during growth on pyruvate, we quantified ethanol accumulated in 

the growth media of the WT and mutant strains. The WT strain accumulated a considerable 

amount of ethanol in the growth medium, while ethanol was absent in the two mutant strains 

IPFG01 and IPFG02 (Figure 4.2). The complemented strain IPFG03 produced similar levels 

of ethanol as the WT, confirming a role of Flox-Hdr in ethanol production during pyruvate 

fermentation.

 4.1.2 – Adh1 purification and activity measurements 

 To test whether the FloxABCD-HdrABC complex is involved in electron bifurcation it 

is essential to isolate the proteins and perform the bifurcation assays in vitro.
 
Several 

attempts were made to purify the Hdr and Flox proteins but due to their very low expression it 

was not possible to obtain these proteins in the amount required for enzymatic assays. 

However, Adh1 was purified without difficulty to a specific activity of 4.6 U/mg, confirming that 

this protein is abundant in D. vulgaris. We confirmed its co-enzyme preference for NAD
+
, 

which gave a 10-fold higher activity than NADP
+
.

 4.1.3 – Reverse Transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) 

 In order to get more insight into the physiological function of the hdr-flox gene cluster 

we studied the relative gene expression of floxA, hdrA, and adh1 genes by RT-qPCR at mid-

exponential growth phase from cells grown with lactate, ethanol, or hydrogen as electron 

donors for sulfate reduction, by pyruvate fermentation, and with lactate as electron donor and 

sulfite as electron acceptor (Figure 4.3). The hdrA gene shows the highest expression in 

ethanol-sulfate (ES4) followed by pyruvate fermentation (P) conditions, and lowest expression 

in lactate-sulfite (LS3) and hydrogen-sulfate (HS4) conditions. A similar expression behavior 

is observed for the floxA gene, except for the P condition where the expression is lower than 

in LS4. The adh1 gene also shows highest relative expression in ES4 and P conditions.

exponential phase of cell growth either on lactate-sulfate (LS4), lactate-sulfite (LS3), pyruvate (P),

represented on the y-axis. The 16S rRNA gene was used as reference. The results were obtained 

from three independent biological replicates (means ± standard errors). * – p-value &amp;lt;0.1; **– p-

value &amp;lt;0.05 (t-test). 

 
 

 4.1.4 – Western blot analysis of FloxA, HdrA, and Adh1 expression 

 To complement the RT-qPCR results, we analyzed also the expression of FloxA, 

HdrA, and Adh1 proteins by Western blot in D. vulgaris WT cells grown in the same 

conditions and collected at two time points: mid-exponential and beginning of the stationary 

phase (Figure 4.4). The Western blot analysis confirms that the relative protein expression 

levels of FloxA, HdrA, and Adh1 at middle exponential phase are highest in ES4 conditions. 

Again, HdrA and Adh1 also show strong expression in P conditions. Overall, there is good 

agreement between the mRNA levels and the protein levels for the three cases. In the 

stationary phase the levels of FloxA decrease, except in ES4 conditions, whereas HdrA 

shows a strong decrease in all conditions. In contrast, Adh1 expression is even higher at the 

stationary phase for ES4 and LS4 conditions.

and HdrA were used for immunodetection using 25 ?g of crude extract. (B) Relative densitometry

 4.2 – Studies with dsrD 

 4.2.1 – DsrD activity and interaction assays 

 Several attempts were made to study the direct interaction of DsrD with dissimilatory 

sulfite reduction enzymes (DsrAB and DsrC) and with sulfite. Firstly, enzymatic activity 

assays were performed in anaerobic conditions adding DsrD to DsrAB and sulfite in a 

reaction mixture. Then, protein-protein interaction assays were performed with BIAcore, 

which is based on the Surface Plasmon Resonance principle and allows the determination of 

affinity constants. Protein-ligand interaction assays were performed with Isothermal Titration 

Calorimetry, a biophysical technique that allows to determine thermodynamic parameters 

[binding affinity (Ka), enthalpy changes (?H), and binding stoichiometry (n)] of the interaction 

between two or more molecules in solution. Despite all these attempts no evidence was 

obtained to support the interaction of DsrD with DsrAB, DsrC, or even sulfite.

 4.2.2 – Growth curves 

 In order to understand the function of the dsrD gene in the physiology of D. vulgaris 

cells, a dsrD mutant was constructed by replacing the dsrD gene with a kanamycin resistance 

cassette. Both WT and dsrD deletion mutant were grown in pyruvate, lactate-sulfate, and 

lactate-sulfite medium (Figure 4.5). Both strains behaved similarly during pyruvate 

fermentation even though the dsrD deletion mutant reached the stationary phase a few hours 

after the WT (Figure 4.5A) A more prominent phenotypic difference appears when both 

strains were cultured in lactate-sulfate medium (Figure 4.5B) in which the dsrD deletion 

mutant shows a great increase in the lag phase compared to the WT. After the long lag 

phase, the mutant strain grows to a final OD similar to the observed in the WT. Interestingly, 

in lactate-sulfite medium (Figure 4.5C), dsrD mutant cells were not able to grow while the WT 

strain reached the stationary phase after around 45 hours.

5 – Discussion 
 
 

 5.1 – The hdr-flox gene cluster 

 Despite the vast amount of studies concerning SRO, the energy metabolism of these 

organisms is still not fully elucidated. Genomic studies of SRO focusing on genes involved in 

energy metabolism revealed the presence of several proteins similar to enzymes of other 

organisms involved in FBEB, suggesting that this energy conservation mechanism is also 

relevant in SRO (20). FBEB is a novel mechanism of energy conservation in anaerobes, 

which couples an exergonic reaction to the endergonic Fd reduction (56). One example of 

FBEB is the HdrABC-MvhADG complex in methanogens, which couples the reduction of Fd 

with the reduction of CoM-S-S-CoB heterodisulfide by H2 (Figure 1.3) (17). The bifurcating 

protein is believed to be the flavoprotein HdrA. HdrA and HdrABC proteins are found in many 

SRO, despite the absence of CoM-S-S-CoB heterodisulfide in these organisms (20). A new 

gene cluster hdrABC-floxABCD was found in many bacterial SRO and proposed to encode a 

new putative NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (FloxABCD) forming a complex with HdrABC 

analogous to the MvhADG-HdrABC complex of methanogens (20). The floxA gene codes for 

a FAD and NAD(P)-binding domains protein, similar to the P. furiosus SH subunit ?, while the 

floxB and floxC genes are related to rnfC and both code for iron-sulfur proteins similar to the 

P. furiosus SH subunit ? (20).The floxD gene codes for a protein similar to MvhD, which in 

methanogens is involved in electron transfer from Mvh to Hdr (57). The floxC and floxD are 

fused into one single gene in several organisms, including D. vulgaris.  

 Several genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies have been performed over 

the last years regarding the energy metabolism of SRO, using the model organism D. vulgaris 

Hildenborough and other Desulfovibrio species (22), (58), (59), (60), (61). The flox-hdr genes 

are often affected in these studies suggesting a relevant function in the energy metabolism, 

although not essential for sulfate reduction. In D. vulgaris, the flox-hdr gene cluster is present 

upstream of an alcohol dehydrogenase coding gene (adh1), which is highly expressed in D. 

vulgaris grown with lactate, pyruvate, formate, ethanol, or hydrogen as electron donors for 

sulfate reduction (22). A mutant lacking this gene was unable to grow in ethanol-sulfate 

medium indicating that Adh1 is the main enzyme catalyzing ethanol oxidation in D. vulgaris 

(22). Haveman et al. proposed that the flox-hdr genes code for a hydrogenase:heterodisulfide 

reductase complex involved in a hydrogen cycling mechanism (22). However, the flox genes 

do not encode for a hydrogenase subunit (20). 

  



 29 

 In this work, we studied the physiological function of the flox-hdr genes in D. vulgaris, 

which were demonstrated to be part of the same transcriptional unit (49). Gene and protein 

expression analysis of D. vulgaris cells grown with different electron donors for sulfate or 

sulfite reduction showed that the highest expression of the floxA and hdrA genes is observed 

when ethanol is used as electron donor (Figure 4.3 and 4.4). Moreover, as previously 

reported (62), the adh1 gene is much more expressed than floxA and hdrA, further indicating 

that adh1 is not part of the same operon as the flox-hdr genes. This difference in gene 

expression was also reflected in the protein purification: although Adh1 was purified without 

difficulty, we were not successful in isolating the Flox or Hdr proteins. FloxA could be easily 

identified by Western blot in protein purification fractions, but no corresponding band would 

be present in Coomassie stain of SDS-PAGE gels, which meant that the levels of FloxA 

present were very low. We concluded that the transcription levels of the Flox-Hdr proteins in 

D. vulgaris are low, which agrees with previous microarray results (62). Despite the 

generation of strain IPFG04, with a tagged FloxA we were not able to isolate the Flox-Hdr 

proteins in sufficient amounts for further biochemical studies, even using cells grown in 

ethanol. 

 Phenotypic studies of strains IPFG01 and IPFG02 revealed that both strains are not 

able to grow using ethanol as an electron donor for sulfate reduction (Figure 4.1D). In the 

complemented strain IPFG03, growth with ethanol was restored confirming that the Flox-Hdr 

proteins and FloxA individually, are essential in the metabolic pathway for ethanol oxidation, 

which agrees with their higher expression in this condition. The probable pathway involving 

Adh1 and Flox-Hdr proteins starts with oxidation of ethanol by Adh1 with reduction of NAD
+
 to 

NADH (Figure 5.1A). FloxA, which has a FAD and a NAD(P) binding domain, oxidizes NADH 

and electrons are transferred to FloxB and FloxCD. FloxCD transfers electrons to HdrABC, 

probably through the MvhD-like domain in FloxCD, similarly to what happens in 

methanogens. The electron acceptor of HdrABC remains a question mark. As suggested 

before (20), we propose that this electron acceptor is the cysteine containing protein DsrC 

(44). Since the reduction of Fd by NADH is an unfavourable reaction, and by analogy to the 

function of HdrABC in methanogens, we propose that the oxidation of NADH by FloxABCD 

involves the process of FBEB, coupling the endergonic reduction of ferredoxin by NADH to 

the exergonic reduction of DsrC by NADH. Regeneration of NADH involving FloxABCD-

HdrABC is essential for the bioenergetics of D. vulgaris while growing on ethanol-sulfate, but 

not when the cells are growing on lactate-sulfate or pyruvate-sulfate, which agrees with the 

idea that pyridine nucleotides are not directly involved in the oxidation of lactate or pyruvate. 

We reasoned that Hdr-Flox could instead be involved in recycling NAD
+
 produced during 

Adh1 reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol, formed as an alternative pyruvate fermentation 

product (Figure 5.2). Ethanol production from pyruvate as carbon and energy source has 

been reported before for D. vulgaris (63). FloxA could reduce NAD
+
 with electrons coming 

from Fd oxidation by HdrABC. This reaction is favorable and would not require FBEB. Fd 

would be reduced by the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (Por). Ethanol production was 

measured from D. vulgaris cells growing by pyruvate fermentation, which confirmed that the  



 30 

 

 

 

WT strain produced significant levels of ethanol, which was not observed in the IPFG01 and 

IPFG02 strains, whereas ethanol production was similar in the complemented IPFG03 strain 

(Figure 4.2). These results reveal that the role of the Flox-Hdr proteins in fermentative 

conditions is to produce ethanol and thus recycling NAD
+
 (Figure 5.1B). In conclusion, we 

showed that the recently recognized FloxABCD proteins are essential for ethanol oxidation in 

D. vulgaris and are co-expressed with the HdrABC proteins, forming a complex that we 

propose to perform the coupled reduction of Fd and a disulfide (the DsrC protein in SRO) 

using the FBEB mechanism. In pyruvate fermentation, the FloxABCD-HdrABC complex 

operates in reverse to reduce NAD
+
, allowing the production of ethanol and the regeneration 

of oxidized Fd. It is clear that the FloxABCD-HdrABC proteins are involved in the metabolism 

of pyridine nucleotides and thus this work contributes to a better understanding of the role of 

these cofactors in SRO, which has been poorly defined so far. Importantly, it provides the first 

link between these cofactors and sulfate (sulfite) reduction through the DsrC protein. In a 

broader perspective, it is also important to note that the hdr-flox gene cluster is not exclusive 

of SRO, but is widespread among many anaerobic bacteria and thus FloxABCD constitutes a 

novel family of NAD(P)H oxidoreductases. The presence of the hdr-flox gene cluster in many 

different Bacteria and the strictly conserved organization of the genes reveal that the so far 

unidentified FloxABCD proteins, together with HdrABC, perform a general and important 

function in the energy metabolism of these organisms. As discussed above, the function of 

this protein complex will be to oxidize NADH with reduction of Fd and a high-redox-potential 

disulfide acceptor, involving the FBEB mechanism. Thus, this work identifies a new set of 

proteins possibly involved in FBEB, further demonstrating the importance of this mechanism 

in the bioenergetics of anaerobic prokaryotes (64). Future work will focus on trying to isolate 

this complex from other organisms to confirm in vitro the FBEB process.

transferred to HdrABC, which can then bifurcate them to Fd and a second electron acceptor that 

we propose to be DsrC. (B) In D. vulgaris growing by pyruvate fermentation, Adh1 reduces

 5.2 – Studies with dsrD  

 Despite the fact that the structure of DsrD has been obtained for some years now, the 

actual physiological function of this gene in SRO remains unknown (48). In D. vulgaris 

Hildenborough, dsrD is present in the operon dsrABD, in which the first two genes code for 

the dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DsrAB) (43). DsrAB is present in all SRO and together with 

DsrC is responsible for the reduction of sulfite to sulfide. Additionally, in the taurine-degrading 

Bilophila wadsworthia the dsrD gene is fused to the dsrB gene, forming a DsrB-DsrD fusion 

protein (45). These data suggest that DsrD may play a direct biochemical role in reduction of 

sulfite to sulfide. However, Hittel et al. have shown that DsrD binds sulfur species such as 

sulfite, sulfide, and sulfate with low affinity (47) and also DsrD is not found associated with 

DsrAB following purification. The tri-dimensional structure of DsrD reveals protein homology 

to DNA binding proteins and the presence of one winged-helix domain (48). Winged helix 

proteins, a sub-family of the helix-turn-helix protein family, contain DNA-binding domains that 

could bind either Z- or B-DNA. Furthermore, the proteins in the DsrD family have a well-

conserved sequence (YWSSGSTT) near their C terminus which may be related to DNA 

binding (48). 

 In this work the purified recombinant DsrD was tested for interaction with DsrAB, 

DsrC, and sulfite both by enzymatic activity and biophysical assays (BIAcore and Isothermal 

Titration Calorimetry) providing no positive results. Furthermore, a deletion mutant of the dsrD 

gene was constructed. In the growth curves we observed that in comparison to the WT, the 

dsrD mutant had a long lag phase in lactate-sulfate medium, which was not detectable in 

pyruvate fermentation medium, therefore allowing us to conclude that dsrD is involved in 

sulfate respiration. However, after about 45 hours, the mutant strain started to grow, reaching 

the same OD as the WT. Korte et al. observed the same phenotypic phenomenon when D. 

vulgaris cells were grown in the presence of high concentrations of nitrate, an inhibitor of 

SRO. They concluded that nitrate resistance in WT cultures was likely conferred by 

spontaneous mutations, which allowed cell growth in nitrate-stress after a few days (65). This 

result may tell us not only that the dsrD deleted strain undergoes spontaneous mutations that 

eventually allow adaptation to sulfate medium but also that dsrD may be regulating dsrAB and 

hence affect the respiratory pathway. This adaptation is thought to occur in genes with 

redundant function as the one as dsrD, allowing to bypass the mutation phenotype. In sulfite 

growing cultures it was interesting to observe that the mutant strain was not able to grow. 

This may be caused by the fact that dsrD deletion strain is more susceptible to sulfite in high 

concentrations than the WT due to the importance of this gene in sulfite reduction. This 

interesting result tells us that dsrD is in fact related to sulfate/sulfite respiration, yet at which 

level and how that regulation is performed are still questions to be answered. Future work will 

focus on determining the ability of DsrD to interact with DNA in vitro, confirming therefore the 

regulatory function of this protein in the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway. It would also 

be interesting to analyze which genes substitute the function of dsrD allowing adaptation of 

the mutant strain to sulfate medium and also what is the actual contribution of these genes to 

the dissimilatory sulfate reduction.
