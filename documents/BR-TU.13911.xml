nuvens 3D, campanha TOGA-COARE.

resumo O  objectivo deste trabalho científico é  o estudo do transporte  vertical de momento 
linear horizontal (CMT) realizado por sistemas de nuvens de convecção profunda 
sobre o oceano tropical. Para realizar este estudo, foram utilizadas simulações 
tridimensionais produzidas por um modelo explícito de nuvens (CRM) para os quatro 
meses de duração da campanha observacional TOGA COARE que ocorreu sobre as 
águas quentes do Pacífico ocidental. O  estudo foca essencialmente as 
características estatísticas e à escala da nuvem do CMT durante  um episódio  de 
fortes ventos de oeste e durante um período  de tempo maior que incluí este evento 
de  convecção profunda. As distribuições verticais e  altitude-temporais de campos 
atmosféricos relacionados com o  CMT são avaliadas relativamente aos campos 
observacionais disponíveis, mostrando  um bom acordo com os resultados de 
estudos anteriores, confirmando assim a boa qualidade das primeiras e  fornecendo 
a confiança necessária para continuar a investigação. A sensibilidade do CMT em 
relação do  domínio espacial do  model é analisada, utilizando dois tipos de 
simulações tridimensionais produzidas por domínios horizontais de diferente 
dimensão, sugerindo que o CMT não depende da dimensão do domínio espacial 
horizontal escolhido para simular esta variável. A capacidade da parameterização do 
comprimento de mistura simular o CMT é testada, destacando as regiões 
troposféricas onde os fluxos de momento linear horizontal são no sentido do 
gradiente ou contra o gradiente. Os fluxos no sentido do  gradiente apresentam-se 
relacionados a uma fraca correlação entre os campos atmosféricos que caracterizam 
esta parameterização, sugerindo que as formulações dos fluxos de massa dentro da 
nuvem e o fenómeno de arrastamento do ar para dentro da nuvem devem ser 
revistos. A importância do ar saturado e não saturado para o  CMT é  estudada com o 
objectivo de alcançar um melhor entendimento acerca dos mecanismos físicos 
responsáveis pelo CMT. O  ar não saturado e saturado na forma de  correntes 
descendentes contribuem de forma determinante  para o CMT e deverão ser 
considerados em futuras parameterizações do CMT e da convecção em nuvens 
cumulus. Métodos de  agrupamento foram aplicados às contribuições do ar saturado 
e não saturado, analisando os campos da força de  flutuação e da velocidade vertical 
da partícula de ar, concluindo-se a presença de  ondas gravíticas internas como 
mecanismo  responsável pelo ar não saturado. A força do gradiente de pressão 
dentro da nuvem é também avaliada, utilizando para este efeito a fórmula teórica 
proposta por Gregory et al. (1997). Uma boa correlação entre esta força e o produto 
entre efeito de  cisalhamento do vento e a perturbação  da velocidade vertical é 
registada, principalmente para as correntes ascendentes dentro da nuvem durante o 
episódio de convecção profunda. No  entanto, o valor ideal para o coeficiente 
empírico c*, que caracteriza a influência da força do gradiente de pressão dentro da 
nuvem sobre a variação  vertical da velocidade horizontal dentro da nuvem, não é 
satisfatoriamente  alcançado. Bons resultados são alcançados através do teste  feito 
à aproximação do fluxo de massa proposta por Kershaw e Gregory (1997) para o 
cálculo  do  CMT total, revelando mais uma vez a importância do ar não  saturado para 
o CMT.

resolving model, TOGA-COARE campaign.

abstract The aim of the proposed research is the  investigation of vertical cumulus 
momentum transport (CMT) in tropical oceanic deep  convective cloud 
systems. Our approach is to use a unique four month three-dimensional cloud 
resolving model (CRM) simulations of TOGA COARE - a major field 
experiment over the warm waters of the west Pacific. Emphasis is given to the 
study of cumulus-scale characteristics of convective momentum transport 
during  the December westerly wind burst and a longer time interval 
encompassing this specific deep  convective event. The analysis of vertical and 
time-height distributions are evaluated against observations confirming the 
good quality and reliability of CRM simulations. Good agreement with previous 
studies is found. The CMT sensitivity to spatial domain size is analyzed  using 
two data sets produced by different horizontal domain sizes, suggesting  a non-
dependency of this field  upon the dimension of model spatial domain. The skill 
of the downgradient mixing-length parameterization is tested, highlighting the 
tropospheric regions where the momentum fluxes are downgradient and where 
they are upgradient. The  upgradient transports are linked to an unexpected 
poor correlation between the  fields involved in this parameterization, 
suggesting that formulations of updraft cloud mass flux and entrainment should 
be  revisited. The role of saturated and unsaturated drafts on CMT is 
investigated in an attempt to reach a better understanding  of their underlying 
physical mechanisms. The unsaturated  air via downdrafts, and the saturated 
downdrafts have an important contribution to CMT, and they must be 
considered in future CMT and cumulus convection parameterizations. Binning 
methods are applied  to these saturated and unsaturated  contributions, through 
the analysis of buoyancy force and  vertical velocity fields, suggesting the 
presence  of internal gravity waves driving the unsaturated air. The cloud 
pressure-gradient force is also evaluated using the theoretical formula 
proposed by Gregory et al. (1997), exhibiting a strong correlation to the 
product mean vertical shear by vertical velocity perturbation, especially in  
cumulus updrafts during the strong convective event. However, an optimal 
value for the empirical coefficient c*, which characterizes the role of the cloud 
pressure-gradient force on the vertical variation of cloud horizontal velocity, is 
not satisfactorily achieved. Good results are accomplished by Kershaw and 
Gregory (1997) proposed mass flux approximation to total CMT, which has a 
fairly good performance in parameterization the total CMT and in identifying 
the regions of greater variability. Testing this particular approach revealed once 
again the important role of unsaturated  air to the total CMT, which must be 
considered in future CMT and deep cumulus convection parameterizations.

Introduction

1.1  Objectives of the present research

 

 The role  of cumulus convection  in  the climate  system  is of great  importance,  

particularly  at  low  latitudes and in  summertime  over  midlatitude continents.  Cumulus 

convection  is a  primary  control  on  precipitation  and tropospheric latent  heating. Tropical 

convective  clouds systems generate two thirds of the global precipitation  and the 

associated  latent  heating  is a  principal driver  of the atmospheric  circulation.  Cumulus 

convection  also creates extensive clouds that  affect  earth’s radiation  budget,  and vertically 

fluxes heat,  moisture and  other  atmospheric  constituents throughout  the troposphere. It 

also induces vertical momentum fluxes, which will be the subject of this thesis.

 Cumulus convection  is a  subgrid scale  process; cumulus updrafts and downdrafts 

have width  on  the order  of 1  km,  much  smaller  than  a  climate model  horizontal grid 

spacing  of order  100  or  more km.  Thus cumulus convection  needs to be parameterized 

(that  is, its feedbacks with  the grid-scale variables need to be  represented in  the climate 

model),  which  has proved to be a  challenging  problem.  In  addition  to its interaction  with 

large-scale  circulations,  cumulus convection  interacts closely  with  other  small-scale 

processes such  as boundary-layer  turbulence,  cloud microphysics,  and land-surface 

heterogeneity (Figure 1.1), adding to the parameterization challenge.

 Most  of the vertical  transport  of air  within  the  tropical and subtropical  troposphere 

is accomplished  by  a  combination  of deep (heavily  precipitating)  and shallow  (lightly 

precipitating  or  nonprecipitating) cumulus convection.  Deep  and  shallow  cumulus 

convection  frequently  occurs in  environments of large  vertical wind shear. In  these 

environments, convective  updrafts can  have  a  systematically  different  horizontal  velocity

than  convective downdrafts,  resulting  in  a  net  vertical flux  of horizontal momentum,  or 

convective  momentum  transport  (hereafter  named by  CMT). Because  CMT  is caused by 

small-scale  updrafts and downdrafts,  its average effect  on  global space and timescales 

cannot be measured directly.   Hence,  the  effect  of CMT  on  the global  atmospheric 

circulation is still uncertain. 

 Studies of both  idealized (e.g. Houze 1973, Schneider  and Lindzen  1977),  and 

general  circulation  (e.g.  Zhang  and McFarlane 1995)  models have suggested  that  CMT  has 

a  important  effect  on  mean  zonal  winds in  the tropics and  may  also play  a  role  in  transient 

disturbances such  as the Madden-Julian  Oscillation  (MJO), although  few  reliable 

observations exist  over  regions large enough  to verify  these modelling  results.  For  these 

regions or  larger  scales,  CMT  can  be inferred from  an  observational radiosonde network 

using  a  budget  residual,  although  this involves considerable uncertainty  deriving  from  the 

need to estimate  the  synoptic-scale pressure gradient  force.  Using  this method,  Carr  and 

Bretherton, (2001)  and Lin  et  al. (2005)  showed over  the western  tropical Pacific, CMT 

tends to damp vertical  wind  shear  in  mean  zonal  winds or  transient  disturbances,  such  as 

the Madden-Julian  Oscillation  (MJO),  on  timescales of  5-10  days.  It  influences the 

tropical Hadley  Circulation,  rainfall  and surface winds across the tropics (e.g.  Richter  and 

Rasch, 2008).

 To represent  these  effects in  climate  models requires a  parameterization  of CMT.  

Diverse  parameterizations have been  proposed,  but  they  are inadequately  grounded in 

small-scale  observations and modeling.  The turbulent  transport  of momentum  is different 

than  for  atmospheric  constituents such  as heat  and  moisture because  due to pressure 

gradient  forces,  momentum  is not  conserved following  fluid  parcels even  in  the  absence of 

mixing.  Past  studies suggest  that even  the  sign  of the transport depends on  the degree  and 

geometry of the cloud organization.

 The major  goal  of this work  is to improve our  understanding  of the vertical 

transport  of  horizontal  momentum  by  deep convection  over  the  tropical oceans, using  a 

unique  four  month  three-dimensional  cloud-resolving  model  simulation  of TOGA-

COARE,  a  major  field experiment over  the warm  waters of the west  Pacific, characterized 

by  extended periods of strong  convection  in  strong  vertical wind shear  - ideal conditions 

for  CMT,  and extensive  radiossonde, aircraft,  and radar  data  sets which  provide a  good 

foundation  for  checking  the quality  of the  CRM simulation.  The author  will investigate the  

statistical and  the cumulus-scale characteristics of the  convective momentum  transport, 

examining  the signs of the vertical transport  of horizontal  momentum  during  strong 

convection  episodes,  the  sensitivity  of CMT  to grid resolution  and domain  size,  the 

contribution  from  saturated and  unsaturated  up-and-downdrafts to CMT,  and the 

accuracy of the physical assumptions made in some existing parameterizations of CMT.

 This dissertation  will be  structured  in  the  following  manner: Chapter  2  will 

briefly  describe  the  cloud-resolving  model used  and the  various TOGA-COARE 

simulations analyzed. In  Chapter  3,  the author  will  present  time series of the  most      

CMT-relevant  variables and the  comparison  of CMT  between  two simulations 

characterized by  different  spatial  domain  sizes.  Chapter  4  presents a  test  of the mass-flux 

approach  to parameterization  of CMT  and  evaluates the  contribution  of  saturated  and 

unsaturated up-and downdrafts to CMT.  In  Chapter  5,  the  author  will discuss the 

prediction  of U',  the perturbation  of the zonal  component  of the horizontal wind,  and will 

evaluate the contribution  of  the  pressure  gradient  force and  entrainment  terms for  this 

prediction,  assessing  the issues related to these  contributions.  A  direct comparison  with 

the Gregory  et  al.  (1997)  CMT  parameterization  scheme using  different  choices for  an 

adjustable   coefficient  called c* and   the deduction  of an  optimal  value  for  c*,  defines the 

last section  of Chapter  5.  Chapter  6  will  present  a  summary  of the results,  conclusions and 

directions for future work on the subject .

1.2  An Overview of Convective Momentum Transport

 The first  calculations using  scale analysis and  indirect  estimates of  vertical motion  

(e.g.  Charney  and  Eliassen  1964, Palmen  and  Newton,  1969),  suggested that  CMT  might 

be important  to both  steady  and  transient  flows.  Ooyama  (1971)  modelled  CMT  by 

assuming  that  momentum  was mixed  vertically  like other  scalars such  as heat  and 

moisture,  and suggested that  CMT  should act  to reduce the deep tropospheric  shear  in  the 

environment.  This transport  is referred  as downgradient  transport,  since momentum  is 

transported from  levels of high  momentum  to levels of low  momentum. Schneider  and 

Lindzen  (1976)  noted that  even  without  turbulent  mixing,  the momentum  of a  cloud parcel 

can  change  during  its ascent,  due to cloud-scale pressure  gradients produced  by  the 

relative horizontal  motion  of the cloud to its environment.  This opened the  possibility  that 

CMT  cloud act in  a  counter-gradient  sense,  that  is, to increase the vertical  shear.  

 During  the 1970s,  large-scale budget  studies provided the first substantial 

observational  determination  of CMT.  These  studies estimated momentum  flux 

convergence as the  residual  of a  horizontal  momentum  budget  over  an  array  of sounding 

stations.  This budget  included contributions from  large-scale  horizontal momentum 

advection  and storage,  from  Coriolis forces,  and  from  pressure gradient  forces.  The 

challenge  in  this approach  is that  the  residual term  is typically  much  smaller  than  the 

other  terms,  so small  uncertainties in  these  other  terms (especially  the  pressure grandient 

force) magnify  into big  uncertainties in  the  CMT.  Larger-scale budget  residual  studies, 

despite  uncertainties,  also suggest  mesoscale  convective  organization  impacts CMT. 

Momentum  budgets have been  constructed for  shallow  (e.g.  Holland and Rasmussen 

1973)  and  deep convection  (e.g. Stevens 1979, Wu  and Yanai 1994).  Stevens (1979) 

calculated  the  momentum  budget  in  easterly  waves over  the  tropical Atlantic Ocean,  in 

which  deep convection  was often  organized  in  north-south  oriented squall  lines.  In  the 

wave troughs,  where the  convection  was most  vigorous, the  author  found downgradient 

CMT  in  the along-line direction  with  little CMT  in  the across-line  direction,  an  anisotropy 

consistent  with  in-situ  observations of squall lines. The synoptic-scale pressure gradient 

force was a  major  uncertainty  in  this study. Wu  and Yanai (1994) examined mesoscale 

convective  systems observed by  storm- and  mesoscale  sounding  arrays in  Oklahoma  and 

Kansas.  Upper-tropospheric  environmental  wind shear  was reduced by  CMT  in  a 

mesoscale convective complex  case  and increased in  a  squall  line case, suggesting  once 

more the existence of a relationship between CMT and convective organization.

  Sui  and Yanai (1986) tried  to overcome the  uncertainties in  inferring  CMT  from  a  

1.2  An Overview of Convective Momentum Transport

26



momentum  budget  residual by  using  a  vorticity  budget  approach,  in  which  the pressure 

gradient  force  does not  appear. The  curl  of the  momentum  flux  convergence  is a  source of 

vorticity  which  can  be deduced as a  budget  residual,  but  this still  requires a  number  of 

assumptions about  conditions along  the  perimeter  of  the budget  domain  and  in  practice 

does little to decrease the uncertainty of the derived CMT.

 Direct  eddy-correlation  measurements made  by  aircrafts and  using  winds derived 

from  dual-Doppler  radar  analysis in  field campaigns contributed  significantly  to 

understanding  convective momentum  transport.  In  a  seminal observational study  of 

momentum  fluxes in  squall lines, LeMone  (1983)  showed that  in  the across-line direction, 

CMT  can  act  to increase the  environmental  wind  shear. The tilt  of the  updraft produced 

mesoscale horizontal  pressure gradients around  the  leading  edge  of the line  that 

accelerated the updrafts rearward and downdrafts forward. This pressure  distribution  was 

exactly  opposite  to that  predicted by  flow  around an  obstacle and suggests that  cumulus 

momentum  fluxes can  depend at  a  considerable  degree  in  the convective organization. 

Many  observational  (e.g.  LeMone et  al.  1984, Flatau  and Stevens 1987,  LeMone and 

Jorgenson  1991,  Gallus and Johnson  1992), and  modeling  (e.g.  Soong  and Tao 1984, 

Lafore et  al.  1988,  Gao et  al.  1990) studies have confirmed  the  existence  of 

countergradient  or  ugradient  momentum  fluxes in  organized systems,  of the sign  opposite 

that  predicted  by  mixing-length  theory. These studies suggest  that  depending  on  the 

vertical  profile of horizontal  wind U(z),  two-dimensional convection  in  the  atmosphere 

can  transport  U-momentum  either  up  or  down  the  vertical shear  gradient, with  the slope 

of the plane separating  the  leading-edge convection  from  the environment  perhaps a 

better  predictor  of U-transport  than  the preceding  environmental  wind profile  (the 

leading-edge is the intersection  of a  vertical  plane normal  to the convective line and the 

aforementioned plane).   When  the convective line is oriented  to minimize the U  shear 

(which  is frequent), the  evolution  of U profile is such  that the  U-momentum  is eventually 

countergradient.  

 It  has been  further  found (LeMone et  al.  1988a)  that  the  CMT  in  a  squall line is 

affected by  the  convection-induced perturbation  pressure gradient  resulting  from  the 

interaction  between  the  main  convective updraft  and strong  low  tropospheric  vertical 

shear  of horizontal  wind,  as studied by  Rotunno and Klemp (1982).  However,  in  a  3D 

numerical study  that  included  the neds of a  squall line,  Trier  at  al.  (1998)  found  that  the 

overall  cross-line CMT  was downgradient, even  though  was upgradient on  the mid-plane. 

The convective-scale  pressure perturbation  is weaker  in  a  low-shear  environment,  as 

observed by  LeMone  et  al.  (1988b).  Therefore,  nonsquall  mesoscale convective systems 

that develop in a low-shear environment are unlikely to have upgradient CMT.

mesoscale convective system. (From Moncrieff  1992, adapted from Houze  et al. 1989). (b) Schematic diagram 

of  the airflow  in  the  stationary  dynamical  model  showing the  three  flow  branches, namely  jump  updraught 

(A); downdraught (B); and overturning updraught (C), part of the archetypal model. (From Moncrieff 1992).

 Moncrieff (1992) developed an  archetypical  model which  allowed  for  

countergradient  transport  in  organized systems by  representing  the effects of mesoscale 

circulations and the  flow  in  the  across-line  direction  by  three  branches: a  descending 

downdraft,  jump updraft,  and overturning  updraft  (Figure  1.2).  It  is the  dynamics and 

thermodynamics of the jump  updraft  responsible for  the production  of much  of the 

countergradient  transport.  LeMone  and  Moncrieff (1993) found this model to be a  good 

representation  of  line-normal  CMT  for  quasi-two-dimensional convective bands, but  its 

implementation  as a  parameterization  of  CMT  in  global  models faces several challenges, 

e.g.: a)  the  closure  for  the  model  requires an  assumption  about  the orientation  of the 

convective  lines which  is not  verified by  observations,  and b) as Trier  et  al  (1998) study 

found,  local countergradient  transport   in  a  squall line often  does not  generalize   to larger 

space  and  timescales.  Most  current  CMT  parameterizations (e.  g. Gregory  1997,  Zhang  and 

Cho 1991)  are based  on  idealized models of flow  partly  entrained  into and partly  diverted 

around  an  isolated  cumulus updraft.  For  most  wind  profiles,  these  parameterizations tend 

to produce largely  downgradient  fluxes,  which  result  in  a  smoothing  of the environmental 

wind profile.

1.3 Convective Momentum Transport in TOGA-COARE 

observational campaign

 The Tropical Ocean-Global  Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response 

Experiment  (TOGA  COARE,  Webster  and  Lukas 1992)  provided an  attractive  opportunity 

to examine  reanalysis-based estimates of convective momentum  transport  (CMT).  The 

TOGA  COARE Intensive Observation  Period  (IOP)  took  place  over  the tropical western 

Pacific from  November  1st  1992  to February  28th  1993. During  this period soundings were 

launched every  six  hours at  four  stations on  the perimeter  of the IFA:  Kavieng  (-2.35N, 

150.48E), Kapingamarangi (1.04N,154.48E),  R/V  Kexue#1  (-4.00N,156.00E),  and R/V 

Shigan#3  (-2.00N,158.00E).  Soundings were also taken  at  a  more coarsely  spaced 

network  of surroundings stations.   Upper-air  sounding  stations were located at  the 

vertices of an  Intensive  Flux  Array  (IFA,  Figure 1.3),  and at  a  larger  Outer  Sounding  Array 

(OSA). Additional sounding stations were also scattered throughout the region.

 The vertical transport  of horizontal momentum  by  cumulus convection  was 

investigated  in  observations and model simulations of the Tropical Ocean  Global 

Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere  Response Experiment (TOGA  COARE). 

Estimates of CMT were obtained  from  radar  data,  momentum  budget  residuals, and  two-

dimensional  cloud-resolving  models and CMT  parameterizations.  During  the “active” 

periods of strong  deep  convection, there was often  strong,  deep vertical  wind  shear, 

lending  hope that  cumulus momentum  fluxes might  be sufficiently  large to reliably 

estimate from  a  budget  approach.  However,  Carr  and Bretherton  (2001) concluded that 

budget  estimates of CMT  were strongly  affected by  pressure-gradient uncertainties,  with 

no clearly  detectable  signature of CMT  above  850  mb.  Below  850  mb,  there was a 

tendency for downgradient transport. 

 Using  radar  data,  Houze  et  al.  (2000) concluded  that  the  nature  of mesoscale CMT  

during  COARE varied  with  the phase of  the  Madden-Julian  Oscillation.  Qualitatively, 

transport  of mid-level  momentum  by  mesoscale downdrafts appeared  to be downgradient 

during  the onset  of a  December  westerly  wind  burst,  but  countergradient  during  the 

period of strongest low-level westerlies.

 Tung  and  Yanai  (2002a  and 2002b) investigated the general  features of CMT  and 

analysed specific case  studies during  TOGA-COARE.  In  their  Part  I, using  sounding  data, 

taken  during  the IOP,  they  studied the CMT  effects through  the residual  of the  large-scale 

momentum  approach  and  concluded that  CMT exhibits a  profound transient  behavior, 

modulated by  the MJO and other  disturbances.  They  also noted that,  on  average,  the 

Chapter 1 - Introduction

29



vertical  momentum  transport  is downgradient.  Using  the  same approach  with  a  specific 

objective analysis (2002b),  they  investigated the CMT  associated with  several convective 

events during  TOGA-COARE. Their  findings confirmed the role of CMT  in  modulating  the 

large-scale  motions,  but  also suggested its role in  modulating  the multiscale interaction 

among  large-scale  waves of various periods.  Their  analysis is very  sensitive to their 

assumed pressure fields, which are quite uncertain, as Carr and Bretherton pointed out.

The  legends beneath  the  panels refer  to the symbols used to represent  the  observational  platforms. This map 

reprrsents the entire COARE domain. The  large-scale domain (LSD), the  outer  sounding array  (OSA) and the 

intensive flux array (IFA) are outlined. (From Webster and Lukas 1992).

 Zhang  and Wu  (2003), through  a  month-long  2D CRM simulation  of TOGA-

COARE convective systems using  the  observed large-scale forcing,  tried  to understand the 

role  of  the convection-induced  perturbation  pressure field in  the momentum  transport.  To 

quantify  the  performance of  the mass flux  approximation,  they  computed the  vertical 

profiles of the linear  regression  slopes at  each  level and  the correlation  coefficients 

between  the  pressure gradient  and the  product  of cloud mass flux  and vertical wind shear. 

The slope  was close to -0.4  in  the lower  troposphere and  slightly  larger  in  the upper

troposphere,  where they  were  forced to conclude  that  the value of 0.7  proposed  by  Gregory 

et  al. (1997)  was too large. They  also showed that  momentum  transport by  active 

convective  downdrafts is small  due to the  weak  downdraft  mass flux.  These  authors noted 

that  a  2D simulation, while more  computationally  affordable,  may  not  be  a  good 

approximation  for  deriving  CMT  and  pointed  out that,  long-term  simulation  with  a  3D 

CRM should be  the ultimate  approach  to investigate convective momentum  transport  in 

the future.

The Cloud-Resolving Model and TOGA-

COARE Simulations

2.1  The 3-dimensional cloud-resolving model

 Over  the last  decades,  cloud-resolving  models (CRMs)  have  been  widely  used  as a  

tool  to assist  in  the formulation  and  testing  of cloud  parameterization  schemes for  larger-

scale models.   There  are several advantages in  using  CRMs over  observational  data,  one of 

the most  important  is that  clouds are explicitly  represented.  Better  spatial  and  temporal 

resolution  is achieved. It  is assumed that CRMs are able  to represent  the  main  features of 

convective  storms correctly.  These models have some skill  in  simulating  a  wide variety  of 

cloud structures,  giving  some confidence  that  there  is value  in  using  these  data  to develop 

convective  parameterization  schemes for  use  in  large-scale models (Kershaw  and  Gregory, 

1997). 

 Cloud-resolving  models can  be used  to estimate  the momentum  transports by  deep 

convection,  for  different  flow  regimes and  cloud organizations. As well  as providing 

estimates of the net transport  of momentum,  the CRMs simulations provide details of the 

internal cloud-structure,  such  as the  variation  of horizontal wind with  height  within  cloud 

and the  structure and magnitude  of the cloud pressure-gradient  force  can  be  estimated 

directly.  Although  the  use  of CRMs to study  convective momentum  transport  has been 

increasing,  this use  has been  limited  to hours-long  simulations of individual convection 

cases, often  under  idealized initial  conditions,  with  the  exception  of Gray  (2000),  who 

computed the momentum  transport  by  mesoscale  convective systems over  a  6-day  period

in  TOGA-COARE. Two-dimensional  CRMs distort  the  air  flow  through  and around 

convective  clouds too much  to reliably  simulate convective mass transport,  often  leading 

to simulation  of squall-line organization  and  upgradient  convective  momentum  transport 

not observed  in  a  3-dimensional  CRM of the same  convective environment.  Like Zhang 

and Wu  (2003) stated  long-term  3D CRM simulations should be  used to investigate  CMT. 

Many  authors (e.g.  Moncrieff,  1992)  have stressed the  importance  of organized mesoscale 

circulations within  convective  storms,  which  may  require a  large  computational domain  to 

simulate.  Thus it  is important  to test  the sensitivity  of CRM-simulated CMT  to domain 

size.  

 The simulations available to perform  this study  were  provided by  the System  for  

Atmospheric Modeling  (SAM, Version  6.3), a  CRM developed by  Marat  Khairoutdinov  at 

Colorado State  University  and described in  detail in  Khairoutdinov  and Randall (2003). 

The model  solved non-hydrostatic  and anelastic equations for  a  3-dimensional, 

rectangular,  cartesian  horizontal  grid over  a  flat  and homogeneous surface.  SAM used a 

staggered C-grid,  in  which  divergence and  pressure are  calculated at  the  same  point  in 

order  to avoid  spurious oscillations in  the velocity  field.  Surface fluxes were  computed 

using  Monin-Obhukov  similarity  theory  from  specified  sea  surface temperatures (SSTs), 

wind  speed,  humidity  and  temperature  at  the first  model  level  above the surface.  The CRM 

predicted  the  time  variation  of the  three velocity  components u,  v  and w,  pressure  p, and 

the three thermodynamic variables, liquid-ice  static  energy  sli, total non-precipitating 

water  (vapor/cloud) qt,  and precipitating  water  qr.  sli and qt were adiabatically  conserved 

even  during  vapor/liquid phase  transitions but  had sources due to the formation   and 

evaporation  of  precipitation. The thermodynamic  variables were  transported  with  a 

monotonic advection  scheme to prevent  unphysical  states associated with  spurious 

oscillations.

 The model  used a  single-moment  bulk  microphysical parameterization.  Liquid–ice 

static  energy  was defined as sli = CpT + gz  - Lcqliq - Lsqice ,  where Cp  is the specific  heat of 

dry  air  at  constant  pressure,  T is the absolute temperature (in  Kelvin),  g is the 

gravitational  constant, qliq is the  mass mixing  ratio of  liquid phase hydrometeors,  qice is the 

mass mixing  ratio of ice  phase hydrometeors,  and Lc and Ls are the  latent  heats of 

condensation  and sublimation,  respectively.  A  diagnostic relationship  based on 

temperature was used  to differentiate the  phases of non-precipitating  hydrometeors 

(cloud  liquid water  and  cloud ice) and precipitating  hydrometeors (rain,  snow  and 

graupel).  Cloud  ice had  a  non-zero terminal  velocity  that  depended  on  cloud  ice water 

content  and was derived from  observations in  Heymsfield (2003).  A  Smagorinsky-Lilly 

parameterization  of subgrid turbulence (Smagorinsky  1963) was employed. No planetary 

boundary  layer  scheme, such  as those used in  global  climate or  weather  models,  was used

for vertical diffusion. 

 The CRM used  three types of thermodynamic  forcings: volumetric  forcings (large-

scale horizontal  advection  of sensible  energy  and  moisture),  surface  forcings (either 

prescribed surface latent  and  sensible  heat  fluxes,  or  a  prescribed  sea  surface temperature 

along  with  sea  surface  pressure) and a  mean  vertical  velocity  Wls (detailed  description  in 

Blossey  et  al,  2008).  The CRM radiation  scheme  was adapted from  version  3  of  the  CAM 

(Community  Atmosphere Model, a  global  climate  model  - GCM - from  NCAR,  the National 

Center  for  Atmospheric Research) provided for  the CRM.  Longwave and  shortwave 

radiative  heating  rates transfer  were computed in  each  model grid column  approximately 

every  three minutes.  Water  vapor,  liquid water  and the cloud ice (but  not  precipitating 

hydrometeors) were all radiative active. 

 Periodic boundary  conditions were applied in  the horizontal directions,  and a  rigid 

lid boundary  condition  was used  at  the  top of the domain.  The  model  vertical grid (in 

height  coordinates) was composed  of 96  layers, from  surface to 30  km  height,  with  grid 

spacings that  increase  smoothly  from  75  m  at  the  surface to a  nearly  uniform  spacing  of 

250  m  through  the  troposphere  and then  to 1  km  in  the  Newtonian  damping  region,  or 

sponge-region,  in  the  top 30%  of the  model  vertical domain,  which  prevented  the 

reflection  of upward-propagating  gravity  waves disturbances.  In  this damping  region, 

perturbations of all prognostic variables from  their  horizontal  mean  were damped on  a 

timescale that  varies from  two hours at  19  km  to two minutes at  the top of the  domain. In 

the top two model layers,  the mean  thermodynamic  profiles were nudged to specified 

observationally-derived profiles with a relaxation time scale of one hour. 

 The CRM generated two types of outputs,  The  first  type, 3D outputs were 

instantaneous three-dimensional  fields of basic  model  variables,  including  pressure 

(mbar),  zonal wind component  (m/s),  meridional  wind  component  (m/s), vertical  wind 

component  (m/s),  pressure perturbation  (Pa),  radiative  heating  rate (K/day),  absolute 

temperature (K),  water  vapor  mixing  ratio (g/kg),  non-precipitating  condensate  (water 

plus ice)  mixing  ratio (g/kg)  and precipitating  water  (rain  plus snow)  (g/kg).  The second 

type,  2D/1D (referred  hereafter  as “statistics”) included  horizontally-averaged variables 

and derived  quantities such  as vertical fluxes that  were  calculated  within  the CRM each 

time step, time-averaged and output periodically at a similar frequency as the 3D fields.

2.2.  Description of TOGA-COARE CRM simulations

 TOGA-COARE provided  an  excellent  opportunity  to investigate the  convective 

momentum  transport  using  cloud-resolving  models, since,  like previous observational 

campaigns,  it  collected large  datasets from  radiosonde,  radar  and  aircraft  instruments, 

some of which  during  strong  convection  events within  substantial  vertical wind shear 

environments.

 Several CRM simulations,  forced with  TOGA-COARE data, using  different  choices 

of spatial  and temporal  domains,  were performed by  Dr.  Peter  Blossey  at  the  Department 

of Atmospheric Sciences of the University  of Washington.  The forcings that  provided  the 

context  of large-scale  simulations were  determined by  large-scale atmospheric  conditions 

over  approximately  (500  km)2 region  of the tropical west  pacific  Ocean  centered on  (2S, 

156W) during  the campaign  (Ciesielski  et al.,  2003).  The mean  horizontal  velocity  profiles 

in  the model  were nudged  to the observed, time-dependent  horizontal velocity  profiles on 

a  one-hour  timescale.  The  SST  and  profiles of large-scale vertical velocity   and  horizontal 

heat  and moisture advection  were prescribed following  Ciesielski  (2003). Convection  was 

initiated  by  a  small (0.01  K)  temperature  perturbation  at  each  grid  point  in  the first  five 

vertical  levels of the cloud-resolving  model.  The temperature profiles were provided  by 

TOGA-COARE soundings and derived  from  them  in  order  to maintain  the  large-scale 

budget conditions. The surface moisture flux was computed interactively with the SSTs.

 The TOGA-COARE simulations available to perform  this research  work  employed 

three different  domain  sizes:  64  x  64  points,  96  x  96  points and  256  x  256  points,  all  with  a 

resolution  of 1  km  in  order  to resolve  deep  convection  and allow  local parameterizations in 

the vertical to occur.  Table 1 summarizes these experiments. 

 It  is important  to mention  that  the 96  x  96  simulation  was only  available at  the end 

of this study,  and due to this reason,  most  of the calculations were made using  the  smaller 

domain  dataset,  64  x  64  km2.  Although  this domain  size compromises the  ability  to 

realistically  simulate  large mesoscale systems,  it  has little  effect  on  the  statistics of  the 

convective  cloud cover, as Blossey  et  al.(2008)  showed. However,  Blossey  et  al. (2008) did 

not investigate the sensitivity of CMT to the domain size.

 The simulations using  the smaller  spatial  domain  were archived for  two different  

periods: a  3-dimensional dataset  D64T10,  output  every  three hours for  a  10-day  period, 

and an  hourly  statistics dataset D64T120-S for  the whole 120-day  campaign  period, 

starting  on  November  1st, ,  1992,  and  ending  on  February  28th,  1993.  The 3D dataset for 

the 10-day  period,  contained  instantaneous gridded  values of fields described in  previous

section,  every  three hours.  A  simulation  using  a  larger  domain,  256  x  256  km2, covered  the 

single 10-day  period, from  December  16th to 25th,  1992.  The  three-dimensional data, 

referred as D256T10,  included the  same  atmospheric  fields as D64T10,  every  two hours; 

the corresponding statistics dataset, D256T10-S, was calculated hourly.

 Dr.  Peter  Blossey  performed three  more TOGA-COARE CRM simulations using  an  

intermediate spatial  domain  size: 96  x  96  km2 , for  the whole 120-days period,  generating: 

a)  a  3-dimensional dataset – D96T120, containing  the same atmospheric  fields as D64T10 

and D256T10,  every  four  hours;  b) a  2-dimensional dataset  – D96T120-2D, where  several 

atmospheric variables were hourly  vertically  averaged by  the model;  and  c)  a  statistics 

dataset  – D96T120-S,  including  hourly  time-series of spatial averaged atmospheric fields 

as in the simulation D64T120-S.  

 All  simulations described  above were identically  forced with  the prescribed time-

varying  vertical motion, horizontal  temperature and moisture advection, and relaxation  of 

the domain-mean wind profile to observations on a one-hour timescale.

General Features of 3D CRM Simulations 

of  TOGA-COARE

 This Chapter  explores the  vertical  structure  of convective momentum  transport  

vertical  behavior  and  its sensitivity  to spatial  resolution,  comparing  two 3-dimensional 

cloud-resolving  model  simulations of TOGA-COARE with  different  spatial  domain  sizes, 

for a common 10-day period, characterized by a strong convective event. 

3.1  Time Series of CMT-relevant variables

 The importance of the vertical transport  of horizontal  momentum  was recognized  

when  the  investigation  of the  physical  mechanisms underlying  convection  within  cumulus 

clouds revealed the  relative importance  of cloud-scale dynamics and  sub-cloud-scale 

turbulence as a  central  aspect  of convective  motions,  whether  these  motions were located 

in  low  or  mid-latitudes.  The signature of these  smaller  scale convective motions on  the 

larger-scale or  mean  atmospheric  circulations was first  investigated using  Reynolds 

averaging, as described  below. In  this approach,  the governing  equations (Equation  of 

Motion,  Equation  of State,  Thermodynamic  Equation,  Mass Continuity  and  Water 

Continuity)  are separated  into mean-variable equations where  the large-scale motions are 

identified and  treated,  and into perturbation  equations for  departures from  the  mean-

state.

 Following  Houze (1994),  Newton's second  law  of motion  governing  the motion  of 

air in the atmosphere, may be written in the form:

?

 is the  unit  vector  in  the height  direction  given  by  z,  and  u, v 

and w  are the individual wind  components.  ? is the three-dimensional gradient  operator 

and D/Dt represents the total  derivative,  which  is the time derivative following  an  air 

parcel.  The density  and  the pressure  of the  air  are represented by  ? and p,  respectively.  

The right-hand  side of (3.1)  represent  the four  forces acting  on  an  air  parcel: the pressure-

gradient  force,  the Coriolis, gravitational  and frictional  accelerations,  respectively.  The 

magnitude of the  gravitational acceleration  is given  by  g,  and  f is the Coriolis parameter 

given  by  2? sin?,  where ? is the angular  speed  of the earth's rotation  and  ?  is the 

latitude. Assuming  the hypothesis that  the large-scale environment  is usually  in 

hydrostatic  balance, the equation  of motion  (3.1) may  be written  in  a  more  convenient 

form  in  terms of  the deviations of pressure and density  from  a  hydrostatically  balanced 

reference state, whose properties vary  only  with  height. Denoting  this reference state by 

the subscript  o  and  the deviation  from  the reference state by  *,  the equation  (3.1)  is closely 

approximated by

Considering  air  motions in  terms of deviations from  an  average over  some arbitrary 

spatial  volume of air  (for  example,  a  grid volume in  a  numerical  model), any  atmospheric 

field is expressed as the sum of its average value and its deviation

When  the fields are  decomposed in  this way,  the basic  equations split  into two sets: the 

mean-variable  equations,  which  predict  the behavior  of the  mean  atmospheric fields or 

large  scales,  and  the  perturbation  equations,  which  predict  the  departure from  the mean 

state,  representing  the smaller  scales.  Applying  this method to the equation  (3.2),  it  yields

is the  three-dimensional  convergence  of the  eddy  flux  of momentum. It  may  be  regarded 

as an  effective force  associated with  the  eddy  motions of the air,  while the  fourth  term  on 

the right-hand side  of (3.5) is a  smaller-scale  molecular  friction  force.  The equation  for  the 

velocity  perturbation  is obtained subtracting  (3.5) from  (3.2).  Referring  to the  equation 

(3.6) and  to the  classical definition  of momentum, the  object  of this research  was defined 

as  

? u ' w'                                                               (3.7)

the vertical  transport of zonal  momentum  by  deep  convective clouds or,  in  an  abbreviate 

way,  the convective momentum  transport.  This work  is totally  focused on  the  vertical 

component  of CMT  ,  as seen  is (3.7),  rather  than  on  the horizontal  components since  the 

horizontal  accelerations associated  with  CMT  should be  much  smaller  than  its vertical 

accelerations.  Statistically, the  convection  varies very  slowly  in  the horizontal,  but  rapidly 

and strongly  in  the vertical.  In  fact, in  a  periodic  domain  there is no systematic  horizontal 

gradient of CMT.

 Throughout  time,  several parameterizations were  proposed to deal  with  the  effects 

of this mechanical  side of cumulus convection,  in  an  attempt  to assess the relative

importance of different  variables to the vertical  structure  of CMT  as well  as to understand 

the physical processes underlying  the vertical  transport  of zonal  momentum.  These 

parameterizations are divided into two main  groups:  the first  one relying  on  mixing-length 

theory, where the  vertical  wind shear  plays a  fundamental  role,  and  the  second group 

related  to the cloud mass flux  field  where  the  contributions from  convective  up and 

downdrafts are evaluated.

 This research  was initialized  by  surveying  and comparing  the available cloud-

resolving  model simulations,  namely  D64T10,  D64T120-S and D256T10-S  (refer  to Table 

2.1)  and  by  analyzing  CMT  during  strong  convective events.  We  anticipate  that strong 

CMT  will be favored  by  extensive deep convection  in  strong  vertical shear,  so we look  at 

surface  precipitation  (a  measure  of convective activity) and  the  vertical profile of zonal 

wind,  since  the strongest  winds in  this region  tend to be in  the zonal  (east-west) direction. 

Figure 3.1.1  presents the time  series of surface precipitation,  accumulated  hourly, for  the 

whole  period  of 120-days divided  into 10-day  sub-periods.  December  1992  was 

particularly  active with  two major  events,  one close  to the Julian  day  345  and  a  second one 

closed to Julian  day  360.  Figure  3.1.2  presents the rainfall for  the specific  11-day  period 

from  20th to 30th of  December  1992, highlighting  the second episode,  the greatest  one, on 

December  24th with  a  total  of approximately  80  mm/day.  This event  is also attractive 

because it is included in the 10-day large-domain simulations. 

 Figure 3.1.3  shows a  time-height  cross-section  of CRM-simulated zonal wind,  for  

the whole 120-day  period.  Since the mean  wind  in  the CRM is strongly  nudged to 

observations, this is almost identical to the observed zonal wind.

 From  a  climatological point  of view,  the tropical  western  Pacific lower  troposphere 

along  the equator  is usually  characterized by  the presence  of weak easterly  winds with 

speeds between  1  to 5  m/s (Peixoto and Oort,  1992). These easterlies are frequently 

disrupted  by  westerly  wind bursts (WWBs) occurring  on  intraseasonal timescales in  a 

combination  with  the Madden-Julian  Oscillation  (MJO; Madden  and  Julian, 1971, 1972) 

or  with  extratropical  interactions (Lin  and Johnson,  1996).  Below  10km,  Figure  3.1.3 

shows two prominent periods of strong  low-level westerlies,  commonly  designated as  

westerly  wind  bursts (WWBs). Intense upper-levels easterlies aloft  with  magnitudes 

exceeding  30  m/s occupied the  upper  troposphere through  most  of the IOP and  were 

modulated by the WWBs.

The first  WWB,  shown  in  detail  on  Figure  3.1.4,  from  mid-December  to early  January, 

starts to build  up near  the  surface  on  December  15th, gradually  increasing  in  magnitude 

and extending  upward to the  middle troposphere.  By  the  end of this episode,  the 

simulated  westerly  winds occupy  most of  the  troposphere,  reaching  approximately  12  km 

of height.  Maximum  westerlies with  speeds greater  than  17  m/s occurred at  low  levels, 

3.1  Time series of CMT-relevant variables

42



between  1.5  and 4  km  of height,  at  the beginning  of January.  For  the  first  WWB episode, 

the peak  upper-atmospheric  easterly  wind of 33  m/s is in  phase  with  the  maximum 

westerly  wind below.   This WWB ends in  mid-January, when  low-level  easterly  winds start 

to develop extending to mid-troposphere, and strong westerlies above, in upper-levels.

  The 2nd WWB event occurs at  early  February, initiating  from  the lower  

troposphere  and gradually  increasing  in  depth,  and  characterized by  smaller  wind 

magnitudes and a  shorter  duration.  Following  this WWB event,  the Australian  monsoon 

moves in  maintaining  the westerly  flow  below  6  km, from  mid-February  to the  end of the 

month  (Tung  and  Yanai,  2002a). Above 20  km,  in  the stratosphere, most  of the  IOP 

features very  strong  westerly  winds, a  signature  of the westerly  phase  of the quasi-biennial 

oscillation  (QBO)  (Lin  and Johnson, 1996).  All these  features are present  in  the  vertical 

profile  for  the IOP mean  zonal  wind,  Fig.  3.1.5.  The  low  troposphere features westerly 

winds extending  upward to 6  km  at  which  easterly  winds start  to dominate  the  middle  and 

upper  troposphere,  reaching  a  maximum  below  the tropopause,  at  the jet stream  level. 

Above 15 km westerlies dominate the vertical model domain.

of TOGA-COARE.

  The “Mixing-Length”  hypothesis was the  first  to suggest  a  simple  

relationship between  the CMT  and  the  vertical wind  shear.  It  became the basis of several 

CMT  parameterizations in  weather  and climate  models.  Mixing-length  theory  suggest  that 

as with  molecular  viscosity,  the momentum  flux  is given  by  ?Km (??/?z), where  K is a 

positive  eddy  exchange  coefficient  for  momentum  and  ? is the mean  zonal  wind.  The 

exchange coefficient  is the product  of a  lengthscale (a  typical large  eddy  size, perhaps 1-3 

km  for  deep  cumulus clouds)  and a  velocity  (the eddy  turnover  velocity,  which  one  could 

estimate as 1-5  m/s for  deep cumulus).  This approach  will always predict  downgradient 

momentum  flux  from  levels of  larger  zonal velocity  to levels of smaller  zonal  velocity. 

Thus, mixing  length  theory  predicts that  the vertical shear  would be  an  indicator  of 

regions of positive  or  negative convective momentum  transport.  The  IOP-mean 

environmental wind  shear  profile  in  Figure 3.1.6  would then  drive a  region  of positive 

momentum  flux  from  above the cloud base up to the upper  troposphere,  and two regions 

of negative momentum  flux  beneath  the cloud base and above the tropical  tropopause. 

This prediction will be tested using CRM-simulated CMT profiles later in this section.

Figure 3.1.6.  Vertical  profile  of  the vertical  wind shear  (hr-1) simulated by  the  D64T120-S dataset, averaged 

over the small domain and over TOGA-COARE IOP.

  The vertical  profile  of the vertical  wind shear,  in  Figure 3.1.6.,  averaged,  by  the  

model, over  the whole spatial domain  and over  the 120-days period (IOP),  shows two 

distinct  regions of vertical wind shear  within  the atmospheric  column.  Most  of the 

troposphere  is dominated by  negative values,  related  to the  variations of zonal  wind  signs: 

westerly  and easterly  phases, and at  15  km,  where  the  easterly  jet  stream  is located,  a 

rapidly  inversion  occurs starting  to increase  upward and  being  positive up to 25  km, in  the 

stratosphere,  where westerly  winds dominate.   In  Figure 3.1.7, positive  values of vertical 

wind  shear  dominate  the IOP,  with  a  few  exceptions coincident  with  the low-levels 

westerlies in  the first  60  days and the  upper-levels westerlies,  after  Jd 380.  The typical 

IOP-mean  zonal vertical wind shear  in  the troposphere has magnitude 10-3 (/s),  similar  to 

other  environments in  which  are in situ observations of CMT  (for  example, LeMone et  al., 

1984, 1988).

Figure 3.1.7.  Time series of  vertical  wind shear  (hr-1), given by  simulation  D64T120-S, averaged over  the  whole 

atmospheric column.

 A  time-height  of the prescribed vertical wind during  Julian  days 350-359  (Figure 

3.1.8.) shows nearly  continuous lower-tropospheric  mean  ascent  and two periods of deep 

ascent  on  Julian  days 355  and 358  reaching  up to 14  km  preceding  the  most  intense low-

level westerlies.  These periods correspond to the  strongest  deep convection  and  surface 

precipitation during the period. 

 The total  cloud mass flux  field  is intrinsically  related  to the  vertical  wind  field 

through  the  relationship Mc = ??cwc,  where  ? is the air  density, ?c is the cloud fractional 

area  and wc is the  average vertical velocity  in  cumulus clouds. The total  cloud mass has 

two major  contributions: from  updrafts Mu = ??uwu,  and  from  downdrafts Md = ??dwd , 

being  designated  by  convective  updraft  mass flux  and convective downdraft  mass flux, 

respectively.  The most  important  role of the updraft  and  downdraft  mass fluxes is that 

their  vertical  variations are directly  linked  to the rate  of entrainment and  detrainment at 

the cumulus cloud  boundaries,  and  entrainment  and detrainment  have a  significant  effect 

on  momentum  flux, being  one of the physical  mechanisms underlying  the vertical 

transport of horizontal momentum by deep convection.

 Since  the cloud mass flux  (Mc)  depend on  the total cloud fraction, which  helps to 

identify  the location  and  the  cloud  type simulated  by  the CRM,  the  later  will  be  analyzed 

first,  using  the  simulation  D64T120-S.  The  time  series for  the  total cloud fraction  and the 

fractional  area  of cloudy  updrafts,  model-spatial  averaged,  during  IOP are  present  in 

Figure 3.1.9.   In  this plot, several peaks of the total  cloud fraction  are shown,  the majority

in  phase with  the WWB events registered  during  IOP.   The  major  peak happens on  Jd  358, 

like the surface  precipitation  and  vertical  wind, at  the  onset  of the  most  intense WWB in 

TOGA-COARE.  More  than  15% of the  model  atmospheric column  was occupied by  clouds 

during  the  time  corresponding  to deep convective days and/or  WWB events initiated at 

the lower-levels or  mid-levels (Julian  day  380).  During  easterlies (lower-levels), less than 

5% of the column is occupied, consistent with observations.

Throughout  IOP,  the saturated  updraft  area  fraction  remains approximately  half of  the 

total cloud  fraction; the  remainder  of  the cloud is composed of saturated  downdrafts. 

Figure 3.1.10 highlights the similarity between the vertical structure of both fields.

Figure 3.1.10.  Vertical  profiles of  total  cloud area fraction  (solid line) and the  fractional  area of  cloudy  updrafts 

(dotted line), as simulated by D64T120-S, averaged over IOP: 120 days.

  Above 12  km, in  the stably-stratified tropopause  transition  layer, both  fields 

decrease  rapidly  up to 16  km  where no clouds are observed.  Since the vertical profiles are 

averaged over  the  whole TOGA-COARE period,  we conclude that  the IOP was dominated 

by  extensive  upper-layer  cirrus anvil  clouds.   In  a  30-day  2-D CRM TOGA-COARE study, 

Zhang  and  Wu  (2003,  hereafter  ZW03) found  similar  values for  the total cloud fraction  in 

the lower  troposphere,  but  the vertical structure of cloud  fraction  differed  greatly  from  our 

simulations.  This might  be due to dimensionality  or  a  their  use of a  different  ice 

microphysical treatment than ours.

 The simulation  D64T120-S  provides three different  cloud  mass flux  (kg/m2/s)  

fields: the updraft cloud mass flux  (McUP),  the  downdraft  saturated  cloud  mass flux 

(McDD) and their sum, the cloud mass flux (Mc).

(dotted line, kg/m2/s) and the  downdraft  cloud mass flux  (dashed line, kg/m2/s), given  by  D64T120-S, for  the 

TOGA-COARE IOP.

 The evolution, both  vertical and  temporal, of these atmospheric  variables is shown  

in  Figures 3.1.11  and 3.1.12.  As seen  from  Fig.  3.1.11.  the total cloud  mass flux  is positive 

throughout  the IOP,  but  very  low  in  magnitude,  due to strong  compensation  between 

McUP and McDD.  The time  evolution  of updraft  cloud mass flux,  McUP,  resembles that  of 

cloud area  fraction  (Figure  3.1.9),  suggesting  that  variations in  area  fraction  are more 

important than  those in  updraft  vertical  velocity.  Like  the  updraft  cloudy  area  fraction  and 

the total  cloud  area  fraction,  McUP and McDD peaks coincide with  the onset  of strong 

low-level  westerlies.  The strongest  peaks in  both  McUP and McDD are  on  Julian  day  358, 

consistent with the surface precipitation and vertical wind maxima.

 The vertical profiles of  IOP-averaged  Mc,  McUP and McDD,  in  Figure 3.1.12, show  

features analogous to those found  in  Fig.  3.1.11.  The guiding  signature  in  Mc  belongs to 

McUP,  but  this is strongly  compensated at  most  levels by  McDD.  Right  above  the surface 

Mc  registers a  minimum  value without  apparent  relationship to neither  McUP nor  McDD. 

This minimum  is located  within  the  boundary  layer  and it  is connected to a  minimum  in 

the mean  vertical  wind  within  the  downdraft  core, suggesting  the presence of unsaturated 

downdrafts, which  may  be  a  result  of evaporation  of precipitation  within  the downdraft,

underneath  the cloud  base. Mc has a  maximum  value around cloud base  associated  with 

shallow  cumulus clouds, decreasing  slowly  until  3  km  of height indicating  some 

detrainment  happening  at  these levels.  Above this height, Mc  slightly  increases 

(suggesting entrainment) until it reaches another maximum value around 11 km of height.

line) and downdraft  cloud mass flux  (dashed line), given  by  the D64T120-S dataset, averaged over  the  TOGA-

COARE IOP.

 The simulated cloud  mass flux  profiles are somewhat  different  than  those  obtained 

by  other  authors using  different large-scale  forcing  conditions,  for  instance  ZW03  and 

Gregory  et. al.  1997  (hereafter  GKI97).  In  their  tropical  case study,  GKI97  found that  their 

CRM-simulated McUP peaks at the cloud base,  but  unlike  in  Figure 3.1.12., it  declines 

throughout  the  troposphere.  ZW03, in  their  2D CRM study  of a  30-day  period  of  TOGA-

COARE,  also found a  maxima  in  McUP at  the  cloud  base,  decreasing  slowly  upward  to 4 

km, followed by a fast decline up to 14 km.

 We  conclude  this section  with  vertical  profiles (Figure  3.1.13)  of the vertical 

transport  of the  zonal  component  of horizontal  momentum  (magnitude of 10-2) and  mean 

3.1  Time series of CMT-relevant variables

zonal  wind,  as simulated by  D64T120-S,  averaged over  the spatial domain  and over  the 

IOP.  This momentum  flux  is due  to all  forms of motion,  including  unsaturated turbulence 

(important  near  the surface)  and gravity  waves, but  since  cumulus clouds are  the  main 

energy  source for  small-scale motions, we  will  use the  term  CMT  to describe the entire 

eddy  momentum  flux  horizontally  averaged across the computational domain. The mean 

zonal  wind  profile  is nearly  anticorrelated to the CMT  profile.  Up  to 5  km,  westerlies 

dominate and CMT  is negative. Between  6-20  km, easterly  winds and positive momentum 

fluxes dominate.  In  the stratosphere above 20  km,  CMT  is weak. The vertical profile of the 

mean  vertical  wind shear  (Fig. 3.1.6)  fails to identify  the  layer  of negative momentum 

fluxes below  6  km  and the  positive momentum  fluxes in  the  upper  levels.  This conclusion 

is at  apparent  odds with  the hypothesis of downgradient  transport  but  is in  agreement 

with  findings by  LeMone  (1983,1983  and 1988) and others.  However, to fully  test  the 

downgradient  transport  hypothesis, the  momentum  transport  must  be split  into cloudy 

updrafts and downdrafts and  unsaturated  motions,  and the time-dependent  evolutions of 

the flow must be considered. This subject will be further discussed on the next chapter.

3.2 Comparison between small and large spatial 

domains of simulation

 Kershaw  and Gregory  (1997,  hereafter  KG97) carried out some sensitivity  tests to 

aid  assessment  of the accuracy  of  their  cloud-model  results.  They  tested the effects of 

increasing  horizontal resolution,  of increasing  vertical resolution  in  the  boundary  layer, 

the sensitivity  to the  turbulence  parameterization  and  the effects of including  a 

representation  of the ice phase,  in  all  cloud-model simulations of  two particular  case 

studies, concerning  the horizontal  momentum  transports and all variables related to it. 

They  concluded that,  an  increase in  the domain  size has a  very  low  impact  on  simulations. 

None  of the experiments showed  any  sign  of  mesoscale or  two-dimensional organization 

of the convection  (such  as a  squall-line formation)  and the  momentum  transports were 

very  similar  in  all  simulations.   Nevertheless,  this influence  has not  been  properly 

explored when  cloud-model studies are concerned. The sensitivity  of several  CMT-relevant 

variables to the  CRM horizontal domain  size  is addressed  in  this section.  Two datasets are 

available  to perform  this analysis: D64T120-S  and  D256T10-S (for  more  information 

please refer  to Table 2.1),  the first for  a  smaller  domain  64  x  64  km2 in  the horizontal and 

the second for  a  larger  domain  size 256  x  256  km2,  both  with  the same horizontal grid-

spacing  of  1  km.  The larger  spatial  domain  simulations are available only  for  a  period of 10 

days, Jd 350:359 (Dec 16th to 25th , 1992).

 Figure 3.2.1  shows the surface  precipitation  time series obtained in  the small   and 

large  domain  simulations.  Overall,  these time  series are  very  similar,  both  showing  the 

three large convective episodes on  December  20th,  21st and 24th. Some differences are 

noteworthy.  The  large  spatial domain  simulation  D256T10-S starts to produce  rainfall 

only  at  the end of the  first  day  of simulation.  This is due to the  fact  that  D256T10-S  is 

initialized with  a  nearly  horizontally  homogeneous thermodynamic  state  at  the  Jd  350 

(December  16th), and a  spin-up period  of  nearly  a  day  is required to produce near-

equilibrium  statistics of cumulus convection  and rainfall;  thus we ignore the first  day  of 

simulation.   The small-domain  simulations have  noisier  rainfall  profiles because  they 

contain far less convective storms at each time.

 

3.2 Comparison between small and large spatial domains of simulation

54



 The mean  zonal wind and CMT  vertical profiles over  Jd 351-360  are shown  in  

Figure 3.2.2.  Because the  domain-mean  horizontal winds in  both  simulations are strongly 

nudged to the  observed IFA-mean  profiles,  they  are essentially  identical.  The time-mean 

CMT  is almost  identical  between  runs,  but  is slightly  less negative  in  the small-domain  run 

in  the lower  troposphere.  This agreement  suggests that  the 64  km  domain  is adequate  for 

simulating  the CMT  profile,  and that  mesoscale  circulations not  simulated  in  such  domain 

must  therefore  not  being  playing  a  dominant role  in  producing  CMT.  The right  panel in 

Figure 3.2.2  displays the vertical  profiles of the all  cloud mass fluxes available in 

D64T120-S and  D256T10-S CRM simulations. As seen  in  time  series of  rainfall  and CMT 

vertical  profiles, the McUP, Mc and  McDD vertical  behaviors are  very  much  alike, for  both 

simulations.  The  large spatial  domain  simulated magnitudes are lower  than  those for  the 

small domain  dataset,  except  for  the  total  cloud mass flux  (Mc),  where  the magnitude is 

slightly  superior,  due  to the fact  that  McUP and  McDD contributions are  also smoother, 

not emphasizing  the significant  changes of these  fields over  the vertical.  Nevertheless, the 

overall view suggest a good match between both simulations.

 Figure 3.2.3  exhibits the time and  vertical structure of total  Mc and CMT,  for  both  

horizontal  domains.  The  conclusions lead by  the vertical  profiles are also confirmed here,  

highlighting  the much  greater  small-domain  CMT  variability  over  time and  height. Once 

more, confidence that  the 120-day  small domain  run  is representative of a  larger  domain 

CRM simulation  even  though  the small domain  cannot  support  mesoscale organizations of 

more than 64 km wavelength is achieved. 

 The comparison  between  small and large domain  simulations will  continue to be 

discussed in Chapter 4.

Chapter 4

Mass-Flux Discretization of 

Convective Momentum Transport

 This chapter  discusses the  skill of the mass-flux  representation  of CMT  first  

proposed by  Schneider  and Lindzen  (1976,  hereafter  SL76).  It  investigates the  relative 

contributions to CMT  from  cumulus clouds,  in  the form  of saturated  updrafts and 

downdrafts, and  from  unsaturated air  in  the form  of downdrafts and vertically 

propagating gravity waves.

4.1 Testing the SL76 scheme

 Schneider  and  Lindzen  (1976)  noted  the failure  of eddy-diffusion  theory  to 

correctly  identify  regions where the momentum  transport  is upgradient,  since  the  theory 

only  predicts downgradient  momentum  transports (of opposite sign  to the vertical  shear) 

at  all levels.  They  instead proposed  a  linear  relationship in  which  the vertical transport  of 

horizontal  momentum  relates to the upward cloud mass flux  Mc and  to the difference 

between the mean horizontal wind (?) and the horizontal wind within the cloud (uc):

           ? ? u
'w'( )

c
= Mc U ? uc( )                                                  (4.1)            

Chapter 4 - Mass-Flux Discretization of COnvective Momentum Transport

59



This expression  is derived by  assuming  that  the  fractional  area  of transporting  clouds is 

much  less than  unity, and that  the  momentum  transport  is due  to upward motion  with 

cloud mass flux  Mc and  horizontal velocity  uc  and a  compensating  downward  cloud  mass 

flux  (-Mc)  in  the environment  where the horizontal velocity  is assumed to be  ?.  This type 

of representation  is called  a  mass-flux  parameterization  of CMT.  SL76  further  assumed 

that  uc at  all heights within  the cloud is equal  to the  environmental wind at  the cloud base 

(updrafts conserve their  horizontal momentum).  More recent  mass-flux  parameterizations 

of CMT  modify  the vertical profile  of  uc  to contributions from  entrainment  and  pressure 

drag, as we will later discuss.

 In  environments where  the vertical wind shear  does not  change too rapidly  with  

height  (often  a  good assumption  in  TOGA  COARE),  the difference (? - uc)  tends to be 

proportional to the mean  vertical wind shear,  with  a  proportionality  constant  that  depends 

on  the combined effect  of the perturbation  pressure gradient  force  on  saturated updrafts 

and the lateral  entrainment  rate into these same updrafts,  both  of which  tend to bring  uc  
closer to ?. Therefore, the equation (4.1) may be written as:

? ? u 'w'( )
c
= L Mc

?U
?Z                                                      (4.2)

where L represents the vertical mixing  length  scale (in  meters)  for  updraft  zonal  velocity 

perturbations associated with  entrainment  and horizontal pressure  gradient  accelerations. 

In  this case,  the mass-flux  approach  reduces to downgradient  momentum  transport  with 

eddy  viscosity  K  = Mc L. SL76’s scheme  is like assuming  the  mixing-length  at  each  height 

to equal  the  height  above the cumulus cloud  base. For  most  other  more modern  CMT 

schemes, L is comparable to an inverse lateral entrainment rate.

 To investigate  at  what  altitudes CRM-simulated cumulus convection  is acting  like  

an  effective eddy  viscosity,  equation  (4.2)  is used as the basis of a  linear  regression, where 

the predictor  is the  product  between  the  updrafts cloud mass flux  and the  vertical  wind 

shear  (hereafter  referred as X1), the convective momentum  transport  is the predictand 

(hereafter  referred  as X2) and  L is treated as an  unknown  to be estimated from  the CRM 

output  as the slope  of  the  linear  regression.  Two regions are  excluded  from  these 

calculations: the stratosphere (in  which  there  are no cumuli and hence  no CMT),  and the 

subcloud  boundary  layer  between  the surface  and  the 500 m  of height  because in  this layer 

the vertical  momentum  transport  is due to the  effect  of turbulent  eddies rather  than 

cumulus clouds.  The  troposphere is divided into three layers: the lower  troposphere 

(between  500m  and 3  km  of height),  the  middle troposphere (between  3  and 7  km  of 

height)  and finally  the  upper  troposphere  (from  7  to 16.7  km  of height).  The top of the 

4.1  Testing the SL76 scheme

60



upper  tropospheric  layer  is defined by  the  minimum  value of  the mean  absolute 

temperature, which  defines the transition  between  the  troposphere and the stratosphere. 

The time period analyzed  is the 10-day  period  from  Julian  days 350  to 359,  corresponding 

to December  16th  to 25th, 1992,  for  which  there  are both  small  and large-domain 

simulations. 

 We  anticipate that  (? - uc)  may  be  proportional to a  vertically  smoothed  vertical  

wind  shear  due  to the fact  that  the updraft  cannot respond  instantaneously  to the  vertical 

gradients of environmental  wind,  because it  must  be accelerated by  entrainment  and 

lateral  pressure forces. Hence,  four  different  smoothing  scales ?z  for  the vertical wind 

shear  are tested:  the actual model  vertical resolution  named the  “CRM ?z”,  ?z  = 1  km, ?z = 

1.5  km  and  ?z  = 3  km.  In  each  case,  the  smoothed shear  is computed  using  a  forward finite 

difference scheme  between  all  model  flux  levels within  the  height  range considered.  The 

model output used is from  the runs D64T120-S  and D256T10-S  (please  refer  to Table  2.1 

for more detailed information).

 The hourly  evolution  for  both  the predictor  (X1)  and the predictand (X2)  

quantities,  within  the  previously  designated tropospheric layers,  for  all four  choices of 

smoothing  scale  ?z  is investigated in  order  to extract  some information  about  the 

variability  of these fields. Figure 4.1.1  shows the hourly  time series for  the model regular 

vertical  grid  spacing.  The predictand X2 (CMT) presents the  greatest  variability  over  the 

10-day  period  of simulation, within  the  lower  and middle troposphere; the upper  layer 

does not show  much  CMT,  comparing  with  the other  two tropospheric  layers.  The lower 

troposphere  does not  exhibit  significant  variability  of CMT  (X2)  in  the  first  half of the time 

period;  the  second half is characterized  by  a  different  structure  with  a  couple of negative 

peaks.  These responses are  seen  within  the middle  and upper  layers where  the vertical 

gradient  of environmental  wind is stronger  and  the cloud updrafts are well established. 

The predictor  (X1)  shows significant  variations within  the  lower  and middle troposphere, 

with  smoother  variations in  the upper  troposphere. In  the  lower  layer,  the  first  half of the 

10-day  period  shows almost no variations, and the second  half shows positive and negative 

peaks; similar  structure  is found  in  the mid troposphere.  The vertical  profile  of updraft 

cloud mass flux  McUP (Fig.  3.1.12)  averaged over  this period of time exhibits two maxima 

within  these two layers,  and its vertical  variation  suggests a  significant  entrainment 

signature in  these tropospheric  regions; the  vertical wind shear  also varies significantly 

within  these layers,  explaining  the  predictor  perturbations seen  below  7  km  of height. 

Above this height, McUP decreases almost  monotonically,  influencing  most the temporal 

structure within  the upper  tropospheric  layer.  For  the whole troposphere,  both  X1 and  X2 

exhibit  stronger  variability  in  the second  half of the  10-day  period when  strong  convective 

precipitation, associated with this deep convective episode, is registered.

 The small  and  large spatial  domain  simulations,  for  all tropospheric  layers and ?z   

considered,  produce similar  values of X1 and X2 over  the whole  period.  This similarity  is 

somewhat  kept  when  daily  time series are  computed. Daily  averaging  leads to a  much 

smoother  temporal  behavior,  removing  the noise from  both  X1 and X2,  as can  be seen  in 

Figure 4.1.2.

 We  note that  X1 and  X2  are one order  of magnitude  smaller  in  the upper  

troposphere  (i.e.  there  is much  less CMT)  than  in  the rest  of  the troposphere.  The  most 

prominent  features exhibited by  X1 and  X2 in  each  layer  during  the  10-day  simulations are 

reproduced  for  all  four  choices of smoothing  depth  ?z, with  some slight  variations in  their 

magnitudes visible in  the  hourly  and daily  time series.  This suggests that  changing  the

vertical  grid spacing  within  the troposphere (planetary  boundary  layer  and  stratosphere 

excluded) does not mask the important variations of both X1 and X2 throughout time. 

 The linear  regression  applied to equation  (4.2) reveals the  skill of a  downgradient

data sets, D64T120-S and D256T10-S.

 The lower  troposphere (Fig.  4.1.3) reveals low  correlation  coefficients for  the first  

two ?z  tested,  implying  that  the predictor  is not  the CMT  main  driving  force at  these  levels 

for  those vertical scales,  and suggesting  that  CMT  is carried out  by  the subgrid turbulence 

scheme, since  McUP doesn’t have  a  significant  signature at  these levels. For  ?z  = 1.5  and  3 

km,  the linear  fit  improves considerably,  with  a  much  less spread of values,  greater  than 

80% for  both  spatial domain  data  sets.  These results indicate that  the predictor  is doing  a 

good job  in  predicting  CMT, that  is, a  good  simulation  of X1 results in  a  more reliable CMT 

field within  this region.  The slope given  by  the linear  regression  are  all  positive  within  this 

layer,  which  means that  lower  troposphere is dominated  by  downgradient  zonal 

momentum fluxes, for all vertical length studied.

 The middle troposphere (Fig.  4.1.4) is the layer  with  the  weakest  linear  fit.  X1 and -

X2  are only  weakly  correlated  for  all ?z   tested, except  for  a  stronger  positive correlation 

for  ?z  = 1.5  and 3  km  in  the small-domain  simulation.  Within  the  mid-levels,  the McUp 

field and the vertical  wind shear  both  vary  considerably  during  the  10-day  simulation,  so 

the lack of  correlation  is noteworthy.  The slope values (Table 4.1)  are not  always positive, 

mainly  for  the  small vertical scales,  indicating  the presence of upgradient  momentum 

fluxes at  specific  heights.  The failure of downgradient  diffusion  to reproduce the 

midtropospheric  CMT  shows that  a  more sophisticated mass-flux  scheme  is required for 

CMT parameterization.

 Results for  the  upper  troposphere (Fig.  4.1.5) exhibits very  close  similarity  between  

both  spatial domains,  and  correlation  coefficients are  very  close  to each  other  for  ?z  of 1 

km  or  larger.  The vertical scales of 1.5  and  3  km  are  the ones presenting  the  best  linear  fit 

between  X1 and -X2,  as in  the lower  troposphere,  although  the correlation  coefficients 

values are  slightly  smaller. The implied  mixing-length  scale is 250-450  m  depending  on 

?z.  This is much  smaller  than  the prediction  of SL76  (which  would be around  10  km), 

showing  that the  horizontal  momentum  in  the updraft  is greatly  modified by  entrainment 

and pressure gradient forces as it  rises from  cloud base.  Reflecting  upon  the  values 

displayed in  Table 4.1  having  in  mind the  regions of strongest  correlation,  a  vertical  grid 

resolution  of 1  or  1.5  km  (3  km  would be a  somewhat  coarse resolution) might  be  the 

appropriate choice for  validating  SL76  scheme,  reducing  the  signature of turbulent  (sub-

grid scale) fluxes in  the resolved CMT.  The 3D-CRM vertical mixing-length  scales are in

relationship between  the  fields.  The  upper  troposphere  still  continue  to exhibit  a  good

4.2.  The relative CMT contributions from saturated 

and unsaturated air

 To analyze  cumulus convection,  it  is useful to separate  the contributions to vertical 

transports from  saturated  air  (air  within  the clouds)  and unsaturated air  (air  outside or 

between  clouds,  or  free air)  because  these can  have different  underlying  mechanisms.  The 

core assumption  made in  all CMT  parameterizations is that  CMT  mainly  occurs within 

vigorous cumulus cloud updrafts and downdrafts, i.e., CMT  is dominated  by  large 

horizontal  velocity  anomalies in  the  cumuli. Unsaturated  updrafts and downdrafts are 

neglected. Furthermore,  it  is usually  assumed that  cloud updrafts have a  much  stronger 

contribution  to CMT  than  saturated downdrafts. Our  3D-CRM simulations allow  us to test 

these simplifying assumptions.

 The first  step  of this analysis is the definition  of saturated  and unsaturated 

updrafts and downdrafts. Following  GKI97,  a  model  grid point  is defined  to be part  of a 

saturated  or  unsaturated  updraft,  strong  updraft, and  downdraft  when  the  conditions for 

QN and  W  given  in  Table 4.2  are  simultaneously  satisfied.  Our  analysis will  focus on  CMT 

during  the strong  convection  episode on  Julian  day  358  (December  24th,  1992).  This 

method uses the  D64T10  data  set, encompassing  eight  3-dimensional  CRM volumes per 

Julian day.

precipitating condensate (water  plus ice) mixing  ratio QN  (g/kg) and its vertical  velocity  W  (m/s) as defining 

characteristics.

 A  simple  observation  of the CMT  vertical  profiles generated  by  the different  

contributions of saturated and unsaturated air  reveals some important  results.  It  is 

4.2  The relative CMT contributions from saturated and unsaturated air

68



important to mention  that  the sum  of the  saturated and  unsaturated  portions of the 

spatial domains equals the whole CRM spatial  domain,  therefore the  ‘CRM’ CMT  averaged 

over  the whole spatial  domain  is the sum  of the  CMT  generated by  the saturated air  (in  all 

its forms)  and by  the  unsaturated  air  (in  all  its forms).  In  the left  plot  of Figure 4.2.1  are 

the CMT  vertical profiles contributed  by  different  types of saturated air,  averaged over  the 

eight  sampling  times.  The SAT curve is the CMT  contributed by  all saturated grid points; 

the SUP vertical  profile defines the  CMT contributed  by  all saturated updrafts grid  points; 

the SSUP refers to the CMT  contributed by  all  strong  saturated  updrafts;  and  finally,  the 

SDN profile corresponds to the CMT contributed by the saturated downdraft grid points.

 While  we might  expect  the CMT  to be  dominated  by  the  contribution  of saturated 

updrafts and  downdrafts, this is not  true in  the  lower  troposphere.  There is a  CMT  peak 

below  5  km  of height  which  reflects similar  magnitude contributions from  saturated  and 

unsaturated motions.  The  saturated  contribution  comes mainly  from  updrafts,  and  about 

half this contribution  comes from  strong  updrafts. Above 5  km,  there  is a  CMT  maximum 

that  again  follows the  SAT  CMT  profile,  but  now  the  contribution  from  the  saturated 

updrafts is partly  cancelled  by  the saturated downdrafts.  Near  9  km  and  13  km 

respectively,  there  is a  CMT  minimum  and maximum,  each  dominated  by  the  saturated 

contribution. Once more,  the saturated downdrafts partly  cancel a  much  larger 

contribution  from  saturated updrafts.  Above 16  km  of height, above the  cumulus cloud 

layer, the CRM CMT is dominated by unsaturated air.

 In  the right  plot  of Fig.  4.2.1,  the  UNSAT  profile  refers to the  CMT  generated by  all 

unsaturated grid points,  the  UNSUP curve corresponds to the CMT  carried out  by  all 

unsaturated updrafts grid  points, the UNSSUP structure  defines the  CMT  obtained by 

selecting  the  strong  unsaturated updraft  grid points,  and finally  the  UNSDN regarding  the 

CMT  generated  by  all unsaturated  downdrafts,  averaged over  these  grid points and  over 

the 8  time steps. Throughout  the  troposphere,  the overall  CMT  (solid line)  is of greater 

magnitude than  the  unsaturated  contribution  to CMT.  The contribution  from  the 

unsaturated strong  updrafts is negligible, and the  unsaturated updraft  CMT  is weak  and 

localized within  7  and  15  km  of height,  presenting  a  very  different  vertical structure 

compared with  CRM CMT  and having  a  signature on  the  CMT  carried  out  by  the 

unsaturated air  as a  whole (UNSAT  curve). The UNSAT  CMT  owes most  of its vertical 

structure to unsaturated downdrafts which  are most  significant  below  7  km. Above 16  km, 

there are no clouds so all CMT is unsaturated.

 The CMT  contributions from  saturated and unsaturated air  have different  vertical 

profiles,  and the  unsaturated air  significantly  shapes the  CMT  profile within  the lower 

levels and above the  tropopause.  These  preliminary  results imply  that  CMT 

parameterizations need to consider the contribution from unsaturated air.

Chapter 4 - Mass-Flux Discretization of COnvective Momentum Transport

69



 To better  understand the  physical processes underlying  the relative CMT  

contributions from  cumulus clouds, in  the  form  of saturated   up- and downdrafts, and 

from  unsaturated air,  in  a  combination  of convective  downdrafts and  vertically 

propagating  gravity  waves,  a  vertical-velocity  binning  approach  is applied to the  3D small 

domain  hourly  data  set  for  Julian  day  358,  but  first  tested on  a  single 3D CRM volume. 

The binning  method shows in  more  detail the contributions to CMT  from  drafts of 

different  strengths.  A  binning  method  (as opposed to scatterplots,  for  example) is very 

helpful  because  the spatial correlations of horizontal  and vertical velocity  perturbations 

that  create CMT  are  relatively  weak,  0.1  or  less at many  vertical  levels,  and binning  filters 

out  most  of the  noise,  isolating  the correlated  part  of the variability  without  assuming  a 

particular  (e.g.  linear) structure for  this variability,   thereby  providing  clarification  of  the 

mechanisms involved  in  the CMT.  The  greatest advantage of this method is that  one can 

look  at  the subsets of the chosen  bins,  for  instance  strong  w’,  weak w’,  or  w’  &gt; 0,  and see 

the patterns that may  not  show  up clearly  in  the overall relationship  between  the variables 

in study.

line, left and right plots, respectively).

 After  optionally  separating  saturated and unsaturated air  at  each  level,  grid  points 

are binned by  vertical  velocity  w.  The bin  size (the number  of grid  points combined  in 

each  bin)  must  be chosen  large  enough  to isolate  the  desired CMT  signal,  yet small enough 

not to average drafts with  significantly  different  vertical velocities.  Four  bin  sizes are 

tested, composed of 512,  256,  128  and  64  elements.  For  each  w-bin, the bin-mean  zonal 

momentum  perturbation  u’ is computed. By  averaging  across the bins, the  saturated  CMT 

is estimated.  If this compares well to the  exact  saturated CMT  simulated  by  the model, 

little information  relevant  for  CMT has been  lost  by  binning.  The unsaturated  air  is treated 

similarly. 

 Figure 4.2.2  shows that  the binned CMT  vertical  profiles obtained using  all  four  bin  

sizes match  the full CMT  almost  perfectly.  Figures 4.2.3  and  4.2.4  show  this is also true for 

the saturated  and unsaturated  CMT  separately.  This indicate that  this approach  does not 

loose information about the overall structure of the CMT for any of the chosen bin sizes.

 Each  vertical  level  is analyzed  individually, and the correlation  coefficients between  

the bin-averaged  u’ and w’  are retrieved  as well  as the coefficient  of determination  (R2) 

which  is the correlation  coefficient  squared,  focusing  on  the vertical  levels where the 

coefficients are  stronger  (in  absolute value)  and in  the levels in  which  the CRM CMT  and 

the CRM CMT  carried out  by  saturated and unsaturated  air  peak or  have a  significant 

signature.  The P-value  statistical  test  is applied  to each  level  in  order  to extract 

information  whether  is relationship  between  the fields is statistically  significant  or  not. 

For  this test  we  consider  95%  and  99%   confidence  levels.  The  vertical profiles of the 

unbinned  correlation  coefficient  values between  u’  and w’ correlations range  from  o to 

20%  (in  absolute value) throughout  most  of  the  troposphere. Because  of the large  sample 

size  (the 256x256  grid  points at  each  level),  even  such  small correlations can  be 

statistically  significant.  However, this behavior  suggests that the relationship between  u’ 

and w’  can  be more clearly  seen  using  binning, which  averaged across some  of  the noise in 

their relationship. Close to the stratosphere, this correlation becomes larger, around 60%. 

 Binning  u’  and w’, without  partitioning  into saturated  and  unsaturated air,  exposes 

different  relationships between  the  bin-averages of  these  atmospheric  fields at  different 

altitudes.  Figure  4.2.5  shows the binned  analysis at  four  representative  altitudes for  all 

considered  bin  sizes.  Below  5  km  (Z23  in  Fig.  4.2.5), such  that  negative  zonal wind 

perturbations are associated with  updrafts and  positive zonal wind  perturbations tend to 

be downdraft-related to yield  a  strong  linear  anticorrelation  and a  downward CMT. At 

higher  altitudes,  a  C-shape relationship  between  binned  u’ and  w’ is seen  in  most  plots 

present  in  Fig. 4.2.5, in  which  both  strong  updrafts and strong  downdrafts have similar  u’, 

while  bins with  near-zero w‘  have u‘  of the opposite  sign  and  much  smaller  magnitude. 

This is true for  the  vertical  levels with  maximum  positive values of CMT  (Z35  at  6.625  km

and Z62  at 13.375  km)  and  at  vertical  levels with  strong  negative values of CMT  (Z23  at 

3.625  km  and  Z45  at  9.125  km). A  bin  size  of  256  seems to be  enough  to remove most  of 

the noise and still  resolves  this C-shape relationship well,  so we  use this bin  size for  our 

remaining analysis.

obtained by  the bin  sizes of  512 (dashed line), 256 (dashed-dotted line) and 128 (dotted line) elements, for 

Julian day 358.

 We  next  apply  the  binning  approach  separately  to the saturated and unsaturated u’ 

and w’.  The  vertical distribution  of correlation  coefficients between  binned  saturated and 

unsaturated u’ and  w’  show  some contrasting  structures ,  especially  in  mid and  upper 

levels.   From  the surface up to 5  km,  the  correlation  between  binned  fields is strongly 

negative for  saturated  air  and  less strongly  negative  for  unsaturated air,  as can  be 

observed for  level  Z23  (3.625  km)  in  Fig.  4.2.6. These levels feature mostly  linear 

relationships between  binned saturated and unsaturated  u’ and w’.  Similar  correlation 

coefficients values are registered between  8  and 10  km  of height  for  unsaturated air.  Above 

5  km  and  below  8  km  of height (e.g.  Z30),  a  C-curve with  little  linear  correlation  is 

observed for  saturated air; the  unsaturated binned  u’ and w’   also start to show  a  C-curve; 

their  linear  correlation  weakens but  continues to be negative.  The C-curve  structure

persists throughout  the  mid  to upper  troposphere in  both  saturated  and  unsaturated air. 

Above convection, the unsaturated  binned variables are strongly  positively  correlated 

between  15  and 18  km,  in  the  tropopause  region,  changing  to very  strong  negative 

correlations within the overlying stratosphere.

 The C-curve shape  is not  documented  in  TOGA-COARE literature,  either  for  

saturated  and  unsaturated drafts,  and it  deserves some reflection.  It  remains for  further 

analysis whether  this particular  characteristic is unique  for  this particular  deep  convective 

event. The C-shape  structure  dominates most  of the mid and  upper  levels of the 

troposphere.  It  indicates that updrafts and downdrafts,  both  saturated  and unsaturated, 

have momentum  perturbations of the  same sign, giving  canceling  contributions to CMT  at 

the same height.  This structure  could  arise  if we  think  of each  cumulus cloud and the air 

right  next  to it  as a  mixture of  saturated and unsaturated updrafts and downdrafts,  which 

interact  through  pressure gradient  forces avoid colliding  by  all  having  the  same horizontal 

velocity  at  each  height  in  each  cloud.  More  vigorous clouds develop both  stronger  updrafts 

and downdrafts and also have a stronger horizontal velocity perturbation across the entire

cloud.  This idea  still needs to be better  tested, but  highlights the complex  nature  of CMT, 

because updrafts and downdrafts are exchanging  momentum  with  each  other  within  the 

cloud,  not  just  with  the environment. This is different  than  the  assumptions made in  CMT 

parameterizations.

4.3.  Is the unsaturated CMT due to upward-

propagating gravity waves?

 An  important  question  for  parameterization  is whether  CMT  driven  by  unsaturated 

air  is mainly  (i) due  to activity  of internal  gravity  waves which  vertically  flux  momentum  in 

the stably  stratified air  between  clouds, (ii)  due to the  interaction  between  the 

environmental air  and cloudy  air  around the  cloud edges, or  (iii) simply  due to downdrafts 

in clear air further from vigorous cumulus clouds.

 Internal gravity  waves generated in  the troposphere through  various processes,  

such  as the  interaction  between  convection  and vertical wind shear,  can  play  a  vital  role in 

the transfer  of mean  horizontal  momentum  from  one layer  to another  layer  of the 

atmosphere (Prabhakaran  Nayar  and Sreeletha,  2003),  and especially  in  carrying 

momentum  fluxes from  the troposphere  into the  stratosphere.  In  order  to test  if internal 

gravity  waves are responsible  for  a  significant  fraction  of the unsaturated  CMT  in  this 

tropical deep  convective event,  the buoyancy  field is computed and w-binned.  Internal 

gravity  waves transport  momentum  upwards, but  not  buoyancy; therefore one might 

expect no correlation  between  the  binned fields of vertical velocity  perturbation  and 

buoyancy. However,  for  buoyancy-driven  updrafts and  downdrafts in  cumulus clouds and 

in  the  unsaturated air  around  their  edges,  one  might  expect  a  strong  positive  correlation 

between these two fields.

where g is the  gravitational  acceleration  (9.81  m/s2)  and Td is the density  temperature 

obtained using the expression:

where Td‘ is the deviation of the density temperature from its reference-state value.

 Figures 4.3.1  and 4.3.2  shows binned  buoyancy  for  the bin  size  of 256  elements,  for  

saturated  and unsaturated drafts at  specific  levels at  which  the  partitioned CMT  peaks, 

and one  particular  level  in  the stratosphere,  Z83  at  21  km  of height,  where only 

unsaturated air  is present.   For  comparison,  the  binned zonal velocity  perturbation  is also 

displayed in  same panels.  As expected for  buoyancy-driven  convection,  the saturated 

drafts (inside clouds) show  buoyancy  acceleration  strongly  positive correlated to w’ 

throughout  most  of the troposphere,  contrasting  with  the  noisy  nonlinear  C-shape 

relationship between  u’ and w’.  Above 15  km  of height,  at  the very  top  of  the  cumulus 

clouds, the  sign  of the  correlation  reverses, as one might  expect  for  cumulus drafts that 

have overshot  their  level  of neutral  buoyancy  so they  are  moving  upward  due to their 

inertia but have negative buoyancy.

 For  the unsaturated  air, the situation  is more  complex  and the presence of  internal 

gravity  waves isn’t  easy  to identify.  Below  15  km,  buoyancy  and  w’ are  much  more weakly 

correlated than  u’ and w’,  as can  be observed  from  Figures 4.3.1, 4.3.2  and 4.3.3,  as one 

would  expect  if gravity  waves were  responsible  for  much  of the  CMT.  Levels Z30,  Z35  and 

Z45  are good  examples of this behavior. Most  of the  binned By  - w’ correlations,  though 

weak,  are still  statistically  significant. Looking  into detail to some of  these  weak 

correlations,  we see  that  the  buoyancy  acceleration  is almost  zero for  all  w’ bins except  for 

strong updrafts.

4.3  Is the unsaturated CMT due to upward-propagating gravity waves?

82



 The unsaturated strong  drafts carry  some buoyancy  suggesting  that  the interaction  

between  environmental  air  and the air  inside  the cloud  is driving  these  drafts,  but  internal 

gravity  waves are  dominating  the  remain  w’  spectrum,  since it’s clear  that  buoyancy  is not 

the main  mechanism  driving  the unsaturated  air  for  most  levels inside  the cloud.  Above 20 

km  of height,  in  the stratosphere,  binned w’  is weak,  but  is clearly  anticorrelated  with 

buoyancy  as well  as u’. Furthermore,  the upward momentum  flux  become  gradually  less 

negative with  height  (Fig.  4.3.2).  This is consistent  with  momentum  transport  by  an 

upward-propagating  gravity  wave  that  is slightly  damped,  for  instance by  numerical 

diffusion  in  the CRM.  Kuang  and  Bretherton  (2004)  found such  gravity  wave  damping  is 

due  to our  use  of a  vertical grid  spacing  that  is too large  (roughly  500  m)  in  the 

stratosphere,  and  would  be  greatly  reduced  by  using  a  grid spacing  of 100  m  in  the 

stratosphere.  In  summary,  the  unsaturated CMT  is due to a  mixture of vertical  drafts near 

cumulus clouds edges and vertically propagating gravity waves.

Prediction of the Zonal Wind 

Perturbation in the Updrafts U’up

 This chapter  uses our  CRM data  sets to test  the prediction  of U'up (the difference 

between  the  zonal  wind  within  saturated  updrafts and  environmental wind, both  averaged 

over  the spatial domain)  using  a  theoretical  formula  proposed by  GKI97  that  includes 

contributions from the horizontal pressure gradient force and lateral entrainment.

 

5.1  Evaluating the role of the cloud pressure-gradient 

force

 In  the previous chapter,  we  showed that CMT  is mainly  caused by  motions within  

clouds, especially  saturated  updrafts,  although  momentum  fluxes in  unsaturated  air  due to 

gravity  waves also are significant  in  the lower  troposphere  and  in  the stratosphere. CMT 

parameterizations have focused on  the  contribution  of saturated  air,  and especially 

saturated  updrafts,  to CMT.  Among  such  parameterizations,  the  one proposed by  Kershaw 

and Gregory  (1997) is attractive  to compare  to the  3D CRM data  sets,  since it  clearly 

includes the roles of  horizontal pressure-gradient  force across the  updrafts and 

entrainment  processes in  the vertical  evolution  of the horizontal  velocity  in  the updrafts.  

 The cloud pressure-gradient term  is poorly  understood  theoretically,  so early  

efforts to formulate  CMT  parameterizations neglected this physical  mechanism  (for 

example,  Shapiro and  Stevens,  1980). Nevertheless,  observational  studies (Flatau  and 

Chapter 5 - Prediction of the Zonal Wind Perturbation in the Updrafts U’up

85



Stevens, 1987) and modeling  studies (e.g. Gregory  and Miller,  1989)  have indicated that 

the cloud pressure-gradient  force plays an  important  part  in  determining  the  variation  of 

horizontal  velocity  within  the cloud as a  parcel  ascends.  Kershaw  and Gregory  (1997) and 

GKI97,  proposed  that  the vertical  structure of the  updraft  horizontal  velocity  may  be 

written in the form:

dUup
dZ

= ? Uenv -Uup( ) + c* dUenvdZ                           (5.1)
where ?up,  ?env  are the mean  horizontal  velocity  in  the updrafts and  in  the  environment, 

respectively,  ? is a  bulk  fractional  lateral  updraft  entrainment  rate in  units of 1/km  and c*  

is an  nondimensional empirical  constant  (to be determined)  that  relates the cloud 

pressure-gradient  force to the  mean  vertical shear. Equation  (5.1)  can  be derived from 

considering  the force balance  on  a  control  volume in  a  representative quasi-steady 

cumulus updraft.  The left-hand side  of the equation  represents the  horizontal  momentum 

added to the  updraft  air  as it  rises through  the control volume, the  first  term  on  the right-

hand side is related to the  momentum  source  due  to lateral  entrainment  of air  into the 

updraft  and  the  second  term  on  the right-hand side is a  representation  of  the  cloud 

pressure-gradient  force,  which  will  be investigated in  this section.  Section  5.2  is dedicated 

to the investigation of the entrainment term in equation (5.1).

Analysis of the perturbation pressure gradient acceleration on updrafts

 A  relationship between  the  cloud pressure-gradient  force  and  the mean  vertical 

shear  was first  theoretically  derived by  Rotunno and Klemp  (1982)  who showed from  a 

linear  analysis that the pressure  perturbation  across an  isolated updraft  is related to the 

mean  shear  of the cloud  environment  and  the updraft  vertical velocity,  the perturbation 

being  parallel  to the  shear  and acting  to bring  the updraft velocity  back  toward the mean 

environmental wind  at  each  level. In  1988,  Le Mone et al.  in  their  observational  study 

confirmed  that  this relationship qualitatively  holds for  updrafts of deep convective clouds. 

Wu  and Yanai (1994) used Rotunno and  Klemp’s analysis to explain  CMT  in  organized 

mesoscale convective  systems over  Midwestern  USA,  and proposed a  parameterization  of  

the cloud pressure-gradient force using  updraft  cloud-mass flux, mean  vertical  shear,  and 

the orientation of the convective system to the shear. 

5.1  Evaluating the role of the cloud pressure-gradient force

86



 GKI97  proposed  a  simpler  formula  that  neglects the  convective  organization  and 

which is equivalent to assuming

PGFx = c
* w'

dUenv
dZ                                            (5.2)

where PGFx = ? 1/? ?p'/?x,  ? is the air  density  (kg/m3), p' is the pressure perturbation 
field (Pa)  and  w' is the vertical velocity  perturbation  (m/s).  In  their  study,  based  on  cloud-

resolving  model  simulations of a  cold-air  outbreak  and a  tropical  deep convection  case, 

they found that the optimal c* = 0.7. 

 The rest  of this section  describes a  similar  analysis of our  CRM data  set, which  is 

much  longer  and uses a  bigger  computational  domain  than  used  by  GKI97.  To accurately 

compute the cloud  pressure-gradient  force using  model  data,  we  take into account  the grid 

staggering  between  horizontal velocity  and pressure perturbation  fields. We  compare 

PGFx with  the right  hand  side of equation  (5.2)  at  each  level,  and  extract  the ideal  value for 

c*. We then  vertically  integrate equation  (5.1) to retrieve the  ?up for  each  level  of height 

and to compare  it  with  the  one simulated by  the  CRM and  with  the GKI97  scheme  (c* = 

0.7). 

 The ideal  c* is calculated applying  a  linear  regression  to equation  (5.2),  in  the  form  

of Y  = m  X,  where  Y  is horizontal  component  of the cloud pressure-gradient  force, the 

slope m  represents the  best value  for  c* and X is the  product  of the vertical  wind 

perturbation  by  the  mean  vertical  shear.  This linear  regression  is constrained  to go 

through  the  origin,  as GKI97  had postulated,  and is implemented  only  over  the  saturated 

updraft  grid  points.  The linear  regression  is then  performed over  the grid levels for  which 

the fractional area  covered  by  saturated updrafts is greater  than  1%.  A  separate  value  of c* 

is calculated  at  each  time averaged  over  each  of our  three  tropospheric  layers (please  refer 

to section  4.1,  Chapter  4, for  their  definition).  The saturated downdrafts are also examined 

in  an  attempt  to extend  the GKI97  scheme to cumulus downdrafts.  The pressure 

perturbation,  the vertical velocity  perturbation,  the environmental  wind,  and the 

horizontal  velocities within  the cumulus updrafts and  downdrafts are given  by  the  3D data 

set  D64T10;  the air  density  is given  by  the  statistics data  set D64T120-S.  The  time  average 

of PGFxsup and PGFxsdn is weighted by  the  total  number  of  saturated updraft  and  downdraft 

grid points,  respectively,  existing  in  every  time  step  analyzed.  Eight  3D volumes are 

analyzed for  every  Julian  day  considered.  The results are shown  first  for  the  Julian  day 

358  that  features vigorous deep  convection  and strong  wind shear,  and then  for  the 10-day 

period from Julian days (Jd) 350 to 359.

Julian Day 358

 In  Fig.  5.1.1.  the  vertical  profiles averaged over  the  entire day, as well  as time-

height  cross sections of the  zonal  wind perturbation  Up,  the  CMT,  and the  zonal 

component  of the cloud pressure-gradient  force  PGFx within  the saturated updrafts 

(sampled  every  three  hours)  are displayed.  The  time-mean  zonal  pressure-gradient  force 

is negative below  8  km, increasing  in  magnitude from  surface to 6  km  of height.  A  negative 

zonal  component  of the cloud pressure-gradient  implies that  the pressure tends to be 

higher  to the  east  than  to the  west  of a  typical  updraft,  which  would  tend  to accelerate the 

updraft  in  the negative (westward)  direction.  Above 5  km,  the PGFx accelerates the 

saturated  updrafts in  the  positive  (eastward)  direction.  At  some heights,  the PGFx is in  the 

same direction  as the  vertical  derivative of the updraft  zonal velocity  perturbations but  at 

other  levels it  is not,  so PGFx is not  the  only  mechanism  responsible for  the Up and CMT 

structures within  the saturated updrafts.  Similarly,  the time  evolution  of PGFx  shows a 

large  peak  in  the upper  troposphere  at  Jd385.4,  but  these features are  much  less visible in 

Up  and saturated updraft CMT.

 The vertical and temporal  aspects of saturated  downdrafts may  be  seen  in  Fig.  

5.1.2.  The  PGFx is rather  weak  except  close to the tropopause  near  midday  and  does not 

strong  resemble the saturated updraft  PGFx.  The binning  method applied  to saturated  up 

and downdrafts described fully  in  Chapter  4  indicated that  the cumulus drafts may  be 

controlled by  different  fluid dynamics; evaluating  the cloud  pressure-gradient  force 

separately points in the same direction.

 The vertical  profiles of the  fields involved  in  equation  (5.2)  are displayed  in  Fig.  

5.1.3,  for  both  cumulus up- and downdrafts.  Below  8  km,  the vertical wind shear  profile  is 

followed closely  by  the  PGFx vertical profile,  while  the  vertical  velocity  perturbation  is in 

the range  1.5  - 3  m  s-1.  In  the 10  - 14  km  layer, the  mean  vertical  wind  shear  is rather  weak 

and negative and  Wp  is 1  - 2  m  s-1,  whereas the  PGFx is positive,  counter  to the GKI97 

formula.  For  the saturated  downdrafts, the  scenario is considerably  different.  The  lower 

levels,  where saturated  downdrafts are  present  and  there  is some vertical wind  shear, do 

show  some  PGFx  variation,  especially  below  6  km.  The mid  and upper  levels display 

weaker  magnitudes of  PGFx than  in  the  saturated  updrafts with  significant  variability  in 

the profile  that  is hard to relate  to features in  Wp  or  in  VWS   vertical  profiles,  suggesting 

again a poor relationship between the two members of equation (5.2) in this region.

 ZW03  do not  show  any  vertical  profiles related  with  the variables involved in  (5.2)  

but they  mention  that  “  large positive  values of PGFx correspond  to strong  negative wind 

shear,  such  as that  in  the lower  and middle troposphere  on  24  December  (…). Similarly, 

negative pressure-gradient  appears where there is a  strong  positive  wind shear  “. This 

would  correspond to a  negative value  of c*,  opposite to the findings of GKI97.  In  our 

simulations,  these features are only  verified  in  the upper  troposphere for  saturated 

updrafts and  within  the 5  - 8  km  and  14  - 16  km  layers for  saturated downdrafts.  Hence, 

the results obtained by ZW03 are not entirely confirmed by our 3D data sets.

 GKI97  suggested based  on  their  results that  0.7  is an  optimal  value  for  c*,  for  both  

their  cold-air  outbreak  or  tropical  cases, and  for  both  saturated updrafts and downdrafts. 

As can  be seen  in  Figure 5.1.4,  the zonal pressure-gradient  force parameterization  using 

this c*  for  the  whole  troposphere  does not  always match  the PGFx  simulated  by  the  3D 

cloud-resolving  model.  Below  8  km,  within  the lower  and mid-troposphere, the 

parameterization  performs somewhat  reasonably  in  both  cumulus up-and-downdrafts. 

However,  within  most  of the  upper  troposphere, the  parameterized PGFx diverges 

significantly  and even  has the opposite  sign  from  the  CRM simulation,  especially  within 

cumulus updrafts.

 In  Figure 5.1.5,  we see that  the  agreement  is no better  for  other  reasonable  choices 

of c*,  except  for  smaller  c* values within  saturated downdrafts.  These results are consistent 

with ZW03’s conclusion that c* should not be the same for all heights.

line), averaged over  the  saturated updraft grid points (Left plot) and over  the saturated downdraft  grid points 

(Right plot), for Julian day 358. All the quantities are given by the 3D D64T10 simulation.

 In  the present  work,  the optimal c* is achieved by  applying  a  simple  linear  

regression  to equation  (5.2)  in  respect  to time,  for  each  tropospheric  layer,  constrained  to 

pass through  the origin,  treating  the  8  times steps at  which  we  have  3D volumes as 

independent  samples.  As in  Section  4.1,  the linear  regression  is applied to three 

tropospheric  layers,  and for  each  layer  the slope  of this line  corresponds to the best  c* for 

that  layer. Only  vertical levels within  that  layer  where  the fraction  of saturated updrafts or 

downdrafts is greater  than  1% are considered,  and both  sides of (5.2) are area-weighted by 

the total number of saturated updraft (downdraft)  Nsup ( Nsdn) grid points.

several  discrete  choices for  c*, averaged over  the  saturated updraft  (Left plot) and over  the saturated 

downdraft (Right plot) grid points, for  Julian day  358. All  the variables studied are given by  the 3D  D64T10 

simulation.

 Figure 5.1.6  presents the best-fit  slope  (c*)  for  saturated  updrafts (first  row)  and 

saturated  downdrafts (second  row) obtained from  applying  the linear  regression  to 

parameterization  (5.2)  within  the three layers of the troposphere.  For  the  cumulus 

updrafts,  both  sides of the  parameterization  are strongly  correlated in  time  (maximizing 

during  the strong  convective  event  near  12  UTC)  in  the upper  troposphere  only.  In  the 

middle  troposphere the estimated  slope is around 0.55,  while for  the  lower  and upper 

troposphere,  the respective slopes of -0.41  and -0.29  are negative.  These are  all  smaller 

than  the value  suggested by  GKI97, and in  two of the three cases of unexpected sign. 

However,  these  results are in  good  agreement  with  those  found by  ZW03  in  their  2D CRM 

TOGA-COARE study,  except  in  the upper-levels,  where ZW03  obtained larger  slope 

values.  There  are too few  cumulus downdrafts in  the lower  tropospheric  region  to allow  a 

real conclusion  about  c*.  In  mid  and upper  level saturated downdrafts,  there  is more mass 

flux  but  the  estimated slope  values are very  small in  the upper  troposphere  and  -0.4  in  the 

mid levels and there is no correlation  between  the quantities analyzed,  again  contradicting 

GKI97’s results.

parameterization  of the pressure-gradient  force on  saturated updrafts and downdrafts, at 

least for this specific case during this particular time window of one day.

 Inside of cumulus updrafts,  the 10-day  mean  PGFx  is negative from  2  km  to 8  km  

of height  and  is positive beyond  that  altitude,  showing  a  qualitatively  similar  time-mean 

vertical  structure (averaged over  spatial and  time  domains) compared with  the one for  Jd 

358  shown  in  the  lower  left  of Fig.  5.1.1,  but  weighted  toward  the levels of maximum 

fractional  area  covered  by  saturated  updrafts.  Therefore, the 10-day  mean  PGFx  and the 

zonal  wind perturbation  profiles show  a  clear  correlation  with  the  corresponding  Jd358 

vertical  profiles. The zonal  wind  perturbation  (Fig.  5.1.7  top)  strongly  shapes the CMT 

profile  (Fig.  5.1.7  middle), both  in  the 10-day  mean  (left  panels)  and the  time-height

evolution  (right panels).  For  saturated  downdrafts (Fig.  5.1.8),  the conclusions from 

JD358  are also valid for  the  10-day  period,  because the  strong  convective event  dominates 

the time-mean vertical profiles of CMT and PGFx.

from 3D D64T10 simulation.

 Figure 5.1.9  shows the 10-day  mean  vertical  profiles of the quantities involved  in  

GKI97’s parameterization  (5.2) for  PGFx. The results resemble those of the 1-day  period 

shown  in  Fig. 5.1.3,  since  the  strong  deep  convective  event  has a  remarkable signature on 

the time-mean  vertical  profiles for  this larger  period  of time,  except  in  the upper 

troposphere for PGFx in both cumulus drafts.

 Figure 5.1.10  displays the  corresponding  vertical  distributions of the  two members 

of equation  (5.2) for  GKI97’s recommended  value c*= 0.7  for  both  cumulus up-and 

downdrafts. As for  Jd358, GKI97’s approach  simulates the 10-day  area-weighted PGFx  
quite poorly.

line), averaged over  the  saturated updraft grid points (Left plot) and over  the saturated downdraft  grid points 

(Right plot), for the time period Jd 350:359. All the variables studied are given by the 3D D64T10 data set.

 Following  exactly  the same procedure  as for  Julian  day  358, linear  regression  over  

the 3hr-mean  samples,  for  the  10-day  period, averaged across the  three tropospheric 

layers is performed on  equation  (5.2),  estimating  the  best  c* value for  each  layer  as the 

slope of the regression  line (Figure 5.1.11). Compared to the  Jd358  cumulus updraft 

results,  the  c* is smaller  in  magnitude within  the lower  and  middle  troposphere but  in  the 

same range  in  the upper  troposphere,  and like for  Jd358,  the  estimated c* is positive  only 

in  the mid-troposphere.  For  the  cumulus downdrafts,  there is too little mass flux  in  the 

lower  and mid-troposphere to meaningfully  estimate c*,  but  in  the  middle troposphere the 

estimated c*  is less than  half of the one predicted for  Jd358. Thus the Jd358  results, which 

contradict  GKI97,  also apply  to the  full  10-day  simulation.  The correlation  among  the 

variables involved  in  eqn  (5.2) is still  identifiable but  smaller  for  saturated  updrafts, in  all 

tropospheric  layers considered,  compared  with  those for  Jd358.  The  saturated  downdrafts 

don’t  show  any  correlation  at  all.  These results suggest  that,  for  longer  periods of time that 

include  deep  convective  events,  especially  within  cumulus updrafts,  we  still  have  both 

members of equation  (5.2)  somehow  correlated with  each  other, and the  optimal  c*  still  is 

in an acceptable range of values.

simulation.

5.2.  The prediction of cumulus updraft zonal velocity  

perturbation

 To compute  the saturated  updraft  CMT  using  the mass flux  approximation, we 

need ?env - ?up, which  we calculate by  vertically  integrating  equation  (5.1) for  the updraft 

zonal  momentum. Section  5.1  explored  the  second term  on  the right-hand side (hereafter 

RHS)  of (5.1),  which  parameterizes the  pressure-gradient  force on  the updraft; we now 

briefly  discuss the  first  ‘entrainment’ term  on  the RHS  of (5.1)  and  then  compare 

Chapter 5 - Prediction of the Zonal Wind Perturbation in the Updrafts U’up

99



predictions from (5.1) with our CRM results.

 The entrainment  process is associated with  a  transfer  of mass flux  into the cloud,  

which  we quantify  as a  relative entrainment rate ?,  per  unit  of height.  That  is,  as an 

updraft  with  mass flux  M rises a  small  height  increment  dZ, a  mass flux  ?MdZ of 

environmental air  (assumed to also have the  environmental  value  of  zonal  velocity) is 

mixed  into the  updraft.  The first  term  of the RHS of (5.1) represents this ‘entrainment 

dilution’ of the updraft momentum. 

 The entrainment  rate is empirically  specified  to be  ? = 0.6/Z,  where Z is the 

altitude. This rate was derived from  the profile of  moist  static  energy  in  saturated 

updrafts,  which  below  the  freezing  level is solely  affected  by  entrainment.  Introducing  this 

fractional  entrainment  rate into equation  (5.1)  and considering  a  range of values for  c* 

(which  scales the  pressure gradient  term), the updraft  zonal momentum  equation  is then 

integrated  upward from  cloud base to the tropopause after  discretization  using  the 

forward Euler  scheme,  starting  with  the CRM-simulated zonal wind  at  the cloud base  level 

averaged over the saturated updraft grid points.

Julian Day 358

 To show  the role of entrainment  alone in  modifying  the updraft  zonal wind profile,  

we integrate  the  formula  (5.1) with  c* = 0, shutting  down  the pressure-gradient  force  term. 

Figure 5.2.1  compares this profile and the updraft zonal  wind perturbation  from  the 

environment  with  those simulated  by  the CRM averaged over  Julian  Day  358. The 

entrainment  contribution  by  itself captures well  the  horizontal  velocity  inside the cumulus 

updrafts in  the  lower-levels of  the cloud.  Above  4  km  of height,  the parameterized zonal 

velocity  within  the cumulus updrafts diverges significantly  from  the CRM profile,  with 

differences exceeding  10  m/s in  the  upper  troposphere, although  the vertical  evolution  of 

both  profiles presents the same qualitative  features.  The CRM-derived PGFx is positive  in 

the upper  troposphere  (Fig.  5.1.1)  and would  increase Usup rather  than  decreasing  it  as 

needed, making the discrepancy between (5.1) and the CRM Usup  even worse there.

updraft  zonal  velocity  CRM Usup  (m/s, circled line) simulated by  the CRM and the  parameterized cumulus 

updraft  zonal  velocity  given  by  equation (5.1) assuming the  action of  entrainment  only, discarding the 

contribution from the  pressure-gradient  force  (m/s, dashed line). All  the  profiles are  given  by  the  3D D64T10 

data sets.

 

 The values based on  the linear  regression  analysis for  PGFx do not  improve the 

entrainment-only  fit,  which  is discouraging. If we ignore this analysis and just  assume 

different  c* choices constant  over  height,  we obtain  the colored curves for  Usup in  the left 

panel  of Fig.  5.2.2.  Reasonable agreement,  especially  above  10  km, is obtained using  the 

two highest  c* (0.8  - 0.9).  One could also get  reasonable Usup profiles using  the  linear 

regression  analysis for  PGFx  to specify  c*  in  each  tropospheric  layer  and strongly 

increasing  the lateral entrainment  rate  ?  in  the  middle  and especially  in  the upper 

troposphere  beyond that  diagnosed  from  the CRM.  Either  way,  our  analysis reveals a  lack 

of fundamental understanding  of the factors determining  the updraft  zonal velocity  in 

vigorous, strongly sheared deep convection.

 For  the 10-day  period, the results gotten  by  testing  the GKI97  parameterization  are 

are close to those obtained for  Jd  358.  Figure 5.2.3  shows the  vertical  variation  of cumulus 

updraft  zonal  wind (Usup)  given  by  (5.1) including  only  the  contribution  by  the 

entrainment  process, that  is the cloud pressure-gradient force is turned off.  As on  Jd 358, 

the entrainment  contribution  alone  does not  reproduce the  vertical  variation  of the 

simulated  zonal  wind  inside  the cumulus updrafts throughout  the  troposphere,  except  in  a 

narrow  layer  near  the cloud  base,  although  it produces qualitatively  the right  profile 

shape, suggesting that a greater ? could  bring these two profiles together.

  Figure 5.2.4  shows the  cumulus updraft  zonal  wind  vertical profiles predicted by   

GKI97’s scheme  considering  both  terms of the  RHS  of (5.1). In  the left  plot,  in  which 

several  discrete c* values are  considered, c* = 0.9  retrieves the  closest  parameterized  zonal 

velocity  vertical  distribution  to the corresponding  CRM zonal  wind profile, throughout 

most  of the troposphere.  Using  the  linear  regression  slope for  c* (right  plot) in  (5.2),  the 

predicted  vertical  distribution  of  the zonal wind inside  cumulus updrafts is far  from  the 

CRM Usup profile in  the  middle and  most  part  of upper  troposphere. As a  result,  the zonal 

wind  perturbation  predicted  by  (5.1) is overestimated in  these  tropospheric regions.  In 

summary, these results are similar to those obtained from the analysis of Jd358.

5.3.  Testing the mass-flux approach to convective 

momentum transport parameterization 

 The mass-flux  approximation  for  cumulus updrafts only  was introduced  in  eqn.  

(4.1).  Kershaw  and  Gregory  (1997)  suggested  cumulus updrafts and  downdrafts both 

contribute to CMT, leading  to the  more general mass-flux  approximation  that  we will 

analyze in this section,

                     CMT = Mup Uup ? Uenv( ) + Mdn Udn ? Uenv( )                  (5.3)
where Mup is the updraft  cloud  mass flux,  Mdn is the  downdraft  cloud  mass flux,  ?env is the 

5.3  Testing the mass-flux approach to convective momentum transport parameterization

104



mean  flow,  and ?up and ?dn are the  domain-averaged  zonal  velocities conditionally 

sampled  inside  the cumulus updrafts and downdrafts,  respectively.  The  left-hand side  of 

(5.3)  represents the total  CMT,  the first  term  of the right-hand side  of (5.3) represents the 

CMT  within  the cumulus updrafts and  the  second  term  of the  right-hand side regards the 

CMT  within  cumulus downdrafts.  This formulation  examines the effects of updrafts and 

downdrafts separately,  and consequently  implies that  the fundamental  issue of  predicting 

the total  CMT  (left-hand side of (5.3)) is to parameterize  the cumulus updraft  and 

downdraft mass fluxes and the mean horizontal velocities inside of them. 

 In  this section,  we  evaluate  the mass-flux  approximation  against  CMT  simulated by  

the 3D cloud-resolving  model using  3-dimensional CRM data  to evaluate the variables on 

the right hand  side  of (5.3),  for  instance  the cloud mass fluxes. We will derive  the updraft 

and downdraft  zonal  velocity  perturbation  from  the CRM,  rather  than  trying  to predict 

them  with  a  vertical  velocity  equation  as investigated  in  the previous two sections. Thus, 

we are testing  the fundamental suitability  of a  ‘perfect’ mass-flux  parameterization  for 

representing the CMT simulated by the CRM.

 The data  sets D64T10  and  D64T120-S  provide the  data  to test  this 

parameterization.  The first  data  set  is the 3-hourly  3-dimensional  output  from  which  the 

horizontal  velocities and  horizontal velocity  and vertical velocity  perturbation  are 

extracted.  The  statistics simulation  provides the  hourly  cloud mass flux  profiles averaged 

over  the  spatial  domain  (64  x  64  km2).  The formula  (5.3) is applied to two different  time 

periods: Julian  day  358,  the deep convective event  day,  and the 10-day  period  from  Julian 

days 350 to 359, which includes this episode.

Julian Day 358

 Figure 5.3.1. presents the  vertical variations of  the  cloud  updraft  and downdraft  

mass fluxes and  CMT  contributions derived  from  the CRM and averaged over  Jd  358. 

Total cloud mass flux  and especially  total CMT  are primarily  shaped  by  the contribution 

from  cumulus updrafts. The cumulus updraft  mass flux  is large throughout  the 

troposphere, as discussed in Chapter 3.

Right plot: vertical  profiles of  total  CMT (Pa, solid line), CMT within cumulus updrafts (Pa, dashed line) and

 Figure 5.3.2  compares the  two sides of equation  (5.3) each  computed using  the 

CRM,  for  the  eight  times saved during  Jd  358. Overall, the mass-flux  approximation  works 

fairly  well,  assuming  perfect  knowledge  of the  mass fluxes and the  saturated updraft/

downdraft  zonal velocity  perturbations. The  most  important  centers of negative and 

positive  CMT  are fairly  well captured by  the parameterization.  The magnitudes of the 

mass-flux  estimated  CMT  are slightly  smaller  than  the CRM-estimated  CMT  (top  plots). 

The negative  values below  5  km  and around 10  km  are slightly  underestimated  by  the 

mass-flux  approximation,  especially  toward the end of the day.  The mass-flux 

approximation  also applies quite well  to the  CMT  in  cumulus (saturated)  updrafts (middle 

plots). The  parameterization  does acceptably,  but  less well,  within  the  cumulus 

downdrafts, for which it underestimates the magnitude of CMT variations (bottom plots).

with no data.

 Figure 5.3.3  displays the  vertical  profiles of the total,  updraft  and downdraft  CMT,  

given  by  the CRM and  by  the  mass-flux  approximation  (5.3),  averaging  over  the 8  time 

steps that  compose  Julian  day  358. The time-averaging  smoothes out  the differences 

between  the simulated  and  parameterized CMT. The total  CMT  is still  underestimated  in 

its negative values and overestimated in  its positive  magnitudes,  but  is qualitatively  well 

captured  by  the mass-flux  approximation.  The  greatest  difference  is located between  the 

cloud base and 5  km,  and both  profiles match  well above 10  km.  The CMT  profiles within 

cumulus updrafts and  downdrafts are extremely  well  reproduced by  the mass-flux 

approximation,  except  for  a  slight  overestimation  of the peak  value at  6  km  of height. The 

Chapter 5 - Prediction of the Zonal Wind Perturbation in the Updrafts U’up

107



slight  difference is due  to small ‘eddy’ contributions to the  saturated updraft  and 

downdraft  CMT  due  to positive correlations between  zonal  and vertical velocity 

perturbations within  each  of these categories. We infer  that  the difference seen  in  total 

CMT  is mostly  due to the contribution  of unsaturated air, especially  in  form  of  downdrafts, 

to total CMT,  which  is strongest  below  5  km  (please refer  to Fig.  4.2.1). The mass-flux 

approximation  does not consider  the  role  of unsaturated  air  upon  CMT, but  the  cloud-

resolving model does.

within cumulus updrafts (mid-plot) and within cumulus downdrafts (right plot), for Julian day 358. 

 The temporal correlation  coefficients between  the mass-flux  approximation  to 

CMT  and  the exact simulated  CMT  vary  with  height,  but  are  generally  high.  Close to the 

cloud base level and above 4  km,  the  correlation  between  these fields is above 70%  in  most 

levels, confirming the effectiveness of this approximation.

 The differences between  the mass-flux  approximation  and the  simulated total  CMT  

may  be  investigated by  calculating  the  residual  of equation  (5.3),  shown  in  Figure 5.3.4  for 

the CRM.  This residual is the sum  of the  unsaturated  air  contribution  and smaller  ‘eddy’ 

contributions to the  CMT  due  to positive correlations between  zonal  and vertical velocity 

perturbations within  each  of  these categories.  As one might  also infer  from  the left  panel 

of Fig.  5.3.3, the simulated residual CMT  is not  negligible,  especially  in  the  lower  and  mid-

troposphere.  However, compared to the profound problems we have found  in  predicting 

UPsup,  the overall inaccuracy  in  the mass-flux  approximation  seems like a  less important 

source of error in predicting CMT.

difference between total CMT and CMT contributed by cumulus drafts, for Julian day 358.

Julian Days 350:359

 For  the 10-day  period,  the  results obtained  from  the same  approach  are,  as 

expected,  considerably  similar.  The vertical structure of the cloud mass fluxes and  CMT 

inside cumulus updrafts and  downdrafts are displayed in  figure 5.3.5.  The  ten-day  average 

cloud mass flux  profiles have  similar  shape  but  slightly  smaller  magnitude  than  those 

simulated  for  Jd  358,  which  was a  period  of particularly  intense convection,  but  are 

otherwise similar  to that  day.  However, the CMT  vertical structures are  somewhat 

different  from  those in  Jd  358.  The total  ten-day  mean  CMT  is about  half than  that  for  Jd 

358, and is negative  throughout  most  of  the troposphere. The 10-day  mean  vertical 

structure of total  CMT  somewhat  follows the  cumulus updrafts CMT  vertical  profile but  

the fraction  of the  CMT  explained  by  the  saturated  updrafts and downdrafts is smaller 

Chapter 5 - Prediction of the Zonal Wind Perturbation in the Updrafts U’up

109



than  for  Jd358, especially  in  the lower  troposphere. That is,  unsaturated vertical  motions 

are doing  most  of the CMT at  the lower  levels,  and the  CMT  due to these motions is 

consistently  negative throughout  the  troposphere,  but  particularly  from  cloud  base up  to 8 

km.  Figures 5.3.7  and 5.3.6  compare  the mass-flux  approximation  (5.3)  and  the 

corresponding  fields simulated by  the CRM for  saturated updrafts, saturated  downdrafts 

and the entire CMT. 

Figure 5.3.5.  Left plot: vertical  profiles of  total  cloud mass flux  (solid line), updraft cloud mass flux  (dashed 

line) and downdraft  cloud mass flux  (dotted line) given  by  the D64T120-S data  set; Right plot: vertical  profiles 

of  total  CMT (solid line), CMT within  cumulus updrafts (dashed line) and CMT within cumulus downdrafts 

(dotted line) given by the 3D data set; all profiles are averaged over the 10-day period.

 The mass-flux  approximation  accurately  captures most  of the day-to-day  

variability  in  the cumulus updrafts (middle panels) and  downdrafts (lower  panels), but 

does not  include the large  contribution  from  unsaturated  CMT.  The vertical profiles of the 

the 10-day  mean  CMT  and  the  mass-flux  approximation  are  exhibited in  Figure  5.3.8. 

These panels also show  that  the mass-flux  approximation  is noisy  but  generally  tracks the 

CMT  for  both  saturated updrafts and  downdrafts,  with  larger  errors in  the total  CMT.  As 

in  Jd358  analysis,  the implication  is that  biggest  error  in  the mass flux  representation  of 

CMT  is its neglect of unsaturated CMT. This error  can  be  clearly  seen  in  Figure 5.3.9,

As for  Jd358,  this contribution  is of the  same magnitude as the total  CRM CMT  in  the 

lower  troposphere,  where  it  is a  dominant source of negative  cumulus momentum  fluxes 

throughout  the period, and  especially  on  the days leading  up the  deep convective event 

(Jd356-358).

Discussion and Directions for Future  

Work

 Cumulus convection  embedded in  a  tropical  atmosphere  is a  complex  subject  and a  

broad field of research,  yet  it is of vital  importance  to understand in  order  to build  up 

skillful parameterizations to be used  in  global  climate models and numerical  weather 

prediction  models,  improving  their  simulations of the  general circulation  of the 

atmosphere.  Most  of  this complexity  originates from  the  intricate internal  structure  of 

cumulus clouds, composed by  a  number  of short-lived  individual rising  buoyant  towers 

which  are  nonhydrostatic, unsteady  and  highly  turbulent, and internally  driven  by  latent 

heating, giving  them  a  unique character  and making  it  difficult  to completely  access them 

through  observations and model  studies.  Cumulus clouds are strongly  affected by  the 

thermodynamic and  moisture structures of their  environment, as well  as the  horizontal 

and vertical velocity fields on much larger scales.

 On  the other  hand,  to understand  tropical  motion  systems,  one  must  comprehend 

and evaluate the  strong  interactions among  cumulus convection, mesoscale and  large-

scale circulations.  Quantifying  the effect of  deep  precipitating  cumulus clouds on  the 

dynamics and energetics of  large-scale  atmospheric systems is of primary  importance, due 

to the great  magnitudes of the  energy  transformations associated with  the changes of 

water  phases in  deep  precipitating  cumulus clouds and their  updrafts and  downdrafts 

which  often  occupy  most  of  the troposphere,  as well  as the  vertical convective  transports 

of heat, moisture and momentum.

 Convective  momentum  transport  has proved  to be a  difficult  field of  research,  

mostly  due to the nature of its interactions with  the large-scale environment: observations 

of the horizontal wind perturbations and  cloud-mass fluxes,  for  instance,  are very  hard  to 

Chapter 6 - Discussion and Directions for Future Work

obtain,  and inferring  the CMT  over  large  regions from  budget  studies continues to have 

large  uncertainties. In  addition,  the effect  of CMT  on  tropical  circulations, while 

important, is much  more  subtle than  that  of latent  heating  in  cumulus clouds. For  this 

reason,  progressing  in  parameterizing  convective momentum  transport  has been  slow  in 

comparison  with  the  convective transports of  heat  and  moisture, which  have attracted 

more attention by the scientific community. 

 One  good way  to seek  understanding  of the mechanisms underlying  convective 

momentum  transport  is to use cloud-resolving  models which,  for  the  last  decade, are  the 

most  advanced  tool for  simulating  cumulus cloud  systems. Cloud-resolving  models are 

able  to explicitly  resolve convective  motions and  simulate  the  properties of the cloud and 

their  environment,  however  they  still need  parameterizations microphysical processes, 

like cloud microphysics and precipitation  loading, and  unresolved subgrid turbulence. 

 This thesis has analyzed  CMT  in  3-dimensional  cloud-resolving  model simulations 

of a  very  important  four  month  observational  campaign  over  the warm  pool  of western 

Pacific – TOGA  COARE,  characterized by  episodes of strong  convection  in  varying 

horizontal  wind profiles that  can  produce diverse patterns of CMT. The  fundamental goal 

of this thesis was to investigate  the  convective momentum  fluxes by  tropical deep 

convective  clouds over  the  ocean  and  compare them  with  assumptions used  in 

parameterizations of CMT,  aiming  to contribute for  improvements of future  cumulus 

parameterizations.  Our  analysis was inspired by  previously  proposed  theoretical 

formulations and other  modeling  case-studies.  Our  cloud  resolving  model  simulations 

improve on  previous modeling  studies by  using  a  combination  of a  larger  and/or  a  longer 

period of simulation.

 Some  conclusions from  our  analysis are as follows.  First,  no prior  study  has 

investigated  the sensitivity  of CMT  to the  model  horizontal  domain  size. This is a 

important model feature,  because  even  if the cloud-resolving  model  can't  resolve larger-

scale motions,  the  increase of the spatial  domain  size corresponds to an  expansion  of  the 

influence  of the initial  large-scale forcing,  as well  as initial  and boundary  conditions, and 

allows development  of mesoscale convective organization  that  has been  hypothesized to be 

important for  CMT.  By  comparing  simulations with  domains 64  km  and 256  km  on  a  side, 

we found  that convective  momentum  transport  is not sensitive to this change  of the  model 

horizontal domain size.

 A  second  important  new  conclusion  was the important  role  of unsaturated  motions 

in  CMT  in  the  lower  troposphere.  Unsaturated downdrafts around cumulus clouds are  not 

considered  in  any  current  CMT  parameterizations,  but  make  up a  substantial  fraction  of 

the overall  CMT  at  altitudes below  5  km,  according  to our  simulations. Except  for  this 

contribution,  a  mass-flux  approximation  in  which  CMT  is attributed to updraft  and 

Chapter 6 - Discussion and Directions for Future Work

116



downdrafts contributions each  given  as the product  of a  mass flux  and a  horizontal 

velocity perturbation, works satisfactorily.

 A  third conclusion  was that  a  downgradient  mixing-length  parameterization  to 

CMT  works well  in  the upper  troposphere,  where  there are extensive  regions of turbulent 

cumulus anvil detrained  from  the  strongest  updrafts,  and that  the appropriate mixing 

length  is around 1  km. This mixing  length  is much  smaller  than  what  we would expect 

from  typical  entrainment  rates used for  thermodynamic variables in  cumulus 

parameterizations, suggesting  that  those entrainment  rates are  far  too small  to describe 

momentum  mixing.  On  the other  hand,  in  the  mid-troposphere, downgradient 

momentum mixing has little skill in predicting CMT.

 Lastly,  we compared  our  CRM results to the modern  GKI97  mass-flux  

parameterization  of CMT  including  entrainment  and pressure-gradient  effects on  updrafts 

and downdrafts.  We found that  the pressure-gradient  contribution  to horizontally 

accelerating  updraft  air  is only  a  third as large  in  the CRM than  assumed  in  the CMT 

parameterization.  We also found that  the  entrainment  of momentum  was too weak to keep 

the updraft  horizontal  velocity  as close to the environmental  zonal  velocity  as found  in  the 

CRM.  Together, these suggest  that  one should use a  smaller  PGFx contribution  but  a  much 

larger  upper-tropospheric  entrainment  rate in  this parameterization  than  is currently 

done.

  This investigation  has enriched our  knowledge about  the vertical  transport  of 

horizontal  momentum  in  cumulus convection  through  a  more concrete understanding 

about  its properties uncovered  by  3-dimensional CRM simulations.  It has also suggested 

some directions for  future work.  The role  of unsaturated  drafts upon  CMT,  a  more  reliable 

deep convective entrainment  rate  for  momentum  and the  role of updraft  pressure-

gradient  forces should all be  studied  for  a  wider  variety  of types of  cumulus convection, to 

test  the  robustness of our  results.  It  may  be  necessary  to separately  parameterize the 

unsaturated downdrafts around  cumulus clouds.  As a  start,  it  would be good to extend our 

analysis to the  whole four-month  campaign  period  of TOGA  COARE,  which  was not 

completely performed due to time constraints.
