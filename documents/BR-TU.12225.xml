Abstract 

The first glass-ionomer cement (GIC) was developed by Wilson and Kent in 

1971. GICs are usually prepared through the mixing of a fluoroaluminosilicate glass 

powder, polyacrylic acid (PAA) and water. The PAA attacks the glass particles that 

leach some of its cations (e.g. Al3+ and Ca2+) to the cement matrix. These cations 

cross-link the PAA chains yielding the final cement structure. GICs possess as main 

advantage the ability to bind to hydroxyapatite present in the dentin and bone. These 

systems have been mainly used in the dentistry field (non-systemic application). 

Applications that induce a systemic uptake of the cement components (e.g. bone 

cements) have been discarded due to the presence of aluminium (a known neurotoxin) 

on the GIC formulations. 

The present thesis targets the development of new glass-ionomer cement (GIC) 

formulations with potential to be applied as bone cements. To this purpose, new 

aluminium-free glass compositions of general formula 0.340SiO2 : 0.300ZnO : (0.250-x-

y)CaO : xSrO : yMgO: 0.050Na2O : 0.060P2O5 (where x and y = 0.000 or 0.125) were 

synthesised and tested in the formulation of GICs through their mixing with PAA and 

water. The different parameters that influence the GIC mechanical performance (e.g. 

glass particle size, molecular weight of PAA, proportion of the constituents, etc.) were 

optimized. The GIC prepared with the developed glass compositions where in vitro 

tested for their bioactivity. To this purpose, GIC samples were immersion in SBF and 

their ability to form a surface apatite layer was evaluated by: 1) determination of the 

concentration of the calcium and phosphorous in the SBF (executed by ICP); 2) 

quantification of the calcium and phosphorous present at the surface of the cements 

(executed by EDS) and 3) morphological analysis (executed by SEM). Micro-CT was 

also used to evaluate the spatial distribution of the polymeric and inorganic phases. 

Finally, in an attempt to enhance the GIC biodegradability it was incorporated starch in 

the cement formulations, at different weight percentages (5% and 25%). 

The results obtained under this thesis proved the suitability of some of the developed 

glass compositions (e.g. 0.34SiO2: 0.30ZnO: 0.125CaO: 0.125SrO: 0.05Na2O: 

0.06P2O5) to prepare GICs in accordance with its use as bone cements, including: 

suitable mechanical performance (compressive strength, CS=25 MPa; compressive 

modulus, CM=492 MPa) for non-load bearing applications; bioactivity; and 35 % 

porosity. Moreover, after the 8th week of degradation under enzymatic medium it was 

detected reducing sugars in the degradation solutions of the starch-containing 

formulations confirming its biodegradation potential at a longer timeframe.

Resumo 

O primeiro cimento de ionómero de vidro (GIC) foi desenvolvido por Wilson e 

Kent em 1971. Estes cimentos são normalmente preparados através de uma mistura 

de um pó de vidro geralmente fluoroaluminosilicatos com ácido poliacrilico (PAA) e 

água. O PAA ataca as partículas de vidro que liberta alguns dos seus catiões (e.g. Al3+ 

e Ca2+) para a matriz do cimento que vão ligar-se às cadeias do PAA. Os cimentos 

possuem como vantagens a capacidade para se ligarem à hidroxiapatite presente nos 

dentes e ossos. Estes sistemas têm sido usados principalmente na área dentária 

(aplicações não sistémicas). Aplicações que induzem uma absorção sistémica dos 

componentes do cimento têm sido rejeitadas devido à presença de alumínio (uma 

neurotoxina conhecida). 

 A presente tese tem como principal objetivo o desenvolvimento de novas 

formulações de cimentos de ionómero de vidro para aplicação como cimentos ósseos. 

Para este propósito, foram sintetizadas novas composições de vidros sem alumínio 

com a fórmula geral 0.340SiO2: 0.300ZnO: (0.250-x-y)CaO: xSrO: yMgO: 0.050Na2O: 

0.060P2O5 (onde x e y = 0.000 ou 0.125) e utilizadas na formulação de cimentos 

através da mistura com PAA e água. Os parâmetros que influenciam a performance 

mecânica dos cimentos (e.g. tamanho de partícula, peso molecular do PAA, proporção 

dos constituintes, etc.) foram otimizados. Os cimentos foram analisados in vitro para 

obter informação acerca da sua bioactividade. Para este estudo, amostras de cimentos 

foram imersas em SBF e a sua capacidade de formar uma superfície de apatite foi 

avaliada através da: 1) determinação da concentração de cálcio e fósforo presente em 

SBF (efetuado por ICP); 2) quantificação de cálcio e fósforo presente na superfície dos 

cimentos (efetuado por EDS); 3) análise morfológica (efetuado por SEM). Micro-CT foi 

utilizado para avaliar a distribuição de fases poliméricas e inorgânicas. Finalmente, 

para obtenção de cimentos biodegradáveis foi incorporado amido na sua formulação, 

com diferentes percentagens (5% e 25%). 

Os resultados obtidos nesta tese demonstraram a possibilidade de algumas 

composições de vidro (e.g. 0.340SiO2: 0.300ZnO: 0.125CaO: 0.125SrO: 0.050Na2O: 

0.060P2O5) contribuírem para a preparação de cimentos com interesse para aplicação 

como cimentos ósseos, incluindo uma adequada performance mecânica (Compressive 

strength, CS= 25 MPa; Compressive modulus, CM= 492 MPa) para zonas de carga 

não permanente, bioactividade e 35 % de porosidade. Além disso, após a oitava 

semana de degradação em condições enzimáticas foram detetados açúcares 

redutores nas formulações contendo amido confirmando o seu potencial de 

biodegradação.

1. General remarks 
This thesis addresses developments and optimizations on glass-ionomer 

cements (GICs) targeting their application in the repair of bone. Under this 

perspective, this introductory chapter will comprise an initial section that 

includes a series of considerations on the bone tissue, namely, its structure, 

properties, repair steps and self-regeneration. Afterwards, it will be presented a 

section on the biomaterials relevant to the bone regeneration and repair, 

namely, the inorganic-based bone cements - the group of materials that present 

properties and characteristics more similar to the system under study. This 

section also includes relevant concepts in the biomedical field, such as, 

biodegradability and bioactivity. Finally, a third section will focus on the GIC 

system, its components, curing reactions, properties, applications, advantages 

and disadvantages. 

2. Bone regeneration/treatment 

2.1 Bone – What is it? 
Bone is one of the main constituents of the skeleton that acts as a 

support structure for the vertebrates. In the materials point of view, it has been 

considered as a heterogeneous bioceramic composite exhibiting variations on 

its chemical composition in between species. In fact the most noted differences 

in its mineral constitution are observed between two types of bones: rat and fish 

bone. It was also detected differentiated chemical composition in the skeletons 

of the hamster, monkey, pig, man and other vertebrates [1-5]. 

In order to better understand the relationships between bone chemical 

composition and its properties it is relevant to understand the mechanisms 

involved in bone related chemical processes, e.g. chemistry of calcification, 

bone as an ion reservoir, among others. Biltz and co-workers also concluded 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction 

 

4 

 

that bone possesses chemical differences that are dependent on the age, 

exerted strength, metabolic activity and sex of the individual. Depending on 

these factors, it is observed a variation on the quantity of water and organic 

components present in the bone. In this perspective, it was also established a 

relationship between the bone water content and its degree of mineralization 

[3]. 

Each individual presents different types of bone within the body. The main 

differences are related with its density, from a more compact structure (cortical 

bone) to a less dense material (cancellous bone). Based in the study of the 

bone individual components it was concluded that its main properties (stiffness, 

elasticity, hardness and toughness) are derived from their combination in an 

heterogeneous structure [1]. It is also known that systematic loading affects 

bone mass and size. This is one of the reasons for the observed variations on 

bone density with the age of the individual [5]. 

2.2 Constitution of bone 

Bone is a metabolically active tissue composed by a mineral and an organic 

phase that contribute to two thirds and one third of its weight, respectively [4]. 

As shown in Figure 1 the bone exhibits a structure that has elements of several 

length scales and which, together, perform various mechanical, chemical and 

biological functions, e.g. it acts as a support structure, reservoir of mineral ions, 

among others [6] 

 

Figure 1: Hierarchical structural organization of bone. 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction 

 

5 

 

Has stated before, bone is a heterogeneous bioceramic that combines an 

inorganic with an organic phase. In terms of its chemical composition, its main 

component is in the inorganic phase: carbonated hydroxyapatite (60-70 % w/w) 

of low crystallinity. The organic phase is mainly composed by fibrils of Type I 

collagen, although, other components are present, namely: growth factors and 

glycosaminoglycans. Finally, approximately 10 % of bone is composed by water 

[2]. 

The different types of bones (e.g. cortical or cancellous) are histologically 

different, although, their chemical composition is similar. Cortical bone 

represents, approximately, 80 % of the skeleton. It is dense and compact and 

possesses a high resistance to bending. Most of this type of bone is calcified 

and its main function is mechanical support and protection. Cancellous bone 

represents 20 % of skeletal mass and, approximately, 80% is found at the ends 

of long bones and in the interior of the vertebrae and pelvis. It is less dense, 

more elastic, and has a higher turnover rate than compact bone [7]. 

Bone is also constituted by cells. In fact there are three main types of cells in 

the bone tissue: osteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts are the 

cells responsible for synthesis and deposition of minerals and, therefore, the 

mineralization of bone extracellular matrix. During their activity osteoblasts can 

become isolated in a cavity surrounded by bone matrix as a result of the 

deposition of minerals. Under these circumstances they differentiate into 

osteocytes, one of the most abundant types of cell in bone. Finally, osteoclasts 

are responsible for the bone remodelling process and their principal function is 

to resorb mineralized bone [8]. 

2.3 Mechanical properties of bone 

In the context of mechanical evaluation it is relevant to describe the 

different data that can be extracted from the uniaxial mechanical tests. In this 

perspective, Figure 2 presents a stress-strain curve obtained from a mechanical 

test. The curve is the result of applied stress and the following data can be 

collected [1]: 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction 

 

6 

 

• Beginning of the elastic behaviour; 

• Elastic range; 

• Range of plastic deformation; 

• Breaking point; 

• Amount of energy absorbed by the material; 

• Elastic modulus (measuring the slope at the elastic range).  

 

 

Figure 2: Stages of mechanical deformation: the elastic range (E), the continuum 

damage mechanics range (CDM) and the fracture mechanics (FM). 

The mechanical behaviour of a material can be divided in three phases (I, II and 

III). Under I (the elastic regime) the material deforms reversibly and only 

residual damage occurs. Phase II corresponds to the plastic regime where the 

material absorbs enough energy to develop microcracks. In phase III it occur 

mechanical failure and the amount of energy that the material is able to absorb 

reduces drastically. 

Under mechanical loading, the bone can suffer of different types of ageing that 

can lead to fractures. These ageing mechanisms can be derived from creep 

(with prolonged load) or fatigue (repetitive) [9]. It has become recently clear that 

bone and other biological hard tissues show weak interlamellar interfaces, 

which are able to absorb energy and/or divert a crack. In this way, bone has a 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction 

 

7 

 

limited capacity to detain the onset and growth of fracture. Furthermore, it is 

now increasingly clear that initiation of cracks in biomineralized tissues is far 

less important than their propagation since biological tissues use a number of 

processes (e.g. crack diversion/deflection, fibre pull-out, crack and/or matrix 

bridging) to increase the required amount of energy for fracture to occur [9]. 

The mechanical behaviour of bone depends on its type (cortical or cancellous). 

Additionally, as with any biological sample its variability is significant 

representing a reasonably large interval of expectable values. Table 1 resumes 

the most relevant mechanical properties of the two main types of bone. 

 

Table 1: Mechanical properties of cortical and cancellous bone [10]. 

Property Cortical bone Cancellous bone 

Compressive strength (MPa) 100-230 2-12 

Flexural, tensile strength (MPa) 50-150 10-20 

Strain to failure (%) 1-3 5-7 

Young’s (tensile) modulus (GPa) 7-30 0.5-0.05 

 

2.4 Bone repair 

When the ends of fractured bone are held in place, there are two types of 

primary mineralized tissue healing that can occur: gap repair and contact repair. 

In gap repair, healing begins by the formation of blood vessels and connective 

tissue fills the empty spaces. After 2 weeks osteoblasts fill the gaps in the tissue 

by secreting osteoid. Upon 10 more days osteoids became mineralized and the 

osteoblasts that remained in the matrix become entrapped. The new bone acts 

as a scaffold for remodelling promoted by osteoclasts and osteoblasts. In 

contact repair, there is no gap between the bone ends, although, necrotic bone 

must be removed before new bone can be deposited to repair the fracture. 

Osteoclasts are responsible to resorb the necrotic bone. Afterwards, 

osteoblasts attach to the tissue matrix, creating a ruffled cell border between the 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction

cell and the bone surface promoting mineralization of the bone and subsequent 

re-linking of the bone surfaces. 

In bone repair, secondary healing occurs when bones are not rigidly supported 

after the injury. The first step is to create an ECM-rich bridge to support the 

fracture and the unstabilized mineralized tissue will undergo secondary repair. 

Most compact bone surfaces that make up the outer layer are covered by 

osteoblasts that promote mineralization. The wound site will re-gain some 

mechanical strength after 4 days of healing (Figure 3 (a)). 

 

  

(a) (b) 

Figure 3: (a) Primary and secondary mineralized tissue repair; (b) Primary and 

secondary bone remodelling. 

The mineralized bone remodelling is a dynamic process and occurs throughout 

the life of the individual. It produces new bone to be able to handle the demands 

of mechanical stresses. Primary gap remodelling also occurs during the repair 

process and lamellar bone (that presents collagen in a lamellar structure) is 

used as scaffold. After ca. 4 weeks osteogenesis stops leaving behind a 

vascularized cavity called an osteon that runs parallel to the long axis. A greater 

ultimate strength is obtained when a more osteons cross the injury site. 

In primary gap healing, remodeling is important for restoring tissue strength. 

However, in primary contact healing, remodeling is coupled to the repair 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction

process. During contact remodeling, the cutting cones mature, depositing 

lamellar bone centripetally to form ring-shaped structures. 

The remodelling can last until 6 months and the healed bone is similar to the 

non-injured tissue in terms of robustness, although, it appears less organized. 

In this step it is also required to remove the excess of callus produced during 

the bone repair, being this step one of the main differences between the two 

reparation processes: primary and secondary. This callus removal is executed 

by the osteoclasts (Figure 3 (b)) [11]. 

 

2.5 Self-regeneration of bone 

Bone is a dynamic tissue that is being formed and resorbed in a 

continuous cycle. These activities are executed in response to hormonal and 

physical factors. Bone is able to regenerate under different circumstances, e.g. 

when a fracture occurs in the bone. Unfortunately, this ability for self-

regeneration is limited when the size of the trauma is too large. These cases 

are known as critical size defects due to the inability of the bone to self-

regenerate. In order to repair these defects it is mandatory to execute a bone 

replacement. This can be achieved using a series of different biomaterials [12]. 

3. Biomaterials relevant to bone regeneration/repair 
A biomaterial is a synthetic or natural material used to: replace part of 

living tissue; or to restore a specific function of the living tissue. From this 

definition it is clear to understand that the development of biomaterials usually 

comprise different fields of knowledge (Table 2), from materials science, biology 

and medicine. The effective influence of these areas is dependent on the 

specific tissue that is targeted and the function that the biomaterial is required to 

execute. In Table 3 is shown the application areas of the biomaterials. These 

can range from assistance in the diagnostic and treatment of diseases to tissue 

replacement or correction and improvement of tissue function [13].

The specific biological responses that the different biomaterials promote when 

in contact with the cells and body fluids are an important factor to be considered 

when designing new biomaterials [14-16]. In fact, the biomaterial-cell interaction 

is governed by the biomaterial surface and composition. Moreover, the different 

biomaterial properties (e.g. mechanical, biocompatibility, etc.) are governing 

their application area.

As can be seen from Table 4, in general, biomaterials can be produced from a 

variety of different materials (e.g. polymers, metals, ceramics and composites), 

although, their selection is dependent on their specific properties. As an 

example, while ceramics, metals and composites are usually used to repair 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction 

 

12 

 

tissues that require high mechanical modulus, polymers that present lower 

mechanical modulus are usually selected to develop biomaterials for the repair 

or substitution of soft tissue. In the following subsection it will be presented 

examples of ceramic-based biomaterials due to the fact that is the type of 

biomaterials that presents more similarities with the systems studied under this 

thesis (GICs). 

3.1 Ceramic-based biomaterials 

Calcium phosphate cements (CPCs) were introduced in the field of 

bioceramics more than two decades ago and represented a real change in the 

medical applications. The possibility to have an injectable material with 

mouldable behaviour represented benefits for several clinical applications, e.g. 

minicracks, maxillofacial deformities and defects, vertebroplasty, among many 

others. 

The formation of CPCs is based on the combination of one or more calcium 

orthophosphates. These phosphates are mixed with the liquid phase forming a 

paste that is able to set and harden after being implanted within the body. The 

CPC setting occurs through dissolution and precipitation of its components 

throughout the curing reactions. Its hardening is based on the entanglement of 

the precipitated crystalline phases. The most stable crystalline phases formed 

during the CPC curing are hydroxyapatite and brushite at pH &gt;4.2 and pH&lt;4.2, 

respectively [17]. 

The understanding of the mechanism of interaction of CPCs, allows accessing 

their long-term potential. It has been shown the occurrence of a gradual 

modification at the ceramic surface due to dissolution, precipitation and ion-

exchange reactions. These events results in the production of a carbonate-

containing, calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite with small crystal sizes. These 

changes are the beginning of a series of events that promotes bioactivity and 

that induces parallel reactions in cellular activity, bone mineralization and 

organic matrix deposition. 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction 

 

13 

 

Absorption of proteins and other biological molecules occurs and the 

surrounding cells attach to the CPC surface. All these phenomena lead to the 

gradual incorporation of the ceramic into the regenerated bone tissue. Calcium 

phosphate ceramics include several materials which differ not only in their 

chemical composition, but also in their specific surface area, macro- and 

microporosity and crystal structure. There are differences due to variations in 

the calcium to phosphate ratio; as examples, tricalcium phosphate, 

hydroxyapatite and tetracalcium phosphate have Ca/P ratios of 1.50, 1.67 and 

2.00 respectively, and there are other materials with ratios in between these 

(Table 5). Furthermore, hydroxyl ions may be missing from the structure, as in 

oxyhydroxyapatite, and other trace ions may be present. The importance of 

these compositional variations is not merely academic but they affect the 

biological response [18].

Different types of bone cements are available for filling bone defects originated 

by illness or traumatic accident. More recently, bone cements have been tested 

for tendon-bone healing. In this perspective, Osteocrete, a magnesium-based 

injectable bone cement, has been reported to possess tensile strength 3 times 

higher than the calcium-based CPCs in both tendon-bone attachments and 

bone-bone structures. It has also been shown to enhance the formation of bone 

callous in an osteotomy model when compared with CPCs. While these 

preliminary studies are encouraging, the ability of Osteocrete to improve the 

healing of the bone tissue has not been studied [19]. 

Synthetic hydroxyapatite is a calcium-phosphate bioceramic of general 

chemical formula Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2. It has been tested in the development of 

different types of biomaterials mainly targeting the substitution/regeneration of 

bone. This approach follows a biomimetic path derived from the fact that 

hydroxyapatite is one of the main constituents of natural bone. In fact, the 

inclusion of hydroxyapatite in biomaterials usually enhances their bioactivity and 

biocompatibility [20-23].The advances in the ceramic technology generated a 

significant number of ceramic materials for medical purposes. As an example, 

tricalcium phosphate (TCP) was first proposed in 1920 as a bioresorbable 

substance to fill bone defects. However, TCP is a weak ceramic, unable to 

sustain significant loading. The need for tougher and stronger ceramics was not 

met before 1965, when the fillers alumina-based materials were proposed for 

the substitution of hip joints. Zirconia and synthetic calcium phosphate ceramics 

(together with other calcium and/or phosphorus containing ceramics and 

glasses) were then proposed as alternatives to alumina and TCP, respectively. 

After roughly 100 years of clinical use, we come to the conclusion that there is, 

so far, no ceramic biomaterial able to create a strong and biologically relevant 

interface with bone. On the other hand, ceramics and glasses are able to 

promote direct bone-implant adhesion without soft tissue interlayer, although, 

their mechanical properties are not sufficient to allow their use in load-bearing 

applications [24]. 

 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction

3.2 Biocompatibility and bioactivity 

Biocompatibility is defined as the ability of a material has to give an 

appropriate response to a specific application (this definition was established by 

consensus among the specialists in the field of biomaterials, in a conference in 

Chester, UK. Williams 1987). Inevitably the introduction of a new material in the 

human body produces a specific response that depends on the composition of 

the biomaterial, shape, size, geometry and aspects of the organism/patient such 

as age, immunological sensitivity, health, local implant, among others. 

Therefore, it is difficult to mention what are the parameters that should be 

accounted to evaluate the biocompatibility of a specific material. Under this 

perspective each biomaterial should be evaluated according to the roles that it 

was designed to execute [25]. 

The bioactivity of a material is related with his ability to produce a chemical or 

biological response from the surrounding medium in order to promote tissue 

regeneration. A typical in vitro bioactivity test evaluates the ability of the 

biomaterial to form an apatite surface layer when in contact with simulated body 

fluid (SBF), a solution that presents the ionic concentrations similar to human 

blood plasma. The higher the ability of the biomaterial to form an apatite layer 

the higher is its bioactive potential [26]. As an example bioglass was the first 

successful glass to present bioactivity. It was first reported by Hench and co-

workers in 1970s and was used clinically. The main application of these glasses 

is for replacement of the damaged tissue, as for example, treatment of facial 

bone injuries or benign bone tumours [27, 28]. 

3.3 The relevance of biodegradability 

Biodegradable biomaterials are used in reconstructive surgery when the 

body itself has the capacity to self-regenerate the damaged tissue. Usually, a 

biomaterial to be used under this approach needs to present bioactivity and to 

promote tissue growth/regeneration. Upon application, the biomaterial start the 

degrade allowing the surrounding tissue to grow to the intervened area. The 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction 

 

17 

 

correct matching between its degradation rate and the tissue 

growth/regeneration allows a complete regeneration of the damaged tissue 

upon full degradation of the biomaterial. Under this perspective it is of critical 

importance the non-toxicity of the degradation products. The first synthesized 

biodegradable biomaterial approved to be used in clinical applications (e.g. 

sutures) was the poly(glycolic acid) (PGA). With the progress of tissue 

engineering other biodegradable materials were developed (e.g. gellan gum, 

etc.) [29, 30]. The biodegradable biomaterials can be applied in the biomedical 

field in a diversified manner. In Table 6 it is presented examples of the targeted 

applications of biomedical devices produced using biodegradable biomaterials 

[8].

A common approach to impart biodegradability to different biomaterials is the 

addition of starch. This methodology has been attempted in the development of 

bone cements [31, 32]. Starch is a glucose-based polymer created by the 

combination of two structures: amylose and amylopectin (Figure 4). 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction 

 

18 

 

 

Figure 4: Structure of starch (amylose and amylopectin) [33].  

 

Amylose is an essentially linear structure where the glucose units are joined by 

?(1?4) glycosidic linkages. Amylopectin consists of linear ?(1?4) linked 

glucose chains including branched positions with ?(1?6) linkages every 24 to 

30 glucose residues, on average [8]. 

One of the main advantages of including biodegradable starch in the 

formulation of biomaterials is the presence of ?-amylase in the Human body that 

is specific for starch components. Additionally, its degradation products are not 

toxic and metabolized by the body. 

4. Glass-ionomer cements (GICs) 
4.1 The development of GICs 

Wilson and Kent created the first conventional GICs combining a glass 

powder from the system SiO2-Al2O3-CaO-CaF2 with PAA, as a result of their 

pioneering work at the Laboratory of the Government Chemist, London, in the 

early 1970s [34-49]. The studied glasses became vulnerable to acid attack and 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction 

 

19 

 

established a strong link with the acidic PAA [40]. Initial application of these 

GICs was in dentistry, as a colour matched alternatives to amalgam restoratives 

due to two main advantages: strong adhesion to dentin and ability to prevent 

caries in tooth structures [34, 50-52]. Research work during the following 

decades addressed their main disadvantages, namely, sensitivity to moisture 

during initial hardening; poor mechanical properties, among others [53]. 

Different optimizations introduced in the following decades resulted in the 

development of conventional GIC formulations that present enhanced 

mechanical performance, tuned curing time and reduced sensitivity to moisture. 

More significant modifications were promoted with the addition of UV-curable 

resins in the cement matrix. These resin-modified GICs present mechanical 

properties that overpass most of the conventional GICs, although, their anti-

cariogenic potential was significantly reduced. In this sense, their properties, 

ease of moulding and ease of application, still makes conventional GIC as an 

extremely versatile solution for cementing a series of different biomaterials. 

4.2 The importance of glass composition 

The glass powder present in GIC formulations is usually composed by 

calcium fluoroaluminosilicates. This component has two main functions: 1) to 

act as a source of cations essential for the evolution of the cement curing 

reactions; and 2) to reinforce the final cement structure. 

Within the typical glass systems used in GIC formulations it is possible to 

distinguish glass formers (e.g. SiO2), glass modifiers (Ca
2+) and components 

with intermediate behaviour (e.g. Al2O3). The selection of components to be 

used in the glass formulation is dependent on several factors, including their 

influence in: the glass mechanical properties; the glass reactivity; and, most 

important, the glass basicity. In fact, the GIC curing is governed by acid-base 

reactions between an acidic polymer and a basic glass. In this sense, it is 

mandatory that the glass structure presents significant basicity. This basicity is 

usually conferred by the modifier cations. 

 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction 

 

20 

 

4.3 Methodologies to synthesize the glass component 

4.3.1 Melt-quenching methodology 

Melt-quenching methodology is a high temperature process that involves 

the melting of the whole glass formulation and its subsequent fast decrease of 

temperature below the glass transition (Tg). This procedure induces the 

formation of the short to medium range order that is characteristic of glasses. 

The timeframe of the temperature reduction is so short that it does not allow the 

formation of long-range structural ordering. In general, glasses produced by this 

methodology present higher stability when compared with other glass 

preparation methods, e.g. sol-gel. Additionally, melt-quenched glasses usually 

promote the improvement of the mechanical behaviour of GIC compositions 

[14]. 

One of the main drawbacks of the melt-quenching technique is the fact that not 

all the compositions produce a melt. Depending on the glass compositions the 

melting temperature of the formulation is, in some cases, difficult to achieve with 

laboratory furnaces. Additionally, in the quenching step it is important to reach 

the appropriate temperature decrease rate that is also dependent on the 

composition. This should be fast enough to limit nucleation and to inhibit 

crystallization of the structure, although, nucleation and crystallization rates are 

also dependent on the composition. In fact, some formulations present a very 

high nucleation and crystallization rate and the production of pure glass phases 

is difficult. In these cases the melt quenching methodology generates crystalline 

phases within the glass phase, i.e. glass-ceramics. 

4.3.2 Sol-gel methodology 

The sol-gel methodology is based on the hydrolysis and condensation of 

the glass former precursors (e.g. silicon and aluminium alkoxides, etc.) 

solubilised in specific solvents (e.g. water, ethanol, etc.). It also involves the 

addition of nitrates or chlorides of the glass modifiers (e.g. calcium nitrate, etc.) 

to the processing solution and the use of specific catalytic and/or initiator 

conditions (e.g. ammonium hydroxide, etc.). This approach presents a series of 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction 

 

21 

 

advantages compared to the melt-quenching approach, namely: a better 

compositional control; morphological control (e.g. particles, fibers, membranes, 

etc.); lower processing temperatures; among others [54]. 

The main reactions occurring during the sol-gel methodology are the hydrolysis 

of the glass precursors and their subsequent condensation. For the first step to 

occur it is essential the presence of an hydrolyzing medium (e.g. water) in order 

to produce the hydroxides/acids of the glass formers (e.g. silicic acid, aluminium 

hydroxide, etc.). The condensation reaction (second step) occurs between the 

different hydroxides/acids with the release of water molecules. This step is 

usually catalysed by different compounds, e.g. ammonium hydroxide, nitric acid, 

etc. [55]. Depending on the targeted morphology, the methodology can include 

an additional step usually designated as gelation. In this step the colloidal 

solution of particles is aged allowing their condensation into a macroscopic 

system (Figure 5) [14]. 

 

Figure 5: Sol-gel process (https://www.llnl.gov/str/May05/Satcher.html). 

The whole sol-gel methodology is performed at lower temperatures than the 

melt-quenching approach. This characteristic imparts the valuable advantage of 

enabling the preparation of glasses incorporating bioactive compounds (e.g. 

proteins, drugs, etc.) sensitive to high temperatures [56, 57]. Moreover, glasses 

produced by this methodology usually present higher specific surface area and 

bioactivity [58]. 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction 

 

22 

 

4.4 The polymeric component 

 The GICs curing reactions only occurs if the polymeric component 

present significant acidity. Throughout the development and optimization of GIC 

different polymers have been tested in the formulations. As examples, can be 

pointed out PAA, poly (acrylic acid-co-itaconic acid) and poly (acrylic-co-maleic 

acid) with structural formulas presented in Figure 6 [59]. 

 

Poly(acrylic acid) 

  

Poly(acrylic acid-co-itaconic acid) Poly(acrylic-co-maleic acid) 

Figure 6: Polymers already tested in the development of GIC formulations. 

From all the polymeric components tested until today PAA continues to be the 

most used in GIC formulations. This is essentially due to its high acidity, 

availability and lower price when compared to the other tested polymers [59]. 

The PAA molecular weight (Mw) directly influences cement mechanical 

behaviour and the cement paste initial viscosity. GIC mechanical performance 

is enhanced with PAA of high Mw, although, their high viscosity limits the 

homogeneity and mixability of the cement pastes. In this perspective, it is 

important to obtain a compromise between these two properties. The optimal 

formulations are prepared with polymeric components that have the highest Mw 

without significantly affecting the viscosity of the cement paste [60-63]. 

4.5 GIC curing reactions 

GICs are formed when an acid-base reaction occurs between the glass 

powder and an aqueous solution of PAA, creating an inorganic-organic 

interlinked structure. The curing mechanism is composed by two general steps, 

gelation (Figure 7) and maturation. 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction 

 

23 

 

 

Figure 7: GICs curing reactions during the gelation stage [64]. 

During gelation, hydrated protons from the PAA/H2O penetrate the surface of 

the glass particles and attack its basic sites (i.e. cations such as Na+, Ca2+, 

octahedral Al3+, etc.). The cations from the surface layer are leached to the 

cement matrix, promoting the ionic cross-linking of the PAA chains, through 

their carboxylate anions. This step usually occurs under a timeframe of 

approximately, 30 min. During the maturation step the tetrahedral aluminium 

present in the glass particle surface layer is leached under the same type of 

PAA acid attack. The longer timeframe of this maturation step (approximately, 

24h) is attributed to the higher stability of the tetrahedral aluminium that is 

covalently bounded within the glass structure [34, 41, 50, 65-70]. 

4.6 Properties, applications and importance of GICs and its 

constituents 

4.6.1 Properties of GICs 

There are a series of advantages on using GIC as cementation agent of 

different dental restorations, namely: chemical adhesion to tooth; anti-cariogenic 

effect; mechanical behaviour under compression loading; among others. The 

GIC chemical adhesion to the tooth is due to the dentin chemical structure. This 

is one of the main advantages of the GICs and is based on formation of ionic 

cross-links between the PAA carboxylate anions and the Ca2+ from the dentin’s 

hydroxyapatite [71]. Their anti-cariogenic effect is mainly related with the use of 

fluorine in the glass compositions. Fluorine is gradually leached from GIC to the 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction 

 

24 

 

surrounding dentin strengthening the tooth resistance to bacterial proliferation 

[44, 72]. Moreover, it has been proven that GICs are able to act as a fluorine 

reservoir. In this sense GICs are not only leaching fluorine to the surrounding 

tissue but is also able to uptake additional fluorine from the surroundings (e.g. 

toothpastes) [73]. In relation to the mechanical behaviour, Kenny et al reported 

that it depends on the molecular weight (Mw) of PAA [74]. Additionally, the 

powder to liquid ratio [75], concentration of PAA and the use of chelating agents 

also influences the final performance of the GICs. In general, the available 

formulations achieve compressive strengths up to 200 MPa and biaxial flexural 

strengths up to 50 MPa. The ratio of “bound” and “unbounded” water is a 

determinant factor affecting the GIC properties. In fact, the highest is the 

proportion of “unbounded” water the lower is the mechanical performance and 

the GIC general stability. Finally, the glass particle size also influences 

significantly the mechanical behaviour of the GICs and the cement curing 

reactions. The lower the glass particle size, the higher is its surface area and 

lower is the GIC crack deflection [76]. The main drawback of the reduction of 

the particle size is related with the faster setting kinetics. This variation reduces 

the time available to the medical doctor to manipulate the cement paste and to 

apply it at the intervention site. In this sense, it is always desirable to obtain a 

compromise between glass particle size, mechanical properties and GIC setting 

kinetics to develop optimized formulations. 

A number of modifications can be made in the formulations to enhance the GIC 

properties, namely: (1) alternative polymers, as the polyacid component; (2) 

dried polymers blended with the glass and activation by the addition of water; 

(3) ceramic-metal hybrid cements; (4) metal-reinforced cement for enhanced 

mechanical properties; (5) resin-modified GICs (RMGICs) using initiators and 

resins capable of undergoing photochemical polymerization [35, 77]. 

GICs have demonstrated to possess biocompatibility and bioactivity. These 

cements are able to release osteoconductive ions such as calcium and fluoride  

to the surrounding tissue [65]. The incorporation of strontium in the glass 

formulations has been done for several years due to its characteristic 

properties, namely: radiopacifier, antibacterial properties and can help in the 

regeneration of healthy bone. In fact, it has been proven that low doses of 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction 

 

25 

 

strontium (300 mg Kg-1 day-1 of Sr2+ for 9 weeks) can stimulate bone formation 

and inhibit bone resorption in both animal and humans. Strontium has an affinity 

for bone being incorporated by surface exchange and ionic substitution [78]. 

4.6.2 Applications of GICs 

GICs have been tested in the cementation of different biomaterials 

dedicated to the repair or substitution of tooth and bone. Its main application 

area continues to be the dentistry field, where conventional GICs are used to 

cement different types of composites used to repair teeth or as temporary filler 

before the application of a definitive dental restoration. Non-conventional GICs, 

such as the RMGICs have been additionally proposed as definitive dental 

restorations [44, 79-81]. 

Hurrell-Gillingham and co-workers suggest that the main properties of GICs 

(including adhesion to mineralized tissues, minimal exotherm during setting and 

good biocompatibility) enables them to be exploited in the otology field [82]. 

Although, the most relevant and underexploited application of GIC remains to 

be in the orthopaedic field as bone cements [74]. 

4.6.3 Biocompatibility of GICs 

GICs are not bioinert but should be classified as bioactive. Hatton and 

co-workers tested a set of GICs under in vitro cell culture and they 

demonstrated that some GICs are biocompatibility. Although, other studies 

proved that the ions present in GICs namely aluminium and fluoride are 

responsible for the toxicicity of some formulations. These studies also report a 

relation between the toxicity of the formulations and the ionic concentrations 

and culture conditions [83]. 

4.6.4 The importance of GIC cations in the regeneration of tissue 

The GICs have been tested in vivo with encouraging results. The 

formation of bone was observed in some formulations after 6 weeks of 

implantation and being stable during 1 year. In addition, in the short term there 

is an inflammatory response observed in soft tissues adjacent to the GIC. The 

tissue reaction was caused by one or both of the following factors: 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction 

 

26 

 

(i) Reduction of tissue pH due to the acidic PAA. This is the most probable 

cause of tissue necrosis (a damage of the surrounding tissues). 

(ii) Release of free glass particles from the cement to the surrounding tissues. 

This is probably induced by the excess of water originated on the surrounding 

tissue that migrates to the GIC affecting its curing reactions and promoting the 

release of glass particles. Glass particles are known to cause inflammatory 

response in adjacent soft tissues. In surgery (e.g. dentistry), it is important to 

avoid excess of the moisture contamination during placement of the GICs. 

A limited dose of ion release is the significant factor that determines tissue 

response to regeneration. In contrast, as previously mentioned, high levels of 

ionic leaching from the GIC can produce inflammatory response. Upon GIC 

application it is expectable an initial time period where inflammation occurs in 

the surrounding tissue due to higher levels of ionic and PAA leaching from the 

GIC. After this initial timeframe the inflammatory response is suppressed and 

the GIC appears with a layer of relatively mature bone tissue. At this stage the 

osteoconductive potential of the GIC is evident (a property not common in other 

types of bone cements) [83]. 

a) Aluminium and its toxicity 

Aluminium in the ionic form (Al3+) has several implications in human 

health and its toxicity has been studied by several authors. This cation is 

responsible for many degenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s and 

Parkinson’s. Boyce and co-workers reported that encephalopathy and 

osteomalacia was detected in patients being subject to dialysis. It was observed 

that the water used in the dialysis contained high levels of aluminium. Bone 

biopsies detected the presence of high levels of aluminium in the bone, 

confirming that the origin of the detected pathologies was the aluminium present 

in the water used for the dialysis [84]. 

Another case study (a bone reconstruction of a woman with 52 years old) was 

reported by Reusche et al. This reconstruction was performed with a GIC 

prepared by mixing a calcium aluminium fluorosilicate glass and an aqueous 

solution of polycarboxylic acid. This GIC (Ionocem) contained high levels of 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction 

 

27 

 

aluminium and six weeks after implantation the patient presented a fatal 

aluminium encephalopathy (see Figure 8) [85]. 

 

Figure 8: Aluminium inflammatory response of Al-based GICs resulting in an irregular 

density at the specific positions (arrowheads) [85]. 

In general, it has been accepted that the release of aluminium present in the 

GICs formulations, used as bone cements, produces a deleterious effect in the 

health of the intervened patients [85]. Although, this has been considered a 

critical component of the glass compositions used to prepare GICs. In fact, it 

has been proposed that Al3+ has a critical role in the formation of the PAA 

carboxylate cross-links within the GIC cement matrix [86]. Under this 

perspective, Boyd and co-workers tested several aluminium-free glass 

compositions and their cement forming ability. Under these studies the same 

authors found that glass compositions where aluminium was substituted by zinc 

are able to produce GIC. The developed formulations presented properties that 

are consistent with their application in orthopaedic procedures, according to 

ISO5833 [78, 87]. 

b) Other relevant cations 

There are a series of other cations that possess a relevant role in the 

setting chemistry and final properties of the GICs. As stated before, zinc has 

demonstrated that it is able to substitute aluminium in the glass compositions 

used to prepare GICs. Although not completely proven, it is reported that zinc 

imparted other relevant properties to the final GICs, namely: bactericidal and 

bioactivity.  Zinc is also an essential trace element which presents effects on in 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction 

 

28 

 

vitro and in vivo bone formation and bone protein synthesis. It promotes the 

proliferation of osteoblasts and many biological functions. It promotes new bone 

formation in the surroundings of the implants [88]. Additionally, zinc deficiency 

may be a risk factor in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis [89]. 

Their bivalency makes the cations derived from the elements of the second 

group of the periodic table, namely, magnesium, calcium and strontium, suitable 

to act as PAA ionic cross-linkers. In fact, calcium has been described as the 

second most relevant cations in the GIC setting chemistry [90]. It has been 

reported in the glass composition since the initial development of the GICs. Its 

role is similar to aluminium in the cross-linking of the PAA network through 

calcium-carboxylate ionic linkages. Due to their similar characteristic, 

magnesium and strontium have an equivalent potential. In contrast, beryllium 

and barium are usually not included due to their toxicity. 

The nature of strontium and its biological function has not been investigated as 

extensively as the role of calcium and magnesium of the same chemical family. 

Strontium is believed to have a participation in dental tissue mineralization due 

to their properties similar to those presented by calcium. Its antibacterial effect 

has been claimed but remains to be clarified: previous in vitro work on 

commercial RMGIC (Fuji II LC) showed that strontium was not cytotoxic when in 

contact with human osteoblastic cells. Strontium, as a substitute of calcium in 

hydroxyapatite, has been studied recently and claimed to prevent bone 

fractures [90]. In addition, strontium may inhibit osteoclastic turnover and 

promote the osteoblastic one. Moreover, bone strength increases and the risk of 

fractures decrease [91, 92]. It has been also reported to contribute to the 

increase in bone mass and volume when given at low doses, re-mineralizing 

skeletal lesions. It seems that strontium directly suppresses bone resorption 

and has no deleterious effect on bone mineralization. Strontium has also 

reported to have beneficial effects on bone formation in rodents and humans 

which results in increased trabecular volume. It has been also confirmed that 

strontium increases the bone strength and in bone density due to its higher 

atomic weight in comparison with calcium. Strontium is currently used as dopant 

of the crystalline structures of calcium salts to improve their biological 

properties. The successful incorporation of strontium ions in the composition of 



CHAPTER I – General Introduction 

 

29 

 

hydroxyapatite, calcium phosphate cements and calcium silicates help on the 

proliferation and activity of osteoblastic cells [58]. Finally, Johnson et al. studied 

the effect of the incorporation of strontium in GICs. They reported a relation 

between the presence of strontium in the GIC and a marked reduction of bone 

ash; increase in the amount of magnesium and potassium in the bone; and by 

depressed calcium contents as compared to normal bone [93]. 

Drouet et al. studied the effect of strontium and magnesium in the formation of 

apatites. They observed that the magnesium taken up was found to be 

reversibly fixed to the apatite structure independently of their maturation stage. 

In contrast, the amount of reversibly fixed strontium decreased noticeably with 

maturation in a strontium-containing solution. These findings suggested that 

magnesium remained mostly on the surface of nanocrystalline apatites whereas 

strontium was progressively incorporated into the growing apatite domains [94]. 

Magnesium is a cation that presents high physiological interests in the 

biomedical field. It is essential to human metabolism and is naturally present in 

the bone. It may actually have stimulatory effects on the growth of new bone 

and it is classified as an essential element for the human body [88].

This chapter compiles the information relative to the materials used during the 

experimental procedures, and the methodologies employed in the synthesis and 

characterization of the developed GICs. 

1. Materials 
The safety information, purity and supplier of the chemicals used for the glass 

synthesis and in the formulation of the cements are presented in Table 1. Each 

reagent was used at specific proportions to prepare glasses of different 

compositions. The addition of corn starch to the cement formulation was tested in 

an attempt to improve its biodegradability. ?-Amylase was used as a degradation 

catalyser in the starch-containing formulations.

2. Materials synthesis and processing  
2.1 Glass synthesis 

Glass formulations were prepared by mixing the appropriate quantities of the 

glass precursors in a mortar using ethanol as a mixing adjuvant. The final glass 

compositions are detailed in Table 2.

 * Glass composition G1 did not melt at the experimental conditions used under this work. In this 

perspective G1 composition was not used to prepare GICs. 

 

Upon mixing, the formulations were dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 35 ºC [1-

3]. The dried formulations were heated in a crucible to 300 ºC for 30 minutes to 

release the ammonia from the diammonium hydrogen phosphate; 650 ºC for 30 

minutes to allow the release of carbon dioxide from the carbonates; and 1300 ºC 

to allow the complete melting of the mixture [4, 5]. The melted mixtures were 

splat quenched by pouring the melt onto a metal plate maintained at room 

temperature (Figure 1) [6-13].

The glass blocks were frozen with liquid nitrogen and grounded with a pestle and 

mortar (Figure 2). Upon size reduction the glass particles were separated by 

sizes using an Analytical Sieve Shaker (Retsch AS200) for 5 min at a rate of 60 

rpm. With this methodology it was possible to collect the glass fractions that 

presented particle sizes of x&lt;63 µm, 63 µm&lt;x&lt;125 µm and 125 µm&lt;x&lt;250 µm. 

Figure 2: Glass powder preparation and sieving. 

2.2 Cement preparation 

Cement formulations were prepared by mixing the glass powder with PAA and 

water at appropriate amounts (55: 21: 24 by mass). After mixing, the cement 

pastes were introduced into a Teflon mould to produce cylindrical cement 

specimens of 6 mm diameter and 11 mm height (Figure 3). 

 

 
Figure 3: Example of the preparation of a moulded cement formulation. 



CHAPTER II – Materials and methods 

42 

The cement formulation that presented higher mechanical resistance was 

modified in an attempt to enhance its biodegradability. For this purpose it was 

added corn starch to the formulation (5 and 25 % by weight) [14]. 

3. Characterization methodologies    
3.1 Mechanical performance under compression loading    

All the developed cements were mechanically evaluated under compression 

loading. For each formulation it was prepared six cylindrical specimens (as 

detailed in the cement preparation section). The mechanical loading was 

executed on an Instron 5540 (Instron, USA) equipped with a load cell of 1 kN and 

2 mm/min of crosshead speed (Figure 4). In all cases, the samples were 

maintained at room temperature for 24 hours prior to the mechanical testing [15]. 

From the stress-strain curves it was determined the compression modulus (CM) 

and the compressive strength (CS). The compression modulus was determined 

as the initial slope (elastic regime) of the stress-strain curves.

The CS was calculated from equation 1:

where, CS is the compressive strength (MPa), ? is the maximum applied load (N) 

and d is the diameter of the sample (mm) [11, 16, 17]. 

 

3.2 Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy    

The evolution of the acid-base reaction between the glass particles and the PAA 

was followed by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The FTIR 

spectra were acquired on KBr pellets. For this purpose, 400 mg of KBr (Sigma-

Aldrich, &gt;99 % trace metals basis) was mixed with 2-4 mg of sample in a mortar 

and pestle until forming an homogeneous mixture (Figure 5). This mixture was 

moulded to a pellet using a press (Pike, USA). The FTIR spectra were acquired 

on a Shimadzu IR-Prestige 21 spectrometer, under transmittance mode using a 

resolution of 4 cm-1, a range between 4400-400 cm-1 and 32 scans. 

 

 
Figure 5: Preparation of the KBr pellets. 

 

3.3 X-ray powder Diffraction    

The crystalline/amorphous state of the synthesised glasses was evaluated using 

X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) [18]. The diffractograms were collected on a 



CHAPTER II – Materials and methods 

44 

Bruker D8 Discover, operating with CuK radiation, in  ?/2? mode, between 6º and 

70º, with a step increment of 0.04º and an acquisition time of 1s per step. 

3.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy    

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the formation and 

morphology of calcium phosphate layers (in vitro bioactivity) at the surface of the 

cements after immersion in SBF at 7 and 14 days (non-immersed samples were 

used as controls). The micrographs were collected on a Leica Cambridge S360 

microscope using a beam energy of 15.0 kV and a working distance (WD) of 19 

mm. All the analysed samples were previously coated with gold to enhance its 

conductivity (Figure 6). 

 
Figure 6: Gold deposition, microscope chamber and overall view of SEM microscope. 

 

3.5 Micro-Computed Tomography    

The cements samples were analysed by micro-Computed Tomography (micro-

CT) in order to determine the polymer, glass and pore spatial distribution and 

volume percentages. The collection of images was performed in a micro-CT 

Skyscan 1072 (Skyscan, Belgium) operating with a voltage of 104 kV and with a 

current of 96 µA (Figure 7). Upon image acquisition the noise was reduced using 

nRecon software. Afterwards, 200 sliced images were obtained using the CT-An 

program. These images were used to produce a 3D reconstructions with the 

same program (CT-An). Manipulating the image with a threshold of 40 to 80 for 

the glass and 80 to 140 for the polymer it was possible to separate the 

contribution of PAA and glass components to the cement volume, as well as the 

free pore volume [19].

3.6 Water uptake and weigh loss    

3.6.1 Water uptake 

Cement samples (prepared 24 h before testing to allow stabilization) were 

immersed in Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) solution at a ratio of 1:15 (sample 

mass : PBS volume) and inserted in a shaking water bath maintained at 37 ºC 

and 60 rpm. In all the cases it was prepared three replicas of each sample that 

were collected during the study. Cement samples were collected at various time 

points (1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks) and were washed with distilled water. The 

excess of water present in the surface of the cements was dried with paper and 

then the cements were immediately weighted. 

The water uptake (WU) was calculated using the following equation [20]: 

 

Equation 2 

where, mtp is the mass of the wet specimen at a specific time point and mf is the 

mass of cement after drying at 37 ºC to constant weight. 

 

 



CHAPTER II – Materials and methods 

46 

3.6.2 Weight loss 

The weight loss (WL) was calculated during the water uptake (WU) tests. In the 

WL case, the cements were removed from the PBS solution at the same time 

intervals as the ones used for the WU (1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks) and were dried in 

the oven, at 37 ºC, until constant weight. The percentage of WL was calculated 

using the following equation: 

 

Equation 3 

where, mf is the mass of the dried cement after its immersion in PBS and mi is 

the mass of the dried cement before immersion in PBS. 

 

4. Bioactivity assays    
4.1 Preparation of Simulated Body Fluid and the cements 
samples    

Simulated body fluid (SBF) is a solution that mimics the ion concentrations in the 

human plasma, as indicated in Table 3.

The preparation of SBF followed a specific protocol as detailed in the following 

steps:  

• 1 L of distilled water was maintained in a bath at the temperature of 100 

ºC-150 ºC and at 300-450 rpm; 

• It was performed a temperature and pH control; 

• The masses of each reagent was added in the order described in Table 4 

to produce 2 L of SBF; 

• The temperature of the solution was adjusted to 36.5 ºC and the pH to 

7.40; 

• The solution was transferred to a volumetric flask and the volume was 

adjusted when the temperature reached 20 ºC; 

• After sterilization by filtration, the solution was stored at 5-10 ºC.

4.2 Bioactivity assay  

Cement samples (prepared 24 h before testing to allow stabilization) were 

immersed in Simulated Body Fluid (SBF) solution at a ratio of 1:10 (sample mass 

: SBF volume) and inserted into an oven maintained at 37 ºC. Cement samples 

(including three replicas per formulation and time point) were collected at two 

time points (7 and 14 days). The collected SBF solutions were filtered and stored 

in a controlled temperature room at 4 ºC until further analysis.

4.3 Analysis of calcium and phosphorous concentration by 
inductive coupled plasma – optical emission spectroscopy    

Inductive coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used to 

determine the calcium and phosphorous concentrations in the SBF solution 

before and after the immersion of the developed cements at 7 and 14 weeks 

(Figure 8). The higher ability of the cement to form a calcium phosphate layer in 

the surface of the cement (a measure of its in vitro bioactivity), higher is the 

reduction of the calcium and phosphorous concentrations in the SBF. The 

analytical methodology comprises the nebulisation of the SBF solutions into an 

oven maintained at a temperature between 6000 and 10000 K to atomize the 

chemical compounds. Afterwards, the samples’ absorption at specific 

wavelengths (? =422.67 nm for Ca and ? =213.62 nm for P) was measured and 

the Ca and P concentrations were determined using calibration curves previously 

obtained with standard solutions (Alfa Aesar). 

 

Figure 8: ICP-OES analysis of the developed cements. 

 

4.4 Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy    

The Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) was used to analyse the 

surface elemental composition of the prepared cement samples before and after 

immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) – bioactivity assays. For this purpose, a 

Link eXL-II Oxford spectroscope was used at an energy of 7.0 KeV. The EDS 

analysis was used to quantify the calcium and phosphorous present in the 

surface of the cements after immersion during 7 and 14 days in SBF. Prior to the 

analysis the samples were carbon coated to improve their conductivity (Figure 9).

5. Degradation studies    
The kinetics and percentage of cement degradation are important parameters to 

evaluate their suitability as bone cements. In fact, it is expectable that the 

developed cements will be slowly reabsorbed and excreted from the body. The 

kinetics of this process should match the formation of new bone so that the loss 

of the cementing effect of the reabsorbed part will not impart a reduction of 

properties in the intervened portion of the bone. In this perspective, it was 

analysed the kinetics and percentages of weight loss of the developed cements 

(see water uptake and weight loss in section 3 of this chapter). Additionally, the 

degradation kinetics of the cements prepared with the addition of starch particles 

were analysed in the presence of a starch-specific enzyme, ?-amylase. 

5.1 Enzymatic degradation – reducing sugars    

The degradation of the starch-containing cements was tested in the presence of 

a starch-specific enzyme, ?-amylase. This enzyme is known to hydrolyse the ?-

1,4-glycosidic linkages of polysaccharides (e.g. starch) to monosaccharides, 

such as, maltose and dextrins (scheme 1).

Cement degradation was promoted by immersion of specimens in an enzyme 

containing solution (150 U/L) for different time periods, 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 

weeks. At the specific time points, the solutions were analysed for the presence 

of reducing sugars. Their concentration was determined by the dinitrosalicylic 

acid (DNS) method. The 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid is converted to 3-amino-5-

nitrosalicylic acid in alkaline conditions according to the reaction 1.

This last compound (3-amino-5-nitrosalicylic acid) forms a complex with the 

reducing sugars, which presents an absorption peak at 540 nm. All the 

immersion solutions were analyzed in a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (microplate 

reader Synergie HT). Previous to the analysis a calibration curve was obtained 

using standard solutions of dextrose (Sigma-Aldrich), allowing the determination 

of the concentration of reducing sugars present in the immersion solutions. 

6. Statistical methods    
6.1 Dixon test (Q-test) 

The Dixon test is an outlier test that informs if the minimum or the maximum 

value of a dataset from the same formulation may be rejected or not. The test is 

based on equation 4 and 5 and was used in the datasets obtained from the 

mechanical analysis. 

 

, for the minimum value Equation 4 



CHAPTER II – Materials and methods 

51 

 

, for the maximum value Equation 5 

Where the data values are: x1, x2, x3 . . . xn-1, xn. 

Considering a specific probability (in our case 95 %) the Qtabulated is selected from 

the corresponding statistical table. If the Qcalculated&lt;Qtabulated the value was not 

rejected within the given probability and if the Qcalculated&gt;Qtabulated the value was 

rejected within the given probability. 

6.2 Normality test    

All the described statistics can only be applied if the datasets follow a normal 

distribution. Considering this fact, all the datasets were tested for normality using 

the Shapiro-Wilk analysis. This test indicates if the dataset is normally distributed 

at a 95 % probability. Considering the normal distribution, if the p-value was less 

than 0.05, it was considered that the dataset was not significantly drawn from a 

normally distributed population and if the p-value was higher than 0.05 the 

dataset was considered to be significantly drawn from a normally distributed 

population (Figure 10). All the tested datasets were in accordance with the 

normal distribution making it possible to perform a significance test (t-test) [21].

http://www.conferences.utah.edu/ishpssb/publicforum.html). 



CHAPTER II – Materials and methods

6.3 t-test    

With the t-test it was possible to analyse if the differences between the averages 

of the datasets are significantly or not. The t-test was employed in the analysis of 

the datasets obtained from the mechanical analysis, namely from the 

compressive strength (CS) and modulus (CM) of the cements. A comparison of 

the averages of the datasets is done considering a null hypothesis (mean1-

mean2=0). From the results it was possible to conclude if the differences 

between the averages are significant or not within a 95 % probability.

Abstract 

Glass ionomer cements (GICs) are used in dentistry and their application as 

bone cements have been mainly limited by the presence of cytotoxic aluminium 

(Al) in the glass composition. We developed Al-free glasses of general 

composition 0.340SiO2: 0.300ZnO: (0.250-x-y)CaO: xSrO: yMgO: 0.050Na2O: 

0.060P2O5 (x, y = 0.000 or 0.125) and tested them for their cement forming 

ability in the presence of polyacrylic acid (PAA) and water. The influence of the 

type of cations present in the glass (Ca2+, Sr2+ and Mg2+); the PAA molecular 

weight (Mw) and the glass particle size in the cement final properties 

(mechanical behaviour and bioactivity) were evaluated. Enhanced compressive 

strength (25±5 MPa) and modulus (492±17 MPa) was achieved with PAA of 50 

kDa and glass particle sizes between 63-125 µm. The GICs’ in vitro bioactivity 

was tested in simulated body fluid (SBF) and their response analysed by ICP, 

SEM and EDS. Enhanced bioactivity was observed for glass composition 

x=0.125; y=0.000, presenting a surface calcium (Ca)/ phosphorous (P) ratio of 

1.6 (similar to hydroxylapatite) and a surface morphology consistent with a CaP 

coating. Starch was added to the cement formulation x=0.125; y=0.000 (at 

0.050 and 0.250 weight proportions) in order to enhance its biodegradability 

(tested by immersion in phosphate buffer saline in the presence of ?-amylase). 

The results obtained from the determination of the reducing sugars in the 

degradation solution indicate that starch only starts to degrade after 8 weeks of 

immersion. Our studies indicate that it is possible to formulate Al-free GIC 

compositions with potential to be used as bone cements.

1. Introduction 

Wilson and Kent created the first glass-ionomer cement (GIC), in the early 

1970s [1, 2]. GICs are prepared through the mixing of a glass powder, usually a 

calcium fluoroaluminosilicate, with polyacrylic acid (PAA) and water. The curing 

reactions usually occur in two phases designated as gelation and maturation 

[3]. During gelation the acidic PAA attacks the glass particles at their basic 

sites, promoting the release of cations, e.g. 5-coordinated and 6-coordinated 

aluminium (Al) in the ionic form Al3+, Ca2+, etc., from the glass to the cement 

matrix [4]. This process is followed by the maturation phase that includes the 

leaching of covalently bounded 4-coordinated Al (slower process due to its 

more stable position in the glass structure) and the ionic cross-linking of the 

PAA chains by the leached cations. These two cements curing phases 

generates the final GIC structure - a composite of cross-linked PAA reinforced 

with the reacted glass particles [5]. 

Initial application of this type of cements was in dentistry due to their unique 

properties, namely, its strong adhesion to the hydroxylapatite present in dentin 

and its anti-cariogenic potential [1, 6-8]. Initial drawbacks of conventional GICs 

comprised, e.g. sensitivity to moisture during initial hardening, poor mechanical 

properties, among others. Optimization of their formulations resulted in 

conventional and modified GICs (e.g. resin-modified GICs) with enhanced 

behaviour [9, 10]. GICs continue to be mainly applied in the dentistry field, 

although, some tests have been made to use them as bone cements. These 

attempts revealed to be unsuccessful due to Al cytotoxicity present in the glass 

composition and in the cement matrix [11, 12]. More recently, a series of studies 

[13-15] have been dedicated to eliminate Al from the cement formulation in 

order to avoid its deleterious cytotoxic effect. In fact, Towler and co-workers 

already shown that Al-free glass particles of the ternary system calcium-zinc-

silicates [16] and quaternary system calcium-strontium-zinc-silicates [17, 18] 

possess cement-forming ability. These glass compositions always included low 

calcium/strontium fractions (cumulative values below 0.16) limiting the glass 

reactivity towards the PAA. In this study we hypothesise that: 1) the increase of 

the glass basic sites might increment the glass reactivity inducing an 

enhancement of the GIC mechanical behaviour; 2) the inclusion of higher 

fractions of CaO/SrO/MgO might improve the GIC in vitro bioactivity; 3) it is

60 

 

expectable that the type of divalent cations (group II) included in the glass 

formulations (i.e. Ca2+, Sr2+ and Mg2+) will influence the cement final properties 

(e.g. mechanical behaviour, bioactivity, etc.); and 4) the addition of starch to the 

cement formulation improves the GIC biodegradability. 

 

2. Materials and methods 

2.1 Materials – Glass synthesis 

Glass formulations of general formula 0.340SiO2: 0.300ZnO: (0.250-x-y)CaO: 

xSrO: yMgO: 0.050Na2O: 0.060P2O5 (where x and y = 0.125 or 0.000) were 

prepared by melt quenching using appropriate proportions of glass precursors 

(Table 1). For this purpose, silica (Merck), zinc oxide (Sigma), magnesium oxide 

(Sigma, 98 %), calcium carbonate (Sigma, 99 %), strontium carbonate (Sigma, 

98 %), sodium hidrogenocarbonate (Riedel de-Haen, 99.7 %) and diamonnium 

hidrogenophosphate (Sigma, 98 %) were grounded with a pestle and mortar 

transferred to a crucible and fired to 300 ºC to release ammonia, 650 ºC to allow 

the release of carbon dioxide and to 1300 ºC to produce the melt.

Glass blocks were immersed in liquid nitrogen and grounded with a pestle and 

mortar. The glass particles were separated by size using an Analytical Sieve 

Shaker (Retsch AS200) for 5 min at 60 rpm. With this procedure it was possible 

to collect three different fractions (with particle of sizes&amp;lt;63 µm, between 63-125 

µm and between 125-250 µm) for each glass composition.

2.2 Cement preparation 

Cements were prepared mixing the glass powder with PAA and water at 

appropriate proportion (55: 21: 24 by mass). PAA of different molecular weights 

(Mws) were tested, namely, 50 kDa (PolySciences); 450 kDa (Sigma-Aldrich) 

and 1250 kDa (Sigma-Aldrich). The cement formulation that presented higher 

mechanical performance was modified to enhance its biodegradability. To this 

purpose it was added corn starch (Sigma) to formulations in weight percentages 

of 5 % and 25 %. All the cement pastes (immediately after mixing) were shaped 

in a Teflon mould to produce cylindrical specimens of 6 mm diameter and 11 

mm height. 

 

2.3 Glass and cement characterization 

2.3.1 X-Ray Diffraction 

The crystalline/amorphous state of the synthesized glass formulations was 

evaluated by x-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Diffractograms were collected on a 

Bruker D8 Discover, operating with Cu K? radiation, in ?/2? mode, between 6° 

and 70°, with a step increment of 0.04° and an acqu isition time of 1 s per step. 

2.3.2 Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy 

 The Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra of the glasses and cements 

were collected using KBr (Sigma, 99%+) pellets on a Shimadzu IR-Prestige 21 

spectrometer under transmittance mode, between 4400-400 cm-1, using a 

resolution of 4 cm-1 and 32 scans. 

2.3.3 Mechanical testing 

 The compressive strength (CS) and modulus (CM) of the cements were 

evaluated. The developed cement formulations were mechanically tested under 

compression loading on an Instron 5540 (Instron, USA) using a 1 kN load cell 

and 2 mm/min of crosshead speed. Six cylindrical specimens of each 

formulation were tested 1 day after preparation. The specimen compressive 

strength (CS) was calculated according to equation 1: 

 

(1) 

where ? is the maximum applied load (N) and d is the diameter of the sample 

(mm). 



CHAPTER III – Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability 

 

62 

 

The compressive modulus (CM) was calculated as the initial slope (elastic 

regime) of the stress-strain curves of each cement specimen. 

Averages were calculated for the CS and CM of each cement formulation 

and the normality of the data distribution was confirmed using the Shapiro-Wilk 

test. Significant differences (95 % probability) between the cement formulations 

were calculated using the t-test. 

 

2.4 Bioactivity tests 

2.4.1 In vitro bioactivity 

 Cement formulations were immersed in Simulated Body Fluid (SBF, prepared 

according to a previously established procedure [14]) during 7 and 14 days. At 

these specific time points, the specimens were collected from the solutions. The 

calcium (Ca) and phosphorous (P) concentrations of the initial SBF and 

immersion solutions were analyzed by Inductive Coupled Plasma – Optical 

Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and the elemental composition and 

morphology of the immersed and non-immersed cement surfaces were 

evaluated by Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Scanning 

Electron Microscopy (SEM). 

2.4.2 Inductive coupled plasma – optical emission spectroscopy 

ICP-OES was used to determine the Ca and P concentrations in the SBF 

solutions before and after the immersion of the developed cements. The 

samples’ absorption at specific wavelengths (? =422.67 nm for Ca and 

? =213.62 nm for P) was measured and the Ca and P concentrations were 

determined from the calibration curves previously obtained with standard 

solutions (Alfa Aesar). 

2.4.3 Energy-Dispersive x-ray Spectroscopy 

 The Energy-Dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used to quantify the 

Ca and P present in the surface of the cements. A Link eXL-II Oxford 

Spectroscope was used at an energy of 7.0 keV and the samples were carbon 

coated to improve their conductivity. 

2.4.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy 

 Micrographs of the cement samples were collected on a Leica Cambridge 

S360 microscope using a beam energy of 15.0 kV and a working distance (WD) 



CHAPTER III – Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability 

 

63 

 

of 19 mm. All the samples were previously coated with gold and the morphology 

of the CaP layers was verified after 7 and 14 days of immersion in SBF. 

 

2.5 Water uptake and weigh loss 

Cement samples (prepared 24 h before testing) were immersed in Phosphate 

Buffer Saline (PBS) solution at a ratio of 1:15 (sample mass: PBS volume) and 

inserted in a shaking water bath maintained at 37 ºC and 60 rpm. Cement 

samples were collected at various time points (1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks). They 

were washed with distilled water, the excess water present in the surface was 

dried with paper and the samples were immediately weighted. The water uptake 

(WU) was calculated using the equation 2. 

 

 
(2) 
 

where, mtp is the wet mass at the specific time point and mf is the mass of 

cement after drying at 37 ºC to constant weight. 

The weight loss (WL) was calculated during the water uptake (WU) tests. In 

the WL case, the cements were removed from the PBS solution at the same 

time intervals as the ones used for the WU (1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks) and were 

dried into the oven, at 37 ºC, until constant weight. The percentage of WL was 

calculated using the equation 3. 

 

 
(3) 
 

where, mf is the mass of the dried cement after its immersion in PBS and mi is 

the mass of the cement before immersion in PBS. 

 

2.6 Degradation tests  

The degradation of the starch-containing cements was tested in the presence 

of a starch-specific enzyme, ?-amylase. This enzyme is known to hydrolyse the 

?-1,4-glycosidic linkages of polysaccharides (e.g. starch) to monosaccharides, 

such as, maltose and dextrins. 

Cement degradation was promoted by immersion of specimens in an enzyme 

containing solution (150 U/L) for different time periods, 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 



CHAPTER III – Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability 

 

64 

 

weeks. At the specific time points, the solutions were analysed for the presence 

of reducing sugars. Their concentration was determined by the dinitrosalicylic 

acid (DNS) method. The 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid is converted to 3-amino-5-

nitrosalicylic acid in alkaline conditions. This last compound (3-amino-5-

nitrosalicylic acid) forms a complex with the reducing sugars, which presents an 

absorption peak at 540 nm. All the immersion solutions were analyzed in a UV-

VIS spectrophotometer (microplate reader Synergie HT). Previous to the 

analysis a calibration curve was obtained using standard solutions of dextrose 

(Sigma-Aldrich, nd), allowing the determination of the concentration of reducing 

sugars present in the immersion solutions. 

 

2.7 Micro-Computed Tomography 

The cement samples were analysed by micro-Computed Tomography (micro-

CT) in order to determine the polymer, glass and pore spatial distributions and 

volume percentages. The collection of images was performed in a micro-CT 

Skyscan 1072 (Skyscan, Belgium) operating with a voltage of 104 kV and with a 

current of 96 µA. Upon image acquisition the noise was reduced using nRecon 

software. Afterwards, 200 sliced images were obtained using the CT-An 

program. These images were used to produce a 3D reconstruction with the 

same program (CT-An). Manipulating the image with a threshold of 40 to 80 for 

the glass and 80 to 140 for the polymer it was possible to separate the 

contribution of these components to the cement volume, as well as the free 

pore volume. 

 
3. Results and discussion 

3.1 Glass characterization 

3.1.1 X-Ray Diffraction 

The XRD diffractograms of all the synthesised glass compositions presents 

the predominance of the amorphous state with a low contribution of crystalline 

phases only in the cases of samples G4 and G6 (see Figure 1).

3.2 Cement characterization 

3.2.1. Chemical characterization 

 FTIR spectra of the cement samples (cured during 24 h) were used to 

characterize their curing reactions and chemical structure. As an example, 

Figure 2 presents the FTIR spectra of PAA, glass G5 and cement C5.

It is known that the cement curing reactions comprises an acid attack 

promoted by the PAA carboxylic acids on the surface layer of the glass particles 

that partially leaches its cations to the cement matrix. These leached cations 

crosslink the polymeric chains (at the COO- groups from the PAA) through the 

formation of ionic linkages [3]. In fact, the PAA, glass and cement FTIR spectra 



CHAPTER III – Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability 

 

66 

 

(Figure 2) are consistent with this reaction model. Upon acid attack the PAA 

COOH stretching at 1750 cm-1 (observed before the curing reaction) is shifted 

to two peaks (symmetric and asymmetric stretching between 1640 cm-1 and 

1550 cm-1) of its ionized form (COO-). 

 

3.2.2 Mechanical testing 

a) Influence of glass particle size and PAA molecular weight on the cement 

mechanical behaviour. 

 The influence of the glass particle size and the PAA molecular weight (Mw) 

on the mechanical behaviour of the cement (CS and CM) was also studied. To 

this purpose, three glass powder fractions (using G5) with different particle size 

distributions were obtained by sieving (i.e.&amp;lt;63 µm; 63 µm&lt;x&lt;125 µm and 125 

µm&lt;x&lt;250 µm) and three PAA samples of different Mws (50 kDa, 450 kDa and 

1250 kDa) were tested. The CS and CM values obtained with the cements 

prepared with the sieved glass powders and the PAA samples of different Mw 

are presented in Figure 3.

Figure 3: Compressive modulus (CM) and compressive strength (CS) of the cements 

prepared with the different particle sizes of glass powder and PAA Mws. 
 

Higher CS and CM values were obtained using PAA of 50 kDa and glass 

particle sizes between 63 µm and 125 µm. In all the cases, when the glass 

particle size distribution or PAA Mw deviated from these optimal conditions, CM 

decreased significantly. In the case of the CS, not always it was observed a 

significant decrease, although, it was clear that the above mentioned optimal 

conditions yielded a cement formulation with enhanced CS [19, 20]. 

It was observed that a proper mixing of the cement paste would necessitate 

more water when the glass particle sizes are&amp;lt;63 µm. Although, other reports 



CHAPTER III – Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability 

 

67 

 

[21] suggest that lower particle sizes would be beneficial for the cement 

mechanical properties. From our results it is possible to conclude that this 

relation is not universal and that the optimal glass particle sizes might vary with 

the glass composition. In fact, it is reasonable to assume that the higher the 

reactivity of the glass particles the higher should be the glass particle sizes (and 

consequently lower the surface area). If low particle sizes are used on glasses 

with high reactivity towards PAA their reaction is so fast that it is not possible to 

produce an homogeneous cement paste. In these cases the cement’s working 

time is too short to allow its application in the cementation of bone and to yield 

enhanced mechanical performance. 

 

b) Influence of the composition of each cement in the mechanical behaviour 

 In Figure 4 is presented the CM and CS obtained for the cement 

formulations prepared using the synthesised glasses (with particle size between 

63 and 125 µm), PAA (50 kDa) and water.

Figure 4: Compressive modulus (CM) and compressive strength (CS) of the developed 

cements. 
 

Analysing the results obtained for the CM values it is clear the existence of 

two groups of formulations: group 1 composed by C4 and C6 that present lower 

CM; and group 2 composed by C2, C3 and C5 that exhibit higher CM. No 

significant differences were observed within each group, although, significant 

variations (95 % probability) were observed between the samples of the two 

groups. It is interesting to notice that lower CM is obtained for the cements 

prepared with glasses that presented MgO in the composition. 

The mechanical analysis was complemented with the determination of the 

CS of the same cement formulations. From the three cements that presented 



CHAPTER III – Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability 

 

68 

 

higher CM (C2, C3 and C5) the only one that presented a significantly higher 

mechanical resistance was C5. Overall, it presented a CM of 492±17 MPa and 

a CS of 25±5 MPa. 

 

3.2.3 In vitro bioactivity 

 The ability of the cements to promote the formation of calcium phosphate 

(CaP) layers on their surface (in the presence of SBF) was used as a measure 

of their in vitro bioactivity. At a first stage cement samples were immersed in 

SBF for 7 and 14 days. ICP-OES was used to monitor the Ca and P 

concentration in the SBF solution before and after the cement immersion. Table 

2 summarizes the Ca and P concentrations as percentage of the concentration 

in the original SBF. 

 

Table 2: Ca and P concentrations in the SBF solutions after 7 and 14 days of 

immersion of GIC samples. Values are presented as percentage of the concentrations 

present in the original SBF, used as reference. 

 

 7 days 14 days 
Samples % Ca % P % Ca % P 
SBF 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 
C2 63.04 62.96 64.13 59.26 
C3 21.74 51.85 21.74 51.85 
C4 52.17 40.74 57.61 40.74 
C5 42.39 55.56 40.22 48.15 
C6 18.48 51.85 20.65 59.26 

 

 The results clearly show a decrease of the Ca and P concentrations in the 

SBF for all the cement samples. The larger variations on the Ca were observed 

for C3 and C6, although, these are not accompanied by the P concentrations. In 

fact, the reduction in the P (concentrations between 40 % and 63 %) are 

levelled in all the cement formulations. In this case it is not noticed any specific 

trends. 

 ICP-OES of the immersion solution is an indirect method to determine the 

ability of the cements to produce CaP. The direct analysis of the elemental 

composition of the surfaces of the cements (after immersion in SBF for 7 and 14 

days) was done using EDS (Figure 5).

(spectrum of non-immersed cement shown as reference – 0 days). 
 

From the EDS spectra it was possible to collect the Ca and P concentrations 

in the cement surfaces (Table 3). It is known that biomaterials with high 

bioactivity present thicker CaP layers and these layers present the 

hydroxyapatite crystalline form. It is also known that the Ca/P ratio for 

hydroxyapatite is, approximately, 1.62 [22, 23]. In this perspective, the closer 

the Ca/P ratio is to the hydroxyapatite ratio the higher is the bioactivity of the 

cement. Under this assumption, the cement sample C5 presented Ca/P ratios of 

1.8 and 1.6 at 7 and 14 days of immersion in SBF, respectively. From all the 

tested formulations, the C5 Ca/P values were the closest to hydroxyapatite, 

being considered as the one that presented highest bioactivity.

 In order to complement the analysis, SEM was used to monitor the 

morphology of the CaP layers (cement C5 presented in Figure 6 as an 

example). 

 
Figure 6: SEM micrographs of cement C5 before and after immersion in SBF for 7 and 

14 days. 
 

 SEM analysis demonstrated the change in the cement morphology upon SBF 

immersion. Before immersion the cement surface is smooth without CaP 

crystals, while after 7 and 14 days of immersion it is possible to observe the 

formation of CaP layers that in some cases present the cauliflower form, 

characteristic of hydroxyapatite. 

 Considering the in vitro bioactivity and mechanical testing results it was clear 

that cement C5 exhibited properties that best match their use as bone cement. 

In this perspective, this composition was selected for subsequent analysis and 

testing. 

 

3.2.4 3D distribution of glass, PAA and porosity of C5 cement 

 Micro-CT was used to obtain the spatial distribution of the glass particles, 

PAA and porosity of the cement sample that exhibited higher mechanical 

performance and bioactivity (C5). 

 The analysis of the C5 micrographs (Figure 8) indicates a higher 

predominance of PAA in the surface of the cement than in the bulk. This is 

assigned to the moulding process executed for all the formulations before the 

analysis. Additionally, using the micrographs it was possible to determine the 

porosity of the cement samples. In the case of cement C5 it was calculated a 

porosity of, approximately, 35 % in volume.

3.2.5 Water uptake and weight loss 

The cement that presented higher mechanical performance and bioactivity 

(C5) was again chosen to study the water uptake and weight loss of this type of 

cement formulations. In this case, C5 presented an initial water uptake of 22 % 

that stabilised 1 week after immersion, reaching a plateau between 22 % and

3.3 Addition of starch to the cement formulation  

3.3.1 Mechanical testing 

Cement sample C5 was prepared with two different percentages of starch (5 

% and 25 %). As expected the incorporation of starch as filler in the cement 

formulations produced a decrease of its mechanical performance (see Figure 

7).

as a function of the percentage of starch in the formulations. 

 

It is always observed a significant decrease on the CS and CM when starch 

is included in the formulation. In the case of CM this decrease is limited to, 

approximately, 20 % when 5 % of starch is added, although, when higher 

percentages of starch are used the reduction of CM is higher than 65 %. CS is 

more sensitive to the inclusion of starch. In fact, the addition of 5 % of starch 

produced a decrease of, approximately, 50 % of the CS of the initial cement 

formulation.

3.3.2 3D distribution of the glass, polymers and porosity on the starch-

containing cements 

The 3D micrograph of the C5 cement with 0 %, 5 % and 25 % of starch is 

presented in Figure 8. It is clearly noticed a reduction of the PAA domains 

(lighter regions) in the surface of the cement with the increase of starch content. 

In fact, it was observed an increase of viscosity of the cement paste with the 

addition of starch. Under these conditions it is expectable a lower mobility of the 

PAA during the moulding process, limiting its diffusion to the surface of the 

cement.

and with 5 % and 25 % of starch. 

 

With the acquired micrographs it was also possible to determine the porosity 

of the cement samples. The inclusion of starch into the cement formulation 

produced an increase of porosity from, approximately, 35 %  to 43 %. It is clear 

that the packing of the starch particles within the cement structure induces the 

appearance of a significant free-volume that is the responsible for the increment 

of the cement porosity. When the starch percentage was increased from 5 % to 

25 % no significant variations in the porosity was observed. In fact, the porosity 

is maintained within the 41 % and 42 % range. 

 

3.3.3 Water uptake and weight loss 

 The WU and WL of the C5 cement with 0 %, 5 % and 25 % of starch was 

determined through the immersion of the cement samples in PBS (at the 



CHAPTER III – Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability 

 

73 

 

physiological pH, 7.4) during different time periods (up to 12 weeks). The 

solution pH value was monitored throughout the experiment. It was observed a 

reduction of the pH from the initial 7.4 to 7.0. This result was attributed to the 

partial solubilisation of the PAA present in the cement formulations. 

 In relation to the WU all the cements presented a similar general trend. It is 

observed an initial uptake during the first week (between 20 % and 37 %) that is 

maintained throughout the timeframe of the experiment (Figure 9). The inclusion 

of starch in the cement composition increased the hydrophilicity of the cements 

and their WU values change from, approximately, 25 % (C5 without starch) to 

28 % (C5+5 % starch) and 35 % (C5+25 % starch). The enzymatic environment 

did not induce any observable differences in the WU of the cements when 

compared to the cements immersed in PBS without ?-amylase.

The WLs of the cement C5 with and without the addition of starch are similar 

(Figure 10). In fact it is observed an initial WL between 10 % and 16 % during 

the first week of experiment that is maintained throughout all the timeframe of 

the experiment. Comparing the WL values after 12 weeks of immersion, the 

observable differences between the samples are not significant (between 11 % 

and 13 % of WL). When the same formulations were immersed in PBS solution 

in the presence of ?-amylase it was expectable to observe a higher decrease of 

WLs in the starch containing formulations. Although, the results indicate that the 

enzymatic medium has an inhibitory effect on the processes that are 

responsible for the WL of the GICs.

In fact, it is clear from our results that the WL is reduced to approximately half 

when enzymatic medium is used. Under these not expectable results, it is 

relevant to evaluate if the starch is actually degrading into reducing sugars or 

not. 

3.3.4 Degradation tests 

Starch was added to cement C5 in order to enhance the cement 

degradability, although, WL studies under enzymatic medium showed that the 

cement WLs were diminished. In this perspective the enzyme activity and starch 

degradation rate was monitored through the measurement of the concentration 

of reducing sugars released from the cements into the PBS.

The concentration of the reducing sugars increased as a function of time after 

the 8 and 12 weeks and no significant differences were observed for the 

cements in the first three time points (1, 2 and 4 weeks) (see figure 11). 

Apparently, the starch particles are only in contact with the enzymatic medium 

after the eighth week of immersion. Until this time point it they appear to be 

entrapped in the GIC structure without any connection with the immersion 

solution. 

Considering the increasing of the concentration of reducing sugars in the 

enzymatic medium (after the 8th week of immersion) there is a clear indication 

that the addition of starch to the GIC formulations induces an enhanced 

biodegradability at a larger timeframe than expectable. 

 

4. Conclusions 

 Our results demonstrate that it was possible to prepare Al-free glass-ionomer 

cement formulations using glasses of general formula 0.340SiO2: 0.300ZnO: 

(0.250-x-y)CaO: xSrO: yMgO: 0.050Na2O: 0.060P2O5 (where x and y = 0.000 or 

0.125). The inclusion of MgO revealed not appropriate for the achievement of 

cement with enhanced mechanical performance and bioactivity. Although, the 

combination of SrO and CaO (G5, x= 0.125; y= 0.000) produced a glass 

composition that generated cements with enhanced mechanical performance 

(CS=25±5 MPa and CM=492±17 MPa) and bioactivity (Ca/P= 1.6), with limited 

WU (approximately, 20 %) and WL (approximately, 13 %).  

The optimized C5 cement formulation presented porosities in the range of 35 

% that could be increased to 43 % with the inclusion of starch in the cement 

formulation. Moreover, the presence of reducing sugars in the enzymatic 

degradation solution after 8 weeks of testing indicates the existence of 

improved biodegradability at a longer timeframe than expected. 

Our work demonstrates that it is possible to design Al-free glass-ionomer 

cement formulations that exhibit suitable mechanical performance and 

bioactivity. The elimination of the Al from the glass generates cement 

formulations suitable to be used as bone cements. The collected data is also 



CHAPTER III – Aluminum-free glass ionomer bone cements with enhanced bioactivity and biodegradability 

 

76 

 

consistent with the possibility to develop formulations with improved 

biodegradability if starch (up to 25 %) is added to the cement formulation.

Aluminium-free GICs were developed through the combination of PAA, 

water and glass formulations of general formula 0.340SiO2 : 0.300ZnO : (0.250-

x-y)CaO : xSrO : yMgO : 0.050Na2O : 0.060P2O5 (x, y = 0.125 or 0.000). Their 

mechanical performance was evaluated yielding compressive strengths (CS) 

and moduli (CM) between 11 MPa - 25 MPa and 227 MPa – 492 MPa, 

respectively. Highest results (CS = 25 MPa; CM = 492 MPa) were obtained with 

glass composition 0.340SiO2 : 0.300ZnO : 0.125CaO : 0.125SrO : 0.050Na2O : 

0.060P2O5, a glass particle size between 63 µm&lt;x&lt;125 µm and a PAA Mw of 50 

kDa. 

The PAA and glass distribution within the GIC samples was studied by micro-

CT, revealing that the PAA is mainly in the outer surface of the GICs while the 

reacted glass particles are homogeneous distributed throughout its bulk. This 

PAA migration to the surface of the samples may be a consequence of the 

pressures promoted by the moulding process. Additionally, this observation is 

also consistent with the higher mobility of the PAA (compared to the glass 

particles) within the cement paste before final curing. 

The in vitro bioactivity of the developed GICs was evaluated by a series of 

techniques (ICP of the immersion SBF solutions and EDS/SEM of the cement 

surface before and after immersion). In all the cases they demonstrated the 

GICs’ ability to promote the formation of a calcium phosphate layer at their 

surface. 

Finally, in an attempt to impart biodegradability to the GICs, they were 

formulated with the addition of starch at weight percentages of 5% and 25%. 

The porosity of the developed starch containing GICs (determined by micro-CT) 

was in the range of 35% to 43%. Additionally, when no enzyme was used in the 

immersion solutions the samples’ WL were similar to the control sample (0% 

starch), although, unexpectedly, when an enzymatic medium was used a lower 

WL was recorded. A possible explanation for the lower WL observed with the 

samples subject to enzymatic medium is related with the inhibition of the 

processes that induce the WL of the GICs (e.g. 0% starch). These processes 

might comprise the partial solubilisation of PAA and leaching of cations from the 

glass particles and cement matrix to the immersion solution. 



CHAPTER IV – General conclusions &amp;amp; Future research 

 

82 

 

Under these circumstances it was not possible to conclude about the starch 

containing GICs degradation from the observed WLs. In this perspective, the 

determination of the concentration of reducing sugars was executed and 

confirmed their increasing presence after 8 weeks of immersion. These results 

provided evidence that the starch degraded at a longer timeframe than 

expectable. 

In general, the results showed that it is possible to formulate aluminium-free 

GICs with mechanical behaviour suitable to be used as bone cements in non 

load-bearing sites. The developed GICs presented significant bioactivity giving 

a good indication on their suitability for in vitro and/or in vivo testing. The 

inclusion of starch to the cement formulations imparted degradability in the 

GICs (supported by the occurrence of reducing sugars in the degradation 

enzymatic solution), although, the reduction of the WL when enzymatic medium 

was used requires further evaluation to understand the mechanisms involved in 

the degradation/solubilisation processes. 

The work executed under this thesis resulted in promising perspectives for the 

biological testing of the developed GIC formulations in vitro and/or in vivo. 

Under this perspective it is relevant to project as future work the evaluation of 

their cytotoxicity. Initial in vitro procedure should comprise indirect contact 

method [1-3]. Afterwards, and still under in vitro testing, it is highly relevant to 

evaluate the suitability of the developed bone cements within similar conditions 

than the ones that it will face on its application site. For this purpose, it is 

relevant to evaluate the behavior of osteoblasts (one of the main type of cells 

responsible for osteogenesis) in the presence of cement specimens. 

The outcome of the in vitro biological testing is determinant to define the 

following research steps. In this sense, if positive results are obtained from the 

in vitro testing, it is relevant to initiate in vivo testing; if negative results are 

obtained, the research should come back to the formulation stage with 

optimization of the glass composition or the polymeric part. 

Another section that is opened to optimization is the PAA component. In fact, it 

is known that its high acidity induces pH reduction in the surrounding tissue, 

promoting inflammatory response. Its substitution by different types of polymeric 

acids is a valuable alternative that requires evaluation. Some of these 



CHAPTER IV – General conclusions &amp;amp; Future research 

 

83 

 

alternatives can be polysaccharide-based due to their known biocompatibility 

and in some cases bioactivity. Examples of these polymers are hyaluronic acid 

or carboxymethyl chitosan [4, 5]. 

The analysis of the reducing sugars, present in the degradation solution of the 

starch containing GICs, revealed that starch degradation only starts after the 8th 

week of degradation (within a 12 weeks study). In this perspective it is also 

relevant to test the degradability of the same starch containing GICs at a longer 

time frame. 

Finally, the application of bone cements within the clinical domain requires 

strategies that enable versatility and simplicity of application to the clinician. In 

this perspective, it is relevant to evaluate the suitability of the developed 

formulations as injectable bone cement (one of the most used application 

systems). Under this approach, the optimization of the GIC formulation might be 

required in order to better control their setting time (the time that ranges from 

the start of mixing and the lost of cement moldability) [6-12].
