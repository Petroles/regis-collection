Abstract
Calcium carbonate, a pharmaceutical excipient, is widely used as diluent in solid dosage forms. It is also used as a base for medicinal and 
dental preparations, a buffering and dissolution aid for dispersible tablets, a food additive and a calcium supplement. Egg shells are a rich 
source of mineral salts, mainly calcium carbonate, which corresponds to about 94% of the shell. Layer farms produce large amounts of 
shells, whose final disposal poses a challenge from the environmental standpoint. This work was designed to evaluate the physicochemical 
and thermal properties of calcium carbonate obtained from egg shells. The findings indicated that calcium carbonate from egg shells can be 
used as an alternative pharmaceutical excipient. 
Keywords: thermal analysis; X-ray powder diffraction; egg shells; calcium carbonate.

Resumo
O carbonato de cálcio é um excipiente farmacêutico amplamente utilizado como diluente em formas farmacêuticas sólidas. Também é 
utilizado para auxiliar na dissolução de comprimidos dispersíveis, como base para preparações dentais e medicinais, e como aditivos em 
suplementos alimentares. A casca de ovo é rica em sais minerais, principalmente o carbonato de cálcio que corresponde a 94% da casca. As 
indústrias de ovos produzem grande quantidade de casca e seu destino final é um desafio em termos ambientais. Este trabalho teve como 
objetivo avaliar as propriedades físico-químicas do carbonato de cálcio obtido a partir da casca de ovo. Os resultados demonstraram que o 
carbonato de cálcio obtido pode ser uma alternativa como excipiente farmacêutico.

1 Introduction
Since ancient times fertile eggs, unfertilized eggs and 

chicken embryo eggs have been used by humanity as food and 
also in the treatment of diseases. We must take into account that 
eggs were not created for human being feed, but generating a 
new life, therefore, that is the reason why they are so complete 
and nutritive food4.

The egg shell has the mainly function to protect the chicken 
embryo acting as physical barrier for inhibiting microorganisms 
invasion and it also selects gaseous changes1,9.

According to Thapon and Bourgeois, 1994 shell is ap-
proximately 11% of the total weight of the egg and it presents 
contents of: calcium carbonate (94%), calcium phosphate (1%), 
magnesium carbonate (1%) and organic substances (4%). So, 
egg shell is a rich source of mineral salts, mainly calcium 
carbonate. Unfortunately, egg shell is an eggproduct industry 
residue.

Calcium carbonate, a pharmaceutical excipient, is mainly 
used as diluent in solid dosage forms. It is also used as a base 
for medicinal and dental preparations, buffering and dissolu-
tion aid in dispersible tablets, as well as food additive and 
calcium supplement3,6,14.

Nowadays, there is a great interest in finding new pure 
calcium carbonate sources6. Calcium carbonate obtained from 
bones flour, does not contain the same bioavailability of cal-
cium obtained from synthetic sources. Calcium carbonate from 
oyster shells contains lead vestige among the others potential 
toxical elements such as aluminum, cadmium and mercury15.
In the other hand, egg shell has an advantage for not contain-
ing toxical elements11.

Eggproducts industries produce great amount of shells and 
their final destiny is an environmental impact challenge. This 
work was designed to prepare and evaluate calcium carbon-
ate from egg shell because it has a potencial application in the 
development of a new option of pharmaceutical excipient. The 
lack of information on these subjects suggests that there is a 
promising area to be explored.

In this context, the main objective of this study was to 
investigate the physical-chemical and thermal behaviour of 
calcium carbonate obtained from egg shell comparing to in-
dustrial calcium carbonate.

2 Experimental

2.1 Production of calcium carbonate from egg shell

The chicken egg shell, raw material (Gallus gallus 
domesticus, L.), Hy-line white eggs were obtained from Sohovos 
AB Brasil – Sorocaba – SP – Brazil eggproduct industry. The 
calcium carbonate was produced after it had gone through 
stages of: wash, dry, grind and purification. The details on the 
treatment of the egg shells are suppressed because the Soho-

vos eggproduct industry is in process of intellectual property 
submission request.

2.2 Thermogravimetric analysis

The TG/DTG experiments were measured on Shimadzu 
thermobalance TGA-50. Approximately 6 mg of samples, using 
a platinum pan, were carried out from 25 to 900 °C in dynamic 
nitrogen atmosphere with the flow rate of 50 mL.min–1 and 
heating rate of 10 °C.min–1.

Non-isothermal kinetic study was performed by applica-
tion of Ozawa’s method13. The kinetic study of both calcium 
carbonate, obtained from egg shell and industrial, were evalu-
ated by thermogravimetric curves. The samples were heated 
at different heating rates (2.5, 5, 10, 15 and 20 °C.min–1) to 
target temperature 900 °C under dynamic nitrogen atmosphere 
of 50 mL.min–1. The equipment was preliminarily calibrated 
with standard reference of calcium oxalate.

2.3 X- ray powder diffraction (XRPD)

The XRPD patterns were recorded on an X-ray diffractome-
ter (Siemens model D5000). The samples were irradiated with 
monochromatized Cuk  radiation (1.54056 A°) and analyzed 
between 10-80° (2 theta). The voltage, current and pass time 
used were 40 kw, 40 mA and 1 s, respectively.

2.4 Morphology of particle

Microscopic observation of both calcium carbonates was 
performed under a microscope (Zeiss Axiostar Plus, Japan). 
The samples were mounted on a glass slide, viewed under nor-
mal light and pictures taken with a Zeiss MC80DX camera. 

3 Results and discussion
The thermal analysis method was used, as well as X-ray 

powder diffraction and microscopy. These combining tech-
niques provide quick and proper interpretations, offering the 
thermal stability, molecular organization, particle size and the 
possibility of analytical quantification of substances7,8,12. The 
properties of calcium carbonate obtained of the egg shell was 
compared with the industrial calcium carbonate, purchased 
from LABSYNTH, batch number 71148 USP-FCC.

The thermogravimetric curve TG/DTG obtained for in-
dustrial calcium carbonate (Figure 1a) showed a thermal 
stability up to 600 °C with a small mass loss ( m = 1.8%) 
corresponding to volatile material. The decomposition 
process occurs in a single step in a defined way, between 
temperature range from 601 to 770 °C, with a m = 41.7% 
due to carbon dioxide release, given rise to calcium oxide: 
CaCO

(g) + CaO(s). The calcium carbonate 

usually decomposes at temperatures over 600 °C without fu-
sion process10.

The TG/DTG curve obtained for egg shell calcium carbon-
ate is seen in Figure 1b. The curve showed thermal stability 
up to 630 °C with a mass loss of m = 2.6% referring to 
volatile material. The thermal decomposition process occurs 

at the temperature range from 636 to 795 °C with mass loss 
m = 42.5%, which corresponds to carbon dioxide release, in 

a single step, in a defined way. 

Through the thermogravimetric analysis it is possible to 
evidence that industrial calcium carbonate decomposes at 
temperature about 30 °C less than the calcium carbonate ob-
tained from egg shell, with DTG

peak
 of 749.9 and 771.5 °C for 

industrial and egg shell product, respectively.

Figure 1. The TG/DTG curves measured on Shimadzu thermobalance 
TGA-50. Approximately 6 mg of samples, using a platinum pan, were 
carried out from 25 to 900 °C in dynamic nitrogen atmosphere with the 
flow rate of 50 mL.min–1 and heating rate of 10 °C.min–1, a) Industrial 
calcium carbonate, and b) Egg shell calcium carbonate.

The kinetic data were calculated from plotting the mass 
loss vs. temperature of TG curves obtained to different heating 
rates for both calcium carbonates. Figures 2 and 3, demonstrate 
the superposition of TG curves obtained to industrial and egg 
shell calcium carbonate, respectively. The inserted figure dem-
onstrates the linear tendency of reaction mechanism. 

The activation energy (Ea) and Arrhenius frequency factor 
(Z) were calculated by Ozawa’s method for each five TG curves. 
The activation energy was obtained from a plot of logarithms 
of heating rates (A) as a function of the inverse of temperature 
(1/T) for a constant G(x), in which G(x) is the integrated form 
of the conversion dependence function, f(x). The Ea values 
were 47.83 kcal.mol–1  0.6% and 49.25 kcal.mol–1  0.2% for 
industrial and egg shell calcium carbonate, respectively. It was 
evidenced that the activation energy required for the decom-
position process of egg shell product is higher than industrial, 
which pronounces its largest thermal stability. The Arrhenius 
frequency confirms the stability of egg shell calcium carbonate; 
the obtained results were 3.469 x 109 for industrial calcium 
carbonate and 5.011 x 109 for egg shell calcium carbonate. For 
both products the reaction of degradation was governed by a 
zero order kinetic.

Physicochemical study of CaCO

In order to characterize the crystallinity patterns of in-
dustrial and egg shell calcium carbonate, XRPD analysis was
performed for both samples. The diffractograms in Figure 4
indicate that diffraction patterns of industrial and egg shell

calcium carbonate have similar peaks. The patterns can be put 
upon being the differences only found in the intensity of the
peaks. The sharp peaks of both samples are characteristic of 
the high crystallinity of samples.

Table 1 shows the reflections, d-distances and relative 
intensities (I/I

0
) of the observed peaks in the patterns. The varia-

tion of samples reflections is small being larger in the relative 
intensity. Studies have been considering that the similarity of 
patterns is established if the scattering angles of the strongest 
reflections obtained from an sample agree to about  0.2 de-
grees with that of the reference material; and if the relative 
intensities of these reflections do not vary more than 20%2,5.
The d-distance that considers the distance among the crystal 
plans is similar between carbonates, however, the values of the 

egg shell calcium carbonate is slightly smaller.

4 Conclusions
Through the thermogravimetric analysis it was evidenced 

that industrial calcium carbonate decomposes at a tempera-
ture of about 30 °C less than the calcium carbonate obtained 
from egg shell. The obtained kinetics parameters (Ea) and (Z) 
confirm that egg shell calcium carbonate is more stable com-
paring with the industrial. The XRPD analysis demonstrates 
that both products have similar cristallinity and the microscopy 
indicates that egg shell carbonate has largest particle size. The 
results showed that both products have similar physical chemi-
cal parameters, indicating that egg shell product should be an 
alternative of pharmaceutical excipient. Furthermore, studies 
have been accomplished about the influence of the egg shell 
calcium carbonate in the quality of pharmaceutical products 
like cosmetics.

The morphology of particles was investigated by optical mi-
croscopy for both calcium carbonates. The photomicrographs 
of products are show in Figure 5. The images of industrial 
product (Figure 5a) and egg shell product (Figure 5b) indicate 
that these powders are preferably crystalline, and the size of 
the egg shell product is larger than industrial calcium carbon-
ate crystals. The difference found between the crystals size 
can be related with the thermal stability of egg shell product, 
once the structure and size of crystals are directly correlated 
with the stability.
