resumo  As atividades realizadas em Aquacultura Marinha de Recirculação (RAS) 

levam à constante produção de efluentes, sendo a maior parte 
reutilizados/recirculados ou reciclados depois de submetidos a diferentes 
métodos de tratamento/remediação, ou parcialmente lançadas em  corpos 
de água vizinhos (DWW). Os fosfatos, em particular, são normalmente 
acumulados em altas concentrações em DWW, tanto porque a sua 
monitorização não é obrigatória para a produção de peixe, uma vez que não 
é um parâmetro limitante, e também porque não há nenhum tratamento 
específico até agora desenvolvido para removê-los, em especial no que diz 
respeito a efluentes de água salgada. Como tal, este trabalho aborda duas 
questões científicas principais. Uma delas diz respeito à compreensão dos 
métodos de (bio)remediação aplicados aos efluentes produzidos em RAS 
marinhos, identificando as suas vantagens, desvantagens e lacunas 
relativas à sua exploração nos efluentes de água salgada. A segunda é o 
desenvolvimento de um método novo, inovador e eficiente para o tratamento 
de efluentes de água salgada que potencialmente preenchem as lacunas 
identificadas nos tratamentos convencionais. Desse modo, os objetivos 
desta tese são: (i) rever os tratamentos convencionais aplicados para os 
principais contaminantes nos efluentes RAS marinhos, com especial 
incidência sobre as abordagens de biorremediação já realizados para 
fosfatos; (ii) caracterizar e avaliar o potencial de resíduos de concha de 
ostra colhidos na Ria de Aveiro como um agente de biorremediação de 
fosfatos em água salgada artificial, mediante diferentes fatores (e.g., pré-
tratamento das conchas de ostra por calcinação, tamanho de partícula, 
concentração de adsorvente). Apesar das conchas de ostras já terem sido 
testadas na remoção de fósforo (P) em água doce, o seu potencial de 
biosorção de P em água salgada, tanto quanto eu estou ciente, ainda não 
foi avaliado. Os resultados demonstraram que as conchas naturais (NOS) 
são compostas principalmente por carbonatos, sendo estes praticamente 
convertidos em cal (CaO) após calcinação. Tal pré-tratamento permitiu a 
obtenção de um material mais reativo (COS) para a remoção de P, uma vez 
que se observou maiores percentagens de remoção e capacidade de 
adsorção. Frações de menor tamanho, tanto para NOS e COS, aumentaram 
a remoção de P. Os modelos cinéticos mostraram que NOS ajusta-se, 
simultaneamente, aos modelos de Elovich e de Difusão Intrapartícula, o que 
sugere que a remoção de P é um processo controlado tanto quimicamente 
como pela taxa de difusão. A percentagem de remoção de P em COS não é 
controlada por difusão e o modelo Elovich foi o que melhor se ajustou para a 
remoção de fosfato. Este trabalho demonstrou que os resíduos de conchas 
de ostra, quer NOS ou COS, podem ser usados como biosorventes na 
remoção de fosfato em água salgada. Desse modo, este biomaterial pode 
sustentar uma estratégia de biorremediação económica e amiga do 
ambiente, com potencial para aplicação em RAS de água salgada.

abstract Marine Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) produce great volume of 
wastewater, which may be reutilized/recirculated or reutilized after undergoing 
different treatment/remediation methods, or partly discharged into neighbour 
water-bodies (DWW). Phosphates, in particular, are usually accumulated at 
high concentrations in DWW, both because its monitoring is not compulsory 
for fish production since it is not a limiting parameter, and also because there 
is no specific treatment so far developed to remove them, especially in what 
concerns saltwater effluents.  As such, this work addresses two main scientific 
questions. One of them regards the understanding of the actual 
(bio)remediation methods applied to effluents produced in marine RAS, by  
identifying their advantages, drawbacks and gaps concerning their exploitation 
in saltwater effluents. The second one is the development of a new, innovative 
and efficient method for the treatment of saltwater effluents that potentially 
fulfil the gaps identified in the conventional treatments. Thereby, the aims of 
this thesis are: (i) to revise the conventional treatments targeting major 
contaminants in marine RAS effluents, with a particular focus on the 
bioremediation approaches already conducted for phosphates; (ii) to 
characterize and evaluate the potential of oyster-shell waste collected in Ria 
de Aveiro as a bioremediation agent of phosphates spiked into artificial 
saltwater, over different influencing factors (e.g., oyster-shell pre-treatment 
through calcination, particle size, adsorbent concentration). Despite the use of 
oyster-shells for phosphorous (P) removal has already been applied in 
freshwater, its biosorptive potential for P in saltwater was never evaluated, as 
far as I am aware. The results herein generated showed that NOS is mainly 
composed by carbonates, which are almost completely converted into lime 
(CaO) after calcination (COS). Such pre-treatment allowed obtaining a more 
reactive material for P removal, since higher removal percentages and 
adsorption capacity was observed for COS. Smaller particle size fractions for 
both NOS and COS samples also increased P removal. Kinetic models 
showed that NOS adsorption followed, simultaneously, Elovich and 
Intraparticle Difusion kinetic models, suggesting that P removal is both a 
diffusional and chemically rate-controlled process. The percentage of P 
removal by COS was not controlled by Intraparticle Diffusion and the Elovich 
model was the kinetic model that best fitted phosphate removal. This work 
demonstrated that waste oyster-shells, either NOS or COS, could be used as 
an effective biosorbent for P removal from seawater. Thereby, this biomaterial 
can sustain a cost-effective and eco-friendly bioremediation strategy with 
potential application in marine RAS.

1.1. Aquaculture: definition, production and culture methods  
 

Aquaculture has been defined as the farming of fish and other aquatic organisms by 

applying a flexible and adaptable set of technologies, systems and species (Sugunan et al., 

2007). It can generally be classified as inland aquaculture or mariculture (cf. Figure 1.6). 

Inland aquaculture is usually freshwater-based, but some uses saline water in inland areas, 

i.e. non-coastal areas. Mariculture includes production operations in the sea/offshore, 

intertidal and on-shore zones (FAO, 2014) (Figure 1.1). Some authors, however, consider 

mariculture as every system using saltwater.

Aquaculture production has been rising in Europe in the last years (Figure 1.2). 

Great differences are noticeable between European countries, not only related with the 

production density, but also regarding the consumption of fishery and aquaculture products 

(Figure 1.3). The highest consumption was recorded for Portugal, comparatively to the 

average observed for 28 European Member States (EU-28, cf. Figure 1.3) or to the 

worldwide consumption (18.9 kg/inhabitant/year) (EC, 2014). Overall, farmed products 

represent 24% of the total European fishery consumption (EUMOFA, 2014). In Portugal, 

the main fish species produced are the turbot and sea bream (Figure 1.4), which have been 

a consistent selling product of economic importance (Cassamo, 2012).

The leading aquaculture-producing countries worldwide rely essentially on inland 

aquaculture of finfish (FAO, 2014), though mariculture production has been rising in the 

last years (Figure 1.5). This is because the mariculture-farmed finfish includes more 

valuable species than freshwater aquaculture (FAO, 2014). In the European Union, 

however, the number of marine aquaculture farms is 50,300, whilst inland aquaculture 

occurs only in 11,500 farms (Rana &amp;amp; Choo, 2002).

Aquaculture can be characterized in a number of different ways depending on the 

environment location of the culture (i.e., inland aquaculture versus mariculture), the type 

of production system used, the production intensity and the rearing operation designs 

(Figure 1.6.). Regarding the production system, it can be considered either land- or water-

based systems (EP, 2014). The land-based systems are localized inland and use water 

captures from a different source. These can be categorized as 

- ponds: mostly earthen structures with 0.5-1.5 m of depth, covered by waterproof 

membrane or soil to limit water leakage and a water exchange at &gt; 5-30% per day.  

- tanks: made of polythene, polypropylene, concrete or other materials; can sustain 

water volumes of 1m3 to several hundred m3; usually circular or as long rectangles 

(raceways); with a water exchange of 0.5-4 L/hour.

The water-based systems (Figure 1.7) comprehend either floating or static 

constructions located in a natural water body. They involve:  

- cages: generally based on a secured floating collar with a net bag suspended 

below where the fish is cultured. The mesh size depends on the size of fish. 

Volumes can go from 100 to over 20.000 m3.  

- rafts: floating platforms usually made of wood to support ropes that hang down in 

the water, upon which mussels or other bivalves can be attached.  

- longlines: long horizontal ropes fixed to the shore and each end is supported in 

the water with floats. They also have vertical ropes to support shellfish production 

but are cheaper than rafts. 

- bottom culture: no containment structures, just management practices used for 

mussels, scallops, clams and others. 

- bouchot’: wooden poles with rope twisted around and placed in intertidal areas 

for mussel attachment.  

- trestles: plastic mesh bags or trays containing oysters or other shellfish fixed with 

steel to sands in intertidal zones. 

- lines: suspended between fixed poles and used for seaweed cultivation, or to 

suspend baskets for shellfish.

Aquaculture can also be characterized according to the production intensity, which 

may range from less (extensive) to more intensive production systems (Edwards, 1993; 

Tidwell, 2012): 

- Extensive: no feed added, low stocking density and low water exchange. 

- Semi-intensive: partial feed added, medium stocking density and medium water 

 exchange. 

- Intensive: pelleted feed added, medium to high stocking densities, high water 

exchange, use of mechanical aeration. 

- Hyper-intensive: feed added, very high stocking densities and very high water 

exchange &amp;amp; O2 supplementation. 

 

Most aquaculture plants rely on earthen ponds, operating at a wide range of 

intensities. For examples, the smaller ponds with less than 500 m2, which are extensively 

stocked and fertilized (i.e., extensive and semi-intensive production), can promote the 

stability of small-scale systems for household use and local marketing. Depending on the 

stocking density and the food source, cages may fall within the extensive, semi-intensive 

or intensive categories (Masser, 2012). The highest stocking densities are accomplished in 

hyperintensive systems, which may include cages, but also raceways and recirculating 

aquaculture system (RAS), explained in detailed later.  

The intensity of production is also associated with the rearing operational designs 

that range from open, to semi-closed and closed systems. Open systems rely on natural 

water movement (i.e., tides) to transport waste products away and bring renewed water. 

These aquaculture systems are developed in natural environments (e.g., lake, rivers, 

sea/offshore), namely through the implementation of extensive production conditions. In 

semi-closed systems, the production units are manmade, but still rely on the same level of 

human labour and water flow factors as those of open systems. Here raceways and ponds 

are the major production methods. Closed systems (e.g., RAS), in turn, reuse water and the 

operators control most environmental variables in the system (Tidwell, 2012).  

For certain open systems, the production intensity is a practical indicator of 

potential local environmental impacts. Still other parameters like the conditions of the site 

and management techniques can contribute to reduce the possible environmental negative 

effects of this type of aquaculture systems. However, the production intensity in closed

systems is not necessarily an indicator of its potential environmental impact, e.g., a hyper-

intensive farm using recirculation technology may in part be environmental friendly due to 

its lower exchanges with the neighbouring environment compared to other systems (EC, 

2012). 

 

 

 

1.1.2. Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS)  
!
!

RAS are a land-based fish farming that treat and re-use wastewater from the tank(s) 

where the fish is produced, while simultaneously reducing wastes through several filtration 

stages. Thus, water can be recycled back into the system without needing a great 

percentage of water renewal (Figure 1.8) (Timmons &amp;amp; Ebeling, 2010). In the literature, the 

terms recycling and reuse/recirculation are often misled or used without a clear distinction. 

Recycling is technically a form of reusing, but it refers to the use of wastewater from the 

tanks without undergoing a treatment process. If the wastewater is treated and used again, 

then it is considered a reuse or recirculation system.

Overall, RAS systems have been exploited for the hyper-intensive production of 

many different fish species at any size and life stage. RAS production is generally difficult 

to evaluate since the available statistics are limited. However, European RAS production 

has been increasing considerably both in volume and species diversity (Martins et al., 

2010). In Portugal, it was estimated a production of 10,000,000 fingerlings (fingerling 

heads/year) in 2005 of freshwater and marine species, being the third highest value 

observed for European countries. Additionally, Portuguese RAS grow-out production went 

from 110 to 112 (MT/year) from 2008 to 2009, being turbot, seabass and sole the major 

marine species produced (Martins et al., 2010). 

Comparatively to RAS, the conventional aquaculture systems (e.g., outdoor ponds 

and cages) are not sustainable in the long term run, not only due to environmental 

concerns, but also because of their limitation to assure the safest products to the 

consumers, free from chemicals and metals, freshly raised and local products (Ebeling &amp;amp; 

Timmons, 2012). In fact, RAS offer many advantages over these systems by: 

 

? reducing water (e.g., saltwater RAS with almost no freshwater inputs compared to 

traditional production systems) and land usage (RAS use less than 1% of land than ponds 

and can be explored in areas with poor food production potential, e.g., deserts) (van Rijn, 

2013, Zhang et al., 2013) 

? reducing shipping costs and transport-related fossil-fuel emissions (i.e., CO2) (Martins et 

al. 2010) 

? enhancing fish farming by improving culture conditions, feeding efficiency and stocking 

densities (Ebeling and Timmons, 2012) 

? reducing impacts on marine ecosystems (e.g., diseases, pollutants) through effluent 

treatment, while avoiding concerns related with the exploration of coastal water areas by 

using on-shore tank systems (Goldberg et al., 2001) 

? producing by-products (e.g., N and P contents used as fertilizers) for varied applications 

(e.g., agriculture, cosmetics, feeds, industry) (Klinger &amp;amp; Naylor, 2012). 

 

Notwithstanding, RAS also present disadvantages, despite the availability of 

solutions to overcome them:

17 

? the high cost of feed, labour and operations (Klinger &amp;amp; Naylor, 2012) can be offset by 

the construction of large-scale (&gt;50 MT/year) that would increase labour, processing and 

infrastructures 

? the high start-up costs could be counteracted by increasing stocking densities and 

productions (Martins et al., 2010) 

? the significant energy requirements (Klinger &amp;amp; Naylor, 2012) could be fulfilled by the 

use of "green" energy sources (e.g., solar and wind) 

? the potential accumulation of contaminants, fish mortality and disease outbreak from 

water re-use, and feed efficiency can be surpassed by improving N and P removal [e.g., by 

altering feed inputs, optimizing beneficial bacterial growth (Klinger &amp;amp; Naylor, 2012), cost-

effective bioremediation solutions that could provide value-added products] 

? the tight monitoring of water quality and waste management can be achieved through a 

meticulous design and management of RAS, which involves an efficient feed utilization, 

incorporation of treatment methods of recirculating water or discharged wastewater, as to 

reduce waste production (van Rijn, 2013). 

In spite of these drawbacks, RAS were partially developed to answer the 

increasingly established environmental regulations at the European [e.g., Water 

Framework Directive (EC, 2000); Waste Directive (EC, 2008); Environmental Liability 

Directive (EC, 2004)] and national [e.g., Lei da Água (AR, 2005), law by decree 236/98 

establishing criteria and thresholds for water quality according to its uses (MA, 1998)] 

levels, which dictate land and/or water use, protection and/or management (Martins et al., 

2010).  

 

Under this context, the efficient remediation of wastewater resulting from RAS 

activities is, hence, an extremely relevant aspect. Before going further, it is important to 

clarify the two types of effluents or wastewater normally produced in a RAS system. 

Considering that RAS usually replenish less than 5-20% of its water volume per day 

(Summerfelt &amp;amp; Vinci, 2008; EP, 2014) to account for evaporation, solids removal and 

other losses (USEPA, 2002), it means that most wastewater (RWW – recirculating 

wastewater) from the production tanks is treated and recycled back to the system. The 

remaining wastewater effluents are discharged (DWW – discharged wastewater) after 

being remediated. !

1.2 Objectives and structure of the thesis 
!
!
 This study encloses two main goals. The first one was to revise the available 

literature regarding the remediation methods usually performed to remove or transform the 

contaminants present in marine RAS effluents, also focusing on the bioremediation 

approaches applied to phosphates. The second goal intended to explore the bioremediation 

potential of a biogenic, biodegradable and nontoxic biosorbent based on oyster-shell waste, 

to remove phosphates from artificial seawater. In order to achieve this objective different 

influencing factors were evaluated to select the optimal conditions for P bioremediation: 

shell waste pre-treatment, biosorbent concentration, particle size and equilibration time.  

 The proposed aims were fulfilled along the following sections: 

i) the first section comprised the introduction of the thesis.  

 

ii) in the second section it is presented a revision of the literature on marine RAS and 

(bio)remediation methods applied for reducing the presence of different contaminants 

usually detected in RAS wastewaters, entitled Review: Remediation methods of Effluents of 

Marine Recirculating Aquaculture Systems; 

 

iii) the third section entitled Efficiency of shell wastes for the removal of phosphates from 

artificial seawater – an approach to marine recirculating aquaculture systems presents the 

outcomes obtained in the different experimental trials conducted under laboratory 

conditions. It was prepared in the form of a manuscript to be submitted to a peer-review 

journal; 

 

iv) the last section consists in the Final remarks of the study.

II. Review: Remediation methods of Effluents of Marine 

Recirculating Aquaculture Systems 

____________________________________________________"

 

As most marine Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) are set close to the 

coast, wastewater discharge into the sea or even in neighbour streams is still the most usual 

practice. While in marine RAS with online wastewater treatment such discharge results in 

minor environmental impact, the same does not happen for discharges from RAS with little 

or no wastewater treatment (i.e., recirculation aquaculture operations that do not follow 

environmental regulations). This may cause profound impacts into the receiving 

environment (van Rijn, 2013), particularly if we consider the accumulation of 

contaminants that may still persist after wastewater treatment whenever applied. In this 

regard, water quality control in RAS together with the improvement of available 

remediation measures is a crucial part for a successful, eco-friendly and cost-effective 

operation. Therefore, in the next sections will be highlighted the contaminants usually 

detected in RAS effluents and which methods are usually applied for their reclamation. 

 
!
2.1. Contaminants in RAS effluents  
 

Uneaten feed, excreted metabolites from cultured organisms, pharmaceutical 

residues and water disinfectant agents are common residues in RAS wastewater after each 

culture cycle. As a result, many contaminants enter the system and have been detected in 

saltwater RAS effluents (cf. Table 2.1). Some of them are not considered a threat for the 

aquaculture production and receiving environment (e.g., nutrients, organic matter), unless 

they reach concentrations above the available regulatory levels. Regarding the receiving 

environment, in particular, if high accumulation of contaminants or negative activities 

occur, then direct (e.g., algal blooms triggered by nutrient surplus) or indirect (e.g., pH or 

dissolved organic carbon can affect the toxicity of other compounds in water) impacts are 

likely to take place. More specifically, Goldberg et al. (2001) considered five types of 

potential effects ranging from biological pollution, contaminated fish used in fish feeds, 

organic pollution/eutrophication, chemical pollution to habitat modification.

In order to prevent unbalanced environmental scenarios, marine RAS wastewater 

treatment systems must have into consideration these problems, as to maximize efficiency and 

meet regulatory demands. In this context, the remediation procedures performed in RAS for 

the removal of the main concerning contaminants (cf. Table 2.1) from the RWW and/or DWW 

may target all or part of the following major steps (Tucker &amp;amp; Hargreaves, 2008):  

? solid waste removal,  

? nutrient removal/transformation,  

? bacteria/pathogens sterilization, 

? carbon dioxide removal,  

? dissolved O2 supplementation. 

 

A review on the methods applied for major classes of contaminants in RAS effluents is 

developed along the next sections. For matters of clarity, this is performed separately for 

RWW and DWW.  

 

 

 

2.2. Remediation methods for contaminant removal from RAS effluents 

 

2.2.1 Recirculating wastewater 

a. Solid waste removal 
 

Solid waste consist of colloid and suspended solid particles of different sizes, which 

may include nutrients and organic matter namely derived from fish excretions and feed 

residues, as well as some pathogens or other non-cultured organisms. Solids removal is one of 

the most critical processes in RAS, since they affect the efficiency of all other downstream 

unit processes (Ebeling &amp;amp; Timmons, 2012).  For that, solid particles, are firstly concentrated 

into a sludge, i.e., the concentrated biosolid (Zhang et al., 2013). This may be generally done 

by settling or mechanical filtration, being this latter process performed through, for example, a 



!
!

!
!

24 

microscreen filter. 

The microscreen filters act as a sieve, retaining suspended particles larger than their 

mesh size (Ebeling &amp;amp; Timmons, 2012). They are widely used in large-scale RAS designs as 

the primary means for the removal of solids (Cripps &amp;amp; Bergheim, 2000) and have numerous 

advantages, like easy installation and operation, interchangeable screens and varied mesh sizes 

(usually 60 to 100µm) (Malone, 2013). Despite this, screen filters require high maintenance, 

capital and operation costs (Ebeling &amp;amp; Timmons, 2012). Because of reduced efficiency, they 

create sludge with relatively low concentration of solids (Piedrahita, 2003). Besides, the small-

suspended solids are not efficiently removed and tend to accumulate afterwards (van Rijn, 

1996; Malone, 2013).  

Sludge thickening for settling/capture of large solids in basins or ponds, geotextile 

bags or belt filters and membrane reactors are also applied in RAS. Notwithstanding, 

settling/sedimentation methods are not recommended as the only path for solids removal from 

the RWW in RAS, because they indeed provide low efficiency in retrieving fine solids. 

Moreover, they require more makeup water than screen filters (Piedrahita, 2003). Therefore, 

fine particles (&lt;100 µm) are usually removed by foam fractionation (Timmons &amp;amp; Ebeling, 

2010; Riche et al., 2012; Malone, 2013).  

Foam fractionators (also referred as protein skimmers) (Figure 2.1), which can be 

applied after mechanical filtration or before oxygenation (cf. Figure 1.8), involve the 

adsorption of surfactants in the form of dissolved and fine particles onto bubble surfaces 

(Losordo et al., 1998). As bubbles rise through the tube they collect dissolved materials and 

fine particles from the RWW, because of the chemical properties of both surfactant and air 

bubbles. Briefly, surfactants have a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic end; the hydrophobic end 

goes into the air bubble leaving the hydrophilic end in contact with the water, if this end is 

negatively charged it attracts positively charged materials in the water column, and these 

positively charged materials in turn attract negatively charged particles (Timmons &amp;amp; Ebeling, 

2010). Bubbles attract, therefore, both negative and positive fine and dissolved solids (and 

even bacteria) and when they reach the surface they are removed. It is a simple and 

inexpensive method (Timmons, 1994) that complements the solids removal methods via 

filtration or settling (Tucker &amp;amp; Hargreaves, 2008). Additionally, foam fractionators can be 



!

25 

used for ozone injection, making them both a solid removal and a disinfection device 

(ozonation) all in one unit. They work better in saltwater than in freshwater, because in saline 

water small bubbles are easily formed and foam production is enhanced, since the surface 

tension in seawater is higher than in freshwater (Timmons &amp;amp; Ebeling, 2010). Thus, foam 

fractionators are widely established in marine RAS (Malone, 2013; Timmons &amp;amp; Ebeling, 

2010). Their efficiency is dependent on bubble diameter, the chemical properties of the 

contaminants, the air-to-water ratio and the presence of lipids in the water (which derive from 

fish oils in fish feeds and generally reduce foam formation).

Ozone, besides its germicidal activity, it is highly effective in the oxidation of nitrites 

to nitrates dissolved in water, which results in an improved filtration and removal of colloids 

and suspended matter (Schroeder et al., 2011). For all these reasons, ozone treatments have 

been widely applied (Gonçalves &amp;amp; Gagnon, 2011; Schroeder et al., 2011). However, there are 

several disadvantages to its usage. Besides being an expensive method, this technique may 

lead to the formation of ozone residues that can be lethal to fish even at small concentrations, 

depending on the species and their life stage (Timmons &amp;amp; Ebeling, 2010). An example is the 

formation of biocidal oxidants like bromates [e.g., hypobromous acid (HOBr) and 



!
!

!
!

26 

hypobromite ions (OBr-)] through the reaction of ozone with bromide ions present in saltwater 

(Malone, 2013). These bromates are toxic to fish and shellfish; which makes this technique 

problematic in aquaculture production. Fine suspended material is also removed by biological 

oxidation, which takes place in most RAS within the nitrifying filters discussed later (van 

Rijn, 1996).  

!
!
!
b. Oils/Lipids  
!
 

Despite being hugely overlooked, fish oil from fish feeds is one of the major problems 

to deal in the treatment of RAS effluents, which due to its high organic loading, makes 

disposal of oily wastewater a challenging environmental concern. Portuguese admissible 

values of fat for the discharge of wastewater are 15 mg/L (Table 2.1). However, quantitative 

data on the lipidic content of aquaculture wastewater and its remediation is still deeply 

overlooked.  

The removal of oils/lipids from RWW is usually carried out through a combination of 

physical, chemical and biological approaches (Elleuch et al., 2013). Coagulation–flocculation 

is commonly performed by adding compounds (e.g., ferric chloride) to wastewater as to 

destabilize the colloidal materials and allow the small particles to agglomerate into larger 

settable flocs, and therefore can be employed in the solid waste removal phase. Coagulation–

flocculation process may be used as a pre-treatment, enhancing the biodegradability of the 

compounds before the application of a biological treatment. In what concerns biological 

methods, microorganisms can be applied to degrade oils.  

Lipase is an enzyme produced by different fungi, bacteria and yeast species that can 

transform lipids into glycerol and fatty acids (Bhumibhamon et al., 2002; Azhdarpoor et al., 

2014). The problem is that, fatty acids can inhibit microbial activity because they tend to 

attach to the cellular membrane, making it less permeable and, therefore, preventing their 

further degradation. One reported example is the long chain fatty acids (LCFA) that are 

produced during hydrolysis of triacylglycerol lipids. Oils high in triacylglycerol, such as fish 



!
!

!
!

27 

oil (95-99% of the lipids therein contained; Torstensen &amp;amp; Tocher, 2010), show low 

biodegradation efficiency, because of the LCFA antimicrobial activity (Elleuch et al., 2013) 

which tends to result in the accumulation of LCFA.  

Besides the fact that lipase-producing bacteria are considerably ubiquitous, their use on 

the treatment of oily wastewater can be a quite effective technique if the low permeability 

issue is solved. Therefore, a combination of coagulation–flocculation process with biological 

treatments turns out to be more successful than the use of these processes alone (Elleuch et al., 

2013). But the necessity for two techniques is not ideal, hence new and sustainable alternatives 

should be seek. 

 
 
 

c. Nitrogenous compounds 
!
 

Total ammonia-nitrogen (TAN) is a by-product of fish metabolism and is produced 

during bacterial decomposition of solid organic waste (e.g., fish feeds); it consists of un-

ionized ammonia (NH3) and ionized ammonia (NH4+); posteriorly this ammonia can be 

oxidized to form nitrite-nitrogen (NO2-) and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-) (Losordo et al., 1998). 

NH3 and NO2? are toxic to fish at low quantities (0.1 and  2 mg/L, respectively), but they can 

tolerate fairly high levels of nitrate (&gt;500 mg NO3?/L). However, long-term exposure to 

nitrate can be harmful to some fish (van Bussel et al., 2012). Therefore, these compounds are 

also targeted in RAS RWW treatment. Table 2.2 shows the average removal of N compounds 

in saltwater RAS RWW and DWW after being subjected to different remediation methods.

N compounds and part of the dissolved organic matter are commonly removed by 

biofilters (Yang et al,. 2001). In general, biofilters are compartments that include a 

substrate/medium for microbial attachment and growth, or a section that allows suspended 

microbial growth for aerobic and anaerobic microbial elimination of wastes (Schreier et al., 

2010). The media used in the biofilters must be inert and non-biodegradable (e.g., sand, plastic 

or ceramic materials) (Ebeling &amp;amp; Timmons, 2012). These biofilters perform nitrification and 

denitrification by exposing the wastewater to beneficial bacteria. Nitrification is a two-stage 

process (Figure 2.2).  Firstly, nitrifying bacteria (e.g., Nitrosomonas sp. and Nitrosococcus sp.) 

oxidize ammonia to nitrite. Secondly,  Nitrospira sp. oxidizes nitrite to nitrate (Gutierrez-

Wing &amp;amp; Malone, 2006; Schreier et al., 2010). Many systems rely on a variety of different 

microorganisms to accomplish denitrification, i.e., the conversion of nitrate into nitrogen gas 

(N2) under anaerobiosis (Schreier et al., 2010; Chavez-Crooker &amp;amp; Obreque-Contreras, 2010; 

van Rijn et al., 2006).

There are several types of biofilters frequently used in saltwater RAS. Two of them 

are: the microbead biofilters and the moving bed bioreactors (Figure 2.2). Microbead biofilters 

have been long used mainly because of their simplicity, low cost and negligible ecological 

footprint. They operate with small plastic beads that float in the system, which gives a high 

specific surface area of contact, what favours microorganism-contaminant contact. For these 

reasons, this type of biofilter is usually preferred to other designs. Its main detriment is the 

inherently dependence on supplementary addition of O2 to the water flow (i.e., they do not 

have a O2 pumping system incorporated) to maintain aerobic conditions for the 

microorganisms in the biofilm. Therefore, under low influent dissolved O2, anaerobic

conditions will be generated within the biofilter, leading to inadequate nutrient removal due to 

microbial loss (Ebeling &amp;amp; Timmons, 2012).  

More recently, moving bed bioreactors have been introduced and are already the most 

competitive of all the biofilter designs (Ebeling &amp;amp; Timmons, 2012). The media is in 

suspension and is mechanically aerated, which provides effective mixing of microorganisms 

with the effluent (Ebeling &amp;amp; Timmons, 2012), thus contributing to RWW aeration and 

degasification later required. The main advantage of this system is the already integrated O2 

addition system, and the simultaneous provision of carbon dioxide stripping. However, this 

technique provides low specific surface area and the application of a substrate with higher 

surface area requires more expensive filters. In contrast, microbead biofilters, like previously 

said, use substrates with high specific surface area, hence triggering lower costs and space 

requirements (Ebeling &amp;amp; Timmons, 2012). 

Notwithstanding, the biofiltersapplied to treat saline effluents, as oppose to freshwater, 

may not be effective to remove N compounds because of the inhibitory effect of salinity on 

nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria (cf. Yang et al., 1995, Sakairi et al., 1996, Glass and 

Silverstein, 1999, Sánchez et al., 2004) and sometimes concentrations in the effluents surpass 

admissible values (Table 2.1). 

A good performance of a marine RAS is strongly dependent on biofiltration efficiency. 

Because of the salinity levels, biofilters still are not completely adequate in removing N 

compounds from saltwater RWW. Data regarding microbial ecology of these 

nitrification/denitrification reactors in RAS is still limited and the microbial community in 

biofilters is difficult to control, which becomes the main cause of the limitations in the 

biofiltration phase (Martins et al., 2010).

d. Phosphorus 
!

Besides N, the excess of phosphorus (P) also greatly contributes for the eutrophication 

of aquatic systems. The removal of P is a serious concern that has not yet been sufficiently 

solved (Vohla et al., 2011) (Table 2.3).  

!
Table 2.3. Average concentration (mg/L) of phosphate (PO4

3--P) before and after different remediation 

techniques in saltwater RAS. 

 
nd - not determined. 

 

Phosphorous has been removed from RWW by biofilters and retention ponds 

techniques. Sharrer et al. (2007) using a membrane biological reactor obtained a total 

phosphorus removal of 96.1% in freshwater, but with increasing salinities this rate was 

reduced until it reached 65.2% at 32 of salinity of TP. Hussenot et al. (1998) using a retention 

lagoon removed 25-52% of phosphates and acknowledge it as a low efficient removal method 

for orthophosphates. 

The efficiency and cost effectiveness of phosphate removal is one of the difficulties in 

RAS and quite overlooked, despite some authors obtained acceptable removal after RWW 

treatment (Table 2.3). However, some still don’t reach admissible concentration for discharge 

(Table 2.1). Phosphate is usually neglected for RWW, which could lead to accumulation In 

DWW. Yet, RAS do not have a specific phosphate removal system in freshwater and saltwater 

RAS.

d. Pathogens  
 

To kill bacterial, viral, fungal and protozoan pathogens, UV light and ozone gas 

(Figures 2.3) are usually employed before water re-enters the system (Schroeder et al., 2011; 

Gonçalves &amp;amp; Gagnon, 2011). Foam fractionators, besides removing fine solids, can also 

sterilize the effluent, alone or coupled with UV and ozone treatment. 

UV lights emit wavelengths that are deadly to microorganisms and the disinfection 

rates are normally proportional to the light intensity. If properly sized, UV radiation is 

effective. However, the light penetration in the water requires that RAS effluents are not very 

turbid as to assure effectiveness. Furthermore, UV light bulbs have to be routinely replaced 

every few months (Malone, 2013). The second method mainly used for disinfection is ozone 

gas. Ozone is a very powerful oxidant rapidly absorbed by most recirculating waters. Ozone 

destroys the remaining dissolved organic matter, bacteria, viruses and protozoan organisms. 

The main advantages and downsides of ozone treatment have already been previously 

mentioned in solids waste removal. Although the combined use of ozone and UV treatments is 

particularly effective in pathogen removal (Martins et al., 2010), it becomes expensive and 

quite demanding in operational terms.

2.2.2 Discharged wastewater  
 

 RAS effluents that are not recycled back into the recirculation loop (i.e., DWW) may 

be directed to a wastewater treatment plant or, alternatively, be discharged into a receiving 

water body, after being (or not) subjected to some treatment methods (Tucker &amp;amp; Hargreaves, 

2008). The main difference between the remediation procedures for DWW and RWW in RAS 

is that the latter requires fast acting techniques that guarantee an efficient aquaculture 

production and safe products. Therefore, more time-consuming (and sometimes cheaper) 

methods can usually be applied to remediate DWW. At the end, the aim is to achieve good 

quality emission levels as established in national legislation (e.g., Lay by decree 236/98) in 

what concerns nutrients (phosphate, nitrates), dissolved organic matter, biological/biochemical 

oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total suspended solids.  

A common preliminary treatment approach for both RWW and DWW concerns the 

removal of suspended solids, which is often made in sedimentation basins (USEPA, 2002b). 

Settling basins are simple and of low maintenance, and many of the contaminants of concern 

in RAS can be partly removed with the captured solids, such as P and N compounds and 

disinfectants. However, these basins require large areas and regular cleaning of accumulated 

solids (Timmons &amp;amp; Ebeling, 2010). Besides, they present reduced efficiency in removing 

small-sized particles without chemical addition (USEPA, 2002b). Whenever the levels of 

nutrients like phosphates and nitrates are not in compliance with the regulated levels, further 

treatment of DWW can be developed in hydroponics (Gorder, 2001) and/or constructed 

wetlands (USEPA, 2002a) (cf. following section). Aquaponics (i.e., combination of RAS with 

hydroponics; Klinger &amp;amp; Naylor, 2012) and constructed wetlands are still mainly applied in 

freshwater aquaculture effluent treatment (Webb et al., 2012), being their application in 

saltwater quite disregarded. Aquaponics could still be used in the treatment of effluents from 

RAS mariculture, as far as a commercially valuable halophytic plants, micro- or macroalgae, 

capable of growing in saline wastewater, are employed (Webb et al., 2012). Such approach 

would benefit from the continuous nutrient-rich discharges from RAS culture tanks (USEPA, 

2002a, Klinger &amp;amp; Naylor, 2012), while helping reducing nutrient concentrations towards the 

safe release of DWW in receiving waters. 



!

!
!

34 

Another approach to reduce the contaminant burden in RAS DWW is based on 

constructed wetlands. These are man-made or engineered ponds that treat wastewater through 

physical, chemical and biological processes (USEPA, 2002a). Overall, they are a relatively 

simple and low cost technology that uses the ecological interactions of aquatic plants, detritus, 

microbes and fauna from wetland ecosystems to capture and transform contaminants (e.g., 

nutrients) from wastewaters (Lymbery et al., 2006; Sim et al., 2008). As a result, constructed 

wetlands have been already implemented for the treatment of different types of effluents (e.g., 

municipal or domestic sewage, industrial and agricultural wastewater) (Webb et al., 2012), but 

they offer potential for the remediation of saltwater RAS effluents if halotolerant organisms 

are used (e.g., halophytes; Webb et al., 2012). In marine RAS there are only a few studies on 

operations integrating constructed wetlands and its saline effluent treatment (Lymbery et al., 

2006; Webb et al., 2012; Jesus et al., 2014). However, Jesus et al. (2014) using a simulated 

constructed wetland reported nutrient removal efficiencies from the DWW in compliance with 

Portuguese regulations. 

Large-scale RAS could economically benefit from their own waste treatment facility, 

such as a Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) (Gorder, 2001). This procedure has several steps 

(Figure 2.4), where both solid and dissolved wastes (e.g., nitrates and phosphates) are treated 

in a single container. In the aerobic phase, carbon oxidation and nitrification are accomplished, 

and in the anaerobic phase denitrification occurs (Fontenot et al., 2007). SBR allows the 

treatment of RAS wastewater for posterior discharge into adjacent waterways.

2.3. Digging into the “bio” of phosphate remediation in RAS effluents  
!
 

 

Phosphate is one of the contaminants that is not yet satisfactorily, cost-effectively, 

environmental-friendly and efficiently removed/transformed with the currently applied 

remediation methods (Martins et al., 2010), because high concentrations can be detected in 

DWW, which may cause impact in the marine environments. Besides, it has not been pointed 

out as a strong limiting factor in fish production, what conversely does not push towards the 

development of new and efficient (bio)remediation measures. Notwithstanding, the levels of 

phosphorus usually surpass the regulated levels in RAS DWW (Trepanier et al., 2002; Martins 

et al., 2009a; Martins et al., 2010). In a closed aquaculture system, it has been shown that 

phosphate can be accumulated in concentrations as high as 19.5 mg P/L (Martins et al., 

2009a), and after effluent treatment P concentrations were not always below the admissible 

values for discharge (Table 2.1). Thereby, the release of P-enriched effluents into adjacent 

coastal areas may ultimately trigger the development of eutrophication scenarios, which are 

quite harmful for aquatic life (Trepanier et al., 2002). Also, focusing the remediation of RAS 

DWW only on the reduction of N compounds is not enough to preclude those scenarios 

(Schindler et al., 2008).  

Novel and promising approaches for eco-friendly wastewater treatment in saltwater 

RAS are greatly welcomed, and they could involve bioremediation strategies using live 

organisms and/or biological materials produced by them. Overall, bioremediation refers to the 

application of biological systems, metabolites or materials to destroy, transform and/or 

immobilize organic and inorganic contaminants (Gadd, 2010).  

 

!
2.3.1. Live organisms 
!
!

The metabolic activities of live organisms can be exploited in bioremediation strategies 

(Fomina &amp;amp; Gadd, 2014) that may bear on, for example, biosorption, 



!
!

!
!

36 

transformation/degradation, immobilization and bioprecipitation mechanisms, towards 

contaminants removal. Different live organisms may be exploited for this purpose, but in 

marine RAS, however, there is a limiting aspect since only halotolerant or halophilic 

organisms can be applied.  

As such, plants, micro- and macroalgae have been the most used live organisms in 

saltwater RAS for the uptake of P surplus (i.e., assimilatory reaction). Notwithstanding, the 

exploitation of these phototrophic organisms (e.g., Brown et al., 1999; Lymbery et al., 2006; 

Webb et al., 2012) is usually performed under an integrated scheme of production, named as 

Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) systems. In an IMTA, the waste nutrients from 

the higher trophic-level species (e.g., fish) are used for the production of organisms belonging 

to a lower trophic-level (e.g., plants). In general, the RAS-IMTA combination can not only 

increase the system productivity through the removal and concentration of solids from the 

recirculating flow, but also reduce the waste outputs in a cost-effective and environmental-

friendly manner, while producing value-added biomass for different end-uses (Martins et al., 

2010; EC, 2012). IMTA usually requires specific infrastructures, such as wetlands, algal ponds 

and aquaponic systems (previously described), in which the phototrophic organisms 

bioremediate RAS wastewater. !
Webb et al. (2012), using wetland filter beds with the salt-marsh halophyte Salicornia 

europaea, could remove 67±14% of dissolved inorganic phosphate over 58 days from 

wastewater of a marine fish and shrimp farm. However, with a much lower retention time 

(0.76 day), Lin et al. (2003) accomplished only 5.4% PO43--P reduction. Waller et al. (2015) 

used three halophyte plant species (Tripolium pannonicu, Plantago coronopus and Salicornia 

dolichostachya) in hydroponics incorporated in a marine RAS and could retain 7 g of P, which 

was equivalent to 10 % of the P introduced by the fish feed.  

Studies on RAS using macroalgae-based systems for wastewater bioremediation are 

still limited (Schuenhoff et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2007; Mao et al., 2009; He et al., 2014) and 

usually focuses on N compounds (Corey et al., 2014; Robledo et al., 2014). Promising results, 

however, were reported by He et al. (2014), which obtained 77.1% of PO43-P removal using 

the red seaweed Gracilariopsis longissima. Hussenot et al. (1998) observed 47% of PO43--P 

removal using microalgae (diatoms). The use of diatoms is not yet fully studied for treating 



!

37 

high effluent flow rates, but it shows promising P removal efficiencies and application in 

farms operating as closed systems (Hussenot et al., 1998; Lefebvre, S., 2000). Nevertheless, 

Borges et al. (2005) using three classes of microalgae (Prymnesiophyta, Bacillariophyta and 

Prasinophyta) were able to achieve PO43--P removal percentages between 97.2 and 99.4% 

from an effluent of a marine RAS at the laboratory scale. A microalgae pond alternative was 

more recently introduced by Babatsouli et al. (2015), which used a novel immobilized/packed 

bed bioreactor with a microalgae Picochlorum sp. inoculum to remove 56-95% phosphates. 

Despite the high P removal efficiencies that can be achieved with microalgae, the up-scaling 

of such systems requires additional costs, e.g., to prevent disturbing natural populations but 

also, conversely, manage their influence on the bioremediating species, plus the establishment 

of an economically attractive use for the resulting biomass. 

 

 

2.3.2. Biological materials 
!
!

Biological materials are the components presented or produced by a living organism 

(e.g., polymers; cellulose; chitin; ceramic composites, such as shells) (Meyers et al., 2008). 

They can be exploited as bioremediation agents for contaminant, both combined with methods 

using living organisms or even solely.  

The mechanism most often mediating the bioremediation of contaminants by 

biomaterials regards biosorption. Biosorption is a promising cost-effective clean-up method 

(Fomina &amp;amp; Gadd, 2014) that does not generate toxic by-products, is economic and rather 

simple in terms of design and operation (Vakili et al., 2014). It involves the uptake of 

contaminants from aqueous solutions by the biosorbent through metabolism-independent 

mechanisms (e.g., physical and chemical adsorption, electrostatic interaction, ion exchange, 

complexation, chelation) (Aksu, 2005). A chemical adsorbent requires periodic replacement 

and recycling, which typically involves high costs and waste production. An alternative 

adsorbent should be cost-effective, easily available, environmental-friendly, without thorough 

pre-processing, easily recycled and effective to meet increasingly stringent environmental 



!

!
!

38 

quality standards (No &amp;amp; Meyers, 2000). Furthermore, the recycling of wastes as natural 

biosorbents is a strategy lately welcomed and studied. Among them, agricultural biowastes 

from eucalyptus bark, peanut shells, walnut shells, peach stones, grape seeds and olive waste, 

have been reported as potential biosorbents with application in fish farms for drug residues 

(Ferreira et al., 2015). Nevertheless, these biowastes can per se enhance phosphate loads in 

wastewater. Shell wastes, however, present better characteristics for P bioremediation in RAS 

DWW.   

Bivalve-shell wastes are discarded by-products during seafood production and 

processing industries in many coastal countries (Liu et al., 2009; Ismail &amp;amp; Aris, 2013). Due to 

its disposable problems, bivalve-shell wastes make a cheap, available, re-usable, 

biodegradable and desirable adsorbent for marine RAS wastewater treatment studies. In 

addition, the recycle concept and regeneration of this biosorbent can also be applied, providing 

a treatment method with high efficiency potential, also representing a low cost bioremediation 

agent. 

Bivalve shells consist of one or more ceramic phases (e.g., calcite, aragonite) mainly 

composed by carbonates (Liu et al., 2009; Nakamura et al., 2014). The use of carbonate shells 

as a biosorbent has been getting attention due to their ability to control water quality through 

the sorption and precipitation of contaminants (Ismail &amp;amp; Aris, 2013). They have been applied 

as media for biological filters (Liu et al., 2010), in oyster-shell-bedded subsurface constructed 

wetlands (Yam et al, 2013); as an adsorbent of metals (Blais et al., 2003; Hsu, 2009; Liu et al., 

2009; Ismail &amp;amp; Aris, 2013; Alidoust et al., 2015) and P compounds (Kwon et al., 2004; Lee et 

al., 2005; Seo et al., 2005; Namasivayam et al., 2005; Currie et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2009; 

Abeynaike et al., 2011; Vohla et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2013). However, all 

these applications were directed to freshwater effluents not associated with RAS.  

The use of bivalve-shells does not have side effects and is not harmful to the 

environment and humans comparatively to chemical additives usually applied in traditional 

methods of contaminants removal (Ismail &amp;amp; Aris, 2013). Notwithstanding, because they have 

the ability to adsorb several metals from wastewaters, deliberation is necessary when choosing 

the means of disposal/application of the bioadsorbent after effluent treatment to avoid 

secondary contamination. 



!

39 

Adsorption of nutrients or other contaminants in aquaculture effluents by these type of 

shells has not been explored especially regarding marine RAS, despite their excellent chemical 

properties (Hayes et al, 2008b). As such, additional research is required to study their full 

bioremediation potential (Hayes et al., 2008a; Hayes et al., 2008b).

III. Efficiency of shell wastes for the removal of phosphates from 

artificial seawater – an approach to Marine Recirculating Aquaculture 

Systems 

_________________________________________ 
 

3.1. Introduction 
!
 

Recirculating Marine Aquaculture Systems (RAS), including total and semi-

recirculating/partial-reuse systems, are increasingly becoming more attractive to modern 

aquaculture (EU, 2014), having the highest production per area and per worker comparatively 

to any other aquaculture system (Timmons &amp;amp; Ebeling, 2010; Tidwell, 2012). Besides, its 

characteristic feature of water reuse/recycling through waste and energy management allows, 

in turn, the conservation of energy (to heat water) and make-up water, disease and pollution 

control, nutrient recycling and environmentally sustainable production of fresher, safer, and 

locally raised seafood (Martins et al, 2010; Timmons &amp;amp; Ebeling, 2010; Tidwell, 2012). 

In the literature there is little distinction between saltwater and freshwater, but 

generally RAS can replenish 5-20% of its water volume per day (Summerfelt &amp;amp; Vinci, 2008; 

Burut-Archanai et al., 2013). However, the release of wastewater into adjacent water bodies is 

likely to occur. This is particularly worrying because some RAS do not have effective (if 

implemented) discharge wastewater (DWW) treatments, what may represent considerable 

threats for wildlife, local environmental resources and human activities (e.g., bathing, fishing, 

irrigation water) (Grigorakis &amp;amp; Rigos, 2011). In fact, certain contaminants have been 

quantified in RAS DWW, resulting from fish wastes and unconsumed feed, therapeutics and 

tanks clean-up, such as, suspended solids, pharmaceutical residues, dissolved organic matter 

and nutrients (P and N compounds) (Piedrahita, 2003). Although part of them seems 

innocuous, high amounts of organic matter and nutrients have a key-role in promoting the 

occurrence of, for example, algal blooms that may lead to eutrophication scenarios in valuable 

neighbour aquatic systems (Barak et al., 2003). In this context, phosphorus (P) is a major 



!

54 

contributor for such scenarios, which is often neglected in the recirculation water, but must 

comply with national (AR, 2005; MA, 1998) and/or European (EC, 2000; EC, 2008; EC, 

2004) regulated levels to allow RAS wastewater discharge (Tal et al., 2009; Martins et al., 

2010).  

In closed aquaculture systems, P can be accumulated up to 20 mg P L-1 (Trepanier et 

al., 2002; Martins et al., 2009). Nevertheless, there is a lack of specific phosphorous-removal 

systems in RAS (Martins et al. 2009). Traditional methods of P-removal applied to RAS 

DWW are usually based on its precipitation in sedimentation basins (Piedrahita, 2003; 

Timmons &amp;amp; Ebeling, 2010). Recently, the use of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture may 

help removing it by phototrophic organisms (e.g., plants and micro-/macroalgae), which are 

produced as a value-added product (Chaitanawisuti et al, 2011; Webb et al., 2012). 

Additionally, the innovative use of biological treatments, as opposed to the chemical processes 

is being favoured (Barak et al., 2003; Burut-Archanai et al., 2013). 

The development of simple and cost-effective bio-based techniques may include the 

use of biosorbents, i.e., the use of live or dead organisms, their components, and/or 

biosynthesized materials to remove substances from solution through different physical and 

chemical processes (e.g., adsorption, ion exchange, complexation, chelation). Such 

biotechnological approach has been rendering a promising alternative to bioremediate 

different contaminants with a considerable efficiency (Gadd, 2009), namely P, using chitosan 

(Chung, 2006) and several agricultural wastes, such as soybean residue “okara” (Nguyen et 

al., 2015), pine bark (Karachaliosab &amp;amp; Wazne, 2014), carbon residue that results from wood 

gasification (Kilpimaaa et al., 2014), palm surface fibers (Ismail, 2012); coir pith (Krishnan &amp;amp; 

Haridas, 2008); sugarcane bagasse (Zhang et al., 2012) and giant reed (Xu et al., 2011). 

Biogenic calcium-based materials are also considered to be one promising sorbent for P-

removal, because they can form stable and insoluble forms with phosphate (Vohla et al., 

2011). In particular, oyster-shells are primarily composed of calcium carbonate 

(approximately 96%) (Yoon et al., 2003), what enables its use for similar applications. In 

many countries, the increasing production and consumption of oysters is contributing to the 

accumulation of oyster-shells in coastal areas as a waste product, both from mariculture or 

food processing industries (Kwon et al., 2004; Namasivayam et al., 2005; Park &amp;amp; Polprasert, 



!
!

!
!

55 

2008). Thereby, the recycling of oyster-shell waste in alternative applications is of great 

relevance. Under this context, oyster-shell waste has already been reused as construction 

material (Li et al., 2015; Yoon et al., 2003), fertilizer and chicken feed (Kwon et al., 2004). 

But it has also significantly contributed to the removal of phosphates (e.g., Kwon et al., 2004; 

Lee et al., 2005; Namasivayam et al., 2005; Currie et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2009; Chen et al., 

2012), metals (e.g., Blais et al., 2003; Hsu, 2009; Alidoust et al., 2015) and other contaminants 

(e.g., Asaoka et al., 2009; Melegari &amp;amp; Matias, 2012) from freshwater. Notwithstanding, the 

exploitation of this waste product for P-removal from saltwater effluents resulting from RAS 

culture tanks is deeply overlooked.   

  Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to analyse the efficiency of oyster-shell 

waste as a biosorbent for the removal of phosphates from marine RAS DWW. For that, 

different factors were evaluated in order to obtain optimal P removal efficiencies in saline 

wastewater, namely, oyster-shell pre-treatment, particle size, contact time, biosorbent 

concentration, and initial concentration of phosphate. 

 

 

3.2. Materials and Methods 
 

3.2.1. Processing, pre-treatment and characterization of oyster-shells  
 

Oyster-shells wastes of the species Crassostrea gigas were collected in Ria de Aveiro, 

Aveiro, Portugal. Sediment and other debris were washed out from the shells, which were then 

dried at 60ºC. The dried shells were crushed prior to sieving (sieve shaker CISA® mod. 

RP.08) through five sieves of 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 and&amp;lt;0.125 mm, resulting in the fractions F1, 

F0.5, F0.25, F0.125 and F&lt;0.125, respectively. These fractions were then subjected to 

different pre-treatments, which involved their calcination under an air or argon atmosphere at 

900°C for 3 hours. The aim of using calcinated oyster-shells in this study was to get a material 

with enhanced reactivity for P removal by the decomposition of carbonates into CaO, together 

with the increase of the specific surface area and lowering of the particle size under high 



!

56 

temperatures (Abeynaike et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2013; Alidoust et al., 2015). That way, three 

conditions were tested relatively to oyster-shell pre-treatment: i) natural oyster-shell (NOS) 

not calcined, ii) calcined oyster-shell (COS) under air atmosphere, iii) calcined oyster-shell 

under argon atmosphere (AOS). The fractions were stored in a desiccator and prior to each 

adsorption experiment they were placed overnight in the oven at 70°C. 

 

3.2.2. Experimental setup 
 

In order to test the efficiency of oyster-shell fractions as a biosorbent for P-removal in 

artificial saltwater, several assays were sequentially made targeting the influence of specific 

parameters or factors. The goal was to select the optimal experimental settings for P-removal, 

and progressively reduce the amount of testing conditions within each parameter in the 

subsequent experiments. As such, the first factor concerned the oyster-shell pre-treatment, 

which was tested by considering the conditions outlined in the previous section, i.e., NOS, 

COS and AOS for the granulometric fraction of 0.125 mm (i.e., F0.125), during 30 minutes at 

an initial P concentration ([P]i) of 12 mg L-1 and an adsorbent concentration of 1 g L-1. 

Secondly, the effect of particle size and equilibration time was evaluated for all granulometric 

fractions of NOS and COS up to 120 minutes exposure time, under the same [P]i , though the 

mass loading of the adsorbent was of 50 g L-1 for NOS and 1 g L-1 for COS . Thirdly, for 

testing the effect of the adsorbent dosages, the COS granulometric fraction F1 at 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 

0.25 and 5 g L-1 was studied during 15 minutes exposure and [P]i of 12 mg L-1. Finally, the 

effect of [P]i was analysed for the NOS fraction F&lt;0.125 (50 g L-1) and COS fraction F0.5 (1 g 

L-1) during 8 hours and 30 minutes, respectively, under  0.05, 0.5, 1.5, 3 and 6 mg P-PO43- L-1.  

All assays were carried out at room temperature (20±4ºC), using a synthetic salwater 

phosphate solution prepared by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) (ACS 

reagent, Sigma) in marine artificial water (Tropic Marin® PRO-REEF sea salt) with a salinity 

of 24. Each set of test conditions containing the powdered shells was conducted in triplicate, 

and the two controls (artificial marine water with crushed oyster-shells subjected to the 

respective pre-treatment, and phosphate solution without the crushed oyster-shells) in

duplicate. The assays were performed with continuous agitation at 112 rpm on an end-over-

end shaker (Heidolph Overhead Shakers Reax 2; Heidolph Instruments GmbH &amp;amp; Co. KG, 

Germany). After agitation, the samples were filtered (Whatman® glass microfiber filters, 

Grade GF/A, Sigma) being immediately measured the pH and orthophosphate concentration 

(i.e., P concentration measured as orthophosphate, cf. section 3.2.3. below) in the filtered 

solution.  

 

 

3.2.3. Analytical methods 
 

The characterization of the oyster-shells was conducted through the application of 

different methods. This characterization was carried out for the oyster-shell fractions 

(regarding the pre-treatment and particle size) providing the most efficient P removals 

according to the outcome of the different experimental trials. 

The natural crushed oyster shells were subjected to thermogravimetric and differential 

thermal analysis under air atmosphere in the equipment LabsysTM TG-DSC16. The X-ray 

diffraction (XRD) patterns of NOS (F&lt;0.125) and COS (F0.5), before and after P removal 

assays, were obtained in the XRD instrument Rigaku Geigerflex, operating at 40 KV/30mA 

and equipped with a Cu target. The chemical elements (Ca, Mg, Si, Al, Fe, K, P) in the 

composition of oyster-shells fractions before (NOS-F&lt;0.125 and COS-F0.5) and after P 

removal experiments were measured in a Thermo X-Series quadrupole ICP-MS (Inductively 

Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry; Thermo Scientific) equipped with Ni cones and a 

Burgener nebulizer, refrigerated with a Peltier system made in a credited laboratory. The 

CHN-S (organic carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulfur) analysis was performed in NOS 

(F&lt;0.125) and COS (F0.5) fractions under a combustion temperature of 1075ºC followed by a 

burner temperature of 850ºC in a Truspec 630-200-200 CNH-S analyzer.  

P concentration was measured as orthophosphate (P-PO43-) by the ascorbic acid method 

(APHA, 1999) and detection limit was calculated (c.f. Supplementary Information). 

Absorbance readings were performed using Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer (Hitachi 

Instruments, Inc., Danbury, CT) set at 889 nm.

3.2.4. Data analysis 
 

a. Removal equations 
!

The sorption capacity (q) and the removal percentage (R) of P by the biosorbent 

fractions were calculated using the following equations: 

 

! = (!0!!)! !  (mg g
-1)    (1) 

! = (!0!!)!0 ×!100  (%)    (2) 
 

where C0 represents the initial concentration of P in the solution (mg L-1), C is the P 

concentration in the solution after equilibration with oyster shell (mg L-1), V the volume of the 

P solution added (0.010 L), and m (g) is the mass of the oyster shell. When equilibrium is 

attained, the concentration in solution and the sorption capacity will be designated Ceq and qe, 

respectively. 

 

 

b. Kinetic models 
 

Four models were used to describe P-removal kinetics: the Pseudo-First-Order (PFO) 

or Lagergren kinetic model; the Pseudo-Second-Order (PSO) model; the Elovich equation and 

the Intraparticle Diffusion model.  

 

The Pseudo First-Order model (PFO) 

 

The Lagergren’s equation (Equation 3) was the first kinetic equation presented to 

describe the adsorption in solid–liquid systems. It is applied when the rate of occupation of 

binding sites in the sorbent material is proportional to the number of unoccupied sites (Ho, 

2004a).  



!
!

!

59 

 

!t = !e!(1 ? !e!!1!)    (3) 
 

where, qe and qt are the sorption capacities at equilibrium and at time t, respectively (mg g-1) 

and k1 is the rate constant of pseudo-first order sorption (h-1).  

 

 

The Pseudo Second-Order model (PSO) 

 

The pseudo-second-order kinetic model (Ho, 2006) is represented in the integrated 

form as shown in Equation 4. 

 

!t = !!
!!!!!

!!!!!!!
!    (4) 

 

where k2 is the rate constant of pseudo second-order adsorption (g mg-1 min-1).  

 

 

The Elovich equation 

 

The Elovich equation assumes that the reacting solid surfaces, such as oyster-shells, 

are energetically heterogeneous. The two previous kinetic equations are reaction models. The 

Elovich equation can be derived from either a diffusion-controlled or a reaction-controlled 

process (Zhang &amp;amp; Stanforth , 2005). The difference between them lays in the limiting step of 

the adsorption process, which for a diffusion model is the diffusion behaviour into the particle 

pores; but the rate-determining step in Elovich equation can be either diffusional or chemical. 

Elovich equation (Chen et al., 2012) is shown as: 

 

!t = !"!!!×!!!!! +
!
!!
+ ln!   (5) 

 



!
!

!
!

60 

where ae is the initial adsorption rate (mg g-1 min-1) and, be is related to the distribution of 

activation energies and the extent of surface cover (Zhang &amp;amp; Stanforth , 2005; Cerofolini et 

al., 1996). 

 

 

The Intraparticle Diffusion model 

 

The Intraparticle model is a diffusion kinetic model. The intraparticle diffusion model 

(Weber &amp;amp; Morris, 1965) is originated from Fick’s second law and is expressed as: 

 

!t! = !i!!!/! + !   (6) 
 

where ki is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant (mg(g h)-1/2) that can be obtained from the 

slope of the plot qt vs. t1/2 and C (mg g-1) is a constant indicative of external mass transfer as 

being significant in the sorption, thereby acting as the rate-controlling step. When the line q 

versus t does not pass by the origin (C?0) that means that intraparticle diffusion is not the only 

rate limiting mechanism 

  

 

c. Adsorption isotherms 
 

Langmuir (Equation 7) and Freundlich (Equation 8) adsorption isotherms were applied 

to the experimental equilibrium adsorption data. The Langmuir isotherm model assumes an 

entirely homogeneous surface, where sorption has the same activation energy. On the other 

hand, the Freundlich isotherm model fits highly heterogeneous surfaces (Chen, 2013). 

 

!e = !"L!eq1+!L!eq    (7) 

!e = !F!!!"!     (8) 



!
!

!
!

61 

Where the Langmuir constants Q (mg g-1) and kL (mg g-1) are the maximum adsorption 

capacity at the temperature of the isotherm and the adsorption equilibrium constant, 

respectively, while the Freundlich constants kF (mg g-1) and N have a less defined physical 

meaning and are usually related, in case of kF to the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and 

N is related to energy and intensity of adsorption.  

 

d. Statistics and software  
 

Non-linear regression analysis, for fitting models to experimental data, was made using 

the program GraphPadPrism6® (Trial version; http://www.graphpad.com; last accessed on 

10th June 2015).  

Variance analysis (ANOVA) and pairwise multiple comparisons of means were 

performed using IBM SPSS software package, version 20. The level of significance 0.05 was 

used. 

 

 

 

3.3. Results and Discussion 
 

3.3.1. Chemical characterization of the crushed oyster shells 
 

Since different pre-treatments based on the calcination of raw oyster shells were 

evaluated, the primary analysis of the material regarded its thermogravimetric behaviour 

(Figure 3.1). The TGA/DTA analysis allows testing the influence of temperature and heating 

air atmosphere on the physical and chemical properties of the biomaterial. The decomposition 

pattern obtained for NOS indicated that its calcination initiated at 710ºC, being completed at 

863°C (Figure 3.1). The correspondent weight loss under air atmosphere was of 42%, which 

was due to the conversion of CaCO3 at 863ºC following the reaction CaCO3?CaO+CO2. 

Other studies obtained slightly lower onset and peak temperatures, which were approximately 



!
!

!
!

62 

645-650ºC and 780-900ºC, respectively (Kown et al., 2004; Choi et al., 2011). The DTA 

profile evidenced an exothermic change with a peak at 849ºC, immediately followed by an 

endothermic reaction.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 3.1 – Thermogravimetric (TGA) (expressed as % weight loss) and differential thermal (DTA) 

analyses of natural oyster-shell (fraction F0.5) under air atmosphere 

 

The XRD profile of NOS showed that calcite (CaCO3) was the major crystal phase, 

though quartz (SiO2) was also detected (Figure 3.2). This outcome is in line with other studies 

(e.g., Kown et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2010; Alidoust et al., 2015) despite that SiO2 was reported 

only by some authors (e.g., Yu et al., 2010). The resemblance of our results with those of the 

literature is not surprising, considering that natural oyster shells are originally from similar 

environments and present analogous characteristics (Yoon et al., 2003). The calcination of 

crushed oyster-shell provoked deep changes in the chemical and crystal characteristics of the 

raw material (Figure 3.2).

Seemingly, and as previously suggested by the TGA, the carbonates in NOS were 

almost totally converted at 900ºC, resulting in a calcinated material (COS) essentially 

constituted by lime (CaO) and a lower amount of CaCO3 (Figure 3.2). Other studies obtained 

similar decomposition of oyster shells calcined under air atmosphere at 750ºC (Kown et al., 

2004; Yu et al., 2010) and 900ºC (Alidoust et al., 2015). 

The elemental composition of NOS and COS determined by ICP-MS evidenced that 

Ca is highly represented in NOS and, mainly, in COS (Table 3.1). Except for Fe and Si, the 

other trace elements were also measured at higher concentrations in COS. Asaoka et al. (2009) 

reported lower concentrations of Fe, K and Mg (0.009, 0.02, 0.94 mg g-1, respectively), but 

higher Ca content (404 mg g-1) in crushed oyster-shell powder, determined by ICP-AES.

NOS – non-calcinated oyster-shell (fraction F&lt;0.125); COS – calcinated oyster-shell under air atmosphere 
(fraction F0.5); P – phosphorous. P-removal experiments run with NOS at 50 g L-1 for 60 minutes, and with COS 
at 1 g L-1 for 5 minutes, both under an initial concentration of 12 mg P L-1 

 

 

Table 3.2 shows the results obtained by CHN-S analysis of NOS and COS fractions. In 

NOS was measured ca. 11% of organic carbon, 0.13% of hydrogen and 0.10% of nitrogen. 

Silva et al. (2010) achieved similar results in raw oyster shells from different sites for nitrogen 

(0.15 – 0.23%) and carbon (11.94 – 12.09%), being hydrogen and sulphur absent. From these 

elements, only a small amount of carbon was measured in COS. The nitrogen detected in NOS 

indicated the existence of amino groups in the organic fraction, derived from proteins 

responsible for the CaCO3 biomineralization in shells (Silva et al., 2010). The absence of

3.3.2. The effect of pre-treatment 
!
 

Phosphate removal efficiency in saltwater was compared in NOS and in the two pre-

treatments consisting of calcination under air atmosphere (COS) and argon (AOS) (Figure 

3.3). Calcination of oyster shells under air or under an inert gas (e.g., argon or nitrogen) may 

provide different results. Pyrolysis under an inert gas atmosphere leads to increased mass loss 

relatively to air calcination, which in turn means further thermal decomposition of the material 

and higher reactive surface area (Know et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2009). For this reason, the 

efficiency of COS and AOS was evaluated in this first trial. 

Preliminary assays using high and low adsorbent concentrations demonstrated that 1 g 

L-1 was sufficient to accomplish almost complete P-removal in pre-treated oyster-shells (cf. 

Figure 3.4). Similar conclusions were made regarding the exposure time, which for COS it 

appeared that the equilibrium occurred approximately after 30 minutes. For comparison 

purposes the same parameters were applied for NOS.

Figure 3.3. Comparison of removal percentage (R), adsorption capacity (q) and phosphate 

concentration in saltwater solution (C) for argon-calcined (AOS), air-atmosphere calcined (COS) and 

natural oyster-shells not subjected to calcination (NOS). Experimental conditions: samples fraction 

F0.125, 30 minutes exposure, initial P concentration of 12 mg L-1 saltwater, adsorbent concentration of 

1 g L-1. 

 

  

NOS displayed a removal efficiency of 9.3±2.3%, an adsorption capacity (q) of 

1.1±0.3 mg g-1 and a P concentration (C) of 10.8±0.3 mg P L-1. In COS, 97.5±0.6% of P was 

removed with a C after 30 minutes of 0.25±0.10 mg P L-1 and a q of 11.6±0.1 mg g-1. For 

AOS, the concentration of phosphate was below the detection limit (cf. section 2.5. of  

Supplementary Information); which corresponds to ?98.1% of P-removal, a ?0.22 mg P L-1 of 

C and q of ?11.8 mg g-1. The solution pH was 7.8, 9.5 and 10.2 in NOS, COS and AOS, 

respectively. 

Kown et al. (2004) achieved a consistent trend with ours, since the P removal they 

obtained from standard solutions (not in saltwater) was greater for pyrolised oyster-shells (at 

650-800ºC) under nitrogen atmosphere (up to 98%) comparatively to air-calcined (at 750ºC; 

ca. 68%) and raw (&lt;10%) oyster shells (5g L-1 adsorbent, 30 mg P L-1 and 30 minutes 

exposure). In another study, Lee et al. (2009) used oyster shells pyrolyzed under nitrogen 

atmosphere at 750ºC and attained 98% phosphate removal (0.6 g adsorbent L-1, initial 



!
!

!
!

67 

concentration of 11.9 mg P L-1 and 30 minutes exposure). 

As such, the removal efficiency of AOS is somewhat similar to COS. Not only that, the 

pH in AOS treatment appears to be even higher than in COS after remediation, which is not 

desirable when considering the discharge of saltwater wastewater into the environment (Vohla 

et al., 2011). Additionally, calcination with argon atmosphere showed to be an expensive and 

less efficient pre-treatment method, regarding both the equipment and energy required, and the 

extremely low amount of sample that can be processed in each pyrolysis cycle. For these 

reasons, this pre-treatment abandoned and the upcoming assays only used NOS and COS.  

 

 

 

3.3.3. The effect of size particle and equilibration time on P-removal 
!
 

NOS and COS were evaluated for their capacity to remove phosphate from saltwater 

(Figure 3.4). Among the five granulometric fractions, the smallest (F&lt;0.125) shows the 

highest phosphate removal in both NOS (56.3±0.5%) and COS (? 98.1%) after 120 minutes, 

giving rise to a decrease of P concentration in solution from the initial value of 12 mg L-1to 

5.30±0.06 mg L-1 for NOS and values lower than the limit of detection (?0.22 mg L-1) for 

COS. This corresponds to adsorption capacities of 0.137±0.001 and ? 11.8 mg g-1, 

respectively. Particle size effect was very evident; as the particle size decreased, the phosphate 

uptake capacity (q) increased with the best phosphate removals achieved with the smallest 

granulometric fractions, which is in consensus with previous works (Lee et al, 2005; Lee et al, 

2009; Park  &amp;amp; Polprasert, 2008a; Chen et al., 2012) and it may be explained by the fact that 

surface area increases as the particle size decreases. As expected due to previous studies 

(Abeynaike et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2005; Kwon et al. 2004; Vohla et al., 2011; Currie et al., 

2007), CaO from COS appears to be more efficient in removing phosphate from water than 

CaCO3 from NOS (Figure 3.4). Besides Namasivayam et al. (2005) who reported that NOS did 

not remove any phosphates, other studies (Kwon et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2005; Currie et al., 

2007; Abeynaike et al., 2011), like ours, also accomplished P-removal using raw oyster or 



!
!

!
!

68 

mussel shells (NOS). Namasivayam et al. (2005) do not specify whether the NOS were 

crushed, which could explain the result disparity, since surface area is an important parameter 

for adsorption. For COS, the sorption of P was very rapid - attaining very high values in the 

early seconds - regardless of the different particle sizes suggesting that precipitation may be a 

key removal mechanism (Lee et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2013). This occurred faster than 

reported by other authors (Kwon et al., 2004; Currie et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2005) where more 

than 90% removal percentage occurred between 5-30 minutes, but some of those authors did 

not use contact times as short as ours. After the very rapid initial removal, adsorption capacity 

in COS continued to increase, although at a slower, but still high rate (notice the variation of x 

scale in the graphics of Figure 3.4 for COS). Equilibrium occurs after 15 minutes for F&lt;0.125 

and 30 minutes for the other fractions.  In NOS, equilibrium appears not to be reached after 2 

hours (Figure 3.4a). After a rapid initial increase, the adsorption capacity continues to increase 

at much slower rate. This much slower increase suggests the existence of abundant pores, 

which allows water and P penetration within the adsorbent, thus adding to the adsorption 

capacity (Kwon et al., 2004). However, because the rate of increase is very slow, removal at 

120 minutes can be considered at pseudo-equilibrium (Hojati &amp;amp; Khademi, 2013; Owabor et 

al., 2010).  

Table 3.3 compares the some removal percentages obtained by other authors for 

solutions of phosphate in distilled water, with the removal percentage obtained in the present 

work using artificial seawater. The percentage removal obtained in the present work is in 

accordance with previous studies, suggesting that ionic strength and salinity do not adversely 

influence the P-removal onto oyster-shells.  

The removal percentage in NOS obtained by Currie et al. (2007) was somewhat similar 

to the present study despite a lower concentration of oyster shell powder and exposure time, 

which are factors that should contribute to a lower percentage removal (cf. sections 3.3.4 and 

3.3.6). This may be explained by the smaller granulometric fraction (0.038-0.075 mm) applied 

by Currie et al (2007), since P-removal increases when fraction size decreases. On the other 

hand, Kwon et al. (2004), using the same parameters as Currie et al. (2007), reported only 

15% of P-removal, but without specifying the granulometric fraction used. Lower removal 

percentages are also reported by Chen et al. (2012), who used fractions similar to

the present study, with sizes of 180 - 250 µm (~ F0.125) and 250-425 µm (~ F0.25), and 

obtained 11 and 9% removal even though longer exposure time and slightly lower [P]i 

were employed. The lower removal percentages obtained by Chen et al. (2012) relatively 

to Currie et al (2007) may be attributed to the difference of granulometry of the 

adsorbent, while the much lower percentage removal relatively to our results may be 

attributed to the higher adsorbent concentration used in the present work. However, Chen 

et al (2012), even with the smallest fraction, obtained a P-removal of 16%, which is 

significantly lower than the one achieved by Kwon et al. (2004) using similar adsorbent 

load.  

In what concerns COS, and analogously to the results obtained in this work, Lee 

et al. (2009) using similar parameters and fractions sizes, such as 0.36-0.6 mm (~ F0.25) 

and 0.6-1 mm (~ F0.5), accomplished &gt;99% P-removal. Additionally, similarly to this 

study total P-removal in COS was achieved somewhat fast for all fractions. The results 

obtained by Lee et al (2009) and also in the present work, suggest that a much smaller 

adsorbent concentration should be effective. However, studies by Kwon et al. (2004) and 

Currie et al. (2007), despite the similar assay conditions among them reported 68% and 

90% of P-removal, respectively. Once again there is no mention of granulometric size by 

the first. The absence of relevant information in the literature limits the discussion and 

comparison of the results. 

Figures 3.4c and 3.4f show the variation of pH along time. The initial phosphate 

solution of 12 mg P L-1 has a pH 7.3. In Figure 3.4c and 3.4f, t=0 corresponds to the 

solution pH immediately after contact with the adsorbent. pH in NOS initially increases 

fast, reaching a pH 7.5-7.9 and continuing to increase at a slower rate until pH 7.8-7.9. The 

same happens in COS, where almost immediately a pH 9-10 is attained followed by small 

variations that moreover keep the pH at 9.7-10. Higher pH in COS denotes a high 

concentration of HO- due to the dissolution of CaO (Equation 9) versus a low concentration 

of HO- in NOS from dissolution of CaCO3 (Equation 10), additionally confirming that CaO 

has been formed in COS (cf. XRD Figure 3.2). These results are comparable to those 

obtained by Abeynaike et al., (2011) who reported final pH ranges of 11.4-12.6 in 

pyrolysed mussel shells and 7.7-7.9 in NOS; and by Lee et al., (2005) who found pH&gt;11 

for pyrolysed shells and pH 8.5 for NOS. With increasing pH, the phosphates in the water

(or orthophosphates) may be present in different forms (Equation 11). Consequently, in the 

case of exposure to COS, these different orthophosphate ions can react with the Ca2+ and 

OH- ions (Equations 9), thereby forming a variety of calcium phosphates. However, the 

insoluble precipitate hydroxyapatite (Equation 12) is the most thermodynamically stable 

form of calcium phosphate (Nancollas et al., 1978). In order to hydroxyapatite precipitate 

the solution needs a pH above 10 (Abeynaike et al., 20011). High pH favours a sufficient 

supply not only of OH- ions but also of PO43- ions (Equation 11). In COS, this condition 

was apparently reached in F1 after 60 minutes, in F0.5 after 10 minutes and in F0.25, 

F0.125 and F&lt;0.125 after only 3 minutes of exposure (3.4.f). Abeynaike et al. (2011) 

reported that this precipitation could be homogenous, where phosphate precipitates in 

solution, or heterogeneous, by precipitating on the surface of the adsorbent.

In the case of phosphorus removal by COS, the mechanism of phosphate removal may 

involve homogeneous precipitation. Lee et al (2009) demonstrated that the precipitation of 

phosphate with pyrolysed oyster shells (750ºC, 1h, under N2) occurs homogeneously and with 

no adsorption of phosphate. However, heterogeneous precipitation of phosphate at the surface 

of the adsorbent has also been proposed as a removal mechanism (Abeynaike et al, 2011).  

Some authors (Currie et al, 2007; Abeynaike et al, 2011) have shown that, during pyrolysis of 

oyster shell powder at 750 and 800ºC, CaCO3 can be only partially converted into CaO, giving 

rise to particles which, due to a shrinking core mechanism in the pyrolysis, will have an outer 



!
!

!
!

73 

surface of CaO and an inner unreacted calcite core. Abeynaike et al. (2011) have also shown 

that, for smaller particles, more CaCO3 is transformed into CaO, leaving a smaller core of 

CaCO3. CaO dissolves and homogeneous or heterogeneous precipitation can occur. According 

to Abeynaike et al. (2011), heterogeneous precipitation of hydroxyapatite onto CaCO3 is much 

faster than homogeneous precipitation. Besides, when the pyrolysis does not achieve full 

conversion to CaO, there is the potential of a dual mechanism where the phosphate could both 

adsorb and precipitate. According to the characterization of COS presented in section 3.3.1, 

the conversion of CaCO3 into CaO was complete and precipitation must be the removal 

mechanism by COS. ! 
Although Abeynaike et al. (2011) refers that phosphate can be removed by 

precipitation or sorption onto oyster-shells, the potential sorption mechanism of phosphates by 

the oyster shells is the least understood. However, because CaCO3 is more insoluble compared 

to CaO it is expected that the key phosphate-removal mechanism for natural oyster-shells 

(NOS) is the absorption and/or adsorption (Abeynaike et al., 2011). 

 

 

 

3.3.3.1. Kinetics of phosphorus removal  
 
 

The four models presented in section 3.2.4.b were used to describe P-removal kinetics. 

The equations of the models were fitted to the average values of the three replicates of the 

adsorption data shown in Figure 3.4. For removal by NOS, different ways of data input for 

analysis were evaluated, namely, the use of all exposure times studied or shorter exposure 

times with a higher contribution of the fast initial removal of phosphate (c.f. Figure 3.4). For 

COS, as the equilibrium is attained very fast, the kinetic equations were fitted to the data 

corresponding the time interval 0-30 min. Tables 3.4 and 3.5 show the parameters of the 

models fitted to the data for NOS and COS, respectively. The goodness of fitting is evaluated 

by the determination coefficient R2.

a. Kinetics of phosphorus removal by NOS 
!

 

The PFO model did not represent the kinetics of phosphorus sorption as well 

as the other models for NOS. A higher value of R2 (0.9898) was reported by 

Namasivayam et al (2005) who concluded that phosphate adsorption onto NOS was 

well expressed by this model, but the authors did not compare with other models. The 

same conclusion was made by Asaoka et al., (2009), regarding hydrogen sulphide 

adsorption (R2= 0.94 - 0.993). Other studies reported that the PSO model is the best 

model for adsorption kinetics of phosphate onto NOS (Chen et al., 2012), when 

compared to Elovich and Intraparticle Diffusion models, indicating that 

chemisorption may play a significant role in the adsorption process of phosphate onto 

NOS. In the present work, this model did not fit the data so well, mainly for the 

smallest fractions. However, the sorption capacity (qe) predicted by the model agrees 

very well with the experimental data and rises when granulometic fraction size 

decreases; but PSO rate constant, k2, seems not to follow any pattern among fractions, 

reaching its maximum with F1 (2,363 g mg-1 min-1).  

The Elovich model appears to be one of the best-fit models for NOS (Figure 

3.5), with better R2 values, higher than 0.94, for short time intervals, corresponding to 

the faster initial increase of adsorption.  

The Intraparticle Diffusion model seems to be also a very good fit for NOS 

(Figure 3.5), particularly when using data from 0 – 120 min, recording R2 values 

between 0,9066 and 0,9971 (Table 3.4b). Moreover, ki, the intra-particle diffusion rate 

constant, decreases as the fraction size increases, probably due to the existence of less 

accessible pores in the interior of the adsorbent particles. As can be seen in Figure 

3.5, the line of the Intraparticle Diffusion model does not pass through the origin, 

suggesting that Intraparticle Diffusion is not the only rate limiting mechanism and a 

faster adsorption occurs for short contact times.

Figure 3.5. Plots of the Elovich model and Intraparticle Diffusion model for NOS analysed 

with average values from 0 to 120 min and from 0 to 75 minutes.  

 

Thus, the kinetics of sorption onto NOS is better modelled by the Elovich and 

the Intraparticle Diffusion models, with the former fitting better the data for shorter 

time intervals and the latter fitting better the data for a larger time interval. This 

suggests that more than one kinetic mechanism plays a role in the phosphate 

adsorption process onto NOS and that the removal is both a diffusional and 

chemically rate-controlled process, with a fast initial chemical sorption at accessible 

sites at the surface, probably with some heterogeneity of binding energies, as assumed 

by the Elovich model, and a sorption into the pores occurring mainly during the slow 

increase of sorption for longer exposure times, which rate is at least partially 

controlled by the diffusion rate. .

b. Kinetics of phosphorus removal by COS 
 

In the case of homologous precipitation, the kinetic models usually used to 

describe adsorption at a solid surface may be not adequate.  

Analysing the results of Table 3.5 for the fitting of the several models, it is 

clear that the PFO and PSO models are inappropriate to fit the kinetics of P-removal 

by COS, giving rise to abnormal values for R2 when granulometric fraction size 

decreases. These models only fitted reasonably well to the data for F1.  

 The Elovich model is the kinetic model that best fits phosphate removal by 

COS (Figure 3.6), with R2 values between 0.906 and 0.956 (Table 3.5) for all size 

fractions with the exception of F&lt;0.125. As previously concluded, removal efficiency 

increases with the decrease in granulometric size (Figure 3.4) and alongside, the 

smaller the fraction, the faster the P-removal occurs meaning that equilibrium may be 

achieved in COS F&lt;0.125 too fast for the model curve to adjust properly. Besides, for 

those very short times, the uncertainty is higher due variations in contact time, since 

the time needed to filter the samples is not very much lower than the time during 

which the suspensions of COS in phosphate solution were shaken.   

 

 

a.  b.  

Figure 3.6. Plots of the PSO (a) and Elovich (b) models for COS 

In what concerns the Intraparticle Diffusion model, R2 values from Table 3.5 

indicate that this model does not fit the data for COS.  This is coherent with the 

calcination process that was applied, which increases the pore size of the sample 

(Alidoust et al., 2015), allowing easier penetration of the adsorbate and making 

diffusion not a rate-controlled removal process.

3.3.4. The effect of P concentration on its removal 
 

 

The P-removal ability of oyster-shells was evaluated for different initial 

concentrations of P, using an adsorbent density of 1g L-1 for COS and 50 g L-1 for 

NOS (Figure 3.7).   

 

 

 

 
Figure 3.7. Removal percentage in NOS and COS over time for initial concentrations of 0.5, 

1.5, 3 and 6 mg P L-1. Experimental conditions: adsorbent concentrations of 1g L-1 for COS 

(F0.5) and 50 g L-1 for NOS (F&lt;0.125) with exporure times of 30 and 480 minutes, 

respectively. 

 

 

For COS, the equilibrium is reached very fast (within 5-10 minutes) and P 

concentrations after attaining the equilibrium were below the detection limit, which 

corresponded to a P removal of ?92%, ?97.3%, ?98.6% and ?99.3%, for 0.5, 1.5, 3 

and 6 mg P L-1, respectively. These results are in agreement with precipitation 

(homogeneous and/or heterogeneous) as the removal mechanism and also with the 

removal percentage obtained for an initial concentration of 12 mg L-1 (cf. section 

3.3.3). Thus, for the concentrations from 0.5 to 12 mg P L-1, which are within the 

range usually found in RAS DWW, the removal percentage of phosphorus with 1 g L-

1 of COS is higher than 92%. 

For NOS after 8 hours, P-removal is 80.0±1.5%, 83.7±0.1%, 77.8±4.3% and 

70.7±0.5% for 0.5, 1.5, 3 and 6 mg P L-1, respectively. Comparison of the mean

values by one way ANOVA, followed by Tukey test for pairwise comparison, showed 

that the percentage removals of P for the first three concentrations are not 

significantly different, but the removal for 6 mg P L-1 is lower than for the other 

concentrations. This behaviour suggests that, at this concentration, the depletion of 

binding sites reduces the extent of adsorption, which is characteristic of Langmuir 

isotherm model. Since adsorption appears to be the mechanism responsible for 

phosphate removal in NOS, adsorption isotherm models were adjusted to NOS data 

only. 

 

 

3.3.5. Adsorption isotherms 
 

Using the data of qe and Ceq after 8h of equilibration from experiments 

described in the previous section, the variation of the equilibrium adsorption capacity 

of NOS versus equilibrium concentration of phosphorus was obtained. Langmuir 

(Equation 7) and Freundlich (Equation 8) adsorption isotherms were fitted to the 

experimental equilibrium adsorption data. The experimental data and the curves fitted 

to de data for NOS are shown in Figure 3.8.  

 

 
Figure 3.8. Adsorption isotherms of phosphate in NOS. The same conditions as “The effect of 

initial P concentration” with the exposure time of 8h were used.

81 

Regarding the fitting of isotherm equations, it is still very common to find in 

the literature a variety of adsorption studies that use the linearized forms of the 

isotherms and all adsorption studies discussed here that use oyster-shells applied 

linearization (Namasivayam et al., 2005; Seo et al., 2005; Hsu et al., 2009; Asaoka et 

al., 2009; Melegari &amp;amp; Matias, 2012; Chen et al., 2013; Alidoust et al., 2015). 

However, several studies have already reported the problems associated with the 

isotherm equation linearization methods and suggested that isotherm data should be 

adjusted to Freundlich and Langmuir original equations by non-linear regression 

analysis, which gives the better values for the isotherm parameters (Filipe, 2012). As 

referred by Ho (2004b), "the conversion of non-linear isotherm equations to linear 

forms implicitly alters their error structure and may also violate the error variance 

and normality assumptions of least squares method". That being said, adsorption 

isotherms were fitted in their non-linear form for the first time in oyster-shells. 

Equations 7 and 8 were fitted to the average data of three replicates. 

The Langmuir and Freundlich calculated constants are shown in Table 3.6.  

 

Table 3.6. Equilibrium isotherm model parameters for Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm 

models applied to NOS. The same conditions as “The effect of initial P concentration” with 

the exposure time of 8h were used. 

 

 

For NOS, a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.996 indicates that the 

removal process is better fitted by the Langmuir model, suggesting a monolayer 

adsorption. However an R2 of 0.990 for Freunlich model also shows a good 

adjustability (Table 3.6). According to the Langmuir model, the maximum adsorption 

capacity (Q) of NOS is 0.144 mg g-1. This is approximately the value obtained for the 

experiments with an initial P concentration of 12 mg L-1 as described in section 3.3.3. 

Thus, with a NOS concentration of 50 g L-1, the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent 

is exhausted for a [P]i of 12 mg L-1.  In Freundlich model the value of N was lower 

than 1, revealing that adsorption was not a favourable process (Hsu et al., 2009; Chen

82 

et al., 2013). Additionally, the low value of kF  (0.0577 mg g-1) in Freundlich model 

suggests a low affinity of NOS to phosphate (Melegari &amp;amp; Matias, 2012). These results 

agree with the study from Seo et al, (2005), that also reported a good fit of Langmuirs 

model in P-adsorption onto NOS. Different results were reported by Namasivayam et 

al., (2005), that concluded that phosphate adsorption onto NOS obeys the Freundlich 

isotherm (with constants, kF = 19.47 and N = 1.02), However, the authors obtained a 

lower R2 (R2 = 0.87) and did not test other isotherm models. Asaoka et al., (2009), on 

the other hand, when studying hydrogen sulphide adsorption in NOS also reported a 

better-fit model using Langmuir isotherm.  

 

 
 

3.3.6. The effect of adsorbent concentration on P-removal 
!
 

Using oyster-shells in excess can possibly lead to an expensive consumption 

of both material and energy. For that reason, in this part of the experimental setup was 

evaluated the optimal adsorbent concentration for P removal from saltwater. At the 

light of the above experimental trials, it was made clear that COS-F0.5 provided 

optimal P removal percentages, by also taking into consideration pH variations in the 

final solution. The experiments were performed with an initial P concentration of 12 

mg L-1, for 15 minutes. Figure 3.9 depicts the removal and capacity of P adsorption 

along varying COS concentrations, as well as the measured pH changes.

COS concentrations of 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 5.00 g L-1 achieved in 15 

minutes a P-removal of 41.5±23.8%, 82±22%, 86.8±10.8%, ?98.1% and ?98.1%, 

respectively. This suggests that more than enough adsorbent is present for P-removal 

and a COS concentration of 0.75 g L-1 is sufficient to acquire high P-removal. On the 

other hand, the maximum solution pH reached was measured at 0.75 g adsorbent L-1 

(10), being lower at 0.10 g adsorbent L-1 (8.8) (Figure 3.9b).  

According to Equation 12, for hydroxyapatite precipitation, 6 moles of PO43- 

require 10 moles of Ca2+ and a pH&gt;10. Therefore, for complete hydroxyapatite 

formation, the concentration of adsorbent needs to be in excess. According to the 

TGA analysis (Figure 3.1), the adsorbent is composed by 99% CaO. Based on the 

lowest concentration used (1 g L-1), Ca2+ concentration in solution is 1.8 mmol L?1, 

which is 3 times superior to the minimum Ca2+ required (0.65 mmol L?1) for complete 

hydroxyapatite precipitation. However, Figure 3.9a only shows high removal for 

concentrations of 0.75 and 5 g L-1. Therefore the limiting factor for hydroxyapatite 

precipitation in 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 g L-1 is the pH, since all the adsorbent concentrations 

applied had enough Ca2+ in solution. However, XDR analysis of the shells after P-

removal did not show peaks characteristic of hydroxyapatite, suggesting that it can be 

present in an amorphous phase or other calcium phosphate is being formed, as 

demonstrated in the next section.  

 

 

 

3.3.7. Biosorbent characterization after P removal assays  
 

The P removal experiments by oyster-shell samples (i.e., NOS and COS) in a 

salinity of 24 in artificial saltwater led to the XRD profiles showed in Figure 3.10. 

The XRD pattern of the NOS fraction showed the presence of calcite, quartz, halite 

(NaCl) and wustite (FeO). For COS, however, the only difference in comparison to 

the original material (cf. Figure 3.2) was the formation of halite when exposed to 

saltwater spiked with phosphate.

The detection of NaCl in both fractions and FeO in NOS is associated with the 

use of saltwater in the experiments. Saltwater presents NaCl and Fe compounds, 

which might precipitate and crystallize during the slow drying of the samples.

85 

However, no crystalline P-based compounds could be detected. Instead of this, Yu et 

al. (2010) suggested the precipitation of a calcium phosphate [Ca5(OH)(PO4)3] 

through the reaction of calcium silicate with phosphates in a freshwater phosphate 

effluent, under P-removal experiments conducted with COS (calcination at 800ºC for 

1h). In an attempt to find out the amount of P associated with the adsorbents, an ICP-

MS analysis was carried out.  

The measured concentrations of P in NOS+P and COS+P fractions (Table 3.1) 

were coherent with the adsorption capacity (q) of each biosorbent material (cf. Figure 

3.4), for the same experimental conditions. Hence, it strengthens the P biosorption 

potential of oyster shell wastes, particularly by COS. Besides, this analysis showed 

that although P did not form crystalline precipitates as observed by Yu et al. (2010), it 

rests associated with the bioadsorbent. 

 

3.4. Conclusions 
 

The present study has demonstrated that waste oyster-shells can be used as an 

effective reagent for phosphate removal in seawater. Specifically, it was shown that 

calcination as a pre-treatment, effectively increases P-removal ability of oyster-shells, 

though it can promote the raise of pH in saltwater. For an initial concentration of 12 

mg P L-1, the removal percentages for NOS-F&lt;0.125 and COS-F0.5 were, respectively 

56.3% and 98.1% after 120 minutes exposure. However, the smaller the 

granulometric fraction, the higher the P-removal, independently of being NOS or 

COS.  Adsorption was the main mechanism suggested for P removal by NOS, whilst 

for COS, was suggested to be is a co-mechanism of precipitation may occur. NOS 

adsorption isotherm was consistent with Langmuir model and followed, 

simultaneously, Elovich and Intraparticle Difusion kinetic models. COS followed 

only chemically rate-controlled kinetic models, namely, Pseudo Second-Order and 

Elovich models. Overall, optimal conditions for P removal from saltwater could be 

established for NOS and COS, which may allow comply with regulated P levels for 

the discharge of wastewater in saltwater RAS. Moreover, both biosorbents enclose 

many other valuable characteristics for their promising biotechnological application, 

namely the recycling of waste material, the low production cost relatively to the 

amounts required and the eco-friendly exploitation.

PRO-REEF sea salt with a salinity of 24 – that has a pH ~ 8, we evaluated possible 

salinity influences in the spectrophotometric quantification using samples made with 

AMW. A calibration curve was prepared as usual. From a stock solution of 1 mg P L-1 

made with DW, several standards are prepared in volumetric flasks where the final 

volume is filled also with DW. This calibration curve is the one used for comparison 

(R² = 0,99993.). A new P stock solution was prepared, this time with AMW, and two 

types of solutions  (with the same concentrations of the standards in DW) were made 

by dilution the stock solution in AMW: 1) diluting with DW and 2) diluting with 

AMW The concentration of the P in these two types of solutions was calculated using 

the DW calibration curve The calculated value for the concentration was coincident 

with the expected value, with differences bellow 5%. Salinity therefore does not 

interfere with P quantification. Since no significant difference exist when dilution of a 

sample with AMW is made with DW, assay samples were always diluted with DW 

for P quantification. 

 Detection limit concentration of the method was calculated using the residual 

standard error such as the following equation. 

 
where sy/x  is the residual standard error and b is the slope of the curve. Without 

dilution, detection limit concentration is 8.7 × 10-3 mg L-1. For the 1:26 dilution 

calculated detection limit concentration, adsorption capacity and removal percentage 

was 0.22 mg L-1, 11.8 mg g-1 and 98.1%, respectively.

IV. Final Remarks 
_____________________________________________________________!

!
 

The literature reports several constrains with the conventional methods applied 

in saltwater RAS for the removal of phosphate. The alternative methods until now 

exploited, including constructed wetlands, algal ponds and IMTAs, require large areas 

and/or investments. So far oyster-shells were only studied for their ability to remove 

phosphate and some metals. It would be very interesting to see other studies using 

other contaminants. But, if in the future this biosorbent does not show removal 

capacity for more contaminants, its application for treatment of discharge wastewaters 

from marine RAS is still a very a good alternative, since phosphorus is strongly 

overlooked and can reach concentrations in DWW that can surpass admissible values 

of national and European regulations. But because application in such systems has not 

yet been made, more work is encouraged in this area.  

The ability for reutilization, allows application of oyster-shells for other 

purposes after bioremediation. Because saltwater is no longer a concern, the residual 

shells could potentially be used in ways in which they are already implemented, such 

as mixtures of construction materials. On the other hand, the removed phosphate can 

be re-immobilized and separated from the shells and used for growing valued-added 

freshwater or saltwater species. In the future more studies implicating re-use of the 

shells would be interesting.    

To conclude, the designs of any aquaculture effluents treatment need to be 

carefully considered and further developed, optimized and validated for better 

integration in the operational scheme, in order to increase stock production, bearing 

the increase world food needs, while still maintaining social, economic and 

environmental sustainability. Because RAS are being more and more attractive as a 

means of aquaculture production, the development of sustainable and cost-efficient 

wastewater treatment methods will be an important aspect that will contribute to the 

wider use of these systems; and because of its high efficiency, cost-effectiveness, 

non-toxicity and re-usable ability, oyster-shells can be suitable candidates for that.
