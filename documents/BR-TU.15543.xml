Metals and Acid Volatile Sulfide in Sediment Cores from the Sergipe River Estuary,
Northeast, Brazil

Foram estudados o sulfeto volatilizado em meio ácido (AVS), os metais simultaneamente
extraídos (SEM) e os metais em sítios de sedimentos do Estuário do Rio Sergipe, Brasil. As
concentrações de AVS e SEM foram, em geral, maiores nos sedimentos dos sítios situados nas
áreas que recebem maior aporte antrópico devido à poluição urbana. Nesses sítios, o sulfeto
parece ser a principal fase de ligação para os metais. No sítio do sedimento situado na área de
maior influência marinha, as fases mais importantes de ligação para os metais parecem estar
associadas à matéria orgânica e aos carbonatos. Os perfis de AVS permitiram identificar dois
tipos de processos de sedimentação no estuário. Em todos os sítios, as relações SEM/AVS
foram muito menores do que 1.

 Acid volatile sulfide (AVS), simultaneously extracted metals (SEM) and metals were studied
in sediment cores from the Sergipe River Estuary, Brazil. AVS and SEM concentrations were,
in general, higher in the core sediments from areas which receive a higher anthropic contribution
due to urban pollution. In these cores, the sulfide seemed to be the main connection for the
metals. In the core obtained from the area of major marine influence, the most important binding
phases for the metals seemed to be associated with organic matter and carbonates. The AVS
profiles allow identification of two types of sedimentation processes in the estuary. In all cores
SEM/AVS ratios were much lower than 1.

Keywords: sediments, heavy metals, acid volatile sulfide, simultaneously extracted metals

Introduction

 Sediments are formed by deposition of layers of
fine particulate matter onto the beds of rivers, lakes,
estuaries and oceans. They function as an important
compartment of the aquatic ecosystem and serve as
habitat of many species of organisms. They comprise
mineral phases of varied sizes, including clay, silt and
s a n d ,  m i xe d  w i t h  o rga n i c  m a t t e r. A n  i m p o r t a n t
characteristic of sediment is its capacity to serve as a
reservoir for trace metals introduced into the aquatic
environment by natural geochemical processes and
anthropogenic activities.1,2

Di Toro et al. 3 suggest that the concentration of metal
in the pore water can be controlled by acid volatile sulfide
(AVS), via the formation of insoluble metal sulfide
complexes. Several laboratory studies have demonstrated
the AVS influence over the bioavailability and acute

toxicity of divalent metals in aquatic sediments.2,4-6 When
the sediments show excess of AVS in relation to the
simultaneously extracted metals (SEM/AVS&lt;1) the pore
water metal concentrations are considered to be low and
non-toxic.7 Some research has shown a significant
bioaccumulation for sediments with SEM/AVS&lt;1.8,9

The sulfide level in sediments is a function of the
production rate of sulfide by reduction of sulfate, and
the loss rate of sulfide by oxidation reactions and
diffusion processes.10,11

function of porosity, sediment density, mixing intensity,

at the water-sediment interface.12

Consequently, AVS profiles can provide information
describing the depositional process of the sediment in each
core. Some studies of this nature have been carried out.13,14

Oehm et al.15 concluded that only one core cannot
completely represent sedimentation in the environment,



749Alves et al.Vol. 18, No. 4, 2007

due to spatial differences in the supply of reactive organic
matter. Some studies have been carried out in coastal
sediments.

In the present study, three sediment cores from
different locations of the Sergipe River Estuary were
analyzed with the purpose of investigating the AVS, SEM,
total heavy metals and the relationships of these profiles
with the dynamics of the estuarine environment.

Materials and Methods

Study area

The Sergipe River basin is located in the State of
Sergipe, in the Northeast of Brazil. It covers an area of
3673 km2 and has an average flow of 560,000 m3 day-1 in
the rainy season and 70,000 m3 day-1 in the dry season.
The river runs about 210 km from its spring to its mouth
into the Atlantic Ocean in the city of Aracaju, Capital of
the State.16

The study area has an extension of 15 km covering
the lower part of the Sergipe River Estuary and the
estuarine region of the Sal and Poxim Rivers (Figure 1).
Within this area the cities of Aracaju, Nossa Senhora do
Socorro, São Cristovao and Barra dos Coqueiros are
located, which together make up an extension of 859.3
km2 and are home to 37.9% of the population of the State.
The estuary directly receives industrial sewage, dominated
by emissions from food, plastic, textile, ceramic and

metallurgical industries. Domestic sewage waste waters
are also released into the estuary, in natura, from the
neighboring cities, and as the effluent from sewage
treatment facilities in Aracaju.

The estuarine region is characterized by a well-mixed
water column, with a circulation standard mainly
dominated by the tidal currents. Lately, the estuary has
shown hypoxic conditions and characteristics of an
environment in process of eutrophication. The more
impacted areas are those of the Sal and Poxim Rivers,
where the oxygen dissolved in water has shown levels
below 3.00 mg L-1, at some locations reaching values close
to zero.17

Sampling

In the present study, three sediment cores were
collected in September 2004, in the estuarine region
formed by the Sal River (core 1; 10°51´51" S, 37°05´01"

W), Sergipe River (core 8; 10°54´09" S, 37°02´25" W) and
Poxim River (core 19; 10°56´24" S, 37°05´16" W). The
location of the sampling sites is indicated in Figure 1.

The sediments were taken with a core sampler of
cellulose acetate-butyrate pipe type, with precaution to
prevent destruction of the core, using non-metallic devices
to avoid contamination. Each sediment core was field-
sliced at 5 cm interval, as it was expelled from the core
sampler. The samples were rapidly stored in closed plastic
bags with ice to minimize oxidation. The samples to be

used for AVS determination were, as recommended in the
literature,18-20 maintained in the refrigerator at 4 °C and
analyzed within a maximum period of four days after
collection. The samples intended for metal determination
were immediately dried in a forced air circulation oven at
60 °C for 72h (until reaching a constant mass) and then
were homogenized by crushing in a porcelain mortar until
a fine powder was obtained. Following this, they were
sealed in previously cleaned glass flasks until analyzed.

Chemical analyses

The procedure adopted for determining AVS and SEM
was based on the methodology described by Di Toro et al.3

About 12 g of wet sediment at room temperature were
transferred to a closed reaction vessel, connected to a
trapping vessel containing 20 mL of 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH
solution. To the wet sediment sample was added 30 mL
of 0.5 mol L-1 HCl, forming H

2
S which was subsequently

collected in the NaOH solution by purging with N
2
 for 40

minutes. The dissolved sulfide in the NaOH solution was
potentiometrically titrated in an automatic system
(Radiometer TM 865) with a 0.03 mol L-1 AgNO

3
 solution

using a sulfide selective ion electrode with Ag/AgCl
reference electrode.

HCl and sediment mixture in the reaction vessel were
separated by centrifugation and the concentrations of the
simultaneously extracted metals (SEM) in the solution were
determined by flame or graphite furnace atomic absorption
spectrometry (FAAS/GFAAS) (Shimadzu AA-6800).

For evaluating the efficiency of the AVS extraction
method, a standard Na

2
S (79.18 mg L-1) solution was used,

obtaining in three replications an average recovery of 93±3%.
The results of the measurements in duplicate of the AVS
showed an analytical precision of less than 10%. In the
extraction process for AVS determination, blanks with 0.5
mol L-1 HCl solution were prepared similarly to the samples,
and concentrations in the blanks were negligible for all metals
measured in the SEM determination.

Sediment samples (0.5 g), dried to constant mass at
60 °C, were digested in closed Teflon vessels using a
mixture of concentrated HNO

3 
(2 mL), HCl (1 mL) and

HF (4 mL), at 140 °C for 2 hours on a heating block.
After digestion, the Teflon vessels were opened and
maintained at 210 °C until complete dryness. The residue
was dissolved in 10 mL of 0.5 mol L-1 HCl solution and
the final volume made up to 50 mL. The solutions were
stored in polyethylene flasks for later determination of
the metals by flame or graphite furnace atomic
absorption spectrometry. Reagent blanks were prepared
similarly to the samples, and the following certified

sediment standards were analyzed for quality control
purposes: LKSD-1 CCNRP/Canada lake sediment; NCS
DC 75304/China river sediment; NCS DC 78301/China
marine sediment. The results showed that there was no
significant contamination and that the recovery of the
heavy metals in the reference materials was in the range
92-106%.

The measurement of the total carbon content in the
samples was carried out using an Elemental Analyzer
(NCHS-O, Flash EA 1112) with combustion at 900 °C.
The organic carbon content was calculated from the
difference of the carbon values measured before and after
calcination of the samples at 550 °C for 1 hour. For quality
control purposes a certified Lake Sediment standard
(LKSD-1 CCNRP/Canada) was analyzed together with
the samples, obtaining in three replications an average
recovery of 96.3 ± 4.2%.

Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and calculations
of correlation coefficients were carried out using the
program “Statistica for Windows Version 6.0”.

Results and Discussion

Characteristics of the sediments

The chemical characteristics of the sediments in the
three cores are shown in Table 1. The method of Principal
Components Analysis was applied to the sets of chemical
parameters measured in the fractions of the cores with
the objective of detecting a possible grouping between
them. PCA is a non-parametric method of classification,
employed to reduce the dimensionality of a data set while
attempting to preserve the relationships present in the
original data. The method consists in applying the
multivariate statistical analysis on the results obtained,
considering each fraction as an object (5 fractions of core
1; 8 of core 8 and 8 of core 19) and the parameters
measured as variables (12 variables). With the purpose of
assuring that the relative influences of the different
variables on the model were independent of the units of
these variables, the columns of the data matrix were self-
assigned so that the new variables had zero average and
unit variance.

Two principal components were extracted, together
representing 76.8 % of the total variance ( t

1
 57.0%; t

2

19.8%). Based on the weight of the contribution of each
variable in the PCA (Table 2) it can be seen that Cu, Cd,
Ni, Zn, Cr, Al and C

 are strongly associated with

component t
1
 and Mn and Pb with component t

2
.

The location of each fraction on the coordinate plan
formed by the two components t

 and t

 is shown in Figure

2. The first component (t
1
) separated the core 1 fractions

(negative part of t
1
) from the core 19 fractions (positive

part of t
1
). The fractions located in the negative region of

t
1
 (core 1) show higher contents of Cu, Cd, Ni, Zn, Cr, Al

and C
org

. The second component (t
2
) separated the core 8

fractions (negative part of t
2
) from the core 1 and 19

fractions (positive part of t
2
). Mn and Pb principally

contributed to this separation, with the fractions of the
negative region of t

2
 showing higher concentrations of

Mn and lower concentrations of Pb.
The organic carbon has a significant participation in

the construction of component 1, evidenced by the
association of these variables with the anthropic input due
to urban pollution. On the negative side of t

1,
 the metal

concentration increases and on the negative side of t
2
, the

concentration of Mn increases and Pb decreases.
Therefore, core 1 is mostly distinguished from the others
by showing a higher metal average concentration (except
Mn), associated with a higher anthropic contribution,
while the principal characteristics of core 8 are the high
Mn concentrations and lower Pb concentrations.

the concentrations of AVS were higher than the
concentrations of SEM, consequently the SEM/AVS
relationships were much less than 1 and the SEM-AVS
differences less than zero. When the SEM/AVS molar
proportions are less than 1, the concentrations of the metals
in the pore water are supposed to be small and non-toxic
and, therefore, the sediments should not present acute
toxicity for aquatic organisms concerning heavy metal
contents.7

In core 1, the AVS varied between 13.7 and 23.7 ?mol
g-1, with a peak at 5 cm. In core 8, the AVS varied between
1.9 and 13.6 ?mol g-1, with a very low concentration at
the surface, a peak at 5-10 cm, and concentrations
decreasing gradually down to a depth of 25 cm and then
remaining about constant. In these two cores, the AVS
distribution profiles are characterized by peaks a few
centimeters beneath the water-sediment interface. These
profiles are typical for non-steady depositional processes
with instabilities during deposition, such as changes of
the size of the particles, in the permeability, porosity

etc.13,21 In core 1, the AVS concentrations were higher than
in core 8; this difference can be attributed to the higher
content of organic matter in the sediments of core 1, caused
by the effluent input from the sewage treatment station in
that region. The least concentrations in the top layer are
due to the transference of O

2
 from the overlying water to

the surface sediments, leading to reduction of the AVS
concentration by oxidation.22 This profile format was
observed in cores of sediments of lake Donghu (China)23

and was attributed to the large flow of organic matter to
the sediments, originating in domestic and industrial
sewage released into the lake. As the generation of AVS
occurs through reduction of sulfate to sulfide by sulfate
reducing bacteria, and these organisms need carbon for
their metabolism,24 the presence of large quantities of
organic matter potentially contributes to making the
sediment anoxic, inhibiting oxidation of AVS in the surface
layers. Core 8 was collected in a region of major marine
influence and in that region, probably, SO

2– concen-
trations (20-30 mmol L-1) in marine sediments, compared
with those of the fresh water sediments (0.2 mmol L-1)
can account for a greater part of the anoxic oxidation
processes in those sediments.31

 In core 19, the AVS varied between 2.2 and 18.0 ?mol
g-1. The AVS content was lower at the surface and showed

an increase along its profile with peaks at 15 and 35 cm.
The profile showed a high gradient with a more or less
continuous increase in AVS content with depth. In
accordance with Van der Berg et al.13 this profile indicates
a deposition process in steady state with limitations by

characterized by a low average deposition rate.

Gerritse argues that the low speed of deposition leads to
the formation of higher quantities of sulfide in the more
anoxic layers, because more sulfate is reduced per unit of
depth.25 This profile has been reported in distribution
studies of AVS in sediments.26-30

The first concepts concerning the control and
abundance of AVS in anoxic marine sediments were
established in the late 1970s. It was observed that in rapidly
deposited sediments AVS tends to occur in greater
proportion relative to pyrite and that, in sediments which
accumulate slowly, AVS is a small fraction of total reduced
sulfide (TRS) or even absent, even when pyrite is present
in abundance. The low abundance of AVS is due to the
rapid and complete transformation of FeS to pyrite in the
upper sediment layer. The slow accumulation process
favours direct formation of pyrite from H

2
S, which can

lead to relatively little AVS.32

One of the first studies concerning the behaviour of
AVS in marine sediments (Aller, 1977, in Morse and
Rickard33) considers AVS as comprising FeS or a mixture
of metastable iron sulfides. Maximum AVS occurs within
the zone of greatest TRS formation and coincides with
the depth at which dissolved Fe decreases to very low
levels and dissolved sulfide increases rapidly. Aller’s
conclusion is that the reservoir of FeS at any given depth
is the result of the balance obtained between the rates of
FeS formation (HS– production, and reaction with Fe) and
loss (conversion to pyrite, oxidation to Fe3+, SO

4
2–), at that

depth.
In a recent review article on AVS Rickard and Morse32

cite several studies which used a 35S tracer to investigate
the mechanisms controlling the relationship AVS-pyrite.
In the work of Panutrakul et al.,34 on sediments of the
Scheldt estuary in Belgium, using 35SO

4
2–, the main final

product was found to be AVS (70-80%), except in
superficial sediments where pyrite and So predominated,
indicating the oxidation of sulphide. Close to the surface
of sediments (0-5 cm) AVS constituted around 13% of
TRS, reaching around 30% in deeper layers. According
to Rickard and Morse,32 these observations could indicate
that in the deeper sediment layers the net sulfide
production (formation minus oxidation) is greater than
the rate of conversion of AVS to pyrite. Preservation of
AVS is favoured by rapid deposition and by low oxygen
availability at the sediment-water interface. During rapid

of the total metals and SEM for the three cores.

In core 1, the Cu, Pb and Zn profiles are similar and
indicate increasing concentrations with depth. Cd showed
little variation, with similar concentrations at the different
depths. Ni showed an enrichment as far as 10 cm of depth
and then its concentration was reduced, becoming similar
to the upper layers.

Core 8 showed similar profiles for Ni, Pb e Zn, with a
general enrichment of the metals with depth. The Cd
concentration decreased along the profile and the Cu
concentration showed a profile different from the other
metals, with peaks at 10 and 40 cm of depth.

Core 19 showed a general enrichment with depth for
Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn and presented a peak at 15 cm. In spite
of Cd presenting a peak at 15 cm, it did not show any
enrichment with depth.

In relatively stable aquatic environments, an
enrichment of metals in the surface layer of the sediment
is expected as a result of inputs related to industrial
activities and urban development.35 In the region under
study, mainly cores 1 and 19 were obtained from locations
that in recent years have shown significant urban and

industrial growth. Notwithstanding, in the studied cores
enrichment of metals was detected in the surface layer
due to the fact that the sediments reflect a non-stable
sedimentation process, as a function of the depositional
dynamic of the estuarine environments. Similar
observations have been made for sediments of the Pearl
River in China.14

In general, the vertical distribution of the SEM showed
for each metal the same distribution trend as that of the
total metal. The SEM concentrations for most of the metals
represented a relatively large fraction of the total metal
concentrations (Figure 7). The highest SEM/metal ratios
were shown by Cd in cores 1 and 8 (from 51 to 97% of
the total Cd) and by Cd and Zn in core 19 (from 27 to
72% of the total metal), followed by Pb in core 8 (from
17 to 59%) and Zn in core 1 (from 26 to 49%). In the
three cores, the ratios varied from about 6 to 40%, with
Cu presenting lowest ratios (1 to 5%). High SEM/metal
ratios may indicate that the AVS was the most important
phase for the metals in the sediment. The low Cu

SEM
/Cu

ratio was probably due to the metal not being sufficiently
soluble in HCl under the AVS extraction conditions. Some
work has shown that Cu2+ is more strongly associated with
the organic phase of the sediments and that this can have
a minor contribution in the binding of Cu2+ to the
sediment.36-38

correlation between the AVS and the SME was detected,
indicating that in these sediments, sulfide does not seem

demonstrated that the main difference between the
sediments of core 8 and the sediments of cores 1 and 19
are the high manganese concentrations. Therefore, it is
possible that in core 8 the more important phases of the
SEM-binding are associated with the carbonates and the
organic matter. Manganese and iron are considered
conveyors of trace elements to the sediments by means of

mechanisms such as precipitation (hydroxides, sulfides,
carbonates) and adsorption, mainly in the formation of
oxides and hydroxides.40-42 Much reactive manganese
enters the sediments as Mn (IV) oxide, which frequently
is reduced in anoxic sediments, before the reduction of
the sulfide. This results in the formation of a Mn (II)
reservoir, normally associated with the carbonate phase,
as rhodocrosite-calcite or dolomite of the Ca-Mn type.
So, much reduced manganese cannot be available for the
formation of mineral sulfide.43-45

Yu et al.,46 when studying the spatial distribution of
the AVS and SEM in sediment cores of the Ell-Ren River
(Taiwan), detected the existence, besides AVS, of other

binding phases for the SEM, that is, the total
concentration of the SEM does not correspond only to
the metals bound to AVS. Comparing the spatial
distribution of the SEM/AVS relationship with several
binding phases in extremely anoxic sediments (redox
potential between –115 and –208 mV), they concluded
that the organic phases and the carbonates were, after
the AVS, the principal binding phases for the SEM. They
also observed that in slightly anoxic sediments (redox
potential between –50 and –130 mV), the iron oxides
were the additional principal phase for zinc and the
organic matter for copper. In all cases, the AVS seemed
to have binding priority for the SEM.

AVS was not the most important binding phase for the
metals in surface sediments of the Pearl River Estuary
and therefore the SEM may contain different chemical
forms of the trace elements, depending on the reaction of
the metal with cold HCl.14

Therefore, the results stress the need of carrying out
sequential extraction for a better understanding of SEM
and its association with the different geochemical phases
of the sediment, even when the concentration of AVS is
high and greater than that of SEM.

Conclusions

This study presents trace metals, AVS and SEM
profiles in sediment cores taken at different locations in
an estuarine system formed by the Sal river (core 1),
Sergipe river (core 8) and Poxim river (core 19).
Multivariate statistical analysis, applied to the full
dataset, allowed distinctions to be made between the
different cores. Core 1 is mainly distinguished from the
others by showing higher average metal concentrations
(except Mn), associated with a higher anthropic
contribution, while the principal characteristics of core
8 are the high Mn concentrations and lower Pb
concentrations.

Based on the AVS profiles in each core, two types of
sedimentation processes were identified, a non–steady
process with instabilities during deposition (cores 1 and
8) and a depositional process in steady state characterized
by a low average deposition rate (core 19). Preservation
of AVS is favoured by low oxygen concentrations in the
overlying water.

In the sediments from the estuarine region of the Sal
and Poxim Rivers, the sulfide seems to be the principal
metal-binding phase, while in the region of the Sergipe
river the most important metal-binding phase seems to be
associated with the organic mater and the carbonates. The
elevated concentrations of manganese in sediments from
the Sergipe river region could have resulted in formation
of a large sink reservoir of Mn(II), associated with the
carbonates phase. In all three cores, SEM/AVS ratios were
much less than 1.
