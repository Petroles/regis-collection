Abstract 

Coatings are frequently applied on molds and accessories for the glass industry in 

order to restrict surface degradation such as oxidation, corrosion, abrasion and wear of the 

structural material, thereby decreasing the maintenance costs and increasing the lifetime and 

performance of the components. However, in order to obtain accurate lifetime expectancies 

and performance of the coatings it is necessary to have a complete reliable understanding of 

their properties. 

This thesis is on the improvement of the surface properties and integrity of molds, in 

order to increase their durability, through the application of different types of coatings. Two 

methodologies were followed to reach such demands: (i) optimization of coatings currently 

used in molds surface protection (Ni-based alloys deposited by Plasma Transferred Arc - 

PTA); (ii) synthesis and characterization of new coatings with improved functionalities, 

deposited by emergent deposition processes such as APS - Atmospheric Plasma Spraying 

(effect of nanostructured ZrO2 additions on Ni-based alloy coatings) and DCRMS - Direct 

Current Reactive Magnetron Sputtering (influence of V additions on the properties of 

TiSi(V)N thin films). 

The dilution of the substrate in PTA process was shown to strongly influence the 

structure and, consequently, the hardness, the oxidation resistance and the tribological 

behavior of the coatings; with increasing dilution, a detrimental effect on these properties was 

observed due to the incorporation of base material. However, in relation to the tribological 

behavior, a beneficial effect at high temperature was demonstrated due to the fast formation of 

oxide layers which protect the coating surface against wear. The post-weld heat treatment 

performed at coatings reduced the hardness of the partially melted and heat affected zones 

without affecting the coatings hardness; whereas the coatings hardness and wear resistance 

was improved with annealing treatment. Thus, the best performing coating could only be 

achieved by a proper selection of the deposition conditions, in order to get the best 

compromise between mechanical properties, high temperature oxidation behavior and wear 

resistance of the coatings. 

The impact promoted by nanostructured ZrO2 additions on the microstructure of a Ni-

based alloy depended on the way how the coatings were deposited by APS process, using: (i) 

nanostructured ZrO2 and Ni-alloy powders previously mixed by mechanical alloying or (ii)

the same powders supplied separately. A homogeneous and compact microstructure with 

small zirconia particles evenly distributed in the matrix was achieved in the first case, while a 

porous microstructure, full of semi-melted Ni powders with large particles of ZrO2 entrapped 

in their boundaries, suggesting a brittle behavior, was deposited in the second. In both cases 

the hardness and wear behavior of ZrO2 rich coatings were improved in relation to the Ni-

based alloy. The coatings deposited from mechanically alloyed powders revealed to be much 

more tribologically performing due to their compact structure and even distribution of 

zirconia particles. All the APS coatings showed higher hardness values than the Ni-based 

coatings deposited by PTA; however, their micro-abrasion resistance was worse, due to the 

lack of cohesion between the powders. 

The analysis by XRD of the structure of V rich TiSi(V)N coatings, deposited by 

DCRMS, revealed that V incorporation in the TiSiN system shifted the peaks to higher 

angles, indicating the formation of a substitutional solid solution based on TiN phase, where 

Ti atoms are replaced by the smaller V ones. On the other hand, by similar reason, XRD of 

TiSiN films revealed that a nanocomposite structure consisting of TiN grains enrobed by a Si-

N matrix was not formed. In fact, with Si addition a shift of the diffraction peaks of TiN phase 

to higher angles was observed which, in combination with similar compressive residual 

stresses, also supported the formation of a substitutional solid solution. V additions showed to 

successfully improve the hardness and tribological behavior of TiSi(V)N films, as a result of 

the substitutional solid solution formation. On the other hand, the formation of the V2O5 phase 

during the sliding contact acts as a lubricious tribo-film, protecting the coating against wear. 

The addition of Si or V strongly influenced in opposite directions the oxidation resistance of 

the coatings. Si incorporations in TiN increased significantly the oxidation resistance of the 

films, whereas the opposite occurred in V containing coatings. In this latter case, the rapid V 

ions out-diffusion through the oxide scale inhibited the formation of a continuous protective 

silicon oxide layer, which is responsible for the excellent oxidation behavior of TiSiN films. 

V rich coatings showed lower oxidation resistance than PTA-deposited Ni-based coatings, but 

superior hardness values and better tribological behavior was found in relation to both PTA 

and APS deposited coatings.

Resumo 

Frequentemente são aplicados diferentes tipos de revestimentos em moldes e 

acessórios para a indústria do vidro, de forma a atenuar a degradação das suas superfícies, 

devida às condições extremas de oxidação, corrosão, abrasão e desgaste a que estão sujeitas. 

Deste modo, é possível, diminuir os custos de manutenção e aumentar o tempo de vida e a 

eficácia destes componentes. No entanto, de forma a maximizar o desempenho dos 

revestimentos, é necessário compreender a inter-relação entre as suas caraterísticas e 

propriedades funcionais. 

Esta tese é dedicada à melhoria das propriedades da superfície dos moldes, de forma a 

aumentar a sua durabilidade e desempenho, através da aplicação de diferentes tipos de 

revestimentos. No sentido de enfrentar este desafio, foram seguidas duas metodologias 

alternativas: (i) otimização de revestimentos já utilizados na proteção da superfície de moldes 

(ligas à base de Ni depositadas por PTA* (plasma de arco transferido); (ii) síntese e 

caracterização de novos revestimentos mais resistente e com melhores propriedades, 

depositados por processos de deposição emergentes no mercado, tal como são os casos do 

APS** - projeção em plasma atmosférico (efeito da adição de ZrO2 nanoestruturada numa 

liga à base de níquel) e do PVD*** - deposição física em fase de vapor (influência da adição 

de V nas propriedades de revestimentos cerâmicos do sistema TiSi(V)N). 

A diluição do substrato, promovida pelo processo PTA, mostrou influenciar a estrutura 

e, consequentemente, diminuir a dureza, a resistência à oxidação e a resistência ao desgaste à 

temperatura ambiente dos revestimentos à base de Ni. No entanto, teve um efeito benéfico no 

comportamento tribológico a temperaturas elevadas, permitindo a rápida formação de uma 

camada de óxido, que protege a superfície contra o desgaste. O tratamento térmico efectuado 

aos revestimentos após deposição reduziu a dureza das zonas termicamente afetada pelo calor 

e parcialmente fundida. Além disso, o tratamento de envelhecimento realizado aos 

revestimentos permitiu aumentar a sua dureza e a sua resistência ao desgaste. Assim, o 

revestimento com melhor desempenho só pode ser obtido selecionando criteriosamente as 

condições de deposição que originam o melhor compromisso entre propriedades mecânicas, 

comportamento à oxidação a alta temperatura e resistência ao desgaste.

A adição de zircónia nano-estruturada à liga de níquel depositada por APS tem um 

impacto diferente na microestrutura dos revestimentos, consoante são usados pós de Ni e 

ZrO2 previamente misturados por síntese mecânica ou os mesmos pós alimentados 

separadamente. Quando depositados com os pós preparados por síntese mecânica, os 

revestimentos exibiram uma estrutura homogénea e compacta com pequenas partículas de 

zircónia uniformemente distribuídas na matriz de Ni. Por outro lado, quando depositados 

separadamente foi obtida uma estrutura muito porosa com pós de Ni semi-fundidos e com 

partículas de ZrO2 inseridas na sua interface, sugerindo um comportamento frágil. 

Independente do procedimento de deposição, em ambos os casos a dureza e a resistência ao 

desgaste dos revestimentos foi melhorada com a adição de ZrO2. Contudo, os revestimentos 

depositados usando pós produzidos por síntese mecânica revelaram possuir melhor 

performance, devido à sua estrutura compacta e distribuição uniforme da ZrO2. Todos os 

revestimentos depositados por APS revelaram possuir valores de dureza superiores aos 

revestimentos depositados por PTA; no entanto, a sua resistência à abrasão mostrou ser 

bastante inferior devido à falta de coesão entre os pós. 

As análises de difracção de raios-X realizadas aos filmes TiSi(V)N ricos em V 

revelaram que os picos de difracção se deslocam para ângulos superiores com o aumento do 

teor em V, sugerindo a formação de uma solução sólida substitucional, com o V de menor 

raio atómico a substituir átomos de Ti na estrutura de base do TiN. Por outro lado, a análise 

realizada aos revestimentos de TiSiN revelou que a estrutura nanocompósita (grãos de TiN 

envolvidos numa matriz de Si-N) não foi alcançada. Com efeito, a adição de Si ao sistema 

TiN também deslocou os picos de difracção para ângulos superiores o que, considerando o 

mesmo nível de tensões residuais medidos em todos os revestimentos, indicou a formação de 

uma solução sólida substitucional onde os átomos mais pequenos de Si substituíram os 

átomos de Ti na rede do TiN. A adição de V ao sistema TiSiN permitiu melhorar as 

propriedades mecânicas e tribológicas devido à formação da solução sólida substitucional. A 

melhoria das propriedades tribológicas está relacionada com a formação da fase V2O5, no 

topo da superfície do filme, que age como lubrificante sólido e, portanto, protege o 

revestimento do desgaste. A resistência à oxidação de revestimentos ricos em Si e V mostrou 

ser influenciada em sentidos contrários por estes elementos. Assim, a adição de Si ao sistema 

TiN aumentou significativamente a resistência à oxidação dos filmes enquanto a adição de V 

ao sistema TiSiN promoveu uma diminuição abruta na resistência à oxidação. Esta 

diminuição da resistência à oxidação foi atribuída à rápida difusão dos iões de V através da

camada de óxido formada, que inibiu a formação de uma camada contínua e protectora de 

óxido de silício, contrariamente ao que acontece nos revestimentos TiSiN. Os filmes ricos em 

V apresentaram menor resistência à oxidação do que os revestimentos espessos depositados 

por PTA; no entanto, a sua dureza e resistência ao desgaste foram bastante superiores à dos 

revestimentos espessos depositados por PTA ou APS.

Chapter I 

1. Introduction 

The necessity for higher performance and increased efficiency of components working 

in extreme harsh conditions has been met with the use of more advanced materials. Coatings 

have been developed over the last decades as a potential solution for these applications due to 

their superior properties when compared to bulk materials, allowing extending the 

performance and lifetime of components. This was the case of the glass industry, where the 

components are actually coated with hard and wear resistant materials in order to resist to the 

direct contact with the melted glass which promotes very severe abrasion, corrosion and 

fatigue at high temperature. The current European glass container market is approximately 30-

40 billions of containers. Due to globalization, there has been a growing demand for glass 

containers production at reduced costs, with increasing shape complexity, putting an 

increasing pressure on glass producers who are seeking molds which allow increasing 

production rates with higher quality. In these very harsh conditions, further degradation of the 

mold surfaces occurs due to more intense thermal cycles leading to higher mechanical strains 

and plastic deformation with the consequent fatigue, oxidation and wear problems. 

Furthermore, other common problems such as worn-out geometries or surface and base 

material cracks, often lead to the breakdown of the coating after few working cycles. The 

combined effect of the harsh conditions with a faulty design or a defective material, 

associated with bad working practices, induces the premature failure of the components. 



Chapter I - Introduction 

2 
Filipe Daniel Fernandes 

Besides the direct costs of the molds, there is a direct impact on the production due to the 

increasing machine down times, higher process instability, poor product quality and higher 

maintenance costs. Therefore, any optimized solution to achieve the best performance of 

molds should be focused on the proper selection of the base material, the coating and its 

deposition process. Unfortunately, the lack of credible solutions have limited the application 

of coated components in glass industry, hiding the great relevance and impact they could have 

for the industrial development in this area. Thus, this thesis is devoted to the improvement of 

surface properties and integrity of molds, in order to improve their durability, through either 

the optimization of conventional coatings currently applied on mold surfaces or the 

development of new coating systems deposited by emergent technologies. Both cases show 

potential to over-support the in service conditions of the molds, allowing improving their 

ratability, lifetime and performance. 

Presently, the molds for glass industry are manufactured either in low cost materials, 

such as cast iron and low carbon steel, offering a good relative performance at high 

temperature, or in copper-nickel alloys (bronze), due to their excellent thermal conductivity 

combined with reasonable hardness and wear resistance, which allow an increasing 

production rate of glass containers. In some cases, specific zones of the molds are coated, 

mainly with Fe, Co or Ni-based alloys, with the aim of increasing their service life, owing to 

their excellent oxidation and mechanical performance under high temperature conditions. 

Several hardfacing and thermal spraying processes have been used to coat the molds: i) 

Plasma Transferred Arc (PTA), and Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) and ii) Flame 

Spraying (FS) and High Velocity oxy Fuel (HVOF), respectively. Hardfacing processes have 

been preferentially used in the protection of molds surface, due to the strong metallurgical 

bond promoted between the coating and substrate, condition required to avoid the catastrophic 

failure in service. In thermal spraying processes only a mechanical bonding is established.  

Among the hardfacing processes referred above, PTA has been the most versatile and 

used, due to its ability to deposit very thick coatings with low porosity and high production 

rates. However, the final quality of coatings is largely influenced by the process parameters; 

their incorrect selection leads frequently to problems such as the formation of porosity or 

cracks in both the coating and the substrate, lack of adhesion of the coating to the substrate 

and changes in the chemical composition of the coating metal alloy, compromising the 

performance in service. Hence, a reliable understanding of the influence of the deposition 

parameters on the coatings properties is required, in order to optimize the lifetime 

expectancies and performance of the coatings. Presently, the tendency is to increase the 



Chapter I – Introduction 

3 
Filipe Daniel Fernandes 

dilution of the substrate to avoid adhesion problems and, therefore, not to compromise the 

molds life, even if the mechanical properties, oxidation resistance and wear performance are 

deteriorated. This will be the first issue in discussion in this thesis: how the increase in 

dilution of the base material (cast iron), induced by the change in arc current, influences the 

properties of Ni-based coatings deposited by the PTA process.  

An alternative route to improve the quality and performance of molds is the use of 

new, thick or thin coatings deposited by emerging technologies that can lead to significant 

improvements on the mechanical properties. Atmospheric Plasma Spraying (APS) and 

Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) are good examples of these deposition processes which 

allow to achieve either metallic, ceramic or composite coatings. Such technologies and 

materials have shown already to be potential candidates for improving the performance of 

mechanical components and parts used in other industries where high oxidation, corrosion 

and wear resistances are required. When compared to traditional deposition processes (PTA, 

GTAW and FS), their main disadvantage is related to their high cost of investment and 

production and, in some cases, lower coatings adhesion. Therefore, any development on this 

field for molds protection should be focused on solutions that withstand the severe conditions 

to which molds are submitted, extending their service life sufficiently, in order to justify their 

higher cost. This is the second part of this thesis: new solutions based on thick and thin 

coatings, deposited by APS and PVD processes, respectively. In the first case, the influence of 

nanostructured ZrO2 additions to Ni-based alloy coatings deposited by APS process was 

studied. The idea of this study was to take advantage of the high hardness and oxidation 

resistance of ZrO2 to improve the oxidation resistance and the mechanical and wear properties 

of Ni-based coatings. In relation to other thermal spraying processes, such as HVOF, APS 

was selected due to its high potential to deposit materials with high melting temperature 

(which is the case of ZrO2), although lower particles velocities are achieved; furthermore, in 

relation to the PTA process, APS normally gives rise to coatings with much higher hardness. 

Apart from the higher cost, the main disadvantage of APS coatings is the need of their 

subsequent fusion when applied in parts for the glass industry, in order to obtain compact and 

more performing coatings; the application of this operation is not covered in this thesis.  

On the other hand, PVD technique has been extensively used to develop new coating 

materials, due to its versatility. This process allows "sweep" the chemical composition of a 

coating system composed by two or more chemical elements, by changing the deposition 

parameters, producing small quantities of material that can be characterized in order to 

optimize the best formulation. Moreover, in comparison to thick coatings, PVD allows the

deposition of films with much better properties, particularly the mechanical properties, for 

which it is common to have improvements of two to four times. However, despite the 

excellent properties of the films and the versatility of the process, its application in 

components for the glass industry has been postponed, since the much smaller thickness, in 

the micrometer order, has been seen unattractive to the industrial eyes when compared to 

thick coatings. However, the experience gained in the application of such PVD films in other 

fields of the metalworking industries (for example in machining, stamping, etc), where the 

life-time of the coated parts has been easily increased by one to two orders of magnitude, 

allows predicting the success of these films in the protection of molds surfaces for the glass 

industry. Over the last decades a large number of films (ceramic and composite) have been 

developed for high temperature applications, among which the most studied systems were 

nitrides, carbides and oxides of Ti, Cr or Al, whose properties (mechanical, oxidation, 

corrosion, wear, etc) have been successfully improved by the addition of other chemical 

elements. One of the biggest advantages of thin coatings over thick ones is the possibility of 

using ceramics as protection material. In fact, ceramic materials cannot be used in the surface 

protection of molds for glass parts, due to their low thermal conductivity, which impede the 

efficient cooling of the base material, decreasing the productivity of the process. This 

difficulty can be overcome if these materials are deposited as thin coatings.  

In this thesis, the addition of a specific element (vanadium) to ceramic films (TiSiN), 

deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering, was studied. TiSiN is one of the best PVD 

deposited coatings for high temperature applications and, with V incorporation, it is expected 

to improve the mechanical properties and, at the same time, make them self-lubricant at high 

temperatures. Currently, in the glass containers production, the walls of the molds are 

frequently wet with liquid lubricant to avoid the adhesion of the melted glass to the molds 

surface facilitating the removal of glass containers. Frequently, these lubricants (graphite 

based lubricants) contain small amounts of sulfur which combined to oxygen forms sulfuric 

acid that erodes the mold surfaces creating holes and, therefore, defects that lead to the 

premature failure of the mold. Although V additions have been reported to improve the 

mechanical properties and the tribological performance of some binary and ternary coating 

systems, at high temperature V rapidly diffuses to the surface leading to the loss of its 

lubricious effect after a critical short time. Hence, TiSiN system was selected due to its very 

high oxidation resistance, similar to the ternary systems CrAlN and TiAlN, where V 

incorporation was already studied, but with much better mechanical properties. Moreover, if 

deposited with a nanocomposite structure (TiN grains embedded in a Si3N4 matrix) by

changing the thickness of the antidiffusion barrier Si3N4 matrix, the control of V diffusion can 

be achieved.  

Thus, the objectives of this research can be summarized as follows: 

 

i) To analyze the effect of the arc current variation on the substrate dilution and, therefore, on 

the chemical composition, microstructure, oxidation and tribological performance of Ni-based 

coatings deposited by PTA process over gray cast iron. The influence of an annealing 

treatment on the morphology, mechanical properties, and wear performance of coatings will 

be also discussed. 

 

ii) To study the influence of the addition of nanostructured ZrO2 to Ni-based coatings, 

deposited by APS process, on their microstructure, mechanical properties and tribological 

performance. The properties of the composite coatings will be compared with those of the 

unmodified Ni and nanostructured ZrO2 coatings. 

 

iii) To study the influence of V additions on the microstructure, mechanical properties, 

oxidation and tribological behavior of TiSi(V)N thin films, containing different Si and V 

contents, deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering. The properties of the V rich 

coatings will be compared with TiSiN, TiN and TiVN coatings deposited as reference; special 

attention will be focused on the oxidation mechanisms occurring during high temperature 

exposure. 

 

Taking into account these objectives, besides this introductory part, this thesis is 

organized in six chapters. In chapter II, a historical perspective is presented about the main 

problems addressed in molds for glass containers production, as well as on the main materials 

and protection processes currently and possible use on their fabrication. In chapter III, IV and 

V, the main achievements resulting from the experimental work on the deposition and 

characterization of the coatings will be analyzed in relation to the three deposition techniques 

above presented. Finally, in chapter VI the outputs of this thesis, a comparative synthesis and 

discussion of all the results and future research topics will be presented. 

The structure of the thesis is based on a short presentation and synthesis of the 

research work performed in the scope of each deposition technique, which is further 

supported by the papers already published and/or under submission by the author. The 

chapters dedicated to the experimental studies are as follows:

Chapter II 
In the current chapter, the base and coating materials, processes of deposition currently used in molds protection 

and the main causes for failure problems are reviewed. Moreover, an overview of possible solutions, regarding 

processes and materials, for improving the efficiency of molds is presented. 

2. Historical perspective 

Glass was discovered by the Phoenicians around the year of 3000 BC. The history tells 

that glass was discovered when these explorers lit fires near the beaches and observed the 

changes occurring to the sand under the action of the intense heat of the fire. Time passed and 

Romans began to master the technique of glass production being able to produce some 

rudimentary bottles, intended for the storage of a large variety of liquids. Over the following 

centuries, glass containers progressed significantly from the design point of view, having been 

regarded as a luxury item in the middle age. At that time, only few wealthiest families used 

glass containers to the storage of perfumes and other liquids. The industrialization of glass 

containers started in England in the year 1600 when the coal was introduced as a solid fuel. 

The glass containers were originally produced manually, but due to the increasing market 

demand associated to technological development, in the XIX century glass production started 

to be mechanically automated. Glass containers were seen as an ecologic and versatile 

product, giving rise to their rapid expansion through the market. Since then, to achieve the 

required higher production rates to satisfy the market needs, the use of more advanced 

materials was always the preferred solution. During the 20th century, materials science and 



Chapter II - Historical Perspective 

10 
Filipe Daniel Fernandes 

technology knowledge was introduced in the industry and, from the second half of the 

century, researchers and engineers poured a part of the materials development efforts on the 

modification of materials surface through coatings application. Their superior properties when 

compared to bulk materials, allowed extending the performance and lifetime of components 

working in severe conditions. Since then, application of coatings has been one of the preferred 

ways to modify the surface of materials permitting to extend their use to new potential 

applications. 

In glass industry, molds and accessories are in direct contact with the melted glass 

(temperature about 1050 ºC) being submitted to very severe abrasion, corrosion, wear and 

fatigue at high temperature. Molds, mouthpieces and plungers used for glass production are 

shown in Figure 2.1. These mechanical components started to be produced in gray cast iron 

and low carbon steel due to their relatively good high-temperature performance, allowing 

keeping a fairly acceptable thermal conductivity, at an extremely low cost [1, 2]. In fact, the 

functionality of these materials was not only to support the severe environment high-

temperature conditions but also to provide an efficient heat transfer which allows to rapidly 

cool down the melted glass in order to either decrease the time of containers production or 

obtain products without glass distorting under its own weight [2, 3]. Therefore, later on, 

copper-alloys (bronze-aluminum) have been introduced as mold material due to their superior 

thermal conductivity combined with good properties of hardness and wear resistance [4]. 

These materials allowed increasing production rates, despite of their much higher cost when 

compared to the previous ferrous alloys. Independently of the mold material, some cooling 

channels and fins had been performed in some components in order to help the heat 

extraction.

The higher oxidation and wear resistance required at high temperatures (HT) for 

achieving higher production rates, in order to satisfy market demands, led to the application of 

new high performing bulk materials, such as Ni cast alloys, that allowed extend service life of 

components [5, 6]. However, despite of their excellent performance at high temperature, their 

price of acquisition/production was extremely high which have hindered their widespread 

application in glass industry. Nevertheless, their attractive properties at high temperatures 

pushed to overcome the cost barrier by their application under the form of thick coatings on 

components fabricated in cheaper base materials. Currently, the molds are made in a low 

performing low cost material (such as the mentioned above, i.e. cast iron, low carbon steel 

and copper alloys) but coated in specific zones with hard and more resistant HT alloys, 

allowing to support the harsh service conditions [2, 3, 7, 8]. The base material provides the 

necessary mechanical strength to resist to the overall applied loads and the thermal fatigue, 

whereas the coatings allow extending these properties to an upper end of their performance 

capabilities while protecting them against wear, corrosion, oxidation, abrasion, etc [9, 10]. 

Even if the material withstands high temperature conditions without coating, the life period of 

the component can be enhanced. In conclusion, the advantages of coatings application can be 

summarized as follows [9, 11, 12]: 

 

? Cost of the coating is significantly lower than that of a component integrally fabricated 

in HT alloys. 

? Unique structures and microstructures can be achieved in coatings which are not 

possible in bulk materials.  

? Very high flexibility concerning the chemical composition of the deposited material 

allowing the best selection and consequent optimization for a specific 

solicitation/application. 

? With coatings, surface properties can be improved keeping the required mechanical 

properties in the bulk of the structural component. 

 

A wide variety of coating materials, such as cobalt, iron and nickel alloys, has been 

successfully used to extend the working life of molds [2, 13-15]. The selection of the 

appropriate coating composition depends on the environment to which the coating is exposed 

and the substrate on which it is applied. The complexity of interactions between environment, 

coating and substrate makes the design and selection of coatings very hard and, in general, a 



Chapter II - Historical Perspective 

12

compromise should be achieved between the mechanical strength, the corrosion/oxidation 

resistance and the adhesion. Among the above referred coatings, nickel-based superalloys 

have gained an important role for the protection of surfaces of components for the glass 

industry, due to their excellent performance under conditions of abrasion, corrosion, wear and 

oxidation at elevated temperature, at a reasonable low cost [16-19]. Ni alloys typically used in 

molds protection are divided into two groups: chromium-containing and chromium-free, e.g 

NiCrBSi and NiBSi, respectively. The chromium containing alloys are characterized as low 

Cr (~8 wt%), medium Cr (~11 wt%) and high Cr (~20 wt%) [20]. The alloys compositions 

can be varied in order to optimize specific properties, such as the tribological behavior, the 

oxidation resistance, the wettability, etc. Nickel, as the base element of Ni-based alloys, is 

responsible for the excellent oxidation and corrosion resistance at high temperature [21, 22]. 

Other properties can be achieved with alloying elements. B is added to reduce the melting 

point of these alloys (concentrations up to 2.5 wt%) favoring the manufacturing ability [22, 

23]. Silicon increases the self-fluxing properties, the castability and the wetting characteristics 

[22]. Both B and Si act as deoxidizers, forming borosilicate phases, which prevent the 

oxidation of the active elements in the alloys [24]. B and C react with chromium to produce 

hard borides and carbides and, hence, rising the cavitation and wear resistance of the coatings 

[25, 26]. Cr and Al form chromia and alumina which improve the protection of the coatings 

against oxidation [27, 28]. The addition of hard and stable carbides and oxides, such as WC, 

CrC, SiC, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, CeO2, etc, is used to improve their tribological performance 

[29-33]. In conclusion, this wide range of compositions makes these alloys very versatile, 

allowing to achieve the desired properties for a particular application.  

Ceramic coatings have been extensively applied in components submitted to extremely 

high temperature conditions due to their superior properties when compared to metallic 

coatings [24-36]. However, their use as thick coatings in the protection of parts for the glass 

industry is limited due to their extremely low thermal conductivity. This is a fundamental 

parameter for the productivity, which can determine the selection and the applicability of any 

solution in glass molds. As it will be referred later, the applicability of ceramic materials can 

only be envisaged if this shortcoming is overcome. In order to take advantage of the excellent 

high temperature properties of ceramic materials, the only solution is to deposit them in the 

form of thin films. An emergent deposition process able to satisfy this requirement is the PVD 

technique. 

Independently of the base material and the coatings on it applied, the failures in the 

molds during service depend on a high number of factors, loading conditions and functional 



Chapter II - Historical Perspective 

13 
Filipe Daniel Fernandes 

requirements. Whenever a failure occurs, the most important factor is not the cost of the 

component but the costs due to machine down time, process instability and poor production. 

Therefore a proper design and fabrication procedure of the molds, as well as their appropriate 

use in service, should be carefully analyzed. The factors that lead to the molds failure are the 

thermal and mechanical strains, the wear plastic deformation, the thermal fatigue and the 

action of the oxidative, abrasive and corrosive environments occurring in service conditions 

[37-39]. The synergetic effect of the harsh conditions with a faulty design, a defective 

material or bad working practices is the perfect combination to induce the premature failure of 

components, expressed as: worn-out geometries, plastic deformation, surface and bulk 

material cracks, breakdown of the coatings. For example, the presence of sharp corners, 

notches and sudden changes in the cross section should be avoided in molds design. They act 

as hot spots which potentiate the failure by thermal fatigue, wear and cracking due to the high 

temperature there reached [38, 40, 41]. With the components of molds being constantly 

heated and cooled down during glass containers production, large thermal gradients are 

created causing the mold tension during heating and compression during cooling down [37, 

42]. Thus, surface cracks are frequently produced resulting in a poor product surface 

finishing. Moreover, if the thermal expansion coefficients of the base materials and the 

coatings are very different, cracks can appear on either base material, base material/coating 

interface or, even, only in the coating, leading also to the mold failure. Thermal shock is also 

reported as a cause for premature mold failure [37, 38]. In conclusion, the increase of molds 

lifetime, the improvement in glass containers quality, the decrease in the rejection rate and the 

reduction of costs production can only be achieved through a convenient selection of new 

materials (substrate and coatings), the optimization of molds geometries, application of 

innovative processes of deposition and adoption of new working practices. 

As it was referred to in Chapter I, the main processes used to apply coatings to protect 

the mold surfaces in glass industry, are: (i) hardfacing processes such as Plasma Transferred 

Arc (PTA) or Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW), and (ii) thermal spraying processes such 

as Flame Spraying (FS) and High Velocity Oxy Fuel (HVOF). Ones more than the others, in 

general, these processes often lead to problems of adhesion of the coating to the substrate, 

high rate of porosity (5-15%), high residual stresses, excess of dilution with the consequent 

changes in microstructural and functional properties of the coatings and base materials, in all 

cases compromising the performance of the molds and the final quality of the produced parts 

[43-47]. FS is the oldest process used for depositing coatings on molds for the glass industry, 

since it is simple, easy to be applied and of low cost when compared with other deposition 



Chapter II - Historical Perspective 

14 
Filipe Daniel Fernandes 

methods. However, the adhesion of the coating to the substrate is very low and it presents a 

high level of porosity, which frequently reduces significantly the life time of the molds in 

service [9]. To avoid adhesion problems, hardfacing processes have been preferentially used 

(GTAW and PTA), since they promote a strong metallurgical bond between the coating and 

substrate, condition required to avoid their catastrophic failure in service. This technique 

gives rise to much better results than thermal spraying processes, for which the adhesion is 

only due to a mechanical bonding. GTAW process deposits thicker coatings with lower 

porosity and high production rates than flame spraying [48]. However, it is generally 

restricted to flat or horizontal surfaces. On the other hand, PTA process produces better 

results than GTAW in terms of efficiency and quality of the coatings, at a lower cost. It is a 

very versatile process allowing depositing any kind of material, with lower porosity at a 

higher production rate than FS and GTAW [49-52]. This process assures a deep penetration of 

the coating material into the bulk substrate with a narrow heat affected zone and a relatively 

small weld bead due to its high velocity plasma jet when compared to GTAW. However, it is 

not portable and cannot be used to coat complex forms, being its main disadvantages. 

Presently, PTA is being increasingly used in components for glass industry, mainly on the 

mold edges, zone submitted to a high abrasion by the hot plasticized glass. Furthermore, 

despite the good adhesion promoted by the hardfacing processes due to the formation of a 

metallurgical bond, in some cases this can be a disadvantage. In fact, to reach high adhesion 

values it is frequently necessary to increase the level of dilution of the base material with the 

coating. Such a procedure leads to changes in the chemical composition of the deposited filler 

metal, which can compromise the properties of the coatings and their performance in service. 

Hence, a proper selection of the deposition parameters should be carefully done to accomplish 

the commitment between the requirements of mechanical strength, corrosion/oxidation 

resistance and adhesion [44]. Normally, coatings with thickness in the range of 2 - 5 mm are 

applied in the molds surfaces with these processes.  

HVOF process provides coatings with higher hardness than PTA do, since it allows 

higher cooling rates which promote refined microstructures [9, 53, 54]. Furthermore, owing to 

the high energy of the particles jet, better mechanical interlocking can be achieved with the 

consequent increase of the bond strength of the coatings to the substrate in relation to FS 

process; however, it continues significantly lower than that of the hardfacing processes [55]. 

As this process is based on the spraying of powders in the melted state over a cooled 

substrate, the heat affected zone of the base material remains very low, avoiding the formation 

of brittle phases resulting from the metallurgical melting process occurring frequently in 



Chapter II - Historical Perspective 

15 
Filipe Daniel Fernandes 

hardfacing processes, which lead very often to failure problems by cracking. The main 

disadvantage of this process is the need of fusion of the coating after deposition, since the 

rapid cooling down of the powders from the melted state does not allow a good intermixing 

among them and a “poor” cohesion of the particles is normally achieved. HVOF allows to 

deposit uniform coatings (without dilution) keeping heat extraction conditions uniform in the 

entire molds surface, which is a required condition to evenly cool down the glass containers 

and, therefore, to produce glass parts without defects. HVOF is being used to coat critical 

components in the glass industry, for example the plungers shown on the right in Figure 2.1, 

where an efficient and uniform heat transfer is required [2, 3, 8]. The typical thickness of the 

coatings for molds surface protection is in the range of 100 - 500 µm. A summary of the main 

and typical characteristics of thermal spraying and hardfacing processes is shown in Table 

2.1.

Recently, other deposition techniques, such as Atmospheric Plasma Spraying (APS) 

and Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD), have emerged, showing a promising potential for 

application in glass industry. APS process is a thermal spraying process very similar to HVOF 

since both are based on the projection of melted powders towards the substrate [61, 62]. 

However, whilst in HVOF process the material in the form of powder is heated based on the 

generation of a hot flame obtained by combustion of gases, in APS process melting is 

promoted by the powder injection into a very high temperature plasma generated by a 

discharge, where it is rapidly heated and accelerated. The main advantage of the APS process 

is the much higher temperatures that can be reached in the plasma, making it suitable to 

deposited materials of high melting points, as it is the case of cermets and ceramics [59]. In 

HVOF the temperature reached is around 4000 ºC and the particle velocity 2000 m/s, while in 

plasma spraying the temperature reaches 20000 ºC and the velocity 400 m/s. However, the 

very high temperatures and lower velocity occurring in the APS process results in coatings 

with microstructures containing oxides, nitrides and, also, some porosity as well as lower 



Chapter II - Historical Perspective 

16 
Filipe Daniel Fernandes 

adhesion to the substrate. Despite these disadvantages, APS deposition of cermet and ceramic 

coatings was shown in some cases to lead to much better properties than when they are 

deposited by HVOF [59]. Thus, the use of the APS process to deposit either the previous 

referred cermet coatings (Ni-based alloys reinforced with stable carbides and oxides), which 

are normally used to improve the wear behavior, or new cermet coating systems, should be 

taken into account. In spite of the extremely high number of studies regarding the effect of 

carbide and oxide additions on the tribological behavior of Ni-based alloys, no reports have 

been published regarding the effect of nanostructured zirconia additions on their properties. 

Presently, pure tetragonal zirconia coatings are one of the main materials used on the turbine 

blades surface protection due to their extremely high performance at high temperature [63-

66]. As in glass industry, such material cannot be used as pure coating to protect the mold 

surfaces due to its very lower thermal conductivity; however, owing to its high level of 

hardness, wear and oxidation resistance, its use as reinforcement material in Ni-based alloy 

coatings should be considered. 

PVD is a process of deposition of thin films (thickness in the range from few to 

thousands nanometers) that produces coatings with outstanding mechanical properties. It is 

common in this process, depending on the coating system, to deposit films with two to four 

times better mechanical properties than those of the thick coatings described above. The 

application of this technique to protect molds for the glass industry is still embryonic, since 

their much smaller thickness seems, at industrial eyes, unpromising and unattractive when 

compared to that of thick coatings. However, in other industries, where parts are submitted to 

extreme high temperature and mechanical loading conditions, these coatings have shown to 

successfully increase the life-time and performance of the coated parts, in some cases in more 

than one or two orders of magnitude [67-73], allowing predict a potential use of these films to 

protect glass molds surfaces. From the development point of view, this technique has been 

shown to be very versatile. It easily allows scan the chemical composition of a coatings 

system, containing one or more elements, permitting the optimization of the deposition of a 

specific film, i.e. the coating with the best compromise between e.g. mechanical, tribological, 

oxidation and corrosion properties. Moreover, it allows overcoming the problems of using 

ceramic coatings in molds protection. In fact, the lower thermal conductivity of the ceramics 

materials can be avoided if the thickness of the non-thermal conductive film is very low. The 

main disadvantages of this process are its high investment and production costs, although in 

some cases the latter can be decreased. In fact, using PVD process some steps of the molds 

production can be removed (for example post-deposition machining tasks, see Table 2.2 for 



Chapter II - Historical Perspective

more detail) and, depending on the mold dimensions, several parts can be coated at the same 

time. Therefore, sometimes the final cost of molds production can reach values similar to 

those achieved with thick films processes. Finally, it should be taken into account the costs of 

glass containers production. On the one hand, the much better properties of thin films in 

comparison to thicker ones, may envisage an extended lifetime of the components and 

therefore, even if the cost of mold surface protection is higher, the final production costs can 

decrease. On the other hand, due to the very low thickness, the possibility of an increased heat 

extraction, during glass forming process, gives rise to either important savings in energy, 

decrease of the production times or improvement of the final quality of the produced parts.

In the last decades, the development of thin coatings for mechanical applications was 

concentrated in solutions that could ensure simultaneously the specifications required for a 

longer lifetime and an increased productivity, high hardness and high toughness, associated 

with high thermal resistance, which should accomplish the desired excellent tribological 

behavior at high temperatures. The first generation of hard coatings was concentrated in 

single carbides, nitrides and oxides (e.g. TiN, WN, TiC, AlN, WC, Al2O3) [67, 74-76]. The 

following generations comprised the mixed compounds, such as TiCN, WCN, (TiAl)N, 

TiSiN, etc. [77-81] and the multilayer and multiphase structures (TiN/NbN, TiN/AlN, TiN/W, 

WN/Ti, TiSiN, TiBN) [80, 82-84]. Finally, super hard coatings were developed as for 

example, c-BN, c-B4C, etc [85, 86]. In all these cases, the extension of the lifetime and 

performance of the coated components was successfully achieved.  

The development process of hard coatings based on transition metal nitrides started 

with single nitrides, such as TiN and CrN, which have been widely used as protective

coatings [87-90]. However, the need for using these coatings in more severe and demanding 

environments (particularly, at high temperature applications) led to their alloying with 

chemical elements that could in anyway improve their thermal behavior; here multi-element 

nitride films appeared [91, 92]. The most known of these is TiAlN, which has higher 

mechanical strength and oxidation resistance than TiN [93, 94]. The entire range of Ti/Al 

ratios was scanned and, globally, the use of very high Al/Ti ratio gives rise to a significant 

improvement of the oxidation resistance at high temperatures [95, 96]. With the same aim, 

improvement of the oxidation resistance, the addition of Cr to TiN film has also been 

extensively studied [92, 97, 98]. Cr was better in some situations, Al or Si were in others. 

Therefore, development of quaternary (e.g. TiAlCrN, TiAlSiN, CrAlSiN) and higher (e.g. 

TiAlCrSiN) systems, was performed by the incorporation of other elements such as Si, B, Cr, 

Al [71, 99, 100]. Among the ternary coatings, TiSiN was one of the most extensively studied 

[101, 102]. Depending on the deposition conditions, these coatings have been reported 

consisting of: i) nano-sized TiN crystallites surrounded by a Si-N amorphous matrix [103-

105], or ii) substitutional solid solution of Si in TiN structure (not predicted by the Ti-Si-N 

phase diagram) [103, 106, 107]. Their main advantage in relation to previous ternary coatings 

is the much higher hardness values that can be achieved, between 40 and 50 GPa, for the same 

level of oxidation resistance, particularly if a nanocomposite structure is deposited [95, 103, 

108]. 

Currently, during glass containers production, liquid lubricants are used to avoid the 

adhesion between the molds surface and the melted glass. In service, most of the lubricant is 

volatilized, due to the high temperatures, promoting the glass adhesion to the surface and, 

thus, accelerating the wear of the component and giving rise to poor quality in the produced 

parts. Furthermore, these lubricants contain commonly small amounts of sulfur which, 

combined to oxygen, forms sulfuric acid that erodes the mold surfaces creating holes and 

leading to the premature failure of the mold. Thus, the use on mold surfaces of solid 

lubricants, instead of the liquid ones, is of great interest, since their low vapor pressure and, 

hence, sublimation does not occur so easily. A wide range of solid lubricant coatings have 

been developed in the last decades and successfully applied in tribological components. Solid 

lubricant coatings such as WC/C, MoS2, diamond-like carbon (DLC), hex-BN, etc, as well as 

their combination in nanocrystalline or multilayer structures, are some examples [70, 109, 

110]. However, considerable degradation of the tribological effectiveness of these coatings at 

high temperature has been reported due to their low oxidation resistance. To overcome this 

shortcoming, new concepts of lubrication have been proposed. Solid lubricants for high

temperature applications can be divided into three categories [111-113]: (i) soft metals (e.g. 

Ag, Cu, Au, Pb, and In); (ii) fluorides (e.g. CaF2, BaF2, and CeF3); and, (iii) metal oxides (e.g. 

V2O5, Ag2Mo2O7). These coatings were developed by combining the intrinsic properties of 

some binary or ternary coatings, that are resistant to oxidation, with specific elements in order 

to get the lubricious properties.  

All the above three types of solid lubricants materials plastically deform and/or form 

low-shear-strength surfaces at elevated temperatures, characteristics responsible for the 

lubricious effect. Among them, special attention has been given to the coatings based on the 

formation of lubricious oxides, being vanadium the preferred element, reason why particular 

attention has been given to the vanadium-containing coatings with the expectation of 

formation of Magnéli phases VnO3n?1. These coatings showed interesting tribological 

properties in the temperature range 500 – 700 ºC [70, 114-119]. Various series of V rich 

coatings have been developed, such as ternary (V,Ti)N [120], CrVN multilayered AlN/VN 

[121] and quaternary single layer or multilayered CrAlVN [122, 123] and TiAlVN [116, 124-

126]. A detailed description of the effect of V additions on the mechanical, tribological and 

oxidation, properties of these coatings can be found in a recent paper review published by 

Franz et. al [127]. In summary, the most important conclusions of these studies are: (i) the 

relative amounts of V2O5 detected at the oxidized surface of V rich films successfully 

decreases the wear rate and friction coefficient of the coatings; (ii) a strong out-diffusion of V 

significantly degrades the oxidation resistance of the coatings; (iii) the out-diffusion only 

permits a short time efficiency of solid lubrication with the V-oxides.  

The control of the V out-diffusion is now one of the major challenges to reach an 

adequate oxidation resistance and suitable tribological properties without compromising the 

original properties of the host binary and ternary films. One of the possible proposals to solve 

this problem will be to use coatings systems composed by a dual phase, in which one of the 

phases act as a diffusion barrier to vanadium. This can be the case of TiSiN system. If 

deposited as a nanocomposite structure (nano-sized TiN crystallites surrounded by an 

amorphous matrix of Si3N4), the Si-N phase may work as an anti-diffusion barrier [128] and, 

therefore, if V is incorporated in solid solution in the lattice of the TiN grains, the controlled 

release of V can be achieved. By tailoring the nanostructure of the Ti-Si-N films, i.e 

producing coatings with different Si-N layer thickness, the V out-diffusion can be controlled 

as well as its release as oxide in the coatings surface. An alternative method would be to 

deposit a multilayer structure with Si-N layers of increasing thicknesses from the top to the 

bottom of the coating.

Ni-based coatings deposited by PTA process 

3.1. Introduction 

This chapter is dedicated to the analysis of the effect of the arc current variation on the 

microstructure, hardness, oxidation performance, structural and morphology evolution after 

annealing and tribological behavior of Ni-based coatings deposited by PTA process, and is 

supported by the publications presented in the Annexes A to E. 

The effect of the PTA current variation on the microstructure and hardness of the 

coatings is presented in annex A. The microstructural changes in the coatings as well as in the 

respective heat affected zones were analyzed in this paper. Further, the effect of a post-weld 

heat treatment (PWHT) on the microstructure and hardness of the coatings and base material 

was also examined as well as their wear performance evaluated in micro-scale abrasion. This 

method was selected to reproduce the main wear mechanism (3 body abrasion) identified in 

the surface of molds which have been in service for long time, although it does not allow 

consider the high temperature effect. An exhaustive investigation of the test conditions that 

produce such kind of wear mechanism was carried out and it is detailed in the paper of Annex 

D. The wear resistance of the coatings, in particular their abrasion resistance was evaluated 

before and after annealing in order to understand the effect of temperature on the wear

performance of the coatings (publication in Annex C). The influence of the heat treatment on 

the hardness and microstructure of the coatings was also discussed. The high temperature 

tribological behavior of the coatings was assessed in a pin-on-disc tribometer (publication in 

Annex E). Besides the effect of the increasing dilution on the wear behavior of the coatings at 

room and increasing temperatures, the base material used in the molds production (gray cast 

iron) was also investigated. The publication in Annex B is dedicated to the study of the effect 

of substrate dilution on the oxidation behavior of coatings. The oxidation mechanisms 

occurring during coatings heat treatment were also discussed in this paper. 

The experimental procedure and conditions adopted for the coatings deposition and 

characterization are described in detail for each specific investigation on the papers of the 

annexes. In the following sections, the main results achieved are summarized. 

3.2. Microstructure and hardness of the coatings 

Ni-based coatings were deposited by PTA process, using the same process parameters 

with exception of the arc current, on flat surfaces of gray cast iron blocks in order to study the 

effect of substrate dilution on their properties. The following arc currents were used: 100 A 

for specimen 1, 128 A for specimen 2 and 140 A for specimen 4. Further, the edges of a block 

with a machined U-shaped groove were coated with the same parameters of specimen 2 

(specimen 3).  

The effect of the arc current variation on the dilution of the coatings is shown on the 

macrographs displayed in Figure 3.1. With the arc current increase in the range 100 - 140 A, 

the dilution steadily increased from 28% to 59%. Both flat and U-shaped groove machined 

specimens revealed to have similar dilution and macrostructures suggesting that the 

deposition conditions on flat surfaces blocks could be extrapolated to molds. As it would be 

expected, the increasing dilution had a significant influence on the chemical composition of 

the coatings, being the main changes related to the decrease of the Ni content and the increase 

of Fe, Si, C and Mo contents, in good agreement with the chemical composition of the base 

material.

Figure 3.1 - Dilution induced by PTA process using different weldments: specimen 1 - 100 A, specimen 2 and 3 

- 128A, specimen 4 – 140 A. 

After deposition, four distinct regions could be observed on the cross section of the 

coatings, as follows: the fusion zone (FZ), which corresponds to the coating material (the 

nickel alloy), the partially melted zone (PMZ), which is the area close to the FZ where 

liquation can occur during weld, the heat affected zone (HAZ), which is not melted but 

undergoes microstructural changes, and the base material (BM) which structure remains 

unaffected by the deposition process. In all the cases the fusion zone showed a dense 

microstructure, free of microcracks and few solidification voids. Increasing substrate dilution 

was shown to reduce the content of porosity in the coatings, correlated with the refinement of 

the dendritic microstructure (Figure 3.2). The microstructure consisted of dendrites of a Ni-Fe 

solid solution phase aligned along the direction of the heat flow. Furthermore, torturous grain 

boundaries were displayed, with C flakes (dark-floret structures) evenly distributed in the 

matrix. The large number of C flakes on the microstructure was attributed to the dilution of 

the base material. Moreover, the dendritic structure became finer as the arc current and, 

therefore, dilution increased. 

For higher arc currents the heat input during deposition increased, being expected a 

coarsened microstructure; however, an opposite behavior was witnessed. According to the 

WDS maps (wavelength dispersion spectroscopy) of the most abundant elements of the 

coatings, the refinement of the dendritic structure was attributed to the higher number of 

precipitates and C-flakes in the grain boundaries, due to substrate dilution. In fact, these 

phases normally segregate in the grain boundaries, which increased the rate of heterogeneous 

transformation during solidification, hindering the grain growth. A detailed analysis in the 

elements distribution with increasing dilution can be confirmed in Annex A.  

According to X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-deposited coatings, the major phases 

of their structure were primarily (Ni, Fe) face centered cubic solid solution, with the 

occurrence of N3Si, Cr5B3 and Fe3Mo3C phases. This phase distribution was in good 

agreement with the elemental maps distribution drawn for the coatings. Moreover, according

to WDS analysis, other precipitates such as C-B, and Mo-C were also observed in the grain 

boundaries, contributing to the microstructure refinement, although they were not detected by 

XRD analysis, probably due to their small size and/or content. Close to the interface 

coating/base material, a cellular microstructure, finer than the dendritic structure, was 

observed for all the specimens (see Figure 3.2 d) for specimen 1). This refinement may be 

attributed to the high solidification rates involved owing to the efficient thermal exchange 

ensured by the high volume ratio substrate/coating. 

 

 

Figure 3.2 - Optical micrographs of: a) specimen 1, b) specimen 2, c) specimen 4, d) interface of specimen 1. 

Despite the previous refinement of the coating microstructure with increasing dilution, 

which would suggest an increase of the hardness, an opposite trend was registered, i.e. the 

hardness of coatings decreased with increasing arc current, as it is shown in Figure 3.3. This 

behavior is undesirable in terms of wear resistance and could only be explained by the 

changes in the chemical composition reported above. In all the cases the hardness throughout 

the melted material revealed to be approximately constant.  

The highest hardness value was observed close to the interface coating/fusion zone, 

more specifically on the PMZ (538 HV0.5 for specimen 1), being lower with increasing arc 

current, which may be favorable in terms of the toughness of that region. This zone has been

found to be formed by hard cementite and martensite phases which are usually responsible for 

the brittle behavior of Fe-C alloys. The hardness of the HAZ was significantly higher than the 

base material but lower than the PMZ material, as a consequence of the presence of 

martensite and the absence of cementite. The proportion of martensite in the microstructure 

decreased with increasing distance from the fusion line and, thus, the hardness dropped down 

too. 

The microstructure of heat-affected zones and the induced mechanical properties were 

directly related to the heat input and, therefore, to the current intensity. The high hardness 

values found in the PMZ and HAZ made these regions potentially responsible for many of the 

mechanical problems occurring in cast iron welds since they were brittle. Thus, a post-weld 

heat treatment (PWHT) at 850 ºC for 1h was performed to the specimens in order to reduce 

the presence of brittle phases. As can be observed in Figure 3.4 for specimen 4, the heat 

treatment successfully reduced the hardness of the PMZ and HAZ zones down to the base 

material values without significant changes of the coating hardness. In this case, PMZ, HAZ 

and BM zones were formed basically by a perlitic/ferritic structure, justifying the large scatter 

of hardness measurements, as shown in Figure 3.4.

3.3. Oxidation resistance and diffusion mechanisms 

Two of the previous coatings (specimens 1 and 3) were held at 800 ºC and 900 ºC in 

air atmosphere during 2 h in a thermogravimetric equipment (TGA), in order to study the 

influence of the substrate dilution on the oxidation resistance of the coatings. The surface, as 

well as the cross-section, of the oxidized coatings were observed by scanning electron 

microscopy (SEM) and analyzed with both energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and 

XRD diffraction. The results are fully presented in Annex B; specimens 1 and 3 were termed 

as coatings C100 and C128, respectively. The thermogravimetric analysis revealed that 

increasing the substrate dilution the oxidation resistance of coatings decreased, as shown in 

Figure 3.5. This behavior was correlated to the chemical composition changes occurred due to 

dilution; in particular due to the high iron content introduced in the coating. As a 

consequence, different oxide phases were detected in the two coatings, although in each 

coating the phases indexed after thermal exposure at 800 and 900 ºC were similar. According 

to XRD and SEM-EDS analyses performed at the oxidized surface of the coatings, the oxide 

phase sets detected at 800 ºC and 900 ºC were: (i) B2O3, SiO2, Cr5B3 and OAlB for coatings 

produced with lower dilution and (ii) Fe2O3 (hematite), Fe3O4 (magnetite), spinels of 

NiFe2O4, and small amounts of NiO, B2O3 and B6O for higher dilution coatings. In the latter, 

carbon particles were also detected.

Moreover, the analysis performed on the cross section of coatings showed different 

types of oxide layers after isothermal oxidation. In the coating with lower dilution the oxide 

scale showed to be mainly formed by a protective thick layer of Si-O in which small amounts 

of a phase rich in Ni, Si, Al and B (Si-O, Ni-Si and Al-B-O phases) were uniformly 

distributed. On the top a B rich oxide was detected too. On the other hand, a dual layer 

structure was formed in the case of the coating with high dilution: an external layer of Fe2O3, 

with small features of Fe3O4 and NiFe2O4 spinel rich phases, and an internal Fe3O4 layer with 

small amounts of an evenly distributed dark phase rich in silicon, nickel and iron. Similar to 

specimen 1, small amounts of B-O were also detected on the top. Furthermore, between the

outer and inner layers, a very thin Si-O layer was also identified. Thermogravimetric curves 

showed that the coating with lower dilution displayed a parabolic oxidation weight gain as a 

function of the time, typical indicating an oxide growth controlled by a protective Si-O layer. 

The coating with higher dilution followed the same trend at 800 ºC; however, at 900 
0
C two 

stages in the oxidation curve were detected, the first with a linear increase in mass gain, has 

been shown to be a compromise between the outward Fe diffusion through a growing layer of 

Fe2O3 and the loss of carbon by decarburization and formation of CO2. The second step 

obeyed a parabolic law starting at the moment that the oxide scale, above described, thickened 

to a critical value impedding the C liberation, leaving the ion diffusion through the scale the 

only mechanism controlling the mass gain. A detailed description of the oxidation resistance 

and the diffusion mechanisms occurring with these coatings can be found in Annex B. 

3.4. Tribological behavior 

The influence of substrate dilution on the tribological performance of coatings was 

investigated using two different wear equipments: micro-scale abrasion and pin-on-disc 

apparatuses. The first equipment was used since it is among wear tests one of the simplest to 

reproduce the wear mechanism closest to what is occurring on the surface of molds in contact 

with melted glass (3 body abrasion). However this equipment did not allow high temperature 

testing. Therefore, the high temperature tribological behavior of the coatings was assessed in 

another tribometer (pin-on-disk), although it did not allow reproducing so well the interaction 

conditions between melted glass and the surface of molds. 

3.4.1. Micro-scale abrasion tests 

In order to use micro-scale abrasion tests to evaluate the effect of substrate dilution on 

the abrasive wear resistance of the coatings, an exhaustive investigation of the test conditions 

(different abrasive concentrations, loads and sliding distances) that produces 3 body abrasion 

wear mechanism was carried out and detailed in Annex D. It was observed that low loads and 

higher fraction of abrasive slurry enable 3-body abrasion, whilst, 2-body abrasion becomes 

stable at high loads and low volume fraction of abrasive slurry. Moreover, it was perceived 

that the specific wear rate essentially depends on the wear rate mechanisms (rolling or 

grooving) involved and not on the test conditions employed, since these do not produce 

changes in the wear mechanism; i.e. different test conditions which produce similar wear 

mechanism can be used to calculate the specific wear rate of coatings. The influence of the 



Chapter III – Effect of the arc current variation on the properties of Ni-based coatings deposited by PTA process

Filipe Daniel Fernandes 

substrate dilution on the micro-abrasion resistance of Ni-based coatings was evaluated in 

Annex A and Annex C, using a combination of test conditions that would produce 3-body 

abrasion wear mechanism. In both cases the wear results showed that dilution slight decreased 

the wear rate of the coatings (see Figure 3.6), in good agreement with the decrease in their 

hardness. However, due to the high concentration of abrasive slurry used (103 g per 1×10
-4

 m
3
 

in Annex C against 34 g per 1×10
-4

 m
3
 in Annex A), and owing to the different ball surface 

preparation done in Annex C, the wear rate of the specimens revealed to be one order of 

magnitude higher. In addition, the wear scars promoted by the tests revealed the presence of 

two different wear mechanisms (3-body and 2-body abrasion), although 3-body abrasion was 

predominant. Therefore, although a pure 3-body wear mechanism was not produced, as it 

would be expected by the results of Annex D, the tests allowed closely reproduced the wear 

mechanism present on the molds surface although the high temperature effect had not been 

considered. 

The heat treatment performed at specimen 4 (at 500 ºC) during 5 and 10 days revealed 

not promote changes in their specific wear rate of coatings. However, sample exposed during 

20 days exhibited a lower specific wear rate (see Figure 3.6). This was attributed to the 

increasing of coating hardness with thermal exposure, due to the precipitation of a Ni-P phase 

in the coating matrix. A detailed description on the influence of the annealing treatment on the 

properties of coatings can be seen in Annex C.

3.4.2. Pin-on-disc tests 

Several weld beads of specimen 1 and 4 (different dilutions – 28 and 59%, 

respectively) were deposited in parallel on the flat surface of cast iron blocks, ensuring some 

overlapping between them in order to produce coatings large enough to allow perform 

tribological tests. The tribological performance of the coatings was evaluated at three different 

temperatures: room temperature, 550 and 700 ºC, and compared to the uncoated gray cast 

iron. Although in the real working conditions of molds glass acts as an abrasive material, due 

to its melted state at high temperature, for the tribological tests we have selected as 

counterpart a harder and more resistant material: Al2O3 balls. All the wear tests were 

conducted at a constant linear speed of 0.10 m.s
-1

, a load of 5 N, a relative humidity of 

48±5%, and 5000 cycles. The radius of the wear tracks was set to 5.3 mm.  

The tribological tests revealed that at room temperature, the wear rate of the coatings 

was independent of the substrate dilution and similar to the gray cast iron (see Figure 3.7). In 

all coatings the wear was governed by tribo-oxidation. Similar friction values were measured 

in all coatings which were understood by the similar wear debris detected on the worn surface 

of the coatings, despite of their discrepancy in hardness and chemical composition due to the 

different dilution. Gray cast iron showed a similar level of wear rate as Ni coatings at RT in 

spite of its lower hardness (2 times lower than the Ni coatings). This was explained by the 

presence of graphite on the worn surface, which acting as a solid lubricant led to lower 

friction coefficient and compensated a possible higher wear rate due to the lower hardness.  

The wear rate of the coatings abruptly increased when tested at 550 ºC; however, it 

dropped with further increase to 700 ºC. Globally, specimen 1 displayed much higher wear 

rate than specimen 4 at high temperatures, result that could be interpreted on the basis of the 

oxidation resistance of coatings. At 550 ºC, due to the lower oxidation resistance of the 

specimen 4, a continuous oxide tribo-layer was formed on their worn surface, protecting it 

against wear. In case of specimen 1, due to its higher resistance to oxidation, the oxidation 

rate is reduced. Due to the movement of the ball, the destruction of the growing oxide layer is 

relatively easier, hindering the formation of a stable oxide layer over the surface and, thus, 

leading to high wear volumes due to the direct contact between the alumina ball and the virgin 

coating. At 700 ºC, the wear rate of both coatings is reduced due to the formation of 

continuous and thick oxide-layers on the worn surfaces. This was not the trend for gray cast 

iron for which a monotonous increase of the wear rate with increasing temperature was 

observed. In this case, the very low oxidation resistance of the material allowed an easy

removal of the tribo-layer and the depletion of graphite from the wear track. This tribological 

behavior is presented and discussed in detail in Annex E.  

 

  

Figure 3.7 - Variation of the wear rate of the as deposited PTA coatings and the gray cast iron with testing 

temperature. 

In conclusion, the increase in the arc current, and therefore in the dilution of the 

substrate, has detrimental effect on the hardness, oxidation resistance and tribological 

behavior of the coatings at room temperature. However, beneficial effect on the high 

temperature tribological behavior was observed due to the fast formation of oxide layers 

which protect the coating surface against wear. Therefore, the dilution degree should be 

optimized in order to get the best compromise between the level of oxidation, wear resistance, 

mechanical properties and adhesion to make possible to achieve coatings with the best 

performance.

Chapter IV 

4. Influence of nanostructured ZrO2 additions on the wear 

resistance of Ni-based alloy coatings deposited by APS 

4.1. Introduction 

This chapter is dedicated to the study of the effect of nanostructured ZrO2 additions on 

the microstructure, micro-hardness and wear performance of Ni-based alloy coatings, 

deposited by atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) on a low carbon steel, and is supported by 

the paper presented in Annex F.  

The coatings with nanostructured ZrO2 additions were produced by either powders of 

Ni-based alloy and nanostructured zirconia mixed by mechanical alloying or separate powders 

using a dual powder injection system available at the APS equipment. In both cases, two 

contents of nanostructured zirconia were added to the Ni-based alloy: 20% and 40% in 

volume. All the properties of the coatings were compared, interpreted and discussed in 

relation to either unalloyed nickel or nanostructured zirconia coatings and based on the 

deposition parameters. The coatings produced with powders prepared by mechanical alloying 

using 20% and 40 % of nanostructured ZrO2 were denominated as “Ni+20% MA” and 

“Ni+40% MA”, respectively, and the coatings deposited using the dual system of powder 

injection with 20% and 40 % of nanostructured ZrO2 were designated as “Ni+20% Dual” and 

“Ni+40% Dual”, respectively.

4.2. Microstructure and hardness of the coatings 

All the coatings showed a typical morphology of plasma sprayed materials, with pores, 

lamellae, and partially/un-melted particles (see Figure 4.1). Ni pure coating displayed a 

compact and homogeneous microstructure (Figure 4.1 a)), while pure ZrO2 coating showed an 

extremely high level of porosity with some cracks, resulting from the tensile residual stresses 

generated during cooling down to room temperature (Figure 4.1 b)). Ni+ZrO2 MA coatings 

displayed a homogeneous and compact microstructure, with small zirconia particles evenly 

distributed in the matrix, whilst Ni+ZrO2 Dual coatings exhibited a porous microstructure, full 

of semi-melted Ni powders with large particles of ZrO2 entrapped in their boundaries 

suggesting a brittle behavior. Nanostructured zirconia additions progressively increased the 

hardness of the coatings. However, coatings deposited using powders prepared by mechanical 

alloying displayed much higher hardness than Dual coatings (7.0 - 7.6 against 5.4 - 5.9 GPa, 

respectively). This was in good agreement with their lower porosity, higher level of 

compactness and finer and more homogeneous distribution of the nanostructured zirconia. In 

relation to the structure, the main phases detected corresponded to the ones identified in both 

pure Ni-based and ZrO2 coatings, i.e: Ni, Ni-Cr-Fe, Cr23C6, Cr5B3 and ZrO2.

4.3. Tribological behavior 

The influence of the nanostructured zirconia addition on the wear behavior of a Ni-

based coating was studied using reciprocating tribological testing equipment with a ball-on-

plate configuration. A harmonic wave generated by an eccentric and rod mechanism imposed 

a stroke length of 2.05 mm at a frequency of 1 Hz. A soda-lime glass sphere of 10 mm in 

diameter was used as counterpart, as the most suitable material to study the interaction of 

glass with the coatings. All the tests were conducted at room temperature during two hours.

Four different values of normal load were applied to the coated samples and the volume loss, 

specific wear rate and friction coefficient were evaluated.  

ZrO2 incorporation successfully decreased the specific wear rate and the friction 

coefficient of the Ni-based coating, independently of the deposition procedure adopted (see 

Figure 4.2). However, this trend is more accentuated in Ni+ZrO2 MA than in Ni+ZrO2 Dual 

coatings. Furthermore, increasing ZrO2 content in MA coatings has a decreasing monotonous 

effect on the wear rate whereas an inverse trend was observed in Dual coatings for the highest 

ZrO2 content. Several factors, such as the hardness, the microstructure and the wear 

mechanisms occurring during sliding, were used to interpret those different trends in the 

specific wear rates of coatings, as follows: 

(i) Ni+ZrO2 MA coatings showed clean wear tracks with longitudinal scratches 

identifying grooving abrasion. Thus, the uniform distribution of small ZrO2 particles, 

combined with the higher hardness and toughness of these coatings, impeded the liberation of 

large wear debris from the coatings, their plastic deformation and adhesion, leading to low 

specific wear rate.  

(ii) In the case of Dual coatings, the main wear mechanism observed on the worn 

surfaces was of adhesion type, as for pure Ni coating, due to the large areas of nickel exposed 

to the counterpart. The semi-melted state of Ni powders, the high level of porosity and the 

agglomeration of ZrO2 particles located in-between Ni-based lamellae, made the coatings less 

tough, inducing an increase of their wear rate.  

(iii) The increase of nanostructured zirconia from 20 to 40% in Dual coatings, 

promoted higher levels of brittleness in the Ni lamellae boundaries, increasing the volume 

loss of the material.  

(iv) Pure ZrO2 coating displayed the highest specific wear rate among all the coatings, 

due to its brittle behavior.

Figure 4.2 - Specific wear rate of coatings calculated from the reciprocating tribological tests. 

The influence of nanostructure zirconia additions on the abrasion resistance of a Ni-

based coating was also studied. The tests were performed at the most promising coatings (MA 

coatings) using the same test conditions as for Ni-based coatings in Annex A, with the 

exception of the sliding distances, which were adapted based on the wear mechanism. In fact 

for these tests conditions (AISI 52100 steel ball bearing with 25.4 mm in diameter rotating at 

a speed of 75 rpm under a load of 0.1 N and an proportion of abrasive slurry of 28% (34 g per 

1×10
-4

 m
3
 of silica in water)), sliding distances higher than 400 turns showed produce a 

mixed-mode wear mechanism (3-body plus 2-body abrasion). Thus, in order to ensure 3-body 

abrasion formation the experiments were performed using lower test durations (50, 80, 150, 

200 and 300 rpm). The volume loss plotted as a function of the “load × sliding distance” 

parameter is plotted in Figure 4.3 and the respective specific wear rate, calculated from the 

slope of a straight line fitted to these points, is shown in Figure 4.4. In all cases the main wear 

mechanism observed on the wear track was three-body abrasion, in good agreement to the 

wear mechanism defined on the surface of molds in real applications. The addition of 

nanostructured ZrO2 successfully increased the abrasion resistance of coatings, as above 

demonstrated in the reciprocating tribological tests. However, the specific wear rate values 

calculated with abrasion tests were two to three orders of magnitude higher than those 

achieved in reciprocating sliding tests.

Figure 4.4 - Specific wear rate of coatings, calculated from the slope of a straight line fitted to the points plotted 

in Figure 4.3. 

As a global conclusion, it was demonstrated that nanostructured ZrO2 additions 

increased the hardness and improved the tribological behavior of Ni-based coatings. 

Furthermore, it was observed that the best properties were achieved when coatings were 

produced with mechanically alloyed powders, which promoted an evenly distribution of ZrO2 

particles and therefore, an improvement on the mechanical and tribological properties.

Chapter V - Study of the influence of V additions on the properties of TiSi(V)N films deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering

Chapter V 

5. Study of the influence of V additions on the properties 

of TiSi(V)N films deposited by DC reactive magnetron 

sputtering 

5.1. Introduction 

This chapter is on the study of the effect of V incorporation on the chemical 

composition, microstructure, mechanical properties, residual stresses, oxidation behavior, 

thermal stability and tribological performance of TiSi(V)N thin films, containing different Si 

contents, deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering. The results presented in this chapter 

are supported by the papers in Annexes G to I. 

Annex G details the influence of V additions on the chemical composition, 

microstructure, mechanical properties (hardness and Young’s Modulus) and oxidation 

resistance of TiSi(V)N coatings. The effect of Si incorporation on the properties of the TiN 

system was also assessed in this paper, for comparison purposes. The thermal stability and the 

diffusion processes occurring during the annealing of TiSiN and TiSi(V)N films are presented 

and discussed in Annex H. Annex I is dedicated to the study of the effect of V incorporation 

on the tribological behavior of TiSi(V)N coatings at room temperature and its comparison 

with that of TiN, TiVN and TiSiN films prepared as references.

5.2. Microstructure, residual stresses and mechanical properties 

Three series of TiSiN films with different Si contents, each series with increasing V 

content, were deposited in a d.c. reactive magnetron sputtering machine, set with two 

rectangular magnetron cathodes working in unbalanced mode. A Ti target, with holes 

distributed throughout the preferential erosion zone, and a TiSi2 composite target were used 

for the depositions. The different silicon contents were achieved by changing the power 

density applied to each target and the V content was varied by changing the number of high 

purity rods of Ti and V placed in the holes of the Ti target. Three V contents were added to 

the films by using 4, 8 and 12 pellets of V. In all cases the total power applied to the targets 

was 1500 W. To serve as reference, a TiN film was deposited from the Ti target using 2000 

W of power. Ti and TiN interlayers were deposited as bonding layers, in order to increase the 

adhesion of the coatings. The interlayer also contained V when V pellets are placed in the Ti 

target. In all the depositions the time was adjusted in order to obtain coatings with 

approximately 2.5 µm of total thickness (including interlayers). The total working gas 

pressure was kept constant at 0.3 Pa, using approximately 30 and 17 sccm of Ar and N2, 

respectively. A summary of the studied coatings and the nomenclature for them adopted (used 

in Annex G) is shown in Table 5.1.

As it would be expected, the simultaneous decrease in the power density of Ti target 

and its increase in TiSi2 target, allowed producing coatings with increasing Si contents. In a 

similar way, increasing the number of V pellets allowed to deposit coatings with increasing V 

contents. In all cases, coatings with nitrogen contents close to 50 at.% were achieved. All

films showed a columnar micro-structure. As Si content was increased, the columns size and 

the surface roughness were firstly reduced and, then, increased for the highest silicon content. 

V additions did not change the global type of the cross section morphology.  

As a general trend, the structure of the films could be assigned to a fcc NaCl-type 

crystalline phase as e.g. TiN (ICDD card 87-0628). The influence of increasing Si content on 

the TiN system and the effect of V content on the TiSiN coating with the lowest silicon 

content (S1-y series) is shown in Figure 5.1. Concerning TiSiN films, a loss of crystallinity 

was observed for the coating with the highest Si content, suggesting an amorphization of the 

structure. Furthermore, a shift of the diffraction peaks to higher angles was observed with 

increasing Si content, suggesting the formation of a substitutional solid solution. In fact, with 

Si in solid solution, its smaller atomic radius promoted the contraction of the TiN lattice and 

the consequent shift of XRD peaks for higher angles. Residual stresses could not be the cause 

for the peaks shift since they were compressive and similar in all the films (approximately 3 

GPa). The formation of a substitutional solid solution was explained by the low deposition 

temperature, together with a low substrate ion bombardment, condition that do not provide the 

necessary mobility of the arriving species for Si-N phase segregation and consequent 

formation of a nanocomposite arrangement, i.e. nanocrystalline TiN grains embedded in a 

Si3N4 matrix. V incorporation in TiSiN films also made moving the peaks to higher angles, 

behavior once again related to a smaller unit cell due to the replacement of Ti by the smaller 

V atoms. In these coatings the compressive residual stresses were also in the range of ~3 to ~4 

GPa.

The dependence of hardness and Young’s Modulus on the Si and V contents is shown 

in Figure 5.2. With Si incorporation, the hardness of the coatings increased up to a maximum 

value of 27 GPa (6.7 at.% Si), trend attributed exclusively to a solid solution hardening 

mechanism since, as above referred, the level of compressive residual stresses was similar for 

all the films. A further increase in the silicon content led to a decrease in the hardness, in good 

agreement with the loss of crystallinity of this coating. The Young´s Modulus monotonously 

decreased with Si incorporation, which is related to the progressive importance of Si-bonds in 

the TiN lattice.  

Concerning the effect of V additions, similar evolution was observed for all the Si 

compositions (see Figure 5.2 b) for S1-y series). A slight increase in the hardness and 

Young´s modulus was observed for lower V contents, followed by a drop for the highest one. 

Similar explanation was suggested, the hardness enhancement was attributed to solid solution 

hardening since, again, the compressive residual stress values are very similar. The coatings 

with the highest Si content displayed the lowest hardness and Young’s modulus among all the 

V rich coatings, in good agreement with their low crystallinity.

In relation to the adhesion of coatings, only two failure modes were observed on the 

scratch track of the coatings; the first cracking and the first chipping. Globally all the coatings 

showed to be well adherent to the substrate, exhibiting high critical load values. In general V 

incorporation did not have significant influence in the critical loads whereas, globally, the 

addition of Si gave rise to a small decrease of their values, particularly for Lc1 (see Figure 

5.3).

5.3. Oxidation resistance and diffusion mechanisms 

The effect of increasing Si and V content on the onset point of oxidation of TiSi(V)N 

systems were studied in a TGA equipment. The films were annealed from room temperature 

up to 1200 ºC at a ramp temperature of 20 ºC/min. Si incorporation in TiN film strongly 

increased the onset of oxidation, being S3-0 sample the most oxidation resistant. On the other 

hand, V addition to TiSiN decreased the onset point of oxidation down to a value close to 500 

ºC, independently of the Si and V contents, value even lower than for TiN film.  

In order to better study the oxidation resistance of the coatings, isothermal annealing at 

selected temperatures and times were performed. TiN was annealed at 600 ºC during 30 min, 

S2-0 was heat treated at 900 ºC during 1h and finally S2-8 was annealed at three different 

temperatures: 550 ºC during 1h, 600 ºC during 30 min and 700 ºC during 10 min. The results

are plotted in Figure 5.4. When time and temperature are considered, TiSiN is far the best 

resistant to oxidation. Furthermore, it is also confirmed that V incorporation decreased 

significantly the oxidation resistance of TiSiN coatings, even to lower values than TiN.

section morphology of coating: a) S2-0 oxidized at 900 ºC during 1 h, b) S2-8 oxidized at 600 ºC during 30 min. 

The main oxides detected on the surface of the coatings after annealing can be 

summarized as follows: i) in TiN and TiSiN films, TiO2 - rutile and anatase, were the main 

oxides detected; however, in the last case, SiO2 was also present, localized beneath the TiO2 

layer; ii) in TiSi(V)N at 550 and 600 ºC the main oxides were Ti(V)O2 and ?-V2O5, the latter 

displaying different orientations depending on the isothermal temperature and time; at 700 ºC, 

which is a temperature higher than the melting temperature of ?-V2O5, ?-V2O5 was formed, 

resulting from a reduction process of ?-V2O5. In situ XRD analysis performed in TiSi(V)N 

coatings in the range from 500 – 750 ºC (see Annex H) allowed to demonstrate that the first

oxide being formed was Ti(V)O2 phase. TiSiN film exhibited a typical parabolic oxidation 

weight gain as a function of the time. According to STEM elemental maps analysis a double 

oxide layer was formed in this case: on top a TiO2 layer followed by a SiO2 layer. Thus, the 

excellent oxidation resistance of the TiSiN film was a result of the formation of a continuous 

protective SiO2 layer in the interface film/oxide scale (for more detail see Annex H) that 

hindered the ions diffusion and, thus, protecting the coating from further oxidation. In the case 

of the V rich coating, the isothermal curves tested at 550 and 600 ºC showed two steps: at an 

early stage, the weight gain increase over time is linear whilst, in the second stage, a parabolic 

evolution can be fitted. For higher temperatures (700 ºC) only the parabolic evolution was 

observed but with a strong increase in the mass gain due to the melting of V-O phases.  

The structural analysis of the oxide scale when the oxidation temperatures are lower 

than the melting point of ?-V2O5 showed that a two layer-oxide structure was formed, with a 

thick porous inner layer (SiO2 plus Ti(V)O2) and an outer discontinuous layer of ?-V2O5. To 

the first linear step in the oxidation curves was suggested the growing of Ti(V)O2, as a 

conjugation of a fast rate of mass transport in the oxide with a slower surface step 

accompanying the gas dissociation, adsorption and subsequent entry of oxygen into the 

Ti(V)O2 lattice. In fact, at the very beginning of the oxidation process, due to the high Ti 

content, a TiO2 layer started growing. The presence of V ions and its high solubility with Ti 

promoted the formation of Ti(V)O2 solid solution, which comprised vanadium cations with 

lower oxidation states, as V
3+

 ions [119, 129]. The substitution of Ti
4+

 by V
3+

 ions in the TiO2 

lattice would increase the concentration of interstitial metallic Ti
4+

 ions and, simultaneously, 

would decrease the number of excess electrons. The oxidation mechanism was inverted in 

relation to Ti-N, being the outwards diffusion of metallic ions (Ti
3+

 Ti
n+

) more favorable than 

the inwards diffusion of O
2- 

ions. There were several consequences of this inversion: (i) the 

oxidation rate increased substantially, (ii) the kinetics of the oxidation was not controlled any 

more by a diffusion process but by the rate of dissociation, adsorption and combination at the 

surface of O
2-

 with metallic ions, and (iii) the continuous and compact Si-rich layer cannot be 

formed. ?-V2O5 and ?-V2O5 phase showed to be to be formed exclusively on the top of the 

inner layer due to the V ions reduction on the surface. The parabolic beahaviour after the first 

linear increase in mass was explained by the oxide scale thickness increase, making harder the 

ion transport. Then, from a threshold thickness on, the ionic diffusion is the controlling step of

characteristic of ion diffusion controlled processes.

A detailed description of the oxidation mechanism occurring in TiSiN and TiSi(V)N 

coatings oxidation can be found in Annex H. 

5.4. Tribological behavior 

The tibological behavior of TiSi(V)N coatings at room temperature was assessed in a 

pin on disc equipment using two different balls, alumina (Al2O3) and high speed steel (HSS). 

The tests were performed with the same test conditions used for Ni-based coatings deposited 

by PTA. Coatings S2-4 and S2-8 were used to study the effect of V additions to the TiSiN 

(S2-0) and S3-8 film, which had a higher silicon and similar vanadium contents in relation to 

S2-8 coating, was used to understand the role of the Si on the films. Besides TiSiN (S2-0) 

film, the properties of the V-containing coatings were compared and discussed in relation to 

the TiN and TiVN films. The TiVN coating had a hardness of 23.8 GPa, a Young’s Modulus 

of 398 GPa, a similar level of residual stresses and slight higher adhesion critical load than 

any of the other coatings.  

The wear rate of the coatings tested at room temperature is shown in Figure 5.5. TiSiN 

was the coating showing the highest wear rate. With increasing V content the wear rate 

progressively dropped. Furthermore, for Al2O3 balls the wear rate was much lower than when 

the coatings slided against HSS balls. These results were in good agreement with the lower 

friction coefficient achieved when Al2O3 balls were used. The addition of V had the same 

influence for the TiN reference coating with a clear improvement of the tribological behavior. 

The worst performance of TiSiN among all the tested coatings was attributed to its low 

fracture toughness. When TiN and TiSiN coatings were tested against Al2O3 balls, an abrasion 

wear mechanism was shown to occur on both wear tracks. However, due to the lower fracture 

toughness of the TiSiN, deeper scratches and large loosely wear particles were formed in the 

wear track, leading to a strong abrasion of the surface and, thus, a higher wear rate.  

The decreased of the wear rate and the friction coefficient with vanadium 

incorporation was attributed to the formation of the V2O5 phase on the wear track of the 

coatings. This oxide acted as a lubricious tribo-film, protecting the coating from wear, being 

the protective effect as efficient as higher is the amount of V2O5 formed. In relation to S2-8 

film, TiVN coating (both with similar V content) presented lower wear rate. Such behavior 

was explained based on the effect of Si on the inhibition of V2O5 formation, resulting in 

higher wear rate and friction coefficient.  



Chapter V – Study of the influence of V additions on the properties of TiSi(V)N films deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering 

48 
Filipe Daniel Fernandes 

When tested against HSS ball, the counterparts were covered with both as-deposited 

and oxidized material; however, in TiSiN coating higher amounts of big wear debris were 

detected, resulting from the lower fracture toughness of this coating. Therefore, a higher 

abrasion of the surface was produced with consequent higher wear rate. For V-containing 

coatings, the much higher wear rates and friction values measured with HSS in comparison to 

Al2O3 balls were attributed to a less V2O5 oxide formation on the worn surfaces.  

A detailed characterization of the effect of V additions on the coatings wear and their 

correlation to the main wear mechanisms is shown in Annex I. 

 

 

Figure 5.5 - Wear rate of the coatings tested against Al2O3 and HSS balls. 

The effect of V incorporation on the abrasion resistance of TiSiN coatings (series S2-y 

films) was also assessed using the same test conditions as for the Ni-based coatings evaluated 

in Annex A. However, in this case, lower sliding distances were selected due to a different 

wear mechanism and a much lower coating thickness. The volume loss of coatings plotted as 

a function of the load times sliding distance parameter is presented in Figure 5.6; the 

respective results for the specific wear rate are plotted in Figure 5.7. As for the other 

tribological tests, the addition of vanadium gave rise to lower specific wear rates. This trend 

was more notorious for coatings with low V content. In all cases, the main wear mechanism, 

suggested by the analysis of the wear scars produced by the ball was 3-body abrasion, which 

reproduced the wear observed on the surface of real molds after a period of service. In 

comparison to pin-on-disc tests, the specific wear rate achieved with this abrasion test was 

higher about two orders of magnitude.

in Figure 5.6. 

In summary, although the nanocomposite structure was not formed in TiSi(V)N films, 

V additions significantly improve their mechanical and tribological properties; however, it has 

a detrimental effect on their oxidation resistance due to the outwards V ions diffusion to the 

surface impeding the formation of a continuous Si-O protective layer. The improvement of 

the tribological properties with V incorporations was related to V2O5 formation on the sliding 

contact that acted as a lubricious tribo-film, decreasing the friction and protecting the coating 

from wear.

Chapter VI 

6. Conclusions and Future Research 

The main aim of the research activity carried out in this thesis was the improvement of 

the surface properties of molds used in glass containers production, through the application of 

several types of coatings. Two methodologies were assessed: i) the optimization of 

conventional Ni-based coatings currently applied on mold surfaces; ii) the development of 

new coating systems deposited by emergent technologies. In the first part, the effect of base 

material (cast iron) dilution, induced by the change in arc current, on the properties of Ni-

based coatings deposited by the PTA process was investigated, while in the second part two 

different topics were explored. Firstly, the influence of nanostructured ZrO2 additions on the 

properties of Ni-based alloy coatings deposited by APS process were studied while, in the 

second topic, the influence of V additions on the properties of TiSi(V)N thin films, containing 

different Si contents, deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering, was evaluated. The 

coatings have markedly different morphological features, physical, mechanical, oxidation and 

tribology properties depending on the deposition technology and, thus, their direct 

comparison becomes sometimes without sense. Nevertheless, although individual 

comparisons were already drawn in each chapter, some common aspects among different 

coatings deserve comparison, mainly those directly related with the potential industrial 

applicability, as it will be described below. 



Chapter VI - Conclusions and Future Research 

52 
Filipe Daniel Fernandes 

The dilution degree of the substrate promoted by changing the arc current affected all 

the functional properties of the Ni-based alloy coatings. Their hardness, oxidation resistance 

and tribological behavior were strongly influenced by the micro-structure which consisted 

typically in Ni-Fe fcc solid solution phase, with intendendritic phases rich in Cr-B, Ni-Si and 

Fe-Mo-C. Although, the number of precipitates in the grain boundaries increased with the 

dilution, the hardness of the coatings was reduced due to the growing influence of the softer 

material of the substrate. As a consequence, also the abrasion wear resistance, calculated from 

tests performed at room temperature with silica slurry, decreased with increasing substrate 

dilution. The same trend was observed in another tribological test (pin-on-disc), having been 

observed specific wear rates varying as much as two up to three orders of magnitude. At high 

temperature, dilution showed a beneficial effect on the wear resistance of coatings, behavior 

explained by the decrease of the oxidation resistance due to the incorporation of base material 

elements. In fact, due to the lower oxidation resistance of the coatings produced with higher 

dilution, an easy and fast formation of a high amount of oxide debris on the worn surface 

occurred, which by agglomeration gave rise to a protective tribo-layer improving the wear 

resistance of the coating. The post-deposition heat treatment of the coatings induced a 

reduction of the hardness restricted to the partially melted and heat affected zones. In 

conclusion, the advantages and drawbacks associated with the degree of dilution indicate that 

to produce the best and most performing coating compromises should be found between the 

mechanical properties, level of oxidation and wear resistance of coatings. 

Nanostructured ZrO2 additions to Ni-based alloy coatings had different impact when 

mechanically alloyed mixed powders (MA) or separated powders (Dual) were used. MA 

powders deposited coatings displayed a homogeneous and compact microstructure with small 

zirconia particles evenly distributed in the matrix; contrasting with a porous microstructure, 

full of semi-melted Ni powders with large particles of ZrO2 entrapped in grain boundaries, 

responsible for a brittle behavior. In both cases, addition of ZrO2 improved the hardness and 

wear behavior. The brittleness of the coatings was determinant on the wear resistance; 

therefore, the wear rates increased when going from MA powders, through Dual powders up 

to pure ZrO2 coatings. All the APS coatings showed higher hardness values than the PTA 

deposited Ni-based ones; however, their micro-abrasion resistance was worse, differing one 

order of magnitude, fact explained by the low cohesion between powders. In conclusion, for 

any possible application of ZrO2-containing coatings in the protection of glass molds, an 

additional melting treatment will be required, in order to improve the cohesion and overcome 

the brittleness problems.

Si and V additions to TiN and TiSiN systems, respectively, did not change 

significantly either the global type of columnar morphology or the diffraction peaks indexed 

to a crystalline fcc TiN-type phase. A shift of the diffraction peaks to higher angles was 

always observed with either Si or V additions, indicating the placement of those elements in 

substitutional solid solution in the TiN lattice. Therefore, the required nanocomposite 

structure needed for the control of vanadium diffusion was not deposited. The presence of Si 

and V incorporation in solid solution in TiN gave rise to a slight increase in the hardness, 

although for the high contents an inverse trend was observed. In comparison to previous thick 

coatings, much higher hardness values could be achieved with the thin films, as shown in 

Figure 6.1, which is an indication of a possible compensation of their lower thickness for 

glass molds protection. 

 

 

Figure 6.1 - Hardness of coatings studied in the aim of this thesis, deposited by different deposition techniques. 

Si and V had an antagonist behavior in relation to oxidation resistance and tribological 

behavior. Moreover, contrarily to what could be expected, silicon which improved 

significantly the oxidation resistance of TiN system, had a deleterious influence on the wear 

resistance. On the other hand, vanadium that promoted an abrupt drop in the oxidation 

resistance of the TiSiN coatings presented an excellent tribological behavior. The low 

oxidation resistance of TiSi(V)N films was attributed to the rapid V ions diffusion throughout 

the oxide scale, which inhibited the formation of a continuous protective silicon oxide layer 

which, in case of TiSiN is the responsible for the high oxidation resistance. However, the

vanadium at the oxidized surface was promptly oxidized forming a lubricious and protective 

oxide, the V2O5. Therefore, despite the observed decrease in oxidation resistance of films 

containing vanadium, this should not be regarded as a disadvantage from the tribological 

point of view, as the V2O5 phase detected can act as a solid lubricant. Among all the studied 

coatings, V-containing coatings displayed the worst oxidation resistance (see comparison in 

Figure 6.2). Although TiSiN coating was the most oxidation resistant coating, even in 

comparison with the Ni-based coatings (specimens 1 and 3) well known for applications at 

high temperature, the addition of vanadium to TiSiN degraded completely its oxidation 

behavior. At temperatures higher than the melting point of the V2O5 phase (~675 ºC), the 

integrity of the V rich coatings is loss due to rapid oxidation. This can be a drawback for the 

application of TiSi(V)N coatings in molds surface protection. Thus, further studies to control 

the V diffusion and, consequently, to improve the oxidation resistance of the coatings, are 

required. The objective will be the deposition of these films with different structures, i.e. as a 

nanocomposite (TiVN grains embedded in a Si3N4 matrix) or as a multilayer structure (TiVN 

layers alternating with Si3N4 layers). 

 

Figure 6.2 - Comparison of the oxidation weight gain of Ni-based coatings deposited by PTA and TiSi(V)N ones 

deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering. 

The tribological experiments performed at room temperature, either by micro-scale 

abrasion or pin-on-disc testing revealed that V additions could improve the wear behavior of 

TiN and TiSiN films. A comparison of the specific wear rate of all the films calculated from 

the tests achieved by both techniques using the same test conditions (see Figures 6.3 and 6.4) 

showed that V-containing thin films performed much better than the thicker coatings.

Preliminary tribological tests performed by pin-on-disc of a TiSi(V)N film at high 

temperature also revealed a better performance in relation to the thicker ones (Ni-based 

coatings deposited by PTA). In fact, even for a testing temperature 50 ºC higher (see Figure 

6.5), TiSi(V)N film showed close to one or two orders of magnitude lower wear rates than Ni-

based coatings and uncoated gray cast iron, respectively.  

In conclusion, although further studies at high temperature are required to better 

characterize the tibological behavior of V rich coatings, the preliminary tests showed that 

TiSi(V)N films had potential for the protection of mold surfaces, despite their low thickness 

in comparison to thick coatings. Nevertheless, it should be remarked that pin-on-disc and 

micro-scale abrasion apparatus did not reproduce well the loading conditions to which molds 

are submitted. Therefore the development of new tribology equipment is recommended for 

reproducing the real working conditions, i.e. tests should simulate abrasion at high 

temperature. Only with such equipment it will be possible to have a proper prediction of the 

coatings wear during service. 

Finally, several remarks should be considered in this comparison between thin and 

thick coatings. In a first glance, it could be thought that a higher coating thickness (typical of 

PTA and APS coatings) could compensate a lower wear resistance. However, in glass 

containers production, many times dimensional tolerances in the molds are just a few 

microns, values incompatible with a possible wear out of the total thickness of a thick coating, 

increasing that way, the viability of thin films as a solution for molds protection. On the other 

hand, the use of thin films also allows overcome the poor thermal conductivity attributed to 

the use of thick ceramic coatings. In fact, their lower thickness permits a much more efficient 

cooling of the coating and base material in spite of the base thermal conductivity of both types 

of coatings could be the same. Therefore, lower power consumption for molds cooling down 

can be expected, thereby reducing production costs. Hence, for future work, thermal 

conductivity tests are recommended to compare the cooling rate of molds protected by thick 

and thin coatings. In relation to maintenance problems, the use of these self-lubricant coatings 

can also remedy the drawbacks that normally liquid lubricant brings (corrosion and 

disassembling problems), which frequently led to the molds failure and, therefore, to 

increasing production costs. In fact solid lubricious oxides are not as reactive as liquid 

lubricants are and the global amount used is much lower. Thus, the probability of corrosion is 

much lower allowing more uniform, durable and efficient lubrication of the produced parts. 

Furthermore, the use of these coatings has a huge advantage from the environmental point of 

view, since they are not as harmful for the environment as the liquid ones are. In relation to 



Chapter VI - Conclusions and Future Research

Filipe Daniel Fernandes 

the production of the coatings, despite the high production costs of sputtered films, the 

reduction of the steps in molds production, such as final machining and polishing (see Table 

2.2 in chapter II) and the high number of components that can be coated at the same time, 

when compared to the technology used for the production of thicker ones, mitigate the costs 

of protection of the molds. With the expectancy of increasing lifetime, due to their superior 

mechanical and tribological properties, thin sputtered films should be considered in relation to 

thick coatings in the protection of molds for glass industry. Specifically, V rich coatings are 

of great relevance and promising for molds protection. Furthermore, its application could be 

extended to related areas where high temperature resistance and lubricious properties are 

required, such as the protection of machining tools for high-speed cutting and dry machining 

processes.

The plasma transferred arc (PTA) technique is currently used to coat the edges of moulds for the glass industry
with nickel-based hardfacing alloys. However the hardness and wear performance of these coatings are
significantly affected by the procedure adopted during the deposition of coatings. The aim of the present
investigation is to study the effect of arc current on the microstructure, hardness and wear performance of a
nickel-based hardfacing alloy deposited on gray cast iron, currently used in molds for the glass industry.
Microstructure, hardness and wear assessments were used to characterize the coatings. Electron probe micro
analysis (EPMA) mapping, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM/EDAX) and
X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the microstructure of the deposits. The effect of post weld
heat treatment (PWHT) on the microstructure and hardness was also studied. The typical microstructure of
the coatings consists of dendrites of Ni–Fe, in the FCC solid solution phase, with interdendritic phases rich in
Cr–B, Ni–Si and Fe–Mo–C. Increasing the arc current reduces the proportion of porosity and hardness of the
coatings and modifies their composition due to the increasing dilution of the cast iron. The partial melted zone
(PMZ) had a typical white cast iron plus martensite microstructure, while the heat affected zone (HAZ) had
only a martensite structure. The wear tests showed decreasing wear resistance with decreasing hardness of
the coatings. PWHT reduces the hardness of the PMZ and HAZ but does not significantly alter the hardness of
the bulk coating.

1. Introduction

Traditionally, molds for the glass industry are manufactured from
gray cast iron or copper alloys due to their superior thermal behavior,
relatively low cost and excellent thermal conductivity. This is
associated with high hardness and good wear resistance and leads
to a high production rate of glass parts. However, the edges of the
molds made of these materials are sensitive to wear in heavy duty
cycles; so they need to be coated with materials that are more
resistant to high temperature and wear [1].

The coating of these edges is frequently done by plasma transferred
arc (PTA), using nickel-based filler metals [2]. Normally the PTA process
produces very high quality, thicker deposits, offering optimal protection
with minimal thermal distortion of the parts, low environmental impact
and high deposition rates in single layer deposits [3]. It allows perfectly
controlled deposition of alloys on mechanical parts that are subject to
harsh environments, significantly extending their service life [4]. The
composition and properties of the coating are greatly influenced by the
type and dilution of the substrate. Balasubramanian et al. [5] suggest
that the dilution of coatings should be controlled through the relevant
process parameters (transferred arc current, travel speed, powder feed
rate, torch oscillation frequency and stand-off distance). Takano et al. [6]
studied the influence of arc current variation, arc constriction and
plasma gas flow on the characteristics of Co coatings. They concluded
that current intensity is the parameter that most significantly affects the
characteristics of the deposits as higher currents increase the dilution of
the base material and decrease the hardness of the coatings. Díaz et al.
[7] mentioned that the dilution also increases with gas plasma flow in
stellite 6 coatings.

Nickel-based hardfacing alloys have become increasingly popular
in recent years owing to their excellent performance in environments
where abrasion, corrosion and elevated temperature are factors. The
microstructure of Ni-based hardfacing alloy deposits has been studied
using various alloy compositions and different substrates [8–10].
However, most of the studies consider the deposition of nickel alloys
on stainless steels; there are no references to characterization of such
deposits applied to gray cast iron.

Gurumoorthy et al. [8], who worked with nickel-base superalloys
deposited by PTA on stainless steel, reported that the microstructure of
the deposit consists of ?-Ni solid solution dendrites, carbides, and
interdendritic eutectics composed of ?-Ni and other phases identified as

being Ni-rich borides. The microstructure and mechanical properties of
Ni base alloys are greatly influenced by the alloying elements. For
example aluminum, titanium and niobium are added to strengthen the
material through the formation of ?? gamma prime (Ni3(Al,Ti)) and
boron and zirconium are added to improve the creep strength and
ductility [9,10].

This paper details an investigation of the microstructure, hardness and
3-body abrasion behavior of a nickel-based hardfacing alloy deposited by
PTA on gray cast iron with different weld currents. Microstructural
changes in the HAZ as well as the effect of the post weld heat treatment on
the microstructure and hardness of the coatings are also examined.

2. Experimental procedure

Thecoatings were deposited byPTAtechnology (usinga Commersald
Group ROBO 90 machine) on flat surfaces of gray cast iron blocks using a
nickel-based hardfacing alloy. This technique obtains thicker coatings
with lower porosity and higher production rate than the Flame Spraying
and Gas Tungsten Arc Welding processes. The composition of base and
deposit materials is given in Table 1. The same process parameters were
used for each deposition with theexception of the arc current, whichwas
100 A for specimen 1, 128 A for specimen 2 and 140 A for specimen 4.
The edges of a mold made of the same material but with a machined U-
shaped groove were coated with the same alloy using the parameters of
specimen 2. This specimen is referred to as specimen 3. The surfacing
parameters used in the tests are listed in Table 2. The blocks of base
material were induction heated before coating, in order to reduce
thermal shock, thus reducing the tendency to crack. After coating, the
blocks were left to cool to room temperature in still air. Samples
containing coating and base material were removed from each block and
the mold for further analysis.

The samples for microstructural analysis were polished and etched
following conventional procedures. Etchingwas performed usingequal
parts of nitric acid and glacial acetic acid, to reveal the microstructure of
the deposits. Marble's solution (HCl (50 ml)+CuSO4 (10 g)+H20
(50 ml)) was used to reveal the microstructure of the cast iron. The
microstructure of the different regions of the samples was characterized
by optical microscopy (OP), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray
diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). The
chemical composition was evaluated by Electron Probe Microanalysis
(EPMA). The hardness profile across the interface of the coatings was
determined with Vickers testing using a 5 N load at 15 s.

Some specimens were subjected to a subsequent heat-treatment
at 850 °C for 1 h and then cooled in the furnace to room temperature,
in order to reduce brittle phases present in the partially melted and
heat affected zones. Microstructural and hardness profiles of these
specimens were obtained.

Wear tests on the coated surfaces were carried out at room
temperature in ball-cratering devices. In these devices, a ball is placed
on a flat specimen in the presence of abrasive slurry and rotated while
being submitted to a specific load in order to produce a spherical cup-
shaped depression. This process was used in order to reproduce the
wear mechanism present at the surface of the coatings on glass molds
which have been in service for a long time. An AISI 52100 steel ball
bearing 25.4 mm in diameter was used at constant rotational speed of
75 rpm. High purity SS40 silica with angular particles averaging

3.10 ?m in size was used as an abrasive to replicate the effect of the
melted glass. The slurry used was prepared with a proportion of
28 vol.% of silica in water.

The duration of the test, measured by the number of rotations, was
selected according to the material and the test conditions employed.
The normal load used was 0.1 N.

Photographs of the spherical depressions were taken in order to
measure their dimensions. The wear volume was calculated by Eq (1),
where R is the ball radius and b is the crater chordal diameter.

V = ? × b4

Archard's model, given by Eq (2), is the one most commonly applied
to wear results to determine a parameter to quantify the wear behavior
of materials. In this equation P is the normal load, l is the sliding distance
and k is the specific wear rate. The specific wear rate is the parameter
which quantifies the wear behavior.

V = k × P × l ð2Þ

To quantify the specific wear rate a linear version of Archard's
model was applied and statistical analysis was used to estimate the
error of measurement [11].

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Microstructure

Four distinct regions were observed in the cross section of each of the
coatings deposited with the differentwelding conditions, asillustrated in
Fig. 1 A) for sample 3. Those regions are the fusion zone (FZ), composed
of the Ni-alloy and the base material melted during the process, the
partially melted zone (PMZ), which is the area immediately outside the
FZ where liquation can occur during welding, the heat-affected zone
(HAZ), which was not melted but underwent microstructural changes
and the base material (BM), whose microstructure remains unaffected
during the coating deposition thermal cycle. The same regions were
observed by M. Pouranvari [12], who studied the welding of gray cast
iron using nickel filler metal deposited by shielded metal arc welding.

Fig. 1 B) to E) illustrates the microstructures of the zones marked with
the digits 1 to 4 in Fig. 1 A) in higher magnification.

Fig. 1 B) shows the transition zone between the coating and the
partially melted zone. Fig. 1 C) illustrates that the HAZ is basically
composed of a martensitic structure (needle shape), which is found
mainly in the region closer to the fusion line, however, precipitates and
graphite flakes are also present. The microstructure of the base material is
principally ferritic with flakes of graphite and precipitates uniformly
distributed in the matrix (Fig. 1 E)). Fig. 1 D) illustrates the transition
between the HAZ and the base material. The nature and relative size of
those zones are determined by the coating procedure, mainly the heat
input during the process, and the composition of the cast iron and
hardfacing alloy used. The constitution of the main zones will be discussed
separately, in order to provide a better understanding of the effect of
current on their characteristics.

3.1.1. Melted zone
Fig. 2 illustrates the effect of the current on the dilution produced

in each sample. The dilution is defined as the proportion between the
area of melted base material and the total area of the melted zone,
Fig. 3. Aspect of the coatings of: A) specimen 1, B) specimen
both measured from the cross section of the coating using Photoshop
image analysis. These images show that as the current is increased in
the range 100–140 A, the dilution steadily increases from 28% to 59%.
Specimen 3 in the image illustrates the groove shape usually machined
in the mold before coating. Comparing specimens 2 and 3, which were
both coated using the same current, it is possible to see that the groove
produces only a small change in the dilution and the results obtained
from the flat blocks can be extrapolated to molds.

The dilution of cast iron modifies the composition of the coatings,
as illustrated in Table 3, which shows the chemical composition
measured by EPMA at various points of the coating and the substrate
of specimen 3. Point 1 is located close to the coating surface, point 2 at
the mid-thickness of the coating, point 3 in the coating close to the
interface and the other two points are in the bulk cast iron; point 4
close to the interface and point 5 distant from it. The amount of iron in
the coating (N16%) is much higher than that provided by the
hardfacing alloy (1.08%), producing a consequent reduction in the
nickel content. According to Ezugwu et al. [9] the increase in iron
content in the coatings tends to decrease their oxidation resistance
because of the formation of a less adherent oxide scale. The increase in
Mo content in the coating is also caused by the dilution of the cast iron
because it is absent in the hardfacing alloy. Although the true carbon
content value could be skewed by contamination, carbon is present in
the coating in large quantities, again due to the contribution of the
graphite from the cast iron. Thus, increasing the arc current will
increase the dilution and the chemical composition of the coating will
change accordingly.

All coatings contained small random pores throughout the cross
section, as shown in Fig. 3. According to F. A. L. Dullien [13], the
“volumetric” and “area” porosity proportions are equivalent for random-
structured porous media, which agrees with our results. The area of the

poresvisibleundertheopticalmicroscopewascalculatedusingtheImageJ
program (developed at the National Institutes of Health, United States).
The proportion of porosity calculated is very low for all specimens; 0.35%
for specimen 1 with an average pore size of 1.45±0.58 ?m, 0.32% for
specimen 2 with an average pore size of 1.61±0.65 ?m and 0.28% for
specimen 4 with an average pore size of 1.37±0.40 ?m. This decrease in
the proportion of micropores in the coatings as current increases can be
correlated with the refinement of the dendritic microstructure mentioned
below. The decrease in dendrite size reduces the amount of liquid metal
trapped by dendrites during solidification, reducing the number of voids
in the microstructure. Charmeux el al [14] mentioned this mechanism in
the solidification of Al micro castings. On the other hand the cast iron also
exhibits significant porosity, with pores reaching 17 ?m in diameter, as
illustrated in Fig. 3 D).

The typical microstructure of the coatings is shown in Fig. 4. The
microstructures consist of dendrites of the Ni–Fe solid solution phase,
with columnar morphology oriented along the direction of heat flow
and torturous grain boundaries. The microstructure contains C flakes
(dark floret-like structures) equally distributed through the micro-
structure. The chemical composition of the Ni-based powder (low
carbon content see Table 1) does not explain the large number of
these flakes which can only be attributed to the dilution of cast iron
induced by the PTA process. Furthermore, small interdendritic
precipitates can also be detected. These are possibly carbides, as
explained below. Fig. 4 A–C) shows that an increase in the arc current
and, therefore, an increase in dilution, allows carbides and C-flakes in
the microstructure to be more easily detected and observed. It was
thought that there could be some coarsening of the microstructure as
the current was increased due to greater heat input. However this was
not observed. Fig. 4 shows that the dendritic structure becomes finer
as the current increases. For example, the average ternary dendrite
spacing for the specimens 1 and 4 is 15.4 and 11.2 ?m, respectively. As
explained below, this refinement can be related to the change in the
composition of the deposited material due to its increasing dilution as
the arc current increases.

The phenomenon of circular “islands”, which frequently occur close to
the interface of the coating, is common to all the specimens (see Fig. 4 D)
for specimen 1), These islands are characterized by the total absence of
graphite. According to the Commersald company [15] they are caused
when powder grains not melted by the plasma arc subsequently melt in
contact with the pool. Near the interface a cellular microstructure finer
thanthedendritic structure was observed for all thesamples, as illustrated
in Fig. 4 D) for specimen 1, where the grain size is approximately 12 ?m.
This refinement may be due to the higher solidification rates involved in
the boundary because of the efficient thermal exchange ensured by the
high volume ratio substrate/coating of the base material, as suggested by
Gatto et al. [3].

SEM analysis gives a more detailed view of the microstructure of the
coatings. Fig. 5 shows a SEM image of the microstructure of the coating
of specimen 1. The image shows that in addition to the dendrites of the
Ni Fe solid solution phase and graphite flakes the grain boundary is
formed of two phases: a light gray phase (like-grain) and a dark gray
one. EDAX spectra showed that the light gray phase and the dark gray
phase are rich in silicon and chromium, respectively.

A detailed analysis was carried out to study the main constituents of
the coatings using EPMA. WDS (wavelength dispersion spectroscopy)

maps of the most abundant elements of the coating for all the specimens
were obtained. Fig. 6 A) represents a SEM image of the microstructure of
the deposit for the specimen 1. The respective elemental maps of Fe, Ni,
Si, Cr, Al, B, C and Mo are shown in Fig. 6 B–I), color-coded such that the
lowest concentration of the element analyzed is indicated in purple and
the highest in red. The results of the WDS maps for specimen 1 reveal
that the dendrites are rich in iron, silicon and aluminum, while
boundaries are rich in boron, silicon and chromium. Nickel is distributed
almost uniformly throughout the structure, except in areas where
graphite flakes are present. In the boundary chromium appears, to
exclude siliconas these elements do not overlap. However, chromium
and boron do overlap in the boundaries, as illustrated in Fig. 6 E) and H).
Thus, it can be concluded that the borders of the boundary are rich in Si
whereas the middles of theboundaries are mainly composed of B and Cr.
Comparing the information from Figs. 5 and 6 it is possible to conclude
that the light gray (like-grain) phase is rich in silicon and the dark gray
phase is rich in chromium, which agrees with the EDAX analysis. Carbon
concentrates chiefly in the graphite flakes, as shown in Fig. 6 F), though
atsome particular points theincrementin theC signalwasalsoobserved
in the boundary, mainly coinciding with the B signal (see circled zone in
B and C maps) suggesting that carbides may have precipitated. Although
not visible in the C-map, very small agglomerates of Mo can be detected
in Fig. 6 alsosuggesting formationof carbides. However, asshown below
by XRD analysis, these carbides were not identified, probably due to
their small size and/or content.

Theincreaseinthe arc currentand, consequently, inthedilutionof cast
iron brought some changes in the distribution of the main elements in the
microstructure, as shown by the WDS maps for specimen 4, illustrated in
Fig. 7. For this specimen, in comparison to sample 1, the main difference is
related to the Ni and Fe signals. It is clear from Fig. 7 that the zones in the

4100 F. Fernandes et al. / Surface &amp;amp; Coatings Technology 205 (2011) 4094–4106
interdendritic boundaries richer in iron are depleted in nickel and silicon
but that in the boundary these zones overlap with Cr and B. The grouping
of these maps suggests the presence of a Fe–Cr–B phase in the boundaries,
however, as can be seen later from the XRD analysis this is not identified,
as only a preferential association with the B–Cr phase is indicated, leading
free iron to combine with other elements. The Si rich zones, see Fig. 7 D),
are depleted of Fe and rich in Ni. In specimen 4, as well as the strong signal
given by the C flakes tiny molybdenum and carbon traces could be
detected in the surrounding material (where C is hardly present), which is
a clear contrast with the results from specimen 1. These elements are
distributed preferentially in the boundaries overlapping the Fe map,
suggesting the formation of a mixed carbide containing Fe and Mo. The
increase in the content of these elements is caused by the increased
dilution, since they are present only in the cast iron. Collins and Lippold
[16] and Ramirez et al. [17] mention that the presence of precipitates in
the interdendritic regions results in the formation of very tortuous grain
boundaries and the excess of theses precipitates stops the migration of the
grain boundaries. This can justify the lower grain size of the coating
deposited with 140 A in spite of the higher energy supplied to the coating
process. The literature also indicates that an increase in the molybdenum
and carbon content improves the rate of heterogeneous transformation
during solidification. These elements normally segregate in the grain
boundaries, thereby hindering grain growth [18]. Nevertheless, the
influence of the much higher number and content of graphite flakes
presented in the 140 A sample, these being segregated from the grain
boundaries during material solidification, should therefore also be

considered as an explanation for the lower grain size in this sample. As can
be seen in Fig. 4, C flakes are common in the grain boundaries.

The distribution of the chemical elements in the microstructure in
specimens 2 and 3 follows the trend mentioned above.

Fig. 8 shows the XRD spectra of specimens 1, 2 and 4. The analysis
of this data revealed that the major phase present in the coatings is a
(Ni, Fe) solid solution face centered cubic (ICDD card 47–1405-(111),
(200), (220), (311), and (222) peaks at 2?~51.1°, 59.8°, 89.6°, 111.42°
and 119.3°, respectively). WDS maps show that in Cr and B rich zones,
Si does not exist as it is connected to Ni. The overlapping of Ni and Si
signals in WDS maps suggests the presence of a Ni–Si phase, such as
Ni3Si (ICDD card 32–0699) shown in Fig. 8, corresponding to some of
the lower intensity experimental XRD peaks. The other peaks can be
adjusted either to a Cr-boride phase Cr5B3 (ICDD card 32–0278) or to
the Fe, Mo mixed carbide of M6C (Fe3Mo3C — ICDD 47–1191) type.
The increasing content of this latter phase through samples 1 to 4 sits
well with the WDS maps presented and interpreted above. Further-
more, the indexation is in agreement with the results from the
literature where similar phases were also detected in a nickel alloy
deposit on an austenitic stainless steel [8]. In summary, the increase in
the arc current increased the dilution of the cast iron, raising the iron,
carbon and molybdenum content in the coating, promoting dendrite
refinement of the microstructure due to the increase in precipitates
(Fe–Mo–C) and C flakes in the grain boundaries.

3.1.2. Partially melted zone (PMZ) and heat affected zone (HAZ)
These zones are critical in cast irons since the material can solidify

as white iron if cooling is rapid enough. If the amount of graphite
dissolved during welding is high enough it is likely that it will also
give rise to a continuous carbide network. This is undesirable as a
brittle carbide matrix can cause durability problems in the final part.
Fig. 9 shows the microstructure of this zone in specimen 3. In this
image, cementite (Fe3C — white phase) can be seen concentrated near
the interface. Fig. 9 B) shows the microstructure of the PMZ zone
under high magnification. The image displays a large amount of
cementite in the grain boundaries with acicular martensite inside the
grains. Some precipitates, identified as mixed titanium and molybde-
nium carbides (marked respectively with the numbers 1 and 2 in
Fig. 9 and identified in Fig. 10, were also found. As these phases are
hard and brittle this region is sensitive to in-service crack initiation
and propagation due to thermal and mechanical fatigue, as discussed
below. M. Pouranvari [12] also reported that a continuous brittle
network of coarse carbides along the weld fusion line may lead to
initiation of cracking.

In the heat affected zone, carbon can diffuse into the austenite
during welding and the austenite may subsequently transform into
brittle martensite due to the high cooling rate. Martensite is also

susceptible to cracking. The amount of martensite formed depends on
the composition of the cast iron and the thermal history of the zone.

3.2. Hardness

Fig. 11 shows the hardness profiles across the interface for all the
studied specimens. The vertical line in the graph represents the fusion
line. The hardness through the melted material is approximately
constant and tends to decrease with increasing weld current. This can
be related to the higher dilution induced by the process.

For all the samples, the highest hardness values were measured in the
area near the fusion line. A maximum hardness of 538 HV was observed
in specimen 1 and decreases with increasing arc current for the other
specimens. As previously documented, the microstructure in that region
consisted of hard martensite and cementite. The proportionof martensite
in the microstructure decreases with increasing distance from the fusion
line and, thus, the hardness decreases too. The microstructure in the HAZ
is directly related to the heat input in the process and therefore to the
current intensity used.

The high hardness values found in the PMZ and HAZ make these
regions potentially responsible for many of the mechanical problems
experienced in welds in cast iron. The most effective way to reduce

hardness and cracking problems in these regions is to reduce the
severity of the thermal cycle produced by the process. This can be done
by controlling the heat input and preheating during coating. Another
way to reduce the hardness in these zones is to submit the parts to an
annealing treatment, although this solution is expensive.

The precipitates, the porosity and the random distribution of graphite
flakes in the cast iron matrix can be linked to the variability of hardness in
the base material.

load×sliding distance”.
3.3. Effect of post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) on the microstructure
and hardness

Although the heat treatment did not induce significant changes in
the microstructure and hardness of the coatings, it induced substan-
tial changes in the PMZ and HAZ, as illustrated by the hardness
profiles before and after PWHT shown in Fig. 12 for specimen 4. This
specimen was produced with the highest arc current, and had the
lowest hardness values in the PMZ, as shown in Fig. 11. Fig. 12 shows
that even in this case the heat treatment (holding at 850 °C for 1 h)
produced little change in the coating but a substantial decrease in the
hardness of the PMZ and HAZ of the specimen. Similar behavior was
observed for the other specimens. This reduction in hardness can be
attributed to the reduction in the proportion of hard phases,
cementite and martensite, in these zones. After PWHT the base
material displays basically a perlitic/ferritic structure.
Fig. 13. Indentations in base material (specimen 4) after PWHT. A) indentation made in
the perlitic structure, and B) indentation made in the ferritic structure.
After heat treatment a large scatter of hardness measurements
continues to be observed in the cast iron. This scatter can be attributed
to local alterations in the microstructure, as shown in Fig. 13, which
represents the aspect of the indentations marked with the numbers 1
and 2 in the hardness profile in Fig. 12. The image reveals that if the
indentation impacts mainly the perlitic structure, the white zone in
Fig. 13 A), the hardness will be greater than if the indentation is
performed in the ferritic structure, the gray zone in Fig. 13 B). In
conclusion, PWHT is beneficial because it reduces hardness in the PMZ
and HAZ, without producing significant alterations in the melted zone.
3.4. Wear test

The wear tests were performed to predict the effect of the different
process parameters on the in-service wear behavior of the coated
components. The ball-cratering test results are shown in Fig. 14, as the
volume of material loss plotted against the product of sliding distance
(l) and normal load (P). A complete reliability analysis is summarized
in Table 4. The wear volume displays linear evolution with P×l, and
the slope corresponds to the specific wear rate. Specimen 1 exhibits
both the lowest wear volumes and the lowest specific wear rate,
therefore, it is the most resistant to wear. This is compatible with the
greatest hardness displayed by the coating of this specimen, as
illustrated in Fig. 11. Samples 2 and 4 display very similar wear
volumes, which is confirmed by similar hardness values; even so,
sample 2 has a specific wear rate slightly higher than sample 4.

Fig. 15 A) shows a SEM micrograph of a wear scar induced by the
ball-cratering device and Fig. 15 B) the surface of a coating of a mold
after a long time in service, which allows pitting to be identified as the
major failure mechanism. The image also shows some cracks that can
be attributed to the localized melting of hard, brittle phases.

Ball cratering is a micro-abrasion technique in which test
conditions can be tailored to adjust the wear mechanism to grooving,
which is plastic deformation controlled, or rolling, which is a fracture
controlled process [19]. Prior tests were used to select test parameters
compatible with rolling wear, designed to induce pitting failure.

The wear scar displays two modes of wear: pitting and grooving,
pitting being the more extensive. Grooving occurs when particles slip
onto the surface. Fig. 16 shows the morphology of these two wear
modes in higher magnification. The wear mechanism present in the
spherical cup depressions (essentially 3-body rolling wear) accurately
represents the wear mechanism in the molds. However one should
keep in mind that the molds in service are subject to other damage
mechanisms such as thermal and mechanical fatigue and corrosion at
high temperature.

4. Conclusions

The influence of the arc current used in the plasma transferred arc
process (PTA), as well as the effect of post-weld heat treatment, on the
microstructure, hardness and wear resistance of deposited layers was
analyzed in this study. The increase in the arc current increased the
dilution of the cast iron, changing the composition and microstructure
of the coatings. Moreover, the increase in current raises the quantity
of precipitates and C flakes at the grain boundaries, which leads to the
refinement of the microstructure. Increasing the arc current gives rise
to a reduction in the hardness in all regions of the coatings. The
reduction in the hardness of the coatings is accompanied by a
reduction in their wear resistance in wear tests performed at room
temperature with silica slurry. Post-weld heat treatment reduces the
hardness in the partially melted zone and heat affected zone as
opposed to the coatings themselves, where hardness remains
unaffected.

In the future, abrasion and oxidation tests at high temperature will
be done, in order to reproduce the conditions of industry application.

The aim of this investigation was to study the effect of PTA current (100 and 128 A) on the oxidation behavior
of nickel-based hardfacing coatings deposited on gray cast iron. The oxidation behavior of coatings held at
800 and 900 °C for 2 h in air was studied by thermogravimetry (TGA). The surface, as well as the cross?section,
of the coatings was characterized by scanning electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spec-
troscopy (SEM/EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). TGA results indicate that the coating produced with lower arc
current exhibits more effective oxidation resistance than that produced with higher current. This behavior could
be correlated with the dilution promoted by the PTA process, which changes the chemical composition of coat-
ings. As a consequence, different kinds of oxide scales were detected in each coating after isothermal oxidation. In
the specimen produced with a lower arc current and lower dilution a protective layer of Si–O is formed, while in
the specimen produced with a higher current two layers could be identified: an external one of Fe2O3, with small
features of Fe3O4 and NiFe2O4 spinel rich phases, and an internal one of Fe3O4 with small amount of a dark phase
evenly distributed rich in silicon, nickel and iron. The isothermal oxidation curve at 900 °C of the coating with
higher dilution showed two stages: at an early stage, the weight increase over time is almost linear whereas,
in a second stage, a parabolic law could be fitted to the experimental data. The other specimens followed only
a parabolic law.

1. Introduction

Cast irons and copper-alloys are commonly used in the production of
glass molds and accessories for the glass industry [1]. In service, molds are
subjected to very severe abrasion, wear, oxidation, and fatigue at high
temperatures, due to contact with melted glass, which limit their surface
life. As a rule, automated manufacturing processes are operated with
mold temperatures close to the critical temperature of the mold material.
Although the temperature of melted glass is about 1050 °C the surface
temperature of molds is currently in the range of 500–900 °C, due to an
internal cooling system in the molds. Above a critical temperature the
glass body starts to adhere to the mold surface. Higher temperatures
lead to mold failure. Therefore, protective coatings are normally applied
to give the molds high temperature resistance, with the aim of increasing
their lifetime in harsh environments [2,3].

Nickel-based superalloys gain an extremely important role in protec-
tion of surfaces in components for the glass industry due to their excel-
lent performance under conditions of abrasion and corrosion at elevated
temperatures [4–6]. Several processes have been used to apply coatings
to protect the surfaces of these components, as follows: (i) thermal
spraying processes such as high velocity oxy fuel (HVOF), atmospheric
plasma spraying (APS) and flame spraying (FS); and (ii) hardfacing pro-
cesses such as plasma transferred arc (PTA) and gas tungsten arc

welding (GTAW) processes. However, since hardfacing processes give
rise to a metallurgical bonding with the substrate they have been used
preferentially in the protection of mold surfaces as opposed to thermal
spraying processes which produce only mechanical bonding of the
layer to the substrate. Among the hardfacing processes above, PTA has
been widely used to protect the surface of molds, especially their
edges, because they are submitted to heavy wear duty cycles. This pro-
cess gives rise to thicker deposits of very high quality, providing a high
deposition rate in a single layer [7–9]. However, the chemical composi-
tion and properties of the coatings, as well their quality, are strongly
influenced by the dilution of the substrate promoted by the PTA process.
Low dilution provides coatings with a chemical composition similar to
the added metal powder, which is a prerequisite to getting improved
wear and oxidation resistance [10]. However, as dilution is decreased
by reducing process current the occurrence of defects such as lack of fu-
sion increases, which is catastrophic in terms of the behavior of molds in
service. So during coating deposition, the tendency is to increase the di-
lution of the base material even if oxidation resistance can be under-
mined. As oxidation is one of the major failure factors at high
temperature in molds for the glass industry, it is imperative to under-
stand how the different coatings provided by different process condi-
tions behave under the harsh and oxidizing atmospheres.

Technical literature reports a lot of studies on the high temperature
oxidation behavior of nickel alloys. Liu et al. [11], who studied the oxi-
dation behavior in air of a single-crystal Ni-base superalloy at 900 and
1000 °C, reported two oxidation steps for both temperatures. The first

one is controlled by NiO growth and the second by Al2O3 growth until a
continuous Al2O3 layer formed under the previously grown NiO layer. Li
et al. [12] studied the oxidation of a NiCrAlYSi overlayer with or without
a diffusion barrier deposited by one-step arc ion plating. They showed
that the duplex coating system exhibits a more effective protection for
the substrate, where thin and continuous scales are adhered to the
overlayer surface, and very limited oxidation and interdiffusion attacks
are detected. Zhou et al. [13] studied the oxidation behavior of pure and
doped nickel alloys with different Co contents in air at 960 °C. They ob-
served that increasing the Co content increases the mass oxidation gain
of the coatings.

Since oxidation is one of the main drawbacks that limit the life of
glass molds, the aim of this research is to study the effect of PTA current
variation on the oxidation behavior of coatings deposited on gray cast
iron using a nickel-based alloy. The oxidation behavior of the coatings
was studied by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The surface and
cross?section morphologies of coatings after isothermal oxidation were
observed and characterized by scanning electron microscopy provided
with energy dispersion spectrometry (SEM-EDS) and x-ray diffraction.
Further, the high temperature oxidation mechanisms are discussed.
2. Experimental procedures

Nickel based Colmonoy 215 (from Colmonoy Company) powder was
deposited by plasma transferred arc (PTA) onto specimen blocks of gray
cast iron, currently used in the production of molds for the glass indus-
try. The deposits were executed using a Commersald Group ROBO 90
machine using two different arc currents (100 and 128 amperes). The
goal of using two different arc currents was to achieve coatings with dis-
similar levels of dilution with the substrate. The nominal compositions
of the cast iron and Colmonoy 215 powder are displayed in Table 1.
The principal surfacing parameters employed are shown in Table 2. Be-
fore coating, the blocks of cast iron were induction heated at 480 °C, in
order to reduce susceptibility to cracking during coating deposition.

After coating, specimens containing cast iron and coating were re-
moved from each block for microstructural analysis. Metallographic
analysis was done using conventional procedures. Small samples for ox-
idation tests were also removed from each coating. The surfaces of these
samples were ground using number 1000 SiC abrasive paper in order to
produce even surface preparations. Further, the specimens were ultra-
sonically cleaned in alcohol.

Isothermal oxidation tests were conducted at 800 and 900 °C in air
for 2 h in a thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) machine. The air flux
used was 50 ml/min and the heating rate up to the isothermal temper-
ature was 20 °C/min. After thermal exposure the samples were cooled
naturally in air to room temperature. The weight gain of samples was
evaluated at regular 2 s intervals using a microbalance with an accuracy
of 0.01 mg. After oxidation the surface morphology of specimens was

examined by scanning electron microscopy with x-ray spectroscopy
(SEM-EDS). Further, the same equipment was used to identify the layers
forming the oxide scale from the cross?section of samples. In this case
the specimens were mounted in epoxy resin, polished and then surfaced
with a thin layer of gold for perfect observation. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
using Co K? radiation was conducted on the oxidized surface of speci-
mens. In order to ensure the reproducibility of results, three specimens
were analyzed for each coating and set of test conditions.

3. Results

3.1. Microstructure of the as-deposited coatings

Fig. 1 displays the microstructure of the coatings deposited on the
surface of gray cast iron coupons. The coatings show dense micro-
structure without lack of fusion of the substrate, free of microcracks
and few solidification voids. Their typical microstructure consists of
dendrites of the Ni-Fe solid solution phase aligned along the direction
of heat flow. Furthermore, it displays C-flakes (dark-floret like struc-
tures) randomly distributed in the matrix. The increase in arc current
gives rise to a higher dilution of the gray cast iron, changing the orig-
inal chemical composition of the filler metal. Following the procedure
detailed in reference [9], dilutions of 28% and 54% were measured for
the coatings deposited using 100 and 128 A arc current, respectively.
These levels of dilution can explain the increase in C-flakes with in-
creasing arc current, as shown in Fig. 1. Table 3 shows the chemical
composition measured by energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS)
from an area of 400×400 ?m, from the cross?section at the middle
thickness of each coating. With this procedure it is assured that chem-
ical composition values are measured from a representative volume of
material in that zone, avoiding erroneous measurements that could
arise from point analyses of the heterogeneous microstructure. As can
be seen, the main differences in chemical composition are related to
the higher iron, carbon and silicon contents achieved with increasing
dilution. The detailed characterization of the microstructure of each
coating can be found in a previous publication by the authors [9].

3.2. Isothermal oxidation in air

The results of the thermo gravimetric analysis performed on the coat-
ings at different isothermal temperatures (800 and 900 °C) are shown in
Fig. 2a and b for the coatings deposited using 100 and 128 A arc currents,
respectively. From now on and throughout the text, the coatings depos-
ited using 100 and 128 amperes will be identified as “C100” and “C128”,
respectively. The C100 coating exhibits parabolic oxidation weight gain
as a function of time for both testing temperatures as does the C128 coat-
ing at 800 °C. On the other hand, oxidation of the C128 coating at 900 °C
starts with a linear increase in mass gain but after 1400 s it starts to

follow a parabolic path. The figures also reveals that for both oxidation
temperatures, coating C100 displays less oxidation weight gain than
coating C128. The dissimilar levels of oxidation observed in the speci-
mens can be correlated with the dilution promoted by the PTA process,
that changed their chemical composition, as shown in Table 3, which
will interfere with the oxidation process. As mentioned before, the
main differences in chemical composition of coatings are related to sili-
con, carbon and, particularly, iron content. Wallwork [14] and Ezugwu
[15] reported that if iron content is increased in nickel-based alloys, it
tends to decrease their oxidation resistance, as is the case in our study.
This behavior was attributed to a progressively higher cation diffusion
rate in the scale. Therefore, increasing the dilution of gray cast iron by in-
creasing the arc current proves to be detrimental, since the oxidation re-
sistance of coatings is reduced due to a further increase of iron content in
the coatings. Moreover, it is observed that the oxidation gain of speci-
mens increases with increasing isothermal temperature. This is an
expected effect since all diffusion phenomena ruling the oxidation pro-
cess are enhanced as the temperature is increased. In conclusion, the
thermo gravimetric results show that increasing dilution decreases the
oxidation resistance of the coatings.

3.3. X-ray diffraction

Figs. 3 and 4 show the XRD spectra found at the oxidized surface of
the coatings. The oxide products revealed differences between the two
coatings; however, in each coating the phases produced after oxidation
at 800 and 900 °C are similar, although different oxidation weight gains
were measured. According to XRD patterns, the main oxide phase sets

detected at 800 °C and 900 °C were: (i) B2O3, SiO2 and OAlB for coatings
produced with lower dilution and (ii) Fe2O3 (hematite), Fe3O4 (magne-
tite) and spinels of NiFe2O4 for higher dilution coatings. The indexation
of oxide phases of coating C128 is in agreement with the results from
the literature, where similar oxide phases were detected after thermal
exposure [16,17]. Both coatings also display a high intensity peak close
to 60°, which corresponds to the face centered cubic (Ni-Fe) solid solu-
tion (ICDD card 47?1405). Furthermore, coating C100 displays low in-
tensity XRD peaks which correspond to a Ni–Si phase, such as Ni3Si
(ICDD card 32?0699), and a Cr-boride phase Cr5B3 (ICDD card 32?
0278). All these phases are currently identified in this type of micro-
structure [9]. The large amount of iron oxide detected at the oxidized
surface of coating C128 can be attributed to the higher content of iron
in this sample. As referred to before, the higher iron content in this coat-
ing is attributed to higher dilution of the base material induced by the
use of a higher arc current. Comparing the peaks intensity of coating
C128, oxidized at 800 °C and 900 °C, the amount of oxide products
Fe3O4, Fe2O3 and NiFe2O4 increased with temperature. The NiFe2O4 spi-
nel phase (ICDD card 10?0325), identified at the oxidized surface, results
from the reaction of NiO (which was also identified as an oxide phase on
the surface of coating C128) with the Fe2O3 phase, as reported by Musi?
et al. [18]. Furthermore, B-O phases (ICDD card 06?0297 (B2O3) and
ICDD card 50?1505 (B6O)) could be identified from the XRD pattern of
coating C128.

3.4. Surface morphology

The different chemical compositions of coatings brought about by di-
lution led to the formation of different kinds of oxide scales during iso-
thermal oxidation, as shown above. The SEM surface morphologies of
the oxidized coatings at 900 °C are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 for coatings
C100 and C128, respectively. EDS examinations were conducted of the
oxidized surface of coatings to characterize their composition. Coating
C100, oxidized at 900 °C, displays two phases: a gray dark phase, identi-
fied in Fig. 5a by letter A, and an evenly distributed white phase,
indentified by letter B. A magnification of each zone is shown in Fig. 5b

and c in order to better illustrate the phases. EDS analysis reveals that the
gray phase is rich in boron and oxygen, suggesting that it is a boron
oxide, as identified by XRD analysis. A similar phase was detected by Li
and Qiu [19], and Lavrenko and Gogotsi [20] after oxidation of boron
carbide powder in air, ranging from 500 to 800 °C and, oxidation of
hot-pressed boron carbide in air up to 1500 °C, respectively. They ob-
served that even if the isothermal oxidantion temperature exceeds the
melting point of the boron trioxide (about 577 °C), after cooling it is pos-
sible detect cristaline boron oxide. According to them, at a temperature
close to 577 °C the boron oxide melts, covering the oxide surface and
serving as protective layer. Therefore, oxygen is inhibited from passing
inward and metal atoms from passing outward through the oxide
layer. Above a threshold temperature, liquid boron oxide starts to evap-
orate, but only after1000 °C does this evaporation becomes significant.
Therefore, when the oxidation temperature is below 1000 °C, during
cooling down to room temperature, it is expected that boron oxide
will solidify on top of the oxidized surface of the material. The white
phase appears associated with spalling zones and cracks. The EDS anal-
ysis shows that different phases coexist in this zone. A zone rich in
boron (see peak ID 2) and another rich in silicon (see peak ID 3) were
identified, as shown in Fig. 5c. These results matched with XRD analysis
which suggest that the main phases of the oxidized surface are boron
and silicon oxides, which are responsible for oxidation resistance of
the coating due to their protective character [17,19–21]. Moreover, a
floret-like structure appears to be frequently associated with the
white phase, as shown in Fig. 5d. The EDS results (see peak ID 4)
show that the elemental composition of this oxide is rich in aluminium.
Taking into account the XRD results it can be concluded that the main
phase of the floret-like oxide is OAlB. The morphology and indexation
of this phase named aluminum borate whiskers, matches well with
that studied in references [22,23].

However, analysis of the oxidized surface of coating C128 at 900 °C
reveals that the oxide morphology is different from that of coating
C100 (see Fig. 6a). It displays a microstructure with uniformly distribut-
ed irregular ditches and dissimilar phases. A magnification of the micro-
structure is shown in Fig. 6b to make this clearer and more easily
characterized. The EDS analysis reveals that the phase with irregular
ditches (peak ID 1) is rich in iron and oxygen, suggesting an iron
oxide, as identified in the XRD pattern. Further XRD analysis revealed
that the oxidized surface is composed primarily of Fe2O3 with small
amounts of Fe3O4. This result is in agreement with that of Guo et al.
[16]. It is possible to identify other small features such as another
phase rich in iron (see peak ID 2 relating to the angular particles) for
which EDS analysis shows the presence of nickel. The combination of
Ni with the Fe2O3 phase can give rise to NiFe2O4 spinels which were
also identified by XRD. Furthermore, particles of carbon (dark phase)
could be detected at the oxidized surface of the coating, as shown by
peak ID 3. Finally a phase rich in nickel, oxygen, carbon, silicon and
boron (see peak ID 4) was detected at the oxidized surface of coating
128 A explaining the Ni–O, and B–O phases identified in the XRD
pattern of the specimen.

3.5. Cross?section of oxidized samples

The microstructures of cross-sections of the oxide scale of coatings
C100 and C128, after oxidation and testing at 900 °C for 2 h, are pres-
ented in Figs. 7a and b, respectively. The oxide scale is about 5 ?m
thick for the specimen coated using the lower arc current and 10 ?m
thick for that using the higher current. Decarburization of coating
C128 close to the surface is also revealed. Comparing this cross?section
with the oxide scale of the same coating oxidized at 800 °C (Fig. 8) it is
possible to conclude that at this temperature there is no decarburization
of the specimen. Zones of silicon segregation were found near the inter-
face in both coatings (C100 and C128) annealed at either temperature,
as shown, as an example, by the EDS analysis performed on the phase
marked with number 1 in Fig. 7c for coating C128 oxidized at 900 °C.

The structure of the oxide scale will be discussed separately for each
coating, in order to more clearly illustrate its composition and the role of
thermodynamic stability and transport mechanisms in the establish-
ment of layered structures.

Fig. 9 shows SEM images in secondary and backscattered electrons of
cross?sections of the oxide scales of coatings C100 and C128 at 900 °C.
The oxide layers are complex and composed of a mixture of phases.
EDS analyses were conducted on the cross?section of the oxide scales,
in order to characterize the different oxides formed during isothermal
oxidation. Table 4 summarizes the EDS analyses performed at the points
marked in the figures. The values plotted in this table indicate the ratio
between the peak intensity of each element with the peak intensity of
oxygen for each EDS spectrum. This means that at each point analyzed,
a relative increase in this ratio for one particular element is a result of
the preferential formation of the oxide of that element over the others.
Combining SEM images with EDS results, plotted in Table 4 it can be con-
cluded that the oxide scale of coating C100 is mainly composed of silicon
oxide (as the phase identified with point 1 suggests), with small
amounts of a dark phase rich in nickel, silicon, aluminum and boron
(see phase identified with point 2) uniformly distributed through the
layer. This agrees well with the XRD pattern and the indexed Si-O,
Ni-Si and O-Al-B phases detected. In addition, it is possible to identify a
phase rich in boron, normally located at the top of the oxidized surface
(point 3), suggesting a boron oxide, as also revealed by XRD. Moreover,
a Ni-rich white phase (see point 4) appears at the interface between
the coating and the oxide layer, corresponding to the remaining part of

image of Fig.?4

the original source of elements which diffused outwards to form oxide
scales.

The oxide scale of coating C128 is different from that of coating C100,
being composed of two layers. Combining the XRD analysis, with the
SEM-EDS results, the external layer can be identified as Fe2O3, the main
phase containing small features of Fe3O4 and spinel NiFe2O4. On the
other hand, the internal layer is composed of a continuous Fe–O rich
phase (phase identified with point 2) with small evenly distributed
amounts of a dark oxide rich in silicon, nickel and iron, as point 3 of
EDS analysis shows. The lower iron content in the internal layer in rela-
tion to the external one suggests that the internal Fe–O rich phase re-
spects the Fe3O4 oxide. This result is coherent with the oxidation of
Fe-based materials and so hematite (Fe2O3) and spinel of NiFe2O4 can
be expected to form in the region of higher oxygen potential while mag-
netite (Fe3O4) will form in the lower oxygen potential region [24]. Simi-
lar iron oxide layers were observed by Guo et al., after oxidation of Fe–
36% Ni bicrystals in air at high temperature [16]. Between these outer
and inner layers, a continuous thin layer of a dark phase appears at the
interface, as revealed by SEM. A boron rich phase could be detected at
the top of the outer layer (see point 4), which is in good agreement
with the boron oxide detected by XRD. Finally, clusters of carbon are dis-
tributed evenly in the oxide layers. The accumulation of C at the interface

tified in A), D) magnification of the zone C identified in C). SEM/EDS spectra of: E) zone 1,
between the coating and the oxide scale (point 5) is a consequence of the
oxide layer serving as a diffusion barrier for C coming from the decarburi-
zation of the sample mentioned above. Analogous oxide products were
observed in the cross?sections of the oxide scale of coating C128 oxidized
at 800 °C.

A good correlation was found between the scale microstructure and
the isothermal oxidation curve of coating C100 oxidized at 900 °C. The
oxidation kinetics of metals and alloys is often controlled by a parabolic
rate law at high temperature [25] due to the presence of protective scales.
This may well be the case in this specimen, as the evolution of the oxida-
tion weight gain is controlled by the silicon oxide, the main phase present
in the oxide scale, as suggested by Fig. 9. At lower temperatures, a boron
oxide starts forming on the surface of the specimen due to the high affin-
ity of boron to oxygen. However, for higher temperatures, due to the in-
tense segregation of silicon through the interface and its great affinity for
oxygen, a silicon oxide layer starts to be formed beneath the boron oxide.
At the same time small amounts of Ni–Si and O–Al–B phases are formed
due to the diffusion of other elements through the interface. At a temper-
ature of approximately 577 °C, boron oxide melts, covering the oxidized
surface of the coating and inhibiting the transport of species though the
melted oxide layer. Above this temperature it is expected that melted
B2O3 starts to evaporate: however, this vaporization does not

significantly influence the slope of the kinetics curve at 800 and 900 °C,
since it only has an important impact at temperatures above 1000 °C
[19,20]. Finally, due to the continuous segregation of silicon, its oxide
layer will progressively thicken. A protective layer was therefore
established and the reaction rate becomes governed by the rate of species
diffusion through this thicker silicon oxide layer, as observed in the cross?
section of the oxide scale of the specimen. As with coating C100, a strong
correlation can be found between the microstructure of the oxide scale
and the isothermal oxidation curve of coating C128. At 800 °C, parabolic
behavior is displayed; however, at 900 °C, two steps can be detected, see
Fig. 2b. The isothermal oxidation curve at first exhibits a linear increase in
mass gain and then starts to conform to a parabolic law. The microstruc-
tural analysis of the cross-section of the oxide scale revealed that at
800 °C there is no decarburization of the coating, which is not what
was observed at 900 °C. Like the specimen coated using the lower arc
current, at low temperatures boron oxide starts forming on the surface
of specimen due to the high affinity of boron to oxygen. Moreover, for
high temperatures, due to the high iron content, a consistent layer of
Fe2O3 with small features of Fe3O4 and NiFe2O4 is formed, which is thick-
ened by outward Fe diffusion. At the same time the specimen loses car-
bon by decarburization, due to the formation of CO2. However, carbon

has increasing difficulties diffusing outwards through the oxide layer and
stays either inside or beneath the oxide scale, as shown by morphological
analysis of the cross-section. Therefore, after the first step where the
weight gain is partially compensated by C liberation, the oxidation
curve will deviate to a normal parabolic trend. According to the
Richardson-Ellingham diagram, Si has higher affinity for O than Ni and
Fe, and Fe forms Fe3O4 more easily than Ni forms NiO. Therefore, during
oxidation it would be expected that Si-O would be the first layer to be
formed. However, its much lower content in the specimen relative to
iron, indicates that considerable time is required to form a continuous
and protective SiO2 layer, as suggested by Douglass and Armijo [26]. So,
after a critical time a layer of SiO2 starts being formed below the Fe2O3
scale, but it never becomes thick enough to determine the oxidation ki-
netics. Further, due to the continuous segregation of iron through the sur-
face of the specimen and due to the decrease in oxygen content at the
coating's surface as a result of the volume growth of the Fe2O3 layer, a
continuous and consistent Fe3O4 layer starts forming in this zone, with
small uniformly distributed amounts of the dark phase.

4. Conclusion

This investigation concerned the effect of PTA current variation
on the oxidation behavior in air at 800 and 900 °C of coatings of a
nickel-based hardfacing alloy deposited on gray cast iron using two dif-
ferent arc currents (100 and 128 A). Samples were analyzed by thermal
gravimetric analysis, x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron mi-
croscopy with energy dispersion spectrometry analysis (SEM-EDS). The
thermo gravimetric results show that increasing the arc current from
100 to 128 A decreases the oxidation resistance of coatings, a result
that can be correlated with the different chemical compositions of the
coatings, promoted by different dilutions of the base material. The
coating with lower dilution follows a parabolic oxidation weight gain
as a function of time, as this behaviour is essentially controlled by the
growth of a Si–O layer. The coating with higher dilution follows the
same trend at 800 °C. However, at 900 °C two stages in the oxidation
curve were detected, the first with a linear increase in mass gain, a com-
promise between outward Fe diffusion through a growing layer of
Fe2O3 and the loss of carbon by decarburization and formation of CO2.
The second step obeys a parabolic law from the moment that C libera-
tion is impeded by a thickened scale consisting of an external Fe2O3
phase, with small amounts of Fe3O4 and NiFe2O4 spinel rich film, and
an internal layer of Fe3O4 film with small evenly distributed amounts
of a dark phase rich in silicon, nickel and iron. In summary, an increase
in arc current from 100 to 128 A in the deposition of nickel-rich layers
on substrates of cast iron by the PTA process is very harmful, as it
reduces the oxidation resistance of the coatings at high temperature.

Abstract: The moulds for the production of glass bottles, made of cast iron, are 
subjected to very severe conditions of wear during use. Thus, it is essential to 
understand the wear mechanisms involved, in order to increase the equipment 
life. The present study intends to study the abrasion resistance of moulds 
submitted for long time at working conditions. The investigation was 
conducted on nickel-based coatings deposited by plasma transferred arc (PTA) 
on grey cast iron, using different arc currents. Micro-scale ball cratering 
abrasive wear test was used to evaluate the tribological properties of the  
as-deposited and heat treated coatings. The results show that micro-scale 
abrasion tests induce grooving and pitting wear mechanisms. Increasing the arc 
current decreased the hardness of the coatings and, consequently, their wear 
resistance. The hardness and wear resistance of the coatings was improved by 
increasing heat treatment holding time.

1 Introduction 

Cast iron is commonly used in the production of moulds and accessories for glass 
industry. Wear and oxidation are the main failure mechanisms that limit the surface life 
of moulds (Cingi et al., 2002). Therefore, it is necessary to protect mould surfaces with 
hard and wear resistant materials. 

The plasma transferred arc (PTA) process has been usually applied to coat the 
surfaces of moulds and, especially, their edges where the wear is higher. It produces very 
high quality deposits, offering optimal protection with minimal thermal distortion of the 
parts, and provides high deposition rate (Gatto et al., 2004). It allows very precise deposit 
layers of complex alloys on mechanical parts that are subjected to harsh environments, 
significantly extending their service life (Siva et al., 2009). However, the hardness and 
the wear resistance of the coatings are strongly influenced by the dilution of the substrate 
promoted by the PTA process. Low dilution provides coatings with similar chemical 
composition to the metal powder added, condition to have an improved wear and

corrosion resistance (Balasubramanian et al., 2009). Therefore, it is essential to control 
the relevant process parameters to minimise the dilution. 

A significant number of coating materials, such as cobalt, iron and nickel alloys, can 
be applied by PTA process to extend the working life of tribological components 
subjected to wear. In glass industry nickel alloys gain extremely important role in 
protection of surfaces, due to their excellent performance under conditions of abrasion 
and corrosion at elevated temperature. The microstructure and wear behaviour of  
nickel-based hard-facing alloy deposits have been studied using various alloy 
compositions and different substrates. Nickel-based alloys are usually strengthened by 
alloying elements which improve their wear properties (Ezugwu et al., 1998; Chang  
et al., 2010). Technical literature reports a lot of tribological studies done by pin-on-disc 
tests in deposits of Ni alloys on stainless and carbon steels, though the sliding contact 
conditions of pin-on-disc do not reproduce the interaction conditions between melted 
glass and the surface of the mould. Because of that, the ball cratering wear test was 
selected as the first step to investigate the micro-abrasion resistance of the coatings at 
room temperature. 

Guo et al. (2011) studied the high temperature wear resistance and wear mechanism 
of NiCrBSi and NiCrBSi/WC-Ni coatings deposited on stainless steel by laser cladding. 
They found that the wear resistance of the coatings is much greater than that of stainless 
steel when sliding against Si3N4 counterpart ball. Furthermore, NiCrBSi/WC-Ni 
composite coating showed better wear resistance at high temperature than NiCrBSi 
coating. Kesavan and Kamaj (2010), who worked with a Colmomoy 5 hard-facing alloy 
deposited by PTA on a stainless steel, studied the room and high temperature wear 
behaviour using pin-on-disc wear tests. They showed that the wear resistance of the 
coatings improved significantly with increasing test temperature. Further, they observed 
different operating wear mechanisms depending on the sliding and testing temperature. In 
turn, Gurumoorthy et al. (2007) studied the sliding wear of a nickel hard-facing alloy 
AWS NiCr-B deposited on the same stainless steel at three different temperatures  
(room temperature, 300°C and 500°C), and the influence of an ageing treatment on its 
microstructure, hardness and wear behaviour. The investigation revealed a significant 
weight loss at room temperature and an abrupt decrease in mass loss at high temperature. 
However, after ageing treatment they demonstrated that there is no significant change in 
the weight loss or the wear behaviour at room and high temperature. 

Since wear and oxidation are the main drawbacks that limit the surface life of glass 
moulds, the aim of this research is to study the effect of PTA current on the 
microstructure, hardness and three-body abrasion behaviour of a nickel-based hard-facing 
alloy coating deposited on grey cast iron. Ageing studies were also conducted to evaluate 
the influence of temperature holding time on the microstructure, hardness and tribological 
properties of the coating processed with the highest current. 

2 Experimental procedure 

A nickel-based hard-facing alloy named Colmonoy 215 (from Colmonoy Company) was 
deposited on flat surfaces of grey cast iron blocks by PTA process. Before coating, each 
cast iron block was preheated at 480°C, in order to reduce the thermal shock and cooling 
rate to avoid cracks in both the coating and heat-affected zone. The same process

parameters were used for all coatings except arc current, which was 100 A for  
specimen 1, 128 A for specimen 2 and 140 A for specimen 3. The composition of cast 
iron and metal powder is given in Table 1 and the process parameters used in Table 2. 
After coating, the blocks were left to cool to room temperature. Samples were removed 
from each block, transversely to welding direction, for further analysis. Ageing studies 
were carried out at 500°C for 5, 10 and 20 days on specimen 3.

Microstructural analysis was done in cross section of the samples. Optical and scanning 
electron microscopies (OM and SEM) were used to characterise the microstructure of the 
coatings. Vickers micro-hardness profiles were measured in the cross section of treated 
samples using a load of 5 N. 

Micro abrasive wear tests were carried out in as-deposited and heat treated surfaces at 
room temperature in a ball cratering devices. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the 
equipment used. In this test a specific normal load is applied to press a rotating ball into 
the flat surface of the coated sample in the presence of a slurry suspension of abrasive. 
The abrasive slurry, agitated by a magnetic stirrer, was continuous and gravitationally 
drip fed onto the rotating ball to produce a spherical cup depression. Preliminary tests 
using different contact conditions were done to reproduce the interaction conditions in the 
surface of the moulds which have been in service for a long time. The wear mechanism 
was studied by SEM. High purity silica SS40 with angular particles of averaging of  
3.10 ?m in size was used as an abrasive to replicate the effect of the melted glass. The 
slurry used was prepared with a concentration of 103 g per 1 × 10–4 m3 of distilled water. 
A steel ball bearing (AISI 52100) with 0.0254 m was used. Several scars were made in 
each sample with different durations, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 turns, respectively 7.98, 
15.96, 23.94, 31.92, 39.90 meters of sliding distance for all the specimens, under the 
action of a normal load of 0.1 N. In order to minimise the scatter of results, previously to 
starting the tests, the ball surface was etched with chloridric acid (33%) during ten

minutes. The dimensions of spherical depressions were measured in order to calculate the 
wear volume, which is given by the equation (1). In this equation, R represents the ball 
radius and b the crater chordal diameter of the spherical cup depression. The b value was 
evaluated using the average of two perpendicular measurements performed at the wear 
scar chordal diameter. Those values were measured with a Mitutoyo Toolmaker 
Microscope with x-y micrometer table.

In order to obtain the specific wear rate, to quantify the wear behaviour, Archard’s law 
was applied, see equation (2). This is the most applied law to determine a parameter to 
quantify the wear behaviour of materials. In this equation, P is the normal load, l is the 
sliding distance and k is the specific wear rate.

To quantify the specific wear rate a linear approach of Archard’s model was applied and 
a statistical analysis was used to estimate the error of measurements, as described 
elsewhere (Ramalho, 2010).

3 Results 

3.1 Microstructure 

Figure 2 shows the microstructure of the coatings performed using different arc currents 
[Figures 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c)], as well as the fusion boundary of specimen 3 [Figure 2(d)], 
and SEM pictures of specimen 3 before and after heat treatment [Figures 2 (e) and 2(f)]. 
The typical microstructure of deposits consists of dendrites of Ni-Fe solid solution phase 
with columnar morphology oriented along the direction of heat flow, with C-flakes (dark 
floret-like structures) randomly distributed. However, near the interface it was observed 
the presence of a cellular microstructure finer than the dendrite structure with diminution 
of the size of C-flakes, as illustrated in Figure 2(d) for specimen 3. This behaviour could 
be explained by the higher solidification rates involved in the boundary because of the

efficient thermal exchange ensured by the high volume ratio substrate/coating of the  
base material, as suggested by Gatto et al. (2004) and Navas et al. (2006). Moreover, the 
presence of the ‘dark’ phase on the coatings cannot be explained by the chemical 
composition of the metal powder added, so it can be only attributed to the high dilution of 
cast iron induced by the PTA process. The dilution was evaluated by the ratio between 
the area of the melted base material and the total area of the melted zone, both measured 
in the cross section of the coatings. Dilutions of 28%, 50% and 59% were measured 
respectively for specimen 1, 2 and 3. These results agree with the observed increasing 
proportion of C-flakes for higher arc currents, as can be seen in Figures 2(a), 2(b) and 
2(c). Therefore, the chemical composition of the coatings is largely influenced by the 
dilution of cast iron. A detailed characterisation of this type of coatings can be found in a 
previous publication of the authors (Fernandes et al., 2011).

Table 3 shows the chemical composition in area measured by SEM-EDS at various zones 
on the coating and the substrate of specimen 3. Zone 1 and 2 are located close to the 
coating surface, zone 3 at the mid-thickness of the coating, zone 4 in the coating close to 
the fusion boundary and zone 5 in the bulk cast iron. This analysis showed that PTA 
process promotes an evenly distribution of the elements inside the coating. The same 
observation was done in specimens 1 and 2. Due to the dilution, the amount of iron in the

coating increases reducing its nickel content. Ezugwu et al. (1998) reported that the 
increase of iron content in the coatings tends to decrease their oxidation resistance, 
because of the formation of a less adherent oxide scale. 

Figures 2(e) and 2(f) reveals that the heat treatment induces significant changes in the 
original microstructure of specimen 3. It promotes the formation of a white phase on the 
grain boundaries. Magnifications of the two microstructures are shown in Figure 3.  
SEM-EDS spectra analyses were conducted on the coatings to give a detailed 
characterisation of their microstructure. From the EDS analysis, it can be stated that the 
grain boundaries of the non-heat-treated sample is formed by two phases: a light grey  
and a dark grey rich in chromium and silicon, respectively. Inversely, the specimen  
in heat-treated condition is formed by the light grey phase as observed in the  
non-heat-treated sample and a new phase (white phase) which is replacing the dark phase. 
The amount of the white phase grows with increasing time of heat treatment. According 
to Fernandes et al. (2011), who studied a nickel alloy deposited on grey cast iron, the 
dark grey phase is a Ni3Si phase. The EDS spectrum reveals that both phases (the dark 
and the white) are rich in Ni-Si. However, the white phase presents a higher content of 
phosphorous on the heat treated sample suggesting a dispersion of Ni-P precipitates on 
the grain boundaries, as observed by Sahoo and Das (2011) in electroless nickel coatings.

before and after heat treatment (see online version for colours)

3.2 Hardness 

The micro-hardness profiles of the different as-deposited and heat treated specimens are 
shown respectively in Figures 4(a) and 4(b). Figure 4(a) reveals that the hardness through 
the coatings is approximately constant and tends to decrease with increasing arc current. 
The dilution induced by the PTA process can explain this behaviour. The partial melted 
zone (PMZ) displays the highest hardness. According to Pouranvari (2010), who studied 
the weldability of grey cast iron using nickel-based filler metals, the highest hardness 
observed in PMZ is due to the formation of hard and brittle phases during surfacing, such 
as martensite and white cast iron. The heat treatment promotes the progressive hardening 
of the coatings with increasing thermal exposure time [see Figure 4(b)]. Some scatter of 
the hardness values can be observed too. Harsha et al. (2008), who studied the influence 
of CrC in a nickel flame sprayed coatings, observed similar behaviour. According to 
them, the scatter in the values is due to the presence of a harder eutectic network around 
the cells. As described before, heat treatment promotes the formation of Ni-P precipitates

on the grain boundaries. The greater hardness observed on the ageing treated samples can 
be attributed to the presence of these precipitates similarly to what is currently observed 
in Ni-P electroless coating when annealed at increasing temperatures (Sahoo and Das, 
2011). This type of coatings is a supersaturated alloy in the as-deposited state and can be 
strengthened by the precipitation of nickel phosphide crystallites. The phosphides act as 
barriers for dislocation movement and improve the mechanical strength of the coatings. 

3.3 Wear behaviour of coatings 

Micro-scale abrasion tests were performed on the coatings at room temperature to predict 
the effect of the different process parameters on their wear behaviour. The goal in a first 
step was to study the abrasion resistance present in the surface of in-service moulds, in 
order to quantify the wear loss of coatings. The response of materials under micro 
abrasion tests depends on the nature of the motion of particles in the contact zone, which 
determines the stress state arising near the contact. Three-body wear mechanism  
(rolling or pitting) and two-body wear mechanism (grooving), or a combination of both 
mechanisms could be detected. Rolling occurs when the abrasive particles are able to free 
rotate between the sphere and the material in test; on the other hand, grooving occurs if 
the particles follow the rotation of the sphere, scratching the specimen surface (Ramalho 
et al., 2011; Gant and Gee, 2011). In spite of this general tendency to the occurrence of 
three-body or two-body abrasion, the characteristics of the materials will influence the 
process; mild materials will stabilise the grooving mode.

distance’ of (a) as-deposited coatings and (b) specimen 3 before and after thermo 
exposure at 500°C during several days (see online version for colours) 

  
(a)     (b) 

The results of the micro-scale abrasion tests from specimens in as-deposited and heat 
treaded conditions are plotted respectively in Figures 5(a) and 5(b), as the material 
volume loss as a function of the product of the sliding distance (l) by the normal load (P). 
The reliability analysis of the data is presented in Table 4 and the confidence interval for 
the specific wear rate plotted in Figure 6. For each sample, a straight linear trend was 
fitted to the experimental points in order to obtain the specific wear rate, which 
corresponds to its slope [see equation (2)]. From Figure 5(a), it is possible to conclude 
that specimen 1 exhibits slightly lower specific wear rate, therefore it is the more resistant 
to wear. This result is in accordance with its greater hardness when compared to the  
others as-deposited coatings. Specimens 2 and 3 displays similar wear volumes, which is

again attributed to their similar hardness profiles. Figure 5(b) reveals that specimens 
exposed during five and ten days at 500°C displayed similar specific wear rate to the  
non-heat-treated specimen. However, the specimen exposed during 20 days exhibits 
lower specific wear rate, therefore, it is the most resistant to wear. This last result is again 
in accordance with the higher hardness of this sample after the heat treatment.

In order to identify the wear mechanisms and to compare the worn surfaces with those 
observed in the surface of moulds, SEM examinations were carried out. Figure 7(a) 
displays a SEM micrograph of the surface of a coating of a mould after long time in 
service. From this picture is possible to see that the surface failure regions display pits 
and cracks. Considering the in-service conditions the surface damage probably was 
induced by synergetic effects of several mechanisms, namely thermal fatigue, corrosion 
and abrasion. However, pitting is the main active failure mechanism of the moulds. 
Figures 7(b) and 7(c) illustrates spherical cup depressions induced by the micro-scale 
abrasion tests on the specimen 3, before and after holding time for 20 days, produced 
after 500 ball rotations. Both scars display similar wear behaviour with two modes of 
wear: three-body abrasion (pitting) and two-body abrasion (grooving). The two-body 
abrasion mode is preferentially localised in the area of higher pressure (input slurry area)

and three-body abrasion mode is localised in the area of less pressure. Figure 8 shows 
these two modes of wear at higher magnification. The same wear mechanisms were 
observed in the other specimens in as-deposit and heat treated conditions. Although the 
scars displayed two modes of wear it can be stated that the region corresponding to  
three-body mode reproduces closely the wear mechanism present in the moulds surface. 
However, one should keep in mind that these results do not reproduce with accuracy the 
in-service condition of the moulds, since in service they are exposed to other damage 
mechanisms such as thermal and mechanical fatigue, oxidation and corrosion at high 
temperature.

4 Conclusions 

Micro-scale abrasion testing was used to study the interaction conditions between melted 
glass and the surface of the moulds. The influence of the arc current used in PTA process, 
as well as the effect of heat treatments, on the microstructure, hardness and wear 
resistance of the coatings was analysed. The increase in arc current increased the dilution 
of the base material changing the composition and microstructure of the deposits and 
reducing their hardness. Furthermore, the wear loss of material increased with increasing 
arc current. The micro-scale abrasion tests displayed two modes of wear: three-body 
abrasion (pitting) and two-body abrasion (grooving). Although the scars displayed two 
modes of wear it can be stated that the wear mechanism of the abrasion test reproduces 
with success the wear mechanism present in the moulds surface. The heat treatment 
performed on the sample 3 promotes increasing hardness of the coating with thermal 
exposure time. The enhanced hardness of the coatings is partially attributed to Ni-P 
precipitates on the grain boundaries. Specimen 3 heat treated for 20 days showed the best 
resistance to wear. 

Future experiments will be devoted to study the high temperature abrasion resistance 
of the coatings, in order to reproduce the in service conditions of moulds.

Micro-scale abrasion was used to characterize abrasion resistance of a nickel-based hardfacing alloy

deposited by Plasma Transferred Arc on gray cast iron using silica as abrasive agent. In order to

investigate the occurrence of different abrasion mechanisms, several test conditions were used,

namely: different silica abrasive contents and a range of normal loads and test durations. A scanning

electron microscope (SEM) was used to study the morphologies of the spherical cup-shaped depres-

sions induced by different test conditions. The results are discussed in terms of the effect of the

dominant wear mechanisms on the abrasion resistance and the influence of the test conditions on the

mechanism transition. The wear results lead to the conclusion that the specific wear rate essentially

depends on the wear mechanisms (rolling or grooving) involved and not on the tests conditions

employed, since these do not produce changes in the wear mechanism.

1. Introduction

The micro-scale abrasion wear test is a suitable experimental
method for evaluating and comparing the abrasive wear perfor-
mance of a wide variety of materials. This technique has been
successfully applied to characterize metallic and non-metallic,
bulk and coating materials, under the influence of a wide diversity
of abrasive slurries [1,2]. It is well known that in the industry, the
main wear problems in components are related to abrasion,
which could co-exist, whether associated or not, with other forms
of wear, such as adhesion or tribo-corrosion [3–5]. The usefulness
of the laboratory characterization depends on the ability of the
test conditions to reproduce real working conditions as closely as
possible.

In the micro-scale abrasion test, three distinct wear modes
have been identified, three-body or rolling abrasion, two-body or
grooving abrasion and the ridging wear mechanism [1,2,5–8].
Additionally transitions between these wear modes could be
observed (rolling to grooving, grooving to ridging and ridging to
rolling); these are referred to as ‘‘mixed-mode’’ wear mechan-
isms. Rolling abrasion is characterized by a hertzian type contact
which occurs when the abrasive particles are able to freely rotate
between the sphere and the material in test, producing multiple
indentations, while grooving occurs if the particles remain fixed
to the sphere and scratch the specimen surface. On the other

nandes).
hand, ridging wear mechanism is produced when the abrasive
particles disappear in the contact region, the contact being made
directly between the sphere and the specimen tested. Therefore,
the ridging wear mode should be considered as transition from
abrasion to metal–metal sliding. Furthermore, according to some
authors [8,9], associated with the complex regimes above men-
tioned, tribo-chemical interactions must be taken into account in
the wear calculations specially at high applied loads. This phe-
nomenon is known to enhance wear resistance with an increase
in applied load due to oxide formation on the surface.

In order to use micro-abrasion tests to evaluate the abrasive
wear resistance of a system, either three-body or two-body
abrasions need to be considered in the study; each wear mode
is characterized by significantly different values of specific wear
rate, which can differ by more than one order of magnitude [1,10].
Some authors stated that, in micro-scale abrasion tests, the rolling
abrasion wear mode leads to results that are more easily repro-
duced [11,12]. Williams and Hyncica [13,14] discussed the pos-
sibility of applying the continuum mechanics abrasion model to
explain the wear transitions. They verified that the quantitative
models can be only applied to processes or materials where the
boundary conditions are well established, which is not the case
for the micro-scale abrasion test. Nevertheless, Williams and
Hyncica suggested that the transition from rolling to grooving
must be a function of the critical thickness of the abrasive slurry
in the contact. Following this suggestion, Adachi and Hutchings
[6] used an indentation model to analyze the grooving wear
conditions and they proposed a dimensionless parameter for
the severity of contact (S0), to be correlated with the transition

conditions. The ratio of hardnesses between the specimen and the
ball, Hs/Hb, was identified as the key parameter in the transition
from three-body to two-body abrasion. The results showed that
with increasing severity of contact (S0) a transition from uniform
three-body to two-body abrasion occurs through a mixed three
and two body abrasion regime.

The technical literature reports several studies undertaken
using micro-scale abrasion equipment and describes how the
dissimilar test conditions (volume fraction of abrasive in the
slurry, abrasive material, applied load, ball and specimen materi-
als, sliding distance and surface condition of the ball) influence
the dominant wear modes of different materials [1,6,10,15–18].
The main objective of these studies is to track the dominant wear
modes created with different conditions to produce an associate
wear-mode map, to serve as data to predict the conditions to
ensure either three-body or two-body abrasion. With regard to
the type of abrasive material to be used in micro-scale abrasion
tests, the BS-EN 1071-6: 2007 standard recommends the use of
SiC F1200 abrasive; however, dissimilar abrasive materials with
different grain sizes have been used and, normally, the studies
also report the use of diamond and Al2O3. It has been shown that
the relative wear rates of the materials depended strongly upon
the abrasive type selected (abrasive shape and hardness) [19].
Nevertheless, there are few references regarding the use of silica
as abrasive material. Because silica is the most common abrasive
material, therefore responsible for the majority of practical abra-
sion problems, it is important to study the test conditions which
produce different wear mechanisms using silica abrasive slurry.

Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to study the test
conditions which produce rolling and grooving wear modes with
silica slurry. An associate wear mode-map should be produced to
use as data to ensure either one or the other abrasion wear
mechanism’s intended further aim was to show that the specific
wear rate essentially depends on the wear mechanisms (rolling or
grooving) involved and not on the test conditions employed, since
these do not produce changes in the wear mechanism. The wear
tests were conducted in fixed ball equipment on a nickel-based
hardfacing alloy coating deposited by PTA – Plasma Transferred
Arc on gray cast iron. Regimes of wear behavior were identified by
scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the results were ana-
lyzed with a focus on the effects of wear mechanisms.
2. Experimental procedure

In this study, micro-scale abrasion equipment was used to
study the influence of the test conditions on the dominant wear
modes of a nickel-based hardfacing coating. The coating analyzed
was produced by plasma transferred arc process (PTA) on a flat
surface of gray cast iron using a 128 A arc current. Fig. 1 shows
the typical microstructure of the as-deposited coating. As can be
observed, the coating has a relatively dense microstructure, free
of microcracks and few solidification voids with dendrites of
Ni–Fe solid solution phase aligned along the direction of heat
flow. Furthermore, it displays C-flakes (dark-floret like structures)
randomly distributed in the matrix. The chemical composition of
the materials, the conditions and the procedure adopted for the
deposition and the characterization of the coatings as well as their
main physical structural and mechanical properties can be found
in a previous publication of the authors [20].

Fig. 2 represents a schematic diagram of the micro-abrasive
wear equipment (fixed ball equipment). In this device, a specific
normal load is applied to press a rotating ball (located between
two-coaxial shafts) into the surface of the coated specimen
(placed in a pivoted specimen holder) in the presence of a specific
abrasive slurry. The abrasive slurry was continuously agitated by
a magnetic stirrer and dropped steadily onto the rotating ball to
produce a spherical cup depression. In this investigation, high
purity silica from Lusosilica, Lda (Portugal) company, with an
average particle size of 3.1 mm and hardness around 1000 HV was
used as abrasive to produce spherical cup depressions in the flat
surface of the coated sample. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the silica
particles are highly irregular and angular. The particle size
distribution is plotted in Fig. 3(b). The slurry was prepared with
different silica contents (25, 50 and 65 vol%) in distilled water. An
AISI 52100 steel ball bearing, 25.4 mm in diameter and with a
hardness of approximately 740 HV, was used as the counterpart
to produce wear scars in the sample surface. The specimen tested
has a hardness of approximately 225 HV. The rotation speed of
the ball was kept at 75 rpm (0.1 m/s of tangential speed) in all the
tests. The coating was tested using three different normal load
values (0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 N) and five test durations (50, 80, 150, 200
and 300 rpm), respectively 4, 6.4, 12, 16 and 24 m of sliding
distance. The test conditions are summarized in Table 1.

In order to produce an evenly prepared surface, the specimen
was polished with SiC abrasive paper up to 1000 grit before wear
tests. A new ball was used in the abrasion tests. The ball’s surface
was prepared using the run-in procedure described by Gee et al.
[21], and the orientation of the ball was changed randomly before
each test. Following the tests, the wear scars were examined by a
scanning electron microscope (SEM), in order to discriminate the
dissimilar wear modes. Abrasion maps of the material volume
loss as function of the sliding distance were plotted for each value
of normal load used. The results were discussed in terms of either
the tribological properties or the dominant wear mechanisms
involved. The material wear volume was calculated by using Eq. (1).
In this equation b represents the crater chordal diameter of the

spherical cup depression produced and R is the ball radius used. The
b value was calculated using the average of two perpendicular
measurements performed at the wear scar chordal diameter, with
the help of a Mitutoyo Toolmaker Microscope with x–y micrometer
table. All the data was then collected in a single graph, and
represented as function of the volume loss, with the product
between the sliding distance and the normal load, to identify the
conditions that produce similar wear mechanisms. To quantify the
specific wear rate of the material a linear approach to Archard’s law
was used. This law is given by Eq. (2). In this equation V represents
the wear volume, k is the specific wear rate, N is the normal applied
load and x is the sliding distance. Moreover, a statistical analysis was
applied to estimate the error of measurements, as described else-
where [22].

Eq. (1) allows the approximate calculation of the wear volume
of a spherical cup depression, with an implied assumption that
the wear scar has a spherical geometry conforming to that of the
ball bearing used. In order to elucidate users, an analysis of the
error of Eq. (1) is given in Appendix A. Moreover, a correction
factor is proposed to enhance the accuracy of this equation. The
analysis carried out in Appendix A, showed that for b/R values up
to 0.35 the equation assures an error lower than 1%.
3. Results

The micro-scale abrasion results for the different test condi-
tions are shown in Fig. 4. Each graph plots the volume loss (V) as
function of the sliding distance (x), for each normal load. The
results of the tests performed with the lowest load (see Fig. 4(a))
reveal that there are no effective changes in the wear volume with
the change in the concentration of abrasive slurry, especially for
the scar produced with low sliding distance. Inversely, for the
highest load (see Fig. 4(c)), the results show that the material
volume loss increases with increasing concentration of abrasive
and the difference is sharper for higher sliding distances. The tests
conducted with an intermediary load (see Fig. 4(b)), displayed
mixed behavior. The scars produced with the lowest concentra-
tion of abrasive slurry showed lower wear volume than those
produced with higher concentrations of abrasive slurry (50% and
65% in volume), which displayed similar values of material
volume loss. Moreover, it is observed that the wear volume



F. Fernandes et al. / Wear 292–293 (2012) 151–158154
stabilizes with increasing sliding distance, whatever the concen-
tration of abrasive used. This behavior could be associated with
two effects: the running-in effect [23] and the variation of the
contact area/wear volume ratio throughout the duration of the
test. According to Blau [23], the running-in behavior is the net
result of simultaneous transitional processes occurring within the
interface, which may lead to non-linear evolution of the wear for
short sliding distances. Furthermore, at the start of the wear tests
(with very small craters, consequently with small amounts of the
radius of the spherical depression) it is well known that the area
of the crater grows much faster than the volume; at that point,
the rate of pressure reduction is greater than the rate of change in
the volume, which may also justify the reduction in wear rate. In
fact, the severity of contact index, proposed by Adachi and
Hutchings [6], is inversely proportional to the crater area; there-
fore, a sudden increase in the area results in a reduction of the
severity index, which will induce a change in the wear rate. The
changes in the wear volume described above are only partially
correlated with the test conditions, encouraging the investigation
of the interactions between the abrasive slurry and the surface of
the specimen in the contact zone. Scanning electron microscopy

analyses were conducted on different spherical cup depressions in
order to identify the wear mechanism produced by the dissimilar
test conditions.

Fig. 5 shows SEM micrographs of the dissimilar morphologies
of the spherical cup depressions induced by different test condi-
tions of the micro-scale abrasion tests. As these images show, two
different wear mechanisms were identified, rolling abrasion (see
Fig. 5(a)) and grooving abrasion (see Fig. 5(b)). Moreover, a
combination of both wear mechanisms (see Fig. 5(c)) was also
identified for several contact conditions. In order to facilitate
identification of the wear mechanisms present in each worn
surface, magnified images are shown in Fig. 5(a1)–(c1). Rolling
abrasion is characterized by multiple indentations in the worn
surface, (see Fig. 5(a1), whereas grooving abrasion (see Fig. 5(b1)
is characterized by parallel grooves in the worn surface which
results from the plastic deformation of the material. In turn, the
surface morphology, which displays a mixed-mode (rolling and
grooving abrasion), corresponds to a transition zone characterized
by a mixture of grooves and indentations, as shown in Fig. 5(c1).
The transition of rolling to grooving abrasion occurs due to the
embedding of particles in the surface. In this case grooving starts

to occur in the zone of higher contact pressure, while rolling is
more commonly located in the surrounding area of less pressure,
as shown in Fig. 5(c). Furthermore, in the tests performed with
25 vol% abrasive and a load of 0.5 N, especially for the shorter
tests, the wear scars displayed areas with ridge wear mechanism,
as Fig. 6 shows. Normally, this wear mechanism occurs for high
values of normal load when the abrasive particles are absent from
the contact region and contact is made directly between the
sphere and the specimen tested, leading to ridging marks in the
surface [8], see zone 1 marked in Fig. 6(a). In this investigation the
ridging points will be disregarded since, in this type of wear, the
abrasive particles do not influence the formation of the wear scars
and, therefore, the abrasion mechanism does not consider the
effect of the abrasive slurry.

4. Discussion

Considering the cumulative effect of the normal load multi-
plied by the sliding distance (N?x) product, the wear map for the
different test conditions was plotted on a wear volume against
N?x graph by identifying the regimes of interactions based on
SEM observations. As can be seen in Fig. 7, three well defined
zones (rolling abrasion zone, grooving abrasion zone and a mixed-
mode wear) can be perceived. The graph reveals that different
combinations of test conditions can produce the same wear
mechanism. Moreover, it is observed that for some combinations
of concentration of abrasive slurry and load, the same wear
mechanism is maintained even if the sliding distance is changed
(conditions of (50 vol%; 0.1 N), (65 vol%; 0.1 N) and (25 vol%;
0.2 N)). In these cases the wear volume always increases with
increasing sliding distance, even if the dominant wear mechanism
is grooving or rolling abrasion. However, some conditions of
abrasive slurry concentration and load are more prone to induce
one type of wear mechanism even when changing the sliding
distance. These changes are related to transitions in rolling to
mixed-mode mechanism and mixed-mode to rolling wear
mechanisms. For example, the wear scars produced with
25 vol% abrasive using a load of 0.1 N produces both rolling
abrasion and the mixed-mode wear mechanism depending on
the sliding distance. Table 2 summarizes the main wear mechan-
isms produced by the different test conditions. The rolling,
grooving and rolling–grooving abrasion regimes are differentiated
by using different symbols. The Table shows that low loads and
high volume fraction of abrasive slurry enable three-body abra-
sion, while grooving abrasion becomes stable at high loads and
low volume fraction of abrasive slurry. These last results are in
good agreement with previous studies [6,18].

Archard’s model is a suitable way to estimate a parameter able
to quantify the wear behavior of materials (the specific wear
rate). However experimental results only fit the model well if a
single wear mechanism occurs in all the tests. The results
displayed in Fig. 7 show that different combination of test
conditions can produce the same wear mechanism. So, in this
study the experimental results were organized into two groups
depending on the wear mechanism involved; rolling or grooving.

Subsequently, Archard’s model was applied to quantify the
specific wear volume characteristic of each wear mechanism.

The micro-scale abrasion test results of the rolling and groov-
ing abrasion points are shown in Fig. 8, as is the material volume
loss function of the product of the sliding distance by the normal
load. For each set of data, a straight linear trend was fitted to the
points, obtaining the specific wear rate as the slope of the
respective linear trend line, as shown by Eq. (2). A complete
reliability analysis of the specific wear rate is summarized in
Table 3 and, for each case, the confidence bands are plotted in
Fig. 8(b) for a confidence level of 90%. The results show that the
specific wear rate obtained from the rolling experimental data
points is around one order of magnitude higher than in the
corresponding grooving points. In fact, the rolling wear mode is
a more effective wear mechanism than the grooving mode,
leading to higher values of specific wear rate [5,18,24]. Further-
more, the reliability of results indicates that the correlation
coefficient for the specific wear rate calculated from the rolling
and grooving points is high, meaning that the quality of the linear
fittings displayed in Fig. 8 is suitable. Therefore, according to
these results, the specific wear rate can be estimated using points
produced with different test conditions, since a single wear mode
is sustained. Furthermore, these results lead to the conclusion
that the specific wear rate essentially depends on the wear
mechanisms (rolling or grooving) involved and not on the tests
conditions employed, since these do not produce changes in the
wear mechanism.
5. Conclusion
(i)
 In this investigation, silica slurry was used as an abrasive in
micro-scale abrasion equipment to study the influence of
different test conditions on the dominant wear modes of a
Ni-based coating deposited by PTA on gray cast iron.
(ii)
 The effect of different concentrations of abrasive slurry,
sliding distances and normal loads on the micro-abrasion of
a Ni-based coating were investigated and showed significant
differences between micro-abrasion rates and wear mechan-
isms as a function of these parameters.
(iii)
 The micro-abrasion mechanism maps were represented in
terms of volume loss as a function of the sliding distance
multiplied by the normal load. The results showed that
different combinations of tests can produce the same wear
mechanism. Low values of normal load and high contents of
abrasive particles enable rolling abrasion, while grooving
abrasion is stabilized at high loads and low volume fraction
of abrasive slurry.
(iv)
 The micro-scale abrasion results involving rolling and groov-
ing abrasion data, based on calculations of the specific wear
rate, revealed that this parameter can be successfully calcu-
lated using data points produced by dissimilar test condi-
tions since they give rise to a single wear mode. This result
led to the conclusion that the specific wear rate essentially
depends on the wear mechanisms involved and not on
the test conditions employed, since a single wear mode is
sustained (grooving or rolling abrasion).
(v)
 Abrasion by rolling wear induced a specific wear rate around
one order of magnitude higher than the value obtained under
grooving abrasion.

Appendix A. Error analysis of the equation of the wear
volume

This section aims to elucidate authors about the resultant error by
using an approximate equation to calculate the volume of a spherical
cup depression induced by the micro-scale abrasion tests.

The original equation used to calculate the volume of the
spherical cup depression is given by the Eq. (A1), where b and h
represent respectively the crater chordal diameter and the depth
of the spherical cup depression (see Fig A.1). However, in micro-
scale abrasion testing an approximate equation of Eq. (A1) is
currently used (see Eq. (A2)). In this equation R represents the ball
radius of the ball bearing used. The error of using an approximate

equation can be calculated by using Eq. (A3).

V ¼ð1=6Þ?f? h ?ð3 ?ðb=2Þ2þh2Þ ðA1Þ

V n ¼ðf? b4Þ=ð64 ? RÞ ðA2Þ

error¼ðV n?VÞ=V ðA3Þ

It is evident from Fig A.1 that increasing the depth h of the
spherical cup depression increases the value of the chordal
diameter b of the wear scar, until a maximum value of b equal
to 2R is reached. So, discretizing the value of b in small intervals it
is possible to calculate the associated values of V and Vn for each
relation between b and h. The value of h (given by Eq. (A4)), can be
easily deduced by subtracting the value of c from the value of R, as
represented in Fig A.1. The value of c is obtained by applying
Pythagoras’ Theorem at the triangle. Applying Eq. (A3) at the
dissimilar combinations of b and h it is possible obtain the error
associated by using an approximate equation to estimate the
volume of a spherical cup depression induced by the micro-scale
abrasion test. The results of the error are plotted in Fig A.2, dashed
line, as function of the ratio between the crater’s chordal diameter
and the radius of the ball with the relative error associated. As can
be seen in this figure, the resulting error is very small for low
ratios of b/R, however with an increase in this ratio, the error
increases. For example considering a spherical cup depression
with a chordal diameter equal to the radius of the ball, the error
committed in the calculations is about 10 percent.

h¼ R?ðR2?ðb=2Þ2Þ1=2 ðA4Þ

The level of correlation between the ratios of the depth of the
spherical cup depression and the ball radius with the error proved to
be linear. So, according to this relationship it is possible to establish a
correction factor for a desired value of error. For example, for a
desired error less than 1% a correction factor can be calculated as
indicated by Eq. (A5). By manipulating the equation it is possible to
determine the limits as a function of the ratio between b and R (see
Eq. (A6)). Fig A.2 displays the error obtained when the approximate
equation to estimate the volume of the wear scar is used, correction
factor applied (continuous lines) and without the correction factor
(dashed lines). As can be seen in the figure, the error of using the
expression with the corrective factor is one hundred times smaller
than that obtained with the expression without the corrective factor.
Although, the correction factor gives more accurate results for low
ratios between the chordal crater and the radius of the ball bearing,
the approximate equation to evaluate the volume of a spherical cup
depression is appropriate, due to the small error induced.

Abstract 

 

In the present investigation the effect of the substrate dilution on room and high 

temperature (550 and 700 ºC) tribological behavior of nickel based hardfaced coating 

deposited by plasma transferred arc onto a gray cast iron was investigated and compared to 

the uncoated gray cast iron. At room temperature, the wear loss of coatings was independent 

of the substrate dilution and similar to the gray cast iron. At high temperatures, coating 

produced with high dilution displayed the highest wear resistance between all the samples. 

This is attributed to the formation of a protective tribo-layer resulting from the agglomeration 

of a high amount of oxide debris due to its lower oxidation resistance when compared to the 

sample produced with low dilution.

1. Introduction 

 

Cast irons and copper-alloys are commonly used in the production of glass molds and 

accessories for glass industry, owing to their excellent thermal conductivity and relatively low 

cost [1]. Molds are often exposed to severe conditions of abrasion, oxidation, wear, fatigue at 

high temperature, due to repeated contact with melted glass, causing deformation or failure of

parts and, thus, compromising the product quality and increasing the maintenance costs. To 

overcome this shortcoming protective coatings are normally applied at molds surfaces with 

the aim of increasing their lifetime in harsh environments [2, 3]. A wide diversity of coating 

materials have been successfully applied to protect the surface of these components, such as: 

cobalt, iron and nickel alloys [2, 4, 5]. The latter have been especially used due to their 

outstanding performance under extreme high temperature conditions [5-8]. Several hardfacing 

and thermal spraying processes have been used to coat the molds: (i) plasma transferred arc 

(PTA) and gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), (ii) flame spraying (FS), high velocity oxy fuel 

(HVOF) and atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). Hardfacing processes have been 

preferentially used in the protection of mold surfaces because they promote a strong 

metallurgical bonding between the coating and the substrate, condition required to achieve 

high quality adherent coatings and to avoid the catastrophic failure in service, as opposed to 

thermal spraying processes where only a mechanical bonding is established. Among the 

hardfacing processes referred to above, PTA has been widely used to protect the surface of 

molds, since it produces high quality thick coatings, offering both optimal protection with 

minimal thermal distortion of parts and high deposition rates in single layer deposits [4, 5]. 

However, the properties and the quality of deposits are strongly dependent on the dilution of 

the substrate promoted by the PTA process. Low dilution provides coatings with similar 

chemical composition to the added metal powder, condition for achieving enhanced 

mechanical properties, wear and oxidation resistance [9]. To avoid adhesion problems and, 

therefore, not to compromise the performance of molds in service, it is common to increase 

the dilution through the change of the most relevant deposition parameters even if the 

mechanical properties, wear and oxidation resistance are diminished. In our previous studies 

[10, 12] the effect of increasing dilution, promoted by change of arc current on the structure, 

mechanical properties, oxidation resistance and wear behavior of a nickel-based alloy 

deposited onto a gray cast iron have been investigated. Regarding the wear behavior of 

coatings, ball cratering wear tester has been selected to reproduce the wear mechanism 

produced by the interaction between the melted glass and the surface of molds (three body 

abrasion). However, this equipment does not allow consider the high temperature effect. 

Hence, as a way to complement the previous studies, the aim of this investigation is to study 

the effect of increasing substrate dilution on the tribological performance at room and 

essentially at high temperature of as deposited Ni-based coating deposited onto gray cast iron, 

using a pin on disc tribometer apparatus. Comparison of these results with those achieved for 

the base material is also provided.

2. Experimental procedure 

 

A nickel-based hardfacing alloy powder named Colmonoy 215 (from Colmonoy 

company) was deposited by plasma transferred arc using a Commersald Group ROBO 90 

machine onto flat surfaces of gray cast iron blocks, currently used in the production of molds 

for the glass industry. Two different arc currents (100 and 140 amperes) were used on the 

depositions to produce coatings with two dissimilar levels of dilution. Hereinafter, the 

coatings deposited using 100 and 140 amperes will be designated as C100 and C140, 

respectively. Table 1 gives the optimized parameters used in the depositions, while Table 2 

depicts the nominal chemical composition of the base material and Colmonoy 215 powder. 

Before coating, the substrate blocks were preheated at 480 ºC to reduce the cooling rate and 

therefore to avoid the susceptibility to cracking during deposition. Using the same deposition 

conditions, several weld beads, each with approximately 3 to 5 mm thick, were deposited in 

parallel on the cast iron, ensuring some overlapping between them in order to obtain a 35×35 

mm coated surface area and a quasi-flat surface. Specimens containing cast iron and coating 

were removed from each block for microstructural and micro-hardness analysis. Further, 

specimens with dimension of 20×20×5 mm were removed from each block for tribological 

testing. The coated surfaces were first machined to provide flatness and then grinded and 

polished following standard procedures to obtain a uniform roughness of about 0.51 – 0.62 

µm. 

The tribological behavior of the coatings and gray cast iron was evaluated at room and 

high temperatures using a pin-on-disk tribometer. As the operating surface temperature of 

molds is currently in the range of 500 - 900 ºC, temperatures of 550 and 700 ºC were selected 

to perform the experiments. Although in the real working conditions of molds glass acts as an 

abrasive material, due to its melted state at high temperature,  for the tribological tests we 

have selected as counterpart a harder and more resistant material: Al2O3 balls. Thus we ensure 

that the wear volume loss of coatings will be overestimated in relation to the expected loss in 

actual service conditions. All the wear tests were conducted at a constant linear speed of 0.10 

m.s
-1

, a load of 5 N, a relative humidity of 48±5%, and 5000 cycles. The radius of the wear 

tracks was set to 5.3 mm. During the tests, the friction coefficient was continuously recorded. 

Two tests were performed under identical conditions for each coating. After tribological tests, 

the wear rate of the coatings was determined from the cross section wear track area using a 

3D optical profilometer and the wear tracks and wear debris were characterized by scanning

3. Results and discussion 

 

3.1. Microstructure, composition and hardness of the as deposited coatings 

 

The typical microstructure of gray cast iron and coatings produced with 100 and 140 A 

is depicted in Fig. 1. Both coatings display relatively dense microstructure with excellent 

adhesion to the substrate, free of microcracks and only a few solidification voids. Their 

typical microstructure consists of dendrites of Ni-Fe solid solution phase aligned along the 

direction of heat flow. Flakes of carbon (dark-floret like phase) randomly distributed in the 

matrix can be perceived too, being more notorious on C140 coating. The high amount of dark-

floret phase on C140 coating is in good agreement with the observed increase of dilution with 

increasing arc current. Following the procedure described in reference [11], dilutions of ~28 

and ~59% were measured for C100 and C140 coatings, respectively. The dilution is beneficial 

in terms of improving the adhesion, but it can bring some disadvantages, such as change in 

the hardness and chemical composition, and lowering of wear and oxidation resistance of the 

coatings [9]. The chemical composition of coatings, assessed by SEM-EDS given in Table 3, 

were evaluated from the average of several measurements performed on an area 400×400 µm 

in the cross section at middle thickness of each coating. This procedure was used to ensure 

that the chemical composition was determined in a representative volume of material in that 

zone, thus avoiding problems that punctual analyses can give in heterogeneous materials. The

results show that the main differences were in the iron, silicon and carbon contents, in good 

agreement with the different dilutions in the samples. The gray cast iron shows flakes of 

graphite evenly distributed in a ferritic matrix.

Fig. 2 shows the Vickers hardness profiles across the interface of the deposited 

coatings, measured with 5 N applied load. As it would be expected, the increase in the weld 

current, and therefore increase in dilution, gives rise to a decrease of the hardness either in the 

coating, undesirable in terms of wear, or in the heat affected zone (HAZ), which is favourable 

in terms of toughness of this region. The average surface hardness of coatings C100, C140 

and gray cast iron was 300, 195 and 150 Vickers (HV0.5), respectively. The high hardness of 

the HAZ zone in relation to the non-thermal affected based material is related to the formation 

of hard and brittle phases. The detailed characterization of the microstructure of each coating

and the hardness variations with increasing dilution can be found in a previous publication of 

the authors [11].

4. Tribological behavior of coatings 

 

4.1. Wear rate 

 

Figure 3 shows the wear loss rate of coatings and gray cast iron tested at different 

temperatures. It clearly shows that at room temperature the wear loss of coatings and gray cast 

iron is very low, and almost independent of the substrate dilution. C100 coating displays a 

little higher wear resistance than C140 coating, in agreement with its higher hardness. The 

observed similar level of wear rate of the gray cast iron as compared to the Ni coatings at RT 

is due to its higher amount of graphite that can act as solid lubricant, leading to a less volume 

loss of material. It should be pointed out that the low hardness displayed by the gray cast iron 

compared to the coated samples is compensated by the presence of graphite on the sliding 

contact [13, 14]. 

At temperature of 550 ºC an abrupt increase of the wear rate of coatings was observed; 

however, it dropped with further increase to 700 ºC. The first increase of the wear rate can be 

attributed to the spontaneous oxidation, while, as it will be seen later, following decrease of 

wear loss at 700 ºC could be related to the formation of high amount of oxides on the wear 

track preventing further wear of the coatings. Besides, coating produced with high dilution 

displayed much higher wear resistance at elevated temperatures than C100 coating. This

behavior is a result of the low oxidation resistance of C140 coating that will contribute to the 

formation of a high amount of oxides in the contact zone. A continuous increase of the wear 

rate with increasing temperature was observed for the gray cast iron. This material showed 

much higher wear rate than the Ni-based coatings, indicating that the latter should perform 

better at high temperature. This is an expected result since rapid loss of the material 

mechanical strength and increasing oxidation rate with temperature are typical of gray cast 

iron. 

 

Figure 3 - Variation of the wear rate of coatings and gray cast iron with test temperature. 

4.2. Friction coefficient 

 

The evolution of the friction coefficient of coatings and gray cast iron with increasing 

test temperature is shown in Figure 4. As expected, all the friction curves displayed two 

distinct regions: running-in stage and steady state stage. At RT, the running-in stage for both 

Ni-based coatings is similar and characterized by strong increase of the friction coefficient to 

the highest value of 0.74, followed by rapid decrease down to 0.41, after the first 1000 laps. 

On the other hand, in gray cast iron, friction coefficient slightly increased over time reaching 

the steady state after 4000 laps with a friction coefficient of about 0.39. Gray cast iron 

exhibited relatively low friction coefficient at RT as compared to the Ni-based alloys. 

According to the literature [13, 14], this behavior is related to the presence of graphite on the 

worn surface that acts as a solid lubricant compensating the lower hardness displayed by the 

material and thus leading to wear rate values similar to Ni-based coatings.

A long running-in period was also noticed with a progressive increase of the friction 

coefficient for the gray cast iron when the temperature was 550 ºC; however, friction was 

much higher suggesting different contact conditions. Ni-based coatings displayed very short 

running-in periods with friction stabilized at similar values as in RT tests. Finally, the tests at 

700 ºC exhibited different trends between cast iron and coatings. In the first case, a small 

decrease in the final friction coefficient value was achieved whereas an inverse situation was 

observed for coated samples, with friction stabilized at values of approximately 0.6 and 0.65 

for C100 and C140 coatings, respectively. Such trends suggest that different contact 

conditions should have been taking place in both situations. 

In many cases, especially at high temperatures, the friction curves displayed quite 

unstable values. According to Kesavan and Kamaj [15], such behavior demonstrates the 

presence of tribolayer on the sliding surfaces; the tribolayer is continually worn out and 

formed again, which results in short-term friction coefficient oscillations.

4.3. Wear mechanisms and surface analysis of coatings 

 

The changes of the wear rates and friction coefficients described above can be 

attributed to a great number of factors, such as the chemical composition, physical properties 

of materials, or applied test conditions. Therefore, the investigation of the interaction between 

the specimen-counterpart pair was carried out. Scanning electron microscopy with energy 

dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and Raman spectroscopy were used to 

characterize the dominant wear mechanisms and the wear debris originated by the tribological 

testing.

4.3.1. Worn surfaces at room temperature 

 

Typical SEM micrographs in secondary electrons of the worn surface of coatings and 

gray cast iron tested against Al2O3 balls at RT are depicted in Figure 5. The wear tracks of Ni-

based coatings are similar; they present a rough morphology with evidence of tribo-oxidation. 

The oxide adhered layer is cracked, which reveals its brittle nature. Raman spectra performed 

at the oxidized worn surface of the coatings (see spectra a) and b) in Fig. 6 for C100 and C140 

coatings, respectively) confirmed the presence of the oxides, namely Raman active modes 

assigned to Ni-O [16] and C [17]; the latter almost inexistent in C100 sample spectrum as a 

consequence of its much lower dilution. These results are in good agreement to EDS analysis 

(see Fig. 5 d) for C100 coating as an example), which showed essentially strong signals of Ni 

and O; vestiges of Fe, Si, Al and C were also detected. Similar wear debris was found on the 

wear scars of the balls too. During the wear tests the friction, generated by the sliding of the 

ball against the coating surface, causes the increase of the local temperature, mainly in the 

protuberances contact, promoting the tribo-oxidation of the surface. During this phase, the 

metal-ceramic contact will progressively decrease with more and more surface being covered 

by an oxide phase. With the test running, the oxide tribo-layer will grow and the contact shall 

be governed between this growing tribo-layer and the counterpart, until a steady state will 

occur. Metal-ceramic contact gave rise to a higher friction coefficient that should decreases 

until a constant and lower value corresponding to the same oxide, NiO as shown by Raman 

spectroscopy, formed on the top surface. It explains the similar level of wear resistance and 

friction values of the coatings even despite of their discrepancy in hardness and chemical 

composition due to different dilution levels. The high hardness of the metallic coatings, in 

conjunction with the protective effect of the hard NiO oxide, led to very low wear volumes. 

Distinct wear behavior was found for the gray cast iron. Its wear track displays a very 

clean surface with fine scratches parallel to the relative sliding movement (suggesting 

abrasion wear mechanism) and some adherent wear debris. Further, in some places, black 

regions can be noticed, which can be attributed to either the presence of graphite or its pull-

out from the material [18]. EDS analysis performed at the wear debris revealed that they 

represent a mixture of original and oxidized material, including a weak signal from graphite 

lamellas. Similar phases were detected on clean worn surface, although C peak was much 

more intense there. Raman spectroscopy analysis showed the presence of hematite (?-Fe2O3) 

[19] and nanocrystalline graphite through the characteristic D and G bands [20] (see spectrum 

c) and d) of Fig. 6 for wear debris and clean surface, respectively). During sliding 



Annex E 

135 
Filipe Daniel Fernandes 

experiments the movement of the ball promotes the wear of surface specimen with production 

of both oxide and graphite debris. Graphite will act as a solid lubricant in tribo-film, 

promoting a decrease of friction coefficient and having, indirectly, an important impact on the 

wear [13, 14]. As a consequence, similar level of wear resistance was observed between base

4.3.2. High Temperature 

 

When sliding occurred at 550 ºC, C100 and C140 coatings also showed oxides on the 

contact surface. However, C140 wear track was almost fully covered whereas C100 exhibited 

an irregular surface with a mixture of clean wear zones and oxidized ones with signs of 

adhesive and abrasive wear (see Fig. 7 a-b), suggesting an incomplete formation of an oxide 

transfer layer. The difference between the two samples can be interpreted considering their 

oxidation behavior. In fact, C100 sample oxidizes through the formation of a protective 

mixture of oxides based on B / Si over a Ni-based oxide layer [10]. Although these oxides are 

protective in static oxidation conditions, B-oxide melts below 600 ºC [21, 22], which leads to 

its easy removal hindering the formation of a stable oxide layer over the surface. As the 

process requires some time, since temperatures are still low being oxidation rates reduced 

[10], the destruction of the growing oxide layers is relatively easy and the formation of a 

transfer layer is limited due to the dragging effect caused by the ball sliding and melted B-

oxide. Therefore, high wear volumes are expected and indeed the steep increase in the wear 

rate can be noticed in Fig. 3. In the case of C140 sample, besides Ni-based oxides, iron oxide 

is also formed during oxidation at these temperatures [10]. The oxidation rates are much 

higher compared to C100 sample due to higher dilution. Therefore, a higher amount of oxide 

debris can be produced facilitating the formation of a continuous oxide transfer layer. The 

surface is thus protected quickly and, in spite of the much higher wear rate in comparison to

RT test, the wear resistance is higher than that for C100 sample. Raman analysis performed at 

the adhesive wear debris on C100 coating indicated that they were mainly Ni-O, although, 

according to the EDS analysis, Fe-O, Si-O and Al-O should also coexist in much less amount. 

It is in good agreement to our previous work on the oxidation behavior of this coating [10]. At 

the clean zone (bottom part) of the worn surface EDS showed non-oxidized coating material. 

For C140 coating, Raman analysis showed similar oxides but, in this case, a significant 

amount of iron oxides (hematite and magnetite (Fe3O4)) were also detected, in good 

agreement to higher level of dilution and to the oxidation studies where this oxide was found 

to be the main constituent of the oxide scale [10]. Additionally, strong signals of C-based 

phases were detected by EDS. 

Gray cast iron was fully covered with an oxide layer at this temperature, with 

scratches parallel to the movement of the sliding. The main oxides identified in the wear track 

were hematite and magnetite (see Raman spectrum c) of Figure 8). The softening of the 

material, induced by the temperature increase, together with the total depletion of graphite 

from the track surface justify the sharp increase in the wear rate, as well as the increase in the  

friction coefficient in comparison to results at RT.

Figure 8 - Raman spectra performed on the worn surface of: a) C100 coating tested at 550 ºC, b) C140 coating 

tested at 550 ºC, c) gray cast iron tested at 550 ºC. 

At 700 ºC the oxidation rate of Ni-based coatings increased significantly allowing 

rapid and easy formation of a continuous oxide layer on the worn surfaces (see Fig. 9). The 

oxide acts as a protective layer decreasing the wear loss of coatings. As the major wear 

volume loss is produced during the formation of the protective oxide layer, faster production 

of tribolayer decreased the wear rate in relation to 550 ºC testing (see Fig. 3). Similar results 

were achieved and in detail explained by Kesavan et al. [15]. Furthermore, since the oxidation 

rate of C140 coating is higher than that of C100 coating, the latter will take more time to form 

the oxide layer generating a higher coating wear volume in the initial stage of the wear 

process. As a consequence, total wear rate after the test will be higher as well. Raman analysis 

of the wear tracks of both coatings showed the presence of Ni-O (see spectra a) and b) of Fig. 

10); moreover, iron oxides were identified in C140 coating. 

On the other hand, gray cast iron oxidizes easily but the oxide does not support the 

sliding process and does not protect efficiently the base material. The increase in the 

temperature promotes a severe softening of the material and a high oxidation rate leading to a 

strong abrasion and, therefore, a very high wear loss. Raman analysis confirms the extensive 

formation of hematite in the wear track (spectra c of Fig. 10); signs of magnetite were also 

detected. 

In summary, although dilution reduces the hardness of coatings, it has beneficial effect 

at high temperature tribological behavior due to the faster formation of an oxide layers (owing 

to its less oxidation resistance) which protect the coating surface against wear.

Conclusions 

 

Nickel based hardfaced coating deposited by plasma transferred arc on gray cast iron 

with two dissimilar levels of dilution, were tribologically tested at room and high 

temperatures and compared to uncoated gray iron. The results showed that the wear loss of 

the coatings was independent of the substrate dilution at room temperature; tribo-oxidation 

was the main wear mechanism. Despite its lower hardness, gray cast iron showed similar wear 

rate as Ni-based coatings due to the lubricious effect of a C tribo-layer formed on the sliding 

surfaces. Increase sliding test temperature to 550 ºC led to an abrupt increase of the wear rate 

of the coatings and the gray cast iron due to the material softening and oxidation. Gray cast 

iron showed extremely high wear values due to the continuous removal of the oxides, which 

exposed the soft non-oxidized material. Ni-O based layer protected more efficiently the Ni-

based coatings. Further increase in test temperature to 700 ºC led to the improvement of the 

wear resistance of coatings and an intensification of the wear on gray cast iron. The coating 

produced with the highest dilution displayed the highest wear resistance at elevated 

temperatures. This behavior was related to its lower oxidation resistance, which promoted the 

easier formation of high amounts of oxide wear debris and their agglomeration into compact 

oxide tribolayer acting as protection of wearing surfaces.

In the present investigation, the influence of the addition of nanostructure zirconia particles on the
microstructure, micro-hardness and wear performance of a Ni-based alloy (Colmonoy 88) deposited by
atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) on low carbon steel has been reported. Two different procedures
were tested: (i) spraying powders of Colmonoy 88 and zirconia mixed by mechanical alloying and (ii)
spraying powders separately using a dual powder injection system available at the APS equipment. The
microstructure and the mechanical properties of coatings were characterized by scanning electron
microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and micro-hardness
measurements. The tribological properties were evaluated at room temperature in reciprocating sliding
wear equipment. The results indicate that the as-sprayed modified coatings were mainly composed by
Ni, Ni–Cr–Fe, Cr23C6, Cr5B3, and tetragonal zirconia. Evenly distribution of zirconia can be seen in the
coatings produced by powders prepared by mechanical alloying, while dispersive ones can be seen in the
other case. Hardness and wear resistance of coatings is increased with nanostructured zirconia additions,
while their friction coefficient is decreased. Coatings produced with mechanical alloying show the
highest wear resistance of all tested coatings. Nanostructured ZrO2 coating displays the worst wear
resistance.

1. Introduction

Improvement of the surface properties by thermal spraying
hard and wear resistant materials is a commonly used industrial
practice [1–3]. The base material provides the overall mechanical
strength of the components while coatings provide a way of
extending the limits of their use at the upper end of their
performance capabilities.

A wide variety of coating materials such as cobalt, iron and
nickel alloys can be successfully applied by thermal spraying
technologies to protect the surface of components subjected to
harsh environments [4–6]. Superalloys and cermet APS (atmo-
spheric plasma spraying) coatings have been widely employed to
improve the oxidation, corrosion, abrasion and wear resistance of
engineering components, such as plungers, molds, wearing plats,
turbines, tools, etc, whose surface is submitted to extreme tribo-
logical conditions in service [7–10]. Nickel-based alloys have been
especially used in the protection of parts due to their unique
combination of properties (mechanical, tribological, and high
temperature properties) [11–14]. The microstructure and the wear

nandes).
behavior of cobalt, iron and nickel alloys coatings have been
studied using several alloy compositions, several processes of
deposition and different substrates. Regarding the wear resistance
of these coatings, some special composite systems were studied
and developed. The incorporation of hard and stable carbides and
oxide phases, such as CrC, SiC, WC, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, CeO2, etc, in
these coatings, has been reported as a way to improve their wear
resistance. For example, Hou et al. [15] showed the beneficial
effect of nano-Al2O3 particles on the microstructure and wear
resistance of a nickel-based alloy coating deposited by plasma
transferred arc (PTA). Harsha et al. [1] studied the influence of CrC
on the microstructure, microhardness and wear resistance of a
nickel-based alloy deposited by flame spraying process. They
observed that the wear resistance of the Ni modified coating is
increased relatively to the CrC-free Ni-based alloy. Wang et al. [16]
investigated the effect of three nano-particles additions (Al2O3,
SiC, CeO2) on the high temperature wear behavior of a Ni-based
alloy coatings produced by laser cladding technique and reported
that the addition of these nanoparticles increased the wear
resistance of the coatings. Regarding the effect of incorporation
of ZrO2 particles in a Ni matrix, it has also been extensively studied
[17–20]; however, only electrodeposited coatings have been con-
cerned. Despite of these studies to improve the wear resistance of
Ni electrodeposited coatings, at our knowlodgment no reports

2. Experimental procedure

2.1. Materials

In this investigation commercial powders of a Ni-based alloy
(Colmonoy 88) and nanostructured zirconia from the “Wall Colmonoy”
and “Innovnano” companies, respectively, were used as feedstock to
produce coatings with Atmospheric Plasma Spraying process (APS)
onto a low carbon steel substrate (AISI 8620). The Ni-based alloy
powders have been characterized as a spherical morphology with an
average size D50 of 45 mm and density of 7900 (kg/m3), whilst
nanostructured ZrO2 powders have an average primary particle size
of 60 nm with granule size D50 of 60 mm and density 1700 (kg/m3).
The chemical compositions of the as-received powders are displayed
in Table 1. The plasma sprayed coatings were deposited with an APS
A3000 system from “Sulzer Metco”, using either pure as-received
powders and a dual system for powder injection available at the
APS equipment (designated as “Dual”) or mixtures of powders
prepared by mechanical alloying (MA) process (designated as “MA”).
The substrate material was grit-blasted with alumina grade 24 from
“Alodur Germany” before coating (which induced a corresponding
superficial roughness (Ra) of 5 mm), to increase the surface roughness
and achieve the proper mechanical interlocking between the coating
and the substrate. For pure colmonoy and zirconia coatings and Dual
procedure, the substrates were fixed positioned, being the spraying of
the surface ensured by the movement of the torch. On the other hand,

Fig. 3. Energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis (EDS) of a powde
in the MA method the substrates were placed in a rotatory table and
the spraying was performed by combining this rotation with the
vertical movement of the torch. Before final depositions, preliminary
coatings were produced changing the main deposition parameters
and, then, characterized in order to properly select the depositions
conditions that allowed achieving the best results. Moreover, during
depositions the substrates were cooled down by two pressurized air
guns keeping the temperature below 150 1C, in order to avoid cracking
and residual stresses formation.

Powders mixtures were prepared by mechanical alloying in a
Fritsch planetary ball mill using a 250 ml hardened steel vial and
fifteen balls with 20 mm diameter of the same material. Two propor-
tions of nanostructured zirconia were added to the nickel-based alloy
powder, 20% and 40% in volume, i.e. 5.1 and 12.5 gr of nanostructured
ZrO2 powder for 94.9 and 87.4 gr of nickel-based alloy powder,
respectively. The MA process was carried out at 400 rpm for 2 h in a
protective atmosphere of argon. After 1 h of milling, the process was
interrupted for 10 min to cool the vial and to reserve rotation. Finally,
after milling, the powder was mechanical sieved to obtain particles
with a size distribution in the range [28–71 mm]. Two different
coatings also containing nanostructured zirconia additions of 20%
and 40% were also performed by using the dual system of powder
injection available at the APS equipment. In this case the proportion
was easily achieved by controlling the flow of powders through the
rotation control of the powder feeders. Henceforth, coatings produced
using as received pure powder of nickel-based alloy and nanostruc-
tured zirconia will be designated as “Ni”, and “ZrO2”, respectively,
coatings produced with powders prepared by mechanical alloying
using 20% and 40% of nanostructured ZrO2 will be termed as “Ni+20%
MA” and “Ni+40% MA”, respectively, and coatings deposited using the
dual system of powder injection with 20% and 40% of nanostructured
ZrO2 will be designated as “Ni+20% Dual” and “Ni+40% Dual”,
respectively. The process parameters employed in the dissimilar
coating depositions are shown in Table 2.
2.2. Powders and coatings characterization

Powders morphology were observed and characterized by scan-
ning electron microscopy with X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) and
X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Co K? radiation. Transverse section
of APS coatings was polished using conventional metallographic
procedure which consisted grinding followed by polishing. The
microstructure of coatings was studied and characterized by optical
microscope (OM) and SEM/EDS. Further, the structure of the coatings
was studied by X-ray diffraction. The micro-hardness of coatings was
determined by Vickers testing using a 3 N load at 15 s holding time. A
total of 30 measurements of hardness were done in each coating.

2.3. Wear tests

Wear behavior of APS coatings was studied using reciprocating
wear equipment. An harmonic wave generated by an eccentric and
rod mechanism imposed a stroke length of 2.05 mm at a frequency
of 1 Hz. A detailed description of the equipment can be found in
reference [21]. Before wear tests, the surface of coatings were
grounded and then polished using a 3 mm diamond past. A superficial
roughness Ra of: 0.51, 0.65, 0.49 and 0.98 mm was measured
respectively for Ni, Ni Dual, Ni MA and ZrO2 coatings. In the scope
of the present study, the values of normal load applied to the coated
samples were 5, 7, 8.5 and 10 N. All the tests were conducted at a
constant rotational speed of 190 rpm during 2 h. The acquisition time

of signal used was 60 s. A soda-lime glass sphere with 500 HV0.5 of
hardness and 10 mm in diameter was used as counterpart, in order
to study the interaction of glass with the different coatings. After
wear tests, the volume loss was estimated through the transverse
profile of each wear scar at the middle and near the end of both sides
of the scar. To ensure the reproducibility of results, a set of three scars
for each test condition was performed at the coating, and the volume
loss calculated by using the volume average of these marks. An
approach of the Archard's law was applied; see Eq. (1), in order to
obtain the specific wear rate. In this equation, V represents the wear
volume, P is the normal load, k is the specific wear rate and l the
sliding distance. To estimate the error of the measurements, a
statistical analysis described elsewhere by A. Ramalho [22] was used.

Ni and ZrO2 powders clearly display spherical-shaped particles, while
MA powders have irregular shapes. XRD patterns in Fig. 2 shows that
Ni powders consist essentially in a Ni solid solution (ICDD card 01-
1258) with some traces of chromium carbide (ICDD card 85-1281)
and tungsten (ICDD card 47-1319). This indexation is in agreement
with the results from the literature where similar phases were
detected [23]. Nanostructured ZrO2 powders are essentially formed
by tetragonal zirconia. In respect to MA powders XRD pattern reveal
the same phases indexed from the pure Ni and nanostructured ZrO2
powders, suggesting only physical mixing, not having occurred
chemical reactions. Fig. 3 shows a SEM-EDS analysis performed at a

is essentially formed by nickel, zirconia, oxygen and tungsten,
supporting the results from the XRD analysis.

3.2. Microstructure

Fig. 4 shows SEM micrographs of the cross section of the
coatings. All coatings present the typical morphology of plasma
spraying, with pores, lamellae, partially melted and un-melted
particles and good adhesion to the substrate. ZrO2 (see Fig. 4b) and
Ni+ZrO2 Dual coatings (Fig. 4(c and d)) show a higher level of
porosity than the other coatings. Very often, small pores were
found within the flattened particles and result from shrinkage
porosity and big pores were normally located between lamellae
and were caused by gas porosity phenomenon [24]. In all cases the
melting states of particles influence the level of porosity and,
usually, low melting state of particles gives rise to a porous
microstructure. Furthermore, pure ZrO2 coating, (see Fig. 4b)
reveals the presence of some cracks in the coating, resulting from
tensile residual stresses generated during cooling down to room
temperature. Ni and MA coatings (see Fig. 4(a), (e) and (f)) display
a compact and homogenous structure, while Dual coatings
revealed a microstructure full of semi-melted particles, suggesting
a brittle character based on low level of agglomeration between
particles. It is well known that in the thermal spraying processes
the melting level depends on the thermal energy added to the
particles, on the plasma temperature and on the particles flying
time. During plasma spraying, molten particles impact the surface



F. Fernandes et al. / Wear 303 (2013) 591–601 597
of substrate, then deform, solidify and transform into lamellae.
During spraying, the particles can be in all of the following
states on impact: fully molten, superheated, semi-molten and
molten then re-solidified [24,25], depending on the deposition
parameters. It is well known that in plasma spraying the electric
arc current, the primary plasma gas flow rate, the second plasma
gas flow rate and powder size are the main parameters that
influence the in-flight particle behaviors. From Table 2, comparing
the process parameters for the Ni and Ni+20% and 40% ZrO2 Dual
coatings, differences can be observed in relation to the spray
distance, primary and secondary gas flow rates, and powder feed
rate. According to the literature, an increase of argon flow rate
leads to a gentle decrease of particle temperature but a rapid
increase of velocity [26]. On the other hand, increasing the
hydrogen flow rate increases both, temperature and velocity,
though temperature is more sensitive to the hydrogen flow rate
than velocity. So, due to the lower primary gas flow rate (Ar) and
higher secondary gas flow rate (H2) used in the Ni +ZrO2 Dual
coatings, would be expected a great level of melting particles and
consequently an homogenous structure, if the particles do not
oxidize during the in-flight time. However, such fact was not
observed. The lower primary gas flow rate (Ar) used in the
production of these coatings might suggest that independently
of the high melting state of particles, the velocity given by the flow
could be not enough to accelerate the particles onto the specimen
surface. Nevertheless, the same process parameters were used in
the deposition of the Ni+20% MA coating, with exception of the
spraying distance, and the microstructure revealed to be homo-
genous and compact. In fact, the spraying distance also plays an
important role in the thermal treatment of particles during their
in-flight time [27]. Thereby, for short spraying distances, due to
the short exposure of particles in the flame, the energy added by
the flame could be not enough to semi-molten or molten the
particles, giving rise to a microstructure similar to those observed
for these coatings. Furthermore, it can also be speculated that the
two different ways to add zirconia at the nickel alloy can change
the entropy of the system, and therefore change the running-on of
Fig. 10. Variation of the friction force of coatings with applied load for: (a) Ni coating,
the deposition. In fact, according to the literature the nature of
powders has a detrimental effect in their interaction with the
plasma spraying flame and, therefore, on the properties of the
coatings [28]. The low level of melting particles can also explain
the high level of porosity observed in these coatings.

For better characterization and perception of the different
coatings microstructure, magnifications of the Ni, Ni+40% Dual
and Ni+40% MA coatings, as well as EDS analyses are shown in
Fig. 5. The EDS analysis revealed that Ni coating is essentially
formed by Ni, W, Cr and Fe, which matches well with the chemical
composition of the as received Ni powders. Moreover, small
particles rich in W (white phase) can be observed evenly dis-
tributed in the microstructure. The semi-melted particles in the
microstructure of the Ni+40% Dual coating are from the same
nature of the Ni coating matrix, therefore, they can be identified as
semi-melted Colmonoy powders. Similar to Ni coating a white
phase rich in W is also detected in the microstructure, co-existing
with a coarse gray phase, entrapped between the boundaries of
the semi-melted particles, revealed by EDS to be zirconia. Such a
distribution is in the basis of a brittle behavior. Contrary to this
coating, Ni+40% MA displays a compact and homogeneous micro-
structure, with small zirconia particles evenly distributed along
the microstructure improving the coating toughness. Therefore,
from these results, it can be inferred that the addition of nano-
structured zirconia can be successfully achieved by using both
procedures, powders prepared by mechanical alloying or dual
projection. However, in coatings deposited with MA powders
zirconia is finer and more homogeneously distributed in the
Ni-matrix giving rise to better mechanical performance.

XRD patterns of the coatings are displayed in Fig. 6. As the
spectrum reveals, the nickel-based coating consists mainly of Ni,
Ni-Cr-Fe, Cr23C6 and Cr5B3 phases. These results are in accordance
with the literature where similar phases were identified [23].
Moreover, all the coatings with nanostructured zirconia additions
showed diffraction lines corresponding to the same phases identi-
fied at both the Ni and ZrO2 coatings. In the latter, is mainly
formed by tetragonal zirconia.

3.3. Micro-hardness

Fig. 7 shows that nanostructured ZrO2 additions increases the
hardness of the nickel-based alloy. The same behavior was reported
by other authors after addition of hard particles such as (Al2O3, CeO2,
SiC, WC) at a nickel alloy [1,3,16]. However, MA coatings have higher
hardness than Dual ones. This result is coherent with either the
lower porosity or the finer and more homogeneous distribution of
nanostructured zirconia in Ni+ZrO2 MA coatings.

3.4. Wear behavior

The volume loss due to wear of the coatings and counterpart
increases with increasing applied load, as it is shown in Fig. 8(a) and
(b), respectively, being this trend more notorious for ZrO2 coating. As it
will be shown later, the higher volume loss for this coating can be
correlated with the brittle behavior as displayed on its worn surface.
Nanostructured zirconia additions have a positive effect, decreasing
the volume loss of material, independently of the deposition proce-
dure used. However, efficiency seems to be higher in Ni+ZrO2 MA
coatings which display higher decreases of the volume loss than Ni
+ZrO2 Dual coatings. Furthermore, increasing zirconia content in MA
coatings continues to have a beneficial effect whereas the inverse is
observed in Dual coatings. The better wear performance of Ni+ZrO2
MA coatings can be attributed to the combination of a higher
hardness, an evenly distribution of smaller zirconia domains in the
Ni-based matrix and a more compact microstructure. In fact, the
presence of hard phases increases the overall hardness of the coating
and, on the other hand, smaller and uniformly distributed hard
Fig. 11. SEM morphologies of the worn surfaces tested at 8.5 N load of the:
domains in a soft matrix gives rise to tougher materials, which
combined lead to a decrease of the volume loss due to wear. Similar
behavior was observed by other author after adding hard particles to a
nickel based alloy [1,15]. In the case of Ni+ZrO2 Dual coatings
nanostructured hard ZrO2 phases have initially a similar influence,
by increasing the hardness. However, the agglomeration of ZrO2
particles, localized in-between Ni-based lamellae makes microstruc-
ture less tough with its consequent detrimental effect on the wear
performance when high contents of the hard phase exist.

In order to normalize the wear results, they were plotted in Fig. 9
in terms of material volume loss as function of the product of sliding
distance by the applied load. For each set of data, a straight linear
trend was fitted in order to obtain the specific wear rate from the
slope (see Eq. 1). Further, a complete reliability analysis of the specific
wear rate is presented in Table 3 for a confidence interval of 90%.
Because of the high volume loss displayed by the ZrO2 coating, only
the point produced with lower load and the beginning of the straight
adjustment were plotted in Fig. 9. Crossing the information of Fig. 9
and Table 3 it is possible conclude the specific wear rate of
Ni-modified coatings is lower than that of the un-modified Ni coating.
Ni+40% ZrO2 dual coating display the lowest specific wear rate, being
this result attributed to the higher hardness displayed by this coating.
Further, coatings produced by the dual system of powder injection
display higher specific wear rate than coatings produced by powders
prepared by mechanical alloying. ZrO2 coating displays the highest
specific wear rate, being one and two orders of magnitude greater
than the un-modified and modified coatings, respectively.

The average values of the frictional force of the Ni, Ni+40% Dual,
Ni+40% MA and ZrO2 coatings linearly increases with the applied

load, as shown in Fig. 10. This is in good agreement with Amontons–
Coulomb model. By fitting a linear trend to the experimental
results, the friction coefficient calculated from the slope decreases

pure nickel one. The changes in the specific wear rate and friction
coefficient described above are only partially correlated with the
applied test conditions and properties of the materials, which can
produce dissimilar wear mechanisms during wear tests, and there-
fore dissimilar volume loss of coatings. These reasons have encour-
aged the investigation of the interaction between the pair
specimens-counterpart. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) ana-
lysis was conducted on the dissimilar worn surfaces of coatings in
order to identify the main wear mechanisms produced.

Typical SEM morphologies of worn surfaces of the coatings
tested with 8.5 N against a glass sphere are shown in Fig. 11.
Distinct wear mechanisms were identified in the worn surfaces. In
Ni and Ni+ZrO2 Dual coatings significant amount of adherent
material is shown in the wear scar, while Ni+ZrO2 MA and ZrO2
coatings show clean worn surfaces. EDS analysis performed in
adhered debris, marked in Fig. 12(a) and (b) by letters A and B,
allows concluding that they are made of silicon oxides and Ni,
suggesting a mechanical mixing by the friction process, joining the
softer Ni phase with the silica type wear debris from the ball wear.
Being softer, the compact wear debris can stick at the worn track
as well as at the ball wear scar, as can be observed in Fig. 13.
During contact the friction generated by the movement of the
counterpart against the surface specimen, causes an increase of
temperature promoting local plastic deformation. At this time,
both materials will adhere to each other. In the wear track of the
Ni coating, see Fig. 12(a), the wear debris tend to be incorporated
in the specimens, more precisely in the boundaries of the semi-
melted powders, remaining adherent and leading to removal of
material. This mechanism explains simultaneously the high fric-
tion values reported for Ni coating. On the other hand, ZrO2
coating shows clean wear scars without traces of adhered material.
The surface has a brittle appearance, where micro cracks can be
seen, as shown in Fig. 12(d), revealing a rough surface from which
particles of several tens of micrometers were detached. This
morphology suggests mechanical interlocking during the contact
which can explain the higher values of the friction coefficient.
Furthermore, it should promote a strong abrasion in the counter-
part, giving rise to much higher wear rate as shown in Fig. 8(b).
Moreover, the evolution of the wear amount with the increase of
normal load, (see Fig. 8), allow identifying a made severe wear
volume for loads higher than 7 N, which should be correlated to a
transition for a made brittle behavior. Similar behavior was
observed by Chen et al. [29] during the evaluation of
un-lubricated wear properties of plasma-sprayed nanostructures
and conventional zirconia coatings. The wear scars of Ni+ZrO2
Fig. 13. Optical micrograph of the ball wear scars tested against the Ni coating with
7 N of load.
Dual coatings show a mix morphology of pure Ni and ZrO2
coatings, i.e. adhered debris can be observed over a rough
brittle-appearance surface, whose number decreases with nanos-
tructured zirconia additions. In these coatings, zirconia particles
are localized in the boundaries of the semi-melted Ni-based
powders (see Fig. 4c and d). Despite of the particles operating as
reinforcement of the coatings, leading to a lower volume loss, the
area of the nickel exposed to the glass sphere remains higher.
Therefore, it is expected similar debris adhesion as for Ni coating.
At the same time, due to the continuous removal of material, ZrO2
particles in the boundaries of the semi-melted powders loses their
support capacity being removed from the boundaries. These
particles will slide through the wear track acting as a removal of
the wear debris. Increasing the volume of nanostructured zirconia
from 20 to 40%, higher levels of brittleness in the boundaries are
achieved, increasing the volume loss of material, as reported
before, and giving rise to the rough and brittle appearance shown
below the adhered debris. The higher level of porosity of these
coatings also accounts for higher levels of volume loss of material.

The coatings produced from MA powders show also clean wear
surfaces but with a different failure type from pure zirconia coating. Ni
+ZrO2 MA coatings reveal surfaces with scratches identifying some
sort of grooving abrasion, see Fig. 12(c). The uniform distribution of
small nanostructured zirconia particles and the higher hardness and
toughness of these coatings avoids the plastic deformation, the
adhesion and the liberation of large wear debris either from the
coating or the counterpart. The smooth worn surfaces can be in the
basis of the low friction coefficient [30]. In these coatings, the matrix
cutting occurs through a process of two body abrasion, as shown
Fig. 12(c). Despite of the dissimilar wear mechanisms observed in the
wear track of the coatings, during the wear tests it was observed that
most of the material resulting from the wear was blown out, due to
the movement of the ball.
4. Conclusions
?
 The influence of nanostructured zirconia additions on the
microstructure, micro-hardness and wear performance of a
nickel-based hardfacing alloy deposited by atmospheric
plasma spraying (APS) on low carbon steel is reported in the
present paper.
?
 The coatings containing nanostructured zirconia additions
were produced either using powders prepared by mechanical
alloying or using separate powders that are sprayed simulta-
neously via a dual system of powder injection.
?
 Nanostructured zirconia can be successfully incorporated into
nickel-based alloy powders by mechanical alloying. Coatings
produced with these powders present evenly distributed zir-
conia as opposed to coatings produced by separate powder
injection, where the nanostructured zirconia particles were
entrapped in the boundaries of the semi-melted Ni lamellae.
?
 The microstructure of the nickel coating consists mainly of Ni,
Ni–Cr–Fe, Cr23C6 and Cr5B3 phases. The same diffraction lines
were identified in the modified nickel coatings with tetragonal
zirconia, independently of the procedure used in depositions.
?
 The hardness and wear behavior of coatings was improved
with nanostructured zirconia additions while the friction
coefficient is decreased.

 The nanostructured ZrO2 coating shows the highest hardness
values but also the highest specific wear rate, one to two orders
of magnitude higher than the other prepared coatings, in
particular those deposited with MA powders.

In  the  last  years,  vanadium  rich  films  have  been  introduced  as  possible  candidates  for  self-lubrication
at  high  temperatures,  based  on  the  formation  of  V2O5 oxide.  The  aim  of  this  investigation  was  to  study
the effect of  V  additions  on  the  structure,  mechanical  properties  and  oxidation  resistance  of  Ti–Si–V–N
coatings  deposited  by  DC  reactive  magnetron  sputtering.  The  results  achieved  for TiSiVN  films  were com-
pared  and  discussed  in  relation  to TiN  and  TiSiN  films  prepared  as  reference.  All  coatings  presented  a  fcc
NaCl-type  structure.  A  shift  of  the  diffraction  peaks  to higher  angles  with  increasing  Si  and  V  contents
suggested  the  formation  of  a  substitutional  solid  solution  in  TiN  phase.  Hardness  and  Young’s  modulus
of the  coatings  were  similar  regardless  on V  content.  The  onset  of  oxidation  of the  films  decreased  sig-
nificantly  to 500 ?C when  V  was added  into  the  films;  this  behaviour  was  independent  of  the Si  and  V
xidation resistance
anadium oxide

contents. The  thermogravimetric  isothermal  curves  of  TiSiVN  coatings  oxidized  at  temperatures  below
the melting  point  of  ?-V2O5 (?685 ?C)  showed  two  stages:  at an  early  stage,  the  weight  increase  over
time  is  linear,  whilst,  in  the second  stage,  a parabolic  evolution  can  be fitted  to  the  experimental  data.  At
higher  temperatures  only  a  parabolic  evolution  was  fitted.  ?-V2O5 was  the  main  phase  detected  at  the
oxidized  surface  of  the coatings.  Reduction  of  ?-V2O5 to  ?-V2O5 phase  occurred  for  temperatures  above

its melting  point.

. Introduction

High-speed cutting and dry machining processes without the
se of environmental harmful lubrication requires milling tools
apable to withstand severe conditions of wear, friction, oxidation
nd corrosion [1,2]. Solid lubricants coatings, such as WC/C, MoS2,
iamond-like carbon (DLC), hex-BN as well as their combinations

n nanocrystaline or multilayer structures, have been successfully
pplied in such parts in order to increase their lifetime and perfor-
ance for various tribological applications. However, considerable

egradation of the tribological effectiveness of these coatings at ele-
ated temperature has been reported due to their low resistance to
xidation [3–5]. To overcome this shortcoming, a new concept of
ubrication based on the formation of lubricious oxides has been

roposed. This is the case of the so-called Magnéli oxide phases
ased on Ti, Si, Mo,  W and V, which have easy shear able planes
3,6]. Among these elements, particular attention has been given

to the vanadium-containing coatings (Magnéli phases VnO3n?1),
which showed interesting tribological properties in the temper-
ature range 500–700 ?C [3,7–12]. Dissimilar series of V-based hard
coatings have been developed, such as ternary CrVN [13], (V,Ti)N
[14], multilayer AlN/VN [15] and quaternary single layer or mul-
tilayered CrAlVN [16,17] and TiAlVN [2,8,18,19]. However, since
other ternary coatings systems, based on (TiX)N with X = B, Cr, Al,
Si, Cr, etc, have been attractive for advanced hard coating materi-
als, the effect of vanadium doping to these systems should also be
considered.

Among those ternary systems, most of the research works have
been focused on TiSiN coatings deposited by CVD and/or PVD tech-
niques [20,21]. Depending on the deposition conditions, these coat-
ings could be deposited with a nanocomposite structure, consisting
of nano-sized TiN crystallites surrounded by an amorphous matrix
of Si3N4 displaying very high hardness values [22], compared to any
other ternary (TiX)N compound, with extremely good oxidation
resistance [23,24]. In other deposition conditions, substitutional

solid solution of Si in TiN structure (not predicted by the Ti–Si–N
phase diagram) could be achieved [22,25,26]. Relatively to the
friction coefficient of Ti–Si–N coatings, the studies have reported
values in the range [0.6–1.3] at room and high temperatures

27–29]. Since the addition of V successfully decreased the friction
oefficient of binary and ternary systems (down to reported values
f 0.2–0.3 at temperatures between 550 and 700 ?C), similar studies
n the effect of V-addition should be performed on TiSiN coatings
xhibiting unique mechanical properties and oxidation resistance.

This paper reports the first results on the effect of increasing
anadium content to Ti–Si–V–N films deposited by DC reactive
agnetron sputtering. It is focused on coating structure, mechan-

cal properties and oxidation resistance. Comparison of the results
ith those achieved for reference TiN and TiSiN coatings is pre-

ented. The results of this study will support further research aimed
t the tribological behaviour of the coatings at high temperatures.

. Experimental procedure

Three series of TiSiN films with different Si contents, each
eries with increasing V contents (TiSiVN coatings), were deposited
n a d.c. reactive magnetron sputtering machine equipped with
wo rectangular (100 × 200 mm)  magnetron cathodes working in
nbalanced mode. A high purity Ti (99.9%) target, with 18 holes of
0 mm in diameter (uniformly distributed throughout the prefer-
ntial erosion zone of the target), and a high purity TiSi2 (99.9%)
omposite target were used in the depositions. The different sili-
on contents were achieved by changing the power density applied
o each target. The V content was varied by changing the number
f high purity rods of Ti and V (with 10 mm in diameter) placed in
he holes of the Ti target. 4, 8 and 12 cylindrical pieces of vanadium
ere used. In all the cases the total power applied to the targets was

et to 1500 W.  To serve as reference, a stoichiometric TiN coating
as deposited from the Ti target. Hereinafter the coatings will be
esignated as Sx-y, where x is related to the specific power applied
o the TiSi2 target (see Table 1), and therefore associated to the
i content on the coatings, and y the number of V rods used in
he depositions, giving an indication of V content in each series of
iSiVN films. Thus, denomination S2-0, S2-4, S2-8 and S2-12 rep-
esents coatings from the same series, i.e. with identical Si content
TiSi2 target power 1.5 W/cm2), with increasing V content from 0
p to a maximum content achieved for the coating produced using
2 vanadium pellets embedded into the Ti target.

Polished high-speed steel (AISI M2)  (Ø 20 × 3 mm,  for mechani-
al properties measurements), FeCrAl alloy and alumina substrates

10 × 10 × 1 mm,  for oxidation tests and structural analysis), stain-
ess steel discs (Ø 20 × 1 mm,  for residual stress measurements)
nd (1 1 1) silicon samples (10 × 10 × 0.8 mm,  for thickness mea-
urements and chemical composition evaluation) were used as

substrates. Prior to the depositions, all the substrates were ultra-
sonically cleaned in acetone for 15 min  and alcohol for 10 min. The
substrates were mounted in a substrate holder (which revolved
with 18 rev/min around the centre axis) giving a target to sub-
strate distance of 175 mm.  Prior to deposition, the chamber was
evacuated down to 8.7 × 10?4 Pa and the substrates were etched
with Ar ion sputtering during 1 h with a bias voltage of ?650 V to
remove any surface contaminants. In order to enhance the adhesion
of the coatings, Ti and TiN adhesion layers of approximately 0.24
and 0.45 ?m, respectively, were deposited on the substrates before
TiSi(V)N coatings. In all the depositions, the total working gas pres-
sure was kept constant at 0.3 Pa, using approximately 30 sccm of
Ar and 17 sccm of N2. The depositions were performed with a neg-
ative substrate bias of 50 V. The deposition time was  set in order to
obtain films with approximately 2.5 ?m of total thickness (includ-
ing interlayers). The deposition parameters are shown in Table 1.

The chemical composition of the coatings was  evaluated by
electron probe microanalysis (EPMA—Cameca SX 50). Crystallo-
graphic structure was investigated by X-ray diffraction (X’ Pert
Pro MPD  diffractometer) using a grazing incidence angle of 1? and
Cu K?1 radiation (? = 1.54060 A?). The XRD spectra were fitted by
using a pseudo-Voigt function to calculate either the full width
at half maximum (FWHM) and the peak position (2?). The frac-
ture cross-section morphology and the thickness of the films were
investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Further, pro-
filometer was used to confirm coating thickness and to evaluate
surface roughness.

The hardness and Young’s modulus of films were measured in
a nano-indentation equipment (Micro Materials NanoTest) using a
Berkovich diamond pyramid indenter. In order to avoid the effect
of the substrate, the applied load (10 mN)  was selected to keep
the indentation depth less than 10% of the coating’ thickness. 32
measurements were performed in each sample. The level of resid-
ual stresses was calculated through the Stoney equation [30] by
measuring the bulk deflection of the film-substrate body.

The oxidation resistance of the coatings was evaluated by ther-
mogravimetric analysis (TGA) using industrial air (99.99% purity).
The films deposited on alumina substrates were firstly heated with
a constant temperature ramp of 20 ?C/min from room temperature
up to 1200 ?C, in order to determine the onset point of oxidation.
Then, coated specimens of FeCrAl alloy were subjected to isother-

mal  tests at different selected temperatures and time. The weight
gain of the samples was  evaluated at regular 2 s intervals using a
microbalance with an accuracy of 0.01 mg.  The air flux used was
50 ml/min and the heating rate up to the isothermal temperature

. Results and discussion

.1. Coatings characterization

.1.1. Chemical composition and microstructure
The elemental chemical composition of the coatings determined

y EPMA is shown in Table 2. As could be expected, the simulta-
eous decrease in the power density of Ti target and increase in the
ower density of TiSi2 target gave rise to higher Si content in the
oatings. Only insignificant variations were detected on the Si/Ti
atios with incorporation of V in the Ti target. The nitrogen content
f the coatings was close to 50 at.% regardless of Si and V.

The corresponding X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-deposited
oatings are displayed in Fig. 1. The influence of increasing V con-
ent on TiSiN coatings is shown in Fig. 1b) for the film with lower
i content, as representative of all series containing vanadium. In
ll graphs TiN film pattern is shown as a reference. In all cases, the
iffraction peaks could be generally assigned to the fcc NaCl-type
rystalline TiN phase. The XRD pattern of the TiN reference coating

eveals that all peaks are shifted to lower diffraction angles in rela-
ion to the standard ICDD card of TiN, probably indicating residual
ompressive stresses [31]. For TiSiN coatings with 3.8 and 6.7 at.%
f Si, (2 0 0) peak vanishes and the sharpening of the peaks suggests

larger grain size. Based on Scherrer’ equation, grain sizes of 16 and
24 nm were calculated for TiN and coatings with low Si content,
respectively. With further increase of the Si content (12.6 at.% of
Si) a strong decrease of the peaks intensity, as well as their signifi-
cant broadening (a grain size of 6 nm was  calculated), are observed
suggesting a decrease of crystallinity. With increasing Si content,
the fcc peaks are shifted to higher angles, behaviour associated to
a smaller unit cell. This can be explained by the presence of Si in
solid solution, since its smaller atomic radius promotes the con-
traction of the TiN lattice. Therefore, in this case the stoichiometric
phases (TiN + Si3N4) do not segregate and nanocomposite structure
is not formed. Such behaviour could be explained by the low depo-
sition temperature together with low substrate ion bombardment,
which do not provide the necessary mobility of the species for the
nanocomposite formation [22]. This observation is in agreement
with the results from the literature, where similar solid solutions
and changes in the film orientation have been observed with silicon
incorporation [21,25,32].

The coatings with V displayed similar XRD patterns and peaks
to TiSiN. No significant changes in the peaks intensities or widths
were observed, except for the highest Si content films where a
small improvement in the crystallinity was  detected. All the vana-
dium containing films had the XRD peaks shifted to higher angles,
behaviour, once again, related to a smaller unit cell due to the sub-
stitution of Ti by the smaller V atoms. Similar trend was  observed
by Pfeiler et al. [2] for the TiAlVN system.

Fig. 2 displays typical surface and fracture cross section-
micrographs of TiSiVN coatings. All coatings showed a typical
columnar structure. As Si content was increased (see Fig. 2b)) for
coating S1-0), the columns size and the surface roughness were
firstly reduced, for silicon contents of 3.8 and 6.7 at.%, and then
increased for the highest silicon content, which is an opposite
trend than that observed for the grain size. The addition of V did
not change the global type of columnar morphology and the coat-
ing cross-section was similar. The only exception was the strong
increase of the size of the columns as well as the surface roughness
(see Fig. 2c) for coating S1-12) for low silicon content coatings.

3.1.2. Hardness, Young’s modulus and residual stresses
The dependence of the hardness and Young’ modulus on the

Si and V content is shown in Fig. 3. As the silicon content in the
TiSiN films increases, the hardness of coatings reached a maximum
value of 27 GPa at a Si content of 6.7 at%; then it dropped with fur-
ther increasing Si content to a lower value than the reference TiN.
Although the grain grow is observed with increasing Si additions
up to 6.7 at% of Si, the hardening of coatings is mostly result of the
nitride lattice distortion, which improves the resistance to plastic
deformation (solid solution hardening). Residual stresses should
not be a factor of hardness differentiation between the coatings,
since all films have approximately the same level of compressive
residual stresses, with any Si addition (?3 GPa). This result also sup-
ports what was stated above that the shift of the peaks to the right
with Si additions is exclusively due to substitutional solid solu-
tion. The decrease in hardness with further Si addition is due to
the loss of crystallinity associated with the lower degree of phase
nitriding regardless on the lower grain size [26]. Young’s modu-
lus progressively decreases with increasing Si content, which is
related to changes in the binding energy between ions due to Si
incorporations. Similar hardness and Young’s modulus evolution
as a function of Si content has been reported in Refs [25,33].

Concerning the effect of V addition on the hardness and Young’
modulus, similar evolution was  observed for all films (see e.g.

Fig. 3b) for S1-y films). Although the variations are very small and
often within the error bars of the hardness values, general trend is
a slight increase in hardness followed by drop for the highest vana-
dium content. Coatings with the higher silicon content and with

anadium additions displayed lower hardness and Young’s modu-
us values as compared to the other V rich coatings. The hardness
nhance with V additions is probably due to the presence of V in
olid solution. In fact, the similar level of residual stresses as func-
ion of V content measured, which revealed to be from the range
f 3–4 GPa, and the observed shift of peaks to higher angles with V
ncorporation, supports the previous affirmation.

.2. Continuous and isothermal oxidation in air

The effect of increasing Si and V content on the onset point of
xidation of the TiN and TiSiN systems, respectively, are shown in
ig. 4. Silicon incorporation strongly improved the onset of oxida-
ion of the coatings, with the highest silicon content (S3-0) showing
he highest oxidation resistance. Kacsich et al. [34,35] reported that
he high oxidation resistance of these coatings was due to the pres-
nce of a protective silicon-rich oxide layer. This layer acted as an
fficient diffusion barrier against oxygen and metal ions diffusion;
hus, it protected the coating from further oxidation. Our results
howed that the onset point of oxidation of films decreased sig-
ificantly down to a temperature of approximately 500 ?C (lower
han TiN) for all coatings containing vanadium. Interestingly, this
ehaviour was independent of Si content of the films and, there-
ore, the vanadium incorporation interfered with the diffusion of
ilicon and the consequent formation of a continuous protective
ilicon oxide layer. Furthermore, all V-containing coatings were
ompletely oxidized at a lower temperature than TiN film. Lewis
t al. [7], Zhou et al. [36], and Franz et al. [37], who studied the effect
f V doping on the oxidation behaviour of multilayered TiAlN/VN
nd CrAlVN coatings, respectively, also observed a similar decrease
n the onset point of oxidation. In order to better characterize the
xidation behaviour of the V rich coatings, isothermal oxidation
ests were conducted at selected temperatures using S2-8 coating
eposited onto FeCrAl alloy substrates. The isothermal curves were
ompared with those of TiSiN coating with similar Si content and
ith TiN (see Fig. 5).

Comparing the mass gain of the coatings and taking into account
he testing temperature in each case, it is possible to conclude that
-free TiSiN coating (S2-0 tested at 900 ?C) is much more resistant

o oxidation. This coating exhibits a typical parabolic oxidation
eight gain as a function of time indicating the formation of
rotective silicon-rich oxide layer, as referred to above. Similar
ype of evolution is exhibited by TiN coating; however, in this case

he titanium oxide scale does not protect the coatings and, thus,
t is effective only at low isothermal temperature [38]. It should
e remarked that during continuous oxidation test up to 1200 ?C,
t 900 ?C TiN coatings was already half consumed. Regarding the

10.3 ± 0.1 24.9 ± 0.9 10.4 ± 0.1

isothermal curves of TiSiN coating with V additions (S2-8), it can
be concluded that, independently of the isothermal temperature
and time of exposure, their mass gain is always much higher than
TiN and V-free TiSiN coatings (S2-0). The isothermal curves tested
at 550 and 600 ?C showed two  steps: at an early stage, the weight
gain is rapidly increasing almost linearly up to approximately
0.1 mg/cm2 (particularly at 600 ?C), whereas in the second stage,
a parabolic evolution can be fitted. Isothermal annealing of S2-8
at 700 ?C shows significant increase of mass gain following the
parabolic evolution.

3.2.1. Surface structure
As it would be expected, both TiN annealed at 600 ?C and S2-0

coating annealed at 900 ?C exhibited several intense peaks belong-
ing to the (1 1 0), (1 0 1), (2 0 0), (1 1 1) and (2 1 0) of a tetragonal
phase related to rutile/TiO2 (ICDD card 76-0649) (not shown here).
Weak peaks assigned to TiN (ICDD card 87-0628) were observed
in the XRD spectra of the S2-0 coating, which was in a good agree-
ment with its annealing curve, since only partial oxidation of the
film was expected. Moreover, diffraction peaks associated with Si
oxide were not detected on the oxidized surface of S2-0 film sug-
gesting an amorphous character of the protective oxide layer. This
result is in agreement with literature, where similar observation
was  reported [34,35].

XRD patterns of S2-8 oxidized coatings in isothermal tests are
shown in Fig. 6. The main phases detected by XRD were Ti–V–O
and V–O oxides; however, depending on the isothermal temper-
ature and time, different orientations and peaks assigned to V–O
were perceived. After annealing at 550 ?C during 1 h, the follow-
ing phases could be identified: Ti(V)O2 (ICDD card 77-0332) and
?-V2O5 (ICDD card 41-1426) with a preferred orientation follow-
ing the (0 0 1) plane (peak at 20.3?), together with the f.c.c. nitride
from the coating. The same phases were detected at 600 ?C during
10 min, however, ?-V2O5 phase showed random orientation. Fur-
ther increase in isothermal time (annealing at 600 ?C during 30 min)
resulted in loss of TiN peaks and the orientation of the ?-V2O5 phase
is again following (0 0 1) plane. The absence of TiN peaks is in good
agreement with the isothermal curve shown in Fig. 5. Progressive
oxidation is demonstrated in the intensity of (0 0 1) reflection after
30 min  of annealing, where the amount of ?-V2O5 is clearly higher.
These changes in phase proportion and orientation have already
been observed by several authors during the oxidation of TiAlN/VN
multilayer and TiAlVN single layered coatings [1,7,8,36]. Increas-

ing the heat treatment to 700 ?C, which is temperature higher than
the melting point of ?-V2O5 (?685 ?C [10,36]), resulted in the ran-
dom orientation of this phase; moreover, a sharp peak at 2? = 12.8?

identified as ?-V2O5 (ICDD card 45-1074) with (0 0 2) preferential

orientation appearing [39]. ?-V2O5 phase is a result of loss of O
from ?-V2O5, due to a reduction process [40]. We  should empha-
size here that vanadium oxides observed on the oxidized surface are
optimal from the tribological point of view. Vanadium oxide could
acts as low-friction solid lubricant or, for higher temperatures, as
liquid lubricant. Therefore the drop in onset oxidation tempera-
ture should not be considered as a significant drawback of TiSiVN
coatings.

heir composition. On the oxidized surface of the S2-0 film, two  dif-
erent zones could be detected, a dark grey phase evenly distributed
hroughout the surface and white islands. EDS analysis showed that

the white oxide was  rich in Ti (crystals of TiO2), and the dark grey
phase composed mainly by Si and Ti. The Raman spectra of these
zones are plotted in Fig. 9. As can be observed the light grey phase
displays Raman active modes at 152, 253, 454 and 610 cm?1 [3,23]
assigned to rutile, confirming its presence in the oxidized coating
detected by XRD. The same phase, with much less intensity, was
detected for the dark grey phase; however, strong additional peaks
assigned to anatase (TiO2) were observed. This finding corroborates
the report of Pilloud et al. [23], who  showed that anatase Raman
bands increased with the silicon content in TiSiN films, whereas
that of rutile decreased. As only strong peaks of rutile were detected
by XRD, this indicates that the amount of anatase should be small
and, therefore, not detectable by XRD diffraction. Since Raman pen-
etration depth is relatively limited, the absence of silicon oxide in
Raman spectra indicated that Si–O was  below theTiO2 phase iden-
tified by XRD. This finding corroborates the results of Kacsich et al.
[34,35]; they observed titanium oxide layer formed at outmost sur-
face and silicon oxide sublayer (TiSiN coatings).

The analysis of the oxidized surface of S2-8 coating reveals that
the surface oxide morphology is different from that of coating S2-
0. It displays a floret-like structure formed by light and dark grey
zones. At 550 ?C these phases are tiny distributed throughout the
surface, being difficult to clearly identify the boundaries between
them. At a temperature of 600 ?C, the separation between both
zones is evident with the shape of darker zone suggesting some type
of dendritic growth. With the increase of the isothermal time, an
increase in the area covered by the grey dark phase was observed.
The temperature 700 ?C led to a different oxide morphology, i.e.
the appearance of a black zone in some rosettes and the segrega-
tion of a white phase to the boundaries of the floret-like structure.
This change in the microstructure can be associated to the melting
of ?-V2O5, which originates a smoother surface (Fig. 8d)). Fig. 10
shows examples of EDS spectra of points identified in Fig. 8 (phases
1 and 2). As can be observed, Ti K? peak (4.931 keV) overlaps the V
K? peak (4.952 keV) and, therefore, V K? peak should be taken in
consideration for analyzing V importance. In order to identify the
different oxide phases marked in Fig. 8, the ratio between the peaks
intensities of V K? (Si K?) and Ti K? from EDS analyses are sum-
marized in Table 3. To a relative increase in this ratio corresponds
the preferential formation of the oxide of that element. EDS analy-
ses of points 1 and 2 reveal similar compositions for the grey light
and dark zones, suggesting the presence of oxides containing Ti, Si
and V. However, darker phase has clearly a higher V content (see
Table 3). The Raman spectrum taken at grey dark phase (see Fig. 11)
shows the presence of intense peaks assigned to ?-V2O5 [3,8,10]
and small peaks related to rutile (TiO2). On light grey phase the
spectrum is much less defined, with broader bands. ?-V2O5 peaks
almost vanished whereas rutile bands are enhanced. Low crystal-
lized Ti–O phases give very similar Raman spectra, which evolve,
after annealing, either as anatase or rutile [41,42] phases. In sum-
mary, the dark grey phase can be assigned mainly to ?-V2O5, and
small quantities of TiO2, probably as a bilayer with ?-V2O5 on the
top and TiO2 underneath, as suggested by EDS measurements. In
fact, the high ratio of V/Ti of point 3 marked in Fig. 8, allows iden-
tifying a V-rich oxide, on the surrounding regions of the dark grey
phase. The light grey phase should be attributed to low crystallized
Ti(V)O2. These results agree to the XRD results acquired on the oxi-
dized surface of the films where both Ti(V)O2 and ?-V2O5 phases
were indexed. When the isothermal time was prolonged from 10 to
30 min  at 600 ?C, the increase of the intensity of the ?-V2O5 peak
observed in the XRD patterns was is in a good agreement with a
higher amount of grey dark phase observed on the oxidized surface

morphology.

Similarly to S2-0 coating signals from Si–O oxide were neither
detected by XRD nor by Raman spectroscopy. However, according
to EDS analysis this oxide should be present. As these signals are

coming from a sub-surface layer, an oxide layer rich in Ti and Si
should coexist with a global chemical composition similar to that
of light grey phase.

From the three different morphological zones of sample
annealed at 700 ?C for 10 min  (Fig. 8d)), EDS analysis showed that
the two grey phases were mainly rich in vanadium and oxygen. Sig-
nals of elements from the substrate were detected in the dark phase,
particularly Al, which in conjunction with XRD results, allowed
identifying it as ?-V2O5. In fact, it is well known, that the loss of O
from ?-V2O5, due to a reduction process, leads to its transformation
in ?-V2O5 [40,43]. The presence of highly oxygen reactive elements,
such as aluminium, in the substrate can reduce the molten ?-V2O5,
subtracting O and promoting the formation of ?-V2O5. The Raman
spectra of the dark and light grey phases plotted in Fig. 12 show
similar Raman patterns with peaks related to V2O5. Both ?- and
?-V2O5 display similar Raman spectra [44]. The segregated white
areas located at the boundaries of the grey phase (see ratio Si/Ti of
point 5) were rich in Si and Ti, suggesting to be silicon and titanium

oxides.

A good correlation was found between the isothermal oxida-
tion curve, XRD measurements and surface morphology of S2-8
coating. At temperatures below the melting point of ?-V2O5, the

sothermal oxidation curve starts with a linear increase in the mass
ain and then changes to a parabolic law. The XRD spectra of spec-
men S2-8 oxidized during 10 min  at 600 ?C, in the first stage of
he oxidation process, revealed the presence of intense peaks of
-V2O5. Further increase in isothermal time to 30 min  showed an

ncreased amount of ?-V2O5, as confirmed by the increase of the
rey dark phase, above attributed to V-rich zones. XRD pattern
or this sample also showed an increase in Ti(V)O2 peaks inten-
ity suggesting a thickening of the oxide scale. Therefore, the first
inear part of the isothermal curve is due to the oxidation of both
itanium and vanadium to form Ti(V)O2 and ?-V2O5, respectively.
-V2O5 is a non-protective oxide and Ti(V)O2 is still not in enough
mounts to form a continuous protective scale, reason why a linear

xidation rate is observed. For longer oxidation times, the progres-
ive thickening of the Ti-rich oxide scale will make difficult the
xygen diffusion inward retarding the reaction and promoting the
arabolic behaviour. However, the protection is not so efficient

as in TiN and/or Ti–Si–N samples (see Fig. 5) due to the disrup-
tion induced by the outward/lateral diffusion of V ions through the
oxide scale. In any condition the protective Si–O layer could be also
formed. Similar isothermal evolution was reported by Zhou et al.
[36], which during isothermal oxidation of multilayered TiAlN/VN
coatings have detected ?-V2O5 at the initial stage of oxidation.
In their system, the mass gain curves also showed initially a lin-
ear evolution, followed by a parabolic growth, similar to what
was  observed here for TiSiVN films. Keller and Douglass [45] also
showed that pure vanadium oxidizes linearly, whereas the addition
of different elements (Al, Cr, Ti) could transform the initial linear
mass gain for a parabolic one due to the modification of the formed
oxide layer.

At 700 ?C, temperature higher than the melting point of ?-
V2O5, very high oxidation rates were measured and high amounts
of V-oxides were detected by XRD. The extremely high parabolic
evolution suggests a very high diffusion rate of the reactive ions
through the oxide scales.

A comparison between TiSiVN with CrAlVN and TiAlVN (in
single layered or multilayered configuration) coatings, reveals a
lower onset point of oxidation of approximately 100 ?C. In CrAlVN
and TiAlVN coatings the onset point of oxidation was  close to
?600 ?C [8,36,37]. In the case of the TiAlVN films, signals of lubri-
cious ?-V2O5 were detected as soon as the oxidation started,
while at high temperatures only AlVO4 and TiO2 were identi-
fied [8]. For CrAlVN coatings, AlVO4, (Al, Cr, V)2O3 as well as
?-V2O5 oxides were observed for an annealing temperature of
700 ?C [37]. In these studies, the lower onset point of oxidation
displayed by the V-containing coatings was explained by the reac-
tions occurring between protective oxides and vanadium (such as
formation of Al–V–O phases). In the present TiSiVN system com-
bination of V with titanium or silicon oxide was not detected.
Therefore, we  suggest that the loss of oxidation resistance of
TiSiVN coatings is due to the rapid oxidation of V and the out-
wards diffusion of its ions through the Ti-rich oxide scale. Further
work is needed to understand the mechanisms involved during
the oxidation deterioration of TiSiN coatings with V additions
and their corresponding oxide scale formation. The performance
of solid solution coatings for high temperature sliding applica-
tion should be investigated in further work. Rapid formation of
vanadium oxide could indeed reduce friction at temperatures
higher than 500 ?C; nonetheless, the wear resistance of the coat-
ing can be significantly compromised by low oxidation resistance.

In future research, we propose to deposit nanocomposite struc-
ture of TiSiVN combining nanograins of c-TiVN embedded into
amorphous Si–N matrix, to control the outwards diffusion of
vanadium.

. Conclusion

This investigation concerned the influence of V additions on
he structure, mechanical properties and oxidation resistance of
i–Si–V–N coatings deposited by DC reactive magnetron sput-
ering. These coatings were compared to TiN and TiSiN films.
ccording to XRD analyses, all coatings showed an fcc NaCl-type
tructure assigned to crystalline TiN. A shift of the peaks to the
ight was observed with Si and V additions, indicative of a substitu-
ional solid solution. Hardness and Young modulus of TiSiN coatings
as insignificantly changed with increasing V content. The onset of

xidation of the coatings decreased with V additions down to tem-
eratures as low as 500 ?C, independently of the Si and V content in
he coatings. TiN and TiSiN coating exhibits a typical parabolic oxi-
ation weight gain as a function of time, while a different evolution

s displayed by TiSiVN films. At temperatures below the melting
oint of ?-V2O5 (?685 ?C) two stages were exhibited: at an early
tage, the weight increase over time is linear, whilst, in a second
tage a parabolic evolution could be fitted to the experimental data;
n the other hand, at high temperatures only a parabolic evolution
as fitted. ?-V2O5 showed to be the main phase present at the

xidized surface of coatings. Reduction of this phase occurred for
emperatures above their melting point. The relative amounts of
2O5 detected at the oxidized surface of V rich films are promising

o achieve the envisaged good tribological properties; however it
an be significantly compromised by their low oxidation resistance.

Abstract 

 

The effect of V additions on oxidation resistance, oxide scale formation and diffusion 

processes for TiSiVN system and their comparison to TiSiN is investigated. A dual layer 

oxide was formed in the case of TiSiN coating with a protective Si-O layer at an 

oxide/coating interface; however, in zones of film defects a complex oxide structure was 

developed. V additions increased the oxidation rate of the coatings as a result of the inversion 

of the oxidation mechanism due to ions diffusion throughout the oxide scale, which inhibited 

the formation of a continuous protective silicon oxide layer. 

 

Keywords: TiSiVN system, structural evolution, oxidation, oxide scale, diffusion processes 

 

1. Introduction 

 

TiSiN solid solution or nanocomposite coatings are well established in applications 

like high speed cutting and dry machining processes due to their excellent oxidation resistance 

and high hardness. However, the main drawback of the aforementioned coating system is their 

high friction coefficient, typically in the range of 0.6 - 1.3 at room and high temperatures [1]. 

Recently, the formation of thin reaction films in sliding contacts has provided the basis for 

development of adaptive, self-lubricating coatings guaranteeing low friction at high 

temperature. Magnéli phase oxides based on Ti, Si, Mo, W and V, with low shear strength

have attracted the scientific community and particular attention has been given to vanadium 

oxide. The beneficial influence of Magnéli oxides formed by oxidation of vanadium on the 

friction has already been reported for ternary CrVN [2], (V,Ti)N [3], multilayer AlN/VN [4], 

quaternary single layer or multilayered CrAlVN [5-6], and TiAlVN [7-8] systems. Recently 

we have reported the effect of V incorporation on the structure, mechanical properties and 

oxidation resistance of TiSiVN films deposited by DC reactive magnetron sputtering [9]. 

Lubricious vanadium oxides have been successfully detected on the oxidized surface of these 

films. Here we show the thermal stability, oxide formation and, particularly, diffusion 

processes during annealing of TiSiVN films deposited by magnetron sputtering. 

 

2. Experimental procedure 

 

TiSiN and TiSiVN coatings with approximately the same silicon content and about 2.5 

µm of total thickness, were deposited on FeCrAl alloy substrates by a d.c. reactive magnetron 

sputtering machine equipped with two rectangular, Ti (99.9%) and TiSi2 (99.9%), magnetron 

cathodes working in unbalanced mode. V incorporation was achieved by inserting 8 pellets of 

vanadium into the erosion zone of Ti target. In both cases Ti and TiN adhesion layers were 

deposited as bonding layers improving coating to substrate adhesion. The interlayer also 

contained V when V pellets are placed in the Ti target. A detail description of the deposition 

conditions is reported elsewhere [9]. Temperature effect on the structure of the V rich coating 

was characterized by in-situ hot-XRD analysis in the range from 500 ºC up to 750 ºC, in open 

air, using a grazing incidence angle of 2º and Co K? radiation (1.789010 Å). Between each 

selected temperature a step of 10 min holding time was allowed for thermal stabilization and 

30 min time acquisition was used. Oxidation of films was assessed by thermogravimetric 

analysis (TGA) using industrial air (99.99% purity). The coatings were isothermal tested at 

different selected temperatures and times, based on the thermogravimetric oxidation curves of 

films performed at constant linear-temperature ramp (RT to 1200?C at 20?C/min) shown in 

reference [9]. These isothermal tests were performed having in consideration the temperatures 

where the oxidation showed takes mainly place. After annealing, the cross section thin foils of 

oxidized films was prepared by focused ion beam (FIB) and analyzed by transmission 

electron microscope (TEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive x-ray (EDS) spectroscopy 

system.

3. Results and discussion 

 

3.1. Phase evolution during annealing (in situ) 

 

The investigated coatings with chemical composition of Ti0.80Si0.13N and 

Ti0.65Si0.11V0.14N showed a typical columnar morphology and fcc NaCl-type structure 

assigned to crystalline TiN with Si and V in solid solution [9]. Fig. 1 plots the high 

temperature in-situ XRD spectra evolution for TiSiVN coating together with as deposited and 

cooled state patterns acquired at room temperature (RT). The first signs of oxides were 

detected at 500 ºC and identified as rutile type phase with V in solid solution, the Ti(V)O2 

(ICDD card 77-0332). Further increase in temperature to 550 ºC led to an increase of the 

Ti(V)O2 peaks intensity and the appearance of a new phase: the ?-V2O5 (ICDD card 41-1426) 

oxide with orthorhombic symmetry (peak at 23.6º). At 600 ºC a strong increase in intensity of 

the ?-V2O5 oxide peaks with a strong preferred orientation following the (001) plane was 

observed (peak at 23.5º). Moreover, a metastable phase was formed, ?-V2O5, as a result of 

oxygen loss from ?-V2O5 due to a reduction process [10]. It should be also pointed out that 

the higher intensity of V2O5 peaks in relation to other peaks suggests higher quantity on the 

oxidized volume. The temperature increase to 650 ºC led to TiN peaks vanishing suggesting 

the formation of a thick oxide scale. At 675 ºC, the peaks associated with the V2O5 phases 

disappeared, which was in a good agreement with the melting point of V2O5 oxide (reported 

in the range of 670 – 685 ºC [11]). On the other hand, peaks related to a V3O5 phase, which 

resulted from the ?-V2O5 reduction, were found. In fact, in case of oxygen deficiency, a shift 

to lower valence state leads to the formation of reduced oxides, such as V3O5 identified in the 

current XRD pattern. Further increase in temperature resulted mostly in the increase of V3O5 

peaks intensities due to continuous reduction of liquid V2O5 phase. Ti(V)O2, V3O5, V2O3 and 

VO reduced phases were found after annealing, as well as a new polymorph V2O5 oxide: ?’- 

V2O5 (ICDD card 85-2422). This oxide has an orthorhombic structure as ?-V2O5 phase, but 

with different diffraction planes. These changes could be attributed to distortions on the 

structure motivated by the cooling of liquid-phase. Double chains exist in both phases, but 

VO5 pyramids alternate up and down individually for ?’- V2O5, whereas they alternate by 

pairs for normal ?-V2O5 phase [12].

3.2. Isothermal oxidation in air, surface morphology and characterization 

 

TiSiN film was annealed at 900 
0
C for 1 hour, TiSiVN coating was annealled at two 

different isothermal temperatures. The results of the thermo gravimetric analysis are presented 

in Fig. 2 a). As expected, TiSiN film is much more resistant to oxidation, showing a typical 

parabolic oxidation weight gain as a fuction of time, which indicates the presence of 

protective oxide scales. Vanadium addition to TiSiN film strongly reduced the oxidation 

resistance. The isothermal curves at 550 ºC and 600 ºC showed two steps: they started with a 

linear increase in mass gain and then followed with a parabolic evolution. The surface 

morphologies of the oxidized coatings are shown in Fig. 2 b-c) for coatings TiSiN tested at 

900 ºC and TiSiVN oxidized at 600 ºC, respectively. The detailed description of the surface 

oxide constitution, based on XRD diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and SEM-EDS analyses, 

can be found in our previous study [9]. Therefore we will only summarize here the main 

results to support investigation aimed at diffusion processes and described later. Annealed 

TiSiN film (see Fig. 2b) displayed two different surface features: white and dark gray islands 

evenly distributed on the surface. Raman analyses revealed that white phase was rutile (TiO2), 

while dark gray phase was a mixture of rutile and anatase. However, only rutile peaks were 

detected by XRD diffraction suggesting very limited amount of anatase in the dark gray 

islands. Furthermore, strong signals of Si were detected on dark zone by EDS. However, the 

signals of silicon oxide were neither detected by XRD nor by Raman spectroscopy indicating

amorphous character, which corroborates previous reports [13-14]. Silicon oxide was 

positioned below Ti-O rich layer. Different morphology and oxide phases were detected on 

the oxidized surface of TiSiVN coating. At 600 ºC, the film displayed a floret-like structure 

formed by light and dark gray phases. XRD diffraction showed the presence of ?-V2O5 and 

Ti(V)O2 oxides. Although EDS analysis revealed similar spectra for both phases, the much 

less intensity of the V peak on the light gray phase, and its conjugation with Raman analysis 

allowed identifying dark and light gray phases as ?-V2O5 and Ti(V)O2 oxides, respectively. 

Similar phases were detected at 550 ºC by XRD; however, only small dark gray areas were 

observed at the surface. These results match well with high temperature in-situ XRD 

diffractograms (Fig. 1), where these phases were indexed. Similar to TiSiN coating, the signal 

from Si-O phase was neither detected by XRD nor by Raman.

Figure 3 shows the growing mechanism of the V2O5 phase over the Ti(V)O2 oxide. 

Nucleation points of V2O5 started being formed over the oxidized surface, growing up by 

vanadium lateral diffusion as suggested by the V depleted white and V rich black regions 

marked in the SEM micrograph. In order to investigate the oxide scale films growth, TEM 

cross-sections were prepared by FIB from TiSiN and TiSiVN films annealed at 900 and 600 

ºC, respectively.

3.3. Cross section of oxidized surfaces by TEM and oxidation kinetics 

 

Fig. 4 and 5 displays the bright-field STEM images, associated elemental maps and 

scanning elemental profiles from cross section of oxidized TiSiN and TiSiVN coatings. In the 

case of TiSiN film a multilayer of oxides can be identified, being more complex close to the 

film defect (white zones) shown in Fig. 4a): (i) an outer Ti-rich layer comprised by shaped 

crystals with bigger size in the top of the film defect, zone corresponding to the white phase 

and, (ii) a Si-rich layer, which is itself divided in 3 layers on the zone around the defect, an 

intermediate layer containing Ti, sandwiched between two Ti-free layers, being the external 

porous and the internal one very compact. Far from the film defect (left zone of the 

micrograph), below to the TiO2 crystals only a homogeneous Si-rich layer was observed. The 

measured elemental cross-section depth profiles for two lines were plotted in Fig. 4b) and 4c), 

respectively. The profiles corroborated STEM/EDX elemental mapping showing in detail the 

composition of surface oxides. The surface layer formed exclusively of Ti-O was followed by 

a Si-rich layer with scattering in the signals intensity, in agreement with brightness intensity 

in figures 4 a). It is clear in Ti-signal a small increase in intensity in the zone of high-Si 

content. This variation is more intense in line 2 than in line 1, suggesting an influence of the 

film defect, which is closer to line 2. Continuous and compact Si-O layer at the oxide/coating

interface acts as an efficient barrier against oxygen and metal ions diffusion and thus 

protecting the coating from further oxidation [13-14]. 

It is evident that Ti oxide forms first on the surface of the film due to the higher 

affinity of Ti for O than Si [13-14] and then, with further increase in temperature, silicon 

oxide is formed due to the progressive segregation of Si. The oxidation process will then 

occur through the inwards diffusion of O
2-

 through the TiO2 layer and the outwards diffusion 

of Ti
4+

 through the Si-O layer [15]. Nevertheless, due to the presence of film defects, in the 

first stage of the oxidation process, a high amount of Ti ions will be supplied in that zone 

corresponding to the oxidation occurring in the defect walls. This process will promote the 

formation of a porous Si-O layer, with low diffusion barrier performance to the out diffusion 

of Ti
4+

 ions, leading to large TiO2 crystals on the oxide scale surface. From the moment that a 

Si-O barrier layer is formed in the defect walls (see Si signal in figure 4 a)) the oxidation 

process will be controlled by the O
2-

 inward and Ti
4+

 outward ions diffusion trough the Si-O 

layer [15]. It should be remarked that this phenomenon should not influence significantly the 

global oxidation behavior of the Ti-Si-N coating (which shows the parabolic behavior 

presented in Fig. 2 a), in agreement with literature [13-15]) since, on the one hand, it only 

occurs in a few defects in the films surface (see Fig. 2 b)) and, on the other, it should be more 

intense in the first stage of the oxidation, during heating up to the 900 ºC isothermal oxidation 

temperature.

TiSiVN coating exhibited, after annealing, two-layers oxide structure with a thick 

porous inner layer and an outer discontinuous layer of well-defined crystals; the latter 

corresponded to the gray areas described above. The elemental maps shown in Fig. 5a) 

suggested that the majority of vanadium was located in the outer crystal layer, whereas inner 

layer was Ti and Si rich. This result corroborates the detection of the rutile type compound 

Ti(V)O2 indexed by XRD and Raman spectroscopy in the light gray phase in Fig. 2 [9]. 

Elemental lines shown in Fig. 5b) and 5c) showed that diffusion of V occurred exclusively 

within the oxidized volume, since a constant signal was measured for the remaining non-

oxidized coating. In general, we observed a thicker non oxidized layer in the regions covered 

by V-O crystal phase. Furthermore, comparing either the V content integrated intensities of

be concluded that V has to be diffused from the left to the right zone of this figure. Finally, it 

should be remarked that there is no indication of formation of any Si-rich layer, being Si 

signal uniformly distributed in both oxide scale and non-oxidized coating. Therefore, a dense 

compact protective silicon oxide layer localized in subsurface was not formed being Si-O 

randomly distributed in the Ti(V)O2 porous scale.

Figure 5 (continued). 

Isothermal curve of TiSiVN coating oxidized at temperatures below the melting point 

of V2O5 started with a linear increase in mass gain. This step, where a continuous Ti(V)O2 

oxide layer was grown (see Fig. 1), should be attributed to the conjugation of a fast rate of 

mass transport in the oxide with a slow surface step accompanying the gas dissociation, 

adsorption and subsequent entry of oxygen into the Ti(V)O2 lattice. In fact, at the very 

beginning of the oxidation process, due to the high Ti content, a TiO2 layer starts growing. 

The presence of V ions and its high solubility with Ti promote the formation of Ti(V)O2 solid 

solution, which comprises vanadium cations with lower oxidation states as V
3+

 ions [16-17]. 

The substitution of Ti
4+

 by V
3+

 ions in the TiO2 lattice would increase the concentration of 

interstitial metallic Ti
4+

 ions and decrease the number of excess electrons. The oxidation 

mechanism is inverted in relation to Ti-N, being the outwards diffusion of metallic ions (Ti
3+

 

Ti
n+

) more favorable that the inwards diffusion of O
2- 

ions. There are several consequences of 

this inversion: (i) the oxidation rate increases substantially, (ii) the kinetics of the oxidation is 

not controlled any more by a diffusion process but by the rate of dissociation, adsorption and 

combination at the surface of O
2-

 with metallic ions, and (iii) continuous and compact Si-rich 

layer cannot be formed. In fact, the growing of Ti(V)-O on the external part of the scale 

leaves a less compact zone in the interface between the non-oxidized material and the oxide 

scale, facilitating the local segregation of Si inside the Ti(V)-O instead its segregation for the 

interface. The elemental maps suggest that Si-O and Ti(V)O2 coexist in the inner porous 

layer, being unable to protect the material from oxidation. As a consequence, the oxidation 

process is accelerated, which is demonstrated by the initial rapid oxidation observed in the

isothermal curve. Thongtem et al. [16] studied the effect of V doping to Ti-based alloys and 

observed similar behavior with increasing V content. 

The experimental evidence shows that V2O5 crystals were formed exclusively on the 

surface. When V
3+

 or V
4+

 arrive to the surface, they are further oxidized to V
5+

 combining 

with O ions and  creating nucleation points for the V2O5 growth (see Fig. 3), which will 

expand and grow up by vanadium lateral diffusion. The process develops leading to the 

formation of the observed floret-like dispersive V2O5 phases that can comprise both ?-V2O5 

and ?-V2O5 phases as evidenced in the XRD patterns at high temperature. As soon as V2O5 

oxide expands laterally, the surface will be progressively covered by this oxide making more 

and more difficult the access of both types of ions, up to the moment that the rate of 

dissociation, adsorption and combination of O
2-

 with metallic ions is not anymore the kinetics 

controlling step but the ion diffusion through the oxide scale. Therefore, after this moment the 

isothermal curve will follow a parabolic law (see Fig. 2a)). It should be remarked that V2O5 is 

more protective than (Ti,V)O2 since the non-oxidized coating underneath it is thicker. 

 

4. Conclusion 

 

In this investigation, the effect of V additions on oxidation resistance, oxide scale 

formation and diffusion processes for TiSiVN system and their comparison to TiSiN was 

investigated. In summary, we demonstrated that oxidation of TiSiN is controlled by the 

formation of a dense and compact silicon oxide acting as a diffusion barrier, which can be 

affected by defects in the as-deposited film. The presence of V
3+

 ions in the TiO2 scale, during 

the oxidation of TiSiVN film, was responsible for an inversion in the ions diffusion process 

through the oxide scale leading to, simultaneously, a significant increase of the oxidation rate 

and the inability of formation of a Si-O protective oxide.

Abstract 

 

In the last years, vanadium rich coatings have been introduced as possible candidates 

for self-lubrication due to their optimum tribological properties. In the present investigation, 

the influence of V incorporation on the wear performance of TiSiN films deposited onto WC 

substrates by d.c. reactive magnetron sputtering is reported. The results achieved for TiSiVN 

films were compared and discussed in relation to Ti0.80Si0.15N, TiN and Ti0.82V0.15N coatings 

prepared as references. The tribological properties of the coatings were evaluated at room 

temperature on a pin on disc tribometer equipment using two different counterparts: Al2O3 

and HSS balls. The wear tracks, ball-wear scars and wear debris were characterized by 

scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). 

Tribological tests indicated that the wear rate and the friction coefficient of Ti0.80Si0.15N 

coating decreased with continuous increase of V content being the overall behaviour strongly 

dependent on the counterpart ball material. For Al2O3 balls the wear rate and friction 

coefficient of coatings were much lower compared to sliding against HSS steel balls. 

Ti0.80Si0.15N showed the lowest wear resistance among all tested coatings, independently of 

the counter-body. For V rich coatings tested with Al2O3 balls the polishing wear mechanism 

was observed, whereas adhesion wear took place when tested against HSS balls.

1. Introduction 

 

Over the past years, ternary titanium-based nitride coatings, such as TiXN (X = B, Cr, 

Al, Si, Cr, C, etc.), have been largely employed in industrial applications involving cutting 

tools, wear protection, machinery components and high temperature parts, due to their high 

hardness and suitable wear and oxidation resistance [1, 2]. However, in dry machining 

operations, the tools experience extremely harsh conditions combining abrasion, adhesion, 

oxidation, mechanical and thermal loads, which limit their lifetime. Since low friction 

coefficients can effectively reduce the contact temperatures during sliding and, consequently, 

improve the tribological behavior of tools, a lot of efforts has been carried out in the last years 

to develop self-lubricant coatings. These films should retain beneficial properties of (TiX)N 

films and offer lubricity through the formation of low-friction surface oxides. Recently, the 

attention of the scientific community has been focused on the formation of thin reaction films 

of the so-called Magnéli oxide phases based on Ti, Si, Mo, W and V, which possess easy 

shear planes [3, 4]. Among these elements, particular attention has been given to vanadium-

containing coatings which form VnO3n-1 Magnéli phases. Over the whole ternary systems the 

effect of V doping was only extensively studied for ternary CrAlN [5, 6] and TiAlN [2, 7-9] 

coatings in single layer or multilayered configurations. In all the cases a beneficial influence 

of V additions on the tribological behaviour of the coatings at room and high temperatures has 

been demonstrated. Since other ternary coating systems with superior mechanical properties 

have been successfully used as protective coatings in tribological applications, the effect of 

vanadium doping on their structure should also be considered. This is the case of TiSiN 

system, which shows similar levels of oxidation resistance as CrAlN and TiAlN films. 

Preliminary studies on the effect of V additions on the structure, mechanical properties and 

oxidation resistance of TiSiN systems have been carried out in our previous investigation 

[10]. Hence, as a way to complement that study, the aim of this work was to characterize the 

tribological behaviour at room temperature of TiSiVN sputtered coatings, sliding against 

Al2O3 and HSS balls. The influence of V addition on the TiSiN system was compared with 

the tribological results of TiN, Ti0.82V0.15N and Ti0.80Si0.15N coatings prepared and tested as a 

reference.

2. Experimental Procedure 

 

TiSiVN coatings with dissimilar Si and V contents, evaluated in our previous work 

[10], were deposited by d.c. reactive magnetron sputtering from two rectangular (100×200 

mm) magnetron cathodes working in unbalanced mode. High speed steel (AISI M2), FeCrAl 

alloy, cemented carbides, silicon and stainless steel substrates were coated for mechanical, 

structural, chemical composition and residual stress measurements. A high purity Ti (99.9%) 

target, with 10 mm diameter holes, and a high purity TiSi2 (99.9%) target were used in the 

depositions. The coatings comprise three TiSiVN coatings with different V and Si contents 

and three other coatings deposited as a reference: TiN, Ti0.82V0.15N and Ti0.80Si0.15N. V 

incorporation was achieved by filling Ti holes with 4 and 8 V pellets being the remaining 

empty holes filled with pellets of Ti. Silicon content was varied by changing the power 

density applied to each target. Ti and TiN adhesion layers of approximately 0.24 and 0.45 µm, 

respectively, were deposited below final TiSi(V)N coatings. The interlayers also contained V 

when V pellets were placed in the Ti target. A negative bias of 50 V was applied to the 

substrate holder. All the depositions were performed at a total working gas pressure of 0.3 Pa. 

The deposition time was set in order to produce coatings with approximately 2.5 µm of total 

thickness, including interlayer referred to above. A full description of the deposition 

procedure is given elsewhere [10]. Summary of the deposition parameters used for the 

coatings production and their chemical composition determined by electron probe 

microanalysis (EPMA) are shown in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. The denomination of 

the samples, as presented in tables 1 and 2, will be adopted throughout the paper in order to 

help the coatings identification and the paper reading. The subscript in Ti, Si and V letters 

represents the ratio between the at.% of each element in the coating in relation to the at.% of 

Nitrogen. 

The structure of the films was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (X’ Pert Pro MPD 

diffractometer) using a grazing incidence angle of 1
º
 with Cu K?1 radiation (? = 1.54060 Å). 

The adhesion of the films on the M2 steel substrate was evaluated by a scratch-test apparatus. 

Specimens were scratched as the normal force was increased linearly from 5 to 70 N, using a 

Rockwell C indenter with a spherical tip with a radius of 0.2 mm, a scratch speed of 10 

mm/min and a loading speed of 100 N/min. Critical loads were determined by optical 

microscope analysis according to the standard for scratch-test evaluation [11]. For each 

specimen, the indicated critical loads results from the average of 3 different scratches. The 

hardness and Young’s modulus of films were evaluated by depth-sensing indentation

technique (Micro Materials NanoTest) using a Berkovich diamond pyramid indenter. In order 

to avoid the effect of the substrate, the applied load (10 mN) was selected to keep the 

indentation depth less than 10% of the coating´s thickness. The residual stress values were 

calculated through the Stoney equation [12] by measuring the differential deflection between 

an uncoated and coated stainless steel 25 mm diameter disk. 

The tribological behaviour of the coatings was evaluated by dry-sliding tests at room 

temperature on a pin on disc tribometer. Al2O3 and HSS steel balls (both with a diameter of 6 

mm) were used as counterparts. The radius of the wear tracks was set to 5.3 and 4 mm for 

Al2O3 and HSS steel balls, respectively. All the measurements were performed with a linear 

speed of 0.10 m.s
-1

, load of 5 N, relative humidity 48±5% and 5000 cycles. The wear rate of 

the coatings was determined from the area of the wear track cross section using a 3D optical 

profilometer; an average from four different locations was used. The ball wear rates were 

evaluated from the wear cap images taken in an optical microscope. To ensure the 

reproducibility of results a set of three tests was performed under identical conditions for each 

coating. After the wear tests, the wear tracks and wear debris were characterized by scanning 

electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDS).

3. Results and discussion 

 

3.1. Structure and mechanical properties of films 

 

The X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-deposited films are shown in Figure 1. All the 

coatings presents an fcc NaCl-type structure assigned to crystalline TiN phase, but different 

peaks position and intensities can be perceived. All films presented well defined peaks except 

for the coating with higher silicon content (Ti0.52Si0.20V0.14N) for which a strong decrease of 

the peaks intensity as well a significant broadening was observed. This result suggests a 

decrease of the crystallinity and grain size, in good accordance with literature where for TiSiN 

films with high Si contents amorphization of the structure is usually observed [13]. A closer 

analysis of the peaks positions indicated that in all cases a fcc solid solution should be 

expected. In fact, starting with the individual addition of V and Si to TiN, the peaks are 

shifted to higher angles, behaviour associated to a smaller unit cell (insert in Figure 1). Taking 

into account that the residual stresses are very similar among these coatings (see table 3), such 

a result can only be explained by the presence of V or Si in substitutional solid solution, due 

to their smaller radius (0.143 and 0.117 nm, respectively) in comparison with Ti (0.147 nm). 

When both Si and V are added to TiN, a synergetic effect of both elements are observed being 

the diffraction peaks shifted to further higher diffraction angles. A detailed description of the 

effect of Si and V additions on the structure of TiN is shown in our previous work [10].

Figure 1 - Typical X-ray diffraction patterns of the dissimilar coatings. 

Table 3 shows the hardness, Young´s Modulus, residual stress and scratch test critical 

load values of the coatings. V incorporation at the TiN and TiSiN systems slightly increased 

the hardness and Young’s modulus value of coatings. Ti0.52Si0.20V0.14N coating exhibited the 

lowest hardness and Young´s modulus as compared to the other films, a consequence of the 

above referred loss of crystallinity. Residual stresses were similar for all coatings 

(compressive; 3 – 4 GPa) suggesting that the shift of TiN peaks to higher angles should be 

exclusively attributed to the presence of V and/or Si in solid solution. Moreover, by similar 

reasons, the small enhancement in the hardness achieved with V additions is probably due to 

solid solution hardening. Similar correlations could be drawn for TiSiN system in comparison 

to TiN coating. In relation to the adhesion of films only two failure modes were observed on 

the scratch tracks of the coatings: the first cracking (Lc1) and the first chipping (Lc2). Globally, 

all the coatings are well adherent to the substrate exhibiting high Lc values with Ti0.82V0.15N 

and Ti0.52Si0.20V0.14N being better and worse performing, respectively. In general, Si 

incorporation in TiN system globally decreased the critical load values of the coatings.

3.2 Tribological behaviour 

 

3.2.1 The wear rate of coatings and balls 

 

The wear rate of coatings tested at room temperature were dependent on the 

counterpart material, as shown in Figure 2. Generally, when Al2O3 balls were used as 

counterparts, the wear rate of coatings was much lower compared to sliding against HSS steel 

balls. For reference coatings tested with Al2O3 balls, the tribological behaviour of TiN coating 

was improved when vanadium was added; on the other hand, the addition of Si had a negative 

effect. As it will be shown later, there is a correlation between the wear rates and the cracking 

critical load values of these coatings, which suggests a possible relationship with the fracture 

toughness of the coatings and its influence on the wear debris production.  

When Si and V were added simultaneously, V had predominant influence. In fact, any 

of the TiSiVN coatings showed lower wear rate than the TiN reference, with similar values to 

Ti0.82V0.15N sample. It should be remarked that these coatings have, generally, similar Lc 

values as Ti0.82V0.15N, i.e. higher Lc than the ones measured for Ti0.80Si0.15N . A similar trend 

has been observed for other nitride coating systems containing V [7, 14]. Besides the 

influence of V on the Lc values, the high wear resistance of V-rich coatings can also be 

attributed to the formation of V lubricious oxides on the wear track of coatings (see further 

discussion below). This can explain why Ti0.52Si0.20V0.14N shows lower wear rate than TiN 

(and Ti0.80Si0.15N) in spite of its lower Lc value.  

The wear rate of the coatings increased significantly when tested against HSS balls, 

particularly for the coatings where the V-rich lubricious oxide was identified during the 

contact with Al2O3 balls. The lower hardness of HSS ball associated with an easier 

incrustation of hard wear debris in the sliding contact promoted abrasion of the wear track 



Annex I 

196 
Filipe Daniel Fernandes 

with increasing wear rates. Limited formation of vanadium oxides led to higher friction 

coefficient, more energy dissipated and more oxide particles in the wear track, as it will be 

discussed below. 

As expected, the wear rate of the Al2O3 balls is much lower than that of softer HSS 

balls. Different trends were found between the wear rates of the coatings and the balls: (i) 

HSS ball wear rate increased when the coating wear decreased, and (ii) the wear rate of the 

Al2O3 balls was very low and almost constant for all the tests. In both cases, the ball surfaces 

were covered with the wear debris; however, HSS balls show large areas with shallow 

scratches parallel to the movement of the ball and higher amount of adhered material.

3.2.2 Friction coefficient 

 

Figure 3 a) and b) shows the friction coefficient of the coatings tested against Al2O3 

and HSS balls, respectively. As the radius of the wear tracks used for Al2O3 and HSS balls 

tests were not the same and consequently, the sliding distances were different, the evolution 

of the friction coefficient is plotted as a function of the total number of cycles (5000 cycles). 

All friction curves exhibited two stages: running-in and steady state. Generally, the coatings 

showed lower friction coefficient values against Al2O3 showing thus similar trend to the wear 

rate. The highest friction coefficient was obtained for Ti0.80Si0.15N coating with values of 1.09 

and 1.15 when tested against Al2O3 and HSS balls, respectively; it should be pointed out that 

the wear rate was the highest as well. TiN coating presented also a high friction coefficient 

when tested against Al2O3 ball, with a large variation in the values with the number of cycles. 

Addition of Si and V had a significant impact on the frictional properties when Al2O3 

ball was used as a counterpart. Compared to Ti0.80Si0.15N, the friction dropped to one half 

when sufficient amount of vanadium was added and silicon content was kept low; the friction 

of Ti0.65Si0.11V0.15N is below 0.5 being the lowest together with Ti0.82V0.15N coating. Testing 

with HSS balls showed only limited influence of coating composition on the friction 

coefficient. Again TiSiVN coatings exhibited the lowest friction, although it was only about 

10% lower than that of Ti0.80Si0.15N and similar to that of TiN.

3.2.3 Wear mechanisms: Sliding against Al2O3 balls 

 

The changes in the friction coefficient and wear rates can be only partially correlated 

with the structural and mechanical properties of the films. To identify the dominant wear 

mechanisms scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-

EDS) was used to analyze the worn surfaces and the wear debris produced in the contact. 

Typical 2D profiles of the wear tracks of the coatings tested against Al2O3 are depicted in 

Figure 4 a). Profilometer measurements showed that with the addition of V to TiN and 

Ti0.80Si0.15N coatings the wear track became shallower. Ti0.80Si0.15N and TiN showed the 

deepest and widest wear tracks among all the coatings, which gave rise to their highest wear 

rates shown in Figure 2. The wear track of TiN coating was covered by fine scratches parallel 

to the relative sliding movement suggesting abrasion as the dominant wear mechanism. The 

scratches ended by the accumulation of the dragged material, which can well explain the 

fluctuations observed in the friction curve (Figure 5)). EDS analysis performed in the wear 

track revealed a mixture of as-deposited and oxidized coating material. Ti0.80Si0.15N coating 

showed a similar wear mechanism as TiN; however, due to lower fracture toughness the worn 

particles were larger and scratches deeper. The presence of large non-oxidized particles 

originated from the coating led to an intensive abrasion of TiN and, particularly, Ti0.80Si0.15N 

coating.

wear debris with vermicular morphology distributed throughout the wear surface. EDS 

analysis performed at these well adhered wear debris particles showed that they are mainly 

composed of V and O with traces of Ti and Si, suggesting the presence of V-O, Ti-O and Si-O

oxide phases. It should be remarked that all the other zones of the wear track showed EDS 

spectra identical to the as deposited films. After the test with Ti0.52Si0.20V0.14N coating, the 

wear scar of the Al2O3 ball was covered with wear debris forming a transfer layer identified 

by EDS analysis as a mixture of V-O, Ti-O and Si-O oxides. Friction induced oxidation of 

wearing surfaces containing vanadium leading to formation of V-O, which acts as a solid 

lubricant in sliding contact [2, 7, 8]. In this study, thick tribolayer consisting mostly of 

vanadium oxide was indeed formed on the surface of Ti0.82V0.15N coating. However, addition 

of silicon had detrimental effect on tribolayer formation and function during the sliding 

process. It seems that Si somehow limits the formation of thick well-distributed tribolayer. 

The higher wear rate and friction coefficient of Ti0.75Si0.11V0.03N in relation to 

Ti0.65Si0.11V0.15N coating was in good accordance to the lower amount of “vermicular” debris 

detected in the wear tracks. Although Ti0.82V0.15N and Ti0.65Si0.11V0.15N showed similar V 

contents, the higher amount of transfer layer was formed in the case of Ti0.82V0.15N. The role 

of Si is not clear, although it is possible that Si-O top layer hinders ion diffusion [15] and thus 

protects the coating from oxidation required to form sufficient amount of lubricious vanadium 

oxide.  

The worn surface of Ti0.52Si0.20V0.14N film was found to be covered by fish-scale-like 

agglomerates along the worn surface indicating severe shear deformation of the tribofilm 

during the sliding test [8]. EDS analysis suggested the presence of V-O, Si-O and Ti-O oxides 

in this zone. Additionally, EDS analysis showed significantly stronger peak of Si in relation to 

the one found for the other TiSiVN films. Therefore, the oxide layer is dominated by Si-O. 

Due to low fracture toughness large wear debris particles are detached during the running-in 

stage; these particles are then either removed from the sliding contact (they were found on the 

side of the wear track) or oxidized forming adhered oxide layer both on coating and ball 

surface. However, due to the strong shear force that the ball imposes to the coating, and the 

more brittle nature of Si-O-rich oxide layer, a stick-slip adhesion process will take place, 

deforming and breakage the wear debris and giving rise to the above referred fish-like aspect. 

Therefore, the tribological efficiency will be lower in this coating in relation to the other V-

containing films due to the combined effect of: i) lower fracture toughness, ii) less lubricious 

V-O phase formed due the high Si content and iii) stick-slip adhesion wear mechanism.

3.2.4 Wear mechanisms: Sliding against HSS balls 

 

Low hardness of HSS balls compared to Al2O3 resulted in high ball wear and wide 

wear tracks (see Figure 4 b)). In fact, one might expect that hard coatings will resist much 

more to sliding against relatively soft steel ball, whereas Al2O3 counterpart should induce 

severe wear damage. However, Figure 2 and Figure 4 clearly indicate opposite behavior, i.e. 

higher wear with HSS balls. 

Reference TiN and Ti0.80Si0.15N coatings exhibited slightly different wear track 

appearance. Figure 7 shows the typical morphology of the worn surfaces of these coatings and 

the corresponding wear scars of the balls. EDS analysis performed on the transfer layer of 

TiN coating, which was preferential formed in the central part of the wear track, evidenced 

material transfer from the ball to the coating surface. The transfer layer thus consisted of 

titanium and iron oxides. However, no oxygen was detected by EDS outside of the center part 

of unworn coating. Although the wear scars of the counterparts were covered with as-

deposited and oxidized material from the coating for both TiN and Ti0.80Si0.15N coatings, the 

latter exhibited higher material transfer to the HSS ball and, particularly, larger wear debris 

particles. Hard non-oxidized particles embedded into compact adhered tribolayer act as sharp 

cutting edges causing abrasive damage and accelerating wear. On the other hand, relatively 

thick and well-adhered layer on the ball wear scar protected ball material from further 

damage; thicker layer built during sliding against on Ti0.80Si0.15N resulted in lower ball wear 

(Figure 2 b)). It is clear here that higher amount of non-oxidized debris adhered on the ball 

protects the ball itself but produces higher wear of the coating; the absence of well-developed 

oxide layer on the coating surface is detrimental decreasing coating wear resistance.

HSS balls tested against: c) TiN coating, d) Ti0.80Si0.15N coating. 

Absence of continuous tribolayer in the wear track was observed as well for the 

coatings containing vanadium. Typical worn surfaces of the coatings (Ti0.82V0.15N and 

Ti0.65Si0.11V0.15N) shown in Figure 8 were covered by stripes of adhered material, which 

covered only small part of the wear tracks, see Figures 8 a) and b), indicating that the wear is 

driven by a combination of adhesion and polishing wear. EDS analysis revealed that the 

stripes were composed of fully oxidized (i.e. no nitrogen observed) coating elements mixed

with iron originating from the ball. Outside of the stripes no oxygen was identified by EDS. 

The phenomenon of adhesive wear behaviour was believed to be a result of hard film and 

relatively soft bearing ball [16]. Nevertheless, some of the V-O oxide present on the stripe 

zones should still provide a lubricious effect since a decrease of the wear rate with V 

incorporation is observed. This behaviour is enhanced in case of Ti0.52Si0.20V0.14N coating 

where an even higher wear rate is observed; its lower fracture toughness, due to the higher 

silicon content, constrains the V-O phase formation decreasing even more its content on the 

wear track. Ti0.82V0.15N film displayed the lowest wear rate of all the coatings due to the 

higher amount of V-O oxide formed at the surface.  

In summary, we demonstrated that V additions successfully reduced the wear rate and 

friction coefficient of TiSiN system; moreover we also showed that the tribological behaviour 

of films is strongly dependent on the counterpart material due to the presence of dissimilar 

wear mechanisms.

4. Conclusion 

 

The results showed that alloying TiSiN system with increasing V content improves the 

resistance to wear and decreases the friction coefficient; however, the tribological behaviour 

is strongly dependent of the counterbody ball material. SEM and Raman analysis revealed 

that the influence of V was due to the formation of V-O lubricious oxide on the contact zone. 

When Al2O3 balls were used in the tests, the wear was driven by polishing wear and oxides 

containing V-O are spread all over the wear track. On the other hand, when tested against 

HSS balls, adhesion wear took place with material transfer from the ball to specific zones of 

the wear track, being the lubricious effect of V-O significantly reduced. Ti0.80Si0.15N film 

displayed the lowest wear resistance among all the tested coatings due to its lower fracture 

toughness which promotes the formation of bigger wear debris acting as strong abrasion 

players.
