ABSTRACT: The Porangatu Granulite Complex is exposed in 
the central part of the Neoproterozoic Tocantins province in cen-
tral Brazil, along the boundary between the Brasília Belt to the east 
and the Araguaia Belt to the west. This is part of the transconti-
nental Transbrasiliano-Kandi shear system. The complex includes 
garnet-rich enderbite and charnockite, high-grade gneisses as well 
as lenses of garnet-bearing mafic granulite or amphibolites, and in 
situ anatectic charnockite, elongated in the NNE-SSW direction 
along the Talismã Shear Zone (TSZ). These rocks represent suites 
of ortho-derived rocks of calc-alkaline affinity and small contribu-
tions of tholeiitic basalts and aluminous paragneisses. The structural 
framework records thrust components probably related to the early 
stages of an oblique collision during the evolution of Neoprotero-
zoic Brasiliano orogens, and can be understood as involving a colli-
sional system of two crustal blocks, initially with thrust components 
which in its final stage evolved to a transcurrent system with dextral 
movement. This led to intense imbrication, generation of mylonit-
ic foliation, stretching lineation, tectonic banding and rotation of 
structures and minerals. The heterogeneous and progressive ductile 
deformation was accompanied by metamorphic re-equilibrium in 
late Neoproterozoic time. Granulite facies conditions reached a met-
amorphic maximum at temperature and pressure above 850°C and 
10 kbar, in an almost anhydrous environment, with or without ana-
texis. Zircon U-Pb SHRIMP analyses for two selected rock samples 
indicated the combined age of 580 ± 7 Ma for a charnockite and 
548 ± 48 Ma for a mafic granulite from which the charnockite is 
throught to have been derived. The mafic granulite contains zircon 
grains of ca. 2.1 Ga, indicating Paleoproterozoic igneous protoliths 
involved in Neoproterozoic high-grade metamorphism. In addi-
tion, older inherited zircon grains of ca. 3.1 and 2.0 Ga (207Pb/206Pb 

RESUMO: O Complexo Granulítico Porangatu está exposto na porção 
central da Província Tocantins, do Neoproterozoico, no centro do Brasil, 
ao longo da fronteira entre o Cinturão Brasília, a leste, e o Cinturão Ara-
guaia, a oeste. Esta região faz parte do sistema de cisalhamento transconti-
nental Transbrasiliano-Kandi. O complexo inclui enderbitos e charnocki-
tos ricos em granada, gnaisses de alto grau metamórfico, bem como lentes 
de granada granulitos máficos ou granada anfibolitos, e charnockitos ana-
téticos in situ, o qual forma corpos alongados na direção NNE-SSW, ao 
longo da Zona de Cisalhamento Talismã (ZCT). Esse conjunto de rochas 
representam suítes de rochas ortoderivadas de afinidade cálcio-alcalina e 
pequenas contribuições de basaltos tholeíticos e paragnaisses aluminosos. 
O quadro estrutural registra componentes de cavalgamento relacionados 
provavelmente com os estágios iniciais de uma colisão oblíqua durante 
a evolução dos orógenos Brasilianos do Neoproterozoico e pode ser com-
preendido como envolvendo um sistema colisional de dois blocos crustais, 
inicialmente com componentes de cavalgamento que evoluiu em sua fase 
final para um sistema transcorrente com cinemática dextral. Isso levou à 
intensa imbricação, geração de foliação milonítica, lineação de estiramen-
to, bandamento tectônico e rotação de estruturas e minerais. A deformação 
dúctil heterogênea e progressiva foi acompanhada por reequilíbrio meta-
mórfico no Neoproterozoico tardio, que atingiu condições metamórficas 
máximas na fácies granulito a temperatura e pressão acima de 850ºC e 
10  kbar, respectivamente, em ambiente quase anidro, atingindo a ana-
texia. As análises U-Pb SHRIMP em zircão realizadas em duas amostras 
de rochas selecionadas indicaram idade combinada de 580 ± 7 Ma para 
um charnockito e 548 ± 48 Ma para um granulito máfico do qual o char-
nockito foi derivado. O granulito máfico contém cristais de zircão datados 
de 2,1 Ga, indicando protólito ígneo do Paleoproterozoico envolvidos no

INTRODUCTION

The Porangatu Granulite Complex (Gorayeb 1996a) is 
exposed in the central part of the Tocantins Province, a large 
Neoproterozoic orogenic area in central Brazil formed during 
the collision between the Amazonian and São Francisco-Congo 
cratons. The province is formed by three main belts: the Brasília 
Belt, in the eastern half of the province; the Araguaia Belt, 
along the eastern margin of the Amazonian Craton; and the 
Paraguay Belt, in the southwestern part of the province (Fig. 1). 
Granulitic rocks are exposed in several areas of the Brasília Belt 
(Dardenne 2000) and have been the object of recent mapping 
and geochronological studies (Dantas et al. 2007).

The Porangatu granulite belt is exposed in an area of 
approximately 80 x 25 km, extending in a NNE-SSW direc-
tion between the westernmost exposures of the Paraguay 
Belt, the Goiás magmatic arc, the Brasília Belt and the 
metasedimentary rocks of the Araguaia Belt to the north, 
which forms a larger geotectonic unit (Tocantins orogen) 
and could represent the roots of this Neoproterozoic orogen. 
The granulitic rocks appear as lens-shaped bodies along the 
10 km-wide Talismã Shear Zone (TSZ), comprising mainly 
high-grade mylonitic gneisses. This is part of the transconti-
nental transcurrent dextral shear zone system, known as the 
Transbrasiliano Lineament (TBL), which crosses much of 
the South American continent (Schobbenhaus Filho et al. 
1975, Cordani et al. 2013). The mega-shear zone is exposed 
from Argentina and Paraguay, through central Brazil, and 
may be traced through northeastern Brazil into western 
Africa, where it is known as the Kandi Lineament. The total 
length of the lineament is estimated to be approximately 
4,000 km, making it the most extensive shear zone on Earth 
(Schobbenhaus Filho et al. 1975, Trompette 1994, Oliveira 
&amp;amp; Mohiak 2003, Arthaud et al. 2008, Attoh &amp;amp; Brown 2008, 
Santos et al. 2008b, Cordani et al. 2013, Cacama et al. 2015).

The main objective of the present study, based on the 
petrographic, structural and geochronological characteristics 
of high-grade metamorphic rocks, is to enhance understand-
ing of the evolution of this granulite belt and of its signifi-
cance in the development of the TBL, as well as in the tectonic 
evolution of the Araguaia and Brasília belts. Although other 
granulite complexes in central Brazil have been investigated in 
some detail — for example the Anápolis-Itauçu and the Uruaçu 
complexes (Fischel et al. 1998) —, the high-grade metamor-
phic rocks of Porangatu remain poorly known. Therefore, the 
main focus of the present study is to investigate their field, 
structural and petrographic characteristics, as well as their age.

GEOLOGICAL CONTEXT

In the eastern part of the Tocantins Province (Fig. 1), 
the Brasília Belt includes:
1. several metasedimentar y units deposited on a 

Paleoproterozoic sialic basement (Almeida et al. 1981, 
Fuck et al. 1993, Pimentel et al. 2000, 2011);

2. one small allochthonous sialic fragment made dominantly 
of Archean trondhjemite-tonalite-granodiorite (TTG) 
terranes and greenstone belts (the Goiás Archean block 
of Jost et al. 2013);

3. three large mafic-ultramafic complexes (Barro Alto, 
Niquelândia and Cana Brava; Ferreira Filho et al. 2010);

4. the Neoproterozoic Goiás Magmatic Arc in the west (for a 
brief review see Laux et al. 2005, Brito-Neves et al. 2014);

5. a large Neoproterozoic high-grade terrain known as 
the Anápolis-Itauçu complex, interpreted as the roots of the 
Brasília orogen (Piuzana et al. 2003, Giustina et al. 2011).

The Araguaia Belt forms the central and northern parts of 
the Tocantins Province, representing a N-S collisional orogen 

ages) in charnockite also confirm the existence of older Archaean 
and Paleoproterozoic material in this region, possibly derived from 
the Goiás Massif. A 0.88 Ga inherited zircon grain is suggestive of 
derivation from the Goiás Magmatic Arc. This Neoproterozoic age 
for the high-grade metamorphism is substantially younger than 
those reported for other granulites in the Brasília Belt (ca. 0.65 Ga), 
suggesting that the Porangatu Granulite Complex is more probably 
associated with the evolution of the younger Araguaia Belt. The new 
field, structural, petrographic and geochronological data suggest that 
the Porangatu Granulite Complex was involved in a high-tempera-
ture ductile strike-slip shear zone juxtaposing terrains of different 
ages (Archaean, Paleoproterozoic, Neoproterozoic), crustal nature 
and level (lower and middle continental crust), strongly reworked 
during the final stages of the Brasiliano orogeny, and represents the 
exposed roots of the Tocantins orogen.

charnockito também confirma a existência de material Arqueano e Pa-
leoproterozoico nesta região, possivelmente derivado do Maciço de Goiás. 
Um grão de zircão herdado de 0,88 Ga é sugestivo de derivação do Arco 
Magmático de Goiás. Essa idade neoproterozoica para o metamorfismo 
de alto grau é substancialmente mais jovem do que a relatada para outros 
granulitos do Cinturão Brasília (cerca de 0,65 Ga), sugerindo que o Com-
plexo Granulítico Porangatu está mais provavelmente associado à evolução 
do Cinturão Araguaia mais jovem. Os novos dados de campo, estruturais, 
petrográficos, e geocronológicos, sugerem que o Complexo Granulítico Po-
rangatu foi envolvido em uma expressiva zona de cisalhamento transcor-
rente dúctil estabelecida em alta temperatura, que justapôs unidades de ro-
chas de diferentes idades (Arqueano, Paleoproterozoico, Neoproterozoico), 
naturezas e níveis crustais (crosta continental inferior e média) fortemente 
retrabalhadas nos estágios finais da orogenia Brasiliano e representam as 
raízes expostas do Orógeno Tocantins.

Granulite-facies metamorphism at ca. 570-580 Ma in the Porangatu Complex



extending for more than 1,200 km, 150 - 200 km in width. 
It consists dominantly of metasedimentary units, associated with 
ophiolite, exposed along the eastern margin of the Amazonian 
Craton (Alvarenga et al. 2000, Moura et al. 2008, Gorayeb 
et al. 2008). The orogen started its evolution at ca. 870 Ma 
with the deposition of the Araguaia basin and the formation 
of the ophiolitic suites represented by Morro do Agostinho, 
Quatipuru and Serra do Tapa suites (Kotschoubey et al. 2005, 
Paixão et al. 2008, Miyagawa &amp;amp; Gorayeb 2013, Paixão &amp;amp; 
Gorayeb 2014, Barros 2015). The main orogenic phase took 
place at ca. 550 Ma, with tectonic transportation towards the 
Amazonian Craton, accompanied by a metamorphism that 

increases gradually from anchimetamorphism, in the west, to 
middle-amphibolite facies, in the east, with emplacement of 
syn- to late-orogenic granites (Alvarenga et al. 2000).

The Paraguay Belt is a fold-and-thrust belt established 
along the southern margin of the Amazonian Craton and to 
the east of the Rio Apa cratonic block. It forms a 1,000 km 
long curved orogen convex toward the cratonic areas. It shows 
polyphase deformation with large-scale linear synforms and 
antiforms, as well as reverses and thrust faults. Magmatic 
rocks are very scarce and represented mostly by post-oro-
genic K-rich granite intrusions (Almeida 1984, Alvarenga 
et al. 2000, McGee et al. 2012). The belt comprises distinct 

faults

structural zones: a sedimentary platform cover, an unmet-
amorphosed folded external zone, a metamorphic (green-
schist facies) internal zone, and granite plutons (Alvarenga 
&amp;amp; Trompette 1993). Ediacaran fauna found in rocks of the 
external zone of the southern part of the belt, as well as U-Pb 
SHRIMP data in zircon grains of volcanic tuffs, indicate a 
depositional age of ca. 543 Ma (Boggiani et al. 2010).

The Goiás Magmatic Arc, in the western part of the 
Brasília Belt, comprises calc-alkaline volcano-sedimentary 
sequences associated with plutonic counterparts, represented 
mainly by tonalite and granodiorite. The arc was initiated 
at ca. 900 Ma with the growth of intra-oceanic island arcs, 
comprising meta-basalt, meta-andesite, meta-dacite and 
meta-rhyolite, as well as the corresponding plutonic rocks. 
These rocks display primitive geochemical and isotopic char-
acteristics with initial ?Nd values mostly ranging between +6 
and +3, and Nd TDM ages between 0.8 and 1.1 Ga (Pimentel 
et al. 1991, 1997, 2000; Pimentel &amp;amp; Fuck 1992, Laux 2004, 
Laux et al. 2005). Trace element and isotopic data suggest 
that some of the tonalites are similar to Phanerozoic adakites 
(Pimentel et al. 1991, 1997). Arc magmatism was two pulses 
at ca. 900-800 Ma and ca. 640 Ma, and the younger rocks 
tend to be more evolved geochemically and isotopically, pre-
senting evidence of reworking of older sialic crust. The main 
metamorphic event took place at ca. 630 Ma, as indicated by 
U-Pb titanite data and Sm-Nd garnet ages (Laux et al. 2005). 
This is similar to the regional metamorphic event observed 
in several other parts of the Brasília Belt, and has been inter-
preted as representative of the final closure of the ocean and 
continental collision (for a review see Cordani et al. 2013).

The TBL is part of the transcontinental transcurrent dex-
tral shear zones that extends across a large part of the South 
American continent with records in Argentina and Paraguay, 
across central to northwestern Brazil in the Atlantic coastal 
area of Ceará. In the central portion of Brazil, the lineament 
is represented by extensive shear zones and its ramifications, 
with dextral movement, consisting of mylonite affecting proto-
liths of different nature, origin and age, such as the Tocantins 
Shear Belt (Gorayeb 1996a, 1996b, Gorayeb et al. 2000) and 
the TSZ (Gorayeb 1996a, Dantas et al. 2007). The TBL and 
its extension in West Africa were first recognized by Kroener 
&amp;amp; Cordani (2003), Caby (2003) and Cordani et al. (2013).

Several grabens associated with fault systems are identified. 
They were reactivated from latest Palaeozoic to Quaternary 
times. The studies of Oliveira &amp;amp; Mohiak (2003) and Santos 
et al. (2013) demonstrate that the TBL influenced the forma-
tion and deposition of the Palaeozoic-Mesozoic Parnaiba Basin.

The Kandi Lineament in Africa (Cordani et al. 2013, Caby 
2003, Kroener &amp;amp; Cordani 2003) is an extension of the Sobral-
Pedro II Lineament (Gama Junior et al. 1988, Gorayeb and 
Abreu 1998, Cavalcante et al. 2003, Gorayeb &amp;amp; Lima 2014).

In the northwest of the Borborema Province, the 
Neoproterozoic evolution started with an early collision 
associated with the closure of the Pharusian-Goiás ocean 
at 620–600 Ma and generalized crustal thickening, marked 
by the development of high-grade metamorphic rocks and 
high-T thrusting foliation, defining a West Gondwana oro-
gen. This was subsequently reactivated by a set of transcur-
rent dextral shear zones, forming the Transbrasiliano-Kandi 
strike-slip belt, which acted as a transform plate boundary, 
allowing the closure of the ocean and collision with the 
São Francisco Craton at ca. 590 Ma. Interactions between 
the two collisions between 590 and 570 Ma and continu-
ous cratonic indentation led to the province-wide switch to 
transcurrent system and block escape, generally to the NE, 
associated with wide magmatism and regional rotation of 
the maximum shortening axis (Araujo et al. 2014). This sit-
uation is similar to that of the Tocantins Province, which 
extends under the Parnaiba Basin.

RESULTS

Geology and tectonics 
of the Porangatu-Alvorada region

In the Porangatu-Alvorada region, high-grade meta-
morphic rocks may be grouped into two main litho-struc-
tural units:
1. the Gneissic-supracrustal terrain and
2. the Porangatu Granulite Complex within the TSZ, just 

to the west of the Serra Azul Granitoid (Fig. 2).

The initial cartographic studies were carried out by the 
Brazilian Geological Survey (CPRM) through the Porangatu 
Project (Machado et al. 1981), where the main lithostrati-
graphic units of the region were delimited and defined, 
followed by the cartographic and petrographic studies of 
Gorayeb (1996a), and the mapping in more detail executed 
by Dantas et al. (2007).

The gneissic-supracrustal terrain occupies a large area 
east of the Serra Azul-Cajueiro-Talismã Lineament, which 
represents the boundary between two crustal terranes within 
the ductile shear zone; according to the Sm-Nd isotopic data 
reported by Dantas et al. (2006), it belongs to the Goiás 
Magmatic Arc. It comprises mainly migmatized orthogneisses 
of tonalitic, quartz dioritic and granitic composition, as well 
as paragneisses, micaschists bearing biotite, garnet and stau-
rolite, amphibolites, calc-silicate rocks, quartzites, banded 
iron rock (BIF) and meta-ultramafic rocks.

The Porangatu Granulite Complex is exposed to the 
west of the Serra Azul-Cajueiro Lineament, within the TSZ,

and forms an 80 x 25 km elongated complex in the N25°E 
direction (Fig. 2). The rock units form lens-shaped bodies 
and the main rock types are garnet-rich enderbitic, char-
no-enderbitic and charnockitic granulite, and less abundant 
garnet mafic granulite and biotite-garnet mylonitic gneiss. 
Amphibolite and mafic granulite form large lenses such as 
the Bocaina and Barreirinho Vermelho amphibolites, as well 
as small dismembered boudins mixed with mylonitic ortho- 
and paragneisses. These rocks represent a suite of ortho-de-
rived rocks of calc-alkaline affinity and small contributions 
of tholeiitic basalts and rare garnet paragneisses. Another 
type of charnockite forms small (cm to m) irregular bodies 
of leucosome as veins or patchy migmatitic structures within 
the enderbitic and mafic granulites, and represents in situ 
anatexis during high-grade metamorphism.

The Talismã Shear Zone (TSZ) extends for at least 25 km 
in the N20-30°E direction, representing a zone of strong tec-
tonic mobility juxtaposing terrains of different ages and crustal 
levels (lower and middle continental crust). In the southern 
part of the area, the Archean Serra Azul Granitoid (Dantas 
et al. 2006, 2007) forms a large lens representing a crustal slice 
tectonically interleaved with other TSZ rock units. Similarly, 
several smaller and elongated syn-tectonic granites are known, 
such as the Pau Seco Granitoid Suite (Fig. 2, 3A, B).

The main structural features are the mylonitic foliation 
and tectonic transposition banding, as well as the strong 
stretching lineation. Noteworthy is the strong linearity of 
the structural features displayed by the rocks, which were 
transformed into L- and L-S tectonites (Fig. 3C). The folia-
tions generally have NNE-SSW trends with high dips, pre-
dominantly to the SE. The stretch lineation has low dip, 
around 0° to 21° to the NE (predominantly) or SW quad-
rants (Fig. 2). The tectonic kinematic indicators, developed 
in high-temperature gneiss tectonites, are defined by the 
stretching, flattening and rotation of sigmoidal porphyroclasts 
of feldspars, pyroxene and garnet, and pressure shadows in 
asymmetric patterns (Fig. 3); anastomosing mylonitic foli-
ation with S-C foliation, and intrafolial folds in Z-patterns.

In addition, inflections of foliation and dragfolds identified 
at the macroscale were caused by the curving of supracrustal 
rock structures near the TSZ, such as Serra Verde to NW of 
Porangatu (Fig. 2). All these features reaffirm the evolution 
of a continental transcurrent shear system with dextral kine-
matics in this region, similar to that recognized in the Porto 
Nacional High-Grade Metamorphic Complex to the north 
(Gorayeb 1996b, Gorayeb et al. 2000), in the Cariré Granulite 
Belt (Gorayeb &amp;amp; Abreu 1989) and the Macaco Granulite body 
(Gorayeb &amp;amp; Abreu 1998), northwest of Borborema Province.

The heterogeneous and progressive ductile deformation was 
accompanied by re-equilibrium in metamorphic conditions 
of upper-amphibolite or granulite facies. This led to intense 

imbrication, generation of mylonitic foliation, stretch lineation, 
tectonic banding and rotation of structures and minerals (Fig. 3).

The gneiss-migmatite-supracrustal domain, east of the 
Serra Azul-Cajueiro Lineament presents very different struc-
tural behavior, in which the foliation shows approximately 
N-S direction with low to medium dip (8-35°) to ESE and 
WSW. The complex structural pattern is due to folding and 
drags, and to the rotation of these structures in the vicini-
ties of the TSZ (Fig. 2). This structural framework records 
thrust components probably related to the early stages of 
an oblique collision during the evolution of Neoproterozoic 
Brasiliano orogens in this portion of the Tocantins Province. 
Thus, the tectonic evolution of the region can be understood 
as involving a collisional system of two crustal blocks, ini-
tially with thrust components which in its final stage evolved 
to a transcurrent system with dextral movement.

Petrography and metamorphism 
of the granulitic rocks

Enderbitic and charnoenderbitic (leucoenderbites) gran-
ulite are the most abundant rock types in the Porangatu 
Complex. They are generally homogeneous, with only a 
very weak banding, except for some local shear zones where 
mylonitic textures are recognized. They are normally fine-
grained rocks, greenish to gray, and locally with brownish 
to red spots due to the presence of garnet (Fig. 4A, 4B, 5A, 
5B). They normally contain decimetric to metric enclaves 
of mafic granulites and are composed of plagioclase, alka-
li-feldspar, quartz, orthopyroxene and garnet and minor 
biotite, zircon, apatite and opaque minerals.

In the enderbites and charnoenderbites, oligoclase-an-
desine (An28-39) shows antipertitic intergrowth and albite 
or albite-pericline twinning, although, in many cases twin-
ning has been erased by deformation. Antipertitic texture 
is formed by small lamellae of alkali feldspar and parallel 
bands or rectangular patches, following the plagioclase cleav-
age. Myrmekitic textures occur along the contacts between 
plagioclase and alkali feldspar, and become more common 
in deformed zones. Alkali feldspar is a minor constituent, 
ranging in abundance from 0 (enderbites) to 30% modal 
(charnoenderbites). Twinning is faint or absent and they 
present perthitic texture (mesoperthite). Quartz is abun-
dant and exhibits strong undulose extinction in larger crys-
tals or polygonal recrystallized aggregates. Orthopyroxene is 
less deformed and frequently constitutes relict crystals, par-
tially altered to green or brown biotite. Clinopyroxene is rare 
and is partially altered to light green amphibole. Garnet is 
abundant (5 to 15% modal) and occurs as porphyroblasts 
and poikiloblastic crystals with irregular contacts and pla-
gioclase, quartz, apatite and biotite inclusions; idioblastic 
hexagonal crystals are not as common. Biotite is commonly

present and in general defines a weak foliation. Two gen-
erations of biotite are recognized: one is primary with red-
dish-brown strong pleochroism, and the other is secondary, 

after orthopyroxene, presenting weak pleochroism. The first 
generation represents crystals which are stable at the gran-
ulite facies and the second is a retrograde mineral phase.

Charnockite forms small (cm to m) irregular bodies or 
leucosome veins within the enderbitic and mafic granulites; 
they are coarse-grained, highly leucocratic, isotropic and pres-
ent greenish-gray colour, sometimes with a bluish tint given 
by blue quartz (Fig. 6A, 6B). The mesoperthite alkali feldspar 
forms relatively large crystals (up to 3 cm) with rounded inclu-
sions of quartz with string and patch perthitic intergrowth. 
The plagioclase is antiperthitic oligoclase-andesine (An24-35), 
present albite and pericline twinning. Orthopyroxene is rare 
and mostly altered to amphibole and biotite.

Mafic granulite is the least abundant rock type in the 
Porangatu complex and in some cases occurs as enclaves in 
enderbite and charnoenderbite. It is fine-grained, equigran-
ular, and presents a polygonal granoblastic texture (Fig. 7). 
It contains plagioclase, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, gar-
net and hornblende. Accessory minerals are apatite, zircon, 
rutile and opaque minerals.

Plagioclase varies compositionally between andesine-lab-
radorite (An37-54) and bytownite (An73), presenting hutten-
locher intergrowth (Smith &amp;amp; Brown 1974, Ribbe 1983), a 
characteristic of high temperature Ca-plagioclase.

Orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene (diopside) are par-
tially altered to hornblende. Two generations of hornblende 
are recognized: one is in equilibrium with pyroxenes and 
the other is the product of retrograde reaction.

Garnet forms coronitic microstructures and, in some 
cases, displays honeycomb-type texture surrounding pla-
gioclase, amphibole or pyroxene grains formed by the 
reaction Pl + Cpx1 (Opx) = Grt + Cpx2 + Qtz, typical 
of high-pressure metamorphism (Bard 1980, Best 1982, 
De Waard 1965, Harley 1985). In some other cases, the 
progression of this reaction forms larger poikiloblastic crys-
tals with abundant inclusions of orthopyroxene, plagioclase 
and opaque minerals.

The amphibolites form narrow or lens-shaped bodies within 
the mylonitic zone, oriented parallel to the main structural trend 
of NNE-SSW. They are mainly exposed along the eastern and 
western margins of the mylonitic domain. Their dimensions 
vary from metres to tens of kilometres. The largest of such bod-
ies are the Serra da Bocaina and Barreirinho Vermelho amphi-
bolites (Fig. 2). The first constitutes an 18-km long body with 
width ranging between 900 and 2,000 m. The Barreirinho 

Vermelho Amphibolite also comprises a lens-shaped body of 
approximately the same size and is also elongated parallel to 
the regional mylonitic foliation. Several other smaller bodies 
are also present in the gneissic-supracrustal domain. They pres-
ent nematoblastic or granoblastic texture and are formed 
by hornblende, diopside, calcic plagioclase (An63-75), minor 
amounts of titanite, biotite and quartz, and accessory apatite 
and opaque minerals (Fig. 8). Garnet amphibolites contain up

to 40% modal garnet, accompanied by labradorite (An50-56) 
and hornblende, and display porphyroblastic texture marked 
by ocellar garnet porphyroblasts. Coronitic textures are com-
mon, defined by garnet-clinopyroxene-quartz symplectites, 
which represent metamorphic reactions between plagioclase 
and clinopyroxene or hornblende. Amphibolites which do not 
contain garnet display a simple mineralogical association of 
calcic plagioclase, hornblende and titanite (up to 2% modal).

The metamorphic studies reveal that the Porangatu 
Complex comprises a high-grade metamorphic terrain that 
reached maximum metamorphic conditions in the granulite 
facies. Temperature and pressure above 850°C and 10 kbar 
are suggested by the following mineral parageneses: Opx 
+ Cpx + Qtz + Ca-Pl Antip ± Mc + Grt ± Bt (felsic gran-
ulites, enderbites and charnockites); Opx + Cpx + Ca-Pl 
± Hbl + Grt (mafic granulite); Ca-Pl + Cpx + Hbl ± Grt 
± Ttn (amphibolites). Moreover, the occurrence of small 
charnockitic bodies and veins (patch and veinlet migma-
tite structures) isolated in enderbites and mafic granulites 
are indicative of anatectic processes at high-temperature in 
almost anhydrous environment.

SHRIMP U-Pb Geochronology
For geochronological studies, samples were collected 

from two outcrops of the granulite terrain to the west of 
Cajueiro Village (Fig. 2). Zircon concentrates were obtained 
by conventional gravimetric and magnetic methods at the 
Institute of Geosciences of the Federal University of Pará. 
SHIRIMP U-Pb geochronological analyses were carried out 
by ion microprobe at the Research School of Earth Sciences, 
Australian National University, Canberra. Analytical work 
followed the general procedures described by Williams &amp;amp; 
Claesson (1987) and Compston et al. (1992). Concordia 
ages were calculated using Isoplot/Ex (http://www.bgc.org/
isoplot_etc/isoplot.html). Errors on ages reported in the fig-
ures and text are 2 sigma.

Two samples were selected for geochronology: a garnet 
mafic granulite and a charnockite. The latter represents small 
isolated bodies in garnet enderbite (see Fig. 6B), which are 
interpreted as anatectic melts formed at the climax of the 
granulite metamorphism.

Geochronological data for the mafic granulite (PO-07) are 
scattered (Tab. 1). Most analysed spots yield Paleoproterozoic 
ages between 1.8 and 2.2 Ga, although two spots give 
206Pb/238U ages of ca. 570 and 550 Ma, and another one, 
485 Ma. The high Th/U ratios for all spots (0.27–0.49) are 
typical of igneous zircon. In the Wetherill diagram (Fig. 9) 
the majority of the data fall around a Discordia with an 
upper intercept at 2092 ± 16 Ma and an imprecise lower 
intercept at 548 ± 48 Ma, albeit with a high MSWD (4.1). 
This rough alignment suggests late Neoproterozoic Pb-loss 

from Paleoproterozoic zircon formed at ca. 2.1 Ga, which is 
taken as the crystallization age of the protolith. The Pb-loss 
event is thought to be the high-temperature metamor-
phism, the age of which is better constrained by results on 
the charnockite.

In case of the charnockite (sample PO-40C), most 
zircons (22) gave Early Cambrian and Neoproterozoic 
206Pb/238U ages between 516 and 630 Ma (Table 2), with 
an upper intercept in the Wetherill concordia diagram 
at 583 ± 15 Ma (mean square of the weighted deviates – 
MSWD = 1.17) (Fig. 10A). Two groups are distinguished: 
(i) high Th/U (0.1 – 1.0, i.e., igneous grains) and (ii) low 
Th/U (0.01 – 0.04) metamorphic overgrowths that in cath-
odoluminescence images show as low luminescent rims 
around the igneous zircons, typical of metamorphic growth. 
Data for the first group (8 samples) give a Concordia age of 
581 ± 15 Ma (Fig. 10B), of which 5 cluster at 567 ± 12 Ma 
(Fig. 10C). The 206Pb/238U ages for the 14 low-Th/U zones 
range from 516 to 590 Ma, but the 9 most concordant of 
these give a Concordia age of 580 ± 8 Ma (Fig. 11). This 
is taken as clear evidence that the charnockite underwent 
high-T metamorphism at ca. 580 Ma, with possible slight 
Pb loss in some zircon. The age of the Neoproterozoic high 
Th/U grains in this rock cannot be distinguished from that 
of metamorphism and they are interpreted as having formed 
during the generation of charnockite neosomes in ender-
bite at granulite facies conditions; the combined age of this 
event is 577 ± 7 Ma.

There also are three older grains of 3.08, 1.96 
and 0.88 Ga (207Pb/206Pb ages) (Table 2). The Archaean and 
Paleoproterozoic ages have records in the Goiás Massif, 
and the 0.88 Ga inherited zircon grains are correlated with 
the Goiás Magmatic Arc.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Geological mapping, structural data combined with petro-
graphic and geochronological studies using the SHRIMP U-Pb 
technique of high-grade metamorphic rocks of the Porangatu 
Granulite Complex indicate the presence of Archaean and 
Paleoproterozoic continental crustal material, which was 
strongly reworked during Brasiliano orogeny. The field and 
structural data reveal the presence of Neoproterozoic granulitic 

rocks preserved within the wide, ductile, high-temperature 
NNE-SSW Talismã Shear Zone (TSZ), flanked to the east 
by older gneiss terrains. The granulite rocks are juxtaposed 
with medium-high grade mylonitic gneisses, representing 
a mixture of lower and middle crustal rocks.

The SHRIMP U-Pb geochronological data indicate that the 
protoliths of mafic granulite are Paleoproterozoic (ca. 2.1 Ga) 
which were metamorphosed under high-grade conditions at 
500-600 Ma, as indicated by an imprecise lower intercept

age. The high-grade metamorphism also caused anatexis 
resulting in charnockite derived from enderbite gneiss. U-Pb 
ages for anatectic igneous zircon and metamorphic zircon are 
indistinguishable within the limits of their combined age of 
580 ± 7 Ma. These Neoproterozoic ages for the granulite 

metamorphism are smaller than those reported for other gran-
ulites (ca. 0.65 Ga) within the Brasília Belt, suggesting that 
the evolution of the Porangatu Granulite Complex is more 
likely associated with the evolution of the younger Araguaia 
Belt, and suggests that the final closure of the Araguaia ocean 
separating the Amazonian and São Francisco-Congo Craton 
took place later than previously suggested.

The structural data for this region suggest a collisional 
setting initiated by oblique thrusts followed by a dextral 
strike-slip system (TSZ), which is part of the transcontinen-
tal Transbrasiliano-Kandi Lineament. It is likely, however, 
that the initial deformational features involved important 
thrust components, responsible for the exhumation of rocks 
of the lower crust such as large lenses of infracrustal granu-
lites (&gt; 30 km) with several elongated amphibolite and ana-
tetic granitoid bodies, all emplaced at the same crustal level 
as the old gneiss-migmatite terrains. The granulites are jux-
taposed with mylonitic gneisses, representing an important 
tectonic mixture of rock units of different crustal levels and 
ages (Archean, Paleoproterozoic, Neoproterozoic). The data 
suggest that charnockite PO-40C was emplaced at deep 
crustal levels and, therefore, igneous and metamorphic zir-
con crystals show essentially the same age (0.57 – 0.59 Ga). 
Inherited Archaean and Paleoproterozoic zircon grains indi-
cate the presence of older crustal material, as recorded in 
the Goiás Massif and Goiás Magmatic Arc.

Two relevant observations should be investigated in 
the future:
1. granulites and other metamorphic rocks, just to the west 

of the Serra Azul-Cajueiro Lineament, indicate younger 
high-grade metamorphic ages compared to the general 
pattern of Neoproterozoic granulites in other areas of

the Brasília Belt; for instance, granulites of the Uruaçu 
and Anápolis-Itauçu complexes have metamorphic zircon 
ages between ca. 0.65 - 0.63 Ga, approximately 60 Ma 
older than the Porangatu granulites; and

2. young high-grade rocks are identified in other areas 
along the TBL, for example granulitic rocks of Porto 
Nacional Complex associated with the Carreira Comprida 
Anorthosite further to the north, which yielded igneous 
age of ca. 0.53 Ga (Lima et al. 2008), and granitic orthog-
neisses in the region of São Miguel do Araguaia to the 
south, with U-Pb ages of ca. 0.57 - 0.53 Ga (Dantas 
et al. 2006, 2007).

These two observations probably mean that the high-grade 
rocks exposed roughly along the Transbrasiliano Lineament 
(TBL) may be related to late Neoproterozoic or even early 
Cambrian tectonic events along this shear zone, an event that 
is most likely related to the evolution of the Araguaia Belt, 
rather than to the Brasília Belt.

The metamorphic studies reveal that the Porangatu 
Complex comprises a high-grade metamorphic terrain which 
reached maximum metamorphic conditions in granulite facies, 
with temperatures above 850ºC and a pressure greater than 
10 kbar. This condition is suggested by the parageneses Opx + 
Cpx + Qtz + Ca-Pl Antip ± Mc + Grt ± Bt (felsic granulites, 
enderbites and charnockites); Opx + Cpx + Ca-Pl + Hbl + Grt 
(mafic granulite); Ca-Pl + Cpx + Hbl ± Grt ± Ttn (amphi-
bolites). Moreover, small bodies of charnockitic neosomes 
within the enderbitic and mafic granulites are the products 
of in situ anatexis during high-grade metamorphism in an 
anhydrous environment. Published data and those reported 
here indicate that the TBL is a high-grade ductile shear-zone 
superimposed and clearly discordant to the Brasilia Belt and 
that its age is ca. 570-580 Ma, i.e., Late Neoproterozoic.

Along the TBL from the center of Tocantins State as far 
as the northwest of Ceará are mega-lenses of granulitic rocks 
representing slices of the lower crust in the aligned NNE-
SSW direction. The main representatives are the granulitic 
complexes of Porangatu, Porto Nacional, Granja, Cariré and 
Macaco (Gorayeb 1996a, Gorayeb &amp;amp; Abreu 1998, Gorayeb 
et al. 2000, Amaral et al., 2012, Praxedes et al. 2012). These 
bodies are closely associated with high temperature ductile 
shear zones in several branches of the TBL and record of the 

initial stages of the continental collision, which led to the exhu-
mation of infracrustal rocks at the end of the Neoproterozoic. 
In spite of the great distances between these granulitic bod-
ies, the common point in addition to the reworking in shear 
zones is the similarity in the age of the high-grade metamor-
phism in the Neoproterozoic (Granja - 572 ± 32 Ma; Cariré 
- ca. 589 Ma) on Paleoproterozoic protolith, which are coin-
cident with the ages of Porangatu. The age of the TBL is still 
imprecise, and requires specific studies in the high-temperature 
mylonite zones. However, anorogenic granitic plutons from 
the Lageado suite dated between 552 and 545 Ma (Gorayeb 
et al. 2013) cut the granulitic rocks and TBL structures, at 
the end of the Neoproterozoic. Emplacement of these plu-
tons is related to an extensional tectonic system represent-
ing reactivation of this lineament. This makes it possible to 
bracket the formation of the TBL between approximately 
550 and 580 Ma.

We may compare the geological data of the granulitic 
rocks of Porangatu with those of Porto Nacional to the 
north (Gorayeb et al. 2000), and the Cariré Granulite Belt 
in northwestern Ceará (Gorayeb &amp;amp; Abreu 1989, Santos 
et al. 2008a, 2008b). The structural and geochronologi-
cal characteristics are very similar and reveal an intimate 
association with TBL, which can be interpreted as repre-
senting lower portions (roots) of the Tocantins Orogen at 
570 - 580 Ma. The data presented here are significant for 
the evolutionary understanding of the Brasiliano system, 
and consequently of the geology of central Brazil, and even 
for West Gondwana amalgamation.
