PLASMID PROFILE IN ORAL Fusobacterium nucleatum FROM HUMANS AND Cebus apella MONKEYS

Marcia O. PAULA(1), Elerson GAETTI-JARDIM Jr.(2) &amp;amp; Mario J. AVILA-CAMPOS(3)

SUMMARY

Fusobacterium nucleatum is a strict anaerobe and is indigenous of the human oral cavity. This organism is commonly recovered
from different monomicrobial and mixed infections in humans and animals. In this study, the plasmid profile, the plasmid stability
and the penicillin-resistance association in oral F. nucleatum isolated from periodontal patients, healthy subjects and Cebus apella
monkeys were evaluated. Forty-five F. nucleatum strains from patients, 38 from healthy subjects and seven from C. apella were
identified and analyzed. Plasmid extraction was performed in all the isolated strains. These elements were found in 26.7% strains
from patients and one strain from C. apella. Strains from healthy subjects did not show any plasmid. Most of strains showed two
plasmid bands ranging from 4 to 16 Kb, but digestions with endonucleases showed that they belonged to a single plasmid. The
plasmid profile was similar and stable in human and monkey strains. Also, plasmids were classified into three groups according to
size. Two strains were positive to ?-lactamase production and no plasmid DNA-hybridization with a ?-lactamase gene probe was
observed, suggesting a chromosomal resistance.

KEYWORDS: Plasmid; Gene; Fusobacterium nucleatum; Cebus apella.

INTRODUCTION

Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative rod, non-spore-
forming, non-motile and a strictly anaerobic organism. This bacterium
is indigenous of the human and animal oral cavity, and has been involved
in several infectious processes such as sinusitis, osteomyelitis, brain or
liver abscesses2,3. Also, F. nucleatum is a putative pathogen involved in
the development of gingivitis in children and adults and of periodontitis
in juveniles and adults5,11.

Despite the large knowledge about the pathogenic potential and
medical aspects of fusobacteria, their metabolic and genetic aspects are
little known6. In the last years, the use of tools as cloning, sequencing
and PCR have given more information about the genetic aspects of F.
nucleatum2,5.

In other microbial groups, several virulence factors have been
observed and these factors can be mediated by extrachromosomal DNA
elements carrying genes able to synthesize substances destroying host
tissues. These factors play an important role in ecological terms,
regulating or limiting many microorganisms in their ecosystems. The
presence of plasmids in F. nucleatum has already been reported10.

In this study, the plasmid profile in oral F. nucleatum isolated from
periodontal patients, health subjects and Cebus apella monkeys, the

plasmid stability and the penicillin-resistance genes association with
plasmids were evaluated. Monkeys were used because of anatomic
similarities with the human oral cavity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

1. Bacterial isolation and identification: Subgingival plaque
samples from 30 patients with adult periodontitis (age range 18-40 years)
from the Periodontology Clinic of Dentistry School, University of São
Paulo (SP, Brazil), without sex or race distinction, with clinic and
radiographic evidences of periodontitis, including periodontal pockets
? 5 mm were collected. None of them received antibiotics for at least
six-month prior to the sample collection. Subgingival dental plaques
from 30 periodontally healthy dental students (age range 19-35 years),
without sex or race distinction, and without evidences of periodontal
disease, were collected. Healthy students did not take antimicrobials six
month prior to the sample collection. Also, subgingival plaques from
ten Cebus apella monkeys (Experimental Center for Macaco-Prego,
UNESP, São Paulo, SP) without evidences of periodontal disease were
collected, after injected with Nembutal?1.

Samples were dispersed by vortex for 60 seconds and serial dilutions
were performed. Aliquots of 0.1 ml of each dilution were transferred
onto blood agar and OMATA &amp;amp; DISRAELY agar13, and incubated in
atmosphere with 90% N

PAULA, M.O.; GAETTI-JARDIM Jr., E. &amp;amp; AVILA-CAMPOS, M.J. - Plasmid profile in oral Fusobacterium nucleatum from humans and Cebus apella monkeys. Rev. Inst. Med. trop. S.
Paulo, 45(1):5-9, 2003.

Bacterial identification was performed according to BENNETT &amp;amp;
DUERDEN3, HOLT et al.7 and SUMMANEN et al.20. Reference strains
F. nucleatum ATCC 10953 and F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 were included
in all the tests. Identified strains were stored in glycerol (20%, -70 oC)
and lyophilized.

2. Plasmid profile and stability: Plasmid DNA extraction was
performed using a PANTOSTI et al.14 method. Briefly, 5 ml of culture
in BHI broth supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract (BHIS, Difco
Laboratories) were centrifuged (5,000 x g, 5 minutes) (Jouan, model
A-14), and the pellet washed in TES buffer (50 mM Tris, 50 mM Na Cl,
5 mM EDTA), resuspended in 100 µg of solution I (25 mM Tris, 50 mM
glucose, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) with 2 mg/ml of lysozyme (Amresco)
and incubated at 37 oC, for 15 minutes. 200 µl of solution II (0.2 N
NaOH, 1% SDS) were added to tubes, and incubated on ice for
5 min. Then, 150 µl of solution III (3M sodium acetate, pH 4.8) were
added and incubated on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation (10,000 x g,
15 minutes, Eppendorf, model 5402), the supernatant was treated with
equal volumes of phenol: chloroform (1:1). Aqueous phase was
precipitated with 2 volumes of cold ethanol and stored at –20 oC, for
30 minutes. After centrifugation (10,000 x g, 15 minutes), the pellet was
dried and resuspended in 40 µl of TE buffer (10 mM sodium acetate,
1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) with 20 µg/ml of RNase (10 mg/ml) and incubated
at room temperature for 30 min. Obtained DNA was stored at –20 oC.
Also, 10 µl of DNA were run in a 0.7% agarose gel (type II, Sigma) by
electrophoresis in 0.5 X TBE buffer (1 M Tris, 0.9 M Boric acid, 0.01 M
EDTA, pH 8.4). DNA extraction for each strain was three times repeated.
Plasmid molecular weights were estimated by comparison with the
standard weight Supercoiled DNA Ladder (Gibco BRL).

For evaluation of the plasmid stability, plasmid-positive strains were
submitted to 50 successive cultures in BHIS, with intervals of 48-72 h.
Plasmid extraction was performed every 10 subcultures as described
above14.

3. ?-lactamase production: The ?-lactamase production by
penicillin-resistant strains was evaluated. Briefly, strains were grown in
5 ml of BHIS, and after 20 µl were inoculated, in duplicate, onto BHIS
agar with penicillin G (Wyeth Laboratories) in concentrations ranging
from 1 to 64 µg/ml. Inoculated plates were incubated in anaerobiosis, at
37 oC, for 72 h. Bacterial growth were treated with chloroform vapors
for 20 minutes, then plates were opened for 20 minutes until chloroform
evaporation. After, 5.0 ml of semi-solid BHIS (0.7% agar) inoculated
with 0.1 ml of F. nucleatum ATCC 10953 (susceptible to penicillin G)
were pour-plated. Plates were incubated in anaerobiosis, at 37 oC, for
48 h. ?-lactamase production was observed by a growth halo around of
the producer strain.

4. Plasmid DNA restriction and Southern blot: Plasmid DNA
was extracted by using two based BIRNBOIM &amp;amp; DOLY4 protocols with
modifications, where several precipitations with sodium acetate and cold
ethanol, and additional treatments with phenol and phenol-chloroform
were performed. All the isolated strains were grown into 200 ml of BHIS.
A Wizard Plus Maxipreps DNA Purification System (Promega) was also
used in accordance to the manufacturer indications. Lyses method by
boiling and plasmid purification by cesium-chlorate-ethidium bromide
(CsCl-EtBr) gradient were also used according to SAMBROOK et al.18.
All DNA samples were purified by using a Sequenase Sequencing System

protocol (DNA was dissolved in 0.4 ml of ultra pure Milli-Q water,
0.1 ml of 4 M NaCl and 0.5 ml of 13% PEG

8000
. After homogenization,

tubes were incubated at 4 oC, for 30 minutes, and centrifuged at 10,000
x g, for 15 minutes. DNA was dried at room temperature and resuspended
in TE buffer).

0.1 µg to 0.5 µg of DNA samples were restricted overnight with
endonucleases: BamH I, Bgl II, EcoR I, Hinc II, Hind III, Pst I and Sal
I (New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer. Plasmid molecular
fragments weights were determined by using a lambda DNA-Hind III
digested as a standard weight (New England Biolabs) and an Eagle-Eye
program.

4.1. Probe to ?-lactamase: ?-lactamase gene probe from pUC18
plasmid ampicillin-resistance gene was obtained18. Plasmid pUC18 was
restricted with Sca I and Bsa I, producing a 2.3 Kb and 0.4 Kb bands. The
0.4 Kb band was eluted and purified by using a PrepA Gene? System protocol
(Life Science Research Products Bio-Rad), and a DIG-DNA Labeling and
Detection Kit (Boehringer Mannheim) was used as probe marker.

4.2. Southern blot: Plasmid samples from penicillin-resistant F.
nucleatum were obtained. Also, a DNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae
strain IH # 1784 (Herskowitz, I., Univ. California, San Francisco, USA)
as a negative control, a plasmid pUC18 as a positive control, and a
standard 1 Kb DNA Ladder (Gibco BRL) were used.

The membrane transference using a nylon membrane (Zeta-Probe
Blotting Membrane - Life Science Research Products Bio-Rad) in a
vacuum blotting system (Pharmacia, LKB, Biotechnology) was
performed. A denature solution (1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaOH) was added
for 20 minutes and then, a neutralizing solution (1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M
Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1.0 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) was used for 20 min.
Transference was performed changing the neutralizing solution for a
transference solution (20 X SSC, 3 M NaCl, 0.3 M Tri-sodium citrate,
pH 7.0), for 1 h. Membrane was washed in 10 X SSC solution and dried
on filter paper at room temperature, and DNA was fixed with UV light
for 3 min.

4.3. Hybridization: Nylon membrane was pre-hybridized with
20 ml of pre-hybridization solution (5X SSC, 0.1% N-laurosilsarcosine,
0.02% SDS, 1% blocking reagent from DIG-DNA labeling and detection
kit), at 65 oC, for 3 h using a hybridization machine (Hybaid Model
Maxi 14). This solution was discarded and 20 ml of pre-hybridization
solution with 100 ng/µl of a denatured ?-lactamase probe (100 oC,
10 minutes) were added, and hybridization was performed overnight.
Membrane was washed twice with a washing solution I (2X SSC, 0.1%
SDS) for 5 min, at room temperature. Washing solution II (0.1X SSC,
0.1% SDS) was used twice for additional washing, at 65 oC, for
15 minutes. Membrane was dried and revelation was performed. Another
hybridization at low stringent conditions was also performed.

45 strains (26.7%) from periodontal patients and in 1 out of 7 strains
from C. apella monkeys. All the strains showed two plasmid bands except
strain D82 that showed four bands. Bands were approximately between
4 Kb and ? 16 Kb (Table 1). Strains harboring plasmids were recovered
from different patients, except strains D40 and D41, which belonged to
a single patient. No strain from healthy subjects harbored plasmids. Also,
the plasmid profile of the monkey strain (M6) was similar to the human
strains (D33, D40 and D41). Isolates D6, D33, D40 and D82 from
periodontal patients showed plasmids, but these strains were lost during
maintenance and were not used for plasmid DNA analysis.

Table 2 shows the plasmid presence during subcultures at different
times. Reference strain F. nucleatum ATCC 10953 did not show any
plasmids. In the other strains, plasmids appeared at least twice or more
times, showing the same molecular weight during subcultures.

?-lactamase production: Two penicillin-resistant human strains (D1
and D12) produced ?-lactamase enzyme.

Plasmid DNA restriction: Plasmid-positive strains (D1, D3, D12,
D17, D41, D81, D84, D513, D518 and M6) were submitted for a maxi-
preps DNA extraction. Sometimes, a small DNA amount or no DNA or
degraded DNA was observed. No DNA sample was obtained with CsCl
gradient method.

DNA from strains D1, D12, and D81 were restricted with EcoR I,
and from D17 and D513 with Hinc II. EcoR I partially digested DNA
from strains D1, producing a 4.2 Kb band (Fig. 2), and D12 or D81,
producing a 5.8 Kb and 0.8 Kb bands (Fig. 1). Hinc II restricted DNA
from strain D17 producing a 3.1 Kb, 2.3 Kb and 1.1 Kb bands (Fig. 2),
and from D513, only a 6.0 Kb band. Endonucleases BamH I, Bgl II,
Hind III, Pst I and Sal I did not digest any DNA sample.

Hybridization: Plasmid DNA from penicillin-resistant (D1 and D12)
or susceptible (D81 and D17) F. nucleatum did not hybridize with ?-
lactamase probe. Similar results were observed when hybridization was
performed at low stringent conditions.

DISCUSSION

Extrachromosomal elements such as plasmids have been observed
in several bacterial species. These genetic elements may change the
bacterial physiologic properties increasing its pathogenic potential,
affecting the taxonomic position and spreading its properties to other
bacterial species.

suggest an association with some pathogenic factors. McKAY et al.10

reported the presence of plasmids (ranged from 6.0 to 6.6 Kb) in 18% of
the tested F. nucleatum isolated from periodontal patients and healthy
subjects, without distinction among both studied groups, and these
elements were considered cryptic. This is the only report of plasmids in
this group.

Plasmids were observed in 26.7% of the F. nucleatum recovered
from periodontal patients and in one (14%) out of seven strains recovered
from C. apella monkeys. However, no F. nucleatum recovered from
healthy subjects harbored plasmids. Plasmid profile in the animal strain
was similar to the human strains, suggesting a possible microbial cross-
transmission by water or food (among animals and keep-staff). On the
other hand, studies using a larger number of monkey and keep-staff strains
would be necessary to obtain any definitive conclusion.

Most of tested F. nucleatum was susceptible to penicillin G. However,
strains D1 and D12 were resistant to penicillin (256 µg/ml), maybe due
to a ?-lactamase production. Studies have reported a ?-lactamase
production in F. nucleatum, but no gene has been identified8,12,22,23,24.
Also, that high resistance observed in both strains (D1 and D12) suggests
the presence of any penicillin-resistance marker such as a plasmid or a
chromosomal gene. Bacterial plasmids codifying for antimicrobial
resistance have been frequently observed16,17,19,21.

The ?-lactamase production for strains D1 and D2 by chromosomal
or plasmid genes was detected by using a hybridization assay with a ?-
lactamase gene probe, and no hybridization was observed suggesting

that ?-lactamase production was chromosomally mediated or the used
probe from pUC18 did not show any homology with genes belonging to
Fusobacterium spp. Most of sequenced ?-lactamases genes from different
bacterial groups, such as Salmonella, Klebsiella, Mycobacterium,
Lysobacter, Nocardia and Streptomyces, showed some homology (&gt;
55%) with Escherichia coli genes (GenBank data). On the other hand,
LIVERMORE9 showed differences among ?-lactamases mediated for
plasmid and chromosome. In Bacteroides fragilis, plasmid genes
producing ?-lactamases may be different from those observed in
enterobacteria or other aerobic Gram-negative bacteria 16.

Presence of plasmid was stable during bacterial subcultures, but these
elements were present or absent in some DNA extractions, suggesting
that technical problems can be a trouble in plasmid isolation and
observation. The Mini-prep and Maxi-prep plasmid DNA extraction
protocols were used, but the DNA amounts obtained in Mini-prep where
small and enough only to visualize Max-prep protocols didn’t get enough
DNA in all strains for endonucleases digestion. Also, sometimes the
DNA was degrated. This DNA degradation might be due to DNase
enzymes produced by F. nucleatum15. McKAY et al.10 also reported that
small DNA amounts are commonly recovered from this microbial group.

In this study, only EcoR I and Hinc II were able to restrict plasmid
DNA from the tested F. nucleatum. The same endonucleases restricted
the plasmids isolated by McKAY et al.10. Also, endonucleases BamH I,
Bgl II, Hind III, Pst I and Sal I, did not digest any isolated plasmid. In
addition, BamH I, Pst I and Sal I recognize sites rich in G and also did
not restricted McKAY et al. isolated plasmids. It is well known that F.
nucleatum has a low G + C content (27% - 28%), and it might explain
why these enzymes were not able to restrict plasmid from F. nucleatum.

Plasmid DNA from strains D12 and D81 were restricted with EcoR
I and produced two 5.8 and 0.8 Kb bands, suggesting a true molecular
weight of approximately 6.6 Kb. Also, the two observed bands  in the
intact plasmid with sizes between 10 and 12 Kb, and between 6 and 7
Kb, belong to a single plasmid, but in two different forms. Plasmid from
strain D17 was restricted with Hinc II and three bands with approximately
3.1, 2.3 and 1.1 Kb were observed, suggesting a molecular weight of
6.5 Kb. Plasmid DNA from strain D513 was restricted with Hinc II in a
unique site, producing an approximately 6.0 Kb band. Our data show
that strains D12, D81, D17 and D513 harbored plasmids with similar
size (Table 1). Plasmid from strains D12 and D81 showed two common
sites for Eco RI, while plasmids from strains D17 and D513 showed a
different restriction profile. Also, a partial DNA digestion from strain
D1 was obtained with EcoR I, producing a 4.2 Kb band (whole plasmid
size).

After restriction analysis, plasmids were grouped according to their
molecular weight: group I, approximately 4.2 Kb; group II, between 6.0
and 6.6 Kb; and group III, between 12 and 16 Kb. Plasmids from group
III were not digested due to the small DNA amount obtained. In addition,
plasmids belonging to the second group were also reported by McKAY
et al.10, but no function was observed.

Certainly, these results indicate the need of a better plasmid
characterization of the F. nucleatum species identifying their genetic content
and determining in ecologic and pathogenic terms the role that these elements,
still considered cryptic, could play in human periodontal processes.

RESUMO

Perfil plasmidial de Fusobacterium nucleatum isolados da
cavidade bucal de humanos e primatas Cebus apella

Fusobacterium nucleatum é um anaeróbio estrito e considerado
membro da microbiota indígena da cavidade bucal humana. É comumente
observado em diferentes infecções monomicrobianas e mistas em
humanos e animais. O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar o perfil plasmidial
de F. nucleatum orais isolados de pacientes com doença periodontal,
indivíduos sadios, e de macacos Cebus apella, e verificar a estabilidade
plasmidial e a associação com genes de resistência à penicilina. Quarenta
e cinco cepas de F. nucleatum orais isoladas de pacientes, 38 de indivíduos
sadios e sete de macacos C. apella, foram examinadas. A extração
plasmidial realizada detectou plasmídios em 26,7% das cepas humanas
e em apenas uma cepa de C. apella. A maioria das cepas apresentou
duas bandas plasmidiais variando de 4 a 16 Kb, e as digestões com
endonucleases demonstraram serem essas bandas pertencentes a um único
plasmídio, sendo classificados em três grupos segundo o tamanho. Cepas
de indivíduos sadios não abrigaram plasmídios. O perfil plasmidial foi
similar e estável nas cepas isoladas de humanos e de macacos. Duas
cepas foram ?-lactamase-positivas, e não se observou hibridização de
DNA plasmidial com a sonda do gene da ?-lactamase, sugerindo-se que
a resistência à penicilina nestas cepas é cromossômica.
