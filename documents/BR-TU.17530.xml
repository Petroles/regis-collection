ABSTRACT

Age determinations using the 235U and 238U radioactive decay series to the daughter isotopes 207Pb and 206Pb,

respectively, using the mineral zircon (ZrSiO4), are widely used to decipher geological processes. A new method

developed in the last couple of years, the laser ablation multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry

(LA-MC-ICP-MS), overcomes previous laborious sample preparation, and yields isotopic ratios and age data with a

high spatial resolution of ten of microns. The present study describes the analytical set-up and data reduction process

as presently applied at the Laboratory for Geochronology of the University of Brasília. It explores the precision and

accuracy of the method by cross-analysing three international zircon standards. We arrive at a precision of 1.9 to 3.7%

(2? SD) and an accuracy of 0.6 to 3.8% (2? SD) for and U isotopic ratios of the standards. We also apply the method

to two natural zircon samples, which have previously been dated by other analytical methods. A comparison of the

results shows a good conformity of the age data, being within the error limits. The data demonstrate the great analytical

potential of the method for rapid, precise and accurate U-Pb isotopic analyses on the micron scale.

Key words: geochronology, U-Pb isotopes, LA-MC-ICP-MS, zircon, age dating.

INTRODUCTION

Absolute age determinations in the geosciences serve
for a variety of applications including geotectonic stud-
ies, sedimentation ages and sediment provenance, as
well as dating of igneous and metamorphic rocks. They
use the decay of a radioactive isotope in a natural min-
eral with a half-life favourable for the expected age of
the material or process investigated. Many of these
applications are conducted in materials of considerable
age (millions to billions of years), which suggests the
use of the radioactive uranium isotopes 235U and 238U
with half-lifes of 7.04 × 108 and 4.47 × 109 years,
and the radiogenic daughter isotopes 207Pb and 206Pb,

respectively. Analysis of the parent and daughter iso-
topes allows the determination of the crystallization age
of the mineral. The mineral analysed should show cer-
tain physicochemically favourable characteristics, such
as high resistance to chemical exchange and recrystal-
lization, and reasonably high U and radiogenic Pb con-
tents for analysis, amongst others. These are met by
the abundantly occurring mineral zircon (ZrSiO4) which
is, therefore, the most traditional and widely used min-
eral for age determinations of various geological appli-
cations (e.g. Garbe-Schönberg and Arpe 1997, Košler et
al. 2002).

Apart from the improvement in precision, accuracy
and mass resolution on the detector side of the instru-
mental set-up, a new method of material sampling is
gaining more and more importance. Instead of the in-

troduction of the sample in aqueous solution, a laser
microprobe for sampling of solid material on the micron
scale is connected to an ionization cell, which ionizes the
sampled material in an inductively coupled plasma (ICP)
and supplies single-charged ions to a magnetic sector or
quadrupole mass spectrometer. The technique is referred
to as “laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectro-
metry” (LA-ICP-MS). It avoids the laborious sample
cleaning, dissolution and element separation in an ultra-
clean laboratory environment required by the traditional
isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry
(ID-TIMS). Since the pioneering work by Feng et al.
(1993) and Hirata and Nesbitt (1995), significant analyt-
ical progress of the LA-ICP-MS method was achieved
(see Vanhaecke and Moens 1999, Günther et al. 2000,
Horn et al. 2000, Stirling et al. 2000, Simonetti et al.
2006, Paquette and Tiepolo 2007, Simon et al. 2007).

In this study, advances of this particular dating
method, the multi-collector inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) coupled to a laser
microprobe, which has recently been set up at the Geo-
chronology Laboratory of the University of Brasilia, are
reported. We present results of three international zir-
con standards cross-calibrated one against the other, and
two natural zircon samples which have previously been
analysed by other analytical methods. The data demon-
strate the capacity of the method in terms of rapid, pre-
cise and accurate U and Pb isotope analyses with high
spatial resolution.

RATIONALE

For the case of two radioactive isotopes of a single el-
ement, as for the decay systems of 238U and 235U, the
ratios between the stable decay products and the radio-
active parent isotopes (206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U) are
interrelated. Given closed-system conditions, they plot
on a curve which extends from today towards the forma-
tion of the Earth and the solar system at approximately
4.53 Ga ago (Fig. 1). The ratios have to concord one to
the other following the relationship:

206Pb
238U

=
( 207Pb

235U
+ 1

)?238U/?235U
? 1 (1)

and define the “Concordia curve”, with ? being the decay
constant of the respective radioactive isotope. Another

age information can be obtained by the 207Pb/206Pb age,
based on the relationship:

207Pb
206Pb

=
235U
238U

×
(e?235U×t ? 1)

(e?238U×t ? 1)
(2)

With the constant present-day 238U/235U ratio of 137.88,
this age information considers only the daughter iso-
topes. Hence, the more accurate and valid age infor-
mation is obtained from the 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U
isotope ratios.

erals with a contribution of common Pb to the bulk Pb content plot

ting on a Discordia line with the upper intercept indicating the age of

There are two fundamental problems with this
method. Firstly, the material analysed may contain ini-
tial common Pb of non-radiogenic origin. The non-
radiogenic Pb fraction displaces the isotope analyses to-
wards values below the Concordia curve (Fig. 1). The
problem of this “common Pb” content can be resolved
by correction procedures using crustal 206Pb/204Pb and
207Pb/204Pb compositions. These Pb isotope ratios, how-
ever, change with time in terrestrial materials, due to the
radiogenic growth of 206Pb and 207Pb from the decay
of 238U and 235U, respectively. The respective, time-
dependant isotope ratio used for correction may be cal-
culated from the average crustal Pb isotopic composi-
tion, or may directly be analysed in cogenetic minerals
which contain predominantly common, and little radio-
genic Pb.

Pb AND U ISOTOPE ANALYSIS BY LA-MC-ICP-MS 101

In order to avoid these corrections, it is always more
effective to analyse minerals which, due to their crystal
lattice characteristics, contain sufficient U to analyse the
parent and the daughter isotope but, on the other hand,
do not accommodate common Pb in the structure, be-
cause of the mismatch between ionic charge and effec-
tive ionic radius (Shannon 1976). These are, for ex-
ample, zircon (ZrSiO4) or monazite (Ce,La,Nd,Th)PO4,
which generally contain sufficient U to be analysed,
ranging from 1 to &gt; 10000 ppm for zircon and 282 to
&gt; 50000 ppm for monazite (Heaman and Parish 1991).
The common Pb content of the two minerals is gener-
ally (but not always) very low.

Secondly, the system must have been closed to the
gain or loss of the parent and daughter isotopes. In most
cases, we deal with a loss of radiogenic lead which can
be easily mobilized by geological processes because, as
in the case of zircon, radiogenic Pb2+ does not fit the
Zr4+ ion characteristics (Mezger and Krogstad 1997).
The result is that the isotopic analyses plot on a “Dis-
cordia line” which intersects the Concordia curve twice
(Fig. 1): the upper intercept generally represents the
time of crystallization of the mineral; the lower inter-
cept may, in cases, be interpreted as the geological event
when the crystal lost part of his radiogenic lead. Min-
eral standards for isotopic analyses by LA-ICP-MS or
ion microprobe should meet these two requirements, i.e.
they should be concordant, and void of common lead.

METHOLOGICAL PROGRESS OF Pb-U ISOTOPIC
ANALYSIS

Conventional Pb-U analyses for absolute age determi-
nation of geological materials commonly use the tech-
nique of ID-TIMS (Isotope Dilution Thermal Ioniza-
tion Mass Spectrometry). Sample preparation is labori-
ous (e.g. Nebel-Jacobsen et al. 2005, Amelin and Davis
2006). The minerals have to be separated from the rock
matrix, cleaned and sometimes abraded if the outer
margins show alteration features (Mattinson 2005). The
minerals are dissolved, and the Pb and U isotopes sep-
arated by resin columns in an ultra-clean laboratory to
allow sub-nanogram Pb isotopic analysis. The solutions
are deposited on rhenium filaments for thermal ioniza-
tion and introduction of the ionized species into a mag-
netic sector mass spectrometer.

This techniques has been successfully applied for
decades and is still commonly used for U-Pb age deter-
minations and other isotopic geochemical applications
worldwide. Low-blank laboratories normally achieve a
very high precision of the age determinations (Parrish
and Noble 2003, Krymsky et al. 2007). However, short-
comings of the technique are the need to separate the
minerals from the matrix, the lack of spatial resolution
of the analyses, and the laborious wet chemical prepara-
tion under ultra-clean laboratory conditions. On the other
hand, the quality of the analyses is excellent, reaching
precisions down to ? 0.1% for the Pb/U isotopic ratios
(e.g., Mattinson 2005).

Another method which overcomes the need for wet
chemical preparation is the Sensitive High Resolution
Ion Micro Probe (SHRIMP). It focuses a high-energy
ion beam (usually O?2 ) onto an area of usually &amp;lt;30?m
for in situ isotopic analysis of minerals such as zircon.
The method reaches a precision and accuracy of about
1.0% (e.g., Cocherie et al. 2005). The SIMS method
(Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry), on the other hand,
employs a primary ion beam and analyses the ejected
secondary ions. It focuses an O? ion beam of typically
&gt; 10?m in diameter on a solid sample surface, and is
primarily applied to quantify major and trace element
contents (for example, Pettke et al. 2004).

Many recent analytical methods, instead, use an
“Inductively coupled plasma” ionization method (ICP)
of the sample, generating a fine aerosol which is ionized
in an Ar plasma (Horn et al. 2000). With Ar having a
high first ionization potential of 15.759 V, the plasma
ionizes all other elements to single-charged ions except
for He, F and Ne. The method was developed in the
early 1980s for introduction of dissolved samples.
Likewise, the ICP array may be connected to a laser
system which ablates a solid sample whose vaporized
material is then transported by a He gas flow into the
ICP unit. This method overcomes the need of ultra-clean
laboratory conditions and allows the selective sampling
of solid material on the micrometer scale. On the de-
tector side, the recent technology came up with multi-
collector (MC) arrangements which allow the simulta-
neous detection of the relative abundance of various
isotopes (see Simonetti et al. 2005). The conventional
Faraday cup detectors (normally 9 in a line) may be

equipped with additional multichannel ion counters
(MICs) for high-sensitivity isotope analyses. The equip-
ment with additional MICs is only a spatial problem
within the Faraday cup arrangement and, generally,
6–8 MICs may easily be accommodated, allowing the
simultaneous analysis of about 15 isotopes.

The shortcomings of the laser ablation multi-col-
lector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(LA-MC-ICP-MS) relative to SHRIMP or conventional
TIMS analyses have been its lower precision. The laser
ablation process is not as stable as the SHRIMP method,
or as the introduction of the sample in solution as in
the case of TIMS. Firstly, this is due to the fragmenta-
tion and vaporization process of the solid material ab-
lated. The laser beam may ablate parts of the mineral
which are slightly fractured, altered or otherwise phys-
ically weakened or inhomogenized by previous geolog-
ical processes, including the destruction of the mineral
lattice by the proper radioactive radiation. The result is
that the ablation and vaporization process of the mate-
rial may vary in efficiency and completeness and, thus,
the material transport to the plasma may not be contin-
uous. Secondly, the carrier gas flux, normally ultrapure
He, has an appreciable effect on the stability of the gas
flow. Hence, the laser settings, such as laser intensity,
laser frequency and beam diameter, together with the
gas flow parameters, are fundamental for a reasonably
stable signal reaching the detectors.

With the more recent developments, however, the
analytical uncertainties are getting closer to those of
SHRIMP (see Willigers et al. 2002). Bruguier et al.
(2001) arrived at 6%, Horn et al. (2000) at 2%, Chang
et al. (2006) at 4%, and Gerdes and Zeh (2006) at
3–4% precision or accuracy for U-Pb isotope ratios of
natural materials. These values depend very much on
the nature of the material analysed, such as its com-
position, presence of fractures, inclusions and hetero-
geneities. The LA-ICP-MS analyses may be even more
precise for synthetic glass standards which are chemi-
cally and isotopically homogeneous (Bernal et al. 2005).
Often, the largest uncertainty is given by the analysis
of the standards (Chang et al. 2006) which are gener-
ally natural minerals including all the potential pitfalls.
With a precision of that magnitude, however, with the
control of the spatial resolution of the material anal-

ysed, and with the relatively easy preparation of the
samples, the laser ablation MC-ICP mass spectrometry
certainly is the method of choice for the coming years
for isotopic analysis of solid materials in the geo- and
environmental sciences (Willigers et al. 2002, Košler
and Sylvester 2003).

SET-UP OF THE LASER ABLATION
MC-ICP-MS U-Pb METHOD

The analytical equipment used in this study was installed
at the “Laboratório de estudos geocronológicos, geo-
dinâmicos e ambientais” of the Geosciences Institute
of the University of Brasília, Brasília, Brazil, by ini-
tiative of Petróleo Brasileiro S/A – PETROBRAS and
the “Ministério de Minas e Energia”. The laboratory is
part of the “Rede de Estudos Geodinâmicos e Ambien-
tais – GEOCHRONOS”. It was inaugurated in Decem-
ber 2006 and consists, apart from other installations and
instrumentation, of a Thermo Finnigan Neptune multi-
collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer.
Attached to this is a New Wave 213?m Nd-YAG solid
state laser which provides the ablated material to the
mass spectrometer.

SAMPLE PREPARATION

Sample preparation is straightforward. The minerals of
interest, in this case zircon, are separated from the rock
matrix by crushing the rock, concentrating the heavy
mineral fraction by panning, separating the zircon grains
by a Frantz magnetic separator, and final hand-picking
of individual zircon grains. In situ analysis directly on
a rock slab or thin section is also possible. However,
it was found that the procedure of pre-concentration
largely facilitates the measurements and localization of
the zircons, so that it is worthwhile to be done.

The zircon grains are then located under the binoc-
ular one by one on a glass wafer covered with a double-
sided tape in order to secure the grains. A 9 mm diameter
plastic ring is placed on the tape around the zircons, and
filled with two-compound epoxy. After 1-2 days of dry-
ing, the mounts are removed from the tape. Polishing of
the mounts is done with 3?m followed by 1 ?m diamond
paste in order to expose unaltered and clean zircon sur-
faces. It is advisable to locate the grains on existing flat
crystal surfaces (if present) to avoid excessive polishing.

Pb AND U ISOTOPE ANALYSIS BY LA-MC-ICP-MS 103

The mounts are then taken to an ultrasonic bath with 3%
HNO3, and then cleaned with distilled water. A Nylon
sample holder which takes three mounts was especially
constructed. The three sites may be occupied with one
standard and two samples, or with two standards and one
sample.

THE LASER SET-UP

The sample chamber is flushed with He gas of analyt-
ical quality, which samples the ablated and vaporized
material to be transported via Tygon tubes into the ICP.
Before entering the laser sample chamber, the He passes
through a glass tube filled with gold-coated quartz crys-
tals (gold trap) to remove the largest part of mercury
(Hg) whose isotope 204Hg interferes with the 204Pb iso-
tope analysed to apply the common Pb correction. The
He gas flux is commonly 0.35–0.45 L/min.

The laser is run at a frequency of 7–10 Hz and
an energy of 30–36%, resulting in a laser energy of ca.
0.5 to 1.2 J/cm2. A small laser spot size of say 30?m
applied to a single spot with these laser conditions would
not produce enough material for a reasonable signal, but
at least 40–50?m would be required, with the signal
intensity deteriorating along duration of the analysis be-
cause of the deepening of the laser pit. This suggested
the use of a raster scheme of the laser which samples
only the surface of the zircon. The raster is composed of
two parallel and a connecting line with a 20?m spacing.
With a 30?m beam diameter applied here, the sampled
area of the zircon is a square of about 70?m on each
side. With a speed of 1?m/sec, the propagating laser
spot takes about 1 min to pass the raster, which is enough
time to collect the signal. This setting also avoids the
prominent down-hole fractionation of isotopes which
would require an additional correction, and a signifi-
cantly higher laser energy to drill the zircon. Before
signal collection, a pre-ablation run along the raster is
applied to clean the mineral surface. The running con-
ditions of this cleaning run are: 40?m spot size, fre-
quency 10 Hz and 25% laser energy.

THE ICP-MS AND MULTI-COLLECTOR SET-UP

Before entering the plasma, the He gas coming from the
laser with the ablated material, is combined with Ar gas
of analytical quality which sustains the plasma. The de-

tector arrangement consists of a central Faraday cup and
4 Faraday cups each on the high side and low side of the
centre cup (Fig. 2). For high-sensitivity analyses of the
Pb and U isotopes, the mass spectrometer is equipped
with 6 ion counters (ICs, or multichannel ion counters
MICs). Four of them are fixed on the outermost Faraday
cup of the low side (cup L4), one on the third cup of the
low side (cup L3), and one on the outermost Faraday cup
on the high side (cup H4). The latter is used only for
the analysis of 238U in materials with extremely low U
content. For the present application, we analysed 238U
on the Faraday cup H4. The other isotopes are collected
on the low side. The four ICs on the cup L4 are fixed
at defined distances referring to: one mass unit between
L4 and IC5, one mass unit between IC5 and IC4, two
mass units between IC4 and IC3, and two mass units
between IC3 and IC2. The signals collected on the four
ICs are: 207Pb on IC5, 206Pb on IC4, 204Hg/204Pb on
IC3, and 202Hg on IC2. Because of the always present
contamination of the He gas with Hg, a correction for
the isobaric interference between 204Hg and 204Pb has
to be applied, using the signal of 202Hg collected on IC2.

DATA COLLECTION

With this collector set-up, five isotopes are analysed si-
multaneously. Before analysis, the Faraday cups are
calibrated for baseline and gain, and the ICs for their
yield. To ensure the optimal operating voltage and the
same sensitivity for the ICs, a signal of about 300,000
counts per second (cps) is successively directed into the
4 ICs using different analysing lines. We use a solution
of 206Pb for this cross-calibration. Based on the signal
response for each IC, the operating voltage of each IC
is adjusted in order to ensure measuring conditions with
the same sensitivity for all ICs used.

For standard and sample analysis, the signals are
collected in a single block with 40 cycles of 1.049 sec.
each. The laser is started and, when the signal at
the detectors has reached its maximum, the 40 cycles
are taken. A typical analysis therefore takes about 1
min and is illustrated in Figure 3. The isotopes 202Hg,
204(Pb+Hg), 206Pb and 207Pb are read in counts per sec-
ond (cps), and 235U in mV, which is transferred into
cps by multiplication by a factor of 62,500. We ap-
ply a standard-sample bracketing technique, analysing

a blank, a standard, and three samples, blank, standard,
and so on. The method accounts for the drift of the
instrument, and eliminates the need to correct for the
mass bias of individual isotopes.

DATA REDUCTION

The isotope data of the 40 analysed cycles are trans-
ferred into an in-house Excel spreadsheet for data re-
duction. The isotope ratios of the 40 cycles are evalu-
ated on a 2? standard error rejection basis. The routine
then calculates the error correlation value ? (rho) for the
206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U data. The isobaric contri-
bution of 204Hg is subtracted from the joint 204Pb/204Hg
peak by considering the analyzed 202Hg/204Hg ratio. The
spreadsheet allows to chose between three ways to deter-
mine the 202Hg/204Hg value which is applied for correc-
tion: (i) from the mean of the two bracketing blanks, (ii)
from the mean of the two bracketing (common Pb-free)
standards, or (iii) from the mean of the four. Normally,
the difference between the three determinations is mi-
nor. We consider this more favourable than applying the
natural 202Hg/204Hg ratio of 4.346, which would require
an absolutely precise cross-calibration of IC2 and IC3.
Because 235U cannot be analysed with this type of cup
configuration, the natural ratio 238U/235U of 137.88 is
used to calculate the 235U intensity.

The correction for instrumental drift and mass bias
is done by considering the two standards analysed be-
fore and after the samples, and the two blank analy-
ses run before and after the samples, respectively, af-
ter applying a blank correction for all isotopes analysed.
The normalization of the isotopic ratios of the samples
(Rspl) follows the formula of Albarède et al. (2004):

Rspl =
Rstd × rspl

(
r1??std1 × r

?
std2

) (3)

for which Rstd is the true isotopic ratio of the standard
(207Pb/206Pb or 206Pb/238U ratios, respectively), rspl is
the analysed isotopic ratio of the sample, and rstd1 and
rstd2 are the analysed isotopic ratios of the two standards
before and after the samples along the sequence. The
variable ? (theta) is a time factor (Albarède et al. 2004)
or, in other words, gives respective weight to the two
standard measurements. It depends on the location of
the samples within the analysing sequence, and takes
values between 0 and 1. For example, three successive
analyses run between two standards and two blanks sug-
gest ? = 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 for samples 1, 2 and 3,
respectively. The term

(
r1??std1 × r

?
std2

)
is a linear inter-

polation of the logarithms of the isotopic ratios, which
accounts for the generally exponential instrumental drift.
The same algorithm is applied to correct for the drift in
the blank analyses. An alternative would be to inject
a diluted thallium (Tl) solution to determine the mass
bias of the Pb isotopes (e.g., Horn et al. 2000) which,
however, does not allow the correction of U mass bias.
The standard-sample bracketing approach applied here,
therefore, certainly bears the least error for that analyt-
ical method, as it does not require intensive mass bias
corrections.

The corrected 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/206Pb ratios so
obtained are transferred into absolute age information

external reproducibility (2 SD?2analysed) is represented by
the standard deviation obtained by repeated analysis of
standard zircon GJ-1 which were run during the analyti-
cal session (generally ?0.8% for 207Pb/206Pb, and ?1%
for 206Pb/238U). The within-run precision (2 SE?2analysed)
is the standard error calculated for each analysis. The
resulting errors are 2? standard deviations.

Zircon U-Pb isotopic analyses may require a correc-
tion for the common lead contribution to the total 206Pb
and 207Pb signals. There are a couple of methods to do
this in the literature (see Andersen 2002, Horstwood et

al. 2003). For minerals with a low common Pb content
as, for example, zircon, we use a correction based on the
amount of non-radiogenic 204Pb. The counts per second
of 204Pb (including a correction for 204Hg) are used to
deduce the amount of non-radiogenic, common 206Pb
and 207Pb, given a common Pb composition following
the model of Stacey and Kramers (1975). With the frac-
tion fc of common

206Pb and 207Pb so obtained:

where Pbc is the value (in counts per second) of common
Pb, Pbt the total Pb, and Pbr the radiogenic Pb, with Pb
being 206Pb or 207Pb, respectively, we use the relation-

of Andersen (2002) to arrive at common Pb-corrected
206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U isotopic ratios. The neces-
sity for a correction is judged from the 204Pb signal in-
tensity. Values smaller than ? 25 cps (blank-corrected),
resulting in 206Pb/204Pb ratios well beyond 3000, sug-
gest an insignificant common Pb content which would
not recognizably effect the calculated ages. All zircons
analysed in this study met this condition, and therefore
did not require a correction.

STANDARDS AND SAMPLES

Three international zircon standards were analysed, us-
ing each one as an external standard and correcting the
remaining two against it. This yields a set of 6 iso-
tope ratio and age data which are compared with the
certified values of the standards (see Table I). The stan-
dards are: (i) GJ-1 zircon standard provided by the ARC
National Key Centre for Geochemical Evolution and
Metallogeny of Continents (GEMOC), Australia. This is
a gem-quality zircon crystal of about 0.7 cm in diameter
which was broken and prepared for analysis. Its refer-
ence age after Jackson et al. (2004) is: 207Pb/206Pb age
= 608.6 ± 1.1 Ma, 206Pb/238U age = 600.4 ± 1.8 Ma,
207Pb/235U age = 602.1 ± 3.0 Ma; (ii) Temora 2, pro-
vided by Lance Black, Geoscience Australia, Australia,
which comes from the Middledale gabbroic diorite in
eastern Australia; the zircon crystals have a size of about
300–500 ?m and, prior to sample preparation, the con-
centrate was hand-picked to obtain a high-purity zircon
concentrate. Its reference age after Black et al. (2004)
is: 207Pb/206Pb age = 419.1 ± 9.1 Ma, 206Pb/238U age
= 416.2 ± 1.1 Ma, 207Pb/235U age = 416.7 ± 1.7 Ma;
(iii) FC1 zircon concentrate provided by Richard Arm-
strong, Australian National University, Canberra, Aus-
tralia; the crystals have sizes of approximately 50–
100?m, and were hand-picked prior to sample prepara-
tion; they were extracted from the Duluth Complex in
the U.S.A. Its reference age (Paces and Miller 1993)
is: 207Pb/206Pb age = 1098.9 Ma, 206Pb/238U age =
1099.9 Ma, 207Pb/235U age = 1100.0 Ma.

For an additional test of the method, two zircon
samples from our own laboratory which had previously
been dated by other analytical methods were also investi-
gated here. One is a relatively young zircon concentrate
(sample HD66) from a hornblende-bearing orthogneiss

of the Neoproterozoic Goiás magmatic arc which has
previously been dated at 630 ± 5 Ma (2? ) by U-Pb ID-
TIMS in our laboratory (Laux et al. 2005). Its average
207Pb/206Pb TIMS age is 633.3±5.7 Ma. The other sam-
ple (EC69A) has much older zircon crystals and went
through a more complex geological history. They were
extracted from a migmatized hornblende- and biotite-
bearing tonalite from an Archean nucleus of the São
José do Campestre Massif in the Borborema Province,
NE Brazil. The zircons yielded an upper intercept age
of 3065 ± 12 Ma determined by SHRIMP analysis
(Dantas et al. unpublished data).

RESULTS

Between 13 and 23 analyses were run for the standards
GJ1, Temora 2 and FC1. Figure 4 shows the ages ob-
tained for each standard normalized against one another
in a Concordia diagram, and Table I summarizes the data
obtained. The concordance between the values obtained
and the referenced standard data of the 207Pb/206Pb,
206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U age data is well satisfactory.
We obtained precisions of 1.9 to 3.7% (2? standard de-
viation) for the 207Pb/206Pb, 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U
age data, depending on the isotope system and on the
particular standard. The accuracy was calculated as the
percentage of deviation between the analysed Concor-
dia age and the referenced 207Pb/206Pb age. The Concor-
dia age, following Ludwig (2003) is, “the most-probable
age for a data-point (or weighted-mean data-point) on a
Concordia diagram, where the true location of the data
point is assumed to fall precisely on the Concordia
curve”. Because not all referenced standards provide
the error correlation coefficient to calculate that age,
their referenced 207Pb/206Pb age was used. The accu-
racy so obtained varies between 0.6 and 3.8% (2? stan-
dard deviation).

The majority of the 23 analyses obtained for the
natural sample HD66 (Table II) were taken as multi-
ple analyses on different localities of individual grains.
They are all concordant (Fig. 5), yielding a Concordia
age of 627.6 ± 1.3 Ma, which is identical within er-
ror to the TIMS age of 630 ± 5 Ma. None of the zir-
cons required a common Pb correction. The 204Hg-cor-
rected 204Pb signal was 30 cps at most, yielding calcu-
lated 206Pb/204Pb ratios between 3000 and 50000. The

weighted average of 24 207Pb/206Pb ages resulted in a
207Pb/206Pb age of 628.7 ± 6.0 Ma, compared with
the TIMS 207Pb/206Pb age of 633.3 ± 5.7 Ma.

Sample EC69A shows a more complex zircon pop-
ulation, as seen from 24 SHRIMP (Table III) and 35
LA-ICP-MS analyses (Table IV). Most of the LA-ICP-
MS analyses were taken as multiple shots on individ-
ual zircon grains. None of the zircons required a com-
mon Pb correction. The ICP-MS analyses display var-
ious groups of zircons plotting on supposedly different
Discordia lines (Fig. 6). The youngest upper intercept
age, defined by four discordant and three concordant
analytical points, yields the age of 3045 ± 24 Ma,
which agrees within error with the SHRIMP age of
3065 ± 12 Ma. However, various older zircon popu-
lations were encountered in the sample. One is defined
by 17 discordant zircon analyses which yield an upper
intercept age of 3305 ± 51 Ma. A minor population
composed of three discordant analyses gives an upper
intercept age of 3625 ± 38 Ma. The two latter pop-

ulations may relate to 3.4–3.5 Ga ages reported from
the same area by Dantas et al. (2004). Another group
of five highly discordant zircon analyses with extremely
low 206Pb/238U ratios may represent still another, even
older geological event. Three analyses on grain 14 (see
Table IV, but not included in Fig. 6) yielded one con-
cordant and two nearly concordant data with ages be-
tween 540 and 570 Ma. They represent another event
of resetting of the isotope system during the Neopro-
terozoic/Cambrian Brasiliano cycle. Therefore, the Dis-
cordias of all older zircon populations were anchored to
558 Ma, which is the mean of these three analyses.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

A comparison of the LA-ICP-MS results of the natural
sample HD66 with TIMS analyses shows a fine confor-
mity even within the limits of error, yielding 627.6 ±
1.3 Ma for LA-ICP-MS and 630 ± 5 Ma for the TIMS
analyses. Moreover, the LA-ICP-MS analyses indicate

that there was no Pb loss in the zircons (no discordant
zircons), in contrast to three out of four TIMS analy-
ses (Fig. 5a). It is most probable, that weathered or
otherwise isotopically disturbed surfaces of the zircons
are responsible for the discordant U-Pb TIMS data,
since the zircons were not abraded before digestion to
remove possible alterations or disturbances. The LA-
ICP-MS method avoids this by polishing of the zircon
grains before analysis, and by a laser pre-ablation which
cleans the uppermost part of the mineral surface.

The LA-ICP-MS analyses of the natural sample
EC69A show a complex history of zircon growth and
lead loss. Three concordant zircon analyses, together
with 4 other analyses, define an upper intercept age of
3045 ± 24 Ma (Fig. 6) which agrees, within error, with
the 3065 ± 12 Ma SHRIMP age. There are other discor-

dant zircon analyses which, although being discordant,
indicate a complex history of crystallization and partial
resetting. In that particular case, the internal structure
of the zircons would have to be imaged by cathodolu-
minescence or back-scattered electron techniques prior
to analysis, for ensuring an unequivocal interpretation
of the various age populations. The analyses presented
here show, nevertheless, that it is possible to detect an
even complex geological history from a set of only 10–
15 zircon grains, by high spatial resolution LA-ICP-MS
analysis.

The LA-MC-ICP-MS method presented here is
designed for rapid analysis of large sample sets, which
often are needed in sediment provenance or other re-
gional geological studies. It overcomes extensive sample
preparation and careful wet chemical isotope separation,

for the 207Pb/206Pb, 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U isotopic

RESUMO

A determinação de idades através do decaimento dos isóto-

pos radioativos 235U e 238U para os isótopos radiogênicos
207Pb e 206Pb, respectivamente, utilizando o mineral zircão

(ZrSiO4), é amplamente aplicada para decifrar processos geo-

lógicos. Um novo método tem sido desenvolvido nos últimos

anos, a ablação a laser multi-coletor espectrometria de massas

com plasma indutivamente acoplado (LA-MC-ICP-MS), su-

perando o laborioso trabalho anteriormente necessário em ou-

tros métodos, na preparação de amostras, e permite obtenção

de razões isotópicas com alta resolução espacial de micrôme-

tros. O presente estudo descreve os procedimentos analíticos e

os métodos usados na redução de dados que estão sendo apli-

cados no Laboratório de Geocronologia da Universidade de

Brasília. Explora-se a precisão e exatidão do método através

da análise de três padrões internacionais de zircão. Observa-

se uma precisão entre 1,9 a 3,7% (2? desvio padrão) e uma

exatidão de 0,6 a 3,8% (2? desvio padrão) para as razões

isotópicas de Pb e U dos padrões. Também foram obtidas

idades pelo método LA-ICP-MS de duas amostras de zircões

naturais, que já foram datadas anteriormente por outros méto-

dos analíticos. A comparação dos resultados mostra uma boa

conformidade das idades obtidas, dentro dos limites de erro.

Os dados demonstram o grande potencial do método analítico

para análises isotópicas rápidas, precisas e exatas de U-Pb,

numa escala de micrômetros.
