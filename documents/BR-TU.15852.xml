ABSTRACT

A review of published papers and results of analysis of new material have allowed improvements on the

palynostratigraphy of the Permian strata of the Paraná Basin in Rio Grande do Sul State. Based on first and

last occurrences of certain species of pollen taxa, two palynozones are formalized, these are the Vittatina

costabilis and Lueckisporites virkkiae Interval Zones, in ascending order. The Vittatina costabilis Interval

Zone is subdivided into two units, in ascending order the Protohaploxypinus goraiensis and the Hamiapol-

lenites karrooensis Subzones, and is recognized from the glacial (Itararé Group) and post-glacial sequence

(Rio Bonito Formation and the base of the Palermo Formation). The Lueckisporites virkkiae Interval Zone

occurs from the uppermost Rio Bonito Formation, through the Palermo and Irati formations, and into the

Serra Alta and Teresina formations. The main characteristics and reference sections are established, as well

as additional criteria to recognize biostratigraphical units, in accordance with the International Stratigraphic

Guide. Palynostratigraphical correlation suggests that the Vittatina costabilis Zone concerns the Early Per-

mian (early Cisuralian), while the Lueckisporites virkkiae is regarded as late Early Permian to early Middle

Permian (late Cisularian to early Guadalupian).

Key words: Palynology, Permian, Paraná Basin, biostratigraphy, Rio Grande do Sul.

INTRODUCTION

Palynology is an important tool in solving geo-

logical problems, providing information on paleo-

climatology, paleobiogeography and palaeoenviron-

ments. However, biostratigraphy and correlation are

its primary applications. In particular, palynology is

valuable since it allows correlations between terres-

trial and marine deposits (Christopher and Goodman

1996), because palynomorphs are commonly found

in both marine and nonmarine strata.

The Upper Paleozoic strata of the Paraná

Basin bear diverse and abundant fossils, including

invertebrates, vertebrates, plant remains and paly-

nomorphs. However, correlateable horizons and in-

dependently dated fossils, such as marine inverte-

brates are scarce, preventing precise correlation and

accurate age calibration. In this context, palynolog-

ical assemblages are commonly used, contributing

to correlation and characterization of depositional

environments.

Previous palynological papers for the Paraná

Basin are known since the ending of the 1960s,

contributing to taxonomy and preliminary zonation

schemes. The most important of these papers are

Daemon and Quadros (1970) and Marques-Toigo

(1991). Further studies were made improving the

stratigraphical and the palynological knowledge of

the Paraná Basin (e.g. Souza and Marques-Toigo

2001).

New palynological data have recently been ob-

tained, allowing palynostratigraphic improvements.

This contribution deals exclusively with the Late

Paleozoic palynostratigraphy in Rio Grande do Sul

State (RS), in the South of Brazilian Paraná Basin.

Formal biostratigraphical units are proposed, named

and described, detailing the previous proposal of

Marques-Toigo (1991), in accordance with the In-

ternational Stratigraphic Guide, as well as adding

new data obtained from recent studies.

GEOLOGICAL SYNOPSIS

The Paraná Basin is a large intracratonic basin,

located at the central-eastern part of the South-

American Platform. It was formed in response to

the geological stabilization after the Braziliano

Cycle (Upper Proterozoic/early Early Paleozoic).

This basin comprises a thick and extensive sedi-

mentary-magmatic sequence, which covers an area

of about 1,700,000 km2, situated in Brazil, Uruguay,

Argentina and Paraguay, reaching thicknesses of

ca. 5,000 m. Its geological units, Late Ordovician

to the Upper Cretaceous in age, are the following:

Rio Ivaí Group (Ordovician-Silurian), Paraná Group

(Devonian), Tubarão Supergroup (Carboniferous-

Permian), Passa Dois Group (Permian), São Bento

Group (Jurassic-Cretaceous) and Bauru Group (Cre-

taceous) (Milani et al. 1994).

The Rio Grande do Sul Upper Paleozoic and

Triassic units are shown in Figure 1. The main

palyniferous beds are the Itararé Group, and the

Rio Bonito, Palermo and Irati formations. Palyno-

morphs are scarce, or absent from the upper units.

Holz (1998) recognized four third-order depo-

sitional sequences within the Tubarão Supergroup

(Itararé Group, Rio Bonito and Palermo formations)

and in the base of the Passa Dois Group (Irati For-

mation) in RS. According to this author, Sequence I

(Itararé Group) is a pro-glacial turbiditic facies of a

lowstand systems tract, which is overlain by mud-

stones that represent a major flooding event. Se-

quence II (Rio Bonito Formation) is a trangressive

system tract represented by fluviodeltaic, floodplain,

barrier/lagoon, shoreface with supratidal facies. Se-

quence III (upper Rio Bonito, Palermo and lower

Irati formations) comprises inter- and supratidal de-

posits, and facies related to an epicontinental sea.

Sequence IV occurs within the Irati Formation, and

is related to restricted marine conditions.

PREVIOUS PALYNOSTRATIGRAPHY

Palynological zonations of different scales and

based on different biostratigraphic concepts have

been proposed for the Upper Paleozoic of the Paraná

Basin. The scheme proposed by Daemon and Qua-

dros (1970) is the most complete. These authors

proposed six interval zones with subzones, named

as G, H (H1, H2, H3), I (I1, I2+I3+I4), J, K and

L (L1, L2, L3), in ascending order, based on the dis-

tribution of forty pollen taxa. Monosaccate pollen

grains dominate the G, H1 and H2 intervals, includ-

ing Cannanoropollis, Plicatipollenites, Potonieis-

porites and Caheniasaccites; a taeniate disaccate

pollen grain also occurs (Protohaploxypinus). From

the H3 subinterval up to the I interval, Proto-

haploxypinus, Vittatina and Illinites become domi-

nant. The J, K and L intervals are marked by the

abundance and diversity of taeniate and polyplicate

pollen grains, mainly Vittatina and Lueckisporites.

Subsequent papers have improved the knowl-

edge on the stratigraphical distribution of certain

taxa. According to Daemon and Quadros (1970),

Plicatipollenites trigonalis (= ‘‘P-490’’) and Can-

nanoropollis triangularis (= ‘‘P-501’’) are strati-

graphically restricted to the G Interval. However,

Dias (1993) recorded these species in the Itararé

Subgroup in the RS, which is, according to Dae-

mon and Quadros (1970), related to the H3 subin-

terval. Plicatipollenites gondwanensis (P-906) has

been recorded at the base of the Itararé Group, that

is related to the G-H intervals (Souza et al. 2003),

but according to Daemon and Quadros (1970) it is

restricted to the I and K intervals.

A significant contribution has come from Mar-

ques-Toigo (1991), who detailed and formalized

the palynostratigraphical succession recorded in

the southern portion of the Paraná Basin, involving

the Tubarão Supergroup and the lower Passa Dois

Group (Irati Formation) in the RS and the State

of Santa Catarina. The zones were named as the

Cannanoropollis korbaensis Biozone and the Lueck-

isporites virkkiae Biozone, in ascending order. The

former was subdivided into three subzones: the Pro-

tohaploxypinus goraiensis Subzone, the Cahenia-

saccites ovatus Subzone and the Hamiapollenites

karrooensis Subzone. According to Marques-Toigo

(1991), these subzones correlate with the H3-J in-

tervals of Daemon and Quadros (1970), while the

Lueckisporites virkkiae Zone correlates with the K

and L intervals.

During the past two decades, data collected

from the north-eastern portion of the basin have re-

sulted in new palynostratigraphical zonations (un-

published data). Some of these results were pre-

liminarily presented by Souza and Marques-Toigo

(2001, 2003), who summarized the palynological

succession of the Upper Paleozoic of the Brazilian

Paraná Basin.

According to Souza and Marques-Toigo (2001,

2003), four interval zones characterize the Upper

Paleozoic of the Paraná Basin: Ahrensisporites cris-

tatus, Crucisaccites monoletus, Vittatina costabilis

and Lueckisporites virkkiae, in stratigraphical order.

The first two are restricted to the northeastern por-

tion of the Paraná Basin, being Carboniferous in

age (Westphalian/Stephanian) and correlate, in part,

with the G-H2 intervals. The Vittatina costabilis

and Lueckisporites virkkiae interval zones are rec-

ognized along to the Basin and are focused herein.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This study is based on review of published papers,

mainly Marques-Toigo (1991), and reanalysis of

slides housed in the Laboratório de Palinologia of

the Instituto de Geociências, Universidade Federal

do Rio Grande do Sul, as well as of new material.

A detailed taxonomic re-examination was held to

check the ranges of the species that were previously

thought as diagnostic of some units and stratigraph-

ical intervals. Furthermore, new palynological as-

semblages were obtained from surface and subsur-

face samples.

Analysis of the stratigraphical distribution was

mainly based on wells related to coal research and

exploration, as follows: 2-TG-69-RS well (drilled

in the locality of Santa Terezinha Coal), 5-CA-03-

RS, 5-CA-41-RS (Charqueadas Coal), 5-CA-91-RS

(Gravataí-Morungava Coal), 2-TG-88-RS (Chico

Lomã Coal), P7 (Iruí Coal) and N3 (Santa Rita

Coal). These wells were drilled by the Compa-

nhia Riograndense de Mineração (CRM) and by the

Companhia de Pesquisas de Recursos Minerais

(CPRM). Geological and palynological data from

these wells were published by Marques-Toigo and

Pons (1974), Bortoluzzi et al. (1980), Marques-

Toigo et al. (1982, 1984) and Picarelli et al. (1987).

PALYNOSTRATIGRAPHY

The palynozones erected herein correspond to in-
terval biozones. They have been established in ac-
cordance to the criteria of the International Subcom-
mission on Stratigraphic Classification of IUGS, and
summarized by Murphy and Salvador (1999), as
commonly applied to palynological units (Christo-
pher and Goodman 1996). Selected taxa of the two
palynozones are illustrated in the Figures 2 and 3,
including main diagnostic taxa and other taxa com-
mon in the biozones (e.g. Punctatisporites greten-
sis, Lundbladispora braziliensis and Vittatina sub-
saccata). Table I gives the full author citation of the
taxa referred to in this paper.

Vittatina costabilis Interval Zone

General characteristics

The most common palynomorphs of this biozone
are bilaterally and radially symmetrical monosac-
cate pollen, such as Cannanoropollis, Plicatipol-
lenites, Caheniasaccites, Potonieisporites and Strio-
monosaccites, reaching up to 50-60% of assembla-
ges. Disaccate pollen grains are dominant in the
upper portion of this zone (the Hamiapollenites kar-
rooensis Subzone) and common taxa are Limitispo-
rites, Vittatina, Scheuringipollenites and Protohap-
loxypinus. Spores are locally dominant, reaching
up to 80% in coal beds, reflecting the local flora and
suggesting parautochtonous conditions.

In several wells, the genus Vittatina occurs in
the basal portion of this zone, demonstrating a wide
geographical distribution. Furthermore, it is repre-
sented by considerable species, e.g. Vittatina costa-
bilis, V. saccata, V. subsaccata, V. vittifera, V. cor-
rugata and V. wodehousei. Among these species,
Vittatina costabilis has been chosen to name the
biozone because it is easily recognizable and very
abundant, although it also occurs in the subsequent
biozone. This last detail does not prevent its use in

an interval biozone (see Murphy and Salvador 1999,
p. 263).

Limits

The lower limit of this zone is marked by the first
appearance of the genus Vittatina (V. saccata, V. sub-
saccata, V. costabilis, V. vittifera), species of Pro-
tohaploxypinus (P. goraiensis, P. limpidus), Fusa-
colpites fusus and Illinites unicus. This is commonly
within the upper Itararé Group. The upper limit is
marked by the appearance of diagnostic species of
the Lueckisporites virkkiae Interval Zone. The up-
per limit commonly occurs within the uppermost
Rio Bonito Formation and lowermost Palermo For-
mation.

Subzones

This palynozone is divided in two units, the Proto-

haploxypinus goraiensis and Hamiapollenites kar-

rooensis subzones. The first is defined by the range

of Protohaploxypinus goraiensis, Illinites unicus,

and Protohaploxypinus limpidus. The Hamiapol-

lenites karrooensis Subzone is defined by the range

of the eponymous species; its base is additionally de-

fined by the first appearance of Striatopodocarpites

fusus and Staurosaccites cordubensis.

The Caheniasaccites ovatus Subzone of Mar-

ques-Toigo (1991) is regarded as part of the Proto-

haploxypinus goraiensis Subzone. The lower limit

of the former was defined by the last appearance of

Protohaploxypinus goraiensis, and the upper limit

by the disappearance of Cahenisaccites flavatus

(= Caheniasaccites ovatus). However, according

to Cazzulo-Klepzig (personal communication), Pro-

tohaploxypinus goraiensis occurs in the Candiota

Coal, which was considered to belong to the Cahe-

niasaccites ovatus Subzone (Cazzulo-Klepzig et al.

2002). Besides, Caheniasaccites flavatus has a large

range in the Paraná Basin, from the Itararé Group

to the Palermo Formation (see Souza et al. 2003).

Thus, the limits of the Caheniasaccites ovatus Sub-

zone of Marques-Toigo (1991) could not be marked

as proposed. Among its stratigraphically restricted

species (according Marques-Toigo 1991), Horrid-

itriletes pathakheraensis and Anguisporites ornatus

are very rare in the sequence and Scheuringipollen-

ites maximus has been recorded in the middle-upper

portion of the Itararé Group, within the Crucisac-

cites monoletus Zone (Souza and Marques-Toigo

2003).

Reference section

The interval between 535 and 500 m depth in the

2-TG-69-RS well (Santa Terezinha Coal), in Osório

Municipality, is the reference section for this bio-

zone. Geological data on this sequence are given by

Picarelli et al. (1987, p. 364). The palynozone is

also identified in several wells in RS, such as 2-TG-

99-RS (ca. 645 to 580 m in depth) and P7 (ca. 345 to

320 m in depth; see Marques-Toigo and Pons 1974,

Picarelli et al. 1987).

Lueckisporites virkkiae Interval Zone

General characteristics

Pollen taxa which appear from its lower limits and

species of Protohaploxypinus, Striatopodocarpites,

Striatoabieites, Lunatisporites and Marsupipollen-

ites, are dominant in this biozone. Monosaccate

and disaccate pollen grains (Potonieisporites, Limi-

tisporites) are less common. Spores are scarce, and

two new species appear within this zone, these are

Thymospora criciumensis and Convolutispora pin-

toi, from levels within the Palermo and the Irati for-

mations, respectively.

Lueckisporites virkkiae is morphologically eas-

ily recognizable and seems to have a stratigraphi-

cally consistent first appearance in the Paraná Basin,

from the base of the K interval of Daemon and Qua-

dros (1970), that is considered a datum in the Paraná

Basin, from the RS (southmost portion of the Brazil-

ian Paraná Basin) to the State of Mato Grosso (north-

most portion).

Limits

The lower limit of this zone is defined by the last ap-

pearance of Hamiapollenites karrooensis and Stel-

lapollenites talchirensis and by the first appearance

crocorpus, Lunatisporites variesectus, Alisporites

nuthallensis and Striatopodocarpites pantii, within

the uppermost Rio Bonito Formation and lowermost

Palermo Formation. Its upper limit is marked by the

disappearance of species of Lueckisporites, within

levels of the Serra Alta and Teresina formations.

Reference section

The reference section is the interval between 168.5 m

and 118.65 m in the 5-CA-41-RS well from levels of

siltstone of the Irati Formation. Diagnostic species

of this biozone (e.g. Lueckisporites virkkiae, L.

stenotaeniatus, Weylandites lucifer) occur in subsur-

face, in the wells 5-CA-74-RS, 5-CA-03-RS (Char-

queadas Coal), P7 (Iruí Coal), 2-TG-69-RS and 2-

TG-99-RS (Santana Terezinha Coal), as well as in

outcrops (Dellazzana 1976, Menéndez 1976, Pica-

relli et al. 1987).

Ranges of selected species are shown in Fig-

ure 4, which summarizes the zonation proposed

herein, as well as the ages adopted.

DISCUSSION

Palynological Correlation

Within the Paraná Basin, the Vittatina costabilis In-

terval Zone can be correlated with the H3-J Interval

of Daemon and Quadros (1970). The appearance

of Striatopodocarpites fusus (= ‘‘P360’’ in Daemon

and Quadros 1970) suggests correlation to the Hami-

apollenites karrooensis Subzone with the J interval.

The Lueckisporites virkkiae Interval Zone is related

pollen grains and are well established in the Paraná

Basin.

Tentative correlations with palynological zona-

tions from the Upper Paleozoic of South America

could be established. The Vittatina costabilis Zone

shares common elements with the Potonieispori-

tes-Lundbladispora Zone and Cristatisporites Zone

of the Chacoparanense Basin of Argentina (Vergel

1993), such as Vittatina subsaccata and Protoha-

ploxypinus limpidus. However, the appearance of

the genus Vittatina, that is regarded as a basal marker

of the Vittatina costabilis Zone in the Paraná Basin,

occurs from the Potonieisporites-Lundbladispora

Zone, where it is rare.

Similar problems are verified when compar-

ing the Lueckisporites virkkiae Zone and the Stri-

atites Zone of the Chacoparanense Basin. However,

Lueckisporites virkkiae, Lunatisporites variesectus

and Marsupipollenites striatus (wrongly referred to

as M. triradiatus in the chart 1 of Souza and Mar-

ques-Toigo 2003) mark the lower limit of these last

two zones and could characterize a biohorizon of

correlation.

Considering the zonation of the Central-

Western Argentina proposed by Césari and Gutiérrez

(2000), the Vittatina costabilis Zone seems to corre-

late to the Fusacolpites fusus-Vittatina subsaccata

Interval Biozone, with Vittatina subsaccata, Pro-

tohaploxypinus limpidus and Hamiapollenites fusi-

formis as common species. The Lueckisporites virk-

kiae Interval Zone correlates to the Lueckisporites-

Weylandites Assemblage Biozone, taking into ac-

count the distribution of Lueckisporites and Weylan-

dites lucifer.

Assemblages with common species and sim-

ilar quantitative features have been recognized in

Africa (e.g. Falcon 1975), Antarctica (e.g. Linds-

tröm 1995, 1996), Australia (e.g. Jones and Trus-

well 1992), Oman and Saudi Arabia (e.g. Stephen-

son and Filatoff 2000). However, correlations are

not precise. As an example, spores species that are

stratigraphically restricted to the basal portion of

the Upper Paleozoic sequence in the Paraná Basin

(Itararé Group), such as Ahrensisporites cristatus

and Psomospora detecta, show a long stratigraphic

range in Australian basins (see Jones and Truswell

1992), preventing long distance correlations. Paly-

nological differences between the microfloras can

be explained by phytogeographic distribution.

Age

The main problems of the palynological Gondwana

correlation with the international stratigraphi-

cal stages were recently discussed by Stephenson et

al. (2003, p. 471-472) and are related to palaeo-

phytogeographical variations, different criteria used

to established zones and correlations, as well as lit-

tle radiometrical data. Correlation with the marine

Permian stages is difficult and speculative.

Only one absolute age is available for the Upper

Paleozoic of the RS. Matos et al. (2001) obtained a

date of 267.1 ± 3.4 (U/Pb) from a tonstein interbed-
ded in the upper coal seam of Candiota Coal (Rio

Bonito Formation), within the Caheniasaccites ova-

tus Subzone (Cazzulo-Klepzig et al. 2002). This

coal bed is regarded herein within the Protohap-

loxypinus goraiensis Subzone.

Melchor (2000) indicated a probable minimum

absolute age for the base of the Striatites Biozone

(Chacoparanense Basin) in Argentina as 266.3 ±
0.82, based on the Ar/Ar method. This zone may

correlate to the Lueckisporites virkkiae Zone, taking

into account the first appearance of Lueckisporites

as a biohorizon.

An absolute age of 270 My was obtained

from tuff beds of the Collingham Formation, in

Namibia (Stollhofen et al. 2000). This unit overlies

the Whitehill Formation, which is correlated to the

Irati Formation (Faure and Cole 1999), in Paraná

Basin, and is related to the Lueckisporites virkkiae

Interval Zone. Considering that there is no consid-

erable diachronism between these two lithostrati-

graphical units, the Irati Formation should be re-

garded as older than 270 My. This dating disagrees

with those established by Melchor (2000) and Matos

et al. (2001) that come from stratigraphically lower

sections.

Because of this and considering the changes on

geochronologic positioning that have been brought

on by the recently introduced formal Permian sub-

division (Jin et al. 1997 and the IUGS chart), this

work has adopted the traditional standards for both

units. Vittatina costabilis Zone is regarded as Early

Permian (early Cisuralian), while the Lueckisporites

virkkiae is regarded as late Early Permian to early

Middle Permian (late Cisularian to early Guadalu-

pian). The suggested age for the Vittatina costabilis

Zone is based on previous palynological and pale-

obotanical data (e.g. Daemon and Quadros 1970,

Rösler 1978) as well as on radiometrical data ob-

tained from correlative Fusacolpites fusus-Vittatina

subsaccata Interval Zone of Argentina (Césari and

Gutiérrez 2000, p. 134).

RESUMO

Com base na distribuição de grãos de pólen, duas

unidades palinobioestratigráficas são formalisadas para o

Permiano da Bacia do Paraná no Rio Grande do Sul. As

unidades correspondem, da base para o topo, às zonas

de intervalo Vittatina costabilis e Lueckisporites virkkiae,

sendo a primeira subdividida em duas subzonas: Pro-

tohaploxypinus goraiensis e Hamiapollenites karrooen-

sis. A primeira zona é considerada eopermiana (Eo a

Mesocisuraliano), tendo sido detectada junto à seqüência

glacial e pós-glacial referente ao Grupo Itararé e Formação

Rio Bonito, abrangendo ainda porções inferiores da For-

mação Palermo. A Zona Lueckisporites virkkiae, consi-

derada neo-eopermiana a mesopermiana (neocisuraliana

a eoguadalupiana), ocorre nas formações Palermo e Irati,

podendo ainda ser estendida a estratos mais superiores da

bacia (formações Serra Alta e Teresina). Suas principais

características e seções de referência são apresentadas,

bem como outros critérios requeridos pelo Código Estrati-

gráfico Internacional na proposição de unidades bioes-

tratigráficas.
