ABSTRACT: The Brasília Belt is one of the most complete Neo-
proterozoic orogens in western Gondwana. Rapid progress on the 
understanding of the tectonic evolution of the belt was achieved 
due to new U-Pb data, combined with Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf analyses. 
The  evolution of the Brasília orogen happened over a long period 
of time (900 – 600 Ma) involving subduction, magmatism and ter-
rain accretion, as a result of the consumption of the Goiás oceanic 
lithosphere. Provenance studies, based on U-Pb zircon data, indica-
te that the sedimentary rock units record different tectonic settings 
and stages of the evolution of the orogen. The Paranoá and Canastra 
groups represent passive margin sequences derived from the erosion 
of the São Francisco Craton. The Araxá and Ibiá groups, however, 
have dominant Neoproterozoic detrital zircon populations, as  young 
as 650 Ma, suggesting derivation from the Goiás Magmatic Arc. The 
Goiás Magmatic Arc represents a composite arc terrain, formed by 
the accretion of older (ca. 0.9 – 0.8 Ga) intraoceanic island arc(s), 
followed by more evolved continental arcs. It extends for several 
thousand kilometers, from SW Goiás, through NE Brazil and into 
Africa. Metamorphism took place between 650 – 630 Ma reflecting 
final closure of the Goiás Ocean and continental collision.

RESUMO: A Faixa Brasília é um dos mais completos orógenos Neopro-
terozoicos no Gondwana Ocidental. Durante os últimos dez anos, o rápido 
progresso no entendimento da evolução tectônica desse orógeno foi propor-
cionado pela produção de novos dados geocronológicos U-Pb SHRIMP e 
LA-ICPMS, combinados com análises Sm-Nd e Lu-Hf. Os dados demon-
straram que a evolução da Faixa Brasília acontenceu ao longo de um 
prolongado intervalo de tempo (900 – 600 Ma), envolvendo subducção, 
atividade ígnea e acreção de terrenos, como resultado do consumo da li-
tosfera do oceano Goiás. Estudos de proveniência de sedimentos baseados 
em geocronologia U-Pb de minerais detríticos indicam que as unidades 
sedimentares da Faixa Brasília também registram diferentes ambientes 
tectônicos e estágios de evolução da Faixa. Os grupos Paranoá e Canastra 
representam sequências de margem passiva, derivadas da erosão do Craton 
do São Francisco. Por outro lado, as rochas sedimentares dos grupos Araxá 
e Ibiá contêm uma grande quantidade de zircões detríticos neoproterozo-
icos, tão jovens quanto 650 Ma, sugerindo proveniência a partir do Arco 
Magmático de Goiás. Os dados geocronológicos disponíveis até o momento 
demonstram que o Arco Magmático de Goiás, na porção oeste do orógeno, 
representa um terreno de arco formado pela acreção de arcos de ilha in-
traoceânicos mais antigos (ca. 0.9 – 0.8 Ga), seguida do desenvolvimento 
de arcos continentais mais evoluídos. O arco magmático se extende por 
alguns milhares de quilômetros na direção NNE, desde o sudoeste de Goiás, 
através do Nordeste brasileiro, se prolongando para o continente africano. 
Idades de metamorfismo, muito embora não muito abundantes, indicam 
pico do metamorfismo entre 650 – 630 Ma, o que provavelmente corre-
sponde à época de fechamento do oceano e colisão continental.

INTRODUCTION

The Brasília Belt, in central Brazil, is one of the most 
complete and complex Neoproterozoic orogens in western 
Gondwana. It formed during the convergence of the Amazonian, 
São Francisco-Congo, Paranapanema (Rio de La Plata), as well 
as smaller allochthonous blocks (Fig. 1). It is part of a wide and 
long orogenic system extending for thousands of kilometers in 
central and northern Brazil and in NW Africa, in the Hoggar-
Pharusian and Dahomey belts. In Brazil, this orogenic area is 
known as the Tocantins Province, which includes the Brasília 
Belt, developed along the western margin of the São Francisco 
Craton, as well as the Araguaia and Paraguay belts, formed 
along the continental margin of the Amazonian paleoconti-
nent. They are all part of the amalgamation of West Gondwana 
during the neoproterozoic and eocambrian.

Over the last ten years, a considerable amount of new 
U-Pb and Sm-Nd geochronological data has been instru-
mental to understand in greater detail the tectonic evolution 
of the Brasília Belt. It has been suggested in the literature 
that the tectonic elements and geochronological data for the 
Brasília Belt record a long and complex history of deforma-
tion, metamorphism and accretion of terranes, including 
island arc terranes, an ophiolitic mélange, high-grade ter-
rains and a supracrustal fold-and-thrust belt, consisting of 
juxtaposed metasedimentary sequences of various ages and 
natures (for recent reviews see Pimentel et al. 2011, Araujo 
et al. 2014, Cordani et al. 2013a, 2013b, Brito Neves et al. 
2014, Brito Neves &amp;amp; Fuck 2014). 

In the present study, the tectonic evolution of the Brasília 
Belt was discussed mainly on the light of ID-TIMS, ion 
microprobe and LA-ICPMS U-Pb geochronological data 
published mostly over the last ten years. Some key tectonic 
units will be highlighted:

 ? the supracrustal sequences of the fold-and-thrust belt 
and cratonic cover,

 ? the neoproterozoic high-grade terrains (Uruaçu and 
Anápolis-Itauçu complexes),

 ? three large Neoproterozoic mafic-ultramafic complexes 
of Barro Alto, Niquelândia and Canabrava, and asso-
ciated volcano-sedimentary sequences of uncertain age,

 ? the Goiás Magmatic Arc.

GEOLOGY AND GEOCHRONOLOGY 
OF THE BRASÍLIA BELT

Goiás Archaean Block 
This is considered to be an allochthonous microplate, 

accreted to the western margin of the Brasília Belt during 

the latest stages of evolution of the Neoproterozoic orogen 
(Jost et al. 2013). It underlies an area of about 18,000 km2 
(Fig. 2) and consists of typical Archean TTG granite-gneiss 
complexes (Queiroz et al. 2008, Jost et al. 2013), and nar-
row greenstone belt sequences (Fortes et al. 1995, Tassinari 
et al. 2006, Santos et al. 2008, Jost et al. 2010). The gran-
ite-gneiss terrains comprise orthogneisses which, in the 
northern portion of the terrain, comprise the Anta, Caiamar, 
Moquém and Hidrolina, and, in the south, the Caiçara and 
Uvá complexes. The metaplutonic rocks have U-Pb ages 
ranging between ca. 3.04 and 2.71 Ga and a few Sm-Nd 
isotopic data obtained by Pimentel et al. (2003) from sam-
ples of the southern Uvá and Caiçara complexes yielded 
whole-rock model ages of ca. 3.0 Ga. The U-Pb discordias 
presented by Queiroz et al. (2008) show patterns indicating 
strong Neoproterozoic Pb loss. 

The greenstone belts successions are made of a basal ultra-
mafic unit made of komatiites, locally presenting well-pre-
served spinifex textures and pillow structures, covered by a 
metabasalt unit with intercalations of chemical and pelitic 
metasediments. At the top, a detrital unit made dominantly 
of conglomerate, quartzite, metapelite and local marble is 
recognized. The ages of the komatiite-bearing lower units are 
still poorly constrained. One whole-rock Sm-Nd isochron 
for komatiitic rocks of the Crixás greenstone belt yielded the 
age of ca. 3.0 Ga (Fortes et al. 1995). However, the prov-
enance study of the upper metasedimentary sequences of 
the belts revealed the presence of Paleoproterozoic detrital 
zircon grains, suggesting that these upper sequences and the 
associated gold deposits are not part of the Archaean geol-
ogy of the greenstone belts (Jost et al. 2010).

Additionaly, a few Neoproterozoic granite intrusions have 
been identified within the TTG terrains. One of them, in the 
southern part of the terrain, was dated at ca. 625 Ma, sug-
gesting that the allochthonous Archaean block had already 
docked at the western margin of the Brasília Belt at that 
time (Pimentel et al. 2003).

Exposures of Paleoproterozoic 
sialic basement 

Paleoproterozoic sialic basement of the Brasília Belt is 
exposed either as small exposures in between younger rock 
units or as the large siderian/rhyacian region in the north-
ern part of the belt, known as the Natividade-Cavalcante 
crustal block (Fig. 3) (Fuck et al. 2014). This consists mainly 
of volcano-sedimentary sequences (e.g. Almas-Dianópolis) 
and a great diversity of orthogneisses and granitic intrusions 
which have been dated between 2.4 and 2.04 Ga (Cruz &amp;amp; 
Kuyumjian 1998, Botelho et al. 2006, Fuck et al. 2013). Most 
of these granitoid rocks are juvenile although some of them 
present Nd models ages which are substantially older than

their crystallization ages, suggesting either local reworking 
of Archaean sialic crust or contamination with metapelites of 
the Paleoproterozoic Ticunzal Formation (Fuck et al. 2013). 
In the south of the block, small Statherian A-type granite 
intrusions are exposed (ca. 1.77 Ga; Pimentel et al. 1991) 
coeval with the rhyolites at the base of the Araí Group rift 
sequence. Additionally to this large basement area in the 
northern part of the belt, other small Paleoproterozoic inliers 
are recognized in different parts of the orogen especially 
in its southern half. Examples are the 2.19 – 2.07 Ga old 
Campinorte Sequence (Della Giustina et al. 2009a, Cordeiro 
et al. 2014), the Silvânia Volcano-Sedimentary Sequence 
(2.12 Ga) and the Jurubatuba granite (2.09 Ga) (Fischel 
et al. 2001), which are pointed out in Fig. 2.

The regional geological and geochronological data avail-
able so far indicate that these exposures of Paleoproterozoic 
sialic rocks represent fragments of the continental basement 
of the supracrustal sequences of the Brasília Belt, whereas 
the Goiás Archaean Block consists of an allochthonous 
terrain accreted to the margin of the orogen at the end of 
the Neoproterozoic. This is supported by the gravity data 
provided by Marangoni et al. (1995), which reveals an 
important gravimetric discontinuity separating the supra-
crustal rocks of the Brasília Belt in the east from the Goiás 
Magmatic Arc, Goiás Archaean Block and the three large 
mafic-ultramafic complexes to the west (ca. 790 Ma old 
Barro Alto, Niquelândia and Canabrava complexes, from 
north to south). 

The metasedimentary sequences: 
provenance and age of the Paranoá, 
Canastra, Ibiá, Araxá and Bambuí Groups 

The age and significance of the different sedimentary rock 
units of the Brasília Belt have been a question of continuous 
debate. They form a thick pile of sedimentary units extend-
ing for more than 1,000 km roughly in the NS direction, 
along the western margin of the São Francisco Craton (Figs. 1 
and 2). Regional, west-dipping thrusts, reverse faults and 
nappes mark the limits between the main stratigraphic units 
and clearly indicate tectonic transport towards the east (for 
a review see Valeriano et al. 2012). Traditional approaches 
have interpreted them as part of a passive margin sequence 
deposited on the continental shelf of the São Francisco paleo-
continent (e.g. Marini et al. 1984). However, the strong 
deformation disrupted the original stratigraphic organiza-
tion, and the general absence of intercalations of volcanic 
rocks has made difficult the exercise of reconstructing the 
original setting and age of the basin(s). More recently, some 
efforts have been carried out in order to investigate the prov-
enance of the original sediments using mainly LA-ICPMS 
U-Pb analyses on detrital zircon (Pimentel et al. 2001, 

Piuzana et al. 2003a, Valeriano et al. 2004, Pimentel et al. 
2011, Rodrigues et al. 2010, 2012, Matteini et al. 2012). 
These studies have provided useful information on the max-
imum age of deposition and on the original tectonic setting 
of the different supracrustal associations, in special of the 
Araxá, Ibiá, Canastra and Paranoá groups (for a review see 
Pimentel et al. 2011).

The Paranoá Group comprises a mature siliciclastic sed-
imentary pile including thick quartzite layers, with interca-
lation of metasiltstone and minor lenses of limestone and 
dolostone (for a review see Campos et al. 2013). It starts 
at the base with a paraconglomerate, followed by trans-
gressive and regressive siliciclastic cycles, ending, at the 
top, with pelites and dolostones containing Conophyton 
metulum Kirichenko stromatolites (Cloud &amp;amp; Dardenne 
1973). Available geochronological and microfossil data 
for the Paranoá Group suggest ages between ca. 1,170 
and 950 Ma for source regions within the São Francisco 
craton (Guimarães 1997, Pimentel et al. 2001, Matteini 
et al. 2012). The 50 m-thick São Miguel conglomerate 
represents the rift phase of the Paranoá basin. It is overlain 
by rhythmites with mudcracks and evaporite layers, typ-
ical of tidal environments. These are followed by marine 
rhythmites and quartzites deposited in a platformal envi-
ronment dominated by tidal currents. The sediments in 
the upper portion of the Paranoá Group display features 
indicating more varied environments, reflecting important 
fluctuations of the sea level. In this section, deeper water 
pelites alternate with tidal rhythmites and quartzites, storm 
rhythmites, limestones and stromatolitic dolomites. Arkoses 
and quartzites at the upper part of the Paranoá sequence 
are chemically similar to passive margin clastic sediments 
(Guimarães 1997).

The Canastra Group comprises a typical platformal 
association of psammitic and pelitic metasediments, with 
some carbonatic intercalations. Phyllites and quartzites are 
the most common rocks. The basal part of the group (Serra 
do Landim Formation) is made of chlorite-rich calc-phyl-
lite or calcschist. Towards the top, the Paracatu and the 
Chapada dos Pilões formations are formed by carbonaceous 
phyllites and quartzites, representing a coarsening-upward 
sequence formed by a regressive megacycle. This is made 
of deep water sediments, grading into turbidites deposited 
on a continental slope by gravitational currents and to top 
platformal deposits with hummocky structures and cross 
stratification, indicating sediment transport from east to 
west. The Canastra Group is considered to be the lateral 
equivalent of the Paranoá Group (Dardenne 2000). The 
relationships between the Canastra, Araxá and Ibiá groups 
are not clear due to intense tectonic imbrication between 
these units.

Evolution of the Brasília Belt



The Ibiá Group has been divided into two formations: 
(i) the Cubatão Formation, at the base, lying on an erosive 
unconformity over the Canastra Group and consisting of a 
thick diamictite unit, and (ii) the Rio Verde Formation, at the 
top, which is made of deep water calcschists and calc-phyl-
lites with fine layers of quartzite. The Cubatão diamictite 
has been correlated with the Jequitaí Diamictite, while the 
phyllites are considered to be equivalent to the metasediments 
of the Araxá Group. Geochemical features of the phyllites 
in the southern part of the belt indicate provenance from a 
primitive island arc source (Seer 1999).

The Araxá Group is dominantly made of micaceous 
quartzite and micaschists including calcschists, chlorite-mus-
covite schist, biotite-garnet schist, staurolite schist and feld-
spar schists, with a few paragneiss and marble intercalations. 
The internal stratigraphy of the group is poorly known due 
to intense deformation with development of low angle thrust 
sheets. Volcanic rocks associated with the Araxá micaschists 
are observed in many areas. These are amphibolites, meta-an-
desites and rhyolites (Pimentel &amp;amp; Fuck 1992, Valeriano &amp;amp; 
Simões1997). In the eastern part of the Araxá Group, the 
ca. 0.79 Ga Maratá Sequence represents a narrow strip of 
rhyolitic/granitic rocks interlayered with the Araxá metased-
iments. This ca.100 km long narrow unit was initially inter-
preted as volcanic (e.g. Pimentel &amp;amp; Fuck 1992) and later 
re-interpreted as highly deformed syn-tectonic intrusions. 
In the latter interpretation, therefore, the U-Pb zircon age 
of 0.79 Ga (Pimentel &amp;amp; Fuck 1992) represents a minimum 
age for the deposition of the Araxá sediments. Amphibolites 
intercalated with the Araxá schists near Goiânia have been 
dated at ca. 0.8 Ga (SHRIMP U-Pb zircon data of Piuzana 
et al., 2003a). The trace element characteristics of these 
amphibolites are very similar to MORBs and they have been 
interpreted as slices of ocean floor tectonically emplaced 
within the Araxá metasediments. In summary, the strati-
graphic relationships between these metaigneous rocks and 
the Araxá metasediments are still far from clear and remain 
controversial due to tectonic imbrications. Another import-
ant feature associated with the Araxá rocks is the presence 
of a large number of small lenses of serpentinite, amphibo-
lite and talc schist, with podiform chromite deposits, rep-
resenting a long, roughly NS ophiolitic mélange (Strieder 
&amp;amp; Nilson 1992).

Provenance data based on U-Pb ages of detrital zircon 
grains of the four stratigraphic units above are summarized 
in Figs. 4 and 5 and reveal important differences between 
the sedimentary units.

The Bambuí Group is the most important Neoproterozoic 
sedimentary unit in central Brazil, forming the easternmost 
part of the Brasilia Belt and covering large areas of the São 
Francisco Craton. Its basal diamictite (Jequitaí Formation) sits

in the Brasília Belt (Martins, Lemos 2007). The Bambuí sed-
imentary rocks comprise three regressive megacycles. Each of 
these megacycles begins with a fast marine transgression 
of regional amplitude, associated with a sudden subsidence of 
the basin evidenced by deep pelitic marine facies, passing to 
shallow-platform facies and tidal to supratidal facies.

The age of deposition of the Bambuí Group has been a 
matter of discussion for many years. Sr and Pb isotopic data 
reported by Parenti-Couto et al. (1981) suggested deposi-
tional ages of ca. 600 Ma. Similarly, previous Rb-Sr and K-Ar 
data on shales reported by Thomaz Filho et al. (1998) have 
produced ages between ca. 640 Ma for the basal Sete Lagoas 
Formation and 540 Ma for the Três Marias Formation at the 
top of the succession. More recently, the cap dolostones at 
the base of the Sete Lagoas overlying Jequitaí diamictites have 
been dated at ca 740 Ma (Pb-Pb isochron; Babinski et al., 
2007). The data, associated with C and Sr isotopic data for 
the carbonates support a Sturtian age for the Jequitaí glaci-
ation. However, the provenance age presented by Rodrigues 
(2008) and Pimentel et al. (2011), for the basal Sete Lagoas, 
Serra de Santa Helena, as well as for the Serra da Saudade 
formations, revealed the presence of a large amount of late 
Neoproterozoic zircons, dated at ca. 600 Ma and even a 
few grains being as young as 550 Ma (Fig. 5). This suggests 
a very late Neoproterozoic or even early Cambrian age for 
the deposition of the Bambuí Group as equally indicated 
by the data presented by Paula-Santos et al. (in press) for 
the basal Sete Lagoas Formation. This is supported by the 
recent discovery of Ediacara fauna in carbonates of the Sete 
Lagoas Formation (Warren et al. 2014).

According to the model by which some of these sedi-
mentary rock units (in special the Paranoá, Canastra, Araxá 
and Ibiá groups) represented the passive margin of the São 
Francisco Craton, the original sediments should display prov-
enance patterns dominated by Paleoproterozoic and Archaean 
zircons, with subordinate mesoproterozoic grains. The results 
demonstrated, however, that this is not the case. A compila-
tion of the provenance data produced by the studies above is 
shown in Fig. 4. Siliciclastic rocks of the Paranoá and Canastra 
groups show provenance ages which are compatible with ero-
sion of source regions within the São Francisco Craton, with 
predominance of Paleoproterozoic detrital zircons. On the 
other hand, the pelitic and psammitic rocks of the Araxá and 
Ibiá Groups display very distinct provenance patterns with 
a large amount of Neoproterozoic zircon grains, as young as 
640 Ma. A younger source is, therefore, required.

the onset of deposition of the pelitic-carbonatic sediments

Evolution of the Brasília Belt



during the assembly of Gondwana. It is exposed in two 
main areas, separated by Goiás Archean Block. The south-
ern portion of the Arc is known as the Arenópolis Arc, and 
the northern, as the Mara Rosa Arc, extending for hundreds 
of kilometers in the NNE direction (Fig. 2). In both areas, 
the arc started its evolution at ca. 900 Ma in intraoceanic 
island arcs (Pimentel &amp;amp; Fuck 1992), and the final wide-
spread magmatic event took place between ca. 630 – 600 
Ma, during closure of the Goiás-Pharusian Ocean (Cordani 
et al. 2013a). The Goiás magmatic arc is formed by:

 ? supracrustal sequences comprising calc-alkaline meta-
volcanic rocks, feldspar-bearing micaschist and minor 
quartzite and marble (e.g. the Santa Terezinha, Mara 
Rosa and Arenópolis sequences), and

 ? calc-alkaline plutonic rock units variably deformed and 
metamorphosed, ranging in composition from gabbro to 
granite, with a large volume of tonalites (Arantes et al. 
1991). The rock units above were intruded by large, 
bimodal, post-tectonic granite intrusion. 

The orthogneisses are mostly hornblende-bearing meta-
diorites, metatonalites and metagranodiorites. The rocks 
display positive ?Nd(T) values and Nd model ages mostly 
between 0.8 and 1.1 Ga (Pimentel et al. 1991, 1997, 2000a, 
Pimentel &amp;amp; Fuck 1992). Geochemical and isotopic data 
suggest that some of the original tonalitic/andesitic mag-
mas were similar to modern adakites (Pimentel et al. 1991, 
Pimentel et al. 1997). U-Pb zircon ages indicate the igneous 
protholits crystallized in three main events: 
1. The oldest igneous events happened between ca. 900 and 

804 Ma, and are represented by the juvenile Arenópolis, 
Sanclerlândia and Mara Rosa orthogneisses, among 
others (Pimentel et al. 1991, Pimentel &amp;amp; Fuck 1992), the 
Sanclerlândia gneiss (828 – 822 Ma) (Laux et al. 2005); 
these plutonic rocks have been compared with primitive 
M-type granitoids of intra-oceanic island arcs; Nd isotopic 
data indicate TDM ages ranging from 0.89 to 1.2 Ga and 
?Nd(T) values between +0.37 and +6.0 (Pimentel &amp;amp; Fuck 
1992, Pimentel et al. 1996; Laux et al. 2005). In the Mara 
Rosa Arc, the Mutunópolis gneisses, crystallized between 
ca. 0.81 and 0.80, represent a sub-group of this group, 
displaying conspicuous inheritance in the zircon pattern 
and considerably older TDM model ages (~2.0 Ga).

2. The second event is represented arc by peraluminous 
muscovite-bearing metagranitoids (e.g. the Creoulos 
Granite) generated between 790 and 786 Ma and exposed 
in the easternmost part of the Arenópolis arc. The ?Nd(T) 
values vary from -1.8 to +3.6 with TDM model ages in 
the interval between 1.46 and 1.1 Ga (Laux et al. 2005).

3. The youngest event took place between 669 and 630 
Ma, being represented by the metaluminous Mantrixã 

gneiss (669 Ma) and by the Turvânia, Palminópolis and 
Firminópolis gneisses with U-Pb emplacement ages 
between 637 and 630 Ma (Laux et al. 2005). The Nd 
isotopic signature is varied: the Matrinxã gneiss has 
positive ?Nd(T) of +2.2 and TDM age of 0.99 Ga, whe-
reas the Turvânia-Palminópolis-Firminópolis gneisses 
have dominantly negative ?Nd(T) values ranging from 
-15.1 to +0.3 with TDM ages between 1.1 and 2.2 G.a 
(Laux et al., 2005). 

Late to post-tectonic bimodal intrusions intruded the 
rock units above both in the Arenópolis and in the Mara 
Rosa arcs. They range in age between ca. 0.63 and 0.54 Ga. 
In the Arenópolis arc, they are mainly metaluminous, high-K 
calc-alkaline to alkaline (A-type) granites associated with 
small gabbrodioritic bodies, whereas in the Mara Rosa arc 
peraluminous granite intrusions are also recognized (e.g. 
Faina and Amador granites).

The different episodes of plutonism in the Goiás Magmatic 
Arc can be recognized in the Mara Rosa area, as demon-
strated in Figure 6; however, the young post-tectonic A-type 
granitic intrusions (ca. 0.54 – 0.52 Ga) have not been iden-
tified in Mara Rosa.

The long history of arc activity suggests successive amal-
gamation of magmatic arcs, either island or continental 
arcs, forming a long and wide composite arc terrain. It is 
clear now that the Goiás Magmatic Arc extends in the 
NNE direction underlying a large area in central Brazil. 
In its northern end, it is covered by the Paleo-Mesozoic 
sedimentary rocks of the Parnaíba Basin and similar arc 
rocks are also present in NW Brazil, in the state of Ceará, 
and in Africa in the Hoggar-Pharusian area where several 
neoproterozoic juvenile magmatic arcs, such as the Tilemsi 
and Amalaoulaou, similar to the Goiás Magmatic Arc, are

The arc system, therefore, formed a semi-continuous belt 
of neoproterozoic subduction-related complexes extend-
ing for over 5,000 km, similar to the present-day arcs of 
the West Pacific Ocean.

dioritic orthogneisses and sillimanite-cordierite-bear-
ing paragneisses.

The orthogneisses arethe dominant rock type in the 
Uruaçu Complex and are generally strongly deformed and 
migmatized. They are associated with mafic and ultramafic 
rocks consisting of garnet-amphibolite, and fine- to medi-
um-grained schists, with cummingtonite, actinolite, talc, 
magnesite, garnet and clinochlore, arranged in a diablas-
tic texture.

Paragneisses are medium- to coarse-grained banded 
granulites, with alternating sillimanite-cordierite rich lay-
ers and quartz-feldspar bands. They contain spinel and 
quartz, which is representative of ultrahigh-temperature 
metamorphism. Garnet-bearing quartz-feldspar-bio-
tite-chlorite-muscovite rock is also common in the supra-
crustal association. 

Recent U-Pb geochronological data indicated that 
orthogneisses, amphibolites and migmatites crystallized 
between ca. 690 and 651 Ma (Della Giustina et al. 2009b). 
Therefore, magmatism and high grade metamorphism 
took place within this 40 My time span. Detrital zircon 
grains for one paragneiss sample have a simple prove-
nance pattern with ages mostly in the range between 760 
and 800 Ma. This suggests that the original basin repre-
sented a syn-orogenic basin, younger than ca. 760 Ma, 
formed by the erosion of sources possibly within the 
Goiás Magmatic Arc. 

Anápolis-Itauçu Complex
The Anápolis-Itauçu Complex (AIC) is exposed in the 

central part of the Brasília Belt. It constitutes an elongated 
NW–SE zone of high-grade rocks exposed between the Goiás 
Magmatic Arc and the lower-grade metasedimentary rocks of 
the Araxá Group. Geological contacts are marked by high-an-
gle shear-zones in the northern segment of the AIC and by 
low-angle nappe structures in the south, thus preventing the 
identification of stratigraphic or cross-cutting relationships 
between the different rock units. Geochronological data sup-
port the interpretation that at least part of the AIC may rep-
resent high-grade equivalents of the Araxá Group (Piuzana 
et al. 2003b) and might be the exposure of the roots of the 
original mountain chain. The AIC includes a variety of rock 
types forming NW-oriented segment, in which three main 
rock associations may be recognized:
1. orthogranulites;
2. paragranulites; and
3. granite intrusions. 

The orthogranulites are represented by tonalitic to gra-
nodioritic gneisses, as well as by mafic rocks, exposed either 
as dioritic/gabbroic intrusions or as mafic-ultramafic layered 

complexes made of peridotite, pyroxenite, gabbro and gab-
bro-anorthosite. Despite the high-grade metamorphism, 
relict igneous textures and compositional layering are usu-
ally observed. Geochemical data suggest a tholeiitic parental 
magma, with LREE enrichment and a negative Eu anom-
aly, and the high-Al content of relict igneous pyroxenes sug-
gests that the intrusion took place at deep levels in the crust. 
Paragranulites are typically represented by aluminous granu-
lites with variable amounts of sillimanite, garnet, spinel, cord-
ierite and feldspar. Calc-silicate rocks and impure quartzites 
are also recognized. Ultrahigh temperature mineral assem-
blages, such as saphirine+quartz, orthopyroxene+ sillimanite 
+quartz, wollastonite+scapolite and hercynite+quartz, have 
been identified in several localities of the AIC and revealed 
temperatures higher than 1,100°C, at moderate pressures 
(~10 kbar; Baldwin et al. 2005; Moraes et al. 2002, 2006). 
Granite intrusions are also part of the AIC. They show 
variable deformational and metamorphic overprint, locally 
reaching granulite facies conditions (Piuzana et al. 2003b). 
Most of these granites are peraluminous, and the Nd iso-
topic signatures indicate that they may be represent prod-
uct of anatexis of either the aluminous paragranulites of the 
AIC or metasedimentary rocks of the Araxá Group (Piuzana 
et al. 2003a). U-Pb zircon ages for cores and metamorphic 
rims are identical in some of these bodies, and, therefore, 
the granites are interpreted as syn-tectonic deep-crustal level 
intrusions (Piuzana et al. 2003a).

SHRIMP U-Pb ages of igneous zircon from orthogran-
ulites including felsic and mafic rocks, as well as the intru-
sive granites, vary between 760 and 630 Ma, and met-
amorphic overgrowths are dated at ca. 650 – 640 Ma, 
suggesting that UHT metamorphism, emplacement of 
mafic magmas and anatexis were partially coeval (Piuzana 
et  al. 2003b, Della Giustina et  al. 2011). TDM Sm-Nd 
model ages of orthogranulites fall into two age intervals, 
between 2.3 – 1.9 Ga and 1.7 – 1.4 Ga, and ?Nd (T) val-
ues are negative, ranging from -9.3 to -1.4 (Piuzana et al. 
2003a). The younger TDM values are in agreement with 
zircon inheritance pattern observed in paragranulites (2.0 
to 0.8 Ga; Piuzana et al. 2003a), which indicates that the 
Neoproterozoic Goiás Magmatic Arc, exposed to the west, 
might have been one of thesedimentary sources contrib-
uting to the basin (Piuzana et al. 2003a). The data suggest 
that the high-grade terrains represent the metamorphic 
core of the Brasília orogen.

Layered Complexes

part of the Brasília Belt (Fig. 6). Due to their geological and 
geochronological similarities, they have been interpreted as 
representative of an originally single regional-scale structure, 
which was disrupted during the Brasiliano event forming 
three individual bodies (Ferreira Filho et al. 1998). The three 
complexes consist of two magmatic systems, distinguished 
by their petrological and isotopic characteristics (Ferreira 
Filho et al. 1994, Ferreira Filho &amp;amp; Pimentel 2000, Pimentel 
et al. 2004, Ferreira Filho et al. 2010).

The composite intrusions are known as the Canabrava, 
Niquelândia and Barro Alto complexes, from north 
to south. In addition, previous denominations for the 
Mesoproterozoic layered units, exposed in the south-
ern and central intrusions, were revisited and, accord-
ingly, they were renamed Serra da Malacacheta and Serra 
dos Borges complexes, respectively (Ferreira Filho et al. 
2010). The ages of these two magmatic systems are still 
controversial. Ferreira Filho et al. (2010), Pimentel et al. 
(2006) and Della Giustina et al. (2011) suggest that the 
western part of the complexes and the associated volca-
no-sedimentary sequences of Juscelândia, Indaianópolis 
and Palmeirópolis are mesoproterozoic in age, whereas 
the eastern part crystallized at ca. 780 Ma. 

On the other hand, Correia et al. (2012) present data for 
the Niquelândia Complex, suggesting that both systems are 
neoproterozoic. According to Ferreira Filho et al. (1994), 
the Mesoproterozoic intrusions (~1.3 Ga) are composed 
of interlayered leucotroctolite, leucogabbro, anorthosite 
and occasional pyroxenite, whereas the Neoproterozoic 
complexes (~0.8 Ga) consist of several cyclic units of dun-
ite, pyroxenite and gabbronorite, within which slices of 
supracrustal rocks and granite intrusions metamorphosed 
under high grade conditions are widespread. Trace element 
composition and Sm-Nd isotopic data reveal contrasting 
geochemical signature for both units; in the older unit, 
analyses attest to a depleted-mantle source for the original 
magmas (Ferreira Filho &amp;amp; Pimentel 2000, Moraes et al. 
2003), whereas the younger association shows a large degree 
of crustal contamination with older sialic crust (Pimentel 
et al. 2004, 2006, Correia et al. 2012). To the west, the 
three composite bodies are in contact with Mesoproterozoic 
bi-modal volcano-sedimentary sequences, namely the 
Palmeirópolis, Indaianópolis and Juscelândia sequences, 
from north to south. The sequences display similar stra-
tigraphy and consist of metapelite, calc-silicate rocks and 
metachert interbedded with metavolcanic rocks, consisting 
of fine-to-medium grained amphibolite and felsic gneiss 
(Brod &amp;amp; Jost 1991, Moraes &amp;amp; Fuck 1994, 1999, Ferreira 
Filho et al. 1998, Moraes et al. 2003). Amphibolites of 
the Juscelândia and Palmeirópolis sequences show positive 

?Nd values and trace element signatures typical of MORB-
like magmas, suggesting that the volcano-sedimentary 
sequences represent a continental rift that evolved towards 
an oceanic basin (Moraes et al. 2003, 2006). The com-
posite mafic-ultramafic complexes, with their respective 
volcano-sedimentary sequences, underwent amphibolite 
to granulite facies metamorphism, with P and T condi-
tions increasing progressively from west to east. Locally, 
ultra-high-temperature mineral assemblages are observed 
(Moraes &amp;amp; Fuck 1994, 2000, Ferreira Filho et al. 1998). 
SHRIMP U-Pb zircon analyses performed on metamor-
phic overgrowths constrain the age of the high-grade 
metamorphism in the composite layered intrusions at 
approximately 760 – 750 Ma (Pimentel et al. 2004, 2006, 
Moraes et al. 2006). Additionally, rutile U-Pb ages reveal 
a younger metamorphic event around 610 Ma, which is 
interpreted as related to the uplift of the complexes at the 
end of the Brasiliano orogeny (Ferreira Filho et al. 1994). 
The current structural configuration of the three compos-
ite layered complexes (Fig. 6) is ascribed to this final tec-
tono-metamorphic episode.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: 
THE TECTONIC EVOLUTION OF 
THE BRASÍLIA BELT

During the last ten years, new LA-ICPMS and SHRIMP 
U-Pb ages, combined with Sm-Nd and, more recently, 
Lu-Hf isotopic data, helped to increase our understanding 
of the tectonic evolution of the Brasília Belt. Major break-
throughs are:

 ? The Goiás Magmatic Arc is a composite arc terrain made 
of magmatic arcs of different ages and nature; its older 
component, formed by calc-alkaline rocks generated 
in intraoceanic island arcs, was followed by two other 
episodes of arc activity, possibly in a active continental 
margin setting; the three main peaks of arc magmatism 
are shown in Figure 7.

 ? The arc system in central Brazil is more extense than 
what envisaged in previous models, extending for at 
least 4,000 km accross central and northeastern Brazil 
and into Africa.

 ? The different stratigraphic units of the supracrustal 
sequences of the belt have distinct ages and tectonic 
significance:
1. the Paranoá and Canastra groups most likely repre-

sent passive margin sequences deposited along the 
continental shelf of the São Francisco Craton,

2. the Araxá and Ibiá groups are syn-orogenic depo-
sits (back- or fore-arc deposits, younger than ca. 
650 Ma), and

78

Evolution of the Brasília Belt



3. the Bambuí Group, which is as young as 550 – 
540 Ma possibly, represents, at least in part, the 
foreland basin of the orogen.

 ? The three large mafic-ultramafic complexes are represen-
tative of two rift systems, one at ca. 1.25 Ga, and the 
younger at. ca. 0.79 Ga. These ages are not common 
in the South America platform, and, therefore, these 
complexes (Barro Alto, Niquelândia and Canabrava 
Complexes) and associated volcano-sedimentary sequences 

(Juscelândia, Indaianópolis and Palmeirópolis, respec-
tively) are interpreted as allochthonous units in the 
Brasília Belt evolution.

 ? The high grade terrains of the Uruaçu and Anápolis-Itauçu 
complexes are neoproterozoic in age and represent the 
metamorphic cores of the orogen; the contemporaneity 
between the UHT metamorphism and emplacement of 
abundant mafic-ultramafic intrusions is noteworthy in the 
Anápolis-Itauçu Complex in the central part of the orogen.

 ? The data discussed here allow, at this stage, the recogni-
tion of first order tectonic compartments of the Brasília 
orogen as indicated in Figure 8. The orogen records, 
therefore, most of the features which normally results 
from the closure of a wide ocean, the Goiás-Pharusian 
ocean, over the long period of time, between ca. 900 
and 600 Ma.
