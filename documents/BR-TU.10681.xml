ABSTRACT: In southern Bahia, there are outcrops of migmatites and 
granulites in the Jequitinhonha Complex, which is part of the northern 
portion of the Araçuaí Orogen. Migmatites (garnet-cordierite diatexi-
te) dominate the metamorphic rocks and host lenses and layers of felsic 
garnet granulite. The conditions of temperature and pressure of meta-
morphism were calculated using conventional thermobarometry and 
the software THERMOCALC. Values around 850 °C and 7 kbar were 
obtained with THERMOCALC. The calculations for the garnet-cordie-
rite diatexite were made considering aH2O equal to 1, but the best results 
of calculations for the granulites are obtained with aH2O values of 0.3. 
Pressure values obtained with GAPES resulted in consistent values with 
THERMOCALC, but the pair garnet-orthopyroxene always produces 
low values for temperature and high ones for pressure. The results are 
consistent with the presence of the pair garnet and cordierite in diatexite 
and orthopyroxene in felsic granulite. From the tectonic point of view, 
the setting in which metamorphism of these rocks occurred requires high 
heat flow with a thermal anomaly in mid continental crust, as indicated 
by values of 7 kbar. Recent studies have favored the closure of a back-arc 
basin for this tectonic setting, but it does not solve the problem that the 
time span between metamorphic peak and the end of granite intrusions, 
involving large bodies of charnockite, is more than 80 million years. 

RESUMO: No sul da Bahia ocorrem migmatitos e granulitos do Com-
plexo Jequitinhonha, porção norte do Orógeno Araçuaí. Os migmati-
tos (granada-cordierita diatexitos) dominam as rochas metamórficas 
e incluem lentes e camadas de granada granulito félsico. As condições 
de temperatura e pressão do metamorfismo foram calculadas com ter-
mobarometria convencional e THERMOCALC. Valores em torno de 
850 °C e 7 kbar foram obtidos com THERMOCALC, sendo que para 
o diatexito os cálculos foram feitos considerando a

H2O
 igual a 1, mas os 

melhores resultados de cálculos para o granulito são feitos com valores de 
a

H2O
 igual a 0,3. Os cálculos de pressão obtidos com GAPES resultam 

em valores concordantes com o THERMOCALC, mas o par granada-or-
topiroxênio sempre produz valores baixos para temperatura e elevados 
para pressão. Os resultados são condizentes com a presença do par grana-
da e cordierita no diatexito e ortopiroxênio no granulito félsico. Do pon-
to de vista tectônico o ambiente em que o metamorfismo dessas rochas 
ocorreu necessita de alto fluxo de calor com anomalia térmica em regiões 
médias da crosta, considerando os valores de 7 kbar. Trabalhos recentes 
têm favorecido o fechamento de bacia back-arc para esse ambiente, mas

INTRODUCTION

To calculate the conditions of pressure and temperature for 
rocks that underwent granulite facies metamorphism should be 
simple and straightforward, as the formation conditions over-
lap those used in most experiments to calibrate thermometers 
and barometers. However, several factors linked to the genesis 
of granulites and migmatites contribute negatively to make this 
task simple and easy. After the metamorphic peak temperature 
is achieved, often greater than 800°C, granulites and migma-
tites cool down slowly in the middle to lower portions of the 
continental crust, a situation that leads to their re-equilibration. 
Furthermore, the presence of a melt phase is common in gran-
ulite facies conditions and can enhance the rate of diffusion or 
even destroy anhydrous metamorphic peak mineralogy during 
cooling (Moraes et al. 2002; White &amp;amp; Powell 2002, 2010). 
For the effective calculation of P-T conditions, either correc-
tions on mineral compositions or thermodynamic modeling 
must be done. The loss of simplicity makes the task complex, 
challenging, attractive and, particularly, an interesting subject.

To illustrate some of the problems related to the P-T cal-
culation in migmatites and granulites, rocks of the Araçuaí 
Orogen, in southern Bahia, will be used as an example. 
Once the results are obtained, an evaluation of their geo-
logical, metamorphic and tectonic meaning is undertaken.

Thermobarometry applied 
to granulites and migmatites: 
problems and restrictions

In continental crust granulite facies metamorphism, in 
addition to recrystallization of the protolith, conditions may 
involve significant amount of partial melting. The percentage 
of the partial melting depends on the rock fertility, with practi-
cally zero for anhydrous basalt, increasing to amphibolite, gran-
ite, greywacke and pelite. The process involves biotite or horn-
blende dehydration melting reactions, at temperatures above 
800°C, producing H2O unsaturated silicate liquid and a solid 
residue, rich in peritectic phases (Fyfe 1973; Thompson 1982; 
Hartel &amp;amp; Pattison 1996; Vielzeuf &amp;amp; Schmidt 2001; White &amp;amp; 
Powell 2002; Johnson et al. 2008). Among the most common 
peritectic minerals are garnet, ortho- and clinopyroxene, min-
erals used in thermobarometry of granulite facies rocks. Slow 
cooling and the coexistence of the granulite residue with sili-
cate melt are responsible for most of the problems related to 
the application of thermobarometric methods to migmatites 

and granulites. The direct calculation of the metamorphic peak 
conditions can be hampered when it is followed by a slow cool-
ing stage, which facilitates continuous exchange of Fe, Mg, 
Ca and even Al, between garnet and pyroxenes until low tem-
peratures, modifying significantly their compositions (Frost &amp;amp; 
Chacko 1988; Harley 1989, 2008; Fitzsimons &amp;amp; Harley 1994; 
Pattison &amp;amp; Bégin 1994; Pattison et al. 2003). As these minerals 
participate in a significant part of thermometers and barome-
ters of granulite facies, it is necessary to evaluate the extent of 
chemical changes to proceed with the methods of correction 
of the mineral compositions. The changes are more extensive 
when pyroxene grains are in direct contact with garnet, or when 
garnet is surrounded by biotite, generating the worst results in 
thermobarometry (Spear &amp;amp; Florence 1992). Major adjustments 
in mineral compositions might be avoided when garnet and 
pyroxene grains are separated by quartz or plagioclase, which 
inhibit re-equilibration of Fe and Mg (Fitzsimons &amp;amp; Harley 
1994; Pattison &amp;amp; Bégin 1994).

For the recovery of the metamorphic peak mineral com-
positions, there are some developed methods (Fitzsimons &amp;amp; 
Harley 1994; Pattison &amp;amp; Bégin 1994; Moraes &amp;amp; Fuck 2000; 
Pattison et al 2003), and most are based on experiments car-
ried out to calibrate both barometers (Harley &amp;amp; Green 1982; 
Harley 1984b) and a thermometer (Harley 1984a), involving 
the garnet-orthopyroxene pair. The calibration of the Harley 
and Green (1982) barometer is independent of the Fe/Mg ratio 
of minerals, but it is not the case with the one produced by 
Harley (1984b). Therefore, it is possible to calculate pressure 
with the aid of both calibrations, and by changing the Fe/Mg 
ratio of orthopyroxene and garnet, the two calibrations may 
provide the same pressure. Starting from the adjusted compo-
sitions, the temperature of the metamorphic peak is calculated 
by using the orthopyroxene-garnet thermometer (Fitzsimons &amp;amp; 
Harley 1994; Pattison &amp;amp; Bégin 1994). A variant of this method 
also takes into account the modal proportion of minerals to 
limit and control the corrections made (Pattison et al. 2003).

The coexistence of a silicate melt and granulite residue may be 
responsible for changes in post-peak metamorphic rock mineral 
assemblage, involving consumption and production of mineral 
phases. Also, the presence of melt facilitates the diffusion of ele-
ments between minerals, increasing the efficacy in the chemical 
re-equilibrium during cooling, which may promote profound 
changes in their composition, thwarting successful thermobaro-
metric calculations. If the melt is not segregated from granulite 
residue before cooling, the minerals of metamorphic peak may 

The model of tectonic switching is suggested here as it can explain the 
maintenance of high temperatures for a more extended interval of time.

Thermobarometry in migmatites and granulites



react with it and suffer total or partial consumption that can 
even erase the evidence of granulite facies in the rock (Powell &amp;amp; 
Downes 1990; Moraes et al. 2002; White &amp;amp; Powell 2002, 2010). 
Full preservation of the granulite facies mineral assemblage is 
achieved by the removal of most produced melt (Moraes et al. 
2002; White &amp;amp; Powell 2002). Additional problems may hap-
pen due to crystallization of entrapped melt within the residue, 
which generates new minerals not present during the metamor-
phic peak, for example, plagioclase, biotite and ilmenite, which 
if used in thermobarometric calculations will generate values of 
temperature and pressure without any geological significance.

Modern softwares use internally consistent thermodynamic 
data sets for thermobarometric calculations and other petrological 
tasks, such as TWQEEU (Berman 1988) and THERMOCALC 
(Holland &amp;amp; Powell 1998, 2011). Here, the thermobarometric 
calculations are based on a group of linearly independent reac-
tions that use all thermodynamic information of metamorphic 
peak mineral assemblages; consequently, the results produced 
are robust (Powell &amp;amp; Holland 1994). If it is possible to have 
the bulk composition of the protolith before granulite facies 
metamorphism and partial melting took place, for example, by 
analyzing an amphibolite facies regional equivalent, it is possi-
ble to calculate pseudosections and, through them, to make a 
model of metamorphism and partial melting processes (White 
&amp;amp; Powell 2002; Powell et al. 2005; Baldwin et al. 2005). The 
beauty of pseudosections is also its doom, because its calcula-
tion is based on the rock bulk composition, but in the case of 
migmatites and granulites, which involved partial melting and 
segregation of its melt phase, original rock bulk composition 
is lost, making it difficult or impossible to use the method for 
a precise thermobarometry.

Geological Setting of the Araçuaí Orogen
The Araçuaí Belt was defined as the fold belt formed during 

the Brasiliano Orogeny, which limits the south and southeast 
borders of the São Francisco Craton in Minas Gerais and Bahia 
(Almeida 1977). It is part of the Mantiqueira Province (Almeida 
et al. 1977, 1981), or the northern portion of the Mantiqueira 
Orogenic System (Heilbron et al. 2004), or even the external 
portion of the Brazilian side of the Araçuaí-West Congo Orogen 
(Trompette 1994; Pedrosa-Soares &amp;amp; Wiedemann-Leonardos 
2000; Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2001, 2007, Fig. 1). The last con-
cept is adopted here for further discussions.

As the geological knowledge evolved, correlations between 
Brazilian and African counterparts were done, especially between 
Araçuaí and West Congo fold belts and São Francisco and Congo 
cratons (e.g. Brito-Neves &amp;amp; Cordani 1991, Trompette 1994). 
It was then recognized that rocks in the once adjacent continents 
represent different portions of a whole orogen, the Araçuaí-West-
Congo Orogen (Pedrosa-Soares &amp;amp; Noce 1998; Pedrosa-Soares &amp;amp; 
Wiedemann-Leonardos 2000; Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2001, 2007), 

which is referred here, for simplicity, as the Araçuaí Orogen. For 
details and definitions of the orogen portions, equally its stratig-
raphy, tectonic units and magmatic suites, the reader must access 
recent in-depth reviews (Alkmin et al. 2007; Noce et al. 2007; 
Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2007, 2008; Pedrosa-Soares &amp;amp; Alkmin 
2011; Gradim et al., 2014).

The orogen was developed from the end of Neoproterozoic 
until Cambrian times (Fig. 1). The continental rift stage of the 
precursor basin is represented by, at least, six events of rifting 
and anorogenic magmatism. The youngest events are recorded 
by rocks of the basal portion of the Macaúbas Group, mafic 
dikes of the Pedro Lessa Suite and anorogenic intraplate gran-
ites of the Salto da Divisa Suite, all of these rocks being older 
than 870 Ma (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2007; Pedrosa-Soares &amp;amp; 
Alkmin 2011). The passive margin rocks are represented by 
mid to upper formations of the Macaúbas Group, including 
mafic-ultramafic rocks, pelites and cherts, part of an ophio-
lite complex that represents the oceanic portion of this basin 
(Pedrosa-Soares et al. 1992, 1998, 2001, 2008, Aracema et al. 
2000). Zircon grains of plagiogranite, associated with the mafic 
oceanic rocks, yielded 660 ± 29 Ma, age considered as the time 
oceanic crust was formed (Queiroga et al. 2007). The pelites that 
derived migmatites of the Jequitinhonha Complex (Almeida 
&amp;amp; Litwinski 1984) may as well be part of this passive margin 
(Pedrosa-Soares &amp;amp; Wiedemann-Leonardos 2000, Sampaio 
et al. 2004, Heilbron et al. 2004, Pedrosa- Soares et al. 2008).

Extensive granite magmatism is recognized, ranging from 
arc-related, representing a pre-collisional stage (ca. 630 – 
580 Ma), to sin-collisional (ca. 580 – 560 Ma), up to post-col-
lisional (ca. 530 – 490 Ma). Structural relationships, as well as 
petrographic types, geochemistry signatures and isotopic ages 
are used to define this evolution and separate the bodies in five 
suites (e.g. Pedrosa-Soares &amp;amp; Wiedemann-Leonardos 2000, 
Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2001, 2008, Silva et al. 2005). The G1 
suite defines the pre-collisional stage and comprises deformed 
calc-alkaline tonalite and granodiorite bodies with ages that 
span from 630 to 585 Ma. S-type granites, mostly deformed 
and bearing cordierite and garnet are denominated as G2 and 
G3 suites; they define the sin-collisional stage and present ages 
between 585 and 535 Ma. The post-collision stage is marked 
by topographic highs, as the sugar-loafs bodies of G4 and G5 
suites, with ages that span from 520 to 490 Ma (Siga Jr. 1986; 
Pedrosa-Soares &amp;amp; Wiedemann-Leonardos, 2000; Pedrosa-
Soares et al. 2001). These granite bodies were emplaced mainly 
into migmatites of the Jequitinhonha Complex and rocks of 
the Macaúbas Group and are represented, respectively, by two 
mica S-type granite and charnockite bodies, the last ones with 
marked mantle-derived signature (Pedrosa-Soares &amp;amp; Wiedemann-
Leonardos 2000; Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2007).

Two different units of the Araçuaí Orogen are constituted 
of migmatites derived from pelites, the Nova Venécia Complex,

which represents rocks deposited and metamorphosed in the 
back-arc basin (Gradim et al. 2014), and the Jequitinhonha 
Complex (Almeida &amp;amp; Litwinski 1984; Sampaio et al. 2004), 
whose protoliths were deposited in distal passive margin 
(Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2007; Gonçalves-Dias et al. 2011). The 
first geochronological data for these rocks was a Rb-Sr reference 
isochron using samples from both units. The results obtained 
indicate that the metamorphic event affecting these units 
occurred at 550 ± 80 Ma (Cordani 1973). Later on, an inter-
val for the age of metamorphism between 660 and 570 Ma, 
based on Rb-Sr isochrons, was determined for rocks of the 
Jequitinhonha Complex, with cooling ages between 540 and 
480 Ma (Siga Jr. 1986). Initial Sr87/Sr86 ratios indicate crustal 
sources of Paleoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic ages (Siga Jr. 
1986) for the Jequitinhonha Complex. Dating of detrital zir-
con grains extracted from the Nova Venécia Complex have 
yielded ages spreading between 630 and 2100 (Noce et al. 
2004). The newer acquired data set of detrital zircon from rocks 
of the Jequitinhonha Complex resulted in ages between 960 
and 2540 Ma, with the youngest grains dated at 898 ± 8 Ma, 
considered to be the maximum age of deposition of this unit, 
what makes the unit chrono-correlated to the upper portion of 
the Macaúbas Group (Gonçalves-Dias et al. 2011).

P-T data of metamorphism and partial melting of migma-
tites of the Jequitinhonha Complex are scarce. Temperature is 
calculated between 715 and 790°C by using garnet-cordierite 

and garnet-biotite pairs (Uhlein et al. 1998). Crystallinity 
degree of graphite from graphite deposits hosted by migmatites 
and related rocks in northeast Minas Gerais indicates tem-
peratures between 660 and 705°C, whereas P-T calculation 
using THERMOCALC yielded values of 790 ± 40°C and 
5.0 ± 0.5 kbar for metamorphic peak conditions; TWEEQU 
yielded 890 ± 50°C and 6.7 ± 0,6 kbar (Belém, 2006).

Location of the study area
The investigated rocks are located in the south of Bahia, 

in the region of Teixeira de Freitas, Itanhém, Itamaraju and 
Jucuruçu (Fig. 2), and are part of the Jequitinhonha Complex, 
in accordance to the geological map of the area (Sampaio 
et al. 2004). Only outcrops where migmatites and granu-
lites crop out were sampled.

Thermobarometry in migmatites and granulites



to the G4 and G5 suites (Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2007), as 
mentioned above.

Garnet-cordierite diatexite: 
leucosome and residue

Using the classification of migmatites proposed by Sawyer 
(2008), the rock that dominates the investigated region is 
classified as garnet-cordierite diatexite, given that a high 
proportion of partial melting generated a rock dominated 
by neosome. Leucosome, melanosome and a mesocratic res-
idue are recognized, formed of cordierite rich-domains with 
subordinate garnet that alternate with quartz-feldspar domi-
nated domains. Cordierite and garnet may reach 30 to 40% 
in volume of some neosome. Due to high degree of partial 
melting and segregation of large volumes of melt, now rep-
resented by leucosome, no portion of the garnet-cordierite 
diatexite represents its original bulk-composition. The struc-
tures observed in the diatexite are stromatic (Fig. 3A), schlie-
ren (Fig. 3B) and nebulitic (Fig. 3C). The leucosome veins 
may be either parallel to foliation, considered as formed in 
situ and present biotite selvedges at their edges (Fig. 3A), or 
cross-cut the foliation, as in source leucosome, bearing gar-
net porphyroblasts (Figs. 3D and 3E) or cordierite clusters 
(Fig. 3F). In most of the outcrops the rock is a mesocratic 
residue with homogeneous matrix, foliated or not, hosting 
up to 5 – 7 cm garnet porphyroblasts, and up to 40% of 
cordierite dispersed in the matrix. Garnet and cordierite may 
be associated with leucosome, which demonstrates a close 
relationship between the generation of peritectic porphy-
roblasts and biotite-related melt reactions (Figs. 3D to 3F). 
Leucosome blind veins are common and they merge with 
portions of trapped melt in the rock (Fig. 3D). Diatexite 
with nebulitic structure is common and is formed in low 
strain regions (Fig. 3G), where the volume of leucosome 
overcomes the residue, which also presents schlieren and 
schollen with no preferential orientation. Locally, the coales-
cence of leucosome veins can form smaller bodies of cord-
ierite-garnet granite (Fig. 3H).

All collected samples for thermobarometry are of the 
mesocratic residue with either none, or just small volumes 
of leucosome.

In situ and in source 
leucosome petrography

Observed in the petrographic microscope, leucosome 
veins may be divided into two compositional types. The 
first is dominated by quartz and cordierite, with subordinate 
amounts of feldspars, whereas garnet may be present or not; 
the second type has granitic composition, with similar pro-
portions of quartz, K-feldspar and plagioclase, with minor 
cordierite and garnet. In quartz- and cordierite-dominated 

leucosome, quartz forms large elongated grains, sometimes 
more than 1 cm across; contacts are straight or jagged with 
other quartz grains and chess-board like sub-grains are present 
(Fig. 4A). The cordierite grains are elongated and rounded, 
with rare subhedral plagioclase inclusions (Fig 4B); they 
may contain inclusions of sillimanite, as fibrolite or larger 
xenoblastic grains, rounded biotite, monazite and zircon 
(Figs. 4C and 4D); edges commonly are replaced by a mix-
ture of white mica, chlorite and carbonate. Feldspars occur 
because lenses are parallel to the foliation and at the edges of 
leucosome veins; grains are elongated in granoblastic texture, 
rarely subhedral (Fig. 4C). Subhedral plagioclase grains occur 
in the matrix, but it is not uncommon to recognize recrys-
tallized rims, indicating crystallization from the entrapped 
melt, but with subsequent deformation (Fig. 4B). Garnet also 
occurs within the leucosome, forming grains with irregular 
edges and bearing rounded inclusions of quartz, biotite and 
rare plagioclase; these grains are interpreted as not totally 
dissolved during partial melting and enclosed by peritectic 
garnet. Melanosome is dominated by cordierite, rich in sil-
limanite inclusions; it occurs in leucosome edges and may 
be partially enveloped by coarse-grained biotite (Fig. 4D); 
in some domains garnet is added to the melanosome min-
eral assemblage and it is also partially replaced by biotite or 
biotite-quartz-feldspar symplectite; biotite occurs as large 
laths, at least 1 mm in size, close to garnet or cordierite, to 
very fine-grained away from them.

The second type of leucosome veins is dominated by 
K-feldspar (50%), quartz (45%) and plagioclase (5%). 
K-feldspar is mesoperthite, idiomorphic to subidiomorphic, 
with clear edges, without exsolutions. Plagioclase occurs in 
smaller amounts, and in some thin sections, is present only 
as myrmekite. Quartz occurs as interstitial phase between 
feldspar grains, indicating that it was the last phase to crys-
tallize from the melt. It also occurs as rounded inclusions 
within feldspars. Cordierite and garnet may be present and 
have the same textural features as described above.

Granite veins petrography
Veins of garnet granite and garnet-cordierite granite are 

abundant, crosscut the diatexite and can also form small, 
metric, isolated bodies due to collected liquid from the 
leucosome network (Fig. 3H). An igneous serial texture 
is dominant, marked by the occurrence of phenocrysts of 
perthitic to mesoperthitic orthoclase, with rounded quartz 
inclusions; the largest grains have straight edges, though 
jagged contacts are not uncommon. Plagioclase is intersti-
tial, comprising 5 – 8% modal proportion, subordinate to 
quartz and orthoclase; grains present optical zoning and 
rounded quartz inclusions. Cordierite and garnet aggregates 
or porphyroblasts are common within the granite veins.

Thermobarometry in migmatites and granulites



Garnet contains biotite and rounded quartz inclusions, 
whereas cordierite occurs as isolated grains or as clusters of 
xenoblastic grains with inclusions of biotite or sillimanite, 
which may, in some cases, be as abundant as the host cord-
ierite. Locally, late deformation imprints a protomylonite 
texture on some veins, generating strong orientation, wavy 
extinction, sub-grains, new grains, and deformation bands, 
in both quartz and feldspars.

Residue petrography
The residue portion of the garnet-cordierite diatexite 

makes up between 30 to 70% of its volume. It is a mesoc-
ratic rock with gneissic aspect. The residue is dominated by 

cordierite (20 to 45%), quartz (20 to 35%) and orthoclase 
(10 to 30%), with varied proportions of garnet (1 to 30%) 
and plagioclase (1 to 15%); biotite is mostly retrometamor-
phic and in smaller amounts (&amp;lt;8%). Monazite, zircon, apa-
tite and Fe-Ti oxide are the most common accessory phases, 
along with sillimanite and green spinel. The rock texture is 
granoblastic but oriented, with medium- to coarse-grained 
grain size, larger than 5 mm in average (Fig. 5A). Lenticular 
clusters of feldspar and cordierite, elongated and recrystallized 
quartz, as well as biotite define the foliation. The cordierite 
grains may be clear, but it is common to have rounded or 
xenoblastic inclusions of sillimanite, biotite, and green spi-
nel, with minor amounts of monazite and zircon (Fig. 5B).

Garnet is poikiloblastic, with xenoblastic or rounded inclu-
sions of quartz, plagioclase and cordierite, itself with  inclusions 
of sillimanite, biotite, and zircon (Figs. 5C and 5D). Garnet 
and cordierite, within the leucosome, may have corroded and 
irregular edges; some rims are replaced by biotite, usually in 
symplectites with quartz and feldspars; sometimes magne-
tite and, very rarely, sillimanite is present (Fig. 5D). It is not 
uncommon to observe an irregular cordierite corona around 
garnet, both partially replaced by biotite-quartz-feldspar sym-
plectite, which in turn is surrounded by thin graphic inter-
growth of quartz and feldspar (Figs. 5E and 5F). This texture 
represents consecutive reactions between entrapped melt and 
Fe-Mg porphyroblasts and final crystallization of the melt 
phase. The residue is poor in plagioclase, which occurs as rare 
subhedral (Fig. 5G) or interstitial grains, sometimes as films 
in optical continuity (Fig. 5H), which were formed due to 
crystallization of entrapped melt.

Felsic granulite – field 
aspects and petrography

The felsic granulite is subordinated to the garnet-cord-
ierite diatexite. The contact relationship between them can-
not always be defined, but in some outcrops a transition is 
observed between biotite-rich diatexite and felsic granulite, 
and the contact is parallel to the regional foliation (Fig. 6A). 
Leucosome veins are arranged parallel to the regional folia-
tion (Fig. 6B), with blind endings and, locally, cross cutting 
felsic granulite foliation. Inside leucosome, orthopyroxene 
and garnet porphyroblasts are commonly observed.

Felsic granulite is composed of quartz, plagioclase, ortho-
clase, orthopyroxene, garnet, biotite and ilmenite; apatite 
and zircon are the main accessory phases. The texture is gra-
noblastic and oriented due to the disposition of elongated 
orthopyroxene, feldspars and ilmenite grains. Quartz forms 
elongated aggregates of large grains, parallel to the foliation, 
in flaser texture. Among the feldspars, plagioclase stands out, 
and orthoclase is mesoperthitic. Orthopyroxene and garnet 
occur as porphyroblasts, 2 to 3 mm long (Fig. 7A), though 
the latter may reach diameter larger than 1 cm. Garnet is 
xenoblastic, presents many quartz and plagioclase inclusions 
and the edges are partially replaced by biotite (Fig. 7B), 
which also occurs at orthopyroxene rims (Fig. 7A). Quartz 
and feldspars films mimicking the entrapped melt are rare, 
but occur in triple junctions (Fig. 7C) or around subhedral 
biotite and among plagioclase grains (Fig. 7D).

MINERAL CHEMISTRY

Based on petrography, five thin sections were selected 
for analysis using an Electron Probe Microanalyzer, by 

Cameca, model SX 100, with four spectrometers equipped 
with two TAP crystals, one LIF and one PET. The analyzes 
were performed with conditions of 15 kV, 15 nA and beam 
of 5? diameter at the Laboratoire Magmas et Volcans, at 
the Département des Sciences de la Terre, Université Blaise 
Pascal, Clermont-Ferrand, France. The following chemi-
cal elements were analyzed for each of the listed minerals:

 ? garnet – Si, Ti, Al, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mg and Ca;
 ? cordierite – Si, Ti, Al, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mg, Na and K;
 ? feldspars – Si, Al, Fe, Mn, Ca, Na and K;
 ? orthopyroxene – Si, Ti, Al, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mg and Ca;
 ? biotite – Si, Ti, Al, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mg, Ca, Na, K and F;
 ? spinel – Si, Ti, Al, Cr, Zn, Fe, Mn, and Mg.

Punctual analyses were performed on feldspar, biotite 
and cordierite, core and rim, in at least three grains in two 
or three different fields of the same thin section. In garnet 
and orthopyroxene, the composition profiles were built with 
eight to twenty points across the porphyroblasts. The min-
erals of five samples were analyzed, three samples of gar-
net-cordierite diatexite residue (RF-01, RF-06, RF-24) and 
also two of felsic granulite (RF-03 and RF-16). From the 
garnet-cordierite diatexite, cordierite, garnet, feldspar, bio-
tite and spinel were analyzed; and from felsic granulite, 
orthopyroxene, garnet, feldspar and biotite were analyzed. 
Representative analyses of mineral chemical compositions 
are presented in Tables 1 and 2.

Garnet
Garnet chemistry is controlled by bulk rock composi-

tion and, in each sample, specific features are recognized. 
In the garnet-cordierite diatexite, garnet composition is 
dominated by end-members almandine and pyrope, with 
values between 70 and 80% and between 15 and 30% 
respectively, depending on the sample (Fig. 8). In the three 
samples, the almandine molecule increases subtly from core 
to rim, while pyrope decreases. The amounts of calcium and 
manganese are low, with concentrations between 2 and 3%, 
and grossular features flat profile and spessartine increases 
slightly toward the edges. The composition may be gener-
ally described as alm70pyr25grs3sps2.

In felsic granulite, garnet composition is also dominated 
by the almandine molecule, followed by pyrope, grossular 
and spessartine, presenting, however, differences in relation 
to garnet of garnet-cordierite diatexite. In the felsic granu-
lite, garnet composition is richer in calcium than in diatex-
ite, reflected in the increased amount of grossular, around 
10%, and corroborated by the common presence of pla-
gioclase. The compositional profiles are almost flat, with 
small variations derived from slight increase of iron and 
decreasing magnesium towards the rims. Garnet composition

is also controlled by variations in granulite bulk composi-
tion, as RF-03 is richer in iron and poorer in magnesium, 
with average composition alm70pyr20grs8sps2, and RF-16 is 
richer in magnesium with average composition alm65pyr-

25grs10sps5 (Fig. 9).

Cordierite
Cordierite occurs exclusively in the garnet-cordierite 

diatexite and presents homogeneous composition in all 

analyzed samples, with average XMg 0.69, Fe 0.62 apfu, and 
without chemical zoning.

Feldspars
In the garnet-cordierite diatexite, feldspars have no com-

positional zoning; orthoclase may contain between 16 and 
22% of albite molecule with pure albite exsolution lamel-
lae. The composition of K-feldspar was not reintegrated. 
The plagioclase composition is An24.

Orthoclase is almost pure in felsic granulite, with a max-
imum of Ab5, while the plagioclase composition is An47 in 
sample RF-16, richer in magnesium, and An40 in sample 
RF-03, poorer in magnesium.

Orthopyroxene
Orthopyroxene is present only in felsic granulite and its 

composition varies according to the amount of magnesium in 
the bulk rock composition. In RF-16, richer in magnesium, 
XMg is 0.48, the grains have mild chemical zoning, with alu-
minum richer core, 0.07 apfu, with rims with 0.056 apfu, 
which is offset by the increase in magnesium, XMg = 0.50. 
In sample RF-03, poorer in magnesium, the analyzed grains 
present no chemical zoning, with XMg between 0.41 and 0.42, 
and aluminum between 0.052 and 0.055 apfu.

Biotite
Biotite occurs in three textural types in the garnet-cord-

ierite diatexite, either as porphyroblasts, grain clusters or 
with quartz and feldspar symplectite. The composition is 
homogeneous with XMg around 0.54 in the first two types, 
but in symplectite XMg is lower, 0.50. The Ti content is high, 

with values up to 5.2% (0.37 apfu) in porphyroblasts and 
4.5% (0.26 apfu) in symplectite.

CALCULATION OF PRESSURE AND 
TEMPERATURE OF METAMORPHISM 

AND PARTIAL MELTING

The calculation of P-T metamorphic peak conditions for 
described granulites and diatexites is presented in Tables 3 
and 4, with a series of results, the metamorphic and partial 
melting meaning of which, as well as their tectonic impli-
cations, will be discussed below.

The first P-T calculations are made with the software 
THERMOCALC (Powell &amp;amp; Holland 1988), in which tem-
perature and pressure are calculated separately, then the two 
variables are calculated jointly with the average P-T method 
(Powell &amp;amp; Holland 1994). For samples of the garnet-cordierite 
diatexite, it is considered that garnet, cordierite, sillimanite, 
biotite, orthoclase, plagioclase and quartz are the paragen-
esis of the metamorphic peak and that H2O was in excess 
(aH2O = 1). Values of 6.6 kbar and 850°C are calculated for

Thermobarometry in migmatites and granulites



the RF-1 and RF-6 samples, with values somewhat higher for 
RF-24, 6.7 kbar and 880°C. There is not much difference in 
results if pressure and temperature are calculated separately 
or together, in this last case using the average P-T method 
(Tab. 3). It is not possible to calculate pressure or tempera-
ture if sillimanite is excluded from the mineral paragenesis.

For the felsic granulite, unrealistic values of T higher 
than 1000°C are calculated when the rock is considered sat-
urated with water. Several calculations are made with dif-
ferent H2O activity values, and the calculations made with 
aH2O = 0.3 yielded calculated temperature as 850°C, similar 
to the values calculated for the garnet-cordierite diatexite. 
The aH2O values do not influence in pressure calculation and 
values around 6.7 kbar are calculated (Tab. 3).

The P-T calculations are also made with the average P-T 
method with THERMOCALC, pressure and temperature 
being calculated at the same time when it is possible to 
evaluate the correlations between those intensive variables. 
When the correlation factor is high, close to 1, it indicates 
that there is a strong dependence of the results obtained for 
pressure and temperature.

For the garnet-cordierite diatexite, the calculated results 
are independent of the employed method. Calculations of 

pressure and temperature made separately or using the average 
P-T method produced similar values within uncertainties. 
However, the average P-T method yielded high correlation, 
larger uncertainties, and this means that if the calculated 
temperature is reliable, calculated pressure is reliable as well, 
but the reverse is also true. From a statistical point of view, 
the results are valid, reliable and interesting because if tem-
perature and pressure are calculated separately the results are 
very close to the ones produced by the average P-T method, 
and the high correlation indicates the good quality of the 
results obtained in the investigated rocks (Tab. 3).

For the felsic granulite, the calculations with the aver-
age P-T method are quite dependent on aH2O, but the best 
results, from a statistical point of view, are obtained with 
aH2O values of 0.3, because the smallest uncertainties are 
calculated (Tab. 3). Furthermore, results are similar to the 
conditions in which temperature and pressure are calcu-
lated separately and are also similar to those calculated for 
the cordierite-garnet diatexite samples.

The thermobarometric calculation with the orthopyrox-
ene-garnet pair, using the calibrations of Harley and Green 
(1982) and Harley (1984a, b) produces consistently lower tem-
peratures and much higher pressures than THERMOCALC.

For RF-16 sample, temperature calculated values of 730 and 
754°C are obtained with the Harley (1984b) calibration, 
using two pairs of garnet and orthopyroxene. For the same 
pairs, pressure values of 13.6 and 14.0 kbar, and 13.5, and 
12.8 kbar are calculated, respectively, with Harley (1984a) 
and Harley and Green (1982) calibrations. For RF-3 sam-
ple, one garnet and two orthopyroxene grains were used in 
P-T calculations, resulting in calculated temperatures of 785 
and 776°C, with the same garnet core and each of ortho-
pyroxene cores analyses. The calculated pressure using the 
same sets of analyses resulted in 16.7 and 15.0 kbar, and 
14.0, and 15.4 kbar, using the Harley (1984a) and Harley 
and Green (1982) calibrations (Tab. 4).

The results calculated with compositions of the garnet-or-
thopyroxene pair are discrepant from the ones produced by 
THERMOCALC and are also not consistent with those 
observed in experimental investigations with parageneses 
containing cordierite, whose stability is not higher than 10-11 
kbar (e.g. Hensen, 1971). The exaggerated pressure results 
of calculations are controlled by the low concentration of 
Al2O3 in orthopyroxene, since the calibrations are designed 
for rocks in which orthopyroxene is aluminum-rich, with 
concentrations greater than 6 to 8%.

Pressure calculation using the garnet-quartz-plagioclase-py-
roxene barometer is made using three different calibrations 
(Newton &amp;amp; Perkins 1982; Perkins &amp;amp; Chipera 1985; Eckert 
et al. 1991). Thermodynamic and experimental calibrations 
are available for the barometer, involving orthopyroxene 
(GAPES) or clinopyroxene (GADS) in the following reactions:

grossular + 2 pyrope + 3 quartz = 3 anorthite + 3 ensta-
tite (GAPES)

2 grossular + pyrope + 3 quartz = 3 anorthite + 3 diop-
side (GADS)

The Newton and Perkins (1982) calibration is thermo-
dynamic and can be used with either ortho- or clinopyrox-
ene, both treated as ideal solid solutions. The non-ideality 
in garnet solid solution is attributed to grossular-pyrope 
binary, considered symmetrical (regular model), with 

Margules parameter WCaMg of 3300 ± 1.5 T (K) calo-
ries/mole. Plagioclase is treated as non-ideal asymmet-
ric solid solution (sub-regular model), with values for 
the Margules parameters of WAn = 2095 cal and WAB = 
6746 cal. The calculated pressure with GAPES is consid-
ered the most reliable and results in values about 2 kbar 
higher than those calculated with GADS. Uncertainties 
of 1.5 kbar are estimated for GAPES and 1.6 kbar for 
GADS. The authors suggest that an empirical adjustment 
of -0.6 kbar for GAPES and +1.6 for GADS should be 
made. Perkins and Chipera (1985) presented another 
GAPES thermodynamic calibration, involving the reac-
tions of Mg and Fe end-members. The first is a calibra-
tion in the CMAS system (CaO, MgO, Al2O3, SiO2), 
using measurements of the thermodynamic properties 
of the involved end-members. The second calibration is 
based on experimental data available (Bohlen et al. 1980, 
1983) for the CFMAS system (CaO, FeO, Al2O3, SiO2). 
The plagioclase activity model developed by Newton and 
Perkins (1982) is used; orthopyroxene is considered as an 
ideal solid solution; garnet solid solution is treated with 
a quaternary model, proposed by Ganguly and Saxena 
(1984). The application of Mg end-member reaction is 
not recommended for Fe-rich rocks (Fe/(Fe + Mg) &gt; 0.5). 
The uncertainty is estimated to be ± 1 kbar. The pressure 
calculated from the Mg end-member reaction produces 
higher values than from the Fe end-member calibration 
and they are also higher than values produced by the 
calibration of Newton and Perkins (1982). Eckert et al. 
(1991) presented an experimental and thermodynamic cal-
ibration based on redetermination of enthalpy of GAPES 
and GADS reactions, using calorimetry to replace the 
one used in the equation of Newton and Perkins (1982). 
Also, the activity models of Newton and Perkins (1982) 
for garnet and plagioclase are adopted, while pyroxene 
is treated as ideal solid solution. Uncertainties of ± 1.55 
kbar to GAPES and ± 1.90 kbar to GADS were signed.

The application of GAPES barometer for felsic granulite 
samples RF-3 and RF-16 results in values between 8 and 
9 kbar (Tab. 5). The calculated pressure values are 1 to 1.5 kbar 
higher than the ones calculated with THERMOCALC, but 
within the stability field of cordierite observed in the associ-
ated garnet-cordierite diatexite, and are compatible within 
the uncertainty range when the correction of -0.6 kbar is 
applied, within the uncertainty range.

The calculated P-T conditions, about 7 kbar and 850 °C, 
are within the granulite facies conditions, if a minimum tem-
perature of 800°C is considered as the lower limit as sug-
gested by Pattison et al. (2003). Such conditions are com-
patible with the stability fields of orthopyroxene, present in 
the felsic granulite, cordierite, which is extremely abundant

Thermobarometry in migmatites and granulites



in the garnet-cordierite diatexite, and sillimanite, the Al2SiO5 
polymorph observed in these rocks.

From the mineralogical perspective, the felsic granu-
lite has a composition equivalent to a greywacke, similar to 
the one modeled by Johnson et al. (2008, figure 1d of that 
paper), and given the calculated P-T conditions, the same 
paragenesis is observed, which is formed together with a pro-
duction of 10 to 15% partial melting, close to exhaustion 
of biotite and just above the cordierite stability field for this 
bulk composition. This is in agreement with field and petro-
graphic observation, as thin leucosome veins are observed 
within the felsic granulite (Figs. 6A and 6B). Therefore, the 
metamorphic peak conditions are achieved crossing biotite 
breakdown/melting reaction, producing a granulite residue 
and orthopyroxene-bearing melt, now represented by leu-
cosome. The low amount of partial melting is constrained 
by low fertility of this kind of protolith, as well as by low 
amount of available water.

Larger amounts of leucosome, observed in association 
with the garnet-cordierite diatexite, are compatible with cal-
culated P-T conditions, if it is considered that the follow-
ing reaction was crossed during the progressive stage of rock 
P-T path: sillimanite + biotite + quartz = garnet + cordierite 
+ orthoclase + liquid, in the KFMASH system, although 
plagioclase might be added as reactant as well (Spear et al. 
1999). Through the partial melting modeling of pelite, or 
adding plagioclase to have an aluminum-rich greywacke as 
protolith, the rock can cross this reaction at the calculated 
P-T conditions, producing, at least, 50% of partial melt 
and a residue dominated by cordierite and garnet, devoid 
of sillimanite, with minor amounts of or no biotite, as sug-
gested by pseudosections calculated with sedimentary bulk 
compositions (White &amp;amp; Powell 2002; White et al. 2007; 
Johnson et al. 2008).

The genesis of felsic granulite and garnet-cordierite dia-
texite is deeply associated with partial melting reactions, 
production of a melt phase, which was segregated, leaving 
behind different kinds of residues that, in turn, were controlled 
by different bulk compositions. The more fertile  composition 
produced large amounts of melt and a residue constituted 
of different amounts of cordierite and garnet from a pelite 
or an aluminum-rich greywacke. In any case, the protolith 

was richer in biotite than in sillimanite, since the latter min-
eral is observed only as an inclusion in cordierite or garnet, 
but never in the matrix. The less fertile felsic granulite pro-
duced a smaller amount of melt, evidenced by thin layers 
of orthopyroxene-bearing leucosome. In both cases, inde-
pendently of the amount of generated melt, a fair portion 
of it was segregated and, probably, lost, contributing to the 
generous magmatism observed in the area. This inference 
relies on the fact that, in both rock types, orthopyroxene, 
cordierite or garnet are preserved and only a small amount 
of grains present retrogression textures, as rim replacement 
by biotite-bearing symplectite. This kind of reaction texture 
is interpreted as the result of retrograde reaction between 
peritectic phases and entrapped melt (Kriegsman &amp;amp; Hensen 
1998). If no melt is lost, the peritectic phases should be 
completely consumed during cooling, as the stoichiometry 
ratio of produced phases along the progressive path is not 
changed. Therefore, all peritectic phases would react back 
with melt to produce reactant phases, as biotite, sillimanite, 
quartz and feldspars (White &amp;amp; Powell 2002). If fractions of 
produced melt are segregated and lost, only partial retrogres-
sion occurs, and preservation of peritectic phases is possible 
if all, or at least most, melt is segregated from the residue 
(Moraes et al. 2002; White &amp;amp; Powell 2002).

Considering an average crust with an intermediate bulk 
composition, between andesite and tonalite (Wedepohl 
1991), with density varying between 2.6 and 2.7 g/cm3, a 
depth of 25 to 26.5 km is needed to produce a lithostatic 
pressure of 7 kbar, of middle crust setting, leading to a gra-
dient of 32-34°C/km, which is a little higher than typical 
barrovian metamorphism, requiring a higher thermal gra-
dient that can be produced by incoming heat of contem-
poraneous granite intrusions.

DISCUSSION

Thermobarometry
The calculations made with THERMOCALC used the 

whole metamorphic peak mineral assemblage, and produced 
the most reliable P-T results, as they are more consistent

and have lower uncertainties, when compared to conven-
tional methods of thermobarometry. The most consistent 
P-T results for the investigated felsic granulites are 7 kbar 
and 850°C, calculated with low water activity, aH2O = 0.3. 
The results are in agreement with P-T calculations made for 
the garnet-cordierite diatexite. These conditions are compat-
ible with the orthopyroxene, cordierite and sillimanite sta-
bility fields for protoliths, respectively, of greywacke/granite 
and bulk pelite compositions. It is interesting to note that 
an optimum value of water activity could be found for the 
felsic granulite, as the lowest uncertainties and coherent P-T 
values were calculated, but for the garnet-cordierite diatex-
ite, water activity radically changes the values of calculated 
temperature, but does not influence too much the results 
of calculated pressure.

The P-T results obtained with conventional meth-
ods of thermobarometry, using garnet and orthopyroxene 
compositions, are somewhat ambiguous, either because 
low temperatures are calculated and are not compatible 
with the orthopyroxene stability field, or due to calculated 
high pressures, which are outside the stability field of cord-
ierite/sillimanite, present in the most abundant rock in the 
area, the garnet-cordierite diatexite. The calibrations done 
for the orthopyroxene and garnet pair, as thermometer or 
barometer, are based, respectively, on Fe-Mg and tschermak 
exchanges. Some were designed to work better for rocks 
where orthopyroxene presents high concentrations of alu-
minum. However, even the barometer calibrations are very 
sensitive to later Fe-Mg exchange, producing results that 
are not valid without corrections (Pattison &amp;amp; Bégin 1994; 
Fitzsimons &amp;amp; Harley 1994). Some of the problems may be 
related to expressions derived from experiments that were 
not truly reversed, producing imprecise expressions to cal-
culate pressure and temperature (Pattison 1994). Although 
both calibrations of the garnet-orthopyroxene barometer 
failed to produce reliable results, calculations run with the 
GAPES barometer yielded, within the uncertainties, results 
consistent with the ones calculated with THERMOCALC 
and are considered to have geological value.

P-T calculation for granulites using either conventional 
thermobarometry or THERMOCALC can result in equiv-
alent results, the reliability of which experiences the same 
constraints, i.e. late re-equilibrium between Fe and Mg or 
consumption of these phases due to the presence of trapped 
melt (Spear 1991; Spear &amp;amp; Florence 1992; White &amp;amp; Powell 
2002, 2010; Moraes et al. 2002; Pattison et al. 2003). For 
migmatites this might be an even harder and complex situ-
ation to investigate, because in many cases it becomes dif-
ficult to evaluate, based on the texture, if all phases were in 
chemical equilibrium during metamorphic peak, especially 
plagioclase and biotite, which can be crystallized from the 

trapped melt, but due to some late deformation, might look 
in textural equilibrium with other phases, which did not 
really coexist during the metamorphic peak. This problem 
can be accessed using a pseudosection that is a map of all 
mineral assemblages allowed by a determined bulk com-
position, inside a P-T window. However, the beauty of the 
method is also its doom, as it is necessary to know the orig-
inal protolith bulk composition, which for a migmatite is 
difficult, or even impossible. Therefore, it is necessary to use 
a hypothetical bulk composition or try to find a rock that 
is the low-grade equivalent of migmatite.

Sillimanite is clearly in petrographic disequilibrium 
with the metamorphic peak mineral assemblage. However, 
no good P-T calculation was possible without this mineral, 
given that it helps to balance and produce a larger amount 
of reactions, helping to produce a set of linear indepen-
dent reactions. Therefore, all P-T calculations done for the 
garnet-cordierite diatexite must be taken as, at least, sus-
picious. Adding sillimanite to the mineral assemblage will 
force THERMOCALC to calculate a point over the uni-
variant KFMASH reaction or inside a divariant field in the 
NCKFMASH field. This produces a minimum P-T con-
dition for the mineral assemblage of the garnet-cordierite 
diatexite. Consequently, all P-T calculations done for the 
felsic granulite produced more reliable results.

Tectonic implications 
of obtained results

As shown above, the study region underwent metamor-
phism and partial melting in a crust with a thermal gradi-
ent of 32 – 34°C/km, with metamorphic peak achieved at 
depths of 25 to 26.5 km. These conditions are somewhat 
higher than typical barrovian metamorphism, and probably 
imply a hot middle portion of thickened continental crust 
or lower portions of thinned crust. The mid crust is a more 
favorable tectonic setting, as studied rocks are inserted into 
the Araçuaí Orogen, a hot orogen in which several episodes 
of granite magmatism are recorded. It started with the G1 
pre-colisional suite, with ages spanning from 630 to 585 Ma; 
the G2 and G3 suites are constituted of S-type granites, with 
ages between 585 and 535 Ma, and are coeval to high-grade 
metamorphism, which involved formation of granulites and 
diatexites, investigated in this research; two post-collisional 
granite suites known as G4 suite also of S-type granite, and 
G5 suite, made of charnockites, both forming high sug-
ar-loafs in the region, crystallized between 520 and 490 Ma 
(see Gradim et al. 2014 and references therein). With such 
evolution, from granulite facies metamorphic peak to intru-
sion of later suites, including very hot charnockite magmas, 
a time span of almost 100 Ma is needed, and along all this 
time the mid crust was necessarily either hot or heated, at

Thermobarometry in migmatites and granulites



least twice, for metamorphic peak, and then for the forma-
tion of hot post-collisional granite magmas.

A significant portion of granulites is formed in middle 
to lower continental thickened crust in collisional tectonic 
settings, similar to the roots of the Himalayas (England &amp;amp; 
Thompson 1984; Ellis 1987; Harley 1989, 1992; Ashwall 
et al. 1992; Collins 2002; Jamieson et al. 2004). However, 
a major problem identified in such a tectonic setting is the 
lack of enough heat produced only by decay of radioactive 
elements, and another complimentary heat source is needed 
(England &amp;amp; Thompson 1984; Ellis 1987; Harley 1989, 1992; 
Ashwall et al. 1992; Jamieson et al. 1998). Several mod-
els are available: underplating of hot basalt magma (Wells 
1980; Elllis 1987; Bohlen 1987, 1991; Bohlen &amp;amp; Mezger 
1989); an additional layer of continental crust material 
rich in radioactive elements (TARM), subducted at mantle 
level (Jamieson et al. 1998); removal of a thermal bound-
ary layer due to convection of the asthenosphere, causing 
a huge thermal anomaly at the bottom of the orogen that 
will be followed by high-grade metamorphism, rising topog-
raphy, extensional collapse and granite and basalt magma-
tism (England 1994). Modern techniques are able to take 
into account a larger number of parameters, used to gener-
ate complex mathematical models, which are closer to real 
situations, presenting more consistent results than the early 
ones. Modeling for the Himalayan Orogeny solved the prob-
lem of heat source starting with a pre-heated crust and over-
thrusting hot migmatites over the down going rocks that 
were being heated due to collision, leading to partial melt-
ing and granulite facies conditions, with peak temperature 
over 900°C that are easily produced within the mountain 
chain (Jamieson et al. 2004). Nevertheless, in all the models, 
granulite facies conditions are achieved at pressure greater 
than 8 kbar and this is not in agreement with calculated 
P-T conditions for the investigated rocks and an alternative 
model must be considered, as well as a way to heat up the 
crust twice in the same tectonic event.

It is possible to pre-heat the continental crust in a back-
arc basin setting due to the movement of shallow mantle 
convection currents. Subsequent closure of the basin estab-
lishes an ideal setting to produce granites, migmatites and 
granulites, under medium pressure conditions (Hyndman 
et al. 2005). This model was proposed with great success to 
explain the evolution of the Araçuaí Orogen (Gradim 2013; 
Gradim et al. 2014). This type of tectonic setting encom-
passes the ideal characteristics for generation of most of the 
observed geology of the Araçuaí Orogen. The back-arc clo-
sure results in the edification of the orogen, induced by con-
tinental collision, followed by high-grade metamorphism, 
partial melting and granite magmatism, and later followed 
by the gravitational collapse of the orogen (Pedrosa-Soares 

et al. 2007). After this, the crust should be submitted to 
erosion and cooling in order to achieve isostatic equilib-
rium. This imposes a drawback to the model, as no heat 
source will be available to produce the younger G4 and G5 
suites, especially the last one constituted of very hot char-
nockite magma. Another heating event is needed. What is 
the cause for a new heating event to produce such import-
ant hot magmatism?

The tectonic switching model is based on alternating 
regimes of extension and contraction of continental crust, 
induced by changes in the angle of slab subduction that, in 
turn, is controlled by intermittent arrival of buoyant oce-
anic plateaus (Collins 2002). This is almost the base for the 
model proposed by Hyndman et al. (2005). However, as tec-
tonic switching may happen more than once, it offers the 
possibility of more than one heating stage in the same oro-
gen. In this model, cycles of flat to steep subduction result 
in episodes of crustal thickening followed by extension, and 
more than one event of high-grade metamorphism and par-
tial melting might be generated.

The tectonic switching model may enhance the Araçuaí 
Orogen evolution. The closure of a basin with a pre-heated 
crust producing high-grade metamorphism and partial 
melting (G2 and G3 suites) during crustal thickening is fol-
lowed by flat subduction, induced by basalt plateau entering 
into the subduction zone that will cause a stage of tectonic 
quiescence. After the plateau is subducted, the subduction 
slab changes to a steeper regime, causing tectonic roll-back, 
crust extension, advection of hot asthenosphere that during 
decompression produces basaltic magma and a thermal 
anomaly at the base of the continental crust, after the first 
main metamorphism and magmatism event. A new high-
grade metamorphic event associated with extensive granite 
and charnockite magma production takes place in a younger 
period, represented by the G4 and G5 suites. The effect of 
this later extension caused by tectonic switching should 
not be different from a gravitational collapse produced by 
removal of the thermal boundary layer as proposed in other 
models (England 1994). The advantage of tectonic switching 
is the possibility of a new heating event later in the orogen 
evolution, producing extensive magmatism, with contribu-
tion from mantle and crustal sources. It also should produce 
another high-grade metamorphic event, with the same age 
as G4 and G5 suites, which is not reported so far, but might 
be a nice possibility for future investigations.

Although the tectonic switching model may explain the 
time spam between main metamorphism/G2-G3 Granite 
Suites and later G4 and G5 Suites, it requires a longer period 
of subduction. As the Araçuaí Orogen is semi-confined, the 
nutcracker tectonic model was proposed and it explains most 
of the features observed (Alkmim et al. 2006), however it

does not require extensive subduction of oceanic crust and 
it opposes with the tectonic switching. Another point that 
must be evaluated is how far the change in the subduction 
angle can affect the inner portions of the orogen, because 
rocks of the Jequitinhonha Complex lay on the ensialic 
portion of the Araçuaí Orogen, in its innermost portion. 
Although the tectonic switching model can explain some 
features, it is not perfect, but it is an interesting option to 
be further investigated.

CONCLUSIONS

In southern Bahia, granulites and migmatites of the 
Jequitinhonha Complex constitute an important portion 
of the Araçuaí Orogen (Sampaio et al. 2004). These rocks 
underwent granulite facies metamorphism with meta-
morphic peak conditions of 850°C and 7 kbar. Assorted 
methods to calculate P-T conditions were used and opti-
mal thermobarometry using THERMOCALC produced 
a more consistent set of results. This method also brings 
the advantage to be able to investigate the presence, 
composition and influence of the fluid phase. For the 
garnet-cordierite diatexite, a water rich fluid produces 
better results, but for the felsic granulite a fluid with 
water activity of 0.3 yielded the most consistent statis-
tical values for pressure and temperature. These results 
are also compatible with the stability field of the mineral 
assemblage constituted of garnet + cordierite + orthoclase 
+ quartz coexisting with a melt phase, as well as with 

orthopyroxene + garnet + plagioclase + quartz, respec-
tively, in garnet-cordierite diatexite and felsic granulite. 
Even if the value of 8 kbar, produced by conventional 
barometry, is used, it is also compatible with observed 
mineral assemblages. These P-T conditions are also in 
agreement with the KFMASH melting reaction of sil-
limanite + biotite, in presence of quartz and feldspars, 
which was the reaction crossed by pelites to produce the 
garnet-cordierite diatexite that dominates the geology of 
this region (Sampaio et al. 2004).

The calculated P-T conditions are compatible with tec-
tonic settings of the middle crust with high geothermal gra-
dient, which matches either a magmatic arc setting or por-
tions of back-arc basin, as proposed before for these rocks 
(Noce et al. 2004; Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2006; Silva et al. 
2008; Roncato 2009; Gradim 2013; Gradim et al. 2014). 
The tectonic switching model enhances the Araçuaí Orogen 
evolution in comparison with previous proposals, as it can 
explain the time gap between main metamorphism and 
associated G2 suite with later and hot G4 and G5 suites.
