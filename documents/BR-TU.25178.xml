ABSTRACT

The well productivity in crystalline terrains is extremely changeable and depends on external factors, in addition to

the intrinsic properties of rocks. In the Jundiaí River Catchment, Southeastern Brazil, the main factor that influences

well productivity is the existence of open discontinuities permeability in geologic environments that favor groundwater

recharge. In that area, Pre-Cambrian shear and fault zones were reactivated throughout geologic time, controlling

the morphostructural compartments and the Cenozoic sedimentary deposition. Superposition of productivity data and

structural maps showed that more productive wells are concentrated mainly along the regional geologic structures. The

structural control over well productivity is also noticeable in detailed scale. Using fine scale maps we show that the

most productive wells are located in areas where brittle structures with NW– SE and E– W directions denote the action

of neotectonic transtensional stress. The comprehension of evolutionary geologic history allied to fracturing analysis

proved to be an efficient and a low cost technique, which is adequate for selecting areas for further developments using

more expensive methods.

Key words: groundwater, crystalline rocks, tectonics, Jundiaí, Southeastern Brazil.

INTRODUCTION

The industrialization in Southeastern Brazil, allied to

a lack of investments in water resources management,

brought the unbalance between water supply and water

demand, particularly in the neighborhood of São Paulo

Metropolitan Area, as the one studied in this report. This

situation led to an increasing quest for groundwater,

despite the unfavorable conditions of the geologic sub-

stratum. Most of the area is located in the crystalline

basement, where groundwater behavior is complex and

still is not very well understood.

The hydraulic behavior of the aquifers that occur in

crystalline terrains is extremely variable and depends on

the presence of rock discontinuities, among other factors.

Many approaches have been developed to understand

the variations of well productivity in crystalline terrains

by defining a factor or a group of factors that influences

groundwater flow (e.g. Le Grand 1954, Siddiqui and

Parizek 1971, Yin and Brook 1992, Briz-Kishore 1993,

Henriksen 1995, Mabee et al. 1994, Knopman and Hol-

lyday 1996). The lithotype, the presence of sedimentary

cover and/or weathering layer, the geologic structures,

the tectonics and in situ tension are between the most

studied factors.

In the Jundiaí River Catchment, the structural con-

trol on well productivity is pronounced, although influ-

ences of other factors may also exist (Neves 2005). In

the present study we investigate the structural control

through the analysis of well productivity variation ac-

cording to the position of geologic structures, in regional

and local scales. The Jundiaí River Catchment offers

excellent opportunities for these studies due to the pres-

ence of geologic structures reactivated by tectonic events

that control the landforms and the formation of sedimen-

tary deposits. Furthermore, the occurrence of sedimen-

tary coverings in the crystalline basement allows for the

definition of geologic evolution and permits the identifi-

cation of neotectonic activity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Well data compiled by Neves (2005) were obtained from

the governmental agency responsible for water manage-

ment in São Paulo State, the DAEE – Departamento

de Águas e Energia Elétrica (Water and Electric En-

ergy Department), from the CPRM – Serviço Geológico

Nacional (National Geologic Survey) and from a well-

drilling company. Only the wells that have measures

of static level, dynamic level and pumping rate, besides

co-ordinates for their location, were considered. The

study relies on data from 590 wells that exploit the Crys-

talline Aquifer System, 33 wells that exploit the Tubarão

Aquifer System and 25 that exploit both.

The specific capacity (m3/h/m) was used in this

work as the measure of well productivity. It is deter-

mined from a test that involves pumping a well at a con-

stant rate and measuring the resulting drawdown in water

level (Mace 1997). Such measure has been adopted as

a representative parameter of well productivity (Berta-

chini 1988, Chilton and Foster 1995) and is also known

as “ Q/s”.

The study was conducted in two ways: in regional

scale, involving all the Jundiaí River Catchment and

neighborhood, and in local scale, through the investi-

gation of cases in several selected areas.

For the regional scale analysis (1:250,000), the sim-

ple planar surface was used to calculate the residuals map

of specific capacity. The simple planar surface is de-

fined as the surface that best fix to a group of mapped data

and the residuals constitute local variations that deviate

from the regional tendency toward negative or positive

values, which are used for anomalies detection (Agter-

berg 1974, Davis 1986, Landim 2003). Thereby, the

most productive wells appear in the residuals map as el-

evated positive residuals. These maps were superposed

to the lineaments and regional structures maps in order

to detect possible correlations by visual inspection.

The methodologies proposed by Liu (1987) and

Wise (1982) were pursued for tracing lineaments, mak-

ing use of radar imagery and aerial photographs. The

term “ lineament” was adopted according to O’ Leary et

al. (1976), who consider a lineament as a simple or com-

posed linear feature whose parts are aligned in a recti-

linear or curvilinear way, which differ from the adjacent

feature patterns presumably as a reflex of a sub-superfi-

cial phenomenon.

In the local scale study (1:50,000), some areas were

selected according to the availability of well and struc-

tural data collected in survey works or extracted from

thematic maps. The explanations to the “ productivity

anomalies”, i.e., to the situations where highly produc-

tive wells are close to lowly productive or unproduc-

tive wells, were investigated by constructing geologic-

structural sections. Wells considered as “ lowly produc-

tive” have specific capacity smaller than 0.05 m3/h/m

and the “ highly productive” ones have specific capacity

greater than or equal to 0.5 m3/h/m.

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE STUDY AREA

The study area constitutes a rectangular polygon that in-

volves all the Jundiaí River Catchment, between 46?30?
and 47?20? W Gr. and 23?00? and 23?20? S (Figure 1).
This basin is located less than 100 km from the At-

lantic coast, but the mountains of the Atlantic Plateau

direct the drainage towards inland. The Jundiaí River

begins in the Serra da Mantiqueira (Mantiqueira Moun-

tain Range), where the altitudes vary from 1,000 to 1,200

meters above sea level, and ends up in the Tietê River, in

altitudes of approximately 550 meters (São Paulo 2000).

The area of the basin is about 1,114 km2 and its main trib-

utaries are the Jundiaí-Mirim River and the Piraí Stream.

GEOLOGIC AND HYDROGEOLOGIC SETTING

Most of the catchment is located on the crystalline or

Pre-Cambrian basement area (Figure 2a). Rocks of the

Amparo Complex predominate, composed mainly of

gneiss with intercalations of quartzites, schists and am-

phibolites (Hasui et al. 1981). In the southern part of

the area, rocks of the São Roque Domain occur, which

is constituted mainly by phyllites with intercalations of

quartzites and calc-silicate rocks, beyond schists, meta-

cherts and marbles (Juliani and Beljavskis 1995). Grani-

tic intrusions are very common for both units.

The Crystalline Aquifer System is composed of

Pre-Cambrian basement units (Figure 2b) and, therefore,

its permeability depends on the occurrence of disconti-

nuities such as faults and joints and, sometimes, litho-

logic contacts (Neves 2005). Over the fractured rock, the

weathering layer can form an aquifer of granular poros-

ity, responsible by the most part of the catchment base

flow (M.F.C. Lopes, unpublished data).

Sedimentary rocks of Paleozoic age belonging to

Itararé Group occupy the west side of the area, in the

Paraná Sedimentary Basin (Figure 2a), where compose

the Tubarão Aquifer System (Figure 2b). The influence

of glacial climate in the genesis of these rocks gives

heterogeneous characteristics to them, as the vertical and

horizontal compositional variability, which induces low

permeability and limited potentiality to the aquifer

(Stevaux et al. 1987, Diogo et al. 1984). Even where

sandstone layers are considerably thick, there is a great

variability of specific capacity of wells due to the layers

discontinuity (A.C. Vidal, unpublished data).

Alluvial Quaternary deposits, that occupy the allu-

vial plain along the main rivers (Neves et al. 2005a), com-

pose the Cenozoic Aquifer System (Figure 2b). Other

sedimentary Cenozoic deposits are also present but do

not form aquifers due to their restrict occurrence, just

covering tops and hill slopes. These are the Tertiary de-

posits – that registry an ancient alluvial fan system orig-

inated from Japi Mountain Range – and the colluvial-

elluvial deposits – spread along the hills (Neves et al.

2005b) (Figure 2a).

STRUCTURAL AND TECTONIC SETTING

Ductile shear zones and faults with regional extension

(Figure 2a) compartment the area in tectonic blocks,

control the relief, the deposition of sediments and the

configuration of the Jundiaí River Catchment (Neves et

al. 2003). The Jundiuvira Shear Zone (Figure 2a) has

NE– SW direction that inflects to E– W, and the Itu, Pi-

raí, Cururu and Cachoeira faults have NW– SE direction

that also inflects to E– W (Hasui et al. 1978). The Va-

linhos and Campinas shear zones (Brasil 1979, S.R.F.

Vlach 1985, unpublished data) are also important in this

area and cross by the Jundiaí River Catchment following

NNE– SSW to NE– SW directions (Neves 2005). The Ex-

trema Shear Zone, with the same direction, cut the east

side of the area, in the Atibaia region.

Such structures, inherited from the Pre-Cambrian,

arose under ductile conditions and developed outstand-

ing mylonitic foliation and mineral remobilization.

Throughout geologic time, the conditions became more

and more brittle, but the tectonic tensions continued

being alleviated along those regional geologic structures.

In other words, the Pre-Cambrian structures acted as

crustal weakness zones during all the geologic evolution

of the area.

From this evolutionary history it is important to de-

fine two main tectonic phases, which understanding is

fundamental to this work: the extensional regime that

acted in the Gondwana break-up and the transcurrent

neotectonic regime that came later.

The extensional regime, that culminated with the

continental separation, had a regional tensor with ?1 ver-

tical, ?2 NE– SW horizontal and ?3 NW– SE horizontal

(Figure 3a). Under this arrangement, normal faults and

open joints arise predominantly in NE– SW direction and

there is tendency of opening in discontinuities with NE–

SW direction inherited from the Pre-Cambrian.

This extensional regime progressively was substi-

tuted by a transcurrent regime linked to the rotation of

the South-American Plate to the West, process that has

been defined as a neotectonic event (e.g. Hasui 1990,

Saadi 1993, Riccomini and Assumpção 1999). Some di-

vergences exist in the literature about the neotectonic

deformational events, but there is an agreement with re-

spect to the existence of a transcurrent dextral phase,

that would be unique or, at least, very important. Under

this regime, a conjugated pair of tensions acts along the

E– W direction (Figure 3b) and tends to form open dis-

continuities in NW– SE direction and transcurrent dextral

faults in E– W direction, between other structures.

sional regime, that acted from Upper Cretaceous up to the Paleogene

VARIATION OF WELL PRODUCTIVITY IN
REGIONAL SCALE

Superposition of the lineament and structural maps and

the residual maps of specific capacity were done sepa-

rately to wells that exploit the Crystalline Aquifer Sys-

tem, the Tubarão Aquifer System and both systems. The

positive residuals show places that correspond to more

productive wells, that are detached relating to others,

i.e., they indicate productivity anomalies.

PRODUCTIVITY AND LINEAMENTS

In the Crystalline Aquifer System, association between

productivity anomalies and lineament density is not ob-

servable, neither to that traced in regional scale nor to

that traced in more detailed scale (Figure 4). The same

occur with the wells that exploit the Tubarão Aquifer

System and with the wells that exploit both the aquifers

(Figure 5).

In those areas with low lineaments density, the sed-

imentary covers generally are present and the weather-

ing layer tends to be thicker. Thus, the lineaments be-

come disguised and cannot be observed in the remote

sensing images. However, where the fracture density is

greater, the rocks are easily attacked by weathering and,

depending on their original composition, highly perme-

able material can be formed. Therefore, one could expect

the presence of positive residuals in locations where low

lineaments density occur.

PRODUCTIVITY AND REGIONAL STRUCTURES

The superposition of specific capacity residual maps and

the map of faults and shear zones show close associative

relations between some productivity anomalies and the

structural traces (Figure 6).

The most prominent point with positive residual

value occurs close to the Cachoeira Fault. Similarly,

there are points of positive anomalies throughout the

Valinhos Shear Zone, in its intersection with the Cu-

ruru Fault, in the Campinas Shear Zone and next the Itu

Fault. Between the faults with NW– SE direction that

control the scarps of the Jardim Mountain Range, and

throughout there, points with high positive residuals can

also be seen.

Points with high productivity unlinked to the trace

of regional structures exist only in two regions. One of

them is the central portion of the area and the other is

southward to the Jundiuvira Shear Zone. The last one

is associated to the presence of the carbonatic metassed-

iments of the São Roque Domain, which have an im-

portant hole in high well yields (Neves 2005). On the

other hand, the positive anomalies located in the central

region are due to the morphostructural compartments.

Central region is relatively depressed and surrounded by

the mountains that delimitate the Jundiaí River Catch-

ment and by the structural barrier of Itu granitic massive

(Neves et al. 2003).

The positive productivity anomalies of wells that

exploit the Tubarão Aquifer System and that exploit

both aquifers also have a notable association with the

regional structures (Figure 7). The points with high posi-

tive residuals are associated to the Campinas Shear

Zone, which crosses the area in NNE– SSW direction.

Although the Tubarão Aquifer System is a porous aquifer,

the structural control also plays an important hole. In-

deed, springs were detected along joints that affect sand-

stones of the Tubarão Group (Neves 2005).

VARIATION OF WELL PRODUCTIVITY IN LOCAL SCALE

Although there is a close association between the re-

gional geologic structures and the presence of highly

productive wells, the analysis in local scale (1:50,000 or

more) show that even in the areas where highly produc-

tive wells occur, other wells with low productivity also

exist. The heterogeneity of the fractured rock gives rise

to situations where one well cross a productive fractured

zone meanwhile other, next to it, cross the massive rock.

Several similar cases were identified in the studied

area. In most of them the median specific capacity (con-

sidering all wells) is superior to the median calculated

for the sample that exploit the Crystalline Aquifer Sys-

tem of the area as a whole (Q/smed = 0.07 m
3/h/m). In

all of these areas, the presence of lineaments and struc-

tures with NW– SE and E– W directions is striking. Three

typical examples are presented below.

HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE WELLS FROM CABREÚ VA

In the Cabreúva region, there are gneisses, migmatites,

quartizites and granites of the crystalline basement, as

well as Cenozoic colluvial-elluvial and alluvial deposits

(Figure 8). The Piraí Fault, in the NW– SE direction and

other structures in E– W and N– S directions cut this area.

Although the Piraí fault appears as a simple trace, it is, in

fact, a fault zone of changeable thickness, dipping with

high angle towards southwest. The structures with E–

W directions also have high dip angle and form fracture

zones that intercept the NW– SE and N– S discontinuities

in sites where accumulation of alluvial sediments occur.

The median specific capacity of wells in this area

is equal to 0.08 m3/h/m, greater than the median specific

capacity calculated to the area as a whole by one order

of magnitude. To analyze the structural influence in the

spatial variation of productivity, the wells number 626,

630 and 2580/99 were selected, the first one with spe-

cific capacity equal to 0.56 m3/h/m and the two others

with specific capacity of 0.05 and 0.04 m3/h/m, respec-

tively. The geological sections illustrated in the Figure 8

show the 626 well crossing, in subsurface, the structures

with NW– SE and E– W directions, which provide the

high productivity to the well. The wells number 630 and

An Acad Bras Cienc (2007) 79 (2)



STRUCTURAL CONTROL OVER WELL PRODUCTIVITY IN THE JUNDIAÍ RIVER CATCHMENT 315

2580/99 are located near the same structures, but do not

intercept the main structures in depth and, consequently,

their productivities are low.

HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE WELLS FROM JACARÉ DISTRICT

Another similar case was identified in the Jacaré Dis-

trict, near the Marechal Rondon Highway (Figure 9).

Two important structures cross this area: the Cururu

Fault, with NW– SE direction and high dip to SW, and

the Valinhos Shear Zone, with NNE– SSW direction and

also high dip to ESE. There are E– W structures, which

control Cenozoic deposits occurrences, as well as N– S

structures that control the relief dissection giving rise to

ravines with the same direction.

In this place, the median specific capacity of wells is

equal to 0.05 m3/h/m, minor than the median specific ca-

pacity of wells in the crystalline. But one of the wells has

high productivity: the well number 301/48, with specific

capacity equal to 1.61 m3/h/m. The other two selected

wells have low productivity: the well number 81, with

0.03 m3/h/m and the well number 44, with 0.04 m3/h/m.

The geological sections (Figure 9) show that, even lo-

cated near similar lineaments, the productivity are very

different depending on the location relating to the geo-

logic structures in subsurface.

HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE WELLS FROM LOUVEIRA

The third case involves the Louveira County, where gran-

ites and gneisses of Amparo Complex, alluvial deposits

in the Capivari river alluvial plain and colluvial-elluvial

deposits along of its margins coexist (Figure 10). A high

number of wells exist in this area, whose median specific

capacity is equal to 0.15 m3/h/m, almost two times the

median of the Crystalline System of the whole area. This

case stands out by the presence of E– W and NW– SE lin-

eaments and, furthermore, a ramification of the Valinhos

Shear Zone crossing the area in NNE– SSW direction.

Geological sections were constructed in two loca-

tions where four wells in situations clearly controlled by

structures are present (Figure 10). The wells number 711

and 727 have productivity considered high (specific ca-

pacities of 1.22 and 1.17 m3/h/m, respectively) and the

wells number 737 and 6570 demonstrate low productiv-

ity (0.17 and 0.02 m3/h/m).

DISCUSSION

Statistic correlations between productivity of wells and

their distance to lineaments, length of lineaments, den-

sity of lineaments or number of lineament intersections

is a common method used to evaluate the chances of

finding groundwater in crystalline terrains (e.g. Hard-

castle 1995, Loiselle and Evans 1995, Mayer and Sharp

1998). However, some authors emphasize that an in-

trinsic subjectivity of lineament tracing does exist (Wise

1982, Tam et al. 2004). Others suggest applying “ re-

producibility tests” by selecting just the traces that two

or more professionals consider as lineaments (Mabee et

al. 1994, Sander et al. 1997).

In addition, the structural characterization of the

features that are revealed in the lineaments, such as their

typology, the dip angle and other particular characteris-

tics is of fundamental importance. In the studied area,

the simple superposition of maps was capable to show

that correlations between positive productivity anoma-

lies and the density of lineaments do not exist in both of

the applied scales (Figures 4 and 5). The reason for this

is that the sedimentary covering and the thick weathering

layer can mask the geologic structures of the underlying

basement and, consequently, the different lineament den-

sities that one observe in the remote sensing imagery do

not necessarily reflect the fracturing rate of the geologic

substratum. Otherwise, one important characteristics of

this area is the conspicuous contrast between landforms

with sedimentary cover and pediments beside of others

with exposed rocks and rough relief. The first ones tend

to show low lineament density and, according to Sing-

hal and Gupta (1999), greater capacity for groundwater

supplying.

The study in regional scale show that the specific

capacity anomalies tend to occur besides the regional

structures represented by the shear zones and the fault

zones that delineate the morphostructural compartments.

One fact that reaffirms the influence of these structures

in the groundwater flow at relatively high depths is the

presence of thermal water springs along the Valinhos

Shear Zone registered by Hasui et al. (1989). The as-

sociation between highly productive wells and regional

structures that are similar to the ones that occur in the

studied area (NW– SE and NNE– SSW directions) was

also identified in the Campinas region by Fernandes and

Rudolph (2001), who considered them as opened by

neotectonic events.

Gustafsson and Krásn? (1994) affirm that inten-

sively fractured zones, with dozens kilometers in exten-

sion, can form great hydraulic conductors, meanwhile

other authors call attention to the fact that not always

regional structures are in fact the most productive (e.g.

Banks et al. 1992, Nilsen 1998). The discontinuity fill-

ing would be an important factor in this case, because

the major fractured zones tend to develop clayey filling

by the alteration of fragmented material. But the kind

of filling depends on the original material and, if the

rock is rich in quartz, as granites, gneiss and quartzites,

which are abundant in the studied area, the altered ma-

terial can be highly permeable (Davis and Turk 1964,

Singhal and Gupta 1999, Neves 2005).

Although the existence of fractures is a fundamen-

tal factor to defining well productivity in crystalline ter-

rain, certain characteristics such as their aperture should

be favorable to groundwater flow (Lachassagne et al.

2001, Banks et al. 1996, Banks and Robins 2002). The

formation of open discontinuities and/or the opening of

pre-existent discontinuities occur according to the orien-

tation of the major horizontal tectonic tension. In this

way, the effects of the extensional tectonic in NE– SW

structures and the transtensional effects of the transcur-

rent tectonic in NW– SE structures are of a prime impor-

tance to groundwater flow in the fractured rock, mainly

if they are associated to others of E– W directions.

However, the fact that one structure is favorable to

percolation of water does not indicate that it is related

to neotectonic tension action. Older structures can also

remain opened through geologic time, especially in in-

traplate setting, where tectonic tensions are smaller than

in plate borders.

CONCLUSIONS

The morphostructural compartment limits, marked by

shear zones and regional faults, are favorable sites to

obtain productive wells. Nevertheless, the wells should

be located favorably to the structural dip and, further, the

structures should be originally opened or submitted to

extensional tensions during tectonic reactivations.

According to the fracturing analysis and the defini-

tion of geologic evolution, the geological structures po-

tentially opened have NE– SW direction (fracture zones

associated to the extensional tectonic that worked from

the final of Mesozoic to the beginning of Tertiary), NW–

SE direction (normal faults and open fractures formed or

reactivated by the neotectonic event) and E– W direction

(very important when associated to the NW– SE struc-

tures, that characterize transtensional zones).

Associated to the geologic evolution study, the

structural analysis can be used to indicate the structures

or the areas that provide higher chances of obtaining pro-

ductive wells. For a precise location of wells, the studies

in regional scale are necessary and are as important as

the study in detailed scale.

RESUMO

A produtividade dos poços tubulares profundos em terrenos

cristalinos é extremamente variável e depende, além das pro-

priedades intrínsecas da rocha, de fatores externos a ela. Na

bacia do rio Jundiaí, Região Sudeste do Brasil, a existência de

descontinuidades abertas em situações geológicas favoráveis à

recarga constitui o principal fator que influencia a produtivi-

dade dos poços. Nesta área, zonas de cisalhamento e zonas de

falhas pré-cambrianas reativadas ao longo do tempo geológico

controlam a compartimentação morfoestrutural e a deposição

de sedimentos cenozóicos. O cruzamento do mapa estrutu-

ral com os dados dos poços que explotam o Sistema Aqüífero

Cristalino mostrou que poços com produtividade elevada em

relação aos demais concentram-se ao longo das estruturas re-

gionais. O forte controle estrutural sobre a produtividade dos

poços também é notável em escala de detalhe. Nesta escala,

constatou-se que os poços mais produtivos situam-se em áreas

onde estruturas rúpteis de direção NW– SE e E– W denotam a

ação de esforços transtrativos neotectônicos. A compreensão

da história evolutiva aliada à análise do fraturamento mostrou

ser uma técnica eficiente e de baixo custo, conveniente para ser
