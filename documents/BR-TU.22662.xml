International Workshop on Microeconomics

Applied to the Energy Industry

December 15th, 2011

Aghion, Quesada (Harvard, UTDT) Petroleum Contracts Rio de Janeiro Dec 15, 2011 1 / 23



Introduction

Increases in oil prices led to expropriations of oil and gas companies by
countries.

Sizable expropriations like Bolivia and Venezuela.

More subtle: Increase in corporate (sectoral) tax rates like England.

What we do:

Describe the main characteristics of petroleum contracts.

Use contract theory to rationalize those contractual forms.

Try to understand why governments may be justified to renege on past

agreements.

Prevailing contracts between countries and oil

companies

Production Sharing Agreements (PSA).

Concession Contracts.

Risk Service Agreements: Company supplies services and know-how to

the State in exchange for a fee. It bears all the exploration costs. The

State remains the owner of the produced oil.

Joint Ventures: Ownership of the production is specified by the

participation of the company and the government on the venture.

Government is entitled to a share of profits, but it also bears a share of

development and operation costs.

Contracting Model

Two parties to the contract: Company (C) and State (G).

3 periods: t = 0, contracting and exploration; t = 1, 2, production.

Contract assigns control rights and a profit sharing rule.

To start exploration: sunk, non-contractible investment I.

An oil reserve is discovered with probability q(I).

Size of the reserve R is observed by both parties but not verifiable.

Production in period t requires a non-contractible effort et , which costs

?(et, I). Production costs = 0.

Production is yt is random. Depends on effort: Higher effort increases the

probability of higher production.

Prices are unknown at t = 0 but known before production.

Company pays income taxes at a rate equal to it .

Moral Hazard and Risk Sharing

When effort is not observable, if company does not fully appropriate the

benefits of effort ? it exerts inefficiently low levels of effort.

Sources of uncertainty:

Existence, size and quality of the reserve unknown before exploration.

Drilling costs depend on the unknown characteristics of the field.

Government owns the resources under the surface: risk of expropriations or

contract renegotiations.

Large companies drill wells in different locations ? Diversify risk. Can be
thought of as (almost) risk neutral.

Hence, avoid MH by making the firm residual claimant.

Drilling costs depend on the unknown characteristics of the field.

Government owns the resources under the surface: risk of expropriations or

contract renegotiations.

Large companies drill wells in different locations ? Diversify risk. Can be
thought of as (almost) risk neutral.

Hence, avoid MH by making the firm residual claimant.

Moral Hazard and Risk Sharing: Contractual

Provisions

A concession contract with surface royalties makes the firm residual

claimant ? guarantees efficient effort at production stage.

Not true under PSA ?
Contracts include work programs with commitments in terms of drilling and

production.

This calls for monitoring effort from the State.

Assets Specificity and Hold-up: Framework

Hart and Moore (1988): Suppose that

Parties have to make sunk relationship-specific investments.

Outcome is difficult to describe at the contractual stage (non-contractible).

Contract can be renegotiated once the outcome becomes observable.

Then,

Parties are exposed to opportunistic behavior (hold-up): share the

benefits of the investment with the other party.

Parties lower their initial investment.

Assets Specificity and Hold-up

Investments in oil exploration I are large and highly specific in nature.

Company is in charge of this investment in all existing contractual

arrangements.

Exposed to opportunistic behavior and hold-up once a discovery is made.

Usually through adjustments in the tax system.

Idea: It is ex-post optimal for the government to increase the tax rate

when I is large.

Hence, company invests less than the efficient level.

Make the state a partner in the exploration phase (share the costs):

Make exploration costs deductible from income-taxes.

State reimburses part of the exploration costs.

Assign residual control rights to C (Grossman and Hart, 1986):

Stabilization clause: State commits not to change its laws.

Allow the company to sell all its share of oil in the international market (avoid

hold-up through exchange-rate policy).

Appropriate renegotiation design (Aghion, Dewatripont and Rey, 1994):

Renegotiation clause that makes explicit the conditions for renegotiations.

Duration of the contract structured in short-term phases. Company can

opt-out at the end of each phase.

Poor Enforcement: Framework

Suppose that

There is a probability that the contract will not be fully enforced in the
future.

This probability is likely to be increasing in the company‚Äôs profits (higher

when prices are higher).

Expropriations or unilateral change of terms of the contract (increased

royalties or reduced share of profit-oil).

Then,

Company loses part (or all) of its assets ? reduces the expected returns
of the investment.

Implicitly increases the company‚Äôs discount factor (values the present

relatively more, while the contract is still enforced).

Poor Enforcement

Main problem: Find an impartial third party within the country‚Äôs judiciary

system.

Important issue: Reserves under the soil are property of the State.

This creates sovereign risk: unilaterally changing the terms of the

contract or expropriating.

Enforcement problems (say, possibility of expropriation) are associated
with:

Inefficiently low levels of initial investment (I).

Too quick extraction rates: Early extraction.

Safeguard clauses to create mechanisms to resolve disputes (improve

Disputes to be solved outside the State‚Äôs judiciary system. Credible and fair

third party to mediate: International Commercial Arbitration.

Which law governs the oil contract? In general, the host State law.

Sometimes, a combination of international law and the host State law.

Highly progressive income taxes (reduce temptation).

Extra contractual tools:

Reputation concerns on the State‚Äôs side: Compliance improves future

contract terms. Loses power if government worry only about short-term.

Threat of not reinvesting in the country by the company. May lose power

once oil has been found (easy to find a replacement).

Ex-post Uncertainty and Grievance: Framework

Hart and Moore (2008): Contractual performance depends upon the

agreement that are not ex-ante contractible.

Performance ‚Äúwithin the letter of the contract‚Äù (enforceable) vs.

performance ‚Äúwithin the spirit of the contract‚Äù (non-enforceable).

Contract works as a reference point for the parties‚Äô perceptions of

entitlement.

Party who gets less than what he/she feels entitled to, reduces ex-post

cooperation (provides only enforceable performance).

Then

Under certainty, rigid contracts are efficient (no room for grievance).

With uncertainty: trade-off between rigidity and flexibility.

Ex-post Uncertainty and Grievance

How can parties who feel aggrieved reduce ex-post cooperation?

Company:

Cutting quality of the oil delivered.

Delaying payment of royalties.

State:

Performing excessive controls.

Changing regulations.

Generating hostile feeling among the population about foreign firms.

Generate inefficiencies in multiple aspects of the contract execution.

Ex-post Uncertainty and Grievance: Contractual

Under uncertainty, rigid contracts often call for renegotiations:

Size of the reserve is low and company wants to renegotiate.

Oil quality is very high and the State wants to renegotiate.

Make the contract more flexible to reduce this renegotiation-type
grievance.

Flexibility in concession contracts: Progressive royalty scheme based on

some profitability indicators.

Flexibility in PSAs through non-linear schemes for sharing profit-oil.

Governments often care only about the short-term.

long run.

Even under certainty the country may feel aggrieved ex-post.

May justify expropriations.

Conclusions

Contract theory is useful to explain the evolution of petroleum contracts.

Moral hazard: Inefficiently low effort levels ? Work programs and
monitoring effort.

Hold-up: Inefficiently low initial investments ? Commitment clauses and
renegotiation rules.

Enforcement problems: Inefficiently low investment and too quick

extraction rates ? International commercial arbitration and contract law;
reputation and threat of not reinvesting.

Uncertainty and grievance: Inefficient compliance ? Increased flexibility.

Add short-termist governments: Renege on previous agreements

(expropriations).
