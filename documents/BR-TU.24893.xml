Keywords Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), activated sludge, waste streams,
aerobic dynamic feeding (ADF), volatile fatty acids (VFA), 1,2-
propylene carbonate, hydrogen

Abstract Polyhydroxybutyrate is a type of biodegradable plastic,
fully synthesized by bacteria, with similar properties to the ones
of conventional plastics. This biopolymer can be produced by
mixed cultures (activated sludge form waste water treatment
plants) using the volatile fatty acids present in waste streams.
Although the huge potential of this process, its application for
the industrial production of PHB still lacks development.

Throughout this work, three different strategies to obtain
PHB-producing bacteria by using waste streams were tested. In
the first one PHB-producing bacteria were first selected by
aerobic dynamic feeding conditions, while simultaneously
providing hydrogen gas, followed by an accumulation stage. In
the second strategy the conventional aerobic dynamic feeding
conditions were imposed, followed by an accumulation stage.
And a third one, where a mixed culture was straightly submitted
to the accumulation stage, without previous selection. Aerobic
dynamic feeding was operated in cycles og 8 hours (3 cycles
per day). In the first two strategies, feast phase was intended to
last 2h30 and the famine 5h30 for a feast/famine ratio of 0.45.
While the accumulation stage lasted 22 hours.

High biomass concentration were achieved using strategy
1, in a stable reactor, and it was possible to accumulate PHB up
to 59 % of the VSS with a PHB production yield of 0.30 g SLB/g
COD fed. The second strategy resulted in less stable rectors,
and  a PHB content of 40 % of the VSS was achieved, but with
PHB production yields as low as 0.09 g PHB/ g COD.
Furthermore, it was no always possible to produce PHB as
carbon source seemed to be directed to other metabolic
pathways. A PHB production yields of 0.31 g PHB/g COD
consumed was achieved with the third strategy, although only
with a PHB content of 21 % of VSS.

The production of PHB was verified firstly by a
thermogravimetric method developed at Avecom previously to
this work. This method was replaced by other that comprises the
extraction of PHB using 1,2 propylene carbonate as solvent.
The development of this method is also addressed in this
project.

Palavras-chave Polihidroxibutirato (PHB), lamas activadas, efluentes,
alimentação dinâmica aeróbia (ADF), ácidos orgânicos voláteis
(AOV), carbonato de propileno, hidrogénio

Resumo Polihidroxibutirato é um tipo de plástico biodegradável,
completamente sintetizado por bactérias, com propriedades
semelhantes aos plásticos convencionais. Este biopolímero
pode ser produzito por culturas mistas (lamas ativadas de
estações  de tratamento de águas) usando os ácidos orgânicos
voláteis presentes no efluente. Embora este processo apresente
um enorme potencial,  ainda é necessário o seu
desenvolvimento para a sua aplicação na produção de PHB a
escala industrial.

Durante este trabalho, foram testadas três estratégias
diferentes para a seleção de bactérias produtoras de PHB forma
testadas. A primeira, em que as bactérias produtoras de PHB
foram primeiro selecionadas por condições de alimentação
dinâmica aeróbia, com a alimentação simultânea de hidrogénio,
seguida de uma fase de acumulação. Uma segunda estratégia,
onde a alimentação dinâmica aeróbia foi utilizada, seguida de
uma etapa de acumulação. E uma terceira, em que uma cultura
mista foi imediatamente submetida a uma fase de acumulação,
sem seleção prévia. Nas duas primeiras estratégias a
alimentação dinâmica aeróbia consistiu em ciclos de 8 horas (3
ciclos por dia), em que se pretendeu-se que a fase de fartura
durasse 2h30 A fase de fome por seu lado durou 5h30 para um
rácio fome/fartura de 0.45. A fase de acumulação durou 22
horas.

Foram atingidas altas concentrações de biomassa usando
a estratégia 1, num reactor estável, em que foi possível atingir
um conteúdo em PHB de 59 % dos SSV, com um rendimento de
produção de PHB de 0.30 g SLB/g CQO alimentado. A segunda
estratégia resultou num reactor menos estável. Um conteúdo em
PHB de 40 % dos SSV foi obtido, embora o rendimento de
produção de PHB tenho sido só 0.09 g PHB/g CQO. Para além
disso, nem sempre foi possível produzir PHB, visto que a fonte
de carbono parecia ser direcionada para outras vias
metabólicas. Foi atingido um rendimento de produção de PHB
de 0.31  PHB/g CQO na terceira estratégia, no entanto o
conteúdo em PHB foi só 21 % dos SSV.

A produção de PHB foi inicialmente verificada por um
método termogavimétrico desenvolvido na Avecom previamente
a este trabalho. Este método foi posteriormente substituído por
outro que envolve a extração de PHB usando carbonato de
propileno como solvente. O desenvolvimento deste  método é
abordado no presente trabalho.

1 Introduction

One of the major challenges that mankind faces today is to achieve harmony
between the environment and its own survival and continuous well-being [1] . The
current  lifestyle  is  heavily  dependent  on  industry  and  in  the  scientific  and
technological development that supports it [2].

For many years, this development relied on cheap, abundant and easy to use
natural  resources.  In  this  context,  it  was  simpler  and  more  economical  appealing
to use resource and dispose them and the end of their "lifetime", rather than reuse
them.  As  a  result,  a  gap  between  industrial  progress  and  the  development  of
environmental technologies was opened, as the cost associated with
environmental protection seemed considerably higher than its return. Therefore,
resources  were  frequently  used  on  the  basis  of  a  open  cradle-to-grave  cycle,
instead of a cradle-to-cradle one. This is highly unsustainable, as it generates
considerable amounts of waste and leads to the depletion of resources [2].

Nowadays, the paradigm is starting to shift [3]. New sources of raw material
have proven to be expensive and difficult to find [2]. In addition, the cost associated
with the proper waste management and disposal is increasing [2, 3]. These
economical factors are followed up by a significant social and political pressure, as
the  public  grows  unease  towards  its  high  impact  on  the  environment  and
legislation is enforced [3].

New processes and techniques need to be developed and implemented in
order to comply with the social and environmental laws, while providing
economical benefits [2, 3].  This  led  to  the  creation  of  a  new  area  of  industrial
activities and to the offspring of environmental companies [4], where biotechnology
comprises a significant part [3, 4].

1.1 Valorization of waste streams

Waste streams can cause a significant impact on the environment. Currently,
industry is obliged by stiff regulation to properly dispose their waste streams [5].
This can be highly expensive and have a hard impact on the economics of their
activities [2, 5].

Nevertheless, a lot of industries produce waste streams that have actually the
potential to be used in other processes [5].  Waste  gases  rich  in  carbon  dioxide,  an



2

inorganic  carbon  source,  and  waste  waters  usually  rich  in  organic  carbon  can  be
used as substrates in biotechnology processes. At present, these streams are
usually treated in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) [3].  However,  this  is
mostly faced as an economic burden as the treatment plants are usually designed
with the only purpose of treating the stream and not for its valorization [2].

Nowadays, the production of biogas through anaerobic digestion is the most
common process for the valorization of waste water. Biogas is composed by 65%
of methane and so it can be effectively used as an energy source in the production
of green electricity. This "green" electricity is highly funded which allow
companies to reduce the cost of waste treatment or even to profit from it.
However, this technology requires a significant investment to be installed in a
WWTP and funds for the production of electricity from biogas are being cut down.
Furthermore, anaerobic digestion does not efficiently remove nitrogen or
phosphorus compounds from waste waters. This demands extra treatment steps
that  can  be  highly  expensive.   For  these  reasons,  an  alternative  process  for  the
valorizations of waste streams is highly desirable.

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are a group of "bioplastics" that can be
synthesized  by  bacteria,  using  waste  streams  as  feedstock.  They  are  fully
biodegradable and exhibit some similar properties to the petroleum based ones.
Their production at an industrial scale would occur under aerobic conditions,
which allows microorganisms to uptake nitrogen and phosphorus with the carbon
source [6]. That process could be applied in conventional waste water treatment
plants. Thus, the production of these biopolymers would originate added value,
while conveniently treating waste streams [7].

1.2 Aims and scopes

Although promising, the industrial production of PHA is not carried out at
WWTPs nowadays. This technology still requires development while conventional
waste stream treatment technologies are fully developed and successfully applied.
As a result, environmental technology companies have their offer of products and
services focused on this proven technology. Therefore, expertise in the use of
waste  streams  for  the  production  of  PHA  can  be  a  differentiating  factor  for  a
environmental company to withstand among others.

This  work  was  developed  at  Avecom  NV  (Ghent,  Belgium),  a  SME  (small
and  medium  sized  enterprise)  specialized  on  environmental  technology.  Its  core



3

activity is to develop and provide services and efficient products for industry and
other  fields  of  activity.  It  has  expertise  in  the  field  of  aquaria  and  aquaculture,
WWTPs and digesters, and soil remediation, offering services and consultation
such as feasibility studies, sludge analysis, bio-degrading,
nitrification/denitrification and eco-toxicity tests.

The  goal  was  to  gain  in-house  know  how  on  the  production  of  PHA  from
waste streams and to develop products or services that they could joint to the their
current  line  of  offers.  In  this,  the  main  objective  was  to  develop  strategies  for  the
efficient production of PHA by mixed cultures both from gaseous and water waste
streams. The development of this process had to have into account the involved
economics, so it can be presented as a competitive process to anaerobic digestion.

2 Literature review

2.1 Polyhyroxyalkanoates

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are a family of biopolyesters formed by fatty
acids. Unlike polylactic acid (PLA) or poly-butylene succinate (PBS) that require
chemical  polymerization,  PHA  are  the  only  type  of  bioplastics  known  to  be
completely synthesized by microorganisms [6]. Many bacteria are capable of
accumulate these polymers as internal carbon and energy pools. Their synthesis is
triggered  by  growth  limited  conditions,  in  the  presence  of  an  excess  of  carbon
source [8].

PHA can present diverse structures and be classified into short-chain length
(SCL)-PHA, medium-chain-length (MCL)-PHA and long-chain-lenght (LCL)-PHA.
This classification is related to the number of carbon atoms in their building
blocks.  So,  while  SCL-PHA  are  composed  with  monomers  having  3  to  5  carbon
atoms  and  properties  that  are  similar  to  polypropylene,  MCL-PHA  have  6  to  14
carbon atoms in their monomers and have elastic properties similar to rubber and
elastomer [8].  The  LCL-PHA  are  less  studied  and  are  uncommon  to  occur,  being
constituted by monomers with more than 14 carbon atoms [9].

Figure 1 - Common PHA monomers.  Short-chain-length monomers:  3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB),
3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV). Medium-chain-length monomers: 3-hydroxyhexanoate (3HHx),
3-hydroxyoctanoate (3HO), 3-hydroxydecanoate (3HD), 3-hydroxydodecanoate (3HDD) [6].

The  diverse  structural  varieties  of  PHA  results  in  a  wide  range  of  different
characteristics, namely melting temperatures (Tm) between 60 and 177 ºC, glass



5

transition temperatures (Tg) between -50 and 4 ºC and thermodegradation
temperatures (Td(5%)) between 227 and 256 °C [6]. Regarding their mechanical
properties, they can be either brittle or elastic, presenting a very variable Young’s
modulus, an elongation at break ranging from 2 to 1,000% and a tensile strength of
17 to 104 MPa. Their molecular weight can range between 10,000 and 10,000,000 [6].
Thus these polymers can be molecularly designed to exhibit different properties [6,
10].

PLA is brittle, yet its tensile strength is the highest among these bacterial
plastics. Its low glass transition temperature is a handicap for the application of
this  bioplastic,  since  it  changes  shape  at  60ºC.  In  comparison,  a  PHA  with  a
diversified  chain  presents  a  higher  glass  transition  temperature  and  may  more
suitable for practical application. PBS is a flexible material, with considerable
strength for many applications. Its high thermal decomposition temperature (353
ºC) makes it quite thermostable. Polyethylene (PE) based on bioethanol presents
the  same  characteristics  as  the  petroleum-based  PE  and  so  it  can  be  used  for  the
same applications. Poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) and poly(p-phenylene)
(PPP) are two polymers half bio-based, half petroleum-based. While PTT is an
elastic, ductile material, PPP is highly brittle, hard to process polymer that exhibits
electricity-conducting properties [6].

Despite these different properties, all PHA share similar characteristics. They
are biocompatible and biodegradable thermoplastics, formed by chiral monomers
and present functional groups [6].  Furthermore  they  are  gas  impermeable  and
hydrophobic, and present non-linear optical activity and piezoelectrical properties
[6]. All this makes PHA suitable to be used in a wide range of applications, such as
edible  packaging  material,  coating  agents,  flavor  delivery  agents  and  it  can  be
used for making bottles or other containers, cosmetics, films, adhesives, nowoven
fabrics and ion-conduction materials. PHA can also be used for the production of
laminates with other polymers [11].

As mentioned before, an important characteristic of PHA is their
biodegradability. Microorganisms that are able to produce and store
polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are usually also capable of degrading and
metabolize it when the carbon or energy sources are limited. The decomposition of
these polymers into monomers results in (R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid in the case of
poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [12] or  in  a  mixture  of  (R)-3-hydroxybutyric  and  (R)-3-
hydroxyvalerate in the case of the degradation of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-
hydroxyvalerate) [13].  These  monomers  are  water  soluble  and  can  be  easily

metabolized by many bacteria to produce carbon dioxide and water under aerobic
conditions [12, 13].

2.1.1 PHB

Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is the most representative PHA. PHB has a very
low oxygen permeability, water insolubility and optical purity. Its Young’s
modulus and tensile strength are similar to polypropylene, but the elongation at
break is 6% while for polypropylene is 400%. It has a good UV resistance, but poor
resistance  to  acids  and  bases.  It  is  also  toxicologically  safe,  being  suitable  to  be
used in the food and feed industry, pharmaceutical and medical applications and
cosmetics [11].  However,  PHB  may  be  to  brittle  for  many  application  and  in  terms
of  PHA  processing,  the  production  of  copolymers  appears  to  be  of  a  higher
commercial interest [14].

2.2 Industrial Production of Polyhydroxyalkanotes

Through  the  years,  several  companies,  summarized  in  the  Table  2,  have
invested  in   research  and  development  (R&amp;amp;D)  of  PHA  production  process  .  It  is
possible  to  verify  that  a  representative  part  of  these  companies  already  ceased
their PHA related activity. Recent news revealed that ADM and Metabolix, most
likely  the  major  players  in  the  PHA  market,  ended  their  collaboration  for  the
production  of  PHA  due  to  the  lack  of  results  and  huge  losses,  which  may
represent a change of direction for Metabolix [15]. This shows that PHA are more a
“potential” then a reality.

Nowadays PHA are mainly produced as raw and packaging material.
However in this market they compete directly with cheaper synthetic polymers or
with well established bioplastics, like PLA. While synthetic plastics cost around
1.0 €/kg and PLA cost between 2.5 to 5 €/kg, the price of PHA ranges between 6.6
to 10.0 €/kg [16].  This  price  difference  has  been  a  major  barrier  to  the  widely
acceptance of PHA as a viable alternative to the synthetic plastics.

To  achieve  the  economical  success  of  PHA  one  of  two  things  must  be
achieved.  The  first  one  would  be  to  find  a  field  of  application  where  PHA  could
outstand from the competition of synthetic plastics and their cost overlapped by
their benefits. While the other one would be to implement new technologies of
production  and  recover  in  order  to  decrease  the  cost  of  PHA,  as  their  price
depends on the substrate cost, process yield, and downstream process chosen [17].

2.3 Microbial culture

PHA can be produced both by pure cultures as well by open mixed cultures.
Both offer some advantages and some disadvantages regarding each other. In this
section, these two processes are revised using the microorganism Cupriavidus
necator as an model organism for the production of PHA by pure culture.

2.3.1 Mixed Cultures

Mixed cultures are microbial populations that operate in open biological
systems, like those used in biological wastewater treatment processes. The
microbial composition of this type of cultures depends directly of the influent fed
and of the operational conditions imposed on the bioreactor [7].

The capability of mixed cultures to significantly store PHA was observed in
WWTPs were the activated sludge was submitted to periods of excess and lack of
external carbon source. This happens in systems were selectors for bulking control
are used [7],  like  for  example  in  WWTPs   that  are  operated  in  Sequencing  Batch
Reactor (SBR) system [18].

Although  not  all  the  strains  present  in  these  mixed  cultures  are  capable  of
produce  PHA,  it  is  possible  to  enrich  the  cultures  in  PHA-storing  microorganism
by submitting the microbial community to that type of selective pressure [19]. This
is usually carried out by submitting the sludge to dynamic conditions, such as
aerobic  dynamic  feeding  (ADF),  also  known  as  feast  and  famine  regime,  or  to  an
anaerobic/aerobic process [20].

It was already demonstrated that mixed cultures acclimated through aerobic
dynamic conditions could accumulate PHA up to 77% cell dry weight[21]. Under
ADF conditions, the microbial population is submitted to alternating high and
low/none carbon substrate concentrations [19],  hence  being  known  also  by  "feast
and famine" regime. This transient access to an organic carbon substrate generates
a  so-called  unbalanced  growth.  When  there  is  abundance  of  an  organic  carbon
source, the metabolism is directed for the production of PHA. On the other hand,
after the exhaustion of the external substrate, the stored polymer is used as an
energy and carbon source [14]. Usually this process selects for the Thauera, Azoarcus,
or Amaricoccus species, depending of the organic acid used as carbon source. These
identifications were reported for synthetic substrates [20].

The anaerobic/aerobic process is based on the capability of polyphosphate
accumulating organisms (PAOs) and glycogen-accumulating organisms (GAOs) to
accumulate  PHA  under  anaerobic  conditions.  In  the  presence  of  oxygen,  these
microorganisms use the stored PHA for growth, maintenance and to stock
glycogen, a second storage polymer. These glycogen pools are used
simultaneously  with  the  uptake  of  carbon  sources  from  the  medium,  during  the
anaerobic phase. The metabolism of these two groups of microorganism is very
similar, with only some differences. PAOs accumulate polyphosphate under



9

aerobic/anoxic conditions, while the PHA is degraded, in order to store energy
and for growth. This polyphosphate is then degraded and phosphate is released to
the  medium  during  the  anaerobic  phase,  giving  energy  to  the  cell  to  accumulate
PHA.  Meanwhile,  GAOs  only  use  glycogen  as  an  energy  source  during
anaerobiosis, without the accumulation or release of phosphate [20].  The  GAOs
microbial community is mainly composed of Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis,
belonging to the phylum Gammaprotebacteria, Defluviicoccus vanus-related organism
cluster 1, Defluviicoccus vanus-related organism cluster 2 and other bacteria
belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria [20].

However, the amount of PHA accumulated under aerobic/anaerobic process
is generally less than 20%, although higher values (between 30% and 57%) were
already achieved [20]. Due to this, the anaerobic dynamic feeding is a more efficient
strategy for the production of PHA using mixed cultures.

The  production  of  PHA  by  mixed  cultures  offer  some  benefits  over  their
production  by  pure  cultures.  The  main  one  is  that,  since  the  selection  of
microorganism occurs on the basis of their capability to store PHA, there is no
need to work under sterilized conditions [14].  Furthermore,  their  PHB  specific
productivity is 10 times higher than the ones of pure cultures [7].

These types of cultures also allow to use the organic carbon from wastes and
industrial influents [19].  It  was  already  demonstrated  than  mixed  cultures  are
capable of using single VFAs or simple mixtures of them as organic carbon source
[22, 23] , but also of using more complex substrates such as olive oil [24, 25] and palm oil
[26], paper mill effluents [27] sugarcane molasses [28] and other waste effluents such as
food  and  fruit  and  municipal  wastewaters [19]. However, mixed cultures are not
capable of store PHA from sugar-based compounds when submitted to feast and
famine conditions. Thus, these more complex substrates have to be submitted to
previous fermentation process, to transform carbohydrates into volatile fatty acids
(VFAs) and other carboxylic acids, in a process called acidogenesis. These organic
acids can be then used by mixed cultures for the production of PHA [20].  Another
problem is that, so far, it was not possible to achieve high cellular concentrations
associated with high contents in PHA [20].

2.3.2 Pure cultures

Pure  cultures  are  commonly  used  for  the  industrial  production  of  PHA.
Although sterilized conditions are required for pure cultures, they allow the use of



10

metabolic engineered strains in order to improve productivity, as well as the use
of different substrates or to molecularly design the final product [6].

The species Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida [29], Aeromonas
hydrophila [30], Thermus thermophilus [31],  Methylobacterium organophilum [32],
Alcaligenes latus [33], Cupriavidus necator,  as  well  as  several  recombinant  strains  of
Escherichia coli [34], among others, have already been used for the successful
production of PHA.

Cupriavidus necator,  also  known  in  the  past  as Hydrogenomonas eutrophus,
Alcaligenes eutropha, Ralstonia eutrophus and Wautersia eutrophus [35],  is  one
extensively studied and used microorganism, due to its capability of producing
PHA [36]. This Gram-negative bacteria [37] is a strictly aerobe, facultative
chemoautotrophic [36, 38].  It  is  capable  of  using  hydrogen  as  a  metabolic  energy
source [39] and can easily grow and accumulate a large amount of PHA (up to 87 %
as dry cell mass [40]) in a simple defined medium [38].

This microorganism was used for the industrial production of PHB by the
Imperial Chemical Industries (United Kingdom) [38] and  for  the  production  of  a
poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) by Metabolix (USA) using
propionic acid and glucose as substrates.

Cupriavidus necator and  other  pure  cultures,  unlike  mixed  cultures,  are
capable  of  using  complex  substrates  such  as  sugar  molasses  and  other  sources  of
carbohydrates for the production and accumulation of PHA and not only organic
acids. This way, these cultures do not require the acidogenesis step. Nevertheless
it is important to refer that the wild type strain of Cupriavidus necator (H16) is not
capable of metabolizing glucose, since it does not have the enzymes responsible
for glucose transport and its phosphorylation [37]. However, there are natural
occurring mutants capable of metabolize it [41] using the Entner-Doudoroff
pathway [42], and some strains are commercially available [43]. Notwithstanding, the
glucose uptake mechanism by this organism is still not fully understood [35].

Nevertheless, the well known genome and metabolism of Cupriavidus necator
make it an ideal microorganism for the production of specific PHA, both through
natural or recombinant strains [44-46].  The  genes  of Cupriavidus necator are  also
commonly used to recombine in other species. In these are included bacteria such
as Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lacti, yeasts like Saccharomyces cerevisiae, plants like
the Arabidopsis thaliana or tobacco plants, or even in insect cell lines like Spodoptera
frugiperda [47].



11

The  great  advantage  of  using  pure  culture,  towards  mixed  cultures,  is  the
possibility of easily achieve cellular concentrations higher than 80 g/L, with a PHA
content  that  can  be  more  than  80  %  of  the  cell  dry  weight [20].    This  allows  a
simpler and less expensive downstream  process, which may cost of working
under the required sterilized conditions [6].

2.3.3 PHA production metabolism

Storage of PHA occurs when the microbial cells uptake the carbon substrate
at  a  higher  rate  than  the  one  they  can  grow.  This  can  be  due  to  an  external
limitation, such as the lack of nitrogen, phosphorus or oxygen, or by an internal
limitation regarding the levels or activity of anabolic enzymes [7].

There are some known metabolic pathways leading to the synthesis of PHA.
Nevertheless, all of them have in common the production of (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-
CoAs using several metabolites and precursors. PHA is then synthesized using
these produced (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs [37]. The different possible metabolic
pathways that lead to the synthesis of PHA can be observed in  Figure 2.

Most of the PHA-producing bacteria used, like the species Cupriavidus
necator  and Alcaligenes  latus, are capable of using the Entner-Doudoroff pathway,
for the production of acetyl-Coa. This metabolic pathway is responsible for the
catabolic degradation of carbohydrates,  resulting in the formation of pyruvate,
which can be converted into acetyl-CoA. Under conditions favorable to growth,
the  acetyl-CoA   enters  the  tricarboxylic   acid   (TCA)   cycle   where  it  is   oxidized
into   CO2,  in  order  to  generate   anabolic  precursors,  additional  energy,  and
reducing equivalents. These reducing equivalents are consumed during oxidative
phosphorilation, using oxygen as a final electron acceptor, resulting in the
production of ATP. On the other hand, under growth-limiting conditions the
acetyl-CoA is not oxidized to CO2.  The  lack  of  an  external  nitrogen  source,  for
example, will cease the production of proteins, causing the accumulation of
NADH and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) in
the  cell.  This  results  in  the  inhibition  of  the  TCA  cycle  enzymes  and  in  the
conversion of the acetyl-CoA to PHB [7].

Acetyl-CoA  is  converted  to  PHB  in  a  sequence  of  reactions  catalyzed  by
enzymes. First, two units of acetyl-CoA are condensed by the -ketothiolase into
acetoacetyl-CoA, which is then reduced by the acetoacetyl-CoA reductase to (R)-3-



12

hydroxybutyryl-CoA, that is incorporated into the PHB chain  as
3-hydroxybutyrate by PHA synthase [42].  There  are  many  variants  of  PHA
synthases and they are classified depending on the substrate specificities [7]. For
example, Cupriavidus necator wild type possesses a class I PHA synthase that
accepts short chain-hydroxyacyl-CoAs for polymerization [8]. Nevertheless, since
the enzymes involved are stereospecific, all microbially synthesizes hydroxylacyl
monomers are in the (R) configuration [7].

Figure 2 - Methabolic pathways for the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates [20].

Short-chain  organic  acids,  also  known  as  volatile  fatty  acids  (VFAs),  can  be
used  for  the  production  of  PHA  too,  as  they  can  be  activated  to  their
corresponding acyl-CoA molecule. It is assumed that the metabolic pathways
leading  to  the  synthesis  of  PHA  in  mixed  microbial  cultures  must  be  similar  to
those described for pure cultures using the same substrates [48, 49]. For example,
when acetate is used as a carbon source it is converted in to acety-CoA and can be
used both for growth or PHB production as described above. Propionate is
transformed into propionyl-CoA that can be consumed as such to form a
hydroxyacyl unit for the synthesis of PHA or decarboxylated first to acetyl-CoA. A
unit of proionyl-CoAs can be combined with another one to form 3-hydroxy-2-
methylvalerate (3H2MV) or, instead, with one of acetyl-CoA to form either 3-



13

hydroxyvalerate (HV) or 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutyrate (3H2MB).  Butyrate and
valerate  can  be  converted  directly  to  3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA  and  3-
hydroxyvaleryl-CoA, thus they do not require a condensation step like it is the
case of acetate and propionate, as this will form form 3-hydroxybutyrate (HB) and
HV,  respectively.  The  monomers  HB,  HV,  3H2MV  and  3H2MB  are  the  most
frequent PHA monomers synthesized by pure cultures [7].

HB, HV and medium- and long- chain lenght fatty acids can be broken down
to smaller ones by the -oxidation pathway to form PHA monomers. Other
metabolic  pathways,  like  the  novo  fatty  acid  synthesis  also  can  produce
intermediates for PHA production and alkanoates, resulting from the oxidtion of
the corresponding alkanes, can be also converted to their corresponding acyl-CoA
[7].

2.3.3.1 Use of molecular hydrogen in the metabolism

Molecular hydrogen (H2) can be either oxidized or produced biologically, in
a reaction catalyzed by hydrogenases. The most common hydrogenases are the
[NiFe] and the [FeFe] enzymes, which are both capable of catalyze the reversible
oxidation of molecular hydrogen (H2  2H+ + 2e-) [50]. However, while the [NiFe]
hydrogenases are O2-tolerant, the [FeFe] hydrogenases are permanently
inactivated  by  molecular  oxygen,  as  it  reacts  irreversible  with  their  active  site,
destroying it [50].

The [NiFe] hydrogenases are the ones present in Cupriavidus necator [51], due
to  is  strictly  aerobic  nature.  They  present  a  high  affinity  to  H2, thus allowing this
microrganism  oxidize  it  even  when  it  is  present  only  in  trace  amounts [52]. The
strain Cupriavidus necator H16 exhibits a soluble a hydrogen:NAD+ oxido-reductase
[53],  which  can  use  H2 to  regenerate  NAD+ to  NADH,  and  a  membrane-bound
hydrogenase linked to the respiratory chain [53] that  oxides  NADH  back  to  NAD+
[54].  This  reaction  originates  potential  energy  in  the  form  of  a  pH  gradient  and
electrochemical potential across the membrane, which is used by the membrane
enzyme ATP synthase to regenerate ADP to ATP [54].  Thus the oxidation of H2 is
coupled  to  the  reduction  of  O2 [52], by the oxidative phosphorylation pathway [54],
and is used as a metabolic energy source for this bacterium [52]. This allows
Cupriavidus necator to grow autotrophically, on minimal salts medium, using
carbon dioxide as a carbon source [53].



14

The autotrophic production of PHA by Cupriavidus necator has already
been  achieved,  with  a  yield  of  5.6  g  biomass/  mol  H2,  a  maximum  cellular
concentration  of   20  g/L  and  a  PHA  content  of   85  % [55].  However,  no  studies
have been found on the impact of molecular hydrogen on the cellular growth and
PHA production by Cupriavidus necator in heterotrophic conditions. The energy
source  may  enhance  growth  and  PHA  production,  especially  in  low  energy
substrates such as acetate [38]. On the other hand, high intracellular concentrations
of NADH may completely divert the carbon flux from the citric acid cycle to the
PHA  synthesis  pathway.  This  may  happen  since  the  citrate  synthase,  the  first
enzyme from the citric acid cycle, is highly inhibited by NADH, not being capable
of accept acetycl-CoA for the cycle [56].  However,  the  extra  NADH  may  also  be
used in the synthesis of proteins which could promote growth [57]. It is not clear if
Cupriavidus  necator  is  capable  of  use  NADH  to  reduce  NADP+ to  NADPH,  in  a
reaction catalyzed by transhydrogenase enzymes. This molecule has a less
pronounced inhibitory effect on the citrate synthase, while still promotes the
production of PHA [56].

2.4 Industrial waste streams as carbon substrates

The production of PHA usually occurs under aerobic conditions, which
results in high losses of the carbon substrate as CO2 due to cellular respiration. As
a result, less than 50% of the carbon source is directed to biomass growth of PHA
production. This causes the production costs to be highly determined by the cost
of raw materials, which can represent up to 50% of the entire production costs.
The use of purified or synthetic substrates significantly increases the production
price [37]. Then finding suitable low-cost substrates is a priority for the
economically viable production of PHA. The utilization of waste materials for the
production of biopolymers is a cost-efficient strategy that could also help to solve
the disposable problems of several fields of industrial activity [6, 37].

In  Europe,  the  dairy  industry  provides  huge  amounts  of  surplus  whey  that
can be used as a source of lactose for the production of poly(lactic acid), PHA and
bioethanol. Glycerol, a side-product of the biodiesel production, can be used as a
substrate for the production of PHA and lactic acid. Meat and bone meal from the
slaughtering and rendering industries as well as several grass and silage residues



15

showed excellent results for the cultivation of microbes capable of producing PHA
[6].

In other areas of the world, molasses from the sugar industry, starch, waste
lipid and alcohols such as methanol and especially lingo-cellulosic feedstocks may
be available in quantities suitable to be used in industrial processes [6]. For
example, in Malaysia, palm oil is a potential feedstock for PHA production, since
it is produced in very large scales there. The yield from vegetable oils is at least
two times the one from sugars [9].

Although all these prospects regarding cheap inexpensive carbon sources,
their use usually result in lower growth rates due to the inefficient use of certain
nutrients [37].

2.4.1 Volatile Fatty Acids

Volatile  fatty  acids  are  the  only  organic  carbon  source  that  can  be  directly
used both by mixed and pure cultures for the production of PHA. As already seen,
they  are  a  central  part  in  the  PHA  synthesis  pathway  and  by  feeding  of  different
organic acids to these cultures may result in PHA with different properties.

The complex biomass in wastewater can be pre-fermented in order to convert
sugars into volatile fatty acids (VFAs), in an anaerobic process called acidogenesis
[14, 37]. This way is possible to form organic acids such as acetic, propionic, butyric
and valeric acids, with a high yield [14].

It is important to know how to control the final product of this pre-
fermentation, since the VFAs are directly converted by microorganism into their
respective acyl-CoA, which are then used in the synthesis of the PHA chain [19]. So,
the composition of the used organic carbon source fed stream determines the final
PHA structure [14].

However, at high concentrations, these acids can be inhibitory or toxic [37, 58].
This toxicity is attributed to their undissociated lipophilic molecules, which can
easily cross the cell membranes, dissociate and acidify the cytoplasm. As a result,
the gradient of protons across the membrane is disrupted and the energy
production and transport systems associated with this gradient are no longer
maintained [37, 58].  In  response  to  the  accumulation  of  fatty  acids,  free  energy  is
released via ATPase and protons are expelled out of cells in order to maintain the
proton gradient. This means, that lower growth rate, acid utilization rate and yield
of PHA are usually achieved [11, 37, 58].



16

 The  yield  and  rates  are  strongly  influenced  by  the  pH  of  the  mixed  liquor,
since at low pHs the short chain fatty acids are predominantly in the undissociated
form [37].  It  is  the  pKa  value  of  the  organic  acid  and  not  its  size  that  influences  its
inhibitory effect [37, 58]. Since the values for these VFAs are similar (lactic acid pKa =
3.86, acetic acid pKa = 4.76, butyric acid pKa = 4.83 and propionic acid pKa = 4.87),
so is the inhibitory effect of all of them  at a pH value below 5.0 [37].

At  pH  level  close  to  the  optimal  pH  for Cupriavidus necator (pH  7.0)  and  for
mixed cultures, these organic acids are mainly in the dissociated form. Yet they are
not transported so easily across the cell membrane [11, 38],  the  latter  can  cause  an
undesirable increase in osmotic pressure, due to the accumulation of anions [11, 58].
On  the  other  hand,  at  low  initial  VFA  levels,  substrate  limitation  can  occur.  The
concentration of short chain fatty acids and pH has to be thus carefully regulated,
in order for the undissociated fatty acids to enter the cytoplasm, being activated
and metabolized into CO2, cell biomass and/or PHB [37]. For example, it was shown
that propionic acid is used more efficiently by Cupriavidus necator at a pH of 7.5 [59]

and that 5 g.L-1 produce less PHA than 2-3 .L-1 of PHA at pH 7.5 [60].
Lactate  is  the  organic  acid  preferred  acid  by Cupriavidus necator for growth,

followed by acetate, succinate and propionate. Butyrate is only consumed during
the  growth  phase  if  other  organic  acids  are  not  present [37], but it is rapidly
consumed during stationary phase or in the absence of growth by inhibition [37, 61].

Metabolic simulations showed that acetate is an inefficient source for the
production of energy. The ATP required for the uptake of acetate is almost as
much as the one synthesized from its metabolism, being the maintenance ATP low
for growth. Because of this, growth in acetate is slower than with butyrate or
lactate [38]. The utilization of propionate and butyrate are energetically favored, but
additional ATP is needed to transport this acid. Lactate is the preferred, since less
energy is needed to transport it to the central metabolic pathways [37, 38].

Table 2 - Organic carbon flow and metabolic regulation in Cupriavidus necator grown on various
substrates [34]

Acetate Butyrate Lactate
C in CO2/C in substrate 0.38 0.34 0.56
C in biomass/C in substrate 0.15 0.04 0.07
C in PHB/C in substrate 0.47 0.62 0.37
Mol ATP/mol substrate 0.95 5.97 5.75



17

The maximum PHB yields achieved with these simulations were of 0.33, 0.33
and 0.67 mol/mol substrate for acetate, lactate and butyrate, respectively [38].

On  the  other  hand,  the  highest  PHA  production  yields  are  achieved  with
butyric  acid.  Butyrate  is  a  more  energetically  efficient  carbon  source,  for  PHA
production that the other organic acids.

2.5 Reactor Operation

Reactor operation conditions for pure cultures are very different from those
of  mixed  microbial  cultures.  While  pure  controls  require  the  use  of  sterile
conditions, which greatly increases the production cost, the reactor operation is
relatively  simple  and  easier  to  optimize.   On  the  other  hand,   mixed  microbial
cultures do not require sterile conditions, but they require the imposition of
selective pressure in order to select for PHA-producing bacteria. Common reactor
operation  parameters  are  described  below  for  each  case,  with  emphasis  on  the
microbial mixed cultures.

2.5.1 Pure cultures

The  production  of  PHA  by Cupriavidus necator mainly occurs during
stationary phase and so, their production is usually carried out in two steps. First
the  cells  are  fed  with  enough  carbon  and  nitrogen  in  order  to  maximize  growth,
till a high cellular concentration is achieved [35, 37]. After this, a key nutrient, such as
nitrogen, magnesium, molecular oxygen or phosphorus, is limited to trigger PHA
synthesis  and  inhibit  growth.  This  is  usually  carried  out  with  the  suppression  of
nitrogen [57].

The  energy  formation  and  anabolic  reactions  within  the  cell  are  promoted
when  the  Carbon/Nitrogen  (C/N)  ratio  is  less  than  20,  while  a  C/N  ratio  between
20 and 200 inhibits cellular growth, but increases the yield and production rate of
PHB [62]. This was due to the suppression of the -oxidative and
poly(hydroxyalkanoic) pathways, caused by the lack of nitrogen source [62].

It  was  also  verified  that  a  residual  level  of  phosphorus  (0.35  g.L-1) and
magnesium (10 mg.L-1) may enhance PHA production [37]. Since PHB is composed
only  of  carbon,  hydrogen  and  oxygen,  the  feed  of  carbon  source  is  of  primal
significance [38]. The complete exhaustion of phosphorus and magnesium may also



18

have  a  negative  impact  in  the  polymer  molecular  weight  and  increase  the
polydispersity index and should be maintained at residual levels to enhance PHB
production [63].

2.5.2 Mixed Cultures

Studies on production of PHA by mixed microbial cultures are carried out in
two separated reactors. The first one, where the microbial population is selected
and the second, where PHB is accumulated. This is needed, since anaerobic
dynamic feeding conditions are necessary for the selection of PHA-producing
bacteria.  As  a  result,  the  loading  rates  are  limited  and  are  not  high  enough  to
achieve a satisfactory PHB content in the growth reactor [7].

The performance of the PHA accumulation stage is highly influenced by the
effectiveness of these selective pressure conditions and so the optimization of the
selection reactor is of highly importance. Therefore, these conditions must result in
the enrichment of the microbial population in bacteria capable of a high and stable
PHA storage capacity, as microorganism presenting low storage capacities would
have  a   negative  impact  on  the  production  and  downstream  of  PHB.  As  a  result,
this two stages are usually carried in different reactors, so different optimal
conditions can be applied in each one [7].

An  ideal  selection  reactor  would  allow  high  organic  loading  rates  and  short
retention time. Hence, a high growth capacity associated with a high capability to
store PHA is desirable. This would allow the operation of the accumulation
reactor with higher cellular concentration, so higher volumetric production rates
were achievable [7].

The selection reactor is usually operated as a SBR Since they operate per
cycles  comprising  distinct  periods.  Usually,  the  cycle  starts  with  the  feed  of  the
reactor, followed by the reaction phase that includes both feast and famine,
settling  phase  and  discharge  of  the  supernatant.  This  allows  the  imposition  of  a
wide range of parameters [64]. Several factor that regulate the use of the carbon
source  during  feast  phase  either  for  growth  or  for  the  storage  of  PHA  have  been
studied under different conditions, namely solids retention time (SRT), hydraulic
retention time (HRT), pH, temperature, cycle length, feast to famine length ratio
(F/F ratio), volumetric loading rate (VLR), influent carbon source and nutrients
concentration and the associated limitation/inhibition kinetics [7].



19

It  was  demonstrated  that  for  SRTs  higher  than  2  days,  the  yield  of  PHB
production under excess nutrients was constant and independent form the specific
growth  rate.  However,  at  a  SRT   lower  than  2  days,  this  yield  significantly
decreases with a decreasing SRT [48].

Table 3 - Usual operational parameters applied on the growh reactor [14]

The F/F ratio is one of the main parameters regulating if the carbon source is
used for growth or for PHA storage. At high PHA storage capacity was observed
for low F/F ratios (up to 0.26), while  high F/F ratios (higher than 0.90) promoted a
growth response in a culture fed with synthetic organic acids and a SRT of 1 day.
A  similar  observation  was  made  in  a  culture  using  fermented  molasses  as
feedstock and a SRT of 10 days [7]. This is possible to verify in Figure 3.

Figure 3 - PHA and active biomass yields on substrate, regarding the feast/famine ratio. SBR operated
at a SRT of 1 day (a); and at a SRT of 10 days (b) [7].

The reason behind this growth/PHA storage regulation is related with the
decrease of the amount of intracellular components required for cell growth, such
as RNA and enzymes, during famine phase. Therefore, when the carbon source is



20

available again cellular growth is internally limited, while the accumulation of
PHA  is  energetically  less  demanding.  This  way,  the  cell  can  rapidly  consume  the
external carbon source and store it, while the growth metabolism is not reactivated
[7].  As  a  result,  after  long  periods  of  starvation  around  70%  (Cmol/Cmol)  of  the
carbon source can be used towards storage, rather than growth and maintenance
[48, 49].

The manipulation of the influent substrate concentration and/or the loading
rates can be used not only to regulate the F/F ratio, but also to control the substrate
uptake  rate.  This  should  increase  with  increasing  loading  rates,  till  a  maximum
value, after which substrate inhibition is verified. Since PHA-producing
microorganism use the substrate uptake rate as a competitive advantage towards
others, so it does not limit the uptake rate. As a result, if the substrate
concentration is kept above a kinetically limiting value and below the substrate
inhibition point, this may result in an increased selection efficiency [7].

The  selection  of  cultures  with  a  high  capacity  to  store  PHA  was  already
achieved both under nutrient excess and nutrient limiting conditions, as PHA
storage occurs due to an internal limitation rather than to an nutrient limitation.
Nevertheless, the amount of nutrients available can be used to control the amount
of  carbon  source  used  for  growth,  not  only  during  feast,  but  also  during  famine.
Under excess of nutrients, microorganisms can use the polymer stored during
feast in order to grow during famine, giving them an extra competitive advantage
as  a  stable  growth  rate  is  possible  to  maintain.  Furthermore,  cultures  adapted  in
the  presence  of  nutrients  excess  are  more  insensible  to  them  in  the  accumulation
reactor, which may be fundamental if complex feedstocks are used [26].

2.5.2.1 Oxygen

A determinant factor in the achievement of high cell densities and growth
rates are  the aeration rate and gas stream composition [65]. It seems to be important
to  maintain  oxygen  saturation  in  the  mixed  liquor  of  at  least  2.0  mg/L.  However,
during the exponential Phase, the oxygen requirements can be higher than this
and  the  use  pure  oxygen  could  be  required.  This  is  an  expensive  process  at  large
scale, that should be compensated with a high volumetric productivity [65].

The  dissolved  oxygen  (DO)  is  a  good  way  to  easily  identify  the
beginning/end of the feast and famine phases. The beginning of the feast phase is
associated with a decrease in the dissolved oxygen concentration. This happens



21

right after the substrate addition, being and indicator that the microbial
population is metabolizing the substrate. The concentration of dissolved oxygen
remains more or less the same during the feast period, increasing again in the end
of it/beginning of famine [14].

2.6 Harvesting and PHA purification

PHA  are  accumulated  in  the  bacterial  cell  cytoplasm  in  the  form  of
granules.  This  granules  have  an  average  size  of  0.2  –  0.5  µm.  This  makes  the
recovery  of  PHA  a  challenging  process,  with  the  harvesting  of  cells  and  PHB
extraction significantly affect the price of the final product [9], which can represent
more than 26% [58].

A  diagram  of  the  whole  PHA  production  process  is  possible  to  observe  in
Figure 4. First, the cells should be harvested. Usually this is carried out by biomass
precipitation, that can promoted by the of 1% Na2HPO4, 1% CaCl, and 100 ppm of
polyacrylamide to the medium [9].  After  that  biomass  is  pressed  filter  in  order  to
remove water and the cakes are then freeze-dried and ground into powder [6, 9].

Figure 4 - General PHA production and extraction process [6]

To  extract  PHA  is  then  necessary  to  rupture  the  bacterial  cell  in  order  to
release  the  granules.  There  are  several  ways  to  rupture  the  cells  and  afterwards



22

recover  the  PHA.  To  disrupt  cells,  several  digestion  methods  can  be  applied,  as
well as mechanical disruption. The recovery of PHA can also be carried out using
solvent extraction or two-phase systems [9].

The required PHA purity is determined by the final application it is intended
to  be  used.  For  example  for  mulching  film  or  garbage  bags,  a  lower  degree  of
purity  may  be  used.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  PHA  is  produced  to  be  used  in
medical applications, that the final product has to be free of any contaminating
chemicals, solvents or endotoxins [9].

Regardless the final application of PHA, it must be assured that a sufficiently
high  molecular  weight,  so  it  can  be  further  processed.  This  may  be  problematic
since,  to  achieve  high  purities  of  the  polymer,  aggressive  extraction  methods  are
usually required, which cause polymer degradation. Thus a compromise between
purity,  efficiency  of  recover  and  the  molecular  weight  of  the  polymer  must  be
achieved. Furthermore this has to be done in a environmental friendly way, with
an associated economical feasibility [9]. Some proposed methods are reviewed in
here.

2.6.1 Digestion methods

 Digestion methods involve the solubilization of the non-PHA cellular mass.
This digestion can be classified into either enzymatic or chemical [6].

Various  types  of  enzymes  can  be  used  for  the  enzymatic  digestion  of  the
PHA-producing biomass. The enzymes used can be proteases such as trypsin,
chymotrypsin, papain and bromelain, but also -glycosidases like cellulase and
lysozyme [66]. These enzymes are capable of cleaving linkages in the bacteria cell
wall [67],  which  results  in  the  lyses  of  the  cell [68]. Since enzymes are very specific
with  respect  to  the  reactions  that  catalyze  and  since  they  can  operate  in  mild
conditions, it is possible to recover PHA with good quality and without molecular
weight degradation.

Chemical digestion is usually carried out using sodium hypochlorite or
surfactants. Sodium hypochlorite is a strong, non-selective oxidizer that can be
used to disrupt the cells [69]. Among the surfactants, SDS presents a good
performance  in  destabilizing  the  cell  wall  and  membranes,  but  other  can  be  used
[9]. The problem with this method is while the digestion by hypochlorite can cause
severe degradation of the molecular weight of the PHA chains (up to 50%), the



23

surfactants alone have lower recovery efficiencies [70] and  lower  degrees  of  purity
are achieved [71].

 Nevertheless most of the studies have been directed to the use of chemicals.
This happens because of the easy access to various suitable chemicals and to the
high cost of enzymes and to the complexity of their recovery from the medium [9].

2.6.2 Mechanical disruption

The mechanical disruption of cell does not involve the use of chemicals, so it
minimizes the contamination to the product as well as the environmental
pollution. The two main methods used, for large scale cellular disruption in
pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are the bead-milling and the high
pressure homogenization [72].

Bead  mills  cause  cellular  disruption  due  to  the  shearing  action  and  energy
transfer from beads to cells in the contact zones. This method is ideal for the
extraction of PHA, since it does not require much power supply, is not susceptible
to blockages and does not degrade the PHA granules [72]. However, it requires an
extensive optimization in order to establish an efficient disruption system [9].

In the high pressures homogenization, cells are obliged to pass through a
restricted orifice discharged valve under high pressure. Some possible
drawbacks of these method are the possible micronization of PHA, a process that
reduces the PHA particles to a micrometric or nanometric scale, and the formation
of fine cellular debris that can interfere with the further downstream process [73].

Nevertheless, both technologies have already been successfully tested for the
recovery of PHA from biomass [72]. Generally the drawbacks of these methods are
the high capital investment required, the long processing time and the difficulty to
scale them up [9].

2.6.3 Solvent extraction

Solvent extraction is the most extensively adopted method to recover PHA,
especially at laboratory scale, due to its simplicity and rapidness. The solvents
used are commonly chlorinated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, 1,2-
dichloroethane [74]



24

 First  the  cell  membrane  permeability  has  to  be  modified  in  order  for  the
solvent to access the intracellular PHA [75]. After being dissolved by the solvent,
PHA are separated from the remaining biomass by filtration or centrifugation.
They are then precipitated, usually by addition of a non-solvent such as methanol
or ethanol to the solution [74]. This method of extraction is highly efficient, causes
negligible polymer degradation and allows for the removal of bacterial
endotoxins.

 However, chlorinated hydrocarbons are highly pollutant and expensive to
be used on high scale. The use of some cyclic carbonates like ethylene carbonate [9]

and 1,2-propylene carbonate [76, 77] may overcome this problem.
A problem inherent to all solvent extraction is that they disrupt the

amorphous nascent state of the PHA granules [9, 69, 78],  which  may  be  useful  for
some applications. The solubilization of the granules and further precipitation
makes PHA to re-crystallize in a more crystalline state [46, 69], becoming more brittle
and harder to process [79].

3 Materials and Methods

3.1 Microorganisms

Activated sludge from two different wastewater treatment plants were used
as inocula for the bioreactors. The wastewater treatment plants were both from
food/feed processing companies and were operated as SBRs.

The  activated  sludge  used  in  Hydrocell  (Chapter  4)  came  from  Solae,  a
protein processing factory in Ieper, Belgium. On the other hand, the activated
sludge  for  the  Production  of  PHB  by  ADF  (Chapter  5)  and  for  the  Production  of
Fish Feed (Chapter 6) came from Van Steenberge, a brewery in Ertvelde, Belgium.

3.2 Reactor operation

Three different process for the production of PHB were tested: Hydrocell
(Chapter 4); Production of PHB by ADF (Chapter 5); and Production of Fish Feed
(Chapter 6).

The processes described in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 share some
characteristics and basically comprise two main steps. The first one, the growth
reactor, is used for the selection and growth of PHB producing bacteria. While on
the second one, the accumulation reactor, the biomass selected in the growth
reactor  is  fed  with  enough  carbon  source  in  order  to  accumulate  a  significant
amount  of  PHB.  In  the  process  described  in  Chapter  6,  the  biomass  was  not
previously  acclimated  in  a  growth  reactor,  but  was  instead  used  directly  in  an
accumulation reactor.

The procedures are explained in further detail in each one of their
corresponding chapters. Nevertheless, some general methodologies  are explained
below.

3.2.1 Hydrocell (Chapter 4)

A 3 reactors system was assembled for the Hydrocell process, consisting of a
electrolysis, a growth and an accumulation reactor. The electrolysis reactor, as the
name  implies,  was  used  for  the  electrolysis  of  water  and  the  consequent



26

production of H2 and O2. The selection and growth of the PHB producing bacteria
from activated sludge was carried out on the growth reactor. The headspace of the
electrolysis reactor was connected to this reactor thus allowing the continuous
supply of H2 and O2 to the growth medium via fine bubbling.  Putting things into
perspective, these two reactor worked together for the selection of PHB producing
bacteria, the first step of a two steps process, as described in Chapter 3.2.

The accumulation reactor comprises the second of those steps. In this step,
part of the biomass from the grow reactor is transferred to another reactor where
conditions that promote the production of PHB are applied. However, due to the
lack  of  means,  this  was  not  done  in  a  regular  defined  basis.  In  the  cases  an
accumulation stage was not carried out, the excess sludge was discarded.

The  diagram  of  the  process  is  described  in  Figure  5.  The  methods  for  each
reactor  are  described  further  below.  Analyses  were  made  as  described  in  chapter
3.3 and the formulas used are described in Appendix B.

3.2.1.1 Electrolysis reactor

 An electrolysis system was assembled in a closed reactor for the production
of hydrogen (and oxygen) gas. This consisted of two electrodes: one in titanium
and the other one in titanium, coated with Iridium oxide. In order to avoid contact

between  the  electrodes,  they  were  fixed  to  plastic  carriers,  at  a  distance  of  15  cm.
The area of the electrodes was of 79 cm2.

The electrodes were connected to an alternating current - direct current (AC-
DC) power supply. The positive pole of the power supply was connected to the
iridium oxide coated titanium electrode (the electrolysis' anode) and the negative
pole was connected to the other titanium electrode (the electrolysis' cathode).

The electrodes were then covered, by adding 4.0 L of tap water containing 1
g/L Na2SO4.  The  salt  was  added  in  order  to  improve  the  conductivity  of  the
system. This medium was kept under constant stirring. A electric current of 20.2 V
(±  0.2)  with  a  intensity  of   0.6  A  was  applied  so   the  electrolysis  of  water  was
achieved.

The headspace of this reactor was coupled to the growth reactor in order to
provide H2 and O2 to the growth medium, via fine bubbling.

3.2.1.2 Growth reactor

The reactor was incubated with 4 L of activated sludge from a protein factory
waste water treatment plant, as described in Chapter 3.1.

The reactor was operated in the 3 cycles of 8 hours per day. At the beginning
of  each  cycle,  150  mL  of  fresh  influent  were  added  during  the  1st  minute.  The
duration of the feast phase was controlled at 2.5 h, while the famine phase lasted
for  5.5  h.  The  compositions  of  the  influents  used  are  described  on  Appendix  A
Hydrogen  and  oxygen  gases  form  the  electrolysis  were  fed  continuously  during
both phases. Aeration was also applied continuously by means of a aeration stone
and  stirring  was  kept  at  300  rpm.  pH  in  the  reactor  was  kept  below  7.8  (±  2%),
with diluted sulfuric acid 1 M.

Hydraulic retention time (Equation 10, Appendix B)  was not maintained
constant over the experiment. It started at 18.1 days, but it was gradually reduced
till 8.1 days on on day 5.  On day 10 it was verified that the pump responsible for
feeding the reactor with fresh influent was not capable of maintaining the
calibrated flowrate. As a result, the HRT on this day was of 28 days. After this, the
HRT was adjusted to a average value of 14.4 days (±3.4) from day 11 till day 21.
For the last ten days, from day 22 till day 32, the HRT was adjusted to an average
of 11.2 days (± 0.8). All this gave a global a average retention time of 12.9 (± 3.1)
days.



28

Solid  retention  time  (Equation  11,  Appendix  B)  was  the  same  as  HRT  as
volume was removed from the reactor as mixed liquor. The relatively high
retention times were chosen in order to allow the growth of autotrophic bacteria,
since this is slower than the heterotrophic one in C. necator [80]. This is also evident,
in activated sludge where the nitrifying bacteria, that are autotrophic, have slower
growth rates than the heterotrophic bacteria [64].

On day 3, 4, 7 and 10 approximately 1/3 of the total volume of mixed liquor
was transferred to the accumulation reactor in order to test the sludge for its
capability to accumulate PHB, by supplying sufficient carbon source. The volume
of the growth reactor was setback to 4 L by adding fresh activated sludge.

On days 14, 17, 21, 24, 28 and 31 the volume in excess in the growth reactor
was  purged,  so  the  volume  was  set  back  to  4L.  No  fresh  activated  sludge  was
added by this times.

3.2.1.3 Accumulation tests

 The capability of the biomass selected in the growth reactor to produce and
store PHB was tested under both heterotrophic and autotrophic conditions. In
order to the this, the mixed liquor withdrawn from the growth reactor on days 3, 4
and 10 was re-inoculated in accumulation reactors.

The accumulation tests in heterotrophic conditions were carried out on days
4  and  10  using  acetic  acid  as  carbon  and  energy  source.  The  accumulation  test  in
autotrophic  conditions  were  carried  out  on  days  3  and  10  and  H2  was  used  as
energy source in order to allow the use of inorganic carbon sources. The detailed
operation of the two reactors is explained below.

The PHB content and its production was evaluated by means of SLB.

3.2.1.3.1 Accumulation test with acetic acid

 1  L  of  sludge  from  the  growth  reactor  was  incubated  on  a  2  L  vessel.  The
reactor was fed by the means of pH-stat, in order to dose a influent stream reach in
acetic acid. The setpoint was defined to be at pH 7.2 (±3%) and was controlled by
PC-Panel  µDCU  software  and  a  pH  meter  Easyferm  plus  K8  425,  Hamilton



29

Bonaduz  AG,  connected  to  a  Biostat®  A  plus  main  system,  by  Sartorius  BBI
Systems.

The influent solution was prepared by diluting a solution of acetic acid 80 %
(w/w) with water, to a final concentration of 40 g COD/L. No other nutrient
sources were added and no pH corrections were done to the influent stream.

The  reactor  medium  was  kept  under  constant  stirring  by  means  of  an
electrical pump, while air was provided through fine bubbling.

3.2.1.3.2 Accumulation test with in autotrophic conditions

 1 L of sludge from the growth reactor was incubated on a 2 liter vessel. The
reactor  was  aerated  with  a  hydrogen  flow  of  50  mL  H2/min via fine bubbling. It
was considered that the bicarbonate resultant form the biomass degradation
processes in the growth reactor was a sufficient source of inorganic carbon for
accumulation. Therefore, no other carbon source was added to the medium, with
exception to the normal carbon dioxide content in the air stream.

3.2.2 Production of PHB by ADF (Chapter 5)

Production of PHB by ADF was carried out in a two steps system consisting
of a growth reactor and an accumulation reactor. The growth reactor was used for
the selection and growth of PHB-producing bacteria, by submitting activated
sludge  to  aerobic  dynamic  feeding  conditions.  The  volume  in  excess  on  this
growth reactor was then transferred to an accumulation reactor, where the carbon
source (acetic acid) was supplied in excess to the selected microbial community, so
PHB could be produced and stored by the PHB-producing bacteria. A diagram of
the process is presents in Figure 6.

To  achieve  this,  activated  sludge  was  collected  from  a  brewery  wastewater
treatment plant, which was operated in a SBR system (described in Chapter 3.1).
The  collected  sludge  was  left  to  settle  in  a  cold  room  overnight,  after  which  the
supernatant was discarded ( 50% of the total volume) prior to be incubated in the
growth reactor.

This  system  was  tested  for  a  total  of  64  days  and  several  operation
parameters were tested over time, for both the growth reactor and the



30

accumulation reactor. However, due to the instability of the reactor it was
necessary to restart the growth reactor with fresh sludge on 2 instances, for a total
of  3  runs.  This  implied  that  the  microbial  community  in  the  growth  reactor  was
not  kept  after  each  restart.  In  regard  to  the  results,  these  3  runs  will  be  referred
henceforward as "PHB production A", "PHB production B" and "PHB production
C".  Each  one  of  these  systems  will  be  addressed  in  a  different  subchapter
comprising the growth reactor and the accumulation reactors.

The operation parameters of the reactors were different from reactor to
reactor  and  varied  over  time  according  to  the  results,  the  observations  made  and
the  knowledge  gathered  with  the  previous  trials.  These  are  explained  in  further
detail below.

The methods of analysis used are the ones explained in Chapter 3. PHB was
quantified by extraction with 1,2-propylene carbonate.

3.2.2.1 PHB prodution A

3.2.2.1.1 Growth reactor - A

A  5  L  reactor  was  incubated  with  2  L  of  the  decanted  activated  sludge.  The
system was operated in an aerobic dynamic feeding regime (feast &amp;amp; famine), with
3  cycles  of  8  hours  per  day.  It  was  intended  that  the  feast  phase  occurred  during
the first 2 h 30 of each cycle, for a maximum feast/famine ratio of 0.45. For that, 200
ML  of  fresh  influent  were  added  to  the  medium  per  cycle.  The  extension  of  the
feast phase was controlled by regulating the COD concentration of the influent,
having  in  consideration  the  values  of  the  analysis  done  to  the  reactor's  medium
during the cycle. The influent composition can be verified in Appendix A.

600  mL  of  volume  were  withdrawn  from  the  reactor  each  day,  in  order  to
maintain  the  HRT  at  4.33  days.  However,  this  was  not  possible  on  days  4  and  5,
and  11  and  12.  As  a  result,  on  days  6  and  13  the  HRT  was  off  6.33.  This  gives  an
average  HRT  of  5.13  days.  Since  there  was  no  settling  phase  and  the  volume  of
sludge in excess was withdrawn as mixed liquor, the SRT was equal to the HRT.

The  medium  was  continuously  supplied  with  oxygen,  via  aeration  through
aeration stone, and stirred at  300 rpm. pH was controlled, fist using HCl 1 M and
with H2SO4 1 M after day 10,  in order to keep the culture medium at pH  8.5.

3.2.2.1.2 Accumulation reactors - A

No accumulation tests were carried out during this period.

3.2.2.2 PHB Production B

3.2.2.2.1 Growth reactor - B

A  5  L  reactor  was  then  incubated  with  the  2  L  of  activated  sludge.  The
medium  of  growth  reactor  A  was  neutralized  with  sodium  hydroxide  and  the
biomass  was  recovered  by  centrifugation  at  3,000  rpm  for  10  minutes,  while  the



32

supernatant was discarded. The recovered biomass was in the activated sludge
inoculated.

The  system  was  operated  in  an  aerobic  dynamic  feeding  regime  (feast  &amp;amp;
famine),  with  3  cycles  of  8  hours  per  day.  It  was  intended  that  the  feast  phase
occurred  during  the  first  2  h  30  of  each  cycle.  For  that,  200  ML  of  fresh  influent
were added to the medium per cycle, using a peristaltic pump with a flow rate of
6.66  mL/min.  Initially,  this  volume  was  completely  fed  in  single  feed  pulse  of  30
minuts, at the start of each feast phase. On day 11, the feed volume was split into
two equal feed pulses of 15 minutes each, at 0.00 h and 1.00 h. This was changed
again  on  day  16,  to  3  equal  feed  pulses  of  10  minutes  each,  at  0.00  h,  0.75  h  and
1.50 h of feast.

The  extension  of  the  feast  phase  was  controlled  by  regulating  the  COD
concentration of the influent, having in consideration the values of the analysis
done to the reactor's medium during the cycle.  The composition o of the influents
used can be observed on Appendix A.

600  mL  of  volume  were  withdrawn  from  the  reactor  each  day,  in  order  to
maintain the HRT at 4.33 days. However, this was not possible on days 5 - 6, 12 -
 13, 19 - 20 and 26 - 27. As a result, on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 the HRT corresponded
to  6.33  days.  This  gave  an  average  HRT  of  5.08  days.  Since  there  was  no  settling
phase and the volume of sludge in excess was withdrawn as mixed liquor, the SRT
was  design  to  be  equal  to  the  HRT.  Nevertheless,  this  was  not  verified  on  days  7
and  14,  as  the  biomass  was  recovered  from  the  withdrawn  mixed  liquor,  by
centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes, and re-inoculated back again in the
growth reactor.

On  day  28,  2  L  of  mixed  liquor  were  replaced  by  2  L  of  fresh  activated
sludge. The biomass from this mixed liquor was also recovered by centrifugation
and re-inoculated in the growth reactor.

The  medium  was  continuously  supplied  with  oxygen,  via  aeration  through
aeration stone, and stirred at  300 rpm. pH was controlled, first using HCl 1 M
and with H2SO4 1 M after day 10,  in order to keep the culture medium at pH  8.5.

3.2.2.2.2 Accumulation reactors - B

Accumulation tests were performed on the activated sludge from growth
reactor  B  on  days  2,  7,  10,  15  and  21  of  this  reactor.  In  order  to  carry  this  out,   a



33

2000  mL  reactor  was  incubated  with  400  mL  of  mixed  liquor  from  the  growth
reactor,  except  on  day  7  where  the  accumulation  reactor  was  incubated  with  500
mL.  The  mixed  liquor  was  always  taken  from  the  growth  reactor  at  the  end  of
feast phase.

The accumulation reactors were operated in a feed pulse strategy, with the
medium being fed every 3 hours with 13.3 mL of synthetic influent, for a total of 8
feed  pulses  per  day.  On  the  accumulation  test  of  day  21  this  was  changed  to  20
feed  pulses  per  day,  where  6.7  mL  of  synthetic  influent  were  added  every  72
minutes.  The  influent  solution  was  composed  only  by  acetic  acid/acetate  and
ammonium chloride, with a COD/N ratio of 100/1 on days 2, 7 and 10 and with a
COD/N  ratio  of  100/2  on  days  15  and  21.  This  solution  was  prepared  so  the
volumetric loading rate in the fill up reactor would be eight thirds (8/3) of the
volumetric loading rate applied on the growth reactor on that day.

The  HRT  and  SRT  of  the  accumulation  reactors  was  kept  at  1  day.  The
medium  was  continuously  supplied  with  oxygen,  via  aeration  through  aeration
stone, and constantly stirred.

3.2.2.3 PHB Production C

3.2.2.3.1 Growth reactor - C

A  6  L  reactor  was  incubated  with  3  L  of  the  decanted  activated  sludge.  The
system was operated in an aerobic dynamic feeding regime (feast &amp;amp; famine), with
3  cycles  of  8  hours  per  day.  It  was  intended  that  the  feast  phase  occurred  during
the first 2 h 30 of each cycle, for a maximum feast/famine ratio of 0.45. For that, 400
mL  of  fresh  influent  were  added  to  the  medium  per  cycle.  This  volume  was
increased to 500 mL on day 14 and forward. These volumes were fed over 6 feed
pulses, 1 each 25 minutes, for 10 and 12 minutes respectively.  The extension of the
feast  phase  was  controlled  by  the  DO  values  and  confirmed  by  GC  analysis.  The
composition of the influents used can be observed on Appendix A.

The  reactor  conditions  were  designed  for  an  active  volume  of  4.2  L  and  a
HRT  of  3.5  days.  With  the  increase  of  the  volume  fed  per  cycle  on  day  14,  these
parameters  were  changed  to  an  active  volume  of  4.5  L  and  a  HRT  of  3.5  days.  In
order to do so, 1200 mL of mixed liquor were withdrawn from the growth reactor



34

each  day,  from  day  1  to  day  14,  being  this  volume  increased  to  1.5  L  afterwards.
Since  there  was  no  settling  phase  and  the  volume  of  sludge  in  excess  was
withdrawn as mixed liquor, the SRT was equal to the HRT.

The  medium  was  continuously  supplied  with  oxygen,  via  aeration  through

aeration  stone,  and  stirred  at   300  rpm.  pH  was  controlled  using   H2SO4 1  M  at

pH  8.5, in order to prevent the conversion of ammonium to ammonia.

3.2.2.3.2  Accumulation reactors - C

Accumulation  tests  were  performed  in  a  2  L  reactor.  For  this,  1200  mL  of
mixed  liquor  were  withdrawn  from  growth  reactor  C   at  the  end  of  feast  phase.
The mixed liquor was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3,000 rpm in order to remove
the supernatant, so the nutrients of the growth reactor medium wouldn't interfere
with accumulation test. The pellet was used to incubate the accumulation reactor.
On days 7, 8 and 9 the pellet was resupended on 1000 mL of tap water, while on
days 13 and 14 the volume of water was increased to 1200 mL.

  The  accumulation  reactor  was  fed  every  72  minutes  with  a  4  minutes  feed
pulse  having  a  flowrate  of  6.66  mL/min.  As  a  result,  0.5  L  were  fed  over  the  22
hours of the fed batch. On days 7, 8 and 9 the influent solution was composed by
acetic acid/acetate and ammonium chloride in a COD/N ratio of 100/1, while on
days 13 and 14 it was composed only of acetic acid/sodium acetate. This solution
was prepared so the volumetric loading rate in the fill up reactor would be 3 time
higher than the volumetric loading rate of the growth reactor.

The medium was continuously supplied with oxygen, through fine bubbling
and constantly stirred.

3.2.3 Production of PHB enriched SCP (Chapter 6)

Activated  sludge  was  collected  from  the  brewery's  WWTP  operated  in  SBR
described  in  Chapter  3.1.  The  sludge  was  left  to  settle  for  an  hour,  after  which  it
was decanted to 50 % of its initial volume and stored at 4 °C till being used.

The  reactor  was  operated  in  fed-batch  mode.  The  feed  of  the  reactor  was
controlled  by  pH-stat,  with  a  setpoint  of  8,2.  The  influent  used  had  a  COD



35

concentration  of  60  g/L,  being  50  %  of  it  acetic  acid  and  the  other  50  %  sodium
acetate. The pH of the influent was corrected to 4.75 using sodium hydroxide and
no further nutrients were used.

For the test batch,  3 L of decanted sludge were diluted in 3 L of fresh water
and inoculated in a 10 L reactor. In the third batch, the reactor was inoculated with
6 L of decanted activated sludge, diluted in 6 L of fresh water.

Every  batch  was  operated  overnight  and  stopped  in  the  next  morning.  The
final  volume  of  the  reactor  and  the  volume  of  influent  fed  were  evaluated.  The
sludge was left to settle and the water in excess (around 45% of the total volume)
was decanted. The sludge was poured into trays and dried overnight, at 60 °C, in
order to form flocks.

TSS,  VSS  and  VFA  were  analyzed  at  the  beginning  and  end  of  the  batch  as
described  previously.  The  PHB  content  was  evaluated  gravimetrically,  after
cellular lysis with a hypochlorite solution and recovery using propylene
carbonate, as described in more detail in Chapter 7.

3.2.4 Development of a new method for PHB quantification
(Chapter 7)

The method develop for the quantification of PHB was based on the
gravimetric analysis of PHB. This consists of 3 main steps, namely (1) the lysis of
the PHB containing cells; (2) the dissolution on PHB and separation from the
cellular debris; (3) and the recovery of the PHB polymer.

3.2.4.1 Cellular lysis

In order to allow a better recovery of the polymer, the cell must be lysed so
the  solvent  can  easily  access  the  intracellular   PHB.  Two  methods  were  used  to
cause  cellular  disruption.  One  based  on  the  mechanical  disruption  of  cells  due  to
the  increased  volume  of  water  when  frozen,  and  other  based  on  the  chemical
digestion of cells by hypochlorite.



36

3.2.4.1.1 Freeze and thaw cycles

Samples  of  20  mL  of  sludge  were  collected  into  falcon  tubes.  They  samples
were centrifuged at 10.000 rpm for 10 minutes, after which the supernatant was
discarded and the pellet resuspended in demineralised water. Then, the samples
were immediately placed in a freezer in order to froze. After being completely
frozen, the sample was place in a warm bath till it was completely defrosted again.
During  thaw  the  sample  was  shaken  several  times.  The  freeze  and  thaw  was
repeated more two times before other analysis were carried.

This  step  was  used  for  PHB  quantification  throughout  Chapter  5  and
Chapter 6.

3.2.4.1.2 Hypochlorite digestion

Samples of 20 mL of sludge were collected into falcon tubes and centrifuge it
for 10 minutes at 10,000 rpm. The supernatants were then discarded and the pellet
was resuspended in 20 mL of a hypochlorite solution 20° (6% of active chlorine).

After  5  minutes,  1  mL  of  H2SO4 1M  was  added  to  each  sample  in  order  to
neutralize  the  pH  of  the  solution.  This  would  protect  the  PHB  from  being
hydrolyzed. The addition of acid may originate chlorine gas, so it was done inside
a fume hood. The samples were then immediately centrifuged at 10,000. The
supernatant was discarded and the pellet rinsed with dematerialized water. The
samples  were  centrifuge  once  again  for  10  minutes  at  10,000  rpm  and  the
supernatants were discarded.

3.2.4.2 Extraction with chloroform

The sludge in the falcon tubes was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 minutes
after  which  the  supernatant  was  discarded  and  the  pellet  rinsed  with
demineralized water. The solution was submitted to another centrifugation, in the
same condition, and the supernatant was discarded again.

The  pellet  was  then  washed  from  the  falcon  tube  to  a  schott  bottle  with  30
mL of choroform and then incubated at 37 ºC overnight, under constant stirring.
In  the  next  day,  the  chloroform  solutions  were  vacuum  filtered  using  fiber  glass
filters  (0.45  µm  of  pore  size,  binding  agents  free)  in  order  to  withdraw  the  non



37

dissolved biomass, washing the schott bottles and filters with additional 5 mL of
chloroform. The chloroform solution containing the dissolved PHA was then
poured into pre-weighted crucibles and the filtration flask was rinsed with
methanol.

 The  chloroform  and  methanol  in  the  crucibles  were  let  to  dry  overnight  at
room temperature in order to evaporate both the chloroform and methanol and
further  dried  at  105  ºC  to  remove  water.  After  cooling  down  the  crucibles  were
reweighted.

3.2.4.3 Extraction with 1,2-propylene carbonate

 The sludge in the falcon tubes was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 minutes
after  which  the  supernatant  was  discarded  and  the  pellet  rinsed  with
demineralized water. The solution was submitted to another centrifugation, in the
same condition, and the supernatant was discarded again.

The pellet was then washed from the falcon tube to a COD tube with 20 mL
of  propylene  carbonate  and  incubated  at  130  ºC,  for  at  least  15  minutes,  with
periodic shaking. These solutions were vacuum filtered afterwards with fiber glass
filters  (0.45  µm  of  pore  size,  binding  agents  free)  pre-warmed  with  propypylene
carbonate  at  130  ºC.  The  COD  tubes  and  filters  were  washed  with  additional  20
mL of warm propylene carbonate. The filtered solution was stored in schott bottles
and the PHA was precipitated with 4 volumes of cold methanol.

After one day, the precipitated PHA was vacuum filtered with pre-weighted
fiber glass filters. The cakes were washed with methanol in order to remove traces
of  propylene  carbonate  and  dried  overnight  at  105  ºC.  After  cooling  down  the
filters were weighted again in order to access the amount of material recovered.

3.3 Analythical methods

3.3.1 Biomass Quantification

 Biomass was quantified gravimetrically through the determination of Total
Suspended Solids (TSS), Volatile Suspended Solids (VSS) and Stored Lipidic
Biomass (SLB) / PHB content.



38

TSS was determined as the remaining residue of a sample after drying at 105
°C, from which the suspended matter was previously separated from the medium,
normally through filtration [64].

VSS  was  determined  as  the  part  of  TSS  that  volatizes  at  600  °C.  This  is
considered to represent the organic fraction of the sample [64].

Stored lipidic content (SLB)  was determined as the part of TSS that volatizes
at  250  °C.  This  method  was  developed  at  Avecom  previously  to  this  work  and  is
considered to represent the PHB content in the samples. This method was only
used  throughout  Chapter  4  and  was  then  replaced  by  the  method  for  PHB
quantification by extraction with propylene carbonate.

3.3.1.1 TSS

 Samples of 20 mL were collected from the biorreactors into 50 mL falcon
tubes. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm, for 10 minutes in a Eppendorf
Centrifuge 5810. The supernatants were then discarded and the pellet was
resuspended in demineralized water. Next, the resuspended pellets were
centrifuged again using the same conditions as before, after which the supernatant
was discarded again.

The pellet was then transferred to dry porcelain crucible, pre-weighet using a
Sartorius  TE64  Analytic  Balance.  After  that,  the  crucibles  with  the  samples  were
dried overnight in a oven from Memmert at 105 °C. Next day, the crucibles were
let  to  cool  down  in  an  exicator  for  one  hour,  before  weighting  them  again.  TSS
content  was  given  by  the  difference  between  the  porcelain  crucible  with  the  dry
matter  and  the  porcelain  crucible  as  such,  divided  by  the  volume  of  sample
(Equation 1, Appendix B).

3.3.1.2 VSS

VSS was quantified after the determination of the TSS from the samples. For
that,  the  crucible  with  the  dry  matter  was  placed  in  a  Nabertherm  GmbH  LE
4/11/R6  incinerator  at  600  °C  for  2  hours.  After  cooling  down  in  an  exicator,  the
porcelain crucible was weighted and the PHB content was given by the difference
between the weight of the crucible with the dry matter and the weight of the
crucible with the ashes, divided by the sample volume (Equation 2, Appendix B)



39

3.3.1.3 PHB quantification as SLB

When SLB determination was needed, this step was performed  between TSS
and VSS determination. After determining TSS, the porcelain crucible with the
dried biomass was placed in a  Nabertherm GmbH LE 4/11/R6 incinerator at 250
°C  for  2  hours.  After  cooling  down,  the  porcelain  crucible  was  weighted  and  the
amount  of  SLB  was  given  by  the  difference  between  the  weight  of  the  crucible
with  the  dry  matter  and  the  weight  of  the  crucible  with  the  remaining  biomass
after 250 °C, divided by the sample volume (Equation 3, Appendix B)

VSS could be determined afterwards, using the procedure described
previously.
3.3.1.4 PHB quantification by extraction with propylene carbonate

 PHB was quantified gravimetrically after extraction with 1,2-propylene
carbonate (Equation 4, Appendix B), using a procedure developed at Avecom
during this disseration. The method consisted of cellular lyses by freeze and thaw
cycles, followed by the extraction of PHB using 1,2-propylene carbonate. This
procedure was described above, in Chapter 3.2.4 - Development of a new method
for PHB quantification. This method is discussed further in Chapter 7.

3.3.2 pH

The pH of the samples was measured using the pH meter Consort C535.

3.3.3 Dissolved oxygen (DO)

The dissolved oxygen of the reactor was measured using the meter WTW Oxi
315i.

3.3.4 Soluble Chemical oxygen demand (COD)

Chemical  oxygen  demand  was  measured  photometrically  with  a  HACH
Lange DR3900 Photometer using the commercial kits LCK 014 and LCK 514 as



40

indicated by the manufacturer. The samples were previously centrifuged at 10000
rpm for 10 min (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810) in order to remove suspend solids.

3.3.5 Total nitrogen (TKN)

Total nitrogen was measured photometrically with a HACH Lange DR3900
Photometer  using  the  commercial  kit  LCK  338  as  indicated  by  the  manufacturer.
The samples were previously centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min (Eppendorf
Centrifuge 5810) in order to remove suspend solids.

3.3.6 Ammonium (NH4+-N)

Ammonium (NH4+-N)  was  measured  photometrically  with  a  HACH  Lange
DR3900 Photometer using the commercial kits LCK 302 and LCK 303 as indicated
by the manufacturer. The samples were previously centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10
min (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810) in order to remove suspend solids.

3.3.7 Nitrate (NO3--N)

Nitrate (NO3--N)  was  measured  photometrically  with  a  HACH  Lange
DR3900 Photometer using the commercial kits LCK 339 and LCK 340 as indicated
by the manufacturer. The samples were previously centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10
min (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810) in order to remove suspend solids.

3.3.8 Orthophosphate-phosphorus (PO4-3-P)

Orthophosphate-phosphorus (PO4-3-P) was measured photometrically with a
HACH Lange DR3900 Photometer using the commercial kit LCK 348 and LCK 350
as  indicated  by  the  manufacturer.  The  samples  were  previously  centrifuged  at
10000 rpm for 10 min (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810) in order to remove suspend
solids.



41

3.3.9 Volatile fatty acids (VFA)

The concentration of VFA was determined by the standard method of
partition of the VFA from samples using diethylether, followed by gas
chromatography analysis of the organic phase as described in [81].

 For this 2 mL of sample, 0.5 mL of H2SO4 solution, 0.4 g of NaCl, 0.4 mL of
internal standard solution (2-methyl hexanoic acid) and 2 mL of diethyether were
introduced  into  a  centrifuge  tube.  The  tubes  were  then  mixed  for  2  min  and
centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 minutes (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810). Subsequently,
the  etheric  layer  was  transferred  into  a  GC  vial,  in  which  the  short  chain  fatty
acids (SCFA) were extracted.

 The extracts (1 µL of extract) were analyzed using a GC-2014 gas
chromatograph,  equipped  with  an  Auto  injector  AOC-20i  and  an  auto  sampler
AOC-20s, all from Shimadzu. The temperature profile was set from 110 to 165 ºC,
with  a  temperature  increase  of  6  ºC  per  minute.  The  temperature  of  the  injector
was 220 °C, and the temperature of the sampler was 200 ºC. Nitrogen was used as
a carrier gas.

4.1 Background

In some european countries is not uncommon that private companies
produce  and  sell  electricity  from  renewable  sources,  as  a  complement  to  their
main  activity.  One  example  of  this  is  the  generation  of  electricity  by  the  burn  of
biogas from the anaerobic treatment of wastewaters or by wind turbines.

 However, electricity production has to be toughly controlled, since it cannot
be stored in a significant way. Its production must always correspond to the
amount being consumed. Otherwise the grid would be over or under charged. As
a  result,  sometimes  the  biogas  has  to  be  flared  or  the  wind  turbines  stopped  in
order  to  avoid  electric  peaks  in  the  grid  thus  wasting  a  significant  amount  of
energy,  that  could  be  valorised [82]. Furthermore, outside peak hours electricity
value is only of 0.05 €/kWh [83].

 It  would  be  interesting  to  valorise  these  surplus  of  energy  and  cheap
electricity. One possibility is to use this electricity in the electrolysis of water
towards molecular hydrogen and oxygen [84]. Some microorganisms can use
molecular hydrogen as an energy source in their metabolism. If these
microorganisms  are  capable  of  growing  and  deliver  a  product  with  high  value,
then this process can be economically feasible.

 The use of molecular hydrogen as an energy source is widely described for
autotrophic microorganisms, who use inorganic carbon, such as carbon dioxide, as
a carbon source [50]. CO2 is  a  major  gaseous  waste  stream  in  industry  and  other
human  activities  and  plays  a  major  role  in  global  warming.  This  gaseous  waste
streams could be used to feed bacteria in bioreactors. Another source of CO2 could
be biogas, as it is represents roughly 35% of its composition, being the rest mainly
methane. If microorganisms could remove CO2 from biogas, its quality would be
upgraded.

Electrolysis  of  water  is  an  economical  and  environmental  friendly  process,
with an yield of 65 - 80%. At the maximum yield, 1 kWh of electricity generats 9.14
mol of H2, which correspond to 228 L of this gas at standard ambient temperature
and  pressure  (SATP).  This  is  equivalent  to  146  g  COD  generated  per  kWh  of
electricity consumed, since 1 mol of H2 has COD of 16 g [85].



43

In electrolysis, the distinction between cathode and anode is not based on the
electric charge applied on the electrode, but rather on the electronegativity of the
gas  formed.  Therefore,  the  cathode  is  where  the  hydrogen  gas  is  produced,
regardless being negatively charged and the anode is where the oxygen is formed,
although the electrode is positively charged. The anode (oxygen formation,
positively charged electrode) is typically made of nickel and copper, coated with
oxides of metals such as manganese, tungsten and ruthenium. While the cathode
(hydrogen  formation,  negatively  charged  electrode)  is  typically  made  of  nickel,
coated with small quantities of platinum [86].

The autotrophic production of PHA by pure cultures of C. necator was
already  demonstrated  in  the  literature  with  fairly  good  results.  It  was  possible  to
attain  a  biomass  concentration  of  69.3  g/L  and  a  PHA  concentrarion  of  54.6  g/L,
which represents a PHA content of 81.4 % (w/w). This was achieved after 92 hours
and the productivity was of 0.61 g.L-1.h-1 [87].  In another system, specially designed
for  high  KLa values (a value of 2970 h-1), the biomass concentration was 85.7 g/L
after  45  hours.  From  this  biomass  71.8  %  (w/w)  was  PHA,  which  corresponds  to
61.5 g PHA/L [88].  On  the  other  hand,  the  use  of  the  mixed  cultures  for  the
autotrophic production of PHB was already tried at Avecom with poor results
(results not published).

In  this  experiment  mixed  cultures  were  submitted  to  aerobic  dynamic
feeding conditions  in a H2 enriched media. The purpose of this was to find out if
the use of H2 may act as a selective pressure for the enhanced production of PHB.

4.2 Results and discussion

4.2.1 Growth reactor

The growth reactor was incubated with activated sludge from protein
processing factory's WWTP, which was operated in SBR. This represents a nice
source of activated sludge for the production of PHB, as the microbial community
is adapted to live under the transient conditions of a SBR system [18]

The  reactor  was  maintained  over  a  period  of  32  days.  The  evolution  of  the
biomass of the concentration the growth reactor can be observed in Figure 7.



44

Figure 7 - Biomass concentration as TSS and VSS and SLB content (g SLB/g VSS) in the Hydrocell's
growth reactor at the end of feast phase, over a period of 32 days . The dashed vertical lines indicate
the times when part of the mixed liquor was replaced by fresh activated sludge.

 During this time, there was a small, but rather constant increase in the VSS,
from 8.15 g VSS/L on day 0 to 11.49 g VSS/L on day 32. Simultaneously, there was
a  decrease  in  the  difference  between  TSS  and  VSS  values,  from  a  VSS/TSS  ratio
(Equation 6, Appendix B) of 58 % in day 0 to 83 % on day 28 which indicates that
non  organic  material  was  being  removed  from  the  reactor.  The  TSS  value
increased  abruptly  on  days  31  and  32  due  to  the  fragmentation  in  the  reactor  of
one of the aeration stones.

The highest verified specific growth (Equation 14 and 15, Appendix B) rate
was  of  0.09  h-1 on  days  18  (0  -  1  h  feast)  and  on  day  25  (0  -  2  h  feast),  while  the
average specific growth rate was of 0.06 h-1. These values fall far behind 0.19 h-1 [14],
that was the maximum value found in the literature, but it was close to the value
of  0.10  h-1 previously  reported  as  the  maximum  one [89]. This value was achieved
while  submitting  a  pure  culture  of Paracoccus pantotrophus (a PHA-producing
bacteria commonly present in WWTPs) to ADF conditons, in order to study the
effect of the feast and famine cycles [90].

This  maximum  value  of  specific  growth  rate   on  day  18  was  simultaneous
with  the  maximum  observed  VSS  yield  of  0.49  g  VSS/g  COD  (Equation  8,
Appendix  B).  Similar  yield  values  were  observed  on  days  3  and  5,  but  it  is  not
clear if in these days this was a result of the cellular growth or due to the storage
of PHB, as nitrogen consumption was not evaluated during these days. These

yield values, as well as the volumetric loading rate (Equation 12, Appendix B) and
sludge loading rate (Equation 13, Appendix B) can be observed in Figure 8.

Figure 8 - VLR, SLR and VSS Yields on the Hydrocell's growth reactor. The dashed vertical lines
indicate the times when part of the mixed liquor was replaced by fresh activated sludge.

The  observed VSS yield was highly inconstant, most likely due to the
changes in the hydraulic retention and the replacement of part of the growth
reactor mixed liquor with fresh sludge. Actually, the yields seemed to stabilize
after day 17, as the HRT and SRT started to be more tightly controlled.

There is not a clear explanation for what cause the low yield values on day 26
and 32. This seems to correspond to the days where the SLR was higher, with 0.41
g  COD/g  VSS  and  0.44  g  COD/g  VSS  respectively.  In  fact,  from  day  25  to  26  the
influent  concentration  was  increased  from   35  g  COD/L  as  acetic  acid  to  40  g
COD/L and on day 32 the influent concentration was already at 50 g COD/L.
Nevertheless this can be related either with the higher SLR, since it was already
showed that higher loading rates result in lower yields [91].

The loading rates were gradually increased after day 18, maintaining a feast
phase duration of 2.5 hours. This explains the increase in VSS already stated
previously. In fact the values of VSS are higher than those found in the literature,
where   a  value  of  6.8  g  VSS/L  can  be  taken  as  good  reference  for  this  type  of
system [21]. However, these high cellular concentrations are irrelevant if the
bacteria are not capable to effectively produce and store PHB.

The evolution of the PHB content, measured as a ratio between SLB and VSS
(Equation 7, Appendix B) can be observed in Figure 9. However, the quantification
of PHB as SLB revealed to be unreliable, as more extensively described in Chapter
7, so all the observations were made based on values that could be true or not.

Figure 9 - PHB content (measured as the ratio between SLB and VSS) in Hydrocell's growth reactor at
the end of feast phase, during a period of 32 days. The dashed vertical lines indicate the times when
part of the mixed liquor was replaced by fresh activated sludge.

The  highest  SLB  contents  at  the  end  of  feast  phase  was  achieved  on  day  10
with  the  SLB  accounting  for  51  %  (w/w)  of  the  VSS.  However,  this  value  was
observed  after  a  considerably  extended  famine  phase,  due  to  a  malfunction  with
the feeding pump, which resulted in a F/F ratio of 0.04 h/h. The increased famine
phase  may  have  led  to  an  effective  selection  of  PHB-producing  bacteria,  that  had
the  polymer  stored  and  so  were  capable  of  surviving  without  an  external  carbon
source. When the normal reactor operation was resumed, the acetic acid fed must
have been rapidly for polymer synthesis in order to restore their PHB reserves,
since there was a strong internal limitation to growth [7].

On regular reactor operation, the highest value was verified on day 25 with a
SLB  content  of  31  %  (w/w).  This  value  was  gradually  increasing  since  day  19,
when the SLB content was only 20 % (w/w). This increase in SLB content
happened after the reactor's SRT and HRT started to be controlled more
judiciously  and  with  the  increase  of  the  loading  rates,  as  observed  for  VSS.

Therefore,  the  increase  on  VSS  during  this  time  was  mainly  due  to  the  increased
capability of the sludge to store PHB.

However,  on  the  next  day,  the  SLB  content  decreased  to  17  %.  This
corresponds  to  the   first  day  of  feeding  with  40  g  COD/L  Appendix  A.  The
decrease in the SLB content justifies the low observed VSS yield value, however
this does not add extra clues to what might have happened.

The  analysis  of  nitrogen  concentration  in  the  medium  that  day  revealed  a
concentration  of  40  mg  N/L  before  the  beginning  of  the  feast  phase,  which
indicated some accumulation of nitrogen in the reactor. Since there was a
significant  increase  in  the  VSS,  while  the  SLB  contents  stayed  low,  it  is  valid  to
propose that concentration of nitrogen led to a shift in the metabolism, from PHB
accumulation to growth.

However,  this  was  against  what  was  observed  from  day  31  to  32  with  an
increase in the SLB content from 16 % to 26 %, even with a small decrease in VSS.
The nitrogen concentration on day 32 was evaluated again prior to feeding and the
it  was  100  mg  N/L,  which  clearly  shows  that  nitrogen  was  indeed  accumulating,
but does not seem to be related with the decrease in the SLB content.

Looking to the results as a whole, it seems that the capacity of the bacteria to
produce  and  store  PHB  was  not  enhanced  over  time.  The  average  SLB  content  at
the end of feast phase was only of 25 %, while this value was of 26 % on day 0. In
fact,  this  was  exactly  the  same  value  as  the  one  verified  on  day  32.  This  could
mean that the conditions applied in the growth reactor may have not been
sufficient for an effective selection of PHB-producing bacteria. However, the way
that the growth reactor was operated was not designed for a significant
accumulation in PHB and so accumulation tests where necessary to determine the
capacity of the sludge to store PHB.

4.2.2 Batch accumulation tests

 On days 3 and 10 autotrophic accumulation tests were started
simultaneously with a heterotrophic ones, so it was possible to compare the
results. However, the heterotrophic accumulation test started on day 3 overflowed
without being possible to retrieve any values, therefore a new heterotrophic test
was started on day 4.

4.2.2.1 Acetic acid

The first accumulations test under heterotrophic conditions was started on
day 4. The results of this test are exhibited on Table 4.

 The SLB/VSS ratio more than doubled in the first heterotrophic test, from
19%  at  0  hour  to  40%  of  SLB  content  after  24  hours.  Although  there  was  some
cellular  growth,  as  the  total  non-PHB  cellular  mass  (Equation  5,  Appendix  B)
increased  from  5.92  g  to  6.56  g,  this  only  accounted  for  17  %  of  the  VSS  growth.
The PHB production yield of 0.30 g SLB/g COD (Equation 9, Appendix B)  was in
the range found in the literature for the production of PHB by mixed cultures, 0.25
-  0.56  g  PHB/g  COD [14],   although  closer  to  the  lower  value.  The  specific
production  rate  however  was  of  0.02  g  SLB.g  NPCB-1.h-1 which  is  way  below  the
values found associated with those yields, that vary between 0.14 and 0.65 h-1 [14].

The activated sludge used on this test already presented a high SLB content
prior  to  the  accumulation  phase.  This  happened  by  coincidence,  as  this  was  the
day in which a higher SLB content (51% of the VSS) was verified at the end of feast
phase  in  the  growth  reactor.  Probably  due  to  this,  there  was  not  a  significant
increase in the SLB content over time, changing from biomass SLB content of 51 %
at 0 hour to a maximum of 59 % after 5.5 hours. Nevertheless, the PHB production
yields of 0.30 g SLB/g COD observed at that time was equal to that observed after
24 hours in first accumulation test and so, it is also in range with the values of the
literature.  There  was  also  a  increase  in  the  volumetric  productivity  and  specific
production rate regarding the first test, but the values are still lower than the ones
on the literature.

It is proposed that these low specific production rates are the result of a poor
selection for PHB-producing bacteria in the growth reactor, as 10 days may not be
enough  to  effectively  change  the  microbial  community.  This  may  be  particularly



50

true having into account the high HRT and SRT applied and the recurrent
addition of fresh unaclimated activated sludge in the growth reactor.

There was no apparent reason for the decay in SLB content after 22 hours. It
is  possible  to  verify  a  decrease  in  the  amount  of  COD  fed  per  time,  but  this  was
probably related with a decrease in the acetate consumption rate, as the PHB-
producing bacteria were becoming saturated. Furthermore, the SLR after 22 hours
was  above  1  g  COD.g  VSS-1.d-1 and  the  feeding  control  seemed  to  be  working
normally,  so  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  the  decrease  in  the  SLB  content  was  due  to
bacteria starvation. It is possible that this unexpected value was caused by the lack
of reproducibility of the method used to determine the SLB. This problem was
only detected afterwards and willl aborded more extensively in Chapter 7.

The maximum SLB content of 31 % (g SLB/g VSS) was verified after 21 hours,
with a yield of 0.15 g SLB/g COD as H2. After this, the  SLB content decrease to the
same  verified  at  0  hour.  Furthermore,  the  increase  in  the  amount  of  SLB  in  the
reactor  was  not  followed  by  an  increase  in  VSS,  as  it  would  be  expected.  In  fact,
VSS  decreases  in  all  the  observed  times.  If  the  increase  in  SLB  was  not  due  to  an



51

error in its determination, it is only possible to assume that the cells that weren't
capable of live in the absence of an organic carbon source died and were lysed by
the others. This may imply that the increase in SLB was not due to the autotrophic
accumulation  of  PHB  but  rather  to  the  used  of  the  cellular  debris  by  the  living
cells.

The trial carried out on day 10 shows a decreased in SLB with time, while the
VSS remains considerably stable. This seems similar to the behaviour verified
during  a  famine  phase  under  excess  of  nutrients,  as  the  stored  PHB  seems  to  be
gradually consumed while cellular growth is occurring [7].

5 Production of PHB by ADF

5.1 Background

The production of PHB by submitting mixed cultures to aerobic dynamic
feeding conditions had already been researched at Avecom. This research result in
the scale up of the process to pilot scale, as part of a project for the profitable
treatment of waste water. The objective was to obtain a viable alternative to the
production of methane through anaerobic digestion.

Trials revealed a satisfactory capability of the biomass to accumulate PHB
(data  now  shown).  However,   the  system  was  highly  unstable  and  the  biomass
concentration decayed overtime. This required the frequent addition of fresh
sludge in order to maintain the process. After some months running the pilot and
formulating a dried biomass product from the withdrawn mixed liquor, the
project  was  ceased.  In  this  way,  other  lines  of  research  could  be  followed.
However, the interest of new partner companies in the production of biopolymers
led to the restart of the development and production of PHB producing
technologies.

The objective of this work was to develop a system for the stable production
of PHB by mixed cultures in a two step system. The recovery and extraction of the
polymer  from  the  biomass  was  also  of  interest,  as  it  was  required  for  other
experiments.

5.2 Results and discussion

5.2.1 PHB production A

5.2.1.1 A - Growth reactor

Growth  reactor  A  was  operated  as  SBR,  without  settling  phase,  in  ADF
conditions. A F/F ratio of 0.45 was chosen as previous tests carried out at Avecom
showed  that  this  ratio  offered  a  good  balance  between  growth  and  the  capability
to store PHB (results not showed). This seems to be supported by the results found
in the literature regarding the F/F ratio [7].



53

The evolution of the biomass concentration in the growth reactor A can be
observed in Figure 10, while the VLR, SLR and biomass yield can be observed on
Figure 11.

There were significant fluctuations of the concentration of biomass
(measured as VSS) from day 0 to day 3. Upon inoculation, the concentration of
biomass in the reactor was of 5.25 g VSS/L. This value was lowered than expected
having into account other samples from the brewery WWTP, that usually ranged
between  10  and  15  g  VSS/L  after  being  decanted.  The  loading  rates  had  been
planned  for  high  cellular  concentration  and  so  they  were  excessive  for  this
concentration of biomass. Probably as a result, the biomass concentration
decreased to 4.09 g VSS/L on day 1. With the adjustment of the loading rates, there
was a increase in VSS on day 2 to 6.61 g/L, followed by another decrease to 5.7 g
VSS/L on day 3.

The  concentration  of  biomass  seemed  to  have  stabilized  between  day  3  and
day 6. By this time, it was verified that was possible to increase the VLR from 4.0 g
COD.L-1.d-1 to 5.8 g COD.L-1.d-1, as feast was lasting only 1h30. Initially, this led to
a  small  decrease  in  the  biomass  concentration  on  day  7  (5.09  g  VSS/L),  but  then
VSS gradually increased till 6.37 g/L on day 9.

On day 10 the VLR increased again, to 7.4 g COD.L-1.d-1. As previously, this
led to a decrease in VSS on day 10 to 5.54 g/L. During the next days, till day 13, the

VLR gradually decreased to 5.1 g COD.L-1.d-1, since the volume in excess was not
purged from the growth reactor and the same amount of COD was being fed each
cycle. However, during this time biomass concentration increased by 44 % to 7.71
g  VSS/L.  The  volume  in  excess  was  withdrawn  from  the  reactor  on  day  14,
increasing the VLR back to 7.4 g COD.L-1.d-1. This did not lead to a decrease in VSS
this time, in fact it increased to a maximum of 8.29 g VSS/L on the last day.

The decreases in the biomass concentration on days 7 and 10 may appear to
be  caused  by  some  of  required  microbial  adaptation  to  the  increased  VLR.
However,  this  is  probably  not  a  direct  consequence,  but  a  result  of  the  increased
SLR. On day 7 and day 10, the SLR was of 1.13 g COD.g VSS-1.d-1 and 1.33 g COD.g
VSS-1.d-1 respectively. This high SLR seemed to have caused metabolic inhibition
thus  slowing  down  growth  and  PHB  accumulation.  This  would  explain  the
decrease in VSS as a result of the dilution rate.

The  observed  yields  seemed  to  support  this  idea,  as  they  seem  to  vary  in  a
opposite way regarding the SLR. This was already verified in the literature where
higher loading rates, result in smaller yields [7]. During the time of the experiment
the minimal VSS yield value was of 0.01 g VSS/g COD, on day 1 for a SLR of 2.26 g
COD.g VSS-1.d-1,  but  this  was  before  the  loading  rates  where  in  fact  regulated  for
the initial concentration of biomass. After this was carried out, the minimum VSS
yield  was  0.09  g  VSS/  g  COD  (day  10,  1.33  g  COD.g  VSS-1.d-1)  and  the  maximum
VSS yield was 0.36 g VSS/ g COD (day 9, 0.91 g COD.g VSS-1.d-1). The average VSS

yield value was of 0.22 g VSS/ g COD. This observed VSS yield value falls short of
the  yield  value  of  0.43  g  VSS/g  COD,  using  fermented  olive  oil  mill  effluents  as
feedstock [25].

PHB was not quantified during this time. PHB quantification as SLB revealed
to be inaccurate and an alternative method was still being developed (Chapter 7).
So, to have a notion of how much carbon source was being used for growth or for
the production of PHB, non-PHA cellular biomass (NPCB) growth was quantified
stoichiometrically considering a chemical composition of C7H12O4N [3].

On day 13 a concentration of 2240 mg N/L as total soluble nitrogen was
verified  on  the  reactor,  revealing  that  nitrogen  was  pilling  up.  Influent  without  a
nitrogen source was used in the next 6 cycles and it was possible to observe that,
regarding the consumption of nitrogen, approximately almost all carbon source
had been converted to NPCB by the end of each cycle. This reveals that if PHB was
been produced during feast, than it was being successfully used for growth during
famine. On day 17, the concentration of nitrogen in the reactor by the end of
famine  was  0  g  N/L,  so  it  was  possible  to  observe  this  in  more  detail  in  the  next
cycle. After the initial feed pulse, nitrogen was almost completely consumed after
90  minutes,  while  there  was  still  1044  mg  acetate/L  in  the  medium,  tanking
another 60 minutes to being consumed. This carbon source was most likely mainly
converted into PHB. On the overall, during this cycle 43 % of the carbon source fed
seemed to have been directed towards the production of NPCB, while the
remaining 57% was used for cellular maintenance and the production of PHB.

5.2.1.2 A - Accumulation reactors

No accumulation tests were carried out with the sludge of the growth reactor
A, due to limitation in the available material, as most of it was being used for the
run of tests in parallel in others Avecom's R&amp;amp;D projects.



56

5.2.2 PHB production B

5.2.2.1 B - Growth reactor

Growth reactor B had similar operation conditions to those of growth reactor
A. However, in this case nutrient excess conditions were imposed, by increasing
the  N/COD  ratio.   This  was  expected  to  act  as  a  selective  pressure  in  order  to
enhance growth and to select for bacteria capable of produce PHB efficiently, in a
accumulation reactor, even in the presence of nutrients [7].

 The  reactor  was  maintained  over  a  period   of  31  days,  after  which  it  was
stopped. The evolution of the biomass concentration in the reactor can be
observed in Figure 12.

The concentration of TSS and VSS decreased considerably from 17.28 g VSS/L
on  day  0  to  5.16  g  VSS/L  on  day  15.  It  was  expected  that  the  biomass  recovered
from growth reactor A would be dead and so it would be washed away with time.
Thus, its concentration should be meaningless after day 5, as a result of the SRT of
4.33 days. Nevertheless, VSS continued to decrease at a similar rate even after this
point.  It  was  not  predicted  that  the  applied  parameters  would  result  in  wash
conditions, since a similar SRT had been used in growth reactor A. Hence, it was
expected that the biomass concentration in the reactor would eventually stabilize,
when the VSS concentration reached normal value for this type of systems.

On  day  7  and  14  the  biomass  was  recovered  from  the  withdrawn  mixed
liquor by centrifugation and reinocculated back again in the growth reactor. These
were attempts to maintain high cellular concentrations in the reactor. Yet, they
proven to be useless as the biomass continued to decrease.

The  VLR  was  regulated  along  the  time  in  order  to  approach  the  SLR  of
values close to 1 g COD.g VSS-1.d-1. Their evolution during the experiment, as well
as the yields, can be observed in Figure 13. The low SLR form day 0 to day 3 could
help  explain  the  decrease  in  biomass.  Nevertheless,  after  this  day  the  SLR  value
was high enough, so it was possible to prevent the biomass concentration from
decreasing,  which  only  happened  after  day  15.  Thus,  the  decrease  in  biomass
concentration appears to be caused by growth inhibition due to a limitation in
oxygen, since the reactor was inoculated with a high concentration of biomass an
high loading rates were applied. In fact, during this period, a DO of 0 mg O2/L was
measured during the entire time of feast. In oxygen-limiting conditions, the carbon
source is diverted from the TCA cycle to other metabolic pathways, like those
leading to the production of PHB, as described in Chapter 2.5.

Nevertheless, this might have had other consequences as unidentified white

uptake  and  so  it  was  pilling  up.  The  white  layer  may  be  in  fact  exopolymer
produced  by  bacteria  as  a  stress  mechanism,  in  order  to  protect  them  from  this
high concentrations of ammonium and other nitrogen compounds. This
exopolymer most likely required a carbon substrate to synthesize and thus it may
have hindered the capacity of the reactor to select for PHB-producing bacteria.

Several  measures  were  taken  in  order  to  correct  this  situation.  Firstly  the
COD  concentration  in  the  influent  was  reduced  from  40  g  COD/L  to  25  g  COD/L
without neither a nitrogen nor a phosphorus source. This would diminish the
concentration of phosphorus and nitrogen on the reactor, while the lower VLR
would require a lower amount of oxygen for the acetate to be consumed.
Furthermore,  it  was  verified  on  that  day  that  the  feed  with  40  g  COD/L  was
tanking  already  taken  3h30  to  be  consumed.  On  day  11  the  influent  volume  fed
per cycle was split into 2 equal feed pulses instead of a only one. This way a lower
amount  of  COD  was  fed  per  pulse,  resulting  in  lower  concentration  of  acetate  in
the medium, and requiring less oxygen for that given time.

The number of feed pulses was rearranged again on day 15, dividing the feed
volume in 3 equal feed pulses, which reduced the feast phase for less than 2 hours.
Thus,  it  was  possible  to  gradually  increase  the  loading  rates  over  the  next  days.
This  was  followed  for  an  increase  in  the  concentration  of  biomass  from  3.79  g
VSS/L  on  day  15  to  6.26  g  VSS/L  on  day  18.  This  concentration  was  more  or  less
maintained  till  day  23  (6.00  g  VSS/L),  decreasing  almost  linearly  afterwards  till  a
biomass concentration of 2.26 g VSS/L was achieved on day 28. During the period
where the biomass concentration was relatively stable, the average observed yield
was  of  0.23  g  VSS/g  COD  which  is  similar  value  to  that  observed  for  growth
reactor. Nevertheless, during the phase where the concentration of VSS increased,
this yield rises to an average value of 0.39 g VSS/g COD which is close to the yield
value  of  0.43  g  VSS/g  COD,  using  fermented  olive  oil  mill  effluents  as  feedstock,
found in the literature [25].

On  day  28  the  biomass  was  recovered  from  the  mixed  liquor  by
centrifugation at 3.000 rpm for 10 minutes and re-incubated in the reactor with 2 L
of  fresh  activated  sludge.  This  was  carried  out  in  order  to  increase  the  biomass
concentration and basically do a reset in the selection process for PHB-producing
bacteria.  A  decrease  in  VSS  was  observed  in  the  next  few  days,  but  it  was  not
possible to verify if it would stabilize after sometime or duplicate the previous
behaviour, as the reactor overflowed on day 31.

5.2.2.2 B - Accumulation reactors

Five different accumulation tests were carried out in fed-batch reactors. This
time a time controlled feed pulse strategy was preferred over the pH-stat method.
This way it is possible to define the amount of carbon source fed and when should
it be fed, allowing a tighter control of the accumulation reactors.

The  influents  used  were  composed  of  acetic  acid  /  sodium  acetate  and
ammonium chloride in a COD/N ratio of 100/1 in days 2, 7 and 10 and of 100/2 in
days 15 and 21 in order to test the capability of the sludge to accumulate PHB in
the presence of this nutrient.

There was a significant increase in the VSS concentration, with a yield of 0.37

g  VSS/g  COD.  Hover,  only  0.06  g  PHB  were  produced  per  gram  of  COD.  The

initial  PHB  content  of  2%  (PHB/VSS)  was  quiet  low  for  a  sludge  sample  taken

from the growth reactor at the end of feast and its increase during the

accumulation fed batch was meaningless.

As a result, another accumulation test was carried on day 7 and day 10.

The results of these test were similar to the first one, with the VSS increasing
considerably, but not as a result of PHB storage. In the accumulation test started
on day 10 it was possible to verify an increase in the "white layer" described in the
growth reactor section. At that time the presumable exopolymer had not yet been
associated with the high concentrations of nitrogen in the medium. The
"exopolymer" and its amount before and after the accumulation test can be
verified on Figure 14.

Figure 14 - Pellet of the mixed liquor sample of the growth reactor (left) and from the accumulation
reactor (right) after centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for tem minutes.

  This image shows that the increase of VSS is mostly due to the production
of this "exopolymer". The results of the accumulation tests on days 15 and 21 were
very similar to the ones above, since the cause of this stress mechanism was not
corrected. The results of this accumulation tests can be verified on Appendix C.

5.2.3 PHB production C

5.2.3.1 C - Growth reactor

The evolution of the biomass concentration in the growth reactor A can be
observed in Figure 15 while the VLR, SLR and biomass yield can be observed on
Figure 16.

Figure 15 - Evolution of the concentration of TSS and VSS over a period of 15 days.

The  reactor  was  inoculated  with  activated  sludge  having  a  biomass
concentration of 2.7 g VSS/L. This value increased linearly over the first two days
till a VSS concentration of 4.3 g/L on day 2. On day 1 it was verified that the feast
phase was lasting  for 3h30 and so the volumetric loading rate was lowered from 6
g COD.L-1.d-1 to 4.3 g COD.L-1.d-1.

VFA  analysis  on  day  2  showed  that  the  concentration  of  acetic  acid  on  the
medium  at  the  end  of  each  feed  pulse  was  minimal,  allowing  the  increase  of  the
VLR  to  6.3   g  COD.L-1.d-1 for  day  3.  This  resulted  in  a  decrease  in  the  biomass
concentration, to 3.1 g VSS/L. Nevertheless, the VFA analysis clearly showed that
the acetic acid was almost completely deployed at the end of each feed pulse. This
behaviour,  both  on  day  2  and  day,  3  indicated  that  the  acetate  uptake  rate  was
being equal to the feeding rate. Therefore, if the decrease in the VSS concentration
on  day  3  was  caused  by  substrate  inhibition  in  the  first  two  cycles  of  the  day,  it

seemed that the microbial population managed to adapt to the imposed loading
rates and the VLR was maintained.

Figure 16 - Volumetric and sludge loading rates over a period of 15 days

There  was  a  significant  increase  in  VSS  from  day  3  to  7  with  the  biomass
concentration  almost  doubling,  from  3.1  g  VSS/L  to  6.0  g  VSS/L.  By  maintaining
the VLR it was possible to maintain a stable concentration of biomass in the
reactor  till  day  13.  Hence,  stabilizing  the  SLR  between  1.05  and
1.12 g COD.g VSS-1.d-1 and  the  yields  at  an  average  of  0.27  ±  0.05  g  VSS/g  COD.
The uptake rates continued equal to the feed rate during this time.

From  day  13  to  day  14  the  HRT  and  SRT  was  changed  from  3.5  to  3.0  days,
by increasing the volume of influent fed to reactor and consequently withdrawn
from in, for 1.2 L to 1.5.  No alterations were made to the influent concentration as
so,  as  a  result,  this  led  to  an  increase  in  the  VLR  to  7.3  g  COD.L-1.d-1.  It  was
expected that by reducing the HRT and SRT growth would be estimulated, but the
opposite happened. All this together led to a significant decrease in the biomass
concentration, reaching a minimum value of 2.50 g VSS/L on the last day.

reactor. However, in this case there was not production of the "exopolymer" in the
growth reactor and the concentration of nitrogen in the medium was more
controlled. The importance of these tests was to assess the influence of a nitrogen
source  in  the  accumulation  of  PHB.  Some  articles  state  that  presence  of  a  small
concentration of nitrogen, for example in a COD/N ratio of 100/1 enhances the
production  of  PHB  in  pure  cultures  of Cupriavidus necator. This happened as
nitrogen is required for the enzimes responsible for the polymerization of PHB [92].
Since mixed microbial cultures produce PHB mainly by an internal limitation
mechanism [7], this should not compromise the results.

The accumulation test was started with the biomass having a PHB content of
7 % (g PHB/g PHB) which is quiet low having into account the sludge was at the
end  of  feast.  This  value  increased  to  28  %  (g  PHB/  g  VSS)  after  22  hours  of
accumulation which is a rather low value for a microbial population acclimated to
ADF conditions. Both the yields and the productivity rates were also considerably



65

low.  Another  test  was  run  in  the  next  day  exhibiting  a  similar  behaviour,  with
even lower results Appendix C.

A final test still using an influent with a COD/N ratio of 100/1 was ran on day
9 (Table 12).

The  biggest  difference  in  this  test  was  the  high  VSS  yield.  Nevertheless,  the
production of "exopolymer" was not verified in any of these accumulation tests.
The increase in VSS on this last test seemed to be a consequence of cellular growth,
since nitrogen was consumed in a stoichiometric proportion.

These reveals that the selected microbial population has little tolerance for
the production of PHB under nutrient excess conditions. This is may be caused by
the  short  SRT,  that  may  act  as  a  strong  selective  pressure  to  growth,  instead  of  a
PHB accumulation. This may result in a big handicap in a industrial process using
complex fermented stream, where there may be abundance of nutrients and short
SRT are desired.

Due to this observation, on the following fill ups no nitrogen source was
used on the influent, having acetic acid/acetate as the only nutrient. Two feeding
strategies  were  applied  during  the  several  fill  ups  in  order  to  compare  their
results. The first one was pH-stat method that was used to run a accumulation test
on  day  13  and  other  on  day  14,  where  the  influent  was  fed  automatically  to  the
reactor, every time the pH exceeded 8.2. This value was chosen as it was reported
that  the  use  of  pH-stat  at  higher  pH  values  resulted  in  a  high  PHB  content [93].
While the other strategy consisted of time controlled feed pulse feeding, where the
reactor was fed every 72 minutes (20 times per day) for 3 minutes, with a influent
flow rate of 6.66 mL.

The results of the accumulation test using the pH-stat method on day 13  are
present on Table 13.

There  was  not  a  significant  production  of  PHB  nor  a  significant  increase  in
the  PHB  content.  This  may  be  a  consequence  of  the  low  VLR,  since  there  was  a



67

decrease in the total VSS, which may indicate cellular starvation, although the SLR
was of 1.25 g COD.g VSS-1.d-1.  This is one problem of this method, as the COD fed
to the system cannot be imposed. As a result it may take a lot of time for the pH to
reach the value where more influent will be added, as this is influenced by the pH
of the influent and the buffer capacity of the reactor's medium.

Because of this on day 9, to fill ups were started in order to compare the feed
pulse  strategy  with  the  ph-stat.  In  this  day,  the  pH  of  the  influent  for  the  feed
pulse strategy was set to 5.5, while for the pH-stat the influent was set at pH 5.0.

It is possible to observe that both methods exhibited similar results and
very  decent  PHB  contents  were  achieved.  This  proves  that  the  pH  of  the  fresh
influent may have a tremendous impact on the performance of the accumulation
reactor if a pH-stat strategy is used. Nevertheless, both accumulation tests
revealed low yields and low productivity rates. This means that a lower amount of
COD could have been used to feed the reactors and probably in a shorter fed batch
run.

6 Production of PHB enriched SCP

6.1 Background

 Single cell protein (SCP) is the use of microorganisms as a feed/food source
of  protein.  This  concept  started  to  become  popular  in  the  60s  and  70s.  However,
changes in the economical landscape and mainly the resistance of the public to the
product led to a significant decrease in the development and investments related
to this technology.

 Nowadays, there is a renewed interest in the production of microbial
protein.  SCP  can  be  produced  in  a  economical  feasible  way,  by  using  waste
materials  as  substrates.  This  can  be  used  in  animal  feed  or  even  in  products  for
human consumption [94].  This way, costly conventional protein sources like soy- or
fishmeal  can  be  replaced  as  protein  supplements.  The  use  of  waste  as  a  negative
cost substrate  also benefits the economy of the process [95].

 PHB  enriched  mixed  cultures  could  be  used  as  a  protein  source.  This  may
seen contradictory, since the PHB is considered a lipid [4] and  would  therefore
decrease the value of the biomass [96].  However,  PHB  has  been  proven  to  have  a
highly positive influence on the gastrointestinal health [97-99].

 There are bacteria present in the intestine that can efficiently degrade PHB
into butyrate [97, 98]. This can be effectively absorbed by the intestinal bacteria or by
the  host  to  be  used  as  carbon  source  in  their  metabolism [98]. Studies performed
with  juvenile  European  seabass  showed  that  partially  feeding  them  with  PHB
enhances their growth [99]. Furthermore, other studies reveal that these compounds
and the enriched intestinal bacterial community result in an increased resistance
off the host to pathogenic agents [97, 98]. These factors are considerably relevant for
the industry of aquaculture as it allows better productivities and to minimize the
use of antibiotics for the control of diseases.

 Given those reasons, it was considered of economical interest to develop a
method to produce PHB enriched SCP for being used as fish feed.



70

6.2 Results and discussion

A  method  for  the  quick  production  of  a  large  quantity  of  PHB  enriched
single cell protein was necessary in order to produce enough fish feed so it could
be used in zootechnical trials. For that, it was defined that the PHB content should
be at least 20 % of the VSS.

It was demonstrated in the literature that unacclimated activated sludge
from  WWTPs  operated  in  SBR  could  store  PHA  if  submitted  to  feed  pulses  of
organic acids, even without previous selection [100].  This  way  it  is  not  possible  to
achieve high PHB contents, which would endear significantly the downstream
process if a pure product was desired, but allows high concentrations of biomass
slightly increased in PHB. This process was therefore considered suitable for the
desired goal, as it consisted in a simple way of producing PHB enriched single cell
protein.

The results of a first fed-batch test are presented in Table 6.

There  was  an  increase  in  the  PHB  content  from  14  %  to  21  %  (PHB/VSS)
which  fulfills  the  main  objective.  This  is  value  considerably  lower  than  the  PHB
contents  achieved  with  acclimated  sludge,  that  can  represent  50  %  of  the  VSS  or
even higher. Nevertheless, this method allows that high biomass concentrations
are  easily  obtained,  which  is  not  the  case  when  activated  sludge  is  submitted  do
ADF  conditions,  were  a  stable  reactor  operation  is  hard  to  maintain  for  high  VSS
values.  On  the  other  hand,  this  process  has  the  disadvantage  of  having  a  low
VSS/TSS  ratio,  while  in  the  selection  reactor  this  could  easily  achieve  a  value  of
0.85. This high ash content (the difference between TSS and VSS) can be a barrier
to the commercialization of this product as feed, both in terms of legislation and
quality control.

 The  observed yield of 0.15 g PHB/g COD consumed is below the ones found
in  the  literatures  for  the  production  of  PHB  by  unacclimated  activated  sludge
using  volatile  fatty  acids,  that  range  from  0.20  g  PHB/  g  COD  to  0.28  g  PHB  /  g
COD.  However,  around  50  %  of  the  acetic  acid/acetate  fed  was  not  consumed.
Excessive  feeding  of  a  carbon  source  was  already  discussed  in  the  previous
chapters as having a negative effect on the yields and even leading to inhibition of
metabolic  pathways.  Therefore,  it  is  rather  probable  that  this  could  be  increased
with a better optimization of the process.

7 Development of a new method for PHB
quantification

7.1 Background

The thermal instability of PHB during melt is a considerable drawback for its
use as substitute to nonbiodegradable polymeric materials in commercial products
[101].  PHB  starts  to  degrade  and  volatilize  at  temperatures  above  200  °C  and  more
significantly after 230 °C [101, 102].

The procedure initially used at Avecom for the determination of the PHB
content in the biomass  was based in this characteristic. Dried biomass samples, in
which the TSS was already determined, were submitted to a temperature of 250 °C
for 2 hours in an incinerator. It was considered that this was sufficient to volatilize
all PHB in the samples and that the weight loss was mainly due to this. This was a
quick, practical and economic method to estimate the PHB content of the activated
sludge  samples.   Nevertheless,  this  method  was  never  carefully  validated  and
with time it was possible to observe a huge standard deviation between replicas
(results not shown). Different incineration times were tried in order to refine the
method, but the increased reproducibility was followed by an increased
inaccuracy of the determination, most likely due to the volatilization of the NPCB.
Therefore, there was the need to implement another PHB quantification protocol
at Avecom.

The quantification of PHB is a challenging procedure, since it is hampered by
the complexity of the matrix and the relatively low content of the polymer,
especially in activated sludge [103].  Currently,  it  is  possible  to  quantify  PHB  by
NMR [104, 105], mass-spectometry [106] or, more commonly, by  gas chromatography [96,
107, 108].

The GC quantification is based on the acidic transesterification of PHB in the
presence of a chlorinated solvent (simultaneous extraction and derivatization)
followed  by  the  analysis  of  the  hydroxybutyrate  alkyl-ester  by  GC [96, 107, 108]. The
most common differences in this method are regarding the solvent used
(chloroform, dichloroethane or dichloromethane), the transesterification alcohol
(methanol or propanol) or in the reaction catalyst (sulfuric acid or HCl).

Although the high sensitivity and reproducibility of the method [109], its
drawbacks meant a technically difficult  implementation at Avecom. The method



73

is lengthy and requires the handling and disposal of harmful and highly pollutant
solvents [103].  Furthermore,  in  some  variations  of  the  method  PHB  recovery  is
inefficient  in  the  presence  of  water,  while  the  acids  and  cellular  debris  in  the
sample  cause  premature  GC  column  degradation.  This  can  be  avoided,  but  only
by introducing sample lyophilisation and an additional purification step to the
method [107], which increases the cost and complexity of the method.

Other quantification methods relying on HPLC or flow cytometry was not
possible due to the lack of the required devices. Because of this there was a need to
develop a quantification method to be used at Avecom. This method should be
relatively cheap, not recur to chlorinated or other high pollutant solvents and
preferably allow the  quantification of PHB without its destruction.

The development of a method based on the extraction of PHB by propylene
carbonate, fitted these three conditions. Unlike the chlorinate hydrocarbons, 1,2-
propylene carbonate presents a low toxicity and a high boiling point (240 ºC). This
way,  it  has  a  low  vapor  pressure  at  environmental  temperatures  and  its
evaporation  to  the  environment  is  avoided.  PHB  is  soluble  in  1,2-propylene
carbonate at temperatures higher than 100 °C even for short contact times,
allowing its separation from the biomass. After this step, methanol or ethanol
could be used in order to precipitate the dissolved PHB , that could then be
recovered by filtration or centrifugation. The methanol or ethanol could be easily
recovered  afterwards  by  distillation,  give  the  different  boiling  points.   A  PHA
recover  yield  of  95%  and  a  purity  of  84%  was  reported  for  the  extraction  from
Cupriavidus necator cells, without any pre-treatment. The extraction procedure was
carried out at 130 ºC for 30 min [76, 77]. These results are comparable to the values
obtained from chloroform extraction (94% yield and 98% purity) [9].

7.2 Results and discussion

The values of PHB quantificaiton by chloroform extraction and 1,2-propylene
carbonate  (PC)  for  two  different  samples  and  different  replicas  are  compared  in
Table 17.

Chlorofom extraction is currently used as a standard method for PHA
recovery in lab scale, so the values obtained with it were used as reference.

It is possible to verify in table 1 and 2 that the propylene carbonate extraction
allowed  to  obtain  a  higher  amount  of  PHA  form  the  pilot  fill  up  sludge  than  the



75

ones with chloroform. Furthermore, the method does not decrease its sensibility
and  reproducibility  when  different  volumes  of  sample  are  used.  Finally,  but  not
least, the methanol used in this method allows the removal of other oils from the
extracted  PHA,  so  a  higher  purity  is  expected.  This  seems  to  be  proven  by  the
values  obtained  from  the  brewery  sludge,  where  more  biomass  was  extracted  is
chloroform.

8 Conclusions

The use of mixed microbial cultures for the production of PHB in reactors
operated in ADF conditions was possible. However, relatively low biomass
concentrations were achieved, even when it was possible to obtain values higher
than the ones found in the literature.

The low biomass concentration is a limitation of the ADF conditions, since
the  loading  rates  are  limited  by  the  need  of  a  famine  phase.  Excessively  high
loading rates seemed to have a negative impact on the performance of the reactor
inhibiting growth and the production of PHB. This is clearly the main limitation
regarding  this  type  of  system,  for  its  appliance  at  an  industrial  scale.  It  was
possible to achieve better values using the Hydrocell system than by conventional
ADF conditions. However, the increased operation costs might not overcome the
advantages.

The  control  of  the  feed  by  the  levels  of  DO  may  play  a  key  role  in  the
development of new feeding patterns and in the control of this type of systems at
an industrial scale.

The  problems  regarding  the  production  of  PHB  under  nitrogen  excess
conditions revealed that this process cannot be used with any type of wastewaters.
As a result, their carefully selection must be carried out before the implementation
of a full scale process.

8.1 Hydrocell

A unusual high biomass concentration for mixed microbial cultures
submitted to ADF conditions was achieved. Furthermore, the biomass
concentration of the reactor was stable during the time of the experiment, without
major fluctuations in VSS, although the unstable HRT, SRT, VLR and SLR applied.

The  specific  growth  rate  of  0.09  h-1,  the  maximum  one  observed  in  the
Hydrocell's  growth  reactor,  is  in  range  with  the  data  found  in  the  literature.  The
maximum  observed  VSS  yield  was  of  0.49  g  VSS/g  COD  which  was  a  very  good
result, although the average VSS yield was only of 0.28 g VSS/COD.

A  good  capability  to  store  PHB  using  acetic  acid  as  a  carbon  source  was
observed,  with  a  maximum  PHB  content  of  59  %  of  the  VSS.  Although  the  low
productivity  rates,  this  was  achieved  with  PHB  production  yield  of  0.30  g  SLB/g



77

COD which was a very acceptable value. On the other hand, it was not possible to
significantly produce PHB under autotrophic conditions on the accumulation
tests.

8.2 Production of PHB by ADF

The  growth  reactors  on  this  system  were  less  stable  than  the  one  in  the
Hydrocell system, as the microbial population tended to decay with time..
Nevertheless  it  was  possible  to  achieve  a  stable  growth  reactor  during  PHB
production C, while stable conditions were imposed. This sensibility to the change
of conditions may due to the different system used, to the different source of
activated sludge or to both.

The biomass concentration of the growth reactor was similar to the values
found on the literature. In fact, the concentration of biomass in growth reactor A
was higher than the usual values, but the capability of microbial population to
accumulate  PHB  was  not  verified.  The  maximum  observed  VSS  yields  were  in
range with the literature.

High biomass concentrations are technically difficult to obtain or to apply in
growth reactors operated in ADF conditions, due to the limitations in the loading
rates  that  can  be  applied.  VLR  must  be  regulated  regarding  the  capability  to
provide oxygen to the medium, as a limitation in O2 result in lower uptake rates
and in an increased feast phase. While the SLR must be high enough to maintain
the concentration of biomass in the reactor, while higher values may inhibit
growth and PHB production. A SLR value close to 1 g COD.g VSS-1. d-1 seemed to
be appropriated for the growth reactor. The observed VSS yield usually decrease
when the SLR is increased, while they to increase when the SLR is decreased.

It is possible to increase the loading rates by splitting the feed volume
through  several  feed  pulses  during  feast  phase,  instead  of  a  single  one  at  the
beginning of feast. This results in the decrease of the amount of COD present in
the reactor at a given moment, thus requiring less oxygen to incorporate it. This
can be controlled by measuring the levels of DO in the reactor's medium.

The use of time controlled feed pulses during accumulation tests revealed to
be preferred over the pH-stat method, as it allows a direct control of the reactor
and the imposition of defined conditions. On the other hand, the pH-stat method
efficiency seemed to be highly influenced by the pH of the influent used, and most
likely by the buffer capability of the accumulation reactor's medium also.



78

The presence of high amounts of ammonium seem to select for bacteria other
than PHB-producing ones or to activate a stress response where an exopolymer
seemed to be produced. This stress mechanism most likely diverted the consumed
carbon source for other metabolic pathways rather than for PHB production

8.3 Production of PHB enriched SCP

It was possible to produce PHB enriched SCP using non acclimated activated
sludge,  by  feeding  a  relatively  high  biomass  concentration  with  acetic  acid.  This
may  constitute  a  simple  and  quick  method  to  originate  added  value  from
wastewaters, as this PHB enriched biomass may have an interesting nutritional
value.

8.4 Development of a new method for PHB quantification

A  method  for  the  quantification  of  PHB  using  1,2-propylene  carbonate  was
developed. This method was reproducibly and exhibited to be at least as accurate
as the one using chloroform for the extraction of PHB from biomass, followed by
gravimetric quantification.



79

9 Further work

The  economics  of  the  process  must  be  determined  in  order  to  see  if  this
process  could  in  fact  present  advantages  over  the  anaerobic  treatment  and  in
which circumstantiates. For this, distinct types of wastewater must be evaluate for
the production of PHB.

It is necessary to develop a strategy that can be applied in production of
PHB, as the control and optimization of this type of systems can be highly
difficult. More studies focused on the use of DO in order to control the process
must be carried out in the future.

New applications for PHB must be searched, as it can be more useful in other
areas rather than competing with other types of plastic. In these other areas the
price  of  PHB  or  PHB  enriched  sludge  may  be  an  advantage  rather  than  a
limitation.

A stronger proof of concept regarding the Hydrocell system and the
production of PHB enriched SCP must be developed in order for these systems to
become economically atractive.

The  development  of  a  quicker  method  for  the  quantification  of  PHB  using
non chlorinated solvents, preferably by GG or HPLC would be of great interest.

9.1 Hydrocell

The  obtained  results  should  be  confirmed  using  a  similar  system.  However,
in that study thiourea should be used in order to avoid nitrification. This is
necessary, as nitrifying bacteria are autotrophic [64] and the high biomass
concentrations may result of that.

The characterization of the microbial population selected using this
conditions would be of great interest in order to really understand the effect of
having an electrolysis reactor coupled to the growth reactor and to confirm if
hydrogen  gas  can  indeed  be  used  as  a  selective  pressure  for  PHB  production  by
mixed cultures.

Since  no  accumulation  tests  were  carried  out  after  day  10,  it  would  be
important  to  verify  if  the  capacity  of  the  bacteria  to  accumulate  PHB  would  be
affected by increasing the loading rates in the hydrocell's growth reactor.



80

9.2 Production of PHB by ADF

Tests using real wastewater efluents would be of great importance for the
activities of Avecom. This can change greatly in compositions and so a strategy for
the selection of PHB-producing bacteria capable of operate under different
nutrient conditions would be desirable.

It is necessary to develop a strategy that can be applied in production of
PHB, as the control and optimization of this type of systems can be highly
difficult. More studies focused on the use of DO in order to control the process
must be carried out in the future.

9.3 Production of PHB enriched SCP

The  production  process  must  be  optimized,  in  order  to  achieve  yields  and
productivity rates. The downstream of the process also need to be developed so a
stable, sterilized product can be delivered.

This  product  must  be  more  extensively  characterized  regarding  the  amount
of protein and amino acid composition, the ribonucleic an deoxyribonucleic acids
content, as well as carbohydrate and lipid content. Toxicity and contamination
tests must be also carried out in order to access for the safety of this product.

The introduction of extra steps that could lead to the increase of the VSS/TSS
ratio, maintaining the process simples and allowing high biomass concentrations
and yields would be highly desirable.

9.4 Development of a new method for PHB quantification

The  method  should  be  further  validated,  as  the  use  of  other  sources  of
activated  sludge  or  the  presence  of  certain  nutrients  could  affect  the
reproducibility and accuracy of the method. The results should also be compared
to those of more widely accepted methods like the protocols used for
quantification using GC or HPLC.



81

Economical and feasibility studies regarding the use of 1,2-propylene
carbonate as a solvent for the extraction and purification of PHB at industrial scale
should  be  carried  out  in  order  to  verify  if  they  can  be  indeed  used  as  a  viable
alternative to chlorinated solvents.

The  development  of  GC  or  HPLC  analysis  protocol  for  the  PHB
quantification using 1,2-propylene carbonate, or other non-chlorinated solvent, in
replacement of the chlorinated solvents used nowadays on those protocols would
be very useful.

On the fill up of day 15 to day 16 the COD/N ratio was changed from 100/1 to
100/2. The reactor was operated in the hot room, since is described in the literature
that a higher production of PHB is achieved with a temperature of 30 °C instead of
20 °C.

The  results  obtained  with  this  fill  up  were  even  worse  than  the  ones  of
previous week. The heat inside the warm room, causes an excessive evaporation
in  the  reactor,  that  may  negatively  affect  its  performance  and  the  difference  in
temperature  between  the  growth  and  the  fill  up  reactor  may  be  excessive  for  the
bacteria.



 C.2

The fill up of day 21 was carried outside the warm room. For this feel up, the

reactor every 72 minutes (it was intended to feed the reactor every 60 seconds, but

the timer used to control the feed pump doesn’t allow more than 20 programs).

For the second approach it was necessary to increase the volume fed per day from

100 mL to 125 mL.

The  fed  solution  was  composed  only  by  acetic  acid/acetate  and  ammonium

chloride in a COD/N ratio of 100/2. This solution was prepared so the volumetric

loading rate in the fill up reactor would be eight thirds (8/3) of the volumetric

loading rate of the growth reactor.

Appendix D : PHB Quantification - Standard
Operation Protocol

D.1 Background

 Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a type of endo-polymer synthesized by
bacteria. It quantification is usually a complicated process that requires highly
acidic conditions and temperature in order to hydrolyze the polymer chain. After
that, the monomers are further derivate to a compound possible to quantify
through gas or high pressure liquid chromatography.

Alternatively,  PHB  can  be  extracted  and  purified  from  the  remaining
biomass. However, this polymer is not soluble in most solvents and its susceptible
to hydrolysis, both on acid and alkaline conditions, makes its separation from the
cellular debris a difficult task. Chlorinated solvents are commonly used in lab
scale to extract and purify PHB. Nevertheless these solvents are highly pollutant,
toxic and even carcinogenic, so their use is highly undesirable.

 In this protocol 1,2-propylene carbonate is used as an effective way to
extract and purify PHB, without the drawbacks of chlorinated compounds. These
solvent requires a temperature higher than 100 °C in order to achieve an efficient
solubilization  of  the  PHB.  However,  its  high  boiling  point  (242  °C),  low  vapor
pressure at room temperature and non toxicity makes it a very easy solvent to
work with.

 This protocol consists of three steps, namely 1) cellular lyses and release of
the PHB chain; 2) solubilization of PHB and separation from the cellular debris; 3)
recover  and  quantification  of  the  PHB.  The  complete  procedure  is  described
below:

D.2 Cellular lysis

D.2.1 Material needed:
a) Hypochlorite solution (bleach) with 6% of active chlorine (20°);
b) Falcon tubes (one per sample)



 D.2

c) 20 mL sampling pipettes and pipette filler
d) Centrifuge

D.2.2 Method:
a) Withdrawn 20 mL of sample and centrifuge it for 10 minutes at 10,000 rpm.
b) Discard  the  supernatant  and  resuspend  the  biomass  in  20  mL  of  a

hypochlorite solution 20° (6% of active chlorine).
c) After 5 minutes, add 1 mL of H2SO4 1M in order to neutralize the pH of the

solution. This will protect the PHB from being hydrolyzed. The addition of
acid  may  originate  chlorine  gas  and  thus  should  be  done  inside  a  fume
hood.

d) Immediately centrifuge for 10 minutes at 10,000 rpm. Discard the
supernatant and rinse it with demineralized water. Centrifuge one more
time for 10 minutes at 10,000 rpm and discard the supernatant.

D.3 Dissolution of PHB and separation from the
cellular debris

D.3.1 Material needed:
a) 1,2-propylene carbonate (40 mL per sample)
b) Destruction tubes (1 per sample + 2 extra ones)
c) Heating plaque for destruction tubes at 130 °C
d) Glass vacuum filtration system
e) Fiber glass filters without binding agents, pore size of 0.47 µm
f) Cold methanol (~ 170 mL per sample)
g) 100 mL cylinder
h) 500 mL Schott bottles with stopper (1 per sample)
i) Tweezers

D.3.2 Method:
a) Resuspend the lysed biomass in 20 mL of 1,2-propylene carbonate and pour

it to a destruction tube.



 D.3

b) In  a  clean  tube,  add  20  mL  of  1,2-propylene  carbonate.  This  tube,  with
solvent  only,  will  be  used  to  warm  the  filtering  system  before  filtering  the
samples. This will avoid PHB precipitation due to the cool down of the
solvent.

c) In  another  clean  tube  without  biomass,  add  10  mL  of  propylene-carbonate
per each one of the samples. This will be used to wash the destruction tube
and filter after each filtration.

d) Warm all the tubes at 130 °C for at least 15 minutes, shaking the samples
every 5 minutes. The samples should remain at 130 °C till they are filtrated,
in order to avoid PHB precipitation.

e) In the meanwhile, prepare the vacuum filtration system.
f) After warming the samples for 15 minutes, use the extra tube with solvent

(prepared on step b) to warm up the filtering system, in order to avoid PHB
precipitation and clogging of the filter.

g) Take the solvent from the filtering erlenmeyer flask back to the destruction
tube  and  put  it  back  in  the  heating  plaque.  This  may  be  useful  later  on  if
more hot solvent is necessary.

h) Filter one sample and let it be filtered completely. Use 10 mL of hot solvent
to wash the sample tube and pour it on the top of the filter.

i) Recover the liquid in the filtration erlenmeyer to a Schott bottle and rinse
the flask with cold methanol (-20 °C). Pour that methanol to the Schott
bottle as well, till a final volume of ~ 200 mL. Methanol is added as an anti-
solvent, thus precipitating the PHB in the Schott bottles.

j) Repeat steps “h” and ”i” for the other samples still in the heating plaque.
Replace the fiber glass filter every time that necessary.

k) Let the content in Schott bottles to rest overnight.

D.4 PHB recovery

D.4.1 Material:
a) Vacuum filtration system
b) Drying oven at 105 °C
c) Freezer



 D.4

d) (Pre- weighted, unused) fiber glass filters without binding agents, pore size
of 0.47 µm (1 per sample)

e) Petri dishes (1 per sample)
f) Methanol (-20 °C)

D.4.2 Method:
a) Put unused fiber glass filters in Petri dishes and dry them overnight at 105

°C in order to remove any water.
b) Weight the filters after cooling down and register the value.
c) Use these filters to recover the precipitated PHB in the Schott bottles.
d) The  bottle  and  filter  should  be  washed  with  an  additional  methanol  in

order not to lose any PHB and to remove any trace of propylene carbonate.
e) Dry  the  filters  on  their  respective  Petri  dish  in  the  oven.  After  cooling

down, weight them again.
f) Calculate the concentration of PHB in the sludge sample.
