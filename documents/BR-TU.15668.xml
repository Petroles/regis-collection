ABSTRACT 

 

The performance of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) raised in cages furnished with an automatic 

dispenser, supplied at different frequencies (once per hour and once every two hours) and periods 

(daytime, nighttime and both) was evaluated. Eighteen 1.0m
3
 cages were placed into a 2000m

2
 pond,

 
two 

meters deep with a 5% water exchange. One hundred and seventy tilapias, with initial weight of 

16.0±4.9g, were dispersed into each 1m
3
 cage and the feed ration was adjusted every 21 days with 

biometry. Data was collected from March to July (autumn and winter). Significant difference to final 

weight (P&lt;0.05) among treatments was observed. The increase in feeding frequency improves the 

productive performance of Nile tilapias in cages and permitted better management of the food. The better 

feed conversion rate for high feeding frequency (24 times day
-1

) can result in saving up to 360kg of food 

for each ton of fish produced, increasing the economic sustenance for tilapia culture and suggesting less 

environmental pollution.

INTRODUCTION 

 

Manual feeding is the most used method in fish 

farming. However, the larger the production unit 

the more complex and onerous feed management 

becomes, due to the greater number of qualified 

people needed to detect changes in fish behavior 

and supply adequate ration.

The automatic fish feeders found on the market 

are manufactured with a device for launching the 

food long distances in the pond. These devices 

increase the cost of feeding and their use is too 

expensive for cages, where a feeder is necessary 

for each unit. However, there is an automatic 

feeder proposed by Agostinho et al. (2004) that 

is ideal for cages and costs four to five times less 

than the dispensers found in the market. This 

equipment consists of a container dimensioned 

according to the size of the cage, which releases 

the food in programmed periods and quantities. 

 

The correct feed management is essential for 

improving fish growth and homogeny without 

compromising health, since food in excess builds 

metabolic alterations, in addition to water quality 

deterioration. For filter fish species that naturally 

feed at a high frequency, small ratio portions 

with a greater daily frequency is recommended 

(Meer et al., 1997). Yao et al. (1994), analyzing 

the effects of feeding frequency in Plecoglossus 

altivelis (ayu), reported that the fish fed four 

times a day presented a lower triglyceride level 

than those fed only twice daily.  

 

Nutrient assimilation by tilapia is affected by the 

interaction between diet protein level or free 

amino acids and the frequency in which the 

animals are fed. The free amino acids are 

absorbed faster than the amino acids present in 

the protein that needs intestinal proteases to 

convert them into di or tripeptides to be absorbed 

by enterocytes. Only after this absorption are 

they broken into amino acids by specific di or 

tripeptidases, for subsequent transport to the liver 

and to the target tissues.  This process is slow 

and most of the free amino acids upon arrival at 

the target tissues are not used for protein 

synthesis anymore. The increase in feeding 

frequency efficiently supplies free amino acids 

while there are still amino acids from the prior 

feeding of protein diet (Lara, 2006). 

 

Three systems are normally used to supply ration 

in tilapia farming and fishes in general:  manual 

feeding, by demand and automatic. Automatic 

feeding ? frequency of 12 times per day ? for 

Nile tilapias this has presented superior results 

compared to other methods (Novato, 2000). 

Similar results were found for Dicentrarchus 

labrax (Azzaydi et al., 2000).  

 

Trials with tilapias (Oreochromis niloticus), 

rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), channel 

catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and African catfish 

(Clarias gariepinus) showed that these species 

also feed at night. However, this practice cannot 

be done in commercial fish farming, due to the 

high cost of manual labor. The use of the 

automatic feeder would permit an increase in 

feeding frequency and food supply at night. 

 

The feeding activity of tilapias is strongly linked 

to photoperiod, presenting greater activity at 

dawn and sunset (Toguyeni et al., 1997). Baras 

et al. (1995), studying juvenile of Nile Tilapia 

obtained a higher growth rate and better feed 

conversion for the nocturnal period than for fish 

fed during the day. 

 

Some authors observed that some species such as 

rainbow trout, fed with auto-feeders, show feed 

peaks at dawn and at nightfall (Boujard and 

Leatherland, 1992; Shima et al., 2003). 

Yamamoto et al. (2002) observed 7 to 9% 

activity in the first hours of night with demand 

feeders for this same species and, when 

submitted to automatic feeding, the fish ingested 

a superior quantity of food compared to self-

feeding. The ingestion peaks for this species are 

from 5-6 A.M. and  6-7 P.M. (Valente et al., 

2001). 

 

The efficiency of nocturnal feeding for 

fingerlings of African catfish was reported by 

Hossain et al. (2001). When fed at night (four 

times per night) with automatic feeders, they 

show better food conversion rate than those fed 

only during the day or during the day and at 

night. Thus, the present study had the objective 

of evaluating the performance of tilapia raised in 

cages, provided with automatic feeder, fed in 

different frequencies and periods. 

 

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

 

The experiment was carried out during autumn 

and winter in Brazil, from March, 17
th

 to July, 

21
st
 (126 days). Eighteen 1.0m³ cages arranged in 

line were placed in a 2000m
2
 pond

 
two meters 

deep with water renovation of 5 to 10%. The 

tilapias were acquired from a commercial fish 

farm. The initial density was 170 fishes/m³ with 

initial weight of 16.0±4.9 grams. The daily feed 

ration was based on live weight (from 7% initial 

to 2% at the end). The quantity of food was 



Sousa et al. 

194  Arq. Bras. Med. Vet. Zootec., v.64, n.1, p.192-197, 2012 

adjusted every 21 days, when the size and weight 

measurements were taken. The commercial 

rations offered, according to the manufacturer, 

were prepared with 32% protein, 10% moisture, 

3% fat, 5% fiber, 8% mineral, 1.8% calcium and 

0.8% phosphorus. The food offering for each 

treatment is shown in Table 1.

(*) Day = from 6am to 6pm; Night = from 6pm to

In order to reach the feeding frequency  

proposed, an automatic feeder was installed in 

each cage. The automatic feeder consists of a 

conic reservoir manufactured with impermeable 

material (glass fiber) containing an 

electromechanical mechanism that releases ration 

in pre-established intervals with a timer. The 

feed is dispensed into the interior of cages. Each 

automatic feeder holds four kilograms of food 

supplied twice a week.  

 

Fish biomass was estimated in a 21-day interval 

in order to accurate the food rate to be offered. 

Biometry consisted of 20-fish weight samples 

from each experimental unit; this fairly high 

significance level was used to reduce the number 

of stressed fishes related to the frequent 

samplings.  

 

The sampling began with the removal of ration 

from the automatic feeders to calculate the food 

intake during 21 days. The fish from the samples 

were weighed individually on an Instrutherm-

brand digital balance with 0.1g precision, and 

after weighing the tilapias were returned to their 

respective cages. The mean weight of each 

treatment was calculated to adjust the feed rate 

offered based on commercial tables for fish 

farmers reducing rate for heavier fishes when 

temperature is lower than 19
o
C (May 20

th
 to July 

21
st
) , Based on that, feed rate varied from 7.0% 

at the beginning to 2.0% at the end of the 

experiment. Animals were weighed six times 

during the experiment and all fish were weighed 

at the end of the period. 

 

During the experiment, limnological variables 

were determined [transparency (Secchi disc); pH 

(Oakton peagometer), temperature and dissolved 

oxygen DO (YSI 55)]. They were monitored 

daily in the morning, at three distinct points in 

the pond, according to the position of the in 

flowing water. In the first 21 days the pond was 

supplied with spring water, due to low initial 

outflow, providing a volume renovation rate of 

only 5%. After the first sampling, a new source 

of spring water was exploited to supply the pond, 

elevating the daily flow to 10%.  

 

The experiment was designed in a 2x3 factorial 

arrangement, in a total of six treatments with 

three replications. Data was compared using 

ANOVA with a model that considers the effect 

of feeding frequency, feeding period and the 

interaction between feeding frequency and 

feeding period. Duncan test at 5% probability 

level was used to compare the means. 

 

RESULTS 

 

The water temperature decreased from the 

beginning to the end of the experiment. Irregular 

variation in oxygen level in each pond was 

observed. Water transparency slightly decreased 

during the experimental progress and pH values 

demonstrated little variation from the beginning 

to the end of the experiment, assuming a 

tendency to alkalinity (Table 2). 

 

The tilapias raised in cages fed at different 

frequencies and periods showed statistical 

difference (P&lt;0.05) in performance evaluation. 

Table 3 presents final weights and feed 

conversion rates for the interaction between 

frequencies and periods. Despite the observation 

of an apparent relative difference in values 

between treatments, the feed conversion rates did 

not present statistical difference; the F value was 

too high for this variable in ANOVA test. During 

the first week of the experiment there was a 5% 

loss of juveniles, but this mortality was probably 

due to transportation stress, fish adaptation to the 

cages and difference in water quality, since the 

survival for the remaining period was 100%.

DISCUSSION 

 

As shown in Table 2 it is verified that dissolved 

oxygen levels in the pond found during the 

experiment were below the levels observed by 

Paes (2006), who found values of 8mg/L of 

dissolved oxygen in the water in Nova 

Avanhandava lake, where tilapias are raised in 

cages. According to Boyd and Tucker (1998) 

large periodic fluctuations in dissolved oxygen 

may reduce fish performance.  

 

The pH values showed little variation from the 

beginning to the end of the experiment, assuming 

a tendency toward alkalinity near to 7.8 at the 

beginning of the experiment and 8.1 at its 

conclusion. Water transparency decreased 

slightly during the course of the experiment, with 

an average of 45.0cm. This reduction may have 

occurred due to phytoplankton blooming 

(Sipaúba-Tavares, 1995).  

 

The weight gain results can be promising since 

the experiment was conducted in autumn and 

winter. The mean temperature shown in Table 2 

was below the ideal temperature for this species 

that, according to Kubtiza (2000), can range 

between 27 and 32ºC. 

 

It should be emphasized that the feed conversion 

rate for low feeding frequency (once every two 

hours) was 1.40 and for high feeding frequency 

(once per hour) was 1.04 (Table 3), which can 

result in saving 360kg of food for each ton of 

fish produced, increasing the economic 

sustenance for tilapia culture, additionally 

suggesting less environmental pollution. 

 

In the present study there was interaction 

between feeding frequency and period. For the 

feeding frequency of once per hour and once 

every two hours there was no significant 

difference on final weight of tilapias fed during 

the day period and the ones fed during day and 

night (Table 3). For the once per hour feeding 

frequency the performance of tilapias fed during 

the day-night period was higher than tilapias fed 

only at night (P&lt;0.05). For the once every two 

hours feeding frequency, the best performance 

was for tilapias fed during the day. The lower 

level of dissolved oxygen in water at night may 

have contributed to the inversion of better 

productive performances related to feeding 

frequency, since during feeding tilapias double 

their oxygen consumption.  

 

Correlated to feeding periods, the only 

significant difference for feeding frequency 

occurred in the day/night period, in which the 

once per hour frequency was superior to that of 

once every two hours for final weight (P&lt;0.05). 

This tendency matches the results obtained by 



Sousa et al. 

196  Arq. Bras. Med. Vet. Zootec., v.64, n.1, p.192-197, 2012 

several authors for different species (Tung and 

Shiau, 1991; Koskela et al., 1997; Novato, 2000; 

Padua et al., 2001). 

 

One common practice in commercial tilapia 

farming is a periodic classification to reduce the 

lack of uniformity among the fish in cages, 

which causes stress that generally results in 

mortality after handling. The results obtained 

during this experiment demonstrated greater 

uniformity in the treatment with a higher feeding 

frequency, confirming the results obtained by 

Koskela et al. (1997) for the species Coreogonus 

lavaretus and by Wang et al. (1998) for a hybrid 

sunfish. 

 

The data presented indicate that the increase in 

feeding frequency associated with daytime or 

day/night time feeding improved the 

performance of Nile Tilapia in cages, suggesting 

that a greater number of feeding permits better 

exploitation of feed and availability of dissolved 

oxygen. Additional studies should be conducted 

to better define feeding frequencies and periods 

for other species growth in national and global 

aquiculture, at the same time contributing for the 

sustenance of the activity.  

 

With the use of automatic feeders it was possible 

to supply the food in small portions improving 

the feed exploitation and reducing waste and 

competition for food.  According to Tsadik and 

Kutty (1987), food consumption and absorption 

by tilapias and their growth are influenced by the 

quantity of oxygen dissolved in the water.  

 

When feed is offered in higher frequencies the 

daily demand for oxygen is lessened. 

Furthermore, species such as tilapia, which 

possess a long digestive tract and omnivorous 

feeding habits, can take better advantage of the 

food nutrients when the feeding frequency is 

higher at the right time of the day, resulting in 

increased weight gain. Thus, a greater parceling 

of daily ration quantity is recommended for feed 

management for tilapias fed during the day or 

day/night. 

 

The fish performance from the nocturnal feeding 

period treatment, done with an automatic feeder, 

was significantly less than the other treatment 

performance (P&lt;0.05), in contrast to the data 

obtained by Baras et al. (1995) with juvenile of 

Nile Tilapia and by Kerduchuen and Legendre 

(1991), for Heterobranchus longifilis. However, 

the performance of tilapias fed only at night 

presented results which suggested that tilapias 

also feed at night.  This feeding habit was also 

observed for the rainbow trout by diverse authors 

(Boujard and Leatherland, 1992; Valente et al., 

2001; Shima et al., 2003; Yamamoto et al., 

2002). 

 

In the present study it can be observed that 

tilapias presented good exploitation of the food 

in all periods evaluated, with better results for 

high frequencies during day and night periods. 

Nevertheless, nocturnal feeding is not practiced 

currently in Brazil due to lack of studies, 

information and cost of manual labor.  

 

CONCLUSIONS 

 

The increase in feeding frequency improves the 

performance of Nile tilapia in cages and the 

greater number of feedings allows better food 

exploitation by the fish. It is suggested that 

during autumn and winter, to produce tilapia in 

the phases from 16.0 to 250.0g, ration should be 

supplied only during the day, turning off the 

feeders at night.
