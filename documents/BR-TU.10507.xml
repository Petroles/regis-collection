ABSTRACT

Volcanism is the cause of great non-anthropogenic perturbations on the Earth climate

through energy imbalance changes. There is still much to be uncovered relative to its

impacts on the Southern Hemisphere, even more with respect to the Southern Ocean. The

South Atlantic and its Southern Ocean sector response to volcanism are examined using

simulation results from the Last Millennium Ensemble Experiment of the Community

Earth System Model (CESM-LME), for the period 850-2005. Composite results point to

significant changes in sea surface temperature and salinity in the first austral summer

following the eruption. North of 60S, there is ocean cooling, as expected because of the

higher albedo related to the volcanic forcing. In contrast, near the Antarctic Peninsula

in the Weddell Sea, a local warming of ? 0.8?C is observed (significant at the 90% level).

Salinity shows positive anomaly (? 0.1) at the northern region off Antarctic Peninsula

from the first year after the eruption to the fourth subsequent year. Oceanic surface

anomalies weaken after the fifth subsequent year, however it is still present in deeper

layers (? 500m). At the same time, wind stress changes are evident, results show a

poleward shift (? 2?), strengthening (? 10%) of the prevailing westerlies and the reversal

in direction of the meridional wind stress component in the northern Antarctic Peninsula.

As consequence, there is intensification of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current southern

extension. Together with the stronger westerlies, the mixing in the northern Antarctic

Peninsula is enhanced, bringing up warmer subsurface waters, therefore explaining the

anomalous surface warming after the eruption. The 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption re-

sponse is also investigated. CESM-LME, observations and reanalysis have shown similar

behavior, however for the second subsequent year, thus suggesting the occurrence of the

same mechanism identified after Last Millennium eruptions.

RESUMO

Vulcanismo é uma das maiores causas naturais de mudanças no clima. Poucos estudos

tiveram foco no seu impacto no hemisfério sul, principalmente no Oceano Austral. Desta

forma, o impacto de erupções vulcânicas é investigado no Oceano Atlântico Sul incluindo

o seu setor austral, em resultados do modelo CESM-LME (Community Earth System

Model Last Millennium Ensemble) entre 850 e 2005. Os resultados utilizando composições

mostram mudanças significativas na temperatura e salinidade da superfície do oceano no

primeiro verão austral depois da erupção. Ao norte de 60S, há uma anomalia negativa

de ? ?0.8?C na temperatura em superfície, devido ao maior albedo após a erupção.

No entanto, próximo à Península Antártica no Mar de Weddell, é visto uma anomalia

positiva de ? 0.8?C (significativa a 90%). A salinidade apresenta mudanças importantes

entre o primeiro e o quarto ano após a erupção, com anomalia positiva (? 0.1) ao norte

da Península Antártica. A resposta ao vulcanismo em superfície desaparece no quinto

ano sequente, mas permanecem anomalias em profundidade (? 500m). O campo de

vento também se altera no mesmo ano, os ventos de oeste migram para sul (? 2?) e

se intensificam (? 10%), além da componente meridional inverter seu sentido ao norte

da Península Antártica. Como consequência, é observada intensificação da borda sul

da Corrente Circumpolar Antártica. Junto com isto, há aumento da mistura próximo à

Península Antártica, desta forma, águas subsuperficiais mais quentes afloram, explicando

a anomalia quente após a erupção. Finalmente, é verificada a ocorrência de resposta

similar após a erupção do Monte Pinatubo (1991). Resultados do CESM-LME tiveram

comportamento aproximado quando comparados com dados observacionais e reanálise.

O aquecimento próximo à Península Antártica é evidenciado no segundo ano após a

erupção, sugerindo a ocorrência do mesmo mecanismo do último milênio.

1 INTRODUCTION

Evidences of climate change such as increased surface atmospheric temperature, green

house gases (GHG) concentration, changes in precipitation pattern and increased sea

surface temperature (SST) have already been extensively documented (IPCC, 2013; Mc-

Gregor et al., 2015). About 90% of the Earth energy imbalance is stored in the global

ocean as ocean heat content (OHC) (Levitus et al., 2005, 2012; Trenberth et al., 2014;

Cheng et al., 2017). Recent OHC estimation by Cheng et al. (2017) showed that all ocean

basins experienced significant warming since 1998.

One of the most important natural (non-anthrophogenic) forcing in the Earth’s climate

system is the volcanic one (Robock, 2000; Stenchikov et al., 2009; Stenchikov, 2016).

Earth’s climate is regulated primarily by its energy imbalance, which is the equilibrium

between incoming and outgoing radiation, energy redistribution and exchange among the

system components (Cole-Dai, 2010), such as atmosphere, ocean, land, cryosphere and

biosphere. In this sense, volcanic eruptions are important because they cause changes in

the climate by altering Earth’s energy steady state, due to changes in the energy budget,

such as modifications on the planetary albedo1 (Cole-Dai, 2010).

Quantifying how much of the climate system is impacted by natural forcing is a key

aspect for understanding the Earth’s climate, in order to evaluate the relative impacts

of human pollution and land surface modification (Gao et al., 2008) and to anticipate

future climate projections (Mignot et al., 2011; Stevenson et al., 2016). Furthermore,

evaluation of climate model outputs that include volcanic forcing helps to improve Earth

System Climate Models that are needed to study anthropogenic effects (Robock, 2000).

Chapter 1. INTRODUCTION 2

1.1 Volcanism and Climate Variability

Volcanic eruptions are important elements of natural climate variability and climate

change in different scales (Robock, 2000; Stenchikov et al., 2009; Cole-Dai, 2010) as seen

in Figure 1.1 in a schematic overview. Typically the atmosphere is composed by a mix of

permanent gases that are nitrogen and oxygen, in greater volume, and minor constituents

as carbon dioxide, water vapour and ozone which play a crucial role (Andrews, 2010).

Large volcanic eruptions inject various gases and particles into the atmosphere, which

modifies its composition (Timmreck, 2012). Volcanic ash is injected in the atmosphere

and because of its great size and density it drops out in a couple of weeks (Robock,

2000; Timmreck, 2012; Langmann, 2014). Thus, acting only in short-term and regional

to continental scale changes in the Earth’s radiative imbalance and mainly in weather

characteristics (Stenchikov, 2016). For detailed role of volcanic ash on the climate the

reader is referred to Langmann (2014).

Figure 1.1: Schematic overview of the climate effects after a large eruption |
Impact is exemplified on stratosphere, troposphere, ocean, marine biogeochemistry and
vegetation (fromTimmreck, 2012).

In addition, there is emission of two important GHG - water vapor and carbon dioxide,

which are negligible in comparison to their atmospheric concentration (Robock, 2000).



3 1.1. Volcanism and Climate Variability

Effects on atmospheric carbon concentration due to volcanism are small, as well as its

feedbacks (Meronen et al., 2012). According to Gerlach (2011) the anthropogenic CO2

emission dominate over all kind of volcanic emissions (e.g., degassing, submarine volcanoes

and explosions), authors even suggest that the present day annual anthropogenic emissions

may exceed the output of at least one super eruption. The same occurs for N2 emissions

(Stenchikov, 2016). In addition, there is an input of halogen compounds, such as HCl

and Br substances, which could react with the ozone layer increasing ozone depletion

(Timmreck, 2012; Stenchikov, 2016).

In global scale climate effect, emission of sulfur-containing gases is the most relevant.

Strong enough eruptions are capable of insert gases such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and

hydrogen sulfide (H2S) into the stratosphere (Robock, 2000; Cole-Dai, 2010; Timmreck,

2012). As depicted in Figure 1.1, these gases are oxidized, reacting with OH and H2O, to

sulfuric acid vapor (H2SO4?) on timescale of weeks (Robock, 2000). Then, it is converted

to sulfate aerosols that produce the dominant radiative effect from volcanism, which is the

focus of the present study (Timmreck, 2012). After injected into the stratosphere sulfate

aerosols are able to be advected around the globe very rapidly, driven by atmospheric

circulation (Robock, 2000).

The sulfate aerosol cloud has an e-folding decay time of ?1 year, during this period

it impacts on both short-wave and long-wave radiation (Robock, 2000). According to

Stenchikov (2016), the total forcing related to volcanic eruptions results from a compen-

sation mechanism between the long-wave and short-wave radiation. At the same time

that there is an increase in short-wave reflection (between 3 to 5 W m?2), there is aerosol

absorption of long-wave radiation, so the total cooling of the system is between 2 to 3

W m?2. As exemplified in Figure 1.2 of volcanic aerosol total, short-wave and long-wave

radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere during some of the great modern eruptions,

such as Agung (1963), El Chichón (1982) and Mt. Pinatubo (1991).

(red line) and long-wave (blue line) radiative forcing [W m?2] at the top of the atmosphere
from 1950 to 2000 (from Stenchikov, 2016).

The information about magnitude and approximate location of past eruptions is

obtained from paleovolcanic ice-core records, mainly sulfate aerosol deposits in Arctic and

Antarctica (Cole-Dai, 2010; Timmreck, 2012; Stevenson et al., 2016). This information

helps create reconstructions of eruption strength such as Gao et al. (2008) and Crowley

et al. (2008). However, Sigl et al. (2014) points out that reconstructions may overestimate

or underestimate volcanic aerosol before 1500, which leads to simulations of stronger

cooling from what is found in temperature reconstructions. Also, there are other ways to

have evidence of past volcanic eruptions climate responses, for example from tree-rings

and other proxy archives (Sigl et al., 2015; Stevenson et al., 2016). Different from ice-core

records, the tree-rings measurements are an indirect way of obtaining volcanism evidence,

since what is imprinted in the tree-rings is the temperature change and not the direct

amount of sulfate aerosol in the atmosphere (Cole-Dai, 2010).

A common index used to compare the eruption magnitude is the Volcanic Explosivity

Index (VEI), which is used as a measurement of the climatological impact of volcanoes

(Robock, 2000). The greatest volcanic eruptions in history have a VEI of 8, but the scale

is open-ended (Newhall and Self, 1982).

Because of the sulfate aerosols ability to spread in both hemispheres, tropical eruptions



5 1.1. Volcanism and Climate Variability

are the most important relative to global climate (Schneider et al., 2009). High latitude

volcanoes primarily affect the hemisphere in which they are located (Timmreck, 2012;

Meronen et al., 2012). The season of eruption is also an important factor, since the

distribution of the sulfate aerosol cloud is mainly controlled by large-scale circulation of

the atmosphere (Timmreck, 2012). As described in Meronen et al. (2012) winter eruptions

cause smaller climate effects than summer and early autumn eruptions. Stevenson et al.

(2017) suggest that the eruption season could help explain the differences between proxy

data and models.

The effect of volcanism on the atmosphere can last for about five to seven years and

even more in the oceans (Stenchikov, 2016). Examples of the impact of volcanism on the

atmosphere and ocean are shown in Sections 1.1.1 and 1.1.2, respectively.

1.1.1 Volcanism impact on the atmosphere

The sulfate aerosol acts like a shield from incoming solar radiation on the top of the

troposphere. By scattering short-waves atmosphere albedo is increased (Cole-Dai, 2010),

thereby causing primarily surface cooling (Robock, 2000; Timmreck, 2012; Stenchikov,

2016). Aerosols also absorb long-wave and near-infrared radiation (Stenchikov, 2016),

producing strong stratospheric warming (Figure 1.1). In the lower latitudes Robock and

Mao (1992) observed cooling due to reduced solar flux, the maximum surface atmospheric

temperature anomaly is of -0.172K during July (Meronen et al., 2012). At the same time,

there is winter warming over northern hemisphere continents, which is connected with

changes in the atmosphere dynamics processes (Robock and Mao, 1992; Robock, 2000;

Robock et al., 2007; Graf et al., 2007). Surface atmosphere temperature changes over

the oceans are smaller than over the continents, related with the larger heat capacity of

water (Meronen et al., 2012).

While the northern hemisphere atmospheric variability related to volcanic activity is

well known, eruptions consequences on the southern hemisphere still in debate (Timmreck,

2012). For example, studies diverge about the effect for the Southern Annular Mode



Chapter 1. INTRODUCTION 6

(SAM)2 (e.g., Roscoe and Haigh, 2007; Robock et al., 2007; McGraw et al., 2016). Results

from Roscoe and Haigh (2007) showed a negative correlation between volcanic aerosol

and SAM. Schneider et al. (2009) observed the westerlies shift equatorward in a high-

latitude eruption scenario in the CCSM3. Results from Karpechko et al. (2010) also

showed westerlies intensification after eruptions, which is in agreement with positive

SAM. On the other hand, Robock et al. (2007) does not observe any significant change in

the SAM intensity. Using Large Ensemble experiment from CESM and Coupled Model

Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), McGraw et al. (2016) also show results that

the southern hemisphere response to eruptions is a robust positive SAM, however with

large internal variability3. The authors discuss that El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)

influences the SAM response to volcanism, in which the SAM anomaly is larger during

negative ENSO conditions.

There is a relation between volcanic eruptions and ENSO events (Lehner et al., 2016;

Pausata et al., 2016). Timmreck (2012) with climate models and Li et al. (2013) with

proxy evidence proposed that volcanism could force the climate system a favorable state to

ENSO occurrence in the year after an eruption. As well, Pausata et al. (2015) showed with

climate model that high-latitude eruptions in the northern hemisphere could induce ENSO

occurrence in the 8-9 months. Stevenson et al. (2016) also observed using an ensemble

approach that northern eruptions tends toward El Niño, while southern eruptions tends

toward La Niña. Maher et al. (2015) observed with 610 ensemble set from CMIP5, the

same increased likelihood of an El Niño-like response after an eruption and also suggest

that there is an increased chance of La Niña occurrence in the third austral summer

(defined as the December, January and February average, DJF) after the eruption.

Also the hydrological cycle is globally affected by great volcanic activity (Barnes

et al., 2016; Fasullo et al., 2017). Significant reduction in global mean precipitation

following volcanic eruptions is shown in Trenberth and Dai (2007), Schneider et al. (2009)

and Meronen et al. (2012). However, the response is not always linear because of cloud

microphysics, great variability and different atmosphere time scales (Timmreck, 2012). In

addition, Joseph and Zeng (2011) found evidence that the precipitation response over the

land is faster than over the oceans, related to their difference heat capacities. Stevenson

et al. (2016) discuss that volcanic eruptions influence the monsoon system as well.

1.1.2 Volcanism impact on the ocean

Ocean properties and its dynamics are affected by volcanic eruptions as well, however

its response could reach even longer time scales than the atmospheric disturbance.

Ocean temperature

As with the atmosphere temperature, surface ocean cools after volcanic events (e.g.,

Church et al., 2005; Ding et al., 2014; McGregor et al., 2015; Stenchikov, 2016). According

to Church et al. (2005) the automatic reduction in the net solar flux after an eruption

is the first trigger for SST changes. Evan et al. (2009) show that about 67% of the low

frequency SST variability is driven by aerosol effects on the incoming radiation, in which

55% is from volcanic activity for the period of 1082-2007.

Results from Church et al. (2005) discuss a decrease in the SST of -0.4?C in the

model output and -0.3?C in observations. Evan et al. (2009) studying the Tropical North

Atlantic Ocean with models observe a cooling that ranges from -0.1 to -2?C. During the

period 850-1850 (LM), Mignot et al. (2011) observe an abrupt surface ocean cooling of

1?C. Stenchikov (2016) show a negative anomaly in the SST of 0.4-1K. For eruptions

between 1871 and 2005, Ding et al. (2014) observe a globally averaged post eruption

cooling of 0.1 to 0.3?C. In the same period, results using ORAs4 reanalysis show global

cooling episodes related to El Chichón (1982) eruption (Balmaseda et al., 2013). In

addition, there is evidence of cooling in the polar North Atlantic SST in proxy data and

model simulations detected in Sicre et al. (2011). Authors observe decadal cooling of 1

to 2?C, which agree with episodes of volcanic eruption during the LM.

Using CMIP5 results Ding et al. (2014) observe that the SST cold anomaly due to



Chapter 1. INTRODUCTION 8

volcanic eruptions is the lowest 1-2 years following eruptions. This fact is consistent

with Pausata et al. (2015) model experiments that show a cooling that develops in the

1-3 years after the eruption in the Pacific Ocean. Moreover, volcanic activity could be

responsible for the beginning of the anomalous cold period known as Little Ice Age (LIA),

between 1400-1700 (Crowley et al., 2008; Sicre et al., 2011). This agrees with Miller et al.

(2012), where they discuss that the repeated explosive volcanism at the time would be

able to create a anomalous cooling, which could be maintained by sea-ice-ocean feedback.

The cooling due to volcanic explosions could even impact the recent ocean warming.

Results from 7 ensemble simulations between 1861-2000 show that the atmosphere aerosol

input from volcanic eruptions is able to reduce in ? 2/3 the magnitude of the recent ocean

warming due to GHG (Delworth et al., 2005). This agrees with Gleckler et al. (2006)

that shows the importance of models that included volcanic forcing in understanding and

correctly estimating global climate. The author discuss the dramatic effect on simulated

changes in OHC and sea level over the 20?? century.

Church et al. (2005) observe 3×1022J decrease in OHC, while Stenchikov (2016)

observe a maximum of 5×1022J. Church et al. (2005) point that the maximum cooling

occurs between 50S and 60N, during the first and second summers for both hemispheres.

Probably due to shallow mixed layers at this time of year, which responds more rapidly

to heat flux changes (Church et al., 2005).Delworth et al. (2005) suggests that the

subsurface recovery time scales is greater than surface anomalies, because of the absence

of air-sea fluxes. Stenchikov (2016) discuss that the time necessary to ocean recover to its

unperturbed state could reach centennial scales. This agrees with Pausata et al. (2015)

results in SST on Nino3.4 region. However, Church et al. (2005) results show smaller

recovery time scales. Authors suggest that on the thermocline the signal from volcanism

would remain for decades, fact that also agrees with Ding et al. (2014).

Stenchikov et al. (2009) propose that if the surface anomalous temperature could last

at least a decade, the portion of this anomaly that is transmitted to the OHC, would last

up to 50 years. On the other side, Gregory (2010) discuss that the OHC drop after an

eruption and the long-term recovery time may not be real, but a result from an artifact



9 1.1. Volcanism and Climate Variability

of experimental design related to Ocean General Circulation Models spin up scheme.

The size of the eruption is an important consideration when analyzing its consequences

(Gleckler et al., 2006; Sigl et al., 2015; Stenchikov, 2016). In addition, the background

condition, meaning the ocean condition before the volcanic event, is also important in

evaluating the climate response, as shown in Zanchettin et al. (2013).

Due to changes in the OHC, consequently there are alterations in the mean sea level

through steric height (Gregory et al., 2006; Stenchikov, 2016). Simulations indicate a

drop of 6 to 25mm in the mean sea level after a volcanic event, that takes a decade to

recover (Church et al., 2005; Cazenave, 2005; Fasullo and Nerem, 2016). In addition,

volcanic induced perturbations propagate into the ocean deeper layers. Stenchikov (2016)

identified a cooling in the deep Southern Ocean. The signal in the deep ocean, between

0-1000m, may persist for several decades (Ding et al., 2014).

Sea-Ice

A complex consequence of volcanic eruptions is the sea-ice feedback. Based on a series

of CMIP5 ensembles Ding et al. (2014) observe sea ice extent and mass increase by about

5%. Stenchikov et al. (2009) observe in the Arctic maximum sea ice extent anomaly

of 0.6 to 0.8 × 106km2. Even though sea-ice modifications being hard to estimate in

observations and models, Stenchikov (2016) point that the sea-ice extension responds

more to ocean temperature and circulation, than to the direct change of the radiative

forcing. Fact that agrees with Zhong et al. (2011) that discuss the high sensitivity of the

sea-ice response. Zanchettin et al. (2014), using climate simulation ensembles, point to

Arctic and Antarctic asymmetry after an eruption. Authors have divided the response

in two phases, firstly the sea-ice in both poles expand followed by contraction only in

Antarctica sea-ice.

1.1.3 Modern eruption: Mt. Pinatubo

The Mt. Pinatubo is the best observed eruption so far (Timmreck, 2012), being the

largest volcanic explosion from the 20?? century (Robock, 2002) and since of the beginning

of the satellite era (Barnes et al., 2016). It erupted in June 1991 in the Philippines, Luzon

Island at 15.1N and 120.4E shown in Figure 1.3. Its explosion liberated 20 Tg of SO2

into the stratosphere (Robock and Mao, 1992) and a estimated release of 0.05 Gigatons

of CO2 in the atmosphere (Gerlach, 2011).

Figure 1.3: Mt. Pinatubo | (a) 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption (https://www.wired.
com/2016/). (b) Geographical location of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines.

Mt. Pinatubo eruption has been widely studied (e.g., Hansen et al., 1992; Stenchikov

et al., 1998; Robock et al., 2007; Otterå, 2008; Bender et al., 2010; Meehl et al., 2015;

Barnes et al., 2016; Predybaylo et al., 2017). The amount of aerosol injection is equivalent

to a radiative cooling of 0.2 ? 0.3?C (Gao et al., 2008). As major effect in the northern

hemisphere documented in Robock (2002) the surface atmosphere was cooled by about

2?C during the boreal summer of the next year and in the boreal winter of 1992-1993 it

was warmer by 3?C.

Another fact pointed in Robock (2002) is the possibility of delayed global warming in

several years because of the cooling effect related to Mt. Pinatubo explosion. Further,

aerosol from volcanic eruptions are described as one possible driver of hiatus periods

during warming scenario (Maher et al., 2014; Santer et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2016). At

the same time, Maher et al. (2014) also discuss the importance of the background condition

in the eruption, because even Mt. Pinatubo being one of the largest eruptions since 1860,

https://www.wired.com/2016/
https://www.wired.com/2016/


11 1.1. Volcanism and Climate Variability

it was not enough to increase the likelihood of hiatus period, as observed in the Krakatoa

eruption in 1883. Also, due to non-stationary background of large anthropogenically

forced changes in ocean heat content, the anomalies induced by Mt. Pinatubo eruption

are much smaller than Krakatoa (1883) temperature anomalies (Gleckler et al., 2006).

A Mt. Pinatubo sized eruption simulation creates a -0.4K SST anomaly, a decrease in

the mean sea level of 9mm, a decrease in the OHC of 5× 1022J and Atlantic Meridional

Overturning Circulation (AMOC)4 strengthening of ?1.8 Sv (Stenchikov et al., 2009;

Stenchikov, 2016). The same surface cooling after Mt. Pinatubo eruption is observed

in simulations by Church et al. (2005), however observations have shown smaller cooling

of 0.3?C and a decrease in OHC of 3× 1022J. At the same time, in CMIP5 results Ding

et al. (2014) find negative SST anomaly of only 0.1?C. Also documented as consequences

of the Mt. Pinatubo eruption are the decrease in stratospheric ozone, increase in the

stratospheric temperature (Timmreck, 2012 and references therein) and changes in the

hydrological cycle (Trenberth and Dai, 2007) .

It should be noted that Mt. Pinatubo eruption followed other two eruptions Agung

in 1963 and El Chichón in 1982. Bender et al. (2010) discuss that Mt. Pinatubo eruption

may have overlapping of anomalies due to eruptions proximity, even though that the

radiative perturbation has already decayed. In the same year of Mt. Pinatubo explosion

an ENSO event was observed, Robock et al. (2007) suggests that the 1991-1992 El Niño

event could even suppress the volcanic signal in the observational data. Bender et al.

(2010) discuss that this could help explain differences between observational and model

simulations in the volcanic signals. Although Mt. Pinatubo has been the great eruption

of the 20?? century, during August 1991, Cerro Hudson (Chile) erupted as well (Cole-Dai

et al., 1999). This eruption was smaller than the Mt. Pinatubo, however its location is

in the southern hemisphere (Cole-Dai et al., 1997). Therefore, there may be influence

of this eruption on the South Atlantic Ocean, however this volcano is not present in the

reconstruction (Gao et al., 2008) that forced CESM-LME (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016).

Chapter 1. INTRODUCTION 12

1.2 The South Atlantic Ocean

Here the main characteristics of the South Atlantic region including its Southern

Ocean sector are described, which is the focus of this work.

Surface Winds

Over the South Atlantic the wind circulation is mainly composed by a strong westerly

wind belt, on average between 40S and 60S (Talley et al., 2011). Westerlies are stronger

during the austral winter, however the variability is smaller than the subtropical zone

wind in the northern hemisphere (Tomczak and Godfrey, 2001). Further south, around

Antarctica the wind regime is dominated by the polar easterlies, which are the most

intense in the Atlantic Ocean (Tomczak and Godfrey, 2001). Over the Weddell Sea, the

wind circulation is controlled by a low pressure center (Deacon, 1979). The representation

of surface wind circulation for the LM is shown on Figure 3.2. For further details about

the wind circulation in the South Atlantic Ocean the reader is referred to Cavalcanti et al.

(2009).

Wind-driven Circulation

The dominant wind regime is responsible for the surface circulation in the South

Atlantic Ocean and its southern sector, represented in Figure 1.4. The northern limit of

the study region is 30S and extends to the Antarctic coastline. The Atlantic sector is

considered from 70W to 30E. It includes part of the southern hemisphere anticyclonic

subtropical gyre in the South Atlantic Ocean, the Antarctic Circumpolar Curent (ACC),

as well the subpolar gyre in the Weddell Sea.

The South Atlantic anticyclonic subtropical gyre is composed by the South Equatorial

Current (SEC) as its northern extension (Tomczak and Godfrey, 2001), a broad westward

flow that splits at the western boundary into the Brazil Current (BC) and North Brazil

Current (NBC). The Brazil Current is the western boundary current, that flows southward

to the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence, around 36-38S; where it meets the Malvinas Current



13 1.2. The South Atlantic Ocean

(MC), the north-eastward extension of the ACC into the Atlantic (Talley et al., 2011).

The South Atlantic Current (SAC) closes the gyre in its southern extension, it flows

eastward to the Benguela Current (BeC) and recirculates within the subtropical gyre.

The Southern Ocean region is dominated by the eastward flow of the ACC, its north

boundary is the Subtropical Front. The ACC is mostly driven by the wind circulation;

however it is not a broad eastward flow, but a composition of three main jets associated



Chapter 1. INTRODUCTION 14

with oceanic fronts (Talley et al., 2011), which are from north to south, the Subantarctic

Front, Polar Front and the South Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. The main

ACC characteristic is its circumpolar circulation, which makes it an important and only

connection between the other oceans in the globe. The Antarctic Divergence is located at

the ACC southern boundary, it exists because of the wind circulation transition between

the westerlies to easterlies (Carter et al., 2008). This region is related to upwelling of

intermediate and deep waters (e.g., North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW)).

South of the ACC is the Weddell subpolar gyre, which is separated from the ACC flow

by the Weddell Gyre Front, around 60S (Heywood et al., 2004). The Weddell Gyre extends

from approximately 60W to 20E (Cavalieri and Parkinson, 2008). Near the continent the

Weddell Gyre is formed partially by the Antarctic Coastal Current (ACoC)(Talley et al.,

2011). According to Núñez-Riboni and Fahrbach (2009), this current flows westward

over the shelf acting as a dynamic barrier to the Warm Deep Water (WDW) and it is

associated with shelf break fronts, as the Antarctic Shelf Front (Talley et al., 2011). For

more details about the Weddell Sea, the reader is referred to Hellmer et al. (2016).

Water Masses

Most of the ocean floor, about 58% (Johnson, 2008), is covered by the Antarctic

Bottom Water (AABW), which is part of the deep branch of the AMOC. Its production

is dependent on many complex ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere interaction processes in the

Southern Ocean (e.g., Kerr et al., 2017), one of the most important is the shelf break

convection5.

The AABW formation depends on different source water types, which originates local

types of bottom water that later are exported to the global circulation. Jullion et al.

(2014) discuss that the role of the Weddell Sea in producing and exporting AABW is

yet not completely understood and stems in part from the inflow from the Indian sector.

Meredith (2013) points that the Weddell Sea is one of the most important site for the
5Mixture of surface waters, near the freezing point, with intermediate waters, which are warmer and

saltier; therefore, sinking by convection near the Antarctic shelf break (Nicholls et al., 2009 and references
therein).



15 1.2. The South Atlantic Ocean

AABW formation, contributing roughly 40%. Therefore, the local water masses from the

Weddell Sea play a role on the AABW formation, such as the WDW, which is a local

variety of the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) entering the Weddell Gyre at its eastern

boundary. It is characterized by temperature and salinity within the ranges 0&amp;lt;?&amp;lt;1?C

and 34.60&amp;lt;S&amp;lt;34.75 and flows in the Weddell Gyre deep layer (Ryan et al., 2016). The

CDW is the most important water present in the ACC circulation, from 200 to almost

4000m depth (Tomczak and Godfrey, 2001). Normally, it is divided in two types: Upper

CDW, that is low in oxygen and high in nutrients, and the high salinity Lower CDW

(e.g., Kerr, 2010).

At the surface there is the Antarctic Surface Water (AASW), that responds to ice-melt

and freezing related to seasonality (Talley et al., 2011), from the surface to about 200m

depth. In the Weddell Sea region there is also the Continental Shelf Water, divided in

different waters present in the shelf region (e.g., Winter Water, High Salinity Shelf Water

and the Ice Shelf Water).

Finally, in the intermediate to deep layers of the oceanic region there is a north-

ward flow of the Subantarctic Modal Water (SAMW) and Antarctic Intermediate Wa-

ter (AAIW) (Talley et al., 2011). The SAMW is identified by its low oxygen index, placed

below the Subantarctic Surface Water, that is a thick mixed layer formed during winter

(Talley et al., 2011). Also located north of the Subantarctic Front, AAIW is characterized

by a low salinity layer present from 500 to 1500m depth (Talley et al., 2011).



Chapter 1. INTRODUCTION 16

1.3 Motivation and Scientific Hypothesis

Volcanism is widely known to have an important role in climate change and in control-

ling the Earth energy imbalance (Stenchikov et al., 2009; Cole-Dai, 2010). Understanding

how different components of the climate system respond to natural forcings is a key

aspect to access how the whole Earth system would respond to future climate change.

One important component of the Earth system is the Southern Ocean, in which there is

a lack of knowledge about the impact of the volcanic forcing.

The impact of great volcanic eruptions in the southern hemisphere is not well known

yet, even more in the South Atlantic and its Southern Ocean sector. Investigation of the

atmospheric and ocean response to volcanism has been addressed in modeling studies,

particularly for the large LM eruptions as well as for the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption,

but not for this region. The LM is one of the periods with more proxy data records

(Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016), which make it possible to evaluate results from coupled

climate system models that give a complete and longer perspective on climate variability

(Schneider et al., 2009). Moreover, quantification of volcanic induced changes in the

oceans from LM super eruptions (i.e., Mt. Samalas eruption during 1258 in Indonesia)

might help to better understand the current climate trends (Stenchikov et al., 2009). As

a comparison to the LM eruptions 1991 Mt. Pinatubo event is analyzed, because it is a

recent and significant eruption proven to have global impact (Bender et al., 2010), for

which observations and reanalysis products are available.

Therefore, the hypothesis of this study is that great volcanic eruptions will have

an impact on the South Atlantic and its Southern Ocean sector circulation during the

LM. Thus, if there is a signal from great volcanic eruptions detected in the coupled-

climate model numerical simulations, would it be possible to identify the same signal

from observations considering the much smaller eruption of 1991 Mt. Pinatubo?



17 1.4. Objectives

1.4 Objectives

Investigate the impact of Last Millennium volcanic events on the South Atlantic and

its Southern Ocean sector.

Specific objectives to verify the hypothesis outlined above:

i Quantify changes due to volcanic eruptions in air-sea properties on the South Atlantic

and its Southern Ocean sector through the Last Millennium using results from the

Last Millennium Ensemble experiment from the Community Earth System Model

developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (CESM-LME/NCAR).

ii Investigate if the observed impact of Last Millennium eruptions on the South Atlantic

Ocean is also detected from observations related to the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption.



2 MATERIAL AND METHODS

2.1 Data

Volcanically induced changes in the South Atlantic and its southern sector are exam-

ined using simulation results from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)

Last Millennium Ensemble Experiment (LME) of the Community Earth System Model

(CESM), hereafter referred to as CESM-LME (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016). The simula-

tion results are subdivided in two periods for this study: (i) 850-1850, the same period

used in Mignot et al. (2011) and Stevenson et al. (2016), with focus on the natural

external forcings. Then, (ii) 1980-2005, in contrast with the first subperiod, contains

the anthropogenic imprint. Detection and attribution of climate change in this kind of

study is possible, because the CESM-LME long runs without any anthropogenic influence

(Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016).

For the results validation the Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature Ver-

sion 5 (ERSSTv5) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),

details described in Huang et al. (2017), and the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA)

reanalysis version 3.4.1 (Carton and Giese, 2008) are used as auxiliary data. The auxiliary

data is used in comparison with the CESM-LME post industrial period, specifically with

the modern eruption of Mt. Pinatubo from June 1991. More details concerning each

data set mentioned above and the analysis used are provided in the following sections.

2.1.1 Community Earth System Model - Last Millennium

Ensemble

The LME simulations use the CESM version 1.1 with the Community Atmosphere

Model version 5 (CAM5), see Hurrell et al. (2013) and Kay et al. (2015). The spatial



19 2.1. Data

resolution of the atmosphere and land components is ?2?. The ocean and sea-ice com-

ponents use ?1? spatial resolution and 60 layers as ocean vertical resolution, from the

surface (15m) to 145m the vertical resolution is 10m. The vertical resolution starts to

increase in greater depths, from approximately 880m the vertical resolution is of 100m,

increasing to a maximum of 244m in greater depths around 3000m.

The model has been spun up from an 1850 control simulation of 650 year and for an

850 control simulation as well, therefore all simulations were started from year 850 of

the control simulation (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016). CESM-LME is composed by 10 full

forcing runs, in which all forcings evolve from 850 to 2005. Also, 6 ensembles of single

forcing runs considering the evolution of each forcing individually with all other fixed at

values from the year 850 (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016). The single forcing members are 4

solar only, 5 volcanic only, 3 land use only, 3 GHG only, 3 orbital only and 2 ozone-aerosol

only (Figure 2.1). The forcings and implementation are the same as used in Landrum

et al. (2013).

Figure 2.1: Runs from CESM-LME | Lengths of the control (black lines) and forced
runs from the CESM-LME, which are 10 full forcings, 5 volcanic onty, 4 solar only, 3
GHG, 3 land use only, 3 orbital only and 2 ozone-aerosol only (from Otto-Bliesner et al.,
2016).

As described in Otto-Bliesner et al. (2016), the only difference between ensemble

members is a small perturbation of order 10?4 ?C in the air temperature initial condi-

tions. The ensemble approach allows improved estimate of the uncertainty from internal

variability and modeling process (Randall et al., 2007).



Chapter 2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 20

The forcings considered for the period from 850 to 1850 were GHG (e.g., CO2, CH4

and N2O) based on Schmidt et al. (2011); orbital changes from Berger (1978); changes

in the total solar irradiance prescribed using Vieira et al. (2011); land use derived from

a merge between Pongratz et al. (2008) and Hurtt et al. (2011); finally, the volcanic

eruptions from the reconstruction version 1 from Gao et al. (2008). What changed for

the period from 1850 to 2005 was the inclusion of ozone and aerosol forcings (e.g., GHG)

evolving through time (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016).

The volcanic eruptions are one of the most important forcings from the LM (Colose

et al., 2016), thus it is the focus of the present study. For the volcanic eruptions recon-

struction Gao et al. (2008) use a total of 53 ice cores, 32 from the Arctic and 22 from

Antarctica, composing a comprehensive stratospheric volcanic sulfate mass loading for the

past 1500 years. This can be converted to optical perturbation index and/or to radiative

forcing series. Aerosol concentration varies as function of time, responding to seasonal

variations in stratospheric circulation, latitude and altitude. Eruptions without recorded

seasonality have been assumed to occur in April, which introduce a 10% uncertainty,

mostly in high-latitude sulfate deposition (Gao et al., 2008).

Figure 2.2: Volcanic mass evolution | Period between 850 and 2005 used in the CESM-
LME. Three of the greatest explosions from the LM are marked: Samalas (1258), Kuwae
(1452) and 1815 Tambora. Volcanic mass is in Tg (from Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016).

Two LM periods were marked by great and frequent volcanic activity: the last half of

the thirteenth century and the first half of the nineteenth century (Otto-Bliesner et al.,

2016). Gao et al. (2008) state that the cumulative amount of volcanic sulfate flux was 2

to 10 times larger during the thirteenth century than any other century within the LM.

In terms of estimated total global stratospheric volcanic sulfate aerosol injection, as seen

in Figure 2.2, the largest eruptions were the Salamas in Indonesia during 1258 (257.9



21 2.1. Data

Tg), followed by Kuwae of Vanuatu in 1452 (137.5 Tg) and in 1815 Tambora located in

Indonesia estimated at 109.7 Tg (Gao et al., 2008; Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016).

2.1.2 Auxiliary Data

ERSSTv5

As an auxiliary data for CESM-LME validation, monthly means of SST from the

NOAA ERSSTv5 data set are used (Huang et al., 2017). This data set is derived from

the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADs) and spatial

completeness enhanced with statistical methods. The product has a spatial resolution

of 2? and cover January 1854 up to 2015. The data set is available on&amp;lt;https://data.

nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00927&gt;. For the present study the

period between 1980 and 2005 is used, with focus on the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption.

SODA 3.4.1

The SODA version 3.4.1 is an estimate of the evolving state of the ocean (Carton

and Giese, 2008). SODA uses an ocean general circulation model (GFDL MOM5/SIS)

to assimilate available in situ temperature and salinity profiles, also data from satellite.

The product is a gridded data set of monthly values from 1980 to 2015, at 0.5? horizontal

resolution and 40 vertical levels (Carton and Giese, 2008).

According to Carton et al. (2018), the version 3.4.1 of SODA includes an active sea

ice component and is forced by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts

(ECMWF) ERA-Interim (Dee and Uppala, 2008). For more details and a complete

overview of the SODA reanalysis methodology, the reader is referred to Carton and

Giese (2008). The data set is available online at&amp;lt;http://www.atmos.umd.edu/~ocean/

index_files/soda3.4.1_mn_download.htm&gt;. As ERSSTv5, here the period between

1980 and 2005 is used, with focus on the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo explosion.

2.2 Analysis

Analysis has been divided in periods: in the Subsection 2.2.1 the LM eruptions from

850 to 1850, that uses CESM-LME simulation results. Described in Subsection 2.2.2

the 1991 modern eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, that includes also a comparison with the

auxiliary data sets.

2.2.1 Last Millennium eruptions analysis

Considering the average of 15 ensemble members, 10 full forcing and 5 volcanic only,

the analysis has been restricted to the period 850-1850, to exclude any CO2-induced

trends in the full forcing runs. The ensemble average is used as in Goosse et al. (2005)

to reduce the internal variability. All anomalies presented in the LM eruptions analysis

are calculated relative to the 850-1850 mean.

Eruptions are divided into three classes according to Stevenson et al. (2016) and

Gao et al. (2008). First, the authors only selected eruptions with a peak aerosol mass

mixing ratio greater than 10?8. Then, the aerosol mass mixing ratio is integrated during

the eruption year and two subsequent years over the northern and southern hemisphere.

Lastly the ratio between them is calculated to distinguish the eruption source (Stevenson

et al., 2016). From this, as described in Stevenson et al. (2016), eruptions have been

classified as Northern, Southern and Tropical. In this study, analysis has been restricted

to Tropical and Southern eruptions as shown in Table 2.1.

Table 2.1: Years of eruptions | Eruptions are divided in Tropical and Southern regions
(from Stevenson et al., 2016).

Region Years

Tropical 1258 (Samalas), 1284, 1809, 1815 (Tambora)

Southern 1275, 1341, 1452 (Kuwae)

For the composite analysis only the austral summer (DJF) is considered, because it

is the season with less sea-ice extension in the Weddell Sea, also follows results from



23 2.2. Analysis

Stevenson et al. (2016). Church et al. (2005) results show that the maximum response

to volcanic activity is in the summer, for both hemispheres, which is probably result

of shallow mixed layers, thus simplifying heat flux change. The year of the eruption is

referred as Yr 0 in the composite maps, which averaged all 7 eruption in Table 2.1 for the

15 ensemble members, therefore 105 events in total. The composite evolution starts in

the year before the eruption (Yr -1) and includes the 6 subsequent years (Yr +1 to +6).

The difference maps between composite years are all subtracted from the year before the

eruption (Yr -1), as a reference to quantify the changes due to volcanism.

All the significance levels presented are determined according to the Wilcoxon Rank-

Sum (WRS) test as in Stevenson et al. (2016). The set of the composite years (all the 105

events) are compared with the full time series from all ensemble members. This is the

nonparametric version of the t-test since it only makes the assumption of independence

between the time series and equal variance, but not that the data has a known distribution.

The reader is referred to Gibbons and Chakraborti (2003) for detailed information about

the WRS test.

To assess the evolution of the changes induced by volcanic eruptions, a superposed

epoch analysis (SEA) is used. This is a common analysis tool to observe the average

changes through a series of composites of multiple events as in Bothe et al. (2015); Sigl

et al. (2015) and Lehner et al. (2016). It is a statistical method, that utilizes basically

arithmetic calculations to resolve significant signal to noise problems. The SEA involves

composing data into "key-date" and then comparing means of the composite years, in

which a common response to a forcing event should emerge in the composite average

(Brad Adams et al., 2003, Supplementary Material).

Analysis is divided in three subsections considering ocean depth and water mass

characteristics as follows: (i) Surface, (ii) Vertical and (iii) Water Masses.

Surface

To verify the first impact of multiple volcanic eruptions on the South Atlantic Ocean

SST, sea surface salinity (SSS), wind stress components, zonal wind stress (TAUX) and



Chapter 2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 24

meridional wind stress (TAUY) and velocity components at the surface, zonal veloc-

ity (UVEL) and meridional velocity (VVEL) are analyzed. Zonal averages, anomaly

composite maps and its significance (i.e., WRS test), application of SEA and evaluation

of specific events during the LM are used.

Vertical

Potential temperature and salinity behavior are examined relative to ocean depth.

Changes in specific latitudinal sections such as Greenwich Meridian (0W) and Antarc-

tic Peninsula (54W) are quantified. Moreover, a vertical Hovmöller is computed (e.g.,

Gleckler et al., 2006) to understand the propagation in depth of the volcanic induced

signals.

Finally, for the Weddell Sea the volcanic perturbation is quantified at the location of

the historical SR4 WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) transect, this section

captures the inflow and outflow of Weddell circulation.

Water Masses

TS analysis (characteristic of water mass) is used, as an approach to verify if there

is any signal from multiple eruptions in the water masses structure. The diagram is

restricted to the Weddell Sea average, comparing each composite year with the LM

climatological mean.

2.2.2 Modern Eruption Analysis: Mt. Pinatubo

To validate changes observed in the multiple eruption composite from the LM, the

1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption is examined. For this analysis the study area is restricted

to 70W-30E and south of 50S, from 1990 to 1997. All anomalies presented for the

modern eruption are calculated relative to 1980-2005 climatological mean. In addition,

the anomaly time series is de-trended, as a way to minimize recent trends influence in

the results.



3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Results and discussion are divided in three main sections. The characterization

of the LM surface properties such as SST, SSS, TAUX and TAUY, profiles of potential

temperature and salinity, and a brief analysis of the CESM-LME time series are described

in Section 3.1. The LM eruptions composite results are shown in Section 3.2. The last

Section 3.3 is a comparison of LM results by putting the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in

context, which is directly related to the second specific objective (ii).

3.1 General aspects of the Last Millennium

This section is an introduction to the LM mean climatology, which is used as com-

parison to the perturbations due to LM great volcanic eruptions. It is subdivided in

Mean Surface Climatology (Subsection 3.1.1), which also includes seasonal analysis and

differences between the LM and the Present Day (PD) (1980-2005). The vertical mean

state is shown in Subsection 3.1.2. Followed by a brief time series and ensemble spread

analysis (Subsection 3.1.3).

3.1.1 Mean Surface Climatology

A comparison between the LM (850-1850) and the PD (1980-2005) periods is shown

in Figures 3.1 and 3.2 for SST, SSS, TAUX and TAUY. Despite some changes in the

magnitude, the spatial pattern in both periods is the same (Figures 3.1a,c and 3.2a), thus

it is only shown the LM climatological mean (left-hand column) and the difference between

PD and LM (right-hand column). As depicted in Figure 3.1b, SST mean climatology is

significantly (at 90% level) increased 0.3?C in the PD than in the LM.



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 26

Figure 3.1: Sea surface climatological means | LM (850-1850) (a) SST [?C] and (c)
SSS climatological means. Difference between the LM and PD (1980-2005) climatological
means for (b) SST [?C] and (d) SSS. Significance levels are determined according to a
t-test, and values that are insignificant at 90% are marked with crosses.

The same is shown for the SSS field, which presents regional positive and negative

differences (Figure 3.1d). The Drake Passage has been significantly saltier (at 90% level)

during the LM, at the same time that the northern Antarctic Peninsula and the South

America have been fresher. The ACC region is the freshest region on the domain in

contrast to further northern regions (Figure 3.1c).

Wind stress is the surface field that has changed the most from the LM to the PD.

Figure 3.2b shows a clear intensification of the westerlies of about 0.01N m?2.

climatological mean and (b) difference between the LM and PD (1980-2005) climatological
means. The wind stress magnitude is represented in the background and the vectors
represent the direction.

A quick comparison with reanalysis data (SODA) is done (figures not shown) for

the common period of 1980-2005. Results point that the South Atlantic Ocean average

in both data sets is in agreement. For the SST the field the average is of 10.32?C and

10.11?C for CESM-LME and SODA, respectively. The SSS averaged field is respectively

34.25 and 34.64, while for TAUX the average is of 0.049N m?2 and TAUY of 0.0018N

m?2 in CESM-LME compared to TAUX 0.042N m?2 and 0.0033N m?2 TAUY for SODA.

In addition, CESM-LME has been validated by Fasullo et al. (2017), reproducing key

features after Mt. Pinatubo eruption compared to reanalysis.

Seasonal Climatology

Results in the next sections are shown only for the austral summer (DJF) and with

the focus on the LM. However, a brief seasonal description is conducted in the surface

fields. Figures 3.3 and 3.4 show the mean climatology for the austral summer (DJF,

left-hand column) and winter (JJA, right-hand column).

SST and SSS seasonal fields (Figure 3.3) contain the -1.4?C isotherm, which is the sea

water freezing point representing the sea-ice extension in the CESM-LME(Otto-Bliesner

et al., 2016). The sea-ice extension is an important feature to be noticed, since our

analysis includes the Weddell Sea region, that is highly susceptible to sea-ice seasonal



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 28

variability.

Surface salinity field (Figure 3.3c,d), as the SST, also shows meaningful seasonal

differences. The ACC region (45-60S) is fresher during the austral winter (JJA, Figure

3.3d) and the Weddell Sea is saltier during the austral summer (DJF, Figure 3.3d).

Figure 3.3: Seasonal climatological means | LM climatological mean for the SST [?C]
field in the (a) austral summer (DJF) and (b) austral winter (JJA). The same for the
SSS field (c) austral summer (DJF) and (d) austral winter (JJA). Black continuous line
represent the -1.4?C isotherm.

A more intense wind stress is seen during austral winter (JJA) in Figure 3.4f. With the

meridional component (Figure 3.4c,d) the dominant component of the wind circulation

over the Weddell Sea, mainly near the Antarctic Peninsula. The wind circulation over

the Weddell Sea is a cyclonic gyre and much less intense than the westerlies belt, but is

well represented.

3.1.2 Vertical Sections

Zonally averaged sections of the South Atlantic Ocean are shown in Figure 3.5 during

the LM austral summer (DJF) between 30S and 70S, from the near surface to 3000m.

Potential temperature and salinity sections help verify how the main water masses in the

region are represented on average during this period.

Figure 3.5: South Atlantic climatological zonal sections | (a) potential temperature
[?C], the black line represent the 0?C isotherm and (b) salinity, both for the austral
summer (DJF).

The potential temperature section show the expected gradient of warmer waters at

the surface and north of 45S, accompanied by colder waters in the deeper layers and in

the southernmost region (Figure 3.5a). Temperatures below 0?C are located south of

55S, related to Antarctic Surface Waters (Talley et al., 2011). Figure 3.5b depicts the

salinity minimum, of 33.5, at the surface south of 45S that spreads north representing

the AAIW. The saltier water in the deeper layers represents the NADW, as compared

to A12 WOCE section (Boyer et al., 2013).

To verify how CESM-LME represents the Weddell Sea water masses during the LM,

the typical SR4 WOCE transect (Figure 3.6a) for the potential temperature (Figure 3.6b),

salinity (Figure 3.7a) and VVEL (Figure 3.7b) are presented from the surface to 1800m

depth.

Figure 3.6: WOCE SR4 transect | (a) Bathymetry map for the Weddell Sea and
South Atlantic Ocean showing the location of WOCE SR4 transect in black. (b) Figure
reproduced from Robertson et al. (2002) of the typical potential temperature section
along WOCE SR4 transect. From east to west, the warm core of WDW in the inflow
and outflow regions are denoted as core. (c) Climatological LM mean of the potential
temperature [?C] for the WOCE SR4 section during the austral summer (DJF). The
inflow and outflow regions are marked, respectively 71.5S,11W and 63.5S,53W.

Potential temperature shows a defined warmer core of 1.5?C from 200 to 1000m (3.6c),

which is consistent with the representation of the WDW in Figure 3.6b (Robertson et al.,

2002), it also agrees with Jullion et al. (2014) (the reader is referred to Figure 2 in Jullion

et al., 2014). In addition, the warmer core of the WDW is on averaged around 500m

(e.g., Meredith et al., 2008; Kerr et al., 2009), which matches with Figure 3.6c. See that

Figure 3.6c is mirrored from what is shown in Figure 3.6b and its section is deeper. The

waters below 0?C are at the surface above 200m, representing the Continental Shelf Water

(Talley et al., 2011) and the Winter Water in the eastern region (Jullion et al., 2014).

Figure 3.7a represents the salinity that also depicts a core below 400m of saltier



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 32

water (34.65 to 34.9), which is the WDW representation (Kerr et al., 2009; Jullion et al.,

2014). Maximum salinity core is on average located around 800m (Meredith et al., 2008),

agreeing with Figure 3.7a. At the surface the salinity is smaller, ranging from 34.3 to 34,

approximately.

Figure 3.7: WOCE SR4 transect | LM climatological mean for (a) salinity and (b)
meridional velocity [cm s?1] for the austral summer (DJF). The inflow and outflow regions
are marked, respectively 71.5S,11W and 63.5S,53W.

The meridional velocity (Figure 3.7b) corresponds to the Weddell Gyre circulation

(e.g., Nicholls et al., 2009). At the subsurface the inflow region is evident in the east

Weddell Sea edge (71.5S,11W), where the VVEL reaches ? 1cm s?1; and an outflow of

2.5cm s?1 in the western region (63.5S,53W).

3.1.3 Time Series

Here the time series for the surface properties of the 15 ensemble members average

and the ensemble spread1 are analyzed to quantify uncertainties and verify the volcanic

signal presence (Figures 3.8 to 3.10). All time series shown are the surface average for the

South Atlantic Ocean (70W-30E, south of 30S), for yearly anomalies calculated relative

to the 850-2005 climatological mean. All figures show the mean standard deviation of the

ensemble members (dotted line), according to Goosse et al. (2005) this gives an indication

of the variability related to the ensemble set. Moreover, using it as a reference provides

a measure of the robustness of the system response to the volcanic forcing.

The SST anomaly time series varies on average between -0.1 and 0.2?C during the LM

and centennial features are well represented in Figure 3.8 (Crowley et al., 2008; Mann

et al., 2009). Temperature shifts such as the warmer Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA),

on average shows positive anomalies of 0.1?C from 950 to 1250, denoted in red. During

the LIA (1400-1700) the SST anomaly is on average negative (in blue). Both periods

limits are determined following Mann et al. (2009). The recent period 1980-2005, in green,

shows evident warming trend of SST reaching anomalies of 0.4?C.

Figure 3.8: SST [?C] anomaly time series | Annual ensemble average and spread for
850-2005 period. The dotted line is the ±1 standard deviation representing the internal
variability. The black triangles represent the selected volcanic eruptions. Colors represent
different periods that are described in the legend.

1The spread of the ensemble members is the standard deviation of the averaged members, which is
calculated for each month of the time series.



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 34

All selected years of volcanic events are marked in triangles in the x-axis in Figure 3.8.

The more striking signal in the SST time series is that all volcanic events are related to

an abrupt cooling (Figure 3.8). The cooling signal is expected after an eruption due to

the radiative effect (e.g. Church et al., 2005; Stenchikov et al., 2009; Mignot et al., 2011;

Kim and Kim, 2012; Ding et al., 2014; Stenchikov, 2016). The volcanic signal in the SST

is very well represented, accounting for a small spread between the ensemble members.

Also, all volcanic events show a negative anomaly greater than the internal variability,

represented by the dotted line in Figure 3.8 by one standard deviation.

The largest South Atlantic Ocean average response is to the 1258 Samalas eruption,

a cooling of 0.5?C. This is one of the largest eruption during the LM, observations from

proxy data show that the greatest surface cooling in this period is after the Samalas

eruption (Sicre et al., 2011). A cooling of 1?C is observed in the whole Atlantic Ocean

SST in Mignot et al. (2011), the largest magnitude in the signal is probably because of

the different averaged areas. The SSS ensemble spread is shown in Figure 3.9. There are

no differences between the LM periods as in the SST.

2005 period. The dotted line is the ±1 standard deviation representing the internal
variability. The black triangles represent the selected volcanic eruptions. Colors represent
different periods that are described in the legend.

However, the response due to some of the eruptions is evident. For the largest

eruptions, such as Samalas (1258) and Kuwae (1452), the South Atlantic Ocean salinity

presents an abrupt positive anomaly (?0.04) that is larger than the range of internal

variability (dotted line in Figure 3.9). Other studies in regions such as the middle,



35 3.1. General aspects of the Last Millennium

northern high latitudes and in the Southern Ocean, have also shown an increase at the

sea surface salinity after eruptions (e.g., Stenchikov et al., 2009; Kim and Kim, 2012; Ding

et al., 2014; Pausata et al., 2015), fact that is consistent with a reduction of precipitation

found in Trenberth and Dai (2007).

Using a fully coupled model Mignot et al. (2011) observed anomalous negative salinity

after eruptions in the northern subtropics, which is consequence of increased surface

freshwater fluxes (i.e., precipitation and river runoff) in the same region. The difference

in the results may be related to specific regional characteristics, given the greater presence

of continents in the northern subtropics compared to the southern subtropics and higher

south latitudes. The TAUX and TAUY time series are represented in Figure 3.11, in

which the centennial changes are not evident during the LM. Because there is a difference

of approximately one order in the magnitude between each component of the wind stress

(TAUX &gt; TAUY) the anomaly scale for each figures is different.

different periods that are described in the legend.



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 36

The zonal wind stress response to volcanic eruptions is not clear (Figure 3.10a,b).

The wind stress change is evaluated in detail in Section 3.2.1. Even though there is a

large ensemble spread, in the PD the wind stress presents a positive trend (green line in

Figure 3.10a), TAUX increases from the late 1950, which agrees with the positive trend

in the SAM (Marshall, 2003; Thompson et al., 2011; Abram et al., 2014). In the same

period TAUY decreases on average (Figure 3.10b).

3.2 Last Millennium eruptions

This section presents the composite results considering all seven eruptions from Table

2.1 only for the austral summer (DJF). Results are divided in Subsection 3.2.1 that shows

analysis for the surface air-sea properties, including anomaly maps and LM individual

events evaluation as well. Subsection 3.2.2 discusses the results related to the vertical

properties such as potential temperature and salinity. A brief analysis of water masses

changes due to volcanism is presented in Subsection 3.2.3. Finally, results focused on the

Weddell Sea are described in Subsection 3.2.4.

3.2.1 Surface Analysis

Zonal Average

The composite zonal average is the first approach to observe how the air-sea properties

are responding to the volcanic eruptions. It averages the whole South Atlantic Ocean

defined in the study area (Section 1.2) from 30S to 70S. The continuous black line in

Figures 3.11 and 3.12 represents the internal variability limit2. In the SST zonal average

shown in Figure 3.11a all anomalies are negative, but there is meaningful zonal difference

in the averaged volcanic response. Yr +1 (red asterisks) displays the largest response

to volcanism, fact that agrees with other studies accounting for the different averaged

regions (Stenchikov et al., 2009; Balmaseda et al., 2013; Ding et al., 2014).
2Calculated as ±1 standard deviation based on the averaged ensemble members spread.



37 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions

Kim and Kim (2012) simulation results depict the largest cooling in the second year

after the eruption (Yr +2). Contrary to Mignot et al. (2011) for the North Atlantic Ocean

and Church et al. (2005) in the global average, that have observed a faster response, with

surface temperatures decrease in the year of the eruption (Yr 0). This is also not observed

in the South Atlantic given that during the year of the eruption (Yr 0 in blue squares)

the anomaly is almost zero. Nonetheless, Mignot et al. (2011) discuss that the poleward

cooling extension is stronger on the first year following the eruption, at least in the

northern hemisphere, fact that agrees with results presented here.

Figure 3.11: South Atlantic zonal average | (a) SST anomaly [?C] and (b) SSS. Each
line represents a composite year that is described in the legend. The black vertical line
is the ±1 standard deviation representing the internal variability.

SST at Yr +1 shows a cold anomaly peak of -0.6?C, that is in the range of Stenchikov

et al. (2009) simulation results between 1 and 0.4K. Fact that also agrees with Kim and

Kim (2012) that have observed a cooling in their model results from 0.25 to 0.8?C, the

higher limit is for LM eruptions. The same magnitude of a negative anomaly is present

in two different regions, 30S and ?55S (Figure 3.11a). Balmaseda et al. (2013) observed

with ORAs4 reanalysis for the Pacific Ocean that the greatest signal after eruptions is



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 38

around 30N.

The negative anomaly in temperature around 65S (i.e., Figure 3.11) recovers to the

the background condition of Yr -1 (black diamonds) in the second year after the eruption

(Yr +2, magenta crosses). At the same time that the northernmost (? 30S) negative

anomaly develops in 1-3 years. Pausata et al. (2015) have also observed a cooling that

develops in 1-3 years after the eruption for the Pacific Ocean. Stenchikov et al. (2009)

show the same for the northern hemisphere, authors discuss that this evolution happens

until volcanic aerosols vanish from the atmosphere. In the CMIP5 models the evolution

of the cooling due to volcanism is faster, the cooling is the lowest 1-2 years following

eruptions (Ding et al., 2014). However, Ding et al. (2014) mention a longer relaxation

time of SST back to its pre-eruption value of 5 to 7 years, which is close to what observed

in this study. The difference in the recovery time in each latitude suggests that the

perturbation due to volcanic eruptions in polar regions (south of 50S) may recover faster

than in the subtropical regions (north of 50S).

On the other hand, changes in the SSS (Figure 3.11b) are not as evident as the SST

ones. The Yr +1 and +2 (red asterisks and magenta crosses, respectively) depict the

same response to the volcanic event, mainly in the region between 40-50S with positive

anomalies reaching 0.06. Stenchikov et al. (2009) have also observed in simulations an

increase in salinity in the middle northern latitudes, which is consistent with reduction

of precipitation (Trenberth and Dai, 2007). Using results from CMIP5, Ding et al. (2014)

have observed increased sea surface salinity after the 1871-2005 eruptions. Anomalies

come back to the background Yr -1 (black diamonds) and also get smaller than the internal

variability, immediately at Yr +3 (green triangles). This is different from what is seen

in the SST behavior, that is out of the internal variability range, in the northernmost

domain, even in Yr +6.



39 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions

During the first year after the eruption (Yr +1), a negative anomaly of -0.04 around

55S is also observed. This agrees with negative anomaly in the northern subtropics during

the year following the eruption shown in Mignot et al. (2011). The authors attribute this

anomaly to greater freshwater fluxes due to eruptions. In addition, Kim and Kim (2012)

discuss the contribution of modified ocean convection related to changes in the SST, in

the contrasting zonal salinity anomalies. The Southern Ocean is a region of positive SSS

anomaly after eruptions (Kim and Kim, 2012), which is also observed in Figure 3.11b. A

positive anomaly of 0.04 in 60S during Yr +1 that extends into Yr +2 spreads poleward

reaching values of 0.06 in its southernmost extension.

Both, zonal (TAUX) and meridional (TAUY) wind stress responses to the volcanic

event are very well defined in the first year after the eruption (Yr +1, red asterisks in

Figure 3.12). Figures 3.12a and 3.12b, TAUX and TAUY respectively, show the largest

anomalies located in the same latitudes, however with opposing signs.

TAUY [N m?2]. Each line represents a composite year that is described in the legend.
The black vertical line is the ±1 standard deviation representing the internal variability.



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 40

During Yr +1 TAUX shows a positive anomaly of 0.025N m?2 that peaks at 60S,

while at 45S the anomaly is negative 0.02N m?2 (Figure 3.12a). Results also show that

TAUY largest anomaly happens during Yr +1, with maximum values at 45S ? 0.01N

m?2, while at 60S the anomaly is negative 0.006N m?2 (Figure 3.12b). Both, TAUX and

TAUY zonal average anomalies decrease in the subsequent years, getting closer to the

background condition of Yr -1 (black diamonds) at Yr -3 (green triangles). Although Kim

and Kim (2012) do not find any volcanic related changes in the wind circulation, present

results suggest an increase in the wind magnitude after eruption (e.g., Stenchikov et al.,

2009; Karpechko et al., 2010; Zanchettin et al., 2014; Stenchikov, 2016). Next, composite

maps analysis focus in understanding the southern hemisphere wind changes after the

eruptions, since this subject that is still in debate.

Composites Maps

Examination of the surface spatial distribution of the anomalies is useful to verify if

the volcanic eruptions have a different impact depending on the region and to verify how

it changes from one year to the other. Figures 3.13 to 3.16 represent air-sea properties

starting in composite Yr +1, since the volcanic response is not significant at 90% level

in the year of the explosion (Yr 0). TAUX and TAUY composite maps are only shown

between Yr +1 and Yr +4 (Figures 3.13 and 3.14), because these are the years that have

greater areas where the anomaly is significant at 90% level.

Zonal wind stress anomalies are the largest in the first year after the eruption as

seen in Figure 3.13a and in Figure 3.12a as well. Both results depict anomalies that are

consistent with Stenchikov et al. (2009). The authors point to a decrease of TAUX at 50S,

where this core of the tropospheric jet is located, and an increase at 70S. Results (Figure

3.13a) show significant negative anomaly at 45S and positive anomaly at 65S, suggesting a

poleward shift of the westerlies. This poleward shift of the prevailing westerlies is further

explored in Section 3.2.4. Even after smaller eruptions than those of the LM, such as

Mt. Pinatubo and El Chichón, westerlies intensification is seen (Karpechko et al., 2010).

In contrast, other studies do not report changes in the zonal wind in any region of the



41 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions

globe, such as Kim and Kim (2012). For the southern hemisphere, Robock et al. (2007)

also do not report tropospheric circulation changes due Mt. Pinatubo eruption.

Figure 3.13: Zonal wind stress composites | TAUX [N m?2] response to selected
eruptions for (a) Yr +1, (b) Yr +2,(c) Yr +3 and (d) Yr +4. Shown only for the austral
summer (DJF). Significance levels are determined according to the WRS test, and values
that are insignificant at 90% are marked with crosses.

Alterations in the wind system are expected after large eruptions, because of the

heating of the tropical stratosphere by volcanic aerosols (Robock, 2000; Timmreck, 2012).

This results in a stronger meridional temperature gradient (Robock, 2000; Roscoe and

Haigh, 2007), then, via thermal wind balance, it translates to strengthened polar vortex,

as observed in the northern hemisphere (Robock et al., 2007; Otterå, 2008; Timmreck,

2012), thus stronger winds (Karpechko et al., 2010). Results from here are in agreement

with what is expected from the dynamical atmosphere response to volcanic activity.

During Yr +2 (Figure 3.13b) the anomaly decays reaching values around 0.004N m?2,

but continues significant at 90% level. After, during the third subsequent year (Yr +3,

Figure 3.13c) the negative anomaly seems to have been displaced to the south, while the



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 42

positive anomaly in the Weddell Sea region is not significant anymore. During Yr +4

(Figure 3.13d) only some portions of the field are still significant. This suggests that for

the zonal wind stress the volcanic signal persist up to Yr +3.

Note that the ENSO connection with the wind circulation and volcanic activity is not

examinated in this work. Li et al. (2013) discuss that ENSO is not that important before

1880. Moreover, McGraw et al. (2016) point to a more positive SAM index, which implies

a more intense westerly circulation, after major tropical volcanic eruptions regardless of

ENSO state. Thus, results are relevant even if ENSO is not taken into account.

The meridional wind stress perturbation shows an interesting pattern at Yr +1 (Figure

3.14a), a significant positive anomaly of 0.01N m?2 in the northernmost region from 30S

to 50S and in the Weddell Sea eastern boundary. This is accompanied by a negative

anomaly of the same magnitude in the south of Weddell Sea, specifically in the northern

Antarctic Peninsula. Changes in the TAUY seems to be related to the poleward shift of

the westerlies, which is further explored in Section 3.2.4

The same TAUY positive anomaly in the Weddell Sea is present during the second

subsequent year (Figure 3.14b), however in the northern Antarctic Peninsula there is a

positive anomaly of 0.0075N m?2. At the same time that the northernmost region shows

a small (-0.0025N m?2), but significant negative anomaly. During Yr +3 (Figure 3.14c)

most of the anomalies in the study region are not significant. In the following year the

anomalies are significant again, but smaller than during Yr +1, probably not related to

the volcanic response (Figure 3.14d). Although TAUY anomalies last less (only to Yr

+2) than TAUX, the response to volcanism is meaningful. In addition, it has been little

explored before, yet its an important wind component of the Weddell circulation.

that are insignificant at 90% are marked with crosses.

SST and SSS composite results are shown between Yr +1 and Yr +5 in Figures 3.15

and 3.16. The cold anomaly north of 60S in the SST field shown in Figure 3.15a is

what is expected as the thermodynamic response to volcanic explosions (e.g., Robock,

2000; Church et al., 2005; Stenchikov et al., 2009; Mignot et al., 2011; Timmreck, 2012;

Ding et al., 2014; Pausata et al., 2015; Stenchikov, 2016). Figure 3.15a shows negative

anomalies ranging between 0.2 and 0.8?C. However, a significant positive temperature

anomaly in the Weddell Sea is also seen in Yr +1, that reaches 0.8?C. Yr +2 (Figure 3.15b)

still shows a strong negative anomaly in the northernmost region, the positive temperature

anomaly in the Weddell Sea seems to have spread and is less intense. The same is observed

in Yr +3 (Figure 3.15c). A plausible mechanism explaining the anomalous positive SST

after eruptions is discussed in Section 3.2.4.



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 44

(DJF). Significance levels are determined according to the WRS test, and values that are
insignificant at 90% are marked with crosses.

During Yr +4 (Figure 3.14d) the cold anomaly in the north domain has become

smaller than in Yr +1, yet significant. In the same year there is a warm plume in the

Drake Passage, which is also observed in Mignot et al. (2011), significant from years +3

to +5.

In the following year (Figure 3.15e, Yr +5) anomalies are similar to the previous year,

only with decreased warm surface anomaly. Thus, the volcanic signal in the SST persists

from four to five years after the eruption, fact that agrees with Church et al. (2005) results.

On the other hand, Stenchikov et al. (2009) and Kim and Kim (2012) have observed

SST recovery in the third year after the eruption. In fact, the signal persistence seems

to be very dependent on the region, which points to the importance of regional analysis

following eruptions.

In the SSS field, during Yr +1 (Figure 3.16a), there is significant positive anomaly

of 0.14, which shows two cores: one in the northern Weddell Sea near the Antarctic

Peninsula and the other at 40S. The overall increased surface salinity after eruptions



45 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions

agrees with previous studies (e.g., Stenchikov et al., 2009; Kim and Kim, 2012; Ding et al.,

2014; Stenchikov, 2016). Even though the anomalies are not located in regions of dense

water formation, the cold and saltier anomalies after eruptions have been suggested as an

important factor responsible for strengthening the AMOC (Otterå et al., 2010; Mignot

et al., 2011; McGregor et al., 2015; Pausata et al., 2015).

Figure 3.16: SSS composites | SSS response to selected eruptions for (a) Yr +1, (b) Yr
+2,(c) Yr +3, (d) Yr +4 and (e) Yr +5. Shown only for the austral summer (DJF). Signif-
icance levels are determined according to the WRS test, and values that are insignificant
at 90% are marked with crosses.

In the next year (Yr +2, Figure 3.16b), the salty cores remain almost the same, but

are accompanied by a fresher anomaly of ? 0.1 at the South American coast. At Yr +3

and +4 almost the same pattern of weaker positive anomaly in the Weddell Sea can be

seen in Figures 3.16c and 3.17d, but during Yr +3 there is a stronger negative anomaly.

Mignot et al. (2011) observed a negative sea surface salinity anomaly as well, but in the

northern subtropics, that was attributed to increased freshwater inputs. At the same

time, Trenberth and Dai (2007) discuss a decrease in global precipitation and discharge.

Further studies are necessary to understand the mechanism that controls the negative

salinity near South America in Earth System Models, which is not the present focus.

Finally, during Yr +5 (Figure 3.16e) there is still large regions showing significant,



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 46

but small anomalies, therefore the salinity seems to recover approximately within the

same period as the SST. This is different, from what is observed in Figure 3.21b, that

shows salinity recovery after Yr +3, because of the averaged area that probably masks

the real spreading of the spatial anomaly.

Last Millennium Individual Events

Two specific eruptions are analyzed to verify if there is volcano location dependency in

the air-sea properties response. All seven eruptions (Table 2.1) have been tested and two

representative ones from different location and intensities were chosen. The representative

tropical eruption is the well known Tambora explosion on 10 April 1815 in the Indonesia

region. For the south hemisphere 1341 eruption is chosen (see Figure 2.2), the specific

location of this eruption is not known. The individual events are shown only for the first

and second austral summers after each eruption (Yr +1 and +2).

In the Tambora eruption the wind stress, shown in Figure 3.17c,f, has intensified

during the first austral summer after the eruption, as the same seen in the composite

analysis (Figure 3.13a). In the following year the anomaly gets weaker. The SST (Figure

3.17a) also shows a pattern very similar to the composite average during the first year

after the eruption (Figure 3.15a), a cold anomaly in the northernmost region that reaches

0.6?C and the anomalous warming in the Weddell Sea near the Antarctic Peninsula.

However, it also shows a positive temperature anomaly in the central region of the South

Atlantic Ocean, between 40S and 50S, that is not evident in the composite average.

(second line) for [(a),(d)] SST [?C], [(b),(e)] SSS and [(c),(f)] wind stress [N m?2] in
which the magnitude is in the background and vectors represent the direction.

In the following year (Yr +2, Figure 3.17d) the positive temperature anomaly present

in the Weddell Sea remains with the same magnitude. This is different from what is

shown in the composite pattern, where the SST anomaly has decreased to half. It also

seems to have spread northward mixing with the central anomaly present since Yr +1.

Surface salinity (Figure 3.17a,e) shows a similar pattern to the composite average, strong

positive anomalies 0.16 mainly in the northern Antarctic Peninsula and a core in 40-50S.

In addition to a fresh anomaly of the same magnitude at the South American coast that

appears only in the second subsequent year.

As shown in Figure 3.18c,f, wind stress response to the 1341 eruption have also shown

a positive anomaly. Even though this volcanic eruption was weaker than the Tambora

explosion, the wind stress positive anomaly is of the same magnitude, but covering a

smaller area. The same happens for SSS (Figure 3.18b,e), with positive anomalies covering

almost the whole domain in Yr +1, decreasing in the following year.



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 48

(second line) for [(a),(d)] SST [?C], [(b),(e)] SSS and [(c),(f)] wind stress [N m?2] in
which the magnitude is in the background and vectors represent the direction.

The SST shows the same warming in the Weddell Sea region during the first year

after the eruption (Figure 3.18a), however the cold anomaly is much more spread out in

the region, reaching values of 0.8?C. This may be related to the volcano location that is

in the southern hemisphere, so there is a stronger response in SST to the radiative effect.

During Yr +2 (Figure 3.18d) the cold anomaly is zonal north of 50S, at the same time

that the positive anomaly has decreased and spread to the Weddell Sea interior.

Therefore, the individual volcanic eruptions from the LM show overall the same

pattern of the composite average. Even though some differences have been pointed,

the anomalous warming in the Weddell Sea is present in all, thus it is not an effect of

the composite method. The size of the eruption affect the air-sea properties response

(Meronen et al., 2012; Sigl et al., 2015), results (e.g., Figure 3.18c and 3.17c) show eruption

size dependency in the wind response. However, the size dependency may be masked by

the different volcano location.



49 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions

3.2.2 Vertical Analysis

Vertical Sections

Composite years of the potential temperature section in the Greenwich Meridian (0W)

are shown in Figure 3.19. The vertical sections starts from the first 15m, that is the first

vertical level from the CESM-LME, to 3000m depth. There is an evident cold anomaly of

0.4?C, mostly from 15m to 100m depth, between 60-50S and 40-30S that starts at Yr +1

(Figure 3.19a). Fact that is consistent with Ding et al. (2014) findings, the authors have

estimated a effective mixing depth in which the cooling is distributed of 85m. Stenchikov

et al. (2009) have pointed that the cold water begins to penetrate to depth around 40S,

which agrees with what is observed in this vertical section. The anomalies spread into

depth first north of 50S, implying that the subtropical regions are probably responding

first to the eruptions.

In the following year (Yr +2, Figure 3.19b) the cold anomaly has spread its signal

in depth. South of 50S the anomaly near the surface disappears, but there is still a

cold core between 100 and 250m. In contrast to the region north of 60S, where the cold

anomaly is deeper around 1000m. As described in Mignot et al. (2011) and Kim and

Kim (2012) the cold anomaly reaches its largest depth 2 to 3 years after the eruption,

which is explained by deep convective mixing. Even during Yr +6 there is still a small

cold anomaly (? ?0.1?C) at depth. There are not changes in the isopycnals.

The potential temperature section near the Antarctic Peninsula (54W) has been also

analyzed to verify the spreading of the positive temperature anomaly already observed at

the surface (Figure 3.20). Contrary to the Greenwich Meridian section, during the first

year after the eruption (Figure 3.20a) there is a positive temperature anomaly (0.4?C)

south of 60S, from 15m to 100m. At the same time, the cold anomaly of 0.4?C north of

60S is present as in the 0W section, spreading to 100m depth.

[?C] response to the selected eruptions. From Yr +1 to Yr +6 after the eruption, respec-
tively [(a)-(f)]. Black lines represent isopycnals.

In the second austral summer after the eruption (Figure 3.20b) the positive temper-

ature anomaly has weaken and disappears from the surface at Yr +4, staying only at

the subsurface (Figure 3.20d). The positive temperature anomaly seems to sink because

of the increased salinity in the same region, which is shown in Figure 3.21 and further

discussed in the vertical Hovmöller subsection.

Figure 3.20: Antarctic Peninsula (54W) section | Composite potential tempera-
ture [?C] response to the selected eruptions. From Yr +1 to Yr +6 after the eruption,
respectively [(a)-(f)]. Black lines represent isopycnals.

At the same time, the cold anomaly of 0.35?C seems to spread to even deeper layers

? 1000m, as also noted by Ding et al. (2014). In this section the anomalies, independent

of their signal, respect the isopycnals distribution as in the 0W section. At Yr +5 (Figure

3.20e) a positive anomaly smaller than 0.1?C is located at the subsurface between 100

and 1000m depth.



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 52

At Yr +6 (Figure 3.20f) the cold anomaly at the surface has been displaced southward

(between 45-60S). Different from what is observed at 0W, in which the cold anomaly

during Yr +6 only spreads south up to 45S. Fact that agrees with Kim and Kim (2012)

results of the cold signature persistence around 50S. The difference in the anomaly

spreading in each vertical section is probably related to the latitude where the isopycnals

reach the surface. Although there are differences in both sections, the cold anomaly is

still meaningful at Yr +6 with values ranging 0.06-0.3?C. Thus, the subsurface recovery

time scale is longer, because of the absence of air-sea fluxes (Delworth et al., 2005). In

addition, it may show a cumulative effect from near placed eruptions such as 1809 and

1815.

The cold anomaly that penetrates the layers around 1000m is small ? 0.025?C, agree-

ing with Ding et al. (2014) that found 0-1000m negative temperature anomalies of roughly

0.03K. Stenchikov et al. (2009) and Kim and Kim (2012) have observed smaller values of

0.005?C. However, the signal in the deeper layers is better evaluated in averages of the

OHC as in Church et al. (2005), because the changes are very small and hard to separate

from internal variability. The cooling signal is detected even in layers deeper than 2000m

(Stenchikov et al., 2009; Stenchikov, 2016). However, it is not yet meaningfully observed

in this analysis, which is probably due to the short analysis period, considering that the

spreading of the cold signal to the deeper ocean may take 15-20 years (Church et al.,

2005; Stenchikov et al., 2009).

Most of the literature focuses only in the temperature signal spreading into depth,

here the salinity anomaly is analyzed for the same sections (Figures 3.21 and 3.22). The

salinity behavior along depth is not as well defined as temperature, but it still respects

the isopycnal distribution. For the Greenwich Meridian section, at Yr +1 (Figure 3.21a)

a positive salinity anomaly (0.05) appears at the surface south of 40S approximately to

100m depth. North of 40S there is a fresher anomaly (-0.03) from 15m to 150m depth.

selected eruptions. From Yr +1 to Yr +6 after the eruption, respectively [(a)-(f)]. Black
lines represent isopycnals.

In deeper layers 100-250m, following the 27.25 isopycnal, there is also a negative

anomaly of 0.05, which seems to spread to even deeper layers and shift to the south in

the subsequent years (Figure 3.21a,b,c). At Yr +3 (FIgure 3.21c) the saltier anomaly

is confined in the southernmost region reaching only ?200m depth. After this year the

positive anomaly is much weaker (Figure 3.21d,e,f).



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 54

For the Antarctic Peninsula section (Figure 3.22), a similar patter emerges. In the

first year after the eruption (Figure 3.22a) a saltier anomaly is concentrated at the surface

(?50m) south of 60S and the fresh anomaly is near the surface north of 40S, but with

smaller magnitude (?-0.01) and in deeper layers it extends to 60S.

the selected eruptions. From Yr +1 to Yr +6 after the eruption, respectively [(a)-(f)].
Black lines represent isopycnals.



55 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions

During the subsequent year (Figure 3.22) the saltier anomaly extends into deeper

layers ?1000m and keeps the same until Yr +6 (Figure 3.22f). The positive anomaly

is no longer found at the surface layer at Yr +4 (Figure 3.22d) south of 60S. There is

smaller positive anomaly at the surface north of 60S, which has spread in Yr +6 (Figure

3.22f). This is different from what is observed in the 0W section, that has a negative

anomaly in this region for all composites years (Figure 3.21). At Yr +6 anomalies remain

meaningful, suggesting that salinity is probably perturbed for as long as temperature.

Both salinity sections show roughly a similar pattern of positive anomaly near the

surface and a negative anomaly in the deeper layers, mostly in the regions where isopycnals

reach the surface ?45-60S and 50-65S for 0W and 54W, respectively. This may be

explained by increased convection, which moves fresher surface water down and saltier

subsurface water upwards (Kim and Kim, 2012). Even though the anomalies in the salinity

and potential temperature vertical sections are significant, the isopycnal distribution does

not change between the composite years.

Hovmöller

To better understand if and how the anomalies are spreading in the subsequent

composite years, vertical Hovmöller diagrams (Figure 3.24) for two different regions

(Figure 3.23). The y-axis is the depth and the x-axis is the sequence of the composite

years from Yr -3 to the Yr +9. The dotted vertical line is the year of the eruption (Yr

0).The oceanic region boundaries are 0-10E and 30-34S (Figure 3.24a,b) and the Antarctic

Peninsula region is an average of 60-48W and 61-67S (Figure 3.24c,d). It should be taken

into account that the behavior is slightly different from the meridional sections, since this

is an averaged area.

marks the eruption year.



57 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions

These regions show opposite behavior after volcanic eruptions. The oceanic region

shows a negative anomaly of -0.3?C in the following year after the eruption that is in

the layer between surface and 100m depth (Figure 3.24a). It starts to penetrate into the

deeper ocean in the second year after the eruption, showing values of -0.16?C spreading

to ?500m. This anomaly decreases at the surface only after the fifth subsequent austral

summer, but on the deeper layers it remains ? ?0.16?C. In the layers deeper than 1000m

the anomaly is present, values of -0.06?C, but is not possible to say if it is related just to

the volcanic eruptions.

On the other hand, in the Antarctic Peninsula region (Figure 3.24c), after the eruption

there is a positive temperature anomaly between the surface and 100m. The 0.3?C

anomaly spreads at the surface to the third subsequent austral summer. From Yr +4

the anomalies at the surface have faded, but in the layers deeper than 150m a positive

temperature anomaly of about 0.08?C is present.

Deeper than 1000m there is a cold anomaly of -0.06?C starting somewhat at Yr +4

that gets weaker but extends to Yr +9. This could be related to the spreading of the

cold anomaly present in other regions at the surface to deeper layers (i.e., north of 50S).

The cold anomaly in deeper layers may last several decades to centuries (Stenchikov

et al., 2009; McGregor et al., 2015; Pausata et al., 2015; Stenchikov, 2016), which is

not evaluated in the present analysis because there is a superposition of the eruptions

composites, further analysis considering individual eruptions are required to verify and

isolate the volcanic signal in the deeper layers at decadal and longer time-scales.

The salinity anomaly in the oceanic region (Figure 3.24b) is mostly negative, while at

the Antarctic Peninsula region it is positive (Figure 3.24d). In the oceanic region (Figure

3.24b), there is a negative anomaly (? ?0.02), however it is difficult to separate from the

background condition of the years before the eruption, that also have shown a negative

anomaly of the same magnitude. The largest anomaly in this region occurs at Yr +3

of about 0.05 and spreads to 200m depth. This anomaly is found in the deeper layers

? 500m in Yr +5, but with smaller values.

The response in salinity to volcanism in the Antarctic Peninsula (Figure 3.24d) region



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 58

is a positive anomaly of 0.05 that starts in the first year after the eruption. This anomaly

from the surface to 150m remains the same until Yr +3, after it gets weaker (0.02) and

spread into deeper layers around 500m. Note that the positive potential temperature

anomaly seems to follow the positive salinity anomaly in the Antarctic Peninsula region,

which suggests that the salinity may control the sinking of this water. Therefore, even

though the positive potential temperature anomaly is not sufficiently dense to sink, it

is forced to sink in the following years (i.e., Yr +3 to +4) because of the increased in

density related to the saltier anomaly also present in the same region.

Another point to notice is the background condition, the years before the eruption

(i.e., Yr -1 and -2), for each region its different, thus the background condition could play

an important role (Zanchettin et al., 2013). In addition, in both regions the salinity and

temperature anomalies remain meaningful even at Yr +9, suggesting that the recovery

from volcanic eruption could take at least a decade Church et al. (2005); Gleckler et al.

(2006); Ding et al. (2014). At the same time, there is superposition of some events,

therefore, the Hovmöller diagram after year +6 could be showing a cumulative signal

from successive eruptions.

3.2.3 Water Masses Analysis

To verify if any of the significant anomalies at the surface would be able to impact

and modify water masses, the averaged Weddell Sea TS diagram is analyzed, shown in

Figure 3.25. The WDW is well represented, even if it is slightly warmer, up to 1.5?C,

compared to Nicholls et al. (2009). The only changes that are observed in the composite

years occur in the first ?200m. This could be explained by the longer time scale necessary

for a change at the surface to penetrate into the ocean deeper layers (Church et al., 2005;

Gleckler et al., 2006). Even during Yr +9 it is not possible to see meaningful changes in

layers deeper than 500m in this TS diagram analysis.

The small changes are hard to differentiate from the climatological average (thick grey

line), even in the zoom for the first 200m (Figure 3.25b). The Yr +2 (magenta line) shows



59 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions

larger changes compared to the climatological average. Most of the difference is located

approximately at 75m, showing a slightly increase in the salinity and temperature. This

is related to the first response due to volcanic events (see Figure 3.16 and 3.22), since

the larger anomalies have been observed to spread all the way to 200m.

Figure 3.25: TS diagram for the Weddell Sea | (a) Averaged Weddell Sea TS diagram
from surface to 2000m. (b) Zoom for the first ?100m. Climotological mean for the LM
is represented as the thick black line and different colors represent each composite year
that is described in the legend.

Even at Yr +9 the TS diagram has not shown changes in the deeper layers, such

as the WDW. Thus, the increase in some water production as the 10% increase in

AABW production identified by Kim and Kim (2012), is probably not related to changes

in precursors water masses of AABW formation or in these water masses thermohaline

characteristics. Therefore, further analysis are needed to verify if volcanism would be

able to imprint meaningful modifications in water masses hydrographic characteristics.

3.2.4 Regional Analysis: Weddell Sea

A special focus is given to the anomalous warming in the Weddell Sea related to

volcanic events, which has not been observed before. This section present results and

discussion of a regional analysis in which the dynamical aspects of this anomalous feature

is explained. Figure 3.26 depicts the same composite anomaly for SST and SSS at Yr +1,

only the significant regions at 90% are shown. The wind stress anomaly is superposed in



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 60

vectors.

It is expected that the aftermath of a volcanic event is an overall cooling of the surface

(Church et al., 2005; Ding et al., 2014; Stenchikov, 2016). This cooling acts to offset the

warming of the PD (Delworth et al., 2005; Gleckler et al., 2006), the anomalous warming

observed here would imply in opposite impact, as it would increase the anthropogenic

warming. Together with the warming, there is a positive salinity anomaly almost at the

same region, but spread eastward. This anomalous positive salinity after the eruption

could be linked to an anomalous sea-ice expansion (i.e., increased brine rejection) that

was discussed by Zanchettin et al. (2014). The authors observed that the Antarctic sea-ice

goes through an initial expansion phase during integration of the first and second years,

followed by a retraction after an eruption. The expansion phase would increase the sea

surface salinity through more brine rejection.

eruptions only showing DJF Yr +1 for (a) SST [?C] and (b) SSS anomalies. Vectors show
the wind stress anomaly. It is only shown regions that are significant at 90% according
to the WRS test.

The wind stress anomaly reveals an intensified westerly flow (represented by vectors

in Figure 3.26), which is further explored in Figures 3.27 and 3.28. The meridional wind

stress in the Weddell Sea climatological austral summer is a northward flow that inverts

its direction in the northernmost portion of the Antarctic Peninsula (continuous line in

Figure 3.27a). Due to volcanic eruption, the response in TAUY is a negative anomaly in



61 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions

the northern Antarctic Peninsula (Figure 3.27b). This anomaly is sufficient to invert the

circulation in this region as shown in Figure 3.27c that is the sum of the climatological

LM austral summer and the anomaly field during the year after the eruption (Yr +1).

The continuous line is the zero TAUY from the climatological austral summer and the

dotted line is the zero TAUY impacted by volcanic explosion.

Figure 3.27: Wind stress response at Yr +1 | The right-hand column is the LM
climatological mean, the central column the Yr +1 anomaly and the left-hand column

continuous line represent the zero contour for LM climatological mean and the dotted
line the zero contour resultant from the year after the eruption perturbation.

At the same time, the zonal wind stress also significantly changes, as can be seen in

Figure 3.27c,d,e. In the following austral summer after the eruption TAUX southernmost

extension, represented by the continuous line in Figure 3.27d, has dislocated southward

(dotted line in Figure 3.27c). It is also observed that the zonal wind stress has intensified

in ? 20% (0.03N m?2).

The southward migration of the prevailing westerlies is also shown in Figure 3.28, that

presents the TAUX zonal average for the austral summer climatology (continuous black

line), the composite Yr +1 (magenta line) and the composite Yr +8 (dotted blue line).



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 62

The polar shift of the westerlies of almost 2? shown by the horizontal lines is clearly seen.

The horizontal lines in Figure 3.28 elucidates the associated maximum zonal wind stress

position3 of the LM austral summer climatology and averaged composite Yr +1.

in green 8 years after the eruption (Yr +8). The vertical lines represent the associated
maximum zonal wind stress position for the climatology (black line) and Yr +1 (magenta
line).

Westerlies southward shift after the eruption have been observed before (Stenchikov

et al., 2009; Karpechko et al., 2010) in different simulations. Schneider et al. (2009) rather

than a poleward shift, discuss an equatorward shift of the westerlies in post-eruption

scenario in the CCSM3. McGraw et al. (2016), on the other hand, using the CESM

Large Ensemble experiment (LENS) suggest that the westerlies southward shift is in fact

a response after eruptions, however they discuss that the internal variability overwhelm

this change.

The differences between the northern Antarctic Peninsula (60-48W and 61-67S) and

an oceanic region (12-26E and 53-59S) is explored. The specific regions are shown in

Figure 3.29a. A standardized SEA comparing SST, SSS and TAUX composite evolution

for both regions is shown in Figure 3.29b,c.

between 12-26E and 53-59S. In [(a), (b)] the vertical continuous line marks the year of
the eruption (Yr 0) and the dotted line the first year after the eruption (Yr +1).

All air-sea properties show changes of the same magnitude in the first austral summer

after the eruption (Yr +1 vertical dotted line in Figure 3.29a,b). Immediately in the

subsequent year the anomalies start to decay and by the Yr +5 get back to magnitude

comparable to the year before the eruption (Yr -1). Changes after the eruption are of 1.5

standard deviation in both regions, but with different signals. The northern Antarctic

Peninsula shows positive anomaly for all properties, contrasting with the oceanic region

that presents negative SST and SSS anomaly and positive TAUX anomaly. Despite the

same wind response after the eruption, the oceanic properties respond differently.

SST perturbation observed in the oceanic region is the expected cooling response due

to the radiative effect of volcanic eruptions (Robock, 2000; Church et al., 2005; Ding

et al., 2014; Pausata et al., 2015; Stenchikov, 2016). Instead the surface warming near

the Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea may be controlled by changes at the surface

winds. The significant wind stress field change immediately impact the ocean surface

velocity (Figure 3.30).

The austral summer climatological velocity at the surface is shown in Figure 3.30a,

the thick grey arrows represent the southern extent of the ACC that is stronger than

the surface Weddell Gyre represented in black thin arrows. Each velocity component is

represented in Figure 3.30b,c, and the anomalies due to volcanic explosion at Yr +1 are

depicted in Figure 3.30d,e. The UVEL and VVEL surface anomalies represent a 10%

to ? 14% increase in the flow, respectively, mainly in the southern extent of the ACC

(Figure 3.30a), which agrees with Kim and Kim (2012). While, somehow the Weddell

Gyre is a bit weaker, decrease of ? 8% in its zonal component in the eastern domain near

the Antarctic continent. The VVEL near the Antarctic Peninsula after the eruption is

highly influenced by the ACC southern extension flux.

The stronger ACC southern extent is enhancing mixing in the northern Antarctic

Peninsula region. There is not any warmer water at the surface coming to the Weddell

region. Thus, the positive temperature anomaly from Figure 3.26a is probably explained

by deeper layer circulation. To explore this, the typical SR4 WOCE transect4 (Figure

3.6a) that covers both the inflow and outflow regions of the Weddell Gyre is examined.

Temperature anomaly shows (Figure 3.31a) small increase of 0.08?C in the inflow

region, deeper than 200m. In the northern hemisphere, Zhong et al. (2011) observe a

subsurface warming after sequenced eruptions which is attributed to weakened convection,

a similar mechanism may explain the subsurface heating of this region. At the same time,

in the outflow region the positive anomaly is concentrated in layers shallower than 100m,

which suggests that the water getting in the Weddell Gyre subsurface is slightly warmer,

but the water that is at the subsurface outflow is not. This is probably related to the

observed changes at the subsurface circulation in the Weddell Sea (Figure 3.31b).

Figure 3.31b shows the VVEL anomaly along the depth for the first year after the

eruption. During Yr +1, there is a negative anomaly in the subsurface outflow region

of ? 0.12cm s?1 that reaches 400m deep. At the same time, at the surface and easterly

dislocated a positive anomaly of the same magnitude. This shows that the outflow
4The closest model grid points from the original stations in SR4 WOCE transect have been selected

to this analysis.



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 66

velocity has decreased in the original position in 16%. The anomalous positive VVEL

in the surface is related to the increased southward ACC extension showed in Figure

3.30d,e.

Figure 3.31: WOCE SR4 transect | Composite response to the selected eruptions
during the first year after the eruption (yr +1) for (a) potential temperature anomaly
[?C] and (b) VVEL anomaly [cm s?1]. The inflow and outflow regions are marked,
respectively 71.5S,11W and 63.5S,53W.

Therefore, the anomalous warm surface responds more strongly not to the radiative

forcing, but to changes in the ocean dynamics in the first austral summer after the

eruption (Yr +1):

1. Winds: Along the outflow region in the Weddell Sea, the northward winds are

pushed southwards with the southward (negative) anomalies north of the Antarctic

Peninsula extending west. At the same time, the westerlies are stronger and shift

south into most of the Weddell Sea.

2. Surface Circulation: As a response to the wind changes, the ACC southern extension

is stronger, enhancing mixing at the surface outflow region. Therefore, the Weddell



67 3.2. Last Millennium eruptions

Gyre outflow region is more influenced by the ACC southern extension.

3. Subsurface Circulation: At the subsurface layer, ? 600m depth, the Weddell Gyre

outflow is weakened and the inflow region is somehow warmer (0.08?C). This means

that some of the subsurface water that is supposed to be exported out of the Weddell

Gyre has been trapped in the region near the Antarctic Peninsula.

4. This scenario of enhanced mixing and the warmer subsurface water accumulated

in the outflow region is bringing up warmer and saltier subsurface waters (i.e.,

WDW). This waters get trapped at the surface outflow region because of the

reversed meridional wind anomalies and the southward shifted westerlies.

The schematics on Figure 3.32 represent in summary the suggested mechanism.

represent the temperature anomaly for the year after the eruption (Yr +1). The wind
circulation is represented (yellow and blue arrows), the inflow and outflow of the Weddell
Gyre in green and blue, respectively.



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 68

The idea is that the positive SST anomaly resulting from volcanic eruptions, observed

at the northern part of the Antarctic Peninsula is a result of the Weddell Sea ocean

dynamics. It is explained by the Weddell Gyre response to the southward shift and

strengthening of the westerlies together with the southward wind anomalies at the outflow

region. At this region, warm and salty WDW waters, through convective mixing, reaches

surface layers. Because of the anomalous wind, the outflow is stifled leading to the

positive SST anomaly detected.

3.3 Modern Eruption: Mt. Pinatubo

To test if the model results have an impact on the real world, the ocean response to

Mt. Pinatubo eruption in 1991 is investigated using observations and ocean reanalysis

(ERSSTv5 and SODA, respectively). The fact that this eruption was considerably smaller

than the LM eruptions and that the ocean response is also a result of increased post

industrial GHG and ozone depletion forcing is being considered.

If the anomalous warming after an eruption is observed in the PD, the volcanic forcing

could actually enhance the warming response associated with anthropogenic forcing at

the Weddell Sea and Antarctic Peninsula. The SST spatial pattern evolution for the Mt.

Pinatubo eruption from the CESM-LME, ERSSTv5 observed product and SODA ocean

reanalysis are shown in Figure 3.33.



69 3.3. Modern Eruption: Mt. Pinatubo

right-hand column for SODA [(c), (f), (i), (l)]. Each line represent different years from
1991 (Yr 0, the eruption year) to 1994 (Yr +3).

Mt. Pinatubo explosion response in CESM-LME shows signals during the year of the

eruption (Yr 0, 1991 Figure 3.33a). In this year a positive temperature anomaly of 0.8?C

is present in the Weddell Sea and between 54S and 66S there is a cold anomaly of on

average 0.6?C. North of 54S there is a positive temperature anomaly that is probably

not related to the volcanic eruption. In the first austral summer after the eruption (1992,



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 70

Figure 3.33d) the same pattern is present and in the second year (1993, Figure 3.33g) it

starts to fade, the warm surface anomaly in the Antarctic Peninsula is of 0.4?C. The Yr

+3 (1994, Figure 3.33j) shows a cold anomaly in the Weddell Sea and a positive anomaly

in the northern portion of the region.

Results from ERSSTv5 for the year of eruption (1991, Figure 3.33b) show positive

anomalies, mostly west of 40W, which are probably related to the anthropogenic effect.

Mt. Pinatubo cooling effect starts in the first year after the eruption (Yr +1, 1992

Figure 3.33e), in this same year a small region next to the Antarctic Peninsula has

warmed. This warming is larger at Yr +2 (1993, Figure 3.33h) reaching 0.8?C, but is

accompanied by a large warming of the same magnitude at the Drake Passage. During

Yr +3 (1994, Figure 3.33k) the anomaly at the Drake Passage disappears, however the

positive temperature anomaly in the Weddell Sea is still present. Finally, shown in Figure

3.33 right-hand column, results from SODA depict overall similar anomalies pattern,

albeit larger values with a maximum SST anomaly of 2?C. During the eruption year

(1991, Figure 3.33c) SODA shows a similar pattern to ERSSTv5. The warm surface

anomaly near the Antarctic Peninsula only appears in the second subsequent austral

summer (Yr +2, 1993 Figure 3.33i) reaching values of 1.5?C. At Yr +3 (1994, Figure

3.33l) the Weddell Sea anomaly is smaller.

All data sets compared here have shown the expected cooling pattern, the magnitude is

larger than other studies, which may be related to the study region. For example, Church

et al. (2005) have shown model results of 0.4? negative anomaly, while observations are

of the order of ? 0.3?C. Also for model simulations, a cooling of 0.25?C is observed in

Mignot et al. (2011) and Kim and Kim (2012). Furthermore, Ding et al. (2014) have

observed in CMIP5 a global average cooling of 0.3?C. CESM-LME and ERSSTv5 agree

more closely to previous studies than the results from SODA, which may be linked to

the SODA higher spatial resolution.

Differences between each year and a background reference field (Yr -1, 1990) are also

shown in Figure 3.34. During Mt. Pinatubo eruption the background conditions are

highly influenced by anthropogenically forcings (Gleckler et al., 2006; Zanchettin et al.,



71 3.3. Modern Eruption: Mt. Pinatubo

2013), therefore the background condition may influence even more than during the LM.

Figure 3.34: SST [?C] differences relative to the year before the Mt. Pinatubo
eruption (1991) | Left-hand column for CESM-LME [(a), (d), (g), (j)], central column

Each line represent different years from 1991 (Yr 0, the eruption year) to 1994 (Yr +3).

Considering the difference between Yr -1 (1990) and all other years in the CESM-LME

(Figure 3.34 left-hand column) it is evident that the only region that has warmed after

Mt. Pinatubo eruption is the Weddell Sea. Except for a small region in the northeast

domain that shows warming in 1994. The positive temperature anomaly is present in



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 72

this results from 1991 to 1993, with difference of 0.9?C from the background.

The ERSSTv5 (Figure 3.34 central column) shows warming compared to the year

before Mt. Pinatubo eruption in the northeast domain in the year of the eruption (1991)

and during the first year after the eruption (1992). However, in Yr +2 (1993, Figure

3.34h) there is a 0.9?C warming in the Weddell Sea. The difference between the Yr -1

(1990) and all other years for SODA (Figure 3.34 right-hand column) shows the same

warming in the northeast domain during the year of the eruption. The warming pattern

in the Weddell Sea starts at Yr +1 (1992, Figure 3.34f) and is still present at Yr +2 (1993,

Figure 3.34i). At Yr +2 the difference in relation to the year before the eruption (1990)

reaches 0.9?C and is spread out in the Weddell Sea. Most of the domain shows a cooling

pattern, except some regions, such as between 60-72S and 30-10W, that shows positive

difference relative to 1990.

As discussed in Section 3.2.4 the time series for two contrasting regions are shown for

SST in Figure 3.35. In the Antarctic Peninsula region (Figure 3.35a) the larger signal

after the eruption occurs in the second subsequent year (Yr +2, 1993). This signal is a

positive anomaly, which differs in magnitude between the data sets. As seen in Figure

3.33 right-hand column SODA shows larger anomalies, but all data sets have warmed

after Mt. Pinatubo eruption in this region. During 1991 austral summer the anomaly is

almost zero for ERSSTv5 and CESM-LME, but in the SODA results there is a negative

anomaly of 0.5?C.

On the other hand, the oceanic region (Figure 3.35b) contrasts with the Antarctic

Peninsula, where during Yr +2 (1993) all data sets show zero anomaly. The larger

response occurs in the year of the eruption (1991), but the data sets diverge. SODA

shows a positive anomaly of 0.5?C, while CESM-LME shows a negative anomaly of the

same magnitude.

Figure 3.35: SST [?C] anomaly time series | (a) Antarctic Peninsula region and (b)
oceanic region, the same regions as Figure 3.29. The different data sets are represented
in colors as described in the legend. The continuous vertical line mark the eruption year
(Yr 0, 1991) and the dotted vertical line the second year after the eruption (Yr +2, 1993).

Even though it is difficult to separate the volcanic signal from other forcings in the

PD (Church et al., 2005), the warming signal in the Weddell Sea is detected in all data

sets at Yr +2. The fact that the volcanic triggered warming happens only at Yr +2

in the observations may be explained by the background conditions. Zanchettin et al.

(2013) discuss that the existence of multiple response pathways is possible depending

on the background condition, therefore the already existing warming may have delayed

the oceanic response in the Weddell Sea. Another important point worth emphasizing is

that Mt. Pinatubo eruption is much shorter lived compared to LM eruptions because, as

mentioned in Gleckler et al. (2006), it occurred relative to a ongoing anthropogenically

forced ocean warming.

Finally, to verify if the wind stress displays the same changes as in the LM results,

the zonal and meridional wind stress are analyzed (Figures 3.36 and 3.37). The similarity

of these changes with the composite ones are important, since TAUX and TAUY have

been considered the trigger to the positive anomaly anomaly generated after the LM

eruptions. Results from Mt. Pinatubo SODA and CESM-LME reveal similar results

(Figure 3.36a,b respectively). The prevailing westerlies have increased in magnitude and

also shifted southward as observed in the LM (Karpechko et al., 2010; Zanchettin et al.,



Chapter 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 74

2014; Stenchikov, 2016).

Figure 3.36: Zonal wind stress [N m?2] zonal average for the South Atlantic
Ocean | (a) CESM-LME and (b) SODA. The dotted line is the climatological DJF
mean for the period of 1980-2005. The vertical lines represent the associated maximum
zonal wind stress position for the climatology (black line) and Yr +1 (magenta line).

Overall, the SODA zonal wind stress is smaller in magnitude than CESM-LME (0.15N

m?2 and 0.175N m?2 maximum respectively). Figure 3.36 shows the zonal average of

TAUX for CESM-LME and SODA, the black dotted line is the austral summer climatology

for the period 1980-2005. The first year after the eruption (Yr +1, 1992) shows the

prevailing westerlies southward drift for both data sets, in CESM-LME of ? 1? and

SODA ? 2? represented by the horizontal lines in Figure 3.36. Although in SODA during

the eruption year (1991) TAUX has shown larger maximum, there is no southward drift.

In both cases the zonal wind stress has become smaller than the climatology in 1993 (Yr

+2) austral summer.

The largest TAUY response to Mt. Pinatubo eruption has been during the first

austral summer after the eruption (1992), as seen in Figure 3.37.

Figure 3.37: Meridional wind estress response at yr +1 | The right-hand column
is 1980-2005 TAUY [N m?2] climatological mean, in the central column the Yr +1 (1992)
anomaly and the left-hand column the sum of both for [(a), (b), (c)] CESM-LME and
[(d), (e), (f)] SODA. The continuous line represent the zero contour of the climatological
mean and the dotted line the zero contour resultant from the year after Mt. Pinatubo
eruption (1992).

However, in the northern Antarctic Peninsula region the anomalies are not enough to

change the circulation, as observed in the LM. That is probably because the climatological

TAUY zero contour in the modern period is already placed in the Weddell Sea. This

supports the idea that the westerlies southward drift may be enough to trigger the surface

warm anomaly in the Weddell Sea post-eruption scenario.

Extracting the volcanic signal from observations, such as SODA and ERSSTv5, is dif-

ficult given the relatively short-lived forcing (Meronen et al., 2012) and the anthropogeni-

cally forced background (Gleckler et al., 2006; Zanchettin et al., 2013). Mt. Pinatubo

SST at Yr +2 after eruption scenario response near the Antarctic Peninsula may be

warming, rather than the expected cooling that would act as offset of the anthropogenic

warming (Delworth et al., 2005; Gleckler et al., 2006). Moreover, surface warming driven

at least partially by the southward shift of the westerlies at Yr +1 may have potential

impacts for recent sea-ice production and melt.



4 CONCLUSIONS

The response of the South Atlantic Ocean, including the Weddell Sea, to volcanic

eruptions was evaluated using simulation results from the Last Millennium Ensemble

experiment of the Community Earth System Model (CESM-LME). Despite the uncer-

tainties related to complex earth system models (Zanchettin et al., 2017), the use of 15

ensembles and 7 eruptions (a total of 105 events) allowed a solid description of air-sea ma-

jor impacts and to separate the forced climate response from internal variability (Fasullo

et al., 2017). In this sense, this study emphasize the importance of ensemble experiments

to reproduce the internal dynamics of the coupled climate system for interpretation of

simulated regional past climates (Zanchettin et al., 2012).

Volcanism is the cause of great non-anthropogenic perturbations on the Earth climate

through energy imbalance changes. Air-sea properties showed evident and significant (at

90% level) response to the volcanic forcing in the first austral summer after the eruption

(Yr +1), the surface presented an overall cooling, on average 0.6-0.8?C, located at specific

latitudes (i.e., 30S and 65S), which is robust given the small ensemble spread in the time

series. Results also showed SSS general increase of 0.06 between 40-50S, that was above

the internal variability. In the zonal wind stress composite a positive anomaly in 60S

(0.02N m?2) was identified, accompanied by negative anomaly of the same magnitude

at 45S. While the meridional wind stress field depicted a negative anomaly of 0.006N

m?2 located near the Antarctic Peninsula, and a great positive anomaly in 45S of 0.01N

m?2. Surface properties had different recovery periods, TAUX and TAUY were close to

the background condition of Yr -1, generally at Yr +3. However, SST and SSS was still

significant at least up to Yr +5. Moreover, different relaxation periods were observed

dependent on the latitude, both at the surface and at depth, suggesting that higher

latitudes may recover faster for SST and SSS anomalies.



77

In this context, composite analysis also pointed to different regional signals, such

as the positive temperature anomaly (0.8?C) accompanied by positive salinity anomaly

(? 0.16) developed near the Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea.

The present analysis suggested that the anomalous warm ocean surface responds

more strongly to changes in the ocean dynamics, rather than to the radiative forcing (i.e.,

expected cooling), as consequence of the volcanic forcing. During the first austral summer

after the eruption (Yr +1), a strengthening of 0.03N m?2 of the prevailing westerlies was

observed, which was accompanied by a southward shift of ? 2?. At the same time, the

wind circulation over the Weddell Sea became confined, which led to total inversion of

the meridional component of the wind stress near the northern Antarctic Peninsula. The

meridional wind changed from a northward to a southward circulation near the Antarctic

Peninsula northernmost extension. As a response to the wind changes, the ACC southern

extent increased in about 10%, enhancing mixing in the northern Antarctic Peninsula in

the Weddell Sea. In addition, around ? 600? depth, the Weddell Gyre outflow weakened

in ? 16%, at the same time that the inflow region warmed (0.08?C). Thus, some of

the water that was supposed to be exported out of the Weddell Gyre is trapped in the

subsurface region near the Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea.

Thus, changes in the meridional wind stress in the northern Antarctic Peninsula,

accumulated warmer subsurface water in the Weddell Sea outflow region and the enhanced

mixing near the Antarctic Peninsula, favors the formation of the detected positive SST

anomaly. It was suggested that the subsurface water, such as the WDW that is warmer

and saltier than the surface water, is brought up to the surface by the enhanced mixing.

Because of the anomalous wind this water get trapped in the Weddell Sea surface outflow

region. Thus, a warmer and saltier anomaly is formed after the eruption. In addition,

sea-ice may increase its extension after an eruption (Zanchettin et al., 2014), which would

contribute to increase the local salinity due to enhanced brine rejection.

The present study also evaluated the volcanic induced changes with depth. It was

observed that the positive temperature anomaly of 0.3?C near the Antarctic Peninsula

extends down to ? 100m at Yr +1, then forced to sink at Yr +3 to +4, because of



Chapter 4. CONCLUSIONS 78

the increased salinity, that results in denser waters. The sinking of this water would

only happen after the wind forcing has faded at Yr +2, suggesting that the change in

the prevailing westerlies is the trigger for the anomalous warming near the Antarctic

Peninsula after the eruption. At the same time, further north (?45S), the cold anomaly

(0.4?C) spreads down to 500-1000m from Yr +2 and still meaningful at Yr +6. Despite

the interface of some volcanic events, it was suggested that the recovery from the volcanic

eruption at depth could take at least a decade.

The 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo was one of the strongest volcanic eruptions of

the 20?? century and this well observed eruption served as an important case study to

understand and verify mechanisms that were identified as consequence of LM eruptions.

Even though the volcanic signal is difficult to separate from the other forcings in the

PD, the anomalous surface warming in the Antarctic Peninsula after the eruption was

observed at Yr +2 (1993). It was in agreement for all data sets, with SODA presenting

greater SST response of ?1-2?C than CESM-LME and ERSSTv5. The latter two showed

warming of 0.8?C. The delayed response compared to the LM eruptions was probably

relate to the PD background conditions, which accounts for an already exiting warming.

This result is also supported by the zonal wind stress increase at Yr +1 (1992). In

addition and more important, the prevailing westerlies have shifted south. The meridional

wind stress did not show reversion of direction in the northern Antarctic Peninsula,

because the climatological (1980-2005) meridional wind stress zero contour was already

displaced south. Fact that supports the idea that the westerlies southward drift triggers

the SST positive anomaly formation in the northern Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell

Sea. Therefore, the present analysis suggested that the Mt. Pinatubo and LM eruptions

involve similar mechanisms, although there is a delayed SST response.

In this sense, the post-eruption aftermath in a regional context such as for the northern

Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea may not act as an offset of the anthropogenic

warming as suggested in Delworth et al. (2005) and Gleckler et al. (2006). Moreover,

surface warming after an eruption may have potential impacts for recent sea-ice production

and melt, given the high sea-ice sensitivity to the stability of the seawater column, wind



79

and ocean currents (Zhong et al., 2011).

Another interesting aspect that has been recently studied by Fasullo et al. (2017) is the

potential climate implications of future eruptions. The authors showed that in a global

warming scenario, the surface climate response to the eruption is amplified. Authors

emphasized that even an amplified cooling remains much less than the associated warming

of the anthropogenic forcing. Therefore, an eruption response such as the warming near

Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea shown in the present analysis, would be a potential

amplifying factor for the ongoing global warming. How the warming observed in the LM

and Mt. Pinatubo would respond to increased background warming should be under

further investigation. Finally, the use of isotopes in complex climate models (Colose et al.,

2016) to better understand the consequences of the volcanic forcing could be key approach

to verify the robustness of the already suggested mechanism. Therefore, continuing to

study the dynamical response mechanisms of great volcanic eruptions (e.g., Fasullo et al.,

2017), validating the climate models with observations, proxy data (e.g., Stevenson et al.,

2016), reanalysis data sets, and other new resources as isotopes, remains an useful exercise

for improving the understanding of climate variability in longer time scales.
