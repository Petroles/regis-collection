LEAST LIMITING WATER RANGE IN SOIL UNDER CROP

ROTATIONS AND CHISELING(1)

SUMMARY

Soil water availability to plants is affected by soil compaction and other
variables.  The Least Limiting Water Range (LLWR) comprises soil physical
variables affecting root growth and soil water availability, and can be managed by
either mechanical or biological methods.  There is evidence that effects of crop
rotations could last longer than chiseling, so the objective of this study was to
assess the effect of soil chiseling or growing cover crops under no-till (NT) on the
LLWR.  Crop rotations involving triticale (X Triticosecale) and sunflower
(Helianthus annuus) in the fall-winter associated with millet (Pennisetum
glaucum), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) as cover
crops preceding soybean (Glycine max) were repeated for three consecutive years.
In the treatment with chiseling (performed only in the first year), the area was left
fallow between the fall-winter and summer crops.  The experiment was carried
out in Botucatu, São Paulo State, Brazil, from 2003 to 2006 on a Typic Rhodudalf.
The LLWR was determined in soil samples taken from the layers 0–20 cm and 20–
40 cm, after chemical desiccation of the cover crops in December of the first and
third year of the experiment.  Chiseling decreases soil bulk density in the 0–20 cm
soil layer, increasing the LLWR magnitude by lowering the soil water content at
which penetration resistance reaches 2.0 MPa; this effect is present up to the third
year after chiseling and can reach to a depth of 0.40 m.  Crop rotations involving
sunflower + sunn hemp, triticale + millet and triticale + sunn hemp for three years
prevented soil bulk density from exceeding the critical soil bulk density in the 0–
0.20 m layer.  This effect was observed to a depth of 0.40 m after three years of
chiseling under crop rotations involving forage sorghum.  Hence, chiseling and
some crop rotations under no tillage are effective in increasing soil quality assessed
by the LLWR.

Index terms: cover crops, crop rotation, soil compaction, no till, soil water.

RESUMO:     INTERVALO HÍDRICO ÓTIMO EM SOLO SOB ROTAÇÃO DE
CULTURAS E ESCARIFICAÇÃO

A disponibilidade de água às plantas é alterada pela compactação do solo e outras
variáveis.  O Intervalo Hídrico Ótimo (IHO) integra variáveis físicas do solo que alteram o
crescimento radicular e a disponibilidade de água e pode ser manejado por métodos mecânicos
ou biológicos.  Há evidências de que os efeitos da rotação de culturas são mais duradouros que
os da escarificação.  O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o efeito da escarificação e, ou, rotação
de culturas em sistema de semeadura direta (SSD) no IHO.  Rotações envolvendo triticale (X
Triticosecale) e girassol (Helianthus annuus) no outono-inverno e milheto (Pennisetum
glaucum), sorgo (Sorghum bicolor) e crotalária (Crotalaria juncea) com plantas de cobertura
precedendo a soja (Glycine max) foram repetidas por três anos.  No tratamento com escarificação,
a área foi deixada em pousio entre as culturas de outono-inverno e verão.  O experimento foi
conduzido em Botucatu, São Paulo, Brasil, de 2003 a 2006 em um Nitossolo Vermelho.  O
IHO foi determinado em amostras de solo das profundidades de 0–20 e 20–40 cm, logo após a
dessecação química das plantas de cobertura, em dezembro do primeiro e do terceiro ano do
experimento.  A escarificação diminui a densidade do solo na camada de 0–20 cm, aumentando
o IHO por meio da redução da umidade do solo em que a resistência à penetração atinge
2,0 MPa; esse efeito mantém-se até o terceiro ano após a escarificação, podendo chegar a até
40 cm de profundidade.  As rotações de culturas envolvendo girassol + crotalária, triticale +
milheto e triticale + crotalária por três anos ajudaram a prevenir o aumento na densidade do
solo acima do valor crítico na camada de 0–20 cm.  Esse efeito é observado na camada de 20–
40 cm após três anos da escarificação e com rotações de culturas envolvendo sorgo.  Assim, a
escarificação e algumas rotações de culturas em sistema de semeadura direta são eficientes em
melhorar a qualidade do solo avaliada pelo IHO.

Termos de indexação: plantas de cobertura, rotação de culturas, compactação do solo, semeadura
direta, água no solo.

INTRODUCTION

The factors that affect plant growth and development
directly (oxygen, water, temperature and mechanical
impediment) are not only influenced by soil structure
(bulk density, aggregation state and porosity), but also
by climate, which vary from year to year (Dexter,
1988).  Thus, it is difficult to define critical limits beyond
which crop growth and development is impaired
(Torres &amp;amp; Saraiva, 1999).  The recognition of these
interactions suggests that soil physical quality should
be assessed using parameters that integrate the
physical characteristics of the soil affecting plant
growth, and using water as an equilibrium variable,
diminishing or aggravating the effects of aeration and
soil penetration resistance (Letey, 1985).

Plant growth is affected when soil physical-hydric
characteristics such as aeration porosity, root
penetration resistance and/or soil water content
impairs water acquisition.  The interaction of these
attributes in a single variable was defined by Silva et
al. (1994) as the “Least Limiting Water Range”
(LLWR).  According to these authors, root growth is
less restricted within this interval, whose upper limit
is the soil water content at field capacity (FC) or the
soil water content when the air-filled porosity equals
10 %.  The LLWR lower limit is the soil water content

at the permanent wilting point (PWP) or the soil water
content where soil penetration resistance is equal to
2.0 MPa.  There are reports showing that soil
management systems leading to lower LLWR expose
crops to more frequent stress due to excess or lack of
water (Kay, 1990; Silva &amp;amp; Kay, 1996; Lapen et al.,
2004).

Soil water contents at the adequate aeration
porosity and soil penetration resistance (SR) are more
severely affected by soil bulk density (Db) than by soil
water contents at FC and PWP, indicating that the
LLWR is more sensitive to soil structural changes
than the available water (Silva et al., 1994; Tormena
et al., 1998; Betz et al., 1998; Zou et al., 2000).  Thus,
soil water contents to avoid limitations to plant growth
vary with the state of soil compaction (Silva et al.,
1994), and compaction alleviation may result in higher
water availability to plants in addition to decreasing
SR.

Soil compaction alleviation can be achieved by
mechanical and/or biological processes.  In the
mechanical method, equipments with shanks are
preferred because they operate below the compacted
layer, have less surface contact and soil tillage is low
(Vernetti Júnior &amp;amp; Gomes, 1999).  However, there is
evidence that the positive effects of chiseling are short-
lived (Araujo et al., 2004; Busscher et al., 2002).  On

the other hand, important benefits have been observed
in soil structure in the medium and long terms as a
result of cover crops (Fidalski et al., 2010) with high-
carbon fixing potential and vigorous, deep root systems
(Dias Júnior, 2000), able to grow through soil layers
with high resistance to penetration and creating
biopores where the roots of the subsequent crop can
grow (Silva &amp;amp; Rosolem, 2001a).  Black oat, pigeon pea
and pearl millet favor soybean root growth below
compacted soil layers (Silva &amp;amp; Rosolem, 2002) resulting
in better mineral nutrition (Silva &amp;amp; Rosolem, 2001b),
however, the effects on soil bulk density and
penetration resistance were not clear.  Although
grasses are generally more sensitive to high soil
penetration resistance, they have high root length
densities in compacted soil layers.  This was observed
for pearl millet and grain sorghum that are also very
efficient in recycling nutrients.  These two species
proved to be very appropriate as cover crops in tropical
regions with dry winters (Rosolem et al., 2002; Silva
&amp;amp; Rosolem, 2003).

In view of the transient effect of chiseling, and that
the positive effects of cover crops on root growth and
development of cash crops as well as the effects of
crop rotations on soil water availability are not well
understood, the objective of this study was to determine
the effects of soil compaction management with
chiseling and no-till cover crops on the least limiting
water range of a tropical soil.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

An experiment was carried out in Botucatu, State
of São Paulo, Brazil, from 2003 to 2006 on a Typic
Rhodudalf (Soil Survey Staff, 2006) or Nitossolo
Vermelho distroférrico A moderado (Embrapa, 2006),
in an area that had been under no tillage for six years,
with a soybean/black oats/corn/triticale rotation.  The
geographic location of this area is latitude 22 ° 49 ’ S,

longitude 48 ° 25 ’ WGrw and 786 m asl.  The climate
(Köppen classification) is CWa, i.e., a subtropical humid
climate with dry winter.  The dry season is well-
defined between May and September.  The mean
annual rainfall is approximately 1,400 mm, the
highest monthly mean temperature is over 22 °C and
the lowest below 18 °C.  Before starting the experiment,
a one meter-deep trench was opened and a compacted
layer was diagnosed 5 to 20 cm deep in the soil profile.
The soil was then sampled for chemical (Raij et al.,
2001) and physical (Embrapa, 1997) analyses (Table 1).
The soil resistance (SR) of the profile was determined
using an electronic penetrograph.

Treatments consisted of planting triticale (X
Triticosecale Wittmack) and sunflower (Helianthus
annuus) in the fall-winter, combined with pearl millet
(Pennisetum glaucum L., var.  BN-2), forage sorghum
(Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and sunn hemp
(Crotalaria juncea L.) in the spring, and an additional
treatment that was chiseled, all preceding the summer
crop (soybean – Glycine max L. (Merrill), var.
Embrapa 48).  The chisel plow had seven shanks on
two parallel bars on a square tool carrier.  The shanks,
inclined 25° forward, were fixed 0.60 m apart,
resulting in an effective between-shank spacing of
0.30 m, with a maximum depth of 0.30 m.  A clod-
breaking roller was attached to break the biggest clods,
decrease surface roughness and spare disking.
Soybean was grown in summer in all plots.  The crop
sequence was repeated for three years.  The soil was
chiseled only once, that is, after the fall-winter crop
harvest in the first year, and the chiseled plots were
left fallow between the winter and summer crops
thereafter.  The experiment was evaluated in a
complete randomized block design with a split-plot
arrangement of treatments, with four replications.
Triticale and sunflower were grown in the plots in
the fall/winter with pearl millet, sorghum, sunn hemp,
and chiseling in sub-plots.  Plots were 8.0 x 32.0 m,and
sub-plots 8.0 x 5.0 m, and blocks, plots and sub-plots
were 4.0 m apart.

Soybean fertilization with P and K followed specific
recommendations for the crop according to Raij et al.
(1996).  Sunflower and triticale were not fertilized and
the cover crops (in spring) received 40 kg ha-1 N as
urea at planting.

Undisturbed soil samples were collected with
volumetric rings (height 5.0 cm, internal diameter
4.8 cm), and 16 samples were taken per plot (8 from
the center of the 0–20 cm and 8 from the center of the
20–40 cm layer) before starting the experiment to
characterize the area, and after desiccating the cover
crops in the first and third year of the experiment
(just before soybean planting).

The LLWR was determined as described by Silva
et al. (1994).  The least limiting water range limits
were associated to critical soil volumetric water
content (?) defined by the matric potential, soil
penetration resistance, and air-filled porosity as
follows: the soil water retention at field capacity (?FC),
calculated at -0.01 MPa matric potential, the soil water
retention at permanent wilting point (?PWP), -1.5 MPa
matric potential, the soil water content (?SR) at which
penetration resistance reaches 2.0 MPa, and the soil
water content when the air-filled porosity (?AFP) equals
10 %.

In the laboratory, all samples were, at first, water-
saturated (Embrapa, 1997) and submitted to the
following tensions: 0.002, 0.004, 0.006, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1,
0.5, and 1.5 MPa.  A tension table was used to obtain
matric potentials (?) of -0.002, -0.004 and -0.006 MPa.
For ? of -0.01, -0.033, -0.1, -0.5, and -1.5 MPa samples
were placed on a porous plate apparatus.  When the
samples reached equilibrium, penetration resistance
was determined and samples were oven-dried at 105 °C
for 24 h to determine gravimetric moisture and soil
bulk density (Embrapa, 1997).  The penetrograph
(Marconi-model MA 933) consisted of a 6 mm
diameter metal rod with a 30° half-angle conical tip
and base area of 0.1256 cm² attached to a charge cell
held by a mechanical arm driven by a cork screw-like
axle.  The vertical displacement speed of the rod was
1.0 cm min-1 to the depth of 4.0 cm.  Data obtained
from the sample surface to 1.0 cm deep were discarded,
as recommended by Tormena et al. (1998).  The
volumetric moisture (?) was obtained by multiplying
gravimetric moisture by soil bulk density.  The ?FC
and ?PWP values were determined using equation 1
(Silva et al., 1994).

? = exp (a + b Db) ?c (1)

where ? = volumetric water content (m3 m-3); Db =
bulk density (g cm-3); ? = matric potential (MPa); a,
b, c = calibration coefficients.

The critical value of volumetric moisture below
which SR is greater than 2.0 MPa (?SR) was obtained
by the functional relationship between SR, ? and Db
as in equation 2.

SR = d?e Dbf (2)

where SR = Soil penetration resistance (MPa); ? =
volumetric water content of the sample (m3 m-3); Db =
soil bulk density (g cm-3); d, e, f = calibration coefficients.

Finally the ?PA was obtained by equation 3.

?AFP = ?SAT – 0.1 (3)

where ?AFP = soil water content where aeration
porosity is equal to 10 % (0.1 m3 m-3); ?SAT = (1-Db/
2.65), and Db is the soil bulk density value (g cm-3)
and 2.65 (g cm-3) is the assumed value of the mean
particle density.

Thus, the upper limit (UL) of the LLWR is
determined by the lower value of either ?FC or ?AFP,
the lower limit (LL) of the LLWR equals the higher
value of either ?SR or ?PWP, and LLWR is calculated
as LLWR = UL – LL.  After calculating the upper
and lower LLWR limits, the critical soil bulk density
(Dbc) was determined, i.e., the soil density at which
LLWR equals zero, (Silva et al., 1994).

The statistical software Sigma Plot 8.0 was used
to fit equations 1 and 2 and calculate the coefficients
a, b, c, d, e, f (considered significant when p &amp;lt;0.05)
with individual data fit for each treatment and depth.
The upper and lower LLWR limits as a function of
soil bulk density were determined using a XML-based
electronic spreadsheet, as described by Leão &amp;amp; Silva
(2004).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The determination coefficients of equations 1 and
2 had significant F values with p &amp;lt;0.01 (Tables 2 and
3).  In the first year of the experiment, differences in
LLWR were small in all treatments and both soil
layers (Figures 1 and 2) because the lower soil water
content limit was very close to the upper limit in all
samples.  Chiseling led to a higher LLWR amplitude
in the 0–20 cm layer (Figure 1d,h), which was not
observed for the 20–40 cm layer (Figure 2d,h).
According to Carter et al. (1999), the LLWR in NT is
lower than in conventional tillage because SR reaches
2.0 MPa at higher moisture contents in the former
system, due to the higher Db usually found in the
conservation system.  Betz et al. (1998) and Cavalieri
et al. (2006) also observed greater LLWR in soil under
conventional tillage and chiseling, resulting in a
favorable physical environment for root growth.
Regardless of soil depth, the water content bringing
SR to 2 MPa (?RP) equaled the lower LLWR limit in
all samples, and was higher than ?PWP irrespective
of Db in the first year.  This result is typical of
compacted soils that require high moisture to keep
SR below the limiting value (Topp et al., 1994; Silva
et al., 1994; Muller, 2002; Beutler et al., 2006).

In all treatments and soil layers the available
water content (AW = ?FC–?PWP) was higher than
LLWR in the first year of the experiment, which is
typical of degraded soils (Letey, 1985).  For this reason,
Silva et al. (1994) suggested the LLWR as a more
sensitive tool for soil structure analyses.  According

to Topp et al. (1994), the occurrence of very low, or
even zero LLWR values is common in soils with heavy
clay texture, as in this study (Table 1), which
increases the probability of physical limitations for
root growth (Kay, 1990).  Tormena et al. (1998), when
determining the LLWR in a Red Latosol with

800 g kg-1 clay, observed that the ?SR was the lower
limit of soil available water, with Db &gt; 1.10 g cm-3
and soil moisture over 0.24 cm cm-3.  This was not
observed in the present experiment because in most
treatments the lowest Db was higher than 1.10 g cm-3
and ?SR higher than 0.34 g cm-3, especially in the 20–
40 cm layer, which contains more clay.  Even in the
chiseled treatments (Figure 1d,h), where the lowest
Db were 1.05 and 1.06 g cm-3 under sunflower +

chiseling and triticale + chiseling, respectively, the
?SR represented the lower LLWR limit.  Thus, it can
be inferred that shortly after chiseling, this
management was not efficient in increasing the LLWR
to reach the values similar to those reported in the
literature by Tormena et al.(1998), because at the same
Db (of around 1.10 g cm-3) the ?SR was much higher,
that is, 0.35 g cm-3.  However, after growing cover
crops with vigorous, aggressive root systems under

NT the limiting SR for plant growth may be higher
than under conventional systems.  This is possible
because when roots die they leave biopores within the
soil profile allowing new root growth in depth (Silva
&amp;amp; Rosolem, 2001b).

Regarding the upper limit of LLWR, the ?FC was
the maximum limit of soil water in all samples.
Exceptions were the chiseling treatments in the 0–
20 cm layer, where ?AFP represented the upper limit
of LLWR at Db values higher than 1.28 and
1.27 g cm-3 under sunflower and triticale, respectively.
At these Db values the moisture for 10 % air-filled
porosity (AFP) was approximately 0.42 cm cm-3.  The
?AFP was the upper LLWR limit in 9 and 25 %,
respectively, of the samples within the LLWR in the
chiseled plots with triticale and sunflower as fall-winter
crops.  The replacement of ?FC by the ?AFP as the upper
limit of IHO is common in clayey soils, due to the low
soil macroporosity, as in this study (Table 1).
Tormena et al. (1998) obtained similar results in a
clayey soil, that is, the ?AFP became the upper LLWR
limit, substituting the ?FC, with Db of 1.28 g cm-3,
with a soil volumetric moisture of around 0.42 cm cm-3.
However, Pereira et al. (2010) did not observe ?AFP as
the upper limit of LLWR for all Db values obtained,
due to a high sand content (642 g kg-1).

In the two chiseled treatments with sunflower or
triticale in the fall-winter (Figure 1d,h), the Dbc were
the highest in the first year, 1.31 and 1.33 g cm-3
respectively.  This occurs due the large number of
soil fractures, helping to maintain the pre-established
condition of SR at 2.0 MPa, even with the increase of
Db, increasing the Dbc.  These Dbc values were similar
to those reported by Müller (2002) in a Red Nitossol
(Haplortox) with 590 g cm-3 clay in the 10–20 cm layer
(Dbc = 1.33 g cm-3), and higher than the 1.28 g cm-3
Dbc reported by Tormena et al. (1998) in a Red Latossol
with 800 g cm-3 clay in the 0 to 10 cm layer.  Cavalieri
et al. (2006) observed critical Db in treatments with
mechanical management, decreasing the percentage
of samples with Db &gt; Dbc.  For Klein &amp;amp; Câmara
(2007), sporadic sub-soiling in areas under no tillage
result in favorable soil physical conditions for plant
development, specifically by reducing the soil
penetration resistance.

In the 20–40 cm layer LLWR was generally lower
than in the 0–20 cm layer (Figure 2), due to the
restrictive effect of the SR that reached the 2.0 MPa
limit value at high moisture contents, even at the
lowest Db (?SR ? 0.40 cm cm-3).  This effect supports
findings by Tormena et al. (1998) who predicted a
greater impact of SR on LLWR deeper in the soil
profile.  There was no effect of chiseling on LLWR in
this layer, probably because it was the deepest limit
of action of the equipment (20–40 cm layer) and
therefore the de-compaction effect occurred only down
to the tip of each shank.  Araújo et al. (2004) also
observed smaller differences in deeper Db in a
comparison of NT with and without sub-soiling.

In the third year of the experiment, LLWR
increased in the 0–20 cm layer in all treatments
(Figure 3).  However, the lowest LLWR limit was still
represented by ?SR, except under triticale + chiseling
where, at the lowest Db values (1.02 and 1.04 g cm-3),
the LLWR was determined by the available water,
that is, by ?FC and ?PWP, which is typical of a soil
profile that is less restrictive to root development.  In
this layer, chiseling led to the greatest LLWR
amplitude, especially in plots with winter triticale
(Figure 3d,h), where the variation in Db values was
greatest.  The Db values were lowest under sunflower
+ chiseling and triticale + chiseling (1.09 and
1.02 g cm-3, respectively), and Db values high (1.42
and 1.49 g cm-3, respectively), which resulted in a
higher coefficient of variation (7.15 and 10.08 %,
respectively).  Cavalieri et al. (2006) also observed the
effect of mechanical implements on the increase of
dispersion in Db values as soil mobilization increased.

In the 20–40 cm layer the LLWR amplitude was
greater (Figure 4) under rotations involving forage
sorghum (Figure 4b,f) and chiseling (Figure 4d,h).
However, after three seasons, there was an increase
in Dbc in most plots, both in the 0–20 cm (Figure 5a)
and in the 20–40 cm layer (Figure 5b).  The exceptions
were triticale+chiseling in the 0–20 cm layer, where
Dbc remained at 1.33 g cm-3 and sunflower + millet
in the 20–40 cm layer where the LLWR equaled zero.

The highest Dbc was observed in the 0–20 cm layer
after three years of sunflower as fall-winter crop and
sunn hemp as cover crop preceding soybean
(Figure 5a).  This treatment resulted in a Dbc of
1.37 g cm-3, since the increase required in soil
volumetric water content to maintain SR at 2.0 MPa
was low, due to an increase in the Db (Figure 3c).  As
Dbc was very high, 97 % of the samples collected to
determine the LLWR had Db &amp;lt;Dbc (Figure 6a), i.e.,
a reduced probability of occurrence of highly restrictive
conditions to plant growth (Silva &amp;amp; Kay, 1997).

Crop rotation of sunflower and sunn hemp for three
consecutive years resulted in the highest soil organic
matter (SOM) contents in the 0–20 cm layer (Calonego
&amp;amp; Rosolem, 2008), with a beneficial influence on the
soil structure (Mielniczuk, 1999; Zonta et al., 2006)
and consequently on SR reduction.  According to
Sharma &amp;amp; Bhushan (2001), biomass addition to the
soil increases ?AFP and decreases ?SR, resulting in a
higher LLWR.

High frequencies of samples with Db &amp;lt;Dbc were
also observed under triticale + millet and triticale +
sunn hemp (94 and 91 %, respectively) in the 0–20 cm
layer.  Considering the Dbc values as a tool to assess
treatment effects on soil structural quality, it can be
stated that introduction of cover crops in the system
led to higher Dbc increases in the 0–20 cm soil layer,
with values similar to or even higher than those
observed in plots with mechanical intervention
(Figure 5a).  Thus, it can be inferred that biological
sub-soiling, rather than mechanical chiseling, would

result in increasingly favorable soil physical
characteristics in the future, mainly when soil organic
matter is increased.  To increase SOM the system
must include not only grasses, but also legumes, such
as sunn hemp in the present experiment, able to fix
nitrogen.  Moreover, similar results could be expected
in other soils and regions with similar climate,

although the time of response may be different,
depending on the soil texture.  However, a new
chiseling in NT and fallow areas between the fall-
winter and summer crops would be required.  This is
supported by the results presented in figure 6a in the
triticale+chiseling treatment, where the percentage
of samples with Db &amp;lt;Dbc in the 0–20 cm layer,

decreased from 88 to 56 % between the first and third
year of the experiment.  These results explain the
decrease in soybean yield with this mechanical
management, compared with plots under crop rotation
(Calonego &amp;amp; Rosolem, 2010).  In contrast, in the 20–
40 cm layer, although the Dbc values increased in
most treatments with cover crops, the values still

remained lower than in chiseled plots (Figure 5b).  For
this reason, chiseling resulted in the highest frequency
of samples (63 and 69 %) with Db &amp;lt;Dbc (Figure 6),
corroborating results of Cavalieri et al. (2006), who
obtained a sample frequency of 56 % with Db &amp;lt;Dbc
in chiseled soils, against 25 % in treatments without
mechanical intervention, in the 15–30 cm layer.

CONCLUSIONS

1. Chiseling decreases soil bulk density in the 0–
20 cm soil layer, increasing the LLWR magnitude by
lowering the soil water content at which penetration
resistance reaches 2.0 MPa; this effect is measurable
until the third year after chiseling, to a depth of 0.40 m.

2. Crop rotations with sunflower + sunn hemp,
triticale + millet and triticale + sunn hemp for three
years prevented soil bulk density from exceeding the
critical bulk density in the 0–0.20 m layer. However,
this effect is observed to a depth of 0.40 m,after three
years of chiseling and crop rotations involving forage
sorghum.

3. Chiseling and some crop rotations under no
tillage are effective in increasing soil quality as
assessed by the LLWR.
