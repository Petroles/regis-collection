Resumo A terapia fotodinâmica (PhotodynamicTherapy, PDT) é uma metodologia emergente no 

tratamento de diversas doenças oncológicas e tem por base o uso de oxigénio molecular, 

luz e um fotossensibilizador (FS) para seletivamente destruir as células tumorais. Em 

oncologia, a PDT leva à indução de espécies reativas de oxigénio (reactive oxygen species, 

ROS) no tecido tumoral, no qual ocorreu previamente o uptake preferencial e/ou a retenção 

de um FS. 

  As ftalocianinas têm-se vindo a revelar FSs promissores na PDT devido às suas 

propriedades foto-físicas. Contudo, estes compostos para além de pouco solúveis em água, 

têm problemas de agregação e de especificidade para os tecidos tumorais. Assim, o trabalho 

apresentado nesta tese teve como objetivo principal conjugar co-axialmente ftalocianinas 

de silício (silicon phthalocyanines, SiPcs) com duas moléculas de galactose (SiPcGal2) e 

com duas unidades dendríticas de galactose (SiPcGal4) para que estes FSs fossem 

reconhecidos por galectinas (e.g. galectina-1) sobrexpressas em células tumorais. Contudo, 

os compostos desejados finais não foram obtidos, uma vez que a remoção dos grupos 

isopropilideno, protetores dos grupos hidroxilo das unidades de galactose, não foi 

conseguida. Assim, foram avaliadas as propriedades foto-físicas e foto-químicas das SiPcs 

com as galactoses protegidas, comparando com a SiPc dihidróxido (SiPc(OH)2), de forma 

a estudar a influência da conjugação co-axial de biomoléculas no core destes tipo de FSs. 

Infelizmente, a solubilidade das SiPcs em solventes aquosos não foi conseguida, contudo o 

seu espectro de absorção UV-visível evidenciou elevada absorção a altos comprimentos de 

onda (650-700 nm), janela espectrofotométrica onde ocorre uma penetração mais profunda 

da luz nos tecidos. Para além disso, estes FSs demonstraram-se excelentes marcadores 

fluorescentes, estáveis após irradiação e bons geradores de 1O2. Foram ainda realizados 

estudos in vitro com o objetivo de validar o seu potencial fotodinâmico no tratamento do 

cancro da bexiga, sendo que a SiPcGal4 e a SiPcGal2 agregaram nas células, tendo assim 

um baixo uptake, baixa toxicidade após foto-ativação e baixa produção de ROS.  

  No geral, as SiPcs demonstraram um grande potencial como futuros FSs para a PDT, dado 

as suas excelentes propriedades foto-físicas, o que nos incentiva na descoberta de novas 

técnicas que diminuam a sua agregação nas células, como a utilização de bio-formulações 

estáveis e a desproteção das moléculas de galactose, que também irá aumentar a sua 

especificidade para células tumorais.

Abstract Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) relies on the combination of a photosensitizer (PS), light and 

molecular oxygen (O2) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can trigger cell 

death pathways. In oncology, the PS needs to be preferentially accumulated in cancer cells 

and a good generator of ROS (especially singlet oxygen, 1O2).  

Phthalocyanines (Pcs) are promising PSs in PDT due to their photochemical and 

photophysical properties. However, Pcs present solubility and aggregation problems, as well 

as low selectivity to the cancer tissue. Therefore, it will be conjugated a silicon 

phthalocyanine (SiPc) with two galactose molecules (SiPcGal2) and another with two 

galacto-dendritic units (SiPcGal4), both in axial positions. The aim of that conjugation is to 

promote the binding of the PS with galactose-binding proteins such as galectins (e.g. 

galectin-1) which are found to be overexpressed in cancer cells. Nevertheless, the desired 

compound were not obtained, once the hydrolysis of the isopropylidene galactose-protective 

groups didn’t work. Thereby, the photophysical and photochemical properties of those two 

SiPcs with the galactose-protective groups were studied in comparison with the SiPc 

dihydroxide (SiPc(OH)2), in order to study the SiPc core properties as well as the influence 

of an axial conjugation of biomolecules. The PSs solubility was compromised in an aqueous 

solution, however their absorption UV-Visible spectra showed high absorption peaks at a 

high wavelengths range (650–700 nm), which is the ideal therapeutical window where there 

is a higher penetration of light into the tissues. Furthermore, these SiPcs demonstrated to be 

good fluorescence labels, photostable and good 1O2 generators. In vitro studies were 

performed with the aim of validating them as photodynamic therapeutic agents against 

bladder cancer cells, however SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 aggregated on cells, having a low 

uptake, phototoxicity and ROS production. 

Overall, SiPcs have demonstrated a great potential as future PSs for PDT, thanks to their 

excellent photophysical properties, which prompt us in the discovery of different approaches 

that diminished their aggregation on cells, such as the incorporation of PSs into bio-stable 

formulations and the deprotection of the galactose molecules, which will also increase their 

specificity to tumoral cells.

1. Overview 
  

Cancer is a disease caused by an abnormal growth of cells which tend to 

proliferate in an uncontrolled way and, in some cases, to spread out to other organs 

of the body through the blood and lymph systems. This process is named metastasis 

and corresponds to the most advanced stage of cancer and the most common 

cause of cancer death. There are more than 100 different types of cancer. In 2012, 

there were approximately 14 million of new cancer cases and 8.2 million of cancer 

related deaths (1). The most common and conventional cancer treatments are 

surgery, and/or radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy. However, there are serious 

side effects in those treatments, such as loss of normal cell function. In order to 

counter that, less invasive approaches were developed over the years, targeted 

therapies that use drugs to more precisely identify and destroy cancer cells, causing 

far less damage to healthy cells. Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is a newer type of 

therapeutic approach that uses special drugs named photosensitizing agents, along 

with light to induce cancer cell death, through the production of reactive oxygen 

species (ROS). PDT can be applied alone or in combination with the aforementioned 

traditional treatments (2,3). 

The pursuit of new photosensitizing agents for PDT is a lively research field. 

Those drugs should specifically accumulate in cancer tissues and have high 

production of ROS. The conjugation of galactose targeting moieties with a 

porphyrinoid-based drug is a valuable way to achieve a high local concentration of 

that drug in tumor tissues, since certain galectins (i.e. galectin-1 and galectin-3) are 

overexpressed on the target cells relatively to normal tissues (4).

2. Photodynamic therapy 
 

In oncology, PDT is an emerging treatment modality able to treat many forms 

of cancer and other non-neoplastic diseases (5-7), being particularly interesting in 

the tumors that occur in cavities (such as bladder, esophagus or intestine). This 

methodology combines a photosensitizer (PS) with light of appropriate wavelength 

and molecular oxygen (O2). None of these elements are toxic by themselves, 

however when combined they generate ROS that kill malignant cells by triggering a 

cascade of cytotoxic reactions (8). In order to allow that the knowledge of 

photosensitization can be rapidly applied in clinical practice, PDT requires the 

cooperation of chemists (e.g., for synthesis of new PS), biologists (e.g., for testing 

new substances), physicists (e.g., for light dosimetry), and clinicians (e.g., for the 

transfer from the lab bench to the clinical application). 

 

2.1 Brief History 

 

The first clinical use of PDT date back to 1903 when Tappeiner and Jesionek 

combined a topical application of eosin with white light to treat skin tumors, lupus 

and condylomata of female genitalia (9). After ten years, Meyer-Betz found out that 

porphyrins (Pors) act as photosensitizing agents in humans while injecting 200 mg 

of hematoporphyrin (Hp) in himself. (10). However, after sun light exposure there 

were side effects, such as severe pain and swelling confined to the light-exposed 

areas. Around the 1960’s, Schwartz and Lipson described the tumor accumulation 

of Hp derivatives (HpD, a mixture of monomers, dimers and oligomers) as well as 

their use in tumors photodetection (11). Since these pioneering works, several 

compounds have been developed and tested. Among them, there is Photofrin®, the 

first PS approved for clinical PDT in the treatment of superficial bladder cancer in 

Canada and early lung and advanced esophageal cancers in The Netherlands and 

Japan (12). Considering the ideal properties of a PS, that will be explained further 

on detail, a wide range of synthetic or natural PSs have been studied, tested in vivo 

and in vitro, and some of them are currently in advanced stages of clinical trials. 



Introduction

Examples of new PSs are synthetic Pors (13), benzoporphyrins (14), chlorins (15), 

phthalocyanines (Pcs) (16), among others. 

 

2.2 Molecular basis of PDT 

 

Photophysics 

 

PDT is based on the PS administration and after a preferential uptake and/or 

retention period the affected area is irradiated with light to induce photoreactions. 

Upon illumination with light of an appropriate wavelength, PS absorbs a photon 

leading to the formation of an electronically excited singlet state (1PS*). However, 

this short-lived species can lose their energy and restore the ground state by 

emission of fluorescence or by internal conversion (IC, non-radiative transitions 

between two electronic states with the same spin multiplicity) with energy loss as 

heat. The singlet state 1PS*, can also undergo the process known as intersystem 

crossing (ISC), leading to formation of the long-lived triplet excited state (3PS*). The 

energy of 3PS* can be dissipated (leading the PS to its ground state) through two 

main pathways: i) thermal decay, i.e. IC; or ii) by emission of light, namely 

phosphorescence (P). In Figure 1.1 it is represented a modified Jablonski diagram 

that illustrates the electronic states of the PS and the transitions between them. 3PS* 

usually has a lifetime in the microsecond range (typically &gt; 0.5 µs), which is sufficient 

to enable interaction between the excited PS and surrounding biomolecules. 

Moreover, this state can induce cytotoxic effects by PDT through two kinds of 

reactions, defined as Type I and Type II photoreactions (17).

Figure 1.1 Modified Jablonsky energy diagram showing the various modes of excitation 

and relaxation occurring in PSs: excitation (E), internal conversion (IC), fluorescence (F), 

phosphorescence (P), intersystem crossing (ISC). Type I and Type II photoreactions are 

also represented. 

 

 

Photochemistry 

 

Type I photoreactions can proceed by an electron (and/or proton) transfer 

process, hence causing a direct interaction of 3PS* with the cellular substrate (lipids, 

proteins, nucleic acids, etc.) leading to generation of radicals. Subsequent reaction 

with O2 forms ROS, such as the superoxide anion (O2·?), the hydroxyl radical (OH·), 

and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) that initiate radical chain reactions (18,19).  

Alternatively, Type II photoreactions proceed by energy transfer, where the 

interaction of O2 in its ground triplet state (3O2) with 3PS* generates a more reactive 

form of oxygen, i.e. singlet oxygen (1O2). This non-radical species are highly reactive 

towards electrons rich substrates such as for instance, double bonds, aromatic 

rings, amines and thioethers (18,19). They also react with plasmatic membrane 

biomolecules and different cellular organelles, leading to the selective destruction 

of the target cells by necrosis and/or apoptosis and/or autophagy-associated cell 

death, without damaging the healthy tissue (Figure 1.1). Antitumor effects of PDT 

derive from three inter-related mechanisms: direct cytotoxic effects on tumor cells, 

damage to the tumor vasculature and induction of a robust inflammatory reaction 

that can lead to the development of systemic immunity (3). The role of 1O2 in the 

photodynamic effect is controversial between researchers. However, for most PSs

currently under investigation, the 1O2-mediated photodynamic mechanism is the 

model of cytotoxic action usually accepted (20). To investigate the chemistry of 1O2, 

several analytical tools can be used such as spectrophotometry, fluorimetry, and 

chemiluminometry. In spectrophotometry, 1O2 react rapidly and irreversibly with a 

probe (e.g. diphenylisobenzofuran, DPBF) to initially yield an endoperoxide which, 

in turn, emerge into other products that do not fluoresce and have absorption 

spectra different from that of the probe (21). The use of selective and photo-

activated PS makes PDT a promising technique for the treatment of a variety of 

oncological diseases. 

 

3. Photosensitizers 

 

A PS, which is a molecule that enters an excited state when exposed to light 

of a specific wavelength, can use that energy to induce cytotoxic reactions leading 

to cell death and tissue destruction. Thus, a good PS agent with potentially optimal 

properties for PDT should be endowed with specific features: i) single pure 

compound; ii) low manufacturing costs and good stability in storage; iii) no dark 

toxicity, but being toxic upon photo-activation; iv) rapid clearance from normal 

tissues to minimize phototoxic side effects; v) high triplet-state quantum yields, i.e., 

triplet-state with lifetimes enough and sufficiently energetic to produce 1O2 and vi) 

high absorption peak between 600 and 800 nm (therapeutic window). This last 

characteristic is related to the aforementioned light penetration into the tissues once 

in this range the light wavelengths are still energetic enough to produce 1O2 and 

tissues are more transparent, thus light has its maximum depth of penetration 

(Figure 1.2). Absorption bands at shorter wavelengths than 600 nm have less tissue 

penetration due to the endogenous absorption by tissue cromophores (e.g. oxy-

/deoxy- hemoglobin, melanin), leading to skin photosensitivity. At wavelengths 

higher than 800 nm there is not enough energy for the 3PS* transfer to the ground 

state of O2 in order to excite it to the singlet state (20).

Although many PSs, such as methylene blue (3,7-bis(dimethylamino)-

phenothiazin-5-ium chloride, MB), rose bengal (4,5,6,7-tetrachloro-2',4',5',7'-

tetraiodofluorescein) and acridine (2,3-benzoquinoline) are known to be efficient 1O2 

generators, the vast majority that are successful as PDT agents are based upon the 

tetrapyrrole chromophore (22). Tetrapyrroles usually have a large absorption band 

in the region of 400 nm known as the Soret band, and a set of absorption bands as 

the spectrum gets closer to red wavelengths – known as Q bands (23). 

The evaluation of physicochemical properties of a new PS can be performed 

by spectroscopic techniques and in vitro studies can be used to highlight specific 

applications. Additionally, it is important to screen the absorption, distribution, 

metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties in order to avoid the clinical failure of 

drug candidates. According to a survey by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 

1991, approximately 40 % of clinical failure was due to poor pharmacokinetics (PK) 

properties (24). Then, pharmaceutical companies began assessing those properties 

of new chemical entities at the very early stages of drug discovery (25). Several 

techniques can be used for this screening, such as in vitro optimization to 

understand the specific factors that contribute to the drug disposition, and in vivo 

methods that provide more integrated means for optimizing ADME properties (26).

Starting with the administration, there are three possible routes: enteral route 

(oral, where the effect is systemic and the substance is given via the digestive tract), 

parenteral route (the effect is also systemic but the substance is given by routes 

other than the digestive tract) and topical (the substance is applied directly where 

its action is desired and the effect is local). Parenteral administration routes include 

several injections types: intravenous (IV), subcutaneous (SC), intradermal and 

intramuscular (IM). Many factors affect the drug distribution (i.e. its transport from 

the point of administration or absorption to the site of action), such as the vascular 

permeability, regional blood flow, cardiac output, perfusion rate of the tissue and the 

binding ability of the drug to plasma proteins. The lipophilic drug properties that are 

desirable to its uptake into the biological membranes of its effector site are 

prejudicial to its elimination of the body. That is why it needs to be metabolized into 

more hydrophilic metabolites that will be able to pass the renal tubes without being 

reabsorbed. This metabolic process occurs mainly in the liver, but also in the blood, 

brain, lung and kidneys. After that, the drug is excreted (renal or biliary; minor: 

exhalation, sweat) and eliminated from the body (27). Figure 1.3 resumes the drug 

route from its administration into the body till its excretion.

First and second generations PSs 

 

The first family of PSs is represented by a purified version of HpD, named 

Photofrin® (Figure 1.4) (29). This was the first PS approved for the treatment of 

early-stage and advanced lung cancers, superficial gastric cancer, esophageal 

adenocarcinoma, cervical cancer and bladder cancer (BC), in 1993, in Canada. This 

PS has an absorption spectrum characteristic of Pors with five peaks (one stronger 

band – Soret band – and four Q bands). However, Photofrin® is not a pure 

compound and shows low specificity for the cancer tissue leading to cytotoxic 

damage in the healthy one like an intense inflammatory and necrotic reaction at the 

treated site (23). Additionally, it has a low maximum wave absorption band (630 

nm), which only allows biological effects at a tissue depth of around 5 mm, after 

irradiation. Moreover, these sensitizers take 2-3 months to clear from the cutaneous 

tissues which requires that during this period of time the patients are required to 

avoid bright light (30). 

 

Figure 1.4. Photofrin® structure. 

 

The second generation PSs include, among others, Por derivatives, chlorins 

and Pcs (e.g. Levulan®, Foscan® and silicon(IV) phthalocyanine (Pc4)). They have 

high ROS production and strong absorption in the required wavelength range (600-

850 nm), which allows phototherapy in deep regions, leading to a better efficacy of 

PDT. Kennedy et al demonstrated the clinical suitability of ?-aminolevulinic acid 

(ALA) (31). Bladder tissue can be photosensitized by instillation of ALA, a prodrug 

that is able to initiate a series of biochemical reactions that result in significant

accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) or photoactive porphyrins (PAPs) that 

preferentially accumulate in malignant and pre-cancerous tissue rather than in 

benign cells. However, ALA is an hydrophilic compound and cannot therefore 

penetrate all tissue, resulting in some clinical limitations, such as a long swelling 

time and a variable PpIX fluorescence intensity and distribution (32). Chlorins are 

tetrapyrroles with one pyrrole ring reduced. This feature leads to a higher 

wavelength absorption band in the region of 650-690 nm which is desirable for PDT 

(15). Pcs are Por synthetic analogues with excellent photophysical and chemical 

properties, that together with their chemical versatility, make this class of 

compounds promising candidates for PDT applications (30). Some of the first and 

second generation PSs that already are under clinical trial or in clinical use are 

summarized in Table 1.1.

Third generation PSs 

  

The third generation PSs is generated by the coupling of the first or second 

generation PSs with a targeting component that is specifically recognized by the 

cancer cell and allows a selective delivery and uptake (30). Pors and their 

derivatives have been conjugated with many proteins, such as human and bovine 

serum albumin (HSA and BSA, respectively) (33), monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 

(34) and amino acids (35), among others. Alternatively, carbohydrates, that are able 

to target carbohydrate binding proteins overexpressed in tumoral cells, are also 

being explored as potential targeting components (36). 

In our research group, at the University of Aveiro, several Por 

glycoconjugates have been developed with very promising results for BC treatment 

and for antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, after PDT (37-

40). The glycoconjugates have demonstrated promising in vitro results and are 

currently being tested in vivo. Some examples of third generation PSs are 

represented in Table 1.2.

4. Phthalocyanines 
 

Pcs have been widely studied due to their potentiality to be used in medicine 

and supramolecular chemistry (46). In this section their structural and photophysical 

properties, the synthetic strategies and their role as PS agents will be highlighted. 

 

Structure and properties 

 

Pcs are two-dimensional synthetic tetrapyrrolic compounds constituted by 

four isoindole units presenting an 18 ?-electron system, which is delocalized over 

an arrangement of alternated carbon and nitrogen atoms. They present a strong 

absorption band in the red region of the spectrum (630 to 750 nm) mainly in the 

near-infrared (IR) region (Figure 1.5) which confers a bright green/blue color that 

have a great interest in using Pcs as dyes in pigments industries (47).

These compounds are able to form stable metallocomplexes with many metal 

cations (e.g. zinc (Zn), silicon (Si) and ruthenium (Ru)) using the four central pyrrole 

nitrogens of the macrocycle (48). The hydrogen atoms of the central cavity can be 

replaced by more than 70 elements and the coordination number of the square-

planar Pc is four. Thus, according to its size and oxidation state, the metal can be 

inserted into the Pc core. When the metal has a higher coordination number, 

pyramidal, tetrahedral or octahedral structures result with one or two axial ligands 

(46). The internal and external positions of the fused benzene ring are also 

commonly known as ?- and ?-positions, respectively (Figure 1.6). The chemical

versatility of this class of macrocycles allows the tuning of their physicochemical 

properties, making Pcs promising PS agents for PDT in the treatment of cancer (49). 

 

                

Figure 1.6. Structures of MPc- and metal-free-Pcs (H2Pc). 

 

Synthetic routes 

 

The synthesis of Pcs can be carried out either by cyclotetramerization of the 

appropriately substituted precursors, usually phthalonitriles (Scheme 1.1) or 

diiminoisoindolines. Most often, this reaction is conducted in the presence of metal 

ions that act as template during the ring formation. Not only the metal-template 

effect, but also the thermodynamic stabilization and the aromaticity involved on the 

Pc macrocycle formation, are responsible for the ring closure (50).  

 

 

Scheme 1.1. Schematic representation of the synthesis of a MPc using a phthalonitrile as 

precursor in the presence of metal ions (M). 

 

Owing to their extended conjugation, Pcs exhibit a high aggregation 

tendency, by ?-? interactions and reduction of solubility, that reduce their ADME 

properties and compromise their photophysical characteristics (i.e. ability to 

generate 1O2 and other related ROS). To overcome such limitations, a wide variety

of substituents can be introduced either axially or at the periphery of the macrocycle. 

(47). Due to their promising studies for biological applications, Pcs coordinated 

centrally with a Si atom will be explored in this dissertation. 

 

4.1 Silicon Phthalocyanines 

 

An important feature of silicon phthalocyanines (SiPcs) is their four-

coordinate central atom that allows many structural possibilities and thus a flexibility 

of the synthetic design, such as the functionalization of two axial ligands (51). The 

axial functionalization reduces aggregation, increasing the solubility in a variety of 

solvents, photosensitizing efficiency as well as fine-tune fluorescence and triplet 

state characteristics (52). The first approved SiPc conjugated with axial ligands was 

Pc4 (53-55). This PS showed excellent results both in vitro and in vivo and presently 

are being made the clinical trials for the treatment of cutaneous neoplasms (56). 

Pc4 contains two axial ligands consisting of a hydroxyl and a dimethylamino-

propylsiloxy group (Figure 1.7) and has an absorption band in the therapeutic 

window (670 nm) (57). This PS demonstrated excellent cellular uptake and 

photodynamic efficacy as well as effectiveness in eliminating human 

immunodeficiency virus-infected cells (58). 

 

 

Figure 1.7. Pc4 chemical structure. 

 

Many others axial conjugated SiPcs are being developed and tested in vitro, 

and will be highlighted the ones conjugated with biomolecules, such as proteins 

(59,60), nucleosides (61), carbohydrates (45, 62-64) and mAb (34) (Table 1.3).

4.2 Phthalocyanines galacto-dendritic conjugates 

 

Pc’s tendency of aggregation due to their low solubility in many solvent 

systems is being a challenge in the development of effective Pc formulations. 

Aggregation of the macrocycle leads to quenching of the 3PS*, decreasing the yield 

of triplet state and hence the efficiency of the compound as a PS (46). In order to 

minimize these problems, the development of new Pcs linked to biochemical motifs 

have been developed. 

Carbohydrates are potential candidates as PS-delivery systems because 

they are biocompatible molecules with a rapid cellular uptake and with a specific 

recognition by lectin proteins (36). Lectins’ hydroxyl groups make the sugars suited 

for directional acceptor/donor hydrogen bonds (65). It is expected that the specific 

(non-covalent) binding of carbohydrates with lectins promotes the accumulation of 

the glycoconjugate inside cells by the endocytic pathway (66). Furthermore, certain 

carbohydrate-binding lectins are overexpressed in tumor cells (67). Therefore, 

galactose molecules have been conjugated with PSs, since they can be recognized 

by galactose-binding proteins overexpressed in cancer cells (namely galectin-1 and 

-3) (68). Galectins are small soluble proteins (molecular weight 14-35 kDa) with 

carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) which are responsible for the specific and 

individual binding of each galectin to carbohydrates (69). Particularizing to galectin-

1, this protein exhibits dual localization, being found in both intracellular (nucleus 

and cytoplasm) and extracellular (cell surface and medium) compartments (70). 

Intracellularly, it is involved in fundamental processes such as pre-mRNA (precursor 

messenger ribonucleic acid) splicing and on the regulation of intracellular signaling 

pathways (e.g. mitosis, apoptosis and cell-cycle progression) after binding 

intracellular ligands. Extracellularly, it can bind to cell-surface glycoconjugates that 

contain suitable galactose-containing oligosaccharides (71). Therefore, the coupling 

of a Pc with galactose moieties can provide a distinct advantage for the efficacious 

targeting of the PS to cancer cells due to the presence of galactose-binding proteins 

that are overexpressed in those cells, and that can facilitate the PS cellular uptake 

(Figure 1.8). 

 

Figure 1.8. Possible interaction of a SiPc conjugated with two galactose molecules with 

galactose binding proteins overexpressed in cancer cells. 

 

 

Many PSs conjugated with carbohydrates showed promising in vitro results 

and are currently being tested in vivo. Maillard reported the synthesis of a 

glycoconjugated chlorin (42). Fujimoto has conjugated a Por with galactose and its 

molecular delivery to hepatocytes (43). Silva reported the synthesis of a Pc 

containing eight dendritic units of galactose (72) which is able to target and kill BC 

cells through mediated interaction with galactose-binding proteins overexpressed in 

those cells (40). Particularizing to SiPcs, there are only few reports of their axial 

conjugation to carbohydrates. Ng and co-workers reported the conjugation of 

unsymmetrical SiPcs with a ?-cyclodextrin (62), of two SiPcs with acetal-protected 

glucose molecules (63) and also a SiPc with one or two axial acetal-protected

galactose substituent(s) (Table 1.3) (45). The in vitro and in vivo results showed a 

high photodynamic activity of these compounds against HepG2 human 

hepatocellular carcinoma, which can be attributed to the high cellular uptake and 

efficiency to generate 1O2, as well as tumor growth retardation. These compounds 

are therefore promising PSs for PDT. However, there are no reports related with the 

synthesis and validation of SiPcs conjugation with deprotected sugar substituents. 

Recently, the emerging role of dendrimers in biological systems has 

highlighted their potential benefits for the preparation of new anticancer drugs. 

Dendrimers are highly branched nanostructures with many arms emanating from a 

central core (73). Besides improving the biocompatibility and the photochemical 

proprieties of PSs, they also create multivalent interactions with more than one 

receptor binding site, contributing to an active cancer cell targeting, improving 

cellular recognition (Figure 1.9). Additionally, they act as nanocarriers, leading to 

the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect that is characteristic of tumor 

tissues (37). Several PSs (Por and Pc) conjugated with galacto-dendritic units have 

been synthesized and tested in vitro in BC cells with very promising results (40,72). 

However, there are no reports of the axial conjugation of Pcs with galacto-dendritic 

units.

5. Photodynamic therapy in clinical applications 

 

PDT has been mostly restricted to the treatment of melanomas and solid 

tumors occurring in externally accessible cavities, like the bladder and the 

esophagus (3). PS can be administrated intravenously or topically and then it should 

be preferentially accumulated in the desired tissue (Figure 1.10). After a 

predetermined time, known as the drug-to-light interval, light is directly applied into 

the tumor by the use of modern fiber-optic systems and various types of endoscopy, 

which allows an accurately light targeting to almost any part of the body (74). The 

period of time between PS administration and the start of illumination varies 

between 5 min to 24 h, or more. The most efficient light systems are lasers and light 

emitting diodes (LEDs) sources with relatively narrow spectral bandwidths and high 

fluence rates. Lasers can also be coupled into fibers with diffusing tips to treat 

tumors in the urinary bladder and the digestive tract (3). 

1O2 generated by the activated PS is believed to be responsible for tumor 

destruction (75). Once 1O2 has a very short lifetime, it is deactivated before it can 

escape from the cell in which it was produced. Photobleaching can be an advantage 

avoiding an overall skin photosensitivity which is one of the main side effects in 

patients treated with PDT. Total healing of the area after PDT may take from 2 to 6 

weeks. During this time, the patient will be light sensitive (due to PS accumulation 

in the skin) and must be protected from direct light (3).

Introduction

In order to improve the therapeutic index of treatments in modern oncology, 

many therapeutic modalities with non-overlapping toxicities can be combined. There 

are two general approaches that may increase the antitumor effectiveness of PDT, 

mostly in elderly or debilitated patients who less tolerate more intensive therapeutic 

regimes, such as: i) sensitization of tumor cells to PDT (77) and ii) interference with 

cytoprotective molecular responses triggered by PDT in surviving tumor or stromal 

cells. Therefore, any interactions between PDT and PSs will be confined to the 

irradiated area (3). Despite all its applications, PDT has the limitation that cannot 

cure advanced disseminated diseases because it requires irradiation of the whole 

body with appropriate doses and that is not possible with the present technologies. 

However, for advanced diseases, PDT can improve quality of life and lengthen 

survival of the patients (74). For early or localized diseases, this technique can be 

a selective and curative therapy with many potential advantages over available 

alternatives. 

 

5.1 Bladder Cancer 

 

BC is a disease that affects many patients worldwide. It has a high rate of 

mortality and recurrence (78). Nowadays, many advances have been attempted to 

understand the nature of this disease and to develop new treatment approaches 

(79). In this section, the focus is on BC physiopathology, incidence and treatment. 

 

Physiopathology 

 

Bladder is a hollow, balloon shaped organ in the pelvic floor containing three 

histological layers: 1) urothelium, 2) lamina propria (suburothelial loose connective 

tissue) and 3) detrusor or muscularis propria. After muscularis propria there is a 

perivesical fat that covers the superior surface and the upper part separating the 

bladder from the nearby organs (Figure 1.11) (80,81). Urothelium is a highly 

specialized transitional epithelium layer that creates an interface between 

pathogens and other bladder tissues through many defense mechanisms. Its cell 



Introduction 

 

21 

 

turnover is very slow, but capable of a very rapid proliferation in response to injury 

(82).  

BC progression is based on four stages that depend on the location of the 

tumor in the bladder layers. The tumor grows from the inside of the bladder wall 

(stage 0) and can spread into the lamina propria layer (stage I), then into the 

muscular layer (stage II), penetrate the perivesical tissues (stage III) and finally 

invade other organs (stage IV): prostate, uterus, vagina, abdominal wall and pelvic 

wall (Figure 1.11). Stages 0 and I are superficial or non muscle-invasive while 

stages II, III and IV are muscle-invasive cancers. When the cancer extends from its 

original place (in the bladder) to another part of the body (stage IV) it is named 

metastatic BC (79). The classification of BC staging comes from the Tumor-Node-

Metastases (TNM) system which is based on the size and penetration of the tumor 

on the tissues of the bladder (Table 1.4) (81).

The staging process is a major factor in treatment choice. BC is a pathology 

that frequently does not have symptoms associated. However, when it does, the 

most common ones are painless hematuria, that can be detected by a chemical 

reagent strip for hemoglobin and spun sediment microscopy on voided urine, and 

irritative symptoms such as frequency, urgency and pain. Normally, screening is 

performed by combining different modalities: the surgical procedure transurethral 

resection (TUR), bimanual palpation before and after TUR, fluorescence 

cystoscopy, radiological imaging techniques and histopathological examination 

(79). 

The non muscle-invasive BC (Ta (70%) and T1 (20%), Table 1.4) is the most 

frequently diagnosed. Its progression to muscle-invasive BC and rate of recurrence 

depends on the tumor grade, stage and size, the presence of CIS (Table 1.4), the 

occurrence of multifocal lesions and the prior recurrence. Ta tumors rarely become 

muscle-invasive, but high grade T1 tumors and flat CIS lesions (Table 1.4) have an 

increased propensity to progress. Although CIS belongs to the non muscle-invasive 



Introduction 

 

23 

 

(10%) BC group, it is associated to a higher aggressiveness due to molecular 

alterations that are characteristic of muscle-invasive BC (84). 

 

Statistics 

 

BC is the 9th most common cancer worldwide. The age standardized rate 

(ASR) is 10.1 per 100,000 for males and 2.5 per 100,000 for females. More than 12 

million of new cancer cases occur annually worldwide, of those 5.4 million occur in 

developed countries and 6.7 million in developing countries (78). In Europe, 

mortality rates increased in Southern and Eastern Europe between the mid-1950s 

and late 1980s, but a decline has been observed in several Northern European 

countries over the last two decades (79). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 1.12. Most frequent cancers in Europe (2012). The values correspond to estimated 

incidence (left) and mortality (right) in both males and females (85). 

 

 

Predisposition factors include smoking, exposure to aromatic amines and 

inorganic chemicals in the workplace, chronic cystitis associated with foreign bodies, 

pelvic radiation therapy, exposure to the chemotherapeutic prodrug 

cyclophosphamide (79) and parasitic infections (86) in the Middle East and parts of 

Africa where schistosomiasis is a widespread problem. Most bladder carcinogens 

exert their action by direct contact with the bladder epithelium. Inhaled or ingested 

compounds that are either directly carcinogenic or that can be transformed by the 

body in carcinogenic byproducts, reach the urinary bladder because they are 

excreted via the urine. Patients that had BC histories for recurrence need to be

screened annually by cytological examination of exfoliated cells in both voided urine 

and saline bladder lavage specimens (79). 

 

Treatment 

 

BC treatment depends on the grade, stage and whether the lesion is flat or 

papillary (87). The most applied surgical procedure is TUR that can be used to 

diagnose, stage, and treat the majority of primary and recurrent bladder tumors. This 

treatment has three main goals: i) to provide pathologic material to determine the 

histologic type and grade of bladder tumor; ii) to determine the presence, depth and 

type of tumor invasion; and iii) to remove all visible and microscopic superficial and 

invasive tumor(s) (88). If there are multiple recurrences, the patient is given a topical 

immunotherapy that consists in intravesical instillations of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin 

(BCG). This therapy is only applied in non muscle-invasive BC with no side effects 

and is an easy deliver in bladder due to its great accessibility (89). However, this 

treatment fails in 30-40% of patients, and 30-40% of those had an initial response 

that relapsed due to intolerance, recurrence and resistance of patients to BCG (90). 

In more advanced stages of the tumor, radiotherapy, radical cystectomy and 

chemotherapy are the therapeutics of choice (91,92). Though, these conventional 

therapies might cause unwanted side effects and in some cases they are not 

completely effective in the destruction of the tumor, leading to a high risk of 

recurrence and progression. Thus, in order to preserve the bladder and its function, 

there is a clinical interest on using alternative treatments. 

The clinical urological interest in PDT is focused on the preservation of the 

organ and its function because there are no significant changes in tissue 

temperature, and the preservation of connective tissue leads to minimal fibrosis. 

Current scientific research on PDT for BC treatment is based on the development 

of tumor selective drugs (33, 40, 93). BCs are suitable targets for PDT because their 

interior can be assessed by endoscopy. The bladder geometry should allow an 

improved and homogeneous light delivery and the bladder tissue is relatively more 

translucent when compared to other human tissues (3). The first PS used to treat 

recurrent BC was HpD, in 1975 (94). After this, in 1993, Photofrin® was approved in

Canada. However, both PSs could only be used for superficial BC, once for whole-

bladder PDT, there was a high incidence of side effects, such as urinary frequency, 

pain and persistent reduction in bladder capacity (23, 95, 96). These complications 

were due to the excessive light doses and the non-uniform light delivery in the early 

studies. Nseyo et al showed that, for standardized protocols, reducing the drug and 

light dose and decreasing the light penetration in tissues to wavelengths of 514 nm 

(green light), also gives a good tumor response rate for superficial lesions without 

transmural bladder wall injury or treatment-related morbidity (97). This became an 

excellent treatment option of CIS, although it was not been fully evaluated. Another 

PS that has been used for recurrent superficial bladder cancer is Levulan® by given 

a single PDT treatment or in combination with mitomycin C, which resulted in a 

complete response rates at 18-24 months without persistent reduction in bladder 

capacity (98-101). Finally, as mentioned before, various therapeutic modalities with 

non-overlapping toxicities could also be combined. Pan et al (102) hypothesized that 

PDT combined with intravesical BCG would form an auto-vaccine for BC. Tumor 

cells treated in vitro by PDT can be used to generate potent cancer vaccines. 

Hypothetically, tumor cells destroyed by PDT could be treated with BCG to elicit and 

amplify the immunological response, which would lead to the formation of an in-situ 

auto-vaccine against urothelial tumor cells, whether local or systemic.

6. Objectives and working plan 

 

The necessity of finding new approaches for cancer treatment in order to 

preserve the quality of life of the patient by reducing side effects has been 

captivating the attention of many research groups. Being PDT a less invasive 

therapy that selectively attack the cancer cells, the goal is to find ideal PSs suitable 

for many types of cancers. BC is a good target for PDT due to its geometry that 

allows an endoscopy access.  

An ideal PS is not always easy to find because it should be endowed with 

specific features as described above (page 7). The development of Pcs for PDT has 

been especially promising due to their unique photochemical properties. However, 

Pcs have reduced water solubility and low specificity to the cancer tissue. Therefore, 

the aims of this Master’s dissertation were to synthesize water soluble SiPcs 

conjugated with galacto-dendritic units that will increase the specificity to tumoral 

cells, to study their photophysical and photochemical properties, and to validate 

them as photodynamic therapeutic agent against BC cells.  

 

Working Plan 
 

- Synthesis of novel water soluble galacto-conjugated SiPcs; 

- Study of their photophysical and photochemical properties: 

o Solubility in DMSO, DMF (Dimethylformamide) and PBS (Phosphate 

buffered saline); 

o Fluorescence emission spectrum in DMF; 

o Photostability when irradiated with red light; 

o Generation of 1O2 using DPBF as 1O2 scavenger; 

- Validate their photodynamic potential against a human bladder cancer cell 

line, UM-UC-3, with high levels of galectin-1: 

o Determine the uptake of the galacto-conjugates by BC; 

o Quantify the levels of ROS after PSs-PDT; 

o Determine the toxicity in darkness (MTT assay); 

o Determine the phototoxicity after light activation (MTT assay);

1. Novel galacto-conjugated silicon phthalocyanines: synthesis 

and characterization 

 

1.1 Overview 

 

Nowadays, PDT research is focused on the development of new PSs with 

improved photophysical and photobiological properties (3). Pcs derivatives have 

high absorption in the visible region of the spectrum (around 650 nm), allowing much 

deeper tissue penetration for therapy. These PSs present a long lifetime of the triplet 

excited state which will induce high production of 1O2 (49). Based on these 

properties, Pcs have emerged as a promising class of PSs (103). However, the 

major problem is their insolubility in physiological fluids due to their hydrophobic 

skeletons, which leads to Pcs aggregation, affecting their photophysical properties. 

Additionally, the Pcs’ core has not specificity for cancer cells. To overcome that, a 

wide variety of substituents can be introduced either axially or at the periphery of 

the macrocycle (40, 45, 93). Knowing that cancer cells have increased levels of 

galactose-binding proteins, the combination of carbohydrate moieties with 

macrocycles improves PS uptake and PDT efficacy. Furthermore, these 

carbohydrate units can also provide water-solubility to the macrocycles (16). 

The aim of this section is to describe the synthetic steps attempted to obtain 

SiPcs conjugated axially with galacto-dendritic units (Figure 2.1). The structure of 

the compounds was corroborated using spectroscopic and spectrometric 

techniques (nuclear magnetic resonance NMR, matrix-assisted laser 

desorption/ionization MALDI-MS and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, 

ESI+-MS). These studies were performed at University Autonoma of Madrid and 

University of Aveiro.

1.2 Synthesis of galacto-dendritic units 

 

Herein we report the synthesis of two galacto-dendritic units, differing only in 

the linker chain, and their further axial coordination with the SiPc macrocycle 

(Scheme 2.1). 1,2:3,4-di-O-isopropylidene-?-D-galactopyranose was chosen as the 

carbohydrate moiety, in order to relate these new compounds with our previous 

studies, which have already shown the importance of this carbohydrate unit in the 

photophysical, photochemical and photobiological results (15, 40, 72, 104). The 

selected dendritic framework was 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine (TCT) because of its 

well-known selective reactivity concerning the substitution of each chlorine atoms at 

different temperatures. The synthesis of dendritic units 2 and 3 was performed in 

two steps as depicted in Scheme 2.1. Although dendritic unit 3 is less nucleophilic 

than dendritic unit 2, it was expected that the electronegativity of the oxygen atom 

would allow the formation of a more stable bond with the silicon atom of the SiPc 

core than the one formed with the sulfur atom (105).

Compounds 2-chloro-4,6-bis(1,2:3,4-di-O-isopropylidene-?-D-galactopyran-

6-yl)-1,3,5-triazine [1] and 3-[(4,6-bis(1,2:3,4-di-O-isopropylidene-?-D-

galactopyran-6-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)thio]propane-1-thiol [2], were prepared 

according to a literature procedure, as shown in Scheme 2.1 (72). The nucleophilic 

substitution of the TCT by the galactose moieties was carried out in dry toluene, in 

the presence of an excess of N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) and stirred during 

48 h, under argon (Ar). The desired compound was purified by column 

chromatography on silica gel using a mixture of hexane (Hex) and ethyl acetate 

(AcOEt) (8:2 to 7:3 v/v) as eluent with a 66% of yield (lower than the one reported 

in the literature) (72). The carbohydrate units are linked to the TCT by the hydroxyl 

group located in carbon C-6. The following step to produce compound 2, was based 

on the addition of 1,3-dimercaptopropane to compound 1 in a reaction mixture with 

the same conditions as the ones to achieve compound 1, providing compound 2, 

with an yield of 75% (lower than the one reported in the literature) (72). 

To obtain the new compound 3, 1,3-dipropanediol was added to compound 

1, in a reaction mixture by using the same conditions employed for the synthesis of 

compound 2, but using sodium hydride (NaH) instead of DIPEA. The NMR and ESI+ 

MS studies demonstrated that the desired compound was not obtained because 

NaH hydrolyzed the galactose moieties of compound 1. Therefore, NaH was 

substituted by DIPEA, and compound 3 was obtained with 61% yield.  



Results and Discussion

The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 1 showed four singlets between ? 1.31-

1.49 ppm attributed to the isopropylidene methyl groups. The proton 5'-H appeared 

as a triple doublet at ? 4.18 ppm (J = 1.4, 6.4 and 6.5 Hz). The signals of protons 4'-

H and 2'-H emerged as multiplets at ? 4.31 ppm, while the protons 6'-H came out at 

? 4.53 ppm. The signal of the proton 3’-H appeared as a double doublet at ? 4.62 

ppm (J = 2.4 and 7.9 Hz). Finally, the doublet at ? 5.52 ppm (J = 5.0 Hz) was 

attributed to the resonance of the 1'-H.  

Regarding compound 2, the 1H NMR spectrum also showed four singlets 

between ? 1.32-1.49 ppm attributed to the resonances of the isopropylidene methyl 

groups. Then the 1,3-dimercaptopropane methylene and thiol groups appeared as 

multiplet signals: Hb (CH2CH2CH2SH) ? 2.02, Hc (CH2CH2CH2SH) 2.64, 2.75-2.80 

(SH) and Ha (CH2CH2CH2SH) 3.23 ppm. The remaining signals of the galactoses’ 

protons were the same as the ones corresponding to compound 1. 

Finally, compound 3 had a 1H NMR spectrum, shown in Figure 2.2, similar 

of compounds 1 and 2, having also two multiplets and a double doublet 

corresponding now to the 1,3-propanediol methylene groups: Hb (CH2CH2CH2OH) 

? 1.99, Hc (CH2CH2CH2OH) 3.76 and Ha (CH2CH2CH2OH) 4.54 ppm (J = 6.3 Hz), 

respectively. These last three signals were not observed in the 1H NMR spectrum 

of the final product prepared when using NaH as a base (route iiia), Scheme 2.1), 

which was the proof that we did not obtained the desired compound. The structure 

of the galacto-dendritic unit 3 was confirmed by mass spectrometry.

1.3 Synthesis of galacto-conjugated silicon phthalocyanines 

 

1.3.1 Synthesis of a symmetrical silicon phthalocyanine axial conjugated 

with galactose moieties [4] 

 

The synthetic route to achieve SiPc 4 (SiPcGal2, i.e. a SiPc containing two 

monomers of acetal-protected galactose) depicted in Scheme 2.2, it is already 

described in literature (45) and was prepared for comparative purposes with the 

SiPc conjugated axially with the aforementioned galacto-dendritic units 2 and 3. The 

commercially available silicon(IV) phthalocyanine dichloride (SiPcCl2) was treated 

with 1,2:3,4-di-O-isopropylidene-?-D-galactopyranose in the presence of NaH, in 

toluene reflux, under argon (Ar), during 48 h, giving the di-substituted SiPc 4 in 53% 

yield (higher than the one reported in the literature) (45). This compound was highly

soluble in a wide range of organic solvents and could be purified readily by column 

chromatography on silica gel. Then, once the aim of this newly PSs was to be 

recognized by the galactose-binding proteins overexpressed in cancer cells, it was 

necessary to hydrolyze the isopropylidene groups of the galactose molecules. The 

hydrolysis attempts were performed by employing two different approaches: i) by 

using TFA/H2O (9:1) as solvent, at room temperature (rt), during 5 h (72); and ii) 

with bromotrimethylsilane (TMSBr), using dichloromethane (DCM) as solvent, at rt, 

during 24 h (106). However, both hydrolysis resulted in the loss of the galactose 

molecules, thus producing SiPc dihydroxide (SiPc(OH)2).

The 1H NMR spectrum of SiPc 4 was well-defined. Upfield there were two 

double doublets that corresponded to the 6’-H protons: ? -2.37 (J = 8.8 and 9.3 Hz) 

and -1.70 (J = 5.3 and 8.3 Hz) ppm. The protons of the isopropylidene methyl groups 

appeared as singlets between ? 0.30 and 0.79 ppm. In the middle of this range, it 

was also possible to observe protons 5’-H at ? 0.68 ppm, which emerged together, 

in a virtual singlet, with one of the isopropylidene methyl groups. Proton 4’-H was 

localized at ? 0.76 ppm as a double doublet (J = 0.8 and 9.2 Hz). Then, there were 

two double doublets, 3’-H and 2’-H, at ? 3.22 (J = 0.4 and 8.5 Hz) and 3.32 (J = 1.6 

and 5.4 Hz) ppm, respectively, and a doublet corresponding to 1’-H at ? 4.37 ppm 

(J = 5.0 Hz). Finally, downfield there were two multiplets corresponding to the SiPc 

macrocycle: Pc-H? protons appeared between ? 8.28 and 8.31 ppm and then the

Pc-H? since ? 9.59 to 9.62 ppm. Through mass spectroscopy the structure of the 

SiPc 4 was confirmed. 

 

1.3.2 Synthesis of a symmetrical silicon phthalocyanine axially conjugated 

with compound 2 [5] 

 

In order to obtain SiPc 5, SiPcCl2 was treated with compound 2 in DMF and 

the reaction was refluxed under Ar, during 24 h (Scheme 2.3). This condition was 

optimized according to a procedure described in the literature (107). Yet, the desired 

compound was not obtained, indeed the 1,2:3,4-di-O-isopropylidene-a-D-

galactopyranose signals were not observed in the corresponding 1H NMR spectrum.

1.3.3 Synthesis of a symmetrical silicon phthalocyanine axially conjugated 

with compound 3 [6] 

 

The SiPc 6 was prepared by a reaction between the SiPcCl2 and five 

equivalents of 3 in the presence of pyridine as base and in toluene. The reaction 

was allowed to reflux for 72 h, giving the di-substituted SiPc 6 in 61% yield. This 

conditions were optimized according to the work of Ng et al, who described the axial 

coordination of a SiPc with 3- or 4-hydroxypyridine (108). SiPc 6 was highly soluble

in a wide range of organic solvents and could be easily purified by column 

chromatography on silica gel. Then, as last step, the hydrolysis of the isopropylidene 

protective groups was performed by using the same methodology employed for the 

preparation of SiPc 4 (Scheme 2.4), but unfortunately, once again, we obtained the 

dihydroxy derivative SiPc(OH)2.

The 1H NMR spectrum of SiPc 6 was well-defined (Figure 2.3). Upfield there 

were two triplets (Hc and Ha) and one multiplet (Hb) that emerged at: ? -1.99 (J = 6.5 

Hz) and 0.00 (J = 3.9 Hz) for the triplets and -1.06 ppm for the multiplet. The 

resonances of the isopropylidene methyl groups appeared as singlets between ? 

1.38 and 1.55 ppm. Protons 5'-H exhibited a triple doublet at ? 4.22 ppm (J = 1.0, 

4.0 and 4.0 Hz), protons 4’-H, 2’-H and 6’-H emerged as multiplets at ? 4.32, 4.39 

and 4.42 ppm, 3-H’ protons resonance came out as a double doublet at ? 4.69 ppm 

(J = 4.7 and 1.4 Hz) and the doublet at ? 5.64 ppm (J= 2.9 Hz) corresponded to 1'-

H. Downfield there were two multiplets corresponding to the Pc-protons: first the Pc-

H? protons between ? 8.29 and 8.31 ppm and then the Pc-H? since ? 9.55 to 9.57 

ppm. Through mass spectroscopy the structure of the SiPc 6 was confirmed.

Regarding all these reactions and final products obtained, the studies 

performed in this thesis (photochemical, photophysical and photobiological studies) 

were carried out using SiPcs 4 and 6, which were named as SiPcGal2 and 

SiPcGal4, respectively. Even though some photophysical, photochemical and in 

vitro studies of SiPcGal2 are already published (45, 109), we have also used this 

SiPc in our studies for comparative purposes between the axial conjugation with 

protected-galacto-dendritic units (SiPcGal4) and with protected-galactose 

molecules (SiPcGal2). Studies with the commercially available SiPc(OH)2 were also 

performed in order to evaluate the Pc-core properties. SiPc(OH)2 was obtained by 

reacting SiPcCl2 with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in methanol (MeOH) at rt, during 

30 min. 

There are no reports of the removal of the isopropylidene groups from sugar 

moieties axially conjugated to SiPc. Thus, in those kind of compounds described in 

literature the researchers use a Cremophor EL emulsion for the in vitro assays that 

stabilize the solutions of nonpolar materials in aqueous systems, preventing their 

aggregation (45, 62, 63). Although this has not been applied to SiPcs, another

alternative to improve the hydrophilicity of a PS (e.g. ZnPc) is by its incorporation 

into liposomes (110). Additionally, studies with SiPc(OH)2 were performed on HeLa 

cells by incorporation of the PS inside the silica shell, in order to improve its 

dispersibility in aqueous environments (111). These are alternative strategies that 

could have been applied to the obtained compounds in the photobiological studies 

performed in this thesis. 

It has to be taken into account that the idea of synthesizing a PS with affinity 

to the galactose-binding proteins overexpressed in cancer cells was unfortunately 

not accomplished because it was not possible to deprotect the galactose moieties 

of SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 thus preventing the interaction of the PS with those 

proteins. Therefore, the studies that will be further presented on this Master’s thesis 

will be mostly to evaluate the promising properties of the SiPc core as well as the 

influence that axial substituents have in the Pc hydrophilicity.  

Other routes can be performed to obtain the deprotected compounds, such 

as to deprotect first the galacto-dendritic units or the galactose molecules (112) and 

then axially conjugate them to the SiPc core. There are no papers that use that 

technique on SiPc, but it was reported the synthesis of a Por-glicopolymer based on 

a one-pot conjugation (combination of multi-reactions) (113) and also a gluco-

conjugated ZnPc via Click reaction (generation of substances quickly and reliably 

by joining small units together) (114).

2. Photophysical and photochemical studies of galacto-

conjugates 

 

In this section, photophysical and photochemical properties of SiPcGal4 and 

SiPcGal2 were determined and compared with those for SiPc(OH)2. UV-Visible 

(UV/Vis) characterization, PSs solubility in organic and aqueous solvents, 

fluorescence properties and ability to generate 1O2 were evaluated. These studies 

were performed at the University of Aveiro. 

 

2.1  UV-Visible characterization, water solubility and fluorescence 

emission  

 

The electronic absorption spectra of SiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2 

were initially acquired in the organic solvents DMF and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). 

All the SiPcs at 10 µM gave typical UV/Vis spectra for non-aggregated SiPcs 

showing an intense and sharp Q band in the red visible region. That Q band was 

observed at 677, 669 and 667 nm for SiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2, 

respectively, and the Soret bands around 348 nm (Figure 2.4). To determine the 

solubility of these compounds in an aqueous buffered solution, their absorption 

spectra were also acquired in PBS (Figure 2.4). This study is a critical parameter 

for the PSs’ PDT application, since in polar solvents, macrocycles have high 

aggregation tendency, disfavoring their efficacy as PDT agents (47). In PBS (3 % 

DMSO), the Q band of SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 undergo a significant broadening, 

which is a spectral feature of aggregated SiPcs. This feature was more evident for 

SiPc(OH)2 showing a higher aggregation of this compound. Therefore, these results 

demonstrated that the axial coordination increases the solubility of a SiPc in an 

aqueous solution, but to achieve strong hydrophilicity, the isopropylidene groups 

should be removed.  

The extinction coefficients (?) of the SiPcs in these three solvents are 

summarized in Table 2.1. The ? values of SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2 in DMF and 

DMSO, respectively, are already described in literature (45,115), and are similar 



Results and Discussion 

 

45 

 

with the ones described in this section. Comparing to others SiPcs axially 

conjugated with other protected sugars (e.g. glucose and cyclodextrin), the ? values 

in DMF were lower for SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 (62,63).

10 ?M in PBS (3 % DMSO, blue), DMF (green) and DMSO (red).  

 

 

Once the biological studies were going to be performed in PBS, even knowing 

that the three SiPcs aggregated in this solvent, their maximum concentration to be 

used on cells was determined. UV/Vis studies with increasing concentrations of the 

compounds (0 to 10 µM) in PBS solution containing DMSO (up to 3%) showed that 

SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 strictly follow the Beer-Lambert law at the studied 

concentrations suggesting their application in in vitro studies at concentrations 

below 10 µM (Figure 2.5). The same did not happened with SiPc(OH)2, because 

the absorbance at that concentration was very low and higher concentrations 

implied a percentage of DMSO higher than 3% (corresponding to 10 µM), which is 

not suitable for cellular assays. Previous assays performed by our group have

described that a percentage of DMSO higher than 0.5% significantly reduces the 

viability of human bladder cancer cells (UM-UC-3) (40,76), the same cells that we 

intended to use on the present study. Thus, even at a concentration of 10 µM, the 

percentage of DMSO was too high to be used. Therefore, only concentrations bellow 

1.66 µM of SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 in PBS (% DMSO ? 0.5) could be used for the 

in vitro PDT assays without compromising their phototoxic effectiveness evaluation.

Additionally, the solubility of the SiPcs in DMF was also evaluated for the 1O2 

generation and fluorescence studies that were performed in this organic solvent. 

These studies were carried out with increasing concentrations of the compounds 

(up to 10 µM) in DMF solutions showing that SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 strictly followed 

the Beer-Lambert law only till 5 µM and 1.25 µM, respectively (Figure 2.6).

The fluorescence emission of the PS provides information about its potential 

application in cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. The steady-state fluorescence 

emission spectra of SiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2 were acquired in DMF. The 

three SiPcs demonstrated fluorescence emission bands in the red region of the 

spectrum (approximately between 680 and 750 nm, Figure 2.7) which can be used 

to determine the concentration of these PSs inside the cells or tissues.

2.2 Singlet oxygen production 

 

To evaluate the potential use of SiPcGal4 as a new PS for PDT, its ability to 

generate 1O2 was evaluated in DMF. DPBF was used as 1O2 scavenger (63). DPBF 

is a yellow colored compound with a maximum of absorption at 415 nm, that reacts 

with 1O2 and it is oxidized to a colorless compound, the dibenzoylbenzene: thanks 

to this structural change, is possible to measure the scavenger absorption decay 

(116). The ability of SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2 to generate 1O2 was also determined, 

in order to evaluate the influence of the axial conjugation with dendritic units of 

galactose and the SiPc-core ability in the production of 1O2. SiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 and 

SiPc(OH)2 (0.3 µM), were able to photo-oxidize DPBF (30 µM) (Figure 2.8). Both 

galacto-conjugates demonstrated to be potent generators of 1O2, once SiPcGal4 

and SiPcGal2 were able to decompose 50% of DPBF after 15 min and 7 min of 

irradiation, respectively. The behavior of SiPcGal2 was similar to the one of 

SiPc(OH)2. These results showed that the conjugation of SiPc with protected 

galactose moieties or galacto-dendritic units does not compromise the 1O2 

production. Therefore, these studies showed the promising ability of the SiPc-core 

itself in the generation of this ROS.

2.3 Photostability of the galacto-conjugates 

 

To evaluate the potentiality of the galacto-conjugates as new PSs, it is also 

important to determine their photostability when exposed to UV-Vis light and O2. 

The intensity of the Q band of SiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2 was monitored 

after irradiation with red light at a fluence rate of 150 mW.cm-2 (Table 2.2). These 

results demonstrated that the three SiPcs are photostable over the irradiation period 

of 30 min.

3. In vitro studies of the galacto-conjugates  

 

3.1 Overview 

 

Pcs are PSs with great photochemical and photophysical properties. Their 

coordination to a silicon atom reduces their aggregation, since its axial 

funcionalization with different bulky groups improves their solubility in a variety of 

solvents. This is directly connected to photosensitizing efficiency as well as fine-

tune fluorescence and triplet state characteristics (52). In Part 2 was possible to 

evaluate those properties, showing that SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 were good 

fluorescence labels; stable after light irradiation and efficient generators of 1O2. 

However, as the deprotection of the isopropylidene groups of galactose was not 

achieved in those SiPcs, these compounds demonstrated reduced solubility in PBS. 

In Part 3, it will be evaluated the SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 potential as PSs in PDT 

based on uptake, phototoxicity and ROS production after PDT studies in a human 

bladder cancer cell line, UM-UC-3. The potential of SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 as PDT 

agents will be compared with the non-galacto-conjugated SiPc(OH)2. UM-UC-3 cell 

line derives from transitional cell carcinoma, which is the most common malignant 

tumor arising from the urothelium. The morphology of these cells is defined by poorly 

adherent, displaying a stellate morphology (117). Additionally, UM-UC-3 BC cells 

exhibit high levels of a galactose-binding protein, galectin-1 (40). 

These studies were performed at the Institute for Biomedical Imaging and 

Life Sciences (IBILI), Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra (FMUC).

Scheme 2.5 Chronology of uptake studies performed after incubation of UM-UC-3 BC cells 

with SiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2. 

  

  

  Based on the fact that UM-UC-3 cells display high levels of Gal-1, we initially 

hypothesized that the presence of the galactose units could facilitate the entry of 

SiPcs into BC cells. However, as discussed in Part 1, galactose-protective groups 

were not successfully removed during their synthesis. Although this fact can 

compromise cellular uptake, we proceeded this work by performing their biological 

evaluation as potential photosensitizing agents for PDT. The BC cells UM-UC-3 

were incubated with 1.66 µM SiPcs in the dark for different periods of time (up to 4 

h) in PBS containing DMSO (less than 0.5%). The fluorescence properties of these 

compounds allowed the evaluation of their intracellular accumulation by quantitative 

spectrofluorimetry and fluorescence microscopy. Each SiPc had different 

fluorescence characteristics, which can be observed in the calibration slopes 

represented in section 3.2.3 of Part 3 in Methods and Materials. The uptake of 

SiPcGal2 and SiPcGal4 was not dependent on the incubation time, probably due to 

their aggregation in PBS (as described in Part 2 of Results and Discussion) as 

well as to their incapacity of interaction with galectin-1 thanks to the galactose-

hydroxyl protective groups. Previous studies with a Pc containing eight dendritic 

units of galactose have demonstrated that its uptake in UM-UC-3 cancer cells is 

dependent on the concentration and reaches a plateau in less than 2 h (40). In the 

present study, the protected galactose molecules axially coordinated with SiPc did

not allow that uptake occurs in a both concentration- and uptake time dependent 

manner. Data showed that SiPcGal4 exhibited higher uptake than SiPcGal2 (Figure 

2.9), but these results were inconclusive due to the high aggregation of both SiPcs 

in a PBS containing DMSO (less than 0.5%) solution. Comparing the three SiPcs, 

SiPc(OH)2 had the higher uptake which can be explained by a non-specific 

mechanism caused by reduction of the membrane permeability barrier towards 

amphiphilic SiPc(OH)2. However, there are no records that can sustain this feature. 

Prior studies of SiPcGal2 in a Cremophor EL emulsion showed that this PS have 

high uptake and reaches a plateau after 2 h (45).

  The intracellular accumulation of PSs by UM-UC-3 cancer cells was also 

determined by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 2.10). Cells were incubated with 

1.66 µM of SiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2 for 3 h (in darkness) and cell nuclei 

were stained with DAPI. The fluorescence of the three PSs was remarkable. 

Fuorescence microscopy confirmed the spectrofluorimetric data showing that cells 

incubated with the three SiPc exhibit occasional bright spots in the perinuclear 

region. Apparently, for both SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 red spots were found outside 

the cells (Figure 2.10, A and B), suggesting aggregation of the two galacto-

conjugates. However, acquisition of fluorescence images in bright field could help 

to confirm the intracellular accumulation of the SiPc. Contrary to the other two SiPc, 

SiPc(OH)2 was found throughout the cytoplasm of cancer cells, showing co-

localization with the nuclei (Figure 2.10, C). This could be due to its amphilicity 

relatively to the other two PSs.  

  Previous studies of intracellular fluorescence of SiPcGal2 in a Cremophor EL 

emulsion showed that this Pcs exhibit a co-localization with mitochondria (stained 

with MitoTracker Green FM dye), but not in a exclusively way (45). It would be 

interesting to determine the intracellular location of the three SiPcs using organelle-

specific dyes.

3.3 Dark toxicity and phototoxicity determination of galacto-conjugates in 

UM-UC-3 bladder cancer cells 

 

  A good PS has to be non-toxic until activation by light at a specific 

wavelength. Thus, after confirming the uptake of PSs by UM-UC-3 cancer cells, PSs 

cytotoxicity in darkness was determined. UM-UC-3 cells were incubated with 

increasing concentrations of PSs (0.05 - 1.66 µM) in PBS (containing less than 0.5% 

DMSO) in darkness for 3 h. Cell viability was determined 24 h after treatment by 

MTT colorimetric assay, where the yellow-colored MTT is reduced by mitochondrial 

dehydrogenases in living cells to a formazan precipitate. The formazan absorbance 

is directly correlated with the metabolic activity of living cells. SiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 

and SiPc(OH)2 up to 1.66 µM did not induce significant dark toxicity (Figure 2.11).

irradiation after SiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2 uptake on cell viability, MTT was 

performed 24 h after treatment. After PSs uptake in darkness, cells were irradiated 

with red light at a potency of 2.5 mW.cm-2 for 40 min. Control experiments using 

irradiated cells (previously incubated with PBS (containing 0.5% DMSO) for 3 h in 

the dark) were performed, in order to determine the effect of red light irradiation 

alone on cell viability. These conditions did not induce toxicity in the cells. However, 

in the presence of the PSs, there was an increase of the phototoxicity dependent on 

the PS concentration.

Figure 2.12. Photocytotoxic effect after SiPc-PDT in UM-UC-3 cells evaluated 24 h after 

PDT. UM-UC-3 BC cells were incubated with increasing concentrations (0.05 - 1.66 µM) of 

SiPcGal4 (A), SiPcGal2 (B) and SiPc(OH)2 (C) for 3 h, in the dark, and then irradiated with 

white light at a fluence rate of 2.5 mW.cm-2 for 40 min. Cytotoxicity was assessed using 

MTT colorimetric assay 24 h after treatment. The percentage of cytotoxicity was calculated 

relatively to control cells (cells incubated with PBS (containing up to 0.5% DMSO) for 3 h in 

darkness and then irradiated). Data are the mean value ± SEM of two independent 

experiments performed in triplicates. *(p &amp;lt;0.05), **(p &amp;lt;0.001), ***(p &amp;lt;0.0001) significantly 

different from control cells. 

 

  

  Among these conditions, SiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2 presented 

similar ability to induce cell death after PDT with a percentage of toxicity of 18.52, 

28.77 and 26.72 %, respectively, at 1.66 µM. It is expected that only the non-

aggregated fraction of each SiPc would be able to induce cell death, though it is 

necessary to perform this study at higher concentrations or in bio-stable 

formulations. Comparing these results with the ones described in literature, the PSs 

phototoxicity was promising considering the aggregation problem. PcGal16 (Pc 

containing eight deprotected dendritic units of galactose), within the same 

conditions, after 2 h of uptake and at a PS concentration between 0.5 and 2.5 µM, 

the percentage of toxicity was of approximately 50% (2x higher than the SiPcs 

toxicity) (40), showing the great potential of these galacto-conjugated SiPcs to be 

studied in new approaches where the aggregation issue is resolved. Nevertheless, 

these results cannot be compared to the ones of SiPcGal2 in a Cremophor EL 

emulsion, because the conditions were very different: irradiation potency of 40 

mW.cm-2 (16 x higher) and they only used half of the irradiation time. Those results 

showed that a much lower concentration of SiPcGal2 (0.10 µM) was able to 

decrease cell viability by 50% (45).

3.4 SiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2 induced reactive oxygen species 

production after PDT in UM-UC-3 bladder cancer cells 

 

Since it is well established that ROS production has an important role in PDT-

induced cell death, the intracellular production of ROS was evaluated immediately 

after PDT in cells previously incubated with 1.66 µM of the three SiPc for 3 h. In 

order to correlate the PSs’ phototoxicity with ROS production, three different ROS-

sensitive probes: DHE, H2DCFDA and MiyoPy1 (118-120) were used. DHE is able 

to react with O2·? and be oxidized to ethidium, which intercalates within the cell’s 

DNA, staining the nucleus with bright red fluorescence. H2DCFDA reacts with 

several cytotoxic ROS leading to the formation of the fluorescence compound DCF. 

Finally, MitoPy1 selectively tracks to the mitochondria and responds to local fluxes 

of H2O2 by a turn on fluorescence enhancement. 

First, UM-UC-3 cells were incubated for 3 h with PBS (control) or 1.66 µM of 

SiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2, in darkness and then they were irradiated for 

40 min. None of the SiPcs tested induced a high production of ROS after PDT 

(Figure 2.13). Regarding SiPcGal4, this PS did not showed an increase in the O2·? 

production, but the generation of H2O2 and total ROS was significant. SiPcGal2 and 

SiPcOH2 showed, after PDT, a significant increase in the production of O2·?, H2O2 

and total ROS. Once again, it is expected that only the non-aggregated fraction of 

each SiPc would be able to produce ROS, though it is necessary to perform this 

study at higher concentrations or in bio-stable formulations. SiPcGal2 in a 

Cremophor EL emulsion showed high production of ROS levels as determined using 

DCFDA probe (109).

III. Conclusions and future perspectives 

 

In this Master’s dissertation, we attempted the synthesis of symmetrical water 

soluble SiPcs axially coordinated with galacto-dendritic units. We also aimed the 

removal of the isopropylidene galactose-protective groups from the already 

described in the literature, SiPc axially conjugated with two galactose moieties 

(SiPcGal2), so that we can have a comparative compound. These galactose 

molecules will be recognized by galectins (galactose-binding proteins), 

overexpressed in bladder tumors. Thus, after the drug design, the following step 

was to study their photophysical and photochemical properties, and to validate them 

as photodynamic therapeutic agents against BC cells.  

 

The preparation of the two SiPc axially conjugated with galacto-dendritic units 

was partially achieve once it was only possible to perform the coordination step of 

the SiPc dichloride (SiPcCl2) with the protected galacto-dendritic units containing 

the 1,3-propanediol chain (SiPcGal4). Additionally, our several attempts to 

hydrolyze the isopropylidene groups of the galactose molecules in either the 

SiPcGal4 or SiPcGal2 failed. However, a new galacto-dendritic unit [3] was obtained 

and in future work, different approaches could be used to then produce the desired 

final PS. One methodology that can be applied is to first hydrolyze the 

isopropylidene groups of compound 3, with TFA/water (9:1) and then conjugate it 

with the SiPcCl2 in a reflux DMF reaction. Other route than we can undergo is to 

hydrolyze the isopropylidene groups of compound 1 and then conjugate it with 

SiPc(OH)2 in a reflux DMF reaction with potassium carbonate (K2CO3). Finally, to 

obtain SiPcGal2 with the deprotected galactose molecules, we can conjugate the 

commercially available D-(+)-galactose with SiPcCl2 also in a reflux DMF reaction 

with K2CO3. However, it is possible that we will be confronted with solubility issues 

to perform these reactions. 

 

Regarding the photophysical and photochemical studies, both galacto-

conjugates were also compared with SiPc dihydroxide (SiPc(OH)2) in order to 

understand if the SiPc core properties are useful for future drug design. SiPcGal4

and SiPcGal2 containing the isopropylidene groups demonstrated some particular 

properties that allowed us to predict the behavior of these macrocyclic cores. Of 

course there were some issues on their hydrophilicity under physiological 

conditions, which are fundamental for drug administration. Yet, in comparison with 

the SiPc(OH)2, their water solubility was higher due to the presence of axial 

substituents that reduced their aggregation. Thus, if the isopropylidene goups’ 

hydrolysis was successfully accomplished, the solubility would be much higher. The 

typical spectra of this SiPcs contained a strong Q-band absorption at around 670 

nm (therapeutic window), which allows deeper tissue penetration upon light 

irradiation. Both PSs also demonstrated to be good 1O2 generators and photostable 

upon 30 min of irradiation, which showed their high capacity to be used as PDT 

agents. Determination of the galacto-conjugates affinity to HSA and galectin-1 

proteins could be an interesting approach to perform if we were successful in the 

hydrolysis of the galactoses’ protective groups. HSA is a blood protein that is able 

to transport many drugs to the effector place demonstrating their ADME properties 

and galectin-1 is a galactose-binding protein overexpressed in BC cells.  

 

For the in vitro photodynamic assays, a human bladder cancer cell line, UM-

UC-3, derived from the transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder was used. The 

uptake of the two galacto-conjugates was lower than the uptake of the SiPc(OH)2. 

This feature resulted from non-specific mechanism caused by reduction of the 

membrane permeability barrier towards amphiphilic SiPc(OH)2. However, the PSs 

uptake was not correlated with the concentration and incubation time increment, due 

to their high aggregation in PBS solution, leaving the results inconclusive. The 

fluorescence microscopy study suggested that aggregation outside of the cells may 

occur, but on the other hand, it was clear their outstanding fluorescence properties.  

SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2 were non-toxic in the dark but after photoactivation, 

they induced a significant decrease in cell viability. However, once these SiPcs 

aggregate in cells, it was expected that only a fraction of the administered Pc (non-

aggregated fraction) will induce cell death, thus being difficult to interpret these 

results.  



Conclusion and future perspectives

The PSs-induced ROS after PDT were also studied and showed an increase 

of the H2O2 present in the mitochondria and also of other general ROS in the 

cytoplasm. If these results were from the deprotected SiPcGal4 and SiPcGal2, the 

next step could be studies of fluorescence microscopy using different fluorescent 

probes to study co-localization of the new PSs with different organelles. Another 

study that could be performed if we had the desired compounds, is the 

immunofluorescence staining of Gal-1 to observe the subcellular localization of this 

lectin and the galacto-conjugates in BC cells, and their possible co-localization. 

Specific inhibition of galectin-1 expression by RNAi (interference ribonucleic acid) 

could also be an approach to be used in future works, in an attempt to investigate 

the involvement of this protein in the uptake of the PSs BCa cells.

2. Photophysical and photochemical studies of galacto-

conjugates 

 

2.1 Equipment and reagents 

 

2.1.1 Equipment 

The UV-visible assays were performed on the UVIKON 922 

spectrophotometer from Biotek Instruments.  

The illumination system used to determine the photostability of the PSs was 

the Light Source Model LC-122 from LumaCare, equipped with a halogen/quartz 

250 W lamp coupled to one optic fiber probe (400-800 nm). The fluence rates were 

determined with the energy meter Coherent FieldMaxII-Top with a Coherent 

PowerSens PS19Q energy sensor. 

For the 1O2 generation study it was used a Light Emitting Diode (LED) array 

prepared by Mr. Cândido Casqueira, electromechanic technician of the Department 

of Chemistry of the University of Aveiro. It is composed of a matrix of 6 x 8 LEDs 

which makes a total of 48 light sources, emitting red light (? &gt; 600 nm). The regulated 

Plug-in adaptor with LED indicator 800 mA was purchased from Mean Well (MW). 

 

2.1.2 Reagents, chemical products and buffers 

SiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2 were synthesized as described in Part 1. 

DMSO, DMF and DPBF were obtained from Fisher Scientific. PBS buffer was 

prepared in Milli-Q water at pH 7.60: 10 mM NaH2PO4, 70 mM Na2HPO4 and 145 

mM NaCl. 

 

2.1.3 Softwares 

Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 5.00 were used for the displayed 

graphs. 

  



Methods and Materials

2.2 Experimental procedures 

 

2.2.1 Aggregation assays 

 

The aggregation behavior of the PSs in PBS buffer, DMSO and DMF was 

studied at different concentrations by Lambert-Beer´s law plots. This equation is 

based on the linear correlation between absorbance (A), molar absorptivity of the 

compound (?, L.mol-1.cm-1), length of the light path (b, cm) and concentration of the 

compound in solution (c, mol.L-1) (121). 

First, stock solutions of the galacto-conjugates (330 µM) were prepared in 

DMSO and frozen. The working solutions were freshly prepared by diluting the stock 

solutions in PBS buffer (1.25-10 µM) with the concentration of DMSO being always 

inferior to 3% (v/v). Quartz cuvettes holding one milliliter of working solutions 

(without air bubbles) were placed into the spectrophotometer and the absorbance 

was scanned for wavelengths between 300 to 800 nm. The wavelengths of 

maximum absorption were determined and the molar absorptivity of the compounds 

was calculated by plotting the absorbance against the respective concentration, by 

Lambert -Beer´s law, considering the length of the light path (b) equal to 1 cm. The 

same procedure was performed with the compounds dissolved in complete DMSO 

and DMF. 

 

2.2.2 Fluorescence emission assay 

 

SiPcGal4, SiPcGal2 and SiPc(OH)2 working solutions were freshly prepared 

in DMF to give absorbance near 0.03 (conditions that minimize reabsorption of 

radiation by the ground-state species) at 601 nm. The fluorescence emission 

spectra of the PSs were measured between 620 to 800 nm, after excitation at 601 

nm. The excitation and emission slits width were set at 2.0 nm.

2.2.3 Photostability assays 

 

The photostability of PSs was determined by monitoring the decrease of the 

absorbance of Q bands, after different times of irradiation with red light (400-800 

nm) delivered by an illumination system. Solutions of PSs at 20 µM were prepared 

in PBS buffer (6% v/v DMSO) and kept in the dark at rt. The study was performed 

in magnetically stirred cuvette solutions (with 1 mL of sample) in a dark room, over 

an irradiation time of 30 min with red light at a fluence rate of 150 mW.cm-2. The 

absorbance between 640 and 730 nm (Q band that corresponds to the maximum 

absorbance of PSs) was determined before and after irradiation (1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 

20 and 30 min). After that, the photostability percentage was calculated with the 

following equation: 

 

?????????????? (%) =
??? ?? ? ????? ???? ?? ???????????

??? ?????? ???????????
 

 

2.2.4 Singlet oxygen assays 

 

Singlet oxygen was determined through an indirect chemical method using 

DPBF as 1O2 scavenger (122). The DPBF reacts specifically with 1O2 in a [4+2] 

cycloaddition reaction, being oxidized to the colorless o-dibenzoylbenzene. Once 

DPBF has an absorption maximum at 415 nm, the ability of the PSs to generate 1O2 

is obtained by measuring the DPBF absorption decay, at this wavelength.

Solutions containing DPBF (30 µM) with or without the PSs (0.30 µM) were 

prepared in DMF in a one milliliter quartz cuvette. The solutions were irradiated at rt 

and under gentle magnetic stirring, with red light at a fluence rate of 5 mW.cm-2. The 

decreasing of DPBF absorbance value at 415 nm was monitored at pre-established 

irradiation intervals. The results were expressed by plotting the DPBF depletion 

against the irradiation time. The depletion of DPBF was calculated according to the 

following equation:  

 

???? ????????? =

3.1.5 Softwares 

Paint Shop ProTM (v.6.00, Jasc Software) was used for the treatment of the 

images obtained in microscopy. GraphPad Prism (v.5.00, GraphPad Software) was

Wallis test. Statistical significance among several conditions was assessed with the 

Friedman test. P-value was considered at the 5% level of significance to deduce 

inference of the significance of the data. 

 

3.2 Experimental procedures 

 

3.2.1 Cell culture and subculture 

 

 UM-UC-3 cells were grown in RPMI medium. After two to three days, 

confluent cells were subcultured. The medium was removed from culture flasks by 

aspiration and discarded. The cell layers were washed with 10 mL of pre-warmed 

sterile PBS, in order to remove traces of FBS that would inhibit the action of the 

trypsin. After that, the cells were treated with 2.5 mL of trypsin Tryple Express and 

incubated during 5 min at 37 ºC until the cells rounded up and the cell layer start to 

disperse. The trypsinization progress was monitored under an inverted microscope. 

After incubation, RPMI medium was added to inhibit further tryptic activity and the 

cells were dispersed by repeated pippeting over the monolayer surface. The cells 

suspensions were then centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 5 min. The supernatant was 

removed, the cells were re-suspended in RPMI medium and appropriate aliquots of 

cells were added to new 75 cm2 culture flasks. Cells were examined carefully every 



Methods and Materials 

 

87 

 

day by eye on an inverted microscope, for signs of contamination and the RPMI 

medium was changed two or three times per week (118). 

 

3.2.2 Preparation and treatment of UM-UC-3 cells with photosensitizers  

 

After the removal of supernatant and the re-suspension of the cells in 10 mL 

of RPMI medium as described before, 20 µL of cell suspension was mixed with 20 

µL of trypan blue stain to determine cellular viability. Trypan Blue is an organic 

amine dye that is excluded by living cells with intact membranes, while death cells, 

where the plasma membrane integrity is compromised, take up the dye. Thus, all 

the cells that are blushed with the dye are considered non-viable and appear with a 

blue color in the microscope. On the other hand, viable cells will appear brilliant. 

Cells were counted using a haemocytometer. The percentage of viable cells and the 

concentration of cells per milliliter of cell suspension were calculated according to 

the following equations: 

 

?????? ????? (%) =
?º ?? ?????? ?????

?º  ?? ????? ?????
 × 100 

 

?????? ?????

??
=

??? × ???????? ??????

1 × 10?4
 

 

Only cells with viability superior to 90% were utilized in the experiments. The viable 

cells concentration was calculated considering the average of viable cells (VCs) per 

each counting square, the dilution made and the volume of each counting square. 

After this, UM-UC-3 cells were seeded into cell culture plates of 24 or 96-

wells according to the experiment, at a density of 18 x 104 and 3 x 104 cells.cm-2 

respectively, and incubated overnight in an incubator at 37 ºC with 5% CO2 and 95% 

air to promote cell adhesion. On the following day, the UM-UC-3 cells growing in 

monolayer culture were treated with desired concentrations of sterile solutions of 

PSs.  



Methods and Materials 

 

88 

 

Stock solutions of the PSs at a concentration of 330 µM were prepared in 

sterile DMSO and stored at 0-4 ºC in dark conditions. Freshly working solutions with 

different concentrations were obtained from the respective stock solution in sterile 

PBS, accounting their water solubility range. The concentration of DMSO was 

always lower than 0.5% (v/v), in all working solutions. 

 

3.2.3 Determination of intracellular PS concentration by fluorimetry 

 

Taking into account the fluorescence properties of the Pcs, their 

concentration inside the cancer cells can be determined by fluorimetry (after cell 

lysis) and normalized to total protein quantity. The protein quantification was 

measured spectrophotometrically using the Bicinchoninic Acid Assay (BCA assay), 

also known as the Smith assay (123). The procedure involves two fundamental 

steps: 1) biuret reaction, where the cupric ion (Cu2+) is reduced to cuprous ion (Cu+) 

by peptide bonds in proteins, in an alkaline environment, resulting in a blue color, 

and therefore, the amount of reduced Cu2+ is proportional to the amount of protein 

present in the solution; 2) the chelation of two molecules of BCA with one cuprous 

ion results in an intense purple-colored product that can be measure at any 

wavelength between 550 nm and 570 nm. 

 

A. Determination of intracellular PS fluorescence 

 

UM-UC-3 cells were seeded into 96-wells cell culture plates at a density of 3 

x 104 cells per well (final volume of 100 µL per well) and incubated overnight in an 

incubator at 37 ºC with 5% CO2 and 95% air. On the following day, immediately after 

PSs incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS. Then, they were mechanically 

scrapped in 120 µL of 1% (m/v) SDS solution in PBS (pH 7.0) and the plate was 

stirred on an automatic plate shaker in the dark at rt. 90 µL of this cell suspension 

were transferred to 96-wells black plates and the intracellular fluorescence of the 

PSs was determined by fluorometric measurement, using standard PSs solutions (0 

– 6.25 µM) for calibration (Figure 4.1). The intracellular fluorescence was 

determined using a Typhoon FLA 9000 imager (GE Healthcare) with a 100-µm spot

resolution and 300 V. The excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 635 nm 

(red LD laser) and LPR (665LP), respectively. The PS concentration in the samples 

was directly obtained by plotting the average of the fluorescence for each PS 

standard in function of its concentration (µM). The results were normalized for 

protein concentration.

B. Determination of protein concentration 

 

In a 96-wells plate, the following solutions were pipetted into each well: 

- 25 µL of sample buffer: 1% (m/v) SDS in PBS (pH 7.0), 

- 25 µL of sample, blank (sample buffer), standard (prepared in the sample 

buffer at concentrations ranging from 12.5-800 µg.mL-1 using the BSA standard at 2 

mg.mL-1), 

- 150 µL of BCA working Reagent (50 parts of BCA reagent A mixed with one 

part of BCA reagent B). 

The plate was incubated at 37 ºC for 30 min. Then, the absorbance at 570 

nm was measured in the plate reader spectrophotometer. The protein concentration

in the samples was directly obtained by plotting the average of the absorbance at 

570 nm for each BSA standard in function of its concentration (µg.mL-1). 

 

3.2.4 Determination of intracellular PS fluorescence by fluorescence 

microscopy 

 

Knowing the fluorescence properties of Pcs, their intracellular fluorescence 

can also be evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. Coverslips (one per well in 24-

wells culture plates) were coated with poly-L-lysine for 1 h at rt. Then, after drying 

completely the UM-UC-3 were plated at a density of 18 x 104 cells per well (200 µL 

per well), in 24-wells culture plates for 3 h before treatment. After PS uptake and 

washing, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min at rt. The samples were washed 

with PBS (2 x 5 min). The coverslips were mounted using Vectashield sealed with 

nail polish and stored at 4 ºC until visualization under the fluorescence microscope. 

 

3.2.5 Photodynamic Assays 

 

The desired effect that is expected to obtain after photo-activation of PS is 

not only its preferential accumulation in cancer cells, but also its toxicity only upon 

light irradiation. That is why it is important to study the PSs toxicity in the absence 

and presence of light irradiation. 

After PSs incubation, cells were washed with PBS and then it was added 100 

µL of RPMI medium to cover the cells. In a dark room, cells were irradiated during 

40 min with red light at a potency of 2.5 mW.cm-2. After irradiation, cells were 

incubated in the humidified incubator gassed with 5% CO2 and 95% air. 

 

3.2.6 Cell viability assay 

 

To evaluate the toxicity and phototoxicity of the PSs the MTT assay was 

used. In living cells, MTT is reduced by the mitochondrial enzyme succinate 

dehydrogenase to the insoluble blue purple formazan crystals, which means that it 



Methods and Materials 

 

91 

 

is possible to correlate the reduction of MTT with this enzyme activity and therefore 

with the cellular viability (124). 

UM-UC-3 cells were plated before at a density of 3 x 104 cells per well, in 96-

wells culture plates for 24 h before treatment and then were treated with the PSs. 

The photodynamic treatment was performed and after 24 h, 50 µL of the medium 

was removed and 10 µL of MTT stock solution (3 mg.mL-1 in PBS buffer) was added 

to each well in order to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 mg.mL-1. The plates were 

then incubated at 37 ºC with 5% CO2 and 95% air for 3 h. After that, the formed 

purple crystals were dissolved by the addition of 150 µL of acidic isopropanol (0.04 

M HCl in absolute isopropanol), with repeated pipetting. The absorbance was 

measured at 570 nm (using 620 nm as the background wavelength), using a plate 

reader spectrophotometer: Absorbance 570 nm – Absorbance 620 nm. The 

percentage of absorbance for each treated sample was normalized to each 

untreated control cells (cells incubated with only PBS): 

 

??? ????????? (%) =  
??? (??????? ???????)

??? (????????? ???????)
× 100 

 

3.2.7 Intracellular levels of Reactive Oxygen Species after PDT 

 

The ROS generation after PDT were detected using three different probes: 

H2DCFDA (118), DHE (119) and MitoPy1 (120), by fluorescence spectroscopy 

technique. H2DCFDA is able to cross the cell membrane and intracellular esterases 

remove its acetate groups, producing H2DCF that will react with several cytotoxic 

ROS and form DCF which fluorescence intensity can be measured and be directly 

correlated with the intracellular ROS levels. DHE probe has blue fluorescence and 

it diffuses across cell membrane. O2·? anions oxidize DHE to ethidium, which 

intercalates within the cell’s DNA, staining the nucleus with bright red fluorescence. 

MitoPy1 probe selectively tracks to the mitochondria and responds to local fluxes of 

H2O2 with a turn-on fluorescence increase. 

 UM-UC-3 cells were plated in 96-wells black plates for 24 h before treatment. 

After photodynamic treatment and washing, cells were incubated with 5 µM of the 



Methods and Materials 

 

92 

 

three probes, under dark conditions, for 1 h at 37ºC. After incubation, cells were 

washed with PBS and mechanically scrapped in 1% (m/v) SDS solution in PBS (pH 

7.0). Then, the intracellular fluorescence was measured with excitation and 

emission filters of 485/20 and 590/35 nm for H2DCFDA, 485/20 and 528/20 nm for 

DHE and MitoPy1. Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce® BCA 

Protein Assay Kit as described previously.
