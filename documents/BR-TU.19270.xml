Abstract

Introduction: Transsexualism (ICD-10) is a condition characte-
rized by a strong and persistent dissociation with one’s assigned 
gender. Sex reassignment surgery (SRS) and hormone therapy 
provide a means of allowing transsexual individuals to feel more 
congruent with their gender and have played a major role in 
treatment over the past 70 years. Brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF) appears to play a key role in recovery from acute 
surgical trauma and environmentally mediated vulnerability to 
psychopathology. We hypothesize that BDNF may be a biomarker 
of alleviation of gender incongruence suffering.
Objectives: To measure preoperative and postoperative serum 
BDNF levels in transsexual individuals as a biomarker of allevia-
tion of stress related to gender incongruence after SRS.
Methods: Thirty-two male-to-female transsexual people who 
underwent both surgery and hormonal treatment were selected 
from our initial sample. BDNF serum levels were assessed befo-
re and after SRS with sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA). The time elapsed between the pre-SRS and post-
-SRS blood collections was also measured.
Results: No significant difference was found in pre-SRS or post-
-SRS BDNF levels or with relation to the time elapsed after SRS 
when BDNF levels were measured.
Conclusion: Alleviation of the suffering related to gender in-
congruence after SRS cannot be assessed by BDNF alone. Sur-
gical solutions may not provide a quick fix for psychological dis-
tress associated with transsexualism and SRS may serve as one 
step toward, rather than as the conclusion of, construction of a 
person’s gender identity.
Keywords: Transsexualism, sex reassignment surgery, BDNF.

Resumo

Introdução: O transexualismo (CID-10) é uma condição caracte-
rizada por forte e persistente dissociação com o gênero atribuído. 
A cirurgia de redesignação sexual (CRS) e a terapia hormonal (TH) 
permitem que indivíduos transexuais se sintam mais congruentes 
com seu gênero e, por isso, têm desempenhado papel importan-
te nos últimos 70 anos. O fator neurotrófico derivado do cérebro 
(BDNF) parece desempenhar um papel fundamental na recupera-
ção do trauma cirúrgico agudo e vulnerabilidade ambiental à psico-
patologia. Nós hipotetizamos que o BDNF pode ser um biomarcador 
de alívio do sofrimento de incongruência de gênero pós-CRS.
Objetivos: Mensurar os níveis séricos de BDNF no pré e pós-ope-
ratório em indivíduos transexuais como biomarcador de alívio de 
estresse relacionado à incongruência de gênero após a CRS.
Métodos: Trinta e duas pessoas transexuais masculino para femi-
nino submetidas a cirurgia e tratamento hormonal foram selecio-
nadas de nossa amostra inicial. O nível sérico de BDNF foi avaliado 
antes e depois da CRS pela técnica ELISA. O tempo decorrido entre 
as coletas de sangue pré e pós-CRS foi medido.
Resultados: Não houve diferença significativa nos níveis de BDNF 
pré e pós-CRS ou em relação ao tempo decorrido entre a CRS e 
a coleta.
Conclusão: O alívio do sofrimento relacionado à incongruência de 
gênero pós-CRS não pode ser avaliado apenas pelo BDNF. Soluções 
cirúrgicas podem não fornecer uma solução rápida para o sofrimen-
to associado ao transexualismo, e a CRS pode servir como um pas-
so em direção à, em vez de conclusão da, construção da identidade 
de gênero de uma pessoa.
Descritores: Transexualismo, cirurgia de redesignação sexual,

BDNF serum concentrations in transsexuals - Schneider MA et al.

The aim of our study was to explore whether BDNF 
levels before and after SRS correlate with recovery from 
psychological distress in transsexual individuals, as they 
correlate with recovery from distress in other disorders, 
such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute 
trauma, and major depression. Although several studies 
have evaluated psychological recovery using subjective 
tools, no studies have evaluated the potential of a 
biological marker as an objective tool for assessing post-
SRS  alleviation of transsexual suffering.

Materials and methods

Participants and procedures

In this prospective cohort study, male-to-female 
transsexual people were recruited between February 
2009 and December 2015 and monitored after SRS. All 
patients underwent classic penile inversion vaginoplasty, 
the surgical gold standard for male-to-female 
reassignment. All operations were performed by a single 
surgeon with many years of experience in this technique.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: diagnosis of 
transsexualism (ICD-10) established by a psychiatrist, 
age greater than 18 years, and a post-SRS period of 
at least 6 months. We have chosen to use the term 
transsexualism based on ICD-10 criteria; however, we 
are aware of current nomenclature changes. Patients 
suffering from axis I psychotic disorders, mental 
retardation, or substance addiction were excluded from 
the study. Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic 
criteria are now no longer used, data collection was 
carried out between 2008 and 2015, when these 
criteria were still current, and the Mini International 
Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI 6.0) is in accordance 
with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, 4th edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR). All 
patients signed an informed consent form for the study, 
which was approved by the Research Ethics Committee 
(CEP HCPA Nº 08-167).

During this period, we evaluated 84 new patients 
in the clinic. Of these patients, 65 fully fit the surgical 
criteria and underwent SRS; 33 of these 65 patients 
were excluded from the analysis due to a lack of data 
or because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. The 
final sample contained 32 individuals. All male-to-female 
transsexuals who underwent both surgery and hormone 
treatment during this period were selected for the study. 
Figure 1 illustrates the process of exclusion or inclusion 
of participants who attended the initial evaluation.

Introduction

Transsexualism (International Classification of 
Diseases, version 10 [ICD-10]) is a condition characterized 
by a strong and persistent dissociation with one’s assigned 
gender.1 This experience is psychologically taxing and is 
compounded by distress caused by social stigmatization.2 

Furthermore, transsexual individuals report a high 
prevalence of childhood trauma, with particularly high rates 
of emotional abuse and negligence. Sex reassignment 
surgery (SRS) and hormone therapy provide a means of 
allowing transsexual individuals to feel more congruent with 
their gender, and have played a major role in treatment 
over the past 70 years.1-6

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a 
member of the growth factor family that is involved in 
promoting synaptic plasticity, including neurogenesis, 
neuronal survival, and the normal maturation of neuronal 
developmental pathways.7-9 Low BDNF levels are a 
biomarker for a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, such 
as advanced bipolar disease,10 major depressive episodes11 

and schizophrenia.12 BDNF levels increase in response to 
antidepressant, lithium, and valproate treatments.8

BDNF has also been linked to several recovery 
situations. While low BDNF levels have been associated with 
substance abuse disorder, increased levels of brain-derived 
neurotrophin were found during abstinence in substance 
abuse disorders, e.g., alcohol withdrawal,13 likely signaling 
neuronal recovery. Additionally, high levels of BDNF have 
been associated with craving in opiate-dependent patients, 
signaling a possible maladaptive plasticity associated 
with drug-seeking behavior during abstinence,14 and a 
similar pattern has been observed in patients with cocaine 
dependence, possibly predicting cocaine abuse relapse.15

Extensive research has been conducted over the 
past two decades focusing on the means by which BDNF 
modulates neuroplasticity. For example, in 1995 Korte 
et al.16 showed that BDNF is predominantly synthesized 
by neurons and Bergami et al.,17 showed that astrocytes 
play the role of storing and secreting BDNF. Moreover, glia 
have been found to utilize BDNF in neuroinflammatory and 
neuroprogressive processes,18 such as neuronal lesions19 

and inflammatory conditions.20

The way in which hormone therapy in transsexuals may 
alter BDNF levels has proven a controversial subject. Fuss 
et al.21 conducted a study comparing transsexual females 
with controls and found no differences in BDNF levels 
after estrogen therapy, Fontanari et al.,22 supposed that 
the low BDNF levels they found in transsexual individuals 
could be related to emotional trauma in childhood, while 
Kauer et al.,23 found that low BDNF levels – as detected, 
for example, in bipolar individuals – were associated with 
traumatic life events.

Main outcome measures

Five mL of peripheral blood were taken from each 
subject by venipuncture into an anti-coagulant-free 
vacuum tube. The blood was centrifuged at 4000 x 
g for 10 min, and the serum was frozen at -80 ºC until 
assayed. Tests were conducted with sandwich enzyme 
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), according to the 
manufacturer’s specifications (Chemicon, USA). In short, 
96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates were filled with the 
samples (diluted 1:2 in sample diluents) and left for a 
24-hour period. The standard curve ranged from 7.8 to 
500 pg of BDNF. Plates were then washed four times with 
wash buffer, monoclonal anti-BDNF rabbit antibody (diluted 
1:1000 with sample diluents) was added, and then plates 
were incubated for three hours at room temperature. After 
washing, a second incubation with anti-rabbit antibody 
peroxidase conjugate (diluted 1:1000) was carried out for 
one hour at room temperature. Next, streptavidin-enzyme, 
substrate, and stop solution were added, and the amount 
of BDNF was measured (absorbance set at 450 nm). The 
standard curve demonstrated a direct relationship between 
optical density and BDNF concentration. Total protein was 
measured using Lowry’s method, using bovine serum 
albumin as a standard.

Analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for 
the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18.0. Most BDNF value 
fits were normally distributed and were therefore subjected

to parametric analyses. Two-sided paired t test analyses 
were conducted to compare BDNF measures, significant at 
p &amp;lt;0.05. Data were presented as the mean ± standard 
deviation. Pearson correlations were used to analyze the 
relationship between  the time of blood collection, in days 
after SRS, and BDNF levels.

Results

The mean age of transsexual patients was 28.75±6.53. 
BDNF serum levels were measured 279.28±190.34 days 
after male-to-female SRS. The interval between the first 
and the second blood sample collections was 847±797.09 
days. Mean serum BDNF levels were 18.55±5.99 and 
17.83±6.47, pre-SRS and post-SRS respectively. There was 
no difference between pre-SRS and post-SRS BDNF levels: 
? = -0.73, median difference = -1.36 t32 = 0.67, p = 0.50, 
95% confidence interval = -1.46 to 2.92 (Figure 2). There 
was no significant correlation between the time of blood 
collection after SRS and post-SRS BDNF levels (r = -0.11, 
p = 0.54) or between the time between the pre-SRS and 
post-SRS blood collections and post-SRS BDNF levels (r = 
-0.05, p = 77).

Fifteen HIV+ subjects were included in the sample. 
These patients were included in the final analysis because 
we were comparing the same cases before and after 
SRS and so this confounding factor affected the two data 
collection times equally.

Discussion

BDNF has been identified as a possible predictor of 
treatment response in some types of psychiatric distress.24 
There is also evidence to suggest that patients remain

46 – Trends Psychiatry Psychother. 2017;39(1) 

satisfied after SRS and that it alleviates the suffering 
caused by living in non-conformity with their gender 
identity.25-27 In alignment with this extant research, this 
study posited that alleviation of this suffering after SRS 
would be traceable through BDNF serum levels.

However, contrary to this hypothesis, the difference 
between preoperative and postoperative BDNF levels 
was not significant. One way to interpret these findings 
is to consider that SRS could serve as one step toward, 
rather than the conclusion of, a person’s gender identity 
construction and so the molecular response may require 
extensive recuperation, not occurring immediately after 
SRS. This interpretation can be sustained considering 
that SRS cannot reverse the effects of the chronic 
psychological trauma associated with transsexuals’ life 
experiences, at least not in the short term or as an 
isolated intervention.

 Another important point to consider is the 
effect on BDNF levels of the neuroactive steroids used by 
patients. All of our participants were undergoing hormonal 
sex reassignment therapy. A myriad of in vitro studies 
have evaluated the type of neuronal effects exerted 
by the steroids we currently use in the reassignment 
process. Estradiol and progesterone have been shown to 
directly and indirectly increase neuroplasticity, via BDNF 
augmentation and glutamate respectively.28 These in 
vitro models have demonstrated that steroidal hormones 
augment release of BDNF from neurons or astrocytes.29

Notably, Fuss et al.,21 found a negative correlation 
between estradiol treatment during the reassignment 
process and BDNF levels in their group of transsexual 
women. Their finding was somewhat surprising, because 
earlier studies had found the opposite. There is a correlation 
between the menses cycle and brain neurotrophin 
secretion, for example, with positive BDNF fluctuation in 
response to estradiol30 at the end of the follicular phase. 
On one hand, we expect elevation of BDNF levels after SRS 
– consistent with other psychiatric models of suffering 
alleviation (anxiety, major depression, bipolar disease, 
schizophrenia, and PTSD) – but on the other hand, we 
have information that BDNF levels diminish with estradiol 
treatment. We can therefore hypothesize that the effects 
of these interventions are opposite and neutralizing when 
conjugated. Any augmentation of BDNF due to alleviation 
of distress would be neutralized by the negative effects of 
estradiol on BDNF in transsexuals.

Nevertheless, studying transsexuals may be subject 
to certain peculiarities compared with studying non-
transsexual individuals. The majority of neurobiological 
models of neuroactive steroids are tested in non-
transsexual individuals or in animals. The significance 
of this must be considered. There are indications that 
transsexual individuals respond differently to steroids 

than cissexuals do. For a long period of time, it was 
believed that the brain would be dimorphic in some 
aspects for men and women, with a type of intermediate 
variation of some structures for transsexuals,31 and 
estrogen exerts an effect on neuronal development.32 
Although new evidence of brain morphology and 
functional magnetic resonance imaging contest the idea 
of macroscopic dimorphisms across gender,33 we do not 
know exactly what happens microscopically in treatment 
with estradiol, an XY chromosome: Molecular responses 
might be “dimorphic.” There may be microscopic – beyond 
molecular – properties intrinsic to the sexual chromatin 
that dictate different responses between transsexual and 
non-transsexual individuals, e.g., the second messenger 
machinery and the neurokinin system.

 Increasing sample sizes to ensure that there 
BDNF serum levels are truly non-significant biologically, 
and not a result of our meager participant pool, would be 
advisable for forthcoming research.

Conclusion

Although this particular study has proven non-
significant, it has provided a critical inference: surgical 
solutions may not provide a quick fix for psychological 
distress associated with transsexualism. Although 
BDNF levels may be able to recover rapidly from acute 
trauma, it appears that transsexualism may require 
more extensive rehabilitation, in accordance with the 
hypothesis that the early and continual neurological 
effects of prejudice that transsexual patients suffer 
throughout their lives could be observed as continuous 
trauma that influences neuroplasticity, resulting from 
social vulnerability.34,35 These results have opened up 
avenues for more comprehensive research opportunities 
that could evaluate the association of BDNF levels in 
transsexualism. While ensuing studies will need to 
readdress confounding factors in this methodology, these 
results should allow for a more extensive and informed 
support system for medical interventions in transsexual 
individuals.
