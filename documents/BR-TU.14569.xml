SUMMARY

Salinity levels in soils of the Outer Coastal Plain of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil,
can be high, due to excess of Na in the irrigation water, evapotranspiration and soil
development from marine sediments.  The cultivation of irrigated rice could be an
alternative, since ion uptake as well as leaching by the establishment of a water
layer could mitigate the effects of soil salinity.  This study aimed to evaluate the
dynamics of basic cations in the solution of Albaqualf soils with different salinity
levels growing irrigated rice.  The plow layer contained exchangeable Na
percentages (ESP) of 5.6, 9.0, 21.2 and 32.7 %.  The plant stand, dry matter, Na, K
and Ca + Mg uptake at full flowering and grain yield were evaluated.  The levels of
Na, K, Ca + Mg and electrical conductivity (EC) in the soil solution were also
measured weekly during the rice cycle at four soil depths, in the water layer and
irrigation water.  The Na, K and Ca + Mg uptake by rice at full flowering was used
to estimate ion depletion from the layer under root influence.  Soil salinity induced
a reduction in the rice stand, especially in the soil with ESP of 32.7 %, resulting in
lower cation uptake and very low yield at that site.  As observed in the water layer
and irrigation water, the Na, K, Ca + Mg and EC levels in the soil solution decreased
with time at depths of 5, 10 and 20 cm, regardless of the original soil salinity, showing
that cation dynamics in the plow layer was determined by leaching and root uptake,
rather than by the effect of evapoconcentration of basic cations in the soil surface
layer.

Index terms: exchangeable sodium percentage, potassium, calcium, magnesium,
electrical conductivity.

RESUMO:         DINÂMICA DE CÁTIONS EM SOLOS COM DIFERENTES NÍVEIS
DE SALINIDADE, SOB CULTIVO DE ARROZ IRRIGADO

Solos da Planície Costeira Externa do Rio Grande do Sul podem conter altos níveis de
salinidade, devido à utilização de água para irrigação com excesso de Na, à evapotranspiração
e à gênese dos solos originários de sedimentos marinhos.  O cultivo do arroz irrigado pode ser
uma alternativa na mitigação da salinidade do solo, tanto pela absorção de íons quanto pela
lixiviação ocasionada pelo estabelecimento de uma lâmina de água.  Este trabalho teve o
objetivo de avaliar a dinâmica de cátions básicos na solução de solos com diferentes níveis de
salinidade sob cultivo de arroz irrigado.  O experimento foi conduzido em diferentes áreas com
Planossolo Háplico, com percentagens de saturação de Na (PST) da camada de 0–20 cm de
5,6; 9,0; 21,2; e 32,7 %.  Avaliaram-se o estande de plantas, a massa seca da parte aérea, a
absorção de Na, K, Ca + Mg no florescimento pleno e o rendimento de grãos.  Os teores de Na,
K, Ca + Mg e a condutividade elétrica (CE) na solução do solo em quatro profundidades, na
lâmina de água e na água de irrigação, foram mensurados semanalmente ao longo do ciclo do
arroz irrigado.  A absorção de Na, K e Ca + Mg pela cultura no florescimento pleno foi utilizada
para estimação da retirada de íons da camada sob influência das raízes.  A salinidade do solo
causou  redução do estande de plantas de arroz, sobretudo no solo com PST de 32,7 %, o que se
refletiu em menor absorção de cátions e produtividade ínfima nesse local.  Assim como observado
na lâmina de água e na água de irrigação, os teores de Na, K, Ca + Mg e a CE da solução do
solo nas profundidades de 5, 10 e 20 cm diminuíram com o desenvolvimento da cultura,
independentemente da salinidade original do solo, demonstrando que a dinâmica de cátions
na camada arável é determinada pela lixiviação e absorção radicular, em detrimento do efeito
da evapoconcentração de bases na camada superficial do solo.

Termos de indexação: percentagem de saturação por sódio, potássio, cálcio, magnésio,

INTRODUCTION

In Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, rice is grown in six
different regions in the Southern half of the State,
called Fronteira Oeste, Campanha, Depressão Central,
zona Sul and Planícies Costeiras Interna and Externa
(here Outer and Inner Coastal Plain).  The yield varies
regionally, although the applied technology levels are
basically the same.  On the Outer Coastal Plain, for
example, yields are lower compared to other regions,
and, in the 2008/09 growing season, the average yield
was 6.8 Mg ha-1 in an area of 128,760 ha, but
7.8 Mg ha-1 in an area exceeding 310,000 ha in
Fronteira Oeste (IRGA, 2009).  The discrepancies
observed between some regions may be attributed to
the different soil types (Streck et al., 2008), variation
in solar radiation (Mota, 1995; Custódio, 2007) and
region-specific stress, such as soil and water salinity.
In this context, the lagoon Laguna dos Patos is highly
important, because of its connection to the Atlantic
Ocean.  Laguna dos Patos is the main irrigation
source for rice crops in the coastal plains.  As a result,
the soils can be threatened by salt deposition at
incompatible levels for rice cultivation.

Aside from the salts in irrigation water, soil
salinization in Rio Grande do Sul can have other
causes.  On the Outer Coastal Plain, the soil is

constantly evolving as a result of marine and fluvio-
lacustrine sedimentation.  These sediments, which
may be more or less permeable, favor the groundwater
flow, providing a reaction zone where the freshwater
from the Laguna dos Patos and the salt water from
the sea flow together (Charette &amp;amp; Sholkovitz, 2006).
The brackish water level in the soil profile moves in
response to the seasonal water level of the Laguna
dos Patos and the hydraulic gradient of groundwater
(Niencheski et al., 2007).  At sites where the
groundwater is nearer the surface and depending on
the evaporation, salts can rise up to the plow layer.

Rice cultivation could be a viable alternative of
reducing soil salinity, provided that good quality water
is applied to the crop.  Although rice responds
sensitively to salinity in the seedling stage, with plant
stand reduction, and in the reproductive stage, with
spikelet sterility (Ehrler, 1960; Zeng &amp;amp; Shannon,
2000), the establishment of a water layer favors salt
leaching, especially Na, throughout the soil profile
(Ponnamperuma, 1981).  Moreover, the proper crop
uptake favors the removal of other salts from the
system, since irrigated rice is highly demanding in
K, Ca and Mg (Machado, 1983; Slaton et al., 2004).
Although the soil characteristics determine the
intensity of changes in the solution, the presence of
plants influences the process, either by nutrient

uptake, or by modifications in the rhizosphere, mainly
by oxygen flow in the aerenchyma and Fe3+
precipitation in the roots (Silva et al., 2003).  Grattan
et al. (2002), Boivin et al. (2002) and Schoenfeld et al.
(2007) reported an increase in salinity in the surface
layer to a depth of 10 cm, as an effect of
evapoconcentration.  Several factors may affect these
dynamics, e.g., soil texture, CEC, soil porosity and
depth of the impermeable layer, as well as the
experimental environment.  Therefore, the question
arises whether rice cultivation can potentially increase
or decrease soil salinity levels in the regions of the
state where the problem had already been reported.

This study aimed to monitor the influence of
irrigated rice cultivation on the dynamics of basic
cations and electrical conductivity in soils with
different salinity levels in the Outer Coastal Plain of
Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The study was carried out on the Fazenda
Cavalhada, in Mostardas, in the rice region called
Outer Coastal Plain (OCP), Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.
On the property, Albaqualf is the predominant soil
type (Streck et al., 2008) and rice has been grown for
the past 80 years.

Soils with different salinity levels in the plow layer
were selected.  Salinity was expressed as the
percentage of exchangeable Na percentage, according
to the equation: ESP (%) = [(Na + / CECpH 7.0)] x 100.
The sampling sites were selected based on the previous

analysis of eight cropping areas, with and without
history of salinity symptoms in rice plants,
characterized by low tillering and high spikelet sterility
(Ehrler, 1960).  At these sites, soil samples were taken
from stratified layers of 0–5, 5–10, 10–20 and 20–
40 cm in an area of 40 m2.  Ten sub-samples were
taken to form one composite sample per layer per site.
From these, four sites were selected with different
ESP in the 0–20 cm layer (Table 1).  Two areas were
chosen representing the extremes, one area with
intermediate ESP and one with high ESP.  The ESP
in the 0–20 cm layer of the selected sites was 5.6 %
(Casamento) where no salinity damage had been
reported, 9.0 % (Cavalhada), with a history of uneven
germination, but without spikelet sterility; 21.2 %
(Banhado), uneven germination and problems with
spikelet sterility, and 32.7 % (Sinval), sparse rice
germination, high spikelet sterility and very low
productivity.

The rice variety IRGA 417 was grown at three sites:
Cavalhada, Banhado and Sinval. In Casamento, to a
better control of red rice infestation, it was used the
variety IRGA 422 Clearfield®, which is an immediate
parental of IRGA 417 (Lopes et al., 1993) from which
it was derived in five backcrosses and therefore has
97 % of the traits of IRGA 417. Sowing dates were
November 1 (Cavalhada), November 8 (Banhado and
Sinval) and November 17, 2008 (Casamento).

The chemical attributes and clay content of soils
(Tedesco et al., 1995) are shown in table 1.  No basal
fertilization was applied, since the P levels were very
high at the four sites (SOSBAI, 2007) and K, a study
object, was not applied so as not to interfere with the
interpretation of results.  Only urea topdressing

(120 kg ha-1 N) was applied at the four sites prior to
irrigation, in V4.  Two sources of good water quality
were used: the Lagoa do Casamento (Cavalhada and
Casamento) and Lagoa dos Gateados (Banhado and
Sinval).  A water level of about 10 cm was maintained
in the paddy fields until grain harvest.  The
experiments were performed in 12 m² plots (4 x 3 m)
with a spacing of 0.5 m between plots and three
replications.  A rain gauge was installed at the
headquarters of the Fazenda Cavalhada,
approximately equidistant from the four experimental
areas.  The rainfall during the trial, in November
and December 2008; and January and February 2009,
is shown in table 2, which also contains the rainfall
data of the automatic weather station of the National
Institute of Meteorology (INMET) of the same period.
The maximum average rainfall in Mostardas was
presented for comparison, which is also valid for the
experimental areas, based on isohyets on basic climate
maps (averages of 30 years) as well as average rainfall
(11 years) in Tramandaí.  Mostardas and Tramandaí
are 84 and 63 km away from the headquarters of the
Fazenda Cavalhada, respectively.

Prior to irrigation in the experimental paddy fields,
soil solution collectors were installed at depths of 5,
10, 20, and 40 cm.  The equipment consisted of a plastic
hose (diameter 5 mm), connected to a collector PVC
tube (diameter 25 mm, length 40 mm), covered with
nylon mesh at the ends.  At the end of the hose surface,
approximately 40 mL solution per depth was extracted
with 60 mL syringes (Silva et al., 2003).  The aliquots
were immediately placed in plastic tubes with a
vacuum cap.  Sampling began on the seventh day
after irrigation started (7 DIS) until 91 DIS, in weekly
intervals between collections.  The water layer and
irrigation water were also sampled, until 84 DIS, when
irrigation was interrupted.  The electrical conductivity
(EC) of the samples was measured about four hours
after sampling.  Then the aliquots were acidified for
later analysis of Na, K, Ca, and Mg.

The stand of each site was evaluated when the
plants reached V4.  The number of plants in two 1 m-
long rows was counted.  To assess dry matter, plant
shoots were collected in 1 m segments, at full flowering
(FF), 77 DIS.  The plants were dried in a forced-air
oven for 72 h to determine dry matter and the Na, K,
Ca and Mg shoot levels, as well as ion uptake.  Grain
was harvested from an area of 5 m² (2 x 2.5 m) per
plot.  The material was processed in a stationary
thresher and the grain cleaned by sieving, weighed
and the grain mass corrected to 13 % moisture.

The data of the soil solution, water layer and
irrigation water were subjected to regression analysis.
The best-fitting polynomial equations were used.  The
significance of the regression coefficients was
presented at 10, 5 and 1 %, together with the
coefficients of determination.  To determine the ion
balance in the soil solution, as a function of plant
uptake, the ion concentrations of the soil solution 7

DIS was subtracted from the ion concentration 77
DIS, when full flowering coincided at the four sites.
The average ion concentrations at depths of 5, 10 and
20 cm were used, since about 90 % of the rice roots
are concentrated in the 0–20 cm layer (Lopes et al.,
1994; Teo et al., 1995; Abichequer, 2004).  Based on
the values of the ionic balance in the soil solution
between 7 and 77 DIS and of the ion uptake 77 DIS,
the ion leaching loss was determined by the difference
between these properties.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Plant stand, dry biomass at full flowering
and grain yield

In relation to the salinity levels evaluated, plant
establishment was best in Cavalhada, where the plant
stand was higher than in Casamento (Table 3), with
lowest levels of soil salinity (Table 1).  This may be
explained by the later sowing date in Casamento
(November 17, 2008), when soil moisture conditions
were unfavorable, unlike the situation in Cavalhada
(November 1, 2008), Banhado and Sinval (November
8, 2008).  The reduced establishment in Banhado and,
especially, in Sinval may be attributed to the higher
soil salinity at these sites than in Casamento and
Cavalhada (Table 1).  Several studies (Oster et al.,
1984; Shannon et al., 1998; Grattan et al., 2002)
reported a decrease in plant stand, proportional to the
salinity level in soil as well as irrigation water and
soil solution.

The dry matter yield at full flowering was highest
exactly at the lowest salinity level (Table 3).  However,
the higher yield in Banhado, at an ESP of 21.2 %,

compared to Cavalhada, where the ESP was 9.0 %,
was not expected.  Similarly to observations related
to the establishment, much less dry matter was
produced in Sinval than at the other locations (Table 3),
in response to the higher soil salinity (Table 1).  Data
related to grain yield are best related to the soil
salinity levels; the highest yield was obtained in
Casamento and the lowest in Sinval (Table 3).  At the
lowest salinity levels, productivity was very similar,
but in Banhado, although the plant stand was
consistent with high yield (Counce et al., 1989), grain
productivity was more than 1.0 Mg ha-1 lower,
compared to data observed in Casamento and
Cavalhada, which may reflect the ESP at that site
(Table 1), above the critical level of 20 % established
for rice (Fairhurst et al., 2007).

Ion dynamics in soil solution and plant
uptake

The Na contents in the soil solution (Figure 1),
similarly to the dry soil contents (Table 1), increased
with the soil salinity level and depth.  In general, soil
solution contents decreased with the crop growth,
except in Banhado (Figure 1c) at depths of 5 cm and
20 cm, where the Na content remained relatively
stable, with fluctuations over the rice cycle.  This
reduction in Na concentration over time was also
observed in the water layer (Figure 2a), which was
also directly influenced by the soil salinity level
(Table 1), since the irrigation water quality
(Figure 2b) was good (maximum Na levels around
0.3 cmolc L-1).  The Na levels in the water layer
decreased more intensely at the locations with initially
higher soil contents (Table 1) and became similar at
the end of the rice cycle.  The Na contents in the
water layer (Figure 2a) followed the same trend as in
the soil solution (Figure 1), demonstrating an
equilibrium relationship, determined by the interface
between the soil surface and water layer.  The
incidence of regular rainfall throughout the study
period, mainly in December 2008 and January and
February 2009, when rainfall was above average
(Table 2), may have caused the decrease, due to
dilution effect of Na in irrigation water at all sites
but Cavalhada (Figure 2b).

The physical action of roots increases permeability
and hydraulic conductivity in the soil, facilitating Na
leaching, which, together with the uptake of these
ions by rice, may have contributed to the decrease
during the rice cycle (McNeal et al., 1966), since a
partial replacement of K by Na may occur at the
uptake sites of rice roots (Castilhos et al., 1999).
Additionally, the high biological activity in the roots
increases CO2 concentration in the rhizosphere and,
together with the dissolution of native soil carbonates,
may have moved part of the Na present at the root
exchange sites, facilitating their output from the soil
layer influenced by the rhizosphere (Chhabra &amp;amp; Abrol,
1977).  Due to its high hydrated ionic radius, Na is a
cation easily leached by the water flow.

The difference between Na levels in the soil solution
7 DIS and 77 DIS was similar in Casamento,
Cavalhada and Banhado (Table 4).  The uptake of this
ion, however, was quite different at these three sites
and highest in Banhado (Table 4).  The lowest uptake
in Cavalhada can be partially explained by the lowest
dry matter yield at full flowering.  Despite this
discrepancy in Na uptake, the difference between the
ionic balance and Na uptake was positive and similar,
indicating that at these three sites, 55–68 mg L-1 Na
was lost through leaching, without even taking a
possible contribution of Na from the non-exchangeable
fraction to the soil solution into account.  In Sinval,
the Na content reached 520 mg L-1.  The highest
leaching at that site may have been stimulated by
the low Na uptake (Table 4), due to the low stand and
dry matter yield (Table 3), and the high soil salinity
(Table 1).

At a depth of 40 cm, the Na content in the soil
solution did not have standard performance at the
sites evaluated, because, over time, Na content
increased in Casamento (Figure 1a) and Banhado
(Figure 1c) and decreased in Sinval (Figure 1d).  In
Casamento and Banhado, the increased levels in deeper
layers may have been due to a rise of the brackish
water level or to Na leaching (Table 4), originated from
the surface horizons.  In the case of Sinval, the
decrease in Na at all depths may be due to leaching of
this ion to deeper layers, which can occur if the
impermeable layer, a common feature of Albaqualfs,
is located at a greater depth.

As no K fertilizer was added to the soil, the initial
levels (7 DIS) of this nutrient in the soil solution
(Figure 3) must result from an equilibrium state
between the cations of the soil (Table 1), since the
plants were still undeveloped.  In this situation, the
K content of the soil solution at different sites and
depths, relates to the Na content, which, due to mass
action, causes K displacement from exchange sites in
the soil.  However, throughout the rice cycle, the K
concentration in the soil solution (Figure 3) decreased
at all locations and depths.  The K content in the
water layer (Figure 4a) followed the same trend as
observed in the 5–20 cm layer, in Casamento,

Cavalhada and Banhado (Figure 3a-c), decreasing
during the vegetative and part of the reproductive
stage and increasing at physiological maturity.  This
increase cannot be attributed to the contribution of K

through irrigation water, in which K values were
lowest exactly at the end of the rice cycle (Figure 4b).
Potassium is not part of the structure of organic
compounds (Marschner, 1995), thus it is rapidly

depletion was more pronounced at a depth of 20 cm
from after the second sampling, 14 DIS (Figure 3).
Similar results were observed by Silva et al. (2003),
who studied the dynamics of cations of an Albaqualf
and a Gley soil, with and without rice plants, and
found a K decrease in the 0–10 cm layer, caused by
root uptake.

The apex of K depletion in the soil solution,
regardless of the original content in the soil, which
was highly variable (Table 1), occurred between 49
and 84 DIS, when K levels increased slightly
(Figure 3).  In that period, minimum values were null
for several weeks in the root growth layer (0–10 cm)
in Casamento (Figure 3a), Cavalhada (Figure 3b) and
Banhado (Figure 3c), where rice establishment was
not as severely affected (Table 3).

The difference in the amount of K between 7 and
77 DIS and the K uptake by plants was negative at
all sites (Table 4), indicating a contribution of non-
exchangeable K to plant nutrition, especially in areas
with higher growth (Casamento, Cavalhada and
Banhado - Table 3).  Despite the tiny plant stand in
Sinval, K uptake was also sufficient to contribute with
non-exchangeable K forms (Table 4).  Higher plants
have extremely efficient mechanisms to take up K,
even at low concentrations in the soil solution
(Gommers et al., 2005).  This generates a gradient
toward the roots, creating a favorable environment
for the release of non-exchangeable K forms, causing
a permanent buffering of exchangeable and non-
exchangeable K forms, adsorbed with both low and
high bond energy in the clay interlayers, or in primary
minerals (Kaminski et al., 2007).  Castilhos &amp;amp; Meurer
(2002) and Fraga et al. (2009) demonstrated the
contribution of non-exchangeable K forms to nutrition
of rice grown in pots with different soil types.  The
change of exchangeable to non-exchangeable K may
be rapid (Rosolem et al., 2006), especially when the K
concentration in the soil solution is very low.
However, the peak of K uptake by rice takes place
from the panicle differentiation, i.e., about 35 to 40 days
after the beginning of flooding in early-maturing
cultivars, and drops dramatically after full flowering
(Lopes et al., 1994).  Consequently, it would be expected
here that K levels in the soil solution would increase
as of 77 DIS, when the plants’ avidity for nutrients
decreases, which occurred only 84 DIS, a period that
coincides with the senescence phase of rice leaves
(Ookawa et al., 2003) and with rainfall (Table 2),
which allowed “K washing” from leaves.

Negative values for the difference between the K
amount in the soil solution in the 20 cm layer, and K
uptake by plants hinders K leaching in these soils,
contrary to what was observed with Na (Table 4).
However, the decrease in K concentration at all sites
at a depth of 40 cm (Figure 3), therefore out of reach
of most roots, suggests that there may have been K
leaching.  The data reported by Beltrame et al. (1991)
confirm this interpretation; the authors observed
cumulative K losses of 65.5 kg ha-1 in the 20–30 cm

recycled after leaf senescence.  Costa et al. (2009)
observed K accumulation in the vicinity of maize plants
and a proportional decrease of K concentration with
increasing distance from the sowing line, a behavior
known as “K washing” (Klepker &amp;amp; Anghinoni, 1995).
Thus, the element may have drained from the rice
tissues and deposited in the water layer.  This can be
proved by the dynamics of this nutrient at the site
with the highest salinity level (Sinval - Figure 4a),
where there was very little development of plants
(Table 3).  In this case, there was a slight increase in
K content in the water layer from 84 DIS (Figure 4a).
The increase of K in the water layer can also be
attributed to increased levels in the solution at the
end of the cycle (Figure 3), due to the equilibrium of
the water layer and the soil solution.

However, an increase of K concentration in the
soil solution was expected in the first weeks, because
of the biochemical changes caused by flooding.  After
irrigation, oxygen is rapidly consumed and the
anaerobic microorganisms use oxidised soil
compounds as electron acceptors, including nitrate
and iron and Mn oxides (Ponnamperuma, 1972).  The
soil solution composition would therefore change by
an increase of Fe2+, Mn2+ and NH4+ levels, causing a
displacement of other cations to the solution, such as
K (DeDatta, 1983), increasing the plant availability
and leaching losses, which are significantly higher
when the rice fields are continuously flooded (Santos
et al., 2002).  The presence of plants, however,
appeared to prevent this phenomenon, since K

layer over a period of 63 days after flooding, in an
Albaqualf with similar characteristics to the soils in
this study.

The initial Ca + Mg levels in the soil solution

(Figure 5), similar to K (Figure 3), are a result of the
equilibrium between cations, especially of Na, the
main determinant of the salinity degree in the soils
used in this study (Table 1).  The same was observed

with the cation contents during the crop cycle, with a
decrease in the soil solution at all sites, especially in
the soil layer to 20 cm under rhizosphere influence,
where a slight increase was observed at the end of the
rice cycle at the sites with lowest salinity: Casamento
(Figure 5a) and Cavalhada (Figure 5b).  These effects
were also observed in the water layer (Figure 6a) and
were not related to irrigation water (Figure 6b), in
which nutrient contents were similarly low and
unchanged throughout the rice cycle.

At the two sites with lowest soil salinity
(Casamento and Cavalhada), there was also an
increase in Ca + Mg concentrations in soil solution at
a depth of 40 cm (Figure 5a,b).  This may be due to
leaching from the upper layers, or to desorption of
Ca + Mg ions, caused by Fe2+ and Mn2+ replacement
at the exchange sites, as a result of redox reactions
caused by flooding (DeDatta, 1983).  Increasing the
Ca and Mg concentration in flooded soil solutions may
have been the cause of the negative values observed
for the difference between the amount of Ca + Mg in

the soil solution and plant uptake in Cavalhada and
especially in Casamento, where the uptake was much
higher than at the other sites (Table 4).

In a study performed in flooded Albaqualfs without
rice plants, Sousa et al. (2002) found an increase in
Ca and Mg in the soil solution until 35 DIS followed
by a decrease until stability.  Similar results were
obtained by Silva et al. (2003), with and without rice
plants.  However, both studies were performed in pots,
which prevented a downward hydraulic flow that could
leach these elements deeper, as shown by Santos et
al. (2002), in a field trial, at a depth of 60 cm.  Thus,
in the present study, it can be inferred that Ca and
Mg depletion (Figure 5) was mainly due to leaching,
since the highest losses were observed in the two areas
of highest salinity (Figure 5c,d).  The positive and
similar values of the difference between the amount
of Ca + Mg in solution and plant uptake, observed in
Banhado and Sinval, indicate a significant leaching
loss of Ca + Mg.  This is mostly due to the high levels
of these elements in the soil solution in the first days

of flooding (Figure 5c,d).  For being less required by
rice, the depletion of Ca and Mg in the soil solution
was less marked than of K, which virtually
disappeared from the soil solution in some cases
(Figure 3a,c).

The electrical conductivity (EC) of the soil solution,
determined by the ion concentration, especially of Na,
followed a similar trend to that of basic ions.  It
increased with the level of soil salinity (Table 1) and
decreased throughout the rice cycle at all sites, in the
0–20 cm soil layer (Figure 7).  At 40 cm depth, EC
decreased in the soil solution in Cavalhada and Sinval
(Figure 7b,d) and was constant in Casamento and
Banhado (Figure 7a,c).  Similar to the basic cations,
the EC of the water layer (Figure 8a) was related to
the EC of the soil solution, decreasing during the crop
cycle, proportionally to the soil salinity level, but not
to the EC of the irrigation water (Figure 8b).  The
small decrease in EC at two locations (Banhado and
Sinval) was probably due to a dilution effect caused
by regular rainfall (Table 2), as mentioned above.

The variable EC is used to monitor soil salinity,
due to the practicality of measurement and high
correlation with the amount of soluble salts, since it
represents the phenomenon of transfer of electric
current exerted by charged particles, ionic solutes
(cations and anions) and colloids on a force applied to
an electric field.  In general, the EC of soils increases
after flooding, reaching a maximum and decreasing
to stable values (Ponnamperuma, 1972).  This was
however not observed in this study, which reflects
the cation dynamics (Figures 1, 3 and 5) with generally
lower contents in the topsoil.  The reduction in EC
was most significant in the soil with highest salinity
(Sinval - Figure 7d), similar Na (Figure 1d).  In
Sinval, however, the EC levels remained above
3.0 dS m-1, a level considered harmful to rice (Ayers
&amp;amp; Westcot, 1985), at all depths.

Ion mobilization during the first weeks of flooding
causes an increase in EC, which varies according to
the soil type.  In soils with higher CEC, this process
tends to be stimulated.  Boivin et al. (2002), for example,
noted an increase in EC from 0.3 to 1.2 dS m-1, during
a rice cycle in a Vertisol, richer in cations than the
Albaqualf used in this study.  However, these authors
studied an African region characterized by a negative
annual water balance (2,000 mm), with average
rainfall of 280 mm in the rainy season (July-October)
during the rice cycle.  Rice cultivation in the low-
rainfall period may not allow the dilution of salts
contained in the irrigation and soil solution water.
This climate pattern is antagonistic to that observed
at the site in Mostardas, where rainfall was
distributed regularly throughout the experiment
(Table 2), favoring the reduction of EC in both the
water layer (Figure 8a) and irrigation water
(Figure 8b).  However, in both cases, the values were
similar at the end of the rice cycle.

In pot experiments, rice transpiration induces a
hydraulic gradient toward the roots, which mainly
governs the dynamics of soil EC, since plant
development causes a greater accumulation of ions in
the topsoil, due to the effect of evapoconcentration in
the rhizosphere.  This phenomenon usually occurs
near the period of panicle differentiation of rice, when
nutrient uptake is highest (Lopes et al., 1993).  In a
study on different soil types, including an Albaqualf,
Schoenfeld et al. (2007) observed a sharp EC increase
at depths of 5 and 10 cm 42 DIS, precisely because of
the increased transpiratory demand in this period.
Similar dynamics were observed by Sousa et al. (2002),
for K, Ca and Mg, 35 DIS.  In rice cultivated in pots
but with outflow of leachates, Chhabra &amp;amp; Abrol (1977)
found a drastic reduction in the salinity of a highly
salty soil, as in the present field study.  This showed

sites. *, **, ***: significant at 10, 5 and 1 %, by the F-test, respectively.

that water percolation and salt leaching, as well as
ion depletion by root uptake are more relevant than a
possible effect of nutrient concentration in the soil
surface layers, caused by plant transpiration.

CONCLUSIONS

1. Rice contributed to the depletion of Na, K, Ca
and Mg contents and, consequently, stimulated a

decrease of the electrical conductivity of the soil
solution in the rhizosphere, regardless of the original
soil salinity.

2. Root uptake and basic cation leaching influenced
the dynamics of basic cations in the soil solution in
the rhizosphere, more than the effects of nutrient
evapoconcentration.
