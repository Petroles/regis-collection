Mathematical models have great potential to support land use planning, with 
the goal of improving water and land quality.  Before using a model, however, 
the model must demonstrate that it can correctly simulate the hydrological and 
erosive processes of a given site.  the swat model (soil and water assessment 
tool) was developed in the United states to evaluate the effects of conservation 
agriculture on hydrological processes and water quality at the watershed scale.  
this model was initially proposed for use without calibration, which would 
eliminate the need for measured hydro-sedimentologic data.  in this study, the 
swat model was evaluated in a small rural watershed (1.19 km²) located on the 
basalt slopes of the state of rio grande do sul in southern Brazil, where farmers 
have been using cover crops associated with minimum tillage to control soil 
erosion.  Values simulated by the model were compared with measured hydro-
sedimentological data.  results for surface and total runoff on a daily basis were 
considered unsatisfactory (nash-sutcliffe efficiency coefficient – nse &amp;lt;0.5).  
however simulation results on monthly and annual scales were significantly 
better.  with regard to the erosion process, the simulated sediment yields for all 
years of the study were unsatisfactory in comparison with the observed values 
on a daily and monthly basis (nse values &amp;lt;-6), and overestimated the annual 
sediment yield by more than 100 %.

resUMo:     APLICABILIDADE DO MODELO SWAT NA SIMULAÇÃO HI-
DROSSEDIMENTOLÓGICA EM UMA PEQUENA BACIA HI-
DROGRÁFICA RURAL

Modelos matemáticos apresentam grande potencial para serem utilizados como 
instrumento de apoio ao planejamento de uso da terra, com o propósito de melhorar a 
qualidade do solo e da água.  A utilização de um modelo, no entanto, deve ser antecedida 
de uma etapa inicial, a fim de verificar o desempenho dele em simular corretamente os 
processos hidrológicos e erosivos de um dado local.  O modelo SWAT (Soil and Water 
Acesamente Tool) foi desenvolvido nos Estados Unidos para avaliar os efeitos da agricultura 
conservacionista sobre os processos hidrológicos e de qualidade de água na escala de bacia.  
Esse modelo foi inicialmente proposto para ser utilizado sem a necessidade de calibração, 
o que dispensaria o uso de dados hidrossedimentológicos medidos.  Nessa condição, o 
modelo SWAT foi avaliado em uma pequena bacia rural (1,19 km²) localizada nas encostas 
basálticas do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul, onde culturas de cobertura associadas com o 
cultivo mínimo vêm sendo empregadas pelos agricultores para controlar o processo erosivo.  
Valores simulados pelo modelo SWAT foram comparados com dados hidrossedimentológicos 
medidos.  Como resultado da simulação, verificou-se que o escoamento superficial e o total, 
para a escala de tempo diária, foram considerados insatisfatórios (valores de COE &amp;lt;0,5).  
Já as mesmas simulações para as escalas mensal e anual apresentaram resultados 
sensivelmente melhores.  Com relação ao processo erosivo, verificou-se para todos os anos 
que a produção de sedimentos simulada, quando comparada com os valores observados, foi 
insatisfatória para as simulações diárias e mensais (valores de COE &amp;lt;-6) e superestimou 
em mais de 100 % a produção de sedimentos anual.

Termos de indexação: manejo do solo, erosão hídrica, produção de sedimentos, modelo

introdUction

Mathematical models have been used to assist 
in planning improvements in soil and water 
conservation practices (arnold et al., 1999; Jha 
et al., 2006; Borah et al., 2006).  to perform these 
functions, however, the models must be able to 
simulate hydrologic processes as well as track the 
transference of sediments and pollutants to the 
drainage network.

among the several mathematical models 
currently in use, the swat model stands apart 
(arnold et al., 1998; arnold &amp;amp; fohrer, 2005).  this 
model has been widely used with good results, both 
in the U.s. and elsewhere in the world, to evaluate 
the effects of land use and soil management on 
hydrology, sediment yield (ceaP, 2010) and water 
quality (Borah et al., 2006; Benham et al., 2006).  in 
Brazil, the swat model has great potential to be 
used as a support tool for planning an appropriate 
land use to improve water quality.  Potential 
applications would be by watershed committees, 
for water resource management, water supply 
companies (Minoti, 2006) and for hydroelectric 
power generation projects (andriolo et al., 2008).

the swat model (arnold et al., 1998; arnold &amp;amp; 
fohrer, 2005) was initially developed to be applied 

to ungauged basins (gassman et al., 2007).  this 
means that the swat model could be applied 
without calibration since this step implies the need 
for good quality hydro-sedimentological monitoring 
data (consistent time series).  this information is 
quite rare in the world, except in the U.s. and some 
european countries.

the United states department of agriculture 
(Usda) together with american universities 
developed the swat model based on a comprehensive 
database (Burford &amp;amp; clark, 1973) from gauged 
basins in that country.  therefore, for american 
conditions, the simulation could be performed 
without the need for calibration.  while the 
possibility of using a model without calibration 
may be appealing, it is unlikely that a model would 
be able to perform adequate hydro-sedimentolgical 
simulations in regions other than those for which 
the model was developed.  the best way to assess 
the performance of a mathematical model at a given 
location is by comparing simulated results with 
actual monitoring data.

in Brazil, the swat model has been used to 
assess the effects of different land use and soil 
management scenarios on hydrology and sediment 
yield (oliveira et al., 1999; Machado &amp;amp; Vettorazzi, 
2003; Baldissera, 2005; Moro et al., 2005; Prado

et al., 2006; Minoti, 2006; adriolo et al., 2008).  
however, studies where the simulated data are 
compared to the observed data, based on situations 
where the model was applied with and without 
calibration, are rarely found.  this study aimed to 
evaluate the efficiency and limitations of the swat 
model without calibration to simulate different 
time scales (daily, monthly and annual), runoff and 
sediment yield.

Materials and Methods

study area description

the 1.19 km² rural watershed used for this study 
is located in southern Brazil, in the municipality 
of arvorezinha, in the northeastern region of the 
state of rio grande do sul (28° 52’ 10” s and 52° 
10’ 30” w).  water and sediment discharge drain 
through the lajeado ferreira brook which is a 
tributary of the guaporé river (taquari-antas 
basin).  according to the Köppen classification, the 
arvorezinha watershed is inserted in a cfb climate 
region – temperate, super humid, mesothermal 
climate with cool summers and frequent severe 
frosts.  the average daily temperature of the 
warmest month is below 22 °c, and of the coolest 
month is over 3 °c.  annual rainfall varies from 1250 
to 2000 mm, and is well distributed throughout the 
year, without a defined dry or rainy season (nimer, 
1990).

topography ranges from flat to mountainous.  
Basalt is the common parent soil material, from 
which soils such as Ultisols, entisols and cambisols 
were formed according to the relief (embrapa, 
2006).  the native vegetation consists of subtropical 
Brazilian atlantic rainforest.

hydro-sedimentological monitoring

five rain gauges were installed in the arvorezinha 
watershed.  to monitor water flow at the outlet, 
a Parshall flume was built with a level sensor/ 
levellogger to continuously record the water 
level.  the suspended sediment load discharge 
is determined by the product of the flow rate (Q) 
and the suspended sediment concentration (ssc), 
the latter obtained manually using an isokinetic 
sediment hand sampler U.s. dh-48 (edwards &amp;amp; 
glysson, 1998), which determines the ssc by the 
evaporation method (guy, 1969).  sediment yield 
(sy) is calculated by relating the sediment load 
discharge with the duration of each event (Minella 
et al., 2008).  details of monitoring, separation of 
surface runoff from total flow discharge (baseflow 
+ runoff) obtained by an observed hydrograph, 
climatic data and observed sediment load discharge 

were described by Uzeika (2009).  the observed 
data used to compare the values simulated by the 
swat model correspond to the monitoring series 
from 2002 to 2006.

input soil parameters used in the model were 
measured in the entire watershed, considering 
the different land uses and soil managements 
(dalbianco, 2009).

Using the swat Model

the swat model (arnold et al., 1998; arnold &amp;amp; 
fohrer, 2005) is a hydro-sedimentologic model at the 
watershed scale, usually applied in continuous-time 
simulations that can be discretized in monthly, daily 
and sub-daily scales.  thus, the input data to feed the 
model must be adjusted to the spatial and temporal 
dynamics of the processes occurring in the target 
watershed.  the input data (cartographic databases 
– data layers and tabular data) are inserted through 
an appropriate interface.  the required layers are: 
digital elevation model (deM); soil type; land use/
management, and watershed limits.  the interface 
developed between swat and arcgis®, in addition 
to facilitating data input in the model, automatically 
subdivides the watershed into sub-sections based 
on the deM and the drainage network, and then 
lists the input data for each sub-watershed.  this 
interface also enables the display of the model 
output data as maps, charts and tables.

the relief of the watershed was obtained by 
georeferencing and scanning of topographic maps 
(Brasil, 1979), scale 1:50.000, with 20 m intervals 
between the topographic contour lines.  Using the 
arcview® topogrid tool, contour lines were inferred 
(hutchinson, 1996), generating the numerical 
terrain model (Mnt) with altitudes ranging from 
560 to 750 m asl.  By applying the swat model, 
the arvorezinha watershed was subdivided into 
three sub-basins.  the criterion for the subdivision 
was a minimum area of 6 ha.  thus, the model 
automatically sets the confluences that delimit areas 
greater than those specified by the user.

land use and soil management data over five years 
were used, but the different uses and delineation of 
plots invalidated the continuous simulation of five 
years of data.  this occured because the swat model 
only allows for the entry of one land use and soil 
management map.  therefore, each year was simulated 
separately.  land use and soil management maps 
were obtained from annual surveys, with the aid of 
a gPs with an accuracy of ± 20 m.  all fields in the 
watershed were included in these surveys and use 
and management data for each area were collected.  
then the data were entered into arcgis® and later 
into swat.  details of all procedures employed in 
the use of the swat model related to this article 
were described in detail by Uzeika (2009).

table 1 shows the main land uses and soil 
management in the arvorezinha watershed for the 
five years of simulated data and changes in land use 
and soil management.

for the simulations performed annually without 
calibration, data from the two years before the 
evaluated year was used.  this strategy was used 
for model warming (stability) during the interactive 
procedures to obtain results.  to validate the model, 
the nash-sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (nse) was 
used (nash &amp;amp; sutcliffe, 1970), as this statistic has 
been widely used in validation of the swat model 
(gassman et al., 2007).

resUlts and discUssion

Between 2004 and 2008, a number of agricultural 
practices of soil and water conservation (cover crops 
combined with minimum tillage) were introduced 
by rural extension agents.  these practices were 
then gradually adopted by farmers, resulting in a 
reduction in erosion and sediment yield (Minella et 
al., 2008) and improved soil quality.

suface and total runoff

table 2 shows the values of the nse for daily 
and monthly runoff simulations and the total flow 
discharge for the five years of simulation.  the nse 
values for daily runoff were unsatisfactory for all 
years of simulation.  the daily simulations of total 
flow discharge were slightly higher, but the nse 
values show a low relation between the simulated 
and observed values.  the main limitation of swat 
to represent the variables on a daily scale is related 
to the short, rapid rainfall events that occur in small 
headwater watersheds (Minella et al., 2011).  these 

events are characterized by complex hydrographs 
that are highly dependent on rainfall characteristics.  
on a monthly scale, the errors, both over and under-
estimated, are compensated, resulting in a better fit 
with the observed values.

the nse values may vary from - ? to 1.  a perfect 
fit between simulated and observed values (slope = 
1 and the independent term = 0) was attributed to 
the value 1.  a negative nse value indicates that the 
mean values observed predict more adequately than 
the model used (nash &amp;amp; sutcliffe, 1970).  Moriasi 
et al. (2007) suggested that a nse greater than 
0.50 should be considered suitable for hydrologic 
simulations in terms of monthly time scales, while 
for the daily scale this value could be slightly lower, 
and necessarily higher than 0.50 when considering 
the annual time scale.

nse runoff simulation values are more realistic 
on a monthly scale than when compared on a daily 
scale, with the exception of 2004, when the nse 
value was extremely low (0.02).  in total monthly 
runoff simulations, nse values were also higher 
when compared to the daily values.  the nse values 
for simulations of total flow discharge in 2004 were 
significantly worse than in other years, which may 
be due to a smaller volume of rainfall that year 
(table 2).  in monthly flow discharge simulations 
for 2006, which was also a year with a below-
average rainfall, this trend was also confirmed.  for 
that same year, however, the total flow discharge 
simulation showed a satisfactory nse value (0.79).  
the fact that the model adequately simulated 
total monthly flow discharge, without calibration, 
shows a positive aspect of swat.  however it is 
also worth mentioning that or the total rainfall, the 
hydrograph separation line of rainfall excess (runoff) 
from baseflow is a complex process associated with 
great uncertainty.  this is due to a significant 
interflow (lateral water flow that returns to the land

or stream without first reaching groundwater) in 
the stormflow.  in the arvorezinha watershed the 
interflow is caused by the presence of shallow soils 
with textural gradient associated with planting 
ridges in tobacco fields.

figure 1 illustrates the monthly total flow discharge 
simulations.  for this graph, the consistency between 
rainfall and total flow discharge at the monthly scale 
is good, indicating the adequate water transfer from 
the watershed to the fluvial channel.  another aspect 
observed is the model’s tendency to underestimate 
the total flow discharge in wetter years (2002) and 
to overestimate it in drier years (2004).

overall, for both runoff and total flow discharge, 
studies reported that swat presents low nse 
values for daily simulations, regardless of calibration 
(gassman et al., 2007).  factors such as inadequate 
representation of the spatial variability of rainfall 
data (cao et al., 2006), lack of calibration (Bosch et 
al., 2004), errors in water discharge measurement 
(harmel et al., 2006) and a short observation period 

have been cited to justify this condition.  gassmann 
et al. (2007) analyzed the performance of the swat 
model using data from 115 papers published in 
different parts of the world.  in this article, for 
the work carried out in small watersheds (under 
30 km2), nse values for total flow discharge and 
runoff simulations on a daily scale were also low 
(below 0.5).  however for hydrological simulations 
at the monthly scale, nse values were appropriate, 
independent of whether the model had been 
calibrated or not.  this shows that the results of the 
hydrological simulations carried out in this study are 
consistent with other evaluations of swat.  another 
important aspect observed in the work of gassmann 
et al. (2007) refers to the relationship between the 
watershed area and the nse value.  higher nse 
values were observed in larger watersheds, which 
can be justified by the difficulty of simulating small 
watersheds.  in general, small watersheds have low 
concentration time and low capacity to minimize the 
peak runnoff, similar to what was observed in the 
arvorezinha watershed.

sediment yield simulation

the swat model estimates the sediment input 
using the Modified Universal equation for soil loss- 
MUsle (williams &amp;amp; Berndt, 1977).  this equation 
uses the same parameters as the Universal soil loss 
equation - Usle (wischmeier &amp;amp; smith, 1978), except 
for the erosivity factor (r factor) which in MUsle is 
replaced by the product of the volume of the runoff 
(m3) and the runoff peak (m3 s-1) of stormflow.  when 
the runoff, along with the sediment load (mass of 
sediment mobilized by erosion), reaches the fluvial 
channel, the propagation phase of these sediments 
in the drainage network begins.  the sediment yield 
or load refers to the total amount of sediment that 
exits a drainage basin over a given period of time.

table 3 shows the nse values for daily and 
monthly sediment yield simulations.  Unlike 
observed for both surface and total runoff, nse 
values indicate that the model was not able to 
reproduce the estimated daily and monthly sediment 
yield adequately for each evaluated year.  in general, 
the swat model significantly overestimated 
sediment yield for both time scales.

table 4 shows the comparison of annual sediment 
yield simulations with the observed values.  
sediment yield values were overestimated for all 
years, especially for 2006.  considering the average 
simulated and observed sediment yield values, the 
results indicate a 5-fold overestimation.

gassmann et al. (2007) report a series of data 
on sediment yield simulated by swat in various 
watersheds worldwide.  for small watersheds, 
with the exception of one study (Muleta &amp;amp; nicklow, 
2005), observed nse values have shown that the 
model could adequately simulate sediment yield on 
daily, monthly and yearly time scales.  in addition, 
in two citations where swat was not calibrated 
(Machado &amp;amp; Vettorazzi, 2003; tripathi et al., 2003), 
nse values were also adequate (nse &gt; 0.5).

Viero et al. (2009), working in the arvorezinha 
watershed and using the wateM/sedeM model 

(Van oost et al., 2000) found that this model 
overestimated the sediment yield between 16 and 
150 times, when compared with observed values.  
the authors attributed the results to two limiting 
factors: the low quality of the deM, which did 
not allow for an adequate representation of the 
microtopography of the watershed surface, and also 
due to the fact that the wateM/sedeM model does 
not simulate the erosion process that occurs in the 
fluvial channel.

factors related to the overestimation of sedi-
ment yield

as previously mentioned, the results for sediment 
yield obtained in this study (tables 3 and 4) were 
different from those results reported by gassmann 
et al. (2007).  hydrological results simulated by 
swat on the daily scale showed limitations when 
used for small watersheds without calibration.  the 
response to rainfall in the arvorezinha watershed 
is characterized by a rapidly evolving hydrological 
process, with erosion within few hours between 
the beginning of runoff and the falling limb of 
the hydrograph.  thus, the proper representation 
of the hydrological process of a small watershed 
would be linked to the model ability to simulate 
this condition.  the time of concentration, the slope 
of the falling limb of the hydrograph and runoff 
volume are key features to be incorporated into 
the hydrologic simulation of small watersheds, to 
ensure an adequate simulation of sediment yield.  
as mentioned, the results of daily runoff simulations 
were not satisfactory, which indicates mainly that 
the estimation of the runoff by the model was not 
correct for the daily scale, since the rainfall events 
occur on a sub-daily time-scale.

another important aspect to be considered is the 
simplification of the ls factor in swat calculations.  
the ls factor is calculated automatically from the 
deM for each hydrological response unit (hrU) 
as follows: l represents the distance between the 
extreme points of hrU, while s is based on the

difference between the heights of these points.  the 
use of extremes for each hrU certainly results in an 
increase of the ls factor value, hence overestimating 
sediment yield.  this simplified way of calculating 
the ls factor does not consider sediment deposition 
between the extreme points and may represent a 
major source of errors in the results observed in 
this work.

Minella et al. (2010), comparing different 
procedures for calculating the ls factor in the 
arvorezinha watershed, found important differences 
between simplified methods and methods that 
take into account the spatial representation of 
a watershed area.  the swat model would be 
more robust in its estimation of sediment yield if 
the ls factor could be replaced by methods that 
consider the spatial representation of the area of a 
watershed, according to the procedures proposed by 
Moore &amp;amp; Burch (1986) or desmet &amp;amp; govers (1996).  
Benatto et al. (2006) used Usle and a sediment 
delivery ratio (sdr) based on the watershed area 
to calculate sy for the arvorezinha watershed, 
where the ls factor was estimated using the 
computational procedure proposed by Moore &amp;amp; 
Burch (1986).  results obtained were consistent 
with the observed sediment yield in the watershed, 
which indicates that the Usle base for MUsle 
used in swat has the potential to simulate the 
erosion processes, as long as the complexity of the 
ls factor is adequately represented and adjusted 
as a parameter of sediment emission, similar to 
the sdr.

an important consideration is also with regard 
to the process of transport of river sediment to the 
fluvial channel.  a positive aspect of the swat 
model is that it considers that the processes in 
the drainage basin are linked with those that 
occur in the fluvial channel.  on the other hand, 
the complexity of the processes occurring in the 

fluvial channel is simplified by the swat model 
(gassmann et al., 2007).  for example, when 
simulating sediment yield in an hrU, which in 
turn is contained in a sub-basin, the entire sediment 
load mobilized in the Urh is transferred to the 
fluvial channel.  this rarely occurs in reality, 
because a significant proportion of the sediment 
is deposited between the drainage basin and the 
fluvial channel.  in the case of the arvorezinha 
watershed, Moro (2011) calibrated the distributed 
erosion model liseM (limburg soil erosion Model), 
and found significant sediment deposition of eroded 
material at the base of the slopes.  Using the cs-137 
technique in the same watershed, Minella found 
that from the total sediment load that is mobilized 
in the watershed, only 40 % is transferred to the 
fluvial channel.  thus, a possible source of error 
in estimating the observed sediment yield for the 
arvorezinha watershed is related to the inability of 
the model to simulate the process occurring between 
the area of sediment deposition and the fluvial 
channel.  in general, the deM available for small 
watersheds are still quite limited in representing 
the relief adequately and thereby erosion modeling, 
especially of depositions.

another important factor to be considered 
is the need for model calibration.  in the U.s., 
where the model was developed from a large and 
representative set of experimental watersheds, the 
developers of the model suggest that it may be used 
without calibration.  however, results obtained in 
this work indicate that for different climatic and 
physiographic conditions without calibration, the 
simulation may produce unsatisfactory results.

this is especially important for small watersheds 
where the processes of generating surface and erosive 
runoff are non-linear.  at daily intervals, the swat 
model is unable to represent the complexity and 
magnitude of the hydrographs and sedimentographs

during an event.  however on monthly and annual 
scales, daily values are added up, and the errors 
compensate each other, generating a better fit with 
the observed values.

therefore, calibration minimizes the errors from 
the simplified simulation of the processes being 
modeled.  this reinforces the need to expand the 
Brazilian hydro-sedimentological research network 
at the watershed scale so that mathematical 
modeling may be used as a more accurate means of 
planning an appropriate use of natural resources.

conclUsions

1. the swat model, when used without 
calibration, was able to adequately reproduce runoff 
and total flow discharge on monthly and annual time 
scales but not on daily scales.

2. sediment yield simulations were overestimated 
for all time scales (daily, monthly and annual) and 
throughout the entire simulated period.

3. factors such as the use of swat without 
calibration, and the model’s limitations in 
representing the hydrological and sedimentological 
processes for small watersheds could be responsible 
for these results.
