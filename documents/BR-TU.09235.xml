RESUMO 
 

REYES, Rafael Ignacio Quezada, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, julho de 2017. 
Ultrafiltracão e electrocoagulação de filtrados do branqueamento de uma fábrica 
de polpa celulósica kraft para fins de reúso. Orientador: Claudio Mudadu Silva. 
 

Devido ao contínuo aumento das restrições ambientais em fábricas produtoras 

de polpa celulósica, a indústria tem procurado encontrar opções para minimizar 

o consumo de água, aumentar o reúso da água e melhorar a qualidade do 

efluente final. O tratamento de correntes líquidas setoriais da fábrica pode ser 

uma alternativa técnica e economicamente atrativa por possuírem baixos 

volumes e altas concentrações quando comparados ao efluente final que 

consiste na mistura de todos os efluentes da fábrica. Em estudos anteriores, foi 

determinada a viabilidade de utilizar ultrafiltração para o tratamento do efluente 

alcalino do setor de branqueamento da fábrica. O primeiro objetivo desse estudo 

foi avaliar o reúso do permeado gerado e a disposição do concentrado no ciclo 

de recuperação química. Os resultados indicaram que é possível substituir 100% 

da água quente na prensa (EPO) sem gerar incrustações de carbonato de cálcio 

e hidróxido de magnésio. De acordo com a caraterização do concentrado, 

estima-se que é possível a disposição do concentrado na área de evaporadores 

sem aumentar o risco de formação de incrustações ou afetar o funcionamento 

da caldeira de recuperação. O segundo objetivo foi determinar a viabilidade 

técnica de tratar o efluente ácido do setor de branqueamento com membranas 

de ultrafiltração e avaliar mediante simulações por software a viabilidade de 

reusar o permeado, a formação de incrustações de sulfato de bário e os efeitos 

na estação de tratamento de efluentes da fábrica. Os resultados indicaram que 

é possível tratar o filtrado ácido com membranas de ultrafiltração, a remoção de 

matéria organica e cor foi de 65% e 82% respetivamente. A simulação por 

software indicou que a de substituição de 25% da água branca na prensa do 

primeiro estagio D pelo permeado, aumenta em 10% o risco de formação de 

incrustações de sulfato de bário. Neste caso o efluente final da fábrica possuiria 

uma carga de DQO 38% menor e a geração de lodo biológico diminuiria em 40%. 

O terceiro objetivo foi avaliar o tratamento de eletrocoagulação com eletrodos de 

ferro e alumínio, dos efluentes ácido e alcalino, determinar a viabilidade técnica 

de reusar os efluentes tratados e determinar os efeitos na estação de tratamento 

de efluentes (ETE). Os resultados indicaram que tanto para o efluente ácido 



vi 
 

como para o efluente alcalino, a maior remoção de DQO foi obtida com o 

tratamento de eletrocoagulação com eletrodos de alumínio, 51% e 48% 

respectivamente. Pelas características finais dos efluentes tratados, conclui-se 

que os mesmos podem substituir a água quente na prensa (EPO) sem aumentar 

o risco de formação de incrustações de carbonato de cálcio. A substituição da 

água quente pelo efluente tratado diminui o consumo de água em 7,5 m3 por 

tonelada de polpa seca.

ABSTRACT 
 

REYES, Rafael Ignacio Quezada, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de Viçosa, July, 2017. 
Ultrafiltration and electrocoagulation of bleaching filtrates from a kraft pulp mill 
for reuse porpuses. Adviser: Claudio Mudadu Silva. 
 

Due to the continuous rise of environmental concern of the pulp industry, it is 

necessary to find options that minimize the water consumption, and enhance 

effluent quality. The treatment of specific in-plant stream seems to be an 

attractive technical and economical approach because of the smaller amount of 

effluent to be treated compared with the total final effluent volume. Previous 

studies have shown that it is possible to treat alkaline extraction (EPO) effluent 

with ultrafiltration membranes. The first objective of this study was to evaluate the 

reuse of the ultrafiltration (UF) permeate and the transfer of the retentate to the 

chemical recovery cycle. The results showed that it was possible to replace 100% 

of the hot water in the (EPO)-press without generating scaling of calcium 

carbonate or magnesium hydroxide. According to the characteristics of the 

retentate, it is assumed that it is possible to transfer the UF-retentate to the 

evaporator area without increasing the risk of fouling or negatively affecting the 

operation of the recovery boiler. The second objective was to evaluate the 

feasibility of the bleaching plant acidic effluent ultrafiltration membrane treatment 

and study, using software simulations, the feasibility of reusing the permeate 

determining  the risk of barium sulfate scaling and the effects on the final effluent 

treatment plant. The results indicated that it was possible to treat the acidic 

effluent with UF membranes, the removal of COD and color was 65% and 82%, 

respectively. Software simulation indicated that the 25% replacement of white 

water in the first D-stage press would increase by 10% the risk of barium sulfate 

formation. The final total effluent of the mill decreased by 38% of the COD load 

and the biological sludge generation decreased by 40%. The third objective was  

evaluating the electrocoagulation treatment with iron and aluminum electrodes of 

acidic and alkaline bleaching plant effluents, to determine the technical feasibility 

of reusing the treated effluents and to determine the effects on the effluent 

treatment plant. The results indicated that for both, acidic and alkaline effluent, 

the highest COD removal was achieved with the electrocoagulation treatment 

with aluminium electrodes, 51% and 48%, respectively. Due to the pH and 



viii 
 

composition of the treated effluents, both treated effluents could replace hot water 

in the (EPO) press without increasing the risk of calcium carbonate scale 

formation. The substitution of hot water by treated effluent reduced water 

consumption by 7.5 m3 / ADt.

INTRODUÇÃO GERAL 
 

O setor produtivo de polpa celulósica e papel consome um alto volume de 

água e devido ao constante aumento de sua demanda está perto de se 

transformar em um bem limitado em alguns países. A diminuição na 

disponibilidade da água gerou necessidade de redução do seu consumo  através 

de práticas de controle preventivo da poluição pela modificação dos processos 

fabris. 

O elevado consumo de água em processos industriais representa um 

grande problema para a indústria de polpa celulósica e papel, principalmente 

pelo elevado custo do tratamento dos efluentes gerados e tamanho dos 

equipamentos a serem utilizados (THOMPSON et al., 2001). Existem duas 

maneiras de resolver este problema: o tratamento geral destes efluentes, 

chamado de “tratamento de fim de tubo” ou, reduzir ou eliminar a geração na 

fonte, pelo procedimento de minimização do consumo de água através do reúso 

de correntes internas. 

Em circuitos fechados, onde é realizado intenso reúso da agua, diversos 

elementos químicos, denominados de elementos não-processáveis (ENP), são 

acumulados até atingir níveis de saturação no meio, podendo originar sérios 

problemas no processo e prejudicar a qualidade do produto final. As 

consequências mais comuns são a perda da qualidade da polpa branqueada, 

devido à presença de depósitos e entupimento de equipamentos e tubulações, 

com a consequente perda de eficiência do processo produtivo (SAIF et al., 2013; 

HUBER et al., 2014). 

Tendências no tratamento de efluentes industriais, indicam que é mais 

adequado e conveniente, a implementação de medidas de tratamento em 

correntes líquidas internas da fábrica antes que elas sejam reutilizadas. As 

principais vantagens desta estratégia é a redução do volume do efluente a ser 

tratado e o menor tamanho dos equipamentos a serem utilizados, por 

conseguinte, menores custos de tratamento (BERUBE &amp;amp; HALL, 2000; KOSSAR, 

2013; QUEZADA et al., 2014). 

O branqueamento da polpa celulósica é a etapa, dentro do processo de 

fabricação de polpa Kraft, que gera o maior volume de efluentes. Uma sequência 

de branqueamento de polpa Kraft de eucalipto comumente utilizada tem sido 

D(EPO)DD, ou seja, um estágio com dióxido de cloro (D) seguido por extração 



2 
 

alcalina reforçada com peróxido de hidrogênio e oxigênio (EPO), seguido por 

outros dois estágios com dióxido de cloro. 

Existem várias técnicas testadas para tratar o efluente gerado no 

branqueamento da polpa kraft (SEMPERE et al., 2002; MOUNTEER et al., 2007; 

QUEZADA et al., 2014). Nos últimos anos as tecnologias eletroquímicas, tais 

como eletrocoagulação, eletroflotação e eletrooxidação, tem sido utilizadas para 

o tratamento de efluentes (CHEN, 2004; VALENTE et al., 2012; PULKKA et al., 

2014). Entre esses métodos, se destaca a eletrocoagulação como uma técnica 

promissora devido às suas características únicas: elevada degradação de 

poluentes, menor geração de lodo e facilidade na operação (ZAIED &amp;amp; 

BELLAKHAL, 2009; SRIDHAR et al., 2011). 

Por outro lado, há alguns anos, tem-se empregado a tecnologia de 

filtração com membranas para o tratamento da água e/ou aguas residuais. 

Atualmente, essa tecnologia é aplicada e se mostra viável para o tratamento de 

diferentes tipos de efluentes. A filtração por membranas pode ser classificada 

dependendo do diâmetro médio dos poros como: microfiltração (MF) ( 10 – 100 

µm), ultrafiltração (UF) (2 - 100 nm), nanofiltração (NF) (500 - 2.000 g/mol) e 

osmose inversa (OI) (&amp;lt;500 g/mol) (MÄNTTÄRI et al.,; KASHER, 2009; MURO, 

2012; QUEZADA et al., 2014). 

Existem programas de simulação de processos industriais que realizam 

balanços de massa bastante próximos dos processos industriais. Dentre esses 

programas, destaca-se o WinGEMS, largamente utilizado para simulações de 

unidades do processo de produção de polpa celulósica e papel (DIONÍSIO et al., 

2010). O software WinGEMS não tem capacidade de realizar cálculos de 

formação de incrustações, dado importante para definir estratégias de reúso de 

efluentes. Para determinar o potencial de formação de incrustações diversos 

pesquisadores incorporam os modelos cinéticos de formação de sais ao software 

(LITVAY et al., 2003; WADSBORN, 2011; WADSBORN &amp;amp; RÅDESTRÖM, 2011). 

O objetivo geral deste estudo foi avaliar o uso de membranas de ultrafiltração 

da eletrocoagulação no tratamento de efluentes gerados no branqueamento da 

polpa celulósica Kraft. 

O primeiro capítulo trata do reúso do permeado do tratamento de ultrafiltração 

do efluente alcalino do setor de branqueamento e o envio do concentrado no 

ciclo de recuperação química.

O segundo capítulo trata do tratamento do filtrado ácido com membranas de 

ultrafiltração, o reúso do permeado dentro do setor de branqueamento e os 

efeitos na estação de tratamento de efluentes (ETE). 

O terceiro capítulo aborda o tratamento de electrocoagulação com eletrodos 

de ferro e alumínio dos efluentes ácido e alcalino, o reúso do efluente tratado e 

os efeitos na ETE.

CAPITULO 1: REUSE OF ULTRAFILTRATION MEMBRANE PERMEATE 
AND RETENTATE OF (EPO) FILTRATES FROM A KRAFT PULP MILL 

BLEACHING PLANT

ABSTRACT 

An oxygen- and peroxide-reinforced extraction stage (EPO) filtrate from a kraft 

pulp mill bleach plant was treated using an ultrafiltration (UF) membrane 

separation process that generates a permeate stream and a retentate stream. 

The feasibility of the UF permeate reuse in an (EPO) washing press was 

evaluated. According to the WinGEMS steady-state software simulation, 100% 

replacement of hot water with permeate was possible without critical 

accumulation of non-process elements (NPE) or CaCO3 and Mg(OH)2 scaling 

formation during the softwood and hardwood campaigns. The feasibility of 

membrane retentate reuse in the black-liquor recovery cycle (prior to evaporation) 

was also evaluated. The results showed a negligible increase in the load of critical 

elements in the weak black liquor. Therefore, no scaling formation or negative 

effect on the performance of the recovery boiler is expected. 

 

Keywords: (EPO) effluent, membrane treatment, pulp mill effluent, simulation,

INTRODUCTION 
 

The pulp and paper industry is the largest consumer of water among the 

industrial activities of the countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation 

and Development (OECD). Since 1980, water pollution from the pulp and paper 

sector has been significantly reduced in most OECD paper-producing countries. 

Pulp mills all over the world have been required to develop ways to minimize 

water consumption and effluent discharges.  The reuse of in-plant liquid streams 

is a logical alternative to be considered (DIONÍSIO et al., 2010) and the bleach 

plant is the major source of liquid effluent in modern mills (DENCE &amp;amp; REEVE, 

1996). Bleach plant filtrate requiring external treatment is in the range of 15-30 



7 
 

m3/ADt (air dried tone of pulp). It is rich in organic matter and has a high color 

content and normally consists of two separate streams: an acidic stream and an 

alkaline stream. The alkaline filtrate has a high content of dissolved organic 

substances, measured by the COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) and color, and 

this contributes significantly to the effluent quality of the entire mill (POKHREL; 

VIRARAGHAVAN, 2004). 

Membrane filtration technology has been used in several industries, e.g., 

food, pharmaceutical, and water treatment (ROSENBERG et al., 2009; CHHAYA 

et al., 2013) and its use is increasing because new materials, better 

configurations, and cost reductions are rapidly developing. For example, until 

recently there was no polymeric membrane separation system that could resist 

high pH and temperature KASHER, 2009). While membrane technology remains 

rarely used in Kraft pulp mills, there is an increased interest from the pulp industry 

to find technically and economically attractive options to reduce water 

consumption and minimize effluent generation. One notable example is a 

membrane filtration plant that has been in operation since 1995 to clean bleach 

plant effluent at a Swedish sulfite pulp mill (NORDIN &amp;amp; JÖNSSON, 2006). In that 

case, a suitable membrane type and configuration were selected for membrane 

treatment of alkaline (EPO) filtrates (pH 11 and temperature 70 °C) from a 

softwood and hardwood kraft pulp mill.  Technically and economically optimal 

operation conditions for the system (transmembrane pressure, cross flow 

velocity, volume concentration factor and cleaning regime) to remove organic 

contaminants were selected. The results of this study showed that an 

ultrafiltration (UF) membrane with the pore size of 4000 g/mol achieved a COD 

and color removal of 65% and 93%, respectively (QUEZADA et al., 2014). 

During membrane filtration, two streams are generated: a permeate 

stream and a retentate. To develop a water conservation program in a mill, the 

challenge is to reuse these streams without compromising the mill processes and 

the product quality. The accumulation of elements and compounds (non-process 

elements) in the water cycle can cause severe problems in the mill (ULMGREN, 

1997; DOLDÁN et al., 2011), the most common in the bleach plant being 

associated with formation of barium sulfate, calcium carbonate and calcium 

oxalate. The amount of filtrate that can be reused depends on specific mill 

processes and configurations. 



8 
 

To predict the accumulation of non-process elements and the relative 

solubility of some compounds, it is possible to simulate these phenomena using 

computer simulation software (ULMGREN, 2001). The objectives of this study 

were to use pilot scale filtration and software simulation to evaluate the feasibility 

of recycling the UF permeate in the bleach plant and the reuse of the UF retentate 

in the black-liquor evaporation plant. 

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

UF Membrane treatment 
A filtrate from the wash press after the oxygen- and peroxide-reinforced 

extraction stage (EPO) was obtained from a kraft pulp mill, where the wood type 

changed every 6 months from hardwood to softwood. In both campaigns, the 

bleaching sequence was D(EPO)DD. 

A pilot membrane treatment of 19 L/min of (EPO) filtrate was performed 

during two months for each campaign (Figure 1). A continuous-feed two-stage 

membrane pilot plant was used. Each stage had three parallel tubular membrane 

modules, each of which was 3.6 m long and 1.3 cm in diameter, with a molecular 

weight cut-off of 4000 g/mol, and contained 18 perforated stainless-steel tubes in 

the form of a shell and a tube. Each tube was fitted with a membrane element. 

The operation conditions were a cross-flow velocity (CFV) of 3 m/s and a 

transmembrane pressure (TMP) of 7 bar, which provided a concentration volume 

factor (CVF) of 98. The membrane permeates and retentates obtained in both 

campaigns were collected, stored at 4°C, and characterized according to the 

Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (APHA, 2005). 

The parameters measured in the permeate and retentate were COD, pH, color, 

sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, barium, aluminum, 

sulfate, phosphorus and chloride. There were 15 repetitions of COD, pH, and 

color and 2 repetitions of the other parameters.

Membrane permeate reuse 
A full mill model was developed in WinGEMS software, which specially 

focused on pulp and paper production. A steady-state model was created for the 

full pulp mill, including balances for water, energy, sodium/sulfur and non-process 

elements (NPE). Precipitation and accumulation models regarding handling of 

NPE’s and scaling was integrated into the software (ULMGREN, 1997, 2001). 

The model takes into account temperature, ionic strength, pH, concentrations, 

over-saturation etc. to predict the solubility for each compound and the extent to 

which precipitations may occur. 

Using the simulation model, the hot fresh water added to the (EOP) press 

was stepwise replaced with permeate from the membrane filtration unit until 

100% of the washing liquor on the press was the UF permeate. The simulations 

were run in each case to the steady-state condition after various recycle rates of 

the permeate, and the risk of the effects in the pulp mill was evaluated.  

Membrane retentate recycling 
The small concentrated stream obtained from the UF treatment of the 

(EPO) filtrate was rich in organic matter with high molecular weight compounds. 

One possible alternative to reuse this stream was to send it to the black liquor 

cycle.

The effect of reusing the UF retentate fraction on the black-liquor 

evaporation plant was evaluated by comparing the concentration of specific 

elements in the weak black liquor (WBL) with the mixture of UF retentate (WBL) 

for each campaign. The elements and compounds that were assessed according 

to the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (APHA, 

2005) in the retentate and the weak black liquor were: sodium, calcium, 

potassium, magnesium, manganese, barium, aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, 

chloride and sulfate. Two repetitions were performed for each parameter. 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

UF Membrane treatment 
The separation with ultrafiltration membrane achieved a 79% removal of 

the COD and 86% removal of the color. The results indicate that the permeate 

flow and the removal of COD and color did not change significantly by changing 

the raw material for the production of bleached pulp. The characterization of the 

(EPO) filtrate, UF permeate and UF retentate from the pilot filtration is shown in

Membrane permeate reuse 
The calcium carbonate formation in the (EPO) filtrate can be a critical 

parameter causing operational problems in the bleach plant because of scaling, 

particularly on the pulp washers. In the softwood campaign, the calcium 

concentration was lower in the UF permeate (0.95 mg/L) than in the hot water 

(1.60 mg/L) and therefore it decreased when the UF permeate reuse increased. 

However, a much higher concentration of carbonate ions in the permeate (350 

mg/L) compared to hot water (where it could not be detected) increased the 

formation of calcium carbonate in the (EPO) stage pulp and in the (EPO) filtrate 

(Figure 2).  

In the (EPO) stage, the calcium carbonate formation increased with the 

addition of carbonate ions as calcium carbonate was precipitated and was 

trapped by the fibers.  

Figure 2 shows that calcium carbonate formed in the (EPO) filtrate when 

UF permeate replacement of hot water reached 50%. However, the amount of 

calcium carbonate formed, even at 100% replacement of hot water was still below 

the supersaturation point (the concentration of calcium and carbonate necessary 

to start precipitation (WOJTOWICZ, 1998; DUGGIRALA, 2005). Even if extra 

permeate were to be added, to the extent that the supersaturation concentration 

was exceeded, the calcium carbonate retains calcium and carbonate ions in the 

solution, i.e., an initially even higher concentration than equilibrium is required to 

begin the precipitation of calcium carbonate. However, when the precipitation 

begins, all precipitates immediately form at that point (WOJTOWICZ, 1998). 

The reuse of UF permeate increases the risk of precipitation compared to 

the base case, but according to these simulations, the risk is small. 

The hardwood campaign had higher calcium carbonate levels in the fiber 

line than the softwood campaign, but no formation of calcium carbonate in the 

(EPO) filtrate was observed in the simulations. (Figure 3). According to analysis, 

there would be a slightly different split of calcium carbonate in the wash press 

with less calcium carbonate to filtrate and more calcium carbonate to the following 

bleaching stage. Note that the solubility data differ between hardwood and 

softwood.

The magnesium hydroxide formation decreased in both campaigns in the 

(EPO) stage when the UF permeate use was increased because there was less 

magnesium in the UF permeate than in the hot water (Table 1). In the softwood 

campaign, the magnesium hydroxide formation was 185 g/ADt without using UF 

permeate and 160 g/ADt with 100% of UF permeate use. In the hardwood 

campaign, these values were 61 g/ADt and 50 g/ADt, respectively.

The recycling of 100% UF permeate reduced the water consumption of the 

bleaching area by 5.4 m3/ADt and 5.8 m3/ADt in the hardwood and softwood 

campaigns, respectively.  

Membrane retentate recycling 
According to the flow and elemental composition of the membrane 

retentate, the addition of this stream into the weak black liquor prior to 

evaporation would result in a negligible increase in the concentration of the 

assessed elements in the weak black liquor (Table 2). During the hardwood 

campaign, the aluminum and manganese concentrations had the largest 

increase in the weak black liquor (1.72% and 1.96%, respectively). In the 

softwood campaign, aluminum and magnesium had the largest increase in 

concentration (2.63% and 2.59%, respectively). 

WinGEMS simulation was performed for the softwood campaign. In the 

simulations, the retentate was added to the weak black liquor. This was done to 

fully study the build-up of non-process elements. The steady state results showed 

that the chloride levels in the black and white liquor would increase by 5%, 

assuming that the ESP-dust extraction rate is held constant. The need for make-

up chemicals would decrease slightly due to the addition of sodium and sulfate. 

If a slightly higher ESP-dust extraction rate was to be applied to limit the increase 

in chloride levels, a slightly higher consumption of make-up chemicals should be 

expected. 

Black liquor is composed of the organic material dissolved from the wood 

in the digester and from the oxygen delignification plant and also of cooking and 

oxygen-bleaching chemicals. In the recirculation of bleach plant effluent, the 

dissolved material from bleaching and chemicals used in bleaching are also found 

in the black liquor. In addition, non-process elements that circulate in the chemical 

recovery cycle are also found (CARDOSO et al., 2009). 

Scaling on heat transfer surfaces occurs at high dry-solid concentration. 

The scaling tendency of the black liquor depends on the calcium content and the 

amount of inert components, such as sodium sulfate and sodium carbonate 

(CHEN &amp;amp; GAO, 2004). Calcium carbonate scaling in the evaporators is the most 

frequently identified inorganic-deposit in the kraft cycle. This phenomenon occurs 

in the presence of optimal substrate (non-uniform surface), optimal conditions 

(temperature shocks and alkaline pH) and increases in the concentrations of 



14 
 

dissolved cations and anions, such as calcium and carbonate (MACADAM &amp;amp; 

PARSONS, 2004). With the levels of chemicals in the membrane retentate and 

the black liquor, the simulation shows that the calcium concentration in the weak 

black-liquor stream should increase by 0.66% and 1.13% in softwood and 

hardwood campaigns, respectively. It is expected that this increase of the calcium 

concentration will not induce calcium carbonate scaling.

From the viewpoint of recovery boiler chemistry, the molar ratio between 

total sulfur and sodium in the black liquor, is one of the most important 

parameters. There is a critical relationship governing the chemistry of sulfur and 

sodium in the recovery boiler and it varies significantly among different processes 

and even in the same process depending on the operation strategy of the boiler 

(EMPIE, 2009). 

Comparing the sodium and sulfate contents of the membrane retentate 

and the black liquor, sodium increased by 0.04% and 0.03%, whereas sulfur in 

the form of sulfate increased by 0.05% and 0.04% for softwood and hardwood, 

respectively. It is therefore expected that the ratio of sulfur/sodium will remain 

essentially unchanged after the retentate addition to the black liquor stream, and 

hence the recovery boiler chemical performance will not be affected. 



15 
 

CONCLUSIONS 
 

The membrane treatment obtained a COD removal of 79% and 86% of 

color. 

In both hardwood and softwood cases, simulation predicts that 100% 

replacement of hot water in the (EPO) press should be technically possible 

(saving 5.4 m3/ADt and 5.8 m3/ADt, respectively). All precipitation levels slightly 

decreased because of the lower NPE content in the permeate, and the 

supersaturation calculations indicate that the precipitation of calcium carbonate 

will not start even with 100% of the hot water being replaced by UF permeate. 

According to the characterization of the (EPO) retentate, it should be 

feasible to recycle the retentate to the evaporation area without scaling formation 

or affecting the performance of the recovery boiler.

CAPITULO 2: ULTRAFILTRATION OF ACIDIC EFFLUENT FROM A KRAFT 
PULP MILL 

 

 

ABSTRACT 
 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of membrane technology to 

treat chlorine dioxide stage acidic effluent from a kraft pulp mill bleach plant. A 

pilot plant using ultrafiltration (UF) membranes with an average pore size of 4.000 

g/mol was used to determine the feasibility of the treatment. The reuse of the 

permeate and the effects on the effluent treatment plant (ETP) were evaluated 

using the simulation softwares, WinGEMSTM and BioWinTM. The acidic effluent 

ultrafiltration achieved a COD and color removal of 65% and 82%, respectively. 

If the permeate is reused within the bleaching process, it is expected to increase 

the risk of scaling of barium sulfate in the first chlorine dioxide stage in 10% when 

25% of the drier whitewater is replaced with permeate. In this scenario, software 

simulation results indicated a decrease in the COD of the final effluent and in the 

biological sludge generation in 42% and 37%, respectively. 

 

Keywords: Ultrafiltration, acidic effluent, bleaching, simulation process, water 

reuse. 

INTRODUCTION 
 

Due to the continuous increase in the environmental restrictions and public 

awareness, the pulp and paper industry is looking for options to reduce water 

consumption (BAJPAI, 2012). In a kraft pulp process, the removal of the residual 

lignin from the pulp suspension by means of chemical reactions is carried out in 

a bleaching plant. The bleaching process consists of several stages, in which the 

pulp is chemically treated and then washed to remove spent bleaching chemicals 

and dissolved pulp components (HUBER et al., 2014). After the first ClO2 stage 

(D), an extraction stage is employed to dissolve soluble in alkali. In a modern 

bleaching sequence, the extraction stage is reinforced with oxygen and hydrogen 

peroxide (EPO), increasing the lignin removal and brightness (BRIAN N. &amp;amp; 

BROGDON, 2008). 

 



19 
 

In general, each bleaching stage is composed of a mixer reactor followed 

by a pulp washer. The bleaching plant filtrates from the washers constitute the 

major source of effluent that is sent to the effluent treatment plant (ETP). 

The chemical composition of the bleaching filtrates depends greatly on the 

incoming wood raw material, the bleaching sequence and the precise condition 

under which the bleaching stages are performed.  

A difference in the molecular weight distribution has been detected 

between the alkaline and acid effluent from an ECF (elemental chlorine free) plant 

(VAN TRAN, 2006). The alkaline filtrate contains a significantly higher proportion 

of high molecular weight substances (65-75%) than the acidic filtrate (20%). The 

lignin  in the acidic filtrate has a much lower molecular weight than that in the 

alkaline effluent (DENCE &amp;amp; REEVE, 1996). 

The treatment of specific in-plant streams seems to be an attractive 

technical and economical approach because it allows the use of advanced 

technologies such as membrane filtration (KASHER, 2009). 

Several studies have reported the use of a membrane filtration to treat 

alkaline bleaching plant effluent (NORDIN &amp;amp; JÖNSSON, 2006; QUEZADA et al., 

2014) ADICIONAR MAIS, but only few studies have evaluated the feasibility of 

the membrane treatment of the acidic effluent.  

The characteristics of the effluent to be treated directly affect the selection 

of membrane. The factors that most affect polymeric membrane structure are the 

temperature and pH (NILSSON et al., 2008). Extremes pH can produce a 

dissociation of the functional groups of the membrane and may cause the pores 

to swell (LUO &amp;amp; WAN, 2013). The develop of new polymeric membrane material 

with better resistance to extreme conditions and with higher fluxes is useful for 

industrial applications (SHARMA, 2005) 

By increasing water circuit closure of the bleach plant, some dissolved 

species can accumulate in process loops, which may lead to scale deposits. The 

most frequent types of scale in bleaching lines are composed of calcium 

carbonate (in the alkaline stages), calcium oxalate and barium sulfate (in the 

acidic stages). Barium sulfate (Barite) deposits form in supersaturated solutions 

containing both barium and sulfate. The main barium source is the wood (higher 

in the bark than  in the stem) and the main sulfate source is the sulfuric acid used 

for pH regulation (HUBER et al., 2014). Barite (BaSO4) is a very insoluble mineral 

and it is less soluble at cold temperatures, so that it is important to avoid 



20 
 

temperature drops anywhere in the bleaching line, especially on the washers. 

The precipitation tendency of barite is pH-dependent; this is because the 

availability of sulfate anions is governed by the second dissociation of sulfuric 

acid. Barite does not require high supersaturation to start precipitating. Therefore, 

there is a risk of precipitation as soon as Saturation Index is higher than zero (SI 

&gt; 0). Although there is a limited amount of barium in wood (corresponding to a 

few mM concentration in the conditions of the bleaching line), any increase in the 

barium source may enhance barite deposits (RUDIE &amp;amp; HART, 2006).  

Process simulation have proved to be very useful in designing and 

optimizing pulp and paper production processes. Various applications have been 

developed using some simulation packages: ASPEN Plus (OLSSON, 2009), 

CADSIM (DIONÍSIO et al., 2010), WinGEMS (CULBERTSON et al., 2016), and 

others.  

WinGEMS (Metso Automation) is a process simulator developed for 

application in the pulp and paper industry. Steady-state and dynamic behavior 

can be modelled using this simulator, it is useful when calculating long-term 

trends, debottlenecking and performing economic analysis. Dynamic modelling 

can be used for storage analysis, developing control strategies or tracking 

component flow through the system and investigating build up times. The 

software uses a sequential modular approach in an interactive way for calculation 

of mass and energy balances. It has advantages for being relatively easy to learn 

and user-friendly. However, the basic version is rather limited, especially when it 

comes to more detailed process chemistry. The software, however, has the 

advantage of allowing the user to expand the capabilities by implementation of 

new calculation routines. WinGEMS only resolve mass and heat balances, but 

do not account for chemical equilibria. On the other hand, chemical speciation 

methods can help to determine local scaling risk in a given process, but do not 

help to predict the consequences of a process modification as such. To solve this 

problem, it is possible to create a bridge between process simulation and 

chemical speciation engines in order to take into account electrolyte chemistry 

problems. 

The objectives of the present work were to evaluate i) the feasibility of the 

ultrafiltration membrane treatment of the bleach plant acidic effluent from a kraft 

pulp mill, ii) software simulation tool to simulate the feasibility to recycle the clean 



21 
 

filtrate and determine the risk of barium sulfate precipitation, and iii) evaluate the 

effects on the effluent treatment plant with software simulation. 

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Effluent 
The acidic bleach plant effluent (Table 1) was obtained from a softwood 

kraft pulp mill with a bleaching sequence D0(EPO)D1D2. Three samples were 

obtained from the washpress after the first D-stage during normal operation. The 

COD, color and metals were determined according to Standard Methods for the 

Examination of Water and Wastewater (APHA, 2005). 

In the mill, after each chlorine dioxide bleaching stage (D) the pulp was 

washed, the D0 stage pulp was washed with filtrate from the D1 press and the D1 

pulp was washed with the D2 filtrate. The D2 pulp was washed with whitewater 

from the drainage of the pulp drying process. A characterization of the whitewater 

is also presented in Table 1.

UF membrane treatment 
The membrane treatment was carried out using a batch feed one-stage 

pilot plant (Figure 1). The pilot plant was equipped with 4 PCI B1 series flow 

module (tubular), with a single flow through the membrane (Figure 2). The 

membrane was 1.2 m long and 1.3 cm in diameter, the total membrane area per 

module was 1.3 x 10-5 m2.  

 
Figure 1 – Ultrafiltration Pilot Plant 

 

The feed pump has operated at a pressure of 6 bar. The pilot plant was 

fed with the acidic effluent previously collected, characterized and stored at 5?C. 
The tubular membrane type used in this study (ESP04) was  manufactured 

by PCI, made by modified polyether sulfone with a molecular weight cut-off 

(MWCO) of 4.000 g/mol. Three tests were carried out with 10 L of effluent each, 

until the maximum volumetric concentration factor (VCF) was achieved.

studied by process simulation, in order to determine the risk of scaling formation 

of barium sulfate (barite).  

The strategy of create a bridge between process simulation and chemical 

speciation engines in order to take into account electrolyte chemistry problems 

was adopted in this study: the basic WinGEMS version was expanded with the 

Pitzer electrolytic solutions model for calculation of chemical equilibrium. The 

Pitzer model takes as input the composition a given solution (in terms of molality, 

or moles of component per kg of solvent), as well as several thermodynamic 

parameters. As out-put, it calculates the activity coefficient of each component in 

solution. These activity coefficients are necessary for solubility calculations, as 

they are related to the solubility products Ksp of the precipitating electrolytes. 

The new WinGEMS block was developed through the Block Development 

Kit (BDK) application-programming interface (API), specifically designed to allow 

users to create their own specialized blocks. BDK consists of a collection of static 

libraries, header and source C++ files that, when compiled into a dynamic-link 

library (DLL), provides the subroutines to be called by the custom block. 

Using the simulation model, the whitewater added to the D2 press was 

replaced with UF permeate. The simulations were run, in each case, to the 

steady-state condition at permeate reuse rates of 0%, 25%, 50% and 100%. 

Effects on the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) 
The effects of the ultrafiltration of the acidic effluent on the effluent 

treatment plant was evaluated by process simulation in BioWin (EnviroSim) 

software. The final treated effluent characteristics and sludge production were 

determined. 

The mill’s effluent biological treatment plant consists of an activated sludge 

plant (Table 2).  Each line is constituted by 4 biological selector reactors in series 

with 2.1, 1.7, 0.9 and 0.9 h of retention time) followed by one bioreactor (8.9 h of 

retention time) and a clarifier.  

The readily biodegradable COD, non-colloidal slowly biodegradable COD, 

unbiodegradable soluble COD and unbiodegradable particulate COD were 

determined by respirometric and/or chemical methods. Five samples were 



24 
 

collected at the neutralization stage (before the biological treatment) and five to 

the treated effluent 

The readily biodegradable COD was determined by respirometric and 

chemical methods. The respirometric method consist in adjust a sample from 

neutralization chamber to the relation food/microorganism (F/M) 0.3. The sample 

was saturated with oxygen to a concentration of 7 mg O2/L. When the aeration 

stopped, the amount of oxygen was measured every 2 minutes for 30 minutes. 

The specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) was obtained (slope of the graph 

dissolved oxygen vs time). The first fraction of the graph SOUR vs time presented 

the readily biodegradable COD.  

The chemical method consists in a coagulation with Al2(SO4)3 (100 mg/L) 

fallowed by a filtration (0,45 µm) of the samples from the neutralization stage and 

from the treated effluent. The COD from the coagulated and filtrated sample was 

the readily biodegradable and the non-biodegradable COD, the readily 

biodegradable was obtained subtracting the coagulated and filtrated treated 

effluent COD. 

The COD measurement of all the fractions allows also determinate the 

non-colloidal slowly biodegradable COD (gCOD/f of slowly degradable COD), 

unbiodegradable soluble COD (gCOD/g of total COD), unbiodegradable 

particulate COD (gCOD/g of total COD), etc.

In order to determine sludge production and treated effluent 

characteristics, four scenarios were evaluated. Scenario 1: simulate the biological 

treatment of the current industrial effluent as a reference; Scenario 2: simulate 

the biological effluent treatment without the acidic filtrate but with the added UF 

permeate; Scenario 3: simulate the biological effluent treatment without the acidic 

filtrate and without the UF permeate (the permeate from the UF was recycled 

within the mill) and Scenario 4: Simulate the biological treatment without the 

acidic filtrate; and with 25% of replacement of white water on the bleaching plant. 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

UF membrane treatment 
According to commercial specification, the ESP04 ultrafiltration membrane 

have resistance to extremes pH and high temperature, this was confirmed by the 

results obtained. No irreversible fouling produced by the swelling of the pores 

was observed and COD and color reduction were achieved.  

The characterization of the ultrafiltration permeate and retentate obtained 

in the pilot plant (Figure 2) is shown in Table 4. The treatment with ultrafiltration 

achieved a COD and color removal of 65% and 82%, respectively. It was possible 

to concentrate the effluent to a concentration factor (VCF) of 0.92, this means 

that for every 100 L/s treated, the stream of retentate should have a flow rate of 

8 L/s. 

The separation and concentration of heavy metals from wastewaters is a 

proven application of membrane technology (reverse osmosis) (COX, 2006; 

STOVER, 2012; SAIF; ALMANSOORI; ELKAMEL, 2013). Metal solubility varies 



26 
 

with pH, in a UF-based wastewater treatment system usually the pH is first raised 

to precipitate metals out of the solution and then the UF-treatment is carried.

In this case, the pH of the acid filtrate was 3.4, so presumably the metals 

are in solution. According to the molecular weight cut-off of the ultrafiltration 

membrane the heavy metals should pass through the membrane and stay on the 

permeate fraction. The reduction of metals and inorganics by ultrafiltration was 

observed (Table 2). Silica had the highest removal (63%). Ca, K, Mn and P had 

a removal of 19, 20, 21, and 14%, respectively. It is reported that metals can be 

removed by the interaction with suspended solids, colloids or fiber (BERNAT et 

al., 2007; BERNATA et al., 2008; QIU &amp;amp; MAO, 2013). 

In order to avoid scaling formation of Barite, is necessary to remove barium 

from the effluent, the UF treatment only removed 5%. 

Membrane permeate reuse 
The barite (BaSO4) deposits formation in the D-stages can be a critical 

parameter causing operational problems in the bleach plant. The main source of 



27 
 

barium is the wood and the presence of sulfate is due to the use of sulfuric acid 

for pH regulation or as carry-over from brownstock washing (HUBER et al., 2014). 

Figure 3 shows the barite formation in acidic bleaching stages when the 

whitewater was replaced by UF permeate. 
 

 

 
Figure 3 – Barite formation in acidic bleaching stages with white water 

replacement. 

 

The barium concentration in the UF permeate was 5.7 times greater than 

in the whitewater and led to formation of scale deposits after 25% of whitewater 

where replaced (Figure 3). At this rate, the amount of barium in solid state (as 

barite) is 10%. All the calculations were carried out without considering the 

interaction of the barium and sulfate with the fiber. In some conditions, the barium 

can be adsorbed by the fibers (LITVAY et al., 2003). It is expected that with 25% 

of replacement the amount of barite formation will not be a critical problem. With 

25% of replacement of whitewater it is possible to reduce the water consumption 

in 3.560 m3/d. The non-used whitewater can replace hot water in the (EPO) 

washer, and hot water reused within the mill replacing the clean water intake. 

Further studies must be carried out to determinate the feasibility of this water 

circuit. 

In order to increase the replacement of the whitewater and reduce the 

water consumption it is necessary to reduce the amount of barium and sulfate in 

the fiberline. This can be achieved by improving the de-barking of the wood since 

the barium content of the bark it is much higher than in the stem wood (PERSSON

et al., 2002), and by changing the sulfuric acid as a pH regulator and control the 

carry–over from brownstock (RUDIE &amp;amp; HART, 2006). 

With 50% of replacement of whitewater by the UF permeate, 50% of the 

barium formed barite and the risk of scaling increased considerably, considering 

that without permeate reuse the amount of barite is 0% (according to software 

simulation). 

Effects on the ETP 
The characteristics of the treated effluent of the industrial ETP (average of 

90 samples) and the results of the model simulation are presented in Table 6. 

The model was developed to obtain a steady-state condition and the results of 

Scenario 1 were used for validation of the model. The COD fractions obtained 

are presented in Table 5.

The simulated biological treatment had the same hydraulic retention time 

(14.5 h) and solid retention time (15 d). The VSS of the industrial biological reactor 

is 2.888 mg/L (mean of 90 samples) and the value obtained at Scenario 1 

(reference) was 2.892 mg/L. The COD removal, NTK, and phosphorus for this 

scenario was statistically equal to the real values. There was a difference 

between the sludge production of 5.4% (larger), because this parameter depends 

of kinetic variables (GERNAEY et al., 2004), which some were assumed by the 

software (endogenous fraction, aerobic decay rate, maximum specific growth 

rate, etc.). 

The results showed that in Scenario 2 (the ETP treats the UF-permeate) 

there was a reduction in the COD load of the final effluent by 38% and the waste 

biosludge production by 36% because of the decrease of the COD load of the 

affluent.  



29 
 

It is expected that in the actual biological treatment, the COD removal 

increase because the large organic molecules are retained by the membrane and 

the permeate had small size molecules that are biodegradable, i.e., there is an 

increase in the biodegradable organic matter ratio of the effluent. (MOUNTEER 

et al., 2007).

UF was recycled within the mill) and Scenario 4: Simulate the biological treatment without 

the acidic filtrate; and with 25% of replacement of white water on the bleaching plant 

 

If barium and sulfate is removed from the fiberline, it would be possible to 

implement Scenario 3 (100% of replace of whitewater). In this case it will 

decrease the water consumption in 25% and the operation cost related to 

aeration in 50%. 

CONCLUSIONS 
 

The main conclusions of this works are as fallow: 

i) It was possible to treat the acidic filtrate from a kraft pulp mill with 
ultrafiltration membranes, COD and color removal was 65% and 82% 
respectively. 

ii) The ultrafiltration treatment removed a fraction of metals and 
inorganics compounds from the acidic effluent without a pretreatment 
or pH adjustment. 



30 
 

iii) Computer model simulation predicted that 25% of replacement 
generate a precipitation of 10% of the total barium and will reduce the 
COD and waste sludge production in 42% and 40%, respectively. 

iv) If all the permeate it is sent directly to the ETP, the COD of the final 
effluent and the waste biosludge production will reduce 38% and 36%, 
respectively. 

v) Further studies must be carried to determined the best usage of the 
retentate, the effects on the final product and on the chemical 
consumption in the bleaching plant.

CAPITULO 3: TREATMENT OF BLEACHING PLANT EFFLUENT FROM A 
KRAFT PULP MILL BY ELECTROCOAGULATION PROCESS 

 

ABSTRACT 
Acidic and alkaline effluent from a kraft pulp bleaching plant mill was treated by 

electrocoagulation (EC) process using aluminum and iron electrodes. The best 

COD removal was achieved in both cases (acidic and alkaline effluent) with 

aluminum electrodes. The COD and color removal of the acidic effluent was 51 

and 90% respectively, and the COD and color removal of the alkaline effluent 

was 48 and 73%, respectively. The feasibility of the treated effluent reuse was 

evaluated by computer simulation using WinGEMS software and chemical 

speciation methods. According to the steady-state simulation, 100% of the hot 

water can be replaced with treated acidic or alkaline effluent without scaling of 

calcium carbonate. The effect of the EC treatment on the mill effluent treatment 

plant was evaluated using BioWin software simulation. Compared with the actual 

mill, the reuse of the treated acid effluent decreased the COD load in the final 

effluent by 57 %, the waste biosludge generation by 30% and water consumption 

by 21%. 

 

Keywords: Electrocoagulation, bleaching effluent, simulation process, water 

reuse. 

INTRODUCTION 
 

The pulp and paper mills consume large amounts of fresh water and 

therefore discharge proportionally large volume of effluents. Pulp mills worldwide 

have been required to develop ways to minimize water consumption and effluent 

discharges. 

The treatment of specific in-plant streams seems to be an attractive 

technical and economical approach because it allows the use of advance 

technologies such as membrane filtration (QUEZADA et al., 2014) and 

electrocoagulation (ZAIED &amp;amp; BELLAKHAL, 2009).  



35 
 

Traditional methods for dealing with the wastewater consist of biological, 

physical, and chemical processes and their different combinations. The typical 

treatment processes for pulp and paper effluents are chemical precipitation, 

aerated lagoons and activated sludge. 

Physical chemical technologies such as coagulation/flocculation by 

chemical precipitation include three stages of solid/liquid removal. First, the 

chemical agent is added to the water to destabilization of the pollutants; second, 

the formation of larger particles via slow mixing, which promotes the collision of 

the particles and the consequent aggregation; and third step is the solid-liquid 

separation by sedimentation or flotation of the formed flocs. In the conventional 

treatment chemicals such as polymers, iron and aluminum salts are used (HOLT 

et al., 2005). 

Despite the availability of the above mentioned methods, effluent 

treatment alternatives with comparative advantages, such as automation of 

processes and cost, have been studied, highlighting the electrocoagulation (EC) 

as a promising technology (CHEN, 2004). 

In electrocoagulation process, an electrochemical reactor carries out the 

steps of convectional coagulation providing the coagulant “in situ”. It is based on 

dissolution of the electrode material used as an anode. This so-called “sacrificial 

anode” produces metal ions which act as coagulant agents in the aqueous 

solution. The electrodes are usually made of aluminum, iron, or stainless steel 

(EMAMJOMEH &amp;amp; SIVAKUMAR, 2009).  

During EC, the following main reactions with the metal (M) take place at 

the electrodes: 

Anode: 

( ) ? ( ) +              (1)   2 ? 4 + + 4   
 

Cathode: 

( ) + ? ( )               (2) 2 + 2 ? ( ) + 2  
 

Electrochemically generated metal cations will react spontaneously, 

forming various monomeric species, in the case of aluminum anode, such as 

Al(OH)2+, Al2(OH)24+, and Al(OH)4- and polymeric species such as Al6(OH)153+, 

Al7(OH)174+, Al8(OH)204+, Al13O4(OH)244+ and Al13(OH)345+. 



36 
 

Advantages of EC over conventional coagulation process include 

economic aspects (relatively low investment cost, maintenance, energy, and 

treatment costs), significantly lower volume of sludge produced, better sludge 

quality (lower water content, larger and more stable flocs with better settlability), 

similar or slightly better efficiency, avoidance of chemical addition, ease of 

automation, simple and compact size of EC system, broad functional pH range 

and pH neutralization effect, and the presence of electroflotation (MOLLAH et al., 

2001). However, limited researches have been reported the treatment of pulp 

bleaching effluent using EC method (SRIDHAR et al., 2011). 

After EC treatment, a clean water is generated. To develop a water 

conservation program in a mill, it is necessary to reuse this stream without risking 

the mill process. The accumulation of elements and compounds in the water cycle 

can cause severe problems in the mill (PARTHASARATHY &amp;amp; 

KRISHNAGOPALAN, 2001; DOLDÁN et al., 2011); the most common in the 

bleach plant is the formation of barium sulfate, calcium carbonate and calcium 

oxalate (DUGGIRALA, 2005; HUBER et al., 2014). 

Scaling occurs when part of the dissolved solids in a solution precipitates, 

which leads to the formation of layer of solids over contacting surfaces. Scaling 

is, therefore, intimately related to the solubility of the compounds present in 

solution (ANTONY et al., 2011). In order to predict the relative solubility of some 

compounds, it is possible to simulate these phenomena using computer 

simulation software (AMIRI &amp;amp; MOGHADASI, 2010). 

The objectives of this study were to i) evaluate the influence of current 

density, initial pH, electrode material and process time on the electrocoagulation 

treatment of bleaching plant effluents, ii) develop a software simulation tool to 

evaluate the feasibility of recycling the clean treated effluents in the bleach plant 

and iii) determinate the effects on the effluent treatment plant. 

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Effluent 
The characteristics of the acidic and the alkaline effluents from the 

bleaching plant (Figure 1) of a softwood kraft pulp mill were mesured. The COD, 

color, conductivity and metals (3 samples) were determined according to 

Standard Methods for the Examination of Water (APHA, 2005). The acidic 



37 
 

effluent was obtained from the wash press of the D0 stage and the alkaline 

effluent from the wash press from the EOP stage, during normal operation of the 

mill. All samples were stored at 5°C.

Electrocoagulation 
The electrocoagulation (EC) test was carried in a 2L batch electrochemical 

reactor (Figure 2) with 8 plates (electrodes) of 13 x 15 cm each and a distance 

between the electrodes of 1.4 cm approximately. The connection with the power 

source was in parallel, this way the electrodes are monopolar. The EC treatment 

was carried out under constant stirring of 150 rpm. The design of the 

electrochemical reactor was based from previews studies (VALENTE et al., 

2012). The initial temperature of the effluent was approximately 25 ?C.

Two different types of materials for the construction of the electrodes were 

tested, aluminum (99% pure) and iron (99.45% pure). For each type of electrode, 

it was evaluated the influence of the initial pH, current density (amount of electric 

flowing per unit cross-sectional area of material) and the time of reaction. 

For each effluent (acidic and alkaline) was evaluated the 

electrocoagulation with both electrodes composition (aluminum and iron) (Table 

1). The experimental design was a Box-Behnken type. It was made 12 

combinations among the levels of the three factors (pH, current density and time) 

and five replicates related to the combination center point for estimation of the 

residual error, totaling 17 experiments per electrode/effluent (68 tests considering 

both electrodes material and both effluents).  The conditions were selected 

according to previous research (CHANWORRAWOOT &amp;amp; HUNSOM, 2012). 

The pH of the sample was adjusted to the condition of the experimental 

design using NaOH or H2SO4. After the treatment, separation of liquid and solid 

was carried out by sedimentation for a period of 30 minutes. The COD, color and 

metals were determined by according to Standard Methods for the Examination 

of Water (APHA, 2005).

Process simulation 
The feasibility of the reuse of the effluent treated with EC was studied by 

process simulation, to determined the potential of scaling formation of barium 

sulfate (in the acidic stage), calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide (in the 

alkaline stage).  

For mill simulations it was used about 30 data sets, containing about 5 

variables per set collected at the mill and a full characterization of metals, salts, 

organic matter was made.

Data and the information entry to the WinGEMS models involve solving 

mass and energy process balances through interactive calculations. Given the 

complexity of the bleach plant and the non-process elements (NPE) distribution, 

it was necessary to develop a new block with the Pitzer electrolytic solutions 

model for calculation of chemical equilibrium. The Pitzer model uses as input data 

the composition of a given solution (in terms of molality, or moles of component 

per kg of solvent), as well as the several thermodynamic parameters. 

Using the simulation model, the hot water added to the (EPO) press-

washer was replaced by the acidic or alkaline treated effluent. The simulations 

were run, in each case, to the steady-state condition at water replacement rates 

of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100%. 

Effects on the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) 
The effects of the treatment with electrocoagulation of the acidic effluent 

and/or the alkaline effluent, on the effluent treatment plant (ETP) were evaluated 

by process simulation in BioWinTM (EnviroSim) software. It was determined the 

final effluent characteristics and sludge production. The mill’s effluent biological 

treatment plant consists of an activated sludge (extended aeration) plant.  Each 

line is constituted by 4 biological aerated selectors (2.1, 1.7, 0.9 and 0.9 h of 

retention time), a bioreactor (8.9 h of retention time) and a secondary clarifier. 

Five scenarios were evaluated for hot water replacement. Scenario 1: 

simulate the biological treatment of the existing industrial effluent plant as 

reference; Scenario 2: simulate the biological effluent treatment without the acidic 

effluent but with the added acidic treated effluent (EC with aluminum electrode 

treatment); Scenario 3: simulate the biological effluent treatment without the 

acidic effluent and without treated acid effluent  (the treated effluent from the EC 

was recycled within the mill); Scenario 4: simulate the biological effluent treatment 

without the alkaline effluent but with the added treated alkaline effluent (EC with 

aluminum electrode treatment), and Scenario 5: simulate the biological effluent 

treatment without the alkaline effluent and without treated alkaline effluent  (the 

treated effluent from the EC was recycled within the mill).

Electrocoagulation of acidic effluent 
The results of the electrocoagulation treatment of the acidic effluent with 

aluminum electrodes is presented in the Figure 3. According to the statistical 

analysis, the optimum point for the COD removal was obtained for the initial pH 

3.4, the current density 120 A/m2 and the reaction time of 50 minutes. At this 

condition, the final pH was 8 and the COD and color removal was 51% and 90%, 

respectively, considering the reactor volume and the electrode area, the removal 

of COD and color was 8 g/Lm2 and 12.000 CU/Lm2, respectively.

aluminum electrode. 

 

The obtained flocs were well formed, stable and compacted, they floated 

with the H2 generated in the reaction. This flotation phenomenon was described 

by other authors as advantages of the electrocoagulation process (MOLLAH et 

al., 2001; BUTLER et al., 2011; KHANDEGAR &amp;amp; SAROHA, 2013; SAHU et al., 

2014). At the optimum COD removal conditions, the sludge production was 0.21 

g per liter of effluent treated, i.e., the treatment of all the acidic effluent will 

generate 2.7 t/d of sludge.  Further studies must be carried out to determined the 

best sludge treatment/disposal strategy. 

Other advantage of this process is the metals removal, which was 

observed in this study and reported by other authors (EMAMJOMEH &amp;amp; 

SIVAKUMAR, 2009; KABDA?LI et al., 2009; CHATURVEDI, 2013; PULKKA et 

al., 2014). The reduction of the heavy metals is presented in  Table 3. The treated 

effluent had an increase of 1700% in the aluminum concentration after the 

treatment.

The results of the electrocoagulation treatment of the acidic effluent with

The obtained flocs were well formed and most of them floated with the H2 

generated in the reaction. According to the statistical analysis the optimum point 

for the COD removal was obtained when the initial pH was 7, the current density 

144 A/m2 and the reaction time 50 minutes. At this condition, the final pH was 11 

and the COD and color removal was 47% and 66%, respectively. Considering the 

reactor volume and the electrode area, the removal of COD and color was 7,8 

g/Lm2 and 11.700 CU/Lm2. The color removal was lower than the treatment with 

aluminum electrode because of the orange coloring of the effluent due to the 

presence of Fe(OH) (MOLLAH et al., 2001; MORENO et al., 2007; 

CHATURVEDI, 2013). In order to have COD and color removal larger than 20% 

the pH of the effluent, it must be increased to at least 5. This pH adjustment 

affects directly on the treatment cost. The reduction of the elements is presented 

in the Table 4.

For the treatment of the acidic effluent, the EC with aluminum electrode 

achieved the higher COD and color reduction without pH adjustment, i.e, more 



43 
 

suitable treatment to generate an effluent capable to be reused within the 

process. 

 If the treated effluent is reused within the acidic or alkaline stage, pH, 

COD, calcium, hydroxide and barium amount are critical parameters, because of 

the risk of scaling formation (HUBER et al, 2014) and the increase of chemical 

dosage for bleaching (COLODETTE et al., 2006; JANNE et al., 2013; KOSSAR, 

2013). Because of pH and elemental composition, the treated acidic effluent was 

evaluated to be reused within the process, replacing hot water in the EPO-

washer. 

Electrocoagulation of alkaline effluent 
The results of the analysis of the electrocoagulation treatment of the 

alkaline effluent with aluminum electrode is presented in the Figure 5. 

 

 
Figure 5 - Contour profiler of the COD removal with electrocoagulation using 

aluminum electrode 

 

According to the statistical analysis the optimum point for the COD removal 

was obtained when the initial pH is 11, the current density 120 A/m2 and the 

reaction time 50 minutes. At this condition, the COD and color removal was 48% 

and 73%, respectively. Considering the reactor volume and the electrode area, 

the removal of COD and color was 7.2 g/Lm2 and 8.800 CU/Lm2. The obtained 

flocs were well formed, stables compacted and uncolored, they floated with the 

H2 generated in the reaction. The sludge production was 2.1 t/d of sludge.

The reduction of the elements is presented in the Table 5. The amount of 

aluminum increased in the effluent as described by other authors (BOROSKI et al., 

2008; TERRAZAS et al., 2010; BUTLER et al., 2011; SAHU et al., 2014) because of 

the dissolution of the electrode.

The results of the analysis of the electrocoagulation treatment of the 

alkaline effluent with iron electrode is presented in the Figure 6. 

 

 
Figure 6 - Contour profiler of the COD removal with electrocoagulation using iron

According to the statistical analysis, the optimum point for the COD 

removal was obtained when the initial pH was 10, the current density 85 A/m2 

and the reaction time 50 minutes. At this condition, the COD and color removal 

was 43% and 51%, respectively. Considering the reactor volume and the 

electrode area, the removal of COD and color was 7.5 g/Lm2 and 6.800 CU/Lm2.  

The reduction of the heavy metals is presented in Table 6. The color 

removal was lower than the treatment with aluminum electrode because of the 

orange coloring of the effluent due to the presence of Fe(OH).

For the treatment of the alkaline effluent the electrocoagulation with 

aluminum electrode achieved a higher COD and color reduction. Because of 

elemental composition, the treated alkaline effluent was evaluated to be reused 

within the process replacing hot water in the EPO-washer. 

Process simulation and clean water reuse 
The calcium carbonate formation in the (EPO) filtrate can be a critical 

parameter causing operational problems in the bleach plant because of scaling, 

particularly on the pulp washers. In the treated acidic effluent (with EC using 

aluminum electrode), the calcium concentration was higher (5.6 mg/L) than in the 

hot water (1.6 mg/L) and, therefore, it increased when the treated effluent reuse 

increased. Also, a higher concentration of carbonate ions in the treated effluent 

(410 mg/L) compared to hot water (were it could not be detected) increased the 

formation of calcium carbonate in the (EPO) filtrate (Figure 7). 

 
Figure 7 - Calcium carbonate formation in the (EPO) filtrate with hot water 

replacement with treated acidic effluent  
 

In the treated alkaline effluent (EC with aluminum electrode), the calcium 

concentration was lower (0.8 mg/L) than in the treated acidic effluent (5.6 mg/L) 

and in the hot water (1.6 mg/L), therefore, the Ca concentration decreased when 

the treated effluent reuse increased. Also, the concentration of carbonate ions in

the treated effluent (75 mg/L) was lower compared to the treated acidic effluent. 

With 100% of replacement, software simulation indicated that there is not calcium 

carbonate in the (EPO) filtrate. 

In both cases (acidic treated effluent or alkaline treated effluent reuse), 

simulation predicts that 100% replacement of hot water in the EOP press should 

be technically possible (saving 7.5 m3/ADt). Supersaturation calculations indicate 

that the precipitation of calcium carbonate will not start even with 100% of the hot 

water being replaced. 

Effects on the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) 
The characteristics of the treated effluent of the industrial ETP and the 

results of the model simulation with treatment of the acidic effluent (EC with 

aluminum electrode) are presented in Table 8, and the results with treatment of 

the alkaline effluent (EC with aluminum electrode) are presented in Table 9.

In the scenarios where the effluent from EC is sent to the effluent treatment 

plant (Scenarios 2 and 4) it is expected that there will have  a reduction in the 

COD of the final effluent and in the waste sludge production because of the 

decrease of the COD load of the effluent.

In Scenario 3 (EC treatment of the acidic effluent and reuse replacing hot 

water), the COD of the final effluent and the waste sludge production decreased 

in 57% and 36%, respectively, when compared to the reference. In the Scenario 

5 (EC treatment of the alkaline effluent and reuse replacing hot water) the COD 

of the final effluent and the waste sludge production decreased in 50% and 33%, 

respectively, when compared to the reference. In both cases (Scenario 3 and 5) 

the water economy was 7.4 m3/ADt. 

CONCLUSIONS 
 

The main conclusions of this work are: 

i) The best removal of COD and color of the acid effluent was achieved with 
electrocoagulation treatment with aluminum electrode, with a removal of 
COD and color was 8 g/Lm2 and 12.000 CU/Lm2. 

ii) The best removal of COD and color of the alkaline effluent was achieved 
with electrocoagulation treatment with aluminum electrode, with a removal 
of COD and color was 8 g/Lm2 and 8.800 CU/Lm2. 

iii) If treated acidic effluent is reused to replace 100% hot water in the (EPO)-
press the amount of CaCO3 will increase 20 g/ADt but will not achieve the 
supersaturating limit (no precipitation). 

iv) If treated alkaline effluent is reused to replace 100% of hot water in the 
EPO-press it is not expected to have scaling formation by CaCO3 
precipitation. 

v) The reuse of the treated acidic or alkaline effluent within the bleaching 
plant will improve the final effluent characteristics, the biowaste sludge 
generation and the water consumption.  



48 
 

vi) Further studies must be carried to determine the best treatment/disposal 
strategy of the electrocoagulation sludge and the effects of the water reuse 
on the final product. 

vii) Further studies must be carried to determine the impact of the aluminimun 
in the process and the product during treated effluent reuse.

CONCLUSÕES GERAIS 
 

 

 

No capitulo 1, mediante simulação por software foi determinado que é possível 

o reúso do permeado de ultrafiltração do filtrado alcalino. Quando é substituída 

100% da água quente na prensa EPO, aumenta o risco de formação de 

carbonato de cálcio, mas não atinge o nível de supersaturação (precipitação). 

Além, foi determinado que é possível dispor o concentrado da ultrafiltração no

No capitulo 2, foi determinado que o tratamento do filtrado ácido com membranas 

de ultrafiltração é possível e a remoção de DQO e cor foi 65% e 82%, 

respetivamente. O permeado pode substituir a água branca na prensa D0, mas 

com 25% de substituição aumenta em 10% o risco de formação de incrustações 

de sulfato de bário. Neste caso, o DQO do efluente final e a geração de lodo 

biológico na estação de tratamento de efluente diminui em 38 e 36% 

respectivamente. 

 

No capitulo 3, a maior remoção de DQO, cor e metais dos filtrados ácido y 

alcalino foi obtida com o tratamento de eletrocoagulação com eletrodos de 

alumínio. Foi determinado com simulações em software que o 100% da água 

quente pode ser substituída com filtrado ácido ou alcalino tratado sem gerar a 

incrustação de carbonato de cálcio na prensa EOP.  A substituição da água 

quente com alguma corrente interna da fábrica gera uma economia de água de 

7.5 m3/ADt.

ANEXO A 
SCALING MODEL IMPLEMENTATION  

 

 
Inputs and outputs.  

The Pitzer model takes as input the composition a given solution (in terms 

of molality, or moles of component per kg of solvent), as well as several 

thermodynamic parameters to be described. As output, it calculates the activity 

coefficient of each component in solution. 

 

Activities 
Electrolytic solutions are known to deviate considerably from what is 

known as an ideal solution. Under this idealization, the electrostatic interactions 

between the particles of solvent and those of solute - solvent-solute interactions 

- would be identical to solvent-solvent and solute-solute interactions. In order to 

account for such deviations, thermodynamics has introduced the concept of 

activity. Activity is sometimes thought as the effective concentrations that a 

compound in a solution. If the concentration (in molal) of a certain component C 

in solution is , then its activity  is defined as: 

 

 =                                                         EQ 1 
 

where  is known as the activity coefficient of . This coefficient would equal 

unity if the solution were ideal, which is notusually the case. 

 

Model parameters 
The Pitzer model requires that several parameters be provided so that it 

may accurately describe the solutions under study. We may divide them into the 

following ategories:? 

a) Electrolyte-specific parameters: Parameters related to each specific 
electrolyte present in the system (e.g. Na2SO4, NaOH, etc.). There are 

six such parameters, namely 1, 2, 0, 1, 2 and .   

b) Ion interaction parameters: These parameters measure the effect of 
electrical interactions that occur between pairs and triplets of ions 

(binary and ternary interactions, respectively). The number of these 



54 
 

parameters grows with the number of types of ions in the system, as 

more combina- tions will be possible. The binary interaction parameters 

are often written as ,  ? , whereas the ternary parameters are written 

as ? .  

 

Equilibrium data 
In order to determine the solubility of a given electrolyte it is necessary to 

know the value of its solubility product, , under the conditions to which it is 

exposed. These data were obtained from the following sources: (Zemaitis, Clark, 

Rafal, &amp;amp; Scrivner, 1986), (Tester &amp;amp; M., 1997).  

 

Validation results  
To check whether the model implementation was correct, the mean activity 

coefficient, ±, of solutions of NaCl and Na2SO4 was calculated and compared 

with values found in Zemaitis et al. (1986). These solutions were of varying 

molalities, ranging from 0.01 to 4 mol/kg. The results obtained are displayed in 

Figures 1 and 2. As would be expected, the model yields mean activity 

coefficients that are quite close to the expected values for relatively low 

concentrations. However, as the concentration increases, the model displays 

slight deviations from the expected values.

circles corre- spond to data extracted from Zemaitis et al. (1986).

circles correspond to data extracted from Zemaitis et al. (1986).  

 
Temperature dependence of Ksp 

 

In order to account for the effect of temperature on the solubility of burkeite 

the values of Ksp for both sodium sulfate and sodium carbonate were calculated 

from experimental solubility data (Linke &amp;amp; Seidell, 1965), (Shi &amp;amp; Ronald, 2001). 

Once these values were obtained, they were normalized with respect to the value 

corresponding to 115 °C, yielding relative values of Ksp. Mathematically:  

 

ps ( ) = ( ) / k  (115 ° )                      EQ 2 
 

The values of relative Ksp of both sodium sulfate and are very close, 

especially for temperatures greater than 110 °C. These results are in accordance 

with what has been found by Wadsborn (2005). The graph displays decreasing 

values of relative Ksp (and, therefore, decreasing solubilities) for both salts, which 

is also to be expected from solubility data data (Linke &amp;amp; Seidell, 1965), (Shi &amp;amp; 

Ronald, 2001).

Application-programming interface.  
The WinGEMS block was developed through the Block Development Kit 

(BDK) application-programming interface (API), specifically designed to allow 

users to create their own specialized blocks. BKD consists of a collection of static 

libraries, header and source C++ files that, when compiled into a dynamic-link 

library (DLL), provide the subroutines to be called by the custom block.  

 

For a WinGEMS block to be implemented, two files are necessary: 

a) Block DLL: the DLL generated by WinGEMS BDK upon compilation, 
encapsulating all subroutines involved in the calculations performed by 

the block. Most of the work involved in designing a block comes from 

generating this file.  

b) WGB file: a text file that specifies the target DLL to be sought by 
WinGEMS, the input labels made available to the user through the 

graphical user interface (GUI), as well as the input type and units, such 

as °C, cal/s, etc.  

 

Upon initialization, WinGEMS reads the WGB file, which provides it with 

infor- mation on how to manipulate the DLL corresponding to the block (Figure 

3). When a simu- lation is performed, WinGEMS calls the target DLL and reads 

its result as many times as required by the user. 

 

 
Figure 3 – WinGEMS reads the WGB file upon initialization. Once a simulation 

begins, it then calls the target DLL as many times as necessary.

Equilibrium calculations 
The solubilities of the following electrolytes are considered when 

performing calculations:  

? Burkeite - 2(Na2SO4)(Na2CO3) ? 

? CaCO3 ? 

? CaC2O4 ? 

? Na2C2O4 ? 

? Mg(OH)2? 

 

 The equilibrium equations corresponding to the dissolution (or precipitation) of 

these compounds are the following. ? 

 
 

The values  measure the advancements of each reaction. These 

reactions are associated to the following mass balances.  

 

 
Since experimental data is available for burkeite precipitation, the burkeite 

calculations were conducted first and taken as the basis from which all other 

concentrations were found. These calculations allowed for the calculation of 



58 
 

CO32?,SO42? and Na+ concentrations. 
The concentrations of the remaining electrolytes were calculated using 

these values as inputs: from the concentration of CO32?, the concentrations of 

Ca2+ was determined. The Mg2+ ions were treated separately and its solubility 

product was assumed constant due to lack of experimental data. No Pitzer 

parameters were found for calcium and sodium oxalate. For that reason, they 

were assumed not to precipitate. The ion pairs and trios whose binary and ternary 

in- teractions were considered are shown in Table 1.  

 

 
Table 1 – Binary and ternary interactions considered in equilibrium calculations.  

 

The following Ksp expressions were used: 

 
 

These Ksp data were calculated from (Green &amp;amp; Frattali, 1946) and directly 

extracted from (Plummer &amp;amp; Busenberg, 1981).  

 
Using the WinGEMS block 

The model described above was implemented as a WinGEMS block that 

takes one stream as input and one stream. It does not modify the input stream in 

any way and displays its calculation results in the Current Values tab that can be 

found in the Edit block menu. The block reads the composition of the input stream 

and takes it as input for its calculations. The block is currently able to read the 

concentrations all components, except for that of Mg2+, due to limitations of 



59 
 

WinGEMS BDK and that of CO2?, which is not considered in WinGEMS. These 

have to be input manually in the Initial Values tab.?It is crucial that the stream 

variables are set with the correct units. These are shown in Table 2. 

 

Table 2 – Correct units in which the stream variables are to be set.  

 
Once the block is connected and calcium and oxalate concentrations are defined 

(if necessary), WinGEMS run normally.
