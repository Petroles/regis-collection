ABSTRACT

An evolutionary model is proposed for the Caravelas strandplain. The model encompasses integration of:

(i) mapping of Quaternary deposits, (ii) cartography of beach-ridge alignments and their truncations, (iii)

relative sea-level history, (iv) development history of the Abrolhos coral reefs, (v) vibra-coring and (vi) C14

dating of Quaternary deposits. Seven major evolutionary stages were identified. These stages show that the

strandplain has had its Quaternary evolution strongly controlled by relative sea-level changes. In addition,

the development of the Abrolhos coral reefs has also played an important role in dispersion and accumulation

of sediments along the coastline, causing localized inversion in longshore sediment transport.

Key words: coastal evolution, sea-level fluctuations, sedimentary facies, coastal geomorphology.

I INTRODUCTION

The Caravelas strandplain is located in the southern

Bahia State (Fig. 1). It has an area of approximately

800 km2 and is bordered by the Tablelands of the

Barreiras Formation (Upper Tertiary).

This strandplain has had its Quaternary evo-

lution strongly controlled by relative sea-level

changes. Contrary to other strandplains present

along the east coast of Brasil such as the Jequiti-

nhonha-BA and the Doce-ES, situated respectively

north and south of Caravelas, the latter has no asso-

ciation with a major river (Dominguez 1983, 1987,

Martin et al. 1984a, b).

The Caravelas strandplain fronts a wide conti-

nental shelf, extending up to 246 km offshore. The

Abrolhos reefs present on this shelf comprise the

largest and richest reef complex of the South Atlantic

Ocean (Fig. 2). During the Quaternary evolution of

the Caravelas strandplain, the development of these

coral reefs in association with changes in relative

sea-level have played an important role in dispersion

and accumulation of sediments along the coastline.

In this aspect, the evolution of the Caravelas strand-

plain presents peculiarities that distinguish it from

other Brazilian strandplains.

The aim of this paper is to present a geologic-

geomorphologic evolutionary model for this strand-

plain. This evolutionary model provides us a better

understanding of the structure and functioning of

the Caravelas coastal systems, as well as helps us in

predicting future coastal behavior.

The general approach used in this paper was to

combine data from several sources of information:

(i) mapping of Quaternary deposits; (ii) cartogra-

phy of beach-ridge alignments and truncations; (iii)

cartography of chênier-type sand bodies; (iv) rel-

ative sea-level history (Martin et al. 1980, 1999);

(v) development history of the Abrolhos coral reefs

(Leão et al. 2000, Leão and Kikuchi 1999, 2000);

(vi) vibra-coring and (vii) C14 dating of Quaternary

deposits.

II RELATIVE SEA-LEVEL HISTORY FOR THE EAST
BRAZILIAN COAST

During the Late Quaternary, the east coast of Brazil

was affected by two important relative sea-level fluc-

tuations. At least two phases of higher stand than

present sea-level have been identified for the last

123,000 years B.P. (Suguio et al. 1985, Dominguez

et al. 1987, Martin et al. 1987). The Penultimate

Transgression (Bittencourt et al. 1979) reached a

maximum around 123,000 years B.P., when sea-

level was positioned 8 ± 2 meters above the present
level (Martin et al. 1980). The subsequent regres-

sive event extended up to 18,000 years B.P., when

sea-level reached a minimum of 100-120 meters be-

low the present level. The most recent transgressive

episode, which initiated around 18,000 years B.P.,

is known as the Last Transgression (Bittencourt et

al. 1979) and reached a maximum approximately

5,600 cal. years B.P. (5,200 years C14 B.P.). This

last event left several records that were dated by the

C14 method, allowing the construction of relative

sea-level curves for the last 7,700 cal. years B.P.

(7,000 years C14 B.P.) (Suguio et al. 1985, Martin

et al. 1987, 1999, 2002) (Fig. 3).

The relative sea-level curve built for the Sal-

vador region (Fig. 3A) is by far the most detailed of

the entire eastern-northeastern coast of Brazil

Fig. 2 – Morphology of the continental shelf adjacent to the Caravelas strandplain (modified from

Dominguez et al. 1998).

(Suguio et al. 1985, Martin et al. 1987, 1988,

Suguio et al. 1988, Martin et al. 2002). Martin

et al. (2002) have recently presented a new ver-

sion of this curve incorporating corrections for the

reservoir effect and, calibrations for calendar ages

(Fig. 3B). The number of relative sea-level recon-

structions for the Caravelas region was insufficient

for the construction of a complete curve (Fig. 3C).

Nevertheless, the reconstructions obtained for the

Caravelas region are in agreement with the Salvador

curve (Suguio et al. 1985, Martin et al. 1987).

The Salvador curve exhibits an important highstand

(4, 8 ± 0, 5 meters) around 5,600 cal. years B.P.
(5,200 years C14 B.P.), followed by a drop since

that time. This drop was not continuous, but in-

terrupted by two high-frequency oscillations. Af-

ter 5,600 cal. years B.P. (5,200 years C14 B.P.),

a rapid regression occurred and the sea-level went

down reaching a level a little lower than the present

one. Between 3,800 and 3,500 years cal B.P. (3,900

and 3,600 years C14 B.P.), a rapid transgression oc-

curred. Around 3,500 cal. years B.P. (3,600 years

C14 B.P.), the relative sea-level reached a second

maximum placing it over 3, 5 ± 0, 5 meters above
the present level. Between 3,500 and 2,800 years cal

B.P. (3,600 and 2,800 years C14 B.P.) another regres-

sion occurred and the relative sea-level went down

once again slightly below the present level. Around

2,100 cal. years B.P. (2,400 years C14 B.P.) the rel-

ative sea-level reached a third maximum placing it

2, 5 ± 0, 5 meters above the present one. Since that
time, the relative sea-level has dropped reaching its

present position.

tence of the two high-frequency sea-level oscilla-

tions. According to these authors, most of the in-

dicators used in the determination of the two high-

frequency oscillations comes from mollusks and not

from vermetid incrustations which they consider to

be the best and more precise indicators. Martin et al.

(1998, 2002) however pointed out that Angulo and

Lessa (1997) did not consider that the data from ver-

metid incrustations should be analyzed together with

other biological, sedimentological, archaeological

and morphological indicators, and not isolated as

those authors did.

III RELATIVE SEA-LEVEL HISTORY AND THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE ABROLHOS REEFS

Data obtained from a core taken in the Coroa Ver-

melha reef (Fig. 2) allowed the calculation of the

Abrolhos reefs growth rate. The island surface is

about 1,5 meters above the mean sea-level (Leão

1982). The Coroa Vermelha core reached a total

depth of 15,2 meters. The top of the pre-holocenic

sequence was found at 11,2 meters below the present

mean sea-level. Datings of corals collected in differ-

ent depths in relation to the present mean sea-level

provided ages of 7,371(7,219)7,096 cal. years B.P.
(?11 meters), 5,728(5,605)5,485 cal. years B.P.
(?8, 5 meters) and 4,527(4,415)4,287 cal. years
B.P. (?2, 4 meters). A sample dated from the reef
border provided an age over 1,683(1,538)1,504 cal.
years B.P. (Leão and Kikuchi 1999).

The comparison between the Salvador curve

and the Coroa Vermelha reef growth rates evidenced

four major stages in reef development (Leão and

Kikuchi 1999, 2000, Leão et al. 2000) (Fig. 4):

Stage A (initial reef establishment stage) – the old-
est age from the Coroa Vermelha core indicates that

the corals started its growth a little before 7,700 cal.

years B.P., during a sea-level rise period (Last Trans-

gression). The reef growth rate in this stage was

small, around 1,5 mm/year.

Stage B (rapid vertical accretion of the reefs) – this
stage is associated with the regression that occurred

after the maximum of the Last Transgression and it

is characterized by a rapid reef growth, with rates in

the order of 5,5 mm/year. The corals dated from the

top of the Coroa Vermelha core (4,527(4,415)4,287
cal. years B.P.) indicate that by this time these reefs

reached the present mean sea-level.

Stage C (lateral growth of the reefs) – the vertical
accretion of the reefs stopped when they reached

sea-level. Since that time, the reefs have had their

tops truncated and started growing sideways. The

age of 1,683(1,538)1,504 years cal B.P., obtained
from the border of the reef, which is younger than the

one from the top corroborates the statement above.

Stage D (reef degradation) – this stage is marked
by a decline of the reef growth which persists to the

present day.

IV CLIMATIC AND OCEANOGRAPHIC
PARAMETERS

Wind and Wave Patterns

The Trade Wind Belt of the South Atlantic (NE-E-

SE) and the periodic advanced of the Atlantic Po-

lar Front (SSE) are important elements of the atmo-

spheric circulation on the coastal zone of the State

of Bahia. The area is reached by winds arising from

NE and E during the spring-summer and from SE

and E during the autumn-winter. These winds and

the morphology of the inner continental shelf are

responsible for the generation of the wave-patterns

that reach the coastline: (i) wave-fronts coming from

NE and E, with height of 1,0 meter and period of 5

seconds and (ii) wave-fronts coming from SE and

SSE, with height of 1,5 meter and period of 6,5

seconds (Dominguez et al. 1992, Bittencourt et al.

2000).

Tides

Tidal regime at the Caravelas strandplain is semi-

diurnal and located at the upper microtidal range

which is close to 2 meters. Spring tidal range at

the Ilhéus port located 300 km north of the city of

Caravelas is 2,5 meters (DHN 1998).

V GEOLOGY-GEOMORPHOLOGY OF THE
CARAVELAS STRANDPLAIN

Five major geologic-geomorphological units were

mapped in the Caravelas strandplain (Fig. 5): pleis-

tocene beach-ridge terraces, lagoonal deposits,

holocene beach-ridge terraces, freshwater marshes

and tidal flats/mangroves.

The Caravelas strandplain is bordered land-

ward by unconsolidated Tertiary alluvial fan

deposits of the Barreiras Group. These deposits

are made up of poorly sorted sand-clay sediments,

slightly cemented by iron oxide. Altitudes vary

from 10 to 100 meters. A line of inactive sea cliffs

marks the limit between these Tablelands and the

strandplain. North and south of this strandplain the

Tablelands of the Barreiras Group reach the shore-

line forming active sea cliffs such as in Mucuri and

Prado (Fig. 1).

Pleistocene Beach-Ridge Terraces

These terraces occur in the internal portion of the

strandplain, with altitudes varying from 6 to 10 me-

ters. They present on its surface remnants of beach-

ridge. Truncation lines separate different sets of

beach-ridges. These terraces are made up of white

to brown, medium to coarse-grained, well sorted

sands. Soil processes gave origin to a horizon ce-

mented by humic acids located 3 to 4 meters below

the surface. Martin et al. (1982), based on Io/U

dating from coral fragments collected from the base

of terraces with these characteristics in the region

of Olivença, Ilhéus (BA), attributed an age of over

123,000 years B.P. to these terraces. The only avail-

able dating for this unit at the Caravelas strandplain

is from shells collected in a mud layer located at

the base of the Pleistocene Beach-Ridge Terraces,

which provided an age of over 32,000 years B.P.

(B-246) (Fig. 5, Table I).

Lagoonal Terraces

Ancient lagoonal deposits occur mainly in the south-

western portion of the Caçumba Island forming a ter-

race approximately 1,0 meter above the maximum

of the high spring tide level. This unit is made up

of gray to brown muddy sediments, moderately con-

solidated, exhibiting mollusk shells (mostly oysters)

in life position. C14 dating of these shells provided

ages around 7,000-5,000 cal. years B.P. (CA92/34B,

CA92/34A, B-258, CA96/00 and CA96/03) (Fig. 5,

Table I).

Holocene Beach-Ridge Terraces

These terraces occupy a large extension of the

Caravelas strandplain exhibiting altitudes varying

from some decimeters to up to 6 meters. Contrary

to their Pleistocene counterparts, in the Holocene

Terraces the beach-ridges are narrow and very well

delineated, and separated by low zones, many times

occupied by freshwater wetlands. Truncation lines

separate the different sets of beach-ridges. These

terraces are made up of fine to medium yellow-

ish sands. Plane-parallel lamination dipping gen-

tly seaward is the dominant sedimentary structure.

At the Caçumba Island, 3 meters thick beach

sands rest directly on the top of plastic gray mud

of shoreface origin evidenced by the presence of

hummocky cross beddings. 14C dating of mollusks

shells present in these terraces provided ages

around 5,000-3,000 cal. years B.P. (B-260, B-316,

B-317, CA92/11D). Two radiocarbon datings of

bivalve mollusks shell fragments, collected in

the low-lying zones coincident with an im-

portant beach-ridge truncation, presented ages of

4,799(4,531)4,445 cal. years B.P. (CA96/29) and
2,353(2,344)2,331 cal. years B.P. (CA96/30). Other
datings from shells collected in the shoreface gray

muds referred above provided ages varying from

8,000 to 4,000 cal. years B.P. (B-255, B-261, B-

262, CA92/30B, B-242, CA96/13A’, CA92/14B,

CA92/11C and B-264). Dated wood fragments pro-

vided ages varying from 6,500 to 4,000 cal. years

B.P. (B-265, CA92/30B*, B-241A and B-241B)

(Fig. 5, Table I).

Tidal Flats / Mangroves

The southern portion of the Caravelas strandplain

is characterized by the presence of large tidal flats

cut by numerous tidal creeks. Mangrove swamps

comprised of Rhizophora, Laguncularia, Avicennia

and Terminalia has colonized the upper intertidal

areas. 14C datings of wood and oysters shells col-

lected along the Caçumba island shoreline where

these tidal flat deposits presently outcrop provided

ages around 700-500 cal. years B.P. (CA96/16A,

CA96 / 18A, CA96 / 17C, CA96 / 18B and CA96 /

20A). In these tidal flats isolated shell-rich sandy

chêniers are common. Datings of shells from re-

worked bivalve mollusks, collected on the surface

of these chêniers, provided ages varying from

800 to 300 cal. years B.P. (CA92/17C, CA96/17B,

CA96/19 and CA96/22) (Fig. 5, Table I).

Freshwater Marshes

The freshwater marshes and associated deposits oc-

cupy mainly the low-lying areas that separate the

Pleistocene from the Holocene Beach-Ridge Ter-

races, the swales between individual beach-ridges

and valleys and riverine areas of the Tablelands.

Plastic muddy sediments, rich in organic matter, in

most cases constitute these deposits. Exception is

made for the beach-ridge swales, where the substra-

tum is sandy. A peat layer with variable thickness

is sometimes present on the top of this unit. Typical

freshwater wetland vegetation grows in these areas.

VI FACIES ASSOCIATIONS

Twelve vibracores were retrieved from the Caravelas

strandplain. Nine sedimentary facies were identified

from the integration of vibracore and outcrop infor-

mation based on sediment texture, mollusks species

and sedimentary structures (Figs. 5, 6, 7 and 8).

These facies were grouped into two major facies as-

sociations (Andrade 2000): (i) littoral zone (A1, A2,

A3 and A4) and (ii) lagoon/freshwater wetlands zone

(B1, B2, B3, B4 and B5). The different facies and

the interpretation of their depositional environment

are described below.

VI.1 Littoral Zone Facies Association

VI.1.1 Facies A1

This facies was identified only in outcrops. It rests

on top of the facies A2 in vibracores 3 and 5 and ex-

hibit thickness varying from 2,8 to 4,0 meters. This

facies is characterized by fine to medium yellow-

ish quartz sand, including localized concentration

of heavy minerals and shells. The dominant sedi-

mentary structure is plane-parallel bedding dipping

gently towards the sea (Figs. 6 and 7). 14C dat-

ings of mollusks shells collected from an outcrop

near vibracore 3 provided ages of 4,800-4,200 cal.

years B.P. (CA92/11-D and B-260) (Figs. 5 and 6,

Table I). This facies was interpreted as a result of de-

position in a beach-face environment based on the

sedimentary structures observed and on the presence

of beach-ridges capping the studied outcrops.

VI.1.2 Facies A2

This facies occurs in vibracores 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12 and

13. It is comprised by gray to orange medium sands,

with interbedded fine to coarse sands and mud. Lay-

ers of detritus organic matter were observed in vibra-

cores 1, 5 and 8. The dominant sedimentary struc-

tures are tabular and trough cross bedding and plane-

parallel bedding. Bioturbation is rare, except in vi-

bracores 1, 3 and 5, where vertical tubes filled with

clay and sands are present. The following bivalves

were identified: Anomalocardia brasiliana, Mulinia

cleryana, Glycimeris longior, Chione subrostrata,

Lunarca ovalis (Figs. 6, 7 and 8). According to Rios

(1985) these shells are indicative of sandy shallow

water environments. C14 datings of shells and wood

debris provided ages varying from 4,100 to 7,900

years cal B.P. (CA92/11-C, B-261, B-262, B-241A,

B-241B, B-242, CA96/13A’, B-254, CA92/14B, B-

255, CA96-13/150-152 cm) (Figs. 5, 6, 7 and 8,

Tables I and II). This facies is interpreted as a result

of deposition in a sandy shoreface environment (surf

zone and shallower portions of the shoreface), due

to the following evidences: i) sediment texture, ii)

cross bedding (the result of longshore and rip cur-

rents typical of the surf zone, and iii) stratigraphy

(position of this facies, situated immediately below

the facies A1 – beach-face).

VI.1.3 Facies A3

This facies is present in vibracores 1, 2, 3, 11 and

12 and is made up of interbedded layers of light to

dark gray muds (thickness from 5 to 8 cm) and fine

gray sands (thickness varying from a few millime-

ters to over 4 cm) forming various arrangements of

wavy and linsen bedding. The mud layers are lo-

cally enriched with mica minerals. Low-angle cross

bedding and parallel lamination are also present.

Bioturbation occurs mainly in vibracores 3, 11 and

12. Mollusk shells are rare in this facies, except

in vibracores 11 and 12, where a shell bed is ob-

served. Species of mollusks shells present include:

Mulinia cleryana, Chione subrostrata and Mactra

iheringi (Figs. 6 and 8). Radiocarbon dating of

shells provided ages around 6,300-5,300 years cal

B.P. (CA96-11/469cm and CA96-12/408-413cm)

(Figs. 5, 6 and 8, Table II). This facies is the result of

deposition in a muddy shoreface environment based

on the following evidences: i) sediment texture, ii)

stratigraphic position, immediately below facies A2

(sandy shoreface) and iii) dominance of wavy and

linsen beddings.

VI.1.4 Facies A4

This facies occurs in vibracore 2 and is character-

ized by medium to coarse sands. The sedimentary

structures are represented by trough cross bedding

intercalated with plane-parallel bedding (Fig. 6).

This facies is interpreted as having been deposited

in an ebb-tidal delta environment as evidenced by: i)

sediment texture, ii) dominance of trough cross bed-

ding, iii) geographical position where the vibracore

was collected; in the present day shoreface, near to

a tidal creek mouth.

QUATERNARY EVOLUTION OF THE CARAVELAS STRANDPLAIN 367

VI.2 Lagoon and Freshwater Wetland

Facies Association

VI.2.1 Facies B1

This facies is present in vibracores 1, 11 and 13 and

it is characterized by gray-yellowish to dark gray

muds. The top of this facies is characterized by the

presence of whitish roots in vertical position. A peat

layer, with thickness varying from a few centimeters

to half meter, caps this facies (Figs. 6 and 8). In vi-

bracore 13, radiocarbon dating from the base of the

peat layer supplied an age around 1,175(1,067)977
cal. years B.P. (CA96-13/69-72 cm) (Figs. 5 and

8, Table II). This facies is interpreted as the result

of deposition in a freshwater wetland environment

due to the similarity between the remnant vegetable

matter present in the vibracore and those found in

the present day freshwater wetlands, where the vi-

bracores were taken.

VI.2.2 Facies B2

This facies is characterized by yellowish-brownish

to dark gray muds that occur in the top of vibracores

4, 7, 9 and 10. Sedimentary structures are not visible

(Figs. 6, 7 and 8). This facies is interpreted as

having being deposited in a supratidal environment,

where these vibracores were taken.

VI.2.3 Facies B3

Plastic muds of yellowish-brown and gray color

characterize this facies, present in vibracores 1, 3,

7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. The presence of intraclasts is

observed in vibracore 7. Sedimentary structures of

physical origin were not observed. Cylindrical tubes

present in this facies are filled with sand or mud.

Remnants of plant matter characterized by brownish

fibrous roots both in vertical and horizontal position

occur throughout this facies, and are very similar to

the present day mangroves rootlets. Mollusks shells

are virtually absent and restricted to: Anomalocar-

dia brasiliana, Corbula cubaniana and Chione sub-

rostrata (Figs. 6, 7 and 8). According to Rios (1985)

all of these shells can inhabit muddy environments.

Radiocarbon dating of mollusks shells collected in

this facies provided ages varying from 6,400 to 7,900

years cal B.P. (CA96/00, CA96-3/676-678cm,

CA92/34-A and CA92/34-B) (Fig. 5, 6, 7 and 8,

Tables I and II). Mollusks shells from vibracore 11

however presented an age of 1,310(1,290)1,273 cal.
years B.P. (CA96-11/ 70 cm).

This facies is interpreted as having been de-

posited in an intertidal environment, colonized by

mangroves. This interpretation was based on the

presence of: (i) fibrous roots similar to the ones as-

sociated with present day mangroves; (ii) absence of

sedimentary structures of physical origin; (iii) mol-

lusks species and (iv) sediment texture.

VI.2.4 Facies B4

This facies was found in vibracores 4, 10 and 11 and

it has been subdivided into two sub-facies (Figs. 6

and 8):

Sub-Facies B4a: corresponds to the lower portion
of the facies B4. It is made up of cross bedding sands

locally exhibiting flaser bedding. Bioturbation is

present as vertical tubes filled with sand. Intraclasts

were also observed. The mollusks shells although

rare are represented by the Corbula cubaniana and

Diplodonta punctada.

Sub-Facies B4b: It corresponds to the upper por-
tion of facies B4. This sub-facies was differentiated

from the sub-facies B4a because it is predominantly

muddy, exhibiting a typical linsen bedding. The

bioturbation increases towards the top, where the

sand and clay are quite mixed, which causes diffi-

culty in the individualization of the sand and mud

lenses. The mollusks shells are also rare, and repre-

sented by: Diplodonta punctada, Mulinia cleryana

and Corbula cubaniana.

The facies B4 was interpreted as the result of

infilling of a tidal creek. This interpretation was

based on the following criteria: i) presence of flaser

and linsen bedding, ii) fining upwards of sediment

grain size, iii) dominance of cross bedding in the

lower portion of the lithofacies and iv) presence of

intraclasts.

VI.2.5 Facies B5

This facies occurs in vibracores 9 and 13. In vi-

bracore 9, it has more than 3 meters of thickness

and it is made up of a massive gray clay (Figs. 7

and 8). Organic sediments dated from this facies in

vibracore 13 provided an age of 2,338(2,317)2,153
years B.P. (CA96-13/134-136cm) (Figs. 5 and 8,

Table II). This facies was interpreted as a result of

clay deposition, in a subtidal environment with calm

waters, probably inside a lagoon.

VII QUATERNARY COASTAL EVOLUTION

The evolutionary model proposed for the Caravelas

strandplain (Andrade 2000) is described below:

Stage I: Construction of the Pleistocene Strand-
plain – after 120,000 years B.P. (Fig. 9)

This stage corresponds to the regressive event that

followed the maximum of the Penultimate Tran-

gression (123,000 years B.P.) (Martin et al. 1980).

During this period, the sediments reworked from

the inner continental shelf, as a result of a rela-

tive sea-level drop, in association with those brought

into the area by longshore currents favored progra-

dation of the coastline through the successive ac-

cretion of beach-ridges, giving origin to the Pleis-

tocene Beach-Ridge Terraces. The paleogeographic

reconstruction depicted in Fig. 9 shows that the

coastline exhibited a great lateral continuity and was

made up of sandy beaches. The general configura-

tion of the Pleistocene coastline was very similar

to the present day coastline orientation, reflecting

the presence of offshore obstacles such as the Par-

cel das Paredes coral reefs. Analysis of beach-ridge

alignments show progradational phases intercalated

with erosional episodes as evidenced by the pres-

longshore transport direction, as indicated by sandy

spit growth, are also observed.

Stage II: Drowning of the Pleistocene Strand-
plain during the Last Transgression (5,600 cal.
years B.P./5,200 years C14 B.P.) (Fig. 10)

The sea-level rise that occurred after the last glacial

period reached its maximum around 5,600 cal. years

B.P. (5,200 years C14 B.P.), favoring the drowning

of the pleistocene strandplain, with partial erosion

and reworking of the Pleistocene Beach-Ridge Ter-

races. As a result a barrier island/lagoon system

was formed. The paleo-geographical reconstruc-

tion of the strandplain by that time shows the ex-

istence of two lagoonal systems: one located in

the southern sector (Lagoonal System I) and the

other in the northern sector of the Caravelas strand-

rier island/lagoon system was already present before

the maximum of the Last Transgression (5,600 cal.

years B.P. or 5,200 years C14 B.P.). Strong evidence

to the presence of a lagoon around 7,700 cal. years

B.P. (7,000 years C14 B.P.) was found in vibracore 3,

retrieved from the southern sector of the strandplain.

Shells collected in the mangroves facies (B3) near to

the contact with the superimposed foreshore facies

(A3) provided an age of 7,913(7,896,7,838)7,802
cal. years B.P. (CA96-3A/676-678 cm). The sea-

level by that time can be reconstructed, based on in-

formation from that vibracore, as being positioned

6,7 meters below the present sea-level, since the

mangrove facies (B3) which accumulated in an in-

tertidal zone is now located about 6,7 meters below

its modern equivalent.

Another important aspect to be pointed out

is the presence by that time, of a Paleo-Ponta do

Catoeiro in the barrier island chain that protected

the lagoonal system I. This cape-like form of the

coastline is probably the result of the influence of

the Coroa Vermelha, Viçosa and Sebastião Gomes

reefs on the wave refraction-diffraction patterns in

shaping the barrier island chain. At the lagoonal

system II, the southern tip of the barrier island was

anchored in the paleo-Ponta da Baleia cape and ex-

tended northwards as a result of the dominant long-

shore drift. A general north-directed longshore drift

affected almost the entire coastline of the barrier is-

land system by that time.

Finally at the northern portion of the Caravelas

strandplain a strong inflection of the paleo-coastline

towards the continent is observed on both sides of

the paleo-mouth of the Itanhém River. This probably

reflects a larger importance of the tidal currents in

modeling this coastline, due to the existence of a

ment Situated Between the Paleo-Ponta da Baleia
and the Ponta do Catoeiro (5,600 cal. years B.P.
or 5,200 years C14 B.P.) (Fig. 11)

The sea-level drop after the maximum of the Last

Transgression (5,600 cal. years B.P. or 5,200 years

C14 B.P.) favored coastline progradation. Appar-

ently, this progradation happened first in the em-

bayment situated between the Ponta da Baleia and

the Ponta do Catoeiro. This progradation took place

following two phases:

(i) infilling of the concave sector (embayment).

The orientation and parallelism of the beach-

ridges in this sector suggest that the prograda-

tion of the coastline has had essentially a tra-

verse component.

(ii) Afterwards, the progradation acquired a char-

acter essentially longitudinal, with the growth

of a sandy spit indicating a longshore sediment

transport directed towards the northeast. As

a result of the infilling of the embayment, the

coastline became more rectilinear in the south-

ern portion of the strandplain.

In other sectors of the strandplain, the coastline

did not progradated at first in a significant way. With

the progressive drop of sea-level, the lagoonal sys-

tems (I and II) have lost contact with the sea, being

replaced by fresh-water wetlands.

Stage IV: Beginning of the Sedimentation in the
Northern Sector of the Caravelas Strandplain
(Fig. 12)

This stage is marked by the beginning of the sed-

imentation in the northern sector of the Caravelas

strandplain. This stage marks a major change in

the dominant longshore drift direction in the north-

ern sector of the strandplain. Firstly, this dominant

direction was northeastwards and later changed to

southwards. A possible reason for this inversion

could be the emersion of the internal arch of coral

reefs as a result of sea-level drop. This emersion

has blocked in a significant way the propagation of

the southeast waves into the northern sector. As this

376 ANA C. S. ANDRADE ET AL.

happened the northeastern waves became more ef-

fective in determining the dominant longshore drift

direction, therefore originating an inversion in the

net longshore transport direction in this sector.

In the southern sector of the strandplain, shore-

face sediments (facies A2) with ages varying from

7,900 to 5,900 cal. years B.P. are recovered by

beach-face sediments (facies A1, 4,500-5,500 cal.

years B.P.). The littoral sands in this sector probably

comprise a composite sequence in which the basal

portion has accumulated during the Last Transgres-

sion, but before its maximum (Stage II); while the

upper portion has accumulated in the subsequent re-

gressive phase.

By that time the paleo-coastline presented a

general southwest-northeast orientation, south of the

Ponta da Baleia, and southeast-northwest, north of

that feature. Two major capes, represented by the

paleo-Ponta da Baleia and the paleo-Ponta do Cato-

eiro were present. This general shoreline orientation

is in conformity with the present coastal processes.

The coastline contour was strongly influenced

by offshore obstacles such as the Coroa Vermelha

reefs, the Sebastião Gomes reefs, the Viçosa reefs

and the Parcel das Paredes coral reefs. After a pe-

riod of slow growth during 7,700-5,600 cal years

B.P./7,000-5,200 years C14 B.P, the reef community

then presented a rapid vertical accretion, with accu-

mulation rates over 5,5 meters/1000 years (Leão et

al. 2000). The rapid vertical growth of the reefs,

concomitant to the progressive sea-level drop, al-

lowed probably, the subaerial exposition of the reefs

since around 4,000 cal. years B.P. and the trunca-

tion of their tops by wave action. As a result the

reefs started to grow sideways (Leão 1982, Leão et

al. 2000). From that time on, the reefs of the in-

ternal arch started to play a more important role in

the coastal dynamics, resulting in an inversion in the

dominant longshore drift as discussed above.

The study of beach-ridge orientation in the

northern sector of the strandplain indicates that dur-

ing the Holocene, important shifts in longshore drift

direction have occurred, generating truncations in

beach-ridge alignment (Fig. 12-A). These trunca-

tions might have resulted from changes in waves

climate.

On the other hand, the sedimentation style at

the strandplain in the neighborhood of the present

Ponta do Catoeiro cape can be described in the fol-

lowing way (Fig. 12-B): at the cape position the

paleo-coastline bent abruptly continentwards, cre-

ating an embayment. The tendency of the coast-

line is to maintain its lateral continuity (Swift 1975,

Dominguez 1987). In this way, the beach fed by the

longshore drift from southwest, trying to maintain

its lateral continuity, would extend into the embay-

ment. As a result of this process, sandy spits were

formed and they were elongated more and more

towards the northeast. While the spits extended

into the open ocean, the refraction of the southeast

waves pushed the spit towards the embayment, until

its northern extremity was welded to the mainland

coastline in the concave sector. This process cre-

ated narrow elongated lagoons, separated from the

ocean by spits. These elongated lagoons constitute

the low-lying areas occupied by wetlands that sepa-

rate the beach-ridges sets in the vicinity of the Ponta

do Catoeiro cape. The sedimentary record in vibra-

core 11 shows the progressive isolation of one of

those lagoons. In this vibracore grain size decreases

upwards in association with the following succes-

sion of sedimentary facies from base to top: muddy

shoreface facies (A3), tidal channel facies (B4a), in-

tertidal or mangrove facies (B3), freshwater marsh

facies (B1) and peat.

Stage V: The erosional episode associated with
the 2,100 cal. years B.P. (2,400 years C14 B.P.)
rapid rise in relative sea-level (Fig. 13)

During the Holocene, the coastline prograda-

tion didn’t occur in a continuous manner. It was

marked by erosional episodes associated to: (i) tidal

channel dynamics, (ii) fluctuations in relative sea-

level and (iii) changes in longshore drift direction.

These episodes were recorded in the strandplain as

truncations in beach-ridge alignments. The most

dramatic erosional episode recorded in the strand-

plain is the one shown on figure 13 which resulted

years B.P. (2,400 years C14 B.P.), as depicted in the

Salvador sea-level curve. The radicarbon ages of

2,338(2,317)2,153 cal. years B.P (CA96-13/134-
136 cm) (vibracore 13) from vegetable debris col-

lected from the lagoonal facies (B5) that infill the

low-lying area associated with the beach-ridge trun-

cation referred above and 2,353(2,344)2,331 cal.
years B.P. (CA 96/30) from shells collected from the

beach-ridge located closest to the truncation seem to

corroborate this interpretation.

Stage VI: Severe Coastal Erosion at Caçumba
Island (Fig. 14)

The erosional episode described above was possi-

bly followed by an intensification of the southward-

directed longshore drift, which favored the displace-

ment of the Caravelas channel as depicted in figure

14. This displacement can be responsible for the

severe erosion that affected the Caçumba Island by

that time. The existence of a possible paleochannel

with a geometry like that presented in the figure 14

is suggested by the presence of a tidal channel facies

(B4a and B4b) in vibracore 10. Mollusks shells col-

lected in the mangrove facies (B3) in vibracore 11

provided an age over 1,310(1,290)1,273 cal. years
B.P. (CA96-11/70 cm). This provides a maximum

age for the paleogeography depicted on figure 14.

Stage VII: Renewed coastline progradation
(Fig. 15)

This final evolutionary stage corresponds to the re-

newed coastline progradation. The growth of the

Ponta da Baleia cape in association with further

emergence of the coral reefs of Sebastião Gomes,

Coroa Vermelha and Viçosa created a low energy

zone in the neighborhood of the Caçumba Island,

favoring the deposition of fine sediments, in exten-

sive tidal flats. As a result, a change in sedimenta-

tion style occurred in this sector of the strandplain,

which began to present characteristics more typical

of a tide-dominated environment.

VIII CONCLUSIONS

This paper has presented the Quaternary evolution

of the Caravelas strandplain. This evolution was

strongly controlled by relative sea-level changes and

the concomitant development of the Abrolhos coral

reefs. Whereas sea-level behavior has controlled

progradation, erosional retreat and barrier island for-

mation at the strandplain, reef development affected

wave refraction/diffraction favoring cape develop-

ment and a significant inversion in longshore direc-

tion. The knowledge of this evolutionary history

represents an important tool for prediction of coastal

zone response to future global changes in climate

and sea-level, therefore allowing better management

of this coastal area.

RESUMO

Um modelo evolutivo foi proposto para a planície costeira

de Caravelas. Este modelo engloba a integração do: (i)

mapeamento dos depósitos Quaternários, (ii) cartografia

dos alinhamentos dos cordões litorâneos e truncamentos

destes, (iii) história do nível relativo do mar, (iv) história

do desenvolvimento dos recifes de corais de Abrolhos,

(v) testemunhos e (vi) datação C14 dos depósitos Quater-

nários. Foram identificados sete principais estágios evo-

lutivos. Estes estágios mostram que a planície costeira

teve sua evolução Quaternária fortemente controlada pelas

variações do nível relativo do mar. Além disso, o de-

senvolvimento dos recifes de corais de Abrolhos também

desempenhou um papel importante na dispersão e acumu-

lação de sedimentos ao longo da costa, causando inversão

no transporte de sedimentos.

Palavras-chave: evolução costeira, variações do nível do

mar, facies sedimentar, geomorfologia costeira.
