SUMMARY
 

 In the last decades, insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are 
becoming more prevalent due to alterations in dietary and life-styles. Posttransplant 
diabetes mellitus (PTDM) has also become a subject of  interest and importance in 
the wake of  increased numbers and survival rates of  solid organ transplantations. 
The liver is deeply involved in the regulation of  whole body glucose and lipid 
homeostasis and hepatic glucose and lipid metabolic disruptions may play a 
central role in the onset of  IR, T2D and PTDM. Changes in hepatic glucose 
and lipid fluxes using stable isotope tracers and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance 
(NMR) analysis both in animal models and patients with IR, T2D or PTDM 
were addressed in this Thesis. Moreover, further developments of  techniques 
for the study of  hepatic glucose metabolism from fasting to dynamic situations 
were challenged as well as for the integrated analysis of  hepatic glucose and lipid 
metabolism.
 In Chapter 1, whole body glucose and lipid metabolism were reviewed 
and integrated focusing on hepatic metabolic disruptions associated with IR and 
diabetes. Moreover, the stable isotope tracers and Magnetic Resonance techniques 
and their applications to hepatic metabolism evaluation were introduced.
 In Chapter 2, fasting sources of  endogenous glucose production (EGP) 
were evaluated in control and high fat (HF) diet induced-IR animal models 
by using [3,4-13C2]glucose and deuterated water (

2H2O) combined with carbon 
13 (13C) and deuterium (2H) NMR spectroscopy. Postabsorptive EGP from 
gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in HF diet-fed animals was essentially 
identical to the normally fed controls. The normal EGP rates found in HF diet-
fed animals suggest that altered hepatic glucose fluxes are not involved in the 
development of  IR secondary to HF diet feeding, at least in the early stages.

 In Chapter 3, sources of  fasting hepatic glucose production (HGP) 
were quantified in kidney transplant patients, undergoing cyclosporine A (CsA) 
immunosuppressant therapy. A novel Bayesian analysis of  the position 2 and 5 
2H NMR signals of  monoacetone glucose derived from urinary acetaminophen 
glucuronide following 2H2O and acetominophen ingestion was proposed for 
quantification of  gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis relative contributions to 
HGP. For kidney transplant patients, the gluconeogenic contribution to HGP 
was significantly increased in the setting of  PTDM. This metabolic alteration 
was found to be most strongly associated with adiposity and increased body 
mass index whereas CsA treatment per se provoked only modest alterations of  
HGP sources and was not shown to be associated with fasting hyperglycemia or 
hyperinsulinemia.
 The fate of  an intraperitoneal (i.p.) glucose load by 13C and 2H NMR 
analysis following administration of  [U-13C]glucose and 2H2O in healthy, HF 
diet-fed and CsA-treated rodents was addressed in Chapter 4. The contribution 
of  HGP to total glucose was determined from the 2H-enrichment of  plasma 
glucose position 2 relative to that of  plasma water and gluconeogenic sources 
were quantified from the 2H-enrichment level at position 5 of  plasma glucose 
relative to that of  plasma water. The i.p. glucose load and “recycled” glucose from 
Cori cycle contributions to total glucose were estimated from the enrichment 
level of  plasma [U- 13C]glucose respective isotopomers relative to that of  the 
load. Sources of  total glucose after an i.p. glucose load were further evaluated in 
HF diet-fed and CsA-treated animals. Both groups of  animals showed impaired 
glucose tolerance (IGT) relative to controls. HF diet did not promote impaired 
contribution from HGP and insulin secretion by pancreatic b-cells was not 
affected. Thus, the IGT of  HF diet-fed animals can be attributed to decreased 
whole body glucose disposal secondary to peripheral insulin resistance rather than 
impaired HGP suppression. With CsA-treated animals the observed IGT was 
associated with a higher HGP contribution to plasma glucose levels, suggesting 

XVIII



XIX

that in this model impaired HGP suppression was a significant component of  
IGT.
 Chapter 5 focused on postprandial hepatic glucose metabolism after a 
glucose load in healthy humans. Direct and indirect pathway contributions to 
hepatic glycogen synthesis during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were 
assessed by means of  two isotopic tracers ([U-13C]glucose and [U-2H7]glucose) 
following ingestion of  peppermint oil and NMR analysis of  plasma glucose 
and menthol glucuronide enrichments. Exchanges of  both carbon and hydrogen 
moieties during the direct pathway metabolism of  glucose were further revealed 
and quantified. During an OGTT in healthy humans, half  of  the hepatic glycogen 
synthesis was derived from 3-carbon precursors (indirect pathway) rather than 
directly from the glucose load. Furthermore, during an OGTT, ~20% of  the 
direct pathway flux was involved in transaldolase exchange, hence the values 
derived from the [U-13C]glucose tracer resulted in underestimates of  the direct 
pathway contribution. 
 Sources of  hepatic triglycerides accumulation in healthy and HF diet-fed 
rats, for evaluation of  hepatic triglycerides content by using a novel 2H2O and 
2H NMR methodology combined with in vivo proton (1H) Magnetic Resonance 
Spectroscopy (MRS), were determined in Chapter 6. In healthy rats, hepatic 
triglyceride levels can be acutely raised or lowered by altering the dietary fat 
content and these changes can be effectively monitored by 1H MRS. During HF 
diet feeding, essentially all of  the hepatic triglycerides were derived from dietary 
lipid with very little contribution from hepatic de novo lipogenesis. 
 Finally, Chapter 7 presents the concluding remarks where all the results 
described in this Thesis were integrated and further discussed. 





RESUMO
 

 Nas últimas décadas, a incidência de resistência à insulina e de diabetes 
tipo 2 têm aumentado principalmente devido a alterações de estilos de vida e na 
dieta. A diabetes pós-transplante é igualmente um tópico de crescente interesse 
considerando os números elevados e aumento das taxas de sobrevivência actuais 
de transplantes de orgãos. O fígado é um orgão profundamente envolvido na 
regulação da homeostase corporal da glicose e lipídica. Como tal, alterações 
hepáticas do metabolismo da glicose e lipídico poderão ocupar um papel central 
no desenvolvimento de patologias como a resistência à insulina, a diabetes 
tipo 2 ou a diabetes pós-transplante. Nesta Tese procedeu-se à avaliação do 
metabolismo hepático da glicose e lipídico em modelos animais e em pacientes 
com resistência à insulina, diabetes tipo 2 ou diabetes pós-transplante, utilizando-
se marcadores de isótopos estáveis e análise por espectroscopia de Ressonância 
Magnética Nuclear (RMN). Adicionalmente, foram desenvolvidas novas 
metodologias para o estudo do metabolismo hepático da glicose em situações de 
jejum e em condições mais dinâmicas, e procedeu-se a uma análise integrativa do 
metabolismo hepático da glicose e lipídico.         
 No Capítulo 1, o metabolismo corporal da glicose e lípidos foi revisto e 
integrado focando as alterações do metabolismo hepático associadas à resistência 
à insulina e à diabetes. Os marcadores de isótopos estáveis e as técnicas de 
Ressonância Magnética assim como a sua aplicação à avaliação do metabolismo 
hepático foram introduzidos.    
 No Capítulo 2, as fontes endógenas de glicose durante o jejum foram 
avaliadas em ratos controlo e modelos animais de resistência à insulina induzida 
através de uma dieta rica em gordura. Para tal, utilizou-se [3,4-13C2]glicose 
e água deuterada (2H2O) em combinação com espectroscopia de RMN de 
carbono 13 (13C) e deutério (2H). A produção endógena de glicose resultante da 

XXI



gluconeogénese e da glicogenólise determinada nos animais alimentados com 
uma dieta rica em gordura foi essencialmente idêntica à dos controlos com uma 
dieta normal. Os fluxos normais de produção endógena de glicose encontrados 
nos animais sujeitos a uma dieta rica em gordura sugerem que as alterações 
dos fluxos hepáticos da glicose não estão envolvidas, pelo menos nos estádios 
iniciais, no desenvolvimento da resistência à insulina como consequência de uma 
dieta rica em gordura.   
 No Capítulo 3, as fontes hepáticas de glicose durante o jejum foram 
quantificadas em pacientes com transplante renal e terapia imunossupressora 
baseada em Ciclosporina A (CsA). Foi proposta uma nova análise Bayesiana dos 
sinais de RMN de 2H das posições 2 e 5 da monoacetona glicose derivada do 
glucuronado de paracetamol urinário, após ingestão de 2H2O e paracetamol, para 
a quantificação relativa das fontes gliconeogénicas e glicogenolíticas de produção 
hepática de glicose. Nos pacientes com transplante renal, a contribuição da 
gliconeogénese para a produção hepática de glicose é significativamente superior 
nos casos estabelecidos de diabetes pós-transplante. Esta alteração metabólica 
está principalmente relacionada com a crescente adiposidade e aumento do 
índice de massa corporal. Por outro lado, o tratamento com CsA per se provocou 
alterações modestas nas fontes hepáticas de glicose, não estando associado com  
a hiperglicémia ou hiperinsulinémia em jejum.  
 O destino de uma carga de glicose intra-peritoneal em ratos saudáveis foi 
estudado no Capítulo 4, utilizando a análise por espectroscopia de RMN de 13C 
e 2H após administração de [U-13C]glicose e 2H2O. A contribuição da produção 
hepática de glicose para a glicose total foi determinada a partir do enriquecimento 
em 2H da posição 2 da glicose plasmática em relação ao enriquecimento da água 
plasmática. Por outro lado, a contribuição da gliconeogénese foi determinada pela 
quantificação da razão entre os enriquecimentos em 2H da posição 5 do glicose 
plasmática e da água plasmática. As contribuições da carga intra-peritoneal de 
glicose e da glicose “reciclada” através do ciclo de Cori para a glicose total foram 

XXII



XXIII

estimadas a partir dos níveis de enriquecimento dos respectivos isotopómeros de 
[U-13C]glicose presentes no plasma em relação ao enriquecimento inicial da carga 
de glicose. As fontes de glicose após a prova de tolerância à glicose intra-peritoneal  
foram avaliadas em animais sob uma dieta rica em gordura e com tratamento 
baseado em CsA. Ambos os grupos de animais mostraram intolerância à glicose 
relativamente aos controlos. Com a  dieta rica em gordura, a produção hepática 
de glicose não foi alterada, tendo-se observado um padrão de secreção normal 
de insulina pelas células-b pancreáticas. Como tal, a hiperglicémia pós-prandial 
observada provavelmente reflecte uma ligeira resistência à insulina a nível dos 
orgãos periféricos em vez de produção hepática de glicose alterada. Por outro 
lado, nos animais tratados com CsA, a intolerância à glicose observada está 
associada com um aumento da contribuição da produção hepática de glicose.      
 O Capítulo 5 focou o metabolismo hepático pós-prandial de glicose 
após uma prova de tolerância à glicose oral (PTGO) em pessoas saudáveis. 
Foram avaliadas as contribuições relativas da via directa e indirecta de síntese 
de glicogénio durante a PTGO utilizando dois marcadores de isótopos 
estáveis ([U-13C]glicose e [U-2H7]glicose), após ingestão de mentol e análise por 
espectroscopia de RMN dos enriquecimentos em 13C e 2H da glicose plasmática 
e do glucuronado de mentol urinário. As trocas existentes dos meios de carbono 
e de hidrogénio envolvidos foram reveladas e quantificadas. Durante a PTGO 
em pessoas saudáveis, cerca de metade da síntese de glicogénio hepático derivou 
de precursores de 3 carbonos (via indirecta) e não directamente da glicose oral 
fornecida. Durante a PTGO, ~20% do fluxo da via directa esteve envolvido em 
trocas promovidas pela transaldolase, pelo que os valores derivados a partir do 
marcador de [U-13C]glicose resultam numa subestima das contribuições da via 
directa.     
 As fontes de triglicéridos hepáticos em ratos saudáveis e alimentados 
com uma dieta rica em gordura foram determinadas no Capítulo 6 utilizando 
uma nova metodologia baseada em 2H2O e análise por espectroscopia de RMN 
de 2H juntamente com espectroscopia de Ressonância Magnética  de protão (1H) 



in vivo para avaliação do conteúdo de triglicéridos no fígado. Em ratos saudáveis, 
os níveis de triglicéridos hepáticos podem ser rápidamente regulados alterando 
o conteúdo em gordura da dieta. Estas mudanças podem ser efectivamente 
monitorizadas usando espectroscopia de Ressonância Magnética  de 1H in vivo. 
Nos ratos com uma dieta rica em gordura, quase a totalidade dos triglicéridos 
hepáticos derivaram dos lípidos da dieta com uma contribuição residual da 
lipogénese de novo hepática.  
 Finalmente, o Capítulo 7 apresenta as conclusões gerais onde todos os 
resultados descritos nesta Tese foram discutidos e integrados.

1.1. Introduction 
 
 Diabetes mellitus is a widespread and growing public health problem 
affecting over 171 million people worldwide. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) predicts that by 2030 over 366 million people will be affected with 
diabetes. The growing worldwide prevalence of  diabetes is highly associated 
with the increasingly sedentary life-style, together with access to energy-rich 
diets in genetically susceptible individuals. Diabetes is directly responsible 
for considerable morbidity and mortality, accounting for 5.2% of  worldwide 
mortality in 2000 (Roglic et al. 2005). Moreover, the secondary complications of  
diabetes, including cardiovascular and microvascular dysfunction place a large 
burden on health care (i.e., heart failure, stroke, blindness and end-stage renal 
disease). Overall, treatment of  diabetes and its secondary complications are 
estimated to consume up to 15% of  the world’s healthcare budget, hence its 
economic impact is considerable. 
 Diabetes is characterized by several metabolic disruptions that ultimately 
lead to hyperglycemia that can result either from impaired insulin secretion, type 
1 diabetes (T1D) and/or abnormal insulin resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes (T2D) 
(Table 1.1). Insulin resistance can be defined as a state of  reduced responsiveness 
of  insulin-sensitive tissues to normal circulating levels of  insulin. T2D accounts 
for the vast majority (85-95%) of  diabetes worldwide incidence. In the wake of  
increased solid organ transplantation and improved survival rates, posttransplant 
diabetes mellitus (PTDM) and its adverse effects on organ rejection and quality 
of  life is also a recent and rapidly growing concern. Of  special interest is the 
possible role of  cyclosporine A (CsA) and other immunosuppressive agents in 
the pathogenesis of  PTDM. To the extent that PTDM is associated with IR 
and glucose intolerance, its pathophysiology resembles that of  T2D but the 
underlying mechanisms, which like T2D may include disruptions of  whole body 
glucose and lipid metabolism, remain unclear.

 The liver is an insulin sensitive organ that is highly involved in glucose 
and lipid biosynthesis. The effects of  insulin in the liver are to appropriately 
alter metabolic fluxes of  glucose and lipids to maintain whole body homeostasis. 
Mechanisms of  hepatic metabolism regulation by insulin include alteration of  
metabolic gene expression and modulation of  specific enzyme activities.
 The development of  IR and diabetes is closely linked with disruption 
of  hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. Classical approaches of  hepatic 
metabolism assessment include rather invasive techniques such as liver biopsy 
or hepatic venous catheterization protocols. Currently, the development of  
techniques involving stable isotopes and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) 
combined with the application of  safe and noninvasive methods, such as Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) have made it possible to 
easily assess hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in vivo in both animals and 
humans.

1.2. Integration of  whole body glucose metabolism 

 Whole body glucose homeostasis is maintained over the daily feeding/
fasting cycle through tight coordination between glucose appearance and disposal. 
Following carbohydrate ingestion, glucose is absorbed from the intestine into the 
hepatic portal vein. It then enters the liver, where a portion (~20%) is directly 
removed for storage as glycogen (Paquot et al. 2000, Petersen et al. 2001). The 
remaining glucose then enters the general circulation where it is consumed by 
peripheral tissues, such as skeletal muscle (Katz et al. 1983). The increased levels 
of  plasma glucose promote pancreatic b-cells to secrete insulin which induces 
peripheral and splanchnic glucose uptake while at the same time, promoting 
hepatic glycogen synthesis and suppressing glucose production from the liver 
(Rizza et al. 1981) (Figure 1.1).

? Chapter 1

 In postabsorptive conditions, glucose appearance is entirely accounted 
for by endogenous glucose production (EGP) once digestive absorption has 
ceased. The ultimate step of  glucose production from endogenous precursors 
involves the hydrolysis of  glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to glucose by glucose-
6-phosphatase (G6Pase). Thus, only G6Pase expressing organs such as the 
liver and kidney can account for EGP (Van Schaftingen et al. 2002). While low 
levels of  G6Pase activity have been found on other tissues such as pancreatic 
b-cells, intestine and skeletal muscle, these tissues do not represent significant 
sources of  EGP (Ockerman et al. 1965, Khan et al. 1995, Gamberucci et al. 
1996, Chatelain et al. 1998, Rajas et al. 1999, Croset et al. 2001). Under extreme 
conditions of  acidosis or prolonged starvation, renal glucose production can 
contribute significantly to glucose production (Ekberg et. al 1999, Moller et al. 
2001). However, under normal fasting conditions (i.e., overnight), hepatic glucose 
production (HGP) is the dominant source. HGP is regulated by insulin hence 
when insulin levels are low, as in the fasted state, HGP rates increase. Also, under 
these circumstances, glucagon is released from pancreatic a-cells, promoting 
the conversion of  glycogen to glucose by the liver and further boosting HGP 
activity.
 While liver, pancreas and skeletal muscle have long been considered to 
be the key tissues involved in glucose homeostasis, the role of  other tissues (i.e., 
kidney, adipose tissue, gut and brain) is now being recognized. For example, 
after a meal, substrates stimulate the release of  satiety signals, hormones and 
paracrine factors from the gut (i.e., ghrelin, amylin, peptide YY, apoliprotein A-1 
and incretins (Holst and Gromada 2004)) and from the adipose tissue (leptin) 
(Buchanan et al. 1998). These signals then enter the circulation where they can 
directly stimulate the central nervous system (CNS) and inform about whole 
body energy availability. Subsequently, the CNS initiates and coordinates changes 
in energy and glucose homeostasis into peripheral tissues through changes in 
insulin secretion, HGP rates and glucose skeletal muscle uptake (Sandoval et al. 
2008).

1.2.1.Hepatic glucose intermediary metabolism and endogenous glucose 
         production

 Hepatic glucose metabolism plays an important role in whole body 
glucose homeostasis by maintaining a balance between the uptake and storage 
of  glucose and the release of  glucose in response to the nutritional status. 
 After a meal, glucose is taken up by the liver predominantly by the 
non-insulin sensitive glucose transporter (GLUT2) (Leturque et al. 2005). The 
increase in hepatic portal vein glucose concentration activates glucokinase, 
through its rapid mobilization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and glucose is 
phosphorylated to G6P. G6P can be isomerized to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) by 
phosphoglucose isomerase and further metabolized by glycolysis. Alternatively it 
can be stored as glycogen. Elevated G6P concentrations act synergistically with 
glucose and promote the inactivation of  glycogen phosphorylase and activation 
of  glycogen synthase (Agius 2008). Furthermore, hyperinsulinemia increases 
glycogen synthesis by counteracting the action of  glycogenolytic hormones as 
glucagon and by activating glycogen synthase (Cohen et al. 1978). 
 Hepatic glycogen can be synthesized directly from G6P or through 
an indirect pathway where G6P is first metabolized to 3-carbon precursors 
before being deposited into glycogen (Hems et al. 1972, Newgard et al. 1983, 
Newgard et al. 1984, Kurland  et al. 1989). Glycogen can also be synthesized from 
gluconeogenic precursors (i.e., lactate, gluconeogenic amino acids, glycerol) and 
these contribute to the indirect pathway flux. In vivo studies demonstrate that 
fluxes through direct and indirect pathways of  glycogen synthesis are regulated 
by substrate and hormonal concentrations (Lang et al. 1986, Shulman  et al. 1991). 
In healthy subjects, indirect pathway was found to contribute substantially (30-
50%) to hepatic glycogen synthesis after a breakfast meal following an overnight 
fast (Taylor et al. 1996, Jones et al. 2006). 
 
 



? Chapter 1

 In postabsorptive conditions, when plasma glucose and insulin levels 
fall, the liver becomes a net producer of  glucose through the conversion of  
G6P to glucose by G6Pase. Under these conditions, hepatic glycolytic fluxes 
drop due to decreased levels of  the key glycolytic regulator fructose-2,6-
biphosphatase and gluconeogenesis is promoted. Gluconeogenesis represents 
the generation of  glucose from non-carbohydrate substrates (i.e., pyruvate, 
lactate, gluconeogenic amino acids and glycerol) and includes anaplerotic fluxes 
from the tricarboxylic acids (TCA) cycle. Gluconeogenesis is directly modified 
by insulin through inhibited expression of  key gluconeogenic enzymes, namely 
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 
(F1,6P

2
ase) and G6Pase (Barthel et al. 2003). In addition, insulin may inhibit 

gluconeogenesis by indirect mechanisms, as insulin-induced inhibition of  
adipose tissue lipolysis that reduces both free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol 
availability for gluconeogenesis. Insulin also inhibits muscle proteolysis, resulting 
in a decreased availability of  gluconeogenic amino acids (Umpleby et al. 1996).
 Moreover, the increase in the circulating glucagon to insulin ratio, 
characteristic of  fasting periods, activates glycogen phosphorylase and the 
concomitant mobilization of  hepatic glycogen stores to generate glucose-1-
phosphate (G1P), which is then converted to G6P and glucose (Figure 1.2). The 
relative contribution of  gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis to HGP depend on 
physiological conditions, hormonal factors and substrate availability. In healthy 
overnight fasted humans, gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis contribute 
equally to HGP. As the fasting period increases, hepatic glycogen stores become 
depleted and the fraction of  HGP derived from gluconeogenesis is increased 
(Landau et al. 1996). At 60 hours of  fasting, gluconeogenesis accounts for more 
than 90% of  HGP (Rothman et al. 1991).

1.3. Integration of  whole body lipid metabolism 

 Triglycerides account for the majority of  dietary lipids. Ingested 
triglycerides are hydrolyzed in the gut and then absorbed in the small intestine 
where most of  the fatty acids are resynthesized into triglycerides. Afterwards, 
triglycerides are released to the bloodstream through the lymphatic system in 
the form of  chylomicron particles. Most of  the triglycerides are further removed 
from chylomicrons by hydrolysis in non-hepatic tissues, such as adipose tissue 
by means of  the insulin-stimulated lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (Sadur  et al. 1982) 
whereas a minor percentage of  triglycerides are taken up by skeletal muscle, by 
means of  a LPL insensitive to insulin. After a meal, the net effect of  insulin in 
adipose tissue is to enhance fatty acid storage as triglycerides with concomitant 
inhibition of  fatty acids mobilization and oxidation. These stored triglycerides 
serve as a principal source of  energy during fasting conditions.  
 In postabsorptive conditions, FFA are released from adipose tissue, 
through lipolysis of  triglycerides. Lipolysis depends almost entirely on hormone-
sensitive lipase (HSL) which is activated by a fall in insulin concentration and 
increase in glucagon levels (Meijssen et al. 2001). The rate of  adipose tissue 
lipolysis exceeds that of  fatty acid oxidation. Hence, a significant portion of  
fatty acids are reesterified into triglycerides within the adipose tissue, liver and 
skeletal muscle. Under normal circumstances, most FFA released from adipose 



	 	 	      Chapter 1 11

tissue are reesterified within the liver. Hepatic triglycerides can serve as local 
stores for hepatic needs or packaged in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) 
for export into the bloodstream (Figure 1.3). Triglycerides accumulate in the 
liver when their synthesis exceeds their export via VLDL particles (Sanyal et al. 
2005).

postabsorptive conditions (in red). LPL. lipoprotein lipase; HSL. hormone-sensitive lipase; 
FFA. free fatty acids; VLDL. very low density lipoproteins. 

 There has been much interest in the role of  fatty acids in whole body 
glucose homeostasis as they compete with glucose for substrates, as first 
described by Randle et al. (Randle et al. 1963). After a meal, elevated plasma 
glucose concentrations stimulate insulin secretion, which then suppresses FFA 
release from adipose tissue. This removes competition for substrate utilization 
in skeletal muscle and promotes whole body glucose disposal. Conversely, 
when plasma FFA concentration is high, usually as a result of  low glucose and

insulin concentrations, fatty acids become the major fuel for skeletal muscle 
and glucose is spared for utilization by brain and CNS. Thus, the regulation of  
lipolysis enables FFA availability as an energy fuel to be inversely related to that 
of  glucose.
  
1.3.1. Hepatic lipid intermediary metabolism

 The major sources of  hepatic fatty acids are: the uptake of  fatty acids 
released by lipolysis of  adipose tissue triglycerides, the uptake of  triglycerides in 
VLDL and chylomicrons remnants, and hepatic de novo lipogenesis from acetyl-
CoA. Long-term control of  hepatic de novo lipogenesis involves changes in 
enzymatic activity and contributes to nutritional adaptations (i.e., increasing the 
capacity for endogenous triglyceride synthesis in response to a high carbohydrate 
and low fat diet). Short-term control over the daily feeding and fasting cycles 
involves modulation of  enzyme activity by factors such as substrate supply and 
hormonal regulation. For example in the fed state, insulin promotes hepatic de 
novo lipogenesis by: 1) activation of  pyruvate dehydrogenase and acetyl-CoA 
carboxylase to form acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, respectively; 2) inactivation 
of  pyruvate carboxylase and lactate dehydrogenase; and 3) stimulation of  the 
fatty acid synthase (Wang et al. 1998, Sul et al. 2000), an enzymatic complex 
that catalyzes all reactions for the synthesis of  fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and 
malonyl-CoA. After a meal, excess fatty acids are reesterified to triglycerides 
within the liver.
 In postabsorptive conditions, the expression of  fatty acid synthase is 
decreased with concomitant reduction of  hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Under these 
conditions, hepatic fatty acids are mainly oxidized via b-oxidation to acetyl-CoA 
and the main function is energy production for liver many metabolic activities 
(i.e., gluconeogenesis). Fatty acids b-oxidation is regulated by malonyl-CoA 
levels that inhibit carnitine acyltranferase, responsible for the transport of  fatty 
acids to mitochondria (where fatty acid b-oxidation occurs) (Figure 1.4).

1.4. Disruptions in glucose and lipid metabolism 
  
1.4.1. Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes

 T2D is a heterogeneous and polygenic disorder resulting from the 
interaction of  genetic and environmental factors (Romao et al. 2008). Several 
studies revealed altered gene expression associated with T2D including a number 
of  genes that code for insulin signalling proteins. Apart from being a polygenic 
syndrome, T2D is also characterized by hyperglycemia and other metabolic 
perturbations secondary to IR and/or relative insulin deficiency. Hepatic and 
peripheral IR are key pathophysiological events in the onset of  these metabolic 
disorders and may precede the onset of  frank T2D by 10 to 20 years. 
 The majority of  insulin-dependent glucose disposal occurs in skeletal 
muscle where insulin increases glucose uptake by stimulating the translocation 
of  the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, GLUT4, to the cell membrane. At 
a molecular level, multiple defects in insulin signalling have been implied in 
peripheral IR, including diminished insulin receptor number and affinity, altered 
insulin receptor kinase activity, decreased phosphorylation of  intracellular 
substrates (i.e., IRS-1 and IRS-2) and abnormalities in glucose transporter 
translocation and activation (Saltiel and Khan 2001, Khan and Pessin 2002, 
Schinner et al. 2005). Thus, skeletal muscle IR is a consequence of  abnormal 
insulin transduction pathways which culminates in the reduced uptake of  glucose 
by GLUT4 and a substantial decrease in insulin stimulated muscle glycogen 
synthesis (Shulman et al. 1990, Cline et al. 1999, He et al. 2004). 



	 	 	      Chapter 1 1?

 In addition to impaired glucose clearance, there is also an excessive rate of  
fasting HGP in IR and T2D. Consoli et al. showed that about 90% of  the increase 
in HGP in T2D can be accounted for enhanced gluconeogenesis (Consoli et al. 
1989). Elevated gluconeogenesis in T2D can be attributed to several factors, 
such as increased circulating levels of  gluconeogenic precursors, increased FFA 
oxidation, enhanced sensitivity to glucagon and decreased sensitivity to insulin. 
After a meal in healthy subjects, ~20% of  total carbohydrate intake is stored as 
glycogen in the liver. Type 2 diabetics show decreased hepatic glycogen content 
(Magnusson et al. 1992). Defects in the process of  hepatic glycogen synthesis 
secondary to hepatic IR may reduce the capacity of  the liver to remove glucose 
from the circulation thus contributing to postprandial hyperglycemia. Moreover, 
inhibition of  postprandial HGP is deffective in T2D.   
 Early in the development of  IR, pancreatic b-cells secrete sufficient 
insulin to compensate for peripheral and splanchnic IR and normoglycemia is 
maintained (Saad et al. 1989). However, when pancreatic b-cells are unable to 
meet the increased demand for insulin secretion, hyperglycemia occurs (Szoke  
and Gerich 2005). In a vicious cycle, hyperglycemia per se (glucotoxicity) and the 
adverse effects of  elevated fatty acids (lipotoxicity) (Shimabukuro et al. 1998, 
Grill et al. 2000) may also contribute to functional abnormalities and failure of  
pancreatic b-cells.
 It is well known that disorders in fat storage and mobilization are 
associated with the pathophysiology of  IR and T2D, hence obesity and T2D are 
often closely associated (Lewis et al. 2002, McGarry 2002, Kelley et al. 2003). In 
type 2 diabetics, the ability of  insulin to suppress FFA release from adipose tissue 
by lipolysis is reduced (Coppack et al. 1994). The resultant excess circulating 
FFA will be reesterified to triglycerides in liver and skeletal muscle (Perseghin 
et al. 1999, Jacob et al. 1999, Virkamaki et al. 2001, Petersen and Shulman 2002, 
Machann et al. 2004). This ectopic accumulation of  triglycerides interferes with 
insulin regulation of  glucose metabolism (Miyazaki et al. 2002). For example, in 



1? Chapter 1

skeletal muscle, alterations in glucose transport activity are likely to result from 
the accumulation of  intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) since this promotes altered 
insulin receptor kinase activity. Increased hepatic triglyceride (HTG) content is 
also implicated in hepatic IR (Ryysy et al. 2000, Marchesini et al. 2001, Kelley et al. 
2003) since it is highly associated with excessive fasting and postprandial HGP 
rates (Boden et al. 2002). Mechanisms include the stimulation of  gluconeogenesis 
and impaired insulin-mediated activation of  glycogen synthase (Samuel et al. 
2004). 
 Apart from metabolic alterations in the liver, skeletal muscle, pancreas 
and adipose tissue, increased glucose reabsorption in the kidney, decreased gut 
incretin effects (Knop et al. 2007) and neurotransmitter dysfunction (Schwartz et 
al. 2005) also contribute to hyperglycemia in T2D (Figure 1.5). More recently, the 
link between obesity and inflammation has raised the question of  whether obesity-
induced inflammation plays a role in the development of  IR and T2D (Shoelson 
et al. 2006, Hotamisligil 2006). The concept that T2D has an immunological 
component provides the basis for formulating hypotheses that this syndrome 
and related factors as IR may be promoted in situations of  immunodeficiency, 
as for instance patients on immunosuppressant therapy.  

1.4.2. Posttransplant diabetes mellitus     
 PTDM is defined as the development of  sustained hyperglycemia 
following an otherwise successful transplant procedure in patients without prior 
history of  glucose intolerance or diabetes. The reported incidence of  PTDM in 
literature is unclear, mainly due to a lack of  consensus regarding the definition 
of  the condition. Incidences as high as 25% have been reported (Reisæter and 
Hartmann 2001). 



	 	 	      Chapter 1 1?

Figure 1.5. Whole body metabolic alterations leading to hyperglycemia in type 2 
diabetes. 

 PTDM is generally accepted to be associated with a greater risk for 
morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease and a greater incidence of  
graft failure (Weir and Fink 1999, John et al. 2002, Salvadori et al. 2003, Markell 
2004). Several PTDM risk factors have been identified including age, ethnicity, 
obesity, metabolic syndrome, hepatitis C infection and immunosuppressant 
regime (Jindal 1994, Weir and Fink 1999, Reisæter and Hartmann 2001, Salvadori 
2003, Markell 2004, Marchetti 2004, Mora 2005). Throughout this Thesis, special 
attention will be given to one of  the most widely used immunosuppressant drugs, 
the calcineurin inhibitor CsA, and particularly its effect on whole body glucose 
and lipid metabolism.

 1.4.2.1. Calcineurin inhibitors

 Under normal circunstances, calcineurin induces the transcription of  
interleukines which are citokines deeply involved in the immunological system 
activities. Calcineurin inhibitors bind to proteins called immunophilins forming 
complexes which bind to calcineurin promoting its inhibition. Thus, calcineurin 
inhibitors are associated with defective immune responses (Schreiber and 
Crabtree 1992, Kapturczak et al. 2004). The introduction of  the calcineurin 
inhibitors, such as CsA and tacrolimus (Fk510), in immunosuppressive regimens 
was associated with a lower risk for PTDM. Nevertheless, CsA and Fk510 
administration was shown to promote glucose intolerance, hence these drugs may 
also be diabetogenic, albeit to a lesser extent than for instance glucocorticoids 
(GCs). 
 In spite of  some studies associating CsA with peripheral IR (Yale et al. 
1988, Wahlstrom et al. 1990, Wahlstrom et al. 1992), the diabetogenic nature of  CsA 
results mainly from it’s disruption of  pancreatic b-cell function (Doyle and Egan 
2003), whether by affecting insulin synthesis or impairing the insulin secretory 
response of  islet cells (Nielsen et al. 1986, Drachenberg et al. 1999, Hjelmesaeth 
et al. 2007). PTDM in patients on calcineurin inhibitors treatment indicate that 
calcineurin and its substrate (Nuclear Factor of  Activated T-cells) may be required 
for b-cell function (Heit 2007). Furthermore, CsA administration is associated 
with dyslipidemia by increasing hepatic lipase activity and decreasing adipose 
tissue LPL hydrolysis thus resulting in impaired VLDL clearance (Subramanian 
et al. 2007). These disorders in fat storage and mobilization may in turn promote 
IR and contribute to PTDM.

1.5.  Clinical  assessment  of   hepatic  metabolic  disorders  in  insulin 
         resistance and diabetes

 In the development of  T2D and PTDM, IR is predominant and underlies 
the failure in the stimulation of  glucose uptake by skeletal muscle, and impaired 
control of  HGP. Therefore, as a result of  IR, fasting and/or postprandial 
hyperglycemia may prevail. Table 1.2 summarizes the current diabetes diagnostic 
criteria by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (American Diabetes 
Association 2008). Typically, tests for assessment of  IR can be separated into 
three different types: steady-state, fasting and dynamic measurement tests. 

TABLE 1.2: Criteria diagnosis of  diabetes mellitus by the American Diabetes Association 
(ADA) (American Diabetes Association 2008).

1.5.1. Steady-state measurement tests 
 Steady-state refers to the dynamic equilibrium of  plasma glucose levels 
which implies that EGP and/or exogenously administered glucose equals the 
whole body glucose utilization rate. The gold standard method for quantifying 
IR is the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp that was first introduced by Andres 
et al. (Andres et al. 1966) and later developed by DeFronzo et al. (DeFronzo 
et al. 1979). In the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique, exogenous 
insulin is infused at constant levels to create hyperinsulinemia while the plasma 
glucose concentrations are kept at the euglycemic level using a variable glucose 
infusion. Thus, in these steady-state conditions, the rate of  glucose infusion

2)

?0 Chapter 1

is proportional to insulin sensitivity and inversely related to IR. Also, EGP is 
maximally suppressed such that the rate of  glucose infusion approaches that of  
glucose disposal.
 Under steady-state conditions, the insulin suppression test (IST), exploits 
the effect of  insulin on glucose disposal after endogenous insulin is suppressed 
(i.e., by means of  propranolol plus epinephrine or by infusing somatostatin). 
The increase in plasma glucose levels following suppression of  insulin provides 
a measurement of  insulin sensitivity.

1.5.2. Fasting measurement tests 
 Steady-state tests are quite laborious and time consuming, hence their 
routine implementation is not possible in clinical centers. Therefore, indicators 
of  IR based on a basal measurement of  fasting plasma glucose and insulin 
levels from a single blood sample have been developed. During fasting, glucose 
levels are a balance between EGP and whole body glucose disposal and both 
processes are regulated by insulin. Thus, elevated fasting plasma insulin and/or 
glucose are indicative of  IR. Several models based on fasting insulin and glucose 
measurements have been developed, and validated against the hyperinsulinemic 
euglycemic clamp. For example, the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA), 
calculated from fasting plasma insulin and glucose, was first described by 
Matthews et al. (Matthews et al. 1985) and is indicative of  IR. More recently, a 
quantitative insulin check index (QUICKI) was developed and is derived using 
the inverse of  the sum of  the logarithms of  fasting plasma insulin and glucose 
(Katz et al. 2000). These indices are suitable for epidemiological studies where 
large study populations need to be sampled. 

1.5.3. Dynamic measurement tests

 To evaluate IR in dynamic conditions it is necessary to perturb the 
insulin/glucose system by providing glucose or insulin. During the intravenous 



	 	 	      Chapter 1 ?1

glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), metabolism is perturbed by infusing exogenous 
glucose and glucose clearance from plasma is assessed. The glucose clearance 
rates are proportional to peripheral IR. Alternatively, exogenous glucose can 
be provided by means of  an oral load, such as in an oral glucose tolerance test 
(OGTT), or included in a more physiological mixed meal. Several models have 
been proposed for analytical interpretation of  the OGTT empirical results, such 
as the model-based insulin sensitivity (OGIS) (Mari et al. 2001) and the clamp 
like index (CLIX) (Anderwald et al. 2007). Finally, glucose homeostasis can be 
perturbed by providing exogenous insulin and evaluating changes in plasma 
glucose levels, the insulin tolerance test (ITT). 
 The tests described in here, in spite of  useful for assessment of  peripheral 
insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal do not provide insights into the sources 
of  plasma glucose and therefore hepatic glucose metabolism. For this purpose, 
metabolic tracers need to be incorporated into these assays.

1.6. Isotopic tracers in metabolic studies    

 Until recently, assessment of  hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism was 
based on rather invasive studies. These include needle liver biopsies, which 
allow a direct quantification of  hepatic metabolite concentrations (Beringer and 
Thaler 1964, Nilsson 1973, Nilsson and Hultman 1973, Nilsson and Hultman 
1974), and catheterization protocols, which measure net uptake and release of  
substrates by the liver (Madison 1969, Wahren et al. 1972). The introduction of  
metabolic tracers was of  fundamental importance for establishing the metabolic 
intermediates in the pathways of  hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism as well as  
for determining pathway fluxes. 
 Following the development of  Mass Spectrometry (MS) and the 
purification of  hydrogen and other isotopes, the deuterium (2H) stable isotope 



?? Chapter 1

was one of  the first tracers used for in vivo metabolic studies (Schoenheimer et 
al. 1935). With the advent of  simple instruments for quantifying radioactivity 
via scintillation counting and the availability of  a wide range of  carbon 14 
(14C) and tritrium (3H) tracers, most of  the pioneering studies in mammalian 
intermediary metabolism used radioactive tracers. The development of  
routine radioactivity measurements coincided with the development of  paper 
and column chromatography techniques for separating complex metabolite 
mixtures. A resurgence in the use of  stable isotopes followed the coupling 
of  chromatographic separation with MS analysis in the form of  the Gas 
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) instrument and the development 
of  improved sensitivity for the detection of  carbon 13 (13C), 2H and nitrogen 
15 (15N) nuclei by NMR. The replacement of  radioactive with stable isotopes is 
required for most studies involving humans and is mandatory for all studies in 
children or women of  child-bearing potential.
 Considering the composition of  biological substrates, 13C and 2H 
are widely used stable isotopes for in vivo studies. 13C has natural background 
abundance of  1.11% while that of  2H is 0.015%. Metabolic substrates for tracer 
studies are enriched to a high level (99%) with 13C, 2H or both. Hence, for a singly-
labeled substrate, the highest attainable enrichment relative to the background 
level for that position is ~90-fold for 13C and ~6,000-fold for 2H. Since metabolic 
tracers may be diluted by 2-3 orders of  magnitude by endogenous metabolites, 
the background abundance may contribute significantly to the detected isotope 
levels. For 13C in particular, multi-labeled tracer substrates are preferred for 
metabolic studies as the enrichment of  n positions in a given molecule results in 
a substantially reduction of  background 13C-signals of  (0.011)n.  



	 	 	      Chapter 1 ??

1.7. Tracing glucose metabolism with stable isotopes         
      
 In postabsorptive conditions, liver is a net producer of  glucose through 
gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. EGP fluxes can be evaluated by the 
constant infusion-isotope dilution technique. Briefly, after a constant infusion 
of  a known concentration solution of  a 13C labeled glucose tracer, the infused 
labeled glucose will be diluted as a result of  unlabeled glucose from EGP. Thus, 
the rate of  appearance (Ra) of  labeled glucose in plasma is proportional to EGP 
fluxes. However, glucose carbons are recycled during their metabolism in vivo thus 
resulting in a higher enrichment than would otherwise be expected leading to 
lower dilution and concomitant increased EGP estimates. To avoid these effects, 
non-recyclable tracers as [U-13C]glucose or hydrogen isotope tracers (i.e., [2-2H], 
[6,6-2H

2
], [2,3,6,6-2H

4
]glucose) are used where the carbon skeleton is broken 

or the hydrogens are removed during glucose recycling. Relative contributions 
of  gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis sources to glucose production can be 
estimated by using 13C labeled gluconeogenic precursors (i.e., alanine, lactate 
or pyruvate) and measurement of  plasma precursor and glucose enrichment at 
isotopic equilibrium. 
 However, the use of  labeled glucose and 13C labeled gluconeogenic 
precursors present some drawbacks such as: 1) difficulties in determining true 
precursor enrichments since plasma and liver enrichments of  the tracer may differ; 
and 2) the zonation of  hepatic metabolism could imply that the incorporation 
of  the tracer into glucose is not representative of  all hepatic substrates. 
  In the last decade, deuterated water (2H

2
O), has been widely used for 

evaluation of  fasting glucose production sources. 2H
2
O is considered a safe 

and relative non-expensive tracer that can be used in humans as long as body 
water 2H-enrichment level is limited to 0.3-0.5%. The main advantage of  2H

2
O 

is the fact that rapidly equilibrates with total body water implying that precursor 
enrichment can be determined precisely from plasma or urine enrichments. 



?? Chapter 1

Moreover, 2H
2
O is not affected by zonation of  hepatic metabolism as it rapidly 

distributes through all tissues. After ingestion of  2H
2
O, plasma glucose becomes 

enriched with 2H at predictable positions depending upon the metabolic pathway 
that resulted in the formation of  the glucose molecule. The quantification of  the 
different plasma glucose 2H positional enrichments can provide information on 
the gluconeogenic and glycogenolysis contributions to EGP (Landau et al. 1995, 
Landau et al. 1996). 
 After a meal, glucose is taken up by the liver, used for glycogen 
synthesis and EGP is inhibited. Consequently, the evaluation of  hepatic glucose 
metabolism using stable isotopes in postprandial conditions is more complex. 
In postprandial conditions, when there is absorption of  a meal or a glucose 
load, simultaneously with the intravenous (i.v.) infusion of  a tracer, the newly 
absorbed glucose enters the portal vein and a fraction is removed by the liver, 
prior to entering peripheral circulation. Clearly, glucose meal and infusion tracers 
are not entering at equivalent points and the use of  a second tracer is usually 
necessary, the dual-tracer method (Radziuk et al. 1978, Radziuk et al. 1987). 
Whereas the first tracer is infused intravenously, the second tracer is added to 
the glucose as part of  the meal in order to calculate the systemic appearance rate 
of  both ingested tracer and total glucose. More recently, a triple-tracer technique 
was suggested for estimation of  postprandial appearance of  total and ingested 
glucose, and the suppression of  EGP. The first tracer is infused at a constant 
rate during the basal period and the second tracer is infused during the basal and 
in the postprandial period, being its infusion rate altered in the later to simulate 
the decline in postprandial EGP; finally, the third tracer is added to the meal 
(Basu et al. 2003). To date, dual- and triple-tracer methodologies, although very 
informative, are quite laborious and require complicated mathematical models 
for correct data extrapolation. Thus, in order to fully understand postprandial 
hepatic glucose metabolism, there is an urge for simpler protocols. 
 Hepatic glucose metabolism assessment using stable isotopes is based 



	 	 	      Chapter 1 ??

on the assessment of  plasma glucose, rather than by direct analysis of  hepatic 
glucose metabolites. To the extent that other organs (i.e., kidney) may contribute 
to plasma glucose appearance, the analysis of  plasma glucose enrichment may 
not represent hepatic metabolism. To address this, xenobiotic agents can be used 
for probing hepatic glucose metabolism. Xenobiotics are substances foreign to 
the body that are conjugated to specific glucose metabolic intermediates in the 
liver by several processes (i.e., glucuronidation, glutamination, ribosylation and 
others). For example, acetominophen and peppermint oil bind directly to hepatic 
uridine diphosphate-glucose (UDP-glucose) forming glucuronide that is excreted 
as urinary acetaminophen and menthol glucuronide, respectively (Landau et al. 
1991, Jones et al. 2001, Burgess et al. 2003, Ribeiro et al. 2005, Mendes et al. 
2006). The analysis of  the urinary conjugated xenobiotics provides a means of  
noninvasively assess hepatic glucose metabolism. In addition, by using these 
biopsy agents, hepatic glycogen metabolism can be further assessed (i.e., direct 
and indirect pathway relative contributions to hepatic glycogen synthesis after a 
glucose load (Petersen et al. 2001, Jones et al. 2006)). 
 However, xenobiotic agents are not appropriate for liver failure patients 
and may reflect hepatic zonation as the xenobiotic agent may only be sampling 
one hepatic region. For example, hepatic glutamine is sampled by phenylacetate 
or phenylbutyrate as urinary phenyalcetylglutamine (PAGN) (Magnusson et al. 
1991, Cline et al. 1994, Jones et al. 1998, Jones et al. 2001) only in the perivenous 
region of  the liver. Thus, the enrichment patterns of  glutamine may reflect that 
region and not the whole hepatic metabolism.  

1.8. Tracing lipid metabolism with stable isotopes

 During fasting, adipose tissue triglycerides are hydrolized to fatty acids 
that are released into the bloodstream. The fatty acids rate of  appearance into 



?? Chapter 1

the bloodstream can be measured by the constant infusion-isotope dilution 
technique. Following infusion of  labeled fatty acids (i.e., [U-13C]palmitate or [U-
13C]oleate), the Ra of  endogenous unlabeled fatty acids into the bloodstream 
can be determined by calculating the dilution of  the infused fatty acid tracer. 
However, due to the reesterification of  fatty acids within the adipose tissue, the 
rate of  appearance of  fatty acids does not always reflect lipolytic rates. Under 
fasting conditions, plasma glycerol is all derived from lipolysis and is utilized 
exclusively by the liver as other tissues lack glycerol kinase. Thus, the Ra of  
labeled glycerol determined after a primed constant infusion of  [U-13C]glycerol 
or [U-2H]glycerol gives a direct measurement of  adipose tissue lipolysis rates.  
 Excess fatty acids in the bloodstream can be uptaken by the liver, 
reesterified to triglycerides, and then released from the liver as VLDL 
triglycerides. Whole body triglyceride turnover is usually assessed by infusing 
a labeled fatty acid (i.e. [U-13C]palmitate, [U-13C]oleate) or glycerol and the 
appearance of  labeled fatty acids in VLDL triglycerides is used to calculate the 
rate of  triglycerides synthesis (Wolfe  et al. 1973). Another approach is to pre-
label the VLDL triglycerides with labeled glycerol or fatty acids. Afterwards, the 
VLDL are harvested by plasmapheresis and again infused into the subject for 
measurement of  fractional VLDL turnover rates (Wolfe et al. 1985, Sidossis et al. 
2004). 
 The fraction of  hepatic fatty acids derived from acetyl-CoA by de novo 
lipogenesis can be assessed by using [1-13C]acetate combined with the acetylated-
xenobiotic probe technique, sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and analysis of  the 
secreted VLDL. The SMX conjugates to hepatic acetyl-CoA and is later excreted 
in urine allowing the possibility to noninvasively assess hepatic acetyl-CoA 13C-
enrichment (Hellerstein et al. 1991). Blood VLDL triglycerides are then further 
analyzed and the 13C-enrichment in fatty acids from triglycerides determined. 
The ratio of  enrichments in fatty acids from VLDL triglycerides and acetyl-CoA 
reflects hepatic fatty acids de novo lipogenesis turnover rates.



	 	 	      Chapter 1 ??

 2H
2
O measurements have been applied with success to the study of  lipid 

metabolism. For example, following 2H
2
O ingestion, the Ra of  deuterium in 

whole body fatty acids is proportional to their synthetic rate (Schoenheimer  et 
al. 1935, Lee et al. 2000, Bassilian et al. 2002). 
 2H and 13C-enrichments in lipid molecules are typically quantified by 
GC-MS, a technique where ions are sorted out by their mass to charge (m/z) 
ratio. Molecules that incorporate heavy isotopes, for example 13C or 2H, will have 
a higher m/z ratio that can be resolved by GC-MS. Moreover, mass isotopomer 
distribution analysis (MIDA) can be used for enrichment quantification of  
polymers synthesized from repeating monomeric units (i.e., fatty acids from 
acetyl-CoA units or triglycerides from fatty acids). MIDA is a mass spectrometric 
technique based on combinatorial probabilities. The theoretical advantage of  
MIDA is that the precursor enrichment can be inferred from that of  the product 
(Hellerstein and Neese 1999). Hence, there is no need to measure precursor 
acetyl-CoA enrichments when measuring hepatic de novo lipogenesis rates. 

1.9. Stable isotopes analysis by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)           

 Because of  the 13C and 2H nuclear spin properties, these isotopes can be 
monitored and detected using GC-MS and NMR spectroscopy for quantification 
of  isotopic enrichment. GC-MS, is usually chosen because is more sensitive than 
NMR and due to its widespread application as a result of  the relatively low 
instrumentation cost. However, if  multiple stable isotopes or labeling patterns are 
used to probe additional metabolic pathways, NMR has a significant advantage, 
provided that its poor sensitivity is overcome by larger samples (10-100 mmol). In 
humans, 5 mL of  blood and a urine sample easily fulfil this requirement for most 
of  glucose and lipid metabolites. NMR is a non-destructive technique, ideally 
for repeated measurements. NMR principles are summarized schematically in 

Figure 1.6.

Figure 1.6. Principles of  NMR Spectroscopy. NMR is a physical phenomenon based upon 
the quantum mechanical magnetic properties of  certain atoms’ nucleus (spin?0) when placed 
in a strong static magnetic field (B0) generated by a NMR spectrometer. A. The constant force 
applied, B0, to the nucleus magnetic momentum induces an alignment. If  the spin of  the nucelus 
=1/2, parallel and anti-parallel alignment corresponds to the two energy levels allowed for each 
particular nucleus in presence of  a magnetic field. B. Stimulation of  the nuclei by an additional 
orthognal oscillating radio frequency (RF) magnetic field (B

) at the nuclei Larmor frequency 

(wL= g × B0, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio) transiently swings these nuclei out of  alignment 
producing a magnetization vector, M. C. When the RF pulse is turned off, the return to the 
low energy state (spin-lattice T

relaxation) is associated with emission of  non-radiative energy 

in the form of  radiowaves that are detected by a receiver coil, the free induction decay (FID). 
Moreover, the nuclei can also fall out of  alignment with each other (spin-spin T

 relaxation). The 

length of  T

 is closely related to molecular motion. The mathematical operation Fourier 

transformed (FT) of  the FID originates the corresponding spectrum. Importantly, nuclei in 
a molecule resonate at a given but unique frequency, depending on the molecular structure. 
This is known as chemical shift and occurs because nuclei in different chemical environments 
experience slightly different magnetic field strengths resultant from the shielding offered by the 
nearby electrons.

1.?.1. 1?C NMR

 13C has a favourable nuclear spin (I=1/2) to NMR spectroscopy. 
Additionally, 13C NMR displays a wide chemical shift range (~200 parts per 
million (ppm)), allowing a good resolution of  the 13C resonances. Moreover, 
peak signals in the 13C NMR spectra display narrow lineshapes, due to slow 
T

1
 relaxation, allowing a better separation of  the distinct peak signals with 

appropriate correction for T
1
 and Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE). A signal 

increase in the 13C NMR spectrum corresponds to an increase in the 13C-
enrichment and therefore can be interpreted as an incorporation of  label into 
the carbon position under observation. These 13C-enrichments are referred to as 
positional enrichments and are easily quantified by 13C NMR spectroscopy. 
 During metabolism, an isotopic tracer is submitted to pathway-
specific carbon rearrangements and, upon labeling with 13C, a specific range 
of  isotopomers is produced. For a molecule with n carbons a maximum of  
2n different isotopomers exist. Multi-labeled isotopes are usually preferred for 
metabolic studies as the simultaneously enrichment of  two covalently bound 
carbon positions in the same molecule not only increases the signal intensity 
for the two carbons positions but leads to homonuclear 13C-13C spin coupling, 
J-coupling, resulting in new signals called multiplets (Figure 1.7). The appearance 
of  multiplets permits the resolution of  background 13C from 13C tracer 
enrichments.

1.?.?. ?H NMR

 2H is a nucleus with a quadrupolar moment and a spin of  1, resulting 
in broad signals in the 2H NMR spectrum except for small molecules where 2H 
signals are relatively narrow. Moreover, 2H signals have low frequency dispersion 
(low gyromagnetic ratio- g/2p =1/6.52 that of  proton (1H)). This requires high 
magnetic fields and/or derivatization of  molecules to forms where the signals 
are better resolved (i.e., glucose to monoacetone glucose (MAG)). 



?0 Chapter 1

 At last, as the natural abundance of  deuterium is much lower than of  13C 
it can usually be neglected. Following the administration of  a deuterated tracer, 
different positional 2H-enrichments in a molecule of  interest can be associated 
with different metabolic pathway fluxes, similar to what is observed with 13C 
isotopomers. 2H NMR spectroscopy allows the quantification of  the different 
2H positional enrichments. 

Figure 1.7. J-coupling arises from the interaction of  different spin states through the 
chemical bonds of  a molecule and results in the splitting of  NMR signals. Coupling 
between n equivalent nuclei splits the signal into (n + 1) multiplets with intensity ratios following 
Pascal’s triangle. Coupling between chemically equivalent nuclei (with equal chemical shift) has 
no effect in the NMR spectra and coupling between nuclei that are distant are usually too small 
to cause observable splittings. Long-range couplings over more than three bonds can often be 
observed in cyclic and aromatic compounds, leading to more complex splitting patterns. For 
example, in the monoacetone glucose (MAG) molecule, spin coupling between positions 1 and 2 
is detected in the form of  line splitting of  the resonances of  carbon 1 position into doublets and 
is characterized by the line separation within the doublets, J1,2. When MAG is labeled in all the 
carbon positions, the resonance in carbon 1 will be split into a doublet due to the spin coupling 
between positions 1 and 2. Further splitting will occur due to coupling with carbon 5 of  MAG, 
resulting in a superposition of  both couplings, namely a doublet of  doublets (Perdigoto et al. 
2003).

1.?.?. 1H NMR

 The proton (1H) nucleus (spin=1/2) is the second most sensitive nucleus 
for NMR, in terms of  intrinsic NMR sensitivity (high gyromagnetic ratio) and 
has high natural abundance (&gt;99.9%). Since nearly all metabolites contain 
protons, 1H NMR is a powerful technique to observe, identify and quantify a 
large number of  biologically important metabolites. Due to 1H high sensitivity, 
it’s a suitable nucleus for in vivo studies by MRI and 1H MRS. 

1.10. In vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy (MRI/MRS)    

 There are many tools available to assess the anatomy, dynamic and 
metabolism in vivo. Whereas X-ray and Computer-assisted Tomography (CT) can 
provide high-resolution structural images, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) 
and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) present relatively 
low-resolution functional images. MRI is a relatively safe, as no ionizing radiation 
is used, and suitable technique for the noninvasive investigation of  anatomy 
and morphology. Moreover, due to excellent chemical specificity as expressed 
in the chemical shift, MRS can be applied to the monitorization of  particular 
intracellular metabolite concentrations and kinetics. MRI and MRS techniques 
are based on the principles of  NMR and spatial localization of  the MRI signal 
is achieved by using magnetic field gradients that are used to create position-
dependent magnetic fields. The principal nuclei studied are 13C and phosphorus 
(31P) (for MRS) and especially 1H (for MRI and 1H MRS). MRI exploits the fact 
that proton concentration varies in the different types of  body tissues. Also, 
different structures present distinct T

1
 and T

2
 values. Thus, different structures 

are revealed as these parameters can influence the intensity of  the proton signal 
in a predictable manner with certain pulsing/acquisition conditions.

1.10.1. Assessment of  hepatic glucose metabolism by in vivo 1?C MRS 
 Hepatic glucose metabolism is altered in diabetic states and assessment 
of  hepatic glucose metabolism is therefore crucial. The 1.11% natural abundance 
of  the 13C nucleus allows observation of  metabolites that are present in relatively 
high concentrations, such as glycogen. In vivo 13C MRS can be used for assessment 
of  hepatic glycogen metabolism. For example, the sharp signal at 100.4 ppm of  
carbon C1 of  glycogen can be used to measure hepatic glycogen at different 
time points thus allowing the quantification of in vivo glycogenolysis or glycogen 
synthesis rates without any tracers (Rothman et al. 1991, Grueter et al. 1994) 
(Figure 1.8). Increased sensitivity of  13C MRS can be attained by tracing 13C 
incorporation into glycogen during infusion or ingestion of  labeled glucose 
(Magnusson et al. 1994, Choi et al. 2002, Krssak et al. 2004). 
 Moreover, the development of  technology that applies dynamic nuclear 
polarization to generate hyperpolarized 13C labeled metabolic substrates can 
totally change the clinical potential of  MRS of  13C labeled metabolic substrates 
by increasing dramatically the sensitivity of  13C MRS in vivo.

1.10.2. Assessment of  hepatic lipid metabolism by in vivo MRI and 
            1H MRS 
 Whole body and particularly hepatic triglyceride accumulation are closely 
associated with the onset of  IR and diabetes. Whole body lipid metabolism 
disorders can be assessed by anthropometric methods of  subcutaneous fat tissue 
and volume displacement measurements (Field et al. 2002). For measurement of  
whole body fat distribution, bioelectrical impedance analysis, ultrasound waves, 
double energy X-ray absorption, CT and MRI (T1-relaxation based contrast 
images) can be used. On the other hand, before the introduction of  Magnetic 
Resonance (MR) techniques (Szczepaniak et al. 1999), hepatic triglycerides 
accumulation was measured by means of  rather invasive liver biopsies or by 
qualitative ultrasound measurements.

degrees of  hepatic fatty infiltration. A single-voxel volume is defined in the region of  interest

 1H MRS can be applied to the noninvasive measurement of  hepatic 
triglycerides (Figure 1.9). However, by using single-voxel spectroscopy, only a 
small volume of  the liver region of  interest (ROI) is analyzed, not accounting for 



?? Chapter 1

intrinsic organ heterogeneity. More recently, the development of  more potent 
spectrometers together with continuous research on pulse sequence design, 
made it possible to perform multi-voxel spectroscopy. In here, different volumes 
within the ROI are chosen and in a relatively short time, multi-voxel spectra 
obtained. The quantification of  the intensity of  the relative signals from water

1.11. Scope, Aim and Outline of  Thesis

 In the last decades, IR and T2D are becoming more prevalent mainly 
due to alterations in dietary and life-styles. PTDM has also become a subject 
of  interest considering the elevated incidences that prevail in posttransplant 
patients under immunosuppressant therapy after solid organ transplantation. 
Hepatic glucose and lipid metabolic disruptions appear to play a central role in 
the onset of  IR, T2D and PTDM. Thus, by using novel stable isotope techniques 
combined with MR methodologies it is possible to study hepatic and glucose 
metabolism disruptions which are associated with the development of  these 
pathologies. The aim of  this Thesis is to define changes in hepatic glucose and 
lipid fluxes using stable isotope tracers and NMR analysis both in animal models 
and patients with IR, T2D or PTDM. Moreover, further developments of  
techniques for the study of  hepatic glucose metabolism from fasting to dynamic 
situations are challenged as well as for the integrated analysis of  hepatic glucose 
and lipid metabolism.
 In Chapter 2, fasting sources of  EGP are evaluated in rodents by using 
[3,4-13C

2
]glucose and 2H

2
O combined with 13C and 2H NMR spectroscopy. In 

addition, gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis relative contributions to EGP are 
assessed in a HF diet induced-IR animal model. 



	 	 	      Chapter 1 ??

 In Chapter 3, contributions of  gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis 
to fasting HGP are quantified in kidney transplant patients undergoing CsA 
immunosuppressant therapy. A novel Bayesian analysis of  the position 2 and 5 
2H NMR of  MAG derived from urinary acetaminophen glucuronide following 
2H

2
O and acetominophen ingestion is used.

 The fate of  a glucose load by 13C and 2H NMR analysis following 
administration of  [U-13C]glucose and 2H

2
O in healthy, HF diet-fed and CsA 

treated rodents is addressed in Chapter 4.  
 Chapter 5 describes postprandial hepatic glucose metabolism after 
a glucose load in healthy humans. Direct and indirect pathway contributions 
to hepatic glycogen synthesis during an OGTT are assessed by means of  two 
isotopic tracers ([U-13C]glucose and [U-2H

7
]glucose), following ingestion of  

peppermint oil and NMR analysis of  plasma glucose and menthol glucuronide 
13C and 2H-enrichments, respectively. 
 Sources of  hepatic triglycerides accumulation in healthy and HF diet-fed 
rats by using a novel 2H

2
O and 2H NMR methodology combined with in vivo 1H 

MRS for evaluation of  hepatic triglycerides content are determined in Chapter 
6. Finally, all the principal results of  the previous chapters are integrated and 
further discussed in Chapter 7.

2.1. Introduction
 
 Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogenous syndrome with metabolic 
disruptions that ultimately lead to hyperglycemia. While there are genetic factors 
that contribute to T2D, it can also be induced by environmental factors, such as 
oversupply of  dietary fat. Studies in both humans and animals have shown that 
an increased dietary fat intake results in reduced peripheral glucose uptake and/
or impaired suppression of  endogenous glucose production (EGP) (Thiebaud et 
al. 1982, Ferrannini et al. 1983, Kraegen et al. 1991, Boden et al. 1994). 
 In normal fasting conditions, the liver accounts for the bulk of  EGP 
through the hydrolysis of  glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to glucose via glucose-
6-phosphatase and the release of  glucose into the circulation. Hepatic 
gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis generate G6P and hence both pathways 
contribute	to	EGP.	Synthesis	of	G6P	from	these	sources	is	influenced	by	both	
substrate availability and endocrine status. In healthy overnight-fasted humans, 
EGP accounts for ~10 mmol kg-1min-1 with gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis 
each contributing with ~5 mmol kg-1min-1.	In	extended	fasting	(40-60	hours)	
hepatic	 glycogen	 stores	 are	 severely	 depleted	 and	 glycogenolysis	 fluxes	 are	
limited to ~ 1 mmol kg-1min-1.	To	sustain	EGP,	gluconeogenic	flux	is	enhanced	
and becomes the dominant contributor (Rothman et al. 1991, Chandramouli 
et al. 1997). Gluconeogenesis results in the generation of  glucose from non-
carbohydrate precursors: the glycerol that enters at the level of  the triose-
phosphates and all other precursors (i.e., pyruvate, lactate and gluconeogenic 
amino acids) which are metabolised via	the	anaplerotic	fluxes	of	the	tricarboxylic	
acids (TCA) cycle. 
	 Flux	changes	from	either	gluconeogenesis	or	glycogenolysis	can	alter	
EGP	 rates,	 and	 if	 EGP	 exceeds	 the	 rate	 of	 whole	 body	 glucose	 disposal,	
hyperglycemia occurs. In poorly controlled type 2 diabetics, overt fasting 
hyperglycemia is believed to result from enhanced EGP, mainly due to increased 



52 Chapter 2

gluconeogenesis (Consoli et al. 1989, Hundal et al. 2000,  Magnusson et al. 2002, 
Kunert et al. 2003). Gluconeogenesis may be stimulated in part by increased 
plasma free fatty acids (FFA) which supply the hepatic TCA cycle with an 
abundant	supply	of	oxidizable	substrate	that	can	fuel	the	synthesis	of	glucose	
from pyruvate and other precursors (Coppack et al	1994).	Moreover,	the	excess	
circulating	FFA	will	be	reesterified	in	the	liver,	thus	boosting	hepatic	triglyceride	
levels	and	contributing	to	hepatic	insulin	resistance	(DeFronzo	2004).	Hepatic	
insulin resistance refers to the inability of  insulin to suppress postprandial EGP 
and may be a key factor in the loss of  glucose homeostasis associated with 
obesity (Kim et al. 2003).
 In animal models, a high fat (HF) diet leads to insulin resistance and 
increased hepatic triglyceride levels. Therefore, the HF diet induced-insulin 
resistance animal model is widely used for the study of  the pathological events 
that	characterize	the	onset	of	T2D.	HF	diet-fed	animals	show	normal	fasting	
blood glucose levels, but are glucose intolerant and mildly insulin resistant as 
demonstrated by impaired clearance of  a glucose load (Kraegen et al. 1986, 
Storlien et al. 1986). Given the role of  systemic lipids in promoting EGP 
and	gluconeogenesis,	 it	 is	hypothesized	that	these	fluxes	would	be	 increased	
in HF diet-fed rats compared to animals fed with a standard chow (SC) diet. 
Possibly,	elevated	fasting	EGP	rates	reflect	a	loss	of	hepatic	glucose	control	and	
contributes to glucose intolerance through a less effective suppression of  EGP 
during a meal or a glucose load. If  the glucose intolerance induced by HF-diet 
is not accompanied by higher fasting EGP rates, the principal mechanism may 
lie with defective peripheral glucose clearance rather than with hepatic glucose 
control. 
 In order to investigate postabsorptive EGP rates, and the contributing 
fluxes	from	glycerol	and	TCA	cycle	gluconeogenesis,	and	glycogenolysis,	6-h	
fasted adult Sprague-Dawley rats fed with a HF diet for 20 days were infused 
with	a	mixture	of	[3,4-13C

2
]glucose and deuterated water (2H

2
O) tracers. EGP was 



	 	 	      Chapter 2 53

quantified	by	isotope	dilution	measurement	of	infused	[3,4-13C
2
]glucose and the 

contributions of  TCA cycle and glycerol gluconeogenesis, and glycogenolysis to 
EGP were estimated from the 2H-enrichment pattern of  monoacetone glucose 
(MAG) derived from plasma glucose. EGP rates and sources were also assessed 
in control animals fasted for 6-h as well as a second control group fasted for 
12 hours in order to determine if  the performed measurements appropriately 
represented EGP rates and sources during the fed to fasted transition.  

2.2. Materials and Methods

2.2.1. Materials

 [3,4-13C
2
]glucose (99%) was purchased from Omicron Biochemicals 

(South Bend, IN). Deuterated water (99.9%) and deuterated acetonitrile (99.8%) 
were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc. (Andover, MA, USA). 
Other common chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

2.2.2. Protocol

 The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee. Sprague-Dawley rats were housed in a room on a 12-h light-dark 
cycle under constant temperature (22-25 ºC) and with ad libitum access to food 
and	water.	Animals	were	divided	into	3	groups:	Group	1,	five	(5)	12-h	fasted	
control	animals;	Group	2,	five	(5)	6-h	fasted	control	rats;	Group	3,	6-h	fasted	
animals (n=6) maintained on a HF diet for 20 days. The HF diet used contained 
45% of  calories from fat, 35% from carbohydrate and 20% derived from protein 
(E15744-34, SSNIFF, Specialdiäten GmbH)®, whereas the SC diet given to control 
animals consists of  2.7% of  fat, 60% carbohydrate and 16% protein. At the day 
of	experiment,	animals	from	all	groups	showed	matched	body	weight	(340-380	
g).	After	the	corresponding	fast,	ketamine-(2-(2,6-xylidine)-5,6-dihydro-4H-1,3-

tiazine	chlorhydrate)	anesthetized	animals	were	cannulated	in	the	jugular	vein.	
Then, rats were submitted to an intravenous (i.v.) prime consisting of  2 mg of  
[3,4-13C

2
]glucose	and	an	intraperitoneal	(i.p.)	injection	of	4	mL	70%	saline	2H

2
O 

followed	by	infusion.	2.1	mg/mL	of	[3,4-13C
2
]glucose solution were infused at a 

constant rate of  0.33 mL/min. After a 60 min infusion, blood was immediately 
withdrawn	from	the	descending	aorta	and	the	liver	weighed,	freeze-clamped	and	
kept at -80ºC until further analysis. 

2.2.3. Blood processing

 Blood	 was	 immediately	 deproteinized	 with	 a	 final	 volume	 of	 4%	
perchloric acid (70%) and centrifuged at 13,000 g at 4ºC for plasma separation. 
The	plasma	supernatant	was	separated	from	erythrocytes	and	neutralized	with	
concentrated	KOH.	Samples	were	further	purified	by	anionic-cationic	exchange	
chromatography and evaporated to dryness. The conversion of  plasma glucose 
to MAG was performed according to the literature (Jones et al.	2001).	A	mixture	
of  0.5 mL acetone/mL original plasma and concentrated anhydrous H

2
SO

4
 (40 

mL/mL acetone) was added to the sample and stirred vigorously for 4 h. 10 
mL of  H

2
O	were	added	and	the	pH	adjusted	to	2.2-2.3	followed	by	incubation	

at	40	ºC	for	5	h.	The	pH	was	then	adjusted	to	~8.0	with	Na
2
CO

3
 and the 

solution	evaporated	to	dryness.	MAG	was	extracted	from	the	dry	residue	with	
5 mL of  boiling ethyl acetate, removal of  insoluble salts by centrifugation, and 
evaporation of  ethyl acetate. MAG molecules show the same labeling patterns 
as plasma glucose but with completely resolved 2H and 13C NMR signals.

2.2.4. Liver Processing

 Frozen	livers	were	freeze-dried	and	then	powdered.	30%	KOH	(at	70	ºC)	
was	added	to	each	sample	in	2:1	final	volume	ratio.	After	30	minutes,	8	mL	of	
Na

2
SO

4
 6% and 50 mL of  absolute ethanol were added and the sample incubated 

overnight at 4ºC. The precipitated glycogen is separated from the supernatant 



	 	 	      Chapter 2 55

by centrifugation at 3,000 g. The dried glycogen samples were dissolved in 5 
mL of  acetate buffer 0.05 M (pH 4.5). 16 U of  amyloglucosidase were added 
to each sample and incubated for 10 hours at 55 ºC. The containing glucose 
supernatant was then separated by centrifugation. Finally, glucose concentration 
in	each	sample	was	quantified	enzymatically	by	the	glucose	oxidase	method	using	
a commercial kit (Invitrogen).    

2.2.5. NMR Spectroscopy

 2.2.5.1. 13C NMR Spectroscopy

 MAG samples were dissolved in 90% deuterated acetonitrile/10% 
H

2
O for carbon 13 (13C) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis. Proton-

decoupled 13C NMR spectra were obtained with a Varian 11.75 Tesla (T) system 
(Varian Instruments, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a 5-mm broadband 
probe. Spectra were acquired at 25ºC using a 90º pulse and a 2.5 s acquisition 
time. Typically 4,000-40,000 scans were averaged. 

 2.2.5.1. 2H NMR Spectroscopy

 While 13C	NMR	signals	of	MAG	were	adequate	for	accurate	quantification	
in each blood sample, initial deuterium (2H) NMR spectra had poor signal to 
noise	ratio	(SNR)	and	were	deemed	unacceptable	for	reliable	quantification	of	
the H2, H5 and H6 signals (data not shown). Therefore, it was decided to pool 
the MAG samples for each group for 2H NMR spectroscopy after acquiring 
individual 13C NMR spectra. 2H NMR spectra of  pooled MAG samples were 
obtained using a Varian 14.1 T spectrometer (Varian Instruments, Palo Alto, 
CA, USA) equipped with a 3-mm broadband probe. MAG was dissolved in 
90% acetonitrile/10% water and shimming was performed on selected proton 
(1H) resonances of  MAG. 1H-decoupled 2H NMR spectra were acquired at 50ºC 
using a 90º pulse and a 1.5 s acquisition time. Typically 6,000-20,000 scans were 
averaged. 



56 Chapter 2

 2.2.5.3. NMR Analysis

 13C	NMR	spectra	were	analyzed	using	the	curve-fitting	routine	supplied	
with the NUTS PC-based NMR spectral analysis program (Acorn NMR Inc., 
Fremont CA). Analysis of  2H-enrichments was performed in an automated way 
by using Bayesian analysis (Varian Instruments) of  a 2H free induction decay 
(FID) signal from MAG pooled samples. 
 
2.2.6. Metabolic flux calculations

 Glucose rate of  appearance (Ra) was calculated from the known infusion 
rate	 (Ri),	 the	 enrichment	 fraction	of	 infusate	 [3,4-13C

2
]glucose (Li), and the 

fraction	of	plasma	glucose	that	was	[3,4-13C
2
]glucose (Lp), using Eq. 2.1 (Jin 

et al. 2003, Jin et al. 2004, Jin et al. 2005b).	The	fraction	of	[3,4-13C
2
]glucose 

in the plasma glucose (Lp) was determined from the ratio of  the areas of  the 
doublet due to 13C-13C spin-spin coupling between carbons 3 and 4 ( J

34
=37.8 

Hz)	compared	with	the	area	of	the	singlet	that	reflects	13C natural abundance 
(1.11%). EGP was calculated from Eq. 2.2 and is equal to Ra minus Ri. The 
contribution of  gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis to EGP was derived from 
the ratio of  2H-enrichment at positions 2, 5 and 6S of  MAG (H2, H5, H6S), as 
shown in Eqs. 2.3 and 2.4. G6P derived from glycogenolysis has deuterium in 
position	2	only,	as	a	result	of	exchange	between	G6P	and	fructose-6-phosphate	
(F6P), whereas G6P derived from any gluconeogenic precursor has deuterium 
incorporated	in	both	position	2	and	5	due	to	additional	exchanges	at	the	triose	
phosphate level (see Figure 2.1). Hence, the ratios of  2H-enrichment in positions 
5	and	2	(H5/H2)	of	G6P	and	plasma	glucose	reflect	the	fractional	contribution	
of  gluconeogenesis to fasting EGP. The contribution of  gluconeogenesis was 
resolved into glycerol and TCA cycle sources as shown by Eqs 2.5 and 2.6 
(Schleucher et al. 1998, Jones et al. 2001). 

Ra= Ri × (Li- Lp)/ Lp (mmol kg-1min-1)                                                           [Eq. 2.1] 
EGP= Ra – Ri (mmol kg-1min-1)                                            [Eq. 2.2]

when p&lt;0.05. Gluconeogenesis from TCA cycle and glycerol, and glycogenolysis 
estimated by Bayesian analysis are associated with an uncertainty, SD, given 
by the Markov Chain/Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations (Merritt et al. 2003).

value	with	a	95%	confidence.

and rats on a HF diet fasted for 6-h showed similar EGP rates, the 12-h fasted

     Figure 2.2. 13C NMR spectra of  monoacetone glucose (MAG) derived from plasma 
glucose of  rats infused with [3,4-13C2]glucose. Carbon	3	signals	are	expanded	and	a	doublet	
resulting from coupling of  carbon 3 with 4 (C3D34) is observed. A. 12-h fasted control rat; B. 
6-h fasted control; C. 6-h fast HF diet-fed animals. Carbon 3 natural abundance singlets (C3S) 
and	carbon	3-carbon	4	coupling	doublets	(C3D34)	are	identified.	

 Pooled 2H NMR spectra of  MAG derived from plasma glucose samples 
had well-resolved 2H-signals with high SNR for all seven aliphatic hydrogens 
of	glucose	(Figure	2.3)	allowing	the	precise	quantification	of	the	relative	2H-
enrichments	and	the	respective	metabolic	fluxes.	Generally,	the	precision	of	the	
flux	estimates,	as	determined	by	the	size	of	the	SD,	is	highest	for	spectra	with	
high SNR (Merritt et al. 2003). From the relative enrichments of  hydrogens 2, 
5 and 6S, the contributions from glycerol and TCA cycle gluconeogenesis, and 
glycogenolysis to EGP were estimated by Bayesian analysis and are shown in 
Figure 2.4
 For 6-h fasted control animals, EGP rates and gluconeogenic 
contributions were similar to other reports from early postabsorptive stage (5-
6 hours) (Sena et al. 2007). Gluconeogenesis contributed about half  of  EGP 
with	the	TCA	cycle	accounting	for	the	majority	of	gluconeogenic	sources	and	
glycerol	gluconeogenesis	only	accounting	for	~9%	of	EGP.	This	profile	reflects	
the abundance of  hepatic glycogen and low rates of  net lipolysis - the source of  
endogenous glycerol that is characteristic of  the initial hours of  fasting. Given 
the paucity of  published EGP values during early postabsorptive conditions and 
the	fact	that	a	60-min	primed	infusion	of	[3,4-13C

2
]glucose was used rather than 

the more usual 90 min an additional group of  12-hour fasted control animals 
was studied to determine if  these measurements appropriately represented EGP 
rates and sources during the fed to fasted transition.

	 	 	      Chapter 2 63

	 The	progression	of	fasting	is	characterized	by	a	well	defined	reduction	of	
glucose disposal rates as plasma glucose and insulin levels subside. The decline 
in whole body glucose disposal is matched by a reduction in EGP, principally as 
a	result	of	reduced	hepatic	glycogen	levels	and	glycogenolytic	fluxes.	For	the	12-
h	fasted	animals,	hepatic	glycogen	was	significantly	depleted	relative	to	the	6-h	
fasting	controls	(0.05	±	0.07	vs. 0.35	±	0.04	mmol/g	liver	wet	weight,	p&lt;0.01). 
Consistent with reduced liver glycogen levels, the glycogenolytic contribution 
was	sharply	lower	in	the	12-h	fasted	animals,	contributing	only	for	22%	±	7%	
of	EGP.	While	the	total	gluconeogenic	contribution	was	significantly	different	
between 6 and 12-h fasted (54% vs. 78%), the contribution from glycerol was 
not	significantly	altered	between	6	and	12	hours	of	fasting	(9%	±	6%	vs. 16% 
±	8%).	The	12	hour	fast	was	not	sufficient	to	induce	extensive	lipolysis	and	an	
increase	in	glycerol	availability.	However,	there	is	a	significant	drop	in	the	relative	
gluconeogenic	contribution	from	the	TCA	cycle	(70%	±	7%	compared	to	45%	
±	5%	for	the	6-h	fasted	control	group).	In	terms	of	absolute	fluxes,	the	dramatic	
drop in glycogenolysis contribution (15 vs. 45 mmol kg-1min-1) appears to be 
the	principal	responsible	for	decreased	EGP	fluxes	in	12-h	fasted	rats	whereas	
gluconeogenesis	from	the	TCA	cycle	flux	is	similar	between	6	and	12-h	fasted	
rats (45 vs. 47 mmol kg-1min-1, respectively). In conclusion, the measurements 
described in here appropriately describe the changes in EGP rates and sources 
that occur in healthy animals during the progression of  fasting.  
 Animals on a HF diet showed comparable EGP rates to 6-h fasted 
controls with minor shifts in the EGP sources. Glycogenolysis contribution, 
although	 significantly	 elevated	 in	HF	diet-fed	 animals	 relative	 to	6-h	 fasted	
controls	(56%	±	1%	vs.	46%	±	5%,	p&lt;0.05), only accounts for a modest increase 
to EGP whereas the gluconeogenic contribution from TCA cycle and glycerol 
to	EGP	was	not	significantly	different.	Hepatic	glycogen	 levels	were	similar	
between	the	HF	diet	and	the	6-h	fasted	controls	(0.25	±	0.12	vs.	0.35	±	0.10	
mmol/g liver wet weight).

2.4. Discussion   
 
 Fasting hyperglycemia in T2D is often associated with enhanced EGP 
rates. Previously, postabsorptive EGP was found to be increased in animal 
models of  T2D. In the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) animals, EGP was shown 
to be increased due to elevated glycogenolysis as a result of  elevated hepatic 
glycogen content (Jin et al. 2005a)	whereas	in	Goto-Kakizaki	(GK)	rats	increased	
EGP is due to enhanced gluconeogenesis from TCA cycle (Sena et al. 2007). 
Thus, in ZDF and GK rats with well developed T2D, enhanced EGP contributes 
to fasting hyperglycemia. To determine if  EGP is altered in glucose intolerant 
rats that show normal fasting glycemia, a rodent model of  HF-induced insulin 
resistance was studied.  
	 From	the	[3,4-13C

2
]glucose isotope dilution measurements, postabsorptive 

EGP	was	found	not	to	be	significantly	different	between	HF	diet-fed	and	control	
animals.	Furthermore,	there	was	no	indication	of	increased	gluconeogenic	fluxes	
in the HF diet-fed group. These results are not in agreement with a previous study 
where EGP was found to be increased in overnight-fasted HF diet-fed animals 
(Song et al.	2001),	determined	by	using	[6-3H]glucose as a tracer. However, their 
published EGP values of  20-30 mmol kg-1min-1 are far below from the 50-70 
mmol kg-1min-1 range from many studies (Jin et al. 2003, Jin et al. 2004, Nakahara 
et al.	2004)	and	the	value	of	67	±	8	mmol kg-1min-1 reported in here. 
 The results presented in here show that for HF diet-fed animals, 
postabsorptive EGP from gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis was essentially 
identical to the normally fed controls. These data therefore provide no indication 
of  stimulated hepatic gluconeogenesis in the fasted state as a result of  the HF 
diet. However, further studies are necessary to determine if  HF diet induced 
glucose intolerance results from altered whole body glucose disposal, failure of  
normal inhibition of  postprandial EGP or a combination of  both. HF diet-
fed animals present some important early markers of  T2D pathology including 



	 	 	      Chapter 2 65

glucose intolerance and increased hepatic triglyceride levels. However, the 
normal EGP and gluconeogenesis rates that were found in glucose-intolerant 
HF	diet-fed	animals	suggest	that	altered	hepatic	glucose	fluxes	are	not	involved	
in the development of  fasting hyperglycemia and insulin resistance secondary to 
high fat feeding, at least in the early stages.  
 These conclusions concur with clinical studies where postabsorptive 
EGP and gluconeogenic rates are normal in mildly hyperglycemic diabetics and 
are	only	significantly	enhanced	in	severe	hyperglycemic	type	2	diabetics	(Boden 
et al. 2001). These studies suggest that increases in postabsorptive EGP and 
gluconeogenesis rates are preceded by other defects of  glucose homeostasis such 
as insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in the pathogenesis of  T2D. Rather, 
the involvement of  elevated EGP and gluconeogenesis is associated with the 
onset of  severe fasting hyperglycemia, a relatively late event in the development 
of  T2D.

3.1. Introduction

Plasma glucose levels are maintained over the daily feeding/fasting 
cycle through tight coordination of  glucose appearance and disposal. During 
overnight fasting, glucose appearance is entirely accounted for by endogenous 
glucose production (EGP) once digestive absorption has ceased. Hepatic glucose 
production (HGP) is the principal contributor to EGP and both gluconeogenesis 
and glycogenolysis contribute to fasting HGP. The occurrence of  hyperglycemia 
after overnight fasting is a hallmark of  defective glucose metabolism and indicates 
a mismatch between glucose production and plasma glucose clearance. Impaired 
glucose uptake by peripheral tissues and inappropriately high levels of  HGP can 
both contribute to this condition. Among other things, resolving these underlying 
defects could prove useful for guiding and evaluating interventions of  fasting 
hyperglycemia since some antihyperglycemic medications act by inhibiting HGP 
while others function by improving whole body glucose uptake.
 Systemic glucose metabolism is typically assessed in the clinical setting by 
quantifying plasma glucose levels before and after an oral glucose load but this 
approach does not provide any information about hepatic glucose metabolism. 
Assessment of  HGP with stable isotope tracers could provide useful information 
to complement measurements of  plasma glucose clearance but current methods 
are poorly suited for routine clinical studies. This is due to several factors including 
high tracer cost, the requirement for lengthy infusion times for administration 
of  the tracer, and extensive sample processing and analysis.
 Deuterated water (2H

2
O) is an inexpensive tracer of  gluconeogenesis 

that can be administered orally and is therefore well suited for routine clinical 
study procedures. The metabolic information is derived from the analysis of  
the deuterium (2H)-enrichment distribution of  plasma glucose (Jones et al. 2001, 
Boden et al. 2001, Landau et al. 1996, Chandramouli et al. 1997, Perdigoto et 
al. 2003, Weis et al. 2004, Chevalier et al. 2006). Current Gas Chromatography-



72 Chapter 3

Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) methods, while highly sensitive and therefore 
applicable to small blood samples, are labor intensive and poorly suited for 
high sample throughputs. Analysis by 2H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) 
spectroscopy of  the monoacetone glucose (MAG) derivative of  plasma glucose 
is less sensitive but far simpler to the extent that both sample preparation and 
NMR spectroscopy can be extensively automated with current technologies. 
Conversion of  plasma glucose to MAG has been successfully performed with 
a commercially available robotic chemical synthesizer (Burgess et al. 2002) and 
high-resolution 2H NMR spectra of  the product can be obtained with automated 
tuning/shimming routines and minimal technical oversight. The contribution of  
gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic fluxes to HGP can be automatically obtained 
from the 2H NMR signal by Bayesian/Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 
analysis of  the free induction decay (FID) (Merritt et al. 2003). The analysis also 
provides estimates of  uncertainty levels for the flux parameters. Data modeling 
studies indicate that these uncertainty levels are heavily influenced by the signal 
to noise ratio (SNR) of  the 2H NMR signals. Obtention of  2H NMR signals 
with suitable SNR for Bayesian analysis requires a large sample size (~30 mL of  
whole blood) and/or long NMR collection times thereby limiting the practicality 
and throughput of  the method.

When acetaminophen is provided and due to rapid exchange between 
hepatic glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) the 2H-
enrichment distribution of  plasma glucose is also reflected in hydrogens 1-5 of  
the acetaminophen glucuronide excreted in urine (Burgess et al. 2003) (Figure 3.1). 
In addition to eliminating the need to collect and rapidly process blood samples, 
the quantity of  urinary glucuronide that is available for analysis is typically 5-
10 times that of  plasma glucose. Under these conditions, it is anticipated that 
2H NMR spectra with sufficient SNR to yield reasonably precise estimates of  
gluconeogenesis by Bayesian analysis could be obtained without prohibitively 
long NMR collection times. The Bayesian method is ideal for analyzing data of  



	 	 	      Chapter 3 73

this type. Experimental time constraints prevent repeated measurements upon 
the same sample in order to construct a more traditional statistical estimate of  
the uncertainty, i.e., the mean and standard deviation (SD) of  repeated NMR 
spectra for a given sample. The Bayesian formulation of  this problem uses prior 
knowledge regarding the shifts and amplitudes of  the relevant resonances as 
well as a model for the “nuisance” resonances that are not important for the 
metabolic measurements. A MCMC simulation makes multiple independent 
analyses of  the posterior probability distribution that define the metabolic 
measurement. This provides an estimate of  the most probable values of  the 
metabolic parameters as well as the uncertainty value for each parameter.

In this study, the gluconeogenic contribution to HGP was estimated 
by Bayesian analysis of  the 2H NMR signals of  MAG derived from urinary 
acetaminophen glucuronide collected after overnight fasting and ingestion of  
2H

2
O and acetaminophen. The analysis was applied to healthy subjects and 

to kidney transplant (KTx) recipients, including a subgroup diagnosed with 
posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM). The development of  hyperglycemia and 
PTDM is a frequent event following kidney transplantation (Salvadori et al. 2003, 
Markell 2004). This may involve several factors, including increased adiposity, and 
glucose intolerance resulting from posttransplant weight gain, age and ethnicity 
(Salvadori et al. 2003), as well as the direct action of  immunosuppressive agents 
such as glucocorticoids (GCs) and the calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporine A 
(CsA), on insulin secretion and sensitivity (Jindal et al. 1997, Markell 2001). The 
activity of  hepatic gluconeogenesis and its contribution to posttransplant fasting 
hyperglycemia under these conditions is not known. In this study, sources of  
fasting HGP derived by Bayesian analysis were collated with plasma metabolite 
and insulin sensitivity measurements.

3.2. Materials and methods

3.2.1. Human studies

 The study protocol was approved by the University Hospital of  
Coimbra Ethics Committee and was performed in accordance with the ethical 
standards laid down in the Helsinki Declaration. Subjects were studied in the 
Department of  Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes in the University 
Hospital of  Coimbra after informed consent. Three groups were studied as 
follows: Group 1, six healthy, lean normoglycemic controls; Group 2, seven lean, 
normoglycemic patients with a functional KTx with stable ongoing CsA-based 
therapy; and Group 3, three obese and hyperglycemic patients with a functional 



	 	 	      Chapter 3 75

renal transplant and CsA-based therapy. All KTx patients received 200-400 mg/
day of  CsA in conjunction with a low dose of  GCs (5 mg/day).
 
3.2.2. 2H2O administration and sampling

Fasting was started at 20:00 (24-h clock) on the previous evening after a 
normal dinner meal. At 01:00 and 03:00 on the next day, patients were given two 
loading doses of  2H

2
O (2.5 g/kg of  body water) to achieve a target body water 

enrichment of  0.5% 2H
2
O. Body water was assumed to be 60% of  body weight 

for males and 50% of  body weight for females. To improve palatability and 
decrease the risk of  vertigo each loading was diluted with bottled spring water to 
give a final enrichment of  35% 2H

2
O. Acetaminophen (1000 mg) was also taken 

at 03:00 h. At 06:00 h the patients were asked to empty their bladder and all urine 
was collected from 06:00-08:00 h. Blood for clinical analysis was also drawn at 
06:00 and 08:00 (Figure 3.2).

3.2.3. Biochemical analysis

	 Blood collected after 10 h of  fasting was analyzed for plasma glucose, 
insulin, C peptide, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, glycosylated hemoglobin, 
creatinine and ureic nitrogen levels in the laboratories of  the University Hospital 
of  Coimbra. Plasma free fatty acids (FFA) were determined independently, using 
an enzymatic colorimetric method kit from Wako Chemicals GmbH, in plasma 
collected after 12 h of  fasting.

3.2.4. Sample processing

 Acetaminophen glucuronide from the 06:00-08:00 h urine samples was 
derived to MAG as previously described (Jones et al. 2006a, Jones et al. 2006b). 
Briefly, urine was concentrated by evaporation to 10% of  its original volume and 
this portion was mixed with 9 volumes of  ethanol (100%). The precipitate was 
centrifuged, the supernatant was evaporated to ~10 mL and the pH was adjusted 
to 8.0-9.0 with 1M NaOH. The supernatant was applied to an 18 × 1 cm diameter 
Dowex-1X8-200-acetate column. The column was washed with 35 mL of  water, 
the glucuronide eluted with 35 mL of  10 M acetic acid, and the collected acetic acid 
fraction was evaporated to dryness at 40-50 ºC. The residue was resuspended in 
50 mL water and the pH was adjusted to 4.5-5.0. The acetaminophen glucuronide 
in this solution was derivatized to monoacetoneglucuronic lactone (MAGL). Two 
thousand units of  ?-glucuronidase (H. Pomatia, Sigma Chemical Company) were 
added and the solution was incubated at 45ºC for 48 h. The solution was then 
passed through 10 mL Dowex-50X8-200 H+ ion-exchange resin and evaporated 
to complete dryness at 40 ºC resulting in the conversion of  free glucuronic acid 
to glucuronolactone. The lactone was converted to MAGL by stirring for 24 h 
with 5 mL of  anhydrous acetone and 0.1 mL concentrated H

SO

. The yellow 

solution was mixed with 5 mL water, the pH adjusted to between 4 and  5  with  
0.5 M Na

2
CO

3
 and the solution evaporated to dryness at room temperature. 



	 	 	      Chapter 3 77

MAGL was extracted from the salt products with 2-3 mL acetonitrile and 
reduced to MAG with lithium borohydride using tetrahydrofuran as the solvent. 
MAG molecules show the same labeling patterns as urinary acetominophen 
glucuronide but with completely resolved 2H NMR signals.

3.2.5. 2H NMR spectroscopy

 2H NMR spectra were acquired at 11.75 Tesla (T) with a Varian spectrometer 
equipped with a 5-mm broadband “switchable” probe with z-gradient (Varian, Palo 
Alto, CA, USA). MAG was dissolved in 90% acetonitrile/10% water and shimming 
was performed on selected proton (1H) resonances of  MAG. 1H-decoupled 2H 
NMR spectra were acquired without field-frequency lock at 50ºC using a 90º pulse 
and a 1.6 s acquisition time. Typically 6,000-30,000 FID were collected (2.7-13.5 h 
total collection time). For the determination of  urine water 2H-enrichment, spectra 
were obtained at 25ºC using a 22.5º pulse and a 4 s acquisition time (Jones et al. 
2001b). 

3.2.6. Bayesian/MCMC analysis of  glucuronide metabolic fluxes

 G6P derived from glycogenolysis has deuterium in position 2, as a result 
of  exchange between G6P and fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) whereas G6P derived 
from any gluconeogenic precursor has deuterium incorporated in both position 
2 and 5 due to additional exchanges at the triose phosphate level (Figure 3.1). 
Hence, the ratios of  2H-enrichment in positions 5 and 2 (H5/H2) of  G6P and 
plasma glucose reflect the fractional contribution of  gluconeogenesis to fasting 
glucose production. The glucuronide moiety of  acetaminophen is assumed to be 
derived from the hepatic uridine diphosphate-glucose (UDP-glucose) pool that is 
in isotopic steady state with hepatic G6P as a result of  rapid G6P-G1P exchange 
(Schwenk and Kahl 1996). On this basis, glucuronide H5/H2 is identical to 
that of  hepatic G6P and the fractional contributions of  gluconeogenesis and 
glycogenolysis to HGP are given by the following equations:



78 Chapter 3

Gluconeogenesis fraction = Glucuronide H5/Glucuronide H2 ×100 (%)   [Eq. 3.1]

Glycogenolysis fraction = 1 – (Glucuronide H5/Glucuronide H2) ×100 (%)  [Eq. 3.2]

 The H5/H2 parameter is thus obtained from the ratio of  the glucuronide 
2H NMR signals for these positions. This parameter can be obtained in an 
operator-independent manner by Bayesian analysis of  the FID as previously 
described (Merritt et al. 2003). The posterior probability distribution for the 
gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis fractions was obtained from a MCMC 
simulation consisting of  50 independent Markov chains, from each of  which 50 
independent samples were drawn (a total of  2,500 samples (Merritt et al. 2003)). 
Estimates of  the mean and SD for each flux parameter were derived from this 
sample set.

3.2.7. Data analysis
Statistical differences were determined using one-way analysis of  variance 

(ANOVA). The difference was considered statistical significant when p&lt;0.05.

3.3. Results 

3.3.1. Plasma metabolite and hormone levels
Table 3.1 provides a summary of  plasma metabolite and insulin levels 

along with body mass index (BMI), age and gender for all subjects. There were 
no significant differences in the plasma levels of  insulin, C peptide, cholesterol, 
HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and FFA between healthy 
control and either of  the KTx patient groups. Homeostatic model assessment 
of  insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), calculated using fasting plasma glucose and 
insulin, showed no significant differences among all the groups studied. All 
patients treated with CsA showed significant increases in plasma creatinine and 
ureic nitrogen relative to healthy controls. These observations likely reflect an 
impairment in kidney function due to the nephrotoxic effects of  CsA (Myers et 
al. 1986).

80 Chapter 3

Hyperglycemic patients had significantly higher fasting plasma glucose 
levels on the morning of  the study as well as higher values of  glycosylated 
hemoglobin. This indicates that the hyperglycemia in these patients was well 
established prior to the study. This group also had a significantly higher BMI 
and age average compared to both normoglycemic transplant patients and to the 
healthy control group. 

3.3.2. 2H-enrichment distribution of  body water and urinary glucuronide

Steady-state body water enrichments were 0.53% ± 0.01% in the 
hyperglycemic obese KTx patients treated with CsA. This was significantly higher 
than that of  controls, (0.43% ± 0.01%, p &amp;lt;0.01) and of  the normoglycemic 
KTx patients treated with CsA, (0.48% ± 0.02%, p &amp;lt;0.05). These results are 
consistent with a reduction in body water and an increased body fat fraction for 
hyperglycemic posttransplant patients.

2H NMR spectra of  MAG derived from acetaminophen glucuronide 
generated well-resolved 2H MAG resonances with the hydrogen 5 signal SNR 
ranging from 20:1 to 60:1 (Figure 3.3 and Table 3.2). Both the sample mass and 
the 2H NMR spectra derived from healthy controls were consistent with those 
recently reported in a study of  overnight-fasted healthy controls (Jones et al. 
2006b). Enrichment of  position 2, reflecting isotope equilibration with body 
water, was estimated to be 86% ± 12% that of  body water. This indicates that 
the exchange between hydrogen 2 of  hepatic G6P and that of  body water via 
interconversion of  G6P and F6P was essentially complete. This is in agreement 
with recent reports where it was found that after 5 hours of  2H

2
O incubation, 

plasma 2H
2
O and H2 were equilibrated (Jones et. al 2006). Other MAG 2H-signals 

corresponding to positions 3, 4 and 5 of  glucuronide were less intense, indicating 
dilution of  2H-enrichment at these sites by G6P derived from unlabeled hepatic 
glycogen. As was previously observed with glucuronide enrichment distributions 
from 2H

2
O in healthy subjects and in type 1 diabetic patients, the hydrogen 4 



	 	 	      Chapter 3 81

and 5 positions were enriched to similar levels (Burgess et al. 2003, Jones et al. 
2006b). The ratio of  hydrogen 3 enrichment relative to hydrogen 2 (H3/H2) was 
significantly lower than that of  H5/H2 (0.26 ± 0.02 vs. 0.47 ± 0.05, p&amp;lt;0.005 
for controls; and 0.45 ± 0.04 vs. 0.62 ± 0.03, p&amp;lt;0.0002 for KTx patients). 
The difference in enrichment between positions 3 and 5 could be the result 
of  incomplete exchange of 1R-dihydroxyacetone phosphate (the precursor of  
G6P hydrogen 3) with body water deuterium via triose phosphate isomerase, 
possibly due to isotopic discrimination. If  so, then hydrogen 3 enrichment would 
systematically underestimate the gluconeogenic contribution to HGP. 

In addition, the difference in enrichment between hydrogens 3 and 5 
could also reflect transaldolase (TA) activity, which catalyzes the exchange of  
the 456 carbon fragment of  F6P with free glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (Stingl

et al. 2006, Jones et al. 2008). Since TA exchange results in the enrichment of  
unlabeled F6P (i.e., that derived from glycogenolysis) in positions 4, 5 and 6, this 
activity would contribute to hydrogen 5 enrichment of  G6P independently of  
gluconeogenic flux, whereas hydrogen 3 enrichment would not be affected.

3.3.4. Gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis contributions to hepatic 
            glucose production by Bayesian/MCMC analysis

A summary of  the Bayesian/MCMC estimates of  the fractional 
contributions of  gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis to HGP for each subject 
is shown in Table 3.2, along with the SNR of  the Fourier-transformed 2H NMR 
spectrum of  MAG. Generally, the precision of  the flux estimates, as determined 
by the size of  the SD, was highest for spectra with high SNR. These results 
also indicate that the precision of  the Bayesian analysis is related to the relative 
intensities of  the H5 and H2 signals independently of  their individual SNR. As 
seen in Table 3.2, 2H NMR spectra derived from controls and from hyperglycemic 
KTx patients had comparable SNR for H2 and H5. However, metabolic flux 
outputs from the spectra of  the KTx patients had smaller SD compared to those 
of  controls (5% ± 1% vs. 7% ± 2%). Aside from a higher H5/H2 intensity ratio 
(0.64 vs. 0.54), the spectra derived from the patients were similar to those of  the 
control group in terms of  signal linewidths and resolution. These results suggest 
that when the gluconeogenic contribution is low (i.e., less than 50% of  HGP), 
the H5 signal SNR should be at least 60:1 in order to obtain reasonably low 
levels of  uncertainty (i.e., a coefficient of  variation of  10% or less). With higher 
gluconeogenic contributions (&gt; 65% of  HGP), a similar level of  precision can 
be obtained from spectra with H5 SNR ratios of  only ~30:1.

84 Chapter 3

 For the six control subjects, the mean contribution of  gluconeogenesis 
and glycogenolysis to HGP was 54% ± 7% and 46% ± 7%, respectively. This is 
in good agreement with previous estimates of  gluconeogenesis derived by the 
2H

2
O method using 2H NMR analysis of  MAG derived from plasma glucose  

(Jones et al. 2001, Perdigoto et al. 2003, Burgess et al. 2003) as well as GC-MS 
analysis of  plasma glucose (Landau et al. 1996, Chandramouli et al. 1997). These 
data are also in good agreement with values obtained by 2H NMR analysis of  
MAG derived from urinary glucuronide (Burgess et. al 2003, Jones et al. 2006b).
 

 The gluconeogenic and glycogenolysis contribution to HGP for all the 
patients on CsA treatment is 64% ± 7% and 36% ± 7%, respectively (p&amp;lt;0.05, 
relative to controls). The lean normoglycemic KTx patients had a wider range 
of  gluconeogenic contributions to HGP with a tendency towards a modestly 
increased gluconeogenic contribution to HGP (p = 0.06 relative to controls).

For the obese, hyperglycemic KTx patients, the gluconeogenic contribution to 
glucose production approached 70%. This estimate is somewhat higher than the 
value of  64% determined in healthy obese subjects by the 2H

2
O method but is 

in excellent agreement with the value of  68% obtained from obese subjects with 
type 2 diabetes (Gastaldelli et al. 2000) (Table 3.2 and Figure 3.4). There was no 
significant relationship between the fractional contribution of  gluconeogenesis 
and any of  the reported clinical parameters.

3.4. Discussion

The reported work demonstrates the feasibility and some limitations for 
quantifying fractional gluconeogenesis from Landau´s 2H

2
O method by Bayesian 

time-domain analysis of  glucuronide enrichment in positions 5 and 2. As a result 
of  the relatively large sample mass provided by glucuronide harvesting, 2H NMR 
spectra with high SNR were obtained with a standard 11.75 T spectrometer and 
a 5 mm broadband probe. The accuracy precision of  the Bayesian analysis is 
largely dependent on the SNR of  the 2H NMR spectrum. Among other things, 
this is a valuable tool for objectively determining the relationship between the 
sample collection time and statistical power of  the analysis. 

From the patient´s perspective, urinary glucuronide analysis is a more 
convenient and less invasive alternative to blood sampling. In addition, urinary 
glucuronide is far less susceptible than plasma glucose to degradation from 
delayed processing or storage above -80°C. Plasma glucose storage at -20°C for 
more than one month results in a marked decrease in glucose recovery as MAG 
whereas urinary glucuronide is stable for at least 4 months under these conditions. 
However, there are several disadvantages of  acetaminophen glucuronide analysis 
compared to that of  plasma glucose. The derivatization of  acetaminophen 
glucuronide to MAG involves several additional steps compared to that of  



86 Chapter 3

plasma glucose and is therefore far less amenable for routine automation. In 
principle, the Bayesian analysis could be applied to 2H NMR data of  alternative 
glucuronides such as menthol glucuronide which can be more easily purified 
from urine and has fully resolved glucuronide 2H-signals in its original form 
(Ribeiro et al. 2005, Mendes et al. 2006). 

Compared to plasma glucose, the analysis of  glucuronide 2H-enrichment 
is less informative since the hexose position 6 hydrogens are removed during 
the conversion of  UDP-glucose to glucuronide. The absence of  position 6 
2H-enrichment  information means that the contributions of  the TCA cycle 
and glycerol to gluconeogenesis, which relies on quantifying 2H-enrichment in 
both position 5 and 6 (Landau et al. 1996), is not resolved. Gluconeogenesis 
measurement cannot be performed if  there are contraindications to 
acetaminophen, such as advanced cirrhosis, or if  the subject is inherently 
unable to synthesize significant levels of  glucuronide, such as patients with 
uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyl transferase deficiency (Demorais et al. 
1992). There is additional uncertainty in the glucuronide sampling interval due 
to a 30-to 60-min lag time from its hepatic site of  formation to reaching the 
bladder (Hellerstein et al. 1987). Moreover, hepatic glucuronide and glucose may 
exhibit different enrichment patterns from certain tracers as a result of  hepatic 
metabolic zonation (Ekberg et al. 1995). Glycogen metabolism and glucuronide 
synthesis are both located in the pericentral region of  the hepatic lobule whereas 
glucose secretion is predominantly in the periportal region (Jungermann 1986, 
Jungermann and Thurman 1992). To the extent that there is a difference in 
the gluconeogenic contribution to G6P synthesis in periportal vs. pericentral 
hepatocytes, plasma glucose and urinary glucuronide could report different 
fractional contributions of  gluconeogenesis to HGP. For a small group of  
healthy subjects, plasma glucose and urinary glucuronide provided equivalent 
estimates of  gluconeogenesis (Burgess et al. 2003), but this has not been tested in 
larger subject populations or in patients with disorders of  glucose metabolism.



	 	 	      Chapter 3 87

The results described in here suggest that the gluconeogenic contribution 
to HGP had a tendency to be modestly higher in lean normoglycemic KTx 
patients undergoing CsA-based immunosuppressant therapy compared to 
healthy controls, but this difference did not reach statistical significance in 
this study. Substrate selection for HGP can be modified by changes in insulin 
action as well as by the availability of  oxidizable substrates such as FFA. Hepatic 
glycogenolysis is suppressed by insulin and enhanced by glucagon and is therefore 
sensitive to alterations in plasma insulin levels (Surmely et al. 1999). FFA can 
stimulate gluconeogenesis, possibly via augmentation of  hepatic adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) 
production (Chen et al. 1999, Boden et al. 2002). They may also increase the rate 
of  glycogenolysis by impairing its suppression by insulin (Boden et al. 2002). 
While CsA has been reported to reduce pancreatic insulin secretion (Hjelmesaeth 
et al. 2007) possibly by inducing pancreatic ?-cells apoptosis (Penfornis and 
Kury-Paulin 2006), neither the normo- nor the hyperglycemic CsA patients of  
this study had significantly different plasma insulin levels compared to healthy 
controls, at least under basal fasting conditions. Therefore, the data reported 
in here suggests that the observed alterations in HGP sources are not due to 
defective insulin secretion during fasting. Moreover, HOMA-IR indices for the 
three subject groups were similar suggesting that insulin sensitivity, as determined 
by this method, was not significantly modified in KTx patients. While plasma 
FFA levels were not significantly different between healthy, lean/normoglycemic 
and obese/hyperglycemic KTx patients, there was a tendency for FFA levels 
to be higher in the KTx patients, with the highest values found in the obese 
group.

3.5. Conclusions

In summary, for KTx patients undergoing CsA immunosuppressant 
therapy, the gluconeogenic contribution to HGP is significantly increased in the 
setting of  PTDM. This metabolic alteration is most strongly associated with 
adiposity and BMI, but may also be associated with elevated plasma FFA. There 
was no association between the gluconeogenic contribution to HGP and either 
fasting plasma insulin levels or insulin sensitivity as determined by HOMA-IR. 
CsA treatment per se appears to provoke only modest alterations of  HGP sources 
and is not associated with fasting hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia. Finally, 
the Bayesian analysis of  urinary glucuronide 2H-enrichment allows an objective 
evaluation of  hepatic HGP sources to be easily integrated with other simple and 
practical measurements of  human glucose homeostasis.

4.1. Introduction

 Hepatic glucose metabolism plays an important role in whole body 
glucose homeostasis. In fasting, the liver accounts for the bulk of  endogenous 
glucose production with glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis both contributing 
to hepatic glucose production (HGP). After an overnight-fast gluconeogenesis 
and glycogenolsysis contribute equally to HGP whereas with increased fasting, 
hepatic glycogen stores are depleted and gluconeogenesis contribution is 
enhanced (Rothman et al. 1991, Landau et al. 1996).
 During absorption of  a meal, the liver receives a relatively high 
concentration of  glucose via the portal vein. The increased glucose levels per se 
activate glucokinase to phosphorylate hepatic glucose to glucose-6-phosphate 
(G6P). The elevated G6P concentrations have a synergistic effect with glucose 
in promoting the inactivation of  glycogen phosphorylase and inducing glycogen 
synthesis through glycogen synthase activation. Moreover, the increased glucose 
levels stimulate insulin secretion by pancreatic b-cells. Insulin further activates 
glucokinase by promoting its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm 
whereas elevated plasma insulin to glucagon ratio activate glycogen synthase, 
inhibit glycogen phosphorylase and are also responsible for inactivation of  some 
key gluconeogenic regulatory enzymes such as phosphoenolpyruvate kinase 
(PEPCK). Overall, hyperinsulinemia promotes hepatic glucose uptake, storage 
as glycogen, and suppression of  HGP. After a glucose load, ~20% of  the glucose 
is cleared by the liver and deposited as glycogen (Petersen et al. 2001).
 In addition, glucose and insulin stimulate glucose uptake by insulin-
sensitive peripheral tissues, including skeletal muscle and adipocytes. Hence, 
through the reduction of  HGP and an increase in glucose disposal, plasma glucose 
levels are quickly restored to normal limits following carbohydrate ingestion and 
absorption. A defect in one or both of  these mechanisms reduces the capacity 
for glucose homeostasis under these conditions and forms the definition of  



96 Chapter 4

glucose intolerance. In the clinical setting, glucose intolerance is interrogated by a 
glucose tolerance test (GTT). In humans, glucose can be administrated by means 
of  an intravenous (i.v.) infusion, the intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), 
included in an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or in the carbohydrate 
component of  a mixed meal ingestion test. In small animal models, such as rats 
and mice, glucose intolerance may be assessed by IVGTT and OGTT protocols 
but the glucose load is also often delivered as an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, 
i.p. glucose tolerance test (IPGTT), because this method is more convenient 
compared to the other administration procedures.   
 In its current form, a glucose tolerance test can identify a defined level of  
glucose intolerance, but does not identify or resolve the underlying causes, which 
may include impaired glucose clearance, impaired suppression of  HGP, or both. 
By introducing tracers into the load and analyzing their entry and clearance into 
plasma glucose and hepatic glycogen, the hepatic and peripheral components of  
glucose homeostasis can be resolved. 
 In this study, the fate of  an i.p. glucose load enriched with [U-13C]glucose 
and deuterated water (2H

2
O) was studied. Entry and clearance of  the load 

through plasma glucose and the effects of  the load on HGP were assessed by 
the analysis of  plasma glucose enrichment from both tracers. This measurement 
was applied to Sprague-Dawley rats fasted for 6 hours. From the perspective of  
hepatic glucose metabolism, this fasting period corresponds to that of  overnight-
fasting in humans, the standard starting point for a glucose tolerance test in the 
clinical setting. The contribution of  HGP to total body glucose was determined 
from the deuterium (2H)-enrichment of  plasma glucose position 2 relative to 
that of  plasma water (PW) (Allick et al. 2006). The fraction of  plasma glucose 
derived from gluconeogenic sources was quantified from the 2H-enrichment 
levels at position 5 of  plasma glucose relative to that of  PW. The contribution 
of  the i.p. load to plasma and total body glucose was estimated from the carbon 
13 (13C)-enrichment level of  plasma [U-13C]glucose relative to that of  the load. 



	 	 	      Chapter 4 97

Enrichments of  plasma glucose by [U-13C]glucose and 2H
2
O were resolved by 

2H and 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. 
 These measurements were applied to a group of  healthy animals fed 
with a standard chow (SC) diet to obtain baseline estimates of  glucose kinetics. 
To investigate the changes in glucose kinetics that accompany the onset of  
glucose intolerance induced by dietary or by pharmacological interventions, 
two further groups of  animals were studied. In one group, glucose intolerance 
was induced as a result of  high fat (HF) diet feeding. Previous studies have 
shown that rats placed on a HF diet show normal fasting blood glucose but 
when challenged with a glucose load they reveal glucose intolerance secondary 
to insulin resistance (Kraegen et al. 1986, Storlien et al. 1986). The underlying flux 
mechanisms that contribute to glucose intolerance have not yet been defined 
in this model. In the other group, glucose intolerance in normally-fed animals 
was induced after administration of  Cyclosporine A (CsA). CsA is currently the 
most widely used agent for suppressing the host immune response following 
solid organ transplantation. It has recently been implicated in the promotion of  
glucose intolerance and posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM), mainly through 
disruption of  pancreatic b-cell function in vivo (Doyle et al. 2003). The effect of  
CsA on glucose clearance and HGP fluxes in relation to the development of  
glucose intolerance is not known.

4.2. Materials and Methods

4.2.1. Materials 

 [U-13C]glucose (99%) and 2H
2
O (99.9%) were obtained from Cambridge 

Isotope Laboratories Inc. (Andover, MA, USA). CsA and other common 
chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The HF diet used contained 
45% of  calories from fat, 35% from carbohydrate and 20% derived from protein 



98 Chapter 4

(E15744-34, SSNIFF, Specialdiäten GmbH)®. SC diet contains 2.7% of  fat, 60% 
carbohydrate and 16% protein.

4.2.2. Treatment protocol   
 The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were housed in a room on a 12-h light-
dark cycle under constant temperature (22-25 ºC) and with ad libitum access to 
food and water. Animals were separated into different groups: Group 1, control 
animals maintained on a SC diet for 20 days; Group 2, animals maintained for 20 
days on a HF diet; and Group 3, rats maintained on a SC diet and given daily an 
i.p. injection of  CsA (15 mg/kg body weight). This dose was chosen according 
to previous studies in literature (Mazzoni et al. 1986). At the day of  the study, 
all groups of  animals were matched for body weight (Group 1, 318 ± 13 g; 
Group 2, 324 ± 20 g; Group 3, 313 ± 18 g). The number of  animals for each 
experiment is indicated in the legend of  the figures.

4.2.3. Intra-peritoneal glucose tolerance test protocol (IPGTT)

 After 6-h fasting, rats were challenged with an i.p. glucose load (1.5 mg 
glucose/g body weight) 9.6 % enriched with [U-13C]glucose and dissolved in 
4 mL of  70% 2H

2
O-saline. After the i.p. glucose load, control animals were 

sacrificed at different time points during a 60 min period. Animals on a HF diet 
or treated with CsA were sacrificed after 60 min and compared to the respective 
controls. At the pre-defined intervals, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane 
anesthetic, blood was immediately withdrawn from the descending aorta and the 
liver weighted, freeze-clamped and kept at -80ºC until further analysis. Blood 
glucose and plasma insulin levels were assessed using a standard glucometer and 
an ELISA kit from Lynco, respectively.



	 	 	      Chapter 4 99

4.2.4. Blood processing

 Blood was immediately deproteinized with a final volume of  4% 
perchloric acid (70%) and centrifuged at 13,000 g at 4ºC for plasma separation. 
The plasma supernatant was separated from erythrocytes and neutralized with 
concentrated KOH. Samples were further purified by anionic-cationic exchange 
chromatography and evaporated to dryness. The conversion of  plasma glucose 
to monoacetone glucose (MAG) was performed according to the literature 
(Jones et al. 2001). 

4.2.5. Liver Processing

 Frozen livers were freeze-dried and then powdered. 30% KOH at 70ºC 
was added to each sample in 2:1 (v/v). After 30 minutes, 8 mL of  Na

2
SO

4 

6% and 50 mL of  absolute ethanol were added and the sample incubated 
overnight at 4ºC. The precipitated glycogen was separated from the supernatant 
by centrifugation at 3,000 g and dissolved in 5 mL of  acetate buffer 0.05 M 
(pH 4.5). 16 U of  amyloglucosidase were added to each sample and incubated 
for 10 hours at 55ºC. The containing glucose supernatant was then separated 
by centrifugation and derivatized to MAG according to literature (Jones et al. 
2001).

and 13C NMR signals.

4.2.7. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy 
 4.2.7.1. 2H NMR Spectroscopy

 2H NMR spectra from plasma MAG pooled samples and MAG from 
hepatic glycogen glucose monomers were obtained using a Varian 14.1 Tesla (T) 
spectrometer (Varian Instruments, Palo Alto, CA, USA). MAG was dissolved in 
90% acetonitrile/10% water and shimming was performed on selected MAG 
proton (1H) resonances. 1H-decoupled 2H NMR spectra were acquired at 50ºC 
using a 90º pulse, a 1.5 s acquisition time and 0.1 s interpulse delay. Typically 
6,000-20,000 scans were averaged. For the determination of  PW 2H-enrichment, 
using the method described in Jones et al., spectra were obtained at 25ºC using a 
22.5º pulse and a 4 s acquisition time  (Jones et al. 2001). 

 4.2.7.2. 13C NMR Spectroscopy 
 Samples were dissolved in deuterated acetonitrile for 13C NMR analysis. 
1H-decoupled 13C NMR spectra were obtained with a Varian 11.75 T system 
(Varian Instruments, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a 5-mm broadband 
probe. Spectra were acquired at 25ºC using a 90º pulse and a 2.5 s acquisition 
time. 4,000-10,000 scans were averaged for each spectrum.  

 4.2.7.3. NMR Analysis

 2H and 13C NMR spectra were analyzed using the curve-fitting routine 
supplied with the NUTS PC-based NMR spectral analysis program (Acorn NMR 
Inc., Fremont CA). In the MAG samples derived from the glucose monomers 
of  hepatic glycogen, 2H-enrichments were determined by comparison with the 
2H natural abundance (0.015%) signals of  the acetone group of  MAG whereas 



	 	 	      Chapter 4 101

in MAG samples from plasma glucose, 2H-enrichments were quantified relative 
to an internal standard of  dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). 13C-enrichments were 
determined relative to the natural abundance C1 singlet (1.11%).

4.2.8. Glucose from HGP and gluconeogenesis contribution 
 After the glucose load, it is assumed that total body glucose represents 
a combination of  glucose absorbed from the load, HGP, and existent glucose 
from before the load (Jin et al. 2003). After providing 2H

2
O, plasma glucose 

derived from HGP has 2H incorporated into position 2 as a result of  exchange 
between hepatic G6P and fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). Hence, the ratio of  2H-
enrichment in position 2 of  glucose (H2) to that of  PW reflects the fractional 
contribution of  HGP to plasma glucose (Eq. 4.1). Note that this contribution 
formally includes glucose molecules that undergo futile cycling between blood 
and liver as a result of  glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activites 
(Katz et al. 1975). 2H-enrichment in position 2 of  glucose was quantified by 
2H NMR analysis of  the MAG derivative of  plama glucose (Figure 4.1). MAG 
samples from animals of  the same group at same time post-load were pooled in 
order to obtain better quality 2H NMR spectra for confident quantification of  
the 2H positional enrichments. 
 Plasma glucose derived from gluconeogenesis has deuterium incorporated 
in position 5 as a result of  exchanges at the level of  the triose phosphate 
precursors. The fraction of  plasma glucose derived from gluconeogenesis can 
thus be determined from the ratio of  2H-enrichment in position 5 of  plasma 
glucose (H5) relative to the plasma water 2H-enrichment (Eq. 4.2). 

Percent of  plasma glucose from HGP = (H2/PW) × 100 (%)                         [Eq. 4.1]

Percent of  plasma glucose from gluconeogenesis = (H5/PW) × 100 (%)        [Eq. 4.2]

O. Seven MAG aliphatic hydrogens derived from plasma glucose are shown and identified 

respectively.

4.2.9. Glucose and “recycled” glucose from the i.p. load     
 The contribution to total glucose from the i.p. load was estimated using 
13C NMR analysis following administration of  [U-13C]glucose. As the glucose 
load was only 9.6 % enriched with [U-13C]glucose, the probability that two [U-
13C]trioses can be recombined to form [U-13C]glucose is very low. Thus, it is 
assumed that all [U-13C]glucose present in plasma glucose originated from the 
load (Jin et al. 2003). In the 13C NMR spectra of  MAG derived from plasma 
glucose, the 13C resonances consist of  singlet signals, mostly derived from 
13C natural-abundance, and the 13C-13C spin-spin coupled multiplets. In the 
carbon 1 resonance, it is possible to resolve the quartet (Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4) 
corresponding to [U-13C]glucose that is quantified relative to the 1.11% natural 
abundance singlet (Figure 4.2).

Figure 4.2. C1 13C NMR signals of  monoacetone glucose (MAG) derived from plasma 
glucose 60 min after the i.p. glucose load (1.5mg/g body weight) in control animals. The singlet 
(S) corresponding to the natural abundance and the isotopomers resultant of  [U-13C]glucose 
(Q1-Q4) and recycled glucose (D1 and D2) are observed. 

 By accounting for the 9.6 % [U-13C]glucose enrichment of  the i.p. glucose 
load it is possible to estimate the contribution of  the i.p. load to plasma glucose 
as follows:

Contribution to glucose from i.p. load = 

[(Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4) / S] × 1.11 / 0.096 (%)                  [Eq. 4.3]

 The doublet signals (D1 and D2) in the 13C NMR carbon 1 multiplet 
due to 13C-13C coupling between carbons 1 and 2 (but not carbon 5) represent 
the sum of  [1,2,3-13C

]pyruvate is the result of  tricarboxylix acids (TCA) cycle exchanges 

and pyruvate recycling fluxes (Jones et al. 1997). The abundance of  these two 
isotopomers, corrected for dilution at the level of  the TCA cycle, provides an 
estimate of  the fraction of  plasma glucose derived from recycling (Perdigoto et 
al. 2003, Sena et al. 2007) as follows:

Contribution of  recycled glucose from i.p. load=

[(D1 + D2) / S] × 1.11 / 0.096 × 1.5 (%)                                [Eq. 4.4]

where 1.5 is a correction factor that accounts for dilution of  the 13C-label at the 
level of  the hepatic TCA cycle (Perdigoto et al. 2003, Sena et al. 2007).

  Previous studies have shown that the glucose entering the system is 
instantaneously mixed in ~16-20% of  the animal body weight, the glucose mixing 
space (mL/kg) (Baker et al. 1959, Raman et al. 1990, McArthur et al. 1999). Using 
Eq. 4.5 is possible to determine the total body glucose considering the total 
glucose space, animals’ body weight and the blood glucose concentration.

Total body glucose = glucose space × [blood glucose] × animal body weight  [Eq. 4.5]

 Thus, the absolute contributions (mmol) of  HGP, gluconeogenesis,  
glucose and “recycled” glucose from the i.p. load to total body glucose are 
derived by multiplying relative percent contributions by total body glucose at 
each time point.
 
4.2.10. Hepatic glycogen synthesis

 Hepatic glycogen content was determined 60 min following the i.p. 
glucose load by analyzing the amount of  glucose after enzymatic hydrolysis of  
hepatic glycogen. Glucose concentrations were assessed enzymatically by the 



	 	 	      Chapter 4 105

glucose oxidase method using a commercial kit (Invitrogen). The percentage 
of  newly synthesized hepatic glycogen after the glucose load can be quantified 
by analyzing the 2H-enrichment in position 2 of  MAG derivatized from hepatic 
glycogen following its enzymatic hydrolysis to glucose. Indirect pathway 
contributions to hepatic glycogen synthesis can be further assessed by calculating 
the ratio of  2H-enrichments in position 5 and 2.

 4.2.11. Statistical analysis

 Data are presented as average ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical 
differences were determined using one-way analysis of  variance (ANOVA) and 
considered to be statistical significant when p &amp;lt;0.05.

4.3. Results

4.3.1. Blood glucose and plasma insulin during an i.p. glucose load 
 Blood glucose and plasma insulin levels attained during the i.p. glucose 
load for the groups studied are shown in Figure 4.3. Blood glucose peaked 15 
min after the glucose load for control animals and decreased gradually thereafter, 
returning to basal levels 60 min after the load. The relatively high blood glucose 
levels attained may be partially attributed to the known effects of  the anesthesia 
(Zuurbier et al. 2008). CsA-treated animals show significant elevated fasting 
hyperglycemia relative to control animals. HF diet and especially CsA treatment 
promoted impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) as compared with healthy animals. 
In addition, there is a trend for decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in 
CsA-treated animals.

 Compared to the 2H
2
O tracer, [U-13C]glucose enrichment of  plasma 

glucose was much slower, peaking at 30 min after the i.p. glucose load (Figure 
4.5). Moreover, the maximum enrichment levels attained were unexpectedly low 
(about one-third of  the load enrichment), given the size of  the glucose load 
(2,632 mmol) relative to the initial total body glucose pool size (442 mmol). The 
observed plasma [U-13C]enrichment levels correspond to a ~37% contribution 
from the i.p. glucose load. Low plasma [U-13C]glucose enrichments could result 
from reduced absorption rate of  the i.p. glucose load or from dilution from 
unlabeled glucose generated via HGP. Previous studies with oral glucose loads 
show that 50% of  plasma glucose in 6-h fasted rats was accounted for by the 
load at 60 minutes after (Smadja et al. 1988) while in 24-h fasted rats, the load 
contribution was 70-80% (Jin et al. 2003). Thus, the reduced contribution of  the 
load glucose in the 6-h compared to 24-h fasting most probably reflects a higher 
initial glucose pool size and/or increased HGP at 6-h vs. 24-h fasting.

4.3.3. Glucose from HGP and gluconeogenesis contribution

 All plasma glucose derived from HGP (gluconeogenesis + glycogenolysis 
+  glucose-G6P cycling) is labeled in position 2 as a result of  F6P-G6P exchange. 
If  HGP accounted for all the plasma glucose, the plasma glucose H2 enrichment 
level would be equal to that of  PW. The glucose contributions from HGP to 
total glucose with time are shown in Figure 4.6. For control animals, HGP 
contributions were relatively constant and significant between 15 and 60 min 
after the i.p. glucose load.
 Gluconeogenesis results in the labeling of  H5 as well as H2 (while 
glycogenolysis and glucose-G6P cycling do not). Hence the fraction of  plasma 
glucose derived from gluconeogenesis is given by H5/PW. If  all plasma glucose 
was derived from gluconeogenesis, then the plasma glucose H5 enrichment level 
would be equal to that of  PW. It would also necessarily mean that all HGP was 
derived from gluconeogenesis (i.e., H5/H2 = 1.0) and that all plasma glucose 
was derived from HGP since H5/H2 = 1.0, therefore H2 = PW (see Figure 
4.1). From 15-60 minutes after the glucose load, gluconeogenesis was found to 
account for a minority (30-45%) of  HGP.

4.3.4. Glucose and “recycled” glucose from the i.p. load

 From the 13C NMR analysis of  plasma glucose 13C-isotopomer levels, 
direct plasma glucose enrichment from the i.p. load, as determined from the 
enrichment of  plasma [U-13C]glucose, reached a peak at 30 min. At this point, 
37% of  total plasma and body glucose was accounted for by direct absorption 
from the load. At 60 min after the glucose load, direct absorption accounted 
for 34% of  the load while HGP accounted for 55% of  plasma glucose. The 
remaining 11% may represent the presence of  a small amount of  unlabeled 
glucose from before the load.
 At 60 min post-load, “recycled” glucose accounted for 107 ± 35 mmol 
of  total glucose and ~89% of  the gluconeogenic HGP component. These data 



	 	 	      Chapter 4 109

suggest that during the i.p. glucose load, glucose recycling via the Cori cycle 
quantitatively accounts for almost all of  the gluconeogenesis contribution 
to HGP. Thus, the glucose recycling fraction provides a good estimate of  
gluconeogenesis in this specific instance and in principle, would allow both 
the absorption and gluconeogenic contributions to plasma glucose levels to be 
determined from a single [U-13C]glucose tracer.

4.3.5.   Effects  of   HF  diet  and  CsA  treatment in postprandial glucose
            metabolism

 Postprandial metabolism of  rats on a HF diet or CsA treatment for 20 
days was further assessed during an i.p. glucose load test using 2H and 13C NMR 
spectroscopy following 2H

2
O and [U-13C]glucose administration. Animals on a 

HF diet presented normal HGP, whereas CsA treated animals showed increased 
HGP and an increased contribution of  the i.p. load to total glucose (Figure 4.7). 
Total body glucose and contributions from “recycled” glucose from load were 
not significantly altered in HF diet-fed and CsA-treated rats.

4.3.6. Hepatic glycogen synthesis

 Hepatic glycogen content was assessed 60 min after the i.p. glucose load 
and found to account for 0.44 ± 0.13 mmol/g of  liver wet weight in control 
animals. Hepatic glycogen content is not significantly altered in animals on a 
HF diet (0.37 ± 0.19 mmol/g liver wet weight) and CsA treatment (0.39 ± 0.09 
mmol/g liver wet weight). Moreover, hepatic glycogen content was previously 
determined in healthy animals after 6-h fasting and found to account for 0.35 ± 
0.10 mmol/g liver wet weight (Chapter 2). Thus, in 6-h fasted animals, hepatic 
glycogen content is not significantly altered after a glucose load which is in 
agreement with earlier studies (Smadja et al. 1988). Moreover, hepatic glycogen 
synthesis was quantified by measuring the incorporation of  deuterium in hepatic 
glycogen and found to account only for ~2.5 % of  total hepatic glycogen  in 
control animals (~1 mmol/g liver during 60 min, data not shown). In these rats, 
indirect pathway contributed for  ~64% of  hepatic glycogen synthesis (data not 
shown).

h fasted control rats was found to be inhibited by 30% at 60 min following an 
oral glucose load of  2.4 mg/g body weight (Smadja et al. 1988), whereas in 24-h 
fasted rats HGP was not suppressed as a result of  a glucose load (Smadja et al. 
1990, Niewoehner et al. 1984). At 24 hours of  fasting, the continuation of  HGP 
in the presence of  a glucose load may be an appropriate response to restore 
depleted carbohydrate stores in peripheral tissues. 
 To the extent that HGP as measured by the deuterated water method  
used in here includes contributions from glucose-G6P futile cycling, the true 
rates of  HGP are overestimated. In hepatocytes, it was shown that futile cycling 
between glucose and G6P is extensive when glycogen content is elevated (i.e., 
fed animals) and relatively low in cells from starved rats (Katz et al. 1975). 
Considering that 6-h fasted animals demonstrated substantial G6Pase activity 
(as seen by the substantial contribution of  HGP to whole body glucose) in the 
face of  a large glucose load (which should stimulate glucokinase as a result of  
increased insulin levels), glucose-G6P cycling could be very active under these 
conditions and may contribute substantially to the estimated HGP. 
 Gluconeogenesis contribution to total glucose after a glucose load was 
determined by measuring the ratio of  H5 to PW following administration of  2H

2
O 

and found to account for 30-45% of  total glucose production. Previously, in 6-h 
fasted rats, gluconeogenesis was found to account for ~54% of  HGP (Chapter 
2). The observation that HGP sources are not drastically altered as a result of  a 
glucose load is in agreement with previous studies where gluconeogenesis was 
found to account for ~80% of  HGP in 24-h fasted rats, before (Jin et al. 2004) 
and after a glucose load (Jin et al. 2003). Moreover, the glucose-G6P cycling 
activity may also explain the relatively low gluconeogenic contribution (30-45%) 
to HGP that was measured. 
 Given the abundance of  hepatic glycogen after 6 hours of  fasting (~0.35 
mmol/g liver wet weight) (Chapter 2) contributions from glycogenolysis to HGP 
cannot be ruled out. However, the fact that hepatic glycogen levels at 60 minutes 



	 	 	      Chapter 4 113

post-load were essentially equal to baseline levels indicates that there was no 
net loss or gain of  hepatic glycogen as a result of  the glucose load. In addition, 
2H incorporation into newly synthesized hepatic glycogen was residual implying 
that after a glucose load, hepatic glycogen synthesis is negligible in 6-h fasted 
rats. This is in agreement with a study by Smadja et al., where liver glycogen 
concentration remained unchanged during the glucose load despite a normal 
capacity for glycogen synthesis (Smadja et al. 1988). 
 The contribution of  plasma glucose from the i.p. load as estimated using 
13C NMR analysis following administration of  [U-13C]glucose was found to 
contribute ~34% for total glucose, 60 minutes after the glucose load. The reduced 
contribution of  the load glucose in 6-h fasted rats most probably reflects a high 
initial glucose pool size and/or increased HGP. “Recycled” glucose from Cori 
cycle contribution was determined and found to be similar to the gluconeogenesis 
contribution to total glucose. Thus, lactate from “recycled” glucose through 
Cori cycle in peripheral tissues is probably the major gluconeogenic substrate 
following a glucose load (Niewoehner et al. 1984). The glucose recycling fraction 
provides a good estimate of  gluconeogenesis and in principle allows both the 
absorption and gluconeogenic contributions to plasma glucose levels to be 
determined from a single [U-13C]glucose tracer. 
 Finally, sources of  total glucose after an i.p. glucose load were evaluated 
in animals on a HF diet for 20 days and with ongoing CsA treatment. Both 
groups of  animals showed IGT relative to controls. HF diet did not promote 
impaired contribution from HGP and insulin secretion by pancreatic b-cells was 
not affected. Thus, the IGT of  HF-fed animals can be attributed to decreased 
whole body glucose disposal secondary to peripheral insulin resistance rather than 
impaired HGP suppression. With CsA-treated animals the observed IGT was 
associated with a higher HGP contribution to plasma glucose levels, suggesting 
that in this model impaired HGP suppression was a significant component of  
IGT.

5.1. Introduction

	 Hepatic	glycogen	metabolism	is	regulated	by	substrate	and	hormonal	
availability	according	to	the	nutritional	conditions.	In	the	fasting	state,	when	
plasma	glucose	levels	are	low,	glycogen	phosphorylase	is	activated	and	glycogen	
is	converted	to	glucose	via	glucose-1-phosphate	(G1P)	and	glucose-6-phosphate	
(G6P).	The	released	glucose	contributes	substantially	to	hepatic	and	endogenous	
glucose	production	 (EGP).	Following	 ingestion	of	a	meal	and	carbohydrate	
absorption,	plasma	glucose	levels	increase	and	promote	the	secretion	of	insulin	
by	pancreatic	b-cells.	Insulin	enhances	glycogen	synthesis	from	hepatic	G6P	
primarily	by	activating	glycogen	synthase	and	inhibiting	glycogen	phosphorylase.	
The	 G6P	 used	 for	 hepatic	 glycogen	 synthesis	 is	 derived	 from	 two	 distinct	
pathways:	direct	conversion	from	glucose	via glucokinase and indirect synthesis 
involving	3-carbon	precursors	(Newgard et al. 1983,	Newgard	et al. 1984) (Figure 
5.1).	The	3-carbon	sources	for	the	indirect	pathway	may	originate	from	hepatic	
glycolysis	of	glucose	as	well	as	from	non-glucose	(gluconeogenic)	precursors	such	
as	lactate,	amino	acids	and	glycerol.	Direct	and	indirect	pathway	contributions	
to	hepatic	glycogen	synthesis	can	be	examined	following	ingestion	of	a	tracer	
and	analysis	of	plasma	glucose	and	hepatic	uridine	diphosphate-glucose	(UDP-
glucose) enrichments. 
	 In	humans,	when	a	xenobiotic	agent	(i.e.,	acetaminophen	or	peppermint	
oil)	is	provided,	the	enrichment	distributions	of	hepatic	UDP-glucose	are	also	
reflected	in	the	respective	urinary	glucuronide	conjugate	(i.e.,	acetominophen	
or menthol glucuronide (Hellerstein et al. 1986,	Landau	et al. 1991,	Ribeiro	et al. 
2005,	Mendes et al. 2006))	since	the	glucose	moiety	of	UDP-glucose	is	converted	
to	glucuronide	by	a	single	dedicated	pathway.	To	date,	contributions	of	direct	
and	indirect	pathways	to	hepatic	glycogen	synthesis	have	been	estimated	using	
[1-13C]glucose	or	deuterated	water	(2H

2
O)	in	conjunction	with	acetaminophen.	

With	these	methods,	the	indirect	pathway	was	found	to	contribute	substantially	



120 Chapter 5

(30-50	%)	to	hepatic	glycogen	synthesis	in	healthy	subjects	following	a	mixed	
meal (Taylor et al. 1996,	Bischof	et al.	2002,	Jones	et al. 2006) or a glucose load 
(Napoli et al. 1992,	Petersen	et al. 2001).

 The	oral	glucose	tolerance	test	(OGTT)	is	a	widely	used	test	for	whole

Surprisingly,	given	the	pivotal	role	of	the	liver	in	splanchnic	glucose	metabolism,	
there	have	been	few	studies	to	date	on	the	role	and	mechanism	of	hepatic	glucose	
disposal	in	this	setting.	Therefore,	the	goal	of	this	study	was	to	evaluate	direct	
and	 indirect	pathway	 contributions	 to	hepatic	 glycogen	 synthesis	 in	healthy	
volunteers	during	an	OGTT.	Direct	and	indirect	pathway	contributions	were	
estimated	by	carbon	13	(13C)	Nuclear	Magnetic	Resonance	(NMR)	analysis	of	
plasma	glucose	and	urinary	menthol	glucuronide	excess	enrichments	following	
ingestion	of	peppermint	oil	and	an	oral	glucose	 load	enriched	with	a	stable	
isotope	tracer.	Compared	to	the	rather	laborious	purification	and	derivatization

1987,	Burgess et al. 2003),	menthol	glucuronide	can	be	directly	analyzed	by	NMR	
spectroscopy	after	a	simple	isolation	protocol	(Ribeiro et al.	2005,	Mendes	et al. 
2006). 
	 A	variety	of	carbon	and	hydrogen	tracers	can	be	used	to	follow	the	
metabolism	of	glucose	to	hepatic	UDP-glucose	(Napoli	et al.	1992,	Jones	et al. 
2006),	with	[1-13C]glucose	being	the	most	widely	used	at	this	time	(Hwang et al. 
1995,	Petersen	et al. 2001).	The	main	disadvantages	of	[1-13C]glucose	are	that:	
1)	a	relatively	large	amount	(~10	grams)	is	required	to	generate	sufficient	excess	
enrichment	of	the	UDP-glucose	and	glucuronide	pools	so	that	glucuronide	13C-
enrichment	can	be	reliably	quantified	above	the	background	1.11%	13C-enrichment	
level	and	2)	the	effects	of	glucose	recycling	on	glucose	and	glucuronide	13C-
enrichments	have	to	be	accounted	for	since	[1-13C]glucose	metabolism	via the 
Cori	cycle	can	produce	[1-13C]glucuronide	and	regenerate	[1-13C]glucose. 
	 Therefore,	the	use	of	two	tracers	that	effectively	eliminate	background	
effects	and	are	non-recyclable	were	focused	in	here.	With	the	first	tracer,	[U-
13C]glucose,	the	background	13C-contribution	becomes	negligible	due	to	the	tiny	
probability	(0.0116)	of	a	naturally-occurring	glucose	molecule	containing	six	13C-
atoms.	The	[U-13C]glucose	precursor	and	[U-13C]glucuronide product generate 
resolvable	signals	in	the	13C	spectrum	allowing	direct	quantification	by	13C NMR 
(Hwang et al. 1995,	Mendes	et al.	2006)	and	whole	body	glucose	recycling	does	not	
regenerate	significant	levels	of	[U-13C]glucose.	Moreover,	this	tracer	is	already	
widely	used	in	plasma	kinetic	studies	of	glucose	disposal	and	is	less	expensive	
than	[1-13C]glucose.	The	second	tracer,	[U-2H

7
]glucose,	has	the	advantage	of	a	

low	background	level	of	deuterium	(2H)	(0.015%).	Since	some	of	the	deuterium	
labels	are	removed	during	the	conversion	of	[U-2H

7
]glucose	to	glucuronide,	each	

2H-enrichment	site	has	to	be	independently	monitored	during	this	metabolic	
sequence.	This	can	be	achieved	by	 2H NMR as the 2H-enrichments	of	both	
glucose	(in	the	form	of	monoacetone	glucose	(MAG))	and	glucuronide	are	fully	
resolved	in	their	respective	2H NMR spectra. The 2H-enrichment	in	position	3	



122 Chapter 5

can	be	considered	to	be	non-recyclable	since	it	is	quantitatively	removed	during	
glycolysis.	Finally,	since	the	presence	of	[U-2H

7
]glucose	does	not	interfere	with	

the	NMR	analysis	of	[U-13C]glucose	metabolism	or vice versa,	enrichment	from	
both	tracers	can	be	analyzed	from	a	common	blood	or	urine	sample	and	therefore	
studied	in	the	same	experiment.

5.2.5. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy

 5.2.5.1. 13C NMR spectroscopy

 Samples	were	dissolved	in	deuterated	acetonitrile	for	13C NMR analysis. 
Proton (1H)-decoupled	13C	NMR	spectra	were	obtained	using	a	Varian	14.1	Tesla	
(T)	system	(Varian	Instruments,	Palo	Alto,	CA,	USA).	Spectra	were	acquired	at	
25ºC using a 90º pulse and a 2.5 s acquisition time.

 5.2.5.2. 2H NMR spectroscopy

 2H	NMR	spectra	were	acquired	with	a	Varian	14.1	T	spectrometer	(Varian	
Instruments,	Palo	Alto,	CA,	USA).	Samples	were	dissolved	in	acetonitrile	and	
shimming	was	performed	on	selected	1H resonances. 1H-decoupled	2H NMR 
spectra	were	acquired	without	field-frequency	lock	at	50ºC	using	a	90º	pulse,	a	
1.6	second	acquisition	time	with	a	pulse	delay	(D

conditions	resulted	in	the	partial	saturation	of	the	internal	2H-enrichment	pyrazine

under	non-saturating	conditions	(D

=5 and 15 seconds). By comparing the ratio 

of	pyrazine	to	analyte	signals	under	both	acquisition	conditions,	a	correction	
factor	for	partial	saturation	was	obtained.	

 5.2.5.3. NMR Analysis

 NMR	spectra	were	 analyzed	using	 the	 curve-fitting	 routine	 supplied	
with	the	NUTS	PC-based	NMR	spectral	analysis	program	(Acorn	NMR	Inc.,	
Fremont CA). 13C-enrichments	were	quantified	relative	to	the	natural abundance	
signals	(1.11%)	whereas	2H-enrichments	were	determined	by	comparison	to	an	
internal	pyrazine	 2H-enrichment	standard	after	correction	for	relaxation	time

5.2.6. Quantification  of   direct  and  indirect  pathway contributions to  
          glycogen synthesis with [U-13C]glucose and [U-2H7]glucose 
 After	 ingestion	 of	 [U-13C]glucose,	 [U-13C]glucuronide	 is	 formed	 by	
direct	pathway	whereas	by	indirect	pathway,	the	[U-13C]glucose	carbon	skeleton

hence,	UDP-glucose	or	glucuronide	that	is	subsequently	synthesized	via indirect

   2H	NMR	analysis	of	glucose	enrichment	from	[U-2H
7
]glucose present 

in	the	load	revealed	that	the	plasma	glucose	H3	enrichment	was	~80%	that	of	
the	precursor	oral	glucose	load	indicating	that	the	majority	of	plasma	glucose	
was	derived	from	the	load	and	resembling	the	enrichment	pattern	observed	with	
[U-13C]glucose	(Figure	5.6	).	While	the	dilution	of	both	tracers	after	ingestion	
was	 relatively	 small,	 the	 extent	 of	 [U-2H

7
]glucose	 dilution	 was	 slightly,	 but	

systematically	higher	compared	to	[U-13C]glucose.	This	is	most	likely	the	result	of	
the	different	methodologies	used	to	determine	the	13C and 2H-enrichment	levels	
from	the	NMR	spectra.	As	shown	in	Table	5.2,	glucuronide	H3	enrichment	was	
only	about	half	that	of	plasma	glucose,	consistent	with	a	significant	amount	of	
dilution	by	unlabeled	hexoses	derived	via	indirect	pathway	flux.	From	analysis	of	
the glucose and glucuronide H3 enrichment ratios (Eqs. 5.3 and 5.4) the indirect 
pathway	was	estimated	to	contribute	about	half	of	the	total	glycogen	synthesis	
flux.	This	estimate	tended	to	be	lower	and	closer	to	literature	values	of	30-50%	
(Napoli et al. 1992,	Petersen	et al.	2001)	compared	to	the	64%	derived	from	
[U-13C]glucose.	Due	to	the	 large	 inter-individual	variations	 in	direct	pathway	
estimates	obtained	with	both	methods,	the	differences	in	estimates	were	not	
statistically	significant	for	this	group	of	subjects.							
 While the 2H-enrichment	 levels	 of	 plasma	 glucose	 were	 relatively	
constant	across	all	seven	positions,	enrichment	of	the	glucuronide	hydrogens 
showed	marked	variations	in	2H-enrichment	levels.	During	the	conversion	of	
UDP-glucose	to	glucuronide,	the	position	6	hydrogens	are	removed	through	
the	oxidation	of	carbon	6.	Removal	of	2H	from	the	remaining	positions	can	
be	attributed	to	hexose	phosphate	exchanges	that	occur	during	the	conversion	
of	glucose	to	UDP-glucose.	There	are	three	main	exchange	reactions	that	can	
remove	 2H	during	direct	pathway	conversion	of	[U-2H

7
]glucose to glycogen.    

Firstly,	G6P-F6P	exchange	catalyzed	by	G6P-isomerase	results	in	the	loss	of	2H 
at	position	2	(Landau	et al. 1991). Secondly,	G6P-F6P-	mannose-6-phosphate	
(M6P)	exchange	catalyzed	by	G6P	and	M6P-isomerases	results	in	the	loss	of	2H 



132 Chapter 5

at position 1 (Chandramouli et al. 1999),	and	thirdly,	exchange	of	F6P	carbons	
4,	5	and	6	with	those	of	glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate	via TA results in the loss 
of	2H	at	positions	4,	5	and	6	(Jones	et al. 2008).	Therefore,	with	the	exception	
of	position	3,	these	exchanges	deplete	2H	from	all	other	positions	of	G6P	and	
the	extent	of	each	exchange	activity	can	be	estimated	by	comparing	the	 2H-
enrichment	levels	of	the	exchangeable	hydrogen	with	that	of	position	3.

5.4. Discussion

5.4.1. Sources of  hepatic glycogen synthesis during  OGTT:  comparison 
          with previously published studies

  Direct	and	indirect	pathway	contributions	to	hepatic	glycogen	synthesis	
were	evaluated	during	an	OGTT	in	healthy	subjects	following	ingestion	of	two	
different	tracers	incorporated	in	the	load,	[U-13C]glucose	and	[U-2H

7
]glucose,	

and	peppermint	oil	for	the	chemical	biopsy	of	hepatic	UDP-glucose	as	urinary	
menthol	 glucuronide.	 Direct	 and	 indirect	 pathway	 contributions	 were	 then	
estimated	from	the	dilution	of	the	enrichment	between	plasma	glucose	and	UDP-
glucose.	Various	exchange	reactions	at	the	level	of	hepatic	G6P	can	modify	the	
enrichment	of	glucuronide	independently	of	direct	and	indirect	pathway	fluxes	
and	therefore	may	significantly	add	to	the	uncertainty	of	the	measurement.	Since	
these	exchanges	involve	specific	G6P	carbons	and/or	hydrogens,	their	effects	
can	in	principle	be	corrected	for,	or	even	avoided,	by	choosing	the	appropriate	
labeled	glucose	precursor.	To	unravel	the	extent	and	effects	of	these	exchanges,	
the	application	of	2H	NMR	to	monitor	the	conversion	of	[U-2H

7
]glucose to 

glucuronide	represents	a	significant	advance	since	the	fate	of	each	individual	
deuterium	label	of	glucose	can	be	monitored	in	a	single	measurement.					
 Since	 the	 position	 3	 deuterium	 of	 glucose	 is	 the	 only	 label	 that	 is	
unaffected	by	exchange	reactions	involving	hepatic	hexose	phosphates,	direct	
and	indirect	pathway	contributions	were	determined	through	the	dilution	of

2H-enrichment	 in	 this	 position	 during	 the	 conversion	 of	 [U-2H
7
]glucose to 

glucuronide.	This	analysis	revealed	an	indirect	pathway	contribution	of	~50%,	
an	unexpectedly	high	contribution	considering	that	the	preceding	“meal”	was	
100%	glucose.	
	 Previously,	 Petersen	 et al.	 reported	 an	 indirect	 pathway	 contribution	
of	 36-38%	 to	 glycogen	 synthesis	 during	 an	 OGTT	 using	 [1-13C]glucose 
and acetaminophen (Petersen et al. 2001).	 Apart	 from	 methodological	
differences,	including		the		different		analysis		technique		used	(i.e.	NMR vs. 
Gas-Chromatography-Mass	 Spectrometry	 (GC-MS),	 the	 different	 biopsy	
agent	used	(i.e.,	peppermint	oil	vs. acetominophen),	use	of	a	different	tracer	
(i.e.,	[U-2H

7
]glucose	and	[U-13C[glucose	vs. [1-13C]glucose),	the	glucose	load	was	

significantly	different	in	both	studies	(i.e.,	75	g	vs.	98	g).	Moreover,	the	plasma	
glucose	levels	attained	after	the	glucose	load	in	the	study	by	Petersen	et al. are 
relatively	lower	than	the	ones	reported	in	here	(~7.5	mM	at	30	min	vs. 8.4 mM 
at	60	min)	probably	reflecting	healthier	controls.	The	relative	contributions	of	
direct	and	indirect	pathways	to	hepatic	glycogen	synthesis	are	dependent	on	
plasma	glucose	concentrations	and	emphasize	the	predominance	of	the	indirect	
pathway	of	glycogen	synthesis	for	higher	values	of	plasma	glucose	(Lang	 et 
al.	1986).	Thus,	it	is	speculated	that	the	different	estimated	values	for	indirect	
pathway	contribution	are	probably	due	to	lower	plasma	glucose	levels	attained	
by	the	subjects	used	by	Petersen	et al.. 
	 In	any	event,	given	that	the	liver	only	extracts	~20%	of	splanchnic	glucose	
while	the	majority	is	taken	up	and	metabolized	by	peripheral	tissues,	notably	
skeletal	muscle,	it	is	hypothesized	that	the	Cori	cycle	is	the	major	contributor	to	
indirect	pathway	flux	following	OGTT,	as	a	result	of	peripheral	tissue	glycolysis	
of	the	majority	(~80%)	of	the	glucose	 load.	This	activity	 is	consistent	with	
the	reported	increase	of	blood	lactate	concentrations	during	OGTT	in	healthy	
subjects	(Prando	et al. 1988).

5.4.2.  Carbon  exchanges  during  the  direct  pathway  metabolism  of  
          glucose  to  glycogen  and  their  effect  on  direct  and  indirect 
            pathway estimates using [U-13C]glucose  
 [U-13C]glucose	 is	 a	 potentially	 highly	 informative	 tracer	 of	 hepatic	
metabolism	since	unlike	hydrogen	tracers,	the	13C-label	can	be	followed	through	
the	glycolytic	pathway	and	into	the	acetyl-CoA	and	tricarboxylic	acids	(TCA)	
cycle	pools.	In	humans,	these	can	be	noninvasively	interrogated	alongside	the	
hepatic	UDP-glucose	pool	by	providing	phenylacetate	or	phenylbutyrate	to	bind	
and sample hepatic glutamine as urinary phenyalcetylglutamine (PAGN) (Cline 
et al.	1994).	While	beyond	the	scope	of	this	Thesis,	13C	NMR	analysis	of	PAGN	
obtained	from	these	experiments	revealed	measurable	levels	of	13C-enrichment	
and	therefore	the	potential	for	interrogating	hepatic	acetyl-CoA	and	TCA	cycle	
fluxes	and	integrating	this	information	with	that	of	hepatic	glycogen	synthesis	
(data	not	shown).								
	 Estimates	of	 indirect	pathway	contribution	derived	from	the	analysis	
of	[U-13C]glucose	were	found	to	be	systematically	higher	compared	to	those	
derived	 from	the	analysis	of	 [3-2H]glucose	dilution	 following	 its	 conversion	
to	 [3-2H]glucuronide.	 This	 difference	 may	 in	 part	 be	 accounted	 for	 by	 TA	
exchange.	Since	TA	exchange	involves	the	transfer	of	hexose	carbon	as	well	
as	hydrogen	moieties,	TA	activity	can	modify	the	enrichment	of	[U-13C]hexose	
phosphates	 and	UDP-glucose	 independently	of	direct	 and	 indirect	pathway

extent	that	TA	exchange	is	active,	the	enrichment	level	of	the	[U-13C]glucuronide 
product	 is	reduced	hence	the	direct	pathway	contribution	is	underestimated,	
while	the	indirect	pathway	fraction	is	correspondingly	overestimated.	From	the 
2H-enrichment	analyses,	it	was	estimated	that	21%	±	10%	of	direct	pathway	
flux	participated	in	TA	exchange.	Therefore,	as	a	result	of	TA	exchange	activity,	
the	direct	pathway	contribution	reported	by	[U-13C]glucose	is	underestimated	by

~20%	while	the	indirect	pathway	contribution	is	correspondingly	overestimated.	
After	correcting	for	this	level	of	TA	exchange,	(Eqs.	5.6	and	5.7)	direct	pathway	
estimates	of	44%	±	14%	and	indirect	pathway	contributions	of	56%	±	14%	
were	obtained	from	the	[U-13C]glucose	tracer	analysis.	These	values	correlate	
well	with	the	50%	±	14%	estimate	obtained	from	the	[3-2H]glucose/glucuronide	
analysis.  
	 In	summary,	novel	13C and 2H	glucose	tracers	were	used	to	determine	
direct	and	indirect	pathway	contributions	to	hepatic	glycogen	synthesis	during	
OGTT	by	NMR	analysis	of	plasma	glucose	and	urinary	glucuronide	enrichments.	
Exchanges	of	both	carbon	and	hydrogen	moieties	during	the	direct	pathway

glucuronide	from	any	glucose	tracer	that	is	enriched	in	carbons	4,	5	and	6	(including	
[U-13C]glucose)	will	be	modified	by	TA	exchange	in	addition	to	direct	and	indirect	
pathway	fluxes.	During	OGTT,	~20	%	of	direct	pathway	flux	was	involved	in	
this	exchange	hence	the	values	derived	from	the	[U-13C]glucose tracer resulted 
in	underestimates	of	the	direct	pathway	contribution.	For	glucose	enriched	with	
2H,	the	position	3	 label	 is	unaffected	by	hexose	phosphate	exchanges	hence	
direct	pathway	estimates	based	on	[3-2H]glucose/glucuronide	enrichment	ratios	
are	insensitive	to	TA	exchange	and	therefore	reflect	true	direct/indirect	pathway	
fluxes.	As	conclusions,	the	results	presented	in	here	demonstrate	that	during	an	
OGTT	in	healthy	humans,	half	of	hepatic	glycogen	synthesis	is	derived	from	
3-carbon	precursors	rather	than	directly	from	the	glucose	load.

6.1. Introduction

The high fat (HF) level of  the typical western style diet is considered to 
be an important factor in the development of  type 2 diabetes (T2D) (McGarry 
2001, Unger and Zhou 2001, Unger and Orci 2001). In this setting, there is an 
initial phase often referred to as the “prediabetic state” which is characterized 
by weight gain, an increase in the body fat fraction and the development of  
glucose intolerance. In addition to an overall gain in body fat, there is increased 
deposition of  ectopic triglycerides, particularly in liver and skeletal muscle. Since 
these lipid pools may play a key role in the development of  insulin resistance (IR) 
at an early and possibly reversible stage of  T2D, there is an increased interest 
in the study of  ectopic lipid dynamics both in order to better understand the 
pathogenesis of  IR and also as a clinical marker for identifying people that may 
be at an elevated risk of  developing T2D. There is particular focus on the study 
of  ectopic hepatic triglycerides (HTG) as they are highly sensitive to dietary fat 
intake. Moreover,  elevated HTG is tightly associated with glucose intolerance 
and decreased insulin sensitivity (Ryysi et al. 2000, Anderwald et al. 2002). 
Elevated HTG levels are prevalent in patients with established T2D (Ryysi et 
al. 2000, Anderwald et al. 2002, Mayerson et al. 2002, Kelley et al. 2003, Petersen 
et al. 2005), in animal models of  T2D and are associated with features of  the 
metabolic syndrome (Kotronen et al. 2008). 

Rodent models are important for understanding the relationship between 
HTG and the development of  IR and glucose intolerance in the “prediabetic” 
state. These models enable the design of  prospective diet studies on HTG 
levels with the effects being observed within a few days or weeks. Non-diabetic 
healthy rats placed on a HF diet accumulate HTG (Samuel et al. 2004,  Gauthier 
et al. 2006) and this is associated with significantly impaired insulin action, 
reduced whole body glucose disposal rates and hepatic IR (Kraegen et al. 1986, 
Storlien et al. 1986, Kraegen et al. 1991, Oakes et al. 1997a, Oakes et al. 1997b). 



144 Chapter 6

However, the time-scale and reversibility of  HTG levels induced by HF diet 
and its associated effects on glucose homeostasis are not as well defined in rats 
compared to humans. This is because noninvasive methods such as Magnetic 
Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)/Imaging (MRI) that have been developed and 
applied for monitoring longitudinal changes of  human HTG levels have not 
yet been widely applied in rats. Localized proton (1H) MRS is a noninvasive 
technique that has been shown to be a precise tool for quantification of  HTG 
content (Szczepaniak et al. 1999, Szczepaniak et al. 2005, Thomas et al. 2005). 
With appropriate high-field Magnetic Resonance (MR) systems (7 Tesla (T) or 
above) was possible the quantification of  HTG in mice (Garbow et al. 2004) and 
in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat, a model of  T2D (Kuhlmann et al. 2003). 
Additionally, this measurement is well suited for longitudinal measurements of  
HTG in a single animal.

 HTG can be derived from extra-hepatic fatty acids that are taken up 
and esterified to triglycerides following hepatic uptake or can also be formed 
in situ via hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) of  fatty acids from acetyl-CoA. 
Given the capacity of  the liver to synthesize, import and export triglycerides, 
the accumulation of  HTG may arise through an imbalance between triglyceride 
import and export and/or imbalance between triglyceride synthesis and utilization. 
In this study, total HTG were quantified by in vivo localized proton (1H) MRS 
measurement and the lipogenic and non-lipogenic contributions resolved by 
integrating the MRS measurement with a novel and simple measurement of  
DNL by ex vivo deuterium (2H) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis of  
HTG 2H-enrichment from 2H-enriched body water. This approach was applied 
to study the effects of  altering dietary fat content on both HTG levels and 
sources in healthy male Sprague Dawley rats.

6.2. Materials and methods

6.2.1. Experimental design

 Male Sprague-Dawley rats (180-220 g) were housed in a room on a 12-h 
light-dark cycle (08:00-20:00 h light) under constant temperature (22-25 ºC) and 
with ad libitum access to food and water. Animals were divided in three distinct 
study groups. In study 1, animals were studied during 20 days and divided in two 
different subgroups fed either with a HF diet (n=5) containing 45% of  calories 
from fat, 35% from carbohydrate and 20% derived from protein (E15744-34, 
SSNIFF, Specialdiäten GmbH)® or with a standard chow (SC) diet (2.7% fat, 60% 
carbohydrate and 16% protein) (n=6). On day 8 and 15, the two subgroups were 
assessed in terms of  HTG content and on the last day of  experiment blood was 
withdrawn from 6-h fasted animals for determination of  blood glycemia, plasma 
free fatty acids (FFA) and triglyceride content. These animals were challenged 
by a glucose tolerance test consisting of  an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of  
glucose (1.5 mg glucose/g of  body weight) and blood glycemia was assessed 
during 60 min after the glucose load, in pre-determined intervals. Blood glucose 
concentration was measured with a standard glucometer whereas plasma FFA 
and triglyceride levels were assessed using biochemical assay kits commercially 
available from Wako Chemicals GmbH and Sigma, respectively.
 In study 2, a group of  animals (n=5) was maintained during 35 days on 
HF diet feeding, and on the last day assayed for HTG content by 1H MRS and 
compared to a group of  animals fed with a SC diet (n=4). On the afternoon of  
day 35, animals were given an i.p. injection of  8 mL of  99.9% deuterated water 
(2H

2
O) (Sigma-Aldrich) in physiological saline. At this point, the drinking water 

was also enriched with 3% 2H
2
O to maintain constant body water enrichment until 

the end of  the study. On day 37, animals were sacrificed at 14:00 h (24-h clock), 
livers were collected and freeze-clamped for lipid analysis, blood withdrawn and 
immediately centrifuged for plasma separation. Plasma was quickly stored at 



146 Chapter 6

-80ºC. 6-h fasting plasma glucose and insulin were also measured. Insulin was 
measured using an ELISA assay from Linco Research.
 In study 3, Five rats were maintained on a HF diet during 8 days and 
afterwards switched back to a SC diet. On day 1, 8 and 15 of  experiment, liver 
1H MRS was performed to assess HTG levels in each animal. 

6.2.2. 1H Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy (MRI/MRS) 

 In vivo MRI and 1H MRS studies were performed on a 7 T Bruker 
Pharmascan system using a whole body coil for radiofrequency transmitting 
and signal receiving. Animals were placed in their prone position, kept at 37ºC 
and anesthetized with isoflurane anesthetic and maintained under 1.0-1.5% 
isoflurane-oxygen (v/v) during the imaging and spectroscopy experiments. 
Transverse images of  the liver were used to ensure accurate positioning of  
the cubic voxel size of  5 mm in the region of  interest (ROI) of  liver (Figure 
6.1). Single-voxel volume-localized 1H MR spectra were obtained using a point-
resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence (repetition time, TR=1000 ms and 
echo time, TE=28 ms) without water saturation and with 128 average scans 
(Kuhlmann et al. 2003).

 Spectra were analyzed using the NMR data processing program, 
MestreC (Mestrelab Research S.L., Spain), where peak areas for all resonances 
were obtained and the lipid resonance corresponding to the methylene group, 
(CH

2
)

n
, arising from aliphatic fatty acid chains of  triglycerides was quantified with 

reference to the water resonance (Kuhlmann et al. 2003, Garbow et al. 2004). 
 
6.2.3. Liver triglyceride extraction protocol

 Hepatic lipids from freeze-clamped livers were separated by a Folch 
extraction (Folch et al. 1957) adding 20 mL of  a chloroform/ethanol solution 2/1 
(v/v) for each gram of  liver powder under 15 min stirring at room temperature. 
After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and diluted in NaCl (0.9%) 
in 5/1 (v/V) with vigorous agitation. Finally, after another centrifugation, the 
lower lipid-containing phase was collected, evaporated to dryness and dissolved 
in chloroform with pyrazine as an internal standard for NMR analysis.
 
6.2.4. 1H and 2H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis

 1H and 2H NMR spectra were acquired at 11.75 T with a Varian 
spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm broadband “switchable” probe with z-
gradient (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Proton-decoupled 2H NMR spectra were 
acquired without field-frequency lock at 25ºC using a 90º pulse, a 2.0 second 
acquisition time and a 2.0 second pulse delay. 2H-enrichment of  the aggregate 
triglyceride methyl hydrogens, CH

3
, was quantified by comparing the composite 

HTG methyl 2H-signal with that of  an internal pyrazine deuterated standard. 
The fraction of  HTG derived from DNL was estimated as HTG 2H-methyl/
body water 2H-enrichment. 2H body water enrichment was determined in each 
plasma sample using 2H NMR spectroscopy (Jones et al. 2001).

6.2.5.     Estimating    hepatic    triglyceride    synthesis    from    de     novo  
              lipogenesis    by     the    analysis    of    acyl    methyl    hydrogen 
                         2H-enrichment from 2H-enriched body water

 During DNL, the methyl hydrogens of  the acyl moiety are directly 
derived from those of  acetyl-CoA and do not participate in the desaturation 
and chain elongation reactions that occur during lipogenesis. To our knowledge, 
there have been no direct measurements of  acetyl-CoA enrichment from 2H-
enriched body water. Assuming that pyruvate is the main source of  lipogenic 
acetyl-CoA and given that the exchange of  pyruvate methyl protons with those 
of  water is 80-95% complete (Rognstad et al. 1974, Kuwajima et al. 1986), the 
enrichment of  body water is a good approximation for that of  the immediate 
acetyl-CoA precursor. Assuming that body water enrichment is equal to that of  
the acetyl-CoA precursor, the fraction of  triglyceride acyl groups derived from 
DNL (HTG lipogenic fraction) is simply the triglyceride enrichment divided by 
body water enrichment, given by Eq. 6.1. 

 In the 2H NMR spectrum, methyl signals from palmitoyl (C16) and 
stearoyl (C18) chains co-resonate (Zhang et al. 2006) hence the NMR measurement 
reports the methyl enrichment from both C16 and C18 acyl moieties. A 
significant portion of  stearyl acyl units are derived by an independent chain 
elongation reaction of  palmitoyl-CoA (Bassilian et al. 2002). However, since the 
chain is elongated at the carboxyl end of  the acyl moiety, the methyl hydrogens 
of  these elongated acyl moieties still represent the original lipogenic C16 moiety. 
Therefore, the 2H-enrichment level represents the total population of  acyl units 
(C16 plus C18) derived from lipogenesis.

6.3. Results 

6.3.1. Study groups characteristics

 Table 6.1 shows the average weight gain for the 20 and 35 day study 
groups (study 1 and 2) in addition to fasting blood glucose, plasma insulin, FFA 
and triglyceride levels. HF diet-fed animals initially show an increased weight gain 
compared to the controls but after 35 days of  HF diet, these animals showed a 
decreased average weight gain relative to animals on a SC diet for the same time 
period. HF diet was previously shown to reduce appetite in rodents (Liu et al. 
2005), and therefore it can be speculated that the lower net weight gain in HF 
diet-fed animals was likely due to diminished food intake. Fasting blood glucose, 
plasma insulin, FFA and triglyceride concentrations were not significantly 
modified in animals placed on the HF diet compared to those maintained on 
SC.

 Plasma glucose disposal following a glucose challenge was less efficient 
in HF diet fed animals compared to their SC counterparts as shown in Figure

6.3.3. Contribution of  de novo lipogenesis to hepatic triglycerides

 The enrichment of  HTG methyl hydrogens from 2H-enriched body water 
provides a measure of  the contribution of  DNL to the total HTG pool. The 
triglyceride methyl hydrogens are directly traceable to the original acetyl-CoA 
precursor and they are also well resolved in the 2H NMR spectrum of  hepatic 
triglycerides isolated by a simple Folch extraction. The intensity of  the methyl 
2H NMR signal reflects both the 2H-enrichment at that site and the quantity of  
triglycerides in the NMR tube. Therefore, with constant triglyceride amounts, 
differences in 2H-signal intensities between two samples reflect different levels 
of  2H-enrichment. The spectra shown in Figure 6.5 represent 175 mmol portions 
of  hepatic triglycerides extracted from livers of  a SC and a HF diet-fed animal 
(Figure 6.5 A and B, respectively). The two samples had equivalent amounts of  
triglycerides, as shown by the equal triglyceride 1H NMR signal intensities of  
their 1H NMR spectra. However, the 2H NMR signal intensities were ~10-fold 
higher in SC compared to HF diet-fed animals, indicating that the extent of  
2H-incorporation into the triglyceride of  the SC fed animal was much greater 
compared to that of  its HF diet-fed companion. From the 1H and 2H NMR 
data, triglyceride methyl 2H-enrichment levels were estimated as described in the 
methods. By relating these enrichment values to that of  body water, the fraction 
of  HTG derived from de novo lipogenesis was derived (see Table 6.2). Body water 
enrichment was slightly but significantly elevated in HF fed animals relative to 
SC which may reflect a higher body lipid fraction in the former group. In animals 



154 Chapter 6

given a SC diet, 10.9% ± 1.0% of  total HTG was derived from lipogenesis over a 
48 h period while the remaining 89.1% ± 1.0% was either obtained from dietary 
sources or was present before the administration of  deuterated water. With HF 
diet, the lipogenic fraction was reduced approximately 10-fold, accounting for 
only 1.0% ± 0.2% of  total HTG (p &amp;lt;0.01 compared to the lipogenic contribution 
in SC fed animals).

6.4. Discussion

6.4.1. Effect of  diet on hepatic triglyceride levels

 When rats were placed on a HF diet for 5 weeks, HTG levels increased 
around 3-fold within the first week but then stabilized over the remaining four 
weeks. The results presented in here resemble previous studies of  HTG levels in 
rats placed on a HF diet where HTG, measured by the gold-standard post-mortem 
enzymatic assay, increased by 200% in the first two weeks of  HF diet (Gauthier et 
al. 2006). In a separate study, a 3-fold increase in HTG was found after 3 days of  
placement on a HF diet (Samuel et al. 2004) whereas others only showed a ~30% 
increase in HTG after 4 weeks of  a diet containing 40% of  the total calories as 
lard (Hudgins et al. 1996). A 3-fold increase in HTG is a relatively modest change 
when compared to HTG levels in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH), the most severe form of  non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), 
or in rat models of  diet-induced NASH. Normal human HTG levels are similar 
to that of  the rat (1-2%) while NASH subjects with or without T2D have HTG 
ranging from 10-50%. In rat models of  diet-induced NASH (rats placed on a 
choline-deficient diet), HTG accumulates to ~40% of  liver mass (Grattagliano 
et al. 2003).  
 These studies showed that elevated HTG levels induced by HF diet 
feeding quickly reverted to basal values when the rats were weaned on a SC 
diet, thus demonstrating the reversibility of  this process and the high sensitivity 
of  HTG to diet modification. The findings reported in here are analogous to 
recent observations in T2D patients, where elevated HTG levels were restored 
to normal values in a relatively short time by dietary intervention (Petersen et al. 
2005). Alterations in rat HTG levels were not accompanied by changes in plasma 
triglycerides, suggesting that the liver may play a role as a systemic buffer in the 
face of  dietary fat overload. These observations also demonstrate that an increase 
in HTG is among the earliest observable change in whole body lipid status when 



	 	 	      Chapter 6 157

rats are challenged by HF diet feeding and the utility of  localized single-voxel 1H 
MRS for noninvasively monitoring this change. However, even though single-
voxel 1H MRS was validated in vivo against histological and enzymatic assays of  
HTG content (Szczepaniak et al. 1999, Garbow et al. 2004), possible caveats 
include the presence of  focal steatosis (Timlin and Parks 2005), where HTG 
concentrations measured by localized MR might differ from the mean value 
measured by post-mortem enzymatic assay.   

6.4.2. Sources of  hepatic triglycerides

 The fatty acid components of  HTG can be derived from outside the 
liver or can be synthesized within by DNL. While the contribution of  DNL to 
systemic fatty acid synthesis has been determined in both rats and humans by 
various tracer methods, there are no reports on its contribution to HTG levels. 
Even though DNL rates are quite small in relation to total body lipid mass, they 
assume much higher significance in relation to the much smaller HTG pool size 
and could therefore play an important role in the regulation of  HTG levels.      
 The association between DNL flux assessed by whole body fatty acid 
synthesis rates, HF feeding, and HTG has been explored in both healthy rats 
and T2D models. Placement of  both healthy rats and the lean littermates of  
ZDF rats on a HF diet resulted in a reduction of  DNL activity (Pichon et al. 
2006) whereas in the obese ZDF rats, with elevated HTG content (Kuhlmann 
et al. 2003), DNL rates were unchanged (Lee et al. 2000). Since HTG levels 
reflect the balance between fatty acid import, DNL and triglycerides export, the 
relationship between DNL fluxes and the contribution of  DNL to HTG levels 
is not known. The studies presented in here indicate that DNL contributions to 
HTG are modest for healthy animals on a SC diet but are essentially negligible 
when they are placed on a HF diet. Therefore, the increase in HTG levels during 
HF diet feeding is almost entirely driven by uptake and esterification of  extra-
hepatic fatty acids.   



158 Chapter 6

 The effects of  diet and pathophysiology on DNL in rats have strong 
parallels with observations of  DNL in humans. In humans, the fractional 
contribution of  DNL to hepatic lipid synthesis was noninvasively inferred from 
the analysis of  triglyceride derived from the plasma fraction of  very low density 
lipoproteins (VLDL) (Hudgins et al. 1996, Timlin and Parks 2005). In healthy 
humans, HF feeding over 25 days resulted in a sharply reduced DNL contribution 
to VLDL triglyceride compared to subjects given a low fat diet (Hudgins et 
al. 1996). These observations bear a strong resemblance to the results in rats 
presented in here and indicate that for both healthy rats and humans, DNL is 
highly attenuated by short term HF diet feeding. The effects of  longer term HF 
feeding on DNL rates have not been characterized in humans. In subjects with 
NAFLD, a common endpoint of  excessive long term dietary fat intake, DNL 
contributions were found to be chronically elevated under both fed and fasting 
conditions (Donnelly et al. 2005). These observations suggest that the regulation 
of  DNL by dietary substrates was not functional, and resemble the absence 
of  dietary DNL regulation observed in obese ZDF rats. Overall, these studies 
indicate a strong similarity in DNL between rats and humans and support the 
use of  rat models for investigating the effects of  diet, endocrine status and 
interventions on DNL. 
 Deuterated water is a highly convenient tracer for quantifying DNL, 
as steady-state enrichment in plasma is achieved within minutes after an i.p. 
injection bolus (see Chapter 4) which can then be maintained indefinitely by 
providing a maintenance level of  2H

2
O enrichment in drinking water. However, 

the measurement relies on some untested assumptions. It was considered that 
pyruvate was the main source of  lipogenic acetyl-CoA and that the exchange 
of  pyruvate methyl protons with those of  the water is essentially complete 
(Rognstad et al. 1974, Kuwajima et al. 1986). Thus, the 2H-enrichment of  body 
water is assumed to be equal to that of  acetyl-CoA and hence can be used as the 
precursor enrichment. To the extent that the methyl hydrogens of  acetyl-CoA 



	 	 	      Chapter 6 159

are not fully exchanged with those of  body water, the DNL contribution will 
be underestimated. With Mass Spectrometry (MS) measurements of  2H lipid 
enrichment, a correction factor, known as the N value, corresponding to the 
average number of  deuterium atoms incorporated into palmitate, is applied to 
account for incomplete exchange (Diraison et al. 1996). For in vivo rat studies, N 
was determined to be 22, corresponding to an exchange fraction of  22/31, or 
~75% complete. Acetyl-CoA precursors, such as pyruvate, exchange extensively 
with bulk water, hence fatty acyl hydrogens derived directly from acetyl-CoA, 
including the terminal methyl hydrogens, may have a somewhat higher enrichment 
level (Rognstad et al. 1974, Kuwajima et al. 1986). Assuming a 75% rather than a 
100% extent of  2H-incorporation into acetyl-CoA, the reported DNL estimates 
would increase from 10.9% to 14.3% for the SC fed rats and from 1.0% to 1.3% 
for the HF diet group. 
 The other key assumption behind our estimates of  lipogenic and non-
lipogenic contribution to HTG is that the HTG pool turned over completely 
during the 72 hour exposure to 2H

2
O. To the extent that HTG was incompletely 

turned over, this measurement underestimates the DNL contribution. In healthy 
humans, 9.2 grams of  triglycerides per day are exported as VLDL (Vedala et al. 
2006). Assuming a liver mass of  1.5 kg and HTG levels of  1%, giving a HTG pool 
size of  15 grams, the daily output represents ~60% of  HTG, hence the pool is 
completely replaced in less than 2 days. Given the faster basal metabolic rate of  
the rat, it was assumed that under this study conditions, HTG were completely 
turned over within the 72 hour period of  2H body water enrichment. However, 
triglyceride turnover in steatotic livers may be longer, given the increased pool 
size, hence under these conditions, the period of  body water 2H-enrichment may 
need to be extended.

6.4.3. Relationship between hepatic triglycerides and glycemic status

 In animal models, glycemic control and IR are highly associated with 
the accumulation of  triglycerides in liver and skeletal muscle (Oakes et al. 1997a, 
Oakes et al. 1997b). These sites have a selective contribution to the pathogenesis 
of  IR and hyperglycemia in that the accumulation of  intramyocellular lipid 
(IMCL) in skeletal muscle impairs the action of  insulin on the whole body 
disposal of  glucose, while increased hepatic triglyceride is associated with an 
impairment of  endogenous glucose production (EGP). During the transition 
to HF diet feeding, the hepatic triglyceride pool - because of  its relatively small 
mass and high turnover – is likely to be modified faster and by a larger degree 
compared to IMCL. Therefore at this early stage, the reduced ability of  insulin 
to suppress postprandial EGP could play an important role in the development 
of  glucose intolerance. 
 Studies in healthy animals following 3 days on a HF diet showed that, 
while insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and basal EGP were not different from 
control animals maintained on a SC diet, under hyperinsulinemic clamp conditions 
there was an impaired suppression of  EGP, indicative of  hepatic IR (Gauthier et 
al. 2006). In this study, the extent of  glucose intolerance induced by 35 days of  
HF feeding was relatively modest, as seen by comparable fasting blood glucose 
and insulin levels to animals maintained on the SC diet. A previous study reported 
enhanced IR and glucose intolerance after 4 weeks of  a HF diet (Srinivasan et al. 
2004). Seven weeks of  a HF diet in healthy rats was also associated with higher 
blood glucose 2 hours after the oral glucose challenge (Huang et al. 2004). The 
mild loss of  glucose tolerance that it was observed in this study may reflect the 
relatively small increment of  HTG levels in comparison to that observed in 
T2D rat animal models with severe glucose intolerance (Garbow et al. 2004). In 
comparison to the clamp measurement, a glucose tolerance test does not provide 
direct measurements of  insulin action on glucose production and disposal fluxes 
and therefore may not resolve hepatic and peripheral IR. However, as with 1H 



	 	 	      Chapter 6 161

MRS analysis of  HTG, a glucose tolerance test can in principle be repeated in 
the same animal and may therefore be useful for relating longitudinal changes in 
HTG with alterations in glycemic status for individual animals. 

6.5. Conclusions
 
 In healthy rats, hepatic triglyceride levels can be acutely raised or lowered 
by altering the dietary fat content and these changes can be effectively monitored 
by 1H MRS. During HF feeding, essentially all of  the hepatic triglyceride is 
derived from dietary lipid with very little contribution from DNL. 1H MRS 
is a noninvasive and accurate technique suitable for longitudinal studies of  
evaluation of  hepatic triglyceride content in animal models and can be used for 
assessing the effects of  dietary interventions. The novel 2H NMR measurement 
of  hepatic triglyceride 2H-enrichment from 2H

2
O reported in here, in spite of  

requiring further validation, is a simple and practical approach for assessing the 
contribution of  de novo lipogenesis to hepatic triglyceride levels.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

	 Alterations	in	hepatic	metabolic	fluxes	play	an	important	role	in	the	loss	
of 	 glucose	 homeostasis	 that	 is	 associated	 with	 certain	 nutritional	 imbalances	
(i.e.,	 high	 fat	 (HF)	 or	 sugar	 feeding)	 or	 pharmacological	 interventions	 (i.e.,	
immunosuppressant	drugs	such	as	glucocorticoids	and	calcineurin	inhibitors).				
	 To	better	define	the	relationship	between	hepatic	metabolic	fluxes	and	
the	development	of	whole	body	insulin	resistance	(IR)	and	glucose	intolerance	
in	these	settings,	novel	noninvasive	assays	of	hepatic	glucose	and	lipid	fluxes	
were	developed	and	applied	to	both	human	subjects	and	animal	models.	These	
measurements	were	accompanied	by	standard	clinical	assessments	of	plasma	
insulin	 and	 glucose	 levels,	 thus	 allowing	 whole	 body	 glucose	 tolerance	 and	
insulin	sensitivity	to	be	correlated	with	hepatic	metabolic	activity.	In	particular,	
the	 insulin-mediated	 rates	 of 	 hepatic	 glucose	 production	 (HGP)	 under	 both	
basal	 fasting	 conditions	 and	 in	 the	 face	 of 	 a	 glucose	 challenge	 were	 assessed	
to	 provide	a	 measure	 of 	 hepatic	 insulin	 resistance.	 HGP	 was	 resolved	 into	 its	
gluconeogenic	and	glycogenolytic	components	in	order	to	define	the	role	of	
these	pathways	in	sustaining	normal	and	abnormal	HGP	rates.			
	 In	 6-h	 fasted	 healthy	 animals,	 tracer	 measurements	 revealed	 that	 all	
plasma	glucose	was	derived	from	HGP	with	equal	contributions	from	hepatic	
gluconeogenesis	and	glycogenolysis	fluxes.	At	60	minutes	after	a	glucose	load,	
HGP	 contribution	 dropped	 to	 55%	 of 	 total	 plasma	 glucose,	 but	 this	 was	 not	
accompanied	by	a	shift	in	HGP	source	fluxes.	Thus,	in	healthy	animals,	while	
a	glucose	load	diluted	the	contribution	of 	HGP	to	total	plasma	glucose,	it	did	
not	result	in	a	significant	reorganization	of	HGP	source	fluxes.	Lactate	derived	
from	Cori	cycle	metabolism	of	the	administered	glucose	load	was	the	principal	
hepatic	gluconeogenic	precursor.	Hepatic	glycogen	synthesis	accounted	for	a	
very	minor	portion	(&lt;2%)	of	the	total	glucose	load	disposal.	Surprisingly,	given	



170 Concluding	Remarks

the	sole	presence	of 	glucose	and	the	absence	of 	other	substrates,	the	indirect	
pathway	 contributed	 to	 the	majority	 (~60%)	of	hepatic	 glycogen	 synthesis.	
Fasting	and	postprandial	plasma	glucose	and	insulin	concentrations	were	similar	
to	those	reported	in	previous	rodent	studies	of 	glucose	loading.	On	this	basis,	
the	observed	hepatic	fluxes	are	representative	of	the	standard	physiological	and	
endocrine	responses	to	a	glucose	load.
	 In	comparison,	overnight-fasted	humans	also	derived	all	plasma	glucose	
from	HGP	with	similar	gluconeogenic	and	glycogenolytic	contributions	to	that	
observed	in	6-h	fasted	rats.	After	an	oral	glucose	load,	HGP	contributed	to	a	
much	smaller	fraction	of	plasma	glucose	(&lt;	15%)	suggesting	that	HGP	was	
suppressed	more	efficiently	in	the	human	compared	to	the	rat	studies.	Through	
the	noninvasive	assay	of	uridine	diphosphate-glucose	(UDP-glucose)	enrichment,	
direct	and	indirect	pathway	contributions	to	hepatic	glycogen	synthesis	were	
evaluated	and	found	to	contribute	~50%	of	hepatic	glycogen	synthesis	flux.	
Fasting	and	postprandial	plasma	glucose	and	insulin	concentrations	were	similar	
to	 those	 reported	 in	 previous	 human	 studies	 and	 reflected	 normal	 glucose	
tolerance	 and	 insulin	 sensitivity	 as	 determined	 by	 the	 Homeostasis	 model	
assessment	of	insulin	resistance	(HOMA-IR).				
	 Healthy	animals	placed	on	a	HF	diet	for	20	days	showed	normal	fasting	
glycemia.	Consistent	with	previous	reports	of	loss	of	insulin	sensitivity	secondary	
to	HF	diet	feeding,	there	was	mild	glucose	intolerance	after	a	glucose	challenge,	
as	seen	by	systematically	higher	plasma	glucose	levels	from	20-60	minutes	after	
the	 glucose	 load.	 HGP	 rates	 and	 source	 contributions	 (gluconeogenesis	 and	
glycogenolysis)	were	not	significantly	different	from	animals	fed	on	a	standard	
chow	 (SC)	 diet	 and	 postprandial	 hepatic	 glycogen	 levels	 were	 also	 similar.	
Therefore	the	observed	glucose	intolerance	is	not	the	result	of 	altered	hepatic	
fluxes	but	rather	a	consequence	of	peripheral	insulin	resistance.	
	 Hepatic	 insulin	 resistance	 is	highly	associated	with	 increased	hepatic	
triglycerides	 (HTG).	 By	 using	 in vivo	 proton	 (1H)	 Magnetic	 Resonance

Spectroscopy	(MRS),	HTG	levels	were	shown	to	be	highly	sensitive	to	dietary	
alterations.	As	a	result	of	8	days	HF	diet	feeding,	HTG	increased	relative	to	
the	controls	and	returned	to	basal	values	after	weaning	on	a	SC	diet	for	the	
same	time	period.	Although	HF	diet	caused	a	tripling	of 	HTG	levels	relative	to	
controls	(~3	%	vs.	~1%	by	weight),	these	changes	are	very	modest	compared	
with	animal	models	of	induced	hepatic	stetatosis,	where	HTG	levels	can	exceed	
40%	of	total	liver	weight.	The	modest	changes	in	HTG	levels	that	accompanied	
HF	diet	feeding	were	not	accompanied	by	alterations	in	hepatic	glucose	and	
glycogen	metabolism.	In	accord	with	the	low	dietary	carbohydrate	to	fat	ratio,	
the	 contribution	 of 	 hepatic de novo lipogenesis	 to	 HTG	 was	 suppressed	under	
these	conditions	and	HTG	were	almost	entirely	derived	from	dietary	lipid.	In	
other	animal	models	of 	hepatic	steatosis,	de novo lipogenesis	may	have	a	far	more	
significant	role	in	escalating	HTG.	The	novel	methods	developed	in	here	for	
measurement	of 	hepatic	de novo	lipogenesis	can	be	easily	transferred	to	the	clinical	
setting	by	providing	deuterated	water	(2H

2
O)	together	with	sulfamethoxazole	

(SMX)	following	analysis	of	the	plasma	very	low	density	lipoprotein	triglycerides	
and	urinary	SMX	conjugates	enrichments.	
	 Fasting	hyperglycemia	and	glucose	intolerance	in	normally-fed	animals	
were	induced	after	administration	of	CsA,	a	widely	used	immunosuppressant	
drug.	 After	 a	 glucose	 challenge,	 CsA-treated	 rats	 were	 less	 able	 to	 suppress	
HGP	relative	to	control	animals.	A	tendency	for	decreased	insulin	secretion	was	
observed	which	is	consistent	with	the	known	impairment	of 	pancreatic	insulin	
secretion	by	CsA.	Thus,	 it	 is	 speculated	 that	 in	CsA-treated	rats,	 alterations	
in	 hepatic	 glucose	 metabolism	 (i.e.,	 hepatic	 insulin	 resistance)	 in	 addition	 to	
diminished	 insulin	secretion	contribute	to	glucose	 intolerance.	In	addition,	a	
bigger	contribution	from	the	glucose	load	to	total	glucose	was	observed	in	CsA-
treated	rodents	which	could	result	from	changes	in	glucose	absorption	and/or	
clearance	profiles.	
	 In	the	clinical	setting,	CsA	treatment	is	associated	with	the	development

of 	 posttransplant	 diabetes	 mellitus	(PTDM).	However,	posttransplant	patients	
also	typically	gain	weight	following	the	transplant	and	the	extent	to	which	PTDM	
is	associated	with	weight	gain	per se,	as	compared	to	the	effects	of 	CsA	alone,	are	
unclear.	
	 Sources	 of	 postabsorptive	 HGP	 were	 studied	 in	 lean	 and	 obese	
posttransplant	 patients	 with	 ongoing	 CsA	 immunosuppressant	 therapy	 and	
compared	 to	 healthy	 controls.	 For	 posttransplant	 patients	 undergoing	 CsA	
immunosuppressant	therapy,	 the	gluconeogenic	contribution	to	fasting	HGP	
was	significantly	increased	in	the	setting	of	PTDM.	This	metabolic	alteration	was	
most	strongly	associated	with	increased	body	mass	index	whereas	CsA	treatment	
per se	provoked	only	modest	alterations	of	HGP	sources	and	was	not	associated	
with	fasting	hyperglycemia	or	hyperinsulinemia.	Thus,	in	posttransplant	humans,	
alterations	 in	 hepatic	 glucose	 fluxes	 that	 contribute	 to	 the	 development	 of	
glucose	intolerance	and	PTDM	are	more	strongly	associated	with	obesity	than	
with	CsA.	
	 In	conclusion,	this	Thesis	advanced	our	understanding	of	hepatic	glucose	
and	 lipid	metabolic	fluxes	 in	both	normal	and	glucose	 intolerant	conditions	
induced	by	diet	and	by	CsA.	Among	other	 things,	defining	the	sources	and	
contribution	of	HGP	to	hyperglycemia	could	prove	useful	for	evaluating	the	
efficacy	of	new	antihyperglycemic	drugs	that	function	by	inhibiting	the	activities	
of	specific	HGP	enzymes.
