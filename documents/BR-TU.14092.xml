resumo 
 O desenvolvimento de estratégias efetivas de conservação para aves marinhas 

depende largamente do grau de conhecimento acerca da distribuição das 
espécies e a sua relação com o meio marinho.  

Compreender as respostas das espécies às mudanças ambientais, em 
particular as variações no seu domínio vital e distribuição, é atualmente um dos 
maiores desafios para ecologistas e conservacionistas. A capacidade das 
espécies para alterarem a distribuição dependerá dos constrangimentos 
impostos pela qualidade e disponibilidade de habitat. As consequências para o 
aumento populacional e conservação dependerão dos benefícios associados 
com a ocupação de novos locais. O desenvolvimento de modelos robustos 
requer a quantificação adequada das variações de fatores ambientais, bem 
como a capacidade de seguir, remotamente ou in s itu, os indivíduos no espaço 
e tempo.  

O objetivo dos Modelos de Distribuição de Espécies, em particular o 
mapeamento preditivo, é providenciar informação espacialmente explícita 
acerca da ocorrência das espécies e de outros elementos ecológicos 
relevantes para o planeamento espacial de acções de conservação. O 
Planeamento Espacial para Conservação é uma abordagem multidisciplinar 
que permite identificar áreas importantes para a biodiversidade e atingir de 
forma eficiente objetivos conservacionistas específicos.  

Os principais objetivos deste trabalho são (1) compreender os principais 
fatores ambientais que afetam a distribuição das espécies alvo, (2) 
compreender os domínios vitais e estratégias de alimentação, em relação às 
colónias, de cada espécie ou grupos alvo de estudo, (3) produzir modelos 
preditivos de distribuição de cada espécie ou grupos alvo de estudo e (4) 
desenvolver e implementar abordagens, baseadas em ferramentas estatísticas 
e de planeamento espacial, para identificar áreas ecologicamente relevantes 
para a conservação das espécies alvo.

abstract 
 The development of effective conservation strategies for seabirds depends 

largely on the knowledge of species distributions and their relationship with the 
marine environment.  
Understanding species responses to environmental changes, and particularly 
shifts in their range size and distribution, is therefore a major current challenge 
for ecologists and conservationists. The capacity of species to shift distribution 
will depend upon the constraints imposed by habitat quality and availability, and 
the consequences for population growth and conservation will depend on the 
fitness benefits associated with the occupation of new sites. Model systems 
require well-quantified range changes and the capacity to track individuals in 
space and time. 
 
The purpose of Species Distribution Models, in particular predictive mapping, is 
to provide spatially explicit information on species occurrence and other 
ecological factors relevant for conservation planning. Spatial Conservation 
Planning is a multidisciplinary approach that allows to identify important areas 
for biodiversity and efficiently achieve conservation goals. 

Our main objectives in this study are (1) to understand the main environmental 
determinants affecting the distribution of the target species, (2) to evaluate 
home ranges and feeding strategies, in relation to breeding colonies, of 
different species or target groups, (3) to produce accurate seasonal probability 
distribution models for each species or target groups (4) to establish 
procedures based on statistic and spatial tools to identify ecologically relevant 
areas for species conservation.

Introduction 

 

The study of animal movement and use of space  combined with predictive distribution 

models are a powerful tool  for understanding species ecology through their life cycles 

(habitat use and selection, habitat connectivity, recruitment, migration, and foraging 

strategies) and to  investigate the impacts of human activities on biological processes 

(Tremblay et al. 2009b; Franklin 2010). This information is essential to develop appropriate 

conservation strategies for target species, particularly for those that occupy pelagic areas 

and undertake inter-continental movements, which are challenging to study regarding 

their life offshore as is the case of many seabirds. 

 

In the marine environment, the processes that regulate the patterns of species 

distributions are still an area of intensive research (Tremblay et al. 2009a, 2009b). However, 

it is known that the spatial distribution of seabirds is influenced by several biophysical 

factors (Fauchald 2009; Wakefield et al. 2009) such as the topography and physiography of 

the ocean floor, sea surface temperature, salinity, concentrations of chlorophyll, currents, 

prey productivity and also by human-induced factors, such as pollution, noise or fishing 

activity (González-Solís &amp;amp; Shaffer 2009; Croxall et al. 2012). Understanding species 

distribution and the effect environmental factors play in promoting or constraining the use 

of specific areas is paramount for undertaking evidence based management and 

biodiversity conservation decisions (Sutherland et al. 2004; Pullin &amp;amp; Knight 2009). For 

instances, quantifying the spatial and temporal  overlap between foraging seabirds and 

fishing and fishing method, is essential to reduce both the competition for same resources 

and the direct mortality of pelagic birds due to some types of fishing gear (Belda &amp;amp; Sánchez 

2001; Tuck et al. 2011; Croxall et al. 2012).

Classical methods of acquiring information on animal occurrence in the marine 

environment, would mostly rely on hydrographic boat surveys, boat bird censuses or bird 

ringing at breeding colonies, and dead recoveries on the coast which generated very limited 

spatial-temporal information and would be severely biased. This was primarily due to the 

fact that the spatial mathematical processing of data was very limited until quite recently. 

However, both technological and computational techniques have evolved significantly over 

the past decade and at present, a number of suitable tools to collect detailed information 

on animal movement are available as well as to analyse positional data in a refined and 

detailed form (Croxall et al. 2005, 2012; Wilson et al. 2007; Aarts et al. 2008; Burger 2008; 

Bograd et al. 2010; Soanes et al. 2016). At the same time monitoring the marine 

environment via satellite is particularly useful for studying the environmental variables of 

habitats for species that exhibit great mobility, namely when it involves movements in 

pelagic waters of different economic zones or when migration movements are inter-

continental (Ristow et al. 2000). From spatial optical observations of sea surface it is now 

possible to amass information from remote areas at a relatively reasonable cost, for a wide 

range of environmental characteristics, both physical (temperature of sea surface salinity, 

wind) and biological (ocean productivity, human disturbances, fishing effort distribution) 

(Rodhouse et al. 2001; Wilson et al. 2002). For example, biological productivity can be 

estimated from the phytoplankton abundance, which is estimated from the light absorbed 

by photosynthetic pigments, which in turn are calculated through optical biophysical data 

collected by satellite sensors. This information allows characterizing the different types of 

marine habitats and to investigate the interactions between them and bird distribution.  

 

 

Current technological and industrial capacity of building various miniaturized instruments 

in order to be transported by medium sized seabirds, revolutionize the study of species 

which traditionally were impossible  to track, most noticeable in pelagic habitats (Hunt &amp;amp; 

Wilson 2012). Among these animal tracking equipment, it stands out for their interest, 

relatively affordable prices and reduced dimensions the Light Level Geolocators (GLS) 



 5 

loggers and the Global Positioning System (GPS) loggers.  The weights of GLS loggers range 

from 0.3g upwards, while GPS loggers range from 2-3g upwards (depending on the models, 

battery capacity and spatial resolution). Current guidelines for instrumenting birds state 

that external devices should not exceed 3–5% of the birds’ body mass (Kenward 2001; 

Vandenabeele et al. 2012). 

 

 

The wide availability of remote sensing data, GPS devices and computing power led 

simultaneous developments on computer and statistical sciences, which now provide the 

methodological and theoretical frameworks for predictive ecology (Roberts et al. 2010). 

Nowadays, Geographic Information System (GIS) software allows the analytic integration 

of animal movement data and marine environmental variables, contributing to a better 

understanding of the multidimensional nature of marine ecosystems. Furthermore, the 

simplification of data sorting and preparation for species distribution modelling (e.g. 

spatially rarefying occurrence localities, preparation of climate data, and creation of 

background bias files) and the easy access to several statistical software packages, allowed 

the development of Species Distribution Models (SDMs) analysis (Guisan &amp;amp; Thuiller 2005) 

in predictive ecological studies (Brown 2014). In recent years, the mathematical algorithms 

and methodologies to analyse movement patterns and spatial modelling have evolved 

significantly (Aebischer et al. 1993; Guisan &amp;amp; Zimmermann 2000; Jonsen et al. 2003; Aarts 

et al. 2008; Wakefield et al. 2009) and multiple methods are currently available. A major 

distinction among these is the kind of species occurrence data they require (Elith et al. 

2010). Analysis of species occurrence data collected systematically (presence-absence 

data) usually use regression methods, like generalized linear or additive models, GLMs or 

GAMs, or ensembles of regression trees, random forests or boosted regression trees, BRT 

(Elith &amp;amp; Graham 2009; Elith et al. 2010). However, most studies on species distributions are 

not based on systematic surveys due to the limited spatial coverage or other 

methodological or logistic constraints thus resulting in presence-only data. This is the case 

of most of studies involving seabird tracking. In general, most seabird species usually 

present a highly mobile behaviour (daily and/or seasonally), presenting relatively large 



 6 

home ranges, which makes them particularly difficult to study at sea using standardized 

methods that require a good spatial coverage. Studies involving standardized census 

methodologies at sea usually are very expensive and involve complex logistics, therefore a 

suitable alternative is to track individual seabirds using bio-logging devices but attaining 

presence-only data. The necessity to maximize the utility of this kind of species occurrence 

data has led to the emergence of several SDM methods for modelling presence-only data. 

MaxEnt software package (Phillips et al. 2006) is particularly popular in species 

distribution/environmental niche modelling, most likely due to: (1) is one of the most 

practical methods for modelling species distributions; (2) it typically outperforms other 

algorithms based on predictive accuracy; (3) it requires only presence data plus 

environmental information for the entire study area. Phillips et al. (2006) and Elith et al. 

(2010) provide information about MaxEnt mathematical computations, while Merow et al. 

(2013) provides a detailed explanation of its mechanics. 

 

 

Post-modelling analyses of species distribution models have also been simplified over time 

(e.g. assessment of the distributional changes between time periods or differences in 

habitat use between species, populations or sex) (Warren et al. 2010; Brown 2014). This 

simplification of processes usually relies on the development of software packages to 

automatize data processing, simplify outputs generation or facilitate decision making. One 

good example of this kind of software is Zonation, a publically available decision support 

system for spatial conservation planning. It produces a hierarchical prioritization of the 

landscape and identifies areas important for retaining habitat quality and connectivity for 

multiple species, indirectly aiming at species’ long-term persistence. Zonation produces a 

complementarity-based priority ranking (Moilanen 2005). By combining SDM with spatial 

prioritization analysis it is possible to take biodiversity conservation actions, for instances 

by defining Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) (Kelleher 1999; Lascelles et al. 2016; Soanes et 

al. 2016).

Thesis objectives  

 

This study aims to assess how relevant eco-geographical variables influence the 

distribution, at different spatio-temporal scales, of umbrella species for marine 

conservation. Using predictive distribution models, based on habitat suitability of the study 

areas, it aims to produce relevant tools to support decision-making and establish effective 

conservation and management plans. This is achieved by undertaking the following overall 

objectives: 

 

1. Understand the distribution of target marine bird species in the study areas.  

 

2. Evaluate home ranges and feeding strategies, in relation to breeding colonies, of 

different species or target groups. 

 

3. Relate the occurrence of birds with relevant environmental and ecological variables (eg. 

bathymetry, slope, distance to shore, distance to colony, winds, productivity, sea surface 

temperature, salinity). 

 

4. Identify, using modelling techniques, important areas for the conservation of species. 

 

Thesis structure  

 
This thesis is organized in five chapters. The first chapter presents a general introduction 

about the theme and aims of the thesis. Research questions are presented in the three 

following chapters (Chapter 2 to 4) in the format of scientific articles, specifically written 

for the thesis and adapted to manuscript format for future submission for publication . 

These papers are intended to be independent and mutually exclusive, thus some repetition 

may occur. The main findings of the research are summarized and generally discussed in 

the final chapter.

Tracing the steps of giants: modelling global distribution

Abstract 

 

Northern and Southern Giant Petrels (Macronectes halli and Macronectes giganteus) are 

amongst the most pelagic bird species. We tracked 14 male and 11 female Northern Giant 

Petrels (NGP) and 13 male and 15 female Southern Giant Petrels (SGP), at Bird Island, South 

Georgia, using Geolocators. Seasonal species distribution models, for each species and sex 

group, were computed using MaxEnt. Giant Petrels’ summer distribution seems to be 

strongly constrained by the proximity to breeding colony. It stands out that SGP have wider 

high-probability of occurrence areas around colonies and a greater niche breadth than 

NGP. Summer ecological niches clearly reflect the fact that both species are central place 

foragers. The winter models present clear evidences of post-reproductive dispersal effects, 

reflecting a latitudinal segregation between species. The two species seem to compete and 

share a common preference for the same environment. However, SGP seem to prefer 

intraspecific competition rather than to compete with NGP.

Introduction 

 

The development of effective conservation strategies for seabirds depends largely on the 

knowledge of species distributions and their relationship with the marine environment. 

Early pelagic seabird tracking studies tended to describe habitat use qualitatively 

(Wakefield et al. 2009). But during recent years and as a response to the growing need for 

a thorough understanding of species geographical distribution, new predictive modelling 

techniques have been developed and improved, allowing to extrapolate potential 

distribution of species as a proxy for actual observations (Souza Muñoz et al. 2009; Franklin 

2010). These approaches interpolate spatially occurrence data and eco-geographical 

variables (both biotic and abiotic factors) to create a model of species’ environmental 

requirements, over large spatial scales (Anderson et al. 2003). Such computational 

advances led to the growth of an interdisciplinary approach, that uses Machine Learning 

methods to model complex ecological processes and patterns (Olden et al. 2008). One of 

these methods is MaxEnt, specifically designed to develop species distribution models 

(SDM) with “presence-only” occurrence data (Dudík et al. 2007). However, SDM applied to 

marine species requires the use of oceanic environmental predictors. But the ongoing 

technological revolution has allowed establishing a vast archive of remotely sensed data 

for the oceans and thus timely global oceanographic data from satellites are becoming 

readily available, for both pelagic and neritic environments. Many of these variables (e.g. 

sea water temperature), are mapped at a coarse spatial scale, which is unsurprising given 

the vast expanse and dynamic nature of the oceans, but this variation also limits the ability 

to establish valid correlations between marine species movements and habitat variables. 

(Franklin 2010). Nevertheless, these datasets allow attaining the environmental predictors 

in order to apply SDM to marine species. 

 

 

 



 17 

Marine species pose a particularly difficult challenge with regard to their use of space as 

they perform vast movements during the different stages of their annual cycle. Remote-

tracking studies during the last decade have greatly contributed to address this lack of 

information and have allowed new insights into the spatial component of trophic niches of 

seabirds (González-Solís et al. 2007; Burger and Shaffer 2008; Tremblay et al. 2009). 

Records obtained through remote-tracking can be considered as presence-only data, 

because they allow attaining information on species presence but don’t allow inferring 

about absence, since this information is relative to a sample of the total population. 

Therefore, the number of tracked birds (sample size) will greatly influence the quality of 

the global information for the species distribution. In this sense, Light Level Geolocators 

(GLS) present two major advantages for these type studies. Firstly, their low energy 

consumption allows its use during long periods of time, which allows amassing movement 

data for a complete annual cycle. Secondly, these devices have a relatively low cost which 

allows, deployment on a larger sample of individuals at a low cost. 

 

Northern and Southern Giant Petrels (Macronectes halli and Macronectes giganteus) are 

amongst the most pelagic bird species. These two sibling species have a sympatric 

distribution and coexist at a number of sub-Antarctic archipelagos (Hunter 1987, Patterson 

et al. 2008). Previous studies focused on their spatial ecology, comparing foraging areas 

exploited by individuals of the same colony and investigating interspecific and intersexual 

competition (González-Solís et al. 2000a, b; González-Solís et al. 2002; González-Solís et al. 

2007). 

 

Our main aims in this study were (1) to understand the ecological segregation and the main 

environmental determinants of the distribution of male and female northern and southern 

giant petrels, and (2) to produce accurate seasonal probability distribution models for each 

species and gender group, in order to obtain predictive occurrence maps at a global scale. 

These results can be used as a tool to implement conservation management actions.

Methods 

 
Fieldwork 

 

Fieldwork was carried out on Bird Island, South Georgia (54q, 03´S, 38q 36’W) in October to 

March 1999 to 2001. On this island, estimated breeding pairs of northern and southern 

giant petrels in 1996 was 2062 and 521, respectively (D.R.Briggs and R.Humpidge in litt.) 

(González-Solís et al. 2000a). The study colony comprised a few breeding aggregations of 

giant petrels from both species, sometimes breeding intermingled, totalling more than 150 

nests for each species. In November 1999, we deployed 100 Geolocators (GLS) mounted 

on a Darvic ring in equal proportions on male and female northern and southern giant 

petrels during the incubation period. GLS were deployed on a single member of each pair 

to minimize any potential impact of the GLS on the breeding performance. We recovered 

63, 7 and 1 GLS after 1, 2 and 3 years respectively, and downloaded complete data from 14 

male and 11 female northern giant petrels and 13 male and 15 female southern giant 

petrels. Eleven GLS could not be recovered because they had fallen off the Darvic ring; the 

remaining 18 birds were not seen in the area over the following two years. The GLS used in 

this study were developed by the British Antarctic Survey and weighed 16 g. The GLS were 

equipped with an internal clock and measured the light levels every 60 s, recording the 

maximum reading within each 10 min interval (full details in (Afanasyev 2004). From this 

information 2 positions per day (one corresponding to midday and the other to midnight) 

can be inferred with an average accuracy of 186 km ± 114 km (Phillips et al. 2004a). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 19 

Positioning and filtering procedures  

 

Positions were calculated using Multitrace-3/16 light (Jensen Software Systems, 1997) by 

inspecting the integrity of the light curve day by day and fitting dawn and dusk times. The 

elevation angle of the sun was set at -5.5. To filter unrealistic positions, we removed: (a) 

those obtained from light curves showing interferences at dawn or dusk (mainly due to the 

bird sitting on the ground or to the proximity of artificial light); (b) those inferred from days 

or nights longer than 23 hours; (c) those with a speed index (Vi) above 60 km/h, as 

calculated by the root of the square speed average of the segments formed with the two 

preceding and the two following positions (McConnell et al. 2004): 

 

 

 

Where Vi,j+i is the velocity between successive positions i and j+i; (d) those within the 

equinox periods ranging from 19 March to 9 April and from 3 to 29 September (we set the 

equinox periods after a graphical inspection of the behaviour of the speed index over the 

year). By this procedure we discarded 24.9% of 44,349 positions (González-Solís et al. 

2007). The analyses of the relationships between positions and the environmental variables 

were restricted to an one year period, from 1st of November 1999 to the 31st October 2000 

(25,847 positions). 

 

 

Background information, data sources and geographical procedures  

 

The main purpose of this work was to obtain predictive distribution maps at a wide 

geographical scale, so all data were converted to a WGS84 projection. Since we tracked the 

movements of giant petrels using GLS with a nominal accuracy of 186 km we analysed large-

scale habitat selection. Thus, cell size was set to 2° x 2° and the study area was restricted 

to south of 25° South and north of 65° South, because: (1) this area reflects the potential

distribution range of both species; (2) the accuracy of the GLS further south is limited by 

the length of the day and night near the solstice periods; (3) most of the area below 65 º 

south is completely covered by ice (except in some areas in summer) and; (4) this area 

includes the minimum possible portions of land (which giant petrels could not visit apart 

from the coastal areas). To work on spatial data we used ESRI ArcGIS 9.2 and MiraMon 

(Pons 2000).  

 

We considered a set of 16 eco-geographical variables (EGV) of three types: temporal 

environmental variables, static variables and spatial variables (Table 2). Static variables 

included bathymetry and bathymetry slope (derived from bathymetry). The temporal 

environmental variables tested for inclusion in the model were: chlorophyll a 

concentration, ice concentration, sea surface temperature, surface wind speed, surface 

wind direction and rain rate. Spatial variables included distance to giant petrel colonies, 

distance to seals colonies and distance to penguin colonies. 

 

Bathymetry was obtained from the National Geographical Data Center from U.S.A. 

(ETOPO2; http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/global.html). This also allowed us to 

calculate bathymetry slope, using GIS tools.  

 

In addition, we obtained monthly data on the sea surface variables from November 1999 

to November 2000 from the following sources: (1) Chlorophyll a concentration from the 

SeaWiFS project (http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataset/SEAWIFS/index.html); (2) Ice 

concentration from the British Atmospheric Data Center (BADC; http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/); 

(3) Sea surface temperature from the British Atmospheric Data Center (BADC; 

http://badc.nerc.ac.uk); (4) Surface wind speed from QuikScat (Remote Sensing Systems, 

www.remss.com); (5) Surface wind direction from QuikScat (Remote Sensing Systems, 

www.remss.com); (6) Rain rate from QuikScat (Remote Sensing Systems, www.remss.com). 

Based on these monthly data, we calculated seasonal averages for each of these dynamic 

variables. We didn’t consider in this operation missing value raster cells, to avoid bias on 

average results.

Beside this subset of environmental dynamic variables, we decided to also include a group 

of spatial features we considered to have an ecological significance. Both Giant Petrels 

species are known scavengers and they depend on seals and penguin carcasses during 

breeding season. Therefore, it seemed important to include in the variable set EGV that 

could somehow reflect this ecological dependency on carrion availability. This was achieved 

by creating background layers that reflect distance to large seal colonies and distance to 

large penguin colonies in the study area, based on known colonies location and numbers.  

(González-Solís et al. 2007) extensively discussed offshore inter and intra specific spatial 

segregation in giant petrels. Thus, another predictive variable we considered to eventually 

have an ecological significance is distance to other giant petrel colonies.  

 

We also considered important to evaluate the importance of distance to the several fronts: 

Polar Front, Subantarctic Front, Subtropical Front, Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Front 

and southern boundary of Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Information on location of these 

fronts was obtained from Orsi et al. (1995). 

 

These background layers were calculated using the same computational procedure in 

ArcGIS 9.2 to calculate the least cumulative cost distance for each cell to the nearest source 

over a cost surface (excluding all portions of land from the cost surface raster). 

 

 

Species Distribution Modelling Procedures  

 

Classical habitat modelling techniques (e.g. Generalised Linear Model – GLM or Generalised 

Additive Model – GAM) are based on presence-absence data (Guisan and Zimmermann 

2000, Redfern et al. 2006). The data collected using GLS only provides information about 

individuals’ movement. Therefore, this kind of data doesn’t allow one to make correct 

inferences about a species “true” absence. Thus we decide to use a presence-only method 



 22 

to develop predictive distribution models for both sex groups of Northern and Southern 

Giant Petrel, during summer and winter sub-Antarctic seasons. 

 

We have chosen software application MaxEnt 3.1.1, to compute these seasonal habitat 

suitability models, for each species and sex group, and obtain global predictive distribution 

maps based on probability of occurrence. Detailed description of MaxEnt and its 

mathematical computations are given in Phillips et al. (2006, 2004b). 

 

MaxEnt is a general-purpose method for making predictions from incomplete information 

based on the maximum-entropy principle, which assumes that the best approximation to 

a unknown probability distribution is to ensure that it satisfies any constraints that we are 

aware of (Phillips et al. 2004b). Applied to presence only species distribution modelling, the 

idea is to estimate the distribution of a species as a probability distribution across a study 

region, subject to the constraints that each expected predictor variable has to match its 

empirical average over the presence sites. Of all the probability distributions that meet 

these constraints, MaxEnt choose the most unconstrained one, i.e. the one of maximum 

entropy (Phillips and Dudík 2008). Phillips et al. (2006) outlined several MaxEnt advantages: 

(1) It requires only presence data plus environmental information for the whole study area; 

(2) It can utilize both continuous and categorical data and can incorporate interactions 

between different variables; (3) MaxEnt algorithms have been developed in order to ensure 

the optimal probability distribution; (4) The results are amenable for interpretation of the 

form of the environmental response functions. This method has generated great interest 

because in comparisons it has shown higher predictive accuracy than many other methods 

when applied to “presence-only” species occurrence data (Elith et al. 2006, Franklin 2010).  

 

Several studies compared MaxEnt to other presence-only methods with several placing 

MaxEnt on the top-performing methods in terms of prediction accuracy (Elith et al. 2006) 

or concluded that it performed somewhat better than other methods (Hernandez et al. 

2006, Phillips et al. 2006, Pearson and Raxworthy 2007, Phillips 2008, Elith and Graham 

2009). 



 23 

 

We considered 4 independent sample sets (Table 1), based on species and sex: Northern 

Giant Petrels Males (NGPM), Northern Giant Petrels Females (NGPF), Southern Giant 

Petrels Males (SGPM) and Southern Giant Petrels Females (SGPF). So as to evaluate inter 

and intra-specific differences in habitat selection and distribution, we considered two 

different seasons for modelling procedures: Summer (November – March) and Winter 

(June-September). We deliberately excluded data relative to April, May and October 

because: (1) these are transition months between sub-Antarctic seasons; (2) to exclude 

from analysis less accurate positioning data collected around equinox periods.

The objective was to build, for each species gender group, a seasonal model with adequate 

performance using the best subset of environmental variables. In brief, this would lead to 

the production of 8 predictive distribution maps, i.e. two seasonal maps for each 

species/sex group.  

 

To accomplish this objective, the first step was to identify the EGV that are more important 

in predicting occurrence/habitat suitability. The Jackknife test of variable importance was 



 24 

used to evaluate the relative importance of each predictor variable initially considered. The 

training gain is calculated for each variable alone, as well as the drop in training gain when 

the variable is omitted from the full model (Peterson et al. 2007). This way we computed 

an initial model using 16 eco-geographical variables and those with lowest decrease in 

average training gain when omitted were discarded (Table 2 – List of eco-geographical variables 

considered as relevant to predict occurrence and habitat suitability.). The results of this initial full 

model also revealed problems related with interactions between variables. We thus 

decided to reduce the number of variables, including only the most significant ones. To do 

so, we compared models including different sets of predictive variables and evaluated 

which had better performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 

statistic (AUC) was used to test each model’s discriminative ability. We also analysed the 

Omission Rate and Fractional Predicted Area based on the 10 percentile value for presence 

(Table 3).

Each model was projected to global study area, using as projection layer the variable 

distance to giant petrel colonies. 

 

For each species/sex group, we randomly drew from each individual dataset an equal 

number of tracking locations. This way we equalized the weight of each individual in the 

sample, in order to guarantee that the models’ results are representative of the study 

populations (Fieberg et al. 2010, Frair et al. 2010, Hebblewhite and Haydon 2010). We set 



 26 

MaxEnt to remove duplicate presence records from the same grid cell to minimize 

autocorrelation biases. Model evaluation was realized with a two-fold cross validation, 

randomly selecting 70% of sample points as training data and 30% as test data. 

 

 

Niche Overlap and Niche Breadth  

 

In order to quantify the niche similarity between SDMs (amongst groups and between 

seasons), we used a niche overlap index. Warren et al. (2008) state there is no a priori 

justification for any particular measure of environmental-niche differentiation or similarity. 

We use a niche overlap index that compares our mean predicted probability distributions 

defined over geographic space, in which pX,i (or pY,i) denotes the probability assigned by 

the ecological niche model for species X (or Y) to cell i (Warren et al. 2008). The overlap 

metric employed comes from the ecological literature; Schoener’s (1968) statistic for niche 

overlap (D), 

 

? (??,?, ??,?) = ? ?
?
?

 ? |??,? ? ??,?|? , 

 

ranges from 0 (niche models have no overlap) to 1 (niche models identical). 

 

In addition, for each group, we calculated an estimate of niche breadth by applying a 

traditional measure of niche breadth (Levins 1968). Standardized breadth measurements 

range from 0 (one grid cell has a suitability of one, all other cells are zero), to 1, where all 

grid cells are equally suitable (Mandle et al. 2010, Nakazato et al. 2010). 

 

These metrics do not require application of a threshold to produce predictions of presence 

and absence, but rather uses the continuous estimates of habitat suitability directly 

produced by MaxEnt. Niche overlap and niche breadth test were conducted using ENM 

Tools 1.3 (Warren et al. 2008, 2010).

Results 

 

Though having a high AUC score, visual inspection of model results led us to decide to 

exclude some of the 16 initial variables, to correct artefacts resulting from interactions 

between correlated variables. These correlations were causing evident misleading 

predictions in some specific geographical areas. This way, after analysing the global model 

Jackknife results, AUC scores and considering the ecological meaning of each eco-

geographical variable, we decided it was more coherent to consider different groups of 

eco-geographical variables accordingly to season. Both species are more dependent on 

carrion availability during breeding season and have a more pelagic foraging behaviour 

during non-breeding season. Summer and winter model variables are described in Table 2.  

We thought it would be important that final predictive maps could somehow reflect also 

the weight of colony size. To do so, we projected the models considering two different sets 

of information: a. using locations of all Giant Petrel colonies; b. using information on 

locations of large Giant Petrel colonies (more than 300 breeding pairs). We then overlapped 

the results of both projection scenarios and calculated mean results. This procedure 

allowed us to attribute less weight to isolated small colonies, without completely excluding 

their importance from the final predictions. 

 

Model fitting procedures provided models with high AUC scores, for both training and test 

datasets (Table 3). The minimum values for training and test AUC were 0.923 and 0.966, 

respectively, meaning that all models have good predictive performances.

Jackknife test results show that dist_colgps is the most useful variable to explain the 

distribution of each group, on both season, since it has the highest regularized training gain 

with only variable (Figure 1). MaxEnt Jackknife analysis also selected as important variables, 

to all groups and for summer models, dist_seals, dist_cpeng and chla_sum. Regarding 

winter models, jackknife results also identified sst_win, wspeed_win and chla_win as 

important variables to predict NGP male and female distributions; sst_win, chla_win and 

wdir_win are also important EGV to predict SGP male and female occurrence areas.

The summer distribution models predicted high-suitability areas centred around Giant 

Petrel colonies, although they differ for each group in the predicted extent of that area 

(Figure ). For instance, SGPF is the group with wider high-probability of occurrence areas 

during summer months. On the other hand, NGPF is the group with shorter range high-

probability areas. Winter predictions are noticeably different for both species. Both SGP 

groups have wider high-probability areas than NGP groups, and cells with higher scores are 

located more to the South, with a more evenly longitudinal distribution. SGPM have a 

broader high-probability area than SGPF. For NGP males and females, the highest scores 

are located closer to land. NGPM winter model aggregates high-probability areas around 

large colonies, as well as around coastal areas (north coast of Argentina, Uruguay, South 

Africa and Tasman Sea). NGPF winter model shows a similar distribution pattern, but in 

general MaxEnt probability scores are lower than NGPM, meaning that it is harder to 

predict this group’s winter distribution. 

 

 

Predictive models outputs show that, for both seasons, NGP have more fragmented 

potential occurrence areas than SGP. SGPM and SGPF occurrence areas suggest a higher 

potential for population connectivity over a larger region (presence/absence binary maps 

available in Appendix supporting information).

Discussion 

 

One of the main challenges in SDM research involves the inclusion of ecologically relevant 

parameters. Some additional challenges involve the inclusion of migration processes, 

inclusion of theoretical information from population dynamics, incorporation of 

interspecific biotic interactions and modelling functional groups of species (Guisan and 

Thuiller 2005). Our models’ results showed to be effective in addressing these tasks. We 

used presence-only data to generate ecological niche models that (1) describe the seasonal 

habitat preferences, (2) generate seasonal predictive distribution maps and (3) model the 

amount of niche overlap.  

 

MaxEnt produced reliable seasonal distribution predictions for the 4 groups, based on 

datasets with different number of occurrence records. Validation was also satisfactory, 

given the large amount of test data available for each group. Both Training and Test AUC 

scores were considerably high for every model, suggesting a good predictive performance 

in every case. 

 

The coarse spatiotemporal scale approach used in our study may obscure relationships 

with oceanographic features at a small scale, for instance those related with productivity, 

such as moving SST fronts or rich water masses. However, this is unlikely to significantly 

affect our modelling exercise, since seabird numbers are generally influenced by large scale 

current systems and oceanographic features (Shealer 2002, Newton 2003).  

 

Overall, summer ecological niches clearly reflect the fact that both species are central place 

foragers. During the breeding season, giant petrels must return to colony to change 

incubation shift or to feed the hatchlings during guarding and post-guarding period. In 

these periods, male and female giant petrels share duties and alternate foraging trips that 

can last from 1 to 30 days. Several studies show that at this time birds have the highest 

land-based activity, but also travel hundreds or thousands of kilometers to feeding areas. 



 35 

Logically this is reflected on predictive maps, which show high-probability of occurrence 

areas centred on colonies.  

 

Giant petrels’ summer distribution seems to be strongly constrained by the proximity to 

breeding colony. This is corroborated by the fact that the most important variable affecting 

all modelled summer distributions is distance to the breeding colony. The variables 

dist_seals and dist_cpeng also seem to be relevant to all summer models, and have higher 

training gain than both chla and sst (usually related with productivity). These results 

support the idea that during breeding season both species and sexes depend greatly on 

carrion availability. Though, González-Solís et al. (2007) suggested that intersexual 

differences in the exploitation of food resources seem greater than interspecific ones: 

during incubation  males feed mainly on penguin and seal carcasses on shore, while females 

mostly forage at sea. Our results partially agree with this, with SSGPF niche breadth (for 

Levins metric) being clearly higher than the other groups (B1=0.684). Also, SSGPF predictive 

maps show the wider high-probability of occurrence areas. However, SNGPF has niche 

breadth score very similar to SNGPM and SSGPM. Furthermore, intraspecific niche overlap 

is higher than intersexual overlap. 

 

When comparing both species’ summer results, it stands out that SGP have wider high-

probability of occurrence areas around colonies and a greater niche breadth than NGP. The 

winter models present clear evidences of post-reproductive dispersal effects on 

localization of high-probability of occurrence areas, reflecting a latitudinal segregation 

between species. During wintering, NGP males and females high-probability of occurrence 

locations are in northern areas near coast, continental shelf and shelf break. On the other 

hand, wintering SGP have a higher probability of occurrence on southern latitudes. Despite 

easy access to foraging habitats exploited by the other sibling species, SGP seem to prefer 

intraspecific competition rather than to compete with NGP. In this context, the observed 

pattern probably arose from differences in their tolerance to the physical environment as 

well as in their competitive abilities. 

 



 36 

Giant petrels are the seabirds with the highest wing loading, even higher than albatrosses 

(Obst &amp;amp; Nagy 1992, Spear &amp;amp; Ainley 1997), which presumably confers a greater flying 

capability in strong wind conditions (Spear &amp;amp; Ainley 1998). In particular, southern giant 

petrels males are heavier than females and than northern giant petrels having a greater 

wing loading (Pennycuick 1987). This may explain why southern giant petrel males tend to 

visit southern areas in winter, where particularly strong winds may be disadvantageous for 

giant petrel females and other large seabird species. 

 

Winter niche breadth scores are very similar to summer scores. This models’ results show 

the fundamental niche and the reduction on SGP might be related with the fact that during 

winter there is a significant increase on sea ice around Antarctica, thus reducing the 

potential foraging grounds. Similarly to summer models, there is a higher intraspecific niche 

overlap than interspecific overlap. When comparing winter and summer Schoener’s D 

results for each group, it is clear that despite the high overlap between seasonal niches (D 

ranging from 0.66 - 0.78), there is a level of differentiation to be considered. Also, there is 

an increase in niche overlap between sexes of the same species. This can be explained, 

because wintering giant petrels usually do not migrate to new areas but tend to disperse 

to areas similar to those used during the breeding season. However, being free of parental 

duties, birds usually remain in these areas for longer periods than during the breeding 

season. 

 

The two species seem to compete and share a common preference for the same 

environment. However, despite easy access to foraging habitats exploited by the other 

sibling species, southern giant petrels seem to prefer intraspecific competition rather than 

to compete with northern giant petrels.

From locally extinct to a growing population: the range expansion of Audouin’s Gull into 

Portugal and the use of new habitats outside its traditional breeding range 

 

Abstract 

 

The occurrence of Audouin’s Gull (AG) in Portugal is a recent phenomenon. The species 

breeds in the southern region of Algarve, specifically in Ria Formosa. In this work we 

explore the offshore habitat use of GPS tracked Portuguese AG during the breeding season 

in order to quantify the offshore area which might already be protected under the current 

Special Protection Area network in Portugal. The species breeding range at Deserta colony 

was estimated using MaxEnt to develop spatial predictive models. We calculated the 

percentage of SPA area that covers each level of the estimated Core Area of AG occurrence 

around the colony. The current protected area as a reduced overlap with all the three Core 

Area levels selected, resulting in only ca. 4.6 to ca. 8.7% of the area used by the species 

being currently protected.

Introduction 

Range shifts in many different taxa have been widely reported in recent decades (Hickling 

et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2011). However, opportunities to identify the ecological factors 

influencing range expansion are rare, particularly at the spatial scales relevant to species-

based conservation strategies. Understanding species responses to environmental 

changes, and particularly shifts in their range size and distribution, is therefore a major 

current challenge for ecologists and conservationists (Thomas 2010; Guisan et al. 2013).The 

capacity of species to shift distribution will depend upon the constraints imposed by habitat 

quality and availability, and the consequences for population growth and conservation will 

depend on the fitness benefits associated with the occupation of new sites (Sutherland 

1996). Model systems therefore require well-quantified range changes and the capacity to 

track individuals in space and time. 

 

The marine environment currently experiences fast climatic change most noticeably in key 

parameters such as Sea Surface Temperature (Brierley &amp;amp; Kingsford 2009). This is likely to 

influence how organisms distribute themselves, with those species able of doing so, 

potentially expanding or shifting their ranges to areas previously unoccupied. But this 

habitat is also a very a challenging one regarding the monitoring of species’ spatial 

distribution and until the last decade, very little was known regarding the distribution of 

even very large animals (e.g. whales). Most spatial information on marine animals was 

gathered by at sea surveys of direct observation or by tag recovery from fisheries or dead 

recoveries on the shore, which incurred high levels of spatial uncertainty and temporal 

biases. Recent advances in tracking technology, specifically the miniaturization of data 

loggers and transmitters have since allowed individual level tracking of most marine animal 

groups, with seabirds being no exception (Croxall et al. 2005). In fact, developments aimed 

at seabird tracking have revolutionized tracking technology and devices such as 

Geolocators are currently used for individual tracking on other avian systems, e.g. 

shorebirds, passerines (Stutchbury et al. 2009, Conklin et al. 2010), even when positional 

errors of Geolocators range between 100-200 km (Phillips et al. 2004, Clark et al. 2010). 



 47 

Current technology offers GPS precision tracking with very light devices, allowing to 

research space use even of small seabird species, some of which with documented changes 

on their distribution ranges, as in the case of Audouin’s Gull Larus audouinii. 

 

Currently, the Audouin’s Gull (AG) has a global conservation status of Least Concern 

(BirdLife International 2015). This species breeds in Spain (19 461 breeding pairs) - mainly 

the Chafarinas Islands and the Ebro Delta with the later holding 67% of the global 

population (14 177 in 2007 (Gutiérrez &amp;amp; Guinart 2008), Algeria (100-600), Greece (350-

500), Italy (1 153-1 286; Sardinia and Tuscan archipelago), having smaller colonies in 

Portugal (400-460), France (82; Corsica), Cyprus (14-28), Croatia (60-70), Turkey (47-90; 

islets and rocks in the southern Adriatic Sea near Korcula and Peljesac Peninsula),Tunisia 

(70-115) and Morocco (50-300) (all data for breeding pairs, BirdLife International 2015). It 

winters along the coasts of North and West Africa from Libya to Morocco and along the 

Atlantic coasts of Africa in Mauritania, Gambia, Senegal and Gabon (Sanpera et al. 2007), 

with a small wintering population in the eastern Mediterranean along the Aegean coast of 

Turkey (BirdLife International 2015). 

 

Current global population trend (most of it quantified in Europe and encompassing over 

90% of the entire species population), is considered stable or increasing (Barov &amp;amp; Derhé 

2011). This is thought to be mainly the result of increased availability of efficient protected 

areas during the 1980s, and also of discarded fish from trawlers. The effect of discarded 

fish was observed around the Ebro Delta (Criado 1997; Cama et al. 2013), where the colony 

has grown rapidly since 1981 (Gutiérrez &amp;amp; Guinart 2008). The large growth of this species 

in the western Mediterranean has likely caused the breeding population expansion into 

other locations both inside the Mediterranean, with new colonies found in Croatia, and 

also one outside the Mediterranean, in southern Portugal (Birdlife International 2004). The 

occurrence of AG in Portugal is therefore a recent phenomenon (Catry et al. 2010), with 

the species being considered to be threatened and classified as Vulnerable nationally, 

mostly due to the low numbers of breeding pairs (Cabral et al. 2005). The species breeds in 

the southern region of Algarve, specifically in Ria Formosa. Current population is estimated 



 48 

at 1 200 nesting pairs (J. Ramos, pers. comm.), following an initial colonization event 

recorded in 2002 (Leal &amp;amp; Lecoq 2005). Although this recent colonization was most likely 

due to immigration of individuals from Spanish colonies, this can be considered as a 

fragmented subpopulation, given the high degree of isolation in relation to the most 

important breeding colonies (Cabral et al. 2005). In addition, individuals breeding in 

Portugal are the first recorded out of the species traditional Mediterranean breeding range 

(Equipa Atlas 2008).  

 

Here we explore the offshore habitat use of GPS tracked Portuguese Audouin’s Gull during 

the breeding season in order to: (1) model the species habitat used based on 

environmental variables; and (2) quantify the offshore area which might already be 

protected under the current Special Protection Area network in Portugal for this species.

Methods 

 

GPS tracking 

 

Between early May and late June 2015, 6 adults and 7 juvenile Audouin’s Gulls were 

captured on nests and tagged with GPS/GSM dataloggers (Movetech/Fleetronic devices), 

at Deserta Island colony (36.963576°, -7.887174°), in Ria Formosa, southern Portugal. The 

devices were equipped with high efficiency micro-solar panels to recharge the batteries 

and allow long-term remote tracking. The electronic equipment was sealed with 

transparent heat-shrink tube providing resistance to salt water. The devices were attached 

to the back of the birds using a backpack system with chest harness, which has been 

previously used in tracking studies with this and another sibling species elsewhere 

(Camphuysen et al. 2012; Bécares et al. 2015) and proven to be effective and safe for this 

species. The weight of the sealed devices plus the harness varied between 20 and 24g 

(depending on the battery capacity used), roughly representing 3–5% of the bird’s body 

mass. The dataloggers were set to perform 15s wake-ups every 30 minutes. During the 

wake-up, location (Latitude/Longitude), instantaneous speed (m/s) and altitude (m) were 

registered. GSM connection was set to every 6 hours with data being automatically 

downloaded from the datalogger to a remote webserver, whenever GSM connection was 

successfully established. Devices were programmed with a bootloader firmware, to 

prevent battery damage due to under or over charging. This firmware automatically 

controlled the device operation, whenever battery voltage was under 3,8V (switching it off 

until recharge) or above 4,1V (switching it on until battery voltage decreased).

Environmental variables for Spatial Distribution Modelling  

 

When developing Spatial Distribution Models (SDMs), the potential for overfitting 

increases with model complexity (Franklin 2010), we decided to include in this analysis the 

minimum number of eco-geographical variables (EGV) considered relevant to explain 

species distributions (Table 6).  

The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was obtained from the National Geographical Data 

Center from U.S.A. (ETOPO2; http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/2minrelief.html), 

and resampled to a spatial resolution of 0.04167°. This also allowed calculating Slope using 

ArcGIS software. DEM and Slope are topographic variables that are related, at sea, with 

oceanographic dynamics and productivity (Louzao et al. 2006; Tremblay et al. 2009; 

Wakefield et al. 2009; Bécares et al. 2015) and, at land, with the altitude above sea level 

and terrain relief. Available evidence suggest that AG is a coastal species, that doesn’t 

forage too far from shore (Cabral et al. 2005; Catry et al. 2010; García-Tarrasón et al. 2015), 

hence Distance to coast was also added as explanatory variable. The variable Distance to 

Coast is provided as a global data set of distances to the nearest coastline and was acquired 

from http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/DOCS/DistFromCoast/. All other distance variables 

(Distance to the breeding colony, Distance to ports and Distance to Ramsar sites) were 

calculated as Cost Distance in ArcGIS. Distances of locations at sea were assigned with a 

positive value and locations at land with a negative one. The ports location and dimension 

were obtained from http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/MAR.php. Ramsar sites 

location and information is available at https://rsis.ramsar.org/ris-search/. Distance to 

ports was selected as variable because AGs are frequently recorded in flocks at fishing ports 

(García-Tarrasón et al. 2015). Also they often follow fishing boats and the species is known 

for its dependency on fishing discards (García-Tarrasón et al. 2015). Distance to Ramsar 

sites was considered to be a relevant variable, because AG use inland wetlands, for example 

rice fields or salt marshes (Ruiz et al. 1996; Navarro et al. 2010; Roberts et al. 2010; Bécares 

et al. 2015; García-Tarrasón et al. 2015).

using the Marine Geospatial Tools (MGET) for ArcGIS, an open-source collection of 

geoprocessing tools for marine research (Roberts et al. 2010). Sea Surface Temperature 

and Chlorophyll a concentration are considered to directly reflect ocean productivity and 

food availability. Night Sea Surface Temperature was included in the variables list, due to 

the reported AG’s nocturnal foraging habits (García-Tarrasón et al. 2015 and Rodrigues 

2015, unpublished data). All variables were resampled to the coarsest spatial resolution 

(0.04167°), using a geographic coordinate system in WGS-1984 datum. We compared 

models results including different sets of predictive variables and evaluated which had 

better predictive performance. In order to identify and eliminate strongly correlated 

variables (|r|&gt;0.7) prior to the modelling process, ENM Tools software was used to conduct 

a Pearson Correlation test (Warren et al. 2010) (Supplementary Material A). 

 

 

Modelling procedures 

 

Model training and testing was performed with MaxEnt software. MaxEnt is one of the 

most widely used modelling packages, most likely due to: (1) is one of the most practical 

methods for modelling species distributions; (2) it typically outperforms other algorithms 

based on predictive accuracy; (3) it requires only presence data plus environmental 

information for the entire study area. Thus, MaxEnt is a very useful solution to analyse 

tracking data, given it only provides information about species occurrence. Detailed 

description of the MaxEnt and its mathematical computations are given in Phillips et al. 

(2006), Elith et al. (2010) and Merow et al. (2013). We set MaxEnt to remove duplicate 

presence records from the same grid cell to minimize autocorrelation biases. The functional 

forms (known as “feature types”) selection was set to the default option “Auto Features”.  

 

To account for the effects of geographical sampling bias in the acquisition of data, we 

produced separate sampling bias grids for each monthly tracking dataset using SDMtoolbox 

for ArcGIS. This tool creates a bias file for coordinate data (BFCD, downloadable from 

www.sdmtoobox.org) that is clipped to the size of the study area and then constrained to 



 53 

a buffered area around occurrence points. This file accounts for background and 

pseudoabsence sampling biases associated with latitudinal changes in the area 

encompassed by decimal degree units and it can be used as a bias file in MaxEnt. This 

inequality results from convergence of the meridians. The BFCD allows equal sampling of 

background throughout the landscape in geographic projections (Syfert et al. 2013; Brown 

2014). 

 

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve statistic (AUC) was used to test 

each model’s discriminative ability. The Jackknife test of variable importance was used to 

evaluate the relative importance of each predictor variable considered on each model. The 

training gain is calculated for each variable alone, as well as the drop in training gain when 

the variable is omitted from the full model (Peterson et al. 2007; Phillips 2008a). The 

relative importance of each variable was also analysed, as well as the variables response 

curves (details in Syfert et al. 2013). Model evaluation was done by cross-validation, 

randomly splitting occurrence data into a number of equal-size groups (folds) and models 

are trained leaving out each fold in turn. This approach has a big advantage, which is using 

all data for evaluation (Phillips et al. 2006; Phillips 2008b). 

 

 

Niche Overlap 

 

We measured the similarity in predictions between all pairs of SDMs produced by 

quantifying the niche overlap. We used ENMtools software to calculate the Schoener’s D 

statistics (Warren et al. 2008). It ranges from 0 to 1, with zero indicating no niche overlap 

between model solutions and one indicating identical predicted distributions. 

 

 

 

 

 



 54 

 

Core Area definition  

 

To define a core area of AG occurrence around the breeding colony, based not only on 

tracked locations but also on environmental predictors, we used the averaged overall 

model to select areas with aggregated cells (at least 3) having a mean logistic value higher 

than 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7. We used ArcGIS 10.3 to plot contour lines and obtain vector layers 

for these three Core Area levels. We then compared the results with the present spatial 

coverage of the Portuguese SPA network, to analyse potential conservation implications. 

We calculated the percentage of SPA area that covers each level of the estimated Core Area 

and the percentage of Core Area already under SPA designation.

Results 

 

Model evaluation and variables contribution  

 

All three monthly SDMs showed a good (0.9&gt;AUC &gt; 0.8) to excellent (AUC &gt; 0.9) ability to 

predict the habitat used by the AG, during the breeding season (Table 7).

The most relevant variables to the monthly models (Figure 3) were Dist_coast (May and 

June) and SST_month (July), with both variables negatively influence probability of 

occurrence (variables response curves included Supplementary Material B).

monthly SDM is also given by the corresponding percent contribution value. 

 

Predictive Distribution Maps  

 

Models show a similar pattern of probability of occurrence between the three months of 

the breeding season (Figure 4). There seems to be a consistency in terms of spatial use 

during incubation (May) and chick-rearing periods (June and July). The areas with higher 

probability of occurrence values are very similar in the three monthly models solutions. 

This fact is also reflected in the Schoener’s D statistics (Table 8), which indicates high niche 

overlap for every pairwise comparison (ca. 0.8). Thus, a monthly average distribution map 

was calculated in order to obtain robust breeding season potential area of occurrence 

around the breeding colony.

(identical areas).

Core Area protection level  

 

Core Area protection levels are defined by 3 contours 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7, based on the 

averaged overall model (Figure 5). The estimated Core Area only overlaps with one SPA 

(Figure 6), Ria Formosa (PTZPE0017). Therefore, the “SPA total area”, used to calculate 

percentage of overlap with Core Area contours, only considers this site (23269ha). 

 

The proportion of each Core Area level and SPA under the overlap zone represent, both 

the proportion of each Core Area level already designated as SPA (from ca. 8.7 to 4.6%) 

and, the proportion of SPA that already protects each Core Area level (from ca. 69 to 3.5%) 

(Table 9 –SPA percent overlap with the 3 Core Area levels, and percentage of each Core Area included in the 

SPA.).

Core Area level (red – 0.5; purple – 0.6; green – 0.7), based on the averaged overall model (probability of 

occurrence between 0 and 1).

Discussion 

 

 

Audouin’s Gull breeding in Portugal do not visit the species’ traditional foraging areas in 

the Mediterranean during breeding season, neither on other periods (Rodrigues 2015, 

unpublished data). This is a particularly interesting result as the Portuguese population is 

most likely an extension of the Spanish, which has its stronghold in Ebro Delta, hosting 

more than two thirds of the entire breeding population (BirdLife International 2016). 

Population growth and expansion to new locations is attributed to the increased availability 

of fisheries discards close to key breeding colonies, particularly in the Ebro Delta where 

waste from the trawlers is not used industrially to produce food for domestic animals, as 

occurs in other areas, and its rather discarded near the colony (Gutiérrez &amp;amp; Guinart 2008). 

Fishing discards and the creation of protected areas in the 1980s are regarded as the main 

causes for the population recovery (Criado 1997), which increased from only 1000 pairs in 

1975 to 21 161 in the present and current population is stable or increasing (Gutiérrez &amp;amp; 

Guinart 2008; Barov &amp;amp; Derhé 2011). In Portugal however, and despite the very costal 

distribution of the species, the current protected area has a reduced overlap with all of the 

three Core Area levels selected, resulting in only ca. 4.6 to ca. 8.7% of the area used by the 

species being currently protected.  

 

 

The use of new GPS/GSM technology provided good results, likely due to the proximity to 

areas with good GSM cover in coastal Algarve (South Portugal). Tracking data was thus of 

good quality and frequency allowing to create good predictions of occurrence using MaxEnt 

and based on the selected environmental variables. For all breeding months AUC values 

based on the tracking dataset (using 10 folds of the empirical tracking dataset to replicate 

monthly model calculations) were above 0.8 providing high confidence estimates of AG 

occurrence (Syfert et al. 2013). The variables that most contributed to the monthly models 

were Dist_coast (May and June) and SST (July) (Figure 3). Dist_coast is strongly correlated 



 61 

with the excluded variable Dist_colony and it is reasonable to assume that this variable 

reflects the species coastal behaviour, as well as, the limited foraging range in close 

proximity to the colony location, especially during incubation. SST is a proxy for productivity 

that contributes considerably when adults are in the later stages of chick-rearing period 

(July). Bécares et al. (2015) in the Mediterranean found that Dist_colony, Dist_ports (both 

negatively affecting occurrence probability), CHL_month and SST_month were the most 

relevant variables on their predictive models of AGs foraging habitats. Those models were 

based on a larger set of environmental and ecological variables (16 in total), indicating that 

albeit being in a recently occupied location this species relies on the same environmental 

predictors as on the traditional colony with the exception of Ports, which is of little 

relevance in Portugal. This may be due to the fact that we used a binary variable in our 

models to avoid correlation between distance variables. It may be also due to ecological 

differences in both areas, since Spanish ports have large fishing fleets whereas this is not 

the case in Portugal and potentially aggravated by the fact that AGs in the Portuguese 

colony are yet to learn how to explore the discards in the vicinity of ports (see below). Also, 

trawl fleet in Algarve region is relatively small and is mostly concentrated in Portimão 

harbour (about 60km away, in straight line, from the colony). Purse seine and polyvalent 

fleets (that operate on the other ports of Algarve) do not generate large amount of discards 

and offal, as the trawl fleet does. This way AG might feel more attracted to areas where 

trawlers operate, along the continental shelf break. Conversely, DEM and Slope contributed 

considerably on our predictive models but not in the Mediterranean (Bécares et al. 2015). 

Distinct bathymetry between the two foraging areas can potentially justify these 

differences, as depths in costal Mediterranean (a mostly inland sea) are much lower and 

vary less in slope than in the Portuguese Atlantic coast. Regardless of the methodological 

and fine differences between these studies, both highlight the overwhelming contribution 

of distance to colony or coast and productivity for predicting this species distribution during 

breeding season.  

 

 



 62 

The absence from Mediterranean waters of Audouin’s Gull breeding in Portugal indicates 

that these individuals are not dependent on the traditional foraging areas of this species. 

This has occurred in a relatively short time (generation length estimated by BirdLife 

International to be 13 years, BirdLife International 2016), as the colony has only 13 years, 

indicating that colonizer individuals likely started using new foraging grounds as early as 

settlement occurred. Furthermore, it indicates that this thriving breeding population is 

independent from the local scale fluctuations recorded in the Spanish colonies (Barov &amp;amp; 

Derhé 2011). Given the forecasted decline in the unsustainable trawling fishery of the 

largest colony, the Ebro Delta, (Oro et al. 2004; Tavecchia et al. 2007; Barov &amp;amp; Derhé 2011) 

and the potential reduction of small pelagic fish stocks due to increasingly high fishing 

pressure around the Mediterranean breeding grounds, owing partly to high demand of fish 

feed from tuna-farming (Arcos et al. 2008), the Portuguese breeding colony might 

therefore gain regional relevance in the near future. Although some fish stocks in 

Portuguese waters are potentially under pressure (sardines, hake, etc.) (ICES 2015a, 

2015b), the local AG colony is increasing while others remain stable. This indicates the 

urgency in projecting protected areas encompassing the species foraging grounds given the 

current scenario of fishing stock reductions. The Core Area delimitation for the averaged 

overall model shows the species vital area during breeding season ranked in 3 importance 

levels for conservation. At the moment this area should be considered as the most 

important to ensure species conservation in Portugal. 

 

 

Despite the low spatial variation on distribution during the breeding season, there is a 

tendency for predicted areas of occurrence to have a wider latitudinal range in May and a 

wider longitudinal range in June, than in July. This is probably a consequence of the timing 

of breeding season events, as May and part of June will very much refer to incubation, 

when both adults can do larger trips from the colony to feed themselves, whereas July will 

mostly encompass chick rearing phase, when regular feeding of small food items is 

required, likely keeping adults at short distances from the colony (Mañosa et al. 2004; 

Burger et al. 2016). However, and given that the Schoener's D statistic revealed very high 



 63 

niche overlap between the breeding season months these were all averaged into one 

(Warren et al. 2008). This is also supported by the need to protect areas used throughout 

the breeding season given that selecting only one stage (or month) of this period could 

result in decreased fitness. For example, if only offshore areas used during late incubation 

in June are protected, then unprotected coastal sites important during chick rearing could 

potentially result in low feeding rates and consequent depressed chick development and 

even pre-fledging mortality (Vigfusdottir et al. 2013). It is therefore important to plan 

integrated conservation areas ensuring that all stages of the breeding season are 

accounted for.

Abstract 

 

The purpose of SDMs, and in particular of predictive mapping, is to provide spatially explicit 

information on species and other elements of biodiversity for conservation planning. In this 

study, we develop a spatial conservation prioritization for marine birds across mainland 

Portuguese Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), in preparation of eventual future expansion of 

the current conservation area networks and definition of MPAs, as well as, for the 

implementation of management plans on currently established SPAs, with particular focus 

on offshore areas. Our results address many of the conceptual planning needs Portugal has 

for the marine environment. Some of the identified key areas are located in regions thought 

to be important for marine biodiversity, due to their environmental characteristics. The 

final results are also very relevant to undertake in the future best practice management 

actions.

Introduction 

 

The designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is currently considered one of the best 

solutions to ensure the protection of relevant marine species and habitats (Kelleher 1999). 

In a long-term perspective, and besides its primary aim for the conservation of target 

species and/or habitats, MPAs can also play an important role in restoration of 

overharvested and heavily exploited ecosystems. It is therefore essential that the design of 

MPAs is based upon robust information on species occurrence and spatial distribution, as 

well as, on the association between that empirical record and oceanographic 

environmental variables. In the marine environment, the mechanisms that regulate species 

occurrence are still widely debated. Nevertheless, species occurrence and spatial 

distribution data of target species are essential for the implementation of management 

plans, and to evaluate the effectiveness and success of these conservation tools and should 

thus form the base of MPA design and evaluation procedures. 

One of the key challenges that the European Union (EU) biodiversity policy currently faces, 

is the full implementation of the Natura 2000 network in the marine environment. The 

implementation of MPAs is often hindered by legal difficulties in defining reserves on 

international waters, the patchy nature of data in many offshore waters and/or by the 

scarcity of comprehensive data and studies describing long term biological patterns for 

multiple species, particularly in offshore waters (Leathwick et al. 2008). Seabirds are 

relatively easy to monitor offshore as these can be recorded from a boat by direct 

observation and can be used as a starting point for the mapping of potential MPAs, which 

might originate from Important Bird Areas (IBA). In the EU, the identification and 

delimitation of Special Protection Areas (SPAs) for seabirds must be entirely based on 

scientific criteria, such as the percentage of the population of a priority species under the 

Birds Directive, although Member States have a margin of discretion in determining the 

most appropriate criteria (Stroud et al. 2001). In any case, countries must fully apply those 

criteria in a way that ensures that all the ‘most suitable territories’, both in number and 



 75 

surface area, are designated for protection. Based on the information provided by the 

Member States, the European Commission evaluates if the designated sites are sufficient 

to form a coherent network for the protection of the vulnerable and migratory species 

using EU’s waters (European Commission 2007). 

Between 2012 and 2015, Portugal made an important step towards the implementation of 

Natura 2000 network in the marine environment, by enlarging and establishing new marine 

Special Protection Areas (SPAs) for priority species under the Birds Directive (Decree-Law 

n. 105/2012, Regulatory Decree n. 17/2015 and Decree-Law n. 204/2015). Although, this 

process was mainly aimed towards the designation of marine SPAs for the conservation of 

the following species: Puffinus mauretanicus, Oceanodroma castro, Morus bassanus, 

Melanitta nigra and Calonectris diomedea. Despite being a multi-species approach, most 

of the rare and non-threatened species were not considered in the analysis, which led to 

the definition of SPAs only in territorial sea (until 12nm). Consequently, no relevant 

offshore areas were found to be relevant for designation as marine SPAs. The recent 

publication of the Portuguese Atlas of Marine Birds (Meirinho et al. 2014) allows now 

considering all seabird species for the designation of SPAs offshore. This timely Atlas, 

presents the seasonal distributions of all seabird species that occur on Portuguese waters 

(Meirinho et al. 2014) and for most of the species it contains seasonal Spatial Distribution 

Models, based on a large set of environmental predictors, therefore being an useful tool 

for marine spatial planning and management. Data collection protocols allowed gathering 

information with a good temporal and spatial resolution encompassing a relatively large 

study period (December 2004 to December 2012). SDMs were developed using MaxEnt 

software, which is now considered to be a common SDM tool, as it is very simple to use 

and is especially efficient in handling complex iterations between response and predictor 

variables (Elith et al. 2006, 2010; Fourcade et al. 2014). 

The purpose of SDMs, and in particular of predictive mapping, is to provide spatially explicit 

information on species and other elements of biodiversity for conservation planning. Grid-

based atlases of species distribution have been widely used to collect data on distribution 

of different species, especially birds and can be used to obtain information about species-



 76 

environment relationships using these type of quantitative models. These studies have the 

advantage of using systematic methodologies to collect data about species distributions 

(Franklin 2010), hence the protocols can be replicated at different times, allowing to 

conduct long term monitoring studies. In recent years a novel approach to developing 

SDM’s has been gaining attention due to its integrative model: Spatial Conservation 

Planning (SCP). This is a multidisciplinary approach that relies on inputs from several fields, 

such as spatial ecology, economy, geography or sociology and aims to identify important 

areas for biodiversity and efficiently achieve conservation goals (Lindenmayer &amp;amp; Hunter 

2010; Reyers et al. 2010; Kukkala &amp;amp; Moilanen 2013). One of the most important steps in 

SCP is termed “spatial conservation prioritization”. This step requires the use of decision 

support systems and planning software, based on complex mathematical algorithms, to 

identify important areas for conservation or protected network expansion (Pressey &amp;amp; 

Bottrill 2009; Kukkala &amp;amp; Moilanen 2013). There are several decision support systems and 

planning software available to select areas with good habitat quality and connectivity. One 

such software frequently used is Zonation which includes a set of useful features, most 

noticeably allows for uncertainty analysis, species weighting and seven ways of dealing 

with connectivity (Lehtomäki &amp;amp; Moilanen 2013).  

 

In this study, we develop a spatial conservation prioritization for marine birds across 

mainland Portuguese Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), in preparation of eventual future 

expansion of the current conservation area networks and definition of MPAs, as well as, for 

the implementation of management plans on currently established SPAs. Our approach is 

based on decision-theoretic and optimization techniques, specifically using Zonation 

spatial planning software (Lehtomäki et al. 2009; Kukkala &amp;amp; Moilanen 2013). The main 

innovation in this technique is the multi-specific approach that aggregates seasonal SDMs 

for a large number of marine bird species occurring on the study area (common, rare, 

threatened and not-threatened) and the ability to combine these for identifying important 

conservation areas both offshore, in-shore, seasonally and overall.

Methods 

 

Data Collection 

Survey data was collected following the protocols developed for Portuguese Atlas of 

Marine Birds (for details see Meirinho et al. 2014). In short, from December 2004 to 

December 2012 ship-board surveys were conducted off the coast of Portugal and western 

Andalusia, broadly between 34°N and 42°N, and 6°W and 14°W. Most of the survey effort 

was carried out between March and November of each year, with fewer surveys from 

December through February. Standard protocols of European Seabirds at Sea data 

collection were used (Tasker et al. 1984; Camphuysen &amp;amp; Garthe 2004) on board four similar 

research vessels. All seabirds in contact with water within 300 m of the survey transect 

were counted on one side of the ship, and all flying seabirds were counted using the ‘snap-

shot method’, with bird observations summed over 5 min periods.  

 

 

Environmental predictors 

 

To model seabird species distribution, 19 environmental variables were selected (Table 10). 

These variables are either known, or expected, to be ‘usually’ correlated with seabird 

distribution and abundance (e.g. Louzao et al. 2006; Tremblay et al. 2009a, 2009b; 

Wakefield et al. 2009). The oceanographic data were obtained from Bloom-Watch 180, as 

remote sensing products (i.e. satellite imagery). Physical variables (e.g. bathymetry) were 

extracted only once since they are static over the study period. Dynamic oceanographic 

variables (e.g. Sea Surface Temperature – sst) were extracted as monthly averages, from 

Aqua MODIS and Pathfinder AVHRR satellite imagery, and varied among seasons and years 

during the study period.  



 78 

The effect of environmental variables on ocean productivity is not immediate, as in many 

cases there is a delay between some oceanographic phenomenon and prey occurrence. In 

order to account for productivity time lags we integrated Sea Surface (sst) and Chlorophyll 

a Concentration (chla) over a period of three months prior to each season: Winter, Spring, 

Summer and Autumn (Louzao et al. 2009). To account for annual anomalies we included 

the sst and chla anomalies (i.e. asst and achla) for each season, calculated as the difference 

between the average value for a given season and year and the average for that season 

over a 20-year period in that grid cell. Given that seabirds may respond to spatial gradients 

of oceanographic variables (Louzao et al. 2006; Tremblay et al. 2009a; Wakefield et al. 

2009), we also calculated spatial sst and chla gradients as: (maximum value x minimum 

value) x 100/maximum value; with maximum being the highest and minimum the lowest 

seasonal mean sst or chla value over a moving 3 x 3 grid cell window (i.e. 144km2). This 

dimensionless metric expresses the magnitude of change in each habitat variable, scaled 

to the maximum value. The spatial gradients of chlorophyll a (gchla) and sea surface 

temperature (gsst) indicate the presence of frontal systems, whereas the gradient of 

bathymetry (gbat) reflects the presence of topographic features (e.g. shelf break or 

seamount). Finally, we used the sla in each season as an indicator of mesoscale structures 

that mix additional nutrients up into to the surface layer.  

To evaluate the persistence of productive zones in the study area, we used chlorophyll a 

concentration datasets for the study period. Global persistency was calculated in 2 steps: 

1) for any given year, in each seasonal chla map (3 months), we identified cells with high 

nutrient concentration (chla &gt; 1 mg m3); 2) for each pixel, we counted the number of 

seasonal maps with high nutrient concentration. 

Environmental variables considered in the analytical process are shown in Table 10.

Species Distribution Modelling  

 
Data processing and exploratory analysis  

All observations were binned into a spatial grid with cell size 4km (0.0417°) to match the 

spatial resolution of remotely sensed environmental data. Every grid cell received an 

additional binary detection/non-detection value of ‘1’ (hereafter referred to as ‘presence’), 

whereas grid cells that were surveyed but where no target seabird species were observed 

were coded as ‘0’ (hereafter referred to as ‘absence’). 

 

Model construction  

Model construction, training and testing was performed with Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) 

modelling based on presence-only data (version 3.3.3 (http://www.cs. 

princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/ [accessed 18 October 2012]). MaxEnt is a general-

purpose method for characterizing probability distributions from incomplete information. 

In estimating the probability distribution defining a species’ distribution across a study 

area, MaxEnt formalizes the principle that the estimated distribution must agree with 

everything that is known (or inferred from the environmental conditions where the species 

has been observed), but should avoid making any assumptions that are not supported by 

the data. The approach is thus to find the probability distribution of maximum entropy (the 

distribution that is most spread-out, or closest to uniform) subject to constraints imposed 

by the information available regarding the observed distribution of the species and 

environmental conditions across the study area.  

The MaxEnt method does not require absence data for the species being modelled; instead 

it uses background environmental data for the entire study area. The method can use both 

continuous and categorical variables and the output is a continuous prediction (i.e. a 

cumulative probability ranging from 0 to 1 that indicates relative suitability).  

 



 81 

 

Model evaluation and calibration  

We divided the survey data into training and test datasets by setting aside approximately 

30% of the surveyed area for spatial evaluation of the models (Araújo &amp;amp; Guisan 2006). We 

first ran MaxEnt on the presence-only positions 100 times and then calculated the mean of 

the 100 MaxEnt predictions, to obtain an average prediction and coefficient of variation of 

those predictions. MaxEnt program was run separately for different species and seasons 

(i.e. winter, spring, summer, autumn). The settings were: logistic output format, resulting 

in values between 0 and 1 for each grid cell, where higher values indicate more similar 

climatic conditions; duplicates removed; and 100 replicate runs of random (bootstrap) 

subsamples with 30 as random test percentage. The results were summarized as the 

average of the 100 models. There are three main results of MaxEnt; jackknife chart, 

Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (ROC) and probability map. Jackknife chart was 

used to evaluate the contribution of each environmental layer to the final result, thus 

providing the explanatory power of each variable when used in isolation. The ROC curve 

describes the model’s accuracy measured by the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). The 

AUC estimates the likelihood that a randomly selected presence point is located in a raster 

cell with a higher probability value for species occurrence than a randomly generated point 

(Phillips et al. 2006). Generated models are generally interpreted as excellent for test AUC 

&gt; 0.90, good for 0.80 &amp;lt;AUC &amp;lt;0.90, acceptable for 0.70 &amp;lt;AUC &amp;lt;0.80, bad for 0.60 &amp;lt;AUC &amp;lt;

0.70 and invalid for 0.50 &amp;lt;AUC &amp;lt;0.60 (Araújo et al. 2005). All model evaluation statistics 

and optimal thresholds were calculated using the package ‘PresenceAbsence’ in R 2.15. (R 

Development Core Team 2012). Finally, the probability map shows the spatial distribution 

of predicted presence probability and is used for graphical representation of the 

distribution data.

Spatial prioritization  

 
In the second phase of this analysis, we used Zonation 4.0.0 to perform a spatial 

prioritization analysis, based on statistical seasonal seabird distributions models, to identify 

relevant marine conservation areas. Zonation is based on the specification of priorities and 

connectivity responses for biodiversity features (Moilanen 2007; Leathwick et al. 2008). 

Zonation algorithm starts by assuming that the full landscape is protected, and proceeds 

by progressively identifying and removing cells that cause the smallest marginal loss in 

conservation value. Low conservation cells are removed first, leaving high conservation grid 

cells to last, which correspond to the important conservation areas (Moilanen 2007; 

Moilanen et al. 2014). The first and most important part of the analysis is the meta-

algorithm selection, which will define the marginal loss. Here, we used the Core Area 

Zonation (CAZ) meta-algorithm. CAZ aims to ensure high-quality locations for all species, 

including those that occur in otherwise species poor areas (Leathwick et al. 2008; 

Lehtomäki &amp;amp; Moilanen 2013). Therefore, CAZ it is able to identify as high-priority areas that 

have a high occurrence level for a single rare and/or highly weighted feature (Minin et al. 

2014). Succinctly CAZ uses the following principles: (1) of two otherwise equal locations, 

that with a lower occurrence for the most important species is removed first; (2) assuming 

two otherwise equal locations, that with the occurrence of a lower-weight species is 

removed before that with an equal occurrence for a high-priority species; (3) assuming two 

identical locations with identical original occurrence levels for two different species, the 

one retained is that which contains a species that has lost more of its distribution; (4) of 

two otherwise identical locations, that with higher cost is removed first (Moilanen 2007; 

Leathwick et al. 2008; Moilanen et al. 2014). 

Species were assigned with different priority weights, based on their national conservation 

status (Table 11) and their phenology in the study area (Table 12). We attributed a score to 

each of the categories of these 2 criteria, as shown in. For each species, overall weights 

were calculated by multiplying the 2 scores (Supplementary Material C).

Methods for reserve selection and conservation planning often ignore uncertainty. For 

example, presence-absence observations and predictions of habitat models are used as 

inputs but commonly assumed to be without error. But zonation provides an uncertainty 

analysis feature aiming at robust conservation decisions (Moilanen et al. 2006b, 2014). 

Uncertainty analysis provides a consistent framework for understanding potential 

consequences of errors in inputs and achieve a given conservation target, despite 

uncertainty in data. Zonation applies one particular branch of decision theory, information-

gap theory, to conservation planning based on probabilities of occurrence. The underlying 

method is the “distribution discounting”, in which the site- and species-specific measure of 

conservation value (related to species-specific occupancy probabilities) was penalized by 

an error measure (in our study, related to accuracy of statistical prediction) (Moilanen et 

al. 2006a, 2006b).  



 84 

 

For each seasonal species distribution model, a corresponding uncertainty map was 

calculated on MaxEnt. These uncertainty layers represent the Standard Deviation (SD) of 

the probability of occurrence estimates.  

 

We selected Zonation to perform a spatial priority rank analysis for each season (Spring, 

Summer, Autumn and Winter). The informative layers used in this spatial analysis include, 

for each season, a total of 34 (Spring), 22 (Summer), 34 (Autumn) and 20 (Winter) seasonal 

species predictive and uncertainty maps obtained with MaxEnt (seasonal species maps are 

available online at http://www.atlasavesmarinhas.pt/ for detailed information on species 

occurrence).  

We carried out four analyses that identified seasonal high priority conservation areas for 

seabirds across mainland Portugal. The spatial area considered for this study includes the 

continental Portuguese EEZ (offshore area), territorial and interior waters (inshore area). 

We then used the seasonal results to identify high priority offshore areas for seabird 

conservation, by extracting the results using an offshore area mask. We then combined the 

4 seasonal solutions in a mosaic raster by selecting the blend option in ArcGIS 10.3 mosaic 

to new raster tool.  

To identify the best offshore areas for seabird conservation, we selected the 10% Top 

Fraction of the combined final solution. According with Lehtomäki &amp;amp; Moilanen (2013) the 

best top fraction values to identify the best areas for conservation typically varies between 

2% and 20%. We selected an intermediate value in this range that outputted satisfactory 

results and ensures that these areas contain a balanced representation of all features 

(habitat type and/or species distributions) included in the analysis (Kremen et al. 2008; 

Lehtomäki &amp;amp; Moilanen 2013).

Results 

 
The generic results allowed to identify four seasonal high priority conservation areas for 

seabirds across mainland Portugal. The seasonal results are presented in priority rank 

maps, shown in Figure 7. For better visualization of seasonal results, the four maps show 

the wider distribution of the best areas for conservation identified by the highest-ranked 

cells in the 20% top fraction. These generic results are the baseline analysis, based on 

seasonal multispecies distribution datasets and on a well supported analysis 

parameterization which accounts for predictive uncertainty.

Discussion 

 

Spatial planning in the marine environment is a relatively recent management activity, 

when compared with land use planning (Peel &amp;amp; Lloyd 2004; Douvere &amp;amp; Ehler 2009).  The 

overexploitation and the increase of human pressure on marine environment has amplified 

the need to identify and conserve important ecosystems at sea (Smith et al. 2014). 

Implementation of efficient MPAS, management plans and conservation actions for 

seabirds demands robust information on species distribution during each phenological 

stage of its life cycle. Furthermore, important seabird areas constitute valuable information 

toward marine conservation efforts, as they can be indicative of productivity hotspots for 

a diversity of life, including primary producers, invertebrates, fish, and/or marine mammals 

(Piatt et al. 2007; Suryan et al. 2012). Marine IBAs can therefore provide a starting point 

for establishing legal protections, such as MPAs or SPAs, because they are designed using 

observational data and a standardized global criteria (Nur et al. 2011; Ronconi &amp;amp; Clair 2012; 

Lascelles et al. 2012). In addition, IBA data can have both regional and global applications, 

such as environmental assessment, design of best management practices, or broad-scale 

integrative marine spatial planning. 

 

Analytical issues 

 
Our approach clearly reflects the utility of a spatial planning tool like Zonation. The selected 

workflow allowed to integrate a considerable amount of information on seabird 

distributions, at broad spatial and temporal scales, to provide a simple, balanced and 

objective identification of the most relevant areas for conservation. The final framework is 

a well-justified proposal for expansion of the existing SPAs network, as well as a valuable 

contribution for future implementation of MPAs in Portugal. 

 

Three major aspects stand out from Figure 9. First, the importance of continental shelf 

areas, especially along Nazaré-Minho area and off Cape Raso Coast. Seabirds usually show 



 89 

a numerical response in relation to food availability (Schreiber &amp;amp; Burger 2002) . Shelf edge 

areas, north of Nazaré are highly productive offshore areas, due to upwelling systems and 

oceanographical fronts that can support large numbers of seabirds. The attraction of 

seabirds to these edge areas may also be related with fisheries effort and fishery discards. 

Trawlers persistently operate along the shelf, attracting large numbers of offal-eating 

seabirds. So, migratory and breeding seabirds in this region, benefit from human fisheries 

in the area, by foraging on food items that would otherwise be unavailable to them.  

 

Second, the importance of a group of 3 offshore areas encompassing: the abyssal plain 

between Porto Seamount and S. Pedro canyon; the area north of Carvalho Araújo Trough; 

the area Estremadura Spur and Duarte Pacheco Spur. These 3 areas present high diversity 

of geological formations, like canyons, seamounts and abyssal plains. Though, the most 

relevant aspect is that these 3 areas are all associated with smoother slopes zones and 

more moderate continental shelf rise than other continental shelf areas. During Autumn 

and Winter, this group of 3 areas is influenced by WIWiFs, Western Iberia Winter Fronts. 

 

The third area shown in this Figure is the Gorringe Ridge-Ampère Seamount area. This is a 

well known region characterized for its high productivity, due to the influence of the ACEB, 

Azores Current Eastern Branch, and biodiversity (ICNF 2015). 

 

Implications for marine conservation planning in Portuguese cont inental 
waters 

 

Understanding the patterns of seabird distribution is crucial to the definition of MPAs 

(Amorim et al. 2009), but the identification of truly oceanic important areas for seabirds is 

still a challenge (Arcos et al. 2012). Most often the spatial planning for seabird conservation 

focus on protection of breeding areas with much less attention  given to feeding, resting, 

migratory and wintering areas (Amorim et al. 2009). In this work, we followed a workflow 

that allowed to identify relevant areas for conservation of marine bird diversity on 

Portuguese offshore waters (Lehtomäki et al. 2009; Lehtomäki &amp;amp; Moilanen 2013), not 

relevant as breeding areas, but important as feeding, resting, migratory and wintering 



 90 

grounds for migratory and highly mobile species. The output areas can be considered as an 

ecologically well-justified proposal for future implementation of MPAs and expansion of 

the current marine Natura 2000 network outside the Portuguese territorial waters.  

 

Our results address many of the planning needs Portugal has for the marine environment. 

Recent SPA designation focused on designation of protected areas on territorial waters 

excluded offshore areas. This work shows that there is a necessity for designating 

protection areas in non-coastal zones, which are also ecologically important for seabirds 

during their annual life cycle. Some of the identified key areas are in regions thought to be 

important for marine biodiversity, due to their environmental characteristics (e.g. Gorringe 

Bank). Indeed, the majority of IBAs are associated with physical features that influence 

productivity and/or cause upwelling and mixing (Smith et al. 2014; Lascelles et al. 2016). 

Other proposed areas are located on the border of the EEZ and the territorial waters’ limit. 

Some of the proposed areas can be consider an extension of current nearshore SPAs. 

 

These results are also very relevant to undertake in the future best practice management 

actions, aimed at identifying potential conflict areas with anthropogenic activities and 

minimize their impacts. In general, fisheries are considered to be the major conflictive 

activity with marine biodiversity conservation (Croxall et al. 2012). But on offshore areas 

there are several other pressures that might affect species ecological niches (Lascelles et 

al. 2016). For instance, recent prospection for oil and gas in offshore areas of the 

Portuguese EEZ can lead to the development of drilling infrastructures in the near future. 

Seabirds are also very sensitive to marine traffic and pollution (Croxall et al. 2012; Winiarski 

et al. 2014; Lascelles et al. 2016) which is likely to increase. Therefore, there is a crucial 

need to understand the environmental factors driving the distribution of marine birds and 

other species in the region and implement a robust SCP approach, based on well set 

conservation objectives. Specific conservation actions should also be integrated in a larger 

national management plan in order to consider the flux of individuals and populations 

between distinct MPAs.

General Discussion 

 

This thesis investigates the movements and distribution of pelagic and neritic seabirds and 

uses modelling approaches to identify the environmental factors that affect their spatial 

occurrence. From this work, it is clear that overall productivity parameters (SST and Chlo-

a) are good predictors of species presence (Chapter 2 and 3), most likely due to their link 

with availability of resources, whilst species ecology and seasonality making other variables 

contributing differently for a given species at a given time (e.g. “distance to colony” in the 

breeding season). Although inter-specific variation is expected and should be considered 

when designing conservation measurements, intra-specific variation is also quite relevant 

particularly between the sexes, which might have distinct requirements (Chapter 3). 

Predictive models are only as good in their ability to produce valuable outcomes as the data 

that is inputted into them. It is therefore paramount to collect good quality empirical data 

and to process environmental data with the highest definition possible (also considering 

the tracking resolution) and most importantly to select an adequate modelling approach to 

the datasets (Chapter 4). Final decision making process in which to select which areas 

should be designated for protection status can be supported with prioritization techniques 

(Chapter4), and the methods show here can be of great for the conservation of marine 

systems.  

 

 

Monitoring seabird spatial distribution s 

 

Understanding seabird spatial ecology, habitat preferences and movement patterns in 

pelagic areas is a task usually hampered by logistic and financial constraints (Ramírez et al. 

2008). The most common study methods are ship-based or aerial censuses or individual 



 100 

remote tracking, using data-loggers. There is a wide array of devices useful for seabird 

tracking (e.g. platform terminal transmitters (PTT) or acoustic telemetry tags), that can be 

combined with other technologies (e.g. accelerometers, depthmeters or temperature 

sensors) to better understand individual behaviour or measure environmental parameters 

of the selected habitats (Wilson et al. 2007; BirdLife International 2009).Positioning 

technology, precision, total device weight, attachment method, waterproofness, battery 

capacity, availability of solar panel recharge or remote data transmission (and type of 

technology used to do so) are some of the aspects that have to be taken into account when 

defining study species, experimental design, spatiotemporal resolutions and ecological 

questions to be addressed in seabird tracking studies (Wilson &amp;amp; Vandenabeele 2012; Hunt 

&amp;amp; Wilson 2012). 

The results obtained in Chapter 2, based on remote tracking data of individuals of both  

species of Giant Petrels, using Geolocators (GLS), highlights the usefulness of this 

technology for predictive distribution studies, projected to macro (1000-3000Km2) or 

mega-scales (&gt;3000 Km2) (BirdLife International 2009) and aimed to cover species annual 

life cycles. The major drawbacks of this technology are its low precision (100-200 km, 

(Phillips et al. 2004))  , since it is based on light readings that can be sometimes erroneous 

due to external effects and/or animal behaviour; and the fact that the bird has to be caught 

a second time for tag removal as this are loggers and require data downloading. Given the 

fact that it only allows to calculate two positions per day, and its low energy consumption 

rates, GLS are more suited for long term tracking, for instances to study migration ecology 

or seasonal differences in habitat use (Chapter 2). 

Technological advances made Global Positioning System (GPS) devices widely available and 

more affordable for wildlife studies. Combined with other technologies like GSM/GPRS and 

supplied with solar charging capacity, it is now possible to use GPS on medium or long-term 

tracking studies, benefitting from its high spatiotemporal resolution capabilities and 

precision, and also allowing to remotely retrieve data in an automated process. The 

GPS/GSM system used on Chapter 3 of this thesis to track individuals of Audouin’s Gull 

during the breeding season required the adaptation of several commercial technologies to 

develop an entirely novel solution for long-term seabird tracking. These new transmitters 



 101 

were successfully used for the first time on a seabird and it enabled the longest tracking of 

this species so far anywhere in the world. This achievement allowed acquiring totally novel 

information regarding the species distribution during the entire breeding period. The new 

transmitters applied to seabirds (and developed in collaboration with members of 

CEABN/CIBIO) open new avenues of research for this group of species given the relatively 

low cost of these tags in relation to similar options currently commercially available.   

 

Advantages of long -term monitoring schemes and multi -taxa approaches 

for Spatial Conservati on Planning (SCP) 

 

The integrative approach of incorporating multi-year data of species occurrence, available 

from long-term monitoring schemes, on predictive modelling and spatial prioritization 

procedures, using a temporal scale that splits the annual cycle in several seasons (Chapter 

4), is a solution to incorporate stochastic inter-annual variations between homologous 

seasons in the Spatial Conservation Planning process, thus reflecting the dynamic nature 

of the marine environment. At the same time, this approach also allows to better 

understand intra-annual differences in space use by seabirds. 

 

Optimal design of a protected area intended to conserve a given population would need to 

encompass that population’s entire year-round distribution. While it may be possible to 

accomplish such a design for some resident or non-migratory species (Reeves 2000), the 

ranges of most seabird populations are often be too large for this to be practicable. Also, 

effectiveness of marine protected areas depends on their ability to protect different life 

stages and distributional ranges (nesting, feeding, and migrating grounds), as vulnerability 

of a population may be habitat and stage specific (Hooker &amp;amp; Gerber 2004; Yorio 2009). The 

inclusion, as much as possible, in the SCP process (Chapter 4) of distribution data for 

common and occasional, migratory and resident, threatened and least concern species, 

although with different relative weights in the spatial prioritization analysis performed, 

reflects the aim of minimizing the risk of not identifying important areas for seabirds in the 

final results. 



 102 

The long-term and multi-taxa approaches allowed to obtain a more comprehensive picture 

of ecosystem’s reality in the Chapter 4 results. 

 

 

Spatiotemporal flexib ility of marine protected areas networks  

 

Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been proposed and used as a tool for seabird 

conservation worldwide (Duffy 1994 Hyrenbach et al. 2000; Yorio 2000, 2009; Wienecke &amp;amp; 

Robertson 2002; Airame et al. 2003; Garthe &amp;amp; Skov 2006; Lombard et al. 2007). To date 

there have been relatively few Natura 2000 sites identified for the offshore marine 

environment and this represents the most significant gap in the Natura 2000 network 

(European Commission 2007). Therefore, Chapter 4 of this thesis presents itself as case 

study in the European context and contribution to address this problem. 

 

Scientific studies and technical guidelines suggest that boundaries of MPAs in open sea 

should be flexible enough to adapt to the range shifts of nutrients (Hooker &amp;amp; Gerber 2004; 

European Commission 2007; Claudet 2011; Ruiz-Frau et al. 2015), organisms and water 

masses, especially when MPAs focal species of concern are as highly mobile as seabirds, 

whose spatial distribution is more affected by prey densities and oceanographic variables 

than static physical features, as bathymetry (unlike the cetaceans) (Hooker &amp;amp; Gerber 2004). 

 

A more adaptable proposal of MPAs boundaries definition accordingly with time of the 

year/phenology, using seasonal outputs from Spatial Conservation Planning processes (as 

presented in Figure 9, Chapter 4) could contribute to minimize the problem of MPAs 

inefficiency to effectively protect highly mobile seabird species. 

 

Even if some doubt still subsists on the efficiency of offshore MPAs, at least they may pose 

a legal and regulatory framework to human activities, fact that is directly relevant for 

seabird conservation (Lascelles et al. 2012; Perrow et al. 2015).
