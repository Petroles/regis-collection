Abstract. Intense cyclonic weather systems in southern Brazil generate ocean storms which can, 
in a temporal scale varying from few hours to a day completely erode a beach profile from its 
maximum accretion state. Mid-latitude cyclogenesis with low pressure centers in the deep ocean 
and along the coast increases the intensity of the Mid-Atlantic storms causing storm surges and 
storm waves. Preliminary results from a hindcast of wave energy at deep water (100 m), 
performed with a wave model using winds from reanalysis ( period 1979 - 2008), indicated a total 
of 40 extreme events (wave height above 6 m). These events cause maximum erosion and surge 
elevation on the order of 62.96m³/m and 1.827 m respectively. Four patterns of synoptic situations 
capable of generating extreme events were identified. Among the 40 events, 53.66% had the 
trajectory of Pattern II and 26.82% were associated to Pattern III, representing both 80% of the 
total. Coastal erosion episodes where mostly associated with Pattern II, while Pattern III caused 
the highest surges. In a climate change scenario this study shows no important differences in the 
amount of the extreme events along the last thirty years.

Introduction 
After the accretion period which occurs 

between December and March, storms beginning in 
April start the erosion cycle of the southern 
Brazilian sandy beaches. Generally, erosion is 

caused by extreme sea state events which combine 
high waves and high storm surges. Since 
astronomical tides have higher amplitude in this 
region during April, and the storms can last a few

days, it is not uncommon that episodes of severe 
erosion occur during the high water spring tide 
period (Calliari et al. 1998). These storms are mostly 
associated with high intensity extra-tropical cyclones 
that generate wind waves which can change a beach 
profile from its maximum accretion state to 
complete erosion during a period that can vary from 
few hours to a few days. 

Regarding the occurrence of extra-tropical 
Cyclones in South America, Gan (1992), analyzing 
10 years of data (from 1979 to 1988) has found that 
the majority of events happen in winter (8 events), 
followed by autumn (6), spring (4) and summer (3). 
Gan &amp;amp; Rao (1991) identified two cyclogenesis 
regions in South America: one in Argentina (42.5° S 
and 62.5° W) related to the baroclinic instability of 
the westerly winds and another in Uruguay (31.5° S 
and 55° W) associated with the baroclinic instability 
due to the presence of the Andes. Recently, a third 
region between 20° and in the 35°S located in 
southern and south-eastern Brazil was identified 
(Reboita et al. 2010). 

Mid-latitude cyclogenesis with low pressure 
centers in the deep ocean and along the coast 
increases the intensity of Mid-Atlantic storms 
causing extreme storm surges and storm waves 
(Calliari et al. 1998). The “surge” in a specific 
instant is represented by the difference between the 
observed and the astronomical tide and can be either 
positive or negative causing rapid increase or 
decrease in sea level, respectively (Pugh 1987). 

Storm surges are the major geological risk in 
low coastal areas. They are often associated with 
significant losses of life and property. Climate 
change, with rising sea level and changing storm 
tracks, will modify the regional distributions of these 
hazards (von Storch &amp;amp; Woth 2008). 

The two main sources of storm surges are: 
changes in atmospheric pressure and the exchange of 
momentum between the wind and the sea surface. In 
general, the effects associated with atmospheric 
pressure is less than 10% of the total, being the wind 
shear stress at the sea surface the main component 
(Marone &amp;amp; Camargo1994). Additionally, sea level 
elevations at the shore can be further amplified by 
the presence of shelf waves and by the pilling up of 
water due to wave breaking processes at the surf 
zone (known as “wave set up”) (Marone &amp;amp; Camargo 
1994). 

Observations of synoptic weather conditions 
and sea level elevation done by Parise et al. (2009) 
showed that the highest sea level elevation events 
resulted from the action of SW winds which blow 
parallel to the main NE-SW coastline orientation in 
the region, a result that can be explained by the 

pilling up of water at the coast due to the Coriolis 
effect (i.e. Ekman transport). The monitoring carried 
out by Saraiva et al. (2003) from April 1997 to July 
1999 on Cassino Beach indicated the highest 
frequency of the storm surge in autumn (65%), 
followed by similar values in summer and spring 
(15%) and lower values in winter (5%). All the 
storm surges observed by Saraiva et al. (2003) were 
associated with extra-tropical cyclones. 

Coastal erosion has been causing substantial 
alterations along the coastline of the Rio Grande do 
Sul (RS) state in southern Brazil for quite some 
time. In the less occupied areas in the central littoral, 
coastal erosion caused habitat loss of foredune 
ridges and inflicted local damage to a lighthouse 
(Conceição lighthouse) and small beach resorts at 
Lagamarzinho beach (Barletta &amp;amp; Calliari 2003). In 
more developed regions of the northern littoral, such 
as Cidreira, Tramandaí and Imbé beaches, coastal 
erosion is aggravating, leading to severe loss of 
public and private property (Esteves et al. 2000, 
Toldo Jr. et al. 1993). At the southern littoral, 
Hermenegildo beach, located near the Uruguayan 
border, has had homes, roads and power lines 
systematically destroyed (Calliari et al. 1998, 
Esteves et al. 2000). Additionally, in several 
stretches of the RS coastline, beach erosion causes 
exposure of peat and muddy lagoonal outcrops 
leading to a decrease in the quality of beach 
recreation (Calliari et al. 1998) (Fig. 1). 

In a climate change scenario, the present 
study aims at assessing in detail the synoptic 
situations that give rise to extreme sea state events in 
Southern Brazil and determining trends in the 
atmospheric patterns and path lines of 
meteorological systems associated with them. The 
erosional impact on the coastline and the storm 
surges caused by these extreme events are also 
investigated. Case studies of selected extreme events 
that generated strong beach erosion are also 
discussed in detail. 
 
Materials and Methods 
Extreme events 

In the absence of sufficiently long data sets, 
we had to resort to numerical models to infer the 
occurrence of extreme events. The results used 
herein were extracted from a comprehensive study 
that is being currently carried out by the third author 
and are still preliminary (see Melo et al. 2010). In 
that on-going study, the wave generation model 
Wave Watch III (WW3) (Tolman 2002) forced with 
reanalysis winds from NCEP (National Centers for 
Environmental Prediction) was used to reconstruct 
sea state conditions off the southern Brazilian coast

from 1979 to 2008. “Extreme” events were then 
selected based on the criteria that the reconstructed 
significant wave height (Hs) at a point in 100 m 
depth off Rio Grande city exceeded the 6 m mark. 
Preliminary results indicated that a total of 40 
extreme events occurred in the studied period. 

 
Synoptic scenarios associated with extreme events 

The reanalysis dataset was created through 
the cooperative efforts of the NCEP and NCAR 
(National Center for Atmospheric Research) (Kalnay 
et al. 1996) to produce relatively high-resolution 
global analyses of atmospheric fields over a long 
time period. The reanalysis dataset (R-1 of NCEP / 
NCAR) was used to characterize atmospheric 
conditions that originated these 40 extreme events. 

To do so, meridional and zonal components of the 
wind and atmospheric pressure at the 995 mbar level 
were used. For both a spatial resolution of 2.5° x 
2.5°, and a temporal resolution of 6 hours (0000, 
0600, 1200, 1800 UTC) restricted between 60°S - 
15°S and 90°W - 20°W was adopted. In order to 
better characterize the path of the systems that 
generated extreme events, a threshold vorticity lesser 
or equal than (?10) -5 x 10-5s-1 was adopted. The 
reanalysis dataset is available at site 
www.cdc.noaa.gov 

 
Data analysis 

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to 
verify differences between the numbers of events at 
3 years interval along the 30 years. Data normality

was tested through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test 
and the homogeneity of the same ones through the 
Levene test (Zar 1999). 

 
Results and Discussion 

In the period between the years of 1979 and 
2008, 40 events of significant wave height (Hs) 
above 6 m occurred considering as reference the 
position of (32°54’S, 50°48’W) at 100 m water 
depth. The yearly mean number of events was 1.33 
with a minimum of 0 events and a maximum of 4 
events in the year of 1999. The standard deviation 
was 0.958/year. 

The ANOVA result of the 10 groups joined 
at 3 years interval shows no significant difference in 
the number of extreme wave height events along the 
30 years period (F(9, 20) = 1.4815, p = 0.22141  
(Fig. 2A). The correlation graphic between the 
numbers of events and the thirty 30 years period 
showed a positive but weak correlation (r = 0.30636) 
(Fig. 2B).

Webster et al. (2005) found an increase in 
the number of tropical cyclones and cyclone days as 
well as tropical cyclone intensity over the past 35 
years, in an environment of increasing sea surface 
temperature. A large increase was seen in the 
number and proportion of hurricanes reaching 
categories 4 and 5. The largest increase occurred in 
the North Pacific, Indian, and Southwest Pacific 
Oceans, and the smallest occurred in the North 
Atlantic Ocean. 

From the analysis of the meteorological 
scenarios, four patterns of synoptic situations 
capable of generating extreme events were identified 
(Fig. 3): 
• PATTERN I: Cyclogenesis in the southern 
Argentinean coast with a displacement to the east 
and a trajectory between 47.5°S and 57.5°S; 
• PATTERN II: Cyclogenesis in the southern 
Uruguayan coast with a displacement to the east and 
a trajectory between 28ºS and 43°S; 
• PATTERN III: Cyclogenesis in the southern 
Uruguayan coast with a displacement to the 
southeast and a trajectory between 32°S and 57.5°S; 
• PATTERN IV: High-pressure center generating 
an easterly wind. 
 

Was not observed at the study area a 
significant difference in the frequency of the  
patterns of cyclone trajectories along time. The 
pattern with the greatest number of extreme events 
was Pattern II with 22 of the 40 +1 events. Eleven 
(11) events were associated with Pattern III and four 
(4) events were associated to both Pattern I and IV. 
The value of 41 related to the sum of all the patterns 
is due to an event that occurred on 07/21/1996, in 
which, two parallel extra-tropical cyclones 
resembling Patterns I and II occurred simulta-
neously. 

 
Case Studies 

In this section, a selection of extreme sea 
state events was used to assess both, the specific 
meteorological scenarios associated, and the 
response that was observed on the coast in terms of 
beach erosion. 

 
July 21th, 1996 

An extreme wave height event occurred on 
July 21th, 1996. The meteorological scenario shows 
two extra-tropical cyclones parallel to each other 
representing Patterns I and II. Due to its eastern path 
and the following of a high pressure system in the 
rear, a long southwest wind fetch of more than 3000 
km was formed over the Atlantic off the South 
American coast (Fig. 4).

This event caused the maximum erosion 
profiles recorded in 1996. At places located between 
Solidão and Estreito lighthouses the maximum 
eroded volume reached 62.96 m³/m (Barletta &amp;amp; 
Calliari 2003) (Fig. 5). 
 
April 18th, 1999 

The meteorological scenario on this extreme 
event was unusual since the path of the cyclone that 
developed off the RS coast formed a loop without 
much forward motion (Fig. 6). 

Severe erosion was observed at Hermene- 
 

gildo beach. Prior to the storm, this beach resort had 
110 beachfront houses. During the storm, 22 houses 
were destroyed or highly damaged. This single 
storm was also able to destroy the majority of 
coastal protection structures including 20% of all 
beachfront houses. However, as it was later 
observed, all the coastal protection structures were 
built on top of the foredunes without any foundation 
underneath them, being, in this way, susceptible to 
undermining. Esteves et al. (2000) indicated that this 
was the process that caused most of the structures to 
collapse (Fig. 7).

May 25th, 2003 

This event was, actually, monitored by an 
oceanographic buoy moored offshore Rio Grande 
city (Minuano buoy from the PNBOIA, Program 
moored at a depth of 70 m) since it caused mud 
deposition at Cassino beach (Calliari &amp;amp; Faria 2003). 
Buoy measurements, which did not include 
direction, are displayed in Table I. Maximum 
significant wave height came very close to the 7 m 
mark. The path described by the extra-tropical 
cyclone on this event resembled Pattern II (Figure 
8A). A large low pressure center can be observed 
moving slowly towards the E (Fig. 8B). 
 
September 04th, 2006 

This event coincided with one of the extra-
tropical cyclones studied by Parise et al. (2009), 
who shows that this particular storm caused a surge 
of 1.827 m. Although the surge was very high, beach 
erosion was low (-8.14 m3/m) the reason being that 

the initial profile was already eroded by the winter 
storms. Regarding the meteorological scenario, it 
can be observed the development of a long wind 
fetch from S to SW (Fig. 9). The association 
between this wind pattern and the NE-SW 
orientation of the shoreline favored the extra high 
rise in sea level observed on the coast due to the 
Coriolis effect (Parise et al. 2009).

Video-images from an ARGUS system 

(Holman &amp;amp; Stanley 2007) analyzed before and after 
the onset of the extra-tropical cyclone allowed the 
quantification of changes in beach width at Cassino 
during the event (Parise et al. 2009) Timex images 
from the same system display the surge reaching the 
dunes and the differences of the surf zone width with 
a third bar appearing during the storm surge (Fig. 
10). Maximum values of storm surges of the order of 
1 m, 1.4 m and 1.9 m in the coast of the RS have 
been found by Calliari et al. (1998), Saraiva et al. 
(2003) and Parise et al. (2009), respectively. During 
this event great part of Cassino beach was flooded 
when the water reached the first avenue close to the 
beach. 

Studies done by Saraiva et al. (2003) and 
Parise et al. (2009) pointed out that the maximum 
elevation of the surge occurs mainly 24 hours after 
the cyclone formation (Tab. II).

Special Cases 

Among the 40 extreme wave height events, 
four were generated by strong easterly winds 
associated with large anticyclonic system, which 
also displays the path of the high-pressure center 
between March 04 and 05 of 1996. This event 
generated waves from the east quadrant as indicated 
by the wind field shown in figure 11. 
 
Conclusion 

This study shows no important differences 
in the amount of extreme events along the last thirty 
years. The mean number of events obtained was 
1.33 per year. To these events data of wind velocity 
and vorticity, atmospheric pressure and sea level 
elevation were added. Effects of extreme events on 

the coast caused maximum erosion and surge 
elevation on the order of 62.96m³/m and 1.827 m, 
respectively. 

Among the 40 events studied, 22 (53.66%) 
had the trajectory of Pattern II with Cyclogenesis to 
the south of the Uruguayan coast with a path to the 
east and a trajectory between 28°S and 43°S. 
Cyclones associated with Pattern III, represented 
26.82% (11 events). Those two types represent 80% 
of the total extreme events. The relationship between 
the coastal erosion and these extreme events is clear, 
as observed from Parise et al. (2009), being the 
cyclones associated with Pattern II the most erosive 
ones, whereas those associated with Pattern III the 
ones that cause highest surges. 

The reanalysis dataset of NCEP proved  
very useful in this type of analysis, because  
although the spacing of the data 2.5 degrees, 
cyclones and anticyclones studied have diameters 
above 1000 km, thus presenting a good answer  
to the synoptic situation that caused each extreme 
event studied.
