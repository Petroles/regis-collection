The influx of sediments carried by rivers can be measured continuously using a turbidimeter 
through the indirect relationship between turbidity and suspended sediment concentration 
(SSC). However, this process is dependent on obtaining water samples with suspended 
sediments to calibrate the turbidimeter. Sampling can be carried out through different 
methods, resulting in errors and uncertainties in estimating the SSC. Four different 
possibilities for the composition of the calibration curve were tested in order to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the turbidimeter calibration for different sampling strategies. The study was 
conducted in 2012 and 2013 in two catchments in southern Brazil that had a strong sediment 
yield impact. The results indicate that sampling during rainfall events generate a significant 
and representative SSC for the turbidimeter calibration. The use of an integrating sampler 
for synthetic samples provides an effective calibration, but overestimates SSC compared to 
calibration from rainfall event sampling. The samples collected at fixed intervals - weekly 
and daily - generated an insufficient amount of data and are not representative of real 
sediment concentrations of the catchments.

Estratégias de amostragem para estimar a concentração
de sedimentos em suspensão para a calibração do turbidímetro
R E S U M O
O fluxo de sedimentos em rios pode ser medido continuamente com o uso de turbidímetro, 
pela relação indireta entre turbidez da água e concentração de sedimentos em suspensão 
(CSS). Entretanto, isso é dependente da obtenção de amostras com sedimentos em 
suspensão para a calibração do turbidímetro, a qual pode ser realizada de diferentes 
formas, originando erros e incertezas na estimativa da CSS. No intuito de avaliar a eficácia 
de diferentes estratégias de amostragem para a calibração do turbidímetro foram testadas 
quatro diferentes possibilidades para a composição da curva de calibração. O trabalho foi 
realizado em duas bacias hidrográficas no sul do Brasil com forte impacto na produção de 
sedimentos entre 2012 e 2013. Os resultados indicam que a amostragem durante eventos 
gera uma quantidade significativa e representativa de valores de CSS para a calibração. O 
uso do amostrador integrador no tempo para a obtenção de amostras sintéticas permite 
uma boa estratégia de calibração, mas superestima os valores de CSS em relação à calibração 
com amostras de eventos. As amostras coletadas em intervalos fixos (semanais e diários) 
geram uma quantidade insuficiente de dados e não representativos das concentrações de 
sedimentos que ocorrem nas bacias.

885Sampling strategies to estimate suspended sediment concentration for turbidimeter calibration

R. Bras. Eng. Agríc. Ambiental, v.21, n.12, p.884-889, 2017.

Introduction

Turbidimetr y has been widely used for monitoring 
suspended solid discharges. It represents an additional and 
efficient option to overcome the limitations of traditional 
susp ende d s e diment concent rat ion (SSC) monitor ing 
(Pavanelli &amp;amp; Bigi, 2005). Turbidity is the transparency level of 
a solution that contains suspended and dissolved substances 
(Slaets et al., 2014) that causes light to be scattered instead of 
passing through the solution in a straight line. Thus, the higher 
the intensity of scattered light, the higher the turbidity level. 

Turbidimeter calibration with samples of suspended 
sediment representing the location is important because the 
spectral responses obtained by turbidity sensors have no 
universal connection with the SSC (Mylvaganam &amp;amp; Jakobsen, 
2001). The relationship between turbidity and SSC depends 
on the different characteristics of suspended sediment, such 
as grain size (Merten et al., 2014), color, and mineralogy of the 
sediments (Rai &amp;amp; Kumar, 2015). The particle size in transport 
varies with the hydraulic characteristics of the flow, erosive 
processes, geomorphological and lithological conditions of the 
catchment, and presence of vegetation (Slattery &amp;amp; Burt, 1997; 
Lenzi &amp;amp; Marchi, 2000). 

The same material that is transported by the flow must be 
used for the turbidimeter calibration, and the samples obtained 
must have the same amplitude of the SSC that may occur in 
the flow, to avoid the extrapolation of the calibration curve. 
This is main obstacle in a successful calibration. 

Different strategies have been employed to obtain SSC 
samples for turbidimeter calibration to overcome this 
problem (Minella et al., 2008), for example, use soil from the 
catchment, fine sediments collected from the deposits, and 
sediments transported during the rainfall events for calibration. 
According to Lewis (2002), sampling during various rainfall 
events is required due to differences that may exist among 
transported material from different rainfall events. 

D i f fe re nt  S S C  s ampl i ng  st r ate g i e s  we re  te ste d  for 
turbidimeter calibration to demonstrate the differences in 
SSC estimation, depending on how calibration samples were 
acquired. Sampling was carried out based on rainfall events 
with fixed schedules (daily and weekly), as well as use of 
time-integrated samplers. While taking into consideration 
the impact on monitoring costs and estimate quality, the 
convenience of using a time-integrated sampler and daily 
and weekly samplings were evaluated in comparison with the 
samples collected during the rainfall events.

Material and Methods

This study was conducted with turbidimeters monitoring 
gauge stations installed in the Conceição River (28° 27’ 22” S; 
53° 58’ 24” W) and in the Guaporé River (28° 54’ 41” S; 
51° 57’ 10” W) in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, southern 
Brazil (Figure 1), in 2012 and 2013. 

T h e  C on c e i ç ã o  c atch m e nt  h a s  a  d r ai n age  are a  of 
approximately 800 km2 and is characterized by dairy farming 
and grain production. The annual average precipitation in the 

region is 1,750 to 2,000 mm. The topography of the region 
is characterized by low steepness (6-9%) on top and middle 
part of the hillslope, and higher steepness (10-14%) near the 
drainage channels. The soils of this catchment were classified 
as Ultisols, Alfisols and Oxisols. These soils are basaltic and 
well developed, thus exhibiting high amounts of clay and 
iron oxides. Therefore, the sediment produced is reddish and 
presents small average particle diameter. The average SSC of 
the Conceição River during base flow is 16 mg L-1, and 
110 mg L-1 during the high flow. Despite the soil of the region 
is mainly managed in the no-tillage system, rills and gullies 
are found in cultivated areas and roads.

The Guaporé river catchment is located in the northeastern 
region of Rio Grande do Sul, with an area of approximately 
2,000 km2, with heterogeneous landscape and soil management. 
The climate, according to the Köppen classification is Cfb, super 
humid subtropical, mesothermic, with cool summers, no dry 
season and severe frosts. The annual average precipitation is 
1,400 to 2,000 mm. The soils of this catchment were classified 
as Ultisols, Oxisols, Entisols and Luvisol. These soils are 
basaltic and very diverse due to the different landforms of the 
landscape. This diversity is also due to the varied particle sizes 
transported, since there are well developed soils with deep 
profile and young soils with shallow profile. Slopes and shallow 
soils, combined with non-use of soil conservation practices, 
promote erosion, generating significant amount of surface 
runoff and high soil loss rates in most part of this catchment. 
There are gentle slopes and deep soils in the upper third of the 
Guaporé catchment, but hillsides are long, and few grooves 
may form by water erosion in no-tillage areas.

Rain gauges, sensor depth and turbidimeter were used 
to monitor rainfalls, flow discharge and sediment flux, 
respectively. The mathematical relation between turbidity 
output in millivolt (mV) and nephelometric turbidity units 
(NTU) was performed using a solution of polymers (polymer 
bead calibration solutions). The calibration with the solution 
used the points 0 (distilled water), 40, 100, 400, 800, 1000 and 
3000 NTU. The sensor was subjected to different concentrations

of the standard solution (from the lowest to the highest 
concentration) and 20 signals emitted by the sensor (in mV) 
were recorded, which were then converted into means for each 
concentration. A regression curve that converts mV into NTU 
was established. This analysis was used to the operation of the 
equipment and defining its linearity, repeatability and accuracy. 

Turbidity (NTU) were correlated with the corresponding 
SSC (mg L-1), testing four mathematical relations:

(i) SSC-NTU using a time-integrated sampler to collect 
sediment samples;

(ii) SSC-NTU using suspended sediment samples collected 
during the rainfalls;

(iii) SSC-NTU using daily-suspended sediment samples;
(iv) SSC-NTU using weekly-suspended sediment samples.

SSC-NTU using a time-integrated sampler to collect 
sediment samples

Station time-integrated samplers were installed in each 
gauge station for sample collection. These sampler devices 
are easy to manufacture and are installed close to the river 
bed to collect sediments for a certain period of time, which 
can range from weeks to months, depending on the quantity 
of material transported in suspension. The construction was 
based on the sampler described by Phillips et al. (2000), using 
7.5-cm diameter and 80-cm long PVC (polyvinyl polychloride) 
pipes, with caps with holes and 4-mm diameter pipes in both 
ends. The physical principle of operation is the small flow 
rate from the sampler favoring sediment settling, including 
clay particles. The samplers were submerged for a period of 
three months and then removed and taken to the laboratory 
to compose the different SSC. 

The samples were dried in a forced-air circulation oven 
at 60 °C, and then the organic material was oxidized with 
hydrogen peroxide and dispersed with 60 mL of sodium 
hydroxide solution at 1%, followed by mechanical stirring 
for 12 h. Finally, the solutions were placed in black plastic 
bottles to avoid light interference at the time of calibration. 
The concentrations used were 0, 10, 40, 100, 300, 600, 1000, 
1500 and 3000 mg L-1, and 20 NTU turbidity readings (replicate 
measurements) were performed for each concentration, which 
generally had little or small standard deviation. These 20 
readings were converted into a single mean NTU used in the 
NTU-SSC mathematical relation. 

SSC-NTU using suspended sediment samples collected 
during the rainfalls

Suspension sediment samples were collected during the 
rainfalls close to the in-situ turbidimeter (Table 1) using 

a hand-held isokinetic sampler USDH-48. Samples were 
collected during the rising and falling hydrograph limb. 

Suspended sediment samples were analysed in a laboratory 
using the evaporation method (Shreve &amp;amp; Downs, 2005) to 
determine the SSC. The SSC obtained in each sample was 
correlated with the turbidity (NTU).

SSC-NTU using daily-suspended sediment samples
Daily suspended sediment samples were collected by local 

observer using an isokinetic sampler, similar to the USDH 
48. The observer recorded date and time and identified the 
samples for subsequent correspondence with the turbidity data 
(NTU). The samples were properly stored and weekly sent to 
the laboratory to determine the SSC, as describe before. Daily 
SSC were correlated with the daily turbidity. 

SSC-NTU using weekly-suspended sediment 
Suspended sediment samples were collected every week 

using an isokinetic sampler, similar to the USDH 48 and sent 
to the laboratory to evaluate the SSC, as describe before. Thus, 
once a week a field campaign was carried out to sample the SSC.

Data analysis
In addition to the SSC analysis, the grain size of the 

samples was analysed to determine the average particle 
size of the samples collected with the SSC time-integrated 
sampler and during one rainfall event monitored in the two 
catchments. The average particle size (d50 in micrometers) was 
determined by the method of laser beam diffraction, using a 
laser granulometer. The method of particle size analysis also 
involved the burning of organic matter, chemical dispersion 
with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and mechanical dispersion 
for a period of 12 h, before read by the laser granulometer 
(Beckman Coulter LS 13 320). 

The data pairs (turbidity-SSC) were plotted and fitted to the 
most appropriate regression equation for the nature of the data 
in all sampling strategies. Differences between the sampling 
methods and possible interferences was also analysed. 

Results and Discussion

For samples collected daily, 191 SSC samples were collected 
in the Conceição and 171 SSC samples in the Guaporé 
catchment. In the case of weekly samples, 15 pairs of data in 
the Conceição catchment and 17 in the Guaporé catchment 
were used to develop the regression equation. It should be 
noted that between December 2011 and June 2012 there was 
a severe drought in the region without the occurrence of 
significant rainfall events. 

Figure 2 shows the four mathematical regression between 
SSC-NTU. The results obtained in the calibration performed 
with samples of suspended sediment collected by time-
integrated samplers were fitted to a second-degree polynomial 
equation, with R2 = 1.00 (Conceição) and 0.98 (Guaporé) 
(Figure 2A). The advantage of using synthetic samples from the 
time-integrated sampler is to prepare high SSC that in many 
rainfall events are not possible to be reached.

sediment samples collected during rainfall events is illustrated * Occurrence of rainfall events with soil moisture near saturation due to prior rainfall

Figure 2. Suspended sediment concentration - SSC Calibration curves for two experimental catchments under different 
sampling strategies: (A) with time integrated sampler, (B) collections in rainfall events, and weekly (C) and daily (D) collections

in Figure 2B. Despite large magnitude rainfall events were 
monitored, the maximum SSC did not exceed 600 mg L-1 in 
either location. The data of both turbidimeters were fitted to 
a linear equation. According to the Figure 2C and D, the SSC 
of the Conceição and Guaporé catchments was similar and the 
turbidity was greater in the Conceição. Despite the difference 
found in the particle size carried in suspension, it is unlikely 
that it affected the scattering of light emitted by the sensor (Rai 
&amp;amp; Kumar, 2015). Other interfering factors not accounted for in 
this study may have caused the difference found, for example, 
color and mineralogy of the soil from each catchment. In the 
Conceição catchment, relief is gentle and wavy, and climate is 
warmer and humid, which favors the development of soils with 
deep profile, red soils with lots of clay minerals 1:1 (kaolinite) 
and iron oxides. These aspects should be explored in future 
researches. 

The particle size (d50) in the time-integrated sampler 
strategy was 11.94 (Conceição) and 13.21 ?m (Guaporé); and 
in the strategy of sampling by rainfall events the d50 was 5.13 
(07/20/2011) and 6.59 (07/21/2011) for Conceição and Guaporé 

catchments, respectively. The granulometric analysis showed 
two important aspects: the differences between the catchments 
are not sufficient to explain the differences in the turbidity 
signal recorded on the calibration charts, and the rainfall event 
sampling exhibit d50 significantly lower, indicating that the 
sampler is not completely effective in retaining fine sediments. 
It is expected that in this case, a mathematical relation curve 
for rainfall event samples would have smaller inclination angle, 
since particles of larger size compared to smaller particles (time 
integrated sampler x rainfall event sampling, and samples from 
the Guaporé x Conceição) in a same concentration generate a 
smaller backscatter (Figure 3) (Merten et al., 2014). 

The amplitude of SSC was small in the weekly sampling 
(Figure 2C). The maximum SSC did not exceed 25 mg L-1, 
except for a sample from the Conceição catchment, with 89 mg L-1. 
However, there is a high degree of uncertainty for establishing 
a regression curve when having only one sample at the end of 
the curve, thus, this data was not presented in the graph (Figure 
2C). The results of this timescale is little used, since most 
sediment yield occurs during flooding when the concentration 

y = 0.003x2 + 1.317x - 19.759    R2 = 1.0
y = 0.007x2 + 2.307x - 45.795    R2 = 0.976

y = 1.058x - 28.246    R2 = 0.693
y = 2.108x - 94.462    R2 = 0.808

y = 0.590x - 3.045    R2 = 0.870
y = 0.549x - 13.835    R2 = 0.705

y = 1.163x - 30.458    R2 = 0.826
y = 0.502x - 1.050    R2 = 0.707

financial costs of the SSC sampling strategies for the period of one year (B)

of sediment is much greater than the magnitude obtained by 
this scale. These samplings occurred during a period of low 
rainfall, which may explain the low concentration of suspended 
sediments, with predominance of dissolved solid (&amp;lt;0.45 ?m) 
fractions during this collection period. The range of SSC in 
daily sampling (Figure 2D) was higher than that in the weekly 
sampling, but it did not exceed 200 mg L-1, except for one 
sample from Conceição catchment, which presented SCC of 
720 mg L-1, and was also not shown in the graph (Figure 2D). 

The data in Figure 2 were organized differently to indicate 
differences and limitations found in the methods (Figures 4A 
and B). It appears that the calibration with sediments, obtained 
using the integrated sampler, overestimates SSC compared with 
the other calibrations, perhaps by the effect of the reduction in 
the backscatter from coarser sediments in higher proportion. 
Differences in magnitude of SSC not contemplated by weekly 
and daily sampling became evident in Figures 4A and B. 

Finally, Figure 5A describes the SSC sampler calendar 
for rainfall event, daily and weekly. Four rainfall events were 
monitored at the Conceição gauge station, where 82 SSC 

samples were collected. In the Guaporé catchment, three 
rainfall events were monitored and 35 samples were collected. 
Despite the small number of rainfall events, the collected 
samples covered a wide range of SSC. 

The financial cost of all SSC sampling strategies was also 
analyzed, such as researchers' daily expenses, transportation 
(700 km round trip), construction of SSC samplers, and SSC 
sample analysis (Figure 5B). The daily collections appear to 
have higher cost, followed by weekly collections and rainfall 
events. Collections with time-integrated samplers had much 
lower costs than the other strategies. 

Taking into account the costs and benefits of each sampling 
strategy, the use of daily and weekly sampling is not advantageous. 
These samplings present high cost and low efficiency, since the 
amplitude of SSC is not satisfactory to construct a calibration 
curve, requiring extrapolation to samples with higher turbidity, 
increasing the chances of error. The costs of sampling rainfall 
events are high, but the information obtained has great reliability, 
with a good amplitude of SSC data and sediment characteristics

(size, color, mineralogy) resulting in a reliable database (Bouchez 
et al., 2011; Landers &amp;amp; Sturm, 2013). Furthermore, according 
to Lewis (1996), few pairs of data (less than 10) representing 
the SSC interval should be sufficient to establish a reliable 
relationship between turbidity and SSC during these rainfall 
events. The use of a time-integrated sampler presented lower 
cost but differences in comparison to rainfall event sampling, 
however, it is a reasonable alternative for obtaining samples for 
rainfall event calibration in situations of financial constraint and 
also as a supplementary method. It should be noted that rainfall 
event monitoring is essential and irreplaceable, both for the 
turbidimeter calibration and sediment concentration analysis. 

Conclusions

1. The use of turbidity to estimate suspended sediment 
concentrations is affected by the calibration methodology.

2. Sampling on weekly and daily scales does not provide a 
range of concentrations representative of sediment transport 
in the monitored rivers. Moreover, these sampling methods 
have high costs of monitoring and analysis.

3. The calibration strategy using time-integrated samplers 
and rainfall events are complementary to each other and enable a 
correct calibration of turbidimeters and calibration tests regarding 
the effect of interfering factors (size, color and mineralogy).
