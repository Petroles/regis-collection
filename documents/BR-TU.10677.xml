AGRADECIMENTOS

Em primeiro lugar gostaria de agradecer sinceramente ao meus orientadores, o Doutor Paulo 
Fernandes, o Doutor David Chew e o Doutor Raul Jorge.

Ao Doutor Paulo Fernandes pela sua amizade, dedicação, confiança e disponibilidade para 
transferência constante de conhecimentos sobre maturação orgânica a geologia regional. Todo 
este trabalho de doutoramento não teria existido sem o seu planeamento e concepção do plano 
de trabalhos inicial. Todos os momentos passados em conjunto foram extremamente 
enriquecedores. Desde já o meu grande obrigado e espero que ter estado à altura 
das expectativas criadas, desejando muito mais trabalho conjunto no futuro.

Ao Doutor David Chew o muito obrigado pela aceitação em ser meu orientador, pela sua 
permanente disponibilidade, paciência, atenção e troca de conhecimentos. O seu pragmatismo 
carregado de confiança permitiram ultrapassar as situações mais adversas quando tudo parecia 
perdido. Sem o seu auxilio e clareza, o planeamento inicial não teria sido tão eficaz.

Ao Doutor Raul Jorge pela amizade e disponibilidade tanto para o trabalho de campo e 
laboratorial como para longos debates e esclarecimento sobre as dúvidas que iam surgindo. 
Um muito obrigado por tudo.

Durante todo o período dos trabalhos de doutoramento, muitas foram as pessoas que me 
ajudaram de várias maneiras e às quais gostaria de deixar uma palavra sincera de 
agradecimento, nomeadamente:

Um especial agradecimento à Doutora Zélia Pereira e ao Doutor Narciso Ferreira do LNEG 
de São Mamede de Infesta pela utilização dos seus laboratório e pela hospitalidade e carinho 
durante as estadias no Porto. Mais a sul, no LNEG de Beja, ao Doutor João Matos pela 
preciosa informação sobre os afloramentos e disponibilidade para localizar e facilitar as 
amostras num labirinto de sondagens.

Durante as longas estadias em Dublin, o acolhimento, preocupação e interesse demonstradas 
pelo Doutor Geoof Clayton foram de grande conforto. Nos laboratórios, o “terror” e ajuda 
prestada pelo Frank foram de estrema importância. Para ambos, muito obrigado.

Ao Doutor Fin Stuart e à Doutora Luigia pela disponibilidade em me receberem no SUERC, 
em Glasgow, e apresentarem-me aos “deuses” do Hélio, abrindo-me assim uma porta para um 
mundo misterioso. Pela paciência, compreensão a extrema atenção prestada, apesar do caos 
laboratorial provocado, um muito obrigado 

Durante este percurso existiram muitos momentos bons, e outros menos bons, nos quais tive 
sempre a companhia de muitos colegas e amigos que me apoiaram. Felizmente foram muitos, 
e, cada um à sua maneira, tiveram um papel importante neste trabalho. Sem a vossa ajuda 
teria sido muito mais difícil. Muito obrigado a todos!

Obrigado a toda a minha família pelo o apoio incondicional desde sempre. Em particular à 
minha mãe pelas longas e árduas horas a processar uma quantidade enorme de amostras para 
que eu conseguisse ter tudo feito dentro do período estabelecido.

Por último, este trabalho não teria sido possível sem o apoio financeiro da Fundação para a 
Ciência e Tecnologia, através da bolsa de doutoramento com a 
referência SFRH/BD/62213/2009 e do Centro de Investigação Marinha e Ambiental (CIMA) 
da Universidade do Algarve.

RESUMO 

 

Com objetivo de reconstruir a história térmica da Zona Sul Portuguesa e da Bacia do Algarve 

foi realizado um estudo sistemático com auxílio de três metodologias complementares: 

medição da reflectância da vitrinite, datações de traços de fissão e de datações (U-Th)/He de 

apatites. A vitrinite é um grupo de maceral que deriva das paredes celulares ou dos tecidos 

lenhosos de plantas, e que é bastante abundante em rochas sedimentares, em particular em 

margas e xistos argilosos. A reflectância da vitrinite é sensível à temperatura num processo 

irreversível, ou seja, indica a temperatura máxima a que uma rocha sedimentar esteve sujeita 

durante a diagénese, sendo um excelente indicador da maturação das rochas fonte de 

hidrocarbonetos. Para esse efeito, foram recolhidas sessenta e cinco amostras de rochas de 

afloramentos do Grupo do Flysch do Baixo Alentejo, da Bacia do Algarve e da Bacia de Viar. 

Foram ainda recolhidas dez amostras em dois furos de prospecção mineira que interceptaram 

a Formação de Mértola do Grupo do Flysch do Baixo Alentejo. As litologias selecionadas 

foram xistos argilosos, margas e argilitos. Os traços de fissão são defeitos criados na estrutura 

cristalina dos cristais devido ao decaimento por fissão espontânea do 238U. Os traços de fissão 

ficam preservados no cristal quando a temperatura ambiente das rochas permanece abaixo da 

temperatura de annealing (“reset”), que no caso da apatite se situa entre os 60 e os 120ºC, 

dependendo entre outros, do conteúdo em Cl. Medindo os traços de fissão e determinando o 

conteúdo dos diferentes isótopos de U, é possível determinar o período em que o cristal, e 

consequentemente toda a rocha, terá permanecido sob temperaturas inferiores à de annealing. 

Já as datações pelo método (U-Th)/He consistem nas medições dos isótopos  4He, U e Th 

presente em cada cristal. À semelhança dos traços de fissão, estas idades vão sendo 

progressivamente “apagadas” com o aquecimento, ocorrendo o reset total aproximadamente 

aos 75ºC nos minerais de apatite.  

No sentido de inferir sobre a proveniência das formações do Grupo do Flysch do Baixo 

Alentejo e do Triásico da Bacia Algarvia, foram obtidos dados U-Pb e de elementos traços 

(REE) de zircões e apatites através de ablasão a laser no departamento de Geologia do Trinity 

College Dublin, Irlanda. 

Para os estudos de termocronologia de baixa temperatura, geocronologia e proveniência 

sedimentar, foram recolhidos um total de cinquenta e cinco amostras de rochas de 

afloramentos da Ossa Morena, Zona Sul Portuguesa e da Bacia Algarvia. Outras doze

amostras foram recolhidas de dois furos de prospecção mineira localizados na Zona Sul 

Portuguesa.  

No que se refere à história térmica, as paleotemperaturas calculadas a partir da reflectância da 

vitrinite para as amostras do Grupo do Flysch do Baixo Alentejo, situam-se entre os 236 e os 

326ºC. A paleotemperatura mais elevada (414ºC) desta unidade foi registada no contacto com 

Complexo Alcalino intrusivo de Monchique. As idades de traços de fissão indicaram que o 

teor em Cl das apatites mostrou ter uma forte influência sobre as idades obtidas.  Todas as 

amostras do Grupo do Flysch do Baixo Alentejo sofreram o “reset” após a deposição, 

apresentando idades Cretácicas (111-59,9 Ma) e uma única idade do Jurássico superior 

(amostra OL1-157,9 Ma). As idades dos traços de fissão das amostras recolhidas em litologias 

da Zona Ossa Morena e da Zona Sul Portuguesa indicam que exumação deve ter ocorrido 

como um bloco contíguo nestas duas zonas tectonoestratigráficas. Através da modelação 

térmica foi possível constatar que as amostras da Zona Ossa Morena (Pias1 e PL1) 

apresentam um arrefecimento lento a moderado até aos 240 Ma, seguindo-se um 

arrefecimento rápido durante o Triásico até aproximadamente à temperatura de retenção 

parcial da apatite aos 200 Ma. Uma última fase de arrefecimento gradual iniciou-se no granito 

Pias aos 65 Ma até que fosse atingida uma temperatura superficial. A taxa de exumação 

estimada para o granito de Pias é de 30 m/Ma desde os 65 Ma até ao presente. Na amostra do 

granito de El Pedroso, a última fase de arrefecimento iniciou-se às 35 Ma. Desde então até o 

presente foi inferida uma taxa de exumação de 65m/Ma.  

A modelação inversa efetuada na amostra (????) da Formação de Mértola do Grupo do Flysch 

do Baixo Alentejo da Zona Sul Portuguesa, apresenta um episódio de aquecimento após a 

subsidência que se encontra relacionado com a ultima fase da tectónica Varisca. Depois de ter 

sido atingida a temperatura máxima de 300°C aos 320 Ma, a amostra arrefeceu até uma 

temperatura de 150 °C aos 260 Ma. Dos 260 Ma até aos 20 Ma, a amostra permaneceu na 

zona de retenção parcial da apatite. Esse longo período a uma temperatura constante pode 

estar relacionado a uma possível re-subsidência associada à deposição de sedimentos 

mesozóicos da Bacia do Algarve, pois a amostra localiza-se próximo do contacto entre estas 

duas unidades geológicas. Dos 20 Ma até à atualidade pode ser inferida uma taxa de 

exumação de 75m/Ma  

Na Bacia do Algarve os valores poder refletor da vitrinite medidos para as unidades do 

Triásico situam-se entre os 1-1,1%Rr, correspondendo a paleotemperaturas entre os 148 e 

158ºC.  No caso das litologias do Cretácico inferior (0,6%Rr), na parte ocidental da Bacia do

Algarve, as paleotemperaturas máximas não foram suficientes para fazer o reset do sistema de 

traços de fissão da apatite. No entanto, as amostras recolhidas na Praia da Luz, perto do 

contato com a intrusão básica da Ponta das Ferrarias, indicam que o efeito térmico desta 

intrusão é intenso mas restrito a uma distância máxima de cerca de 2 km do contato com o 

corpo magmático intrusivo. A modelação térmica realizada para as margas do Cretácico 

Inferior em contacto e para diferente distâncias da intrusão, sugere uma temperatura máxima 

de 275ºC alcançada pelas amostras mais perto do contacto intrusivo e que estas arrefeceram 

para uma temperatura ca. 100ºC em apenas 10 000 anos. 

As idades de traços de fissão da apatite obtidas nas amostras de arenitos do Triásico Superior 

da Bacia Algarvia, são mais antigas do que a idade de deposição, o que significa que as 

amostras não sofreram o reset total. Assim, a anomalia térmica criado pela intrusão Complexo 

Alcalino de Monchique foi muito circunscrita a uma zona perto do contato não afetando 

significativamente os processos térmicos de maturação regional da Bacia do Algarve. No 

entanto, os efeitos térmicos de pequenas intrusões relacionadas com o Complexo Alcalino de 

Monchique na Bacia do Algarve não poderão ser totalmente negligenciados.  

Através da modelação térmica do Complexo Alcalino de Monchique foi possível verificar que 

este arrefeceu rapidamente desde temperaturas magmáticas (&gt; 600ºC) para cerca de 70°C, 

temperatura das rochas encaixantes no momento da intrusão, num curto espaço de tempo (3 

Ma). Se considerarmos um gradiente geotérmico normal, o Complexo Alcalino de Monchique 

deverá ter-se instalado a cerca de 2 km de profundidade. Desde os 69 aos 5 Ma o CAM 

permaneceu a uma temperatura constante próximo da temperatura de retenção parcial da 

apatite. Dos 5 Ma até à atualidade as amostras arrefeceram desde os 50ºC até à temperatura 

superficial, podendo ser inferida uma taxa de exumação de 0,3km/Ma dos 5 Ma até ao 

presente. 

A geocronologia de zircões e apatites detríticas, bem como o conteúdo em elementos Terras 

Raras das apatites, permitiram inferir sobre a sua origem sedimentar. Verificou-se que os 

espectros de idades U-Pb de zircões detríticos e também as idades 207Pb corrigidas do Grupo 

do Flysch do Baixo Alentejo apresentaram diferenças significativas entre as formações de 

Mértola/Mira e da Formação Brejeira. Mais concretamente, os espectros de idades U-Pb dos 

zircões detritícos das formações de Mértola e Mira indicam ambas uma proveniência 

extrabasinal (Zona Ossa-Morena) e intrabasinal (Zona Sul Portuguesa). A abundância de 

zircões detríticos nos intervalos 500-750 Ma e 900-1100 Ma na Formação Brejeira, sugerem 

uma área fonte com origem nos terrenos da Avalónia-Meguma,  com uma menor reciclagem

do Domino Sul Português (Formação Tercenas). Já os arenitos do Triásico da Bacia Algarvia 

têm origem em múltiplas fontes, onde zircões detríticos com idades U-Pb pérmicas estão mais 

presentes na parte oriental da bacia, o que pode refletir uma contribuição local de bacias 

Pérmico-Triásicas existentes em Espanha, e.g. a Bacia de Viar. 

Como complemento foram ainda datados dois granitos da Zona da Ossa Morena (granito de 

Pias e El Pedroso) que forneceram idades corrigidas de 207Pb em apatite de 334,9±4,3 Ma 

para o granito de Pias-Pedrogão  e de 340,5±7.6Ma para o granito de El Pedroso, caindo os 

dois granitos no intervalo de idades dos corpos plutónicos do Carbonífero da Ossa-Morena 

Zona definidos por Salman (2004).  

As informações sobre a história térmica resultante deste estudo podem ter um impacto sobre o 

potencial económico para exploração de gás convencional e não convencional na Zona Sul 

Portuguesa. Os valores do poder refletor da vitrinite medidos nas amostras da Zona Sul 

Portuguesa correspondem a uma temperatura máxima entre os 236 e 326ºC. Estas 

temperaturas foram atingidas após a subsidência e durante a deformação tectónica. A 

deformação foi seguida de uma fase de arrefecimento relacionada com uma fase de exumação 

até aos 200 Ma. Os hidrocarbonetos gerados após a deposição devem ter sido libertados 

durante esse período. Dos 200 Ma até aos 20 Ma a temperatura permaneceu constante entre os 

100 e os 60°C, no entanto as rochas já se encontravam sobrematuras em relação as fases de 

geração de hidrocarbonetos. A exumação pronunciada que se fez sentir no sul do território 

Português desde o Cretácico Superior pode ter destruído qualquer sistema petrolífero 

existente. No entanto, a história deposicional e térmica na parte da Bacia Algarvia localizada 

no offshore poderá ter sido diferente, pelo que estudos mais estudos e mais detalhados serão 

necessários para se compreender o potencial total da Bacia Algarvia.

ABSTRACT 

 

Organic maturation levels (vitrinite reflection) were combined with low-temperature 

thermochronometers (apatite fission track analysis and (U-Th)/He in apatite) to construct 

temperature-time paths for the Upper Palaeozoic rocks of the South Portuguese Zone and the 

Mesozoic rocks of the Algarve Basin. Detrital zircon ages were also studied in order to 

constrain the sedimentary source regions and basin fill history of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch 

Group from South Portuguese Zone and the Upper Triassic sandstones from the Algarve 

Basin. The maximum temperature attained in the South Portuguese Zone was 326 ºC and 

occurred at 320 Ma. All the samples from the South Portuguese Zone have been totally reset 

after deposition and yield apatite fission track ages ranging from the Cretaceous (111 to 59.9 

Ma) to the Upper Jurassic (157.9 Ma). The fission track ages from the Upper Triassic 

sandstone did not reset after de deposition, however, the intrusion of the Monchique Alkaline 

Complex (MAC) and related swarm of dikes had local influence upon organic maturation. 

Inverse modelling on apatite samples from the MAC indicate that it cooled very fast from 

initial magmatic temperatures to around 70ºC. The rock sample studied stayed at a constant 

temperature close to the top of the apatite partial annealing zone from 68.7 Ma to 5 Ma. Since 

5 Ma until the present the MAC underwent an exhumation of ca. 300 m/Ma.  

The U-Pb detrital zircon and apatite ages from the Mértola and Mira formations suggest 

sedimentary provenance areas from a detrital intrabasinal source (South Portuguese Zone) and 

from areas associated with the magmatic arc related rocks located at the southern border of 

the Ossa Morena Zone. The U-Pb detrital zircon ages obtained for the Brejeira Formation 

suggest a source area related to the Avalonian/Meguma terranes and also from recycled 

clastic sediments associated to the South Portuguese Domain. The ages from the Algarve 

Basin Upper Triassic sandstones suggest that they are derived from multiple sources terranes 

with Permian zircons ages more abundant in the samples located in the eastern part of the 

basin.

I - INTRODUCTION 
 

Low-temperature thermochronology is widely used to determine the cooling histories of 

crustal rocks and to constrain the timing and rates of exhumation processes. Information on 

the maximum temperature reached by a sedimentary rock can be obtained from vitrinite 

reflectance that is the most reliable indicator of thermal maturation in sedimentary rocks, as 

the chemical reactions which control the increase of reflectance in vitrinite are irreversible. 

Therefore, vitrinite reflectance can be considered as a non-retrogressive 

palaeogeothermometer for diagenetic and low-grade metamorphic conditions. Despite the 

large amount of research that has been undertaken on the South Portuguese Zone and the 

Algarve Basin, the thermal history is not well constrained. The timing and duration of burial 

and cooling events is still unknown or misunderstood. Combining low-temperature 

thermochronometers and vitinite reflectance will allow the identification and characterisation 

of the major episodes of heating and cooling which have affected the Variscan basement of 

the South Portuguese Zone, in particular the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group, and the Meso-

Cenozoic sedimentary sequences of the Algarve Basin. 

 

The sedimentary provenance of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group from South Portuguese 

Zone and from the basal unit of the Algarve Basin, namely the Upper Triassic Silves 

Sandstones, remains shrouded in controversy. The detrital record of sedimentary basins that 

occur adjacent to tectonic terranes with distinct tectono-thermal histories can be used to 

discriminate their original source area(s). For instance, the U–Pb ages of individual detrital 

zircon and apatite grains are commonly used in sedimentary provenance analysis providing a 

reliable guide to the ages of basement source and can be integrated with other techniques such 

as petrographic studies and geochemical data. In this way, several samples were dated by the 

U-Pb detrital zircon and apatite method in the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group and in the 

Algarve Basin to better constrain its sedimentary sources.    

 

This research had a duration of 48 months and was supported by the Foundation of Science 

and Technology (FCT) through a PhD Grant (reference number SFRH/BD/62213/2009).

1.1 OBJECTIVES  
 

The propose objectives of this research project are: 

- Assess the maximum palaeotemperatures attained by the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group of 

South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin using vitrinite reflectance (VR); 

- Establish the timing and duration of cooling after peak metamorphism by using multiple 

low-temperature thermochronological techniques;  

- Infer the magnitude and timing of crustal exhumation based on vitrinite reflectance and low 

temperature thermochronometry; 

- Integrate these data (vitrinite reflectance and low temperature thermochronometry) to 

reconstruct the burial and exhumations histories of Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group of South 

Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin; 

- Use these results to assess the potential of offshore petroleum systems in terms of the timing 

of source organic maturation and tectonic history of potential reservoirs; 

- Investigate the influence of apatite mineral composition on fission track and (U-Th)/He data 

and to integrate these techniques with VR data; 

-Investigate the REE apatite composition as a provenance host rock indicator;  

-Investigate the provenance of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group and the Upper Triassic Silves 

Sandstones from the Algarve Basin based on their U-Pb detrital zircon and apatite age 

spectra. 

1.2 METHODOLOGY  
 

A detailed description of the analytical methods employed in this study will be described in 

each respective chapter. As it was impossible to prepare and analyse all the samples in the 

same research institution, it was necessary accomplish the tasks in different locations. The 

sample preparation for organic maturation analyses was fully processed in the laboratory 

facilities of University of the Algarve (UAlg). The heavy mineral separation was undertaken 

at the University of the Algarve (UAlg), at the Departamento de Geologia da Faculdade de 

Ciências of Lisbon University (DG/FCUL) and at the Department of Geology, Trinity College 

Dublin. All the fission track and U-Pb measurements were undertaken at the Department of 

Geology, Trinity College Dublin. The (U-Th)/He analyses were performed in the laboratories 

of the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC), in Glasgow.

II – GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING  
 

The geological setting of the studied area, sampling strategy and sample descriptions are 

presented in this chapter.  

2.1 GEOLOGICAL SETTING  
 

The study area covers a large geographical region from the western and southern Atlantic 

coast (Fig. 2.1), as far east as Seville parallel and as far north as Beja. The following section 

briefly describes the geological evolution of the sampling localities. 

 

                  
Figure  2.1 Geographic location of the studied area. The inlet boxes show the location of the geologic maps in 
figures 2.2 (A), 2.3 (B) and 2.4 (C).  

2.1.1 Ossa Morena Zone  
 
The Ossa Morena Zone (OMZ) is one of the major tectonostratigraphic units of the Iberian 

Variscan Belt. It is composed of folded, thrusted and metamorphosed rocks of Precambrian 

and Palaeozoic age and abundant intrusive bodies emplaced before and during the Variscan 

orogenic cycle (Antunes, 2006). 

 

In the Portuguese part of the Ossa Morena Zone several sectors with distinct stratigraphy and 

structure have been identified and these have been subdivided into different 

tectonostratigraphic units, also termed “sectors” or “domains” (Carvalho et al., 1971; Delgado  



 
CHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING “An Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and 
provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)”

et al., 1977; Apalategui et al., 1990; Oliveira et al., 1991). They are from north to south: 

Blastomylonitic Belt Sector; Alter do Chão-Elvas Sector; Estremoz-Barrancos Sector; 

Montemor-Ficalho Sector; Évora Massif; Beja Igneous Complex and the Beja Acebuches 

Ophiolite complex. The Blastomylonitic Belt Sector in the north and the Beja Acebuches 

Ophiolite complex at the south of the Ossa Morena Zone are considered to be two orogenic 

sutures and thus the limits of the Ossa Morena Zone are defined based on the presence of 

basic igneous rocks with oceanic affinities (Azor, 2004; Pérez-Estaún et al., 2004). The Ossa 

Morena Zone is not the main subject of this study and a reader is advised to consult the 

referenced authors for more detailed information.  

Regarding the evolution of the OMZ, it commenced with the erosion of the Cadomian chain 

in late Proterozoic times, when a large Lower Cambrian carbonate platform built up over a 

large area (Oliveira et al., 1991). Extensional tectonism during the Marianian (Lower 

Cambrian) generated tholeitic basic volcanics and several sedimentary depocenters, which 

were rapidly filled up with sediments during a Middle Cambrian marine regression. During 

the Middle Cambrian, a renewed pulse of extensional tectonism led to the development of 

sedimentary basins that filled up with terrigenous sediments, alkaline basalts and minor 

peralkaline volcanics. Tectonic blocks generated during this extensional phase were rotated 

and uplifted leading to the karstification of the Lower Cambrian carbonates (Oliveira et al., 

1991). The Ordovician sedimentary rocks are usually terrigenous and fine grained with 

interbedded alkaline basalts and rest unconformably on the Middle Cambrian sediments, 

indicating an upper Cambrian depositional hiatus (Oliveira et al., 1991). At the top of the 

Ordovician sediments occurs an extensive shallow water sandstone unit, which is associated 

with a polygenic conglomerate. In early Devonian times sedimentation was dominated by 

shallow-water terrigenous and carbonate sediments. During the Middle Devonian, uplift of 

the OMZ took place as a consequence of subduction to the south.  The Late Devonian and 

Early Carboniferous were marked by oblique collision between the OMZ and the South 

Portuguese Zone, characterized by obduction in the SE and subduction in the NW (Oliveira et 

al., 1991). 

Magmatic activity related to the Variscan orogenic cycle is represented by volcanic and 

plutonic rocks with ages clustered in the age interval 345-280 Ma (e.g. Pinto, 1987; Sánchez-

Carretero et al., 1990; Dunning et al., 2002; Salman, 2004). According to their relationships 

with respect to the main Variscan tectonic events, the Variscan granitoids are generally 

subdivided into two groups: syn-tectonic and late/post-tectonic (Antunes, 2006).

2.1.2 South Portuguese Zone 
 
The northern boundary of the South Portuguese Zone with the Ossa Morena Zone is defined 

by the Beja Acebuches Ophiolite which is interpreted as a remnant of the Rheic Ocean that 

separated the Euramerican South Portuguese Zone from the Ossa Morena Zone (Oliveira 

1990; Quesada et al., 1994; Oliveira &amp;amp; Quesada, 1998; Braid et al., 2011; Oliveira et al., 

2013a). 

The South Portuguese Zone is divided into four domains (Oliveira, 1990; Ribeiro et al., 

1990), which are from NE to SW, the Pulo do Lobo Antiform, the Pyrite Belt, the Baixo 

Altentejo Flysch Group and the Southwest Portugal Domain (Fig. 2.2).  

The Pulo do Lobo Antiform has been interpreted as representing an exhumed suture zone or 

accretionary prism that records the final stages of the closure of the Rheic Ocean and the 

terminal collision between Gondwana and Laurussia (e.g. Eden, 1991; Onézime et al. 2003; 

Oliveira et al., 2013b). The Pulo do Lobo Formation crops out in the core of the Pulo do Lobo 

Antiform and consists of highly deformed phyllites and quartzites with intercalations of 

amphibolites of mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) affinity in the lower parts of the sequence 

(Munhá, 1983). U-Pb detrital zircon data from the quartzites suggest a maximum depositional 

age of 438 Ma (Silurian) for this formation (Braid et al., 2011). Flysch-type successions crop 

out on the northern and southern flanks of the Pulo do Lobo Antiform. These rocks are dated 

by palynomorphs as Frasnian to late Famennian in age (Pereira et al., 2006, 2008).  

The Iberian Pyrite Belt succession consists of phyllites and quartzites of the Phyllite Quartzite 

Group overlain by volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the Volcano-Sedimentary Complex 

(Oliveira, 1990). Palynomorphs in the uppermost part of the Phyllite Quartzite Group indicate 

a Late Devonian (Strunian) age (Pereira et al., 2008). The Iberian Pyrite Belt volcanism 

resulted from a local phase of extensional tectonism and is bi-modal in composition with the 

felsic component dominant (Munhá, 1983, 1990; Mitjavila et al., 1997). The Iberian Pyrite 

Belt rocks are dated as Late Devonian to late Viséan (382.7-330 Ma) based on palynomorphs 

and rare conodont assemblages (Boogaard, 1963, 1967; Oliveira et al., 2004; Pereira et al., 

2007, 2008). Zircons extracted from felsic volcanic rocks yield U-Pb ages ranging from 349 

to 385 Ma (Nesbit et al., 1999; Barrie et al., 2002; Dunning et al., 2002; Rosa et al., 2009; 

Oliveira et al., 2013a).

provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)”

The Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group represents the development of a foreland basin that formed 

as a result of an oblique collision between the South Portuguese Zone and the Ossa Morena 

Zone, with associated tectonic stacking that propagated from the NE to SW (Oliveira et al., 

1979; Oliveira, 1990; Silva et al., 1990; Pereira, 1997, 1999). The Baixo Alentejo Flysch 

Group comprises three formations that are, from oldest to youngest, the Mértola, Mira and 

Brejeira formations (Fig. 2.2). These units are dated as late Viséan (345-326 Ma), 

Serpukhovian to early Bashkirian (326-315 Ma), and late Bashkirian to late Moscovian (315-

307 Ma) respectively (Oliveira et al., 1979; Korn, 1997; Pereira, 1999; Pereira et al., 2006, 

2008). The Mértola Formation comprises beds of greywacke of variable thickness 

interbedded with shales, siltstones, conglomerates and rare mudflows, with the greywacke 

beds exhibiting sedimentary structures typical of turbidites (Oliveira &amp;amp; Wagner Genthis, 

1983). The average modal composition of greywackes from the Mértola Formation is 

Qt46.2F26.9L26.19, where Qt is the modal abundance of quartz, F is the modal abundance of 

feldspar and L is the sum of all lithic fragments (Jorge et al., 2013). The Mira Formation is 

comprised of greywackes interbedded with shales and rare conglomerates (Oliveira et al., 

1979). The average modal composition of the greywackes from the Mira Formation is 

Qt61.7F7.6L30.7 (Jorge et al., 2013). The overlying Brejeira Formation is divided into two 

distinct belts that were recognized during regional geological mapping (Oliveira et al., 1979; 

Oliveira &amp;amp; Wagner Genthis, 1983).  The basal beds consist of quartzites and quartz-wackes 

interbedded with shales while the younger belt consists of immature greywackes interbedded 

with shales. The average modal composition of greywackes from the Brejeira Formation is 

Qt83.1F6.7L10.1. Abundant quartz grains are rounded to sub-rounded and well sorted (Jorge et 

al., 2013). The clastic lithologies in this formation contain abundant clasts of sedimentary 

rocks and metamorphic quartz but are poor in volcanic fragments (Oliveira &amp;amp; Wagner 

Genthis, 1983; Jorge et al., 2013). The Mira and Brejeira formations are interpreted as the 

result of progressive progradation of turbiditic sedimentation towards the SW (Oliveira &amp;amp; 

Wagner Genthis, 1983; Oliveira, 1990). 

The Southwest Portugal Domain succession comprises Late Devonian quartzites and shales of 

the Tercenas Formation followed by a mud-dominated carbonate platform sequence of the 

Carrapateira Group which ranges in age from the Tournaisian to the late Bashkirian (358.9-

315.2 Ma) (Pereira, 1999). A recent U-Pb detrital zircon study from the Tercenas Formation 

quartzites confirms a maximum depositional age of Late Devonian (367±6.4 Ma) for this 

formation (Pereira et al., 2012).

Late Palaeozoic palaeotectonic reconstructions suggest that the South Portuguese Zone was 

part of the Avalonia Plate (e.g., Martinez-Catalán et al., 1997; Oliveira &amp;amp; Quesada, 1998; la 

Rosa et al., 2002; Von Raumer et al., 2003; Ribeiro et al., 2007; Jorge, 2009; Jorge et al., 

2013).  The collision of this plate with the margin of the Ossa Morena Zone (an outboard part 

of Gondwanan Iberia) in early Visean times led to the cessation of volcanism in the Iberian 

Pyrite Belt and a phase of tectonic inversion, resulting in a pulse of rapid uplift on the 

southwest border of the Ossa Morena Zone and the development of a SW-prograding trough 

on the Avalonian margin (Oliveira &amp;amp; Quesada, 1998; Jorge et al., 2013).  

The angular unconformity between the South Portuguese Zone and the Algarve basin marks 

the southern boundary of South Portuguese Zone.

2.1.3 Permian Viar Basin 
 
The Viar Basin is an elongate basin that strikes NW-SE and crops in the Sierra Norte of the 

Seville province (fig. 2.1B and fig. 2.3). Is an intra-orogenic half-graben located between the 

South Portuguese Zone and the Ossa Morena Zone (Sierra et al, 2009). The Permian Viar 

Basin is a result of various extensional–compressive tectonic episodes that occurred along the 

the South Portuguese Zone-Ossa Morena Zone boundary during the final stages of the 

Variscan Orogeny (Simancas, 1983; García-Navarro &amp;amp; Sierra, 1998). This is the 

southernmost occurrence of Permian strata in Iberian (Wagner &amp;amp; Mayoral, 2007). The Viar 

Basin consists of conglomerates, sandstones and lutites with minor intercalated limestone, 

mafic and felsic volcanic rocks (Sierra et al., 2000). Sedimentation started with fluvial 

conglomerates and sandstones with a sedimentary provenance mainly from the Ossa Morena 

Zone (Wagner &amp;amp; Mayoral, 2007; Sierra et al, 1999) The sedimentations had stopped due to 

volcanic activity that fill up the paleotopography  (Wagner &amp;amp; Mayoral, 2007; Sierra et al, 

1999). However, the location of the volcanic vent is difficult to ascertain, probably as a result 

of later compressive deformation (Sierra et al, 1999).

2.1.4 Algarve Basin 
 
The Algarve Basin is the southernmost geological province of mainland Portugal and 

unconformably overlies the South Portuguese Zone. The basin strikes E-W and crops out 

onshore from Cap São Vicente to the Portuguese-Spanish border (Fig. 2.1 and 2.2). More than 

3 km of mostly marine sediments accumulated during Mesozoic-Cenozoic times 

(Mannuepella, 1992). The Mesozoic strata accumulated on a passive margin that formed 

during successive extensional phases from the Late Triassic to the Middle Cretaceous related 

to the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean (Mannupella et al., 1988).  

Sedimentation in the Algarve Basin was initiated in Late Triassic times with the deposition of 

continental red beds and evaporites, which unconformably overlie folded and faulted 

Carboniferous strata (Palain, 1976). The red bed succession consists of sandstones  and 

conglomerates at the base (Silves sandstones), overlain by variated mudstones interbedded 

with siltstones and dolomites. On top of these strata, to the south of the E-W trending Algibre 

Fault, there are thick evaporitic deposits, whereas north of this major structure, the evaporites 

are virtually absent. These strata are overlain by volcanic rocks associated with the Central 

Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) (Martins et al., 2008; Verati et al., 2007). The Lower 

Jurassic Algarve CAMP magmatism was dated by the 40Ar/39Ar method at 198.1±1.6 to 198.4 

± 2.8 Ma (Verati et al., 2007). It consists of subaerial lava flows, peperites and pyroclastic 

deposits, and contemporaneous resedimented volcanic material (Martins et al., 2008). Some 

sedimentary layers are interbedded with effusive and explosive volcanic products which are 

indicative of coeval volcanism and sedimentation (Martins et al., 2008). The CAMP mark the 

end of the first phase of rifting in the Algarve Basin. After this important magmatic episode, 

marine carbonate sedimentation became well-established across the Algarve Basin between 

the Sinemurian to Tithonian (199-145 Ma).  During this interval, lateral facies changes in the 

limestone facies across the basin allow its division into the Western (Sagres), the Budens-

Lagoa, and the Eastern (Faro) sub-basins (Mannupella et al., 1988). These small sub-basins 

are separated by major north-south trending faults, which were probably active during 

deposition. Three main sedimentary cycles separated by regional unconformities related either 

to global sea level variations or to regional tectonic events (Mouterde, 1971; Mannupella et 

al., 1988; Terrinha et al., 2002) are recognized in the Jurassic marine carbonates of the 

Algarve Basin. There is evidence of extensional tectonism associated with four rifting phases 

which are in turn associated with four mega-sedimentary cycles: three in the Jurassic (Lower, 

Medium and Upper) and one in the Lower Cretaceous (Mannupela et al., 1988). The main 



 
CHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING “An Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and 
provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)” 

	
   26	
  

carbonate lithologies found in the Algarve Basin are shallow water limestones, sometimes 

with coral and sponge bioherms, pelagic limestones marls, bioherms and dolomites (e.g. 

Manuppella et al., 1988; Oliveira, 1992).  

The Lower Cretaceous sedimentary interval is represented by a mixed carbonate and 

siliciclastic succession (Rey, 2006) which attains its maximum thickness (ca. 1500 m) in the 

central Algarve. The basal units consists of marls and dolomites that rest conformably on 

Upper Jurassic limestones. These are followed by marls, dolomites, sandstones and 

mudstones that were deposited in nearshore and continental settings. During the Aptian to 

Albian interval (125-101 Ma), depositional conditions become more uniform across the basin, 

resulting in the accumulation of variated muds of possible lagoonal origin (the Aptian Luz 

Marls). 

Miocene strata were deposited unconformably over the Mesozoic sequences in sedimentary 

basins controlled by Alpine tectonics. The main phase of inversion of the Mesozoic strata 

occurred during Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic times (Kullberg et al., 1992, Terrinha, 1998), 

synchronous with igneous activity associated with the Monchique Alkaline Complex. 

Although the main batholith of the Monchique Alkaline Complex intrudes only greywackes 

and shales of the Brejeira formation, minor intrusions related to the Monchique Syenite dyke 

swarm intrude the Algarve Basin succession, especially in the Western Sub-Basin 

(Manuppela et al., 1998) as in the case of the Ponta das Ferrarias Intrusion near Lagos 

(Henriques, 1954). Plio-Quaternary clastic deposits unconformably overlie the Palaeozoic, 

Mesozoic and Miocene strata, and exhibit sedimentary facies consistent with eustatic sea-

level changes related to Late Cenozoic climatic fluctuations (Moura, 1998).  

2.1.5 Monchique Alkaline Complex 

  
The Monchique Alkaline Complex (MAC) is located in South Portugal and was intruded into 

the shales and greywackes of the Brejeira Formation (Fig. 2.1C and 2.4). The MAC shows a 

sub-elliptical shape of nearly 80 km2 and defines two main hills: Foia (902 m) in the western 

part and Picota (773 m) in the eastern part. The host rocks are truncated by the intrusive 

complex, except in the western and eastern extremes where the regional structure of the host 

rock is sub-parallel to the contact with the MAC (Valadares, 2004).  

The MAC is composed by multiple intrusions of nepheline syenite, intermediate and

provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)” 

	
   27	
  

ultrabasic rocks and several brecciated formations (Valadares, 2004). The MAC has been 

dated by several methods giving a Late Cretaceous age of ca. 72 Ma: (K-Ar 72±2 Ma- 

MacIntyre &amp;amp; Berger, 1982; Rb-Sr 72±1.5 Ma-Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997, 72±2 Ma-Rock, 

1978; Amphibole 72.7±2.7 Ma-Miranda et al., 2009; Whole rock 71.5±3.6 Ma-Miranda et al., 

2009).  It is part of the Iberian Alkaline Igneous Province that includes other intrusions of the 

same age such as Sines and Sintra (Rock, 1982; MacIntyre &amp;amp; Berger, 1982). The intrusion 

has created a halo of contact metamorphism of a uniform thickness of 200 m, except in the 

northwest sector where it is up to 1 km wide (Valadares, 2004).

2.2 PREVIOUS WORK IN THE STUDIED AREA 

2.2.1 Maturation studies 
 

Several maturation works have been published on the studied area, mainly on organic 

maturation but also with some studies on clay crystallinity. A comprehensive study of the 

thermal history of the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group was published by McCormack et al. 

(2007), determining a mean vitrinite reflectance (VR) of 4.28% Rr for this domain and 

suggesting that the timing of maturation was post-Variscan deformation, within the late 

Carboniferous–late Triassic interval due the relatively low VR values os Triassic samples (1.1 

% Rr). 

In the Tercenas Formation and in the Viséan Murração Formation from Southwest Portugal 

Domain, a few samples indicate maturation levels of ca. 3.2% Rr (McCormack, 1998; 



 
CHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING “An Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and 
provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)” 

	
   28	
  

McCormack et al. 2007). In the Carrapateira Group, also from the Southwest Portugal 

Domain, the maturation levels range from 2.5-4% Rr (Moço et al., 1998). These values for 

the Southwest Portugal Domain are lower than the mean maturation value of c. 4.83% Rr for 

the younger Brejeira Formation of the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group (Fernandes et al., 2012).  

In the Pyrite Belt in the São Domingos mine area, the VR values range from 4.6 to 5.2% Rr, 

indicating a meta-anthracite coal rank (Pereira et al. 2006). 

Diagenetic and metamorphic conditions within the South Portuguese Zone have also been 

studied by means of clay mineral crystallinity (Munhá, 1983, 1990; McCormack, 1998; Abad 

et al., 2001). These studies show a decrease in crystallinity from epizone conditions in the NE 

to the late diagenetic zone in the SW. Vitrinite reflectance of the organic matter from the 

flysch successions of the Pulo do Lobo Antiform indicates that meta- anthracite coal rank was 

attained post-late Devonian (Pereira et al., 2006). 

Fernandes et al. (2012) revised the maturation values in the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group in 

order to better constraint the timing of maturation. There was no observal increase in VR in 

the studied borehole, which did not allow a meaningful regional palaeogeothermal gradient 

calculation to be made for the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group. The Baixo Altentejo Flysch 

Group in general does not display any great variability in VR, with Rr ranging from 3.80 to 

5.55% and there is not clear any correlation between the Rr means in the three formations 

investigated. The mean peak palaeotemperatures for the Mértola, Mira and Brejeira 

formations are 311, 302 and 310 °C respectively. Fernandes et al. (2012) suggested that the 

attainment of peak temperatures during late Pennsylvanian times was as a consequence of 

simple pre-tectonic burial in a high geothermal gradient context and that during the Variscan 

deformation the temperatures remained high but did not exceed the maximum attained prior 

to deformation. The advective heating by hot fluids expelled during Variscan folding and 

thrusting produced relatively uniform high temperatures in the upper crust and may 

overprinted any existing vertical VR gradient. The evidence for high temperatures having 

been maintained for some time after deformation is provided by the similarity of vitrinite 

reflectance in Carboniferous rocks at the surface. The anomalously low maturity of platform-

facies rocks in the Aljezur–Bordeira antiforms may be a consequence of this area having been 

a ‘sink’ for descending, relatively cool fluids Fernandes et al. (2012). 

More recently Fernandes et al. (2013) published a comprehensive study of the thermal history 



 
CHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING “An Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and 
provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)” 

	
   29	
  

of Algarve Basin. It was observed in the entire Algarve Basin that maturation levels increase 

with the increasing age of the strata, indicating that burial was the main process controlling 

maturation. The values of vitrinite reflectance range from 0.52-0.7% Rr in the Lower 

Cretaceous to 1-1.1% Rr in the Upper Triassic Hettangian. The Miocene rocks that 

unconformably overlie the Mesozoic strata are immature, showing values of 0.42 and 0.47% 

Rr. The palaeogeothermal maximum gradients in the onshore Algarve Basin range from 52 º 

C/km in Sagres-Lagos to 24.7 ºC/km in Faro area.  The author suggests that peak 

temperatures of all the stratigraphic units were attained in latest Cretaceous time. Regarding 

the VR values, the estimated thicknesses of cover removed is ca. 800 m in the Sagres-Lagos 

area and ca. 4 000 m in the Faro area suggest either continuous sedimentation in the Algarve 

Basin through much of the Late Cretaceous or a substantial section eroded at the base of the 

Miocene unconformity.  

2.2.2 Low-temperature thermochronology studies 
  

Stapel (1999) undertook an apatite fission track study along a profile across the Algarve and 

Sierra Morena (Spain) in order to analyse if the different geophysical characteristics of the 

West and Central Iberian Regions are also expressed in its cooling history. His study covers 

the South Portuguese, Ossa Morena and Central Iberian Zones. The fission track ages 

establish a clear difference between the South Portuguese Zone and the Central Iberian Zone. 

The South Portuguese Zone shows fission track ages and track lengths of 111.6±9.83 Ma and 

13.81±1.04µm and 113.3±9.77 Ma.  The Ossa Morena Zone shows a dispersion of apatite 

fission track ages (55.98±3.94 Ma, 69.94±6.52 Ma and 113.7±17.1 Ma) with a Cenozoic 

component not present in the South Portuguese Zone.  The confined track lengths have the 

same order of magnitude that in the South Portuguese zone, with values of 13.43±1.17 µm  

and 13.63±1.14 µm in the samples with a Cenozoic age. The forward modeling results 

indicate that the fission track age records an actual cooling event, namely a rapid cooling 

around 120 Ma and an recent cooling episode related to an uplift phase from 40 Ma until 

present.  

 

Valadares (2004) report apatite fission track ages from the Monchique Alkaline Complex of 

72.5±2.8 Ma, with confined fission tracks lengths of 13.68±0.22 µm. This value is coincident 

with the emplacement of Monchique at ca. 72 Ma (Rock, 1978; Miranda et al, 2009). The 

authors suggest several phenomena that could yield a fission track age which is identical to 



 
CHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING “An Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and 
provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)” 

	
   30	
  

the emplacement age: (1) the intrusion occurred in low depth crust levels; (2) heat dissipation 

through convection processes; (3) convection of fluids that removed the thermal anomaly 

associated with intrusion; (4) a compressive stage between the Cenomanian and Paleogene 

that rapidly uplifted the Monchique Alkaline Complex through the apatite partial annealing 

zone. 

2.2.3 Previous provenance studies on the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group  
 

Early provenance studies of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group from South Portuguse Zone 

mostly employed palaeocurrent and petrographic analysis (Boogaard, 1967; Schermerhorn, 

1971; Oliveira &amp;amp; Wagner Genthis, 1983; Moreno, 1988, 1993; Moreno &amp;amp; Sáez, 1989). 

Palaeocurrent analyses from the Mértola Formation exhibit a complex pattern with 

predominant flow directions from the north (Oliveira &amp;amp; Wagner Genthis, 1983). The sparse 

palaeocurrent data from the Mira Formation indicate that the predominant flow directions 

were towards the northwest (Oliveira &amp;amp; Wagner Genthis, 1983). The Brejeira Formation 

exhibits flow directions mainly to the southeast and east with some paleocurrent 

measurements indicating flow towards the southwest and north (Oliveira &amp;amp; Wagner Genthis, 

1983).  

Early petrographic analyses of the Mértola Formation suggested that most of the lithic clasts 

were derived from the Phyllite Quartzite Group and Volcano-Sedimentary Complex 

(Boogaard, 1967), with also a small contribution from the southwest border of the Ossa 

Morena Zone (Oliveira &amp;amp; Wagner Genthis, 1983). Moreno (1988, 1993) and Moreno and 

Sáez (1989) infer that two coeval turbidite systems fed the Mértola Formation derived from 

two different sources (the Ossa Morena Zone and the Pyrite Belt). However, reworked 

Cambrian to Early Devonian palynomorphs commonly occur in the Brejeira Formation 

(Pereira, 1999) and indicate a source area for this stratigraphic unit from outside the South 

Portuguese Zone, as no rocks older than the Mid-Devonian crop out within the South 

Portuguese Zone. 

Jorge et al. (2013) undertook a comprehensive major- and trace-element geochemistry study 

on all three formations of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group. This study concluded that the 

source area for the sedimentary rocks of the Mértola and Mira formations was derived mainly 

from the SW border of the Ossa Morena Zone (Fig. 1).  The provenance of the youngest 

Brejeira Formation was suggested to be either from an internal orogenic source alone or with 



 
CHAPTER II-GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND SAMPLING “An Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and 
provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)” 

	
   31	
  

a contribution from an external source, possibly Avalonia. Although the second scenario was 

favoured by Jorge et al. (2013), this question remains open. 

U-Pb detrital zircon analyses that have been undertaken on the Mértola Formation rocks 

suggest that the Iberian Pyrite Belt and the internal zones of the Ossa Morena Zone were the 

main sources (Jorge, 2009; Pereira et al., 2012). However, there are presently no U-Pb detrital 

zircon data from the other formations of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group and the provenance 

and evolution of the group as a whole remains uncertain. In recent years several U-Pb zircon 

dating studies have been undertaken on the Ossa Morena Zone (e.g. Cordani et al., 2006), the 

Volcano-Sedimentary Complex of the Iberian Pyrite Belt (e.g. Rosa et al., 2009) and the 

different domains of the South Portuguese Zone (Jorge, 2009; Braid et al., 2011; Pereira et 

al., 2012). In this work we present U-Pb detrital zircon data from the Mértola, Mira and 

Brejeira formations of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group. The aim of this study is to compare 

the U-Pb detrital zircon data with the different models proposed for the provenance of the 

Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group in order to further constrain the tectonic setting of this 

Carboniferous basin in the context of the evolution of the SW Iberian Variscides. 

2.3.2 Provenance studies on Upper Triassic Silves Sandstones in Algarve Basin 
 

In the Algarve Basin, the siliciclastic sediments of the Upper Triassic termed the Silves 

Sandstones (Rocha, 1976), are comprised of sandstones and conglomerates with oblique 

stratification and lenticular structures (Palain, 1976). These sediments were deposited in a 

fluvial sedimentary environment and were associated with numerous alluvial fans deposited 

on Variscan basement (Palain, 1976). Palaeocurrents indicate a sedimentary provenance 

mainly from the NE to SW and is assumed that the Variscan basement was the main 

sedimentary source for the Silves Sandstones (Palain, 1976). The lack of isotopic ages from 

the Upper Triassic makes its provenance an open question.  

2.3 SAMPLING  
 

Sampling was carried out in three campaigns during the first year of work. The sampling 

campaigns were designed to complement the existing and published thermochronology, 

organic maturation and provenance data.

2.3.1 Organic Maturation Sampling 
 

A total of forty-two samples were collected from outcrops (fig. 2.2, 2.3) in the Baixo Alentejo 

Flysch Group, in the Algarve Basin and in the Permian Viar Basin to constrain the maximum 

temperatures attained and to allow a better understanding of the thermal history (including the 

planned fission tracks results) and also to increase the geographic spread of the existing 

organic maturity database. A total of ten samples from two mineral exploration boreholes 

(CST1 and CT1) located in the Mértola Formation from South Portuguese Zone were also 

sampled (see point 2.3.3). The lithologies sampled were shales, mudstones and clays. Where 

possible, the samples were collected at localities where low-thermochronology samples were 

taken (see 2.3.2). In the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group, two samples were taken from the 

Mértola Formation, three from the Mira Formation and five from the Brejeira Formation 

(table 1, fig. 2.2). In the Permian Viar Basin, five samples were collected (table 2.1, fig. 2.4). 

In the Algarve Basin four samples were collected in Lower cretaceous Sobral formation in 

Faro sub-basin. Other twenty-three outcrop samples were collected from the Lower 

Cretaceous Luz Marls and Mudstones located near the ca. 150 m thick basic intrusion at 

Ponta das Ferrarias at the eastern end of the Praia da Luz (Lagos) in the eastern Algarve sub-

basin (table 2.1, fig. 2.2). The samples were collected in the same layer, at different distances 

from the intrusion as shown in figure 2.5.

2.3.2 Sampling for low-temperature thermochronology, geochronology and provenance 
studies  
 

A total of fifty-five outcrop samples were collected for low-temperature thermochronology, 

geochronology and sedimentary provenance studies. The lithologies sampled were 

greywackes, quartz-greywackes, sandstones, quartzites, dolerites, granites and syenites (table 

2.2). The samples were collected mainly for low-temperature thermochronology studies and, 

when possible and the mineral content were adequate, were also used for U-Pb geochronology 

and sedimentary provenance studies. A total of twelve samples from two mineral exploration 

boreholes (CST1 and CT1) located in the South Portuguese Zone were also sampled (see 

point 2.3.3).  

The samples were collected in order to make a “transect” that covered the Ossa Morena Zone 

through the South Portuguese Zone, crossing the Monchique Alkaline Complex and into the 

Algarve Basin. The “transect” is not a straight line but often consists of several samples 

collected from the oldest to youngest formations in a given region as shown in figure 2.2. 

Although the Ossa Morena Zone is not one of the objectives of this study, in order to control 

the relative movements between the Ossa Morena Zona and the South Portuguese Zone, two 

samples from Late Variscan granites (PIAS1 and LP1) and two samples from the Beja 

Igneous domain (CB1 and CB2) were sampled (fig. 2.2 and 2.3 and table 2.2). In the Permian 

Viar basin two samples were collected, one from coarse tuffs (VLC4) and another from a red 

sandstones (VLC7).  In the Monchique Alkaline Complex three samples were collected at 

different altitudes and from distinct units. One sample was collected from the highest point 

(MM2) in a central unit of nepheline syanite with intergranular texture. The other two 

samples were collected from the border unit of nepheline syanite in the contact with the 

country rock (MM1) and in a quarry (MMP1) (Table 2.2, fig. 2.4).  

In an attempt to constrain the thermal history of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group prior to the 

deposition of Algarve basin sediments and also to constrain the thermal history of the base 

units of the Algarve Basin, several samples were collected along the angular unconformity 

between these two units. The samples were collected along the unconformity from west to 

east. Five samples (TL1, SL2, QR2, SC2 and CM2) are from the Upper Triassic Silves 

sandstones of the Algarve Basin. The other five samples are from greywackes from the 

Brejeira formation (TL1, BA2), the Mira Formation (QR1, SC1, CM1) and the Baixo 

Alentejo Flysch Group (table 2.2 and fig 2.2 and 2.6).

Other samples from the Lower Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous in the Algarve Basin were 

collect from different locations (fig. 2.2 and table 2.1) in order to cover different ages in the

2.3.3 Borehole Samples 
 

Two mineral exploration boreholes were sampled (CST1 and CT1, see fig. 2.2 for location). 

The borehole CST1 (Corte de São Tomé) (fig. 2.6) was drilled by Billiton Portuguesa-

Desenvolvimento Lda. in 1984 and it reached a depth of 890 m. The upper 717 m consists of 

interbedded shales and greywackes of the Mértola Formation of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch 

Group. Below 717 m the succession comprises shales and fine to coarse volcaniclastic rocks 

of the Volcano-Sedimentary Complex of the Iberian Pyrite Belt. The borehole CT1 (Cotovio) 

(fig. 2.6) was drilled by AGC-Minas de Portugal, Lda in 2008 and it reached a depth of 1888 

m. The upper 692 m consists of interbedded shales and greywackes of the Mértola Formation 

of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group. Below 692 m the succession comprises shales and fine 

to coarse volcaniclastic rocks of the Volcano-Sedimentary Complex of the Iberian Pyrite Belt. 

Below 1176 m the degree of chloritization increases and jasper and chert horizons are 

common. The Mértola Formation was extensively sampled with shale samples taken in 

spaced regular intervals for vitrinite reflectance studies and greywackes for low-temperature 

thermochronology studies (fig. 2.6 and table 2.1 and 2.2). Only two shale samples and one 

greywacke were collected in the borehole CST1 in the Volcano-Sedimentary Complex.

III–FUNDAMENTALS OF APPLIED TECHNIQUES  
 

The aim of this chapter is to introduce some of the analytical techniques used in the following 

chapters. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to give a detailed and in-depth description of 

the principles behind each methodology used. However, the key references for each method 

are given in the follow sections. The instrumental procedures are described in the chapters 

corresponding to each method.  

3.1 VITRINITE REFLECTANCE  
 

The term vitrinite was first proposed as a maceral group by Stopes (1935). In incident light 

microscopy the organic matter components, macerals, are identified on the basis of their 

optical properties. They are very common in coals and are also found in sedimentary rocks as 

dispersed organic matter. Macerals are microscopic organic entities derived from terrestrial, 

lacustrine and marine plant remains and are modified by deposition processes, early 

diagenesis and subsequent thermal evolution (Suárez-Ruiz et al., 2012). There are three 

maceral groups: huminite/vitrinite, liptinite and inertinite. In this chapter only vitrinite will be 

discussed. Vitrinite can be defined chemically as an organic compound formed by 

polyaromatic nuclei, heteroatomic ketone and carboxyl groups which are surrounded by 

peripheral aliphatic chains. The exact proprieties of vitrinite depend on their origin, namely if 

it is derived from lignin or cellulose, or a combination of both. The amount of biodegradation 

that occurs during the early stages of organic diagenesis is also important (Fermont, 1988). 

The initial chemical composition of the botanical vitrinite percursors and the amount of initial 

biodegradation are important and influence the vitrinite reflectance. The reflectance increase 

observed in vitrinite is intrinsically related to the chemical changes that occur in its structure 

during coalification. The chemical structure of vitrinite can be represented by several 

“clusters” of condensed aromatic rings linked with chains and stacked on top of one another. 

With increasing maturity, these “clusters” fuse together into larger, condensed aromatic ring 

structures. Eventually, they form sheets of condensed rings that assume an orderly structure. 

Both the increases in the size of these sheets and their preferred orientation cause greater 

reflectivity (Stachs et al., 1982). Other chemical changes that occur during coalification 

include the increase in the carbon content of vitrinite and a progressive decrease in the oxygen

provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)” 
	
  

	
   39	
  

and hydrogen content. The chemical reactions as vitrinite undergoes increasing maturation are 

also responsible for the anisotropy observed at higher ranks.  

Temperature is considered to be the principal factor that controls the increase of vitrinite 

reflectance, although other factors do have some effects, like stress, time and pressure 

(Murchinson et al., 1985). Chemical reactions which affect vitrinite particles during organic 

maturation are irreversible and their reaction rates rise exponentially with a linear rise in 

temperature. Consequently, the increase in the magnitude of vitrinite reflectance also 

increases exponentially with a linear rise in temperature.   

Cook (1991) compiled some of the main distinguishing features of vitrinite from other 

maceral groups. One of these features is primarily based on its morphology. In sections 

perpendicular to bedding, most vitrinite occurs as elongate lenses. In sections parallel to 

bedding the vitrinite particles are commonly more equidimensional and are less likely to show 

rounded outlines. Other distinguishing proprieties are the reflectance and the 

autofluorescence. At low and medium ranks, vitrinite has a reflectance higher than that of 

liptinite macerals and lower than that of inertinite macerals. In the middle and upper ranks the 

liptinite reflectance converges on that of vitrinite. Within the anthracite range, the maximum 

reflectance of vitrinite converges on that of the macerals of the inertinite group, but the 

minimum reflectance of vitrinite remains less than that of inertinite macerals. Bireflectance of 

vitrinite is low at low ranks but becomes distinct in the middle and upper part of the bitumous 

coal rank range. Within the semi-anthracite, anthracite and meta-anthracide rank range, 

bireflectance become high to extreme and is an important feature for vitrinites in this rank 

range. Over the whole range of coal rank in any given sample, vitrinite typically shows a 

much lower dispersion of maximum reflectance about the mean that the other maceral groups, 

which is another property that shows the importance of its use. Over the rank range from 1 to 

about 1.8 % the reflectance dispersion, which is generally low for vitrinite, becomes an 

important property in distinguishing vitrinite. When the vitrinite reflectance becomes greater 

than about 2.0 %, its distinctive bireflectance becomes a major feature to aid in the distinction 

of vitrinite from inertinite, except in the case of some thermally altered rocks. The relief is 

another distinctive feature of vitrinite macerals. At low and medium ranks the vitrinite 

exhibits negative polishing relief compared with other macerals. Over the rank range from 1 

% to about 1.8 % the polishing relief of vitrinite increases and vitrinite has a tendency to 

fracture in compactation structures.

In summary, there are several characteristics of vitrinite that make it an excellent 

palaeotemperature indicator: 

 

- Vitrinite reflectance may be considered a non-retrogressive palaeogeothermometer for low-

grade metamorphic conditions (Stach et al., 1982); 

- Vitrinite is distributed in a wide range of sedimentary facies and may be obtained from a 

wide range of lithologies (Dow &amp;amp; O’Connor, 1982); 

- Measurement of vitrinite reflectance is precise and standardised by the international 

guidelines of the ICCP (2001); 

- The vitrinite reflectance technique is relatively cheap, easy and quick to measure and the 

results are reproducible; 

- The reflectance of vitrinite increases more uniformly through the entire coal rank range than 

any other maceral group (Stach et al., 1982); 

- Reflectance is an objective parameter and is measured on a numerical scale and not 

estimated like spore color; 

- Small quantities of rock (less than 50 g) generally have sufficient vitrinite grains and small 

vitrinite particles (more than 2 µm) can be measured; 

- At high ranks (above 2,5 % Rm), vitrinite reflectance is essentially the only quantitative 

microscopic parameter that can be used to determine levels of organic maturation.  

 

3.2 LOW-TEMPERATURE THERMOCHRONOLOGY: APATITE FISSION TRACK  

 

Uranium is a radioactive element that decays by ? and ? emission but a small proportion of 
238U also decays by spontaneous fission. The Fission-track (FT) method is based on the 

accumulation of narrow damage trails (fission-tracks) in uranium-rich mineral grains, which 

form as a result of spontaneous nuclear fission decay of 238U in nature (Fleischer &amp;amp; Hart, 

1972). Nuclear fission is a process during which a heavy, unstable nucleus splits into a pair of 

fragments of similar size with the release of a few neutrons and energy that results from the 

kinetic energy of the fission fragments (Tagami &amp;amp; O’Sullivan, 2005). The fission fragments 

with massive positive charges are propelled from reaction site in opposite direction creating a 

damage trail (FT) along the trajectories of the two fragments (Tagami &amp;amp; O’Sullivan, 2005). 

The cross section of the track has a nearly circular shape of 6-10 nm diameter in apatite 

mineral grains (Paul et al., 1993). For its entire range, the track is a cylinder over a certain 



 
CHAPTER III- FUNDAMENTALS OF APPLIED TECHNICS “An Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and 
provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)” 
	
  

	
   41	
  

length and tapers down in diameter near its end (Dunlap et al., 1997) in one or both terminals 

of a fission track (Carlson et al., 1990). Fission tracks are originally 10–20 µm long and their 

initial length depends on the density of the crystal lattice (?16 µm in apatite). Owing to their 

narrow width, fission tracks in their natural state (‘latent’ tracks) are visible only using 

transmission electron microscopy (Paul &amp;amp; Fitzgerald, 1992). However they can be ‘revealed’ 

to become visible under an optical microscope with ?1000 x magnification, by polishing and 

chemically etching the surface of the crystal.  

Since each spontaneous fission event creates one fission track, the track density is a function 

of the rate of fission decay, the concentration of 238U and the fission-track age of the sample 

(Braun et al., 2006). If a host rock is subjected to elevated temperatures, fission tracks that 

have been formed up to that point in time are shortened progressively and eventually erased 

by the thermal recovery of damage (Fleischer &amp;amp; Hart, 1972). This occurs by a diffusive 

process called annealing, during which atoms and electrons move through the crystal lattice 

towards the ionized track. As for all diffusive processes, fission-track annealing takes place at 

strongly temperature-dependent rates. As a result of annealing, the etchable length of a track, 

which is initially similar for all tracks in a given mineral structure, will be progressively 

shortened (Green et al., 1986; Carlson et al., 1990). Because the mean length of the tracks in 

a sample determines the probability that they intersect an internal surface, the track density 

(and thus the apparent fission-track age) is also reduced during annealing (Green, 1988). The 

temperature of total annealing for fluorapatite is 120±10 ºC. Above these temperatures, 

annealing takes place at a faster rate than track production, so the effective apatite fission-

track age remains perpetually zero. The annealing rate also depend on the crystallographic 

orientation of the tracks, with tracks orthogonal to the C-axis of the mineral annealing more 

rapidly than those parallel to the C-axis (Green et al., 1986; Donelick et al., 1999). The mean 

width of fission-track etched pits has been proposed as a proxy measure for the varying 

annealing kinetics arising from compositional and structural variation (Ketcham et al., 1999; 

Barbarand et al., 2003). Because of the chemical and crystallographic dependence of 

annealing rates, the track-length distributions (measured as the standard deviation) become 

wider and single-grain ages become more dispersed with increasing annealing. The effects of 

annealing can be quantified by measuring the lengths of horizontal confined tracks (Gleadow 

et al., 1986), i.e. tracks parallel to the polished face of the grain that do not cut the surface but 

have been etched because they intersect cracks or other tracks allowing access to the etchant.  

Confined track lengths can provide unique thermal history information. The distribution of

provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)” 
	
  

	
   42	
  

confined lengths of freshly produced induced tracks is characterized by a narrow, symmetrical 

distribution with a mean length of around 16.3 µm and a standard deviation of the distribution 

of approximately 0.9 µm. In volcanic and related rocks which have cooled very rapidly, and 

never been reheated above about 50 ºC, the distribution is also narrow and symmetric, but 

with a shorter mean length of 14.5 to 15 µm, and a standard deviation of the distribution of 

approximately 1.0 µm. In granitic basement terranes, which are thought never to have been 

significantly disturbed thermally since their original post-emplacement cooling, the 

distribution becomes negatively skewed, with a mean around 12 or 13 µm and a standard 

deviation between 1.2 and 2 µm. This distribution is thought to characterize slow continuous 

cooling from temperatures from 120ºC to ambient surface temperatures. More complex 

thermal histories produce correspondingly complex distributions of confined tracks. The 

continuous production of tracks through time, coupled with the fact that the length of each 

track shrinks to a value characteristic of the maximum temperature it has experienced, gives a 

final length distribution which directly reflects the nature of the variation of temperature with 

time. Most distinctive of the numerous possible forms of the final distribution are the bimodal 

distributions, which give clear evidence of a two-stage history, including high and low 

temperature phases.  

Over the past three decades, fission-track thermochronology has become established as a 

widely used technique for constraining the low-temperature thermal histories of rocks. 

Excellent reviews of the technique have been provided by Hurford (1983), Brown et al. 

(1994), Gallagher et al. (1998), Gleadow &amp;amp; Brown (2000) and Ravenhurst &amp;amp; Donelick 

(1992), while in-depth discussions of the theory can be found in Fleischer &amp;amp; Hart (1972) and 

Wagner and Van den Haute (1992). 

 

3.3 LOW-TEMPERATURE THERMOCHRONOLOGY: APATITE (U-Th)/He  
 

The production of 4He (? particles) from uranium (U) and thorium (Th) series decay in rocks 

and minerals was the first geochronological dating method to be proposed early in the 

twentieth century (Rutherford, 1907; Soddy, 1911,1914).  However, at that time geoscientists 

were pursuing only ‘absolute’ or formation ages of rocks, notably in a quest to constrain the 

age of the Earth (Holmes, 1913). Since He diffuses easily out of the mineral lattice (a 

phenomenon that was not very well understood at the time), ages determined using U, Th and 

He measurements were consistently much younger than those calculated using the U–Pb

couple. Interest in the technique has been revived since Zeitler et al. (1987), who proposed 

that the diffusive loss of He could be quantified and that He ages could be used to constrain 

cooling through very low temperatures. Subsequent diffusion experiments (Wolf et al., 1996; 

Farley, 2000) have demonstrated that the apatite (U–Th)/He thermochronometer is sensitive 

to temperatures as low as 40 ºC, with effective closure occurring around 70 ºC, depending on 

the cooling rate and mineral grain size. Results of several (U–Th)/He studies in boreholes 

(Warnock et al., 1997; House et al., 1999) have supported this temperature range in natural 

settings, within the uncertainty of the thermal histories experienced by the borehole samples. 

The position of the He partial-retention zone has been compared with the partial-annealing 

zone of fission tracks in apatite and it was found that their relative positions were consistent 

with the laboratory-derived estimates (Warnock et al., 1997; House et al., 1997; Stockli et al., 

2000) The low closure temperatures of the (U–Th)/He system, especially in apatite, make it 

particularly sensitive to near-surface cooling and thermal perturbations (Farley, 2000) 

Because of the high diffusivity of He through most minerals and the relative rarity of He in 

the environment, initial or excess He is usually not a concern. However, two factors are 

known to bias strongly the measured He ages: ?-ejection and (U–Th)-rich inclusions. The first 

is related to the fact that the ? particles produced by nuclear decay have a kinetic energy that 

allows them to travel up to 20 µm through the crystal lattice (Farley, 2000), and potentially to 

be ejected from the mineral. This effect is corrected for by using numerical models of ?-

ejection for simplified grain geometries and homogeneous U distributions (Farley et al., 

1996). The second potential problem is related to the fact that many apatite grains contain 

minor inclusions of actinide-rich minerals such as zircon and monazite that contribute to the 
4He abundance in the sample but, because they are not fully dissolved by the standard 

chemical dissolution methods used on apatite, do not contribute to the U and Th 

measurements. Samples that contain such inclusions will therefore present ‘parentless’ He 

and yield excessively old ages. Minimizing this problem requires very careful sample 

selection by screening every grain to be dated, for even the smallest inclusions under a high-

magnification optical microscope. 

3.4 U-Pb GEOCHRONOLOGY  
 

Uranium has three naturally occurring radioactive isotopes, 238U, 235U and 234U. Each of these 

isotopes is the parent of a chain of radioactive daughter products that ends in stable isotopes 

of Pb. None of the parent isotopes decay directly to Pb, but instead follows a sequence of

provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)”

alpha and beta decays, that create a series of intermediate daughter isotopes, and always 

ultimately result in a stable isotope of Pb (Bateman, 1910). Unlike other chronometers, the U-

Pb system exploits two independent decay schemes, 235U to 207Pb and 238U to 206Pb, where 

both the 238U and 235U decay constants are relatively precise and accurately known (Jaffey et 

al., 1971). The half-lives of 238U (ca. 4.5 Ga) and 235U (ca. 0.7 Ga) are all much longer than 

those for their respective daughters. This means that we can assume the production rate of the 

daughter product is equal to the decay rate of the parent. Therefore, the decay of U isotopes 

can be treated as though as it occurred directly to the respective Pb isotopes (Faure &amp;amp; 

Mensing, 2005). The advantage of two independent chronometers in the same mineral is that 

it is possible to detect small amounts of open system behaviour such as Pb loss or inheritance 

from an older component. The different half lives of 238U and 235U means that by the 

Neoproterozoic much smaller amounts of 235U (relative to238U) remain due to the higher 

decay rate, therefore smaller amounts 207Pb are produced per increment relative to 206Pb. 

Although all three dates can be calculated from most published analyses, the relative 

precisions are related to the analytical technique employed. When dating minerals, it is 

assumed that the system has been closed during its history, which in this case is the 

assumption of no Pb or U loss/gain. U is a mobile element in oxidizing environments, and can 

be lost during weathering. Also, radiation damage of the crystals in which the U and Pb are 

contained can facilitate Pb loss (Holmes, 1954). The effects of Pb loss on the calculated age 

can be minimised if we assume that the Pb lost has the same isotopic composition as the Pb 

that is remaining. If this is correct, we can calculate an age based on the 207Pb/206Pb ratio, 

which will be insensitive to Pb loss. Several publications which describe the U-Pb 

geochronology system in more detail include Hanchar &amp;amp; Hoskin, 2003 and Corfu, 2012.

IV – VITRINITE REFLECTANCE ANALYSES 
 

4.1 SAMPLING 
 

A total of 48 samples were collected (fig. 2.2, 2.3) to complete a large organic maturity 

dataset for the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group in the South Portuguese Zone and in the Algarve 

Basin. The samples were collected from outcrops and from two mineral exploration boreholes 

(CST1 and CT1) that intersect the Mértola Formation of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group  

and the volcano-sedimentary complex of the South Portuguese Zone (fig. 2.2, 2.6). All 

samples were mudstones and shales. The sampling strategy and the detailed description of the 

samples were described in chapter II.  The results will constrain the maximum temperatures 

attained and allow a better understanding of the thermal history including the apatite fission 

track results. A batch of samples previously collected and studied in the context of projects 

"Hydrocarbon source-rock potential of the Algarve Basin" (PTDC/CTE-GEX/72694/2006) 

and “An Integrated Research on Provenance Indicators of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group: 

Geological Histories ‘Concealed' in Sediments-PROVENANCE“ (POCI/CTE-

GEX/60278/2004) were also used for compilation and comparison of the results. The 

published results (Fernandes et al., 2012; Fernandes et al., 2013) of these two research 

projects are presented in annex I.  

4.2 SAMPLE PROCESSING  
 

The sample preparation for organic maturation analyses was undertaken in the laboratory 

facilities of University of the Algarve (UAlg). The method of sample preparation for vitrinite 

reflection studies was adapted from Fernandes (2000) and consists of two steps (fig. 4.1). The 

first part comprised the isolation and concentration of the organic residues (kerogen) from the 

rock samples using cold acids, whilst the second part consisted of mounting and polishing the 

organic residues.

the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)”

Figure 4.1 Sample preparation for vitrinite reflection studies, adapted from Fernandes (2000). 
 
Firstly, the samples were washed and crushed into small pieces (gravel sized fragments). 

Approximately 150 g of the crushed rock was put inside a teflon beaker with Hydrochloric 

acid (HCl) until all the carbonates were dissolved. Afterwards, the HCl was washed by 

successive decants and Hydrofluoric acid (HF) was added to the beaker and maintained until 

all the minerals (including silicates) were dissolved. During this stage the sample was stirred 

twice a day to ensure that the whole sample reacted with the acid. When all the mineral 

content had been dissolved, the used HF was removed by successive decants using distilled 

water in order to neutralize the organic residuum. When neutralized, the concentrated organic 

matter was wet sieved using a 15 microns mesh sieve cloth. The organic concentrate was then 

collected with a pipette and stored in small beakers. 

 

The organic matter concentrate was mounted in thin sections using the techniques adapted 

from Hillier &amp;amp; Marshall (1988). The procedures were as follows:

the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)”

1- Spray a cover slip on one side with dry lubrificant PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) and 

let it dry for a few minutes; 

2- Pipette a small quantity of the organic residue as an aqueous suspension onto the 

PTFE-coated surface of the cover slip, allowing a wide dispersion on the cover slip, 

and wait two days until it is completely dry; 

3- Label a standard glass slide with a diamond pen with the sample reference; 

4- Prepare the necessary amount of polyester resin and mix 1 % of liquid hardener. 

Gently stir to avoid the formation of air bubbles in the resin; 

5- Place a single drop of polyester resin in the centre of the slide and place the cover slip 

with its adhering organic particles on top; 

6- After two hours carefully remove the glass cover slip using a razor blade. The result is 

a thin layer of resin with embedded organic particles bonded to the frosted slide, 

showing a level, mirror-like surface; 

7- Polish by hand the slides on a cloth lap using three grades of fine alumina powder, 1, 

0.3 and 0.05 micron respectively. During the polishing stages and at the end, the slides 

are cleaned using cold tap water. When the polishing is complete the slides are dried 

with a hair dryer. 

 

The vitrinite measurements were made using an Olympus BX51 reflected light microscope, 

equipped with an Olympus/SIS CView 3 high-resolution digital colour camera. The vitrinite 

reflectance (VR) measurements were made using the image processing modules supplied with 

Matlab® in the Mirone suite (Luis, 2007). This graphical tool calibrates a scale of 256 grey 

levels with standards of know reflectivity. The standards used in this study have a reflectivity 

of 0.428, 0.595, 1.715, 3.15 and 5.37, for incident light with a wavelength of 546 nm and 

immersed in a oil with a refraction index of 1.518 at 20 ºC (room temperature). The greyscale 

images of the vitrinite particles are imported to this routine and the reflectance values are 

measured. Whenever possible, a total of 100 vitrinite particles were measured. When the lack 

of vitrinite particles did not allow this number of analyses to be acheived, a minimum of 30 

VR measurements was accepted as statically valid (Mackowsky, 1982; McCormack, 1998, 

Fernandes et al., 2013). 

Mean random vitrinite reflectance (%Rr) was the vitrinite reflectance (VR) parameter chosen 

for maturation because the mounting technique that was used provides non-oriented vitrinite 

particles, and also because %Rr is the most widely used organic maturation parameter in the

oil industry and is readily correlated with other maturity parameters (Fernandes et al., 2013). 

The VR values measured are projected in histograms (annex II) using the “DataGraph®” 

software that also calculates the mean and standard deviation. The arithmetic mean was 

considered to be the true vitrinite reflectance value for the sample. The palaeotemperatures of 

the samples were calculated using an empirical equation described by Barker (1988) that 

correlates VR values with peak temperatures attained by the samples during burial: 

         T(ºC)=104ln(Ro+148)                                                   (1) 

where T is the maximum palaeotemperature attained by the rock and Ro the VR value 

measured. 

4.3 VITRINITE REFLECTANCE RESULTS AND MODELATION 

4.3.1 Borehole results (CST1 and CT1) 
 

The two boreholes located in the South Portuguese Zone intersect the Mértola Formation of 

the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group and the Volcano-Sedimentary Complex of the Iberian Pyrite 

Belt (see chapter II for more details). Eleven samples from CST1 and eight from CT1 provide 

measurable vitrinite particles. The results are show in the table 4.1.

calculated using the equation by Barker (1988). Rr(%) - vitrinite reflectance values in percentage, SD-standard 
deviation, n-number of vitrinite particles measured. 

 

 
In borehole CST1, the vitrinite reflectance (VR) ranges from 3.78 to 5.74 %. VR values do 

not show any increase with the depth through the 677 m of the section. Peak

paleotemperatures calculated using the empirical Barker equation give a range of maximum 

temperatures between 295 and 322 ºC. In borehole CT1 the same trend evident in borehole 

CST1 is observed. The VR values range between 3.94 and 5.3 %. VR values do not show any 

increase with the depth through the 584 m of section. The peak temperatures give a range of 

maximum temperatures between 290 and 321 ºC. The lack of downhole increase in VR in 

both boreholes hampers the calculation of palaeogeothermal gradients for the boreholes. 

These results are in agreement with the values for the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group presented 

by Fernandes et. al (2012), Fernandes (2000) and McCormack (1999). The 

palaeotemperatures determined clearly show that these lithologies had passed through the 

temperature windows  that reset the low-thermochronometers applied in this study.  

4.3.2 Results from Outcrop Samples 
 

In order to compare the VR results with the low-thermochronology studies, ten outcrop 

samples were collected, where possible, from the same outcrops where the samples for 

thermochronology were collected. (fig. 2.2). 

 

In the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group the vitrinite reflectance values range between 2.34 and 

5.57, with a highest value (12.94 %) measured from shales of the Brejeira Formation, located 

near the intrusive contact of the Monchique Alkaline Complex (MAC) (fig. 2.4). The VR 

values measured from the outcrops correspond to paleotemperatures between 236 and 326 ºC, 

whereas near the MAC the paleotemperatures reach a maximum of 414 ºC.  

The samples from the Cretaceous strata have a value of 0.69 %Rr, corresponding to a 

maximum palaeotemperature of 109 ºC.

using the equation by Barker (1988). Rr(%) – vitrinite reflectance values in percentage, SD-standard deviation, 
n-number of vitrinite particles measured. 

 

 

Besides the set of samples collected from the outcrops, a batch of twenty-three samples were 

collected from the Lower Cretaceous Luz Mudstones located near the ca. 150 m basic 

intrusion at Ponta das Ferrarias near Lagos (fig. 2.5). These samples were collected in order to 

assess the effect of the intrusion on the regional vitrinite reflectance values. 

Assuming that the heat flux associated to the igneous intrusion has a symmetrical behaviour 

either side of the intrusion, samples were collected from the same layer located on the western 

side of the intrusion and from a distance of ca. 2 km as shown on figure 4.1. The results are 

presented in figure 4.2 and table 3.3. At the contact with the intrusion the VR reaches a 

maximum value of 1.68 %. The values decrease to 1.1 % at 30 cm from the contact. After this 

point the VR have some small variations but the main trend is a gradual decrease with the 

increase in distance from the intrusion, until approximately 2 km the background VR value of 

0.66 % described by Fernandes et al. (2012) for this area is reached. A possible explanation 

for the variations in VR values near the contact with the intrusion could be related to the 

dissipation of heat by the percolation of water along faults and along the contact due to the 

differences in permeability between the igneous rocks and the mudstones. Raymond &amp;amp; 

Murchison (1988) state that the degree of sediment compaction, the volume of pore water and 

the initial maturation level of the organic matter at the time of magmatic intrusion influence 

the variations in VR more significantly than does the magma temperature.

The thermal response of the Praia da Luz Marls to the igneous intrusion was modelled using a 

simple Matlab® script (Ehlers &amp;amp; Farley, 2003). The model use the assumption that the heat 

loss from magmatic bodies primarily occurs through conduction (Spear, 1993) and due to the 

finite shape of the magmatic bodies, the thermal evolution of a magmatic body and its 

surrounding area can be quantified in 1D assuming: (1) the emplacement of magmatic bodies 

occur rapidly compared to the post-emplacement thermal equilibration of the surrounding 

country rock; (2) the geometry of the magmatic bodies are small (less than 10km); (3) the 

latent heat of fusion from the conversion of melt to crytsallized rock is neglected to quantify

the first-order consequence of magmatism (Ehlers &amp;amp; Farley, 2003). It is also assumed that the 

intrusion is planar with a width L.  A coordinate system with the origin in the centre of the 

intrusion is employed. The initial conditions used by the model are at time t = 0 the 

temperature T equals the intrusion Ti within and at the edges of the intrusion [-(L/2)&lt;z&lt;(L/2)] 

and the temperature Tb equals the background country rock temperature at distances 

[(L/2)&lt;z&lt;-(L/2)]. With these conditions the equation used in the model is given by Carslaw &amp;amp;

where erf is the error function and z is measured as the distance from the center of intrusion. 

The model allows for the introduction of boundary conditions such as the intrusion width, 

intrusion temperature, country rock temperatures and thermal diffusivity. 

 

The intrusion at Ponta das Ferrarias is described as hypabyssal and resulted from multiple 

crystallization phases (Henriques, 1954). In the model the intrusion was assumed to be 

shallow and into country rocks with a background temperature of ca. 100 ºC (Fernandes et al., 

2013). Due to multiple intrusion phases an initial temperature of 500 ºC was assumed. A 

thermal diffusivity of 32 km2Ma-1 was also assumed for modelling proposes. Figure 4.3A and 

4.3B show the results of the thermal evolution model of the Ponta das Ferrarias intrusion as 

well as the thermal evolution of the country rocks. The results of the modelling show that 

between 20 and 1000 years after the emplacement of the intrusion, the temperature in the 

centre of the intrusion decreased from ca. 500 ºC to ca. 200 ºC. Whereas, in the wall of the 

intrusion (75 m from the centre) the temperature decrease from ca. 275 ºC to 190 ºC. During 

the same period the country rock temperatures at a distance &amp;lt;2 km increase from a 

temperature of 100 ºC to near 275 ºC at the contact with the intrusion and decrease back 

towards to the background temperature at 2 km distance. The temperature at the contact 

remains elevated (30 ºC) above the background temperature after 10 000 years. After 0.1 Ma 

the temperature at the contact is only 10 ºC above the background temperature and at 1 Ma 

the temperature had equilibrated with the background temperature. In the country rocks at a 

distance of 1 km from the intrusion, the temperature increased in the first 10 000 years to a 

value ca. 14 ºC above the background temperature. After 0.1 Ma the temperature remains 9 ºC

higher that the background temperature and had completely equilibrated 1 Ma after 

emplacement.  

  

 
Figure 4.3 Thermal evolution model of the Ponta das Ferrarias intrusion as well as the thermal evolution of the 
country rocks. 
 

If we compare the measured palaeotemperature data with the modeled temperature results  

(fig. 4.4) it is clear that the response of vitrinite was not instantaneous with the increase of 

temperature associated with the emplacement of the igneous rocks. The VR measurements 

fall between the modelling VR curves corresponding to results between 1000 and 10 000 

years after the intrution, indicating a short heating event.

Fernandes et al. (2013) suggested that the high palaeogeothermal gradient of ca. 52 ºC km-1 

calculated for the Sagres-Lagos region in the western part of the Algarve Basin, could be 

attributed to the conductive heating related to Late Cretaceous igneous activity. For the 

parameters used in the modelling, equilibrium between the intrusion and the country rocks 

was attained 0.1 My after the intrusion. These results show that the VR values for the country 

rocks were attained before the intrusion as stated by Fernandes et al. (2013) and the thermal 

effect of the intrusion is restricted to an area near the contact. Nevertheless, it is not 

conclusive if the Cretaceous intrusions may have affected the geothermal gradient in the 

Western part of the Algarve Basin on a more regional scale.  

4.4 SUMMARY  
 

Fernandes et al. (2012) suggested that the maximum burial temperatures in the Baixo 

Alentejo Flysch Group from the South Portuguese Zone were between 276–325 °C and they 

were achieved prior to Variscan deformation but remained high during and after deformation. 

The same authors suggests that an advective heat transfer regime in the South Portuguese 

Zone which produced relatively uniform high temperatures in the upper crust, overprinting 

any existing vertical VR gradient. The VR data presented in the two boreholes studied is 

consistent with the data and conclusions of Fernandes et al. (2012). The samples collected 

from the boreholes CST1 and CT1 do not show any VR increase with the depth. The 

calculated palaeotemperatures for the outcrop samples are between 236 and 326 ºC and agree 

well with the VR data presented by Fernandes et al. (2012) for the Baixo Alentejo Flysch 

Group. The highest VR value was measured near the Monchique Alkaline Complex (MAC) 

corresponding to a palaeotemperature of 414 ºC, indicating high temperatures related with the 

emplacement of the MAC. The metamorphic aureole caused by the intrusion of the MAC is 

estimated to be between 0.2 and 1 km wide (Rock, 1978; González-Clavijo &amp;amp; Valadares, 

2003). The thermal impact from small intrusions related to the Monchique Alkaline Complex 

in the Algarve Basin could not be totally neglected, nevertheless in the Baixo Alentejo Flysch 

Group the lithologies jad already attained a temperature following deposition and the VR 

values are not the results of small intrusions. 

The VR results show that the temperatures attained in the South Portuguese Zone and in 

particular the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group were high and significantly above the “resetting” 

temperatures for the apatite fission track system and also for the apatite (U-Th)/He system. 

Therefore, it is possible to use both these thermochronological systems to constrain the recent

thermal history of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group. 

In the Algarve Basin the VR values measured for the Upper Triassic-Hettangian units is 1-1.1 

% (Fernandes et al., 2013; McCormack et al., 2007) and correspond to palaeotemperatures 

between 148 and 158 ºC. This range of temperatures is higher than the “resetting” 

temperature for both the apatite fission track and the apatite (U-Th)/He systems. 

The samples collected at Praia da Luz, near the contact with the basic intrusion at Ponta das 

Ferrarias, show that the thermal effect of intrusion is restricted to a maximum length of ca. 2 

km from the intrusive contact. So, in the case of the Lower Cretaceous lithologies in the 

western part of the Algarve Basin, the maximum burial paleotemperatures attained were not 

enough to reset the apatite fission track system. Only near igneous intrusions did the 

temperatures rise enough to reset to the apatite fission track system. In these situations it 

might be possible to use the apatite fission track system to date the age of the intrusion as 

opposed to the country rock thermal history. However, the thermal modelling presented here 

for the Lower Cretaceous Luz Mudstones intruded by the basic rocks at Ponta das Ferrarias, 

suggests that near the intrusive contact maximum temperatures of 275 ºC were attained but 

reduced to 100 ºC after only 10 000 years.

V–APATITE FISSION TRACK ANALYSES 
 

In this chapter the analytical methodology for apatite fission track analyses are described and 

the results obtained are presented and discussed.  

5.1 SAMPLES  
 

A total of sixty-seven samples were collected for low-temperature thermochronology, 

geochronology and sedimentary provenance studies. The sampling strategy and sample 

descriptions were provided in chapter II. The lithologies sampled were greywackes, quartz-

greywackes, sandstones, quartzites, granites and syenites.  

 

5.2 HEAVY MINERAL SEPARATION AND APATITE CONCENTRATION 
 

The heavy mineral separation was made using standard separation and concentration 

procedures (jaw crushing, Wilfley table, heavy liquids and magnetic separation) at the 

Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia of University of the Algarve (FCT/UAlg), at the 

Departamento de Geologia da Faculdade de Ciências of Lisbon University (DG/FCUL) and at 

the Department of Geology, Trinity College Dublin. The 63-200 µm size fraction was 

selected for the studies since it yielded the highest proportion of heavy minerals. 

5.3 SAMPLE PREPARATION FOR APATITE FISSION TRACK ANALYSES 
 

After the mineral separation and apatite concentration, it is necessary to prepare apatite grain 

mounts before the apatite fission track (FT) analyses were performed. The procedure for 

mounting the apatite for counting is described in Donelick et al. (2005) and Ketchman (2011) 

and are summarized in figure 5.1. The first step is the preparation of mineral mounts with no 

or, at least, minimal surface relief. This is made by the preparation of an epoxy resin (e.g. 

Struers® epofix). Next, a few drops of resin were placed onto a slide and the apatite grains 

were put over the resin. The mixture of resins and apatite grains were then stirred around with 

the help of a wooden toothpick to ensure that they sink onto the glass surface of the slide and 

were also randomly spread out, so that they would form a single layer of grains on the slide. 

The mounts were then placed in a dry oven at a temperature of 30 ºC, for 12 hours to ensure 

that the resin was completely hardened. The mounts are then ready for the grinding stage,

provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)”

which is intended to grind down the surface of the mount, expose the apatite grains and make 

a flat surface. This was achieved by grinding the mounts on a rotating wet sand paper (2400 

micro-mesh grade) during as many steps as necessary until the grains were exposed. Between 

each step, the mount was checked under a microscope in reflected light to see if all the grains 

were exposed. The next step was polishing the mount using an automated polishing machine 

with different diamond slurry compounds (6 µm, 3 µm, 1 µm and 0,25 µm) on cloth mats. 

Once again, between each step the mount was checked under a microscope to verify the 

quality of the polishing and to see if the mount could pass to the next stage of polishing. This 

procedure was continued until the surface of the apatite grain mount was perfectly polished. 

Once the mount surfaces were free of scratches and imperfections, the exposed apatite grains 

in each mount were etched by immersing them in dilute HNO3, to reveal spontaneous fission 

tracks that intersected the polished apatite grain surface. The protocol employed was 5.5 N 

HNO3 for 20 s at 21 ºC. Once removed from the etchant, the mounts were immersed and 

stirred for a few seconds in a beaker with distilled water and then immersed and stirred again 

in a second beaker also with distilled water. Then, the mounts were removed from the 

distilled water and dried with a paper towel. 

When the number of mounts for an individual sample was in large number, a selection was 

sent to a nuclear reactor to be irradiated with 238Cf. After the irradiation the etching 

procedures for the mounts are the same as for a regular mount.  

In order to know the exact microscope coordinates of the analysed grains in each mount, it 

was necessary to fix a set of precise marks in each mount. These reference marks make it 

possible to use the mounts in different stage systems like a LA-ICP-MS, or later reinsert them 

on the FT stage and recall the stored locations from an apatite grain mount file. The reference 

marks were scanning electron microscope target grids that were glued to the mount surface. 

The target grids are 3mm diameter copper discs with an interior grid and a small letter at the 

centre. Three different grid patterns with the letters A, L and Q were used. The grids were 

mounted in order to form a triangle on the edge of the grain mount.

Figure 5.1 Procedures used from the apatite concentration in heavy mineral separation up to FT counting and 
track length measurements.  
5.4 APATITE FISSION TRACK MEASUREMENTS 
 

The apatites were observed under a Carl Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope coupled to an 

Autoscan stage system. An Olympus/SIS CViewIII high-resolution digital colour camera was 

used to capture the images into the Autoscan? Fission Track Studio software. The software 

controls both the stage and the camera, and also has measuring tools that can be used for 

counting the number of tracks and for measuring track lengths, tracks orientations and other 

track dimensions (dpar, dper, c-axis, etc).  

The first step in the determination of the FT ages consisted in the selection of the grains that 

are parallel to the crystallographic c-axis. This was done using a cross-polarised filter under 

transmitted light as grains parallel to the c-axis are brightest under cross-polarised light. After 

the selection of the grains, it was necessary to delimit an area for track counting, which could 

not be smaller than the size of the laser beam (30 µm). With all the grains selected and the 

areas delimited, it was then possible to start counting the spontaneous tracks, the length of

confined tracks, and some kinetic parameters such as Dpar and Dper. The procedures used to 

measure these parameters using the Fission Track Studio package software are described in 

Ketcham (2011). 

5.5 APATITE U AND LA-ICPMS ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUE 
 
Apatite uranium concentrations were measured using a Photon Machines Analyte Excite 193 

nm ArF Excimer laser ablation system coupled to a Thermo Scientific iCAP Qc ICPMS in 

Trinity College Dublin. The analytical protocol employed is described in detail in Chew &amp;amp; 

Donelick (2012), and integrates uranium concentration measurements for apatite fission track 

dating with REE and trace element analyses along with the isotopes required for required for 

U-Th-Pb geochronology.  The time interval for the baseline correction was 15 s and the 

analysis was 45 s.  The laser spot size was set at 30 µm with a repetition rate of 4 Hz and a 

fluence of 3.1 mJ/cm2 to yield spot depths typically 10 µm deep.  A HelEx 2-volume sample 

cell was used with a He carrier gas flow of 800 mL/min.  Ar and N2 as an additional di-atomic 

gas to enhance sensitivity (flow rate of 6 mL / min) were admixed downstream. Typically 28 

isotopes were measured in each apatite sample.   Of these isotopes, 43Ca was used as the 

internal standard to correct for drift in instrument sensitivity and variations in ablation volume 

during sessions. Common trace elements in apatite (e.g. Cl, Mn, Sr and Y) and the REE were 

determined along with the seven isotopes (200Hg, 204,206,207,208Pb, 232Th and 238U) commonly 

required for U-Th-Pb geochronology.  Data reduction for both trace element concentration 

measurements and U-Th-Pb geochronology was undertaken using the freeware Iolite package 

of Paton et al. (2011). The Iolite approach involves processing an entire analytical session 

(typically &gt; 5 h) of data, which is not only more efficient but also greatly improves the 

consistency and reliability of data reduction.  

Trace element concentration measurements were undertaken using the “Trace Elements” data 

reduction scheme in Iolite.  Cl concentration measurements followed the analytical protocol 

of Chew et al. (2014a).  The 35Cl background-corrected signals for each apatite analysis were 

normalized to the internal standard (43Ca) and then sample-standard bracketing was employed 

using apatites of known Cl concentration (Bamble chlorapatite and Durango fluorapatite).   

Uranium concentration in unknown apatites followed the analytical protocol of Donelick et 

al. (2005).  In contrast to the ICPMS absolute calibration approach of Hasebe et al. (2003), 

which employs the 238U fission-decay constant, a fission track registration factor and a 

calibration factor for etching and observation, Donelick et al. (2005) used a modified zeta 



 
CHAPTER V-APATITE FISSION TRACK ANALYSES  “An Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and 
provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)” 

	
   60	
  

calibration approach (cf. Hurford &amp;amp; Green, 1983) for ICPMS apatite U concentration 

measurements.  The method assumes that the apatite 43Ca signal intensity during a given LA-

ICP-MS session acts as a proxy for the volume of apatite ablated, and hence the apatite 
238U/43Ca ratio yields relative U concentration measurements.  In this study an extensive 

primary LA-ICPMS session was undertaken on crystals of Durango apatite that were 

previously counted for fission tracks to yield a primary LA-ICPMS zeta factor.  These same 

crystals of Durango apatite were then analysed in subsequent LA-IPCMS (along with apatite 

unknowns for fission-track dating) to yield a session-specific calibration factor on the primary 

zeta value.  Inter-session drift in both the primary and subsequent LA-ICPMS sessions was 

corrected for by monitoring the 238U/43Ca ratio of NIST612 standard glass. The main 

difficulty in apatite fission-track dating by LA-ICPMS is ensuring that the uranium 

distribution with the portion of sample that generates fission tracks on the polished apatite 

surface is quantified spatially, both horizontally (i.e. along the surface of the grain mount) and 

vertically.  The spontaneous track density in the samples analysed in this study was high 

enough to detect possible U zonation, while depth-related variations in U concentration were 

accounted for here by incorporating a function within the Iolite “Trace elements” data 

reduction scheme that weights appropriately the 238U/43Ca ratio with depth.  As LA–ICPMS is 

a destructive technique high quality 3-D images of all the counted grains were archived for 

potential reinvestigation in the future. 

Apatite U-Th-Pb geochronology was undertaken using a modified version of VizualAge data 

reduction scheme (Petrus &amp;amp; Kamber, 2012) for Iolite.  This data reduction scheme 

(VizualAge_UcomPbine) can correct for variable amounts of common Pb in any U–Pb 

accessory mineral standard as long as the standard is concordant in the U/Pb (and Th/Pb) 

systems after common Pb correction (Chew et al., 2014b).   A ca. 1 cm sized crystal of 

Madagascar apatite (Thomson et al., 2012) which has yielded a weighted average ID-TIMS 

concordia age of 473.5 ± 0.7 Ma (Cochrane et al., 2014) was used as the primary apatite 

reference material in this study. McClure Mountain syenite apatite (207Pb/235U TIMS age of 

523.51 ± 1.47 Ma; Schoene &amp;amp; Bowring, 2007) and Durango apatite (31.44 ± 0.18 Ma, 

McDowell et al., 2005) were employed as secondary standards.  Common Pb correction 

employed weighted mean average 207Pb-corrected ages.  An iterative approach based on 

terrestrial Pb evolution models (Stacey &amp;amp; Kramers, 1975) was used to calculate the initial Pb 

isotopic composition for detrital apatite samples as described in Chew et al. (2011).

5.6 APATITE FISSION TRACK RESULTS 
 

Only twelve samples (LP1, PIAS1, FM1, CST1-4, CT1-13, OL1, AO1, SC1, AR1, CM2, 

QR1, TL1, MMP1, MM1) from a total of sixty-seven collected samples yielded good or 

acceptable quantities of apatite for fission track measurements. This was due to the lack of 

apatites in clastic lithologies and the small apatite grain size in some igneous lithologies. The 

fission track ages from these twelve samples are shown in table 5.1.

provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)”

5.6.1 FT results: Ossa Morena Zone (fig. 5.2) 

 

The LP1 granite yielded a FT age of 148±6.1 Ma. The mean track length is 9.91 µm with a 

standard deviation of 1.87 µm. The high number of confined tracks is due to the Cf irradiation 

that this sample was subjected to. The track lengths are relatively short and their distribution 

indicates that this sample has stayed for a long period of time in the partial annealing zone 

and has a recent cooling history. The average Dpar is 1.38 µm and Dper 0.30 µm.  

The PIAS1 granite yielded a FT age of 108.2±3.4 Ma. The mean track length is 11.59 µm 

with a standard deviation of 1.65 µm. The confined track distribution show an almost bimodal 

pattern that could be related to a complex history with more than one stage within the apatite 

partial annealing zone. The average Dpar is 1.33 µm and Dper 0.28 µm.  

For these two samples there is no clear relationship between the following parameters: FT 

ages and the Cl content, FT ages and Dpar and between Dpar and the Cl content. However, 

despite the samples being situated at a similar elevation and in the same geological unit, these 

two granites may have experienced different thermal stories. Recent tectonism or the 

difference in granite (the content of Cl in apatites from sample LP1 (0.52 wt%) is higher than 

in sample Pias 1 (0.02 wt%) may explain the older FT age) could be a likely explanation for 

the difference in FT ages between the two samples. Despite the difference in FT ages of the 

two samples, they are consistent with the FT ages obtained by Stapel (1999) for the Variscan 

Zone.

5.6.2 FT results from the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group samples 
 

It was possible to determine FT ages from seven samples of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group 

from the South Portuguese Zone. However only one sample (CST1-4) from the Mértola 

Formation yielded enough confined tracks to allow modelling of the data. 

5.6.2.1 Mértola Fm. samples (fig. 5.3) 
 

The FM1 greywacke has two populations of FT ages. These two populations were defined 

based on the Cl content. The first population, with a Cl content lower than 0.35 wt% yielded 

an FT age of 79.4±4.6 Ma with a Dpar of 1.18 µm and a Dper of 0.39 µm. The second 

population with a Cl content higher than 0.35 yielded a FT age of 212.6±13.3 Ma with a Dpar 

of 1.18 µm and a Dper of 0.25 µm. No confined tracks were observed in this sample. The 

oldest FT age is younger than the depositional age, meaning that the FT ages were at least 

partially reset after deposition.  The two populations of FT ages could indicate that the sample 

was not totally annealed – possibly only the low Cl apatites were totally reset.

The CST4-1 greywacke yielded an FT of 90.8±3.8 Ma. The mean track length is 11.04µm 

with a standard deviation of 1.99µm. The average Dpar is 1.31 µm and Dper 0.31 µm. There 

was not any observed relationship between FT ages and Cl content, FT age and Dpar, and Cl 

content and Dpar. The track lengths are relatively short and its broad distribution indicating 

that the sample resided for a long period of time in the partial annealing zone. 

In sample CT1-13 only 4 grains were analysed, yielding an age of 111±9.5 Ma. No confined 

tracks were observed in this sample and no relationship was observed between between FT 

ages and Cl content, FT age and Dpar, and Cl content and Dpar 

The OL1 greywacke yielded an age of 157.9±10.3 Ma. The mean track length is 9.97 µm with 

a standard deviation of 2.61µm. The number of confined tracks is very low and their 

distributions do not allow for any firm interpretations. There was no observed relationship 

between FT ages and Cl content, FT age and Dpar, and Cl content and Dpar. 

The samples from the Mértola Formation were collected in different geographic locations and 

stratigraphic levels (chapter II). The FT ages show that all apatites were reset after deposition. 

The older FT age in sample FM1 (216 Ma) is from apatites with high Cl (&gt;0.35 wt%) content. 

The higher Cl content in these grains means that they could resist to the annealing and 

preserved an older thermal history. The others samples gave Cretaceous ages, meaning that 

after the Triassic the Mértola Formation lithologies were buried again reaching temperatures 

above 120 ºC.

5.6.2.2 Mira Fm. Samples (fig. 5.4) 

The AO1 greywacke yielded an FT age of 100.1±3.7 Ma. The mean track length is 10.52 µm 

with a standard deviation of 2.57 µm. The average Dpar is 1.58 µm and Dper 0.33 µm.  

The SC1 greywacke yielded an FT age of 72.5±4.6 Ma. The mean track length is 12.44 µm 

with a standard deviation of 0.9 µm. The average Dpar is 1.35 µm and Dper 0.29 µm. The 

track length distribution shows a pattern that could be related to a long period residing in the 

partial annealing zone. 

In these two samples there was no observed relationship between FT ages and Cl content, FT 

age and Dpar, and Cl content and Dpar.  Both samples yield Cretaceous FT ages.

5.6.2.3 Brejeira Formation samples (fig. 5.5) 

 

The AR1 greywacke yielded an FT |age of 59.9±5.7 Ma. Only 5 grains show measurable 

confined tracks and therefore no firm interpretations can be drawn from the track length data. 

However, the mean track length is 13.18 µm with a standard deviation of 2.33 µm. The 

average Dpar is 1.16 µm and Dper 0.24 µm. There was no observed relationship between FT 

ages and Cl content, FT age and Dpar, and Cl content and Dpar. The FT age of 59.9 Ma 

indicates a Palaeogene age that was also identified in the Ossa Morena Zone north of Seville 

(Stapel, 1999).

Zone.   
 

5.6.3 FT results from the Algarve Basin samples (fig. 5.6) 

 

Several samples from the Algarve Basin were collected but only the samples from the Silves 

Upper Triassic sandstones yielded enough apatites for FT studies, and from them only three 

samples yielded enough apatite to determine FT ages. 

The CM2 sandstone sample yielded an FT age of 210.8±12.5 Ma. The average Dpar is 

1.30µm and Dper 0.36 µm. The QR1 sandstone yielded an FT age of 225.7±14.9 Ma. The 

average Dpar is 1.30 µm and Dper 0.33 µm. The TL1 sandstone yielded an FT age of 

223.9±7.9 Ma. The mean track length is 10.1 µm with a standard deviation of 1.53 µm. The 

high number of confined tracks is due to the Cf irradiation that this sample was subjected to. 

The track lengths are relatively short and its distribution indicates that the sample may have 

resided for a long period of time in the partial annealing zone and underwent a recent phase of 

exhumation. The average Dpar is 1.30 µm and Dper 0.29 µm.

In these three samples there was no observed relationship between FT ages and Cl content, 

FT age and Dpar, and Cl content and Dpar.  

Fig. 5.6 FT results from the Algarve Basin. 

 

The apatite FT ages for the Upper Triassic samples are all older than the depositional age 

(±200 Ma). These ages mean that the samples did not reset pre-depositional fission tracks. 

However, the length of confined tracks in sample TL1 is relatively short, indicating that the 

sample was buried to temperatures higher than 60 ºC.   Although, a high number of confined 

tracks was measured, due to the complex thermal story of these detrital apatites it was not 

viable to model sample TL1.  

 

5.6.4 FT results Cretaceous Alkaline Monchique complex (fig. 5.7) 

 

The MM1 syenite yielded an FT age of 46.1±4.4 Ma. The mean track length is 12.7 µm with a 

standard deviation of 0.8 µm. The average Dpar is 1.25 µm and Dper 0.28 µm.

The MMP1 syenite yielded an FT age of 69.1±6.1 Ma. The average Dpar is 1.26 µm and Dper 

0.22 µm. In these two samples there was no observed relationship between FT ages and Cl 

content, FT age and Dpar, and Cl content and Dpar. 

The apatites of the Monchique Alkaline Complex (MAC) yielded FT ages that are younger 

than 72 Ma, the emplacement age of the MAC (Rock, 1978; MacIntyre &amp;amp; Berger, 1982; 

Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997; Valadares, 2004; Miranda et al., 2009). The apatite FT age of 

the sample MMP1, at 407 m, is 23 Ma older than the sample MM1 at 228 m. This indicates 

that the uplift occurred immediately post-intrusion or contemporaneous to the intrusion. The 

narrow shape of the distribution of confined tracks lengths reveal a rapid cooling history. In 

chapter VI the forward modelling of sample MM1 will be discussed in detail.

5.7 SUMMARY  
 

Despite the large number of samples collected, only 18% (12) yielded an adequate 

concentration of apatite for FT tracks studies. This was due to several factors: (1) in the 

detrital samples the apatite content is extremely low probably due to the lack of apatite in the 

source rocks. In the Upper Triassic sandstone samples from the Algarve Basin, the apatite 

content change even within the same horizon; (2) In some igneous intrusive rocks collected 

apatites was not observed in thin section or after heavy mineral separation; (3) For some 

granite and syenite samples it is not always possible to undertake apatite fission track 

analyses because the size of the crystals can be very small. 

Concerning the apatite fission tracks results, some remarks should be highlighted: 

- There is a notable similarity between the FT ages in the Ossa Morena Zone and the South 

Portuguese Zone indicating that uplift must have occurred as a block in these two Variscan 

Zones; 

 - The samples from the Ossa Morena zone are at the same elevation but are far apart from 

each other. The different ages could be related to the Cl content of apatites (average Cl 

content of 0.52 wt% in sample LP1 and 0.02 wt% in sample Pias1) or due to different local 

tectonic settings; 

-All the Baixo Alentojo Flysch Group samples have been totally reset after deposition and 

yield FT ages ranging from the Cretaceous (111 to 59.9 Ma) to the Upper Jurassic (Sample 

OL1-157.9 Ma); 

- In the FM1 greywacke sample the Cl content has a strong influence on the FT ages; 

- The FT ages from the Upper Triassic sandstone samples from the Algarve Basin indicate 

that all ages are older than the depositional age, meaning that the samples were not buried to 

temperatures exceeding 100 ºC; 

- The syenite samples from Monchique Alkaline Complex yield different FT ages that could 

be related to different elevations (and different exhumation histories); 

- The Monchique samples have FT ages similar to the country rock FT ages (the Baixo 

Alentejo Flysch Group samples), which could suggest that the Monchique Alkaline Complex 

was intruded into rocks that had an ambient temperature of ca. 90 ºC. If we consider a 

palaeogeothermal gradient of 30 ºC/km, the emplacement depth should be near 3 km.

VI–APATITE (U-Th)/He AGE ANALYSES 
 

In this chapter the analytical methodology for (U-Th)/He apatite dating and the results 

obtained will be presented and discussed.  

6.1 SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES 
 

The (U-Th)/He analyses were performed on single crystals of apatite using the laboratory 

facilities at the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC). Apatite 

crystals without fractures or inclusions and with a euhedral habit were selected. The samples 

from detrital lithologies contained few apatite grains and when present they were usually 

rounded or fractured. Therefore, it was only possible to analyse apatites from a single detrital 

sample (TL1) from Upper Triassic Silves sandstones of the Algarve Basin and from four 

igneous rock samples, two from the Ossa Morena Zone (PIAS1, PL1) and two from the 

Monchique Alkaline Complex (MM1 and MMP1). All these samples were already described 

and in chapters II and IV. 

Apatite grains smaller than ~50 µm were avoided for (U-Th)/He dating, because such grains 

are subject to significant alpha recoil loss and therefore requiring large corrections which 

cause significant errors in the calculated ages (Farley, 2000). The selected grains were then 

individually photographed, measured and packed into 1 mm long high purity Pt-foil tubes. 

The tubes were placed in individual 2 mm holes in a copper sample pan. Helium was 

extracted from the minerals by heating the foil packets to 600 °C during 1-10 min with an 808 

nm diode laser. The extracted gases were purified in an all-metal clean-up line, on a pair of 

liquid N-cooled charcoal traps. 4He concentrations were measured using an electron multiplier 

in a Hiden HAL4 quadrupole mass spectrometer by peak-height comparison to a calibrated 

standard 4He. After the Helium extraction, each grain was unpacked, recovered and the U and 

Th were extracted by hot acid dissolution using HCl and HF, following the procedures of 

SUERC. The digested crystals were spiked with known amounts of tracer-isotopes (230Th-
235U) and the solutions were then analyzed on a Plasmaquad PQ2.5 inductively coupled 

plasma mass spectrometer. Durango apatite was used as the age reference (Young et al., 

1969; McDowell &amp;amp; Keizer, 1977; Farley, 2000). The ages were calculated using a spreadsheet 

developed internally at SUERC.

provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)”

6.2 APATITE (U-Th)/He AGES RESULTS 
 

Five Durango apatite fragments were analysed as reference material giving an average age of 

30.45±0.64 Ma. This age is in agreement with the assumed (U-Th)/He age for the Durango 

apatite of 31.9±0.5 Ma (Young et al., 1969; McDowell &amp;amp; Keizer, 1977; Farley, 2000).  

From the Ossa Morena Zone the LP1 granite sample gave a mean (U-Th)/He age of 60.5±1.2 

Ma and the PIAS1 granite gave a mean (U-Th)/He age of 108±4.85 Ma. The TL1 sandstone 

from the Algarve Basin gave a (U-Th)/He age 142.9±2.5 Ma. In the Alkaline Monchique 

Complex two samples were analysed. The MMP1 and MM1 syenites gave mean (U-Th)/He 

ages of 32.0±1.65 Ma and 38.5±0.8 Ma, respectively. 

 
Table 6.1 (U-Th)/He age results.   

 

5.3 DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY 
 

The apatite (U–Th)/He thermochronometer records the cooling of rocks through the 35–80 °C 

temperature interval and can be used to determine the timing and rate of exhumation of the 

uppermost 1–3 km of the Earth’s crust (Farley, 2000; Farley, 2002; Brady, 2002). However,

apatite (U–Th)/He apparent ages will generally reflect residence for extended periods of time 

at temperatures where helium is neither quantitatively retained nor lost by diffusion (Wolf et 

al., 1998). The analysis of a single age apatite mineral grain is not totally conclusive of a 

thermal history, but incorporating both apatite FT and (U-Th)/He ages into forward 

modelling, a more restricted range of thermal history solutions can be extracted. This 

methodology will be addressed in chapter VIII.  

In the Ossa Morena Zone the LP1 granite sample yields a He age of 60.5±1.2 Ma, and the 

apatite FT age for the same sample is 148±6.1 Ma. This difference in age indicates that the 

sample stayed a long period of time in a temperature near the partial annealing/retention zone 

and it had a recent cooling history, based on the fission track lengths data described in chapter 

V. The PIAS1 granite also from the Ossa Morena Zone, has a (U-Th)/He age of 108±4.85 Ma, 

similar to the apatite FT age (108±3.4 Ma), that can be related with He implantation. 

 

In the Algarve Basin the TL1 sandstone has a mean (U-Th)/He age of 142.9±2.5 Ma and the 

apatite FT age for this sample indicates that it has been reset after the deposition. This 

conclusion does not agree with burial thermal histories curves modelled by Fernandes et al. 

(2013) for the Sagres-Lagos area that indicate that the maximum temperature may have been 

attained during the late Cretaceous. However, the burial thermal history was constrained for 

the Lagos area whereas the number of samples studied was superior to the Sagres area. In 

fact, the stratigraphic and paleontological data (Rocha, 1976) indicate that Sagres area 

constituted a topographic high that separated the west Portuguese margin from the southern 

Portuguese margin in the Jurassic.  Both Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary sequences are 

much thinner in this area than in any other part of the basin (Terrinha, 1998). So, the sample 

TL1 may belong to a block that could constitute a structural high throughout the Mesozoic 

times. With this assumption and considering the maximum palaeogeothermal gradients 

calculated for this area of 52 ºC/km (Fernandes et al., 2013), burial under a 1.5 km thick 

succession would be enough to reset the (U-Th)/He ages.  

In the Monchique Alkaline Complex the MM1 syenite yields a mean (U-Th)/He age of 

38.5±0.8 Ma with is similar to sample MMP1 (mean (U-Th)/He  age of 32.0±1.65 Ma).

VII–U-Pb ZIRCON AND APATITE GEOCHRONOLOGY  
	
  
In this chapter the analytical methodology for U-Pb detrital zircon and apatite dating will be 

presented and discussed.  

7.1 SAMPLE SELECTION AND PREPARATION 
 

Four greywackes samples from the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group  (fig. 2.1) were selected for 

detrital zircon dating. The selected samples were: sample FM1 collected at the base of the 

Mértola Formation, ca. 100 m above the contact with the Volcano-Sedimentary Complex; 

sample AO1 collected at the base of the Mira Formation; and two samples from the Brejeira 

Formation, DZ1 and DZ12, collected from two different stratigraphic levels. Sample DZ1 was 

collected from quartz-wacke beds positioned at the lower part of the Brejeira Formation while 

sample DZ12 was collected from greywacke beds in the upper part of this formation. Zircons 

grains were separated and concentrated as described in chapter V. Zircons were mounted in 

2.5 cm epoxy mounts and polished to approximately half thickness prior to analysis. 

The apatites analysed for U-Pb dating were from the same samples that was selected for 

fission track analyses. The analysed samples were described in chapter II and V, and 

correspond to: samples PIAS1 and LP1 from the Ossa-Morena Zone; samples FM1, CST1-4, 

CT1-13 and OL1 from the Mértola Formation; sample AO1 from Mira Formation; sample 

AR1 from the Brejeira Formation; samples TL1, QR1, SC1 and CM2 from Upper Triassic 

Silves Sandstones from the of the Algarve Basin; and samples MM1 and MMP1 from the 

Monchique Alkaline Complex. The apatites were already mounted for FT analyses and only 

the grains selected for FT measurements were analysed. 

7.2 ZIRCON ICPMS ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUE 
 

Zircon U-Pb data was collected from the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group samples using a 

Photon Machines Analyte Exite 193 nm ArF Excimer laser-ablation system coupled to a 

Thermo Scientific iCAP Qc at the Department of Geology Trinity College Dublin. Nine 

isotopes (88Sr, 91Zr, 200Hg, 204,206,207,208Pb, 232Th and 238U) were acquired for each of the four 

zircon samples using a 30 µm laser spot, a 4 Hz laser repetition rate and a fluence of 3.31 

J/cm2.   The analytical procedure utilized repeated blocks of four zircon standards followed by 

20 unknown samples. The four zircon standard analyses comprised two analyses of the

1995), followed by one analysis each of Plešovice zircon (weighted mean 206Pb/238U TIMS 

age of 337.13 ± 0.37 Ma; Sláma et al., 2008) and Temora 2 zircon (206Pb/238U TIMS age of 

416.8 ± 1.3 Ma; Black et al., 2004).   

The raw isotope data were reduced using the “Vizual Age” data reduction scheme (Petrus &amp;amp; 

Kamber, 2012) of the freeware IOLITE package of Paton et al. (2011). User-defined time 

intervals are established for the baseline correction procedure to calculate session-wide 

baseline-corrected values for each isotope. The time-resolved fractionation response of 

individual standard analyses is then characterised using a user-specified down-hole correction 

model (such as an exponential curve, a linear fit or a smoothed cubic spline).  The data 

reduction scheme then fits this appropriate session-wide “model” U-Th-Pb fractionation curve 

to the time-resolved standard data and the unknowns.  Sample-standard bracketing is applied 

after the correction of down-hole fractionation to account for long-term drift in isotopic or 

elemental ratios by normalizing all ratios to those of the U-Pb reference standards.  During 

the course of analysis, the Plešovice and Temora 2 secondary zircon standards yielded LA-

ICPMS U-Pb ages of 337.7 ± 1.0 Ma and 417.7 ± 1.4 Ma respectively. 

7.3 APATITE ICPMS ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUE 
 

Apatite uranium concentrations were measured using a Photon Machines Analyte Excite 193 

nm ArF Excimer laser ablation system coupled to a Thermo Scientific iCAP Qc ICPMS in 

Trinity College Dublin. The analytical protocol employed is described in detail in Chew &amp;amp; 

Donelick (2012), and integrates uranium concentration measurements for apatite fission track 

dating with REE and trace element analyses along with the isotopes required for required for 

U-Th-Pb geochronology.  The time interval for the baseline correction was 15 s and the 

analysis was 45 s.  The laser spot size was set at 30 µm with a repetition rate of 4Hz and a 

fluence of 3.1 mJ/cm2 to yield spot depths typically 10 µm deep.  A HelEx 2-volume sample 

cell was used with a He carrier gas flow of 800 mL/min.  Ar and N2 as an additional di-atomic 

gas to enhance sensitivity (flow rate of 6 mL / min) were admixed downstream. Typically 28 

isotopes were measured in each apatite sample.   Of these isotopes, 43Ca was used as the 

internal standard to correct for drift in instrument sensitivity and variations in ablation volume 

during sessions. Common trace elements in apatite (e.g. Cl, Mn, Sr and Y) and the REE were 

determined along with the seven isotopes (200Hg, 204,206,207,208Pb, 232Th and 238U) commonly 

required for U-Th-Pb geochronology.  Data reduction for both trace element concentration

measurements and U-Th-Pb geochronology was undertaken using the freeware Iolite package 

of Paton et al. (2011). The Iolite approach involves processing an entire analytical session 

(typically &gt; 5 h) of data, which is not only more efficient but also greatly improves the 

consistency and reliability of data reduction.  

Trace element concentration measurements were undertaken using the “Trace Elements” data 

reduction scheme in Iolite.  Cl concentration measurements followed the analytical protocol 

of Chew et al. (2014a).  The 35Cl background-corrected signals for each apatite analysis were 

normalized to the internal standard (43Ca) and then sample-standard bracketing was employed 

using apatites of known Cl concentration (Bamble chlorapatite and Durango fluorapatite).   

Uranium concentration in unknown apatites followed the analytical protocol of Donelick et 

al. (2005).  In contrast to the ICPMS absolute calibration approach of Hasebe et al. (2003), 

which employs the 238U fission-decay constant, a fission track registration factor and a 

calibration factor for etching and observation, Donelick et al. (2005) used a modified zeta 

calibration approach (cf. Hurford &amp;amp; Green, 1983) for ICPMS apatite U concentration 

measurements.  The method assumes that the apatite 43Ca signal intensity during a given LA-

ICP-MS session acts as a proxy for the volume of apatite ablated, and hence the apatite 
238U/43Ca ratio yields relative U concentration measurements.  In this study an extensive 

primary LA-ICPMS session was undertaken on crystals of Durango apatite that were 

previously counted for fission tracks to yield a primary LA-ICPMS zeta factor.  These same 

crystals of Durango apatite were then analysed in subsequent LA-IPCMS (along with apatite 

unknowns for fission-track dating) to yield a session-specific calibration factor on the primary 

zeta value.  Inter-session drift in both the primary and subsequent LA-ICPMS sessions was 

corrected for by monitoring the 238U/43Ca ratio of NIST612 standard glass. The main 

difficulty in apatite fission-track dating by LA-ICPMS is ensuring that the uranium 

distribution with the portion of sample that generates fission tracks on the polished apatite 

surface is quantified spatially, both horizontally (i.e. along the surface of the grain mount) and 

vertically.  The spontaneous track density in the samples analysed in this study was high 

enough to detect possible U zonation, while depth-related variations in U concentration were 

accounted for here by incorporating a function within the Iolite “Trace elements” data 

reduction scheme that weights appropriately the 238U/43Ca ratio with depth.  As LA–ICPMS is 

a destructive technique high quality 3-D images of all the counted grains were archived for 

potential reinvestigation in the future.

Apatite U-Th-Pb geochronology was undertaken using a modified version of VizualAge data 

reduction scheme (Petrus &amp;amp; Kamber, 2012) for Iolite.  This data reduction scheme 

(VizualAge_UcomPbine) can correct for variable amounts of common Pb in any U–Pb 

accessory mineral standard as long as the standard is concordant in the U/Pb (and Th/Pb) 

systems after common Pb correction (Chew et al., 2014b).   A ca. 1 cm sized crystal of 

Madagascar apatite (Thomson et al., 2012) which has yielded a weighted average ID-TIMS 

concordia age of 473.5 ± 0.7 Ma (Cochrane et al., 2014) was used as the primary apatite 

reference material in this study. McClure Mountain syenite apatite (207Pb/235U TIMS age of 

523.51 ± 1.47 Ma; Schoene &amp;amp; Bowring, 2007) and Durango apatite (31.44 ± 0.18 Ma, 

McDowell et al., 2005) were employed as secondary standards.  Common Pb correction 

employed weighted mean average 207Pb-corrected ages.  An iterative approach based on 

terrestrial Pb evolution models (Stacey &amp;amp; Kramers, 1975) was used to calculate the initial Pb 

isotopic composition for detrital apatite samples as described in Chew et al. (2011). 

7.4 ZIRCON U-PB GEOCHRONOLOGY RESULTS 
 

Results are presented as Concordia diagrams and as probability density plots (fig. 7.1 and 

7.3). Only data that are less than 20% discordant and with an analytical precision (2?) better 

than 10% are shown on figures 7.1 and 7.2. 206Pb/238U ages were used for all ages quoted in 

the text and for all grains on the probability density plots. The U–Pb LA-ICPMS data are 

shown in the annex III. All Concordia diagrams and probability density plots were drawn 

using Isoplot v3.0 (Ludwig, 2003). 

7.4.1 South Portuguese Zone 

7.4.1.1 Mértola Formation (FM1) 
 

A total of 50 zircon grains were analysed in sample FM-1 (the Mértola Formation with a 

depositional age of 345-326Ma). Sample FM1 is dominated by U-Pb zircon ages within the 

326-388 Ma age range (corresponding to 34 grains) and a peak at 336 Ma. A sub-population 

of U-Pb zircon ages occurs within the 440-619 Ma interval (corresponding to 11 grains), with 

two peaks at 498 and at 582 Ma, Five U-Pb zircons analyses were encountered in the interval 

637-2193 Ma (the U-Pb age age of the oldest zircon).

A total of 40 zircon grains were analysed in sample AO1 from the Mira Formation 

(depositional age of 326-315 Ma). A cluster of U-Pb zircon ages occurs within the interval 

316-369 Ma, with a peak at 323 Ma, and comprises more than 50% of the data (21 grains). A 

sub-population occurs within the 400-612 Ma age range, with a peak at 482 Ma, 

corresponding to 12 grains. Lastly, seven zircon grains occur within the interval 1267-2428 

Ma.  

7.4.1.3 Brejeira Formation (DZ1, DZ12) 
 

Samples DZ1 and DZ12 were collected from the Brejeira Formation (depositional age of 315-

307 Ma). A total of 79 grains in sample DZ1 and 65 in sample DZ12 were analysed. The 

youngest grain in sample DZ1 yielded an age of 367 Ma. Two well-defined sub-populations 

are evident in sample DZ1. One occurs within the interval 367-447 Ma, with a peak at 420 

Ma, and is represented by 13 grains. The second population, corresponding to 40 grains, 

shows a large spectrum of ages within the interval 519-675Ma, with a peak at 608 Ma. 

Twenty-six zircons grains yielded ages in the interval 720-2150 Ma. 

The youngest grain in sample DZ12 yielded an age of 350 Ma. Two small sub-populations lie 

within the intervals 350-371 Ma (4 grains) and 415-421 Ma (3 grains), with peaks at 366 and 

415 Ma, respectively. A prominent sub-population between 498-687 Ma (34 grains) exhibits 

two peaks at 623 Ma and 530 Ma respectively.  The remaining 24 zircons yielded ages 

between 720 and 2649 Ma. Only two Archean zircon grains (2649 and 2708 Ma) were 

identified.

Samples CM2 and TL1 were collected from the Upper Triassic “Silves Sanstone” Formation 

from the Algarve Basin (depositional age of 200 Ma). A total of 88 zircon grains in sample 

CM2 and 61 grains in sample TL1 were analysed. The youngest grain in sample CM2 yielded 

an age of 204 Ma. Three well-defined sub-populations are observed in sample CM2. The first 

occurs within the age interval of 204-633 Ma, with peaks at 269 Ma, 435 Ma and 577 Ma, and 

is represented by a total of 54 grains. The second population occurs in the age interval 745-

1064 Ma, with a peak at 918 Ma and is represented by 13 grains.  The last population shows a 

large spectrum of ages within the age interval 1412-2479 Ma, corresponding to 20 grains. The 

oldest grain yielded an age of 3096 Ma. 

The sample TL1 have a small population defined in the age interval of 308-322 Ma 

(corresponding to 34 grains), with a peak at 312 Ma. The sample is dominated by U-Pb zircon 

ages within a 403-760 Ma age range (corresponding to 46 grains), with a peak at 557 Ma. 

Another two sub-population of U-Pb zircon ages occurs within the 925-1221 Ma and 1904-

3110 Ma intervals (corresponding to 5 grains in each interval). The oldest zircon yielded a U-

Pb age of 3110 Ma. 

 
Figure 7.2 In the left column the U–Pb LA-ICP-MS zircon age probability density plots are presented. All ages

7.5 APATITE U-Pb GEOCHRONOLOGY RESULTS 
 
The results of apatite geochronology are presented as weighted average 207Pb-corrected ages 

diagrams (fig. 7.3). The U–Pb LA-ICP-MS data are shown in annex IV. The weighted 

average diagrams were drawn using Isoplot v3.0 (Ludwig, 2003). 

Unlike the mineral zircon, apatite is unstable in acidic groundwaters and weathering profiles, 

having a limited mechanical stability in sedimentary transport systems (Morton &amp;amp; Hallsworth, 

1999). It is, therefore, likely to represent only first cycle detritus, and would yield 

complementary information to detrital zircon provenance studies (Chew et al., 2011). 

7.5.1 Ossa-Morena Zone (PIAS1, LP1) 

 

The apatites from samples PIAS1 and LP1 from the Ossa-Morena Zone were dated. 

In the sample PIAS1, 24 apatite grains were analysed giving a mean 207Pb-corrected age for 

the granite of 334.9±4.3 Ma., whereas the sample LP1 gave a mean 207Pb-corrected age of 

340.5±7.6 Ma from 19 analysed apatite grains.

7.5.2 South Portuguese Zone 
 

7.5.2.1 Mértola Formation (FM1, OL1, CST4-1, CT1-13)  
 

In the Mértola Formation the dated samples yield 207Pb-corrected ages that span between 329-

357 Ma. Nineteen grains of sample FM1 were analysed, giving a mean age of 334±14 Ma. In 

sample OL1 eight grains were measured, giving a mean age of 346±26 Ma. In sample CST4-1 

20 grains were analysed giving a mean age of 329±12 Ma and finally, seven apatites from 

sample CT1-13 were analysed gave a mean age of 357±23 Ma. 

7.5.2.2 Mira Formation (AO1) 
 

Only one sample from the Mira Formation was analysed. In sample AO1, eleven apatite 

grains were analysed and gave a mean 207Pb-corrected age of 330±11 Ma (ranging from 254-

388 Ma). 

7.5.2.3 Brejeira Formation (AR1) 
 

In sample AR1 from Brejeira Formation 12 apatites were analysed, giving a mean 207Pb-

corrected age of 517±94 Ma (ranging from 301-388 Ma). 

7.5.3 Algarve Basin (CM2, SC1, QR1, TL1)  
 

Four samples from the Upper Triassic Silves Sandstones in the Algarve Basin were analysed. 

In the sample CM2, six grains were analysed giving a mean 207Pb-corrected age of 371±82 

Ma.  Eight apatite grains from sample SC1 were analysed giving a mean 207Pb-corrected age 

of 315±18 Ma. In the sample QR1 six grains were analysed yielding a range of 207Pb-

corrected ages from 214 to 518 Ma. In Sample TL1 twenty-six grains were analysed, yielding 
207Pb-corrected ages ranging from 277 to 910 Ma.

7.5.4 Monchique Alkaline Complex (MM1, MMP1) 
 

Two samples from the Monchique Alkaline Complex (MAC) were analysed. Sample MM1 

gave a mean 207Pb-corrected age of 70.9±4.6 Ma from the six analysed apatite grains. In 

sample MMP1 eighteen apatites were analysed giving an age of 89±18 Ma. Both these ages 

are within the accepted age interval for the emplacement of the MAC of 72±2 Ma (Rock, 

1978; MacIntyre &amp;amp; Berger, 1982; Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997; Miranda et al., 2009).

7.6 DISCUSSION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS FROM THE OSSA-
MORENA SAMPLES 
 

In the Ossa Morena Zone magmatic activity related to the Variscan orogenic cycle is 

represented by volcanic and plutonic rocks with ages clustered in the age interval 345-280 Ma 

(e.g. Pinto, 1987; Sánchez-Carretero et al., 1990; Dunning et al., 2002; Salman, 2004). 

However older granitic bodies from the interval 532-505 Ma are also represented (Salman, 

2004).  It is beyond the scope of this work to characterize the granites of the Ossa Morena 

Zone. Nevertheless, it is important to know the age of the granites bodies for 

thermochronological modelling (Chapter VIII-Forward and Inverse Modeling of Low-

temperature thermocronometer data). These new ages also could be useful in future regional

geology studies.    

The Pias-Pedrogão granite was dated in the Pedrogão area by Rb-Sr in micas (Mendes, 1967, 

1968) and by K-Ar in muscovites (Carvalho et al., 1971), yielding ages of 301, 305 and 

308±4 Ma, respectively. The sample PIAS1 was collected near the village of Pias giving an 

apatite 207Pb-corrected mean age of 334.9±4.3 Ma.  This age is 30 Ma older that the previous 

geochronology data (Mendes, 1967,1968; Carvalho et al., 1971). Different closure 

temperatures for the different geochronologic systems employed can explain this difference. 

Another explanation could be that the Pias and Pedrogão are two independent granite bodies 

with different ages. The obtained age of 334.9±4.3 Ma for the Pias granite is within the range 

348-332 Ma defined by Salman (2004) for the Carboniferous plutonic bodies in the Ossa-

Morena Zone. 

The granite of El Pedroso is considered post or synorogenic with respect to Variscan 

deformation (IGME, 1975), but unlike the Pias granite its age is unknown. The apatites from 

sample LP1 gave a 207Pb-corrected mean age of 340.5±7.6 Ma, therefore, the El Pedroso 

granitic body also falls within the age range of the Carboniferous plutonic bodies the Ossa-

Morena Zone defined by Salman (2004). 

 

7.7 SOUTH PORTUGUESE ZONE DISCUSSION AND INTERPRETATION OF 
RESULTS  
 

The South Portuguese Zone is viewed as a key unit within the context of the evolution of the 

Variscan Orogeny in Iberia (Oliveira, 1990). The deposition of the Mértola Formation has 

been interpreted as resulting from the oblique collision between the South Portuguese Zone 

and the SW border of the Ossa-Morena Zone. This compressive tectonic regime began in the 

Late Visean and caused enhanced uplift and subsequent erosion of the Ossa Morena Zone and 

the palaeoseafloor of the South Portuguese Zone by thrust stacking (Oliveira et al., 2006; 

Pereira et al., 2006; Jesus et al., 2007; Rosas et al., 2008). During the Visean an average 

exhumation rate of ca. 2.6 km/Ma for the central areas of the Ossa Morena Zone was 

estimated using 40Ar–39Ar geochronology (Pereira et al., 2012a).  

In the Mértola Formation samples, 68 % of the zircons (sample FM1) and all the apatites 

(samples FM1, OL1, CST4-1 and CT1-13) are encountered within the interval 326-388 Ma 

(fig. 7.1). There are several possible sources in the South Portuguese Zone and Ossa-Morena 

Zone for detritus of this age. These include (1) volcanism in the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) that 



 
CHAPTER VII-U-Pb ZIRCON AND APATITE GEOCHRONOLOGY “An Integrated thermochronology, organic 
maturation and provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)”

is constrained to the Famennian (375 Ma) and Tournaisian (345 Ma) (Rosa et al., 2009; 

Barrie et al., 2002); (2) the Campo Frio Batholith in the South Portuguese Zone which has 

yielded crystallization ages of between 360-349 Ma (De la Rosa et al., 2002; Rosas et al., 

2008); (3) syn-collisional magmatism and metamorphism on the southwest border of the 

Ossa-Morena Zone which is constrained to between 355-320 Ma (Santos et al., 1987; Azor et 

al., 2008, Jesus et al., 2007). Additionally, a volcanic contribution from the Visean Toca da 

Moura and Cabrela volcano-sedimentary complexes of the Ossa-Morena Zone is also possible 

(Pereira et al., 2006). If we consider the rapid exhumation rates inferred for the Ossa Morena 

Zone during the Visean (Pereira et al., 2012a), it is possible that these igneous rocks were 

exhumed and eroded very quickly after their emplacement. The Mértola Formation contains 

abundant clasts of both felsic and mafic volcanic rocks (Oliveira &amp;amp; Wagner Genthis, 1983; 

Jorge et al., 2013) that suggest a provenance from the Pyrite Belt (Schermerhorn, 1971; 

Moreno &amp;amp; Sáez, 1989; Moreno, 1993). 22 % of the U-Pb zircon ages are encountered within 

the interval 410-630 Ma. This is consistent with a source in the Iberian Pyrite Belt and the 

Ossa Morena Zone where Early Palaeozoic detrital zircon is common (Barrie et al., 2002; 

Braid et al., 2011; Pereira et al., 2012; Jorge, 2009). 10% of U-Pb zircon analyses are 

encountered within an interval of 637-2193 Ma. This age population is common in the detrital 

zircons of the Phyllite Quartzite Group rocks (Jorge, 2009). 

The detrital zircon age spectrum of the Mira Formation sample (AO1) and the detrital apatite 

data are very similar to that of the Mértola Formation (fig. 7.1) The detrital zircon population 

in the 316-369 Ma interval exhibits a peak at 323 Ma and corresponds to 53 % of all the ages 

determined. The abundance of U-Pb zircon ages close to the depositional age of this 

formation (323-315 Ma) indicates the increasing importance of an extra-basinal source due to 

the absence of zircons of this age in the South Portuguese Zone. The mean 207Pb-corrected 

age of detrital apatites (330±11 Ma) corroborates this. The probable source(s) for this zircon 

and apatite population is the Variscan intrusives and their associated volcanic rocks on the 

southwest border of the Ossa-Morena Zone (Santos et al., 1987; Azor et al., 2008; Jesus et 

al., 2007). A second sub-population within a 400-612 Ma age range, with a peak at 482 Ma, 

corresponds to 30 % of the U-Pb zircon ages. The source for zircons within this age interval is 

probably the same as that described above for the Mértola Formation (i.e. the Iberian Pyrite 

Belt and the Ossa Morena Zone). 

In summary, the detrital zircon age spectra and the detrital apatite ages of the siliciclastic 



 
CHAPTER VII-U-Pb ZIRCON AND APATITE GEOCHRONOLOGY “An Integrated thermochronology, organic 
maturation and provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)” 

	
   87	
  

sedimentary rocks of the Mértola and Mira formations imply they have a strong extra-basinal 

contribution component (the Ossa-Morena Zone) as well as a minor intra-basinal contribution 

(the South Portuguese Zone). The detrital apatite ages show the contribution of an extra-

basinal component. There is also a close similarity in the petrographic and geochemical 

signatures of the sedimentary rocks of the Mértola and Mira formations as both have source 

area(s) dominated by a granitoid composition with a minor contribution from mafic rocks 

(Jorge et al., 2013).  

The detrital zircon spectra and detrital apatite ages of the Brejeira Formation are different 

from those of the Mértola and Mira formations (fig. 7.1). In the Brejeira Formation zircons 

younger than 350 Ma are absent in contrast with the detrital zircon age spectra of the Mértola 

and Mira formations. Zircons ages within the interval 367-467 Ma correspond to 16 % 

(sample DZ1) and 11 % (DZ12) of all dated grains, with a peak at 420 Ma in sample DZ1 and 

two peaks at 366 and 415 Ma in sample DZ12. Both samples contain abundant detrital zircons 

in the interval 470-800 Ma (53% in the sample DZ1 and 45% in the sample DZ12) with the 

main peaks at 680 Ma and 623 Ma, respectively. The detrital apatites from sample AR1 show 

a mean 207Pb-corrected age of 517±94 Ma that falls in the previous interval (470-800 Ma). 

Ages in the interval 470-800 Ma is generally correlated with tectono-magmatic events that 

affected the Cadomian-Avalonian Belt in Neoproterozoic-Lower Palaeozoic times. Zircons of 

this age are also present in the Phylite Quartzite Group (Jorge, 2009; Braid et al., 2011) and in 

the Tercenas Formation in the South Portuguese Domain (fig. 2.2; Pereira et al., 2012b). 

Zircons within the 900 – 1100 Ma interval are also present in the Brejeira Formation. Zircons 

of this age are common within the Avalonia-Meguma terranes (Nance et al., 1991; Barr et al., 

2003; Collins &amp;amp; Buchan, 2004; Murphy et al., 2004a,b; Fyffe et al., 2009; Murphy et al., 

2010). Notably, detrital zircons in the 900 – 1100 Ma age range are absent in both the Mértola 

and Mira Formations.  

The data suggest that until late Serpukhovian times (315 Ma, top Mira Formation), the Ossa-

Morena Zone and South Portuguese Zone contributed, in different proportions, to a foreland 

basin represented by the Mértola and Mira formations (fig. 7.4, fig 7.5). If we assume that the 

model of prograding flysch sedimentation accompanying tectonic imbrication is correct, it 

would be reasonable to assume that both formations shared the same source region and 

underwent a considerable amount of sedimentary reworking. Our data indicate that this is 

valid for the Mértola and Mira formations but not for the Brejeira Formation. Therefore, we

maturation and provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)”

suggest that a physical barrier had existed since mid Visean times separating the Mira and 

Brejeira formations. We also suggest that this physical barrier could be related to the 

forebulge that was formed in response to the tectonic stacking in the north and the sediment 

load of the Mértola and Mira formations in the adjacent foreland basin (Fig 7.4, 7.5). During 

the deposition of the Mértola Formation, that coincided with the initial phase of foreland 

basin development, the position of the forebulge coincided with the shallow marine facies of 

the Carrapateira Group in the South Portuguese Domain as suggested by Oliveira &amp;amp; Quesada 

(1998). 

From the late Bashkirian onwards tectonic loading and the progressive filling up of the 

foreland basin with a thick sedimentary pile (now represented by the Mértola and Mira 

formations), may have caused uplift of the forebulge separating the foreland basin from the 

backbulge depocentre. The continued development of the tectonic load in the north combined 

with subsidence in the foreland basin may have caused the migration of the forebulge towards 

the depocentre of the foreland basin (e.g. Allen &amp;amp; Allen, 2006). The maximum sea level 

lowstand during Early Bashkirian times (Ross &amp;amp; Murphy, 1988; Haq &amp;amp; Shutter 2008) may 

also have contributed to an efficient separation of the two depocentres and to possible erosion 

and reworking of the sedimentary rocks. In this proposed model for the evolution of the Baixo 

Alentejo Flysch Group, the Brejeira Formation was deposited in the backbulge depozone. The 

detrital zircon data in this study suggest the main source area for the Brejeira Formation was 

the Avalonia-Meguma terrane on the SW border of the foreland basin. The quartzites of the 

lower Brejeira Formation could be related to reworking of the sediments associated with the 

forebulge barrier when sea level started to rise during the mid to Late Bashkirian (Ross &amp;amp; 

Murphy, 1988; Haq &amp;amp; Shutter, 2008; Pereira et al., 2007).

7.8 DISCUSSION AND INTERPRETATION OF THE UPPER TRIASSIC 
SANDSTONES OF THE ALGARVE BASIN 
 

The Upper Triassic is a period of transition associated with the beginning of the break-up of 

the Pangean supercontinent and the development of the Mesozoic basins, in a globally warm 

and dry climate (Ziegler, 1990; Frakes et al., 1992; Dercourt et al., 1993; Boucot &amp;amp; Gray, 

2001). In the Algarve Basin, the siliciclastic sediments of the Upper Triassic, termed the 

"Silves Sandstones" (Rocha, 1976), are comprised of sandstones and conglomerates organized 

into positive sequences, with oblique stratification and lenticular structures (Palain, 1976). 

These sediments were likely deposited in a fluvial sedimentary environment associated with 

numerous alluvial fans in a semi-desert region, above the Variscan basement (Palain, 1976). 

Palaeocurrents indicate a sedimentary provenance mainly from NE to SW and S and is 

assumed that the Variscan basement was the main sedimentary source for the Silves 

Sandstones (Palain, 1976). The sedimentary provenance analysis of the Upper Triassic in the 

Algarve Basin is extremely complex. The deposition in a fluvial sedimentary environment, 

where several alluvial fans may overlap in the alluvial plain at the base of a mountain range 

that was being eroded, makes it difficult to constrain the sedimentary provenance. In this 

scenario, the drainage network started eroding lithologies that were overlapped and 

juxtaposed during the Variscan orogeny and contributed in different proportions to the Upper 

Triassic basins, yielding different detrital zircon and apatite ages that are difficult to correlate 

to a specific area/formation. 

The samples from the Upper Triassic Silves Sandstones in the Algarve Basin were collected 

at the same stratigraphic level above the Carboniferous-Mesozoic angular unconformity 

(chapter II). The detrital zircon spectra from sample CM2 shows a population in the interval 

204-633 Ma, with peaks at 269, 435 and 577 Ma. It is possible to define a Permian population 

(15% of the total, corresponding to 13 grains) (fig. 7.2). In Portugal there are uncertainties  

about the deposition of Permian sediments due to absence of rocks from that age, but it is 

very well constrained in the Viar Basin (fig. 2.4) located in southern Spain (Sierra et al., 2009 

and references therein). Sample TL1 has a small zircon population in the age interval 308-322 

Ma (corresponding to 34 grains), with a peak at 312 Ma and the Permian age are absent. The 

palaeocurrents are distinct from the two sample locations. For the locality where sample CM2 

was located, the main palaeocurrents directions are from the NE, while for sample TL1 they 

are from W and SW (Palain, 1976). Although the palaeocurrents only recorded the very last 

piece of paleoflow, it is possible to assume that a strong contribution from the Permian Viar

maturation and provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)”

Basin for the east part of the Algarve Basin. However, detrital apatites of Permian age were 

found in all samples meaning a possible extension of this episodic fluvial contribution. 

Regarding the apatite detrital ages, the CM2 and SC1 showing mean 207Pb-corrected ages of 

371±82 Ma and 315±18 Ma, respectively. These ages are also present in detrital apatites from 

samples QR1 and TL1. There are several possible sources in the South Portuguese Zone and 

Ossa-Morena Zone for zircons and apatites of this age (308-370 Ma) and they were discussed 

in section 7.7. During the deposition of the Silves Sandstones, the BAFG could have been 

eroded and contributed to the sediments of the Algarve Basin. So, it is possible to assume a 

contribution from the “Variscan mountain chain” with small contributions from local areas 

like the Permian Viar Basin.  

Sample CM2 shows a continuous detrital zircon age spectra from all temporal periods, with 

peaks at 577, 920 and 1666 Ma. Sample TL1 yields a more restricted age interval with peaks 

at 585 and 969 Ma. A BAFG provenance could be inferred for these samples since the most 

probable source for the Upper Triassic sediments were the BAFG and other rock units of the 

SPZ.  

The detrital apatite and zircon U-Pb data show possible multiple sources. A local component 

is possible for the ubiquitous Permian and Carboniferous ages. However, the abundance of 

Precambrian ages could be related to either the South Portuguese and Ossa Morena Zones 

lithologies or the Avalonia-Meguma terranes (Nance et al., 1991; Barr et al., 2003; Collins &amp;amp; 

Buchan, 2004; Murphy et al., 2004a,b; Fyffe et al., 2009; Murphy et al., 2010) and could 

contribute to the Algarve Basin. In conclusion, a combination of sources is envisaged for the 

Triassic sediments. A detailed study of the provenance of the Triassic in Portugal study is 

necessary to understand better the different sedimentary sources. 

7.9 SUMMARY  
 

Regarding the detrital and igneous apatite and zircon U-Pb results, some conclusions can be 

drawn: 

- The two granites samples from the Ossa Morena zone yield an apatite mean 207Pb-corrected 

age of 334.9±4.3 Ma for Pias-Pedrogão Granite and 340.5±7.6 Ma for El Pedroso granitic 

body; 

- The two samples from the Monchique Alkaline complex (MAC) gave an apatite mean 207Pb-

corrected age of 70.9±4.6 (MM1) and 89±18 Ma (MMP1). Both these ages are within the

maturation and provenance study in the South Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)”

accepted interval accepted for the emplacement of the MAC age of 72±2 Ma (Rock, 1978; 

MacIntyre and Berger, 1982; Bernard-Griffiths et al., 1997; Miranda et al., 2009); 

- U-Pb detrital zircon spectra and 207Pb-corrected apatite ages from the Baixo Alentejo Flysch 

Group show significant differences between the Mértola/Mira formations and the Brejeira 

Formation. The main peaks in the detrital zircon spectra of the Mértola and Mira formations 

are at c. 330 Ma in contrast to the Brejeira Formation where the main peaks are at c. 615 Ma. 

The same difference is reflected in the detrital apatite ages where in the Mértola they range 

between 329-357 Ma and in the Mira they range between 254-388 Ma.  This is in contrast to 

the Brejeira Formation (ranging from 301-388 Ma). Moreover, U-Pb detrital zircon ages of 

900–1100 Ma are encountered in the Brejeira Formation but are absent in the Mértola and 

Mira formations. spectra difference between the Mértola/Mira and Brejeira formations is also 

supported by independent geochemical and petrographic studies (Jorge at al. 2013). The U-Pb 

detrital zircon age spectra of the Mértola and Mira formations indicate a provenance from 

both extrabasinal (Ossa-Morena Zone) and intrabasinal (South Portuguese Zone) sources. The 

abundance of detrital zircon in the 500-750 Ma and 900-1100 Ma age range intervals in the 

Brejeira Formation suggests a source region in the Avalon-Meguma terranes with minor 

recycling from the South Portuguese Domain (Tercenas Formation). The different provenance 

areas for the units of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group are attributed to the presence of a 

physical barrier (forebulge) that formed during the development of the foreland basin. This 

barrier was active since mid Visean times and separated the sub-basins where the 

Mértola/Mira and Brejeira Formation sediments accumulated; 

- In the Upper Triassic siliciclastic “Silves Sandstones” is derived from multiple sources. 

Permian ages that are more pronounced in the samples located in the eastern part of the basin 

and could reflect a local contribution of the Viar Basin or similar basins in Spain. A detailed 

study of the provenance of the Upper Triassic in Portugal is necessary to understand better its 

sedimentary sources.

VIII–FORWARD AND INVERSE MODELING OF LOW-TEMPERATURE 
THERMOCHRONOMETER DATA 
 

In this chapter the low-temperature thermochronology modelling will be described and is 

based on the data presented in previous chapters.  

8.1 FORWARD AND INVERSE MODELING PRINCIPLES  
 

Fission tracks in minerals (e.g. apatite, zircon) forms continuously over time at a rate that 

depends solely upon the initial concentration of uranium present in the minerals. Earlier-

formed fission tracks tend to be shorter than later-formed tracks, as they will have had more 

time to anneal, and may have experienced higher temperatures. The distribution of fission-

tracks observed in a mineral represents a sampling off all tracks formed and annealed during 

its residence below the total annealing temperature. In essence, they preserve an integrated 

thermal history, making this thermochronometer a uniquely powerful tool for thermal history 

reconstruction (Ketcham, 2005). A detail report of the fission track behaviour with respect to 

different time-temperature histories was described in Chapter III. 

Whenever possible, the samples with acceptable quality and quantity of data were used to 

model its thermal history using the HeFTy software v.1.7.0 (Ketcham &amp;amp; Donelick, 2000). 

HeFTy is a computer program for forward and inverse modelling of low-temperature 

thermochronometric systems, including apatite fission-track, (U-Th)/He ages, and vitrinite 

reflectance (Ehlers &amp;amp; Farley, 2003). Forward modeling is the process of predicting what 

thermochronometer measurements one would expect for a sample that has undergone a 

particular temperature history (Ketcham, 2011). By superimposing measured data, a 

comparison between the predicted results and measured values is possible. The inverse 

modeling is the process by (1) which a large number of forward models are generated by 

HeFTy, (2) the predicted thermochronometer results are compared to the measured values for 

each forward model, and (3) the good and acceptable forward models are used to provide 

quantitative constraints on time-temperature histories that are permitted by the measured data 

(Ketcham, 2011). 

The input values are the age of the sample, the apatite fission-track measurements, the 

confined track lengths, is some cases the (U-Th)/He ages and finally the vitrinite reflectance 

values. Before starting the inverse modelling it is necessary to draw a forward model, that is a 

prediction of a temperature history based on previously obtained information, such as the

period when peak temperatures were attained, uplift episodes, etc. Furthermore, this 

information could also be used to constrain the paths over determined time-temperature 

intervals. In this study, data has been modelled using the Ketcham et al. (1999) annealing 

model. For each run in an inverse model some constraints were added to improve the quality 

of the modelled thermal paths in comparison with the measured values. For comparing the 

results obtained, the software use two statistics to gauge how well the data and the model 

results match. They are the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (or K-S Test) and Kuiper’s Statistic. 

More details on how the software uses these statistic tests are described in detail in Ketcham 

&amp;amp; Donelick (2000) and Ketcham (2005). Ketcham (2011) consider for each of those statistics 

that a “good” result corresponds to a value of 0.50 or higher, which is the expected value if 

the time-temperature path and kinetic model are in fact the correct ones. An “acceptable” 

result corresponds to a value of 0.05 or higher. These values indicate that the model has not 

failed the null hypothesis test that forms the basis of these statistics. A model is considered 

“good” if two conditions are met. First, the mean of goodness of fitness (GOF) test value 

must be at least 0.5. Second, the minimum GOF value must be greater than 1/(N+1), where N 

is the number of GOF tests that were run. A model is considered “acceptable” if all statistics 

for all populations are above 0.05. The “Age GOF” is the goodness-of-fit between the age 

data and age predicted by the model. The results of thermal histories modelled are show with 

different code colours. Each good path is displayed as a yellow line, and each acceptable path 

is displayed as a green line. A region encompassing all acceptable paths is coloured in green. 

8.2 FORWARD AND INVERSE MODELING RESULTS 

8.2.1 Ossa Morena Zone (PIAS 1, LP1) 

8.2.1.1 Sample PIAS 1 
 
The Pias granite (sample PIAS1) is located within the Ossa Morena Zone. The mean apatite 

U-Pb age of the granite is 334.9±4.3 Ma and it yields a fission track age of 108.2±3.4 Ma. 

The fission tracks lengths yield a mean value of 13.32±1.8 µm. The apatite (U-Th)/He mean 

age is 108±4.85 Ma, which is very similar to the FT age most probably to He implantation in 

the apatite giving and older age that was expected, so it was not used in the modelling. 

 

To design the forward model (the blue line in fig. 8.1) a moderate cooling rate of (5.7 ºC/Ma) 

from the age of granite emplacement at 340 Ma until a temperature of 100 ºC in the Upper 

Triassic at 200 Ma was used. Although the sample would have been expected to cool quickly

from magmatic emplacement temperatures, subsequent Variscan orogenesis (325 °C 

(Fernandes et al., 2012)) likely resulted in high ambient temperatures and a slow cooling rate. 

A temperature of 100ºC was adopted considering a normal geothermal gradient (30 ºC/Ma) 

for the sample at 3 km depth, which is estimated from the distance to the Carboniferous-

Mesozoic unconformity, situated 90 km to south. For the inverse modelling no particular 

constraints were added, only the crystallization age and the actual temperature (dashed red 

line). The green lines represent the good-fit paths and the black line represents the best-fit 

model.  

 

The inverse model results show that the values obtained for the fission track ages of 112 Ma 

(G.O.F.= 0.21) and confined fission track lengths of 13.69±1.44 µm (G.O.F.= 0.2) agree with 

the measured data. The model results show a slow cooling history since intrusion (334.9 Ma) 

until near 240 Ma, from a temperature of 500 ºC to 400 ºC. After the 235 Ma until 200 Ma the 

sample cooled from a temperature of 400 ºC to 100 ºC at a rate of 8.5 ºC/Ma.  From 200 Ma 

until 65 Ma the sample cooled at a rate of 5.2 ºC/Ma until it reached 75 ºC. From 65 Ma until 

the present the sample cooled at a rate of c. 1 ºC/Ma to near surface temperatures.

8.2.1.2 Sample LP1 
 
The El Pedroso (sample LP1) granite was emplaced within the Ossa Morena Zone. The mean 

apatite U-Pb age of the granite is 340.5±7.6 Ma and it yields a fission track age of 148.3±6 

Ma. The fission tracks lengths yield a mean length of 12.51±1.3 µm. The mean apatite (U-

Th)/He age is 60.5±1.2 Ma. 

To design the forward model (blue line in fig. 8.2) a slow to moderate cooling path from 340 

Ma until a temperature near 75 ºC in the Triassic at 200 Ma was considered based on the same 

considerations used for the Pias granite model. In the LP1 sample it was necessary to consider 

a temperature of 75 ºC at 200 Ma instead of 100º C in order to better adjust the model to the 

observed data. After a period at temperatures of 60-70 ºC, a fast cooling event from 15 Ma to 

near surface temperatures was invoked. 

For the inverse modelling no particular constraints were. The green lines represent the good-

fit paths and the black line represents the best-fitting model. The inverse model results show 

that the values obtained for the fission track ages of 141 Ma (G.O.F.=0.22), for the confined 

fission track lengths of 12.92±1.27 µm (G.O.F.=0.11) and for the He ages of 25.4 Ma  

(G.O.F.=0.07) agree with the measured data (table 8.2). 

The model results show a slow cooling history since the intrusion (340.5 Ma) until ca. 250 

Ma, from a temperature of 500 ºC to 370 ºC. After 250 Ma until the 210 Ma the sample cools 

from a temperature of 370 ºC to 80 ºC at a rate of 7 ºC/Ma. The oldest fission track in the 

model simulation has an age of 220 Ma. Since the 210 Ma until 35 Ma the granite cools very 

slowly at a rate of 0.05 ºC/Ma until reaching 70 ºC. From 35 Ma until the present day the 

sample cools ata a rate of c. 3.5 ºC/Ma to near surface temperatures. The model did not fit the 

He age with the measured He age, however it passed in the test with a G.O.F of 0.07.

fission track lengths modeled (black curve).

8.2.2 South Portuguese Zone - Mértola Formation (Sample CST1-4) 
 
Sample CST4 belongs to the Mértola Formation from the South Portuguese Zone, with a 

depositional age of between 344-326 Ma. Apatites from this sample show a fission-track age 

of 90.8±3.8 Ma with a mean confined track length of 11.04±1.99 µm. The vitrinite reflectance 

for the shale in contact with this sample is 4.2±0.4 %Rr, which is equivalent to a maximum 

temperature between 290 and 310 ºC. 

To design the forward model the following conditions were considered: rapid burial followed 

by maximum heating after deposition due to an advective fluid flow system (Fernandes et al., 

2012). With these peak temperatures all the FT ages should be reset. Considering the position 

of the Carboniferous-Mesozoic unconformity that outcrops ca. 20 km south of the location of 

this sample, this sample was near the surface, most probably during the Permian (due to the 

absence of Permian rocks). At 200 Ma (Upper Triassic) a temperature of 100 ºC was adopted 

based on an inferred sample depth of 2.5 km depth (based on the geometry of the 

Carboniferous-Mesozoic unconformity surface) using a typical gradient (30 ºC/km). 

Regarding the inverse modelling, for each run a constraint was added to improve the quality

of the modelled thermal paths in comparison with the observed data. In the first running, no 

constraints were added and no paths were obtained (fig. 8.3).

the model that best fits all AFT data. The right plot shows the fission track lengths measured (vertical bars) and

For the second run (fig. 8.4) a constraint box between 300-325 Ma and 270-325 ºC was added 

to constrain the maximum temperature reached by the sample. Several different paths that can 

explain the thermal history of the sample were obtained.

Table 8.3 Modeled and measured results for sample CST1-4.  

  
 

The values obtained from the inverse model for the fission track ages of 90.8 Ma 

(G.O.F.=0.99) and for the confined track lengths of 13.28±1.51 µm (G.O.F.=0.9) agree with 

the measured data (table 8.3). The model result shows a heating episode relating to burial and 

the last phase of Variscan tectonics. After the maximum temperature was reached at 320 Ma, 

the sample cooled at a rate of 2 ºC/Ma until to 150 ºC at 260 Ma. The sample then resided for 

a long period in the partial retention zone until 20 Ma, which allows for the reduction of the 

fission track lengths and the large dispersion in their distribution (standard deviation of 1.99 

µm). The oldest fission track in the model simulation has an age of 135 Ma. During this 

period the cooling rate was very low at c. 0.4 ºC/Ma. This could be attributed to the 

deposition of Mesozoic sediments. From 20 Ma until the present day, the cooling rate was c. 2 

ºC/Ma.  

8.2.3 Monchique Alkaline Complex (MM1) 
 
The MM1 syenite belongs to the Monchique Alkaline Complex (MAC). The apatite U-Pb  

age of this sample is 70.9±4.6 Ma and it yields a fission track age of 49.6±4.3 Ma. The fission 

tracks lengths yield a mean length of 12.7±0.8 µm. The apatite (U-Th)/He mean age is 

38.5±0.8 Ma. 

Considering the fission track ages from the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group from the South 

Portuguese Zone (ranging from 157 to 59.9 Ma), this demonstrates that the Baixo Alentejo 

Flysch Group formations were already at a temperature below 100 ºC before or during the 

Monchique Alkaline Complex intrusion. This implies that the host rock was “cold” and 

located ca. 2 km depth if a normal palaeogeothermal gradient of 30 ºC/km was considered. 

So, the forward model has been designed to reflect a thermal history of a sample that 

underwent rapid cooling after intrusion, followed by a long period in the partial retention zone 

that may reduce considerably the fission track lengths, and a recent and rapid cooling event

For the inverse model no constraints were added to the model in the first run and no results 

were obtained. In a second run a constraint was added in order to contrain the host rock 

temperature (between 60 and 100 °C) at the time of intrusion (72 Ma) (fig. 8.5).

The results attained from the inverse model provided very interesting data on the thermal 

evolution of the MAC. The values produced by the inverse model for the fission track ages of 

53.9 Ma (G.O.F.=0.31) and for the confined track lengths of 12.99±1 µm (G.O.F.=0.31), are 

similar to those measured (table 8.4). After the intrusion, the sample cooled in a period of 6 

Ma from magmatic temperatures to ca. 100 ºC. This rapid decrease in temperature was due, 

most probably, to the host rock temperature during the intrusion, which had an ambient 

temperature of ca. 100 ºC. At, approximately, 66 Ma the sample was at a temperature of 70 

ºC. The oldest fission track obtained by the model is 68.7 Ma. The sample stayed at near 

constant temperatures the top of the partial retention zone (ca. 60 ºC) from 68.7 Ma to 5 Ma, 

allowing for the observed reduction in the fission track lengths. From 5 Ma to present day 

times, the sample cooled from a temperature of 50 ºC to near-surface temperatures. If we 

consider a normal geothermal gradient of 30 °C/Ma, from 5 Ma to the present day, the MAC 

was exhumed at 0.3 km/Ma.

8.3 SUMMARY 
 
Considering the results attained by the forward and inversion modelling, the samples from the 

Ossa-Morena Zone (Pias1 and CST4-1) exhibit a similar thermal history. Both samples 

exhibits low to moderate cooling rate until 240 Ma and subsequent fast cooling throughout 

the Triassic until 200 Ma to a temperature within the apatite PAZ, which allows for the 

observed reduction in the confined fission track lengths. The last phase of cooling to near 

surface temperatures started in the Pias Granite at 65 Ma. If we assume a paleogeothermal 

gradient of 30 °C/km, an estimated exhumation rate of 30 m/Ma can be considered for the 

Pias granite from 65 Ma to the present day. In the El Pedroso granite sample, the last phase of 

cooling started at 35 Ma. Assuming a paleogeothermal gradient of 30 °C/km an exhumation 

rate of 65 m/Ma from 35 Ma until the present day is inferred. 

The greywacke sample CST1-4 was the only sample modelled from the Baixo Alentejo 

Flysch Group from the South Portuguese Zone. It shows a heating episode after burial that is 

related to the last phase of Variscan tectonics. After the maximum temperature of 300 ºC was 

attained at 320 Ma, the sample cooled to a temperature of 150 ºC at 260 Ma. From 260 Ma 

until 20 Ma, the sample stayed in the apatite PAZ, which allowed for the observed reduction 

in the fission track lengths and the large dispersion in the track length distribution. This could 

be related to possible reburial associated with deposition of the Mesozoic sediments of the 

Algarve Basin. From 20 Ma until the present day, and considering a typical paleogeothermal 

gradient of 30 ºC/Ma, an exhumation rate of ca. 75 m/Ma can be inferred for this sample. 

The syenite sample MM1 from the Monchique Alkaline Complex, cooled very fast from 

initial magmatic temperatures to around 70 ºC. This rapid cooling event was most probably 

associated with thermal relaxation from magmatic temperatures to ambient host rock 

temperatures, of 70 ºC. It is most likely that the intrusion of the MAC was at very shallow 

depths in the crust (ca. 2 km depth). The sample stayed at a constant temperature near to the 

top of the partial annealing zone from 68.7 Ma to 5 Ma, allowing for the observed reduction 

in the fission track lengths. From 5 Ma to the present times, the sample cooled from a 

temperature of 50 ºC to near surface temperatures. If we consider a typical geothermal 

gradient of 30 °C/Ma, the MAC underwent an exhumation of 0.3 km/Ma from 5 Ma to the 

present day.

IX – APATITE REE AS PROVENANCE INDICATOR 
 

9.1 REE IN APATITE 
 
Apatite is a widespread accessory mineral and its abundance is directly related to the 

phosphorus content of the rock and inversely with increasing silica content (Bergstøl, 1972; 

Laznicka, 1993; Frietsch &amp;amp; Perdahl, 1995). The crystallisation of phosphate phases is an 

important process in natural systems as the residence of important trace elements such as U, 

Th, Sr, and REE is at least partly controlled through melt/phosphate mineral equilibrium 

(Toplis &amp;amp; Dingwell, 1996). Apatite may concentrate a high proportion of whole-rock REE, 

Sr, U and Th (Ayers &amp;amp; Watson, 1993; Roeder et al., 1987). As a result, apatite is a potentially 

sensitive recorder of the trace-element chemistry of the rock system at the time of its 

crystallization. (Sha &amp;amp; Chappell, 1999; Belousova, 2000; Belousova et al., 2001). So, the 

compositional REE variations can yield specific information regarding the parent rock type 

allowing the effective recognition of the host rock (fig. 9.1) (Belousova et al., 2002). Within 

individual rock types, the trace-element patterns of apatite are sensitive to the degree of 

fractionation and oxidation state of the host magma, which are important parameters in 

determining mineral potential (Belousova et al., 2002). However, apatites from some rock 

types show a wide range of trace-element composition even within single samples, and 

apatites from granitoids and pegmatites show particularly large standard deviations. This 

reflects the compositional variation found across large crystals from pegmatites, and between 

individual grains within single samples. Both features may be explained by evolution in the 

parental melt composition during fractionation, or by late crystallization of apatite from 

isolated pockets of residual melts that are slightly different in composition and trapped in the 

interstices between early-crystallizing major minerals (Belousova et al., 2002). Another 

discriminating factor is the presence (or absence) of an Eu anomaly. In general, the amplitude 

of Eu anomalies in apatites increases towards more fractionated rocks and probably is 

controlled by the crystallisation of feldspars, which preferentially concentrate Eu2+ from the 

melt (Budzinski &amp;amp; Tischendorf, 1989).

(adapted from Belousova et al., 2002)  
 

One of the advantages of using the laser ablation technique in fission track studies is the 

possibility to measure minor and trace elements along with the REE. Although this was not 

the primary goal of this thesis, an attempt was made to infer the provenance of the apatites 

analysed for fission track analysis based on their REE content. The methodology applied to 

extract the REE data was the same as described in chapter VII. All the results from the 

analyses are normalised relative to a Ca stoichiometric concentration in apatite of 393600 

ppm. The chondrite normalization was undertaken using the values given by McDonough &amp;amp; 

Sun (1995).  

9.2 APATITE REE RESULTS 
 

In the follow sections the results (fig. 9.2 and annex V) were described and grouped similar to 

the previous chapters.

9.2.1 Ossa Morena (PIAS1, LP1) 
 
All apatites from the granite samples PIAS1 and LP1 from Ossa Morena Zone show trace-

element patterns characteristic of felsic rocks with a pronounced Eu anomaly.  In sample LP1 

the apatites are mildly HREE depleted whereas in the sample PIAS1 the REE profile is 

essentially flat (fig. 9.2). In the discriminant plot (fig. 9.3) all the apatites from sample LP1 

fall within the “granitoid” field.  The apatites from sample PIAS1 fall within the “granite 

pegmatite” and “granitoid” fields. Some apatites from sample PIAS1 fall outside the defined 

fields defined by Belousova et al., 2002.

9.2.2.1 Mértola Formation (FM1, CST1-4, OL1, CT1-13)  
 
The apatites from greywacke sample FM1 show a flat to mildly depleted LREE pattern with a 

moderate negative Eu anomaly (fig. 9.2). The HREE are mildly to moderately depleted. On 

the discriminant plot (fig. 9.4), apatite from sample FM1 is associated with mafic lithologies. 

The apatites from greywacke sample CST4 are HREE depleted with a well defined negative 

Eu anomaly (fig. 9.2). On the discriminant plot (fig. 9.4) this sample is associated, with mafic 

and ultramafic lithologies. The apatites from sample CT1-13 show two types of patterns, one 

typical of felsic rocks and the other of mafic rocks (fig. 9.2).  The apatites in sample OL1 also 

show two patterns, but in this case typical of mafic and ultramafic rocks (fig. 9.2). On the 

discriminant plot (fig. 9.4) the majority of apatites fall within the ”mafic” and ”ultramafic” 

fields and in the lower part of the ”granitoid” field (lower Si content). However, there are also 

some apatites from the three samples, that fall within the ”granitoid” and ”granite pegmatite” 

fields.

9.2.2.2 Mira Formation (AO1, SC1) 
 
The apatites from sample AO1 show are HREE depleted with a small negative Eu anomaly 

(fig. 9.2). This pattern is characteristic of mafic lithologies. Only one apatite grain exhibits a 

pattern typical of felsic rocks. Three apatites yield extremely low REE contents. Sample SC1 

is HREE depleted with a small negative Eu anomaly (fig. 9.2). On the discriminant plot (fig. 

9.5) the samples fall in the ”mafic” and ”ultramafic” fields and in lower part of the 

”granitoid” field (lower Si content).

9.2.2.3 Brejeira Formation (AR1) 
 
The apatites from sample AR1 show differing REE patterns typical of felsic, mafic and 

intermediate magmatic lithologies (fig. 9.2). This is clearly observed on the discriminant plot 

(fig. 9.6) where the dispersion of the data is significant. The samples fall in the ”mafic”, 

”ultramafic” and ”granitoid” fields, though, the number of apatite grains analyzed were not 

large enough to draw more definitive interpretations on the apatite provenance.

9.2.3 Algarve Basin (CM1, QR1, TL1) 
 
The apatites from sample CM2 and from sample QR1 show trace-element patterns 

characteristic of mafic and intermediate lithologies (fig. 9.2). Sample TL1 yields apatites with 

a large variation in REE patterns but the dominant patterns are typical of felsic and 

intermediate lithologies (fig. 9.2). The dispersion in the discriminant plot (fig. 9.7) is very 

high and the samples fall in nearly all the fields described.

discriminant plot of different rock types. Fields adapted from Belousova et al., 2002. 

9.2.4 Monchique Alkaline Complex (MM1, MMP1) 
 
The apatites from sample MM1 are strongly HREE depleted with a small negative Eu 

anomaly and the REE pattern is typical of intermediate igneous rocks such as syenites (fig. 

9.2). The apatites in sample MMP1 show the same pattern but with only a very minor Eu 

anomaly (fig. 9.2). Extreme LREE enrichment depletion relative to the HREE is characteristic 

of apatites from mantle derived peridotites and carbonatites (Belousova et. al, 2002), i.e rocks 

with a low Si content like the syanites.  

 

In the discriminant plot (fig. 9.8) the samples fall in the field of granites and one apatite falls 

in the carbonatite field. This high sample dispersion is an example of how simple changes in 

the magma fractionation can affect the apatite REE content.

9.3 SUMMARY 
 
The analyses of apatite rare-elements patterns may be use to infer the chemical composition 

of the source rock of apatites. In the present work only a few trace elements were analyzed in 

addition to the REE and it was not possible to to calculate other discriminant ratios (Sr versus 

Y and Mn, (Ce/Yb)cn  versus the sum of REE, and Y against Eu/Eu*) that can be more useful 

to reveal the nature of the source rocks. Only the Y vs Eu/Eu* discriminatiion plot was 

possible to use. In general, the analyses of the REE patterns and the Eu anomalies are more 

useful than the discriminant plots. The dispersion of values in the granitic rocks is an example 

of how it is dangerous to use only one discriminant plot to ascertain the parent igneous rock 

type. The REE patterns and the discriminant plot show some differences between the Mértola 

and Mira formations and the Brejeira Formation. The mafic contribution is more pronounced 

in the Mértola and Mira formations than in the Brejeira Formation. This difference was 

already detected in geochronologic (chapter VII), geochemistry and petrologic studies (Jorge 

et al., 2013). The samples from Algarve Basin (CM1, QR1, TL1) show a great dispersion of 

possible source rocks types.

X – CONCLUSIONS 
 

The work undertaken in this PhD research was focused on the investigation of the thermal 

history of the South Portuguese Zone and the Algarve Basin. The original study area was 

expanded to include the southern limit of the Ossa Morena Zone. Another field of 

investigation was the sedimentary provenance of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group of South 

Portuguese Zone and the Algarve Basin. Several techniques (vitrinite reflectance, 

thermochronology (apatite fission track and (U-Th)/He) and geochronology (detrital zircon 

and apatite U-Pb) were applied to achieve the objectives proposed in chapter I.  The main 

results of this thesis can be synthetized in the following sections. 

 

10.1 THERMAL HISTORY 
 
The vitrinite reflectance and calculated palaeotemperatures for the outcrop samples in the 

Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group are between 236 and 326 ºC and agree with the vitrinite 

reflectance (VR) data presented by Fernandes et al. (2012). This range of temperatures are 

clearly above the temperature of partial annealing zone (PAZ) of the apatite fission track 

system and also of the He partial retention zone of (HePRZ) of the (U-Th)/He system and 

thus these thermochronological data record the exhumation history of the Baixo Alentejo 

Flysch Group. 

- The samples collected from boreholes CST1 and CT1 in the Mértola Formation from the 

South Portuguese Zone do not show any increase in VR with depth.  The results agree with 

the model proposed by Fernandes et al. (2012) that suggests there was an advective heat 

transfer regime in the South Portuguese Zone which produced relatively uniform high 

temperatures in the upper crust, overprinting any existing vertical VR gradient; 

- The highest VR value in Baixo Alentejo Flysh Group was measured in the Brejeira 

Formation, near the Monchique Alkaline Complex (MAC) corresponding to a 

palaeotemperature of 414 ºC, indicating high temperatures related with the emplacement of 

the MAC. The metamorphic aureole caused by the intrusion of the MAC is estimated to be 

between 0.2 and 1 km wide (Rock, 1978; González-Clavijo &amp;amp; Valadares, 2003). The thermal 

aureoles from small intrusions related to the Monchique Alkaline Complex in the Baixo

Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)” 

	
   113	
  

Alentejo Flysch Group can be neglected because the lithologies already attained elevated 

temperatures during their previous (Variscan) thermal history;  

- The Cl content in apatites have a strong influence on the FT ages obtained; 

 

-All the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group samples were totally reset after deposition and yield 

Cretaceous AFT ages (111 to 59.9 Ma) with one Upper Jurassic age (Sample OL1-157.9 Ma); 

 

- The AFT ages in the Ossa Morena Zone and South Portuguese Zone indicate that 

exhumation must have occurred as a contiguous block in these two Variscan Zones; 

 

- The samples from the Ossa Morena Zone (Pias1 and PL1) exhibit low to moderate cooling 

until 240 Ma, followed by a fast cooling throughout the Triassic until ca. 200 Ma to a 

temperature within the apatite partial annealing zone. The last phase of cooling to near surface 

temperatures started in the Pias granite at 65 Ma. If we assume a paleogeothermal gradient of 

30 °C/km, an estimated exhumation rate of 30 m/Ma can be considered for the Pias granite 

from 65 Ma to the present day. In the El Pedroso granite sample, the last phase of cooling 

started at 35 Ma. Since then until the present an exhumation rate of 65 m/Ma was inferred; 

 

- The greywacke sample CST1-4 from the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group from the South 

Portuguese Zone shows a heating episode after burial related to the last phase of Variscan 

tectonism. After the maximum temperature of 300 ºC was attained at 320 Ma, the sample 

cooled to a temperature of 150 ºC at 260 Ma. From 260 Ma until 20 Ma, the sample stayed in 

the apatite partial annealing zone (PAZ). This long period within this narrow temperature 

window could be related to a possible reburial associated with deposition of the Mesozoic 

sediments of the Algarve Basin. From 20 Ma until the present day an exhumation rate of 75 

m/Ma can be inferred for this sample; 

 

- In the Algarve Basin the VR values measured for the Upper Triassic-Hettangian units is 1-

1.1 % (Fernandes et al., 2013; McCormack et al., 2007) and correspond to 

palaeotemperatures between 148 and 158 ºC. This range of temperatures means that the 

apatite fission track and the apatite (U-Th)/He systems record the exhumation history of the 

Algarve Basin; 



CHAPTER X-CONCLUSIONS “An Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance study in the South 
Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)” 

	
   114	
  

- In the case of the Lower Cretaceous lithologies (VR=0.6%) in the western part of the 

Algarve Basin, the maximum burial paleotemperatures attained were not enough to reset the 

apatite fission track system; 

- The samples collected at Praia da Luz, near the contact with the basic intrusion at Ponta das 

Ferrarias, show that the thermal effect of this intrusion is restricted to a maximum distance of 

ca. 2 km from the intrusive contact. In these situations it might be possible to use the apatite 

fission track system within the intrusion aureole to date the age of the intrusion. The thermal 

modelling for the Lower Cretaceous Luz Mudstones intruded by the basic rocks at Ponta das 

Ferrarias, suggests that near the contact maximum temperatures of 275 ºC were attained and 

which cooled to 100 ºC after only 10 000 years;  

- The AFT ages from the Upper Triassic sandstone samples from the Algarve Basin indicate 

that all ages are older than the depositional age, meaning that the samples did not pass 

through the apatite partial annealing zone. So, the thermal anomaly created by the MAC 

intrusion did not affect the Algarve Basin lithologies. However, the thermal effect from small 

intrusions related to the Monchique Alkaline Complex in the Algarve Basin could not be 

totally neglected; 

- The syenite sample MM1 from the Monchique Alkaline Complex, cooled very fast from 

initial magmatic temperatures to around 70 ºC. This rapid cooling event was most probably 

associated with thermal relaxation from magmatic temperatures to ambient host rock 

temperatures (70 ºC). It is most likely that the intrusion of the MAC was at very shallow 

depths in the crust (ca. 2 km depth). The sample stayed at a constant temperature close to the 

top of the partial annealing zone from 69 Ma to 5 Ma. From 5 Ma to the present times, the 

sample cooled from a temperature of 50 ºC to near surface temperatures. If we consider a 

typical geothermal gradient, the MAC underwent an exhumation rate of 0.3 km/Ma from 5 

Ma to the present day.  

10.2 GEOCHRONOLOGY AND MINERAL PROVENANCE 
 

Regarding the detrital/igneous apatite and zircon U-Pb results and also the REE apatite 

contents, some conclusions can be drawn: 

 



CHAPTER X-CONCLUSIONS “An Integrated thermochronology, organic maturation and provenance study in the South 
Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)” 

	
   115	
  

- The two granites samples from the Ossa Morena Zone (Pias and El Pedroso) yielded an 

apatite mean 207Pb-corrected age of 334.9±4.3 Ma for Pias-Pedrogão Granite and 340.5±7.6 

Ma for El Pedroso granitic body. The calculated age of the Pias-Pedrogão granite is 30 Ma 

older that the previous geochronologic data (Rb-Sr in micas (Mendes, 1967; Mendes, 1968) 

and K-Ar in muscovites (Carvalho et al., 1971). Different closure temperatures for the 

different geochronologic systems employed can explain this difference. Both granites 

analysed (Pias and El Pedroso) fall within the age range of the Carboniferous plutonic bodies 

in the Ossa-Morena Zone defined by Salman (2004); 

 

- U-Pb detrital zircon spectra and also the 207Pb-corrected apatite ages from the Baixo 

Alentejo Flysch Group show significant differences between the Mértola/Mira formations and 

the Brejeira Formation. This difference was also detected in the apatite REE analyses (chapter 

VIII) and in the geochemistry and petrologic studies (Jorge et al., 2013); 

 

-The U-Pb detrital zircon age spectra of the Mértola and Mira formations indicate a 

provenance from both extrabasinal (Ossa-Morena Zone) and intrabasinal (South Portuguese 

Zone) sources. The abundance of detrital zircon in the 500-750 Ma and 900-1100 Ma age 

intervals in the Brejeira Formation suggests a source region in the Avalon-Meguma terranes 

with minor recycling from the South Portuguese Domain (Tercenas Formation); 

 

- The different provenance areas for the units of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group are 

attributed to the presence of a physical barrier (forebulge) that formed during the development 

of the foreland basin. This barrier was active since mid Visean times and separated the sub-

basins where the Mértola/Mira and Brejeira Formation sediments accumulated; 

 

- The sandstones from the Upper Triassic were derived from multiple sources. Permian ages 

are more pronounced in the samples located in the eastern part of the basin and could reflect a 

local contribution from the Permian Spanish basins. 

10.3 IMPLICATION IN ECONOMICAL GEOLOGY 
 

The thermal history information derived in this study may have an impact on the economical 

potential for conventional gas exploration in South Portuguese zone. The vitrinite reflectance 

values in the South Portuguese Zone corresponds to a maximum temperature between 236

Portuguese Zone and Algarve Basin (South Portugal)” 

	
   116	
  

and 326 ºC. These post-deposition temperatures were achieved not only from the burial, but 

also from tectonic deformation. Deformation was followed by a cooling phase related to a 

phase of exhumation until 200 Ma which is consistent with the presence of a Carboniferous-

Triassic unconformity in the geological record. Oil and gas generated after the deposition may 

have been lost during this phase. From 200 Ma until the 20 Ma the temperature remains 

constant between 100 and 60 ºC within the apatite partial annealing zone (and the oil 

window), however the rocks shows at these stage were already overmature. The pronounced 

exhumation since the Late Cretaceous may have destroyed any petroleum system. 

Nevertheless the history in the offshore basins could be different and more detailed studies on 

offshore are required.  

The sedimentary input to the offshore basins since the Late Cretaceous, as result of the uplift 

and subsequent exhumation, must have created reservoirs for the Algarve Basin petroleum 

system and more studies will be necessary to ascertain this. 

10.4 SUGESTIONS FOR FUTURE WORKS 
 

Although many samples were collected during this project, it was not possible to obtain 

fission track data from all of these samples due to the problems reported in chapter V. A 

complementary study in Southwest Portugal Domain and in the Brejeira Formation will be 

necessary to explain if the SW Portuguese region has a different thermal history compared to 

the rest of South Portugal as suggested by Fernandes et al. (2012). 

The thermal history of the Algarve Basin is well constrained onshore but not in the offshore. 

Maturation and low-temperature thermochronology studies should be undertaken on the new 

oil exploration boreholes that will be drilled in this basin in the near future and the results 

compared with the onshore thermal history.    

It is also important that a detailed study be carried out on the provenance of the Upper 

Triassic sandstones in Portugal to understand better its sedimentary sources as this too

The Algarve Basin, southern Portugal is under-explored in terms of petroleum geology. Organic matu-
ration levels and the thermal history of this basin have been ascertained, together with their implications
for future exploration. Maturity was determined using vitrinite reflectance and spore fluorescence/
colour. The succession was extensively sampled (158 onshore samples and 20 samples from two offshore
wells). Thermal history was modelled using 1D PetroMod?.

A palynostratigraphic study of two offshore wells was also completed, showing thick marlelimestone
sequences of Middle and Upper Jurassic age. Hiatuses were identified in the offshore wells within the
Jurassic section and between the Jurassic and the Miocene sections.

The Mesozoic rocks of the Algarve Basin lie within the oil window. Vitrinite reflectance ranges from
0.52e0.7%Rr in the Lower Cretaceous to 1e1.1%Rr in the Upper TriassiceHettangian. Miocene rocks that
unconformably overlie the Mesozoic strata are immature (0.42e0.47%Rr). Maturation levels increase with
increasing age of the strata, indicating that burial was the main process controlling maturation. Thick
marlelimestone sequences of the Middle Jurassic (Callovian) and the Upper Jurassic (Oxfordian) are the
main source rock intervals. The Miocene successions of both offshore wells contains reworked vitrinite
and palynomorphs with maturation levels similar to the Mesozoic rocks of the basin, suggesting expo-
sure and erosion of these rocks during Miocene times.

Palaeogeothermal gradients in the onshore Algarve Basin range from 52 ?C/km to 24.7 ?C/km with pre-
Miocene exhumation estimated at 2000e2500 m. The probable age for the removed cover is Upper
Cretaceous to Lower Palaeocene(?) and peak temperatures in the Mesozoic rocks were attained during
latest CretaceouseEarly Palaeocene times. Modelled palaeotemperatures suggest that the Jurassic
entered the oil-window at the beginning of the Cretaceous with peak oil generation in late Cretaceous
time.

1. Introduction

The Algarve Basin is a Mesozoic to Cenozoic sedimentary basin
located in southern Portugal, cropping out along the entire south
coast from Cape Saint Vincent in the west to the Guadiana river on
the PortugueseeSpanish border in the east (Fig. 1). The basin ex-
tends offshore, where it has been recognized in seismic lines and 5
hydrocarbon exploration wells (Fig. 1). The Mesozoic geology of the

Algarve Basin is, therefore, better known onshore than offshore and
comprises sedimentary rocks ranging in age from Upper Triassic to
Lower Cretaceous, constituting a succession over 3 km thick in the
depocentre of the basin in the central Algarve.

The development of the Algarve Basin is related to consecutive
phases of rifting associated with the break-up of Pangaea. Its origin,
location, sedimentary record and evolution during the Mesozoic are
closely related to a series of basins that developed during the
opening of the North and Central Atlantic Ocean, including, for
example, the Lusitanian Basin in central Portugal, the Porcupine
Basin in offshore western Ireland and the Scotian, Whale and Jeanne
d’Arc basins in offshore eastern Canada (Wilson et al., 1989).
Although the main geological features of the Algarve Basin have been
summarised in several publications (e.g. Manuppella et al., 1988;
Terrinha et al., 2013), none of these discuss organic maturation

levels and thermal history, and their implications for the hydrocar-
bon exploration. Aspects of the petroleum geology are included in
unpublished reports produced by oil companies that were active in
exploration of the offshore basin between the late 1960s and early
1980s (Chevron,1975; Challenger,1976) and in an unpublished Ph.D.
thesis (Matias, 2007). However, these summaries contain few data
regarding the organic maturation levels of the Algarve Basin and
mainly deal with the stratigraphy, micropalaeontology and model-
ling of exploration wells drilled in the offshore. The few maturation
data in these reports are mostly limited to spore colour de-
terminations. In this work, we present vitrinite reflectance (VR) re-
sults from 178 rock samples and use these data to estimate their
thermal maturity, model the thermal history of the Algarve Basin,
and discuss implications for hydrocarbon exploration, especially in
the offshore part of the basin.

Thermal history analysis is an indispensable part of any study of
sedimentary basins and their hydrocarbon source potential. There
are several methods, both optical and geochemical, which can be
used to ascertain the temperatures attained by strata during sub-
sidence and interpret their thermal history. VR is an optical method
considered a reliable indicator of the organic maturation levels of
sedimentary rocks (Hunt, 1996; Robert, 1988; Tissot and Welte,
1978; Bordenave et al. 1993). Since organic maturation levels are
largely related to temperature, VR is also a good indicator of peak
(palaeo)temperatures, which accounts for its widespread use in
basin analysis and hydrocarbon exploration.

Good age control of the sedimentary successions is also funda-
mental in basin analysis studies related to hydrocarbon exploration
and exploitation. This is even more significant in areas where the
subsurface geology is mainly recognized by seismic lines (Esso,
1982a,b; Challenger, 1976; Chevron, 1975) and only by five explo-
ration wells, as is the offshore part of the Algarve Basin (Fig. 1).
Micropalaeontology and palynology are the staple palaeontological
techniques used to determine the age and biostratigraphy in wells
and boreholes. In this study, in order to calibrate the ages of
offshore geological units of the Algarve Basin and allow correlation
with the onshore geology, two wells, Ruivo and Corvina (Fig. 1),
were studied for palynology.

2. Geological background of the Algarve Basin

2.1. Onshore geology

Sedimentation in the Algarve Basin was initiated in Late Triassic
times with the deposition of continental red beds and evaporites,
which unconformably overlie folded and faulted Carboniferous
strata (Palain, 1976) (Fig. 2). The red bed succession (Silves Sand-
stones) consists of sandstones and conglomerates at the base,
overlain by variegated mudstones interbedded with siltstones and
dolomites (Silves Mudstones e Siltstones and Dolomites). The
sandstones were deposited in alluvial environments and the mud-
stones in alluvial to shallow lacustrine environments. At the top of
this sequence, to the south of the EeW trending Algibre Fault
(Fig. 1), there are thick evaporitic deposits, whereas north of this
major structure, the evaporites are virtually absent. The evaporites
mark the first marine incursions into the basin and yield Early

et al., 2000).

Jurassic (Hettangian) palynomorphs in the Loulé Diapir (Fechner,
1989). These strata are overlain by volcanic rocks associated with
the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) (Martins et al.,
2008; Verati et al., 2007) and mark the end of the first phase of
rifting in the Algarve Basin.

After this important magmatic episode, Sinemurian to Tithonian
marine carbonate sedimentation became well-established across
the Algarve Basin. Within this interval, the vertical movements of
northesouth trending faults caused lateral sedimentary facies
changes in the limestone across the basin (Manuppella, 1988;
Manuppella et al., 1988). These facies changes, together with dif-
ferences in thicknesses, allow the division of the Algarve Basin into
small sub-basins, namely, the Western, the BudenseLagoa, and the
Eastern sub-basins (Fig. 1) (Manuppella et al., 1988).

Three main sedimentary cycles, separated by regional un-
conformities or hiatuses, are recognized in the Jurassic (Sinemurian
to Tithonian) marine carbonates of the Algarve Basin (Fig. 2). These
cycles are related either to global sea level variations or to regional
tectonic events (Mouterde et al., 1971; Manuppella et al., 1988;
Terrinha et al., 2002). The first cycle extends from Sinemurian to
lower Toarcian (Fig. 2), and consists mainly of dolomitised lime-
stones that occupy a large area north of the Algibre Fault in
the central Algarve. In the Western Sub-Basin, less dolomitised
limestones (Cape S. Vincent and Praia do Belixe Dolomites) have
yielded Pliensbachian to Lower Toarcian ammonites (Rocha, 1976;
Dommergues et al., 2011). Late Sinemurian foraminifera identified
in the lower beds of the Picavessa Dolomites confirm the age of this
cycle in the Eastern Sub-Basin (Azerêdo et al., 2003).

The second cycle corresponds to the Middle Jurassic (Fig. 2) and
is well-exposed at Mareta Beach in the Western Sub-Basin. At this
location it is represented by a ca. 140 m thick succession at the base
of which are coral bioherms with karstified tops that are filled and
covered by upper Bajocian limestones with Zoophycus and by mid
Bathonian marls (Praia da Mareta Marls). The coral bioherms are
not dated directly and their age therefore remains problematic.
However, the lack of bioherms in the Sinemurian to lower Toarcian
succession in the Western Sub-Basin, together with the absence of
mid to upper Toarcian strata in the same region, suggested to Rocha
(1976) that the most probable age for the Praia da Mareta Bioherms
was Aalenian to early Bajocian, and that the karstification episode
was pre-late Bajocian. Overlying the mid Bathonian marls are more
grey marls that grade upwards into marly limestones that have
been affected by several slump events (Gibling and Stuart, 1988;
Rocha, 1976). Ammonite faunas and dinoflagellates indicate a Cal-
lovian age for this part of the succession (Borges et al., 2011, 2012;
Rocha, 1976). In the Eastern Sub-Basin, this cycle is represented by



P. Fernandes et al. / Marine and Petroleum Geology 46 (2013) 210e233 213
Bajocian to lower Callovian marls and marly limestones that crop
out in the cores of regional anticlines north of Faro (Guilhim) and
Tavira (Borges et al., 2012; Marques and Rocha, 1988a, 1988b). The
establishment of lower Callovian marlemarly limestone succes-
sions across the Algarve Basin suggests that uniform sedimentary
conditions prevailed in Callovian time, possibly due to an increase
in the rate of subsidence and an associated transgressive episode.

The beds at the base of the third sedimentary cycle rest un-
conformably on gently-folded Callovian marly limestones and
marls (e.g. at Cilheta Beach in the Western Sub-Basin). This un-
conformity marks an important tectonic event that is observed
throughout Iberia (Mouterde et al., 1971). Immediately above the
unconformity are limestones in the Western Sub-Basin (Praia do
Tonel Limestones) and limestoneemarl successions in the Eastern
Sub-Basin (Peral Limestones and Marls) (Fig. 2). Both lithological
units yielded ammonites of mid Oxfordian age. These beds are
overlain by a thick succession (over 500 m in the Eastern Sub-Basin)
of Upper Jurassic (mid Oxfordian to Tithonian) interbedded lime-
stones, marls, bioherms and dolomites (e.g. Manuppella et al.,1987;
Oliveira, 1992). Sedimentary conditions became uniform in both
sub-basins in the Tithonian with the deposition of shallow water
limestones (Fontaínhas Limestones with Anchispirocyclina lusitan-
ica) (Fig. 2).

The Lower Cretaceous sedimentary interval is represented by a
mixed carbonate and siliciclastic succession (Rey, 1983, 2006,
2009), which attains its maximum thickness (ca. 1500 m) in cen-
tral Algarve in the Eastern Sub-Basin. At its base are Berriasian
marls and dolomites that rest conformably on Tithonian limestones
(e.g. at Ponta da Almádena in the Western Sub-Basin) (Fig. 2). In the
eastern Sub-Basin this contact is not observed. The Berriasian strata
are followed by Valanginian to Barremian marls, dolomites, sand-
stones and mudstones that were deposited in nearshore and con-
tinental settings. This part of the Lower Cretaceous succession is
better represented in the Eastern Sub-Basin. During the Aptian to
Figure 3. Lithological logs of the offshore wells Ruivo and Corvina with sample position and
window sensu Peters and Cassa (1994).
Albian interval, depositional conditions became more uniform
across the basin, resulting in the accumulation of variegated muds
of possible lagoonal origin (the Aptian Luz Marls) followed by
transgressive limestones and marls (the lower Albian Porto de Mós
Limestones and Marls). Upper Albian to Cenomanian strata are only
known in the Eastern Sub-Basin and are represented by shallow
water limestones interbedded with marls and dolomites.

During the Late CretaceousePalaeocene(?), a major uplift
episode occurred, related to Alpine tectonism and the emplacement
of the Late Cretaceous (Campanian, ca. 72 Ma) Monchique Syenite
(Fig. 1) (Terrinha et al., 2002; Miranda et al., 2009). Although the
main batholith of the Monchique Syenite only intrudes greywackes
and shales of Pennsylvanian age, minor intrusions of the Monchique
Syenite Massif Dyke Swarm intrude the Algarve Basin Mesozoic
succession, especially in the Western Sub-Basin (Martins, 1999;
Martins and Munhá, 1993). As a consequence, no Upper Creta-
ceous to Palaeogene strata are found in the onshore, exhumed
Algarve Basin. After this event, sedimentation only resumed during
the Miocene (Pais et al., 2000), with bioclastic limestones that grade
upwards into silts and fine sands, which unconformably overlie the
Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous strata.

2.2. Offshore exploration wells

2.2.1. Ruivo
This well reached a depth of ca. 2134 m below sea-bed (Fig. 3).

The upper 876 m consists of limestones, sandstones and argilla-
ceous siltstones assigned to the MioceneeOligocene interval
(Chevron, 1975). From 876 to 1087 m depth, sandstones and mud-
stones lacking any stratigraphically-useful fossils were intersected
and tentatively attributed to the Upper Cretaceous (Turonian)
(Chevron,1975). The interval between the 1087 and 1909 m consists
of interbedded marls and limestones with microfossils suggesting a
Middle Jurassic (Callovian) age. The deepest 225 m of the well, from
VR values with respective standard deviations (horizontal bars). Shaded area is the oil

1909 to 2134 m, consists of evaporites (halite and gypsum) with
intercalated minor mudstones beds. By lithostratigraphic correla-
tionwith the succession in the onshore Algarve Basin, this interval is
attributed to the Lower Jurassic (Hettangian).

2.2.2. Corvina
The Corvina well reached a depth of ca. 2900 m (Fig. 3). The top

1100 m consists of limestones, siltstones and mudstones assigned to
the MioceneeOligocene. The interval between 1100 and ca. 2700 m
comprises a thick succession of limestones, marls and dolomites
attributed to the Lower Cretaceous and Upper Jurassic on the basis of
calcareous nanofossils and foraminifera (Challenger, 1976). Our
palynological data from this well interval partially contradict this age
determination (see Palynological results). The interval from 2700 m
to T.D. consists mainly of limestones lacking any stratigraphically-
useful fossils.

2.3. Stratigraphic correlation across the Algarve Basin

From the Lower Jurassic to the Lower Cretaceous, one of the
main features of the onshore Algarve Basin was its division into
small sub-basins by synsedimentary faults (Manuppella, 1988;
Manuppella et al., 1988). One of the main consequences of this
partitioning was differing subsidence rates in the sub-basins. The
lateral correlation of the Mesozoic Series across the onshore
Algarve Basin and its tentative correlation with the two offshore
wells studied (Ruivo and Corvina) are summarised in Figure 4. The

key measured section for the Western Sub-Basin in the Sagrese
Lagos area attains a maximum thickness of ca. 1200 m, whereas a
maximum thickness of ca. 3500 m was measured in the Faro area in
the Eastern Sub-Basin. The greater thickness in the latter is mainly
due to its thick Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous succession,
which is more attenuated in the other two areas that characterize
the Eastern Sub-Basin (Albufeira and Tavira), and in the Western
Sub-Basin, where subsidence rates were more constant throughout
the Mesozoic.

The stratigraphy of offshore Algarve Basin revealed by the wells
Ruivo and Corvina shows more hiatuses when compared with the
onshore part of the Algarve Basin (Fig. 4), precluding age and lith-
ological correlation of the stratigraphic units between the two parts
of the basin. However, it is clear from analysis of the two wells that
major unconformities are present in the offshore which are not
observed in the onshore succession of the basin. In well Ruivo, the
bulk of the Jurassic succession is of Callovian age (see Palynological
results section). The basal beds were intruded in places by Hettan-
gian evaporites (possibly a major diapir structure), and the upper
part is unconformably overlain by Upper Cretaceous sandstones. In
the offshore well Corvina, a very thick Upper Jurassic (Oxfordian)
succession of over 1000 m was penetrated (see Palynological results
section), which is unconformably overlain by, an equally thick (ca.
1000 m) succession consisting of limestones, sandstones and
mudstones of Miocene age. Exceptionally thick Upper Jurassic and
Miocene successions such as those observed in the well Corvina, are
unknown either in the onshore part of the basin or in the well Ruivo.

3. Materials and methods

VR was determined from 178 samples in order to determine the
regional maturity and to elucidate the thermal evolution of the
Algarve Basin (Tables 1 and 2). The samples analysed in this study
were obtained from various sources: outcrops, two groundwater
exploration boreholes (NR and JK), the Loulé Salt Mine, and two
offshore hydrocarbon exploration wells (Ruivo and Corvina) (Figs. 1
and 3). Figures 5a, 6a, 7a and 8a show the geographical distribution
of the outcrop samples analysed. The lithologies used were grey to
dark grey marls, non-calcareous mudstones, siltstones and clay-
rich evaporites. Two thin coal lenses in the late Jurassic Peral
Limestones and Marls at Cerro da Rocha (Table 1, sample 112) and in
the early Cretaceous Mudstones and Sandstones (Weald Facies)
near Tunes (Table 1, sample 59) were also sampled.

Not all stratigraphic intervals in the Algarve Basin contain li-
thologies that are suitable for maturation studies. The Upper
Triassic to Lower Jurassic (Hettangian) red beds are generally poor
in organic matter and maturation results from this stratigraphic
interval are confined to a few mudstone beds above the Silves
Sandstones and clay-rich evaporites in the Loulé and Albufeira di-
apirs (Figs. 1 and 2). Pliensbachian to Toarcian maturation results
are confined to the Sagres area in the Western Sub-Basin (Fig. 2). In
the Eastern Sub-Basin this stratigraphic interval is dominated by
dolomitised limestones of the Picavessa and Boavista Dolomites
(Fig. 2), which proved to be barren. The majority of data from the
Middle Jurassic is from the Callovian marlelimestone successions
which are widespread in the Algarve Basin (Praia da Mareta Marls
and Telheiro Marls) (Fig. 2). Most of the Upper Jurassic maturation
results are from the marlelimestone successions that straddle the
OxfordianeKimmeridgian boundary in the central Algarve (Peral
Limestones and Marls) (Fig. 2). Lower Cretaceous maturation re-
sults were recorded essentially from Berriasian to Barremian
shallow marine to continental deposits and from the widespread
Aptian to Albian lagoon-nearshore to shallow continental shelf
sedimentary facies of the Luz Mudstones and Porto de Mós Lime-
stones and Marls (Fig. 2).

The Ruivo and Corvina wells were drilled for hydrocarbon
exploration in the offshore part of the Algarve Basin by Chevron and
Challenger in 1975 and 1976 respectively. The stratigraphic position
of the samples analysed in the wells and the maturation results are
shown in Figure 3 and Table 2, respectively. The cuttings sampled
were marls, mudstones and siltstones. It was not possible to sample
the two wells systematically due to the lack of preserved material
through large intervals and to a lesser extent, to the presence of
unsuitable lithologies (crystalline limestones). The lithological and
biostratigraphic information provided here is from unpublished
reports (Chevron, 1975; Challenger, 1976) and from palynological
investigations completed during this study.

3.1. Extraction techniques and methods of study

Organic residues were extracted from the rock samples and
cuttings using standard cold hydrochloric (HCl) and hydrofluoric
acid (HF) techniques. The organic residues used for the maturation
studies were then mounted and polished using a method adapted
from that described by Hillier and Marshall (1988). Part of the
organic residue extracted from the samples was also mounted on
slides for spore fluorescence and spore colour determination. Part
of the organic residues from the Ruivo and Corvina well samples
was also mounted for palynology.

Mean random vitrinite reflectance (%Rr) was the vitrinite
reflectance (VR) parameter chosen for maturation assessment of the
Algarve Basin because the mounting technique used provides non-
oriented vitrinite particles and also because %Rr is the most widely
used organic maturation parameter in the oil industry and is readily
correlated with other maturity parameters. VR measurements on all
of the samples were made in the University of the Algarve using an
Olympus BX 51 microscope with a 50? oil-immersion objective lens
and equipped with a black and white digital camera. The black and
white (8-bit) digital images of vitrinite particles were analysed us-
ing a graphical tool, named VITRINITE, that runs within the Mirone
Suite (Luis, 2007) and calibrates the scale of 256 grey levels with
standards of known reflectivity (Fernandes et al., 2010). The
reflectance values of the standards used in this study were: 0.428%,
0.595%, 1.715%, 3.15% and 5.37%. VR was measured in incident light
with a wavelength of 546 nm and immersion oil with a refractive
index of 1.518 at 20 ?C room temperature.

When possible, 100 random reflectances were measured across
the slides and their arithmetic mean and standard deviation were
calculated (Tables 1 and 2). The arithmetic mean was considered to
be the true Rr for the sample. The accuracy of vitrinite reflectance
measurements depends on the precision of the reflectance micro-
scope and the number of grains measured. Mackowsky (1982)
regarded 100 measurements as a statistically valid size for a pop-
ulation and noted that 900 measurements would be required to
give three times the accuracy. McCormack (1998) concluded that
only 97 measurements are necessary for each sample to have a
precision of 0.1% with a 95% confidence interval with a standard
deviation of 0.5%Rr. If the number of measurements decreases to 30,
the same confidence interval and standard deviation implies a
precision of 0.18%. Therefore, the minimum number of VR mea-
surements regarded as statically valid in this study was 30. Not all
samples were rich in indigenous vitrinite and in some cases, the
reflectance of fewer than 30 particles was measured. However,
most of these relatively vitrinite poor samples belonged to strati-
graphic intervals that also included samples with VR measure-
ments based on more than 30 particles. In these cases and in order
to have a VR value characteristic of the stratigraphic sections, the
VR values measured from all samples of the same stratigraphic
sections were combined. In section 6. Organic maturation results,
the statistical procedures that were used in the treatment of VR
results from the same stratigraphic units are described. Tables 1
and 2 show all organic maturation results, both measured and
statistically treated. Figure 9 shows representative VR histograms
for the different stratigraphic units onshore and in the offshore
wells. The analysis of the VR results shown in some of the histo-
grams is discussed in the following sections.

Fluorescence microscopy is used to differentiate source rocks
from non-source rocks and to estimate the level of maturation from
fluorescence colours and spectra (Van Gijzel,1967,1971,1975,1979;
McPhilemy, 1988). Organic maturation causes a gradual shift in
fluorescence colours (red shift) from the shorter to the longer
wavelengths, that is, blue and green to yellow, orange and finally
red. Of all the sub-macerals of the liptiniteeexinite group, sporinite
is the one that shows the most consistent changes in fluorescence
colour spectra and intensity with increasing organic maturation.
Under fluorescence excitation, it changes colour from green
through yellow to orange and finally red, with increasing maturity
to the top of the oil-window, after which is no longer fluoresces.
Despite some differences in fluorescence colours and intensity for
different spore taxa, spore fluorescence is an important parameter
of organic maturation for low-rank material.

For this study, qualitative spore fluorescence colour analyses of
the samples were completed in the Department of Geology, Trinity
College Dublin using a Leitz Dialux 20 microscope with Ploemopak
2.4 incident fluorescent tube with a violet and blue þ12 filter block,
giving a wavelength band of 390e490 nm. This system was allowed
to stabilize for 30 min prior to any observation of the fluorescence
properties of the samples.

Suitable miospore species were subjected to 1 min of excitation,
after which their fluorescence colours were recorded. The termi-
nology used for describing fluorescent colours was: blue (B), green
(G), yellow (Y), dark yellow (DY), orange (O), dark orange (DO)
and red (R).

Palynologists have noted that spore colour in transmitted light
changes with increasing burial depth from light to dark. They also

noted, that these changes were progressive and irreversible. Using
colour changes of spores and pollen, Staplin (1969, 1977, 1982)
developed the Thermal Alteration Index (TAI) as a relatively sim-
ple and rapid technique for evaluating maturation levels in paly-
nological organic residues. The colour indices in Staplin’s TAI scale
range from 1 to 5 and represent spore colour changes from light
yellow to dark yellow, light brown, brown, dark brown and finally

succession of the Algarve Basin (Borges et al., 2011, 2012). In sam-
ples where this type of spore was absent, TAI was assessed using
pollen grains of Classopollis spp. because of its abundance
throughout the Algarve Basin succession, enabling correlation be-
tween the different sections and areas of the Algarve Basin.

dinoflagellates (Table 3). As with the foraminifera and calcareous
nanofossils (Chevron,1975), the palynological assemblage recorded
herein, does not give a precise age for this section.

The organic residues from the samples between 1714 and
1909 m (R5 to R11) are rich in phytoclasts, pollen and di-
noflagellates that are moderately to well-preserved. The most
abundant dinoflagellate taxa recorded in this interval include de
genera Ctenidodinium and Systematophora. Other taxa which are
consistently present include, Compositosphaeridium polonicum
(Plate 1, a), Gonyaulacysta jurassica subspecies adecta, Korystocysta
gochtii, Meiourogonyaulax caytonensis group (Plate 1, h), Pareodinia

ca. 1700 and 1900 m to be assigned to the mid to late Callovian
(Riding, 2005; Riding and Thomas, 1992) (Table 3). The occurrence
of Nannoceratopsis deflandrei subspecies deflandrei (Plate 1, l) in
sample R9 is considered reworked, since the range of this species is
restricted to the late Pliensbachianeearly Bajocian interval, being
more common in the ToarcianeAalenian. These data suggest
exposure and erosion of Lower Jurassic rocks in parts of the Algarve
Basin during the Callovian.

The four samples between 1934 and 2079 m that had been
assigned to the Hettangian by means of lithological correlation
were poor in palynomorphs. Long-ranging pollen such as Class-
opolis classoides and Alisporites spp. were the only palynomorphs
recorded in this interval (Table 3).

4.2. Corvina well, offshore

In all, 16 samples were studied for palynology. The organic
residues obtained were rich in phytoclasts and palynomorphs. Di-
noflagellates were the most abundant palynomorphs, followed by
pollen, prasynopytes, internal linings of foraminifera and acritarchs
(indeterminate and Micrhystridium spp.).

The dinoflagellate cyst assemblage recovered from samples
Co1eCo4, confirms the Miocene age for this interval that was
initially provided by other microfossil groups (Challenger, 1976).

The 12 samples between 1806 m and 2891 m yielded a
moderately diverse dinoflagellate cyst assemblage. The species
Endoscrinium luridum, Hystrichosphaerina orbifera, Systematophora
spp., Gonyaulacysta jurassica subsp. adecta (Plate 1, c) and
Gonyaulacysta jurassica subsp. jurassica are typical of the Oxfordian.
The chorate cysts Compositosphaeridium polonicum and Rigaudella
aemula are good markers for the mid Callovianemid Oxfordian
interval, the latter being more common from the late Callovian
onwards, and becoming extinct in mid Oxfordian times. Ctenido-
dinium ornatum (Plate 1, e) is a species that is typical of the late
Callovianemid Oxfordian interval, whereas the last occurrence of
Wanaea acollaris (Plate 1, k) is at the boundary between the Cal-
lovian and the Oxfordian stages. Small numbers of specimens of
Stephanelytron redcliffense (Plate 1, i) were identified in sample Co5.
The occurrence of this taxon is limited to the Callovianeearly
Kimmeridgian. Therefore, the most likely age for the interval be-
tween 1806 and 2891 m is early to mid Oxfordian (e.g. Riding, 2005;
Riding and Thomas,1992) (Table 4) and not the Lower Cretaceous to
Jurassic intervals as proposed in the report Challenger (1976).

5. Composition of the organic matter

This section is not a comprehensive account of the nature and
composition of the organic matter in the Algarve Basin. Our goal is
to describe the main trends observed in the composition of the
organic matter in the basin.

Although the stratigraphic succession of the Algarve Basin re-
cords a great variety of sedimentary environments spanning a
considerable time, the composition of the dispersed organic matter
does not vary greatly between the different lithological units.
Overall, the dispersed organic matter in the Algarve Basin is
dominated by terrestrially-derived particles such as phytoclasts,

spores and pollen. Black phytoclasts (inertinite) become more
important in the Cretaceous strata, possibly related to environ-
mental degradation by aridity, enhanced erosion rates, reworking
and oxidation of the organic matter in the continental source areas
(Tyson, 1993, 1995). Pollen and spores are also very common and
well-preserved, with the gymnosperm pollen Classopolis classoides
occurring commonly throughout the whole Mesozoic succession of
the Algarve Basin. Marine palynomorphs (dinoflagellates and
acritarchs) are not distributed evenly through the Algarve Basin
succession and never dominate the dispersed organic matter.
However, dinoflagellates are common and are invaluable strati-
graphically in the Bajocian to Callovian marlelimestone intervals of
the basin (Borges et al., 2011, 2012).

Amorphous organic matter (AOM) is never a major constituent
of the dispersed organic matter in any of the samples analysed, on
average constituting 15e20%. Even in the more marine marle
limestone succession with ammonoids, AOM rarely exceeds 50% of
total organic matter. Pyrite is common and appears as inclusions,
normally associated with palynomorphs and AOM.
6. Organic maturation results

In order to characterize the true thicknesses of the sections
studied and the accurate position of the VR values measured within
the stratigraphic succession, the Algarve Basin was divided into 4
areas, each with its own stratigraphy. Although the general strati-
graphic architecture of the Algarve Basin is similar in the 4 areas,
this division reflects the partition of the basin and the lateral
changes in thickness across the basin more accurately (Fig. 4). It
also facilitates better understanding of its thermal history. Thus, we
follow the partition of the Algarve Basin published by Manuppella
et al. (1988) with the key measured stratigraphic successions that
characterize each sub-basin, integrated with our own field
measured sections. The 4 areas considered are: SagreseLagos,
Albufeira, Faro and Tavira. The first area belongs to the Western
Sub-Basin whereas the other three areas belong to the Eastern Sub-
Basin. Figure 1 shows the limits of the areas considered and
Figures 5a, 6a, 7a and 8a the geographical location of the samples
studied of each area. The VR values shown in the stratigraphic
columns for each area are the mean values of all samples from the
time interval in the area considered (Table 1). The VR mean (med.)
and standard deviation (std.) for each stratigraphic interval in the
different areas were calculated from the equations:

med: ¼
X

ðxiniÞ=
X

nt

std: ¼ OðvarianceÞ

where, xi is the mean of each sample, ni the number of vitrinite
particles of each sample and nt the total number of vitrinite parti-
cles measured for each stratigraphic interval considered in the four
areas of the Algarve Basin (SagreseLagos, Albufeira, Faro and
Tavira) (Table 1).

The position of the calculated VR value in the stratigraphic
column for each area was placed at approximately the middle of the
lithostratigraphic units, when more than three VR samples were
measured. In stratigraphic sections with only one sample
measured, its position in the stratigraphic column was the
measured thickness between the sample and the closest strati-
graphic boundary, either the base or the top contact. For example,
in the SagreseLagos area, VR was measured from 20 samples in the
Callovian Praia da Mareta Marls. The calculated mean and standard



P. Fernandes et al. / Marine and Petroleum Geology 46 (2013) 210e233 225
deviation value of these 20 samples are 0.89% and 0.18%, respec-
tively (Table 1). Since this unit is approximately 70 m thick (Rocha,
1976; Borges et al., 2011) and through this thickness the VR values
does not change significantly, the position of the calculated mean
VR value was placed at the mid point of the unit, i.e., at ca. 35 m
from both the top (the plane of unconformity between the Middle
and Upper Jurassic) and the base of this unit (the contact between
the Praia da Mareta Marls and the underlying Praia da Mareta Marls
with Zoophycus) (Fig. 2). In the same area, the three samples
studied from the mid Oxfordian Praia do Tonel Limestones (samples
20, 21 and 22; Table 1) have a calculated VR mean of 0.81% and a
standard deviation of 0.10%. The samples are from the same outcrop
which is positioned 40 m above the Middle JurassiceUpper Jurassic
unconformity in the stratigraphic column.

The following comments apply to the VR results from all Algarve
Basin samples, regardless the age of strata or geographic position
where the samples are grouped only in terms of the main sedi-
mentary cycles (Upper TriassiceHettangian, Lower Jurassic, Middle
Jurassic, Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous). There is a clear
correlation between Rr values and the age of the strata. Rr increases
with the age of the rocks as follows: Lower Cretaceous 0.58e0.69%;
Upper Jurassic 0.78e0.88%; Middle Jurassic 0.85e0.95%; Lower
Jurassic 0.95e0.99% and Upper TriassiceHettangian 0.94e1.15%. In
calculating mean Rr for the Lower Cretaceous rocks, some of the
values measured from the Praia da Luz Marls and Porto de Mós
Limestones and Marls in the SagreseLagos area were not used,
because they are regarded as clearly anomalous (see section
below).

6.1. SagreseLagos

The SagreseLagos area corresponds to the part of the Algarve
Basin between Cape St. Vincent and Lagos, together with the Car-
rapateira Outlier, located approximately 20 km north of Sagres,
which is considered a northern extension of the main outcrop
(Fig. 1). VR was measured from Upper Triassic to Lower Cretaceous
(Albian) rocks (Fig. 5a). The composite stratigraphic thickness for
this area is ca. 1300 m (Manuppella, 1988; Rocha, 1976). Figure 5b
shows the mean Rr and standard deviation values for the different
stratigraphic levels sampled plotted against the depth of burial. The
mean Rr increases from 0.58% in the Albian Porto de Mós Lime-
stones and Marls, to 1.07% in the Upper Triassic Silves Mudstones.
Some VR values from samples collected between 50 and 200 m
from the intrusion contact at Praia da Luz and Praia de Porto de
Mós, are anomalously high for rocks of this age (Aptian/Albian) and
are interpreted as the product of heating by the Upper Cretaceous
igneous intrusive rocks that outcrop at Ponta das Ferrarias (Fig. 5a).
The effects of this rapid heating event are shown in the VR histo-
grams of the samples 1 and 14 (Fig. 9a and Table 1) belonging to the
same stratigraphic interval (Porto de Mós Limestones and Marls).
Sample 14 was collected from a bed less than 1 m from the contact
with the intrusion at Ponta das Ferrarias, whereas sample 1 was
collected from an outcrop far from any intrusives. VR increases
from 0.52%Rr in sample 1 to 1.68%Rr in sample 14. Spore fluores-
cence shows yellow colours in sample 1, but spores in sample 14 do
not show any fluorescence, which is consistent with the VR results.
TAI also show the effect of heating, changing from values of 2 in
sample 1 to a TAI value of 4 in sample 14 (Table 1). The effects of
Late Cretaceous igneous intrusions on the maturation of the
SagreseLagos area are more pronounced than predicted and
require further study.

Spore fluorescence and spore colour were also observed in the
samples analysed and, in general, agree well with the VR results.
Fluorescence changes from yellow in the Upper Cretaceous sam-
ples, to dark yellow/orange in the Middle Jurassic, and finally to
orange in the Upper TriassiceLower Jurassic samples. TAI for the
same stratigraphic interval increases from 2/2þ in the Lower
Cretaceous to 2þ/3? in the Middle Jurassic and 3?/3 in the Upper
Triassic (Table 1).

6.2. Albufeira

The outcrops in this area are located between the town of Silves
and the São Marcos da SerraeQuarteira Fault (Figs. 1 and 6a). The
stratigraphic succession is ca. 3000 m thick and consists of rocks
that range in age from Upper Triassic to Lower Cretaceous. Some of
the key outcrops in this area are located around the coastal town of
Albufeira and include the outcrop of the Albufeira Diapir. This
structure is situated adjacent to the EeW trending Baleeira Fault,
“an inverted Jurassic normal fault, which was intruded by the
Albufeira Salt Diapir during extension of the basin” (Terrinha,1998).
VR, spore fluorescence and colour were measured from Upper
Triassic mudstones situated in the S. Bartolomeu de MessineseVale
Fuzeiros area, from Hettangian evaporites of the Albufeira Diapir,
from mid OxfordianeKimmeridgian marls cropping out near
Albufeira town, from inland Lower Cretaceous mudstones and marl
outcrops between Paderne and Algoz and from the coastal section
at Praia dos Arrifes (Fig. 6a).

VR increases progressively with increasing age of the strata
(Fig. 6b), from a mean value of 0.60% in the Aptian Praia da Luz
Marls to a mean value of 1.0% in the Late Triassic Silves Mudstones
e Siltstones and Dolomites. Sample 64 (Table 1) of Lower Creta-
ceous contains clearly reworked vitrinite particles (Fig. 9f) with VR
above 0.8%Rr. This VR value was adjusted to include only the
indigenous vitrinite particles.

Spore fluorescence is consistent with VR and with fluorescence
colour and intensity. It also gradually changes with the increasing
age of the rocks. The samples from the Upper Cretaceous are
characterized by intense bright yellow spore fluorescence, whereas
dark orange and orange fluorescence colours were recorded in the
Upper Triassic and Hettangian samples, respectively (Table 1). TAI
values increase from 2þ in the Upper Cretaceous to 3? in the Upper
Triassic.

6.3. Faro

Figure 7a shows the VR results for the Faro area, which corre-
sponds to a large area in the central e east Algarve, south of the
Algibre Fault, where Upper Jurassic carbonates crop out extensively
(Fig.1). The stratigraphic succession in this area is the thickest in all
the Algarve Basin at ca. 3500 m, suggesting that this area was the
depocentre of the onshore part of the basin (Fig. 4). Of particular
significance in this area are the Lower Cretaceous sediments that
are more than 1000 m thick and which extend up into the Cen-
omanian (Rey, 2009) indicating that sedimentation in the Algarve
Basin continued through Late Cretaceous time.

Samples for maturation studies were collected from Late Triassic
(?) e Hettangian evaporites in the underground Loulé Salt mine,
from early Callovian marls in the disused Telheiro quarry, from
numerous Upper Jurassic (late Oxfordian to Tithonian) marl out-
crops and also from outcrops of Albianeearly Cenomanian (?)
marls. The ages of the Cretaceous samples are not very well con-
strained but field relations suggest a stratigraphic position close to
the top of the Cretaceous succession (Fig. 7b). A core of mudstone
from depth 46 m in a shallow groundwater exploration borehole
(JK) was also sampled, providing additional Early Cretaceous VR
data.

VR values from this area show a linear increase with the age of
the strata with a mean of 0.69% for the Early Cretaceous rocks and
1.02% for the Hettangian evaporites of the Loulé Diapir (Fig. 7b). The



P. Fernandes et al. / Marine and Petroleum Geology 46 (2013) 210e233226
observed spore fluorescence is consistent with the VR results with
fluorescence ranging from intense bright yellow in the majority of
the of the Lower Cretaceous samples, to orange e dark orange in
the Middle Jurassic and Hettangian. TAI values from the Faro area
increase from 2/2þ in the Upper Cretaceous rocks to a 3? in the
Hettangian evaporites of the Loulé Diapir (Table 1).

6.4. Tavira

This area corresponds essentially to the ca. 1800 m thick section
that crops out north of Tavira, along the banks of the Séqua river
(Fig 8a). In this section, maturation studies were completed on
samples of Callovian marls, Kimmeridgian to Tithonian marls and
Upper TriassiceHettangian mudstones. In addition, two Upper
Triassic mudstone core samples from a shallow groundwater
exploration borehole (NR) were sampled (NR1 and NR2 at depths of
156 and 158 m respectively).

VR results show a similar pattern to the other three areas. Rr
values increase linearly with age and depth of burial from a mean Rr
of 0.82% in the Lower Cretaceous to 1.10% in the Upper Triassic, near
the base of the local succession (Fig. 8b). Spore fluorescence and
colour results (Table 1) from the Upper Triassic and Callovian rocks
are fully consistent with the organic maturation levels determined
by VR. Orange spore fluorescence colours and TAI of 3? were
recorded in the Callovian samples. Orange spore fluorescence col-
ours and TAI of 3/3 were also observed in the Upper Triassic
samples.

In a single sample collected from the Miocene argillaceous
siltstones of the Cacela Formation, near Ribeira de Cacela, a Rr value
of 0.42% was determined. This value is considerably lower than the
values measured for the Mesozoic rocks and lies off the regression
line defined by the Mesozoic samples (Fig. 8b). Although this result
is only from a single sample, it is significant to understanding the
timing of maturation for the Mesozoic succession in the Algarve
Basin.

6.5. Offshore wells

The offshore wells, Ruivo and Corvina, intersected different
Mesozoic stratigraphic intervals in the Algarve Basin succession. In
the Ruivo well, a thick Middle Jurassic section (Callovian) overlies
Hettangian evaporites, whereas in the Corvina well, a thick Upper
Jurassic (Oxfordian) section was encountered (Fig. 3). The Mesozoic
strata in both wells are unconformably overlain by Tertiary clastic
rocks. This unconformity is also observed in the onshore part of the
Algarve Basin where Miocene bioclastic limestones of the Lagose
Portimão Formation generally rest unconformably on rocks of
Cretaceous, Jurassic or locally Carboniferous age. The presence of
Hettangian evaporites at the base of the Ruivo well indicates the
presence of a diapir that intruded the Middle Jurassic rocks.

Figure 3 shows the VR results from in both wells. Unfortunately,
the lack of continuous sampling precluded the estimation of
maturation gradients and detailed consideration of the thermal
history of the offshore part of the Algarve Basin. In the well Ruivo,
VR was measured in Callovian and Hettangian rocks from the lower
section in the well. In this interval Rr ranges from 0.94% to 1.06%
indicating that this part of the well section is within the late oil-
window. The orange to dark yellow spore fluorescence colours
and TAI ranging from 2þ to 3? (Table 2) that were recorded from
this interval confirm this conclusion. Moreover, the VR values
determined compare closely with the Middle Jurassic sections in
the onshore part of the Algarve Basin, especially the Middle Jurassic
sections of the Eastern Sub-Basin.

The VR of the Tertiary sample analysed at the top of the well (R1)
is complex. This sample shows two different populations of
vitrinite: one with a mean VR value similar to that of the Mesozoic
rocks (0.94%Rr) interpreted as reworked, and a second with a much
lower mean VR value of 0.47%Rr, regarded as the true indigenous
vitrinite population for this stratigraphic interval (Fig. 9). Although
indigenous vitrinite is rare in this sample (only 4 grains were
measured, Table 2), it is rich in palynomorphs, together with the
other Miocene samples (R2 and R3), whose fluorescence and TAI
colours are consistent with the two VR maturity populations in
sample R1. These samples show two different populations of
palynomorphs, one consisting essentially of spores with brown to
dark brown exines (TAI: 2þ/3?) and showing dark yellow and or-
ange fluorescence colours; the second consisting of spores, bissa-
cate pollen and dinoflagellates with transparent to light yellow
exine colours (TAI: 1/1þ) and intense blue/green fluorescence. This
clearly indicates the presence of an important reworked population
of palynomorphs and possibly also of vitrinite, since the indigenous
population of palynomorphs (the Miocene dinoflagellates prove
the age of this interval) indicates immaturity with regard to the oil-
window. Therefore, the highest VR population of sample R1 in this
well interval is interpreted as representing a reworked vitrinite
population. The possibility of the lowest VR population being caved
material can be discounted because the samples are from the upper
part of the well with negligible overlying strata.

In the well Corvina (Fig. 3), the most extensively sampled in-
terval comprises ca. 600 m of mid Oxfordian marls between 1800
and 2400 m. VR was also measured in Miocene mudstones and
from a marl sample located at T.D. VR for all Upper Jurassic samples
ranged between 1.07%Rr and 1.2%Rr and does not show any clear
increase with depth of burial. The values determined indicate a
position in late oil-window. Palynomorph fluorescence in this in-
terval varies from dark yellow, orange to dark orange, whereas TAIs
are 2þ/3?/3. These two organic maturation parameters suggest a
slightly lower maturation level than the VR results. The VR results
from the Upper Jurassic samples in this well are also higher than
those from the same stratigraphic levels in the onshore part of the
basin, especially in the Eastern Sub-Basin.

VR in the Miocene sample Co1, at the top of the well, shows a
bimodal population of vitrinite, a situation very similar to that
found in the Miocene samples of the Ruivo well. The VR value of the
indigenous population is 0.42%Rr, whereas the reworked popula-
tion is 0.91%Rr. The other Miocene samples in this well (Table 2)
only have reworked vitrinite populations. However, as observed in
the well Ruivo, they contain abundant palynomorphs which can be
divided in two populations on the basis of their fluorescence and
spore colours. A population of light-coloured palynomorphs that
includes the dinoflagellate species that provides the age for this
interval of the well, has intense blue/green fluorescence colours
and TAI of 1/1þ/2?, indicating immaturity with regard to the oil-
window. Dark-brown to brown palynomorphs (spores) are also
present showing dark yellow, orange and dark orange fluorescence
and a TAI of 2þ/3/3?. The organic maturation results from the
Miocene strata in both wells are very similar, with two populations
of organic particles, one indigenous with low maturation levels and
a second with reworked material indicating higher maturation
levels.

7. Thermal history

7.1. Palaeogeothermal gradients estimates

The VR results from the Mesozoic rocks of the onshore Algarve
Basin indicate that there is a clear relationship between maturity
and age (Fig. 5a, 6a, 7a and 8a) with maturation levels increasing
with increasing age of the strata, suggesting that burial was the
main process controlling organic maturation. Overall, the results



P. Fernandes et al. / Marine and Petroleum Geology 46 (2013) 210e233 227
strongly suggest that the conductive heating caused by burial was
the main cause of organic maturation in the onshore Algarve Basin.
The Rr values measured also indicate that most of the Mesozoic
rocks in the Algarve Basin are within the oil-window or the late oil-
window (sensu Peters and Cassa, 1994).

VR values from the same age strata are similar, regardless of
geographical location within the onshore Algarve Basin. Subsidence
rates during the Upper TriassiceLower Cretaceous interval varied
across the Algarve Basin with the highest rates recorded in the
Eastern Sub-Basin (Faro area) and the lowest in the Sagres Sub-
Basin (Terrinha, 1998; Terrinha et al., 2013) (Fig. 3). Therefore, for
this time interval, these two sub-basins of the Algarve Basin must
have experienced different geothermal gradients in order to pro-
duce the maturation levels measured.

Palaeogeothermal gradients have been modelled using the
empirical equation of Barker (1988) that computes peak palae-
otemperature from VR value ([T(?C) ¼ 104ln(Ro) þ 148], where
T(?C) is the maximum palaeotemperature attained by the rock and
Ro the VR value measured in the rock). The calculated palae-
otemperatures were used to estimate geothermal gradients and
also the amount of the eroded sedimentary sections of the areas
studied.

The calculated palaeotemperatures for all samples are shown in
Tables 1 and 2, and the modelled palaeogeothermal gradients for
the four areas of the onshore Algarve Basin are shown in Figure 10.
Palaeotemperatures used for constructing the palaeogeothermal
gradients were calculated using the mean VR values that were used
to construct the VR profiles of each area (Figs. 5b, 6b, 7b and 8b).
Figure 10. Calculated palaeogeothermal gradients of the four areas studied in the
onshore Algarve Basin.
Calculation of palaeogeothermal gradients is based on data from
the Upper Triassic through Lower Cretaceous interval, in order to
calculate geothermal gradients when sediments were at their
maximum burial depth and the amount of sediment removed.
Hence, a relatively high palaeogeothermal gradient of ca. 70 ?C/km
was calculated for the SagreseLagos area whereas the other three
areas, all belonging to the Eastern Sub-Basin, have lower palae-
ogeothermal gradients of ca. 17 ?C/km in the Faro area, ca. 31 ?C/km
in the Albufeira area, and ca. 37 ?C/km in the Tavira area. The
relatively low palaeogeothermal gradient in the Faro area could be
due possible to erroneous positioning of VR samples in the com-
posite stratigraphic column, especially in the case of the Cretaceous
value, the precise age of which is uncertain.

The palaeogeothermal gradients calculated for the Eastern Sub-
Basin are within the range of geothermal gradients that characterize
sedimentary basins developed in passive margin settings (Allen and
Allen, 2005; McKenzie, 1978). The much higher palaeogeothermal
gradient in the Western Sub-Basin is more difficult to interpret.
Locally elevated VR values observed in the AptianeAlbian sedi-
ments at Praias da Luz and Porto de Mós in the SagreseLagos area
are attributed to conductive heating related to a localized Late
Cretaceous igneous intrusion at Ponta das Ferrarias (see Section 6.1),
although outcrops close to igneous intrusions were avoided during
sampling in this area. With the exception of the two outcrops cited
above, this area is characterized by numerous intrusions that are
related to the Monchique Syenite Massif dyke swarm (Rock, 1978,
1982; Martins, 1999). The possibility that the elevated palae-
ogeothermal gradient in this area has been produced by concealed
igneous intrusions cannot be discounted. Regional elevation in the
geothermal gradient related to the intrusion of the Upper Creta-
ceous Monchique Syenite igneous body (González-Clavijo and
Valadares, 2003) is less probable, since it only intrudes Late
Carboniferous rocks and is located approximately 10 km from the
Algarve Basin (Fig. 1), though the geometry of its underground
extension is unknown. On the basis of the maturation data pre-
sented in this study for the SagreseLagos area, it is impossible to
determine whether the magnitude of the Late Cretaceous igneous
activity related to the Monchique Massif was sufficient to elevate
the local geothermal gradient, or if the high gradient was due to
other causes, such as close proximity to the North Atlantic rifting
axis. This requires further investigation.

7.2. Eroded cover estimates

The calculated palaeogeothermal gradients have also been used
to estimate the amount of eroded sedimentary cover in the area
studied. The method employed is after Bray et al. (1992) and is
summarised in Figure 11. It utilises the value of the palaeogeothermal
gradient (dT/dY)pal, the value of the palaeotemperature measured at
today’s surface (Ti at 0 m) and the likely surface palaeotemperature at
the time of maturation (Ts). The amount of the eroded cover is ob-
tained, assuming that the palaeogeothermal gradient was constant
through time, by dividing the difference (Ti ? Ts) for the value of the
palaeogeothermal gradient (Fig. 11). One problem of this method is
estimation of the palaeosurface temperature (Ts). Since the Algarve
Basin was located in the tropical zone for most of Mesozoic time
(Rocha, 1976; Terrinha et al., 2013) where mean temperatures are
normally ca. 20 ?C, this value has been used.

Applying this methodology for the Mesozoic palaeothermal
gradients calculated, the exhumation in the onshore Algarve Basin
before the deposition of Miocene sediments is estimated at a
maximum of ca. 4000 m in the Faro area and a minimum of 880 m
in the SagreseLagos area. In the Albufeira and Tavira areas, the
removed cover has similar thicknesses of 2225 m and 2430 m,
respectively. The most probable age for the removed cover is Upper

palaeogeothermal gradient is constrained and a palaeosurface temperature Ts is
assumed. (After Bray et al., 1992.)

Cretaceous (post-Cenomanian) to Palaeocene(?). The estimated
thicknesses of cover removed suggest either continuous sedimen-
tation in the Algarve Basin through much of Upper Cretaceous time
or a substantial section eroded at the base of the Miocene
unconformity.

7.3. Timing of maturation

The timing of maturation in the Mesozoic rocks in the Algarve
Basin is constrained by several lines of evidence. The first of these is
the break in the maturation trends between the mature Mesozoic
succession and the immature Miocene. This discontinuity was
found in both the onshore (Tavira area) (Fig. 8b) and offshore
sedimentary records (Fig. 3) implying that the timing of oil gener-
ation in the Algarve Basin is pre-Miocene. In the onshore Algarve
Basin Miocene rocks unconformably overlie tilted and folded Upper
Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous and even Late Carboniferous basement
rocks (Terrinha et al., 2013). No Palaeogene rocks are recognized
onshore, and if they were ever deposited here, they were eroded
prior to the deposition of the Miocene strata. In the offshore,
Palaeogene sediments were recognized in two wells, Algarve-1 and
Algarve-2 (Fig.1). In well Algarve-1, Eocene to Oligocene limestones
and dolomites unconformably overlie Lower Cretaceous clastic
rocks, whereas in well Algarve-2, a Palaeocene to mid Eocene
500 m thick succession of limestones and marls is unconformably
overlain by Pliocene clays (Terrinha et al., 2013). This evidence in-
dicates that there was no continuous sedimentation in the Algarve
Basin through the CretaceousePalaeogene and Palaeogenee
Neogene intervals. However, the lack of maturation data from the
Palaeocene rocks precludes better constraint of the timing of
maturation and the possibility that peak temperatures, and oil
generation were attained during Palaeocene times cannot be totally
discarded. However, we do not favour this last hypothesis on the
basis of our maturation data and other regional geological evi-
dence. Firstly, there is a lack of proven thick Palaeocene sequences
in the Algarve Basin, both onshore and offshore of the order of
magnitude that was estimated (Section 7.2. Eroded cover esti-
mates). Secondly, apatite fission track studies of the Carboniferous
rocks located north of the Algarve Basin boundary and the Mon-
chique Syenite Massif, indicate cooling ages of 113e111 Ma (Stapel,
1999) and 72 Ma (Terrinha et al., 2006) respectively. In the case of
the Monchique Syenite Massif the apatite fission track age is
approximately the same age of the emplacement (Miranda et al.,
2009), indicating that the intrusion of the batholith occurred at
shallow crustal depths and the Pennsylvanian greywackes and
shales intruded were between 60 ?C and 90 ?C (Terrinha et al.,
2013). This suggests that during latest CretaceouseEarly Palae-
ocene times basement rocks that surround the Algarve Basin, and
probably the Algarve Basin were subjected to active uplift and
erosion and not enhanced subsidence. Therefore, we suggest that
peak temperatures in the Mesozoic rocks of the Algarve Basin were
attained in Late Cretaceous times but prior to 72 Ma (Campanian),
episode that coincide with the intrusion of the Monchique Syenite
Massif.

Other evidence for this interpretation includes the presence of
reworked organic particles (vitrinite and palynomorphs) in the
Miocene strata of the offshore wells. The reworked VR particles
have similar values to the Mesozoic successions, implying that
some the Mesozoic succession of the Algarve Basin was exposed
and eroded during Miocene time. Possible extrabasinal sources for
the reworked organic particles are the Mesozoic rocks of the
Lusitanian Basin located in central littoral Portugal and the Meso-
zoic rocks exposed in the Betic Cordillera in southern Spain.

The Albufeira and Loulé diapirs also provide information on the
timing of maturation. In the case of the Albufeira Diapir, salt
movement was controlled by the eastewest trending Baleeira Fault
(Terrinha, 1998). The evaporites (halite and anhydrite) crop out in
the hangingwall block of the fault and were injected across the fault
zone, resulting in tectonic contact with Upper Jurassic and Lower
Cretaceous rocks. Halokinesis of the Albufeira Diapir was respon-
sible for the tilting and rotation to the vertical of the Lower Creta-
ceous rocks in contact with the evaporites at Praia dos Arrifes
(Fig. 12). VR measured in the Hettangian evaporites of the diapir is
1.15%Rr but is ca. 0.65%Rr in the Lower Cretaceous, implying that the
main halokinesis movement post-dates organic maturation. A
similar situation occurs in the Loulé Diapir, where the VR for the
Upper Jurassic rocks around Loulé is 0.78%Rr, whereas the Hettan-
gian evaporites have a value of ca.1.03%Rr, again suggesting that the
movement of the salt post-dates organic maturation. The main
phase of salt movement occurred in relation to the principal episode
of inversion of the Algarve Basin, which structural evidence, both
onshore and offshore, indicates is Late CretaceousePalaeogene in
age. It also suggests that the Algarve Basin was substantially uplifted
during Neogene times and a great deal of Mesozoic sediments was
exhumed (Terrinha, 1998; Terrinha et al., 1990, 2013).

7.4. 1D thermal modelling

The burial and thermal histories of the onshore Algarve Basin
were modelled using Schlumberger PetroMod 1D? software. The
basic data concerning the lithology, age and thickness of each rock
unit were taken from the key measured sections in the four areas
and from our own field observations. Input of the correct lithologies
into the model is very important since it controls parameters such
as compaction rates and thermal conductivities. Palaeoheat flow
(PHF) is another important parameter for modelling the tempera-
tureetime curve. The palaeoheat flow over time used in modelling
was after the work of Matias (2007) for the offshore Algarve Basin.
Palaeoheat flows were calculated for two episodes of rifting with
lithospheric stretching factors of b ¼ 1.5 for the Upper Triassic and

section is shown in Figure 6a (adapted from Terrinha, 1998).

P. Fernandes et al. / Marine and Petroleum Geology 46 (2013) 210e233 229
b ¼ 1.4 for the Cretaceous, values considered by Matias (2007) as
appropriate for the evolution of this basin.

The other boundary conditions that were used in modelling
were the palaeo-water depth (PWD) and the temperature at the
sedimentewater interface (SWIT). Depositional environment was
the only feature of the rocks that was taken into account to define
the PWD (in metres). SWIT was calculated from the palaeolatitude
of the Algarve Basin during the Mesozoic. As the Algarve Basin was
located within the tropical belt in Upper TriassiceLower Cretaceous
times, a temperature of 20 ?C was adopted as the SWIT value for the
shallow water carbonate rock units, whereas a temperature of 10 ?C
was used for marlelimestone sequences, representing deposition
in deeper and colder shelf areas (ca. 50e100 m water depth).

A critical point in the thermal history of the Algarve Basin
revealed by the analysis and interpretation of the VR data is that a
considerable Late Cretaceous sedimentary succession was eroded
prior to the deposition of the Miocene strata (see Section 7.2).
Moreover, peak temperatures were probably also attained in latest
Cretaceous times (see Section 7.3). These two considerations were
taken into account in the 1D thermal modelling rather than unre-
alistically high palaeoheat flows (and palaeogeothermal gradients)
that would be needed to fit the VR values if present day stratigraphic
thicknesses were used. An additional sedimentary cover of Upper
Cretaceous age between 100 Ma (Cenomanian) and 72 Ma (Cam-
panian), consisting of a carbonate sequence similar to the preserved
Lower Cretaceous with PWD of 10 m and SWITof 20 ?C was added to
the stratigraphic column of each area until the VR values and tem-
peratures modelled fitted the VR values measured. The other limit
applied to the model was that peak temperatures in the Mesozoic
succession were attained in latest Cretaceous times (ca. 72 Ma).
Modelling of the two offshore wells was not attempted due to their
limited stratigraphy compared to the onshore Algarve Basin.

Figure 13aed, shows the burial curves, together with the VR
values and palaeotemperatures modelled with the 1D PetroMod
model. For the burial curve of the SagreseLagos area (Fig. 13a), the
value for the Late Cretaceous palaeoheat flow was increased in
relation to the other areas to conform with the VR data from this
area. The values for the ‘best-fit’ Late Cretaceous cover thicknesses
and palaeogeothermal gradients derived from the modelled burial
curves for each area are: SagreseLagos area 2500 m and 52 ?C/km;
Albufeira area 2200 m and 27.5 ?C/km; Faro area 2000 m and
24.7 ?C/km and Tavira area 4000 m and 25.8 ?C/km.

For the areas situated in the Eastern Sub-Basin, the modelled
palaeogeothermal gradients are very similar and, with the excep-
tion of the Tavira area, a similar thickness of Upper Cretaceous
succession was also estimated. This does not imply a higher rate of
subsidence for the Tavira area, rather that more exhumation took
place here because part of the Lower Cretaceous succession present
in the Faro and Albufeira areas is missing. According to the
modelled burial curves, 2000e2200 m of Upper Cretaceous sedi-
mentary rocks must have been deposited to account for the VR
values measured in the Eastern Sub-Basin.

In the Western Sub-Basin, the modelled palaeogeothermal
gradient is approximately double (52 ?C/km) that in the Eastern
Sub-Basin (24.7e27.5 ?C/km) but the thickness of the Upper
Cretaceous sedimentary pile is 2500 m, of similar magnitude to that
in the Eastern Sub-Basin. This suggests that the process responsible
for the elevated regional palaeogeothermal gradient did not
enhance the subsidence rate in this sub-basin.

Comparison of the modelled palaeogeothermal gradients with
those calculated directly from the VR profiles by the Barker (1988)
equation for the Algarve Basin indicates that the latter are over-
estimated by ca. 5e10 ?C/km. The exception to this is the Faro
area, where the calculated VR palaeogeothermal gradient is
lower. However, this may be due to an incorrect positioning of
samples in the composite stratigraphic column, as mentioned
previously (Section 6.3). Thus, the values of the modelled palae-
ogeothermal gradients are better constrained when compared

with the calculated by the VR profiles using the Barker (1988)
equation, implying that the modelled thicknesses for eroded
Upper Cretaceous sedimentary pile are also more realistic. This is
also due to the fact that the model computes the evolution of the
palaeoheat flow and the petrophysical parameters (compaction,
rock thermal conductivities, etc.) over time, factors that are not
taking into account in computations using only the VR profiles.

8. Implications for hydrocarbon exploration

VR, qualitative spore fluorescence and TAI determinations
indicate that the Mesozoic succession in the onshore Algarve Basin
lies within the oil-window. The Hettangian evaporites have Rr ca.
1.1% and the Lower Cretaceous sediments ca. 0.52e0.7%. The
Mesozoic succession in the offshore wells, Hettangian and Cal-
lovian strata in the well Ruivo, and Oxfordian rocks in the well
Corvina, all lie within the late oil-window. Modelled burial curves
indicate that palaeogeothermal gradients for the onshore succes-
sions vary between 24.7 and 27.5 ?C/km in the Eastern Sub-Basin,
but a higher gradient of 52 ?C/km has been calculated for the
Western Sub-Basin. The cause of local elevation in the regional
palaeogeothermal gradients remains uncertain. These results,
together with regional geological evidence indicate that peak
palaeotemperatures were probably attained in late Cretaceous



Figure 13. (continued).

time. However, the potential source rock intervals probably
stopped generating from the moment the uplift of the onshore area
began, ca. 72 Ma. Modelled burial curves suggest that the Lower
Jurassic succession across the Algarve Basin entered the oil window
at the beginning of the Cretaceous and that peak oil generation
occurred in late Cretaceous time. Therefore, some of the Jurassic
and Lower Cretaceous sections in the Algarve Basin have consid-
erable potential as targets for future oil exploration.



P. Fernandes et al. / Marine and Petroleum Geology 46 (2013) 210e233232
Between 2000 and 2500 m of cover must have been deposited
and subsequently eroded in the onshore area in order to account for
the maturation levels measured. This implies continuous subsi-
dence and sedimentation during Late Cretaceous time up to 72 Ma.
Tectonic inversion of the Algarve Basin probably occurred during
the Palaeogene and was related to the onset of the alpine tectonism
and the emplacement of the Monchique Syenite (Terrinha et al.,
2002; Miranda et al., 2009). The low maturity of the Miocene
sediments (immature with respect to the oil-window) both
onshore and offshore proves that MioceneePleistocene reburial of
the Mesozoic succession did not increase its maturity.

Even though the Mesozoic succession lies within the oil-
window, oil shows are virtually absent in the Algarve Basin. The
presence of small amounts of oil filling fractures and pores in a
sample of jet recently found in the KimmeridgianeTithonian
Escarpão Limestones in the Eastern Sub-Basin (Fig. 2) confirms to
some extent the maturation levels established by our study (Costa
et al., 2010). The absence of oil shows may be due to the type of
organic matter observed in the organic residues of the rocks of the
Algarve Basin. The most abundant organic particles found in the
organic residues of the Algarve Basin are terrestrially derived (vit-
rinite and inertinite). This type of organic matter (kerogen type IIIe
II) is gas prone type rather than oil prone. However, another likely
explanation was that oil generated and trapped during burial
escaped from the reservoirs during the uplift events in the latest
Cretaceous and early Tertiary. Investigation of source rock quality
and quantity is beyond the scope of this work but a comprehensive
study is clearly needed in order to ascertain the stratigraphic dis-
tribution of the organic facies and source rock potential.

9. Summary and conclusions

VR results from 175 samples demonstrate that the Mesozoic
succession in the Algarve Basin lies within the oil window. VR
ranges from 0.52e0.70%Rr in the Lower Cretaceous to 1e1.1%Rr in
the Upper TriassiceHettangian section. Miocene carbonates and
mudrocks that unconformably overlie the Mesozoic strata are
immature with regard to the oil window. The Mesozoic successions
in the Ruivo and Corvina wells in the offshore part of the Algarve
Basin lie within the late oil-window. As in the onshore Algarve
Basin, Miocene rocks in these offshore wells are immature.

Palynological study of the offshore Ruivo and Corvina wells has
provided new stratigraphic information. In the Ruivo well, most of
the palynological productive Mesozoic section consists of thick
marls and limestones that yielded a dinoflagellate assemblage of
Callovian age. These rocks overlie evaporites of Hettangian age. The
Mesozoic section in the Corvina well yielded a dinoflagellate
assemblage of mid to upper Oxfordian age.

Modelled palaeogeothermal gradients in the Eastern Sub-Basin
range from 24.7 to 27.5 ?C/km, whereas a higher gradient of
52 ?C/km was modelled for the Western Sub-Basin. Peak temper-
atures in the Algarve Basin were attained during Late Cretaceouse
Early Palaeocene(?) time. To account for the maturation levels
determined in the onshore Algarve Basin, 2000e2500 m of cover
must have been eroded. This erosion occurred during much of
Palaeogene time and was due to the onset of the Alpine Orogeny.
Evidence for this event is provided by the considerable amount of
reworked vitrinite particles and palynomorphs found together with
the indigenous organic particles in the Miocene succession of the
offshore wells Ruivo and Corvina. The maturation levels of the
reworked organic material are similar to the levels of the Mesozoic
rocks of the Algarve Basin suggest, therefore, that parts of the basin
were already exposed and were being eroded during Miocene
times. Modelled burial curves suggest that the Upper Triassice
Hettangian section entered the oil window in Early Cretaceous time
and that peak temperatures of all the stratigraphic units were
attained in latest Cretaceous time.

This work is focused on the turbiditic sediments from the Carboniferous Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group (BAFG)
in the South Portuguese Zone, an external zone of the Iberian Variscides. The aim of this work is to constrain
the provenance and tectonic setting of these sediments in a context of a complex evolution of SW Iberian
Variscides. For this purpose, we performed a systematic study of petrographical and geochemical signatures
of greywackes and shales from the three BAFG formations: Mértola, Mira and Brejeira. Major and trace
element composition and ratios suggest heterogeneous source area composition for BAFG shales and
greywackes. For the oldest Mértola Formation greywackes, source area is dominated by granitoid rocks
with minor mafic input. The latter becomes residual in the Mira Formation. The youngest Brejeira Formation
greywackes show clear felsic affiliation associated with an increase in recycled components. The shales of all
three BAFG formations denote a granodioritic affiliation. Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) and Plagioclase
Index of Alteration (PIA) values suggest moderate weathering in the source areas of Mértola and Mira forma-
tions. These indices, together with A–CN–K relations, point out to steady-state weathering conditions in the
source areas of both formations. In contrast, both CIA and PIA values for the Brejeira Formation indicate var-
iable conditions of palaeoweathering, from moderate to intense, as a consequence of non-steady-state condi-
tions probably triggered by tectonic instability in the provenance area. Compared to the greywackes, the
shales of all three BAFG formations exhibit higher CIA and PIA values, as well as low K2O/Al2O3 (~0.2) and
index of compositional variability (b1), reflecting the cumulative effect of multiple cycles of sedimentary
recycling and prolonged chemical weathering history. Major and trace element distribution and upper con-
tinental crust-normalized multi-element plots suggest that the sediments of BAFG were derived mainly
from a continental arc/active margin with minor contribution from old continental crust. Together, our geo-
chemical data are compatible with BAFG sediments derived mainly from SW border of the Ossa Morena Zone
(Gondwanan affinity), with possible contribution from an external (Avalonian) source.

1. Introduction

Provenance analysis of siliciclastic sediments is a powerful tool in elu-
cidating the evolution of ancient sedimentary basins. Diverse techniques
based on petrographic and geochemical criteria have been successfully
used for this purpose (e.g., Dickinson and Suczek, 1979; Ingersoll et al.,
1984; Taylor and McLennan, 1985; Wronkiewicz and Condie, 1987;
McLennan, 1989; McLennan et al., 1990, 1993; Zuffa, 1991; McLennan
and Hemming, 1992). Geochemistry of major and trace elements of
siliciclastic rocks provides valuable information regarding the com-
position of the sediment source areas, palaeoweathering conditions,

hydraulic selection, recycling and, in some cases, the tectonic setting
of the sedimentary basins (e.g., Nesbitt and Young, 1982; Bhatia and
Crook, 1986; Fedo et al., 1995; Bauluz et al., 2000; Cullers and
Podkovyrov, 2002; McLennan et al., 2003; Armstrong-Altrin et al., 2004;
Slack et al., 2004; Veizer and Mackenzie, 2005; Etemad-Saeed et al.,
2011). A main premise relies on the assumption that certain trace ele-
ments (e.g., Th, Sc, Rare Earth Elements (REE)) tend to stay in a particulate
phase during weathering, erosion and transport, and thus are transferred
to a sedimentary record proportionally to their abundances in the source
area (McLennan et al., 1990).

Geodynamic and palaeogeographic reconstructions place the South
Portuguese Zone (SPZ, Fig. 1) as an external zone of the Iberian
Variscides and thus a possible western equivalent of the northern
Variscan belt (i.e. southwest England and Ireland, and Rhenohercynian
Zone of northwest Germany; Ribeiro et al., 1990, 2007; Oliveira and
Quesada, 1998; Franke, 2000; von Raumer et al., 2003; Nance et al.,

2010). Within the SPZ, several domains can be recognized, among them
a thick siliciclastic succession of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group
(BAFG). The BAFG is made up, from base to top, by three formations,
Mértola, Mira and Brejeira, deposited between Middle Viséan to
Moscovian times (Oliveira, 1983, 1990; Pereira, 1999; Pereira et al.,
2007, 2008). The deposition of the BAFG has been interpreted as a con-
sequence of the oblique collision between the SPZ, of Avalonian affinity,
and the Ossa Morena Zone, of Gondwanan affinity (Oliveira, 1990; Silva
et al., 1990; von Raumer et al., 2003; Ribeiro et al., 2007; Jorge et al.,
2012).

Previous provenance studies of BAFG have been limited mostly to the
paleocurrents and petrographic analyses of the Viséan Mértola Forma-
tion (van den Boogaard, 1967; Schermerhorn, 1971; Oliveira, 1983,
1988; Moreno, 1988, 1993; Moreno and Sáez, 1989). The source area
for the Mértola Formation sediments has been considered to derive
from terranes located to the north of the basin (so called Beja Geanticline,
SW border of the Ossa Morena Zone), actively uplifted during Lower and
Middle Carboniferous (Schermerhorn, 1971). An opposing view of van
den Boogaard (1967) and Oliveira (1983, 1988), proposes the Iberian
Pyrite Belt (IPB), together with limited input from external sources, as
a main source for Mértola Formation sediments. Moreno (1988, 1993),
and Moreno and Sáez (1989) favor the contribution of two coeval turbi-
dite systems fed from two different sources, the OMZ and the IPB.

In this work we present the first systematic study of the detrital
modes and major, trace and rare earth element distribution in
greywackes and shales of all three formations of the BAFG. The aim of
this study is to assess the potential variations in the palaeoweathering
conditions, source area composition and sedimentary recycling, to fur-
ther constrain the tectonic setting of basin in the context of evolution
of SW Iberian Variscides.

2. Geological and stratigraphic setting

The northern contact between the SPZ and the Precambrian–
Palaeozoic rocks of the OMZ is marked by the presence of the Beja–
Acebuches Ophiolite Complex, an important variscan suture. To the
south the SPZ is unconformably overlain by the Mesozoic rocks of the Al-
garve Basin (Fig. 1). The SPZ comprises rocks ranging from Middle Devo-
nian (or older?) to Pennsylvanian in age, which are organized into four
geological domains, from north to south: the Pulo do Lobo Antiform
(PLA), the IPB, the BAFG and the Southwest Portugal Domain (SPD)
(Oliveira, 1990; Oliveira et al., 2006). The core of the PLA comprises high-
ly deformed phyllites, quartzites, minor felsic volcanics and metabasalts
with MORB-type geochemical affinities (Munhá, 1983; Quesada et al.,
1994). In the northern and southern limbs of this antiform occur
siliclastic successions dated by palynomorphs from Lower Frasnian to
Upper Famennian (Pereira et al., 2006a). The geological setting of the
PLA within the SPZ is still controversial and is interpreted by some
authors as an accretionary prism related to a northward dipping subduc-
tion of late Palaeozoic Rheic ocean under the OMZ (Munhá et al., 1986;
Silva et al., 1990; Fonseca and Ribeiro, 1993; Quesada et al., 1994;
Nance et al., 2010) and by others as a complex antiform structure
resulting from the superimposition of an accretionary prism by a discor-
dant sedimentary basin contemporaneous to the IPB detritic substrate
(Oliveira et al., 2006; Pereira et al., 2006a).

The IPB is formed by the Phyllite–Quartzite Group (PQ) at the base
and the Volcano-Sedimentary Complex (VSC) at the top of the succes-
sion. The PQ comprises of a detrital sequence of shales and sandstones
with occasional bioclastic limestones in the upper levels (Oliveira,
1990). The PQ was laid down in a shallow water environment, possibly
a large marine siliciclastic platform affected by wave and storm events
(Moreno and Sáez, 1990; Oliveira, 1990; Moreno et al., 1996; Jorge
et al., 2007). The compositional maturity of the PQ sediments and
their geochemical and isotope signatures are consistent with a passive
continental margin depositional setting (Jorge et al., 2006, 2012).
The PQ's thickness is in excess of 1000 m and its base is not known.

The upper levels are dated as Middle to Upper Devonian (Givetian to
Famennian) based on various palaeontological indicators (Lake et al.,
1988; Oliveira, 1990; González, 2005; Pereira et al., 2008).

The VSC represents a submarine volcanic succession interbedded
with abundant siliciclastic rocks and minor Si–Fe–Mn exhalites
(Barriga, 1990; Oliveira, 1990). The magmatism in the IPB was gener-
ated within an intracontinental environment affected by transtensil
tectonics and is represented by a bimodal, predominantly felsic suite
(Munhá, 1983; Silva et al., 1990; Mitjavila et al., 1997). The architec-
ture of the felsic volcanic centers is defined by lava–cryptodome–
pumice cone volcanoes (Rosa et al., 2010). The volcanic rocks are sub-
ordinate, comprising only about 25% of the succession of the VSC
(Tornos, 2006). The siliciclastic rocks are represented by black shales,
purple shales and siltstones. The VSC hosts the world's largest
province of volcanic-hosted massive sulfides, of more than 88 deposits
including several giants and world class units (e.g., Barriga, 1990; Saez
et al., 1999; Tornos, 2006). The thickness of the VSC varies from
few tens of meters to more than 1000 m. Sediments interbedded
with the volcanics yielded palynomorphs (and rare conodonts) that
date the VSC from Upper Devonian to Upper Viséan (Oliveira, 1990;
Oliveira et al., 2004; Pereira et al., 2008).

The deposition of the BAFG turbiditic sediments resulted from the
inversion in the tectonic regime of the SPZ that started in the Middle
Viséan, as a consequence of the oblique collision between the SPZ and
the OMZ which created a major compressive regime. During this
phase the tectonic stacking created by south verging folds and thrust
faults allowed a development of a basin, probably a foreland, where
the BAFG accumulated (Oliveira, 1990; Ribeiro et al., 1990, 2007;
Silva et al., 1990).

The Middle to Upper Viséan Mértola Formation of the BAFG consists
of greywackes interbedded with shales, siltstones, rare conglomerates
and mudflow deposits. The majority of the greywackes exhibit sedi-
mentary features typical of proximal turbiditic deposits, organized in
several thinning-upward sequences resulting from lateral lobe migra-
tion and avulsion. Palaeocurrent studies in the Mértola region indicate
progradation of the turbidite lobes to S–SW (Oliveira, 1983, 1988).
Thick shaley intervals within the Mértola Formation turbiditic lobes
contain Upper Viséan ammonoids fauna and miospores. The Mértola
Formation is in excess of 1000 m thick (Oliveira, 1983, 1988). At the
boundary between the Mértola and the younger Mira Formation occurs
a laterally continuous 50–100 m thick belt of black shales and siltstones.
Uppermost Viséan ammonoids from these sediments may indicate a
period of major transgression ca. 330–328 My.

The Mira Formation comprises greywackes interbedded with shales
and rare conglomerate beds. The turbidites of the Mira Formation are
generally thinner bedded and have fewer sand-rich horizons than
those from the Mértola Formation. The few available palaeocurrent
data indicate southwest progradation of sedimentary lobes. Ammonoid
faunas from the Mira Formation shale beds point out a Serpukhovian to
Middle Bashkirian age (Oliveira, 1990).

The Brejeira Formation is made up by greywackes, shales and
quartzwackes, and, similarly to the other two formations, exhibits an
overall turbiditic character. The basal part of this formation comprises a
5 to 10 km wide belt, exhibiting thick beds of matrix poor quartzwackes
interbedded with shales (Oliveira et al., 1979; Oliveira, 1990). Another
belt comprising thick-bedded matrix rich greywackes and shales oc-
cupies a vast area to the southwest. Coarse-grained greywackes of this
last belt overlie the lithologies of the SPD, in some places on an erosional
contact. Palaeocurrents measured in the northern quartz-rich turbiditic
belt exhibit complex flow patterns with directions to SE and E and, at a
lesser extent, to the SW (Oliveira, 1983). In the coastal sections of the
Brejeira Formation flow directions of palaeocurrents are to the N. De-
tailed studies of the palynomorphs and ammonoid fauna of the Brejeira
Formation indicate ages ranging from the Upper Bashkirian (miospore
biozone FR), near the contact with the Mira Formation, to Lower
Moscovian (miospore biozone OT), in the coastal sections to the north

of Cape Saint Vincent (Pereira, 1999; Pereira et al., 2008). In Upper
Bashkirian–Moscovian times the progradation of the turbiditic deposi-
tion reached the SPD.

3. Sampling and analytical techniques

A total of 78 representative samples of shales and greywackes from
Mértola, Mira and Brejeira Formations were collected from outcrops
(60) and from mineral exploration boreholes (18) in the Portuguese
and Spanish sectors of the SPZ (Fig. 1a and b, respectively). Borehole
samples were collected from three mineral exploration boreholes
(AC1, CD1 and CD2) in the Portuguese sector of the SPZ. Figs. 1 and 2
show the geographic distribution of the samples and their stratigraphic
position within the BAFG units. The borehole samples all belong to the
lower levels of the Mértola Formation in close relation to the VSC. Bore-
hole AC1 (Alcaria da Cova) has a total depth of ca. 1000 m. The first
590 m of this borehole cut lithologies from the Mértola Formation
below which occurs stratigraphic contact with the VSC rocks. Boreholes
CD1 (Cidrão 1) and CD2 (Cidrão 2) show a ca. 200 m thick VSC succes-
sion thrusted over the Mértola Formation Greywackes and shales of the
Mértola Formation occur stratigraphically above the VSC succession, in
the hanging wall of the thrusted block. Thus, the samples collected from

borehole CD1 are from the Mértola Formation in the footwall of the
thrust block whereas the samples from the borehole CD2 are from the
hanging wall block (Fig. 1).

The studied samples were classified into greywacke and shale
based on regional geological comparison (e.g. Oliveira et al., 1979;
Oliveira, 1983, 1990) and petrographic study. A group of 41 thin sec-
tions of BAFG greywackes were studied in detail, of those 20 from
Mértola, 13 from Mira and 8 from Brejeira Formations. Point counting
of an average of 320 framework grains per sample was performed
according to the method of Gazzi–Dickinson (Ingersoll et al., 1984).
The cement and matrix (pseudomatrix) were not counted.

A group of 74 samples from boreholes (14) and outcrops (60)
were selected for the whole-rock geochemistry analysis. This group
includes 41 greywackes (5 borehole samples, 36 from outcrops) and
33 shales (9 borehole samples, 24 from outcrops). All samples were
cleaned and all weathering coats removed. Samples were ground in
an agate mill at the Geology Department of Faculty of Sciences of
Lisbon University.

The analytical procedures used were inductively coupled plasma-
optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) for major elements analysis
plus Ba, Sr and Zr; and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrome-
try (ICP-MS) for the majority of trace elements. All analyses were

performed at Activation Laboratories Ltd. (ACTLABS, Ontario, Canada)
following standard procedures for each method. Alkaline dissolution
with lithium metaborate/tetraborate followed by nitric acid dissolu-
tion was performed for all analyses, except for the determination of
Cu, Ni and Zn, for which acid digestion was carried out. The standards
used were: NIST 694, DNC-1, BIR-1, FK-N, NIST 1633b, SY-3, W-2, NIST
696, JSD-3, CTA-AC-1, WMG-1, GXR-1, MICA-FE, GXR-2, LKSD-3 and
MAG-1. Appendix 1 shows the analyses for three standard reference
materials (BIR-1, W-2a and DNC-1) and detection limits for each ele-
ment. The calculated reproducibility is better than 3% for major-
element contents (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3; Fe2O3, MnO, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O
and P2O5), b4% for rare earth elements (REE) and ?5% for high field
strength elements (HFSE). Additional information on analytical proce-
dures is available at http://www.actlabs.com. For the weight/weight
conversion from major oxides to atoms conversion factors were used,
according to Ragland (1989).

4. Petrography

The greywackes of the Mértola, Mira and Brejeira Formations exhibit
differences in the relative abundances of their major components,
quartz, feldspar and lithoclasts (Appendix 2). The average modal
compositions of greywackes from the Mértola, Mira and Brejeira Forma-
tions are Qt46.2F26.9L26.9, Qt61.7F7.6L30.7, and Qt83.1F6.7L10.1, respectively,
where Qt is the total quartz, F the sum of plagioclases and K-feldspar
and L is the sum of all lithic fragments (volcanic, sedimentary and
metasedimentary). Matrix constitutes 20–30% of all greywackes stud-
ied. The major clastic component of the Mértola Formation is quartz,
which shows rounded to sub-rounded forms. Quartz grains often
show diffuse boundaries and irregular contacts due to some degree of
dissolution into the matrix. In all samples, the contents in feldspar and
lithic components, mainly represented by volcanic rocks, vary signifi-
cantly (Fig. 3a, b). The abundance of opaque minerals, mainly diagenetic

calibrated clasts mainly composed of quartz. Abbreviations: Qt — monocrystaline quartz; Qtp — polycrystaline quartz: Pl — plagioclase; Ls — siliciclastic rock fragment; Lv — vulcanic rock

pyrite, is relatively high. Tourmaline and zircon are observed as the main
accessory minerals. In Mira greywackes, quartz is the major component,
occurring with rounded to angular forms. Lithoclasts of volcanic grains
are the second most abundant modal grains, with few exceptions
(Fig. 3c, d). Feldspars, as average, represent less than 10% of the clastic
grains. The occurrence of opaque minerals is relatively high. Accessory
heavy minerals are represented by zircon, rutile and tourmaline. Brejeira
greywackes are mainly composed of quartz and exhibit well-sorted
grains. Abundant quartz grains assume rounded to sub-rounded forms,
often with sutured contacts and showing the effects of pressure solution.
Lithoclasts are mostly composed by sedimentary and metasedimentary
grains. Volcanic grains are rare (Fig. 3e, f). Opaque minerals are relatively
abundant. Tourmaline, zircon and rutile are more abundant in the
Brejeira than both the Mértola and Mira greywackes.

In the QtFL provenance ternary diagram (Dickinson et al., 1983) the
greywackes from the BAFG do not fall into the same field (Fig. 4a). The
Mértola greywackes plot in the field of dissected magmatic arc and
recycled orogenic sources whereas the Brejeira greywackes plot almost
exclusively in the field of recycled orogenic sources. Mira samples plot
mainly in the recycled orogenic field, showing a distribution stretching
from Brejeira to Mértola samples. On the QmFLt triangular diagram
(monocrystalline quartz, feldspar and total lithic fragments) the
Mértola, Mira and Brejeira greywackes all exhibit a similar distribution
patterns (Fig. 4b; after Dickinson et al., 1983). These data suggest the
initial derivation of the BAFG sediments from the dissected magmatic
arc, with gradual increase in recycled components, most pronounced
in the youngest Brejeira Formation.

5. Whole-rock geochemistry

Mean chemical composition, variation range and standard devia-
tion for shales and greywackes from the three BAFG formations are
listed in Table 1, and Appendix 3 contains geochemistry analyses for
all samples. The geochemistry data for borehole and outcrop samples
are presented together, since no statistically significant compositional
differences between these two groups were found. Fig. 5 shows plots
of average major and trace elements from the BAFG greywackes and
shales normalized to UCC values (Taylor and McLennan, 1985).

5.1. Major elements

The geochemistry of major elements clearly reflects the mineralogy
of the greywackes from the three BAFG formations (Table 1). Average

SiO2 and Al2O3 in Mértola greywackes are 64.8±3.4% and 15.8±1.8%,
respectively. Similar values are recorded for the Mira Formation
(SiO2=68.8±5.8% and Al2O3=13.2±1.7%). The Brejeira greywackes
show higher SiO2 (78.1±5.7%) and lower Al2O3 (9.0±1.2%) contents
reflecting a greater amount of detrital quartz in these rocks. Shales
from Mértola, Mira and Brejeira have average SiO2 content of 58.1±
1.6%, 55.3±3.3% and 54.1±2.8%, respectively. The Al2O3 contents for
these rocks are similar (Mértola=19.0±0.9%, Mira=22.2±2.0%,
Brejeira=24.0±1.9%).

The index of compositional variability (ICV) [(Fe2O3+K2O+Na2O+
CaO+MgO+MnO+TiO2)/Al2O3] can be used as a measure of compo-
sitional maturity of mudstones (Cox et al., 1995). Immature mudstones
rich in non-clay silicate minerals show ICV values greater than one.
In contrast, more mature mudstones exhibit values below one,
reflecting mineralogy with the predominance of clay minerals (Cullers
and Podkovyrov, 2002). The average values of ICV for the Mértola,
Mira and Brejeira shales are 0.9±0.05 (1.0–0.8), 0.7±0.1 (0.8–0.5)
and 0.6±0.03 (0.7–0.6), respectively. The mean K2O/Al2O3 ratio for all
groups of analyzed shales is ~0.2. Together, the ICV values and the
K2O/Al2O3 ratios suggest compositional maturity of the BAFG shales
(Table 2).

Greywackes of Mértola, Mira and Brejeira Formation have average
K2O/Na2O ratios of 0.7±0.7 (3–0.3), 0.9±0.5 (2.5–0.5) and 2.6±2.2
(6.4–1.0), respectively Table 2. In the ternary plot (Fe2O3+MgO)?
Na2O?K2O of Blatt et al. (1980) Mértola and Mira greywackes plot
along the fields of sodic and ferromagnesian potassic (Fig. 6). All but
one Brejeira greywackes are limited to the field of ferromagnesian
potassic.

Compared with the UCC values, all analyzed greywackes, with
the exception of Brejeira ones, exhibit similar MgO contents and
have slightly higher TiO2, Fe2O3 and MnO. Variable depletion in
CaO, Na2O and K2O is observed (Fig. 5a). Shales show a similar
pattern, with a generalized slight enrichment in K2O and variable
depletion in MgO (except for the Mértola Formation), CaO and
Na2O (Fig. 5b).

SiO2 exhibits variable negative correlation with Al2O3, TiO2, Fe2O3,
K2O, MnO, MgO and P2O5 for all analyzed greywackes, reflecting the
quartz dilution effect (Fig. 7a–d). Al2O3 correlates well with K2O,
Fe2O3 and TiO2 (Fig. 7e). In the shales, SiO2 also shows negative corre-
lation with a majority of major elements, and Al2O3 shows positive
correlation with K2O, MgO, Fe2O3 and TiO2 (Fig. 7a–e). This suggests
that chemical weathering in the source area was a dominant factor
controlling the mineralogy of weathered products. In fact, during

chemical weathering Al and Ti tend to be stable or residual; K and Mg
are fixed in clay minerals, while Ca is usually bleached (Feng and
Kerrich, 1990).

5.2. Trace elements

As expected, average trace elements concentrations of the BAFG
greywackes are lower than those in the shales, due to the quartz dilu-
tion effect. With the exception of the Brejeira, all other greywackes ex-
hibit variable enrichment in transition trace elements (TTE) Sc, V, Cr, Ni
and Co relative to the UCC (Fig. 5c). In Mértola and Mira greywackes, the
degree of enrichment undergoes great sample-to-sample variability,
although this is more pronounced in the Mértola Formation. Large Ion
Lithophile Elements (LILE) concentration in greywackes is generally
lower than in the UCC. The BAFG shales exhibit enrichment in TTE sim-
ilar to those observed in greywackes (Fig. 5d). The enrichment in Rb, Ba
and Cs, together with the depletion in Sr, is consistent with the geo-
chemical behavior of K and Ca.

Sc, V and Cr in shales and greywackes show moderate to strong pos-
itive correlation with Al2O3 and K2O (Fig. 7f–h), suggesting that abun-
dances of these elements are controlled by K-bearing phyllosilicates.
With the exception of Mértola Formation, all analyzed greywackes
exhibit variable enrichment in Zr compared to the UCC (190 ppm;
Taylor and McLennan, 1985), best pronounced in Brejeira greywackes,
where average Zr content is 286±48 ppm (389–233 ppm), probably
reflecting an increased influence of hydraulic selection and/or sedimen-
tary recycling. All greywackes and shales exhibit high positive correla-
tion between Zr–Hf and Nb–Ta indicating that both pairs of elements
are fixed in zircon and rutile. Additionally, Th and Al2O3 show positive

correlation in all analyzed rocks, once again pointing out the impor-
tance of phyllosilicates in controlling their abundances.

5.3. Rare earth elements

The average of total of REE (?REE) contents for Mértola, Mira and
Brejeira greywackes (139, 131 and 137 ppm respectively) are slightly
less than the UCC (146.4 ppm; Taylor and McLennan, 1985). Shales
from the three formations have variable enrichment in ?REE
(Mértola=177, Mira=230 and Brejeira=253 ppm) relatively to
the UCC.

As illustrated in Fig. 8, average chondrite-normalized REE patterns
(Taylor and McLennan, 1985) of analyzed rocks are enriched in light
REE (LREE) (Lan/Smnb5), with the flattened patterns of heavy REE
(HREE) (Gbn/Ybn: 1.5–2). The Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu*) is variable. For
Mértola, Mira and Brejeira greywackes the values of Eu/Eu* are
0.84±0.10, 0.75±0.08, and 0.68±0.01, respectively. In shales these
values are 0.66±0.07 for Mértola, 0.73±0.05 for Mira, and 0.72±
0.02 for Brejeira Formation.

?LREE and ?HREE of analyzed shales show weak positive corre-
lation with Al2O3. Additionally, ?HREE of Mira and Brejeira shales
show strong positive correlation with Y (r=0.99 and r=0.73, re-
spectively) reflecting the role of Y-rich minerals in the control of
REE contents of these rocks. ?LREE and ?HREE of Mértola
greywackes exhibit significative positive correlation with Al2O3 (r=
0.74 and r=0.89), TiO2 (r=0.63 and r=0.80) and Y (r=0.90 and
r=0.99). ?HREE in these rocks do not correlate with P2O5. ?LREE
and ?HREE of Mira greywackes show positive correlation with
Al2O3 (r=0.55 for both) and P2O5 (r=0.55 and r=0.66). In the

Brejeira greywackes, ?LREE show weak correlation with TiO2 (r=
0.45) while ?HREE correlate weakly with Al2O3 (r=0.44) and
P2O5 (r=0.67). Only in these greywackes that strong correlation of
?HREE with TiO2 (r=0.91), Zr (r=0.75) and Y (r=0.98) is ob-
served. Collectively, these correlations suggest the variable influence
of several mineralogical phases, such as phyllosilicates, phosphates
and zircon, on the control of REE contents of BFGA lithologies.

6. Palaeoweathering conditions

Weathering intensity at the source area is one of the main factors
which influence both the mineralogy and the alkaline and alkaline
earth element concentration of siliciclastic rocks. Large ionic radius
cations such as Cs, Rb and Ba are preferentially fixed in weathering
profiles through adsorption on clays, while smaller cations like Na,
Ca and Sr are selectively leached from them (Nesbitt et al., 1980).
The Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) proposed by Nesbitt and
Young (1982) is particularly useful because it reflects the intensity
of chemical weathering in the source area while also allowing a quan-
titative measure of the amount of chemically weathered materials in-
cluded in siliciclastic rocks (Nesbitt, 2003). CIA varies from ?50 for
unweathered igneous rocks to near 100 for residual clays enriched
in kaolinite and Al oxi-hydroxides. This index is calculated using
molar proportions of the following oxides: CIA=[Al2O3/(Al2O3+
CaO*+Na2O+K2O)]×100, where CaO* is the amount of CaO in-
corporated in the silicate fraction of the sample only, after correc-
tion for Ca contained in carbonate (McLennon, 1993; Fedo et al.,
1995).

The CO2 contents were not analyzed in this study. Majority of
studied samples show very low average CaO content (b2%, Table 1
and Appendix 3). In few samples, where petrographic examination
revealed a presence of carbonates, the CIA value was corrected
according to McLennon (1993).

Mértola and Mira greywackes exhibit average CIA values of 66.3±
4.0 and 71.2±2.8, respectively Table 2. Within each formation, CIA
values for greywackes show reduced variation, ranging from 61.5 to
74.0 in Mértola greywackes and from 67.0 to 76.6 in Mira. Average
CIA values for Mértola and Mira shales are higher as compared to
greywackes (71.1±3.5 and 78.1±1.8, respectively) and also show a
reduced range of variation (64.5–74.8 and 74.7–81.2, respectively).
The increased CIA values for shales of both formations should have
resulted from prolonged chemical weathering associated with multi-
ple cycles of sedimentary recycling (see below). All together, CIA
values for Mértola and Mira greywackes and shales point out to
moderate weathering conditions at the source area. The reduced

range of variation of CIA values suggests steady-state weathering
conditions in source area resulting from stable rates of chemical
weathering and erosion over time (Nesbitt et al., 1997; Nesbitt,
2003).

Brejeira Formation shales exhibit average CIA values of 78.9±1.0
(77.3–80.2). CIA values for Brejeira greywackes show an average of
74.6±6.9 and vary from 63.3 to 83.0. Within this range, the highest
CIA values are associated with samples from the base of the Brejeira For-
mation, while lower values belong to the top of this unit. Collectively,
these values suggest moderate to intense chemical weathering condi-
tions. The range of CIA values is clearly reflected in the A–CN–K
(Al2O3?(CaO*+Na2O)?K2O) diagram, where Brejeira greywackes
project continuously along the ideal weathering trend parallel to A–
CN line (Fig. 9). The data point out to the non steady-state conditions
of the source area weathering for the Brejeira Formation rocks, resulting
from changing rates of chemical alteration and physical erosion over
time, probably as a consequence of tectonic instability in the source
area (e.g., Nesbitt et al., 1997; Nesbitt, 2003; Lee, 2009).

The degree of source weathering and elemental distribution during
diagenesis can also be estimated using the related Plagioclase Index of
Alteration (PIA) (Fedo et al., 1995), calculated using molar proportions
of the following oxides: PIA=[(Al2O3?K2O)/(Al2O3+CaO*+Na2O?
K2O)]×100, where CaO* is the amount of CaO incorporated in the silicate
fraction of the rock only. Unweathered plagioclase has PIA value of 50,
while Post Archaen Average Shale (PAAS) has PIA values of 79.

Mértola and Mira greywackes exhibit average PIA values of 69.9±
6.5 (63.2–85.1) and 76.4±4.3 (70.1–86.1), respectively. The Brejeira
greywackes show average PIA values of 82.5±9.9 (67.2–94.6), indi-
cating an increase in PIA values from the base to the top of the
BAFG succession. The range of PIA values in these greywackes is a
consequence of a variable degree of conversion of feldspars to clay
minerals. As expected, Mértola, Mira and Brejeira shales exhibit
higher PIA values compared to greywackes, respectively, 80.5±5.4
(70.4–88.5), 91.7±2.4 (87.8–94.9) and 93.5±1.6 (91.5–96.1),
reflecting phyllosilicate-dominated mineralogy. Both CIA and PIA
values suggest that from Middle Viséan to Moscovian times, the
source area of the BAFG experienced variable chemical weathering
conditions, which become more severe to the top of stratigraphic suc-
cession, probably related to the tectonic instability in the provenance
area (see discussion below).

7. Source rock composition

The chemical composition of the source area for siliciclastic sedi-
ments can be inferred from the triangular diagram A–CN–K (Al2O3?
(CaO*+Na2O)?K2O); where CaO* is the amount of CaO incorporated
in the silicate-bearing minerals. As the weathering trends are parallel
to the A–CN boundary, a regression can be made by backward projec-
tion relatively to the feldspar join line, to infer the composition of the
source area (Nesbitt and Young, 1984, 1989; Fedo et al., 1995).

On the A–CN–K diagram (Fig. 9) the Mértola greywacke samples
project in several trends parallel to the A–CN, where regression lines
intercept plagioclase–alkali feldspar join mainly along granodioritic
and granitic source and to a lesser extent, basaltic source. Mira and
Brejeira greywackes exhibit lower degree of dispersion, and the re-
gression lines project between the fields of granodioritic and granitic
composition. The shales from all three BAFG formations project
along the “trend” defined by PAAS and North American Shale Compo-
sition (NASC), within a granodioritic source composition (Fig. 9). The
low degree of dispersion between analyzed shales may also represent
a cumulative effect of multiple phases of sedimentary recycling
(cf. McLennan et al., 1993). Accordingly, the shales from three BAFG
formations exhibit low values of ICV (b1) and K2O/Al2O3 (~0.2) con-
sistent with the predominance of clay minerals that may have resulted
from a lower input of first cycle detritus coupled with the recycling of
sedimentary material (Cox et al., 1995). This conclusion is also

Fig. 6. Classification of the BAFG greywackes according to Blatt et al. (1980).

142 R.C.G.S. Jorge et al. / Sedimentary Geology 284–285 (2013) 133–148



supported by consistently higher CIA values for BAFG shales
when compared with associated greywackes. In fact, as shown by
McLennan et al. (1990), in turbiditic sequences muds tend to have
higher CIA values than associated sands, as a consequence of extensive

history of chemical weathering coupled to multiple cycles of sedimen-
tary recycling.

The provenance of BAFG sediments can be also inferred from the
geochemistry of selected trace elements. This is based on the fact

143R.C.G.S. Jorge et al. / Sedimentary Geology 284–285 (2013) 133–148



that during weathering, erosion and transport, certain trace elements
stay virtually insoluble and are transferred almost quantitatively to
the sedimentary record and, consequently, bear the signature of the
parental rock (McLennan et al., 1983, 1993; Taylor and McLennan,

1985; Bhatia and Crook, 1986; Feng and Kerrich, 1990; Cullers,
1995; Armstrong-Altrin et al., 2012). Among all useful trace elements
(e.g. Th, Sc and HFSE), the REE have the advantage of not being easily
fractionated during the sedimentation process, allowing to consider
the REE pattern of siliciclastic rocks as an average representative of the
source area composition (McLennan, 1989; Cullers, 1995; Mongelli
et al., 1996; Bauluz et al., 2000). Additionally, the LREE/HREE ratio and
the Eu anomaly value vary according to the chemical composition of
the source. A majority of felsic rocks have variable degree of negative
Eu anomalies, while basic rocks show a small or inexistent negative Eu
anomaly (Cullers et al., 1987; Cullers, 1995). The fine-grained sediments
seem to preserve the size of the negative Eu anomalies (Cullers et al.,
1987).

The normalized patterns of shales and greywackes from three
BAFG formations are characterized by a sharp enrichment in LREE
and the flattened HREE patterns (see Fig. 8 and Table 1 and 2). The
Eu/Eu* ratio ranges between 1.02–0.65 and 0.92–0.62 in greywackes of
Mértola and Mira formations, respectively. However, in greywackes
from both formations only a limited number of samples exhibit small or
absent negative Eu/Eu* ratios. In shales, the Eu/Eu* values are 0.79–0.56
(0.66±0.07) in the Mértola Formation and 0.85–0.66 (0.73±0.05) in
the Mira Formation The range of Eu/Eu* values for both lithologies is
compatible with a heterogeneous source area of mostly felsic composi-
tion with a minor contribution from basic rocks (see discussion below).
The Brejeira shales and greywackes exhibit less variable Eu/Eu* ratios,
0.74–0.70 and 0.70–0.67, respectively, compatible with a plutonic felsic
and/or reworked sedimentary source.

According to Feng and Kerrich (1990) and McLennan et al. (1990),
Th and Sc are particularly useful to constrain source area composition
of siliciclastic rocks, largely because no fractionation is known to be
associated to these elements in the sedimentary cycle. Th and Sc are
enriched in felsic and basic rocks, respectively, and their elemental
ratio is very sensitive to compositional variations associated to the
provenance area (McLennan et al., 1990). In addition, the Zr/Sc ratio
is a reliable index of sedimentary recycling processes, because of the
resistance of zircon to chemical weathering and erosion. In first
cycle sediments, Th/Sc and Zr/Sc ratios tend to correlate positively,
depending on the source rock composition, while in more mature or
recycled rocks Zr/Sc varies considerably, contrasting with the small

variation in the Th/Sc ratio (McLennan et al., 1993). On the Th/Sc
versus Zr/Sc plot (Fig. 10) the BAFG rocks show considerable variation
in Zr/Sc ratio, with a group of samples clustering close to the UCC and
PAAS. Higher Zr/Sc ratios of Mira and Brejeira greywackes reflect Zr
enrichment as a result of higher degree of sedimentary recycling,
most pronounced in the case of the Brejeira rocks.

To assess the degree of felsic vs. mafic contribution in the BAFG
sediments, all samples were projected on Eu/Eu* versus Th/Sc diagram
(Fig. 11). On this diagram, the majority of samples plot within the fields
of unevolved felsic source and to a lesser extent, on evolved felsic
source. A small number of greywacke and shale samples from Mértola
and Mira Formation fall into the field of mafic source (Th/Scb0.5 and
Eu/Eu*&gt;0.7) or on the boundary between the two fields. Samples with
higher Th/Sc ratios do not seem to contain any mafic contribution
(Slack et al., 2004).

The La/Sc, Th/Sc, La/Co and Cr/Th ratios of different igneous and
sedimentary rocks are shown in Table 3, in comparison to the BAFG
rocks analyzed in this study. The diverse critical provenance ratios
suggest the predominance of felsic over mafic sources in the source
area of the BAFG, with many of values close to the UCC.

8. Paleotectonic setting

To identify the tectonic setting of ancient sedimentary basins, several
geochemical indicators and discriminating diagrams based on major and
trace elements have been proposed (e.g. Bhatia, 1983; Bhatia, and Crook,
1986; Roser and Korsch, 1986, 1988). In these diagrams, sediments are
grouped into three or four categories based on their bulk geochemical sig-
nal (e.g., oceanic island arc, continental arc, active continental margin,
Bhatia, and Crook, 1986). The widespread applicability of these geochem-
ical indicators for the interpretation of palaeotectonic settings has been
favored by some authors and questioned by others (e.g. Winchester and
Max, 1989; McLennan et al., 1990, 1993; Floyd et al., 1991; Slack and
Stevens, 1994; Toulkeridis et al., 1999; Armstrong-Altrin and Verma,
2005; Ryan and Williams, 2007).

To infer the palaeotectonic setting of the BAFG, all analyzed samples
were projected on the La–Th–Sc diagram proposed by Bhatia and Crook
(1986), where the majority of shales and greywackes consistently
project within the continental island arc field, indicating a dissected
magmatic arc as a source terrane (Fig. 12). However, a small number
of Brejeira greywackes plot outside the pre-defined fields.

Floyd et al. (1991) proposed multi-element diagrams normalized to
UCC to assess tectonic settings for coarse siliciclastic rock deposition,
using as a reference the average data for greywackes from common tec-
tonic environments (Fig. 13). On these diagrams, the elements are ar-
ranged, from right to left, in order of increasing ocean residence times
and fall into two groups, a more stable (Th–Ta) and more mobile (Ni–
K) one. This approach allows the recognition of a number of source-
and tectonic environment discriminating features: (i) the Nb/Nb* ratio
(actual normalized Nb abundance divided by predicted normalized Nb
abundance based on extrapolation between Ni and Ti), which is typically
low for sources derived from subduction-related magmatic rocks; the
anomaly is less pronounced for passive margins involving reworked
continental crust and is influenced by the contribution of mafic material
in the source area; (ii) relative abundance of V, Cr, Ni, Ti and Sc: typical
values for this anomaly are &gt;1 for active margins and b1 for passive
margins; and (iii) relative abundance of Ti, Hf, Zr and Y: positive values
of Ti–Hf–Zr–Y anomaly reflect heavy mineral input (mainly zircon), and
for passive margins the values are &gt;1 (Floyd et al., 1991).

Using the normalization proposed by Floyd et al. (1991, Fig. 13),
the greywackes of the three BAFG formations exhibit a generalized
depletion in Ta–Nb and variable enrichment in V–Cr–Ni–Ti–Sc. V
and Ni values for Brejeira greywackes are close to 1. The same is
true for the Ni in the Mira greywackes. With the exception of Mértola
greywackes, a positive anomaly in Hf–Zr–Y is observed, consistent
with the enrichment in heavy minerals. The enrichment in Hf–Zr–Y

is observed from the base to the top of BAFG succession, accompanied
by the gradual depletion in Sr. Normalized multi-elemental patterns
of different analyzed greywackes point out a geodynamic setting of
continental arc/active margin, despite the enrichment in Hf–Zr–Y
and pronounced negative anomaly in Sr, typical of passive margins

where sedimentary recycling processes play an important role
(McLennan et al., 1990). The presence of these two types of signatures
is common in active margins, where sedimentation is characterized by
a mixture of young arc-derived material of variable composition
and old upper crustal material (McLennan et al., 1990, 1993). The
UCC-normalized multi-elemental patterns observed in the three BAFG
formations indicate the contribution of the SW border of the OMZ as
an important source for these sediments, in agreement with the envi-
ronment of oblique collision between the SPZ and the SW border of
the OMZ. As a consequence of this collision, the SW border of the
OMZ was rapidly uplifted during Carboniferous times (Oliveira et al.,
2006; Jesus et al., 2007; Rosas et al., 2008). The rapid uplift and intense
erosion to which this region was subjected since the late Tournaisian
are well documented in the Cabrela and Toca da Moura sedimentary ba-
sins (Pereira et al., 2006b). However, an intrabasinal (i.e., the IPB) input
of sediments for the BAFG cannot be ruled out. As documented in this
work, the geochemical signatures of the Mértola and Mira sediments in-
dicate source area(s) dominated by granitoid composition with minor
contribution from mafic rocks. This granitoid signature could have had
origin in the predominantly acidic volcanism of the IPB. The presence
of acid and basic volcanic clasts in the greywackes also suggests a prov-
enance from the Pyrite Belt (Schermerhorn, 1971; Oliveira, 1988;
Moreno and Saez 1989, Moreno, 1993). However, previous studies de-
note the lack of evidence for large gravity sliding, olistrostomes and
slump scars rooted in the IPB, and, together with the palaeocurrents
data in the Mértola and Mira Formations (Oliveira, 1990), suggest a
limited provenance from the IPB, not enough to account for the huge
volume (more than 3 km in thickness) of the Mértola and Mira sedi-
ments. In agreement, the UCC-normalized multi-elemental patterns of
the BAFG greywackes bear continental arc/active margin signatures,
also implying limited input from intrabasinal component.

The detrital modes and geochemistry of the Brejeira Formation
sediments indicate an additional contribution from old upper conti-
nental crustal source. These data can have two alternative interpreta-
tions: i) an internal orogen source alone, or ii) with a contribution of
an external source. At present, the petrographic and geochemical data
alone are not sufficient to distinguish between the two alternatives;
however, combined with the palaeocurrents measured in the Brejeira
Formation, and with the stratigraphy of the SPD, they are more con-
sistent with the latter. In fact, the mixed mud/carbonate platform of
the SPD was involved in the flysch sedimentation only in the late
Bashkirian and Moscovian times and the palaeocurrents of the
Brejeira Formation indicate more varied directions of sediment trans-
port, with flows from NNW to SSE and from S to N (Oliveira, 1990).

It has been suggested that the IPB and the SPD were part of
the Avalonia Plate (e.g., Martinez-Catalán et al., 1997; Oliveira and
Quesada, 1998; la Rosa et al., 2002; von Raumer et al., 2003; Ribeiro
et al., 2007; Jorge et al., 2012). The collision of this plate with the west-
ern (present coordinates) margin of the OMZ (an outboard part of
Gondwanan Iberia) in late Viséan times brought to an end the volcanism
in both plates, and was followed by tectonic inversion, uplifting in the
OMZ and the development of a SW prograding trough in the Avalonia
side. Our data are compatible with the view that, until the early
Bashkirian, this trough should have received eroded sediments from
the exhumed OMZ (e.g., Precambrian gneisses, Lower Palaeozoic gran-
ites and metasediments), and from Mississippian volcanic rocks from
both sutured plates. These sources contributed, in different proportions,
to the bulk of the Mértola and Mira rocks. From early Bashkirian on-
wards the trough received a stronger contribution from the continental
crust of the Avalonia Plate as indicated by the predominantly felsic and
recycled signature of the Brejeira Formation sediments.

9. Conclusions

The greywackes from the Mértola and Mira formations show similar
modal compositions, while Brejeira greywackes are more enriched in

quartz and have lithoclasts composed mostly by sedimentary and
metasedimentary grains.

Compared to UCC values, the analyzed greywackes, with the
exception of those from the Brejeira Formation, exhibit similar MgO
concentrations and have slightly higher TiO2, Fe2O3 and MnO, with
variable depletion in CaO, Na2O and K2O and variable enrichment in
TTE (Sc, V, Cr, Ni and Co). LILE contents in greywackes are generally
lower than the UCC. Shales show a similar pattern, with generalized
slight enrichment in K2O and variable depletion in MgO (except for
the Mértola Formation), CaO and Na2O, enrichment in Rb, Ba and Cs,
and depletion in Sr.

A–CN–K diagrams and CIA and PIA values suggest that Mértola
and Mira Formations underwent moderate weathering in the source
areas, where reduced variation of both palaeoweathering indices in-
dicates steady-state weathering conditions. The youngest Brejeira
Formation shows greater CIA and PIA variation, reflecting moderate
to intense weathering as a consequence of a non-steady-state condi-
tions. High CIA and PIA values of shales from the three BAFG forma-
tions, and low ICV (b1) and K2O/Al2O3 (~0.2) ratios suggest a more
complex history of chemical weathering associated with multiple cy-
cles of sedimentary recycling. These data indicate that during Middle
Viséan to Moscovian times, weathering conditions of source area(s)
of BAFG sediments changed from moderate to intense probably as a
consequence of tectonic instability in the area.

The source area of Mértola greywackes is heterogeneous, dominated
by rocks with granitoid composition and minor mafic input. The mafic
component becomes residual in greywackes of Mira Formation, where
granitoid source predominates. Greywackes from the Brejeira Forma-
tion exhibit a clear felsic signature with significant increase in recycled
components. All analyzed shales show geochemical features compatible
with provenance areas of mostly granodioritic composition.

Petrographic analyses, geochemical signatures of major and trace
elements and multi-element tectonic discriminant diagrams suggest
a continental arc/active margin as the most prominent origin for
BAFG sediments. These data also indicate that an old upper continental
crust contributed to the sediments of the Mira and Brejeira formations,
more pronouncedly to the latter. Collectively, geochemical signatures of
three BAFG formations are compatible with provenance from the SW
border of Ossa Morena mostly, with possible contribution of an external
(Avalonian) source.

The South Portuguese Zone is one of the main geological units of 
the Variscan Iberian Massif (Fig. 1). Its faulted boundary against 
the Ossa Morena Zone in the north is marked by the Beja Acebu-
ches Ophiolite and to the south it is overlain unconformably by 
Mesozoic sedimentary rocks of the Algarve Basin (Fig. 1). The 
Beja Acebuches Ophiolite is interpreted as a remnant of the Rheic 
Ocean that separated the Euramerican South Portuguese Zone from 
the Gondwanan Ossa Morena Zone (Oliveira 1990; Quesada et al. 
1994; Oliveira &amp;amp; Quesada 1998; Oliveira et al. 2006).

The South Portuguese Zone is divided into four ‘domains’ based 
on lithology, deformation style and age. The domains trend from 
NW–SE near the coast to east–west inland and generally young 
towards the SW. These domains are, from NE to SW, the Pulo do 
Lobo Antiform, the Pyrite Belt, the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group 
and the Southwest Portugal Domain.

The Pulo do Lobo Formation crops out in the centre of the anti-
formal structure of the Pulo do Lobo Antiform. It consists of highly 
deformed phyllites and quartzites with small intercalations of 
amphibolites of mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB)-type geochemical 
affinity. Detrital zircons from the quartzites suggest a maximum 
depositional age of 438 Ma (Silurian) for the protolith of this for-
mation (Braid et al. 2011). Flysch-type successions crop out on the 
northern and southern flanks of the antiform. These rocks are dated 
palynologically as Frasnian to late Famennian (Pereira et al. 2006, 
2008). However, detrital zircons in the upper unit of the overlying 
flysch succession (the Santa Íria Formation) located on the north-
ern limb of the Pulo do Lobo Antiform in Spain give a maximum 
depositional age of Tournaisian (347 ± 5.5 Ma, Braid et al. 2011), 
compared with the late Famennian age provided by palynomorphs 
for the same unit in Portugal (Pereira et al. 2006). This suggests 
eastward progradation of flysch deposition during late Famennian 
to Tournaisian time, although this requires further investigation. 

Vitrinite reflectance (VR) of the organic matter from the flysch 
successions of the Pulo do Lobo Antiform indicates that meta-
anthracite coal rank was attained post-late Devonian (Pereira et al. 
2006).

The Pyrite Belt succession consists of phyllites and quartzites of 
the Phyllite Quartzite Group overlain by volcanic rocks and sedi-
ments of the Volcano-Sedimentary Complex, which are often min-
eralized. Palynomorphs present in the uppermost beds of the 
Phyllite Quartzite Group indicate a Late Devonian age (Pereira 
et al. 2008). The Volcano-Sedimentary Complex is dated as Late 
Devonian to late Viséan based on palynomorphs and rare conodonts 
(Boogaard 1963, 1967; Oliveira &amp;amp; Wagner Genthis 1983; Oliveira 
et al. 2004, 2005; Pereira et al. 2007, 2008). VR values from the 
Pyrite Belt in the São Domingos mine area range from 4.6 to 5.2% 
Rr, indicating a meta-anthracite coal rank (Pereira et al. 2006).

The Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group is a turbiditic sequence over 
5 km thick that progrades southwards. The flysch sequence in the 
South Portuguese Zone is divided into three formations based on 
sedimentology and age. In ascending order these are the Mértola, 
Mira and Brejeira Formations. These units are dated by ammonoid 
faunas and palynomorphs as late Viséan, Serpukhovian to early 
Bashkirian, and late Bashkirian to late Moscovian respectively 
(Oliveira et al. 1979, 1985; Korn 1997; Pereira 1999; Pereira et al. 
2007, 2008). The Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group represents the 
development of a foreland basin that formed as a result of the colli-
sion of the South Portuguese Zone and the Ossa Morena Zone, with 
associated tectonic stacking that propagated from NE to SW 
(Oliveira 1990; Silva et al. 1990; Pereira 1997, 1999). Reworked 
Cambrian to Early Devonian palynomorphs occur commonly in the 
Brejeira Formation (Pereira 1999), indicating a source area for 
these clastic sediments outside the South Portuguese Zone, as no 
rocks older than the Mid-Devonian crop out in the South Portuguese

Abstract: The Late Palaeozoic rocks of southern Portugal have a complex thermal history. Vitrinite reflec-
tance determinations from 90 samples confirm that the organic maturity of Late Palaeozoic rocks in SW 
Portugal is very high, mainly corresponding to meta-anthracite coal rank. The optic fabric of vitrinite in 
oriented coal samples from the Brejeira Formation suggests maturation under simple, non-tectonic, burial 
conditions with peak temperatures being attained prior to Variscan deformation. The lack of any increase in 
vitrinite reflectance with depth through c. 1 km of section in borehole AC-1 is not consistent with conduc-
tive heat transfer and is interpreted as the result of late synorogenic to post-orogenic advective heating. This 
heating episode generated temperatures sufficiently high to produce levels of maturity corresponding to meta-
anthracite coal rank through much of the terrane now exposed, but not high enough to result in overprinting of 
the pre-deformation optic fabric of vitrinite in the thin coals. The slightly lower maturity of older, platform-
facies rocks in the Aljezur–Bordeira area may reflect either deposition on a basement high followed by less 
burial than adjacent parts of the basin, or the area being the site of a sink for descending relatively cool fluids.

Zone. McCormack et al. (2007) published a comprehensive study 
of the thermal history of the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group, deter-
mining a mean VR of 4.28% Rr for this domain and suggesting that 
the timing of maturation was post-Variscan deformation, within the 
late Carboniferous–late Triassic interval.

The Southwest Portugal Domain succession comprises Late 
Devonian quartzites and shales (Tercenas Formation) followed by 
a mud-dominated carbonate platform sequence, the Carrapateira 
Group, of Tournaisian to late Bashkirian age (Pereira 1999). A few 
samples from the Tercenas Formation and from the Viséan 
Murração Formation indicate maturation levels of c. 3.2% Rr 
(McCormack 1998; McCormack et al. 2007), which are lower than 
the mean maturation value of c. 4.83% Rr for the younger Brejeira 
Formation of the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group. An inversion of 
the VR values in these strata in the SWP was also described by 
Moço et al. (1998), with the highest values being recorded in the 
Brejeira Formation (4.5% Rr) and lower values being recorded in 
the older units of the Carrapateira Group (2.5–4% Rr).

Diagenetic and metamorphic conditions within the South 
Portuguese Zone have also been studied by means of clay mineral 
crystallinity (Munhá 1983, 1990; McCormack 1998; Abad et al. 
2001). These studies show a decrease in crystallinity from epizone 
conditions in the NE to the late diagenetic zone in the SW. The 
Pulo do Lobo Formation in the core of the Pulo do Lobo Antiform 
is of greenschist facies, whereas the clastic units in both limbs 
attained epizone facies.

Materials and methods

The samples analysed in this study were obtained from outcrops 
and a mineral exploration borehole (AC-1). Black and grey shales 
were the main lithologies sampled for maturation studies. A few 
thin coal lenses in fine-grained turbiditic beds in the Brejeira 
Formation were also sampled.

The dispersed organic matter in all of the Baixo Altentejo Flysch 
Group mudrocks studied is dominated by amorphous organic mat-
ter and phytoclasts (vitrinite and inertinite). Framboidal pyrite 
always appears as inclusions, normally associated with amorphous 
organic matter (AOM). Inertinite is an important constituent of the 
dispersed organic matter in some samples, although it is always 
less abundant than vitrinite.

The composition of the organic matter in the Southwest Portugal 
Domain mudrocks varies greatly between formations. AOM is the 
dominant constituent in the Quebradas and Bordalete formations. 
Vitrinite and inertinite are important constituents of the dispersed 
organic matter in the sandstone-dominated interval at the top of the 
Tercenas Formation. In the Murração Formation, organic matter is 
scarce and is dominated by inertinite and AOM.

Borehole AC-1

Borehole AC-1 was drilled by Billiton Portugal Lta. in 1986 for 
mineral exploration. It reached a depth of c. 980 m (1064 m with

inclination corrected to vertical). The upper c. 600 m consists of inter-
bedded shales and greywackes of the Mértola Formation. Below 
600 m, the succession comprises shales and fine and coarse volcani-
clastic rocks of the Volcano-Sedimentary Complex of the Iberian 
Pyrite Belt. The Mértola Formation section was extensively sampled, 
with shale samples taken at an average spacing of 20 m. Only six 
samples were taken from grey shales in the Volcano-Sedimentary 
Complex, the lowest from 729.5 m. The Mértola Formation is assigned 
to the NM Miospore Biozone, of mid-late Viséan age. Moderately 
well-preserved specimens of Raistrickia nigra, a key species of the 
miospore biozone are present. Samples from the Volcano-Sedimentary 
Complex did not provide any stratigraphically useful information.

The structural interpretation of borehole AC-1 suggests that no 
major fractures were intersected. Rocks of the Mértola Formation 
and the Volcano-Sedimentary Complex are, generally, subhori-
zontal or dipping gently to the SW, suggesting a non-faulted con-
tact between the two units (Fig. 2). The faults penetrated were 
considered to be late reverse faults, with correlation of beds across 

the faults suggesting very limited displacements (Fig. 2). Tectonic 
cleavage was also observed in the shaly intervals, dipping 30–40° 
to the NE. Structural analysis of the data suggests that the borehole 
penetrated the normal limb of a regional anticline. These structural 
features are typical of the southern branch of the Iberian Pyrite 
Belt, which is characterized by rooted folds (Silva et al. 1990).

Outcrop samples

VR was determined from 54 shale and two coal samples from out-
crops in the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group and Southwest Portugal 
Domain to determine the regional maturity and to elucidate the 
thermal evolution of the South Portuguese Zone.

At Pedras das Ameias, at the western end of the Arrifana harbour 
section (Fig. 3), interbedded greywackes and shales of the Brejeira 
Formation include occasional very thin (&lt;1 cm) coal lenses. The 
section is dominated by numerous NW–SE-trending folds from 
which field-oriented coal samples were taken on both vertical and 
subhorizontal limbs.

Extraction techniques and methods of study

Organic particles were extracted from the rock samples using 
standard cold hydrofluoric acid (HF) techniques. The organic resi-
dues obtained were then mounted and polished using a method 
adopted from that described by Hillier &amp;amp; Marshall (1988).

Mean random vitrinite reflectance (%Rr) was the VR parameter 
chosen for maturation assessment of shales because the mounting 
technique used provides non-oriented vitrinite particles and also 
because %Rr is the most widely used organic maturation parameter. 
VR measurements on most of the samples were made using an 
Olympus BX 51 microscope equipped with a black and white digital 
camera. The black and white (8-bit) digital images of vitrinite parti-
cles were analysed using a MatLab routine. This routine is a graphi-
cal tool that runs within the Mirone suite (Luis 2007) and calibrates 
the scale of 256 grey levels with standards of known reflectivity 
(Fernandes et al. 2010). The reflectance values of the standards used 
were 0.428, 0.595, 1.715, 3.150 and 5.370%. VR was measured in 
incident light with a wavelength of 546 nm and immersion oil with 
a refractive index of 1.518. Reflectances of the oriented coal sam-
ples from Pedras das Ameias were measured using the techniques 
and equipment described by McCormack et al. (1998).

Vitrinite reflectance results

Figure 1 shows the new VR results from outcrop samples together 
with results from McCormack et al. (2007). Results from borehole 
AC-1 are shown in Figure 2. The Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group rocks 
cropping out in the South Portuguese Zone do not display great vari-
ability in VR, with Rr ranging from 3.80 to 5.55%. The majority of VR 
values range from 4.0 to 5.0% Rr, corresponding to meta-anthracite 
coal rank. There is no clear correlation between the Rr means in the 
three formations investigated. This is even more marked if peak palae-
otemperatures calculated by Barker &amp;amp; Goldstein’s (1990) empirical 
equations are compared, with a difference of less than 10 °C between 
the mean peak palaeotemperature for the three formations (Table 1). 
The mean peak palaeotemperatures for the Mértola, Mira and Brejeira 
formations are 311, 302 and 310 °C respectively. The palaeotempera-
tures do not show any consistent change, in relation to stratigraphic 
position within the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group.

The geographical distribution of Rr values for the rocks of the 
Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group suggests that there is not a clear 
depocentre for this unit. This is consistent with the synsedimen-
tary tectonic model proposed by Oliveira (1990) for the South

Portuguese Zone, with progradation to the SW of the turbiditic 
sedimentation in response to thrusting and tectonic stacking to 
the north.

VR values in borehole AC-1 do not show a clear increase with 
depth through c. 700 m of section; the best-fit line is more or less 
vertical (Fig. 2). The lack of downhole increase in VR in the bore-
hole precludes the calculation of a meaningful regional palaeogeo-
thermal gradient in the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group.

For optic fabric determination of the coal lenses at Pedra das 
Ameias (Fig. 3), three orthogonal faces were cut and polished on 
each sample; (a) parallel to bedding; (b) perpendicular to bedding 
and parallel to strike; (c) perpendicular to bedding and parallel to 
dip. Measurements made on these three surfaces revealed uniaxial 
negative vitrinite reflectance indicatrices (VRIs) with maximum 
reflectance (Rmax) parallel to bedding and minimum reflectance 
(Rmin) perpendicular to bedding, even where the dip was close to 
vertical (85°). In the case of a vertical coal lens investigated, Rmax is 
6.29%, Rmin (b) is 3.72% and Rmin (c) is 3.83%.

The results from the oriented coal samples support the interpre-
tation published by McCormack et al. (2007), but are more con-
vincing as they are based on a more extreme range of dips.  
The uniaxial negative VRIs recorded are ‘typical of coalification  
in tectonically undeformed subsiding basins’ (Taylor et al. 1998; 
after Levine &amp;amp; Davis 1989). There is no trace of later modification 
producing biaxial positive or negative VRIs that would indicate 
further coalification during intense or even incipient tectonism. 

Further coalification during a post-tectonic vertical loading regime 
(i.e. post-Variscan burial of the section) might be expected to result 
in complete or partial rotation of the VRIs in the vertical limbs to a 
position where Rmax is horizontal but this was not observed. The 
implication of this evidence is that maximum temperatures were 
attained prior to initiation of deformation.

The organic maturation of the Southwest Portugal Domain has 
not been as comprehensively studied as the Baixo Altentejo Flysch 
Group. The VR measurements from SW Portugal are from rocks 
cropping out in the Aljezur and Bordeira inliers. Here, the 
Famennian Tercenas Formation has a mean of 3.37% Rr, the 
Tournaisian Bordalete Formation a mean of 3.26% Rr, the Viséan 
Murração Formation 4.34% Rr and the Serpukhovian to Bashkirian 
Quebradas Formation a mean of 3.52% Rr. With the exception of 
the Murração Formation, the VR values measured for the Southwest 
Portugal Domain are in general 1% Rr lower than the average  
values of the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group rocks of the same age 
(Table 1). Although VR suppression could be invoked to explain 
the low values obtained from the predominantly shaly Quebradas 
Formation, this is most unlikely at such high levels of maturity and 
the same mechanism cannot be applied to the other coarser-grained 
formations. More likely explanations for the low Rr values observed 
are that either the platform-facies sediments of the Aljezur–
Bordeira area were a ‘sink’ for descending, relatively cool fluids, or 
that this area was situated on a persistent basement high and was 
less deeply buried than adjacent areas.

Thermal history

High maturity in Western European Late Palaeozoic rocks has been 
noted by several researchers. For example, Cornford et al. (1987), 
described VR in the Culm Basin of SW England ranging from 4.4 
to 5.6%. Those workers attributed the high values to a combination 
of several factors: burial, Variscan thrusting and the emplacement 
of the Dartmoor Granite. The Culm succession of turbidites and 
subsidiary black shales is closely comparable in age, facies and 
maturity with the Mira and Brejeira formations in SW Portugal 
(Oliveira &amp;amp; Quesada 1998). Hower &amp;amp; Gayer (2002) drew attention 

to the importance of advective heating in Palaeozoic foreland 
basins, based on four case studies from the USA, South Wales and 
Australia. A model that is consistent with our results in SW Portugal 
is discussed below and illustrated in Figure 4.

Pre-Variscan

Our data suggest that the attainment of peak temperatures during 
late Pennsylvanian time was the consequence of simple, pre- 
tectonic burial. The high maturity of rocks towards the top of the 
Pennsylvanian succession (Table 1) necessitates a high geothermal

the tectonic and thermal evolution of 
the Late Palaeozoic rocks of the South 
Portuguese Zone. Figures not to scale.  
(a) Late Viséan. Rapid subsidence (&gt;2 km) 
and start of turbiditic deposition (Mértola 
Formation). Early Variscan thrusting in the 
north involves the Pulo do Lobo and Pyrite 
Belt. Deposition of muds and limestones 
(Murração Formation) on the distal part 
of a carbonate platform in Southwest 
Portugal Domain. (b) Serpukhovian–early 
Bashkirian. Deposition of the Mira 
Formation; continuing rapid subsidence. 
Thrusting continues in the north and 
propagates southwards. Deposition of  
muds in anoxic environments in SW 
Portugal Sector (Quebradas Formation).  
(c) Late Bashkirian–Moscovian. Deposition 
of the Brejeira Formation, which progrades 
southwards and onlaps onto the platform-
facies rocks in the Southwest Portugal 
Domain. Thrusting continues in the north 
and starts to involve the Mértola and 
Mira Formations. Increasing topographic 
relief owing to thrust sheet stacking 
initiates advective heating, which becomes 
the main mechanism for heat transfer. 
Enhanced burial maturation at relatively 
shallow depth in the south caused by high 
geothermal gradient. (d) Kasimovian/
Gzhelian–Early Permian. End of main phase 
of Variscan deformation and maximum 
relief of mountain ranges. Advective heating 
homogenizes temperatures across the entire 
South Portuguese Zone.

THERMAL HISTORY OF THE SOUTH PORTUGUESE ZONE 653

gradient at this time in view of the limited thickness of cover sec-
tion available at this time.

Based on geophysical evidence, Simancas et al. (2006) sug-
gested that magma trapped in the mid-crust within the Iberian 
Variscides produced high geothermal gradients and postulated the 
development of a mantle plume in early Carboniferous time. 
Doblas et al. (1998) also inferred the existence of a pan-European 
mantle plume but based this on the geochemistry of volcanic rocks 
and suggested that this was a later (latest Carboniferous–early 
Permian) event. However, if the advective fluid flow system 
described below was operative in late Carboniferous time, it could 
have produced a sufficiently high geothermal gradient to explain 
the observed maturity of the Late Palaeozoic units in SW Portugal, 
obviating the need for any mantle plume.

Variscan

Temperatures remained high but did not exceed the maximum 
attained before Variscan deformation. The evidence for this is the 
optic fabric determined from the oriented coal samples from 
Arrifana. Advective heating by hot fluids expelled during 
Variscan folding and thrusting produced relatively uniform high 
temperatures in the upper crust, overprinting any existing vertical 
VR gradient.

In the Brejeira Formation (incorrectly identified by Zulauf et al. 
2011 as the Mértola Formation), fluid inclusions from vertical and 
horizontal veins genetically related to Variscan folding indicate 
peak temperatures of 200 ± 20 °C for vertical veins and 230 ± 22 °C 
for horizontal veins. Palaeotemperatures calculated from VR in 
the present study are in the range of 276–325 °C with mean 304 °C 
in the Baixo Altentejo Flysch Group (Table 1), supporting our 
contention that peak temperatures were achieved prior to Variscan 
deformation but still remained high during and after deformation.

Post-Variscan

Evidence for high temperatures having been maintained for 
some time after deformation is provided by the similarity of VR 
in Carboniferous rocks at the surface throughout SW Portugal, 
regardless of their stratigraphic age. In borehole AC-1, the lack 
of any downhole increase in VR through c. 700 m of section is 
not consistent with conductive heating in a ‘normal’ burial mat-
uration regime but suggests advective heat transfer. Based on 
hydrogeological modelling, Gayer et al. (1998) attributed the 
anthracite rank of parts of the South Wales Coalfield to ‘topo-
graphically driven fluid flow systems that developed soon after 
the climax of the Variscan orogeny’. Those workers also sug-
gested a very short (1–2 Ma) duration for the flow system after 
maximum uplift.

We suggest that a similar fluid flow regime in the Late Palaeozoic 
units of SW Portugal was established, driven by thrusting and tec-
tonic stacking to the north in the Pulo do Lobo Antiform and the 
northern branch of the Pyrite Belt (Silva et al. 1990). The anoma-
lously low maturity of platform-facies rocks in the Aljezur–
Bordeira antiforms may be a consequence of this area having been 
a ‘sink’ for descending, relatively cool fluids.

Variscan deformation was clearly followed by uplift and erosion 
but the timing of this is poorly constrained. Late Triassic sediments 
and volcanic rocks unconformably overlie deformed and highly 
mature Devonian and Carboniferous strata throughout SW Portugal. 
The much lower maturity of the Triassic units (c. 1.1% Rr) is due to 
Mesozoic burial (McCormack et al. 2007). Mesozoic re-burial of the 
already highly mature Late Palaeozoic rocks did not elevate their 
temperatures sufficiently to further increase their maturity.

Conclusions

The organic maturity of the Late Palaeozoic rocks of SW Portugal is 
very high, mainly corresponding to meta-anthracite coal rank. The 
slightly lower maturity of older, platform-facies rocks in the Aljezur–
Bordeira antiforms resulted either from this area having been a sink 
for desending, relatively cold fluids or from less burial than adjacent 
parts of the basin. The optic fabric of vitrinite in oriented coal sam-
ples from the Brejeira Formation indicates maturation under simple, 
non-tectonic burial conditions; that is, peak temperatures were 
attained prior to Variscan deformation. The high maturity of samples 
from close to the top of the preserved Pennsylvanian (Moscovian) 
section suggests an anomalously high late Carboniferous geothermal 
gradient. The lack of any increase in VR through c. 700 m of section 
in borehole AC-1 is not consistent with conductive heat transfer but 
suggests advective heating. Mesozoic re-burial of the Late Palaeozoic 
rocks had no effect on their already high maturity.

The geochemical signature of sediments is currently used 

as trace evidence in forensic investigations. In this research, 
geochemical studies have been carried out on Portuguese 
coastal sands aiming to ascertain its use for forensic purposes.  

Rare Earth Elements (REE) concentrations were 
determined on samples collected on three coastal areas 
surrounded by different geological contexts, namely 
limestone, granite and metasediment. Eight sand samples were 
collected along transects perpendicular to the coastline, in 
beach and dune from each site. Each sample was manually 
collected with a plastic spade from the surface sediment, at a 
depth of approximately 0-5cm. From the sediment samples a 
standardized particle size fraction of&amp;lt;150 µm was obtained 
by dry sieving method and subsequently grinded to minimise 
the variation in the geochemical properties due to particle size.  

The REE composition fraction was determined using four 
acid digestions ultratrace ICP-MS analysis at ACME labs 
(Canada), and concentrations calculated. Although the 
measured REEs concentrations can be compared directly for 
forensic purposes a normalisation reported to condrite 
meteorites was performed [1]. 

A REEs normalised concentration and a hierarchical 
cluster analyses were performed to obtain discrimination 
between samples. They reveal differences between samples 
associated with different geological context, and permitted the 
discrimination between samples surrounded by granite from 
samples surrounded by limestone and metasediments. It was 
also possible to discriminate some of the samples based on 
their REE concentration and profile.

Microprobe analyses were made to infer the source of 
detrital tourmalines from the Mid to Late Carboniferous 
turbiditic deposits of the Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group 
(BAFG) of the South Portuguese Zone. A representative group 
of greywacke samples covering the whole range of the BAFG 
ages was collected for this study. Tourmalines have brown to 
brownish gray colors and do not show any optical zonation. In 
the Fe-Mg-Al diagram, the tourmalines fall into the fields of 
Ca-poor metapelites, metapsammites and quartz-tourmaline 
rocks. Microprobe analyses revealed a range of values 
between schorl and dravite end members, being closer to the 
latter, with variable contents of X-site vacancies (0.05-0.255 
apfu), Ca (0.078-0.2 apfu), Na (0.627-0.924 and Al (5.746-
6.622 apfu). The Fe/(Fe+Mg) and Na/(Na+Ca) ratios range 
from 0.32-0.45 and 0.79-0.91, respectively. 

The presence of well-rounded tourmaline grains suggests 
that they could have derived from a source located at a great 
distance from the sedimentary basin, or from reworked 
sedimentary rocks. The occurrence of few euhedral grains 
indicates minor contribution from first cycle sediments. 
Together, these data suggest that the detrital BAFG 
tourmalines derived from multiple sources with the 
predominance of rocks with a felsic composition.
