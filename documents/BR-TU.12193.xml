Abstract

The manganese lump ore from Morro da Mina mine is typically silicate car-
bonated and presents a great economic potential for the ferroalloy companies in-
stalled in Minas Gerais. However, its low manganese content, associated with the 
lack of knowledge about its metallurgical properties makes it difficult for large scale 
application. This pioneering study aimed to amply investigate this lump ore’s par-
ticle disintegration. One ton of ore from the mine was homogenized and quartered. 
Representative samples were characterized by different techniques, such as ICP-AES, 
XRD, SEM, BET and OM. Aiming to characterize particle disintegration, three pa-
rameters were proposed: Cold Disintegration Index (CDI), Decrepitation Index (DI) 
and Heating Disintegration Index (HDI). By using these indexes, it was possible to 
conclude that this manganese lump ore did not present significant disintegration at 
room temperature. At medium temperature test, slight decrepitation occurred, and 
at high temperatures, intense disintegration was detected. The carbonate decomposi-
tion and porosity growth were the main responsible factors for the ore hot particle 
disintegration.

Resumo

O Produto Granulado de Morro da Mina é um minério de manganês silicatado car-
bonatado que apresenta grande potencial econômico para as empresas de ferro ligas insta-
ladas em Minas Gerais. Entretanto o baixo teor de manganês e o pouco conhecimento a 
respeito de suas propriedades metalúrgicas dificultam a sua aplicação. Esse trabalho, pio-
neiramente, propõe um estudo a respeito da degradação granulométrica das  suas partícu-
las a frio e a quente. Uma tonelada do material foi recebida, homogeneizada e quarteada. 
Amostras representativas foram caracterizadas pelas técnicas de ICP-AES, DRX, MEV-
EDS, BET e MO.  Foram propostos três parâmetros para a caracterização da degradação: 
índice de desintegração granulométrica a frio (DGF), o índice de crepitação (IC) e o índice 
de desintegração granulométrica a quente (DGQ). Por meio deles, foi possível observar que 
o Granulado de Morro da Mina não apresenta significativa degradação granulométrica 
por crepitação, entretanto apresenta uma intensa degradação após ser submetido a ciclos 
térmicos de calcinação e de pré-redução, não existindo significativas diferenças entre os 
dois. A decomposição térmica dos carbonatos de manganês e o consequente aumento da 
porosidade são os principais fatores responsáveis pela desintegração do minério.

Particle disintegration of an important brazilian manganese lump ore

REM: R. Esc. Minas, Ouro Preto, 67(1), 55-60, jan. mar. | 2014

1. Introduction

The electric reduction furnace is the 
one most used in the manganese ferroal-
loy production around the world. One of 
the most important parts of the reduction 
process is the pre-reduction zone, where 
the solid raw materials are heated by the 
heat exchange with the hot gases flowing 
upward. On the furnace top, the moisture 
and structural water are evaporated and a 
part of the manganese oxides are decom-
posed by the ascendant gases. Only if the 
furnace charge has a high permeability 
will the water be adequately evaporated 
and the oxides pre-reduced [Tangstad 
et al (2004), Olsen et al (2007), Faria 
(2008), Faria et al (2010), Faria (2011), 
Faria et al (2011), Faria et al (2012)].

In this context, the ore particle 
disintegration is an important metallur-
gical parameter which has not yet been 
well studied for manganese lump ores. 
The breakage of ore particles as they 

are heated in the furnace may produce a 
big amount of fines and diminishes the 
charge permeability.  The low gas flux 
will not heat the charge adequately and 
the oxides will not be completely pre-
reduced. This scenario will be respon-
sible for a top gas at high temperatures 
and with a high CO content. Therefore, 
the use of manganese ore mixtures with 
high fine generation susceptibility may 
decrease the heat exchange efficiency and 
be a problem for the furnace operation 
and productivity [Faria (2011), Faria et 
al (2011), Tangstad et al (2004), Olsen 
et al (2007)].          

In technical literature, only three 
papers about manganese ore disintegra-
tion were found. Yoshikoshi et al (1983) 
and Tangstad et al (2004) studied man-
ganese ore fine generation by tumbling 
tests. The authors concluded that the 
more porous the ore, the lower its me-

chanical strength. However, they did not 
correlate their observations to the ore 
mineralogy. Faria et al (2012) studied the 
decrepitation behavior of three Brazilian 
manganese ores. The author showed that 
the evaporation of structural water and 
the oxide pre-reduction were the main 
causes for the decrepitation phenomenon 
in manganese ores.   

 Having in mind the strategic 
and logistic importance of Morro da 
Mina Mine, associated with the lack of 
knowledge about its ore disintegration 
behavior, this pioneering study proposed 
an experimental method that allowed the 
characterization of this important metal-
lurgical parameter. The data generated 
and good industrial planning may be 
important for the definition of technical 
criteria that may guide the selection of ore 
mixtures, aiming to improve the process 
control and functionality.    

2. Materials and methods

A ton of the studied lump ore was ho-
mogenized and quartered. Two representa-
tive samples were screened and two particle 
sizes were collected: 1) between 15.9mm 

and 9.5mm; 2) between 19mm and 6.3mm. 
These particle sizes were characterized. 

The Mn, Fe, CaO, MgO, SiO

TiO

 and P contents were determined by 

ICP-OES and titration. The mineralogical 
characterization was performed by XRD 
(1.2o/minute – Cu source), optical micros-
copy and thermogravimetry. 

The first proposed index allowed for 
the characterization of the particle disinte-
gration at room temperature. This index 
measured the ore’s mechanical strength 
under abrasion and impact procedures. 
This index was defined as Cold Disinte-
gration Index (CDI). Aiming to determine 
the CDI, the particle size between 15.9mm 
and 9.5mm were dried and tumbled 
(3x10minutes) in a rotative tumbler 
AN4696TR standardized by ISO9246-1 
and ISO9246-2. The percentage weight 
of fines generated below 9.5mm, 6.3mm, 
3.35mm, 1.18mm, 0.6mm and 100# sieves 
were defined as the CDI.  

Two parameters were defined aim-
ing to evaluate the mechanical behavior 
of the heated ores. The first index was 
proposed aiming to simulate the top of the 
electric furnace. This index was defined 
as Decrepitation Index (DI). The particle 
sizes between 19mm and 6.3mm were in-

troduced into a pre-heated oven (700oC). 
The residence time was 30 minutes. After, 
the samples were cooled naturally at room 
temperature and screened at 6.3mm, 
3.35mm, 1.18mm and 0.5mm mesh. Ten 
tests were performed and the average 
weight percentage below each sieve was 
defined as DI. Two extra conditions were 
analyzed: decrepitation of the wet sample 
(without drying procedure) and decrepita-
tion of samples heated under reducing gas 
flux [1.5NL/min of H2 (6%), CO2 (38%) 
and CO (56%) – similar to the constitution 
of the furnace top gas].

 The second index was proposed to 
simulate the ore mechanical behavior in 
the pre-reduction zone, where the samples 
were heated in constant contact with 
a strong reducing gas. This index was 
defined as Heating Disintegration Index 
(HDI). The particle sizes between 15.9mm 
and 6.3mm were dried and sampled in 

amounts of 500g. Each sample was heated 
(25oC/min) in a crucible standardized 
by ISO4696-1and ISO4696-2 under 
continuous flux of 5NL/min N2 (100%) 
until 1000oC. After, the nitrogen flux was 
interrupted and a flux of CO (99.5%) and 
N2 (0.5%) were established (Three condi-
tions were tested: 2NL/min, 5NL/min and 
15NL/min) and the residence time was 
one hour. Aiming to build a reference, 
one test was done with only N2 (100%).

The samples were cooled under a 
5NL/min N2 (100%) flux until room tem-
perature. They were screened at 9.5mm, 
6.3mm, 3.35mm, 1.18mm, 0,6mm and 
100#. The samples were recomposed and 
submitted to tumbling procedures in an 
AN4696TR tumbler with a frequency of 
30rpm (10 minutes, 20 minutes and 30 
minutes). The HDI was defined as the av-
erage weight percentage below each sieve 
(tests were done twice).

3. Results and discussions

3.1. Chemical and Mineralogical Characterization

Table 2 presents the chemical composition for each particle size from Morro da Mina’s lump ore.

Table 2
 Chemical analysis of Morro da Mina’s 
lump ore (studied particle sizes).

The studied particle sizes presented 
low manganese contents. The particle sizes 
between 15.9mm and 9.5mm were the rich-

est. These manganese contents as well as the 
high SiO

2 
contents, can be justified by the 

ore’s mineralogical constitution presented 

in Table 3. Both particle sizes are mainly 
constituted by rhodochrosite [MnCO

3
] and 

spessartite [Mn3Al
2
(SiO

4
)
3
].

Mina’s ore (studied particle sizes).

3.2. Particle Disintegration

The CDI indexes and their standard 
deviations are presented in Figure 1. For the 
studied tumbling conditions, the Morro da 
Mina’s lump ore presented low susceptibility 
to the cold fines generation. This ore present-
ed only 0.7% of material below 6.3mm mesh 
after 30 minutes of the tumbling process. 

Figure 2 presents the decrepitation 
indexes for the three studied conditions. The 
studied ore also presented low susceptibility 

to the decrepitation phenomenon for all 
conditions. The fines generation was more 
significant in the reducing atmosphere.

According to Faria’s researches (be-
tween 2008 and 2011)(1,5), oxidized ores, 
different from the lump ore studied herein,  
have high decrepitation indexes. According 
to him, the structural water evaporation and 
the oxide heat decompositions are the main 
causes for this phenomenon.  

The Morro da Mina’s lump ore 
consists mainly of carbonates and silicates 
which are thermodynamically stable at 
700oC (decrepitation test temperature). This 
characteristic coupled with the low content 
of hydrated minerals is responsible for the 
structural integrity maintenance during the 
fast heating of the ore until the decrepitation 
test temperature, justifying the small amount 
of fines generated.

Figure 6
Comparison between the CDI and HDI 
indexes measured by a 0.6mm sieve.

Between 300ºC and 600ºC, the 
structural water present in some amphi-
boles was evaporated and a low weight loss 
was observed. The rhodochrosite (manga-
nese carbonate) started its decomposition 
around 700oC. The weight loss of 12% 
indicates that during the ore heating, all 
rhodochrosite was decomposed in MnO. 
Due to the happening of the decomposition 
reaction under natural air, no differences 
were found between the tests done under 
air or reducing gas flux.  

This ore presented high susceptibil-
ity to the fines generation during heating 
decomposition. During the sample heating 
until 1000oC under continuous air flux, 
10% of the material falls below 6.3mm 
mesh and 7% falls below 0.6mm mesh. 

After 30 minutes of tumbling, 24% of the 
material falls below 6.3mm mesh and 16% 
falls below 0.6mm mesh. These results 
indicate the low mechanical resistance of 
the heat decomposed ore. 

The disintegration of this ore during 
heat decomposition under an oxidizing 
atmosphere (air) may be associated with 
rhodochrosite’s heat decomposition, which 
increases particle porosity and changes the 
particle surface shape. Some small crystals 
of espessartite, initially coupled to the 
rhodochrosite, lose their fixation, being 
freed in very small particles. The progres-
sive HDI index growth in function of the 
tumbling time was associated with the 
espessartite small crystal’s presence, which 
is a hard silicate that works as an abrasive.

Figure 7 compares total porosities 
between the natural and heat treated 
samples. As in the previously mentioned 
hypotheses, the heat decomposed samples 
present the highest total porosities, jus-
tifying the ore’s decreasing mechanical 
resistance.   

Figure 8 presents the comparison 
between natural and heat treated particles. 
It was possible to observe that granades, 
characterized for their spherical crystal 
shape, continue stable in the ore structure 
after heat decomposition and pre-reducing. 
However the amount of rhodochrosite 
crystals that occupied spaces between 
granades decreased, leaving empty places 
and increasing particle porosity, while 
decreasing the ore’s mechanical resistance.

4. Conclusions

1. The lump ore from Morro da 
Mina mine had low manganese content 
in comparison to the oxidized ores and 
an intermediary Mn/Fe ratio. These 
characteristics, associated with the high 
SiO2, Al2O3 and CaO contents, may be 
responsible for a low metal/slag ratio, 
which may produce a highly reactive 
basic slag. 

2. The studied ore mainly con-
sisted of silicates (spessartite and teph-
roite) and of one manganese carbonate 
(rhodochrosite). According to the ore 
constitution, it is possible to classify it 

as silicate carbonated ore.
3. The proposed indexes (CDI 

– Cold Disintegration Index, DI – De-
crepitation Index, and HDI – Heating 
Disintegration Index) are efficient for 
the quantitative characterization of the 
studied ore particle disintegration.

 4. This ore has low susceptibil-
ity to cold particle disintegration and 
to the decrepitation phenomena.  The 
moisture and the reducing atmosphere 
were not influents on decrepitation 
phenomenon. 

5. The ore produced a big amount 

of fines during heat decomposition and 
pre-reduction at 1000oC. No significant 
differences were observed between the 
tests with different gas flow rates [2Nl/
min, 5Nl/min and 15Nl/min of CO 
(99.5%) and  N2 (0.5%)]. 

6. The rhodochrosite heat decom-
position is the main factor responsible 
for the ore particle disintegration. From 
all the fines below 6.3mm, 75% of them 
passed through a 0.6mm mesh sieve. 
This result shows that Morro da Mina’s 
lump ore when heat decomposed has a 
low abrasion resistance.
