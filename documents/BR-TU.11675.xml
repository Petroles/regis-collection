resumo 
 

 

Nos últimos anos temos assistido à procura de produtos amigos do ambiente. 
Um dos maiores desafios tem sido a procura de materiais biodegradáveis que 
possam substituir materiais vulgarmente designados por “plástico”. Se há 
dezenas de anos o plástico veio, por exemplo, substituir o marfim nas bolas de 
bilhar, salvando vidas de milhares de elefantes, hoje, procuramos um 
substituto para esse plástico, de forma a preservar as condições ambientais 
que nos permitem viver harmoniosamente com a restante fauna e flora, e que 
a espécie humana tem, nos últimos anos, vindo a destruir. O plástico é um 
derivado do petróleo, cujo preço tem vindo a crescer exponencialmente, devido 
ao facto de ser barato e possuir propriedades que permitem desenhar produtos 
essenciais à vida quotidiana. Por isso, precisamos de sair da era petroquímica 
e entrar numa nova era ambientalmente sustentável, baseada em materiais 
biodegradáveis provenientes de fontes renováveis. Esta mudança para rotas 
“verdes”, só será possível com o apoio de grandes empresas, e medidas 
governamentais drásticas. O poliácido láctico, PLA,  produzido a partir da 
lactose presente no amido ou no açúcar, tem sido intensivamente estudado 
nos últimos anos e possui potencial para substituir os tradicionais polímeros 
derivados do petróleo, se forem melhoradas algumas propriedades 
necessárias ao processamento por extrusão. O PLA, é muito frágil, pouco 
resistente e pouco flexível. Neste trabalho foram adicionados antioxidantes 
naturais (alfa-tocoferol) e sintéticos (BHT e TBHQ) ao PLA com o objetivo não 
só de melhorar as suas propriedades mecânicas, mas também de criar uma 
embalagem ativa que prolongue o prazo de validade dos alimentos e melhore 
as suas propriedades organoléticas prevenindo alterações ou perda de sabor. 
O impacto da adição destes  antioxidantes nas propriedades originais do PLA 
a nível mecânico, térmico e de barreira foi estudado pela utilização das 
técnicas de FTIR, DSC, SEM, AFM, DMA, TGA, QCM e time-lag.

abstract 

 
In recent years, the search for a environmentally friendly products has 
increased. One of the major challenges has been the demand for 
biodegradable materials that can replace plastic. If a few decades ago, plastic 
replaced, for example, the ivory in billiard balls, and in other products, saving 
the lives of thousands elephants, nowadays a replacement for that plastic is 
being searched, to prevent the change of the environmental conditions, 
essential to life in harmonly with the fauna and flora that the human specie has, 
in recent years, destroyed. Plastic is a petroleum derivate, whose price has 
been growing exponentially, mainly due to the fact of beind a cheap material 
and also to enable the production of products that are essential to modern life. 
Therefore, the petrochemical era is going to come to an end and a new 
environmentally sustainable era, based on biodegradable materials from 
renewable sources, will follow. The change to green routes only will be possible 
with the support of the major companies, and the implementation of drastic 
governmental law.  
Poly(lactic acid), PLA, is produced from the lactose present in the corn or 
sugarcane and has been intensively studied in recent years because if some 
limitants properties required its extrusion are overcome, it has the potential to 
replace the traditional polymers. PLA have high brittleness, low toughness and 
low tensile elongation. In this work, natural antioxidant (alpha-tocopherol) and 
synthetics antioxidants (BHT ant TBHQ) were added to the PLA with the aim 
not only to improve their flexibility, but also to create an active packaging to 
extend the shelf life of the foods and improve the organoleptic properties by 
preventing food losses. The impact of the addition of antioxidants into the PLA 
films, in its mechanical, thermal and barrier properties were studied by FTIR, 
DSC, SEM, AFM, DMA, TGA, QCM and time-lag techniques.

1.1. Context 
 

Since their pioneering days over a hundred years ago, plastics have greatly 

improved human living conditions and are indispensable and irreplaceable in modern 

everyday life. As a result of their resource, efficient production processes, facile 

processing, and high versatility in terms of tunable properties and broad range of 

applications, these materials render high technologies affordable for all humankind.
1
 

Plastics are versatile materials potentially indestructible, ideal for a number of commercial 

and domestic applications. Every day thousands of tones of plastic are used and disposed 

in the form of disposable cups to thin cellular packing. Statistics show that about 85 % of 

these plastics are sent to landfill or dumped elsewhere.
2
 Every year in Europe, 10 million 

tones of post-consumer plastic waste are buried in landfills
3
,
 
that  are quickly reaching their 

capacities, and consequently new landfills are opened, generating great environmental threat in 

the coming years. Although plastics take long time to break down, only about 5 % of 

plastics used are currently being recycled.
2
 Plastics make our life easier and better, e.g. 

when used as packaging they can safely protect from damage and leaking and deliver a 

product unalterable from the manufacturer to the consumer, in a world where one more day 

of shelf life matters and simultaneously safety cannot be compromised. The world’s plastic 

consumption has increased incredibly in recent decades, generating more and more plastic 

waste, thus increasing the public concern.
4
 Petrochemical-based plastics such as 

Polyethylene (PE) polypropylene (PP), polyvinylchloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS) and 

polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyamide (PA) have been increasingly used as 

packaging materials due not only to their large availability at relatively low cost, but also 

to their good mechanical performance such as tensile and tear strength, good barrier to 

oxygen, carbon dioxide and aroma compound, heat sealability, and so on. 
5
 

Worldwide plastics production increased 4 % in 2011, with more than 10 million 

tons of plastics produced. Polyolefins, PP, PVC, PET and PS account for about 70 % of the 

total global demand, i.e. 200 million tons. From 2010 to 2016, global plastics consumption 

is expected to grow by an average of about 4 % each year. The world will consume 540 

million tons of plastic in 2020.
6
 Figure 1 present the estimates of worldwide production by 

2016.

During the 20
th

 century, a great variety of synthetic polymers became available at 

industrial scale. This was mainly due to the petrochemistry, a strong technology emerging 

since the 1950s. Exploitation of oil and gas as fossil raw materials for the chemical 

industry and polymer production greatly improved cost-effectiveness and simplified 

manufacturing of macromolecular materials. Since then, the attractive combination of low 

cost with facile processing and innovation represents the key feature of plastics. In the 

1990s, new recycling technologies enabled the effective reuse of polymer products that had 

completed their first lifecycle.
1
  

Polymer wastes can thus become a valuable source of raw materials and energy. In today’s 

highly efficient industrial polymerization processes, polymers are tailored to be stiff, soft 

or rubbery, conducting or insulating, optically transparent or opaque, permeable or 

impermeable, stable or (bio)degradable. Prominent examples of polymer applications 

include food and medical packaging materials, lightweight engineering plastics in the 

automotive and aerospace industries, damage-tolerant construction materials for modern 

architecture, high-strength fibers for textiles and composite materials, printed circuit 

boards and photoresists for microelectronics, solvent-free coatings for corrosion protection, 

adhesives, and new materials for biomedical applications such as wound dressing, 

membranes for artificial kidneys and water purification, dental fillings, drug delivery 

systems, artificial hearts, and implants. Plastics have become essential components of 



4 

 

virtually any kind of consumer product, meeting the highly diversified demands of human 

society.
1
 Despite the many applications that a wide diversity of plastics find in different 

sectors, the packaging industry is by far the one that shows the highest use of these 

materials, as depicted in Figure 2.
6
 

 
 

Figure 2 – European Plastics demand and its sectors of application.

Food packaging is a necessary part of exchanging goods around a country and the 

world, securing the food supply chain. The way consumers buy goods demands protection 

and preservation.
5
 In industrialized countries, polymer packaging secures the food supply 

chain, whereas in developing countries around half the food is lost in transportation.
1
 

For a long time polymers have supplied most of common packaging materials 

because they are able to present several key features like softness, lightness and 

transparency. However, increased use of synthetic packaging has led to serious ecological 

problems due to their total non-biodegradability.
5
 Figure 3 illustrates the different types of 

plastics used in the different packaging applications.

Figure 3 – Types of plastic packaging divided by type of use and type of resin.

It is widely accepted that the use of long-lasting polymers from petrochemicals in 

products with a short life-span, such as engineering applications packaging, catering, 

surgery, and hygiene, is not adequate. Persistent polymers generate significant sources of 

environmental pollution, harming wildlife when they are dispersed in nature.
8
 Moreover, 

incineration of plastic waste presents severe environmental issues since it yields toxic 

emissions (e.g., dioxins).
8
 Although their complete replacement with eco-friendly 

packaging films is just impossible to achieve, at least for specific applications, like food 

packaging, the use of bioplastics is clearly the future.
5
 

Today the world is quickly coming to realize the impact of packaging on human life. 

The world is beginning to see the effects of our existence on the planet. This has sparked a 

major movement towards maintaining society’s thirst for goods while improving the 

footprint left on our planet.
5
 The past few years, marked by the paradigm of sustainable 

development, have brought about a renewed interest in biodegradable polymers originating 

from renewable resources. The most important market for those novel polymers will be the 

packaging sector, within which food packaging represents approximately 65 % in volume.
9
   

Bio-based polymers offer important contributions by reducing the dependence on fossil 

fuels and through the related positive environmental impacts such as reduced carbon 

dioxide emissions.
10

 The first generation of bio-based polymers focused on deriving 

polymers from agricultural feedstocks such as corn, potatoes, and other carbohydrate 

feedstocks. However, the focus has shifted in recent years due to a desire to move away 

from food-based resources and also significant breakthroughs in biotechnology.
10

 Bio-



6 

 

based polymers similar to conventional polymers are produced by bacterial fermentation 

processes synthesis of the building blocks (monomers) from renewable resources, 

including lignocellulosic biomass (starch and cellulose), fatty acids, and organic waste.
10

 

Natural bio-based polymers are the other class of bio-based polymers which are found in 

nature, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides (collagen, chitosan, etc.). These 

bio-based polymers have shown enormous growth in recent years in terms of technological 

developments and their commercial applications.
10

  

The terms bio-based polymers and biodegradable polymers are used extensively in the 

literature.
10

 Biodegradable polymers are defined as materials whose physical and chemical 

properties undergo deterioration and completely degrade when exposed to microorganisms, 

carbon dioxide (aerobic) processes, methane (anaerobic processes), and water (aerobic and 

anaerobic processes).
10

 Bio-based polymers can be biodegradable (e.g., polylactic acid) or 

nondegradable (e.g., biopolyethylene). Similarly, while many bio-based polymers are 

biodegradable (e.g., starch and polyhydroxyalkanoates), not all biodegradable polymers are 

bio-based (e.g., polycaprolactone).
10

 There are three principal ways to produce bio-based 

polymers as shown in Figure 4:

Bio-based polymers hold a tiny fraction of the total global plastic market. Recent 

data show that the production of bio-based polymers should increase from 1.5 % in 2011 to 

3 % in 2020. Figure 5 shows the evolution of production capacities of bio-based 

polymers.
12

 

 

 

Figure 5 – Evolution of production capacities of bio-based polymers.
12

 

 

 

The worldwide interest in bio-based polymers has accelerated in recent years due to the 

desire and need to find non-fossil fuel-based polymers as shown in Figure 6.
10

 Several 

synthetic polymers are biodegradable and compostable like natural carbon-based polymers, 

such as starch, cellulose and lignin. In the same way some bioplastics based on natural 

monomers, can lose biodegradability through chemical modifications, like polymerization, 

such as for example Nylon 9 types polymers obtained from polymerization of oleic acid 

monomer or Polyamid 11 obtained from the polymerization  of castor oil monomer.
5
 

Synthetic and natural polymers stand at the opposite ends of a spectrum of 

properties: i) polyolefins are hydrocarbon hydrophobic polymers, resistant to peroxidation 



8 

 

and biodegradation, highly resistant to hydrolysis, which is their main attribute for the 

application in packaging. To make polyolefins biodegradable it is necessary to introduce 

pro-oxidant additives which promote the oxo-biodegradation by producing low molar mass 

oxidation compounds bioassimilable by the microorganisms; ii) natural compounds, like 

cellulose, starch and so on, are hydrophilic polymers, water wettable or swellable and 

consequently biodegradable. They are not technologically useful for food packaging where 

water resistance is required. Between these two extremes are the hydro-biodegradable 

aliphatic polyesters such as polylactic acid (PLA) and the poly(hydroxyacid) (PHA).
5
 

Among bio-source-based polymers emerging on the food market, the semi-crystalline 

polyester poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is one of the most applied.

1.2. Poly(lactic acid) 

 
Lactic acid (2-hydroxy propionic acid) is a molecular compound with a chiral carbon 

atom and exists in two enantiomeric forms (Figure 7). The lactide monomer, from which 

PLA is made of, comes from lactic acid, that has two enantiomers, L and D
13

 (Figure 7).
14

 

Control of the (L:D) monomer ratio is a very important feature in PLA, since it has a large 

effect on material properties, including the degradation time,
13

 melting temperature, degree 

of crystallinity, and barrier properties. Generally, higher L-lactide content should result in 

higher barrier properties of the polymer because of greater stereochemical purity.
15

 The L-

type is the most abundant naturally.
15

 The chiral nature of lactic acid results in distinct 

forms of polylactide, namely, poly(L-lactide) (PLLA), poly(D-lactide) (PDLA), and 

poly(DL-lactide) (PDLLA), which are synthesized from the L-, D- and DL-lactic acid 

monomers, respectively, or from the corresponding L,L-lactide, D,D-lactide, and DL-

lactide, respectively.
15

 

The future widespread availability of PLA raises interesting and important questions 

regarding its application.

Figure 7 – Chemical structure of L - and D - lactic acid and the enantiomeric forms of lactic acid: (S) - and 

(R) – 2- hydroxypropionic acid.
15

 

 

The lactic acid molecule has a hydroxyl and an acid functional group, which may 

result in intermolecular and intramolecular esterification reactions.
14

 Almost all lactic acid 

available in the market is produced by fermentation. During fermentation, a suitable 

carbohydrate is converted to lactic acid by microorganisms. 
14

  



10 

 

The first step of the polymerization is the formation of a linear dimer (lactoyl lactic 

acid). This condensation reaction can proceed to higher oligomers and is promoted by 

elimination of water. Also a cyclic dimer, lactide, is formed in small amounts. Lactide can 

be formed by intramolecular esterification of lactoyl lactic acid or by breakdown of higher 

oligomers. All reactions are equilibrium reactions (Figure 8).
15

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 8 – Lactic acid condensation reactions-interchange between lactide, oligomers, and poly(lactic 

acide).
15

 

 

Lactic acid can form PLA by means of the reaction of the hydroxyl and carboxylic 

acid groups of lactic acid. By removing the water formed during this condensation 

reaction, the reaction proceeds towards the product side, PLA. The preparation of PLA 

from lactic acid by direct condensation can be divided into three principal stages: i) 

removal of the free water content, ii) oligomer polycondensation, and iii) melt 

polycondensation of high molecular weight PLA.
15

  

High molecular mass PLA is obtained either by the polycondensation of lactic acid 

or by ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of the cyclic dimer 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-dioxane-



11 

 

2,5-dione commonly referred to as dilactic or lactide. The generally applied ROP process 

for polylactides involves three separate steps: polycondensation, lactide manufacturing, 

and ring-opening polymerization.
15

  

Commercial PLA is usually prepared from L-lactic (LLA), because the resulting 

polymer poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) is semicrystalline with a relatively high melting and 

glass transition temperature (Tg). 

Polylactides have been known for several decades but only recently have these 

polymers gained commercial significance as a leading environmentally benign plastic 

available from renewable resources. The production of lactic acid started in the United 

States in the 1880s, and, unfortunately the process of fermentation of vegetable sugars was 

not very sucessful.
15

 In 1950, the first commercial production of synthetic lactic acid 

started in Japan.
15

 In 1966 occurred the first application of polylactides as implants, sutures 

and orthopedic fixation, with advantage over nondegradable biomaterials  eliminating the 

need to remove implants and providing long-term biocompatibility, furthermore, it was 

observed that the degradation of PLLA powder implanted had a nontoxic tissue response.
15

 

Only in 1990, the use of poly (lactic acid) (PLA) in  packaging and other commercial 

ends started (Table 1).

Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a biodegradable thermoplastic polyester that has been the 

subject of intensive research due to its intrinsic characteristics, such as biodegradability 

and sustainability, since it is made from natural resources like corn, sugar beet and wheat. 

PLA exhibits many properties that are equivalent or superior to those of many petroleum-

based plastics, which makes it suitable for a large variety of applications. 
16

  



12 

 

Figure 9 presents a comparison of the physical properties of PLA to other 

commodity thermoplastics. It is seen that PLA compares favourably with polystyrene, 

(PS), a widely used plastic based on non-renewable resources. It should be noted though, 

that PLA has a glass transition temperature that is significantly lower, Tg ? 59 ºC, than 

polystyrene, Tg ? 100 ºC. This translates into a lower heat distortion temperature and limits 

the applicability of PLA for applications requiring better heat resistance. 
17

 

 

 

 

Figure 9 – Physical properties of PLA compared to other common plastics.
17

 

  

 Packages made with plastic, in contrast to glass or metal packaging material, are 

permeable, at different degrees, to small molecules like gases, water vapour, and organic 

vapour and to other low molecular weight compounds like aromas, flavour, and additives 

present into food.
18

 The knowledge of the solution/diffusion/permeation behaviours of 

these molecules through the polymer film has become increasingly important in recent 

years, especially for polymers used in the food packaging field where contamination from 

external environment has to be avoided and the shelf life of the food controlled by the use 

of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) techniques.
18

 

PLA is currently used for single or multilayer films, trays, cups, and bottles, and 

can be manufactured by extrusion, thermoforming, injection and blow molding processes 

for packaging applications. PLA is also suitable for the production and use of functional 

membranes.
19

 It has been reported that PLA is more suitable than polyethylene or 



13 

 

polystyrene as packaging material for juices, yoghurt, salad dressing and sour cream. 

Nevertheless, when tested with cheese, a moisture loss of 10 times higher than of the 

reference packaging (PET) material was observed.
20

  

Despite PLA shows good physical properties, similar to those of PS and poly(ethylene 

terephthalate, PET, the  relatively high oxygen permeability of PLA and its brittleness are 

main drawbacks for flexible packaging applications, namely foods and/or pharmaceuticals 

products susceptible to oxidation.
19

 The fact that PLA has higher carbon dioxide and 

oxygen permeability than polystyrene, low density polyethylene, LDPE, and poly(ethylene 

terephthalate), clearly indicates that the development of PLA packaging requires further 

efforts.  

 

1.3. Active packaging 
 

 Important functionalities of packaging are not only to ensure food safety, but also to 

guarantee the organoleptic quality of the packed product during its shelf- life. Shelf-life is 

defined as the time during which the food product will: i) remain safe; ii) be certain to 

retain desired sensory, chemical, physical and microbiological characteristics; iii) comply 

with any label declaration of nutritional data, when stored under the recommended 

conditions.
21

 Many factors can influence shelf-life, and can be categorized into intrinsic 

and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors are influenced by variables such as raw material type 

and quality, and product formulation and structure. 

They include the following: 

• Water activity (aw) (available water). 

• pH value and total acidity; type of acid. 

• Redox potential (Eh). 

• Available oxygen. 

• Nutrients. 

• Natural microflora and surviving microbiological counts. 

• Natural biochemistry of the product formulation (enzymes, chemical reactants). 

• Use of preservatives in product formulation (e.g. salt). 

Extrinsic factors are those the final product encounters as it moves through the food 

chain. They include the following: 



14 

 

• Time–temperature profile during processing; pressure in the headspace. 

• Temperature control during storage and distribution. 

• Relative humidity (RH) during processing, storage and distribution. 

• Exposure to light (UV and IR) during processing, storage and distribution. 

• Environmental microbial counts during processing, storage and distribution. 

• Composition of atmosphere within packaging. 

• Subsequent heat treatment (e.g. reheating or cooking before consumption). 

• Consumer handling. 

All these factors can operate in an interactive and often unpredictable way, and the 

possibility of cross-interactions must be investigated. A particularly useful type of 

interaction occurs when factors such as reduced temperature, mild heat treatment, 

antioxidant action and controlled atmosphere packaging operate in synergy to restrict 

microbial growth, the so-called ‘hurdle effect’. This way of combining factors which, 

individually, are unable to prevent microbial growth but, in combination, provide a series 

of hurdles, allows manufacturers to use milder processing techniques which retain more of 

a product’s sensory and nutritional properties.
21

  

The interaction of such intrinsic and extrinsic factors inhibits or stimulates a number 

of processes which limit the product shelf-life. These processes can be classified as 

microbiological, chemical, physical and temperature related. 
21

 

Table 2 shows some examples of processes associated to the deterioration of several 

food classes. In composite foods the factors limiting shelf-life can be quite different from 

those that limit the shelf-life of the individual components. For example, an important 

factor limiting shelf-life in breakfast cereals containing a mixture of cereal and dried fruit 

is the hardening of the fruit from moisture migration into the cereal. In contrast, the 

limiting factors for the individual fruit and cereal components would be flavor changes 

arising from chemical reactions, and moisture uptake and softening of the cereal. There are 

many factors to be considered in choosing the optimal packaging form and material for any 

particular product, including the product characteristics, processing considerations, shelf-

life required and overall cost. In many cases, packaging is an integral part of the processing 

stage. Advances in packaging materials and techniques have increased the options 

available for maintaining quality and for improving the shelf-life of foods.
21

Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP), which involves replacing the air in the headspace 

of a packaged product with a single or mixture of special gases, has made the greatest 

impact on the shelf-life of chilled products. The gases commonly used are carbon dioxide 

and nitrogen. Carbon dioxide is used to suppress microbial growth, but its effectiveness is 

very much dependent on the sensitivity of different classes of microorganisms to this gas. 

Nitrogen is used as a inert filler, since oxygen is to be excluded to prevent aerobic 

spoilage. One special case, however, is that of fresh fruit and vegetables, where a delicate 

balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen is necessary to allow aerobic respiration to continue 

at a very low rate and thereby extend shelf-life. One of the requirements of food packaging 

is that it should play a passive role, remaining inert and not interacting with the food it 

contains. 
21

  However, as a result of new consumer trends, a demand for better fresh-like 

quality using convenient food products intensifiers made traditional packaging concepts 

outdated. Besides the protection of the foods shape and texture, preservation of flavors and 

odours, shelf-life extension and control of the water or moisture content of foods, the 

packaging industry has been developing a new innovative concept: active packaging. 
22–24 



16 

 

This is a type of packaging where changes in the packaging atmosphere are promoted in 

order to fulfil one or more specific objectives, such as the extension of its shelf-life and the 

increase of the packaged foods safety and quality. 
22

 

 Active packaging systems can be regarded as active scavenging/releasing systems. 

While in the first type undesired compounds such as oxygen, ethylene, carbon dioxide or 

moisture are removed, in the last compounds such as carbon dioxide, water, antioxidants or 

preservatives are added. The most studied of these compounds are undoubtly oxygen and 

carbon dioxide. Although CO2 has a beneficial effect in microbiological control and in the 

storage of foods such as meat, cheese or fish, an excess of CO2 may cause package 

collapse, promoting anaerobic metabolism, pH reduction and flavor change. Micro-

perforation is the most used method to control CO2 content inside the package, due the 

deterioration or respiration reactions, by increasing the permeability of the gas through the 

packaging material. 
25,26

 

 On the other hand, oxygen is responsible for several undesirable chemical reactions 

in foods, promoting the growth of aerobic microbes and the spoilage of many foods by 

microbial attack. Nonetheless, oxygen inhibits the growth of anaerobic micro-

organisms.
25,26

  The mould growth control and the delay in the rancidity development of 

vegetable oils are the most important application of oxygen scavenging systems in food 

packaging.
26

 Usually, these active packaging technologies make use of sachets with active 

compounds, such as iron powder, ascorbic acid, photosensitive dyes and enzymes but these 

approaches meet some resistance due to the accidental spill and consumption of sachet 

contents.
24,25

 

 There is a growing interest in bioactive packaging through the use of natural 

compounds incorporated into the polymer wall of the package in order to increase the 

foods shelf-life and, at same time, prevent the oxidation of polymer by thermal 

degradation. Antioxidants are widely used as food additives to improve the stability of 

lipids to oxidation and to prolong shelf-life of dried products and oxygen sensitive foods. 

They have also been incorporated in small concentrations into plastic films to obtain 

additional stability under processing conditions.
27–29

 

Therefore, the barrier properties of the packaging polymer against the transfer of small 

gaseous molecules, such as O2, CO2 or H2O, are important
9
, and should prevent food 

degradation and oxidation, preserving aromas and flavours
13

. In particular, oxygen is an 



17 

 

excellent oxidizing agent of lipids which can cause deterioration of product quality. 

Moreover, barrier properties against light, water vapor, atmospheric gases and larger 

volatile molecules, such as aroma compounds, need to be assessed since the transfer of 

these compounds into the polymer could cause a modification of the aroma formulation of 

the packaged food leading to a deterioration of its quality.

1.4. Scope 
 

The central idea behind this thesis was to develop a biodegradable poly(lactic acid) (PLA)-

based packaging system that can provide an extended shelf life for foods and improve food 

safety, improving its barrier properties. PLA, was selected for this study since it is obtained 

from natural renewable resources and presents mechanical properties comparable to 

hydrocarbon based polymers and with excellent flavor and odor barrier.
30,31,32

 PLA is 

already used as a packaging material for the storage of fresh-fruits and vegetables or foods 

with short shelf-life. In order to improve PLA’s barrier properties, antioxidants (natural 

and artificial) were incorporated in films of PLA. The objective of this study is to evaluate 

the impact of the addition of three antioxidants ?-tocopherol, 2,6-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-

methylphenol or (Butylated hydroxytoluene), BHT, and 2-(1,1-Dimethylethyl)-1,4-

benzenediol or tert-Butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) (Figure 12) in PLA films. For that 

purpose, films with different quantities of antioxidant were prepared and thermal, 

mechanical and barrier properties were measured so that their suitability as a polymer 

materials for food packaging can be assessed.

2.1. Introduction 
 

The selection of a polymeric material for certain application depend on the 

performance of the membrane and specially of the glass transition temperature, Tg, and the 

crystallinity which are important parameters and affect directly the transfer of small 

molecules through the membrane. These parameters are determined by structural factors 

such as chain flexibility, chain interaction, chain symmetry, presence of lateral chains, 

extent of polymer chain unsaturation, presence of polar groups in the polymer backbone, 

orientation of the polymer chains and degree of crosslinking, cohesive energy of the 

polymer and molecular weight and presence of additives.
33,34

 The knowledge of Tg is 

essential in the selection of materials for various applications. In general, values of Tg well 

below room temperature define the domain of elastomers and values above room 

temperature define rigid and structural polymers, i.e., the mechanical and physical 

properties change drastically over a relatively small temperature interval covering the glass 

transition temperature. The glassy state of a polymer can be considered as a frozen state 

with a highly restricted chain mobility.
33

 However, in the presence of some substances, 

depression of the glass transition may occur due to an increase on the free volume.  

Most of the dense materials used as food packaging are made up of semi-crystalline 

polymers (PE, PP, PET) in which both phases can be distinguished: an amorphous phase 

and a crystalline phase (Figure 10). When the crystallization occurs in solution, the 

polymeric chains fold back and forth, forming folded chain lamellar crystals, connected to 

the amorphous regions by polymer chains.  

  

Figure 10 – Semi-crystalline polymer structure presenting lamellar crystals connected by polymer chains 

(amorphous regions). 



21 

 

In the melted state, the polymer chains are highly entangled therefore the folding of 

chains during the nucleation and crystallization process is hindered.
35

 Crystallization from 

the melted polymer results in the formation of spherical crystal aggregates, the so-called 

spherulites, notably at isothermal crystallization at low supercooling.
35

 

Typically, polymer crystals are not in thermal equilibrium since their formation is 

strongly complicated and hindered due to the connectivity of the segments, involving co-

operative movements of a large number of connected monomers.
35

 Although the free 

energy would be lowest for fully extended crystalline molecules, long polymers usually 

form much thinner lamellae (“chain-folding”). Therefore, polymer crystals represent meta-

stable states with a significant degree of disorder, mainly characterized by the degree of 

chain foldind.
35

  

Three parameters whose role is essential when dealing with mass transfer through 

polymeric matrices are free volume, glass transition temperature, and crystallinity of the 

polymer, which are also function of previously given factors.
34

 Diffusion in semicrystalline 

polymers is complicated by the presence of crystallites. Crystalline zones are excluded 

volumes where molecules cannot sorb and increase the path that diffusing molecules must 

pass in the membrane because they increase tortuosity and may also decrease the mobility 

of the amorphous polymeric chains because chain ends could be trapped in the neighboring 

crystalline lamellae.
34

 In the amorphous part, the diffusion mechanism is different 

according to whether the membrane is in a rubbery or a glassy state at the temperature of 

use (above or below of Tg).
34

 Membranes in the glassy state are actually not in equilibrium 

because the time necessary for a polymer in the glassy state to relax, i.e., for its structure to 

rearrange in response to external changes, is long. Membranes in the rubbery state are at 

equilibrium and do not contain fixed regions of non equilibrium excess volume because the 

structure rearranges promptly in response to external changes.
34

  

The concept of free volume is useful for explaining aspects of the chain mobility 

and permeability of polymers. Free volume (microvoids), including its nanostructure 

characteristics (mean size and size distribution of microcavities, their spatial arrangement 

and topology), determines many properties of glassy polymers and in particular, the 

transport parameters of membrane materials such as permeability and diffusion coefficients 

of gases.
36

 The relation between the free volume and the polymer mobility is frequently 

studied by measuring the diffusion properties of small molecules in polymers. As a general 



22 

 

rule, gases solubility, diffusivity and permeability increase with the increase in free 

volume. In semi-crystalline polymers (PP, PE, PET…), free volume is linked to Tg of the 

amorphous part.
34

 Conceptually, permeation of small gas molecules through a glassy 

polymer is viewed as proceeding by jump motion whereby a permeant molecule spends 

most of the time in free-volume cavities and occasionally jumps to a neighboring cavity.
37

  

The jump motion proceeds by formation of a channel between two neighboring holes. Thus 

gas permeation depends on the number and size of cavities in the polymer matrix (static 

free volume) and the frequency of channel formation (dynamic free volume). Static free 

volume is essentially independent of thermally accessible motions of the polymer chains 

and relates to gas sorption, S. Dynamic free volume derives from accessible 

conformational changes and segmental motions of the polymer chain and relates to gas 

diffusivity, D.
37

 

In recent years many efforts have been devoted to the development, formulation and 

characterization of new ecologically friendly and sustainable plastic materials that can 

overcome the major environmental problems created by the extensive use of petrochemical 

based plastics. In particular, PLA has been playing a dominant role among biorenewable 

resources plastics. As we mentioned in the previous section, many important properties of 

PLA are controlled by ratio of D- to L- enantiomers used and the sequence of arrangement 

of the enantiomers in the polymers. PLLA constitutes the main fraction of PLA derived 

from renewable sources since the majority of lactic acid obtained from biological sources 

exists as LLA. PLA with PLLA content higher than 90 % tends to be crystalline while that 

with lower optical purity is amorphous. The melting temperature, Tm, glass transition 

temperature, Tg, and crystallinity of PLA decrease with decreasing amounts of PLLA.
15

  

Thermoplastic polymers exhibit many properties ideal for use in packaging and other 

consumer products, such as light weight, low process temperature (compared to metal and 

glass), variable barrier properties to match endues applications, good printability, heat 

sealable, and ease of conversion into different forms.
38

 Similar to many thermoplastics 

polymers, semicrystalline PLA exhibits Tg and Tm. Above Tg (~58 ºC) PLA is rubbery, 

while below Tg, it becomes a glass. Figure 11 displays the Tg and Tm of thermoplastics 

polymers.
38

  

 

 



23 

 

 

Figure 11 – Glass transition temperature and melting temperature of PLA and other thermoplastics.
38

 

 

The properties of PLA such as thermal stability and impact resistance are inferior to 

those of conventional polymers used for thermoplastic applications.
38

 The inherent 

brittleness of PLA has been a major bottleneck for its large-scale commercial 

applications.
39

 Therefore, PLA is not ideally suited to compete against the conventional 

polymers.
38

 Despite the good mechanical properties and processability as well as 

biocompatibility of PLA, to replace the polyolefins in packaging material and hygiene 

products, as diapers, and milk cartons, PLA film have to be flexible, because in the 

industrial production line of packaging material as well as diapers, there is no tolerance for 

the film cracking or tearing when folded or subject to force during manufacturing.
40

 Since 

PLA is rigid and brittle with low ability to plastic deformation below glass transition 

temperature, numerous approaches such as plasticization, block copolymerization, 

blending with tough polymers, and rubber toughening have been adopted to improve the 

toughness of brittle polylactide bioplastic.
39

 The major drawbacks of these methods are the 

substantial decreases in the strength and modulus of the toughened polylactide. So, a 

polylactide-based material having good stiffness-toughness balance along with high 

biobased polylactide content is still elusive.
39

 

One of the most used methods to overcome the problem of the brittleness is plasticize 

the PLA in order to produce flexible films. Several types of chemicals have been tried to 

plasticize PLA such as citrate esters, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), glucose monoesters and 

partial fatty acid esters, resulting in materials with better deformation capacity and 



24 

 

resilience.
41

 Also, blends of PLA with various non-biodegradable polymers, and with 

others aliphatic polyesters such as poly (??caprolactone), poly(butylene succinate) and 

poly(hydroxy butyrate) were also reported in the literature.41 Various compounds are 

reported as efficient plasticizing for PLA including poly(3-methyl-1,4-dioxan-2-one), 

poly(ethylene oxide), citrate esters, triacetine, and poly(ethylene glycol)s (PEGs).
42

 Some 

of these blends were found to be immiscible, resulting in fairly poor mechanical 

properties.
41

  

The expansion of PLA´s application to the packaging industry passes essentially 

through the ability to tailor its gas barrier properties and flexural properties such as rigidity 

and brittleness, which are an expression of its low deformation at break. The choice of 

polymers or plasticizers to be used as modifiers for PLA is limited by the requirements of 

the application. For packaging and hygiene applications, only nontoxic substances 

approved for food contact and personal care can be considered as plasticizing agents.
40

 

Antioxidants are widely used as food additives to improve the stability of lipids to 

oxidation and to prolong shelf-life of dried products and oxygen sensitive foods. They have 

also been incorporated in small concentrations in films to obtain additional stability 

(chemical, thermal) under processing conditions. 
27–29,43–45

 

In this context, antioxidant-active packaging is a promising approach to extend the 

shelf-life and improve safety and sensorial properties, while maintaining the food quality. 

Several antioxidants have already been incorporated into different polymeric film 

structures for the intentional purpose of migration into food to prevent its oxidation.
28,46–48 

The impregnation of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved antioxidants, in 

polymeric films has also been subject of research. ?-tocopherol (the component of Vitamin 

E which has the highest free radical scavenging activity) is a natural antioxidant that has 

already been studied as a polymer film stabilizer as well as an antioxidant. Recognized as 

safe and worldwide approved for use in food applications, ?-tocopherol has been used to 

improve the biostability and biocompatibility of different materials.
43,49,50

 Reno et al.
51

 

studied the effect of ?-tocopherol added to poly((D,L)lactic acid) for medical applications 

and it was verified that it alters the surface wettability. Wessling et al.
29

 observed that 

incorporation of high levels (3600 ppm) of ?-tocopherol into LDPE films inhibits the 

oxidation of organic acids stored in contact with the film. More recently, Byun et. al
52

 

clearly showed the high antioxidant activity of ?-tocopherol, by the incorporation of 1 % 



25 

 

of ?-tocopherol PLA films, which increased the radical scavenging activity from 0.84 % to 

90.43 %.
52

 Manzanares-López et al.
53

 added 2.58 wt% of ?-tocopherol into PLA films and 

studied the films thermal and optical properties as well as effect of the release of the 

antioxidant on the oxidative stability of soybean oil. No significantly effect was observed 

on Tg and Tm. Ortiz-Vazquez et al.
54

 studied the use  of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), 

another antioxidant also approved by FDA, in PLA films for packaging of coconut oil and 

concluded that the addition of 0.79 wt.% of BHT to the PLA film had no effect on thermal, 

oxygen and water barrier properties of the PLA films.  

Nevertheless, recent contradictory results show that the addition of 1 wt.% of synthetic 

phenolic antioxidants including BHT, butylated hydroxyanisole, tert-butylhydroquinone 

(TBHQ) and propyl gallate had no significant effect on the glass transition and melting 

temperature, water vapour and oxygen permeability of PLA films.
55

 However, Hwang et 

al. 
56

 demonstrated that the combination effect of two natural antioxidants (?-tocopherol 

and resveratrol) with differing concentrations can play a critical role on the thermal and 

mechanical properties of PLLA films.  

In conclusion, the available literature only addresses the incorporation of very small 

amounts of antioxidant and most studies only assess rates, effects and release mechanisms 

of the antioxidants.  This chapter explores the incorporation of antioxidants into PLA 

films and their effect on thermal, surface and mechanical properties. For that purpose, three 

antioxidants were selected, one natural (?-tocopherol) and two synthetic (BHT and 

TBHQ). ?-tocopherol, a lipid-soluble antioxidant that has already been intensively studied 

as a polymer film stabilizer, was chosen due to its highest free radical scavenging 

activity.
57

 BHT and TBHQ are commonly used in food industry and were chosen because 

they have similar structures but different molar volumes.
55

 The chemical structures of the 

antioxidants used in this work are shown in Figure 12.

BHT is a lipid-soluble antioxidant commonly used in the plastics, pharmaceutical 

and food industries. BHT terminates free-radical chain reactions by donating hydrogen 

atoms to free radicals producing more stable compounds. In the U.S.A., direct addition of 

BHT to some food emulsion is specifically regulated, but this antioxidant is generally 

recognized as safe for use in food when the total content of antioxidants is not over 0.02 % 

of the fat or oil content

Portugal). Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), 99 % purity, was obtained from SAFC Global 

(Lisboa, Portugal). Dichoromethane was supplied from Sigma-Aldrich (Sintra, Portugal) 

with analytical reagent grade. Solvents were used with no further purification. 

 



27 

 

2.2.2. Samples preparation 
 

 

 PLA films with and without antioxidants were prepared from solutions with 60 mg/ml  

of PLA in dichloromethane. Different amounts of AT, BHT and TBHQ to the PLA were 

added to obtain solutions with concentrations of 2 wt%, 4 wt %, 6 wt% and 10 wt% of 

each antioxidants to the polymer. All the solutions were magnetically stirred during at least  

12 h for complete dissolution Thin films were prepared by casting each solution into Petri 

dishes and dichloromethane was left to evaporate at room temperature from 24 h in the 

dark place (cabinet) to avoid antioxidants degradation. Solvent evaporation took place 

slowly in order to obtain homogeneous films. Structural, mechanical, thermal and barrier 

properties were investigated. 

 

2.2.3. Film Characterization 
 

2.2.3.1. Infra-red spectroscopy 
 

Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infra-Red (ATR-FTIR) spectrophotometer, 

FT Bruker IFS 55, was used to obtain spectra of thin films co-adding 256 scans at a 

resolution of 8 cm
-1

. Spectra were collected from 4000 to 400 cm
-1

.  

 

2.2.3.2. Optical microscopy 
 

Microscope Olympus BX51 with polarized light was used to observe the effect of ?-

tocopherol on the growth and morphology of spherulites when a sample is subjected to 

thermal treatment by melting and subsequent annealing at temperature above Tg or 

quenched at temperature 0 ºC. The study of the crystallite growth was achieved using films 

which were melted at 200 ºC for 3 minutes, and then crystallized at the annealing 

temperature of 140 ºC for 60 minutes.  

 

 



28 

 

2.2.3.3. Dynamic mechanical analysis 
 

Rectangular specimens of the films prepared were tested in a dynamic mechanical 

analyzer Tritec 2000 DMA, Triton Technology Ltd. Displacement and force amplitudes 

were adjusted according to samples for a single cantiliver bending deformation mode. The 

experiments were done at 1 Hz of frequency in temperature range from 30 ºC to 100 ºC 

with heating rate of 2 ºC/min. The storage modulus or Young’s modulus and the 

dissipation factor, tan ?, with temperature were monitored.  

 

2.2.3.4. Thermal properties 
 

 The dynamic degradation was carried using a thermogravimetric analyser 

Shimadzu TGA-50. The dynamic tests were run at a heating rate of 10 K/min from room 

temperature up to 773 K and in nitrogen environment (flow rate 20 mL/min) to guarantee 

the constancy of atmosphere during the whole test. Samples between 4 and 20 mg were 

used without any previous treatment.  

A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), Shimadzu DSC-50/DTA-50, was used to 

determine the antioxidant effects on the glass transition temperature (Tg), melting 

temperature (Tm) and degree of crystallinity (
c

? ) of the PLA films. About 5 mg of each 

film sample was weighed in an aluminum pan, and were subjected to the following three 

DSC runs at 10 K/min: i) heating from 263 K to 523 K; ii) cooling from 523 K to 263 K, 

and finally iii) heating from 263 K to 523 K. The first scan is used to measure the 

crystallization percentage, considering 93.6 J/g for a 100 % crystalline L-PLA
58

 and the 

second scan is used to calculate the glass transition temperature without polymer stress. 

The experiments were carried out under constant nitrogen atmosphere. The transition 

temperature as well as the enthalpy of melting (7Hm) was calibrated using indium as the 

standard. The degree of crystallinity of the PLA films was calculated according to the

2.2.3.5. Scanning electron microscopy 
 

The morphology of the resulting membranes was characterized by Ultra-high 

Resolution Analytical Scanning Electron Microscope HR-FESEM Hitachi SU-70 

equipment operating at 15 kV. To increase the conductivity, a carbon coating was 

deposited on top of all film samples. 

 

2.2.3.6. Atomic force microscopy AFM) 
 

For atomic force microscopy (AFM) observation, a NanoScope III scanning 

microscope equipped with a hot-stage accessory (Digital Instruments) was used. All 

experiments were carried out in the tapping mode. AFM height, amplitude and phase 

images were recorded simultaneously. Resolutions of 256×256 data points per image were 

used to collect the images. Si tips (PPP-NCHR) with a resonance frequency of 

approximately 320 kHz and a spring constant of about 40 N/m were used. The scanning 

rate was 0.5 Hz.  

2.2.3.7. X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
 

A Philips X-ray diffractometer X’Pert model equipped with a (CuK?) source was 

used to study the crystallites growth in films subjected to different thermal treatments. The 

analysis was performed at 25 ºC with a 2? range of 5º- 40º using a scan speed of 1 º/min.  

 

2.2.3.8. Contact angle measurements 
 

Contact angle (?) measurements with water, formamide, ethylene glycol and 

diiodomethane were performed at room temperature using a surface energy evolution 

system coupled with a video camera and image analysis software commercialized by Brno 



30 

 

University (Brno, Czech Republic). Each ? value is the average of five independent 

determinations acquired immediately after the drop deposition. These values were used to 

calculate the polar and dispersive components of the surface energy of PLA films using the 

Owens-Wendt’s approach. 
59

 

 

 

2.3. Results and discussion 
 

 

Before beginning the characterization of the films by different techniques, it is important to 

describe the appearance of the films after enriched PLA with the different antioxidants. 

The PLA films had different appearance depending on the antioxidant used. PLA films 

containing ?-tocopherol have become yellowish over time while the films with BHT were 

very similar to neat PLA, becaming opaque. The brittleness remained in films containing 

the two antioxidants. Finally, PLA blended with TBHQ films were the most interesting, 

because the membranes were transparent and significantly more flexible. From visual 

inspection we can conclude that PLA/TBHQ films should be less crystalline that the other 

antioxidants enriched films.

2.3.1. Infra-red spectroscopy 

The infrared spectra of PLA and PLA enriched with various concentrations of antioxidants 

films were recorded in the spectral region of 3500 to 500 cm
-1 

and are presented in Figure 

13 for ?-tocopherol, Figure 14 for TBHQ and  Figure 15 for BHT. In Figure 13, the 

increase in the intensity of the band at 3000 cm

 with the increase in the amount of ?-

tocopherol in films confirms that the additivation procedure was successful. The control of 

PLA structure is done using the band at 1748 cm

Figure 14 shows the spectra of TBHQ, neat PLA and PLA enriched with TBHQ (4,4 wt%). 

In the film of PLA/TBHQ spectrum, we can observe the appearance of the characteristic 

bands of TBHQ, thus confirming the presence of the antioxidant in the film. The broad 

band at 3508 cm
-1

 can be assigned to the –OH stretch of the phenol, which usually appears 

at 3445 and 3279 cm
-1

, or –OH free from PLA which usually appears at 3571 cm
-1

, or both. 

The bands from 2994 to 2874 cm
-1

 are assigned to the CH stretching region (CH3(asym), 

CH3(sym), and CH modes) of PLA and =C- (alkenes, aromatics) from TBHQ. The phenyl 

ring and –C-OH in plane are responsible for bands at 1590, 1490 and 1442 cm
-1

 in TBHQ. 



32 

 

Near these bands, the ?asCH3 stretching of PLA appears at about 1452 cm
-1

. The weak 

band at about 1500 cm
-1 

should be then assigned at phenyl ring and –C-OH in the plane 

bending. The increased intensity of the band at 1360 cm
-1

 and the band at 1310 cm
-1

 are 

assigned to the methyl bending vibration (?sCH3 + ?CH), found in both PLA and TBHQ. 

The bands at 810 and 775 cm
-1

 are assigned to –CH out of plan and ring torsion of the 

TBHQ.

The bands that are assigned to BHT found in the additivated films, ensures presence of this 

compound in the films. The –OH stretching vibration at about 3630 cm

In the spectrum of PLA/BHT, this band appears as a broad band. The broad band at about

2.3.2. Optical microscopy 
 

The enhancement of the thermal stability of PLA is a matter that has been receiving a large 

amount of attention, both from the processing and the application point of view. The effect 

of ?-tocopherol in the density of spherulites when the films are melted followed by 

annealing at a crystallization temperature (Tc) above the Tg can be evaluated from the 

Figure 16. The polarizing optical micrographs show an increase in the number of 

spherulites with the increase of ?-tocopherol content in the films. However, no spherulites 

are observed when the films are melted and quenched at 0 ºC. So, the overall 

crystallization of PLA enriched with ?-tocopherol can be scrupulously selected and the 

final properties of films should be very well analyzed. As the crystallites can cause 

tortuosity, the present study on the effect of ?-tocopherol on sorption of gases in 

additivated films will be performed using the last procedure to prepare our films, i.e., 

completely amorphous films.

2.3.3. Dynamic mechanical analysis  
 

Dynamic mechanical spectra of samples, including PLA with 2.2 % and 4.4 % of 

??tocopherol are shown in Figure 17. Polymeric properties are temperature-dependent. 

Plastics are hard and rigid at room temperature  (20º C), but become softer at high 

temperature. This hardness or stiffness is measured as a modulus, a ratio of stress to strain 

at a certain stage of deformation. The decrease in Young’s modulus (E’) of samples is 

accompanied by a peak in the viscous dissipation, tan ? (Figure 18). Lower modulus values 



35 

 

are found in films with higher concentrations of ?-tocopherol. A decrease of 37 % and 41 

% for 2.2 % and 4.4 % were observed. This behaviour is similar to that found in plasticized 

films with glycerol, PEG or OLA by Martin et al 
60

 and suggests that the material became 

more flexible in the presence of ?-tocopherol, i.e., lower storage modulus shows that the 

softness increases with addition of ?-tocopherol content.

Because the tan ? peaks related to glass transition of enriched films with ?-tocopherol  are 

very weak and broad, it was not possible the determination of Tg. Shibata et al 
61

 

associated the broadening of the tan ? at a slight compatibility between two phases. In our 

case, and judging from the following SEM results, the broadening of the tan ? peak may be 

due a heterogeneous distribution of ?-tocopherol into PLA.

2.3.4. Thermal properties 
 

The thermal stability of the films was monitored by themogravimetrical analysis. No 

significant differences were noticed in thermal degradation temperature, as can be seen 

from Figure 19 to Figure 21. All films exhibited similar degradations stages, characterized 

by only weight loss region. The degradation temperatures of the films containing different 

amounts of antioxidants were obtained by DTG curve analysis are shown in Table 3.

For additivated films, the thermal stability decrease with the antioxidant content. Of the 

three antioxidants, TBHQ might act as a thermal stabilizer for the PLA/antioxidant films.  

 The DSC thermogram obtained during the first heating of the samples enriched 

with BHT 2 % wt and TBHQ 2 % wt are presented in Figure 22 and shows that the films 

enriched with TBHQ exhibits a broad crystallization in the range 350 K - 400 K, centered 

at about 378 K.  This peak reflects the large amorphous component in the cooled 

PLA/TBHT film. When the polymer is heating, the molecules acquire thermal energy, and 

at glass transition temperature, the molecules have enough energy to overcome the 

intermolecular forces and they have more freedom of movement. The amorphous region 

becomes rubbery and the polymer become soft and flexible. With heat, the molecules in 

amorphous phase  have mobility to arrange themselves into an ordered crystal. 

Crystallisation is an exothermic process, and a correspondent peak appears in the 

thermogram. During the first heating, this arranges crystalline appears in the same range of 

temperatures only for PLA enriched films with TBHQ and have a centered peak about 378 

K to 2 wt% and 5 wt% of TBHQ and  374 K for PLA enriched with 10 wt% TBHQ, i.e., 

the TC obtained from the first heating of the PLA/TBHQ films shift to lower temperatures 

(Figure 23). During the cooling, the amount of TBHQ decrease the enthalpy of 

crystallization, and causes a band broadening centered at about 369 K (Figure 24). 

PLA/BHT enriched films do not exhibit crystallization during the first heating. The Figure 

23 and Figure 25 show that PLA films enriched with both antioxidants TBHQ and BHT 

exhibits a crystallisation peak in second heating. The rearrange that occurs in this heating 

should be of the crystals formed during the cooling after the first heating, are therefore of 

different nature from that appears in the first heat of PLA/TBHQ, ones formed from the 

solution and the other from the melted. The crystallization temperature shift to high 

temperature region for both BHT and TBHQ enriched films relatively at neat PLA. The 

results of DSC analysis are shown in Table 4 (firs heating) and Table 5 (second heating).

The addition of BHT and TBHQ increase the crystallization temperature of the 

melted samples formed during the cooling after first heating. The highest Tc = 396 K was 

obtained for PLA with 5 wt% of TBHQ, more 12 K than neat PLA. In the samples with 

thermal treatment by DSC, the crystallization occurred around 390 K for all samples, more 

6 K than for neat PLA.   

For films without thermal treatment by DSC, the crystallinity of PLA/TBHQ films 

seems to be independent of the antioxidant content and is about 61 % lower than neat PLA. 

The crystallinity increase 1 % relatively at neat PLA for 2 wt % of BHT and then decrease 

11 % to 5 % and 10 wt %  of BHT.  

Neat PLA melted in DSC presents a crystallinity of 20 %, i.e., 56 % lower than 

without thermal treatment. The crystallinity of PLA/BHT melted films decrease with the 

amount of BHT into the film, from 16 % to 9 % to 2 wt % and 10 wt % of BHT, 

respectively. For enriched films with TBHQ, the crystallinity is almost constant ~12 % and  

independent of the amount of TBHQ in the film.  

Melted pure PLA exhibited a Tg around 331 K and a melting temperature, around 

438 K. The addition 2 wt % of BHT increase 3 K the Tg, and 10 wt %  of BHT decrease 5 

K. It is thought that the increase of Tg with small amounts of ??? disturb the mobility of 

amorphous PLA. The presence of strong interactions between the PLA and BHT seems to 

occur, despite the fact that the presence of aromatic rings in the backbone should have a 

more dramatic effect on Tg. Their presence seems to hinder the lateral polymer chains to 

moving, acting as a filler. At high concentrations of antioxidants, we can observe a small 

plasticizer effect, since the Tg decrease about 5 K relatively at neat PLA. Similar results 



42 

 

were found for PLA/TBHQ films. The Tg decrease with the amount of TBHQ into the 

film, decreasing only 6 K to 10 wt% of antioxidant. The melting temperature decrease 4 K 

for BHT and 3 K for TBHQ, both BHT and TBHQ 10 wt%. 

What happens with ?-tocopherol, a large molecule compared with BHT and TBHQ 

compounds? Figure 26 show the effect of the addition of ?-tocopherol on Tg, TC and Tm.

Figure 26 - DSC thermogram obtained during second heating of samples enriched with 2 wt%, 4 wt%, 6 

wt% and 8 wt% of ?-tocopherol. 
 

The crystallization temperature for enriched films with ?-tocopherol shift to a lower 

temperature and its enthalpy increases by incorporation of a small amount of ?-tocopherol 

(2 wt %) but decrease with the increase of ?-tocopherol in the film (Table 5). The ?-

tocopherol causes an opposite effect on Tc than the other antioxidants, while BHT and 

TBHQ shift the TC to higher temperatures, ?-tocopherol shift to lower temperature. 

Crystallization temperature decrease to 342 K with the incorporation of 8 wt % of ?-

tocopherol, a decrease of 42 K when compared to that of neat PLA.

 The crystallinity does not change with the amount of ?-tocopherol content in the 

film up to 6 % and then increases to about twice from 16 % to 25 % to 8 wt% of ?-

tocopherol. No significantly changes were observed for melting temperature. For 8 % of ?-

tocopherol, the Tg decrease 11 K, indicating that ??tocopherol behaves as a plasticizant, 

i.e. increasing the mobility of PLA chains in the amorphous regions, thus allowing more 

rearrangements of polymer chains and consequently higher crystallinity. Piorkowska et 

al.
62

 have obtained a similar result when PLA was plasticized with poly(propylene glycol), 

PPG.  

In what concerns the glass transition temperature, a decrease of 11 K for when to 8 wt 

% of ?-tocopherol content into the film was observed. Overall, the antioxidants 

incorporation into PLA increases the free volume of the polymer matrix and consequently 

promotes the enhancement of polymer chain mobility. Therefore, these antioxidants 

possibly act as plasticizers in the PLA matrix. It is well known that the addition of low 

molecular weight compounds decreases PLA rigidity and brittleness by reducing its glass 

transition temperature.
59

 The results obtained in this work for antioxidants concentrations 

above 2 wt % are in agreement with some works which demonstrate that PLA melting 

point shifts to lower temperatures with the addition of different plasticizers
59

, however the 

incorporation of only 2 wt % of each antioxidant into PLA films did not affect the melting 

temperature. Manzanares-López et al 
53

 and Jamshidian et al.
55

  found similar results 



44 

 

regarding the melting temperature after the incorporation of 2.58 wt% ?-tocopherol and 1 

wt% BHT, respectively, into PLA. However, the results here obtained contradict those of 

Jamshidian et al.
63

, who showed that the melting point of PLA decreases about 8 K with 

the incorporation of only 2 wt% ?-tocopherol. Table 6 presents a short summary of the 

effect of the antioxidants incorporation into PLA, by different processes. Films extruded 

are formed from the melted, whereas those formed by casting are from the solution. Then 

the results obtained from the first heating can be compared with the casting and the results 

obtained from the second heating can be compared with the extruded films.

2.3.5. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) 
 

Enriched films with antioxidants were crio-fractured in order to examine the 

microstructure aspects. Photomicrographs of blended films of PLA with 2 % of ?-

tocopherol fracture revealed formation of voids, considerable ductile tearing and 

inhomogeneity. PLA/BHT 2 wt% revealed absence of ductile tearing as in neat PLA and 

an integrity at the surface. PLA/TBHQ 2% wt revealed considerable ductile tearing, rough 

surface and integrity at the surface. Some powder grains can also be observed (Figure 27). 

BHT enriched films maintain the brittle failure of the PLA.   

 

Figure 27 – SEM micrographs of fracture surfaces of blends with 2 % of each antioxidant. 

 

The voids are present in the ?-tocopherol film with 5 % ?-tocopherol. However the film 

seems to be more homogeneous  than a previous sample with 2 % of ?-tocopherol (Figure 

28). A dramatically difference appears in TBHQ 5 wt% film, that revealed homogeneity, 

increase of ductile tearing and a completely smooth surface. The increase of TBHQ seems 



46 

 

to improve the compatibility with PLA. Both films are less bright, which can be due the 

less crystallinity. Films of PLA/BHT 5wt% revealed brittle failure, and the presence of 

some powder grains (Figure 29).

Finally, micrographs of PLA films enriched with 10 wt% of antioxidants are shown in 

Figure 30. The addition of large amounts of these antioxidants does not seem to improve 

the structural characteristics of the films, PLA/BHT seems now to be very homogeneous 

surface, indicating ductile tearing of the films. Films with 10 wt% of ?-tocopherol revealed 

inhomogeneity, formation of voids and absence of ductile tearing. This is an indication of 

phase separation due to incompatibility of the antioxidant with the PLA, and brittle failure. 

Very smooth films were formed by addition of TBHQ.  

 

 
 

Figure 30 – SEM micrographs of fracture surfaces /surfaces of blends with 10 % of each antioxidant. 

 

Figure 31 and Figure 32 show that at above a certain concentration an incompatibility, 

immiscibility, between the selected antioxidants occurs, due to the hydrophobic character 

of ?-tocopherol and BHT conferred by their hydrocarbon chains. These incompatibilities 

cause morphological changes in the PLA film structure, which can be clearly seen in the 

SEM micrographs.

In conclusion, TBHQ has better compatibility with PLA and its addition provides a 

significant flexural enhancement of PLA. The increase of crystallinity for high 

concentrations of ?-tocopherol should result from the phase separations, because the 

aggregates of ?-tocopherol trap the PLA and improve the interaction, promoting the 

crystals formation.

2.3.6. X-ray and AFM 
 

Figure 33 shows the X-ray diffraction data of neat PLA and enriched PLA with ?-

tocopherol. These films were not subject to a thermal treatment. Neat PLA exhibits a 

crystalline peak at 2? about 12º, which agree with data previously published with 

characteristic peaks at 2? about 12.5, 14.7, 16.6, 19.1 and 22.3 ºC.64 This peak vanish with 

the addition of ?-tocopherol, this seems to hinder the mobility of the chains of the polymer 

and consequently the formation of the crystals. The films containing ?-tocopherol 2 and 6 

wt % present a broad amorphous peak from PLA around 16º, confirming that PLA has an 

amorphous microstructure (Figure 34). From AFM observation, it can be concluded that 

the samples resultants of the addition of ?-tocopherol have a smoother surface compared 

with the uneven rough surface of neat PLA (Figure 35 and Figure 36). Since X-ray give us 

only results from whole volume of sample, the AFM was used as complementary analysis, 

because showing only the surface image. The combination of both techniques allows to 

conclude where the ordered crystalline phase is, and in the case of neat PLA is placed 

deeper, i.e., into internal layers of films. The smoothness of the surface films containing 

antioxidant may be due to its plasticizer effect.

2.3.7. Contact angles and surface energy 
 

 

The water contact angle value measured on the pure PLA film (65º) is in good agreement 

with the literature, which ranges from 69º to 87º.
59

 The enhancement of the hydrophobic 

character of the PLA film surface with the antioxidants incorporation was clearly shown by 

the increase of water contact angles from 76.5º to the highest value 98.5º for PLA-10 wt% 

?-tocopherol. This increment can be attributed to the hydrophobic nature of each 

antioxidant and demonstrates the decreased wettability of PLA films by the antioxidants 

incorporation. Jamshidian et al.

 observed exactly the same behaviour for PLA-BHT and 

PLA-TBHQ films, but with less pronounced effects since only 1 wt.% of antioxidant was 

added. Moreover, Hwang et al. 
56

 also concluded that the water contact angles of PLA 

films additivated with both AT and revesratrol slightly increase when compared to that of 

neat PLA films. Table 7 lists the average contact angle (?) of water deposited onto PLA 

films surface.

 As can be seen in Table 7, no significant changes were observed in the 

surface energy of PLA-BHT and PLA-TBHQ films when compared to pure PLA. On the 

other hand, the surface energy of the ?-tocopherol/PLA films decreases with the ?-

tocopherol content essentially due to the reduction of the polar component, which can be 

linked to the non-polar aliphatic chain of this natural antioxidant.

2.4. Conclusion 

 
Addition effects of ?-tocopherol, BHT and TBHQ on physical, mechanical, structural 

and morphological properties of solvent-casted PLA films were studied. Enriched films 

with ?-tocopherol became yellowish, which is not desirable in terms of consumer 

acceptability. SEM images of membranes enriched with BHT show that the miscibility of 

BHT and PLA was not good, and the powder agglomerates increase with the BHT content 

increase. PLA/BHT 2 wt% membranes revealed a cohesive structure with brittleness 

failure. The method used to produce enriched films with ?-tocopherol needs to be 

improved since the membranes revealed inhomogeneity at lower concentration and for 

higher concentrations phase separation occurs. TBHQ seems to be the best antioxidant, 

because the films were transparent, smooth, with good flexibility (visible evaluation). 

However, this antioxidant decreases the crystallinity, and as we know, reduction of 

crystallinity is a negative point regarding mechanical and barrier properties. This was the 

only antioxidant that seems to improve the thermal stability, despite the reduction of the 

crystallinity. Membranes obtained with 2 wt% of TBHQ revealed some powder. However, 

for higher contents of TBHQ no powder is visible and the flexibility increases, while the 

crystallinity remains constant. These conclusions are valid for concentration up to 10 wt%.

3.1. Introduction 
 

 

The piezoelectricity was first detected in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie. This 

property feature of some materials is based on an electric potential produced when a 

material, such as a quartz crystal, is subjected to mechanical stress. Piezoelectric crystal 

sensors are passive solid-state electronic devices, which can respond to changes in 

temperature, pressure, and most importantly, to changes in physical properties at the 

interface between the device surface and a foreign fluid or solid. Such changes in physical 

properties include variation in interfacial mass density, elasticity, viscosity, and layer 

thickness.
65

 The incorporation of various chemically sensitive layers has enabled the 

transition from the microbalance to the mass sensor and gave rise to an explosive growth 

of piezoelectric sensors in recent years. This type of sensor operates by observation of the 

propagation of an acoustic wave through the solid-state device. Sensing is achieved by  

correlating acoustic wave-propagation variations to the amount of analyte captured at the 

surface and then to the amount or concentration of analyte present in the sample exposed to 

the sensor, or to the changes of physical properties of interfacial thin films.
65

 A selective 

sensor is obtained when a sensor surface is coated with a selectively interacting thin film.
65

 

This sensor principle employing bulk acoustic waves (BAW) was introduced by King
65

 in 

1964 with the construction of his piezoelectric sorption detector.
65

 There are two types of 

piezoelectric crystal sensors: the AT-cut quartz crystal sensor using BAW, the other is 

based on surface waves (SAW) device (Figure 37). 
65

 

In 1959, Sauerbrey introduced a new method for mass measurements, using the 

change in the frequency of a quartz resonator to measure the mass of a film adherently 

deposited on the quartz resonator surface.
66

 The Sauerbrey’s mass measuring instrument 

was named quartz crystal microbalance, QCM.
66

 QCM is a thickness-shear-mode acoustic 

wave sensor, generally used as a microgravimetric sensor. A thin mass layer deposited on 

the surface of the quartz crystal can be measured according to the decrease of the resonant 

frequency. The frequency is the most accurately quantity that can be measured, of the order 

of ?f/f0=10
-7, 

10
-8

, which corresponds to a mass of the order of a nanogram
 
in the case of 

standard QCMs of 9 MHz.
67

  The decrease of the resonant frequency of a thickness shear 



57 

 

vibrating quartz crystal resonator, having AT or BT cut (AT or BT expressed the 

crystallographic orientations of the quartz resonator), is proportional to the added mass of 

the deposited film:

This treatment is rigorously valid only for infinitesimally thin films that have an 

acoustic impedance (for shear waves) close to that of quartz, conditions that are valid for a 

fairly rigid, firmly attached thin films.
68

  

Schrag et al 
68

, developed theoretical models to predict the mechanical response of 

a model quartz crystal microbalance to viscoelastic thin layer. Special care should be taken 



58 

 

so that the Sauerbray equation is valid, meaning that the added mass needs to be evenly 

distributed over the electrodes and is much smaller than the mass of the quartz disk, ?f/f 

&lt;&amp;lt;1.
70   

These conditions are important since it is known that the moisture or vapors 

absorbed in the coating makes it less rigid, allowing for deviations from the well-known 

Sauerbrey expression. A critical term, ?1D (? is related to the shear wavelength ?s and D 

the thickness of sample layer), can be used to determine deviations from ideal behaviour 

equations (3) and (4).

3.2. Gas/Vapor Sorption Models 
 

 

The sorption of a gas in a polymer film can display a variety of behaviours. There 

are three main types of vapour sorption isotherms in glassy polymers, as shown in Figure 

38. The concentration of penetrant gas/vapour is represented in the y-axis and the activity 

of the gas in the x-axis. 



59 

 

 

 

Figure 38 – vapour sorption isotherms in glassy polymers.
76

 

 

Type 1 is concave towards the activity axis at low activities and almost linear at 

higher activities Figure 38a). Most of the vapour sorption isotherms in glassy polymers 

display Type 1 diagrams.
76

 Type 2, usually referred to as BET type II, is a sigmoidal 

isotherm, which is concave towards the abscissa at low activities and convex at high 

activities, as illustrated in Figure 38b). There is an inflection point in the isotherm. Many 

vapour sorption isotherms in glassy polymers also display this behaviour.
76

 Type 3 is 

always convex towards the activity axis, as shown in Figure 38c). Only a few of vapour 

sorption isotherms in glassy polymers belong to this type.
76

  

Depending on the specific characteristics of the vapour-polymer system, different 

mathematical models have been proposed to describe and analyse the sorption results 

obtained. The interpretation of the sorption phenomena based on these models may lead to 

interesting conclusions since the model coefficients are usually linked to properties that 

have a role in the sorption mechanism. In particular, the dual-mode sorption model 

(DMSM) has been widely used to correlate the solubility of gases in glassy polymers films. 

This model assumes that sorption takes place by two distinct modes: one that follows the 

Henry’s law and the other a Langmuir adsorption isotherm.
77

 Analytically, these two 

contributions can be given by equation (5):  

 

HD
CC += C                                                                                                                                                   (5)

k  is the Henry’s law dissolution constant; b is the microvoid affinity constant;

C? is

While DMSM has encountered an enormous success in the description of gas or 

vapour sorption isotherms concave towards the activity axis, only the engaged species 

induced clustering (ENSIC) model is able to describe isotherms convex towards the 

activity or pressure axis.
78

 The model considers the probability of insertion of one non-

polymeric solute molecule (e.g. gas, vapour or solvent) in a polymer/solvent matrix 

containing only two types of species (i.e. the polymer and the sorbed molecule), one (the 

polymer) being present only in the condensed phase.
78

 The sorption process of a molecule 

in the vapour phase is governed by its intrinsic affinity for either a polymer segment (kp) or 

an already sorbed solvent molecule (ks) (Figure 39). 



61 

 

 

 

Figure 39 – Basic sorption mechanism according to the ENSIC model. Insertion of a solvent molecule (? ) in 

the polymer (?) / solvent matrix is governed by the two elementary insertion probabilities ks and kp.
78

 

 

Neither the DMSM nor the ENSIC models enable the prediction of the isotherm 

shape given in Figure 38b), because both models are unable in mathematically modelling 

sigmoidal curves.  

To describe sigmoidal sorption isotherms, Feng, H.
76

 reported the modelling of 

vapour sorption in glassy polymers using a new dual mode sorption model. Besides 

describing the two mechanisms previously referred, the new model can simultaneously 

describe sigmoidal isotherms which could only be addressed by Guggenheim-Anderson-de 

Boer (GAB) model.
76

 The underlying sorption mechanism can be explained as a 

contribution of two sorption phenomena, one of which occurs in the matrix region and the 

other in the microvoids (Figure 40).

sum of both mechanisms given by equation (9):

The new dual mode sorption has three parameters, pC , 
'

k  and 
'

A , as many as the 

conventional dual mode sorption. As shown in the Figure 41, the sorption occurs in two 

modes or distinct places of the film: i) in the matrix region of the glassy polymers, given 

by the first term in equation (9) described by a downward curve similar to that of sorption 

in rubbery polymers; ii) in the microvoids, give by the second term in equation (9), 

described by an upward curve.  

 



63 

 

 

Figure 41 – Schematic representation of the new DMS model.
76

 

 

The total amount of vapour molecules in the glassy polymers is equal to the sum of the two 

different sorption modes.
76

 In both modes, pC  is the weight value of the sorption capacity 

of the polymer to the sorbate, gas or vapour and it mainly depends on the structure and 

physical state of the polymer and on the volume of the sorbate; 
'

k is the difference between 

the interaction of vapour molecules among themselves and the interactions between the 

vapour molecules and the polymer molecule segment; large 
'

k  values indicate strong 

interactions between the sorbate and the polymer; 
'

A  is a measure of interactions between 

the sorbate molecule and the microvoid. ( )kA ?? 1'  is a measure of the affinity between the 
vapour and the microvoid of the polymer.

3.3. Overview 
 

In contrast to glass or metal packaging materials, packages made with plastic are 

permeable at different degrees to small molecules like gases, water vapor, and organic 

vapor and to other low molecular weight compounds like aromas, flavor, and additives 

present into food. As a consequence of the barrier properties of the material, the transfer of 

this molecules ranges from high to low.
80

 Transport of gases, vapors and liquids through 

polymers is an important in some cases, controlling factor in several application such as 



64 

 

protective coatings, membrane separation processes and packaging of foods and 

beverages.
81

 It is important to know if there is interaction between food and packaging and 

consequently to well understand the factors that can influence the transport mechanism 

through the material. The knowledge of the sorption/diffusion/permeation behaviors of 

these molecules through the polymer film has become more and more important in recent 

years, especially for polymers used in the food packaging field where contamination from 

external environment has to be avoided.
80

 For the food industry a precise knowledge of O2 

and CO2 sorption properties by the packaging is particularly important for product quality 

for the development of plastics and coatings for bottles. PLA films impregnated with 

antioxidants have been recently studied
52–55,63,82,83

 

The effect of the antioxidants in the gas barrier properties of PLA, were not well 

investigated before, as well as the transport mechanisms. So, in this chapter we will present 

the sorption results of oxygen and carbon dioxide in PLA films enriched with ?-

tocopherol, BHT and TBHQ. Not less important than to establish the mechanisms and 

laws, relating solubility and transport in polymer membranes, of small molecules, is to 

study the influence of the size and shape of penetrant molecule in the sorption. While 

smaller permeants will have a greater diffusion coefficient, the polymer will be less 

plasticized, whereas the lower diffusion coefficient of the larger permeants will be 

compensated for the higher degree of sorption.
81

 In the second part of this chapter, we will 

present the sorption results of flavors in PLA films with different thermal treatments, an 

area were few data are available. The main objective was to study the effect of the flavor 

size on sorption. Finally, we come back at the study of the solubility of ethylene in PLA 

films. Oliveira et al
73

 reported the sorption of ethylene, in PLA films, regarding the 

ethylene as a gas can be released into the package from fruits, vegetables and flowers, 

which, if were sensitive to ethylene,  when exposed to it, can ripen or mature quicker. 

Despite the nonpolar nature of the ethylene, we found that there is moderate interaction 

with PLA. At the time, has being developed membranes with group ester which had 

performance characteristics suitable for the separation of ethane/ethylene. We explore a 

little a new area that could use PLA membranes, where their poor properties barrier and 

their lack of flexibility could be useful.

3.4.1. Materials 
 

Oxygen with 99.995 % and carbon dioxide with 99.999% were from Air Liquid. 

Ethyl Acetate with 99.8% and butyl Acetate with 99.5 % of purity were purchased from 

Aldrich and were used with no further purification. Ethane with 99.99% and Ethylene with 

99.5 % of purity were purchased from Aldrich. Solvent and gases were used with no 

further purification. PLA and antioxidants were previously described. 

Quartz crystals of 9 MHz base frequency, with silver or gold electrodes were 

supplied by Euroquartz, Ltd. 

 

3.4.2. Quartz crystal coating 
 

The sorption of oxygen and carbon dioxide in PLA and PLA enriched with ?-

tocopherol, BHT and TBHQ films was measured using the QCM technique. Among the 

methods used to prepare thin film samples for the QCM, the drop coating method proved 

to be successful in our previous studies,
74

 was used. The QCM apparatus used in this work 

to measure gas solubility in PLA films has been thoroughly described by Oliveira.
84

 In this 

apparatus, the two 9 MHz quartz crystals used, with active area of 0.25 cm
2
 were carefully 

cleaned with dichloromethane until the base frequency became constant (± 2 Hz). The 

measuring crystal was then coated with a thin polymer film, which was prepared by 

dropping a diluted solution on both sides of the quartz crystal electrode surface. The 

frequency change to the polymer layer after thermal treatment at 190 ºC during 10 minutes 

followed by fast cooling in a freezer (15 min) was 99.391 Hz for PLA; 70.404 Hz for PLA 

with 2.2 % ?-tocopherol; 105.907 Hz for PLA with 4.4 % ?-tocopherol; 83.313 Hz for 

PLA with 4.4 % TBHQ and 66.836 HZ for PLA with 4.4 % BHT. SEM images show that 

the thermal treatment is very important to improve the morphological structure. For 

example, dropping in a quartz crystal a solution with about 6 wt% of ?-tocopherol in PLA, 

and carried out the thermal treatment for one of them,  and the other was analyzed without 

any treatment, the results are shown in Figure 42. Thin films formed from the melted do 



66 

 

not have pores and are homogeneous. AFM images of a thin film of neat PLA is shown in 

Figure 43.

Once again, it is clearly the existence of pores in membranes without thermal treatment.  

AFM images of melted thin films with 2 wt% and 4 wt% of ?-tocopherol in PLA, revealed 

a roughness structure increase with the antioxidant amount present in the film. Large voids 

are present for PLA content 4 wt% of tocopherol. The voids that had appeared in 

membranes without thermal treatment vanished.

3.4.3. Mass measurements using QCM 
 

Two AT-cut Quartz crystals were use to perform the sorption measurements with a 

QCM apparatus: the measuring crystal coated with a thin layer of the polymer under study 

and the reference crystal, uncoated crystal, connected to an oscillator have been placed 

inside a solubility cell, which is placed inside a thermostatic water bath. The sorption 

measurements start by evacuating the apparatus until the frequency of both crystals are 

constant at a desired temperature. The gas or flavor, previously thermostatized is admitted 

into the solubility cell, promoting a change in the frequency of both crystals. The 

frequency change is monitored as a function of time until sorption equilibrium has been 

achieved, i.e. until a stable frequency is reached. Several pressures of the gas up to 1 bar 

have been studied and in the case of aromas, vapour pressures up to 10 % of saturated 

vapour pressure have been studied, using a heated Ceravac Transmiter, CTR 91 model, 

which have a measurement uncertainty of 0.2 % of reading ± temperature effect (0.01 of 

reading at span level and 0.005 of full scale at zero level). 

If the polymer film is uniformly spread and vibrates synchronously with the quartz 

crystal, the frequency of the wave is a function of the coated mass, according to the 

equation (2). When gas, or solvent, is injected into the system, the frequencies of both 

crystals change. This frequency change is a sum of three independent terms: hydrostatic, 

impedance and sorption. The first two terms are measured together using the reference 

crystal. For each temperature and pressure, the frequencies of the coated and uncoated 

crystal were experimentally measured and their difference is proportional to the mass of 

the coating, polymer and gas, sorbed in it. Thus, the solubility of the gas in polymer, C, 

was calculated according to the following equation:

where ?pol. is the polymer density, ?FC represents the total mass of polymer coated on the 

quartz crystal and is determined by the difference in the oscillation frequency measured 

before coating and after the thermal treatment of the crystal with the coating. ?FS is 

calculated from the frequency change due to gas sorption between the reference crystal

3.5. Oxygen and Carbon dioxide Sorption in antioxidants 

Poly(lactic acid) films 

 

As mentioned before, the PLA has been intensively researched in an attempt to 

improve its barrier and mechanical properties which prevent its use in the food packaging 

industry and in the field of hygiene. In the last 5 years, the studies have been based on 

demand for non-toxic compounds which can be blended with PLA and its effect on thermal 

and mechanical properties of the final blended package. In Table 8 can be found a few 

studies were natural and synthetic antioxidants were impregnated in polymers used in food 

packaging and was adapted from Ref. 55 . As happened with others polymers also in PLA 

the main objective of the most studies were rates, effects, and mechanism of antioxidants’ 

release.

3.5.1. Sorption Results 
 

 

  The oxygen and carbon dioxide sorption in PLA and enriched PLA films with ?-

tocopherol, were measured using the QCM. The sorption results obtained and their relative 

standard deviation are presented in Table 9 for oxygen and in Table 10 for carbon dioxide.  

An example of the equilibrium sorption isotherms behaviour at 283 K is depicted in 

Figure 46. For both gases the sorption increases over the entire pressure range for all three 

films. The CO2 sorption in the three films exhibits the dual mode sorption nature as 

typically observed for glassy polymers. The O2 sorption follows a predominant Henry 

behaviour for the PLA, while the ?-tocopherol enriched films present a convex behaviour 

towards the pressure axis, which is generally found for vapour sorption in polymers.

75 

 

This different behaviour has led to the choice of an alternative model to describe the 

sorption isotherms: the new DMSM, described by equation (9) was used to correlate the O2 

sorption results, while for the CO2 isotherms the performance of both models, the classical 

DMSM represented by equation (8) and the new DMSM, was evaluated in terms of the 

average absolute deviation, AAD. The estimated model parameters are reported in Table 

11 and Table 12 for oxygen and carbon dioxide, respectively.

Although both models can provide an adequate representation of the CO2 sorption data, 

the correct representation of the O2 sorption isotherms can only be achieved when the new 

DMSM is used. As it was mentioned before, the model parameters can be used for 

interpretation of the sorption phenomena and provide relevant information about the 

system under study.

The A’ values are also 3-5 times higher for CO2 revealing that this gas has higher 

affinity to the microvoids than O2, and most probably the CO2 sorption occurs to a large 

extent in microvoids. Surprisingly, the k´ parameter has very similar values for the two 

gases, leading to the conclusion that the magnitude of the interaction polymer-sorbate is 

similar in both cases. Nevertheless, the convex behaviour of the oxygen isotherms 

indicates that there is a strong specific interaction between the molecules and the glassy 

PLA, fact that does not happen for CO2.  

Another form to evaluate the underlying sorption mechanism is through the use the 

infinite-dilution sorption, S0, expressed by

S0 gives an indication of whether a gas molecule prefers to dissolve in the polymer 

matrix or sorbs into microvoids and can help to understand the effect of ?-tocopherol on 

the gas access to microvoids. In Figure 47 the weight of Langmuir capacity, SH0 = Cp(A’-1)k’, 

on total solubility for O2 and CO2 is reported. The most important conclusion is that the 

sorption mechanism of both gases in PLA is not affected by the presence of ?-tocopherol: 

the sorption of CO2 occurs essentially in microvoids while the O2 solubilizes mostly in the 

polymer matrix. For CO2 the Langmuir capacity is roughly the same (around 80 %) for the 

three films in the studied temperature interval. The O2 sorption presents an almost constant 

Langmuir capacity of about 20 % for PLA and 4 % enriched PLA films in the all 

temperature range, while values around 40 % are observed for the 2 % enriched film.

The product Cpk’ can also yield valuable information regarding the sorption 

mechanism since it is related to the sorption sites and the properties of the penetrant. This 

product is presented for each isotherm for both gases in Figure 48. The difference in 



78 

 

magnitude of CpK’ between the two studied gases reflects the CO2 higher polarity and 

condensability relatively to O2. It is also interesting to observe the change in relative 

magnitude of CpK’ for PLA and PLA 4.4 % enriched films below, at and above the CO2 

critical temperature (304.1 K) .
55

 Note that this type of data does not allow us to infer about 

what happens at the molecular level about the role of ?-tocopherol in the sorption of the 

two studied gases.

Figure 48 -  CpK’ results for O2 and CO2 to the PLA and enriched PLA. 

 

For CO2 the unexpected behaviour for the 2.2% (w/w) enriched films is captured by the 

model parameters, where CpK’ is consistently lower than what would be expected from the 

values for the 4.4 % (w/w) enriched films for each gas. As shown previously in Figure 47, 

the presence of ?-tocopherol in PLA films only influences the O2 solubility which displays 

an increasing sorption with the ?-tocopherol content. The CO2 solubility in PLA and PLA 

enriched films with 4.4 % of ?-tocopherol is roughly the same, while the CO2 solubility in 

enriched films with 2.2 % of ?-tocopherol is always lower. Since the sorption of CO2 takes 

place predominantly in the microvoids, the ?-tocopherol content seems to somehow affect 

their size and distribution in 2.2 % (w/w) enriched PLA film.  



79 

 

Finally, the enthalpy change due the sorption of the gas was analyzed. Figure 49 shows 

the sorption behaviour with temperature at 1 bar for both CO2 and O2. The enthalpy of 

sorption, ?HS, for both gases in PLA and enriched PLA films was obtained using the van’t 

Hoff relationship. The error bars are the 95 % confidence interval of the mean obtained 

from at least three independent values of solubility. The t student was obtained to (n-1) 

degrees of freedom.
95

 The sorption process is exothermic for both gases. The ?HS values 

obtained for CO2 in PLA and PLA enriched films with 2.2 % and 4.4 % ?-tocopherol are 

almost constant -24.1 (±0.1) kJ/mol, -23.2 (±0.1) kJ/mol and -21.9 (±0.2) kJ/mol 

respectively, indicating again that the presence of ?-tocopherol does not affect the 

energetics of CO2 sorption. Nevertheless, the ?HS values obtained for O2 in PLA enriched 

films with 0 %, 2.2 % and 4.4 % ?-tocopherol are -15.1 (±0.1) kJ/mol, -11.9 (±0.1) kJ/mol 

and -6.6 (±0.2) kJ/mol,
 
respectively, show that the sorption of oxygen is clearly affected by 

the increasing concentration of ?-tocopherol, in agreement with the sorption results, 

rendering a less exothermic processes.

as it is for TBHQ, and for this film we did not detect this anomalous behavior.

3.5.2. Conclusions 

 

 
Sorption results of oxygen and carbon dioxide in melted PLA with and without ?-

tocopherol show that oxygen sorption increases with the ?-tocopherol content and the 

convex shape of the isotherms indicates a strong interaction gas-polymer. The sorption 

mechanism for both gases remains unchanged with the addition of ?-tocopherol: the 

sorption of oxygen occurs essentially in polymer matrix, whereas the carbon dioxide 

solubilises mostly in the microvoids. Enriched films with 4 wt% of TBHQ show a slight 

increase in the solubility of oxygen, but the same concentration of BHT decreases to about 

half the solubility value obtained for neat PLA at 303 K. As expected, the oxygen 

solubility of neat PLA and PLA/TBHQ films decrease with the temperature. An anomalous 

behaviour occurs for enriched membranes with 4 wt% of ?-tocopherol and BHT, for which 

the solubility increases at the temperature of 313 K. This behaviour may be due to the 

proximity of the Tg, and the chain of the polymer acquire some mobility that promote 

rearranges, improve the free volume and consequently lead to  oxygen solubility increase.

3.6. Ethyl Acetate and Butyl Acetate sorption in Poly(lactic 

acid) films 

 

3.6.1. Introduction 
 

 

Food packaging in recent years has experienced rapid advances and continuous 

growth due to consumer demand for conveniently packaged products. This has promoted a 

trend in packaging materials that has evolved from simple food wraps to sophisticated 

containers. Besides providing an adequate shelf life and product quality, it is desirable that 

the packaging material also participates in the overall flavor management of the packaged 

food, since flavor is an underlying factor in the consumer acceptability of all food 

products.
96

 However, the sorption of food aromas, particularly by packaging materials, is 

usually perceived as a major factor contributing to the quality alteration of most foods 

during storage.
96

 This causes changes in both the intensity and characteristics of the food 

flavors owing to their sorption by the packaging material, a phenomenon commonly 

referred to as “scalping”. Flavor scalping is a term used in the packaging industry to 

describe the loss of quality of a packaged item due to either its volatile flavors being 

absorbed by the package or the food absorbing undesirable flavors from the packaging 

material.
96

 The sorption of food constituents, especially aroma compounds, by polymeric 

packaging materials has received considerable attention during the past decade, and is 

generally considered to be a problem within the food packaging industry.
97

  

There are innumerous publications about transport of small molecules as gases (O2, 

CO2) or water through flexible food packaging, including in PLA. However, the barrier 

properties of PLA against aroma compounds have been the subject of only a few studies. 

Aroma compounds are very important among the volatile molecules that can 

interact with packaging materials, but these interactions are much more complex than the 

interactions between packaging and gases or water molecules.
34

 Several factors can 

influence the transfer of aroma compounds through food packaging as, the package itself, 

the chemical structure of the aromatic compound, the environment and the food matrix.
34

 

Food packaging interactions, defined as an interplay between food, packaging, and the 

environment, can produce an adverse effect on the food and/or the package.
96

 



83 

 

Interactions between the plastic package and the flavor constituents can cause 

adsorption and absorption of flavor volatiles by the packaging material, permeation of the 

flavor volatiles through the plastic material, food- and flavor-induced changes in the 

physical properties of the plastic polymer, as well as interactions of low-molecular-weight 

compounds in the plastic such as solvent and plastifiers with the food flavor or the food 

itself, thereby resulting in an overall imbalance in the flavor profile of the food.
96

 Figure 52 

shows the possible interactions between foodstuff, polymer film, and the environment and 

their adverse consequences.
96

 Flavor losses that result from interaction with the polymer 

package can be either losse occurring by permeation or migration through the package or 

those from sorption by the container.
96

 

 

 

Figure 52 – Possible interactions between foodstuff, polymer film, and the environment and their adverse 

consequences.
96

 

Among the parameters that may influence the mass transfer of aroma compounds, 

Tg of the polymer film can affect in a more important way the sorption by polymer than 

crystallinity. Indeed, flavor sorption in rubbery polymers (OPP or LDPE) can be several 

thousand times higher than in glassy polymers (PET, PC, PEN), even if the crystallinity 

percentage is the most important factor in rubbery polymers.
98

 Nevertheless, among glassy 

polymers, flavor sorption is more important for the less crystalline polymer. In some cases, 

no effect of Tg could be seen on gas transfer. It is argued that perhaps the number of holes 

does not greatly change above Tg but mainly the size of the holes changes, i.e., the 



84 

 

amplitude of the segmental oscillations or rotations increases. If penetrant molecules are 

small enough, only minor changes would be displayed because the probability of a 

penetrant molecule encountering a hole would remain roughly the same. With larger 

penetrant molecules, the size becomes important and effect of the glass transition can be 

seen.
34

  

The state of aroma compounds (liquid or vapor), as well as this physicochemical 

properties such as molecular weight, structure, hydrophobicity, and polarity, have an 

important effect on the affinity for the polymeric matrix (sorption) and also on the transfer 

kinetics (diffusion). For example, concerning the molecular weight of the aroma, its  

solubility increases with their boiling point of the a homologous series of ethyl esters (C2 

to C6), whereas diffusivity decreases with molecular weight. The saturated vapor pressure 

of aroma compounds decreases with the increase in their boiling point, which is related to 

the increase in their molecular weight, thus making their sorption easier in the polymer 

film.
34

 However, it is also reported that sorption of n-alkanes, n-aldehydes, n-alcohols, and 

aliphatic ethylesters (C4 to C12) in PE increases linearly up to ten carbon atoms.
34

 For  

heavier sorbates (C12), the solubility reaches a plateau. Concerning diffusion, as the 

molecular weight or molar volume of the aroma molecules increases, the steric hindrance 

in the polymeric matrix increases and the need for free volume as well. Short-chain esters 

(C8 to C12) diffuse much faster through a PVC film than the longer-chain ones (C14 to C18) 

at 50°C.
34

 Moreover, methyl esters diffuse faster than ethyl esters at the same conditions 

because the steric hindrance of the ethyl group is higher. Consequently, the depth of 

penetration of methyl esters into PVC decreases with their chain length.
34

 Diffusion 

generally decreases linearly for aroma compounds up to about ten carbon atoms. For 

heavier molecules, diffusion behavior changes according to the chemical structure of the  

aroma compounds.
34

 

Concerning the chemical structure of the aroma compound molecules, linear 

molecules sorb more easily in the polymeric matrix than cyclic molecules because their 

molar volume is smaller. The effect of the size and structure of the aroma molecules is 

more important for a polymeric matrix in the glassy state than in the rubbery state. Indeed, 

sorption of linear primary alcohol molecules (C2 to C4) in EVOH increases with sorbate 

molar volume below polymer Tg (glassy state) and decreases above polymer Tg (rubbery 



85 

 

state). The effect is even more important when the experimental temperature is far from the 

polymer Tg.
34

 

The sorption behavior of aroma compounds in a polymeric matrix depends on a 

great extent on the relative polarity and hydrophobicity of the polymer-aroma system. The 

octanol-water partition coefficient (P) is the parameter usually taken to evaluate 

hydrophobicity, and is defined as the partition coefficient of the aroma compound between 

octanol and water usually expressed on a log scale (logP). Hydrophilic molecules have 

negative logP values (around ?1.5 for diacetyl), while hydrophobic molecules have 

positive logP values (around 2.8 for ethyl hexanoate). Polarity is the distribution of electric 

charges in a molecule and is generally characterized by the dielectric constant (?, 

adimensional). The dielectric constant of ethyl hexanoate is about 4, whereas a value of  

around 80 is obtained for water.
34

 The chemical families of aroma compounds are usually 

classified regarding their decreasing polarity: acids, alcohols, esters, ethers, aldehydes, 

ketones, aromatic hydrocarbons, unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, and saturated 

aliphatic hydrocarbons.
34

 Aroma compounds are sorbed more easily in a polymeric matrix 

if polarity or dielectric constant of both the compound and the matrix are close.
34

 It was 

observed while studying absorption of hexanal, decanal, carvone and limonene in OPP and 

PET after 14 days contact in solution at 40 °C, the more polar aroma molecules (aldehydes 

and carvone) are more sorbed into PET (moderately polar polymer) than in OPP (apolar 

polymer).
34

 On the other hand, limonene, a more apolar and hydrophobic aroma compound 

is more easily sorbed in OPP than in PET. When the difference of dielectric constant 

between a polymer and an aroma compound decreases, vapor sorption of the aroma 

compound into the polymer increases. Limonene sorption (? = 2.30) into polyethylene (? = 

2.26) is thus higher than hexanol sorption (? = 13.30).
34

 Table 13 shows the properties of 

PLA and others polymers commonly used for food packaging.
99

 Polymers such as PET,  

PC, and PLA have a Tg above ambient temperature (67 ºC, 149 ºC and 60 ºC, 

respectively).

The aim of this section was to measure PLA sorption for two organic compounds: 

ethyl acetate and butyl acetate (Figure 53), with dielectric constant of 6.0 and 5.0 at 303 K, 

respectively.
100

 Nevertheless, since aroma compounds are mainly hydrophobic molecules, 

PLA seems to be a promising material with efficient aroma barrier properties comparable 

to PET.
101

 However, some small hydrophilic molecules can also be used in the food 

industry. Ethyl acetate is a natural compound and is environmentally safe and acceptable 

for food applications, such as booster and enhancer for fruit aroma. Ethyl acetate is the 

most hydrophilic aroma compound in the homologous series of the ethyl esters, and it was 

chosen here in order to test the performance of PLA in a rather unfavourable case. Butyl 

acetate is used in food industry as a component in synthetic flavours and also as a diluents 

for dyes in inks for marking vegetables and fruits. Butyl acetate is found in many types of 

fruits, where along with other chemicals it imparts characteristic flavors and has a sweet 

smell of banana or apple. It is used as a synthetic fruit flavoring candy, ice cream, cheeses, 

and baked goods. This compounds was chosen to evaluate the effect of incrementing the 

ethyl acetate molecule by two carbon atoms. 

 

 

 

Figure 53 – Chemical structures of the flavours used in this work. 

 

 



87 

 

Auras et al 
102

 showed that PLA has a very good barrier to d-limonene, a 

hydrophobic aroma compound found in orange juice. However, the sorption of ethyl 

acetate in PLA is approximately twice than in PET, PP and LDPE.  

 

 

3.6.2. Sorption Results and Discussion 
 

 

The flavour sorption was carried out in quartz crystals coated with the neat PLA 

film which were submitted to two distinct thermal treatments: the melting and the 

annealing treatment. The first, consists in heating the coated crystal from ambient 

temperature up to 523 K, at 2 K/min, and cool it down to ambient temperature at 10 K/min. 

In the annealing treatment, the crystal is introduced into an oven at 336 K, slightly above 

the glassy transition temperature, for two days, cooled to room temperature for one day and 

introduced again into the oven at 336 K for one day more. The total mass of polymer 

coated on the quartz crystal is determined by difference in the oscillation frequency 

measured before coating and after the thermal treatment.  

Figure 54 shows the frequency change, ?F, when both crystals, uncoated and 

coated with melted PLA, were subject at an ethyl acetate vapour pressure at 283 K, 293 K 

and 403 K. It is important to have a linear relationship between mass and frequency change 

in range of pressures studied, so that the Sauerbrey equation can be confidently used.

Figure 55 – Ethyl acetate sorption isotherms for temperatures between 293-303 K for ethyl acetate en PLA. 

The lines represent the new dual mode sorption model. 

 

At 293 K the sorption isotherm of ethyl acetate in PLA is linear up to a relative pressure of 

0.4. At 303 K and 313 K the sorption isotherms are convex towards the relative vapour 

pressure axis, at higher vapour activities. At high penetrant activities, the convex form is 

usually described for semi-crystalline polymers in their rubbery state, such as hydrophobic 

polymers in contact with organic compounds, and have been described predominantly 

using the Flory-Huggins or the engaged species induced clustering (ENSIC) model.
101

 The 

formation of ethyl acetate clusters in the polymer film may be the reason why the sorption 

of ethyl acetate greatly increase for high activities of the aroma.  

 Table 14 and Table 15 list the estimated values of the parameters and the fitting 

efficiencies of the new DMS and DMSM models, respectively. The sum of squares due to 

error (SSE) and R

It is shown that the new DMS model agrees better with the experimental sorption data than 

the DMSM model. As mentioned before, the new DMS model for vapour sorption in 

glassy polymers assumes that two types of sorption contribute to the penetrant 

concentration in glassy polymers: one taking place in the matrix region of the glassy 

polymer responsible for the downward curve similar to that observed for rubbery 

polymers; the other occurring in the microvoids responsible for an upward curve.

The pC  is the weighted mean value of the sorption capacity of the polymer to the 

vapour and it mainly depends on the structure and the state of the polymer. We can observe 

that this factor increases sharply with temperature. Therefore, the melted PLA sorption 

capacity for ethyl acetate increases with temperature. Along with this behaviour for pC , 

the decrease of A' with temperature, from values greater than 1 at 293 K to approximately 

1 at 303 K, can be observed. Meanwhile, k' slightly increases in the temperature interval 

from 293 to 303 K, and remains constant at higher temperatures. At 303 K, the pC  value 

obtained for the  annealed PLA is lower than that of melted PLA. Interestingly, k’ and A’ 

are close to 1 for both films from 303 K onwards.

Figure 57 – pC  fitting parameter of the new DMS model as a function of temperature. 

 

 

The k’ parameter is related to the interactions between the vapour molecules and the 

polymer segment. A large k’ indicates stronger interaction between the vapour and 

polymer, i.e., a large amount of sorbed vapour molecules in the polymer. The results 

obtained in this work show that ethyl acetate sorbes strongly in the PLA, regardless of the 

state of the polymer, melted or annealed. Moreover, the interactions established are not 

temperature dependent, since only a slight deviation from linearity is observed for this 

parameter in the studied temperature range. Since A’ is a measure of the interaction of the 

vapor molecule and the microvoids, it can be concluded that only at 293 K there is affinity 

between the vapor and the microvoids of the polymer. At higher temperatures A’ is equal 

to the unity, indicating that the polymer should be in its rubbery state. Since the Tg of 

melted PLA is 326 K, it should be in its glassy state at 293 K, 303 K and 313 K. Indeed, 

the melted PLA seems to be in the rubbery state at 303 K and 313 K, due to the shape of 

the sorption isotherms. This rubbery state is due to sorbed ethyl acetate, which acts as an 

effective PLA plasticizer, thus depressing the Tg of the polymer. Colomines et al 
9
 also 

reported that the sorption of ethyl acetate in PLA films can decrease the glass transition 



93 

 

temperature well below room temperature, to approximately 273 K. Due to the difficulties 

in controlling all the variables of the sorption apparatus, it was not possible to measure the 

sorption at 293 K and 313 K for annealed PLA. However, the study carried out at 303 K 

shows that this film is already in the rubbery state, as in the case of the melted PLA. For 

the same temperature, pC  is higher in the melted than annealed PLA, and the A’ values 

indicate that both polymers are in rubbery state. Then, why this difference? Initially, the 

melted PLA film has 10 % crystallinity, whereas the annealed PLA film has 20%. If 

microvoids are changed during/after of the sorption of ethyl acetate, the sorption capacity 

of the polymer films is altered. Indeed, solvent-induced phenomenon can increase the 

sample dimensions after the sorption of solvent due to swelling of the polymer, causing the 

release of internal stress bringing about more mobility of the polymer chains and enabling 

crystallization at low temperature.
9
 The chains of the melted polymer might have an 

additional facility to accommodate ethyl acetate molecules than annealed PLA. Another 

possible scenario is that the solvent-induced phenomenon can generate the appearance of 

crystallites in higher percentage for annealed PLA than melted PLA. This solvent induced 

crystallites has been described for the semi-crystalline polyester PET.
9
 Unfortunately it 

was not possible to measure the crystallinity before and after the film have been exposed to 

ethyl acetate, however, SEM images (Figure 58) show that there was breakage film after 

exposure to this flavor. Both these aspects can explain the higher capacity of the melted 

PLA film to sorb acetate molecules, as shown in Figure 59. 

 

  

Figure 58 - SEM images of the surfaces of PLA films before and after exposure at ethyl acetate.  



94 

 

 

  Since the size of the vapor molecule also has some influence on the sorption 

capacity of the polymer, and given the fact that smaller molecules have more sites 

available to sorb than larger molecules, it is expect that the capacity of sorption of butyl 

acetate is smaller than for the ethyl acetate. Figure 60 shows that the solubility of butyl 

acetate is about 20 times smaller than that of ethyl acetate in melted PLA, and 5 times 

smaller than that of ethyl acetate in annealed PLA. Although the dielectric constant of the 

butyl acetate is slightly lower than of ethyl acetate, the large size of butyl acetate hinders 

its access to small sorption sites, which are still available for the ethyl acetate molecules.

The melted PLA has a higher sorption coefficient for ethyl acetate value and  

annealed PLA has lower values than that obtained by Auras et al
102

. Surprisingly in 

annealed PLA the values obtained for the sorption coefficient of ethyl acetate are very 

close to those of ethyl acetate in PP, LDPE and PET, which are hydrophobic polymers.
102

 

Butyl acetate has a much lower solubility that ethyl acetate, but higher than that of 

limonene in PLA.

3.6.3. Conclusions 
 

 

Sorption isotherms of ethyl acetate and butyl acetate in PLA films, with different 

thermal treatments protocols, were measured using QCM. The sorption isotherms of ethyl 

acetate in PLA films submitted to different temperature protocols show that 

swelling/plasticizing effect of matrix of the polymer occurred caused by the flavour. The 

transition of glassy state to rubbery state due to exposure to the flavour, was disclosed 

through the A’ coefficient value obtained from the fitting of the data to the new DMS 

model. The obtained results show that the solubility of the ethyl acetate in PLA is similar 

to that of polymers commonly used in the food packaging. 

 

 

3.7. Ethane/ethylene sorption in Poly(lactic acid) films 
 

In recent years, the separation of olefin and paraffin gases has received increased 

attention. The usual method using cryogenic distillation is very expensive and thus a large 

demand for alternative energy saving processes that respect the enforced environmental 

regulations has been verified. Among a number of alternative processes, membrane 

separation technologies would be the best option if it wasn’t for their low selectivity in 

terms of olefins relatively to parent paraffins.
103

 Separation using facilitated transport 

membranes, which are composed of  a polar polymer containing oxygen atoms with 

physically dissolved ion metals such as Cu
+
 or Ag

+
, has been the subject of intensive 

research since high separation performances were obtained.
104, 105, 106

  Recently, Kim H. et 

al
107

  developed membranes based on zwitterionic compounds with an ester group that 

presented high performances for application in separation olefin-paraffin mixtures. 



96 

 

However, this technique still has some problems to be overcome, being the most important 

the poor chemical stability due to carrier poisoning.
108

 The olefin/paraffin separation 

through the use of polymeric membranes without carriers has also been studied in the 

literature. In particular, poly(imides) showed a higher permselectivity for 

propylene/propane when compared to other polymers.
109–111

 

In the present work, the solubility selectivity of PLA, a poly(ester) membrane, 

towards ethane/ethylene is investigated. Polyesters are polar polymers with oxygen atoms 

and their applicability in gas separation has not yet been studied. Nevertheless, interesting 

results of solubility of condensable gases, namely ethylene, carbon dioxide and water 

vapour in PLA films with various L:D ratios and thermal treatments were reported in 

earlier works.
 13, 73,112 

Gas sorption in polymers depends not only on the condensability of 

permeant gas but also on the polymer-penetrant gas interactions. In the present case of the 

ethane/ethylene separation, the carbon-carbon double bond in ethylene is responsible for 

the higher density of negative charge in the region of the ? bond, susceptible to electron-

seeking, and can interact favourably with the ester group of the polymer, that has 

hydrolytically labile aliphatic ester linkages in its backbone
112,113

, thus promoting an 

increase in its solubility when compared to that of ethane. Despite its high condensability, 

the weak interaction between ethane and PLA results in lower solubility relatively to 

ethylene.  

The polymer crystallization is also another parameter that has to be taken into 

account, since it determines the final properties of many technologically relevant systems 

based on semicrystalline polymers. The change of solubility, diffusivity and permeability 

coefficients with temperature and pressure can be explained in part by the 

“impermeability” of crystalline region. The effect of thermal treatment in the gas solubility 

of PLA films is well documented
73,112

 and has proved to be a valuable tool in tailoring 

polymer films to obtained specific values for sorption, diffusivity and permeability. If the 

presence of crystallites can reduce the available volume for penetrant sorption, they can 

also increase the microcavities or Langmuir sites and thus the second mode of sorption 

(Langmuir type) can play a more important role than Henry’s sites.
114

  

The improvement of permeability and permselectivity of new membranes for gas 

separation has been object of study by many authors.
103,115–118

 The first step in this type of 

work is to evaluate the solubility of the gas or gas mixture in the polymer film in order to 



97 

 

evaluate the possible interactions between them. The second step would be to address the 

transport properties that are necessary for this purpose. In this work we only explore the 

first aspect. The study of the influence of the structure of the polymer PLA film on the 

sorption and consequently on the sorption selectivity of ethane and ethylene was performed 

using the QCM technique, which has already been successfully used for that purpose.  

 

 

 

3.7.1. Sorption Results and Discussion 
 

In Table 16 the experimental sorption results obtained in this work for C2H6 in the 

three PLA films (annealed PLA 80:20, annealed PLA 98:2 and melted PLA 98:2) and for 

C2H4 in annealed PLA 80:20, between 283 K and 313 K and up to the atmospheric pressure 

are presented. The results were corrected for 100% amorphous polymer, taking into 

account that the crystalline regions do not accommodate any solute:

The sorption results of ethane and ethylene are compared in Figure 61 and Figure 

62 for 283 K and 313 K respectively.  

The lines represent the correlation with de DMSM. The sorption results have a

 at 313 K. The lines represent, in both cases, the correlation with dual-mode sorption model. 

 

The first conclusion that can be drawn from these Figures is that the solubility of 

ethylene is always larger than the solubility of ethane, for the same experimental 



100 

 

conditions. Unlike what is commonly observed the solubility of these gases does not 

follow their condensability order (T
c
 ethane = 305.3 K; T

c
 ethylene = 282.5 K).

119
 The 

higher solubility of ethylene relatively to ethane can be explained by the strong interaction 

between this gas and the polymer. PLA is a poly (?-hydroxy acid) and, as all poly (?-

esters) with hydrolytically labile aliphatic ester linkages in its backbone, can interact with 

the weak hydrogen bond basicity of alkenes, such as ethylene. On the other hand, ethane 

has no such capacity. For the studied systems, the polymer–penetrant interaction plays a 

more important role than the condensability of gas. Also as the temperature increases, the 

difference in condensability between the two gases decreases and thus the solubility of 

ethane and ethylene should become similar, which is not observed confirming that the 

polymer-penetrant interaction of ethylene is the driving force in the solubility of this gas in 

PLA. 

Analyzing the sorption results in terms of the thermal treatments of the PLA films, 

the ethylene sorption presents an opposite behavior to that observed for ethane. The 

sorption of ethylene in the annealed films (either PLA 80:20 or 98:2) is higher than in the 

melted PLA 98:2 films. When the films are submitted to temperatures higher than the Tg, 

the polymeric chain mobility is enhanced. The re-organization of linkages can promote a 

different positioning of the hydroxyl groups to the outer side of the chain and thus the 

interaction of theses linkages with the double bond of ethylene becomes more favorable. 

The lower solubility of PLA 98:2 annealed relatively at PLA 80:20 annealed films should 

be due the presence of crystalline domains that difficult the molecular orientation and 

inhibit the interaction. Note also that the annealing process was performed on films which 

already contained many micro-crystallites, while in the melted PLA 98:2 film they are 

formed from the molten polymer. This means that the crystallites present in these two films 

are naturally different from each other and thus can influence in different ways the gas 

solubility.   

 At lower temperatures the results show yet a larger difference in solubility between 

the PLA 80:20 and PLA 98:2 for both thermal treatments. This difference decreases with 

increasing temperature and at 313 K they are similar. This behavior can be explained by a 

decrease of the condensability of gases with the temperature. Ethane has a same behavior 

on overall range of temperature. The sorption is higher in PLA 98:2 annealed than in the 



101 

 

other two films. The parameters of the dual mode sorption model for the studied systems 

are summarized in Table 17.

In Figure 63 and Figure 64, the parameters related to the first (Henry) and second 

(Langmuir) sorption modes for ethane are depicted. For all the films the Henry’s solubility 

constant decreases as the temperature increases. The semi-crystalline polymers present

higher values for the Langmuir concentration, C’H.b when compared with the PLA 80:20 

(100% amorphous). This behaviour shows that there is a strong correlation between the 

crystallinity and the microcavities, meaning that the crystallites might act as virtual cross-

linkers enhancing the available free volume and thus the Langmuir sites.

The DMSM correlates very well the sorption results obtained for both ethane and 

ethylene in the three polymer films in the temperature range from 293 K to 313 K with 

overall average absolute deviation (AAD) smaller than 3% for ethane and 5% for ethylene. 

Semi-crystalline polymers have an important role at industrial level due to the fact 

that their properties can be manipulated to desired values, through the promotion of 

crystallites formation, as it can be seen in Figure 65. The change in the overall solubility 

coefficient in PLA 98:2 with temperature and thermal treatment performed is shown in 

Figure 65. As the temperature increases, the solubility coefficient decreases for all the 

studied systems. On the other hand, for the same temperature the solubility coefficient 

increases with the increase of crystallinity in the film for both gases. 

 

 

Figure 65 - Temperature dependence of the solubility coefficients of ethane and ethylene for PLA 98:2. 

 

Finally, the solubility selectivity of ethylene over ethane was calculated for the 

different PLA films is presented in Figure 66.  



104 

 

 

Figure 66 - Temperature dependence of the solubility selectivity of ethylene over ethane for the three 

different PLA films. 

Surprisingly, three different behaviours are observed: for the annealed PLA 80:20 

film the solubility selectivity decreases with temperature; for the melted PLA 98:2 film the 

solubility selectivity remains constant and for the annealed PLA 98:2 film the solubility 

selectivity increases with the temperature. These differences can be explained by the 

differences in solubility dependence with the temperature. 

From the results presented so far it is obvious that the control of polymer structure 

is very important in the production of a PLA films with an adequate selectivity for the 

studied gases The difference in the interactions between ethane and polymer film and 

ethylene and the polymer film are due to a specific interaction of the latter with the 

polymer chains but this interaction is also due to the control of the polymer structure 

through the crystallinity, which results in different mechanisms of sorption. For the PLA 

80:20, where no crystallinity was observed, the solubility selectivity can be enhanced by 

lowering the working temperature. As for the other two semi crystalline films, it is 

interesting to observe that while for the melted film (10% crystallinity) the temperature 

does not have any effect on the solubility selectivity, for the annealed film (20% 

crystallinity) this parameter can be improved by increasing the temperature. Moreover, if 

the working temperature of separation is higher than 310 K, better solubility selectivity is 

obtained if PLA 98:2 annealed films are used. Generally, among the membranes studied, 



105 

 

the PLA 80:20 presents the best performance, followed by the melted PLA 98:2 and the 

annealed PLA 98:2.  

 

3.8. Conclusions 
 

The use of PLA membranes for light olefin/paraffin separation was here studied for 

the first time. The QCM technique was successfully used to measure the solubility of C2H6 

and C2H4 in PLA with 80:20 and 98:2 (L:D) content, within the temperature range from 

283 to 313 K and pressures up to 1 bar. The differences in sorption between ethane and 

ethylene can be attributed to a specific interaction between ethylene and the polymer 

chains. A difference in sorption behaviour between membranes with different thermal 

treatments was explained by the creation of extra free volume due to the presence of 

different percentage of crystallites. The performance of these membranes decreases with 

the increase of their crystallinity.

Time-lag Technique  



108 

 

 

4.1. Introduction 
 

Gas transport through polymers is of fundamental importance as it impacts our lives 

in many different ways, from the tires on our cars and automobiles to the bags used in 

packaging food, to the membrane modules used in gas separation - the list goes on 

indefinitely.
120

  Therefore, understanding gas transport and its dependence on the 

characteristics of the polymer is undoubtedly a corner stone that enables us to control and 

improve the properties of numerous products. In the field of polymer science, three 

parameters describe the gas transport through a given material; these parameters are gas 

sorption, diffusion, and permeability.
120

  

The first observation of the permeation phenomenon goes back to 1829 when 

Graham
121

 noticed the inflation of a rubber structure in the presence of carbon dioxide.  

Permeability is the transfer of small molecules called “permeants” or “penetrants” through 

a membrane, and permeability also defines how easily the permeants transport through a 

membrane is achieved.
15

 Large permeability values are attributed to poor barrier 

membranes, and small permeability values to good barrier membranes. Plastic materials 

provide a broad range of permeabilities to small molecules such as gases, water vapour, 

organic vapours, and liquids, and thus can range from being “excellent” to “poor” 

barriers.
15

 The preservation of a food product packaged in a plastic film mainly depends on 

the maintenance of its original quality by protecting it against external deteriorative 

influences.
122

 If on the one hand the loss of water may lead to undesirable drying, 

detrimental to both the texture of the product and is economically deleterious to the 

manufacturer, on the other hand an increase in the water concentration to an increase on 

the water activity (Aw) risking to approach the region of microbial spoilage above Aw = 

0.8. More harmful than moisture is oxygen for foods from plant or animal origin due lipid 

oxidation reactions that can occur causing rancidity, especially when the package allows 

light transmittance.
122

 The other requirements for the preservation of the qualities 

(physical, chemical, sanitary, organoleptic) of the food are prevention of changes in taste, 

colour and odour.
122

 

The permeation through dense, non-porous polymers is usually described by a “sorption-

diffusion mechanism”
123

 and involves three steps: 1) sorption of the species at the 

membrane surface; 2) diffusion of the sorbed compounds through the membrane; and 3) 



109 

 

desorption of the compounds on the other side of the membrane, at the downstream face of 

the polymer. Steps 1 and 3 are very fast relative to step 2, therefore, diffusion through the 

polymer is rate-limiting step in mass transport across a membrane.
124

 In other words, the 

permeation processes take place through a membrane that separates two fluid phases (gas, 

vapour, or liquid) containing low molecular weight species with differing chemical 

potential. The molecules at the side of higher chemical potential tend to diffuse through the 

membrane and equilibrate the chemical potential on both sides. The permeation process in 

continuous polymeric materials is accomplished by molecular diffusion within the polymer 

matrix.
15,125

 Figure 67 shows a sketch of a diffusion process through a membrane.
15

 

Diffusion is a phenomenon controlled by temperature. Therefore, above the glass transition 

temperature, Tg, of a polymer, the molecules (Phase I) are first sorbed into the polymer 

and then diffuse through the polymer by an activated process of random movement 

induced by the Brownian motion of the polymer chains.
15

 Below Tg, the permeant dwelled 

in a cavity of the polymer for a while and then performs a quick jump into an adjacent 

cavity.
15

 The diffusing molecules move through the amorphous regions of a polymer 

within the free volume between the polymeric molecules.
15

 Upon diffusion through the 

membrane, the molecules are desorbed from the membrane to the low chemical potential 

side (Phase II).
15

 Various factors affect the permeability, sorption and diffusion in PLA as 

showed in Figure 68.  

 

Figure 67 – Sketch of the diffusion process through a film.
125

 

 



110 

 

The diffusion processes which occur in steady state take place at a constant rate, 

that is, once the process starts the number of molecules crossing a given interface (the flux) 

is constant with time, i.e., the flux, J, of gas in a polymer matrix can be defined as the 

quantity of diffusing, Q, which crosses the membrane with area A, and thickness l during 

the time t: 

 

At

Q
J =                                                                                                                                                            (15) 

 

 

The Fick’s First law describes the process, in which the flux through the membrane, J,  is 

proportional to the existing concentration gradient and may be expressed by the following 

equation:

where D denotes the diffusion coefficient and C the concentration of  the species inside the 

membrane, and x is the membrane spatial coordinate.
126

  The negative sign in this 

relationship indicates that the particle flow occurs in a “down” gradient direction, i.e. from 

regions of higher to regions of lower concentration. Diffusion processes for membrane-gas 

pair under steady state follow the Fick’s first law and the sorption isotherm is linear.
127

 On 

the other hand, if diffusion occurs under non-steady state, the rate of compositional change 

is proportional to the “rate of change” of the concentration gradient rather than to the 

concentration gradient itself:

Figure 68 – Examples of extrinsic and intrinsic factors affecting P, D and S in polymers such as PLA. 

(adapted from ref. 15 ). 

 

The permeability, diffusivity and solubility of PLA films towards carbon dioxide and 

oxygen have been reported, and more recently, for PLA containing antioxidants films was 

also studied.  

Several methods allow the measurement of one or more of these parameters and their 

description can be found in the literature.
121,127,128

 Two methods have been commonly used 

to measure the permeation of pure gases through dense polymer membranes: the 

differential and integral methods.
127

 Despite their advantages and disadvantages, the 

integral method, known as the time-lag method, is undoubtedly more frequently used since 

it allows for the simultaneous determination of permeability and diffusivity.
127

 In this 

method a quasi-constant pressure difference is applied to both sides of the membrane and 

the accumulation of gas on the permeate side is measured using an accurate pressure 

sensor. 
127

 As the permeate side is initially at zero pressure, the partial pressure of gas 

subsequently is the absolute pressure in this compartment, which has a fixed volume, V
P
, 

therefore, the number of moles is:

In many systems, the pressures p1 and p2 on each membrane face are known. As the p1 is 

much larger than p2 (p1&gt;&gt;p2~0), the combination of the equation (21) with equation (27) 

gives the permeability coefficient, which may be written as

In the time-lag method, when a gas pressure is applied at the feed membrane surface, 

before reaching the steady state, the flux and the concentration vary with time in every 

point inside the membrane. When t tends towards the very long times, the steady state is 

reached (Figure 69), and the time-lag, tL, can be obtained graphically from the interception 

of the abscissa coordinate place at the initial permeate pressure with the linear 

extrapolation of the permeate pressure history at pseudo steady-state.
126

 The time-lag 

parameter relates with the effective diffusion coefficient according with the following 

equation:

Applying a best-fit straight line to the observed values for the permeate pressure as a 

function of time after steady-state is established, one obtains a slope, m and an intercept, b, 

which allow to determine the permeability coefficient and the time-lag.

Figure 69 – Typical permeation and time-lag curve. 

 

 

In this work, two time-lag units were used to measure the permeability of carbon dioxide 

and oxygen in PLA membranes, being one of them assembled in the framework of this 

thesis and other was used in Laboratory for Process Engineering, Environment, 

Biotechnology and Energy (LEPAE) at Faculty of Engineering of University of Porto in 

the research group headed by Professor Adélio Mendes and that served as traceability and 

validation unit for the new unit built at the University of Aveiro. The membranes 

performance obtained in our work were firstly studied in the time-lag apparatus in LEPAE, 

and then used in our apparatus to validate our equipment, i.e, the permeability of gases in 

PLA membranes in the UA unit could reproduce the results obtained in the time-lag 

apparatus from LEPAE, which had been previously calibrated and validated. The 

permeability, diffusivity and solubility of carbon dioxide and oxygen in PLA with and 

without antioxidants were measured.

4.2. Experimental 
 

4.2.1. Time-lag apparatus 
 

A diagram of the time-lag apparatus build is shown in Figure 70. It is composed of two 

stainless steel tanks, one of them with 5 dm
3
 (feed) and the other with (34.2 ± 0.2) cm

3
 

(permeate). Both reservoirs are connected to the permeation cell, which has 13.9 cm
2
 of 

effective area. This cell is composed of a sintered disk to support the membrane and a 

viton O-ring to seal the cell. Two sensors record the pressure, one at feed tank (S-10 

WIKA, 600 KPa, ± 0.05 % FS, P1) and in the permeate tank there was a high precision 

absolute pressure sensor (MKS e-Baratron, ref. 628 C, 13.33 KPa, 0.001 % FS, P2) for 

measuring pressure variations. The time-lag unit was placed inside a thermostatic cabinet 

with a precision of ± 0.05 K. A rotatory high vacuum pump (BOC Edwards, RV3) 

guaranteed vacuum conditions. The temperature was measured with a Pt-100 placed very 

close to the time-lag cell and connected to a data acquisition switch unit (Agilent, model 

34970 with 6 ½ digit digital multimeter using Agilent BenchLink data logger software). 

The vacuum was obtained with valves V2, V3, V4 and V5 that are manipulated from the 

outside of the cabinet in order to avoid temperature changes.

4.2.2. Materials 
 

4.2.2.1.  Membranes performance 
 

In this work, many attempts to produce thin membranes using the casting method were 

made. Initially we started by spreading a PLA solution on a flat surface and then 

smoothing it with a knife and allowing it to evaporate. The membranes obtained were very 

thin and fragile and no measurements could be achieved with them since the gas instantly 

passed through them. SEM images of these membranes show that these were porous 

membranes (Figure 71). 



117 

 

 

Figure 71 – SEM image of the membrane obtained by scattering  method. 

 

This method was further improved and extra care was taken especially with the 

evaporation rate of the solvent. The membranes with and without antioxidants were 

previously described in chapter 2, and were there characterized. Before testing, the 

thickness of the films was measured using a digital micrometer (model MDC-25S, 

Mitutoya Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Mean thickness was calculated from six measurements 

taken at different locations in each sample. At least, three samples of each film type were 

measured.  

 

4.3. Results 
 

4.3.1. Gas permeation properties 
 

The barrier properties of PLA films are very important in the technological and 

functional aspects of packaging materials. In order to understand the effect of structurally 

different antioxidants incorporation on the barrier properties of PLA films, single gas 

permeation measurements using CO2 and O2 were performed at three temperatures (284 K, 

293 K and 303 K) for all the PLA films. For 313 K, only PLA membranes were studied, 

because the membranes with ?-tocopherol and BHT, exhibit an abnormal behavior at this 

temperature, perhaps because this temperature is close to Tg, and the chains can move and 

rearrange themselves in response to the stress imposed by the gas pressure. 



118 

 

 

4.3.2. Carbon dioxide permeation 
 

Typical pressure history data for CO2 permeation in PLA films in the temperature 

interval between 284 K and 303 K are shown in Figure 72. As the temperature increases, 

the time-lag becomes smaller, meaning that the diffusivity increases with temperature.  

In Table 18 are presented the results obtained by time-lag technique for PLA based 

films. Also, for neat PLA, comparison with data found in other works with PLA 

membranes containing a percentage of L-lactid near the PLA used in this work was 

performed. The results for neat PLA films towards CO2 at 303 K are in good agreement 

with that reported by Auras et al. 
129

 and Bao et al.

For all films, both permeability and diffusivity increase with temperature, while the 

opposite behaviour was found for solubility.  

The incorporation of only 2 wt.% of BHT and TBHQ into PLA films, on average, 

decreases the CO2 permeability by 44 % and 30 %, respectively, while the incorporation of 

?-tocopherol caused the opposite effect, increasing the permeability (Figure 73) This 

difference can be explained by SEM analysis where BHT and TBHQ enriched films 

revealed a more compact or integrated structure than the neat PLA (Figure 27). The 

presence of empty voids in ?-tocopherol enriched films can explain the permeation 

behaviour and thus the increase in diffusivity and permeability for this film (Figure 74). 



120 

 

The incorporation of BHT and TBHQ in the PLA films increased the carbon dioxide 

solubility, while ?-tocopherol does not produce a significant effect. (Figure 75).

Figure 75 – Carbon dioxide solubility of antioxidants PLA films. 

 

Many attempts were made to study the permeability of CO2 in films containing 2 wt% 

of ?-tocopherol, but the absence of time-lag for this concentration led us again to cast 

some doubts on the methodology used to make the membranes. Many different membranes 

were studied without observing a time-lag. However, the results could be obtained at 

higher concentrations of ?-tocopherol and SEM images of the films are compared in 

Figure 76. The SEM image of the film enriched with 4 wt% of ?-tocopherol, revealed that 

the size of the voids is smaller than in the film at 2 wt%, and that the film gained some 

homogeneity despite having areas similar to an orange peel appearance. The increase of the 

amount of ?-tocopherol seemed to improve the morphological properties, that continued to 

be, nevertheless, still quite poor.

 The activation energies for CO2 permeability for PLA/BHT-2 wt.%, 

PLA/TBHQ-2 wt% and PLA-4 wt.% ?-tocopherol films were roughly the same as those 

obtained for neat PLA. The activation energy for CO2 diffusivity increases 8 % for 

PLA/BHT-2 wt.%, and about 24 % for both PLA/TBHQ-2 wt% and PLA-4 wt.% ?-

tocopherol films, relatively to neat PLA. The obtained activation energy for CO2 solubility 

decrease about 16 % for PLA/BHT-2 wt.%, and decrease about 47 % for PLA/TBHQ-2

4.3.3. Oxygen permeation 
 

 

In Table 20 the results obtained by time-lag technique for PLA based films are 

presented. Also, for neat PLA, are shown some data found in other works with PLA 

membranes containing a percentage of L-lactide near the PLA used in this work. The 

results for neat PLA film towards O2 at 303 K are in good agreement with those reported 

by Auras et al. 
129

 and Bao et al.
130

  

As expected, for the same membrane, at the same temperature, the time-lag is greater 

for carbon dioxide than for the oxygen. Surprisingly, the films with 2 wt% ?-tocopherol 

did not show a significant time-lag for the carbon dioxide but showed a small time-lag for 

oxygen. An explanation for this change of behavior may be due the fact that ?-tocopherol 

act as oxygen scavenger, and thus takes longer time to reach the equilibrium. This will be a 

hypothesis to investigate in the future.

130

 (PLA98,7 % L-lactide, 4% crystallinity, casting). 

 

As observed for CO2 permeation, the permeability and diffusivity of O2 in the PLA 

films with and without antioxidants increased with temperature, while the solubility 

decreased, as expect. The O2 permeation and solubility in PLA at 303 K are 1.7 times and 

4 times higher those reported by Bao et al. 
130

, respectively and the diffusivity is about 2.5 

times lower. These discrepancies may be due to differences in the crystallinity, because our 

films have about 45 % crystallinity and Bao et al 
130

 reported 4 % of crystallinity in their 



127 

 

films. The increased crystallinity of our films might have caused highly tortuous paths 

within the membrane and consequently a decrease of the diffusivity.  

The incorporation of only 2 wt.% of BHT and TBHQ into PLA films, on average, 

decreases the O2 permeability by 40 % and 19 %, respectively, while the incorporation of 4 

wt.% of ?-tocopherol into PLA films did not significantly affect the permeability towards 

O2 from 283 K to 293 K, but increase for 303 K (Figure 80).

Figure 80 – Oxygen permeation of antioxidants  PLA films. 

 

The decrease in the O2 permeability obtained for the PLA films with incorporated 

BHT and TBHQ can be attributed to their slow gas diffusion compared to the pure PLA 

film. A similarity in behaviour pattern between permeability and diffusivity is observed, 

and this result is consistent with the well known gas transport behaviour in dense polymer 

membranes. Although gas molecules dissolve into the polymer and diffuse through it, the 

differences in the gas permeability mainly arise from the diffusion differences of each gas 

component (Figure 81) in the polymer film since the solubilities tend to slightly increase or 

to be similar (Figure 82). Furthermore, SEM images revealed that films with 2 wt% of 

these antioxidants (Figure 27) present a better integrity than PLA. If their structure is more 

cohesive, and the diffusion of both carbon dioxide and oxygen is lower than in neat PLA, 

then these two antioxidants may be acting as fillers.

It is visible a lack of linearity of the permeability with the temperature for the PLA 

membranes enriched with ?-tocopherol and also for the solubility of both PLA enriched 

films with ?-tocopherol and BHT. The same behaviour was also found by QCM technique, 

for the same antioxidants.

The activation energies for O2 permeability, diffusivity and solubility in the neat 

PLA films have the same order of magnitude of those determined by Bao et al. The 

incorporation of antioxidants into PLA films does not affect the activation energy for O2 

permeability, but a less endothermic diffusivity than that observed for the neat PLA was 

found for BHT and TBHQ. Also, the incorporation of 2 wt % of BHT or TBHQ into PLA 

films renders the oxygen solubility in PLA films a less exothermic process.  

As found by QCM technique, at higher temperatures, the oxygen solubility in ?-

tocopherol enriched films increase. This behaviour is independent of the thermal treatment 

of the films, because in QCM the films were melted. Once more, the mobility of the 

polymeric chains must occur, and the increase of free volume promotes de solubility. 

 

4.4. Conclusions 
 

Carbon dioxide and oxygen are two of the main permeants studied in packaging 

application, because they may transfer from internal or external environment through the 

polymer package wall, influencing the quality and shelf-life of the food. The introduction 

of new packaging material PLA based as well its end-use application depend of its barrier 



133 

 

properties. The incorporation of only 2 wt % of BHT and TBHQ decreases the carbon 

dioxide permeability in average 44 % and 30 % and decrease the oxygen permeability by 

40 % and 20 %, respectively. Although the barrier properties have been improved, the 

BHT or TBHQ-PLA based membranes have lower CO2 and O2 permeability coefficients 

than PS and PP but higher than PET, the most used to make plastic bottles for carbonated 

drinks due to good barrier to oxygen and carbon dioxide. Regarding to barrier properties of 

the PLA (Figure 89 and Figure 90), it could replaces a wide variety of synthetic polymers 

used in packaging industry, if not were its brittleness failure and low tensile elongation.

These results demonstrate the potential applicability of both antioxidants to produce 

antioxidants-PLA based films with applicability in food packaging. Nevertheless, the 

methodology to produce PLA/?-tocopherol based membranes needs to be improved in 

order to increase its homogeneity and compatibility between the antioxidant and the PLA 

matrix.

5. General Conclusions and Final 

Remarks  
 



136 

 

This work shows that it is possible to improve PLA’s properties by the addition of 

chosen amounts of specific antioxidants. Here, PLA based membranes were additivated 

with synthetic (BHT and TBHQ) and natural (?-tocopherol) based antioxidants and further 

characterized for their final structural, morphological and barrier properties. This work 

demonstrates that PLA’s properties can be enhanced by incorporation of antioxidants such 

as BHT and TBHQ. The addition of 10 wt% of each of these antioxidants to PLA films 

promotes the decrease of their Tg, which is important to improve the flexural properties of 

PLA. Based on this study, complementary studies, such as elastic modulus measurements, 

are needed in order to better understand this behaviour and deeply evaluate the impact of 

those antioxidants on the flexibility of TBHQ/PLA based films.  

 Regarding the introduction of ?-tocopherol in PLA based membranes, new 

strategies are needed to enhance the compatibility between this antioxidant and the PLA 

matrix. Also, the yellowish colour of the PLA/?-tocopherol films needs to be investigated.  

 A time-lag apparatus was build during this thesis so that carbon dioxide and oxygen 

barrier properties of the several prepared films could be studied. Good agreement with 

literature data was obtained for pure PLA’s films permeability towards carbon dioxide and 

oxygen. The incorporation of only 2 wt% of BHT and TBHQ in the PLA matrix can 

decrease the carbon dioxide permeability by 44 % and 30 % and the oxygen permeability 

by 40 % and 20 %, respectively. Films containing 4 wt% of ?-tocopherol present carbon 

dioxide and oxygen permeability which are very similar to those of pure PLA.  

 It would be interesting to study PLA with higher molecular weight, since the Tg of 

PLA increases with molecular weight, the additivation of PLA with 2 wt% of antioxidants 

may not represent a problem, regarding the transition to the rubbery state.  

 Considering the good results obtained after incorporation of TBHQ into PLA, films 

enriched with TBHQ amounts approved by FDA should be investigated. However, it 

should be noted that this compound is prohibited in Canada and in the European Union 

which highlights the need for the use of natural based antioxidant alternatives. Since the 

compatibility between the ?-tocopherol and the PLA matrix seems unlikely, based on the 

results obtained in this work, it should be interesting to find other potential candidates, 

such as rosemary extracts, which already revealed powerful antioxidant properties being 

able to simultaneously work as plasticizers.

A.1.1 – Measurement of the volumes of the tanks 
 

The size of the permeate tank was measured using the gas expansion method, which entails 

expanding fixed amount of gas to or from the permeate tank, while monitoring the pressure 

change. By repeating the same gas expansion procedure with and without a calibration 

volume in either thanks involved, and using the ideal gas law, one can easily obtain the 

volume of the permeate tank.  

 

For determining the volume of the tanks, were carried out the following steps: 

 

a) Perform vacuum in both tanks, initially empty; 

b) Close de valve between the tanks A and B (see Figure 91); 

c) Introduce nitrogen in tank A until a given pressure, PA, is reached; 

d) Open de valve between tank A and tank B, and record the equilibrium pressure; 

e) Performing the above steps at least 10 times.

A.1.2 – Calibration of the temperature sensor 
 

 

The sensor used for monitoring the temperature had a output signal in ohm. For the 

conversion to Celsius degrees, was used a thermocouple calibrated in accredited  

laboratory. The relationship between the output signal of the sensor used to monitoring the 

temperature of the permeability system and the thermocouple calibrated traceable to 

international standards is shown in
