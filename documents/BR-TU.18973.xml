Introduction/Objectives: Controlled-release lithium formulations were developed to minimize elevated blood
peaks, related to side-effects and intoxications. However, there is little information about the bioavailability of the
only controlled-release lithium formulation available in Brazil. The objective of this study was to compare the
bioavailability of controlled-release and immediate-release lithium formulations, after single and multiple doses.
Methods: Twelve healthy volunteers received 900 mg of immediate-release or controlled-release lithium carbonate in
single or multiple doses during 9 days. After single dose administration, the following parameters were analyzed for
each formulation: maximum lithium concentration (C

max
); time to reach C

max
 (t

max
); area under the curve of serum

concentration versus time (AUC
0-12

 and AUC
0-?) and the elimination half-life (t1/2 elim.). After multiple doses, Cmax;

t
max

; AUC
0-12

; mean (C
mean

) and minimum drug concentration (C
min

) and degree of fluctuation (DF) were analyzed. A
90% confidence interval (90%CI) for the ratio between the AUCs for each formulation was constructed.
Results/Discussion: Following single dose, the two formulations were bioequivalent; however, they were not
after multiple doses. This fact could be a consequence of methodological limitations of lithium level’s measurements
since, following single dose, these levels could not be detected at time periods 24 and 48h in many volunteers,
compromising the calculation of t

1/2 elim
 ,and consequently of the AUC

0-? and the 90%CI to the ratio of these areas.
Therefore, the bioequivalence found after single dose may be an unreliable result.

Introdução/Objetivo: Formulações de liberação controlada de lítio foram produzidas para minimizar picos
sangüíneos elevados relacionados a efeitos colaterais e intoxicações. No entanto, o único produto com liberação
controlada de lítio disponível no Brasil possui poucas informações a respeito de sua biodisponibilidade. O
presente estudo tem como objetivo comparar a biodisponibilidade de formulações de liberação imediata e
controlada de carbonato de lítio, após administração de doses única e múltiplas.
Métodos: Voluntários sadios (n=12) receberam 900 mg de carbonato de lítio de liberação imediata ou controlada,
em dose única ou durante nove dias. Após dose única, foram analisados, para cada formulação, concentração
sangüínea máxima de lítio (C

ASC de cada formulação.
Resultados/Discussão: Após dose única, as duas formulações mostraram-se bioequivalentes; no entanto,
não o foram após doses múltiplas. Esse fato talvez decorra das limitações do método de determinação da litemia,
uma vez que, após dose única, as concentrações nos períodos de tempo 24 e 48 horas não foram detectáveis para
muitos voluntários, prejudicando o cálculo do t

1/2 elim. 
e, conseqüentemente, o da ASC

0-? e do IC90% para a razão
dessas áreas. Logo, a bioequivalência encontrada após dose única pode não ser um resultado confiável.

Introduction
The prophylactic-therapeutic action of lithium salts in bipo-

lar disorder has been confirmed by many studies in several
countries.1,3 The carbonate salt has been chosen for pills and
capsules, as it is less hygroscopic and less irritating to the
gastric mucosa than others, especially chloride.4 It is commer-
cially available in immediate-release formulations. However, this
kind of formulation produces high lithium blood levels, which
have been associated to side effects and intoxication originated
from the product.5

Alternatively, the modified or controlled-release formula-
tions provide specific advantages over immediate-release for-
mulations, due to decreased blood peaks secondary to a
showed absorption rate. The elimination phase of the drug’s
decreasing curve is altered, causing an increase in the elimi-
nation half-life, allowing to the administration of a daily single
dose instead of the traditional divided doses – two or three
(b.i.d. or t.i.d.)–, diminishing the chance of patients forget-
ting the drug, and increasing their compliance. Besides, the
chance of survival after an overdose rises as there is more
time for a gastric lavage before the plasmatic concentration
reaches its peak value.6-8

There have been several studies comparing the bioavailability
of the controlled-release formulations existent in the world mar-
ket.9-11 Nevertheless, there is scarce information about the
bioavailability of the only product with controlled-release lithium
available in Brazil.12

The objective of this study is to compare the bioavailability
of controlled and immediate-release formulations of lithium car-
bonate (Carbolithium CR 450 mg and Carbolithium 300 mg;
Eurofarma Laboratórios Ltda, SP, Brazil) after administration of
single and multiple (nine days) doses to healthy volunteers.

Materials and Methods
Twelve healthy, Caucasian, male volunteers (aging 18 to 30),

selected through an advertisement in the premises of the Fed-
eral University of São Paulo (Unifesp) participated in the study.
The Institution’s Research Ethics Committee previously ap-
proved the study. The volunteers gave written informed con-
sent before beginning the study. They all went through physi-
cal and psychiatric assessment, with the Structured Clinical
Interview for the DSM-IV axis I disorders – non- patient edi-
tion13 and routine laboratory tests (hemogram, creatinine, uric
acid, glutamic oxalacetic transaminase [GOT], glutamic piruvic
transaminase [GPT], thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], free
tetraiodothyronine [T

4-
], cholesterol, triglycerids, urea, glucose

and magnesium, sodium, potassium and chlorine). The pres-
ence of any result with a clinically significant deviation from
the normality was an exclusion criterion.

The volunteers were instructed to abstain from consuming
alcohol, drugs and any other kind of medications during the
study’s period.

We used immediate-release lithium carbonate (Carbolithium
300 mg – lot 016.98), and controlled-release (Carbolithium CR
450 mg – lot 004.98) formulations, donated by Eurofarma
Laboratórios Ltda (SP, Brazil).

The study consisted in a two-phase cross-over study (I:
single dose and II: multiple doses) in which the 12 volunteers
were randomically divided in two groups (A and B). They
were instructed to fast for 10 hours before the beginning of
the procedure and 4 hours after drug administration. In phase
I, the volunteers received 900 mg of lithium carbonate as a
single dose at 8:00h A.M. (group A: immediate release formu-
lation and group B controlled-release formulation). Blood
samples 5 ml were collected immediately before the ingestion
of the drug (time 0) and after the time intervals 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3,
4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours. A week after, the procedure was
repeated, and treatments were alternated.

In phase II, both groups of volunteers (A and B) received 900
mg/day of lithium carbonate during nine days. Group A re-
ceived 2 immediate-release pills at 8:00 A.M. and 1 pill at 08:00
P.M., and group B received 1 controlled-release pill at 8:00 A.M
and other at 08:00 P.M. Blood samples were collected on the
eighth day of treatment, immediately before the morning inges-
tion of the drug (time zero) and afterwards in the same time
intervals (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48). The blood lithium
was determined in triplicate with the ion-selective electrode tech-
nique (EasyLyte Na/K/Cl/Li Analyzer – Medica Corporation,
Massachusetts, USA).

Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined according to
the rules of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),14 of the
United States Pharmacopeia15 and of the National Sanitary Vigi-
lance Agency from Brazil.16

• Phase I – single dose: AUC: area under the curve (in
mEq.h/l) delineated by the drug’s concentration versus
time, calculated by the trapezoidal method from time zero
to time 12 h (AUC

0-t
) and extrapolated to infinitum (AUC

0-

?); t1/2: elimination half-life time, corresponds to the time
needed for a drug to reach half of the initial blood
concentration; C

max
: corresponds to the maximum lithium

concentration, in mEq./l, directly obtained from individu-
al curves of concentration vs. time; T

max
: refers to the

time, in hours, in which C
max

 was achieved. This value
was directly obtained from individual curves of blood
concentration vs. time.

• Phase II – multiple doses: AUC
0-12

; C
max

; T

; C

: drug
concentration at the end of each interval between doses,
in the steady state, directly obtained from the graph of
blood concentration vs. time for each subject, in mEq/l;
C

mean
: mean drug concentration (mEq/l) in the steady state,

obtained by the equation: C
mean

 = (AUC
0-t

)/?, where ?
corresponds to the interval between doses (in this case,
12 hours); %F: the degree of fluctuation of drug
concentrations, calculated by the equation: %F = [(C

máx 
–

C
min

)/ C
mean 

] x 100%.
The AUC parameter was used to obtain the 90% confidence

interval (90%CI) for the differences of means between con-
trolled-release and immediate-release products, transformed into
the Neperian logarithm (ln). As this is a study with a controlled-
release product, this conclusion does not take into account the
confidence interval obtained for C

max
, as this is intentionally

modified in this kind of formulation. Two drug formulations are

considered bioequivalent when the antilogs of the 90%CIs for
the ratios of AUC means fall between 0.8 and 1.25.

The parameters AUC

 and C

 were submitted to analysis
of variance (ANOVA) to assess if there were effects
formulation’s order of administration of the i.e., of phase (I and
II) and of treatment (immediate and controlled-release).

The other pharmacokinetic parameters of immediate and con-
trolled-release formulations were compared with paired t test,
except for the T

max
, for which it has been recommended a non-

parametric analysis (Wilcoxon’s test).17

The assessment of adverse effects of the two lithium carbon-
ate formulations was performed by a Side Effects Scale, devel-
oped by the researchers and composed of the 21 main adverse
effects cited in the literature for this drug. For each of them, the
volunteer should choose the option that better described its
intensity at the moment, which varied from the degree zero (ab-
sence of effect) to 3 (great effect). This scale was administered
in phase I (before the drug administration and 3, 6 and 12 hours
after it) and in phase II (before the beginning of the treatment
and after eight days).

Results
The sample was composed by 12 healthy, young (age

23.7±3.4), male volunteers with a mean body mass of 74.7±9.6
Kg, mostly students or employees in the University.

During phase I (single dose administration), lithium blood
levels in several collecting time-points were under the assay’s
sensitivity level (0.2 mEq/l). Therefore, only in 7 out of 12
collections the concentrations were detectable in all volun-
teers: time 0 (before the ingestion of lithium, considered as
blood lithium zero) and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours after the drug
administration.

A three-way ANOVA revealed absence of order effects(firstly
immediate or controlled release) or treatment (controlled or im-
mediate-release formulations) in the measurements of AUC
(F=0.11 and 1.48, respectively, p&gt;0.05) and C

max
 (F=0.66 and

4.50, respectively; p&gt;0.05), but a significant phase effect (single
or multiple doses) in AUC

0-t
 and C

max
 (F=91.5 and 36.51; respec-

tively, p&lt;0.001). The ANOVA also revealed a significant inter-
action between phase and treatment for AUC (F=147.6; p&lt;0.001)
and C

max
 (F=48.96; p&lt;0.001).

Data analysis from phase I (single dose) showed that the
controlled-release formulation produced smaller AUC

0-12
 and

C
max

 when compared to the immediate-release formulation
(Table 1). However, there was no difference between the for-
mulations’ AUC

0-?, since the 90%CI for the mean differences
between formulations was into the values pre-established by
the FDA (0.8 to 1.25). The statistical analysis of the remaining
parameters showed that the controlled-release formulation
produced a significantly higher T

max
 than the immediate-re-

lease formulation (z=2.803, p&lt;0.01), but the t
1/2elim. 

was not dif-
ferent for both formulations (t=-1.37; p&gt;0.05).

The values (mean ± standard deviation) of the curve of
lithium concentration versus time in healthy volunteers after
a 900-mg single dose of immediate and controlled-release
lithium carbonate are in Figure 1. The individual curves pro-

duced by both formulations are in Figure 2. It is noteworthy
that volunteers 4, 6, 8, 11 and 12 showed very similar or even
equal T

max
 values for both formulations. Regarding the C

max

produced by both products, they were similar in volunteers
4 and 11.

The data analysis of Phase II (multiple-dose administration)
revealed that both formulations were similar as regards the C

max

(Table 2). However, the time to reach the maximum concentration,
or T

max
, was longer after the administration of the controlled-

release formulation. Formulations also differed as concerns the
AUC

0-12, since the confidence interval for mean differences be-
tween formulations was not within the limits pre-established by
the FDA (0.8 to 1.25). For the remaining parameters, the con-
trolled-release formulation produced a higher mean minimum
blood concentrations of the drug than the immediate-release for-
mulation, with a lower percentage of concentration fluctuation
(%F) along the day. The values (mean ± standard deviation) of
the curve of blood lithium concentration versus time in healthy
volunteers (n=12) after multiple doses of immediate-release
(Carbolithium 300 mg) and controlled-release (Carbolithium CR
450 mg) lithium carbonate for 9 days are in Figure 3, whereas the
individual curves of these formulations are in Figure 4. It is note-
worthy that volunteers 6, 10, 11 and 12 showed similar T

max
 val-

ues for both formulations. As for lithium blood concentrations in
volunteer 12, they did not vary over time after the administration
of controlled-release formulation.

Analysis of the Side-Effects Scale
The reports recorded in the Side-Effects Scale show that

eight volunteers had softened stools after a single dose of
controlled-release formulation and only two of them after the
administration of the immediate-release formulation. The re-
port of softened stools was also the most important effect
during the administration of multiple doses, having been re-
ported by five volunteers who received the controlled-release
formulation and by two volunteers who received the immedi-
ate-release formulation. Some volunteers also described sleep
alterations (n=6), irritability (n=2) or abdominal pain (n=4),
which occurred more frequently with both formulations in the
beginning of the treatment (3 or 4 days).

Discussion
The results of the study allow us to state that after a single

dose both formulations were bioequivalent regarding the drug
amount in the body in the time interval zero extrapolated to

Table 2 - Pharmacokinetic parameters (mean ± standard deviation) and
confidence intervals obtained after administration of multiple doses (9
days) of 900  mg/day of immediate and controlled-release lithium carbonate

infinitum. After a single dose the C
max

 of the controlled-re-
lease formulation was significantly lower than that of the im-
mediate-release. T

max
 of controlled-release formulation was sig-

nificantly longer than that of immediate release. These results
are in accordance with the profile of a controlled-release drug,
i.e., the production of lower blood concentrations in a longer
time interval after the drug administration.

The elimination half-life time after the single dose treat-
ment with controlled-release lithium carbonate (Carbolithium
CR 450 mg) and the immediate-release (Carbolithium 300 mg)
formulations did not differ (t

1/2elim
: controlled-release

=39±6.71; immediate-release =34.25±10.75). However, it was
expected that the controlled-release formulation would have
a higher t

1/2elim
, allowing to a decreased frequency of the

treatment administration.6 A possible explanation for this
result is that during this study phase (single dose), due to
the fact that some volunteers’ lithium blood after 24 hours
were under the assay’s lower detection limit (0.2 mEq/L),
their values have not been measured and, therefore, have
been considered as absence of lithium. Thus, the determina-
tion of the elimination rate constant (?

z
), which is calculated

based on the individual curve of the plasma concentration
vs. time was compromised as well as the determination of the
T

1/2elim 
(T

1/2elim 
=(ln2)/?

z
).

After multiple doses of immediate and controlled-release
lithium carbonate formulations there were no bioequivalence,
as the 90%CI for the AUCs

0-12
 was 1.15 - 1.28. The controlled-

release formulation produced minimum (C
min

) and mean (C
mean

)
serum lithium concentrations significantly higher than those of
the immediate-release formulation, and a lower fluctuation of
concentrations (%F). Knowing that the fluctuation is a mea-
sure of the effectiveness of sustained released formulation,5,10

which has been usually related to a lower incidence of side-
effects, the results indicate that the controlled-release formula-
tion could be a safe alternative for the patients’ treatment. How-
ever, both formulations were similar regarding the maximum
concentration produced, the opposite to what was expected for

this kind of product. This may be due to the fact that multiple
doses of the controlled-release formulation had produced a high
incidence of diarrhea, thus leading to sodium loosening in the
feces and a consequent lithium retention, as these ions tend to
maintain an equilibrium. This might have raised the blood lev-
els of this drug, producing a higher C

max
. However, there was no

alteration in the T
max

, and the controlled-release formulation
continued to produce C

max
 after a longer administration time

than the immediate-release formulation.
Although lithium has a linear pharmacokinetics with the doses

clinically used, the results of the current study showed differ-
ences in the bioequivalence after single and multiple doses of
both formulations. Possibly the bioequivalence observed after
the single dose stems from the problem occurred with levels of
detection of lithium after 24 hours in some volunteers. This may
have compromised the correct determination of the T

1/2elim
 (as

already mentioned) and consequently the estimates of AUC
0-?,

as AUC
0-?= AUCt + Ct/?z.

The parameter usually accepted to measure the absorbed
drug amount is the AUC, which is proportional to the drug’s
absorbed fraction, provided its elimination process be linear.
However, many times this process is not linear or can be modi-
fied by the excipient, making the elimination not constant.
Therefore, equal AUCs are not a sufficient proof that the ab-
sorbed fractions are equal, even in a linear elimination pro-
cess.18 Due to that, other parameters have been proposed for
these studies.19-21

Other questionable aspect is whether the pharmacological
bioequivalence is a measure of the therapeutic equivalence
of both products, i.e., the absence of pharmacological
bioequivalence necessarily would indicate a lack of thera-
peutic equivalence?22
