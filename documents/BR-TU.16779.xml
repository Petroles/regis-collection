Abstract  

The destruction caused by an earthquake at a site depends on many factors like source 

characteristics such as magnitude, epicentral distance from the site, depth of the source, and on 

the geological setting of the area. The destruction caused due to the geological setting of an area 

is termed as site effect. To model the site effect of an area is to determine the shaking level 

longevity and its displacement amplification. The elastic properties (shear and compressional 

wave velocities, density, thickness of soil layer, etc.) of the site are required to find out by 

employing various geophysical procedures. The knowledge of these elastic properties help in 

better designing the infrastructure, which reduces the chances of destruction caused by a local 

geological setting due to an earthquake occurrence. This procedure is widely termed as 

microzonation. The most important parameters for the microzonation are the thickness of soft 

sediments over the seismic bedrock and its shear wave velocity profile. These two parameters are 

properly characterized by employing various geophysical techniques like borehole measurement, 

seismic reflection and seismic refraction. The conventional geophysical methods bring some 

hindrance to the picture such as, the drilling of a borehole and artificial seismic sources 

deployment for the reflection and refraction survey, which are both expensive and time 

consuming, difficult or even in some case impossible to implement in urbanized environment, 

the investigation is depth limited to few tens of meter. The methods which replaced this 

conventional geophysical method from the last decades or so is the analysis of Earth vibration 

caused by the seismic noise which is produced by both natural and cultural sources. This ambient 

seismic noise can be recorded with less cost and effort with good lateral coverage. Various 

seismic noise techniques are employed for this job; however, the one which got the most 

attention in recent years is the horizontal over vertical spectral ratio (H/V) technique. The H/V 

spectral ratio curve is a fast easy and cheap tool for the near-subsurface characterization. There 

are various study performed on the topic which has tried to cover almost all the aspects and 

problems associated with the method. Here in this study, we try to detail the aspects of this 

technique, which are not been evaluated fully. The different modelling procedures presented to 

model and physically link the H/V curve with some physical phenomenon will be discussed and 

its numerical result with the experimental H/V curve will be compared for a borehole test site.  

The peak and the shape of the H/V curve will be modelled to find its peak frequency deviation 

from the shear wave resonance frequency by considering different wave-field around the peak. 

Similarly, the shape dominancy of the H/V curve linkage will be find out. The peak frequency of 

the H/V curve is used to estimate the thickness-frequency relation by regression analysis. Here 

we will show that the dispersion curve obtained from multi-channel analysis of surface waves 

(MASW) can be used to estimate the velocity at one meter and the shear wave velocity increase 

trend with depth. These values can be used to estimate the thickness frequency relation for an 

area and its result will be compared with the experimentally derived thickness-frequency 

relationship for the same area. The sensitivity of the H/V curve shape to the subsurface velocity 

structure will find out for two main modelling techniques (Rayleigh wave ellipticity and diffused 

field based H/V curve). The different parts of the H/V curve are inverted (back modelled) to find

out the part of H/V curve which is carrying the most important information about the subsurface 

structure. The lesson learned from all this analysis will be applied to experimental data of three 

different sites. The Love waves might contaminate the result of the H/V curve. Two different 

techniques to remove their effects will be discussed.  Then, the joint inversion result of the 

dispersion and this Love effect removed H/V for more precisely ellipticity curve is discussed. 

Some new aspects of the H/V curve technique are also discussed at the end.

Caracterização da subsuperfície rasa através da curva da razão espectral 

H/V e da inversão conjunta das curvas de dispersão e de elipticidade 

 

Resumo 
 

A destruição causada por um terremoto depende de muitos fatores, como características e 

profundidade da fonte, magnitude, distância epicentral e da configuração geológica da área. A 

destruição causada devido à configuração geológica da área é denominada como efeito local. A 

modelagem do efeito local implica na determinação do tempo e nível de vibração e do efeito de 

amplificação do deslocamento. As propriedades elásticas dos materiais geológicos (velocidade 

das ondas de compressão e de cisalhamento, densidade, espessura da camada de solo, etc.) 

podem ser obtidas por diversos métodos geofísicos. O conhecimento dessas propriedades 

elásticas ajuda a melhor projetar as infraestruturas e reduzir as chances de danos. Este 

procedimento é denominado de microzoneamento. Os parâmetros mais importantes para realizar 

o microzoneamento são as espessuras dos sedimentos que recobrem o embasamento e o perfil 

das velocidades das ondas S (cisalhamento). Esses dois parâmetros são adequadamente 

caracterizados pelo uso de várias técnicas geofísicas como perfilagens em furos de sondagem, 

reflexão e refração sísmica. Esses métodos geofísicos trazem algumas restrições como a 

necessidade da execução de um furo, emprego de fontes sísmicas artificiais que muitas vezes são 

dispendiosas e por vezes de uso restrito em áreas urbanas, além de muitas vezes estarem 

limitadas a investigações de apenas algumas dezenas de metros. Os métodos que substituíram 

esses métodos geofísicos convencionais nas últimas décadas são a análise do ruído sísmico 

produzido por fontes naturais e culturais. Este ruído sísmico ambiental pode ser registrado com 

menor custo e esforço e com boa cobertura lateral. Várias técnicas que se utilizam do ruído 

sísmico podem ser empregadas, no entanto, aquela que obteve maior atenção nos últimos anos é 

a técnica da razão do espectro horizontal sobre o espectro vertical da onda de superfície (H/V). A 

curva da razão espectral H/V é uma ferramenta rápida, fácil e de baixo custo para a 

caracterização da subsuperfície rasa. Existem vários estudos realizados sobre o tema que 

tentaram cobrir todos os aspectos e problemas associados ao método. Aqui neste estudo são 

aprofundados alguns aspectos ainda não avaliados em detalhe. Diferentes procedimentos para a 

modelagem e as associações entre os fenômenos físicos envolvidos e as características da curva 

H/V são discutidos e os resultados numéricos desses estudos são comparados com informações 

extraídas de perfis de sondagens de um dos locais estudados. O pico e a forma da curva H / V 

são modelados para encontrar o desvio na frequência de pico a partir da frequência de 

ressonância da onda de cisalhamento considerando diferentes campos de onda em torno do pico, 

assim como sua relação com a forma dominante da curva. A frequência de pico das curvas H/V é 

utilizada para estimar a relação entre a frequência a espessura através de análise de regressão. O 

estudo mostra que a curva de dispersão obtida a partir de um ensaio MASW pode ser usada para 

estimar a velocidade da onda S a um metro de profundidade e sua tendência de aumento com a 

profundidade. Esses valores podem ser usados para estimar a relação frequência-espessura para 

uma área. Esses resultados são comparados com a relação frequência-espessura derivada 

experimentalmente para a mesma área. A sensibilidade da forma da curva H/V à estrutura de 

velocidade do meio é analisada através de duas técnicas de modelagem (elipticidade da onda 

Rayleigh e campo difuso baseado na curva H/V). Diferentes partes da curva H/V são invertidas 

visando avaliar qual a parte da curva H/V contém as informações mais importantes sobre a 

estrutura subterrânea. As lições aprendidas dessas análises são aplicadas a três dados

experimentais de locais distintos. As ondas Love podem contaminar o resultado da curva H/V. 

Duas técnicas diferentes para remover o efeito das ondas amorosas são discutidas. Em seguida, 

são discutidos os resultados da inversão conjunta das curvas de dispersão e da curva H/V após 

remoção do efeito da onda Love, ou seja, a curva de elipticidade. Alguns aspectos novos da 

técnica H/V são discutidos no final.

Chapter 1: Introduction to the study 
 

1. Introduction  

 

The level of damage and destruction caused by an earthquake in developed area, like Mexico 

City, Loma Prieta, Kobe and Izmit, followed a complicated pattern. This localized destruction is 

attributed to longer shaking and higher amplification of seismic motion caused by the geological 

and geotechnical setting of the area. It is also termed as local site effect. To model the site effect 

of an area is to determine the shake level longevity and its displacement amplification. For this, 

is required to find the elastic properties (shear and compressional wave velocities, densities, the 

thickness of soil layer, etc.) of the site which are inferred by employing various geophysical 

procedures. This reduces the chances of destruction by an earthquake, that was caused by a local 

geological setting. This procedure is widely termed as microzonation. 

The two very important parameters of the microzonation studies are the thickness of the 

sediment cover and, most importantly, the shear wave velocity profile of the site. Both these 

parameters hold the capacity to estimate the amplification caused by soft soil cover in case of 

motion triggered at its base due to the earthquake. To map out these important parameters, some 

conventional geophysical techniques are employed such as downhole measurement, seismic 

reflection and refraction. The conventional geophysical methods bring some hindrances to the 

picture such as drilling borehole and artificial seismic sources required for the reflection and 

refraction survey, which are both expensive, time consuming and difficult or even, in some 

cases, impossible to implement in urbanized environment. The investigation depth is limited to 

few tens of meter. The method that replaced these conventional geophysical methods from last 

decades or so is the analysis of earth vibration caused by the seismic noise which is produced by 

both natural and cultural sources. This ambient seismic noise can be recorded with less cost and 

effort with a good lateral coverage. Due to its large usage and importance for geological 

investigation and seismic hazard prevention, it was necessary to define the standard operation 

protocol for the seismic noise data acquisition, processing and interpretation. A project initiated 

to design experimental, processing and interpretative protocol  with the collaboration of the 14 

European research institutes in the years of 2001-2004 (SESAME European Project) provided 

the guidelines for the researchers involved with this theme, reported and are used extensively 

afterward. 

 

1.1 The objective of the study 

 

The survey of seismic noise methods specially performed to estimate  shear wave velocity profile 

and thickness are done with a single 3 component seismometer, an array of 3c or one component 

vertical sensors. The single station measurement is used to obtain a horizontal over vertical 

Fourier spectral ratio while the array method is used to retrieve the dispersion curve which is 

combined with H/V curve and jointly inverted for the shear wave velocity profile estimation of 



 
 

2 
 

deep soil packages. Many studies performed on this topic have shown the results in a good 

agreement with borehole techniques. The basic assumption of those methods are that surface 

wave are dominating the seismic noise wavefield and the shape of the H/V curve are mostly 

dominated by fundamental mode of Rayleigh wave ellipticity. The seismic noise wavefield also 

contains the fraction of Love and body waves which contaminate the H/V curve and deviates its 

shape from Rayleigh wave ellipticity. 

The two most important features of the H/V curve are the peak frequency and the shape of the 

curve. The peak frequency is used for the unconsolidated sediments thickness estimation of a site 

while the shape of the H/V curve, with some supplementary information, is utilized for the shear 

wave velocity profile retrieval through inversion. In this study we are going to investigate the 

aspects of joint inversion on H/V and dispersion curves which have not been evaluated in detail 

yet, such as it is usually whispered that the peak of H/V provides a good estimative of the shear 

wave resonance frequency, even when the H/V curve is considered a proxy for Rayleigh wave 

ellipticity. If this is the case, we will try to check the deviation of shear wave resonance 

frequency deviation from the H/V peak frequency by forward modeling, considering the noise 

wavefield as completely dominated by Rayleigh waves, surface waves (both Love and Rayleigh 

waves)  and equal contribution of body and surface waves (diffuse field). We will also try to list 

all the parameters (shear wave velocity, primary wave velocity, thickness and density of mass) 

which affect the shift of the peak frequency from the shear wave resonance frequency. 

The other important use of the peak frequency is to derive a thickness-peak frequency regression 

relationship of an interest area. This thickness-peak frequency relationship can be used to obtain 

the soil deposit thickness by measuring seismic noise at a site and inputting the peak frequency 

of the H/V to the derived relationship. To obtain this thickness-peak frequency relationship, we 

must have some borehole control points where the detailed information of the soil deposit is 

available. The H/V curves are obtained at each control site and then the peak frequency is related 

to the soil thickness through the regression relationship. However, in the field it is difficult to 

have the borehole as a control point for calibration. We will try to use dispersion curve of 

Rayleigh wave and derived thickness-peak frequency relationship to analyze the role of borehole 

control points if not available in the investigation area.  

The H/V curve shape deviates from the Rayleigh wave ellipticity due to the presence of the 

fraction Love and body waves in the noise wavefield. We will try to remove or minimize the 

effect of the Love and body waves presence on the noise wavefield and make the shape of the 

H/V curve closer to the Rayleigh ellipticity shape. The inversion of the H/V curve alone for the 

shear wave velocity retrieval always had a trade-off between S-wave velocity and thickness 

estimative. To overcome this trade-off some prior information is needed. The dispersion curve 

will be analyzed to obtain the velocity increase trend which can be used to overcome this trade-

off between thickness and S-wave velocity by inverting the ellipticity alone. The part of the H/V 

curve which carries the most important information regarding the subsurface ground structure is 

necessarily analyzed. The most ambiguous problem in all the surface wave inversion problem is 



 
 

3 
 

how to fix the subsurface layers prior to the inversion. This is very tricky to answer, however, we 

tried to find the sensitivity of ellipticity (H/V) curve shape deviation to layers within the earth. 

The joint inversion of the H/V for the deep soil S-wave velocity profile retrieval is also very 

necessary. Usually, there is no role to define weight of misfit for this two different targets. We 

will try to design a weight function for both targets to find the misfit of the joint inversion in a 

way to account the number of sample data available for each target (dispersion and H/V curves). 

All the observation of the analysis will be tested on three different sites in São Paulo state, 

Brazil, to jointly invert the H/V and dispersion curves. 

 

1.2 Organization of the thesis 

 

The thesis is organized in two main sections. One (Chapters 2-5) dealing with the theoretical 

background from literature, while the second section (Chapters 6-10) is the analysis and the 

results of the study. Chapter 1 describes the general introduction, objectives and the organization 

of the thesis. Chapter 2 is about the origin of seismic noise, techniques used for its analysis and 

its application for near surface are highlighted. Chapter 3: a brief introduction to the H/V 

methods, it has a theoretical summary and the practical aspects of the data analysis are discussed. 

Chapter 4: The array technique used for surface wave, especially Rayleigh wave analysis, is 

described in detail for the SASW and MASW. Chapter 5: the inversion algorithm used for the 

study is explained briefly (how the parameter space is modeled and how the new model is 

generated). The modeling technique of the H/V curve is described in Chapter 6, where the noise 

wavefield is considered to be dominated by the Body waves, Rayleigh waves, only considering 

the effect of both Love and body waves, and by the diffused wave field situation.  

The analysis of the peak frequency of H/V curve is discussed in Chapter 7 by the forward 

modeling. The sensitivity of the peak frequency against Poisson ratio, Vs, Vp, thickness (h) and 

density (   is analyzed, so is the sensitivity of the H/V curve for different number of layers. 

Chapter 8 describes the thickness-peak frequency relation for the 7 borehole sites at the 

Bebedouro area (one of the study areas). The MASW dispersion curves are used to obtain the 

shear wave velocity increase trend of the area. These information are used to obtain the 

thickness-frequency relation and then compared with the borehole and H/V peak-frequency 

relation experimentally derived. Chapter 9 is about the analysis of part of ellipticity which is 

carrying the most relevant information regarding the subsurface structure. The misfit function is 

discussed and defined for the joint inversion of ellipticity and dispersion curve. Finally, Chapter 

10 describes the results of the joint inversion on three studied sites: IAG, Colônia and 

Bebedouro.

Chapter 2: A review of seismic noise 

2. Introduction 

The term microzonation is a very familiar expression frequently used in seismology and 

earthquake engineering for seismically active area classifications. The microzonation is actually 

the characterization and division of the seismically active area into sub-regions on the basis of 

predicted risk in case of earthquake damage. This analysis is made as precautions to mitigate 

hazard and safely design of the infrastructure and dwelling (water and gas pipelines, electricity 

distribution, schools, hospitals and roads/bridges infrastructures). For the microzonation studies, 

the velocity model, especially shear wave velocity structure, has a great importance, since it is 

actually responsible for the major destruction. This velocity model helps in quantifying how 

destructive the effect of the surface wave will be in the case of an earthquake occurrence. So, the 

velocity model of the structure information is the prime interest for the microzonation. 

Unfortunately, this microzonation is desired to be performed on the urbanized area where it is 

difficult to employ conventional geophysical techniques. To overcome this problem, passive and 

non-destructive active methods, like spectral analysis of surface saves (SASW) and multichannel 

analysis of surface waves (MASW), are developed, which are based on the ambient seismic 

noise recording and hammer seismic, respectively, and can be easily implemented on urbanized 

area. Prioritizing to describe that technique, in brief, we present a review of the nature of seismic 

noise. First, an attempt will be made to explain the term seismic noise, its nature and its different 

aspects. Later, the techniques that use seismic noise for the geophysical and engineering 

applications. 

2.1 Seismic noise 

The scientists that deals with measured/recorded data such as seismologists often use the term 

noise for the unwanted portion of data. The seismic noise is considered as a random and non-

deterministic process in nature. It is considered non-deterministic because it is very difficult to 

mathematically formulate the randomness of the process that generates it or, as we may say, it 

seems random to us because we do not know all the processes which contribute in the generation 

of it.  

The main signal in seismology is the earthquake record, which is used to model the earth 

properties from the mechanical vibration signal produced by the earthquake.  The dynamic 

nature of the Earth is supported by the fact that its surface is constantly modified by some of its 

internal and external processes along the geologic time scale. The earthquake is one of the main 

evidence presented to support this claim, however, an earthquake is not the only proof of its 

vibrant nature. There is a permanent small amplitude vibration that causes very small 

displacements. This permanent vibration on the surface of the Earth could not be related to the 

earthquake, so it is termed as seismic noise by the seismologists. So our first goal, here, is: try to 



 
 

5 
 

understand the origin of the seismic noise from the literature review. Before the advent of 

standard instrumentation for the recording of earthquakes, the studies made on the analysis of 

seismic noise were mainly qualitatives, however, soon after the development of instrumentation 

and technical facilities such as the computers, Kanai (1954), Aki (1957) and Akamatsu (1961) 

were the first researchers who pointed out that the soil characteristics can be inferred from the 

analysis of seismic ambient noise.  This opened a corridor toward the precise understanding of 

nature of the seismic noise wavefield and its use for the subsurface information retrieval. This 

reminds an old saying “One man noise is another man signal”. Scales &amp;amp; Snieder (1998) 

consider the transcription “noise is that part of the data that we choose not to explain”. 

2.2. Seismic sources of noise 

Generally, the seismic noise wavefield is the superposition of many seismic signals generated by 

various natural and man-made sources. The seismic noise wavefield is unpredictable because we 

do not know the different sources, and if the sources are known, then we are unaware of each 

source contribution to the noise wavefield. The natural  sources of seismic noise, in general, are 

ocean tides, water-waves striking the coast, standing water waves in the open seas due to storm 

systems, air pressure changes, turbulent wind or wind-induced vibrations of trees or tall 

buildings and man-made sources such as car and train traffic, industrial machines, explosions or 

the exploitation of underground reservoirs e.g. hydrocarbons, geothermal (Sesame, 2004). 

A comprehensive and complete literature review of the current knowledge about the seismic 

noise wave field is given by Bonnefoy-Claudet et al. (2004, 2006a). They have shown that 

although many kinds of noise sources exist, they can be easily classified in a simple term: the 

natural and anthropogenic sources. Concerning the origin of the noise, Gutenberg (1958) lists the 

different types of sources according to the frequency of the relevant seismic motion. Several 

years later, other authors got the same conclusions (Asten, 1978; Asten &amp;amp; Henstridge, 1984). A 

summary about the frequency dependency of noise sources is shown in Table 2.1 

 Gutenberg  1958 Asten 1978-1984 

Waves striking at Coast 0.01-0.5Hz 0.5-1.2Hz

Cyclone over ocean 0.3-1Hz 0.5-3Hz 

Local metrological conditions 1.4-5Hz ------ 

Volcanic tremor 2-10 Hz ------ 

Urban 1-100 Hz 1.3-30 Hz 

Table 2. 1: Summary of noise sources according to frequency after Gutenberg (1958) and Asten (1978, 1984) (from 

SESAME Project, report WP08, 2003). 

Almost all the authors working on the problem of understanding the nature of seismic noise 

wavefield agreed that the boundary between man-made noise and natural noise is around 1 Hz. 

Below one Hz (&lt;1Hz ?Long-period ) noise is termed as microseism and above one Hz (&gt;1Hz 

?short-period) noise is termed as microtremor. The term microseism and microtremor are not 



 
 

6 
 

fully used in the literature of seismology. We will try to use these both terms for seismic noise 

wave-field equally in some places at this study. Information listed in Table 2.1 can be described 

in terms of frequency.  It is possible to see from this short summary that surface waves are an 

essential component of seismic noise. In fact, even if their importance decrease with the increase 

of frequency, their role is always significant from the Table 2.1. It can be observed that, at 

frequencies below 0.5 Hz, the sources are natural (ocean, large-scale meteorological conditions). 

So, at low frequencies, seismic noise is generally stable, it has high coherence, and consists 

mainly of surface waves. In the intermediate frequency range between 0.5 to 1 Hz, sources are 

both natural (local meteorological conditions) and anthropogenic (urban). Thus, in this case, the 

noise is less stable and the fraction of the surface waves is variable. Finally, for frequencies 

higher than 1 Hz, sources are essentially anthropogenic. As a consequence of the elevated 

variability of the anthropogenic sources, at high frequencies, the seismic noise is extremely 

unstable both in amplitude and in terms of the ratio between body and surface waves. 

2.3 The composition of noise wavefield 

 

The seismic noise field is assumed to be dominated by surface wave field as demonstrated by 

some studies (Douze, 1964; Bormann 2012). Bonnefoy-Claudet et al. (2006a) made an extensive 

review of the composition of the noise wavefield. Here, the developments made in this direction 

are listed and discussed, such as their uses for the engineering applications. The seismic noise 

wavefield was believed, and it is still the case, to be dominated by the fundamental mode of 

Rayleigh waves. The ocean generated double frequency noise wavefield, that is considered to be 

the main source of seismic noise wavefield (Gutenberg, 1911; Longuet-Higgins, 1950). The 

dominancy of noise field by the Rayleigh wave fundamental mode is considered true for the 

most cases of ocean-generated noise wave field within a period of 5-20 s (Brooks et al., 2009). 

The characteristic of this important noise generated source is assigned to be the same for the 

shortest and longest period dominated by this noise generation sources. 

Due to the development of seismic noise wavefield recording sensors (3component seismometer) 

and processing ease due to the modern computer, it is observed that seismic noise field contain 

both body and surface waves. At lower frequencies (0.04 to 0.15 Hz) the noise wavefield is 

dominated by Rayleigh and Love waves fundamental modes (Lacoss et al. 1969; Kurrle &amp;amp; 

Widmer, 2008).  Generally, for the natural sources of seismic noise wavefield, it consists on 

higher mode of Rayleigh waves, along with dominated fundamental mode (Brooks et al., 2009), 

Love waves (Saito, 2010) and a fraction of body waves (Koper et al., 2010). So, noise wavefield 

composition is debatable and one can simply narrow down its nature search by asking and 

finding some answers to the questions likes (SESAME, 2004):  1. What is the proportion of body 

and surface wave energies in noise wavefield? If dominated by a surface wave then, 2. What are 

the relative fractions of the Rayleigh and Love waves in noise wavefield? 3. If the seismic wave 

noise wavefield is dominated by Rayleigh waves then what is the relation of fundamental mode 

to higher mode Rayleigh wave energy?  



 
 

7 
 

The answer to the question 1 can be sought out from two study analysis (Douze, 1964; Bormann, 

2012) carried out with seismic noise and earthquake recording analysis done with sensors 

installed both at the surface and in the boreholes at different depth levels. The surface-wave 

nature of seismic noise is the reason for the exponential decay of noise amplitudes with depth, 

which is not the case for body waves (Fig.2.1). Douze (1964) analyzed the noise measurement in 

an abandoned oil well at the surface and at different depths with a vertical short period 

seismometer. The ratio of Fourier spectral amplitude at depth over the surface spectral amplitude 

ratio decreased significantly at 0.25-3 s period (Fig.2.1), which suggests the surface wave 

dominancy of noise wavefield. Above the 3s period, the ratio of spectral amplitude for depth to  

surface are nearly 1, which suggests that for those frequencies decay should occur at higher 

depth (Fig.2.1). Another study (Bormann, 2012) performed with the same propose to check the 

nature of noise wavefield was done with recording at the surface and depth (Fig 2.2). 

 

Fig.2. 1Deep-to-surface noise Fourier spectra amplitude ratio (vertical component) as a function of period  (taken 

from.  Douze, 1964). 

 
Fig.2. 2 Recording of seismic noise (left) and earthquake signals (right) at the surface and at different depth levels of 

a borehole (from Bormann 2012). 

Similarly, the penetration depth of surface waves increases with wavelength and high-frequency 

noise attenuates more rapidly with depth. In the case of (Fig.2.3) the noise power at 300m depth 

in a borehole was reduced, as compared to the surface, by about 10 dB at f = 0.5 Hz, 20 dB at 1 



 
 

8 
 

Hz and 35 dB at 10 Hz. This continuous amplitude decline with frequency is in accordance with 

the surface waves nature of seismic noise. However, the noise amplitude drop, as well as the 

signal behavior, with depth and it also depended on the local geological conditions. Withers et al. 

(1996) found that for frequencies between 10 to 20 Hz, the SNR (signal to noise ratio) could be 

improved between 10 to 20 dB and for frequencies between 23 and 55 Hz as much as 20 to 40 

dB by deploying a short-period sensor at only 45m below the surface.

borehole (below) near Gorleben, Germany (taken from Bormann, 2012) 

To deal with the second question, some empirical studies were done seeking to find the fraction 

energy of the Rayleigh and Love waves in noise field. As early as 1980, most of the researchers 

focused their attention to find the fraction of Rayleigh to Love ratio from the analysis of noise 

wavefield recorded on vertical component (Li et al., 1984; Horike, 1985; Yamanaka et al., 1994). 

The results of these studies showed an agreement in one aspect that microseism (&lt;1Hz) are 

mainly dominated by Rayleigh waves, and at high frequency (&gt; 1Hz) a combination of Love and 

Rayleigh waves exists. However, two other studies (Arai et al., 1998 and Yamamoto, 2000) 

performed on the same subject have shown very unclear results about the fraction of Rayleigh-

to-Love waves (see for example Table 2.2). The outcome of their analysis is that at 

anthropogenic region (urban site) the fraction of Love energy is more than Rayleigh energy 

(Table 2.2). 

 Rayleigh waves(%) Love waves(%) Frequency range(%)

The three component sensor array analysis, frequency-wavenumber (F-K) and spatial 

autocorrelation (SPAC) analysis helps to identify the fraction of Rayleigh to Love wave in noise 

wavefield (Arai and Tokimatsu, 1998-2000; Köhler et al., 2007; Endrun et al., 2010). Arai and 

Tokimatsu (1998, 2000) tried to find the comparative fraction of  Rayleigh and Love waves and 

this fraction dependence on frequency from 3-c sensor array analysis for four sites in Japan A: 

Yumenoshima (Tokyo), B: Rokko Island (Kobe), C: Asahi (Kushiro), D: Kotobuki (Kushiro). 

They applied both the frequency-wave-number (F-K) and spatial auto-correlation method 

(SPAC) approach (Fig.2.4). The ratio of (Rayleigh/Love)FK and (Rayleigh/Love)SPAC  is 0.4 to 1 

for the period 0.1-5 s. The fraction of the ratio is concluded to be 0.7 (0.41/0.59). Hence, for 

frequencies higher than 1 Hz (cultural noise), the noise wavefields consists around 60% Love 

waves and 40% Rayleigh waves in that area. Another study done by Cornou (2002) showed from 

the 3-c array data analysis that the energy ratio for each radial and transverse component is 

around 50% each. She estimated that the proportion of energy carried by Rayleigh waves 

through the ratio of the energy carried by radial and transverse components is around 50% of 

Rayleigh waves for frequency range from 0.2 to 1 Hz. 

 

 
Fig.2. 4 Rayleigh to Love waves fraction for four sites, from 3-c array data for FK (a) and for SAC (b) analysis  

(Arai and Tokimatsu, 1998). 

About the third question, the actual energy distribution for various modes of Rayleigh waves is 

almost impossible to predict due to the heterogeneous ground conditions (Bonnefoy-Claudet et 

al., 2006). The Rayleigh wave higher modes existences in the seismic noise wavefield are not 

very well investigated. Indirect information of Rayleigh wave higher modes dominancy can be 

achieved from the Horizontal-over-Vertical spectral ratio (H/V) method. Yamanka et al. (1994) 

performed a study with continuous noise recording in Japan (Kanto plain). They observed that 

H/V closely match with the fundamental mode of Rayleigh wave ellipticity, which lead them to 



 
 

10 
 

conclude that noise wavefield is dominated by fundamental mode of  Rayleigh waves. Two other 

studies, Stephenson (2003) and Konno &amp;amp; Ohmachi (1998) concluded that if the noise wavefield 

is dominated by fundamental mode of Rayleigh wave then the H/V curve should have a clear 

peak and trough for the site. 

Tokimatsu (1997) analyzed the Rayleigh wave displacement equation for synthetic noise at a 

simple model (horizontal layered, elastic and homogeneous medium over a half space), 

theoretical dispersion curve was estimated for the model. He characterized the model by 3 

different S-wave velocity profiles for different stiffness values with depth, stiffness changing 

regularly (increases and decreases cases Fig. 2.5 a). Tokimatsu observed that in case 2 and case 3 

the computed dispersion curve (obtained from synthetic noise) does not perfectly match the 

theoretical one for fundamental mode, however in case 1 (increasing velocity with depth), the 

theoretical and computed curves for the model match very reasonable. He observed that one 

higher mode or multiple higher modes played a significant role in various frequency ranges. 

Hence, depending on the geological characteristics of the soil (especially due to the presence of 

velocity inversions at depth) higher modes can be excited in seismic noise (if mainly made of 

surface wave).

The corresponding dispersion curves (dots) computed from noise synthetics in case 1 (b), case 2 (c) and case 3 (d) 

are compared with theoretical disperion curves of higher mode Rayleigh waves (after Tokimatsu 1997).

2.4 Techniques used for seismic noise 
 

The seismic noise wavefield is utilized for different purposes at different levels. The first real 

techniques, which were developed for the seismic noise analysis, are array analysis like Spatial 

Autocorrelation (SPAC), Aki (1957-1965), and the frequency-wavenumber analysis technique, 

F-K, (Capon et al., 1967-1969). We can also cite the single 3 component method introduced by 

Nogoshi &amp;amp; Igrashi (1971) to estimate the site effect properties for the mechanical vibration like 

an earthquake, and very recently, the Green function is used for the same purpose of the site 

effect fundamental period and shear wave velocity estimation (Sanche Sesma, 2011; Pina Flores, 

2017). We briefly explain the F-K and SPAC in coming section. In seismology, a 2D array 

(SPAC and F-K method) of seismic sensors is used to capture the full wave field for the velocity 

and azimuth information retrieval at an investigated site. 1D array of sensors only records the 

wave field that is on the direction of the array line while fail to capture both the velocity and 

azimuth information. To resolve the azimuth, the horizontal component of the wave field should 

be properly resolved. For each array technique, the basic principle is to find the arrival delay at 

each station for an incident wavefront. Each wavefront reaches different sensors at a different 

time. From this time delay, the slowness or the velocity information are obtained. In the case of 

vertically incident wavefield, a 2D array will record the apparent velocity or slowness and this 

apparent velocity is strongly affected by the incidence angle from the vertical. Therefore, a 3D 

array is needed to capture the velocity, azimuth and incidence angle information. This 3D array 

is usually achieved by installing sensors in a borehole at a depth equivalent to the length of the 

2D array on the surface. To the surface wave (both Love and Rayleigh waves) that travels along 

the horizontal direction, a 2D array is sufficient to analyzed surface waves. 

2.4.1 Spatial autocorrelation (SPAC) method 

SPAC method was developed by Aki (1957, 1965) for seismic noise analysis which helps in 

characterizing the nature of the noise wavefield and wave propagation characteristics of a site. 

Aki considered the seismic noise wave as a stationary and random process both in time and 

space. Hence, two further assumptions are made that the wave field is made of superimposed 

isotropic waves propagating with same phase velocities for certain frequency, but with different 

powers in all directions, in a horizontal plane. The second assumption is that waves with 

different frequencies and propagation directions are independents. Taken all these assumptions 

into consideration the spatial correlation of ground motion at two location u(a,t) and u(b,t) is 

given by Aki (1957) as: 

                                          (2.1) 

 

Here          is the recorded signal at location (a,b), t is time,   is azimuth and r is the 

distance. The time and space spectrum relation for a wavefront of single mode traveling along 

the azimuth   is given as: 

 



 
 

12 
 

       
 

 
         

  

    
         

 

 
        (2.2) 

 

     is the power spectrum of the wave in time,      is the phase velocity,   is the angular 

frequency. A power spectrum term,     , which can be filtered with band filter at a central 

frequency    is given as: 

 

                           (2.3) 

 

where      is spectral power density,   is dirac function. Using these values in Eq.2.2 result as: 

 

          
 

 
          

   

     
               (2.4) 

 

This spatial correlation in Eq.2.4 is normalized by the autocorrelation of a central station and a 

new spatial correlation is given as: 

  

          
         

         
         (2.5) 

 

upon putting its value will reduce Eq.2.5 to 

  

              
   

     
                             (2.6) 

 

In Eq.2.6 
 

     
                   shows the time delay between different sensors. The 

shape of spatial-correlation function,  , can easily sketch the wave propagation direction 

(Fig2.6). 

 



 
 

13 
 

 
Fig.2. 6 The shape of the spatial correlation function. The function shows a constant value and abruptly decreases 

with increase in frequency in the propagation direction (from Okada 2003). 

 

For experimental point of view, Aki (1957) suggested to use a circular array of radius r and 

install the station at regular space with respect to the central station (Fig.2.7). 

 
Fig.2. 7 Diagram of a circular array with an incident plane wave arriving under an azimuth angle (from Hobiger 

2011). 

The function for this circular array is azimuthally average  as 

 

   
 

 
         

 

 
         (2.7) 

 

and in more general form Okada (2003) expressed Eq.2.7 as 



 
 

14 
 

  

    
 

 
          

  

    
         

 

 

 

 
         (2.8) 

 

the term in Eq.2.8      
  

    
         

 

 
   is the Bessel function first kind of zero order   . 

Then Eq.2.8 can reduced to 

 

    
 

 
        

  

    
 

 

 
          (2.9) 

 

Similar like Eq.2.5 the normalized spatial correlation function is given as  

 

           
   

     
         (2.10) 

 

This derivation is detailed in Aki (1957).  Eq.2.10 provides a way to compute the phase velocity 

when the average of the spatial-correlation function is made for fixed r. Naturally, if data 

recorded on several circles with different radio are available, an azimuthally average can be 

computed for each circle, and for a fixed frequency f, using r as the independent variable 

(Chavez-Garcia,2005). This Eq.2.10 provides a dispersion curve which can be inverted to obtain 

the ground structure. 

2.4.2 Frequency-wavenumber analysis 

Frequency wave number method was developed by Capon et al. (1967) and Lacoss et al. (1969). 

This method was initially developed to detect nuclear explosion using seismic network LASA 

(large aperture seismic array) which has a diameter of 200 km (Okada 2003). This helps out to 

single out a predominant seismic wave from a mixture of other waves disregarding its nature. 

This method works for both body and surface wave analysis. Applying to the surface wave 

analysis, in the case of seismic noise, the main assumption is made that wave field is dominated 

by surface waves. 

To describe the kernel of this procedure let assumed a single incident plane wave arriving at N 

sensors with its position as  and the corresponding slowness vector for delay arrival at all sensors 

is given as product of slowness vector with the positions vector within array. The first sensor 

position of the array system is considered as the origin. In this situation, the recording for a 

single-component for all the sensors is given as: 

            
                 

 

 
       (2.11) 

 

where      is wave complex amplitude (frequency dependant). The signal vector of the array 

can be define as  

 



 
 

15 
 

       

  
  
 

  

 =               
       

 

 
      (2.12) 

 

Where, in 2.12, R are the sensors locations given as a matrix (the size of R is N 3). By taking 

the Fourier transform of signal vector yield as: 

 

     
 

   
            

        
             

 

  

 

  

   

 
 

   
            

     
    

 

  

       
        

 

  

   

 
 

   
            

     
    

 

  

           

 
 

   
                       (2.13) 

if 
    

   
       is the origin sensor Fourier transform and the wave vector is given as       

         then 2.13 reduced to  

 

           
               (2.14) 

 

     is multiplied by a steering vector                   which takes all the element of 

     in phase and then sum it. 

Application of seismic noise           energy is estimated as: 

 

                         (2.15) 

 

        
        

 

  
       

 

       (2.16) 

 

        
  

 

 
                     

 

        
 =           (2.17) 

 

A grid search is performed for all values of k and trying to recognize the maximum energy  for a 

correct wave vector . The second term in 2.17 is known as an array response function which 

corresponds to a zero vector incident wave or, more simply, the wave is arriving at an incident 

angle of zero which corresponds to infinite velocity. Frequency wave number method 

characterized the seismic noise wave field by determining the apparent velocity and direction of 

maximum propagating waves. FK method is used mainly to determine the Rayleigh wave 

dispersion curve with vertical seismic sensors because  in 3 component sensors case, horizontal 



 
 

16 
 

component requires a rotation for radial and tranverse component which is not an easy task 

(Lacoss et al., 1969 Fah et al 2008). There is one other technique that uses seismic noise for site 

investigation. It is the H/V spectral curve technique. The H/V will be explained in detail in 

separate chapters (chapter 3). 

There is a variety of seismic noise application ranging for environmental applications to 

earthquake engineering and oil and gas exploration. The most common techniques utilized for 

these purposes are a single sensor and the array techniques. The main feature of seismic noise, on 

which most of these techniques are based, is the spectral analysis of seismic noise and its 

variation both in space and time.   

For the environmental studies, the main application of seismic noise is its use for the 

environmental monitoring. The global climate changes and tried to observe the temporal 

variation of seismic noise (Grevemeyer, 2000; Aster et al., 2008), as one of the main sources of 

seismic noise are an ocean related process like ocean swell and tides, and all these processes are 

directly related to the climatic condition. The change in global climate is observed with the 

temporal variation of continuous seismic noise recording. Gross et al. (2009) utilized seismic 

noise for local and regional scale metrological variation like air pressure and wind speed 

changes. Burtin et al. (2008) analyzed seismic noise spectral amplitude variation with time and 

space to observe the hydrodynamics of the river to its transported bedload. The use of seismic 

noise for seismic interferometry is another important application. This interferometric study is 

performed by measuring the Green function from the cross-correlation of coherent wave field 

between any two receivers of seismic noise recording and trying to observe its variation with 

time. This approach is used for the analysis of seismic velocities changes at fault zones 

(Brenguier et al., 2008b) and at volcanoes sites (Brenguier et al., 2008a). The cross-correlation of 

the seismic noise recording converges to Green function when the seismic noise wavefield is 

assumed to be equipartitioned (equal contribution of surface and body waves) (Gouédard et al., 

2008a).  

 

In earthquake engineering, seismic noise is often used to analyze the site based specific 

properties like shear wave velocity, which is the most important parameter in microzonation for 

earthquake hazard mitigation. The other applications are an estimative guess of the thickness of 

soil package, the direction of maximum slope inland sliding prone areas and site based vibration 

amplification. The retrieval of the 1D shear wave velocity profile with depth are achieved 

through array techniques like SPAC, multi-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW), spectral 

analysis of surface wave (SASW) and frequency-wavenumber (FK) method. In all these 

methods, dispersion curves are obtained and later, they are inverted to obtained the S-wave 

velocity profile. H/V is another very important technique used to study the frequencies around,  

the maximum amplification of the bedrock motion is expected to occur at a local site (will be 

discussed in detail in next chapter).

The most commercialized application of seismic noise is its utilization in the hydrocarbon 

industry. Some studies have shown the possibility of using seismic noise analysis as direct 

hydrocarbon indicator (DHI) for hydrocarbon reservoir (Mohammed et al., 2007). It is observed 

that within the frequency ranges of 1 to 4 Hz, the H/V ratio and spectral amplitude of recorded 

seismic noise changes with the presence of hydrocarbon reservoir in the subsurface.  However, 

there is no univocal agreement among the researcher for this specific usage. A study over the 

hydrocarbon reservoir concluded that the variation in H/V and spectral amplitude variation at the 

site are more affected by seismic noise produced by local sources like hydrocarbon exploitation 

activity and not as DHI (Hanssen &amp;amp; Bussat 2008). However, this seems a very interesting 

application and may need further study for the detailed insight.

Chapter 3:  Review of the H/V spectral curve method 
 

H/V (horizontal-to-vertical) spectral ratio is a fast way to characterize a site for engineering 

application from the ambient noise measurement with a single 3-component sensor on the Earth 

surface. The method is used for a rapid estimation of fundamental resonance frequency  of a site 

around which the maximum displacement amplification is expected to occur in case of shakes 

induced by an earthquake. The technique can be summarized as: a three-component sensor 

(seismometer) used to record the ground motion induced by natural seismic noise. The Fourier 

spectra of all the three (east-west, north-south and vertical) components are find out. The 

horizontal (east-west, north-south) components are averaged out and divided by the vertical one. 

  

        
             

      
        (3.1) 

 

where        is the Fourier amplitude spectra of the vertical  motion and        and        

are the spectra of two horizontal components at frequency  . Both the horizontal components are 

averaged either by geometrical mean or quadratic mean. 

 

This spectral amplitude ratio (Eq.3.1) is plotted as a function of frequency which usually results 

in a peak (depending on the subsurface configuration). This peak corresponds to the S-wave 

resonance frequency of the site. The shear wave resonance frequency within a layer of thickness 

h is one-quarter of the wavelength of shear wave within the layer (Mooney et al 1966; 

Malischewsky &amp;amp; Sherbaum, 2004). This peak of the H/V curve is used extensively for the site 

effect characterization and for quick estimation of its fundamental resonance (Sing, 2014-2015 

and 2017; Shokry, 2016). The advantage of this method is that it can be used in the areas where 

the earthquake seismic activity is not so frequent, in such case, the recording of the seismic noise 

achieved the required goal. 

Here, in this chapter, it will be given the historical overview of the method. And later a brief 

outline of the H/V formula derived by Malischewsky &amp;amp; Sherbaum (2004) from the wave 

equation for homogeneous half space and a layer over half space situation, following by the 

processing of seismic noise from the SESAME (2004) recommendations to get the reliable H/V 

curve. 

3.1 Historical overview of the H/V curve 

Kanai and Tanaka (1961) were the first researchers to use the seismic noise horizontal 

component Fourier spectra for the subsurface characterization. Their conclusion was that seismic 

natural noise properties depend both on the mechanical properties of a site and sources of 

seismic noise. Later, Nogoshi and Igarashi (1971) used the horizontal over vertical spectral ratio 



 
 

19 
 

to infer the site properties, however, their work was published in Japanese so the rest of the 

scientific community did not notice it. This method was familiarized by Nakamura in 1989, 

which is actually the reason that some of the researchers called it Nakamura method. 

The H/V curve methods are extensively used for various purposes. Harutoonian (2012) used it 

for the soil compaction evaluation. Stankoe et al. (2017) showed that directional analysis of the 

H/V might provide the link to the presence of near subsurface faults. Mohammed et al. (2007) 

and Saenger et al. (2009) used this method to link it to the presence of hydrocarbon within the 

subsurface. Though all these applications of the H/V spectral curve seem very intriguing, the 

most commonly adopted application of the H/V curve is its utilization for the near subsurface 

characterization. The H/V curve is used very extensively to retrieve 1D shear wave velocity 

profile by the joint inversion with the dispersion curve (Scherbaum et al., 2003, Arai &amp;amp; 

Tokimatsu 2004, Parolai et al., 2005, Piccozi et al., 2005 and Hobiger et al., 2013). Scherbaum et 

al. (2003) showed that dispersion curve inversion can be improved by the inclusion of the peak 

of the H/V curve for deeper soil deposit. Arai &amp;amp; Tokimatsu (2004) showed that thickness of the 

soft sediments can be retrieved if the absolute shear wave velocity of the site is known in 

priority. Parolai et al. (2005) showed a very similar result that dispersion and Rayleigh wave 

ellipticity have a different sensitivity to the soil layers.  

The two most important features of the H/V curve often used for the near-subsurface application 

is the peak and the shape of the curve. The peak frequency is used for the fundamental resonance 

frequency, thickness and the average shear wave velocity estimation of the soil package, while 

the shape of the H/V curve, along with some supplementary information, is utilized for the shear 

wave velocity profile retrieval through inversion. In this study, we are going to investigate the 

aspect of joint inversion of the H/V and dispersion curves which have not been evaluated in 

detail yet (discussed in objectives and summary of the thesis in detail). For example, it is usually 

whispered that the peak of H/V provides a good estimative of shear wave resonance frequency 

even when H/V curve is considered as proxy for the Rayleigh wave ellipticity. If this is the case, 

we will try to check the deviation between shear wave resonance frequency from the H/V peak 

frequency by forward modeling. 

3.2  Formula of the H/V curve  

 

The first attempt to model and formulate the H/V curve mathematically was made by 

Malischewsky et al., (2004, 2008). Malischewsky tried to explicitly derive a formula for the H/V 

curve from the wave equation, for the Rayleigh wave traveling through different situations like 

in homogeneous half-space, and a layer of thickness d over the half-space. The complete 

algebraic derivation of the formula is lengthy, especially for a layer over the half-space, and can 

be found in Malischewsky et a.l (2004). Here it will be listed briefly.

The propagation of Rayleigh wave along homogeneous and inhomogeneous surfaces of half 

space is a well-understood phenomenon. The displacement of particles under the influence of 

Rayleigh waves has two orthogonal components, one horizontal along the direction of 

propagation while the other component is directed downward along the depth axis. The ratio of 

these two displacements eigenfunctions at the surface of homogeneous or inhomogeneous half-

space is termed as ellipticity of Rayleigh wave. The shape of the ellipticity is linked to an elastic 

parameter of the subsurface and it is therefore considered an important parameter for engineering 

problems.  

To derive the formula of the H/V for the homogenous half-space we are using the notation of 

Malischewsky et al. (2004, 2008). Consider a homogeneous half-space in a Cartesian coordinate 

system, where the origin of a two-dimensional Rayleigh wave motion is located on the surface of 

half space. The wave motion direction assumed is from left to right, the horizontal displacement 

in the x-direction is given by x1, while vertical component of displacement x3 is directed into the 

half-space (z-direction). The displacement ui in case of no-body forces for homogenous, elastic 

and isotropic medium can be characterized by Lame parameter     and density   as

in the case of a layer over half-space, is lengthy and algebraically complicated, and can be found 

in Malischewsky et al. (2004, 2006, 2008). The expression for the final formula of a layer with

wave velocity in layer of thickness d. The result of a layer over half-space (Fig.2.2) shows that

3.3 The experimental procedure for the H/V measurement 

The experimental procedure for the H/V curve analysis is quite simple. As discussed above, a 

three-component sensor is used to record the seismic ambient noise placed on the surface of the 

Earth at an investigated site. The type of sensor generally recommended is a short period sensor, 

as broadband sensor requires a large time for stabilization prior to the effective recording. The 

accelerometer is not recommended for the noise measurement as its response below 1 Hz is very 

unstable. If the investigated site has an expected frequency lower than the natural frequency of 

the short period sensor, the result might not be reliable. In such cases, a sensor with lower natural 

frequency is recommended for the larger duration. The recommendations for the experimental 

recording and processing procedure were firstly suggested by Mucciarelli (1998) and Bard 

(1999), later SESAME (Site EffectS assessment using AMbient Excitations 2004) refined the 

recording and processing protocol in a comprehensive way. Similarly, another reliability 

classification scheme was developed later by Albarello et al. (2011) to quality check the recorded 

noise data. This new classification includes some additional recommendations to that proposed 

by the SESAME. The data recorded with the three-component sensor is processed initially such 

as 

1. Offset removal-means that the whole signal is deducted from the each sample; 

2. The signal is divided into a number of windows            , whose length is chosen such 

that the window must have 10 significant cycles for the frequency of interest    
  

  
 ,    is the 

expected fundamental frequency of the site,    is the length of time window in seconds. The 

stable portion of the signal is chosen with the help of short time average (STA) and long time 

average (LTA), this helps to avoid choosing the transient portion of the signal. The following 

steps of the process are applied to the selected windows, as recommended by SESAME 2004: 

(a) for all the components Vertical, North-South and East-West, a cosine taper of 5% is applied 

at each end of the window; 

(b) FFT is performed for each window of all the three components and the spectral amplitudes 

are estimated at each frequency (0.2 to 20 Hz); 

(c) the spectral of each component are smoothened by the Kohno and Ohmachi (1998) 

smoothing function of bandwidth 30; 



 
 

26 
 

(d) both the horizontal components (NS and EW) are averaged by quadratic, which means 

                      
        

          
 

 
        (3.21) 

(e) the merged horizontal component is divided by the vertical component for each frequency to 

obtain the H/V ratio amplitude. The H/V ratio amplitude is plotted as a function of frequency as 

shown in Fig 3.4 (Note: a sufficient number of windows are required for the good statistical 

control for all the process steps from (a) to (e). In each of the n windows the log of ratio of 

spectral amplitudes for merged horizontal and vertical is obtained as function of frequency); 

3. The mean H/V ratio is obtained from all the windows selected by 

                   
   

 
           

          
        (3.22) 

(Average standard deviation is estimated by the relation) 

 

                 
      

 
                      

 
        

            
      (3.23) 

 

After this initial processing, a statistical analysis is performed to check the reliability of the H/V 

curve and peak clarity condition as suggested by SESAME (2004). The reliability criteria for the 

H/V curve were found (Fig 3.4e) which shows that whether the curve obtained with the analyzed 

recorded noise is the true representative of the site and another seismic noise record at the site 

will result in the same curve or not. By satisfying SESAME (2004) reliability conditions for H/V 

curve, the next stage is to pick the peak of it. It is essential to remember that the most important 

application of the H/V curve is its correct peak identification which corresponds to the shear 

wave resonance frequency for higher velocity contrast between soil and bedrock. Therefore, it is 

of great interest to pick the correct peak of the H/V curve. In most of the cases, when a high-

velocity contrast exists at the subsurface, the picking of the peak frequency is quite easy and 

straightforward. However, sometimes there exists two velocity contrasts or an increasing 

gradient of velocity from the surface to the rock for which the H/V results in two or a broad 

peak, respectively. Therefore, to pick the peak of H/V curve, which should be closer to the shear 

resonance frequency, is quite tricky in both cases. Consequently, some criteria to clarity the peak 

are suggested to ensure the picking of the correct peak (Fig 3.4f, SESAME, 2004). The terms 

appearing in Fig.3.4e-f are given in Table 3.1 with its short definition. With the help of these 

criteria for the curve and peak, the margin of mistake of picking a wrong peak is very little. 

To obtain the H/V curve, the Geopsy free package is a good tool, however the problem with 

Geopsy is that the SESAME (2004) criteria are not implemented there yet. For this purpose, we 



 
 

27 
 

analyzed our recorded noise data with Matlab, where the conditions for the reliability of the 

curve and peak can be easily implemented.

for the H/V analysis; (b) shows the smoothed spectral amplitude of all the three components; (c) the average H/V 

curves of all the 64 windows (upper lower limit indicates the 95% confidence interval around mean H/V curve 

values); (e-f) show the criteria of reliable H/V curve and reliability of clear peak, SESAME 2004.

As we will use the H/V curve, later, in this thesis for the inversion process, some additional 

criteria are implemented along with ones suggested by the SESAME (2004) for more robust H/V 

curve results. Albarello et al., (2011) defined the quality of seismic noise recorded data and the 

H/V curve in terms of three different classes, as: class A, trustworthy and interpretable H/V 

curve, it represents a reference measurement that can be considered by itself for the site of 

concern; class B, ambiguous H/V curve, that should be used with caution and in case of 

coherency with other measurements performed nearby; class C, poor quality H/V curve (hardly 

interpretable), to be discarded. The criteria used to classify measurements of class A are: 

1. The duration of the noise record: the duration of the analyzed record should be more than 15 

minutes (we choose 1 hour in our case, Fig. 3.4 (a)) 

2. The removal of artifact: the manmade disturbances (e.g. electromagnetic noise or peaks of 

industrial origin) could be recognized in the Fourier spectra as monochromatic disturbances such 

as the increase of spectral amplitude of all components; 

3. Stationarity of H/V with time: the data should show a persistent shape for at least 30% of the 

duration of the record, Fig. 3.5.

for all the seismic noise record. 

4. The statistical robustness: SESAME (2004) criteria “for a reliable H/V curve and peak” should 

be fulfilled, Fig. 3.4(e-f). 

A measurement belongs to class B if one or more of the previous conditions are not fulfilled. 

Class B measurements degrade to class C if: a rising drift exists from low to high frequencies 

that indicate a tilting of the instrument. 

A new aspect of the H/V curve method, but not analyzed in detail, is to find the directivity effect 

of the H/V curve. The directivity effect of the H/V is trying to evaluate its links either with the 

subsurface geology or with the arrangement of local seismic noise sources. For this analysis the 

seismic noise recorded at the IAG and IGC sites were analyzed. The horizontal (east-west and 

north-south) components of the seismic noise are rotated, merged and its ratio is found with the 

vertical component. The amplitude of the H/V along with azimuth            is found. The 

H/V amplitude with azimuth             is similar because of the symmetry. The amplitude 

of the H/V between           decreased, which shows the less energetic arrival of seismic 

energy from this azimuth. However, a river and heavy traffic road presence, on both sides of the 

river, in the same azimuth suggest that the arriving seismic energy from this azimuth should be 

higher, which is not the case (Fig.3.6, page 30). To observe the direction of this low-energetic 

seismic noise sources distribution (           we map the locations where the noise recording 

are made along with its surrounding. It is shown in Fig.3.7.

Fig.3. 6 Shows the spectrogram of the three component, both the horizontal components show stationarity at 2 Hz 

for all the seismic noise record. 

 

We found no such clear source of noise generation in this predominant direction as most of 

urbanized part of the city surrounding the recording sites is almost equally (Fig 3.7). We believe 

this directivity is related to some subsurface characteristics rather than the distribution of noise 

sources around the recording sites. This will be investigated, later, in detail, for now, we 

compared the results of the two recording sites which are made in close proximity and tried to 

link the directivity effects for both sites for the whole length of its noise recording (Fig. 3.8 &amp;amp; 

Fig 3.9), which shows a similar trend.

Chapter 4: Array technique of active source 

 

4.1 Introduction 

As discussed, one of the basic target in many earthquakes and civil engineering projects is to find 

the stiffness of the soil layer. Actually, there are two approaches to measuring these properties, 

one in the laboratory and the other in the field. The laboratory approach is to study the soil 

sample effect on different parameters of variation in a controlled environment (Kramer, 1996). 

The in situ (field) measurement has the benefit of studying the soil properties in its natural 

undisturbed state. Another advantage of in situ measurement is that a large area can be covered 

by this analysis. For the stiffness measurement in the field, many methods are employed. Among 

of these methods, the best one is the drilling method (downhole logging). Also, there are some 

methods which are used to estimate the stiffness of the soil regarding to the penetration 

resistance, such as cone penetration test (CPT) and standard penetration test (SPT). These 

methods provide excellent results; however, they are very expensive and time-consuming. The 

solution for this time consuming and cost effectiveness is the surface wave analysis. In the 

surface wave method, the earth is considered as a layered medium for which the shear wave 

velocity profile is obtained as a function of depth. The stiffness of a layer can be found from the 

shear wave velocity of the layer. The stiffness and shear wave velocity are directly related 

(Kramer, 1996). Rayleigh and Love waves are used to obtain the dispersion curve, which later 

are inverted to deduce the shear wave velocity profile of the soil. We will try to focus our 

attention on the surface wave analysis method used for the dispersion curve retrieval from the 

Rayleigh wave, and latter jointly, we will latter invert this phase velocity dispersion curve with 

Rayleigh ellipticity curve. 

Rayleigh waves are dispersive in inelastic, isotropic and vertically heterogeneous material. The 

dispersion curve obtained for the Rayleigh waves provides information regarding the shear wave 

velocity, which in turn, it can be used for the stiffness measurement. Rayleigh wave’s dispersion 

curve is a function of frequency, which means that different frequencies travel with different 

phase velocities. Rayleigh waves phase velocity is a complicated function of the shear wave 

velocity Vs, thickness h, primary wave velocity Vp and density ? of soil layers. There are many 

methods used to retrieve Rayleigh wave’s dispersion curve. Among these, the most popular for 

the active source case are SASW (spectral analysis of surface waves) and MASW (multi-channel 

analysis of surface waves) (Park et al., 1999). The MASW is widely used for the shear wave 

velocity estimation of a site for geophysical and engineering projects (Xia 2014).  Xia et al. 

(2002) showed that the deviation between borehole and MASW result is only 15%. We will 

discuss the MASW method in detail but, before that, let's focus on some related features of 

Rayleigh waves. 

 



 
 

33 
 

Rayleigh waves are made from the interaction of P and Sv waves along the surface of the Earth 

(the interface between two media). The particle motion induced by Rayleigh waves has two 

components, horizontal and vertical. This interaction of vertical and horizontal components 

produce particle motion retrograde (anticlockwise) or prograde (clockwise), depending on the 

theoretical phase shift (?
 

 
) between the two respective components. The particle motion induced 

by Rayleigh waves varies with depth. Being retrograde at the surface and become prograde at 

greater depth. The Rayleigh waves are non-dispersive in homogeneous half space, however, they 

are dispersive in vertically heterogeneous materials (by dispersion it means, waves with different 

wavelengths travel with different velocities). A vibrating seismic source at the surface of a 

homogeneous elastic half-space produced, the energy whose 67% of its fraction is imparted to 

Rayleigh waves, 26% to S-waves and 7% to P-waves (Wood, 1968). When the waves travel 

away from the seismic source as a hemispherical wavefront, it encounters a larger area of 

material, the amplitude of the waves decrease, which is known as geometrical spreading or 

geometrical damping. The amplitude of Rayleigh waves decreases in elastic and homogeneous 

half space as      , where r is the distance from the source. The body waves amplitude decrease 

in respective situation as     along the surface and     in the medium. As Rayleigh decay 

slower in comparison to body waves and 67% of energy is imparted to Rayleigh waves, the wave 

field is dominated by Rayleigh waves at very short distances from the impact source (Richard et 

al., 1970). The Rayleigh waves phase velocity curve (dispersion) are multimodal, which means 

that, each frequency component might have different propagation velocity. The curve with low 

phase velocity for all frequency components is known as the fundamental mode curve, while the 

rest all are termed as higher modes. Higher mode exists above a certain frequency. The two most 

commonly active source surface wave dispersion curve method used will be discussed here; both 

methods have the advantage that they can be easily employable in the urbanized environment.   

4.2 SASW (Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves) 

SASW was introduced in 1980 ((Heisey et al., 1982)) for the surface wave spectral analysis and 

Rayleigh wave dispersion retrieval. For the generation of seismic wave, an impulsive source is 

used, and the propagated waves are recorded with two, or in some cases, 12 geophones. To 

obtain the dispersion curve on the wide frequency range, impulsive sources of different impacts 

(hammer, weight drop) are used at various distances from the first geophone (sensor), with the 

purpose to excite waves of different frequency contents. 

Data recorded by geophones are processed in the frequency domain for Rayleigh wave velocity 

retrieval. The schematic diagram describing the overall procedure of the SASW method is shown 

in Fig.4.1. Two sensors time series, i and k, are taken at a time. The source and first receiver 

distance, xi, are kept equal to the distance between two receivers (xk). Both of the sensors time 

series are transformed into frequency domain to calculate the corresponding spectral density, 

      , which gives the power of the signal as function of frequency.  



 
 

34 
 

. 

Fig.4. 1 The schematic describing the overall procedure of the SASW method. 

To estimate the connection between two-time series as a function of frequency, the cross spectral 

density distribution is found out through Eq.4.1 as 

               
              (4.1) 

where Mik(f) and  ik(f) are the magnitude spectrum and the phase spectrum of the cross spectral 

density, respectively, and i =    . The time taken by the Rayleigh waves to travel between the 

two sensors (geophones) is given by 

       
      

   
         (4.2) 

where        is the time taken through distance xk-xi  by the frequency component (f) of the 

Rayleigh waves. The Rayleigh waves phase velocity and wavelength at frequency (f) can be 

found out through equation 4.3 and 4.4 as 

        
      

      
          (4.3) 

        
      

 
          (4.4) 

This process is repeated with different impact sources and sensors distances       and also for 

different source-receiver distances   . Later, the dispersion curve of the Rayleigh waves is 

obtained. Rayleigh wave phase velocity curve upper and lower bounds are found out using 

standard deviation for each frequency component, which is later used for inversion to retrieve 

shear wave velocity as a function of depth. 

Spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW) are repeated for different receiver of pairs of 

distances in order to manually examine the quality of the result, so it is very time-consuming. 

Another error, which is often made during the SASW analysis, is the misidentification of surface 



 
 

35 
 

wave signal from noise (body wave or higher mode). If a noise (body waves) is taken as surface 

wave signal, it will compromise the quality of dispersion curve and also, the shear wave velocity 

(Park et al., 1999). 

4.3 MASW (Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves) 

Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) was introduced by Park et al (1999). Like 

most of the geophysical methods, the MASW method can be divided into three steps: data 

acquisition, data processing, and inversion analysis. A brief description of each step will be 

given here, followed by the advantages of this method over the other surface wave method. The 

mains procedures of the MASW are given in the schematic diagram shown in Fig.4.2. 

 

 

Fig.4. 2 A overview of the MASW method: (a) Geophones are lined up on the surface of the test site. A wave is 

generated and the wave propagation is recorded; (b) A dispersion image (c) is obtained from the recorded surface 

wave data. The high amplitude bands display the dispersion characteristics and is used to construct the fundamental 

mode dispersion curve (d). A theoretical dispersion curve is obtained based on assumed layer thicknesses and 

material parameters for each layer and compared to the experimental dispersion curve (e). The shear wave velocity 

profile and the layer structure that result in the best fit are taken as the result of the survey (f) (taken from 

Ólafsdóttir, 2016). 

4.3.1 MASW data acquisition procedure 

To acquire the MASW data, a set of 12, 24, 48 or even 96 geophones are usually used (Donohue, 

2013). The geophones are vertically coupled to the ground on a line with equal geophone spacing 



 
 

36 
 

dx. All the geophones are connected to a separate channel and the whole system is analysed by a 

field computer, which has a data recording quality control software. Seismic waves are generated 

by an impact source at one end of the geophones array. The recorded data consist of time or 

time-offset histories in discrete form. The data (wave field) recorded is expressed as u(x,t), 

where x is the distance from the source to a geophone and t is the time.  The record u(x,t) is 

digitized at a sampling interval dt, corresponding to sampling frequency   , which is the number 

of data points recorded in unit time. The usual sampling interval used for active MASW is 1 ms, 

which corresponds to a sampling frequency of 1000 Hertz. The sampling frequency in terms of 

angular frequency is defined as        . The record length of one second is enough for 

MASW impact source (Park 2015). In case of using a vibrating seismic source (vibrator) a longer 

recording time (2 s) is required (Park 1999). 

The maximum depth (    ) to which the MASW survey gives a reliable measure of shear wave 

depends on the characteristics of the site, sensors threshold frequency    and impact source type. 

A general rule of thumb for the depth of investigation is related with longest wavelength 

recorded during acquisition (Park &amp;amp; Carnevale, 2010). 

                              (4.5) 

The effects of the sensors used during the acquisition are not thoroughly investigated yet. Park 

and Miller (2002) pointed out that geophone sensors with threshold frequency     10 and 40 Hz 

can be used to record the surface wave field up to 5 and 10 Hz. Xia (2009) noted that to retrieved 

shear wave velocity up to 30-50 m  depth, the geophones with    4.5 Hz are good choices. 

Another important aspect of data acquisition is the choice of the source to generate seismic 

waves. The most commonly used impact source for seismic wave generation is sledgehammer of 

5 to 10 kg (Park, 2007). Another important seismic generating source for MASW is weight drop 

in which a heavy weight is drop from a crane. The source which can produce high impact on 

ground is capable of producing surface wave of low frequency (long-wavelength) and hence 

facilitate a deeper investigation. The use of a base plate (metallic or firm rubber) for hammer 

impact point helps in generating low frequency surface waves (Park, 2015). To overview the 

MASW setup parameter for the data acquisition a literature review was done. Here, the main 

practicing parameters of data recording such as profile length, receiver spacing and source offset 

were listed.   

4.3.2 Length of the geophones spread 

The spread of geophones (L) for data acquisition is connected with the maximum wavelength 

(    ) recorded during acquisition, which corresponds to the maximum investigation depth 

(    ). The general rule of thumb is the maximum wavelength is equal to the spread array (Park 

and Carnevale, 2010) 

                (4.6) 



 
 

37 
 

The study of Park &amp;amp; Carnevale (2010) has shown that an error of 5% might occur if trying to 

analyse higher wavelength than the receiver spread          . For practice, Park (2015) 

suggested that the spread of the geophones should lies with               , and Xia 

(2009) recommend a spread of        . The seismic waves generated for the data acquisition 

in MASW by impact survey sources will attenuate below the detectable signal level until to the 

end of the large spread  geophones, that's the reason why very long receiver spreads are avoided 

during the acquisition 

4.3.3 Receiver spacing and source offset 

The space between two receivers (dx) is associated with minimum wavelength (      which can 

be included in the Rayleigh wave phase velocity curve (dispersion curve). Xia (2009) pointed out 

that to avoid spatial aliasing the minimum wavelength should not be larger than    
 

 
 

   
. 

Another important aspect about the receiver spacing is regarding to the thickness of the topmost 

layer. Receiver spacing acts as a control parameter for the minimum thickness of layer which can 

be retrieved during the inversion:           , where     is the thickness of top soil layer 

(Park et al., 1999; Xia et al., 2009). 

There are two important features which are directly associated with source offset, near-field 

effect and far-field effect. The near field-effect situation occurs when the offset of the source (x) 

is not large enough to produce planar surface waves. To avoid the near-field effect, the source 

offset (x) should be in accordance with the maximum wavelength expected to be recorded in the 

acquisition. Generally, planar surface wave arrival occurs at the nearest receiver when the source 

offset is greater than half of the maximum wavelength      (i.e,        where x is the source 

offset). Far-field effect is the situation when attenuation of high-frequency components of waves 

travelling along the free surface causes body waves to dominate the wave field (Park and 

Shawver, 2009). The minimum (xmin) and maximum (xmax) source offsets for use in practice have 

been suggested (Park,2015) 

                              (4.7) 

 

The measurement profile setup parameters discussed in preceding sections are summarized in 

Table 4.1. The length of the receiver spread (L) and the length of the source offset (x) are given 

within a range, as indicated Table 4.1. The receiver spacing (dx) is calculated by assuming that 

N=24 receivers are used for data acquisition. The possible effects of surface wave attenuation, 

i.e., due to the length of the receiver spread or the length of the source offset, are not specifically 

considered in the Table 4.1.

various depth can be found on www.masw.com). 

4.3.4 The effect of topography on MASW acquisition 

 

The natural layout of the Earth’s surface is termed as topography. Topography has an effect on 

the quality of the acquired surface wave data and therefore, on the quality of retrieved dispersion 

curve. The terrain on which the acquisition are made should be flat for the optimum results; 

within the receiver spread, the surface relief should be less than 0.1L (Park, 2015, Fig.4.3a,b). 

Zeng et al. (2012) pointed out that the slope of the surface along the receivers spread should be 

less than 10
0
. A steeper slope (   0º; Fig.4.3d) leads to a significant error, compromising the 

quality of retrieved dispersion curve.  

 

 

Fig.4. 3 Shows a sketch of receiver profile for acquisition (taken from www.masw.com) 

  

4.4 Dispersion analysis of the acquired data 

 

One of the most crucial steps of the MASW analysis is the retrieval of correct dispersion curve 

(Park et al., 1998). There are several methods employed for this task (McMechan &amp;amp; Yedlin, 

1981; Park et al., 1998, 1999). Here in this section, we discuss the two most commonly used 

techniques for the dispersion curve retrieval (swept-frequency and phase shift method; Park et 

al., 1998, 1999). 



 
 

39 
 

4.4.1 Swept-frequency technique 

Swept-frequency technique was first described by Park et al. (1999). It is used to extract the 

fundamental mode dispersion curve from the MASW recorded. The procedure of the method is 

to determine, trace to trace, the time arrival and amplitude coherence of the surface waves 

recorded.  

In such procedure, the Rayleigh waves phase velocity of different frequencies is obtained by the 

slope of each frequency (Park et al, 1999). A little processing effort is required in swept 

frequency record to retrieve a dispersion curve from an active source recording (shot gather). 

The coherence of surface wave motion is used as a tool to neglect the noise source in the data, 

such as body waves and higher Rayleigh in arrival mode, causing a break in the coherence. 

The procedure of swept frequency can be outlined in two-step, like as getting swept frequency 

record and determining the phase velocity curve from coherency of each frequency component 

of the record. 

 

Fig.4. 4 Show the sketch of swept frequency procedure (modified from Ólafsdóttir ,2016). 

 

The sketch of Fig.4.4 can be explained in the follow steps: 

1. For n receivers, the indirect recording (impulsive source) and for direct source recording (a 

vibrating seismic source) a swept frequency record is obtained by transforming  by convolution 

the swept-frequency with a stretch function .The indirect impulsive record are transformed to 

swept-frequency by the convolution of a stretch function s(t) with the record        as  



 
 

40 
 

                             (4.8) 

This process in Eq.4.8 is performed from trace to trace for total record of n traces such as  

                                (4.9) 

where           is swept-frequency for j-th trace;         is the impulsive record for j-th trace; 

     stretch function (Eq.4.10 and Fig.4.5) is a function (sinusoidal) of changing frequency 

(        ) with time (T). Here            are the lowest and highest frequencies to be processed 

while T is the total length of the     . 

               
         

 

 
       (4.10) 

 

Fig.4. 5 Shows the swept frequency record for a trace of impulsive source  (from a short gather)  by convolution 

with stretch function s(t) of changing frequency  (f_1=5 Hz? ,f?_2=30 Hz) (Ólafsdóttir ,2016). 

 

2. In the next step, after swept frequency record is obtained, the determination of trace to trace 

time arrival and amplitude coherency of the recorded surface waves are analysed on the swept-

frequency recorded (Fig.4.6). 

  



 
 

41 
 

 

Fig.4. 6 Swept-frequency record obtained from an impulsive shot gather. Red markers identify the local maxima of 

each trace that are parts of linear events that are considered reliable for further analysis. Local maxima that are not 

used for analysis are shown with blue markers (taken from Ólafsdóttir, 2016). 

 

3. Each linear event corresponds to a specific frequency. The frequency corresponding to each 

linear event is determined. The frequency corresponding to linear event l (fl) is assumed to be the 

average frequency within the event. 

4. The linear slope of each linear event is determined by using the method of least squares. 

5. The Rayleigh wave velocity at the frequency representative of each linear event is determined. 

The Rayleigh wave velocity is taken dividing the slope of the least squares regression line. The 

process is repeated for the whole record and dispersion curve, and a function of frequency is 

obtained at the end. 

 

Fig.4. 7 Linear events extracted from a swept-frequency record. Red markers identify the local maxima of each trace 

that are used for identification of linear events. Two linear events corresponding to frequencies (f) of 11.3 Hz and 

18.8 Hz are indicated by black Lines (Ólafsdóttir, 2016). 



 
 

42 
 

 

4.4.2 Phase-shift method 

 

This procedure is actually a wave field transformation method termed as phase-shift technique. 

For a shot gather of an impulsive source record of MASW, the dispersion curve is obtained by 

dispersion image (phase-velocity spectra) (Park et al., 1998). Utilizing the phase shift technique, 

different mode of Rayleigh waves dispersion can be perceived from the frequency content and 

phase velocity at each frequency. The body wave and other scatter energy (reflected-refracted), 

which are considered as a noise, can be easily recognized by its frequency content and move-out. 

The dispersion curve of Rayleigh waves is extracted from the dispersion image (Park et al., 

1998; Xia et al., 2003). The phase shift retrieval of dispersion curve processing is a tri-stage 

procedure, which is comprised of: Fourier transformation of the data, dispersion imaging, and 

retrieval of dispersion curve. A sketch like of the swept frequency method for the processing 

steps is shown in Fig.4.8. 

 

 

 

Fig.4. 8 A sketch of phase-shift (Ólafsdóttir ,2016) 

The phase shift method outlined in Fig 4.8 can be detailed in steps as follows. 

 



 
 

43 
 

1. The acquired data is in time-space       . It is transformed into Fourier domain along the 

time axis       . As the acquired data is discrete both in time and in space, the Fourier 

transform is achieved for each trace, separately, along the time axis as discrete Fourier 

transformation (DFT). 

                     
 

  
       (4.11) 

       is represented as function of amplitude and phase                 as follow 

                            (4.12) 

where 

                         (4.13) 

The dispersion related properties are sealed in the phase spectrum       , while the amplitude 

spectrum carries the information regarding the attenuation and spherical divergence (Park et al., 

1999). The term      is defined as  

     
 

     
         (4.14) 

and the term       is determined at each frequency as  

      
             

     
                     (4.15) 

where    is the distance from the source to the first receiver and dx is the spacing between 

geophones.  

2. As dispersion related properties are embedded in phase spectrum, amplitude spectrum in the 

frequency domain is normalized by dividing its absolute value without losing any information. 

           
     

       
         (4.14) 

where            is the normalized amplitude of the jth trace . 

3. A phase velocity range is selected for analysis, such as,                      (for 

example, 10m/s to 2000 m/s). 

4. For a given frequency and phase velocity, the time delay to balance the specific offset is found 

out in term of phase-shift. 

5. The phase-shift calculated is applied to all separate traces of shot gather and later added to 

obtain the summed amplitude against each set of           . Both of these steps (4 and 5) are 

repeated for different frequencies with a small incremental increase in test phase velocity 

(VR,T). 



 
 

44 
 

6. The Rayleigh wave phase velocity dispersion curve is obtained from the plot of summed 

amplitude of the slant-trace in frequency-phase velocity domain. The peak amplitude of the 

summed slant-trace displays the dispersion properties in term of color coding with normalized 

amplitude. 

 

Fig.4. 9 Shows the basic principle behind the phase-shift method: (a) Normalized sinusoid curves with the frequency 

of 20 Hz and phase velocity of 140 m/s; (b) Normalized summed amplitude as a function of frequency for a different 

number of traces (www.masw.com) 

 

Fig.4. 10 Show the frequency-phase velocity plot as function summed amplitude (dispersion image for BEB4a, 

Bebedouro area). 

4.6 Advantage of MASW method 

 

The MASW method overcame the limitations of the SASW method initially introduced. SASW 

method data acquisition requires more effort when compared to MASW data acquisition, for 



 
 

45 
 

example, to cover a wide frequency range for dispersion analysis, SASW acquisition is repeated 

with different impact points and with diverse source-receivers intervals along with different 

sensors intervals. A single MASW measurement is sufficient for all this analysis which is done 

by multiple recording with different sources, variable source receiver intervals and different 

receivers spacing for SASW (Park et al, 1999). As the final goal of almost all surface wave based 

methods is to obtain the dispersion curve, the method which achieves it with less physical and 

computational effort will be considered better than the others. The dispersion curve retrieval in 

MASW cases is faster and can be effortlessly automated. The noise reduction (body or 

reflected/scattered waves) can be handled easily in MASW, when compared to SASW (Park et 

al., 1999). The investigation's depth of each technique is another way to eligible a better job over  

the other. For a given impact load, the investigation depth provided by MASW (generally 30-50 

m) is greater than (Park et al., 2007) the achieved by SASW (20 m) (Bessason &amp;amp; Erlingsson, 

2011). MASW method is handier in identifying the multimodal dispersion than the SASW (Xia 

&amp;amp; Miller, 2003). The last advantage to mention which interest in this study is also the possibility 

of measuring the dispersion curve analysis of passive surface wave generated by environmental 

and cultural noise. The lower frequency characteristics of passive surface wave helps to obtain 

dispersion curve for higher wavelengths which in turn it provides deeper investigation. 

 

4.7  Inversion of dispersion curve 

 

After obtaining the Rayleigh wave dispersion curve, the next step is to obtain the shear wave 

velocity profile by the inversion analysis of the retrieved experimental curve. The inversion 

process is based on Rayleigh waves propagation in a layered Earth model. The inversion process 

of surface wave is a non-linear operation. Several mathematical frameworks are used to estimate 

the fundamental and higher mode dispersion curve for the Rayleigh wave from an initial set of 

parameters. The initial set of these parameters is either assumed in priority or chosen randomly 

from the parameter space. These initial parameters are altered during the inversion process and 

for each change, the corresponding theoretical dispersion curve of the model is compared with 

the experimental curve. The inversion of surface wave is a multi-parameter optimization process. 

The general outline of an inversion process is usually divided into three steps: a computational 

algorithm computing the initial set of parameters; a mathematical procedure to estimate the 

theoretical dispersion curve for a computed set of parameters with assumption of layered Earth 

model; and a computation procedure to minimize the misfit, which is the deviation between 

theoretically estimated and experimental dispersion curves. The inversion algorithm and the 

procedure adopted for inversion of this work will be discussed in Chapter 5, the mathematical 

procedure will be given in chapter 6, as well as, the misfit function of the deviation between 

targets curves and the modelled curve.

4.8 MASW data acquisition for the study 

 

Three locations were chosen for the experimental analysis for the application of the learned 

lessons from the theoretical analysis of the study (give in detail in Chapter 10). The first one are 

the borehole test sites in front of the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric 

Sciences, IAG, and Institute of Geosciences, IGC, both at the campus of University of São Paulo. 

The second is the Colônia site. Colônia, near to São Paulo city, is a circular structure, nearly 

swampy, is believed to be a crater site from the impact of a meteorite. The third site is 

Bebedouro area, São Paulo state, which remains under research due to the induced earthquake, 

reported in the area. The parameters of data acquisition of MASW profiles will be given in 

Tables for each site. The details of these sites will come in its respective sections. Here we list 

the parameters which were used during the MASW data acquisition.

The sites were chosen keeping in mind some distinct properties of the other sites. The USP site 

(in front of the IAG - Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciências Atmosféricas, cited here 

frequently as IAG-front) has the advantage of the borehole data availability for the calibration 

and the quality check of the result, the Colônia site was chosen due to its geological significance, 

its bowl shape structure is almost swampy and most of the conventional geophysical methods are 

difficult to employ there because of the surface water and mud (there are some small patches of 

dry land which make it possible to install a seismometer for noise recording and hence, the H/V 

analysis) , the Bebedouro area was chosen because of the availability of seismic noise data 

recording, as well as, the data about the multiple water wells subsurface interfaces, from which 

the information about the subsurface interfaces are accessible and it was easy to test thickness 

frequency relation over this site. Among all these three sites, the two IAG-IGC and Colônia has a 

strong bedrock laying below the unconsolidated soft sediments, being also true for the 

Bebedouro area, however, this area surface sediments are stronger when compared to the pre-

mentioned sites. The detailed geological description of these sites are beyond the scope, 

however, a concise introduction will be presented for each of the sites prior to its inversion in the 

coming chapters.

Chapter 5: General inversion strategies for the surface waves analysis 

 

5.1 The forward and inversion problem 

 

Understanding the data is one of the basic starting steps in all the inverse problem cases. Data is 

simply the list of some numerical values, which is most conveniently represented as a vector. If 

N is the number (measurement) which an experiment is repeated, each result is an addition to 

data as element of data vector. After N performances, the data will have N elements. Noteworthy 

is that observations from an experiment (data) are not knowledge, the knowledge is gained from 

the analysis of data in general and inverse theory in particular. The knowledge can be obtained in 

many forms. Our knowledge will take the form of numerical value (s-wave velocity model). 

The link between data and model can be defined in one line such that: data = what we have 

measured; model parameters = numbers that constitute knowledge; something distilled from the 

theory data or physical law is the link between the two, data and model parameter. To understand 

it, let's consider an example: if we want to find the density of rock from its mass and volume, the 

mass and volume measured are the data, having two elements {d1= mass and d2=volume} , with 

N=2 (d1,d2) and the unknown model parameter is one as M=1 (density as m1). In this study, The 

physical law which link data and model would be the statement that the density multiplied by 

volume is equal to the mass and can be written in compact form by the vector equation as 

d2m1=d1 (Menke 1989). There are two types of problem, one is known as forward problem 

(Fig.5.1), while the other is known as inverse problem, which are defined below. 

 

Fig.5.11 Shows the illustration of inversion and forward problems (from Scales &amp;amp; Snieder, 2000). 

Forward problem is known as numerical models obtained on the basis of computation of 

theoretical values corresponding to experimental data measurement, d.  

The inverse problem is where the information concerning of the physical properties of the model 

and the values to be assigned to the parameters have to be inferred from the data (Fig.5.1). 

                  (5.1)

In Eq.5.1, where     , or Gm in matrix notation, is a function that maps the model    on the 

datum    (Snieder, 1998),         and     are in matrix form d = [d1, d2, … dN]

… mM]
T
and G=[N M]. G is termed as  data kernel matrix, d is known and it is the column vector 

of the N data points. It is possible to solve this matrix equation to find the M model parameters 

of the vector m. In a another way, looking at Eq.5.1, if m is known and utilize data kernel matrix 

to estimates d, it is a forward problem and if d is known, and use inverse of data kernel matrix to 

find the model parameters m, is considered inverse problem. The linearity degree of       , is 

one of the most important aspect of an inverse problem. The geophysical observation d = [d1, d2, 

… dN]

T
 relationship will be either linear (e.g., f(x) = a 

+ bx) or nonlinear             . As function of linearity, it will be more or less complex 

within the optimization procedure.  

To summarize the inversion problem in geophysical perspective in one sentence might be said 

that “To make suggestions about the Earth model parameters from geophysical observations”. In 

the case of dispersion and ellipticity curves, the forward problem can be estimate the (dispersion 

and ellipticity) curves, while on the contrary, inversion problem estimates the medium properties 

(S-wave profile) from the experimentally obtained dispersion and ellipticity curves. 

5.2 Global and local minimal solution of an inverse problem 

One of the easiest and simplest approaches is to solve an inverse problem by data fitting, which 

involves minimizing the misfit       (also termed as the objective function, or squared error) 

among the set of estimated  Gi( )  and observed data (di). This approach is a function of joint 

estimated model m through un-weighted least-squares misfit. 

                  
 

         (5.2) 

In case of linear forward problem the squared error       are estimated via Eq.5.2 to fit the data. 

The       dependence on the parameter has a parabolic shape containing a single minimum 

(unimodal). Any method employed to find out this minimum will be able to find it, which will 

correspond to the best model and will explain the data more closely than all other models (Press 

et al., 1992). However, most of the inversion problems in seismology are nonlinear. In such case 

      dependency on the parameter contain many peaks and it is termed as multimodal (Fig 5.2 

b). Between these minima’s there is one absolute minimum peak known as global minimum, 

which is linked to the best model to explain the data. The other minima's, apart from the global 

one, are known as local minima’s and somehow, are linked to the best models. 



 
 

50 
 

 

Fig.5.12 Shows the least-squares misfit function for a linear problem. (b) The conventional view of the misfit 

function for a nonlinear inverse problem (Menke, 2012). 

There are two more commonly mistakes made during the inversion process; one is the 

consideration of local minima as a global one. In such situation, the data fit are not able to give 

the best data fit (Snieder, 1998). The second problem usually faced is the solution may not lie 

within the physical limits, although the data fit might be better. To handle such situation, the 

misfit function is made clearer to include extra conditions (limits) converging to the acceptable 

physical limits. 

To find the minimum of the misfit function of an inverse problem is considered more an art than 

science, apart from all the mathematical development made in this regard (Snieder, 1998). This 

art foundation is based on the generalized inverse theory presented by Backus and Gilbert in the 

mid-sixties (e.g. Backus and Gilbert, 1967, 1968, 1970). They tried to retrieve the ground 

structure by data analysis strategies. This initial work opens up a new corridor which has been 

heavily studied since then, and several inversion strategies have been developed. The study of 

the performances of these developed inversion strategies are done by the analysis of exploration 

and exploitation criteria (Sambridge &amp;amp; Mosegaard, 2002). Exploration means the reducing of 

misfit function by a randomly trial basis on different region of parameter space, irrespective of 

what is already known from the previous samples. The exploitation criteria are the other way 

around, which where it is choosen the next sample by using the knowledge of previous samples, 

or the only best current fit sample. Keeping these two criteria as basis for the analysis, 

Sambridge &amp;amp; Mosegaard (2002) found out that in case of adopting an explorative strategy for the 

inversion like Tabu search, Uniform search, Importance sampling, Genetic Algorithms, 

Simulated annealing, Evolutionary programming and  Neighbourhood algorithm are unlikely to 

trap in local minima, however, these are slower at convergence. In the case of using an 

exploitative strategy for inversion (e.g., Newton-Raphson, Steepest descent, and Amoeba 

search), they are very fast in converging to a specific area of parameter space but are more prone 



 
 

51 
 

to trap in local minima and inferred ground structure are more likely depended on the initial 

model considered for inversion. 

 

Fig.5.13 A schematic representation of various search/optimization algorithms in terms of exploration and 

exploitation of the information. Shaded borders indicate a deterministic (not–Monte Carlo) method (Sambridge and 

Mosegaard, 2002). 

To draw a conclusion from the previous discussion, it can be said that an inversion strategy can 

be adopted depending on the basis of the goal of the study (quick convergence or global 

solution). As for our case, we will adopt an inversion strategy for the surface wave (dispersion 

and ellipticity). A combination of exploration and exploitation may be more suitable as surface 

wave inversion problems are highly non-linear and have many minima's in the misfit function, 

where each minimum fit the data with the same misfit. 

5.2. Surface wave curves inversion strategies 

Surface waves, especially Rayleigh waves analysis, are most commonly employed for the job of 

inferring the subsurface structure for engineering application. Rayleigh wave curves (dispersion 

and ellipticity) are greatly nonlinear function of S-waves velocity (Vs), thickness (h), P-waves 

velocity (Vp) and density (?), respectively. The inversion problem is termed as multimodal 

because of the existence of a large number of local minima's in the respective parameter space 

(Yamanaka and Ishida, 1996). Two main methodologies are applied to handle the non-linearity 

of surface wave inversion case. The first one is the nonlinear objective function (e.g. f(x) =

). This function is mathematically linearized by changing an appropriate variable (e.g h(x) 

= ln [f(x)] = -ax+b) or first order Taylor expansion, and later, any linear inversion technique is 

applied for optimization procedure. In the second procedure no mathematical linearization is 



 
 

52 
 

performed to the solution of the inverse problem. It is find out with some deterministic or 

probabilistic approach. The following section will briefly outline the two strategies. 

5.2.1 Iterative method (Linearized inversion) 

The main theme of this class of inversion scheme is the fast convergence of the minimum of the 

misfit function by an iterative method through a gradual changing made on the properties of 

current model chosen prior to the inversion. The inversion strategies that fall in this category are 

damped least-square, steepest descendent, conjugate gradients and Newton-Raphson (Press et al., 

1992). In the case of adopting all of these mentioned methods, it is possible to observe the 

convergence toward the solution by partial derivatives or Jacobian matrix. Jacobian matrix is a 

partial derivative matrix that contains the partial derivative of theoretical data of estimated model 

with respect to the model parameter. The partial derivatives computation allows the linearization 

of the non-linear inverse problem. The process is repeated many times (iteration) to converge to 

the minimum of misfit function. Another iterative method employed for the linearized inversion 

is the downhill simplex (Press et al. 1992). The downhill simplex requires function evaluations 

instead of derivatives, unlike Damped least-square, steepest descendent, conjugate gradients or 

Newton-Raphson. 

This linearization class of inversion is used for the situation when the dimension of the space 

parameter is higher. This method converges quickly to the solution of the problem. As described 

above, in situation of high non-linearity of the problem, when there are many minima's in the 

misfit function, all these methods are prone to converge to one of the misfit minima regardless of 

the global minimum. The final obtained model will be highly dependent on the initial model. The 

non-unique solution of the surface wave inversion is very common (Sambridge, 2001). All these 

linearization strategies require a good initial model to start the inversion. The final model may 

lead to a starting model after a large number of iteration.  



 
 

53 
 

Making a conclusion about the linearized inversion strategies, these methods will give the best 

results in the case on the feebly non-linear problem. The methods shown can only be applied to a 

highly non-linear problem in a situation of sufficient previous information about the ground 

structure. However, in a surface wave inversion scenario, where the shear wave velocities are 

linked to surface wave velocities in a complicated way (highly non-linearity and multimodal 

misfit), mostly of the methods failed to find a global solution. The interested reader of the 

linearized inversion strategies is referred to Dorman and Ewing (1962), Herrmann (1994), Lai 

(1998) and Xia et al. (1999). Among the various procedures recommended for the inversion 

under linearized strategy, Singular Value Decomposition - SVD (Golub &amp;amp; Reinsch, 1970) is the 

most widely used. SVD is the best choice for producing a solution in the case of ill-condition 

matrices. 

5.2.2 Monte Carlo inversion strategies 

The main idea of these methods is originated from the experimental branch of mathematics 

which used random numbers to find a solution to a deterministic or probabilistic problem. The 

search of parameters space (predefined parameters upper and lower bounds) was initially 

achieved by uniform sampling for an optimal solution of an inverse problem under these 

inversion strategies. The parameter space search  is done by the uniform sampling of the 

parameter space without taking any initial model to start the process. All these Monte Carlo 

methods, unlike linearized inversion strategies (which necessitate partial derivatives and matrix 

inversion which might cause numerical instabilities), require only forward model and misfit 

computation, that's why Monte Carlo inversion strategies are considered potentially stable 

techniques. The advantages of the Monte Carlo inversion strategies are: i) though the process is 

slow it still ensures the convergence to an optimal solution without any possibility to trap in local 

minima; (ii) it explores the whole parameter space, therefore, a best-fitted model of the data and 

the trade-off between various parameter can be evaluated (Sambridge &amp;amp; Mosegaard, 2002); (iii) 

it statistically treats the result of the inverse problem, which helps in cases of high non-linearity. 

The uniform sampling of the parameter space in case of a high dimensionality of parameter 

space makes it computationally ineffective. Because of this disadvantage of the uniform Monte 

Carlo inversion approach, different refined strategies were presented with pseudo-random 

sampling of parameter space (Simulated Annealing by Kirkpatrick et al., 1983; Neighborhood 

Algorithm by Sambridge, 1999, Yamanaka &amp;amp; Ishida, 1996). Below, we will briefly discuss 

Genetic algorithm and simulated annealing and then will discuss with details the Neighborhood 

Algorithm which is used for the inversion analysis in this thesis (Geopsy tool packages; 

http://www.geopsy.org/). 

5.2.2.1 Simulated Annealing 

 

This class of Monte Carlo inversion strategy method exploits a statistical mechanical analogy to 

search for the global minimum of a misfit function containing a large number of local minima's 

(Sambridge &amp;amp; Mosegaard, 2002). The fundamental thought is to simulate the physical 



 
 

54 
 

methodology of chemical annealing in which a liquefied crystalline material is cooled gradually 

towards the point of solidification and, consequently, a stable high ordered (low-energy) design. 

In similarity to this physical-chemical process, in the inversion plan, the objective function is 

related to the energy of the crystalline material, while suitable numerical standards are settled, 

simulating a "cooling" of the framework to be optimized (Sambridge &amp;amp; Mosegaard, 2002). 

When an appropriate cooling rate is used, the process is able to find, at least, the location of the 

parameter space near the global minimum, as well as, slow cooling results in low-energy crystal 

configurations. 

5.2.2.2 Genetic Algorithm 

 

The evolution of biological life is considered as a core theme for this kind of inversion strategy. 

The evolution is considered as an optimization process. A natural system like fauna adapts to its 

surrounding environment to survive. The genetic algorithm at first was developed by Holland 

(1975), which was later popularized by Wilson &amp;amp; Vasudevan, (1991), Gallagher et al. (1994), 

Stoffa &amp;amp; Sen (1991) and Sen &amp;amp; Stoffa (1992) for the different geophysical problems. There are 

many variants of genetic algorithm, however, the basic strategy is to compel a total population of 

models towards better data to fit at the same time. The genetic algorithm works on the sets of the 

parameters with stress placed on the particular parameter, however, the simulated annealing 

algorithm emphasises on a set of parameter which is continually updated. The iteration of the 

basic method involves three stages usually called selection, crossover and mutation. Each step of 

iteration in the genetic algorithm is controlled by a tuning parameter chosen by the user. In each 

iteration, all these three steps aim to generate a new offspring model population which, in a way, 

have survived (the models with lower misfit) among the previous models population. At each 

iteration, the misfit function is evaluated for all models previously generated. The criteria are set 

to select only those models which fulfil certain criteria (Survival of the fittest). This converge a 

new model generation toward a lower misfit region of the parameter space. The mechanisms 

used to implement selection, crossover, and mutation of the model population can be crucially 

important to the effectiveness of the algorithm. For a detail discussion the interested readers are 

referred to (Goldberg, 1989; Wilson &amp;amp; Vasudevan, 1991). 

5.2.2.3 Neighborhood algorithm 

 

As discussed above, both of the Monte Carlo approaches which utilize uniform pseudorandom 

sampling of the parameter space become impractical in the case of the high dimensionality of the 

problem due to its heavy computation. The solution to minimized this heavy computation was 

offered by Sambridge (1999) when seeking an answer to the question that "By what means can a 

search for new models be best guided by all the past models for which the forward problem has 

been solved (and hence the data misfit value are evaluated)?”. Both genetic and simulated 

annealing methods utilize the information from the previous sample generated but in a complex 

way. The information deduced from previous samples may also be highly dependent on control 



 
 

55 
 

parameters (GA) or temperature profiles (SA), each of which must be tuned for each problem 

individually (Sambridge, 1999). On the other hand, neighborhood algorithm operated by four 

parameters is a self-adaptive search of parameter space. The parameter space of the inverse 

strategy is decomposed into cells based on the approximation of the misfit. These cells are 

known as Voronoi cell (Voronoi, 1908; Fig.5.4). The Voronoi cell for any distribution of points 

in any number of dimensions of parameter space is the region about a point, which is nearer to 

point under consideration than all other points of the distribution. The region of Voronoi cell 

around a point is defined by an appropriate norm distance (typically Euclidean). For Euclidean 

distance in 2D, they are polygons whose edges are perpendicular bisectors between pairs of 

points. In 3D they are convex polyhedra, in higher dimensions they are convex polytopes 

(Sambridge, 1998). This division of parameter space into Voronoi cells of neighborhoods region 

around a generated points (models) has a powerful property, which is,  how irregular the initial 

points (models) distribution are  and how high the dimensions of the parameter space is. It 

always converges to the part of the parameter space having the optimal solution. 

 

Fig.5.14 Shows the example of Voronoi cells drawn around the points (model) of parameter space for a simple 2-D 

problem. (a–c) Voronoi cells of about 10, 100, and 1000 generated model, respectively. Figure 5.4d shows the true 

fitness surface. As the algorithm proceeds, each Voronoi diagram is used to guide the sampling. Note how the 

Voronoi cells are more concentrated in the darker regions where the fit is high. (Sambridge &amp;amp; Mosegaard, 2002). 



 
 

56 
 

 

The neighborhood algorithm has two important aspects which guides the new generation of 

samples within the parameter space to the promising region of a lower misfit. The first one is the 

shape and size of the Voronoi cell, which it is not handled externally but operated and guided 

automatically by the previous sampling. Note that the boundaries of each Voronoi cell are 

determined by all previous samples, and regardless of how irregularly distributed the samples 

are, the Voronoi cell will be a ‘reasonable’ one, in the sense of an L-norm (Sambridge, 1999).  

At each iteration step, the newly generated samples are concentrated in the neighborhoods 

surrounding the better data-fitting models. In this way, the algorithm exploits the information 

contained in the previous models to adapt the sampling. The second is the arrangement of the 

models generated to fit the data on the basis of misfit rank, which helps in identifying good 

models based on the data fit. All the generated models are rank on the basis of theirs misfit, 

which help in search the most promising area of the parameter space. 

5.3 Brief inversion procedure of neighbourhood algorithm 

 

The Neighborhood Algorithm - NA (Sambridge, 1999) is a standout amongst the latest MC 

direct search method for nonlinear inversion. The key idea of the NA is to make use of a simple 

geometrical concept to search the parameter space. In fact, new samples of parameter values are 

generated by randomly re-sampling within specific Voronoi cells with a locally uniform density. 

The power of this approach consists of the fact that at each iteration, the sampling is influenced 

by the size and distribution of the Voronoi cells, which are automatically controlled by all the 

previous samples (Sambridge, 2001). Thanks to the interesting properties of the Voronoi 

geometry, it seems that NA is able to sample the most promising regions of the solution space 

simultaneously (Whatelet, 2005). Therefore, at each iteration, the new samples tend to be 

concentrated in the neighborhood surrounding of the models better fitting the data. 

The Voronoi decomposition of the parameter space is the base of an approximation of the misfit 

function which is progressively refined during the inversion process. The approximation is set as 

constant inside each cell and the misfit value calculated at the central point is affected to the 

whole cell. A two-dimensional parameter space is given as an example in Fig. 5.5. The black 

dots are some model points for which a misfit is calculated. 

The neighbourhood algorithm needs four tuning parameters: 

is the number of iteration to perform; 

is the number of models chosen at random inside the parameter space at the beginning of the 

inversion; 

is the number of models generated at each iteration; 



 
 

57 
 

is the number of best cells (with the lowest misfit) where the ns models are generated. 

The inversion process is composed of the following phases (described by Sambridge (1999a) and 

Wathelet, 2005, 2008): 

1. A set of  models is randomly generated with a uniform probability in the parameter space; 

2. The misfit function is calculated for the most recently generated model; 

3. The nr models, with the lowest misfit of all models generated so far, are selected; 

4. Generate an average of    new samples with a uniform probability in each selected cell;  

5. Add to the new samples to the previous ensemble of models and go back to 2. 

Fig.5.15 Shows Voronoi cells for a two-dimensional parameter space (from Sambridge, 1999a). (a) is an example of 

a two-dimensional parameter showing the models (black dots) and the limits of the Voronoi cells. (b) depicts the 

Voronoi geometry after the first iteration (from Wathelet, 2005) 

In Fig 5.5 (a)     =9 (in this case) models are generated and the grey cell has the lowest misfit. 

In this example, seven new models are generated in one cell (   = 1, and    = 7). The size of the 

original cell decreases as the sampling rate increases. If the cell with the grey outline has the 

lowest misfit, the density of sampling will not decrease systematically after each iteration. This is 

an interesting property of the Voronoi geometry that allows the centre of sampling to jump from 

place to place, whilst always sampling the most promising nr regions simultaneously. 

 

In the neighborhood algorithm, a random walk (Gibbs sampler) is performed with a uniform 

probability density function inside the cell and zero outside. A walk is a sequence of 

perturbations of a model along with all the axis. The modified model is statistically independent 

of the original model. Asymptotically, the samples produced by this walk will be uniformly 



 
 

58 
 

distributed inside the cell regardless of its shape. To continue the random walk inside a particular 

cell, it is mandatory to calculate the multi-dimensional limits of the cell. Calculating the 

complete Voronoi geometry for high dimensional spaces becomes practically impossible when 

the number of models increases. Sambridge (1999) proposed an original algorithm to compute 

only the limits along lines, which are parallel to the axis, in a precise and efficient way. These 

lines support the successive segments of the random walks. 

The exploration and exploitation are nicely handled by the neighborhood algorithm. The 

algorithm is more exploratory if the    new samples are distributed on many cells and it 

optimizes more quickly if they are restricted to the very few best cells. Typical values for the 

tuning parameters are 100 for    ,   ,   . To force a better optimization, nr may be set to 5, 10 

or 50 (Whatelet, 2005). Tests had generally shown that better misfits are obtained with fewer 

iterations if nr is low, but the inversion is more trapped in local minima. The exploratory mode 

(e.g.   =100 and   =100) usually provides better final misfits if the inversion is conducted with 

a great number of iterations. The number of iterations ranges from 50 to 200. This makes a total 

of 5,000 to 20,000 generated models. Compared to linearized methods, the number of forward 

computations is greater. Consequently, the forward computation has to be correct for each 

parameter set without a visual check, and it must be highly optimized to reduce the total 

computation time. 

The neighborhood algorithm is used in different studies at different scale. Sambridge  (1999) and 

Snoke (2002) employed it for the receiver function inversion at crustal scale, Whatelet (2005) 

refined it further and utilized it for the surface waves inversion at engineering scale. Recently the 

NA algorithm was used by Hobiger et al (2013) and Lontsi et al (2015) for ellipticity inversion 

with supplementary information. The interested reader is referred to the paper review  for a very 

detailed procedure about neighborhood algorithm. (Sambridge, 1999a and 1999b also Wathelet, 

2008) 

5.4. The parameter setting for the inversion 

For an Earth model made of homogeneous horizontal layers, four parameters (shear wave 

velocity Vs, thickness h, P-wave velocity Vp and density  ) can fully describe the computation 

of both dispersion and ellipticity curves. The parameter listed above, which affect the shape of 

both dispersion and ellipticity curves, are given in decreasing order. Specially, the P-wave 

velocity and density have very little effect on dispersion curve (Xia et al 2002) and we will try to 

check its effect on ellipticity in next chapters. For linearized inversion, the ground structure is 

divided into layers of fixed thickness, while Vs are allowed to set as free parameter by fixing Vp 

or Poisson ratio for the whole structure. However, Wathelet (2008) pointed out that by taking Vp 

values for fixation from refraction data has its own uncertainties and, fixing Vp values from 

refraction survey will penalized the result at the end. Therefore, it is suggested to keep Vp and 

Vs as free parameters linked by Poisson ratio, and the density value are fixed to some value. 

Both Vp and Vs can be defined within a range for lower and upper bound, this sets the physical 



 
 

59 
 

range of parameter space. Taking a large number of layers above bedrock will confined to 

concentrate the generated models around a median depth due to central limit theorem (Wathelet, 

2008). Therefore, Wathelet suggested setting up the depth range of the bedrock instead of fixing 

the thickness of each layers so, in this way, thickness also become as free parameter. The 

presence of low velocity zone in the subsurface complicates the forward model estimation 

because of in case of stochastic inversion, like neighborhood procedure, the random generation 

of model would be impossible to generate a model for the target curve, which contains low 

velocity zone (Wathelet, 2008). This problem is dealt by trial and error, however, if the area for 

which the inversion is made has a linear velocity increase, then the model are generated without 

the LVZ. In all our three tested sites for the study we have assumed a linear velocity increase 

trend and have not included the presence of any low velocity layer in the inversion.

Chapter 6: Modelling of the H/V curve 

 

6. Introduction 

 

Amongst the researchers working with the H/V techniques the most debated question was how to 

model the H/V curve with respecting the wave field that contributes in its subsistence. The 

purpose is to pinpoint the phases of the elastic wave which might be considered as the major 

contributor in its shape. Initially, It was believed that the ratio (H/V) is mainly influenced by the 

SH resonance frequency within the surface layers of soil above the bedrock. However,other 

researchers showed (Nogoshi &amp;amp; Igarashi 1971, Fah et al., 2001, Fah et al., 2003, Scherbaum et 

al., 2003) that seismic noise is mainly dominated by a surface wave and the shape of the H/V 

curve is actually subjugated by the shape of the Rayleigh waves ellipticity. This interpretation 

got allot of attention because of the peak and trough points alignment between the experimental 

H/V curve and theoretical ellipticity. However, in the case of considering the H/V curve as a 

proxy for the Rayleigh wave ellipticity, the H/V curve mostly reproduce the peak and trough 

frequency of the ellipticity curve but failed to match the amplitude of the ellipticity curve. To 

explain this mismatch between the amplitude, some of the studies concluded that this deviation 

in shape of the H/V curve are due to the presence of body and Love waves on the horizontal 

component of noise wave field around the peak frequency    (Arai &amp;amp; Tokimatsu, 2000 and 

Yamamoto, 2000). To incorporate the effect of body wave an effort was made by Sánchez-

Sesma et al. (2010; 2011) who considered the noise wave field as a diffuse field and attributed 

the H/V curve to all the seismic phases present in the noise wave field. Here, in this chapter, it 

will be outlined the major theoretical developments used to numerically model the H/V curve by 

different assumptions of seismic noise wave field and will compare its results with experimental 

H/V recorded at same site, whose velocity model were used to numerically model the curve.  

 

6.1 Nakamura explanation of the H/V curve 

 

Nakamura (1989) gave an explanation that, actually, this (H/V) simple spectral ratio technique is 

a very good indicator of shear wave resonance frequency of a site. He explained the H/V curve 

for the vertically SH incident wave case. However, his initial interpretation was faced with many 

controversies and objections, such as that H/V curve is not dominated by body waves but it 

contains a major contribution from surface waves (Bard, 1999). Nakamura re-evaluated his 

technique and included the effect of surface waves in the H/V curve modelling (Nakamura, 

2000). Here, a brief idea about his explanation is given. The explanation of wave amplification at 

the surface due to wave propagation from a hard rock through soil is achieved by the product of 

transfer function with the Fourier transform of the waves arriving at the bedrock. Therefore, the 



 
 

61 
 

motion produced at the surface by a horizontal motion at bedrock can be replicated by the 

transfer function multiplied to the Fourier transform of the horizontal motion at the bedrock and 

the Fourier transform of the surface wave as bellow. 

 

                                      (6.1) 

      is the horizontal transfer function between bedrock and soil surface (also known as 

frequency response),          is the Fourier transform of horizontal motion at bedrock surface 

due to the body waves,         ) is the  horizontal motion Fourier transform at surface due to 

the surface wave. Similarly, the motion produced by vertical component at bedrock at soil 

surface is given as 

                                       (6.2) 

the terms in Eq.6.2 are same as that of Eq.6.1 but for the vertical component of motion. The 

transfer function for the horizontal component of motion for a soil deposit over a bedrock, of 

velocity   , thickness h and damping (?) is given as (Kramer, 1996)  

      
 

        
   

          (6.3) 

where   
         ? . The expression for vertical transfer is the same function as Eq 6.3 

     , where   
  is replaced by   

  which is        ?.  To obtain natural frequency of the 

soil deposit the term in Eq 6.1 and Eq6.2 (                 cannot be used directly as it has the 

effect of sources that generated the waves. It is, therefore, common to take the ratio of 

                for source effect removal such as 

      
        

        
                 

        

        
       (6.4) 

where       is the transfer function for horizontal component motion Fourier transform at the 

surface, while the          is the horizontal component Fourier transform at the rock due to 

body waves. The element of the transfer function for vertical motion,      , has the same 

definition as that of      . Nakamura’s explanation of H/V is based on an assumption that the 

horizontal and vertical motion at the rock level,  (                  ) is equal such that their 

ratio is 1. To estimate the site frequency, Nakamura suggests to estimate the ratio,       

     , and called it Quasi Transfer function 

     
     

     
           (6.5) 

using the values of             from Eq6.4 in Eq6.5 results in 



 
 

62 
 

     
        

      
          (6.6) 

and putting the values of         and        from Eq.6.1, 6.2 and simplifying its results as 

     
                      

                      
 

     

     
  

      
        

     
 

      
       

     
 

      (6.7) 

as 
        

        
 is equal to 1 due to the assumption;  the quasi transfer function (    ) is equal to the  

      
      

        
     

 

      
       

     
 

           (6.8) 

if the wave field is dominated by the body waves (such as          0          0), Eq.6.8  

simplify as

In Fig.6.1 it can be easily observed that for soil deposit of thickness h (55m), Vs (420m/s), Vp 

(1500m/s) and damping factor ?         the vertical transfer function           is around 1

observed by Nakamura (1989, 2000). Nakamura suggested that if the surface wave dominates the 

wave fields then the shape of Eq.6.8 can be simplify as 

      
        

     
 

        
     

 
  

        

         
     
     

      (6.10) 

Where 
     

     
   in Eq. 6.10 (Nakamura assumption, 1989).  

It is assumed that in case of surface wave domination, the term          around the peak 

frequency decreases which results in a peak around the fundamental frequency    of the site. 

Therefore, even in case of the surface waves domination, the surface waves alone reproduced the 

transfer function. Comparing the result of Eq.6.9 with the H/V curve of recorded noise at the 

IAG borehole site, the peak frequency of the QTS match and has only a deviation of 4% from 

experimental H/V. A similar observation leads Nakamura (1989) to conclude that H/V basically 

gives the transfer function of a soil deposit. However, the amplitude of both H/V and result of 

QTS (Eq.6.9) rarely match. Another discrepancy of H/V curve is the difference in overall shape 

from QTS (Fig.6.2). That is why some of the authors concluded that the H/V basically serves as 

a proxy for the Rayleigh waves ellipticity rather than SH-transfer function (Nogoshi &amp;amp; Igarashi 

1971, Fah et al., 2001, Fah et al., 2003, Scherbaum et al., 2003). Bard (1999) reviewed, in detail, 

the Nakamura (1989) theory and rejected the possibility of H/V linkage with SH-transfer 

function of a soil deposit. In next section, we will briefly outline the Rayleigh waves ellipticity 

explanation of the H/V modelling.

6.2 Rayleigh wave ellipticity modelling of H/V curve 

In 1885 Sir John Strutt, Lord of Rayleigh, first observed the presence of Rayleigh waves on the 

surface of an elastic half space. Rayleigh waves are formed by the linear pairing of P (primary 

waves) and SV (vertically polarized shear waves) waves (Aki, 2002). This pairing of vertical and 

horizontal components has a phase shift of  
 

 
 . The particle motion induced by Rayleigh waves 

depicts an ellipse. This elliptical particle motion under the Rayleigh waves influence will be 

either retrograde or prograde depending on the sign of the phase shift. Similarly, Love waves are 

composed with horizontally polarized shear waves (SH). The horizontal over vertical 

displacement component at the surface, described by the particle motion under the Rayleigh 

waves influences results in a curve as function of frequency, which is termed as ellipticity (E) of 

Rayleigh waves. In the situation of homogeneous half-space the particle motion is retrograde at 

all frequencies and ellipticity is constant. However, in case of layered media (elastic, isotropic 

and vertically heterogeneous) ellipticity exhibits a peak followed by a trough, while the particle 

motion switch from retrograde to prograde and then to retrograde with the frequency, depending 

on the velocity contrast between the soil and bedrock (Konno &amp;amp; Ohmachi, 1998). Some 

researchers have shown that the H/V curve is actually depicting the Rayleigh waves ellipticity 

curve for a site (Nogoshi &amp;amp; Igarashi 1971, Fah et al., 2001, Fah et al., 2003, Scherbaum et al., 

2003). Here, we will briefly outline this modelling prospective of the theoretical ellipticity curve. 

When the Rayleigh waves travel through a media, it produces displacement of particle in 

horizontal and vertical directions. This displacement can be described in the form as (Aki and 

Richard, 2002) 

             
          

                (6.11) 

              
         

where r
1 

and r
2
 are the complex amplitude, for positive and real r

1 
, r

2
 the phase shift between 

these components       can be computed. At angular frequency  , the Rayleigh waves velocity 

is V
R 

=  /k. The phase shift between r
1 

and r
2
 is ?

 

 
 . When this phase shift is positive the motion 

is termed as prograde, while retrograde if the phase shift is negative. The stress components 

corresponding to this situation are given by 

 

          

          
   
  

                  
           



 
 

65 
 

          
   
  

           
                (6.12) 

                  
   
  

           
           

         
   
  

      
          

where           are the Lamé parameters       
   
  

                 which shows the 

amplitiude of radial shear stress     . Similarly,               
   
  

           

          which shows the amplitude of vertical compression    . Also, another important 

point to note is that the stress components         ,  should be continuous with respect to z 

(depth) 

 

              
                                    (6.13) 

               
                          (6.14) 

 

By combining Eqs.6.11, 6.12 and 6.13 the motion-stress vector       for Rayleigh waves can be 

written as  

 

  
 

  
  
  
  

  

 

 
 

  
                     

     
       

               

 ?                                             

                     ?                                 

 
 

 

  
  
  
  

   (6.15) 

where ?(z) = 4?(z) [?(z) + ?(z)] / [?(z) + 2?(z)], Aki and Richards (2002). 

 

The boundary conditions for Rayleigh waves are (disappearance of stress at the free surface z = 

0, and no motion at infinity) such as   

 

      
                                             (6.16) 

   
     

    at the free surface                           (6.17) 



 
 

66 
 

The interaction of incident P and SV waves with the free surface gives rise to an interference 

wave travelling along the surface as a Rayleigh wave (Lay and Wallace, 1995). 

 

The computation of forward modelling of dispersion curve and ellipticity from Eq 6.15  is based 

on the eigenvalue problem solved through propagator matrix described by Thomson (1950) and 

Haskell (1953), subsequently modified by Knopoff (1964), Dunkin (1965) and Herrmann (1994). 

We are employing a code which is based on the Dunkin's notations (see for detail Sesame report 

No. D14.07 (2003). For Rayleigh waves, the equations of motion are reduced to a system of 

simple differential with a derivative of the first order in z. To solve this problem numerically the 

original vertically heterogeneous Earth is modelled and replaced by a large number of horizontal 

layers (n+1) over a homogenous half-space (Fig.6.3). The properties of each layer are 

characterized by four parameters h, Vs, Vp, ? as function of depth z (thickness, shear wave 

velocity, primary wave velocity and density). The homogeneous half space is defined by Vs, Vp
 

and ?
 
only (shear wave velocity, primary wave velocity and density). 

 

 

Fig.6. 3 Shows the schematic one-dimensional model defined by a stack of (n+1) layers. zi are the depths of the top 

of each layer (modified from Aki and Richard, 2002). 

 

For the propagation of wave, in case of a stack of horizontal layers over the half-space, the 

problem is expressed by the differential Eq. 6.18 as 

 
 

  
                    (6.18) 

 



 
 

67 
 

where f is the general motion-stress vector of n components and A is a nxn matrix whose 

elements depend on the elastic parameters of the layers. When displacement is defined at a 

reference depth z, the vector f(z0) can be obtained through Eq.6.18. If A is independent of depth 

z, which is valid inside a layer, then Eq.6.18 provides a freedom of computing the vector f(z) for 

any arbitrary depth. 

 

                                (6.19) 

 

        is called Thomson-Haskell propagator matrix. It is a 4x4 matrix, function of depth at 
top and bottom of the layer, and matrix A. The         elements are calculated by the 
eigenvalue decomposition of A(z) and expressed in the form as (Aki and Richards, 2002) 

 

                            (6.20) 

 

The advantage of this approach is  that it can be used for a stack of n-layers (levels), where the n-

level is related with the reference on (  ) through the product of the matrix          relative the 
whole intermediate layers for any arbitrary depth    and expressed as  

 

                                                    (6.21) 

 

Eq.6.21 allows to determine the vector f(z) at each arbitrary depth, under the following 

conditions: the stress component being null at the surface (z = 0); both displacement and stress 

are assumed continuous on the correspondence of each surface between the layers and the one 

between the last layer and the half-space. The propagator matrix G is the functions of the depth 

at the top and at the bottom of each layer, and of the matrix A, which depends upon layer 

properties. It allows simulating the wave propagation into each layer of the model solving the 

series of equations (like Eq.6.21). However, the boundary conditions at infinite depth for 

Rayleigh waves (Eq. 6.15 and 6.16) can’t be solved directly.  At first this problem is transform 

into a radiation condition that no up-going waves are found in the bottom half-space and then 

Eq.6.21 is used to solved the motion stress vector for Rayleigh waves Eq.6.15. 

Ellipticity of Rayleigh waves is evaluated as the displacement ratio of horizontal and vertical 

component              at surface, which is estimated for a wave propagated from the bedrock 

to surface (see for detail, Aki and Richard, 2002). The solution (non-vanishing) for Rayleigh 

waves cases exist only at certain discrete wave numbers for a given frequency, which are termed 



 
 

68 
 

as eigenvalue for that specific frequency. The solution of Eq.6.15 for the specific eigenvalue is 

an eigenfunction of the problem. The pairs of eigenvalues and eigenfunction,                  

where i=1,M ,rk=1,2,3,4 for Rayleigh waved, each set of     
             defines a mode of 

propagation and, in general, there are M normal modes of propagation at any given frequency  .  

The ellipticity for IAG borehole model for the first 4 modes is shown in Fig 6.4. Note that 

ellipticity for fundamental mode exists for all the frequencies, while that one of higher mode 

exists beyond a certain frequency. So, usually it is suggested that the shape of H/V curve is 

dominated by fundamental mode of Rayleigh waves ellipticity up to the first minimum (Hobiger 

et al., 2013). Beyond the trough frequency, the influence of higher Rayleigh mode dominates the 

H/V curve. The peak and trough of the H/V curve mostly coincide with Rayleigh waves 

ellipticity peak and trough, however, there is a disagreement in amplitude between the H/V curve 

and ellipticity curve (see Fig.6.2). This discrepancy in amplitudes of both the curves is associated 

to the presence of Love waves on the horizontal component of noise wave field. In modelling 

prospective of ellipticity, it is easy to model a tabulated layered Earth case with thickness, 

density, Vp and Vs information. However, when dealing with experimental data there is always a 

chance of presence of other seismic phases (body and Love waves) contributing to the noise 

wave field. Therefore, taking experimental H/V spectral ratio as true representative of Rayleigh 

waves ellipticity might cause biased results. Hence, it is necessary to remove or minimize the 

effect of Love and body waves before considering a H/V spectral curve as closer representative 

of ellipticity curve for subsurface structure retrieval. We will list the available procedures for the 

minimization of Love waves effect from experimental curve in a final chapter with some 

experimental data. In next section, we will discuss the modelling of H/V curve considering both 

Rayleigh and Love waves.

6.3 H/V modelling on the basis of surface wave 

As described above, the shape variation of the fundamental mode of Rayleigh wave ellipticity up 

to the trough is responsible for experimental variation of H/V shape curve, while the amplitude 

of H/V curve deviation from the ellipticity is attributed to the fraction of Love waves presence in 

the noise wave field. So, what is the consequence if we model the H/V curve by considering the 

noise wave field is dominated only by surface wave? The first attempt in this direction was made 

by Arai and Tokimatsu (2000). In this procedure, total average spectral power is estimated by the 

integration on the horizontal plane. This integration is estimated analytically (Malischewsky, 

2015). Almost the similar approach was adapted, latter, by Lunedei &amp;amp; Albarello (2009) to model 

the H/V curve by total average spectral power. However, we will use the Arai &amp;amp; Tokimatsu 

(2000, 2004) procedure for modelling H/V curve as both gives almost the same results. Arai &amp;amp; 

Tokimatsu (2000, 2004) considered a model of N-parallel layers made-up from semi-infinite 

elastic medium, isotropic, solid, homogenous, where each layer is characterized by thickness Hi, 

S-wave velocity, Vsi, P-wave Velocity, Vpi, and density, ?i (Fig.6.5). For the numerical 

simulation of surface waves, they used Harikrider (1964) procedure. The authors also utilized 

Lachet and Bard (1994) procedure,  such as Fourier transform of vertical       and horizontal 

       point source having angular frequency ( ) and randomly distributed over the surface. 

From each of these points, waves are generated and propagated along the medium. As body 

waves attenuate quickly than the surface waves (Tokimatsu &amp;amp; Tamura, 1995), the displacement 

at an origin is considered to be produced by surface waves under far field source situation, which 

is, each distance between a source and origin (  ) is greater than the one wavelength of both 

Rayleigh and Love waves.

curves at two-test sites in Japan, where S-wave velocities were known from borehole 

measurements. Theoretical and experimental H/V curves (Fig 6.6) are in good agreement with 

each other. Indeed, while the ellipticity curves of the fundamental mode of Rayleigh waves,

6.4 Diffuse field assumption technique 

Starting the H/V modelling from the Nakamura QTS (SH waves incident) and later outlining it 

modelling with the ellipticity and surface wave domination, it seems that there was a constant 

desire to include body waves effect in the modelling. A very recent development in the 

modelling of the H/V curve is the combination of all the previous three explanations in terms of 

all elastic wave inclusion and considered noise wave field as a diffused field arises from the 

multiple scattering. Sanchez-Sesma et al. (2011) proposed to consider ambient noise wave field 

as a diffuse wave field, which contain all the different types of waves (surface and body). The 

ambient noise wave field is generated by multiple random uncorrelated forces/sources near to or 

at the Earth surface. The wave field may contain the scattering effect of various elastic modes. 

The field intensities could be better described by a diffuse like situation. To assume that the 

noise wave field is diffuse, the H/V curve can be estimated for a receiver at Earth surface in 

terms of Green tensor imaginary part at the source (source and receiver are assumed to be at 

same location). The work of Sanchez-Sesma provides an idea of linkage between energy density 

and imaginary part of GF in 3D (energy densities of the noise wave field is proportional to the 

imaginary part of Green tensor). The H/V curve, obtained from the square root ratio of imaginary 

parts of GF (horizontal and vertical components), Eq.6.42, serves as an intrinsic property of the 

medium and therefore, its inversion can be used to retrieved subsurface soil profile.  The detailed 

analysis of the procedure can be easily found in Sanchez-Sesma et al. (2011), García-Jerez et al., 

(2016) and Piña-Flores et al., (2017). A brief summary of this procedure is that autocorrelation of 

motion at a receiver sensor in a given direction is proportional to directional energy density 

(DED), and this DED is proportional to the imaginary part of Green tensor at that sensor 

(Sanchez-Sesma et al., 2011).   

Patron et al. (2009) showed that in case of 3D homogeneous elastic half space, the horizontal 

displacement (radial and transverse) has fix energy proportion (e.g., 

                                                       . For a diffused wave

indicated by    . The H/V curve obtained in this manner is linked to the intrinsic property of 
medium. The resulted H/V curve from the diffuse-field approach might allow its inversion 

without considering any supplemented information (dispersion curve). 

 

Integration in the horizontal wave number domain at specific frequency ( , ) is evaluated to 

imaginary part of Green function (Sanchez-Sesma et al., 2011). This integration in horizontal 

wave number domain was done to separate different elastic waves. Similarly, the contribution 

from surface and body waves is achieved by discrete wave number method like Bouchon’s 

(2007). However, recently, García-Jerez et al. (2016) adopted a new procedure to evaluate the 

integral. We are following García-Jerez et al (2016) procedure, here. In this procedure, the 

horizontal wave number components are extended to complex wave number domain. Latter, 

Cauchy’s residue theorem was utilized to estimate the surface wave contribution at simple pole 

along the real k axis (see for detail García-Jerez et al., 2016). The contribution of body waves to 

imaginary part of Green function are estimated by integration but at discrete intervals 

          where     represent the half-space shear wave velocity.  For the situation of

al. (2013; 2016) as

accurate locations of poles for the estimation of            are found by dispersion curve in 

( , ) domain (see for detail García-Jerez et al., 2016, Piña-Flores et al., 2017). For IAG borehole 

model, the H/V curve, under diffused field assumption from the given imaginary Green function 

ratios, are shown in Fig.6.8. The values of Green function given in Eq 6.43 and 6.44 are shown 

in Fig.6.9 for the same model. 

It is noted that, in this case of DFA, the H/V modelling is resting on the assumption that noise 

wave field is diffused. So, the question arise naturally that, is noise wave field really diffused? If 

the ambient noise wave field is diffused, it should fulfill the three criteria of general diffused 

field, which are:  1) The wave field (phases) should be random; 2) Waves should come from all 

the directions toward the receiver, which means that the wavefield must be isotrophic with 

azimuth; 3) The amplitude of incident waves should be same at a given point anywhere for a 

specific spatial domain. Mulagia (2012) followed these three criteria to seek its answer and 

statistically check these assumptions of diffused wavefield for seismic noise at 65 different 

geographic locations of diverse geological conditions and recording environments. He showed, 

statistically, that the seismic noise wave field is not diffused and the noise wave field is not 

azimuthally isotropic in all these cases.

Fig.6. 10 Show different curve comparison with that of H/V obtained from the noise tata recorded at IAG borehole

To draw the conclusion from the above analysis, we can easily observe that to model the H/V 

curve with surface wave domination noise field case gives a better result in a comparison with all 

other modeling techniques of the H/V curve (Fig 6.7). However, the shape of the H/V curve is 

dominated mostly by the fundamental mode of Rayleigh waves (as it present for all the 

frequency range, while higher mode occurs only for specific frequencies, Fig 6.4). Hence, for the 

inversion of the H/V curve, it necessary to remove the effect of Love waves presence. To find 

the fraction of Love waves that contributes to the noise wave field, it can be done from the 3 

component sensors array analysis (SPAC and FK method). However, for a single 3 component

Chapter7:  The peak frequency (  ) and shape of the H/V curve 
 

7. Introduction 

 

In the previous section, we outlined all the different theoretical developments that serve as an 

explanation for the H/V curve modelling. Although all these theories and explanations are used 

to interpret the H/V curves of experimental practices somehow equally, However, the ellipticity 

and DFA theory are those which require most attention. As indicated by Mulagia (2012), the 

noise field is not diffused and any assumption based on such hypotheses will lead to a biased 

interpretation of the data. However, any suggested theory to a physical model is an idea which is 

tested against reality (Piña-Flores et al., 2017). It can be said that every modelling technique of 

the H/V is footed on some assumption, for example, Nakamura’s (QTS, 1989) explanation is 

based on the assumption that wave field is dominated by body waves and that horizontal and 

vertical motions are same at bedrock level. The Rayleigh waves ellipticity theory of the H/V 

modelling is supported with the supposition of noise wave field domination by the Rayleigh 

waves. The surface waves dominancy of noise wave field (Arai &amp;amp; Tokimatsu, 2000-2004) 

exempt any body waves contribution. Recently, Lunedei &amp;amp; Malischewsky (2015) reviewed the 

development of the H/V modelling theories over time and concluded that the two main research 

lines are the ellipticity of Rayleigh wave and diffused field assumption for the explanation of the 

H/V curve technique. The H/V curve was first utilized only for the H/V peak frequency 

association with the fundamental frequency    of the site (Nakamura 1989, 2000). The peak 

frequency of the experimental curve match with S-resonance frequency of site when high S-

wave velocity contrasts exists between soil and bedrock (SESAME, 2004). However, the overall 

shape of the experimental H/V curve is generally higher than the ellipticity curve, except at the 

peak of the H/V curve (Tokimatsu, 1997; also see Fig.7.1). At the peak of the ellipticity, the 

vertical component vanishes and the peak of the ellipticity curve is elevated as compared to the 

experimental curve. This mismatch between the amplitude of the curves is attributed to the 

presence of body waves around the peak frequency   . As in the case of Rayleigh waves 

domination, the horizontal component vanishes, which gives rise to sufficiently higher peak, 

therefore this discrepancy in peak can be associated with the effect of body and Love waves 

presence on the horizontal component (Parolai et al., 2005). Sánchez-Sesma et al. (2010; 2011a) 

comes with a solution to consider the noise wave field as diffuse field and assumed equipartition 

of energy between two horizontal and vertical components or between P-waves and two 

polarized component of S-waves (       ) carrying 1/3 of total available energy. In this 

situation, the H/V can be obtained from the ratio of the Green function imaginary part of the 

horizontal and vertical components, which are obtained by the autocorrelation of the coinciding 

source and receiver over a layered medium. In the coming section, we will check the deviation of 

peak frequency of the H/V curve from S-wave resonance frequency based on these two main 

theories.

Fig.7. 1 Shows the comparison of H/V curve and the theoretical borehole ellipticity curve for the  IAG site; the blue 

shows the experimental H/V curve, while black line shows the borehole ellipticity curve. 

7.2 Peak frequency (  ) of the H/V curve 

As described above, one of the main uses of the H/V curve is to identify the resonance frequency 

   of S-wave (fundamental period of a site that maximum S-wave displacement amplification 

occurs). The H/V curve generally results in a peak which corresponds to the S-wave resonance 

frequency for high S-wave contrast between soil and rock. This peak frequency is used to obtain 

the average velocity within the sediment package if the depth to the bedrock is known by relation 

         . In the same way, the fundamental frequency of the site is obtained if thickness or 

S-wave velocity of soil layer is known in advance. We observed that the peak frequencies of H/V 

curves strongly depends on the average travel time of the S-wave to reach from bedrock to the 

surface (       ). Analogous travel time for diffrent models will result on the same peak 

frequency. This is elaborated for a simple case of one layer model with six different cases. For 

the six models in Fig 7.2, model A (h=400 m, Vsoil=800 m/s, T=0.5 second), model B (h=200 

m, Vsoil=400 m/s, T=0.5 second) and C (h=100 m, Vsoil=200 m/s, T=0.5 second) results on a 

fundamental frequency at 0.5 Hz (Fig 7.3). Similarly, the other three models, model D (h=100 m, 

Vsoil=400 m/s, T=0.25 second), model E (h=50 m, Vsoil=200 m/s, T=0.25 second) and model F 

(h=40 m, Vsoil=160 m/s, T=0.25 second) results on a peak with frequency of 1.01 Hz. These 

curves were obtained by the ellipticity and DFA based forward modelling. The dispersion curves 

of the model A, B, C and D, E, F are  also shown in Fig 7.2., which demonstrate that the 

dispersion of the Rayleigh waves begin at the frequency above the fundamental frequencies of 

0.5 and 1.01 Hz, respectively. This phenomenon was firstly observed by Tazime (1957) and 

Scherbaum (2003), that is, at the fundamental frequency of the site the medium act as filter and 

all the lower frequencies are filter out. Therefore, the dispersion of Rayleigh waves is only 

visible above the fundamental frequency of the site.

Fig.7. 3 Shows the H/V curve obtained via ellipticity (a) and DFA approach (b) for six different models shown in 

Fig.7.2. 

We analysed the effects of different seismic wave field contributions around the peak frequency 

and their deviations from the S-wave resonance frequency, by considering three different 

situations: (a) only the presence of the Rayleigh waves; (b) the effect of both the Rayleigh and 

Love waves; (c) the equal contribution from all the seismic wave types. In case (a) the exact 

ellipticity is estimated for layered Earth case by the Dunkin (1965) formulation, following the 

eigenvalue problem described in Thomson (1950) and Haskell (1953). Ellipticity is computed 

from the full stack of the eigenvalues and the fast root search algorithm by Wathelet (2005). In 

case (b), for the surface waves, the H/V is estimated by a method proposed by Arai &amp;amp; Tokimatsu 

(2000, 2004). In this case, the seismic sources, that generate the waves, are assumed to be 

continuously distributed on the surface of the Earth with independent phases. The total spectral 

power is estimated by integration analytically on the horizontal plane. The sources that generates 



 
 

81 
 

seismic waves are assumed to be located one wavelength (both surface) away to ensure surface 

wave arrival at the receiver. For the convergence of the power integral, Arai &amp;amp; Tokimatsu (2000, 

2004) considered an exponential damping factor generated by the scattering of surface waves in 

the subsoil layered model. In case (c) the DFA and H/V are estimated from the autocorrelation of 

a coinciding source and receiver (Sánchez-Sesma et al., 2010; 2011a). This autocorrelation 

results on the imaginary part of the Green function. The H/V is obtained from the square root 

ratio of the combined horizontal and vertical imaginary part of the Green function. 

The deviation of the peak frequency from S-wave resonance is demonstrated for IAG and a 

second model is taken from Hobiger et al. (2013). The peak frequency shift is obtained for the 

Poisson ratio ranges from 0 to 0.5. The Poisson ratio varied by changing the shear wave velocity 

of the first layer,    . For this range of Poisson ratios, the H/V curves were obtained by forward 

modelling by considering the seismic wave field of the three previous cases. The peak 

frequencies deviation from the S-wave resonance frequency is shown in Fig 7.5a. The relative 

errors of the frequencies peak for each case with S-wave resonance frequency are shown in Fig 

7.5b. It can be observed in Fig 7.5b that by considering the contribution from all the type of 

waves around, the peak shows little relative error with S-wave resonance frequency for all 

Poisson ratio range. However, the relative error in frequency estimated for Rayleigh and surface 

waves case is less than 10% for the Poisson ratio range 0.4 to 0.5. Similarly, the relative error 

between the S-wave frequencies is shown at Hobiger et al (2013) model in Fig.7.6c. Again, the 

relative error in frequencies estimated for Poisson ratio 0.4 to 0.5 is lesser. The typical range of 

Poisson ratio for the soil of engineering importance is 0.4 to 0.5 (Sharma et al., 1990, 

Davidovici, 1985). The Poison ratio of 0.4 of the soil layer signify that Vp in the soil layer 

should be 2.4 times higher than    . In general, this Vp is three-four times higher than S-wave 

velocity in the soil layer (Nakamura 2000). So, if this is the case then even Rayleigh waves 

domination of noise wave field closely match the S-wave resonance frequency.    

This analysis showed that, incorporating the contribution of body waves into the main peak of 

the H/V curve, the relative error of the S-wave resonance frequency is lesser, comparatively. 

However, it still does not match completely with the S-wave resonance frequency. The reason 

might be the proportion of body waves considered, which might not be the true one as in the case 

of DFA, where an equal contribution is considered for all the seismic waves. Concerning the 

experimental procedure of the H/V, mismatch with Rayleigh waves ellipticity indicates that the 

peak of the H/V curve contains the effect of both body and surface waves (Hobiger et al., 2009). 

That is why the peak of the H/V curve closely follows S-wave resonance frequency (SESAME 

2004) as compared to the other case of wave dominancy around the peak.

7.3 Sensitivity analysis of the peak frequency    for ellipticity and DFA H/V curves 

As described above, at present the two main modelling techniques commonly used for the 

experimental H/V curve modelling are ellipticity and DFA (diffused field assumption). We have 

also discussed that the most important information derived from the H/V curve is the peak 

frequency of the curve, and hence, important information about the site are estimated from this 

peak frequency such as thickness and Vs0 (Parolai, 2002, Ibs-von Seht, 1999, Tuan, 2015). It is 

of prime importance to check the sensitivity of these peaks for both ellipticity and DFA H/V 

curves to the layer parameters Vp,Vs, h and ? (P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity, thickness and 

density of mass). This analysis is done under the assumption that. apart from modelling a 

physical problem, it is of equal importance that the modelling solution should be sensitive to the 

real Earth properties as well. So, our aim was to check which of the H/V modelling techniques 



 
 

84 
 

(DFA or ellipticity) give more sensitivity to the Earth parameters that it should be more suited to 

be adopted for the inversion for H/V curve. 

Xia (1999) analysed different layer parameters (Vs, Vp, ? and h) that can affect the shape of the 

Rayleigh waves dispersion curve for a given model. The goal was to find that parameter which 

affects less or more the dispersion curve. By knowing the less affecting parameter, it can be 

omitted from the inversion analysis to reduce the number of the unknown during the inversion. 

The Rayleigh-wave phase velocity (dispersion curve) is the complicated function of four 

parameters: S-wave velocity, P-wave velocity, density ? and thickness of the layer h.  Xia (1999) 

observed that the most affecting parameters influencing the Rayleigh-wave phase velocity curve 

are the shear wave velocity, thickness, density and primary wave velocity, respectively. Here, we 

modified Xia (1999) dispersion curve and re-plotted it as slowness vs frequency (slowness is 

used to clearly observed the effect of parameters variation on higher frequencies). The frequency 

range used for the analysis is 0.2 Hz to 20 Hz (this range of frequencies is commonly used for 

H/V curve for the near surface engineering application). The model used for demonstration is 

taken from Xia (1999, Fig7.7). The effect of these four parameter changes is displayed in Fig 

7.8.

parameters (solid line shows the profile of Vs, while dotted line the Vp profile). 

 



 
 

85 
 

 

Fig.7. 8 Shows the contributions to Rayleigh-wave phase velocity by 25% changes in each model parameter  (Vs, 

Vp, ? and h). The solid black line (not visible clearly due to overlapping of density and P-wave change based 

dispersion curve) is Rayleigh-wave phase slowness attributed to the Earth model. The dispersion of each parameter 

change is shown in with different colours (modified from Xia 1999). 

 

In the same manner, the modelling of the H/V curve is done for layered Earth model where each 

layer are characterized by properties of Vs, Vp, ? and h. Checking the most affecting parameters 

on the peak frequency of the H/V (ellipticity and DFA approach) that will be detailed in this 

section. Usually, the analysis should be done with real data to check the sensitivity of these four 

parameters (shear wave velocity, thickness, density and primary wave velocity) on the peak of 

the curve. However, to test the effect of one parameter on the peak frequency (i.e., Vs) the other 

parameters (Vp, h, ?) should be kept constant to observe its influence clearly. However, in real, 

such a preferred situation is approximately impossible. Therefore, the only scenario left is to 

check the effect of this parameter for different models with forward modelling and simulation 

with the two mostly used procedures for the H/V modelling/inversion. The positive side of such 

analysis is that at a single time one of the parameters (Vs, Vp, ? and h) of the ground model is 

altered, while keeping all the other properties fixed. The change with H/V peak and shape is 

documented for this parameter variation and a general behaviour identification for later use. The 

IAG and Hobiger et al. (2013) models are used for this analysis, too. The models have four 

layers over the bedrock at 55 m and 200 m (Fig7.9). These four layers velocity were reduced to a 

sediment package of one layer over the bedrock to easily handle different parameters change 

analysis and also for the fact that H/V analysis are sensitive to the travel time taken by S-wave to 

reach the surface from bedrock (Fig 7.9).

Fig.7. 9 Shows IAG-and Hobiger models, (a) and (c); solid line shows Vs profiles, while dashed lines show Vp 

profiles. (b) and (d) are the IAG and Hobiger models reduced to one layer above the bedrock (Vs profiles only).  

7.3.1 Thickness (h), density, P-wave and S-wave velocities effects on the peak frequency 

From the sensitivity analysis, we found that the first parameter, which affects the peak frequency 

of the H/V curve (for both ellipticity and DFA) the most, is the thickness (h) of the soft sediment 

package. This effect of thickness on the peak frequency (fundamental frequency) has been 

observed extensively by Scherbaum (2003). Here, we extended this analysis to the deviation of 

the H/V peak frequency from the S-wave resonance and also included the DFA based H/V curve 

in the analysis. The scheme is to change (increase and decrease, respectively) the sediments 

package thickness by 50%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10% and 5% of the original thickness (IAG model, 

55 m and Hobiger model, 200 m; Fig.7.10). The peak frequency of the H/V curve is observed to 

the shift toward the lower frequencies in case of increasing thickness, while shifted toward 

higher frequencies in case of decreasing thickness of the sediment package for both ellipticity 

and DFA approach H/V curves (Fig. 7.11). Both the Rayleigh waves ellipticity and DFA 

approach H/V show a similar trend in shifting the peak trend. The shift of peak frequency from 

that S-wave resonance frequencies are shown in Fig. 7.12. The deviation in peak frequencies 

from the S-wave resonance frequencies in case of IAG is greater compared to the Hobiger model 

case (Fig 7.12a,b). This shift of ellipticity peak from S-wave resonance frequencies is higher 

almost 11% for different thicknesses. However, we observed that the peak frequencies of the 

ellipticity curve closely match the S-wave resonance frequencies when the Vs-contrast between 

soil and bedrock is 3.6 or higher (see, for example, Fig 7.19). The Vs value for the rock of IAG 

model we used is 1300 m/s, while for the soil we used 400 m/s, which give a Vs contrast of 3.25 

lesser than the 3.6. So, we increased the Vs contrast up to 3.6 by taking bedrock velocity at 1440 

m/s. This Vs contrast increase when checked for the thickness variation and compared with S-

wave resonance frequency gives a deviation of almost less than 5% overall (Fig 7.13c). The 

deviation in peak frequencies between ellipticity curve and that of the S-wave resonance 

frequency is even less than 3% in Hobiger model case, where the Vs-contrast is 4.6 between soil 

and bedrock velocities. This analysis shows that for high-velocity contrast (3.6 or higher) the 

deviation of ellipticity peak from S-wave resonance frequency is less than 5%. So, we can say 



 
 

87 
 

that in the case of high-velocity contrast the ellipticity modelling of H/V gives a satisfactory 

result for the S-wave resonance frequency. 

 

Fig.7. 10 Shows the thickness variation for IAG and Hobiger models. 

 

 

Fig.7. 11 Shows changes in thickness vs change in frequency peak of ellipticity curve; the peak shifted toward the 

lower and high frequencies with increase and decrease of thickness, respectively, for both ellipticity DFA 

approaches. Colours are assigned to each increase and decrease along with Vs profile.

H/V curve. (a) IAG model, (b) Hobiger model and (c) IAG with high Vs-contrast 3.6. 

The second and third checked parameters which effect on the peak frequency, for both the 

approaches, were density (?) and P-wave velocity contrast (Fig. 7.14 and 7.16). The P-wave 

velocity contrast and density contrast changes have no effect on the peak frequency of both 

ellipticity and DFA curves (it is shown at IAG model).

The last parameter checked for the effect on the peak frequency was shear-wave velocity contrast 

for both the Rayleigh waves ellipticity and DFA approaches. Velocity contrast was changed 

relatively between sediment package and bedrock (Fig.7.17). The shear wave velocity ratio 

between bedrock and sediments packages were kept 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.5, 2, 1.5 and 1.2, 

respectively. The peak frequency of the H/V against Vs contrast is having a clear peak when the 

Vs ratio of sediment and bedrock is 2.5 or higher, for both the cases. The ellipticity peak 

frequency deviation from the S-wave resonance frequency is less than 7% when the Vs contrast 

between soil and bedrock is 3.6 or higher. We observed for both the cases of thickness variation 

and velocity contrast variation, that the deviation from the S-wave resonance frequency are lesser 

(less than 5% of thickness variation and less than 7% for Vs-contrast) when the Vs contrast is 3.6 

or higher. Though, experimental H/V curves, most of the time, failed to reproduce the amplitude 

of the ellipticity curve. However, the analysis showed that, in the case of high-velocity contrast 

(3.6 or higher), the ellipticity modelling of H/V curve matched with S-wave resonance frequency 

closely, except at peak amplitude (Fig 7.1).

trough frequency to that of peak frequency of ellipticity; (c) shows the combined plot;  the vertical black line shows 

the Vs ratio 2.6 from where the effect Vs contribute smoothly. 

We observed that another strange behaviour of peak frequency is the shift of the peak frequency 

with Vs contrast (Fig.7.20). The trend of the peak frequency shift showed that when the Vs 

contrast is lower than 2.61, the peak frequency of H/V increases rapidly until the Vs contrast of 



 
 

92 
 

2.61. Afterward, the frequency of the peak decreases and stabilizes to a constant value with 

increasing Vs contrast. Similarly, another observation made by Konno &amp;amp; Ohmachi (1998) that 

peak to trough frequency ratio is almost 2 for high Vs contrast and higher Poisson value soil 

layer. The peak to trough ratio decreases with Vs contrast until 2.61, and then stabilizes to a 

constant value of 2.1 above Vs contrast 3.6.  

 

Fig.7. 20 Shows the combined plot of ellipticity peak frequency shift with Vs contrast increase (green) and the ratio 

of peak to trough frequency (red). The vertical bar indicates the Vs contrast 2.61 from where both curve stabilize.  

The peak frequency analysis of these parameters variation and their deviation from the resonance 

frequency show that, in the case of considering the contribution of all the seismic phases around 

the peak frequency, a very little deviation from the S-wave resonance frequency is expected. 

Similarly, in the case of higher Vs velocity contrast (3.6 or higher), the ellipticity peak deviation 

from the S-resonance frequency is very little. For the inversion procedure, this peak frequency 

region contains very undefined contributed seismic phases and should not be considered for the 

inversion around this peak frequency of the experimental H/V curve. 

7.4 The shape of the H/V curve 

As we discussed in the previous section, around the peak of H/V, the contribution to the 

horizontal component might be attributed to the Love and body waves presences due to the 

reason that the amplitude of the curve never reproduce the ellipticity curve at peak (Tazime, 

1957) (Scherbaum, 2003). In this case, it follows the shear wave resonance frequency closely. 

Now, to view the whole shape of the H/V that what type of wave dominates the shape of the H/V 

curves, we took five models from the different areas and estimated the H/V curve for all the 

major modelling techniques discussed in chapter 6. The shapes of the curves for these different 

modeling cases are compared at Fig. 7.22. It is clear that in all the cases the modelled curve is 

following the Rayleigh waves fundamental mode ellipticity shape. It is, therefore, very 

straightforward to say that the overall shape of the H/V curve is controlled by the Rayleigh wave 

ellipticity, while deviation of amplitude at peak is controlled by the presence of body/Love 

waves on horizontal component. The discrepancy in amplitude for the whole curve is controlled

by the presence of Love wave on the horizontal component. Recently, Pina-Flores et al., (2017) 

showed that the H/V curve is dominated by the surface waves above the peak frequency, while 

below the peak frequency the effect of body waves dominate the noise wavefield. The idea of the 

importance of the Rayleigh wave ellipticity can be easily established by observing the shape of 

the H/V curve in terms of peak and trough coincidence (Fig 7.22). The DFA based H/V curve in 

all the model's cases closely follow the shape of Rayleigh waves ellipticity peak and trough (Fig 

7.22).

7.5 The numbers of layers and effect on the shape of H/V curve 

The most intriguing question to ask is: does the H/V curve shape changes with the number of Vs 

contrasting interfaces within the structure of the subsurface target? If the shapes are changing, 

what is the number of layers, up to which the H/V curve for both the DFA and ellipticity 

approaches, is sensitive to the subsurface layer structure till the bedrock? The two H/V 

modelling techniques were utilized (ellipticity of Rayleigh wave and DFA) to demonstrate this. 

The models used for this forward modelling analysis are IAG-borehole and one taken from 

Greece (Lontsi, 2015; Fig 7.21). The Greece model was taken because it has the maximum 

number of layers among the models (Fig 7.21). The number of layers of both the models is 

increased in such way that peak frequency of the curves should not vary more than ?5% of the 

original peak frequency of the one layer model by adjusting the S-wave average travel time. The 

number of layers is increased from 1 layer over half space to 10 layers over half space (bedrock) 

for both the models. The deviation of the curve shape from one layer model upon increasing the 

number of the layer are found as 

                      
 

 
  

           
 

   
     

 

         
                               (7.1) 

 

where           is H/V curve at frequency fi for one layer model,  
 

   
     is H/V curve at 

frequency fi for n layer model (n=2,3,4....10), N is the number of data point, 100 in this case. Eq. 

7.1 measures the mean deviation of n-layer model relative to one-layer model. Higher is the 

                       mean more sensitivity to the number of layers. For both modelling 

techniques, the                       is estimated with different number of layers. The results 

are shown in Fig 7.24 and 7.25.  They show that the deviation between for different number of 

layers relative to one-layer model is higher in case of  Rayleigh waves ellipticity case, while 

lower in DFA based on H/V curves for different layers model.

Fig.7. 24 Shows IAG model with a different number of layers for both ellipticity (a) DFA H/V modelling 

approaches (b) with corresponding shape deviation from one layer model in (c) and (d). 



 
 

96 
 

This analysis indicated that maximum deviation between the shape of the H/V curve relative to 

one-layer model when the number of layers of the subsurface target is 3 and 6 for  both ellipticity 

and DFA based H/V curve for IAG model (Fig.7.24) and 6 for ellipticity and DFA for Greece 

model. Beyond this threshold number of layers, the deviation of the shape curve relative to one-

layer model again decreased. Based on this analysis we can say that the maximum possible 

number of layers up to which the H/V curve is capable of carrying information and could be 

retrievable is 6. However, this does not mean that it should be fixed to the number of layers to be 

6 layers in each of the H/V inversion case (when considering H/V curve as ellipticity curve). The 

number of layers for each inversion case should be started with a simple case of one layer, and 

then increased to the number of the layer by looking at the misfit. A general layers number used, 

for almost all the case till now, for the H/V and dispersion curve inversion is 4 (Hobiger, 2013 

and Wathelet, 2008). It is recommended that, in the case when there is no prior information 

about the subsurface structure, the usual number of the subsurface layers to be chosen for the 

inversion is 4.

Chapter 8: The use of peak frequency of the H/V curve 

 

8. Thickness frequency relation 

The characteristic site period, that depends on the thickness and shear wave velocity of the soil 

(as described in the previous chapter), provides a very useful sign of the vibration period at 

which the most significant amplification can be expected. Despite of the knowledge of types of 

wave which dominates the result of the H/V curve around the peak, luckily, for the purposes of 

estimating the soft sediment thickness, the H/V technique can be employed for the measurement 

of resonance frequency (Konno &amp;amp; Omachi, 1998; Ibs-von Seht &amp;amp; Wohlenberg, 1999; SESAME 

2004; Bonnefoy-Claudet et al., 2008; Tuan et al., 2011) which can be used to obtained sediment 

thickness above the seismic bedrock. In the case of the H/V curves, as it has been observed 

extensively, the peak of H/V curve corresponds to the shear wave resonance with good accuracy 

(SESAME, 2004). This simple method of ambient seismic noise recording provides us 

information about the fundamental period or fundamental frequency (f_0) of a site, which plays a 

very important role in hazard mitigation analysis such as earthquake microzonation. A relation 

between the fundamental resonance frequency and thickness of the soft soil can be estimated for 

the control point (borehole), which later can be utilized for a larger area. This thickness 

frequency relationship is usually found out by the regression analysis of thickness and peak 

frequencies obtained for those boreholes sites. This     relationship strongly depends on the 

shear wave velocity and thickness of soil and, hence, relies on the average travel time of shear 

wave in the soil package (as shown for six different models in chapter 7). To obtain this     

relationship for an area, there should be borehole control points scattered in the study area, where 

it should measure the ambient noise and estimate the H/V curve for peak frequency retrieval to 

make a relation between thickness of soil from boreholes and these peak frequencies. However, 

these desired situations often do not meet. Here, in this section, we are suggesting to estimate 

this     relation with the help of dispersion curve (obtained with any active source technique 

SASW or MASW). This new procedure is highlighted for the two theoretical models and used 

latter for the Bebedouro area, where we have ambient noise measurements at seven borehole 

sites and have six MASW survey profiles to utilize the dispersion curves. 

In most cases, the trend of velocity increases with depth in recent deposit sediments. This 

increase in the velocity is associated with the compaction caused by lithostatic load increase. 

Faust (1951) analysed experimental data and proposed a non-linear relationship between Vp (P-

wave velocity), Z (depth ) and    (age of the strata). 

           
 

   (8.1) 

Chandler (2005) generalized it for the shallow sedimentary structure (&amp;lt;4 km) on the basis of the 

experimental data. The Chandler empirical relationship can be written with little modification as  

 



 
 

98 
 

       
 

                       (8.2) 

 

where       is the average shear wave velocity with depth Z and    is the velocity at one meter 

depth. Usually, the trend velocity is estimated from one meter depth onward. Therefore, the 

depth Z, to put Z=z+1 in eq.8.2, it becomes as 

 

             
             (8.3) 

 

In general form, eq.8.3 can be written as  

 

             
           (8.4) 

 

where x is the shear wave velocity increase its dependence according to depth. As it is obvious 

from Eq.8.4, the values of    and x are required to get the general increase trend of shear wave 

velocity. Usually, these values are estimated from the borehole data analysis. Both these values 

vary from site to site. The literature review on this topic provide three general relations 

(Albarello, 2011) for the different geological setting  

 

?   = 210 m/s and x= 0.20 for compact soils 
?    =170 m/s and x =0.25 for sands 
?    =110 m/s and x =0.40 for rework or very recent soils 

 

Deriving the formula for thickness frequency relationship, let’s assume that a trend velocity 

increase in the unconsolidated soil deposit it is in the form of Eq. 8.4. Let h be the thickness of 

the soft soil, then the travel time T required for S waves to travel through distance h is given as 

 

    
  

     

 

 
           (8.5) 

 

Replacing       with its value from Eq8.4 and integrating with the limits, result as

    and   
  

   
 are empirical constants. As Eq.8.9 is derived based on 

average time taken by shear wave velocity to travel through the soil deposit of thickness h, so 

let’s call this relation as time based thickness frequency relation. The appearance of      in Eq 

8.9 suggest the idea that the relation between thickness and frequency will have different a and b 

values for different areas (as      will have different values for each site).  For example, the two 

thickness-frequency relation developed for Cologne, Germany and the western Lower Rhine 

Embayment, Germany are given as 

 

       
        (Parolai 2002)        (8.10)  

      
       (Ibs-von Seht 1999)        (8.11) 

Eq. (8.10 and 8.11) are developed from the regression analysis of the H/V peaks and the depth of 

the bedrock from the borehole control points. As described above, the thickness frequency 

relationship for different localities will have different a and b values because of the 

different     . Therefore, in general, fixing values of these constants a and b will be certainly 

bias to each geological setting. Another thickness frequency relationship was recently derived by 

Tuan et al. (2015). He used the transfer matrix (Haskel, 1953) method to derive an explicit 

equation for the multi layered situations with fixed bottom. These approximate equations are

then generalized for the model of a functionally graded material (FGM) layer over the half-space 

(Eq.8.12). The positive side of this formulation is considered by deriving the effect of density 

and the position of sub-layers (for more detail, look at Tuan, 2015).

8.1 How to estimate the value of       

 

Both in Eq.8.9 and 8.12, the two unknowns  are the shear wave velocity at one-meter depth and 

the shear wave velocity increase trend (x), which is generally find out from the borehole velocity 

analysis. However, it is difficult to have a calibration of borehole for these values at each site. 

Here, we are suggesting and estimating these values        from the phase velocity dispersion 

curve. To elaborate the procedure, the analysis is initially made for the two theoretical 1D 

models (A and B, Fig.8.1). The values of       can be indirectly obtained from the interpretation 

of the effective Rayleigh wave dispersion curve. The fundamental mode of Rayleigh wave 

dispersion curve coincides with the above framework of rough idea of estimation parameter 

      (Albarello et. al., 2011). Some authors have suggested, on the basis of empirical evidence, 

that the average S-wave velocity up to a depth of h roughly corresponds to the relative Rayleigh 

waves phase velocity to a fixed wavelength of the order of 1 ÷ 3 times h (Konno &amp;amp; Kataoka, 

2000; Martin &amp;amp; Diehl, 2004; Albarello &amp;amp; Gargani, 2010). According to relation, the Rayleigh 

wave velocity approximately matches with S-wave average velocity up to bedrock depth 

(Albarello, 2011)
 
 

 

      =1.1VR(f)  as  h=(
   

   
 
     

 
)        (8.13) 

 

Eq.8.13 gives an idea that dispersion curve obtained from the MASW, or any other array 

technique, can be utilized to infer the values of     . In this case, we are using the best fitting 

technique between shear wave velocity and depth obtained from the dispersion curve directly for 

the two models (A, B). For each point of the dispersion curve, shear wave velocity and depth are 

estimated by using a rough approximation 

 

     = 1.1VR(f)     Depth h =

The model A contains four layers over the half space at 200 meter (the composite thickness of 

soft sediments is 200 m, Fig 8.1.a), while model B is considered to have the same number of 

layers over the half space at 100 meter depth (Fig 8.1b). The number of layers above the half 

space is arbitrary, as our focus is to find the composite thickness of soil over the bedrock (half 

space in this case).  

 

 

 

Fig.8.1 Model A and B. (a) and (b) show Vs profiles (solid lines) while dash line show average S-velocity trend 

obtained from best-fitting;  (c) shows fundamental mode dispersion curve for models A and B; (d) shows the 

fundamental mode ellipticity curve for both models. 

 

The theoretical dispersion curve of the fundamental mode was estimated using Dunkin (1965) 

formulation, which was modified from Thomson (1950) and Haskel (1953) following an 

eigenvalue problem. The theoretical ellipticity curve is estimated for the models A and B (Fig 

8.1d) from a stack of eigenvalues for each layer. The stepwise procedure adopted were: 1. The 

dispersion and ellipticity were estimated for the models A and B (Fig 8.1c,1d);  2. The shear 

waves velocity and depth were estimated for each Rayleigh-frequency points (100 points are 

considered for theoretical models) of dispersion curve using Eq. 8.13; additionally, peaks of 

ellipticities curves for model A and B are considered as fundamental frequency       

                     Fig.8.1d); 3. The best fit was passed through shear wave velocity and 

depth points and the rate of increase of the shear wave velocity with depth x was obtained (Fig 



 
 

102 
 

8.2); 4. The    values were estimated from            , where V was the velocity at the 

surface estimated from the best fit (it can also be roughly approximated from the VRayleigh 

dispersion curve values at higher frequency when available).  

The values obtained from this procedure for the theoretical models (A:                , 

B:      )= 112, 0.40) were input to the Eq.8.12, and composite thickness for soft sediment over 

bedrock were estimated (A: h=205.8 m, B: h=104.5 m by Tuan relation Eq8.12 and A: h=174 m, 

B: h=81 m by average time based on relation Eq 8.9). The analysis of the theoretical models 

results for the thickness estimations suggest that Tuan (2015) relation provides a better estimate 

in contrast to the average time travel based relation. The same procedure can be adopted for 

actual field cases, and  will be further investigated in the coming section.

shear wave velocity obtained is b=0.35 for A (top); the same procedure is done for model B which result in b =0.40 
(bottom).

8.2 Thickness frequency relation for the Bebedouro area 

In the Bebedouro area, the seismic noise measurement was made next to seven water wells 

where we know the exact depth of sandstone and basalt interfaces from the drilling information. 

The seismic noise measurement was made next to these water wells. The fundamental 

frequencies of these water wells sites were estimated from the H/V analysis (Fig.8.3, Table 8.1) 

and linked to the sandstone top by the regression analysis to find the thickness frequency relation 

for the Bebedouro area (Fig 8.4). The Bebedouro area contains two geological interfaces near the 

surface, soft sediments followed by sandstone layer and fractured basalt. However, we could not 

find any prominent peak for the basalt interface as the velocity contrast were not might sufficient 

to result in a peak for the basalt sandstone interface. Therefore, we limited the       relation of 

the soil and top of the sandstone layer (Fig.8. 4). The regression analysis equation has an average 

error of  ? 8% (minimum 1% and maximum 15%) with actual thickness estimated from the 

wells. This result will be compared with the results of Eq 8.9 and Eq.8.12. Prior to that, let’s find 

out the      for the sites.

8.3       values estimation for the Bebedouro area from MASW dispersion curve 

To find the values of       for the Bebedouro area we used six MASW profiles. Four of the 

MASW profiles were recorded in 2008, being them BEB 4a, BEB7, BEB 11 and BEB1, and two 

new profiles BEB 4b and BEB 16b were acquired  in 2015 (Fig.8.5a). The dispersion curves 

from these MASW profiles were used to estimate the shear wave velocity increase trend for the 

region. The BEB 4b MASW profile was used to obtain three dispersion curves for different 

source intervals (Fig.8.7). We tried to directly invert these data from the Rayleigh wave velocity-

frequency to shear wave velocity-depth through the relations           and         
 

  
   for each frequency point. The shear wave velocity is linked to Rayleigh wave phase velocity 

through Poisson ratio such as 
  

  
 

          ?

  ?
 (where    is the Rayleigh wave phase velocity,    is 

the shear wave velocity and ? is the Poisson ratio). The Poisson ratio for the near surface 

application varies from 0.4 to 0.5. Therefore, let’s consider the Poisson ratio is changing from 0 

to 0.5. The corresponding  
  

  
 ratio to this range of Poisson ratio increases from 0.862 to 0.955. 

The shear wave velocity trend obtained through the best fit line of the Vs-depth points are given 

in Fig 8.7. An important point to note is that, if the Vs increases, the depth trend should not vary 

if the surface geology of the area is not changing abruptly. All the three curves shown in Fig.8.7 

were obtained from different source-receiver intervals of the same BEB 4b site from active 

source 30 meter forward (a), 15 m reverse (b), and passive source curve (c).

stars show the location of water wells; the wells used for a thickness frequency relationship are shown in Table 8.1. 

 

Fig.8.6 Shows the dispersion images of all the MASW profiles (Fig.8. 5)  black lines. 

To observe the effect of the Poisson ratio variation on the velocity increase trend, we analysed 

the same dispersion curve of BEB 4b and changed the Poisson ratio from 0 to 0.5. The velocity 

increase trend was kept constant at 0.3369 in all the cases (Fig 8.8). This analysis showed that 



 
 

106 
 

the change of Poisson ratio only affect the velocity at the surface (a=V in best-fit relation) and 

hence, have no effect on the velocity increase trend.

source curve; on the lower right statistical robustness and values of data fit are given. The values of (  ) and x are 

same as all these curves are taken from same site MASW. 

 

 

Fig.8.8 Shows the effect of Poisson ratio changes on velocity increase trend with depth for different Poisson ratios. 

The black dots shows the Vs-depth data while the blue line shows the best fit to the data. The value of x remains 

constant at 0.3369. 



 
 

107 
 

The value of the     variation for the Poisson ratio range 0 to 0.5 was found out for the IAG 

borehole model. The Poisson ratio was changed by changing the velocity of the soil layer and    

values were estimated by Eq8.4 for the whole range of Poisson values. These values of    for 

different Poisson ratios and the corresponding velocity increase trend with depth are shown in 

Fig.8.9. Note that the value of the x used, 0.42, was estimated from the best-fit of Rayleigh wave 

dispersion curve for IAG model. 

 

Fig.8.9 Shows the IAG model and the corresponding velocity increase trend (x= 0.42) for different Poison ratio (?) 

of the soil layer. The Vo values as a function of Poison ratio are given in (b). 

Similarly, like Beb 4b, four other dispersion curves were obtained for different source intervals:  

(a) 30 meter forward, (b) 30-meter reverse (c) 10 meter forward and (d) 10-meter reverse at BEB 

16b, shown in the Fig 8.10. The same procedure was applied and the best fit was passed to get a 

sense of increase velocity trend with depth. It is clear from the analysis of Fig 8.10 (a, b, c) that 

the velocity increases with depth trend is around 0.33. However, a little increase to 0.38 in depth 

dependence of velocity Fig 8.10(c) is observed. This deviation in x is most probably associated 

with erroneous picking off the dispersion curves. The interesting fact, which can be noted here, is 

that the distance between these two sites (BEB 4b and BEB 16b) is almost 10 km from each 

other and still the values of x (velocity dependence on depth) are almost similar. Similarly, at the 

other sites (BEB 1, BEB 4a, BEB 7 and BEB 11), the dispersion curves were directly inverted 

and the Vs-depth trend were obtained (Fig 8.11). The fundamental mode of the dispersion curve 

is considered in all these cases to obtain the shear wave velocity increase trend with the depth. 

The velocity dependence on depth value is the same for almost all the six MASW acquired sites. 

The values of a depend on the local setting and they are highly varying only among the two sites 

BEB 4a and BEB 11. The four rest sites showed almost similar velocity at the very near surface.

reverse, (c) 10 meter forward and (d) 10-meter reverse. The value of in power law relationship obtained from Fig 8.7 

is kept constant at a=137.

109 
 

To estimate the thickness frequency relation from Eq 8.9 and 8.12, we need the values of     , 

this is desirable for later comparison to see the deviation in both of experimental thickness-

frequency relation. The values approximated from the dispersion curve indirect inversion and 

fitting are taken as x=0.34 and   =171. These values were used in Eq 8.9 and 8.11 and thickness 

frequency relation were obtained by

       (8.16) 

Both of these equations results were plotted along with the experimentally derived relation in Fig 

8.12. To observe the error produced in thickness estimation of all these three relations, we have 

plotted the estimated thickness, with the ? one standard deviation at each frequency points 

(Fig.8.13). The standard deviations were found out in the three thickness estimates at an each 

given frequency (0.2 to 20 Hz). The plot was rescaled for various frequency ranges vs. the 

corresponding thickness to clearly observe the deviation in different thickness estimates 

frequency range.

8.4 Deviations in thickness estimates among the three equations 

The thickness estimated from all the three relations are shown in Fig.8.13 with an error bar of ? 

one standard deviation. The thickness estimate values lies almost within the error bar of each 

other. The observation of the error estimates in thickness measurement are done by finding out 

the relative error between a reference equation and the other two relations. Here, we have 

considered the average time based and Tuan (2015) relations as a reference as its derivation are 

based on the mathematical background rather than empirical analysis, like regression analysis in 

the Bebedouro case. Then, the relative errors were found out in the Bebedouro thickness-

frequency relation by considering as reference either the Tuan or time average equations. The 

relative error are shown in Fig.8.14. The relative error plot in thickness estimates shows the 

different zone of frequencies where the relative error of either Tuan or average time relation is 

giving good results when compared to the regression-based relation. 

The analysis of the relative error demonstrates an error of 1.5 % in thickness estimated at 0.1 Hz, 

and 15% at 20 Hz with regression relation for Tuan thickness estimate (Eq8.12) and 13 % at 0.1 

Hz to 2 % at 20 Hz with regression for average time relation (Eq8.9). At a glance, the average 

thickness estimates with time-based relation are in close proximity with regression relation. 

However, we used the Tuan relation for the situation where the dominant frequency 

(fundamental) of the site is 0.3 Hz up to 1.2 Hz otherwise the average time base relation for the 

higher frequencies. The relative error between Tuan and average time-based relation shows a 

constant error of 11% when Tuan is used as reference measure for thickness and a constant error 

of 12% when the average time-based relation is used as reference measure. The point where the 

relative errors with regression analysis are changing is actually the point where the Tuan and the 

average time-based lines cut the regression analysis equation line. 

In conclusion, it can be said that in situation where the thickness frequency relation is not in hand 

due to the unavailability of control (borehole) points, a dispersion curve can be used to obtain 

these values of     , which can be utilized to obtain the local thickness frequency relation for a 

site using Eq.8.9 and 8.12. The range of frequencies of dispersion curve used for      retrieval 

values are site dependent. To ensure a better result in fields, two different dispersion curve 

should be obtained for the two nearby sites. If the dispersion curves of both the sites show the 

dispersion in the same frequency range, then any of the dispersion curves can be used for      

retrieval values, otherwise, if one dispersion curve shows a spread in wider frequency range 

compared to the other, the curve with wider frequency range should be used for this velocity and 

increase trend with depth estimation for regression analysis.

Chapter 9: Part of ellipticity and misfit function 

 

9.1 Which part of ellipticity curve should be used for inversion? 

 

In the previous two chapters, the shape and the peak frequency were analyzed in terms of wave 

field and also, the importance of the peak frequency for the thickness-frequency relation. As we 

have shown, the shape of the H/V curve is dominated by the Rayleigh wave ellipticity, especially 

fundamental mode till the first trough, thus ellipticity curve is of great interest for the subsurface 

structure retrieval. However, it is first necessary to infer which part of ellipticity is carrying the 

most relevant information regarding the velocity structure. In particular, the resonance frequency 

   is of great concern for inversion because it carries information about the depth of bedrock. 

However, as we have seen in the previous chapter, a constant travels time for the shear wave in 

soft sediment has same fundamental frequency peak regardless of thickness and velocity. So, the 

peak of H/V curve depends on the ratio between the thickness of the soft layer and the average S-

wave velocity of the sediment package. Therefore, to get the thickness of soft sediment or the 

average velocity of soft soil from the H/V curve, we must have either information about the 

shear wave velocity of the soil or the thickness. This direct estimates obtained via    helps to 

constrain the thickness of the sedimentary cover when some information such as h-    

relationship for the given area is available or knowledge about the local Vs profile are in hand. In 

this section we will analyze which part of the ellipticity is carrying the most relevant  

information of the subsurface. We will use the same model of the borehole of IAG site for this 

analysis. It should be notted that ellipiticty curve alone does not provide sufficent information 

about the subsurface soil structure (Scherbaum, 2003). The inversion of the dispersion and 

ellipticity curve alone give very  differing results (Fig 9.1). The dispersion curve inversion misfit 

has a clear minimum while that of ellipticity inversion gives a clear trade-off between the 

velocity and thickness of soil (the dispersion and H/V curves have diffrent senstivity for the layer 

parameter (S-wave velocity, thickness of soil). 



 
 

113 
 

 

Fig.9.1 Shows the distribution of the misfits as a function of the surface velocity (v0) and layer thickness (d). The 

upper panel corresponds to the dispersion curve misfits while the lower panel corresponds to the ellipticity misfits 

(Scherbaum, 2003). 

 

This trade-off in ellipticity approach can be observed by changing the number of layers of IAG 

model while keeping the same velocity contrast between the soil and bedrock. A similar 

ellipticity curve (having a peak ?5% of one-layer frequency peak) were obtained (Fig 9.2). The 

velocity structure was changed by having one to four layers in the soil above the bedrock. This 

gives an idea that if we try to utilize the peak frequency only for the inversion, it will provide a 

biased resultThe only visible deviation at these different models ellipticities is at the right limb, 

which shows that the right flank till the minimum of the ellipticity is the important part which is 

controlled by the velocity structure of site within the soil. So, one can qualitatively guess  that 

the right limb of ellipticity (from peak to trough) should be used for the inversion, because it is 

the only portion of the ellipticity varying with altering the number of layers and hence, velocity 

structure within the soil. Another  important point to make here is that,  at the horizontal 

component of seismic noise wavefield the Love effect is present. The Love wave effect is more 

prominent at singularities (peak and trough) of the H/V. At peak frequency, the vertical 

component of noise wavefield vanish (Bard, 1998). The total contribution around the peak is 

then from the horizontal component of Rayleigh, Love and body waves. At the trough frequency, 

the horizontal components of  Rayleigh wave vanish, so the total horizontal energy is attributed 

to the Love wave and body waves contribution. Beyond the trough frequency, the influence of 

higher modes might lead to misestimating of the different Rayleigh mode ellipticities (Bard, 



 
 

114 
 

1998). So, the right flank till the trough of the ellipticity seems the most reliable part of an 

ellipticity curve for the inversion along with other information like the dispersion curve. 

 

 

Fig.9.2 Shows the four models and their corresponding ellipticity curves. The same model of the IAG borehole by 

considering one, two, three and four layers above the bedrock. 

The H/V curve techniques are strongly conditioned by the properties (thickness of sediment 

package and impedance contrast) of the interface between the sediment and the bedrock (Parolai 

et al., 2005), while it is poorly informative about the S-wave velocity of the sedimentary layers 

(Fig 9.1). On the other hand, the dispersion curves of the array technique (i.e., MASW) 

constraint mainly the S-wave velocity structure of the subsurface soil. However, the dispersion 

curve provides very uncertain information about the deep subsurface velocity structure, 

especially below the fundamental frequency of a site due to the filtering effect of the media. 

Therefore, when either H/V or dispersion curves are used singularly for the subsurface structure 

retrieval, there is a un-resolvable trade-off between the model parameters (velocity and thickness 

of the soil layers) that hampers the inversion analysis results. So, it is usually suggested to invert 

H/V and the dispersion curve  jointly (Fig 9.3). However, it is a cumbersome process to map out 

a large area by acquiring both the ambient noise and MASW measurement at each  location. 

Sometimes one (i.e., noise recording) measurement is acquired easily while the other are difficult 

to acquire because of accessibility limitation (i.e., the Colônia site swampy condition).

Fig.9.3 Showing joint inversion of ellipticity and dispersion curves. The black dotted line shows the IAG borehole 

data ellipticity and dispersion curve. On the right, the result of inversion is shown; the black line shows the true 

model. 

If the geology of the area where Vs measurement up to the bedrock desired has a smooth 

geological setting, then we can expect that the shear wave velocity will increase smoothly with 

depth (i.e., Bebedouro). The MASW measurement at some of the locations of the whole 

investigation area can be utilized to obtain this shear wave velocity increase trend for that area. 

This shear wave velocity increase trend can then be used to invert the H/V curves obtained in the 

whole area by using this information of Vs increase trend and velocity at near surface 

information or information about the thickness of the sediments package obtained via     

relation. As we have discussed above,  the ellipticity inversion alone always gives ambigous 

result, therefore, this  addtional information of velocity (shear wave) or thickness will reduce the 

unresolovable trade-off between thickness and Vs velocity. 

Forward modelling is performed to obtain the dispersion curve of the of the borehole model. This 

dispersion curve is indirectly inverted by using each point of dispersion curve to obtain depth 

and Vs value   ach point of the dispersion curve gives depth and S-wave estimate. These data  

are used to plot the best fit and to obtain the general trend of S-wave velocity with depth. The 

values obtained for the IAG model were    =134 m/s and x=0.42 (Fig 9.4). These values 

(  =134 m/s, x=0.42 ) are used to get velocity at 55 meter (around 750 m/s). Similarly, we have 

seen that the most affecting parameter on the ellipticity curve is the thickness of the sediment 

package following by effect of shear wave velocity. If the sediment thickness and H/V peak 

relation for an area is not available, then the values    =134 m/s, x=0.42) are used to estimate 

this relation. The relation can be use to find out the thickness of the sediment package (see, for 

example, the previous chapter for detailed procedure). This information of thikness and Vs help 

to resolve this trade-off between thickness and velocity during the inversion.

curve.  

9.2 Inversion of the ellipticity curve with velocity trend and thickness information 

For the inversion in this section, the number of layers is chosen to be four. For simple ground 

structure, the inversion converges very soon after the generation of very fewer numbers of 

models. We are not studying in detail the parameterization effect on the inversion, which was 

already done by Sambrige (2002) and Wathelet (2005, 2008). The parameter space for the 

inversion of the ellipticity curve is chosen such that shear and P-wave are allowed to change in a 

wide range. At the top of the sediment package, the velocity is selected as the velocity of one 

meter 50-250 m/s (in case of 134 m/s) and velocity at bottom is chosen on the basis of shear 

wave velocity increase trend by taking thickness information into account (750 m/s). We chose 

this velocity to be around 900 m/s. The velocity of bedrock is chosen to vary between 900 to 

3500 m/s. The number of layers from the top to the bottom of sediments package is chosen to be 

four. The density is fixed at 2000 kg/m-3. The Poisson ratio is chosen to lie between 0.2 to 0.5 

for the whole sediment package. For this case of four layers model over the homogeneous half-

space, the parameter space is 14 dimensional (five Vs, five Vp and 4 thickness). The original 

theoretical model is always included in ground model profiles with the misfit = 0 for the 

comparison. The theoretical inversion of this or any model will converge after a long time. For 

an inversion algorithm, even faster than Monte Carlo, it will requires infinite time to explore the 

complete parameter space. However, the usual goal of all the inversion processes is to find a 

model with acceptable fit to the data in some practical time. The number of models generated in 

all the theoretical section and later in the experimental data is kept limited to 25000, as in most 

of the cases. The inversion convergence was good after such number of model generation. The 

check of which part of the ellipticity is carrying the most important information is done by 

inverting different parts of ellipticity with the supplemented information regarding thickness and 

velocity at top and bottom of the sediment package. As we have the complete knowledge of the 

ground structure, it is easy to check the quality of inversion, that is, how good the model is 



 
 

117 
 

retrieved. So, it is essential to check and define a parameter to evaluate the quality (integrity of 

fit) of the inversion (Hobiger et al., 2013). If this integrity of fit is computed by comparing the 

theoretical Vs-profile to that of lower misfit inverted model, it will be problematic because of 

non-uniqueness. The inverted model may not have same layer thickness and bedrock depth with 

that of the theoretical one, but will have same phase velocity dispersion curve. Hobiger et al. 

(2013) suggested a parameter to check the quality of inversion with that of the theoretical model, 

termed it as the proximity value (T). They used this parameter to find the quality of joint 

inversion of autocorrelation curve with different parts of the ellipticity curve. The proximity 

value (T) is actually comparing the Rayleigh wave dispersion curve calculated for the lower 

misfit (best fitted inverted) model with the reference dispersion curve of the theoretical model. 

This reference dispersion curve is calculated for the given IAG theoretical model. The proximity 

value can be defined as

       is the theoretical model dispersion curve,      ) is the best fitted inverted model  at 

frequency (f), N is the number of frequency points. As the theoretical model dispersion curve do 

not has any measuring error, the measuring error present in misfit function is replaced by 

      . The value of T gives, somehow, a mean deviation of the inversion model from the 

reference model. Hobiger et al. (2013) suggested the T value to be around 90% match with 

reference model (theoretical model). However, a value of less than 0.1 can considered good fit to 

the model. 

We checked which part of the ellipticity should be inverted to retrieve the theoretical model from 

the inversion by using velocity trend and thickness information. Fig 9.5 to 9.9 show the inversion 

of ellipticity full (0.2Hz to 20 Hz), left limb (0.2 to 2.04 Hz), left limb-peak-right limb (1Hz-to-

3Hz) , right-limb up to trough  (2Hz-to-4.5 Hz)  and part beyond the trough of the ellipticity 

curve (4.5Hz-to-20Hz). The corresponding fit of the inverted models to that of theoretical and 

final model are shown in each corresponding figures (Fig. 9.6 to 9.10). Table 9.2 summarizes the 

results of all these parts of inversion along with misfit and T values.  

Fig 9.3 shows the joint inversion of both ellipticity and dispersion curves, after the generation of 

25000 models. The ground model is very well retrieved. Almost all the layers and velocity are 

very well retrieved. Fig 9.5 shows the inversion of the ellipticity curve only along with the shear 

wave velocity at the top and bottom of the sediment package obtained through dispersion curve 

direct inversion. The information for the thickness of the sediment package was obtained via 

thickness-frequency relation. In this case, the theoretical profile is not very well retrieved as that 

of joint inversion case in Fig 9.3, especially the depth of first and 3rd layers. However, as the 



 
 

118 
 

main purpose of utilization of the different techniques  recommended for microzonation is to find 

the average velocity of sediment package and depth of bedrock, which is of great importance for 

seismic motion amplification and hazard mitigation for a site, the use of shear wave velocity 

trend, thickness information along with the ellipticity curve inversion serve to fulfill this desired 

goal (to find average shear wave velocity of sediment package and its thickness above the 

seismic bedrock). The velocity of the bedrock (at 55 meters is  1300 m/s) is very well retrieved 

by lower misfit model.  

 

Fig.9.5 Shows the inversion of ellipticity curve along with S-velocity increase trend and thickness information. 

 

Fig 9.6 shows the inversion of the left limb (0.2Hz to 2.04Hz) of the ellipticity curve. In this 

case, the ground structure is not very well retrieved, although the inverted profile is very well 

fitted by the data of ellipticity with the lower misfit. However, the T values are high, which show 

a bad retrieval of the model. Fig 9.7 shows the left and right limbs along with the peak of 

ellipticity (1Hz to 3Hz). As the peak of ellipticity carries important information about the 

thickness of sediments, this peak frequency can be used to find sediment thickness if the local 

thickness-frequency relation exists. We found that the inversion result of this part is very 

essential for the utilization of inversion of ellipticity alone if the near surface velocity and 

thickness information are known in priority. Fig 9.8 shows the inversion of right limb of 

ellipticity. The T values are lesser and the model fit to the inverted model also shows a good fit. 

Fig 9.9 shows the inversion of the ellipticity curve above the trough. Although the data above the 

trough are very well fitted by ellipticity curve, the model and T-values retrieved shows a 

deviation.  



 
 

119 
 

This analysis shows that by incorporating both limbs around the peak frequency along with 

velocity trend and thickness information, the minimum misfit model is closer to the subsurface 

model. We tested the same procedure for another model taken from Picozzi et al. (2005) and 

from Lontsi (2015). The Picozzi et al. (2005) model is composed of five layers over the bedrock 

at depth of 240m. The frequency-thickness and S-velocity increase trend relation for the area was 

already developed by Parolai et al. (2002), which was used to estimate the thickness (280 m), the 

top and bottom of sediment package velocity values (50 m/s to 150 m/s and 950 m/s to 1200 

m/s). The velocity of half space was considered to vary between 950 m/s-to-3500 m/s, the 

density was considered constant and the number of layers equal to eight (the number of layers 

were chosen as it was used in the original study of Piccozi, 2005 and Lontsi, 2015). The 

inversion result is shown in Fig 9.10. The reference model of Picozzi et al. (2005) is retrieved but 

not in the absolute scale. The model integrity is tested by comparing the reference model 

dispersion curve to the best fit model dispersion curve to get the proximity value, T=0.04 

suggests a very good retrieval of the model. Lontsi (2015) model has seven layers above the 

bedrock at 195 meters depth. The velocity increase trend is obtained by using the dispersion 

curve obtained via forward modelling of this model (             . This velocity 

increase trend and      values were used to estimate the thickness-frequency relationship for the 

area (      
      

 . The thickness and velocity trend information were supplemented with 

ellipticity of the model for inversion. The inversion result is shown in Fig. 9.11. The T value for 

the best model is 0.13.  In this case, the model is not truly retrieved beyond the 80 meter depth, 

however, the overall velocity structure has a deviation of 18% of velocity below the 80 m 

between inverted and theoretical model. The surface wave methods are not sensitivity to map all 

the small contrasting interfaces but sensitive to map only interfaces with high contrast. The 

Lontsi (2015) model has interfaces whose velocities change very little bit among the first six 

layers. As mentioned earlier, the technique adopted to perform microzonation are required to 

provide the average shear wave velocity of soft sediment package and depth of bedrock. This 

velocity and thickness information supplemented based ellipticity inversion achieve the goal of 

that task very well.

This analysis showed that the trade-off between velocity and thickness for the ellipticity 

inversion can be minimized by the incorporation of S-wave velocity increase trend and thickness 

information. If the S-wave wave velocity increase trend is used with the ellipticity, this can, in a 

better way, replicate the subsurfaces-wave velocity structure.

9.6 Misfit function for the joint inversion 

Generally, an inversion process can be divided into three steps: an computational algorithm to 

compute the initial set of models, a mathematical procedure to estimate the theoretical target 

curve (dispersion or ellipticity) utilizing a prior range of parameters (Vs,Vp, h, ) for layered  

Earth model, and a computation procedure to minimize the misfit (this will be explained in 

coming section). As in the all random inversion algorithm processes (i.e., genetic, simulated 

annealing and neighbourhood) the number of models generated are quite large. The test all of 

these models ,that how close the response curves of these generated models are to the original 

target is done by a function known as misfit or cost function. The misfit is a quality control 

factor which pedals the performance of the inversion. Its value measures the deviation between 

the experimental and theoretically calculated values for the generated model for a layered Earth 

model. In case of uncertainty in the target curve data, the misfit function is defined for the 

dispersion curve inversion is given as 

 

              
                                

 

      
 
            (9.2) 

 

where               is the experimental dispersion curve at frequency fi,             is the 

estimated dispersion curve for the model under consideration at frequency fi,       is the 

uncertainty in the experimental curve measurement at frequency  fi and N is the number of data 

points for which this comparison between experimental and estimated curve is made. Similarly, 

the misfit value for the ellipticity (H/V) inversion is given as 

            
  

                            
 

      
 
           (9.3) 

 

where              is the experimental ellipticity curve at frequency fi,               is the 

estimated (theoretical) ellipticity curve for the model under consideration at frequency fi,       is 

the uncertainty in the experimental curve measurement at frequency  fi and N is the number of 

points for which this comparison between experimental and estimated curve is made. Both the 

equations (9.2 and 9.3) will result 1 if all the models fall within the standard deviation of 

experimental data (dispersion or ellipticity). This signify that the             and             

usuall acceptable value is 1 (Sambridge, 2001), which mean that a calculated model ellipticity or 



 
 

124 
 

dispersion curves must lie within the one standard deviation of experimental ellipticity and 

dispersion curves. An important point to remember here is that in case of no uncertainty in 

experimental curve, specially when active source is used for the theoretical measurement such as 

performed in this study, the term        in both equation 9.2 and 9.3 is replaced by 

the        
              

 
    . In case of joint inversion, the misfit at the end of the inversion 

is average for both ellipticity and dispersion curves such as  

 

                 
                        

 
       (9.4) 

 

However, this does not seem a very interesting approach, because it weights both the targets 

equally. Earlier, the joint inversion of H/V and dispersion curves was suggested around the peak 

and trough of the H/V curve due to the Love and body wave effects presence within the curve. 

For peak and trough consideration case only, the misfit of H/V curve was suggested by 

Scherbaum (2003) and Wathelet (2005) is given by 

 

                     
                                  

 

          
      (9.5) 

while for minima such as 

                    
                                    

 

          
      (9.6) 

 

where the                                      show the experimental ellipticity maximum 

and minimum values, while                                        show the modelled 

ellipticity maximum and minimum values and                          show the 

uncertainty at these maximum and minimum experimental ellipticity curve. The final misfit for 

these singularities points of ellipticity curve is average as 

 

                  
                                        

 
     (9.7) 

 



 
 

125 
 

However, a new problem arises here, which is how to weight this                   with the 

dispersion curve, which usually contains multiple data points. Two procedures are generally 

adopted for weighting each target in joint inversion. One is the averaging of the individuals 

misfit for both the dispersion and ellipticity (Hobiger, 2013), while the other is suggested by 

Wathelet (2005) is given as 

 

                                                   (9.8) 

 

In this case, the usual values of the   is 0.5, which means to assign an equal weight to both of the 

dispersion targets. Similarly,     means the inversion is completely based on the dispersion 

curve, while     means the inversion relies only on ellipticity curve. However, as the numbers 

of data sample for both the target are not usually the same, it is difficult to assign an equal weight 

to of both the targets. Piccozi et al. (2005) suggested a procedure to lower the values of   for one 

target at the expense of the other (reducing one target weight while increasing the other). By 

applying this trial and error method, we can choose the value for   which results in a lower 

misfit. We checked this procedure here for different values of   and found generally a good 

result of    ranges from 0.2 to 0.015. However, the disadvantage of this procedure is that the 

range of   changes for case to case and has no such common range of    values which could be 

recommended for the general usage.  

So, defining the misfit function seems very cumbersome. Usually, the Sambridge (2001) idea of 

an acceptance level for misfit is used to overcome this hindrance in the weighting of a different 

target. Sambridge (2001) suggested an acceptance level of misfit, which is, within certain misfit 

value, all the models in parameter space are taken from the model generated for the different 

target (dispersion and ellipticity curves). As acceptance level, Sambridge (2001) suggested that 

all the generated models should lie within one standard deviation of the target curve, 

                                              (fi)=1. For joint inversion of different targets 

(dispersion and ellipticity curves) the misfit weight is set to 1 for both the targets at the start of 

inversion, which will compel the algorithm to generate models within one standard deviation. 

The misfit values at the end are averaged out for both of the targets. The drawback of this 

approach arises simply from the question: are the standard deviations for both targets the same? 

The simple answer is no, because both the targets are obtained differently as the H/V curve is 

obtained from the ambient noise recording (will certainly have higher standard deviation), while 

the dispersion curve is obtained from active source, and will have little standard deviation 

(specially in our case).  

 



 
 

126 
 

Therefore, it is dearly required to define a weighting function for this joint misfit function. This 

new weighting function should use the span of data points for the different targets (dispersion 

and ellipticity curves) as a controlling parameter. We tried to obtain this weighting function from 

a simple proportion formula such as              ,  where n is the number of data points 

for ellipticity curve, m is the number of data points for dispersion curve,           are weighting 

functions of ellipticity and dispersion curves, respectively. The values of these weights are 

chosen such that their sum should be equal to 1 (            . This lead to define the 

weighting factor for both the targets as       
 

   
 and        

 

   
 .  Now, the joint misfit 

function for both the targets can be defined with their respective weighting functions as 

  

               
                                

 

           

 
             

                              
 

           

 
   (9.9) 

 

where               and                are the target curves for both targets (theoretical or 

experimental),                 and                are the modelled curves for both the targets 

at frequency f,             is the deviation in data measurement. If not available, it can be 

replaced with                and               in either case.  

We used the IAG model to demonstrate how this misfit function work for joint inversion of 

ellipticity and dispersion curves considering a different number of data points for both the targets 

and the result was compared in terms of target curves and the original model. Initially, the data 

points of both the targets were considered to be equal, n=m=50, followed by n=25 and m=50 

(Fig 9.12). This weighting function for both the targets           has an advantage which 

ensures higher weights for the target curve having less number of data sample, while the target 

having higher number of points get lower weight. This can be observed more clearly when the 

data points for ellipticity are reduced. The weight it gets higher as compared to dispersion curve 

(Fig 9.13).

Until now this newly defined misfit works well for the theoretical joint curves inversions as 

shown in Fig 9.12 and Fig 9.13. However, this new misfit does not give a satisfactory result for 

the experimental data inversion. We used Eq.9.8 for the experimental curves for our inversion, 

where the weights of ellipticity curve were chosen to vary between               .

Chapter 10: The inversion of ellipticity and dispersion curves 

 

10.1 Inversion of the experimental data 

 

To check the lessons learned from the investigations of chapters 7, 8 and 9, we processed some 

experimental data. The three different sites chosen for this are located at the state of São Paulo, 

Brazil (Fig 10.1). The three sites, University of São Paulo (USP), the Colônia and the Bebedouro 

were chosen while keeping in mind some distinct properties of each site. The USP site (in front 

of the IAG - Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciências Atmosféricas, cited here frequently as 

IAG and another site next to the IGc - Instituto de Geociências, cited here as IGC) has the 

advantage of the borehole data availability for the calibration and for the quality check of the 

inversion result. The Colônia site was chosen because of its geological significance, such as its 

bowl shape structure that is almost swampy and most of the conventional geophysical methods 

are difficult to be employed there because of the surface water and mud (there are some small 

patches of dry land which make it possible to install seismometer for noise recording and hence, 

the H/V analysis). The Bebedouro site was chosen because of the availability of seismic noise 

data recording as well as the multiple water wells subsurface interfaces data, from which the 

information about the subsurface interfaces were accessible and it was easy to test the thickness-

frequency relation. Among all these three sites, the two IAG-IGC and Colônia have a strong 

bedrock laying below the unconsolidated soft sediments. This is true for the Bebedouro area too, 

however, the surface sediments are stronger as compared to the pre-mentioned sites. The detailed 

geological description of these sites are beyond the scope of this chapter, however, a concise 

introduction will be presented for each of the sites here. In this chapter, initially, the geology of 

the sites will be briefly discussed, followed by the removal of Love waves contribution from the 

H/V curve, to make it a truer representative of the Rayleigh waves ellipticity, and then the use of 

its inversion with dispersion curve. At the end, it will be showed some new aspects for which the 

simple H/V could be utilized.

Fig.10.1 Shows the boundary (in red) of Sao Paulo state. Locations where the MASW and H/V analysis were made 

are shown in the red circles ((taken from Google earth. Imagery date April 2015. Access at March 2017). 

The IAG-IGC-USP site is located in the continental rift part of south-eastern Brazilian basins, 

specifically in the São Paulo basin. The São Paulo basin has an irregular shape comprised of an 

area of almost 1000 sq. km. It is mainly drained by the Tietê river and secondarily by Pinheiros 

and Tamanduatei rivers plus their tributaries (Riccomini, 1989, 1992). The São Paulo basin is 

geotechnical and geologically extensively investigated because most of it lies under the 

urbanized part of São Paulo city. The geology of the site presents predominance of clay-sand 

sediments of Resende and São Paulo formations, superimposed on the crystalline basement 

augen-gneisses composed of Precambrian age (Ricomini, 1989). The lithological information 

from the wells (Porsani et al., 2003) shows a sandy-clay backfill layer predominantly dark, 

sometimes with organic matter, with a variable thickness between 4.5 and 6 m. Sedimentary 

units of the Resende formation have two levels. The top consists of interbedded silty clay with 

coarse-grained sand that has thickness ranging from 11 to 14.5 m. The lower unit is composed of 

sandy-clay superimposed to a clay horizon, with thickness between 29 and 32 m, the sandy layer 

is 18 m thick and the clay layer 13 m thick at the end. The crystalline basement is composed of 

augen-gneiss with feldspar crystals. The top of the basement is fractured. The bedrock is at 52-55 

m depth in the site. 

The Colônia site is located in the southern suburbs of São Paulo city, Brazil (Fig.10.2). In the 

area, there is a structure with a circular geometry (diameter of 3,6 km) comprising an annular 

ring of hills surrounding a depression. The structure is mostly a swamp. Its origin is attributed to 

an impact of meteorite (Riccomini et al., 1989). The structure was formed in crystalline 

basement rocks of Neoproterozoic age and the depression is mainly filled with organic-rich 



 
 

131 
 

sediments of Quaternary age. The main rock types of the basement comprise schist, quartzite, 

gneiss, migmatite, diorite, quartz diorite (Sadowski et al., 1974). The upper sediments of the 

sedimentary infill of the depression described from a shallow drilling (Ledru et al., 2005, 2009) 

showed black, organic-rich, clayey sediment (peat) with some intercalations of fine sand. A core 

recovery of a groundwater borehole (Riccomini et al., 1991) showed the follows sedimentary 

column: i) predominantly organic-rich silty clay up to 200 m deep, approximately, with minor 

intercalations of sandy mud with quartz grains after 90 m deep; ii) from 200 m up to 260 m 

occurs intercalations of sandy mud with quartz grains and sandy mud with quartz pebbles; iii) 

starting from 260 m, approximately, occurs pebbly mud with some presence of Precambrian rock 

fragments suggesting to be a fanglomerate deposit derived from the elevated parts of the ring 

(Ledru et al., 2005), a representation of the initial filing, or to occurrence of a crater-fill breccia. 

The total depth, estimated by seismic reflection investigation (shown in Fig 10.2) which does not 

reach the central part of the structure (Riccomini et al., 2011) is around 340 m (sedimentary infill 

plus breccia).

MASW tests, while thin line indicates reflection line (modified from Riccomini et al., 2011). 

The Bebedouro site is covered by a layer of sandstone (Adamantina formation) with, usually, 50 

to 100 m thick. Below the sandstone is a basalt layer (Serra Geral formation) with a thickness of 

approximately 500m (Assumpcao, 2007). The geological map of the site is shown in Fig. 10.3, 

which shows the main geological units of the region. The sandstones overlie, in unconformity, 

the basalts of the Serra Geral Formation (Lower Cretaceous). In between, basalt sequence may 



 
 

132 
 

also occur with thin layers of sandstones. The surface of the terrain is smooth, in general, with 

elevation varying from 480 to 520 meters. 

 

 

 

Fig.10.3 Shows the geological map of the NE region of São Paulo State. The area is dominated geologically by the 

sedimentary rocks of the Bauru Group and basalts. 

In Bebedouro, sansdtones predominate Adamantina Formation and the underlied basalts of the 

Serra Geral Formation; these basalt layers extends westward under sediments (sandstones) of the 

Bauru Group. In Bebedouro and neighboring municipalities, fractured aquifers in this basalt 

layer are quite explored (Assumpção, 2007). 

10.2 Data acquisition parameters 

MASW and the H/V analysis were made at two sites in USP campus (São Paulo city) (Fig  10.4). 

One of the acquisitions was made in front of Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciências 

Atmosféricas (IAG) while the other in front of Instituto de Geociências (IGC). The 

measurements were made with a broadband 3 component sensor (Nanometrics Trillium Compact 

120-s) and the ambient noise wavefield recordings were made for 24 continuous hours on 

weekends to ensure minimum cultural noise influence. The ambient noise data acquisitions were 

done following the guidelines developed under the SESAME (2004) recommendations. For the 

fundamental resonance frequency estimation through H/V curve, the SESAMES’s (2004) 

processing recommendations were followed. Three sensors were used to record the seismic noise 

data at IAG site while two sensors were used at IGC site. IAG site contains three boreholes.  The 

noise measurements were made next to each borehole (Fig 10.5). The H/V curves of IAG and 

IGC site are given in Fig 10.6.

At the Colônia site, seismic noise recording was made at six sites (Fig 10.7) with the same 

sensors. The seismic noise recordings were made at different locations and similar processing 

was followed to find the H/V curve for each site. The two MASW profiles were recorded near to 

sensor 7 and 4 (Fig 10.7). The recording parameters of these and all the others MASWs are given 

in chapter 4. The H/V curves obtained for these sites are shown in Fig 10.8.  

The Bebedouro site has been monitored through seismometers installed for source 

characterization of induced seismic activity in the area. The locations of these stations and water 

wells are shown in Fig 8.5 (chapter 8). The H/V curves obtained from seismic noise recording 

next to 6 MASW profile are shown in Fig 10.9.  

The H/V curves obtained at these three sites could be considered a good approximate of the 

fundamental resonance frequency of these three sites. However, to invert these curves for the 

shear wave velocity, the contribution of the other seismic phases should be removed, as 

suggested by Bonnefoy et al. (2008). To make this analysis we will demonstrate this Love 

waves effect removal for seismic noise recorded at IAG site only, it is due to the borehole 

velocity (Vs) availability for calibration via forward modelling.

10.3 The retrieval of ellipticity from single 3c-station recording 

 

The H/V curve peak frequency alone can provide three distinct informations, fundamental site 

resonance frequency, the thickness of the soil package and the average shear wave velocity of the 

soil package above the seismic bedrock. These information's can be directly obtained from the 

H/V curve peak. To obtained the thickness and average shear wave velocity information of the 

soil package, the knowledge of    and the velocity increase trend with depth (x) are needed. For 

example, the IAG site fundamental frequency obtained from the H/V peak is 2.1 Hz. The values 

of           and x=0.42 were obtained from the dispersion curve direct inversion. These 

values were used to obtained the thickness of the soil package at the site (54 m) and the average 

shear wave velocity of the soil package (455 m/s). The depth of bedrock found from the borehole 

data is 53-55 m, while the average shear wave velocity of the soil above bedrock is around 393 

m/s (only 15% deviation from the Vs values obtained from the H/V curve peak). This procedure 

shows the direct utilization of the H/V curve. However, for more sophisticated inversion and 

better subsurface information retrieval, we, usually, employ an inversion procedure. In this 

procedure, the H/V curve is linked to some physical phenomenon, which is latter utilized for the 

inversion. For example, the H/V curve is closely linked with the Rayleigh waves ellipticity and 

these Rayleigh waves ellipticity characteristics are used to obtain the subsurface information.  

Most of the studies performed on the joint inversion of the H/V and dispersion curves were based 

on the assumption that H/V the curve truly replicates the ellipticity of Rayleigh waves. However, 

some earlier studies showed that the surface waves contribution to the horizontal components 

dominates over all the other phases of seismic waves, which constitute noise wavefield 

(Yamamoto, 2000; and Arai &amp;amp; Tokimatsu, 2000). Similarly, another observation established 



 
 

137 
 

from these studies is that Love waves contribution to the horizontal component may be higher 

than that of the Rayleigh waves. The same conclusion was endorsed by Bonnefoy-Claudet 

(2008). This fraction of Love waves contribution to the horizontal component is not constant and 

varies with time and from site to site (Kohler et al., 2006; Endrun, 2011) (also outlined in chapter 

2). Hence, a prior assumption (if not close to the real value) about the Love waves fraction at the 

horizontal component of the H/V curve might lead to erroneous results. So, it is of prime interest 

to remove the Love waves contribution from the H/V curve to make it closer to the true Rayleigh 

waves ellipticity and then proceed to the inversion.  

As described earlier, the H/V inversion was based on the conjecture that H/V completely 

corresponds to the Rayleigh waves ellipticity. The experimental H/V curve is usually unable to 

reproduce all the ellipticity curve characteristics (Tokimatsu, 1997). Tokimatsu (1997) observed 

that, except at the peak of the H/V and ellipticity curves, the H/V curve amplitude is generally 

higher than that of Rayleigh waves ellipticity (Fig 10.10). This deviation between the curves can 

be easily linked to the presence of the Love and other body waves phases to the noise wavefield 

at the horizontal component. The ellipticity peak ratio is amplifying more as compared to the 

H/V curve. Tazime (1957) and Scherbaum (2003) tried to link this Rayleigh ellipticity higher 

amplitude to the vanishing of the vertical component, around the site, fundamental frequency. 

Such as the fundamental resonance frequency, the medium acts as a filter which attenuates all 

vertical component contributions from the seismic noise wavefield. However, the H/V curve 

amplitude never reaches to match the ellipticity curve around this peak, but always remains 

finite. To explain this, one might link the non-vanishing of the vertical component around the 

site fundamental period to the presence of other seismic phases like refracted, reflected and 

converted body waves. The lowering of vertical component spectral amplitude around the 

resonance frequency can be easily observed. However, like the ellipticity curve, the vertical 

component spectra does not vanish; this makes sense if we assume that the body waves 

contribution to the vertical component. The Fig 10.10 shows the theoretical Rayleigh ellipticity 

obtained for the borehole P2 (Fig 10.5) and the H/V curve obtained from the noise measurement 

at the same site. The trough of both curves (ellipticity and H/V) does not perfectly match. This 

might be due to the argument that the borehole model is a representative single point while the 

H/V curve shape and peak is affected by the whole site local structure. Generally, the ellipticity 

curve is not considered for the inversion beyond the trough frequency due to the fact that from 

the trough onwards the influence of higher modes might dominate the curve (Hobiger et al., 

2013). 

 

The removal of the Love waves effect can be done by characterizing the distinctive properties of 

Rayleigh waves, which are different from the Love waves. This distinct feature can be later used 

for Love waves effect removal. Surface waves resulted from the polarized body waves coupled 

near to or at the surface, for instance, the coupling of P-wave and the vertically polarized shear 

wave (  ) produces Rayleigh waves (Aki 2002). A phase shift of ?     exists between the 



 
 

138 
 

particle motion induced by this P-waves and vertically polarized shear wave (  ). This coupling 

depicts an ellipse at the surface. The phase shift can either be positive or negative producing 

prograde or retrograde motion. Hence, the Rayleigh wave ellipticity can be defined as the ratio of 

horizontal and vertical displacement eigen-function at each frequency (at the surface) of the 

particle motion under Rayleigh waves influence. Love waves are horizontally polarized shear 

waves (  ) trapped within the soft layer above a rock of high shear wave velocity due to multiple 

reflections. This distinction can be utilized to minimize or even remove the effect of Love waves 

fraction from the horizontal components of the experimental H/V curve and make it closer to the 

ellipticity curve (Hobiger et al., 2009). 

 

As discussed, the presence of both surface wave types fraction has to be considered for inversion 

algorithms. The first technique proposed for this analysis is the classical polarization, where the 

H/V ratio obtained from the noise analysis is used for the Love waves effect minimization. The 

main assumptions on which this technique is based on are that, around the peak frequency of the 

H/V curve, the vertical component is mainly dominated by Rayleigh waves fundamental mode 

and the spectral content of the Love waves contributes equally to the horizontal components of 

the H/V curve. Hence, the H/V ratio amplitude should be divided by the    to remove the effect 

of Love waves (Fig 10.10). However, the Rayleigh/Love contribution, within the noise wavefield 

varies from site to site and its fraction, also strongly depends on frequency (Cornou, 2002). 

Hence, this equal contribution approach for Love waves effect removal from the horizontal 

component might lead to biased results. Therefore, to remove the Love waves effect, it should be 

used some more sophisticated approaches rather than a prior assumption about the Love waves 

fraction. Two procedures are suggested for this task of single 3c-station recording case: the time-

frequency analysis (Fah et al., 2009) and RayDec (Hobiger et al., 2009). We adopted both 

techniques in this thesis, to remove the Love waves contribution from the horizontal components 

of single station noise recording. A concise introduction of this technique is presented here. The 

interested readers are referred to Fah et al. (2009) and Hobiger (2009) for more details.

10.3.1 Time-frequency analysis 

 

As described in the introduction of this section, the main features that can be used, in a 

systematic way, for Love waves effect minimization are the polarization properties of both 

surface waves (Rayleigh and Love). The first technique employed for this job is the time-

frequency analysis. In this procedure, the Rayleigh waves vertical component is used as a 

distinctive property indicator of Rayleigh waves, which is lacking in the Love waves case. The 

vertical component energy level is estimated from the continuous wavelet transformation, which 

is later correlated with combined horizontal components energy maxima for the Rayleigh waves. 

The continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) is performed for all the three components of 

noise recording. This transformation projects the real-valued signal x(t) into a time-scale plane, 

where both the duration and bandwidth of the noise signal are controlled by this single parameter 

called scale. CWT can be defined as  

             
 

  
        

   

 
   

 

  
       (10.1) 

where x(t) represents the noise record (vertical or horizontal),  (t) is the mother wavelet, * 

illustrates a complex conjugation process,   is the scale parameter, and if t is the time then b is a 

translation in time. The wavelet generally chosen for CWT transformation is Morelet wavelet.  

The original Morelet wavelet was modified for the H/V analysis by Fah et al. (2009) as the 

original wavelet was not suitable for this analysis. This new modified Morelet wavelet is 

narrower in the frequency domain, which is better for the noise time-frequency analysis as 

frequency resolution is more substantial in this analysis (Fah et al., 2009). The modified Morelet 

wavelet is defined as 

     
 

  
          

    for           (10.2) 

Here, m serves as a single parameter that controls both time and frequency resolutions. The 

central frequency of the wavelet is     at scale a=1. Higher values for m means higher frequency 

resolution while low time control/resolution. Similarly, low value for m ensures more time 

resolution at the expense of frequency resolution. The value of m=1/2 corresponds to the 

classical Morelet wavelet.  

When the CWT is performed on the signal, its amplitude is obtained as a function of both time 

and frequency. The energetic arrival at the vertical component is chosen and the corresponding 

maxima on the horizontal components for the Rayleigh waves arrival is picked for the same time 

and frequency (Fig 10.11). The horizontal component selected response is delayed and advances 

at quarter of the period to compensate the theoretical phase shift ?
 

 
 between the vertical and 

horizontal components. The ratio between these vertical and horizontal responses is taken as the 

ratio for this specific time and frequency and is stored. The process is repeated for all the 

frequency and time translations, and the wavelet coefficients are statistically analyzed through 



 
 

140 
 

histogram. The detailed time-frequency procedure analysis can be found in Fah et al. (2009). 

Here, we checked the effect of two parameters, duration of the signal and m of the time-

frequency results with the borehole ellipticity.

combined horizontal (bottom) signals from noise record. The plus sign is taken as an example of maxima on the 

vertical component for Rayleigh wave detections. The ellipticity of these detected Rayleigh waves is estimated using 

the ratio between the horizontal and vertical maxima at this time and frequency, ? shifting the horizontal component 

by a quarter period at each analyzed frequency f.

the energy level; curly line shows the ellipticity obtained from CWT while solid smooth line shows the ellipticity 

curve obtained from the borehole data at the same location (IAG site).

values of m for one hour signal. The curly line shows ellipticity obtained from CWT while solid smooth line shows 

the ellipticity curve obtained from the borehole data at the same location (IAG site). 

 

From a comparison of the result with the borehole ellipticity at the site, we can suggest that for a 

better correlation with the right limb of the borehole ellipticity curve (Fig.10.13 c-d) ,the value of 

m (scale) should be in the range of 8-16. 



 
 

142 
 

 

 

10.3.2 Random decrement technique (RayDec) 

 

The other major technique used for the Love waves effect removal/minimization to make the 

H/V curve a truer representative of the Rayleigh ellipticity is RayDec (random decrement 

technique). RayDec is classically used to find the building dynamic properties using a single 

component signal. Hobiger et al. (2009) extended this technique to the three component signal 

analysis. The ellipticity retrieved from the single station noise recording through RayDec is 

nearer to ellipticity curve than the classical H/V division by     for the Love waves effect 

minimization. A brief outline of the method will be discussed here (for more detail procedure, 

see Hobiger et al., 2009). 

Consider a three component signal having N data point for each component, each of length T; 

the signal is, at first, filtered of bandwidth df centred at frequency f. The vertical component is 

considered as a master trigger similar to time-frequency analysis for the distinction of Rayleigh 

wave arrival. The vertical component of noise record is a search for all the times where the signal 

changes its sign from negative to positive; at each of these points, a signal of length segment   is 

stored for all the three components. The length of this segment   is chosen to ensure 20 

significant cycles at each analyzed frequency ( =20/f, where f is the analyzed frequency; 

frequency range 0.2 to 20 Hz is used).  

Both horizontal components are shifted by      to compensate the theoretical phase shift of 
 

 
?between vertical and horizontal components. The ratio between these stored segmented signals 

is found as  

   
            
 

 
 

    
 

 
        

           (10.3) 

The term hf.s (t) shows the average horizontal signal while Vf.s(t) shows the vertical component. 

For our recorded data, we analyzed a one-hour noise record similar to the one used for the 

previous analysis in the section above. There are two control parameters on which this analysis 

of RayDec depends, one is the choice of window length ( ) and the other is the bandwidth (df) 

of filtering. The effects of these parameters along with the duration of the signal are shown in Fig 

10.14.  The one-hour record is divided into 6 windows of 10 minutes each. Each one of these 

windows is analyzed separately and the ellipticity is discovered. At the end, the ellipticity for all 

these 6 windows is averaged out (Fig 10.14d). The ellipticity obtained is shown in Fig 10.14d 

along with the averaging error bar. The result shows a better match with the borehole’s ellipticity 

especially around the peak and some part of the ellipticity left and right limb. The choice of 

window length ( ) and bandwidth (df) for which we found better result are   
  

 
     df=0.4f.

10.4 Joint inversion of the ellipticity and dispersion curve for USP, Colonia and Bebedouro 

The ultimate goal of most of the near surface geotechnical and earthquake engineering is to 

evaluate the stiffness of an area. The stiffness direct relation with shear-wave velocity makes it 

possible to measure Vs-profile with some geophysical techniques from the surface recording. 

The retrieval of ellipticity from the seismic ambient noise for a single station recording by 

removing/minimizing the effect of Love waves made it possible to obtain the Vs- profile with 

little bit more accuracy than the all previous inversion of H/V and dispersion curves. To check 

this, we needed to jointly invert the dispersion and ellipticity curves for all the three sites, 

starting from the IAG site as it has borehole data available for quality check of the inversion 

result. The ellipticity of all three studied area were obtained through the RayDec technique. As 

shown, in both the case of time-frequency analysis and RayDec techniques, that the ellipticity is 



 
 

144 
 

well retrieved for the right limb of the borehole ellipticity (Fig 10.13d and 10.14d), the same 

observation is made by Hobiger et al. (2013) for the right limb. As the peak amplitude of the 

retrieved ellipticity does not match the theoretical ellipticity peak of the site, the data points 

around the peak are not considered in the three cases. However, as the peak frequency provides a 

better estimate of the proximal depth of the bedrock, some part of the left limb of the ellipticity is 

considered for inversion to confine and utilize this peak frequency. The experimental dispersion 

curve of the IAG site, along with the theoretical dispersion curve from the Vs profile of the 

borehole P2, is shown in Fig 10.15. The experimental dispersion curve was obtained from 4.6 Hz 

till 33 Hz, while the borehole model dispersion curve was obtained for the frequency range 0.2 

Hz to 50 Hz. However, it deviates from the experimental curve around 7 to 17 Hz. This deviation 

might be due to the fact that the borehole model dispersion curve represents a single point while 

the experimental dispersion is affected by the Vs structure of the whole area. The joint inversion 

of both the targets curve is shown in Fig.10.16.  

 
 

Fig.10.15 Shows the dispersion image of MASW recording line (Fig10.5). The dotted line shows the dispersion 

curve obtained from dispersion image while the dashed line shows the borehole’s model dispersion curve.

of IAG site with the dotted line while the black line shows the lower misfit ellipticity curve model; (b) shows the 

fitting to the experimental curve with the dotted line and lower misfit model dispersion curve with the black line; (c) 

shows all the generated models, the black line shows the lower misfit model. 

The inversions of different parts of ellipticity and velocity increase trend provide a better 

estimate of the bedrock velocity in the theoretical section (chapter 9), however, in the 

experimental ellipticity and dispersion curve inversion, despite of the better depth estimate of the 

bedrock, it failed to provide a good estimate of bedrock velocity (Fig 10.17). The reason for this 

might be the unavailability of the experimental dispersion curve for the lower frequency range to 

better constrained the bedrock velocity. 

 
 

Fig.10.17 Shows the lower misfit Vs model (solid line) of the joint inversion (Fig.10.16) and borehole Vs model 

(dashed line). 

 

We compared our recent results to the previous investigation at the site (Porsani et al., 2004). For 

all the models with misfit lower than 0.5, the bedrock depth retrieved from the joint inversion are 



 
 

146 
 

around 44-55 m, which is in very good correspondence with borehole (P2) depth 55 m. 

Additionally, lower misfit model shows bedrock at 53 m (Fig 10.17). The lower misfit model of 

joint inversion when compared to the borehole model (Fig 10.17) shows a maximum of 17% 

deviation in the velocity from the borehole model within the soil package. The bedrock velocity 

is not well constrained and has a 41% deviation with the borehole model velocity (Fig 10.17). 

Probably, the ellipticity curve joint inversion with a higher mode dispersion curve might provide 

a better constraint to the bedrock velocity as shown by Piccozi et al. (2005). However, it is not 

very common to observe higher mode dispersion curve and, even if one is able to retrieve the 

higher mode dispersion curve, the order of the picked curve remained always a mystery as higher 

mode appearance generally does not follow a certain order. As we do not have a clear higher 

mode dispersion appearance in our experimental curve (Fig 10.15), we limited to the 

fundamental mode dispersion curve only. The joint inversion performed here showed good 

average velocity trend retrieval with that of borehole shear-wave velocity. This velocity 

deviation within soil package between the borehole and joint inversion results might be due to 

the fact that the borehole result is confined to a single point, while the ellipticity and dispersion 

curve results are influenced by the whole local subsurface structure. The short summary of this 

site results shows that if we are able to minimize the Love waves contribution to the horizontal 

noise wavefield, the joint inversion will give good results in a very cost effective and easy way. 

The joint inversion of IGC ellipticity and dispersion curves are shown in the Fig 10.18. The 

bedrock depth for the lower misfit model in IGC case is a bit shallower (46 m). This shallower 

bedrock depth could also be inferred directly from the peak frequency of the H/V which is 2.5 

Hz as compared to 2.1 Hz at IAG case.

The Colônia experimental data recording had some limitation, especially in the dispersion 

curves, where it was very difficult to retrieve it for a broad range of frequencies. This 

disappearance of dispersion in Colônia could be linked to the presence of muddy clay with very 

lower cohesion. However, the dispersion curve was still obtained for a small frequency range 

(1.1 to 3.8 Hz). We have assumed this dispersion information to be the representative of shear-

wave velocity increase within the soil package and have inverted this information directly to Vs 

and depth values. These Vs and depth estimates were used to obtain velocity increase trend with 

depth (Fig 10.19). The velocity increase trend along with the velocity (Vs) at one-meter depth 

was input into Eq 8.12 and the depth of the bedrock at each sensor locations were estimated 

(Table 10.1). This sediment package thickness and velocity increase trend were used along with 

ellipticity curve for inversion and shear wave velocity profile retrieval (Fig 10.20). 

 

Fig.10.19 Shows the velocity increase trend via best-fit through shear wave velocity and depth which give value of 

          and x=0.45 (b here is x in other relation of chapter 7).

In Bebedouro area, ellipticity curves were obtained from each of the 6 sensors installed next to 

MASW profiles. The joint inversions were made for all these six locations. The results are 

shown in Fig 10.21- 10.23. The velocity increase trend was obtained from all the six dispersion 

curve direct inversions. This velocity increase trend was used along with ellipticity curve 

obtained for the 4 sensors where the dispersion curves were not available (Fig 10.24). The 

velocity increase trend was overlaid on the inversion result which shows a very good velocity 

increase trend match with lower misfit velocity profile (Fig 10.24).

10.5 The application of H/V curve for some new aspects 

Apart from the site resonance frequency, thickness, average shear wave velocity for soil package 

estimation and also 1D shear wave velocity profile from its inversion with dispersion curve, the  

H/V curve can be used for some other application as well. The shear wave velocity obtained 

from the MASW survey is considered as 1D Vs representative structure of the investigation site. 

As we showed in this study, the peak frequency of the H/V provides a very good approximation 

of the bedrock depth if the thickness-frequency relation for a locality is available. The dispersion 



 
 

151 
 

curve at IAG site has been used to estimate thickness-frequency relation and to evaluate whether 

the bedrock topography at the site is isotropic or there is some azimuth variation. We rotated the 

horizontal components of the seismic noise recording at     steps from    at North to       at 

South. The rotated horizontal components are divided by the vertical Fourier spectral amplitude. 

This rotated H/V curves are documented for this azimuth (Fig 10.25). The shift of peak 

frequencies with azimuth is used to estimate the thickness of soft sediment package for that 

azimuth from the thickness-frequency relation (Fig 10.26). 

 

Fig.10.25. Shows the shift of the peak frequency of H/V curves for rotating horizontal components for IAG site.

Fig.10.28 Shows the shift of peak frequency with the azimuth (left), while on the right shows the thickness of 

sediment package estimated from the peak frequency shift with azimuth (for IGC site). 

These analysis indicate that there is a upwelling of the bedrock topography within the subsurface 

along these azimuth range         . We tried to link this to the surface topography of the USP 
site (Fig 10.29). The increase of elevation and bedrock appearance toward the westward 

direction might be an indication of the bedrock topography continuation within the subsurface.

shows IAG site while two-headed arrow show IGC site. 

The second aspect that could be investigated by the simple H/V curve analysis is the dominancy 

of a higher mode of Rayleigh waves at a site. The dispersion curves of the six MASW profiles at 

the Bebedouro site are shown in the Fig 10.30. The dispersion images of these six profiles show 

higher mode appearance in Beb 16, Beb 4a, Beb 11 and Beb 7 (Fig 10.30). The six H/V curves at 

these sites are shown in Fig (10.9). A link could be established between the shape of the H/V 

curve and higher mode dominancy in the dispersion images by this observation that, when there 

is one clear peak and trough and there is no such other peak comparable to the prominent peak of 

the H/V curve, the dispersion image shows the dispersion curve and most probably fundamental 

mode such as in Beb 4b in Fig (10.9). However, when there is either a flat or two peaks within 

the H/V curve, the dispersion image is dominated by higher mode Rayleigh waves. The similar 

observation were extended for the other two sites with two MASW profiles each one at IAG and 

IGC and two at Colônia site (Fig 10.31). The H/V curves of these sites (Fig 10.32) shows only 

one clear peak and trough while the dispersion images recorded at these sites shows only one 

prominent dispersion curve on the dispersion image. Though this observation was verified at 10 

sites, we still believe that this behaviour of H/V need more detailed analysis to conclude it in 

detail. However, the results from these sites dispersion images and the H/V curves shape 

comparison shows that if the H/V curve shape shows a single peak and trough with no flat or 

second comparable peak, the site characteristics do not allow the higher mode dominancy of 

Rayleigh waves.

Chapter 11: Conclusions 
 

The most important part of any study is to draw the conclusion. However, to draw the conclusion 

about an analyzed phenomenon might always need improvement and further testing. So here, it 

will be tried to note down only those phenomena which we have found by analyzing our 

theoretical and experimental data. 

The modelling of the H/V curve and its linkage with a physical phenomenon remained always 

the prime concern for all the study performed using the H/V spectral ratio curves. We have 

analyzed all the available and presented so far techniques for the modeling of the H/V curve and 

compared the result of each modelling technique with the experimental H/V curve measured at 

the borehole site. The technique which gives the best correlation with experimental data is the 

surface wave modelling of the H/V curve. However, the shape of H/V curve is mainly controlled 

by the Rayleigh ellipticity fundamental mode. The Nakamura and Diffused field assumption are 

excluded from the inversion analysis due to the results of some previous studies and also due to 

the deviation of the experimental curve from the model curve by these techniques for our site. 

The main advantage of the H/V curve techniques is that it provides the shear resonance 

frequency of the site. The technique provides an easy, cheap and fast method to obtain this 

fundamental resonance frequency. The type of waves around the peak of the H/V curve always 

remained the topic of discussion. Our analysis showed that the H/V curve peak provides a better 

representation of the shear wave resonance frequency because of all the elastic seismic waves 

contributed around the peak. The other technique of surface waves and Rayleigh waves 

dominancy shows better replication of fundamental resonance frequency but only for a higher 

Poisson ratio. Similarly, the deviations from the shear resonance frequencies were checked for 

the velocity contrast between the soil and bedrock. The H/V curve for the mostly used modelling 

techniques shows that peak frequency changes its behavior when the shear wave velocity 

contrast is 2.6. At the contrast velocity of the 3.6, the peak frequency deviation of the H/V curve 

from the shear resonance frequency is lesser. Similarly, the thickness of soil variations were 

checked for the peak frequency deviation from shear wave resonance frequency and it was found 

that when the shear wave contrast is 3.6 or higher the deviation from the shear wave resonance 

frequency is greatly reduced. The P wave contrast and density contrast show no effect on the 

peak frequency deviation of the H/V curve.   

The shape of the H/V curve was checked with the three main techniques and it was found that 

the shape of the H/V curve is mainly dominated by the fundamental mode of the Rayleigh wave 

ellipticity curve. Also the shape deviation of the H/V curve from the one layer model was 

analyzed for different number of contrasting interfaces (layers) within the subsurface. It gives a 



 
 

157 
 

dubious and unclear result, however, the shape deviation for the H/V curve was found to be 

sensitive to a maximum number of 6 layers within the subsurface. 

The peak frequency of the H/V curve provides a good idea about the thickness of the soft 

sediment packages if the shear wave velocity information at the near surface is known. The peak 

of the H/V curve is strongly depended on the ratio between the thickness of the soil to the shear 

wave velocity (average shear wave travel time). The same average travel time gives an 

analogous peak. The peak and thickness relation is mostly utilized for a larger area to get quickly 

the idea of the soft sediment thickness from the H/V curve peak. We have compared the results 

of experimental H/V curve peak frequency relations for the Bebedouro area with two equations 

obtained mathematically.  These two equations showed very close results to one another. We 

demonstrated that the dispersion curve can be directly inverted to shear and depth values in 

which will result in the velocity at one-meter depth and the shear wave velocity increase trend 

with depth upon regression analysis. These two values can be used to obtain the thickness-

frequency relation and also, these values can be used for the ellipticity curve alone inversion to 

obtain the subsurface 1D shear wave velocity profile. 

The part of ellipticity which carries the most important information about the subsurface was 

also checked. The only part of the ellipticity which it changes its shape with the subsurface 

velocity contrast is the right limb of the ellipticity curve. The dispersion and ellipticity curves 

have different sensitivities to the different layer parameters. The inversion of each of the target 

curves alone (dispersion and ellipticity curve) provides a trade-off between shear wave velocity 

and soft sediment thickness. To invert the ellipticity curve alone, some supplementary 

information was required. We analyzed the different parts of the ellipticity curve inversion with 

velocity increase trend information. We found that right limb of the ellipticity curve provides a 

better result of the inversion. However, as the peak frequency contains information regarding to 

the depth of the contrasting interface between soft sediment and seismic bedrock cover, the left 

limb of the ellipticity curve was also included in the inversion to constrained the sediments 

thickness. The misfit function was analyzed for both the targets (dispersion and ellipticity curve) 

to weight properly both of the target during the inversion. We had defined a new strategy to 

weight both the targets and had shown that it provides a better result for the theoretical case. 

Unfortunately, it did not provide a better result for the experimental data inversion. It might need 

some more terms (conditions) to be included which will be analyzed in a future work. To 

improve the result of joint of inversion, we have adopted trial and error procedure by adjusting 

the weight of one target at the expense of the other. 

Lessons were learned from the theoretical analysis tested on data of the three sites, where the 

dispersion and seismic ambient noise recording were made. It has been extensively observed that 

H/V curves always contain the effects of Love and body waves, especially around the peak, but 

the Love wave effect extends for the whole frequency range. This contamination drives the shape 

of the H/V curve to deviates from the Rayleigh ellipticity curve. Two techniques were tested to 

remove the effect of Love waves from the horizontal component of noise wavefield and make 



 
 

158 
 

the shape of the H/V curve closer and true representative of the fundamental mode of Rayleigh 

wave ellipticity. The methods were tested for a theoretical curve by comparing with an 

experimental curve at the borehole site (USP area). The result of joint inversion of ellipticity and 

dispersion curves at a borehole site was compared with direct measurements which gave a very 

good correlation. Similarly, the joint inversion result was made for the other areas too. The 

velocity increase trend at the Bebedouro and Colônia areas were used along with ellipticity 

curves to obtain the shear wave velocity profiles. 

The H/V curve was checked for the peak frequency variation with azimuth. If the peak frequency 

is varying, we can infer that soil thickness is also varying with azimuth.  

The shape of the H/V curve was checked with dispersion curve for ten different acquisition 

points, which showed that when the H/V curve has one peak and the dispersion curve shows 

trough a single dispersion curve, it is most probably the fundamental mode. However, when 

there were two or a flat peak, the H/V dispersion image at the same site showed higher mode 

appearance and existence. 

The future work includes some more detail insights of the H/V curve variation with azimuth and 

its linkage with site geological setting. This could be potentially utilized in the area of land 

sliding to identify the direction of maximum slope. The shape of the H/V curve linkage with 

Rayleigh waves fundamental and higher modes dominancy needs further testing too. Three 

component sensors array analysis (SPAC) is under consideration to find out the fraction of Love 

wave contribution to horizontal component of noise wavefield. If this fraction is somehow find 

out with time and site variability, this will help to simply reduce the effect of Love by dividing 

the H/V spectral ratio with that factor and ready to go for inversion with dispersion curve. The 

misfit function are desired to be modified to give better result for experimental curves joint 

inversion.

Index A : The forward computation procedure of the ellipticity curve  (courtesy to Piccozi, 2005) 

 

As we discussed in chapter 6, Thomson-Haskell propagator matrix is used for solving the eigenvalue-

eigenfunctions problem for horizontal stacks of n-layers, which help us to determine the dispersion and 

ellipticity curve. Considering a special situation of equation 6.18 

 

                                           A1 

 

where f is a column vector of n components ( 2 for Love waves, and 4 for Rayleigh waves) that gives the 

depth dependence of particle displacement and stress, and A is an nxn matrix that depends both on the 

elastic properties of the medium and by horizontal slowness p (p =1/v =k
n 
(k?)/? sec/m) and frequency ?. 

A for Love waves takes the form (Aki and Richards, 2002) 

 

A= 
       

              
                                                        A2 



 
 

174 
 

 

and similarly, A for Rayleigh waves takes the form 

 

 

A= 

 

 
 

  
                     

     
       

               

 ?                                             

                     ?                                 

 
 

         A3 

 

 

 

When A is independent of depth, which is valid inside the layer, then A1 solution can be written in the 

form as  

 

f(z) = G(z,z
o
) f(z

o
)                                                                                    A3 

 

where G(z,z
o
) is the same as equation 6.21 

 

                                               A4 

 

This equation A4 can be used to determined dispersion phase wave velocity curve and ellipticity curve. 

However, the boundary condition at infinite depth for both the Love and Rayleigh waves (Eq. 6.16 and 

6.17) cannot be solved directly. So, Aki and Richards (2002) proposed that it beings transforming it into a 

radiation condition that no up-going waves are found in the bottom of the half-space. Moreover, since its 

interesting to define the surface wave curves as a function of the desired V
S

. While the relation for Rayleigh 

waves has the form of 

 

 

  
  
  
  

     

  

  

  

  

               A6 

 

In this equation, the matrix F is factored as 

F=

and ? = ((?+2?)/?)

. 

 

The main advantage of using this formalization appears when the inversion of the relations l = Fw and r 

=Fw (w = F
-1 

l and w = F
-1 

r) are computed. Namely, the inverse, F
-1

, of  F (and also of each of the matrix 

factors in A7  can be easily evaluated).  

In the second step of this procedure, the Thomson-Haskell method were used to apply the relation w = F
-1 

l and w = F
-1 

r to the motion stress vector at the depth z = z
n
. Thus, the amplitudes of up going and down 

going waves in the half-space may be expressed in terms of the motion stress vectors at the depth z = z
o
. 

Similarly to the eq. (A4) they assume the form

Clearly, nontrivial solution l and r from the above equations can be obtained when B

in equation A10 

and the sub-determinant (B

– B

B
32

) in the A11 vanishes. 

In conclusion, the equations 

 

B
21 

= 0          A12 

 

 
      
      

           A13 

 

are the eigenvalues of the A10 and A11, respectively.  

As a result, for evaluating the dispersion curves it is sufficient to find, for each frequency, ?/2?, and in 

the correct order to clearly identify all modes, all the n roots k(n) of the equations (10 and 11). Moreover, 

it is clear that since the terms of the matrix B are related with the elastic parameters of the layers forming 

the medium, the dispersion curves reflect the mechanical structure of the medium itself. However, Dunkin 

(1965) stated that the terms B
ij 

of the sub-determinant (13) can become very large during the process of 

computation. Therefore, the result of their subtraction could not have significant digits enough or even 

becomes zero. As a result, this computational operation is not easy as it seems at a first glance, and if 

computers with high precision are not available, the phase velocity estimated could be severely biased. 

Some ways of solving that problem are either using the Laplace’s development by minors (Dunkin, 1965 

and Knopoff, 1964), or the layer-reduction method (Schwab and Knopoff, 1970), or the 

Orthonormalization method (Wang, 1999).  

From a practical point of view, for each frequency, ?/2?, the roots search is performed along the slowness 

axis, k, by an iterative procedure of trial k
i
. Hence, the parameters k

min 
and k

max
, associated to the V

Rmax 

and V
Rmin 

or the V
Lmax 

and V
Lmin

, are identified first. Then, the others roots in the range (k
min 

- k
max

) are 

generally obtained by means of some robust non-linear and non-analytical function, as the bracketing 

techniques combined with bisection proposed by Hisada (1995). We used a code which is based on the 

Dunkin's procedure of solving that problem. The reference for further documentation can be found on 

report number D14.07 of SESAME project (SESAME). 

After the terms of the matrix B (A11) are known, it is possible also to evaluate the ellipticity curves 

(r
1
(z

o
)/r

2
(z

o
)) for different modes of the Rayleigh waves. In fact, from the equation (A11) we can see that

and consequently, the ellipticity correspond to the relationship 

 

      

      
=-

   

   
            A15 

 

This ratio is an imaginary number and, when it is positive, the particle motion is prograde. Conversely, 

when it is negative, the motion is retrograde. Since, for each frequency, the terms B
ij 

reflect the elastic 

properties of the medium at a different depth and also by the ellipticity curve, the mechanical 

structure of the medium can be found.
