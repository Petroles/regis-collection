ABSTRACT 

 

ith the boom of mineral resources from the middle of the 21st century onwards, 

Mozambique has been targeted by countries seeking investment in the extractive 

industries sector. Internally, this subject has generated important debates among 

– but not exclusive to – political parties in the sense of greater regulation of the 

sector. This led to the formation of a coalition of key actors in Mozambican civil society (CS) 

leading to the advent of a CS platform for natural resources and extractive industries. However, in 

2012, the Mozambican government took an important step in preparing the sector for the upcoming 

transformations. It is in this sequence of events that, in the same year, the revision of mining and 

petroleum laws appeared, which led CS to appeal for the need for transparency in the sector. This 

was accompanied by advocacy campaigns by CS, particularly of the platform referred to above. 

Thus, this study intends to answer the following question: what is the typology (or nature) of the 

existing relationship between CS and the Government of Mozambique? The study favours a 

qualitative methodology based on a case study and self-completion interviews directed at actors in 

CS that were selected due to their relevant roles in the advocacy campaigns for the approval of the 

Mining and Petroleum Laws in 2014. The results demonstrated that the relations established mainly 

have components of complementarity, since this process was driven by different strategies of CS 

actors as well as the Government of Mozambique. This case study contributes to the literature on 

the relations between the state and civil society in hybrid regimes. Future studies will be important 

to verify the extent to which those results are found in other areas of Mozambican politics and what 

developments have occurred over time.

SUMMARY 

 

om o boom dos recursos minerais a partir de meados do século XXI Moçambique ficou 

na mira dos países que procuram investimentos no sector da Indústria Extrativa. 

Internamente esta questão gerou importantes debates entre os partidos políticos no 

sentido de uma maior regulação do setor mas não só. Tal facto induziu a formação de 

uma coligação de atores-chave da Sociedade Civil (SC) moçambicana levando ao surgimento de 

uma Plataforma da SC sobre Recursos Naturais e Indústria Extrativa. Todavia, em 2012, o Governo 

Moçambicano deu um passo importante ao preparar o setor para as transformações que se 

avizinhavam. É nesta sequência que, no mesmo ano, surgiu a Revisão das legislações de Minas e 

Petróleos, o que levou a SC a apelar para a necessidade de transparência do setor, que foram 

acompanhados por campanhas de advocacy por parte da SC, em especial, da Plataforma acima 

referida. Assim, o presente estudo pretende responder à seguinte questão: qual a tipologia (ou 

natureza) das relações existentes entre a SC e Governo de Moçambique? O estudo privilegia uma 

metodologia qualitativa, baseada num estudo de caso e em entrevistas por autopreenchimento 

dirigidas aos atores da SC que foram selecionados em função do papel relevante nas campanhas de 

advocacy para a aprovação da Lei de Minas e Lei dos Petróleos em 2014. Os resultados alcançados 

demonstram que as relações estabelecidas têm sobretudo componentes de complementaridade, uma 

vez que este processo foi conduzido por estratégias diferentes por parte da SC bem como do 

Governo de Moçambique. Este estudo de caso contribui para a literatura sobre as relações entre 

estado e sociedade civil em regimes híbridos. Estudos futuros serão importantes para verificar em 

que medida estes resultados se verificam noutras áreas da política moçambicana e que evoluções 

têm ocorrido ao longo do tempo.

CHAPTER 1 

 GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

 

ivil society (CS) is one of the oldest subjects of study in social and human sciences. 

Many authors have contributed to the deepening of methodological and theoretical 

issues about this concept, both in the European and American contexts and in the 

African context. The objective of this research is to understand the relationship 

between CS and the government in Mozambique. This is a relevant research topic more than a 

quarter of century since the signing of the General Peace Agreement, which hallmarked the two-

fold transition from war and one-partysm to peace and democracy. While recent events (namely 

the resurgence of armed conflict in 2012) suggest that the path towards peace and democracy is far 

from linear, there have been landmark political changes followed by a considerable growth of the 

number of organisations in Mozambican CS. This introductory chapter seeks to provide a general 

framework for the topic, which includes the initial questions, the research objectives and the 

structure outlined for the study.  

 

1.1 Introduction 

 

The study of CS in Africa has acquired new emphasis on the processes of political liberation 

initiated in the beginning of the 1990s, the last objective of which was the implementation of a 

formal democracy1. Among many others, the Ghanaian researcher Gyimah-Boadi (1996:118-119) 

was one of the authors who emphasised the most central role of CS in this conjuncture, contributing 

to the successful preparation of elections and the installation of governments and opening space 

for CS proliferation in this context. The studies by Bratton &amp;amp; Van de Walle (1997) and Kraus 

(2007) also corroborate this view, since they point to the importance of trade unions, professional 

associations, student groups, etc. in triggering the popular protests that led to political openness. 

                                                      
1 Gyimah-Boadi (1996) highlights the 1990s as the beginning of "formal democracy" and the period in which CS 

emerges in Africa under external influences, such as the fall of communism and pressure from the international 

community. Citizen’s dedication supports a process of transition by opening up new political directions, such as the 

preparation of elections and the installation of new governments, opening the door to new contours of democracy.

A minimalist definition of CS – proposed by CIVICUS – suggests that it is an "arena 

beyond family, state and the market where people associate to advance common interests" 

(Heinrich &amp;amp; Fioramonti 2008). However, there are several authors who point out that it is difficult 

to apply this conceptualisation in Africa. According to Dias (2011: 136-139), the existing 

understanding of who represents CS in Africa departs from this paradigm. The CS concept is 

variable according to specific contexts, and it may include unions, non-governmental organisations 

(NGOs), urban and modern associative movements, and civic organisations derived from religious 

institutions. In Chapter 2, we will return to this conceptual debate, as it is relevant to this study. 

In Mozambique, CS – namely through the Christian Council of Mozambique (CCM) and 

the Catholic Church (Van Den Bergh, 2009) – played a central role in the process of transition to 

peace and democracy. Furthermore, both the 1990 Constitutional Revision and the General Peace 

Agreement of 1992 contained provisions aimed at liberalising the performance of the parties and 

organisations of CS. 

According to article 78 of the CRM of 1990, "the participation of social organisations is 

seen as a fundamental element for the promotion of democracy", which is understood as a basis of 

guarantee for increasing the sense of collective ownership in government actions. Over the years, 

the official discourse has been favourable to the performance of CS, seeing its participation in the 

governance process as positive. For example, the government's five-year plan (2010-2014) points 

out that, for the consolidation of democracy, "the program governance should involve all interests 

and social forces, which guarantees them more opportunity to be accepted as legitimate, allowing 

them to be heard". 

Despite the transformations that have occurred since 1990 aiming at political liberalisation 

in Mozambique, the country is still considered a hybrid democracy where democratic institutions 

and authoritarian practices prevail (Morlino 2008, Sanches 2014, Sanches 2018). Although regular 

elections have existed since 1994, the results have translated into the systematic domination of 

FRELIMO, leading the opposition parties, notably RENAMO, to question the quality and integrity 

of the elections. Over time, no significant advances in the process of democratic consolidation have 

been made (Forquilha 2007: 76), and the resurgence of armed conflict in 2012 is also an expression 

of the fragility of democratisation processes in post-conflict contexts. 



 

 3 

It is within this setting of political hybridity that we try to understand the ways in which CS 

acts in the Mozambican context and, more specifically, what the nature of the relations between 

CS and government is. 

In the case of Mozambique, the notion of who represents CS is comprehensive and may 

include formal and informal urban, rural, academic, professional, and voluntary organisations. 

Organisations from different areas collaborate with each other by performing functions based on 

belief, investigation, knowledge, provision of services to community-based organisations, 

platforms, thematic networks, and movements and forums (Topsøe-Jensen et al., 2015). 

Nevertheless, recent studies have enriched the debate surrounding the performance of CS in 

Mozambique. Authors such as Homerin (2005), Francisco (2010), Brito (2012), Adalima &amp;amp; 

Nuvunga (2014), and Nipassa (2017) focused on the participation of CS and the new challenges of 

the Government of Mozambique in discussing issues related to the legitimacy, autonomy, and 

dependence of CS on governance. In his study, Nipassa (2017) somewhat raised the issues of 

pressure, lobbying, and advocacy on the part of different CS organisations, organisational 

platforms, and/or forums such as advocacy campaigns for government publication of policies on 

extractive industries. 

In 2007, networks of CS organisations focused on extractive industries emerged and started 

a campaign of lobbying in which they appealed for clarity in the approval of contracts for the 

exploitation of natural resources, leading the government to publish such mining exploration 

contracts in 2013. Consequently, the lobbying campaign contributed to the approval of the Mining 

Law of 2014 (Nipassa, 2017:7), revoking the Mining Law of 2002. 

Both the Mining Law and the Petroleum Law were approved as the last acts of the 

Mozambican President Armando Emílio Guebuza in an economic context in which, according to 

Topsøe-Jensen et al. (2015), Mozambique was opening up to foreign capital after discoveries of 

coal reserves in Tete in 2009 and natural gas in the Rovuma Basin (Cabo Delgado) in 2012, as well 

as the discovery of natural gas in the Basin of Rovuma (Cabo Delgado) in 2012 that attracted 

international investors. 

On one hand, there were persistent hotspots of instability in the country resulting from 

political tensions among the belligerent parties, so the laws were passed without consensus. The 

votes were counted with a total absence of RENAMO on the parliamentary bench (Notícias 

newspaper, 08/08/2014). On the other hand, according to Macuane, Buur &amp;amp; Monjane (2017), citing 



 

 4 

Mabanza (2013), the discovery of mineral resources may have intensified political instability in 

the country resulting from autocratic tendencies and state bureaucracy. 

In an article published in Export.gov on 17 June, 2017, the International Trade 

Administration (ITA) emphasised that extractive industries would be the sector that would 

contribute better to the prospects for Mozambique. 

These laws were intended to adjust the legal framework of the sector once the country 

opened to foreign capital after the discovery of one of the largest unexplored coal deposits in the 

world, Tete thermal coal in 2009, as well as discoveries of minerals such as gold and graphite, 

which would put the country at a great competitive advantage over mining prices in the regional 

context when compared to its neighbour, South Africa. 

In this context, the problem or the starting point that led to this decision making process 

and the definition of the proposed theme has to do with the lack of knowledge, or at least 

insufficient knowledge, of the implications of CS participation in governance in Mozambique in 

the recent past, as well as the impact of the various political decisions presented in the period 

between 2010 and 2014 on the Mining Law of 20/2014 and the Petroleum Law of 21/2014. 

Therefore, before the complexity of interpreting CS fields of action on the political 

decisions of the Government of Mozambique, it is relevant to develop an analysis of the influence 

of CS, trying to identify the political agenda of the government and to what extent it was or was 

not influenced, conditioned, diminished, or manipulated by CS. In this period of time, we will look 

particularly at the emergence and role of civic associations in Mozambique in the period between 

1975 and 2016, when the number of organisations evolved from 709 to 4079 (see Appendix A). 

We will also discuss the role played by the so-called (and new-born) CS from the analysis of the 

set of political decisions translated into legislation and which, framed in another production of a 

complementary nature, will constitute the corpus to be investigated. 

In short, we want to answer the question: what is the typology (or nature) of the relationship 

between CS and the Government of Mozambique? This general issue is examined in the context 

of two laws: the Mining Act and the Petroleum Law approved in 2014. In observing those laws, 

we were interested in understanding which mechanisms of action were/are used and if there is room 

for manoeuvre for key actors in CS to influence political decisions.

1.2 Objectives of the Study  

General: 

(I) To characterise the relationship between CS and the government in political decisions 

in Mozambique. 

(II) To understand the level of involvement of CS in political decisions in Mozambique. 

Specific: 

(I) To contextualise and to describe the birth of CS in Mozambique. 

(II) To identify and map the main actors of CS (referring to the case study). 

(III) To relate CS's actions regarding the political decisions implemented in Mozambique in 

the approval of the Mining and Petroleum Laws of 2014. 

 

1.3 Structure 

The dissertation is divided into five chapters: general introduction, theoretical framework, work 

methodology, contextualisation, and analysis and interpretation of the results. 

? Chapter 1 – Introduces the content of this research and enunciates the concept of CS adopted 

from the definition of CIVICUS. Here, the questions of research, objectives, and the structure 

of the research are presented.  

? Chapter 2 – Within the theoretical framework, we frame CS in four theoretical dimensions: in 

political theory, in the context of international relations, in social movements as a form of 

participation, and in governance, which is the theoretical area that has shown to be the most 

relevant for the research. 

? Chapter 3 – After selecting the field of analysis for the research, the methodology is then 

selected based on a case study using a qualitative method that involved documentary analysis 

and paper interviews in order to conduct the research. 

? Chapter 4 – We contextualise the research based on the literature review about the participation 

of CS in Mozambique in (4.1), participation of NGOs in Mozambique (4.2), involvement of 

Mozambican CS in the 2010–2014 mandate (4.3), extractive industries in Mozambique versus 

platforms and forums from 2010 to 2014 (4.4), and platforms of CS on natural resources and 

extractive industries versus the proposed Mining Law and Petroleum Law approved in 2014 

(4.5). 



 

 6 

? Chapter 5 – The analysis follows and the results are presented in two sub-chapters: the 

characterisation of CSOs and CS involvement in governance. 

? Chapter 6 – The conclusion and recommendations for future research.

CHAPTER 2  

 THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 

 

n this chapter, we analyse the different meanings and approaches in the study of CS. In 

this sense, in order to construct a conceptual framework that supports the model of the 

study, we start from the framework of CS in political theory, its approach in international 

relations theory, its approach to social movements as a form of participation, and finally, 

the concept of CS in governance. We will place more emphasis on this last approach, as it contains 

the main contributions that help us frame the CS role in governance processes in Mozambique. 

 

2.1 Civil Society in the Political Arena 

 

In the theories of Gramsci (1974) and Hirschman (1984), CS involves a set of individual or 

collective initiatives for the public good and is formed by a group of freely associated people, who 

can fit into the fabric of society, performing diverse actions in a participatory manner. It is from 

this notion that Bratton (1994) distinguishes that for the associated life to become institutionalised, 

it must be expressed in the form of an organisation where the organisational structure constitutes a 

gathering of citizens who come together because of identity or interest to pursue a common goal. 

For the author, this concept is to be considered when those people construct a different sphere of 

influence and even work "against the State". 

In the same vein, authors such as Azarya (1994) and Harbeson, Rothchild, &amp;amp; Chazan (1994) 

seek attention for a model of organisation in association form that can be connoted with an active 

CS, where the benefits of "public participation" help balance the power of the state over citizens. 

However, the authors acknowledge that not all associations can be considered to be part of CS, 

because of the precondition that these should not be formed or controlled by the state; otherwise, 

they would simply be agents of state hegemony and would weaken CS. 

In this context, Cohen &amp;amp; Arato (1994) associate "participation" with the model of 

democracy where, in order to classify or define a particular political class as democratic, the 

"periodicity of conduct of elections and respect for civil rights, regardless of type of public or 

private institutions existing in the State" should occur. Although the models of democracy are very 

variable, this model should be evaluated.

In a different way, the CS concept was shaped to serve the purpose of "Good Governance"2 

rather than a deeper understanding of social formations and the associations that represent both 

them and the state (Kasfir, 1998). In the same vein, many academics reflect on a "participatory 

democracy"3, which proposes ways for the government to be more dependent on the people, 

interconnecting the relationship between civil society vis-à-vis democracy. 

This thought was progressively refined by theoreticians like Tocqueville (2008), who 

considered the art of association as a fundamental principle of democracy. In the author’s view, the 

science of "associativism"4 is regarded as the mother of progress; in order for people to remain or 

to become civilised, they must develop or perfect the art of association in the same proportion as 

the equality of conditions. 

Therefore, looking at the nature of the debate and contemporary theories, democracy is seen 

as the only way for the government to respond to the needs of the majority by accepting the freedom 

of "public opinion", thwarting vicious cycles, promoting peace, and warranting citizens' rights, 

freedoms, and aspirations, thus contributing to the efficiency of governments (Ibrahim, 2015 apud 

Rubin, 2001). In this context, it is particularly relevant to discuss the perspective that embraces the 

notion of public opinion in the concept of democracy. According to Habermas (1996), "public 

opinion is converted into communicative strength and power within society". In the view of the 

author, the rise of CS translates opinions that reflect a modern logic and propels a levelling of 

formal public rights within a society. 

Therefore, we can verify a diversity of approaches described in political thought by 

Gramsci, Hirschman, Habermas, Bratton, Cohen &amp;amp; Arato, Kasfir, and Tocqueville. This is contrary 

to the various debates related to globalisation, where CS is thought to integrate the transnational 

perspective of relationships that are established between non-state actors in the field of 

                                                      
2 (Bovaird &amp;amp; Loffler, 2003) consider that "Good Governance" derives from the concept of public governance, which 

involves several ways in which stakeholders interact with one another when it comes to public policy. Thus, good 

governance would be the negotiation of all of the parties involved in a single problem, with the objective of improving 

the results of public policies. 

3 The participatory democracy is addressed in the sense of the possibility of including citizens in order to contribute to 

the various decision-making processes in a state. 

4 For theoreticians like Tocqueville (2008), the theory of "associativism" is a fundamental characteristic of democracy, 

since it includes the participation of people in a group that aims to achieve several common objectives, and associations 

are regarded as the cause of union and progress.

international relations (2.2), include new tendencies of social demands that are defended by lobby 

groups in order to promote social movements (2.3), and, finally, play a role in governance (2.4). 

 

2.2 Civil Society in the Area of International Relations 

 

As actors of international relations, Santos &amp;amp; Ferreira (2012) identify civil societies as "pressure 

forces"5 that make their effects felt by reinforcing the multilateral tendency derived from the 

articulation established between state and non-state actors. The authors identify a tendentially 

globalised CS, which is evidenced by the capacity of active participation of actors and transnational 

lobby forces from the individual to the most altered forms of collective organisation. 

The existence of a "global or transnational" CS6 addressed by Herz &amp;amp; Hoffman (2004) 

became the main contribution of the 21st century, contrary to the usual discourse that CS was an 

essential element of the process of democratisation or even the main source of solidarity and social 

integration (Cohen &amp;amp; Arato, 1994). Truyol &amp;amp; Serra (1993) characterised forces and lobby groups 

of "social, cultural, intellectual, economic, political, religious and ideological union", which 

identify CS as a set of spontaneous exchanges, personal contacts, and generators of phenomena 

between co-ordinated transnational relations. 

Rosenau (1997), Boulding (1991), Truyol &amp;amp; Serra (1993) also analyse transnational 

relations and CS. The authors argue that there is influence exercised by the "transnational 

interactions" that produce effects of alteration in the international behaviours of states. They admit 

that there is a phenomenon of progressive awareness of individuals and societies about certain 

subjects that transcend the geocultural context of their territorial expression and that affect 

everyday life. 

It is in this context that Santos &amp;amp; Ferreira (2012) point to the "State, sovereignty, 

territoriality and borders" as factors that must be put into question in the elaboration of consequent 

solutions to global problems. According to the authors, demographic issues such as migration, 

                                                      
5 Pressure forces were identified by Habermas (2006) in his studies as voluntary groupings that operated outside the 

sphere of the state that exerted a force capable of influencing the decisions of state power. 

6 Global or transnational civil society in the view of Herz &amp;amp; Hoffman (2004) constitutes the existence of groups, 

individuals, or even social classes whose characteristics and actions are supra-territorial and at a global level that 

interact and develop beyond the state.

refugees, hunger, education, basic sanitation, climate change, unequal distribution of wealth, 

environmental degradation, and transnational organised crime can deepen interdependencies. The 

authors look at the participation of CS in the governance process and affirm that the fundamental 

question is due to representativeness and legitimacy. Having a look at non-governmental 

organisations (NGOs) as CS actors, it is clear that they gain more power and goodwill to work 

together and influence government decisions  

It is in this way that it becomes relevant to address the actions of non-state actors such as 

CSOs and NGOs, which not only channel significant contributions in terms of the direct effects 

inherent to the functions performed, but also integrate themselves into decision-making areas such 

as governance. 

 

2.3 Social Movements (as a Form of Participation of CS) 

 

The theories of the classical model often consider groups that provoke political tensions and the 

discourses of leaders and followers who are positioned to change institutions in a radical way. 

These social movements were identified and modelled after the revolutionary movements that were 

once conceived as mass mobilisation disputes from an antagonistic state, where the aim of the 

"revolutionaries" was to replace an oppressive form of state power with one that was oriented to 

different goals (Alexander, 2006). These movements were associated with an idea of revolution 

that produced a distinct tactical orientation to the violence of power and, in turn, this collective 

action can be understood as a struggle for position. Della Porta (2005) considers social movements 

as organising networks and individuals with common values who mainly use unconventional forms 

of political "participation" to achieve their political goals. However, the author points to a current 

contradiction of these movements in relation to the balance of participation and representation, 

highlighting the "traditional social movement" as an example. Without resources, it places 

confidence in the voluntary work of its members, where participatory models of democracy play 

an important role in market governance and liberalisation, and thus taking social justice and 

participatory democracy into consideration. 

Della Porta (2005), citing Bohman (1997), further points out that deliberative democracy, 

in theory, is a purpose that occurs among individuals able to develop capacities that give them 



 

 11 

access to the "public sphere"7. Once in public, they should be given enough respect and knowledge 

in order to be able to influence decisions. Here, the participation of individuals is also considered 

positive in terms of specific contribution to knowledge construction. The public sphere embraces 

several diversities. For Castells (2008), it constitutes an inseparable field of two fundamental 

dimensions in modern societies, among which is "Civil Society and State". It not only includes 

"media" and spaces of public interaction, but also can be seen as a cultural repository of ideas and 

projects that fuel public debate. It is through the public sphere that CS conflicts with this public 

debate and, ultimately, influences the decisions of the state, thus establishing an interaction 

between the CS and the state. 

 

2.4 Civil Society and Governance 

 

The increase of non-state actors in the provision of public services leads us to think about the 

dichotomy of governance and civil society or even about the relationship between the 

predominance of one and concept of the other. It is for this reason that we find it pertinent within 

the theoretical framework, which fits within the field of analysis of the present study, to finally 

bring the role of CS in governance into the discussion, which may help lead to a better conceptual 

perception and better choice of the ideal model for the present case study. 

Regarding the CS and governance subject, authors such as Tandon &amp;amp; Mohanty (2000) point 

to factors that led to greater disenchantment of people vis-à-vis government institutions, such as 

the rapid decrease in the capacity of certain institutions to respond to diverse interests and 

expectations of the population, the growing gap in government policies and their practical 

elaboration, the growing distance and alienation of the poor and marginalised from elite-dominated 

government institutions, and the persistence of problems of poverty, exclusion, and marginalisation 

in many countries of the world. 

It is in this context that Bevir (2010) maintains that the notion of governance is considered 

as government process being carried out as an organisation in formal or informal territory through 

                                                      
7 For Kaene (1998), public sphere is a concept that is intended as a spatial relationship between two or more people 

connected by a communication link. The author mentions the relationship between power, which operates with a 

particular kind of interaction, and debates in public circles. The author identifies societies as being composed of public 

spheres of different levels according to the problems and circumstances of the moment. 



 

 12 

laws, norms, power, or language. In this author’s view, this notion differs from the government 

itself, which focuses on actions and not on the state and its institutions. Thus, social organisations 

become much more involved in the practice of social activities and state supervision. 

The World Bank was the institution that most popularised the notion of governance 

(Tandon &amp;amp; Mohanty, 2000). Authors such as Williams &amp;amp; Young (1994) point to the involvement 

of CS as voluntary organisations and NGOs as institutions that participate as intermediaries 

between the government and the people in the governance processes in order to build a pluralistic 

structure. In the authors’ view, CS's role in governance is linked to the promotion of responsibility, 

legitimacy, transparency, and participation. 

For Bevir (2010), responsibility is addressed in a context of hierarchical relations, service 

delivery based on transparency, facilities, and incentive structures for "Good Governance", which 

is incorporated into the discourse on development, according to Ghaus-Pasha (2004). The author 

argues that without an appropriate governance structure, developing countries will not be able to 

sustain economic growth. In other words, they will not be able to have a rapid reduction of poverty. 

The existence of a responsible CS could contribute to promoting democracy and 

encouraging good governance. Thus, not only governments but also civil societies are required to 

practice transparency through the publication of reports, comments, clear procedures, and conduct 

of actions by decision-makers, because it will only be accessible to citizens in this way (Rondinelli 

&amp;amp; Cheema, 2003). According to Weiss (2000), in governance processes, governments continue to 

be the main agents in the provision of public goods, despite the growing involvement of non-state 

actors such as CS, voluntary agencies, NGOs, and corporate agencies in solving social problems. 

This growing involvement of non-state actors leads us to question the approach of authors 

such as Coston (1998), who classified the relationship between CS, in this case "NGOs", and 

government based on different dimensions such as resistance to the government or the acceptance 

of institutional pluralism, the relative balance of power in the relationship, and the degree of 

formality and, by extension, the level of nongovernmental linkage. According to Coston (1998), in 

the governance process, the relationship between CS and government depends on the 

circumstances, although, for the author, it seems inevitable that governments will increasingly 

accept institutional pluralism. Thus, the type of relationship will depend on the government and 

the willingness of NGOs to engage in formal relations. 



 

 13 

In his study, Najam (2000) also adopted the definition of NGOs as being a vast network of 

"non-profit, voluntary, charitable organizations, associates who are wholly or largely independent 

of the Government". According to the author, it is on the basis of this concept that NGOs are 

considered to have an "interest in public policies". Najam (2000) proposes a 4Cs analysis of the 

relationship between the government and the tertiary sector8 (in this case, NGOs) based on the 

objectives (or purposes) of "NGO-Government" institutions and their strategies for (or means of) 

achieving a particular goal. It is this model of analysis that we will use to frame our research, given 

its similarity in the selection of the chosen institutions (NGOs and government). 

According to Najam (2000), the 4Cs model presupposes that in the governance process, as 

CS organisations participate in the elaboration of certain government policies, there may be 

"Cooperation, Confrontation, Complementarity or Co-optation". These occur in certain 

combinations, such as: (i) co-operation – when the government and the organisation seek objectives 

and use similar strategies, (ii) confrontation – when they seek different goals and use different 

strategies, (iii) complementarity – when they pursue similar goals, but the strategies are different, 

and (iv) co-optation – when they opt for similar strategies but for different purposes. Thus, the 4Cs 

model proposed by the author is summarised in Fig 2.4.1 below. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 2.4.1: The 4Cs of NGO-Government Relations (Najam, 2000: 384) 

 

Using this perspective, we will consider fundamental elements of the relationship between CS and 

the government in terms of regimes of hybrid character for the case study. In regimes where 

                                                      
8 The tertiary sector incorporates civil society as an integral part of the system, which operates for the good of the 

public and the provision of social services at local and international level (Evers &amp;amp; Laville, 2004).

authoritarian practices prevail, there are greater obstacles for CS's performance, since governments 

can block CS's participation, weaken its autonomy with highly restrictive legislation, and even co-

opt organisations through vertical relationships and patronage (Kew &amp;amp; Oshikoya, 2014). As 

Mazepus (2012: 8) emphasises, CS can play a fundamental role in regime change or in the 

support/maintenance of it. Citing Migdal (2001), Mazepus (2012: 8) also considers that relations 

between CS and the state are "dynamic" and can often vary through new alliances and new laws. 

Thus, these relationships are always shaped by changes in the social, political, and economic needs 

of citizens. 

If we focus on the 4Cs model applied by Najam (2000) and look at the nature of the regime 

in Mozambique, we find fewer elements of a co-operation relationship between CS and 

government. In this sense, we consider that the relationship between CS and government is 

mediated by the characteristics of the regime.

CHAPTER 3  

 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 

 

ased on the theoretical model that analyses the role of CS in governance, we present 

the methodology of the study in this chapter. As a starting point, it uses the 

understanding of the various forms of participation of CS within a collective that were 

enunciated in the previous chapter and that are summarised in the figure below. The 

field of analysis that is observed in figure 3.1 represents the fundamental object of the research. To 

analyse the existent or non-existent influence of CS in governance, we have selected CS actors – 

in this case NGOs, CSOs and social movements – that acted individually in the campaigns for the 

Mining and Petroleum Laws that were approved in 2014 and that have joined the Platform on 

Mineral Resources and Extractive Industries. 

 

Figure 3.1.1: Civil society organisations (CSOs), social movements (MS), non-governmental 

organisations (NGOs), and government Source: Author’s own elaboration.  

 

3.1 Methods and data  

 

This research is based on a case study. According to Thomas (2011: 513-514), a case study 

concerns the analysis of people, decisions, political projects, institutions, or other systemic forms 

that are holistically studied through one or more methods. In a more precise definition, case studies 

concern "intensive research using the qualitative or quantitative method in one or multiple cases, 

where the researcher's goal is to understand a larger dimension of similar cases" (Seawright and 

Gerring, 2008: 296). When selecting the case, the objective is to explore a phenomenon intensively, 

trying to verify to what extent certain theoretical and empirical postulates are fulfilled or not 

fulfilled. Hence, many case studies allow us to generate interesting hypotheses for future research.

 16 

In the course of this investigation, we try to cross-reference various types of data, including 

collecting concrete experiences through testimonies given by CS organisations. The 

bibliographical research sought to contextualise the areas of discussion of the CS concept and its 

application to the African and Mozambican context, particularly highlighting its involvement in 

the third wave of democratisation9. In addition to being a qualitative work, we used other strategies 

to collect and analyse data, namely document analysis and self-completion interviews. 

 

3.2 Documentary Analysis 

 

This process consisted of the perusal of various documents, namely newspapers, decrees, laws, and 

papers produced by governmental and non-governmental institutions inside and outside of 

Mozambique. This phase of the research involved the queries of some web pages as sources : 

http://www.dw.com/pt-002/ongs-querem-participar-da-gestão-de-recursos-naturais-em-

moçambique/a-6556470, accessed on 18 November 2017. 

Since we intended to study CS's scope in Mozambique, this site made it possible to access 

news stories that explained of the creation of a platform of CS that emerged with the objective of 

promoting transparency and improvement in the government management of the natural resources 

and extractive industries. In the next phase, we accessed the papers published by the Public 

Integrity Centre (CIP) through the site: https://cipmoz.org/index.php/pt/industria-extractiva/507-

revisao-da-lei-do-petroleo-nao-ha-consulta-publica-nao-ha-transparencia.  

In this study, the emphasis was on documentary analysis. The published information 

revealed the lack of public consultation and transparency on the part of the Mozambican authorities 

after the publication of the revision of the Petroleum Law in the government portal in 2013. In the 

next phase, we accessed the consultation of the legislation published in the government portal: 

http://www.mireme.gov.mz/index.php?option=com_phocadownload&amp;amp;view=category&amp;amp;id=5:lei&amp;amp;

Itemid=150. On this website, it was possible to access the legislation on the Mining Law and the 

Petroleum Law, which were approved by the Assembly of the Republic of Mozambique in 2014 

and which will be duly dealt with in the chapter on analysis and interpretation of the results of this 

research.  

                                                      
9 In addressing the party systems in the African context, Sanches (2010), citing Bogaards (2004), states that the third 
wave of democratisation is characterised by the introduction of competitive multiparty elections that result from the 

predominance of historical parties.

The procedure for this method of gathering information seemed to be the most appropriate, 

since it allowed the selection of contents about extractive industries in Mozambique, the Mining 

Law and Petroleum Law, and CS organisations that participated in advocacy campaigns and lobby 

campaigns directed at the legislation under a study approved in 2014. The use of this technique 

proved to be relevant, since it allowed the selection of the case study. 

 

3.3 (Self-completion) Interviews 

 

In order to respond to the proposed research objectives, it was essential to gather the views and 

perceptions of CS's key actors. These were selected based on the relevant roles they played in the 

advocacy campaigns of the Mining and Petroleum Laws approved in 2014. 

These actors participated in civic actions as organised groups of CS in a platform network 

on mineral resources and extractive industries. The following organisations are included in the list 

of actors: Public Integrity Center (CIP), Terra Viva Center (CTV), World Wildlife Fund for Nature 

(WWF), National Association of Rural Extension (AENA), Cabo Delgado Environmental 

Association (AMA), and Association for Legal Assistance and Assistance to Communities 

(AAAJC). The Action Program for Inclusive and Responsible Governance (AGIR) and the Women 

and Law Organization in Southern Africa-Mozambique (WLSA) are not part of the Platform on 

Mineral Resources and Extractive Industries but participated as independent organisations in the 

approval of the Mining Law and Petroleum Law in 2014. 

Initially, the request for interviews was made to all organisations, and the goal was to 

conduct interviews via Skype. However, because of technical difficulties, none of the organisations 

were willing to respond and instead chose to fill out a questionnaire. The interview script (see 

Appendix C) in Table I and Table II contained questions regarding the analytical dimensions to be 

explored and analysed, namely the characterisation of selected CSOs for the case study, main areas 

of intervention of the same organisations, participation in governance processes (in the case of the 

Mining and Petroleum Laws), the mechanisms used by these CSOs in governance processes in 

Mozambique, and the level of government receptivity in CS interventions in governance processes.

3.4 Research Limitations 

 

The first obvious limitation was the difficulty of accessing information published by the Assembly 

of the Republic of Mozambique, the legislative body that approved these Laws in 2014. In this 

legislative body, it was only possible to access the reports on the Parliamentary Committee on 

Constitutional Affairs, Human Rights and Legality from 2014, as well as the report on the 

Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture, Economy and Environment from the year that the laws 

were approved. Hence, there was a need to analyse the relationship between CS and government. 

Therefore, we turned to the platforms and forums of CS on natural resources and extractive 

industries involved in the advocacy campaign in the draft of the Mining and Petroleum Laws in 

order to be able to hear their views on the subject. 

Another limitation on the evident information collection was the shortage of primary 

sources, namely documents that portrayed the involvement and participation of CS in the design 

of the Mining and Petroleum Laws. 

The third limitation was a lack of direct contact with former or current cabinet members, in 

order to provide statements about the approval process of the laws approved in 2014. Having 

cabinet members’ perspective would have been ideal to level the analysis, but unfortunately our 

contacts did not produce a successful outcome. In an effort to bridge this gap we consulted several 

online newspapers to try and find statements regarding the aforementioned laws10.

CHAPTER 4 

 CIVIL SOCIETY IN MOZAMBIQUE: A CONTEXTUALISATION 

 

his chapter, provides a general overview of the Mozambican civil society. It focuses 

on the evolution of CS looking at NGOs participation, social movements and at the 

networks of platforms and forums of CS involved in proposing the Mining and 

Petroleum Laws approved in 2014. 

 

4.1 CS in the Mozambican Context 

The chains of thought of Bayart (1986) and Chabal (1986) amplify the need to understand CS in 

Africa. 

“… Although we may discuss that the concept of CS does not apply outside of European history, I 

will provisionally define it as the society in relation with the State, to the degree in which it is 

confronting the state or, more accurately, as the process through which society attempts to ‘violate’ 

or neutralize the simultaneous ‘totalisation’ unleased by the State. The notion of CS is, therefore, an 

ambivalent (and not only conflicting) concept…” (Bayart, 1986:111). 

 

 “… Without doubt, the ideal liberal democracy, if it were possible, would be a great improvement 

over that which exists in the majority of African countries in their governments. But it is not exactly 

possible, because liberal democracy was the historic result of particular circumstances in which 

capitalism moulded the relation between State and Civil Society in Western Europe. The ideal 

Government in Africa today would be something different and whatever that would be, could only 

be conceived in terms of a historic analysis relevant to the relation between State and CS. Although 

there may be disagreement between the meaning of Civil Society in Africa…” (Chabal, 1986:14). 

 

The authors cited above made the need to understand the notion of CS in southern societies clear,11 

although in some arguments they have made it clear that there are areas of uncertainty about the 

                                                      
11 Southern societies rise in the context of international relationships to designate the current social and economic 

connections in place of the previous divisions of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd world countries.  In the opinion of Sorj (2005), the 

world should accept the fact that there are contradictions as much in the perception as in the interests of CS (NGOs) 

from the south and the north in each national society. 

T 



 

 20 

understanding of CS in Africa in the context of understanding democracy in relation to the state. It 

is therefore relevant to review the history of this concept on the African continent. 

In the case of Mozambique, the focus of our study, the magnitude of literature about CS is 

associated with the ideals of pan-Africanists and the struggle against the regimes in force during 

the colonial period, which inspired the preparation of some Mozambican leaders in the formation 

of the new state (Francisco, 2010:51). 

This situation allowed for the implementation of a single party system that put FRELIMO 

(the fruit of the merger between three nationalist regional movements, UDENAMO, MANU, and 

UNAMI) as the “only and legitimate representative of the Mozambican People” (Brito, 2009: 6). 

The limitation of participation by CS in this phase of Mozambican history was considered by 

Francisco et al., (2007:22), Brito (2009), and Francisco (2010:52) as being weak, given the political 

hegemony of the state as a party. Since then, associative life continued to observe different 

dynamics. In the 1980s, humanitarian organisation appeared, according Francisco (2010), as a 

consequence of the occurrence of natural causes like drought, hunger, and worsening economic 

conditions. 

After the end of the civil war, the participation of CS in the country was highlighted as an 

urban phenomenon in the space nearest to the implementation of the republic. In this period, not 

only did the regime change to a multiparty system, but also the armed conflict was resolved and 

the pacification of the country in the short and long terms occurred (Sanches, 2014:63). 

In the heat of a new situation inaugurated by the arrival of peace, Mozambique, a belligerent 

state in conflict (1976-1992), opened its doors to a new political reality marked by the participation 

of people associated in a different manner (Van den Bergh, 2011)12. The author highlighted the 

involvement of the CCM and Catholic Church that marked a new scenario in the peace and 

reconciliation process of the country. Neves (2009) affirms that this period witnessed the organised 

capacity of men and women, which extended itself to a new state. This movement was highlighted 

                                                      
12 Lucia Van Den Bergh, a previous representative of the Association of European Parliaments for Africa (AWEPA), 

on the new dynamics of some social organisations in the country. In her book, the author sets out frank and honest 

conversations with more than 50 people who took part in the peace, democracy, and political stability processes in 

Mozambique, namely politicians, deputies, people that conducted the elections, and finally community and CS 

organisations. 



 

 21 

for allowing a recognition of men and women as social actors that showed their motivations for 

and defence of common causes. 

It is within this conjecture that Gyimah-Boadi (1996), discussing CSOs including Christian 

associations, considered that these were and/or are a strong contribution for the democratisation of 

African countries. For the author, the renovation of and the interest for democracy gave impulse to 

CS as actors and forces to pressure political reforms on the continent after 1994, as was the case of 

NGOs. In the context of Mozambican politics, since the first multiparty elections of 1994 – as well 

as subsequent elections held in 1999, 2004, 2009, and 2014 – the results always translated into a 

victory for the FRELIMO party and RENAMO as the principal force of opposition. In 2009, a third 

party appeared in the political context that interfered with the bipolar scenario dominated by 

FRELIMO and RENAMO: the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which managed 

to elect deputies (Sanches, 2014:48-53). 

In 2012, 20 years after the signing of the General Peace Agreement and with the rising 

opposition of RENAMO, several incidences of violence linked to the discovery of mineral 

resources and the imminent signing of the contract for liquid petroleum gas (LPG) were recorded. 

In this sequence of events, a ceasefire allowed for a dialogue between these party forces – 

FRELIMO and RENAMO – which was mediated by an international team, and RENAMO 

demanded the nomination of provincial governors in the provinces rich in resources, where it 

claimed to have won a majority in the national elections of 2009 (Macuane, Buur &amp;amp; Monjane, 

2017). 

According to Sanches (2014), the 2014 elections were held in the country in a particularly 

difficult context that revealed the weaknesses of the peace process and the democratisation of 

Mozambique. 

 

4.2 Participation of NGO’s in the Governance of Mozambique 

 

The network of NGOs in Mozambique came about in the context of humanitarian assistance in the 

1980s. After that, the statute of national NGOs was approved in 1991 in the ambit of the multiparty 

Constitution of 1990 (Homerin, 2005). 

In many African countries soon after the political transition in the beginning of the 1990s, 

the relationships between the state and civil society changed to a more collaborative focus aimed 



 

 22 

at development. According to Homerin (2005), in Mozambique, CS organisations such as NGOs 

and economic associations performed an important role in the state by creating partnerships, 

especially in the areas of developing infrastructures and poverty reduction policies. NGOs are 

considered important actors of CS in Mozambique because they contribute to the consolidation and 

capacitation of government actors with a view of strengthening joint actions and strengthening 

partnerships for development (Macuane et al., 2012). The nature of these organisations combines 

activities that provide basic services with the promotion of citizenship. Taking into consideration 

the fiscal challenges that NGOs face, Macuane et al., (2012) show that partnership with the 

“government” is of extreme importance for the provision of services. 

In this sense, in the Government of Mozambique’s (PQG) 2010–2014 five-year plan, the 

Mozambican government affirms that democracy imposes a respect for “political plurality” and for 

diverse “forms of participation” of the people in making decisions about matters of national 

interest. 

 

4.3 Involvement of Mozambican CS from 2010 to 2014 

 

If we look at CS organisations as fundamental actors within a society, they become more active in 

influencing government decisions and acting in concert (Francisco, 2010). The author considers 

that the basic question to be considered in the process of governing should be the representability 

and legitimacy of CSOs. 

In the PQG (2010–2014) objectives defined by the government were set out with strict 

collaboration with CS about political formations, religious confessions, the academic community, 

and all of the social actors, working to build a just and democratic society that is united and has the 

utmost tolerance for the following priority actions: 

(i) To reinforce the participation of CS in local development with special attention to 

consolidation of local consultative councils. 

(ii) To promote partnerships with the organisations of CS to teach citizenship. 

(iii)  To reinforce the functioning of consultative local counsels to ensure popular participation, 

the development of communities, and CS’s activity in government. 

(iv)  To develop programmes that would assure the connection between literacy and informal 

educational programmes, in partnership with CS. 



 

 23 

(v) To establish the mechanisms for permanent dialogue and the institutional co-ordination 

with CS within the ambit of women and social action. 

(vi) To strengthen the participation of CS to monitor government action in order to combat 

corruption by means of the capacitation of development observatories and district consulting 

councils. 

(vii) To ensure respect for human rights by means of sensitisation and divulgation actions, 

involving other actors/authors of CS in addition to state institutions. 

(viii) To make cross interventions from base structures, to consolidate public-private 

partnerships, and to work with CSOs, empowering these organisations for challenges that they 

may face as they rise and permanently monitoring the evolution of efficiency of responses. 

For Francisco (2007), CS could be considered an influencing factor for policies that are 

conducive to achieving good governance. On the side of the government, CS contributes to the 

development of a democratic state by means of concrete actions and the mobilisation of resources. 

If we look at the emergence of the CS concept in the Mozambican context, we can confirm the 

existence of various concessions for classification. Notions such as associative movements, non-

governmental organisations, and religious associations apply to this concept. 

These recent transformations in Mozambican society resulted in the citizens developing a 

conscience about their roles in the governing process, according to Brito (2014). The author states 

that it is in this way that the uprisings of 2010 and the “protests” of 2013 contributed to participation 

of CS in the monitoring of the government and pressuring the responsible government parties to 

be accountable to society for the decisions made and the way in which they managed public funds 

(see Appendix B – the table highlights the cases in which the actions of CS resulted in legislative 

changes in Mozambique). 

During the period of 2008 to 2014, Mozambique witnessed (i) social protests resulting from 

increased living costs, namely for transport, basic products such as bread, electricity, and water, 

which marked the first sign of social and urban discontent about the government at the time (Revolt 

against Hunger) (Brito et al., 2015), and (ii) campaigns objecting to the ProSavana programme that 

involved CSOs from Mozambique, Brazil, and Japan (“No to ProSavana” campaign; DW, 2014). 

Revolt against Hunger (2008/2013) – with the biggest concentration of protests in the cities 

of Maputo and Matola – were protests organised by popular groups on a micro scale and replicated 

afterwards in other cities in the country. According to Brito et al. (2015), the mobilisations of these 



 

 24 

protests took place by means of messages that circulated virally on mobile telephone networks and 

other means of communication, which resulted in the government finding it difficult to control the 

nature of the protests. The message of the protesters was about the increased cost of living and the 

relationship between citizens and the state. 

The absence of concrete means of communication made it very difficult to investigate who 

was really behind these protests. Reflecting on the protagonists of the protests, Bussoti (2010) 

raises the first hypothesis that it dealt with a truly spontaneous protest. In fact, this hypothesis 

presents itself as a result of a vacuum in civil society, because the youth involved would not have 

had the capacity to organise popular movements on such a significant and violent scale within the 

country. In the second hypothesis, the author raises the possibility of an “invisible hand”, or even 

planning through organising entities such as unions and opposition parties. 

The campaign, No to ProSavana (2012-2015), was a reaction to the ProSavana programme, 

which is a tripartite co-operation programme for agricultural development of the tropical savannah 

in Mozambique. It started in 2011 with resources from the Brazilian Cooperation Agency (BCA), 

Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Institutes of Agrarian Investigation of 

Mozambique (IAIM) (Fingermann, 2013). 

The project includes the principles of “South-South Cooperation”13 held by the Brazilian 

government at the time, which was led by former Brazilian president Lula da Silva. In his empirical 

study, Fingermann (2013) refers to the campaign, No to ProSavana, and included organisations 

seen in the provinces of Niassa, Nampula, and Zambezia (in the centre and north of the country) 

that protested against the implementation of the programme. It is in this way that, based on excerpts 

of a conversation with members of the National Union of Peasants in Niassa, DW (2014) confirms 

that “secrecy, omission, manipulation, criminalisation, deliberate disturbance of peace of 

contradicting documents as well as the manipulation of leaders of peasant organisations” were the 

source of the protests on behalf of CS. 

The CS groups developed from a role of merely holding the government accountable to one 

of being active participants in research and advocacy (Francisco et al., 2007), contributing to 

greater pressure over the state and international institutions, which in turn contributed to improving 

politics within Mozambican society. It is within this guiding spirit of research that we endeavour 

                                                      
13 South-South Cooperation is based on the horizontal relationship between developing countries looking to find new 

ways to cooperate on values and premises that would draw them away from the new paradigm of globalisation and 

development (Bueno, Faria &amp;amp; Bermudez., 2013). 



 

 25 

to explore this evolution of CS organisations, specifically those that are associated in a joint fashion 

and represented through platforms and forums, and even more specifically those that were involved 

in drafting the Mining Law 20/2014 and the Petroleum Law 21/2014. 

 

4.4 Extractive Industries in Mozambique versus Platforms and Forums (2010-2014) 

 

In the literature on extractive industries in Mozambique, there are at least two perspectives to keep 

in mind: on the one hand, that of Mussagy (2015), which puts forward the fact that the capacity for 

foreign investment and the exploitation of natural resources must be determining factors for 

elevating the economic growth potential of Mozambique, and on the other hand, that of Castel-

Branco (2009), who, in his study of the development and challenges of mineral resources in relation 

to extractive industries in Mozambique, highlights “creating environmental awareness” in relation 

to natural resources by virtue of these only being renewable when there is a balance between the 

rate of production and the rate of extraction or exploitation. 

These two topics related to extractive industries in Mozambique lead to the ideas of 

Aaronson (2011: 50-53), according to whom there is the need for citizens to be the principal 

beneficiaries of the extraction and sale of resources while they still exist. For the author, who cites 

examples of countries like Nigeria, Mali, and Peru, the need for transparency in the area of 

extractive industries places organisation of CS and NGOs (local and non-local) as key players in 

the preservation of mineral resources. 

Other authors, such as Frei, Chaveiro &amp;amp; Macaringue (2016), point out the danger of 

appropriation and expropriation of mineral territories in Mozambique, because these practices 

benefit the holders of the capital that “(re)organise the local territories with the purpose of slowing 

down the demands of capitalist development”, prejudicing the local communities that are taken 

away from their zones and thus giving rise to land and natural resource conflicts in their survival 

base. 

According to the newspaper Notícias (07/26/2014), citing the previous Minister of Mineral 

Resources (who is the regulating authority of this sector) speaking at the presentation of the 

proposed revision of the Mining Law, the discovery of large reserves of minerals put the country 

on a national and international trajectory that would impose the need for adjusting the legislation 

in force prior to 2014. At this time in the country and on the continent, the debate about the need 



 

 26 

for all public and private actors intensified, and the communities each performed roles to guarantee 

that the discovery and the exploitation of natural resources would in fact be a blessing and not a 

curse (AR-VII/Parecer/379/16.07.2014). 

This scenario of new discoveries of mineral resources dictated the expansion and growth 

of investments that were supported by a legal regime that directed mining activity, namely law 

14/2002 of 26 June, the Mining law, and its regulations approved by Decree nº 26/2004 of 20 

August, Decree nº 62/2006 of 26 December, and Decree nº 20/2011 of 1 June. 

The prospects of the extractive industries sector were very much contested by RENAMO. 

The biggest opposition party considered that the discovery of resources would benefit only the 

political elite close to the ruling party; therefore, it demanded much more transparency in the 

management of the resources. In their studies, Macuane, Buur &amp;amp; Monjane (2017), citing Gordon 

(2015), allege that the discovery of these resources was the direct consequence of the return to 

conflict. In addition, other authors such as Green &amp;amp; Otto (2014) highlight the fact that certain types 

of natural resources were being discovered in zones of RENAMO’s influence, which were situated 

towards the north of the country where the opposition had gathered more votes. 

According to the IMF (2014), it is within this international juncture that the growth of the 

extractive industries made it necessary for the country to join the Initiative for Transparency in the 

Extractive Industries (EITI),14 taking into account that clear principles that assured greater 

transparency, equity, and sustainability in the exploitation of mineral resources were necessary. In 

addition, in 2012, Mozambique was considered to be in full compliance with the EITI, complying 

with the 2010 report (IMF, 2014). 

Since this natural resource boom in Mozambique in the mid-2000s, authors such as 

Selemane (2009) showed the need for public access to information on the transactions related to 

natural resources and, fundamentally, for fiscal transparency. For this reason, organisations like 

the CIP, a “pioneering organism highlighting the Extractive Industry since 2007 and launching 

publications about the sector in the country”, Institute of Social and Economic Studies (IESE), 

Observatory of Rural Means (OMR), Terra Viva Center (CTV), and platforms and forums 

                                                      
14 EITI is a global initiative of a voluntary character launched in 2002 by the then British Prime Minister Tony Blair 

aimed at improving governance in countries rich in mineral resources by means of the verification and publication of 
payments from companies and income collected by governments in the oil, gas, and mineral sectors (source: 

http://www.itie.org.mz/index.php/iniciativa/que-e-itie).  



 

 27 

connected to the extractive industry have shown the need for good governance in the sector by 

means of debates, lobbying work, and practical advocacy for transparency (Selemane, S/D). 

According to Nipassa (2017), the years from 2003 to 2005 were marked by the rise of some 

of these organisations congregating in networks of platforms and forums in Mozambique. For the 

author, platforms and forums often represented spaces created to establish communication between 

CS, the government, and donors capable of influencing the development of public policies. 

Since then, from 2007 onwards, platforms and forums aimed at the natural resources and 

extractive industries sectors appeared in the country, including Consultations about Forestry, 

Forum of Community Maintenance of Natural Resources, Friends of Forests, G20, JOINT, Forest 

Dialogue, National Forum of Biofuels, Platform of Climate Change, and Forum of Conservation, 

which work in specific sectors or on specific topics. 

Each one of these mechanisms that unites a – generally small – group of NGOs and that 

belongs to a network of platforms or forums has shown the need for the government to open up 

and show transparency in the management of resources. In this respect, Table 4.4.1 mentions the 

platforms, forums, and NGOs linked to the natural resources and extractive industries in 

Mozambique.

4.5 Platforms of CS on the Natural Resources and Extractive Industries versus the 

Proposed Mining Law and Petroleum Law 

 

The revision of the Petroleum Law published in 2012 highlighted the need for enriching the 

Petroleum Law, 3/2001 to better attend to the needs of the global petroleum industry (RL, 2012). 

For Nuvunga (2013), the proposal would constitute an important step in the preparation for 

the extractive industries sector to face the challenges that were approaching, in response to the 

needs of the government and the interests of petroleum companies, since the revision allowed for 

the incorporation of important aspects linked to the questions of infrastructure, the sharing of 

income, control and the protection of the environment (Abrahamson et al., 2013). 

According to Nuvunga (2013), this revision came about as a consequence of the discovery 

of natural gas in the Rovuma basin and the resulting prospects for the production of liquid natural 

gas (LNG), which would present a challenge for Mozambique in the process of reformulating its 

legal framework “in order to guarantee that new challenges for the sector were achieved in a secure, 

just and efficient way so as to attend to the needs of the country” (Abrahamson et al., 2013). 

At the time, the proposal made available by the Ministry of Mineral Resources (MMR) 

started a “debate” linked to the proposed Petroleum Law. In this logic, appeals from CS were made 

regarding the need for transparent governance and open public debates due to the strategic 

importance of extractive industries in the socioeconomic development of Mozambique (Nuvunga, 

2013). 

Still in 2012, the government presented a proposal to revise the Mining Law, preceded by 

a process of collecting contributions whose debates were about mining activity for the income of 

states, the inclusion of participation of Mozambicans in mining exploration, and the activities of 

rendering services to companies in the sector. Following the publication of the proposed revision 

of the Mining Law in 2012, the CIP (2012) made a general evaluation of the draft of the Mining 

Law that expressed the need for well crafted questions and the systematisation of the content and 

drafting.

CHAPTER 5 

 THE MAKING OF THE MINING AND PETROLEUM LAWS: VIEWS FROM 

KEY ACTORS IN CIVIL SOCIETY  

 

his chapter presents evidence on the interviews (see Appendix C for a script of the 

interviews) carried out, seeking to depict the nature of relations between key actors in 

civil society, and the relevant government actors. Thus, we will make a characterisation 

of the CS organisations that participated in the advocacy and lobbying campaigns aimed 

at approving the Mining Law and Petroleum Law (some of which were part of the Platform on 

Mineral Resources and Extractive Industries) and debate the question of the relationship between 

CS and the government, especially in the case of the Mining Law and the Petroleum Law. 

 

5.1 Characterisation of the Organisations that Were Interviewed 

 

Six organisation that form part of the Platform on Natural Resources and the Extractive Industries, 

which carried some weight in the approval of the Mining Law and the Petroleum law approved in 

2014, and one organisation (WLSA) that participated in the advocacy campaign were selected 

(CIP, CTV, AENA, WWF, AMA, and AAAJC). 

The organisations that were interviewed had different levels of involvement in the 

campaigns. 

According to Fátima Mimbiri,15 in the area of the extractive industries, CIP, while a private 

law collective and legal entity endowed with legal personality, “seeks to promote Good 

Governance of resources, it presupposes that the Government will sign contracts that are fair and 

beneficial for the country. To achieve these objectives, the CIP uses a system of naming and 

shaming to highlight bad practices, whether of public servants, or of companies, and above all 

exposes the appetites of the political elite that end up influencing government decisions”. 

Regarding characterisations of these organisations, it is possible to confirm that the CIP 

uses engagement with institutions – above all – in a platform of dialogue about the political 

proposals and reforms that the entity possesses (Mimbiri, 2017). 

                                                      
15 Fátima Mimbiri is responsible for the extractive industries division of the CIP and answered the questionnaire about 

the involvement of CS in the approval of the Mining Law and Petroleum Law.

The CTV acts throughout Mozambique. Its objectives are “to contribute to a better 

technical-scientific foundation for environmental decisions so that the appeals for public 

participation in environmental management included in policies, strategies, and in national 

environmental legislation are positively received by a CS with capacity to make informed and 

relevant contributions in that area”.16 

AENA is an organisation that promotes the sustainable management and governance of 

natural resources in a way that facilitates the socioeconomic development of rural communities by 

means of strengthening capacity, as well as creating and sharing knowledge. 

The objective of WWF, which is an organisation with almost five million associates spread 

over five continents and with a presence in Mozambique, is to stop the degradation of the planet 

and to promote the conservation of biodiversity, the reduction of pollution and of waste, and to 

assure the sustainability of natural resources. 

AMA is an environmental association created in 1990 by a group of youths in the city of 

Pemba, Cabo Delgado in the north of Mozambique, which has one of the biggest natural gas 

reserves in the world. With the objective of safeguarding natural resources, the Association Friends 

of the Environment is a reference for the sensitisation and strengthening of communities in the 

management of natural resources and the environment, and it is made up of more than seventy 

members of different origins. In addition to participating in big strategical decisions related to the 

management of natural resources and the environment, the interventions of the organisation are 

centred on the strengthening mechanisms of community participation and consulting in 

decentralised planning. 

AAAJC is an organisation that transmits its interests by means of initiatives in processes 

that are generally conducted in networks of platforms with other CSO partners. WLSA is an 

organisation that views the empowerment of women in the sense of bringing about changes in the 

law, public policies, access to the administration of justice, and social practices so that women may 

have the means and opportunities to combat discrimination. 

 

                                                      
16 Manuela Wing is responsible for the Education and Environment Information programme and answered the 

questionnaire about the involvement of CS in the approval of the Mining Law and Petroleum Law.

5.2 The Relationship Between CS and the Government: the Case of the Mining Law and 

Petroleum Law 

 

This subchapter describes the themes considered pertinent to the relationship between CS and the 

government in the case of the Mining Law and the Petroleum Law. For this analysis, we take into 

account a set of questions that will help us tackle the general objectives of the research, namely (i) 

to understand the acting mechanisms between CS and the government in political decisions in 

Mozambique and (ii) to classify the types of existing relationships between CS and the government 

in political decisions in Mozambique.  

 

5.2.1 Mechanisms Through Which Civil Society and Government Act: the Case of the 

Mining Law and Petroleum Law Approved in 2014 

 

In the first year of the 2010–2014 legislature, as in prior mandates, the Government of Mozambique 

was the entity that made the most submissions for the approval of laws by the Parliament. For 

example, in 2010 in its first session of the VII legislature of the Assembly of the Republic, it made 

29 legal initiatives, of which 16 came from the government and only 13 from the parties with seats 

in the Assembly of the Republic (Banze, 2011). 

In the first year of the VII legislature, the RENAMO parliamentary caucus led the legal 

initiatives by presenting 11 legal projects, which is a productivity rate of 68.75%. Notwithstanding 

the fact that it was the majoritarian party, FRELIMO presented 25% of the proposed laws, while 

the MDM presented 6.25% (Banze, 2011). 

According to the newspaper Notícias on 07/26/2014, during the same mandate, revisions 

to the Mining Law and the Petroleum Law were proposed as an initiative of the government. In 

fact, this was an important topic in the political agenda, and the official discourse was one of 

transparency and commitment with international standards and also of the need of protecting 

national interests. The following statements of the Former Minister of Mineral Resources 

Esperança Bias, are illustrative of this:  

 



 

 32 

The Government is legislating so there are no marginal negotiations, so that everything is done in 

compliance with the legislation. The contracts are public today, everyone has access to them, and it 

is all on the Ministry's website17. 

 

The assignment of rights for the initiation of extraction activities will respect national interests in 

relation to the defence, navigation, research and conservation of marine resources, existing 

economic activities and the environment in general18 

 

The proposed revision of the Mining Law that contained 68 articles and occurred 12 years after the 

approval of the first Mining Law. For the government, this proposal attempted to introduce other 

terms and conditions for the transfer of mining rights as a way of allowing the state to collect fair 

income by virtue of these rights and harmonising it with international best practices. In accordance 

with the aforementioned newspaper, this law was generally approved by the FRELIMO 

parliamentary caucus with 152 votes, and with 4 votes from the MDM bench and 43 abstentions 

from RENAMO.  

 

In this first phase of the process, CS did not participate; in fact, even in the critical/final phases 

of the process, there was a “closure” of the government, forcing some CS organisations such as 

the CIP to look for other forms to be involved in the process (Mimbiri, CIP). 

 

Thus, a process started that consisted of a public battle to achieve greater transparency in contracts 

for the exploitation of natural resources. We will discuss these strategies that CSOs used in the 

process that culminated in the approval of the Mining Law and the Petroleum Law in 2014 in detail 

and support them with testimonies of the organisations involved in this study. 

 

In the case of WWF Mozambique, “the organisation attempted to guarantee the biggest reach in 

public participation and active participation by means of critical reading and observations or 

contributions to enrich the legislation” (Pequenino, WWF).

 33 

At this level, WWF assumed its role based on the definition and preference of its strategies within 

this political context. Thus, for the participants, both in the government and in CS, the change of 

the legislature would be an important gain for the Mozambican State given the new challenges that 

were dawning. 

 

The National Association of Rural Extension (AENA) was one of the CS organisations that “made 

concrete proposals to the government to appeal for the use of means of rural communication in 

the process of sharing information that could contribute to the participation of communities” 

(AENA). 

AENA also proposed “legislation on the benefits for Mozambicans in contracts for the 

exploitation of natural resources, the relevant compensation of improvements, decent 

resettlements, corporate social responsibility, environmental questions, and forms of checking on 

the government” (AENA).  

 

In the meantime, this process was characterised as being regressive on the part of the government. 

 

Thus, civil society (in the case of CIP) had to go after the Parliament (Mimbiri, CIP). 

 

By means of the platform of organisations of civil society on the natural resources and extractive 

industries, the organisations united and contacted the government. Therefore, from the formal point 

of view, the platform became an institutional actor in the process. 

 

The actors made “use of newspapers to share the information about public consultations and sent 

letters to request contributions from institutions that have, as their mission, supporting the 

government to improve the legislative process  (Wing, CTV). 

 

In the meantime, the CSOs continued to put pressure, and to voice discontent with the way the 

process way being carried out. For example, during the revision of the Petroleum Law: 

 

There was no public consultation, as happened during the Mining Law and fiscal laws. And the 

CIP exposed the government critically and publicly (Mimbiri, CIP). 

 



 

 34 

Through the testimonies of the members of the organisations interviewed, we could confirm that 

there were no restrictions from a legal point of view on these organisations taking part in the 

process. The organisations used strategies and mechanisms for action, namely expressing their 

views vividly and openly through newspapers and reaching out to their networks in the platform. 

Despite the number of engaged CSOs being relatively small, compared to the number of existing 

organisations in the country, we could observe sings proactivity and horizontal cooperation in the 

behaviour of the entities taking part in this process. 

To analyse the nature of the typology of the relationship between CS and the government, 

it is important to have this background in mind; that CSOs were active and particularly interested 

in the political, economic, and environmental implications (among others) of the Mining and 

Petroleum Laws. In the following section the positioning of the government in this process is 

presented. 

 

5.2.2 Levels of Receptivity of the Government in Relation to CS 

 

In response to the proactivity of CSOs, the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy (MIREME), 

at the time headed by Esperança Bias, and the tax authority became the direct interlocutors of the 

platform. 

 

Naturally, because it is a proponent of mining and petroleum legislation (AENA).  

 

This way, it started a connection in the formal communication during the process. As a result of the 

pressure from civil society and the publication of articles, promotion of debates, organisation 

of seminars, lobby, and an intense campaign of advocacy afterwards, on 3 December 2013, the 

government announced the publication of contracts for the exploration of natural resources. 

Even so, the National Association of Rural Extension (AENA), an organisation taking part in 

the platform: 

 

(..) highlighted the need for transparency relating to the documents that give an account of the 

participation of Mozambicans in the exploration contracts (those that had 5% of the shares). 

(AENA). 

 



 

 35 

AENA was interested in knowing who these Mozambicans that held such a percentage were: 

  

“the value of the income that would be channelled into the communities, the question of fair 

compensation (what was meant by fair how did it apply, that is, the regulation), as well as the 

role of the High Authority of the Extractive Industries,19 which could not be subordinated to the 

Ministry of Natural Resources, but indeed to the Assembly of the Republic” (AENA). 

 

This preoccupation was also highlighted by the Association for the Legal Support and Assistance 

to Communities (AAAJC). 

 

For AAAJC, there was a conflict between CS and the government in relation to the entity under 

which the High Authority should be held accountable, because the government wanted the High 

Authority of the Extractive Industries to be subordinated to the Council of Ministers, while the 

CS wanted it to be subordinated to Parliament, considering that this was the organ representing 

the people. The existence of this conflict made it clear that the influence of the government is 

very strong. The Parliament never pronounced its stance on this topic referring to the creation of 

the High Authority of the Extractive Industries (Chucate, AAAJC 

 

Although WLSA did not contribute with any exact proposal regarding the drafting of the laws, 

the organisation was involved in the dissemination activities and participated in the advocacy 

campaign, performing:  

 

(…) interviews with provincial directors for the environment, energy, finance, education, health, 

and permanent secretaries on provincial and district levels (AENA). 

 

After a cycle of negotiations between the government and the platform, on 18 August 2014 the 

Mining Law was approved. In light of this it becomes pertinent to look at the attitude of the parties 

involved in this process. Some of the testimonies collected suggest that the government eventually 

recognized the role of CSOs: 

                                                      
19 At the time of the approval of the Mining Law, the Assembly of the Republic of Mozambique created a High 

Authority for the Extractive Industry, an entity that should have been established by the government by the end of 

2015. The role of the AAIE is summarised as the oversight of the mineral resources coming from extractive industries

independente)

Yes, the government has come to recognise civil society contribution to the contributions that 

have been made in this process (WWF). 

 

Yes, strategically it was necessary that this be done (AMA).  

 

Tthe government recognised that the proposed laws were drafted by means of a broad 

consultation of civil society, the private sector, and other intervening parties without, however, 

highlighting only one sector (AENA). 

 

Counter to this Mimbiri (CIP) stated that the government did not recognise the role of CS, while 

the Parliament acknowledged their importance, so much so that the Committee on Constitutional 

Affairs, Human Rights and the Committee on Agriculture, Economy and Environment issued 

statements about the involvement of CS. By way of example, the latter Committee:  

 

Received the CIP about the reformulation of article 7 of the Mining Law that was taken into 

consideration20 (Mimbiri, CIP). 

 

As mentioned in the methodological section, it was not possible to rely on testimonies from 

the key governing actors engaged in this process to countervail some of these views. Still the 

evidence collected on the side of CSOs allows us to draw some tentative conclusions on the nature 

of interactions between CSOs and the government. In fact, CSOs were quite proactive and engaged 

in series of actions to try and influence the law making process. The role of CSOs seemed to have 

been recognised at some point by the government and also by the parliamentary committees.  

Episodes of direct confrontation or of co-optation were not conveyed in the interviews: both sides 

seemed to have followed non-overlapping strategies but aimed at a similar outcome – to create 

more effective and transparent laws to regulate the extractive sector. This means that the nature of 

CSOs and government relations were closer to the complementarity ideal type. We develop this 

point further in the concluding section.   

                                                      
20 Article 7 of the Mining Law relates to mining contracts and mentions state participation in mining activities, local 

minimum content, a plan for technical professional training, a memorandum of understanding between companies, 

local government, and communities, and dispute resolution mechanisms (AR-VII/Parecer/379/16.07.2014)

CHAPTER 6  

 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE INVESTIGATION 

 

he last chapter of this dissertation presents the conclusion, where we reflect on the 

relationship between CS and the government, which, in context of our analysis, is 

classified as predominantly of “complementarity”. Firstly, we present the main results 

of the study depicting the interactions between the CS and the government and the 

formal arrangements made by CS to help its proposals get the attention of the government. 

Secondly, we reflect on the implications of this study for further research.  

 

6.1 Conclusion 

 

The analysis conducted in the preceding pages sought to examine the nature of CS and government 

relations in the context of a hybrid regime.  

Focusing on the Mozambique, we highlighted the signing of the General Peace Agreement 

as an important mark, because it created the political, social and legal conditions for the emergence 

and development of a new CS. Over time there has been a considerable increase in the number of 

CSOs, but we still know little about the nature of their interaction with the state. 

Seeking to help fill in this lacuna, this study was oriented towards a deeper research of the 

participation of the Mozambican CS in governance. The CS has played a pivotal role in the recent 

political history of Mozambique, namely promoting peace and political change, monitoring the 

quality of elections, advocating for human rights and for good governance.  

Nevertheless, this participation of CS was always reinforced to the degree that new 

challenges were imposed on the Mozambican state. It is within this context of new challenges that 

the Government of Mozambique and CS came across the discovery of natural resources in 2000, 

which resulted in the Council of Ministers of Mozambique proposing a revision of the Mining and 

Petroleum Laws. 

Therefore, our focus of investigation was about the participation of CS in the government, 

specifically when the Mining Law and Petroleum Law were approved in 2014. We wanted to know 

what the nature of the relationship between civil society and the government was during the process 

T 



 

 38 

of formulation and approval of these laws. For this purpose, we collected testimonies from seven 

key organisations. 

The organisations interviewed considered that the process was not easy: they had to be 

proactive and coordinate action, this resulted in a series of advocacy and lobbying campaigns 

carried out both individually or organised through the platform concerning the natural resources 

and extractive industries. 

During the investigation, two aspects come across as relevant. On one hand, the principle 

of good governance that is patent in the government’s 2010–2014 five-year plan, which reaffirms 

this strict collaboration with CS organisations. On the other hand, during the mandate led by 

Armando Emílio Guebuza soon after the publication of the revisions of the laws mentioned, CS 

and government institutions sought to affirm a continued role of responsibility before the 

government. In society in general, this situation aroused an interest in questions regarding 

participation in decision making and even about the necessity for transparency in the management 

of resources, which was a very important factor that marked the participation of CS. 

In the process of the approval of the Mining and Petroleum Laws, a factor of extreme 

importance that highlighted the participation of CS was the communication between the 

government and CS (a pertinent point considered in this investigation). 

The big objective of the investigation was to understand the nature of relationship between 

the CS and government. We came to the conclusion that the typology that best illustrates the 

interactions in the case study herein is “complementarity”. This is so, because CS and the 

Mozambican government both relied in different strategies but wanted effective laws to be 

approved. This is not to say that there were not of “tension”; in fact, according to AAAJC, the 

process was marked by some episodes of divergence between CS and the government in relation 

to the entity to which the High Authority of the Extractive Industry should be accountable. 

However the process was more characterised by complementary elements than confrontational 

ones. The associations mentioned, in the case of CIP and AAAJC, pointed to the way in which the 

government positioned itself for not recognising the role of CS in the process, while the 

parliamentary committees proved more hospitable. Other CSOs however, stated that there was 

recognition from the government.  

 



 

 39 

6.2 Perspectives for Future Investigation 

 

From these collected experiences in the case study, this research can contribute to the improvement 

of governance in Mozambique. We believe that future studies about these themes should better 

explore the means of communication of CS and the strategies that CS utilises to reach its objectives. 

As far as advocacy and lobbying strategies are concerned, one can question whether CS deals with 

a viable strategy or whether it largely reaches its objectives as far as the approval of laws are 

concerned.  

The present study sheds light about the relationships between CS and the government in a 

key sector of the Mozambican economy. However, up to what point does this apply to other areas? 

Future studies employing a comparative approach and utilizing more data, are necessary to provide 

a more satisfactory answer to these questions.

2- In the specific case 

of Law no. 20/2014, of 

August 18 (Law of 

Mines) and Law n.

3- What 

channels of 

communication 

(eg with the

and possibly 

with other 

CSOs) were 

used during 

the process of

4- Has your 

organization put 

forward concrete 

proposals? If so, 

which ones? 

5- Have you sought 

to coordinate your 

positions in a 

broader dialogue 

with other CSOs? 

If so, which ones? 

CIP  In the area of extractive industry is to 

promote good governance of resources, 

which presuppose that the government signs 

fair and beneficial contracts for the country, 

the country taxes properly and fairly, and 

communities are treated in a way that is 

conducive to the rights it has according to 

the law and with dignity. In order to achieve 

these objectives, CIP produces analysis texts 

on the decisions taken by the government, as 

well as on the processes, as well as 

proposals for reforms that are necessary to 

improve the management of the country's 

mineral resources. Likewise, the CIP uses a 

"name and shame" approach, but practices 

both public servants and companies and 

above all denounces the appetites of the 

political elite that end up influencing 

government decisions. 

I can only speak on 

behalf of the CIP, 

although we know that 

other organizations have 

also participated / been 

involved. 

The CIP actively 

participated in the 

process of revising the

participating in public 

consultations or in 

dialogue with relevant 

government entities and 

parliamentary 

committees in the

legislation. The CIP

WWF The Mozambican Civil Society to be able to 

communicate with each other uses the 

conventional means - communication via e-

mails of member organizations and websites 

when they exist. The member organizations 

are organized in Platforms - in this case 

there is a Platform of Civil Society 

Organizations for the Extractive Industry 

and Natural Resources, recognized as a valid 

interlocutor with the Mozambican 

government and extractive industry 

companies 

The level of 

involvement of 

organizations such as 

WWF Mozambique was 

to ensure that there was 

as wide a scope as 

possible in the process 

of public hearings and 

active participation 

through reading and 

critical remarks or 

contributions to enrich 

legislation. WWF 

Mozambique, in 

coordination with other 

civil society 

organizations, secured 

through work meetings 

the collection of 

subsidies and 

contributions during the 

process in which the 

mining and oil and gas 

laws were being drafted 

until their submission to 

the Mozambican 

Parliament. 

The 

communication 

channels used 

during the 

drafting of these 

laws were 

workshops, 

round tables, 

seminars, e-

mails, informal 

meetings among 

the key actors in 

the process 

The means used 

were Workshops 

or working 

meetings with 

representatives of 

the stakeholders 

where each side 

presented their 

points of view and 

gave the 

opportunity for 

others to 

comment. When 

the final version 

was presented to 

the 

Parliamentarians 

of the National 

Assembly, they 

validated the Law. 

The Civil Society 

Platform for the 

Extractive Industry 

has a Coordination 

Committee that is 

composed of some 

member 

organizations of the 

Platform. It was this 

smaller group that 

bridged the opinions 

that were collected 

in the Provinces in 

discussion meetings 

or in National 

Conferences that 

compiled the final 

opinions and 

channeled them to 

the Ministry of 

Mineral Resources. 

WWF and the 

member 

organizations of the 

Extractive Industry 

Platform did not 

need another 

intermediary to 

dialogue with the 

government. As 

previously 

mentioned, the 

Platform is a valid 

interlocutor 

recognized by the 

government itself.

     CSO 

6- What was the level 

of government 

receptiveness to your 

proposals and 

claims? 

7- Who were 

the 

government 

interlocutors 

with whom 

you spoke 

during the 

drafting of 

these laws? 

8- Did these 

interlocutors 

belong to any 

ministry with a 

direct interest in 

the approval of the 

diplomas, or were 

they from other 

entities chosen by 

the government? 

9- In your 

opinion, is the 

CSOs 

involvement in 

this process a 

result of the 

Government 

initiative or the 

proactivity of 

CSOs? 

10- The process was 

peaceful or there 

were phases of some 

turbulence. If so, how 

did it manifest itself 

11- Has the 

government publicly 

acknowledged the 

contribution of CSOs 

after passing laws in

In some cases

yes In an initial 

phase it was 

initiative of the 

Government. 

But in the 

critical / last 

phases of the 

process, there 

was closure. 

Thus, civil 

society had to 

go behind the 

parliament. 

There was turbulence 

in the revision of the 

oil law, that there was 

no public consultation, 

as happened with the 

law of mines and tax 

laws. And the CIP 

exposes the 

Government critically 

and publicly. 

The Government does 

not, but the parliament 

does. The 1st and 5th 

committees recognized 

the contribution of 

civil society in their 

opinions.

AAAJC Reasonable except for 

the issue of 

community 

development funds 

(Article 20 of the 

Mining Law) and the 

issue of State 

expropriation of land 

in favor of the private 

sector and not for 

public utility (Article 

27/2 Minas Law) and 

Promotion of National 

Business (Article 34 

Mining Law) 

With none! The Government in 

general has not had 

a healthy 

relationship with 

civil society, due to 

the fact that in 

recent times there is 

a deficit of the law 

enforcement by the 

Government. In 

relation to the 2 

laws in question, 

the AAAJC as 

CSOs is represented 

by the National 

Platform on Natural 

Resources and 

Extractive Industry 

and the Extractive 

Industry 

Transparency 

Initiative in 

Mozambique 

(EITI). In the scope 

of the Platform, the 

latter, a survey was 

carried out to 

evaluate the Mining 

Law, having 

concluded that the 

articles referred to 

in paragraph 4 did 

not meet 

expectations. 

As already 

mentioned, little 

communication 

exists between 

the State and 

CS, especially 

when it is 

intended to pass 

laws. The 

processes in a 

fund are only to 

formalize a 

process that has 

already been 

decided by the 

technicians 

hired by the 

Government, 

who in most 

cases carry out 

extrapolations 

with the 

appropriate 

adaptations of 

laws of our 

legal neighbors, 

such as 

Portugal, RSA 

and very 

recently Brazil . 

The Government does 

not see any use in the 

activities of the CS, so 

very recently it had 

produced a proposal to 

revise the Law of 

Associations without 

accepting any of CS 

contributions, the main 

interested party. 

Fortunately, the 

Constitutional Court 

considered this 

proposal 

unconstitutional. 

The only known role 

represented by 

Parliament was the 

adoption of the Laws 

in question. To give an 

example that the 

parliament was not 

very committed to the 

process, look for the 

art. 25 of the Mining 

Law, which provides 

for the creation of the 

High Authority of the 

Extractive Industry. 

There is a conflict 

between CS and the 

Government regarding 

the entity under which 

the High Authority is 

accountable. The 

Government wants it 

to be the Council of 

Ministers; while the 

CS wants it to be 

under Parliament, 

since this body is the 

representative of the 

people. Parliament has 

not spoken on the 

subject, which 

suggests that the 

influence of the 

Government is quite 

strong.

and integrated into the 

final version of the 

Legislation

result of the 

collaboration 

that was already 

taking place, 

was open 

enough to 

accept with 

interest the 

participation of 

Civil Society. 

Given the 

explosion of 

interest in the 

exploitation of 

natural 

resources in 

Mozambique, 

the government 

felt the need to 

strengthen its 

legal framework 

in the extractive 

sector 

moments of tension as 

Civil Society has been 

pushing the 

Government for 

greater transparency 

with regard to the 

content of the 

contracts, namely the 

provision of 

information on who is 

the partner of the 

exploring companies 

and what are the fees 

charged either for 

contracts / licenses and 

on corporate revenues 

and the Government's 

reaction is not always 

positive with regard to 

the publication of this 

type of information. 

But it was not a very 

tense process

contributions that have 

been made in this 

process.
