Abstract

This study describes the occurrence of dogs naturally co-infected with Hepatozoon canis and two Leishmania species: 
L. infantum or L. braziliensis. Four dogs serologically diagnosed with Visceral Leishmaniasis were euthanized. Liver 
and spleen samples were collected for histopathological analysis and DNA isolation. H. canis meronts were observed in 
tissues from all four dogs. H. canis infection was confirmed by PCR followed by sequencing of a fragment of 18S rRNA 
gene. Leishmania detection and typing was confirmed by ITS1’ PCR-RFLP and parasite burden was calculated using 
ssrRNA quantitative qPCR. A DPP - Dual Path platform test was performed. One out (Dog #2) of four animals was 
asymptomatic. Dogs #1 and #4 were infected by L. infantum and were DPP test positive. Dogs #2 and #3 were infected 
by L. braziliensis and were DPP test negative. Furthermore, visceral dissemination was observed in Dogs #2 and #3, 
since L. braziliensis was detected in liver and spleen samples. The visceral dissemination of L. braziliensis associated with 
systemic signs suggested that this co-infection could influence the parasite burden and disease progression.

Keywords: Hepatozoonosis, canine visceral leishmaniasis, Leishmania infantum, Hepatozoon canis, co-infection,

Resumo

O presente estudo descreve a ocorrência de coinfecção com Hepatozoon canis e duas espécies de Leishmania 
(L. infantum ou L. braziliensis) em cães. Quatro cães sorologicamente diagnosticados com leishmaniose visceral foram 
eutanasiados. Amostras do baço e fígado foram submetidas à histopatologia e extração de DNA. Merontes de H. canis 
foram observados nos quatro cães. A infecção por H. canis foi confirmada por PCR e sequenciamento de um fragmento 
do gene 18S rRNA. A infecção por Leishmania e tipagem foram realizadas por PCR-RFLP do região intergênica ITS1. 
A carga parasitária foi calculada pela qPCR quantitativa baseada no gene ssrRNA. O teste DPP - Dual Path platform 
foi realizado. Apenas o Cão #2 era assintomático. Os cães #1 e #4 estavam infectados com L. infantum e foram positivos 
no DPP. Os cães #2 e #3 estavam infectados com L. braziliensis e foram negativos no DPP. Além disso, visceralização 
foi observada nos cães #2 e #3, nos quais L. braziliensis foi detectada em amostras de baço e fígado. A visceralização da 
L. braziliensis associada a sinais clínicos sistêmicos sugerem que esta coinfecção pode ter influenciado na carga parasitária 
e progressão da doença.

Introduction

Canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is a zoonotic disease 
endemic in various countries. In Brazil, visceral leishmaniasis is 
caused by the protozoa Leishmania infantum. The dog is considered 
an important urban reservoir and the detection of canine cases 
may precede the occurrence of human visceral leishmaniasis 
(BELO et al., 2013). The current public health policy in Brazil 
demands the culling of infected dogs -based on serologic tests - for 
VL control (BRASIL, 2006). Cross-reactivity using Leishmania 
infantum antigen with sera from Leishmania braziliensis-infected 
dogs is commonly observed (BRASIL, 2006), but dog culling, in 
this case, is not recommended. Dogs infected with L. braziliensis 
commonly present localized skin lesions without systemic 
dissemination (MADEIRA et al., 2005). The urban reservoir of 
L. braziliensis is still not known in Brazil.

Canine hepatozoonosis is a systemic disease caused by 
Apicomplexa protozoa of the genus Hepatozoon, that is transmitted 
by ingestion of infected ticks belonging to the genus Rhipicephalus 
(RUBINI  et  al., 2008; KAUR  et  al., 2012; MIRANDA  et  al., 
2014). Domestic dogs can be infected by two species: H. canis 
and H. americanum (O’DWYER, 2011). The infected animals 
usually present low parasitemia (MUNDIM  et  al., 2008). 
Clinically, Hepatozoon infected-animals can present anorexia, lack 
of appetite, fever, pale mucosa, lethargy, diarrhea and vomiting 
(CHHABRA  et  al., 2013). Hematological alterations, such as 
anemia, leucocytosis and neutrophilia or lymphopenia, have also 
been observed (KAUR et al., 2012). Many of these clinical signs 
described for canine hepatozoonosis are also observed in CVL.

In Brazil, Hepatozoon has been observed since 1979, when 
Massard studied the infection (O’DWYER, 2011). Molecular 
characterization indicated that Brazilian H. canis was closely 
related to isolates from Japan, presented 99% nucleotide identity 
with isolates from Israel and was found to be distantly related to 
H. americanum (RUBINI et al., 2005). In the following years, canine 
hepatozoonosis has also been described in several Brazilian regions 
(RUBINI et al., 2008; MIRANDA et al., 2014; GONÇALVES et al., 
2014; RAMOS et al., 2015; DEMONER et al., 2016). Many of 
these areas are also endemic for CVL, and co-infection has already 
been described in dogs from Rio Grande do Norte based only 
on molecular analyses (GONÇALVES et al., 2014). Herein, we 
described the occurrence of co-infection of dogs with H. canis and 
L. infantum or L. braziliensis, using molecular and histopathological 
analyses. In addition, the co-infection of H. canis and L. braziliensis 
could have lead to visceral dissemination, which may lead to a 
false CVL diagnosis.

Material and Methods

Animals and samples

Four seropositive dogs (IFAT - Bio-Manguinhos and ELISA 
- Bio-Manguinhos) for Leishmania, two from Barra do Garças 
(Latitude: 15° 53’ 24” S; Longitude: 52° 15’ 24” W) and two 
from Cuiabá (Latitude: 15° 35’ 46” S; Longitude: 56° 05’ 48” W), 
Mato Grosso state, were included in this study. Clinical evaluations 

were performed before euthanasia and were performed by 
veterinarians at the Zoonosis Control Center (Centro de Controle 
de Zoonoses - CCZ). The procedure included the administration 
of 1.0 ml/Kg of 1.0% Thiopental intravenously (Thiopentax?, 
Cristália) for anesthesia. Once the absence of corneal reflex due 
to deep anesthesia was confirmed, 10 mL of 19.1% potassium 
chloride (Isofarma) was intravenously administered. During 
necropsy, fragments from spleen and liver were collected for 
histopathological analysis and molecular techniques. Samples were 
also forwarded to the Leishmania Collection of the Oswaldo Cruz 
Institute (CLIOC, www.clioc.fiocruz.br) for parasite isolation and 
typing. In addition, serum samples were collected and tested with 
the rapid Dual Path Platform test (DPP CVL, BioManguinhos, 
FIOCRUZ), which detects anti-rK26/39 Leishmania antibodies 
(GRIMALDI et al., 2012).

Ethics statement

The animals included in this study were naturally infected 
and destined to euthanasia as recommended by the politics of 
Brazilian Ministry of Health. All procedures performed in the 
present study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the 
institution or practice. The present research uses tissues fragments 
after euthanasia, so the study did not need to be submitted for 
The Ethics Committee on Animal Use (CEUA) according to 
Brazilian’s Law 11794/08.

Leishmania spp. isolation

Spleen samples were cultured in tubes with biphasic medium 
containing Schneider liquid medium for Drosophyla (Sigma) 
with 10-20% fetal bovine serum and NNN medium as solid 
phase. The tubes were maintained at 25 °C in Biological Oxygen 
Demand (B.O.D.) incubator (Contemp). The cultures were 
evaluated every 5 days for promastigotes growth and maintained 
at least for 4 weeks.

DNA extraction

Total DNA was isolated from approximately 10 mg of both 
spleen and liver samples using QIAmp? DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, 
CA, USA), which included a prior phase of digestion with 20 ?l 
of proteinase K (20 mg/mL) for 1 h at 56 °C. DNA was dissolved 
in 50 ?l of Tris EDTA buffer (AE buffer) and quantified via 
NanoDrop? (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

Molecular detection of Leishmania spp.

The molecular detection of Leishmania spp. by PCR targeting 
the ITS1 intergenic region was employed (GRAÇA  et  al., 
2012). Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) was 
performed for Leishmania species identification. The ITS1 PCR 
product was submitted to digestion using Sau 3AI and loaded on 
12.5% polyacrylamide gel (Genephor). Two Leishmania reference 
strains were used as controls: IOC/L 579 (Li - Leishmania (L.)

infantum- MHOM/BR/1974/PP75) and IOC/L 566 (Lb - Leishmania 
(V.) braziliensis- MHOM/BR/1975/M2903).

Determination of Leishmania spp. burden by 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)

Leishmania parasite burden in spleen samples was estimated 
by quantitative real-time PCR (Step One equipment, Applied 
Biosystems, Molecular Probes, Inc.) using the detection system 
Power Sybr Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Molecular 
Probes, Inc.). Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 
(HPRT) primers were chosen to normalize the concentrations of 
canine DNA in each sample; the primers described by Prina et al 
(PRINA et al., 2007) were used to amplify a product corresponding 
to the small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssrRNA), a multi-copy 
gene of Leishmania spp. parasites. DNA (100 ng in 2 ?l) was 
added to a final PCR reaction volume of 20 ?l containing Power 
Sybr Green 1X, 300 nM of each primer for HPRT and 500 nM 
for ssrRNA PCR assays. Reactions were submitted to a initial 
denaturation at 95 °C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 
denaturation, annealing and extension (95 °C for 15 seconds, 
60°C for 1 minute and 68 °C for 30 seconds) with the option 
for a melt curve ranging from 60 °C to 95 °C and an incremental 
temperature of 0.3 °C for second and a Tm 78 ± 2 °C. Reactions 
were performed in duplicate and both targets were run within 
the same plate for the same sample.

The number of cells from peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMC) of non-infected dogs and cultures of L. infantum 
promastigotes (MCAN/BR/2007/CG-1) were determined 
by a cell counter (Z1™ COULTER COUNTER?, Beckman 
Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). The total DNA was isolated from 
1.0 × 106 PBMC cells and 1.0 × 107promastigotes. Standard 
curves for the HPRT (R2=0.966, slope= –2.98, efficiency=1.13, 
y-intercepto=34.143) and ssrRNA genes (R2=0.943, slope= –2.67, 
efficiency=1.18, y-intercepto=28.117) were prepared using serial 
10-fold dilutions from 10–2 to 107 of total purified DNA. All 
reactions were performed in duplicate in microtubes (Applied 
Biosystems). The parameters were according with MIQE guidelines 
(BUSTIN et al., 2009).

Molecular detection of H. canis

H. canis was detected by PCR based on the amplification 
of a fragment of 666 pb of 18S rDNA gene, using HepF 

(5’ – ATA-CAT-GAG-CAA-AAT-CTC-AAC- 3’) and HepR 
(5’ – CTT-ATT-ATT-CCA-TGC-TGC-AG-3’) primers 
(INOKUMA et al., 2002) and the GoTaq? DNA Polymerase kit 
(Promega, WI, USA). PCR was performed with a denaturation 
step at 94 °C for 3 minutes, followed by 37 cycles of denaturation, 
annealing and extension (94°C for 45 seconds, 57 °C for 45 seconds 
and 72 °C for 1 minute), and a final extension step (72 °C for 
7 minutes).

PCR products were purified using ExoSAP? IT (GE Healthcare) 
accordingly to the manufacturer’s recommendations and sequenced 
using the BigDye v.3.1 Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready 
Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in an 
automated Applied Biosystems ABI 3500 DNA genetic analyzer 
(Applied Biosystems). All sequences obtained were analyzed in 
the software package Phred/Phrap/Consed Version: 0.020425.c 
(University of  Washington, Seattle, WA, USA) and presented Phred 
values above 20 Sequences were edited using BioEdit software, 
version 7.2.5 (HALL, 1999) and compared for similarity using 
BLAST to the sequences available in GenBank (NCBI, 2016).

Phylogenetic analysis were based on the sequences obtained 
in the study and sequences retrieved in from GenBank. Multiple 
alignment analysis was performed using the Clustal X version 2.0 
(LARKIN et al., 2007), and aphylogenetic tree was constructed based 
on the Neighbor-Joining algorithm andthe Kimura 2-parameter 
model for generating the distance matrix. As implemented in 
Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) version 
6 (TAMURA  et  al., 2013) Bootstrap of 1000 replicates were 
performed to estimate the confidence of the branching patterns 
(FELSENSTEIN, 1985). Histopathology

Spleen and liver fragments were fixed in 10% buffered formalin 
for one to four weeks, embedded in paraffin and sliced in 5-?m 
thick sections to be mounted on microscope slides. The sections 
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and examined by 
light microscopy (Nikon Eclipse E400 – Tokyo, Japan). Structural 
changes of spleen lymphoid tissue, the cell population in the red 
pulp and the parasite burden were analyzed.

Results

The sampled dogs presented different clinical signs and 
Leishmania spp. parasite burdens, but all four were co-infected 
with Leishmania spp. and Hepatozoon spp. Each case is presented 
separately and differential diagnosis is summarized in Table 1.

Description of cases

Dog 1: A male dog from Cuiabá, state of Mato Grosso, 
presenting cachexy and ascites. Parasite isolation was positive 
and the species identified as L. infantum in the spleen and liver 
(Figure 1). The splenic histopathological analysis showed an organized 
white pulp and many mature meronts of H. canis (Figure 2a-e). 
Histological alterations in the liver were not observed. Molecular 
analysis of Hepatozoon canis was not performed (Table 1).

Dog 2: Asymptomatic male dog from Barra do Garças, 
state of Mato Grosso. Although parasite isolation was negative, 
PCR-RFLP confirmed L. braziliensis infection in spleen and 
liver samples (Figure  1). The histopathological analysis of the 
spleen showed an organized white pulp and mature meronts 
of H. canis. The liver presented an intense non-granulomatous 
inflammation, with vacuolar degeneration, intense fibrosis and 
colestasis. Amastigotes were observed in the liver (Figure  2f ). 
= Hepatozoon spp. DNA was only detected in spleen and the 
sequences showed 100% identicalness with H. canis by BLAST 
analysis (Tables 2, 3, Figure 3).

Dog 3: A male dog from Barra do Garças, state of Mato Grosso, 
presenting cachexy, lymphadenomegaly, onychogryphosis and 
conjunctivitis. Parasite isolation was negative; species detection 
was performed confirming L. braziliensis infection in a spleen 
sample (Figure  1). In the liver sample, the digestion of ITS1 
PCR product generated inconclusive results. Histopathological 
analysis of the spleen showed intense disorganization of white 
pulp, perisplenitis, absence of granuloma and mature meronts 
of Hepatozoon canis. The liver presented intense and diffuse 
non-granulomatous inflammation, with vacuolar degeneration and 
amastigotes. Hepatozoon spp. DNA was detected in the spleen and 
liver and the sequences showed 100% identicalness with H. canis 
by BLAST analysis (Tables 2, 3, Figure 3).

Dog 4: A female dog from Cuiabá, state of Mato Grosso, 
presenting alopecia, onychogryphosis, dermatitis and conjunctivitis. 
Parasite isolation was negative, though the infection by L. infantum 
was confirmed in the spleen and liver (Figure 1) by PCR-RFLP. 
Histopathological analysis of the spleen showed moderate 
disorganization of the white pulp, amastigotes and mature 
meronts of H. canis. The liver presented only a moderate and 
diffuse non-granulomatous inflammation. Molecular detection 
of H. canis was not performed.

   7Hepatozoon canis and Leishmania spp. coinfection

Discussion

In the present study, H. canis infection and co-infection with 
Leishmania spp. were confirmed through histopathological and 
molecular analyses in the spleen for the first time in dogs from Barra 
do Garças, Mato Grosso state - Brazil. In silico analysis showed 
that the ssrRNA and 18S rRNA primers used in this work were 
specific for Leishmania spp. and Hepatozoon spp., respectively (data 
not shown), and did not generate cross-reaction. We observed 
100% identicalness between our sequences with H. canis from 
Croatia and other regions of Brazil, suggesting either a geographic 
expansion of this infection or a recent increase in the efficiency 
in detecting these parasites. Recently, canine hepatozoonosis has 
been described in several Brazilian regions (RUBINI et al., 2008; 
MIRANDA et al., 2014; GONÇALVES et al., 2014; RAMOS et al., 
2015; DEMONER  et  al., 2016). Many of these areas are also 
endemic for CVL and co-infection was indeed described in dogs 
from Rio Grande do Norte, but only through molecular analysis 
(GONÇALVES et al., 2014).

The pathogenesis of H. canis infection is influenced by 
immunodeficiency conditions, an immature immune system 
in young pups, or a concurrent infectious agent (BANETH, 
2011). Conditions that impair the immune responses increase 
the susceptibility to new infection with H. canis or allow existing 
infections to reactivate. Co-infections with Toxoplasma, Leishmania, 
Babesia or Ehrlichia predispose dogs to clinical illness (BANETH, 
2011). Detection of L. braziliensis parasites DNA in the liver and 
spleen shows the probability of the visceralization of this species 
in dogs presenting comorbidities. Although DNA detection 
may not show the presence of viable parasites, additional results 
(observation of amastigotes and ELISA and IFAT positivity) 
confirmed the infection. Currently, L. braziliensis is considered a 
dermotrophic species in the human leishmaniasis disease complex, 
with isolation and detection of this species in the viscera only in 
cases of immunologically compromised patients (SILVA  et  al., 
2002; GONTIJO et al., 2002). In wild and synantropic animals 
(considered potential reservoirs for L. braziliensis), such a distinction 
regarding tissue tropism does not exist (ROQUE  et  al., 2010; 
ROQUE &amp;amp; JANSEN, 2014), and the parasite may be detected 
in many organs. In dogs, this species has only been detected in 
cutaneous lesions (MADEIRA et al., 2005; DANTAS-TORRES, 
2007). The visceralization detected herein by L. braziliensis may 
be a consequence of the impaired immune system of the dogs. 
Such an immunological deficit may be due to either Hepatozoon 
infection alone or the increased virulence due to co-infection. These 
hypotheses are difficult to verify, but the first is more likely since 
the two dogs infected with L. braziliensis showed lower parasite 
burden than the dog infected by L. infantum, and only one was 
symptomatic. If we consider that there is a relationship between 
clinical signs and parasite burden (TEIXEIRA-NETO et al., 2010), 
the clinical signs described in dog #3 must have been related to 
the infection by Hepatozoon. Visceralization of L. braziliensis 
strains was previously reported in dogs (OLIVEIRA et al., 2013). 
Although the authors attributed dissemination and tissue tropism 

of populations to a distinct genetic profile, they did not mention 
if there were comorbidities in the evaluated dogs.

Therefore, other studies are needed to highlight the potential 
influence of the immune response that both infections could have 
on each other. The understanding of this co-infection is crucial 
since the impaired immune response to leishmaniasis may lead 
to an increased severity of the disease and, consequently, to a 
high Leishmania parasite burden and dissemination. This may 
be - at some point - related to the potential of dogs as reservoirs. 
The visceralization of L. braziliensis, whether related with the 
co-infection with Hepatozoon or not, raises a question about its 
impact on Leishmania parasite burden and consequently on the 
role of dogs as a source of infection to vectors.

In this study, two animals were infected by L. braziliensis 
and, for this reason, were unnecessarily submitted to euthanasia. 
They were DPP negative, which suggests this test may be a good 
tool for the differential diagnosis and euthanasia. Although 
cross-reaction could be observed by ELISA based on DPP antigens 
with sera from dogs infected with Leishmania braziliensis, this 
cross-reaction is less frequent than that observed when using 
crude antigens (PORROZZI et al., 2007). Nevertheless, it is not 
expected that this cross-reaction occurs in immunochromatographic 
tests. Because only two animals were evaluated in the present 
study, this hypothesis must be better verified. In spite of that, 
the data points out the importance in performing an etiological 
diagnosis at the species level. Since 2012, DPP? (rK39 antigen, 
Biomanguinhos) has been used as a screening test for CVL 
followed by confirmation with an ELISA test to identify animals 
for euthanasia when they are positive by both methods. However, 
when the samples used herein were collected, DPP? had not been 
used as a method to diagnose CVL yet. For these two dogs, clinical 
signs attributed to Leishmania infection could actually be related 
to Hepatozoon infection, since L. braziliensis species does not lead 
to such clinical profile. Hepatozoon infection could in turn cause 
immunosuppression leading to the visceralization of Leishmania 
braziliensis. In this context, the importance of a complementary 
diagnosis in the veterinary clinical evaluation, either molecular 
or serological, is clear. Additionally, the impact of co-infection 
with Leishmania spp. and Hepatozoon spp. or other pathogens 
(Ehrlichia canis, Babesia spp., Anaplasma spp., etc.) on clinical 
manifestations, the immune response and the parasite burden 
needs to be clarified.

Conclusion

In the present work, Hepatozoon canis infection and co-infection 
with Leishmania braziliensis were identified for the first time in Barra 
do Garças, Mato Grosso state, Brazil. From this report, the main 
points were addressed: i) visceral dissemination of L. braziliensis 
associated with systemic signs suggested that this co-infection 
could have influenced the parasite burden, the parasite spread, 
morbidity, clinical signs and, possibly, the role of co-infected 
dogs as reservoirs; ii) it is important for veterinarians to promote 
a differential diagnosis for co-infected dogs, with an emphasis on 
defining the involved Leishmania species.
