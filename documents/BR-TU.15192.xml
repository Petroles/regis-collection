resumo 
 
 

As comunidades estuarinas de bacterioplâncton desenvolvem -se sob 
condições ambientais instáveis e respondem às variações espaciais e 
temporais de pequena escala das características da coluna de água com 
alterações dos níveis de actividade heterotrófica. 
A reactividade bacteriana foi avaliada no campo, em diferentes interfaces 
estuarinas e foi também testada em laboratório. A degradação ectoenzimática 
de péptidos (actividade da leucina-aminopeptidase E.C. 3.4.11) e hidratos de 
carbono (actividade da ? -glucosidase E.C. 3.2.21), bem como parâmetros de 
caracterização da absorção de glucose (Vm e Tr), foram usados como 
descritores das respostas metabólicas das bactérias do plâncton.  
Os perfis estuarinos de abundância bacteriana, absorção e incorporação de 
glucose e actividade ectoenzimática corresponderam globalmente a um padrão 
curvilíneo com máximos na gama de 20-30 UPS. Associada à  transição entre 
os ambientes dulciaquícola e estuarino, registou -se uma alteração no padrão 
de utilização de substratos orgânicos traduzida pelo aumento da 
preponderância de proteína sobre hidratos de carbono, como substratos para o 
crescimento bacteriano, em relação directa com a proximidade do mar. 
Os decréscimos de actividade do bacterioplâncton nas fronteiras com o rio e 
com o oceano foram mais pronunciados do que o esperado por diluição 
conservativa, confirmando assim a natureza reactiva do metabolismo 
bacteriano sujeito às condições naturais de instabilidade associadas a estas 
interfaces estuarinas.  
As respostas de comunidades bacterianas naturais, obtidas em secções 
contrastantes do sistema estuarino, a variações de curto prazo das 
características da água foram testadas em laboratório com recurso a câmaras 
de difusão. O elevado grau de susceptibilidade das taxas de actividade 
bacteriana à modulação ambiental traduziu-se em variações rápidas e intensas 
dos níveis de actividade. Os resultados laboratoriais sugerem que o controle 
ambiental é exercido fundamentalmente através dos compostos dissolvidos. 
Não ficou claramente demonstrada a contribuição de partículas ressuspensas 
dos fundos sedimentares ou transportadas de zonas intertidais para a 
actividade heterotrófica das bactérias da coluna de água. 
Embora os biótopos pouco profundos predominem no sistema estuarino da Ria 
de Aveiro, a maior parte da mineralização aeróbia da matéria orgânica ocorre 
na coluna de água. A troca de água entre o estuário e o oceano durante o ciclo 
de maré resulta num fluxo líquido de comunidades bacterianas e actividades 
associadas da Ria para o mar, com formação de uma pluma costeira de 
elevada biomassa bacteriana e potencial heterotrófico.  
 

 



 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

abstract 
 

Estuarine bacterioplankton communities develop under unstable environmental 
conditions and respond to short -term or short -distance variations of water 
properties with changes in activity rates. Bacterial reactivity was evaluated in 
the field, at distinct estuarine boundaries, and further tested in the laboratory. 
The ectoenzymatic degradation of peptides (activity of the leucine -
aminopeptidase E.C. 3.4.11) and carbohydrates (activity of the ? -glucosidase 
E.C. 3.2.21) and the parameters describing the uptake of glucose (Vm and Tr), 
were used as proxies for the assessment of bacterial metabolic responses. 
Within the estuarine gradient, the profiles of bacterial abundance, glucose 
uptake and ectoenzymatic activity generally agreed with a curvilinear pattern 
with maxima within the 20-30 PSU range. At the transition from the limnetic 
environment to the main body of the estuary, a shift in the utilization of organic 
substrates occurred with an increasing importance of proteins over 
carbohydrates with decreasing distance to the sea.  
Bacterioplankton activity decreased at both riverine and oceanic boundaries 
more than expected from conservative dilution, therefore confirming the 
reactive nature of bacterial metabolism at these highly unstable estuarine 
interfaces. 
Diffusion chambers were used to test in the laboratory the responses of natural 
bacterial assemblages from distinct estuarine sections to short-term variations 
in water properties. Rapid and intense shifts between levels of activity 
confirmed the high degree of susceptibility of bacterial activity rates to 
environmental modulation and suggest that the control is mostly exerted 
through the dissolved pool of substrates.  
The influence of sediment resuspension and of the input of particles from the 
intertidal zones on the rates of bacterioplankton activity in the water column 
could not be clearly demonstrated.  
Although shallow biotopes account for the majority of the area corresponding to 
the complex estuarine system of Ria de Aveiro, most of the aerobic 
mineralization of organic matter occurs in the planktonic compartment. The tidal 
exchange of water between the estuary and sea results in a net seaward flux of 
bacterial communities and associated activities expressed by a coastal plume 
of enhanced bacterioplankton standing stocks and heterotrophic potential.

The dynamic behaviour of the estuarine environments is a long recognised attribute 

of these particular environments. The metabolic flexibility of the estuarine biota results in 
high rates of primary and secondary production (Cadeé, 1986; Sherr and Sherr, 1996). 
Estuaries have always been preferential settlement sites: (1) they are semi-enclosed natural 
harbours; (2) they effectively trap nutrients and are rich in sources of food; (3) they are 
natural transport centres connecting oceans and inland waters (Cronin, 1967). However, 
human activities may significantly change the organic matter loading, and physical factors, 
such as wind and water circulation, are capable of changing estuarine conditions over small 
temporal scales (Schulz Jr and Ducklow, 2000).  

Coastal eutrophication is a problem that assumes a particular relevance in estuarine 
ecology. If the definition of estuary is extended to include all the transition zones between 
rivers and oceans, estuaries are the major contributors to the loading of open oceans with 
organic and inorganic materials (Martin and Gordeev, 1982). There is however, an 
increasing awareness of the modulating role of system-specific attributes that lead to 
marked differences in the sensibility of the distinct estuarine systems (Cloern, 2001). The 
understanding of estuaries as physical, chemical and biological filters (Morris et al., 1995; 
Billen and Garnier, 1997; Cloern, 2001) enhances the importance of research programs that 
provide fundamental information on mechanistic models connecting biological processes 
and natural or human-related environmental variability.  

The understanding of the importance of planktonic bacterial and viral communities of 
the Ria de Aveiro, either as indicators of sanitary quality or as mediators of biological 
processes of self-purification, justified the development of some preliminary investigation 
on the dynamics of bacterioplankton and viral indicators of environmental contamination: 
Research Project JNICT 87/122 – Geographic variation and seasonal fluctuation of 
bacterial populations of the Ria de Aveiro (1987-1990); Research Project INIC-2H - 
Geographic variation and seasonal fluctuation of bacterial populations of the Ria de Aveiro 
II. Effects of toxic pollutants (1991-1992); Research Project ENVIREG – Study of the 
virological situation of the Ria de Aveiro and of the impacts of urban sewage effluents.  

The project Polaveiro - Microbiological and chemical quality of the water of Ria de 
Aveiro, corresponded to a combined effort of regular monitoring of biological and 
chemical indicators of water quality between 1989 and 1994. Even though the 
microbiological component of this study was focused on the evaluation of the seasonal and

geographic variability of bacterioplankton standing stocks and on the abundance of 
specific groups of bacterial indicators, it provided valuable information on the 
microbiology of the Ria and is still a reference for comparative analysis and assessment of 
anthropogenic impacts.  

The contribution of bacteria to total planktonic respiration and secondary biomass 
production can vary significantly between different systems but their importance generally 
increases with increasing eutrophication and organic loading (Hoppe et al., 1998). 
Bacterioplankton communities in the estuarine environment respond to changes in ambient 
temperature (Christian and Karl, 1995), salinity (Hoppe et al., 1996), concentration of 
particles (Fuks et al., 1991), light intensity (Pakulski et al., 1998), and general nutritional 
environment (Rath et al., 1993; Christian and Karl, 1995; Hoppe et al., 1998). Bacterial 
responses to changing water properties are generally stronger in terms of total and specific 
activity rates than in terms of abundance (Chin- Leo and Benner, 1992; del Giorgio et al., 
1996; Hoppe et al., 1996). Therefore, the high spatial and temporal variability within the 
estuarine environment should be expressed by marked shifts in the rates of biological 
processes mediated by the heterotrophic bacteria of the plankton.  

 
The general objective of this work was the understanding of the mechanisms of 

reactivity of estuarine bacterioplankton to short time and/or short distance variability of 
environmental factors at the boundaries of the estuarine system of Ria de Aveiro. Processes 
of polymer hydrolysis and monomer uptake were taken as a proxy to the potential role of 
bacterioplankton in the turnover of autochthonous and allochthonous organic matter within 
the estuary.  

The accomplishment of the general objective was attempted by specifically 
addressing the following questions: 

a) What are the relative contributions of superficial sediments and overlaying 
water to the mineralization of organic matter in a shallow estuarine system? 

b) How do the patterns of bacterioplankton degradation and recycling of 
organic matter respond to an estuarine gradient of changing environmental 
conditions? 

c) Can bacterioplankton from extreme estuarine sections adapt to changing 
environmental conditions to the point of evolving into functionally distinct 
communities or are the rates of heterotrophic processes mostly modulated by 
water properties? 

d) What is the contribution of particulate materials resuspended from bottom

sediments or washed out from the salt marshes to the reactivity of bacterial 
heterotrophic activities in the water column? 

e) How do bacterioplankton communities respond to marine influences at the 
interface with the sea and in what way do these responses affect the patterns 
of exchanges between the estuary and the ocean?

INTRODUCTION 
 
 

Bacterioplankton in the estuarine environment 
 

Bacteria have been recognized as a part of the plankton for approximately a century. 
The initial emphasis of research was set on the determination of the numbers of organisms 
and on the identification and physiological characterization of species that grew in the 
laboratory. Latter techniques allowed a more realistic estimation of bacterial abundance 
and brought new interest into the role of planktonic bacteria in the degradation and 
recycling of organic matter and as food sources for higher levels of pelagic food chains. 
During the last 20 years, important information on the contribution of bacterioplankton to 
biogeochemical cycles in diverse environments has allowed a better understanding of the 
complex net of variables that intervene in the regulation of bacterial dynamics. Molecular 
techniques are now being used to characterize the large unculturable fraction of species in 
the bacterioplankton communities. The integration of knowledge on bacterial physiology 
gathered from laboratory approaches with information on community composition and 
diversity obtained through culture- independent techniques will probably, in a near future, 
provide new insights into regulatory factors of bacterioplankton abundance and activity in 
nature. 
 
 
1. Bacterioplankton abundance and diversity 
 

Bacteria are the least variable component of plankton in terms of both total density 
and biomass (del Giorgio et al., 1996) contributing with approximately 20 % to total 
plankton biomass (Fuhrman et al., 1980; Williams, 1984). However, the density of 
communities of marine and estuarine bacterioplankton can vary considerably between 
distinct environments.  

The lower limit of the range of reported bacterial densities can be set by values below 
109 cells l-1, found in Arctic water (Ritzrau et al., 1997), in Eastern Antarctica (Leaky et 
al., 1996), in a cold temperate coastal Japanese lagoon (Sime-Ngando et al., 1999) or in 
marine water layers below the photic zone (Kuipers et al., 2000). At the upper limit of the 



Introduction 
 

 6 

range, bacterioplankton densities above 1010 cells l-1 have been observed in temperate 
estuarine systems (Shiah and Ducklow, 1994), tidal salt- marsh creeks (Shiah and Ducklow, 
1995) and coastal lagoons (Barbosa, 1991; Hoppe et al., 1996). 

In open oceanic waters, the variation of bacterial abundance defines clear vertical 
patterns characterised by the decrease of the community density below the photic zone 
(Künnis, 1991; Ritzrau et al., 1997; Kuipers et al., 2000), or below the thermocline (Gast 
and Gocke, 1988) and, on the contrary, some increase within the chemoclines at the 
interface between oxic and anoxic waters (Gast and Gocke, 1988; Karrasch and Hoppe, 
1991) and at the benthic boundary layer (Ritzrau et al., 1997; Drake et al., 1998).  

In estuaries, longitudinal patterns of variation often develop corresponding to a 
seaward decrease of bacterial abundance. Estuarine maxima are more often found at the 
upper (Palumbo and Fergusson, 1978) or mid (Wright and Coffin, 1983) estuarine sections. 
Similarly, bacterial abundance within estuarine plumes tends to decrease with increasing 
distance from shore (Fuhrman et al., 1980). Estuarine systems also exhibit strong short-
term temporal fluctuations of bacterioplankton abundance associated to tidal effects and 
generally characterised by increasing density of the communities in low tide, relatively to 
high tide (Shiah and Ducklow, 1995; Hoppe et al., 1996). 

The major factors involved in the regulation of bacterioplankton standing stocks may 
vary significantly, both seasonal and geographically. Strong positive relations with 
phytoplankton biomass are often found in costal environments (Väätänen, 1980; Ritzrau et 
al., 1997; Poremba et al., 1999; Fandino et al., 2001) but in estuaries bacterial growth may 
be uncoupled from phytoplankton biomass since nutrient supply is related to other sources 
rather than local primary production (Shiah and Ducklow, 1995; Hoppe et al., 1996; 
Zdanowski and Figueiras, 1999). 

Hydrographical variability driven by physical factors may significantly affect 
bacterial abundance. Zdanowski and Figueiras (1997) found that 60 % of the variability in 
the density of bacterial communities in surface waters of Ria de Vígo could be explained 
by physical factors such as solar radiation, water temperature, runoff or coastal upwelling. 
Temperature is probably the most referred controlling factor of bacterial standing stocks. 
The positive influence of increasing temperature on bacterial growth is expressed by 
increasing bacterial abundance during warm seasons (Kirstein, 1991) or by denser 
communities found above marine thermoclines (Künnis, 1991). Temperature limitation 
may even be stronger than nutrient limitation in the estuarine environment (Shiah and 
Ducklow, 1994; Shiah and Ducklow, 1995). The regulatory effect of temperature over 
community size is stronger on the free- living fraction whereas the proportion of particle-



Introduction 
 

 7 

attached cells is more related to the concentration of particulate matter (Unanue et al., 
1992; Crump et al., 1998). 

The effect of salinity on bacterial density in estuarine waters is sometimes referred as 
minor, compared to biological, physical and other chemical factors. However, negative 
relations between salinity and either total bacterioplankton abundance or, in particular, the 
particle-attached fraction, have been found in estuarine gradients (Väätänen, 1980; Valdés 
and Albright, 1981; Painchaud et al., 1987; Chin-Leo and Benner, 1992).  

Biological factors such as grazing or viral lysis may also assume relevant roles in the 
regulation of bacterioplankton standing stocks. Increased grazing-related bacterial 
mortality has been found in cold marine waters during austral summer (Leakey et al., 
1996) and at the lower limit of salinity gradients (Guixa-Boixareu et al., 1996) and the 
effects are more pronounced in the active fraction of the community, which is often 
coincident with the larger cell-size class (Gasol et al., 1995). Viral lysis has been cited as a 
mortality factor particularly important in the estuarine environment. It was found that 
aproximatly 40 % of estuarine bacteria are lysogenic and that lysis induction occurs more 
frequently in estuarine and coastal waters that in the offshore (Jiang and Paul, 1996). 

Concomitantly with geographic and temporal variations in the total numbers of cells, 
it has been demonstrated that significant shifts in the composition of bacterioplankton 
communities may occur. Culture- independent approaches to the composition of 
communities, such as the analysis of 16S rDN A sequences or fluorescence in situ 
hybridisation with specific oligonucleotide probes (FISH), show that the structure of 
bacterial assemblages may reflect changes in water column stability, depth, season or 
trophic status (Donner et al., 1996; Murray et al., 1998).  

The degree of bacterial diversity in estuarine environments is expected to be high due 
to the dynamic nature of these particular environments and to the inputs of colonised 
particles from various sources (Crump et al., 1999). Members of the essentially 
unculturable Cytophaga-Flavobacterium cluster compose one of the most abundant groups 
in marine ecosystems (Cottrell and Kirchman, 2000; Eilers et al., 2000; Pinhassi and 
Hagström, 2000). Contrastingly, members of the beta subclass of the Proteobacteria are 
mostly found in fresh water systems and members of the alpha and gamma subclasses of 
the Proteobacteria have been detected both in marine and in freshwater assemblages 
(Glöckner et al., 1999). 

The variability in the composition of bacterioplankton communities over small 
horizontal distances was found to be minimal (Murray et al., 1998) but significant 
differences between communities were found over larger geographic scales (Lee and 



Introduction 
 

 8 

Fuhrman, 1991; Murray et al., 1996; Hagström et al., 2000). Shifts in the composition of 
bacterioplankton communities have been related to seasonal fluctuations of abundance in 
coastal waters (Murray et al., 1998; Pinhassi and Hagström, 2000) and longitudinal 
profiles of bacterial abundance and activity along estuarine gradients (Murray et al., 1996). 
In vertical profiles along the water column, layers of increased turnover of organic matter 
are characterised by increased bacterial diversity (Höfle and Brettar, 1995) and marked 
shifts in community composition are also related to chemoclines (Donner et al., 1996; 
Ramsing et al., 1996). 

Culture- independent techniques have also been used to compare the free-living and 
the particle-attached estuarine bacterial communities. The contribution of particle-attached 
cells to total abundance can be rather variable but usually below 10 % (Almeida and 
Alcântara, 1992; Unanue et al., 1992; Fandino et al., 2001) and the proportion increases at 
the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) section (Crump et al., 1998). High-resolution 
electrophoresis of low molecular weight RNAs (5S rRNA and tRNA) showed that the 
particle-attached and the free- living communities of bacterioplankton of Chesapeake Bay 
were different in composition (Bidle and Fletcher, 1995). A similar conclusion was 
redrawn from terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (T-RFLP) of 
bacterioplankton from Eastern Mediterranean (Moeseneder et al., 2001). Results have also 
demonstrated that the particle-attached estuarine bacterial communities are geographically 
more stable in composition than free- living assemblages, which include a large fraction of 
bacterial groups also found in coastal or riverine waters (Crump et al., 1999; Hollibaugh et 
al., 2000). In this scenario, particle-attached bacterioplankton would be more 
representative of the “true” estuarine communities than the more variable free- living 
fraction. 
 
 
2. Bacterioplankton heterotrophic activity 
 
2.1. Substrate sources for estuarine heterotrophic bacterioplankton 

 
Estuaries are important sites for the degradation of terrestrial, riverine, oceanic and 

estuarine organic matter. Heterotrophic bacteria intervene in the processes of organic 
matter transformation within the planktonic compartment by performing two major 
functions: they respire organic compounds to inorganic forms and they incorporate organic 
matter into new bacterial biomass. 



Introduction 
 

 9 

The nutritional environment for estuarine bacteria is chemically complex, spatially 
heterogeneous and subject to temporal and geographic variations. Although seasonal 
variations of bacterioplankton abundance and activity are sometimes correlated with 
phytoplankton standing stocks with a lag time of a few weeks (Jonas and Tuttle, 1990) 
autochthonous phytoplankton primary production is often insufficient to supply the 
potential dema nd of estuarine bacterioplankton for organic forms of carbon and nitrogen 
(Jugnia et al., 1999; Bode et al., 2001; Almeida* et al., submitted).  

During warm periods, amino acid incorporation (Rosenstock and Simon, 1993) and 
bacterial biomass production (Chin- Leo and Benner, 1992) may exceed planktonic primary 
production and under low productivity and high estuarine flushing conditions material 
derived derived from higher plants gains relevance (Otero et al., 2000).  

Findlay et al. (1992) estimated that the amount of allochthonous carbon necessary to 
support bacterial productivity at the Hudson River estuary (USA) would correspond to 3-6 
times the net carbon fixation by phytoplankton. A similar carbon budget calculated for the 
Westerschelde estuary (The Nethe rlands) also shows a strong imbalance between auto- and 
heterotrophic processes with a yearly community respiration corresponding to 4-35 times 
the net production (Soetaert and Herman, 1995). However, experimental results indicate 
that phytoplankton-derived organic compounds are preferred as substrates for bacterial 
growth, producing the highest bacterial growth efficiencies (Cherrier et al., 1996). 

There is a general consensus around the preponderance of dissolved and polymeric 
substrates in aquatic environments (Chróst et al., 1989; Chróst, 1991). The concentration 
of simple molecules that can directly enter bacterial cells is often in the pico- nanomolar 
range (Chróst, 1991; Keil and Kirchman, 1999). In estuaries, the concentration of total 
amino acids, peptides, proteins and simple carbohydrates ranges from &amp;lt;10 µgC l-1 to 
several mgC l-1 (review by Pomeroy and Wiebe, 2001). 

Polysaccharides account for approximately 50% of marine dissolved organic matter 
(DOM) in surface waters but the proportion is reduced to half this value below the photic 
zone (Benner et al., 1992). Glucose may account for 50-80 % of the monosaccharide pool 
and supply for approximately 25 % of C-demand for bacterial biomass production in the 
ocean (Rich et al., 1996). It is estimated that neutral sugars and amino acids account for 
14% and 7% of marine DOM, respectively. These two classes of molecules are highly 
bioreactive and their selective removal from the water column by heterotrophic 
bacterioplankton may account for half the early consumption of organic carbon (Amon et 
al., 2001).

2.2. Ectoenzymatic activity and monomer uptake 

 
The general model of transference of organic matter to bacterial cells corresponds to 

a flux from polymeric to simple substrates that are later up taken by bacteria. The remote 
sources of DOM for heterotrophic bacterioplankton are particulate (algae, zooplankton, 
organic detritus, other bacterial cells) so, gradients of nutrient availability in aquatic 
environments are a common feature (Azam and Cho, 1987). These sources may provide 
substrates in a continuous manner or in pulses and the heterotrophic bacterioplankton must 
take advantage of gradients of nutrients and of intermittent periods of enhanced substrate 
inputs.  

Since only low-molecular-weight (LMW) compounds and simple molecules can be 
directly transferred from the environment into the cells, the first step of the DOM-bacteria 
pathway is dependent upon bacterial hydrolytic enzymes. Ectoenzymes develop their 
activity as close as possible to permeases in order to take maximum advantage of 
monomer-rich micro zones surrounding intense polymer degradation sites. Several 
experimental works have demonstrated that bacterial hydrolytic enzymes are physically 
bound to the cell surface or occur in the periplasmic space of gram- negative bacteria. 
Martinez and Azam (1993) found that approximately 30 % of aminopeptidase activity in a 
marine bacterium was associated to the cell-surface and 70 % was periplasmic. This is 
consistent with a model in which surface enzymes directly react with polymers and 
generate oligomers that diffuse into the periplasm. Further hydrolysis occurs in a high 
ectoenzymatic activity environment where monomers may directly interact with substrate-
binding proteins or with permeases (Martinez and Azam, 1993). Extracellular degradation 
of organic compounds has important implications in the processing of particulate 
substrates because the conversion of particles into solutes prevents substrates sources from 
sinking and being lost from the water column and makes them inaccessible to particle 
feeders (Azam and Cho, 1987). 

Coupling polymer hydrolysis and monomer uptake allows bacterioplankton to take 
maximum profit from punctual sources o DOM. This coupling is particularly tight in 
oligotrophic environments or during low productivity periods and the ratio between uptake 
and hydrolysis rates provides a measure of the pool size ratio between monomers and 
polymers (Hoppe et al., 1988). Considering that the relative importance of polymers 
increases with increasing eutrophication, uncoupling between hydrolysis and uptake can

occur during spring blooms (Middelboe et al., 1995) or in highly eutrophied coastal 
ecosystems (Hoppe et al., 1988).  

The co-existence of high and low affinity hydrolytic and uptake enzyma tic systems is 
one important strategy in the interaction of bacterioplankton and organic matter because it 
provides bacterioplankton communities with the metabolic flexibility to utilize low bulk-
phase concentrations of substrates and high nutrient concent rations in the vicinity of 
discrete sources of DOM (Hollibaugh and Azam, 1983; Tholosan et al., 1999; Unanue et 
al., 1999). The maintenance of distinct enzymatic systems allows rapid responses to shifts 
in substrate availability that are expressed by changes in the levels of per-cell activity rates 
(Wehr et al., 1999). Transition between systems occurs at different concentration ranges 
for different enzymes and is more pronounced for hydrolytic than for uptake systems 
(Unanue et al., 1999). Studies of biphasic kinetics in natural bacterioplankton assemblages 
show that the coupling between hydrolysis and uptake observed under low ambient 
concentrations of substrates corresponds to situations of high affinity hydrolytic 
ectoenzymes and low affinity uptake systems operating simultaneously (Unanue et al., 
1999). 

 
 

2.3. Environmental regulation of bacterial activity 
 
Environmental factors interact in the regulation of bacterioplankton activity in such a 

way that it is often difficult to discriminate between individual effects and to assess their 
relative contribution. 

Substrate availability and temperature interact in all bacterial communities, at 
different temperature and substrate concentration ranges (Psenner and Sommaruga, 1992; 
Jugnia et al., 1999; Pomeroy and Wiebe, 2001).  

Bacteria respond to changes in organic matter availability by shifting between levels 
of activity. As a general trend, increasing rates of bacterial biomass production, 
ectoenzymatic activity and uptake rates have been extensively reported during 
phytoplankton blooms (Chróst et al., 1989; Chróst, 1991; Middelboe et al., 1995), in the 
proximity of particulate sources of DOM (Martinez et al., 1996; Ritzrau et al., 1997; 
Tholosan et al., 1999; Grossart and Ploug, 2001) or along gradients of increasing 
eutrophication (Rath et al., 1993; Christian and Karl, 1995; Hoppe et al., 1998).  

Experimental addition of organic matter to bacterioplankton communities shows that 
responses are not only related to the concentration of available organic carbon but also to 



Introduction 
 

 12 

the quality of substrates. Terrestrial detritus were found to be relatively refractory whereas 
algal-derived material produces significant stimulation of growth (Wehr et al., 1999). 
Dissolved substrates produced stronger stimulation than particulate material of identical 
sources (Cherrier et al., 1996; Ferrier-Pagès et al., 2000).  

Monomer incorporation and ectoenzymatic activity measure different cellular 
processes. Uptake of simple substrates involves membrane transport and intracellular 
metabolic functions and is interpreted as an indicator of growth. Ectoenzymatic activity 
measures the expression of cell-bound enzymes and the potential for the hydrolysis of 
polymeric substrates that ultimately reflects the spectra of recent substrates to which 
bacteria have been exposed. Therefore, additions of simple substrates may trigger distinct 
responses of these two metabolic indicators. Additions of monosaccharides and amino 
acids stimulate monomer uptake (Berman et al., 1994) but decrease ectoenzymatic activity 
rates either by end-product inhibition or by catabolic repression (Chróst, 1991). 

In the estuarine environment bacterial growth is generally not limited by carbon 
availability but rather by nitrogen (Chin- Leo and Benner, 1992). In oligotrophic waters 
bacteria compete with phytoplankton for dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) whereas in 
eutrophic waters they mineralise dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) to DIN (Jørgensen et 
al., 1999). Dissolved free amino acids and ammonia are the dominant N sources for 
bacterial growth (Jørgensen et al., 1999; Middelburg and Nieuwenhuize, 2000) but the 
hydrolysis of dissolved combined amino acids (DCAA) coupled to amino acid uptake can 
support approximately 50% of bacterial nitrogen demand and 25% of the carbon demand 
in estuarine and coastal waters (Keil and Kirchman, 1999). 

The regulatory effect of temperature on bacterial metabolism may prevail over 
nutrient supply during the cold season (Shiah and Ducklow, 1995) or in stratified 
environments (Patel et al., 2000) and generally bacterial activity rates are positively 
correlated with temperature (Christian and Karl, 1995; Simon and Wünsch, 1998; Patel et 
al., 2000). One important indirect effect of temperature is that it affects the affinity of 
enzymatic systems. Under low temperature the affinity of enzymatic systems decreases 
significantly and labile substrates may accumulate in the environment because they 
become less bioavailable (Zweifel, 1999; Pomeroy and Wiebe, 2001). 

Salinity generally correlates poorly with bacterioplankton metabolic activity 
measures in estuarine bacterioplankton (Murrell et al., 1999) and since in estuaries salinity 
gradients also correspond to trophic gradients, individual effects become difficult to 
interpret. A relatively high salinity optimum (30 PSU) was reported for ? -glucosidase  
(E.C. 3.2.21) activity in intertidal sediments (King, 1986) but the potential activity of the 



Introduction 
 

 13 

same ectoenzyme was negatively related to salinity in coastal waters (Murrell et al., 1999). 
The relation between leucine-aminopeptidase (E.C. 3.4.11) activity and salinity in coastal 
systems was found to be positive in some environments (Murrell et al., 1999) and negative 
in others (Hoppe et al., 1996; Pattel et al., 2000). Strong decreases of monomer uptake 
with increasing salinity have also been observed (Valdés and Albright, 1981; Hoppe et al., 
1996). 

Light is generally not among the major factors controlling estuarine bacterioplankton 
activity rates. However photo inhibition of thymidine and leucine uptake was observed in a 
shallow coastal system (Pakulski et al., 1998). Contrastingly, the photodegradation of 
recalcitrant DOM into more labile compounds has been related to the stimulation of the 
growth of marine bacterioplankton populations (Benner and Biddanda, 1998). Light 
intensity also influences rates of primary production and therefore causes indirect effects 
on the availability of substrates for bacterial growth and influences the outcome of the 
competition between phyto- and bacterioplankton for inorganic nutrients (Sanford et al., 
2001). These indirect effects of light and the concomitant variations in the concentration of 
organic and inorganic nutrients may originate diel rhythms of variation of bacterial activity 
rates in environments where primary production and bacterial organic matter utilization are 
tightly coupled (Gasol et al., 1998; Kormas et al., 1998; Kuipers et al., 2000). 

 
 

2.4. Bacterioplankton dynamics at estuarine boundaries  
 
The water column of estuarine systems is physically and functionally connected to 

the terrestrial, riverine and oceanic environments and establishes also tight relations with 
intertidal margins. Bacterioplankton experiences spatial and temporal variations according 
to the intensity of environmental pressure at these interfaces. 

 
The benthic boundary  
Resuspension of bottom sediments caused by tidal currents, wind- induced waves or 

anthropogenic disturbance is an important process of exchange of materials between the 
benthic and the planktonic compartments in shallow coastal systems (Demers et al., 1987; 
Trousselier et al., 1993; Sloth et al., 1996).  

The susceptibility to resuspension is subjected to seasonal and geographic 
fluctuations in relation to sediment texture and microphytobenthic colonization (de Jonge 
and van den Bergs, 1987). Experimental results show that the critical current speed 



Introduction 
 

 14 

increases considerably in fine sediments highly colonised by diatoms when compared to 
sandy sediments with low microphytobenthic biomass (Lucas et al., 2000). 

Pulses of nutrients associated to resuspension events result in increased rates of 
heterotrophic activity of bacteria in the adjacent water column. Experimental disturbance 
of benthic sediments in either flume or mesocosm experiments produced significant 
increases of bacterial abundance, biomass productivity and potential ectoenzymatic activity 
(Wainright, 1987; Chróst and Riemann, 1994; Sloth et al., 1996). 

The superimposition of tidally- induced sediment resuspension, salinity-related 
flocculation of riverine materials and density gradients, results in the maintenance of 
suspended particles inside the estuaries and in the occurrence of estuarine turbidity maxima 
(Vale and Sundby, 1982; Brenon and Le Hir, 1999). These estuarine sections are 
characterised by high rates of bacterial activity (Fuks et al., 1991) and by an increase in the 
contribution of particle-attached bacteria to total activity rates (Griffith et al., 1990; Crump 
et al., 1998; Hollibaugh and Wong, 1999; Murrell et al., 1999). Attachment to particles 
also prevents estuarine planktonic bacteria from being washed out of a favourable 
nutritional environment (Murrell et al., 1999). 

Processes of transference between sediments and the water column under low current 
velocities are mostly driven by salinity gradients and involve exchanges of solutes rather 
than particulate materials. Differences of salinity between interstitial and overlaying water 
cause the density displacement and advection of solutes from estuarine sediments into the 
water column (von Bodungen et al., 1995; Webster et al., 1996). Bacterioplankton growing 
in water experimentally exposed to sediments showed higher biomass production rates and 
the stimulation corresponded to a net flux of DOM from the sediments to the water column 
(Hopkinson et al., 1998; Middelboe et al., 1998). Field results also show that bacterial 
abundance and activity at the water layer directly above the sediment are higher that at the 
intermediate layer in open ocean waters (Ritzrau et al., 1997) or than in surface waters of 
shallow estuarine systems (Goosen et al., 1995) suggesting that benthic-derived substrates 
may fuel heterotrophic activity in the water column. 

 
 
The fresh-water boundary 
Variations of the fresh-water fluxes are one of the major factors of seasonal control 

of estuarine biological activity (Cloern and Nichols, 1985). High inputs of particulate 
materials occur during periods of elevated fresh-water fluxes (Otero et al., 2000) and the 
nutritional quality of seston (Murrell et al., 1999), as well as the contribution of 



Introduction 
 

 15 

phytoplankton and bacterial biomass to total particulate organic carbon (POC), 
(Hollibaugh and Wong, 1999) decrease during dry periods. Plant-derived material 
transported by rivers may assume a dominant role as source of organic carbon for estuarine 
heterotrophs during periods of low autochthonous production (Otero et al., 2000). Fresh-
water flow, taken as a proxy for organic matter flux, was positively correlated with several 
bacterioplankton metabolic indicators such as ectoenzymatic activity, monomer uptake, 
growth rates and growth efficiency (Benner et al., 1995; Murrell et al., 1999). 

Upper sections of estuarine systems also receive inputs of fresh-water bacterial 
communities. Although their growth may experience some stimulation at the upper 
estuarine sections, the increase of salinity causes sharp decrease of monomer uptake 
(Valdés and Albright, 1981) and growth rates (Painchaud et al., 1995). 

 
 
The inter-tidal boundary 
Salt marshes and mud- flats are generally considered as estuarine compartments of 

enhanced primary production (Buzzelli et al., 1999; Serôdio and Catarino, 2000) and 
respiration rates (Taylor and Allanson, 1995; Cai et al., 1999). Exchanges of materials 
between the estuarine margins and the water column result from cyclic flooding and 
exposure of sediments in relation to tidal currents.  

Early attempts to assess the relative contribution of salt-marshes as sources of 
organic matter to adjacent coastal waters led to the formulation of the “outwelling 
hypothesis” according to which considerable amounts of materials would be exported from 
the salt- marshes to the main estuarine water body (Odum, 1968; Dame et al., 1986). More 
recently, the exchange of particulate forms of organic carbon and dissolved forms of 
inorganic nitrogen between the littoral zone and main estuarine channel has been 
demonstrated in shallow estuarine ecosystems (Buzzelli et al., 1999). However, salt-
marshes are found to act predominatly as sinks for particulate matter whereas they export 
DOM forms (Taylor and Allanson, 1995). When respiration rates are high, the exports to 
the water column are dominated by inorganic respiratory products (Cai et al., 1999) and 
inorganic forms of nitrogen and phosphorus that are used by phyto- and bacterioplankton 
(Heinle and Flemer, 1976). 

 
 
The ocean boundary

activity rates are often related to patterns of variation with distinct periodicity. The 
decrease in abundance and activity of estuarine bacterioplankton during the flood-tide is a 
feature of tidal estuaries (Kirchman et al., 1984; Hoppe et al., 1996; Cunha et al., 2000). 
However, field results often show that the tidal-associated variations of abundance and 
activity within the bacterial communities of the water column cannot be fully explained by 
conservative dilution effects suggesting that bacterial cells react also in terms of the levels 
of individual activity (Hoppe et al., 1996; Cunha et al., 2000).  

Fortnight cycles of spring- neap tides affect the vertical mixture of the water column 
and the longitudinal extension of the estuarine turbidity maximum (Murrell et al., 1999), 
therefore influencing the supply or organic and inorganic nutrients and the relations 
between phytoplankton and bacterioplankton biomass production.  

Seasonal variations on the direction and intensity of coastal winds and on oceanic 
upwelling conditions also shape biological gradients at the estuary-ocean boundary (Cloern 
and Nichols, 1985). Coastal upwelling was positively associated with the  colony- forming 
bacterioplankton fraction (Zdanowski and Figueiras, 1999) and since it changes the degree 
of mixing of the water column and the supply of nutrients, upwelling may shift the 
limitations of bacterioplankton growth from organic to inorganic sources (Kirchman et al., 
2000). 

Estuarine plumes correspond to estuarine-ocean interfaces of elevated standing stocks 
of phyto- and bacterioplankton (Malone and Ducklow, 1990) as well as intense 
heterotrophic activity (Robertson et al., 1998; Jørgenson e t  al., 1999; Pakulski et al., 
2000). Bacterial activity along estuarine gradients and transition zones considerably alters 
the size and quality of the DOM pool that ultimately reaches oceanic waters (Raymond and 
Bauer, 2000).  

The specific biological attributes of the marine- influenced lower sections of estuarine 
systems and the dynamics of heterotrophic bacterioplankton within the plume zone may act 
as filters and considerably attenuate the effects of coastal eutrophication (Morris et al., 
1995; Billen and Garnier, 1997; Cloern, 2001).

_________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
Abstract - Oxygen consumption rates were determined, in parallel with primary production and bacterial 
biomass production, as an approach to the analysis of carbon cycling in the estuarine community of the Ria 
de Aveiro. The water column of the marine zone was the major contributor (64-99 %) for the total aerobic 
carbon remineralisation in which O2 uptake rates averaged from 80 to 127 mgO2m

-2h-1, respectively at low tide 
and high tide. The planktonic consumption of O2 varied from 0.010 to 0.041 mg O2l

-1h-1 with the highest values 
in the brackish zone. Small water column depths in this zone reduced, however, the integrated average 
consumption of the plankton, per surface unit, to 57 % (LT) and 66 % (HT) of that observed in the marine 
zone. Benthic O2 consumption rates, 5.1 to 22.0 mgO2m

-2h-1, were 2 to 4 times higher in the brackish zone when 
compared to the rates in the marine zone. It represented 1 to 31% of the total surface integrated values in 
different areas and at different tides. From the ratios of the primary production and bacterial biomass 
production, on a per surface unit basis, it is concluded that, in late autumn, the Ria de Aveiro was mostly an 
heterotrophic system with a feeble recover of primary production at HT in the marine zone and at LT in the 
brackish water zone. 

 
 

Key words : estuary, oxygen consumption, bacterial respiration, sediment respiration, bacterial

1. Introduction  
 

In estuarine systems, autochthonous and allochthonous organic matter are transported and 
deposited in different geographical patterns, stimulating respiration in the water column and in the 
benthos. The partition of the aerobic metabolism among the different spatial compartments and 
physiological groups in the community is an important tool for the evaluation of the estuarine 
carbon cycle. 

The sediment-water interface is a site of intense heterotrophic activity where nutrients are 
generated, percolated into the sediment and diffused out to the water column. It gives support to 
bacterial populations, which are 2-3 orders of magnitude more dense than in the water column 
(Alcântara et al., 1996). 



Compartments of oxygen consumption  
 

 18 

The determination of the metabolic pattern of an ecosystem on the basis of oxygen uptake 
is relatively simple (Hargrave, 1969; Fallon and Boylen, 1990) and can be directly applied to the 
water column and to the sediments, at quasi in situ conditions (Gocke et al., 1981; Roos and 
Eriksen, 1995). Although the Winkler titration method is criticised, particularly when used in 
cases of low rates of respiration (Pamatmat, 1997), the method is still considered valuable in a 
community approach. 

Community respiration represents the transfer of carbon between the organic and inorganic 
reservoirs of a system. The subtraction of bacterial respiration from autotrophic production, gives 
a direct estimate of the organic carbon available for export in the system or incorporation by non-
bacterial consumers (Yahnke and Craven, 1995). Community respiration defines limits to the 
overall partition of bacterial metabolism of dissolved organic carbon in secondary production of 
biomass and aerobic respiration (Yahnke and Craven, 1995). 

The system variation in the rate of O2 consumption involves seasonal fluctuation, with 
maxima in summer, of the respiration rate of planktonic bacteria as was observed in the 
continental shelf (Grifith and Pomeroy, 1995). Estuarine sediments also show mineralization 
seasonality (Hargrave, 1969; Mallo et al., 1993) due to changing temperature and organic 
loading variation, but this fluctuation is not common to other marine systems, specially to those 
affected by low concentrations of dissolved oxygen (Conley et al., 1997). Positive effects of 
benthic bioturbation on the rate of O2 consumption are frequent and probably due to activation of 
the bacterial community (Hansen and Kristensen, 1997). 

Aerobic respiration in coastal sediments is limited by oxygen penetration due to the 
resistance of the diffusive boundary layer to the flux of O2 (Yørgensen and Revsberg, 1985). The 
penetration is variable with the composition of the sediment but, generally, it is restricted to a few 
millimetres. 

The profiles of respiratory and production activities in estuaries are shaped by many 
environmental factors including those related to the short-term tidal changes in water properties. 

This work intends to establish preliminary values for the rates of biotic mineralisation and 
carbon fixation in the marine and brackish water zones of the Ria de Aveiro. It is also directed to 
the determination of the relative contributions of the different compartments, namely plankton and 
benthos, to the total oxidation of organic carbon within this ecosystem.

Samples were collected in 1997/98 along two transects defined one in the marine zone at 
the main navigation channel (transect N1) and other in the inner brackish water section of the 
estuary (transect I6) (Fig.1). Transect I6 was visited on the 28th October (low tide) and on the 7th 
November (high tide). Samples from transect N1 were collected on the 16th December (low tide) 
and on the 9th January (high tide). All samples were collected under spring tide conditions. 

Along each transect 5 equidistant subtidal stations were defined and further identified by 
their relative position: stations South, South-Centre, Centre, North-Centre and North at transect 
N1 and stations West, West-Centre, Centre, East-Centre and East at transect I6. 

For the determination of the rate of 
oxygen consumption two cores of sediment 
plus overlaying water were collected by scuba 
divers from each station directly into 
cylindrical respiration chambers (14 cm in 
diameter and 8 cm high) similar to those used 
by Gocke et al. (1981). The closed 
chambers were immediately immersed in 
water from the station and transported to the 
laboratory. Water from the bottom layer of 
the water column (0.5 m from sediment 
surface) was collected on boat with a Niskin 
bottle for later adjustments and preparation of 
the respiration chambers. In the laboratory the 
water from the station was allowed to flow 
through the chambers before taking the first 
sample for determination of the initial oxygen 
concentration. The completely filled chambers 
were sealed and incubated at in situ 
temperature for 5-7 hours. BOD bottles were 
also filled with bottom water for determination 
of planktonic respiration. Total aerobic 
respiration (sediment plus water oxygen 
consumption per m2) was calculated from the 
values of respiration (per volume) in the 

Figure 1: Ria de Aveiro, a coastal estuarine 
ecosystem. Sampling transects (N1, marine zone and 
I6, brackish zone) are indicated with arrows.

chambers and in the water bottles, taking into account the total depth of the station, and the 
surface area of the sediment in the chamber. 

The sediments used for respiration assays were later used for granulometric analysis after 
treatment with 100 V hydrogen peroxide and 20 % sodium pyrophosphate, according to the 
categories used by Rodrigues and Quintino (1985). Organic matter content was determined 
through loss of dry weight after 48 hours treatment with 100 V hydrogen peroxide.  

For the determination of physical, chemical and microbiological parameters of the water 
column, only the 3 stations corresponding to the margins and to the centre of the channel were 
studied. At transect N1 (total depth of 2.0-20.6 m at HT and 2.5-12.3 m at LT) the water 
samples were collected at surface (0.2 m from surface) and bottom (0.5 m from de sediment-
water interface) layers of the water column but at the shallower transect I6 (total depth of 1.7-3.0 
m at HT and 0.3-1.8 m at LT), bottom samples were worth collecting only at the centre of the 
channel. 

Bacterial biomass productivity was determined according to Simon and Azam (1989) after 
addition of a saturating concentration of 30 nM 3H-leucine. Samples were incubated at in situ 
temperature for 1 hour. The metabolism of glucose was determined by the radioisotopic 
technique (Gocke, 1977) with a tracing concentration of 14C-glucose (43 nM) and after 2 hours 
of incubation at in situ temperature. Percentage of glucose respiration was calculated as the ratio 
between the respired fraction and the total uptake of glucose (sum of respired and incorporated 
fractions). Primary production was determined by incorporation of 14C-bicarbonate (Steemann-
Nielsen, 1952) in simulated in situ conditions. All radioactive substrates were purchased from 
Amersham. 

Salinity, temperature and dissolved oxygen were determined in the field with WTW 
equipment.  

 
 

3. Results 
 

A brief characterisation of the marine and brackish-water zones of the Ria de Aveiro can 
be derived from the values of salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, granulometry and organic 
content of the sediments at, respectively, transects N1 and I6 (Tables 1 and 2). In the marine 
zone, the average values of salinity at the surface water for the 3 sampling stations of the transect 
were 33.3 UPS at HT and 23.0 UPS at LT, while at the brackish-water zone the corresponding 
values were 27.4 and 19.1 UPS. Temperature values determined at transect I6 were higher than 
at transect N1. Temperature at surface (average values from 3 stations in each transect) was, at

Transect N1 is included in the deeper zone of the Ria with maximal HT water depth values 
of 20.6 m at the north-centre station. The average water depth (considering 5 stations) at this 
transect was, however, 9.3 m at HT and 6.3 m at LT. Average depth (from 5 sampling stations) 
at transect I6 was 2.2 m at HT and 1.2 m at LT. 

The granulometry of the sub-tidal sediments of the two transects did not differ drastically 
(Table 2). The coarser type of sediment (very coarse sand) was found at the north-centre station 
of transect N1 and at the west station of transect I6 and the finer (fine sand) correponded to the 
east margin of transect I6. The organic matter content of the sediments was higher at transect I6 
where it reached an average value (5 stations) of 2.9 % of the dry weight, compared to 0.8 % in 
transect N1. 

At transect I6, the aerobic respiration of the benthos was more intensive and quite stable in 
contrasting tidal conditions. The average values of O2 consumption were 22.0 and  
21.3 mgO2m

-2h-1 at HT and LT, respectively. In the marine zone the average values of respiration 
in the sediment were 5.1 and 13.8 mgO2m

-2h-1, respectively at HT and LT.

consumption to carbon released.

Planktonic respiration values are shown in Figures 2B and 3B. The averages of O2 

consumption at transect I6 were 0.030 and 0.041 mgO2l
-1h-1, respectively at LT and HT. In the 

marine zone the values decreased to 0.010 and 0.014 mgO2l
-1h-1, at corresponding tides. 

Taking into consideration the total depth of the water column at each station, the 
calculations show that the respiration in the planktonic compartment amounted, in average and as 
a fraction of total consumption, to 69 % in the brackish zone and to 87 % in the marine zone 
(Figures 2B and 3B). 

Primary production showed to be more intense at the brackish water zone. Average values 
at transect I6 were 4.0 and 4.5 mgCm-2h-1 respectively at HT and at LT while at transect N1 the 
average values decreased to 1.5 and 3.5 mgCm-2h-1 at corresponding tidal conditions (Table 3).  

The values of bacterial biomass productivity and of the fraction of respired glucose indicate 
the occurrence of higher levels of bacterial activity at the brackish water transect (Figures 2C and 
3C). The average values of bacterial biomass productivity at the surface of the water column 
across this transect (average of 3 stations) were 5.1 and  
5.7 µgCl-1h-1, respectively at LT and HT. The respired fraction of the absorbed glucose 
corresponded to 10.0 and 39.2 % in the corresponding tides. The highest rates of bacterial 
activity at the transect N1 were observed at LT. The average bacterial biomass productivity at 
the surface of the water column was here 0.9 µgCl-1h-1 at LT and 0.3 µgCl-1h-1 at HT. Glucose 
respiration determined on surface samples amounted to 13.2 % of the total uptake at HT and to 
5.9 % at LT. 

 
 

4. Discussion 
 

The lack of detailed bathymetric and hydrological data on the Ria de Aveiro, as well as of a 
more extensive work on the activity of the community, precludes more precise calculations of the 
integrated values of biological activity throughout this system. Even so, the results already 
obtained in this work, regarding the marine and brackish water zones, allow a first approach to 
the geographical and compartment distribution of carbon cycling in this system. 



Compartments of oxygen consumption

The rate of oxygen consumption determined, in a per volume unit basis, in the water column 
of the Ria de Aveiro varied from 10 to 41 µgO2l

-1h-1 (Table 4), values which are within the range 
of results published for marine systems. These include a range of  
35-47 µgO2l

-1h-1 in the water of mangrove swamps (Gocke et al., 1981) and of  
2.7 – 13.3 µgO2l

-1h-1 in marine water (Kruse, 1993). The values of total consumption of O2 
observed in the water column of the Ria de Aveiro range from 2 to 247 mgO2m

-2h-1  
(Table 4) and from values of 48 to 5928 mgO2m

-2d-1. These high respiration values, indicating 
eutrophication conditions, are similar to the range of 9 to 289 mmolO 2m

-2d-1  
(288-9248 mgO2m

-2d-1) reported by Caffrey et al. (1998) during a spring phytoplankton bloom 
in south San Francisco Bay.

(1) The marine zone is represented by station N1 and the brackish zone is represented by station I6.

Oxygen consumption was 3 times higher in the brackish water zone due to increased 

respiration of benthos and plankton. However, the differences in the depth of the water column in 
the two zones reversed the relation of the integrated values (per surface unit). The total rate of O2 
consumption in the water compartment of the marine zone is, in fact, 1.4-1.5 times higher than in 
the brackish water zone. 

Table 5 shows the oxygen uptake rates determined in sediments from freshwater and 
marine systems, with indication of the method of determination. Our values for the system of the 
Ria de Aveiro (15-1474 mgO2m

sediments (15-2500 mgO2m

The rate of the benthic O2 consumption per surface area unit was 1.5 to 4.3 times higher in 
the brackish zone, probably due to the relative increase in the organic matter content. This 
difference is even greater when it is taken into account the average thickness of the aerobic layer 
of the sediments (0.04 m in the marine zone and 0.01 m in the brackish water zone) (Alcântara et 
al., 1996). In fact, the surface layer of the sediment respired, in a per volume basis of aerobic 
sediment, 6 (LT) and 17 (HT) times more intensely in the brackish zone than in the marine zone 
(Table 4). The wide range of values of community respiration observed along each transect 
reflects differences in water depth (contribution of planktonic respiration) between sampling 
stations, differences in sediment characteristics and may also be related to changes in the density 
of zoobenthos. 

The subtidal sediments of the brackish zone of the Ria showed stable rates of oxygen 
consumption in relation to the tidal currents. The same did not happen in the marine zone, which 
exhibited 2.7 increases in the average transect values at low tide. This could be due to tidal 
differences in the bottom hydrodynamism (Hansen and Kristensen, 1997) and to short term 
instability in the organic content of the interface, associated or not with the deposition of organic 
loads transported from the brackish zone during ebb tide. 

Estuarine sediments are considered as a privileged compartment for the accumulation, 
deposition and mineralisation of locally produced and transported organic matter. The sediments 
of the Ria de Aveiro were 9 to 71 times more active than the water, in a per volume basis. The 
rates of oxygen consumption per surface area showed, however, that aerobic mineralisation runs 
mostly in the water column, with a relative share of 64-99 % (marine zone) and 37-95 % 
(brackish zone) of the total. This distribution of O2 consumption relative to the sediment and 
water compartments was also observed in other systems (Gocke et al., 1981; Madenjian, 1990; 
Sand-Jensen et al., 1990; Roos and Eriksen, 1995) and is indicative of high content of labile 
organic matter in the water column. 

The low values of the rate of O2 consumption, in a per volume basis, in estuarine water did 
not allow its fractionation according to plankton size, and, in particular, to bacterioplankton as 
was intended. Anyhow, one could see that the values of bacterial respiration relative to total 
uptake of glucose (Figures 2C and 3C), agree with a more intense bacterial mineralisation, in a 
per volume unit basis, at the brackish zone and, in general, at low tide.  



Compartments of oxygen consumption

Bacterial biomass productivity, determined as the rate of leucine incorporation, was taken 
as an index of metabolic activity of the bacterioplankton in spite of the degree of uncertainty 
involved. The high values observed at the brackish zone are in agreement with the general pattern 
of activities within the estuary. Our range of values considering all the individual stations at the 
marine and brackish-water zones (0.05-5.7 µgCl-1h-1), fits within the range of some published 
results (0.6-31 µgCl-1h-1) for productivity in coastal systems (Biddanda et al., 1994; Jellett et al., 
1996) with the exception of the relatively rare lower limit. The ratios of the productivity of 
bacterial biomass in the two zones (brackish/marine) of this ecosystem are 5.6 at low tide and 
21.0 at high tide. These values reflect the fact, already denoted (results for publication), that the 
productivity of the bacterial community originating from the marine zone is not immediately 
stimulated after transport to the brackish zone during flood tide. On the contrary, the brackish 
zone bacterial community moved to the the marine zone at ebb tide can increase local productivity 
by 237 % at the surface water. 

The overall estimates of oxygen consumption rates for the Ria de Aveiro are 115 (HT) and 
70 (LT) mgO2m

-2h-1 (Table 4). These values take into account the higher weight of the brackish 
zones in the total subtidal area (65 % at LT; 78 % at HT) of the Ria (Silva, 1994). 

In this system, and on a per surface unit basis, the aerobic carbon oxidation in daylight 
exceeded 5-9 times the carbon fixation by primary producers. This is an indication of large inputs 
of allochthonous labile organic carbon. Primary production in the Ria  
(4.3-23.2 gCm-2y-1) compares well with production in other coastal systems  
(25-45 gCm-2y-1, reviewed by Sherr and Sherr, 1996) but is at the lower end of the range for 
more productive estuaries (19.7-2394 gCm-2y-1, calculated from Cadée, 1986). 

Bacterial metabolism of glucose revealed that only a minor fraction (less than 40%) was 
respired. However, the evaluation of the total microbial respiration in the water column gives an 
altogether different picture. Aerobic respiration exceeded (up to 58 times) bacterial biomass 
productions, denoting either a general unbalance of bacterial metabolism in favour of 
mineralisation or/and a small contribution of the bacterial population for the total respiration. It is 
generally accepted, however, that in estuarine and coastal waters the respiration rates are mainly 
determined by the bacterial community (Grifith and Pomeroy, 1995) and that the importance of 
this fraction declines with the distance to the coast (Hopkinson, et al., 1989). The separation of 
bacteria from the total community is not easy or exempt of criticism and was not attempted in this 
study. The values of the total community respiration in unfractionated samples may reflect the 
importance of interbacterial DOC cycling as discussed by Yahnke and Craven (1995). 

The ratio between primary production and bacterial biomass production at LT and HT 
reveals the intensity of the shifts towards autotrophy or heterotrophy in dependence of tide. 



Compartments of oxygen consumption  
 

 28 

According to our results, in a per volume basis, referring to late autumn and winter conditions 
(values not shown), the ratio at LT in the marine (1.0) and brackish water (2.1) zones 
corresponded to a state of equilibrium between autotrophy and heterotrophy in the first zone and 
to a slight dominance of autotrophy in the upper estuary. At HT, however, this ratio shifted in 
opposite directions in the two zones. It increased to 3.3 in the marine zone (mainly due to the 
decrease in bacterial biomass productivity) and decreased to 0.4 in the brackish water zone (due 
to the increase in bacterial biomass productivity and the decrease in primary productivity). 

In a previous study of the Ria de Aveiro (Hoppe et al., 1996), during spring, this ratio was 
always equal or greater than 4 (4 to 22) in the two zones, denoting the importance of primary 
productivity in this season. According to these authors, at HT, the ratio exceeded the values at LT 
by a factor of 3 in the marine zone in a trend similar to that observed during the cold season. Also 
at HT, but in the brackish water zone, the trend was, however, reversed in relation to our results, 
showing a 5 times increase in the ratio (due to an enormous increase in primary productivity not 
observed in the cold season). 

During daylight, the shifts towards autotrophy and heterotrophy of the water column, in this 
estuarine system, are not only tide dependent but seem to be also season dependent. In the 
marine zone, enhanced heterotrophy happened at LT particularly in the cold season. On the 
contrary, in the same season, the upper estuary was mostly heterotrophic only at HT.

PATTERNS OF ECTOENZYMATIC AND HETEROTROPHIC BACTERIAL 
ACTIVITIES ALONG A SALINITY GRADIENT  

IN A SHALLOW TIDAL ESTUARY

Abstract - Bacterial heterotrophic communities play dominant roles in the transference of organic matter 
between compartments of estuarine ecosystems and, ultimately, between estuaries and the open sea. In this 
scenario, we investigated the responses of inflowing limnetic bacteria to the salinity gradient and the 
influence of this patterns on the degradation and recycling of organic matter in the Ria de Aveiro. 
Phytoplankton biomass was maximal (0.65-2.10 mgC l-1) in the mid- or inner-estuary and declined sharply at 
about 30 PSU. Bacterial communities reached highest densities in the mid and inner sections of the estuary 
(up to 15.3 x109 cell l-1), being 2 -3 times higher than in the outer estuary at identical t idal conditions. 
The rates of ectoenzymatic hydrolysis were also maximal at the mid -estuary or at the inner section. Values 
ranged from 4.3 to 181.3 nmol l-1 h-1 for ? -glucosidase and from 490 to 5374 nmol l-1 h-1 for Leu-
aminopeptidase. At the transition from the limnetic environment to the main body of the lagoon an 
exceptional increase in the utilisation of carbohydrate was observed (? -glucosidase activity). This was 
accompanied by major amplifications of glucose incorporation with maximal values of 17.7 nmol l-1 h-1. Tr 
ranged from 0.3 -4.1 % h-1 at the outer estuarine section increasing towards maximal values at the inner 
section (10.4-39.4 % h -1). 
Statistical analysis revealed that the variation of ectoenzymatic activities could be significantly related to 
bacterial abundance, which, in turn, was highly associated to the variation of salinity, temperature and 
chlorophyll a. 
Within the salinity gradient, the profiles of bacterial abundance, glucose uptake and ectoenzymatic activity 
generally agreed with a curvilinear pattern with a peak at about 25-30 PSU. Ectoenzymatic activity showed a 
quite conservative behaviour during tidal transport along the salinity gradient when compared to the more 
reactive parameters of glucose metabolism.

1. Introduction 
 

Estuaries are transition systems governed by complex interacting elements that 
change in space and with season. When subjected to tidal currents, the entire estuary 
acquires a pulsation that interferes with the transport and expression of biological activities 
and with the distribution of biomass in the water column. One can, however, assess the 



Patterns of heterotrophic activity  
 

 34 

metabolic structure by locating the main sources of nutrients and of organic carbon and by 
determining the potential for autotrophic and heterotrophic growth as well as the potential 
of mineralisation. 

Allochthonous carbon sources, in accretion to the elevated primary production 
generally observed in estuaries, tend to enhance the heterotrophic component in the 
metabolism of the plankton in disfavour of autotrophy. In different estuaries of the Iberian 
Peninsula, for example, it was observed that the external source of total organic carbon 
(TOC) was much larger tha n primary production (Vallespinós and Mallo, 1990). 
Microheterotrophs, especially bacteria, are the only biological populations capable of 
significantly altering both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon 
(POC) (Chróst, 1990) developing, in this way, a great impact in the cycle of matter and in 
the energy flux. These processes require extensive extracellular substrate hydrolysis by 
different ectoenzymes, activities that play a key role in microbial ecology (Hoppe, 1991, 
Vetter et al., 1998). The importance of the ectoenzymatic activity is brought to evidence by 
the coupling to the decomposition of POC and DOC during seasonal and spatial 
fluctuations of activity (Chróst, 1990).  

The variation in ectohydrolase profiles (types and levels of activity) along an 
estuarine trophic gradient reflects the trophic status of the environment and this changes 
with the season (Hoppe et al., 1998, Karner et al., 1992). It has been argued that such 
variations could be caused by shifts in the dominant species or in the level of enzyme 
expression by the same species in response to changes in the field of organic matter 
(Martinez et al., 1996) 

Generally, the Ria de Aveiro, is dominated by microbial heterotrophic processes not 
only in a diel scale, but probably all over the year (Hoppe et al., 1996). In the warm 
season, during the daylight period, the balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy, 
judged from the ratio of primary production and bacterial production, shifted towards clear 
net autotrophy, particularly at high tide (Hoppe et al., 1996). In the cold season, however, 
even during daylight, low tide only allowed a general equilibrium of the two activities in 
the inner and outer estuary sections (Cunha et al., 1999).  

In face of the observed importance of heterotrophy in the lagoon of Aveiro, it is now 
attempted to put in evidence the patterns of degradation of major macromolecules and the 
patterns of turnover of monomers along the salinity gradient. The tidal effects on bacterial 
activity will be explored in order to assess the conservative or reactive response of the 
supporting metabolism during transport associated to tidal currents and to detect the 
location of the main activity sources in the estuary.

2. Materials and methods  
 

Study site 
The Ria de Aveiro (Figure 1) is as a bar-

built estuary (Pritchard, 1967) on the Northwest 
coast of Portugal separated from the sea by a 
sand barrier. The fresh water input to the lagoon 
during the period of time equivalent to the flood 
tide varies throughout the year around an 
average value of 1.8 Mm3, which is about 2 % 
of the total low tide volume of the lagoon 
(Silva, 1994). 

The Ria is, in fact, a mesotidal coastal 
lagoon with a complex topography representing 
a multi-estuarine ecosystem associated with 
different inflowing rivers. Canal de Navegação 
is the main navigation channel and Rio Boco is 
a small stream that continuously supplies 
freshwater to the South end of Canal de Ílhavo 
(Figure 1).  

Investigations were conducted along a 
longitudinal profile, extending across the inner-
estuary (River Boco) down to the outer segment 
of the lagoon, where 6 sampling sites spaced 
regularly at 3 Km were defined (Figure 1). The 
stations were numbered from north to south: 
stations N1 and I2 in Canal de Navegação; 
stations I4, I6 and I8 in Canal de Ílhavo and RB 
(Rio Boco) RB at the mouth of a small 
freshwater stream.  

For later comparisons, 3 segments were 
considered along this profile being a segment 
defined as the distance over which a particle is 
transported during flood tide (Silva, 1994). The 
outer-estuary (stations N1, I2), in the transition

to the coastal zone, showed salinities ranging from 33 to 35.5 PSU at high tide. The mid-
estuary (stations I4, I6, I8) showed salinities in the 20-33 PSU range at the same tide. The 
inner-estuary (station RB) was defined as the mixing zone between the fresh and marine 
waters with salinities, at high tide, below 20 PSU. 

The main sources of contamination along this profile are waste waters from the city 
of Aveiro and pollution associated to harbour activities at the outer and mid segments, 
some industries, aquaculture plants and diffuse domestic sewage drains at the mid segment 
and run-off from agriculture fields at the inner segment. 

 
 
Sampling  
The six sampling sites were visited in early summer 1997, in neap tide (NT) (12th 

July) and spring tide (ST) (20th July) conditions. Samples were always collected during 
daytime, an the centre of the channels, 0.2 m below the surface. Collection was performed 
at slack high (HT) and low (LT) tides using 5 l plastic bottles. Collected samples were kept 
cold and in the shade during transport to the laboratory where they were processed within 
the next 2-3 hours. 

 
 
Physical and chemical parameters  
Temperature and salinity were measured with a WTW LF 196 Conductivity Meter. 

Dissolved oxygen, expressed as the percentage of saturation, was determined with a WTW 
OXI 96 oxygen meter equipped with WTW BR 190 stirrer. Depth of the water column was 
determined with a Sonar probe and turbidity was evaluated with a Secchi disk. The 
determination of the concentration of suspended solids (seston) was performed after 
filtration of 500 ml aliquots through Whatman GF/C (47 mm diameter) pre-weighted, pre-
combusted filters. The filters were dried at 60 ºC for 24 hours and seston content was 
calculated as the increase in weight. Particulate organic matter (POM) was determined by 
difference in the weight of the dry seston filters after 4 hours incineration at 525 ºC of the 
dry seston (Parsons et al., 1989). POC was calculated as 50 % of the POM (Rodier, 1996). 

 
Microbiological parameters  
Total bacterial number (TBN) and bacterial organic carbon (BOC) were determined 

by cell counting under epifluorescence microscopy after fixation of the water samples with 
2 % formaldehyde (final concentration). The samples were filtered through 0.2 µm black

polycarbonate membranes (Poretics) and stained with 0.03 % acridine orange (Hobbie et 
al., 1977). On each filter 50 cells were measured with a reticule (Graticules, Ltd Model 
G2), placed in the microscope eyepiece, for the determination of the average cell volume. 
Bacterial biomass was calculated from the averaged biovolume after conversion  
(350 fgC µm-3 according to Bjørnsen, 1986).  

The heterotrophic metabolism of glucose was described by the parameters Vm 
(maximum uptake velocity) and Tr (turnover rate) following the procedure described by 
Gocke (1977). For Vm determinations, a final saturation concentration of 430 nM of  
14C-glucose was added to 10 ml aliquots. For Tr, the final concentration of 14C-glucose was 
43 nM. Substrate concentrations were chosen after kinetic analysis. Incubations were 
carried out for 2-3 hours at in situ temperature. Cells were collected on 0.2 µm Poretics 
polycarbonate membranes and radioactivity was read in a liquid scintillation counter 
(Beckman LS 6000 IC) using UniverSol as scintillation cocktail. Radioactive labelled 
glucose (SA 11.5 GBq mmol-1, 310 mCi mmol-1) was obtained from Amersham.  

Ectoenzymatic activity was determined fluorimetrically (Jasco FP-777 Fluorometer) 
as the maximum hydrolysis rate (Hm) of model substrates for ? -glucosidase (4-
methylumbelliferyl-? -D-glucoside) and Leu-aminopeptidase (L- leucine-7-amido-4-
methylcoumarin) added at the saturating concentration of 1 mM (Hoppe, 1983). 
Wavelengths for excitation and emission were respectively 380-440 nm for MCA (7-
amino-4-methylcoumarone) and 360-450 nm for MUF (4- methylumbelliferone). 
Measurements were made in 3 replicates for each sample after 1-2 hours incubations at in 
situ temperature. Calibration was performed by adding a series of 6-8 concentrations of the 
fluorescent products (0-500 nM for MUF and 0-6 µM for MCA) to a pool of water from 
the 6 sampling stations. 

Chlorophyll a was determined fluorimetrically (Yentsch and Menzel, 1963) after 
extraction with 90% acetone. In the absence of a calculated factor for chlorophyll to carbon 
conversion, the generally accepted value of 50 (Eppley et al., 1977) was used. 

 
 
Statistical methods  
As an attempt to explain the variation of the microbiological parameters, stepwise 

multiple regression was followed using chlorophyll a, seston, POM, percentage of POM in 
the total seston, temperature, salinity, total depth, secchi depth and oxygen concentration as 
independent variables. TBN was also included as independent variable for the regression 
analysis of microbial activity parameters.

3. Results 
 

Physical and chemical parameters  
Physical and chemical data are shown in Table 1. Values of salinity ranged from  

2.3 PSU at RB to 35.6 at station N1. The variation of salinity was strongest at the mouth of 
RB, with amplitude of 5.0 PSU in ST and 13.2 PSU in NT. 

The temperature of the water column (Table 1) varied between 16.6 and 26.6 ºC 
increasing towards the inner estuary. Water depth varied in the range of 0.3 to 8.6 m  
(Table 1) with tide amplitudes of 0.5 to 2.6 m. 

Dissolved oxygen concentration corresponded, in the minimum, to 76 % of the 
saturation value (Table 1). In the mid- and inner-sections of the longitudinal profile, 
particularly at LT in neap tide, oversaturation was frequent. 

Seston concentration ranged from 36 to 66 mg l-1 (Table 1) with no distinct 
longitudinal pattern of variation. At HT, however, a considerable decrease in the amount of 
seston could be observed in the inner estuary, when compared to the downstream stations. 
Nevertheless, values of Secchi depth remained quite low. In the outer and mid estuary the 
seston content at LT was up to 16 % greater than at HT. At the inner estuary the 
corresponding increase was greater (37 or 44 %) denoting a richer particle content of the 
inflowing river. 

The organic component of the seston (POC) varied between 5.5 and 7.5 mg l-1 
remaining quite stable irrespectively of salinity or tide (Table 2). POC represented a 
fraction of 11-18 % of the seston at inner estuary and of 9-14 % at mid and outer estuary. 

 

 

Phytoplankton and bacterioplankton abundance 
The highest concentrations of phytoplankton biomass (Table 2) were found at inner 

estuary (0.65-2.10 mgC l-1) or at mid estuary (0.44-1.82 mgC l-1). At outer estuary 
phytoplankton biomass ranged from 0.19 to 0.57 mgC l-1. The phytoplankton carbon 
fraction in the POC was also greater (1.9 to 9.3 times, average 4.3) in the inner- or the mid-
estuary, depending on tide.

Total bacterial number (TBN) ranged from 2.6 to 15.3 x 109 cell l-1 defining a clear 

spatial gradient of enrichment towards the inner stations of the mid-estuary, generally 
(with the exception of HT-ST) followed by a decline in the transition to RB (Figure 2). 
Bacterial organic carbon (Table 2) followed approximately the same pattern as TBN and 
varied from 45 to 418 µgC l-1 in different sections of the profile and in different tides. 
When compared to neap tide, spring tide increased by 60 % the HT biomass value at inner 
estuary.

Bacterial heterotrophic activity 
As demonstrated for bacterial numbers, the heterotrophic metabolism of glucose also 

showed major amplifications in the upper mid- or inner-sections of the lagoon (Figure 2). 
It reached a maximum value of 17.7 nmol l-1 h-1 at station I8. Glucose Tr (Figure 2) was 
lowest at the outer-estuary (0.3-4.1 % h-1) increasing inward. The maximal value  
(39.4 % h-1) was registered at RB al low tide, under spring tide conditions. The respired 
fraction was 34 % or less (average 13.8 %) of the glucose uptake.

The rates of ectoenzymatic hydrolysis were generally higher for Leu-
aminopeptidase (Leu-AMPase) than for ? -glucosidase (? -GLCase). Hm varied from 490 
to 5374 nmol l-1 h-1 for Leu-AMPase and from 4.3 to 181.3 nmol l-1 h-1 for ? -GLCase. 
Along the profile, Leu-AMPase activity was generally highest at station I8 whereas  
? -GLCase reached its maximum of activity at RB (Figure 2). At LT and in mid-estuary, 
the hydrolytic activities were up to 4.5 times (Leu-AMPase) and 2.8 times (? -GLCase) 
higher than at HT. On the contrary, at the mouth of RB there was a decrease in Leu-
AMPase activity at LT to 40 % of the HT value. This decrease was not observed in ? -
GLCase activity.

4. Discussion 
 

Bacterial abundance and heterotrophic activity along the estuarine profile 
Bacterial biomass and bacterial dependent activities were in agreement with a 

curvilinear pattern with a peak at about 25-30 PSU. This corresponds, in general, to the 
estuarine structure described by Wright and Coffin (1983), Palumbo et al. (1984), Fuks et 
al. (1991) and Bordalo et al. (1998) but the location of the peak in Canal de Ílhavo was 
shifted to a comparatively higher salinity level because of the low fresh water input. The 
Ria contrasts with other estuaries that showed maximal values for bacterial heterotrophic 
activities in the inner estuary, at low salinity values (3-10 PSU), followed by a 
conservative decrease towards higher salinities (Palumbo and Ferguson, 1978). In the 
particular situation of the Ria de Aveiro, it seems clear that the freshwater stream, at the 
inner part of the studied estuarine profile (Figure 1) is generally less polluted than the 
lagoon itself and has higher chlorophyll concentrations but lower seston content, bacterial 
abundance and rates of ectoenzymatic protein degradation. The peaks of bacterial

abundance, Leu-AMPase activity and glucose heterotrophic metabolism, accompanied by 
denser (2-4 times) phytoplankton communities and increased nitrate concentrations (data 
not shown), usually occurred at station I8 and were pushed up to RB only with the strong 
flood tide currents, under spring tide conditions. 

Values of TBN, ? -GLCase activity and glucose Tr obtained during this study 
generally fit within the range of values published for the Ria de Aveiro and for other 
temperate coastal ecosystems (Rheinheimer et al., 1989, Chróst and Veliminov, 1991, Fuks 
et al., 1991, Karner et al., 1992, Crump and Baross, 1996, Hoppe et al., 1996, Hoppe et al., 
1998). However, the metabolism of glucose along the studied profile was strongly diverted 
to incorporation in bacterial biomass (72.5-98.0 %) rather than to respiration. Higher 
growth efficiencies of estuarine bacteria, when compared to open-water communities, have 
been reported by Jørgensen et al. (1999). The authors postulate that the differences are 
related to the quality (lability) of the available organic matter. Our values are higher than 
the range of values for estuarine environments (11 to 61 %) reviewed by del Giorgio and 
Cole (1998). However, it must be taken into consideration that the single radiotracer 
approach may produce artificially high values of the incorporated fraction because the 
equilibrium of the intracellular pool is not completely achieved during the short incubation 
periods (Yahnke and Craven, 1995). 

The extracellular degradation of protein was also exceptionally high along the 
salinity gradient. Leu-AMPase Hm varied in the high range of 490 to 5374 nmol l-1 h-1, 
greatly exceeding a previous range of values (8.3 to 311 nmol l-1 h-1, after conversion) 
determined in a less rich region of the Ria de Aveiro (Hoppe et al., 1996). It exceeded also 
the range of other published results (4 to 2540 nmol l-1 h-1) for brackish water systems 
(Chróst and Velimirov, 1991, Hoppe, 1983, Hoppe et al., 1996, Hoppe et al., 1998, Rego 
et al., 1985) denoting an exceptional high potential for peptide hydrolysis in the mid 
estuary of the studied profile. This is probably related to intense anthropogenic pressure 
and increased eutrophication of the brackish water sections of the lagoon. 

 
 
Changing pattern of organic matter utilisation between the fresh water stream 

and the main body of the lagoon 
One of the most interesting aspects in the variation of bacterial abundance and 

activity along this estuarine profile is the transition between the inner station (Rio Boco) 
and the main body of the lagoon. The gradient of enrichment in bacterial abundance and 
activity, from the mouth to the inner parts of the lagoon, extends to the river only under 



Patterns of heterotrophic activity  
 

 45 

spring tide conditions, when strong flood tide currents push up a considerable amount of 
estuarine water. Under different conditions, bacterial abundance decreases at the inner 
station, as well as Leu-AMPase activity, contrasting with an increase of ? -GLCase activity. 
This seems to locate upstream the main source of bacterial potential for the degradation of 
carbohydrates and in the main body of the lagoon the major sources of bacterial carbon and 
AMPase activity. The LT/HT ratios for ? -GLCase activity at RB were above or, at least, 
close to 1 (Table 5), as occurred at the mid and outer sections. On the contrary, bacterial 
abundance and protease activity at RB were lower at LT. Relative increase of glucosidase 
in comparison to peptidase in low salinity sections was also observed by Murrell et al. 
(1999) in another estuarine system (northern San Franc isco Bay).

Bacterioplankton of RB seems to be more dependent on carbohydrates and results 
indicate that ? -GLCase activity may limit the availability of simple substrates and 
constrain glucose uptake. LT/HT ratios greater than 1 should be expected for other 
parameters related to glucose metabolism (Glucose Vm and Tr) but at RB, the LT 
stimulation of glucose metabolism was only obvious in spring tide (Table 5). The intense 
mixture with water from the mid section of the estuary during ST worked as a 
reinforcement of the supply of simple molecules and allowed the intensification of glucose 
metabolism at LT, when the negative effect of salinity was reduced.  

In terms of specific activities, ectoenzymatic activities exhibited distinct tidal 
responses. Specific values of ? -GLCase Hm (and glucose uptake Vm) showed, at RB, 
higher values at LT while, on the contrary, specific AMPase Hm at RB was higher at HT. 
However, it must be considered that cell specific activity is a statistical concept that may 
not represent the whole reality of a changing bacterial community in an unstable 
environment, since it can alternatively reflect an intrinsic difference in the composition 
(Martinez et al., 1996) or/and in the activity of marine and estuarine bacterial communities 
(Karner et al., 1992).  

Fresh water residence time at the inner section of Canal de Ílhavo ranges from 6 days 
in spring to several weeks during periods of low freshwater input (Silva, 1994). In these 
conditions, bacterial communities that reach the uppermost sections of the estuary may 
remain in the brackish water sections during considerable periods. This allows us to 
hypothesise that the shift in the patterns of heterotrophic utilisation of protein and 
carbohydrates reflects the existence of distinct microbial communities adapted to the 
different environmental conditions and nutrient sources. The observed longitudinal pattern 
would then result from the combined contributions of a riverine reservoir of potential for 
carbohydrate degradation and an estuarine reservoir of bacterial biomass and potential for 
protein utilisation. 

 
 
Reactive versus conservative bacterial heterotrophic capacities 
During the relatively slow transport from the inner sections, processes of mixing of 

communities, dilution with poorer seawater and adaptation to different organic substrates 
will considerably change the characteristics of bacterioplankton that reaches the mouth of 
the lagoon. Some parameters showed a quite conservative behaviour during tidal transport 
while others, more reactive, were distinctly shifted up and down, resulting in changes in 
the slope of the profile established along the salinity gradient. These changes can be easily

Patterns of heterotrophic activity  
 

 48 

As a general trend, bacterial abundance and activity increased inwards during flood 
tide transport (HT shift up) and decreased during ebbing (LT shift down) as a combined 
effect of dilution by poorer marine water and mixture of communities with different 
specific activity rates. For the overall of the parameters, ST results in an increase in the 
slope of the longitudinal profile but the most striking feature is the distinct behaviour of 
ectoenzymes when compared to the heterotrophic metabolism of glucose. Both 
ectoenzymes seemed to be transported/diluted up and down the estuary maintaining a quite 
good balance between shifting up at HT (I8/N1 ratios of 2.2-4.5) and shifting down at LT 
(I8/N1 ratios of 2.2-3.3). On the contrary, the negative effects of increasing salinity and 
impoverishment, associated to ebb tide transport, on glucose metabolism (Vm and Tr) were 
stronger than the stimulation of marine communities being transported to a richer 
environment. The  I8/N1 ratios for Vm and Tr of glucose were higher at LT (5.7-18.1) than 
the corresponding values calculated for HT (1.6-6.2). This reinforces the scenery of a 
limnetic source of carbohydrate-utilising bacterial communities. 

The steepest trophic gradient, evaluated by the I8/N1 ratios of phytoplankton 
biomass (4.8) and bacterial abundance (4.3), occurred at HT-NT. However, in the same 
conditions, the corresponding ratios for glucose Vm and Tr were only 1.6 and 3.2, 
respectively. This means that at HT-NT, bacterial abundance was more shifted up than the 
metabolism of glucose and explains the decrease in specific activity from the outer to the 
inner sections (Table 3). If, in this case, resuspension was related to the increase in 
bacterial abundance then, newly suspended benthic bacterial communities were 
characterised by lower specific activity rates.  

The results of multiple regression analysis (Table 4) help clarifying the distinct 
behaviour of different heterotrophic capacities during tidal transport. A close relation 
between ectoenzymatic activity and bacterial abundance can be confirmed. More than  
80 % of the variation of bacterial abundance was associated to the combined effects of 
salinity, temperature and chlorophyll a concentration. The relation with salinity is, 
however, strongly influenced by the contrast between Rio Boco and the brackish water 
stations. A similar statistical treatment excluding the RB produces a clear negative relation 
between bacterial abundance and salinity (results not shown). 

An important fraction (&gt;80 %) the variation in Leu-AMPase activity could be 
explained by the variation of TBN suggesting that this ectohydrolytic capacity is common 
and a widespread characteristic of estuarine bacterioplankton. Since it is closely associated 
to bacterial cells, processes of mixing and dilution mainly control the variation of Leu-
AMPase activity during tidal transport. In the case of ? -GLCase, the two variables TNB 



Patterns of heterotrophic activity  
 

 49 

and salinity explained 82 % of the variation, denoting an increase in salinity effects in 
relation to Leu-AMPase. 

The variation of temperature alone could not explain more than 30-40% of the 
variation in glucose Vm and Tr suggesting the greater importance of other variables, like 
the size and quality of the dissolved organic matter pool, and justifies the reactivity of 
these parameters during tidal transport. It has been reported that, in aquatic ecosystems, the 
concentration of dissolved polymers in DOC is usually at least one order of magnitude 
higher than the particulate fraction (Zdanowski and Figueiras 1997). Results from Murrel 
at al. (1999) indicate that during the warm season, when flux of fresh water and the supply 
of particles to the estuaries are reduced, seston suffers from low nutritional quality. We 
believe that in the ma in body of the Ria de Aveiro, like in other estuarine environments, 
(Azam and Hodson, 1977, Williams, 1981, Ducklow, 1983, Murrell et al., 1999) bacteria 
obtain their organic carbon mainly from the flux of DOC rather than from the 
decomposition of essentially detrital POM. The shift from the utilisation of complex 
substrates, eventually associated to high-quality seston at RB, to the increasing importance 
of simple dissolved substrates as nutrient sources, at the brackish water sections of the 
estuary, may contribute to the high reactivity of parameters related to the incorporation of 
monomers. 

 
 

5. Conclusions  
 
The profiles of variation of abundance and activity along an estuarine profile in the 

Ria de Aveiro, revealed a shifting from a more N-associated metabolism at the main body 
of the lagoon to an increase of the importance of the C-utilising community at the mouth of 
the fresh water stream Rio Boco. Ectoenzymatic activity followed more closely the 
variation of bacterial abundance than monomer uptake and seemed to be mainly 
determined by the variation of salinity, temperature and phytoplankton biomass. However, 
the activity of ? -GLCase was strongly associated to the interface with the limnetic 
environment being negatively affected by increasing salinity.  

Along the profile, and under different tidal conditions, ectoenzymatic activity 
appeared to be transported up (stimulated) or down (depressed) the estuary, following a 
quite conservative pattern and responding probably mainly to dilutions effects associated 
to the entrance of poorer marine water during flood tide. The heterotrophic metabolism of 
glucose showed a more reactive behaviour. This parameter responded negatively to the 



Patterns of heterotrophic activity  
 

 50 

ebb-tide transport. On the contrary, during transport to inner stations of the lagoon there 
was a comparably less pronounced and, in some degree, more reversible stimulation. We 
did not attempt to characterise the dissolved organic matter that reaches the brackish water 
section of the lagoon mainly from allochtonous origins. However, ectoenzymatic activity 
could be limiting the turnover of monomers, at least at the inner section of the studied 
profile. The shifting to a more carbohydrate- utilising bacterial community at the limnetic 
end of the estuary points to an increased importance of autotrophic processes as a source of 
substrates during the warm season and in the day light period.

CHAPTER IV 

SHORT-TIME RESPONSES OF THE NATURAL PLANKTONIC BACTERIAL 
COMMUNITY TO THE CHANGING WATER PROPERTIES IN AN ESTUARINE 

ENVIRONMENT: ECTOENZYMATIC ACTIVITY, GLUCOSE 
INCORPORATION AND BIOMASS PRODUCTION 

Cunha, M. A., Almeida, M. A. and Alcântara, F. (2001) Microbial Ecology, 42(1):69-79 
 

_________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
Abstract - The possibility that two principal bacterial communities expressing different levels of 
heterotrophic activity might co-exist in an estuarine ecosystem (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal), and could quickly 
respond to tidal fluctuations of environmental factors, was experimentally tested in diffusion chambers by 
swapping the dissolved components of the natural water between the two communitie s and comparing their 
reactivity against the unaltered controls. 
The results for ectoenzymatic activity (Leu-aminopeptidase and ? -glucosidase), glucose incorporation and 
biomass production after transference of the marine bacterial community to brackish wa ter showed maxima 
in the range of 241-384 % of the control values. The opposite transference of the brackish-water bacterial 
community to marine water produced maximal decreases to 0.14-0.58 % of the control values.  
In a reverse experiment, designed as the return to the initial conditions after 2 hours of the first exposure, the 
marine community rapidly re -acquired the characteristic low levels of activity. Contrastingly, the negative 
effects of 2 hours of exposure to marine water on the activity of the brackish water bacteria persisted, at least 
for 4 hours, after return to their natural water. 
The apparent short -term irreversibility of the decline in activity of the brackish water bacteria when exposed 
to marine water, in parallel with the quick and reversible positive response of the marine water bacteria to the 
brackish water, suggests the development of two distinct bacterioplankton communities adapted to the 
environmental conditions prevailing at distinct sections of the estuary. The reactivity to environmental 
changes demonstrated by the two communities allows the prediction of estuarine profiles of bacterial activity 
steeper than those expected from the conservative transport of bacterial cells associated with tidal currents. 

 
 
1. Introduction 

 
Estuarine bacterioplankton communities develop and evolve under unstable 

environmental conditions. Along estuarine gradients, marine and fluvial influences may 
combine to produce different patterns of bacterial abundance and heterotrophic activity. 
Denser and more active bacterioplankton communities may occur at intermediate salinities 
?5, 12, 26, 38? frequently associated with the maximum turbidity zone. However, under the 
particular environmental and morphological characteristics of an estuarine system, peaks 
of abundance and activity may be found at low salinity values (3-10 PSU), followed by 
conservative decrease towards higher salinity sections ?25?; contrastingly, maximum 



Short-time responses to changing water properties  
 

 54 

activity may occur at the outer estuary ?6?. Generally, at low salinity levels 
bacterioplankton communities exhibit higher growth efficiencies ?14, 20? and express 
relatively higher rates of ? -glucosidase activity ?24?. On the contrary, closer to the 
interface with the sea, bacterioplankton seems to be more adapted to the degradation of 
protein ?24?. 

Considerable work has been developed in attempts to determine the environmental 
factors controlling the activity profiles of estuarine bacterioplankton. The availability of 
inorganic nutrients ?37? and the quantity and quality (lability) of the pool of organic matter 
may exert control over the production of bacterial biomass ?14, 21?, growth yield ?3, 20?, 
ectoenzymatic activity ?24? and monomer uptake ?8?. Processes involving longitudinal 
transport of particles along the estuary and exchange of materials between the sediments 
and the water column may ultimately modify the quality of the substrates available for 
bacterial utilisation. In ecosystems where rivers are responsible for the major inputs of 
particles, there is a decrease in the quality of particulate organic carbon (POC) from the 
inner sections to the mouth of the estuary and a corresponding decrease in bacterial 
heterotrophic activity ?24?. Closer to the riverine source of rich particulate substrates, 
bacterial activity was frequently found to be uncoupled from primary production since the 
in situ supply of organic substrates was not acting as a limiting factor ?32?. It has also been 
demonstrated that fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the sediments may 
stimulate bacterial biomass production ?23? and increase growth rates ?16?. The impact of 
the release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the sediments on bacterial activity in 
the water column can be more important in shallow areas, particularly those with fine 
sediments and high rates of benthic primary production ?23?. 

The dynamics of bacterial carbon metabolism respond to the shifting properties of 
the water column between different sections of an estuary ?31?. One question about the 
establishment of patterned estuarine gradients of bacterial activity is whether these 
gradients reflect reversible responses of versatile communities and/or processes of mixing 
of communities adapted to different prevailing environmental conditions and nutrient 
sources along this gradient. Another question is: do these responses occur over a time scale 
that can allow observable effects during ebb and flood tides? 

To answer these questions and to predict the effects of changing estuarine 
hydrodynamics, an experimental set-up was devised to challenge bacterioplankton 
populations, from the outer and mid estuary, to respond to contrasting estuarine water. This 
work reports on the short-term changes in heterotrophic bacterial activity.

2. Methods  
 
Study site 
The Ria de Aveiro (Fig. 1) is a branched 

estuarine ecosystem in the Northwest coast of 
Portugal with maximum length and width of 45 
and 10 Km, respectively. The tidal water 
exchange with the ocean is about 89 Mm3 while 
the average fresh water input during an 
equivalent period of time is, on average,  
1.8 Mm3 ?33?. The ecosystem is frequently 
described as a coastal lagoon within which is 
distinguished a deeper marine zone (10 to  
&gt;20 m deep at high tide) encompassing  
22-35 % of the total water volume of the Ria 
?33? and a progressively shallower brackish 
water zone, branched in several channels along 
which salinity gradients develop. For this study, 
2 sampling stations were chosen in order to 
represent contrasting water characteristics 
within the estuary: station N1 in Canal de 
Navegação, close to the mouth of the lagoon, 
representing the deep marine zone, and station 
I6 in Canal de Ílhavo, representing the shallow 
inner brackish water zone. 

 
 
Sampling  
The sampling sites and the moment of 

collection in relation to the tidal cycle were 
chosen in order to represent sharp contrasting 
environmental conditions within the estuary. 
Station N1 was sampled 2 hours before high tide 
(HT). As the volume of water that enters this 
section during flood tide (89 Mm3) is much

sampling stations indicated by arrows: station

mouth, and station I6 in Canal de Ílhavo, 9

larger than the 31 mM3 that remain at lo w tide [33], we assumed that the samples obtained 
when ocean water was in full flow into the estuary would fairly represent marine 
environmental conditions and the corresponding bacterioplankton communities. At station 
I6 sampling was performed late in the ebb flux, 2 hours before low tide (LT). It was 
assumed that in these samples, the characteristics of the water and of the bacterioplankton 
communities of the mid section of the estuary would be fairly represented. 

Stations N1 and I6 were visited in February, March and June 1998. A total volume 
of 60 l of water was collected from 0.2 m below the surface, by consecutive immersions of 
a 10 l plastic bottle. Samples were transported to the laboratory in 100 l dark plastic 
containers.  

 
 
Water quality variables 
The physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics of the marine and 

brackish water samples were determined within 6 hours after collection. 
Salinity was measured with a conductivity meter (WTW – Wissenschaftlich 

Technische Werkstätten, Model LF 196). The determination of the concentration of 
suspended solids (seston) was performed after filtration of 500 ml aliquots through 
Whatman GF/C (47 mm diameter) pre-weighted, pre-combusted filters. The filters were 
dried at 60 ºC for 24 hours and the seston content was calculated as the increase in weight. 
The loss of weight by ignition, as a measure of the particulate organic matter content 
(POM), was achieved by 4 hours of incineration of dry seston at 525 ºC ?27?. POC was 
calculated as 50 % of the POM ?30?. Chlorophyll a concentrations were determined 
fluorimetrically ?39? after extraction with 90 % acetone. 

In the February samples the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 
inorganic nutrients were also determined. Samples for DOC analyses were filtered through 
pre-combusted Whatman GF/C filters and kept frozen (-20ºC). An independent laboratory 
(Ambio, Ltd) carried out DOC determinations by combustion and infrared detection ?2? in 
a Dohrman DC-180 Analyser. For nutrient analyses, 25 ml aliquots were filtered through 
cellulose acetate membranes with a pore size of 0.45 µm (MSI - Micron Separation Inc.) 
and stored at –20 ºC until analysis. The concentration of NO3

- + NO2
- was determined by 

the sulfanilic acid method after the reduction of NO3
- to NO2

- in a cadmium column. The 
analysis of PO4

3- followed the molybdate method. For these determinations, the standard 
procedures for nutrient analyses ?35? were adapted to the Segmented Flow Injection 
Automatic Analyser, Alliance Instruments, France – Evolution II ?1?.

Bacterioplankton parameters  
Total bacterial number (TBN) was determined by direct counting under 

epifluorescence microscopy after fixation of the water samples with 2 % formaldehyde 
(final concentration), followed by collection of cells on 0.2 µm black polycarbonate 
membranes (Poretics) and staining with 0.03% acridine orange ?15?. 

Ectoenzymatic activity was determined fluorimetrically (Jasco FP-777 
Fluorometer) as the maximum hydrolysis rate (Hm) of two model substrates,  
4-methylumbelliferyl-? -D-glucoside for for ? -glucosidase (? -GLCase) and L- leucine-7-
amido-4-methyl-coumarin for Leu-aminopeptidase, (Leu-AMPase) ?17?, at a saturating 
concentration of 1 mM. For each sample, 3 replicates were analysed. Wavelengths for 
excitation and emission were respectively 380-440 nm for MCA (7-amino-4-
methylcoumarone) and 360-450 nm for MUF (4- methylumbelliferone). The incubation 
period varied between 1 and 2 hours and took place at a standard temperature of 20º C. 
Fluorescent substrates and standards were purchased from Sigma Co. 

Glucose incorporation (Glucose Vm) ?13? was determined in 3 replicates and one 
blank fixed with 2 % formaline at a final saturation concentration of 430 nM of  
14C-glucose (Amersham, SA 11.5 GBq mmol-1, 310 mCi mmol-1). Incubations were carried 
out for 2 hours at 20ºC. Cells were collected on 0.2 µm Poretics polycarbonate membranes 
and radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter Beckman LS 6000 IC using 
UniverSol (ICN Biomedicals, USA) as the scintillation cocktail. 

Bacterial biomass productivity (BBP) was determined according to Simon and 
Azam ?34? in 10 ml aliquots (3 replicates and one blank fixed with 2 % formaline) by the 
incorporation of 3H- leucine (Amersham, SA 61 Ci mmol-1) at a final concentration of  
30 nM. Incubation took place at 20 ºC for 1 hour. Cells were harvested on 0.2 µm Poretics 
polycarbonate membranes and washed with 10 ml cold 10 % TCA. Radioactivity was read 
in a liquid scintillation counter Beckman LS 6000 IC using UniverSol as the scintillation 
cocktail.  
 
 

Time course of bacterioplankton response during exposure to contrasting 
water quality 

Two experimental incubation systems were prepared (Fig. 2). Each one consisted of 
a stirred water bath with a capacity of 20 l completely filled either with water from station 
N1 (N1 tank representing the marine zone of the estuary) or from station I6 (I6 tank 
representing the brackish water of the mid estuary). Temperature was kept at 20 ºC. Each

diffusion chamber, with a capacity of 170 ml, consisted of a hollow nylon cylinder with an 
external height of 4.5 cm closed at the tops with two 12.5 cm diameter polycarbonate 
membranes (Poretics, 0.2 µm). The membranes were held in place by Viton® 
fluoroelastomer o-rings attached to nylon frames, tightly screwed to the cylinder. A neck 
and an opening at the middle of the chamber allowed the initial filling and periodic 
sampling. The sampling port was kept closed during immersion by a silicone-rubber 
stopper covered by a screw cap ?28?.

Fig. 2: Schematic representation of the experimental set up: stirred water baths were filled with water from 
station N1 (marine conditions) or station I6 (brackish water conditions) and diffusion chambers (tests and 
controls), prepared as described in the text, were immersed hanging from buoys. 

 
One “blank” chamber, filled with the same water as that in each water bath, was 

used to assess the dilution effect on bacterial abundance and total bacterial activity 
(entrance of water due to the reduction of pressure inside the chambers associated to the 
decrease in volume after repeated sampling). Further testing allowed us to assume that the 
water was entering the chamber only through the surface of the membrane and not through 
the top opening or through the junctions of the membrane to the body of the chamber 
(transport of bacterial cells was not observed). 

Two sets of 7 diffusion chambers were completely filled with water either from N1 
or from I6. The marine N1 tank received four N1 chambers (1 blank + 3 controls) and three 
I6 chambers (3 tests). In the brackish water incubation system the set-up involved four

 59 

chambers with I6 water (1 blank + 3 controls) and three chambers with N1 water (3 tests). 
All the chambers were kept completely immersed, and in an upright position (with the cap 
just surfacing) with the help of individual buoys. Time recording was initiated at the 
moment of immersion. Test samples were exposed to contrasting water characteristics for a 
maximum of 6 hours, corresponding approximately to the duration of one half of a tidal 
cycle. After 2 and 4 hours, chambers were emerged and a volume of 30 ml of water was 
collected from each chamber with the help of a silicone tube connected to a plastic syringe. 
The three N1 test or control sub-samples and the three I6 test or control sub-samples were 
pooled to obtain the volume of sample necessary for the determinations of all variables. 
The blank chamber in each incubation system was also emerged after 2 and 4 hour and the 
total volume of water inside the chamber was measured. From this volume, an aliquot of 
30 ml was withdrawn in order to approach the conditions in the test and control chambers. 
The remaining volume of water was again inserted in the blank chamber that was then 
immersed back into the respective tank. At the end of the exposure period, the volumes of 
water remaining inside the blank, control and test chambers were measured. 

The assessment of the variation of bacterial abundance and activity during the 
period of exposure, was performed through the determination of ectoenzymatic activities 
(leucine-aminopeptidase and ? -glucosidase), Vm of glucose incorporation, and bacterial 
biomass production after 2, 4 and 6 hours of incubation. TBN was also determined at the 
same time intervals with exception of the February experiment, when TBN was determined 
only at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. The methodologies involved were 
described above. 

 
 
Reversion of exposure  
In one of the experiments (June 1998), an attempt was made to observe the effects 

of reverting the marine and brackish water bacteria to the approximate conditions of their 
natural environment after 2 hours of exposure to contrasting water. For this purpose, one 
extra set of 3 test chambers was included in each tank during the first 2 hours and then 
transferred to the tank containing water of the same origin, where incubation continued for 
a further 4 hours period. The chambers to test reversion effects were also sampled after 2, 4 
and 6 hours of exposure.

3. Results 
 
Initial characterisation of marine and brackish water samples 
The values corresponding to the initial properties of the marine (station N1) and 

brackish water (station I6) sections of the lagoon are summarised in Table 1. 
Brackish water showed low or medium salinity and higher concentration of POC 

and chlorophyll a. The largest differences in salinity, seston and POC between the two 
samples were observed in February. On that occasion nutrients and DOC were also 
analysed. The results confirmed the higher availability of organic and inorganic nutrients 
in the brackish water samples, particularly nitrite plus nitrate (increase by a factor of 17).

Bacterioplankton characteristics 
Bacterial communities in I6 water, at low tide, were 1.3-1.7 denser and up to 10.8 

times more active than the communities from the outer marine zone, at high tide (Table 1). 
TBN ranged from 4.2 to 8.2 x 109 cell l-1 in samples from I6 and from 3.1 to  
4.7 x 109 cell l-1 in samples from N1. Leu-AMPase Hm was 2713-3570 nmol l-1 h-1 in I6, 
2.0-5.2 times higher than the corresponding values in N1 water. On a per cell basis, the 
Leu-AMPase activity in the brackish water zone varied in the range of 435- 
843 attomol cell-1 h-1, 1.2-4.1 times higher than in cells from the marine zone.  

? -GLCase Hm at I6 varied from 79.4 to 155.0 nmol l-1h-1, an activity that was 2.2-
4.2 times higher than at N1 (Table 1). This 
represented a cell specific activity 1.3-3.1 times 
greater than at N1. 

Initial values of glucose Vm ranged from 
1.0-4.9 nmol l-1 h-1 in N1 samples and from 4.0-
9.3 nmol l-1 h-1 in I6 samples, representing 1.9-
5.9 times greater total activity and 1.1-4.0 times 
greater specific activity (Table 1). 

BBP ranged from 1.84 to 5.30 µgC l-1h-1 
at station I6 and from 0.49 to 1.32 µgC l-1h-1 at 
station N1. Specific BBP in I6 bacterioplankton 
ranged from 0.87 to 1.26 fgC cell-1 h-1, 1.4-8.4 
times higher than for N1 bacteria. The largest 
difference observed in the variables, which 
described the two initial bacterioplankton 
communities, was exhibited by BBP for which 
the I6 values were 2.1 to 10.8 times greater 
(Table 1).

was achieved. The variation in the concentration of NO2
-+NO3

- and PO4
3- (Fig. 4) indicates 

that concentrations of dissolved substances followed a pattern similar to that of salinity. 
Thus, there was effective percolation of water and solutes through the membranes. 

Microbiological variables responded quickly to exposure to the contrasting water 
(Fig. 5). Usually, after only 2 hours, there was a decrease in the activity of the brackish 
water bacterioplankton incubated in outer-estuary water, and an increase in the activity of 
the outer-estuary bacterial community incubated in brackish water, relative to the control 
values.  

The amplitude of positive or negative effects was different between experiments 
and between different variables. In general, however, the absolute magnitudes of the 
positive and ne gative effects were similar. Ectoenzymatic activities seemed to be less 
affected by the shifting of environmental properties. Response coefficients, calculated as 
the ratios between the values determined in the test and in the corresponding control 
populations (Fig. 6), indicated lower intensity of the responses of Leu-AMPase Hm (0.49-
2.41) and ? -GLCase Hm (0.58-2.53) than those of glucose Vm and BBP (response 

coefficients of 0.14-3.84 and 0.21-2.90, 
respectively). In the February experiment, 
ectoenzymatic activities showed particularly 
week responses. The values of the response 
coefficient were 0.8-1.2 for Leu-AMPase Hm 
and 0.7-1.3 for ? -GLCase Hm. In the same 
experiment glucose Vm and BBP responded 
more intensely generating response coefficients 
of 0.7-2.3 and 0.3-2.9, respectively.  

The variation of bacterial abundance 
(TBN) in response to changes in environmental 
conditions was low and the differences between 
tests and controls were not statistically 
significant. As a consequence, and as a general 
pattern, the responses in specific activity rates 
of the marine communities exposed to estuarine 
water, and of the estuarine communities 
exposed to marine water (Fig. 7) were, 
obviously, opposite.

Reversion exposure effects  
In June, a parallel test on the reversibility of the effects of exposure was carried out. 

Samples from the marine station (N1) exposed to water collected at the inner station (I6) 
responded by increasing the total and specific activity rates, generating, in this way, 
response coefficients greater than one. However, when after 2 hours the test samples were 
transferred back to the marine incubation conditions, there was a strong reversion of the

Both the primary response and the reversion effect occurred within a short period, usually 
less than 2 hours. Leu-AMPase was particularly sensitive. Reversion produced a reduction 
in Leu-AMPase activity to values that were lower than in the control N1 chambers. 

Samples from the estuarine station I6 exposed to marine water incubation were 
negatively affected. However, when returned to the estuarine water tank, only ? -GLCase

fact that underlies the responses observed in these experiments. The concentrations of 
seston and POC were 1.2-2.0 times higher in I6 than in N1, reflecting different inputs of 
particles from the fresh water stream Rio Boco, at the southeastern end of Canal de Ílhavo, 
local discharges along the channel and eventual resuspension of bottom sediments. 
Regardless of some patchiness, sediments from stations N1 and I6 correspond dominantly 
to medium sand. They differ, however, in the organic content which was estimated as 
 2.9 % of the dry weight at I6 and 0.8 % at N1 [9]. Higher chlorophyll concentrations give 
the indication of greater eutrophication in the mid sections of the estuary, also associated 
with exceptionally high concentrations of NO2

- + NO3
- (17 times higher than at station N1). 

Primary production at the brackish water section was estimated as  
3.31 µgC l-1 h-1 at LT while the HT value closer to the mouth was 0.13 µgC l-1 h-1 

(Almeida, unpublished data). I6 water seemed to have a slightly better quality of 
particulate substrates. Assuming the conversion factor of 50 [11], phytoplankton-C 
represented 1.7-4.4 % of the total POC at station N1 and 2.2-5.3 % at station I6. The 
results of the February experiment also showed higher concentrations of dissolved organic 
substrates in I6 water. 

The bacterioplankton communities, which were contrasted in our study, differed 
less in density than in activity, at the beginning of the experiments. The bacterial 
communities found at mid-estuary during LT were denser and more active than those from 
station N1. The ratios derived from the initial values of the two communities (I6/N1) were 
1.3-1.7 for TBN, 2.0-5.2 for Leu-AMPase, 2.2-4.2 for ? -GLCase, 2.2-4.2 for glucose Vm 
and 2.0-10.8 for BBP.  Higher rates of total plankton respiration at the brackish water 
section of the Ria de Aveiro had already been reported [9]. When specific activities were 
calculated they revealed that the average brackish water bacterial cell was 1.1 to 8.4 times 
more active than its marine counterpart. Changes in specific activity have been reported as 
reflecting an intrinsic difference in the composition [22] and/or in the activity of marine 
and estuarine bacterial communities [21], which could, in this case, be an indication of the 
presence of communities adapted to different nutritional environments along the estuarine 
gradient. It has been shown that the experimental addition of protein to estuarine 
bacterioplankton communities produced, within 1-4 days, considerable changes in the 
composition of the community, in terms of the relative importance of particular 
phylogenetic groups, as well as the increase in growth rate [29]. The long residence time of 
fresh water estimated for the eutrophic mid section of Canal de Ílhavo (10.1-97.4 days) 
[33] would be compatible with strong changes in the composition of bacterial communities 
which could also be expressed by different responses to variation in salinity and nutrient

supply.  
The values of abundance and activity determined for the two bacterial communities 

fit within the ranges published for other highly productive coastal systems [4, 12, 17, 18, 
19]. High potential for protein degradation (Leu-AMPase) has been found in previous 
work in the Ria de Aveiro [10]. 

The primary question regarding the existence of distinct bacterial communities in 
different sections of the estuary was addressed by characterising the effects of the 
reciprocal swapping between contrasting conditions in terms of response time, intensity 
and reversibility. 

Both communities responded rapidly, within the initial 2-4 hours of exposure. 
Samples from the same sites amended with simple (glucose, mixture of 10 amino acids, 
complex B vitamins) and complex (yeast extract, commercial algae exudates) organic 
substrates in microcosm experiments showed significant variations of activity within 6 
hours of incubation, but the fraction of CTC-active cells remained quite constant 
(manuscript in preparation). This may indicate that the observed short-term responses are 
more due to the variation of activity rates of individual active cells than to variation of 
proportion of active cells in the total community.  

Responses expressed by hydrolytic and uptake enzymatic systems were probably 
not related to the production of the relevant enzymes. Shifting between different enzymatic 
systems with distinct kinetic characteristics [36], and the direct effects of salinity on the 
structure and integrity of enzymatic systems, could explain the ready variation of the levels 
of activity. In fact, preliminary results showed that the increase of salinity of I6 water from 
10 to 30 PSU by addition of NaCl produced an immediate reduction of Leu-AMPase and 
? -GLCase activities to values corresponding respectively to 53 and 42 % of the initial Hm 
values (data not shown).  

Changes in water properties had a greater effect on the direct uptake of small 
molecules (Glucose Vm and BBP according to the method) than on ectoenzymatic 
activities. This may be related to the variability of the organic sources. Monomer uptake 
responds to variations in the DOM pool [29, 31, 32], which in this study was larger in the 
brackish water zone. Ectoenzymatic activity, on the contrary, may be regulated by the 
availability of the more complex substrates which could be partially adsorbed to particles 
and, in this form, would not exert any effect on the confined test communities since they 
would not percolate into the chambers through the 0.2 µm pores of the membranes. In 
addition, the increase in the availability of monomers after transference of marine samples 
to brackish water could even reduce the activity of ectoenzymatic systems [7] and, in this

way, counterbalance, to some extent, the stimulatory effect of the increase in the 
availability of dissolved polymers.  

In the March and June experiments, when the salinity values at the brackish water 
section were quite high (&gt; 18 PSU), responses were stronger and bacterial activity in the 
test samples reached levels identical to those of the natural community of the contrasting 
water type. This could imply that the communities were not significantly distinct and that 
the expression of activity would be highly susceptible to environmental control. However, 
in February, when the salinity difference between the initial N1 and I6 samples was 
maximal, the reaction of the marine community to brackish water conditions was weak 
(BBP and glucose Vm) or undetectable (Leu-AMPase and ? -GLCase). This could be 
expected from a marine community resenting the lower salinity of the brackish water and 
so being less capable of taking advantage of higher concentration of organic substrates. 
Some parallel experiments revealed that, during summer, the stimulation of the marine 
community exposed to water from the inner section of the estuary was enhanced if NaCl 
was added up to a salinity of 34 PSU (Almeida, unpublished data). These results could 
indicate the existence of communities with distinct salinity optima.  

The different reversibility of the responses was interpreted as a further indication of 
the distinct nature of the two communities. The stimulation of the marine community 
rapidly ceased after transference to marine water. On the contrary, brackish communities 
did not recover from the loss of activity and their inhibition generally persisted even after 4 
hours of incubation in their natural water. The unrecoverable loss of activity was not 
accompanied by significant variation in bacterial abundance. This supports the assertion 
that viability, rather than the recognisable size of the community, was negatively affected 
by salinity, eventually in an irreversible way.  

The short-term reactivity of bacterioplankton to changes in salinity and in the 
degree of eutrophication in a shallow estuary such as the Ria de Aveiro, is compatible with 
the hypothesis of activation and deactivation of bacterial cells during tidal transport and 
has major implications in the understanding of estuarine profiles of bacterioplankton 
activity. The stimulation of marine bacterial cells during flood transport, and the opposite 
effect on brackish-water bacteria during the ebb, will magnify the difference in 
heterotrophic activity between the outer and mid sections of the estuary and produce 
steeper gradients than those expected from the conservative mixture of distinct 
communities.

Abstract - In order to assess the relative importance of tidal resuspension of sediments and transport of 
particles from salt marshes as factors of variability in bacterioplankton abundance and activity, a transect was 
defined at one of the most productive sections of a shallow estuarine system (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal). 
Bacterial abundance, ectoenzymatic activity and heterotrophic metabolism of glucose were assayed in 
samples collected at four sites in the transect during four springtime tidal cycles. 
The patterns of variation of particulate materials (seston, POC and chlorophyll a) along the transect did not 
show significant relation with proximity to the margin or to the bottom sediment. Nevertheless, proximity to 
the salt marsh or to the bottom sediment surface favoured glucose incorporation and aminopeptidase activity. 
A multiple stepwise regression analysis using temperature, salinity, seston, POC and chlorophyll a  
concentration as independent variables could explain a relatively small proportion (12 – 43 %) of the 
observed variability in different bacterioplankton parameters, with the exception of the fraction of particle -
attached bacteria (66.5 % of the variability was explained). 
Resuspension and runoff, in the strict sense of transference of particulate materials, could not be clearly 
distinguished in the spatial patterns of variation of the particulate variables. This, together with the poor 
contribution of these parameters to the transversal and tidal variability of bacterial activity, dismisses the 
importance of inputs of suspended material across the sediment/water interface and from neighbour salt 
marshes in the control of bacterial activity, that, instead, may be exerted through DOM fluxes.  

 

 

Key words : Estuarine bacterioplankton; ectoenzymatic activity; heterotrophic activity; 
sediment resuspension. 
 

 

1. Introduction 
 

Different processes of transference of materials between benthic and planktonic 
compartments, as well as between salt marshes and the main estuarine body, may intervene 
significantly in the supply of substrates to the plankton. This contribution may be decisive 
in the dynamics of estuarine bacterioplankton. Maxima of bacterial abundance and 
heterotrophic activity along estuarine gradients are often found in high turbidity zones 
(Erckenbracher and Stevenson, 1975; Wright and Coffin 1983; Fuks et al., 1991)

indicating a tight coupling between particle inputs and stimulation of bacterial 
heterotrophic activity. Bacterial communities are able to respond quickly to these inputs 
because of their rapid growth rates and high physiological diversity (Wainright, 1987). 
Therefore, resuspension events and runoff from the margins are sometimes vented as 
possible explanations for high productivity at mid and inner estuarine sections (Hoppe et 
al., 1996).  

Several studies have shown that mechanical resuspension of sediment particles either 
by tidal currents, wind forcing, wind- induced waves, dredging or bottom trawling, caused 
significant increase in seston content, particulate organic carbon, particulate organic 
nitrogen, chlorophyll a and bacterial biomass (Demers et al., 1987; Riemann and 
Hoffmann, 1991; Ritzrau and Graf, 1992). Different types of experimental approaches 
have confirmed these field observations. Bacterial biomass production significantly 
increased in water samples that were in physical contact with the sediment surface and the 
stimulation was more intense when sediments were heavily colonised by 
microphytobenthos (Middelboe et al., 1998). Bacterial abundance and total cell volume 
responded positively to amendment of natural seawater with resuspended particulate 
material (Wainright, 1987). Induced sediment resuspension in mesocosm experiments also 
increased chlorophyll a concentrations in the water and caused significant stimulation of 
bacterioplankton biomass production (Sloth et al., 1996).  

Densely colonised salt marshes frequently found in the banks of estuarine channels 
may also export considerable amounts of materials to the main body of the estuary (Dame 
et al., 1986) through processes of advective transport of solutes and particles. However, the 
dissolved compounds may dominate the net flux of organic carbon from the marshes to the 
estuary (Taylor and Allanson, 1995). 

Previous studies on the dynamics of bacterioplankton in the Ria de Aveiro allowed 
the identification of the shallow sections of different channels as sites of intense bacterial 
heterotrophic activity (Hoppe et al., 1996; Cunha et al., 1999; Cunha et al., 2000). Here, 
we report on a field approach to test the hypothesis that particles transported from the salt 
marshes and/or resuspended from the sediment may stimulate the heterotrophic activity of 
bacterioplankton communities and are ultimately related to the establishment of high rates 
of ectoenzymatic activity and glucose heterotrophic metabolism at an intermediate section 
of one of the main channels (Canal de Ílhavo) of the lagoon.

2. Materials and methods  
 

Study site 
Ria de Aveiro (Figure 1) is a branched estuarine ecosystem, also described as a 

coastal lagoon, in the Northwest coast of Portugal, 
with the maximum length and width of 45 and  
10 Km, respectively. The tidal range at the mouth 
varies from 0.6 m in neap tides to 3.2 m in spring 
tides (Dias et al., 2000 ). The average depth of the 
lagoon is 1  m and the shallow brackish water 
sections (&amp;lt;3 m deep) account for approximately  
95 % of the total wet area at high tide (83 Km2) and 
together, encompass 75 % of the total volume of 
water of 161 Mm3 (Silva, 1994; Dias et al., 2000). 
The deeper marine zone varies in depth from 10 to 
&gt; 20 m at high tide. 

This study took place at the transect I6 located 
at the shallow brackish water section of Canal de 
Ílhavo, with its origin at the main navigation 
channel and extending to Southeast. Along the 
transect, 4 sampling sites were defined: S1 and S2 
respectively at approximately 0.5 and 1.5 m from 
the west margin; S3 and S4 referred to the centre of 
the channel (taken as the deeper point) were located 
respectively at 5 m from the centre (measured 
westwards) and at the centre itself.  

 
 
Sampling  
Transect I6 was visited 4 times from April to 

May 1997, under spring (6th and 22nd May) and 
neap (29th April and 30th May) tide conditions. 
Water samples were collected 0.2 m below water 
surface at all stations and also at 0.5 m above the 
sediment surface at the deeper sites (S3 and S4). In

Aveiro lagoon (Portugal) with

each sampling day, samples were collected at 6 moments of the tidal cycle: low tide (LT), 
2 hours after low tide (LT+2), 2 hours before high tide (HT-2), high tide (HT), 2 hours 
after high tide (HT+2) and 2 hours before low tide (LT-2). All samples were kept cold and 
in the shade during transport to the laboratory where they were processed within 2-3 hours 
from collection. 

 
 
Physical and chemical characteristics 
Temperature and salinity were measured with a WTW LF 196 Conductivity Meter. 

Depth of the water column was determined with a Sonar probe (Hondex PS-7 LCD Digital 
Sounder). Approximate distance to the west margin was visually estimated. 

The concentrations of total (seston) and organic (POM) suspended solids were 
determined according to Parsons et al. (1989). Particulate organic carbon (POC) was 
assumed to be 50% of the POM (Rodier, 1996). Chlorophyll a was quantified 
fluorimetrically (Yentsch and Menzel, 1963) in a Jasco FP-777 espectrofluorimeter after 
extraction with 90% acetone. 

 
 
Bacterioplankton characteristics 
The densities of the total bacterial community (TBN) and of the particle-attached 

fraction (AB) were determined by direct counting under epifluorescence microscopy (Leitz 
Laborlux) after staining with 0.03% acridine orange of cells collected on Poretics 0.2 µm 
black polycarbonate membranes (Hobbie et al., 1977).  

Ectoenzymatic activity was determined fluorimetrically (Jasco FP-777 Fluorometer) 
as the maximum hydrolysis rate (Hm) of two model substrates (Hoppe, 1983),  
4-methylumbelliferyl-? -D-glucoside for ? -glucosidase (BTGLase) and L-leucine-7-amido-
4-methyl-coumarin for Leu-aminopeptidase (AMPase), added up to a saturating 
concentration of 1 mM. Samples were incubated 1-2 hours at in situ temperature. For the 
discrimination of the contribution of attached bacteria to total ectoenzymatic activity, water 
samples were fractionated by gentle vacuum filtration (&amp;lt;50 mmHg) through 1.2 µm pore 
cellulose nitrate membranes (Sartorius). Determinations of ectoenzymatic activities were 
performed in the whole water samples and in the &amp;lt;1.2 µm fractions. 

The heterotrophic metabolism of glucose was described by the parameters Vm 
(ma ximum uptake velocity) and Tr (turnover rate) following the procedure described by 
Gocke (1977). Vm was determined after the addition of a final saturation concentration of

430 nM of 14C-glucose (Amersham, SA 11.5 GBq mmol-1, 310 mCi mmol-1). Incubations 
were carried out for 2 hours at in situ temperature.  Cells were later collected on Poretics 
0.2 µm polycarbonate membranes and radioactivity was read in a liquid scintillation 
counter Beckman LS 6000 IC using UniverSol as the scintillation cocktail. For Tr 
determinations a tracer concentration of 43 nm of 14C-glucose was used. The incorporated 
fraction was determined after collection of cells on 0.2 µm Poretics polycarbonate 
membranes and the respired fraction was determined after acidification of the sample and 
capture of the 14CO2 on ethanolamine (Merck).  

 
 
Statistical analyses 
The significance of the effect of the sampling site on the variability of chlorophyll a, 

POC and bacteriological parameters was analysed by one-way ANOVA. Homogeneity of 
variances was verified by Levene tests. Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) was 
used for Post Hoc Multiple Comparison.  

Multiple correlation analysis was performed with the aim of extracting statistically 
significant relations between biological parameters describing bacterial abundance and 
activity on one side, and on the other, either distance to the margin or to the sediments. 

A multiple stepwise regression analysis was used to identify major environmental 
factors controlling tidal and transversal fluctuations of bacterial abundance and activity and 
to quantify their relative contribution to total variability. Temperature, salinity, seston, 
POC (total or as a percentage of seston) and chlorophyll a were used as independent 
variables. 

All statistical analyses were performed with the SPSSWin 7.1 package. 
 
 
3. Results 
 

Environmental variables 
The range of values of parameters related to water quality is summarized in Table 1. 

The numbers correspond to the average, minimum and maximum values registered at each 
sampling site during the series of six sampling moments during four tidal cycles. The 2 
sub-tidal sites (S3 and S4) were characterized by depths with tidal averages of 2.2-2.6 m in 
spring tides and 2.2 m in neap tides. The inter-tidal site S2 was only slightly shallower 
(tidal averages of 1.9-2.7 m) while the spatially fluctuating site S1 was defined through a

Temperature and salinity showed little variation along the transect as well as with 

depth. Seston varied within the range of 36-110 mg l-1. Maximal values were generally 
found at the bottom of the water column of the deeper site S4 while minima were often 
registered at surface.  

Chlorophyll a concentration varied from 0.2 to 7.0 µg l-1 (Figure 2). In each tidal 
cycle, minima occurred generally at the bottom of the water column and maxima at surface 
but no well established vertical or transversal pattern could be noticed. The tidal pattern 
was clear with decreasing concentrations in flood tide and increasing levels in ebbing 
water. POC concentration varied within the range of 2.0-8.5 mgC l-1 (Figure 2) with no 
distinct pattern of distribution with depth. Maxima were often found at site S1.

Bacterioplankton variables 
Total bacterial number (TBN) ranged 2.5-9.0 x 109 cell l-1 with maxima generally 

occurring at low tide and minima close to high tide (Figure 3). No distinct vertical or 
transversal patterns of variation were observed. The fraction of bacterial cells that were 
attached to particles (Figure 3) varied from 4 to 33 % of the total count s and was generally 
lower at high tide. Taking all the results respecting the 4 tidal cycles, the maximal 
percentage of attached bacteria was generally found in surface water. 

Maximal ectoenzymatic hydrolysis rates varied from 396 to 4190 nmol l-1 h-1 for 
AMPase and from 14.5 to 489.0 nmol l-1h-1 for BTGLase (Figure 4). AMPase maxima 
occurred generally in surface samples but BTGLase showed no distinct pattern in the

observed close to low tide.  

The partitioning of ectoenzymatic activities between free (&lt;1.2 µm) and attached 
(&gt;1.2 µm) cells revealed that the contribution of the attached bacterioplankton could be 
either undetectable or compose up to 83 or 98 % of total AMPase or BTGLase activities, 
respectively (Figure 5). Maximal percentage of particle-associated ectoenzymatic activity 
was more often found in bottom water samples. The contribution of attached cells to 
AMPase activity showed a slight tendency to decrease during flooding and to regain 
importance during ebbing. This pattern was clearer on the 30th May. Tidal variation of the

proportion of BTGLase activity associated with the &gt;1.2 µm fraction showed contrasting 
and non-conclusive tendencies in different tidal cycles particularly at surface water. 

Glucose Vm and Tr showed irregular patterns along the vertical and transversal 
profiles of the channel. Glucose Vm varied within the range of 0.1 to 23.3 nmol l-1h-1 and 
Tr varied from 0.9 to 38.3 % h-1 (Figure 6). The he terotrophic metabolism of glucose 
showed stimulation close to low tide. 

The results of one-way ANOVA show that the differences between sampling sites 
found in the values if chlorophyll a, POC and in parameters related to bacterial abundance 
and activity were generally not significant, with the exception of the specific Vm of 
glucose incorporation (Table 2). The means values of total and per cell ectoenzymatic 
activities and glucose incorporation at each sampling site are displayed in Figure 7.

The multiple correlation analysis showed that seston, POC and chlorophyll a were 
not significantly related with to the proximity to the sediment or with the proximity to the 
margin in the salt marsh area (Table 3). However, the cell- specific AMPase activity of 
attached cells (obtained as the ratio between AMPase in the &gt; 1.2 µm fraction and the 
abundance of attached cells), as well as cell-specific Vm of glucose incorporation 
(obtained as the ratio between glucose Vm and TBN), was inversely related to the distance 
to the sediment surface (Table 3). Cell-specific Vm of glucose incorporation was also 
negatively related to the distance to the margin.

The results of the stepwise multiple regressions are presented in Table 4. The set of 
independent variables used for the analysis explained only a small proportion (11 – 43 %) 
of the observed variability in different bacterioplankton parameters with the exception of 
the abundance of attached bacteria (adjusted R2 = 0.665).

ecosystems (Karner et al., 
1992; Shiah and Ducklow, 
1995; Hoppe et al., 1998; 
Murrell et al., 1999; Cunha et 
al., 2000). In this study, we 
were focused on tidal and 
transversal sources of 
variability rather than on 
longitudinal gradients. 

The results from ANOVA 
analysis indicated that in most 
cases, the differences in 
bacterial abundance and 
activity levels between distinct 
sampling sites were not 
significant after integration of 
data representing different tidal 
phases or tidal cycles. 

Even though the 
availability of particulate 
substrates did not seem to be 
directly controlled by local 
sediment resuspension or 
runoff, the multiple correlation analysis confirmed that the proximity to the salt-marsh 
edge and to the sediment surface favoured monomer uptake and protein degradation at the 
level of individual cells. Considering that a clear transversal pattern of variation of 
particulate compounds could not be established and that the turnover of glucose, and even 
protein degradation, are better related to the dissolved pool of organic matter, the results 
might be interpreted as an indication that DOM rather than POM is regulating bacterial 
metabolism at these interfaces. 

The next step was to check if variables describing the availability of particulate 
substrates were found among the major environmental factors controlling tidal and 
transversal variability of bacterial abundance, ectoenzymatic activity, glucose uptake and 
turnover. Stepwise multiple regression showed that the fraction of attached bacteria was 
negatively related to salinity and positively related to chlorophyll a (Table 4). These

relations were interpreted as an indication that processes of tidal transport of phytoplankton 
and colonized particles from upper sections of the estuary, rather than local inputs, are 
regulating the relative size of the attached bacterial community. The variability of the total 
size of the bacterial community remained mostly unexplained (adjusted R2 = 0.184) even 
though it showed a negative relation to POC and positive relation to chlorophyll a.  

Ectoenzymatic activities showed to be positively associated to chlorophyll a  
(Table 4) suggesting that primary production may be an important source of substrates. 
BTGLase showed negative relation to salinity as expected since it is generally considered 
that BTGLase is relatively more important in low salinity environments while AMPase is 
widespread along estuarine gradients (Murrell et al., 1999; Cunha et al., 2000). The 
absolute coincidence observed between factors related to total AMPase and BTGLase and 
the corresponding cell- specific activities indicates that the variations in total activity may 
correspond essentia lly to shifts in the levels of activity of the individual cells rather than in 
the total size of the community. The results also suggest that active attached bacterial cells 
were probably mostly transported from upper sections rather than locally imported from

the margins, as the proportion of 
ectoenzymatic activity associated to 
the &gt; 1.2 µm fraction was also 

negatively related to salinity (Table 
4). 

Although its source could not 
be directly related to the salt marshes 
or to the bottom sediments, POC 
showed significant, even though 
contrasting, relations to different 
variables describing heterotrophic 
bacterial activity. Carbohydrate 
degradation (BTGLase) was 
positively affected by the increase of 
POC but this last variable was 
negatively associated to the 
heterotrophic metabolism of glucose 
(glucose Vm and Tr). This indicates 

that inputs of particulate organic substrates were no t accompanied by the corresponding 
increase in the availability of monomers and suggesting that bacterial utilization of 
organic-C was limited by ectoenzymatic degradation of complex substrates.  

In the particular conditions of the shallow sections of the Aveiro lagoon, local 
resuspension and runoff may be less important as factors of substrate supply than the 
transport of particles from upstream. Considering that the nature of the sediment at transect 
I6, ranges from very coarse sand with 6 % (w/w) organic matter at the West margin, to fine 
sand with 2 % (w/w) organic matter at the East margin (Cunha et al., 1999) some 
transference of particles from the sediments to the water column could be anticipated. 
However, current speed at this section, as well as at most of the shallow sections of the 
estuary, is rather low, never exceeding 0.4 ms-1 (Dias et al., 2000). Low current speed may 
favour sedimentation during most part of the tidal cycle since susceptibility to resuspension 
is strongly driven by tidal forcing (Blanchard et al., 1997). In the conditions of the shallow 
brackish water section of the Ria de Aveiro, the benthic compartment as well as the salt 
marshes may well retain POM, as observed in other estuaries (Taylor and Allanson, 1995; 
Yin and Harrison, 2000).

Even if evidence for the transference of particles from the sediments and from the 
salt marshes to the water column was not found, the heterotrophic metabolism of glucose 
was stimulated in the water overlaying the sediment surface and close to the margins. The 
advection of simple organic substrates at these interfaces may explain these effects.  

Contrasting to the remova l of particles through sedimentation, considerable inputs of 
DOM to the water column may be expected since density displacement of interstitial water

causes the release of nutrients (Webster et al., 1996). This process has been directly related 
to the increase of dark oxygen uptake, glucose Vm and the turnover rate of amino acids by 
the bacterioplankton community in mesocosm experiments (von Bodungen et al., 1995). 
Hopkinson et al. (1998) could also establish a linear relation between bacterioplankton 
growth rates and the DOC concentration in the water, achieved after exposure to benthic 
sediments.  

Globally, the results show some relations between availability of particulate organic 
substrates (POC, chlorophyll a) and levels of bacterial activity. However, resuspension and 
runoff, understood in the strict sense of processes of transference of particulate materials, 
do not directly explain the dense populations established at the shallow sections of the 
estuary or the high heterotrophic activity rates here observed. Therefore we believe, even 
though in this study the characterization of DOM was not attempted, that dissolved carbon 
may be the major factor controlling vertical and transversal variations of bacterioplankton 
heterotrophic activity.

Abstract - The tidal dynamics of bacterioplankton communities at the outer section of a shallow estuary (Ria 
de Aveiro, Portugal) were studied during 6 fixed-point tidal cycles. Bacterial numbers  
(0.2 – 8.1 x 109 cells l-1), aminopeptidase activity (189 – 1662 nmol l-1h-1), ? -glucosidase activity  
(1.7 – 67.0 nmol l-1h-1) and potential glucose incorporation (0.48 – 3.99 nmol l-1h-1) varied according to a 
consistent pattern of enrichment during ebb-tide and showing decrease during flood tide.  
Fluxes of bacterioplankton populations and associated heterotrophic activities between the estuary and the 
coastal area during the time period equivalent to a tidal cycle were estimated from the water flux determined 
using a two -dimensional vertically integrated numerical model. The net fluxes estimated for the period 
equivalent to a tidal cycle ranged from -2.5 to +26.0 x 1016 bacterial cells. The net tidal fluxes of potential 
heterotrophic activities ranged from -80 to -10 mol h-1 for aminopeptidase, -1.10 to -0.33 mol h-1 for  
? -glucosidase and -0.18 to +0.03 mol h-1 for glucose incorporation. Net fluxes were generally negative in 
sign indicating the transfer of phyto- and bacterioplankton, as well as potential capacities for the degradation 
and recycling of organic matter, from the outer estuarine compartment to the sea. 

 
 
Key words: Estuarine bacterioplankton; tidal fluxes 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 

Estuaries are interface ecosystems that functionally couple continental and marine 

environments, receiving biogeochemically active inputs from land, rivers and the coastal 

sea. The estuarine environment is often reported as extremely productive, supporting dense 

bacterioplankton communities and high rates of primary production and bacterial 

heterotrophic activity (Barbosa, 1991; Fuks et al., 1991, Hoppe et al., 1996; Revilla et al., 

2000). The basic model of salt- marsh estuaries as exporting systems usually referred as the 

“Outwelling Hypothesis” (Odum, 1968; Dame et al., 1986) can be extended to incorporate 

the passive transport of living cells and their associated heterotrophic activities. 



Fluxes of bacterioplankton at the interface with the sea

Major transformations of the pools of organic and inorganic nutrients that reach the 

main body of the estuary are related to biological processes associated to bacterioplankton 

communities. (Billen and Garnier, 1997; Cloern, 2001). These, in their turn, strongly 

respond to environmental stimuli (Cunha et al., 2001), namely variations in nutrient 

availability (Hoppe et al., 1998). High fresh-water inputs and the corresponding increase in 

the concentration of labile organic compounds enhance the levels heterotrophic activity of 

estuarine bacteria (Murrell et al., 1999) and impose a river-driven seasonality on the way 

the estuary interacts with the nearby ocean (Cloern and Nichols, 1985). However, in 

estuaries where the processes of transport of materials are mostly driven by tidal forcing, 

the variability associated to the semi-diurnal time scale prevails over seasonal effects 

(Smith, 2001). The tidal flooding of salt marshes and mud-flats, and the advection of 

dissolved nutrients from the sediments stimulate bacterial activity in the water column 

(Trousellier, 1993; von Bodungen et al., 1995; Ritzrau et al., 1997) and are probably major 

factors underlying the persistence of dense and active bacterioplankton communities in 

shallow estuarine sections (Hoppe et al., 1996; Cunha et al., 2000). 

This work reports on an attempt to test in the field the hypothesis that in a shallow 

mesotidal estuarine system, such as Ria de Aveiro, exports of bacterioplankton and 

potential heterotrophic activities to the coastal ocean can occur under the summer regime 

of low fresh water input. With that aim, tidal dynamics of bacterioplankton were 

characterised in terms of (a) patterns of variability of abundance and activity and (b) sign 

and magnitude of the fluxes of cells and potential activities at the interface with the sea. 

 
 
2. Materials and methods  

 

Study area 

Ria de Aveiro (Figure 1) is a bar-built estuary (Pritchard, 1989), also described as a 

coastal lagoon, in the Northwest coast of Portugal. It is a complex system characterised by 

narrow channels and extensive intertidal zones. During spring tides, the maximal wet area 

is 83 km2 at high tide, reduced to 66 km2 at low tide (Dias et al., 2000). The estuary 

encompasses a total volume of water of approximately 160 Mm3 at high tide (Silva, 1994) 



Fluxes of bacterioplankton at the interface with the sea  
 

 91 

and the total river discharge during the period equivalent 

to a tidal cycle is 1.8 Mm3 (Moreira et al., 1993). The 

tidal range varies between 0.6 m in neap tides and 3.2 m 

in spring tides, with an average value of about 2 m (Dias 

et al., 2000).  

 

Study site 

The investigation was conducted inside the lagoon 

assuming that a sampling station located close to the 

mouth would fairly represent the properties of the water 

masses moving in and out the estuary. Station N1 

 (40º33’N; 8º45’W) was located in the main navigation 

channel, approximately 2 Km from the mouth (Figure 1). 

Sampling was performed during day-time along 5 spring 

tide cycles (01-06-96, 03-06-96, 28-08-96, 30-08-96 and 

02-09-97) and one neap tide cycle (10-09-97). In each 

tidal cycle, water samples were collected just below 

surface (0.2 m) at 6 tidal phases at approximately 2-hour 

intervals including one slack low tide (LT) and one slack 

high tide (HT), for no longer than 14 hours. Samples were 

kept cold and in the shade during transport to the 

laboratory. 

 

Physical and chemical parameters  

Temperature and salinity were measured with a WTW LF 196 Conductivity Meter 

and total depth of the water column was determined with a Sonar probe (Hondex PS-7 

LCD Digital Sounder).  

The determination of the concentration of suspended solids (seston) in estuarine 

samples was performed after filtration of 500 ml aliquots through Whatman GF/C (47 mm 

diameter) pre-weighted, pre-combusted filters. The filters were dried at 60 ºC for 24 hours 

and seston content was calculated as the increase in weight. Particulate organic matter

(POM) was determined through the difference in the weight of the dry seston filters after 4 

hours incineration at 525 ºC of the dry seston (Parsons et al., 1989).  

Chlorophyll a was quantified fluorimetrically (Yentsch and Menzel, 1963) in a Jasco 

FP-777 espectrofluorimeter. A total volume of 0.5 l of water was filtered through 

Whatman GF/C filters and later extracted with 10 ml of 90% acetone. Determinations were 

performed in 3 replicates of each sample. 

 

Microbiological parameters  

Total bacterial number (TBN) was determined by cell counting under 

epifluorescence microscopy after fixation of water samples with 2 % formaldehyde (final 

concentration). The samples (3 replicates) were then filtered through 0.2 µm black 

polycarbonate membranes (Poretics) and stained with 0.03 % acridine orange (Hobbie et 

al., 1977).  

The determination of maximum uptake velocity of glucose (glucose Vm) followed 

the procedure described by Gocke (1977) in 3 replicates and 1 blank of each sample. A 

final saturation concentration of 430 nM of 14C-glucose (Amersham SA 11.5 GBq mmol-1, 

310 mCi mmol-1) added to 10 ml aliquots was chosen after kinetic analysis was. 

Incubations were carried out for 2-3 hours at in situ temperature. Cells were collected on 

0.2 µm Poretics polycarbonate membranes and radioactivity was read in a liquid 

scintillation counter (Beckman LS 6000 IC) using UniverSol as scintillation cocktail.  

Ectoenzymatic activity was determined fluorimetrically (Jasco FP-777 Fluorometer) 

as the maximum hydrolysis rate (Hm) of model substrates (Sigma-Aldrich) for ? -

glucosidase (4- methylumbelliferyl-? -D-glucoside) and Leu-aminopeptidase (L- leucine-7-

amido-4-methyl-coumarin) according to Hoppe (1983). Saturation was achieved with  

1 mM of both substrates. Wavelengths for excitation and emission were respectively 380 

and 440 nm for MCA (7-amino-4-methylcoumarine) and 360 and 450 nm for MUF (4-

methylumbelliferone). Measurements were made in 3 replicates for each sample after 1-2 

hours incubations at in situ temperature. Calibration was performed by adding a series of 8 

concentrations of the fluorescent products (0-500 nM for MUF and 0-6 µM for MCA) to a 

pool of water from all the samples analysed in each day.

Estimation of estuarine fluxes 

The tidal balance of several water properties was estimated as the difference between 

the integrated ebb and flood tide flows through a transverse section of the channel defined 

at station N1. In order to determine estuarine fluxes in time periodic current fields, water 

flow and properties concentrations are usually measured in cross-sectional structures along 

the tidal cycle (Taylor and Allanson, 1995). Due to the very difficult working conditions at 

the station location, in this work determinations were only performed at a fixed depth 

corresponding to 0.2 m below surface, and at approximately 2-hours intervals. Ria de 

Aveiro is, however, vertically well- mixed and laterally homogeneous (Dias et al., 1999), 

and therefore it can be considered that the measured values fairly represent the structure of 

the correspondent property. In addition, Ria de Aveiro is a very shallow environment 

which makes adequate the use of vertically integrated numerical models to determine the 

integrated water flow. 

In this work a two-dimensional vertically- integrated numerical model (2DV) was 

applied. This solves the well-known shallow-water equations. This model was previously 

calibrated (Dias et al., 1998) and has been used in studies of tidal dynamics of the Ria de 

Aveiro (Dias et al., 2000), where it proved to be able to reproduce the tidal prism values 

computed by other authors for the main channels of Ria de Aveiro (Dias, 2001).  

The 2DV numerical model was used to compute time series of water flow (time-step 

of 40 s) through the transverse section of the channel including station N1, during each one 

of the tidal cycles. The slack water times were also determined from the numerical results, 

allowing the estimation of the time of null flux. Instantaneous cross-sectional fluxes of 

salinity, chlorophyll, POM, ectoenzymatic activities, glucose incorporation and bacterial 

abundance were estimated as the result of the product of the field data measured at a given 

time by the simultaneous numerically computed water flow. New values corresponding to 

the slack water time (null instantaneous fluxes) were also included.  

Both water flow and properties concentrations were considered to have nearly 

sinusoidal time evolution patterns in Ria de Aveiro (Hoppe et al., 1996; Cunha et al., 

2000). Consequently, it was expected that the fluxes of most properties could reveal a 

parallel temporal variation. Therefore, time series of instantaneous fluxes during a tidal 

cycle were produced by polynomial interpolation of the value of the products of the field

data by the numerical results, using a third degree polynomial approximation. As expected, 

these curves fited very well with the numerically computed water flow curves. Estuarine 

fluxes through the transverse section were later calculated integrating the ebb and flood 

tide series.

Depth at the station varied from a 

minimum of 4.6 m in low tide to 10 m in 

high tide. Water temperature (15.3-20.6 

ºC) generally decreased during flood tide 

and increased during ebbing. Salinity 

varied within the range of 23.7-35.9 

PSU. Salinity maxima and minima were 

always observed at high and low tide, 

respectively.  

Seston (17-222 mg l-1)  and POM 

(6-31 mg l-1) strongly fluctuated during 

the tidal cycles but a clear pattern could 

not be identified (Figure 2). Chlorophyll 

a ranged from 6.8 to 10.2 µg l-1 being 

the maximal values achieved at low tide 

(Figure 2). 

Total bacterial abundance varied 

between 0.2 and 8.1 x 109 cell l-1 (Figure 

3). Maximal values were more often 

found at low tide or 2 hours before.  

Glucose incorporation Vm (0.48- 

3.99 nmol l-1 h-1) followed a pattern 

similar to the variation of abundance 

with incorporation rates increasing 

towards low tide (Figure 3).  

The ranges of variation of the 

maximum hydrolysis rate were 189- 

1662 nmol l-1 h-1 for aminopeptidase and 

1.7-67.0 nmol l-1 h-1 for ? -glucosidase (Figure 3). The tidal pattern of variation was again 

characterised by increasing hydrolytic activity during ebbing and a decrease of activity 

during flood tide.

Estuarine fluxes 

The estimated values of the fluxes of materials and potential bacterial heterotrophic 

activities between the estuary and the ocean during the time period corresponding to one 

tidal cycle are represented in Figure 4.  

Fluxes of salt were predominantly positive ranging from –73 to +727 tons. Negative 

fluxes of chlorophyll a corresponded to a net export to the sea of 9 to 55 Kg per tidal cycle. 

Fluxes of POM were variable in sign ranging from –781 to +478 kg per tidal cycle.  

TBN and potential ectoenzymatic activities were consistently exported to the coastal 

sea. The absolute values of the net tidal fluxes were 3 to 26 x 1016 cells, 12 to 78 mol h-1 of 

potential aminopeptidase activity and 0.3 to 1.1 mol h-1 of potential ? -glucosidase activity, 

per cycle. The net flux of potential glucose incorporation was contrasting in sign between

4. Discussion 
 

Tidal bacterioplankton dynamics at the interface with the sea 

Ria de Aveiro is generally described as estuarine system with a complex topography. 

The location of station N1 was defined in order to allow the best approximation to the 

physical, chemical and biological properties of the water at the mouth of the estuary since 

the total volume of water that crosses this section corresponds to 90 % of the total tidal 

pris m (Silva, 1994). Since fieldwork at the highly turbulent section between the origin of 

Canal de Mira and the mouth proved to be impracticable for security reasons, the 

contribution of this channel was left out of the current study.  

The patterns of tidal variation of salinity and temperature observed at station N1 

indicate that daytime warming occurred as salinity decreased during ebbing. The lagoon 

has an average depth of 1 m and the shallow sections (&amp;lt;3 m) correspond to approximately  

95 % of the high tide wet area (Silva, 1994). This allows significant warming of the water 

column due to insolation, especially during the warm season. The net export of heat from 

the estuary to offshore waters was previously reported by Dias et al. (1999). 

The concentration of particulate matter did not follow a regular pattern along the 

tidal cycles. This uncoupling from salinity has also been reported for the variation of DOC 

at other temperate estuarine systems and is interpreted as an indication of tidally induced 

resuspension/sedimentation events that may exert a major control over the concentration of 

particles in the water column (Miller, 1999). However, in the Ria de Aveiro, like in other 

shallow estuarine systems, the sediment-bed and the salt marsh tend to retain particles and 

export solutes (Newell and Krambeck, 1995; Almeida et al., accepted for publication). 

Assuming that POC corresponds to 50 % of the POM (Rodier, 1996) and using a factor of 

50 to convert chlorophyll to phytoplankton–C (Eppley et al., 1977), we can estimate that 

POC corresponds to 4-19 % of the seston and that phytoplankton biomass corresponds to 

6-14 % of the POC. These values fit within the ranges usually reported for productive

coastal ecosystems (Charpy et al., 1997; Canuel and Zimmerman, 1999). The high organic 

content of suspended matter may be related to inputs of inorganic nutrients and labile 

DOM at the mid- and inner-estuarine sections that cause the increase of phyto- and 

bacterioplankton biomasses to values that are up to 9 times higher than at the outer section 

(Cunha et al., 2000). Tidal transport of cells from upper sections of the estuary induced a 

regular pattern characterised by an ebb-tide enrichment in phyto- (1.3 – 1.4 fold) and 

bacterioplankton (1.1 – 10 fold). 

Bacterial potent ial ectoenzymatic activity and glucose incorporation also increased at 

station N1 during ebbing and decreased during flood. However, tidal fluctuation of activity 

variables was less pronounced than the fluctuation of bacterial abundance. This 

conservative tidal fluctuation of activity parameters when compared with the fluctuation of 

abundance at station N1 may result from the anti-parallel fluctuation of total abundance 

and specific activity of bacterial cells. Experimental data referring bacterial communities 

of this estuarine system indicate that bacterioplankton heterotrophic activity strongly 

responds to changing water properties and is negatively affected by salinity (Cunha et al., 

2001). According to this scenario, the activity of individual cells and the viability of the 

community may decrease at station N1 during ebbing, as total abundance increases with 

upper estuarine inputs. On the contrary, when ocean water is entering the estuary, the 

density of the community is decreasing but cells are probably gaining vigour in response to 

the rising nutrient availability.  

 

Fluxes between the estuary and the coastal oceanic area 

Estuarine impacts on coastal ocean often result in the formation of plumes of 

elevated chlorophyll concentration, bacterial abundance, biomass production, nitrification, 

and total community respiration (Bianchi et al., 1999a; Bianchi et al., 1999b; Malone and 

Ducklow, 1990; Pakulski et al., 2000). The attempt to quantify fluxes of salt and biogenic 

elements between the Aveiro estuarine system and the adjacent Atlantic coast during the 

summer period showed a consistent seaward flux of bacterioplankton cells and potential 

heterotrophic activity.  

The magnitude of the exports from the estuary to the sea reflects the total size and 

activity of estuarine communities and also the balance between marine and freshwater 



Fluxes of bacterioplankton at the interface with the sea

inputs to the main body of the estuary during each tidal cycle. The fluxes of bacterial cells 

and AMPase activity calculated for the studied 1996 tidal cycles decreased from early to 

mid summer, when salt imports increased, probably as consequence of the reduction in 

freshwater inputs during the warm season (Simpson et al., 2001). ? -GLCase showed a 

more irregular temporal pattern. Since this ectoenzymatic capacity is often reported as 

being particularly associated to low-salinity bacterial communities (Murrel et al., 1999), 

processes of activation and deactivation of the corresponding enzymes may be 

superimposed on transport effects. 

The fluxes of particulate materials at the estuarine-ocean interface are more irregular 

in sign probably reflecting physical processes of re-allocation of sediments by tidal and/or 

residual currents (Cloern and Nichols, 1985). Maximum current speed at the mouth of the 

estuary ranges 0.6-2.4 m s-1, (average  of 1.2 m s-1) depending on tidal range and other 

hydrographical conditions (Dias et al., 2000). During the tidal cycle a succession of 

conditions for resuspension, transport and deposition of particles may occur. Also, the 

frequent disturbance of the channel bed by dredging works at this section of intense 

navigation traffic may interfere with tidal fluxes of suspended sediments.  

The comparison between biogenic estuarine fluxes under spring and neap tide 

conditions is not conclusive. Results may indicate that other factors, rather than tidal range, 

are prevailing on the magnitude of the net estuarine fluxes. Neap tide exports, when 

compared to spring tide, corresponded to a 6-fold increase in chlorophyll, a 32 % decrease 

in bacterial cells and a 63 % decrease of potential ? -glucosidase activity. On the contrary, 

neap tide had no significant impact on the export of potential aminopeptidase activity, in 

relation to spring tide values, and coincided with a shift in the sign of the fluxes of salt and 

POM. Short-term variations of the same order of magnitude were also observed in the 

1996 cycles, which corresponded to tides of similar range (2.8-3.0 m). The two pairs of 

cycles separated by 1-day intervals provide a perception of the amplitude of short-term 

variability not related to changes in tidal range. The results may indicate that other factors 

controlling the size and activity of bacterioplankton inside the estuary and/or the 

mechanisms of estuarine water circulation exert major influence on the processes of 

transference between the estuary and the sea. 



Fluxes of bacterioplankton at the interface with the sea  
 

 101 

In spite of the controversy on Odum’s outwelling hypothesis (Odum, 1968) 

regarding the contribution of salt-marsh estuaries to the export of organic matter to the 

open marine environment (Dame et al., 1986), this study brings evidence to the supply of 

the coastal area with enriched bacterial communities and increased potential capacity for 

the degradation and recycling of organic matter brought from the shallow estuary of Ria de 

Aveiro. It was demonstrated that these exports occur during periods of low fresh water 

inputs, when the salt balance corresponded to a net retention of marine water inside the 

lagoon. Estuarine fluxes of bacterial cells and associated heterotrophic activities are most 

probably supported by dense and active inner-estuarine communities and are, therefore, 

highly dependent on the reactivity of bacterioplankton communities and on processes of 

stimulation or deactivation of heterotrophic capacities during transport along the estuarine 

gradient.

CHAPTER VII 

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
 

Preliminary assumptions and methodological options  

 
The main feature underlying the field and laboratory work hereby reported is the 

metabolic reactivity of the heterotrophic estuarine bacterioplankton under unstable 
environmental conditions. 

The strategies adopted and the design of the fieldwork were based on the 
fundamental assumption that estuarine interfaces with the riverine environment, the littoral 
zones, the bottom sediments and the coastal ocean were sites of enhanced instability. The 
collection of samples should be conducted is such a way that spatial, chemical and/or 
temporal variations could be fairly represented. However, the selection of the sampling 
sites is not exempt of criticism and some of the options are worth discussing in face of the 
particular morphological and hydrographical features of the study area. 

The Ria de Aveiro is a bar-built estuary (Pritchard, 1967), sometimes referred as a 
coastal lagoon, that has a very irregular and complex geometry characterized by extensive 
intertidal zones and by an intricate net of narrow and shallow channels. The estuary is 
connected to the ocean by an artificial channel 1.3 km long, 350 m wide and ~20 m deep 
(Dias et al., 2000). The Ria corresponds to a mesotidal estuary (Davies, 1964) with a tidal 
range that is minimum in neap tides (0.6 m) and maximal in spring tides (3.2 m) (Dias et 
al., 1999). The tidal prim at the mouth and in spring tides is 83 Mm3 and the estuary 
encompasses a total volume of water of ~160 Mm3 in high tide (Silva, 1994). The total 
river discharge during the period equivalent to a tidal cycle is 1.8 Mm3 (Moreira et al., 
1993). No significant signs of vertical stratification in terms of temperature and salinity are 
generally detected so the estuary is considered as well mixed (Dias et al., 1999). Four 
channels originate from the main navigation channel with a correspondent distribution of 
the tidal prism of 38 % for Canal de S. Jacinto (North), 26 % for Canal do Espinheiro 
(Northeast), 10 % for Canal de Mira (South) and 8 % for Canal de Ílhavo (Southeast) 
(Silva, 1994). Maximum current speed at the mouth of the estuary ranges 0.6 – 2.4 ms-1, 
depending on hydrographical conditions, but at the shallow sections of the channels it 
never exceeds 0.4 ms-1 (Dias et al., 2000).  



Discussion and conclusions 
 

 106 

A first option corresponded to the definition of the extreme points of the estuary, 
which would represent the estuarine interfaces with the river and with the sea. The gateway 
to the sea should ideally be defined at the mouth of the Ria, right between peers. However, 
the strong currents, the frequent dredging of the channel bed and the intense navigation 
made anchoring at this section impracticable. According to Silva (1994) the volume of 
water corresponding to the tidal prism at the first section of the main navigation channel 
(83 Mm3) is much larger that the volume that remains in low tide (28 Mm3) so an extensive 
renovation of the water contained in this section during each tidal cycle was assumed. 
Therefore, a sampling station located approximately 1.5 km inwards to the mouth was 
selected to represent the interface with the sea (station N1). During tidal cycles, the small 
boat used during sampling was kept at a fixed position by attaching it to a navigation buoy, 
which was not positioned at the centre of the channel but slightly oriented towards the east 
margin. It is possible that during ebbing, the water properties at this site were more 
affected by the flux associated with Canal de Ílhavo than with either Canal de S. Jacinto or 
Canal do Espinheiro. Canal de Mira originates very close to the mouth and its contribution 
to the variability of bacterioplankton activity was excluded by the option of establishing 
the interface with the sea at station N1. 

In order to characterize the responses of bacterioplankton to an estuarine gradient, 
and considering that the Ria has an intricate topography, it become necessary to define a 
model sub-estuary (Canal de Ílhavo) within the complex estuarine system. Some important 
attributes of Canal de Ílhavo were taken into consideration: (1) Canal de Ílhavo connects to 
a permanent fresh water stream at its upper end which, even though it is not a major fresh 
water affluent to the estuary (~5 % of total freshwater inputs), creates a distinct salinity 
gradient; (2) earlier studies developed along this channel provided preliminary information 
on the longitudinal patterns of variation of hydrographical variables such as temperature, 
salinity and sediment texture (Rodrigues, 1992); (3) although it is the shortest of the main 
branches of the lagoon (~15 km length), Canal the Ílhavo fairly represents the diversity of 
intertidal biotopes that occur within the estuarine system; (4) there is a marked shift in 
anthropogenic pressure associated to the margins from the outer (harbour facilities) to the 
inner sections (aquaculture ponds, industrial plants, diffuse domestic sewage inputs) of the 
channel; (5) the channel is accessible from the margins along almost all the extension and 
navigation is also possible in small recreation boats; (6) it is located within a short distance 
from the laboratory allowing a rapid processing of collected samples. 

 
 



Discussion and conclusions

Bacterioplankton reactivity to changing water properties 

 
Evidence for the high reactivity of bacterial communities to the changing properties 

of the water column was obtained from the analysis of field results and confirmed in 
laboratory experiments. 

Assuming that Canal de Ílhavo represents the estuarine gradients of salinity and 
nutrient availability established in the Ria de Aveiro, the results indicate that the peaks of 
bacterioplankton abundance and activity occur at sections of intermediate salinity (20- 
-30 PSU). This corresponds to a curvilinear pattern also observed in other temperate 
estuaries (Wright and Coffin, 1983; Palumbo et al., 1984; Fuks et al., 1991; Bordalo et al., 
1998). However, the salinity range corresponding to maxima in bacterial heterotrophic 
potential in the Ria is higher than in other estuaries where maxima occur at 3-10 PSU 
(Palumbo and Ferguson, 1978; Painchaud et al., 1995) or at 5-25 PSU (Pakulski et al., 
2000). The longitudinal pattern obtained in Canal de Ílhavo may not accurately reflect the 
distribution of bacterioplankton in the complex estuarine system of the Ria. The annual 
average of the freshwater flux associated to Rio Boco during the period equivalent to a 
tidal cycle, corresponds to only ~1.5 % of the tidal prism at the outer section of this 
channel (Silva, 1994) and the unbalance between fresh and salt water inputs is enhanced 
dur ing the warm season. Considering that the fieldwork along the estuarine gradient was 
conducted during late spring, the patterns of bacterioplankton abundance and activity are 
probably biased by the seasonal preponderance of marine influences.  

The transition from the river to the main body of the estuary at the upper end of 
Canal de Ílhavo was characterised by a marked change in the characteristics of 
bacterioplankton communities, both in terms of size and of activity rates. The pattern of 
increasing abundance, potential peptide degradation and monomer uptake with decreasing 
salinity was interrupted between the two inner stations of the profile (I8 and Rio Boco). 
However, in spring tide, the strong marine influence associated to flood current produced a 
marked increase in salinity along the profile and extended the biological continuum to the 
upper station. Under different hydrological situations, total bacterial counts, rates of 
leucine-aminopeptidase (Leu-AMPase) activity and glucose uptake in Rio Boco were 
lower than in the adjacent estuarine section thereby confirming the mid-estuarine origin of 
the densest and more active bacterioplankton populations. 

The pattern defined by the longitudinal variation of ? -glucosidase (? -GLCase) 
activity at the riverine interface was somewhat distinct. The highest activity rates were 
consistently achieved at Rio Boco indicating that in the Ria, like in other coastal systems, 



Discussion and conclusions 
 

 108 

? -GLCase activity was negatively related to salinity (Murrell et al., 1999). It also indicates 
that the relative importance of carbohydrates as substrate sources decreased seawards. On 
the contrary, salinity played a minor role in the regulation of Leu-AMPase activity. The 
maximum rates of Leu-AMPase activity were always higher than the maximum rates of  
? -GLCase as it also happens in other coastal and estuarine environments (Rath et al., 1993; 
Christian and Karl, 1995; Murrel et al., 1999). The shift in the pattern of polymer 
utilisation that occurred along the estuarine gradient was expressed as an increase of the 
ratio Leu-AMPase:? -GLCase. This ratio was 9-33 at the riverine interface and 35-48 at the 
interface with the sea. Changes in the relative importance of different ectoenzymes occur 
within estuarine gradients and reflect a change in the spectra of available substrates 
(Schulz Jr and Ducklow, 2000). Therefore, the transition from carbohydrate- utilising to 
protein- utilising communities was interpreted as an indication of the variation in the 
composition of the pool of utilizable organic matter between different estuarine sections.  

The rates of Leu-AMPase in the Ria were in the high range of the values found in 
other estuarine and coastal waters (Hoppe, 1983; Rego et al., 1985; Hoppe et al., 1998). 
The exceptional potential for peptide degradation ma y result from the high anthropogenic 
inputs associated to the main body of the lagoon but may also reflect the utilisation of 
organic compounds as sources of nitrogen. The bacterioplankton of the Ria does not 
strictly depend upon phytoplankton primary production for carbon supply (Almeida* et al., 
accepted) but may strongly compete with the dense phytoplankton communities for 
nitrogen (Chin-Leo and Benner, 1992). The high rates of peptide degradation may indicate 
that combined amino acids are intensely utilised as organic sources of nitrogen by the 
bacterioplankton of the Ria.  

The variation of the rates of bacterioplankton-associated activities at the interface 
with the sea conducted to a consistent pattern of increase during ebb and decrease during 
flood tide. Along the longitudinal profile the tidal fluctuation of the variables describing 
heterotrophic activity was more pronounced than the fluctuation of cell abundance, 
reinforcing the non-conservative behaviour of planktonic bacteria during tidal transport.  

The hypothesis that bacterial communities respond to changing water properties by 
shifting between levels of activity within time scales compatible with tidal effects 
originating the characteristic longitudinal patterns of activity, was tested in laboratory. The 
use of diffusion chambers allowed the assessment of the degree of environmental 
regulation of activity rates by reciprocally exposing bacterial assemblages from different 
estuarine sections to contrasting water properties. Activity rates of the tested communities 
markedly shifted within the 6-hour exposure periods whereas bacterial abundance

 109 

remained fairly stable. The results for ectoenzymatic activity (Leu-aminopeptidase and ? -
glucosidase), glucose incorporation and biomass production after transference of the 
marine bacterial community to brackish water showed maxima in the range of 241-384 % 
of the control values. The opposite transference of the brackish-water bacterial community 
to marine water produced maximal decreases to 0.14-0.58 % of the control values. There 
was a concomitant increase in the CTC-active fraction of the marine community 
transferred to brackish water and a decrease in the proportion of active cells in the brackish 
water community transferred to marine water (Almeida et al., 2001). This indicates that 
changes in total activity rates correspond to the superimposition of the variation of the size 
of the active fraction of the total community and of the activity levels of individual cells 
probably by shifting between enzymatic systems with distinct kinetic characteristics 
(Unanue et al., 1999). 

Ectoenzymatic activities were less affected by the experimental shifting in water 
properties, in coherence with the results obtained in the field, along the estuarine gradient 
and during tidal cycles at the interface with the sea. The parameters describing the 
heterotrophic metabolism of glucose (Vm and Tr) were more reactive to tidal transport 
than the potential rates of Leu-AMPase and ? -GLCase. Ectoenzymatic activity and 
monomer uptake reflect different metabolic processes and are differently controlled by the 
availability and quality of the pool of organic matter. The higher degree of reactivity of the 
uptake of monomers may indicate that the proportion of low molecular weight substrates 
within the DOM pool may vary significantly between the mid and outer sections of the 
estuary. 

 
 

Major factors of regulation of bacterioplankton activity in Ria de Aveiro 

 
Temperature and phytoplankton standing stocks were two of the major identified 

sources of variability of bacterioplankton heterotrophic activity. The combined influence 
of temperature, chlorophyll concentration and salinity explained ~80 % of the geographic 
variability of bacterial abundance. However, the contribution of these factors to the 
variability of parameters of bacterial activity was rather modest. The metabolic indicators 
related to monomer uptake, which were identified as the more reactive to environmental 
pressure, were not significantly associated to salinity or phytoplankton biomass, and 
temperature could not explain more than ~30 % of total variability. Under constant 
temperature, monomer uptake exhibited the strongest responses to experimental changing

of water. The control of bacterial activity in diffusion chamber experiments was restricted 
to the dissolved water properties supporting the thesis that bacterioplankton reactivity in 
the Ria is probably determined by short term variations of salinity and, in a major extent, 
by the size and composition of the DOM pool. 

Phytoplankton standing stocks were positively associated with bacterioplankton 
abundance and efficiency of glucose incorporation. However, during the warm season, the 
secondary production of bacterial biomass is not limited by photosynthesis. In fact, 
bacterial carbon demand corresponded to ~20 % of the primary production in the water 
column determined in late spring (Almeida* et al., accepted). The low dependence of 
bacterioplankton on autochthonous primary production and the high availability of organic 
substrates for bacterial growth during late spring and summer can also be inferred by the 
uncoupling between polymer degradation and monomer uptake. Maximum rates of glucose 
and leucine incorporation correspond respectively to 1-13 % of the ? -GLCase and  
0.01-14 % of the Leu-AMPase associated supply of monomers, in terms of carbon. The 
uncoupling between phytoplankton primary production and bacterial secondary production 
as well as between polymer hydrolysis and monomer uptake occurs at high nutrient 
concentrations (Middelboe et al., 1995; Hoppe et al., 1998) and was interpreted as a 
consequence of the high degree of eutrophication of the Ria during the warm season. 

Particulate organic matter inputs are sometimes related to high rates of bacterial 
activity in shallow environments (Chróst and Riemann, 1994) and estuarine turbidity 
maxima correspond to sections of elevated contribution of bacterial to total plankton 
biomass and organic matter degradation (Fuks et al., 1991). No clear turbidity maximum 
could be defined within the high biological activity section corresponding to the  
20-30 PSU range. However, the resuspension of bottom sediments and the particle- loaded 
runoff from the mud flats had been previously vented as on of the possible determinants of 
the dramatic increase of turbidity and of the high microbial activities and relatively low 
primary production in low tide (Hoppe et al., 1996). The field approaches failed to 
demonstrate significant relations between POC concentrations and bacterioplankton 
heterotrophic activities. The fraction of particle-attached bacteria varied between 4 and  
33 % of the total number, with no significant relation with either POC or chlorophyll. The 
relative contribution of attached cells (&gt; 1,2 µm) to ectoenzyme activities was highly 
variable ranging from ~0 to 98 % of total Leu-AMPase and from ~0 to 83 % of ? -GLCase. 
Positive relations of bacterioplankton abundance and activity to phytoplankton biomass in 
the absence of clear relations with particulate sources of organic matter suggests that the

control is either exerted through algal exudates or that it corresponds to a parallel response 
of phyto- and bacterioplankton communities to gradients of inorganic nutrients. 

No clear vertical or transversal patterns of POC or chlorophyll could be defined at the 
shallow fine-sediment mid-section of Canal de Ílhavo suggesting a minor contribution of 
local sediment resuspension and runoff to the supply of particles to the water column, 
under a slow tidal current regime. The indication that POM plays a secondary role in the 
regulation of bacterioplankton metabolism is coherent with laboratory evidence for the 
preponderance of dissolved factors in the reactivity of bacterial communities towards 
environmental variability. The advection of simple orga nic substrates at benthic and littoral 
interfaces, by density displacement of interstitial water (Webster et al., 1996), may account 
for considerable inputs of DOM to the water column and contribute to the high rates of 
activity in shallow biotopes (von Bodungen et al., 1995) such as those prevailing in Ria. 

 
 

The importance of biological processes in the water column in the context of a shallow 
estuarine system 

 
For the assessment of the relative contribution of the water column to the total system 

metabolism it is important to consider that the estuarine system of the Ria de Aveiro has an 
average depth of 1 m, that the shallow section (&amp;lt;3m) correspond to ~95 % the high tide 
wet area (estimated from Silva, 1994) and that the sediments are generally characterised by 
bacterial densities 3 orders of magnitude superior to those observed the water column 
(Alcântara et al., 1996).  

The magnitude of planktonic processes, standardised to surface units, exhibits a 
higher degree of short-term variability than that of the benthic compartment because of the 
tidal variation of depth. The sediments of the Ria are 9-71 times more active in organic 
matter aerobic mineralization than the water column, in a per volume unit basis (Alcântara 
et al., 1996). However, the plankton accounts for 66-90 % of the total oxygen consumption 
per surface unit at sub-tidal areas. The contribution of bacteria to oxygen consumption, 
either in the plankton or in the benthos, was not established. In sediments, the contribution 
of microorganisms to total oxygen consumption tends to decrease towards shallower 
biotopes (Piepenburg et al., 1995). Sulphate reduction seems to be the major pathway for 
organic carbon mineralization in shallow sandy sediments whereas denitrification gains 
relevance in finer and deeper sediments (Rysgaard et al., 2000). The major contribution to 
oxygen consumption in estuarine waters is associated&amp;lt;1 µm size classes (Griffith et al.,

1990) but bacterial growth efficiency decreases with increasing eutrophication (del Giorgio 
and Cole, 1998). In the conditions of the Ria, and considering the evidences for the high 
availability of organic matter in the water column, an important contribution of 
bacterioplankton for total respiration should be expected.  

 
 

Biogenic fluxes between the estuary and the sea 
 
The patterns of organic matter utilisation along the estuarine gradient and the 

reactivity of heterotrophic bacterioplankton at the interface with the sea are major 
determinants of the impacts of the Ria on adjacent coastal waters. 

Considerable amounts of labile DOC can be exported from estuaries where the 
residence time is short when compared to organic matter turnover time (Raymond and 
Bauer, 2000). The residence time estimated for the mid and inner sections of Canal de 
Ílhavo varies with season but generally corresponds to several weeks (Silva, 1994). In 
these conditions, the lability of organic substrates may considerably decrease with 
increasing proximity to the sea. Bacteria reaching the outer section of the estuary respond 
to higher salinity and to lower substrate quality by shifting to activity levels that are lower 
than expected by conservative dilution. On the contrary, a more favourable environment 
reactivates communities entering the estuary during flood tide.  

The balance of the tidal exchange of water between the estuary and the ocean 
corresponded to a net seaward flux of bacterial cells and associated activities. The biogenic 
exports from the Ria to the sea persisted even during periods of net retention of marine 
water.  

 
Unanswered questions  

 
Two important aspects of the regulation of bacterioplankton activity in the estuarine 

system of the Ria de Aveiro could not be satisfactorily clarified.  
The first refers to the role of DOM in the regulation of the processes of polymer 

hydrolysis and monomer uptake. The characterization of the DOM in terms of major 
estuarine sources, range of concentrations, spectra of compounds and bioavailability, as 
well as the evaluation of the relative importance of DOM and POM in the supply of 
nutrients for bacterioplankton growth are emerging investigation areas that will provide 
new insights into the dynamics of heterotrophic estuarine bacterioplankton.  



Discussion and conclusions 
 

 113 

The second aspect regards the co-existence of distinct communities highly adapted to 
the prevailing conditions at extreme sections of the estuary and the possibility that shifts in 
the levels of activity may correspond to changes in community composition. The 
experimental exposure to contrasting water properties revealed the plastic behaviour of 
mixed communities suggesting a high degree of environmental modulation of the 
expression of bacterial activities. However, the distinct reversibility of the effects caused 
by exposure to contrasting water of marine and brackish water communities may be 
interpreted as an indication of the existence of communities with different tolerance to 
salinity. The genetic characterization of the bacterioplankton communities of the Ria by 
culture- independent techniques would certainly bring decisive information on the subject. 

 
 

Conclusions  

 
The planktonic compartment is the major contributor to the aerobic degradation of 

organic matter in the sub tidal areas in the shallow estuarine system of the Ria de Aveiro. 
Although the Ria comprehends extensive areas of shallow channels and intertidal zones 
(salt marshes and mud flats) the resuspension of bottom sediments and the run off from 
intertidal zones appeared to play a minor role in the regulation of bacterial processes in the 
water column. 

The bacterial component of the plankton responded intensely and within short-time 
intervals to shifts in environmental factors and the establishment of a clear longitudinal 
pattern of variation resulted from the reactivity of the expression of heterotrophic activity 
rates during tidal transport. The main body of the estuary, corresponding to the 20-30 PSU 
range, showed the highest bacterial abundance and heterotrophic potential for the 
ectoenzymatic degradation of polymers and for the uptake of monomers.  

The levels of heterotrophic activity of bacterioplankton decreased at both riverine and 
oceanic boundaries, more than expected from conservative dilution, therefore confirming 
the reactive nature of bacterial metabolism in the highly unstable estuarine interfaces. 
There was also a shift in the patterns of organic matter utilization from a C-dependent 
metabolism at the less saline sections to an increasing relevance of N-dependence towards 
the outer section. 

Laboratory experiments demonstrated that the environmental regulation of the 
activity of natural bacterial assemblages from contrasting estuarine sections is mainly

sources of variability.
