agradecimentos /
acknowledgements

Ending a work like this is the culmination of a long “journey”. However, its
results would be undoubtedly different without the collaboration of several
people and entities, which help and support is materialized throughout this
thesis.
First of all I would like to acknowledge the director of IPIMAR, for accepting
the development of this study in the facilities of this Institute. It would
be virtually impossible to do all the fieldwork without the logistic support
of the institution, namely concerning diving. Even though displaced
from Universidade de Aveiro, the university provided the necessary
infrastructures at every solicitation and the staff of all the services that
I used were always extremely helpful and dedicated to solve all sorts of
problems. I am also extremely grateful to FCT - Fundação para a Ciência
e Tecnologia - for funding a scholarship during a four-year period (SFRH/
BD/29491/2006).
My supervisors, Dr. Marina Cunha (University of Aveiro) and Dr. Miguel
Neves dos Santos (INRB, I.P./IPIMAR) supported and guided me during
this entire “journey” and were always available for bureaucratic and
scientific demands. Their contributions were invaluable at all phases of the
thesis, directing me towards the objectives of my research and focusing my
efforts as needed. Furthermore, they were complementary, providing me a
wide array of knowledge and experience that I tried to acquire, and, when
needed, motivated me to contact people that could help with my questions.
To both of you, thank you for the friendship and endless support during the
last years.
I am extremely grateful to Dr. Pablo Gonzalez from Universidad de Sevilla,
who helped me on the study of the reproductive cycle of gorgonians and
patiently answered all sorts of questions regarding cnidarians. His devotion
to science is such that every time I visited him at Sevilla, I wanted to do
new things and spend more time in the lab trying to solve new problems
and elaborate new hypothesis.
To Jorge Gonçalves, Pedro Monteiro and Carlos Afonso for sharing their
data, for the opportunity to conduct studies that were not programmed
initially but most of all for their enthusiasm in discussing our underwater
observations, which definitely contributed for a more exact and solid
understanding of the patterns, diversity and processes that structure and
govern the benthic communities in rocky areas of the Algarve.
I am also grateful to Dr. Miguel Gaspar, for sharing his knowledge on
various fishing effects on the benthic communities of the Algarve, but more
important, for helping me, for motivating me and share my interest on the
subjects that I worked on. His contagious joy was also extremely important
to counter-balance set backs.
To Pedro Lino, my main dive buddy but also Marco Cerqueira and Sérgio
Amorim for diving and helping in the underwater fieldwork. Special thanks
are due to Pedro Lino as my main advisor in underwater techniques,
computer related things and brainstorming on my research issues. Thanks
also for all the rides home that provided me the extra time needed to finalize
many tasks.





To my colleagues from the laboratory of benthos in IPIMAR, Rita
Constantino, Fábio Pereira, Marco Cerqueira, Ana Moura and Marisa
Barata for their friendship and help on the laboratory, especially for the
real partnership atmosphere. To Paulo Vasconcelos for his friendship, the
numerous advices on analysis and scientific writing but also for revising
drafts of parts of this thesis. Special thanks are due to Marco Cerqueira,
because he was a real globe trotter, helping me during dives, logistics and
maintenance work and those other things that I now cannot remember...
To Jorge Ramos for the help on understanding some of the socio-
economical aspects related to the sea. To Alexandre Pereira and Cláudia
Roque for their friendship, interest and, jointly with Jorge Ramos, numerous
and diversified talks during lunch breaks. To Paula Moura for the help
during histological procedures and enormous patience to discuss and
remind me the techniques.
To the technicians José Luís Sofia and Tibério Simões who were always
available for helping me during sampling campaigns and all kinds of logistic
nightmares. Their experience saved me many headaches and set backs.
To all the other colleagues of IPIMAR, thank you for your friendship.
To all the developers and maintainers of the open source software,
especially LATEXand R and their libraries and packages. Thanks also for
all the altruistic people that post the answers to questions that arise while
using these scientific helpers.
To my friends from Aveiro and Coimbra: Ana Ré, Ascensão Ravara,
Andrea Baptista, Nuno Branco, Hermínia Castro, Leandro Sampaio,
Margarida Clemente, Maria João Almeida and Susana Silva, although
spatially distant were always supportive and present. Thank you for your
friendship!
To my closest family, but especially to my parents that always supported
me, giving me the confidence to proceed, to adventure myself but assuring
that my safe port is present and always near... I continue to be completely
overwhelmed by your endless love!

To my wife Susana, thanks for everything! Without your support I
would never have concluded this adventure. You were always supportive...
your many complaints were but a few, considering what you had to put
up with... and they were fair! Especially in the final part of the thesis, you
showed incredible stamina and capacity, but most of all, sympathy and real
partnership, reviewing, discussing and helping in whatever I needed. You
were my stronghold and the very first to always help me when I needed
most. Thank you for everything!

Finally to my beloved son Martim. Thank you Martim for being the
greatest joy of my life! I am sorry for every time that I could not play football
or build a Lego with you because I was working. I hope that you can forgive
me on that! You are the best son that a man can dream of and every time
you surprise me, or annoy me or make me laugh, is a moment that I have
lived fully, that boosts me to excel myself. You fulfil my heart with endless
love and I cannot resist to your charms... You make my day, every day!

resumo /
summary

O papel ecológico das gorgónias (Octocorallia: Alcyonacea) nos fundos
marinhos rochosos é mundialmente reconhecido. Contudo, a informação
acerca da ecologia e biologia das espécies de gorgónias nas zonas
temperadas do NE Atlântico é manifestamente escassa, especialmente
tendo em consideração as actuais perturbações globais, regionais e
locais. Nos fundos rochosos da costa algarvia até aos 30 m, verificou-
se que várias espécies de gorgónias são abundantes e frequentes,
nomeadamente Eunicella labiata, Eunicella gazella, Eunicella verrucosa,
Leptogorgia lusitanica e Leptogorgia sarmentosa. As populações de
gorgónias são co-dominadas por diferentes espécies que apresentaram
elevados índices de associação, indicando reduzidos níveis de competição
entre elas. Em todo o caso, a estrutura dos povoamentos diferiu
com as condições locais. Todas as espécies evidenciaram padrões
de distribuição semelhantes ao longo do gradiente de profundidade,
i.e. a abundância aumenta significamente com a profundidade após
os 15 m. A profundidades mais baixas (até aos 15 m), a distribuição
das gorgónias parece ser condicionada por factores abióticos e pela
competição com algas. Com efeito, os padrões de distribuição espacial
das espécies de gorgónias na costa algarvia são determinados pela
interacção de pressões naturais e antropogénicas (ex. pesca). Ainda que
as colónias de maior tamanho não tenham sido restritas a áreas menos
pescadas, em áreas mais perturbadas pela pesca, a distribuição dos
tamanhos das colónias estava maioritariamente desviada para tamanhos
mais pequenos. Os efeitos das perturbações naturais nas populações de
gorgónias foram evidenciados pela ocorrência de padrões demográficos
distintos em áreas vizinhas sujeitas a níveis semelhantes de pressões
antropogénicas. Estes estudos demonstraram, ainda, que os efeitos na
distribuição de frequências de tamanho das colónias são dependentes
das espécies de gorgónias em causa: Eunicella labiata não parece
ser afectada; Leptogorgia sarmentosa é tendencialmente afectada por
pressões antropogénicas; Eunicella gazella e Leptogorgia lusitanica
aparentam ser afectadas, quer por pressões naturais, quer por pressões
antropogénicas. Os efeitos verificados nos padrões da distribuição de
frequências de tamanho, particularmente a tendência para o desvio
destas frequências para tamanhos mais pequenos em áreas sujeitas
a perturbações, poderão ter consequências para a biodiversidade dos
fundos sublitorais rochosos na costa algarvia.





Com efeito, o presente estudo apoia o paradigma geral de que os corais
são habitats que suportam comunidades de elevada biodiversidade e
abundância. Num dos poucos estudos que examinam a relação entre
as gorgónias e as suas comunidades de invertebrados epibentónicos, foi
verificado que as gorgónias (Eunicella gazella e Leptogorgia lusitanica)
sustentam comunidades ricas (11 phyla, 181 taxa) e abundantes (7284
indivíduos). Estas comunidades são dominadas por anfípodes, mas
os poliquetas tiveram um grande contributo para os níveis elevados de
biodiversidade. Verificou-se, igualmente, que o tamanho da colónia
desempenha um papel fundamental na biodiversidade, na medida em
que as colónias de menor tamanho apresentaram um contributo mais
baixo, comparativamente às médias e grandes. Ainda que ambas
as gorgónias partilhem a maioria das espécies amostradas, 11 e 18
taxa foram exclusivos de Eunicella gazella e Leptogorgia lusitanica,
respectivamente (excluindo indivíduos com presenças únicas). No
entanto, a maioria destes taxa eram ou pouco abundantes ou pouco
frequentes. A excepção foi a presença de planárias (Turbellaria) de
coloração branca nas colónias de Eunicella gazella, provavelmente
beneficiando do efeito de camuflagem proporcionado pelos ramos com
a mesma coloração. Com efeito, a complementaridade entre as
comunidades epibentónicas associadas a ambas as gorgónias diminuiu
quando usados os dados de presença/ausência, sugerindo que os padrões
de biodiversidade são mais afectados pelas alterações na abundância
relativa das espécies dominantes do que pela composição faunística.
As comunidades de epifauna bentónica associadas a estas gorgónias
não só apresentaram valores elevados de ?-diversidade, como de ?-
diversidade, resultantes de padrões intrincados de variabilidade na sua
composição e estrutura. Ainda que o conjunto de espécies disponíveis
para colonização seja, na generalidade, o mesmo para ambos os locais,
cada colónia apresenta uma parte deste conjunto. Na sua totalidade,
as colónias de gorgónias poderão funcionar como uma metacomunidade,
mas a estrutura das comunidades associadas a cada colónia (ex. número
total de espécies e abundância) parecem depender dos atributos da
colónia, nomeadamente superfície disponível para colonização (altura,
largura e área), complexidade e heterogeneidade (dimensão fractal e
lacunaridade, respectivamente) e cobertura epibentónica “colonial” (ex.
fauna colonial e algas macroscópicas; CEC). Numa primeira tentativa para
quantificar a relação entre as gorgónias e os invertebrados epibentónicos
a elas associados (em termos de abundância e riqueza específica),
verificou-se que a natureza e a intensidade destas relações dependem da
espécie hospedeira e variam para os grupos taxonómicos principais. No
entanto, independentemente do grupo taxonómico, a riqueza específica
e a abundância estão significativamente correlacionadas com a CEC.
Com efeito, a CEC provavelmente devido a um efeito trófico (aumento da
disponibilidade alimentar directo ou indirecto), combinado com a superfície
disponível para colonização (efeito espécies-área) foram as variáveis mais
relacionadas com os padrões de abundância e riqueza específica.





Por outro lado, ainda que a complexidade estrutural seja frequentemente
indicada como um dos factores responsáveis pela elevada diversidade e
abundância das comunidades bentónicas associadas a corais, a dimensão
fractal e a lacunaridade apenas foram relevantes nas comunidades
associadas a Leptogorgia lusitanica. A validade do paradigma que
defende que a complexidade estrutural promove a biodiversidade poderá
ser, então, dependente da escala a que se realizam os estudos. No
caso das gorgónias, o efeito da complexidade ao nível dos agregados
de gorgónias poderá ser muito mais relevante do que ao nível da colónia
individual, reforçando a importância da sua conservação como um todo,
por forma a preservar a diversidade de espécies hospedeiras, o seu
tamanho e estrutura. Actividades antropogénicas como a pesca, podem,
ainda, ter efeitos negativos ao nível da reprodução de espécies marinhas.
Analogamente ao verificado para os padrões de distribuição espacial
das populações de gorgónias na costa algarvia, a informação relativa
à sua reprodução é igualmente escassa. Os estudos realizados em
populações de Eunicella gazella a 16 m de profundidade, demonstraram
que o desenvolvimento anual das estruturas reprodutivas é altamente
sincronizado entre os sexos. A razão entre sexos na população foi
de 1.09 (F:M), encontrando-se perto da paridade. A espermatogénese
estende-se por 6 a 8 meses, enquanto que a oogénese é mais demorada,
levando mais de um ano para que os oócitos se desenvolvam até estarem
maduros. Antes da libertação dos gâmetas, foi observada uma elevada
fecundidade nas fêmeas (27.30 ± 13.24 oócitos pólipo?1) e nos machos
(49.30 ± 31.14 sacos espermáticos pólipo?1). Estes valores encontram-se
entre os mais elevados reportados à data para zonas temperadas. A
libertação dos gâmetas (não há evidência de desenvolvimento larvar,
nem à superfície da colónia, nem no seu interior) occorre em Setem-
bro/Outubro, após um período de elevada temperatura da água do mar.
As fêmeas emitem oócitos maduros de elevadas dimensões, retendo,
todavia, os oócitos imaturos que se desenvolvem apenas na época
seguinte. Ainda que o efeito da pesca nas populações de gorgónias
da costa do Algarve seja perceptível, às taxas actuais, o mergulho
recreativo não aparenta afectar seriamente estas populações. Contudo,
sendo uma indústria em expansão e conhecendo-se a preferência de
mergulhadores por áreas rochosas naturais ricas em espécies bentónicas,
futuramente poderá vir a afectar estes habitats. A monitorização de
mergulhadores na costa algarvia mostrou que a sua maioria (88.6 %)
apresenta comportamentos que podem impactar o habitat, com uma taxa
média de contactos de 0.340 ± 0.028 contactos min?1. Esta taxa foi mais
elevada em mergulhadores com moderada experiência e na fase inicial
do mergulho (0–10 min). Os contactos com as barbatanas e mãos foram
comuns, resultando, maioritariamente, na resuspensão do sedimento,
mas geralmente apresentando um impacto reduzido. Todavia, a fauna
também foi afectada, quer por danos físicos, quer pela interacção com os
mergulhadores, e num cenário de expansão significativa desta actividade,
os impactos na fauna local poderão aumentar, com consequências para
os ecossistemas de fundos rochosos da costa sul de Portugal. Na sua
globalidade, a informação recolhida nos estudos que contemplam esta
tese, por ser em grande parte totalmente nova para a região, espera-se
que contribua para a gestão da zona costeira do Algarve.

Abstract The ecological role of gorgonians (Octocorallia: Alcyonacea) in marine
rocky bottoms is worldwide recognized, but the knowledge on the ecology
and biology of NE Atlantic temperate species is insufficient, considering
current global, regional and local threats. In the rocky bottoms of
the Algarve several gorgonians were abundant and frequent down to
30 m, namely Eunicella labiata, Eunicella gazella, Eunicella verrucosa,
Leptogorgia lusitanica and Leptogorgia sarmentosa. There is a high
association of several gorgonian species that co-dominate assemblages,
indicating low levels of competition among species. Nevertheless,
gorgonian assemblages differed in structure, depending on local condi-
tions. All species evidenced a similar depth pattern, i.e. abundance
significantly increased with depth below 15 m. At shallower waters (up
to 15 m), the distribution of gorgonians may be constrained by abiotic
factors and competition with algae. Indeed, the spatial patterns of
gorgonian populations along the southern coast of Portugal were driven
by the interaction of both natural and anthropogenic pressures (namely
fishing). Although larger colonies were not restricted to the sites with
lower fishing pressure, gorgonian populations sampled in more intensively
fished areas generally presented skewed distributions towards small sizes.
The effects of natural disturbance events on the structure of gorgonian
populations were evidenced by distinct demographic patterns in nearby
areas under similar anthropogenic pressure. The present studies also
showed that the effect of disturbance on size-frequency distribution of
gorgonian populations is species-dependent: Eunicella labiata does not
seem to be affected; Leptogorgia sarmentosa is likely affected mainly
by anthropogenic pressures; Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica
seem to be affected by both kinds of stress. The effects on size-
frequency distributions patterns, namely the trend to skewed distribution
towards small sizes under disturbance may have consequences for
biodiversity of rocky sublittoral areas of the Algarve coast. Indeed, the
present study supports the general paradigm that corals are habitats of
enhanced abundance and biodiversity. In one of the few studies examining
the relationship between gorgonians and their associated non-colonial
epifaunal assemblages, gorgonians (Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia
lusitanica) were found to support rich (11 phyla, 181 taxa) and abundant
(7284 individuals) assemblages. The present study supports the general
paradigm that corals are habitats of enhanced abundance and biodiversity.





In one of the few studies examining the relationship between gorgonians
and their associated non-colonial epifaunal assemblages, gorgonians
(Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica) were found to support rich
(11 phyla, 181 taxa) and abundant (7284 individuals) assemblages. These
epifaunal assemblages were dominated by amphipods, but polychaetes
had a relevant contribute to diversity. Colony size was found to have a
relevant role on biodiversity patterns, with small size colonies contributing
the least for overall biodiversity. Although both gorgonians shared most
of the species collected, 11 and 18 taxa were exclusively associated
with Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica, respectively (without
considering singletons). Nevertheless, most of these exclusive taxa
were either rare or uncommon. The exception was the presence of
white flatworms Turbellaria in Eunicella gazella colonies probably taking
advantage of crypsis with the white Eunicella gazella branches. Indeed,
complementarity in the epifaunal assemblages associated with the two gor-
gonian hosts decreased when data was analysed after presence/absence
transformation, suggesting that patterns of biodiversity are more affected by
changes in the relative abundance of dominant species rather than in faunal
composition. Gorgonian epifaunal assemblages not only showed high
values of ?-diversity but intricate patterns of variability in their composition
and structure leading to high ?-diversity. Although the total pool of species
available in gorgonian colonies appears to be the same in both sites
analysed, each colony yields a rather small set of this species pool. All
together, the colonies may act as a metacommunity, but the structure of
the assemblage in each colony (e.g. total number of species, dominance)
apparently depends upon host attributes, namely the surface available for
colonization (colony height, width and area), complexity and heterogeneity
(fractal dimension and lacunarity respectively) and “colonial” epibiont cover
(e.g. colonial fauna and macroscopic algae; CEC). In a first attempt to
explicitly quantify the link between gorgonians and the abundance and
species richness of associated non-colonial epifaunal invertebrates, the
nature and intensity of these relationships were found to be not only
host-dependent but varied from one taxonomic group to another. In all
faunal groups associated with the two gorgonian hosts analysed, the
species richness and abundance were strongly correlated with CEC. In
fact, CEC possibly due to a trophic effect (direct or indirect enhancement
of food availability) combined with the surface available for colonization
(species-area effect) were the strongest predictors of species richness and
abundance. On the other hand, although structural complexity is usually
indicated as the main driver for the rich and abundant coral-associated
assemblages, fractal dimension and lacunarity were only relevant for the
assemblages associated with Leptogorgia lusitanica. The validity of the
paradigm that structural complexity enhances biodiversity may be scale-
dependent. In the case of gorgonians, the effect of complexity at the
“garden” level may be much more relevant than at the individual colony
level reinforcing the need for the conservation of gorgonian aggregation
areas as a whole in order to preserve host diversity and size structure.
On the other hand, although structural complexity is usually indicated as

The validity of the paradigm that structural complexity enhances biod-
iversity may be scale-dependent. In the case of gorgonians, the effect
of complexity at the “garden” level may be much more relevant than at
the individual colony level reinforcing the need for the conservation of
gorgonian aggregation areas as a whole in order to preserve host diversity
and size structure. Anthropogenic activities like fishing may also have
a negative impact on reproduction. Likewise the lack of information on
distribution patterns of gorgonian assemblages and their role on local
biodiversity patterns, no information was available for the Algarve coast
concerning reproductive patterns of main gorgonian species. The annual
development of reproductive structures in Eunicella gazella populations
(16 m depth) was highly synchronized between sexes. The sex ratio of the
population was 1.09 (F:M) being close to parity. The spermatogenic cycle
extended for six to eight months, but the oogenic cycle was much longer,
taking more than one year for mature oocytes to develop. Prior to spawning,
high fecundity was observed in females (27.30 ± 13.24 oocytes polyp?1)
and males (49.30 ± 31.14 sperm sacs polyp?1). These values are amongst
the highest values reported to date in temperate gorgonians. Broadcast
spawning of the gametes (no evidence of surface or internal brooding)
occurred in September/October after a period of high sea surface
temperatures during summer. Females release large sized mature
oocytes but retain immature oocytes that develop only in the next season.
Although the effect of fishing on gorgonian assemblages in the Algarve
coast is apparent, at current rates, scuba diving does not seem to
seriously affect gorgonians. However, this is a growing industry and the
preference of scuba divers for natural rocky areas with diverse fauna is
well known, which put these habitats under threat. The monitoring of
scuba divers in the Algarve showed that most of them (88.6 %) have
behaviours that can impact the habitat, presenting a mean contact rate
of 0.340 ± 0.028 contacts min?1 (±SE). This rate was higher in scuba divers
with moderate experience, and in the initial part of the dive (0–10 min).
Contacts with fins and hands were common, mainly resulting in sediment
re-suspension, but generally presenting low impact. However, fauna was
also affected by physical damage and interactions, and under a scenario
of significant expansion of this activity, the impacts on local fauna may
increase with consequences for the sublittoral rocky ecosystems of the
Algarve coast. Overall, the information gathered in this thesis, most of it
completely new for the region, is expected to have a major contribution for
the management of the Algarve coast.

6.1. Set of criteria used to rate the impacts of scuba divers. The three levels of impact
were mainly distinguished by the duration of the contact or behaviour (physical
contact and disturbing fauna) or the extension of the physical damage (percent
area affected). For sediment re-suspension and undetermined effects the both the
duration of the contact and the benthic cover were used. Only one case of fish
feeding consisting of two small fish, therefore rated as low impact. The physical
removal of sessile colonies (gorgonians, sponges, bryozoans were always considered
as presenting high impact as they lead to colony death. The possible biological effects
are based on published information regarding different taxonomic groups. . . . . . . . 188

GORGONIANS OF THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL: BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION

I.1. Gorgonians

Morphology and systematics

Cnidaria are one of the most conspicuous faunal groups in marine ecosystems, with species

occupying a diversity of habitats from the intertidal zone to abyssal plains (Daly et al., 2007). The

class Anthozoa, a monophyletic clade from the phyllum Cnidaria, comprises solitary, clonal or co-

lonial polypoid organisms, with approximately 7500 extant species (Daly et al., 2007). Anemones,

corals, seapens and seafans are just some examples of groups of anthozoans that are commonly

found in marine habitats.

The class Anthozoa is comprised by two main monophyletic groups: the Hexacorallia, all

scleractinian and black corals, tube anemones, and sea anemones (? 4300 species); and the
Octocorallia, soft corals, gorgonians (sea fans, sea whips), sea pens, and blue coral (? 3000 species)
(Daly et al., 2007). According to Bayer (1981), gorgonians are octocorals with a supporting skeletal

axis belonging to the order Alcyonacea (Daly et al., 2007), that presents two morphologically separ-

ated suborders, the Calcaxonia and the Holaxonia. Even though many families and genera require

extensive taxonomic revision (McFadden et al., 2006; Daly et al., 2007), several famillies are widely

distributed and speciose, namely Primnoidae, Isididae, Elisellidae, Plexauridae, Gorgoniidae, and

Acanthogorgiidae (Daly et al., 2007).

Gorgonians are common and conspicuous in reef areas around the world (Etnoyer et al.,

2010). These organisms possess an internal axial organic skeleton (proteinaceous material known

as gorgonin, a tanned collagen or calcite) secreted by the coenenchyme, essentially to provide

efficient filtering of food particles and to withstand strong currents (chapter 14, Ehrlich, 2010). Ad-

ditionally, sclerites (mainly of calcite) compose the internal skeleton supporting and maintaining

the shape of the organism, but are also important for protection, anchorage for the musculature

and mineral storage (Fautin and Mariscal, 1991). Gorgonians are modular organisms, i.e. each

individual (a colony) is formed by multiple units (modules), the polyps, distributed over the

coenenchyme (mesoglea) around the gorgonian axis. Octocoral polyps are mainly composed by

the coelenteron (gastric cavity), which is radially divided by eight mesenteries, the stomodeum

(pharynx), a tube of tissue extending from the mouth to the coelenteron, the oral disk and

pinnatelly branched tentacles that protrude from the oral disk between the mesenteries (Fautin

and Mariscal, 1991). Polyps are interconnected by the existence of numerous stem canals and

solenia in the coenenchyme that are used for food and water transport (Fautin and Mariscal, 1991).

The mesenteries have several functions, namely related to reproduction, digestion and circulation

(Fautin and Mariscal, 1991).

INTRODUCTION

The ecological role of gorgonians

Gorgonians are long lived sessile colonial organisms, often presenting slow growth and low

dynamics (Coma et al., 1998b; Garrabou and Harmelin, 2002; Linares et al., 2007, 2010). Because

of their modular nature and internal skeletons that provide both stability (calcite) and flexibility

(gorgonin) (Ehrlich, 2010) gorgonians can attain large sizes (Fautin and Mariscal, 1991), and persist

for long periods of time in benthic marine habitats. Similarly to hard corals, gorgonians can

be considered as ecosystem engineers as they “directly or indirectly modulate the availability

of resources (other than themselves) to other species” and “modify, maintain and/or create

habitats” (Jones et al., 1994). Their three-dimensional structure in the benthic realm provides

niches that can be used or occupied by other species (physical engineering). What is more,

their presence may also facilitate the colonization of space by other species (Begon et al., 2006).

Erect sessile organisms with complex three-dimensional structures, when sufficiently dense, can

decrease water movements and enhance finer sediments accumulation (Bruno and Kennedy,

2000), creating a gradient of environmental conditions that can be efficiently used by other species

(Cerrano et al., 2009). Within gorgonian gardens, the effects of such role are for example increased

biodiversity and faunal biomass (Linares et al., 2007; Cerrano et al., 2009), which can persist and

be relevant over long temporal scales from decades to centuries (Cerrano et al., 2009).

In marine habitats, several species are associated with gorgonians. Filter-feeders hold to

gorgonian branches while feeding, some species predate on their polyps and others use the gor-

gonian for protection (Krieger and Wing, 2002; Buhl-Mortensen et al., 2010). Fish are commonly

found in the vicinity of gorgonians (Figure I.1) (Wolff et al., 1999; Buhl-Mortensen et al., 2010),

sometimes at very short distances (less than one fish length; Bright, 2007) and the composition

of fish assemblages has been found to be related to the presence of gorgonians (Gratwicke et al.,

2006). Moreover, both adults and juveniles of important commercial species (fish and crustaceans)

have been found to be associated with dense gorgonian gardens (Stone, 2006). Even though fish

normally do not feed on gorgonians due to chemical defence by secondary metabolites (O’Neal

and Pawlik, 2002), the butterflyfish Chaetodon capistratus is known to feed on the polyps of

gorgonians, especially of the larger colonies (Lasker, 1985). Other fish species, such as the goby

Bryaninops amplus, use gorgonians for protection, but this effect is dependent of colony height

and gorgonian architecture and fish size is limited by colony width (Sih and Chouw, 2009).

In the coralligenous assemblages of the Mediterranean Sea, gorgonians are considered import-

ant “engineering” or foundation species (Mistri and Ceccherelli, 1994; Linares et al., 2005; Coma

et al., 2006; Linares et al., 2008a,d; Cupido et al., 2009; Gori et al., 2011b; Huete-Stauffer et al.,

2011). Setting the ecological attributes of a species under theoretical frameworks and concepts

sometimes results in confounding those concepts. Gorgonians are probably better defined as

biogenic or foundational species as they create biogenic habitats. Regardless the term used to

INTRODUCTION

classify these organisms, the scale of the effects of “engineering” or foundation species depends

greatly on their density, spatial distribution and capacity per capita (depending on size for benthic

suspension feeders) (Jones et al., 1997). Therefore, all the factors impacting local and regional

populations of foundation species are likely to affect their associated species (Meadows et al., 2012)

and ultimately their ecological role.

Goods and services associated with gorgonians

Similarly to coral reefs, gorgonian gardens may provide an array of goods and ecological

services that are summarized in Table I.1. Therefore, it is essential to acknowledge the goods and

services provided by those specific habitats in order to shed light on the associated cost of loosing

or restore them in the future (Barbier, 2012).

In recent years the demand for natural bioactive compounds by the pharmaceutical industry

led to many investigations concerning gorgonian compounds, especially because many gorgo-

nians present chemical defence against predators (e.g. Van Alstyne and Paul, 1992; Koh et al.,

2000; O’Neal and Pawlik, 2002; Changyun et al., 2008) and disease agents (e.g. Kim et al., 2000;

Shapo et al., 2007). From 1998 to 2009, a total of 263 scientific articles were published in peer

reviewed journals concerning gorgonians (http://isiwebofknowledge.com). The majority of those

articles (173; 65.8 %) were related to bioactive compounds isolated from these organisms, many

of them new to science. With respect to gorgonian species occurring in the south of Portugal,

bioactive compounds have been extracted from Leptogorgia sarmentosa (Garrido et al., 2000;

Boonananwong et al., 2008) and Eunicella labiata (Roussis et al., 1996). The remaining species

from the Portuguese coast, to the author best knowledge, have not been screened for bioactive

compounds, and therefore remain as potential sources of new chemical products. Some of those

compounds may prove valuable for human health as antitumoral, anti-inflamatory, antimalarial,

antimicrobial and antituberculosis agents (Bhakuni and Rawat, 2005; Ioannou et al., 2008; Berrue

and Kerr, 2009; Rocha et al., 2011). Some diterpenoids and pyridines can also be an ecological

alternative to the banned chemical anti-fouling agents (Qian et al., 2010; Rocha et al., 2011), as

the fouling of human made structures in the sea represents significant costs especially concerning

shipping (Schultz et al., 2011).

In the Algarve, the scuba diving industry has been growing in the past few years (Santos et al.,

2006). Together with large sized fishes and shoals, and commercial shellfish species, gorgonian

gardens are considered the top features of a good diving spot in the region. Even though not

evaluated at present, healthy gorgonian gardens per se may add value to the region, especially

if the scuba divers are aware of the ecological relevance of gorgonians as they already value the

aesthetics and structure provided by seascapes characterized by large colonies and high density

and diversity of gorgonians (Rodrigues, 2008).

INTRODUCTION

Due to their ecological role mentioned above, gorgonians may also provide increased fishing

yield, as some commercial fish species are associated to gorgonian habitats (Wolff et al., 1999),

but also because they may provide the links between fish habitats (Moberg and Folke, 1999)

functioning as “stepping stones”.

I.2. Algarve underwater: threatened natural heritage

The Algarve coast

The Algarve region comprises an area of 4996.8 km with its coastline extending for 320 km

(www.ine.pt). The coast presents a high diversity of features, such as abrupt and jagged coastlines,

extensive sandy beaches, salt marshes, sand dunes and inlets forming lagoons (INAG, 2011). In

general, the western coast of the Algarve (Barlavento) is characterized by rocky formations of

several types (e.g. underwater spurs, boulders, smooth rocky plateaus) and different sediment

dynamics. In the eastern coast (Sotavento), the shallow sublittoral area (down to 30 m depth) is

characterized by low relief sandy areas and rocky bottoms are scarce. From Cabo Santa Maria (near

Faro, central part of the Algarve) to Vila Real de Santo António (bordering Spain), there are only two

large rocky areas, Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril. Apart from these two areas, only small rocky

reefs (less than 200 m in length) can be found scattered over the large sandy areas. The scarcity of

rocky bottoms led to the deployment of large sized artificial reefs off the southern coast from 1990

to 2003 (Santos et al., 2011) for fisheries and conservation purposes. According to Fabi et al. (2011),

the overall artificial reef complex consists of more than 21 500 concrete modules, occupying, in a

discontinuous way, a total area of 43 km.

The climate in the region is temperate with average maximum air temperature ranging from

16.1 ( January) to 29.0 ?C (August) (Instituto de Meteorologia, 2012). Sea breezes prevail for 70 % of
the year in the south coast of Portugal, characterized by low wave action during the day rising

to about 1 m height waves from SW at sunset decreasing to less than 0.5 m during the night,

generally with weak residual waves from the SW during the day (Pires, 1985). Storms from SW

(64 %), especially during winter, are the most energetic wave conditions in the Algarve, with waves

frequently higher than 6 m (Costa et al., 2001). Storms from SE (32 %) can generate waves up to 5 m

with short period and associated to strong winds from SE (Costa et al., 2001). The tidal regime is

semi-diurnal and mesotidal with tides ranging from 1.36–2.70 m during neap tides and from 0.64–

3.82 m during spring tides (Moura et al., 2006). In general, the circulation patterns in the Iberian

Peninsula are dominated by up-welling (summer) and down-welling (winter) events associated

to northerly and southerly winds, coupled to the North Atlantic Oscillation (Sánchez et al., 2007).

The coastal flow along the SW Iberian Peninsula has an alternating nature, featuring sharp current

inversions on time scales of less than 2 days (Relvas et al., 2007), with a dominant alongshore flow

on the inner shelf (Sánchez et al., 2006). Topological features, such as the submarine canyon of

Portimão and the Cape São Vicente provide instability, forming eddies that change the circulation

patterns at the mesoscale (Cherubin et al., 2000).

Benthic communities of Algarve sublittoral rocky areas

The shallow sublittoral coastal rocky habitats of the Algarve (&lt;30 m) have been poorly studied
until recently (Gonçalves et al., 2004, 2007, 2010). The shallow rocky areas of the region can be

divided in two main groups, rocky areas extending from the shore and isolated rocky formations

of variable dimensions. In the Sotavento, only the latter group occurs. In the Algarve the

sublittoral rocky areas have Atlantic and Mediterranean affinities and are subjected to moderate

energy (according to the European Nature Information System – EUNIS criteria). The benthic

habitats present an abundant and diverse flora dominated by red algae covering the rocky surfaces

(Mesophyllum spp., Lithophyllum spp., Lithothamnion spp., and Peyssonelia spp.) forming banks

of coralligenous frameworks, with some erect algae (mostly from genera Halimeda and Flabellia)

(Gonçalves et al., 2004, 2007, 2010). The invertebrate community is diverse with several species of

Gastropoda and a wide array of suspension feeders (gorgonians, sponges, hydrozoans, serpulids

and tunicates) (Gonçalves et al., 2004, 2007, 2010). The fish communities in rocky areas are also

diverse being dominated by Sparidae, Labridae and Gobiidae (Gonçalves et al., 2007, 2010).

Three biotopes have been described (Gonçalves et al., 2007, 2010) regarding the faunal com-

munities of these habitats: coastal and deep infralittoral rock (EUNIS A3.24); and circalittoral rock

(EUNIS A4.27). The coastal infralittoral rock (depth&amp;lt;9 m) is mainly dominated by algae (Halopteris
filicina, Litophyllum incrustans, Corallina elongata, Cystoseira spp., Plocamium cartilagineum,

Dictyota dichotoma and Asparagopsis armata), but also presents invertebrate fauna, such as

the cnidarian Anemonia sulcata, the sponge Phorbas fictius and herbivores like the gastropod

Gibbula cineraria and the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. In the deep infralittoral biotope (9–

21 m depth), algae are less dominant, but Litophyllum incrustans and Dictyota dichotoma are

still characteristic, as well as several suspension feeding species such as the sponges Phorbas

fictitius and Cliona viridis, the bryozoans Turbicellopora spp. and Myriapora truncata and the

gorgonians Eunicella gazella and Eunicella verrucosa. Gastropod species (Bolma rugosa and

Hexaplex trunculus) and the cnidarians Anemonia sulcata, Aiptasia diaphana and Corynactis

viridis are also abundant (Gonçalves et al., 2007, 2010). In the circalittoral rocky areas (21–30 m

depth) the benthic communities are dominated by animals, namely conspicuous invertebrates,

such as the gorgonians Eunicella labiata, Eunicella verrucosa, Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia

sarmentosa, the sponges Phorbas fictius, Axinella polypoides, Cliona viridis and Crella fusigera and

the bryozoan Pentapora foliacea but also smaller organisms, such as the anthozoans Parazoanthus

INTRODUCTION

axinellae and Alcyonium acaule and the bryozoan Myriapora truncata (Gonçalves et al., 2007,

2010).

In the Algarve, the deep infralittoral and especially the circalittoral rocky areas are dominated

by dense gorgonian gardens composed by several species, namely Eunicella labiata, Eunicella

verrucosa, Eunicella gazella, Leptogorgia sarmentosa (Gonçalves et al., 2010) and Leptogorgia

lusitanica.

According to the works by Grasshoff (1972, 1977, 1988, 1992); Carpine and Grasshoff (1975);

Vieira (2008) the gorgonian fauna reported for the Algarve waters to 100 m comprise the following

species:

• Suborder: HO L AXO N I A

Natural and anthropogenic impacts in the Algarve coast

Unfortunately, natural and anthropogenic pressures threaten the health of gorgonian gardens,

jeopardising the benefits deriving from the services and goods that they provide.

GORGONIANS OF THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL: BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION

The human population in the Algarve (residents) is increasing since the 1970s (CCDR Al-

garve, 2011d; Instituto Nacional de Estatística, 2011) and in the period between 2001 and 2009

presented a mean population growth of 1.31 % (Carrilho and Patrício, 2010) attaining in 2009 a

population of ?434 000 and a mean density of 86.9 inhabitants km?2 (INE, 2010). Furthermore,
the Algarve population increases dramatically during summer due to tourism (CCDR Algarve,

2011f). The systematic natural and seasonal increase in population led to the development of

several infrastructures, to higher consumption of energy and water (CCDR Algarve, 2011b,a) and

to increased production of waste (e.g. urban solid residues showed an increasing trend from 1999

to 2006; CCDR Algarve 2011e). The local authorities have been carrying out plans to improve

the coastal zone management, namely the POOC (Planos de Ordenamento da Orla Costeira)

aiming at preventing or reducing impacts. However, most of the invested funds were applied in

the re-qualification of beaches (nourishment of beaches with dredged sediments) and defensive

infrastructures (such as spurs, e.g. Vilamoura) and only a small part was applied in ground-base

and monitoring studies (CCDR Algarve, 2011c).

The Algarve has a long tradition of fishing, a relevant socio-economical activity including

several important fisheries, such as the sardine, crustaceans and tuna (Oliveira das Neves, 2000;

Galvão, 2008; Mata, 2009). However, conservation actions have focused primarily on inland habit-

ats in tune with international laws and directives (Habitats Directive, Birds Directive, Natura 2000).

As a result, in the southern Algarve coast only Ria Formosa, Ria de Alvôr (Protected Areas) and the

Martinhal islets (off Sagres, partially protected) present restrictions to fishing and therefore, the

whole coast is subjected to fishing, even though with varying intensity. Consequently, rocky areas

are intensively exploited by professional and recreational fishermen because they usually present

highly appreciated and valued fish and shellfish species. Angling lines, pots, traps, trammel nets,

gill nets, purse seine are commonly used fishing gear in the Algarve (e.g. Erzini et al., 1997; Santos

et al., 2003a; Erzini et al., 2008; Gonçalves et al., 2008; Veiga et al., 2010). These are often set on

or nearby rocky substrata. Storms, or other random events (e.g. interaction between passive and

active fishing gears) can displace fishing gears on the seafloor where they easily become entangled

in the various features of the rocky bottom, such as large rocks, overhangs and spurs but also

on conspicuous living fauna such as large sponges, gorgonians and bryozoans. “Ghost fishing”

(mortality of marine fauna caused by the accidental entanglement in lost fishing gear) can be a

matter of concern in the Algarve as an estimated total of 1782 gill and trammel nets is lost every

year in the Algarve coast. The local fleet (vessels with&amp;lt;9 m) operating mainly close to the coastline,
up to 3 M and at depths lower than 50 m is responsible for 79 % of these lost gear and nearly a

quarter of the fishing traps are lost during fishing operations (Erzini et al., 2008).

GORGONIANS OF THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL: BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION

The impacts associated with fishing, either direct or indirect, affect the sessile benthic com-

munities, namely gorgonians (e.g. Willison et al., 2000; Eno et al., 2001; Morgan and Ratana, 2003;

Shester and Micheli, 2011). Not surprisingly, gorgonians are commonly collected in the Algarve

by fishermen while retrieving fishing gears (Nobre, 1931; Gonçalves et al., 2008; Vieira, 2008). In

fact, detachments from the substratum (Figure I.2) and injuries are the main causes of gorgonian

mortality (Weinberg, 1978; Coma et al., 2004; Linares et al., 2008d). This can be a severe threat

if generalized within a population or community because the recovery of detached gorgonians

seems to be low (Linares et al., 2008d). On the other hand, because of the long life span of lost

fishing gears materials, “ghost fishing” can also inflict substantial damage to sessile organisms,

namely gorgonians (Morgan and Ratana, 2003). The soft tissues of entangled gorgonians are

subjected to long and continuous abrasion, damaging the animals, exposing them to disease and

forcing the colony to allocate energy for regeneration purposes, normally as a trade-off on growth

or reproduction (Wahle, 1983; Rinkevich, 1996; Henry and Hart, 2005).

Anchoring can also impact rocky bottom’s fauna (Milazzo et al., 2002; Davenport and Dav-

enport, 2006; Lloret and Riera, 2008), while casting and uncasting the anchor. In the former,

the anchor may dwell on the rocky bottom destroying any structure that is found in its track.

Furthermore, if the anchor becomes firmly fixed to the bottom, boat skippers tend to accelerate

the engine to release the anchor, increasing the torque and often breaking the structure holding

the anchor. Scuba diving may also affect gorgonians due to breakage or detachment, abbrasion

of the coenenchyme, reduced reproduction and feeding constraints (Coma et al., 1995; Garrabou

et al., 1998; Luna et al., 2009; Tsounis et al., 2012). The consequences of such damages are similar

to those mentioned for fishing.

The challenge of understanding the processes governing global warming is currently one of

the most demanding scientific issues, due to its impacts on human societies and also on the

environment and the biodiversity (Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno, 2010, and references therein).

Mass mortality events of benthic species have been linked to global warming and are well doc-

umented, both for coral reef ecosystems (e.g. Hughes et al., 2003; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007;

Hughes et al., 2010) and for Mediterranean benthic assemblages (e.g. Linares et al., 2005; Coma

et al., 2009; Garrabou et al., 2009; Previati et al., 2010). Solid evidence linking anomalous high

temperatures in the Mediterranean Sea to abnormal mortality of several benthic species has been

gathered, namely concerning gorgonians (Schiaparelli et al., 2007; Huete-Stauffer et al., 2011). The

increase of temperature affects the metabolism of some gorgonian species; it increases the oxygen

consumption up to a temperature threshold and dramatically reduces polyp activity afterwards

(and also oxygen consumption), leading to necrosis and colour change, thus severely affecting the

biology of these animals (Previati et al., 2010). Such catastrophic events affect primarily the density,

growth and reproduction of gorgonian species (Linares et al., 2008c), leading to severe changes in

species composition and community structure of coralligenous communities (Coma et al., 2006).

INTRODUCTION

I.3. Objectives and the branching and modular nature of the thesis

Aiming at contributing to a better knowledge on the ecology and biology of gorgonian as-

semblages in the southern coast of Portugal, and to contribute to their future conservation, several

studies were designed and undertaken that make part of this thesis. Specifically, the present

thesis aims to: 1) characterize the distribution patterns of gorgonians, their variability in the

region and the possible causes of such variability; 2) estimate the biodiversity that is associated

with gorgonians and investigate the factors determining diversity patterns of attendant epifaunal

assemblages; 3) study the reproductive cycle of a frequent and abundant gorgonian and 4) assess

the impacts of scuba diving in the region. The thesis is organized in four parts, each addressing

one of the main objectives of the thesis.

The first part comprehends two chapters. In chapter 1, the abundance and frequency of the

main gorgonian species in shallow rocky bottoms are analysed over 25 km of coastline from 0 to

30 m to determine the spatial variability at the local scale. In chapter 2 the following questions are

addressed: i) what are the main distribution patterns of gorgonians along the southern coast of

Portugal?; ii) are there differences in structure and composition of the assemblages under different

intensity of disturbance?; iii) can size-frequency distributions of dominant species be used as a

proxy to assess the vulnerability of the assemblages?

Part II focuses the fauna that can be found living on gorgonian colonies from the Algarve.

Chapter 3 aims to investigate if i) different gorgonian species and ii) colonies of different size

present different epifaunal assemblages (composition and structure) and if those patterns are

consistent in space and time. In chapter 4, the effects of colony area, structural complexity,

epibiont cover on the diversity and abundance of the attendant fauna of Leptogorgia lusitanica and

Eunicella gazella are investigated. In this chapter, it is also investigated how different taxonomic

or functional groups, with different habitat requirements, respond to gorgonian attributes.

The study on the reproductive biology of Eunicella gazella presented in chapter 5, the first for

this species, aims to characterize the oogenic and spermatogenic cycles of this common species in

the Algarve, and estimate its fecundity and spawning period.

Chapter 6 aims to characterize the impacts of scuba diving in the Algarve, investigating also

if scuba diver experience and the time of dive influence the rate of contacts and the associated

impacts to the habitat and fauna.

Finally, and because the information provided by the several studies is of different nature, the

main results are integrated into general conclusions. It is also discussed how the results and

conclusions can be used for management purposes and pointed out some future research.

Abstract

The ecological role of gorgonians for marine rocky bottoms is worldwide recognized, but

the information on the distribution patterns of NE Atlantic temperate species is insufficient,

considering current global, regional and local threats. To overcome the lack of information on

the spatial distribution patterns of gorgonians in south Portugal, in 2009/2010 the occurrence

and abundance of gorgonian species in rocky bottoms were quantified over more than 25 km of

coast (37.1°N/8.6°W ) down to 30 m depth. Eunicella labiata, Eunicella gazella, Eunicella verrucosa

and Leptogorgia sarmentosa were abundant and frequent in the studied area, while Leptogorgia

lusitanica was less abundant. All species evidenced a similar depth pattern, i.e. abundance

significantly increased with depth below 15 m. At shallower waters (up to 15 m), the distribution

of gorgonians may be constrained by abiotic factors and competition with algae. Indeed, the

abundance of gorgonians was negatively correlated with the percentage cover of algae along the

depth gradient, but competition between gorgonians and sponges was not apparent. Competition

among gorgonian species also seems to be low in this area because of the similarity in the

abundance pattern observed for the most abundant species and also their high association. In NE

Atlantic shallow temperate rocky bottoms, the distribution of gorgonians seems to be influenced

by environmental factors and biological interactions, namely competition with algae.

1.1. Introduction

Gorgonians (Octocorallia: Alcyonacea) are colonial organisms characterized by a hard skeleton,

slow growth and long life span. Their three dimensional structure may modify the physical

habitat, by reducing current velocity, stabilising soft substrata, enhancing sedimentation and local

accumulation of fine particles (Bruno and Kennedy, 2000), as well as increasing availability of

niches. Because gorgonians are long-lived animals they may extend these modifications for long

time, producing significant effects in marine ecosystems, namely by enhancing local diversity

(Cerrano et al., 2009). These animals are considered as ecosystem engineers (sensu Jones

et al., 1994, 1997), whose ecological role in ecosystem functioning has been widely acknowledged

(Ballesteros, 2006; Coma et al., 2006; Cupido et al., 2008; Linares et al., 2008d), with particular

emphasis on their role in marine conservation (see Wright and Jones, 2006).

Over the last decades, many studies reported that gorgonians are affected by drastic, rapid

28



CHAPTER 1. SPATIAL AND DEPTH-ASSOCIATED DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF GORGONIANS IN TEMPERATE NE
ATLANTIC SHALLOW ROCKY BOTTOMS

and lasting disturbances either of natural (Martin et al., 2002; Linares et al., 2005; Coma et al.,

2006; Schiaparelli et al., 2007; Garrabou et al., 2009) or human origin, such as fishing (mainly

bottom trammel/gill nets, bottom seine and bottom trawl) (Bavestrello et al., 1997; Willison et al.,

2000; Chiappone et al., 2002, 2005), pollution (Bruno et al., 2003; Cerrano and Bavestrello, 2008),

anchoring and scuba diving (Coma et al., 2004; Linares et al., 2008d). Detailed knowledge on

the distribution patterns of abundance of each species is essential to detect the human footprint

in marine ecosystems and propose adequate and achievable conservation and management

measures (Benedetti-Cecchi et al., 2003; García-Charton et al., 2008; Costello et al., 2010).

The Algarve coast (southern Portugal, north-eastern Atlantic) presents a rich fauna with biogeo-

graphic affinities with the Mediterranean Sea, the Lusitanian, the west African Transition, Northern

European Seas and Western Atlantic provinces (sensu Spalding et al., 2007; Souto et al., 2010; Levy

et al., 2011), because of the proximity to the Strait of Gibraltar (Baus et al., 2005, and references

therein) and the confluence of oceanic currents (Cherubin et al., 2000; Pérez et al., 2001; Coelho

et al., 2002; Martins et al., 2002). However, the gorgonian populations of southern Portugal are

poorly described, especially compared to the Mediterranean, where in the past few years, several

studies have been performed in shallow sublittoral waters, gathering a large amount of biological

and ecological information, and building predictive models to be used in conservation plans

(Linares et al., 2007, 2008d; Bramanti et al., 2009). In fact, the most recent study concerning the

gorgonian fauna of the Algarve coast reported only 10 different species caught as by-catch by

bottom gill nets (Vieira, 2008). Therefore, significant knowledge gaps still persist, namely on the

abundance patterns in the near shore benthic community (0–30 m), spatial and depth distribution.

In this context, the present study aimed to quantify the occurrence and abundance of the

main gorgonian species in the shallow rocky bottoms (0 to 30 m) of the western Algarve coast

(?25 km of coastline). In order to assess the relationship between the distribution of gorgonians
and potential competitors for space and food, the percentage cover of erect algae and Porifera

were also quantified. If population dynamics of those benthic taxa is governed by competition, it

is expected that the abundance of gorgonians and both erect algae and Porifera would be inversely

correlated.

1.2. Materials and Methods

1.2.1. Study area

The Algarve coast (Figure 1.1) is characterized by heterogeneous coastline and sublittoral

areas. The western part of the Algarve coast comprises rocky formations of several types (e.g.

29



PART I. GORGONIAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE ALGARVE COAST

Figure 1.1.: Location of the sampling sites (•) in Lagos Bay.

underwater spurs, boulders, low relief rocky areas, submerged rock bottoms) and by different

sediment dynamics.

The study area is located in the western Algarve coast extending from Lagos to Portimão

(Figure 1.1), hereafter designated by Lagos Bay. This area has 20.6 km2 of rocky bottoms within

a total area of 70 km2 (up to 30 m depth) and covers ?25 km of the Algarve coast, distancing only
?30 km to the westernmost continental part of Europe (Cabo São Vicente, Sagres). In particular,
the coast between Ponta da Piedade and Armação de Pêra, where this study was conducted, is

morphologically complex presenting rocky areas with cliffs forming small beaches, a large bay with

extensive sandy beaches and dunes, including a coastal lagoon (Ria de Alvor) and a small estuary

(Rio Arade). The shallow continental shelf (down to ?30 m depth) is generally characterized by
rocky outcrops with pockets of rubble and/or sand (Gonçalves et al., 2010).

In general, the circulation patterns in the Iberian Peninsula are dominated by up-welling

(summer) and down-welling (winter) events associated to northerly/southerly winds, coupled to

the North Atlantic Oscillation (Sánchez et al., 2007). Sea surface temperature presents marked

seasonal variation depending on whether down-welling or up-welling dominates (ranging from

14 to 24?C, respectively; http://www.hidrografico.pt/), whereas salinity is fairly constant (35.0–
36.0).

ATLANTIC SHALLOW ROCKY BOTTOMS

1.2.2. Species identification

Identification of gorgonian species was based on the studies by Carpine and Grasshoff (1975),

Grasshoff (1988, 1992) and González (1993). In the Algarve coast, underwater identification of

gorgonians is difficult because of ambiguities in the taxonomy of Eunicella and Leptogorgia, and

therefore the following criteria were established to identify these species:

Eunicella gazella – colonies always white with orange polyps; diameter of the ramets noticeably

larger than in Eunicella verrucosa; colony surface generally homogeneous with low relief and

extensive branching mostly in one dimension.

Eunicella verrucosa – colonies with colour varying from white to cream, beige or pale orange;

polyps varying from white to orange; heterogeneous surface with “bumps” (verrucae), usually

larger in size than Eunicella gazella.

Eunicella labiata – large species; colonies divided in two main branches immediately after the

base of the colony, with less branches than Eunicella verrucosa and Eunicella gazella; colours are

usually darker than in the previous species, ranging from cream to dark brown; colonies are often

broken, loosing one of the main branches; conspicuous verrucae observed all over the colony,

usually lighter.

Eunicella singularis – erect colonies with few long branches always in upright position; colonies

always white coloured; colony surface generally smooth with low relief.

Leptogorgia lusitanica – bush-like colonies growing in only one dimension, perpendicular to

dominant currents; terminal branches thinner than the central ones; extremely variable in colour,

generally presenting two colours, usually wine red/purple and yellow, sometimes white and blue,

and other times uniform in colour (generally white or yellow); the central branches of the colony

usually lack polyps in the surface facing the currents.

Leptogorgia sarmentosa – bush-like colonies growing in one or more dimensions; usually of

uniform but variable colour (green, yellow, red, brick orange, rarely white); polyps usually present

in all surfaces of the branches.

1.2.3. Spatial and depth distribution of the main gorgonian species

In order to describe the patterns of spatial and vertical distribution of gorgonian species, a total

of 69 sites were sampled by means of underwater transects by scuba diving (5 × 1 m belt transects,
3 replicates at each site) from May 2009 to June 2010. Sampling sites were randomly selected,

31



PART I. GORGONIAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE ALGARVE COAST

but restricted to rocky substrata, explaining the spatial gaps. In this area, gorgonians are rarely

found in soft bottoms, therefore sampling effort was directed towards rocky bottoms only. The

bathymetric distribution of the gorgonian species was analysed considering the average depth of

each sampling unit and estimating the median density at 6 depth levels: 0–5 m, 5–10 m, 10–15 m,

15–20 m, 20–25 m and 25–30 m.

1.2.4. Competition between gorgonians and other benthic groups

In order to assess competition effects between gorgonians and potential competitors for space

and food, the abundance of erect algae (macroalgae and turf ) and Porifera was quantified. While

conducting the censuses of the gorgonian populations, the number of sponges was counted at

each transect and the percentage cover of erect algae was quantified using quadrats (1 × 1 m, 3
replicates).

1.2.5. Statistical analyses

The distribution of gorgonian species indicated that only five out of seven species were frequent

in the study area (see Results). Therefore, the comparison of the density of gorgonians at

different depth levels was undertaken for the overall gorgonian assemblage (all gorgonians) and

for the most frequent species (Leptogorgia sarmentosa, Leptogorgia lusitanica, Eunicella gazella,

Eunicella labiata and Eunicella verrucosa) using parametric (one-way ANOVA) or non-parametric

methods (Kruskal-Wallis’ U test) whenever ANOVA assumptions were not met. In both cases,

pairwise multiple comparisons were used: Tukey Honestly Significant Differences (Tukey HSD)

and Behrens-Fisher non-parametric multiple test (Berhens-Fisher) (Munzel and Hothorn, 2001),

respectively. The number of transects was not constant at each depth level, resulting in an

unbalanced design, therefore depth levels with fewer samples (0–5 m and 25–30 m) were discarded

to improve the power of the statistical tests. The correlation between depth and density of

gorgonians was tested by means of an exponential regression using the loge (1 + y ) transformation
of the dependent variable.

Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to analyse differences in the distribution and

abundance patterns of gorgonian assemblages using the modified Gower dissimilarity index with

transformed data (log2(x + 1)). The modified Gower index (Anderson et al., 2006) is able to detect
changes in composition, with the advantage of being directly interpretable as the average change

in orders of magnitude (defined by the transformation). By using log2 transformation the modified

Gower index is weighted towards a compositional change equal to a doubling in abundance

(Anderson et al., 2006). To analyse the contribution of each species to the discrimination of the

32



CHAPTER 1. SPATIAL AND DEPTH-ASSOCIATED DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF GORGONIANS IN TEMPERATE NE
ATLANTIC SHALLOW ROCKY BOTTOMS

compared assemblages, the indicator value (IndVal) was used (Dufrêne and Legendre, 1997). On

the other hand, the ecological association of gorgonians was quantified using three measures

based on binary data (presence-absence data): Ochiai, Dice and Jaccard (Janson and Vegelius,

1981). The three measures present minimum coexistence values of 0 when the two species are

never found together and maximum coexistence values of 1 when both species always occur

together (Janson and Vegelius, 1981).

The correlation between the abundance of gorgonians and potential competitors was assessed

using linear regression. All statistical analyses were performed using the open source software R

version 12.1 (R Development Core Team, 2010).

1.3. Results

1.3.1. Distribution patterns of gorgonian species

Occupancy and abundance

In Lagos Bay, gorgonians were present in 134 (64.7 %) of the 207 sampling units, totalling 2481

colonies belonging to seven taxa (Table 1.1). Four species, Eunicella labiata, Eunicella verrucosa,

Leptogorgia sarmentosa and Eunicella gazella, were responsible for 96.9 % of the total abundance.

Eunicella labiata was the most frequent and abundant species with 905 colonies, occurring in

52.7 % of the transects and representing 36.5 % of the total gorgonians found. Eunicella verrucosa

was the second most frequent and abundant species with 22.4 % of the total abundance and

occurring in 45.9 % of the transects. Leptogorgia sarmentosa was present in 39.6 % of the transects

with 485 colonies (19.5 %). Eunicella gazella was found in 40.1 % of the transects contributing for

18.5 % of the total abundance. Leptogorgia lusitanica was found in 16.9 % of the transects and

totalling 72 colonies (2.9 %). Only three colonies of Eunicella singularis were found in a single

transect. One Eunicella colony (Eunicella sp.) could not be identified to species level.

Spatial and depth distribution

Generally, gorgonians were present in the entire study area, without any evidence of spatial

segregation (Figure 1.2).

In Lagos Bay, gorgonians were found from 7.5 to 27 m (the maximum depth sampled). The

depth range of all species presented similar upper limits, with Leptogorgia sarmentosa occurring

from 7.5 m, Eunicella verrucosa from 8.0 m, Eunicella labiata and Leptogorgia lusitanica from 8.7 m

and Eunicella gazella from 11.6 m. The increase of gorgonians’ abundance with depth was evident

and common to the most frequent and abundant species (Figure 1.3). Up to 15 m, gorgonians

were rare or presented very low abundance. At depths deeper than 15 m all species increased in

abundance and showed similar trends. At 20–25 m, more than 5 colonies m?2 were found in Lagos

Bay. All species showed large variation in abundance at 15–20 m and 20–25 m, especially the most

abundant and frequent ones (Figure 1.3).

Significant differences were found in the abundance of all species at different depth levels

(Table 1.2). For the most abundant and frequent species, Eunicella labiata, significant differences

were found between depth levels below and above 15 m (Table 1.2). The second most abund-

ant species, Eunicella verrucosa, showed significant differences between 10–15 m and 20–25 m,

whereas Leptogorgia sarmentosa showed differences between 20–25 m (its highest abundance)

and the shallower depth levels (up to 15 m). Eunicella gazella was absent above 10 m and rare

at 10–15 m, increasing significantly its abundance with depth. Leptogorgia lusitanica exhibited

low abundance but still the same increasing pattern with depth. Its abundance was significantly

higher at depths below 15 m, even though apparently decreasing at 25–30 m.

An exponential trend was detected between depth and gorgonian’s abundance for the ba-

thymetric range of this study (Figure 1.4). All regressions were highly significant (p&lt;0.001) and

presented high coefficients of determination (r 2 = 0.438–0.787, except for Leptogorgia lusitanica

with 0.221). The increase of 1 m in depth is associated with a 10.3–11.0 % increase in the number

of colonies of Leptogorgia sarmentosa, Eunicella gazella and Eunicella verrucosa, with Eunicella

labiata showing the highest percentage (15.5 %) and Leptogorgia lusitanica presenting a much

lower value (3.0 %). The rates of increase in the two latter species were significantly different from

the remaining (Leptogorgia lusitanica, ANCOVA, p&lt;0.001; Eunicella labiata, ANCOVA, p&lt;0.05).

The non-metric multidimensional scaling diagram (Figure 1.5) shows a depth gradient from

left to right, reflecting differences in abundance within each depth level. The composition and

structure of the gorgonian assemblages in Lagos Bay presented significant differences (Permanova,

Pseudo F = 4.07, p &amp;lt;0.001), due to higher abundances at deeper sites. However, the generally
low indicator values (IndVal 0.31–0.44; p &gt; 0.05) showed that the composition of the assemblages
was similar at all depth levels and most species (except Eunicella singularis) occurred in several

depth levels. The assemblage was characterized by a dynamic alternation in species rankings

with Eunicella labiata being in the top two ranks along the studied depth range and Leptogorgia

sarmentosa alternating from first to fourth in rank. The low abundance of Leptogorgia lusitanica

was reflected in its rank position, fifth at all depth levels.

Four species were highly associated, coexisting in a large number of the samples. Eunicella

labiata, Eunicella verrucosa, Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia sarmentosa presented high values

of the three indices used (Ochiai, 0.68–0.85; Dice, 0.68–0.84; Jaccard, 0.51–0.74, all indices range

from 0–1), whereas Leptogorgia lusitanica showed lower values (Ochiai, 0.46–0.58; Dice, 0.38–0.50;

Jaccard, 0.24–0.33) and Eunicella singularis presented extremely low levels of association with the

remaining gorgonian species (0–0.19).

1.3.2. Relationship between gorgonians and potential competitors

The distribution of erect algae (mainly Chlorophyta and Phaeophyta) and Porifera in Lagos Bay

is also depth-dependent. The abundance of erect algae (dominated by Dictyota dichotoma, Aspar-

agopsis armata, Halopteris filicina, Gelidium latifolium and Peyssonnelia rubra) declined along

the depth gradient. In the other hand, the Porifera clearly increased their abundance with depth

(Figure 1.6). This group was dominated by encrusting forms such as Phorbas fictitius, Scopalina

lophyropoda, Cliona viridis, Axinella damicornis and Chondrosia reniformis and massive erect

forms such as Crella elegans and Axinella polypoides. A significant negative correlation (Linear

regression, r 2 = 0.439, F1,11 = 8.605, p &amp;lt;0.05) between the percentage cover of erect algae and
the number of gorgonian colonies was found in Lagos Bay, whereas a positive correlation (Linear

regression, r 2 = 0.769, F1,11 = 36.67, p &amp;lt;0.05) was detected between sponges and gorgonians
(Figure 1.6).

1.4. Discussion

According to Weinberg (1978), the two main factors affecting the octocorallia communities are

irradiance and presence of sediment in the substrate. The amount of light reaching an underwater

surface is related to depth, even though it depends on several factors, namely transparency and

suspended particles (Gili et al., 1989). Depth, slope and the interaction of these two factors have

been reported as presenting a marked positive effect in Anthozoa species distribution (Gili et al.,

1989). Indeed, many studies highlighted major variations of physical (e.g. currents, sedimentation)

and chemical variables (organic matter content) along the depth gradient, with consequences for

the distribution of marine communities (e.g. Garrabou et al., 2002; McArthur et al., 2010).

The present study detected a clear depth pattern in the distribution of all gorgonian species in

Lagos Bay, suggesting that the ecology of these suspension feeders is strongly affected by environ-

mental factors that may change with depth and their interactions, such as currents, sedimentation

and organic matter. For most species, the general pattern found indicated increasing abundances

with depth within the analysed depth range. The present study also revealed that the 15 m

bathymetric seems to be an important turning point in the distribution of most gorgonian species

in Lagos Bay, which can be related to higher irradiance above this depth but also to higher surf

impact. Indeed, in the Algarve, the lower beach profile limit (closure depth), where wave action is

able to disturb the sea bottom, is around 10 m below mean sea level (Dolbeth et al., 2007; Almeida

et al., 2011), which is known to influence the patterns of benthic communities (Dolbeth et al.,

2007; Carvalho et al., in press). The upper depth distribution limit of the dominant gorgonians in

Lagos Bay was very similar suggesting that they are determined by abiotic conditions as observed

elsewhere (Zabala and Ballesteros, 1989; Linares et al., 2008a), especially the high water motion

of shallower coastal areas. The combination of both factors (strong irradiance and surf ) was

already reported as being determinant in the distribution of western Mediterranean gorgonian

species (Weinberg, 1978). Depth distribution in tropical shallow water gorgonians is also mainly

governed by light (Sánchez et al., 1998) and other environmental factors affecting light (e.g. bed

load, Yoshioka and Yoshioka, 1989), mainly because most species are zooxanthellate (Dahlgren,

1989; Sánchez et al., 1998). In opposition, shallow water gorgonian assemblages in the Algarve are

dominated by azooxanthelate octocorals, and the zooxanthelate gorgonian Eunicella singularis is

rarely sampled (and the presence of zooxanthelae in the few colonies found in the Algarve was not

confirmed). Besides, in the present study, erect algae dominated the biocenoses at low depth but

rapidly decreased their abundance when light intensity is reduced, with their abundance being

inversely correlated to the abundance of gorgonians. In shallow water, algal-dominated benthic

communities present species that favour out-competition processes being continuously replaced

(Garrabou et al., 2002). In contrast, animal-dominating deeper communities tend to present slow

growth species avoiding competition displacement and enhancing the maintenance of diversity

and complexity (Garrabou et al., 2002). However, there is a depth range (12–20 m) where the abiotic

conditions seem suitable both for erect algae and gorgonians where competition for space occurs,

explaining the negative correlation between the two groups. In fact, anthozoans are unable to

compete with large algae where light intensity is high (Gili et al., 1989; Zabala and Ballesteros, 1989)

supporting the idea that the bathymetric behaviour of gorgonian species in Lagos Bay may be only

indirectly linked to light intensity. Therefore, ecological processes, such as competition, rather

than physical processes alone may influence the depth distribution of gorgonians in shallower

waters. In the Mediterranean, a similar model has been proposed, consisting of three zones:

a superficial zone (0–10 m) dominated by erect algae, a mixed zone (10–15 m) co-dominated

by erect algae, crustose algae and suspension feeders and a third zone (15–42 m) dominated

by suspension feeders (Zabala and Ballesteros, 1989). But in Lagos Bay, competition for space

and food was not apparent between gorgonians and sponges. Both groups presented similar

distribution patterns with depth and were positively correlated indicating that, if competition is

occurring, it is kept at low levels. The habitat requirements of the species that compose these two

suspension feeding groups are probably different with small overlap. Massive erect sponges such

as Crella elegans and Axinella polypoides may compete for space with gorgonians, but these are

only a part of the Porifera assemblage (percentage cover of sponges was not assessed) dominated

by encrusting forms that use the available space below erect forms efficiently. Regarding food

42



CHAPTER 1. SPATIAL AND DEPTH-ASSOCIATED DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF GORGONIANS IN TEMPERATE NE
ATLANTIC SHALLOW ROCKY BOTTOMS

sources, sponges mainly feed on very small particles, such as suspended particles, free-living

bacteria and colloidal organic matter, being extremely efficient at capturing particles down to

0.1 µm (Ruppert and Barnes, 1994; Riisgård and Larsen, 2010). On the other hand, gorgonians

mainly feed on larger particles such as zooplankton and particulate organic carbon, with some

species, such as Leptogorgia sarmentosa presenting a wide spectrum of food sources being able

to feed on particles as small as 4 µm (Ribes et al., 2003). Considering that, of the species found

in Lagos Bay, those with smaller polyps are the Leptogorgia, it is not expectable that the feeding

habits of the remaining species considerably overlap with particles that can be filtered by sponges,

thus allowing us to suggest that competition for food must be relatively low in Lagos Bay and

passive (gorgonians) and active (sponges) suspension feeders can co-exist (Gili and Coma, 1998).

Concerning competition between gorgonian species, the similarity in depth distribution patterns,

and the high association of the most abundant species suggests that these slow-growth species are

not competing among themselves. The lower coexistence of Leptogorgia lusitanica with the more

abundant species may be due to its lower abundance in Lagos Bay being absent in a high number

of samples. In fact, the only case of competition between gorgonians reported for nearby areas

concerns the mutual exclusion of Eunicella cavolinii and Eunicella verrucosa in Mediterranean

coralligenous habitats (Carpine and Grasshoff, 1975). However, until now, Eunicella cavolinii has

not been found in the Algarve, and there is no evidence that Eunicella verrucosa distribution is

being constrained by competition. It is important to notice that the strong associations found

between the gorgonian species that are more representative of Lagos Bay should be addressed

with care as competition may take place at lower scales (&lt;5 m). At deeper depths, where abiotic

factors are more homogeneous, benthic communities are sometimes dominated by suspension

feeders and patchy in nature (Zabala and Ballesteros, 1989; Garrabou et al., 2002), with some

gorgonian species showing a patchy distribution pattern (Linares et al., 2005). In this context,

scale is determinant for niche dynamics in space (Pearman et al., 2007) and the used scale may

encompass different niches used contrastingly by species, with insufficient resolution to ascertain

differences between gorgonian species.

Concerning the gorgonian assemblage composition, four species are well represented in the

area, with Eunicella labiata being the most abundant and Eunicella verrucosa, Eunicella gazella

and Leptogorgia sarmentosa presenting similar abundance. Of these dominant gorgonians, the

Eunicella species are poorly represented in the Mediterranean, where shallow water gorgonian

assemblages are dominated by Paramuricea clavata, Eunicella singularis and Leptogorgia sar-

mentosa (e.g. Ballesteros, 2006; Gori et al., 2011a). However, the abundance of each dominant

species in the Mediterranean is clearly associated to habitat characteristics such as vertical fa-

cies, soft bottoms, maerl, pebbles and rocks (Gori et al., 2011a), suggesting different ecological

requirements. On the contrary, in Lagos Bay, the distributions of the dominant gorgonian species

were all well correlated (species occurring at the same sites) suggesting that the rocky areas are

relatively homogeneous with respect to available niches for several gorgonian species. However,

43



PART I. GORGONIAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE ALGARVE COAST

because the study was restricted to rocky areas, the environmental gradients in several topographic

and environmental factors that can affect the distribution of gorgonians are relatively short,

minimizing the influence of those factors in the distribution of some species.

The most frequent and abundant species found, Eunicella labiata, is relatively common in

coralligenous habitats near the Strait of Gibraltar (González, 1993), but to the authors’ best

knowledge, this species has only been reported recently for the Algarve coast (Gonçalves et al.,

2007; Vieira, 2008), probably resulting from erroneous identifications in the past. Another recent

study also reported its occurrence in the Professor Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (Arrábida, Center

Portugal) (Rodrigues, 2008), where it was frequent but not dominant. Another abundant Eunicella

species in Lagos Bay, Eunicella verrucosa has been described as an Atlantic species with a wide

vertical range. In the current study, this species was found from 8 to 27 m, which agrees with

data from the Strait of Gibraltar, where it occurs from 6 to 87 m (González, 1993). However, in the

Mediterranean this species is only found at deeper waters (35 to 200 m) because of the competition

with Eunicella cavolinii, which occurs mainly between 10 and 30 m (Carpine and Grasshoff, 1975).

The wider bathymetric range observed both in Lagos Bay and the Strait of Gibraltar may be due

to the lack of competitive exclusion by Eunicella cavolinii, which was not observed in both areas

but is common in the Mediterranean. The other species dominating the assemblages in Lagos

Bay, Eunicella gazella, presented a distribution positively correlated to that of Eunicella verrucosa,

which once more is in agreement with the findings by González (1993) in the Strait of Gibraltar,

where they are also commonly found together.

The dominance of Leptogorgia sarmentosa in the study area may be related to the presence of

sediment particles in the rocky bottom. Indeed, this species is clearly associated with areas with

frequent but moderate disturbance, where sediment re-suspension is high (Gori et al., 2011a), and

has been pointed as an indicator of silt (Weinberg, 1978, reported as Leptogorgia ceratophita).

Although it has been reported to inhabit different substrates, namely rocky areas, shells on

biodetritic sediments and sandy muddy areas (González, 1993), it shows a high correlation with

soft bottoms or surfaces where sediments tend to accumulate (Gori et al., 2011a). The preferential

distribution of Leptogorgia sarmentosa within areas of high sedimentation rates may be related to

its feeding requirements, as it is known that re-suspended particles are particularly important for

this species’ diet (Ribes et al., 2003; Rossi et al., 2004). According to our observations, sediment

transport (bed load) is high in the Lagos Bay area, probably because this area is near the Rio Arade

estuary, Ria de Alvor (coastal lagoon) and Ribeira de Bensafrim (creek). The habitat conditions in

Lagos Bay clearly favour this species as the area is mainly characterized by low relief rocky plateaus

with a thick layer of fine sediments that are easily re-suspended (submerged rock bottoms). In the

Mediterranean, this species is abundant in sheltered areas with turbulent circulation but without

strong near-bottom currents (Gori et al., 2011a). Regarding Leptogorgia lusitanica, even though its

ecological requirements are still poorly understood, it has been described as preferring habitats

44



CHAPTER 1. SPATIAL AND DEPTH-ASSOCIATED DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF GORGONIANS IN TEMPERATE NE
ATLANTIC SHALLOW ROCKY BOTTOMS

with weak to moderate hydrodynamics but clear waters (González, 1993). In fact, in other areas

of the Algarve coast where sedimentation and turbidity is lower, this species presents higher

abundance at similar depths (e.g. Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril, authors’ unpublished data).

The low abundance and frequency of occurrence of Eunicella singularis was already expected,

as it is a Mediterranean species with limited distribution outside this area. This species is one of the

dominant taxa in the coralligenous communities in the Mediterranean Sea (Ballesteros, 2006; Gori

et al., 2011a) and can be found on horizontal or slightly sloped surfaces in light-rich areas, having

a marked dependence on light. Indeed, this is the only gorgonian species in the Mediterranean

area presenting zooxanthellae, but has been reported from 6–67 m. The preferential habitat

described for this species is frequent in the study area, but the species was rarely found in Lagos

Bay. We hypothesize that the colonies found in the study area are colonizers from Mediterranean

populations that under favourable conditions were able to reach and settle in suitable rocky areas

of the Algarve coast.

Final remarks

The present study provides invaluable information on the spatial and depth distribution of

gorgonian species in shallow rocky bottoms near the westernmost part of continental Europe.

The key role of gorgonians in the infralittoral rocky communities poses another challenge, the

capacity of these animals to cope with both thermal stress but also pathogens under a climate

change scenario, an important issue for the future management of coastal marine ecosystems. The

present data is also relevant for the establishment and management of future MPAs in southern

Portugal, a common management tool in several areas of the world, namely in the Mediterranean,

where gorgonians are used as ecological indicators. What is more, “coral gardens”, including

gorgonian dominated biocenoses in south Portugal and Spain have been recently proposed for

the OSPAR (Convention for the Protection of the marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic)

list of protected habitats (Anonymous, 2011). Therefore, reference data like the one provided by

this study may be relevant for future monitoring programmes. In Lagos Bay, the abundance of

all gorgonian species increases with depth, showing a strong association to another suspension

feeding benthic taxa, the Porifera. The specific ecological requirements regarding space and food

of the two taxonomical groups probably present low overlap, thus competition levels shall be

low. However, at shallower depths, gorgonians seem to be out-competed by algae for space, even

though the upper limit in the distribution of gorgonians in Lagos Bay is probably mostly related

to abiotic factors such as high water movement. Further multidisciplinary studies, with broader

spatial and temporal scales but also wider depth ranges, supported by modern technology (e.g.

ROVs and remote sensors) should be undertaken in order to elucidate on the abiotic and biotic

factors that might be affecting the distribution of these octocorals in the Algarve coast.

PART I. GORGONIAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE ALGARVE COAST

Abstract

The gorgonian fauna of the southern Portuguese coast is composed by species of different

origins: NE Atlantic (Eunicella verrucosa, Leptogorgia lusitanica), Mediterranean (Leptogorgia sar-

mentosa, Eunicella singularis, Paramuricea clavata) and North Africa (Eunicella labiata, Eunicella

gazella), highlighting the importance of this geographical area for the fluxes of biological diversity.

While the western Mediterranean assemblages are mainly monospecific, in the south coast of

Portugal, there is a high association of several gorgonian species that co-dominate assemblages

even though differing in structure. The analyses of size-frequency distributions and abundance

suggest that the spatial patterns of gorgonian distribution along the southern coast of Portugal are

driven by the interaction of both natural and anthropogenic pressures. Although larger colonies

were not restricted to the sites with lower fishing pressure, gorgonian populations sampled in more

intensively fished areas generally presented skewed distributions towards small sizes, and more

peaked than normal distributions. The effects of natural disturbance events on the structure of

gorgonian populations were evidenced by distinct demographic patterns in nearby areas under

similar anthropogenic pressure. The existence of a thick sediment layer over the hard bottoms in

the disturbed area suggests that sedimentation may have caused a high mortality in small sized

gorgonians and prevented the settlement and/or recruitment, resulting in a bimodal distribution.

This study also provides evidence that the response of gorgonians to disturbance is species-

dependent: Eunicella labiata does not seem to be affected; Leptogorgia sarmentosa seems to be

affected mainly by anthropogenic pressures; Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica seem to

be affected by both kinds of stress.

2.1. Introduction

Gorgonians are colonial organisms with a relevant role in the marine ecosystem namely by sta-

bilising soft-substrata, enhancing sedimentation and promoting the increase of local biodiversity

(Bruno and Kennedy, 2000; Cerrano et al., 2009). Nevertheless, over the last decades, several

studies reported that gorgonians are severely affected either by anthropogenic pressure, such as

fishing (Bavestrello et al., 1997; Willison et al., 2000; Chiappone et al., 2002, 2005), anchoring, scuba

diving (Coma et al., 2004; Linares et al., 2008d; Di Franco et al., 2009) and pollution (Bruno et al.,

2003; Cerrano and Bavestrello, 2008), or natural disturbances (Martin et al., 2002; Linares et al.,

2005; Coma et al., 2006; Burkepile and Hay, 2007; Schiaparelli et al., 2007; Garrabou et al., 2009;

54



CHAPTER 2. INDIRECT EVIDENCE OF HUMAN PRESSURE ON THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND SIZE STRUCTURE
OF GORGONIAN POPULATIONS IN THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL

García-Matucheski and Muniain, 2010; Huete-Stauffer et al., 2011). Anthropogenic pressures are

known to cause partial or total mortality of the gorgonian colonies, reduction in competitive ability,

higher risk of disease, and lower growth rates, fertility and reproductive capacity (e.g. Weinberg,

1978; Coma et al., 2004; Linares et al., 2008c). Besides, the effects of human activities are known to

be size-dependent (Shin et al., 2005; Jennings and Reynolds, 2007). Body size of a species is crucial

for its ecology, life history, population dynamics, and exploitation vulnerability, since it is related

to life history traits such as somatic growth rate, fecundity and age at maturity (Reynolds et al.,

2001), namely in scleractinian corals (Meesters et al., 2001) and octocorals (Yoshioka, 1994; Coma

et al., 1995; Tsounis et al., 2006; Linares et al., 2007). Consequently, size-frequency distributions of

marine species have been used for environmental impact assessment (Shin et al., 2005).

In the past few years, management plans focusing on the whole ecosystem have been advocated

[Ecosystem Based Management (McLeod et al., 2005) and Ecosystem Approaches to Management

(Murawski, 2007)], and the need for data on ecosystem structure, namely at the population level

has been emphasized (e.g. Levin and Lubchenco, 2008; Ellis et al., 2011). Particularly in the

Mediterranean, several studies have been undertaken in order to gather a large set of biological

and ecological information regarding gorgonian fauna (Linares et al., 2007, 2008d; Bramanti et al.,

2009). Indeed, information on spatial distribution patterns, growth, reproduction and dispersion

is crucial to build up predictive models to be used in conservation plans (Benedetti-Cecchi et al.,

2003; García-Charton et al., 2008; Costello et al., 2010). In contrast, information concerning spatial

distribution and ecological requirements of shallow water gorgonians in the NE Atlantic is scarce,

namely in the south coast of Portugal. Because of its geographic location, this area harbours a rich

marine fauna with biogeographic affinities to the Temperate Northern Atlantic (Mediterranean

Sea, Lusitanian and Northern European Seas provinces) and Tropical Atlantic (the west African

Transition, and Northwestern/Southwestern Atlantic provinces) (sensu Spalding et al., 2007; Souto

et al., 2010; Levy et al., 2011), because of the proximity to the Strait of Gibraltar (Baus et al.,

2005, and references therein) and the confluence of different oceanic currents (Cherubin et al.,

2000; Pérez et al., 2001; Coelho et al., 2002; Martins et al., 2002). As such, it is expected that this

area presents particular features in what concerns the composition and structure of gorgonian

fauna. Besides, information on such a particular geographic area can also be crucial for a better

knowledge on the patterns and processes underlying the overall distribution of gorgonians in

Atlantic and Mediterranean waters.

To overcome the lack of information on the occurrence and abundance distribution patterns of

gorgonian species of shallow rocky habitats, several transects were established along the southern

coast of Portugal. Because previous studies showed that gorgonian populations may be affected

by anthropogenic activities, sampling comprised areas under different levels of human pressure.

Therefore, the present study aims at contributing for an insight knowledge on shallow water

gorgonians in the NE Atlantic rocky habitats and to assess potential effects of anthropogenic

55

activities on such populations. Specifically, the following questions will be addressed: i) what are

the main distribution patterns of gorgonians along the southern coast of Portugal?; ii) are there

differences in structure and composition of the assemblages under different intensity of human

pressure?; iii) can size-frequency distributions of dominant species be used as a proxy to assess

the vulnerability of the assemblages?

2.2. Materials and Methods

2.2.1. Study area

This study was conducted in the south coast of Portugal (Algarve), characterized by het-

erogeneous coastline and sublittoral areas. In general, the circulation patterns in the Iberian

Peninsula are dominated by seasonal upwelling (spring-summer) and downwelling (winter) events

associated to northerly and southerly winds, coupled to the North Atlantic Oscillation (Sánchez

et al., 2007). The coastal flow along the SW Iberian Peninsula has an alternating nature, featuring

sharp current inversions on time scales of less than two days (Relvas et al., 2007), with a dominant

alongshore flow on the inner shelf of the northern margin of the Gulf of Cádiz (Sánchez et al.,

2006). Topographic features such as the submarine canyon of Portimão and the Cape São Vicente

interact with the Mediterranean Outflow Water forming eddies that characterize the circulation

patterns at the mesoscale (Cherubin et al., 2000). Salinity is fairly constant 35.0–36.0 but sea

surface temperature presents a marked seasonal variation between 14 and 24 ?C depending on
whether upwelling or downwelling dominates.

The western part of the Algarve coast (Barlavento) is generally characterized by rocky form-

ations of several types (e.g. underwater spurs, boulders, low relief rocky areas, submerged rock

bottoms), by different sediment dynamics, and also different human activities over the entire area.

The coastal area near Lagos (see Figure 2.1), in particular, is morphologically complex, presenting

rocky areas with cliffs forming small beaches, a large bay with extensive sandy beaches and dunes,

a coastal lagoon (Ria de Alvor) and the Arade and Bensafrim estuaries. The shallow continental

shelf (down to ?30 m depth) is generally characterized by rocky outcrops with pockets of rubble
and/or sand. In the eastern part of the Algarve coast (Sotavento), rocky bottoms are scarce and

only two large areas are found, Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril (Figure 2.1). Apart from these

two areas, only small rocky reefs can be found scattered over the large, low relief sandy areas.

Three rocky areas in the Algarve were surveyed. The Lagos Bay is located in the western part

of the Algarve that extends from Lagos to Portimão and comprises an area with 20.6 km2 of rocky

bottoms and covers ?25 km of the Algarve coast with depth ranging from 0 to 30 m. Pedra da Greta

is a rocky outcrop running parallel to the shoreline at 15–18 m depth with ?2 km length, 50–100 m
width and 1–3.5 m height. Pedra do Barril is also a rocky outcrop running parallel to the shoreline

at 22–27 m depth with ?3 km length, 100–150 m width and 2–5 m height. Because the depth range
of rocky habitats at Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril do not overlap and are more restricted than

the rocky habitats at Lagos Bay, in the latter location sampling was stratified by dividing the area

into comparable depth ranges (Lagos shallow, 15–20 m; Lagos deep, 20–25 m) to enable proper

comparisons.

Some environmental features of the sampled areas are summarized in Table 2.1. Semi-

quantitative criteria were set for different environmental parameters (complexity, sediment cov-

ering the rocky surfaces, intensity and frequency of underwater currents, re-suspension of sed-

iments) to characterize the different study locations. The sediment type surrounding each area

was obtained using sediment classification cartography (Anonymous, 2006a) and the percentage

of fine particles (&lt;63 µm) in their vicinity was estimated for a circular area of 4 km diameter using
GIS. Generally, Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril present higher relief and topographic complexity

than Lagos Bay (Table 2.1). The shallower sites, Lagos shallow and Pedra da Greta, are surrounded

mainly by medium to coarse sandy sediments whereas Lagos deep and Pedra do Barril neighbour

sediment areas characterized by fine particles (&lt;63 µm). Therefore, re-suspension of sediment
particles is more likely to occur at the deeper areas resulting in higher proportions of the substrate

covered by sediments and lower visibility. In Pedra do Barril, moderate underwater currents re-

suspending sediment were frequently observed during sampling.

2.2.2. Human impacts potentially affecting gorgonians in South Portugal

In south Portugal, contamination is largely due to coastal development and industry that

57



PART I. GORGONIAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE ALGARVE COAST

operates in the area, being concentrated in urban areas and influenced by freshwater inputs

(Machado et al., 1999; Wayland et al., 2008). Scuba diving has been growing in the past few years

and, generally, the western part of the Algarve (Barlavento) presents higher number of divers, dives

and diving companies than the eastern part (Sotavento) (IPIMAR unpublished data). However,

the number of visits per site is similar at both areas because there are more rocky areas and

consequently more diving spots in Barlavento. Moreover, the number of diving companies, divers

and dives (IPIMAR unpublished data) are low when compared to those of other areas with intensive

scuba diving (e.g. Red Sea, Mediterranean Sea) and the estimates of damage inflicted to gorgonians

by scuba divers is low (unpublished data). On the other hand, large storm events are rare, not

long-lasting, and of similar intensity across the overall coastal area, and mass mortality events,

reported elsewhere (Martin et al., 2002; Linares et al., 2005; Coma et al., 2006; Schiaparelli et al.,

2007; Garrabou et al., 2009), have never been reported for the Algarve. Nevertheless, in years of

long summer periods of high temperature and calm sea (such as the summers of 2006, 2009, 2010

and 2011, http://www.hidrografico.pt/boias-ondografo.php), there was some evidence of mats

covering uniformly the sea bottom rapidly disappearing when water temperature drops and sea

roughness increases ( JC, personal observation). Therefore, because of the low intensity of the

previous potential damaging factors to gorgonians in south Portugal, the most plausible impacts

affecting these assemblages seem to be fishing and anchoring that are known to cause complete

or partial mortality by physical contact (Bavestrello et al., 1997; Eno et al., 2001; Johnson, 2002;

Milazzo et al., 2002). As no spatial data on the distribution of anchoring is available, and there are

no major reasons to suspect that anchoring is higher in any of the areas, we accept the hypothesis

that this pressure is similar along the coast.

Fishing gears such as seize nets, trammel nets, gillnets, longlines and traps are intensively used

by fishermen in the area, being frequently lost along the Algarve coast (Erzini et al., 1997; Santos

et al., 2003a,b; Erzini et al., 2008). Due to the scale and importance of commercial fishing in the

Algarve, this activity arises as the most important and frequent source of damage for gorgonians,

even though very difficult to quantify. It is, however, known that in the Algarve, gorgonians are

commonly caught accidentally by fishermen while retrieving fishing gears (Nobre, 1931; Gonçalves

et al., 2008; Vieira, 2008).

Some statistics concerning fishing are summarized in Table 2.2, comparing the western (Bar-

lavento; Lagos Bay) and eastern (Sotavento; Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril) parts of the coast.

The local fleet (vessels with less than 9 m) and the coastal fleet (vessels with more than 9 m) are

allowed to fish in the studied areas in shallow waters (Erzini et al., 1997; Santos et al., 2003a; Erzini

et al., 2008). Generally, the number of fishing licenses, number of fishing vessels and captures are

higher in Sotavento than in Barlavento suggesting a higher fishing effort in the former area. What

is more, the area of rocky bottoms in the Sotavento is much lower than in Barlavento, contributing

to the concentration of fishing, thus increasing fishing pressure.

CHAPTER 2. INDIRECT EVIDENCE OF HUMAN PRESSURE ON THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND SIZE STRUCTURE
OF GORGONIAN POPULATIONS IN THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL

The information on lost fishing gears by the local fleet operating in shallow waters at both

areas reinforces this idea (Table 2.2). Another indicator that fishing pressure in nearshore waters

is higher in Sotavento is the number of octopus traps used per vessel by the local fleet and the

higher proportions of lost traps for both fleets. Based on this information and also on surface

(e.g. number of buoys and fishing vessels) and underwater observations by the authors during the

sampling surveys (e.g. lost fishing gears), fishing pressure is higher in Pedra da Greta and Pedra do

Barril (Sotavento) than in Lagos Bay (Barlavento) (Table 2.2).

2.2.3. Distribution of gorgonians at the regional scale of the Algarve

The distribution of gorgonians was quantified by means of underwater transects by scuba

diving (5 × 1 m belt transects). Specifically, 72 transects were conducted at Lagos shallow and 30
transects at Lagos deep. A total of 20 transects were conducted in Pedra da Greta and 12 in Pedra

do Barril. Identification of gorgonian species was based on the studies by Carpine and Grasshoff

(1975), Grasshoff (1988, 1992) and González (1993). In the Algarve coast, underwater identification

of gorgonians is difficult because of ambiguities in the taxonomy of Eunicella and Leptogorgia, and

therefore we used a set of criteria defined by Cúrdia et al. sub.b.

Multivariate methods were used to analyse the gorgonian communities at the studied areas.

Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to inbestigate differences in the distribution and

abundance patterns of gorgonians across locations using the modified Gower dissimilarity index

with transformed data (log2 x + 1). The modified Gower index (Anderson et al., 2006) is able to
detect changes in composition but has the advantage of being directly interpretable as the average

change in orders of magnitude (defined by the transformation). By using log2 transformation

the modified Gower index is weighted towards a compositional change equal to a doubling

in abundance (Anderson et al., 2006). Community composition differences between groups

of samples were assessed using the non parametric multiple response permutation procedure

(MRPP) (Zimmerman et al., 1985; Foster et al., 2009). Indicator species analysis (ISA) was per-

formed to investigate the association of each gorgonian species to the studied areas, with the

indicator species value (Dufrêne and Legendre, 1997) estimated using the index
?

I nd V al
g
i nd

(hereafter designated IndVal) proposed by De Cáceres et al. (2010). Differences in abundance

between groups of samples were tested using the non parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. To

quantify the ecological association of gorgonian species, three measures based on presence-

absence data were used: Ochiai, Dice and Jaccard (Janson and Vegelius, 1981). The three measures

range from 0 (when the two species being compared do not share any sample) to 1 (when the

two species share all the samples). All statistical analyses were conducted using the open source

software R version 12.1 (R Development Core Team, 2010).

2.2.4. Size-frequency distribution patterns

The size-frequency distribution patterns were analysed at the four sampling areas for Eunicella

gazella, Eunicella labiata, Leptogorgia lusitanica and Leptogorgia sarmentosa. These species were

selected because of their frequency of occurrence and abundance, as well as their relevance in

differentiating gorgonian assemblages (see Results). For each species, all the colonies observed

along linear transects were measured in order to prevent duplicates. The scuba diver dived close

to the substratum in order not to miss the smallest colonies. The maximum height of each colony

was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm and used as size parameter (Linares et al., 2008d).

The mean height of each species in each site both at shallow and deep sites was compared

using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Size- frequency distribution of each gorgonian

population was analysed using histograms and kernel density estimation (e.g. Everitt and Hothorn,

2006; Turley and Ford, 2011). The size-frequency distribution curve was analysed in terms of

descriptive statistics using skewness and kurtosis (Linares et al., 2008d). Skewness (g1) is a measure

of the symmetry of a distribution, being defined as the third moment of the distribution divided by

its standard deviation (Legendre and Legendre, 1998). If skewness is significant, the distribution

is asymmetric. Positive skewness corresponds to a frequency distribution with a longer “tail” to

the right than to the left (prevalence of small size classes in the population), whereas a distribution

with a longer “tail” to the left than to the right shows negative skewness (dominance of large size

classes) (Legendre and Legendre, 1998). Kurtosis (g2) is a measure of the peakedness (or flatness)

of a distribution near its central model, being defined as the fourth moment of the frequency

distribution. A significant value of kurtosis indicates that the variable has longer tails than those

for a normal distribution and therefore the prevalence of a particular size class in the population.

Skewness and kurtosis coefficients are significant if g1 per SES (standard error of skewness) or g2

per SEK (standard error of kurtosis) is greater than 2 (Sokal and Rohlf, 1995). All statistical analyses

were conducted using the open source software R version 12.1 (R Development Core Team, 2010).

2.3. Results

Gorgonians were very frequent in the study area being observed in more than 95 % of the

transects sampled at each area. Eight gorgonian species were identified in the present study but

Paramuricea clavata, Eunicella singularis and Eunicella sp. were rare and presented extremely low

abundance (Table 2.3).

Gorgonian assemblages were mainly composed of: three Eunicella species, Eunicella labiata,

Eunicella gazella and Eunicella verrucosa; and two Leptogorgia species, Leptogorgia lusitanica

and Leptogorgia sarmentosa. The density of gorgonians was extremely variable but the above

mentioned species commonly presented dense aggregations of conspecifics. Besides, these

species were highly associated in the study area as they were commonly observed at the same

transects Figure 2.2. Within each assemblage, the dominant species presented high similarity

between themselves, whereas the less abundant and frequent species presented lower values.

This pattern was particularly evident in Lagos Bay at both depths, where Leptogorgia lusitanica

presented low abundance (2.4 % and 2.8 % of the total, for shallow and deep sites, respectively)

and was less frequent (present in 22 % and 30 % of the sampled transects, respectively). The same

pattern was found for Leptogorgia sarmentosa in Pedra da Greta and for Eunicella verrucosa in

The non metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) ordination plot showed three main clusters:

one large cluster aggregating the samples from Lagos Bay and two smaller clusters comprising

the samples of Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril (Figure 2.3). The superimposition of total

abundance and number of species data evidenced a gradient from the lower left corner to the

upper right corner of the plot (Figure 2.3, Abundance and Number of Species). The indicator

species analysis (ISA) indicated that Eunicella labiata was common and abundant at all sampled

areas (IndVal=0.959) but that Paramuricea clavata was exclusive of Pedra do Barril (IndVal=0.500,

p = 0.003). Leptogorgia sarmentosa was mainly associated with deeper sites (Lagos deep and Pedra

do Barril, IndVal=0.816, p = 0.001), whereas two species were more characteristic of the Sotavento
(Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril), namely Leptogorgia lusitanica (IndVal=0.963, p = 0.001) and
Eunicella gazella (IndVal=0.907, p = 0.001). Eunicella verrucosa was common at Lagos shallow,
Lagos deep and Pedra da Greta (IndVal=0.853, p = 0.001). The ISA results were also reinforced by
the patterns evidenced when the abundance data of each gorgonian species was superimposed to

the nMDS ordination plot (Figure 2.3).

The multiple response permutation procedures (MRPP) detected differences in the structure

of the assemblages for several sources of variation (Table 2.4). It is noteworthy that multivariate

dispersion was different between the samples of the Barlavento and the samples of Sotavento

(Table 2.4), thus the differences observed with MRPP may be due to differences in dispersion

and not to differences in the structure of the community. The assemblage structure was different

between Barlavento and Sotavento, namely because of the significantly higher density of Eunicella

gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica in Sotavento (Tables 2.3 and 2.4 and Figure 2.3). Depth

also influenced the structure of gorgonian assemblages, as Eunicella labiata and Leptogorgia

sarmentosa were more frequent and presented higher density at deeper sites. In Barlavento, the

occurrence and density of Eunicella verrucosa was also higher at deeper sites (Tables 2.3 and 2.4).

On the other hand, in Sotavento the latter species presented lower density at deeper sites and

was observed only in 25 % of the transects. What is more, Eunicella gazella also presented higher

density at deeper sites in Sotavento. Comparing the samples at similar depth ranges at lower depth,

Eunicella labiata and Leptogorgia sarmentosa presented lower density in the Sotavento (Pedra

da Greta), with the latter species also showing lower occurrence rates (Table 2.3). In addition to

the previously mentioned general pattern between Barlavento and Sotavento, the differences in

gorgonian assemblages between Lagos deep and Pedra do Barril were due to Eunicella labiata,

which was more abundant in Pedra do Barril, and Eunicella verrucosa, which was rare in this area.

2.3.2. Size-frequency distributions

The sample size varied between sites depending greatly on the density of each species at each

site. The height of Eunicella gazella, Leptogorgia lusitanica and Leptogorgia sarmentosa at 15–20 m

(shallow sites) was significantly lower in Pedra da Greta, where fishing is more intensive (Table 2.5)

but the opposite trend was observed concerning Eunicella labiata presenting taller colonies in this

location. Concerning the deeper populations, the pattern was different: Eunicella labiata did not

present significant differences between populations, whereas the populations of the remaining

species from the less fished area (Lagos deep) presented a significantly lower height than in Pedra

do Barril.

The distributions of Eunicella gazella sizes were positively skewed with the exception of Lagos

shallow which is symmetric. However, only the population of Pedra do Barril presented a distri-

bution that is more peaked than a normal distribution (see Figure 2.4 and Table 2.5). The other

Eunicella species presented symmetric distributions at all sampled sites but the distributions in

the populations of the less fished areas (Lagos Bay) were less peaked than a normal distribution,

as they showed significant negative kurtosis. Similarly to Eunicella gazella, the distribution of

sizes of Leptogorgia lusitanica, except for the population of Lagos shallow, were asymmetric,

presenting significant positive skewness values (deviated towards small sizes). This species

presented negative kurtosis for the population of Lagos shallow, and positive kurtosis for the

remaining populations; yet only the population from Pedra da Greta presented significant kurtosis

(more peaked than a normal distribution; Figure 2.4 and Table 2.5). The populations of Leptogorgia

sarmentosa were symmetric in the less fished areas and asymmetric in the fished areas, where

positively skewed distributions were oberved (towards small sizes). However, only the population

from Pedra da Greta presented a significant kurtosis, showing a more peaked distribution (due to

the high number of small sized colonies&amp;lt;10 cm).

Size-frequency distributions for Leptogorgia lusitanica, Leptogorgia sarmentosa, Eunicella ga-

zella and Eunicella labiata populations at Lagos shallow, Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril were

generally unimodal, and more or less bell-shaped (Figure 2.4). However, the four gorgonian species

seem to present a bimodal distribution at Lagos deep with a large contribution of small sizes for

all species (&lt;5 cm for Eunicella gazella;&amp;lt;10 cm for Eunicella labiata, Leptogorgia lusitanica and
Leptogorgia sarmentosa). At this site, Eunicella labiata is the only species whose population is not

clearly dominated by small sizes, presenting a peak at ?40 cm (the major peak of the distribution).

Figure 2.4.: Relative frequency of maximum colony height of Eunicella gazella, Eunicella labiata, Leptogor-

Greta) and deep sites (Lagos deep and Pedra do Barril). Kernel density estimation curves are
also presented (area below the curve integrates to unity). Dashed vertical lines represent each
population’s mean height.

2.4. Discussion

The gorgonian fauna of the southern Portuguese coast is composed by species of different

origins, namely from the Atlantic (Eunicella verrucosa), Mediterranean (Leptogorgia sarmentosa,

Eunicella singularis, Paramuricea clavata) and North Africa (Eunicella labiata, Eunicella gazella),

highlighting the importance of this geographical area for the fluxes of biological diversity, namely

those of long lived animals with a relevant role in the benthic ecosystem functioning. The inexist-

ence of previous quantitative studies in the study area hampers comparisons and consequently

the assessment of potential changes in abundance and structure of gorgonian fauna. Some

remarkable differences, however, emerged from the comparison with the Mediterranean area.

While the western Mediterranean assemblages are mainly monospecific (Bianchi, 2007; Gori et al.,

2011a), in the Algarve, diversity is higher, similarly to the observed in tropical areas (Lasker and

70



CHAPTER 2. INDIRECT EVIDENCE OF HUMAN PRESSURE ON THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND SIZE STRUCTURE
OF GORGONIAN POPULATIONS IN THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL

Coffroth, 1983; Yoshioka and Yoshioka, 1989; Chiappone et al., 2003). Besides, in the Mediter-

ranean area, species rarely coexist (Gori et al., 2011a), whereas in the south coast of Portugal,

there is a high association of several gorgonian species that co-dominate the assemblages. The five

dominant species, Eunicella gazella, Eunicella labiata, Eunicella verrucosa, Leptogorgia lusitanica

and Leptogorgia sarmentosa were also found to be abundant and to co-occur in several locations in

the Alborán Sea, near the entrance of the Mediterranean (Ocaña et al., 2000). Contrastingly, in the

neighbouring western Mediterranean waters, gorgonian assemblages are generally dominated by

Paramuricea clavata or Eunicella singularis with Eunicella cavolinii and Leptogorgia sarmentosa

also being common and abundant (e.g. Coma et al., 2004, 2006; Linares et al., 2008a; Garrabou

et al., 2009; Gori et al., 2011a). Except for Leptogorgia sarmentosa, the remaining species are

entirely absent or rare and presenting low abundance in the Algarve, showing once more a

remarkable resemblance to the patterns observed near Gibraltar and the Alborán Sea (González,

1993; Ocaña et al., 2000). The present results reinforce the importance of areas under the influence

of different water masses and oceanographic curents for marine biodiversity and conservation

(Bianchi, 2007; Carvalho et al., in press).

2.4.1. Observed distribution and ecology of gorgonians

Despite the co-existence of the main species, some spatial differences in the abundance

patterns were observed along the southern coast of Portugal that may be related to different en-

vironmental requirements of the species but also to a higher fishing pressure in the Sotavento. For

example, Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica were more abundant in fished areas, while

the abundance of Eunicella labiata and Leptogorgia sarmentosa was greater in less fished areas.

The abundance of gorgonians increased with depth, in line with reports of other geographical

areas (e.g. Stone, 2006; Linares et al., 2008a; Gori et al., 2011a), but also for the south of Portugal

(Cúrdia et al., sub.b). Physical complexity of the substrate is very different at the sampled areas,

increasing from Lagos Bay to Pedra da Greta. At Pedra do Barril, intermediate complexity levels

were observed, as canyons cutting the rocky formations were less common and less heterogeneous

than in Pedra da Greta, but rocky formations generally presented higher elevation from the seabed

(3–5 m). Contrastingly, turbidity showed the opposite trend being higher at Lagos Bay, probably

because of the proximity of the mouth of the Arade and Bensafrim estuaries and the Ria de Alvor

coastal lagoon. These observations support the distribution pattern of Leptogorgia sarmentosa,

which abundance was significantly higher in Lagos Bay than in the other studied areas. This

species has been pointed out as indicator of silt (Weinberg, 1978) and characteristic of horizontal or

sloped surfaces where sediment tend to accumulate or even of soft-bottoms (González, 1993; Gori

et al., 2011a); it is also typical of areas of moderate disturbance where sediment re-suspension

is high (Ribes et al., 2003; Rossi et al., 2004; Gori et al., 2011a). The habitat conditions in Lagos

Bay clearly favour this species as the area is characterized by low relief rocky plateaus with a thick

71



PART I. GORGONIAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE ALGARVE COAST

layer of fine sediment particles that are easily re-suspended (submerged rock bottoms). On the

other hand, the few Leptogorgia sarmentosa observed in Pedra da Greta were found in horizontal

surfaces of rock with low relief and close to sandy areas (in the reef margins and in sand pockets)

or in isolated rocks between large blocks. The intermediate abundance values found at Pedra do

Barril together with the intermediate values of sediment bed load reinforce the influence of this

environmental parameter as a driving force in structuring Leptogorgia sarmentosa assemblages,

which is supported by the importance of re-suspended particles in the diet of this species (Ribes

et al., 2003; Rossi et al., 2004). Even though the environmental conditions at Lagos Bay seemed

to be highly favourable for Leptogorgia sarmentosa assemblages, its mean abundance at 20–

25 m depth (1.94 colonies m?2) was similar to the maximum density values reported by Gori et al.

(2011a, 1.5 colonies m?2), but much lower than the 17 colonies m?2 found by Weinberg (1978) and

Mistri (1995) in other western Mediterranean areas. However, the maintenance of population at

intermediate abundance levels may be a strategy of the species to overcome potential abrasion

effects caused by water movement, as Leptogorgia sarmentosa is characterised by thin and flexible

branches, and therefore, dense populations are more likely affected by abrasion (Tsounis et al.,

2006).

Ecological requirement of the remaining species are still poorly acknowledged. However, it is

known that, for example, Leptogorgia lusitanica prefers habitats with some hydrodynamics but

clear waters (González, 1993), which is consistent to the present dataset. In opposition to the

observed for Leptogorgia sarmentosa, higher densities of Leptogorgia lusitanica were observed

in Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril when compared to Lagos Bay, where turbidity was higher.

On the other hand, sedimentation and turbidity do not seem to affect the establishment and

succession of Eunicella species, particularly Eunicella labiata, which seems to have the ability

to tolerate different levels of sedimentation, generally presenting high abundance and/or being

a top ranked species in areas subjected to different levels of sedimentation. Eunicella verrucosa,

although distributed along the southern Portuguese coast, was more common and abundant in

Lagos Bay and Pedra da Greta than in Pedra do Barril. This distribution pattern may reflect its

habitat requisites, as this species has been described as relatively sciaphilic, living in hard bottom

habitats (Carpine and Grasshoff, 1975), sloped rocky blocks and on small rocks and shells in detritic

bottoms (González, 1993), which were rare in the sites sampled in Pedra do Barril. What is more,

this species and Leptogorgia sarmentosa have been commonly found in shallow waters in western

Mediterranean in areas with increased turbidity (Sartoretto and Francour, 2012).

The low abundance and frequency of occurrence of Eunicella singularis and Paramuricea

clavata was expected as these are typical Mediterranean species. Paramuricea clavata was only

accounted in Pedra do Barril, especially in vertical walls, but with low abundance (although

not observed in this study, this species has been also occasionally observed in Pedra da Greta

and in Lagos Bay). These observations are consistent with reports from the Mediterranean,

72



CHAPTER 2. INDIRECT EVIDENCE OF HUMAN PRESSURE ON THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND SIZE STRUCTURE
OF GORGONIAN POPULATIONS IN THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL

where Paramuricea clavata is extremely abundant in vertical walls at similar depths (Linares

et al., 2008a; Gori et al., 2011a), reaching densities of 52.5 colonies m2 (Linares et al., 2008d).

Paramuricea clavata presents a narrow range of environmental requirements, such as irradiance

and sedimentation (Linares et al., 2008a). The latter factor has been suggested as determinant

for the variation of its upper limit depth along the Mediterranean Spanish coast, being reported

from southern sites at similar depth to Pedra do Barril, around 25–30 m depth (Linares et al.,

2008a). In Portuguese waters, this species has been observed outside the study area, in Professor

Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (Arrábida, Center of the western Portuguese coast) (Rodrigues, 2008),

Ilha das Berlengas (Center/North of the western Portuguese coast) (Rodrigues et al., 2008) where

it is found in large densities in vertical walls ( J G, personal observation) and in the submarine

mountains of the Gorringe Bank (Anonymous, 2006b). Recently, it has been reported that in

southern Portugal, Paramuricea clavata dominates the gorgonian assemblage at 59–120 m depth

(Anonymous, 2011). Taking into consideration that the present study accounted for shallow waters

only, the distribution of Paramuricea clavata in the Algarve may be underestimated, highlighting

the need for further studies at deeper depths. In the case of Eunicella singularis, which is very

abundant in the Mediterranean (Ballesteros, 2006; Gori et al., 2011a), displaying great plasticity

and amplitude in its environmental preferences (Gori et al., 2011a), its low occurrence and

abundance may be related to the generally lower light intensity of the Algarve mesotrophic waters

when compared to the oligotrophic Mediterranean waters. Shallow colonies of Eunicella singularis

host zooxanthelae and consequently have a marked dependence on light (Previati et al., 2010; Gori

et al., 2011b).

2.4.2. Impacts on shallow water gorgonians: anthropogenic versus natural
disturbance

In the study area, fishing and anchoring seem to be the most potentially injurious anthropo-

genic disturbance events affecting gorgonian assemblages. Besides, based on several statistics,

fishing pressure is higher in the Sotavento than in Barlavento. In situ observations during surveys

support this idea, as in areas under higher fishing pressure, gorgonian colonies detached from the

bottom and covered with sediment were frequently observed. Contrary to some gorgonians that

reattach and recover after disturbance events, the recovery of detached gorgonians in the Algarve

seems to be low, similarly to what has been reported from the Mediterranean (Linares et al., 2008d).

Differences in gorgonian density over the studied areas may be a consequence of the interaction

of both natural and anthropogenic pressures, which is supported by the size-frequency distribu-

tion of the main gorgonian species. Gorgonian populations sampled in more intensively fished

areas generally presented skewed distributions towards small sizes, and more peaked than normal

distributions suggesting that these populations are affected by disturbance events. However,

73



PART I. GORGONIAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE ALGARVE COAST

in the studied populations, gorgonians of higher sizes were not restricted to the sites under

lower pressure, as observed for other soft corals where larger sizes are found in more pristine

sites (Linares et al., 2008a, and references therein). The survival of large-sized colonies play an

important role in the persistence of gorgonian populations, compensating for poor reproductive

success (Yoshioka, 1998) and, therefore, this item should always integrate management plans.

On the other hand, the present data showed that all gorgonian populations in Lagos deep

presented bimodal distributions, suggesting a disturbance event that eradicated part of the popu-

lations and/or severely affected recruitment over time. This site was characterized by a thick layer

(1–3 cm) of fluidised sediment, which totally covered many small sized gorgonian colonies that

presented retracted polyps. Considering the location and the environmental characteristics of the

site, the most probable disturbance was high loads of sediments distributed over the seabed, most

coming from the Arade river, that are easily re-suspended (see Airoldi, 2003, for a review). Data

on recruitment, natural mortality and growth rates for the Algarve are completely unavailable,

therefore it is impossible to ascertain if the disturbance was punctual or repeated in time. These

observations lead us to hypothesize that disturbance event(s) resulting in a large accumulation

of sediments in shallow rocky bottoms may affect gorgonian populations, namely by affecting

small sized specimens and preventing recruitment or at least imposing high mortality of recruits,

producing gaps in size-frequency distributions. The current results also suggest that spatially

close areas under similar anthropogenic pressure may present different demographic patterns if

subjected to different environmental conditions. Indeed, no significant skewness or kurtosis for

the four studied populations were detected in Lagos shallow, suggesting lower natural disturbance

than in Lagos deep. This pattern is similar to those of population of Eunicella singularis and

Paramuricea clavata from the Mediterranean (Linares et al., 2008a). What is more, at this site the

height of gorgonians was significantly higher than all (Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica)

or part (Leptogorgia sarmentosa) of the remaining populations. On the other hand, the positive

skewness values found in Pedra da Greta, Pedra do Barril and Lagos deep point towards some

disturbance, either anthropogenic (fishing/anchoring) or natural (sediment run-off ), which is in

line with the observed in the Mediterranean (Linares et al., 2008a) but not with other studies that

suggest negative skewness values in disturbed areas (Bak and Meesters, 1998; Meesters et al., 2001).

The present data suggest that different species respond differently to disturbance: Eunicella

labiata sizes do not seem to be affected; Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica seem to

be affected by both kinds of stress; and Leptogorgia sarmentosa seems to be affected mainly by

anthropogenic activities. Direct mortality rates caused by disturbance may often be low and not

clearly depicted by size-frequency distributions. However, disturbance may significantly impact

marine species by reducing the fitness and alter energy investment of marine animals, being

an important issue in fisheries (Gaspar and Chícharo, 2007; Shester and Micheli, 2011). In fact,

concerning gorgonians, mortality can be increased due to vulnerability to diseases and fouling

74



CHAPTER 2. INDIRECT EVIDENCE OF HUMAN PRESSURE ON THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND SIZE STRUCTURE
OF GORGONIAN POPULATIONS IN THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL

and regeneration consumes energy that cannot be directed to reproduction and growth, resulting

in reduced reproductive output, low dispersion and low growth rates (Linares et al., 2008c). Even

though size-frequency distribution data of Eunicella labiata did not show significant skewness

and kurtosis, it was observed that partial mortality in Eunicella gazella and Eunicella labiata was

higher in more intensively fished areas than in areas under lower fishing pressure (unpublished

data). Specifically concerning Eunicella labiata, the most frequent damage involved the complete

breaking of one of the two main branches of the colony, not severely affecting the size parameter

that was measured (height), but certainly affecting the biological and ecological aspects of the

species. As suggested by Linares et al. (2008a) and the present data, it is important that size-

frequency distribution data is complemented by damage quantification data in order to properly

assess disturbance effects in gorgonian corals.

2.4.3. Final remarks

The gorgonian assemblages in shallow rocky areas of the Algarve were found to be more

diverse than those of the Mediterranean area, with several dominant species coexisting. The

intricate differences in ecological requirements and resilience to disturbance of gorgonian species

shape their populations with important effects in the dynamics and biodiversity of shallow rocky

communities. Some studies suggest that communities with more species of ecosystem or habitat

engineers present higher biodiversity and are more resilient (Coleman and Williams, 2002), which

reinforces the relevance of the present study area in the context of NE Atlantic biodiversity.

The key role of gorgonians for the community of the infra- and circalittoral rock poses another

challenge, the capacity of these animals to cope with both thermal stress but also pathogens under

climate change, an important issue in the future management of coastal marine ecosystems. The

high abundance of two Eunicella species (Eunicella labiata and Eunicella gazella) characteristic

of the African coast, but that are also present in the Mediterranean (González, 1993; Ocaña et al.,

2000), or in the case of Eunicella gazella also in the Northern coast of Spain (Grasshoff, 1992),

may indicate that these species, original from lower latitudes, are extending their distribution

northwards. In Europe, the increasing sea water temperature as a result of climate change

is inducing the spread of numerous tropical marine species (see references in Bianchi, 2007;

Philippart et al., 2011) presenting new scientific and coastal management challenges (Anna, 2007).

Data on genetic diversity on these gorgonian species could prove if these species are recent

colonizers or if they have established long time ago and have been overlooked due to erroneous

identifications. Furthermore, climate change has been pointed out as the primary responsible for:

i) benthic fauna mass mortality events in the Mediterranean (Coma et al., 2009; Lejeusne et al.,

2010, and references therein); ii) changes on the reproduction of coastal invertebrates (Lawrence

and Soame, 2004), namely octocorals (Linares et al., 2008c); iii) the increase of pathogenic diseases

75

in gorgonians (Martin et al., 2002; Bally and Garrabou, 2007); iv) changes on growth rates and

population structure of corals (Goffredo et al., 2008); and v) changes in calcification rates of

gorgonians (Ferrier-Pagès et al., 2009). Thermotolerance of gorgonians has been observed to be

depth dependent (Teixidó et al., 2011) emphasizing the importance of spatial distribution data in

areas affected by multiple pressures.

In order to fully understand the factors that might be affecting the distribution of gorgonians

in the Algarve, more studies shall be undertaken, with broader scales and complemented by

environmental data and quantitative video-surveys (e.g. on underwater lost fishing gears). As

an example, the use of modern technology such as ROVs has been used to provide solid data

concerning corals distribution at mid and deeper waters impossible to sample by scuba diving

(e.g. Mortensen and Buhl-Mortensen, 2004; Gori et al., 2011a). Quantitative data on fishing effort

per area, and number of lost fishing gears is also important for a more robust interpretation of

the direct and indirect effects of fishing in gorgonian populations. As evidenced by this study,

gorgonian size-frequency distributions can be used as proxy for disturbance effects as these slow

growing long-lived animals can be used as natural data loggers, registering disturbances along

time. However, in order to discriminate between natural and anthropogenic disturbances, size-

frequency data should be complemented by information on secondary colonization and partial

mortality. In this context, the present study provides valuable baseline information that may be

used in future monitoring programs.

PART II. GORGONIANS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED EPIBENTHIC FAUNA

Abstract

To date, few studies have examined the relationship between gorgonians and associated non-

colonial epifaunal assemblages, especially in temperate Atlantic waters. Two species belonging

to two widespread octocoral genera (Leptogorgia and Eunicella) were selected aiming to assess

the variation in composition and structure of their associated epifaunal assemblages with colony

size and host species, as well as to analyse the consistency in space and time of these putative

patterns. One hundred and eighty-one species from 11 different phyla (totalling 7284 individuals)

were identified in 72 replicate colonies. A single colony of Leptogorgia lusitanica, approximately

23 cm width, harboured more than 730 individuals from 63 species. The maximum abundance

in Eunicella gazella (358 individuals) was recorded in a colony of approximately 11 cm width,

while the peak of diversity (55 species) was registered in a larger colony of 23.6 cm width. The

epifaunal assemblages of both gorgonian species were numerically dominated by amphipods,

whereas in terms of diversity, annelids (especially polychaetes) were the richest group in Eunicella

gazella colonies. The RDA analysis indicated a strong relationship of all the size-related attributes

(area, maximum width and height) and Leptogorgia lusitanica epifaunal assemblages, but the

“colonial” epibiont cover (e.g. macroscopic algae, bryozoans, sponges) was also observed to

be determinant in structuring the attendant epifaunal assemblages of both gorgonian species.

Epifaunal assemblage structure differed between gorgonian species with a single taxon (Turbel-

laria) significantly associated with Eunicella gazella colonies and taxa indicated as significantly

associated with Leptogorgia lusitanica colonies. Although both gorgonians shared most of the

species collected, 11 and 18 taxa were exclusively associated with Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia

lusitanica, respectively (without considering singletons). Nevertheless, most of these exclusive

taxa were either rare or uncommon. The exception was the presence of white flatworms Turbellaria

in Eunicella gazella colonies probably taking advantage of crypsis with the white Eunicella gazella

branches. The present study supports the general paradigm that corals (generally for scleractinian

corals) are habitats of enhanced abundance and biodiversity. Gorgonian epifaunal assemblages

not only showed high values of ?-diversity but intricate patterns of variability in their composition

and structure leading to high ?-diversity. Higher ?-diversity values were consistently detected for

raw than for presence/absence data, suggesting that patterns of biodiversity are more affected

by changes in the relative abundance of dominant species rather than in faunal composition.

Although the total pool of species available in gorgonian colonies appears to be the same in both

sites analysed, each colony yields a rather small set of this species pool. All together the colonies

may act as a metacommunity, but the structure of the assemblage in each colony (e.g. total number

of species, dominance) apparently depends upon host attributes.

CHAPTER 3. DIVING INTO SHALLOW-TEMPERATE GORGONIAN GARDENS: BIODIVERSITY PATTERNS OF
ATTENDANT EPIFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES OF VARIABILITY

3.1. Introduction

Coral habitats are one of the most diverse marine habitats (Knowlton et al., 2010), probably

as a consequence of the complexity provided by their three-dimensional structure (Öhman and

Rajasuriya, 1998; Gratwicke and Speight, 2005b; Idjadi and Edmunds, 2006; Lingo and Szedlmayer,

2006; Wilson et al., 2007) upon which several species depend, especially small invertebrates (Stella

et al., 2010; Plaisance et al., 2011). These epifaunal organisms rely on coral colonies for food (e.g.

Burkepile and Hay, 2007; García-Matucheski and Muniain, 2010) and protection against predators

(e.g. Edwards and Emberton, 1980; Vytopil and Willis, 2001; Bergsma and Martinez, 2011), and may

display several interactions with their hosts, including commensalism (Kumagai, 2008), predation

(Burkepile and Hay, 2007; Schoepf et al., 2010; García-Matucheski and Muniain, 2010), symbiosis

(Carricart-Ganivet et al., 2004; Stewart et al., 2006; Bergsma, 2010) and mutualism (Holbrook et al.,

2008; Stachowicz and Hay, 1999; Bergsma and Martinez, 2011). Depending on the nature of the

interaction, coral-associated invertebrates may provide sediment removal (Stewart et al., 2006),

protection from predators (Pratchett, 2001; Stier et al., 2010), and ultimately contribute to enhance

coral growth and survival (Bergsma and Martinez, 2011).

Studies on invertebrate species associated to coral reefs are relatively scarce, especially when

compared to the knowledge on fish-associated assemblages, and most of them have been carried

out in shallow-water Indo-Pacific regions (e.g. Coles, 1980; Edwards and Emberton, 1980; Patton,

1994; Goh et al., 1999; Vytopil and Willis, 2001; Kumagai and Aoki, 2003; Stella et al., 2010). To the

authors’ best knowledge, to date, only three quantitative studies on non-colonial invertebrate as-

semblages associated with corals were undertaken in cold-temperate Atlantic waters (Mortensen

and Buhl-Mortensen, 2004; Buhl-Mortensen and Mortensen, 2005; Greene, 2008). However,

research on the distribution patterns of coral species and associated fauna is required to better

understand their role on coastal ecosystems and to develop sound scientific-based conservation

measures aiming to regulate the sustainable use of these areas. Coral habitats considered as

priority by OSPAR include coral gardens, Lophelia pertusa reefs and sea pen fields. Despite being

one of the richest ecosystems on the planet, coral reefs are also among the most endangered, by

pollution, destructive fishing practices and global climate change (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007;

Carpenter et al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2010). As expected, specialist species (those that depend on

only one or two hosts) will be particularly susceptible to habitat degradation and loss (e.g. Munday,

2004). Therefore, a better understanding of the relationships between corals and associated

organisms, such as small invertebrates, is also crucial for predicting potential biodiversity losses

resulting from coral degradation. Currently, studies on coral-associated fish species revealed that

declines in coral abundance resulted in corresponding decreases in fish abundance and diversity,

with specialist species being more prone to extinction (Jones et al., 2004; Munday, 2004; Pratchett

et al., 2011). In this particular, it is noteworthy that marine reserves might help to mitigate the

91



PART II. GORGONIANS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED EPIBENTHIC FAUNA

problem, but will not always be sufficient to reverse this negative pattern (Jones et al., 2004).

In marine systems, most studies of diversity change across spatial and temporal scales have

been focused on local (?-) and regional (?-) diversity, largely neglecting ?-diversity (turnover

or complementarity) (Gray, 2000; Becking et al., 2006). However, more recently, ?-diversity has

gained renewed interest and has been applied to gain further insights on the diversity patterns

and processes underlying species dynamics at different spatial and temporal scales (e.g. Danovaro

et al., 2009; Thrush et al., 2010; Dimitriadis and Koutsoubas, 2011; Bevilacqua et al., 2012), and

thus pointed out as a valuable conservation tool (Gering et al., 2003). Facing the need for a

better understanding of the relationships between corals and associated epifaunal assemblages,

as well as the scarcity of data concerning cold-temperate octocoral reefs, the present study aims

to describe the patterns of biodiversity, abundance and community structure of the epifaunal

assemblages associated with shallow water gorgonians. The contribution of the inventory (?-

diversity) and differentiation (?-diversity) components of diversity will be analysed across multiple

scales of variability: host species, colony size, site location and time (inter-annual). The role of

gorgonian gardens in promoting regional (?-) diversity will be discussed. Therefore, in the present

study we aim to answer the following questions: 1) will composition and structure of associated

epifaunal assemblage vary with: i) colony size; ii) gorgonian host; 2) are these putative patterns in

composition and structure consistent in: i) space; ii) time.

3.2. Materials and Methods

3.2.1. Studied species

The studied species, Leptogorgia lusitanica and Eunicella gazella, belong to two different

genera with a worldwide distributional range. Although belonging to the family Gorgoniidae,

Leptogorgia lusitanica and Eunicella gazella are morphologically different: Leptogorgia lusitanica

colonies are generally larger in width than in height, while Eunicella gazella colonies are more

evenly shaped (i.e. display similar width and height). Leptogorgia lusitanica colonies may reach

up to 80 cm in width, while Eunicella gazella is a small-sized species reaching a maximum of 30 cm

in height. Branches of Leptogorgia lusitanica may have different colours and are more flexible,

while Eunicella gazella branches are generally thicker and white.

3.2.2. Sampling and laboratory procedures

Sampling was undertaken in two consecutive summers (2010 and 2011) at Pedra da Greta

92



CHAPTER 3. DIVING INTO SHALLOW-TEMPERATE GORGONIAN GARDENS: BIODIVERSITY PATTERNS OF
ATTENDANT EPIFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES OF VARIABILITY

(PG), the main rocky subtidal area in the central part of the Algarve coast, with approximately

3.6 km in length and ranging from 20 to 90 m in width. In PG, two sites (PG1 and PG2) located at

approximately 15 m depth, were randomly selected to account for spatial variability. The summer

period was chosen because it generally corresponds to the peak of invertebrates’ diversity and

abundance in this region.

Because of the variability in size of Leptogorgia lusitanica and Eunicella gazella, and to assess

the influence of colony size in the biodiversity patterns, three size classes were previously estab-

lished based on size frequency distributions of the two gorgonian species (Cúrdia et al., sub.a).

For Leptogorgia lusitanica the size height ranges were: small,&amp;lt;10 cm; medium, 15–25 cm; large,
&gt;30 cm; whereas for Eunicella gazella the height ranges were: small,&amp;lt;8 cm; medium, 10–15 cm;
large, &gt;18 cm. At each site and sampling period, three replicates of each species and colony-
size were collected by scuba diving (36 colonies per sampling occasion). The entire colony was

enclosed in a plastic bag to prevent faunal loss and then carefully detached from the substrate. All

gorgonians were transported to the laboratory for further processing.

In the laboratory, the colonies were preserved in 96 % ethanol. Samples were washed through

a 100 µm mesh sieve and colonies were observed under a magnifying glass to ensure that all

fauna (mobile and sessile epibionts) and flora had been removed. All specimens associated with

each colony were preserved in 96 % ethanol and afterwards identified to the lowest practical

taxonomic level. To estimate species richness, unidentifiable organisms were, whenever possible,

differentiated into different operational taxonomic units (OTUs). If animals were juveniles and/or

were extremely damaged, and it was impossible to recognize whether they were different entities

or belong to any of the already identified species, they were excluded from the analyses. The

abundance of macroscopic algae, cnidarians, bryozoans, sponges and hydrozoans was estimated

by a semi-quantitative index ranging from 0 to 4, (0 – absent; 1 – rare; 2 – common; 3 – abundant;

4 – very abundant). This index will be the sum of the scores of each epibiont observed for each

colony. In order to minimize bias, scoring was always performed by the same observer and for

simplicity, this relative index will be hereafter designated as CEC (as for “colonial” epibiont cover,

where the term colonial is used loosely to represent modular organisms). CEC will be used to infer

the enhancement of functional intricacy of the gorgonian colonies derived from the presence of

attached sessile organisms that may provide additional ecological niches and/or a greater variety

of food resources for the attendant invertebrate assemblages. In the laboratory, the maximum

height and width and the wet weight of each colony were measured (Table 3.1). Colony surface area

was estimated using the image analysis software, ImageJ (Rasband, 2010), on digital photographs

taken in the laboratory.

3.3. Data analysis

Only taxa unambiguously assigned to different identities were considered and included in the

analyses. The number of taxa, Shannon-Wiener diversity (H ?), Pielou evenness index (J ? Pielou,
1969) and Hurlbert (1971) expected species richness (E S(n)) were calculated and used to describe

patterns in biodiversity and to assess changes in community structure. Hurlbert’s expected

number of species, which can be rarefied to the same number of individuals (equal or lower than

the lowest common number of individuals), is probably the most adequate estimate of biodiversity

for the present study, because of the implications of size and shape on the total available area

for colonization of each gorgonian colony. ?-diversity was analysed in terms of complementarity

(differences between colonies of different sizes, different species and different sites), and turnover

(differences between consecutive years). In order to evaluate the level of dissimilarity in species

composition and assemblage structure, we calculated the Bray-Curtis coefficients of dissimilarity

based on the presence/absence and raw data matrices, respectively.

An analysis of similarities by randomization/permutation tests (ANOSIM) was performed

on the samples grouped according to the relevant factors (colony size, host species, site and

time). Specifically, four tests were undertaken. Test 1 was undertaken for factor “colony size”

(3 levels: small, medium and large) separately for Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica.

Test 2 was undertaken for factor “gorgonian host” (2 levels: Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia

lusitanica), aiming at assessing differences between sites and sampling years separately. Tests

3 and 4 were carried out for the evaluation of spatial (PG1 vs PG2) and temporal consistency

(2010 vs 2011). Differences in epifaunal assemblage structure between gorgonian hosts, as well

as the relationship between assemblage structure and habitat characteristics, were analysed

by a distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) (McArdle and Anderson, 2001). Size-related

attributes of gorgonian colonies, such as total surface area, maximum width and height were

used as habitat characteristics and CEC was also used as an additional attribute, because of

its recognized role for the occurrence and abundance of mobile invertebrates (Guerra-García,

2001; Cacabelos et al., 2010). To analyse the contribution of each species to the discrimination

of the epifaunal assemblages associated with both gorgonians, the indicator value (IndVal) was

CHAPTER 3. DIVING INTO SHALLOW-TEMPERATE GORGONIAN GARDENS: BIODIVERSITY PATTERNS OF
ATTENDANT EPIFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES OF VARIABILITY

used (Dufrêne and Legendre, 1997). Epifaunal species overlap and the existence of potential

habitat-specialists was also analysed by comparing both datasets with and without singletons (i.e.

taxon represented by a single organism or found on a single colony). Potential habitat-specialists

are distinguished from rare taxa based on their frequency distribution across replicates of each

gorgonian species (Stella et al., 2010). Indeed, taxa collected from only one of the hosts could

either be: i) rare taxa that have a low rate of occurrence regardless of host; ii) species that do not use

gorgonians as a preferred habitat and therefore are rarely found; or iii) habitat-specialists that only

occur on certain hosts (Stella et al., 2010). Consequently, the occurrence rates were also evaluated

when singletons were removed from the dataset (Stella et al., 2010). All statistical analyses were

performed using the open source software R version 12.1 (R Development Core Team, 2010).

3.4. Results

A total of 181 taxa were identified from the 72 gorgonian colonies (Eunicella gazella – 124

taxa; Leptogorgia lusitanica – 144 taxa). These taxa were ascribed to 11 phyla, 15 classes, 41

orders, 99 families and 150 genera comprising a total of 7284 individuals. Overall, Leptogorgia

lusitanica colonies had more taxa and harboured more individuals than those of Eunicella gazella

(Leptogorgia lusitanica – 4382 individuals; Eunicella gazella – 2902 individuals). Regarding the

taxonomic composition at the highest taxonomic level (phylum), the general pattern was very

similar for both gorgonian species. Epifaunal assemblages associated with both gorgonians were

numerically dominated by arthropods, accounting for up to 48 % and 65 % of total abundance in

Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica, respectively. Molluscs were also abundant in both

gorgonians (18 % in Eunicella gazella and 22 % in Leptogorgia lusitanica) and Platyhelminthes,

which were exclusive of Eunicella gazella epifaunal assemblages, were the second most abundant

group in this species. In terms of richness (i.e. the number of different OTUs), annelids (and

especially polychaetes) were highly diverse (over 33 % of total species on both gorgonians).

3.4.1. Biodiversity patterns

The abundance (i.e. the number of individuals per colony) varied from 6 to 358 in Eunicella

gazella and from 8 to 737 in Leptogorgia lusitanica. In 2010, the mean abundance of epifauna

was higher in Leptogorgia lusitanica colonies (154.4±42.5 individuals) than in Eunicella gazella
colonies (62.3±16.3 individuals), whereas in 2011 values were slightly higher in Eunicella gazella
(98.9±19.2 individuals) than in Leptogorgia lusitanica (89.1±25.8 individuals) (Figure 3.1). The
number of taxa per colony varied between 4 and 55 in Eunicella gazella, ranging form 5 to 63

in Leptogorgia lusitanica. Mean species richness per colony was consistently lower in Eunicella

3.4.2. Effect of colony size

Hurlbert’s E S(100) values ranged in Eunicella gazella from 19.8 (small-sized colonies in PG2)

to 34.6 (large-sized colonies in PG2), while in Leptogorgia lusitanica values ranged from 18.4

(small-sized colonies in PG2) to 34.5 (medium-sized colonies in PG2) (Table 3.2). Minimum

and maximum values were comparable for both gorgonians, but while in Eunicella gazella there

was a steady increase in the number of species with colony size, in Leptogorgia lusitanica this

increase was abrupt from small to medium-sized colonies (Table 3.2). In both hosts, the number

of individuals per colony was also lower in small than medium to large-sized colonies, but there

was no clear pattern for J ?. Large colonies of Eunicella gazella and medium colonies of Leptogorgia
lusitanica (both in PG2) had the highest E S(100) and J

? values and offered more redundancy to the
overall biodiversity in terms of expected number of species (Figure 3.2 and Table 3.2). However,

there was always some degree of complementarity in the assemblages of different colonies, as the

pooled number of species for each colony size was always much lower than the grand total for each

host species (Table 3.2). Although different in terms of species composition, small-sized colonies

generally showed more similar values of N, S and E S(100) between gorgonian species than larger

colonies (Table 3.2). The main differences for each gorgonian host were found between small

colonies and the remaining size classes. ANOSIM analysis confirmed this trend, indicating that

community structure and composition were significant different between small- and medium- to

large-sized colonies but not between medium and large colonies (Table 3.3, Test 1).

3.4.3. Effect of gorgonian host

The epifaunal assemblage associated with Eunicella gazella usually showed much lower abund-

ance than in the one associated with Leptogorgia lusitanica and often slightly lower values of

the biodiversity indices both of ?-diversity (S, E S100, H
?; Table 3.2) and ?-diversity (average

dissimilarity between colonies; Figure 3.3 B1, B2, C1 and C2). The variation in abundance

and specific composition, leading to the differences observed in the community structure, can

be illustrated by J ? values; in general, evenness was higher in Leptogorgia lusitanica than in
Eunicella gazella (Table 3.2). The higher dominance of the epifaunal assemblages associated

with Eunicella gazella was also confirmed by the cumulative percentage of abundance of the

three most abundant taxa (Table 3.4). Despite some rank shifts, in Eunicella gazella the same

three taxa, Erichthonius punctatus, an undetermined species of Turbellaria and Ostracoda, shared

consistently more than 50 % dominance irrespective to size, site or year, while in Leptogorgia

lusitanica the first three ranks of dominance, accounting for 35 to 54 % dominance were shared by

five different taxa (four amphipod species and Ostracoda), depending on colony size, site and year

(Table 3.4). Differences between the assemblages associated with the two gorgonian hosts were

always significant irrespective to site or year (ANOSIM Test 2, Table 3.3). The complementarity of

the assemblages from Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica is shown by the comparison of

the rarefaction curves for each gorgonian species and “Total” in Figure 3.2, but also by the high

median dissimilarity between colonies when the estimates include comparisons between both

hosts (Figure 3.3 A1 and A2).

Of the 181 OTUs identified, 48.1 % (87 species) were common to both gorgonian hosts, whereas

37 species (20.4 %) were exclusively found in Eunicella gazella colonies and 57 species (31.5 %)

only occurred in Leptogorgia lusitanica. However, among those exclusive taxa, there were several

singletons. Removing singletons from the analysis, the percentage of exclusive taxa dropped to

a total of 16 % (corresponding to 29 taxa, 11 exclusive of Eunicella gazella and 18 exclusive of

Leptogorgia lusitanica, Table 3.5). From these taxa, only the undetermined species of Turbellaria

was frequent and abundant in Eunicella gazella colonies. Only five other taxa occurred in more

than 10 % of the colonies, namely the bivalve Glans sp. in Eunicella gazella and Ophiuridae

sp.B, and the polychaetes Lumbrineris tetraura, Serpula vermicularis and Syllis cf. columbretensis

in Leptogorgia lusitanica (Table 3.5). The remaining taxa displayed either low abundance or

frequency of occurrence (Table 3.5).

CHAPTER 3. DIVING INTO SHALLOW-TEMPERATE GORGONIAN GARDENS: BIODIVERSITY PATTERNS OF
ATTENDANT EPIFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES OF VARIABILITY

The dbRDA indicated that the first two ordination axes explain 84 % of the fitted variation

(explained size-related attributes and CEC) comprising about 16 % of the total variation. The

ordination plot also revealed a general separation of the epifaunal assemblages associated with the

two gorgonian species (along the YY axis, CAP2). The length of the vectors also indicates that size-

related attributes of the hosts were relevant for this discrimination. The Turbellaria undetermined

species (absent from Leptogorgia lusitanica colonies) was responsible for the separation between

gorgonian species, while the remaining taxa were much more abundant in Leptogorgia lusitanica

colonies (Figure 3.4). Indeed, the IndVal identified Turbellaria as the only taxon with a significant

association with Eunicella gazella (IndVal = 0.986, p &amp;lt;0.001). On the other hand, the molluscs
Simnia spelta (IndVal = 0.850, p &amp;lt;0.001) and Tritonia sp. (IndVal = 0.757, p &amp;lt;0.01), the crustaceans
Astacilla sp. (IndVal = 0.773, p &amp;lt;0.001), Caprella fretensis (IndVal = 0.723, p &amp;lt;0.001), Janira
maculosa (IndVal = 0.590, p &amp;lt;0.01) and Stenothoe cf. cavimana (IndVal = 0.543, p &amp;lt;0.05), as well
as the anemone Corynactis viridis (IndVal = 0.657, p &amp;lt;0.01) were all significantly associated with
Leptogorgia lusitanica.

3.4.4. Spatial and temporal patterns

Despite all the variability found in the attendant assemblages depending on gorgonian colony

size or host species, these effects do not translate into a significant spatial effect between sites

(ANOSIM Test 3, Table 3.3).

Differences in the attendant epifaunal assemblages between years were always highly signific-

ant either considering each species separately or both species together (ANOSIM Test 4, Table 3.3).

In opposition to the observations related to location, there was a change in the total pool of species

of the two consecutive years. Turnover was always above 60 % (either considering each species

separately or both species together) and resulted mostly from replacement of rare species but

also from changes in the dominant species, especially in the epifaunal assemblage of Leptogorgia

lusitanica (Table 3.4). An increase in ?-diversity (S, E S(100)) was also observed in 2011, but although

the highest increase in number of species was observed in Eunicella gazella it was the increase in

evenness of the Leptogorgia lusitanica assemblages (accompanied by a decrease in abundance)

that contributed the most to the higher values of E S(100) in 2011 (Table 3.2 and Figure 3.2). In

fact, the rarefaction curves for LL2011, EG+LL2011 and Total (Figure 3.2 D) show almost complete

overlap. On the other hand, in general, ?-diversity was lower in 2011 (Figure 3.3), with the decrease

in median dissimilarity more accentuated in the Eunicella gazella assemblage (Figure 3.3 C1 and

C2).

In both gorgonians, complementarity was higher when considering the raw abundance data

when compared to the presence/absence matrix (Figure 3.3). This was also observed for differ-

ences between gorgonian hosts, indicating that community structure (relative abundance) rather

than species composition had a higher contribution to patterns of complementarity.

3.5. Discussion

Epifaunal assemblages associated with the gorgonians Leptogorgia lusitanica and Eunicella

gazella from shallow North Atlantic waters were rich (181 taxa) and abundant (7284 individuals).

Eleven phyla were identified in the branches and upper basis of just two gorgonian species (36

colonies each). From the literature available (Table 3.6), values observed in the current study are

comparable to the ones reported by Stella et al. (2010) within the branches of four scleractinian

corals (12 phyla, 178 nominal species) in the Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef, Australia), and

much larger than those found by Goh et al. (1999) and Kumagai and Aoki (2003) in shallow water

gorgonians’ from Singapore (seven phyla) and Japan (five phyla), respectively (Table 3.6). A single

gorgonian colony of Leptogorgia lusitanica, approximately 23 cm width, harboured more than 730

individuals from 63 species. The maximum abundance in Eunicella gazella (358 individuals) was

recorded in a colony of approximately 11 cm width, while the peak of diversity (55 species) was

registered in a larger colony measuring 23.6 cm width. Overall, the abundance values observed

105



PART II. GORGONIANS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED EPIBENTHIC FAUNA

in the present study are almost three times the values reported by Stella et al. (2010), although

mesh-sieves are not comparable. It is expected that using a sieve with a larger mesh, abundance

would be lower, but this was not observed in faunal assemblages associated with Leptogorgia hebes,

Leptogorgia virgulata, and Titanideum frauenfeldii in shallow Atlantic waters from the coast of

Georgia (Greene, 2008). In that study, 15 gorgonian colonies harboured over 56 000 individuals

from 11 phyla (Table 3.6). Therefore, it is evident that shallow cold-temperate water gorgonians

are relevant for the enhancement of local diversity and abundance of invertebrates, reinforcing

the need for their conservation. Amongst the few quantitative studies on the relationship between

coral reef communities and associated-invertebrates, Idjadi and Edmunds (2006) found that in the

Caribbean reefs, scleractinian traits (namely, coral diversity, percentage cover of live coral, and

the topographic complexity created by coral skeletons) were positively related with the diversity

of reef-associated invertebrates. Besides, the enhancement of biodiversity is not restricted to the

coral skeleton area, as it may be extended to the surrounding sediments (Cerrano et al., 2009).

The epifaunal assemblages of both gorgonian species were numerically dominated by arth-

ropods, whereas in terms of diversity, annelids (especially polychaetes) were the richest group

in Eunicella gazella colonies. Among arthropods, amphipods were the dominant taxa in both

gorgonians contributing for a considerable proportion of total epifauna (37 % for Eunicella gazella

and 46 % for Leptogorgia lusitanica). The dominance of amphipod species among crustacean

fauna associated with gorgonians had also been reported for shallow (Greene, 2008) and deep

(Mortensen and Buhl-Mortensen, 2004) Atlantic waters, as well as for shallow waters from the

Indo-Pacific region (Goh et al., 1999; Kumagai and Aoki, 2003). In general, the composition

of amphipod fauna was very similar (especially at family and genus level) to the reported for

other Atlantic areas (Mortensen and Buhl-Mortensen, 2004; Greene, 2008), with the dominance

of Caprellidae (Caprella), Ischyroceridae (Erichthonius, Ischyrocerus and Jassa), Photidae (Gam-

maropsis and Photis) and Stenothoidae (Stenothoe, in the present study; Metopa in deep-water

gorgonians). The specimens of the genus Caprella, Stenothoe, Erichthonius and Jassa were also

among the dominant fauna of artificial reefs in the Algarve region (Moura et al., 2007, 2008). On

the other hand, the dominance of the genus Caprella in association with gorgonians had also been

reported for Indo-Pacific shallow waters (Kumagai and Aoki, 2003), where gorgonian mortality has

been reported related to a massive attack by caprellids (Metaprotella sandalensis) (Scinto et al.,

2008).

Although considerably abundant among scleractinian coral hosts (e.g. Stella et al., 2010), am-

phipods are not dominant, being replaced by decapods (Table 3.6). Therefore, a consistent trend

seems to emerge from the compilation of these studies indicating a dominance of amphipods

among octocorals, whereas decapods dominate among hexacoral hosts (Table 3.6). Further

investigation is, however, needed to confirm this trend, as studies are still scarce and differed

on sampling procedures. A probable reason for this pattern is the higher availability of refuges

106



CHAPTER 3. DIVING INTO SHALLOW-TEMPERATE GORGONIAN GARDENS: BIODIVERSITY PATTERNS OF
ATTENDANT EPIFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES OF VARIABILITY

provided by sceleractian corals when compared to gorgonians, as it is known that crabs benefit

from their association with corals by gaining refuge from predators (e.g. Stachowicz and Hay, 1999;

Vytopil and Willis, 2001). This supports the earlier findings of Edwards and Emberton (1980) that

reported the negative correlation between increased branching openness and decreased numbers

of decapods in epifaunal assemblages associated with Stylophora pistillata (scleractinian), while

Vytopil and Willis (2001) also suggested that branch tightness contributes to the protection of

associated epifauna. The diversity of annelids assemblage associated with both gorgonians is by far

higher than the reported by Goh et al. (1999) for shallow gorgonians from Singapore. On the other

hand, based on studies performed for other coral groups, it seems that diversity of polychaetes is

probably higher within gorgonians than among scleractinian species (e.g. Stella et al., 2010). Once

more this needs confirmation as it can result from sampling bias.

3.5.1. Host attributes and associated biodiversity patterns

Non-colonial invertebrates were observed in all colonies sampled and, in general, Leptogorgia

lusitanica harboured richer and more abundant assemblages, which can be at least partially

explained by the resulting greater colonisable area of their colonies. Based on our results,

colony size and time rather than location were the main drivers of variability in the attendant

assemblages of the two gorgonian species. Increasing colony size translates directly into an

increasing colonisable area, and, consequently, into a species-area effect, while inter-annual

differences may reflect the dynamics of species life cycles (e.g. availability of recruits, success of

recruitment), the response of individual species to environmental variability and at least partially

a random drift in the composition of the assemblages from one year to another.

CHAPTER 3. DIVING INTO SHALLOW-TEMPERATE GORGONIAN GARDENS: BIODIVERSITY PATTERNS OF
ATTENDANT EPIFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES OF VARIABILITY

Although live surface area of corals was found to have no correlation either with abundance

or species richness in Acropora colonies (Vytopil and Willis, 2001), the dbRDA analysis indicated

strong relationships of size-related attributes (surface area, maximum width and height) and

Leptogorgia lusitanica epifaunal assemblages. For both gorgonian species, small-sized colonies

contributed the least for the overall biodiversity and showed significantly different epifaunal

assemblages compared to medium- and large-sized colonies, confirming the relevance of colony

size to biodiversity patterns in gorgonian gardens.

The colonial epibiont cover (e.g. macroscopic algae, sponges, bryozoans) was also observed to

be determinant in structuring epifaunal assemblages of both gorgonian species. It is known that

some of the dominant epifaunal taxa, such as caprellid amphipods, may also be closely associated

with some of these colonial epizoans (e.g. briozoans, hydroids) (Aoki and Kikuchi, 1990; Guerra-

García, 2001). Therefore, it is difficult to discern whether their abundance is due to the gorgonian

itself or to the associated colonial organisms. The results of the dbRDA analysis supported the

existence of a different structure in the epifaunal assemblage of the two gorgonian species. A single

taxon (Turbellaria) was significantly associated with Eunicella gazella colonies, clearly resulting

from its exclusivity to this host and its abundance and frequency of occurrence. On the other hand,

seven taxa, although not exclusive, were indicated as significantly associated with Leptogorgia lusi-

tanica colonies. These taxa were two gastropods (Simnia spelta and Tritonia sp.), four crustaceans

(Astacilla sp., Caprella fretensis, Janira maculosa and Stenothoe cf. cavimana), and one cnidarian

Corynactis viridis. Simnia spelta, Tritonia sp. and Corynactis viridis had already been reported

as associated with gorgonians (Patton, 1972; Goh et al., 1999; Rodrigues, 2008; García-Matucheski

and Muniain, 2010). Although both gorgonians shared most of the species collected, 11 and 18 taxa

were exclusively associated with Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica, respectively (without

considering singletons), supporting the existence of specificity of some taxa probably because

of morphological differences between gorgonian species. Nevertheless, most of these exclusive

taxa presented either low abundance or low frequency. The exception was one undetermined

species of Turbellaria occurring in Eunicella gazella colonies. These white flatworms, which colour

resembles the colour of Eunicella gazella branches, may take advantage of crypsis (Goh et al.,

1999). We hypothesize that this specificity may reflect a strategy to avoid predation. Besides

Turbellaria, only six amongst the exclusive taxa observed in each species showed a frequency of

occurrence over 10 %: the bivalve Glans sp. in Eunicella gazella; the polychaetes Lumbrineris

tetraura, Serpula vermicularis and Syllis cf. columbretensis and Ophiuridae sp.B in Leptogorgia

lusitanica. Serpula vermicularis was already found within dead coral colonies and rocky substrates

in deep Mediterranean waters (Mastrototaro et al., 2010), while Lumbrineris tetraura has been

associated with soft (Bone and Klein, 2000) and hard (Giangrande et al., 2003) bottoms, as well as

within seagrass meadows (Gambi et al., 1998). Serpula vermicularis has been frequently observed

in hard bottoms from southern Portugal, particularly in artificial reefs (Moura et al., 2007, 2008),

where L. tetraura and Syllis cf. columbretensis can also be less frequently found and presenting low

109

abundance (unpubl. data). On the other hand, the bivalves from genus Glans had been identified

from fishing trawling samples in the study area (Malaquias et al., 2006). Therefore, these taxa

cannot be considered gorgonian-obligate.

Currently, over 860 invertebrate species were described as being associated with coral species;

at least half of them appear to have an obligate dependence on live corals and several species show

a high degree of preference for one or two coral species (see Stella et al., 2010, for a review). Further

research is needed, as these obligate associations and habitat specialization may contribute to a

greater risk of extinction of associated invertebrates, especially taking into account the current

scenario of ongoing degradation of coral habitats (Stella et al., 2010). Disregarding the level

of dependence on the coral host, all taxonomic components symbiotic assemblages should be

considered, as all have the capacity to contribute to the functioning of coral habitats (Gates and

Ainsworth, 2011).

3.5.2. Biodiversity patterns: implications for future studies

Overall, the gorgonian species analysed in the present study appear to conform to the general

paradigm that corals (generally for scleractinian corals) are habitats of enhanced abundance

and biodiversity. Therefore, gorgonians, as foundation species (Roff and Zacharias, 2011) in the

marine environment, promote the existence of a wide diversity of species which may reflect the

multiple microhabitats available within each colony (Buhl-Mortensen and Mortensen, 2005). Our

results show not only the high values of ?-diversity in the epifaunal assemblages associated with

the gorgonian hosts but also intricate patterns of variability in the composition and structure

of these assemblages leading to high values of ?-diversity. The analysis of ?-diversity showed

the complementarity between individual colonies of different sizes and between colonies of

different host species as well as an important inter-annual turnover in the attendant assemblages.

Each individual colony encloses a small and highly variable subset of the total pool of species.

The aggregation of colonies facilitates a metacommunity dynamics for which random drift of

individuals between colonies may have a strong contribution and explains the lack of significant

spatial variation at the local level. In a metacommunity dynamic resulting from ecological

connectivity (Leibold et al., 2004), patterns of biodiversity are more affected by changes in the

relative abundance of dominant species rather than in faunal composition. On the other hand,

some characteristics of the attendant assemblages appear to be driven or at least affected by

the attributes of their hosts. The host species may be relevant in attracting preferentially some

attendant species and somehow also determine dominance patterns while colony size has a

significant effect on the abundance and number of species of the attendant assemblage. Also,

a high turnover in these epifaunal assemblages was observed and we hypothesize that this

temporal fluidity in composition and structure are related to multiple factors including not only a

110

ATTENDANT EPIFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES OF VARIABILITY

component of stochasticity but also life history events and response to environmental variability.

3.5.3. Final remarks

Besides being scarce, studies on the coral-associated epifaunal assemblages do not usually

assess the ?-diversity component and, consequently, are of limited use for comparisons with the

present study. Our observations have important implications for the design of future biodiversity

assessment studies, highlighting the need to take into account not only ?- but also ?-diversity

(both complementarity and turnover) for an accurate perception of the habitat and its dynamics.

More than focusing on a single gorgonian species, conservation efforts should be placed on the

whole habitat encompassing different hosts and the size structure of their populations. Our

findings support the recent proposal of “coral gardens” in south Portugal and Spain for the OSPAR

list of protected habitats (Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-

East Atlantic) (Anonymous, 2011).

PART II. GORGONIANS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED EPIBENTHIC FAUNA

Abstract

Coral reefs and aggregations are generally recognized among the richest marine habitats but,

there are only a few quantitative studies describing the relationships between corals’ attributes

and their associated epifaunal assemblages. The present study constitutes the first attempt to

explicitly quantify the link between gorgonians (Octocorallia: Alcyonacea) and the abundance and

species richness of associated non-colonial epifaunal invertebrates. These community descriptors

showed a significant correlation to the measured colony attributes of the gorgonians Leptogorgia

lusitanica and Eunicella gazella, namely the surface available for colonization (colony height,

width and area), complexity and heterogeneity (fractal dimension and lacunarity respectively)

and “colonial” epibiont cover (colonial fauna and macroscopic algae). The results highlight

the variation in epifaunal assemblage response to gorgonian colony characteristics, even when

these are closely related and share similar evolutive histories, like in the present case. The

nature and intensity of the relationships were not only gorgonian species-dependent but varied

from one taxonomic group to another. In all faunal groups associated with the two gorgonian

species analysed, the species richness and abundance were strongly correlated with “colonial”

epibiont cover. In fact, colonial epibiont cover possibly due to a trophic effect (direct or indirect

enhancement of food availability) combined with the surface available for colonization (species-

area effect) were the strongest predictors of species richness and abundance. On the other hand,

although structural complexity is usually indicated as the main driver for the rich and abundant

coral-associated assemblages, fractal dimension and heterogeneity were only relevant for the

assemblages associated with Leptogorgia lusitanica. The validity of the paradigm that structural

complexity enhances biodiversity may be scale-dependent. In the case of gorgonians, the effect

of complexity at the “garden” level may be much more relevant than at the individual colony level

reinforcing the need for the conservation of gorgonian aggregation areas as a whole in order to

preserve host diversity and size structure.

Keywords: gorgonians • invertebrate biodiversity • structural complexity • fractal dimen-

sion • lacunarity • multiple regression

4.1. Introduction

A likely mechanism by which marine habitats might influence associated animal assemblages

is through provision of complex habitats; in general structurally complex marine habitats (e.g.

sponge and octocoral aggregations, coral reefs) support a greater number of species than simple

ones (e.g. Gratwicke and Speight, 2005b). A wider range of niche availability (Attrill et al.,

1996; Kovalenko et al., 2012), refuge against predators (Jordan et al., 1996; Vytopil and Willis,

2001; Gratwicke and Speight, 2005a; Lingo and Szedlmayer, 2006) and increased availability of

colonizable surface translated in a species-area relationship (Dean and Connell, 1987; Attrill et al.,

2000, but see Matias et al., 2010) have been suggested as potential explanations for the higher

biodiversity of complex systems. Testing the role of habitat complexity rigorously is difficult

because of the lack of a widely accepted and objective measure of habitat complexity (Parker

et al., 2001) but several proxies have been applied to coral reef areas: surface topography of the

bottom (Öhman and Rajasuriya, 1998), visual estimation of habitat topography (encompassing

reef topography, reef height, rugosity and number of refuge cavities; Wilson et al. 2007), cover of

branching coral colonies (Chabanet et al., 1997), acoustic roughness (Bejarano et al., 2011), habitat

assessment score (integrating rugosity, variety of growth forms, height, refuge size categories,

percentage live cover and percentage hard substratum; Gratwicke and Speight 2005b), and fractal

dimension (Bradbury and Reichelt, 1983; Knudby and LeDrew, 2007; Zawada et al., 2010). At the

scale of the individual colony, fractal dimension has also been applied to quantify coral shape

(Martin-Garin et al., 2007), morphological variability (Kruszyn?ski et al., 2007) or even for modelling

coral growth (Merks et al., 2003). Measurement of fractal dimension (D ) allows obtaining a formal

estimate of a habitat’s physical complexity regardless the specific structural components (Beck,

2000).

The biodiversity of coral habitats is dominated by invertebrates that rely on corals for food,

shelter or settlement cues (see Stella et al., 2011, for a review). Because of their mainly sedentary

behaviour or reduced mobility, small invertebrates are expected to have stronger relationships

with habitat characteristics (shape, niche availability, complexity) than fish and, consequently, are

potentially more susceptible to habitat change (Stella et al., 2010). The role of coral host attributes

in structuring associated invertebrates’ assemblages have been assessed for the hexacorals Pocil-

lopora and Acropora (Vytopil and Willis, 2001; Stella et al., 2010, and references therein) but not

for octocoral species, such as gorgonians. Although most studies indicate a relationship between

epifaunal abundance and species richness and the habitat structure of coral colonies (Abele and

Patton, 1976; Coles, 1980; Julian Caley et al., 2001; Vytopil and Willis, 2001; Stella et al., 2010)

results were not consistent. Although a few studies focusing on invertebrate fauna associated with

gorgonians (Octocorallia: Alcyonacea) were already undertaken, little information is available,

especially in shallow temperate Atlantic waters, about the actual contribution of gorgonians to

local biodiversity, and in what extent gorgonian attributes affects this relationship. As other corals,

gorgonians have been pointed out as foundational species in the sense that they maintain a high

biodiversity of their attendant assemblages both at the aggregation and at the individual colony

levels, namely by providing a great variety of niches, ranging from sheltered cavities to high water-

flow areas with little sedimentation (Buhl-Mortensen and Mortensen, 2005).

“Coral gardens” (mainly gorgonian aggregations) are frequent in NE Atlantic and Mediter-

ranean Sea (Gori et al., 2011a) and were recently proposed for the OSPAR (Convention for the

Protection of the marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic) list of protected habitats (An-

onymous, 2011), because of their vulnerability and high conservation value. In a previous study

we demonstrated the high biodiversity associated with gorgonian gardens in the south of Portugal

(Carvalho et al., sub.). Herein we provide the first quantitative data on the relationship and

consistency between the abundance and biodiversity of the attendant epifaunal assemblages and

a set of gorgonian colony attributes intended to represent the effects of the surface available for

colonization, the structural complexity and heterogeneity, and the functional (trophic) intricacy.

In previous studies namely on epifaunal assemblages associated with seagrasses and macroal-

gae, epiphytes were found to have a relevant role in structuring associated mobile epifaunal

assemblages (Cacabelos et al., 2010). Therefore, they were also considered in the present study.

Specifically, we assessed the following hypotheses: i) higher surface area will result in increasing

diversity and abundance of associated epifaunal organisms; ii) higher structural complexity of

gorgonians will result in increasing diversity and abundance of associated epifaunal organisms;

iii) “colonial” epibiont cover (e.g. bryozoans, hydrozoans, sponges and macroalgae) of gorgonians

has a relevant role in structuring attendant epifaunal assemblages; and iv) different taxonomic and

or functional groups will respond differently to gorgonian attributes as they have different habitat

requisites.

4.2. Materials and Methods

4.2.1. Gorgonian species selected and their attributes

The genera Leptogorgia and Eunicella have a worldwide distribution. For the purposes of

the present study, the species Leptogorgia lusitanica and Eunicella gazella were selected, which

are widely distributed in the region and among the most abundant gorgonians in the southern

Portuguese coast (Cúrdia et al., sub.a). Although both species belong to the family Gorgoniidae,

morphologically they are different: Leptogorgia lusitanica colonies are generally larger in width

than in height, while Eunicella gazella colonies are more evenly shaped (i.e. display similar width

and height). Leptogorgia lusitanica colonies may reach up to 80 cm in width, while Eunicella

gazella is a small-sized species reaching a maximum of 35 cm in height. Branches of Leptogorgia

lusitanica may have different colours, while Eunicella gazella branches are generally white and

thicker.

In order to assess the effect of surface available for colonization we measured the height and

maximum width of each colony and estimated the total surface area. Both, maximum height

and width were measured in the laboratory, where each colony was photographed with a digital

122

camera at right angles (90°) using a tripod to keep a fixed linear distance to the gorgonian,

maintaining scale. The estimation of the total surface area was based on the photos using the

ImageJ software (Rasband, 2010). The estimation of the total surface area instead of volume

resulted from the relative bi-dimensional structure of the gorgonians. Structural complexity

was inferred by measuring fractal dimension (D ), while lacunarity was calculated as a proxy for

heterogeneity, based on the photos of each colony and using the ImageJ software. Specifically,

for fractal analysis it was used the Box-Couting method, which involves laying a square mesh grid

of various sizes (r ), over the gorgonian image (fractal) to count how many boxes (N ), are needed

to cover it completely. To implement the Box-Counting Method, the plugin FracLac for Image J

(Karperien, 2012) was used. The sizes of the square box forming the grid varied from 2 to 200 pixels

using the following custom sizes (2, 4, 8, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200). The number of boxes (N ) that

contain any part of the fractal object (gorgonian) were automatically counted for each iteration

with different box sizes. The fractal dimension, which is characteristic of the morphology, i.e., the

overall structure of the gorgonian colony, is defined as the structural fractal dimension (D )

D = log N
log r

and it was calculated by the program as the mean fractal dimension over 50 scans of differing

grid positions. This fractal dimension is meaningful for objects with complex outlines such as

gorgonians (Martin-Garin et al., 2007).

Lacunarity describes the texture of a fractal, using the size distribution of holes of that fractal. If

a fractal has large gaps or holes, it has high lacunarity (Karperien, 2012). Lacunarity was calculated

as:

E?r = 1 +
?r

µr

2

where ? is the standard deviation of the number of pixels and µ is the average number of pixels in

squares of size r . During the calculation of E? the pixels of the image background were considered

together with the object pixels. The mean lacunarity value was calculated for 50 grids of different

origin.

Besides these morphological attributes, the abundance of macroscopic algae, cnidarians,

bryozoans, sponges and hydrozoans was scored by a semi-quantitative index ranging from 0 to

4 (0 – absent; 1 – rare; 2 – common; 3 – abundant; 4 – very abundant). Scoring was always

carried out by the same observer in order to minimize bias. For simplicity, this relative index will

be hereafter designated as CEC (as for “colonial” epibiont cover, where the term colonial is used

loosely to represent modular organisms). CEC will be used to infer the enhancement of functional

intricacy of the gorgonian colonies derived from the presence of sessile organisms which may

provide additional ecological niches and/or a greater variety of food resources for the attendant

invertebrate assemblages. For each colony, CEC will be the sum of the scores of each epibiont

4.2.2. Study areas and sampling design

Sampling was undertaken in two consecutive summers (2010 and 2011), at Pedra da Greta (PG),

the main rocky subtidal area in the central part of the Algarve coast, with approximately 3.6 km in

length and ranging from 20–90 m in width and located at approximately 15 m depth (see Cúrdia

et al., sub.a; Carvalho et al., sub., for more details). The summer period was chosen because it

generally corresponds to the peak of invertebrates’ diversity and abundance in this region. In each

sampling period, 18 colonies of each species were collected with different length-sizes totalling

72 colonies. Each colony was enclosed in a plastic bag to prevent faunal loss and then carefully

detached from the substrate. All gorgonians were transported to the laboratory for processing.

4.2.3. Biodiversity of attendant assemblages

In the laboratory the colonies were preserved in 96 % ethanol. All samples were washed through

a 100 µm mesh sieve and colonies were observed under a magnifying glass to ensure that all fauna

(mobile epifauna and colonial epibionts) and flora had been removed. All specimens associated

with each colony were preserved in 96 % ethanol and afterwards identified to the lowest practice

taxonomic level. To estimate species richness (i.e. the number of species per colony), uniden-

tifiable organisms were, whenever possible, differentiated into different operational taxonomic

units (OTUs). If animals were juveniles and/or were extremely damaged and it was not possible

to recognize whether they were different entities or belong to any of the already identified species,

they were not used in the analyses. The number of taxa and individuals per colony, as well as the

(Hurlbert, 1971) expected number of species E S(100) were calculated both for the whole assemblage

and for the main taxonomic groups separately (Arthropoda, Mollusca, Polychaeta). Feeding habits

were also ascribed for all OTUs with more than 10 individuals, based on literature available.

4.2.4. Data analysis

In order to assess the relationship between gorgonian attributes (Table 4.1) and the biodiversity

and abundance of the attendant epifaunal assemblage, Spearman rank correlations were per-

formed. The best combination of gorgonian attributes explaining the diversity and abundance

patterns of the attendant epifaunal assemblages were determined using a backwards-stepwise

multiple generalized linear regression. This approach, recommended whenever co-linearity

between independent variables is suspected (Haedrich et al., 2008), begins with a full model,

including all independent variables. Then, based on standard criteria, the variables failing at

contributing to the explanation of the dependent variable (number of species or abundance) are

systematically eliminated (Younger, 1979). The relationship between epifaunal feeding habits and

CEC were analysed through regression analyses.

4.3. Results

Attendant epifaunal assemblages were numerically dominated by arthropods, accounting for

48 % and 65 % of total abundance in Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica, respectively

(Figure 4.1, top).

Molluscs were also abundant in both gorgonians (18 % in Eunicella gazella and 22 % in Lep-

togorgia lusitanica). On the other hand, the Platyhelminthes, which were exclusive of Eunicella

gazella epifaunal assemblages, were the second most abundant group. In terms of species richness

(i.e. the number of different OTUs), polychaetes were highly diverse, accounting for more than

30 % of total number of species on both gorgonians) (Figure 4.1, center). Indeed, in Eunicella

gazella assemblages, polychaetes were the richest group (34 %), followed by arthropods (31 %)

and molluscs (29 %). In Leptogorgia lusitanica colonies, arthropods were dominant, not only in

abundance but also in number of species (35 % of total number of species), followed by annelids

(33 %) and molluscs (27 %) (Figure 4.1, center).

Regarding the feeding guilds of the attendant epifaunal assemblages, in Eunicella gazella

carnivores/omnivores and suspension-feeders/deposit-feeders were the dominant feeding modes

(Figure 4.1, bottom). Epifaunal assemblages associated with Leptogorgia lusitanica colonies

presented a more evenly distribution of the main feeding guild, that is to say that, besides the

above mentioned trophic guilds, the contribution of deposit-feeders, deposit-feeders/herbivores

and suspension-feeders was also relevant.

Hurlbert’s expected number of species, which can be rarefied to the same number of individuals

(equal or lower than the maximal common number of individuals), thus allowing comparisons

of the assemblages sampled from colonies with different sizes, different surfaces available for

colonization or different gorgonian species. Most of the rarefaction curves showed relatively

steep slopes and are far from reaching the asymptotic values (species saturation) (Figure 4.2).

By comparing the patterns of the rarefaction curves constructed for the three main taxonomic

groups, it is apparent an increasing contribution of Polychaeta for biodiversity in both gorgonians,

in comparison to the higher abundance of arthropods (Figure 4.2).

(Total) and the main taxonomic groups (Arthropoda, Mollusca and Polychaeta) in Eunicella
gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica.

Correlations between gorgonian attributes and the number of taxa and abundance were per-

formed for the whole epifaunal assemblage and the main taxonomic groups separately. The cor-

relation values were consistently highly significant for the relationships between both abundance

and species richness of the attendant assemblages and functional intricacy (CEC index) in the two

gorgonian species. The correlation between species richness and indicators of colonizable surface

also showed significant values in most cases, with the highest values for height in Leptogorgia

lusitanica and for area in Eunicella gazella. Abundance showed consistently lower correlation to

the indicators of colonizable area and most values were not significant in Leptogorgia lusitanica

(Tables 4.2 and 4.3). Except for the relationship between species richness and lacunarity in

Leptogorgia lusitanica, measures of complexity showed no significant correlations to the attendant

assemblages (Tables 4.2 and 4.3).

The radar plots (Figures 4.3 and 4.4) show absolute values of the maximum Spearman correla-

tion within each category plotted on the three axes and the points are connected to present an area.

These graphs illustrate the predominance of epibiont cover in explaining richness and abundance

of epifaunal assemblages as well as the consistently higher correlations of gorgonian attributes

with species richness than with abundance (Figures 4.3 and 4.4).

These trends were incorporated into multiple linear regression models to analyse the re-

and 4.5). Again, CEC was always the variable that contributed the most for the total variability

(Tables 4.4 and 4.5). It is also noteworthy that more variables were generally kept in the final

model concerning Leptogorgia lusitanica assemblages, compared with those of Eunicella gazella

(Tables 4.4 and 4.5) for which the best fits were obtained for CEC alone or combinations of CEC

and area. Also, the significant contribution of complexity measures (D and L) were only detected

for Leptogorgia lusitanica assemblages. Significant relationships between the abundance of

individuals of the main trophic groups and CEC was found in the epifaunal assemblages associated

with both gorgonians, except for the deposit-feeders in Leptogorgia lusitanica (Figure 4.5).

4.4. Discussion

The use of different measures of habitat complexity together with different sampling methods

hampers direct comparisons of results gathered on the relationships between habitat complexity

and associated animal assemblages. Besides, measures of structural complexity can change

unpredictably across spatial scales and typical coral habitats are too complex for any single

measure of complexity (Knudby and LeDrew, 2007). In coral reef systems, overall, species diversity

of fish (Nagelkerken et al., 2000; Gratwicke and Speight, 2005a; Lingo and Szedlmayer, 2006; Wilson

et al., 2007) and epifaunal invertebrate assemblages (Vytopil and Willis, 2001; Idjadi and Edmunds,

2006) have been positively correlated with habitat complexity. In some studies, results differed

with the nature of the reef (Öhman and Rajasuriya, 1998) or were inconsistent in studied areas

(Luckhurst and Luckhurst, 1978; Bejarano et al., 2011). Other studies also reported no relationship

between species diversity and habitat complexity (Caballero and Schmitter-Soto, 2001). This

inconsistency in the results obtained may be related to the use of different measures of complexity

or the scales at which complexity was assessed, as, according to some authors (e.g. Knudby and

LeDrew, 2007), it should preferably match the typical body size of the organisms whose habitat

is being investigated. Although in the present study habitat complexity assessed by fractals was

measured at the scale of the gorgonian colony, evidence of gorgonian habitat complexity leading

to the enhancement of its attendant assemblage biodiversity was not unequivocal.

The present results demonstrate that gorgonian colony attributes affect species richness and

133



PART II. GORGONIANS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED EPIBENTHIC FAUNA

abundance of associated epifaunal assemblages in varying degrees. Moreover, this study also

support the hypothesis predicting a differential response of different taxonomic groups to gor-

gonian attributes as a result of their different environmental and or biological requisites. The

most striking pattern emerging from the results is that the colonial epibiont cover of gorgonians

is always recovered as a significant and the most relevant attribute of the gorgonian habitat for

the biodiversity and abundance of their attendant assemblages. Although multiple factors are

expected to influence epifaunal assemblage patterns associated with gorgonians, the abundance

of epibionts in each colony consistently enhanced diversity and abundance of all non-colonial

species, although size measures (area, width and/or height) were also relevant. Despite some

ascendancy of the structural complexity and heterogeneity measures in the multiple regression

analyses (but only in Leptogorgia lusitanica), the biological structural component of the habitat

was always the most relevant. This suggests that the enhancement of local diversity promoted

by gorgonians may be also indirectly supported by these organisms that settle and grow up

on the external surface of their skeletons. Associations of marine invertebrates and colonial

animals, other than corals (Harvell, 1984; Lindberg and Stanton, 1988; Conradi et al., 2000; Dauby

et al., 2001; Ribeiro et al., 2003), or even algae (Hall and Bell, 1988; Bologna and Heck Jr., 1999;

Cacabelos et al., 2010) have been frequently reported, reinforcing the need for a better knowledge

on the associations between corals and associated fauna. This possible dependency might reflect

different faunal strategies to exploit the colonial epibiont organisms. Indeed, previous studies on

the relationships between macroalgae/seagrasses and associated epifaunal assemblages reported

that epiphytes (mainly algae) play an important role in structuring the patterns of distribution

and abundance of mobile organisms (Schneider and Mann, 1991; Martin-Smith, 1993; Attrill

et al., 2000; Cacabelos et al., 2010). These organisms can increase structural complexity (Hall

and Bell, 1988; Schneider and Mann, 1991; Martin-Smith, 1993) and/or provide additional food

resources (Kitting et al., 1984; Orth and Van Montfrans, 1984; Bologna and Heck Jr., 1999; Jones

and Thornber, 2010), which will probably contribute to the maintenance of more diverse and

abundant epifaunal assemblages. According to Rotjan and Lewis (2008), concerning scleractinian

fauna, the 51 invertebrate corallivore species are in fact a small proportion of the total amount

of invertebrate fauna described as being associated with coral species (Stella et al., 2011). For

octocorals, namely gorgonians, it is also known that some gastropods feed on their hosts’ living

tissue (Patton, 1972; Burkepile and Hay, 2007; García-Matucheski and Muniain, 2010), but most

of the other invertebrate-associated fauna does not (Patton, 1972; Kumagai, 2008). On the

other hand, several amphipods, which were numerically dominant here, have been reported to

feed on algae, bryozoans and hydrozoans (Duffy and Hay, 2000; Dauby et al., 2001). During a

manipulative experiment testing the relative importance of trophic and structural characteristics

of seagrass epiphytes on macrofaunal associated organisms, Bologna and Heck Jr. (1999) found

that mobile seagrass fauna responded positively to the presence of new trophic resources, rather

than the increases in secondary structure. Only caprellids (Crustacea: Amphipoda) appeared

134



CHAPTER 4. DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF INVERTEBRATE EPIFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES ASSOCIATED WITH
GORGONIANS ARE DRIVEN BY COLONY ATTRIBUTES

to be associated with both the structure and trophic resources of epiphytes. Other authors,

however, observed that both epiphyte cover and substratum shape were relevant in determining

the distribution of epifaunal invertebrates in seagrass beds but responses were species-dependent

(Schneider and Mann, 1991). In the present study, significant, yet sometimes weak, linear

relationships were detected in both gorgonians between the abundance of the main trophic groups

and the colonial epibiont cover. These results may indicate either their role as direct food resources

or their contribution for the enhancement of additional food resources (e.g. animals for carnivores

or organically rich particles for suspension/deposit-feeders) adding to the functional intricacy of

the gorgonian habitat. Regardless the role of epibionts in structuring the epifaunal assemblages

associated with gorgonians (i.e. food resource or additional habitat), the current results support

the hypothesis predicting that gorgonians’ epibiont cover (both flora and fauna) is relevant for the

patterns of abundance and diversity of their attendant assemblages.

Despite the strong and consistent significance of epibiont cover, epifaunal abundance and

diversity were also strongly related to gorgonian attributes representing the surface available

for colonization, although not consistently between gorgonian species or across faunal groups.

This relationship depended on the host considered as well as on the faunal group analysed.

In the present study, regardless the measure used, the correlations between animal abundance

and habitat attributes was always weaker than those found for diversity, which corroborates the

findings of earlier studies (Öhman and Rajasuriya, 1998; Idjadi and Edmunds, 2006).

Taken into consideration the studies highlighting the relationship between structural com-

plexity and diversity in marine environments both for fish and invertebrates, the non significant

correlations between the fractal measure of complexity and both the number of species and

abundance of invertebrate assemblages generally found could be surprising. Although this is the

first attempt to apply fractal dimensions in estimating habitat complexity in coral colonies and to

assess its relationship with associated epifaunal assemblages, this is a common approach to plants

and algae (Morse et al., 1985; Gee and Warwick, 1994; Davenport et al., 1999; Attrill et al., 2000).

Attrill et al. (2000) while assessing the relationship between seagrass structural complexity and

the associated macroinvertebrate community found that seagrass biomass rather than complexity

was the crucial factor for the enhancement of the number of individuals and species. As no

significant positive relationship was detected between biomass and complexity, the authors linked

the increase in species diversity with increasing seagrass biomass to a species-area relationship

effect (larger surface area available for colonization). These authors proposed that the relationship

between seagrass biomass and macroinvertebrate diversity was a sampling artefact resulting from

the probability of collecting more of the rarer species as the area sampled increases. The results

of the present quantitative, statistically-based study also suggest that the patterns of diversity and

abundance of epifaunal assemblages seems to be better explained by a greater surface available for

colonization and the enhancement of additional ecological niches (and food resources) promoted

135



PART II. GORGONIANS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED EPIBENTHIC FAUNA

by other colonial organisms and algae attached to the colonies than to the structural complexity

of the colony itself. Nevertheless, if this may occur for gorgonian colonies, the paradigm that

structural complexity enhances species diversity can still be valid if tested to a broader range of

habitat complexity (e.g. by comparison to more complex coral species like scleractinians) or to

a broader spatial scale (e.g. by comparison of the reef environment or gorgonian aggregation to

other less complex habitats), as suggested for seagrass beds (Attrill et al., 2000). That is to say that

this paradigm may be scale dependent. This is supported by some studies that analyzed coral

reefs as a whole instead of focusing on the colonies themselves (Luckhurst and Luckhurst, 1978;

Chabanet et al., 1997; Gratwicke and Speight, 2005b; Wilson et al., 2007). Besides, manipulative

experiments on structural complexity using artificial reef blocks to create habitats with different

levels of complexity also provided evidence supporting the hypothesis that habitat complexity

increased the diversity of reef-fish species (Lingo and Szedlmayer, 2006). In the case of gorgonians,

apparently their importance relies on the overall environment at the aggregation scale instead of

the scale of individual colonies, which reinforces the need for the conservation of the gorgonian

aggregation areas as a whole including their size structure and taxonomical diversity. Nevertheless,

future research should attempt to compare corals of contrasting structural complexities (e.g.

gorgonians versus scleractinian) and to separate the effects of habitat complexity, food availability

and shelter in order to better assess the relationship between host attributes and associated

epifaunal assemblages.

Reproductive aspects of gorgonians in
the Algarve coast





CHAPTER5
Reproductive cycle of the gorgonian Eunicella gazella: an

originally tropical species dominating shallow Atlantic Iberian

coasts



PART III. REPRODUCTIVE ASPECTS OF GORGONIANS IN THE ALGARVE COAST

Abstract

The annual development of the reproductive structures of a shallow (16 m depth) popula-

tion of the gorgonian Eunicella gazella was found to be highly synchronized between sexes.

The sex ratio of 1.09 (F:M) was close to parity. The spermatogenic cycle took six to eight

months but the oogenic cycle was much longer, taking more than one year for mature oocytes

to develop. High fecundity was observed in females(27.30 ± 13.24 oocytes polyp?1) and males
(49.30 ± 31.14 sperm sacs polyp?1) immediately before spawning, and these values are amongst the
highest values to date in temperate gorgonians. Spawning occurred in September/October after

a period of high sea surface temperatures. Females release high numbers of large sized mature

oocytes (9.10 ± 4.60 oocytes polyp?1) but retain immature oocytes that develop only in the next
season. Fecundity was found to be correlated to polyp size but apparently not to colony size.

Broadcast spawning is proposed as reproductive mode and no evidence of surface or internal

brooding was observed. Even though common and abundant in the area, the colonies of Eunicella

gazella frequently present high damage and the reproductive strategy of the species is discussed

accordingly.

5.1. Introduction

Demography and life-history traits shape the size of populations, having a huge impact on

the persistence, decline, local extinction, and recovery of those populations. Reproduction is

the main driver of most organisms, which invest large amounts of energy on progeny (e.g. Coma

et al., 1998; Leuzinger et al., 2003; Harshman and Zera, 2007). The reproductive strategy is

species dependent (or even population dependent), being shaped by biological, ecological and

environmental factors, playing a crucial role in the population dynamics and biogeography of

marine organisms (Grosberg and Levitan, 1992; Strathmann et al., 2002). Changes in patterns

of recruitment may also have a major influence on the size of local populations (Hughes et al.,

2000; Marshall and Keough, 2006), either increasing or decreasing them, and depending on

the ecological role of the species, the effects can scale up to the community level (Grosberg

and Levitan, 1992; Teixidó et al., 2011). In a marine species, the local degree of recruitment

success depends on the stochastic variation of several environmental and biological factors, such

as direction, frequency and speed of currents, availability of space, density of predators and

phytoplankton biomass. However, the pool of recruits is governed primarily by the number of eggs

146



CHAPTER 5. REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE OF THE GORGONIAN : AN ORIGINALLY TROPICAL SPECIES DOMINATING
SHALLOW ATLANTIC IBERIAN COASTS

that can be fertilized, ultimately depending on the reproductive strategy of each species and local

constraints (Lasker and Stewart, 1992; Levitan, 1993). Therefore, aiming at maximizing offspring,

the reproductive cycle of a species integrates not only its evolutionary path (life-history) but also

local constraints, in response to selective pressure.

The Anthozoa (Cnidaria) are one of the most conspicuous faunal groups in the marine envir-

onment, comprising approximately 7500 species (Daly et al., 2007). Gorgonians (Anthozoa: Alcy-

onacea) are important habitat builders as they provide structure, thus increasing the complexity of

the system (Jones et al., 1994, 1997). They play an important ecological role in sublittoral benthic

communities, providing habitat for other fauna and increasing the diversity and biomass of the

community (Wendt et al., 1985; Cerrano et al., 2009). Their structuring role in temperate marine

shallow ecosystems is linked to their population dynamics (e.g. density and size distribution),

which are strongly influenced by reproductive aspects. The reproduction of cnidarians is diverse

and can be very complex because of the high plasticity proportioned by their simple morphology

and the lack of constraints common in higher metazoan taxa (Fautin, 2002). Even though

octocorals may have the possibility to propagate asexually (a reproductive mode that may be

highly underestimated, according to Fautin 2002), sexuality seems to be the norm in this subclass

with approximately 3000 species (Daly et al., 2007), being highly retained during the evolutionary

process (Kahng et al., 2011), similarly to what happens in scleractinian corals (Kerr et al., 2011).

Gonochorism predominates in Octocorallia and hermaphroditism is rare, in marked contrast with

hard corals (Scleractinia) where hermaphroditism is the most common type (for a review see

Kahng et al., 2011). In octocorals, the reproductive mode (mating) is plastic, with nearly half of

the species favouring broadcast spawning and the remaining being brooders (40 % internal and

11 % external) (Kahng et al., 2011). External brooding is thought to be an intermediate strategy

between broadcast spawning (the original state) and internal brooding (Kahng et al., 2011), a

strategy associated to more local dispersal (Szmant, 1986).

In species favouring sexual reproduction, gametes are necessary to ensure offspring to maintain

populations but also to provide the genetic recombination to cope with environmental change

(e.g. Coffroth and Lasker, 1998; Fautin, 2002). Therefore, gametogenesis and the traits associated

to this process play a major role in reproduction. Because gorgonians are modular organisms and

the polyp is finite in size, several traits such as the reproductive mode, number of reproductive

structures and size govern the energy investment to enhance larval survival (Hall and Hughes,

1996; Leuzinger et al., 2003; Henry and Hart, 2005). For example, in octocorals, oocytes are

generally large but oocyte size is not clearly related to sexuality, reproductive mode or polyp

fecundity (Kahng et al., 2011). However, clades within octocorals present significant differences

in oocyte size, suggesting that this trait is conserved along the evolution of these taxa (Kahng

et al., 2011). On the other hand, polyp fecundity (number of oocytes or sperm sacs) may present

significant differences at regional and local scales, reflecting differences in environmental factors

147



PART III. REPRODUCTIVE ASPECTS OF GORGONIANS IN THE ALGARVE COAST

such as temperature (e.g. Gori et al., 2007, ress; Torrents and Garrabou, 2011). Therefore, energy

allocation to reproduction is a complex task governed by internal and external factors and the

interactions between them (Marshall and Keough, 2006). Identifying the main traits and drivers

associated to the reproduction of a species is crucial for building specific models that can be used

to predict the reproductive output of a determined species in a specific area.

Marine ecosystems face several pressures worldwide, such as overfishing, coastal development,

pollution, tourism and climate change (e.g. Turner et al., 1999; Milazzo et al., 2002; Fox et al., 2003;

Watling and Auster, 2005; Halpern et al., 2008; Mora, 2008), with differential response from the

biota and complex networks of interactions between living resources and their habitats. There

is evidence that gorgonian populations are affected by natural or/and anthropogenic factors (e.g.

Coma et al., 2004; Linares et al., 2008a). Recently, it has been proven that shallow circalitoral areas

in southern Portugal are characterized by a mixed population of gorgonian species (Gonçalves

et al., 2010; Cúrdia et al., 2sub) and their conservation must be prioritized (Anonymous, 2011).

Natural and human disturbances are normally measured in terms of their effects on adult

abundances and mortality rates, while the impacts on the reproductive biology and regenerative

processes are usually ignored because they are less obvious (e.g. Hughes et al., 2000; Teixidó

et al., 2011). Damage resulting from disturbance normally implies tissue regeneration that is

energetically demanding (Linares et al., 2008a), and the allocation of energy for regeneration may

impair not only the growth of the colonies but also their reproductive output, especially in larger

colonies that sometimes are responsible for most of the reproductive output of a population (e.g.

Hall and Hughes, 1996; Kapela and Lasker, 1999). It has been proven that disturbance decreases

the reproductive output of these colonial organisms (e.g. Linares et al., 2005, 2008a; Torrents

and Garrabou, 2011; Tsounis et al., 2012) with serious effects in their population dynamics and

conservation (Tsounis et al., 2006; Linares et al., 2008b). Localized changes that affect coral

reproduction at one location may also have important effects on nearby populations because of

the strong link between benthic and larval stages (Hughes et al., 2000). In fact, small changes

in coral fecundity can result in large changes in recruitment leading to dramatic effects of large

magnitude (Hughes et al., 2000).

Management of coastal areas where ecosystem engineers are present should always take into

account the dynamics of those species, and the processes affecting the stocks of adults, namely

recruitment. Because of the importance of gorgonian species for the Mediterranean coralligenous

reefs (Bavestrello et al., 1997; Linares et al., 2005, 2007; Ballesteros, 2006), several reproductive

aspects of the most abundant gorgonian species have been addressed in the recent past (e.g.

Coma et al., 2004; Tsounis et al., 2006; Ribes et al., 2007; Linares et al., 2008a) in order to provide

baseline data and fulfil knowledge gaps. In contrast, such information is missing for common

species from the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula, such as Eunicella labiata, Eunicella

148



CHAPTER 5. REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE OF THE GORGONIAN : AN ORIGINALLY TROPICAL SPECIES DOMINATING
SHALLOW ATLANTIC IBERIAN COASTS

gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica (Cúrdia et al., 2sub). Because Eunicella gazella is one of the

most affected gorgonian species in the south Portugal (unpublished data), presenting both high

damage frequency (percentage of damaged colonies) and extension (percentage of the colony area

damaged), knowledge on the reproductive processes of this species is crucial for understanding

the life-history patterns of the species and a preliminary step towards assessing the ability of these

species to recover from disturbances. In this context, the current study aims at describing the

reproductive cycle of Eunicella gazella, a poorly studied species, namely concerning oogenesis,

spermatogenesis, fecundity and time of spawning. The reproductive aspects analysed in this study

will be discussed in terms of their importance for the distribution of the species in the context of

areas under multiple pressures.

5.2. Materials and Methods

5.2.1. Study area

The collection of samples was undertaken in Pedra da Greta, a rocky area used as fishing ground

located near Faro, southern Portugal. This rocky formation extends for nearly 3 km long, ranging

from a few metres in width to 80 m in the widest areas, and a depth range of 14–18 m. Geologically,

the elevated surface represents a fossilized ancient dunar belt that went underwater with sea-

level rising long time ago, constituting one of the largest hard-bottom areas in the eastern part

of the Algarve coast. The area is characterized by numerous small canyons running parallel and

perpendicularly to the coast creating a “giants’ causeway” bottom, with vertical relief varying from

0.3 to 4 m. Considerable topographic complexity is provided by such 3-dimensional arrangement,

resulting in numerous small holes, caves and overhangs that provide refuge for a large number

of species, including several commercially important species. Professional fishermen use a wide

variety of fishing gears in this reef (e.g. trammel nets and gill nets, hook lines, pots and cages,

jiggling) but recreational fishermen also use this area, especially during summer. This constant

fishing activity results in large quantities of lost fishing gears in the bottom, but also in direct

damage to gorgonian colonies. Damaged colonies are very frequent in this area, presenting

extensive partial mortality, overgrowth and/or signs of breaking (many times loosing more than

half of the colony).

5.2.2. Sampling

Samples were collected monthly from July 2009 to July 2010. Winter months (November to

February) were characterized by frequent periods of bad weather that did not allow sampling in

149



PART III. REPRODUCTIVE ASPECTS OF GORGONIANS IN THE ALGARVE COAST

two dates, November 2009 and February 2010. At each sampling period, fragments of the apical

part of 30 colonies of Eunicella gazella were collected by SCUBA diving, selecting colonies that

were not extensively damaged and without clear signs of faunal overgrowth. The maximum height

(nearest cm) of each sampled colony was recorded. Biological material was preserved in 10 %

buffered formalin until further analyses.

5.2.3. Reproductive cycle and fecundity

Although the term “gonads” has been widely used in scientific publications regarding anthozo-

ans, according to Fautin and Mariscal (1991) the so-called gonads are simply gametogenic areas

of the mesenteries. The equivalence of each individual oocyte (or spermary) to a single gonad

in order to quantify fecundity and other reproductive parameters should be avoided in future

contributions. The term “reproductive structures” is used in those cases where no special reference

is made to one of the sexes.

The oogenic cycle was studied over a 13 month period, with 11 sampling periods (mentioned

above). For the spermatogenic cycle, 6 time periods ( July, September and October 2009; January,

April and July 2010) were analysed. For both sexes, a total of 5 colonies was analysed at each

sampling date. Spicules were de-calcified using a 10 % formic acid solution diluted with 4 %

formalin. For each colony, 10 randomly chosen polyps, located at 1–5 cm of the branch tip

were dissected under a stereo microscope. For each polyp, reproductive structures (oocytes or

spermaries) were counted under the stereo microscope at full magnification (50×). The polyp
content was then placed on a microscope slide with a drop of 10 % lactic acid and covered with

a cover slip. The preparation was observed only 24 h after this procedure to allow the lactic

acid to degrade the tissues, thus making easier the detection and identification of the oocytes or

spermaries. The maximum and minimum diameters of all reproductive structures were measured

with an eyepiece micrometer.

Oocytes and spermaries were spherical or ellipsoidal in shape, therefore the equivalent dia-

meter of the ellipse (D ) was estimated using the formula:

D = AB
3(a + b) ?

p
(3a + b) × (a + 3b)

where A is the maximum diameter; B is the minimum diameter; a is A2 and b is
B
2 .

The volume of each oocyte or spermary was estimated using the formula:

V = 0.75?× (0.5D )3

150



CHAPTER 5. REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE OF THE GORGONIAN : AN ORIGINALLY TROPICAL SPECIES DOMINATING
SHALLOW ATLANTIC IBERIAN COASTS

where V is the volume of oocyte or spermary and D is its equivalent diameter. Finally, the volume

of oocytes or spermaries per polyp was calculated as the sum of the volume of the oocytes or

spermaries.

Development of reproductive structures in both sexes was also analysed using histological

techniques. Before processing tissue samples for histology, gorgonian spicules were de-calcified

using a solution of 10% formic acid in 4% buffered formalin and the axis of the colonies was

carefully removed with fine pointed tongs. Small pieces of tissue were dehydrated in a graded

ethanol series and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections of 10 µm thickness were cut in a

microtome and left to dry in the oven at 37 ?C for at least 48 h. Histological cuts were stained using
the Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) method (Kiernan, 1990).

In this study, fecundity is defined as the number of oocytes (or spermaries) in a polyp over

a reproductive season, following the recommendations of Llodra (2002) to obtain the maximum

information of the data analysed.

5.2.4. Environmental data

Monthly data on sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll a, photosynthetically available

radiation (PAR) and particulate organic carbon (POC) during the study period were used for

correlations with the gametogenic cycle. Data on SST was gathered from the oceanographic buoy

located at ? 2 nautical miles from the study area (www.hidrografico.pt/boias-ondografo.php).
Chlorophyll a concentrations, PAR and POC were derived from satellite remote sensing data,

collected from the Giovanni online data system (MODIS-Aqua 4 km, monthly processed data,

available at http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/overview/index.html), developed and main-

tained by the NASA Goddard Environmental Sciences Data and Information Services Center - GES

DISC (Acker and Leptoukh, 2007). Chlorophyll a and POC data are used as proxies for primary

production (phytoplankton) and secondary production (zooplankton).

5.2.5. Statistical analyses

The sex ratio was compared with parity (1F:1M) using the ?2 test (Wilson and Hardy, 2002).

The non parametric Kruskal-Wallis’ U test was employed to compare colony size, the number of

reproductive structures per polyp, volume of oocytes or spermaries and polyp equivalent diameter

between sampling periods. Multivariate comparison tests were performed whenever significant

differences were detected.

In some monthly sampling periods, the size-frequency distribution of oocyte diameters (equi-

valent diameter of ellipse) presented two modes. In order to separate the two components of

the mixed distribution, the method described by Macdonald and Green (1988) was used. This

method employs grouped data to find the best fit for component distributions to histogram data

(in this case comparing a single mode against two modes), using chi-squared approximation to

the likelihood ratio test. We used mixdist (Macdonald and Green, 1988), using grouped data (size

classes of 20 µm) to calculate the parameter values (?, relative percentage; µ, mean; ?, standard

deviation) and their standard errors for each component distribution. The program returns a chi-

square value for the fit between calculated and empirical histograms. Log-normal distributions

were used as they presented better fits and because in the absence of bi-modality, the distribution

of data follows the log-normal model.

Regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between colony size, fecundity and

volume of reproductive structures in both sexes. The effect of polyp size on fecundity and oocyte

volume was also analysed using regression analysis at two different periods (May-June and July-

August, with grouped data to increase statistical power). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was

employed to test the effect of colony size on these correlations (Bingham and Fry, 2010).

All analyses were performed in the open source statistical software R v2.14.1. (R Development

Core Team, 2010), with statistical significance set for p &amp;lt;0.05.

5.3. Results

5.3.1. General features and sex ratio

In general, all fertile polyps from a colony exhibited reproductive structures of the same sex

(gonochoristic). However, one colony from June 2010 identified as female in the stereo microscope,

presented both oocytes and small spermaries (hermaphroditic). Within this hermaphroditic

colony, all individual polyps analysed (n=10) presented both sperm sacs and oocytes. This colony

was not considered for estimating the number of reproductive structures per polyp, their volume

and size frequency distribution. Although the sexes are separate, colonies lacked any obvious

secondary sexual character and the reproductive structures are the only indications of gender. The

sex ratio was 1.09 (?2 = 0.268, p = 0.604), not deviating significantly from parity (1F:1M).

Medium and large-sized oocytes (?150 µm) are visible under the stereo microscope (50×
magnification) and tend to form small aggregates composed by a few different sized cells growing

from the mesenteries. When observed under the microscope (Figure 5.1), these aggregates are

dominated by small-sized cells that are mostly overlooked in the stereo microscope. Those small-

sized cells correspond to pre-vitelogenic cells (80–160 µm diameter) and are characterized by clear

cytoplasm and a large nucleus with two evident nucleoli and are basophilic. Oocytes larger than

250 µm diameter presented a thick cytoplasmic membrane (5–10 µm), yellow opaque colour and

were granulated in texture. Histologically, these eosinophilous cells correspond to vitelogenic and

mature oocytes (Figure 5.3). The cytoplasmic membrane of some of the large oocytes was easily

damaged during manipulation, resulting in abundant lipidic droplets in the disrupted area.

Concerning males, gastrodermis surrounding the reproductive structures over the mesentery

clearly decreases during gametogenesis, being abundant and clearly identifiable in the first stages

and almost absent in ripe spermaries (Figure 5.2). With experience, it was possible to distinguish

the gastrodermis of male from that of female colonies, based on the morphology and development.

Smaller sperm sacs (25–130 µm) are ellipsoid in shape and present a thin layer of tissue surround-

ing several large and slightly irregularly shaped spermatogonia. Sperm sacs with 140–300 µm

present a thick layer of tissue (5–10 µm) surrounding large numbers of spermatocytes, which are

identifiable in the microscope even without processing the material for histology. Larger sperm

sacs normally do not present gastrodermis tissue in their surroundings (Figure 5.2), are opaque and

with a darker colouration, but cells cannot be differentiated without processing the material for

histology. Large sperm sacs in samples of August 2009 were dominated by spermatocytes, whereas

sperm sacs of equivalent dimensions in samples of September and October 2009 presented mostly

spermatozoa and a few spermatocytes. When fully developed, the larger sperm sacs are quite

irregular in shape and very easily disrupted.

5.3.2. Annual cycle of oocyte development

Oocytes developed attached to the mesenteries by a short mesogleal stalk at the base of each

polyp. Formation of new oocytes was not synchronous and took place over a six to seven month

period (February-March until September-October) (Figures 5.4 and 5.6). The newly formed oo-

cytes (80–160 µm diameter) remained at approximately the same size until January of the following

year (Figure 5.6). Between March and May, the previous year’s cohort of oocytes increased up

to 300 µm in average diameter (Figure 5.6). From June to September these oocytes continued to

mature, increasing their size and volume, and reaching maximum values in September (?500 µm)
(Figures 5.5 and 5.6 and Table 5.1). In October, these large oocytes were released and the size-

frequency distribution is almost entirely composed by the new oocytes produced in the current

season (Figure 5.6 and Table 5.1). This pattern was also evident in the mean volume of oocytes per

polyp, which increased markedly from March to June and July to September (Figure 5.5).

5.3.3. Annual cycle of spermaries development

In January, 90 % of the polyps presented reproductive structures, but the number of spermaries

per polyp was very low and their volume was extremely reduced (Figures 5.7 and 5.8 and Table 5.2).

From January to September, spermary number and volume increased sharply. In September,

spermaries were ripe and very abundant (14–159, mean of 49.3 spermaries per polyp). In October,

the number of spermaries declined sharply coincident with the end of spermatogenesis and

gamete release, but volume was still high because of some large spermaries present in many

polyps.

These results were confirmed by the size-frequency distribution of the sperm sacs diameter.

In January, newly developed small-sized structures (20–120 µm in diameter) were predominant in

the size-frequency distribution. The development of those spermaries was evident in April and

July, as distributions showed progressively longer tails to the right and lower contribution of new

structures (Figure 5.9). The production of new spermaries was halted between July and September

(similar number of sperm sacs per polyp). In September, the size distribution of sperm sacs was

mesokurtic, with slight negative skewness and a large range of diameters (20–624 µm), but a very

low contribution of small-sized sperm sacs (20–120 µm representing less than 20 %). In October,

the release of spermatozoa produced a negatively skewed distribution with a narrower range of

sizes. Spermatogenesis took between eight and ten months to complete, and thus was much

shorter than oogenesis.

5.3.4. Fecundity

From the oogenic cycle it was observed that mature oocytes (greater than 350 µm) were

spawned by late September/October. The mean number of mature oocytes per polyp in September

was 9.1±4.60 (SD). Considering that the mean number of polyps in a terminal branch is 27.5 cm?1,
the estimated number of mature oocytes per cm of Eunicella gazella in the studied area is

roughly 250. The size of mature spermaries is more difficult to estimate since, histologically,

spermatozoa were observed in spermaries presenting a wide size range. However, considering

the size-frequency distribution of spermaries in September and October, it is expectable that

in September sperm sacs greater than 300 µm are mature, resulting in 18.8 ± 11.81 sperm sacs
per polyp and ? 520 mature male reproductive structures per cm of Eunicella gazella, i.e. more
than twice the number of mature oocytes. Nevertheless, male fecundity estimates are most likely

underestimated as the limit of 300 µm is probably too conservative.

5.3.5. Effects of colony and polyp size on fecundity

Colony size of the analysed female gorgonians presented some variation throughout the study

period (Kruskal-Wallis’ U test: ?29 = 121.74, p &amp;lt;2.2e?16), with lower values in July 2009 and June,
January and March 2010 (multiple comparisons, p &amp;lt;0.001). This was also observed for males
(U test, ?24 = 37.84, p = 1.11e?7), with July 2010 presenting larger colonies (multiple comparisons,
p &amp;lt;0.001). For each sampling date and for both sexes, the variation in the number of reproductive
structures and their volume within each colony was greater than the variation between colonies.

It was not detected an evident effect of colony size on the number of oocytes and spermaries and

their volume. The size frequency distribution of oocytes or spermaries was not different between

colonies of different sizes.

The equivalent diameter of polyps (proxy for polyp size) ranged from 580 to 1373 µm in females

and 598 to 1433 µm in males. In August 2009, females presented larger polyps than in the remaining

sampling dates (U test: ?26 = 53.76, p = 8.23e?10). Nevertheless, the variation in polyp size was
larger within individual colonies than between colonies. Significant positive linear correlations

between polyp size and the number of oocytes were observed for two sets of samples (May-June

and July-August) when production of new reproductive structures and maturation of pre-season

oocytes was extremely active. However, these positive trends differed between dates: in May-

June the effect of polyp size was lower (y = ?1.713 + 0.0163x ) and less evident (r 2 = 0.217, F(1,98) =
27.16, p &amp;lt;0.001) than in July-August (y = ?28.8421 + 0.0475x ; r 2 = 0.603, F(1,148) = 224.3, p &amp;lt;0.001).
These trends were not dependent on colony size (ANCOVA, p &gt; 0.05). However, oocyte volume was
better predicted using a linear model with polyp size and colony size as predictors. In May-June

(r 2 = 0.538, F(2,97) = 56.43, p &amp;lt;0.001) the effects of polyp size (? = 2.94e?4, t(97) = 8.895, p &amp;lt;0.001)
and height (? = ?3.27e?3, t(97) = ?2.716, p &amp;lt;0.01) were significant. Similarly, in July-August, the
multiple regression model y = ?0.399+4.376e?4 polyp size+3.764e?3 height (r 2 = 0.4162, F(2,147) =
52.4, p &amp;lt;0.001) indicated polyp size (t(147) = 9.638, p &amp;lt;0.001) and colony height (t(147) = 2.597, p&amp;lt;

163



PART III. REPRODUCTIVE ASPECTS OF GORGONIANS IN THE ALGARVE COAST

0.05) as suitable predictors of the volume of oocytes. The size frequency distribution of oocytes

and spermaries of different polyp size classes did not present significant differences, a pattern that

was consistent along the sampling period.

5.3.6. Spawning and larval development

Sea surface temperature (SST) presented marked seasonality, with lower temperatures during

winter (December to March: 14 to 17 ?C) and a relatively large period with high SST during
summer ( June-October: 20 to 26 ?C) (Figure 5.10). Chlorophyll a, used as proxy of phytoplankton,
displayed the regular pattern for temperate waters, with a spring bloom (March-April) and a

shorter secondary peak in autumn, presenting a high correlation with POC (r = 0.894, t22 =
9.36, p &amp;lt;0.001). Radiation available for photosynthesis (PAR) was lower during winter (November-
February).

Spawning was not observed in situ at any sampling period, but in September and October, small

plumes of white milky substance were observed leaving the polyps when colonies were slightly

squeezed. This phenomenon was not observed in all sampled colonies nor during other sampling

periods. We hypothesize that these plumes were formed by spermatozoa because: 1) only a

fraction of the colonies showed this behaviour; 2) the relatively large amount of substance leaving

the polyps; 3) it was impossible to ascertain individual structures underwater (poor resolution as

a result of their small size).

Production of new oocytes or spermaries and development of pre-season oocytes was more

evident from May to September, coinciding with increasing SST. Ripening of female and male

reproductive structures was highly synchronous, converging in August-September. In October,

with decreasing SST, fecundity was significantly lower in both sexes (sperm sacs were reduced

tenfold, Table 5.2) and mature reproductive structures were rare, indicating synchronous gamete

release between sexes. Significant positive correlations between SST and both the number of

mature oocytes (?300 µm; r = 0.82, t11 = 4.75, p = 0.006) and oocyte volume (r = 0.81, t11 =
4.65, p = 0.0007) were registered. Both variables showed maximum values five to seven months
after the highest concentrations of POC (lagged correlations; r t?6 = 0.69 for mature oocytes and
r t?7 = 0.66 for oocyte volume). A peak in POC (and chlorophyll a occurred about two months after
spawning (November-December).

Structures resembling gorgonian larvae were never observed inside polyps of either female

or male colonies. The maturation of fertilized eggs occurring in mucus material adhering to

the surface of gorgonians (“brooding” Coma et al., 1995) was never observed during sampling

or elsewhere in southern Portugal. Furthermore, larvae crawling on parent colonies or nearby

sampled colonies were also never observed.

5.3.7. Loss of information on number and volume of reproductive structures

The number of oocytes counted under the stereo microscope predicted significantly the num-

ber of oocytes (y = 4.442 + 1.175x , t(400) = 40.84, p &amp;lt;0.001) as well as a significant part of the
variance (r 2 = 0.81, F(1,400) = 1668, p &amp;lt;0.001). This trend was independent of the sampling date
(ANCOVA, p &gt; 0.05). The same pattern was observed for male colonies (y = 4.182 + 1.537x , t(191) =
6.402, p &amp;lt;0.001; r 2 = 0.926, F(1,191) = 2405, p &amp;lt;0.001) although the slope was significantly lower in
September 2009 (y = 2.298 + 1.231x , t(38) = 6.402, p &amp;lt;0.001; r 2 = 0.964, F(1,38) = 1059, p &amp;lt;0.001).

5.4. Discussion

5.4.1. Sex ratio

The present study showed that Eunicella gazella is an iteroparous species with an annual

reproductive cycle like several other temperate gorgonians, such as Eunicella singularis (Gori et al.,

2007, ress; Ribes et al., 2007), Eunicella verrucosa (Munro, 2004), Leptogorgia sarmentosa (Rossi

and Gili, 2009) and Paramuricea clavata (Coma et al., 1995; Gori et al., 2007). The observed sex

ratio, not deviating significantly from parity, is similar to that reported for most species already

studied (e.g. Coma et al., 1995; Orejas et al., 2002; Tsounis et al., 2006; Ribes et al., 2007). This

pattern of balanced sex ratio is in accordance with optimal resource allocation in populations

with random mating. However, biased sex ratios have been documented, both for females (e.g.

Coffroth and Lasker, 1998; Ben-Yosef and Benayahu, 1999; Gori et al., 2007; Excoffon et al., 2011)

or males (e.g. Brazeau and Lasker, 1992; Cerrano et al., 2005; Gori et al., 2007) (see also Table 5.3).

Male biased sex ratios are supposed to increase fertilization success in gorgonians with brooding

behavior (Benayahu and Loya, 1984b), by reducing sperm limitation effects (Levitan, 1993; Kahng

et al., 2011). Because several octocoral species present oocytes all year round they are more likely

to be identified, and this was suggested to be one of the reasons why female biased sex ratios in

octocorals are quite common in the literature (Kahng et al., 2011).

5.4.2. Fecundity

Eunicella gazella presented large mature oocytes (Table 5.4). The observed values are slightly

lower than those displayed by the internal brooder Eunicella singularis, but higher than those

166

SHALLOW ATLANTIC IBERIAN COASTS

reported for the broadcast spawner Eunicella verrucosa (Table 5.4). Even though large oocyte sizes

(usually ?600 µm) are usually found in species with internal fertilisation and brooding incubation
mode (Orejas et al., 2002, and references therein), a recent review on the reproduction of octocorals

found no relationship between oocyte size and reproduction mode; yet, species with extended

oogenesis (over one year) have substantially larger oocytes than species with shorter oogenesis

(Kahng et al., 2011). On the other hand, the fecundity of Eunicella gazella (number of mature

oocytes per polyp) is within the highest values for the gorgonian species studied (Coma et al., 1995;

Kahng et al., 2011; Torrents and Garrabou, 2011). Within the genus Eunicella, this is the highest

fecundity ever reported, namely for Eunicella singularis (0.7–2.9 oocytes polyp?1, Gori et al., 2007;

Ribes et al., 2007) and Eunicella verrucosa (3.21–3.38 oocytes polyp?1, Munro, 2004). Although

sperm density may limit gorgonian reproductive success, it is the number of eggs produced that

sets the upper limit for reproductive success (Beiring and Lasker, 2000).

Many factors have the potential to affect the fecundity of gorgonians, namely reproductive

season (multiple spawnings or a seasonal mass event), depth, colony size and polyp position

within the colony (e.g. Coma et al., 1995; Kapela and Lasker, 1999; Beiring and Lasker, 2000;

Orejas et al., 2002). Due to their body morphology, polyp size is space-limited in gorgonians,

and may limit gamete production (Coma and Lasker, 1997) as suggested for corals (Benayahu

and Loya, 1984a). The current findings not only reinforce this idea, as there was a significant

positive correlation between polyp size and fecundity in female colonies, but further suggest that

the use of available space is optimized during the oogenic and spermatogenic cycles. In fact, when

reproductive structures are at the final stages of maturation (August-September), the polyp cavity

was completely occupied and the polyps presented a turgid appearance, in both male and female

colonies. Moreover, new oocytes and sperm sacs develop beside or underneath older ones, thus

achieving maximal space occupation. In Eunicella gazella, this is particularly important because

the size of reproductive structures is relatively large considering its high fecundity.

The number of spermaries was 2-3 times higher of that of females, which corroborates previous

studies on gorgonians (Coma et al., 1995; Tsounis et al., 2006; Ribes et al., 2007; Torrents and

Garrabou, 2011), and may be related to the larger mean size of oocytes, or to other factors such

as energy investment (Torrents and Garrabou, 2011). However, when reproductive structures are

mature (September), estimates of their volume per polyp for females and males are not only similar

between sexes, but also to those reported for other gorgonians (Tables 5.3 and 5.4). The volume of

the reproductive structures within a species is related to fecundity, which may present spatial and

depth related differences (e.g. Tsounis et al., 2006; Gori et al., 2007, ress; Torrents and Garrabou,

2011, see Tables 5.3 and 5.4). Volume in female and male colonies is similar during the maturation

period in July-September, increasing fourfold (e.g. 3.9–16.7 mm3, for 50 female polyps). However,

after spawning in October, the volume decreased tenfold in females (1.6 mm3, 50 polyps) and

thirtyfold in males (0.5 mm3, 50 polyps). This difference between sexes is because females retain

PART III. REPRODUCTIVE ASPECTS OF GORGONIANS IN THE ALGARVE COAST

small oocytes for the next reproductive season.

In general, fecundity increases with colony size in octocorals (e.g. Benayahu and Loya, 1984a;

Coma et al., 1995; Kapela and Lasker, 1999), and within a population large colonies sometimes

contribute disproportionately to egg production (Coma et al., 1995; Beiring and Lasker, 2000).

Increasing fecundity with size may result from an increased number of polyps per colony, as well

as an increase in the reproductive output at the polyp level (Beiring and Lasker, 2000), possibly as

a consequence of a shift in resource allocation from growth to reproduction once the colony has

reached a size-refuge threshold (Beiring and Lasker, 2000). Colony size effect was not verified in

the present work, but sampling variation may be masking this effect. Therefore, further studies

with appropriate replication, performed in a narrow period of time but comprising a broad range

of colony sizes should clarify if the observed pattern was biased due to sampling. In the present

study, a positive relationship between fecundity and polyp size was observed at all sampling

periods, suggesting that variability in polyp size may be responsible for considerable variation

in fecundity, especially considering that the apical position within the colony was fixed, thus

removing one source of error associated to differences in fecundity within octocoral species. For

some coral species, polyp volume in medium and large sized colonies is similar, even though

large colonies have more polyps (Sakai, 1998). A recent study with Astroides calycularis reported a

logarithmic relationship between the number of polyps and both colony length and width, but a

linear relationship with colony area and mass (Goffredo et al., 2011). In addition, large colonies

had polyps with smaller size than small and medium colonies, due to an over-representation

of the size class containing sexually mature polyps, suggesting that large colonies may invest

energetic resources to increase the size of young polyps up to the size at sexual maturity, rather

than increasing the size of already mature polyps (Goffredo et al., 2011). This agrees with the size

threshold that may lead to differences in energy allocation from growth to reproduction (Sakai,

1998). Indeed, energy investment in reproductive tissue increases in corals with larger polyps, but

the gonadosomatic index decreases, suggesting polyp size constraints (Sakai, 1998). This change in

energy allocation from growth-dominated to reproduction-dominated with increasing colony size,

is based on the assumption that reproduction comes at the expense of growth, so it is possible that

age and not colony height would be a better correlate with polyp fecundity (Pakes and Woollacott,

2008).

In corals, large-scale spatial and temporal variation in recruitment is clearly linked to patterns

of variation in fecundity rather than adult abundance (Hughes et al., 2000). However, a negative

correlation between polyp fecundity and population density has been suggested for benthic

cnidarians (Orejas et al., 2002). The present study was conducted in a area where Eunicella

gazella is very frequent and dominant in terms of density (13.2 colonies/5m2) (Cúrdia et al.,

2sub), although presenting high fecundity. Additional studies in contrasting density levels shall

provide further insights on this subject. The present study showed that Eunicella gazella favours

170



CHAPTER 5. REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE OF THE GORGONIAN : AN ORIGINALLY TROPICAL SPECIES DOMINATING
SHALLOW ATLANTIC IBERIAN COASTS

a reproductive strategy with high number of relatively large oocytes and synchronized spawning

to ensure that oocytes are fertilized (probably in the area), which also provides a relatively high

dispersal potential (large oocytes) to colonize adjacent areas with lower density or under lower

competitive pressure. In fact, it has been proved that coral larvae are distributed relatively

uniformly among adjacent reefs, but do not undergo larger-scale movements, resulting in modest

gene-flow in spawning corals (Hughes et al., 2000). Eunicella gazella is original from tropical

areas but, apparently, expanded recently its distribution to northern latitudes probably because

of favourable conditions under a global warming scenario. The broadcast spawning behaviour of

this species, contrasts with the brooding behaviour of Eunicella singularis and Eunicella cavolinii,

the most common Eunicella species in the Mediterranean, and seems to be efficient, as Eunicella

gazella is frequent and density dominant in southern Portugal (Cúrdia et al., 2sub). Moreover,

the populations present numerous small sized colonies (Cúrdia et al., 2sub), suggesting that

recruitment events are frequent and successful. In contrast, Eunicella singularis is extremely rare

and Eunicella cavolinii has never been found in southern Portugal, whereas the broadcast spawner

Eunicella verrucosa (Munro, 2004), has been recently reported to be expanding its distribution in

the Mediterranean (Sartoretto and Francour, 2012) and is frequent in southern Portugal (Cúrdia

et al., 2sub). Differences in spawning mode may alter fertilization and recruitment success of

gorgonian species and consequently constrain population dynamics. To what level, under the

complex variety of factors acting on coastal areas, one mode is more successful than the other

remains an important but decisive question yet to be fully addressed.

5.4.3. Spawning

The longer duration of oogenesis compared to spermatogenesis, is a common feature of the

reproductive development in gorgonians (Coma et al., 1995; Tsounis et al., 2006; Ribes et al.,

2007; Gori et al., ress), but also the general pattern for octocorals (Benayahu and Loya, 1984a),

alcyonaceans and many scleractinians (Szmant, 1986). Several octocoral species keep immature

oocytes year-round, with a fraction maturing during a seasonal oogenic cycle, as for instance

Acabaria biserialis (Ben-Yosef and Benayahu, 1999), Eunicella singularis, (Ribes et al., 2007; Gori

et al., ress) and Tripalea clavaria, (Excoffon et al., 2004, 2011). This pattern is consistent with

the theory that oogenesis is more energetically expensive than spermatogenesis (Kahng et al.,

2011). On the other hand, in order to achieve synchronous spawning in both sexes, and thus to

minimize the loss of gametes (Grosberg and Levitan, 1992; Lasker and Kim, 1996; Carlon, 1999;

Ritson-Williams et al., 2009), spermatogenesis has to be delayed (Coma et al., 1995; Tsounis et al.,

2006; Gori et al., 2007, ress). The fact that spermatogenesis took longer than commonly found in

other octocorals may be because the quantification of spermaries was undertaken in a microscope,

instead of a stereo microscope. High fecundity and volume of reproductive structures in both sexes

suggests that Eunicella gazella invests a lot of energy on sexual reproduction, a common strategy

171



PART III. REPRODUCTIVE ASPECTS OF GORGONIANS IN THE ALGARVE COAST

in other gorgonian species (Coma et al., 1995, 1998; Ribes et al., 2007; Linares et al., 2008a; Gori

et al., ress; Tsounis et al., 2012). Energy investment (i.e. volume of oocytes or spermaries) seems

to be similar in both sexes, but males produce more structures. Therefore, it is possible that by

increasing the production of male gametes, Eunicella gazella is enhancing fertilization likelihood,

as pointed by Coma et al. (1995) for Paramuricea clavata. The maximum size of mature oocytes is

similar to those reported for other gorgonian species. Considering the high fecundity registered,

the investment in large oocytes (increasing longevity and allowing energy reserves for the zygote)

may be a strategy to improve fertilization success through increased sperm-egg encounter rates

(Levitan, 1993), favouring broadcasting mode.

The investment in offspring is generally related to environmental conditions, being larger in less

stable regions (e.g. temperate waters). Some studies mentioned that several gorgonians require a

peak summer temperature above a certain threshold as a cue for spawning (Coma et al., 1995;

Gori et al., 2007; Pakes and Woollacott, 2008; De Putron and Ryland, 2009) and that temperature

is the main factor synchronizing the development of reproductive structures (Gori et al., 2007).

Long-lived species with slow oocyte development, such as octocorals, in areas with marked but

predictable seasonal variation in food availability, tend to present gametogenic cycles that follow

such variations (Coma et al., 1998; Gori et al., 2007, ress; Ribes et al., 2007, and references therein).

Spatial and depth differences in the timing of spawning of gorgonian species have been attributed

to differences in sea surface temperature, which may also be the reason why the spawning in

Eunicella gazella is delayed compared to Eunicella singularis in the Mediterranean (Gori et al.,

2007; Ribes et al., 2007) and Eunicella verrucosa in the United Kingdom (Munro, 2004). Even

though the feeding habits of this species are unknown, temperate gorgonians feed mainly on

zooplankton (copepods and nauplii) and POM (Coma et al., 1994; Ribes et al., 2003; Tsounis et al.,

2005). For example, in the Mediterranean, Paramuricea clavata shows higher energy allocation for

reproduction in March-June, when ingestion rates coupled with the spring bloom are higher, but

also presents increased feeding rates in November-December during the shorter autumn bloom

(Coma et al., 1998). The energy surplus during periods of high food availability (winter and spring)

are invested in secondary production (Coma et al., 1998). Similar models have been proposed for

other gorgonian species feeding primarily on microzooplankton and POM (Ribes et al., 2007; Gori

et al., 2007, ress). Therefore, it is expectable that the reproductive cycle of Eunicella gazella should

also be regulated by food availability. After the spring bloom (March-April), Eunicella gazella

transfers the energy surplus to the intensive production and maturation of oocytes and spermaries,

enhanced by the high summer temperatures, ending the cycle with the synchronised spawning

by female and male colonies in September-October. The occurrence of a second phytoplankton

bloom, and the frequent upwelling conditions, provide a relatively prolonged period of increased

chlorophyll a and POC concentrations during autumn-winter. The fact that spawning occurs

immediately before this period of increased food availability suggests that this energetic surplus

is crucial in the reproductive strategy of this species. Feeding and energetic studies may help to

172



CHAPTER 5. REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE OF THE GORGONIAN : AN ORIGINALLY TROPICAL SPECIES DOMINATING
SHALLOW ATLANTIC IBERIAN COASTS

discern how Eunicella gazella uses the autumn bloom. According to the present study, production

of new oocytes is not increased and sperm sacs are vestigial during this period, and the small

oocytes that were kept after spawning do not show signs of continuous maturation. The planulae

of gorgonians with broadcast spawning usually take 4 to 15 days to settle (Table 3; Linares et al.,

2008, and references therein), therefore increased food in autumn can be used by the recruits to

enhance the initial phase after settlement.

5.4.4. Conservation issues and knowledge gaps

A trade-off between regeneration and reproduction has been reported for different coral species

(Szmant, 1990; Van Veghel and Bak, 1994; Rinkevich, 1996; Ward et al., 2000), namely gorgonians

(Linares et al., 2008a; Tsounis et al., 2012). Fecundity may be reduced in damaged parts of the

colony, but can also be extended far from the damaged area (Linares et al., 2008a). As a result,

besides their immediate impacts, disturbance events may also present delayed effects on the

reproductive output of gorgonian species, therefore, affecting their long-term recovery (Tsounis

et al., 2006, 2012; Linares et al., 2008a). The samples analysed in the present study were collected

in an area under high fishing pressure (Cúrdia et al., 2sub) and a significant part of Eunicella gazella

population presents tissue damage and consequent fouling by other biota (unpublished data).

However, colonies presenting signs of damage or extensive fouling were not collected, in order

to avoid introducing bias in this study on the reproductive cycle. Nevertheless, it is important to

compare the present data with that obtained in areas without or under lower pressure that can

affect this gorgonian species. Moreover, the correlation between damage and fecundity should be

analysed in colonies from the same population, under similar environmental conditions. Spatial

and temporal variations in fecundity should also be estimated for the area.

In the near future, the present study shall be complemented with studies performed during the

spawning period, with short intervals between samples, aiming to confirm the broadcasting beha-

viour and test the existence (and frequency) of brooding in this species. In addition, researchers

should develop specific sampling techniques to allow identifying larvae on/or in the vicinity of

colonies. The use of specifically designed collectors can also shed light on the type of spawning.

Recruitment studies are also of utmost importance to understand how the larval supply is used in

the area, and what are the consequences for the dynamics, gene flow, and ultimately persistence

of the species along time. The present data disclosed the general reproductive cycle of Eunicella

gazella, providing baseline information for future studies focusing directly or indirectly on the

reproduction of this habitat engineering long-lived suspension feeder.

PART IV. HUMAN PRESSURES IN THE ALGARVE SUBLITTORAL ROCKY BOTTOMS

Abstract

In south Portugal, scuba diving is growing, following the worldwide pattern. The preference

of scuba divers for natural rocky areas with diverse fauna put these habitats under threat. The

assessment of the impacts and their causes is therefore an important issue for the management of

coastal areas, particularly if they face multiple uses. In 2005-2007, during the summer season when

scuba diving is more intense, 105 scuba divers were monitored while diving. Their behaviours, the

consequences of their actions and the associated impacts were recorded to estimate the impact of

scuba divers in the habitat. Most of the scuba divers (88.6 %) showed behaviours that may impact

marine systems and the mean contact rate was 0.340 ± 0.028 contacts min?1. The rate was higher
in scuba divers with moderate experience, and in the initial part of the dive (0–10 min). Contacts

with fins and hands dominated, mainly resulting in sediment re-suspension, but the estimated

impacts associated were generally low. However, fauna was also affected by physical damage and

interactions, which may severely impact animals, especially suspension feeding sensitive species

such as gorgonians. Based on the observed patterns, some ideas are discussed in order to reduce

scuba diving impacts at local and global scales.

Keywords: Scuba diving • impact • diver’s experience • natural versus artificial habitats

6.1. Introduction

Scuba diving is a growing activity worldwide (Davis and Tisdell, 1995; Harriott et al., 1997;

Barker and Roberts, 2004; Davenport and Davenport, 2006). Mainland Portugal has attractive

conditions for the development of this recreational activity, especially in its southern coast, the

Algarve, that showed in the recent years a sharp increase in the number of dives, certified divers

and scuba diving centres (Santos et al., 2006). The Algarve region presents an offer of tourism-

related products of excellence and natural conditions for sport tourism, and therefore in the near

future the activity is expected to grow (Santos et al., 2006) as the local authorities are fostering

the diversification of tourism products, especially expanding activities that can be certified as

“environmentally friendly” and sustainable (Correia and Pires, 2006; Pires, 2008).

Scuba divers prefer and are willing to pay more to dive in sites with high biological diversity,

high abundance of certain species (mainly fish) and high probability to observe large animals

(Rudd and Tupper, 2002; Green and Donnelly, 2003; Dearden et al., 2007). In this context, habitats

with complex biological communities, significant ecological importance and a strong contribution

for marine biodiversity such as rocky areas in tempered waters, especially in marine protected

184



CHAPTER 6. SCUBA DIVERS’ PROFILE AND THEIR IMPACTS ON THE BENTHIC ENVIRONMENT: A CONTRIBUTION
FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIUSE COASTAL AREAS

areas (MPAs) (Milazzo et al., 2002; Coma et al., 2004; Luna et al., 2009) and coral reefs in tropical and

subtropical waters are highly demanded. Coral habitats in particular suffer high intensity of diving,

especially in the Red Sea (&gt;250 000 dives yr?1 in Eilat, 12 km of coast; &gt;30 000 dives yr?1 in Dahab;
20 000 dives yr?1 per mooring buoy in Ras Mohammed National Park Medio et al., 1997; Zakai

and Chadwick-Furman, 2002; Hasler and Ott, 2008)), the Grand Barrier Reef in Australia (10 000–

20 000 dives yr?1 Harriott et al., 1997) and the Caribbean (5000–6000 dives yr?1 Hawkins et al., 1999).

The rapid growth of scuba diving led to increasing concerns of the impacts of the activity all over

the world (Medio et al., 1997; Jameson et al., 1999; Tratalos and Austin, 2001; Coma et al., 2004)

which adds to other existing threats. Rocky areas in tempered waters are also impacted by many

disturbance factors, mostly related to human activities such as urban development, fishing and

recreational activities (Crowe et al., 2000; Milazzo et al., 2002; Lloret and Riera, 2008), while coral

reefs are severely threatened by overfishing, pollution, climate change and ocean acidification (e.g.

Hughes et al., 2003; Hoegh-Guldberg, 2010; Pandolfi et al., 2011), leading to phase shifts, spread of

diseases and decline of the high biodiversity typical of these habitats (e.g. Knowlton, 2001; Hughes

et al., 2007; Plaisance et al., 2011).

Several studies were conducted to identify the impacts and calculate the carrying capacity

of intensively used dive sites (e.g. Davis and Tisdell, 1995; Medio et al., 1997; Hawkins et al.,

1999; Zakai and Chadwick-Furman, 2002; Barker and Roberts, 2004). Even though considered an

“ecofriendly” activity, several impacts have been identified and associated to scuba diving leading

to the degradation of marine ecosystems (e.g. Harriott et al., 1997; Zakai and Chadwick-Furman,

2002; Barker and Roberts, 2004; Coma et al., 2004; Luna et al., 2009). In coral reefs, the coral cover

decreased in intensively dived areas due to total or partial mortality (Rouphael and Inglis, 1997;

Hawkins et al., 1999; Jameson et al., 1999; Tratalos and Austin, 2001; Zakai and Chadwick-Furman,

2002; Hasler and Ott, 2008; Leujak and Ormond, 2008; Hannak et al., 2011). Although studies to

assess the impacts of scuba diving in temperate waters are scarce (Garrabou et al., 1998; Coma

et al., 2004; Di Franco et al., 2009; Luna et al., 2009), damage in species characteristic of pre-

coralligenous, coralligenous and sciaphilous habitats have been found to be significant (Coma

et al., 2004; Luna-Pérez et al., 2010). Mitigation measures to reduce or alleviate those impacts

have been frequently suggested, constituting important tools for the management of dived areas

(protected or not).

In the Algarve, shallow water subtidal rocky areas present a rich benthic community (Gonçalves

et al., 2007, 2010), with a mixed assemblage of gorgonian species standing out as important habitat

formers and the most conspicuous fauna. These gorgonian gardens that enhance local biodiversity

by harbouring a rich and diverse associated fauna (Carvalho et al., sub.) extend to deeper waters

and have been recently proposed to be included in OSPAR’s protected habitats (Anonymous, 2011).

Rocky areas with gorgonian gardens are attractive seascapes very popular among scuba divers

185

(Rodrigues, 2008) and are therefore prone to impacts resulting from such activity. Also, dived

areas, such as the Algarve coast, commonly serve multiple purposes such as fishing and boating,

and are often the subject of stakeholders’ conflicting interests. To properly manage multi-use

areas it is important to understand and quantify the impacts of each use, namely scuba diving, in

order to build management plans to restore the impacted areas and achieve a balance between

preservation of biodiversity and resource utilization. The main goal of this study is to assess

the impact of scuba diving in the Algarve coast. Specific objectives are: i) estimate the rate

of scuba divers’ actions according to their diving experience; ii) to determine whether the rate

of actions is similar along different diving time frames (10 min and 10–30 min); iii) to identify

the main actions performed by the scuba divers that interact with the environment and their

immediate consequences; and, iv) compare scuba divers’ behaviour on rocky areas and wrecks.

The identification and quantification of the main actions and their consequences will be discussed

considering their estimated impacts and strategies will be pointed out to prevent those actions and

minimize their consequences. Conservation measures will be proposed and discussed according

to the main facts observed.

6.2.1. Study area

The Algarve presents a large diversity of features within its coastal zone, from rocky cliffs

surrounding small bays to large sandy beaches with low slope and small scattered rocky areas or

submerged fossilized ancient dunes. Furthermore, there are a few wrecks with differing ages that

currently are used for scuba diving. The entire coastal zone is subjected to several anthropogenic

pressures, namely urban development for housing and tourism, intensive use of the areas for

recreational activities, boating and both sport and commercial fishing, the latter with a wide

range of fishing gears and techniques. The coastal zone of the Algarve is very productive due

to seasonal upwelling and its marine communities are rich and diverse, benefiting from the

convergence of waters from different regions, namely the Mediterranean Sea, the North Atlantic

and the Northwest coast of Africa (Cherubin et al., 2000; Martins et al., 2002; Souto et al., 2010; Levy

et al., 2011). Moreover, there are important transitional systems in the Algarve, namely estuarine-

lagoon systems such as the Ria de Alvor and the Guadiana and barrier islands such as the Ria

Formosa (Carvalho et al., in press) which have been extensively studied and proven to be important

nursery areas (Abecasis et al., 2009; Vasconcelos et al., 2010, 2011). Despite the ecological relevance

of the region, marine reserves have not yet been established in the Algarve coast and the strategy

for marine species and habitats protection is based on the Habitats Directive and Natura 2000.

6.2.2. Sampling strategy

In order to estimate the impact of recreational scuba diving in the Algarve coast, scuba divers

were monitored underwater. The samples were collected during regular scuba diving trips of three

diving centres that participated in the study and are representative of the offer in the region. The

23 diving sites that were considered fall into two different categories, rocky areas (subtidal rocky

bottoms; 19 sites) and wrecks (shipwrecks and a World War II downed airplane; 4 sites). These

categories are representative of the Algarve diving areas with much more rocky sites than wrecks

(Santos et al., 2006). Between 2005 and 2007, during the summer, 120 dives were monitored, but

only 105 of them proved to have the necessary requirements to be analysed with no bias, 76 in

rocky areas and 29 in wreck areas.

All underwater surveys were carried out by the same two observers ( J. Cúrdia and M. Ferreira).

Preliminary surveys were performed to define sampling strategy, set the criteria for actions,

consequences and impacts, and to check sampling consistency. These surveys indicated that it was

impracticable to record the exact timing of each action, therefore two time frames were defined:

the first 10 min of the dive (starting from the moment that the scuba diver reached the seafloor

and started the recreational dive) and the following 10–30 min. It was also defined that after the

30 min of dive, the contacts, actions, consequences and impacts continued to be monitored until

the end of the recreational dive (i.e. whenever the dive leader or any of the dive buddies declared

that the dive had finished and divers should start to ascend) and the total dive time was annotated.

Furthermore, because of local oceanographic conditions, namely reduced visibility, each observer

was only able to monitor one or two different divers in each dive. The sets of data from both

observers after some dives were found to be very similar, allowing the comparison of data collected

by both observers, assuming negligible bias. The criteria used in assessing the impacts were set

according to the preliminary surveys and published information (Figure 6.1). The actions that

were ranked as having higher impact were those that introduced any kind of stress to animals, or

significantly harmed the biological entities or its habitat. The actions that produced no observable

consequence were rated as low impact actions.

Information regarding the experience and certification level of the scuba divers was collected by

informally inquiring scuba divers and diving centres’ staff. Three levels of diving experience were

defined: low (less than 20 dives), moderate (20–50 dives) and high (more than 50 dives). During

pre-dive briefing all the scuba divers in each diving trip were informed that the observers were

conducting surveys to identify marine fauna and therefore would take notes during the dive. For

each diver the actions and behaviours were recorded, as well as the immediate consequence of the

scuba diver action. The impact of the consequence was assessed “in situ” in real time according

to the previously set of criteria (Figure 6.1). In the post-dive, generally, the scuba divers were

curious about the number of species identified and whether they have seen the same species. The

CHAPTER 6. SCUBA DIVERS’ PROFILE AND THEIR IMPACTS ON THE BENTHIC ENVIRONMENT: A CONTRIBUTION
FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIUSE COASTAL AREAS

observers described briefly the main observed species and alerted for extra caution, especially

towards some focal species, and for the correct behaviour while diving (e.g. avoid the interaction

with species, no feeding). Due to diving constraints (divers got lost, gear malfunction, etc...) some

dives were not used for the analysis as they were significantly biased. Divers that got aware of the

observers’ purposes were also excluded from the analysis. The 105 dives used in the current work

all correspond to valid samples.

6.2.3. Statistical analyses

Contact rates were defined in the present work as the number of contacts performed by the

scuba diver in a determined period of time. The different time frames sampled have different

(and variable) duration (10 min, 20 min, 0–30 min), therefore data was standardised for time units

(i.e. contacts min?1). Contact rates data did not show a normal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov

test), consequently non-parametric tests were used to test the significance of the differences

between groups of samples. The contact rates for different experience levels were compared for

each diving site category (rocky areas vs. wrecks) using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test (paired

tests). For the contact rates of different periods of the dive (initial 10 min, 10–30 min, block data)

the Friedman test was used (Legendre and Legendre, 1998; Barker and Roberts, 2004).

6.3. Results

6.3.1. Scuba diver characterization

In the present work, the study subjects (divers) were generally men (81.6 %, significant deviance

from the a 0.5 ratio, p &amp;lt;0.001, binomial test). Most divers were between 20–40 yr old, and only
a few subjects were more than 50 yr old. Samples included tourists visiting the Algarve, both

national and international visitors, and local scuba divers, mostly regular customers of the diving

centres. National citizens accounted for 67.0 % of the studied subjects, a percentage that does not

agree with the expected ratio for Algarve (4 Portuguese: 6 Foreigner, unpublished data; p &amp;lt;0.001,
binomial test) based on data gathered from unofficial enquiries (Santos et al., 2006). The logistic

constraints (64 dives in Faro, 22 dives in Vilamoura and 18 dives in Lagos) may have also influenced

these numbers as the diving centre from Lagos estimates that around 95 % of their divers are

from foreign countries, whereas the other two centres, estimate around 10 % (Faro) and 50 %

(Vilamoura). Nevertheless, the authors are convinced that the used dataset is representative of the

scuba diving market in the Algarve typically with a strong spatial and seasonal variation (Santos

et al., 2006).

6.3.2. Scuba diver’s interactions

Overall, 93 of the 105 observed divers (88.6 %) made one or more contacts during their dive.

From the 93 divers with contacts, 34 of them made up to 5 contacts in a single dive, and 55

made 10 or less contacts. However, 37 divers presented between 11and30 contacts and one

scuba diver presented 54 contacts in a single dive (60 min). Overall, the mean contact rate was

0.340 ± 0.028 contacts min?1 (±SE) and the median was 0.27 contacts min?1. The distribution
of contact rates at rocky areas and wrecks was not normally distributed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov

test, p &amp;lt;0.05) but skewed towards low rates (skewness, 0.92 and 1.21, respectively) consistently
resulting in lower median values than the mean contact rates at both dive site types (Table 6.1).

Most of the divers made contacts, independently of dive site type (rocky areas and wrecks) and

experience level (low, moderate and high experience) (Figure 6.2).

FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIUSE COASTAL AREAS

Figure 6.2.: Number of scuba divers showing contacts in relation to the total number of sampled scuba
divers discriminated by diving experience for rocky areas and wrecks.

6.3.3. Factors influencing the rate of contacts

In general, the rate of contacts by scuba divers was higher in the initial part of the dive (10 min)

than in the middle/final part of the dive (Table 6.1 and Figure 6.3). In fact, of the 105 divers

analysed only 19 increased the number of contacts after the initial 10 min of the dive, most of them

presenting low contact rates (13 divers under 0.2 contacts min?1.)

In rocky areas, moderate and high experience divers, showed significantly higher contact

rates in the initial 10 min of the dive (Friedman test, ?2 = 7.14, p &amp;lt;0.01 and 17.19, p &amp;lt;0.001,
respectively; Table 6.1 and Figure 6.3). Noteworthy, in the initial 10 min of the dive in rocky areas,

high experience divers showed the lowest rates (0.40 contacts min?1) whereas the highest rates

(0.60 contacts min?1) were from moderate experience divers.

In the wreck areas, the contact rates were generally higher in the initial part of the dive (10 min)

for all experience levels. However, contact rates were only significantly higher in the initial part

of the dive (10 min) for moderate experience divers (Friedman test ?2 = 6.23, p &amp;lt;0.05; Table 6.1
and Figure 6.3). For low and high experience levels, the differences between contact rates were

not found significant, because of the small number of samples (low power of the test) and the high

variability in wrecks’ data. Similarly to rocky areas, high experienced divers presented the lowest

rates (median 0.15 contacts min?1) and moderate experienced divers the highest rates (median

0.50 contacts min?1) in the first 10 min of the dive.

192



CHAPTER 6. SCUBA DIVERS’ PROFILE AND THEIR IMPACTS ON THE BENTHIC ENVIRONMENT: A CONTRIBUTION
FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIUSE COASTAL AREAS

Contact rates (total dive, 0–10 min and 10–30 min) generally decreased with increasing exper-

ience of the diver (Table 6.1). However, only the difference in the contact rates of the initial part

of the dive (0–10 min) of moderate and high experience levels of wreck divers were found to be

significant (Wilcoxon test, z = ?0.72, p &amp;lt;0.01). Contact rates in rocky areas were generally higher
than in wrecks, but no significant differences were found when comparing the two types of dive

sites (Wilcoxon test, p &gt; 0.05).

6.3.4. Impacts on marine ecosystem

The vast majority of “contacts” that were observed during the surveys were physical con-

tacts with the substrate and marine organisms (mostly unintentional) and only a few cases

of interactions with biota (97.1 % vs. 2.9 %). In rocky areas, 52.5 % of the contacts were fins

touching the substrate or organisms, 23.0 % were hand contacts, 14.3 % were body contacts

(Figure 6.4) and 7.4 % were gear contacts. Interactions with fauna were rare (2.7 %). A different

pattern was observed in wreck areas mainly because contacts were made primarily using hands

(48.6 %), followed by fins (22.4 %) whereas gear, body and interactions with fauna presented similar

percentages to those observed in rocky areas (Figure 6.4).

Both at rocky areas and wrecks, it was impossible to discern any immediate consequence of a

large quantity of the contacts (Unidentified, 58.4 % and 73.3 %, respectively). On the other hand,

some of the contacts had a clear consequence. The most frequent case at both dive site types

was the re-suspension of sediment (raising sediment, 29.0 % and 14.8 %, respectively), whereas

the remaining actions and their consequences directly involved the biota living at the seafloor. In

rocky areas, a total of 103 contacts with marine species were made and had different consequences,

namely the disturbance of fauna (mainly fish, cephalopods and crustaceans; 4.5 %), contacts with

colonial invertebrates without breakage (contact with fauna, 3.5 %), contacts with macroalgae

(contact with flora, 3.1 %), breaking of colonial benthic species (gorgonians and bryozoans, 1.3 %)

and a single event of fish feeding.

Regarding the possible effects of the contacts on the habitat as a whole, both at rocky areas

and wrecks, most were rated by the observers as low (74.2 % and 86.7 %, respectively) and a

total of 21 contacts were considered as having a high potential to harm the marine environment

with similar percentages at both dive site types. The relative percentage of contacts presenting

moderate impact was two times higher for rocky areas than for wreck areas (23.7 % and 11.4 %,

respectively). Actions rated as low impact were the contacts with macroalgae and sediment re-

suspension (88.0 % and 68.6 %, respectively) as most of the contacts which were classified as

undetermined due to observation constraints (Unidentified; 84.5 %). On the other hand, organism

breakage, disturbance and contacts with fauna were primarily associated to moderate and/or high

193

impacts (63.6 %, 52.7 % and 47.2 %, respectively; Figure 6.5). Moderate/high impact events were

more frequent in rocky areas, such as organism breakage (not observed at wrecks) and fauna

disturbance were more frequent in rocky areas (Figure 6.5). The latter consisted mainly on scuba

divers harassing the marine fauna, namely chasing fish and cephalopods, distressing octopus or

cryptic fish species in their hides and holding echinoderms or other invertebrates.

6.4. Discussion

Diving has been frequently associated to habitat degradation, with higher damage levels in

dived sites than in nearby non visited sites (Hawkins et al., 1999; Tratalos and Austin, 2001; Hasler

and Ott, 2008). In coral reef areas, the coral cover decreased in sites intensively dived (Tratalos

and Austin, 2001; Hasler and Ott, 2008) and damage especially of massive and branching corals is

high (Hawkins et al., 1999; Zakai and Chadwick-Furman, 2002; Hasler and Ott, 2008; Leujak and

Ormond, 2008).

Most impacts result from direct contacts with the fins to the substrate and marine fauna

(Rouphael and Inglis, 1997, 2001; Zakai and Chadwick-Furman, 2002; Barker and Roberts, 2004;

Uyarra and Coté, 2007; Leujak and Ormond, 2008), which was confirmed in the present study.

Contacts with hands were also frequently observed, as it has also been reported elsewhere,

195



PART IV. HUMAN PRESSURES IN THE ALGARVE SUBLITTORAL ROCKY BOTTOMS

especially in coral reefs (Rouphael and Inglis, 1997; Zakai and Chadwick-Furman, 2002; Barker

and Roberts, 2004; Uyarra and Coté, 2007; Leujak and Ormond, 2008; Luna et al., 2009). Hand

contacts dominated in wreck areas, most of them intentional contacts conducted by moderate

experience divers, probably because these scuba divers actively search for objects and fauna

(entrances, holes). Active search for some animals, especially cryptic species, has been found to

dramatically increase the rate of contacts and the damage inflicted to the benthic environment

(Uyarra and Coté, 2007). Nevertheless, in the present study, intentional contacts to interact with

fauna accounted for less than 5 % at both rocky areas and wrecks.

The main impacts on the environment (mainly on local fauna) resulting from contacts with the

fins were the re-suspension of sediment and the subsequent persistence of nepheloid layers, as

well as the physical contacts with fauna (with different outcomes, e.g. breakage, tissue abrasion).

Indeed, occurrence of nepheloid layers may lead fish and motile invertebrates to avoid the area

and affect suspension-feeding sessile organisms such as gorgonians (Sala et al., 1996; Garrabou

et al., 1998; Milazzo et al., 2002; Zakai and Chadwick-Furman, 2002; Airoldi, 2003; Balata et al.,

2005; Leujak and Ormond, 2008; Luna-Pérez et al., 2011) and ascidians (Luna-Pérez et al., 2010,

2011). Direct contacts to the fauna may damage important habitat building species, such as stony

corals, gorgonians, sponges and bryozoans, significantly contributing to habitat deterioration

(Sala et al., 1996; Garrabou et al., 1998; Hawkins et al., 1999; Coma et al., 2004; Uyarra and Coté,

2007; Hasler and Ott, 2008; Leujak and Ormond, 2008; Di Franco et al., 2009). In this study, we

observed scuba divers unintentionally breaking, sometimes extensively, large bryozoans such as

Pentapora fascialis. These fragile colonial organisms are frequently damaged in intensively used

dive sites resulting in important effects in density, size and coverage, altering the structure of this

species’ populations (Sala et al., 1996; Garrabou et al., 1998). Although this species is known to

recover rapidly from disturbance (Coma et al., 2004) it has potential as an indicator for scuba diving

impacts.

The most conspicuous fauna in dived areas of the Algarve is, however, a mixed assemblage of

gorgonian species, especially Eunicella labiata, Eunicella gazella, Eunicella verrucosa, Leptogorgia

lusitanica and Leptogorgia sarmentosa (Cúrdia et al., sub.a). Although not very frequent, trampling

over gorgonians was observed in the present study, with consequent damage to gorgonian tissues

and leading to partial mortality and breakage. Partial mortality in gorgonians results in reduced

growth and reproductive effort and to a higher risk of predation and colonization by epifauna

(Coma et al., 2004; Linares et al., 2008c). In the Algarve, gorgonians are among the largest benthic

animals, providing habitat for other species and enhancing local biodiversity (Carvalho et al.,

sub.). These long-lived animals have typically low recruitment rates, low growth and long turnover-

times (Mistri and Ceccherelli, 1994; Coma et al., 1998a, 2004; Linares et al., 2008b). Consequently,

damage produced by diver contact becomes a more severe and chronic disturbance due to low

recoverability (Coma et al., 2004; Di Franco et al., 2009; Luna-Pérez et al., 2010).

196



CHAPTER 6. SCUBA DIVERS’ PROFILE AND THEIR IMPACTS ON THE BENTHIC ENVIRONMENT: A CONTRIBUTION
FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIUSE COASTAL AREAS

Interactions with fauna (chasing fish, playing with seastars, octopus and cuttlefish) may also

result in moderate to high impacts on local fauna, as stress resulting from the interactions

may increase the probability of animals being predated, cause energy waste and disrupt crucial

phases of species’ biological cycles (Frid and Dill, 2002; MacFarlane and King, 2002; Chuchman,

2006; Cubero-Pardo et al., 2011; Teresa et al., 2011), namely spawning (Heyman et al., 2010).

Furthermore, some species (e.g. groupers) are more sensitive than others (e.g. snappers) and daily

visits by scuba divers of a “permanent” spawning aggregation site can create sufficient disturbance

for fish species to move to other areas (Heyman et al., 2010). Another common interaction with

fauna (yet rarely observed in this study) is fish feeding which has been proved to affect directly and

indirectly the structure of coastal fish assemblages (Milazzo et al., 2005, 2006; Ilarri et al., 2008).

The extremely low frequency of fish feeding in the present study probably resulted from a general

awareness of the diving centres that systematically advise divers on the detrimental effects of fish

feeding.

Even though scuba diving is a rather small industry in the Algarve, its growth in the past few

years and the national and regional strategy to maintain tourism as an important source of income

for the region (Anonymous, 2006; Correia and Pires, 2006), suggests that the pressure on the marine

ecosystem posed by this recreational activity may increase rapidly. Moreover, considering that 15 %

of the divers do moderate/high impact contacts with rates above 1.5 contacts 10 min?1 the threats

to marine habitats will increase.

The main conclusions of the present study are:

1. experienced divers present lower contact rates than moderate and low experienced divers

(specialization matters)

2. contact rates are highest in the initial part of the dive (time matters)

3. contact rates in wrecks are lower than in natural rocky areas and

4. most contacts in natural rocky areas are fin contacts whereas in wrecks hand contacts

dominate (dive site types present different diving profiles)

Facing these main findings, some measures can be applied in order to prevent and/or reduce

the damage inflicted to marine communities. As increased knowledge and skills (specialization)

are determinant for changing the behaviour of scuba divers, improved diver training is a key

factor to minimise their negative impacts on the seafloor (Thapa et al., 2005, 2006; Ong and

Musa, 2011). Specialization should be reinforced by educational programs that can be formulated

by various stakeholders (e.g. marine conservation organizations, governmental agencies and

the diving industry) (Thapa et al., 2006; Pepe, 2010; Ong and Musa, 2011). Environmental

197



PART IV. HUMAN PRESSURES IN THE ALGARVE SUBLITTORAL ROCKY BOTTOMS

awareness influences the scuba divers’ behaviour (Ong and Musa, 2011), therefore educational and

certification programmes should include elements on general marine conservation issues and on

the environmental impact of diving (e.g. videos of scuba divers’ actions and their consequences)

which may eventually build a responsible diving behaviour (Rouphael and Inglis, 1997; Zakai and

Chadwick-Furman, 2002; Thapa et al., 2006; Dearden et al., 2007; Pepe, 2010; Ong and Musa, 2011).

These programs should emphasize positive actions to preserve the marine ecosystem advising

on good-practise and code of conduct during dives and promoting continued education and

“eco-friendly” social activities (Thapa et al., 2006; Ong and Musa, 2011), instead of focusing on

penalties, boundaries and prohibited activities (Ong and Musa, 2011). Pre- and post-dive briefing

sessions, conducted by a divemaster have been strongly recommended (Rouphael and Inglis,

1997; Schleyer and Tomalin, 2000; Thapa et al., 2006; Dearden et al., 2007; Ong and Musa, 2011)

and proven to be successful at reducing impacts (Medio et al., 1997; Barker and Roberts, 2004;

Uyarra and Coté, 2007). But the content of the session should extend beyond rules, regulations

and safety procedures, providing information about diving sites, particular features of the aquatic

environment (including marine life), diving conditions or needed diving skills needed (Ong and

Musa, 2011). Experienced scuba divers tend to erroneously perceive that the amount of damage

they may cause is relatively minor and, therefore, are less likely to modify their own behaviour

(Rouphael and Inglis, 2001). In this regard, briefings are likely to be more effective if they

emphasize the potential for cumulative impacts as a result of the sum of relatively minor effects

of many individual divers and/or successive dives (Rouphael and Inglis, 2001). A diving code

of conduct can be integrated by dive masters and instructors into pre-dive briefings and other

diving courses which may help to reinforce the importance of ethics and responsible behaviour

(Thapa et al., 2006). It is important to emphasize that the training of divemasters and instructors

is also fundamental to achieve this goal. The intervention of divemasters to alert and correct

unintentional/intentional behaviours proved to be significant at reducing the number of contacts,

and therefore at reducing the scuba diving impacts on marine habitats (Medio et al., 1997; Luna

et al., 2009). Therefore, as suggested elsewhere, all dives should be guided by trained divemasters

or dive guides (Zakai and Chadwick-Furman, 2002; Barker and Roberts, 2004; Luna et al., 2009).

Their example in keeping hands and equipment away from the substrate and vigilance especially

at the beginning of dives and towards the users of special equipment (cameras, flash-lights) or

dives (night dives), may significantly reduce the impacts (Barker and Roberts, 2004). Small groups

are advisable as this will ease the ability of dive leaders to perform their supervisory role (Rudd and

Tupper, 2002; Barker and Roberts, 2004).

Taking into account that impacts were higher at the initial part of the dive and in natural

rocky areas than in wrecks, carefully planning of scuba diving trails and starting the dive in

areas with lower benthic cover are good measures to reduce the number of contacts. Locating

training courses and introductory dives in sandy areas or nearby artificial reefs is also advisable

as, whenever possible, recreational diver pressure must be diverted away from natural coral reefs

198



CHAPTER 6. SCUBA DIVERS’ PROFILE AND THEIR IMPACTS ON THE BENTHIC ENVIRONMENT: A CONTRIBUTION
FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIUSE COASTAL AREAS

to artificial reef areas (Zakai and Chadwick-Furman, 2002; Hasler and Ott, 2008). In the Algarve,

scuba divers prefer to dive in preserved natural reefs looking to observe unusual fish or other less

common aquatic organism, but they also state a high preference for wrecks, namely those with

archaeological interest and sunken vessels (Ramos et al., 2006). In addition, the data presented

here suggests that in wrecks, contact rates are generally lower, globally reducing the impacts of

scuba diving. However, due to the relatively low number of samples (29) data should be addressed

with caution. Ships have been sunk worldwide to enhance the scuba diving market at the local level

(Abelson, 2006; Seaman, 2007) and their economic value has already been documented (Morgan

and Massey, 2009, and references therein). However, the medium/long term effects of sinking

decommissioned vessels are poorly studied. Despite the preparation that is usually involved in

the process, degradation of vessel materials and leakage may increase concentrations of hazard

materials and result in contamination, and other possible negative impacts such as community

structure shifts in fish and macrobenthic assemblages (attraction of fish species) and spread of

invasive species (Johnston et al., 2003, 2005; Davis et al., 2007; Glasby et al., 2007). Therefore,

sinking vessels for scuba diving must be carefully planned to predict environmental hazards

and when implemented, long-term monitoring using multidisciplinary approaches is strongly

recommended.

It is important to integrate legal, scientific and management tools in order to build robust

conservation plans. In more sensitive areas, diving can be restricted to experienced divers and/or

diving quotas may be applied to reduce impacts (Luna et al., 2009). Research should be carried out

to investigate the benthic community vulnerability and resilience and assess sensitivity to diving

impacts (Lloret et al., 2006). Also, monitoring programmes (Milazzo et al., 2002) using vulnerable

or sensitive species (e.g. gorgonians and bryozoans) as focal species should be implemented to

assess the success of management measures (Garrabou et al., 1998; Coma et al., 2004; Di Franco

et al., 2009; Luna-Pérez et al., 2010, 2011).

The estimated number of 5390 divers using scuba diving centres in the area (for the year 2004,

Santos et al., 2006) is much lower than the estimated 11 200 divers yr?1 of the Parque Marinho Luís

Saldanha, the most important diving location in Portugal (Rodrigues, 2008) and also lower than

the mean 7123 divers yr?1 of European MPAs (Roncin et al., 2008), and may be lower than the

carrying capacity of the system. The Algarve coast yields attractive habitats of high biodiversity

and ecological importance, harbouring vulnerable benthic fauna and it is subjected to multiple

purposes. The main results of this study suggest that these focal points should be addressed with

caution and used to define the guidelines for carrying capacity estimation in the region. As pointed

out by Luna et al. (2009, see references therein) scuba diving carrying capacity vary extensively

between different sites/areas around the world, due to several factors, such as physical conditions,

natural disturbance events, biological communities in the area and anthropogenic pressures. As a

consequence, the real carrying capacity of the system is dynamic and any measure to be used for

199

management purposes should be adapted to each particular dive site and reviewed periodically

(Luna et al., 2009).

C.1. Conclusions

Ecological relevance of gorgonian gardens

Shallow water gorgonian assemblages in Southern Portugal are mainly characterized by a co-

dominance of several species (Eunicella labiata, Eunicella gazella, Eunicella verrucosa, Leptogorgia

lusitanica and Leptogorgia sarmentosa) that do not compete themselves for space but, because of

different habitat requirements or preferences, occupy different niches. Leptogorgia sarmentosa,

for example, is mainly found in areas where the re-suspension of sediments is common, whereas

Leptogorgia lusitanica is frequently observed in places with stronger currents (vertical walls) and

open spaces with low sedimentation (terraces).

The abundance of gorgonians increases with depth showing a negative correlation with erect

algae. The abundance of algae generally decreases with depth because light is a limiting factor, and

the benthic cover becomes dominated by animals probably due to lower competition for space

with algae. On the other hand, a positive correlation between the abundance of gorgonians and

the abundance of sponges (Porifera) was observed. Because of their quasi bi-dimensional erect

shape, gorgonians do not occupy a large space in the substratum, which may be used by other

benthic groups such as sponges, bryozoans, other cnidarians or coralline algae, maximizing space

occupancy, heterogeneity and complexity of the sea-bottoms, and ultimately biodiversity.

Colonies of Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica in the studied sites presented a diverse

(11 phyla, 181 taxa) and abundant (7284 individuals) associated fauna, numerically dominated

by amphipods but with polychaetes contributing the most to diversity. The analysis of diversity

patterns, within and between gorgonian hosts, at both spatial and temporal scales, showed that

these two gorgonians were somehow complementary to the biodiversity of the habitat as a whole.

Gorgonian host, colony size and time were the most important factors in determining high levels of

diversity. The results suggest that biodiversity patterns are better defined by differences in relative

abundances rather than in species composition. Even though the ecological function of both

species is not entirely redundant, each adding new niches to the system and supporting attendant

assemblages, the two gorgonians (all colonies pooled) shared most of the species collected, and

only 11 and 18 mostly rare or uncommon taxa were exclusively associated with Eunicella gazella

and Leptogorgia lusitanica, respectively (excluding singletons). The abundant unidentified white

flatworms (Turbellaria) in Eunicella gazella colonies was the only exclusive species to show a

significant association to its host which may be explained by crypsis with the white colour of the

gorgonian branches.

The differences in attendant assemblages, were partially explained by species-specific attrib-

210



CONCLUSIONS

utes (size, complexity, lacunarity) but the main structuring factor appears to be the presence and

fouling level of colonial epibionts (e.g. hydrozoans, sponges) and algae. Possibly due to a trophic

effect (direct or indirect enhancement of food availability) combined with surface availability for

colonization (species-area effect), “colonial epibiont cover” was the strongest predictor of species

richness and abundance of gorgonians’ attendant assemblages. Moreover, the validity of the

paradigm that structural complexity enhances biodiversity may be scale-dependent and, in the

case of gorgonians, the effect of complexity at the “garden” level may be much more relevant than

at the individual colony level. These findings reinforce the need for the conservation of gorgonian

aggregation areas as a whole in order to preserve host diversity and size structure.

Life history

Shifts, resulting from disturbance or protection, may lead to different effects in species with

different traits (Halpern and Warner, 2002; Claudet et al., 2010), therefore the knowledge on the life

history and traits of species, especially those more vulnerable to impacts is extremely important

for marine conservation. Longevity, time to maturity, reproductive mode, fecundity and propagule

dispersal are some examples of traits conditioning the distribution patterns and the population

dynamics of marine benthic species (Bremner, 2008), especially because of the importance of the

earliest life history stage (egg or larva in gorgonians) (e.g. Linares et al., 2007, 2008b; Cowen and

Sponaugle, 2009).

The oogenic cycle of Eunicella gazella is long (over one year), with colonies presenting high

fertility and spawning of mature oocytes occurring in September/October. The spermatogenic

cycle occurs over a shorter period of time (eight to ten months), but maturation and spawning

of both sexes is highly synchronized. Temperature seems to govern the maturation of gonads,

probably being related both to metabolic efficiency and food availability. Broadcast spawning is

preliminarily pointed out as the mode of reproduction but more studies are needed in order to

fully understand this reproductive feature. However, the study on the gametogenesis of Eunicella

gazella does shed light on the reproductive pattern of one of the most abundant and common

gorgonian species of the Algarve, but for which no data was available on any reproductive aspect.

Even though the present study could not find a clear effect of colony size on fertility, further

studies should be specifically designed to ascertain this issue. The gametogenic cycle of other

species that are frequent and abundant should also be studied, especially for Eunicella labiata

and Leptogorgia lusitanica, as reproductive data on these species is entirely missing. On the other

hand, Leptogorgia sarmentosa and Eunicella verrucosa, should also be studied as the information

available to the moment is still scarce (a single study for each species).

211

Impacts

Despite the high biodiversity associated with gorgonians, they are subjected to several pres-

sures. The present study presents evidence that the population structure of gorgonian assemblages

along the southern coast of the Algarve, can be related not only to differences in the physical

characteristics of each area but also to the natural and anthropogenic pressures that act specifically

upon them. In the case of anthropogenic pressures, fishing is pointed as the most probable

damaging factor, as all the remaining activities do not seem to have broad regional differences.

In disturbed areas (due to fishing and/or frequent sedimentation) gorgonian populations were

dominated by small-sized colonies, clearly different from the population structure of areas under

lower disturbance. Because several biological processes are density-dependent or size-dependent

(e.g. Kapela and Lasker, 1999; Vermeij and Sandin, 2008; Tanner et al., 2009; Forrester et al.,

2010), this information is of utmost importance for the study of those processes. On the other

hand, damage in gorgonian colonies in fishing areas was commonly observed (broken colonies;

entangled nets, angling lines and cables from cages; recently detached colonies with different

damage levels implying frequent disturbance) and sometimes extensive. Indeed, preliminary

results concerning damage assessment in gorgonian colonies along the Algarve southern coastal

waters further support the assumption that fishing may exert a high pressure on gorgonian

assemblages. In two natural reef areas with high fishing intensity, Pedra da Greta and Pedra

do Barril, colony damage (fouling, denuded axis, breakage; estimated underwater) was assessed

in gorgonian colonies of Leptogorgia lusitanica, Leptogorgia sarmentosa, Eunicella gazella and

Eunicella labiata. It was found that the percentage of damaged colonies was high at both sites

and all species, ranging from 81.3 to 100 %. However, some differences were found between

the two genera, with Leptogorgia species being mainly characterized by small damaged colony

areas, whereas Eunicella colonies were extensively damaged (see Figure C.1). The Leptogorgia

were mainly damaged in the tips of the colonies, probably due to abrasion with seafloor or other

biota as they are very flexible, presenting low percentage of broken colonies, 5.5–9.6 % and 18.8–

25.0 % for Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril, respectively. This kind of colony structure copes well

with trampling from fishing traps, for example, because as soon as the gear is hauled the colony

reverts to its upright position. On the other hand, Eunicella colonies presented extensive fouling

by algae (mainly in the tips), bryozoans, barnacles and anemones and were frequently entangled in

fishing gears. Furthermore, a large proportion of the sampled colonies were broken (12.9–50.0 %),

especially Eunicella labiata that showed 43.3 and 50.0 % of broken colonies in Pedra do Barril and

Pedra da Greta, respectively. Contrastingly, underwater observations in areas under lower fishing

intensity suggested that gorgonians present much lower damage rates and the extension of lesions

is also much lower.

For several decades tourism has been increasing in the Algarve region and scuba diving is

one of the recreational activities which promotes a particularly direct interaction with gorgonian

gardens. However, at least regarding scuba diving, at present levels, this activity does not seem to

compromise gorgonian assemblages. The present study indicates that scuba divers in the Algarve

make contacts to the seafloor and benthic biota, impacting marine rocky habitats, especially

in the initial part of the dive. Even though the impacts are generally low, the increasing trend

of the activity in the region may lead to greater impacts. What is more, some of the impacts

present high damage, such as breakage of sessile benthic organisms. This is particularly important

when the affected organisms are ecologically important (habitat formers) but characterized by low

recruitment rates, low growth, long lifespan and long turnover-times, such as gorgonians. In these

cases, regeneration may impair for example growth and reproduction, leading to more severe and

chronic disturbance effects due to low recoverability.

C.2. Final remarks

The joint effect of small-sized dominated colonies in disturbed areas and the fact that the

enhancement of biodiversity promoted by gorgonians is size-dependent, the reduction of gor-

gonian populations and the shift towards smaller sizes due to fisheries impacts will implicate a

decrease in the local biodiversity (? and ? diversity) with possible implications for the shallow

rocky subtidal (meta)community. The lower population size, smaller colonies and damaged

colonies may also decrease the ecological services attributed to gorgonians (e.g. scuba diving, fish

213

protection). Most sessile marine organisms depend on water circulation to promote the encounter

of gametes. In many corals, one of the species traits to increase reproduction success is sperm

concentration and high synchronization of spawning, leading to huge mass spawns, sometimes

of multiple species (e.g. Babcock et al., 1986; Harrison, 2011). If population size drops below a

certain threshold, the concentration of gametes may be insufficient to guarantee the normal rates

of fecundation of oocytes leading to reproductive failure, thus reducing population growth rates,

sometimes to negative values, increasing the risk of extinction, a classic example of an Allee effect

(Courchamp et al., 1999; Stephens and Sutherland, 1999). There is growing evidence that these

negative density dependent effects are important for species conservation efforts and fisheries

management (Stephens and Sutherland, 1999; Gascoigne and Lipcius, 2004; Courchamp et al.,

2008).

For most marine species, but especially for sessile benthic species, the pelagic larval phase

represents the primary opportunity for dispersal (Cowen et al., 2006; Cowen and Sponaugle,

2009) as long as they produce more larvae than the necessary to assure self-recruitment (source

population). Marine populations suffering continuous impacts rely on larval import from nearby

areas to face extinction and to balance the local negative population growth (Cowen et al., 2006;

Krebs, 2008; Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009). Therefore, the persistence of metapopulations relies

greatly in the larval dispersal capacity between populations (connectivity). The connectivity

between marine populations is very complex, depending on local oceanographic conditions

(spatially complex), stochasticity (yearly fluctuations, natural disturbance) and biological traits

(vertical movements, interactions), which differ greatly between species (Cowen et al., 2007; Jones

et al., 2007; Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009). Furthermore, in the last decade several studies pointed

that dispersal can be much lower than previously expected (see Cowen et al., 2000, 2007; Cowen

and Sponaugle, 2009; Jones et al., 2009), and therefore connectivity has the potential to strongly

influence local populations (or metapopulations) with consequences for the structure, dynamics

and biodiversity of communities (or metacommunities).

Implications, applications and recommendations

Under the current scenario of multiple uses, impacts and climate change on spatially complex

and dynamic systems, such as coastal areas, density dependent effects, connectivity between

metapopulations and biotic interactions all play important roles in the sustainable use of those

ecosystems. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), or marine reserves if they encompass a “no take”

zone, have been largely used as management tools with two main objectives, fisheries manage-

ment and biodiversity protection (e.g. Pauly et al., 2002; Lubchenco et al., 2003; Jones et al., 2007;

Lester and Halpern, 2008; Pérez-Ruzafa et al., 2008). The conservation of marine ecosystems

in Portugal is mainly regulated by European directives that were transposed to national laws,

214



CONCLUSIONS

and to international conventions that were signed and ratified by Portugal (Birds and Habitats

directives, Natura 2000). The European Union, encourages its members to reach the goal of

creating at least 10 % of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) by 2020 (Aichi Biodiversity Target 11,

http://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/). OSPAR, also points to the development of a network of Marine

Protected Areas as to protect biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the North-East Atlantic.

However, to the author best knowledge, there is currently any plan to achieve such percentage of

MPAs in Portugal mainland in the near future.

Recently, Lester and Halpern (2008) proved that reserve effects are higher in no-take reserves

than in partially protected areas, namely regarding biomass, density, species richness and or-

ganism size. These management tools have been successful in preventing coral loss besides

other advantages and benefits (e.g. Selig and Bruno, 2010; Graham et al., 2011). Location and

size of MPAs greatly determine their outcomes, because coherent sets of marine reserves should

encompass a representative area and collectively represent all the components of the regional

biodiversity. Also, MPAs should have a spillover effect replenishing populations of the adjacent non

protected areas, but in order to fulfil this requirement, metapopulation dynamics must be ensured

through connectivity. This is the reason why currently networks of marine reserves are advocated.

In fact, an efficient network of MPAs must include as many as possible distinctive habitats and

several replicates of representative habitats, have individually or collectively the necessary size to

support minimum viable populations of large species, but also to be oceanographically connected

in a way that ensures an efficient recruitment amongst individual MPAs. These characteristics

should foster the necessary resilience to a number of threats. The location of source populations

(to be protected) is decisive for the connectivity at the local and regional level and will determine

if a network of marine reserves is effective or not (Jones et al., 2007; Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009;

White et al., 2010).

Overall, the results presented in this thesis highlight the ecological importance of gorgonians

in the southern Algarve coastal waters, namely by the enhancement of biodiversity. Impacts

on gorgonian assemblages and their distribution, abundance and structure patterns should be

taken into account while planning local MPAs networks. The reproductive cycle of Eunicella

gazella provides information that can trigger new studies with more ambitious objectives, such

as the connectivity of benthic broadcast spawners and the species traits that can influence the

processes involved. The information on scuba diving impacts can be used to manage this activity

in the region and should also be taken into account in the design of MPAs, as scuba diving

will probably be one of the uses on those areas. The impacts pointed out by this study can

increase the awareness of scuba divers to adopt measures that may significantly decrease their

impacts in the habitat. For example, gorgonians and other benthic species are proposed to

be used as indicators of scuba diving effects, which can be transposed to management plans.

Finally, the indication that gorgonians are frequently and extensively damaged and the difficulties

215

encountered in preliminary transplantation experiments, strongly emphasize the need for more

short term studies focusing on the effects associated to colony damage and that conservation of

gorgonian gardens is of high priority. These preliminary data need to be confirmed by further

sampling and replicated in areas with different intensity of fishing pressure. Studies should also

be conducted to analyse energy use in damaged and healthy colonies of all gorgonian species.

According to the distribution and abundance data (part I) and the extension of damaged colony

area, Eunicella labiata and Eunicella gazella should be focused primarily. This is one clear example

of the usefulness of the information contained in this thesis in terms of future research but also for

management purposes, suggesting also that more research is required to increase the probability

of success of management plans.

Future research

The ecological importance of coral gardens is being acknowledged, as a consequence of studies

concerning the ecology and biology of these habitats. Because this is the first contribution on the

ecology and biology of gorgonians for Southern Portugal and the second for the country, many

aspects were not addressed at all and much work still needs to be done. However, it is expected

that the information of this thesis, contributing for the knowledge of gorgonian populations, shall

be used for management and future research.

Although in the Algarve coastal waters, fisheries have been thoroughly studied regarding

landings, fishing yield, by-catch and selectivity, mapping of the fishing intensity is not available.

Therefore, it was extremely difficult to predict the fishing pressure of each area. The observation

of lost fishing gears in a certain area, their quantity, diversity and degree of degradation; the

number of fishing boats (professional and amateur) in a certain area along time; fishing gear tracks,

provide indirect evidence of fishing intensity. However, these methods are extremely laborious,

time consuming and expensive. The monitoring of fishing vessels in real time using advanced

positioning systems (vessel tracking systems with GPS) would prove important to provide accurate

and updated information to be used for quantifying fishing pressure dynamics. A database of lost

fishing gears (date, coordinates, quantity, type) based on fishermen reports, and complemented by

other sources such as scuba diving centres and governmental agencies, would also allow to further

assess the threats to local populations. This data incorporated into GIS with multiple data sources

(landings, vessel data, habitat mapping) would be able to provide maps of use and intensity that

can be used for the management of the coast. This type of information is extremely important for

MPAs planning and design, but also for ecological studies dealing with impact assessment, namely

studies on damage assessment of gorgonians by fishing gears. It would also serve to discriminate

the effects of natural disturbance from those of fishing activities both in abundance and size-

frequency data.

216



CONCLUSIONS

On the other hand, climate change is probably one of the most challenging and important

issues concerning marine ecosystems (e.g. Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno, 2010). The effects of global

warming go beyond physiological adaptation of species and consequent shifts in the structure

of marine communities. Most certainly they will also result on changes in ocean and coastal

circulation patterns possibly affecting the connectivity between habitats due to reduced dispersal

of propagules. What is more, the chemical properties of sea water are changing, leading to

ocean acidification which is a major threat to several species and even to entire ecosystems, such

as coral reefs. Similarly to hard corals, many gorgonian species present calcium carbonate on

the form of calcite with an important function on their form and structure. The calcification

processes are changed by ocean acidification which may lead to changes in the physical properties

of gorgonians affecting, if not their survival, at least their ecological role, ultimately reducing

the biodiversity and resilience of habitats. In the last two decades, many benthic organisms,

including gorgonians have suffered mass mortalities attributed to increased sea temperature and

consequent disease outbreaks (e.g. Cerrano et al., 2000; Martin et al., 2002; Linares et al., 2005;

Bally and Garrabou, 2007). Therefore, continuous monitoring of sea water temperatures with high

spatial resolution (low cost temperature data loggers) would provide information on the spatial

and temporal variability (and possible causes) which could be used to make predictable models to

assess vulnerability of habitats, areas or species. Coastal water circulation models would be greatly

improved with such data, especially if complemented by other methodologies (Conductivity,

Temperature, and Depth, CTD sensors; Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers in areas of exceptional

complexity) and additional data (e.g. coast and seafloor morphology). Robust coastal circulation

models are extremely important for the implementation of MPA networks because connectivity is

strongly influenced by water circulation.

At last, transplantation methods using small colony fragments are one of the measures that can

be used in the future to restore the gorgonian populations affected by impacts (Rinkevich, 2000;

Shafir et al., 2006; Shaish et al., 2008). During a first attempt to address this issue, preliminary

results from transplantation experiments were not optimistic. Indeed, high mortality rates were

observed probably due to a mix of important factors such as: high temperatures during the

transplantation process as the experiment was conducted during the summer (August), and high

sedimentation in the transplantation site. In fact, one month after transplantation, more than half

of the transplanted fragments (42 transplants of 2 cm fragments of Eunicella gazella; 84 transplants

of Leptogorgia lusitanica of two size classes, 2 and 5 cm, 42 each) were alive and apparently in good

health (Figure C.2) even though some presented low levels of fouling by algae in the branch tips.

However, three months after transplantation more than 85 % of the transplants died (Figure C.2).

Some of the bases where the transplants were fixed were broken and the cables that hold them to

the artificial reefs were cut, probably as a consequence of bad weather that displaced a set of ghost

fishing traps that were found nearby. The remaining bases were completely covered with sediment

and most of the transplants that were still alive presented partial damage and extensive fouling.

CONCLUSIONS

These experiments could benefit from a better knowledge on the suitable conditions for

achieving acceptable survival rates (e.g. temperature threshold). This kind of information can be

obtained through controlled experiments in aquaria in relation to the physiology and biology of

gorgonians. Some examples are the effects of increased temperature on growth, stress, reproduct-

ive output, metabolism and feeding of gorgonians. They are also important to gain knowledge on

some aspects of the reproductive biology of gorgonians, such as spawning, fertilization and larval

development, otherwise only possible through difficult, laborious and expensive in situ studies. All

this information is missing for the most common and abundant gorgonian species of the Algarve.

However, it is of utmost importance to understand the full life cycle of these benthic organisms.

The results of such experiments can be used to build predictable models for future scenarios, as

is being done for other octocoral species such as Paramuricea clavata (Linares et al., 2007, 2008d)

and Corallium rubrum (Torrents et al., 2008). Furthermore, the use of gorgonians in restoration

efforts and harvesting for the industry of natural products (if they cannot be synthesized), involves

the sexual or asexual (vegetative) reproduction of gorgonians and their rearing to a suitable size

for transplantation or harvest, which greatly depends on the information regarding the life cycle of

the species.
