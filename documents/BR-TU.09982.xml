ABSTRACT
The purpose of this project was to develop a large capacity Li-ion battery for renewable energy storage, considering not only the performance but also the cost and safety related to the battery. Electrical batteries are devices in which chemical energy is stored and converted to electrical energy on demand through electrochemical reactions. They are composed by cells, which have three main parts: cathode, anode and electrolyte. In Li-ion batteries, lithium ions move from the anode through the electrolyte and reach the cathode during discharge and move back when charging. The materials chosen in the project were lithium iron phosphate for cathode due to its specifications and potential as an environmentally friendly material and graphite for anode because it is a widely studied and predictable material. A cost analysis for implementing the plant was made and it would cost MU$ 46,76 to build the plant and purchase the equipment (grass root plant cost). The annual operational cost would be MU$ 13,21. Battery's market price is settled in U$ 650,00 per set and the payoff time of the investment cost is 5 years.

RESUMO
Este projeto teve por objetivo desenvolver uma bateria de íon-lítio de alta capacidade para armazenamento de energia renovável, considerando não apenas sua performance, mas também seu custo e segurança. Baterias elétricas são dispositivos nos quais energia química é armazenada e convertida em energia elétrica sob demanda através de reações eletroquímicas. Estas são compostas de células e contêm três principais partes: catodo, anodo e eletrólito. Em baterias de íon-lítio, íons de lítio se movem através do eletrólito do anodo para o catodo durante a descarga da bateria e do catodo para o anodo durante a carga. Os materiais escolhidos no projeto foram fosfato de íon-lítio para o catodo devido às suas especificações e sua potencial sustentabilidade e grafite para o anodo pois este é um material amplamente estudado e previsível. Foi desenvolvida uma análise de custo para implementação da planta de produção e sua construção e aquisição de equipamentos teria um custo de MU$ 46,76. O custo operacional anual seria de MU$13,21. O preço de mercado da bateria está definido em U$ 650,00 por set e o tempo de retorno do custo de investimento é de 5 anos.

1.	INTRODUCTION
The energy produced from non-renewable sources is a deliberate threat to sustainability, especially due to the emission of greenhouse gases. Thus, it is important to develop devices that are compatible with the need of establishing a sustainable and environmental friendly community. Society, then, must make major changes to its energy supply and utilization systems. [1]
Batteries are devices that contain two electrodes with different chemical potentials connected by a conductive material, the electrolyte. Electrons flow spontaneously from the more negative electrode to the more positive electrode when the battery is connected to an external device. Ions are transported through the electrolyte and then the electrical energy produced can be tapped by the external circuit. Hundreds of electrochemical couples were proposed during the 19th and early 20th centuries. [2]
Regarding to the battery production itself, there are safety concerns about runaway reactions which can lead to fires, explosions or internal short-circuits. Therefore, improvements in monitoring and management are essential in Lithium-ion batteries to fulfil their potential in the automotive market. Lithium-ion batteries would also need to reduce their carbon footprint. If Lithium-ion batteries are to take place as the batteries of the future, its demand is also concerning. Lithium is found in mines and also in unlimited quantities in sea water. Lithium extraction from brines is much greener (requiring just solar energy) than conventional mining. The demand for lithium could also be eased by recycling. [2]
In secondary or rechargeable batteries, a larger voltage applied in the opposite direction can cause the battery to recharge. Not all the batteries are developed equally: nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries, for example, need to be fully discharged, otherwise they quickly lose capacity due to a widely known fact called memory effect. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, contrariwise, have a long life and do not suffer with memory effects. Those batteries operate at higher voltages, have smaller sizes and hold the charge more efficiently. Most of the high-quality portable devices manufactured nowadays profit from this technology. [3]
Li-ion batteries have, as main advantages, a high energy density, low self-discharge, low maintenance and high current. Those aspects are to be described more effectively through the next section.
The purpose of this project was to develop a large capacity Li-ion battery for renewable energy storage, considering not only the performance but also the cost and safety related to the
battery. The challenge was to find the best Lithium-ion battery compound (in terms of deepcycling capability, cost and sustainability) suitable for renewable energy applications.
2.	LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1	BATTERY
Electrical batteries are devices in which chemical energy is stored and converted to electrical energy on demand through electrochemical reactions. They are composed by cells, which have three main parts: cathode, anode and electrolyte, which will be detailed separately through this section. Cathode and anode can be both referred as half-cells and they cannot have contact with each other, so the presence of a separator is necessary [4].
Batteries can be classified in two forms: primary and secondary. Primary batteries can only be used once, while secondary batteries (rechargeable batteries) can be charged and discharged multiple times. Secondary batteries are used in portable devices, light vehicles and many other applications [4].
Redox reactions are responsible for generating power in a battery. Anions in the anode are oxidized and its electrons flows through the electrolyte and cations present in the cathode absorb those electrons. This generates the electricity until one electrode runs out of the substances necessary for the redox reaction. The charge is conducted to the outside of the battery and through the load by the collector [4].
The electrical driving force across the cell is the terminal voltage, measured in volts (V). The terminal voltage in a charging cell is always smaller in magnitude than the theoretical voltage, while it exceeds the theoretical voltage when charging due to the internal resistance. An ideal battery does not exhibit internal resistance [4].
In Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, lithium ions move from the anode to the cathode during discharge and move back when charging, as it can be seen in Figure 1.
CHARGING	DISCHARGING
Figure 1. Charge and discharge processes in a Li-ion battery.
The currently used cathode lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) has a low-medium cost, but cobalt is toxic, compromising the safety of the battery. The current graphite (carbon) anode has low prices and is relatively safe although it has a low theoretical capacity compared to other potential materials. Due to those constrains, new electrodes are being developed. Different electrodes will be described further in this section [4].
2.2	CATHODE
A cathode, also known as the positive pole, is a positively charged electrode. Due to this charge, the electrons flow into it when redox reactions occur, which means that a reduction occurs in this half-cell [5].
2.3	ANODE
An anode, also known as the negative pole, is a negatively charged electrode. Thus, existing electrons in this electrode flow towards to the cathode, which means that the direction of electric current is opposite to the direction of electric flow [5].
2.4	ELECTROLYTE
When electrodes are placed in an electrolyte and a voltage is applied, the electrolyte will conduct electricity. They are necessary to guarantee the flow of electrons, due to the fact that their ions neutralize positive and negative charges from cathode and anode, respectively.
The most common electrolyte is LiPF6 in organic solution. There are more efficient electrolytes in market, but this has still the best cost-benefit [5].
2.5	C-RATE
In describing batteries, discharge current is often expressed as a C-rate, which is a measure of the rate at which a battery is discharged relative to its maximum capacity. A 1C-rate expresses, then, the capacity of the battery in one hour [5].
For instance, if a battery has a nominal capacity of 500mAh, the current corresponding to a C-rate of 10 (10C) and a charge or discharge time of 6 minutes would be 5000mA. The current corresponding to a C-rate of 1/2 and a charge or discharge time of 2 hours would be 250mA [5].
2.6	DEPTH OF DISCHARGE (DOD)
DoD is the amount of battery capacity that has been discharged expressed as a percentage of maximum capacity [5].
2.7	CYCLE LIFE
Cycle life is the number of discharge/charge cycles the battery can experience before it fails. The higher the DOD, the lower the cycle life [5].
2.8	NOMINAL CAPACITY (Ah)
Nominal capacity is the total Ampere-hours available when the battery is discharged at a certain discharge current (C-rate) from 100% state-of-charge to the minimum allowable voltage. It can be calculated by multiplying the discharge current and the discharge time. The increase of C-rate leads to a decreasing of the nominal capacity [5].
2.9	NOMINAL ENERGY (Wh)
Nominal energy is the total Watt-hours available when the battery is discharged at the C-rate from 100% state-of-charge to the minimum allowable voltage. It can be calculated by multiplying the discharge power and the discharge time. The increase of C-rate leads to a decreasing of the nominal energy [3].
The nominal energy per unit volume (in Wh/L) is often called energy density while the nominal energy per unit mass (in Wh/kg) is often called gravimetric energy density. Both are characteristics of the battery chemistry and packaging [3].
2.10	LI-ION BATTERY POSSIBILITIES [6]

2.10.1	LITHIUM COBALT OXIDE (LiCoO2)
LiCoO2 is a chemical compound widely used in the manufacturing of Li-ion batteries.
As can be seen in Figure 2, its crystalline structure consists of lithium ions that lie between oxygen-cobalt slabs.
When assembled in a battery, it consists of a cobalt oxide cathode and a graphite carbon anode, becoming then the most commonly used battery for high-end consumer products.
Figure 2. Li-cobalt structure. [6]
It is of high interest its high specific energy, which makes it good for mobile phones, laptops and digital cameras. However, it has a short life span and limited load capability (specific power), as well as the incapability to discharge in higher rates than 1C. A wider insight of its advantages and drawbacks can be seen in Figure 3.
The axis ‘performance’ demonstrates the influence of the temperature on a lithium cobalt oxide cathode: how is the performance when the temperature is low or high.
The axis safety represents risk of overheating followed by explosion, which may be caused by flaws on the assembly, calculations or raw material choices,
Figure 3. .Snapshot of an average Li-cobalt battery. [6]
2.10.2	LITHIUM MANGANESE OXIDE (LiMn2O4)
It is a lithium-manganese-oxide based material with a spinel structure. It consists of a 3D framework in which lithium ions are placed, as can be seen in Figure 4.
Its field of use comprises power tools, medical instruments, as well as hybrid and electric vehicles. Most modern manganese-based Li-ion systems include a blend of nickel and cobalt.
Between its strengths there is a high thermal stability and enhanced safety, as well as a lower internal resistance. In addition, lithium manganese oxide is a non-expensive and nontoxic compound. Design flexibility allows engineers to maximize the battery for either optimal longevity (life span), maximum load current (specific power) or high capacity (specific energy) [7].
On the other hand, its most important drawbacks are a limited cycle and calendar life, and a lower capability than LiCoO2 (Figure 5).
Figure 5. Snapshot of a pure Li-manganese battery. [6]
2.10.3	LITHIUM IRON PHOSPHATE (LiFePO4)
Lithium Iron Phosphate, also known as LFP, has an olivine crystal structure. It is a nanoscale phosphate cathode material. A zigzag 3D framework is formed by oxygen-iron octahedral sharing common corners with phosphate tetrahedral, as can be seen in Figure 6. Lithium ions are placed within the octahedral channels in a zigzag structure [8].
Figure 6. Lithium Iron Phosphate structure. [6]
This compound has a good electrochemical performance with low resistance, enhanced safety, good thermal stability, high current rating and long cycle life, and it is tolerant to abuse. It has a lower specific energy, cold temperatures reduce its performance, and elevated storage temperature shortens its service life (Figure 7) [6], [8].
Figure 7.Snapshot of a typical Li-phosphate battery. [6]
2.10.4	LITHIUM NICKEL MANGANESE COBALT OXIDE (LiNiMnCoO2)
LiNiMnCoO2, also known as NMC, is the battery of choice for power tools and powertrains for vehicles. Nickel is known for its high specific energy but low stability; manganese has the benefit of forming a spinel structure to achieve very low internal resistance but offers a low specific energy. The combination of these metals brings out the best of each [6], [7].
A schematic structure of NMC is shown in Figure 8 below.
Figure 8. NMC structure. [6]

In the performance of the compound as a cathode, it is possible to highlight its great
specific energy and low self-heating rate, as it can be seen in Figure 9. Contrarily, it is difficult
to find the right balance between nickel and manganese in order to offer the best performance,
as manufacturers try to keep the secret of their formulas [6].
Figure 9. Snapshot of NMC. [6]
2.10.5	LITHIUM NICKEL COBALT ALUMINIUM OXIDE (LiNiCoAlO2)
This kind of cathode is less commonly used, but the automotive industry is getting interested in it [6]. It presents a high specific energy, high power densities and long life span. However, its cost is relatively high and its level of safety is considerably low (Figure 10).
Figure 10. Snapshot of NCA. [6]
2.10.6	LITHIUM TITANATE (Li^isOn)
Li4Ti5Oi2 replace graphite in the anode of a typical Li-ion battery and it has a spinel structure, as can be seen in Figure 11 below.
Figure 11. Li4Ti5Oi2 structure. [6]
Its performance in a battery presents a fast-charge, a delivery of high discharge current,
higher cycle count, good level of safety, and an excellent low temperature discharge (Figure
12). Although it also has some drawbacks, as low specific energy, which makes it expensive
[6].
Figure 12. Snapshot of Li-titanate. [6]
Lithium-polymer differs from other battery systems in the type of electrolyte used. It can be built on many systems, such as LiCoO2, NMC, LiFePO4 and LiMn2O4 and works exactly the same way as a normal Li-ion compound. Also, it has a higher specific energy, and can be manufactured in thinner sheets. However, its cost is significantly higher (around 30% more).
2.10.8	SOLID ELECTROLYTE WITH LITHIUM-METAL BATTERIES
This alternative has higher energy density, yet it presents safety issues, it provides low cycles, and its commercialization is estimated to be possible in around 10 years [2].
After the analysis above, and as the cathode has a bigger and faster degradation, it was decided to focus on it. Thus, by working on the durability itself, other qualities are also improved at the same time. If a high durability cathode is found, then it makes sense to think it will be environmentally friendly, because it will take more time to it to be changed by a brand new battery and so the use of materials will be lower.
2.11	USAGE OF NANOMATERIALS IN ELECTRODES
At the nanoscale, properties of the materials can change from properties at macro or micro scale. Due to this, nanomaterials gained attention from all fields [7].
Solid-state ion diffusion in bulk electrode materials is slow and thus, limits the charge and discharge rate. In order to overcome this, nanoscale electrodes are used, reducing the path lengths and resulting in a fast diffusion [7].
2.12	LiFiPO4 AS CATHODE IN LI-ION BATTERY
LiFePO4 has a low electronic and ionic conductivity. Thus, to use it as a viable cathode material for Li-ion batteries, it is necessary to improve its electrochemical properties, which is done integrating these two methods: nanostructured material and carbon covered material [8].
The proposed LiFePO4 has a good electrochemical performance at nano-scale, enhanced safety, good thermal stability, tolerant to abuse and long life cycle (between 2000 and 5000 cycles with 80% DoD) [8].
As silicon has a high specific charging capacity (around ten times higher than graphite) and a low discharge potential, it is an interesting alternative for anode. Silicon is not used yet due to its volume expansion in around 400% [9].
Nanowires could improve silicon's properties by increasing the amount of available surface area in contact with the electrolyte, thereby increasing anode's power density and allowing faster charging and higher current delivery. Also, when grown in current collector they are able to reduce the problems associated with the volume expansion [9].
Furthermore, carbon layers are usually the support for the silicon nanowires (and many other nanostructures), which improves the stability of the anode by buffering the massive volume change during cycles. It also provides satisfactory electrical contacts [9].
Silicon nanowires have a theoretical capacity of roughly 4.2mAh g-1 and a capacity retention of 89% of the initial capacity after 200 cycles [9].
Doping impurities to the nanowire anode improves the battery performance, and it study has proven that phosphorus doped silicon nanowires have the possibility of sustaining an 85% of initial capacity after cycling over 6000 times [9].
As information regarding to silicon nanowires is not easily available, all the cost analysis for the battery was made considering the use of graphite as the anode.
From the process diagram below (Erro! Fonte de referência não encontrada.), a more detailed study on each equipment needed for battery manufacturing was made. Calculations were based on a daily production of 10 000 cells per day (value estimated according to SAFT AB production [10]). It is a batch and the cost estimation was mainly based on supply companies. The battery should last 5000 cycles with 80% DoD and have a power performance of 55kWh.
Due to the power requirements of the battery, a large number of cells is needed. Therefore, it was chosen to manufacture a pouch cell in order to save up space when stocking them together.
Contamination between anode and cathode materials ruins the battery, so great care must be taken to prevent these materials from getting in contact with each other. Therefore, anodes and cathodes are usually processed in different rooms, which means that even if the same equipment is used to produce both electrodes, more than one equipment is needed in the production line.
There are many different strategies developed to manufacture a battery. The choice of procedure adopted through this section was made by analysing the availability of the equipment (based on its specifications) and raw materials required for the manufacturing. Thus, it was decided to follow the instructions of a company that explains the assembly and sells the equipment. By following barely one procedure, the calculation related to design (sizes and capacities) of each equipment and raw material demanded becomes more practical and realistic. Similar procedures were studied and can be seen through references [11], [12] and [13].
The following explanation, then, is based on the procedure described by MTI Corporation [14]. The equipment (and its prices and characteristics) used for further calculation are also from this company.

A vacuum mixer is used for a high accurate mixing, not depending on the environmental conditions. For battery production, a high accuracy is desired, once a poorly mixed material for the electrodes can cause great variations on the energy storage capacity and life cycles.
Paste mixing means blending together solid and liquid materials in order to form a paste. This paste is the most important component in the battery, the positive and negative electrodes.

3.2.2	COATER ATTACHED TO HEATER
Purpose: coat the paste to current collector and dry it.
Coating is a covering that is applied to the surface of an object.

The role of these current collectors is to transfer electric current to and from the battery terminals during discharge and charge processes, and once coated with the paste, are referred as positive and negative plates.
The drying process is necessary to prevent any moisture in the electrodes. If water is present, the number of cycles can reduce significantly, once the moisture interferes in the attachment of the paste in the collector.

3.2.3	ROLLING PRESS (CALENDER)
Purpose: roll the electrode to proper thickness.
The electrode thickness and homogeneous distribution on the collector are very important for the battery parameters, such as rate capability, energy and power density and long-term cycling. There is a severe capacity loss at higher rate for thicker electrodes as well as a significant loss of power density and deterioration of long-term cycling performance. A non-homogeneous distribution causes a high-density area that charges and discharges faster, reducing considerably the number of cycles of the battery.
Compressing the electrode minimizes the porosity therefore increase the power density.

Process
In an ultrasonic welding machine, high-frequency ultrasonic acoustic vibrations are locally applied to work pieces being held together under pressure to create a solid-state weld.
The benefits of ultrasonic welding are that it is much faster than conventional adhesives or solvents. The drying time is very quick, and the pieces do not need to remain in a jig for long periods of time waiting for the j oint to dry or cure. The welding can easily be automated, making clean and precise joints; the site of the weld is very clean and rarely requires any touch-up work.

Figure 22. Wattmeter [14].
Process
The purpose of a short-circuit test is to determine the series branch parameters of the equivalent circuit of a real transformer. It is conducted on the high-voltage side of the transformer and the low-voltage side is short circuited, which means that a voltmeter, ammeter and wattmeter are on the high-voltage side of the circuit.
The supply voltage required to circulate current through the transformer is usually very small. Also, the core losses are very small because applied voltage is only a few percentage of the nominal voltage and hence can be neglected. Thus the wattmeter reading measures only the full load copper loss, which gives values approximately equivalent to the resistance and reactance of the transformer. It is estimated that 0.5% of the electrodes are recycled.

4.	MATERIAL BALANCE
The production of Li-ion batteries uses expensive raw materials and thus, losses in the process should be minimized to achieve a low cost per battery. In order to analyse the cost involved in the process, a material balance needs to be done.
The battery production is described in the diagram already presented in Erro! Fonte de referência não encontrada.. The cells are produced individually and then assembled in a larger battery.
The material balance was made considering a production of 10 000 cells per day based on a smaller/medium production. It was chosen to do the calculations with a high amount of cells to estimate the costs of production in a larger scale. In other words, to check the profitability of a real production. It was set that the cells produced have the following specifications (Table 20):
Table 20. Battery cells specifications.
Battery s	pecification - per cell	
Current	5 000	mAh
Capacity	16,5	Wh
Voltage	3,3	V
As it was stated in the introduction, the battery set should fulfil voltage and capacity requirements as shown in Table 21 below:
Table 21. Battery set specifications.
Battery specification - per set		
Capacity	27,5	kWh
Voltage	48	V
Cells should be assembled in a way to meet the set specifications. When cells are arranged in series, the voltage is increased by the sum of the voltages of each cell in series; if they are arranged in parallel, the capacity is increased by the sum of the capacities of each cell in parallel. Thus, it is necessary to have a series and parallel arrangement to increase both voltage and capacity and then fulfil the set specifications. For each parallel arrangement, a complete series is necessary and the total number of cells is obtained by multiplying parallel with series requirements. Equations and results are presented below:
• For the series arrangement:
Vset
For the parallel arrangement:
^parallel
capacityset =
capacity^11
i
• The total number of cells is given by:
total number of cell = Nparauei x Nseries
The results obtained that fulfil our specifications are presented in Table 22 below:
Table 22 Number of cells needed per set.
Number of cells needed per set		
Parallel	114,583	115
Series	14,545	15
Total	1 666,667	1 725
Thus, the total number of cells required per set is 1725 cells, with 115 rows and 15 cells in each row.
4.1.	MASS OF ACTIVE MATERIAL
The amount of active material per cells can be obtained by the specific capacity of each material (cathode and anode). For LiFePO4 the specific capacity is 170 mAh/g and for graphite the specific capacity is 372 mAh/g. Thus, in order to achieve the capacity of 5000 mAh for each cell, the amount of necessary material can be obtained by simply dividing the capacity of the cell by the specific capacity of the battery. The obtained results are presented in Table 23 below:
Table 23. Amount of necessary active material per cell.
Amount of Active material
Cathode	Specific energy		Per cell (g)
LiFePO4 (nano)	170,000	mAh/g	29,412
	8,160	Wh/g	
Anode			
Graphite	372,000	mAh/g	13,441
	17,856	Wh/g	
The amount of other materials in the cell, such as binders and solvents are based on the amount of active material in the cell.
For the cathode, the mass fraction of LiFePO4 is 93.5% of the total mass of the mixture. For the anode, the mass fraction of graphite is 94.5% of the total mass of the mixture. Based on this and on the amount of active material calculated above is possible to obtain the total mass of the mixture and consequently the amount of the other components. It is shown below the mixture for the cathode and the anode.
Cathode:
-	LiFePO4: 93.5%

The physical data of each material is presented in the Appendix. Considering the production of 10 000 cells per day the total amount of material necessary per day is (Table 25):
Table 25. Mass of Material needed for 1 day ofproduction.

The amount of material necessary per day is used as a base for the material balance calculations. As it is explained in ‘Battery manufacture: Process and equipment’ section above, the process for cathode and anode preparations are made separately and after ready an assembling process is needed. The mass balance presented in this report focuses on the preparation process, since the battery composition remain constant after assembling. The balance was calculated for cathode and anode individually. For the calculations of the mass balance some assumption were made, such as efficiencies and losses in each equipment. The complete calculation and tables of results are presented in the Appendix.
4.2.	CATHODE MATERIAL BALANCE
The material for the cathode (LiFePO4) is supplied in form of nanoparticles and ready for the paste preparation. In the first step, a mixing of the active material with the binder (PVDF), conductive material (Super C-45) and solvent (NMP) is necessary to form the cathode paste. Losses were estimated in 2% [17] due to paste’s consistency, which tends to stick inside the mixer. Table 26 below shows the outlet stream from the mixer. The feed of raw materials is made in individual streams.
Stream 5					
	Mass (kg/day)	Solid Mass fraction	Mass fraction	Vol (m3/day)	Vol Fraction
LiFePO4	288,235	0,935	0,610	0,096	0,282

Total mass	472,685		1,000	0,341	1,000
After leaving the mixer, the paste is ready to be coated on the current collector. In the case of the cathode, the current collector is an aluminium foil. Losses on the coating were estimated as 1% due to the tendency of sticking inside the equipment. Also, losses of volatile compounds and arrested particles are considered since it is a coater with a heater attached to it in order to prevent moisture in the electrode. The amount of arrested particles was estimated in 1% and the volatile compounds (solvent) losses were estimated in 10%. Thus, there are two outlet streams from the coating: exhausted gases and coated electrode. Table 27 and Table 28 below show the calculation results of the outlet stream for the cathode coating and the coating/heater exhausted gases stream.
Table 27. Outlet stream from the coating process for the cathode production on LiFePOfGraphite Lithium ion Battery at 140°C and 1bar.

The volumetric daily flow was calculated using the density of each material at the Normal Pressure and Condition (NTP) and it was necessary to determine the length of aluminium foil that should be used as a current collector.
The total volumetric daily flow is 0.318 m3/day. Considering a coating thickness of 150 um. is possible to obtain the area covered by the coating. As an aluminium foil with a constant width is used, the length of the foil can be simply obtained dividing the coating area by the width of the foil, as shown in the equation below:
A
f ___ ^coating
Lai =

Table 29 shows the calculations and assumptions of the calculation in the aluminium foil length.
Table 29. Aluminium foil length calculations.
Aluminium Foil calculations	
Coating Thickness	150 pm
Coating Area	2120 m2
Aluminium foil width	0,28 m
Using the volumetric calculations, the equation above and considering slithering losses of 2%, the necessary length of the Aluminium foil is 7720 m/day.
After the coating, the cathode is calendered to form a uniform layer and a slithering process is followed. For each of this process, losses of 2% were applied. The outlet stream from the slithering is presented on Table 30 below:
LiFePOfGraphite Lithium ion Battery at 25°C and 1bar.

After slithering, cathode is winded together with the separator and anode. Further, a sequence of assembling, testing and drying process is made. The drying process does not change the composition in the battery, it is mainly responsible for keeping it dry from moisture in the air. Some of the assembling and testing process are held in a drying room.
4.3.	ANODE MATERIAL BALANCE
The active material for the anode graphite is supplied in form of raw graphite, which needs a pretreatment in a furnace and windmill. After the pretreatment, graphite is mixture with the binder (CMC and SBR), conductive material (Super P) and solvent (di-H2O), forming the anode's paste. Mixer losses were estimated as 2% due to stick inside the equipment [17]. Table 31 presents the outlet stream for anode's mixer.

After mixing, the paste is ready to be coated on the current collector. In the anode's case, the current collector is a copper foil. Losses on the coating were estimated as 1% due to stick inside the equipment. Moreover, losses of volatile compounds and arrested particles are
59
considered since it is a coater with a heater attached to it in order to prevent moisture in the electrode. Particles arrested were estimated in 1% and the volatile compounds (solvent) losses were estimated in 15% [17]. The volatile compound losses are higher for the anode since water (anode's solvent) is more volatile than NMP (cathode's solvent). As in the coating process on the cathode, there are also two outlet stream from the coating for the anode, the exhausted gases and the coated electrode. Table 32 and Table 33 below show the calculation results of the outlet stream for the anode coating and the coating/heater exhausted gases stream.

The calculation of the volumetric daily flow presented in Table 33 was made by using the density of each material at the Normal Pressure and Condition (NTP) and it was used to determine the length of the copper foil that should be used as a current collector. The calculations steps to calculate the length of the copper foil are the same as used in the cathode's aluminium foil. Table 34 shows the calculations and assumptions for the copper foil length.
Copper foil calculations	
Coating Thickness	150 pm
Coating Area	1440 m2
Copper foil width	0,28 m
Using the data in Table 32 and Table 33 and considering slithering losses of 2%, the necessary length of the Copper foil is 5 130 m/day.
After coating, anode is calendared to form a uniform layer and then a slithering process is followed, the same as it is for cathode. For each of this process, losses of 2% were applied. The outlet stream from the slithering process for the anode is presented in Table 35:

The total purchase cost is then obtained by the sum of all purchase cost from the equipment. Finally, the total investment cost or grass root plant cost is obtained by multiplying the total purchase cost by a factor [17] that takes into account direct and indirect costs, such as auxiliaries, installation, building for the process and engineering. The grass root plant cost for this project is M$46,76 (Table 37).
Table 37. Grass root plant cost.

5.2.	OPERATING COST
5.2.1.	MATERIAL COST
The costs for each material necessary for the battery are described in Table 38.

All materials will be purchased in bulk quantities.
The total material cost is then presented in Table 39 below. The price per day is
$15.096,23 and the total annual price is $4.530.000.
Table 39 Total material cost.
Total Price ($/day)	15096,23
Total annual price (M$/year)	4,53
Silicon nano wires are not being produced in large scales, therefore there are no available prices yet. Although it is a promising material for the battery, it is not possible to know how much it will affect the price.
5.2.2.	OPERATOR COST
The operator cost is based on the rule of thumbs for cost estimation. Its calculation is made as shown below:
annual cost = salary number of workers per s ift number of s ifts
Some assumptions are needed, such as:
•	Supervision for operators: 15% on annual cost.
•	Laboratory work: 25% on annual cost.
•	License fees: 6% on total annual cost (considered in the total operation cost).
Considering 5 shifts with 8 operators in each and an average salary of $3.000, the annual operator cost is M$ 2,1.
5.2.3.
STORAGE COST
5.2.3.1. FEEDSTOCK
The annual cost can be calculated by using the equation below:
annual cost = Q fA P D/365
Where Q = annual consumption/production (ton/year), fA is a factor [17], P = cost/income per ton (SEK/ton), D = days of storage.
The feedstock storage cost per year is then presented in Table 40 below.
Table 40. Values for calculating the feedstock storage cost.

			Total storage cost ($/year)		74447,14
5.2.3.2.	PRODUCT
The equation used for calculating the product storage cost is the same as used for calculating feedstock storage cost. In order to calculate the product storage cost, some assumptions are used:
•	The storage cost of one battery is $ 200/kWh.
•	5 batteries sets are produced per day.
•	30 days of storage.
•	$ 650/kWh is the battery price.
Storage costs product

Battery	1500,00	17875,00	30	0,20	440753,42
The product storage cost is $440.753, 42 per year.
5.2.4.	MAINTENANCE COST
The maintenance cost is obtained by multiplying the grass root plant cost by a factor, 8% [17]. Then, the maintenance cost is M$3,74.
5.2.5.	SPARE PARTS
The spare parts cost is obtained by multiplying the maintenance cost by a factor, 5% [17]. Then, the spare parts cost is $112.225,15.
5.2.6.	ELECTRICITY COST
The electricity cost is based on the usage of electricity of equipment already exposed in ‘Battery manufacture: Process and equipment' section above. Equipment such as calender, slitting and winding machines are doubled in order to increase the speed of production and to guarantee that it will not stop if one of the equipment needs to be repaired. Table 42 below shows the power requirement for each equipment.
Table 42. Equipment power consumption.
Equipment	Number of Eq.	Power (W)	Total Power (W)

The price of energy is then calculated based on the electricity price in Sweden, April 2015. As it is presented o Table 43, the energy consumption is 657,86 kWh/day and the total annual energy cost is $6.986,58.
Table 43. Total energy cost.

Electrical efficiency	0,90
Total Power (W)	27388,89

Total energy cost (SEK/day)	197,36
Total energy cost ($/day)	23,29
Total energy cost ($/year)	6986,58
The electricity cost includes also the dry room operational cost, which is based on the assumption that its daily cost is $200. The dry room operational cost is $1.440.000 per year.
The total electricity cost is then $1.446.986,58 per year.
5.2.7.	TOTAL OPERATING COST
The total operating cost (Table 44) is calculated based on the sum of the operating costs described above and taking into account the licence fees cost (a factor of 6% of the operating cost [17], as mentioned in the ‘Operator cost’ section above).
Table 44. Total operating cost.

License fees ($/year)	628839,29
Total Operating Annual cost ($/year)	13205625,10
5.3.	PAYOFF METHOD
The payoff method is used for estimating the time (in years) needed for receiving the investment money in return.
The numbers of years is calculated by using the equation below:
/ln(1	G X/af)\
n ( ln(1+X)	)
Where n = number of years, G = grass root plant cost, X = interest rate, at = income = selling price	operating cost.
Considering the selling product specifications on Table 45 and parameters values for the equation above shown in Table 46, the payoff time obtained is 5 years.
Table 45. Selling product specifications.
Selling product specifications	
Selling price per battery ($/kWh)	650
Battery storage capacity (kWh/set)	27,5
Number of batteries per day (set/day)	5
Number of batteries per year (set/year)	1500
Battery selling price ($/set)	17875,00
Table 46. Parameter values for payoff method.
Grass roots cost ($)	4,68E+07
Interest rate	0,15
Operating cost ($/year)	1,32E+07
Revenue from batteries ($/year)	2,68E+07
Income per year ($/year)	1,36E+07
Payoff time (year)	5,18
This payoff time obtained is reasonable if compared with average payoff time of new industrial plants [17]. If the battery price is decreased, the payoff time increases, so a sensitivity analysis was made in order to evaluate some uncertain parameters in the payoff calculation.
5.4.	SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Sensitivity analysis are usually carried out in order to evaluate uncertain parameters in a mathematical model or in a cost model. The assumptions made during the cost estimation can 67
significantly change the product final cost. Thus, it is very important to evaluate the impact of deviations on your expectations and how is their influence in the payoff time.
Initially, a breakdown of the costs was made for a better overview of the cost influence. In Figure 31 it can be seen the relation between the investment cost (equipment cost) and the operational cost annually. As expected, the initial cost of the industry is much higher than the operation cost, since purchase of equipment and installations cost can be expensive.
Breakdown of costs
■ Equipment cost ■ Operational cost
Figure 31. Breakdown of costs.
As the operational costs include different types of cost in it, a breakdown of all the operational costs was made (Figure 32). It can be seen that the material cost is responsible for 36% of the total operation cost. Other major costs are maintenance, labour expenses and electricity. In order to reduce operational costs, the main focus should be on reducing the materials prices and labour expenses, since maintenance and electricity are more inflexible costs.
Figure 32. Inside operational cost.
The major material costs are LiFePO4 and di-H2O. LiFePO4 is supplied ready for the cathode paste production, however an analysis can be made for a raw lithium material be supplied and auxiliaries’ facilities produce LiFePO4 particles and a lower price can be obtained. Another approach can be obtain a lower price from another supplier. For the di-H2O, it can be easily produced inside the factory, since the equipment to produce deionized water are quite common and usually not expensive.
In order to analyse the influence of the materials cost in the payoff time, a sensitivity analysis was performed. The materials cost was swept in -40%, -20%, -10%, 10%, 20% and 40% of the current considered material cost. It is possible to see in Figure 33 that the reduction of this cost will not play an expressive role in the decreasing of the payoff time.

Another analysis takes into account the influence of the battery price in the payoff time.
The results are shown in Figure 34 below.

Figure 34. Battery price sensitivity analysis.
The battery selling price plays an important role on the payoff time. The choice of the price is strongly related to the market price, so this factor should be taken into account when deciding a real price for the battery. The chosen value, $650/kWh, is reasonable in terms of market price and payoff time, but its decrease would turn the battery into a more competitive
product. It is important to observe that the decrease of the battery price leads to an exponential increase of the payoff time.
As a further sensitivity analysis, the number of cells produced per day could be changed, in order to evaluate the impact of a smaller or bigger production in the battery price, payoff time and operational costs.
6.	RECYCLING CONSIDERATIONS
Besides all environmental benefits of recycling, there are some potential economic reasons for it. It often pays off to recover the materials since the disposal is quite costly.
For safety, most processes uses techniques to reduce the activity of the components. Two major processes are known for that, the first involves calcining to bake out the electrolyte which deactivates the cells and allows the disassembly. The second uses cryogenic process to reduce the reactivity of the constituents [47], [48]. This second process is largely used and therefore will be described here.
The batteries are chilled to -325F in liquid nitrogen, and then are sheared into three pieces in a caustic bath, which neutralizes any acidic components and dissolves the lithium salts. The salts are precipitated and dewatered in filter presses and then used to produce lithium carbonate. Hydrogen and organics burn off at the surface of the process bath. The remaining large pieces are passed through a hammer mill, after which ferrous and nonferrous metals are recovered. Plastics and paper float to the top and are recovered for disposal or recycling. The carbon sludge is filtered out and collected as a cake. Materials are stored in bunkers and fumes are scrubbed. Next, the remainder is crushed and sifted, and hydrometallurgical processes are used to separate the metallic components. The process recovers steel or aluminium containers, copper and aluminium support, lithium hydroxides, and carbon. It is unclear how carbon is recovered as a saleable product, but since no Nickel or Cobalt are used, the process is feasible [47].
Recycling of large batteries is much easier than recycling of small consumer cells, the collection logistics are straightforward, the batteries will be large enough to warrant separation by type to maximize the value of the recovered materials and there is enough material in fairly large pieces to justify at least partial disassembly [47].
7.	CONCLUSIONS
The materials choice in this project was made considering environmental relevant aspects, such as safety and the absence of heavy metals in the composition, as well as capacity of storage and availability for production.
As nanowires are still under research, information for industrial production was not available. Another option for this electrode is graphite, because it is widely used, it is cheap and has suitable properties.
A cost analysis was performed considering the industrial production process of a Li-ion battery using raw materials and equipment available in the market. The grass root total cost was M$46,76 and the annual operation cost is M$13,21. A payoff method was applied and the payoff time obtained was 5 years.
After some parametric sweeping, it was possible to conclude that the materials cost does not have an expressive influence in the payoff time. However, the selling price of the battery plays an important role, resulting in a range of 13 years between the cheapest ($500/kWh) and the most expensive ($800/kWh) prices. Thus, it is possible to conclude that it would be interesting to sell the battery for $650/kWh just as it was used as a consideration in the beginning of chapter 4.
The industry designed in this project is economically feasible for the price range mentioned above, depending mainly on a considerable initial investment.
