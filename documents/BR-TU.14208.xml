ABSTRACT 

  

The aim of the present work was to obtain a neutral lipids fraction of microalgae free of polar 

lipids (i.e., phospholipids and glycolipids) to produce biodiesel and, at the same time, get 

phospholipids and glycolipids rich fractions as value added products under a biorefinery 

approach. To achieve this objective, ethanolic extracts of the wet biomass (70.0%, w/w) of two 

microalgal strains (Nannochloropsis oculata and Phaeodactylum tricornutum) were prepared 

and partitioned into three fractions, namely hexane, colloidal and water fractions, using a binary 

solvent mixture (hexane + water), employing a new process called as Liquid Tri-phase System 

(LTPS). HPLC-ELSD was used to analyse the lipid classes and GC-MS to assess the fatty acid 

profiles. N. oculata had an ethanolic extract yield of 38.2% (w/w, dry weight) and P. 

tricornutum of 30.3%. Lipid class distribution (% w/w, total lipids) of N. oculata was 45.1, 22.1 

and 32.8 for neutral lipids, glycolipids and phospholipids, respectively; and for P. tricornutum 

it was 23.2, 49.1 and 27.7, respectively. When the LTPS process was applied, lipid distribution 

was: hexane (27.4%), colloidal (53.4%) and water (19.2%) for N. oculata; and 30.6, 55.4, and 

14.0% for P. tricornutum. The colloidal phases in both strains contain more than 23.0% 

glycolipids and 68.0% phospholipids. HPLC-ELSD confirmed that the neutral lipids fraction 

was obtained free of glycolipids and phospholipids. The fatty acids composition showed that 

the neutral lipids fraction or hexane phase of the LTPS is suitable for biodiesel production as it 

contains more than 83.0% of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, which are less prone 

to oxidation compared to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Additionally, a colloidal phase 

fraction rich in glycolipids, that can be converted into biosurfactants, and phospholipids that 

can be processed as liposomes, aquaculture feed or infant formula additives as it is enriched in 

eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or other long chain poly unsaturated fatty acids, was obtained.

RESUMO 

 

Factores associados aos combustíveis fósseis como os fortes impactos ambientais, incerteza de 

aprovisionamento energético e ainda necessidade de reduzir o consumo de energia, têm levado 

a uma procura por substitutos viáveis das energias não-renováveis. Os biocombustíveis devido 

às semelhanças com os combustíveis convencionais, apresentam-se como potenciais candidatos 

para a substituição do diesel derivado do petróleo por fontes renováveis. 

Os biocombustíveis designados de primeira geração foram produzidos a partir de produtos 

agrícolas, contudo a concorrência com a industria alimentar aliada à necessidade de terra arável 

e água potável instituíram fortes barreiras aos seu sucesso.  

A segunda geração de biocombustíveis usou como matéria-prima resíduos agrícolas 

nomeadamente culturas lignocelulosicas em vez dos produtos alimentares. No entanto, a 

tecnologia utilizada não se apresentou comercialmente rentável para uma exploração comercial. 

No processo de optimização, quatro tecnologias distintas foram usadas para a produção de 

combustíveis líquidos tendo por base lignoceluloses. O primeiro sistema baseia-se no processo 

de gaseificação para a produção de gás de síntese, seguida por Fischer-Tropsch ou síntese de 

metanol para produzir alcanos ou metanol respectivamente. A segunda tecnologia empregou 

pirólise e liquefacção termoquímica de bio-óleos para produzir alcanos. Estes compostos além 

de apresentarem um preço elevado, a modernização do processo requer altas pressões de Azoto 

(H2). O terceiro método baseou-se na hidrólise da lignocelulose para a produção de monómeros 

de açúcar, os quais foram ainda convertidos em etanol e/ou hidrocarbonetos aromáticos por 

meio de fermentação e/ou desidratação. Porém, o processo de gaseificação necessita de ser 

levada a cabo a uma temperatura de 1000° C, o que representa um elevado gasto energético e 

monetário. O quarto método inclui o hidro-tratamento e desoxigenação de óleos vegetais. Os 

métodos descritos apresentam-se como uma tecnologia complexa e de elevado custo de 

manutenção, sendo fundamental aprofundar os estudos relacionados com as conversões 

térmicas da biomassa para biocombustíveis, bem como a implementação dos métodos descritos 

em larga escala.

Estes factores levaram ao aparecimento da terceira geração de biocombustíveis, produzidos a 

partir de microalgas. Esta fonte, é considerada promissora, visto que detém uma elevada 

produtividade lipídica ao longo de todo o ano, não necessitando de terra arável nem água 

potável e não entrando em competição direta com a indústria alimentar. Contudo a sua 

utilização é condicionada pela falta de tecnologias para aplicação em escala industrial e no 

elevado preço de processamento, sendo a desidratação da biomassa o passo de maior consumo 

energético e o que acarreta os maiores custos de todo o processo. 

Com base nas limitações apresentadas para os biocombustíveis de terceira geração,  este 

trabalho tem como principal objectivo obter a partir de  biomassa de microalgas uma fração 

lipídica, livre tanto de fosfolipídos como de glicolípidos, para posterior produção de biodiesel. 

As fracções obtidas e ricas em fosfolípidos ou glicolípidos serão ainda analisadas pela sua 

possível aplicação na área biomédica ou alimentar sobre um esquema de bio-refinaria. 

Para este trabalho o etanol foi usado para extrair lípidos neutros dos polares da biomassa húmida 

de microalga (70.0% w/w), e com isto, possibilitar o uso exclusivo de lípidos neutros para a 

produção do biodiesel, com vista a aumentar tanto a qualidade como o rendimento do processo. 

Os lípidos polares obtidos são ainda considerados produtos de valor acrescentado, classificados 

como ácidos gordos de cadeia longa poli-insaturados e altamente propensos a instabilidade 

oxidativa. 

Como resultado, os extractos brutos de lípidos foram divididos em três classes,  por 

cromatografia em coluna de sílica-gel em sistema trifásico. Com o uso de clorofórmio, acetona 

e metanol foi possível separar lipídios neutros (NLs), glicolípidos (GLs) e fosfolípidos (PLs) 

para cada tipo de solvente, respectivamente. No entanto estes solventes orgânicos, classificados 

como cancerígenos não podem ser utilizados na industria alimentar. Foi assim, aplicado um 

sistema de fase binária, utilizando hexano e água com o objectivo de obter as três principais 

classes de lípidos. Três fases foram observadas depois da mistura, a fase superior de hexano, a 

fase coloidal e a fase aquosa inferior. A fracção coloidal foi deixada no papel de filtro enquanto 

que a fase correspondente ao hexano e água foi filtrada, recolhida e posteriormente separada 

num funil de separação. Os perfis lipídicos foram analisados por HPLC-ELSD enquanto a 

composição de ácidos gordos foi determinada por cromatográfica gasosa (GC-MS).

A espécie N. oculata apresentou o maior rendimento para o extracto etanólico com 38.2% (w/w, 

peso seco), seguido pela P. tricornutum com 30.3%. A distribuição de lípidos por classe (%w/w, 

lípidos totais) de N. oculata foi de 45.1, 22.1 e 32.8 e para P. tricornutum de 23.2, 49.1 e 27.7 

para lípidos neutros, glicolípidos e fosfolípidos, respectivamente. De modo semelhante, a 

distribuição de lípidos no sistema-Tri em fase líquida foram hexano (27.4%), coloidal (53.4%) 

e água (19.2%) para N. oculata; e 30.6, 55.4, e 14.0% para P. tricornutum. A distribuição da 

classe coloidal em % (w/w, coloidal total) apresentou resultados de N. oculata (NLs = 2.7 

(5.1%), GLs = 12.5 (23.4%), PLs = 38.2 (71.5%); e para P. tricornutum (NLs = 1.6 (3%), GLs 

= 15.9 (28.7%), PLs = 37.9 (68.3%). Por HPLC-ELSD foram confirmadas as diferentes classes 

de lípidos e a separação dos NLs tanto de GLs como de PLs. 

Triacilglicerol (TAG), diacilglicerol (DAG), monoacilglicerol (MAG), GLs e PLs foram 

detectados nos extractos brutos de microalgas e separados em 40 minutos, por um sistema 

quaternário de hexano, acetato de etilo, água e isopropanol. O elemento considerado menos 

polar, TAG, foi aluído primeiro, seguido de DAG, FA e MAG, GLs e PLs. TAG apresentou-se 

como o lípido dominante tanto no extracto em bruto como na fracção de NLs. 

A composição de ácidos gordos para as duas fases (hexano e coloidais) mostrou que os lípidos 

neutros apresentam-se como adequados para a produção de biodiesel, com mais de 85.0% de 

ácidos gordos saturados e monoinsaturados que são menos propensos a instabilidade oxidativa.  

Os glicolípidos podem ser convertidos para biossurfactantes enquanto que fosfolípidos podem 

ser processados para lipossomas como sistema de entrega de drogas ou alimentos em 

aquacultura. A fracção coloidal enriquecida em ácido eicosapentaenóico (EPA) pode ser 

optimizada e usada no tratamento da aterosclerose, cancro, e doenças neuro-degenerativas.

1. INTRODUCTION 

1.1. General Background  

Fossil fuels  are the world’s primary energy consumption in the transportation sector (Houghton 

et al., 2001), which are finite and, at current usage rates, are expected to  be depleted in this 

century, and thus not renewable in the short period (Akansu, Dulger, Kahraman, &amp;amp; Veziro?lu, 

2004). They are the largest contributor for greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs);and in 2006 were 

associated  with the emissions of 29 Giga tonnes of CO2 (Raupach et al., 2007). It is estimated 

that natural processes remove only about 12 Giga tonnes, therefore, compatible mitigation 

strategies are required to neutralise the excess CO2 (Raupach, et al., 2007). The 1997 Kyoto 

Protocol called for a 5.2% reduction in GHGs emissions worldwide (Houghton, et al., 2001).  

Besides, the persistent hike in global prices of crude oil affects trade balance of oil importing 

countries (Bol, Bhattacharya, &amp;amp; Mishra, 2004). Subsequently, government regulations and full 

or partial tax exemption were established to promote the utilization of alternative fuels to fossil 

fuels (Ralf Gubler, 2007). In this regard, the EU has set a target that 10% of the total 

transportation fuels will be of biofuels by 2020 (Pacini, Silveira, &amp;amp; Da Silva Filho, 2013). 

Prediction shows coal, gas and oil will be the main used energy sources until 2050; but the 

energy derived from biomass and other renewables  are expected to increase dramatically 

(Fig.1.1) (Shell, 2008).

Therefore, the aforementioned issues were considered to be the important trigger for many 

initiatives to search for  alternative sources of energy (Azam, Waris, &amp;amp; Nahar, 2005). Amongst 

these renewable energy sources, biofuels for instance biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane, 

biohydrogen and biobutanol received attention of which, biodiesel is a potential candidate for 

a petro-diesel substitute. Biodiesel, is a mixture of fatty acid alkyl (methyl, ethyl, or propyl) 

esters, which are mainly generated from vegetable oil  or animal fat. Its production increased at 

a faster rate across the world, at an average rate of 32% per year, between 2000 and 2005 (R 

Gubler, 2006). Due to the similarities of physico-chemical properties with petroleum-based 

diesel, biodiesel can be used in conventional diesel engines without significant modifications 

(Venendaal, Jørgensen, &amp;amp; Foster, 1997). However, biodiesel is claimed to be instable towards 

oxidation and has high viscosity. But, these properties depend on feedstock types and biomass 

to biofuel conversion procedures.  

Energy density, weight, and storage size are important characteristics for transportation fuels 

(US DOE,2007; US EIA,2013). For example, hydrogen presents the highest specific energy 

(Fig.1.2). However, vehicles must carry their fuel supply so, to determine which fuel is best 

for motor vehicles, energy density of the fuel is important.  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fig. 1.2. Energy density of various transportation fuels (US DOE,2007; US EIA,2013) 

Hydrogen, because it is so light, requires 15.9 times the container volume to provide the same 

energy as diesel (US DOE,2007; US EIA,2013). Hence, its energy density is so small that using 

hydrogen as transportation fuel for heavy-duty trucks is expensive and impractical. Biodiesel 

and diesel are similar with respect to energy density (US DOE,2007; US EIA,2013).

In general, biofuels have the following socio-economic and environmental advantages over 

fossil fuels: 

? In most case they are carbon-neutral (Daroch, Geng, &amp;amp; Wang, 2013).  

? Biofuel industry creates huge jobs. For example, if oil industry creates jobs for one 

person, coal creates 4 and ethanol creates 152 (De Castro, 2007).  

? Emissions from biofuels are less toxic (Daroch, et al., 2013).  

? Biofuel improves trade balance. In Brazil, for instance, the replacement of gasoline by 

bio-ethanol saved US$ 1.8 billion/year (Dufey, Vermeulen, &amp;amp; Vorley, 2007). 

? It is also renewable (vegetable oils, animal fats and waste cooking oils, etc.) (Agarwal 

&amp;amp; Das, 2001; Kalligeros et al., 2003).  

Hence, consideration of these advantages leads to evolution of biofuel generations from 

different renewable resources like vegetable-based oils, sugar cane, corn, lignocellulosic and 

microalgal biomass (Fig.1.3).

 Sources of Feedstocks 

First Generation 

The first generation biofuels mainly biodiesel have been mainly generated from food and oil 

crops .But, competition with food and fibre production for arable land, fresh water and fertiliser 

requirement are barriers to their success (Group &amp;amp; Management, 2009; Koh &amp;amp; Wilcove, 2008). 

 

 



  

4 
 

Second Generation 

The  second generation biofuels are from lignocelluloses to produce particularly alkanes, 

gasoline and diesel fuels from the whole plant matter like agricultural residues rather than food 

crops (Koh &amp;amp; Wilcove, 2008; Moore, 2008). However, technology for conversion has not 

reached the scale required for commercial exploitation (Koh &amp;amp; Wilcove, 2008).  

Third Generation 

Third generation biofuels are produced from microalgal biomass. Algae are primitive organism 

lacking roots, stems and leaves, but have chlorophyll ‘a’ as their primary photosynthetic 

pigment (Nisbett, Peng, Choi, &amp;amp; Norenzayan, 2001). Prokaryotic cells (cyanobacteria) lack 

membrane-bound organelles (plastids, mitochondria, nuclei, Golgi bodies, and flagella) and are 

more akin to bacteria than algae. Eukaryotic cells, which comprise of many different types of 

common algae, do have these organelles that control the functions of the cell, allowing it to 

survive and reproduce. The most important classes of Eukaryotes are: green algae 

(Chlorophyta), red algae (Rhodophyta) and diatoms (Bacillariophyta) (Khan, Hussain, Prasad, 

&amp;amp; Banerjee, 2009).  

Algae can grow autotrophic- or heterotrophically; the former require only inorganic compounds 

such as CO2, salts and a light energy source for growth, while the latter require an external 

source of organic compounds, as well as nutrients, as an energy source. Some photosynthetic 

algae are mixotrophic, i.e. they have the ability to both perform photosynthesis and acquire 

exogenous organic nutrients (Brennan &amp;amp; Owende, 2010). For autotrophic processes, 

photosynthesis is a key component, whereby microalgae convert solar radiation and CO2 

absorbed by chloroplasts into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) the usable energy currency at 

cellular level, which is used in respiration to produce energy to support growth (Zilinskas &amp;amp; 

Zilinskas, 1974). 

Microalgae Biomass Production 

To optimize microalgal biomass production raceways open ponds and closed photobioreactor 

have been developed (Fig.1.4). Raceways and open ponds are usually built in concrete, but 

compacted earth lined ponds with white plastic have also been used. Closed photobioreactor 

systems include the tubular, flat panel, and column (Brennan &amp;amp; Owende, 2010).  



  

5 
 

Open systems are relatively cheaper but have poor biomass productivity. Closed systems yield 

high biomass but are expensive. These area needs further work to search for an ideal method of 

biomass production for industrial scale application. 

           

          Fig.1.4. Photo of open system - raceway (left) and closed system-tubular       

photobioreactor (right) 

Biomass Harvesting 

The harvesting of microalgal biomass which generally requires one or more solid–liquid 

separation steps is a challenging phase of the algal biomass production process, and usually 

accounts for 20–30% of the total costs of production (Brennan &amp;amp; Owende, 2010). Filtration, 

flocculation (Fig.1.5) and centrifugations are the most commonly used harvesting technologies. 

    

Fig. 1.5. Harvesting of microalgae biomass by flocculation 

Lipid Content 

While many microalgae strain naturally have high lipid content (ca. 20–50% dry weight), it is 

possible to increase the concentration and modulate the lipid profile by optimising the growth 

determining factors.  



  

6 
 

For instance, Nannochloropsis strain was shown to have 68.5% lipid content after nitrogen 

deprivation (Bondioli et al., 2012). Lipid content of N. oculata increased from 30.8% to 50.4% 

upon  2% CO2 aeration (Chiu et al., 2009).  

Lipid production increased by 14.9% with increasing temperature from 20°C to 25°C (Converti, 

Casazza, Ortiz, Perego, &amp;amp; Del Borghi, 2009). UV-A application increases saturated FAs to 

PUFAs ratio (Forján et al., 2011). Similarly, P. tricornutum TAG levels increased from 69 to 

75% in nitrogen limitation (Hu et al., 2008). The decrease from 25°C to 10°C for 12h leads to 

highest yields of PUFAs and EPA in  P. tricornutum (Jiang &amp;amp; Gao, 2004). 

Advantages of using Microalgae 

Microalgae biomass is considered a better feedstock for biofuel and/or other value added 

products because microalgae 

? Oil productivity exceeds the yield of the best oilseed crops. For instance, biodiesel yield 

is of 12,000 Lha-1 for microalgae compared with 1190 Lha-1 for rapeseed (Schenk et 

al., 2008);  

? Needs less water than terrestrial crops (Dismukes, Carrieri, Bennette, Ananyev, &amp;amp; 

Posewitz, 2008);  

? Can be cultivated in brackish water or sea water  and  on non-arable land (Searchinger 

et al., 2008); 

? Have a rapid growth potential , the exponential growth rates can double their biomass 

in periods as short as 3.5 h  (Metting Jr, 1996);  

? Biomass production can fixate high amount of CO2 (1 kg of dry algal biomass /1.83 kg 

of CO2) (Chisti, 2007); 

? Nutrients for cultivation(especially nitrogen  and phosphorous) can be obtained from 

wastewater, therefore, apart from providing growth medium, there is a dual potential 

for treatment of wastewaters  (Cantrell, Ducey, Ro, &amp;amp; Hunt, 2008);  

? Cultivation does not require herbicides or pesticides (Rodolfi et al., 2009);  

? Produce valuable co-products such as proteins , ?-carotene, and residual biomass after 

oil extraction (Brennan &amp;amp; Owende, 2010; Spolaore, Joannis-Cassan, Duran, &amp;amp; 

Isambert, 2006);  

? Oil yield may be enhanced under nitrogen deficiency or high light intensity (Qin, 2005).

Bio-refinery 

Among the factors that affect the cost of biofuels from microalgae is biomass to biofuel 

conversion technologies (Brennan &amp;amp; Owende, 2010).One approach to make it an economically 

competitive feedstock is to apply the bio-refinery concept (Fig.1.6).  

The bio-refinery concept embraces a whole crop approach of biomass conversion pathways 

leading to a whole portfolio of valuable products, drawing direct similarities to today’s 

petroleum refineries, in which multiple fuels, basic chemicals, intermediate products and 

sophisticated products are produced from petroleum (Cherubini, 2010; Morais &amp;amp; Bogel-

Lukasik, 2013). 

The most important energy products that can be produced in biorefineries are:  

? Gaseous biofuels (biogas, syngas hydrogen,and biomethane)  

? Solid biofuels (biochar)  

? Liquid biofuels (bioethanol, biodiesel, Fischer-Tropsch fuels, and bio-oil) 

Some of material products are 

? Biochemicals (fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals, building blocks, and bulk chemicals) 

? Organic acids (succinic, lactic, itaconic, fumaric and other sugar derivatives)

Microalgal Global Companies  

The world has been confronted with a food and energy crisis due to accelerated global 

population growth and the depletion of finite fossil fuel resources (Jacob-Lopes, Queiroz, 

Ramírez-Mérida, &amp;amp; Zepka, 2015). The increase in nutritional problems along with rising fuel 

demands and environmental problems have increased the search for nutritional supplements 

and sustainable sources of energy.  

Microalgae have great potential in generating energy from biotechnological processes using 

renewable sources and do not compromise food production. Microalgae have been of major 

interest in biofuel production as well as in the feed, chemical and pharmaceutical sectors (Jacob-

Lopes, et al., 2015). Depending on the species and growth conditions, microalgae can be 

selected to produce a wide variety and abundance of lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and 

feedstocks important for biofuel and production of nutraceuticals (Jacob-Lopes, et al., 2015). 

For instance, Table 1.1 below shows different global companies engaged in algae with CO2 

sequestering technology.

1.2. Liquid Fuels from Biomass 

The following are common types of processes for the production of liquid fuels from 

lignocelluloses or other biomasses (Fig.1.7) (Huber &amp;amp; Dumesic, 2006). The first process 

involves gasification to produce syngas, followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to produce 

alkanes. The second employs pyrolysis and thermochemical liquefaction for bio-oils 

production, which are further refined to produce alkanes. The third relies on hydrolysis of 

lignocellulose for sugar monomer production, and is further converted into ethanol and/or 

aromatic hydrocarbons through fermentation and/or dehydration. However, gasification was 

carried out at 1000oC which is energy intensive. Pyrolysis and liquefaction are expensive as 

refining or upgrading of  biooil requires high H2 pressure (Brennan &amp;amp; Owende, 2010). Further 

study is required to achieve a better understanding of the economics of biomass thermal 

conversions for bio-fuel production, as well as resolving issues related to the capabilities of 

these technologies in industrial application. 

 

    Fig. 1.7. Processes for production of liquid fuels from biomass (Huber &amp;amp; Dumesic, 2006) 

1.3. Vegetable Oils to Green Diesel 

Despite the fact that most of the current biofuels are produced through a transesterification 

process, these fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) have high oxygen content, poor flow property 

at low temperatures and poor oxidative stability (Ma &amp;amp; Hanna, 1999). To solve such problems, 

catalytic cracking (Corma, Huber, Sauvanaud, &amp;amp; O'connor, 2007), hydrotreating (Huber, 

O’Connor, &amp;amp; Corma, 2007),and deoxygenation (Snåre, Kubickova, Mäki-Arvela, Eränen, &amp;amp; 

Murzin, 2006) have been attempted to produce green diesel. The claims of green diesel over 

biodiesel are the following (Zhao, Brück, &amp;amp; Lercher, 2013):

1) Green diesel is sulphur free; 2) Its cetane number and calorific values are higher than 

biodiesel and even petro-diesel; and 3) Improved cold filter plug point  

However, the utilization of cracking method has several drawbacks. It contains large amount 

of oxygenated and aromatic compounds, whose use is strictly regulated in Europe. Most 

importantly, zeolite cracking is a non-selective process that produces a wide range of 

compounds and undesired coke formation (Corma, et al., 2007). The hydrotreating process is 

much more selective than cracking in producing diesel range hydrocarbons. However, sulfide 

catalysts contaminate products via sulfur leaching and  lead also to catalyst deactivation (Huber, 

et al., 2007). Compared with the hydrotreating process, catalytic deoxygenation possesses 

several advantages, including higher selectivity to the target linear hydrocarbons and less 

additional hydrogen cost because of few hydrogen requirements. Decarboxylation, 

decarbonylation and hydrodeoxygenation are the main reaction routes. Noble metal supported 

catalysts (e.g., commercial Pd/C and Pt/C) are usually employed. However, the high price of 

noble metal also limits the application in large-scale industrial production (Snåre, et al., 2006).  

Therefore, until green diesel gets solution to its drawbacks, no doubt that biodiesel will be 

competitive alternative to petro-diesel. Hence, biodiesel produced from transesterification of 

vegetable oils is around 80% of the current biofuel market in Europe (Bendz, 2005) and 

production is increasing exponentially reaching 9,500,000 tons in 2010 (Knothe, 2010). 

1.4. Microalgae Biochemistry and Biotechnology  

1.4.1. Lipid Classes 

Microalgae crude lipids contain two fundamental categories of lipids: neutral lipids (NLs) and 

polar lipids. The polar lipids comprise mainly phospholipids (PLs) and glycolipids (GLs) 

(Mayzaud, Boutoute, Perissinotto, &amp;amp; Nichols, 2007; Ryckebosch, Muylaert, &amp;amp; Foubert, 2012; 

Fangfang Yang et al., 2014). For instance, hydrocarbons (HC), cholesterol, sterols, pigments ( 

i.e., ?-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and astaxanthin etc.), tri, di and mono acyl glycerols (TAG, 

DAG, and MAG), fatty acids (FAs) , GLs and PLs were reported in  crude extracts of microalga 

(Brennan &amp;amp; Owende, 2010; Jones, Manning, Montoya, Keller, &amp;amp; Poenie, 2012). 

 

 



  

12 
 

 Neutral Lipids  

NLs usually comprise up to 50% microalgae lipid content (Fangfang Yang, et al., 2014). They 

are water-insoluble, whereas polar lipids have one or more water-soluble functional groups 

(Mayzaud, et al., 2007; Ryckebosch, et al., 2012; Fangfang Yang, et al., 2014). TAG, DAG, 

MAG and FA are the main NLs fractions reported of which TAG is dominant in microalgae.  

TAG, stored in adipose tissue, is a major form of energy storage in animals and plants 

(Brasaemle, 2007). NLs can be converted into a biodiesel via transesterification (Bendz, 2005) 

(Fig.1.8). Transesterification consists of three consecutive reversible reactions of TAG to DAG, 

followed by DAG to monoacylglycerol, and finally to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and 

glycerol (Fig.1.8). 

 

 Fig. 1.8. Biodiesel production through transesterification of TAG 

 

The transesterification reaction can be catalysed by alkaline catalysts such as sodium or 

potassium hydroxide (Knothe, 2005b). Such catalysts lead to complete conversion with 98% 

ester yields. However, their efficiency decreases when  free fatty acids (FFAs) content is higher 

than 0.5% (w/w%,  oil) due to saponification (Lotero et al., 2006; Lotero et al., 2005). On the 

contrary, acid catalysts offer the advantage that they can catalyse the transesterification of 

acylglycerols and esterification of FFAs simultaneously.  

Glycerol is a by-product of biodiesel, which is a very attractive raw material for fine chemicals 

due to its relatively low cost and wide availability (Werpy et al., 2004). 26% of glycerol 

consumption was associated with pharmaceutical, cosmetic and soap industries- wider  

applications were reviewed and reported at (Fangxia Yang, Hanna, &amp;amp; Sun, 2012).

Phospholipids 

PLs are a class of lipids that are a major component of all cell membranes. They can form lipid 

bilayers because of their amphiphilic nature. The structure of the PLs molecule generally 

consists of two hydrophobic FA “tails” and a hydrophilic phosphate “head”, joined together by 

a glycerol molecule (Fig 1.9). They are widely distributed in animals and plants, and the main 

sources include vegetable oils (e.g. soybean) and animal tissues (e.g. egg yolk) (Wendel, 1995). 

However, soybean and egg yolk have differences in the contents and types of PLs. 

For example: 1) egg yolk lecithin contains high amounts of PC; 2) PLs in egg yolk have long 

chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) of n-6 and n-3 series, primarily arachidonic acid 

(AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are absent from soybean lecithins; and 3) the 

saturation level of egg yolk lecithins is higher than that of soybean lecithins (Hager, De Paoli, 

Ihlo, Farach, &amp;amp; Poole, 1993), so their oxidative stability is better than that of soybean lecithins.  

Each individual PLs fraction provides the following functions (Fig 1.9): 

? Phosphatidylcholine (PC) has function of nourishing the brain and improving 

intelligence (Little, Levy, Chuaqui-Kidd, &amp;amp; Hand, 1985);  

? Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) has  important role in membrane fusion (Dowhan, 

Bogdanov, &amp;amp; Mileykovskaya, 2002);  

? Phosphatidylserine (PS) improves function of nerve cells and enhancing the memory of 

brain (Pepeu, Pepeu, &amp;amp; Amaducci, 1996);  

? Phosphatidylinositol (PI) plays a very important role in the process of transmission of 

messages in neural system (Bansal &amp;amp; Majerus, 1990);  

? Phosphatidyic acid (PA) is a precursor for the biosynthesis of many other lipids (Delon 

et al., 2004);  

? Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) is a glycerophospholipid found in pulmonary surfactant 

(King &amp;amp; MacBeth, 1981).

PLs can also be used as drug delivery system as liposome. Therapeutic agents such as 

proteins/peptides, nucleic acids, anticarcinogens, and other drugs have the drawbacks of low 

bioavailability, rapid clearance, and high toxicity. Liposomes have many advantages being able 

to deliver hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs, targeting, and tissue compatibility, reducing drug 

toxicity and improving its stability (Fig 1.10). Liposomes can serve as the carriers of antitumor, 

antifungal, analgesic, in gene therapeutics and vaccines (Delalat et al., 2015; J. Li et al., 2015).

Glycolipids 

Glycolipids (GLs) are lipids with a carbohydrate attached by a glycosidic bond (Fig 

1.11) .Their role is to serve as markers for cellular recognition and also to provide energy. GLs 

can be converted to biosurfactants (Abdel-Mawgoud, Hausmann, Lépine, Müller, &amp;amp; Déziel, 

2011; Kitamoto, Isoda, &amp;amp; Nakahara, 2002). Biosurfactants show unique properties (e.g., mild 

production conditions, lower toxicity, higher biodegradability and environmental compatibility 

compared to their chemical counterparts (Kitamoto, et al., 2002). The numerous advantages of 

biosurfactants have applications not only in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries 

but in environmental protection (soil washing, oil spills cleaning). GLs biosurfactants are the 

most promising due to high productivity from renewable resources (Kitamoto, et al., 2002).

if ‘Y’ is glycerol, it is called glycerol glycolipid.  

Polar lipids particularly PLs and GLs provide wider applications not only in lipid form but also 

the fatty acids especially long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. For instance, Foley et al. (2011) 

states highly unsaturated lipids occur more frequently in polar lipid fractions. Eicosapentaenoic 

acid (EPA, C20:5n-3) and DHA (C22:6n-3) are important n-3-PUFA, while AA (C20:4 n-6) is

a vital n-6-PUFA and are mainly associated with PLs class of microalgae. EPA and DHA are 

important in the treatment of atherosclerosis, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases such as 

Alzheimer’s. AA and DHA are of special importance in the brain and blood vessels and are 

considered to be essential for pre and post-natal brain and retina development (Crawford, 2000). 

The eicosanoids, such as prostaglandin, prostacyclin and leukotriene, derived from n-3-PUFAs 

are important for infant development, modulatory vascular resistance and wound healing 

(Sijtsma &amp;amp; De Swaaf, 2004; Simopoulos, 1999). Modern nutritional theory is focusing on the 

numerous health benefits of maintaining sufficient levels of n-3-PUFAs (V. Patil &amp;amp; Gislerod, 

2006). 

The principal dietary source of DHA and EPA is marine fish. Fish is a declining resource, and 

there are serious environmental consequences related to the continued exploitation of fish 

stocks in order to meet the demands of an expanding market.  

Moreover, fish accumulate pollutants. Also, the extracted oil often has an unpleasant odour, 

and the proportion of specific FAs in its TAG is difficult to control. The global aquaculture 

production was 547 million tonnes in 2003 (V. Patil, Källqvist, Olsen, Vogt, &amp;amp; Gislerød, 2007) 

and it has been growing by roughly 9% annually (Naylor &amp;amp; Burke, 2005). Feed is the largest 

production cost for commercial aquaculture plants, so improving feed efficiency in industrial 

systems has high priority. Considerable evidence has indicated that n-3-PUFAs in fish oils are 

actually derived via the marine food chain from zooplankton consuming n-3-PUFAs -

synthesising microalgae (Yongmanitchai &amp;amp; Ward, 1989). 

Therefore, marine microalgae are some of the most important feed sources in aquaculture (live 

feed for larvae of bivalves, and marine fish; food for rotifers and shrimps), due to their 

nutritional value and their ability to synthesise and accumulate great amounts of n-3-PUFA. 

Specific algal species are suitable for preparation of animal feed supplements. Algae species 

such as Chlorella, Scenedesmus, and Haematococcus have beneficial aspects including 

improved immune response and fertility, and better weight control (Brennan &amp;amp; Owende, 2010).

1.4.2. Fatty Acid Composition 

Higher plants oil has suitable FAs for biodiesel production (Table 1.2). The major FAs are 

palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1) and linoleic acid (C18:2). 

However, these oil bearing plants compete with food supply.

aThe nomenclature shows the number of carbon atoms and the number of C=C double 

bonds: for example, the present sample contained 14 C atoms and no double bonds. Adapted from Peng (2012). 

In algae, the most commonly synthesized FAs have chain lengths that range from C16 to C18, 

similar to those of higher plants (Hu et al., 2008; Ohlrogge &amp;amp; Browse, 1995). In general, 

saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are predominant in 

most algae (Alonso, Grima, Pérez, Sánchez, &amp;amp; Camacho, 1992). Specifically, the major FAs 

are C16:0 and C16:1 in the Bacillariophyceae, C16:0 and C18:1 in the Chlorophyceae and 

Prasinophyceae, C16:0, C16:1 and C18:1 in the Chrysophyceae and Prymnesiophyceae, C16:0 

and C20:1 in the Cryptophyceae, C14:0,  C16:0, C16:1 and C18:1 in Cyanobacteriaa (Cobelas 

&amp;amp; Lechado, 1989). 

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) contain two or more double bonds. Based on the number 

of double bonds, individual FAs are named dienoic, trienoic, tetraenoic, pentaenoic and 

hexaenoic FAs. Also, depending on the position of the first double bond from the terminal 

methyl end (n) of the carbon chain, a FA may be either an n-3-PUFAs (i.e., the third carbon 

from the end of the FA) or an n-6-PUFAs (i.e., the sixth carbon from the end of the fatty acid). 

The major PUFAs are C20:5 (n-3) and C22:6 (n-6) in Bacillarilophyceae, C18:2 and C18:3 (n-

3)  in Euglenophyceae,C20:3 and C20:4 (n-3)  in Eustigmatophyceae, C18:5 (n-3)  and C22:6 

(n-3)  in Dinophyceae, C18:2, C18:3 (n-3)  and C22:6 (n-3)  in Prymnesiophyceae,C18:2 and 

C20:5 in Rhodophyceae and C16:0, C18:2 and C18:3 (n-3)  in cyanobacteria (Basova, 2005).  

Table 1.3 shows the FAs composition of different microalgae strains. The major FAs are C20:5, 

palmitoleic acid (C16:1), C16:0, C14:0, and arachidonic acid (C20:4) with lesser amounts of 



  

18 
 

C18:1 and C18:2. The sum of SFAs and MUFAs ranges from 52-67% and PUFAs from 33-

48% in all strains presented.

Table 1.4 shows the FAs profiles of the same strains but not identical results. For instance, the 

sum of PUFAs for P. tricornutum ranges from 14 to 48%. FAs profiles of lipid fractions were 

also reported with widespread results. It is very likely that a different method of oil extraction, 

lipid sources, strain types, biomass production methods affect FAs distributions depending on 

the relative proportion of polar and NLs (Ryckebosch, et al., 2012; Wang &amp;amp; Wang, 2012). 

FAs profiles of individual lipid classes from ethanolic extracts of Nannochloropsis was reported 

at (Wang &amp;amp; Wang, 2012). The total SFAs in TAG tended to be lower than that in polar lipids, 

and the TAG total MUFAs tended to be higher than that in polar lipids.  

The sum of SFAs and MUFAs are greater than sum of PUFAs in polar lipids. Following the 

same protocol, the reverse results were reported for Schizochytrium. This shows strain types 

can affect the FAs distribution. 



  

20 
 

Ryckebosch et al .(2012) also detailed FAs composition (%TFA, w/w) of lipid class of P. 

tricornutum (Table 1.5). The dominant FAs in NLs were C16:0 and C16:1; in PLs were C16:0, 

C16:1 and C20:5; in GLs were C16:0, C16:1, C16:3 and C20:5. This finding implies that 

PUFAs especially EPA are associated with polar lipids and SFAs and MUFAs with NLs. 

However, the cells were grown in batch culture and continuously illuminated with two 

fluorescent lamps. This results may not be similar with biomass produced under normal growth 

conditions. In general, growth conditions can affect FAs distribution in both total lipids and 

lipid fractions. These details were disclosed for both N.oculata and P. tricornutum at (Shen et 

al., 2016) grown under nitrogen repletion  (N+) and depletion (N-).

1.5. Problem Statement and Rationale  

We are in the century of uncertainty regarding petro-diesel supply as predictions show that they 

are about to be depleted (Azam, et al., 2005). More than affordability, availability seems pivotal. 

Consequently, it is time to work on how to reduce the cost of biodiesel production as it appears 

particularly advantageous for the transportation sector. However, among the factors that affect 

the cost of biofuels, biomass production seems a challenging venture than other factors and 

boosted responsibility on professionals specialized in the area (Brennan &amp;amp; Owende, 2010).  

Biomass Dewatering and the Way Forward to Reduce the Cost 

Energy consumption of drying microalgae biomass accounted for the majority of the total 

processing energy (Lardon, Helias, Sialve, Steyer, &amp;amp; Bernard, 2009; P. D. Patil, Reddy, et al., 

2012).Various researchers have investigated wet lipid extraction methods, including 

ultrasound-assisted extraction (Adam, Abert-Vian, Peltier, &amp;amp; Chemat, 2012), simultaneous 

distillation and extraction process (Tanzi, Vian, &amp;amp; Chemat, 2013), microwave-assisted 

extraction (Cheng, Yu, Li, Zhou, &amp;amp; Cen, 2013), and supercritical fluid extraction (Halim, 

Gladman, Danquah, &amp;amp; Webley, 2011). Unfortunately, these require high temperature and long 

times; so they are not ideal for industrial-scale production. 

Standard methods for lipid extraction employ chloroform and methanol that are carcinogenic 

(Bligh &amp;amp; Dyer, 1959; Folch, Lees, &amp;amp; Sloane-Stanley, 1957). 

Some alcohols have the potential to extract lipids from microalgae (M. Chen et al., 2012; 

Fajardo et al., 2007; Fangfang Yang, et al., 2014). FA composition of ethanolic extract was 

higher when compared to some solvents (Fig.1.12) (Petrick et al., 2013). FAs recovery by 

ethanol is better than chloroform, propanol, methanol or hexane (Fig.1.12). Ethanol 

successfully extracts as much as the standard methods for lipid extraction as shown in (Fig.1.12) 

(Fangfang Yang, et al., 2014). Any physical pre-treatments to induce cell lysis (e.g., sonication 

or microwaves), which if applied incur additional costs, are not essential and instead extraction 

twice is sufficient. Extraction can be carried out at reflux or room temperature and is not energy 

consuming (Fangfang Yang, et al., 2014). Ethanol is a food grade solvent when compared with 

chloroform and methanol. Unlike higher plants lipids, microalgal lipids are complex for they 

comprise almost equal proportion of both neutral and polar lipids. Hence, a solvent that has 

both polar and non-polar nature is more effective at extracting total lipids from wet microalgae 

biomass than a purely non-polar.  



  

22 
 

For instance, hexane is not effective at extracting total lipids from wet microalgae biomass but 

effective at extracting from higher plants. It seems hexane or non-polar may extract mainly the 

NLs from microalga and the polar are left in spent biomass as waste. 

There are some reports where extraction by alcohols from wet biomass containing water is  

easier than from dried biomass. For example, 2-ethoxyethanol is claimed to be more effective 

at extracting lipids from wet microalgal biomass than dried  as compared to chloroform: 

methanol or hexane (Jones, et al., 2012).  

 

Fig. 1.12. Comparison of lipid extraction using different solvents (Petrick, et al., 2013) 

The Merits of Microalgae Lipid Separation 

Plant oils, such as palm, rape, sunflower, etc., are TAG containing about 90% FAs (Petkov, 

Ivanova, Iliev, &amp;amp; Vaseva, 2012). They are relatively easy to be extracted from seeds. Unlike 

the seeds of many higher plants, microalgal lipids are not only TAG. For example, TAG of the 

highly oleaginous alga Parietochloris incisa represent 42.9% of total lipids, and TAG of 

Pavlova lutheri are 40.3% (Petkov, et al., 2012). The percentages of TAG are lower in the dried 

lipid extract where chlorophyll, carotenoids, sterols are concentrated, too.

For instance, after hydrolysis of 1 kg microalgal lipids, the usual products are 0.3–0.5 kg FAs, 

0.2–0.4 kg unsaponifiable substances (e.g., hydrocarbons, carotenoids, and sterols etc.,), and 

0.2–0.3 kg water soluble substances (i.e., glycerol, and phosphoric acid) (Petkov et al., 2012). 

Algal lipids are predominantly mono- and digalactosyl diacylglycerols, PLs and unsaponifiable 

substances, and subsequently the FAs content reaches up to 31–32% as a mean value.  

Galactose, glycerol, and phosphoric acid, which are esterified in lipid molecules during this 

treatment, will lose their quality as nutrient components, or will be completely wasted. As a 

result, microalgal lipids have two to three times lower content of FAs compared to plant oils. It 

was reported that 15 kg biomass of Chlorella and Scenedesmus can render 1 kg biodiesel. This 

shows except 31–32% of FAs, the remaining is waste. Waste has environmental and socio-

economic impacts and necessitates the way forward to reduce the impacts. 

One approach can be via applying the bio-refinery concept (Cherubini, 2010; Morais &amp;amp; Bogel-

Lukasik, 2013).Ethanol or other solvents extract total lipids which contain both neutral and 

polar lipids (i.e., GLs and PLs). But, separating polar lipids from NLs of microalgae for 

preparing biodiesel are important for several merits (Iyer, 2016). For example, unsaturated 

lipids occur more frequently in polar lipid fractions specifically PLs (Foley, Beach, &amp;amp; 

Zimmerman, 2011). The PUFAs are highly prone to  spontaneous oxidation as they contain 

multiple double bonds (Ostrea, Cepeda, Fleury, &amp;amp; Balun, 1985).  

Furthermore, the phosphate moiety in PLs complicates transesterification (Iyer, 2016; Van 

Gerpen, 2005). Yield of FAMEs was reduced when soybean oil with significant amount of PLs 

was transesterified with C. antarctica lipase (Watanabe, Shimada, Sugihara, &amp;amp; Tominaga, 

2002). The presence of 5 and 10% (w/w, DW) PLs in soybean oil decreases the yield of FAMEs 

by 6.8 and 9.7% (w/w, DW) (Y. Li, Du, &amp;amp; Liu, 2014). The separation of PLs from NLs 

increased the yield of FAMEs (Freedman, Pryde, &amp;amp; Mounts, 1984). Therefore, separation of 

the neutral from the polar has dual advantages: it improves biodiesel quality and yield; and 

polar lipids can be used as value added products. The polar lipids comprise around 50% of the 

total lipids (Fangfang Yang, et al., 2014).  

 

 

 



  

24 
 

Although these Omega-3-FAs are obtained from fish oil, they are claimed to be derived from 

microalgae via food chain (Yongmanitchai &amp;amp; Ward, 1989). EPA and DHA have the potential to 

change the fluidity and permeability of the membrane (Burri, Hoem, Banni, &amp;amp; Berge, 2012). 

Liposome from PLs enriched in these FAs are targeting and can deliver both hydrophilic and 

hydrophobic drugs. Hence, chromatographic separation of these lipids are essential. 

Besides, PLs separation from NLs is good to comply with regulations and for the safety of the 

engine. For instance, ASTM D6751 standards state that phosphorus content should be below 

10 ppm. A higher phosphorus content (&gt;10 ppm) in biodiesel would result in phosphorus 

remaining in exhaust emissions during combustion of FAMEs (biodiesel) poisoning the catalyst 

in the converter, resulting in serious damage to the catalytic converter (Kaleli, 2001; Tyson &amp;amp; 

McCormick, 2006).  

The presence of polar lipids necessitates using more methanol as they contain acyl groups 

involving in transesterification. The excess moles of methanol will get solubilized in micelles 

leading to localized concentration of methanol around the catalyst, resulting in lowering the 

activity of the catalyst and subsequently reducing the yield of FAMEs (Kaleli, 2001; Tyson &amp;amp; 

McCormick, 2006).  

However, finding industrially feasible lipid separation or oil degumming (first stage in oil 

refining process) is essential. The most commonly used chemicals (chloroform and methanol) 

for lipid separation are carcinogenic and requires silica column that cannot be beyond lab scale.   

Degumming of crude soybean oil has been carried out by ultrafiltration using polymeric 

membranes (Pagliero, Ochoa, Marchese, &amp;amp; Mattea, 2001 &amp;amp; 2004). However, the instability 

of polymeric membranes in organic solvents has been the barriers to oil degumming/refining. 

Ceramic membrane for oil degumming is energy intensive and so costly (De Souza, Petrus, 

Gonçalves, &amp;amp; Viotto, 2008).  

The drawback of the alkali refining process is the entrainment of significant quantities of neutral 

oil with the soap stock resulting in a loss of yield. Additional costs are incurred by the soap 

stock splitting and effluent treatment. Acid degumming process is usually carried out at elevated 

temperature around 90°C (Mag &amp;amp; Reid, 1980). The organic refining process (Copeland &amp;amp; 

Belcher, 2000) uses a large excess of citric acid.

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260877407005705


  

25 
 

In degumming, enzymes are incapable of catalysing the hydrolysis of non-hydratable 

phosphatides (alkaline earth salts of phosphatidic acid) under industrial conditions (Dijkstra, 

2010). Enzymes are expensive and the amount available for industrial scale is not enough, thus 

its activity can be affected by extreme conditions such as high temperature and organic solvents, 

for example lower alcohol, methanol or ethanol. 

Consequently, in our study we used binary phase system (hexane + water) and separated the 

polar lipids from NLs employing a process known as Liquid Tri-phase System (LTPS). Hexane 

is relatively tolerable solvent and water is safer. Less energy consuming mixing process was 

applied and lipid classes of various FAs and wider applications were separated under the 

biorefinery scheme. To get optimum amount of distinctly separated lipid classes in short span 

of time, centrifugation needs to be applied over mixing. The solvents are recovered and reused. 

In this regard, we hypothesize the cost of biodiesel production can be reduced and our waste 

foot print and economic loss due to the polar lipids use, too. In our view, this is a contribution 

to research gaps and first report of oil degumming that can be feasible industrially.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Experiments were conducted in the laboratory of the Marine Biotechnology group, from the 

Centre of Marine Sciences (CCMAR) at the University of Algarve, Faro, Portugal.  

2.1. Materials  

The microalgal biomass from N. oculata and P. tricornutum was supplied by NECTON S.A., 

Portugal. Both cultures were grown outdoors in flat panel and tubular photobioreactors. 

Biomass harvesting was performed by centrifugation, and the resulting microalga paste was 

frozen at -20°C until use. 

All chemicals used in this experiment were of analytical grade and HPLC grade solvents were 

used only for HPLC-ELSD and GC-MS. 

2.2. Methods 

2.2.1. Moisture Content 

Prior to lipid extraction, 1g of microalgae biomass was incubated in an oven at 60°C for 72 h 

(n=3) in order to determine its moisture content. The percentage moisture in the biomass was 

calculated using (Eq .2.1): 

Moisture content = [(W1- W2)/ (W1-Wp)] *100 % ---------------------------------------- (Eq. 2.1)  

Where, W1 = Original weight of the sample (with plate) before drying 

             W2 = Weight of the sample (with plate) after drying and Wp = Plate weight 

2.2.2. Total Lipid Extraction  

Lipids were extracted according to the protocol described in (Yao, Gerde, &amp;amp; Wang, 2012) with 

a few modifications. Briefly, 10.0 g of microalgae paste containing 70.0% water was dispersed 

in 100 mL of ethanol and stirred at reflux temperature of ethanol (78.5oC) for 90 min (Scheme 

2.1). After refluxing, the mixture was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm and 20oC for 10 min. The 

supernatant (Ethanol (ET)-1) was separated from the pellet by decanting. The insoluble matter 

was further extracted with ethanol under reflux conditions for 30 min (ET-2, 50 mL) and 15 

min (ET-3, 25 mL), followed by centrifugation under the same conditions and filtered through 

Whatman no. 4 filter paper. Ethanol and water were recovered from the mixture using a rotatory 

evaporator under reduced pressure. The lipid content was estimated using (Eq. 2.2). 

 Biomass lipid content = [Wo/Ws] *100 % ------------------------------------------------- (Eq. 2.2)  

Where, Wo = weight of lipid extracted; Ws = weight of sample

2.2.3. Lipid Characterization 

Lipid Profiles 

Lipids were separated into NLs, GLs and PLs using column chromatography applying the 

method described at (Wang &amp;amp; Wang, 2012) with little modification (Scheme 2.2). Briefly, 2.0 

g of lipid, 100 mL of chloroform: methanol (1:1, v/v) and 2.0-5.0 g of silica were mixed in 500 

mL rounded bottom conical flask. Then, the mixture was rotary-evaporated until dryness. Next, 

it was loaded on top of a 1.4 cm I.D. x 18 cm length glass column filled with 30 g silica gel 

(60µm). The NLs were first eluted using 300 mL chloroform, then 300 mL of acetone: methanol 

(9:1, v/v) for GLs; and lastly 300 mL methanol for PLs. The solvents were recovered from each 

lipid classes and the weight of the lipids was measured and calculated (% w/w, total lipids). 



  

29 
 

Microalgae crude extracts and lipid fractions were characterized by HPLC (KNAUER) coupled 

with an Evaporative Light Scattering Detector (ELSD; Agilent Technologies, Varian 380-LC) 

to analyse the major lipid classes. 

Before use, HPLC grade solvents were filtered with (Nylon membrane, 0.45µm, and 47mm) 

and degassed. After optimization of the parameters for the ELSD, evaporator temperature was 

set at 50oC and nebulizer at 45oC. The flow rate of the carrier gas (compressed pure nitrogen) 

was maintained at 1.60 SLM. Gain and smoothing factor was fixed at 2 and 30, respectively.  

Lipid standards and microalgae extracts were resolved using Phenomenex sphereClone column 

(250 mm x 4.6 mm ID, 5µm particle size). Data acquisition was performed using Clarity 

software (3.1.7) (VWR, Darmstadt, Germany).  
 

The separation of lipid fractions was achieved with a gradient programme shown below (Table 

2.1). A combination of four different solvents was used as follows, hexane: ethylacetate:water: 

isopropanol. Briefly, samples were injected at time 0.0 and were eluted with hexane- 

ethylacetate-isopropanol (98:1:1, v/v/v) for 10.0 min at a linear flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. 

Solvents were changed from 98:1:1: to isopropanol (100%) at  flow rate of 0.8mL/min over the 

next  15min. After 25min, the elution solvent was changed to isopropanol : water (75:25; v/v 

using  the same flow rate 0.8mL/min for 5.0 min. In the next 10.0 min, 100.0% isopropanol was 

used to remove the polar contaminants (if any). After 40min the first solvent mixtures were run 

again to equilibrate the  column for 10 to 15min and the next samples were injected.

2.2.4. Fatty Acid Composition 

Lipids (i.e., crude extracts and NLs fractions) were converted into their corresponding FAMEs 

using methanol by an acid catalysed method. The FAMEs profile was then characterized 

employing GC-MS.  

Transesterification was done according to the method reported by Lam &amp;amp; Lee (2013) with little 

modifications. Briefly microalgae lipids were mixed with a solution of methanol and 2% H2SO4 

in a 500 mL rounded bottom flask and stirred at reflux temperature (64–69°C) for 4h. The 

reaction was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using hexane and ethylacetate 

(95:5, v/ v). After reaction completion, solvent was removed up to 1/4 of the volume to reduce 

emulsions and sequentially extracted three times with hexane. Hexane fractions were 

transferred to a separating funnel and washed with distilled water until the acid was neutralized, 

followed by a saturated NaCl solution treatment. It was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, 

and recovered using a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure to obtain FAMEs.  

The FAMEs profile was determined in an Agilent GC-MS (Agilent 6890 Network GC System, 

5973 Inert Mass Selective Detector) equipped with a DB5-MS capillary column (25 m×0.25 

mm internal diameter, 0.25 ?m film thickness, Agilent). Helium was used as a carrier gas, while 

the injector and detector were maintained at 300°C. The oven temperature was programmed for 

60°C (1 min), 30°C min?1 to 120°C, 5°C min?1 to 250°C, and 20°C min?1 to 300°C (2 min). 

Identification and quantification of FAMEs (total ion mode) were performed by comparing the 

retention times of FAMEs samples with an external standard (Supelco 37 Component FAMEs 

Mix, Sigma-Aldrich) and further confirmed by comparison of the MS spectra. For 

quantification purposes, a separate calibration curve was generated for each of the FAMEs in 

the standard.

2.3. Liquid Tri-phase System (LTPS) 

In LTPS, we used binary phase system (hexane + water) and separate the total lipids of 

microalgae into three major classes. Hexane is relatively tolerable solvent and water is almost 

green. Crude ethanolic extract of microalgae (1.83 g) was re-suspended in a mixture of hexane 

and water (160 mL, 1:1, v/v) and shaken for 1-3 min. Three phases were observed after mixing 

and, especially after centrifugation (5,000 rpm, 20oC, and 10 min) (Scheme 2.3): the upper 

hexane phase, the middle colloidal phase and the lower water phase. The mixture was then 

filtrated. The colloidal fraction was left on filter paper and the filtrate containing hexane and 

water phases were collected and repeated for 3-4 times under similar conditions as mentioned 

above; further  transferred to a separating funnel and separated into hexane and water phases as 

shown in Scheme 2.3. 



  

32 
 

The lipid profiles of the hexane, colloidal and water phases were further determined with 

HPLC-ELSD as described in section 2.2.3. The FA compositions of the former two LTPS lipid 

fractions were analysed following the same procedures detailed under section 2.2.4 and the 

water phase was left for future study.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1. Moisture Content and Lipid Extraction 

Lipids were extracted with ethanol from the microalgal paste containing 70.0% (w/w) water. 

N. oculata showed higher ethanol extract yield of 38.2 % (w/w, dry weight (DW)) followed by 

that of P. tricornutum (30.3%), which is in line with the yields reported by Rajvanshi and 

Sharma (2012). This finding for N. oculata is similar to that reported previously for isopropanol 

extracts of the same strain (42.0%) (Gangadhar, et al., 2015) and a modified Bligh-Dyer 

standard extract (39.1%) (Bondioli, et al., 2012); however, other author’s obtained lower yields 

for ethanolic extract (22.0%) (Wang &amp;amp; Wang, 2012). Similarly, the result reported for P. 

tricornutum (20-30%) is in line with (Singh, Carlson, Fell, &amp;amp; Poolman, 2015); but not to 

Gangadhar et al.(2015) whose result was (37.0%). In general, ethanolic extraction provided 

better or nearly the same yield as standard method (Bligh-Dyer) for lipid extraction for different 

microalga strains such as Picochlorum sp , Selenastrum rinoi  and others (Bligh &amp;amp; Dyer, 1959; 

Petrick, et al., 2013; Fangfang Yang, et al., 2014).  

The use of ethanol has several advantages. It is a greener alternative to carcinogenic solvents 

(e.g., chloroform-methanol or hexane commonly used for lipid extraction); being a food-grade 

solvent, it enables the use of product or by-product in food and/or feed applications in the 

interest of spent biomass; it minimizes the high energy intensive dewatering costs (Brennan &amp;amp; 

Owende, 2010; Lardon et al., 2009; P. D. Patil, Gude, et al., 2012) as extraction can be done 

directly from wet biomass; high lipid yields can be obtained at ambient temperature (ethanol 

reflux temperature, 78.5oC) or room temperature (Fangfang Yang et al., 2014) unlike biomass 

gasification (1000oC) or hydrothermal liquefaction (300oC) or flash pyrolysis (Brennan &amp;amp; 

Owende, 2010). Physical pre-treatments for example sonication or microwaves can be avoided 

to induce cell lysis, which if employed acquire additional costs, are not essential and instead 

extracting for duplicate is sufficient. It was also reported that physical pre-treatments are not 

mandatory and extraction twice is sufficient for maximum lipid recovery using methanol: 

chloroform (1:1, v/v) (Ryckebosch et al., 2012).

3.2. Lipid Characterization 

3.2.1. Lipid Profiles 

The total lipids extracted from microalgae were separated into lipid classes (i.e. NLs, GLs and 

PLs) using silica gel column chromatography. Lipid class distribution (% w/w, total lipids (TL)) 

of N. oculata was 45.1, 22.1 and 32.8% for NLs, GLs and PLs, respectively (Fig 3.1). These 

results are in agreement with the findings of Wang and Wang (2012) for the same strain and of 

Fangfang Yang et al.(2014) for Picochlorum sp. And, P. tricornutum lipid distribution was 

23.2, 49.1 and 27.7% for NLs, GLs and PLs, respectively (Fig 3.1). This result is in line with 

the report of Miranda et al. (2015) for the same microalgae strain. It contains more GLs but less 

NLs than N. oculata. The PLs contents of both strains are nearly the same. 

 

Fig. 3.1. N. oculata and P. tricornutum lipid classes separated by silica gel column 

chromatography. NL-neutral lipid, GL-glycolipid, PL-phospholipid 

 

HPLC-ELSD was used to determine the lipid fractions present in the microalgae crude extracts 

and in the fractions separated by silica gel column chromatography (i.e., NLs, GLs and PLs). 

In this regard, we achieved the separation of standards TAG, DAG, FA, MG and PLs in just 40 

minutes (Fig. 3.2). The more non-polar, TAG, was eluted first, followed by DAG, FA and 

MAG. PLs were the last to elute in this gradient program.

Crude Extract 

The newly developed program fairly resolved N. oculata NLs such as TAG, DAG, FA and 

MAG (Fig.3.3). Closely related finding was reported for Chlorella and C. kessleri  (Jones, et 

al., 2012; Kobayashi et al., 2013) and marine zooplankton (Graeve &amp;amp; Janssen, 2009). However, 

there are unidentified fractions which need more standards and further analysis. GLs was 

separated well; but necessitates standard to identify the fraction types.  

On the other hand, the PLs fractions have very close retention times and a full separation would 

require further method optimization. Despite the peaks need further resolution, it is possible to 

ascertain that we achieved to obtain a NLs fraction free of polar lipids for biodiesel production; 

and at the same time, a polar lipids rich fraction for value added chemicals (Fig. 3.4 to 3.6).

Figure 3.4 confirms the separation of NLs from both PLs and GLs in the fractions obtained 

from silica gel column chromatography.

37 
 

The area percentage of NLs was 42.2%, which is close to the one estimated from column 

chromatography (45.1%). The amounts of TAG, DAG, FA and MAG in NLs were 48.2, 8.51, 

12.1 and 13.9%, respectively. TAG is the dominant fraction in NL. The remaining 17.3% were 

unidentified lipids.  

Figure 3.5 confirms separation of the GLs from both the NLs and PLs by silica gel column 

chromatography. GLs accounted for 22.1% of N. oculata total lipids. GLs can be converted to 

non-ionic biosurfactants (Abdel-Mawgoud, et al., 2011; Kitamoto, et al., 2002). Biosurfactants  

are less toxic and biodegradable compared to their chemical counterparts (Kitamoto, et al., 

2002). They have prompted applications in the food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical industries and 

environmental protection (soil washing, oil spills cleaning) (Kitamoto, et al., 2002).  

On the contrary, nonylphenol ethoxylate and other alkylphenol ethoxylates are widely used 

non-ionic surfactants. They are converted in the environment to nonylphenol. Nonylphenol is 

an endocrine disruptor with estrogenic activity via mimicking female sex hormone (Ying, 

Williams, &amp;amp; Kookana, 2002). They are bioaccumulative, therefore, finding alternative, safer, 

renewable and after use degradable surfactants is vital. 

 

                             Fig. 3.5. HPLC-ELSD chromatogram of the GLs fraction of N. oculata 

PLs were also well separated from the remaining lipids by silica gel column chromatography 

and accounted for 33.0% of the whole lipids (Fig.3.6).  The main advantages of separating NLs 

from polar lipids in general and PLs in particular were detailed under section 1.5. Their wider 

applications were further elaborated in section 3.3.

3.2.2. Fatty Acid Composition 

FAs composition of the crude lipid extract and the NLs fraction were calculated in terms of 

total fatty acids (TFA). The main FAs detected in crude extract of N. oculata were myristic acid 

(C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), palmitoleic acid (C16:1), and EPA (C20:5) (Table 3.1). This 

finding is in line with those reported previously (Bellou, et al., 2014; Gangadhar, et al., 2015). 

SFAs and MUFAs account for more than 58.0%. These FAs are suitable for biodiesel as they 

are less susceptible to oxidation. The remaining PUFAs like  EPA (30.6%) are needed to be 

separated and optimized for industrial production for biomedical feed and/or food as nutritional 

supplements (Drevon, Baksaas, &amp;amp; Krokan, 1993; Simopoulos, 1999).  

The major FAs detected in the NLs fraction of N. oculata were C16:0, C16:1 and C18:1 (Table 

3.1). In this fraction, the sum of SFAs and MUFAs are greater than 86.0%. This implies that 

NLs contain less PUFAs; therefore, it is more suitable for biodiesel production than crude 

extract which is more prone to oxidation due to 42.0% PUFAs it contains.

Similarly, the main FAs found in the crude extracts of P. tricornutum were C14:0, C16:0, C16:1 

and C20:5 (Table 3.2). These results are closely related to Ryckebosch et al.(2012) and 

Gangadhar et al.(2015). The sum of SFAs and MUFAs are greater than 71.0%. These FAs are 

suitable for biodiesel as they are less susceptible to oxidative instability. Therefore, the 

remaining PUFAs like  EPA (22.6%) has to be separated and optimized for industrial 

production for feed and/or food or biomedical applications (Drevon, et al., 1993; Simopoulos, 

1999). N. oculata crude extract has more EPA than P. tricronutum crude extract. But, NLs 

fraction of P. tricronutum has twice more EPA than N. oculata NLs fraction. 

The dominant FAs in NLs were C16:0, C16:1 and C18:1 (Table 3.2). The sum of SFAs and 

MUFAs are greater than 82.5%. The implication is NLs comprise less PUFAs and; therefore, 

it is suitable candidate for biodiesel production than directly from crude extracts.

3.3.1. Lipid Classes 

Figure 3.7 shows the partition of the studied microalgae lipids partitioned between the used 

binary solvent system (hexane and water). Three phases (upper hexane, middle colloidal and 

bottom water) were observed after mixing; but centrifugation enhanced the formation of the 

three distinct phases. The yields of the different fractions were, for N. oculata, 27.4, 53.4 and 

19.2% for the hexane, colloidal and water phases, whereas for P. tricornutum, 30.6, 55.4 and 

14.0%, respectively (Fig. 3.7).  

The colloidal phase was further separated using silica gel column chromatography. It was 

composed of 5.1, 23.4 and 71.5% of NLs, GLs and PLs, respectively for N. oculata. Similarly, 

P. tricornutum colloidal consisted of 3.0, 28.7, and 68.3% of NLs, GLs and PLs, respectively. 

These results reveal that  the colloidal phase is a rich source of PLs.

HPLC-ELSD was used also to analyse the lipid classes of LTPS fractions of N. oculata (i.e., 

hexane, colloidal and water phases) (Fig 3.8 to 3.10). In the hexane fraction (Fig. 3.8), more 

than 93.7% was composed of NLs and the remaining with PLs (6.3%). GLs were not detected 

and the PLs fractions are not significant. As a result, the hexane phase is suitable aspirant to be 

used for biodiesel production as it is almost free from polar lipids.

                      Fig. 3.8. Lipid classes composition of the hexane fraction (LTPS) of N. oculata 

 

The lipid classes profile of the colloidal fraction is presented in Fig. 3.9. The approximate area 

percentages were 8.6, 27.8 and 63.5 for NLs, GLs and PLs, respectively. This was a similar to 

those obtained from column chromatography (which were 5.1, 23.4, and 71.5 for NLs, GLs and 

PLs, respectively). This indicates that the colloidal phase was composed of more polar lipids 

particularly PLs. Hence, this phase can be used for other value added products such as liposome, 

aquaculture feed or biomedical applications (Drevon, et al., 1993; Simopoulos, 1999). In this 

regard, the contributions of the present study are to introduce the new amphiphilic or 

amphipathic phase, the colloidal phase of wider industrial applications, partitioned between the 

non-polar hexane upper phase and the polar water lower phase.

                   Fig. 3.9. Lipid classes composition of the colloidal fraction (LTPS) N. oculata 

 

The lipid profile of the water phase is presented in Fig 3.10. These fractions appeared only in 

PLs of the chromatograms. These lipids might be highly hydrolysed PLs fractions (e.g., LPC). 

It might be sugar and/or peptides. Despite logical conclusion that they are polar (by principle 

of like dissolves like), scientific conclusion demands concrete evidence.  Such polar lipids can 

be used to produce bioalchols (Chen et al., 2013). However, this has been left for further 

investigation as standards are essential and attention was given to the two phases (i.e., hexane 

and colloidal) to study their FAs profiles using GC-MS. But, this is an indication of applying 

biorefinery scheme by using the whole lipids for several kinds of applications.

                        Fig. 3.10. Lipid classes composition of the water fraction (LTPS) N. oculata 

3.3.2. Fatty Acid Composition 

GC-MS analysis for fatty acid profiles was done only for the hexane and colloidal fractions as 

the water phase contained insignificant amount of lipids in the PLs region. Because the principal 

objective is biodiesel production from NLs. Besides, a great focus was given to polar lipid rich 

fractions (i.e., colloidal enriched in PLs and GLs) due to their economic value and high demand 

in world market for liposome, nutritional supplement to infant formula and biosurfactants as 

well. Despite this fact, bioethanol produced from the water phase can further reduce the cost of 

biodiesel from microalgae under the biorefinery scheme. As a result, it is utterly recommended 

for future study. Furthermore, the spent biomass can be utilized as feed for food in aquaculture 

or for biogas or bio-fertilizer to complete the biorefinery concept.  

Table 3.3 shows the main FAs detected in N. oculata. Hexane phase FAs were C14:0, C16:0, 

C16:1 and C18:1. The sum of SFAs and MUFAs in this phase was more than 88.0%. This has 

a lot of advantages for biodiesel production from NLs than crude extract. Foley et al. (2011) 

states highly unsaturated lipids occur more frequently in polar lipid fractions specifically PLs. 

So, separating the polar lipids from neutral lipids can also enhance the biodiesel quality (i.e, 

reduce the oxidation) and  thus increase the yield of FAMEs (Freedman, et al., 1984; Y. Li, et 

al., 2014; Watanabe, et al., 2002). Furthermore, it helps to comply with specifications such as 

EN 14214 and ASTM D6751 standards for phosphorus content should be less than 4ppm 

according to EN 14214 or 10ppm as per ASTM D6751 specifications (Kaleli, 2001; Tyson &amp;amp; 

McCormick, 2006).   



  

45 
 

The colloidal fraction contains some FAs as in hexane phase (Table 3.3). However, it consists 

of 43.2% of PUFAs such as C20:5, C20:4 and C18:2. As a result, while the hexane phase can 

be used for biodiesel, the colloidal is able to be used in the treatment of atherosclerosis, cancer, 

and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s because it contains omega-3-FAs (Drevon, 

et al., 1993; Simopoulos, 1999). It can also be used for infant formula nutritional supplement 

because of arachidonic acid (Sijtsma &amp;amp; De Swaaf, 2004; Simopoulos, 1999) and aquaculture 

feed (Brennan &amp;amp; Owende, 2010; Pulz &amp;amp; Gross, 2004; Spolaore, et al., 2006). In addition, it 

contains conditionally essential FAs like linoleic acid (C18:2). This is an attempt to apply the 

bio-refinery scheme so that microalgae can be competitive feedstock for biodiesel. 

This finding shows LC-PUFAs occur more frequently in polar lipid fractions specifically 

colloidal phase containing both PLs and GLs. This is in line with Foley et al.(2011) who 

reported unsaturated FAs are related to polar lipids specially PLs . For example, EPA in P. 

tricornutum is mainly associated with PLs and GLs (Ryckebosch, et al., 2012). Such FAs are 

available in very few organisms such as fish oil. However, considerable evidences have 

indicated that n-3-PUFAs in fish oils are actually derived via the marine food chain from 

zooplankton consuming n-3-PUFAs synthesising microalgae; fish accumulates pollutants up 

food chain and fish oil is with unpleasant smell (Yongmanitchai &amp;amp; Ward, 1989).Therefore, 

microalgae are some of the most promising feedstock for biofuels and/or biomaterials. Other 

applications of PLs fractions include improving intelligence and  function of nerve cells (J. Li, 

et al., 2015; Pepeu, et al., 1996). Therefore, it is very important to separate let alone the general 

lipid classes even each lipid fractions with in the classes to get wider applications from each 

chemical or compound entity. 

In addition, EPA and DHA have the ability to influence cell membrane fluidity and permeability 

(Burri, et al., 2012). These omega-3-FAs are rarely available in higher plants lipids but 

microalgae PLs are enriched in these FAs (Ryckebosch, et al., 2012). This implies that PLs 

from microalgae can deliver both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs to the target site as 

microalgae contain both non-polar and polar lipids. Such PLs liposomes have many advantages: 

targeting, tissue compatibility, reducing drug toxicity and improving its stability. Consequently, 

such liposomes can serve as the carriers of antitumor, antifungal, analgesic, in gene therapeutics 

and vaccines (Delalat, et al., 2015; J. Li, et al., 2015; Pattni, et al., 2015).

as mean ± standard deviation (n = 2) 

 

 

 

 

Similarly, Table 3.4 shows the main FAs detected in P. tricronutum. Hexane phase FAs were 

mainly C16:0, C16:1 and C18:1 (Table 3.4). The sum of SFAs and MUFAs in this phase was 

more than 82.5%. These FAs are good for biodiesel as they are less prone to oxidation when 

compared with PUFAs which contains more unsaturated bonds.  

The colloidal phase contains C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1 and C20:5 (Table 3.4). These support 

that the EPA in both strains (N. oculata = 26.3%; P. tricronutum = 23.0%) can be separated and 

optimized for industrial scale production using LTPS.

4. CONCLUSIONS 

 

? Ethanol successfully extracts lipids from wet microalgae biomass. This can reduce the 

high dewatering cost  

? Neutral lipids can be obtained free of polar lipids (i.e. colloidal = phospholipids + 

glycolipids) to produce biodiesel from microalgae and, at the same time, polar rich 

fractions can be separated for value added products. 

? Neutral lipids comprise fatty acids suitable for biodiesel production but the colloidal 

phase contains fatty acids suitable for biomedical or feed or food applications. 

 

RECOMMENDED FUTURE STUDIES 

? Comparative study of physicochemical properties of biodiesel from microalgae total 

lipids and its NLs fraction. 

? Conversion of GLs fraction to non-ionic bio-surfactant and characterization of its 

suitability for food or pharmaceutical industries. 

? Characterization of colloidal phase for liposome as drug delivery system or infant 

formula additives. 

? Carry out life cycle assessment (LCA) or cost benefit analysis (CBA) of microalgae 

bio-refinery in comparison to petro-refinery.
