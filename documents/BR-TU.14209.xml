Abstract 
 

Title: Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

Author: Diogo Gonçalo Simões Antão 

After a little more than 30 years of existence, in 2008 the cooperative Retalis faced one of the biggest crisis 

since its foundation. Some of its associates, dissatisfied with the service were leaving the company. There were 

also unsatisfied end-consumers with the lack of effectiveness and the waiting time of the service. The internal 

problems aligned with a general economic crisis, rising of oil prices and the growth of the largest competitor 

(Autocoope) led Retalis president to propose the adoption of a new allocation of services system, the GSM/GPRS 

system.  

The company’s deadlock in 2008 offers then a series of discussion possibilities on courses of strategy or 

innovation. In addition to the case study, the dissertation also includes a literature review that contains the 

suggested concepts and frameworks that can be used to analyze and assess the company’s situation, internal 

and external environment and the new technology adoption impact. Finally the teaching note suggests an 

approach to the case that might be used to guide a class discussion or the preparation of it. 

Through the case analysis it is possible to conclude that the adoption of the GSM/GPRS system can be 

optimal because it would improve Retalis performance and, above all, create a source of competitive advantage 

over competitors in the taxi industry. However, there were also some threats and barriers for the new system 

adoption like the economic crisis, the associates characteristics and a deeply rooted working culture. The strategy 

of the new system adoption will only succeed if the company is able to motivate most of its associates and to 

raise awareness of this change through a marketing campaign.   

Resumo 
 

Título: Retalis, Cooperativa Rádio Táxis Lisboa: O declínio na indústria do táxi 

Autor: Diogo Gonçalo Simões Antão 

Após pouco mais de 30 anos de existência, a cooperativa Retalis enfrentava em 2008 uma das maiores 

crises desde a sua fundação. Alguns dos seus associados, insatisfeitos com o serviço prestado estavam a 

abandonar a empresa e existia igualmente uma procura de clientes insatisfeita com a eficácia do próprio serviço 

e o tempo de espera para ter um táxi a sua porta. Os problemas internos alinhados a toda uma crise económica 

geral, o aumento dos preços do petróleo e o crescendo de associados pela maior concorrente Autocoope fizeram 

o seu presidente propor a adopção de um novo sistema de atribuição de serviços, o sistema GSM/GPRS.  

A situação de impasse da empresa em 2008 oferece então uma série de possibilidades de discussão em 

cadeiras de estratégia ou de inovação. Para além do caso de estudo, a dissertação inclui também uma revisão 

de literatura que contém a sugestão de conceitos e ferramentas que podem ser utilizados para analisar e avaliar 

a situação da empresa, o ambiente interno, externo e o impacto da adopção de uma nova tecnologia. Por último, 

a nota de ensino sugere uma abordagem ao caso que poderá servir de base a uma discussão em aula ou 

preparação para a mesma.  

Através da análise do caso, é possível concluir que a adopção do sistema GSM/GPRS poderá ser óptima 

pois iria melhorar a performance e acima de tudo criar uma vantagem competitiva para com os competidores na 

indústria do táxi. Contudo também existiam algumas ameaças e entraves há adopção deste novo sistema como 

a crise económica, as características dos associados e toda uma cultura de trabalho extremamente enraizada. A 

estratégia de adoptar o novo sistema só terá sucesso se a empresa for capaz de motivar maior parte dos seus 

associados e através de uma campanha de marketing dar a conhecer esta mudança.

Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry

I. Introduction 

For more than thirty years, Retalis, the cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa has been 

competing in the taxi competitive industry and was the industry leader for several years. In 

the beginning of 2008, the company had 1.316 million Euros in annual revenues and 

continued to be the largest Portuguese taxi cooperative and the market leader, despite 

working only in the Lisbon area. But the company’s situation had been worsening in the last 

years and several challenges had appeared: the costs have been increasing, there were 

service problems, several members were leaving the company, the information systems 

were outdated and one of the main competitors, Autocoope, was growing, threatening 

Retalis leadership. The President Eng. Jose Dionisio and his team had too much to do, so 

they proposed the adoption of a new system for the company that would solve some of the 

problems in their perspective. 

This dissertation aims then to analyze the company’s performance in the market and also 

to discuss the adoption of the GSM/GPRS system and its implications for the future of 

Retalis. The Case Study (II) offers the opportunity for business strategy students to analyze 

and discuss two main issues: how the service provided by Retalis to both associates and 

clients was working and how the shift to a more recent system could help the company to 

solve its problems. The result of the analysis, both individually and in class, enables to 

address the key issue of the case: should Retalis adopt the GSM/GPRS system? 

However, the goal of this thesis is not only do describe Retalis but also to suggest, 

through a Literature Review (III), the theoretical frameworks and concepts that might be used 

in the study of the case. Finally, the dissertation includes a Teaching Note (IV) with a detailed 

examination of Retalis past and future challenges with the aim of helping the instructor 

preparing and enhancing the class discussion. 

If the adoption of the GSM/GPRS will bring a solution for the Retalis main problems only 

time will tell. However, students may analyze and suggest what the company should do 

regarding the new system adoption.

The decline in the taxi industry 

 

In the beginning of 2008, Radio Taxis Lisboa or Retalis was the largest Portuguese 

cooperative company in the Taxi Industry with annual revenues of 1.316 million Euros. 

Operating only in the Lisbon area (a city with more than 2.5 million habitants where more 

than 1 million cars circulate daily, exhibit 1 and 2), it had almost 50% of the market. However 

it only represented 22% of the number of taxis in Lisbon since there were 1810 cars that 

belonged to individual owners or private associations. Retalis only had 790 cars from the 

total of 1740 that had a radio system. Despite the leadership in the market they were facing 

many challenges: the costs had been increasing year after year, there was a problem in 

service, several members were leaving the company and the information systems were 

outdated. Moreover, one of their main competitors, Autocoope, was growing in the number of 

cars and also in the number of services provided per day. 

Eng. Jose Dionisio, the new president had much to worry about, including the need to 

improve the 30 year old business system. He entered the company in 2006 as a member of 

the financial board and tried to implement a couple of changes with no success, since he 

was only the treasurer. Most of his ideas were not even approved within his team. Convinced 

that he could contribute more to benefit the company, he broke out with the previous 

direction and formed his own team for the elections of 2008. And he won them. 

He knew that something needed to change at the company but it would not be easy. 

There was a deeply rooted work culture since some of the members had more than thirty 

years of affiliation. The new technology systems were an opportunity that should be 

explored, having in mind, as Eng. Jose Dionisio said that:  

“Technology is not an end, only a mean to an end. And that end is to please the people 

that are involved with the company, from the customer to the taxi drivers and owners and the 

operators. It is necessary to show them that the change is positive to everyone”.

Company History 

 

The cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa (Retalis) was formed in 1977 by 50 partners that had 

the ultimate goal of being the leader in the taxi transportation industry. The formation of this 

cooperative was a response to the creation of another one two years before (Autocoope), 

which was created by the members of the union of the taxi drivers. Autocoope had, at that 

time, the ultimate idea of creating a radio taxi service. It was possible for the customers to 

call for a taxi for the wanted address with no need to get out into the streets looking for one. 

This innovative service was having great results and the other drivers that did not belong to 

the company felt the need to create a similar service in order to have higher revenues, since 

it was not possible for the drivers that did not belong to the union, to be a part of the venture.  

Retalis had a decentralized hierarchy (exhibit number 3), with three main divisions 

including the Direction responsible for the management of the company, the audit committee 

that was in charge of the accounting and the general assembly that represented the taxi 

owners in the company and was responsible for managing the board meetings and 

addressing the associates grievances and requests. 

The initial investment made by the partners in the acquisition of the equipment was 

around 46.000 escudos (230 Euros in the current currency) besides the cost of setting up the 

company. It was an high investment for that time and some of the partners could not arrange 

the money to buy it. Of the 50 members that formed the company only 10 had the possibility 

to buy the radio system.  

Despite the initial setback that the company went through in its first year of operation, it 

was able to provide on average 4 services per car per day over the new radio service out of 

a total of 30 services. Most of Retalis taxis work 24 hours per day, with two shifts of 12 hours 

of each driver. Watching the results, other taxi micro-companies started to join the company. 

In 1986 the number of cars was five times higher than in the beginning, with a total of 250 

cars. Each one was performing on average 38 services per day, 7 of them from the radio 

service. Since throughout that year, the 250 existing cars were more than enough to respond 

to the radio generated demand, and new members were not accepted for a year. 

After that year, new entrances were allowed again and in 1991 there were already 410 

cars in Retalis, which represented a growth of 82% in only four years. In the same year the 

Radio Taxis Lisboa social found was created, for which each car had to contribute with 3400 

escudos (17 Euros in the actual currency). The found aimed to assist the members of the 

company in case of a big damage of their cars or if the acquisition of a new one was 



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry

necessary. This support was granted through a very low interest loan (1% interest per 

month). 

In 1994 a new type of revenue for the car owners was introduced. For the first time in 

Portugal, some of the Retalis cars showed in their exterior an advertisement for the new 

Renault Twingo that had just been launched in the Portuguese market. This allowed the 

drivers to have extra revenue per month besides the regular services that they were 

delivering. With a strategy of supporting their members and giving them new ways of making 

money, Retalis became an attractive company to work for and in the beginning of the new 

millennium there were already 650 cars working with the company. The maximum number of 

affiliates was reached in 2006: 825 cars. Each car had on average 28 services per day, 8 of 

them generated by the radio service. The average revenue was 7 Euros per service. 

Although the company had been growing since its foundation, there were two external 

factors concerning the entire industry. The increase of the oil prices in the last years and the 

beginning of an apparent world economic crises. In order to protect the company and its 

members an agreement was signed with the multinational gas company BP. The members of 

Retalis were entitled a discount of 6 cents per liter, while the company got one additional 

cent per liter. This was a way of making the members happy by saving some money and at 

the same time increasing the revenues of the company.  

Despite the effort of the company, the price of oil continued to grow (as it can be seen in 

exhibit 4), and the world economic crisis had really started, making the taxi industry less 

profitable for the players and less attractive to new entrants. With the crisis and the high 

costs of parking in some areas the population also began to circulate more on public 

transportation such as Carris buses and Metro subways to save some costs (as it can be 

seen in exhibit 5 and 6). Until the entrance of Eng. Jose Dionisio direction, in the beginning of 

2008, there were no more admittance and some of the members started to leave the 

company. The majority of them preferred to continue the activity by their own or by moving to 

another cooperative.  

The Situation in 2008 

 

For the first time in history, the company was not able to grow for the two previous years. 

From the peak (with 825 cars) in the beginning of 2006 to the entrance of the new direction in 

2008 there was no growth in the number of cars at the company. Even worse, there were 

some members leaving, because they felt that there was no return in the fee (30€ per month 



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

5 
 

per car) that they had to pay to the company in order to have the radio system. With fewer 

cars working with the company the revenues went down. All the company revenues are 

directly linked to the number of existing cars, the mensal fees paid, the discount per liter in 

BP gas station, a percentage of the advertisement made by other companies in the cars, and 

also a percentage in the credit service. This credit service consists on agreements to allow 

companies or regular clients to pay the services at the end of the month. Retalis charged an 

extra percentage over the total of the services provided to the different clients.  

One of the main tasks of the company was handling the credit services for the associates. 

It received the payment from clients at the end of each month and then it would repay the 

associate who provided the service. In the end of 2007 the payment of credit services 

reached almost 885.000 Euros. The other big costs of the company were the salaries of the 

central workers, the direction travels and communication (as it can be seen in exhibit number 

7). There were no costs regarding the marketing of the company for the attraction of new 

associates, trusting only in the word of mouth among taxi drivers and clients. 

-Industry competion  

One of Retalis main competitors, Autocoope, had been growing in the past years 

threatening the leadership of the company in the taxi industry (as it can be seen in exhibit 

number 8). Until 1996 Autocoope followed the policy of not let anyone enter in the company 

keeping the exclusivity of it 150 members. The business model of this cooperative was 

completely different from the one used by Retalis: the cars belonged to Autocoope and not to 

micro-companies. So they supported all the costs of the 150 cars, like diesel costs, car 

maintenance and the drivers’ salary. This model of business was completely ineffective and it 

was losing money year after year. With the entrance of the new president the policy had 

changed. He decided to sell the cars to the drivers at a low cost and they were responsible 

for the exploration of the car. They supported the costs and got the revenues, having just to 

pay a mensal fee similar to the value in Retalis. The president also decided that it was 

important to increase the number of cars, so he opened the company to new members. The 

main differences from the Retalis model, was that they did not have to pay an entrance fee to 

join the company but they would not get diesel discounts or other extra benefits. They run a 

marketing campaign among the taxi drivers (something that Retalis never did, trusting only in 

the word of mouth), to attract them to the company. With these measures Autocoope started 

to grow, threatening the leadership of Retalis.

In 2008 there were 3550 taxis working in the Lisbon area, where 790 where from Retalis, 

600 from Autocoope, 350 from Teletaxis (another cooperative) and the remaining from 

individual owners or small groups of associations, like “Taxis do Lumiar” or “Taxis do 

Restelo” 
1
. 

The main difficulty felt by Retails in attracting customers was the expansion of public 

transportation. The economic crisis led the population to prefer public transportation for the 

daily movements along the City. 

In 2002 the bus company Carris started a renewal of its fleet. With this renewal the buses 

became more comfortable, more hygienic, with air conditioning and with more seats. Carris 

not only renewed the buses, but also their distribution. The maximum waiting time anywhere 

in the city was listed to 30 minutes. 

With better buses reaching all parts of the city, whit normal waiting times between buses 

of 7 or 10 minutes, and with convenient links with other mean of transport Carris began to 

gain the trust of customers who saw there an alternative to the use of taxi. 

It was not just Carris that led customers to use public transportation as an alternative to 

taxi. The development of the Metro was another reason. 

In 2008, the Metro had four lines that were divided into several areas covering not only the 

metropolitan area of Lisbon but also areas outside the city as Amadora and Odivelas for 

example. The Metro had become a real choice because it was faster, with little waiting time 

and with stations all along the city. By reaching areas in the suburbs the Metro allowed daily 

trips by customers who did not live in the city center but had to move daily to study or work. 

Car commuters take twice as long to get to the city because of traffic congestion problems. 

Also the costs of using the car daily have been increasing in the last years. The increase of 

oil prices and the increase of parking costs in some Lisbon areas made some people to 

prefer the public transportation instead of the individual car. 

At that time the percentage of people that used public transportation daily was around 

57%. From this percentage only 4% use the taxi while the rest used other means like Metro 

or Carris. Relatively to individual transportation it corresponds to 41%. 

Over the years Retalis had been taking measures targeted to the associates, like the BP 

agreement, the advertisements and other measures, whose main beneficiary was the 

associate himself and not the final customer. The new direction knew that something needed 

to change in the company, and the main questions according to Jose Dionisio were:

“Where to go? What changes should be implemented? Should the company renew the 

whole fleets of taxis? Renew the drivers? Change the way they operate? Or re-think the 

entire philosophy of the company?” 

After an analysis of the company, the new direction identified that the radio system was 

obsolete. It had been the same system over the past 30 years and fewer changes have been 

made since the beginning which made it ineffective for the modern times. There were several 

calls arriving at the central asking for a taxi but it was only possible to find a taxi for one 

customer at a time and the whole procedure could take several minutes. This made some 

customers to be unsatisfied for the time and money spent on the call or even to give up 

waiting. 

-The Radio Taxis phone Service 

Besides the regular taxi service that consists of picking up customers randomly on the 

streets or on the taxi stands, Retalis also provides to its members a radio service that helps 

them to get a service without the need of driving around the city looking for customers.  

This radio service requires a series of steps which involves the customer, a Retalis 

operator and the taxis on duty. Although picking up a taxi for a customer seems a quite 

simple task, it requires background work since the call from the customer until the taxi gets to 

his/her door.  

The first step is done by the customer, when he makes the decision of calling the 

company asking for a taxi to the wanted address. After that the operator takes note of the 

address and announces in the radio that a customer is requiring a taxi into a certain address. 

In this process all the Retalis cars listen to the announcement either if they are available or if 

they are driving a client. 

The next step is taken by the taxi drivers. After listening to the announcement of the 

operator, the cars that are near the address apply for the service, once at a time. In the 

application the driver has to give his location (address where he is) in order for the other 

drivers to know if it is worth to apply for the service, in case they are nearer. Since there is no 

device to ensure that the taxi driver is giving the correct information about his location, the 

only option is to trust the drivers’ word. However, there were several stories of lies, with a 

driver saying that he was in a given location and another one seeing him in a different one. 

This type of events happened a lot of times, which contributed to the image of the taxi drivers 

as being tricky people that do everything to get more money. After the different applications, 

the car that is closer to the client’s address wins the service and drives to meet the customer. 



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

8 
 

At the same time the operator, which is also listening to the taxi radio, communicates to the 

customer that number “xxx” is on the way to meet him. The decision of which is the closest 

car is not always clear. In case of doubt there is a decision commission, chosen in advance, 

composed by other taxi drivers that decide what car should take the required service based 

on the address that they gave before. This commission has the power to replace the car that 

was previously indicated for the service by another one that also applied, if they think that the 

second one is closer to the customer’s address. In this case, when the new car indicated for 

the service arrives has to inform the customer that he comes in place of the taxi number told 

by the operator. From this moment on the steps of the radio service are over and the regular 

service provided by taxis begins. 

This was a long process that required a lot of attention and cooperation between the 

intervenients in order to avoid mistakes and keep the customer satisfied. 

Last year performance showed that the taxi service had stagnated and the average 

number of services, both over the radio and not, were worse than the one´s from twenty 

years ago (according to the information on the exhibit 9). For the maturity of this service 

contributes, according to Eng. Jose Dionisio, “the time spent on the different steps and, most 

of all, because it was only possible to manage one request at a time, creating a funnel effect 

(figure A). With this, there was no possibility of growth with the use of this 30 year-old 

system”.

“The need to adapt the system to the state-of-art technologies was something that should 

be explored. Society was already in the 3G era and the company had stopped 30 years in 

the past”, according to the new president.  

Some electronic systems had already been implemented in other countries with great 

results. The president felt the need to do something similar in his company in order to update 

the system, making it more effective, and to satisfy the customers.  

However, he knew that it would not be easy to implement, because there were associates 

with more than 30 years of affiliation to the company. They were used to work with the old 

system and, with their low level of education, some of the members looked to these new 

technological systems in a distrustful and skeptical way. It was necessary to show them that 

this would be a good investment that would be profitable in the future because it will allow 

them to generate more services and with that more revenues. Taxi drivers were not the only 

ones who would be affected by the changes. It was necessary to show to the operators and 

the remaining employees that nobody was going to lose their jobs and, on the contrary, their 

work would be facilitated. 

-The GSM/GPRS system 

Before the decision of what should be implemented, several systems were analyzed in 

order to see which one had the functionalities that would fit better with the characteristics of 

the company and its culture. Also the system should be an easy one to work with, because of 

the type of people that were going to use it.  

The chosen system was the GSM/GPRS, a system that included treating information over 

mobile voice (listen and speak, GSM) and data on the same electronic band (GPRS). This 

was a user friendly system that had already been implemented in Madrid some years ago.  

The treatment of the information provided by all the intervenients would be treated 

electronically, instead of the voice in the previous system. The first step would be made by 

the customer, when he/she calls Retalis asking for a taxi to a certain address. After hearing 

the customer, the operator just had to input in the system the address and it would 

automatically identify the nearest free car over the GPS system. Then the number of the car 

that is going to pick him/her is communicated to the customer. The next time that the 

customer calls from the same number the system would automatically identify the address 

from the previous call (each number can have up to 6 addresses register). 

When the system identifies the closest car it shows up in that car system device the 

information of the address of the client and the driver has 20 seconds to press the button to 

accept the service. If in 20 seconds the driver does not press any button, the system

automatically passes the service to the second nearest car and so on. With this new system 

it would be possible to find a car for a customer in seconds instead of minutes, allowing the 

client to save time and money on the call. At the same time, this new system will eliminate 

the funnel effect of the previous system, since it would be possible to assign more than one 

service at a time, making the radio service at Retalis more effective. 

Because this was a system that would be expensive to implement, and since it was a 

cooperative venture, it was necessary to approve the proposal in the general meeting with 

more than 50% of the votes from the associates. The implementation of the new system 

would cost 1 million Euros divided by the different associates (1400 Euros per car), so it was 

necessary to show them that the investment would be worth it in the near future.  

What to do next? 

 

There was a need to change. It was necessary to stop members to resign and to attract 

more associates to the company. In the past years, the main focus of the company was to 

please the associates, making agreements to get them more revenues or to reduce their 

costs. This new direction was proposing a different approach. It was necessary to think about 

the clients and their satisfaction in order to get more services and revenues for the 

associates.  

In this new point of view the GSM/GPRS system was the right way to go. This new system 

would allow the elimination of the company bottleneck and provide a better service for the 

client, with no need of staying several minutes on the phone waiting for the service to be 

attributed. Instead, in some seconds, it was possible to know the car number that was on the 

way to the required address. In Eng. Jose Dionisio opinion: “This was an opportunity that 

should be taken, and by being the first cooperative to adopt this service, we would get a first-

mover advantage which is very important in every business”. 

However, the implementation of the service was not going to be easy. There were several 

associates against it: the fear of the change, the work style deeply rooted and the investment 

needed for the change were the main reasons for the doubts about the adoption of the 

service. Also most of the people that were in the Taxi business (taxi owners and workers) 

had low-medium college instruction and were old. They look for the new technologies with 

distrust. It was necessary to show to the taxi owners that with this service it was possible to 

increase the revenues and reduce the empty kilometers (traveled without clients, exhibit 10) 

and show to the taxi drivers that their average salary of 700 Euros could increase.

11 
 

Moreover, Retalis was a cooperative enterprise with hundreds of associates and it was 

hard to convince all of them about the advantages of the new system. And the ones that 

were against the new system and the investment of almost 1 million Euros were free to leave 

the company and join another cooperative or work by their own. Large investments were 

feared mainly because of the crisis that was felt at national level. Also it was necessary to 

give training to every taxi driver, taxi owner and operator in the period of transition to the new 

service.  

The president knew that some members were against the new system and they would 

leave the company if the proposal was accepted. So he asked himself several questions: 

“Should we move to this system or try to find a less expensive one? Is this the right time to 

implement the system? Or should we move to a different kind of restructuring?” 

Despite the threats, innovation and the possibility of growth were an opportunity that the 

direction did not want to miss.

III. Literature Review 

1. Competitive advantages and Strategic Management 

 

The strategy of a company is based on a balanced and rational management of its 

resources to create competitive advantages that enable the creation of value. Only, through 

a strategic positioning it will be possible to obtain products or services that will satisfy the 

customer’s needs and desires in a better way than the competition, according to Michael 

Porter (1996). 

A strategy is needed to promote consistency, define an organization, reduce uncertainty, 

be ahead of competition, and involve everyone in the company and most of all to define the 

direction to go, according to Mintzberg (1987). According to this author, there are five 

dimensions for a strategy that complement each other and help in the clarification of the 

concept. The dimensions are: 

1. Strategy as a plan: A set of guidelines to be followed for a specific situation. In this 

case, the strategy is developed in a purposeful and conscientious way and is done 

before the actions to which it applies are carried out; 

 

2. Strategy as a ploy: A set of maneuvers that aim to overcome a competitor; 

 

3. Strategy as a pattern: It emerges from the adopted behaviors, whether they are 

intentional or not; 

 

4. Strategy as a position: The way that the company is positioned in its environment. 

The strategy thus become the mediating force between the internal and the 

external context of the company; 

 

5. Strategy as a perspective: The way that the company looks to the world around it. 

The vision is shared between all the employees, through their actions and 

intentions. 

 

To define a strategy it is necessary to understand the long-term goals and objectives of 

the company, taking into account the environment in which it operates. Basically you should 

try to understand what is the way that the company wants to follow, taking into account its 



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

19 
 

resources and internal operations, and external factors of its environment like economics and 

demographics, political legal, socio-cultural, technological and ecological , among others. 

Most of the companies develop their management based on the budget and operational 

plan, focusing only in the financial performance. With the several economical and social 

changes, and with competition based on information, the capacity of exploring intangible 

assets has become much more important than the capacity of managing tangible assets. 

The management tools must provide all the elements that enable the identification and 

sustainability of the competitive advantages of the company, in an environment that is 

constantly changing and is very competitive. 

Thomas Wheelen and J. David Hunger (2006), consider that strategic management 

involves four steps: financial planning, external guidance, forecasting and the strategy 

planning. On the other hand strategic management includes other four fundamental 

elements: environmental analysis, strategy formulation, strategy implementation and 

monitoring and control. 

2. Environmental analysis 

2.1 PESTEL Analysis 

The internal and external environment should be examined in a thorough way, because 

only in that way it is possible to define a global strategy for the company. For Thomas 

Wheelen e J. David Hunger (2006), the external environment analysis could be done through 

a PESTEL analysis, which will help identify the external factors that influence the 

performance of the company in the market.  

-Political: Policies on the political framework where the company is involved; 

-Economical: economical and demographic factors that influence the company; 

-Social- Life-style: social values and educational level; 

-Technological: evolution of science that influence the company activities and the 

development of new products or processes; 

-Environmental: Involvement and commitment with the environment and social 

responsibility; 

-Legal: Related to the legal environment where the company operates  



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

20 
 

2.2 Porter Five Forces 

For Michael Porter (1980) the essential factor that influences more the company activity is 

the sector of activity where it is inserted or the group of sectors where the company 

competes. The intensity of the competition depends on five forces: bargaining power of 

buyers, bargaining power of suppliers, threat of new entrants, threat of substitutes and rivalry 

among competition.  

According to Michael Porter (1980) the bargaining power of buyers allows them to exert a 

pressure on the sector, making the margins lower and obtaining products and services of 

better quality. This power can be influenced by several characteristics like the number of 

players in the market, having an undifferentiated product or service and the search of better 

prices. 

For Porter (1980), the larger the size of the supplier the greater is the supplier negotiation 

power. The concentration of suppliers, lack of inputs and substitutes and high switching costs 

are conditions that ensure a higher bargaining power of suppliers.   

The threat of new entrants is related to economies of scale, high capital requirements, 

product differentiation, restricted access to distribution channels, technology and specific 

know-how.  

The pressure of substitute products, that have the same use as the product of a particular 

sector that satisfy the same client needs, influences the prices of the industry and its 

importance increases according to the appetence of customers for the substitution. The 

existence of substitute products limits the gains of the companies of that industry, because it 

has to maintain competitive prices. Thereby the degree of attractiveness of the industry 

decreases.  

The rivalry among existing firms is influenced by all the aspects mentioned before. The 

number of competitors, product differentiation, switching costs, exit barriers and the diversity 

of companies are all aspects that condition the competitiveness of an industry. 

2.3 SWOT Analysis 

The internal analysis shows that in most cases, although the market trends are the same 

for the several companies that belong to a certain sector, the results obtained by them are 

different from each other. This situation happens because of the different management 

capabilities of each company and the efficient use of its resources.  



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

21 
 

Thomas Wheelen and J. David Hunger (2006) believe that it is necessary, at an internal 

level, to analyze the core and differentiated competences of each company, in order to 

create competitive advantages and a strong organizational culture. For Mintzberg (1988) we 

should also analyze the company structure, internal resources and competences and the 

culture and operations of the company. In order to achieve success it is necessary to create, 

develop and sustain competitive advantages that allow them to keep the leadership in the 

markets where they operate. In the internal analysis, could be used the SWOT analysis, 

combining the strengths and weaknesses of the company with the threats and opportunities 

of the market. 

3. Strategy formulation 

3.1 Aligned Strategy with Vision and Mission 

It is necessary to know the vision and mission of a company to outline a strategy. The 

vision projects how the company wants to be seen by society while pursuing its mission. It 

influences the performance of the employees that by feeling identified with the goals of the 

company will become more motivated to work there. This will benefit also the performance of 

the company.   

The mission must be seen as a long-term guide of the company, that hardly changes and 

that should not be a specific goal or a strategic action. Every company should have its own 

identity and values. Throughout the definition of strategy, the company establishes its goals 

and the direction that should be taken to achieve those goals. All the goals should be 

measurable, specific, tangible, result oriented and defined in time.  

For Peter Drucker (2000) there are five phenomena that should be considered in the 

formulation of a strategy, because they are the known factors of the external environment. 

These phenomena are a consequence of large changes in the society and they are the new 

parameters in the definition of performance, decreasing of birth rate in the developed 

countries, global competition, lack of accompaniment between the economic globalization 

and politics and the changes in utilization of incomes.  

For Robert Kaplan and David Norton (2000) the companies that are strategy oriented 

should adopt 5 principles: align the strategy with the organization, set the strategy in an 

operational way, involve everyone in the company with the strategy, convert it into a 

continuous process and mobilize the change.  



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

22 
 

3.2 Competitive Advantage 

According to Michael Porter (1980) there are three types of strategies that create 

competitive advantage:  

Cost Strategy: where the company concentrates its efforts in productive efficiency, 

production growth and in minimization of costs like advertising, distribution or R&amp;amp;D. In this 

type of strategy the main advantage is the price that is extremely competitive and is a factor 

of attractiveness for the consumer. On the other hand, the risks of this strategy are the threat 

of new competitors with a more advanced technology that can produce at a lower cost and 

the market can rapidly change and value other features in the product beside the price.  

Differentiation: The Company invests in areas like image, R&amp;amp;D, new technologies or 

quality of a certain product or service in order to differentiate from the competition. The main 

advantage of this strategy is that it creates differentiated criteria recognized in the market, 

which creates value for the product or service. In terms of risks the main ones are the high 

price and possibility of ignoring other criteria of the market.  

Focus: In this strategy the company chooses a restrict target and trough differentiation or 

cost, concentrates its goals in the satisfaction of that specific segment or niche. The main 

advantage is the possibility of identifying clearly the clients and consumers for that product or 

service. On the other hand the chosen segment may not sustain the operation of the 

company.  

4. Strategy Implementation 

 

In order to achieve the five principles suggested, according to Robert Kaplan and David 

Norton (2000) there are some actions that must be developed: the strategy should be 

presented for every worker in the company, in a simple and creative way, in order to motivate 

them and make them work aligned with the defined strategy; it is necessary to align the 

strategy and communication between all the departments of the company, in order to 

achieve common goals; look at the strategy as a learning process in order to get some 

feedback; and make a big effort to do the necessary changes.  

After a careful internal and external analysis of the company and the industry and look at 

the social-political phenomena it is possible to formulate hypothesis and then choose the 

right strategy to follow. 



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

23 
 

With the fast and unexpected economic and social context changes, some authors 

suggest a more intuitive approach and a lower level of planning when the companies have to 

decide which strategy should be implemented. In Gary Hamel (1996) opinion companies 

should take advantage of its core competences in order to achieve the set objectives.  

According to Hamel (1996) the efforts of the companies, in the recent years, have been 

focused on the inside, where its aim is to improve performance and be at the same level of 

the competitors in the competitive parameters. But from this author point of view the 

companies are doing it wrong, they should be trying to achieve better capabilities, which will 

allow creating new markets. Hamel (1996) also defends that competition will influence the 

future business opportunities and do not see it as a player in the sector to split the profits.  

For Hamel (1996) there are two types of companies, the ones that will possible suffer 

some difficulties in the future because they have not adopted significantly changes, and the 

ones that deal well with organizational changes, trying to understand what will happen in the 

future and trying to adapt their strategy to it.  

The managers feel the need to anticipate the changes in the external environment and 

customer’s behavior in order to choose the right strategy for the company. All the decisions 

related to the future prediction are the hardest ones to take. The need to anticipate future 

scenarios generates changes in the organizations (Hayes and Garvin 1982). 

Thomas Wheelen and J. David Hunger (2006) believe that for successful strategies it is 

necessary to define procedures, processes and implement action-oriented programs. 

Throughout the different steps it is necessary to get some feedback, in order to check if the 

implemented strategy is the right one to achieve the goals set by the company.  

4.1. Monitoring and Control 

After the implementation of the strategy comes the monitoring and control. The traditional 

systems in most companies are based on financial indicators that result from the variables 

that were on the budget. These budgets are based on the sales, costs, results and 

profitability which are important information but do not guarantee the future success of the 

company. Through the analysis of non-financial data it is possible to know the customer 

satisfaction, the quality of service provided, the reception level of the market to the 

introduction of a new product and how new technologies are being used, among other 

aspects, whether they are key success factors for the company’s future success (Kaplan and 

Norton, 1996). 



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

24 
 

The measures chosen to evaluate the company performance should be strategically 

relevant, taking into account the future activities and the time and resources allocated to the 

information processing. With monitoring and control of the implemented strategy it is possible 

to know how the strategy is being implemented and if it is going in the right way in order to 

achieve the required goals (Kaplan and Norton, 1996). 

The goal of feedback processes is to know if the set objectives have been achieved, not 

only at the company level, but also at the different departments and employees’ level. These 

processes are extremely useful for the strategy planning, to generate learning and have the 

capacity to improve constantly.  

5. The Relation of Innovation with Business Performance 

 

Technological innovations are a key success factor for the future of the organizations. On 

one hand they are a source of creativity that allows the companies to grow, and on the other 

hand they are a destructive force that can put the company in a dangerous position in 

comparison with its competitors (Utterback, 1994). 

Christensen and Bower (1995) defend that in the business world it is almost impossible for 

a company to remain leader of a certain sector when there is a technological change or a 

market evolution. The market is always evolving and it is essential for companies to 

understand that evolution and create new technologies in order to remain competitive. 

Although it is important to be careful with innovation, it can challenge the current company 

knowledge and positioning in the market.   

For Porter (1985) innovation is also very important for the success of an organization. But 

innovation is not a competitive advantage by itself. It is only a source of generating 

competitive advantages in the company.  

5.1. S-Curve 

The S-curve is a tool frequently used to analyze competition and technological innovation 

(Callahan, 2007). It is extremely useful to understand how technology is performing and 

anticipate when the change for a new one is needed, because every technology has its life-

cycle. And new technologies with better performance are always appearing.  

The S-curve is determined in its vertical axis by the technology performance and in its 

horizontal axis by the effort or money invested in a certain technology, using time to measure 



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

25 
 

them. As the time of implementation goes by the technology performance tends to improve, 

because in the initial state the functionalities are not that well understood and not working at 

its maximum. For Foster (1982) during the initial state the effort is applied in a limited 

technology improvement and then, only when the knowledge is acquired and established, 

progress increases until it reaches the limit. When reaching this limit the improvements start 

to be lower until they drop to zero. When this process is closer to its maturity, it becomes 

more vulnerable and subject to the substitution of a new technology process. 

For Christensen (2003) the S-curve is a useful framework to predict and understand when 

an emerging technology will replace the current technology. The point where it is predicted 

that a new technology will overcome the existing one is called the inflection point of existing 

technology. 

According to Rogers (1995), in its diffusion of innovations theory, there are five categories 

of adopters along the S-curve adoption model. There are the innovators, early adopters, 

early majority, late majority and laggards. By using this model, the company will be able to 

figure out who are the potential adopters and when they will adopt it. By knowing that, the 

company will be able to anticipate market opportunities before the competitors, and focus its 

sales effort according to the adoption level.  

6. The Innovation Adoption from Organizations 

Besides the decision of what technology should be adopted, aligned with the company 

strategy, there is also another important issue that consists on deciding if the company wants 

to be a technological follower or a leader. According to Porter (1985) technological 

leadership consists of being the first to introduce a technological change and, with that, being 

able to support the company’s strategy. 

For Porter (1985) the choice of being the technological follower or technological leader is 

based on three issues: what are the advantages of being the first to adopt a technological 

change; what are the disavantages of moving first to a new technology than competitors; and 

at what extent the leader is able to sustain the technological change over its competitors. 

6.1 New Technology adoption drivers 

Chandy and Tellis (2000) showed in their study how influential companies resist to new 

technologies and how they can loose their leadership quickly after the introduction of a new 

technology in the market that replaces the previously established techonology. There are 



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

26 
 

several reasons for this behaviour like the organizational inertia, too much dependence on 

fixed assets, incorrect assement of the market or pure conservatism.  

As a result of this behavior, incumbent companies tend to react late and invest small 

amounts of money in new techonogies. Usually companies only tend to react to a certain 

problem or need and there are five main factors that might explain the adoption of new 

techonologies and innovation by the firms: 

New Competitors: the entry of new entrepreneurs could facilitate the adoption of new 

technologies because they are less exposed to the interests and routines inherent of an 

industry. Consequently the possibility of a radical change in an industry grows. Christensen 

(1997). Also companies from a different sector can develop a new technology that might give 

them a competitive edge in a different sector.  

External Crisis: According to Hoffman (1999), a crisis can be seen as an “occasional 

event” that interrupts a period of stability and requires the adoption of practices different from 

the ones that are being performed. Crisis are important mechanisms for the adoption of new 

technologies: they create and accelerate the necessity of companies and sectors to develop 

and adapt their activities to new technologies, they offer the opportunity of reflection of the 

current practices and uncertainty makes the companies take more risks in the adoption of 

new technologies.  

New Technology Performance: the third factor that influences the adoption of a new 

technology is the performance and the learning curve of that technology when compared to 

the existing one. Usually new technologies are more expensive and complex than the 

existing ones, but it has a better chance to bring more benefits in the medium-long run 

(Christensen, 1997). 

Changes in the Market: It can occur through the emergence of new alternative 

technologies or as a result of the changing needs of consumers who can demand new 

features in the product or service that they need. The first option is a push strategy, which 

consists in pushing the new technology to the customers. The second one is a pull strategy, 

where the changes in the demand may lead to experimentations with new technologies, 

which over time can break down the existing ones. 

Industry Competitiveness: the competition among the firms of the same sector is also a 

factor that influences the adoption of new technologies. According to Porter (1985) 

technology influences the competitive advantage if it has a significant role in determining a 

cost position or differentiation. So the adoption of new technologies can give the chance of 

winning a competitive advantage over the competitors. 



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

27 
 

6.2- Value Chain 

Despite all the factors that influence the adoption of new technologies it is essential that 

the innovation adopted create value for the clients and for the company. Through the 

analysis of the Value Chain is possible to see how the adoption of a certain technology can 

create that value, in comparison to the value that was provided before the new technology 

adoption.  

The value chain concept was introduced by Porter with the goal of analyzing what are the 

sources of competitive advantage of the company, by examining its different activities in how 

they perform and interact in the different areas. 

According to Porter the value chain should be constructed at the company level and not at 

the industry level. Although some companies within the same industry can have similar value 

chains, they have certain differences and those differences are what create sources of 

competitive advantage.  

For Porter it is through technological and physical activities, which represent value 

activities, that a company creates value for their customers. The value obtained by the 

difference of the total value and the total cost of the value activities performed represent s the 

margin. Both margin and value activities are the total value represented in the value chain.  

In the value chain we have two types of value activities: the primary activities that involve 

the creation of the product, its sale and the after sale support and the support activities that 

support the primary activities and each other by providing the different company functions 

like technology, human resources or purchased inputs. They are subdivided in five 

categories and four activities respectively.  

Regarding the primary activities, they include inbound logistics, operations, outbound 

logistics, marketing, sales and service. For Porter (1985), each of these categories has a 

higher or lower role in the companies’ competitive advantage according to the industry that 

they belong to. On the other hand the support activities are subdivided in procurement, 

technology development, human resources management and firm infrastructure. 

According to Porter (1985) value activities have a key influence in the company’s 

competitive advantage. The way that each activity is performed, aligned with the company 

economics, has an impact on the cost of product or service provided and on whether the 

company has a high or low cost comparing to its competitors. The execution of each activity 

will contribute to the creation of some differentiation when compared to other competitors. 

This difference will determine the competitive advantage of the company.  



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

28 
 

There are several products that do not go directly from a company to the consumer, so 

Porter says that a company value chain is part of a larger system, named The Value Chain 

System. This system relates the value chain of upstream and downstream suppliers. The 

upstream suppliers are the ones that create and deliver inputs to a certain company that 

uses them in its value chain. The downstream suppliers receive the product and deliver it to 

the buyers and the activities performed by them will influence the company activities and the 

buyer’s chain. 

7. Factors that influence the adoption/rejection of innovative 

technologies 

7.1 New technology adoption Steps 

In order to find out what are the factors that influence the adoption/rejection of innovative 

technologies, it is necessary to understand how an innovation spreads along to consumers. 

According to Rogers (1995) the innovation diffuses, first, through the selective 

communication channels and, over time, among the members of the society. For Rogers 

(1995) there are five sequential steps for the adoption of innovations: the first one is the 

acquisition of the necessary information about the innovation; then is the formulation of an 

opinion about it; the third is the decision about the adoption; the fourth implementation of it; 

and finally the review of the decision.  

The second step is the most critical, where according to the perception of the innovation 

characteristics, potential buyers develop an overall opinion about it. The capacity of 

understanding the different features of the innovation contributes to a higher probability of 

adoption. There are five features that represent a huge importance according to Rogers 

(1995): relative advantage, according to its performance and cost; compatibility in terms of 

values and norms; complexity in the difficulty of understanding and use; experimentation, 

regarding the degree where the innovation can be experimented; and the observation, where 

the effects of the adoption are visible. 

7.2 Perceived Risk 

Although in the adoption of an innovation there is always the uncertainty element, and 

there is also the risk that the innovation does not create the expected final benefit or even 

create social and economical losses for the consumer. According to Stone and Grønhaug 



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

29 
 

(1993) there are six interrelated perceived risks that contribute to customer resistance in the 

adoption of a new technology: 

Financial Risk: it represents the probability of the customer losing money when he/she 

acquires the product or service. In fact most consumers are looking for a short payback 

period, when they decide to use more efficient technologies. 

Performance Risk: represents the probability of something going wrong with the 

performance of a certain product or service. The other thing that can happen is that 

customers have certain expectations and if the performance of that product/service does not 

fit, it can damage the company business. 

Physical Risk: reflects the concerns of the customers regarding the safety of a certain 

product or service. 

Psychological Risk: represents the possibility of a product or service not to fit well in the 

life style and personal image of the customers. Most of the consumers still have insufficient 

information about the use of new technologies, which influences its adoption.  

Social Risk: represents the risk that a purchase of certain product or service affects how 

the society will look to the user of it. 

All this five different risks related contribute to another risk that is the possibility of 

adoption of alternative products or services. In the case of the taxi industry there are other 

means of transportation like individual cars, Metro and buses that can substitute the service 

provided by the taxi.

IV. Teaching Note 

1. Case Summary 

Retalis is a cooperative enterprise that was created in 1977 with the major objective of 

being the leader in the taxi transportation industry. Its core competences were mostly related 

with a radio service provided for the different cars in order to help them finding the clients, 

with no need to search for them along the Lisbon streets. 

In the first years of its existence the company was able to grow exponentially and in the 

new millennium it reached 825 cars working with Retalis radio service. However, in the last 

years the company had been threatened, not only by the growth of one its competitors, 

Autocoope, but also by the resigning or quitting of some members that were unsatisfied with 

the company service. Those members were resigning because they perceived that the 

money spent to have Retalis radio service was not useful. In 2008 there were only 790 cars 

in Retalis and the company was providing over the radio on average 8 out of 26 services per 

car per day. For some members the money spent on the monthly fee did not have the 

expected return. 

In 2008 a new direction was elected. Jose Dionisio was the president and he had to make 

a lot of changes in the company. Despite the leadership in the taxi industry, Retalis was 

facing many challenges: some members were leaving the company; the costs had been 

increasing in the last years; the information systems were outdated; there was unsatisfied 

demand; and the main competitor was growing, threatening Retalis leadership. 

The president knew that something had to be done to change the course of the events. So 

he came up with the measure of reformulating the company strategy and the information 

systems. In the past measures were taken to beneficiate the associates by creating 

agreements to reduce their costs or increase their revenues (like the BP agreement to 

reduce the diesel costs or the advertisement campaigns to increase revenues). It was 

necessary to change that; Eng. Jose Dionisio thought that the measures taken should 

beneficiate first the end consumer, and consequently they would also please the associates.  

So to please the customer, Eng. Jose Dionisio realized that the information systems 

should be updated. The radio system that had been used in the last 30 years was completely 

ineffective and there was unsatisfied demand. He did a research and found a GSM/GPRS 

third generation system that could be extremely useful for the company, in a way that it 

would reduce the time spent in the allocation of each service. Instead of the average 5 

minutes in the old system, this new one would allow to allocate a service in 20 seconds.  



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

31 
 

Despite the obvious advantages of the system, the application of it in Retalis was not 

going to be easy. The investment to adopt the new service would cost 1400 Euros by car. 

And with the economic crisis in Portugal the associates did not have that money available to 

spend in the new system. But the factor that most concerned Jose Dionisio was the mentality 

of the associates. There was a work culture deeply rooted where some of the members had 

more than thirty years of affiliation. Most of the members looked at these new technologies 

with distrust and were afraid of change.  

As the company was a cooperative, the members that did not want to adopt the new 

system could leave the company. This would have a huge negative impact in the company, 

because all its revenues were directly linked to the number of working cars.   

So the president was facing a huge dilemma, whether the adoption of the new information 

system would be the right measure to make, taking in consideration that “Technology is not 

an end, only a mean to an end. And that end is to please the people that are involved with 

the company, from the customer to the taxi drivers and owners and the operators. It is 

necessary to show them that the change is positive to everyone” Eng. Jose Dionisio. 

2. Learning objectives 

The Case Study was done to be used in business strategy classes and the Teaching Note 

was designed in a way to allow the instructor to choose the concepts and frameworks that 

should be used in class. But, as it has an innovative component, it might also be interesting 

to analyze the case in a class related to innovation and the impact of new technologies in 

organizations.  

The approach used in the Teaching Note aims to ensure that, after reading and analyzing 

individually and in class the case study, students are able to know how to: 

1- Use common strategic frameworks and concepts to understand and evaluate the 

performance of the company in the industry, namely: 

a) Applying the SWOT and PESTEL analysis to understand how the company is 

performing and the external factors that influence that performance. 

b) Comparing industry attractiveness through the Porter Five Forces analysis. 

c) Understanding through the Value Chain how the company is adding value to both 

associates and end-consumers. 

2- Apply Innovation frameworks and concepts to provide a deeper analysis of the adoption 

of a certain technology, namely: 



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

32 
 

a) Understanding what reasons led the company to change, despite its leadership in the 

market. 

b) Applying the S-curve framework to compare the performance of the used technology 

and the one proposed to implement. 

c) Analyzing the risks inherent in the adoption of a new technology. 

d) Using the Value Chain framework to understand how the new technology can creates 

value to the associates and end-consumers. 

3- Evaluate the dilemma of the company and give different options to adopt for the future. 

3. Suggested assignment questions 

The following questions are guidelines for the students’ preparation of the class. The 

questions are structured for a strategy course, before the adoption of the new technology. 

1) Analyze the internal and external environment of Retalis. 

2) How attractive is the industry where Retalis is?  

3) What are the problems and the dilemmas that the company is facing? What are the 

reasons that lead the company to this scenario? 

4) “Technology is not an end, only a means to an end. And that end is to please the 

people that are involved with the company, from the customer to the taxi drivers and owners 

and the operators. It is necessary to show them that the change is positive to everyone”, 

summarized Jose Dionisio 

Analyze how the adoption of the new technology could create value to the players that are 

involved with the company. 

5) You have been appointed as Vice-President in Jose Dionisio team. And the first 

meeting is about to begin in a few moments. The president wants to know from you the 

analysis of the adoption of the new technology, as well as your recommendations for the 

future of the company.

d) Compare Retalis primary activities with the other taxi cooperative companies in Lisbon. 

Assignment Question 3 

e) Highlight the main issues and problems that were concerning Jose Dionisio and his 

team.  

f) Analyze the reasons that lead the company to propose the adoption of the new 

technology. 

Assignment Question 4 

g) Compare the value that would be added by the adoption of the new technology with the 

value that is currently added. 

h) Analyze the risks that the company is subject to if it decides for the adoption of the new 

technology. 

Assignment Question 5 

i) Summarize the analysis done and decide whether the adoption of the new technology is 

the right measure to take.  

j) Understand how the adoption of the new technology can create a source of competitive 

advantage and assess its sustainability.

5. Analysis 

a) Describe the overall performance of the company before 2008 and its strategic 

goals.  

In order to describe the overall performance of a company and its strategic goals, it is 

important to describe the company’s mission, vision and values. In the Retalis case, the 

company works based on the follow vision, mission and values: 

 

The vision of Retalis shows how the company wants to be seen by the society. It 

influences the employees’ performance and motivation to work with the company. The 

mission is seen as a long term guide that hardly changes and influences the company goals. 

The values are also the way that the company wants to be seen and demand its employees 

to work on that way. 

Having in mind the company vision, mission and values, the company formulates its own 

strategic goals: 

-To provide more radio services for the associates; 

-To provide stable and continue extra revenues for the associates besides the taxi 

service; 

-To develop the service quality of the company; 

-To create loyal individual and business clients; 

-To improve the image of the taxi drivers among the society; 

Finally, it is possible to analyze, based on the information supplied on the case, how the 

company was performing in the market before 2008. The internal analysis shows how the 

use of resources and management capabilities can have impact on the company results. For 

Vision 

• Be the Lisbon market 
leader and a 
reference for the Taxi 
cooperatives in other 
Portuguese cities ; 

Mission 

• Its mission consists in 
creating value for the 
associates and 
customers trough a 
transparent and clear 
backup support. To 
create new sources of 
revenues and reduce 
costs for the 
associates; 

Values 

• Focus on the 
associates and clients 

• Team work and 
cooperation 

• Responsability  

• Integrity and 
transparency 

• Accessibility  



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

35 
 

this internal analysis, the SWOT analysis could be used, combining the strengths and 

weaknesses of the company with the threats and opportunities of the market.  

Strengths 

1. Powerful brand name in the industry. When people think in taxi, automatically think in 

Radio Taxis; 

2. Market leader in the taxi industry; 

3. Ability to create extra revenues for the associates and consequently for the company; 

4. Agreement with BP to reduce the costs; 

5. Well-defined company structure; 

6. Simple cost structure; 

Weaknesses 

1. Advanced age and low education level of associates; 

2. Company revenues all related to the number of cars; 

3. Outdated technology systems; 

4. Dependency on associates to make decisions; 

5. Geographically limited business operations; 

6. Price policy defined by the local government; 

Opportunities 

1. Possibility of developing in the near future the business of adapting and selling the 

system to other cities; 

2. Local agreements with companies to create loyal clients; 

3. To make agreements with the municipal council for transportation policies; 

4. Development of marketing campaigns to attract new associates; 

5. Increase of Lisbon population; 

6. Increasing cost of parking in some Lisbon zones; 

Threats 

1. Increasing market share of Autocoope; 

2. Creation of small taxi associations; 

3. Increasing oil prices; 

4. Economic crisis that lead population to use cheaper means of transportation; 

5. Improvements made in Carris and Metro; 

6. Taxi drivers and firms are badly viewed in the society; 

 



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

36 
 

In order to achieve its strategic goals and mission, the company needs to change its 

operations. The company weaknesses have a bigger impact on the results than the 

strengths, and due to the threats of the market, some of the strengths can disappear in the 

near future if Retalis continues to opperate in the current way. In terms of identified 

opportunities, they can influenciate positively the business but it is not certain that they will 

generate revenues for Retalis. 

So as a conclusion, the overall performance of the company is not satisfactory, since 

there are a lot of features that are weakening and threatening the company operations and 

improvements to be made. 

b) Summarize the macro-environmental factors that have been influencing the 

company performance. 

In order to understand the key macro-environmental factors that are influencing the 

activity of Retalis, it is important to consider the PESTEL analysis, with the aim of identifying 

the main external factors that influence the company’s performance in the market and the 

demand behavior within the industry.  All the factors that are influencing the company activity 

as well as the demand behavior are graphically summarized in Table 1:

c) Analyze Retalis competition in the transportation industry.  

The first step needed to analyze the competition within an industry is to analyze its life-

cycle. The taxi industry was already a mature market, where the different companies battled 

to allocate more services to their associates, in order to keep them in the company and 

attract new ones. According to the information provided in the case there are three main 

companies in the taxi industry that are in different phases of their lives, due to different 

strategies of their managers. But this framework can only be used to analyze the industry, so 

in the Graph 1 it can be seen the position of the industry in the respective life-cycle. 

Graph 1 

 

After analyzing the industry life-cycle, it is important to understand the structural 

attractiveness of the industry. The most solid framework to analyze this attractiveness is the 

Porter Five Forces.   

In the Table 2 there is an evaluation of the taxi industry attractiveness through the 

application of the Porter Five Forces framework. 

 



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

38 
 

Table 2 

 Taxi Industry 

 

Threat of New Entry 

Low 

With the current legislation, where the municipal council 

controls the number of taxis in Lisbon there is no threat to 

potential entrants in the industry. There are already 3 big 

companies operating in the business and there is not a big 

opportunity to new entrants. So the threat is low. 

 

 

Bargaining Power of Buyers 

High 

The current economic crisis makes the consumer 

rationalize expenses and cut in the consumption of 

products and services that are not indispensable. Also 

there are a lot of competition in the industry and a lot of 

taxis to choose from. Finally the consumer has several 

choices in terms of means of transportation. So the 

bargaining power of buyers is very high. 

 

 

Bargaining Power of Suppliers 

 

 

Moderate/Low 

In terms of suppliers in the taxi industry they mostly 

consist in the gas stations and the drivers of the taxis that 

are the ones responsible to supply the service for Retalis 

customers. The gas stations have a big interest to have 

such a big client that consumes their product daily and the 

taxi drivers also have a big interest to provide the service 

in order to win more money. So the power of suppliers is 

moderate/low 

 

 

Threat of Substitutes 

 

 

High 

There are several means of transportation that a person 

can choose from to move from a place to another in 

Lisbon. From his/her personal car, to metro, bus, tram and 

train. There are a lot of options to choose from and with 

the current crisis consumers tend to choose from cheaper 

means of transportation. So the threat of substitutes is 

very high. 

 

Competition Rivalry 

 

High 

The very high threat of substitutes and the very high 

bargaining power of buyers aligned with the huge amount 

of taxis in Lisbon make the rivalry among competition to 

be very high.  

Through the five forces analysis it is possible to conclude that the taxi industry 

attractiveness is low, mostly because of the high existing rivalry, the diversity of existing 

subsititutes and also because it is already a mature market with a small potential to grow.  



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

39 
 

d) Compare Retalis primary activities with the other taxi cooperative companies in 

Lisbon. 

In order to characterize the company’s business activity, it is useful to use Porter´s Value 

Chain. With the aim of evaluating how the company’s activities are performing, the 

company’s typical business is going to be compared with the main competitor, namely 

Autocoope.  

Graph 2 

 

The primary activities performed by Retalis and Autocoope are very similar. Since they 

are companies that only provide services to their taxi drivers, they are very limited in terms of 

value chain. In terms of inbound logistics their inputs are particularly the same, their suppliers 

consist in telecommunication companies that only supply the equipment for the central and 

for the cars to receive the services over the radio. Each company works with a different 

operator but there are not huge differences among them.  

 In terms of operations the two main companies work similarly: they receive the client call 

and announce the information over the radio similarly in order for the associates to apply for 

the service. The allocation process for the services works in the same way for both 

companies. Also at the operational level, these companies are responsible to search for 

agreements with individual clients and companies to create some new sources of revenues 

and loyal clients for the associates. In this chapter each company have different agreements 

that differentiate from each other, and Retalis has more diverse and specialized contracts, 

like the BP agreement, the advertisement in the cars and the Radio Taxis social found.  

In what concerns the Outbound logistics, it consists in the communication with the client 

where the car number that is going to his/her address is specified and the predicted time that 

is going to take. This step works in the same way for both companies. 

Regarding marketing, the two companies have been working differently in the last years. 

On one hand, Retalis has been doing nothing in terms of marketing, trusting only in the word 

of mouth over the taxi drivers to attract new associates. On the other hand, Autocoope 

dropped the affiliation fee and was reaching for the taxi drivers that did not belong to any

cooperative association. This difference made Autocoope grew a lot and be very close to 

Retalis numbers. 

Finally the end-service consists in the transportation of a client from one place to another 

and it is performed by taxi drivers. Each service is different, there are services that are well 

performed but there are others that dissatisfied the customer. In the last case the main 

complains are the antipathy of the driver and the client’s feeling that the driver took a longer 

way than necessary in order to charge more money. If the client feels the need to complain, 

he/she goes to the police and the driver can be suspended by the cooperative for a certain 

period of time. These acts can damage the company image, because one bad act from an 

associate can be generalized to the entire company, making it loose customers. On the other 

hand both companies provide credit services to the customers. In table 3 the core differences 

between the two companies and its effects on margin are analyzed.  

Table 3 

 Core Differences Effect on Margin 

Inbound Logistics -There are not huge differences. The 

companies work with different 

telecommunication suppliers but the 

processes are very similar.  

- As they work similarly, there is 

not a big impact on the 

companies’ margins. 

Operations -Business processes to allocate 

services to the associates are the 

same. What differentiates the 

companies is the extra revenues 

processes and specific agreements. 

- With more diverse agreements 

and sources of revenues 

provided, Retalis is able to 

attract new associates and 

maintain the existing ones. Has 

a positive impact on the margin. 

Outbound Logistics -There are not big differences 

between companies 

-No Impact  

 

Marketing 

-Retalis has been doing almost 

nothing regarding marketing. On the 

other hand Autocoope dropped 

affiliation fee and was promoting 

among the taxi drivers that did not 

belong to any cooperative to attract 

them to the company. 

- The marketing by Autocoope 

attracted several associates to 

the company and some Retalis 

associates that were 

unsatisfied. Has a negative 

impact on Retalis margin. 

 

Service 

-A taxi service is similar for both 

companies and is performed by the 

different associates. 

- The credit service provided by both 

companies are also similar. 

-As there are a large number of 

associates, a bad act from one 

of them can create a 

generalization to the entire 

company. Affects the company 

margin negatively.

e) Highlight the main issues and problems that were concerning Jose Dionisio and his 

team.  

To understand the key issues and problems that were affecting the company it is 

important to analyze the threats that the company was facing at that time and also analyze 

the performance of the used technology systems through an S-curve analysis.  

Based on the case there were several threats that were affecting the company business, 

namely: 

Threats 

Increase of Autocoope market share 

Increase of oil prices 

Outdated technology system 

Associates leaving the company 

Unsatisfied demand 

Economic crisis 

 

Some of these threats were directly linked to the company core competences and it was 

necessary to do something to change it. On the other hand, the increase of oil prices, 

Autocoope growth and the economic crisis were factors outside the company that shou ld be 

taken into consideration in the adoption of a new strategy for Retalis.  

Also it is important to highlight that the internal problems facing the company were related  

with each other. So, by upgrading the technology system to a modern and effective one it 

would be possible to satisfy better the demand and consequently the associates would not 

leave the company. They would have more radio services,  and Retalis would differentiate 

from the main competitors.  

From the analysis of the S-curve (graph 3), it would be 

possible to conclude that the technology used had reached 

its maximum performance, that it was outdated and that the 

company should move to a new one in order to satisfy 

better the customers and stop the associates resigning.  

 

                                                                                                              Graph 3: S-curve

f) Analyze the reasons that lead the company to propose the adoption of the new 

technology. 

There are several drivers that can influence the adoption of a new technology by a certain 

company, namely: the appearance of new competitors, an external crisis, the appearance of 

a new technology, changes in the market and in the industry competitiveness. 

In the case of Retalis it was a combination of these main drivers that made the company 

president Eng. Jose Dionisio think of the possible adoption of a new system that would 

replace the one that had been used in the last 30 years. In table 4 it can be seen how the 

main drivers influence the company on the adoption of the new technology.  

Table 4 

Drivers Influence 

New Competitors Low 

External Crisis Moderate 

New technology Performance High 

Changes in the Market Moderate 

Industry Competitiveness High 

 

In the last years there were no new taxi entrances in the market and the public 

transportation offered by the government was already well covered. There were several 

barriers imposed by the government to the entrance of new taxis in Lisbon (the 3550 taxis 

were more than enough for the demand required), consequently the possible entrance of 

new competitors were not a big threat that was concerning Jose Dionisio. So the influence, of 

possible entry in the industry, was low for the adoption of the new technology.  

An economic crisis is always seen as an event that interrupts a period of stability and 

requires the adoption of practices different from the ones being performed. In 2008 there was 

a serious economic crisis in Europe and Portugal was not an exception. Several companies 

were closing and unemployment was really high. With the economic crisis, people spend less 

money where they can and the impact in Retalis could be high, because the taxi 

transportation is not an indispensable good. With the current technology there was 

unsatisfied demand that was switching to the competitors or to other means of transportation. 

The company could not take the risk to lose more clients. A change in the way that the 

company operated was necessary. So the influence of the economic crisis was moderate.  



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

43 
 

The Radio System in Retalis was supported by a completely obsolete more than 30 years 

old technology. It took a very long time from the call made by the client for the car to arrive in 

the required address. And the process of allocating the service was susceptible to several 

flaws, untruths and mistakes. There was a historical of lies made by the taxi drivers saying 

that they were in a certain place and they were not, just to receive the service. Also the 

register of the address could be done wrongly and consequently the service would not be 

delivered. With the GSM/GPRS system all this threats would be reduced, because the 

system would allow to deliver a service in 20 seconds, the localization of the nearest car 

would be automatic and the address of a client would be already on the list. The new 

technology performance could beneficiate a lot the company’s activity so the influence in the 

decision was high.  

The market change topic is related to the economic crisis and the new technology 

performance because it is a consequence of them. The market is always changing and 

currently with new technologies and the economic crisis the clients are getting more 

demanding in terms of quality. They require a good service in order to see their money spent 

in a service that they liked. So the influence of the market change was moderate. 

Finally the industry competitiveness had a high influence in the management proposal of 

a new technology. Autocoope had been growing a lot in the last years and it was threatening 

the leadership of Retalis in the taxi industry. Also the Portuguese government had made 

some improvements in the collective public transportation (Carris and Metro), like the quality 

improvement of buses and metros or the covering of more Lisbon surrounding areas. Thus, 

public transportation was stealing clients on comfort, functionality and quickness ground.  

So the different drivers had an influence in the new technology adoption proposal, but 

some of them had a bigger impact than others, due to the external environment that was 

influencing the company business. 

g) Compare the value that would be added by the adoption of the new technology with 

the value that is currently added. 

In order to analyze the impact of the new technology adoption in Retalis, it is important to 

compare its value added with the value that was previously added by the used technology. 

The adoption of the GRSM/GSM system would have an impact on both primary and support 

Retalis activity. In terms of primary activities the impact will mostly be seen in operations and 

in service. Regarding the support activities the main impact would be seen in the technology 

development and human resources management. As the old system was already discussed 



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

44 
 

and analyzed in question d), it is important to analyze how the GSM/GPRS system would 

create value for the associates and end-users of the service.  

The GSM/GPRS would have a huge impact in Retalis operations. It would enable the 

company to allocate more than one service at a time in a better, more efficient and effective 

way. Instead of receiving the clients address and communicate it over the radio for the 

associates to apply in a long confuse and sometimes problematic way, the system 

automatically identifies the nearest car. The driver has up to twenty seconds to apply for the 

service. If he does not press any button, the service passes on to the second nearest car and 

so on. The system adoption would create value for Retalis, its associates and clients in 

different ways but all of them inter-related. That was the main goal of Jose Dionisio, in a way 

that the technology adoption was not an end by itself, only a mean to an end and that end 

was to please the people that were involved with Retalis. In table 5 the value added to the 

different players involved with the company can be seen. 

Table 5 

 Value Added 

 

Clients 

-Spending less time over the phone waiting to talk to an operator; 

-Reduction on the time and money spent waiting to know which 

car was allocated to him/her; 

-As the service is quicker there is no need to go to the streets 

looking for a taxi; 

 

 

Associates 

-More than one service at a time means that there will be more 

services available over the radio; 

-More radio services allow associates to increase revenues and 

reduce costs (there is a lower need to drive along the city looking 

for clients, which means that there would be a lower oil 

consumption and a lower threat to accidents); 

-The automatic allocation of services deletes the historical of lies 

and makes the allocation fairer; 

-Clients would prefer Retalis due to its effectiveness and efficient 

service which would also increase the demand for the associates; 

 

 

Retalis 

-Opportunity to create a differentiation and consequently a source 

of competitive advantage; 

-The quicker allocation of service makes the clients happy and 

might turn them loyal to Retalis; 

-More services over the radio makes the associates happier and 

consequently they will not fell the need to drop Retalis; 

-By creating a more efficient and effective service, end-users 

would prefer Retalis and this might attract new associates to the 

company.

45 
 

 

The new technology adoption implies a change on the company’s strategy. Since its 

foundation, Retalis was mainly focused on the creation of extra revenues or agreements that 

benefit directly the associate. It was not an inappropriate strategy, in a way that the 

associates are the ones that bring revenues for Retalis. Although in the last years, this 

strategy was not enough because it did not bring any benefit for the end-consumer of the 

service provided by Retalis. With the adoption of the GSM/GPRS system there was a change 

in the company’s strategy. It was not only adding value for the associate but also for the end-

consumer of the service. 

h) Analyze the risks that the company is subject to if it decides for the adoption of the 

new technology. 

In the adoption of a new technology there is always the uncertainty element, where 

innovation does not create the expected final benefit or even create social and economical 

losses for the customer. There are five main types of interrelated risks that contribute to 

customer resistance in the adoption of a new technology: financial, performance, physical, 

social and psychological risk. These different risks together contribute to the risk of adoption 

of alternative services that affect directly the company business.  

In the Retalis case the adoption of the GSM/GPRS system is subjected to some of these 

risks in a different way as it can be seen in table 6. 

Table 6 

Type of risk Risk Level 

Financial Risk High 

Performance Risk High 

Physical Risk Low 

Social Risk Low 

Psychological Risk Moderate/High 

Adoption of Alternative Services Risk Moderate/High 

 

In the adoption of the new system each Retalis associate needs to spend 1400 Euros to 

buy and install the equipment in his taxi. In times of crisis it is an high investment, especially 

for those that have more than one taxi working in the firm. First there is the risk that some  of 

them decide to leave the company because they do not find it worth to spend that amount in 



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

46 
 

the new system. Also there is the risk that, after the adoption of the new system, the 

associates demand a shot payback period for their investment. But it is known that, after the 

adoption of a new technology, there is a learning process before it works at the maximum 

performance. So if the associates become unsatisfied with the new technology, they would 

start to leave the company, making the level of financial risk high.  

In what the performance risk is concerned, it is related to the financial risk. The 

GPRS/GSM looks better than the currently used system but if the expectations of the 

associates are at high level, they will demand results since the beginning of implementation. 

And that would not be possible because there is the introduction phase where they need to 

learn out to work with it, before the maximum performance of the system is reached. These 

high expectations can make some associates unsatisfied with the system and start to leave 

the company. So there is a high performance risk.  

In what the physical and social risks are concerned, they are low to Retalis. The new 

system is perfectly safe and for those that purchase the system it only means a different way 

to operate in order to get the services over the radio system. And if the system is adopted, 

society might even look at taxi drivers differently, because the system will show some 

expertise.  

Finally the psychological risk represents a moderate/high threat for Retalis. Most of the 

company associates have more than thirty years of affiliation, a low education level and an 

advanced age. They look at this new technology system with distrust, do not identify 

themselves with the system and do not see it as a solution for the company’s problems. By 

adopting the system some of them can leave the company because they do not find the 

system worth it.  

i) Summarize the analysis done and decide whether the adoption of the new 

technology is the right measure to take.  

In the previous class topics both the internal and the external environmental situation were 

analyzed, through several frameworks and Retalis proposal to adopt the GSM/GPRS system 

was discussed.  

Regarding the internal analysis, Retalis is the biggest cooperative enterprise and is 

characterized for having a radio service that has the ultimate goal to add value to its 

associates, by providing more services to them with no need to drive along the city searching 

for clients and to create new sources of revenues. Retalis had also the goal to satisfy the end 

consumer, through a practical, quick and effective service. But the company’s performance 

was not going well, it had been losing associates and clients were unsatisfied because the 

radio service was not effective and was completely outdated. There was also an historical of 



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

47 
 

lies between the associates when they were applying for a service that was causing troubles 

and worrying Retalis.  

In the external analysis it can be highlighted that the Lisbon taxi industry is a very 

competitive market and it has a big control from the municipal council in terms of prices and 

limited geographical area of operation. There were 3500 cars (including Retalis, Autocoope, 

Teletaxis and individual owners) and the demand for them is not very high. Moreover, Retalis 

main competitor in the taxi industry, Autocoope, had been increasing its market share, due to 

a reformulation in the company and an effective marketing campaign to attract new 

associates, which was threatening Retalis leadership. Also, due to the economic crisis and 

improvements made in means of transportation like Carris and Metro, potential customers 

prefer to use cheaper means of transportation that allow them to save money. Finally, the 

increase in oil prices was affecting the entire industry, because it was an indispensable input 

and consequently the costs of the activity were increasing drastically.  

All internal problems aligned with external threats made Retalis management propose the 

adoption of the GSM/GPRS system. It was a modern and effective system that would allow 

the company to distribute more than one service at a time and eliminate the historical of lies 

that was creating problems. The system would automatically identify the nearest car, so 

there was no need to discuss it. Also in the clients perspective the system would allow to 

save time and costs, because the time spent on the phone asking for a service would 

decrease from an average 5 minutes to 20 seconds.  

The S-Curve provides a useful framework to compare 

the performance of the currently used system and the 

GSM/GPRS system. In the graph 4 can be seen how the 

new technology evolves in terms of performance when 

compared with the previously system. In the beginning 

there is all the learning process which can be difficult. 

After that the knowledge is acquired and the 

performance can grow a lot, creating a source of 

competitive advantage for Retalis.                                               Graph 4: S-curves 

Despite the performance benefits in terms of allocation of services, Retalis should be 

aware of the threats that the adoption of this system would create. For that it is important to 

compare the main opportunities and threats that the company would have if it decides to 

adopt the GSM/GPRS system: 

 

 



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

48 
 

Opportunities: 

- More effective system might attract new associates for the company and keep current 

members. 

- Creation a better image of Retalis and its drivers in the market. 

- Increasingly satisfied clients for the same price can create a source of competitive 

advantage. 

- By being the first one to implement the system, Retalis can then outsource to other 

cities. 

Threats: 

- High investment needed to implement the service aligned with the economic crisis can 

make some associates leave the company. 

- Traditional working culture can be an obstacle for the new system implementation. 

- Advanced age and low education level of associates makes them look to new 

technologies with distrust and they might also leave the company. 

- Competitors can easily have access to a similar system in the market and copy it. 

 

This should be the basis of the class discussion for the adoption or not adoption of the 

GSM/GPRS system. Even though some opinions may differ, Retalis should adopt the new 

system not only because it improves the company’s performance but also because it creates 

a source of competitive advantage. Also if Retalis does not move ahead, other competitor 

might adopt the system and create its own competitive advantage and gain the related 

benefits. Even if some associates leave the company and consequently the company’s 

revenues go down, in the future and after the learning process, Retalis will rise again in 

terms of associates and become the most attractive company in the industry to work with for 

several years.  

Regarding the recommendations for the company, it should always try to update it 

systems in order not to repeat the past mistakes and should also do two different marketing 

campaigns: one to attract new associates by showing the advantages of the GSM/GPRS 

system and another to the end-consumer to show the quickness and advantages of using 

Retalis taxis instead of the competitors and substitutes. Finally, after the GSM/GPRS is 

completely operational and working closer to the maximum performance, Retalis should try 

to outsource it to other Portuguese cities. This would not only be beneficial for Retalis in the 

creation of a new source of revenue but also to the other cities companies, because although 



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

49 
 

similar systems are easily accessible in the market, Retalis knowledge of the system would 

accelerate the learning process and the results  would appear faster. 

j) Understand how the adoption of the new technology can create a source of 

competitive advantage and assess its sustainability. 

There are three main types of strategies that can lead to a company’s competitive 

advantage: cost, differentiation and focus strategy. With the adoption of the GSM/GPRS 

system Retalis is investing in a new technology that will differentiate and improve the quality 

and create value for the service provided, when compared to the competition.  

By being the first taxi cooperative to adopt and update the technology systems, Retalis 

would create an impact in the market that would create a recognition and attract to the 

company more associates and clients. Because the associates would get more services over 

the radio and consequently their revenues would increase and costs would decrease. 

Regarding the clients they would have a faster service with lower flaws for the same price. 

So, being the first company to adopt the new technology would create value to the company, 

its associates and clients, creating a source of competitive advantage. 

However, it is necessary to analyse if the competitive advantage would be sustainable in 

the future. So it is important to analyze the rarity, immitability and subsitutability of the service 

provided by the new technology use: 

-Rarity: Retalis would be the first company to update the technology systems to a more 

efficient and effective one, which would create an impact on the way that the market would 

look to the company. Also they would acquire knowledge in the operations management that 

the other companies do not have.  But it is important to notice that technology is always 

evolving, and if Retalis wants to keep leading the industry, it is necessary to currently update 

the systems in order to better satisfy the demand. 

-Inimitability: The GSM/GPRS system is available for the other companies in the market; 

since it was not a product developed by Retalis but from a company specialized in this type 

of communications. Retalis competitors can, easily, get access to a similar system in the 

market if they have the necessary budget to invest. But the competitors did not have the 

same number of associates of Retalis, and it was going to be harder for them to collect the 

necessary investment. Also there is a transition period from a system to another, and when 

the competitors are updating its systems (if they decide to), Retalis would already be working 

with it and creating an impact on the market that would be harder to imitate.  

-Substitutability: it is an issue that will continue to threat Retalis. The GSM/GPRS 

system might improve the service quality and create a competitive advantage when 

compared to the other taxi cooperatives. But on the other hand the current Portuguese 



Retalis, Cooperative Radio Taxis Lisboa: The decline in the taxi industry 

50 
 

economic crisis is leading customers to use cheaper means of transportation, which is 

threatening and stealing customers from the taxi industry. So regarding the substitutability, 

Retalis service will continue to be threatened by other means of transportation and, in spite 

of the better service provided, there are a lot of players in the taxi industry that might replace 

Retalis service. 

So as a conclusion, the new technology adoption can create a competitive advantage for 

Retalis via the service differentiation and it might be sustainable in the next two years if it is 

well released in the market. But in order to keep the leading position in the industry, Retalis 

should be continuously updating the technology system in the future in order not to repeat 

the mistakes of the past (keeping the same system for thirty years) and lose their competitive 

advantage. 

Finally, as it was already recommended in the Class Plan question i), it is important to 

highlight that although similar systems with similar functionalities could easily be accessible 

in the market, Retalis should try to outsource the system to other cities. And this action would 

be advantageous both for Retalis and other cities companies. On one hand Retalis would be 

creating a new source of revenue and consequently increasing its profits, on the other hand 

the other cities companies would see results of the adoption faster, because Retalis 

knowledge would be transmitted to them which would accelerate the learning process.

7. Conclusion 

Retalis was created with the ultimate goal of helping, through a radio service, its 

associates in the search of clients with no need to drive along the city looking for them. At the 

same time the client would also beneficiate from the service because it would be easier and 

faster to get a taxi. As the years went by, the company became the leader in the industry and 

the technology system used to allocate the services had remained the same for the last thirty 

years which originated a deeply rooted working culture among the associates. For several 

years Retalis did not have a strong competition, but after the shift of Autocoope strategy, the 

scenario had changed and in the beginning of 2008 the market share of the two companies 

was not that different due to an effective campaign made by Autocoope to attract new 

associates.  

With technology evolution, consumers demand better quality in the products and services 

that they use. The Retalis radio system was the same since the foundation. It had several 

flaws and was completely outdated, in a way that it was only possible to allocate one service 

at a time and it took on average five minutes in the allocation. This originated unsatisfied 

demand due to the time spent on the phone waiting to know which car was coming to get 

his/her address and unsatisfied associates that started to resign from Retalis because the 

amount of radio services performed by car were a very small percentage of the total 

services.  

The company’s decision to propose the adoption of the GSM/GPRS system was then 

caused by the problems related with the dissatisfaction of both associates and customers. 

This system also represented a change in the company’s strategy, because it was not only 

taking measures to beneficiate the associate but also adding value to the clients. Despite the 

notorious performance improvement brought by the new system there were several risks that 

the company would face, mostly financial, physiological (characteristics of associates with 

advanced age and low education) and also regarding the performance expectations. The 

characteristics of the associates, mostly the advanced age and low education level were a 

barrier for the new system adoption. In fact, they could leave the company if they disagree 

with they did not agree with the measure and with that weakness even more Retalis 

leadership.  

However, something must change in the company and the technology improvement was 

extremely necessary for the future performance. By being the first one to adopt the new 

system, Retalis would create a source of competitive advantage that could bring advantages 

and results in the medium future and it could also make possible to expand the business to 

other Portuguese cities, via outsourcing.

So it can be concluded that Retalis should adopt the GSM/GPRS system in order to 

improve its position in the market and also gain a competitive advantage over its competitors. 

But it would only be possible, if the associates cooperate with each other and a ligned the 

measure with an effective marketing campaign to attract new associates and increase 

awareness in the market. Also in the future, the company should try to outsource the system 

to other cities in order to get a new source of revenue. 

8. What happened 

The situation discussed and analyzed during the dissertation took place in 2008. So it may 

be useful for the instructor to have information on what was the Retalis decision and its main 

consequences and decide whether to share it with students.  

Retalis decided to adopt the GSM/GPRS system in December of 2008. But it was not an 

unanimous decision, in a way that some associates were against it, claiming that the new 

system adoption was very expensive and that it was only a way to get money from the 

associates with no practical results. In fact, a “rebellion” newspaper against the president 

Eng. Jose Dionisio was created, which showed the intensity of the opposition. By the end of 

the year, 130 associates left the company, arguing that the new system adoption was a bad 

decision. This represented a setback for the company, because one of its goals was to 

increase market share, and with the resigning of these members, it was losing even more 

share. 

The launch of the system took place in June 2009, after some months of studies, 

preparation of the entire fleet and training for the taxi drivers. The results were not immediate 

and some of the associates started to complain about it. During this period there were 

several meetings where it was explained that the results could only be seen in the 

medium/long term. 

Finally, after some months of working with the GSM/GRPS system, it was possible to see 

some results: the percentage of the new system services over the total services increased (6 

out of 20 services); and the diesel costs did not decrease due to the increase of the oil 

prices, but the consumption did reduce. 

In the company’s perspective, the results were good but not as good as expected. In its 

perspective, the service provided was better than the competition and better than the 

previous one, so they increased the entrance fee from 1000 Euros to 5000 Euros, which 

meant that some of those who were interested to enter into the company gave up, because 

they could not afford it. Also the company did not make an effort on the marketing campaign

to the clients, and currently the major part of the population does not know about the Retalis 

change and improvement. 

When the new president Pedro Lopes joined Retalis, the entrance fee was reduced to the 

1000 Euros and with that measure, the company was able to attract new associates and 

reached 700 cars in the end of 2011.  

In 2011 Retalis also launched the Ebooking system where individual and business clients 

that use frequently Retalis service could create a personal account and have in their 

computers a program that would allow them, with just one click, call for a taxi with no need to 

use the phone. Finally in 2012 Retalis is planning to introduce the Internet service, where 

every client, and not the ones that frequently use the company’s services, can go Retalis 

website and ask for a taxi or book it to a certain hour. 

The competition felt the need to improve its information systems too, and Autocoope is 

currently planning to adopt a system similar to the one being used by Retalis.

V. Conclusion 

During these six months of working in this dissertation there were several aspects that 

contributed to the acquisition of knowledge. It was very interesting to understand how a taxi 

company like Retalis works and all the processes that are behind a taxi service. Most people 

that call for a taxi and after a couple of minutes have a car at their door, do not have the 

slightest idea about all the backup processes that made it possible. Also, in this time of crisis 

it was exciting to understand what Retalis has been doing to fight against it, aware that the 

taxi service is more expensive than other means of transportation. Instead of cutting costs or 

other savings, the company invested in the quality of service to attract new associates and 

create loyal clients. Although this could be nonsense, something had to be done to fight 

against the decline of the company in the industry. 

One of the main challenges during the dissertation was the search for information 

regarding the company and the industry. There is not that much information available in the 

Internet and in addition the information provided by the company was contradictory in what 

some numbers were concerned, especially information from the past and from the 

competition. But at the same time it was very demanding and interesting to analyze the 

contradictions and find the most reliable information.  

Finally it was interesting to apply frameworks and concepts learned during strategy 

classes to an industry where they had never been applied or, at least, where there is no 

literature about it. 

Regarding the challenges for the company, it is important to highlight that the adoption of 

the GSM/GPRS system was important for the company but it did not solve all the problems. 

Other challenges continued to exist. The economic crisis and the continued increase of oil 

prices are two problems that kept to affect the industry and that make it less profitable and 

attractive. The total services per day are decreasing and the costs of the activity are higher 

than ever, decreasing the profits of the different taxis and consequently the profits of Retalis 

and other similar companies.  

If I had more time, it would have been interesting to analyze how the industry can bypass 

these problems. It could be important for the industry to develop a marketing campaign, 

showing that taxi transportation, does not have to be expensive, if people adopt the taxi 

together, which means, sharing the taxi with friends or neighbors to go to work for example. 

Also, in the company’s perspective it could be attractive to expand or outsource the new 

system to other cities, in order to increase brand awareness and revenues.

Finally, in a further development of my work it would be interesting to compare the activity 

of taxis that have a radio system and others that do not, in terms of services and kilometers 

per day. Also, the comparison of the activity of different cities could be explored, in order to 

have a general overview of what is happening nationally.  

As a general conclusion, it was very interesting to write this dissertation, where I learned 

and understood how the taxi industry works and applied the concepts and frameworks 

acquired in class to the analysis of the industry and the decision of adopting the GSM/GPRS 

system by Retalis.
