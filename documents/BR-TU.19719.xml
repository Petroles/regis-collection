resumo 

 

 

Os recursos do mar profundo têm sido cada vez mais 
explorados, e devido a isso, vários ecossistemas e 
espécies têm sido gravemente afectados. As populações 
de tubarões de profundidade são das mais perturbadas, 
especialmente pelas práticas de pesca não seletivas, 
capturas acessórias e descarte, principalmente devido ao 
seu baixo valor comercial. Estas práticas tornam os 
tubarões de profundidade muito vulneráveis à sobre-
pesca dadas as suas características de história de vida, 
aumentando assim o seu risco de extinção . 
Com a proibição da pesca direta, e a implementação de 
quotas e TACs (Capturas Totais Admissíveis) na pesca 
de tubarões de profundidade, as capturas oficiais têm 
vindo a decrescer. No entanto, as capturas não 
reportadas têm vindo a aumentar exponencialmente.  
Com a análise da captura por unidade de esforço 
(CPUE), da profundidade, e do peso médio dos 
indivíduos ao longo dos anos de cada umas das 9 
espécies de tubarões mais pescadas nos Açores, 
conseguimos fazer uma análise descritiva do efeito das 
pescas nestas espécies. 
Os resultados mostram que algumas destas espécies 
têm vindo a sofrer uma grande pressão por parte da 
pesca, e que as suas populações serão gravemente 
afetadas num futuro próximo se não forem tomadas 
medidas drásticas no que toca à gestão da sua 
sustentabilidade a longo prazo.

 abstract 

 

Deep-sea resources have been increasingly exploited, 
and due to that, several ecosystems and species have 
been considerably affected. Deep-water sharks 
populations have been of the most disturbed by practices 
of unselected fisheries, bycatch and discard, mainly due 
to their low commercial value. Those practices make 
deep-water sharks very vulnerable to overfishing given 
their life-history traits, increasing their extinction risk.  
With the prohibition of the direct fishery, and 
implementation of quotas and TACs (Total Allowable 
Catches) regarding the deep-sea shark landings, the 
official landings have dramatically decreased after the 
1990s. However, the IUU (Illegal, unreported and 
unregulated) catch has exponentially increased.  
With the analysis of catch per unit effort (CPUE), the 
depths, and the mean weight of the individuals over the 
years for each one of the nine most caught species in the 
Azores, we produced a descriptive analysis of the effect 
of fisheries in those species. 
The results show that some of these species have been 
suffering from a great fishing pressure, and their 
populations will be greatly affected in the near future if 
drastic measures are not taken when it comes to 
managing their long term sustainability.

1. INTRODUCTION 

  

 Fishing is the economic activity with the greatest impacts on the marine 

environment, and due to that, the effects of fishing have generated great concern 

among scientists, the civil society in general, and the fishing industry. In result of 

the substantial world population growth, there is a higher demand for food, 

including fish protein (Turner, Thrush et al. 1999; Agardy 2000), and the Food and 

Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) reported that, just to 

accommodate human needs, worldwide fisheries production in marine waters was 

of 79.7 million tonnes in 2012 (FAO, 2014). These fisheries affect not only the 

target species and resources, but also other marine species because of poor 

selectivity, and lead to practices such as bycatch and discard, which also disturb 

the surrounding environment and ecological processes at very large scales 

(Garcia, Zerbi et al. 2003). Bycatch of non-target species and their discard is today 

seen as a serious problem in all world's oceans. 

 

1.1. Bycatch and discards 

 

 Bycatch can be defined as incidental catch of non target species, or target 

species with undesirable sizes or age, without any direct effort towards those 

species, while the discard is the portion of the catch that is not retained on board. 

Discard occurs mainly because of the lack of commercial value of bycatch and, 

depending on each fisherman and on the location of the fisheries, undesirable 

catches can be returned to the sea or thrown away (Gilman, Passfield et al. 2012). 

Even though they are related, these two concepts have different ecologic and 

economic impacts: bycatch affects several species but can be turned into profit 

and discarded species are a waste of valuable resources but can be useful to 

scavengers and seabirds (COFREPECHE and SCAPECHE, 2014; Sanchez, 

Demestre et al. 2004; Morandeau, Macher et al. 2014; Borges, Erzini et al. 2001). 



 12 

The impacts of these practices not only affect directly the populations of captured 

species, but also indirectly disturb the structure and function of the ecosystems in 

which they thrive (Borges, Erzini et al. 2001; Monteiro, Araujo et al. 2001; 

Jennings and Kaiser, 2000). Indirect effects on trophic interactions, through the 

depletion of the top predators for example, can affect the entire community 

function (Stevens, Bonfil et al. 2000; Hall, Alverson et al. 2000). Discarding 

practices can also benefit the population of scavenging species and disrupt 

ecosystem processes (Garthe and Scherp, 2003). The populations of scavenging 

birds in the North Sea, for instance, have been growing exponentially due to the 

vast access to the fisheries waste, that can be a very important part of their diet, 

since they consume about 50% of the material that is returned to the sea 

(Catchpole, Frid et al. 2006). The proportion of consumed discard can vary, mainly 

due to factors such as discard types, season of the year, area and the scavenging 

species (Allain, Biseau et al. 2013; Clark, Althaus et al. 2015). Depending on the 

species and their life-stage, the fisheries waste can be essential for their survival 

and if the discard rates decreases in the future, some species can be seriously 

affected and suffer high mortality (Garthe, Camphuysen et al. 1996). Benthic 

fishes and invertebrates can also take advantage from discards arriving to the sea, 

making a considerable contribution to the species energy demand and allowing 

the existence of bigger populations (Catchpole, Frid et al. 2006).  

 In 1994 the annual landings reported to FAO were approximately 83 million 

tonnes (Alverson et al. 1994), and the amount discard by commercial fisheries was 

close to one third of this value (Moranta, Massuti et al. 2000). However, in the 

following decade (1994 to 2004) a decline on the discard rates in the main 

fisheries around the world was reported (Sanchez, Demestre et al. 2004). Since 

1994, the global fish production has been growing steadily reaching about 91 

million tonnes in 2012 (FAO, 2014). When comparing regions and fishing gears, 

Hall et al. (2000) estimated that the highest discard rates were found in the 

northwest Pacific Ocean, and the shrimp trawl fisheries were the gear that more 

contributed to those rates, in terms of weight, with about 9 million tonnes, when 

comparing with the global total fish discard provided by Alverson et al. (1994). 



 13 

 To ensure long-term sustainable environmental conditions, the Common 

Fisheries Policy (CFP) recently created a conservation proposal to minimize the 

negative impact of fishing activities in the European Union marine ecosystems, 

decrease the unwanted catches and therefore to end the practice of discard, 

through the monitoring of the fleets data and the implementation of a discard ban 

in combination with catch quotas (European Commission, 2011). 

 Although the impacts of bycatch and discards have been well studied for 

shallow coastal water ecosystems, much less information is available for deeper 

waters (Kelleher, 2005).  

 

 1.2. Deep-sea fisheries 

 

 Deep-water fisheries usually take place between 200 – 2000 m, on oceanic 

seamounts, continental slopes and oceanic ridge systems (FAO, 2009). Those 

fisheries started after Second World War, driven by major technological 

improvements and by the need to seek for new and unexploited resources that 

were previously out of range of traditional fishing methods (Koslow, Boehlert et al. 

2000). Watson and Morato (2013) estimated that since 1950, the mean depth of 

fishing worldwide has increased by 350 m (Figure 1).  

 Among all human-related activities known to impact the deep sea, resource 

exploitation is the most preoccupying and can have serious future consequences 

such as significant environmental impacts on fragile habitats such as deep-sea 

coral beds and seamounts (Ramirez-Llodra, Tyler et al. 2011). It is only recently 

that scientists have raised concerns on the sustainability of deep-sea fishing 

suggesting dramatic consequences for deep-sea ecosystems (Benn, Weaver et al. 

2010). Fishing impacts on the deep sea can affect many habitats and species on 

several levels, being bottom trawling, because of its habitat-destructive 

characteristics, one of the major threats (Pham, Diogo et al. 2014). Low selectivity, 

drifting and lost fishing gear can also greatly affect the whole ecosystem, as they 

can continuously catch and trap fishes, marine mammals, invertebrates or 

seabirds for a long period of time (Davies, Roberts et al. 2007).

(solid line), fitted using a simple linear regression model and taking account both within 

and between species changes in mean depth. The dashed line shows the trend line from 

Morato et al. (2006a), accounting only for between-species effects. (Source: Watson and 

Morato, 2013) 

 

 

 Although the concern for conservation and management is increasing, the 

knowledge on the deep-sea as an ecosystem is still in its infancy, and it is possible 

that drastic changes happen in the future but remains undetected due to the 

difficulty in assessing the full range of anthropogenic impacts in this vast and 

understudied ecosystem (Benn, Weaver et al. 2010). 

 The deep-water fishing industry has been described as economically 

unsustainable and deep-sea fish a non-renewable resource (Glover and Smith, 

2003). It is expected that by 2025 all the existing deep-sea fisheries will be gravely 

affected, and by then new ones have been discovered, but they will not prevail 

more than 20 to 30 years (Glover and Smith, 2003). On top of the increasing 

fishing pressure, the deep sea is mainly exposed to unregulated fisheries (Clarke, 

Borges et al. 2005).  

   



 15 

1.3. Bycatch and discard in deep-sea fisheries 

 

 Deep-sea fishing activities can destroy the seafloor, reducing the 

complexity of several habitats, destroying species refuges and disturbing 

population of deep-sea corals and sponges (Benn, Weaver et al. 2010; 

COFREPECHE and SCAPECHE, 2014), but it can also increase the bycatch and 

discard rates not only of deep-sea species, but also fishes and invertebrates from 

more superficial layers, and even sea birds (Norse, Brooke et al. 2012; Durán 

Muñoz, Murillo et al. 2010).  

 Bottom trawling has been known to be one of the most destroying types of 

fishing gears, being responsible for several fish stocks collapses in the world 

(Davies, Roberts et al. 2007; Clark, Althaus et al. 2015). Even though passive 

gears (e.g. longlines) have negative impacts on deep-sea coral reefs, these are 

much lower when compared with bottom trawling (Pham, Diogo et al. 2014). For 

example, in the Alaskan waters, between 1990-2002, fishermen have landed near 

4182 tonnes of corals and sponges, and in the Orange roughy trawl fisheries, on 

the South Tasman Rise seamounts, corals represented approximately 25% of the 

fisheries bycatch (Norse, Brooke et al. 2012; Lewison, Crowder et al. 2004). For 

decades this problem has been neglected not only because of the ignorance of the 

existence of this issue but also because along all of the existing management 

priorities, the deep sea was not included.  

 Along with those practices, Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) 

catches have also been declared to be a serious problem, as a result of a lack of 

effective flag State control. These IUU values are the portion of the catch that is 

not accounted for official statistics, contributing to the overexploitation and 

depletion of fish stocks while destroys marine habitats (Pham et al. 2013). It has 

been reported that IUU captures can range between 11 and 26 million tonnes 

annually (FAO, 2009; Agnew, Pearce et al. 2009).

1.4 Deep-sea sharks 

 

According to Compagno (1999), more than 60% of the described species of 

sharks are found in the deep sea, and almost 53% of them occur at depths greater 

than 600 m. However, research on bycatch and discards of deep-sea sharks has 

received little attention. Depending on the species, their size, the season of the 

year and their economic value, they can be either commercialized or discarded 

(Haedrich, Merrett et al. 2001; Coelho, Bentes et al. 2003). Many of the sharks are 

landed already dead or with serious injuries due to the fishing equipment or the 

changes of the temperature and pressure. The ones who are still alive can be 

returned to the sea, even though the injuries will affect their survival (Allain, Biseau 

et al. 2003; Coelho and Erzini, 2008). Other species, with high commercial value 

are commercialized especially for their livers that contain squalene and other 

elements with high value to the pharmaceutical market (Blackwell and Stevenson, 

2003; Akhilesh, Ganga et al. 2011; Wetherbee, 2000).  

 Between 1940-1970 direct shark fisheries increased significantly due to the 

demand of the Vitamin A in their livers, but in the last years, a decreasing trend of 



 17 

the bycatch of deep-sea sharks has been noticed, along with the discard rates 

(Kyne and Simpfendorfer, 2007).  With the increasing concern about the impact of 

fishing on shark populations, organizations such as the International Union for 

Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and FAO, have created groups towards the 

conservation and management of sharks (Stevens, Bonfil et al. 2000; Oliver, 

Braccini et al. 2015).  

 Using bathymetric categories, deep-sea sharks can be categorized into four 

divisions: Paraprofundic (&amp;lt;200 m), Mesoprofundic (200 - 600 m), Holoprofundic (? 

600 m) and Metaprofundic (greater than 600 m) (Martin and Treberg, 2002). For 

the purposes of this project, we will consider deep-sea sharks as those whose 

distribution is bellow 200 m and those with a life cycle characterized by high 

longevity (&gt; 25 years), low growth rates, low fecundity, long gestation period and 

late maturity (Kyne and Simpfendorfer, 2007; Moura, Jones et al. 2014). Their life-

history traits make these species highly vulnerable to overexploitation because 

they cannot overcome high mortality rates: once the population starts to decline, 

recovery will take decades or centuries (Ramos, Silva et al. 2013; ICES, 2013; 

García, Lucifora et al. 2008; Ferretti, Worm et al. 2010). Deep-sea chondrichtyans 

are considered 1.6 - 1.9 times more vulnerable to extinction than continental shelf 

chondrichtyans, and 2.4 - 2.9 times more than oceanic ones (García, Lucifora et 

al. 2008). 

 It has been shown by several authors that even the slightest mortality rates 

can quickly lead species with these life-history traits to overexploitation when 

exposed to multi-species fisheries (Barker and Schluessel, 2005;  Clarke, Borges 

et al. 2005; Akhilesh, Ganga et al. 2011; Coelho and Erzini, 2008; Ferretti, Worm 

et al. 2010; García, Lucifora et al. 2008; Walker, 1998) or fisheries targeting shark 

resources world-wide (Walker, 1998). In collaboration with FAO, Castro (1999) 

determined that between 1989 and 1999, at least 26 shark species have severely 

declined and it is now known that other undocumented and unreported species 

followed the same pattern (Barker and Schluessel, 2005). Walker (1998) reported 

that chondrichtyans landings can exceed 700000 tons/year and the International 

Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) revealed that since 1992, some 

commercial fishing boats catch up to 40 tonnes of deep water sharks per week 



 18 

due to the increasing of their economic value and the high levels of bycatch (ICES, 

2013; Figueiredo, Bordalo-Machado et al. 2005).

 It is currently recognized that there is still a lack of information on the 

biology of deep-sea sharks, including life history, feeding and migratory habitats, 

but also on catch data (ICES, 2013). The major problems that compromise our 

knowledge of the status of deep-sea shark population, as well as other marine 

species, are the inaccurate identification of the lesser-known species, illegal, 

unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and lack of information on discarding 

practices for most deep-sea fisheries. Therefore, it is currently challenging to 

provide a complete assessment on the fishing impacts on deep-water shark 

populations (Coelho and Erzini, 2008; Blackwell and Stevenson, 2003; Martin and 

Treberg, 2002; Leitão, Baptista et al. 2014). 

 Deep-water rays have been also widely affected by the bycatch resultant 

from commercial fisheries once they have life history traits very similar to deep-

water sharks. The fishing pressure is showing to be a threat to these populations, 



 19 

and since the majority of these species (except Raja clavata) have no commercial 

value, they are usually discarded. 

 

 1.5. Deep-sea elasmobranchs in the Azores 

 

 The Azorean waters behold a high diversity of sharks and rays, constituting 

a valuable natural heritage that must be preserved. Until the present time, 8 

orders, 21 families and 50 species of Elasmobranchs have been recorded in the 

Azores. The main deep-water shark and rays species captured in the Azores in 

terms of weight and numbers are: 

 

 

 Kitefin shark, Dalatias licha: 

The kitefin is a relatively small shark (maximum length of 186 cm), found 

mostly on the continental shelf and slope and occurring mainly between 50 m and 

1800 m depth (Bordalo-Machado, Pinho et al. 2002). It is characterized by not 

having spines in dorsal fins, a short and conical snout, and a greyish/dark-brown 

body. Feeds mainly on deep-water bony fish. Targeted mainly for liver oil 

extraction. Its skin and meat is also used, especially for fish food production 

(Barreiros and Gadig, 2011 ; Fishbase).

 20 

 Leafscale gulper shark, Centrophorus squamosus: 

A small sized shark (largest known male with 160 cm) found on or near the 

bottom of continental slopes between 229 m and 2359 m (Compagno, 1984). It 

has 2 dorsal spines and an elongated, almost cylindrical body, uniformly dark-grey 

or brown. Feeds on deep-water fish and cephalopods. It is commonly captured for 

human consumption: even though the fins and meat (mostly dried salted) have low 

value, the liver oil has a high commercial value (Barreiros and Gadig, 2011; 

Fishbase).

Gadig, 2011). 

 

Arrowhead dogfish, Deania profundorum: 

A small shark (largest specimen with 79 cm) found in upper continental and 

insular slopes, ranging between 250 m and 1100 m (IUCN). It has 2 dorsal spines 

and a characteristic flattened head with a wide snout, and a uniformly brownish 

grey/dark grey body. Feed on small demersal and benthic fishes, cephalopods and 

crustaceans. Has no commercial value (Barreiros and Gadig, 2011; Fishbase).

Velvet belly lanternshark, Etmopterus spinax: 

A small sized shark (biggest known specimen with 60 cm) found on outer 

continental shelves and slopes and ranging between 200 m to 1200 m depth 

(Aranha, Menezes et al. 2009). It has a long snout and tail, with small gills and 

light-emitting photophores forming specific patterns. The body is brown, with black 

underside. Feeds on small fish, squids and crustaceans. Utilized for fishmeal and 

human consumption (dried salted) (Barreiros and Gadig, 2011; Fishbase).

Birdbeak dogfish, Deania calcea: 

A small shark (largest male with 122 cm) found on outer continental and 

insular shelves and slopes, with recorded depths from 70 m to 1450 m (Last and 

Stevens, 1994). Has 2 dorsal spines, and a flattened head with a large snout with 

rounded edge. The body is uniformly grey to dark brown. Feeds on pelagic fish, 

cephalopods and shrimps. Liver oil with high commercial value, unlike their meat 

and fins (Barreiros and Gadig, 2011; Fishbase).

Smooth lanternshark, Etmopterus pusillus: 

 A small sized shark (biggest specimen measuring 50 cm) found near the 

bottom of continental slopes at depths of 274 m to 1000 m (Whitehead et al. 

1986). It has 2 dorsal spines and a rounded snout, with the nostrils closer to the 

tip. The body is dark brown, with a black belly, paler fin edges and specific photo 

marks. Feeds on small deep-water sharks, fish eggs, and lanternfish. Utilized dried 

salted for human consumption and for fish meat (Barreiros and Gadig, 2011; 

Fishbase).

Longnose velvet dogfish, Centroscymnus crepidater: 

A small shark (biggest specimen with 110cm) found on the continental 

slope and near the bottom, being common in depths of 270 m to 1300 m (IUCN). It 

has 2 dorsal spines, and an elongated snout. Dark-brown/gold-brown body, with 

paler fins. Feeds on several fish and cephalopods. It has low commercial value 

since their meat has a high content of mercury (Barreiros and Gadig, 2011; 

Fishbase).

Portuguese dogfish, Centroscymnus coelolepis: 

A small sized shark (larger specimen with 120 cm) found in continental 

slopes and the abyssal plain, mainly between 500 m and 1700 m, even though it 

has been recorded at depths greater than 3000 m (Foster, 1973). It has 2 dorsal 

spines and a robust body, mostly dark-brown. Feeds on fish (sharks included), 

cephalopods, gastropods and even cetacean meat. Has a high squalene content 

in the liver (Barreiros and Gadig, 2011 ; Fishbase). 

 

 

Figure 11. Portuguese dogfish, Centroscymnus coelolepis (Source: Barreiros and Gadig,

Gulper shark, Centrophorus granulosus: 

It is a relatively big shark, reaching 170 cm. Found in outer continental 

shelves and upper slopes, ranging between 240 m and 2400 m (IUCN). It has 2 

dorsal spines and an elongated body, with large, oval shaped eyes. The body is 

usually dark-grey or brownish-grey. Feeds mainly on bony fishes, squid and 



 24 

crustaceans. It is marketed smoked and dried salted for human consumption and 

is also processed into fishmeal. It is a high source of squalene (Barreiros and 

Gadig, 2011; Fishbase).

Bluntose six-gill shark, Hexanchus griseus: 

A large sized shark (usually 420 cm) usually found near the bottom, and 

occasionally pelagic, ranging from the surface to at least 2000 m (IUCN). It has no 

dorsal spines and the head is large with a short and flattened nose. It has six pairs 

of gill slits, and a dark-brown body with white edges in the fins. Feeds on a wide 

range of marine animals. In some areas their meat is commercialized frozen or 

dried, and their carcass is usually used to make fish food (Barreiros and Gadig, 

2011; Fishbase).

Shortnose velvet dogfish, Centroscymnus cryptacanthus: 

A relatively small shark (biggest specimen measured 120 cm) found in 

upper continental shelves, on or near the bottom, ranging mainly between 274 m 

and 1000 m (IUCN). Robust body, usually dark-brown or black. Feeds on fish and 

cephalopods, and has low commercial value mainly due their high content in 

mercury (Barreiros and Gadig, 2011; Fishbase).

Thornback Ray, Raja clavata: 

Grows up to about 120 cm and inhabits shelf and upper slope waters, 

ranging from 10 m to about 300 m (Fishbase). It has a slightly protruding snout, 

has at least 30 irregular median thorns on the upper part of the tail, and the dorsal 

colour is highly variable. Feeds on several types of benthic organisms, but mainly 

crustaceans. It is the only ray with commercial value, being landed all year for 

human consumption, especially the pectoral fins (Barreiros and Gadig, 2011)

1.6. Objectives 

 

The main objective of this work is to characterize the catch of the deep-

water sharks in the Azores, a region where deep-water fisheries have a high 

economic and social importance, and at the same time harbours essential habitats 

for these species. Analyses of data from the last four decades provide the first 

account on deep-water shark bycatch in the Azores. 

A short account on the diversity and distribution of deep-sea sharks in 

Azorean waters is given to support the interpretation of catch data. Since very little 

is known about discard rates and bycatch consequences in this region, a special 

focus is given to this subject, therefore, the potential impacts of these practices are 

acknowledged and discussed.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  

 

 2.1. Study Area 

 

 The archipelago of the Azores is located in the northeast Atlantic (36 to 

40ºN, 24 to 32ºW) and is composed by 9 isolated volcanic islands distributed in 3 

groups: the oriental group (São Miguel and Santa Maria), the central group (Faial, 

São Jorge, Pico, Terceira and Graciosa) and the occidental group (Flores and 

Corvo). Those islands together with other small islets define the size of the Azores 

Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) with almost 1 million km2, and an average depth 

of approximately 3000 m (Morato, 2012). The Azores EEZ holds a great variety of 

deep-sea ecosystems and habitats, from seamounts to abyssal plains, island 

slopes and hydrothermal vents (Tempera, Pereira et al. 2012). The seafloor is 

tectonically active, irregular and rocky, therefore, the fishing grounds are highly 

limited to the shallow water bordering the islands and close to the seamounts and 

submarine banks (Menezes, Sigler et al. 2006).

 2.2. Description of the commercial fisheries  

 

 Fisheries in the Azores are multi-segmented, targeting multiple species 

inhabiting a wide range of habitats, and can be divided in four main categories: 

coastal fleet targeting mainly small pelagic fishes with nets, pole-and-line targeting 

tunas, the pelagic longline fleet targeting primarily swordfish and the bottom 

longline fleet targeting various demersal fishes.  

The small-scale fishery (using fishing boats smaller than 12 meters in 

length) in spite of being considered inefficient when compared with the large-scale 

fishery, is responsible for almost 52% of the total catches in the region (Carvalho 

and Isidro, 2011). This fleet usually operate in shelf slopes and continental shelf 

breaks, accessible to fishermen with small boats, and use mainly hand-operate 

nets, lift nets, purse seine or drop lines that are later collected by hand or with 

electric or hydraulic reels, targeting small pelagic fishes like Trachurus picturatus 

(Blue jack mackrel), Scomber japonicus (mackerel) and Sardina pilchardus 

(sardine) and having annual landings of about 1.4 million tonnes per year (Pham, 

Diogo et al. 2014 ; Morato, 2012 ; Carvalho and Isidro, 2011).  

The pole-and-line fishery is responsible for the majority of the catch 

occurring within the Azores EEZ. Total catch of tuna fluctuates between 3500 and 

14000 tonnes per year (Pham et al. 2013). Pole-and line is considered to be 

selective practice, having limited levels of bycatch. This technique relies on two 

stages: 1) catching small pelagic fishes that will later be used as bait and 2) fishing 

for the tuna. The fishing gear generally is a pole and a line, with a hook on it, and 

the bait depends on the morphology and behaviour of the target species. The main 

species caught in those fisheries are Thunnus obesus (big eye tuna), Katsuwonus 

pelamis (skipjack tuna) and to a lesser extent Thunnus alalunga (albacore), 

Thunnus albacares (yellowfin tuna) and Thunnus thynnus (Atlantic bluefin tuna) 

(Morato, 2012). 

The large pelagic vessels are also widely used in the Azores, they are in 

average 18 m long, host different gear types and have a high catch capacity, using 

more effective fishing techniques (Carvalho and Isidro, 2011; Ruttan, Gayanilo Jr. 

et al. 2000). They are used to catch swordfish and to a lesser extent blue sharks. 



 29 

This fishing gear was first introduced in 1987, with official landings ranging 

between 25 to 450 tonnes per year (Pham et al. 2013). 

Lastly, the fourth and second most important component of the Azorean 

fishing industry in terms of landed weight and value is the demersal fleet, which 

uses bottom longline and handline, since bottom trawling has been prohibited 

(EC1568/2005, 2005; Carvalho and Isidro, 2011). Total catches of this component 

ranges between 3500 and 4500 tonnes per year. The bottom longline is a fishing 

gear that is comprised of a main line, with several branch lines attached and hooks 

placed on the end of them. This device has many alternative buoys and weights 

placed in constant intervals of the main line, and it can range from depths from 

800 to 1450 m (Figure 17) (Ramos, Silva et al. 2013; Morato, 2012). The same 

happens with the handlines, but the main gear type consists in a line with several 

hooks attached.

Recently, the exploitation of a new resource, black scabbard fish 

(Aphanopus carbo) has begun in Azorean waters using drifting bottom longline. It 

is a selective fishing gear and it can range from depths between 1000 m to 1900 m 

(Besugo, 2013). It is comprised of a main line, connected with other secondary, 

vertical lines (free lines), with hooks placed on the lower end, and buoys on the 

upper end (Figure 18). The size of the gear, hooks and the material, depends 

mainly on the target species, but also on the vessels and the fishermen (Machete, 

Morato et al. 2011; Domingo, Forselledo et al. 2014). At present, official statistics 

suggest catches are relatively low, ranging from 50 to 450 tonnes per year.

2.3 Fisheries catch data  

 

 Official and "illegal, unreported and unregulated" (IUU) catch data were 

used to characterize the catch of deep-water sharks in the Azores. Both of the 

data sets were compiled and estimated by Pham et al. (2013). The official data 

were obtained from several landing databases recorded by regional and national 

authorities from 1950 to 2014, but for this study only the last 4 decades (1974 to 

2014) were analysed. The data from 2010 to 2014 is derivative from unpublished 

work. 

Estimation of IUU catch for the demersal fleet was based on data collected 

by fishery observers, according to a stratified random sampling scheme, based on 

fishing gear and the fleets by a Observer Programme for the Discards in Azorean 



 32 

fisheries, PORPESCA (Pham et al. 2013). In the Azores, the IUU catches of the 

demersal fleet consists primarily of bycatch and discards since very little illegal 

fishing activities currently exist. From the 24 elasmobranchs identified in the 

catches, 17 were deep-water sharks. Catches were analysed in detail for the most 

caught 9 species in terms of weight.   

 

2.4 Fishing surveys data 

 

In addition, and to complement this work, data from scientific fishing 

surveys was used to further describe the deep-water shark diversity and 

distribution in the Azores. 

These surveys were carried out between 1996 and 2011, however no data 

is available for 1998 and 2006, and in 2009 only a few sets were performed. 

Therefore the data sets from these years were excluded from the analyses. In total 

481 longline sets were analysed. These were performed mainly around the nine 

islands and in the main seamounts and banks (Figure 19) using the R/V 

“Arquipélago”, with a mean depth of 525 m and a minimum and maximum depth of 

16 m and 2476 m, respectively. The bottom longline surveys followed a 

standardized methodology designed to monitor Azorean demersal and deep-water 

fish species (Menezes, Sigler et al. 2006). 

During gear deployment, the start and end of each 50 m depth stratum was 

registered. For all the depth intervals, we recorded the initial and final position of 

the stratum, and the total fish catch (total weight and number of individuals), as 

well as the effort associated (except for 2010). For the 9 most caught deep-water 

species the number of individuals landed was also registered. Since the fishing 

sets, locations, depth and effort, were not constant every year, the analysis of the 

variation of the total weight per year would not be completely accurate (Table 1). 

Catch per unit effort (CPUE), in this case the number of individuals caught by 1000 

hooks, where the fishing effort was distributed through the years, mainly from 

March to November, was also computed.  

A Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to investigate annual differences in the 

mean weight of the captured species; the null hypothesis was that the species 



 33 

mean weight was not significantly different through the years. This test was 

combined to the Bonferroni–Dunn test to allow multiple comparisons. Dunn's test 

is a not parametric analog where we can highlight where are the significant 

differences using multiple, stepdown comparisons. 

 

 

 

 

Figure 19 - Representation of the sets performed (red lines) in the Azores between 1996 

and 2011. 

 
 

Data organization and assemblage as well as statistical analyses to 

represent the average CPUE per year, the depth ranges and the species mean 

weight through the years were performed using Microsoft Office Excel (Microsoft 

Office © 2007). This software and SigmaPlot (version 11.0) were used to create all 

graphs. The program ArcMap 10.0 © ESRI was used for the construction of the 

maps and the visual representation of the sets performed on the experimental 

surveys. The Kruskal-Wallis and Bonferroni–Dunn tests were performed on the 

software GrapPad Prism 6 © 2015.

3. RESULTS  

 

 3.1. Official Landings and IUU catch 

Table 2 presents a summary of the differences between the reported and 

IUU catch of deep-sea sharks (orders Carcharhiniformes, Hexanchiformes and 

Squaliformes) and rays (orders Myliobatiformes, Rajiformes and 

Torpediniformes) in the last 4 decades. The total weight of the reported catches, 

approximately 13428 tonnes, greatly exceeded that of IUU ones (~ 8400 tonnes). 

However, this value (13428 tonnes) is almost completely due to the catch of only 

two species, Dalatias licha and Raja clavata.  

Dalatias licha represents almost 53% of the total catches and about 98% of 

the sharks reported values. The second deep-water shark with the highest reported 

catch is Centrophorus lusitanicus, even though it is known that this species does 

not dwell in Azorean waters (Correia, 2009) suggesting that other species were 

landed and identified as Centrophorus lusitanicus, as its fishing is allowed. 

The IUU catches are mainly represented by seven different species, the 

most caught being Centrophorus squamosus, which contributes to almost 40% of 

the deep-water sharks IUU catches.  

Regarding rays, Raja clavata shows the highest values both on the official 

and IUU catches, while other species have only been recorded in IUU data.  

It is worth noting that from the 23 species of elasmobranchs, only 11 of them 

are landed, while 20 are usually discarded.

Species

 



1) Within the 178 species caught by those gear types, 17 of them were deep-water 

sharks.  37 

The patterns in total catch of deep-water sharks (Figure 20) reflect key 

events in the Azorean fisheries. The increase in deep-water sharks caught from 

the late seventies until the early 1990´s can be mainly attributed to the Dalatias 

licha direct fishery. Together with the introduction of the bottom longline in 1984, 

the total annual catches in that year and the following show a dramatic increase, 

but it was only between 1987 and 1991 that the annual values increase steadily 

until they reach its peak in 1991 with almost 1200 tonnes. Since then, the values 

started to gradually decline and in the last 15 years they remained relatively stable 

at about 200 tonnes per year.

Figure 20. Annual catches of deep-water sharks, divided into reported and IUU catches 

from 1974 to 2014. 

 

The proportion of deep-water sharks (%DWS) in relation to other species 

captured by bottom fishing methods (1), such as bottom trawling, bottom handline 

and drifting pelagic longline, follows a trend similar to that presented in Figure 20, 

with the exception that the higher values occurred in 1981, with almost 35% of the 

total catches (Figure 21). 

 It can be observed an increase until the mid-80s, followed by a decrease 

and then a stabilization from 1997 until the end of the study in 2014, with a mean 

proportion of 4.5%. 



 38 

When comparing the reported and IUU catches per year, the official 

component of fisheries dominates between 1974 and 1995 (Figure 20) reaching its 

highest value in 1981 with about 966 tonnes. In 1991 another peak on official 

landings was observed (896 tonnes) and since then it started to decline. By the 

year 1996, the unreported values exceed the reported ones, a trend that was 

observed until the end of the study in 2014. IUU catches reached their peak in 

1998, with 319 tonnes. Even though the IUU values only surpassed the reported 

values in 1996, they have been relatively stable at a mean of 232 tonnes per year 

since 1989.

Figure 21. Proportion of deep-water sharks (%DWS) in relation to total catch by bottom 

fishing methods. 

 

Trend analyses of the percentage of IUU catches show that these values 

have been high during most of the studied time (Figure 22). Only between 1977 

and 1995 they have maintained values below 50%. In the year 2014 the values 

have reached the highest percentages, close to 100%. Regression analyses show 

a linear relation between time and the % of IUU catches (r=0.892; p=&amp;lt;0.0001).

Analyses of the catch trend of the nine most caught deep-water 

elasmobranch species (Figure 23) show that six of these species (Centrophorus 

squamosus, Centrophorus granulosus, Deania profundorum, Deania calcea 

Etmopterus spinax, and Etmopterus pusillus) have a similar pattern: the harvesting 

data begin in 1984, there is a peak in 1988 and the unreported values always 

predominate over the reported ones. From 1988, the values slowly decline, with a 

few irregular high peaks, but from 2011 to 2014 they raise again in all the six 

species, even though with different landing weights. Etmopterus pusillus and 

Centrophorus squamosus are the only species that have never been officially 

landed. The other four species have been reported but the captures never 

surpassed 6 tonnes per year.  

The deep-water shark Hexanchus griseus also shows a similar trend to 

these six species, but with the exception that it started being caught in 1974. In 

addition, there was an unusual peak of reported catches in 1981. 

Dalatias licha is the only species with more reported landings than 

unreported catches. From 1987 to 1992 the capture values tend to increase, and 

from there they start to slowly decrease. A marked difference was observed 

between the years 1996 and 1997 when the values dropped dramatically.  From 

1997, the decrease is gradual until 2011, the last year with reported catches.  

Concerning the IUU, from 1974 to 1997 the values were relatively low but show a 

steady increase. From there, the IUU catches were fairly stable, even though they 

gradually decreased. 

Finally, Centrophorus lusitanicus is the only species with only reported 

catches and those only began in 2007 and continued until 2013. Those values 

started below 1 tonne and increased to almost 70 tonnes in 2013.

3.2. Fishing Surveys 

  

The fishing surveys performed in the Azores between 1996 and 2011 

resulted in the identification of 28 deep-water elasmobranchs, including 20 sharks 

of 8 different families (Table 3) that accounted for 66 % (9.2 tonnes) of the total 

weight of elasmobranchs captured. The top 3 species captured in terms of weight 

were Deania profundorum, Deania calcea and Dalatias licha, but in terms of 

number of individuals were Etmopterus spinax, Deania profundorum and Deania 

calcea. 

These species were captured at a mean depth ranging from 208 m to 1085 

m. The widest depth ranges were observed in Etmopterus spinax (from 112 m to 

1200 m), Etmopterus pusillus (from 112 m to 1195 m) and Deania calcea (from 

335 m to 1296 m). Species caught in the greater mean depth were 

Centroscymnus coelolepis (1085 m), Etmopterus princeps (1064 m) and 

Centroscymnus crepidater (1049 m).  Some of the species with a shallower mean 

depth were also the ones with the lower number of individuals caught 

(Heptranchias perlo, Charcarias taurus and Hexanchus griseus). 

The capture depth range of the nine most frequent deep-water sharks is 

represented in Figure 24. The relatively small boxplots of the species Etmopterus 

spinax, Dalatias licha, Deania profundorum and Centroscymnus crepidater 

indicate a high level of aggregation between their respective depths. The boxplot 

of the species Etmopterus pusillus and Centroscymnus cryptacanthus are 

comparatively taller, showing that they have a higher depth range and are more 

disperse. There are 3 distinctive groups where 50% of the individuals form 

aggregations at similar depth ranges: Etmopterus spinax and Dalatias licha form 

aggregations at about 600 m, Etmopterus pusillus and Deania profundorum form 

aggregations at 700 m, and the remaining species (Censtroscymnus 

cryptacanthus, Centrophorus squamosus, Deania calcea, Centroscymnus 

crepidater and Centroscymnus coelepis) assemble between 1000 m and 1100 m.

experimental longline surveys performed in the Azores between 1996 and 2011 (the black 

line represents the median and the error bars are represent in the 90th and 10th 

percentile) 

 

In the species Etmopterus spinax, Etmopterus pusillus and Deania 

profundorum we can see a symetrical distribution of the species.  

Even thought Etmopterus spinax have a relatively low median value when 

compared with their depth range, with the representation of the 90th percentile, it 

is possible to see that 40% of the individuals range between the median and 

almost 700 m. The same happens with Etmopterus pusillus, with 40% of the 

individuals ranging between 700 m and 1000 m.  



 45 

Regarding the deep-water rays, they represented about 34% of the 

elasmobranchs catches, with the species Raja clavata contributing for 78% of 

those values. 

 Ten species of deep-water sharks were caught in relatively low numbers, 

and therefore it can be assumed that those species are not very common in 

Azorean waters and/or do not have a similar distribution to the other species. 

Interestingly, the species with the greatest importance to commercial fisheries, 

Centrophorus squamosus and Centroscymnus coelolepis, commonly called as 

"siki", were not captured in large numbers. Of these two species, only 138 

individuals were caught, representing only 10% of the deep-water shark fishery in 

terms of weight (0.93 tonnes). 

Analyses of catch per unit effort (CPUE) (Figure 25) show that the species 

with higher CPUE were Etmopterus spinax (5 ± 2 individuals per 1000 hooks), 

Deania profundorum (4 ± 1 individuals per 1000 hooks) and Deania calcea (2.2 ± 

0.25 individuals per 1000 hooks). Deania calcea presented an increasing trend in 

the average CPUE from 1999 to 2004. From there, the values dropped and remain 

lower. The same did not happen with Deania profundorum and Etmopterus spinax 

that show irregular high and low CPUE within the study period, with the exception 

that Etmopterus spinax shows a decrease from 2003 to 2011.  

The CPUE of Etmopterus pusillus showed 3 increasing periods: between 

1999 and 2001, 2003 to 2005, and then from 2007 to 2011, reaching the higher 

value in 2001 with an average of 1.4 (± 0.4) individuals per 1000 hooks, but each 

of those increase periods are less accentuated than the other. The CPUE for both 

Centroscymnus crepidater and Centroscymnus cryptacanthus showed high inter-

annual variability, increasing and decreasing every other year, but Centroscymnus 

crepidater presented generally higher values and a stabilization of the values 

between 2004 and 2008. 

 Centrophorus squamosus presented the lower CPUE, showing the highest 

average CPUE of 0.11 (± 0.05) individuals per 1000 hooks in 2002. CPUE for 

Centroscymnus coelolepis was 0 during 5 years, and presented relatively low 

values, but with large error bars in the remaining years. In 2011 it reached its 



 46 

highest CPUE, when normally the other species presented one of their lower catch 

rates. 

CPUE of Dalatias licha showed two visible trends: an increase from the 

beginning of the study to 2005 (except from 2000 to 2001), and a decrease from 

then onwards, having a value near to 0 in 2011. 

For almost all the species, the first two years present the lower average 

CPUE values.  

Figure 26 shows the mean weight variation of the 9 most captured species 

through the years. Statistical analysis (Kruskal-wallis test) showed that there were 

no significant annual differences in the mean weights of the species Dalatias licha 

(P=0.7661), Centroscymnus cryptacanthus (P=0.4093) and Centroscymnus 

crepidater (P=0.0664). However, in the species Centrophorus squamosus 

(P=0.0353), Deania calcea (P=&lt;0,0001), Centroscymnus coelolepis (P=0.0217), 

Deania profundorum (P=&lt;0,0001), Etmopterus pusillus (P=&lt;0,0001) and 

Etmopterus spinax (P=&lt;0,0001) significant annual differences were detected. 

Results of a Dunn’s test show the years with significant differences (Table 4).

4. DISCUSSION 

 

Total catch estimates in the Azores suggest that 203 different species have 

been landed between 1974 and 2014 (ICES, 2013). These include a wide variety 

of groups, such as algae, cephalopods, fishes, marine mammals and crustaceans, 

having a total weight of about 272294 tonnes. The reported landings of the 

identified species have a total weight of about 213883 tonnes, while the IUU catch 

have a total weight of 58411 tonnes. When analysing our group of interest, the 

deep-sea elasmobranchs - 17 species of deep-sea sharks and 6 species of deep-

sea rays - they contribute to 6.28% of reported catches, and 14.38% of the IUU 

catch, concluding that this group suffers a great pressure from the IUU fishing. 

As shown in Table 2, reported catches (13428 tonnes) are higher than IUU 

catches (~ 8400 tonnes). It is important to note that catches of the kitefin shark, 

Dalatias licha, comprise about 79% of this amount, which can be explained by the 

fact that the direct fisheries of this species were permitted until the middle of 

1990s.  

The small catch values (both official and IUU) observed between 1997 and 

2014 (Figure 20) reflect the implementation of fishing regulations including Total 

Allowable Catches (TACs) that limit the amount of fishes that can be caught, over 

a given period of time, in a specific stock. Therefore, from the 23 species of 

elasmobranchs caught, only 11 were officially landed, with relatively low values, 

whilst 20 have IUU values, indicating that they are mostly discarded. 

TACs are set annually, based on the ICES scientific advice (ICES, 2013).  

For example, TACs for deep-water shark species in the EU were set to 0 in 2010, 

and since then, reported values were relatively low ranging from about 70 tonnes 

in 2013 to about 0.2 tonnes in 2014. Those catches (70 tonnes) are mostly 

composed of Centrophorus lusitanicus a species that doesn’t dwell in Azorean 

waters and that is not subject to the TACs regulations. Therefore, the report of 

Centrophorus lusitanicus landings must result from misidentification problems. 

Ramos et al., (2013) reported that in 2010, 93% of Centrophorus squamosus 

individuals were marked as Centrophorus lusitanicus.  



 51 

For other species (Centrophorus granulosus, Centroscymnus crepidater, 

Centroscymnus cryptacanthus, Dalatias licha, Deania calcea, Deania 

profundorum, Heptranchias perlo and Hexanchus griseus), the reported values 

since 2010 never surpassed 2.7 tonnes per year. This value (2.7 tonnes) is mainly 

derivative from the catches of Deania calcea in 2010, the last year with reported 

landings; the landing values of the other species barely surpass one tonne per 

year.  Due to the implementation of the TACs, the IUU values tend to raise every 

year and it is believed that the discard rates in mixed deep-water fisheries has 

significantly increased. The values derived from the period 2010 to 2014 are 

similar to those observed from 2001 forward, and this can be explained with the 

implementation of quotas for the deep-water species. As a result, it is believed that 

some vessels may have logged some deep-water sharks as other species. 

Centrophorus squamosus was the species with the highest IUU value, contributing 

with almost 40% of the deep-water shark IUU catches. It has been previously 

reported (Machete and Santos, 2007) that this species represents a large share in 

the bycatch resultant of the black scabbard fish fisheries in the Azores, along with 

two other shark species: Etmopterus spinax and Centroscymnus cryptacanthus. 

Although Etmopterus spinax represents about 7% of the IUU catches, 

Centroscymnus cryptacanthus does not contribute to a significant share of the 

landings, both reported and IUU. 

The fisheries of the kitefin shark, Dalatias licha, in the Azores began around 

the 1970s resulting in high official catches until the end of the 1990s, when it 

stopped in result of low profit margins. Catch values changed every other year, 

due to the fluctuation of the market, having high peaks in 1981 and 1991. Since 

2000, the reported values dramatically decreased, ranging from 35 tonnes in 2002 

to about one tonne in 2011, the last year with reported values. This species has 

always been present as bycatch in other fisheries, and since 2010 the IUU values 

remained relatively stable at a mean of approximately 27 tonnes per year, mainly 

to management restrictions.  

The remaining species have low reported landings, due to the 

implementations of TACs as it was mentioned before. In 2010, TACs were 

reduced to 0 with an allowance for bycatch of 10% of 2009 TACs, and by 2011 it 



 52 

was reduced to 3%. By 2012, no allowance for bycatch was authorized (ICES, 

2013). Consequently, the IUU values tend to rise as a result of the restricted 

quotas implemented, and other measures such as minimum mesh sizes, minimum 

sizes and weights, bans of specific gear types (EC1568/2005, 2005), along with 

the bycatch of the mixed fisheries, especially since 1984 with the introduction of 

the bottom longline in the Azorean fisheries.  

The deep-water rays are also included in the EU TACs for “Skates and 

Rays Rajidae”, given that some of these species have high commercial value, 

especially Raja clavata.   

 Within the shark species landed, the IUCN red list assessments classifies 

as:  

? Data deficient: Etmopterus princeps; Scymnodon obscurus. 

? Least Concern: Deania profundorum; Etmopterus spinax; Deania 

calcea; Etmopterus pusillus; Centroscymnus crepidater; 

Centroscymnus cryptacanthus; Pseudotriakis microdon. 

? Near Threatened: Dalatias licha; Hexanchus griseus; Somniosus 

microcephalus; Heptranchias perlo; Centroscymnus coelolepis. 

? Vulnerable: Centrophorus squamosus; Centrophorus granulosus; 

Centrophorus lusitanicus. 

 

Centrophorus squamosus and Centrophorus granulosus, classified as 

vulnerable (high risk of endangerment in the wild), are two of the three species 

with the highest landings, especially regarding IUU values, which gives them a 

very uncertain and worrying future. The near threatened species (likely to become 

endangered in the near future), mainly Dalatias licha and Hexanchus griseus, 

should also become a priority in the fisheries management. 

When it comes to the proportion of deep water sharks (%DWS) captured in 

relation to other species by bottom fishing methods (Figure 21), since 1997 the 

values tend to stay stable at a mean of 4.5%, but it’s still a high value to ensure 

the sustainability of long-term fisheries, and the survival of these species, 

especially the ones referred as vulnerable and near threatened.   



 53 

With the implementation of the quotas, the IUU catches tend to rise (Figure 

22). The low values of IUU landings between 1977 and 1995 can be explained by 

the low commercial value of some species, and the permission of the direct 

fisheries in some species, especially Dalatias licha. After that, the IUU values 

increased every other year, reaching almost 100%. The results herein presented 

together with those reported by Pham et al. (2013) clearly demonstrate that with 

the implementations of TACs, the discard rates greatly increased without 

decreasing the catch levels.  

 In the fisheries surveys performed in the Azores between 1996 and 2011, 

34 species of elasmobranchs were captured. The deep-water sharks accounted 

for about 50% of the total weight. Deania calcea, Deania profundorum and 

Dalatias licha were the top 3 species captured in terms of weight, but when it 

comes to numbers, Etmopterus spinax replaced Dalatias licha in the top. From 

these species, Dalatias licha was the only one that entered the top 3 of the official 

landings. 

Regarding the capture depth ranges (Figure 24), it is important to refer that 

the recorded depths belong to the depth stratum where the fishery occurs, not 

corresponding to the actual structure of deep-sea shark populations analyzed. 

However, the survey results were consistent with those published for all studied 

species except Etmopterus pusillus and Centroscymnus cryptacanthus that have 

been captured at greater depths than previously reported (presented in the 

Introduction). 

The species belonging to the family Etmopteridae (Etmopterus spinax and 

Etmopterus pusillus), are among the ones with the highest number of individuals 

caught, but they are also the ones that dwell at the lower depths, suggesting that 

species that inhabit in lower depths are more susceptible to the fishing gears 

targeting demersal and deep-water species, and therefore more vulnerable. 

Dalatias licha is also mostly caught at similar depths, but was not as abundant 

compared to other species. Deania calcea, Centroscymnus crepidater and 

Centroscymnus coelolepis were caught at deeper waters than the other species, 

but Centroscymnus crepidater and Centroscymnus coelolepis have lower landing 

numbers when compared with Deania calcea, which could be explained by their 



 54 

depth range. Centroscymnus crepidater and Centroscymnus coelolepis form 

aggregates at higher depths and are not as dispersed in shallower depths as 

Deania calcea, being therefore less susceptible to the fishing gears. The 

occurrence of Centroscymnus coelolepis in these type of fisheries can be 

explained by its primarily scavenging behaviour (Menezes et al. 2009). Some 

authors have also suggested that Centroscymnus coelolepis may be less 

vulnerable to over fishing given their widespread depth distribution. The same may 

happen with Centroscymnus cryptacanthus that although it has a large depth 

range, 50% of the individuals assemble at about 1100 m, explaining their low 

captures in numbers. These depth aggregates can be a result of various 

conditions, including sex, maturity stage, size, different prey preferences and even 

avoidance of feeding competition with larger specimens (Clarke et al. 2001; 

Ramos, Silva et al. 2013).   

 The analyses of the average CPUE of the top 9 deep-water shark species 

(Figure 25) showed that the species with higher CPUE were Etmopterus spinax, 

Deania profundorum and Deania calcea. CPUE values for Deania calcea showed 

an increasing trend from 1999 to 2004, which demonstrate a high fishing pressure 

leading to a presumed decreased of the population size, with a decrease in the 

average CPUE in the following years. Deania profundorum showed low CPUE in 

the first years, and a large increase in 2002. Since then, the values showed great 

variations, which could indicate fluctuations in the population size every other year. 

The species with the higher CPUE average, Etmopterus spinax, showed high 

captures up until 2003, even though those values present fluctuations. From 2003 

until the end of the study the values tended to decrease, suggesting that this 

species abundance have been previously disturbed and exposed to possible 

overexploitation. Etmopterus pusillus showed three increasing periods, which 

means that there were two periods where the species abundance declined: 

between 2002 and 2004, and 2005 to 2007. Since there is no available data for 

2006, it is not possible to conclude what happened during that period. Although 

Centroscymnus crepidater CPUE values had 3 high peaks (2000, 2002 and 2003), 

the rest of the years appear to be relatively stable, with low fluctuations every 

other year, with a visible stabilization between 2004 and 2008, which could mean 



 55 

sustainable harvesting of this species. Centroscymnus cryptacanthus also showed 

variations in the average CPUE, having 4 years with 0 CPUE, which suggests that 

this species is more rarely caught than the others. The species Centrophorus 

squamosus and Centroscymnus coelolepis, also presented fluctuations in the 

average CPUE, but Centroscymnus coelolepis showed 5 years with 0 CPUE 

which may mean that this species has a different distribution then the others or its 

population has decreased. Finally, Dalatias licha showed an increase in the 

average CPUE up until 2005, and then a decrease, until the end of the study. 

Since it was a very popular species until the end of the 1990s, it is possible that 

this decrease is related with the prohibition of its direct fishery.  

 Generally, the CPUE analysis always shows increasing and decreasing 

trends that accompany the declines and recovery of populations. This monitoring 

should be maintained in the future to ensure suitable management of the 

resources. 

There is not enough information avalailable regarding deep-sea sharks and 

their biology, specially regarding their mean weight. Therefore, the mean weight 

per year analyses performed in this study have almost no data for comparison. 

The only species with information available are Dalatias licha, with a mean weight 

of 8 kg (eol.org), Etmopterus spinax, with a maximum published weight of 850 g 

(Fishbase), Centroscymnus coelolepis, with a mean weight of 20 kg (Parker and 

Francis, 2012) and Deania calcea with a recorded mean weigh of 2.61 kg (Clarke, 

2000). 

 Although the mean weight per year of the 9 most caught species does not 

seem to present high variations with time, the results of a Kruskal-Wallis test 

showed that only three species (Centroscymnus cryptacanthus, Dalatias licha and 

Centroscymnus crepidater) do not present significant differences in their mean 

weight though the years which could mean that they are less influenced by fishing 

practices, maintaining their mean weight stable over the years. Based on a 

relationship between the average CPUE and mean weight we suggest that in 

some cases, when values are varying in opposite directions (for example, the 

decrease of the CPUE values and increase of the mean weight), they are 

correlated. The mean weight of Dalatias licha obtained in this study was similar to 



 56 

the one reported in the literature (8 kg; eol.org). This may suggest that fishing has 

not reduced the species average size. Their mean individual size can be related 

with their average CPUE: when the mean CPUE start to decline (mainly in 2007 

and 2008), this species recovers, having a higher mean weight in those years. 

Therefore we can conclude that the decreasing CPUE in the last years is not 

related to a decreasing abundance of the population but a decrease in the 

catches. Regarding the other 2 species (Centroscymnus cryptacanthus and 

Centroscymnus crepidater), and relating the mean weight values with the average 

CPUE, it can be observed that Centroscymnus cryptacanthus shows an increase 

in the mean weight when the average CPUE stabilized, between 2003 and 2004. 

In the case of Centroscymnus crepidater, the years with the lowest mean weight 

(2003 and 2004) may result from the high peaks of CPUE from 2002 and 2003. 

However, these differences were not significant.   

Significant differences were detected for the remaining species. In 

Centrophorus squamosus, the only years with significant differences detected 

were 2007 and 2010, were the species suffer a difference of nearly 5 kg in the 

mean weight. Deania calcea showed several years with significant differences, as 

well as Deania profundorum, Etmopterus pusillus and Etmopterus spinax. In 

Etmopterus pusillus, 2002 was the year with the most significant differences, when 

compared with the other years, and in Deania profundorum, 2002 and 2005. 

Finally, for Etmopterus spinax, 1999 and 2001 were the years with the higher 

significant differences, recording two of the years with the lowest mean recorded 

weight. The weight differences in Centroscymnus coelolepis are particularly 

evident between 2004 and 2011. 

 Centrophorus squamosus showed one of the higher mean weights in 2007, 

were the CPUE is close to 0. From 2003 to 2007 it presented an increase in the 

mean weight and low CPUE values, suggesting that the species were recovering 

from the higher landings in the past years. 

In Deania calcea, the mean weight tend to fluctuate between the different 

years and in 2007 it presented the highest mean weight, also corresponding to 

one of the lowest CPUE values, showing a recovery. The mean weight reported in 

the northeast Atlantic (2.61 kg; Clarke, 2000), match the ones registered by these 



 57 

experimental surveys, so we can conclude that this species can more easily 

recover from the fishing pressure when compared to other species.  

 The mean weight of Centroscymnus coelolepis drastically decreases with 

the increase of the CPUE, meaning that this species is very vulnerable to fishing. It 

is also important to refer that this species is not caught in the surveys every year, 

and when it is, the mean weight never surpass the 8 kg. When compared to the 

mean weight reported by Parker and Francis (2012) of 20 kg, it could mean that 

Centroscymnus coelolepis landings are mainly composed by juveniles and that 

they are more vulnerable to fishing than adults, or they have different distributions. 

It has been reported that this species have preferential distribution of young 

specimens at greater depths and of pregnant females in the upper strata (Clarke, 

2000). To complement the current study, an evaluation of the size and maturity 

stage of the caught individuals would be very important. The constant low weight 

of Centroscymnus coelolepis may also explain the decrease in “siki” landings: this 

species was very popular in the past commercial fisheries, but since the 

populations started to decline and being severely affected, it has become much 

less common in present commercial fisheries.  

Deania profundorum showed one of the higher mean weights in the 

beginning of the study up until 2001, where the CPUE values were close to 0 and 

this species was rarely caught. Since then, the mean weight has been slowly 

decreasing, and in 2005 shows the lowest mean weight. In 2004 high CPUE 

values were recorded, suggesting that the species suffered from high fishing 

pressure that year and remained affected until the next year, demonstrating their 

low capability of recovery.  

Etmopterus pusillus showed weight fluctuations throughout the years that 

cannot be entirely correlated to the CPUE values, which could mean that this 

species is not being greatly affected by fishing practices.  

Statistical analyses showed that Etmopterus spinax weight was lowest in 

1999 and 2001 when compared to other years. The low value registered in 2001 

can be correlated with the high CPUE value, affecting the species up to 2008, 

when the mean weight increased and the average CPUE decreased. Etmopterus 

spinax has been described as having a mean weight of 0,85 kg (Fishbase), which 



 58 

is a lot higher that the weight registered in the fishing surveys. Assuming that the 

individuals caught are mainly juvenils and that this species can not easily recover 

when target of fishing practices, it is possible to define Etmopterus spinax is 

particularly susceptible to overexploitation. Both Etmopterus spinax and Deania 

calcea have one of the greatest average CPUE values, and both of them show 

decreasing patterns from 2004 until the end of the study, suggesting that both 

these species are the ones that are most affected and vulnerable to 

overexploitation, especially Etmopterus spinax, since, as referred before, the 

landed individuals may all be juveniles. 

 The combination of the results of the landing, IUU and survey data show 

that some species may be more vulnerable to fishing practices than others, and 

than those take more time to recover. If these particular species continue to be 

affected by fishing, they can easily be lead to extinction, especially the ones 

already registered as Near Threatned or Vulnerable by the IUCN. 

This study shows an increasing trend of the IUU catches. Although it has 

been reported that bycatch rates have been slowly declining all over the world, this 

decrease may have been a result from the decline of the global catch rate, 

indicating a decrease of the total availability of fish, rather than a more 

cauticioness managament of the unselective fishing practices and gears (Zeller 

and Pauly, 2005). The same maybe happening with deep-sea sharks: results 

show a declining in the landings, but are the fisheries being adapted to these 

species or have the population sizes decreased over time? 

 It is well known that even small changes in species populations can change 

the whole ecosystem. At species level, a high fishing pressure can result in 

changes in species abundance and population size, but when taken in account the 

consequences at a higher level, it can affect trophic interactions and the whole 

community function (Stevens, Bonfil et al. 2000). Concerning deep-sea sharks, 

attention needs to be focused on these poorly studied species, particularly in the 

context of the entire ecosystem for a better understanding of the consequences of 

population changes in the trophic interactions, and to be able to avoid negative 

impacts in the future.

5. CONCLUSION 

 

 As already pointed out in this study, there is a large lack of information 

regarding deep-sea species, in particular, deep-water sharks. Herein we identify a 

need for more accurate taxonomic identification and collection of data regarding 

the species landed, as well as a more descriptive study of those species, 

especially the ones that are less-known. It is important to understand species 

biological traits, such as growth for further comparison with future works in the 

same field and update of fishing statistics. Also, a better knowledge of their 

reprodutive ecology, as well as behaviour, such as spatial movement patterns and 

locations of parturition is of great importance, and would be a major improvement,  

to prevent high rates of bycath in sensitive areas (Parker and Francis, 2012).  

There is also a clear need to better quantify bycatch and discard practices through 

the implementation of observer programs. 

The study of deep-sea sharks fisheries, bycatch and discard is still in its 

infancy and is particularly challenging since there are many problems that can be 

masked and difficult to control. Fisheries management and long term sustainability 

are of utmost importance and  therefore, research to understand the effects and 

consequences of bycatch is essential. The establishment of precautionary quotas 

and size limits to avoid overfishing should be considerate a priority. Further, other 

problems such as the waste derivative from finning practices as finning should be 

taken in consideration in the near future: it is recommended that once the species 

are landed the carcass should have full utilization (Kjerstad, Fossen et al. 2003).  

Finally, one of the top priorities should be the research of effective practices 

such as fishing gears modifications and balanced harvesting methods that can 

decrease the high rates of deep-sea species bycatch, and promote an effective 

system of control, enforcement and inspection, including the fighting against IUU 

fishing activities, while encouraging the sustainability of long-term fisheries 

(Musick, Burgess et al. 2000).
