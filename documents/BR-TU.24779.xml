Abstract

This work intends to examine if there are associations between fish species and the state of conservation of the riparian 
forest in the Corumbataí River Basin. Four main rivers were chosen for this study with three sites on each. Collections 
were carried out from March to June and from September to December 2001. Multivariate techniques were applied to 
determine the correlation between species richness and the order of the rivers, preservation level of the riparian forest, 
shade level, presence or absence of Eucalyptus, sugar cane and pastures, and surrounding declivity stability of the sites. 
Species richness was highest at locations with greater vegetation cover and preserved riparian forest. 

Keywords: Paraná River Basin, Corumbataí river, fish assemblage, riparian vegetation.

Associações entre assembléia de peixes e a mata ciliar na bacia do rio Corumbataí (SP)

Resumo

Este trabalho teve o objetivo de examinar se existem associações entre as espécies de peixes e o estado de conservação 
das matas ciliares na bacia do rio Corumbataí. Foram escolhidos 4 rios principais com 3 pontos de coleta em cada um. 
Foram realizadas coletas nos períodos de março a junho e de setembro a dezembro de 2001. Técnicas multivariadas 
foram aplicadas para determinar a correlação entre a riqueza de espécies e a ordem dos rios, estado de preservação da 
mata ciliar, sombreamento, presença ou ausência de Eucalyptus, cana-de-açúcar e pastagens, e nível de estabilidade 
do barranco ao redor dos pontos de coleta. A riqueza de espécies foi maior em locais com maior cobertura vegetal e 
mata ciliar preservada. 

Palavras-chave: bacia do Rio Paraná, Rio Corumbataí, assembléia de peixes, mata ciliar.

1. Introduction

Riparian forest zones exhibit hydrological, ecologi-
cal and limnological functions important to the biotic and 
abiotic integrity of river systems (Zalewski et al., 2001, 
Barrella et al., 2000). According to these authors, in the 
stretches where the water volume is relatively small, the 
influence of vegetation is large. This is because vegeta-
tion regulates the water flow, provides shelter and or-
ganic matter and substrate for algae and periphyton at-
tachment.

The removal of bank vegetation causes many changes 
in lotic systems, including increased water temperature, 
substitution of a heterotrophic for an autotrophic system 
and the loss of sediment and nutrient retention capacity 
(Angermeier and Karr, 1983; Allan, 1995).

Environmental analyses based on fish assemblage 
have numerous advantages due to the information avail-
able about the life cycles of a large number of species 

and to the inclusion of several feeding habits (omnivores, 
herbivores, insectivores, planktovores, carnivores), al-
lowing the understanding of both the aquatic and ter-
restrial resources. Another advantage is the possibility 
of encountering this group at the top of the food chain, 
which provides an integrated vision of the aquatic envi-
ronment (Harris, 1995).

This study examines if there are associations be-
tween fish species and the state of conservation of the 
riparian forest in the Corumbataí River Basin, in the state 
of São Paulo, Brazil. 

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Description of the study area

The Corumbataí River Basin includes an area of 
approximately 1690 km2 that contains around 13% 

ECOLOGY



Cetra, M. and Petrere Jr., M.

Braz. J. Biol., 67(2): 191-195, 2007192

of the hydrographical basin of the Piracicaba, Jundiaí 
and Capivari rivers, which is a São Paulo State Water 
Resource Management unit. The study area is located 
between the meridians of 47° 30’ and 47° 50’ West and 
the latitudes of 22° 05’ and 22° 30’ South (ATLAS..., 
2002).

The climate is of the Cwa type in the Köppen classi-
fication, which is subtropical, dry in the winter and rainy 
in the summer, with annual mean temperatures varying 
between 20 and 23.7 °C in January and between 14.9 and 
17.1 °C in July (ATLAS..., 2002).

There is currently only 9% of the original vegeta-
tion cover, 6% of which corresponds to riparian for-
est fragments in the Corumbataí River Basin and these 
fragments assume the key role as “biodiversity islands” 
(Viana &amp;amp; Mendes, 1997).

The waters of the Piracicaba River Basin are in a 
critical state, while those of the Corumbataí River Basin 
are of high quality. Despite its being located on the bank 
of the voluminous Piracicaba River, the high quantity of 
chemical residues requires that the city of Piracicaba use 
100% of the water of the Corumbataí system to supply 
its population (ATLAS..., 2002).

Rio Claro is the most important city of the 
Corumbataí Basin with a population of 163,000, which 
represents 79.5% of the total population in this basin. Of 
the total pollution generated in the Corumbataí Basin, 
around 30% is of industrial origin, while 70% comes 
from the sewage systems. Of all of the generated domes-
tic sewage 98% is collected, however, only 5% of that is 
effectively treated. It is estimated that in Rio Claro, 97% 
of the pollution comes from sewage and the other 3% is 
of industrial origin (ATLAS..., 2002). Therefore sewage 
is the main pollutant in the Corumbataí system.

The Ribeirão Claro River shows large anthropic 
alterations, including two dams. The one in the middle 
stretch is used to supply water to the city of Rio Claro. 
Below this dam, untreated sewage is drained into the 
river along a stretch of about 3 km. The other dam is in 
the low stretch, and was previously used for the genera-
tion of energy.

2.2. Fish sampling 

During 2001, 2 collections were performed at 
12 sites: one from March to June and the other between 
September and December. The collections were per-
formed in four of the main rivers of the basin: the Passa 
Cinco, the Cabeça, the Corumbataí and the Ribeirão 
Claro. In each river, three stretches of around 150 m 
were sampled in the downstream direction.

Fishes were sampled with a series of gillnets (3 to 
9 cm mesh, opposite knots) and with 3 pairs of sieves. 
The nets and sieves were placed in the afternoon (be-
tween 15 and 18 hours) and left until the following 
morning (between 7 and 9 hours). Nets were placed and 
distributed along the margins in each point in a random 
way. Pairs of traps were placed in suitable places along 
the channel.

2.3. Habitat elements

The following habitat elements were recorded: the 
order of the rivers (4, 5 and 6); the preservation level 
of the riparian forest: preserved, partially deforested and 
totally deforested; the shade level: 0-25, 26-50, 51-75 
and above 76%; Eucalyptus sp.: presence or absence; 
sugar cane: presence or absence; pastures: presence or 
absence; sewage drainage: presence or absence; the sur-
rounding declivity stability: low or high.

2.4. Data analysis

To analyze the structure of the fish assemblages a 
detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was applied 
(Gauch, 1982). The first two axes of the DCA, and the 
scores of the 35 collected species, were used to visualize 
the data in two dimensions. The weight of the rare spe-
cies was reduced. 

A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied 
to reduce the dimensionality of the data of the habitat 
elements. The number of principal components was de-
termined by the Kaiser-Guttman criterion (components 
with eigenvalue less than one were removed) (McGarigal 
et al., 2000).

A nonparametric analysis of variance was applied 
(Kruskal-Wallis test) for the axes 1 and 2 of the DCA. 
The different rivers were considered as independent 
groups. 

Multiple regression analyses were applied to quan-
tify the relationship between species richness, different 
axes of the PCA and species abundance (number of indi-
viduals) (Marsh-Matthews &amp;amp; Matthews, 2000).

3. Results

The detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) indi-
cated that Astyanax fasciatus (Afas), Pimelodella gracilis 
(Pgra) and Hypostomus regani (Hreg) are associated with 
point 2 of the Corumbataí, just as Triportheus angulatus 
(Tang), Parodon tortuosus (Ptor) and Hyphessobrycon 
eques (Hequ) are associated with site 3 (Figure 1). 
Hoplosternum littorale (Hlit) is associated with point 3 
of the Ribeirão Claro river. Maximum abundance of 
Salminus hilarii (Shil), Prochilodus lineatus (Plin) and 
Leporinus octofasciauts (Loct) was found in points 1 and 
2 of the same river.

The cascudo Hypostomus strigaticeps was frequent-
ly captured in the Corumbataí River Basin, especially 
at points with shade between 0-25% (248 individuals). 
Within the four categories of shade, this species was as-
sociated with points of low shade (X2 = 437.13; df = 3; 
p &amp;lt;0.01).

The principal components analysis (PCA) based on 
the habitat elements data indicates a positive association 
between the first axis with the river order (35.72% of 
explication), the second axis with the vegetative cover 
and the preservation state of the riparian forest (27.96% 
of explication) and an negative association between the 
third axis with pasture presence (12.54% of explication) 
(Table 1).

In the analysis of variance (ANOVA), a signifi-
cant difference was not found between the differ-
ent rivers (axis 1: X2 = 7.308; df = 3; p = 0.063 and  
axis 2: X2 = 5.519; df = 3; p = 0.137).

Species richness was significantly predicted by the 
number of individuals and the scores derived from the 
second principal component (r2 = 0.974; F = 184.98;  
p &amp;lt;0.001) (Table 2 and Figure 2).

4. Discussion

The DCA results indicate a low spatial heterogeneity 
when the primary structure of the fish assemblage (spe-
cies composition and distribution abundance) is consid-
ered (Figure 1). This is supported by the ANOVA, where 
a significant difference was not found between the rivers 
using the scores of the axes 1 and 2 of the DCA. 

These results coincide with those of Toepfer et al. 
(1998), because of the small size of the Corumbataí 
River Basin, which is around 1700 km2. These authors 
state that there exists a smaller assemblage gradient in 
ecoregions, or in this case, in the hydrographic basin, 
than in larger regions, principally because of the high 
mobility of the fish.

The logarithm of the number of individuals was a 
good predictor of species richness (Table 2). This can be 
interpreted as a result of the sample size effect (Connor 
and McCoy, 2001). 

According to classic ecological models like the spe-
cies-area relationship (MacArthur and Wilson, 1967) 
and the river continuum concept (Vannote et al., 1980), 
it is expected that an increase in the number of spe-
cies will be found as the order of the river increases 
(Angermeier and Schlosser, 1989; Osborne and Wiley, 
1992). In accordance with these models, river sections 
near to the headwaters show lower species richness than 
those downstream in the Corumbataí River Basin (Cetra, 
2003). This was found at point 1 of both the Cabeça and 
Corumbataí rivers. 

The preceding descriptive models are insufficient 
to understand the complex landscape of the Corumbataí 
River Basin. It is necessary to consider the relationships 
within the river together with its surroundings because 
the landscape consists of a mosaic made up of small ar-
eas connected by corridors that permit contact between 
the environments.

The results of this work agree with the idea that the 
riparian forests is associated to fish fauna. Although they 
are located in the more elevated river sections, point 1 
of the Passa Cinco and Ribeirão Claro rivers exhibit 
the best conditions in terms of riparian forest conserva-
tion, and more species were captured at these locations  
(Figure 2). 

This situation can be explained through the environ-
mental characteristics of these points. The first site of the 
Passa Cinco River is characterized by a typical “cuesta” 
relief with rocky outcrops and steep but stable run-off 
trenches. The marginal vegetation is responsible for  
51-75% shading, with partial deforestation, thin trees, 
bushes and herbs and some areas covered by grasses. 
The river bed is rocky and graveled with a small amount 
of sand. A large quantity of habitats occur, amongst them 
pools, runs and riffles. This point is frequented by sport 
fishermen seeking lambaris Astyanax spp. 

At the first site of the Ribeirão Claro River, 16 spe-
cies and 39 individuals were captured, which could be 
considered outliers in the relation of species richness to 
abundance. This can be explained by the environmen-
tal characteristics of this point: a lightly undulated relief 
with planar areas, a steep and stable river bank, flooded 
areas and conserved riparian vegetation, with shading 
above 75%. The presence of tabaranas Salminus hilarii 
at this point (Figure 1), a predator population, suggests 
the biological integrity of this location. This indicates 
the high diversity of other species in this area, due to 
the high degree of the environmental selectivity of this 
species and its position in the food chain (Alves and 
Pompeu, 2001).

The low richness of point 3 of the Ribeirão Claro 
River may be a function of the intense anthropic ac-
tions. It is located 1 km above the confluence with the 
Corumbataí River, which theoretically indicates the 

possibility of high species richness. But, its location up-
stream from the second dam and downstream from the 
untreated Rio Claro sewage outlet contributes to a most-
ly organic river bed. In addition, the marginal vegetation 
is made up of pasture grasses, vines and Eucalyptus sp., 
providing 0 to 25% shading. The aquatic vegetation con-
sists of floating macrophytes and grasses. Eighteen indi-
viduals of caborja Hoplosternum littorale were collected 
at this point from September to December. The occur-
rence of this species is explained by its ability to cease 
feeding and use its intestine strictly for aerial breathing 
(Signorini,1999).

Like Power (1984), the data of this study suggest an 
association between a low shade level and the cascudos 
Hypostomus strigaticeps. Hahn et al. (1997) classify it 
as a detritivore, having identified various generas of dia-
toms, filamentous algae, insect larvae (Chironomidae) 
and Nematoda in its stomach, which confirms that these 
fish are important controllers of alga populations. This 
data also indicates that with low levels of shade, these 
sites become autotrophic (Angermeier and Karr, 1983; 
Allan, 1995), creating more food for this species. 

The interpretation of these results cannot be ignored. 
It demonstrates that intense anthropic action has caused 
the elimination of natural heterogeneity, the presence 
of which would have theoretically supported greater 
biological and environmental diversity (Magurran, 2004; 
Begon et al., 1996).
