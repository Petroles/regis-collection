Introduction 

 

Systematic history of Loricariidae with emphases in Hypostominae and 

Hypoptopomatinae 

Loricariidae is a Neotropical freshwater fish familie of Siluriformes widespread 

distributed throughout most of the Neotropics, extending from Costa Rica in the north 

to Argentina in the south. Currently represent roughly 920 valid species (Eschmeyer &amp;amp; 

Fong, 2016) distributed in five subfamilies: Hypostominae, Loricariinae, 

Hypoptopomatinae, Delturinae and Rinelepinae (sensu Lujan et al, 2015). The 

Loricariidae familie have a long and complex systematic history, with morphological 

and molecular studies (Eigenmann and Eigenmann, 1890; Regan, 1904; Gosline, 1945, 

1947; Isbrucker, 1980; Howes, 1983, Schaefer, 1987; Montoya-Burgos et al, 1998, 

2002; Montoya-Burgos, 2003; Armbruster, 2004; Chiachio et al, 2008; Cramer et al, 

2011; Covain and Fisch-Muller, 2012, Roxo et al, 2012, Roxo et al., 2014; and Lujan et 

al.,2015). However the historical evolutionary, and mechanisms that lead to 

diversification are poorly understood in Loricariids.   

The systematics of Loricariidae started to be highlighted with works of 

Eigenmann and Eigenmann (1980) who divided the familiy in three subfamilies: 

Loricariinae, Hypoptopomatinae and Plecostominae. After Eigenmann &amp;amp; Eigenmann 

(1980), Regan (1904) divided Loricariidae in five subfamilies Argiinae, 

Hypoptopomatinae, Loricariinae, Neoplecostominae and Plecostominae, and Gosline 

(1945, 1947) recognized five subfamilies: Plecostominae, Hypoptopomatinae, 

Loricariinae, Astroblepinae (Argiinae) and Neoplecostominae. 

Isbrucker (1980) in a revisionary study, considered six subfamilies: Loricariinae, 

Hypoptopomatinae, Neoplecostominae, Hypostominae, Ancistrinae and Lithogeninae. 

However, Howes (1983) was the first author to perform the cladistic analyses within 



2 

 

Loricariidae, and found six subfamilies: Loricariinae, Hypoptopomatinae, 

Hypostominae, Neoplecostominae, Lithogeninae and Chaetostominae. Schaefer (1987) 

also studies the family using cladistic methods and recognized six subfamilies in 

Loricariidae: Lithogeninae, Neoplecostominae, Hypoptopomatinae, Loricariinae, 

Ancistrinae and Hypostominae. 

Schaefer (1991, 1998) based in morphological characters, presented a 

phylogenetic analysis in subfamily Hypoptopomatinae, provided phylogenetic diagnosis 

for included genera plus an undescribed genus from Venezuela, described as 

Niobichthys (Schaefer and Provenzano, 1998). The study of Schaefer (1991) was based 

in 55 osteological and myological features used to construct a phylogenetic analysis of 

subfamily Hypoptopomatinae (genera Acestridium, Hypoptopoma, Microlepdogaster, 

Otocinclus, Othothyris, Oxyropsis, Parotocinclus, Pseudotothyris, Schizolecis, and a 

new genus from Venezuela). This study found the genus Otocinclus paraphyletic since 

the type species Otocinclus vestitus are more closely related to others 

Hypoptopomatinae than to other Otocinclus species. Additionally, Schaefer (1991), 

created the tribe Otothyrinae to include the genera Otothyris, Pseudotothyris, 

Parotocinclus, Schizolecis and Pseudotocinclus. Schaefer (1998) prompted a re-

evalution of the phylogeny and classification of schaefer (1991) with the inclusion of 

six new genera. The phylogeny is based in 46 morphological characters and species 17 

genera of Hypoptopomatinae. The classification remain the same of Schaefer (1991), 

except for the inclusion of Microlepdogaster  in the ter group Otothyrinae. Nannoptoma 

is the sister group of Hypoptopoma, and Nioblichthys is the sister group of the all 

Hypoptopomatini, except Otocinclus. Whithin Otothyrini the new taxon 3 from 

Tocantins and Xingu basin are sister-group of all others members of the tribe. 

Microlepdogaster was sister group of the clade composed of the genera Schizolecis, 



3 

 

Pseudotothyris and Otothyris, and Eurychelichthys was sister group of new taxon 2 

from Coastal rivers of Sergipe state.  

Montoya-Burgos et al. (1998) performed the first molecular phylogenetic study 

of the family Loricariidae. This study was based in partial sequences of 12S and 16S 

rRNA genes. The results suggested that the subfamilies recognized previously by 

Isbrücker (1980) and Schaefer (1987) did not form monophyletic groups, the species 

Pareiorhina sp., Kronicthys sp., Hypostominae unidentified Hemipsilichthys splendens, 

Hemipsilichthys sp., and Isbrueckerichthys duseni, before placed in Hypostominae were 

close related with Hypoptopomatinae species and Neoplecostomus sp.  

Armbruster (2004) presented a hypothesis of loricariids interrelationship, 

emphasizing the subfamilies Hypostominae and Ancistrinae, based on external 

morphology, osteology and digestive tract anatomy. The old Subfamily Ancistrinae was 

recognized as the tribe Ancistrini, Hypostomini was revalidated, and three new tribes 

were created (Corimbophanini, Rhinelepini, and Pterigoplichthini). Armbruster (2004) 

also recognized the monophyly of the subfamily Loricariinae, sister group of 

Hypostominae, the genus Isbrueckerichthys, Kronichthys and Pareiorhina appeared 

more related to Neoplecostominae than Hypostominae.  

Chiachio et al. (2008), in a molecular study of Hypoptopomatinae foud that the 

Hypoptopomatinae (sensu Schaefer et al. 1998) was not monophyletic and proposed the 

recognition of three monophyletic lineages named Hypoptopomatinae (former tribe 

Hyptopomatini), Otothyrinae (former tribe Otothyrinae) and Neoplecostominae, 

including the genus Pseudotocinclus. The close relationship between Pseudotocinclus 

and Pareiorhina was previously recognized by Montoya-Burgos (1998) and posterior 

works of Cramer et al. (2008, 2011) and Roxo et al. (2012). In the results of Chiachio et 

al. (2008) the new subfamily Otothyrinae forms is sister group with Neoplecostominae 



4 

 

and both subfamilies sister group of Hypoptopomatinae. Otothyrinae forms is sister 

group with Neoplecostominae and both subfamilies sister group of Hypoptopomatinae. 

Otothyrinae is composed for the genera Hisonotus, Corumbataia, Schizolecis, 

Pseudotothyris, Microlepdogaster, Otothyropsis, Otothyris, Parotocinclus, 

Eurychelichthys and Epactionotus, and Hypoptopomatinae for the Otocinclus, 

Lampiella, Macrotocinclus, Hypoptopoma, Nannoptopoma, Oxyropsis and Acestridium. 

Within Otothyrinae the genus Hisonotus was not found as monophyletic, since there 

was species related with Corumbataia, others with Epactionotus and others with 

Eurycheilichthys. 

Roxo et al. (2012) performed a molecular phylogeny of the subfamily 

Neoplecostominae using a multiple approach a maximum parsimony, maximum 

likelihood and a bayesian methods. Their results showed that the subfamily 

Neoplecostominae is monophyletic including Pseudotocinclus, and three clades were 

recognized. The first one is composed of Pareiorhina rudolphi the type species of the 

genus, P. cf. rudolphi and Pseudotocinclus.  The second is composed of  

Isbrueckerichthys, Pareiorhaphis, kronichthys and Neoplecostomus ribeirensis. The 

third is composed of the species of the genera Neoplecostomus, except N. ribeirensis, 

Pareiorhina carrancas, P. cf. carrancas, Pareiorhina sp.1 and an undescribed taxon 

referred as New genus 2.  

Covain and Fisch-muller (2012) in a molecular phylogenetic study suggested the 

paraphyly of Pseudancistrus, presenting five independent lineages within the 

Pseudancistrus. Close related with the Pseudancistrus barbatus (type species of 

Pseudancistrus) were the true Pseudancistrus. Other two lineages comprise 

Guyanancistrus and Lithoxancistrus that were resurrected. The clades formed by 

Pseudancistrus pectegenitor plus P. sidereus and P. orinoco represent genera not 



5 

 

described yet. Silva et al (2013) with a description of a new Pseudancistrus (P. 

zawadzkii) and its phylogenetic position, using molecular data confirmed the results 

found by Covain and Fisch-Muller (2012) about the paraphyly of Pseudancistrus. 

Roxo et al. (2014) in a molecular phylogenetic study recognized the same three 

subfamily-level found by Chiachio et al. (2008) (Hypoptopomatinae, Otothyrinae and 

Neoplecostominae). Moreover, several genera were not monophyletic groups 

(Hisonotus, Parotocinclus, Neoplecostomus, Pareiorhina). The genera Eurychelichthys, 

Epactionotus and Otothyropsis were closely related with Hisonotus notatus (type 

species of Hisonotus) and in future these genera should be synonymized in Hisonotus. 

Hisonotus insperatus, H. oliveirai, H. piracanjuba, Hisonotus sp.4, Hisonotus paresi 

and Hisonotus sp.5, formed a monophyletic group not related with Hisonotus notatus. In 

Roxo et al (2015) the species of these group was relocated and described in a new 

genus, named Curculionichthys.  

 Lujan et al (2015) in the most extensive work with a molecular phylogeny of the 

Loricariidae with emphases in Hypostominae treated the subfamilies 

Hypoptopomatinae, Neopelcostominae and Otothyrinae as tribes Hypoptopomatini, 

Neoplecostomini and Otorhyrini, within of the subfamilie Hypoptopomatinae. 

Moreover, proposed that the tribe Hypostomini, which has traditionnally been 

recognized as sister to tribe Ancistrini based on morphological data, was nested within 

Ancistrini. Additionaly they recognized seven additional tribe-levels clades: The 

Chaetostoma Clade, the Pseudancistrus Clade, the Lithoxus Clade, the „Pseudancistrus? 

Clade, the Acanthicus Clade, the Hemiancistrus Clade, and Peckoltia Clade. Moreover 

Rinelepini previously recognized as tribe of Hypostominae was suggested as a new 

subfamily within Loricariidae, the Rhinelepinae.

Abstract 

Background: The main objectives of this study are estimate a species-dense, time-

calibrated molecular phylogeny of Hypostominae, a large group of armored catfishes 

that is widely distributed across South America, to place the origin of major clades in 

time and space, and to demonstrate the role of river capture on patterns of 

diversification of these taxa.  

Results: We used Bayesian methods to estimate a time-calibrated phylogeny with 220 

Hypostominae species, using two mitochondrial and four nuclear genes, and used 

parametric biogeographic analyses (DEC and DECj models) to estimate ancestral 

geographic ranges, to infer the colonization routes and distribution of these taxa. 

Hypostominae is composed by ten tribe-level clades, and our time-calibrated phylogeny 

and ancestral-area estimations indicate an origin of Hypostominae during the Middle 

Eocene in the ancestral area corresponding to actual Pacific Coastal Drainages and 

Magdalena Basin, Amazon Basin, Orinoco Basin and Atlantic Guyana drainages. 

Conclusion: The speciation in Hypostominae coincides with important geological 

events in South America. 

Keywords: Diversification, Molecular Phylogeny, DEC model, Headwater capture 

 

Background 

The Neotropical region comprises one of the highest ichthyological diversity on the 

globe [1] with more than 5,600 species, representing about 10% of all vertebrate 

biodiversity according to Vari &amp;amp; Malabarba [2], Lundberg [3] and Reis [4]. This huge 



11 

 

species richness has been the focus of many scientific studies [5,6] regarding to all areas 

of science. However, until the past years, the taxonomy, systematics and historical 

geographic distributions of fishes, mainly the Amazonian species, remains unknown [7]. 

As well as, the main mechanisms responsible to generate this huge diversity and 

influence the distribution of species on earth still remains very poorly known [1].  

In this context, one of the principal process that affect local fish fauna is river 

capture events (also known as stream capture or headwater capture), an important 

landscape-level mechanism that can isolate lineages and promote diversification 

[8,9,10] by changing the connectivity of adjacent river basin [11,12,13,14]. Ribeiro [15] 

described river capture as a complex process associated with the ancient faults systems, 

which are more susceptible to erosion process. In this case, small or sometimes large 

portions of a river are captured (i.e. changes its course direction) to an adjacent drainage 

or river basin. This process was very common during formation of the South America 

hydrographic systems over the last 100 My (million of years) [15, 1]. 

The consequences of river capture events for the local fauna can be profound, 

changing watershed boundaries and allowing previously isolated species to disperse and 

colonize new environments [16,17,18]. Furthermore, with the pools of aquatic species 

in adjacent basins becoming mixed, it can elevate regional levels of species richness [1]. 

However, the repeated separation and merging of stream basins through watershed 

boundaries serves to both split (i.e., vicariance) and join (i.e., geodispersal) species 

populations. Headwater capture enriches faunas at local allowing the mixing of 

previously isolated faunas on either side of a watershed divide, but also isolate 

populations across the new divide basins [19,1]. However, the different ways in which 

head water capture events could affect the evolutionary history in aquatic biota remains 

an open area of research [20,21].  

The origin of the modern Neotropical freshwater fish fauna was influenced by 

tectonic and orogenic events such as the fragmentation of Gondwana and the rise on the 

Andes for a period that comprises part of Mesozoic and the entirely of the Cenozoic 

[22]. In the last 15 to 10 My the western was covered by freshwater Lake Pebas that 

connected to the Paraná basin to the Proto-Amazon basin. The western Amazon 

occupying the lake Pebas was separated from the central and eastern Amazon by the 

Purus arch. The uplift of the Venezuelan Andes and the Vuapes arch between 8 and 5 

Mya (million of years ago) [23,24] resulted in the breach of the Purus Arch and the 

connection of the western Amazon with the central and eastern amazon, a process that 



12 

 

can promote allopatric speciation. At the same time, the reconnection of adjacent basins 

would allow the endemic species to dispersal and colonize new habitats. 

Furthermore, fish species diversity in South America hydrographic systems may 

also be affected by sea level oscillations that have permitted the dispersal among 

adjacent rivers via delta connections in coastal drainages or lead species to local 

extinctions [25,26,27,28,29]. Bloom and Lovejoy [30] predicted that broad areas of 

South America, mainly the Amazon basin, have low elevations (&lt;100 m) and are thus 

likely to be impacted by sea level fluctuations. Montoya-Burgos [31] hypothesized that 

this last process is as a result of climate changes that affected lineages of Hypostomus 

inhabiting Amazon drainages about 5-6 Mya. Moreover, from the Miocene to the 

present, the climate has become frosty and has undergone periodic climatic oscillations 

that were responsible for several marine transgression and regression over South 

America continent and that may have affected local freshwater fish fauna leading them 

to extinction of migration to other areas. Albert and Reis [1] documented several marine 

regressions over the last 100 My (e.g. 76–80, 66–71, 45–50, 35–42, 23–34, 9–12, and 

from 3.5 Mya to the present) that according to Budyko [32], Petit [33], and Rothman 

[34] may be the result of the tilt of the planet?s axis, thermohaline circulation, 

atmospheric CO2 concentration, and the relative position of the continents.  

Hypostominae has been recognized as natural group using morphological [35] and 

molecular data [36,37] (in the last two studies Rinelepini tribe, sensu Armbruster [35], 

shared a new subfamily within Loricariidae). Currently the Hypostominae is composed 

by about 466 species divided in 43 genera [38], widely distributed across the 

Neotropical freshwater rivers. Rheophilic fishes, such as Hypostominae, are specially 

good candidates to biogeography studies associated with stream captures, because 

species movements among drainages and habitats would be expected to be hindered by 

deep, main-channel habitats, and facilitated by river captures or reductions in river base 

level during oceanic low stands [39].  

In the present study, we present a time-calibrated phylogenetic analysis of the 

Hypostominae subfamily with the most species-dense taxon sampling for this group 

using a multilocus approach. We use parametric biogeographic methods to estimate 

ancestral geographic ranges to document historical river-capture events in 

Hypostominae, and understand how this process and climate oscillation over the last 

100 My affected the distribution of species of this subfamily across the main 

hydrographic systems of the South America.

Methods 

Taxon sampling 

Our study includes the most comprehensive sampling of Hypostominae to data with 238 

terminal taxa spanning 220 species in 43 genera (Table 1). To test the monophyly of 

Hypostominae we compiled a broad range of outgroups representing all other 

Loricariidae subfamilies, as well as samples of the families Astroblepidae (Astroblepus 

sp.) and Callichthyidae (Hoplosternum littorale, Corydoras imitator and C. 

oiapoquensis) based on relationships established in previous larger scale phylogenetic 

analyses of both morphological [40,41] and molecular [42] data. Sequences data for 

members of the subfamilies Loricariinae, Hypoptopomatinae and Rhinelepinae were 

obtained from previously published studies [43,44,45,46,47,36].

directly by the author GSCS and Dr. Claudio Henrique Zawadzki, except in the case of 

GenBank identifications, which were not changed. 

 

DNA extraction and sequencing 

Whole genomic DNA was extracted from muscle, fin or liver samples preserved 

in 95% ethanol using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, 

WI). Partial sequences of the genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction 

(primers listed in Table 2). Amplifications were performed in a total volume of 12.5 ?L 

with 1.25 ?L of 10X buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl+15 mM MgCl2), 0.5 ?L dNTPs (200 nM 

of each), 0.5 ?L of each 5 mM primer, 0.05 ?L Platinum® Taq Polymerase (LTI: Life 

Technologies Inc., Carlsbad, CA), 1 ?L template DNA (approximately 12 ng), and 8.7 

?l ddH2O. PCR reactions consisted initial step of 30 s at 95°C,35-45 cycles of 15–30 s 

at 48–58°C and final step of 90 s at 72°C. Nested PCRs were used to amplify the 



14 

 

nuclear marker RTN4; the first amplification was performed using the primers 

Freticul4-D and Freticul4-R with a total volume of 12.5 µL for 30–40 cycles (30 s at 

95°C, 30 s at 48°C and 135 s at 72°C); the second amplification was performed using 

the primers Freticul4 D2 and Freticul4 R2 with a total volume of 12.5 µL for 30–40 

cycles (30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 53–54°C and 135 s at 72°C). All PCR products were first 

visually identified on a 1% agarose gel and then purified using ExoSap-IT® (USB 

Corporation, Cleveland, OH) following manufacturer instructions. Purified PCR 

products were sequenced using the Big Dye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Ready 

Reaction Kit (ABI: Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster, CA), purified again by ethanol 

precipitation and sequenced on a 3130 Genetic Analyser (ABI) in the Instituto de 

Biociências, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Botucatu, São Paulo State. 

Sequence alignment and phylogenetic inference 

Two intronic regions of the RTN4 gene, totalling 63% of total locus length, were 

amplified and sequenced by our primers. All loci, including the entire RTN4 sequence, 

were first aligned using the MUSCLE algorithm (default parameters; [47]) followed by 

visual inspection and correction of the alignment requiring almost no changes in base 

position. The total matrix consisted of 295 individuals with 5,816 base pairs, of which 

53.9% were missing data. To detect potential sequencing errors due to contamination or 

paralogy, alignments for each gene were separately analysed by maximum likelihood 

[48] using the web server RAxML BlackBox [49]. Sequences that resulted in obviously 

misplaced taxa in resulting gene trees were re-sequenced or eliminated from subsequent 

analyses.  

We estimated the index of substitution saturation (Iss) and rates of 

transitions/transversions for each gene separately in DAMBE 5.2.31 [50], as described 

by Xia [51] and Xia and Lemey [52]. Iss was estimated without considering gaps 

because unresolved sites reduce the ability of the method to test for phylogenetic signal.  

Maximum likelihood (ML) analyses [48] were performed using RAxML on the 

CIPRES Science Gateway computing cluster [53]. RAxML implements a fast algorithm 

of heuristic searches using bootstrap (BS) resampling [54]. Support for individual nodes 

were assessed using random start trees, the GTR+G model for all partitions of the 

matrix as recommended by the software PartitionFinder [55], and several independent 

ML tree searches consisting of 1,000 pseudoreplicates each with all other parameters set 

to default values.

Time calibration tree 

The uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock (log-normal) was estimated using 

BEAST 1.7.5. [56]. We used a clade-based approach that included each Hypostominae 

lineage in our analysis. The GTR+G model was used for all partitions. The calibration 

prior was implemented using a log-normal distribution offset to 55 My with a mean and 

standard deviation of 1 for the origin of the genus Corydoras lineage (node including all 

Callichthyidae: Corydoras imitator, C. oiapoquensis and Hoplosternum littorale). The 

oldest known loricarioid fossil, Corydoras revelatus Cockerell [57] was dated by 

Marshall [58] as Paleocene, which we used to assign a 55 My minimum age for the 

family Callichthyidae. We used a birth–death model for speciation likelihood and a 

starting tree obtained from ML. The analysis was run for 10 million generations and 

sampled every 1,000th generation. Stationary and sufficient mixing of parameters (ESS 

&gt; 200) was checked using Tracer v1.5 [59]. A consensus tree was built using 

TreeAnnotator v1.7.5 [60]. 

 

Ancestral area estimation 

Data on the geographic distributions of species in the Hypostominae were taken 

from the original species descriptions and information available from the online Catalog 

of Fishes [38]. To maintain consistency with previous biogeographic analyses of the 

subfamily Hypoptopomatinae (sensu Lujan [36]) by Chiachio [43] and Roxo [45], we 

assigned taxa to geographic areas using the ecoregion classification of Vari [61], which 

was derived from patterns of endemism in the Neotropical endemic characiform family 

Curimatidae. Our samples were drawn from the following seven ecoregions: (A) Pacific 

Coastal Drainages and Magdalena Basin, (B) Amazon Basin, (C) Orinoco Basin, (D) 

Atlantic Coastal Drainages, (E) Atlantic Guyana Drainages, (F) Paraguay, Lower 

Paraná and Uruguay Basin, and (G) Upper Paraná Basin. 

We estimated the likelihood of ancestral range evolution using the Dispersal-

Extinction-Cladogenesis (DEC: Ree and Smith [62]) and “jumping” (DECj: Matzke 

[63]) models of species range evolution. These models are composed of two (DEC) or 

three (DECj) parameters including: 1) dispersal (D), where ancestral ranges expand by 

adding new geographic units, 2) extinction (E), where ancestral ranges are reduced by 

extirpating geographic units, and 3) “jumping” events (j), where j specifies the weight 

of the “jumping” events beyond an ancestral range [64]. The two models of range 

evolution (i.e. DEC and DECj) were implemented in the R package BioGeoBEARS 



16 

 

[65] in two different analytical procedures Lagrange [66] and BayArea-like [64]. The 

global likelihood of the six biogeographic scenarios were compared using the Akaike 

Information Criterion (AIC) [67] (Table S2). The model that obtained the lowest AIC 

values was model 2 with the DEC+J model (M2 – DEC + J), which constrained the 

dispersal rates between adjacent areas at 0.5 and areas separated by one or more 

intercalated areas at 0.0001. 

 

Results 

DNA sequence alignment and substitution rates 

The concatenated alignment of sequence data for 16S rRNA, Cytb, RTN4, Myh6, 

RAG1 and RAG2 genes resulted in a matrix with 5,816 base pairs (bp), which 2,405 bp 

were conserved and 3,411 were variable. We do not found evidences for substantial 

saturation considering that the Iss value was greater than the Iss.c value using the test of 

Xia [51]. The observed transition/transversion ratio was 2.89, with nucleotide 

frequencies of 25.0% for adenine, 25.0% for thymine/uracil, 25.0% for cytosine and 

25.0% for guanine. 

 

Phylogenetic relationships 

Our phylogeny showed strong support for several Hypostominae clades and 

according with previously molecular hypothesis [36, 37]. Within Hypostominae, our 

results supported the monophyly of ten monophyletic clades (Fig. 1): Chaetostoma 

clade (BS = 50); Neblinichthys clade (BS = 82); Ancistrini tribe (BS=75); 

Pseudancistrus clade (BS = 94); Lithoxus clade (BS = 57); Acanthicus clade (BS = 81); 

Hemiancistrus clade (BS = 74); Panaque clade (BS = 96); Hypostomini tribe (BS = 73) 

and Peckoltia clade (BS =&amp;lt;50). However, we found some disagreement as the Panaque 

clade appeared within Hemiancistrus clade in Lujan et al. (2015), and Neblinichthys 

clade, composed by Neblinichthys species plus Paulasquama callis, Lithoxancistrus 

orinoco and L. yekuana appeared within Chaetostoma clade also in Lujan [36].  

 

Relaxed clock of Hypostominae clades and historical biogeography 

The mean substitution rate across all loci estimated using BEAST was 0.00347% 

per My. The better hypothesis of ancestral range estimation of Hypostominae 

phylogeny in the seven biogeographic resulted from values of dispersal rate among 



17 

 

adjacent area of 1.00 and no adjacent area of 1.00E-01, according to AIC scores (Table 

3). 

The origin of Hypostominae was estimated by BEAST to have originated during 

the Eocene about 40.7 Mya (31.1–50.1 Mya 95% HPD; see Fig. 2 for molecular clock 

tree including outgroups) and our hypothesis also suggest that the ancestral lineage of 

this group was widespread through the Region ABCE about 40.7 Mya (31.1-50.1 Mya 

95% HPD(Fig.1) and about 33.4 Mya the ancestor of Hypostominae was extinct from 

region A and C. 

Within Hypostominae, our analysis (Fig. 2, 3, 4, 5) suggest that the ten major 

clades of this subfamily have been originated at: Region B for Chaetostoma clade about 

33.4 Mya (26.0–41.2 Mya 95% HPD), Region E for Neblinichthys clade about 31.0 

Mya (24.0–37.8 Mya 95% HPD), Region B for Ancistrini tribe about 29.6 Mya (23.1–

36.1 Mya 95% HPD), Region E for Pseudancistrus clade about 28.5 Mya (22.0–34.1 

Mya 95% HPD), Region C for Lithoxus clade about 27.1 Mya (21.3–32.7 Mya 95% 

HPD), Region B for Acanthicus clade about 23.7 Mya (mean 18.5–28.7 Mya 95% 

HPD), Region C for Hemiancistrus clade about 21.8 Mya (mean 17.0–27.1 Mya 95% 

HPD), Region C for Panaque clade about 21.1 Mya (mean 16.3–26.4 Mya 95% HPD), 

and Region B for Hypostomini tribe and Peckoltia clade about 18.1 Mya (mean 13.8–

23.5 Mya 95% HPD). 

 

Discussion 

Origin and Diversification of Hypostominae in the Andean and Guyana shield 

Highlands 

We estimated the origin of Hypostominae in the period corresponding to Middle 

Eocene, about 40.7 Mya. In this period the ancestor lineage of Hypostominae was 

widespread in the regions A (Pacific Coastal Drainages and Magdalena Basin), B 

(Amazon Basin), C (Orinoco Basin) and E (Atlantic Guyana drainages), regions that 

corresponded to the “Paleo-Amazon-Orinoco”, a large hydrographic basin extended to 

west of the Purus Arch and rivers draining toward the Andean foreland basin that flows 

to north of the Ocean Caribe [68]. According to Lujan [36] the Hypostominae lineage 

diversified in rivers draining to highlands of the Guyana shield, however our results 

suggested that the ancestral lineage of Hypostominae was widespread distributed across 

the “Paleo-Amazon-Orinoco” basin, and in a subsequent period (33.4 Mya) all 



18 

 

Hypostominae species, except Chaetostoma clade, diversified in a highlands of Guyana 

Shield (see Fig .2), while the Chaetostoma clade diversified in the Andean highlands. 

The ancestor lineage of Hypostominae were probably extinct from region A and C 

about 33.4 Mya, in the same time period in the early Oligocene, large parts of the 

Peruvian and Ecuadorian Andean foreland were occupied by lakes to marginal marine 

waters “Lago Pozo” [14]. The marine Pozo embayment occupied the western part of 

present-day Amazonia [68], and this marine incursion may have caused the extinction 

of ancestral lineage which was in region A and C. The Hypostominae species are 

rheophilic fishes and do not support lentic environments such as lakes and channels of 

large rivers [39]. 

The ancestral lineage of the trans-Andean group composed by Dolichancistrus, 

Cordylancistrus, Leptoancistrus, Andeancistrus and Transancistrus from region A 

(Pacific Coastal drainages and Magdalena basin) is the sister group of the ancestral 

lineage of the cis-Andean group composed by Chaetostoma, Lipopterichthys and 

Loraxichthys (region B). These two groups were separated about 31.1 Mya and the 

trans-Andean ancestor originated in Amazon basin (Region B). Along the phylogeny 

other lineages colonized the Pacific Coastal drainages and Magdalena basin (region A) 

from Amazon basin (region B), such as the ancestor of Hemiancistrus landoni about 

16.8 Mya and ancestor of Ancistrus clementinae about 19.8 Mya. This old separation 

coincides with a mountain uplifted in the Northern Andes mountains (late Oligocene to 

early Miocene approximately about 23 Mya) [28]. Abe [70] found similar value to 

separation of Brycon moorei (Magdalena river) and the others species of Brycon (B. 

orthotaenia, B. amazonicus, B. hilari, B. orbygnianus and B. golding) about 21.3 Mya. 

Furthermore, the second and more intense peaks of northearn Andean mountain 

building occurred from the late middle Miocene (~12 Mya) and early Pliocene (~4.5 

Mya), and could be responsible by separate several lineage of Hypostominae (e.g. - 

Chaetostoma breve about 10.7 Mya; Chaetostoma fischeri about 12.1 Mya; and 

Ancistrus chagresi about 8.3 Mya in the middle of Miocene; and Lasiancistrus 

caucanus about 2.7 Mya; Panaque cochliodon about 5.4 Mya; the ancestral of 

Hypostomus rhantos and H. robini about 6.2 Mya, and Hemiancistrus aspidolepsis 

about 4.9 Mya in the early Pliocene). 

Moreover, apparently Chaetostoma vazquezi and Chaetostoma jegui are the 

unique lineage of Chaetostoma that reached the Orinoco and Amazon basin in Guyana 

shield, all others Chaetostoma are restricted in the highland in Andean mountains. 



19 

 

Armbruster [35] and [69] suggested that these species were derived within 

Chaetostoma, however our data showed that this group diverged in a remote time, about 

17.2 Mya. [36] found that Chaetostoma vazquezi and C. jegui also diverged first than 

other Chaetostoma species. 

 

Orinoco/Amazon basin  

Our results showed that the Hypancistrus genus is composed by two 

monophyletic groups, one from Orinoco basin (i.e. a clade composed of Hypancistrus 

furunculus, H. luanorum, H. contradens, H. debilittera and Micracanthicus vandragti, 

which must be reallocated in the genus Hypancistrus) and other from Amazon basin 

including four possible new species (i.e. a clade composed of Hypancistrus sp. 1, 

Hypancistrus sp. 2, Hypancistrus sp. 3 and Hypancistrus sp. 4). Furthermore, our time 

calibrated tree suggested that these two groups diverged about 6.6 Mya. This data is in 

accordance with the uplift of the Vaupes Arch (late Miocene) [24].  

The rise of this arch separated the ancient “Paleo-Amazon-Orinoco” river into two 

separate drainages, the Orinoco flowing to the northeast, and the Amazon flowing to the 

east once it had breached the Purus Arch [70]. Moreover, several others ancestral 

lineages of Hypostominae colonized the Orinoco basin from East Amazon basin 

approximately in the same time, e.g. - Leporacanthicus triactis (8.1 Mya); 

Aphanotorulus ammophilus (6.9 Mya); Hypostomus plecostomoides (5.9 Mya), 

Lasiancistrus tentaculatus (6.9 Mya); Peckoltia vittata (6.3 Mya), and Panaqolus 

maccus (4.9 Mya). These data are similar to those found by previous published works, 

as the separation of populations of Hoplosternum littorale about 11.7 to 6.0 Mya [71], 

the separation of Triportheus orinocensis from ancestral lineage of T. venezuelensis, T. 

signatus, Triportheus sp.n, T. trifurcatus, T. angulatus and T. pantanensis about 6.8 

Mya [72], and the separation of ancestor of Brycon falcatus (Orinoco river) from B. 

falcatus (Negro river) about 4.4 Mya [71]. 

Moreover, in a more recent period of time several ancestor lineage of 

Hypostominae dispersed to Orinoco basin from Amazon drainages, as Ancistrus 

macrophtalmus (2.8 Mya), Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps (4.3 Mya), Peckoltia sabaji (0.6 

Mya), Peckoltia lineola and Peckoltia caenosa (3.3 Mya). These data are consistent 

with to those found in the separation of T. brachipomus (Negro river) and T. 

brachipomus (Orinoco river) about 3.6 Mya [72], the separation of Brycon falcatus 

ancestor (Orinoco river) about 3.9 Mya [73], and the separation of T. argenteus ancestor 



20 

 

(Orinoco river) and the lineage ancestral of T. argenteus from Paraguay, Parnaíba and 

Amazon basin about 5.5 Mya [72].  

 

Southern Guiana shield/Northern Brazilian shield  

Several lineages of Hypostominae are distributed in rivers of Guyana shield 

draining to the Atlantic Ocean, and in southern Amazonian drainages to the Brazilian 

shield. In our phylogeny some of these lineages of northern of Guyana shield form a 

sister group with lineages from southern of Amazon basin. For example, Hopliancistrus 

sp. 1 and Hopliancistrus tricornis (Brazilian shield) is sister group of Corymbophanes 

kaieie (Guiana shield) and this separation occurred about 15.7 Mya. In other groups this 

also happens, Pseudancistrus zawadzkii and Pseudancistrus asurini (Brazilian shield) 

separated from Pseudancistrus corantijiniensis lineage (Guiana shield) about 9.1 Mya; 

Spectracanthicus punctatissimus, Spectracanthicus zuanoni, Parancistrus nudiventris, 

Spectracanthicus murinus, Baryancistrus niveatus, Baryancistrus chrysolomus, 

Baryancistrus xanthellus, Baryancistrus sp. 1 and Baryancistrus sp. 2 (Brazilian shield) 

lineages separated from Hemiancistrus medians (Guyana shield) about 18.1 Mya; and 

ancestral lineage of Ancistrus minutus, Ancistrus sp. 6, Ancistrus sp. 7, Ancistrus sp. 8, 

Ancistrus megalostomus, Ancistrus bolivianus, Ancistrus sp. 9, Ancistrus 

macrophtalmus, Ancistrus sp. 10, Ancistrus sp. 11, Ancistrus sp. 12, Ancistrus sp. 13, 

Ancistrus sp. 14, Ancistrus sp. 15 (Brazilian shield) separated from Ancistrus 

leucosticus (Guyana shield) about 11.4 Mya.  

Silva [74] proposed two hypotheses to explain the distribution pattern of 

Pseudancistrus species in Guyana and Brazilian shields. The first hypothesis states that 

the ancestral lineage of the Pseudancistrus was widely distributed through all Guyana 

Shield rivers and Amazon Brazilian shield rivers. The second hypotheses suggest that 

the ancestral lineage of Pseudancistrus should have reached the Northern Brazilian 

shield through the mainstream Amazon river. Our results are in accordance with the first 

hypothesis, whereas all cladogenesis events occurred before the inversion of the 

Amazon river, that happened about 8 Mya [14]. After this inversion, we could not 

identify more dispersions among the Southern of Guiana shield and Northern of 

Brazilian shield (except in some lineage of Peckoltia clade and Hypostomini). Possibly 

the mainstream Amazon river acted as a permeable barrier for endemic taxa on the 

respective Guiana and Brazilian shields [39] preventing that reophilic species of 

Hypostominae reached the Northern Brazilian shield. Before the establishment of the 



21 

 

main strain Amazon river in eastern of South America those region was an upland area 

(Belterra surface) somewhere between the present day areas of Manaus (Purus arch) and 

Óbidos (Monte Alegre Arch) [14] and through headwater capture events can be allowed 

the invasion of Northern Brazilian shield from southern Guiana shield by reophilic 

Hypostominae species. 

 

Modern corridors: Guyana shield 

Pseudancistrus nigrescens is a species found in the Essequibo river (region E), 

while its sister group, Pseudancistrus sp.1 is found in the Branco and Negro rivers 

(region B). These two taxa separated in relative recent time, about 4.9 Mya (see Fig. 2). 

This data is in accordance with headwater capture events that occurred in the highland 

portions of the Proto-Bebrice (Rupunini and Essequibo) in the Amazon system at the 

end of the Pliocene. Other possible cladogenetic event caused by the headwater capture 

in Proto-Berbice basin happened between Chaetostoma vasquezi (Cuara river) and 

Chaetostoma jegui (Uraricoera) separated about 0.7 Mya. The Cuara and Uraricoara 

rivers were connected drainages in headwater of the Proto-Berbice basin [39], and the 

separation between the Orinoco and Rio Branco basin in recent time also should be 

separated these two lineages.  

Pseudacanthicus leopardus from Takutu river (region B) and Pseudacanthicus 

leopardus from Essequibo river (region E) separated at 0.5 Mya. Our data suggest that 

this dispersion can be occurred through of the Rupununi Portal. The Rupunini Savanna 

floods seasonally, creating a lentic corridor between the Essequibo and Takutu rivers. 

Loricariids of the Essequibo are nearly identical to those of the Takutu, indicating either 

regular, recent dispersal across the flooded savanna or insufficient time for 

differentiation since stream capture [39]. 

We analyzed three samples of Guyanancistrus brevispinis from Nickerie, Moroni 

(both from Atlantic Coastal rivers) and Jari rivers (a south-flowing tributary of the 

Amazon). Our results suggested that G. brevispinnis invaded the Amazon basin (region 

B) from Atlantic Coastal river (region E) about 3.9 Mya, a recent dispersal through 

headwater capture in a Southern Guiana Shield connection [39].Cardoso and Montoya 

[75] suggested that G. brevispinnis arise in Amazon basin and recently invaded the 

Atlantic Coastal rivers, however our results suggest that G. brevispinnis invaded the 

Amazon basin from Atlantic Coastal rivers and not the opposite. 

 



22 

 

Southern invasion 

The ancestral lineage of Ancistrus cuiabe and Ancistrus multipinnis reached the 

Region F (Paraguay and Lower Paraná basin) from Region B (Amazon basin) about 

18.3 Mya. Around the same time the ancestral lineage of Hemiancistrus meizospilos, H. 

maracaiboensis, H. aspidolepis, H. punctulatus, Pterygoplichthys. multiradiatus, P. 

gibbiceps, P. disjunctivus, H. votouro and H. fuliginosus reached the Region F 

(Paraguay and Lower Paraná basin) from Region B (Amazon basin) about 13.4 Mya. 

These two cladogenetic events may be linked to rise of the Chapare Buttress about 30-

20 Mya [14] or to the Michiola Arch about 11.8-10.0 Mya [14]. Abe [71] found similar 

value to separation of Brycon amazonicus and B. hilarii (12.4 Mya) and of B. 

orbygniatus and B. gouldingi (14.4 Mya). More recently others ancestral lineages of 

Hypostominae found the Region F from Region B, such as the ancestral lineage of 

Hypostomus commersoni, H. boulengeri and Hypostomus sp.2 at 4.7 Mya and ancestral 

lineage of Hypostomus cochliodon about 3.3 Mya. These recent headwater captures can 

be explained by reactivation of old faults in this region [76]. 

Our results are in accordance with hypothesis of Pearson [77] that argued a close 

resemblance of the fishes of the Paraguay to the diversified fauna of the Amazon 

indicates their origin from the Amazonia forms. Several works with molecular 

phylogenies has suggested a colonization of Paraguay from Amazon basin 

[31,71,70,77]. Carvalho and Albert [77] also reported almost unidirectional manner of 

fauna dispersal, where the Paraguay basin seems to harbor many groups from the 

amazon basin than the opposite direction. 

The ancestral lineage of Hypostomus affinis, H. piratatu, H. derby and ancestral 

lineage of Hypostomus microstomus colonized the Region F (Paraguay, Lower Paraná 

and Uruguay basin) from region G (Upper Paraná basin) in recent time (3.2 Mya and 

1.6 Mya respectively). Montoya-Burgos [31] pointed that the estuarine connection as in 

delta of Rio la Plata, due to low sea-level may explain more recent divergence time 

among Uruguayan species and their closest Paraná system clades. These events of low 

sea-levels occurred at 6-5 Mya [78,79,80], and coincides with the recent split of the 

species cited above. 

Our results showed that the ancestral lineage of Hypostomus reached the Upper 

Paraná basin from Amazon basin at 7.6 Mya. The ancestor of Pterygoplichthys 

multiradiatus also reached the Upper Paraná basin (region G) from Amazon/Paraguay 

basin (region B/F) at 7.7 Mya. These results are in accordance with Silva [81] that 



23 

 

found a similar value to invasion of ancestral lineage of Hypostomus ac the Upper 

Paraná basin at 12.5 Mya. Roxo [45] found that Corumbataia tocantinensis (Amazon 

basin) separated from Corumbataia cuesta (Upper Paraná basin) approximately at 11 

Mya (see Fig. 7) while Silva [82] found that Rhinolekos capetinga (Amazon basin) 

separated from Rhinolekus garavelloi aproximatelly at 7 Mya (see Fig 2) All these 

events suggest intense headwater captures between the Upper Paraná and Amazon basin 

during the late Miocene. 

 

Conclusion 

In summary, our results show that the origin and diversification of Hypostominae was 

close linked to the highlands, several clades originated in the region C (Orinoco basin) 

and region E (Atlantic Guiana drainages) probably in upland of Andean mountain or 

Guiana shield. The rheophilic species were confined to uplands of Pacific Coastal 

drainages and Magdalena basin, Amazon basin, Orinoco basin and Atlantic Guiana 

drainages, while species more tolerant to lowland as Hypostomus, Ancistrus, 

Pterygoplichthys and Hemiancistrus managed reached and diversified in others regions 

such as the Paraguay, Lower Paraná, Uruguay (region F), Upper Paraná (region G) and 

Atlantic Coastal Drainages (region D).

Abstract 

Identifying habitat characteristics that accelerate organismal evolution is essential to 

understanding both the origins of life on Earth and the ecosystem properties that are 

most critical to maintaining life into the future. Searching for these characteristics on a 

large scale has only recently become possible via advances in phylogenetic 

reconstruction, time-calibration, and comparative analyses. In this study, we combine 

these tools with habitat and phenotype data for 105 species in a clade of Neotropical 

suckermouth catfishes commonly known as cascudinhos. Our goal was to determine 

whether riverine mesohabitats defined by different flow rates (i.e., pools vs. rapids) may 

have affected rates of cascudinho cladogenesis and morphological diversification. In 

contrast to predictions based on general theory related to life in fast-flowing riverine 

habitats, cascudinho lineages associated with these habitats exhibited increased body 

size, head shape diversity, and lineage and phenotype diversification rates. These 

findings are consistent with a growing understanding of river rapids as incubators of 

biological diversification and specialization. They also support ongoing efforts to 

conserve rapids habitats in the face of ongoing hydroelectric powerplant construction 

throughout the major tropical rivers of the world.

Introduction 



52 

 

A growing body of research indicates that colonization of novel habitats can 

dramatically alter rates of evolutionary diversification. Habitat-mediated shifts in rates 

of speciation and morphological diversification have been documented in a wide range 

of organisms. Examples include aquatic amphipods (Hou et al. 2011), dragon lizards 

(Collar et al. 2010), and various fishes (e.g. wrasses, Price et al. 2011; sea catfishes, 

Betancur et al. 2013; pufferfishes, Santini et al. 2013; silversides, Bloom et al. 2013; 

minnows, Hollingsworth et al. 2013). Habitats implicated in these rate shifts span broad 

spatial scales, from biomes (e.g. marine vs. freshwater; Hou et al. 2011; Betancur et al. 

2013; Santini et al. 2013; Bloom et al. 2013) and ecosystems (e.g. open ocean vs. coral 

reefs; Santini et al. 2013), to habitats that are regularly interspersed at relatively small 

spatial scales (e.g., benthic vs. pelagic stream habitats, Hollingsworth et al. 2013; 

arboreal vs. terrestrial habitats, Collar et al. 2010). 

 Natural examples in which clades diversify significantly more quickly or slowly 

after colonizing new environments are rarely observed. These instances are of broad 

significance, though, because they yield insights into both the drivers of evolutionary 

disparity and the fundamental ecological differences between habitats occupied by 

descendent lineages. Habitats that are novel to an evolutionary lineage and correlate 

with accelerated diversification, for example, may be inferred to have had reduced 

competition and/or greater ecological opportunity than the lineage?s ancestral habitats at 

the time of colonization (Hou et al. 2011; Betancur et al. 2013; Bloom et al. 2013). 

Conversely, habitats that correlate with reduced diversification may be inferred to have 

had ecological niches that were already saturated at the time of colonization (ibid.).  

The robustness of such ecological inferences depends on both the number of parallel 

habitat transitions within a given lineage, and the degree to which the historical 

ecological state of each habitat can be corroborated by additional data (e.g. modern 



53 

 

species richness; Betancur et al. 2013). Although the competitive context and resource 

diversity of a habitat are the principal or only driving factors invoked by many studies 

of habitat-mediated evolutionary rate shifts, other possible drivers of diversification 

include habitat patchiness and connectivity over various spatial scales (Losos &amp;amp; 

Ricklefs 2009; Brown et al. 2013), and the complexity and selective strength of 

alternative adaptive landscapes (Rieseberg et al. 2002; Wellborn &amp;amp; Broughton 2008; 

Gavrilets &amp;amp; Losos 2009). Moreover, different lineages at different times can exhibit 

different evolutionary responses to transitions among habitats, yielding alternative 

inferences about the competitive context and ecological opportunities of those habitats 

(e.g. freshwater vs. marine ecosystems, Hou et al. 2011; Betancur et al. 2013; Santini et 

al. 2013; Bloom et al. 2013). Thus, ambiguity regarding mechanisms, as well as 

stochastic effects (Losos 2010) can inhibit robust generalizations about a habitat?s 

influence on lineage diversification.  

Despite these caveats, studies of habitat-mediated evolutionary rate shifts 

provide valuable historical tests of eco-evolutionary hypotheses. Such examples are 

becoming increasingly difficult to test in modern settings as habitats become globally 

more degraded. As human impacts rise, and as conservationists increasingly rely on 

phylogenetic patterns to prioritize habitat protections (López-Osorio &amp;amp; Miranda-

Esquivel 2010), historical comparative analyses grow more important to a wider range 

of audiences. In this study, we examine the differential effects of water velocity on rates 

of diversification in a clade of Neotropical river fishes commonly known as 

cascudinhos (Loricariidae: Hypoptopomatinae), which vary in their preference for fast- 

vs. slow-flowing riverine habitats. 

Fast-flowing waters in streams and rivers exhibit phylogenetically diverse fish 

assemblages with remarkable morphological convergences on a similar array of 



54 

 

phenotypic specializations, such as dorsoventral depression, attachment organs, surface-

scraping jaws (Conway et al. 2012; Lujan &amp;amp; Conway 2015). Unfortunately, fast-

flowing aquatic habitats and their resident biotas are also increasingly threatened 

worldwide by hydroelectric dams and other human impacts (Anderson &amp;amp; Maldonado-

Ocampo 2011; Lujan &amp;amp; Conway 2015). In the Amazon alone, over 400 hydroelectric 

dams are now operational or under construction and over 300 more are planned 

(Winemiller et al. 2016), with a majority of these targeting high-gradient river habitats. 

Large tropical rapids habitats supporting exceptionally diverse, specialized and endemic 

fish assemblages are being especially impacted (Roberts 1993; Sabaj-Pérez 2015). 

There is therefore an urgent need to better understand the distinctive contribution that 

river rapids make to Earth?s biological diversification. 

Although morphological convergence clearly illustrates the evolutionary 

specializations that frequently occur in rapids habitats (Lujan &amp;amp; Conway 2015), the 

large-scale effect that these habitats can have on evolutionary diversification, 

particularly compared with adjacent slower-flowing habitats, remains poorly known. 

We hypothesize that, because of the apparently similar and strong selection pressures 

that drive morphological convergence in rapids habitats, lineages specializing in these 

habitats would exhibit a reduction in both overall morphological diversity and 

diversification rates. In contrast, the deeper, more three-dimensional and complexly-

structured habitat of slow-flowing habitats should correlate with higher overall 

morphological diversity (e.g. Montaña &amp;amp; Winemiller 2010) and diversification rates. 

Swiftly-flowing lotic riverine habitats are also associated with smaller body 

sizes (Schlosser 1987; Lavin &amp;amp; McPhail 1993; Lujan &amp;amp; Conway 2015) and greater 

philopatry (i.e., smaller geographic range sizes) in fishes – the latter putatively because 

of the greater risk that long-distance movement might lead to dislodgement and 



55 

 

exportation from a fast-flowing environment (Markert et al. 2010). Smaller body sizes 

and geographic range sizes are also both expected to correlate with increased rates of 

speciation (Markert et al. 2010; Wollenberg et al. 2011; Albert &amp;amp; Johnson 2012). We 

test these hypotheses by generating a densely sampled, time-calibrated molecular 

phylogeny for the cascudinho subfamily Hypoptopomatinae, which comprises three 

strongly monophyletic tribes that vary in habitat preference: the riffle- and pool-

dwelling Hypoptopomatini and Otothyrini, and the rapids-dwelling Neoplecostomini 

(Roxo et al. 2014). We then use this phylogeny in combination with habitat and 

phenotype data to test for correlation between a lineage?s occupation of fast- vs. slow-

flowing habitats and its rates of speciation and diversification in head shape and 

maximum body size (MBS). 

 

Material and Methods 

Taxon sampling and phylogenetic inference 

All comparative analyses were performed using the time-calibrated phylogenetic 

hypothesis of Roxo et al. (2014). This phylogeny was inferred from partial DNA 

sequences of three mitochondrial loci (16S rRNA, COI, Cytb) and one nuclear locus (F-

reticulon 4; 4,500 base pairs total), and included 105 species representing approximately 

50% of all Hypoptopomatinae species, with every tribe, genus and major lineage 

represented by at least one species (see Table S1 for identities, localities and catalog 

numbers of all tissue vouchers). Throughout this paper, we follow the taxonomic 

scheme of Lujan et al. (2015) in which Hypoptopomatinae is a monophyletic subfamily 

containing the respectively monophyletic tribes Hypoptopomatini, Otothyrini, and 

Neoplecostomini (vs. the Roxo et al. 2014 taxonomic framework in which these last 

three clades were treated as subfamilies). 



56 

 

 

Time calibration 

We calibrated the phylogeny of Roxo et al. (2014) using an uncorrelated relaxed 

molecular clock in the program BEAST v1.6.2 (Drummond &amp;amp; Rambaut 2007). 

Partitioning scheme and nucleotide substitution models for our BEAST analysis were 

determined using the software PartitionFinder v1.1.1 (Lanfear et al. 2012; Tables S3 

and S4 in Roxo et al. 2014). Two fossil calibrations were used to constrain divergence 

times for all clades of the phylogenetic tree: The first calibration was implemented as a 

normally distributed prior offset to 125 million years ago (Mya) with a standard 

deviation of 15 My, which matches current estimates of a Lower Cretaceous (145–100 

Mya) origin of the catfish order Siluriformes (Lundberg 1993; Sullivan et al. 2006; 

Lundberg et al. 2007). We used a birth–death model for speciation likelihood, which 

specifically models extinction throughout the phylogeny, and used a starting tree 

optimized according to maximum likelihood (ML). The BEAST analysis was run for 

100 million generations with tree space sampled every 1,000th generation. Stationarity 

and sufficient mixing of parameters (ESS&gt;200) were evaluated using Tracer v1.5 

(Rambaut &amp;amp; Drummond 2007a), and a consensus tree was assembled using 

TreeAnnotator v1.6.2 (Rambaut &amp;amp; Drummond 2007b). 

 

Ancestral habitat estimation 

Habitat data were obtained from original descriptions of each species included in our 

analysis and from the personal field experience of the authors FFR and VAT, who 

collectedmost of the specimens examined in this study (Table S2). We estimated 

historical rates of habitat evolution using the make.simmap function in the R package 

phytools v0.3-10 (Revell 2012) and the software SIMMAP v1.5 (Bollback 2006). For 



57 

 

the SIMMAP analysis, we generated a presence/absence matrix consisting of all species 

assigned to one or more of four habitat types: rapids, lakes, pools, and riffles 

(classifications follow Crampton 2011). The resulting matrix was run through 1,000 

stochastic character map simulations. We also evaluated the fit of equal-rates (ER), 

symmetric (SYM), all-rates-different (ARD), and meristic macroevolutionary models to 

our data using the fitDiscrete function for discrete data in the R package geiger (Harmon 

et al. 2008), which ranks models according to the Akaike information criterion (AICc; 

Sugihara 1978).  

 

Testing effect of habitat on speciation rate 

We examined the effect of each habitat category on the speciation rate of each 

Hypoptopomatinae tribe using the implementations BiSSE (Binary State Speciation and 

Extinction; Maddison 2007) and MuSSE (Multi-State Speciation and Extinction; 

FitzJohn 2012) in the R package diversitree v0.9-8 (FitzJohn 2012). BiSSE was used to 

test the effect of each habitat individually while MuSSE was used to test the effect of all 

habitat categories combined.  

 

Speciation rate estimation 

To minimize incomplete sampling biases, we accounted for all known missing species 

in all speciation analyses (see Table S2 for a list of missing species and their lineage 

assignments). To estimate rates of speciation and extinction across the subfamily 

Hypoptopomatinae, we used BAMM v2.1.0 (Rabosky 2014). BAMM assumes that 

speciation and extinction are heterogeneously distributed throughout a phylogeny and 

uses a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to explore the universe of 

candidate cladogenesis models (Rabosky et al. 2013; Rabosky 2014; Rabosky et al. 



58 

 

2014a). The analysis was conducted with two chains running simultaneously for a total 

of five million generations. We sampled tree space every 1,000th generation and 

checked for MCMC convergence by plotting the log-likelihood trace using the R 

package BAMMtools (Rabosky et al. 2014b), with burnin set to 0.5 (i.e. first half of all 

samples discarded). To account for the effects of phylogenetic uncertainty on our 

analyses, we conducted BAMM analyses of species diversification across 2,500 trees 

sampled from the posterior distribution of topologies and branch lengths. To visualize 

the evolutionary rate dynamics from BAMM output results we also used BAMMtools.  

 To specifically test the hypothesis that Neoplecostomini underwent an increase 

in speciation rate relative to other Hypoptopomatinae lineages, we used the MEDUSA 

implementation (Alfaro et al. 2009) in the R package Geiger (Harmon et al. 2008). For 

this analysis, the entire Hypoptopomatinae phylogeny was divided into 24 lineages to 

which a total number of species for each lineage (including missing species) were 

assigned. 

 

Morphometric data selection, collection and size correction 

Both body size and head shape are important correlates of trophic ecological, 

locomotory and life history characteristics in fishes (Winemiller et al. 1995; López-

Fernández et al. 2013; Steele &amp;amp; López-Fernández 2014). We therefore measured 

variation in these traits among Hypoptopomatinae species to provide a morphological 

index from which to infer ecological diversity. 

Maximum standard length (SL in cm) is a useful estimate of body size and 

associated life-history traits in most fish species (Albert &amp;amp; Johnson 2012).  Maximum 

standard lengths (or maximum body size: MBS) were compiled for all species from 

original species descriptions, the Check List of the Freshwater Fishes of South and 



59 

 

Central America (Reis et al. 2003), and validated museum records (Table S2). To 

quantify head shape, we made 14 point-to-point measurements between external, 

putatively homologous landmarks using a digital caliper. A total of 291 specimens from 

105 species and 22 genera distributed throughout Hypoptopomatinae were measured 

(Table S4). Landmarks and interlandmark distances were a subsample of those 

originally proposed by Armbruster (2003), and were only measured from adult 

specimens (&gt;18.0 mm SL for Otothyrini, &gt;30 mm SL for Hypoptopomatini, and &gt;50 

mm SL for Neoplecostomini).  

 To minimize allometric (body size) influence on morphometric data, we 

followed the method of Dryden &amp;amp; Mardia (1998) by using the program Past v1.28 

(Hammer et al. 2004) to conduct a principal component analysis (PCA), normalize the 

first two coordinate dimensions, divide all coordinate values by the centroid size for 

each specimen and conduct a Procrustes superimposition of the left half to a mirrored 

version of the right half. We then used Past to conduct a PCA on the covariance matrix 

of phylogenetically corrected residuals.  

 

Estimating phenotypic diversification rates 

To estimate rates of continuous evolution in body size and head shape, we used BAMM 

v2.1.0 (Rabosky 2014; see BAMM input values in Table S2). BAMM was programmed 

to use two chains running simultaneously for a total of 50 million generations, and to 

sample tree space every 5,000
th
 generation. MCMC convergence was checked by 

plotting the output log-likelihood trace using the R package BAMMtools (Rabosky et 

al. 2014b) with burn-in set to 0.5. Final BAMM analyses of phenotypic evolution 

examined 5,000 trees sampled from the posterior distribution. Evolutionary rate 

dynamics were visualized from BAMM output using BAMMtools. 



60 

 

 

Ancestral body size estimation 

To estimate rates of body size evolution, we used the contMap function in the R 

package phytools v0.3-10 (Revell 2012). This function maps a continuous character on 

to a phylogenetic tree by estimating ancestral states at each nodes using fastAnc (fast 

estimation of ML ancestral states). Macroevolutionary models were evaluated using the 

fitContinuous function in the R package geiger (Harmon et al. 2008), which ranks 

models according to AICc scores. 

 

Phylomorphospace analysis 

To visualize the distribution of modern species and ancestral lineages in morphospace 

(Sidlauskas 2008), we generated phylomorphospace biplots using the 

phylomorphospace function in the R package phytools v0.3-10 (Revell 2012). The first 

principal component of size-corrected head shape for each taxonomic grouping was 

plotted against log maximum body size (MBS). Species were plotted using colors that 

correspond to their habitat classification.  

 

Results 

Time-calibrated phylogenetic analysis 

We obtained a time-calibrated phylogeny that is the most taxonomically comprehensive 

to date for catfishes of the subfamily Hypoptopomatinae (Fig. S1, sensu Lujan et al. 

2015) with a tree topology that parallels earlier studies (i.e. Chiachio et al. 2008; Roxo 

et al. 2014). The subfamily Hypoptopomatinae is estimated to have originated during 

the Paleocene, approximately 58.4 Mya (40.8–79.7 Mya 95% highest posterior density, 

HPD), the tribe Hypoptopomatini and clade composed of Neoplecostomini + Otothyrini 



61 

 

during the Lower Eocene, approximately 49.9 Mya (33.6–67.4 Mya 95% HPD), and the 

tribes Neoplecostomini and Otothyrini during the Lower Eocene, approximately 45.9 

Mya (31.0–62.2 Mya 95% HPD). Mean substitution rate for the entire dataset was 

estimated to be 0.27% substitutions per million years.  

 

Ancestral habitat estimation 

Our SIMMAP analysis indicated that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of 

both the subfamily Hypoptopomatinae and the tribe Otothyrini occupied mostly lake, 

pool and riffle habitats, whereas the Hypoptopomatini MRCA occupied lake and pool 

habitats almost exclusively (Fig. 1). In contrast, the Neoplecostomini MRCA and 

almost all descendent linages were found to have occupied mostly fast-flowing riffle 

and rapids habitats (Fig. 1). The equal-rates (ER) model best fit our habitat data and was 

used in the SIMMAP analysis of habitat (Table 2).  

 

Effect of habitat on speciation rate 

Our MuSSE analysis found that all four habitats had a combined effect on speciation in 

Hypoptopomatinae (Table 3), whereas our separate BiSSE analyses of each habitat 

found that only pool and rapids habitats affected speciation (lake and pool habitats did 

not have an affect).  

 

Speciation rate analyses 

For the subfamily Hypoptopomatinae as a whole, speciation rate increased from the root 

until approximately 40 Mya, then decreased from that time to the present (Fig. 2). 

Within Hypoptopomatinae, our BAMM analysis indicated an overall deceleration in 

speciation rate starting with the most recent common ancestor of the tribes 



62 

 

Hypoptopomatini and Otothyrini, whereas Neoplecostomini exhibited a constant overall 

speciation rate, with a strong increase along the branch leading to the rapids-dwelling 

genus Pareiorhaphis (Fig. 2; Fig. 3a). Speciation rate-through-time dynamics for tribes 

Hypoptopomatini and Otothyrini are also consistent with speciation decreasing from the 

oldest node to the present, whereas Neoplecostomini showed a small increase in 

speciation rate near the present (Fig. 2).  

Our specific test of a speciation rate shift using MEDUSA indicated that 

speciation rate significantly increased along the branch giving rise to the relatively 

large-bodied clade comprising the genera Neoplecostomus, Isbrueckerichthys, 

Kronichthys, Pareiorhaphis and Pareiorhina (Fig. S2).  

 

Rates of diversification in body size and head shape 

Our BAMM analysis indicated an acceleration in the rate of MBS evolution in the 

Neoplecostomini, which was greatest in the genus Pareiorhaphis (Fig. 4). In contrast, 

MBS diversification was relatively constant in the Hypoptopomatini and decelerated in 

the Otothyrini (Fig. 4). We also observed an acceleration in head shape diversification 

along the branch leading to the tribe Neoplecostomini (Fig. 5), and evidence of a shift in 

the rate of head-shape diversification at the node giving rise to Neoplecostomini (Fig. 

5). 

 

Estimating ancestral body size 

Our ContMAP analysis revealed an evolutionary trend toward larger body sizes in the 

Neoplecostomini and an overall decrease in body sizes in Otothyrini (Fig. 1). Some 

clades nested within Neoplecostomini showed very fast rates of evolution to both larger 

(Kronichthys subteres and Pareiorhaphis cameroni) and smaller (K. lacerta and P. 



63 

 

eurycephalus) body sizes. The Kappa model best fit our body size data and was used for 

our ContMAP analysis (Table 1).  

 

Phylomorphospace analysis 

The first principal component (PC1) axis of our phylomorphospace analysis explained 

52.4% of variation in head shape for all Hypoptopomatinae species. Characters that 

loaded strongly on PC1 were head–eye length, orbit diameter, snout length, internares 

width, interorbital width, mouth width, and barbel length (Table S4). Species of the 

highly rheophilic tribe Neoplecostomini occupied a distinct region of head shape/body 

size morphospace (Fig. 6), largely exclusive of the morphospace occupied by slower-

water dwelling members of the Hypoptopomatini and Otothyrini. 

 

 

Discussion 

Our analyses indicate that the most recent common ancestor of the cascudinho catfish 

subfamily Hypoptopomatinae had a relatively small body size (~6 cm SL) and occupied 

riffle and pool habitats approximately 58.4 Mya (40.8–79.7 Mya 95% HPD; Figs. S1 

and 1). The tribes Hypoptopomatini and Otothyrini – two of three major cascudinho 

subclades – remained largely restricted to small body sizes and similar habitats (Fig. 1), 

and exhibited mostly decreasing or constant rates of speciation (Fig. 2) and 

morphological diversification (Figs. 4 and 5). In stark contrast, the primarily riffle- and 

rapids-dwelling tribe Neoplecostomini exhibited constant or increasing rates of 

speciation and morphological diversification, with a significant shift toward faster 

speciation in the lineage leading to exclusively rapids-dwelling species (Fig. S2). With 

maximum body sizes ranging from 3.9 to 17.0 cm SL, modern neoplecostomin species 



64 

 

exhibit ~120% greater size range than the Hypoptopomatini (3.3–14.3 cm SL) and 

~300% greater size range than the Otothyrini (2.1–6.6 cm SL; Table S2). Moreover, 

neoplecostomin species span a broader range of head shape diversity than either of the 

two other clades combined (Fig. 6). Of the four habitat categories occupied by 

cascudinho catfishes, only two – rapids and pools – appear to have significantly 

influenced net speciation rates throughout Hypoptopomatinae (Table 3), with the former 

accelerating and the latter decelerating speciation. 

Ecological opportunity is often invoked to explain accelerations in evolutionary 

diversification following a habitat shift, due to reduced competition associated with the 

availability of more resources in new habitats (Hou et al. 2011; Betancur et al. 2013; 

Bloom et al. 2013). However, the specific role of ecological opportunity is difficult to 

disentangle from other influences associated with habitat shifts. Such influences may 

include reduced dispersal ability, the spatial scale of gene flow, and effective population 

sizes (Losos &amp;amp; Ricklefs 2009; Markert et al. 2010; Brown et al. 2013), or increases in 

the complexity or selective strength of adaptive landscapes (Rieseberg et al. 2002; 

Wellborn &amp;amp; Broughton 2008; Gavrilets &amp;amp; Losos 2009; Lujan &amp;amp; Conway 2015). 

Contrary to the predictions of ecological opportunity, we predicted that rapids-dwelling 

Hypoptopomatinae lineages would exhibit accelerated speciation and decelerated 

morphological diversification. We based these predictions on prior observations or 

inferences of reductions in body size, dispersal ability, and the spatial scale of gene flow 

(Lavin &amp;amp; McPhail 1993; Markert et al. 2010), and morphological trends suggesting 

increased stabilizing selection (Lujan &amp;amp; Conway 2015) in fast- vs. slow-water 

specialized fish lineages.  

Empirical patterns, however, differed from our predictions. As predicted, 

speciation did increase in Neoplecostomini, but this acceleration was accompanied by 



65 

 

larger, not smaller, body sizes. Also, diversification of both body size and head shape 

significantly increased in neoplecostomin lineages occupying rapids habitats 

exclusively. These differences between predicted and observed patterns highlight major 

gaps in our understanding of the evolutionary influence that rapids habitats can have on 

rheophilic organisms. Questions raised by our study include whether the distinctive and 

diverse head shapes observed in Neoplecostomini correspond to as yet unrecognized 

adaptive ecological peaks – such as distinctive benthic food resources (e.g., Lujan et al. 

2011, 2012) – that might only be present in rapids habitats. If this were known, and 

these niches were underexploited prior to the neoplecostomin invasion of these habitats, 

then the otherwise poorly supported hypothesis of ecological opportunity would become 

increasingly plausible. Likewise, it would be valuable to know if the distinctive 

hydrodynamic environment of rapids habitats selects for a narrow range of optimal 

body sizes. If such a size optimum were larger than the Hypoptopomatinae ancestor, but 

smaller than ancestorsof other fish lineages that have shrunk upon invasion of fast-water 

habitats (e.g., Gasterosteidae: Gasterosteus, Lavin &amp;amp; McPhail 1993; Cichlidae: 

Teleocichla, Steele &amp;amp; López-Fernández 2014; Percidae: Etheostomatinae, Stepian &amp;amp; 

Haponski 2015), the ecological process driving divergent body size shifts could be 

understood more clearly.  

Unfortunately, geographic ranges and the spatial scale of gene flow in these 

species and habitats are unknown, making the job of disentangling evolutionary 

mechanisms all the more difficult. Studies of relatively recent, intraspecific 

differentiation between populations or individuals associated with slow- vs. fast-water 

habitats provide strong evidence that the adaptive landscape of these habitats are 

distinct, but applications of these studies to the Hypoptopomatinae system are limited. 

For example, Langerhans et al. (2003) investigated the effects of different flow rates on 



66 

 

body shape in adjacent populations of a mid-water and a near-bottom dwelling fish 

species. They observed shifts toward a more fusiform body, a higher aspect ratio caudal 

fin, and respectively upturned (mid-water species) or downturned (near-bottom species) 

mouths. Likewise, in studies of lake vs. stream populations of three-spine stickleback 

(Gasterosteus aculeatus; Berner et al. 2008; Sharpe et al. 2008), lotic populations were 

found to have deeper bodies and caudal peduncles. In a review of flow regime studies 

on fishes, Langerhans (2008) found that fishes adapted for life in high-flow 

environments share several specialized physiological and biomechanical traits related to 

swimming, including relatively more red muscle, stiffer bodies, higher steady 

swimming performance, and lower unsteady swimming performance.  

Hypoptopomatinae species, however, are entirely benthic, have dorsoventrally 

depressed bodies, entirely ventral mouths and oral disks, and rarely swim freely in the 

water column, preferring instead to make short movements between substrate 

attachment sites (all authors pers. obs.). Indeed, the oral disk of all members of the 

family Loricariidaeseems to facilitate attachment and station-holding in fast-water 

habitats without otherwise specialized body morphologies or enhanced swimming 

performance (Geerinckx et al. 2007). Similar morphological specializations have 

repeatedly evolved in a wide range of other fast-water specialized fish lineages 

throughout the world (Lujan &amp;amp; Conway 2015). 

Despite the elusiveness of a single compelling narrative to explain the observed 

diversification rate shifts in fast- vs. slow-water specialized Hypoptopomatinae 

lineages, results of this study should serve as robust support for the further investigation 

and conservation of riverine rapids habitats. These habitats can be challenging for fishes 

to occupy, and also to investigate from a real-time, ecological perspective because of 

the strong hydraulic forces that define them. Macroevolutionary studies such as this 



67 

 

provide an alternative to working directly in the habitat by focusing instead on 

specimens that have been removed from it. There is an urgent need, however, for 

studies such as this to be complemented with detailed ecological and population genetic 

data so that a more complete understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics in these 

distinctive but threatened ecosystems can be achieved. Given the intensity and global 

scale of especially tropical river development (Winemiller et al. 2016), such data should 

be gathered soon.

Running head: New species of Curculionichthys 

 

Corresponding author: Fábio F. Roxo (roxoff@hotmail.com.br) 

 

Abstract 

We describe a new species of Curculionichthys from northern Brazil. The new species 

is known from the rio Cassiporé, an Atlantic coastal river and an unnamed affluent of 

the rio Jari, left tributary of the Amazon river. It can be distinguished from congeners by 

(1) the irregular concentration of chromatophores that cover the anal-fin origin and 

adjacent region, and distal portions of the first unbranched anal-fin ray, (2) lack of dark-

brown spots scattered over the body, (3) lack of contrasting dark spots over the 

anterodorsal region of the body, (4) presence of papillae randomly distributed across the 

lower lip, (5) small, inconspicuous odontodes that form rows over the head and trunk, 



101 

 

(6) anterior profile of the head pointed, (7) higher number of premaxillary and dentary 

teeth, (8) lack of unpaired platelet on the dorsal portion of caudal peduncle, (9) lower 

number of vertebrae, and (10) higher number of lateral abdomen plates. A discussion on 

the morphological variation of diagnostic features within Curculionichthys is also 

provided.

Introduction 

The Neotropical catfish genus Curculionichthys Roxo, Silva, Ochoa &amp;amp; Oliveira, 2015, 

was recently described in the current tribe Otothyrini (sensu Lujan et al., 2015) based on 

the recognition of a monophyletic assemblage returned from a phylogenetic analysis of 

molecular data (Roxo et al. 2014a). Morphological characters supporting 

Curculionichthys include the (1) presence of a pair of rostral plates at the snout tip, (2) 

two large pre-nasal plates right posterior to the rostral plates, (3) supra-opercular plate 

receiving the laterosensory canal from the compound pterotic before preopercle, (4) a 

well-developed membrane at anal opening in females, and (5) a V-shaped spinelet 

(Roxo et al. 2015). Curculionichthys includes five species previously assigned to 

Hisonotus Eigenmann &amp;amp; Eigenmann, 1889, plus three new species described therein 

(Roxo et al. 2015). These are distributed mostly throughout the Brazilian Shield 

drainages: C. insperatus, C. oliveirai and C. piracanjuba in the upper rio Paraná; C. 

coxipone and C. paresi in the upper rio Paraguay; C. sagarana in the rio São Francisco; 

C. luteofrenatus in the upper rio Tapajós; and C. sabaji in the rio Xingu (Roxo et al. 

2015).

Recent expeditions in Amapá and Pará, northern Brazil, particularly in the rio 

Jari and Atlantic coastal versants, have revealed some new records of species for Brazil 

(Melo et al., in press) and also discovered an undescribed species of Curculionichthys 

that is formally described herein. This represents a range extension of the genus to 

northern rivers draining the eastern Guiana Shield. 

 

Material and Methods 

Measurements and counts were taken from the left side of specimens and were made 

from point to point to the nearest 0.01 mm with a digital caliper. Nomenclature of body 

plates and osteology follow Schaefer (1997). Measurements and abbreviation follow 

Carvalho &amp;amp; Reis (2009). Morphometrics are given as percentages of standard length 

(SL), except for subunits of head region expressed as percentages of head length (HL). 

Specimens were cleared and double stained (c&amp;amp;s) according to Taylor &amp;amp; Van Dyke 

(1985). Vertebral counts include the five vertebrae of the Weberian apparatus and the 

compound caudal centrum (PU1+U1) as one element. Counts of dorsal-fin rays include 

the spinelet as the first unbranched ray. Institutional abbreviations follow Fricke &amp;amp; 

Eschmeyer (2015). Specimens are deposited at the Laboratório de Biologia e Genética 

de Peixes, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Botucatu, Brazil (LBP) and Museu de 

Zoologia, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil (MZUSP). Zoological 

nomenclature follows the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (International 

Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, 1999).

females (19.8–21.9 mm SL), 4 males (20.7–22.3 mm SL), same data as holotype. 

Diagnosis. Curculionichthys karipuna differs from all congeners, except C. 

sabaji and C. paresi, by the presence of an irregular concentration of chromatophores 

that entirely cover the anal-fin origin and adjacent region, and distal portions of the first 

unbranched anal-fin ray (Fig. 2a) (vs. absence of such pigmentation pattern, Fig. 2b). 

Curculionichthys karipuna differs from C. sabaji by the absence of dark-brown spots 

scattered over the body (vs. presence); it differs from C. paresi by the lack of 

contrasting dark spots at the anterodorsal region of body (vs. presence of such spots). In 

addition, the new species differs from C. insperatus, C. sabaji, C. paresi and C. 

coxipone by having all papillae randomly distributed throughout lower lip (vs. papillae 

aligned in series that extends from the distal portion of lower lip to dentary); it differs 



104 

 

from C. insperatus and C. oliveirai by the presence of small, inconspicuous odontodes 

forming rows on head and trunk (vs. presence of large, conspicuous odontodes). 

Curculionichthys karipuna differs from C. coxipone and C. oliveirai by having a 

pointed profile of the anterior portion of the head (vs. rounded profile); it differs from C. 

paresi by having 10–16 premaxillary teeth (vs. 6–10) and 10–14 dentary teeth (vs. 4–7); 

it differs from C. sagarana by the absence of an unpaired platelet on dorsal portion of 

caudal peduncle (vs. presence). The new species also differs from C. coxipone by 

having 27–28 vertebrae (vs. 29–30). Finally, C. karipuna differs from C. oliveirai by the 

presence of 7–8 lateral abdomen plates (vs. 4–5).

Sexual dimorphism. Adult males possess a papilla covering urogenital opening, 

a long pelvic fin that extends beyond anal-fin origin, and the unbranched pelvic-fin ray 

supporting a dermal flap along its dorsal surface, features absent in all analyzed 

females. 

Distribution and habitat. Curculionichthys karipuna is known from two 

localities: a small stream of the rio Cassiporé, an Atlantic coastal river of northern 

Amapá and a small stream reaching the rio Jari (Fig. 4). These localities are composed 

of shallow, fast-flowing stream bordered with marginal vegetation (Fig. 5). Portions of 

the stream of rio Cassiporé (Fig. 5a) contain large rocks and do not have preserved 

vegetation resulting in an intense penetration of light. The stream of the rio Jari (Fig. 

5b) is composed of 1-meter deep water in which C. karipuna lives associated to aquatic 

roots stuck on the border. 

Etymology. The specific name “karipuna” is a reference to the Karipuna 

indigenous people that inhabit the region of the Oiapoque river, northern Amapá, Brazil. 

A noun in apposition.  

Remarks. Le Bail et al. (2000) catalogued a “gen. nov. aff. Parotocinclus” in 

the Marowijne river basin. Although that specimen, based on their photography, 

strongly resembles Curculionichthys karipuna, examination of that material is still 

required to confirm the identification. 

Discussion. Curculionichthys karipuna is included within the recently described 

genus Curculionichthys by possessing four of five diagnostic features (see 

Introduction). However, C. karipuna does not possess the well-developed membrane at 

anal opening in females and present variable morphology related to rostral plates in 

some specimens. Yet, one counterstained specimen has a single rostral plate at the snout 

tip (Fig. 3). Curculionichthys insperatus, type species of the genus, similarly presents 



108 

 

intraspecific variability in the rostral plates (see details in Roxo et al. 2014b). Though, 

such character is useful to diagnose Curculionichthys from other Otothyrini genera. In 

addition to the five proposed diagnostic characters for Curculionichthys (Roxo et al. 

2015), we found two additional features related to external morphology that facilitates 

its identification: (1) presence of a dark stripe extending from caudal-peduncle base to 

median caudal-fin rays and (2) absence of hypertrophied odontodes covering snout tip.  

Despite species of Otothyrini present a wide variation in the color pattern of the 

caudal fin, only species of Curculionichthys have a hyaline caudal fin with a dark stripe. 

Curculionichthys insperatus and C. sagarana have a dark stripe that extends to the 

caudal-peduncle base but does not reach median caudal-fin rays, whereas all other 

congeners (including C. karipuna) possess a dark stripe that covers the caudal-peduncle 

base and extends to median caudal-fin rays.  

Schaefer (1998) proposed that the presence of enlarged odontodes covering the 

snout tip can diagnose species of Hisonotus. Recently, Silva et al. (2016) found that 

such character is exclusive to species related to the type species, H. notatus (e.g., H. 

armatus, H. laevior, H. leucofrenatus, H. nigricauda). Conversely, species not related to 

H. notatus, such as H. acuen and H. chromodontus (Roxo et al. 2014a; Silva et al. 

2016) do not present such hypertrophied odontodes. Similarly, species of 

Curculionichthys previously included in Hisonotus (C. insperatus, C. luteofrenatus, C. 

oliveirai, C. paresi and C. piracanjuba) and those recently described (C. coxipone, C. 

sabaji, C. sagarana and also C. karipuna) do not present hypertrophied odontodes, 

which confirms the variable nature of this character within Otothyrini.

Running title: Description of a new catfish genus  

 

Abstract  

Avaichthys canoeiro n. gen. and sp. of Otothyrinae is described from small tributaries 

of the upper rio Tocantins basin. It is distinguished from all other genera of 

Otothyrinae by having three exclusive characters: the pectoral girdle not exposed in 

ventral view, the pectoral fin with seven to eight branched rays, and by having the 

pelvic-fin unbranched ray larger than pectoral-fin unbranched ray in males. 

Furthermore, the new genus differs from all Otothyrinae genera by having the 

following combination of characters: absence of dermal plates on snout tip and by the 

presence of an adipose fin. Maximum likelihood analysis was used to estimate a 

molecular phylogeny from previously published data of one nuclear (F-Reticulon 4) 

and three mitochondrial (16S RNA, COI and CytB) genes. The phylogenetic results 

revealed the new genus and species as a sister taxon of Gymnotocinclus anosteos 

within the Otothyrinae. We also included samples of Nannoplecostomus eleonorae 

that appeared sister group of all other Neoplecostominae species, and Plesioptopoma 

curvidens that appeared within the Neoplecostominae forming a sister clade with all 

species of Neoplecostomus, except N. ribeirensis and the species of Pareiorhina, 

except P. rudolphi.

INTRODUCTION 

The Loricariidae is the largest Neotropical endemic fish family, which actually 

includes 916 species (Eschmeyer &amp;amp; Fong, 2016) distributed in seven subfamilies: 

Delturinae, Hypoptopomatinae, Hypostominae, Lithogeninae, Loricariinae, 

Neoplecostominae, and Otothyrinae (Armbruster, 2004; Reis et al., 2006; Chiachio et 

al., 2008; Roxo et al., 2014). Within Loricariidae the Otothyrinae is a monophyletic 

group including more than 100 species classified in 13 genera: Corumbataia, 

Curculionichthys, Epactionotus, Eurycheilichthys, Gymnotocinclus, Hisonotus, 

Microlepidogaster, Otothyris, Otothyropsis, Parotocinclus, Pseudotothyris, 

Rhinolekos and Schizolecis (Eschmeyer, 2016). These fishes are all small, widely 

distributed throughout South America hydrographic systems from the Guianas to 

Argentina (Schaefer, 2003).  

Reis &amp;amp; Schaefer (1998) suggested that the diversity of Otothyrinae and 

Hypoptopomatinae should be much greater than they had recognized at that time. 

Furthermore, for the last 10 years about 50 species of Otothyrinae and 10 species of 

Hypoptopomatinae has been described (Eschmeyer, 2016), as well as four new 

genera. Reis et al. (2012) described the monotypic genus Plesioptopoma from upper 

rio São Francisco basin as a possible member of the Otothyrinae (recognized as 

Hypoptopomatinae in that study), despite its shares several characters with members 

of Neoplecostominae; Carvalho et al. (2008) described Gymnotocinclus a monotypic 

genus from rio Tocantins basin; Martins &amp;amp; Langeani (2011) erected Rhinolekos to 

accommodate three new species from rio Paranaíba basin; and Roxo et al. (2015) 

described Curculionichthys to reallocate several species previously assigned to 

Hisonotus which were not close related to the type species H. notatus. 

Recently, during a collecting expedition in tributaries of the upper portion of 

rio Tocantins basin we recognized an undescribed genus of Loricariidae that after a 

phylogenetic analysis was assigned to the subfamily Otothyrinae. The present study 

deals with the description of this new genus and species. 

 

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

Morphological analysis 



123 

 

Measurements and counts were taken from the left side of the samples and are shown 

in Table 1. Body plate nomenclature and counts follow Schaefer (1997), and 

measurements follow Armbruster (2003), except for mouth width that was not 

measured. All measurements were taken point to point with digital calipers and were 

rounded to the nearest 0.1 mm. Osteological examination was made on cleared and 

double-stained specimens (c&amp;amp;s) according to the procedures of Taylor &amp;amp; Van Dyke 

(1985). Vertebrae counts included five from the Weberian Apparatus and the 

compound caudal centrum (PU1 + U1) was counted as one element. 

Institutional acronyms follow Fricke &amp;amp; Eschmeyer (2016). Vouchers of all 

samples were deposited in the collection of the (ANSP) Academy of Natural Sciences 

of Drexel University, municipality of Philadelphia, USA; (AUM) Auburn University 

Natural History Museum, municipality of Auburn, USA; (LBP) Laboratório de 

Biologia e Genética de Peixes, municipality of Botucatu, Brazil; (MZUSP) Museu de 

Zoologia da Universidade de São Paulo, municipality of São Paulo, Brazil; and 

(NUP) Núcleo de Pesquisas em Limnologia, Ictiologia e Aquicultura, Universidade 

Estadual de Maringá, municipality of Maringá, Brazil. Zoological nomenclature 

follows the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (International 

Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, 1999).  

 

Principal component analysis (PCA) 

The PCA - Principal Component Analysis was achieved using all measurements to 

check overall variation among males and females according to Jolliffe (2002). PCA 

was performed using covariances of base 10 logarithmically transformed, to reduce 

the influence of size, and were obtained using Past version 1 28 (Hammer et al., 

2001). The PCA Loadings are presented in Table 2. 

 

Phylogenetic analysis - Taxon Sampling 

Species included in the present work were all from Roxo et al. (2014), except for two 

samples of Avaichthys canoeiro, one sample of Gymnotocinclus anosteos, two 

samples of Nannoplecostomus eleonorae, two samples of Plesioptopoma curvidens, 

one sample of Pareiorhina pelicicei, one sample of Pareiorhina cepta, one of 

Pareiorhina brachyrhyncha, one of Pareiorhina sp. 1, one of Microlepidogaster 

arachas, one of Microlepidogaster longicolla, one of Microlepidogaster sp. 1, and 

one of Microlepidogaster sp. 2. It is worthy to note that our molecular character 



124 

 

matrix represents 116 loricariid species (see Table S1 for all taxa). Diplomystes 

mesembrinus (Diplomystidae) was used as outgroup to root our phylogeny (Arratia, 

1987; de Pinna, 1993, 1998; Grande, 1987; Grande &amp;amp; de Pinna, 1998; Mo, 1991; 

Sullivan et al., 2006). Additionally, samples of Corydoras imitator, Corydoras 

oiapoquensis, Hoplosternum littorale, Callichthys callichthys (Callichthyidae), 

Astroblepus sp. 1 and Astroblepus sp. 2 (Astroblepidae), Hemipsilichthys gobio, H. 

papillatus, Delturus parahybae (Loricariidae, Delturinae), Rineloricaria lanceolata, 

Spatuloricaria sp. 1 (Loricariidae, Loricariinae), Hypostomus ancistroides, H. 

nigromaculatus and H. microstomus (Loricariidae, Hypostominae) were included in 

the analysis as additional outgroups as in the work of Roxo et al. (2014).  

 

DNA Extraction and Sequencing 

All protocols for DNA extraction and sequencing were previously reported in Roxo et 

al. (2014), however, for convenience of the readers the methods are reintroduced in 

the present work. The total DNA was extracted from ethanol-preserved muscle, fin 

and liver samples, following the protocol described by Aljanabi &amp;amp; Martinez (1997), 

or with the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, 

USA). Partial sequences of each gene were amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction 

(PCR) with the following primers: Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI - Ward et 

al., 2005), FishF1 - 5?-TCA ACC AAC CAC AAA GAC ATT GGC AC-3?, FishR1 - 

5?-TAG ACT TCT GGG TGG CCA AAG AAT CA-3?; Cytochrome B (CytB - 

Oliveira et al., 2011), L14841 - 5?-CCA TCC AAC ATC TCA GCA TGA TGA AA

(Kocher et al., 1989), 16Sar - 5?-ACG CCT GTT TAT CAA AAA CAT-3?, 16Sbr - 

5?-CCG GTC TGA ACT CAG ATC ACG T-3?; F-Reticulon 4 (Chiachio et al., 

2008), Freticul4-D - 5?-AGG CTA ACT CGC TYT SGG CTT TG-3?, Freticul4-R -

GGA ATG GAA AC-3?, Freticul4 R2 - 5?-AAR TCC ATC TCA CGC AGG A-3?, 

Freticul4 iR - 5?-AGG CTC TGC AGT TTC TCT AG-3?. Amplifications were 

performed in a total volume of 12.5 µl with 1.25 µl of 10 X buffer (10 mM Tris-

HCl+15 mM MgCl2), 0.5 µl dNTPs (200 nM of each), 0 5 µl each 5 mM primer, 0.05 

µl Platinum Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen), 1 µl template DNA (12 ng), and 8.7 µl 

ddH2O. The PCR reactions consisted of 30–40 cycles, 30 s at 95ºC, 15–30 s at 48–

58ºC, and 45–90 s at 72ºC. Nested-PCRs were used to amplify the nuclear marker; the 



125 

 

first amplification was performed using the primers Freticul4-D and Freticul4-R with 

a total volume of 12 5 µl for 30–40 cycles (30 s at 95ºC, 30 s at 48ºC, and 135 s at 

72ºC); the second amplification was performed using the primers Freticul4 D2 and 

Freticul4 R2 with a total volume of 12 5 µl for 30–40 cycles (30 s at 95ºC, 30 s at 53–

54ºC, and 135 s at 72ºC). All PCR products were first visually identified on a 1% 

agarose gel and then purified using ExoSap-IT (USB Corporation) following 

instructions of the manufacturer. The purified PCR products were sequenced using 

the “Big DyeTM Terminator v 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit” (Applied 

Biosystems), purified again by ethanol precipitation and loaded on an automatic 

sequencer 3130-Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) in the Instituto de 

Biociências, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP), municipality of Botucatu, São 

Paulo State, Brazil. 

 

Phylogenetic analysis 

All protocols sequence and phylogenetic analysis also are quite similar to the 

procedures of Roxo et al. (2014), with small modifications reported below. Individual 

sequences of each species were initially analyzed with BioEdit 5.0.9 software (Hall, 

1999), and a consensus sequence was obtained for each DNA segment. Next, all 

sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) under default parameters and 

the alignments were visually inspected for any obvious misalignments. To evaluate 

the occurrence of substitution saturation for each gene separately, we estimated the 

index of substitution saturation (Iss) as described by Xia et al. (2003) and Xia &amp;amp; 

Lemey (2009) and the rate of transitions/transversions, both evaluated in the software 

DAMBE 5.2.31 (Xia &amp;amp; Xie, 2001). The Iss estimation was performed without taking 

into account gaps because unresolved sites reduce the ability of the method to test for 

phylogenetic signal. The best-fit nucleotide evolution model for the entire matrix was 

evaluated in the software PartitionFinder (Lanfear et al., 2012) under the information-

theoretic measure of Akaike Information Criterion (AICc). 

 Maximum likelihood analyses (RAxML) were performed on the CIPRES 

Science Gateway computing cluster (Miller et al., 2010). Bootstrap (BS) resampling 

(Felsenstein, 1985) was applied to assess support for individual nodes using 1,000 

replicates. Random starting trees were used for each independent ML tree search and 

all other parameters were set on default values. The ML analyses were conducted 

under GTR+G model as determined by the software PartitionFinder.

Avaichthys canoeiro, new species 

 

Diagnosis 

Avaichthys differs from all other Otothyrinae genera by having three exclusive 

characters: (1) pectoral girdle not exposed in ventral view (v. pectoral girdle 

completely or partially exposed), Fig. 1; (2) pectoral fin with seven (i,7 in 49 

specimens) to eight (i,8 in one specimen) branched rays, Fig. 2 (v. six [i,6] branched 

rays); and (3) by having the pelvic-fin unbranched ray larger than pectoral-fin 

unbranched ray in males, Fig. 1 (v. the pelvic-fin unbranched ray shorter than 

pectoral-fin unbranched ray in males). Furthermore, the new genus differs from all 

Otothyrinae genera, except Gymnotocinclus by (4) the absence of dermal plates on 

snout tip, Fig. 3 (v. presence of plates on snout tip); and from all Otothyrinae genera, 

except Parotocinclus by (5) the presence of an adipose fin, Fig. 1 (v. absence of 

adipose fin in Corumbataia, Curculionichthys, Epactionotus, Eurycheilichthys, 

Gymnotocinclus, Hisonotus, Microlepidogaster, Otothyropsis, Otothyris, 

Pseudotothyris and Rhinolekos). 

 

Etymology 

The generic name “Avaichthys” is a combination of the word “Avá” from the Tupi 

Guarani Language, meaning “man, people”. It is in reference to indigenous people 

Avá-Canoeiro who used to inhabit vast areas of Central Brazil, including marginal 

areas of rio Maranhão and Tocantins, actually in Goiás State, Brazil. This name is 

masculine.

dorsal portion of the first four branched pelvic-fin rays; (3) the pelvic-fin unbranched 

ray larger than pectoral-fin unbranched ray. Additionally, males seem to reach larger 

size.  

 

Etymology 

The specific name “canoeiro” is from the Portuguese language, meaning those person 

or people who handle and/or build canoes. The name is a reference to the indigenous 



130 

 

people Avá-Canoeiro. In other times numerous and a powerful indigenous force 

inhabiting the the upper rio Tocantins valley, the Avá-Canoeiro are actually restricted 

to some small villages due to a series of gradual and abrupt murders, diseases and the 

lack of legal hunting territories (Pequeno, 2005). Recently, the Avá-Canoeiro were 

known as the “invisible people” due to the fact that some of the few survivors used to 

live for more than a decade in caves to avoid contact to civilization, just leaving the 

caves by night to collect and chase food. The Avá-Canoeiros are menaced to 

extinction. 

 

Distribution 

Avaichthys canoeiro is known from a single locality of a small unknown-named river, 

a tributary of rio das Almas, which flows to rio Paranã, rio Tocantins basin, Brazil 

(Fig. 5).  

 

Ecological Notes 

The new species Avaichthys canoeiro is found in a clear water river, varying from 

small to medium sized, with rocky outcrops forming small waterfalls and substrates of 

rocks and sand, Fig. 6. In large portions of the unknown-named river (tributary of rio 

das Almas), where the new species was found, the marginal vegetation was well 

preserved, and due to the large trees there is poor light penetration. The species was 

found at the bottom of the river associated with substrates of rocks and wood.  

 

Phylogenetic analysis 

The sequences of 136 specimens are present in Table S1. This list is the same 

presented in Roxo et al. (2014), except for the inclusion of the vouchers and GenBank 

accession numbers for the Avaichthys canoeiro, Gymnotocinclus anosteos, 

Nannoplecostomus eleonorae, Plesioptopoma curvidens, Pareiorhina pelicicei, 

Pareiorhina cepta, Pareiorhina brachyrhyncha, Pareiorhina sp. 1, Microlepidogaster 

arachas, Microlepidogaster longicolla, Microlepidogaster sp. 1 and 

Microlepidogaster sp. 2. The concatenated dataset resulted in a matrix of 4,406 base 

pairs (bps), of which 1,462 bps were conserved and 2,561 bps were variable. This 

matrix was used in the phylogenetic analysis. The data of the concatenated matrix 

were not saturated, considering that the Iss.c value is higher than the Iss, and the R
2
 

value is higher than 0 7 for transitions and transversions.

Our results are very similar to those of Roxo et al. (2014), especially 

considering to the monophyly of the subfamilies Hypoptopomatinae, 

Neoplecostominae and Otothyrinae (Fig. 7) with high statistical support (i.e. &gt; 50%). 

In our analysis the Neoplecostominae was also close related to the Otothyrinae, with 

the Hypoptopomatinae forming the sister group to them. Avaichthys canoeiro was 

nested in the Otothyrinae (Fig. 7), forming a sister group to the monotypic genus 

Gymnotocinclus. We also included samples of Nannoplecostomus eleonorae that 

appeared as the sister group to all other species of Neoplecostominae, and 

Plesioptopoma curvidens that appeared within Neoplecostominae forming a sister 

clade to all species of Neoplecostomus, except N. ribeirensis and all species of 

Pareiorhina, except P. rudolphi.  

 

DISCUSSION 

Phylogenetic analysis 

Avaichthys  

 The new genus and species Avaichthys canoeiro appeared in this study within 

the subfamily Otothyrinae forming a sister group to the monotypic genus 

Gymnotocinclus. Carvalho et al. (2008) suggested that G. anosteos could be close 

related to species of the genus Corumbataia by the presence of an adnate maxillary 

barbell. Our present study partially corroborates this study considering that the 

species of Corumbataia are sister group of Avaichthys canoeiro plus Gymnotocinclus 

anosteos, and that Avaichthys canoeiro also present the adnate maxillary barbell. 

Furthermore, all this clade appeared in our phylogenetic analysis forming the sister 

group to the recently described genus Curculionichthys (Roxo et al., 2015) (Fig. 8). 

Carvalho et al. (2008) also suggested that G. anosteos could represent a basal clade 

among the hypoptopomatines (considered in that study as the tribes Otothyrini and 

Hypoptopomatini), because the genus lacks the pectoral-fin slit, and that according to 

Reis &amp;amp; Schaefer (1998) and Gauger &amp;amp; Buckup (2005) the absence of this character 

suggest a basal position within hypoptopomatine. Our results also partially 

corroborate this hypothesis considering that the clade composed by Gymnotocinclus 

anosteos, Avaichthys canoeiro, species of Corumbataia and Curculionichthys are in a 

basal position within the Otothyrinae. However, the pectoral-fin axillary slit is present 

in all species of both Corumbataia and Curculionichthys, but it is absent in 

Gymnotocinclus anosteos and Avaichthys canoeiro. 



132 

 

In the original description of Nannoplecostomus eleonorae the phylogenetic 

analysis using morphological data performed by Ribeiro et al. (2012) suggested that 

Nannoplecostomus consists of a distinctive lineage within Loricariidae, not assigned 

to any of the previously recognized subfamilies (incertae sedis within Loricariidae), 

but forming a sister group to species of Hypostominae (sensu Armbruster, 2008). 

Despite in our present study Nannoplecostomus eleonorae appears forming a sister 

clade to all species of Neoplecostominae it is still possible that it makes part of a non 

described subfamily.  

Reis et al. (2012) said that Plesioptopoma curvidens presented several 

character shared with species of Otothyrinae (recognized as Hypoptopomatinae in that 

study) and Neoplecostominae. However, the authors preferred to include this taxon in 

Otothyrinae based on the presence of: (1) open nasal capsule; (2) enlarged fenestrae 

on the compound pterotic; (3) metapterygoid channel present; (4) arrector fossae 

completely opened (a plesiomorphic state of Schaefer, 1998); (5) ventral surface of 

the coracoid partially exposed. Furthermore, Reis et al. (2012) recognized another 

character shared with species of Kronichthys (Neoplecostominae) and species of the 

genera Eurycheilichthys, Epactionotus, and some Parotocinclus species where the 

odontodes on the ventral surface of the pelvic-fin unbranched ray are distinctly bent 

and turned mesially. The authors also suggested that P. curvidens has similarities to 

Parotocinclus prata, Gymnotocinclus and Pseudotocinclus (Otothyrinae). However, 

our phylogenetic analysis does not corroborate this hypothesis considering that 

Plesioptopoma curvidens appeared forming sister group with all species of 

Neoplecostomus, except N. ribeirensis plus all species of Pareiorhina, except P. 

rudolphi.  

The four species of Microlepidogaster (M. arachas, M. longicolla, 

Microlepidogaster sp. 1 and Microlepidogaster sp. 2) included in the present study do 

not appeared close related to each other suggesting that this genus could be 

paraphyletic. Microlepidogaster arachas described by Martins et al. (2013) and the 

two new species Microlepidogaster sp. 1 and Microlepidogaster sp. 2 from rio São 

Francisco basin appeared close related to Hisonotus bocaiuva which is also from the 

rio São Francisco basin. However, a phylogenetic study including a large number of 

representative species of Hisonotus, including its type species Microlepidogaster 

perforatus, would be necessary to corroborate this hypothesis.  



133 

 

In our phylogenetic study we included all the described species of 

Pareiorhina. This genus appeared paraphyletic, with the type species P. rudolphi 

being close related to Pseudotocinclus tietensis and P. juquiae, than to the remaining 

species of Pareiorhina (i.e. P. pelicicei, P. cepta, P. brachyrhyncha, P. hyptiorhachis, 

P. carrancas). Additionally, the possible new species Pareiorhina sp. 1 from São 

Francisco basin appeared in a phylogenetic clade close related to all species of 

Neoplecostomus, except N. ribeirensis. This result suggests that the species of 

Pareiorhina which are not close related with the type species P. rudolphi may be part 

of a new genus. Our research group are working in the morphological revision of the 

genus Pareiorhina and the formal description of this new genus are beyond the scope 

of this present study.  

 

Taxonomical analysis  

Avaichthys canoeiro was distinguished from the species of Otothyrinae by three 

exclusive characters: (1) the pectoral girdle not exposed in ventral view, (2) the 

pectoral fin with seven to eight branched rays, and by having (3) the pelvic-fin 

unbranched ray larger than pectoral-fin unbranched ray in males. The first character is 

widespread in most loricariid subfamilies, except in Otothyrinae and 

Hypoptopomatinae. Within Otothyrinae only some species of Parotocinclus (i.e. 

Parotocinclus jegui, P. prata and P. robustus) and Hisonotus pachysarkos present the 

pectoral girdle almost completely covered by skin, with a very small area exposed, 

and not completely covered by skin as in the Avaichthys canoeiro. In some species of 

Microlepidogaster (e.g. M. arachas) and Rhinolekos (e.g. R. britskii) the pectoral 

girdle also have a large area covered by skin with a small area exposed.  

 The second character (i.e. the pectoral fin with seven to eight branched rays) is 

common in species of Lamontichthys (Paixão &amp;amp; Toledo-Piza, 2009), which all species 

have seven rays in the pectoral fin, as well as it is present in Harttia leiopleura 

(Oyakawa, 1993) and Rineloricaria daraha (Rapp Py-Daniel &amp;amp; Fichberg, 2008). All 

other loricariid species present six rays on pectoral fin. The third character used to 

diagnose Avaichthys canoeiro is the pelvic-fin unbranched ray larger than the 

pectoral-fin unbranched ray in males, and it is widespread in some neoplecostomine 

as Hirtella carinatta, Plesioptopoma curvidens and in species of Pareiorhaphis and 

Neoplecostomus, however this character was up to now absent in species of 

Otothyrinae.

Abstract

Ecological opportunity is often proposed as a driver of accelerated diversification, but

evidence has been largely derived from either contemporary island radiations or the

fossil record. Here, we investigate the potential influence of ecological opportunity on

a transcontinental radiation of South American freshwater fishes. We generate a spe-

cies-dense, time-calibrated molecular phylogeny for the suckermouth armored catfish

subfamily Hypostominae, with a focus on the species-rich and geographically wide-

spread genus Hypostomus. We use the resulting chronogram to estimate ancestral geo-
graphical ranges, infer historical rates of cladogenesis and diversification in habitat

and body size and shape, and test the hypothesis that invasions of previously unoccu-

pied river drainages accelerated evolution and contributed to adaptive radiation. Both

the subfamily Hypostominae and the included genus Hypostomus originated in the
Amazon/Orinoco ecoregion. Hypostomus subsequently dispersed throughout tropical
South America east of the Andes Mountains. Consequent to invasion of the peripheral,

low-diversity Paran?a River basin in southeastern Brazil approximately 12.5 Mya,

Paran?a lineages of Hypostomus, experienced increased rates of cladogenesis and eco-
logical and morphological diversification. Contemporary lineages of Paran?a Hyposto-
mus are less species rich but more phenotypically diverse than their congeners
elsewhere. Accelerated speciation and morphological diversification rates within

Paran?a basin Hypostomus are consistent with adaptive radiation. The geographical
remoteness of the Paran?a River basin, its recent history of marine incursion, and its

continuing exclusion of many species that are widespread in other tropical South

American rivers suggest that ecological opportunity played an important role in facili-

tating the observed accelerations in diversification.

Introduction

A central aim of evolutionary biology is to understand

why species richness and phenotypic diversity are

unevenly distributed across the tree of life (Stanley

1998; Mace et al. 2003; Venditti et al. 2010; Rabosky et al.

2012). Life is replete with examples of both ‘explosive

radiations’ – characterized by rapid diversification into
staggering numbers of species and phenotypes (e.g.

African cichlid fishes, Caribbean Anolis lizards,

Hawaiian silversword plants) – and ‘living fossil’ lin-
eages – characterized by low species richness and mor-
phological stasis for much of their evolutionary history

(e.g. lungfishes, tuatara, Equisetum; Rabosky et al. 2013).

Causes for such disparity can be broadly divided into

mechanisms that accelerate speciation and/or pheno-

typic diversification rates (e.g. adaptive radiation, mimi-

cry rings) and those that require no differences in

underlying rates (e.g. differences in clade age or extinc-

tion rate). Only recently, with the advent of low-cost,

fast and comprehensive molecular data (e.g. Boubli

et al. 2012; Rabosky et al. 2012; Sorenson et al. 2014) and

a growing plethora of comparative statistical techniques

(e.g. Ricklefs 2007; Alfaro et al. 2009; Paradis 2011; Rev-

ell 2012; Rabosky 2014) have both robust phylogenies

and techniques for identifying potential mechanisms

been available to biologists. A major current goal to link

results of these evolutionary models to climatic and

geophysical processes to understand how large-scale

Earth processes influence biological diversification.

Broadly distributed radiations of freshwater fishes are

excellent systems in which to investigate linkages

between biological diversification and geomorphological

processes that shape the Earth’s surface. Freshwater

fishes are highly diverse, and most are entirely

restricted to freshwater habitats. Moreover, physical

connections and slopes between and within these habi-

tats shift in response to geomorphic processes. Phyloge-

nies of freshwater fishes often reflect these events

(Smith 1981; Hocutt &amp;amp; Wiley 1986; Mayden 1988; Lund-

berg et al. 1998; Cardoso et al. 2012; Lujan et al. 2015a;

Tagliacollo et al. 2015). Indeed, geomorphological pro-

cesses involving both the division of previously con-

tiguous populations and the passive geodispersal of

species between drainages have been linked to freshwa-

ter fish speciation and diversification both theoretically

and empirically (Grant et al. 2007; Muneepeerakul et al.

2008; Winemiller et al. 2008; Bertuzzo et al. 2009; Albert

&amp;amp; Crampton 2010).

When an evolutionary lineage reaches a new environ-

ment, such as an island or drainage basin that lacks

similar species, it may gain access to ecological oppor-

tunities that promote diversification by relaxing selec-

tion on ecologically important traits (Ehrlich &amp;amp; Raven

1964; Yoder et al. 2010). In some noteworthy instances,

this leads to adaptive radiation in which a clade dis-

plays accelerated diversification rates, correlation

between ecological and phenotypic traits, and newly

derived traits that permit increased performance

(Schluter 2000). Although causal connections between

ecological opportunity and biological diversification are

often difficult to establish and differentiate from other

drivers, macroevolutionary evidence for ecological

opportunity’s importance is strong. First, long-term

decreases in rates of lineage and morphological diversi-

fication are common in many lineages throughout the

fossil and extant biological record (Soltis et al. 2002;

Mahler et al. 2010). Such decreases are primarily attribu-

ted to the saturation of niche space – that is the decline
of ecological opportunity due to increasing exploitation

– that is an expected consequence of species accumula-
tion (Simpson 1949, 1953). Second, fossil and molecular

data for some groups (e.g. trilobites, Hallam &amp;amp; Wignall

1997; mammals, Meredith et al. 2011) suggest that speci-

ation rates have increased following mass extinctions –
that is periods of increased ecological opportunity due

to niche vacancies (Sepkoski 1981, 1998, 2002; Erwin

et al. 1987; Erwin 2001).

In addition to these macroevolutionary patterns, the-

ory predicts a number of shorter-term, population-level,

ecological and physiological responses to increased eco-

logical opportunity. For example, after a lineage reaches

a new environment, its population may increase, it may

occupy a broader range of microhabitats, and it may

display a broader range of morphological or beha-

vioural characteristics as a result of decreased competi-

tive pressure (Crowell 1962; Losos &amp;amp; de Queiroz 1997).

Easier access to new or alternative resources created by

ecological opportunity should effectively flatten the

adaptive landscape, making a wider range of pheno-

types viable (Roughgarden 1972; Travis 1989; Lathi et al.

2009). This is supported by empirical studies of popula-

tions that show a broader range of phenotypes follow-

ing release from predation, competition or other sources

of stabilizing selection (Roughgarden 1972; Houle et al.

1994). Access to the extrinsic opportunities and mecha-

nisms that are linked to invasion of a new environment

are often dependent upon intrinsic aspects of a species’

life history (e.g. vagility, fecundity, body size, ecological

tolerance). Vagile species are more likely to invade a

new habitat than philopatric species, and eurytopic spe-

cies, which exhibit broad physiological and habitat tol-

erances, are more likely to succeed in a new habitat

(Vrba 1980; Ribbink 1994).

Hypostominae is a species-rich (c. 447 valid species

and 38 genera; Eschmeyer &amp;amp; Fong 2015) and mono-

phyletic (Lujan et al. 2015b) group of primarily herbivo-

rous and detritivorous catfishes restricted to the

freshwaters of tropical Central and South America.

Despite being broadly constrained to the primary con-

sumer niche, Hypostominae lineages are known to dis-

play a wide range of jaw morphologies consistent with

their fine-scale partitioning of basal food resources

including algae, detritus and wood (Lujan et al. 2011,

2012; Lujan &amp;amp; Armbruster 2012). Containing approxi-

mately 141, or about 30%, of all valid Hypostominae

species, Hypostomus is the most species-rich genus in

the subfamily and is among the most common and

ubiquitous fish genera throughout the continental fresh-

waters of tropical South America. Our goal in this study

was to examine the hypothesis that geographical disper-

sal via landscape-scale geomorphological events has

accelerated rates of diversification of lineages (cladogen-

esis), maximum body size (MBS), and body shape

within Hypostominae, particularly in the genus Hypos-

tomus. We do this by (i) generating a species-dense,

time-calibrated phylogeny for Hypostominae with a

focus on Hypostomus, (ii) using the obtained chrono-

gram to estimate ancestral geographical ranges and (iii)

infer historical diversification rates in occupied habitat,

body size and body shape.

Material and methods

Taxon sampling

Our objective in taxonomic sampling was to compre-

hensively sample genera within Hypostominae (sensu

Lujan et al. 2015b) and to maximize the breadth of gen-

era representing other loricariid subfamilies and tribes.

Our in-group (Hypostominae) included 124 specimens

spanning 24 genera and four to five tribes (sensu Lujan

et al. 2015b). To test for monophyly of Hypostominae,

we compiled a broad range of outgroups representing

all other subfamilies of Loricariidae plus Astroblepidae

and Callichthyidae. Specimens sequenced for this study

are listed in Tables S1 and S2 (Supporting information).

Sequence data for many taxa outside the Hypostomi-

nae, including members of the subfamilies Loricariinae,

Hypoptopomatinae and Rhinelepinae, were obtained

from previously published studies (Montoya-Burgos

et al. 1998; Chiachio et al. 2008; Covain &amp;amp; Fisch-Muller

2012; Roxo et al. 2012, 2014) via the GenBank database.

Members of two other Loricarioidei families (Astrob-

lepidae: Astroblepus sp. and Callichthyidae: Hoploster-

num littorale, Corydoras imitator and C. oiapoquensis) were

selected as outgroups based on relationships established

in previous larger-scale phylogenetic analyses of both

morphological (de Pinna 1993, 1998) and molecular

(Sullivan et al. 2006) data. Vouchers of all sequenced

samples were deposited in the Auburn University Nat-

ural History Museum, Auburn, Alabama, USA (AUM);

mento de Morfologia, Instituto de Biocie?ncias, Universi-

Gen?eve, Gen?eve, Switzerland (MHNG); or at the Smith-

sonian Tropical Research Institute, Balboa, Anc?on,

Panama (STRI). Specimens were identified directly by

the authors GSCS and CHZ, except in the case of Gen-

Bank identifications, which were not changed.

DNA extraction and sequencing

Whole-genomic DNA was extracted from muscle, fin or

liver samples preserved in 95% ethanol using the

Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madi-

son, WI, USA). Partial sequences of the 16S rRNA, cyto-

chrome b (cyt b) and F-reticulon 4 (RTN4) genes were

amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR; primers

listed in Table S3, Supporting information). Amplifica-

tions were performed in a total volume of 12.5 lL with
1.25 lL of 109 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl+15 mM MgCl2),
0.5 lL dNTPs (200 nM of each), 0.5 lL of each 5 mM pri-
mer, 0.05 lL Platinum? Taq Polymerase (LTI: Life Tech-
nologies Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA), 1 lL template DNA
(approximately 12 ng) and 8.7 lL ddH2O. PCRs con-
sisted of 30–40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 15–30 s at 48–
58 °C and 45–90 s at 72 °C (annealing temperature and
duration depended on primers and species, Table S3,

Supporting information). Nested PCRs were used to

amplify the nuclear marker RTN4; the first amplifica-

tion was performed using the primers Freticul4-D and

Freticul4-R with a total volume of 12.5 lL for 30–40
cycles (30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 48 °C and 135 s at 72 °C);
and the second amplification was performed using the

primers Freticul4 D2 and Freticul4 R2 with a total vol-

ume of 12.5 lL for 30–40 cycles (30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at
53–54 °C and 135 s at 72 °C). All PCR products were
first visually identified on a 1% agarose gel and then

purified using ExoSap-IT? (USB Corporation, Cleve-

land, OH, USA) following manufacturers’ instructions.

Purified PCR products were sequenced using the Big

Dye? Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction

Kit (ABI: Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster, CA, USA),

purified again by ethanol precipitation and sequenced

on a 3130 Genetic Analyzer (ABI) in the Instituto de

Biocie?ncias, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Botucatu,

S~ao Paulo State.

Sequence alignment and phylogenetic inference

Two intronic regions of the RTN4 gene, totalling 63% of

total locus length, were amplified and sequenced by

our primers. All loci, including the entire RTN4

sequence, were first aligned using the MUSCLE algorithm

(default parameters; Edgar 2004) followed by visual

inspection and correction of the alignment requiring

almost no changes in base position. The total matrix

consisted of 157 individuals 9 3433 base pairs, or a

total of approximately 548 800 characters, of which 40%

were missing data. To detect potential sequencing

errors due to contamination or paralogy, alignments for

each gene were separately analysed by maximum likeli-

hood (ML; Stamatakis et al. 2008) using the web server

RAXML BLACKBOX (Stamatakis 2006). Sequences that

resulted in obviously misplaced taxa in resulting gene

trees were resequenced or eliminated from subse-

quent analyses. Because terminal redundancy can

affect results of biogeographical analyses using disper-

sal–extinction–cladogenesis (DEC) models, we trimmed
our final data set to include only one individual of each

species.

We estimated the index of substitution saturation

(Iss) and rates of transitions/transversions for each gene

separately in DAMBE 5.2.31 (Xia &amp;amp; Xie 2001), as described

by Xia et al. (2003) and Xia &amp;amp; Lemey (2009). Iss was

estimated without considering gaps because unresolved

sites reduce the ability of the method to test for phylo-

genetic signal. The best-fit partitioning scheme and

nucleotide substitution model for each partition were

determined using the greedy algorithm in the software

PARTITIONFINDER (Lanfear et al. 2012), which was pro-

grammed to use PHYML to estimate likelihoods and the

Akaike information criterion with correction for finite

sample sizes (AICc) to choose the best model.

Maximum-likelihood (ML) analyses (Stamatakis et al.

2008) were performed using RAXML on the CIPRES

Science Gateway computing cluster (Miller et al. 2010).

RAXML implements a fast algorithm of heuristic searches

using bootstrap (BS) resampling (Felsenstein 1985). Sup-

port for individual nodes was assessed using random

start trees, the GTR+G model for all partitions of the
matrix as determined by the software PARTITIONFINDER

(Lanfear et al. 2012; Table S4, Supporting information),

and independent ML tree searches consisting of 1000

pseudoreplicates each with all other parameters set to

default values.

Bayesian inference (BI; Huelsenbeck &amp;amp; Ronquist 2001)

was used to determine statistical support for alternative

tree topologies through the estimation of posterior prob-

abilities using the software MRBAYES V3.2.2 (Ronquist

et al. 2012). This was made under different models for

each partition of the matrix as determined by the soft-

ware PARTITIONFINDER (Table S4, Supporting information),

using a random tree to start the Markov chain Monte

Carlo searches, and a duplex of four chains

(nchains = 4) set to run simultaneously for 10 million
generations, sampling tree space every 500th genera-

tion. This analysis was performed twice to ensure simi-

larity of converged trees. Log-likelihood scores were

calculated using the program TRACER 1.5 (Rambaut &amp;amp;

Drummond 2007a) to determine whether independent

searches of tree space had achieved stationarity based

on their convergence within a stable – Ln range of val-
ues and effective sample sizes (ESS) exceeding 200. All

sampled topologies beneath the asymptote (40%) were

discarded as burn-in, and remaining trees were used

to construct a 50% majority-rule consensus tree in

TREEANNOTATOR V1.7.5 (Rambaut &amp;amp; Drummond 2007b).

Tree topology tests

Alternative tree topologies hypothesized by Lujan et al.

(2015a,b) were evaluated in the program TREEFINDER

(Jobb et al. 2004) using the Shimodaira and Hasegawa

(SH) test (Shimodaira &amp;amp; Hasegawa 1999), the Approxi-

mately Unbiased (AU) test (Shimodaira 2002) and the

Expected Likelihood Weights (ELW) method (Strimmer

&amp;amp; Rambaut 2002). All tests were conducted under ML

with the same 12-partition model as implemented in

the RAXML analysis (Table S4, Supporting information).

Time calibration

The uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock (log-normal)

was estimated using BEAST V1.7.5. (Drummond &amp;amp; Ram-

baut 2007). We used a clade-based approach that

included each Hypostominae lineage in our analysis.

The GTR+G model was used for all partitions (Table S4,
Supporting information). The calibration prior was

implemented using a log-normal distribution offset to

55 Mya with a mean and standard deviation of 1 for

the origin of the genus Corydoras lineage (node includ-

ing all Callichthyidae: Corydoras imitator, C. oiapoquensis

and Hoplosternum littorale). The oldest known loricarioid

fossil, Corydoras revelatus Cockerell (1925), was dated by

Marshall et al. (1997) as Paleocene, which we used to

assign a 55 My minimum age for the family Callichthyi-

dae. We used a birth–death model for speciation likeli-
hood and a starting tree obtained from ML. The

analysis was run for 10 million generations and sam-

pled every 1000th generation. Stationary and sufficient

mixing of parameters (ESS &gt; 200) was checked using
TRACER V1.5 (Rambaut &amp;amp; Drummond 2007a). A consen-

sus tree was built using TREEANNOTATOR V1.7.5 (Rambaut

&amp;amp; Drummond 2007b).

Ancestral area estimation

Data on the geographical distributions of species in the

Hypostominae were taken from the original species

descriptions and information available from the online

Catalog of Fishes (Eschmeyer &amp;amp; Fong 2015). To main-

tain consistency with previous biogeographical analyses

of the subfamily Hypoptopomatinae (sensu Lujan et al.

2015b) by Chiachio et al. (2008) and Roxo et al. (2014),

we assigned taxa to geographical areas using the ecore-

gion classification of Vari (1998), which was derived

from patterns of endemism in the Neotropical endemic

characiform family Curimatidae. Our samples were

drawn from the following six of Vari’s (1998) ecore-

gions: (i) Atlantic Coastal drainages, (ii) upper Paran?a

basin, (ii) Paraguay, lower Paran?a and Uruguay basins,

(iv) Amazon and Orinoco basins, (v) S~ao Francisco

basin and Northeastern Brazilian drainages and (vi)

Pacific Coastal drainages and Magdalena basin.

Maximum-likelihood inference of geographical range

evolution was performed using the dispersal–extinc-
tion–cladogenesis (DEC) model as implemented in
LAGRANGE v2.0 (Ree et al. 2005; Ree &amp;amp; Smith 2008). Four

DEC models were tested to estimate distribution ranges

inherited by descending lineages at each node of the

tree. Each model differed in the rates of dispersal

between adjacent vs. nonadjacent areas (see Table S5,

Supporting information for likelihood values and dis-

persal rates for each model). Model 3 (M3), which con-

strained dispersal rates between adjacent areas at 0.5

and areas separated by one or more intervening areas

at 0.0001, obtained the highest ML values.

Speciation rates

We used BAMM version 2.1.0 (Rabosky 2014) to estimate

speciation and extinction rates across the Hypostominae

phylogeny. We assessed the effects of missing taxa on

our tree by counting missing species for each lineage of

our phylogeny (see Table S2, Supporting information for

summary of missing genera and species). The analysis

was conducted with two chains running simultaneously

for a total of 5 million generations and tree space being

sampled every 1000th generation. We used a burn-in

value of 0.5 and checked for MCMC convergence using

the BAMMTOOLS package (Rabosky et al. 2014) in the R sta-

tistical environment (R Core Team 2014) to plot log-likeli-

hood values. To account for effects of phylogenetic

uncertainty on our analyses, we conducted BAMM anal-

yses of species diversification across 2500 trees sampled

from the posterior distribution of topologies and branch

lengths. To visualize the evolutionary rate dynamics

from BAMM output results, we also used BAMMTOOLS.

Morphometric data

We measured 33 morphometric characters (doi: 10.5061/

dryad.c8q11) on the bodies of two adult specimens from

each of 124 specimens and 24 genera of Hypostominae,

using 31 homologous landmarks originally proposed by

Armbruster (2003a): 14 on the head, five on the mouth

and the remainder on the trunk or fins. Although the suite

of measurements we used was originally intended to

maximize homology and taxonomic discrimination (Arm-

bruster 2003a), many of the measurements are known to

be functional, ecological correlates (e.g. mouth width,

tooth row length, eye size, eye position, body depth, fin

size; Gatz 1979; Winemiller 1991; Lujan &amp;amp; Armbruster

2012). All analyses described later are based on means of

log-transformed trait values computed for each species.

To remove the influence of body size on morphometric

data, we used the program PAST V1.28 (Hammer et al.

2004) to normalize two coordinate dimensions, to divide

all coordinate values by the centroid size for each speci-

men and to conduct a Procrustes fitting of the left half to a

mirrored version of the right half (Dryden &amp;amp; Mardia

1998). We conducted a principal component analysis

(PCA) using the covariance matrix of phylogenetically

corrected residuals from the Past output. The first princi-

pal component (PC1) in the matrix of residuals accounted

for 27.5% of variance in body shape for Hypostominae

(values used for BAMM and phylomorphospace analy-

ses) and 22.4% for Hypostomus (values used for an inde-

pendent phylomorphospace analysis). PCA loadings are

presented in Table S6 (Supporting information).

Diversification rates

We used BAMM version 2.1.0 (Rabosky 2014) to estimate

rates of continuous trait evolution in body shape and

maximum body size (MBS) values across the Hypos-

tominae phylogeny. These analyses were conducted

with two chains running simultaneously for a total of

50 million generations, with tree space sampled every

5000th generation. We used a burn-in value of 0.5 and

checked for MCMC convergence using the BAMMTOOLS

package in R (Rabosky et al. 2014). We conducted

BAMM analyses of phenotypic evolution across 5000

trees sampled from the posterior distribution and visu-

alized the evolutionary rate dynamics from BAMM out-

put using BAMMTOOLS.

Habitat data and ancestral state estimation

Each Hypostominae species was classified according to

one or more of the following five habitat categories

(from Albert et al. 2011) based on original species

descriptions, the online Catalog of Fishes (Eschmeyer &amp;amp;

Fong 2015) and the authors’ personal field experience:

channels, rapids, streams, and low or high altitudes

(see Table S2, Supporting information for habitat classi-

fications and values for each species). Habitats for

each species were coded using five binary (presence/

absence) values, and the resulting matrix was examined

in 1000 stochastic character map simulations using Sim-

map (Bollback 2006) in R (R Core Team 2014).

Phylomorphospace analysis

We generated two phylomorphospace biplots (Sid-

lauskas 2008) using the ‘phylomorphospace’ function in

the PHYTOOLS V0.3-10 (Revell 2012) package in R (R Core

Team 2014): one for all Hypostominae species and the

second for only the genus Hypostomus. For each plot,

the first principal component of size-corrected body

shape for each taxonomic grouping was plotted against

log maximum body size (MBS). Species colours in both

plots correspond to ecoregion colour in the ancestral

area estimation. In the Hypostominae plot, a convex

hull was drawn around all Hypostomus species, and in

the Hypostomus plot, a convex hull was drawn around

all species from the Paran?a River basin.

Results

DNA sequence alignment and substitution rates

The concatenated alignment of sequence data for 16S

rRNA, cyt b and RTN4 genes resulted in a matrix con-

sisting 3433 base pairs (bp); 971 bp was conserved and

2283 was variable. We found no evidence for saturation:

the Iss.c value was greater than the Iss value (Xia et al.

2003; Xia &amp;amp; Lemey 2009), and the determination coeffi-

cients of transitions and transversions vs. genetic dis-

tance were higher than 0.7 (transitions R2 = 0.94;
transversions R2 = 0.98). The observed transition/
transversion ratio was 1.9, with nucleotide frequencies

of 25.7% for adenine, 29.2% for thymine/uracil, 26.9%

for cytosine and 18.1% for guanine.

Phylogenetic relationships

Within Hypostominae, our results (Fig. S1–S4, Sup-
porting information) supported monophyly of six of

the nine tribe-level clades identified by Lujan et al.

(2015b): the Chaetostoma Clade (BS = 99, PP = 1), the
‘Pseudancistrus’ Clade (BS = 91, PP = 1), Ancistrini
(BS = 50), the Pseudancistrus Clade (BS = 97, PP = 1),
the Peckoltia clade (BS = 92, PP = 1) and Hypostomini
(BS = 99, PP = 1; see Figs S1–S4, Supporting informa-
tion). One of Lujan et al.’s (2015b) tribe level clades

was not examined (the Lithoxus Clade, consisting of

nine small species restricted to the Guiana Shield),

and two tribe level clades from that study were not

supported as monophyletic: Monophyly of the Hemian-

cistrus Clade, containing the genus Panaque (BS = 100,
PP = 1) and a clade of four other genera (Baryancistrus,
Hemiancistrus, Parancistrus and Spectracanthicus;

BS = 65), was not supported. Also, monophyly of the
Acanthicus Clade, containing our Leporacanthicus clade

(BS = 99, PP = 1) and Megalancistrus clade (BS = 100,

PP = 1), was not supported. However, a topology test
did not reject the hypothesis of monophyly of Lujan

et al.’s (2015b) Acanthicus Clade (i.e. Megalancistrus

being sister to Leporacanthicus + Pseudacanthicus). See
Table S7 (Supporting information) for results of our

topology tests.

Relaxed clock and ancestral area estimation

The mean substitution rate across all loci estimated

using BEAST was 0.29% per My. The subfamily Hypos-

tominae was estimated by BEAST to have originated dur-

ing the Eocene approximately 43.1 Mya (26.3–67.2 Mya
95% HPD; see Fig. 1 for molecular clock tree including

outgroups) and inferred by Lagrange to have originated

in the Amazon/Orinoco ecoregion (Region D). Modern

Hypostominae species are distributed across all six

ecoregions in Fig. 1.

The ancestor of all tribe Hypostomini genera in our

analysis was also hypothesized to have originated in

the Amazon/Orinoco ecoregion approximately

15.1 Mya (8.5–23.6 Mya 95% HPD), as was the genus
Hypostomus. Hypostomus was hypothesized to have

reached the upper Paran?a basin (Region B) approxi-

mately 12.5 Mya (7.2–19.2 Mya 95% HPD). All together,
ancestral Hypostomus lineages were hypothesized to

have dispersed into new drainages several times from

12.5 Mya to the present (see Fig. 1 for all dispersal

events), resulting in their modern distribution across all

but two of the ecoregions in Fig. 1 (i.e. samples missing

only from Region E: S~ao Francisco basin plus North-

eastern Brazilian drainages, and Region F: Pacific

Coastal drainages plus Magdalena basin).

Speciation rates

The mean phylorate plot for speciation suggests that

the tribe Hypostomini experienced consistently higher

cladogenesis rates than any other lineage within

Hypostominae (Fig. 2). Within Hypostomini, speciation

rates were highest in the genus Hypostomus. More-

over, the consensus phylorate plot and marginal prob-

abilities of rate shifts plot support shifts in speciation

rate at the node and along the branch (respectively)

giving rise to Hypostomus. Our speciation rate-

through-time plot suggests that speciation rates

throughout Hypostominae began a steady increase

approximately 15 Mya, coincident with the origin of

the genus Hypostomus (Fig. 2).

Morphometric diversification rates

The mean phylorate plot for morphometric diversifi-

cation (Fig. 3) suggests that the tribe Hypostomini

experienced elevated rates of body shape diversifica-

tion throughout its evolution, with highest rates

observed along branches leading to members of the

genus Hypostomus. Moreover, marginal probabilities

of shifts in body shape diversification show high

probabilities of shifts within the tribe Hypostomini,

with shifts concentrated within Hypostomus (Fig. 3).

The trait rate-through-time plot indicates that overall

rates of Hypostominae body shape diversification

increased slightly and steadily until approximately

5 Mya.

Body size diversification rates

Evolutionary rates of change in log maximum body size

(MBS) were highest in a clade that included a diverse

assemblage of Hypostominae genera (Aphanotorulus,

Hypancistrus, Hypostomus, Leporacanthicus, Megalan-

cistrus, Panaqolus, Panaque, Peckoltia, Pterygoplichthys and

Scobinancistrus). Plots for both the consensus phylorate

and marginal shift probabilities support a shift in body

size diversification rate at the node giving rise to these

genera (Fig. 4).

Ancestral habitat estimation

The stochastic character map analysis indicated that

ancestors of the genus Hypostomus occupied a greater

diversity of habits (i.e. channels, riffles, streams, and

low and high elevations) than any other Hypostominae

lineage (Fig. 5), whereas ancestors of the genus Ancis-

trus occupied the lowest diversity of habitats.

Morphological disparity

The first principal component (PC1) axis explained 27.5%

of the variation for Hypostominae species (Fig. 6A) and

22.4% for Hypostomus species (Fig. 6B). Characters that

loaded strongly on the first principal component for both

Hypostominae and the genus Hypostomus were anal-fin

spine length, mouth width, barbel length, dentary tooth

cup length and premaxillary tooth cup length (Table S6).

Characters that varied more in Hypostomus species than

in Hypostominae as a whole were mostly related to the

head (e.g. head–eye length, snout length and interorbital
width) and fins (e.g. pectoral–spine length, pelvic–spine
length, dorsal–pectoral distance, dorsal–spine length,
adipose–spine length, dorsal–anal distance; Table S6).
Within Hypostominae morphospace, most of the body

size/PC1 range occupied by the genus Hypostomus over-

lapped the distributions of other genera (Fig. 6A),

whereas within Hypostomus, the body size/PC1 area

occupied by species from the Paran?a River spanned most

of the range for the entire genus (Fig. 6B).

Discussion

Macroevolutionary patterns in the suckermouth

armored catfish subfamily Hypostominae indicate that,

beginning approximately 12.5 Mya (95% HPD: 7.2–
19.2 Mya; Fig. 1), the genus Hypostomus underwent

transcontinental dispersal synchronized with acceler-

ated rates of speciation (Fig. 2) and diversification in

body shape (Figs 3, 6 and 7), body size (MBS, Fig. 4)

and habitat diversity (Fig. 5). These and other lines of

evidence (Cardoso et al. 2012) suggest that Hypostomus’

accelerated diversification was at least partly a response

to its repeated invasion of new drainages that likely

had reduced predation and competition for food and

habitat resources – that is ecological opportunity.
Although specific linkages between organismal pheno-

type and either environment or ecological function

remain tenuous at this time, our evidence for mono-

phyly and accelerated diversification in Hypostomus sug-

gest that such ecological opportunities promoted an

adaptive radiation within a lineage that invaded the

upper Paran?a River basin in southeastern Brazil approx-

imately 12.5 Mya (95% HPD: 7.2–19.2 Mya; Fig. 1).

The Paran?a River is the third largest river in South

America by discharge, after the Amazon and Orinoco,

yet it is geographically isolated from the hydrologically

contiguous Amazon/Orinoco basins to the northwest. It

drains southward from highlands of the Brazilian

Shield that separate it from the S~ao Francisco drainage

to the northeast and the Tocantins drainage to the

northwest. Moreover, much of the Paran?a basin was

dominated by marine conditions as recently as the late

Miocene (approx. 10 Mya; Lundberg et al. 1998). Due to

its geographical remoteness and recent marine incur-

sions, the Paran?a River has likely long had a much

more depauperate fish fauna than the Amazon. To this

day, many of the largest and most distinctive Amazo-

nian piscivores and herbivores are missing from the

Paran?a, including all osteoglossiform fishes (e.g. Ara-

paima and Osteoglossum spp.), the electric eel (Electropho-

rus electricus), the pacu (Piaractus brachypomus), as well

as the manatee (Trichechus inunguis) and freshwater dol-

phins (Inia spp.). The peacock bass genus Cichla, which

comprises some of the most ubiquitous and iconic pis-

civorous fishes throughout the Amazon/Orinoco ecore-

gion, has only recently been introduced to the Paran?a

by man (Kullander &amp;amp; Ferreira 2006).

The synchronized cladogenesis and geographical, eco-

logical and morphological diversifications of Hyposto-

mus across tropical South America, combined with this

genus’ accelerated diversification upon entering the spe-

cies-poor Paran?a River basin, are highly suggestive of

ecological opportunity’s influence on this clade’s evolu-

tion. Historical contributions of ecological opportunity

to evolutionary diversifications are often difficult to

conclusively demonstrate, especially in large, continen-

tal radiations like the Hypostominae (Hughes &amp;amp; East-

wood 2006; Antonelli et al. 2009). However, both

intrinsic (i.e. organismal) and extrinsic (i.e. environmen-

tal) drivers of ecological opportunity can be identified

in Hypostomus, contributing to a mechanistic under-

standing of how this genus may have uniquely

exploited ecological opportunities historically present in

the Paran?a River basin.

Intrinsic drivers of accelerated diversification: Evidence
for key innovations

Loricariid catfishes are distinguished from all other

fishes by having a ventral oral disc, diets consisting lar-

gely of algae and detritus, and bodies covered in bony

plates and external teeth (i.e. odontodes). Hypostomus

has no known anatomical traits that might give it a

competitive advantage over other loricariids; however,

Hypostomus species are known to have broad physiolog-

ical tolerances for diverse diets and habitats. These tol-

erances may have facilitated their dispersal and been a

key to their exceptional invasion and diversification

within the Paran?a River basin.

In an evolutionary analysis of trophic diversity across

19 sympatric assemblages of loricariid catfishes, Lujan

et al. (2012) found that Hypostomus species tended to

specialize on the most nutrient-poor (i.e. protein depau-

perate or 15N-depleted; Kelly &amp;amp; del Rio 2010) subsets of

food resources being ingested and assimilated.

Likewise, in a detailed study of resource partitioning

among sympatric wood-eating loricariids in northern

Peru, Lujan et al. (2011) found that a wood-eating mem-

ber of the genus Hypostomus ingested and assimilated

the lowest protein (i.e. most 15N-depleted) fraction of

submerged woody detritus compared to two unrelated

but also wood-eating loricariid genera (i.e. Panaque and

Panaqolus).

The preference or tolerance of Hypostomus species for

presumably nutrient-poor, low-protein subsets of the

food spectrum available to loricariids is complemented

by their occupation of a wide range of habitats. Not

only are Hypostomus ubiquitous and often locally abun-

dant in a wide range of habitats throughout their native

range in tropical South America (Fig. 5; Saint-Paul et al.

2000), they are also among the most adept of all lori-

cariid genera at invading novel habitats outside their

native range. Invasive and often ecologically destructive

populations of Hypostomus are now established in many

drainages around the world, including rivers in Texas

(Pound et al. 2011), Sri Lanka (Bambaradeniya 2002)

and China (Xu et al. 2012). Hypostomus is one of only

two loricariid genera to have broadly established inva-

sive populations outside their native range, the other

being the closely related genus Pterygoplichthys (Capps

&amp;amp; Flecker 2013).

Together, the broad dietary and habitat tolerances of

Hypostomus species indicate that, although this genus

appears to lack key morphological innovations, it likely

has key physiological adaptations that facilitate its inva-

sion and survival in environments that are inhospitable

to most other loricariids. However, more robust com-

parative analyses of physiological tolerances and diet-

ary and habitat preferences across the Loricariidae are

needed to identify specific traits that allow Hypostomus

to be so successful.

Extrinsic drivers of accelerated diversification:
Evidence for open ecological niches

One of the most distinctive and prominent events in the

transcontinental dispersal of Hypostomus is the repeated

invasion of the Paran?a River basin in southeastern Bra-

zil. Results of this and previous (Cardoso et al. 2012)

studies support at least six independent invasions by

ancestral lineages of Hypostomus in the upper Paran?a

(coloured red in Fig. 1; with one large clade occupying

the upper Paran?a basin almost exclusively); four inva-

sions into the Paraguay, lower Paran?a and Uruguay

basins (coloured purple in Fig. 1); and two invasions

into Atlantic Coastal drainages (coloured green in

Fig. 1). To this day, Hypostomus is one of only four

Hypostominae genera to have successfully invaded the

Paran?a River basin, resulting in 52 species, or approxi-

mately 37% of all Hypostomus species, being present

there today. The only other Hypostominae taxa now in

the Paran?a are 13 species of Ancistrus, three species of

Pterygoplichthys and one species of Megalancistrus – each
of which occupies a much narrower range of habitats

than Hypostomus (Fig. 5). The first two of these genera

share with Hypostomus a preference for or tolerance of
15N-depleted food resources (Lujan et al. 2012). Ancis-

trus, though, is phylogenetically distantly related to

Hypostomus, as is Megalancistrus (Lujan et al. 2015b).

The only other loricariid genera present in the Paran?a

basin include two genera of the morphologically dis-

tinct whiptail catfish subfamily Loricariinae (Rinelori-

caria with 21 species in Paran?a basin and Harttia with

two species in Paran?a basin), and a total of 32 much

smaller-bodied species (&lt;10 cm SL) in the subfamily
Hypoptopomatinae (sensu Lujan et al. 2015b; e.g. Hisono-

tus, 17 spp.; Neoplecostomus, eight spp.; Otothyropsis,

four spp.; Pareiorhina, two spp.; Pseudotocinclus, one sp.;

Roxo et al. 2012, 2014). There is no fossil or other evi-

dence to suggest that any other loricariid genera occu-

pied this watershed prior to Hypostomus.

In contrast to the Paran?a Basin, the Amazon and Ori-

noco basins host diverse assemblages of over 30 Hypos-

tominae genera (Lujan et al. 2015b), most of which

overlap Hypostomus in morphospace (Fig. 6). Given the

highly distinctive ecological niche occupied by loricari-

ids as a whole (i.e. benthic, surface-scraping, algivore–
detritivores), the very few other similar loricariid

species present in the Paran?a, and this drainage’s dis-

tinctive history of biogeographical isolation and marine

incursion, it becomes increasingly plausible that when

Hypostomus first invaded the Paran?a River basin, it

experienced at least an initial reduction in competitive

pressure compared with other parts of its range. Of

course, in response to Hypostomus’ adaptive diversifica-

tion and consequent saturation of available niches,

much of the ecological opportunity historically present

in the Paran?a is predicted to have been reduced over

time (Simpson 1949, 1953).

Linking phenotype to environment and ecological
function: Evidence for adaptive radiation in
Hypostomus of the Paran?a River basin

A hallmark of any adaptive radiation (e.g. African cich-

lids, Caribbean anoles, Hawaiian silverswords) is

tremendous phenotypic diversity as compared with clo-

sely related lineages (Rabosky et al. 2013; Brawand et al.

2014). This disparity is echoed in species of Hypostomus

from the Paran?a River basin, which exhibit as great a

range of body shapes and sizes (Fig. 6) and a greater

range of colour patterns (Fig. 7) and jaw and tooth mor-

phologies (authors’ pers. obs.) than congeners through-

out the remainder of the genus’ range. Moreover, many

morphometric traits that are highly variable across

Hypostominae, such as mouth width and premaxillary

and dentary tooth cup lengths (Table S6, Supporting

information), are known to be functionally relevant to

the distinctive feeding biomechanics of loricariids

(Lujan &amp;amp; Armbruster 2012).

Most Amazonian Hypostomus exhibit minor variations

on a colour pattern consisting of black or dark brown

spots on a light brown base colour (Fig. 7A) and exhibit

one of only two distinctive ecomorphotypes representa-

tive of reciprocally monophyletic subgenera (Lujan et al.

2015b). The wood-eater morphotype (subgenus Cochlio-

don or the Hypostomus cochliodon group) has a tall head

and supraoccipital crest and acute rows of few, large and

spoon-shaped teeth. The algivorous morphotype (sub-

genus Hypostomus or the Hypostomus plecostomus group)

has a depressed head and oblique rows of many, small,

villiform teeth. In contrast to bimodal Amazonian diver-

sity, Hypostomus in the Paran?a basin exhibit a broader

and more continuous range of body, jaw and tooth

shapes. In addition to both the Amazonian ecomorpho-

types, the Paran?a basin hosts many distinctive ecomor-

photypes not seen elsewhere. These include

dorsoventrally depressed species with white polka dots

on a dark base colour (e.g. Hypostomus albopunctatus,

H. roseopunctatus; Fig. 7C and F), longitudinally truncate

species with angled jaws and few but small, villiform

teeth (e.g. H. peckoltoides, H. margaritifer and H. microsto-

mus; not illustrated), and a large-finned species with a

stunning yellow-gold base colour (e.g. H. luteus; Fig. 7B).

Because some of the most distinctive yet rare Paran?a

basin Hypostomus species (e.g. H. peckoltoides) were omit-

ted from this study, our results showing an acceleration

in body shape diversification (Fig. 3) and broad morpho-

metric diversity (Fig. 6) in Paran?a River Hypostomus

likely underestimate the true diversity of this radiation.

Schluter (2000) proposed four prerequisites to adap-

tive radiation: (i) common ancestry, (ii) accelerated

diversification, (iii) phenotype–environment correlation
and (iv) trait utility. Given the monophyly and acceler-

ated diversification in species of Hypostomus of the

upper Paran?a River basin, and a consistent pattern in

other loricariid studies of correlation between pheno-

typic characters examined herein and both environment

and ecological function (Casatti &amp;amp; Castro 2006; Lujan &amp;amp;

Armbruster 2012; Lujan et al. 2012), we find the support

for adaptive radiation in Hypostomus from the upper

Paran?a River basin to be compelling. However, specific

environmental and functional data from upper Paran?a

River basin Hypostomus are still needed and are the sub-

ject of ongoing research by ourselves and collaborators.

Conclusion

There are few clear examples of evolutionary diversifica-

tion, let alone adaptive radiation, in response to

ecological opportunity either in river systems or across

continents. The most convincing examples remain those

on islands (e.g. birds and lizards, Losos &amp;amp; Ricklefs 2009),

in lakes (e.g. African cichlid fishes, Kocher 2004) or at

high mountain elevations (e.g. Andean Lupinus plants,

Hughes &amp;amp; Eastwood 2006), where relatively recent dates

of origin for entire ecosystems can be established and

rates of speciation and diversification are often striking

in an absolute sense. In contrast, the geologic and hydro-

logic history of the upper Paran?a River basin is poorly

resolved, and accelerated speciation and diversification

rates of Hypostomus are striking in a more relative sense.

The diversification of Hypostomus in the upper Paran?a

River basin has occurred over a time frame on the order

of 10–15 Myr vs. only 100 000 years for African cichlids
of Lake Victoria (reference), 1–2 Myr for Andean Lupinus
(Hughes &amp;amp; Eastwood 2006) and 5 Myr for cichlids of

Lake Malawi (reference) and Hawaiian silverswords

(Baldwin &amp;amp; Sanderson 1998). Evidence nonetheless

remains strong for a single Hypostomus lineage having

invaded the upper Paran?a River basin and experienced

accelerated cladogenesis and morphological diversifica-

tion in response. Moreover, the current and likely histor-

ical absence in the Paran?a of many competitors and

predators that are diverse and abundant in the Amazo-

nian drainages where Hypostomus first originated sug-

gests that ecological opportunity played a role in

facilitating this accelerated evolution.

Abstract
This study presents the description of a new genus of the catfish subfamily Neoplecostominae from the 
Tocantins River basin. It can be distinguished from other neoplecostomine genera by the presence of (1) 
three hypertrophied bicuspid odontodes on the lateral portion of the body (character apparently present 
in mature males); (2) a large area without odontodes around the snout; (3) a post-dorsal ridge on the cau-
dal peduncle; (4) a straight tooth series in the dentary and premaxillary rows; (5) the absence of abdominal 
plates; (6) a conspicuous series of enlarged papillae just posterior to the dentary teeth; and (7) caudal pe-
duncle ellipsoid in cross section. We used maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods to estimate a time-
calibrated tree with the published data on 116 loricariid species using one nuclear and three mitochondrial 
genes, and we used parametric biogeographic analyses (DEC and DECj models) to estimate ancestral 
geographic ranges and to infer the colonization routes of the new genus and the other neoplecostomines 
in the Tocantins River and the hydrographic systems of southeastern Brazil. Our phylogenetic results in-
dicate that the new genus and species is a sister taxon of all the other members of the Neoplecostominae, 
originating during the Eocene at 47.5 Mya (32.7–64.5 Mya 95% HPD). The present distribution of the 
new genus and other neoplecostomines may be the result of a historical connection between the drain-
age basins of the Paraguay and Paraná rivers and the Amazon basin, mainly through headwater captures.

Introduction

The Loricariidae, an endemic Neotropical family of freshwater fish, is the largest group 
of catfish, with about 900 valid species (Eschmeyer and Fong 2015). Within the Lo-
ricariidae, the subfamily Neoplecostominae has a long complex taxonomic and sys-
tematic history, with a number of major morphological and molecular studies being 
conducted since the nineteenth century (e.g. Eigenmann and Eigenmann 1890; Regan 
1904; Gosline 1947; Isbrücker 1980; Howes 1983; Schaefer 1987; Montoya-Burgos et 
al. 1998; Armbruster 2004; Chiachio et al. 2008; Roxo et al. 2012a, 2014).

The neoplecostomines are small-bodied catfishes which were, until now, restricted 
to southern and southeastern Brazil, where they are found in small- to medium-sized 
streams with clear and shallow water, of up to 1 m in depth (Langeani 1990). Previ-
ous studies (e.g. Chiachio et al. 2008; Roxo et al. 2012a, 2014) concluded that the 
considerable diversity of this subfamily can be accounted for primarily by the geomor-
phological processes (i.e. tectonics and erosion) that have shaped the South American 
continent over the past 100 Mya, influencing fish distribution and speciation patterns 
(Ribeiro 2006; Albert and Reis 2011). In this context, one of the principal processes 
is river capture (also known as stream capture or headwater capture), an important 
landscape-level mechanism that can isolate lineages and promote diversification (Wa-
ters et al. 2006; Winemiller et al. 2008; Albert and Crampton 2010) by changing the 
connectivity of adjacent river basins (Smith 1981; Hocutt and Wiley 1986; Mayden 
1988; Lundberg et al. 1998). The consequences of this process for the local fauna can 
be profound, changing watershed boundaries and allowing previously isolated species 
to disperse and colonize new environments (Grant et al. 2007; Muneepeerakul et al. 
2008; Bertuzzo et al. 2009).

Here, we recognize a new genus and species of neoplecostomine catfish based on 
specimens collected during a recent expedition to the Tocantins River basin in Goiás 
state, Brazil. The new taxon is described in detail below.

Material and methods

Morphological analysis

Body plate nomenclature follows Schaefer (1997) and measurements, Armbruster 
(2003), except for the dorsal-adipose distance, adipose-spine length, dorsal adipose-
caudal distance, ventral adipose-caudal distance, adipose-anal distance and mouth 
width. Measurements and counts were taken on the left side of the specimens and 
were taken point to point, to the nearest 0.1 mm with digital calipers. Specimens were

cleared and stained (c&amp;amp;s) according to the method of Taylor and Van Dyke (1985). 
Dorsal fin ray counts include the spinelet as the first unbranched ray. Counts of verte-
brae include the five vertebrae that comprise the Weberian apparatus, while the com-
pound caudal centrum (PU1 + U1) was counted as a single element. Zoological no-
menclature follows the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (International 
Commission on Zoological Nomenclature 1999).

Molecular analysis

Taxon sampling

The molecular analysis included 157 specimens representing 116 loricariid species 
(115 species from the study of Roxo et al. [2014], and one sample of the new genus, 
see Suppl. material 1 for all taxa). Diplomystes mesembrinus (Ringuelet, 1982) was used 
as the outgroup to root all phylogenies (Arratia 1987; de Pinna 1993, 1998; Grande 
1987; Grande and de Pinna 1998; Mo 1991; Sullivan et al. 2006). Samples of Corydo-
ras imitator Nijssen &amp;amp; Isbrücker, 1983, Corydoras oiapoquensis Nijssen, 1972, Hoplos-
ternum littorale (Hancock, 1828), Callichthys callichthys (Linnaeus, 1758), Astroblepus 
spp. 1 and 2, Hemipsilichthys gobio (Lütken, 1874), H. papillatus Pereira, Oliveira &amp;amp; 
Oyakawa, 2000, Delturus parahybae Eigenmann &amp;amp; Eigenmann, 1889b, Rineloricar-
ia lanceolata (Günther, 1868), Spatuloricaria sp. 1, Hypostomus ancistroides (Ihering, 
1911), H. nigromaculatus (Schubart 1964) and H. microstomus Weber, 1987 were also 
included in the analysis as outgroups.

Vouchers of the samples were those catalogued by Roxo et al. (2014), except for the 
samples of the new genus, which was deposited in the collection of Auburn University 
Natural History Museum (AUM), Auburn; Laboratório de Biologia e Genética de Pei-
xes (LBP), Botucatu; and Museu de Zoologia da Universidade de São Paulo (MZUSP), 
São Paulo.

DNa extraction and sequencing

Total DNA was extracted from muscle samples collected from two specimens of the 
new genus preserved in ethanol using the protocol described by Aljanabi and Mar-
tinez (1997). Partial sequences for two genes, Cytochrome B (CytB), forward 5’-CCA 
TCC AAC ATC TCA GCA TGA TGA AA 3’, reverse 5’-AAC CTC CGA TCT TCG 
GAT TAC AAG AC 3` (Oliveira et al. 2011), and 16S rRNA, forward 5’-ACG CCT 
GTT TAT CAA AAA CAT-3’, reverse 5’-CCG GTC TGA ACT CAG ATC ACG 
T-3’ (Kocher et al. 1989) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The 
amplification was conducted in a total volume of 12.5 µl with 1.25 µl of 10 X buffer 
(10 mM Tris-HCl+15 mM MgCl2), 0.5 µl of the dNTPs (200 nM of each), 0.5 µl of 
each 5 mM primer, 0.05 µl of platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), 1 µl of template 



Gabriel S. C. Silva et al.  /  ZooKeys 598: 129–157 (2016)132

DNA (12 ng), and 8.7 µl of dd H2O. The PCR reactions consisted of 30–40 cycles, 
30 s at 95 °C, 15–30 s at 48–58 °C, and 45–90 s at 72 °C. All the PCR products were 
first identified visually on a 1% agarose gel and then purified using ExoSap-IT (USB 
Corporation) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified PCR products 
were sequenced using the Big DyeTM Terminator v 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Ready Re-
action kit (Applied Biosystems), purified by ethanol precipitation and loaded into a 
3130-Genetic Analyzer automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems).

Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis

The individual sequences of each species were initially analyzed in the BioEdit 5.0.9 
software (Hall 1999), and a consensus sequence was obtained for each DNA segment. 
The sequences were then aligned in MUSCLE (Edgar 2004) using the default param-
eters, and inspected visually. To evaluate the saturation of the matrix by substitution, 
we calculated the index of substitution saturation (Iss), as described by Xia et al. (2003) 
and Xia and Lemey (2009), and the transition/transversion rate, in DAMBE 5.2.31 
(Xia and Xie 2001). The Iss was calculated without taking gaps into account.

Maximum likelihood analyses were run in RAxML Web-Servers (Stamatakis et al. 
2008). Bootstrap (BS) resampling (Felsenstein 1985) was used to evaluate the support 
for each node, based on 1000 replicates. Random starting trees were used for each 
independent ML tree search, while all other parameters were set at the default values. 
The ML analyses were based on the GTR model.

Time calibration and estimates of ancestral ranges

The uncorrelated relaxed (lognormal) molecular clock was calibrated using BEAST v.1.7.5. 
All clade-age estimates are presented as the mean and 95% highest posterior density (HPD) 
values. We included two calibration points to constrain the divergence dates for the 157 
clades identified in our phylogenetic tree. The first calibration point was implemented as a 
normally-distributed prior, with an offset of 125 million years ago (Mya), and a standard 
deviation of 15 million years. Data from the stratigraphic record and the geographic distri-
bution of living taxa indicate that the Siluriformes originated during the Lower Cretaceous 
(145–100 Mya; Lundberg 1993; Sullivan et al. 2006; Lundberg et al. 2007).

The second calibration point was implemented using a log-normal prior set at 55 
Mya, with a mean and standard deviation of 1 for the origin of the family Callichthyidae. 
The oldest known callichthyid fossil, Corydoras revelatus Cockerell (1925) was dated to 
the Paleocene by Marshall et al. (1997), assuming 55 Mya as a minimum age. We used a 
macroevolutionary Birth–Death model to estimate diversification likelihood values, with 
a starting tree obtained from the RAxML analysis. These analyses were conducted under 
the GTR model. The ML tree obtained in this analysis was used as a starting tree for the 
MCMC searches. This analysis was run for 100 million generations and sampled every

10,000th generation. Stationarity and the sufficient mixing of parameters (ESS&gt;200) 
were verified using Tracer v1.5 (Rambaut and Drummond 2007a). A consensus tree was 
built in TreeAnnotator v1.7.5 (Rambaut and Drummond 2007b).

Data on the geographic distribution of the species in each of the three subfami-
lies analyzed here (Hypoptopomatinae, Neoplecostominae and Otothyrinae) were ob-
tained from the original species descriptions and the catalog of Eschmeyer (2015), 
with the species classification following Roxo et al. (2014). Species ranges are located 
within five biogeographic regions: A, Drainage basins of the Atlantic coast of south-
eastern Brazil; B, Upper Paraná basin; C, Paraguay, Lower Paraná and Uruguay basins; 
D, Amazon and Orinoco basins; E, São Francisco basin and the coastal drainage basins 
of northeastern Brazil.

We estimated the likelihood of ancestral range evolution using the Dispersal-
Extinction-Cladogenesis (DEC: Ree and Smith 2008) and jumping (DECj: Matzke 
2013a) models of species range evolution. These models are composed of two (DEC) 
or three (DECj) parameters including: 1) dispersal (D), where ancestral ranges expand 
by adding new geographic units, 2) extinction (E), where ancestral ranges are reduced 
by extirpating geographic units, and 3) jumping events (j), where j specifies the weight 
of the jumping events beyond an ancestral range (Matzke 2014). The two models of 
range evolution (i.e. DEC and DECj) were implemented in the R package BioGeoBE-
ARS (Matzke 2013b). The global likelihood of the six biogeographic scenarios found 
using the two models (i.e. DEC and DEC+J models) were compared using the Akaike 
Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike 1973) (Suppl. material 2). The model that ob-
tained the lowest AIC values was model 2 with the DEC+J model (M2 – DEC + J), 
which constrained the dispersal rates between adjacent areas at 1.0 and areas separated 
by one or more intercalated areas at 0.5.

Etymology. The generic name is a combination of Greek, micro (mikrós) = small, 
related to the small size of the adult type-specimen, and plecostomus = a former generic 
name of species currently included in Loricariidae, also in reference to the small adult 
size of the type-species. A masculine name.

Color in alcohol. Similar to pattern described for living individuals, but with 
darker brown color, and darker saddles and stripes (Fig. 1).

Sexual dimorphism. Specimens lacking main sexual dimorphic characters usu-
ally present in loricariid species, particularly in Neoplecostominae members, such as 
(1) a papilla present posteriorly to urogenital opening; (2) an expanded flap skin on 
dorsal surface of first pelvic-fin ray; and (3) a larger pelvic-fin and body size (all charac-
ters present in males), but absent in females. Three hypertrophied bicuspid odontodes 
are present on lateral portion of body (a characteristic that may be related to mature 
males), however it is only present in holotype.

Etymology. The specific name, forestii, is given in honor of Fausto Foresti, Profes-
sor of the university of São Paulo state “Júlio de Mesquita Filho” (Unesp) in Brazil, for 
his contributions to fish genetics, with more than 250 papers published in this field.

Distribution. Microplecostomus forestii sp. n. is known from two localities, the 
Roncador Stream and the das Brancas Stream, both tributaries of the Tocantizinho 
River, in the Tocantins basin (Fig. 7a).

Habitat. Microplecostomus forestii sp. n. was collected in shallow, clear waters of 
about 0.5 m in depth and fast-flowing currents, with an underlying substrate of rock, 
in areas of flat terrain. The fishes captured were associated with pebbles (Fig. 7b, c). 
This species is relatively hard to collect and is not abundant. In seven expeditions to the 
Roncador and das Brancas streams in different periods of the year, we were able to col-
lect only 16 specimens. Microplecostomus forestii sp. n. is sympatric with species such as 
Creagrutus sp., Rhinolekos capetinga Roxo, Ochoa, Silva &amp;amp; Oliveira, 2015, Hypostomus 
sp., Phenacorhamdia sp., Ancistrus sp., and Ituglanis sp.

Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis

The sequences of all 157 specimens are shown in Suppl. material 1 (the same list of spe-
cies presented by Roxo et al. 2014, but with the inclusion of the voucher and GenBank 
accession numbers for the specimens of the newly described genus). The concatenated 
dataset resulted in a matrix of 4,102 base pairs (bps), used in all the phylogenetic and 
biogeographic analyses, of which 1,361 bps were conserved and 2,657 bps were vari-
able. There was no evidence of saturation in these data, considering that the Iss.c value 
is higher than the Iss, and the R2 value is higher than 0.8 for transitions and transver-
sions, for the concatenated matrix.

Our results are very similar to those of of Roxo et al. (2014), in particular, that the 
Hypoptopomatinae, Neoplecostominae and Otothyrinae clades are monophyletic (Figs 
8–9) with strong statistical support (BS = 99 for Hypoptopomatinae; BS = 80 for Neo-
plecostominae; BS = 84 for Otothyrinae), that the Neoplecostominae is more closely 
related to the Otothyrinae than to the Hypoptopomatinae (BS = 95), and that these two 
clades together form the sister group of the Hypoptopomatinae (BS = 96). The new ge-
nus Microplecostomus forestii sp. n. was placed in the subfamily Neoplecostominae (Fig. 
8), forming a sister group with all its members, with strong statistical support (BS = 80).

matinae and Neoplecostominae. Numbers above the branches are bootstrap values from 1000 bootstrap 
pseudoreplicates obtained from the ML analysis. Bootstrap values below 50% (-) are not shown.

Time calibrated tree and historical biogeography

Our time-calibrated tree estimated that the origin of the hypoptopomatine lineage was in 
the Paleocene, about 63.1 Mya (44.5–83.8 Mya 95% HPD), and is inferred by the DEC+J 
model to have been located in areas A (Atlantic Coast drainage basins) + D (Amazon and 
Orinoco basins) (Fig. 10 Region AD). The clade composed of the Neoplecostominae 
(Fig. 10 Region AD) + Otothyrinae (Fig. 11 Region AD) is estimated by BEAST to have 
also originated during the Paleocene, about 59.1 Mya (41.4–77.6 Mya 95% HPD), and 
once again, according to the DEC+J model, in areas A and D. Microplecostomus forestii 
sp. n. is found in the headwaters of the Tocantins River, one of the principal rivers of the 
Amazon basin (Area D). Our time-calibrated phylogeny estimated that the lineage of the 
new genus and species arose during the Eocene, 47.5 Mya (32.7–64.5 Mya 95% HPD).

Discussion

Taxonomy and phylogenetic relationship

The results of our molecular analyses indicated that Microplecostomus forestii sp. n. 
is the sister-group of all the other members of the Neoplecostominae (Fig. 8), with 
strong statistical support. Microplecostomus forestii sp. n. is distinguished from all other

neoplecostomine species by the presence of two autapomorphic characters: (1) three 
hypertrophied bicuspid odontodes on the lateral portion of the body and (2) a large 
area without odontodes around the snout, observed in all specimens. Only one (the 
holotype) of the 16 specimens analyzed presented the three hypertrophied bicuspid 
odontodes on the lateral portion of the body. We believe that this is a sexually di-
morphic character found only in large mature males, although this remains uncertain 
because the new taxon does not have any other obvious sexual dimorphism, and the 
trait is only present in the holotype, which cannot be dissected. Sexual dimorphism is 
very common in other neoplecostomines, in particular species of the genera Neople-
costomus (Langeani 1990; Zawadzki et al. 2008; Roxo et al. 2012b) and Pareiorhaphis 
(Pereira and Reis 2002; Pereira 2005). As in the present study, these species have been 
diagnosed primarily on the basis of the characteristics of the mature males.

Another character used to distinguish Microplecostomus forestii sp. n. from other 
neoplecostomines is the presence of a post-dorsal ridge on the caudal peduncle. Bock-
mann and Ribeiro (2003) were the first authors to report this character in a neople-
costomine species (Pareiorhina carrancas), and Silva et al. (2013) also reported the 
structure in a second new species of the same genus, P. hyptiorhachis. This character is 
also present in species of Corymbophanes (Armbruster et al. 2000), a genus assigned to 
the subfamily Hypostominae, which is found throughout the Potaro River in Guyana, 
northern South America. Considering that these species are not closely related (Arm-
bruster 2004; Roxo et al. 2014), the presence of a post-dorsal ridge appears to have 
arisen more than once during the evolution of these species.

The subfamily Neoplecostominae, as defined by Roxo et al. (2014), appears to be 
monophyletic and forms a sister group to the Otothyrinae, which together form a sis-
ter group to the Hypoptopomatinae (this relationship was first reported by Chiachio et 
al. 2008). The main deviation that we found from the arrangement proposed by Roxo 
et al. (2014) is in the relationship among the members of the genus Hisonotus. In the 
present study, the species H. depressicauda (Miranda Ribeiro, 1918b), H. francirochai 
(Ihering, 1928) and H. paulinus (Regan, 1908) appeared as a monophyletic group 
which includes most of the Hisonotus species found in southern Brazil, the type spe-
cies of Hisonotus (i.e. H. notatus Eigenmann &amp;amp; Eigenmann, 1889), Otothyropsis mara-
poama Ribeiro, Carvalho &amp;amp; Melo, 2005, Eurycheilichthys and Epactionotus. In Roxo 
et al. (2014) Hisonotus depressicauda, H. francirochai and H. paulinus were not closely 
related to the former species, but formed a clade with Parotocinclus and Hisonotus spe-
cies from the São Francisco River basin, albeit with reduced statistical support (see Fig. 
4 in Roxo et al. 2014).

Historical biogeography

Using the DEC model to estimate ancestral species ranges, Roxo et al. (2014) sug-
gested that the ancestral lineages of the Hypoptopomatinae, Neoplecostominae and 
Otothyrinae subfamilies (the HNO-Clade) originated on the Atlantic Coast of south-
eastern Brazil (area A, see Fig. 5 in Roxo et al. 2014). However, in a geographic area 
dominated by headwater capture events, ancestral lineages would be expected to be 
more widely distributed in adjacent hydrographic systems (see e.g. Albert et al. 2011). 
Given this, Roxo et al. (2014) did not reject the hypothesis that the ancestral lineages 
of the HNO-clade were more widely distributed in South America during the early 
Cenozoic, including much of the modern Atlantic Coast (area A), upper Paraná (area 
B), Paraguay, lower Paraná and Uruguay (area C), and Amazon and Orinoco basins 
(area D).

Our ancestral range estimates found, using the DECj model and including Micro-
plecostomus forestii sp. n. in the HNO phylogeny, that the ancestral lineages of these 
three subfamilies were widely distributed on the Atlantic Coast (area A) and in the 
Amazon and Orinoco basins (area D). While these two areas are not adjacent (i.e. they 



Description of a new catfish genus 147

do not share an endpoint or border), a number of studies have found evidence of the 
historical mixing of the faunas of the headwaters of the Amazon and Paraná rivers, and 
the drainage basins of the Atlantic Coast. The historical connection between the Para-
guay and Amazon basins has been known for more than a century (e.g. Eigenmann 
and Eigenmann 1891; Jordan 1896; Eigenmann 1906; Pearson 1937; Carvalho and 
Albert 2011; Ribeiro et al. 2013), and may account for the geodispersal (sensu Albert 
and Reis 2011) from the Amazon drainage basins (in particular the Madeira, Tocantins 
and Xingu) located on the Brazilian Shield. Even so, geodispersal events in the reverse 
direction, i.e., from south to north should also be expected (Roxo et al. 2014), and the 
dispersal of the hypoptopomatine lineages (sensu Chiachio et al. 2008) is considered 
to be the result of historical connections among the Amazon, Orinoco and Paraguay 
basins (Albert et al. 2011; Roxo et al. 2014). A number of authors have proposed 
headwater capture as the likely mechanism determining the distribution of ancestral 
fish lineages in the Tietê, Paraíba do Sul, São Francisco and Ribeira de Iguape basins on 
the Brazilian Shield (Ab’Saber 1957; Ab’Saber 1998; Ribeiro 2006; Roxo et al. 2012c; 
2014). The historical dispersal of ancestral fish lineages between areas A and D is thus 
quite conceivable.

All neoplecostomine lineages are found in southern and southeastern of South 
America, except Microplecostomus forestii sp. n. and Pareiorhaphis regani (Giltay, 1936), 
which are from the Amazon basin (area D). In a paper on the evolution of plants, Steb-
bins (1974) discussed the concepts of evolutionary museum and evolutionary cradle, 
which are used to define species occurrence patterns within an area. An evolutionary 
cradle is defined as an area of high speciation rates, while an evolutionary museum is 
an area with low extinction rates, where environmental conditions combine to preserve 
lineages over long periods of time. Roxo et al. (2014) suggested that in the Hypop-
topomatinae, the Lampiella gibbosa (Miranda Ribeiro, 1908) and Otocinclus affinis 
(Steindachner, 1877b) lineages are relicts of the Atlantic Coast drainage basins, consid-
ering that other Otocinclus species are widely distributed in the lowland Amazon and 
Paraná-Paraguay basins. The new genus and species described here, Microplecostomus 
forestii sp. n., also appears to be a relict lineage of the Tocantins River basin (Amazon 
basin), given that all other neoplecostomine species, except Pareiorhaphis regani, are 
present in the upper Paraná, lower Paraná-Paraguay, and coastal drainage basins of the 
Brazilian Shield.
