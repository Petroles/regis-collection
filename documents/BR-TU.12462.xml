“A gravidade dos desafios ambientais com que o planeta Terra se 
confronta, os quais não há como escamotear são da inteira e exclusiva 
responsabilidade da espécie humana, já não permitem abordagens 
paliativas de natureza incremental do género a que estávamos 
habituados até aqui. O tempo é pois para rupturas com as ineficazes e 
insustentáveis práticas do presente antecipando um futuro no qual o 
respeito pelo Planeta e pelas restantes espécies que nele connosco 
habitam será a regra e não a excepção.” 
 
“The severity of the environmental challenges that the Earth Planet is 
facing, which there is no concealing are the sole and exclusive 
responsibility of the human species, no longer allow palliative 
approaches to incremental nature of the kind we are used to until now. 
The time is therefore to break with the ineffective and unsustainable 
practices of this anticipating a future in which, respect for the planet 
and the other species that inhabit it with us will be the rule rather than 
the exception."

resumo 
 
 

O presente trabalho reporta detalhadamente estudos de valorização de 
resíduos sólidos industriais como matérias-primas alternativas. Todos os 
resíduos testados são classificados como não perigosos e são gerados no 
processo de produção de celulose (pasta) e papel, nomeadamente lamas 
primárias, dregs, grits, lamas de carbonato e cinzas de fundo, estas 
geradas num processo que ocorre em paralelo à produção de celulose, 
cujo objectivo é a produção de energia para abastecimento da fábrica 
através da combustão de biomassa florestal em leito fluidisado. Uma 
caracterização geral minuciosa foi realizada a cada resíduo e de acordo 
com as suas características, seleccionaram-se três aplicações em 
materiais com potencial de utilização: Fibrocimento, Mistura betuminosa 
para camada de regularização e argamassas industriais (reboco de 
projecção e cimento-cola). Após o devido enquadramento do resíduo e 
aplicação, cada resíduo foi caracterizado especificamente para que se 
procedesse a definição de formulações contendo diferentes percentuais de 
resíduos em substituição da matéria-prima convencional. Como um caso 
isolado, as cinzas de fundo foram testadas, não somente como matéria-
prima alternativa em materiais de construção, como também testou-se a 
sua reutilização em leito fluidisado no qual o resíduo é gerado. Tanto os 
dregs como as cinzas de fundo passaram por um tratamento específico 
para que fosse possível obter uma melhor qualidade do resíduo com o 
objectivo de não comprometer as características do produto final e 
processo. Os dregs foram testados em base tal e qual e lavados em 
escala laboratorial (para remoção de sais solúveis) e as cinzas de fundo 
foram lavadas em escala industrial (para remoção de sais solúveis, 
nomeadamente cloretos) e crivadas em escala laboratorial e industrial 
para eliminação da fracção grosseira do resíduo (partículas de dimensão 
superior a 1 mm). Os demais resíduos formam usados em base tal e qual, 
evitando assim custos adicionais. Os resultados obtidos em cada 
aplicação indicam potencialidades e limitações relativamente ao uso 
desses resíduos como matéria-prima alternativa, porém em alguns casos, 
as vantagens relativamente a valorização se sobrepõem às suas 
limitações, tanto nos aspectos ambientais, como económicos.

abstract 
 

This thesis reports in detail studies of industrial solid wastes valorization as 
alternative raw materials. All tested wastes are classified as non-hazardous 
and are generated in the pulp and paper process, including primary sludge, 
dregs, grits, lime mud and bottom ash (this generated in a process that 
occurs in parallel to the production of cellulose, whose aim is the production 
of energy to supply the plant through the combustion of forest biomass in 
fluidized bed). A detailed general characterization was performed at each 
waste and according to their characteristics, they were selected some 
applications in materials with potential use, specifically in Fibercement, 
Bituminous Mixture for regularization layer and industrial mortars (rendering 
mortars and cementitious-adhesive). After decided to application each 
waste was specifically tested to proceed the setting up of formulations 
containing different content of waste in replacement of the raw conventional 
material. As an isolated case, the bottom ash was tested not only as an 
alternative raw material for construction materials, but also it was tested for 
its use in fluidized bed in which the waste is generated as raw material. Both 
dregs and bottom ash had undergone special treatment to make possible to 
obtain a better quality of waste in order do not compromise the final product 
characteristics and process. The dregs were tested in bituminous mixtures 
as received and also washed (on the laboratory scale to remove soluble 
salts) and bottom ash were washed and screened in industrial scale (for 
removal of soluble salts, especially chlorides and coarse fraction particles 
elimination - particles larger than 1 mm size). The remaining residues form 
used in such as received avoiding additional costs. The results indicated 
potential and some limitations for each application to the use of these 
wastes as alternative raw material, but in some cases, the benefits in 
relation to valorization overlap with its limitations in both aspects, 
environmental and economic.

1.1  Motivation and Framework 

 Industrial development and the pursuit of higher productivity rates lead to the 

increasing consumption of natural resources and, consequently, to an increase in the 

production of waste and by-products, most of them not directly recyclable. Cellulose and 

paper mills and construction are activities that generate high environmental impacts, due to 

the high consumption of water and energy, use of large amounts of non-renewable raw 

materials and generation of wastes. 

The pulp and paper making industries are water intensive activities. Although the 

recycling of water is increasing through the adoption of closed systems, which promote the 

recirculation of process waters, the production of pulp and the manufacture of paper 

generate a considerable amount of wastewater and wastes that are purged from the process 

[Cabral et al., 1998; Thompson et al., 2001; Nurmesniemi et al., 2007]. Waste is gradually 

becoming an increasing environmental issue of concern. Achieving the European recycling 

targets defined for 2020, with the obligations about waste disposal in 2016, are the major 

environmental challenges for Southern Europe countries.  

In this work industrial wastes originated from paper pulp or cellulose production 

and associated biomass combustion processes, produced in large amounts annually, are 

characterised and then recycled in distinct construction and building materials. It is known 

that construction industry is responsible for 30% of greenhouse gases emission while is the 

biggest consumer of raw materials (approximately 3000Mt/year) [Torgal and Said, 2010]. 

Sustainability issues are obviously associated to this activity, also because the amount of 

wastes produced is very significant. Considering the large amount of quarried aggregates 

being consumed, this thesis details the recycling of several wastes, through bench, pilot 

and industrial scales, as substitutes of primary aggregates. This way the landfilling is 

avoided, while costs are minimized and demand of natural resources and extraction 

activities are also reduced. 

1.2  Objective and Structure  

The general aim of this work is to contribute to the development of wastes 

management solutions through their valorization recycling them as substitutes of natural 

aggregates widely used in building and construction activities.  

Specific objectives were defined upon the work progressing: 



Chapter 1 

4 
 

i) Identification and characterization of wastes generated in considerable 

amounts on paper pulp mill whose final destination is still the disposal on 

landfills, as well as the potential raw materials to be replaced by some of those; 

ii) Testing of selected recycling solutions, defining and assessing the formulations 

in bench scale; during this process the need for waste treatment to improve its 

performance in the final application was also considered. 

iii) After identification of an interesting waste content to be used in the final 

product tested as replacement of a primary raw material, it was verified the 

possibility of changing the test scale (from bench to industrial). It is important 

to refer that this process was limited to applications where available partners 

were identified, revealing mutual interest in implementing the potential 

solution verified in lab scale. 

iv) The exhaust sand from the fluidized bed was also tested in the own generating 

process/unit. This work was developed in pilot-scale instead of industrial due 

to the access to available facility which permitted to control the whole process 

and final product. 

v) Finally, the wastes valorization solutions in terms of advantages and 

limitations were identified and reported.   

 

The first chapter of this thesis describes the targeted industrial sectors, pulp and paper 

mill, biomass combustion technology and construction materials. This literature review 

also refers the applicable legislation about the simplified licensing of waste management 

operations, aiming to clarify the main steps to be followed considering the legal procedures 

and showing how time consuming and bureaucratic this procedure is also given, to 

exemplify how time consuming and bureaucratic this process is.. 

The experimental research that was carried out is reported in chapters 2 to 8 of this 

document. 

 Chapter 2 describes experimental facilities used to characterize the raw materials 

and the wastes tested. It also describes the general procedures used to achieve the basic 

information related with the materials and wastes aiming their adequate application. 

 Chapter 3 focuses in evaluating the use of primary sludge from kraft hardwood 

pulping process in fiber-cement sheets production at an industrial scale. In this study, 



Chapter 1

parameters such as the sludge characteristics and its quality as a raw material, 

incorporation level, the water quality in the process and the final product characteristics 

were assessed. 

 Chapter 4 describes the procedures developed to test the possibility of using pulp 

and paper inorganic wastes, namely dregs and grits, in asphalt concrete mixes as aggregate 

replacement in road regularization layers, through mix designs and specific 

characterization tests, contributing to reduce environmental effects of these wastes landfill 

disposal, which nowadays still has been their unique management solution. 

 Chapter 5 describes a detailed characterization of a rich calcium carbonate waste, 

named lime mud, generated in caustizing circuit of pulp mill process and its use as filler in 

cement-based mortars. Not only was the rheological behaviour of mortars evaluated, but 

also their properties on hardened state. 

 In chapters 6 and 7 the conventional aggregate (sand, herein named S2) used in 

industrial rendering-mortars and cementitious-adhesives was substituted by bottom ash 

produced from the forest residues biomass combustion in Bubbling Fluidised Bed 

Combustors (BFBC). The work emphasizes the biomass quality contribution in the ash 

characteristics and the need of pre-treatment procedures before substitution, namely 

screening/sieving and/or washing of waste. The environmental control of the waste was 

also evaluated aiming the characterization of the bottom ash to categorize the landfill class 

according to Decree-Law 152/2002. 

 Chapter 8 improves the knowledge on the characteristics of bottom bed waste from 

fluidized bed combustion of residual forest biomass in Portuguese thermal plants and 

cogeneration plants. Based on them, physical pre-treatment processes were applied aiming 

to regenerate the material to be reused in the bed of the bubbling fluidised bed combustor 

in pilot-scale equipment.  

Chapter 9 discusses the viability and limitations of practical implementation of some 

studied solutions, in terms of materials fluxes, consumption/substitution of 

conventional/primary resources, and industrial processing adaptations.  

Finally, the main conclusions of developed solutions are presented in chapter 10 

including suggestions for future works which could be complement the actual 

achievements, particularly in defining suitable waste management operations in order to 

achieve sustainable solutions.

1.3 Literature review 

1.3.1 Waste management  

 According to the definitions by the European Council Directive 2006/12/CE on 

Waste (EC, 1991), waste generally speaking shall mean any substance or object which the 

holder discards or intends to or is required to discard, and waste management shall mean 

the collection, transport, recovery and disposal of waste, including the supervision of such 

operations and after-care of disposal sites. In general, one fundamental aspect of the 

legislation on this question is the setting of goals for waste management [Nurmesniemi et 

al., 2007]. The Decree-Law  n.º 73/2011 from June 17th and transposes the European 

Council Directive 2008/98/CE related to solid wastes, expresses on its legislative framing, 

the prevention of wastes, promoting its reuse and recycling to aim at extending its use in 

the economy before returning to the environment in safe conditions. Besides considering 

important to promote the entire exploitation in the new organized market of wastes as a 

mean of consolidation the wastes valorization, with advantages for economic agents, as 

well as to stimulate the use of specific wastes with high potential of valorization. The 

legislation also defines requirements for substances or objects resulting from a productive 

process that can be considered as a product and not a waste. So, in a positive perspective, 

the legislation defines criteria for certain solid wastes deprive the waste status, and thus 

can become a resource. 

 According to the Decree-law n.º 178/2006, industrial wastes are those ones 

generated in industrial productive processes, as well as those resultant from activities 

related with production and distribution of electricity, gas and water. 

 The wastes recycling can represent a significant opportunity along with major 

challenges. Industrial solid wastes, such as ashes from biomass combustion, construction 

and demolition materials, lime mud, organic and inorganic sludges from wastewater 

treatment can be valuable materials for some industrial processes. Much industrial waste is 

neither hazardous nor toxic, such as waste wood fiber produced in several industrial sectors 

related to agriculture or forestry products. These by-products have many of the properties 

as the conventional materials they could replace. Putting these commodities into 

productive use could save natural resources and contribute to a sustainable future. The 

main principles of the waste management strategy in the European Union have been 

summarized as follows: 



Chapter 1 

7 
 

- Waste management hierarchy. Waste management strategies must aim to prevent 

or reduce the generation of waste and decrease its noxious nature by developing clean 

technologies. In addition, efforts must be made in order to contribute, first to the 

development and marketing of products designed to have the smallest possible impact in 

terms of pollution, if any, and secondly to the development of appropriate techniques for 

the final disposal of dangerous substances contained in waste destined for recovery. Where 

the aforementioned strategies are not possible, or fail to be environmentally and 

economically viable at the same time, waste materials should be reused, recycled or 

recovered, or used as a source of energy, provided that these practices improve or, at least, 

do not significantly decrease the quality of the final product. As a final option, waste 

should be safely disposed of, e.g., in landfill sites; 

- Self-sufficiency at the community and, if possible, at Member State level. Member 

States need to establish, in co-operation with other Member States, an integrated and 

adequate network of waste disposal facilities, taking into account geographical 

circumstances or the need for specialized installations for certain types of waste; 

- Best available techniques not entailing excessive cost.  Emissions from installations 

to the environment should be reduced as much as possible and in the most economically 

efficient way;  

- Proximity. Wastes should be disposed of as close to the source as possible, by 

means of the most appropriate methods and technologies in order to ensure a high level of 

environmental and public health protection; 

- Producer responsibility. Particularly, manufacturers have to be involved in closing 

the life cycle of their products, from production and throughout their useful life, until they 

finally become waste.  

- The principle of the protection of primary resources: it is formulated in the wider 

context of sustainable development, and it underlines the need to minimize and enhancing 

efficiency in the use of primary resources, particularly non-renewable resources, with an 

emphasis on the use of secondary raw materials. 

- The substitution principle: emphasizes the need to replace dangerous raw materials 

by non-dangerous raw materials, thus avoiding hazardous waste arising. 

1.3.2  Pulp and paper mill 



Chapter 1

 Europe hosts over nine hundred pulp and paper mills, playing an important role in a 

global perspective. The pulp and paper industry comprises companies that use wood as raw 

material and produce pulp, paper, card board and other cellulose-based products.  This 

industry is dominated by north American (United States and Canada), northern European 

(Finland, Sweden, and North-West Russia) and east Asian countries (such as East Siberian 

Russia, China, Japan, and South Korea). Australasia and Brazil also have relevant 

positions. The United States had been the world's leading producer of paper until 2009, 

when it was overtaken by China [RISI, 2011]. The pulp and paper industry is an important 

producer of solid wastes. However, there is a growing trend towards the utilization of their 

solid wastes and industrial by-products in different sectors aiming their environmental 

compatible and sustainable valorization. The difficulties found, not only in terms of viable 

applications but also related with bureaucracies, make industrial solid wastes valorization a 

challenge for producers and end users. Considerable research is being conducted 

worldwide on the use of waste materials in order to avoid an increasing toxic threat to the 

environment or to simplify present waste disposal techniques, by making them more 

reasonable [Ahmaruzzaman, 2010]. Through the increasing use of recycled paper, the 

increased degree of water treatment, more restrictive legislation and increasing costs of 

solid wastes landfill, the pulp and paper industry has been forced to place more and more 

emphasis on waste management. Often, the solid wastes from one stage of the productive 

process can be used as resource in other processes. Nurmesniemi et al (2007) exemplified 

that for the bark and wood wastes produced during the sawmilling process, which can be 

used as a raw material for particle board and chemical pulp production. Furthermore, 

thermal energy can be produced by burning wood waste from the debarking plant, black 

liquor from the pulp making process, and biosludge from wastewater treatment plants (i.e., 

activated sludge plants). In addition, the fiber sludge from pulp and paper mills, and 

therefore also called paper mill sludge [Niutanen and Korhonen, 2002], is increasingly 

being utilized in the hydraulic barrier layer of landfills. The fly ash from the biomass 

thermal power plants (nowadays, usually fluidized bed boilers) can be used as an additive 

in earthwork construction to improve soil strength and to reduce deformation, or as a forest 

fertilizer, ceramic composite, or yet as a binder replacing material in cement mortars 

[Harila and Kivilinna, 1999; Jordan et al., 2002; Mroueh and Wahström, 2002; Hytönen, 

2003; Rajamma et al., 2009]. 



Chapter 1

  Nevertheless, these and other types of solid wastes and by-products from the pulp 

and paper mills are often regarded as waste, without economic value and with inherent 

management costs, although there is an increasing interest in using them as resources. 

Makkonen et al. (2002) reported that materials which are used or that potentially could be 

utilized in several applications should not actually be classified as a waste.  

Pulping is the process of separating individual fibres from wood chips or recycled 

paper by either chemical, semichemical, or mechanical methods. The chemical process is 

the most common for wood chips. Wood handling is the first step in the pulping process. In 

this step, wood logs are debarked and cut into pieces showing manageable sizes. Wood, the 

major raw material used in the pulp and paper industry, is basically composed of cellulose 

fibres, carbohydrates such as starch and sugar, and lignin, which acts as adhesive substance 

for the cellulose fibres [Nurmesniemi et al., 2007]. Paper is essentially a sheet of fibres 

with a number of added chemicals that affect the properties and quality of the sheet. 

Besides fibres and chemicals, manufacturing of pulp and paper requires a large amount of 

process water and energy in the form of steam and electric power. Consequently, the main 

environmental issues associated with pulp and paper production are emissions to water, 

emissions to air and energy consumption [IPPC, 2001]. 

 Chemical pulping is dominated by two processes – the sulphate and the sulphite 

process. In the sulphate process, which involves alkaline digestion, the active cooking 

(digesting) chemicals are sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium sulphide (Na2S). This 

process is commonly named as Kraft method (Figure 5.1), and promotes the wood chips 

delignification into pulp for papermaking, while preserving the long fibers in the resulting 

strong pulp (composed by around 50 to 60% fibers). The sulphate or kraft process is the 

dominating pulping process worldwide, due to the superior strength properties of the 

produced pulp and its versatility to digest distinct (all) wood species. This process has 

operating interdependent units (wood storage park, cooking, laundering, thermoelectricity 

etc.) in which intermediate products are manufactured (shavings, raw pulp, bleached pulp, 

energy, etc.). 

 The pulp and paper industry is a source of a wide range of solid wastes. Nearly 

eleven million tonnes of waste are produced yearly by the European pulp and paper 

industry [Monte et al., 2009]. The amount and the composition of the solid wastes depend 

on the pulp/paper grade produced, the raw materials used, the applied processing

techniques, and the final quality/properties of the pulp/paper. Sludges (primary and 

biological/secondary) from the wastewater treatment, lime mud, lime slaker grits, dregs 

from the green liquor washing, ashes and sand from the combustion of organic components 

in co-generation units, and wood processing residues, are the main wastes produced. 

Figure 1.1 shows a scheme of the production process of bleached Kraft pulp, emphasizing 

the steps where the mentioned wastes are generated. They are better described in the 

following sections of this chapter. Under normal running conditions, wastes characteristics 

are roughly constant, excepting the sludges that might show widely variable properties, 

depending on the type of operations carried out at the mill. 

 The wastes can be reused and valorised in a safe and environmental way, 

minimizing the use of landfills as the final destination. In fact, in countries such as 

Germany, Spain and Netherlands, certain waste streams cannot be disposed of at landfill 

sites. And as it was previously stated, current legislation and increased landfilling taxes 

stimulates the search for novel management methods of such wastes, favouring reusing 

alternatives [Monte et al., 2009]. More efficient techniques to separate, collect and 

properly store some waste fractions at source can be also beneficial to meet this aim [IPPC, 

2010]. For economic and environmental reasons, chemical and semi-chemical pulp mills 

employ chemical recovery processes to reclaim spent cooking chemicals from the pulping 

process. At kraft pulp mills, spent cooking liquor, referred as “weak black liquor,” from the 

brown stock washers is routed to the chemical recovery area at kraft pulp mills. The 

chemical recovery process involves: (i) concentration of weak black liquor; (ii) combustion 

of organic compounds; (iii) reduction/elimination of inorganic compounds (dregs); and (iv) 

reconstitution of the cooking liquor. The chemical recovery process involves several steps 

that are described in the following subitems.

1.3.2.1 Chemical recovering and causticizing wastes 

 The residual weak black liquor from the digesting process is a diluted solution 

(approximately 12 to 15 percent solids of total weight) of wood lignin, organic materials, 

oxidized inorganic compounds (sodium sulphate [Na2SO4], Na2CO3), and non-reactive 

initial white liquor (Na2S and NaOH). The recovery of the black liquor starts with a 

concentration step, conducted through a series of multiple-effect evaporators (MEEs) that 

increase the solids content up to about 50 percent. At this stage the so called “strong black 

liquor” is formed. This liquor is either oxidized in the black liquor oxidation (BLO) system 

if it is further concentrated in a direct contact evaporator (DCE) or routed directly to a non-

direct contact evaporator (NDCE), also called a concentrator. Oxidation of the black liquor 

prior to evaporation in a DCE reduces emissions of odorous total reduced sulphur (TRS) 

compounds, which are stripped from the black liquor in the DCE when it contacts the hot 

flue gases from the recovery furnace. The solids content of the black liquor after the 

evaporator/concentrator typically reaches 65 to 68 percent total weight. The concentrated 

black liquor is then sprayed into the recovery furnace, where the organic components are 

combusted, and the Na2SO4 is reduced to Na2S. This process is strongly exothermic and the 

available energy is recovered as steam for process requirements, such as wood chips 

cooking, black liquor heating and evaporation, preheating of combustion air, and drying of 

pulp or paper products. Energy requirements are often supplemented by fossil fuel burning 

and/or wood firing on accessory boilers. Particulate matter (PM) (primarily Na2SO4) 

exiting the furnace with the hot flue gases is collected in an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) 

and added to the black liquor to be fired in the recovery furnace. 

 Additional makeup Na2SO4, or “saltcake,” should also be added to the black liquor 

prior to firing. Molten inorganic salts, referred to as “smelt,” are collected in a char bed at 

the bottom of the furnace. The smelt is drawn off and dissolved in water in the smelt 

dissolving tank (SDT) to form a solution of carbonate-rich salts called “green liquor,” 

which is primarily constituted by Na2S and Na2CO3. The green liquor also contains 

insoluble unburned carbon and inorganic impurities, named dregs (ELW: 030302), which 

are removed in a series of clarification tanks [Martins et al., 2007; Modolo et al., 2010; 

Mahmonoudkhani M., 2005]. 

 Decanted green liquor is transferred to the causticizing area, where the Na2CO3 is 

converted to NaOH by the addition of lime (calcium oxide [CaO]). The green liquor is first 



Chapter 1 

 

 

13 
 

transferred to a slaker tank, where CaO from the lime kiln reacts with water to form 

calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2]. 

CaO + H2O ? Ca(OH)2 + Heat [R1] 

 From the slaker, liquor flows through a series of agitation tanks, referred to as 

causticizers, that allow the causticizing reaction to go to completion (i.e., Ca(OH)2 reacts 

with Na2CO3 to form NaOH and calcium carbonate [CaCO3]). 

Ca(OH)2 + Na2CO3 ? 2NaOH + CaCO3? [R2] 

 Insoluble removed from the slakers are denominated grits (ELW: 030302). 

 The causticizing products are then routed to the white liquor clarifier, which CaCO3 

precipitates are removed, being named “lime mud (ELW: 030309)”. The lime mud is 

washed in the mud washer to remove the last traces of sodium. The washed mud is then 

dried and calcined in the lime kiln to produce “reburned” lime, which is reintroduced in to 

the slaker. The mud washer filtrate, known as weak liquor, is used in the SDT to dissolve 

the smelt. The white liquor (NaOH and Na2S) from the clarifier is recycled to the digesters 

in the pulping area of the mill. 

 In the kraft pulping and chemical recovery processes, carbon dioxide from biomass 

combustion is emitted to the atmosphere but the major part is dissolved/captured in the 

recovery furnace, forming Na2CO3 that exits in the smelt. Later on, the conversion of 

Na2CO3 into new pulping chemicals involves the transference of carbonate ions to CaCO3 

in the causticizing process. Only in the lime kiln, where CaCO3 is converted to CaO, CO2 

is released to the atmosphere [EPA, 2009c]. 

 In summary, grits, dregs and lime mud are the inorganic wastes generated in 

chemicals recovery process, being normally landfilled after dewatering (see Figure 5.1). 

1.3.2.2 Biosludges 

 The pulp and paper production is a water-intensive activity. Although the recycling 

of water is increasing through the adoption of closed systems, which promote the 

recirculation of processing water, running units generate a considerable amount of organic 

rich wastewater that is purged from the process [Nurmesniemi et al., 2007; Cabral et al., 

1998; Thompson et al., 2001]. Before discharge, the wastewater usually undergoes primary 



Chapter 1 

 

 

14 
 

and secondary treatments. The primary stage is basically a sedimentation operation that is 

runned in a clarifier tank, aiming to remove suspended solids from the effluents. It is in this 

stage where primary sludge (ELW: 030310) (Figure 1.2) is generated. This primary 

sludge is basically composed of wood fibres and inorganic impurities like sand, and 

calcium carbonate. Primary treatment can also lead to a reduction of the biological oxygen 

demand (BOD) [Nurmesniemi et al., 2007; Pöykiö et al., 2004].  

 
Figure 1. 2. Illustration of the primary effluent treatment flowsheet. 

 The secondary process is a biological treatment in which micro-organisms are used 

to reduce the amount of organic pollutants and BOD in the liquid effluent [Pöykiö et al., 

2004]. The secondary sludge consists of the microbial biomass, as well as a small fraction 

of inorganic constituents, including macro-nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) 

and micro-nutrients (iron, zinc, and other metals). 

1.3.3  Biomass heat and power plants 

 Recently, pressures on global environment and energy security have led to an 

increasing demand on renewable energy sources, and diversification of Europe’s energy 

supply. In 2010, an overall ?2200GWh of electricity was produced in Portugal from 

biomass combustion (excluding MSW and biogas) [DGEG, 2013], which corresponds to

about 4% of the gross electricity generation in the country. Of this, about 1580GWh 

corresponds to electricity produced in combined heat and power (CHP) plants running by 

units of this industrial sector, mainly using black liquors (&gt;80% of fuel feed [Patrao, 

2011]) and eucalyptus bark and the remaining 610GWh were generated in dedicated 

thermal power plants, using essentially forest residues from eucalyptus and pine plantations 

(tops, barks, branches) and agricultural by-products. Those devoted power plants represent 

?105MWe total installed capacity [Patrão, 2011; Monteiro et al., 2012; AIFF, 2009; 

Santos, 2011; APREN, 2010], and more than 50% is owned by EDP Bioelectrica [Patrão, 

2011]. The Portuguese Government objective for 2020 is an overall 250MWe of installed 

electric power  generation from forest biomass residues, in which the new dedicated plants 

will have capacities typically below 20MWe [AIFF, 2010; APREN, 2010]. 

Biofuels, or biomass-derived fuels, are widely employed nowadays. They can exert 

an important role, since are considered renewable and CO2 neutral energy resources, once 

the consumption rate is lower than the growth rate of the plants, and can potentially 

provide energy for heat, power and transports from the same installation [Pingoud &amp;amp; 

Lehtila, 1997; Tarnawski, 2004]. 

 Portugal encloses an important potential of renewable energy resources in terms of 

biomass – forest residues and wood waste. The use of biomass to energy has other 

advantages beyond the reduction on greenhouse gases from using fossil fuel combustion 

and the decrease of the external dependence on energy. Fire risks are also reduced by forest 

cleaning and removal of combustible wastes. To utilize this potential, the Portuguese 

Government, already in 1990, inquired EDP [Energy of Portugal, S.A], to implement and 

manage a thermal power plant, in which the input would be the forestry biomass residues. 

CBE (Portuguese Centre of Biomass to Energy) performed the studies and chose locations 

to implement the thermal power plant, considering regions having thick forested areas. 

Another important reason for the location choice was the number of wood industries 

nearby, namely sawmills, which produce wood residues such as bark.  

1.3.3.1 Fluidised bed combustion technology 

 At industrial scale, the available biomass combustion  technologies often evolved 

from technologies designed for coal combustion with temperatures ranging from about 

750ºC to well above 1000ºC. The widely used technologies for large-scale biomass 

combustion are stationary grates (up to 5MWth), moving/vibrating grates (many in range 



Chapter 1 

 

 

16 
 

of 20-50MWth) and fluidized beds (typically within 10-100MWth) [Larsson et al., 2010; 

Edvardsson et al., 2006]. All of them are relatively simple to operate and can use a wide 

range of fuels of varying moisture and particle sizes. These combustion systems are 

commonly used as boilers to produce steam for different purposes. The solid biomass 

combustion in fluidised bed and grate furnace is a proven technology for heat and power 

production [Ferraris et al., 2009; Yin et al., 2008]. 

 Fluidised bed combustion (FBC) has been used and widely researched due to its 

economic potential and lower environmental impact. It is adaptable for burning low-grade 

coals, biomass and organic wastes, and thereby mixtures of them [Tarelho LAC, 2001; Van 

Loo &amp;amp; Koppejan, 2008]. The fluidised bed combustion systems have been applied since 

1960 for burning municipal solid wastes and distinct industrial wastes. Since then, 

commercial installations have been built worldwide [Van Loo &amp;amp; Koppejan, 2008]. In 

Portugal, the first steps in implementing this technology were done just over the last 20 

years, to produce energy from wastes of the pulp and paper sectors (in Caima pulp and 

paper industry), and to combust tires [Tarelho LAC (2001]. Nowadays, Portugal has eleven 

plants operating with fluidised bed technology. 

 The fluidized bed combustion boiler is suitable for bark and wood residues (e.g., 

wood chips, sawdust) from wood-handling processes, as well as to burn biosludge 

generated in activated sludge plants [Harila &amp;amp; Kivilinna, 1999]. Energy generation from 

this type of biomass has been referred as sustainable and environmentally friendly 

alternative to other energy production process based on fossil fuels. The utilization of some 

of these biomass wastes as an energy source can be beneficial considering effects on 

carbon balances in ecosystems [Pingout &amp;amp; Lehtila, 1997; Tarnawski, 2004]. During 

fluidised bed combustion (FBC) the temperature has to be kept low (usually 650–900°C) in 

order to prevent ash sintering in the bed. Even so, this kind of technology presents high 

fuel conversion efficiency [McKendry, 2002; Khan et al., 2009]. This fact is also relevant 

when the environmental aspects in terms of solid wastes are considered.  

 Some problems associated with biomass combustion in FBC are related with the 

ash amount and properties, both in the thermal conversion process itself (for example, 

slagging, fouling, corrosion, bed agglomeration), and also the environmental management 

of the ashes [Rajamma et al., 2009; Werkelin et al., 2010]. There are two types of fluidised 



Chapter 1 

 

 

17 
 

bed combustion technologies, bubbling (BFB) and circulating (CFB). Figure 1. 3 presents a 

scheme of these types of FBC in terms of material fluxes.  

In the fluidised bed technology the primary combustion air enters the furnace from 

below through the air distributor and fluidizes the bed so that it becomes a seething mass of 

particles and bubbles [Mitsui Babcock Ltd., 1997; Van Loo &amp;amp; Koppejan, 2003]. In the 

BFB system, the fluidization velocity of air varies between 1.0 and 2.0 m/s, while in the 

circulating fluidised bed (CFB) this velocity changes between 5.0 to 10 m/s. Sand particles 

for CFB systems are smaller in size (0.2 to 0.4mm diameter) than those used in BFB 

boilers (0.5 to 1.0mm). This means that CFB boilers work under stronger turbulent 

regimes, what stimulates the heat transfer and assures a homogeneous temperature 

distribution [Van Loo &amp;amp; Koppejan, 2003]. 

Anyway, both types show the following attributes: high flexibility concerning 

moisture content and kind of biomass fuels; burning under a low excess of oxygen raises 

the efficiency and decreases the flue gas flow; there are no moving parts in the hot 

combustion chamber; and NOx emissions are reduced by air staging. In terms of 

disadvantages we might refer high investment and operating costs; low tolerance in 

changes of size distribution of bed particles; tendency for bed agglomeration, especially 

when burning strongly alkaline fuels; need to manage the exhaust bed particles.

1.3.3.2 Ashes from forest biomass combustion 

During biomass combustion in FBT, two main types of ashes are generated: Fly ash 

and bottom ash. Two different fly ash fractions are normally distinguished: multi-cyclone 

fly ash and filter fly ash. According to van Loo &amp;amp; Koppejan (2003), multi-cyclone fly ash 

is fine when compared with bottom ash. They are mainly composed of inorganic ash 

particles carried with the flue gas and precipitated in the secondary combustion zone, in the 

boiler and especially in multi-cyclones placed downstream the boiler. The ash fraction 

from multi-cyclone consists of coarse fly ash particles. Filter fly ash is finer than multi-

cyclone fly ash. The filter fly ash is collected in electrostatic filters, fibrous filters or is 

condensed as sludge in flue gas condensation units, normally placed downstream the multi-

cyclone. The fly ash collected during fluidised bed combustion of biomass is classified as 

industrial waste, with code 100101 according to the European List of Wastes code. 

 The bottom ash is a waste generated upon periodic bed discharges in a FBC, 

required to assure bed renovation and to avoid agglomeration and consequent 

defluidization, as well as to maintain the bed height and the suitable particle size 

distribution. Those parameters are crucial to guarantee proper hydrodynamic conditions of 

the bubbling bed. Bottom ash consists of solid coarse particles predominantly irregular in 

shape and mostly siliceous in nature (quartz) with organic impurities. They are composed 

by the sand particles fed purged from the original bed, inorganic (soil and small stones) 

components of the fed and the biomass unburnt fraction. The bottom ash generated during 

biomass combustion in fluidised bed combustion is classified as industrial waste, with code 

100124 according to the European List of Wastes. 

 According to some authors [Rajamma et al, 2009; Van Loo &amp;amp; Koppejan., 2003; 

Werther et al., 2000; Demirbas, 2005] the biomass combustion technology influences the 

amount and characteristics of the ash produced in a power plant. In grate furnaces the 

biomass ashes are subjected to higher temperatures (the maximum fuel bed temperature 

can be as high as 1000–1200 ºC) in comparison to a fluidised bed (less than 900ºC). In 

consequence, this influences the amount of organic species, several salts and heavy metals 

that volatilize in the furnace, and consequently the composition of the ashes. As already 

referred the ashes characteristics are also influenced by the biomass type and containing 

impurities, the residence time and, mainly, the bed temperature (low temperatures might 

cause incomplete burning and the amount of organic particles tend to increase in the ash). 



Chapter 1

 The siliceous nature (prevalence of quartz) of the bottom ash makes it a candidate 

to replace natural aggregates in the construction sector, replacing calibrated sand for 

instance in industrial mortars. Natural aggregate consists of manufactured crushed stone 

and sand created by crushing bedrock, or naturally occurring unconsolidated sand and 

gravel. It is a major component of the most used construction materials, such as asphalt and 

concrete [Bleischwitz and Bahn-Walkowiak, 2006]. This subitem specifies some 

environmental considerations about the construction sector, including potential impacts of 

extraction and processing of aggregates. During combustion, most of the inorganic 

nutrients and trace elements in the wood are retained in the ash [Steenari &amp;amp; Linqvist, 

1997]. Once the biomass is burned in the furnace, the heavy metals from the fuel becoming 

concentrated in the ash; the various ash fractions such as bottom ash, cyclone fly-ash, filter 

fly-ash and exit flue gas particles may contain relatively high concentrations of heavy 

metals [Narodoslawsky &amp;amp; Obernberger, 1996; Obernberger et al., 1997; Fujimori et al., 

2004].  Generally, biomass ashes are composed of the biomass nutrients, as for example 

Ca, K, Na, Si and P. In case of wood biomass, the alkali metals content is high compared to 

silicon content (i.e., rice husks) [Thy et al., 2006; Masia et al., 2007].  

1.3.4 Construction materials as a waste management solution 

 Worldwide, the construction industry consumes more raw materials (around 3000 

Mt/year, almost 50% in mass) than any other economic activity, which shows its potential 

to become an unsustainable activity [Torgal e Jalali, 2010]. The Council International 

Building (CIB) defined in 1994 the 7 principles for sustainable construction, whose first 

two are described as the "Decreasing consumption of resources" and “Reuse of the 

resources” [Kibert, 2008]. 

 Every year more than 1m3 of concrete is produced per person worldwide [Scrivener 

and Kirkpatrick, 2008] with Portland cement being the key ingredient, but producing the 

greatest environmental burden. Presently around 3 billion tons of Portland cement are 

consumed worldwide [Zampini, 2009] and for the production of every 1 ton of cement, 

approximately 800 kg of carbon dioxide is released [Ban and Ramli, 2011], around 5–8% 

of all manmade CO2 [Flatt et al., 2012]. While cement production is still based on the 

Ordinary Portland type (OPC), in the last few decades several other types started to be 

produced using supplementary cementitious materials to partially replace the clinker [Ali et 



Chapter 1 

 

 

20 
 

al., 2008]. Anyway, in concrete and alphalt formulations the aggregates correspond to the 

highest volume fraction. Ready-mixed concrete is made of up to 80% aggregates, while 

pre-cast products and asphalt might contain 95% aggregates [Bleischwitz and Bahn-

Walkowiak, 2006]. The environmental impacts caused by aggregates extraction and 

processing include changes in the landscape, noise due to vehicle movements from the pit 

or quarry, dust, vibrations from blasting, and degradation of groundwater and surface 

water. In that sense, the use of alternative supplementary materials might assure the 

following benefits: (1) reduction of the consumption of non-renewable natural resources; 

(2) reduction of energy consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases; (3) landfilling 

reduction [Frederico and Chidiac, 2009]. 

 To design effective recycling solutions it is desirable to combine multidisciplinary 

skills. The properties of the raw materials and how they affect the behaviour of the final 

products, such as mortars, fibercement, bricks, etc, should be known. Chemical and 

physical characteristics need to be defined, while determination of effects on the 

mechanical performance and durability of the products is a crucial requirement to estimate 

the viability of the suggested recycling route. But at the same time, environmental issues 

need to be accomplished. 

 Next paragraphs will describe some examples of the use of wastes as replacement 

material in several types of construction materials. The use of pozzolanic wastes or by-

products in mortar formulations goes back a few thousand years ago. The Thera volcano 

eruption in 1500 BC, which destroyed part of the island Santorini, was responsible for the 

appearance of vast amounts of ash which were used by Greek civilization in mortar 

formulations. The pozzolanic reactivity is the ability of the material to chemically combine 

with the calcium hydroxide. It is a complex property that depends on the chemical 

composition of the material, namely their silica and alumina contents, on the (low) degree 

of crystallinity, and on the particle size distribution [Gjorv, 1992; Liu, 1998]. 

In the cement industry both the material and energy contents contained in certain 

pulp and paper residues can be recovered. Sludges from primary clarifiers (or mixed with 

sludge from biological treatment) might be used as clinker components [Ahmadi and Al-

Khaja, 2001; Cernec et al., 2005]. However, its suitability depends on the amount and type 

of inorganic compounds present in the material. The primary sludge is collected in a wet 

condition (about 50% moisture content) and need to be dried before addition to the clinker 



Chapter 1 

 

 

21 
 

meal. Existing pre-dryers on the cement kilns might be used to reduce the moisture content 

down to 10–15%. Thus, when burning the dried sludge in the cement rotary kilns, the 

calorific value of the organic substances will reduce energy requirements in the calcination 

stage. The resulting ash will then compose the clinker [IPPC, 2001].  

Ravina (1997) researched the utilization of large quantities of Class F fly ash of 

marginal quality in structural concrete as partial fine sand replacement. He studied the 

effect of such replacement on the properties of fresh [Ravina, 1997] and hardened [Ravina, 

1998] concrete. Results showed beneficial effects on the workability and on the 

compressive strength of structural concrete and, while elasticity modulus was improved. 

The fineness of the ash explained that behaviour, since compactness was improved.  

Andiç et al (2005) investigated the effect of low-lime fly ash (conforming to 

relevant Turkish standard) on the mechanical properties of tile adhesives. Formulations 

were prepared by partially substituting cement or sand by the waste. Cement replacement 

by fly ash in all levels (from 5 to 25%wt) induces reduction on the flexural and 

compressive strength in all studied ages. By contrast, ash for sand substitution, at 

percentages up to 10 wt%, did not affect much the tensile adhesion strength of the material. 

A good correlation between changes on the tensile adhesion, flexural and compressive 

strength values and fly ash for cement replacement content was observed.  

Andrade et al (2009) discussed through experimental results, the influence of the 

use of coal bottom ash as a replacement for natural fine aggregates on some properties of 

concrete. They studied the influence of the bottom ash porosity on the potential water 

absorption and water loss of the material, as well as on the water consumption of concretes 

produced with bottom ash. The results showed that in the fresh state the concretes 

produced with the bottom ash are susceptible to water loss by bleeding and the higher the 

percentage of bottom ash used as a natural sand replacement the lower the deformation 

through plastic shrinkage. The results also showed that the setting time is affected by the 

presence of bottom ash in the concrete. This study concluded that different forms of bottom 

ash mix result in concretes with different properties in the fresh state, but the behavioural 

tendencies are maintained when bottom ash is employed as a replacement for natural 

aggregates. 

 Typically, ashes from biomass combustion have more alkali (i.e. Na and K) and 

less alumina than coal ashes [Llorente and Garcia, (2006); Thy et al., 2006]. According to 



Chapter 1 

 

 

22 
 

Etiegni (1990) wood ash in Europe had been used as a feedstock in the manufacture of 

Portland cement. Almost ten years later, Naik (1999) reported that wood ash had a 

substantial potential for use as a pozzolanic mineral admixture and activator in cement-

based materials. He further indicated that wood ash has significant potential for use in 

numerous other materials including controlled low strength materials (CLSMs), low- and 

medium-strength concrete, masonry products, role compacted concrete pavements, 

materials for road base, and blended cements. Due to high carbon content in wood ash, its 

use is limited to low- and medium-strength concrete materials [Siddique, 2012].  

 Rajamma et al. (2009) studied the incorporation of fly ashes from forest biomass 

combustion in cement based formulations. They figured out that this type of biomass is 

similar to class C fly ash to EN 450 on the basis of chemical composition and concluded 

that up to 20% fly ash could be incorporated as cement replacement in cement-based 

mortars in order to maintain an acceptable mechanical strength. As well, Ramos et al. 

(2013) evaluated a wood waste ash (WWA) in mortar as a partial cement replacement 

material to ascertain applicability in cement-mortars. They developed an extensive 

experimental program carried out on mortar containing this ash to assess strength and 

durability parameters (carbonation and alkali-silica-reaction) and concluded that WWA 

seems to be a promising pozzolanic material for partial substitution of cement (20%wt), 

with no strength loss while enhancing the durability and thus contributing to sustainable 

construction. 

 According to Sale and Lima (2010) many types of ash do not have hydraulic or 

pozzolanic reactivity, but can be used in civil construction as inert materials. Based on the 

physicochemical characterization of sugarcane bagasse ash (SBA - bottom and fly ash), 

mortars and concretes were produced by using such waste as sand replacement (between 

10 and 100%wt sand replacement). They observed that SBA can be recommended as 

replacement of fine aggregate for the manufacture of artefacts and ordinary structures. 

SBA can be used as a partial substitute of sand in concretes made with cement slag-

modified Portland cement for structures requiring strength values up to 30 MPa.  

 Garcia and Sousa-Coutinho (2013) tried to assess the effects of using ground 

bottom ash (GWA) as cement replacement in mortars. The non-pozzolanic character of the 

waste did not contribute to improve the mortar durability, so the material may be used as

filler in cement-based formulations providing marginal durability loss and improving 

strength at later ages. 

 In bricks production, the addition of 5–15% of paper sludge as raw material will 

improve the porosity of the fired matrix, then reducing the weight and improving the 

thermal insulation. Heat released due to burning of organic components will save energy 

upon firing. The product tends to be more resistant to cracking during drying and firing 

stages, but mechanical resistance diminished [Cernec and Zule, 2005; Cernec et al., 2005]. 

 Demir (2005) investigated the potential utilization of wastes from kraft pulp 

production, namely sludge basically composed by short cellulose fibers (primary sludge), 

in clay bricks. Results were somewhat similar to the ones previously reported: up to 5 wt% 

addition, an effective pore forming effect was observed in the clay bodies, while the 

mechanical properties are acceptable. The control of extrusion conditions of green bodies 

is also easily achieved, by increasing the water content in the mixture to adjust the 

plasticity level. 

1.4 Legal Procedures 

There is a clear need for guidelines to a sustainable management of solid wastes in 

order to enhance and to establish practices of correct management of these by-products. 

For that, it seems important to characterize for knowing and controlling these wastes 

properties and qualities focusing on their application/recycling as alternative to landfilling, 

thus saving natural resources as well. Some aspects related with bureaucratic process 

(licenses, dispatch notes, charters etc) many times subject the all process that occurs from 

industrial preliminary tests until the solution implementation. In Portugal, at least three 

entities are involved in the request of simplified licensing process for waste management: 

the applicant, the Commission of Coordination and Regional Development (CCDRs) and 

ANR (Wastes National Authority). The standard procedure for simplified licensing of 

waste management operations in Portugal includes procedures defined in the following 

legislation.  

Decree-Law n.º 178/2006, September 5th (Defines the general polices for waste 

management and applies to waste management operations, including any transaction 

collection, transportation, storage, category, treatment, recovery and disposal of waste and 



Chapter 1 

 

 

24 
 

the decontamination of soils and monitoring of disposal sites following the closure of their 

premises). 

Ordinance n.º 1023/2006, September 20th - Indicates the elements that constitute 

the simplified licensing request. 

Ordinance n.º 50/2007, January 09th - Presents the template of license for carry 

out waste management operations.  

Ordinance n.º 209/2004, March 03rd - The European Wastes List (Decree-Law 

n.º 237/97, contained in this ordinance ensures harmonization of regulatory prevailing in 

the identification and classification of residues while facilitating a perfect knowledge by 

economic agents of the legal system to which they are subject. 

1.4.1 Main Steps of simplified licensing process 

 Portugal has a specific standard which goal is to clarify and systematize the 

organization of simplified procedures for licensing waste management operations 

coordinated by CCDR, under the writing and flow chart form – steps, content and 

responsible conduct of these processes simplified licensing, according to the legislation 

above referred. This standard shall govern the relations between CCDR, the applicants and 

ANR in these processes and it should be systematically applied to all cases of this type in 

which the Commission of Coordination and Regional Development – Lisbon - Tejo Valley 

(CCDR-LVT) will be involved. Figure 1.4 illustrates a simplified scheme numbering the 

three main steps present in the whole process of simplified licensing of wastes 

management operations related with storage, separation, treatment, valorization and 

elimination. This scheme is detailed in figure 1.5 where the systematization of the main 

steps related with the process phases necessary to obtain the license are indicated.

from submission of the request until  of the process this is very time consuming and 

bureaucratic. Consequently, this quite complex procedure often can lead the applicant to 

withdraw the request, even when it is recognised that the economic benefits of the waste 

management operation surplus the cost involved in all the licensing request process.

2 EXPERIMENTAL WORK 





Chapter 2 

31 
 

 This work was planned considering three stages of development: bench scale tests, 

pilot-experiments and industrial applications. The bench scale was considered for all 

wastes and applications. Tests were developed first with a general characterization wastes 

and raw materials, in terms of physical, chemical and mineralogical properties. Then 

samples were produced and characterised, aiming to optimize the relevant properties. 

Considering applications for which large-scale experimental facilities were available, in a 

tentative of testing process adaptations for real solutions. 

2.1  Experimental Methods 

2.1.1 Physical characterization 

 To determine the water content of the solid samples they were dried to constant 

mass during at least 24h in an oven at 105ºC ± 5. The water content was generally 

expressed in total weight percent (EN 12880:2000; Characterization of sludges – 

Determination of dry residue and water content). The particle density and water absorption 

was determined for some solid wastes and raw-materials using the standard NP EN 1097-6: 

2003; the method was used to determine the density of the foundation soil, solid waste and 

their mixtures, but also to understand changes occurring during modification of the 

components of a material. For density determination, the mass of sample was taken after 

being dried, and the volume is determined by the weight of the volume of water displaced 

by the dry particles in a known volume of the picnometer; the volumic mass was 

determined by the expression below:  

? =
(?? ? ?1)

	(?? ? ?
) ? (?? ? ??)
  

Where: 

M1 – picnometer mass (g) 

M2 - picnometer and water masses (g); 

M3 – picnometer and dry sample masses (g); 

M4 – picnometer, saturated sample and water masses (g). 

 

 The particle size distribution of materials was determined by using two techniques: 
 



Chapter 2 

32 
 

i) Sieving 
 

The manual sieving was performed according to NP EN 933-1:2000. The used sieves 

were comprehended between 25 mm and 0.63 mm. Before sieving, materials were dried at 

105ºC to remove the moisture and then to prevent the agglomeration of fine particles and 

clogging of the sieves. The mass used was adjusted according to the particle size 

characteristics of the material. The amount retained in different sieves was weighed. 

ii) Laser diffraction particle size analyzer 

 The particle size distribution of fly ashes (below 1mm) was determined on a 

Coulter LS 230 (Coulter Electronics, Krefeld, Germany) apparatus, equipped with PIDS 

(Polarization Intensity Differential Scattering). The Coulter consists of a vessel where the 

particles are dispersed in a fluid. This suspension is forced through a small opening where 

existing electrodes will impose an electric current. When a particle passes through the 

opening, there is a disturbance in the electrical current, corresponding to a sudden increase 

of resistance. This change is directly related with the volume of the particles, which allows 

the determination of the size distribution and the mean value [Ferraris et al., 2004]. The 

Coulter LS 230 uses a laser of 750 nm and double Fourier lens for focusing the scattered 

light on the ring-shaped detector setup. The detection range (angles) for diffraction is 

claimed to be 40 nm – 2000 µ m, thus theoretically covering the desirable size range. 

 The specific surface area was determined by nitrogen adsorption using a specific 

method developed by Brunnauer, Emmett and Teller, which is called by the BET method 

[Brunauer et al. 1938]. The equipment used was a Micromeritics Instrument Corporation 

model, Gemini 2380, working at a pressure of 763 mmHg 

2.1.2 Chemical and mineralogical characterization 

 Thermal gravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TG/DTA) were performed 

up to 1000ºC/1200ºC with a heating rate of 10 ºC/min, in a simultaneous TG/DTA (STA 

409 EP) apparatus. The data were analyzed with software programs supplied by the 

instrument. The thermo gravimetric curve was corrected for buoyancy effect, while the 

differential thermal analysis curve was corrected for baseline effect. Adjustments for 

buoyancy and baseline effects were acquired in a blank run using empty crucibles.  



Chapter 2 

33 
 

 Thermal gravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) were performed 

up to 1000ºC/1200ºC with a heating rate of 10 ºC/min, in a simultaneous TG/DTA (STA 

409 EP). The data were analyzed with software programs supplied by the instrument. The 

thermo gravimetric (TG) curve was corrected for buoyancy effect and the differential 

thermal analysis (DTA) curve was corrected for baseline effect. Adjustments for buoyancy 

and baseline effects were acquired in a blank run using empty crucibles which were later 

used to run the sample in a second run, but the two experimental runs were made under 

identical conditions. 

 The chlorides content of certain solid wastes was determined by the Argentometric 

method (CHLORIDE, 4500-Cl-; Standard Methods Committee, 1997). In order to prepare 

the samples for the analysis, 100 g of dried material is dissolved in 1 liter of distilled water, 

while suspension is then stirred for 24 hours. Then, 100 mL of filtered solution are titrated. 

Chlorides are titrated with a silver nitrate solution in the presence of chromate anions. The 

end point is denoted by the appearance of a red colour corresponding to the formation of 

silver nitrate. By decreasing the pH value, silver chromate solubility grows up due to the 

protonation of chromate anions, while at high pH values silver reacts with hydroxide 

anions and precipitates as AgOH and Ag2O. Both reactions interfere with the determination 

accuracy. So the pH of the solution is reduced to 7 by adding sulphuric acid. Potassium 

chromate solution is used as indicator, to create a slightly yellow colouration. It was 

titrated against 0.0141M silver nitrate. At the end of the chloride precipitation as white 

silver chloride, the first excess of titrate precipitates as silver chromate, which signals the 

end point. Corresponding reaction are given below. 

Ag + Cl ? AgCl (s) [R5] 

2Ag + CrO4 ? Ag2CrO4 (s) [R6] 

 By knowing the stoichiometry and moles consumed at the end point, the 

amount of chlorides in an unknown sample can be determined. 

 The chloride content on mortars (see chapters 6 and 7) was determined according to 

EN 1015-17:2000 (Determination of water-soluble chloride content of mortars). Ten grams 

of material was milled (&amp;lt;150 µ m) and dissolved in 100 mL HNO3 solution (10% w/w), by 

boiling for 15 minutes. After this, the sample was filtered and washed with hot distilled 

water until complete 500 mL of solution. The chloride content was determined by 



Chapter 2 

34 
 

potenciometry using a selective ionic electrode (Consort, model C860) in 50 mL of the 

final solution. 

 The sulphate content was determined by gravimetry (SULFATE, 4500-SO4-2; 

ignition of residue, Standard Methods Committee, 1997). Samples were dried, weighed and 

dissolved in diluted HCl. Barium chloride solution was added in excess to precipitate 

barium sulphate, and the precipitate was digested in the hot solution (between 80 – 90ºC). 

The precipitate was filtered through a filter paper which was then ignited (at 800 ºC for 4 

hours) and completely combusted. Weight ratio between precipitate and initial sample 

amounts corresponds to the sulphate %. The precipitation reaction is described by equation 

R7. 

Ba2+ (ag) + SO4
2- (ag) ? BaSO4 (s) [R7] 

 Crystalline phases or mineralogy of the materials were detected by X-ray 

diffraction on a RIGAKU-Geigerflex X-ray diffractometer. Analysis was performed under 

40 kV/30 mA, and scan mode continuous/speed-2? (min-1). A C Series; CuK? radiation is 

used and the angle range 2? was 10º - 80º.  

 The chemical characterization of the samples was performed for major and minor 

chemical elements by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), using a Panalytical Axios spectrometer. 

Prior to analysis, the samples were subjected to a grinding process in an Agatha mill, 

followed by drying at 101 ºC ± 1 ºC for at least 12 hours. The chemical analysis was 

performed considering: i) Loss on ignition (LOI), and ii) XRF analysis on a pressed pellet 

previously prepared. For LOI determination, approximately 1.5 grams of the sample, 

milled and dried, were heated to 1100 ºC for 3 hours in a Carbolite furnace; the LOI was 

obtained based on the loss of weight after the heating at 1100 ºC. 

 The samples morphology was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy - Energy 

Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), using an ultra-high resolution analytical scanning 

electron microscope HR-FESEM Hitachi SU-70. Optical microscopy analysis was 

developed by microscope V (Leica EZ4 HD).  

 These techniques required powder as samples for analysis. To enable the 

application the samples were dried and milled (700 rpm/ 5 minutes) in a fast agate mill 

until a thin powder to be obtained before testing. 

2.1.3 Sample characterization methods for specific applications 



Chapter 2 

35 
 

Application in fibercement production (Chapter 3) 

The Schopper-Riegler test is designed to measure the rate of drainage of a diluted 

pulp suspension. The drainage rate is related to the surface conditions and swelling of the 

fibers. It is widely used to track the changes in the drainage rate of various chemical pulps 

during beating and refining. In principle, this method is applicable to all kinds of pulp in 

aqueous suspension. However, in practice, the Schopper-Riegler test provides acceptable 

results only if a sufficiently dense mat of fibres is formed on the wire screen. For this 

reason, the test is not recommended for some extremely short-fibred pulps, such as those 

obtained from well-beaten hardwoods, as most of the fibres will pass through the wire 

screen, resulting in anomalous reduction of the SR number. The most reliable results are 

obtained within the range of 10 to 90 SR number. The SR/Pneumatic used in this study is 

used for the determination of drainability of pulp suspension in water. The drainability is 

the measurable index of the refining degree of pulps. The refining of pulps is one of the 

most important stages in the paper production process and strongly determines the sheet 

forming process and then the physical properties of resulting material. In this specific case, 

fiber-cement sheets were considered (ISO 5267/1:1999 – Pulps: Determination of 

drainability - Part 1: Schopper-Riegler method). Some testing characteristics include: speed 

of sealing cone = 100 ±10 mm/s; calibrated bottom orifice = 149.0 ±1.0 s for 1litre of H2O 

drainage chamber volume = 1000 mL; drainage area = 100 cm2; pneumatic driving 

pressure = 2.0 kgf/cm2; measuring scales = 0-100 SR; resolution = 1 SR; air supply = 2 

kgf/cm2; and air consumption = 0.1 m3/h. 

Application in bituminous mixes (Chapter 4) 

Two techniques were applied to determine the concentration of fine particles, here 

considered as impurities since they are basically constituted by the unwanted clay fraction, 

in the aggregates used as raw-materials for bituminous mixes: Methylene-blue (MB) and 

Sand equivalent (Se). The tests were developed according to NP EN 933-9: 2000 and NP 

EN 933-8: 2000, respectively. In summary, the MB technique involves the determination 

of adsorption of such dye by a defined amount of aggregate particles. Increments of a 

solution of methylene-blue are successively added to a water suspension containing the test 

specimen. The adsorption of the methylene-blue solution by the sample is verified by 



Chapter 2 

36 
 

conducting test spots on filter-paper to detect the presence of free methylene-blue visually, 

recognized by the presence of a halo on the spot (Figure 2.1). The volume of MB solution 

used to titration is registered and the results are expressed in grams of adsorbed MB per 

kilogram of sieved fraction assayed. 

In the sand equivalent test, a sample of aggregate passing through 4.75 mm sieve 

and a small amount of flocculating solution are poured into a graduated cylinder and are 

agitated to remove the clay-like fine particles that might be present in the batch. The 

sample is then irrigated with additional flocculation solution to assure the complete 

removal of such clay-like fraction. After a prescribed sedimentation period (the complete 

test procedure is described in NP EN 933-9:2000), the height of flocculated clay fraction 

and the sand mass are determined. This ratio gives the sand equivalent value, and higher 

values correspond to a “cleaner” aggregate material.

2.2  Pilot scale combustion facility 

 The biomass combustion experiments were performed in a pilot-scale facility 

including a 30kWth fluidized bed combustor (Figure 2.1). A detailed description of the 



Chapter 2 

37 
 

experimental work developed in this facility is presented in Chapter 8 of this thesis, 

including the set of operating conditions as well as the specific experimental procedures 

used during the combustion experiments. More detailed information about the pilot-scale 

infrastructure can be found in several published works [Tarelho, 2001; Tarelho et al., 2004; 

Tarelho et al., 2005; Tarelho et al., 2011].  

 This pilot-scale combustion facility can be divided into three main systems: the 

fluidized bed combustor, the gas sampling and analysis, and the control and data 

acquisition. The combustion reactor is a thermally insulated bubbling fluidized bed (AISI 

310 Stainless Steel) with overall dimensions of 0.25 m intern diameter and 3 m height. The 

reactor has a bed of silica sand (250 µm – 710 µm particles) with a static bed height of 0.23 

m, supported on a nozzle-type distributor for the primary combustion air injection as 

fluidizing agent, nine ports for gas sampling probes and for monitoring pressure and 

temperature along the reactor height (three of which inside the bed), ports for 

charging/discharging of bed solids, as well as specific ports accommodating a variety of 

devices: an auxiliary gas burner, a zirconia cell for in-situ O2 monitoring, a port for the fuel 

feeding, a port for the secondary combustion air supply, and water-cooled heat-exchangers. 

The biomass fuel is fed to the reactor by a screw-feeder located on top of the freeboard and 

falls down through a vertical stainless steel tube and is discharged at bed surface. This 

vertical tube also permits to inject the secondary air together with the fuel. The freeboard 

temperature is controlled by a water-cooled heat exchanger wound around the vertical fuel 

feeding tube. In turns, the bed temperature is controlled by eight radial water-cooled probes 

inserted into the bed. The fuel feeding system is calibrated manually by means of a scale 

for each type of biomass to be used as fuel. Also integrated in the bottom part of the reactor 

and located upstream of the primary air distributor plate (that is, in the wind-box) it is 

located an electrical element intended to be used for heating the primary combustion air 

during the start-up procedure of the reactor.

University of Aveiro, Portugal).  

The pneumatic circuits for controlling the various gas streams entering the fluidized bed 

reactor (e.g. combustion air, N2 purging gas, propane for the start-up gas burner) make use 

of solenoid valves to be able to operate the system either in an automatic or manual mode. 



Chapter 2 

39 
 

The gas sampling and analysis system comprises a series of water-cooled probes, suitable 

pneumatic lines integrating gas conditioning units and a PTFE diaphragm pump, a set of 

online gas analyzers (for example for O2, CO2, CO, NO), as well as pressure sensors and 

thermocouples (K-type). The water-cooled gas sampling probes are inserted into the 

abovementioned sampling ports located at several positions along the reactor height, each 

one equipped with a K-type thermocouple, a plug filter at the tip located inside the 

combustor chamber for removing particles, and a condenser located at the rear part of the 

probe for removing water and heavy hydrocarbons. There is also a heated probe and 

sampling line (180ºC) inserted into the freeboard through the reactor top flange for hot gas 

sampling for total hydrocarbons quantification. The pneumatic circuits are integrated into 

automatic gas control and distribution units which permit to selected a specific probe for 

sampling gases and turn the online gas analyzers into service in a controlled way. The 

experimental system is controlled by a computer based data acquisition and control system. 

The experimental data collected during each experiment run was recorded by the data 

acquisition system for subsequent analysis. 

 

2.3  Industrial scale test 

Twenty five tons of bottom ash from forest biomass combustion in an industrial 

bubbling fluidized bed combustor (BFBC) at a pulp and paper mill were treated by washing 

and sieving (&amp;lt;1000µ m) at an industrial facility (dealing with treatment of raw material for 

the construction sector, namely, prepares natural sand as aggregate for the construction 

industry). The goal was to make the treatment of the bottom ash in order to be used as 

recycled material in substitution to conventional raw material in industrial mortars 

(Chapters 6 and 7). With this industrial test, it was possible also to evaluate the efficiency 

the washing and sieving treatment process, considering the process conditions. In Figure 2.2 

it is shown the macroscopic aspect of the raw bottom ash, the layout of the industrial 

installation where the treatment of the bottom ash was done and respective process steps. 

The bottom ash from forest biomass combustion in an industrial bubbling fluidized 

bed combustor (BFBC) was transported from the pulp and paper mill to the treatment 

installation and stored for 24 hours before test. The bottom ash treatment was performed in 

a continuous way in the industrial plant, and included a continuous shower using an 

Liquid/Solid (L/S) ratio equal to 2, and has a processing capacity of 10 ton/h; the washing 



Chapter 2 

40 
 

solution is treated by sedimentation in order to be reused in further washing cycles, in this 

way maximizing the use of water resources. 

The physical, chemical and mineralogical characterization of the solid wastes 

previously to the specific valorization as replacement material led to select some interesting 

alternatives for these wastes valorization.  However, many other specific characterization 

and its results are presented and evaluated in detail in the next seven chapters of this 

document.

Abstract 

Sustainable waste management system for effluents treatment sludge has been a pressing 

issue for pulp and paper sector. Recycling is always recommended in terms of 

environmental sustainability. Following an approach of waste valorisation, this work aims 

to demonstrate the technical viability of producing fiber-cement roof sheets incorporating 

cellulose primary sludge generated on paper and pulp mills.  

From the results obtained with preliminary studies it was possible to verify the possibility 

of producing fiber-cement sheets by replacing 25% of the conventional used virgin long 

fiber by primary effluent treatment cellulose sludge. This amount of incorporation was 

tested on an industrial scale. Environmental parameters related to water and waste, as well 

as tests for checking the quality of the final product was performed. These control 

parameters involved total solids in suspension, dissolved salts, chlorides, sulphates, COD, 

metals content. In the product, parameters like moisture, density and strength were 

controlled. The results showed that it is possible to replace the virgin long fibers pulp by 

primary sludge without impacts in final product characteristics and on the environment. 

This work ensures the elimination of significant waste amounts, which are nowadays sent 

to landfill, as well as reduces costs associated with the standard raw materials use in the 

fiber-cement industrial sector.

3.1  Introduction 

 Sustainability concept is becoming increasingly important for several industrial 

sectors, including the paper and pulp sector as well as the building sector, because they 

present a strong impact as important economical activities [Lopes et al., 2003]. The waste 

management is becoming a priority and the building sector is one of the most useful sectors 

for diverse applications, in order to close with value the life cycle of certain products.  

 The use of industrial waste and by-product materials is widely recognized as one of 

the major preferred options towards the achievement of sustainable development. The 

prevailing environment policies require the waste to be treated before going to landfill. 

Treating waste and valuing them as raw materials for construction or other ends is more 

sustainable, particularly, when wastes are already on site [Snelson et al., 2009]. 

 A pulp and paper mill generates, in all stages of process production, large amounts 

of solid wastes differing greatly in composition and moisture content. In its fiber 

production line, the screening equipment discharges uncooked material from the digester 

and smaller screening rejects. The chemical recovery cycle produces mainly inorganic 

material (called dregs and grits), energy production in the biomass boiler giving, as solid 

waste, fly ash and purged sand in the case of bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) boilers and, 

finally, also sludges coming from effluent treatment plant, classified as primary and 

biological sludges according to their treatment procedure. 

 Indeed, wastewater treatment plant is the biggest solid waste producer, generating 

two types of sludges, primary and biological. Primary sludge is mainly composed of fiber, 

lost in different equipments along the fiber line and settled in primary effluents treatment 

area. It also contains inorganic suspended solids, mainly calcium carbonate from the 

caustic area. These solids are also decanted and become a primary sludge constituent. On 

integrated pulp and paper mills this type of sludge has a much higher content of inorganic 

fractions, as a consequence of the precipitated calcium carbonate used as filler in paper 

production and in paper machine white water excess.  

 Biological sludge comes from the biological treatment unit and it contains 

microorganisms. This unit generally involves activated sludge reactors and sludges are 

obtained through secondary decanters, sludges thickeners and final belt press dewatering. 

Wastes from pulp and paper industry are usually managed, in terms of waste disposal, 

using several approaches including landfills, incineration, recycling in cement or ceramics

plants, lightweight aggregates, asphalt, agriculture, anaerobic treatment, and others [United 

Nations Economic and Social Council, 2001; Hassini et al., 2005; Demir et al., 2005; Huet, 

1982; Shao et al., 2001; IZF, 1994; Podobnik and Zule, 2006; Krigstin and Sain, 2006; 

Monte et al., 2009; Lynde et al., 1997]. Wastewater sludges were already used in different 

sectors and the main applications are associated to agricultural purposes, biomass, 

incorporation in clay bricks, lightweight aggregates and in moulded gypsum cardboards 

production [Modolo et al., 2007; United Nations Economic and Social Council, 2001; 

Demir et al., 2005].  

 Considering the large amount generation of primary sludge production and its 

fibrous nature, this work attempts to develop a solution to add value to this material 

incorporating in a construction material where their fibrous nature could be advantageous. 

For that, preliminary studies were developed at a laboratory level in a base composition 

used in fiber-cement sheets. The results showed that primary sludge could be incorporated 

in fiber-cement sheets in low contents, without damaging the final product characteristics 

[United Nations Economic and Social Council, 2001]. 

 Fiber-cement is usually used as a building material in covering roofs, although it 

can be used for other constructive purposes. Its composition incorporates up to 2.6% of 

cellulose fibers coming from kraft softwood pulp (virgin long fibers pulp - VLFP) in order 

to make advantageous use of its fiber content. These fibers are longer and coarser than 

most fibers and have been found to provide many benefits in fiber-cement applications due 

to their high modulus and high fiber strength [Morton et al., 2006].  

 The focus of this work is to evaluate the use of primary sludge from kraft hardwood 

pulping process in fiber-cement sheets production at an industrial scale. At this level, there 

is a need to control parameters such as the sludge incorporation level and its quality as a 

raw material, the water quality in the process and the final product characteristics. 

3.2  Experimental 

 Virgin long fiber pulp (VLFP) represents 2.6% of total fiber-cement composition in 

proportion of dry raw materials. Conventionally the used fiber in fiber-cement process 

production is from softwood. In this experimental work, these softwood long fibers were 

replaced by hardwood fibers from primary sludge generated in pulp and paper mill effluent 

treatment at a fixed replacement level of 25%.

3.2.1 Materials 

Standard Materials 

 The fiber-cement sheet samples were prepared with standard fiber-cement raw 

materials: Portland cement (to provide strength): Commercial available ASTM Type I - 

42.5R, PVA–fiber (the long term durability PVA fibers is used as reinforcement in cement-

base (Akers et al., 1989), and other commercial characteristics, such as, high modulus 

polyvinyl alcohol, elongation (~6.5%); Amorphous-silica: Dry silica fume (Elken 

Microsilica Grade 940), with high SiO2 content (&gt;90%), low moisture (&lt;1,0%), loss on 

ignition less than 3,0%, particle retention at 45 micron sieve below 1,5%, Bulk density 

(undensified: 200-350 kg/m3); Virgin long fiber pulp: kraft pulp softwood fibers, bleached, 

moisture (? 10%), Ash content (&amp;lt;1,0%);  Additives: (i) Flocculant (Magnafloc 1011): 

White granular powder, solid grade polymer, particle size (98% &amp;lt;1400 µm), Bulk density 

(~0,65g/cm3); (ii) Antifoam (STRUKTOL J650): Polyalcohol based on polyoxyethylene-

polyoxypropylene blockcopolymers.  

Primary sludge  

 The primary sludge is generated in the clarification of process water by kidney 

treatments, e.g. dissolved air flotation [Monte et al., 2009]. The sludge consists of 

hardwood fibers (~70%, where a small content of this total may be associated with 

insoluble lignin) and fillers (~5% of sand and 25% of precipitated calcium carbonate 

(PCC)). The PCC content in the sludge is generated in the integrated kraft pulp and paper 

process by the chemical reaction CaO+CO2?CaCO3, being limited by the calcium content 

measured as 10.37% (Table 3. 1) and its atomic mass (40 g/mol). The primary sludge 

specific characterization is presented on Table 3. 1. Figure 3.1. shows fiber nature of this 

sludge and part of the inorganic content material present in them. 

3.2.2 Methods 

 In order to replace VLFP with primary sludge in fiber-cement production at an 

industrial scale, the following aspects were verified:

? Process and environmental control: characterization tests in process water  (suspended 

solids and dissolved salts, chlorides, sulphates, COD and metals)  and cellulose VLFP

? Final product: chemical and mechanical characterization tests in final product 

(according to Standard procedure); and

 The fiber-cement production process (Figure 3.3) begins with VLFP disintegration 

and a beating process.  The beating process can be defined as a mechanical treatment of 

pulp carried out in the presence of water and, in this case, by passing the pulp fibers 

suspension through a disk refiner consisting of a rotating bladed element that moves in 

conjunction with a stationary bladed element. The term “beating” is usually applied to the 

batch treatment of pulp suspensions [Coutts, 2005].  

 
Figure 3. 2. Primary sludge ready to be processed and to be incorporated to the disintegrator in big bags. 

 Coutts and Kightly (1984) state that refining plays an important role in producing 

surface area for fiber-to-fiber or fiber-to-matrix (in case of composites) bonding and, more 

important, can assist in controlling the drainage rates of processing liquids during the 

fabrication of products. Refining affects the hydraulic properties of the fiber effectively 

reducing its average diameter. This process also promotes an internal fibrillation or 

delamination on fibers, external fibrillation of its surface and fines formation.  

In the pulp beating, the VLFP and sludge were mixed with water. The 

disintegration process lasts around 30 minutes. In this point a suspension sample is 

collected to measure the Shopper Riegler degree (ºSR). If an acceptable ºSR value 

(between 55 and 70 ºSR) is obtained, the suspension is sent to the pulper. Meanwhile, the 

silica was already mixed with water before processing. The pulp is mixed with cement, 

amorphous-silica and PVA in the mixer. The final suspension is carried to the fiber-cement 

sheet forming machine which includes a felt belt and four vats that filter the fiber-cement 

sheets water excess. The fiber-cement sheets are taken to the drying oven at 85ºC to 

remove the moisture.  

 The global fiber-cement sheets production involves the following steps:

 25% of the virgin long fibers pulp (VLFP) used in fiber-cement production were 

substituted by primary sludge in the industrial test. The fiber-cement sheets are produced in 

batches. Each production batch involves, in this particular factory, a consumption of 195kg 

of virgin long fibers cellulose pulp. Hence, each batch received 48,75kg (dry base) of 

primary sludge and 146,25kg of virgin long fibers pulp during industrial test days. Twelve 

fiber-cement series with primary sludge were produced in two days. The samples with 

sludge incorporation were collected for tests in this period and the reference samples were 

collected a week before, on normal production days. The cellulose sludge chemical 

parameters were previously determined (Table 3.3) and involved moisture, pH, organic

Water samples from the process were also collected before and during the industrial test. 

The samples named as CW represent the “Control Water” and the PSW samples represent 

the “Primary Sludge Water”. The measured water parameters were total suspended solids, 

dissolved salts, chlorides, sulphates and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) and metals 

content. The water samples collection places in the process are also presented on Figure 3. 

3. The parameters measurement and methods are presented on Table 3.2. 

Table 3. 2. Samples control, parameters and respective Standard. 

 

 During the fiber-cement production process, the pulp and the sludge were beat and 

the Shopper Riegler (ºSR) parameter was measured. This parameter allows evaluating the 

pulp beating degree. This method is designed to provide a measure of the rate at which a 

dilute suspension of pulp may be dewatered. The determination of the drainability of a pulp 

suspension in water is described in terms of a Shopper Riegler (ºSR) number. The 

drainability is related to the surface conditions and swelling of the fibers, and constitutes a 

useful index of the amount of mechanical treatment to which the pulp has been subjected 

[Morton et al., 2006]. In this fiber-cement production study case, the acceptable results are 

obtained within the range of 55 to 70 ºSR, following the standard proceedings. The highest 

this value less drainable is the fibers cake. 

 The industrial test took 12 hours in constant production. In the first 6 hours of 

manufacturing, 1500 sheets were produced with primary sludge and 15 of them were 

randomly chosen as samples during the test time and submitted to quality control 

parameters checking. In the last 6 hours, 1500 standard sheets (without sludge) were 

produced and 15 standard fiber-cement sheets were selected for tests with the same

3.3  Results and discussion 

3.3.1 Process and environmental control 

 In terms of chemical characteristics, the primary sludge does not present 

undesirable agents for fiber-cement production. It consists primarily of fibers, fines and 

inorganic material in mills that employ fillers in their products [Monte et al., 2009]. 

 Figure 3.5 presents the fibers microscopic aspect. It is possible to verify the 

difference between the Eucalyptus and Pinus fibers thickness, around 10 to 20 µ m and 40 

to 60 µm, respectively. Eucalyptus globulus fiber achieves ~1 mm as maximum length. 

The Pinus fibers are longer than Eucalyptus globulus fiber. This characteristic could 

condition the sludge incorporation content and final product characteristics. 

 The Schopper-Riegler and refinement time results are presented on Figure 3.6 and 

Figure 3.7, respectively. It was possible to decrease the refinement time in the process with 

the primary sludge incorporation. The Eucalyptus fibers achieve the same ºSR degree using 

lower energy time comparing to Pinus fibers. Lower refinement time represents low energy

water. Total suspended solids in PSW are only slightly higher than the control value 

sample (Table 3.4). 

 
Figure 3. 6. Schopper-Riegler and refinement time results (S- with sludge; N- No sludge). 

 The VLFP represents 2.6% of dry material in fiber-cement production. 25% of this 

amount was substituted by primary sludge. Knowing that 40% of primary sludge 

composition is composed by inorganic material, the sludge suspended solids contribution 

in fiber-cement production is estimated in 26 kg per ton of dried fiber-cement produced. 

This maximum solids content increasing might be retained on fiber-cement sheets or 

drained to the process water together conventional solids. The increasing of sulphates and 

chlorides present in sludge composition parameters didn’t have significant alterations in 

terms of process. 

3.3.2 Final product control 

In terms of moisture content, every value for sheets produced with primary sludge 

achieved the specification limits. Fiber-cement sheets produced with primary sludge tend 

to present higher wet density values than the standard sheets. This happens because of 

shorter fibers presence in their composition. These fibers could more easily retain water 

and solids between the sheet mesh spaces (Table 3.5). Primary sludge includes in its 

composition almost 40% of inorganic solids, namely, sand. These inorganic charges 

increase the fiber-cement sheet density in wet and dry state.

 The bending moment values of quality product control are between 55 and 71 

Nm/m and load at rupture minimum acceptable value is 4655 N. According to the obtained 

results every fiber-cement sheet produced with primary sludge incorporation presented 

acceptable values for both parameters on the final product quality control (limits presented 

in Table 3.5).

distinguish Eucalyptus from Pinus fibers by SEM in the fiber-cement matrix. To get 

additional information regarding the fibrous aspect of these materials, surface samples of 

the produced fiber-cement, with and without sludge, were scratched, prepared and 

observed by SEM (scanning electron microscope analysis).

3.3.3 Evaluation of solution sustainability 

 In 2008, the average fiber-cement production in this case-study factory was 

estimated at 20000 ton/year, consuming around 600 ton/year of VLFP. The costs 

associated to this cellulose-based product amount were estimated in 350000 €/year (VLFP 

= 585 €/ton). By adopting this recycling solution, this fiber-cement company saves around 

87500 €/year on costs related to the virgin long fibers pulp purchase. The impact of the 

partial substitution of virgin pulp by primary sludge in the matrix of fiber-cement 

production was estimated based on the pulp costs, sludge transportation and energy costs 

related to refinement process. Table 3.6 presents the values used in this assessment and the 

estimated results. At the same time, this application allows to put in practice a sustainable 

waste valorisation solution, avoiding disposal of 500 ton/year (150 ton/year in dry base) to 

waste landfill, with an estimated cost around 11200 €/year (based on a landfill cost of 

22.40 €/ton). The costs for the paper and pulp mill, related to this particular waste disposal, 

must be replaced by waste transport to the fiber-cement factory, which were estimated at 



Chapter 3 

 

 

57 
 

11200 €/year. This value was calculated using a base price of 0.08 €/ton/km for waste 

transportation and admitting a total distance of 280 km in a two way travel between the 

particular factories involved in this case study.  

This waste valorisation represents an environmental solution avoiding the waste 

landfill. Even if the transportation costs were supported by the fiber-cement factory this 

waste valorisation would present an economic benefit solution. 

Table 3. 6. Primary sludge valorisation in fiber-cement (Costs/benefits analysis). 

   

3.4  Conclusions 

 It was possible to verify the incorporation of cellulose sludge in this construction 

material, without affecting its general product characteristics or its processing. 

Replacing 25% of the long cellulose fiber traditionally used by primary sludge from 

effluent treatment allowed the production of fiber-cement sheets, with properties within the 

recommended specifications for the final product.  

 The obtained values in water control does not indicate significant alterations 

comparing them in terms of COD, chlorides, sulphates, dissolved salts and metals during 

the test period. 

 The 40% of inorganic charges present in primary cellulose sludge promotes an 

increase on the fiber-cement sheets wet density but, the results are within the acceptable 

limit value. The bending moment and load at rupture for sheets with primary sludge were 

also acceptable according to the final product quality control.  

 In summary, the substitution of conventional cellulose fiber for primary sludge 

from pulp and paper is a sustainable recycling and valorisation solution without significant

Furthermore, this waste valorisation not only presents an economic benefit around 87500

and pulp company. If the transportation cost is supported by the fiber-cement company 

then its saving with this recycling solution will be around 76.300 €/year.

Abstract 

Nowadays, the increasing amount of wastes is a concerning reality and the environmental 

aspects has become a major priority. Following this worry, the purpose of this 

experimental study was to investigate the possibility of using pulp and paper inorganic 

wastes, named dregs and grits, in bituminous mixtures as aggregate replacement to reduce 

environmental effects of these wastes disposal. First, the wastes were chemically and 

physically characterized and also tested primarily taking into account the requirements for 

aggregates in bituminous mixtures. Then, formulations were prepared replacing aggregates 

with wastes in different amounts. The mechanical properties of these mixtures containing 

wastes were compared with reference samples based on standard methods. According to 

the results it was possible to verify that grits had a good performance and it might be 

directly tested industrially as an aggregate in road construction.  On the other hand, dregs 

need to be treated before incorporation to guarantee stable mixes in terms of water 

sensitivity.

4.1  Introduction 

 The re-use of wastes is important from different points of view: It helps to save and 

sustain the natural resources which are not replenished; it decreases the pollution of the 

environment and it also helps to save and recycle energy in production process [Hassani et 

al., 2005; Rocha, 2003]. The productive use of wastes material represents a way of solving 

some problems of solid waste management [Davis and Cornwell, 1998]. Moreover, 

suitable landfill sites are becoming more difficult to find as urban areas expand [Ngoc &amp;amp; 

Schnitzer, 2009]. 

 Wastes and industrial by-products could be valuable materials as alternative 

resources for building and construction and other applications [D. van Beers et al., 2009]. 

The European Directive Nº 2006/12/CE leads to several legal dispositions for the 

management of wastes in which environmental objectives are set, namely, the need of 

restricting and in a short time the volume of wastes deposit in landfill. 

 Several studies were published on the use of waste material in pavements. These 

include the use of fly ash [Jackson et al., 2009], waste pumice [Saltan, 2008], glass, steel 

slag, tires and plastics [Huang et al., 2007], marble quarry waste [Akbulut &amp;amp; Gürer, 2007], 

cement and mortars [Coutinho &amp;amp; Garcia, 2008], polypropylene fibers [Serkan, 2008]. 

Following this perspective, this research describes a study developed with wastes from 

pulp and paper industry in asphalt pavements application.  

 The pulp and paper industry generates large volume of wastes which is technology-

dependent but the estimate is around 100 tons of waste for 550 tons of pulp production 

[Celpa, 2008]. In terms of Europe, eleven million tonnes of waste are produced yearly by 

this sector [Monte et al, 2009]. It generates, in all stages of its production process, solid 

wastes with different composition and moisture content [Modolo et al., 2008]. 

 The produced wastes are of organic and inorganic origin, some of them with reuse 

potential. Two of these wastes, named as dregs and grits, are still sent for landfill disposal. 

Dregs are essentially sodium and calcium carbonates (Na2CO3 and CaCO3), sodium 

sulphide (Na2S) and a small organic fraction that was not totally burned in the recuperation 

biomass boiler. Different salts are present in their composition coming from the pulp and 

paper mill process. They result from the smelt dissolution with the white liquor. Smelt is a 

flux material that is drained from the burning process in the recuperation boiler. This waste

(dregs) is generated by the separation of CaCO3 and CaO in the green liquor clarifier. Grits 

are formed basically by CaCO3 and CaO which did not react in the slaker. Slaker is the 

place where the reaction between Na2CO3 (present in green liquor) plus CaO (lime coming 

from lime oven) and H2O occurs, giving NaOH plus CaCO3, which constitutes the lime 

sludge that will be filtered and re-sent to lime oven for calcination. 

 The purpose of this experimental study was to investigate the possibility of using 

these pulp and paper wastes in asphalt concrete mixes as aggregate replacement in road 

regularization layers, through mix designs and specific characterization tests, contributing 

to reduce environmental effects of wastes disposal. 

4.2  Experimental 

 The two bituminous pavement top layers involve aggregates and bitumen (Figure 

4.1). The experimental tests were done with mixes specimens developed according to 

Dense Bituminous Layer specifications [Portuguese Road Authority – EP, 2008]. This 

layer was chosen because it excludes external environmental agents’ access and it has 

flexible specific conditions for specific aggregates.  

 
Figure 4. 1. Flexible pavement example. 

 Hence, the wastes were first chemically and physically characterized and also tested 

as specific aggregates for bituminous mixes. 

 In all the work stages, Marshall specimens were prepared in laboratory scale 

according to EN 12697.  This method is applied to every dense bituminous layer types with 

maximum nominal aggregates dimension equal or lower than 25mm. The procedure 

implies that aggregates and bitumen are heated at temperatures around 160ºC. The 

specimens were compacted using a Marshall automatic hammer, with 75 compaction blows 

on each side. The specimens were compacted and kept at room temperature (20ºC) for a

week. The specimens’ bulk specific and apparent gravity were measured. The mineral 

aggregate voids (VMA) and air voids were determined. The specimens were kept in warm 

water (60ºC) for 20 minutes before submitting to Marshall Stability test (maximum weight 

which promotes the specimens fracture) and the Marshall flow test (maximum deformation 

in which the specimen rupture occurs). Marshall stability and flow tests were used to verify 

the pavements wastes potential applicability.  

 The standards used to obtain Marshall Test results for this study were: 

(a) EN 12697-30: 2000. Bituminous mixes (BM) - Test methods for hot mix asphalt - 

Specimen preparation, impact compactor: Mixes preparation; 

(b) EN 12 697-10: 2002. BM -  Test methods for hot mix asphalt – Compatibility;

characteristics of bituminous specimens; 

(e) EN 12697-12: 2003. BM - Determination of the water sensitivity of bituminous 

specimens (“Conserved Strength”). 

 Based on Marshall mix design results, the optimum binder content (OBC) for mixes 

was determinated. The OBC results were used to prepare the final mixes for the 

“Conserved Strength”. The specimens’ results were controlled and compared to the 

Portuguese code for dense bituminous mix asphalt values for typical heavy traffic type 

values. They are presented in Table 4.5. The final “Conserved Strength” results were 

considered to examine the positive effects of wastes in the mixes. 

4.2.1 Materials 

 Wastes: Grits (G), Conventional Dregs (DC) and Dregs without lime sludge (DWLS) 

were collected in a pulp and paper mill. The DWLS was taken from a filter press, which allows 

having dregs without lime precoat that provided a more homogeneous waste. The DC was 

taken from the vacuum rotary drum, which receives lime precoat during the waste filtration 

process. These wastes aspect is shown in Figure 4.2. The wastes were dried at 105ºC and 

automatically and manually ground for the characterization tests and mix design phase. The 

characteristics of the wastes used in this study are summarized in Table 4.1.

 The work was divided in three phases. The formulations samples identification is 

shown in Table 4.4. In all phases the Marshall Test specimens were tested according to EN 

12697.  

Phase I (Wastes and conventional aggregates characterization and preliminary 

mixes characterization):  

 In this phase, the wastes were submitted to a specific characterization (Chemical 

and Physical) to identify and quantify possible undesirable compounds as sodium, heavy 

metals. To evaluate the fines content, specific characterization tests for wastes in 

pavements sector were included. These results lead to a preliminary study with the

aggregates replacing in bituminous mixes. Preliminary experiments on Marshall specimens 

established the mixture proportions used in phase I. In this experiment, 20 specimens were 

produced (four for each formulation) and the bitumen content was determined to be 5.4% 

(5.4% by weight of bituminous mix). In this phase, the bituminous mixes with 0%, 5% and 

10% of wastes content were investigated. 

Table 4. 4. Work phases distribution and Mixes identification. 

 

Phase II (Mixes design (OBC) and mixes water sensitivity): 

 After the preliminary study validation in phase I, the dregs content was varied as 1, 

2, 3, 4 % and the grits content varied as 5 and 10%. The bitumen content was varied as 4.5, 

5.0, 5.5 and 6.0% (% by weight of bituminous mix) in the formulations. The test results 

provide indication on the stability, flow, air voids content, voids in mineral aggregate 

(VMA) and voids filled with bitumen. These values are essential for the mixes’ behaviour 

understanding. The optimum bitumen content (OBC) was determined according to the 

Marshall stability, voids content of compacted specimens, specific gravity and flow for 

each formulation. Using the OBC, more 42 specimens with the appropriated OBC were 

made and the “Conserved strength” was evaluated. Six specimens for each formulation 

were prepared. They were separated in 2 sets of three specimens. One set was packed in 

water at 40ºC and the other group in a controlled room at 20ºC during 72 hours. After this, 

Marshall stability and flow were checked.

 In this phase, mixes with washed wastes were tested in order to try to reduce or 

eliminate water sensitive detected in phase II. The washing process involved the following 

procedure: The wastes samples were weight (approximately 1200g) and dried (105ºC). 

Then the waste was set into 3 litres of heated distilled-water (around 70ºC) and stirred 

during 10 minutes to guarantee the complete agglomerates dissolution. The water was 

heated to simulate the original dregs generation process. The solution was filtered after 10 

min. The conductivity and soluble salts content in the filtrate were analysed to control the 

washing efficiency (250 ml for each sample). The process was repeated in every sample 

until it presents low constant values. In the solid waste sample, methylene-blue (MB) test 

was used before and after washing, in order to check the waste washing efficiency. MB is a 

basic colorant, represented by the formula C16H18N3ClS.2H2 and constituted by lamellate 

molecules with unit effective area of 107 Å [Gomes, 1986]. There is a relationship between 

the MB parameter and CEC (cation exchange capacity) and these values permit to evaluate 

the material and indicate if it has a plastic behaviour [Gomes, 1986]. 

4.3  Results and Discussion 

4.3.1 Phase I 

General characterization 

 DC and DWLS present high moisture content (~50%) which represents energy 

costs if the material needs drying. The sodium content for DC (6.1%) and DWLS (15.4%) 

is considered high because this element is soluble in water which might be a problem for 

the final material application. Grits is practically constituted by calcium carbonate 

[(38%Ca/40gCa)*100gCaCO3) = 95%], which is interesting for building materials 

application since calcium carbonate is used as raw materials in many of them. 

 The Volatile Total Solids at 525ºC content in G and DC wastes is acceptable in 

bituminous aggregate criteria. For pavements application, DWLS formulations must be 

carefully designed to try not to exceed the acceptable limits for organic inert contents 

(&lt;1%).  

 The potentially toxic metals wastes obtained results are under the permitted limits 

by Environmental Legislation. They are classified as inert-wastes according to DL 

152/2002.  



 
Chapter 4 

68 
 

Soluble salts are not convenient for bituminous aggregates. The chlorides content might 

represent a problem for DC and DWLS. The soluble salts make the mixes “Conserved 

strength” values to decrease. Gradation results are presented in Table 4.3 and Figure 4.3. 

Grits (G) present similar grain size distribution compared to crushed stone usually used on 

bituminous mixes as fine aggregate. The DC curve presents the finest composition, 

compared to the other wastes.  DC presents lime sludge (where 97% of lime particles size 

is below 75 µ m) in its composition and it represents around 40% of this waste (40% value 

reflects the way how the vacuum rotary drum is operated). Lime sludge presents fine 

particle size and it may influence DC grain size results.  

 
Figure 4. 3. Fine wastes particle size distribution (&lt;0.063mm - SediGraph Method). 

 Grits (G) sand equivalent value is similar to crushed stone for bituminous mixture. 

This is not observed for Dregs (DC and DWLS) because of their high content in fine 

material. DC and DWLS based samples results presented some plasticity behaviour (Table 

4.1). The plasticity behaviour might cause higher bitumen absorption and consequently 

might turn the mixes susceptible to volumetric changes. This test showed that Grits is non-

plastic. Aggregates for bituminous applications must present Methylene-Blue (MB) value 

below 0.8% [Picado Santos, 2002]. MB test results for grits (G) were acceptable (Table 

4.1). DC presented 0.19% and DWLS presented 2.14%. This higher value for DWLS is 

associated to the lime sludge absence that has a high cation exchange (CEC). The

characterization results made possible to evaluate the wastes incorporation content and 

some mixes behaviour. 

Mix design (Preliminary study) 

 Table 4.5. shows the preliminary study results. Grits mixes (5 and 10% of 

incorporation) achieved the established values for all parameters. Besides, the stability 

result for MB10%G is even better than the control mix. Marshall Stability was achieved for 

all mixes according to established values.

Mixes with dregs (MB10%DC) presented a not acceptable value in terms of voids 

(6.9%). When this parameter is higher than the specific value the mixes loose durability, 

workability and fragile (they have lower deformation strength). High dregs content 

promote more bitumen absorption, which increases bituminous mixes costs. This fact 

limited the dregs content in the next development phase. Figure 4.4 presents the mixes 

microstructure photos. It is clearly visible on Figure 4.4“c” that the dregs mix is dried and 

opaque compared to the other ones.

Figure 4.7 presents the aggregates mix gradation. The values are included in the 

limits for this type of mixes. Marshall Mix design results are presented from Figure 4.8 

(control specimen) to Figure 4.14 (MBG10%). MBDC4% (Figure 4.12) presented a high-

maximum value (24.3 kN) for this parameter. The flow value indicates the flexibility and 

plasticity properties of the asphalt concretes under traffic load. All mixes indicated a 

consistent relationship between the flow and bitumen content. As much the binder content 

is increased the flow also increases. The highest and the lowest flow value registered were 

for MBDC1% (5.84mm) and MBDC3% (2.91mm), respectively. Mixes should present 

flow values up to 4 mm, which is the highest allowed value indicated. When 6% of 

bitumen was used, only MB5%G mix presented a lower value for this parameter. The bulk 

specific gravity is uniform and acceptable for all mixes. MBDC4% presented the lower 

value compared to the other mixes including the control reference one.

The voids content for the mixes prepared with 5.5 and 6.0% of bitumen, except 

MBDC3% (Figure 4.11) and MBDC4% (Figure 4.13), presented values below the allowed 

minimum limit (3%). This low value has a direct influence in the mixes apparent gravity 

and bitumen saturation. The mixes become more susceptible to permanent deformation. 

These parameters are associated to the compaction mix level and permit to improve the 

pavement general performance. MBDC4% presented the highest VMA value (16.8%). This 

result might be associated with the dregs’ content and the filler absence. All mixes 

presented VMA values between 14.8 to 16.8%.

Table 4. 7. “Conserved Strength” mixes results (phase II). 

 

 Grits (MBG5% and MBG10%) and control mixes (MBBr) presented lower voids 

content than mixes with Dregs (MBDC1, 2, 3, 4%). This is because the mixes filler content 

is between 2 and 3% as in the control sample (3% of filler). When filler is completely 

substituted by dregs, it makes the mix more porous and less workable. Void filled with 

asphalt (bitumen) results suggest that dregs absorb more bitumen than the other mixes. The 

optimum binder content (OBC) was determined by Marshall mixes design results. This 

value was used to achieve the mixes “conserved strength” in Table 4.6. Mixes MBBr, 

MBDC1%, MBG5% and MBG10% presented a good behaviour. 75% of conserved 

strength was achieved for them. MBDC2%, MBDC3% and MBDC4% presented water 

sensitivity. This behaviour was already expected because Dregs present soluble salts in 

their composition. 

 MDC1% and MDC4% voids content results are below the permitted value (3-6%). 

MBDC4% specimen dissolved in water, which made impossible to perform the test. 

Regarding the “conserved strength” behaviour of Grits-containing mixes, their 

performance is acceptable compared to the control mix. Incorporation of 5% Grits gave 

slightly worse result than the mix with 10% of Grits, probably related with the particle size 

distribution in the mixture and higher voids content in the 5% Grits mix. This phase II 

results demonstrated a bad performance for dregs mixes. In a tentative to obtain acceptable

values for dregs formulations for this application, it was decided to treat the wastes to 

eliminate the soluble salts. On the next phase, dregs without lime sludge (DWLS) were 

used in the mixes to evaluate the effect of removing this fine material usually associated to 

Dregs generation in the process. This waste will replace the conventional dregs technology 

in some pulp and paper mills in the future.

4.3.3 Phase III 

 Washing process 

 The Dregs washing process caused physical and chemical positive alterations on 

the wastes, making them more workable. This process demonstrated that is possible to 

obtain a better material after a simple treatment. The monitored parameters results during 

DC and DWLS washing can be seen in Figure 4.5. The measured parameters become lower 

and almost constant with the washing process for both wastes. The soluble salts decreasing 

content is an important factor for the possibility of re-using these materials in pavement 

sector. This kind of salts represents a problem in terms of “conserved strength” properties 

affecting the final product.  

 In terms of gradation, the final material presented fewer particles between 2 to 

0.425mm sieves compared to the wastes gradation before washing. These particles were 

disaggregated and dissolved in smaller particles with dimensions between 0.18 and 0.075 

mm (Table 4.7). Now, washed DC and washed DWLS gradation is “similar” to hydraulic 

lime (compare the results checking Table 4.2. 

 The MB parameter was also checked on the wastes. The washing results for MB 

parameter for DC and DWLS decreased the MB values considerably. The results are 

shown in Figure 4.6. The plasticity index after washing wasn’t checked but it would be 

interesting if it is lower.  

To achieve the “conserved strength” value for dregs mixes, DC and DWLS were 

washed and tested in two incorporation contents (2 and 4%), using the same OBC found 

for these formulations in phase II. Good results were obtained for all parameters in every 

mixes (Table 4.8). MBCD4% presented a very good performance (97%) compared to the 

control mix, MBBr (90.7%), even with voids content lower than the allowed value. This 

problem might be easily solved by a particle size adjustment of the aggregate. The problem 

with water sensitivity was solved with the washing procedure.

4.4 Conclusions 

 In this work, the properties of pulp and paper mill wastes were compared with 

conventional aggregates used in asphalt pavements, in order to value them as raw materials 

for this application. Hence, standard aggregates and pavements tests were carried out and 

the main conclusions were: 

1. According to the results, it was possible to verify that grits could be directly tested 

as an aggregate for this pavements construction sector. Indeed, Grits mixes are 

acceptable and ready to be tested in industrial scale. This waste is compatible with 

crushed stone already used as aggregate for road pavements.  

2. Dregs presented soluble salts that didn’t allow direct applications as-received from 

the production process. After washing process, Dregs mixes had compatible values 

compared to the reference mixes. They achieved Marshall Stability and flow values 

as expected. 

3. Washing process efficiency was demonstrated based in the results of conductivity, 

soluble salts and methylene blue tests. These removed salts can be returned to the 

pulp and paper mill representing, for this industry, also a valuable economic and

recycling aspect resulting from this work. In terms of gradation, DC and DWLS 

had a significant reduction in particle size after washing, becoming finer. This fact 

made them more compatible with the conventional “fillers” used in pavement 

sector. 

4. In terms of waste management, it is possible to conclude that these wastes, 

generated in huge amounts during pulp paper production, can easily be drained by 

this large tonnage activity (pavement construction sector), avoiding their landfill 

and contributing at the same time for natural resources preservation.  

 Pulp and paper mill permits to adapt a waste treatment stage quite easily. It even 

promotes wastes’ salts recovering to the pulp process. The water used in the treatment 

can also be re-processed into the mill and recovered. The costs relative to the wastes 

landfill are superior to the implementing solution, economically and environmentally. 

Furthermore, this treatment allows having wastes ready to be used in pavements 

application.

Abstract 

This study reports the use of lime mud (LM) in cement-based-mortars. Lime mud is a 

waste generated in the production of cellulose by the kraft mill process. It is mainly 

composed of CaCO3, a small amount of magnesium carbonate and other trace minerals. 

Mortars were prepared by adding different amounts of LM (10, 20 and 30% by weight of 

cement) in dry weight. The mortar compositions were evaluated through rheology and flow 

table measurements, assuring that all the samples exhibited adequate conditions for testing 

in both equipments. The hardened state properties were also evaluated through mechanical 

strengths at 7, 28 and 90 days of curing. Following a waste management solution 

perspective, this work intend to provide a general evaluation of LM application in cement 

based mortars, looking at both fresh and hardened properties in order to guarantee that the 

final application requirements are not hindered.

5.1  Introduction 

The negative influence of wastes on the construction materials properties require further 

research in order to optimize the characteristics of them. In recent years, the environmental 

damage and the wastes generated from industrial activity, increased significantly 

worldwide and one of the most common solid waste disposal means is in controlled 

landfills. Thus, the raw natural materials have become scarce and the adverse impacts on 

the environment are visible [Binici et al., 2008; UMTC, 1995; OECD, 1997]. Best 

available techniques for reducing waste is to minimize the generation of solid waste and/or 

use these by products as alternative raw-materials, wherever practicable. Pulp and papers 

mills generates thousands tons of solid waste (organic and inorganic) every year that go for 

landfill disposal (mainly inorganic types). The amount and the composition of these wastes 

depend necessarily on the process techniques applied and the raw materials used to obtain 

the pulp and/or the paper quality desired. In general, the solid waste composition from pulp 

and paper mills is known and constant, as a result of the current, highly controlled 

production process which permits the use and valorisation of the wastes in safe and 

environmental way [Monte et al., 2009]. Some applications of theses wastes have been 

frequently researched including aggregates for bituminous mixtures [Modolo et al., 2010], 

cement [Ahmadi and Al-Khaja, 2001; Coutinho and Garcia, 2008], brick [Cernec et al., 

2005] and fiber-cement [Modolo et al., 2011]. From pulp mills, inorganic sludges are 

separated from the chemical recovery cycle and normally landfilled after dewatering. Lime 

mud is an industrial pulp and paper kraft mill solid waste of the chemical recovery unit 

[Figure 5.1]. It has the code 03 03 09 in the European List of wastes (2004). It is mainly 

composed by calcium carbonate, small amount of magnesium carbonate and other trace 

minerals [Gaskin, 2004; Li et al., 2012]. Normally, the major part of this sludge is used as 

raw-material in the limestone make up process. Although this waste is partially used as 

raw-material in the own pulp and paper process, in this specific case, due to limitations of 

the lime kiln, the limestone make-up does not drain all lime mud generated by the 

production process. Then, the lime mud surplus has been landfilled (approximately 500 

tons/month in wet base). Essentially, the production of industrial pre-mixed mortars 

exceeds several million tons each year, consuming a huge amount of natural but pre-treated 

raw materials (e.g. siliceous sand) as aggregate as well as cement. This activity could be

looked as a target for the use of lime mud, as currently happens with the ashes generated 

from the coal and biomass combustion in concrete [Ampadu  et al., 2002; Cordeiro et al., 

2008]. Several studies related with the use of wastes as filler, aggregates or cement 

replacement material in mortars or concrete have been researched. Some of them indicate 

that may be the wastes could be classified as a pozzolanic material (i.e. cane bagasse ash), 

but some points that their activity depends significantly on its particle size and fineness 

[Cordeiro et al., 2008; Rajamma et al., 2009; Taylor and Tait, 1999; Modolo et al., 2013; 

Pérez-Carrión et al., 2014; Argiz et al., 2013]. Specifically, some uses for lime mud, such 

as in bricks, cement and pavements could be good alternatives to drain huge amounts of 

this solid waste. Ero?lu (2006) tested lime mud also as soil stabilization of forest roads. 

The results obtained showed that roads deformation could be stabilized and maintained by 

using lime mud. In another work, lime mud was tested as additive in composite cement and 

the results confirmed it as a potential waste for this application [Ero?lu et al., 2007]. The 

use of limestone fillers in concrete and mortars has becoming more and more common in 

recent years, pushed by economic and ecological drivers. Even the cement production is 

now dominated by type II formulations, where the clinker is partially replaced by limestone 

fillers (up to 35 wt.%). In most cases limestone fillers simply acts as a component in the 

cement/mortar [Vuk et al., 2001; Benachour et al., 2008; Felekoglu, 2007]. However, 

European Standards relating to aggregates for mortars (EN 13139: 2003) allows up to 22% 

in mass as an aggregate component.  

Following the waste management perspective of finding an efficient alternative of lime 

mud valorisation, this work intend to show, through bench scale developed work, a 

solution for this waste incorporation in cement-based materials providing not only a 

general approach of lime mud characteristics, but also present results about the final 

product properties (mortars) in the fresh and hardened state.

5.2 Experimental procedure 

Lime mud (LM) sample was used as collected, from a rotary filter chamber located 

in a pulp paper plant in Aveiro, Portugal. Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) type II -32.5 N, 

produced with 65-79% of clinker, 21-35% of lime and 0-5% other components including 

calcium sulphate as setting regulator, was used in the present study to prepare pastes and 

mortars. OPC has an average particle size of 14 µ m.  

Avoiding energy costs in the future; the lime mud was tested without dewatering. The 

moisture content (34%) was kept as collected and used in the mortars production. The 

water final ratio was calculated adding up the waste water content plus additional fresh

water. Siliceous sand was sieved through a 1.18 mm before use in the mixture as aggregate. 

Its average size is 0.830 mm. The particle size distribution of LM was performed using a 

Coulter LS particle size analyzer (LS230FM). The real density of LM particles was 

determined with picnometer method (ISO/TS 17892-3/2004). The specific surface area was 

measured by nitrogen adsorption method according to Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET). 

Thermal gravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TG/DTA) of the LM were 

performed up to 1000ºC with a heating rate of 10 ºC/min, in a simultaneous TG/DTA (STA 

409 EP). The chemical composition of the LM and CEM II 32.5N were evaluated using X-

ray fluorescence spectroscopy using a Panalytical Axios spectrometer. The microstructure 

of the LM was studied using a scanning electron microscope (SEM - Hitachi SU-70). The 

chloride content was determined in the solid waste (LM) and in the mortars by the 

Argentometric method (CHLORIDE, 4500-Cl-; Standard Methods Committee, 1997). The 

sulfate content was determined in LM by Gravimetric method (SULFATE, 4500-SO4
-2; 

ignition of residue, Standard Methods Committee, 1997). Cement pastes (w/b = 50 wt.%.) 

and cement mortars (water/binder ~ 62 wt.%.) were prepared using different amounts of 

LM (10, 20 and 30% by weight of cement) in dry weight. The amount of water used in the 

mixtures was defined regarding the dosage of LM, in order to obtain an adequate 

workability condition to test in the rheometer and flow table. The workability of mortars 

was determined through rheology and flow table measurements, assuring that all samples 

exhibited an adequate condition in both equipments. In this way, it was possible to obtain a 

more complete characterization in the fresh state. The complete cement-mortars 

formulations are shown in Table 5.1.  

The procedures used to prepare the formulations included: (i) placing lime mud into 

the water; (ii) mixing for 1 min at a low rotation speed of 60 rpm; (iii) stopping for 1 min; 

(iv) mixing again for 1 min at a higher rotation speed (120 rpm). A rheometer (Viskomat 

PC model, Schleibinger) was used to measure the rheological behaviour of fresh mortars, 

using a maximum speed rotation (100 rpm) and 60 min of total test time. The rheological 

parameters (yield stress and plastic viscosity), was defined by using the Bingham model 

[Paiva et al., 2009; Ferraris et al., 2000; Banfil, 2003; Senff et al., 2012]. The workability 

of mortars was also measured through the spread diameter on flow table, according to EN 

1015-3:1999. The setting time of samples was determined by the Vicat needle penetration 

method following EN 196-3:2005, while the kinetic of hydration was determinate in a

quasi-adiabatic calorimeter. For the mechanical test (flexural and compressive tests, EN 

1015-11:1999), mortars specimens with 40 × 40 × 160 mm were produced and tested after 

7, 28 and 90 days cured in standard conditions (temperature = 22ºC and relative humidity = 

65%) (EN 1015-2:1998). Apparent density and water absorption were also determined by 

the immersion technique according to EN 1015-10:1999. Capillary was measured in 

mortars specimens according to EN 1015-18:2002. The crystalline phases of LM and 

mortars were detected by X-ray diffraction – XRD (equipment RIGAKU-Geiger flex 

diffractometer).

can accelerate the setting time and together sulphates can also reduce durability by 

deterioration of microstructure [Rajamma et al., 2009]. LM is basically constituted by 

calcium carbonate (CaCO3). In this case, the LM was collected in a rotary drum without

content what would be good for cement materials production. The major variation in 

weight was seen in the TG/DTA in the range of 800-900ºC around 40% (Figure 5.4). This 

variation represents the thermal decomposition of calcite (CaCO3) and evidences the X-ray 

diffraction result.

5.3.2 Cement lime mud formulations 

5.3.2.1 Fresh state properties 

In general, LM-containing samples modified the rheological behaviour in different 

levels as indicate in the Fig. 5.5. Mortars containing 30% LM showed highest torque and 

yield stress values along the time. The presence of fine particles in the mixtures requires an 

extra dosage of water or superplasticizer additive to keep the workability invariable. 

However, the mentioned factors influence significantly the rheological behaviour [Senff et 

al., 2012; Vaysburd and Emmons, 2004] and the eventual impact due to fine particle is 

hard to be quantified. Is important remind here that the purpose of this experimental 

research is evaluate the real influence of LM, keeping them invariable. The reduction of 

plasticity can be related to the cohesiveness and intense particle attrition. Moreover, the 

presence of agglomeration or tridimensional structures formation can also affect 

particularly the torque and yield stress evolution along the test. In fact, the yield stress was 

the main rheological parameter affected regarding then plastic viscosity that remained 

almost constant at the end of the test.  

As much as lime mud has been added the mortars spread (flow table) has decreased 

(Figure 5.6). The workability of mortars with 30% LM decreased ~ 15% regarding the 

control sample. This fact can be due to the particle cohesion increasing and the remaining 

water content, as mentioned before.  



 
Chapter 5 

90 
 

The same behaviour was observed by Felekoglu et al (2007). The authors testing two types 

of materials (quarry waste limestone power – QLP, and powder produced by direct 

grinding of Limestone – PLP) showed that PLP compositions flowability do not differ 

significantly when compared with reference sample. On the other hand, an accentuate 

flowability decreasing was observed on QLP compositions. They concluded that this fact 

was associated to the powders particles fineness and shape.  Finer powder (PLP) improved 

the spread flow values compared to coarser powder (QLP). The authors recalled that at first 

sight, due to the increased surface area, it seems not logical to expect higher flow values 

from a mixture incorporating finer powders when other variables are kept constant (in 

particular water content). However, just beside particle size, particle surface characteristics 

and surface porosity can play significant roles in designating the fresh state behaviour of 

cement pastes. 

The setting time revealed distinct behavior when LM was added in the mixtures 

(Figure 6). The control sample exhibited the highest period, while 30LM-containing 

mortars reduced ~25%. This fact could be related to water remaining in the cement matrix 

because of the fineness effect of the added particles in the LM composition. In addition, the 

pH of hydration solution can also influence the hydration mechanism in cements [Rajamma 

et al., 2012]. Some other factors can also contribute to the setting anticipation, i.e. the 

presence of Cl- ions on LM. Chlorides exert some influence on the kinetics of hydration, 

becoming higher in cement with extra dosage of LM. However, according to the EN 998-

1:2003 standard, the global content of Cl- ions should not exceed 0.1wt.% of 

mortar/concrete constitution, since the efflorescence formation is often observed, 

compromising the durability of the material [Vaysburd and Emmons, 2004; Kaushik and 

Islam, 1995;  Sanjuan, 1995]. Besides, the reaction between Cl- ions and C3A (tricalcium 

aluminate) or C4AF (tetracalcium aluminoferrite) imply in the chloroaluminates formation 

[Sanjuan, 1995], in which the expansion occurrence increase the porosity that diminishes 

the mechanical strength. 

 The kinetics of hydration results measured by calorimetric are illustrated in the 

Figure 7. The maximum values of exothermic peak were registered after a period of 12h. In 

general, two main peaks can be observed, when the Portland cement is mixed with the 

water [Older, 1998], as follows: (i) the first peak occurs few minutes after contact with 

water, where several Ca2+, ?24SO , Na
+, K+, and OH- ions are release to the aqueous solution 



 
Chapter 5 

91 
 

from gypsum, C3S, C3A and C4AF phases; (ii) the second peaks occur is caused by faster 

crystallization of CH and C-S-H. In both of cases, the presence of LM did not influence 

significant the results regarding the control sample. In fact, developed studies demonstrated 

that cements with small additions of limestone filler could be expected to have better 

performance if they have higher C3S content and at the beginning of hydration, limestone 

do not significantly change the heat of hydration. Vuk et al (2001) also verified that the 

addition of limestone exhibited a strong effect on the initial setting measured by Vicat 

needle. The authors suggested that setting time is related to the type of used clinker and 

fineness cement (higher the limestone addition higher was the fineness of cement).  

5.3.2.2 Hardened state properties 

The mechanical and physical properties of the freshly prepared and hardened 

mortars containing LM are listed in Table 3. Some authors consider the effect of limestone 

on cement to be only physical, taking into account the increase in strength [Soroca  and 

Stem, 1976].  

In this case, the mechanical strength of mortars (7, 28 and 90 days) did not show any 

significant differences between the studied compositions and the control mortar (Table 

5.3). The compressive strength of LM containing samples increased around 8% compared 

to the control sample at 28 days of curing. This difference between samples decreased at 90 

days, but not significantly.  

According to the results obtained for all mechanical strengths, LM does not 

influence in a negative way the mortars properties which suggest that this waste could be 

used as alternative material for conventional fine aggregates replacement. Specifically in 

terms of bulk, the filler effect is obvious, whereby mortar densifies up to an optimum value 

situated between 10 and 20% of LM amount. Nevertheless, it is observed that mixes with 

30% of LM presented a slightly decreasing on this parameter at 28 days of curing. This fact 

was also observed by Bénérina et al. (2005). They proved that a density increase of dry mix 

up to an optical value of filler amount which represents 9 to 16% sand mass replacement 

(depending on the sand), and a regular decrease for higher proportions. They interpreted 

this as filler powder first filling voids around sand grains, up to the optimum and concluded 

that higher filler amounts, those voids being completely filled; filler powder occupies the 

place of sand grains, hence diminishing sand proportion, and consequently the mix density.

 The mortars capillarity was measured for a period of about 90 minutes (Table 5.3). 

The mortars absorption behaviour can be related to the pores content and/or pore sizes 

present in the mortars surface contact area. As much as the LM content increases in the 

cement mortars, lower becomes the capillarity coefficient. Many factors could influence 

this parameter and also it might be associated with the mortars structural arrangement. As 

the LM particles sizes are finer than the used sand, they could fill out same spaces inside 

the cement matrix causing this capillarity decreasing effect. The improvement is ascribed 

to reduced porosity [Benérina et al., 2005]. Regarding the filler effect phenomena, 

Moosberg-Bustnes et al (2004) observed that up to certain amount, the insertion of fine 

filler particles allows denser packing of cement paste and Benachour et al (2008) 

demonstrated that higher filler content increases the total porosity, but the macro-porous 

population diminishes in relation to the micro-porous. 

5.4 Conclusions 

 This paper showed that samples prepared with higher dosages of CaCO3 present in 

the LM makes this waste an interesting material to be used as a fine mineral aggregate in 

cement-based-mortars.    

If flow table and rheometer are used to define mortars formulations the maximum amount 

to be added is restricted. In fact, the rheometer limited the LM content to 30% maximum. 

The yield stress increased with the content of LM and along the test time. The plastic

viscosity did not showed noticeable change after the first 10 min of test, being the yield 

stress the rheological parameter that suffers the highest influence of LC incorporation. The 

spread on table of mortars containing 30% LM decreased about 15% regarding the REF. 

The mechanical strength was not significantly influenced by LM addition. 

Regarding the economic aspects, there would be an opportunity to avoid the landfill of 

thousand tonnes of LM per year due to the expressive waste volume generated and, at the 

same time, savings in a natural raw material such as limestone could be achieved. 

Nevertheless, the moisture content of the LM has to be eliminated in case of using this 

waste as filler in dry-mixed industrial mortar preparation.

Abstract 

The management of bottom ashes generated from biomass combustion in bubbling 

fluidized bed combustors (BFBC) is a relevant environmental issue due to the increasing 

volume of production in recent years. In this work, bottom bed ashes from combustion of 

forest biomass residues in BFBC were used as aggregates in rendering mortar 

formulations. The ashes were characterized considering their particle size distribution and 

chemical/phases composition. When compared to conventional calibrated sands used as 

aggregates, the ashes are composed by particles covering a wider size distribution. SiO2 is 

the major oxide but CaO content is over 10 wt%, suggesting some cementitious activity 

that was not confirmed. The amount of chlorides is significant and then water leaching and 

screening pre-treatment improved the quality of the ashes, despite requiring devoted 

installation and investment. Mortars produced by replacing commercial sand with 

equivalent mass of 50 and 100 wt% of ash show similar characteristics to the reference 

(ash-free) formulation, and satisfied all tested standard specifications. Main worries are 

caused by the variation of water level of the ashes along the time and the need to control 

the concentration of chlorides.

6.1  Introduction 

 Fluidized bed combustion (FBC) is recognized as the most appropriate technology 

for biomass combustion, due to the inherent advantages of low processing temperatures, 

isothermal operating conditions and fuel flexibility. The existing FBC technology at 

industrial scale includes bubbling fluidized bed combustors (BFBC) and circulating 

fluidized bed combustors (CFBC). Among other characteristics, these technologies differ 

in the pattern of gas-solid hydrodynamics in the reactor, the size of the bed particles, the 

heat and mass transfer rates in the reactor, and the temperature and flue gas composition 

profile along the reactor. This in turns influences the characteristics of the ashes produced 

during biomass combustion, and thus, flows of ashes with distinct properties will be 

produced in these installations [Van Loo S &amp;amp; Koppejan, 2008; Yin et al., 2008].  

During biomass combustion in BFBC, two main types of ashes are produced: 

bottom bed ashes and fly ashes. The bottom bed ashes are composed by the sand particles 

(mainly quartz) purged from the original bed, inorganic (soil and small stones) components 

of the fed and the unburnt biomass fraction. In opposition to a grate furnace, where the 

bottom ashes represent the higher percentage of the total ashes produced, in the BFBC the 

bottom bed ashes often represent the lower fraction; the bottom bed ash fraction can 

represent 5%wt [Latva-Somppi et al., 1998], 10%wt [Dahl et al., 2009], 17%wt [Dahl et 

al., 2010], or be as high as 50%wt to 60%wt as often observed in some Portuguese thermal 

plants BFBC [Tarelho et al., 2012]. The bottom ashes are generated upon periodic bed 

discharges that are required to assure the renovation and to avoid agglomeration and 

defluidization, as well to maintain the bed height and the suitable particle size distribution. 

Those parameters are crucial to guarantee proper hydrodynamic conditions of the bubbling 

bed [Van Loo &amp;amp; Koppejan, 2008; Latva Somppi et al., 1998]. 

 The bottom bed ashes from BFBC have the code 100124 [European List of wastes, 

2004] and are normally non-hazardous wastes. They are mostly composed by silica sand 

(quartz) particles, ranging in size from few micrometers until some millimeters, often 

containing a relatively thin (with a few micrometers) coating layer that is mainly composed 

of inorganic glassy material [Vassilev et al., 2010]. 

 Since the emissions from burning of biomass are considered CO2 free, several new 

plants were installed in the past few years [Van Loo &amp;amp; Koppejan, 2008; Tarelho et al., 

2011]. As a consequence, the amount of ashes generated increased considerably.

Controlled landfilling is their common destination but recycling alternatives should be 

pursued. According to Maschio et al (2011), the use of bottom ash in cement, mortars or 

concrete is feasible and can have a beneficial impact on environment. However, products 

must be durable and show suitable mechanical properties, while the release of potential 

hazardous elements should stay below the legal limits. 

 For example, the actual production of industrial pre-mixed mortars exceeds several 

million tons each year, consuming a huge amount of natural but pre-treated raw materials 

(e.g. quarried sand) as aggregates as well as cement or other binders. This activity can be 

looked as a target for the incorporation of bottom ashes, as currently happens with the fly 

ashes generated from the coal combustion in concrete [Ampadu &amp;amp; Torii, 2002]. Maschio et 

al (2011) tested fly and bottom ashes from biomass combustion as cement replacement in 

mortar formulations. Other authors tested coal ash and biomass fly and bottom ashes as 

substitute of natural aggregates in concrete and mortars [Pandey and Sharma, 2000; 

Ravina, 1997; Cheah &amp;amp; Ramli, 2012; Esteves et al., 2012; Kim &amp;amp; Lee, 2011; Kim et al., 

2012]. Fresh and hardened properties were evaluated, including the rheological behaviour 

and water demand, mechanical strength, air permeability, and resistance to carbonation. 

Under limited and controlled conditions, the solutions are promising. 

 In the actual study, the conventional aggregate (sand, herein named S) used in 

industrial rendering-mortars was substituted by the bottom ash produced from the burning 

of biomass in BFBC. The need of pre-treatment operations before incorporation, namely 

washing and screening/sieving, was also evaluated. The leaching of chlorides is crucial to 

avoid deleterious effects on the durability and also to control the setting behaviour 

[Scherer, 2006; EN 998-2:2003]. At the same time, the adjustment of particle size 

distribution of the aggregates is also relevant to control the workability [Senff et al., 2009] 

of the mix and the compactness of the bodies, which determines their mechanical strength 

[Senff et al., 2011]. 

6.2  Methodology 

6.2.1 Thermal power plant characteristics 

 The bottom bed ashes here studied were collected from a 50 MWth BFBC, located 

in the centre of Portugal. It burns forest biomass residues, namely eucalyptus bark and 



Chapter 6

remains from logging activities. The temperature of the bubbling bed ranges from 800ºC to 

900ºC, while the O2 concentration in the flue gas varies between 4%v/v and 7%v/v (dry 

basis). The ash was directly collected in the ashtray of the combustor, schematically 

represented in Figure 6. 1. 

 
Figure 6. 1. Schematic view of the ash flows generated in the BFBC, including the basic operations 

implemented for potential further valorization. 

6.2.2 Raw material characterization 

 The bottom bed ash was used in two different conditions, as shown in Figure 6. 2: 

(i) just sieved (between 250 to 1000µ m) in a lab-scale equipment to adjust the particle size 

distribution to the one of the commercial aggregate (sand) normally used in mortar 

formulations; the ash was here identified as BA (Bottom Ash); 

(ii) pre-treated (washed and sieved), intending to diminish the content of soluble salts 

(namely chlorides) – identified as TBA (Treated Bottom Ash). The treatment was 

performed in a continuous way in an industrial plant that prepares natural sand as aggregate 

for the construction industry. The process includes a continuous shower that fixes the L/S 

(liquid to solid) ratio = 2, and has running capacity = 10 ton/h; the washing solution is then 

treated by sedimentation to be reused in further washing steps.

Figure 6. 2. Methodology of processing bottom ashes for rendering-mortars production 

 The chemical composition of ashes and other of the other constituents was 

determined by X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy –XRF (Panalytical Axios spectrometer), 

while the crystalline phases were detected by X-ray diffraction – XRD (equipment 

RIGAKU-Geiger flex diffractometer). BA and TBA particles were also observed by 

Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS HR-

FESEM Hitachi SU-70). The loss of ignition of the ashes was estimated upon firing at 

1000°C. The particle size distribution of the coarse aggregate fraction (S2) and of the ashes 

was obtained by sieving [EN 933-1: 2000]. 

6.2.3 Mortar formulation and characterization 

 Prepared formulations are presented in Table 6. 1. Aggregate’s fines are composed 

by limestone filler (LSF) and S1 sand. The preparation of mortars included: (i) water 

weighing and addition to the solids; (ii) mixing for 30 seconds at a low rotation speed (60 

rpm); (iii) stopping for 1 min; (iv) mixing again for 1 min at the same low speed and, (v) 

keep the mixture in stand by for 10 minutes before testing the fresh state properties. 

Properties evaluated in the fresh condition are listed in Table 6. 2. Then samples were 

cured at 20ºC and 65%RH, in a climate room. Finally, the hardened mortars were 

characterised by following, when existing, standard procedures (see Table 6. 2).

Table 6. 1. Mix proportions tested. 

 

Table 6. 2. Standards used in the characterisation of the mortars. 

 

 To estimate the concentration of chlorides leached from cured specimens, samples 

were broken in small pieces and then milled and sieved (&amp;lt;125µ m). After drying at 105ºC, 

the powders (10g) were immersed in distilled water (100mL) and the leaching process was 

conducted according to EN 1015-17:2000. After 24h, the solution was filtered and the 

concentration of chlorides was measured by potenciometry, by using a chloride selective 

ion electrode. 

 Two prismatic specimens (25x25x285mm) from each formulation were used to 

measure the dynamic elastic modulus (E), by determining the longitudinal resonant 

frequency and accounting for the density and length of the sample. The measurement was 

conducted with an Oscilloscope – HAMEG HM303-4 (30Hz) coupled to a power amplifier 

(LDS  PA25E) and a current source 4102C (DYTRAN Instruments). The product 

validation was done by comparing the characteristics of the samples with current product 

specifications, listed in Table 6. 3.

 Comparing with values used in the characterisation of coal fly ash, we are far below 

the limit of 1.4 that defines hydraulic activity (Maschio et al., 2011; Matjie et al., 2008). 

Even so, some detected phases are commonly found on cement, e.g. larnite (Ca2SiO4). 

Quartz, calcite (CaCO3), and microcline (KAlSi3O8) were also detected. 

 The loss on ignition (LOI) of BA and TBA were found to be 2.1% and 1.3%, 

respectively, revealing that burning conditions were efficient. The decrease observed on 

pre-treated ash is a result of the removal of soluble components (salts) and of some organic 

matter initially present in the material. 

 
Figure 6. 3. Low magnification SEM views of particles (left) and corresponding EDS mapping for Ca (right 

side in red) on the surface layer: a - conventional sand; b - BA; c – TBA 

According to the EN 998-1:2003 standard, the global content of Cl- ions should not 

exceed 0.1wt.% of mortar/concrete constitution. The decrease of Cl- concentration (about 

60%) in TBA ashes (Table 4), when compared to BA, reflects the washing efficiency of the 

applied industrial treatment. The presence of chlorides tends to anticipate the setting 

process [Nilforoushan &amp;amp; Sharp, 1995; Kaushik &amp;amp; Islam, 1995; Makaratat et al., 2011], but 



Chapter 6

cause then strong deleterious effects on hardened bodies. Formation of efflorescence is 

often observed, compromising the durability of the material [Vaysburd &amp;amp;Emmons, 2004; 

Kaushik &amp;amp; Islam, 1995]. Additionally, Cl- ions tend to react with C3A (tricalcium 

aluminate) and C4AF (tetracalcium aluminoferrite) phases forming chloroaluminates 

(Sanjuan, 1997) with associated expansion and porosity enhancement that diminishes the 

mechanical strength.  Anyway, TBA shows chloride concentration below that of cement 

(Table 6. 4), and then those problems are not predicted in the prepared mortars. 

The particle size distribution of the components is one of the basic criteria considered by 

mortar producers, in order to adjust the mixing process and to improve the compactness of 

the samples. The fine sand (S1) is mostly constituted by particles having dimensions 

between 63 and 300 µ m, while the average size of coarse aggregate particles (S2) is 0.5 

mm. Its size distribution is somewhat broad; including particles smaller than 0.125 mm and 

a significant portion above 1 mm. BA particles are all comprised between 0.25 and 1mm, 

but TBA ones presents around 10 wt% of its particles above 1.0 mm. It is because the 

laboratorial sieving process is more controlled than the industrial process. 

Figure 6. 3 shows of cross section SEM low magnification views of bottom ash 

particles. For comparison, conventional S2 sand particles were also analysed. Images 

confirm the dimensional and shape similitude between S2 conventional sand particles and 

the ashes. EDS analysis reveals the presence of a Ca-rich coating layer (in red) in BA and 

TBA particles, denoting the occurrence of surface reactions between inorganic biomass-

bearing components and the sand. The detected calcium silicate and calcite phases are 

probably concentrated in the skin. 

6.3.2 Characterization of mortars 

Fresh state properties 

 Figure 6. 4 shows the setting time of the prepared mortars. BA and TBA containing 

formulations tend to show the beginning of setting slightly anticipated in comparison to the 

reference (REF) mix. The open time (period between the beginning and final setting) is 

also shorter, particularly on mortars where S2 was fully replaced by ashes (BA100 and 

TBA100). Apart some minor influence of the compactness of the mixes, the presence of 

chlorides might be the main responsible for the changes [Demirbas, 2004; Makaratat et al., 

2011; Nilforoushan &amp;amp; Sharp, 1995]. 



Chapter 6

Figure 6. 4. Beginning and final setting time of the mortars. 

Table 6. 5. Entrained air content and water retentivity shown by the mortars. 

 

 Bulk density and values of spread in the flow table of mortars are presented in 

Figure 6. 5. Differences on the average bulk density are minor, but ash-containing 

formulations tend to be slightly more compact. Ash particles are relatively smaller than S2 

ones and the mixes are thicker. As a consequence, the flowability of ash-containing mixes 

tends to decrease. Anyway differences are minor and easily adjustable if required. 

Specifications recommend the preparation of mixes that show spread values between 140 

and 170 mm (Table 6. 3). 

 The replacement of S2 by BA and TBA did not influence meaningfully the air 

content and the water retentivity of the renderings (Table 6. 5). The low samples standard 

deviation indicates that the data tends to be very close to the expected. They were 

comprehended between 17.5 to 19.5% in case of air content and 95 to 97.6% in case of 

water retentivity. It is observed that the air content of samples tends to decrease with the 

lower value higher value SD* lower value higher value SD*

replacement material when compared to REF. In case of water retentivity, it decreases 

when BA and TBA is added in relation to REF, but increases between than when the 

content of replaced material increases. 

 
Figure 6. 5. Apparent density and values of spread in the flow table of the mortars. 

 Hardened state properties 

 Figure 6. 6 shows the amount of chlorides extracted from the mortars cured for 90 

days. Hypothetically, the increase of BA and TBA levels should enhance the concentration 

of chlorides, especially when non-treated BA ashes are used. 

 However, the extraction of soluble components from a solid matrix is strongly 

influenced by physical and microstructural parameters, which certainly determine the 

access and percolation of the leaching media through the material. As expected, REF 

shows the lowest level of chlorides, and an increase is noticed for samples containing 50% 

ash. The pre-treatment of the ash seems efficient in minimising the contents of chlorides 

extracted from the mortars, particularly in those containing 100% replacement. Figure 6. 7 

shows values of compressive strength of specimens cured for 7 and 28 days. In general 

values tend to increase with the use ashes but differences are minor (0.1-0.3 MPa) in 

comparison to REF. This slight increase could result from the better compactness of the 

samples.

 Anyway, all samples comply with the standard required limit of 3.5 MPa, also 

represented (dotted line) in Figure 6. 7. We also determined the dynamic elasticity modulus 

(E) and values are shown in Figure 6. 8. This property expresses the stiffness of the 

material and like other mechanical properties depends on the microstructural development 

of the mortar that is controlled by the hydration extent, and by the arrangement of particles 

(compactness). Morphological details like size, shape and rugosity of grains are then 

important.

expressive (9.1-10.65 GPa) but tends to increase in ash-containing mortars (BA and TBA). 

This tendency follows the observed relative differences in the compressive strength.

value. 

 
Figure 6. 9. Values of unrestrained shrinkage of mortars along the time. Minimum and maximum values are 

shown at 28 days curing. 

Finally, the unrestrained shrinkage of mortars registered upon curing was also 

evaluated (see Figure 6. 9), since the control of this parameter is relevant to avoid cracking. 

Values are strongly dependent on the microstructure development upon curing [Thomas &amp;amp; 

Jennings, 2003; Jennings &amp;amp; Xi, 1994; Garboczi, 1993]. The measured shrinkage is the 

resultant of autogenous and drying contributions. The autogenous shrinkage is due to the 



Chapter 6 

111 
 

self-desiccation of the mixture during hydration, while the drying shrinkage occurs due to 

the evaporation of water from the mixture to the environment. Registered values after 28 

days curing give the following sequence: TBA100&gt;BA100&gt;BA50&gt;TBA50&gt;REF (Figure 

6. 9) meaning that the use of ashes as S2 replacement tends to induce stronger dimensional 

changes. Shrinkage of TBA100 and BA100 mortars is, respectively, ~19% and ~13% 

higher than that of REF formulation, but even so they stay below the specified limit. In 

comparison to S2 aggregate, the ashes might show (incipient) hydraulic characteristics due 

to the Ca-rich surface layer and to the presence of calcium silicates. This means that ash 

particles are not as inert as the conventional sand. 

6.4 Conclusions 

 The use of bottom ash generated by burning biomass in bubbling fluidized 

combustors as replacement of conventional sand used as coarse aggregate of industrial 

rendering-mortars is technologically feasible. In general this substitution does not induce 

negative impact on the relevant properties and formulations accomplish with required 

specifications. The as-collected ash shows suitable particle size distribution and only the 

chlorides content deserve control and potential treatment. The simple washing process 

industrially tested revealed to be very effective in reducing the amount (by about 60%) of 

soluble chlorides in the ash. This application could avoid sending thousand tons of ashes 

for landfilling, with obvious environmental advantages. Moreover, economic savings might 

be achieved by mortar producers, due to the replacement of treated and calibrated sand. 

Further tests covering durability issues of formulations produced under optimized 

conditions (including the ash content) should be performed in the future to validate this 

recycling alternative.

Abstract 

Bottom bed ash (BA) from forest biomass residues combustion generated in bubbling 

fluidised bed combustor (BFBC) was chemically, mineralogically and physically 

characterized and evaluated according to Decision 2003/33/CE and its landfill 

classification was determined based on criteria established by European and Portuguese 

legislation. Aiming to investigate its potential for being used as alternative aggregate in 

cementitious-adhesive mortar (CAM), formulations were produced by replacing 

commercial sand by equivalent mass of 25, 50 and 100 wt% of bottom ash. CAM 

properties were measured in fresh and hardened conditions. The bottom ash effect on the 

tensile adhesion strength (TAS) was investigated on samples cured under four distinct 

conditions. Macro and microstructural analysis were carried out to identify the influence of 

wetting capability and transference area in the TAS. Results revealed that high ashes levels 

cause relevant changes in TAS, particularly those evaluated after 30 minutes of open time. 

However, within reasonable limits, the effects are minor and acceptable. This recycling 

route seems feasible, since it combines environmental benefits with economic advantages 

for the adhesive mortar producers in the sense they can use BA as raw material, saving a 

natural resource; this recycling option is also important since can avoid one waste 

landfilling.

7.1  Introduction 

 To supply the demand for energy of national power grid, Portugal has been 

operating forestry biomasses fuelled thermal power plants (TPP) and forestry biomass co-

fired power plants. This country has an important set of biomass TPP and cogeneration 

plants, mostly with bubbling fluidized bed combustors (BFBC, 30 to 120 MWth). Most of 

these industrial units are using as fuel a mixture of residual forest biomass (RFB – resultant 

from activities of industries, i.e. pulp and paper mill, such as the preparation of feedstock 

and forest maintenance) acquired to local or regional forestry harvesting operators working 

around the location of the TPP. However, most of this RFB is delivered to the thermal 

plants and used as fuel without a proper quality control of the biomass, and related to 

inappropriate practices during RFB harvesting at the forest. 

The main thermal and cogeneration power plants in Portugal use bubbling fluidized 

bed combustion and a variety of forest biomass residues is mainly derived of Eucalyptus 

globulus and Pinus pinaster [Tarelho et al., 2012]. The combustion of forest biomass 

generates ashes as solid wastes. Presently, most of the biomass ash produced in thermal 

power plants is either disposal of in landfill or recycled on agricultural or forest fields, and 

most times those go on without any form of control. On the other hand, concerning that 

disposal cost of biomass ashes is arising, and that biomass ash volumes are also increasing 

worldwide, a sustainable ash management has to be established [Rajamma et al., 2009]. A 

schematic view of the ash flows generated in a bubbling fluidised bed combustor is 

presented in figure 1. This same figure also describes the basic operations implemented for 

potential further valorization of generated wastes. According to Obernberger et al (1997), 

for achieving a sustainable biomass to energy strategy it is essential to close the material 

fluxes and to integrate the biomass ashes within the natural cycles. Approximately 480 

million tons of ash from biomass combustion is being generated worldwide annually 

[Vassilev et al., 2012]. This quantity is becoming comparable to that of coal ash, namely 

780 million ton produced per year at present [Izquierdo and Queirol, 2012]. Due to the 

strict environmental regulations imposed by the environmental regulatory bodies, 

landfilling of forest biomass ashes has becoming more difficult and this scenario is an 

opportunity to study and perspective diverse recycling ways for such waste [Cheah and 

Ramli, 2012]. The ash characteristics are influenced by biomass characteristics, the soil 

conditions where the biomass has been collected, the combustion techniques, the operation 



Chapter 7

conditions during combustion (temperature, stoichiometry, air staging, and additives) and 

the gas cleaning systems [Vassilev et al., 2010; Latva-Somppi et al., 1998; Dahl et al., 

2009; Steenary and Fedje, 2010].  

The specific ash researched in this work has been generated when periodic discharges of 

the bed are performed, namely bottom ash. The periodic discharges are performed to 

maintain the bed particle size distribution and to avoid bed agglomeration (a phenomenon 

associated with inappropriate fluidization which could lead to the fluidised bed collapse 

[Bartels et al., 2008]). In general, the relative high level of inert material present in the 

biomass used in Portuguese BFBC plants enhances the frequency of bed discharges, 

meaning that bottom ashes have low residence time (&lt;5 days) in the BFBC when compared 

with results reported for other installations using BFBC [Latva-Somppi et al., 1998; 

Tarelho et al., 2011]. The bottom ash from BFBC has the code 100124 according to 

European List of Wastes and the search for recycling or reuse alternatives of such residue 

is an hot topic and a serious need. A reasonable number of recent investigations report the 

use of ashes for distinct applications: masonry products, low and medium-strength 

concrete, road pavement, blended cements, adsorbents, and ceramics [Rajammaet al., 2009; 

Menéndez et al., 2014; NCASI, 1993; Wang et al., 2008; Alonso and Palomo, 2001; 

Rajamma et al., 2012; Yip et al., 2005;  Wang and Baxter, 2007; Siddique, 2010]. 

However, as far as we know, the use of bottom ash in CAM is not well documented. 

Cementitious-adhesive is a technical product, namely a mixed-binder mortar specially 

made from a combination of lime, sand, and water, as well as from other types of 

cementitious products, mainly composed of sand and different mineral fillers, inorganic or 

organic binders, and additives depending on the use. This product must assure the adhesion 

between tiles (ceramic or ornamental stones) and the concrete wall. Cementitious-adhesive 

mortars (CAM) role is particularly challenging for the fixation of large and dense samples, 

as occurred in the last decades due to the evolution on tile industry [Ançid et al., 2005; 

Wetzel et al., 2012]. Their performance depends on the content, quality and the interaction 

between the components [Mansur et al., 2009; Öhama, 1995; Jenni et al., 2005; Jenni et al., 

2006]. CAM hold up well to outdoor temperatures, but dries hard and may be prone to 

cracking or expansion if not applied properly or if subjected to temperature extremes or 

ground heave.

Schulze (1999) tested the influence of water-cement ratio and of the cement content 

on the properties of polymer-modified mortars. Within certain limits, the water-cement 

ratio exerts a smaller effect on the adhesion strength of the material, but the relative 

amount of cement in the mixture is a crucial parameter. In the fresh state condition, the 

generation of a skin (film) on the external surface of the mortar having suitable gluing 

properties drastically influences the bond strength between the adhesive and the tile 

[Bühler et al., 2013]. This mechanism is rather complex and its study is far from its 

conclusion. 

In the present work, raw bottom ash from forest residues combustion was 

characterized as received and its particle size distribution was compared with 2 bottom 

ashes generated in Thermal Power Plants (TPP) with the same type of technology (BFBC). 

The aim of this part of the work was to assess the influence of biomass characteristics in 

the bottom ash quality, namely particle size distribution and also to report the significant 

bottom ash high level amount generated when compared to other plants and finally 

emphasizes the need of treatment of bottom ash to be used as replacement material in the 

construction sector. After, the tested bottom ash was evaluated according to Decision 

2003/33/CE and Decree-Law nº 152/2002 (Decree-Law nº 152/2002 was repealed by 

Decree-Law nº 183/2009 and rectified by Decree-Law nº 84/2011). The waste 

classification for landfilling purposes was then established.  

In general, the bottom bed ash from a BFBC are composed mostly by silica (quartz) 

sand particles, with particle size from the few micrometers until some millimeters, being 

the mean particle size (around 0.950 mm) very similar to that of conventional silica sand 

used in CAM formulations. Considering this fact, the bottom ash from a BFBC was treated 

(by sieving) and tested as partial replacement of the conventional sand used in CAM. The 

bottom ash treatment consisted in sieving in order to remove coarse (&gt; 1.00 mm) and fine 

(&amp;lt;0.25 mm) particles, that are often introduced in the combustor mixed with the biomass 

fuel, that can contain important amounts of inert material (soil and little stones) mixed. The 

tests were performed in the fresh and hardened state. The wetting capability and 

transference capacity of fresh mortars, as well as the ultimate tensile adhesion strength 

(TAS) developed upon curing in distinct conditions, was evaluated. Economic savings 

might be achieved by cementitious-adhesive producers, due to the replacement of

expensive calibrated sand, considering that at least four thousand tonnes per year of this 

sand is used only by one mortar producer [Modolo et al., 2013].

7.2  Methodology 

 Raw bottom ash here studied was collected from a 90 MWth BFBC (bubbling 

fluidised bed combustor, namely Thermal Power Plant 3 (TPP_3)) located in the centre of 

Portugal. It burns forest biomass residues, namely eucalyptus bark and remains from 

logging activities. The temperature of the bubbling bed ranges from 800ºC to 900ºC. The 

raw BA was directly collected in the ashtray of the combustor, schematically represented in 

Figure 7.1.  

7.2.1  Characterization of raw BA 

 Particle size distribution of BA from TPP_1, 2 and 3 were obtained by manually 

sieving according to EN 933-1: 2000. The chemical composition of raw BA from TPP_3 

was determined by X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy –XRF (Panalytical Axios 

spectrometer), while the crystalline phases were detected by X-ray diffraction – XRD 

(RIGAKU-Geiger flex diffractometer). Raw BA was observed by optical microscopy

(Leica EZ4 HD). Laser diffraction using Coulter LS analyzer was also used to obtain the 

particle size distribution. Gravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TG/DTA – 

Setaram, Labsys) were used to evaluate the amount of unburnt (organic) components. 

Concerning the presence of metals, the hazardous potential of BA was determined by using 

two techniques: (i) digestion with aqua-regia (HCl:HNO3, 3:1, v/v) and (ii) leaching 

according to DIN 38414-S4. In this case the as received waste was used to prepare an 

eluate (100 g of dried material was immersed in 1 liter of distilled water). The suspension 

was stirred for 24 hours and then filtered. Then, 100 mL of such cleaned eluate was 

titrated. Metal contents were determined by ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma) in an 

apparatus Jobin Yvon - Sequential NSPL upgrade model (J4/200). Chlorides were 

estimated by the Argentometric method (CHLORIDE, 4500-Cl-; Standard Methods 

Committee, 1997), while sulphates were estimated by gravimetry (SULFATE, 4500-SO4
-2; 

ignition of residue, Standard Methods Committee, 1997). In this case, sample was dried, 

weighed and dissolved in diluted HCl. Barium chloride solution was added in excess to 

precipitate barium sulphate, and the precipitate was digested in the hot solution (between 

80 – 90ºC). The precipitate was filtered through a paper filter and was then ignited (at 800 

ºC for 4 hours) for complete combustion. Difference between the weight of the sample and 

of the precipitate gives the percentage of sulphates. 

7.2.2 Characterization of materials used in cementitious-adhesive application 

 Raw BA from TPP_3 was sieved (between 250 and 1000µm) in a lab-scale 

equipment to adjust the particle size distribution to the one of the commercial aggregate 

(sand) that will be replaced normally used in this type of mortars; Raw Bottom Ash was 

here identified as BA. Particle size distribution of CAM components were obtained by 

manually sieving according to EN 933-1: 2000. The chemical composition of BA, 

Ordinary Portland Cement type I, S1 (finer sand) and S2 (coarse sand) particles was also 

determined using were also X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy –XRF (Panalytical Axios 

spectrometer), while the crystalline phases were detected by X-ray diffraction – XRD 

(RIGAKU-Geiger flex diffractometer). 

7.2.3 CAM formulations and characterization 



Chapter 7

 The formulations studied are presented in Table 7.1. The raw materials brand and 

content were suggested by the company which intents to improve forward the valorization 

solution using its own specific formulations. The copolymer powder is a vinyl acetate and 

ethylene which is dispersible in water and has good saponification resistance. CEM II/A-L 

42.5R is used in lower quantity and its function is to improve the cementitious-adhesive 

behaviour in aggressive environments. Apart from CEM I, the fine sand (S1) is the 

aggregate with highest content used in these cementitious-adhesive formulations and its 

function is related with the final product texture and type of application. The water content 

of samples was defined according to the workability of the adhesives observed through the 

slip (results comprehended from 0 to 1.0 mm). The adhesive’s preparation was developed 

according to EN 12004: 2007+A1 (Adhesives for tiles - Requirements, evaluation of 

conformity, classification and designation). It includes: 

(a) Hand mixing the water with the solids for 15 seconds;  

(b) Mixing for 30 seconds at low rotation speed (60 rpm);  

(c) Stopping for 1 minute;  

(d) Mixing again for 1 minute under the same low speed and,  

(e) Keep the mixture in stand by for 2 minutes;  

(f) Mixing for the last 15 seconds at low rotation speed. After mixing, the fresh paste was 

applied on concrete plates in two steps: as a first contact layer with a thickness 

corresponding to the surface base layer (approximately 2 mm), which then was trowelled 

repeatedly with a toothed notched trowel (profiled 6x6x6 mm). The standards used in the 

characterisation of mortars are presented in Table 7.2.

 This parameter determines the resistance to slip of tiles applied to combed adhesive 

layer on a vertical surface. It is measured through the downward movement of the tile 

(weight = 200g), corresponding to a 20kg/m2. The distance between the top (where the tile 

was applied) and the place where the tile stopped after 10 minutes of testing is considered 

the final result, given in millimetres [EN 1308: 2007]. 

Wetting capability and transference 

 The wetting capability is estimated as the contact area (%) between the 

mortar/adhesive and a glassy sheet of 25 cm2. It gives a qualitative estimation of the 

capacity shown by the adhesive mortar to embed the surface of a ceramic or glass tile. A 

squared piece of glass (5x5x0.5 cm) is pushed by a metal piece of 2 kg against the combed 

adhesive during 30 seconds; afterwards and before removing the glass, the area covered by 

the adhesive is visually inspected and determined by an image editing software that allows 

the calculation of specific selected areas. The test is repeated 10, 20 and 30 min after the 

adhesive layer has been combed. This test is described by the European Standard EN 

1347:2007. 

Transference measurements 

 After removal the glassy piece from the substrate with the adhesive, the quantity 

of mortar that was transferred to the tile is measured given the so called transference value. 

The evolution of the tiles surface coverage by the adhesive mortar with the curing time 

gives an estimation of the adhesion loss due to hardening process. Values were correlated 

with tensile adhesion strength evaluated after an open time of 30 minutes. Again, the area 

values were estimated by using the same imaging software. 

Tensile Adhesion Strength – pull-off test 

 The adhesive strength is determined as the maximum tensile strength supported by 

the material under a load that is applied perpendicular to the surface being tested. The pull-

off test is classified as a near-to-surface, partially destructive method [Ramos et al., 2012]. 

The tensile load is applied by means of a defined pull-head plate glued to the testing 

surface. 



Chapter 7 

122 
 

 A thin layer of the adhesive is applied on the concrete slab (substrate) with a 

straight edge trowel. On the top of this first layer another thicker layer of the adhesive is 

deposited and combed with a notched trowel (having 6 x 6 mm notches at 12 mm centers). 

It was hold at an angle of approximately 60° to the substrate at a right angle to one edge of 

the slab and drawn across the slab parallel to that edge (in a straight line). After 5 min, the 

ceramic tiles (of porcelain type, having water absorption ? 0,5 % by mass, unglazed and 

covered with plain, matt glaze, with dimensions of 5x5x0.5 cm) were laid in, loaded with 2 

kg for 30 seconds one by one. The minimum adhesion defined by CEN specifications (EN 

1348: 2007) is ? 0.5 MPa for samples cured under distinct conditions (see below). 

(i) Dry curing (28d, 23ºC, 50%RH): samples are cured for 28 days in a climate chamber 

(23ºC±2 and 50%±5 relative humidity). These conditions are considered the standard ones. 

Then, pull-head plates are bonded (square metallic plates, with dimensions of 50 x 50 mm 

and thickness of 10 mm) to the tiles by using a proper high strength adhesive resin (epoxy). 

After more 24 h storage in standard conditions the tensile adhesion strength is evaluated 

under a load that is applied at constant rate of 250 N/s. 

(ii) Wet curing (7d, 23ºC, 50%RH + 21d, inside water at temperature of 20ºC±2) : now the 

samples cured for 7 days in standard conditions were then immersed in water (at 20ºC ±2) 

for another 21 days. Before testing the adhesion, according to the conditions already 

described, pieces are wiped with a cloth. 

(iii) Heat curing (14d, 23ºC, 50%RH + 14d, 70ºC +1d, 23 º C, 50% RH): samples are 

previously cured for 14 days in standard conditions and then are placed inside an air-

circulating oven at 70 ± 3°C for another 14 days. 

(iv) TAS after 30’ open time (28d, 23ºC, 50%RH): the open time is defined as the period 

during which the tiles might be applied to the adhesive (i.e., the time during which the 

adhesive surface remains “tacky” to the touch) [Bentz et al., 2008; Oberste-Padtberg and 

Sieksmeier, 2007]. Measurements were performed according to the EN1346:1999 standard. 

This means that samples are cured for 28 days in standard conditions, then the adhesive 

mortar is applied and samples are tested after 30 minutes (the designated open time). 

Failure patterns 



Chapter 7 

123 
 

 The failure patterns of tested samples were also observed. AF-T indicates failure 

between tile and adhesive, CF-S is used to define the cohesive failure at the interface 

between adhesive and substrate and CF-A defines the failure within the adhesive layer as 

specified by EN 12004: 1999. Failure patterns are schematically illustrated in Figure 7.2.

7.3  Results and Discussion 

7.3.1  Characterization of raw BA 

 Figure 7.3 presents the particle size distribution of raw BA (before sieving), BA 

(sieved) and the other two sands used in the whole work. S1 is the finest sand used in the 

formulations and S2 the coarse one, having the mean size around 400 µm and 1025 µm, 

respectively, while BA (before sieving) and BA (before sieving) is 900 µm and 950 µm, 

respectively. In case of BA (before sieving) the existence of almost 60% of particles 

diameter between 0.25 – 1.0 mm is reasonable in the light of the fact that, in fluidized bed 

boiler furnaces, the combustion bed material, silica sand, consists of calibrated sand which 

must be kept constant to guaranty the height of bed. From the utilization point of view, 

these particles (between 0.25 and 1.0 mm) can be of great potential because of their similar

particle size with the calibrated sand used as aggregate for the tested type of cementitious-

adhesive. Other types of bottom ash [Dahl et al., 2009; Dahl et al., 2010] can differ 

significantly in particle size range compared with the BA tested here, thus suggesting that 

in those cases lower amounts of particles from those ashes can be used for this application. 

The percentage of material (particles) retained in the sieve with 2 mm mesh is in the order 

of 1% and in the sieve 0.25 mm mesh is in order of 65%wt [Dahl et al., 2009]. 

Nevertheless, an appropriate treatment (sieving) could guarantee the use of a fraction of 

bottom ash from bubbling fluidised bed combustors in mortars formulations by 

replacement of the conventional sand as aggregate, because they contain always an 

important fraction of particles with size range between 0.25 and 1.0 mm, and thus of 

interest for these formulations. Also, considering the typical operating conditions of 

bubbling fluidised bed combustors using residual forest biomass as fuel, the chemical 

composition of bottom ash, for example, in terms of organic matter, soluble salts, 

chlorides, seems to be within the standard specifications of the material to be used as 

aggregate and it is not expected the promotion of deleterious effects in this type of products 

(cement-based mortars) [Modolo et al., 2013]. Considering this fact, raw BA was sieved, 

characterized and tested as aggregate partially replacing S2 in CAM formulations (figure 

7.3). The enrichment with fine and coarse particles relative to the original sand bed in the 

Portuguese TPPs can be explained in result of characteristics of forest biomass residues 

used as fuel, namely the inert material. So, this fact is completely associated with the 

biomass quality, mainly related with stones and soil particles contamination of forest 

residues during harvesting transport and their handling [Modolo et al., 2014]. Another 

concern when compare both scenery is about ashes amount. Dahl et al (2010)] referred that 

TPP (246MW) produced about 15.430 tonnes of ashes in 2009, which 2580 tonnes was 

bottom ash. Meanwhile, the specific Portuguese TPP (90MWth) where the studied BA is 

generated produces around 6.000 tonnes/year what demonstrates the strong influence of 

biomass quality on the bottom ash characteristics mainly in terms of amount. Decision 

2003/33/CE establishes for waste acceptance in each landfill type (inert, non-hazardous 

and hazardous) based on both the characteristics of the waste and leachate acquired by EN 

14405  and refers that each member state must define which L/S ratio to use. In Portugal, 

the criteria for landfill deposition of inert and hazardous wastes are those of Decision 

2003/33/CE with ratio L/S of 10l/kg. For non-hazardous waste, the criteria are defined on

Decision 2003/33/CE nor Decree-Law 152/2002 establish legal limits for Mn and Fe, but 

both elements were quantified together others minor elements objectifying information 

report. The results for minor elements are presented in figure 7.4 and legal limit for waste 

acceptance in each landfill type and BA results are presented in table 7.3.  

 

Figure 7. 3. Grain size distribution determined according to EN 933:1/2000. 

 
Comparing values obtained with the limits stated in Decision 2003/33/CE, can 

verify that values of Cd (0.77 mg/kg), Cr total (9.1 mg/kg), Ni (3.85 mg/kg) and Zn (17.8 

mg/kg) exceed the legal limit for inert wastes. The pH (12) and nitrates concentration (2.5 

mg/l) are near the limits defined for non-hazardous wastes, so deserves control and 

precaution to not be surpassed. Recycling this waste in cement- based mortars/concrete, as 

a replacement of natural aggregates, might be an interesting alternative, since it is perfectly 

aligned with EU directives recommending solutions to transform the waste into a resource 

[Horizon 2020, 2014; Schiessler et al., 2007]. The use of cementitious-adhesive mortars

The chemical composition of raw BA, BA, S1, S2 and Ordinary Portland Cement 

type I is given in table 7.4. Mineralogical composition of BA, S1 and S2 is presented on 

figure 7.6. The bottom ashes are basically composed by a mixture of the original bed (silica 

sand - quartz) and by inorganic impurities (forest soil and small stones) included in the 

biomass. These respond for the presence of Al, Na and K oxides, introduced as feldspars 

(i.e., microcline – figure 7.6), or micas. In the TGA, the highest weight loss was registered 

between 600 and 800 ºC, resulting from decarbonatation reactions.

another endothermic event was detected at 573 °C and can be attributed to the ?-? quartz 

polymorphic change. The total mass loss reached about 2%. This relatively low value and 

the absence of expressive exothermic reactions in the range 250-500 °C confirm the 

absence of organic matter. Otherwise, the remaining unburnt matter should decompose in 

that temperature region. 

7.3.2  Characterization of materials used in cementitious-adhesive application 

 Ozkahraman and Isik (2005) highlighted that the fundamental requirement of the 

tile adhesive mortar is its adherence and durability and proved that the properties of 

adhesives are affected by the chemical and mineralogical composition of the aggregates. In 

figure 7.6 (XRD results) It can be observed that S1 and S2 are basically quartz-sand and Ba 

presented approximately 90% SiO2 in its composition. Other 10% of crystalline substances 

are minerals which do not represent a negative aspect on the proposed application, calcite i. 

e., is a material frequently used in several types of cements and cement-mortars, as filler or 

as raw material used in clinker production. The calcium silicate mineral Larnite found is 

vestiges.  

7.3.3 Characterization of CAM 

Values of slip and apparent density determined on adhesive mortars are presented 

in table 7.5.The apparent density tends to slightly increase with BA content in the mortars. 

This fact can be associated to the particle size distribution of the ash-containing mixtures, 

that when S2 is replaced by BA produces mixtures that require less amount of water to 

assure a similar workability (see BA50 and BA100 formulations) leading to a better final 

compactness.  

Figure 7.7 illustrates the wetability of the glassy surface shown by the tested 

formulations as a function of exposure time (10, 20, 30 and 40 min after application). It is 

quite evident the gradual weatability lost along the time. According to Bühler et al (2013) 

there is the formation of a top skin that hardens quickly than the interior of the material and 

it will reduce its deformation and gluing capacity. The formation of such layer depends on 

the mortar formulation, nature of the substrate, application technique, and also by the 

climatic. It is found that after 20 minutes REF sample already denotes deficiencies in 

covering the tile surface, while BA-containing mortars show good wettability. The 



Chapter 7 

 

130 
 

homogeneous particle size distribution of BA associated with the roughness of its surface 

might explain this increase. Indeed, less finer particles demanding less water retard skin 

formation, leading to better transference capability. Bühler et al (2013) also confirmed this 

fact by testing different mortar formulations and observing that water content could retard 

the skin formation.  

 
Figure 7. 7. Photograph of glass plate embedded during the wetting capability test of cementitious-adhesives 

as a function of exposure time (10, 20, 30 and 40 min after the mortars were combed). 

 On the other hand, in terms of fresh state behavior, these mortars should present a 

slip value close to 0 mm. So, looking at the slip results, the fact that less water is needed 

when BA is introduced leads to lower slip values in BA50 and BA100 (0 to 1 mm) together 

with a good wetting capability along the exposure time after combed. 



Chapter 7 

 

131 
 

Figure 7.8 shows pictures of the tile surface covered by the mortars, used to estimate the 

transference capacity. This same figure was analyzed by image software, which enabled 

the quantification of the areas covered by the mortar. In figure 8 the area calculation was 

made on the basis of the total area of each tile (25 cm2). What is observed is a steady 

decreasing in the transference capacity of the mortar with open time. REF presents very 

high loss of transference capacity at 30 and 40 minutes of the test (in order of 46 and 85% 

of loss respectively). However, BA25, BA50 and BA100 showed values even higher than 

70% transference capacity after 40 minutes of the open time test. The loss of transference 

capability of the material 20 minutes after the application could have serious implications 

in the TAS, or as longer is the exposure time of the mortar, the lower is the adhesion of the 

ceramic piece to the mortar.

tiles (Considering 25 cm2 of total area per each ceramic tile). 



Chapter 7 

 

132 
 

 What could justify the difference between the reference mortar (REF) and other 

formulations containing BA is the fact that its surface presents a roughness and an overall 

number of smaller particles compared to S2, which may have promoted a better 

distribution of the cement paste in the aggregate particles surface increasing the interfacial 

contact between mortar and ceramic tile. 

Table 7. 5. Slip of cementitious-adhesive mortars.

 

Hardened state properties 

The tensile adhesion strength of samples cured in distinct conditions (standard, wet 

and heat) is given in table 6. The increase of adhesion with the incorporation of BA may be 

justified by two factors: (i) the increase of interfacial contact between the adhesive and the 

ceramic tile; (ii) the slight lower water content of BA-containing samples (water/cement 

ratio is 0.55 while the one of REF is 0.56). 

Upon curing in standard conditions (28d, 23ºC, 50%RH) we can observe that adhesion 

tensile strength proportionally increases with BA content, despite some uncertainty on the 

evolution given by the expressive standard deviation of measurements of REF and BA50 

samples.  

The adhesive strength of the entire system is dominated by the properties of the tile-

mortar interface [Jenni et al., 2005]. According to Chew (1999) the reduction of the 

capillary water, especially in the region near the interface between the adhesive and the 

substrate, will cause the flocculation of polymer particles and the appearance of a 

continuous close-packed layer of these particles at the surface of cement gel-hydrates. With 

water withdrawal caused by cement hydration (accelerated upon curing at higher 

temperature), the closed-packed layer of polymer particles tends to coalesce into 

continuous films or membranes, that will efficiently bind the cement hydrated particles 

together and form a monolithic network in which the polymer phase interpenetrates 

throughout the cement hydrate phase [Öhama et al., 1986]. Table 7.6 also presents the 

tensile adhesion strength of samples cured in water for 21 days, after being 7 days placed 

under the same standard conditions (23° C, 50% RH). The immersion in water strongly

diminishes the adhesion of samples. The results obtained show that BA formulations 

presented a slightly increase of TAS in immersion conditions when compared to REF. 

Developed studies [Jenni et al., 2006] focused in changes in physical properties of 

immersed adhesive-mortars, revealed that the strength decrease is attributed to causes 

related not only to cement hydration but also to volume changes of mortar and reversible 

swelling of latex films. These authors proved that in water the cellulose ether structures are 

completely dissolved. Furthermore, the adhesion strength of adhesive-mortars containing 

polymers is mainly dependent on the polymer content but it is less affected by the cement 

content or the water-cement ratio. Indeed, according to Schulze (1999) the adhesion 

strength can be increased with high levels of cement but the influence of the polymer is 

still much higher. 

Table 7. 6. Cementitious-adhesive adhesion strength results (MPa). 

 

 In opposition to the behaviour observed in water (wet cure condition), samples tend 

to gain adhesion when submitted to heat curing. This gain is not very significant but there 

is, under this curing condition, a positive trend in tensile adhesion strength as it was also 

observed by Jenni et al (2006), under prolonged storage of samples at 70 ºC and even at 

100 ºC. On the other hand, the evaluation of bond strength should always take into account 

not only the adhesive strength values but also the type of rupture (failure patterns), in order 

to effectively understand the behaviour of adhesive mortars.  

Samples cured for 7 and 14 days in standard conditions showed predominantly AF-T 

rupture (adhesive failure in the ceramic tile). However, upon prolonging the cure for 28 

days in standard conditions it was found that samples BA50 and BA100 revealed partial 

adhesive failure pattern [BA50 (35% AF-T and 65% CF-A), BA100 (60% AF-T and 40% 

CF-A)], while REF and BA25 ones only show AF-T rupture. This change is related to the 

observed increase on the values of tensile adhesion strength in both higher BA content 

formulations, cured in this condition.  

Differences between failure patterns of samples cured in water and under heat can 

be observed in figure 7.9. AF-T is dominant in wet conditions while CF-A is more

common on samples cured under heat. According to Jenni et al (2006), the resulting failure 

patterns can be correlated to the final adhesive strength achieved by the tile adhesive-

mortar, leading to an interface failure pattern in wet conditions or a failure trough the 

adhesive mortar (cohesive failure pattern) under heat curing conditions.  

 
Figure 7. 9. Examples of cementitious-adhesives failure patterns commonly observed in the 

actual study (left image – AF-T observed on samples cured in water; right image – CF-A 
observed on samples cured under heat). 

 

Figure 7.10 shows the relation between the adhesion strength (after 28 days of 

curing in standard conditions under 30 minutes of open time) of the samples and 

transference capacity results after 30 minutes of open time. Bentz et al (2008) emphasizes 

that tackiness is lost due to the formation of a skin/film and reinforce the idea that a key 

property of adhesive-mortars is their open time. TAS increase with BA content increasing 

on open time test (30’). It means that there is a higher adhesive capability of the adhesive 

mortar that can be also related to their wetting capability and transference capacity (figures 

7.7 and 7.8). Formulations with BA present transference and wetting capability higher than 

REF not only at 30 minutes, but also at 10, 20 and 40 minutes of open time. This fact could 

justify the highest value of TAS obtained for this formulation in the open time test. The 

addition of BA retards the adhesive film formation leading to an increasing of workability 

time of the product; BA also promotes an increase in the interfacial contact between 

adhesive and tile, consequently increasing the tensile adhesion strength of formulations 

with BA in their composition.

7.4  Conclusions 

1) BA landfilling classification 

The bottom ash from the studied bubbling fluidized bed combustor using residual forest 

biomass as fuel is considered a non-hazardous material according to legal limits established 

in Decision 2003/33/CE and the Portuguese Decree-Law 152/2002.  

2) BA as a replacement aggregate in CAM formulations 

About the fresh properties of the formulations tested, the replacement of coarse sand by 

BA led to a decrease on water demand by formulations, and the results in fresh state 

showed that adhesive-mortars could keep interesting values of wetting capability, even 

with lower water content. Increasing on the replacement amount of conventional sand by 

BA proportionally increases the tensile adhesion strength of the formulations in every 

storage conditions (standard wet and heat curing). This result could be mainly related with 

the increase of interfacial contact between the adhesive and the ceramic tile. The developed 

tests of wetting capability and transference demonstrate that the conventional sand (S2) 

replacement by BA lead to a considerable increasing in both parameters. 

About the hardened properties of the formulations tested, the evaluation of adhesion 

also involved the follow up of the failure adhesion patterns. Introduction of BA led to a 

shift from typical adhesive failure pattern in the tile-adhesive interface to a cohesive failure 

pattern inside the mortar. This effect can be attributed to the increase on tensile adhesion 

strength of the adhesive mortar containing BA. Another advantage in incorporating BA in 

these mortars was observed in the open time test that gives indication on the tackiness of

the adhesive mortars. BA contributes to delay the adhesive film formation, thus leading to 

better adhesion results. 

Particle size distribution of BA could be properly adjusted to replace the 

conventional coarse sand aggregates used in this type of cementitious adhesive-mortar 

formulations. Hence, recycling of BA in adhesive mortar was found to be suitable for this 

kind of application without detrimental implications in terms of major chemical or physical 

effects on the product. It was shown that this process constitutes a valid waste valorization 

solution in a construction material, also reducing the use of an important natural resource 

(raw coarse sand) which, in turn, contributes to increase the level of sustainability of the 

industrial processes involved. Furthermore, this waste recycling solution is also important 

for the pulp and paper industry and energy industry, because it contributes to avoid the 

landfill disposal of one of its industrial process residues (the bottom ash from biomass 

combustion), thus minimizing related environmental and economic costs.

Abstract 

Bottom bed waste (BBW) from combustion of forest biomass residues was characterized 

aiming its use as partial substitute of fresh bed sand (FBS) in industrial bubbling fluidized 

bed combustors (BFBC). BBW particle size distribution, elemental composition (mainly 

Si, Ca, Al, Na, K, P and Mg) and mineralogy were evaluated considering also the influence 

of the characteristics of the biomass used as fuel. Biomass combustion experiments were 

developed using a pilot-scale bubbling fluidized bed combustor. The operating conditions 

during the experiments were monitored, namely the flue gas composition (CO2, O2 and 

CO), temperature and pressure, and compared with data collected from BFBC located in 

two industrial biomass thermal power plants. Physical, chemical and mineralogical 

characteristics of the FBS and BBW revealed that practices related with biomass handling 

at the forest strongly influence the BBW properties, not only in terms of coarse soil 

particles addition (&gt; 1.0 mm) but also mineralogically. However, the results obtained here 

indicate that by sieving of BBW it is possible to recover almost 60% of the original BBW 

particles (size between 0.3 to 1.0 mm), which have properties that allow its reuse as 

substitute of FBS for bed make-up in industrial BFBC.

8.1  Introduction 

 Fluidized bed combustion (FBC) is recognized as the most suitable technology for 

biomass combustion. FBC plants can deal with distinct fuel mixtures (e.g. different types 

of biomass) but might show some operating problems when the particle size distribution 

and type/amount of impurities in the fuel are not adjusted (Mitsui, 1997). The combustion 

temperature inside the bed must be kept relatively low (usually 700–900°C) in order to 

prevent ash sintering. Even so, this technology assures high conversion efficiency 

[(McKendry, 2002; Khan et al., 2009]. Problems that might appear during biomass 

combustion are related to the amount of ashes being generated and their properties, with 

potential reflex on the energy conversion efficiency. Slagging, fouling, corrosion, and bed 

agglomeration are unwanted episodes. Additionally, the generated ash also requires a 

proper environmental [Werkelin et al., 2010; Rajamma et al., 2009]. 

Several authors consider agglomeration of bed particles as the major problem during 

biomass combustion in FBC [Ohman et al., 2005; Zevenhoven-Onderwater et al., 2006; 

Elled et al., 2013; Nuutinen et al., 2004]. According to Bartels et al. (2008) the 

inappropriate fluidization caused by agglomeration could lead to the fluidized bed collapse. 

The bed material agglomeration and sintering are related with the sticky coatings on bed 

particles formation. These coatings are formed by multiple layers of ash or ash-rich 

compounds. The internal layers seem to be a sign of the composition of the bed material 

(sand), while the outer layers are essentially defined by the ash characteristics [Ohman et 

al., 2000]. In addition, certain elements segregation to the ash layers on bed sand particles 

has been observed [Åmand and Leckner, 2004]. The volume of ashes, their characteristics 

and management has been considered one of the most important issues during 

thermochemical conversion of biomass to energy. The type of biomass in use (i.e., forest 

wastes, wood, herbaceous, domestic wastes), the amount/nature of impurities (i.e., soil, 

inorganics), the technology and the operating conditions (e.g., bed material residence time, 

temperature, etc.) determine the amount and characteristics of the ashes produced during 

combustion. According to Vassilev et al. (2012) approximately 480 million ton. of ash 

from biomass combustion could be generated worldwide annually. This quantity is 

becoming comparable to that of coal ash, namely 780 million ton produced per year at 

present [Izquierdo and Querol, 2012]. 



Chapter 8

 During biomass combustion in bubbling fluidized bed combustors (BFBC) two 

main types of ashes are produced: bottom bed and fly ashes. The bottom bed ashes are 

basically composed by a mixture of sand (mainly quartz) particles from the original bed, 

and by inert/inorganic components (forest soil and small stones) included in the biomass. 

Additionally unburnt organic components might also be present in the ash. The 

components of the fly ashes are similar to the previous ones, but finer enough to be aspired 

by the exhaustion system of the combustor. The bed sand fraction is normally much lower 

than in the bottom ash, since only the original finer particles or the ones resulting from 

attrition and abrasion phenomena are present. During BFBC, the bottom bed ashes often 

represent the lower fraction of the total ashes produced: around 5 %wt. [Latva-Somppi et 

al., 1998a; Latva-Somppi et al., 1998b], 10 %wt. [Dahl et al., 2010], and 17 %wt. [Tarelho 

et al., 2012]. However, in some Portuguese thermal plants with BFBC, the relative amount 

of bottom bed ashes can be as high as 50-60 %wt. [Tarelho et al., 2012]. 

 The bottom bed waste is generated when periodic discharges of the bed are 

performed: i) trying to maintain the particle size distribution and to avoid agglomeration, in 

order to assure the suitable fluidity and hydrodynamic conditions of the bubbling bed; ii) to 

discharge the excess of solids (ash) and keep the height constant. In general, the relative 

high level of inert material present in the biomass used in Portuguese BFBC plants 

(Tarelho et al., 2011) enhances the frequency of bed discharges, meaning that bottom bed 

ashes have low residence time (&lt;5 days - see Tables 8.1 and 8.2) in the BFBC when 

compared with results reported for other installations using BFBC [Latva-Somppi et al., 

1998a; Latva-Somppi et al., 1998b]. Since around 60 wt.% of discharged bottom bed waste 

is composed by sand particles having sizes in the range of 0.5 – 1.0 mm, the mentioned 

increase of discharge frequency will imply a stronger make-up with fresh sand, while 

increases the volume of waste being generated. 

 The bottom bed waste from BFBC have the code 100124 according to European 

List of Wastes [Decree n.º 209/2004] and the search for recycling or reuse alternatives of 

such residue is an hot topic and a serious need. We should also look to other relevant 

environmental indications like the one given by Hoffman (2013) that concluded that 

around 90% of the beaches in the world are losing ground due to excessive sand extraction 

for distinct uses.

 Previous studies demonstrated that the use of bottom bed waste from biomass 

burning in BFBC as substitute of the conventional sand used as coarse aggregate in the 

formulation of industrially-prepared rendering-mortars is technologically feasible [Modolo 

et al., 2013]; in general this substitution does not induce negative effects on the relevant 

properties and material accomplishes with required specifications. However, other 

applications for such waste must be found and one obvious option is the recirculation or 

reuse of the material in the same BFBC. Apparently easy, this way requires the pre-

adjustment of particle size distribution, with removal of fines and agglomerates by 

screening. This pre-treatment might also help to minimize the concentration of inorganic 

alkali elements that tend to constitute the agglomerates. Nevertheless, other chemical 

impurities might not be removed by this simple process, and additional leaching/washing 

processes might be required to reach the purity level of the bed make-up. 

 The main aim of the actual work is improving the knowledge on the characteristics 

of bottom bed waste from fluidized bed combustion of residual forest biomass in 

Portuguese thermal plants and cogeneration plants. Based on them, physical pre-treatment 

processes were applied aiming to regenerate the material to be recirculated in the bed of a 

pilot-scale combustor. 

8.2  Materials and methods 

8.2.1 Characterization of industrial bottom bed waste 

 The sampling schematic diagram of the ashes here studied is shown in Figure 8.1. 

The bottom bed waste (BBW) studied were sampled in two BFBC, with nominal capacities 

of 50 MWh and 100 MWth, denominated TPP_1 and TPP_2 respectively. They both use a 

mixture of forest biomass residues as fuel. In each installation, the typical operating 

temperature of the bubbling bed ranges from 750ºC to 940ºC; while the O2 concentration in 

the flue gas varies between 4 vol.% and 8 vol.% (dry gases). Bottom bed wastes from 

TPP_1 (BBW_1) and from TPP_2 (BBW_2) were collected and characterized 

simultaneously during one year (monthly).The particle size distributions of the fresh bed 

sand (FBS) and of bottom bed wastes were obtained by sieving, following the NP EN 933-

1:2000 standard. For this determination, the waste was collected from the BFBC and used 

as discharged. Further characterization tests were performed with sieved fraction below 2 

mm. The chemical composition was obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF),

using a Panalytical Axios spectrometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the wastes 

were taken using an X-ray diffractometer (RIGAKU-Geigerflex, power 40kV/30mA) and 

the semi-quantitative analysis determined by MDI Jade9 software using WPF (Whole 

Pattern Fitting) method, in the scan mode continuous/speed-3 2??/min. Simultaneous 

gravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TG/DTA – Setaram, Labsys) were used to 

complement the chemical characterization, namely to detect unburnt organic components.

respective samples used in this study. 

8.2.2 Use of recycled bed waste (RBW) as sand bed replacement in BFBC 

 From a third TPP with nominal capacity of 90MWth, which operates in similar 

conditions of TPP_1 and TPP_2, in terms of temperature and pressure, but using 

eucalyptus bark as major fuel, another BBW sample (~50kg) was collected and sieved, 

having particles ranging from 0.3 mm and 1.0 mm. This sample is here named recycled bed 

waste (RBW) since it was reused as fluidized bed in a pilot-scale combustor. The 

combustion experiments were performed in a pilot-scale bubbling fluidized bed (0.2 m 

height); the reactor is a thermally insulated AISI 310 SS tube with 0.25 m internal diameter 

and 3 m height. The facility layout is shown in Figure 2 and is better described elsewhere

[Tarelho et al., 2011; Tarelho et al., 2004; Tarelho et al., 2005). The combustion air is 

staged with primary air during the distributor plate whereas secondary air goes into a 

vertical tube located inside the freeboard. The solid fuel is fed together the secondary air 

and discharged constantly at the bed surface (Figure 8.2). Eight water-cooled probes are 

located at the bed level. They allow the bed temperature control between the desired 

ranges. Pressure and temperature along the reactor are supervised by means of nine water-

cooled sampling probes located at several heights; two are immersed in the dense bed and 

the others are situated along the freeboard. Each probe is equipped with a cooled particle 

filter at the stern of the probe, a K-type thermocouple, and a cerablanket (ceramic fiber 

refractory) cap at the tip located inside the combustion chamber with the purpose of 

holding the particles present in the flue gas. The combustion flue gas composition was 

monitored continuously at the exit of the combustion chamber in terms of O2, CO and CO2; 

the online gas analyzers included a paramagnetic sensor for O2 (ADC model 02-700 with a 

Servomex Module) and non-dispersive infra-red sensors for CO2 and CO (ADC model SB-

300). Residual forest biomass from eucalyptus logging activities was used as fuel; it was 

air dried, chopped and sieved to the size range of 1-5 mm. The main thermochemical 

characteristics of the biomass used as fuel are shown in Table 8.1. The pilot-scale BFBC 

operated with a bed temperature in the range of 790-840 ºC, and with an excess air of 50%. 

The fuel was continuously fed to the reactor at a rate of approximately 3.8 kg/h. The 

combustion air was staged, with primary air accounting for 80% of the total combustion 

air. The combustion experiments lasted approximately 10 hours. After that, the bottom bed 

ash was discharged/quenched and conditioned for further characterization.

 That characterization involved scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S2300 SEM 

with EDX25KV) analyses performed to evaluate the morphology and elemental 

composition of bed ash particles collected. Samples of forest biomass residues used as fuel 

in the industrial thermal power plants were collected in the fuel feeding system of the 

plants in order to characterize the impurities (forest soil and stones) fed mixed. Those 

impurities were separated from branches, grounded in agate mill (&lt;0.100 mm) and 

characterized in terms of chemical composition and mineralogy. 

8.3 Results and Discussion  

8.3.1 Industrial bottom bed waste 

 Figure 8.3 illustrates the macroscopic view of the fresh bed sand particles “a”, and 

particles of the two wastes (BBW_1 “b” and BBW_2 “c”). Color differences are very 

notorious between the two wastes, reflecting the type of biomass used as fuel (TPP_1 burns 

a large variety of residual forest biomass residues, whereas TPP_2 uses mainly eucalyptus 

bark), and the presence of unburnt material (that tend to assume dark hue). In both 

residues, the presence of coarse particles is evident, reflecting the presence of inorganic 

impurities (forest soil particles, coarse and small stones) fed mixed with the biomass fuel. 

The macroscopic view of these impurities is shown in Figure 8.4 “a” and their 

mineralogical and chemical composition in Figure 8.4 “b” and “c” respectively. The 

presence of this type of impurities fed mixed in biomass evidences bad practices applied 

during biomass handling at forest before delivering to the BFBC installations. In terms of 

mineralogy, quartz and kaolinite are the most abundant crystalline phases present in this 

material, followed by common mica (muscovite) and feldspars (microcline and albite). 

Consequently, Si, Al and K are the most abundant chemical elements present in these 

impurities, as detected in the chemical analysis (Figure 8.4 “c”). 

 Figures 8.5 and 3.6 show the particle size distributions of FBS and BBW. The 

wastes have wide particle size distributions when compared to the FSB, being the presence 

of fines (particles under 0.25 mm) relatively more abundant than the amount of coarse 

grains (&gt; 1 mm). This is an indication that agglomeration is not too severe in the actual 

burning conditions, being the fines introduced as impurities in the fuel feed or resulting 

from the breakdown of larger particles of the sand bed. Dimensional changes between 

samples collected in consecutive months are broader in BBW_2, reflecting less stable

operating conditions in the TPP_2. Nevertheless, the fraction of particles within the 

desirable size range (0.3-1 mm) is rather similar in the two wastes, representing around 60 

wt.% of the material.

Figure 8.7 and Figure 8.8 show the chemical compositions of the wastes and FSB, 

while their semi-quantitative mineralogical constitution is given in Figure 8.9. In general, 

changes on the composition of BBW collected in consecutive months are not expressive, 

apart some punctual fluctuations in minor elements (e.g. Cl, S, Ti). Anyway, BBW_1 

seems to show higher variability, certainly related with stronger changes is the fuel feed, as 

previously mentioned. Both BBW samples show Si as major element (between 35 and 40 

%wt.), being mostly present as quartz. FBS is even richer in Si, because is mainly 

composed by quartz sand, as can be seen in Figure 8.10 and also as will be showed by

SEM-EDX analyses. Contributing to the high Si content in the BBW samples is the 

original fresh bed sand, and also the forest soil particles fed mixed with the residual forest 

biomass resulting from bad practices during biomass harvesting and handling previously to 

combustion in the industrial BFBC installations, as also referred in other studies [Steenari 

et al., 1999]; the impurities (forest soil particles) fed mixed with the residual forest biomass 

also contribute to the Al and K content (present in the microcline and albite mineral 

composition). Calcium (and magnesium) tend to react with Si or to generate carbonates, 

while these last components might also be present since the beginning as contaminant of 

the sand or in the biomass. Those additional elements/phases detected in the wastes were 

certainly introduced by the inorganic impurities present in the biomass (Figure 8.4), as 

reported in the literature [Åmand and Leckner, 2004; Aho et al., 2008; Dayton et al., 1999]. 

While few and small, mullite peaks seem also to be present, certainly as a result of 

reactions that occurred at high temperature. Loss on ignition is below 2% in all BBW 

samples, but changes along the time are relatively high, particularly for BBW_2. This is 

another indication of higher operational fluctuations on the TPP_2 unit.

 Thermal analyses (TG/DTA) are shown in Figure 8.11 and confirm the overall inert 

characteristics of BBW samples. The most noticeable weight loss was registered between 

600 and 800 ºC and results from the release of CO2 of the carbonates (mainly calcite). This 

reaction is also denoted by the endothermic peak registered in the DTA curve at about 750 

°C. The other endothermic reaction, detected at 573 °C, is attributed to the ?-? quartz 

polymorphic transformation. The total mass loss reached about 4%, above the LOI values

8.3.2  Use of recycled bed waste (RBW) as sand bed replacement in BFBC 

 As observed in previous sections, during biomass combustion, the original sand bed 

particles become enriched in chemical compounds that correspond to the inorganic 

contaminants in the biomass. This enrichment occurs as a coating layer of the sand 

particles. This process is shown in Figure 8.12 and Figure 8.13, where the SEM-EDS of the 

cross-section of a particle from the fresh sand bed (FSB) and a particle from the RBW are 

presented. In these figures, we also show the distribution and qualitative abundance of 

some of those chemical elements, namely Ca, K, Mg, Al, P, and Na. The increasing of such 

elements in the outer layer of the bottom bed particles has been documented in the 

literature and appears to establish the particle agglomeration [Zevenhoven-Onderwater et 

al., 2006; Nuutinen et al., 2004; Ohman and Nordin, 2000; Lin et al., 2003; Lin and Wey, 

2004; Scala and Chirone, 2006]. At the same time as expressive upon operation, this

phenomenon is unwanted, since it will modify the fluidizing conditions through the bed 

[Ohman et al., 2000; Ohman, A. Nordin, 2000; Lyn and Wey, 2004; Kuo et al., 2008; Lin 

et al., 2009; Skrifvars et al., 1998; Zevenhoven-Onderwater et al., 2001]. Attempting to 

prevent its occurrence, some authors suggested the use of certain additives [Bartels et al., 

2008; Ohman and Nordin, 2000; Kuo et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2009; Llorente et al., 2006]. 

According to Lin et al. (2009) the coating layer formed around the particles is composed by 

infusible fine waste particles embedded in the melted phases. These authors concluded that 

melts contain potassium, sodium, and sulfur, while the infusible components are rich in 

calcium and magnesium. Based on SEM-EDS determinations, distinct authors [Nuutinen et 

al., 2004; Ohman et al., 2000] demonstrate that the coating layer of sand particles is rich in 

alkali and Si. The melting point of certain silicates can be as low as 720ºC, being the 

reaction also affected by the particle size. Tendency for agglomeration is proportional to 

the specific surface area of the particles [Langston and Stephens, 1960], so the relative 

amount of finer grains should be limited. Combustion experiments conducted with RBW 

lasted for 6-7 hours (constant period of data registration).  

 
Figure 8. 12. Scanning electronic microscopic (SEM) view of cross section of Fresh bed sand 

(FBS) particles and EDS images. 

 Average values for the pressure and temperature profiles along the reactor height 

are shown in Figure 8.14. The pressure is higher at the base of the bed (109 kPa), tends to 

decrease along the bubbling fluidized bed height, and stabilizes along the freeboard height 

(107 kPa). The temperature has a minimum value (around 380ºC) at the base of the bed 

(measured below the level of the fluidizing air injectors, that is, in the fixed bed region), 

then it increases in the fluidized bed section and achieves its maximum (960ºC) just above 

the place where fuel feeding and secondary air ingress occurs.

a significant amount of volatile matter (typically higher than 75 %wt in dry basis) and it is 

recognized that the release and combustion of this volatile matter occurs mostly near the 

location where the fuel is feeding [Tarelho et al., 2011]. After that, the temperature 

decreases along the freeboard due to heat losses through furnace walls (Figure 8.2). 

 The operating temperature is an important parameter to be controlled in order to 

guarantee an efficient fuel conversion, and also to control the bed fluidization conditions. 

Figure 8.15 shows typical flue gas composition profile measured during the experiment; 

CO2, O2, and CO average concentrations (by %vol. of dry gases) were around 13%, 8% 

and 0.005%, respectively. 

 During the pilot-scale combustion experiment no expressive particle agglomeration 

was observed, and so no changes on the bed fluidizing conditions were registered. The 

waste discharged from the pilot-scale BFBC, thereafter denoted as recycled bottom bed 

waste (RBBW), looked just slightly darker than the used RBW.  

 Nevertheless it was observed the occurrence of some sand particles linked, 

corresponding to less than 0.1% of bed mass [value founded through the sieving (retained 

mass in 1.00 mm) of bottom bed waste total mass]. Industrially, this 0.1% can represent 

around 50kg of agglomerates total mass, considering a bed capacity of 50 tones.

agglomerate from RBBW, and respective EDS results of the particle surface (pointed section); and 
(c)  Scanning electronic microscopic (SEM) image of the connecting bridge between particles of

 Figure 8.16 “a” illustrates small agglomerated bed particles from the pilot-scale 

combustion experiments. It is observed that some particles are linked by a kind of 

connective bridge with distinct texture when compared to the surrounding particles. 

According to many developed studies already referred, this phenomenon is related with the 

occurrence of melting in the outer layer of the sand particles, and associated with the 

relative content of some chemical elements (mainly sodium, potassium) present in this ash

layer [Bartels et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2009; Langston and Stephens, 1960; 

Manzoori and Agarwal, 1994]. 

Figure 8.16 “b” shows a detail (determined by SEM-EDS analysis) of a particle 

surface and connection layer between particles from 8.16 “a”. From Figure 8.16 “b” it is 

observed that the main elements present in the particle surface (measured at 2.4 and 8.7 µ m 

depths) are Ca, Si, Mg, Al, P, Cl, Mn and Fe. The EDS from the particle surface at 2.4 µ m 

depth indicate mainly the presence of Ca, Si and Mg. With increasing depth in the particle 

surface, e.g. at 8.7 µ m (also in the typical outer ash layer of the bed particles (Figure 8.12), 

it is observed an increasing intensity in the abundance of Mg and K. In fact, it is reported in 

the literature, a characteristic dual ash layer around the bed particles that consists of an 

inner layer rich in potassium (typically potassium silicate) and an outer layer rich in 

calcium where calcium silicate is dominant [Ohman et al., 2005; Elled et al., 2013; 

Nuutinen et al., 2004]. In this case, calcium is dominant in both depths. 

8.3.3 Economic evaluation of the recirculation scenario 

 Figure 8.16 “c” shows the detail (determined by SEM/EDS analysis) of the 

connection bridge formed between two adjacent sand particles. It is confirmed the 

enrichment in sodium, potassium and silicon, and the relative decrease in calcium, in the 

bridge connecting the two bed particles when compared with the particle surface EDS 

(Figure 8.16 “b”). This chemical composition explains the lowering on the melting 

temperature of the ash layer around the sand particles and the consequent connection 

bridge formation between adjacent particles, as has been reported in the literature [Lin et 

al., 2003; Zevenhoven-Onderwater et al., 2001]. The interaction between alkali metals and 

oxygen can result in the formation of oxide-eutectics with a low melting point, for example 

Na2O, causing particle agglomeration [Lin et al., 2009; Atakül et al., 2005]. Also, the 

importance of potassium in this process is recognized, e.g., Elled et al. (2013) found 

potassium silicate (K2SiO9) in the inner ash layer and using a thermodynamic equilibrium 

modeling approach suggested that it can originate a melt at typical temperatures of 

fluidized bed combustion. They suggest that this melted form of K2SiO9, which can also be 

present as K2O.4SiO2 probably leads to a sticky coating of the quartz sand particles which 

induce agglomeration if this inner ash layer is not covered by non-sticky as particles 

consisting of calcium silicate. 



Chapter 8 

156 
 

 Nevertheless, it should probably be noted that these problems of agglomeration 

may become minimized considering, in addition to the physical treatment, a chemical 

treatment of recycled bottom bed waste through an efficient washing system in order to 

decrease part of the alkali and soluble salts concentration [Tarelho et al., 2012; Modolo et 

al., 2013], thus decreasing the risk of bed particles agglomeration. However, in that 

circumstance it will be needed to consider proper management options for the washing 

solution. 

 Table 8.3 presents real inputs and outputs of biomass fuel, fresh sand bed, bottom 

bed waste and fly ash mass flows for the two thermal power plants (TPP_1 and TPP_2). In 

general, inputs are similar for the two power plants, but significant differences exist in the 

relative amount of produced bottom bed waste and fly ash; TPP_1 generates higher amount 

of BBW (~ 6900 ton) when compared to TPP_2 (5819 ton). 

 Estimated values were also obtained (see Table 8.3), based on experimental data 

collected in field, and on bench and pilot-scale trials. In this analysis, we approached the 

decreasing of mass flow sent to landfill while saving costs associated with partial 

replacement of fresh sand for bed make-up were anticipated (Table 8.2). The fresh sand 

used in these BFBCs has particle sizes comprehended in the range of 0.3-1.0 mm. As it has 

been shown, BBW contains ~60% particles within that size range. 

Table 8. 2. Thermal power plants mass flows of biomass fuel, FBS, BBW and FA quantities and 
associated costs. 

 

If no material valorization is considered, a total of 12719 ton of BBW is landfilled, 

with an associated cost of around 400.000,00 €/year [the landfill cost is estimated and

this value the costs associated with acquisition of fresh sand to make-up the bed (FSB) 

(approximately 65.000,00 €/year), the total costs approach half million €/year. On the other 

hand, by assuming 60 wt% reuse of BBW as bed make-up, predicted savings are over 

200.000,00 €/year (X in Table 8.3). This estimation does not consider potential costs 

associated with physical BBW treatment operations, since in the actual circumstances the 

screening facilities already exist in the industrial unit and then no additional investment 

costs are required for its acquisition.

8.4  Conclusions 

 Some conclusions based on the present work about the use of a fraction of sand 

particles from the bottom bed ash discharged from fluidized bed combustion of biomass 

can be made:

the sand used as original bed in the BFBC, and other components that came from biomass 

contaminants (forest soil particles) and inorganic content of biomass (ash). 

2 - The characterization of the BBW from two different biomass thermal power plants not 

only demonstrated the influence of the inorganic content of the biomass in the BBW 

chemical and mineralogical properties when compared with the original sand bed, but also 

emphasized the strong influence of the original bed sand in those properties, mainly in 

terms of quartz amount. 

3 - Combustion experiments in a pilot-scale BFBC proved the potential of using RBBA as 

raw material in substitution of fresh sand for bed make-up in BFBC. 

4 - Cost-benefit analysis could help to enlight the industry about the importance of using a 

fraction of the sand present in this waste as raw material, leading not only to the decrease 

of costs related with landfilling, but also saving costs with raw fresh bed sand acquisition, 

both important for the efficient use of resources.

9.1  Wastes amounts and tested solutions  

This chapter exemplifies and discusses some important aspects related to the 

valorization solutions tested mainly in terms of wastes generated amount, conventional 

raw-materials consumption, industrial process operations viability and limitations. The 

amount of wastes generated is referred to a ton of processed pulp. Table 9.1 presents the 

amount of some solid wastes generated in the pulp mill during 2012 year based on 330 

working days in Portugal. Fly ash from biomass combustion was not studied in this thesis 

work, but its generated amount is also presented.

shown on table 9.1. This estimative and respective recycling capacity is presented in Figure 

9.1 and discussed in the section 9.2. 

 Considering the developed study-cases in this thesis, it was possible to summarize 

the solutions discussed in section 9.2 for the waste material valorization. 

9.2  Material valorization solutions 

9.2.1  Fiber-cement (Chapter 3) 

 Virgin long fiber pulp (VLFP) represents 2.6% of total fiber-cement composition in 

proportion of dry raw materials. Conventionally the used fiber in fiber-cement production 

is from softwood (Pinus). In this work, these softwood long fibers were replaced by 

hardwood fibers existing in the primary sludge (PS) that is generated in pulp and paper mill 

effluent treatment; the fixed replacement level studied was 25%. The primary sludge 

composition includes around ~70% hardwood fibers and fillers (~5% sand and 25% 

precipitated calcium carbonate), as already referred on chapter 3. Figure 9.1 presents the 

absorption/consuming flow of the fiber-cement application. 

It is important to consider the following aspects related not only with the waste 

characteristics but also with the process itself: 

• Sludge transportation and storage 

The specific characteristics of PS, namely its high moisture content and odour, lead to 

special care in terms of transportation and storage. First, PS needs to be transported in big 

bags which will facilitate its weight measurement before being introduced into refinement 

tank for beating. After, these big bags can easily be storage in a place where they don’t 

disturb workers due to its unpleasant smell. It is also important to consider the storage time 

which will depend on the weather and storage conditions, trying to avoid PS decomposition 

and consequent loss of quality. 

• Energy - Sludge disintegration (beating process) 

The Eucalyptus fibers achieve the same Schopper Riegler degree consuming less energy 

comparing to Pinus fibers. Lower refinement time represents low energy consumption 

compared to the standard process containing only virgin pulp composed of long fibers. A 



Chapter 9 

163 
 

30% time saving was estimated during the industrial test procedure, consequently, leading 

to costs reduction. 

• Water quality control (total suspended solids and dissolved salts) 

The VLFP represents 2.6% of dry material in fiber-cement production. 25% of this amount 

can be substituted by primary sludge. Knowing that 40% of primary sludge is composed by 

inorganic material, the amount of suspended solids introduced by the sludge is estimated in 

26 kg per ton of dried fiber-cement produced. This solids might be retained on fiber-

cement sheets or drained to the process water together conventional solids. This fact can 

lead to two opposite aspects, a positive and a negative one. The positive aspect is related to 

the fiber-cement sheet density increase that was evaluated as appropriated in the final 

product specification. The negative one is related with the cumulative discharge of solid 

matter presented in the waste composition, in the water process. This fact might deserve 

more frequent monitorization of the water in order to avoid problems as vats obstruction 

and/or corrosion of equipment and consequently improvement of maintenance costs. 

General costs associated with this waste management solution were shown on Chapter 3. 

9.2.2  Bituminous mixtures (Chapter 4) 

 The amount of aggregates in a bituminous mixture represents between 90 to 95% in 

mass and 70 to 75% in volume [Pereira e Santos, 2002]. It was estimated that the amount 

of crushed limestone and filler (represents around 50%wt of 4%wt total aggregates, 

respectively) consumed per one kilometre of dense bituminous layer - with 6 cm of 

thickness (DBL) from a highway with 27 meters width. Assuming those figures, the 

amount of grits and dregs used as replacement of the primary components can be 

estimated. The substitution of 5%wt of crushed limestone by grits represents to save 10% 

of that conventional material extracted. The construction of at least 200 kilometres of DBL 

is necessary to incorporate all grits generated per year. In case of dregs, replacing 1% of 

the filler represents to avoid more than 25% of this conventional material extraction. 

 However, not only the saving of non-renewable materials extraction makes part of 

this recycling option and other aspects must be considered and researched in order to 

improve this solution, including both environment and industrial issues.  



Chapter 9 

164 
 

 For instance, two wastes characteristics, moisture and soluble salts content are 

examples of these aspects to be assessed. The need for drying is one of the most relevant 

issues, due to energy demand and cost. Dregs and grits have high moisture content (~50% 

and 40%, respectively) requiring proper pre-drying before composing the bituminous 

mixture. Additionally, dregs require a washing treatment to reduce the level of soluble 

salts. According to experimental indications given in chapter 5, a minimum of 10 tons of 

hot water (~80ºC) per ton of dregs is required to reach an acceptable level of soluble salts 

in their composition, allowing then their use in bituminous mixtures. In addition, the 

wastewater from the washing process should be properly treated before discharge in the 

environment, and this enhances costs. 

9.2.3  Industrial Mortars (Chapters 6 and 7) 

Two types of industrial mortars were analyzed in this work, namely renders and 

cementitious-adhesive formulations. In both products, the used of conventional calibrated 

sand was replaced by treated bottom ash generated in a bubbling fluidized bed combustor 

using forest residues as fuel. In general, these applications seemed to be technologically 

feasible. The substitution did not induce negative impact on the relevant properties and 

formulations accomplish with the industry required specifications. However, the waste 

treatment (sieving to remove coarse and fine particles and/or washing to diminish soluble 

salts content) before utilization seems to be needed in order to guarantee the success of this 

solution. 

Figure 9.2 presents the estimation of the amounts of bottom ash with interest for this 

specific application in terms of conventional sand replacement, bottom ash generated 

amount and bottom ash surplus; it is also shown the amount of conventional sand 

consumed. According to the results presented and discussed in detail on chapters 6 and 7 it 

is possible to replace over 50%wt of conventional calibrated sand by a fraction of bottom 

ash without compromising the final products quality. In order to improve this waste 

management solution, it is important to consider aspects related with the waste 

characteristics and to the process itself. 

 According to industry data (value supplied by one factory) at least 24000 tonnes of 

calibrated sand has been consumed every year. They are generated around 28750 tonnes of 

raw bottom ash per year in which 60% (~17250t) is useful for being utilized as aggregate 



Chapter 9 

165 
 

in these types of mortars. For example, if consider 25% (value tested in bench scale) of 

conventional calibrated sand replacement by treated (just sieved) bottom ash, it has been 

verified that at least 6000 tonnes of this waste (fractions between 0.3 – 1.00 mm) would be 

valorized (Figure 9.2). The treated bottom ash surplus (~11250t) could be used in other 

applications i.e. its reuse in as raw material as substitute of fresh sand for bottom bed make 

up in fluidized bed combustors where it is generated (see Chapter 8).

mortars, conventional sand consumption and bottom ash surplus. 
  

9.3 Concluding remarks 

The involved partners will have to be aware about the advantages and concerns 

related with the above referred processes of waste valorization. In case of the waste 

producer, by avoiding landfilling it contributes to environment protection; and also 

economic costs related with to this waste management option are saved. Part of the savings 

related to the avoiding of waste landfilling can be used by the waste producer to transport 

and deliver the waste to the unit where its pre-treatment will be performed. In case of the 

unit that treats the waste to sell or to valorize it, if he receives the waste on its location, the 

economic benefits are higher considering that he gets an additional product to be treated 

and commercialized without raw material acquisition. However, the need for investment 

will depend on the industrial unit where the waste will be treated, as for, place to storage 

the waste, the need for specific sieving, liquid effluent treatment and monitoring and this 

will influence the costs of the recycling operation. At least, the benefit in terms of 



Chapter 9 

166 
 

decreased costs related to conventional sand acquisition will avoid the extraction of the 

natural resource thus contributing to environmental protection, and sustainability of 

process.  

The success of those recycling solutions will depend on how the intervenient have 

capacity to integrate the operations and to minimize the related costs with the whole 

process.  



 

 

 

10 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS



Chapter 10 

168 
 

10.1 Conclusions 

The design of correct waste management plans could avoid the landfilling of 

several by-products/wastes and, if recycling alternatives are searched, the consumption of 

primary non-renewable resources will diminish. Impacts associated to their extraction and 

treatment will be avoided. However, to fully accomplish with environmental and technical 

aspects of each recycling solution, multidisciplinary issues must be considered. 

Novel recycling alternatives for several wastes generated by the pulp and paper 

industries were defined in this work, as is summarized in this chapter. 

 

 Fiber-cement composites can be produced with 25% of primary sludge in 

substitution of conventional cellulose long fibers without affecting the required properties 

of the material or the productive process. The controlled parameters of the processing 

water, such as COD, chlorides, sulphates, dissolved salts and metals of process water are 

acceptable when compared with the conventional process. The mechanical and physical 

properties of the sludge-containing composites were improved. Fiber-cement sheets with 

primary sludge achieved a bending moment higher than conventional ones (5267 N and 

4695 N, respectively) and a load at rupture was also higher and acceptable according to the 

final product quality control. 

 

 Grits could easily be used as aggregates in dense bituminous mixtures for 

regularization layers of road pavements. Physical and mechanical properties that define the 

stability of the material are suitable. This waste is compatible with natural crushed stone 

normally used as aggregate for similar applications. By contrast, the use of dregs in the 

same application requires pre-treatment operations, namely washing to remove soluble 

salts, and then further studies are required to prescribe a better way to treat/adapt this waste 

(cost effective). The soluble salts influence is clearly demonstrated when mixes MBDC1%, 

MBG5% and MBG10% presented a good behaviour in terms of conserved strength (up to 

75%), but formulations   with more than 2%wt of dregs (MBDC2%, MBDC3% and 

MBDC4%) presented water sensitivity. After dregs washing, the tests showed that it is 

possible to obtain a very good performance of formulations with until 4%wt of filler 

replacing by dregs in terms of conserved strength, even with voids content lower than the 

allowed value. This problem could be easily solved by a particle size adjustment of the 



Chapter 10 

169 
 

aggregate. The problem with water sensitivity had been solved with the washing 

procedure. 

 

 Precipitated calcium carbonate (CaCO3) mud is an avoidable by-product when the 

industrial unit is working properly, since it might be reused and fully consumed in the lime 

kiln to regenerate the causticizing agent for the regeneration of digestion liquor. If 

available, as occurred during this work, its properties are compatible with those of 

primary/natural calcium carbonate and it might be used in cement-based products, like 

mortars. The ones prepared and characterized is this thesis show technological properties 

that fulfill the standard requirements. Specifically in terms of bulk, the filler effect is 

obvious, whereby mortar densifies up to an optimum value situated between 10 and 20% 

of LM amount. LM formulations presented compressive strength values between 22 and 23 

MPa at 90 days of curing while reference presented similar results. In general, their 

characteristics are similar to the ones of current industrial formulations and preparation 

conditions are also not much affected. The high moisture content of the mud is the main 

drawback, in terms of transportation for a potential mortar producer. Viable ways to 

minimize it should be search. 

 

The bottom ash generated in bubbling fluidized bed combustors used to burn the 

biomass wastes was here studied in two distinct directions: (i) recycling in rendering or 

adhesive mortar formulations, as sand substitute (used as aggregate); (ii) reuse in 

regenerated beds for further combustion steps. 

For using in mortar formulations the as-collected ash shows suitable particle size 

distribution but the high chlorides content deserve control and the potential use of cleaning 

treatment. The simple washing process tested in industrial-scale trials revealed to be 

effective in reducing the amount (by about 60%) of soluble chlorides in the ash. Once 

treated (sieved), the increasing amount of bottom ash as sand substitute for both products, 

rendering-mortars and cementitious-adhesive mortars. In case of rendering-mortars, been 

ash particles relatively smaller than conventional sand replaced, the thicker mixes had as 

consequence, the flowability of ash-containing mixes decreased. Anyway differences were 

minor and can easily adjustable if required.  



Chapter 10 

170 
 

The tensile adhesion strength at 28 days of curing in standard conditions incresed at 

about 23% (sample with 100% of substitution) when compared with reference (sample 

without BA). A considerable increase of wetting capability and transference values was 

observed, probably associated with the homogeneous particle size distribution of BA and 

with the roughness of its surface. These BA characteristics might explain this increase. 

Indeed, less finer particles demanding less water retard skin formation, leading to better 

transference capability.  

 

 Considering the relevance of the bottom ash characteristics on its application in the 

recycling processes studied here, the monitoring of bottom ash characteristics in a biomass 

thermal power plant confirms that significant variations can occur along the year, namelly 

in terms of chemical elements composition. The chemical element present in higher 

concentration (oxygen is not considered) in the bottom ashes is Si. The amount of Si, 

expressed as SiO2, varied from 79 wt% to 91wt%. The high concentration of Si is related 

with the natural (mostly quartz) sand (&gt;98.5wt% SiO2) used as original bottom bed in the 

BFBC. Considering the relatively high content of inert material (forest soil particles and 

small stones) fed mixed with the biomass, it is expected also that the bottom ash 

composition is influenced by the composition of that inert material. The bottom bed ashes 

are also enriched in chemical elements that can be found in the inorganic fraction of 

biomass, when compared to the original sand bed. That enrichment is noticed also as a 

coating layer around the sand particles of the bed. It was observed that the coating layer 

around the sand particles was not completely removed by water leaching, although a 

decrease on the coating layer thickness occurred after industrial treatment (for example, by 

leaching) of bottom ash particles. The presence of Na and Ca in the coating layer is 

responsible for the formation of a glassy phase that promotes the agglomeration even at 

relatively low bed operation temperature (around 870ºC). Attempting to reuse a fraction of 

the discharged bottom bed sand from the fluidized bed combustor for bed make-up, the 

content of fluxing elements such as Ca, Na and K must be carefully controlled, in order to 

avoid potential agglomeration. 

  

 Regarding the environmental aspects related with the industrial solid wastes 

valorization, this work contributes with results about several possibilities of recycling these 



Chapter 10 

171 
 

wastes as substitute of some raw natural minerals in industrial applications. The wastes 

intensive characterization contributes to industry and research giving important 

information about potential raw materials, the tested applications and results obtained from 

produced and tested formulations demonstrated that it seems to be possible to obtain final 

products with similar characteristics of conventional products. These solutions could avoid 

a significant decrease on wastes landfilling and consequently its recycling could contribute 

to decrease the extraction of non-renewable resources as it is the case of some minerals.   

  

10.2 Future works 

 As proposals for future works it would be interesting to design integrated treatment 

stations in the paper and pulp industries, attempting to optimize washing, sieving and 

drying operations eventually required to adapt certain wastes for future valorization. This 

solution is a step forward in comparison to the existing waste treatment facilities that 

basically involve the wastewater treatment before safety discharge. Moreover, such 

industrial units normally have heat and power available for the requirements of some of the 

novel operation. This concept of circular processes will contribute to fastly achieve 

sustainable indicators that are associated to near zero-waste production. As examples, the 

washing of dregs and bottom ash might be, at least partially, conducted by the treated 

water that is now discharged. Drying of dregs and primary sludge should use the wasted 

heat generated by biomass burning. 

  

All the applications suggested for wastes recycling still deserve assessment of 

durability issues, due to the punctual character and temporal limitations of runned tests. In 

particular, formation of efflorescence and other chemical-related pathology should be 

carefully checked. 

  

Development of a systematic assessment of the environmental consequences 

associated with the tested wastes. This study should involve the quantification and analysis 

of environmental balances (gains and losses) associated with them. Through this evaluation 

it is important to quantify the most relevant environmental discharges involved in all stages 

of life cycle of this ash, from origin, transport, use, and disposal. It would be assessed 



Chapter 10 

172 
 

valuation of the waste solutions for comparative analysis with the current destination. To 

achieve the above would be essential to select the tool to perform the LCA (Life Cycle 

Analysis), and analysis of the benefits and limitations of the chosen methodology. 

An economic analysis about the waste management solutions here tested could be 

also remarkable considering the industry potential interest.

Abstract 

The quality of mortars depends firstly on the characteristics of raw materials. Criteria are 
defined and controlled to guaranty the final product established specifications. Bottom ash 
from eucalyptus bark combustion in a bubbling fluidized bed was tested in partial 
substitution of the standard aggregate (granulometric calibrated sand) used in industrial 
mortars. The relevant characteristics of the new mortars were then evaluated and compared 
with those of the reference (ash-free formulations). Results revealed that bottom ash has 
potential to be recycled in these products, but pre-treatment operations are needed to the 
ash, particularly to remove soluble salts.

INTRODUCTION 

The solid biomass combustion is a proven technology for heat and power generation, and 
fluidized bed and grate furnace equipments are the most common [1; 2]. Fluidized bed 
combustion (FBC) has been used due its economic and environmental benefits in burning 
low-grade coals, biomass and organic wastes, and thereby mixtures of them [1; 3]. These 
furnaces have been applied since 1960 for combustion of municipal solid wastes and 
industrial wastes. Since 1980, more than eight hundred commercial circulating fluidised 
bed boilers have been put into operation in China [4]. In Portugal, the first installation 
started running 20 years ago, in pulp and paper producing industries and also to burn tires 
[3]. Nowadays, Portugal has several plants operating with the fluidized bed technology and 
the future scenario predicts the construction of more units [5]. As a consequence, the 
amount of ashes generated from the process will increase considerably. The high level of 
inert material (soil and little stones from the forest) fed together with the biomass in the 
Portuguese BFBC plants [6] implies a relatively high frequency of bottom bed discharge. 
The production of industrial pre-mixed mortars exceeds one million tons in Portugal, 
consuming then a huge amount of natural pre-treated raw materials (e.g. quarried sand) as 
aggregates. This activity can be looked as a target for the incorporation of ashes, as 
currently happens with the fly ashes from the coal combustion in concrete [7]. 
In this work, the coarse sand fraction used in mortars formulations was (partially and 
completely) substituted by the bottom ash produced during fluidized (bubbling) bed 
combustion of biomass. The ash was used in two conditions: (i) as collected and just sieved 
to obtain a compatible grain size distribution; (ii) and pre-washed (to diminish the amount 
of chlorides) and then sieved. The leaching of chlorides from the components of mortar 
mixes is mandatory, since they cause deleterious effects [8; 9; 10]. The control of grain

size distribution of the aggregates is crucial to adjust the fresh (e.g. workability) and 
hardened (e.g. mechanical strength) properties of the mortars. 

METHODOLOGY 

Material 

The ordinary Portland cement used was CEM I 42.5 R, while the bottom-ashes were 
collected in an industrial fluidized (bubbling) bed combustor using biomassa as fuel in a 
paper-pulp producer (BA – sieved and used as collected) or BAT pre-treated –The 
industrial leaching was performed in continuous and under typical conditions used in an 
industry that makes treatment of natural sand for the construction industry. The leaching 
procedure includes a continuous shower like process using a L/S (liquid to solid) ratio 
equal to 2, and a processing capacity of 10 ton/h; the process includes treatment of the 
leaching solution by sedimentation in order to reuse the liquid solution on the leaching 
process.The chemical composition of ashes was analyzed for some chemical elements 
using X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy –XRF (using a Panalytical Axios spectrometer) 
and the results are expressed in terms of metal oxides, while the crystalline phases were 
detected by X-ray diffraction – DRX (equipment RIGAKU-Geiger flex diffractometer). 
Results are presented in Table 1. The grain size distribution was determined by sieving 
according to NP EN 933:1/2000. The fine grain sand fraction (S1) has particles between 63 
and to 250 µ m, while the coarse fraction (S2) is constituted by larger particles, as shown in 
Figure 1; in the figure it is also presented the grain size distribution of BA and BAT. 
Finally, the Limestone Filler (LSF) has particles between 0.41 to 19.50 µ m, as determined 
by laser interference (Coulter LS230 – measurement interval of 0.04; 2000mm).

Mortars formulations and characterization 

Specific rendering mortars with different amounts of BA and BAT (0, 25, 50 and 100%) 
were produced and tested. BA and BAT were introduced replacing in the formulations the 
coarser sand (S2). Portland cement (type I 42.5R) was used as binder and the binder to 
aggregates mass ratio was kept at 1:6. The amount of water for mixing was fixed (16.5% of 
total mass). 
The particle size distribution of powdered and dried mortars (dust) was controlled 
according to EN 933-1:2000 standard [11]. The preparation of samples included: (i) water 
weighting and addition to the solids; (ii) mixing for 30s at a low rotation speed (60 rpm); 
(iii) stopping for 1 min; (iv) mixing again for 1 min at the same low speed and, (v) keep the 
mixture in stand by for 10 minutes before testing. Fresh state properties were also assessed. 
Workability was evaluated by the spread diameter on the flow table (according to EN 
1015-3:1999) [12] and setting time was measured according to EN 196-3:2005 standard 
[13] (Vicamatic - Automatic Recording Vicat Apparatus). Regarding the hardened state 
mortar properties, specimens with 40×40×160 mm were produced and tested after 7 and 28 
days of curing, according to EN 1015-11:1999 [14]. Compressive and flexural strength 
were evaluated with these samples. Table 2 gives the basic requirements for a suitable 
rendering mortar.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

The decrease of Cl- content in BAT ashes (see Table 1), when compared to BA, reveals the 
efficiency of the washing process. In particular, the reduction of chlorides (about 60%) is 
very important for this application. Their presence usually has an effect of anticipation of 
setting time, but deleterious effects are mostly observed on hardened bodies. 
Table 3 gives the particle size distributions of the prepared formulations, obviously related 
with the size distribution of each single component (Figure 1).  
S2 aggregate present a broader size distribution: below 0.1 mm and up to 1.25 mm, with 50 
vol. % of particles comprised in the 0.5 mm upper fraction. By contrast, BA has a narrower 
distribution (~90 vol. % between the 1mm and 0,5 mm fractions). The washing process 
seems to destroy some agglomerates of BA, and then BAT contains more particles below 
0.5 mm. Its distribution approaches that of S2 size distribution. The control of particle size 
is crucial to define the compactness of the mixtures, then affecting physical and hydration 
behaviour of cementitious mortars.

Figure 2 it is shown the setting time and values of spread diameter on the flow table for the 

mixtures. According to the requirements (see Table 2), the minimum limit for the initial 
setting time is 300 min. The use of BA and BAT tends to diminish setting time, as a 

possible consequence of the presence of chlorides in the ash. This effect is more 
pronounced with the use of BA since it has more chlorides.

Figure 3. Rendering mortars mechanical strength results at 7 and 28 days. 

The workability of the mortars also tend to diminish when the ash is used (the spread 
diameter is lower) and mortars in which the S2 aggregate was fully replaced by BA or 
BAT, workability reached the lower limit. Specifications recommend spread diameters 
between 150 and 180 mm. The lack of fluidity in ash-containing samples might also result 
from a poor particles arrangement and a need for kneading water content adjustment.  
Figure 3 gives the mechanical strength of mortars cured for 7 and 28 days. All samples 
show values well above the required limits: 1.5 and 3.5 MPa, respectively on flexion and 
compression strength. Differences between distinct compositions are not relevant and the 
replacement of S2 by ashes did not degrade the mechanical behavior.  

CONCLUSIONS 

Apart the concern about the presence of chlorides in the ashes, this study suggests that the 
use of the waste in the formulation of rendering mortars, as a substitute of sand, is 
promising. Workability and mechanical strength in mortar containing ashes could be 
controlled and kept on the range for required values for conventional mortars. However, 
further tests should be conducted to prove the sustainability of the proposed solution. 
Long-term or durability tests are also recommended.

ABSTRACT 
Lime-mud is a solid waste generated in pulp mill plants in considerable amounts. 
Its homogeneous chemical and physical characteristics allow valorization 
opportunities in the construction materials sector, namely in mortars. In this paper, 
a potential waste management solution was evaluated regarding the viability of 
this waste incorporation with a clear benefit in terms of natural raw materials 
savings. 
The lime-mud characterization and its incorporation in cement-based mortars 
were appraised. The lime-mud effect on fresh and hardened state properties in 
different mortars formulations was assessed. Workability and mechanical strength 
were some of the critical features evaluated in this work.  
Due to the high moisture content of this waste, the work was developed with the 
waste in its natural state, saving water and energy costs, taking into account 
environmental and economic factors by avoiding the waste pre-treatment. 

Keywords: Lime-mud; cement-mortars; waste management. 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Large amounts of industrial wastes have been stabilized with cement or used as an additive 
material in cement related manufacturing sector [1;2;3]. The pulp and paper industry is a 
source of a wide range of solid residues. Both inorganic (ash, dregs and grits) and organic 
(sludges) solid wastes are generated during the different stages in bleached kraft pulp 
production. The chemical composition of the sludge, dregs and grits is dependent on the 
manufacturing and effluent treatment processes and raw materials, and the composition of 
the ash is dependent on the fuels and combustion techniques used at individual mills [4]. 
Alternative ecological and economic waste recovery techniques have been developed and 
implemented in pulp and paper industry due to the increase in the amount of waste and the 
pressure from public opinion in the last decade. Waste handling is a concern in pulp and 
paper mills as well as in all industrial plants [5]. Best available techniques for reducing 
waste involve minimizing the generation of solid waste or to reuse these materials, 
whenever practicable [6]. Building construction industry is a valid option to drain large 
quantitative of solid wastes and, as a consequence, avoid natural resources use. Several 
authors have been studying several alternatives of pulp and paper wastes valorisation 
replacing partially or completely conventional raw materials. Ahmadi and Alkhaja (2001) 
[7] tested with success primary sludge as a replacement filler material in concrete mixes. 
Eroglu H. et al (2007) [8] studied lime mud in composite cement manufacturing and the 
results suggested that the waste is practically an additive for this application. Considering

limestone one of the most used raw materials in the construction sector, this work intends 
to assess a solid waste with similar characteristics of limestone powder, namely as a 
standard filler. In this work, lime-mud (LM), a solid waste mainly composed by calcium 
carbonate and small amount of magnesium carbonate [9] generated from pulp and paper 
mill in the chemical recovery process, was studied as a replacement to a standard limestone 
mineral filler (SF) in cement-mortars. Both LM and SF were chemically, mineralogical and 
physically characterized and the results compared. Cement based mortars were produced 
and tested. 
In the case of mortars, workability parameters in the fresh state were measured using a 
flow table. Flow table is a traditional method to determine the workability of mortars. 
Although it is easy to use and widespread around the world, this technique does not 
discriminate the yield stress and plastic viscosity, which are important parameters to define 
the rheological behavior of mortars [10,11]. For that reason, a rheometer has been used for 
this purpose. In terms of the rheological behaviour, mortars typically behave as a Bingham 
fluid, being characterized by a yield stress and a plastic viscosity. The rheological 
behaviour was studied with a specific mortar rheometer (Viskomat PC, Schleibinger) that 
is able to quantify those factors. This apparatus automatically measures torque, up to a 
limit of 300 N.mm, following a preset speed-time program. The Bingham behaviour can be 
expressed as the torque (T) to rotation speed (N) relation, T = g + hN, where g and h are 
coefficients directly proportional to yield stress and plastic viscosity, respectively [12-15]. 
Additionally, the mechanical strength up to 28 days of curing, the apparent density, water 
absorption and porosity were measured. 

EXPERIMENTAL 

Materials 

The ordinary Portland cement (PC) used in this study was a CEM II 32.5 R type produced 
by Secil (Portugal). The lime-mud was collected from paper pulp mill, where 420.000 
t/year of this waste in dry base is produced. It is an industrial solid waste obtained from re-
causticizing process inserted in the chemical recovery process circuit. The calibrated 
standard limestone mineral filler was a commercial one. This material is conventionally 
used as filler in industrial mortars. PC has an average particle size of 14 µm and a Blaine 
fineness of 0.47m2/g, LM has a particle size distribution between 0.5 to 26 µ m (average 10 
µ m) and a surface area of 5.17 m2/g (BET) and the SF has a particle size distribution 
between 0.5 to 9 µ m (average 2.8 µ m) and a surface area of 3.44 m2/g (BET). The sand 
particle size was below 1,2 mm (EN 933-1: 2000) [16]. The chemical composition data 
(determined by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy) of LM and SF are illustrated in Table 1.

Methods 

Mortars using different amounts of lime-mud and standard lime filler (0, 6, 12 and 18 %) 
were produced and tested (Table 2). Lime-mud was used in its natural condition, as-
received from the paper pulp mill with 34% of moisture. This LM water was discounted 
from nominal water content used to produce the mortars. The total water and the 
superplasticiser used in the mortars mixtures were 62% and 0.07% in relation to cement 
content, respectively. The LM and SF were used as fillers in substitution of sand by weight 
in dry base. The formulations were evaluated through rheology and flow table 
measurements, assuring that all the samples exhibited an adequate condition to be tested in 
both equipments. In this way, it was possible to obtain a complete characterization of their 
fresh state behavior. A complementary study of these mortars in the hardened state was 
also developed. 
The procedures used to prepare the formulations included: (i) placing lime-mud and the 
rest of mortar components into water; (ii) mixing for 1 min at a low rotation speed of 60 
rpm; (iii) stopping for 1 min; (iv) mixing again for 1 min at a higher rotation speed (120 
rpm). The rheometer measured the rheological behavior of fresh mortars, with a maximum 
speed rotation of 100 rpm during 60 minutes of total test time. The workability of mortars 
was measured through the “slump” on flow table, according to EN 1015-3:1999 [17]. 
Mortars specimens with 40 × 40 × 160 mm were produced for the mechanical test and 
tested after 28 curing, according to EN 1015-11:1999 [18]. Specific density, apparent 
porosity and water absorption were also determined with two flexural specimen remains by 
the immersion technique.

Results and Discussion 

The high content of CaCO3 in LM makes this waste an interesting material to be used as 
filler, although LM and SF exhibited some significant differences like the particle size, 
specific surface area and Na2O content. For that reason, such differences may be the main 
responsible for distinct performance on the mortars.  
Fig. 2 exhibits the torque values of mortars containing LM, SF and control (0%). In 
general, the torque values of samples with LM reached the highest results if compared to 
the SF substitution. 
When very fine particles with higher surface area are added in the mortars, they can modify 
the fresh state behavior, since the free water available in the mixture tend to decrease. 
Thus, particle friction in such samples is higher than those samples without additions. 
Moreover, in the control sample, the superplasticiser can act exclusively on the cement 
particles increasing the free water, responsible for keeping particles separate by a certain 
distance. In addition, describing mortars rheological behavior as a Bingham fluid means 
that the material acts as a rigid body at low stresses but flows, as a viscous fluid, at high 
stress having a linear relationship between shear stress and strain rate once the threshold 
shear stress is exceeded [12]. The vertical lines above the torque line of the mixtures (fig. 
2) indicate intense structural formation during the test stop period (when rotation speed 
goes to zero rpm). Such behavior was more evident on the samples with higher content of 
LM and at the end of the test.

registered values constant. LM mortars plastic viscosity can also be confirmed through the 
flow table (spread diameter) results on Table 3. The spread decreases with the LM content 
increase. The maximum yield stress was observed in LM18% samples when compared to 
the control sample, while low constant values were registered on samples with 12% and 
18% of SF.

Table 4 presents the mortars hardened state characterization. The results show that LM 
does not affects significantly mortars density and strength, as well as the porosity or water 
absorption when compared to SF samples. The standard limestone filler (SF) containing 
mortars presents slightly higher values of the compressive strength and lower porosity, 
which might be related to its particle size distribution that might improve compaction.

The characterization results indicate that lime-mud from pulp and paper mill represents a 
waste with similar chemical and physical properties.

The use of this waste (lime-mud) in mortars affects significantly their rheology when 
compared to SF mortars results and the control sample: 

(i) The increase of LM content decreases the mortars fluidity, improving the cohesion 
between the material particles in fresh state; 

(ii) LM addition is equivalent to removing water from the system causing torque and 
yield stress increase and plastic viscosity decrease. 

The hardened properties of mortars are not hindered with LM addition when compared to 
control samples. The LM waste use in cement-based materials as mortars can represent a 
good alternative for thousands of tonnes of this waste per year. This application avoids 
waste landfilling and also saves of natural resources as lime.

Abstract 

Sludges obtained as marble and granite waste sawing and polishing production process was 
characterized from chemical and physical point of view in order to use them as mineral 
addition for mortars. The formulations were prepared using two types of sludges (LS – 
Loom sludge and PS – Polishing sludge) in 5 and 10% (wt %) of cement replacement with 
water/cement ratio of 0.6. The sludges were also tested in cement paste replacement in 
10% (wt%) with water/cement ratio of 0.45. The mortars formulations were defined 
through the flow table and rheometer behavior purposing to achieve a suitable workability. 
The appraised properties were rheology, spread, heat of hydration, physics (density, 
porosity and water absorption) and compressive strength (at 28 days). Results obtained 
showed that 10% cement replacement by the sludge provided mortars production without 
associated damages to the final product. This waste valorisation represents an important 
waste outflow for the ornamental stones sector, avoiding wastes landfill disposal. 

Introduction 

In recent years, the environmental damage and the wastes generated from industrial activity, 
increased significantly worldwide. Thus, the raw natural materials have become scarce and 
the adverse impacts on the environment are visible [1, 2, 3]. The ornamental stones 
production (including extraction, cutting, sawing and stone blocks polishing) generates 
about 30 to 40% of loses [4]. In the natural stone sector, the processors convert the quarries 
extracted blocks in intended pieces for floor coverings, household applications, the funerary 
art, sculpture and more. The subsector includes extracting and processing companies, 
mainly limestone and granite, whose production is intended primarily for the construction 
sector (inert or granules and gravel), and also to the chemical, steel-metallurgy and food 
processing. This is an important activity in Portugal. There are over 1250 companies in this 
sector and 11,000 over employees. The global production in terms of raw material processed 
is mentioned in more than 1.6 million tonnes [5]. The extraction and processing involves 
essentially two natural stone types, marble and granite. The sludges are the main generated 
waste (LER 01 05 04). Generally, their composition is stone waste, sand, lime and 
sometimes steel balls (due to the abrasive material recirculation). Sawing, cutting and 
polishing operations produce about 0.10 m3 of sludge per ton of processed stone: 0.08 m3 of 
sawdust in the operation and 0.02 m3 in grinding and cutting. (one cubic meter of sludge is 
equivalent to 2,7 tonnes). [6]. The ornamental stone sludge is a fine particle with high 
tendency to agglomerate, difficulty a homogenous distribution in the mixtures. The fine 
particles can act as micro filler in the matrix, but at same time decreases the workability of

mortars. Although, the sludge is not considered a hazardous waste (Class I), in many cases, 
there is no concern in these tailings reutilization and, therefore, they are dumped in lakes 
and rivers directly without any pre-treatment. 
Nowadays, the final disposal or the reutilization of fine powder from ornamental stones 
industry as industrial wastes are considered one of the biggest environmental problems 
worldwide [7]. In this way, many attempts [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] have been testing such wastes, 
especially in the construction industry, as tile, asphalt aggregate, brick, cement, concrete, clay 
products. So, it is possible to minimize the waste environmental negative impact and at same 
time add it some value. Although, some authors [10, 7, 8] have been tested the stone marble 
sludge in mortars, the use of rheology and spread on table are rarely used as considered 
parameters to define the mortars formulations. The flow table is a traditional method used in 
mortars to determine workability. It does not measure the yield stress and plastic viscosity 
separately due its constant load application. So, the rheometer has been used for this purpose. 
Traditionally, mortars, cement paste and concrete rheological behavior has been measured by 
the Bingham model. 
The rheometer is capable of measures the rheological parameters for a wide values range at 
same time. The cement mixtures rheological behavior is described by the Bingham 
equation:  
? = ?o µp?                                                                                                                            (1) 
 where ? (Pa) is the shear stress, ?o (Pa) is the yield stress, µp (Pa*s) is the plastic viscosity 
and ? (s-1) is the shear rate. Some rheometers measures torque T as a function of rotational 
speed N then the Bingham model has been also expressed by the following equation:  
T = g + hN                                                                                                                          (2) 
where g (N mm) and h (N mm min) are directly proportional to the yield stress and plastic 
viscosity respectively. 
Systematic studies applying a methodology of experimental design are not frequently used 
in cement based materials. However, they can assist to identify the main effects and their 
interactions of the constituents [chemical admixtures, mineral additions and W/B 
(water/binder) ratio][14]. 
This paper aims to reuse the ornamentals stone sludge, as cement partial replacement (0, 5 
and 10 wt %) to produce mortars based on mixtures formulation according to flow table 
and rheology performance. 

Experimental 

Materials 

The Portland cement used in this paper was a CEM I 42.5 R. It has an average particle of 
14 µm and the Blaine fineness 0.35 m2/g, while the chemistry composition is showed in 
Table 1. Loom sludge (LS) and polishing sludge (PS) were used in dried condition as 
replaced of Portland cement. LS has a particle size distribution between 1.50 to 77.8 µ m 
and average 15.7 µ m and surface area of 3.7 m2/g (BET), while PS has between 1.23 to 
55.6 µ m and average 11.2 µ m and  7.2 m2/g, respectively. The chemistry compositions was 
obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (Shimadzu, EDX-700), while the 
pozzolanicity was determined by Standard EN 196-5:2005 [15].  

Mortars and paste testing procedures  



VI International Materials Symposium, Materials 2011, Braga, PORTUGAL 

 

Mortars and pastes were produced, using different amounts (5 and 10 wt%) of ornamental 
sludge. Mortars with 1:3 cement/aggregate weight ratio and 0.6 water/cement weight ratio 
(w/c) were produced to rheology, flow table, compressive strength, water absorption and 
apparent porosity. Meanwhile, the cement paste with 0.45 w/c was utilized to the 
temperature of hydration. The components were weighed and mixed in the mechanical 
mixing (CONTROLS, 65-LS). The procedures included: (i) Water addition to the dry 
powder mix; (ii) Mix for 1 min at a low rotation speed of 60 rpm; (iii) Stop for 1 min to 
gather the mix into the centre; (iv) Mix again for 1 min at a higher rotation speed (120 
rpm). The rheological behaviour of fresh mortars was measured by a rheometer (Viskomat 
PC). It was used a maximum speed rotation (100 rpm) and 250 minutes of test time. The 
workability of mortar was measured through “spread” on flow table according to EN 1015-
3:1999 [16]. For the mechanical test, mortars specimens with 40 × 40 × 160 mm were 
performed. The moulds were covered with plastic bags for 24 h to avoid water loss. After 
24 h, all the samples were immersed in water for curing during 27 days and the 
compressive strength was determined by EN 1015-11:1999 [17]. Water absorption, 
porosity and apparent density were also determined by the immersive techniques [18]. The 
heat of hydration was tested in cement paste samples during 24 h. This parameter was 
measured in a quasiadiabatic calorimeter (Langavant). The cement pastes were thermally 
isolated in boxes stored in a curing chamber at 20 ?C of temperature and 65% of relative 
humidity.

Results and Discussion 

Rheology and flow table measurements 

When ultra fines particles with higher surface area than Portland cement are used in 
mortars, they can modify the fresh and hardened properties. If flow table and rheometer are 
used to define a set of formulations of mortars, the maximum amount to be added is 
reduced, since the minimum plasticity requires for such equipments are different. On the 
other hand, it permits to achieve a better characterization. In general, the torque values and 
yield stress changed markedly when the Portland cement was replaced to sludges (Fig. 1

and Fig. 2). However, the plastic viscosity did not show a noticeable difference (Table 2). 
Such additions exhibit higher surface area than particle cement and consequently, the free 
water available in the mixture decreased. As consequence, the particle friction and three-
dimensional structures formation tend to increases.

Figure 8. Ornamental stones sludges and control mortars rheological behaviour (Torque). 

The torque values of sludge samples increased compared to the control samples. As PS has 
a higher surface area than LS, a high value of initial torque was obtained. On the other 
hand, such characteristic was not enough to keep the results above the LS level after 75 
min. In addition, both sludges samples showed low plasticity and the Bingham model 
accuracy became poorer, while the vertical line above of the torque line shows intense 
structures formation during the test stop period.

Heat of hydration 

In general, when the Portland cement is mixed with water, two main peaks can be 
observed. The first peak occurs few minutes after contact with water, where several Ca2+,

+, K+, and OH- ions are releases to the aqueous solution from gypsum, C3S, C3A 
and C4AF phases. Meanwhile, the second peaks occur after dormant period finished, 
caused by faster crystallization of CH and C-S-H.

In general, the presence of sludges influenced significantly the results in both of cases. In 
the first peaks, the cement replaced by PS and LS seems that was determinate to the 
results. However, such formulations showed lower dormant period, as well as, increased 
faster the temperature in relation to the control (Fig. 3). Thus, the hydraulic charter of 
sludges can be appointing as responsible for the results. In addition, the heterogeneous 
chemical activation nuclei can be also considered to the results. The fast temperature

increasing might induce micro cracking to material due to internal stress. Such 
formulation, showed the highest values of torque in relation to the control samples, 
suggesting that there is a relationship between them. 

 
Figure 11. Ornamental stones sludges pozzolanicity results. 

Water absorption, apparent porosity and compressive strength 

The addition of ultrafine particles in cement based materials can contribute to fill out the 
space (physical effect – Table 2) or react with calcium hydroxide (pozzolanic effect – Fig. 
4), resulting in calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H). In general, the results showed that up to 
10% of sludge incorporation doesn’t modify significantly the physical properties of 
mortars. Probably, the microfiller effect can contribute to the results, despite the reduction 
of cement in the material. However, the compressive strength was reduced significantly, 
despite the material exhibits pozzolanic effect. In this case, this characteristic was attenuate 
by cement replaced (Table 2). 

Conclusions 

The optimal working interval definition for fresh mortars based on simultaneous 
information obtained from flow table and rheometer tests is complex. The reduction of 
plasticity of mortars is denoted by enhance of applied torque, while there is a spread 
reduction in the flow table test. In both cases, this tendency could be explained by an 
increasing friction between surface grains and plasticity lost. It is feasible to use the 
rheometer to evaluate the mortars rheological parameters. Increasing finer mortars content 
thought ornamental stone sludge addition increases the torque and the yield stress. A 
verified advantage was to replace 10% of cement by ornamental stones sludge without 
bringing material damages. 10% of theses sludges addition doesn’t modify significantly the 
mortars physical and mechanical properties. According to the exposed, cement can be 10% 
replaced in mortars production without associated damages to the final product. This waste 
valorisation represents an important waste outflow for the ornamental stones sector, 
avoiding wastes landfill disposal.

Abstract 
The use of solid wastes in the building industry can contribute to achieve the sustainable 
development of this sectorial activity, while it might help to reduce production costs. In 
this way, the experimental research here presented evaluates the influence of Red Mud 
particles (RM) on the fresh and hardened properties of cured mortars up to 28 days. 
Portland cement was replaced up to 50 wt.% RM, adjusting the relative amount of water 
(36–48 wt.%) in order to get mortars with suitable workability as defined by rheometry and 
flow table measurements. Temperature of hydration, water absorption and compressive 
strength were also determined. RM decreases the workability and increases the yield stress 
of the material. Mortars with similar spread on table showed different behaviour along the 
rheology test. RM did not change significantly the dormant period, but the magnitude of 
exothermic peak is reduced when the Portland cement was replaced by RM above 20 wt.%. 
The water absorption increased when the cement was replaced by RM, while the 
compressive strength exhibited an opposite tendency.  

Introduction 

The red mud is a residue generated in large scale from the Bayer process used to produce 
alumina. Through this process, bauxite is digested in a concentrated caustic soda (NaOH) 
solution at high pressure and moderate temperatures (~270 ºC), in order to obtain the 
alumina trihydrate (Al2O3.3H2O) [1][2]. This process leads to the formation of insoluble 
hydroxides where the impurities are concentrated, after proper washing, settling, and 
filtration operations. Such is the case of the red mud, containing goethite (?-FeOOH), 
hematite (?-Fe2O3), bohemite (?AlO(OH)), quartz (SiO2), sodalite (Na4Al3SiO12Cl), and 
gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) as major phases, and calcite (CaCO3), whewellite (CaC2O4.H2O), 
gibbsite (Al(OH)3), and TiO2 as minor components [1]. In general, the production of 1 ton 
alumina generates 1-2 ton (dry basis) of red mud. Thus, the storage of these massive 
amounts is economically and environmentally problematic, due to the risk of 
contamination of natural resources and living organisms [3][4]. Therefore, the main 
purpose of this work is investigating the impact of red mud on the rheological properties of

mortars. Complementary fresh and hardened state properties of mixtures are also 
evaluated. 

Materials and Methods 

Portland cement (PC - type I 42.5R, according to EN 197-1 [5] was used as binder. It has a 
specific area of 0.35 m2/g (Blaine fineness), average particle size of 14 µm and its 
chemical composition is given in Table 10. Red mud (RM) slurry (Alcoa, Spain), here used 
as partial substitute of Portland cement, contains about 61 wt.% solids, specific area of 20 
m2/g, particle size distribution between 0.1 to 7 µm (average 0.78 µm), and chemical 
composition illustrated in Table 10. Superplasticizer (SP) used to adjust the plasticity of 
fresh mortars is based on a polycarboxylic acid (Glenium 52, Basf), with density between 
1.067-1.107g/cm³. The sand used as aggregate is composed by three particle size fractions 
(1.2, 0.6 and 0.3 mm), each one corresponding to 33.33 wt.%.

Testing procedures 

The RM particles were used as partial substitute of Portland cement, in levels up to 50 wt% 
(Table 11 and Figure 1). An extra dosage of water (W) was required in mixtures containing 
more than 15 % RM to keep the spread value in 200 mm. In addition, the SP was fixed in 
0.25 wt.% and binder-to-aggregate weight ratio was also fixed (1:3). Red mud was used in 
the as-received condition (as a paste), and the quantity of water incorporated by the RM 
was considered to reduce the volume required to prepare each mixture. The solid 
components of the blends were mixed inside a plastic bag for 1 min, while the 
superplasticizer was mixed into water, before addition to the solids. The mixing of the 
paste was conducted for 3.5 min.

The rheological behaviour of fresh mortars was measured in a rheometer (Viskomat PC, 
Germany) for testing cement pastes and mortars (Figure 2a), while the flow table (Figure 
2b) was performed immediately after mixing, following the EN 1015-3 [6].  
 

 
Figure 2 (a) Rheometer and (b) flow table test. 

The maximum rotation speed was 100 rpm and at every 15 min the speed was brought to 
zero, kept as that for 30 s, and was then increased to 100 rpm during 30 s. The rheological 
parameters, namely, plastic viscosity (h) and yield stress (g) were obtained from Bingham 
model [7].  



I Congresso Luso-Brasileiro de Materiais de Construção Sustentáveis 2014, Braga, PORTUGAL 

 

The temperature of hydration was monitored in a quasi-adiabatic calorimeter (Langavant), 
while the water absorption of hardened mortars was determined by an immersive technique 
[8]. The compression strength was determined according to the EN 1015-11 standard [9]. 
Samples with 40 × 40 × 160 mm were used, as prescribed by EN 196-1 [10]. The curing 
was firstly conducted in room conditions with samples placed inside the moulds (covered 
by plastic bags and for 24 h), followed by immersion in water for 28 days. 

Results and Discussion 

Rheometry and flow table measurements 

When the flow table and rheometer were used as parameters for determining the 
composition of mixtures, an additional difficulty in defining the experimental plan was 
observed. Such equipments differ in terms of minimum plasticity required. To evaluate the 
effect of higher levels of RM in mortars, it was necessary to fix the value of spread on 
table (200 mm), in a condition that permits their evaluation in the rheometer and flow 
table, simultaneously. 
In general, RM particles increased the yield stress and plastic viscosity regardless the water 
content added (Figure 3). As RM particles are smaller and have higher surface area than 
PC grains, they reduce the amount of free water required to lubricate the solid particles. As 
a result, the internal friction of particles increased and the plasticity of mixture diminished. 
In addition, the ultra-fine particles in suspension have a stronger tendency to agglomerate, 
which hampers the adequate flow of the mixture. 
The yield stress also increased by prolonging the measurements. Particle collisions, 
formation of a three-dimensional structure upon hydration, and concomitant reduction of 
free water available are possible causes for that variation. The evolution of plastic viscosity 
does not show a defined tendency and, therefore, the effect of RM is better accounted by 
looking to the yield stress. Although the values of the initial yield stress are similar for 
samples with 20, 30 and 40 wt.% RM, they exhibited significant differences during the 
rheology test. 

Temperature of hydration 

Samples showed two main peaks on curves representing the temperature variation upon 
curing (Figure 4). The first peak occurred in the first moments after contact with water, 
while the second peak has its maximum at 11-13 h but starts after 4-6 h. 
The presence of RM particles did not accelerate the hydration process. As expected from 
the slight hydraulic character of RM, its use as binder (PC replacement) should delay the 
hydration reactions. However, when used up to 15% differences are small when compared 
with REF mortar (RM-free). The fineness of RM particles might be responsible for their 
action as heterogeneous chemical activation nuclei for the hydration of cement [11]. In 
addition, samples containing higher RM levels reached lower maximum temperature.

Water absorption and compressive strength of hardened samples 

Samples showed higher water absorption when red mud and water levels increased (Figure 
5). The combined effect of RM and W strongly increased the water absorption, confirming 
again the non-hydraulic character of the mud. Hardened samples will show higher volume 
of open pores. Despite the possible capacity of RM particles to fill in the pores of the 
material, due to their fineness, this effect is not sufficient to compensate the lower extent of 
chemical reactivity and hydrates formation. As a consequence, the compression strength of 
samples will diminish when RM level is higher (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Compression strength (MPa) of mortars after curing at 28 days 

 
 
The compressive strength of samples 7.5RM + 36W, 15RM + 38W and 30RM + 40W 
reduced respectively 12, 25 and 59% regarding the REF. RM particles can adsorb some 
water, and then the available amount for cement hydration become insufficient to complete 
the reactions. Mortars with 20, 30, 40 and 50 wt.% RM showed a successive loose of 
mechanical resistance, since the relative amount of cement diminished. Moreover, the 
required amount of water to reach suitable workability of the mixtures tends to increase, 
leaving pores after drying/curing. 

Conclusions 

The differences (relative to REF) of initial yield stress for mixtures with RM are not 
constant and also depend on W. By contrast, the plastic viscosity does not change too

much. Mortars with 20, 30 and 40 wt.% RM exhibited similar values of initial yield stress, 
but during the rheology test the behaviour of such mixtures tend to be distinct. RM does 
not significantly delay the hydration process. However, for high RM amounts (above 20 
wt.%) the maximum temperature decreased. Hardened samples show higher water 
absorption and lower mechanical strength when RM level increases. This also confirms the 
non-hydraulic character of the mud. Such tendencies are also affected by the W added.

ABSTRACT 
 
Lime-mud is a solid waste generated in pulp mill in considerable amounts. It is a 
waste chemical and physically homogeneous, basically composed by calcium 
carbonate which allows valorization opportunities in the construction materials 
sector and, in this specific case study, in lightweight aggregates (LWA).  
In this paper, a potential management solution was evaluated regarding the viability 
of using lime mud at industrial scale. The test was developed using lime mud as 
raw material with total substitution of conventional limestone powder on 
fabrication of lightweight aggregates. The industrial process was evaluated 
considering some limitations on operations logistic due to the lime mud moisture 
content. Involved costs were estimated for the waste management solution and the 
impact on final product basic characteristics was assessed.  
The obtained results indicate that lime mud presents high potential of utilisation as 
raw material in lightweight aggregate production but, in what basic characteristics 
are concerned, the waste moisture content must be taken into consideration.

INTRODUCTION 

According to several authors, pulp mill industry generates various potential solid wastes 
that could easily be used as raw material in construction sector due its basic chemical and 
physical characteristics and, in some cases, even improve some of their properties 
0[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7].  
The extraction of natural aggregates for use in construction is associated with significant 
adverse environmental effects [8]. In recent years, the environmental damage and the 
wastes generated from industrial activity increased significantly worldwide. Thus, natural 
raw materials have become scarce and the adverse impacts on the environment are visible 
[9][10],[11]. Construction sector is able to drain large solid wastes and in consequence 
avoid natural resources consumption [12],[13],[14]. Several types of wastes have been 
exhaustively tested in lightweight aggregates (LWA) production, but most of them have 
been used to replace an expansive material. Sarabèr et al (2012)[15] for example, tested fly 
ash from coal fired power in this application. The results showed that adequate LWA can 
be produced. Meanwhile, Wang et al (2009) [16] also tested coal fly ash but blended with 
dry sewage sludge.

In terms of raw material, this product can be manufactured by thermally treatment of clays, 
shale, siliceous rock or slate and also uses in its composition, water and limestone coating 
powder (LSCP). The LSCP specific function in the LWAs is related with covering the 
LWA pellets surface avoiding their agglomeration in the rotary kiln and also contributes to 
the formation of a denser external surface to avoid water absorption. 
Considering limestone one of the most used raw-material in the construction sector, this 
work intends to assess a solid waste from pulp mill process, namely a lime mud (LM), with 
similar chemical, physical and mineralogical characteristics with limestone filler, as 
replacement material for standard LSCP conventionally used in LWAs production. LM is a 
solid waste generated from pulp and paper mill in the chemical recovery process mainly 
composed of calcium carbonate and small amount of magnesium carbonate and it is 
estimated that about 0.47m3 of lime mud is generated to produce 1 ton of pulp 
[17][18],[5],[19]. In this specific study, the pulp mill generates approximately 
360ton/month (in dry base). 
From a waste management perspective, the focus of this study is to evaluate the 
replacement potential of LM in lightweight aggregate production as a substitute material of 
LSCP at industrial scale. This paper presents the research work developed in industrial 
scale (process stages and final product). The comparative study of the raw-materials was 
used as criteria decision for industrial test. Energy costs related to drying lime mud process 
was also assessed. In terms of waste flow capacity and related economic aspects of the 
application, as well as logistic and technical problems due to LM properties (mainly related 
to moisture content) some parameters were registered and also compared. In industrial 
scale approximately 25 tons of LM in LWA production was tested. Process parameters as 
machine stream, operation time, energy costs related to LM moisture elimination and the 
waste transportation were measured or calculated and compared with the conventional 
process.   
The consumption of LSCP is around 300 tonsdry base/month only in one LWA mill. This fact 
implies that the process could drain large amount of LM per year. It would permit the 
drainage of approximately 80% of the lime mud produced in this pulp mill located around 
30km of the LWAs mill installation. This waste management option as a valorization 
solution could avoid the waste landfilling, the reduction of natural resources extraction and 
also to save costs for both sectors, lightweight aggregate and pulp paper industries. 
Assuming the agreement with the involved companies, this work uses the denominations 
“factory X” for the pulp mill which generates the lime mud and “factory Y” for the LWA 
mill with the waste final application. 

EXPERIMENTAL 
 
Materials 
 
Raw-materials were characterized in terms of chemical, physical (grain size distribution 
and bulk density) and mineralogical properties. LM used in this research was collected in 
the washing stage as illustrated in Fig 1.

This LM presents approximately 20% of moisture content. The raw-material main 
characteristics are presented in Table 1. The particle size distribution was determined by 
laser diffraction in the range between 0.04 and 2000 µ m (Beckman Coulter LS230). The 
crystalline phases present in dried materials were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
and the chemical composition was determined by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF). 
Raw materials weight and energy changes were also analysed by thermogravimetry and 
differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA). SEM (Scanning electron microscope) observation 
was used to assess LM and LSCP microstructures. LSCP and clay pellets (CP) were 
supplied by factory Y.

Methods 

LWA industrial test 

Conventional data process was registered during 4 hours before the industrial test with LM. 
The lime mud was incorporated in wet base. The data were collected each 15 minutes 
during all period of the test. The LSCP flow (kg/h) in the entrance of rotary drum and the 
kiln average exit temperature (ºC) were monitored. The standard lightweight aggregate is 
referred as LWAs and the one incorporating lime mud is named as LWAw. In both cases 
density and flow rate were controlled and registered. The industrial test with the lime mud 
waste was developed in 2,5 hours.

Valorization solution limitations 
To assure the proper functioning stages of the process, considering the high level moisture 
content of LM, costs related to a silo and drying equipment were also estimated. 

Industrial scale - Logistic 
A truck with 25 tons of capacity conducted the waste as collected to the LWA mill (factory 
Y) and stored during half day. The waste was placed near the production line equipment to 
be used in the same day in total substitution of the conventional LSCP. The LM was 
introduced in the system by two ways. The first, in the conveyors belt through the worn 
straw and in the second, it was introduced manually into the rotary drum. 

LWA industrial test database 
Factory Y supplied the estimated costs related to raw-material consumption, drying process 
and investment for assessment. In this research the investment amortization period 
considered was about 10 years. Table 2 presents the database for assessment of the 
valorization solution. The first calculation was based on the energy flows, to vaporize 
water (M) in Kcal/kg of water and drying LM (N) in kcal/kg of Lime Mud, where: 

M = (D+E)*(100+(100-F))/100 (Eq. 1) 
 

Where, D= Vaporization latent heat; E= Water heating energy (until 100ºC); F= Dryer 
efficiency; and, 
 

N = (C/100)*M (Eq. 2) 
 

Where, C= Lime mud moisture content. 
 
The fuel need to dry the lime mud (O) in kg fuel/kg LM was calculated through the 
following equation: 
 

O = N/G (Eq. 3) 
 

Where, G= Calorific power of fuel.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Calcite is the main crystalline phase in both materials (LSCP and LM) as can be seen in 
Table 1. Thermal gravimetric and differential analyses (TG/DTA) of raw materials were 
performed up to 1000ºC with a heating rate of 10ºC/min. The results are presented on 
Figure 4. Before performing the analysis, the raw materials were dried at 105ºC. The 
weight loss exhibited by both materials, between 800ºC and 900ºC is related with the 
decomposition of calcium carbonate. 
Although LM presents higher level of sodium than LSCP the chemical analysis confirms 
how similar they are. The differences of other oxides contents are not relevant between 
these materials and for the application. 
Observing Table 3, the average flow of production during the test with LM is not different 
from the conventional LWA production result (average from 8:00 to 12:00h). The density 
of LWAw seems to be slightly lower than LWAs (~5%) but negligible looking at the 
standard deviation of 11 kg/m3. According to factory Y reports, the same variation happens 
in the conventional production process.

The first concern about introducing LM in the production process of factory Y would be 
drying it. Technically any drying process implicates energy consumption. In this specific 
case, assuming the involved costs (see Table 2) provided by factory Y, the estimated total 
costs for the drying and processing of the LM is around 10.17€/ton. Transportation costs 
are not included in this value, only investments in drying equipment, employee and energy 
costs. The factory X would transport the LM waste to factory Y to warranty this estimated 
total cost. Assuming this as the implemented management solution, the benefits for factory 
Y would be the saved costs with the conventional raw material (around 7.33€/ton). 
Assuming 89% of LSCP replacement level (Table 4) for LM and an amount of 2904 
ton/year in total used material, the factory Y could save approximately 21.000,00€/year as 
liquid benefit.  

Table 4. Cost-benefits analysis of the solution according to factory Y. 

 

According to cost-benefits assessment estimated here for factory X, and considering the 
actual landfill tax estimated in 30€/ton of waste dry base, the savings would be in the order 
of 26.4€/ton of LM (194 ton of LM d.b.), more than 60.000€/year. But, in another 
perspective, if factory X assumes the transportation and drying costs related to the waste 
management, instead of saving 26.4€/ton, the factory would save 16.24€/ton of LM [30€ 
(LM landfilling) – 3,6 ( LM transport) – 10.17 (LM drying and processing) = 16.24). In 
this situation, the total saving amount would be around 38.000€/year. 

CONCLUSIONS 

The high content of CaCO3 in LM makes this waste an interesting material to be used as 
mineral aggregate in this application.  The characterization results indicate that lime mud 
from pulp and paper mill represents a waste with similar chemical and physical properties 
comparing with LSCP used in LWA production. Technically the industrial test with LM 
was successfully performed. The industrial test showed that LM represents a potential 
material for being used in LWA production as alternative raw material. According to the 
estimated values, factory X would avoid landfilling around 3.000 tons of LM a year. This 
fact, combined to saving costs and natural resources extraction saving permits to conclude 
that this valorization solution is a viable one generating savings on both sides.

Abstract 

The management of bottom bed ashes from biomass combustion in bubbling fluidized bed 
combustors (BFBC) is a major issue, namely considering operating problems and 
environmental aspects. 
Bottom bed ashes from combustion of forest biomass residues in BFBC were studied. The 
ashes were characterized considering particle size distribution, chemical composition, and 
water leaching. 
Compared to the original sand bed, the bottom bed ashes have a wider distribution of 
particle sizes; the inert material fed mixed with the biomass is responsible for this result. 
The bottom bed ashes studied have distinct physical-chemical properties. 
The treatment by water leaching and screening improves the quality of the ashes in order to 
allow its material valorization. After leaching, the concentration of some chemical 
elements in the ashes decreased in distinct percentages, depending on the chemical element 
and the origin of the ashes. The higher percentage of concentration decrease was observed 
for Cl and S. 

Keywords: Ash, leaching, combustion, fluidized bed, biomass 

INTRODUCTION 
Fluidized bed combustion (FBC) technology is recognized as the most appropriate 
technology for biomass combustion, due to the inherent advantages of low process 
temperatures, isothermal operating conditions, and fuel flexibility. The existing FBC 
technology at industrial scale includes the bubbling fluidized bed combustors (BFBC) and 
the circulating fluidized bed combustors (CFBC). Among other characteristics, these 
technologies differ in the pattern of gas-solid hydrodynamics in the reactor, the size of the 
bed particles, the heat and mass transfer rates in the reactor, the temperature and flue gas 
composition profile along the reactor. This in turns influences the characteristics of the 
ashes produced during biomass combustion, and thus, flows of ashes with distinct 
properties will be produced in these installations. 
During biomass combustion in BFBC two main types of ashes are produced: the bottom 
bed ashes and the fly ashes. The bottom bed ashes are composed by the sand particles from 
the original (mainly quartz) sand bed, the inert material (forest soil and small stones) fed 
together with the biomass, and the biomass ash. The fly ashes are composed by the smaller 
size particles from the original sand bed, particles resulting from attrition and abrasion of 
the original sand bed particles, inert material fed with the biomass, and the biomass ash. In 
opposition to a grate furnace, where the bottom ashes represent the higher percentage of 
the total ashes produced in the installation, during BFBC the bottom bed ashes often 
represent the lower fraction of the total ashes produced in the plant; the bottom bed ash 
fraction can be of the order 5%wt [1,2], 10%wt [3], 17%wt [4], or as high as 50%wt to 
60%wt as often observed in some Portuguese thermal plants with BFBC. 



Ash Utilisation 2012, Stockhom, SWEDEN 

 

 

The bottom bed ashes during BFBC result from periodic discharges of the bed, among 
other reasons, related to: i) the need of bed renovation and replacement in order to avoid 
bed agglomeration and defluidization, ii) discharge of excess bed solids in order to 
maintain bed height, iii) the replacement by fresh natural sand with appropriate particle 
size distribution in order to guarantee proper hydrodynamic conditions of the bubbling bed. 
The discharge of bottom bed ashes originates a significant amount of solid wastes to be 
managed. The ashes from biomass combustion in thermal plants are classified as a waste 
according to the European List of Wastes [5], and the bottom bed ashes from BFBC are 
classified with code 100124. Most of the published research work dealing with bottom bed 
ashes from BFBC is related with the phenomena of bed agglomeration and defluidization, 
and less related with the environmental management and material valorization of the 
bottom bed ashes. 
The phenomenon of bed agglomeration and defluidization is an issue of major concern 
during BFBC. The reasons behind this phenomenon are associated with the formation of an 
ash coating layer around the bed particles, and are related with the Na and K and their 
combination with the Si, resulting in compounds with a relative lower melting point 
present on those layers, achieved at the low temperatures of BBFC (800ºC to 900ºC), thus 
promoting the agglomeration of the particles and subsequent defluidization of the bed [6-
20]. Nevertheless, in general, the bottom bed ash in a BFBC are composed mostly of silica 
(mostly quartz) sand particles, with particle size from the few micrometers until some 
millimeters, often containing a relatively thin (with a few micrometers) coating layer 
mainly composed of inorganic material that is found in most of the typical biomass fuels 
[21]. 
In this work are analyzed some physical-chemical properties of bottom bed ashes from 
combustion a variety of forest biomass fuels in industrial BFBC existing in Portugal. Are 
also evaluated some results of the physical-chemical treatment applied to the bottom bed 
ashes from the BFBC, in order to produce a material that can be used in industrial 
applications, as for example, in substitution of natural silica sand. 

EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY 
The experimental work developed in this study is included in a wider research project [22] 
aimed to study the characteristics of ashes produced in industrial thermal plants in 
Portugal, and to evaluate solutions for their management. The work includes the 
characterization of the ash flows in industrial thermal plants using biomass as fuel, the 
treatment of the ashes considering is material valorization, and the environmental 
management of the ashes. 
In the study presented here are analyzed results about the characteristics of bottom bed 
ashes sampled in some Portuguese industrial thermal plants with BFBC. The ashes were 
characterized for particle size distribution, chemical composition and leaching. 
It was studied the raw bottom bed ash and the mass fraction of bottom bed ash with 
particle size in the range 0.3 to 1.0 mm. The interest in this particle size fraction (0.3 to 1.0 
mm) is related with the possibility of its recycling, namely to be utilized as: i) substitute of 
part of the natural sand used for bottom bed replacement in the BFBC, and ii) as aggregate 
in construction materials. 
Figure 1 shows the main flows of ashes in thermal plants with BFBC, and also the 
proposed bottom bed ash treatment and material valorization approach under evaluation.

The bottom bed ashes studied were sampled in five BFBC, with nominal thermal capacity 
in the range 50 MWth to 100 MWth, using forest biomass residues as solid fuel. Among the 
biomass fuels used, the eucalyptus bark and the residues from logging activities are the 
major component. The typical operating conditions of the industrial BFBC include 
temperature of the bubbling bed in the range 800ºC to 900ºC, and O2 concentration in the 
flue gas in the range 4%v(dry gases) to 7%v(dry gases). 
The ash samples were collected at the discharge location of the bottom bed ash in the 
industrial BFBC plants. Each bottom bed ash sample had a mass of about 30 kg.

Bottom Bed Ash Characterization 

The bottom bed ashes samples collected were characterized for particle size distribution by 
sieving. For chemical characterization, it was selected the bottom bed ash fraction with 
particle size in the range 0.3 to 1.0 mm from three BFBC installations, considering the 
applications to be studied, as stated before. The mass fraction of the bottom bed with 
particle size in this range 0.3 to 1.0 mm can represent from 40%wt to 60%wt of the bottom 
bed ash discharged in the BFBC analyzed. It was also characterized the raw bottom bed 
ashes (with particle size below 2 mm) from one industrial BFBC. The chemical 
characterization of the bottom bed ash was performed for major and minor chemical 
elements by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), using a Panalytical Axios spectrometer. Prior to 
analysis, the bottom bed ash samples were subjected to a grinding process in an Agatha 
mill, followed by drying at 101 ºC ± 1 ºC for 12 h. The chemical analysis was performed 
considering: i) Loss on ignition (LOI), and ii) XRF analysis on a pressed pellet previously 
prepared. For LOI determination, approximately 1.5 grams of the sample, milled and dried, 
were heated to 1100 ºC for 3 hours in a Carbolite furnace; the LOI was obtained based on 
the loss of weight after the heating at 1100 ºC. The pressed pellet for XRF analysis was 
prepared with about 10 grams of milled and dried ash sample. The ash sample was mixed 
with 4 or 5 drops of polyvinyl alcohol and homogenized in a plastic recipient, and further 
pressed in a standardized form. After drying the pressed pellet is then submitted to X-Ray 
analysis. 
Some particles from the raw bottom bed ash of one BFBC and the respective particles 
resulting from its industrial leaching with water were prepared for further analysis of their

Bottom Bed Ash Leaching 

The bottom bed ash leaching was evaluated using two procedures: i) water leaching in 
laboratory, and ii) industrial water leaching. The leaching in laboratory was applied to 
three bottom bed ashes with particle size in the range 0.3 to 1.0 mm. The industrial 
leaching was applied to the raw bottom bed ashes from one industrial BFBC. 
The laboratorial leaching tests were performed according to the European Norm EN 
12457-2 [23]. Before leaching, the solid samples were pre-dried for 12 h at 105ºC ± 5ºC. 
According to this procedure, 100 grams of dry bottom bed ash sample were transferred to a 
polypropylene stopper flask and then 1 L distilled water was added; that is, leaching with 
an L/S ratio (liquid to solid ratio) equal to 10 was used. It was a batch leaching test with 
duration of 24 hours under continuous stirring in an orbital shaker (250 rpm). 
The industrial leaching was performed in continuous and under typical conditions used in 
an industry that makes treatment of natural sand for the construction industry. The leaching 
includes a continuous shower like process using a L/S (liquid to solid) ratio equal to 2, and 
a processing capacity of 10 ton/h; the process includes treatment of the leaching solution 
by sedimentation in order to reuse the liquid solution on the leaching process. 

RESULTS 

The results presented here include: i) the particle size distribution of the original sand bed 
of the BFBC (OB_1, OB_4, OB_6), and the particle size distribution of the raw bottom bed 
ashes (BA_1_R, BA_2_R, BA_4_R, BA_5_R, BA_6_R) from five industrial BFBC, ii) the 
chemical composition (determined by XRF) of the original natural sand bed (OB_4, 
OB_6), of the bottom bed particles with particle size in the range 0.3 to 1.0 mm before 
(BA_4, BA_5, BA_6) and after (BA_4_L, BA_5_L, BA_6_L) laboratorial leaching with 
water, of a raw bottom bed ash (BA_6_R) and the respective bottom bed ash after 
industrial leaching and screening (BA_6_IL). 
After industrial leaching and screening the material (BA_6_IL) to be valorized in industrial 
applications has the following particle size cumulative (lower) mass distribution: 
100%wt&lt;2.0 mm, 94.9%wt&lt;1.0, 18.9%wt&lt;0.50 mm, 0.027%wt&lt;0.25 mm, 0%wt&lt;0.063 
mm, and the chemical analysis by XRF was made on samples prepared from this particle 
size distribution. 
It is presented information about the SEM-EDS analysis of the cross section of some 
bottom bed ash particles before (BA_6_R) and after industrial leaching (BA_6_IL). 

Bottom Bed Ash Characteristics 

From the macroscopic point of view, the bottom bed ashes from BFBC that use (mainly) 
eucalyptus bark as biomass fuel are dark in color, whereas the bottom bed ash from BFBC 
that use a variety of forest biomass residues (e.g., from logging activities) are brown in 
color. The bottom bed ashes from the BFBC analyzed showed no agglomerated particles. 
The particle size distribution of the natural sand utilized as original bed and the bottom bed 
ashes discharged is shown in Figure 2, for the industrial BFBC installations studied. It is 
observed that the bottom bed ashes show a particle size distribution that is enriched with 
fine and coarse particles when compared with the original natural sand bed. Other studies 
in industrial BBFC [1,2,3,4] do not show this pattern characterized by a wide particle size

distribution. The enrichment in fine and coarse particles relative to the original sand bed, 
observed in these Portuguese BFBC installations, can be explained by the quality of the 
forest biomass residues used as fuel. The biomass used can have considerable amounts of 
inert material (forest soil particles and small stones) as has been shown in a study 
conducted in a Portuguese industrial thermal plant using similar biomass fuel [24]; this 
contamination of the biomass fuel by inert material results from bad practices during the 
biomass residues collection and management before delivering to the BFBC installation. In 
fact, the increasing mass fraction of coarse particles in the bottom bed ashes observed here 
is not related with agglomeration phenomena, because no signs of agglomeration were 
observed in the samples studied. 
From the operating perspective, there are some negative implications from the bottom bed 
enrichment in lower particle size material. For example, the lower particle size material fed 
with the biomass is composed mostly of particles from the forest soil, and its lower 
terminal velocity enhances the entrainment along the freeboard and the corresponding 
erosion of the heat exchange equipment (e.g. super-heaters). The higher particle size 
material is composed of coarse soil particles and small stones from the forest, that have 
much higher fluidization velocities than that of the particles from the original sand bed. 
This enrichment in coarse particle size influences the quality of bed fluidization, affecting 
negatively the heat and mass transfer inside the bed, and the whole performance of the 
BFBC. 
The high level of inert material (soil and small stones from the forest) fed mixed with the 
biomass in the Portuguese BFBC plants [24] implies a relatively high frequency of bottom 
bed discharge, and consequently these bottom bed ashes have low residence time (&lt;3 days) 
in the BFBC when compared with other practices in industrial installations using BFBC 
[1,2]. 
The composition of bottom bed ashes samples is shown in Figure 3, considering the loss on 
ignition (LOI) and major chemical elements, and in Figure 4 considering some minor 
chemical elements. The characteristic low value of LOI reveals the low content of organic 
matter in the bottom bed ashes, as it is usual in BFBC due to the relatively efficient 
combustion inside the bed and the low solid carbon content inside the bed during the 
combustion of high volatile matter content solid fuels as the biomass. For the bottom bed 
particles BA_4 and BA_5, the unburned material determined at 550ºC [25] was found to be 
lower than 0.40%wt (dry basis) and 0.09%wt (dry basis), respectively. The major chemical 
element present in the bottom bed ashes is Si; Oxygen not considered. The Si expressed as 
SiO2 represent about 74%wt, 72%wt, 83%wt and 85%wt of the bottom bed ashes with 
reference BA_6_R, BA_6, BA_4 and BA_5. This abundance of Si it is related with the 
natural (mostly quartz) sand (&gt;98.5%wt SiO2) used as original bottom bed in the BFBC. 
The bottom bed ashes are enriched in chemical elements (Figures 3 and 4) that can be 
found in the inorganic content of biomass [21], when compared to the original (quartz) 
sand bed. Considering the relatively high content of inert material (forest soil particles and 
small stones) fed mixed with the biomass [24], it is expected also that the bottom bed ash 
composition is influenced by the composition of that inert material.

bottom bed ashes. With exception of Ca, present in concentrations in the range 2.5%wt to 
10%wt, the other chemical elements are present in concentrations lower than 2%wt. By a 
descending order in concentration, the general pattern of abundance of major chemical 
elements in the bottom bed ashes is:

During biomass combustion the original (mostly quartz) sand bed particles become 
enriched in chemical compounds typical of the inorganic content of the biomass. This 
enrichment occurs as a coating layer of the sand particles. This process is shown in Figures 
5 and 6, where the SEM-EDS of the cross-section of a particle from the original sand bed

(OB_6), a particle from the raw bottom bed ashes discharged (BA_6_R), and from the 
leached (industrial procedure) bottom bed ashes (BA_6_IL) are presented. The coating 
layer was measured as to have less than 50 µm thickness in particles with equivalent 
diameter higher than 0.4 mm. Some of the chemical elements typical of the inorganic 
content of the biomass [21] were found in that coating layer in distinct amounts, namely 
the Si, Ca, Mg, P, Na, Al, S. In Figure 6 it is presented the location and qualitative 
abundance of some of those chemical elements in that layer, namely the Ca, K, Mg and Na. 
This enrichment in the outer layer of the bottom bed particles has been documented in the 
literature and it is related with the bed agglomeration and defluidization phenomena 
[6,7,8,9,11,12,13]. The relative amount of some of these chemical elements, namely Si, Ca, 
K, Na and Al, and it relation to the melting temperatures of some inorganic compounds 
present in that layer has been used to explain the agglomeration and defluidization 
phenomena during BFBC [6,7,17,18], and to develop measures for its prevention, as for 
example the use of additives [7,14,16,17,18]. 

Leaching of Bottom Bed Ash 

When comparing the chemical composition of the bottom bed ash samples not leached 
(BA_4, BA_5, BA_6, and BA_6_R) and leached (BA_4_L, BA_5_L, BA_6_L, and 
BA_6_R_L) it is observed that the concentration of some chemical elements, among them 
the Cl, S, Na and K, is lower in the leached samples (Figures 3 and 4); this result is 
important in the context of material valorization of the bottom bed ashes. It was calculated 
the percentage of variation in the concentration of chemical elements present in the bottom 
bed ashes samples in result of leaching; for that purpose it was used the ratio between the 
difference in concentration of (major) chemical elements in the samples not leached and in 
the leached samples, and (relative to) their concentration in the samples not leached. That 
percentage of variation reflects a decrease in concentration of some chemical elements 
present in the bottom bed ashes after leaching. The percentage of decrease in concentration 
of some chemical elements in the bottom bed ashes in result of leaching is shown in Figure 
7. This decrease in concentration can also be regarded as an indicator of the chemical 
elements removal in result of leaching. It is observed that the percentage of decrease in 
concentration is different for the distinct bottom bed ashes studied. In general, the 
percentage of decrease in concentration of (major) chemical elements in the bottom bed 
ashes with reference BA_6_L is higher than that observed for the bottom bed ashes 
BA_4_L and BA_5_L.  
As well, differences in the percentage of decrease in concentration of some chemical 
elements between the laboratorial (BA_6_L) and industrial (BA_6_IL) leaching of bottom 
bed ashes were observed; the industrial leaching shows higher percentages of decrease in 
concentration, except for Na and K. However, it is important to refer that the laboratorial 
and industrial leaching procedures had differences on: i) the particle size distribution of the 
bottom bed ashes leached, ii) the L/S ratio, iii) the pattern of solid-liquid contact, and iv) 
the leaching time. 
The chemical elements removal by leaching is influenced by the form according which the 
elements are bonded in the ashes, including the coating layer around the sand bed particles, 
and by the physical-chemical properties of the leaching solution, among them, the pH 
[26,27,28]. Distinct chemical compounds have distinct solubility. 
The chemical (major) elements that show higher percentage of decrease in concentration 
are the Cl and S (Figure 7), despite these elements are present in low concentration 



Ash Utilisation 2012, Stockhom, SWEDEN 

 

 

(&lt;0.25%wt) in the bottom bed ashes. A concentration decrease in the range 20% to 80% is 
observed for S, and in the range 40% to 80% for Cl. The presence of these chemical 
elements bound in soluble salts in the bottom bed ashes can explain the high removal level 
by leaching [26]. 
 
 

  

 
Figure 5 – Microscopic view of cross section of bed particles: original sand bed (OB_6), 

raw bottom bed (sand) particle (BA_6_R), bottom bed (sand) particle after industrial water 
leaching (BA_6_IL). 

 
The decrease in concentration of other (major) chemical elements important considering 
the material valorization of the bottom bed ashes, as for example the Na and K, was 
relatively low (&lt;7%wt) for the samples BA_4_L and BA_5_L, and in the range 20% to 
50% for BA_6_L and BA_6_IL, respectively. The samples resulting from laboratorial 
leaching showed a higher percentage of decrease in concentration of Na and K when 
compared with the industrial leaching; when analyzing the laboratorial and industrial 
leaching it is important to refer that the experimental conditions are distinct.

by SEM-EDS: bottom bed particle (BA_6_R), bottom bed particle after industrial leaching 

(BA_6_IL). 

The relatively low percentage of decrease in concentration of K and Na could be related 
with the fact that those compounds are not present mainly in the form of soluble salts, like 
the KCl or K2SO4 [26], but instead should be present as compounds with low solubility as 
for example the sodium and potassium feldspars [26], also with origin in the inert material 
(forest soil) fed mixed with the biomass. To a better understanding of this process there is 
ongoing work dealing with Energy-Dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis of the 
bottom bed ashes. 
The concentration of Mg, P and Ti in the leached sample BA_4_L was higher than in the 
non-leached sample BA_4 (Figure 3). Among other reasons, the relative lower leachability 
of these chemical elements in comparison to the other chemical elements present in the 
bottom bed ashes can explain this result; thus, after leaching the sample become enriched 
in these elements. Considering that sample replicates were used in chemical 
characterization, before and after leaching, the representativeness of the replicates is 
another issue to be considered. This subject has to be confirmed with further experiments. 
The higher concentration of Si in all the leached samples, relative to the non-leached 
samples, is justified by the lower leachability of this chemical element relative to the other 
chemical elements present; thus, after leaching the sample become enriched in this 
element. 
It was observed that the coating layer around the bottom bed sand particles it is not 
removed by water leaching, as shown in Figure 5 and 6; nevertheless, by SEM it was 
observed that the particles show a coating layer with lower thickness after leaching, as 
shown in the example of Figure 5 for a particle resulting from industrial leaching.

Characteristics of Leaching Solutions (pH and conductivity) 

The pH and conductivity values of the solutions from (laboratorial and industrial) leaching 
of bottom bed ashes are shown in Figure 8. The laboratorial leaching solutions had pH 
values in the range 11.5 to 13.0, with the higher value observed in the solution from 
leaching BA_6 (sample BA_6_L in Figure 8). The pH value of the solution from the 
industrial leaching has a lower value (pH=9.5) than those observed in the laboratorial 
leaching solutions. The high pH values are related to the alkaline characteristics of the 
ashes, and results from its content in alkali chemical elements, as for example the Na, K, 
Ca, that become dissolved in the leaching solutions. High values of pH are common of 
bottom bed ashes from industrial BFBC using biomass as fuel [3,4].

The conductivity of the leaching solutions was in the range 0.25 mS/cm to 9.7 mS/cm; the 
lower value was observed in the solution from industrial leaching of bottom ashes BA_6 
(sample BA_6_IL in Figure 8), and the higher values in the solutions from leaching bottom

ashes BA_4 and BA_6 (samples BA_4_L and BA_6_L in Figure 8). The conductivity is 
related with the concentration of dissolved ions, among those, the ions derived from alkali 
elements like Na, K, Ca, and also ions derived from Cl and S. High conductivity reveals 
high ionic strength of the solution and this is associated with high concentration of ions, 
and reflects a higher removal of alkali elements, chlorine and sulphur from the bottom bed 
ashes. In the laboratorial leaching experiments, the higher values of pH and conductivity 
where observed for the solutions from leaching bottom bed ashes from the two BFBC 
using mainly eucalyptus bark (samples BA_4_L and BA_6_L in Figure 8). For the bottom 
bed ashes from the BFBC that uses forest residues from several forest management 
activities a relatively lower value of conductivity was observed (sample with reference 
BA_5_L in Figure 8).  
When analysing the values of pH and conductivity of the solution from industrial leaching 
with those from laboratorial leaching, BA_6_L and BA_6_IL, it is important to remember 
that are distinct leaching procedures, as described previously. 

CONCLUSIONS 
In this work, bottom bed ashes from combustion of forest biomass residues in industrial 
BFBC where studied. The bottom bed ashes were characterized considering particle size 
distribution, chemical composition, and water leaching. 
Compared to the original sand bed, the bottom bed ashes have a wider distribution of 
particle sizes. The inert material fed mixed with the biomass has a major role in this 
process. In this context, the quality of the forest biomass residues used as fuel has to be 
improved, namely by removing the inert material (forest soil and small stones) that arrives 
to the thermal plant mixed with the biomass. 
It was observed that the treatment by screening and water leaching can improve the quality 
of the bottom bed ashes in order to allow its material valorization in some industrial 
applications, namely as substitute of natural sand, thus saving natural resources. 
After the leaching process the concentration of some chemical elements in the bottom bed 
ashes decreased in distinct percentages, depending on the chemical element and the origin 
of the ashes. The higher percentage of concentration decrease was observed for Cl and S.

ABSTRACT: In this work it was made the characterization of distinct ash flows in a biomass thermal 
power plant using bubbling fluidised bed technology. Bottom bed ashes differ significantly from fly 
ashes, in concern of both physical characteristics and chemical composition. It was observed a 
modification in some physical-chemical characteristics of the ashes in result of their exposition to 
atmospheric air. The pH of the distinct ash samples was alkaline, with values in range 10.3 to 12.7. The 
conductivity of the ashes varied in the range 0.9 to 19.3 mS/cm, with the fresh fly ashes from the 
electrostatic precipitator showing the higher value. During the atmospheric air exposition, a decrease in 
pH and conductivity of the ash leaching solutions was observed. Calcium was the water soluble element 
with higher concentration in the leaching solution. Due to ash exposition to atmospheric air, a decrease on 
the leaching of Ca and an increase on the Cl and Al from the fly ashes from the electrostatic precipitator 
was observed. The process of ash-atmospheric air interaction is of major importance considering the 
characterization of the ashes and their environmental management.

1 INTRODUCTION 
 
Energy resources are essential in the economy, sustainable development and in generation of prosperity for 

all countries [1, 2]. In the European Union, the utilization of renewable sources has been increased, with the 
main goals of: diversify the energy supply, reducing the dependence on fossil fuel markets and reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions [3]. For that, it was created some directives, which require national targets and 
strategies for the development of renewable energy sources and establish sustainable criteria for biomass sources 
[4]. 

Biomass is a resource always associated with environmental sustainability and climate stabilization, with 
large potential, economic viability and social and environmental benefits [2, 5, 6]. So, its use has being 
increasing during the last years and makes part of the energy strategies for several countries [5]. There are 
various sources of biomass that can be use as a fuel, some of them can be taken directly from the forest, which 
include residues from plantations, logging residues from forest management activities and extraction of wood, 
several agricultural residues, animal wastes, and other fuels derived from biological sources (e.g. sludge) [2, 5, 
6]. 

Biomass is also an important source of energy for many industries in many countries [2]. Combustion is the 
main technology for thermochemical conversion of biomass to power or/and heat at industrial level. The 
selection and design of combustion systems is determined by the environmental legislation, the characteristics of 
the fuel, the operational costs, performance of the system and the energy needs [7]. Nowadays, fluidized bed 
(FB) technology is recognize as the most appropriate for biomass combustion, due to the inherent advantages 
such as: low process temperatures, isothermal operating conditions and fuel flexibility. Two types of FB exist at 
industrial scale, the bubbling fluidized bed combustors and the circulating fluidized bed combustors. These 
technologies differ in the size of the bed particles, in the pattern of gas-solid hydrodynamics in the reactor, the 
heat and mass transfer rates in the reactor and the temperature and flue gas composition profile along the reactor 
[7-9]. 

In Portugal, several industrial sectors are intensive consumers of forest biomass, and in some of them heat 
or/and power are produced using this resources in combustion process. Some of these biomass resources are 
residues/sub-products from industrial related activities as the preparation of feedstock and operations of forest 
maintenance. On the other hand, Portuguese government established the renewable energy resources as priorities 
for energy strategy, and biomass is among these resources. 

Several operating and environmental problems are recognized during biomass combustion in fluidized beds. 
The operating problems are mainly related to bed agglomeration and defluidization, which can lead to costly and 
unscheduled shutdown of the combustors [10-12]. Among the environmental problems, those related to the ashes 
produced and its environmental management are of major concern [13, 14]. In this context, it is important to 
know in detail the physical-chemical characteristics of the ashes and how their physical-chemical properties 
change with time when exposed to environment conditions. 

Important physical-chemical properties of the ash include particle size distribution, density and porosity, 
specific surface area, pH, leaching, chemical composition, and mineralogy [8]. During fluidized bed combustion 



21th European Biomass Conference and Exhibition 2013, Copenhagen, Denmark 

 

two main flows of ashes can be identified and classified [7, 15]: bottom ashes and fly ashes. The fly ashes can be 
collected in super-heaters, economizers and air pollution control devices (cyclones, bag filters and electrostatic 
precipitators). Often, in thermal plants the distinct fly ash flows are mixed and managed together, although it is 
recognized that each ash flow has distinct characteristics [7, 8, 17, 16-28]. 

The ashes from biomass combustion are very alkaline [8, 9, 23, 25, 29] and reactive, and some modifications 
in their physical-chemical characteristics can occur, as for example carbonation [14, 30], when they are exposed 
to environmental conditions. This behavior has to be taken in consideration when studying ash management 
options, and it is also important in the context of developing appropriate characterization methodologies for the 
ashes; for example, the storage conditions applied to the ash samples prior to physical-chemical analysis can 
influence the results. 

Ash disposal in landfill has been used worldwide. However, the increasing costs and unsustainability of this 
management practice has been driving efforts in order to develop appropriate management practices for the 
ashes, e.g. the recycling of ashes to forest soil [28, 29, 31-33], and the incorporation in construction materials 
[34, 35], thus saving other natural resources often used in those applications. 

In this work it was made the characterization of distinct ash flows (bottom ashes and fly ashes (superheater, 
economizer and electrostatic precipitator)) from a biomass thermal power plant using a bubbling fluidised bed 
combustor (BFBC). The ash samples were exposed to atmospheric conditions inside a laboratory during six 
months, aiming to study the modification on the ash properties with time of atmospheric air exposure. This study 
is part of an integrated research project [36] in which characteristics of ashes from Portuguese thermal plants 
have been studied together with some alternatives of material valorization, in order to establish guidelines to a 
proper ash management. 

 
 

2 EXPERIMENTAL WORK 
 

The ashes analyzed in this study were collected in a Portuguese thermal power plant with BFBC (50 MWth). 
The thermal plant use forest biomass residues (FBR) as fuel, mostly resulting from activities related to 
eucalyptus and pinus stands exploitation for wood to several other industrial sectors. The ashes were sample 
from the bottom bed (BA), superheater (FA_SH), economizer (FA_EC) and electrostatic precipitator (stage 1 
(FA_ESP1) and stage 2 (FA_ESP2)). 

The layout of the industrial thermal power plant is shown in Fig. 1, together with the respective indication of 
location of ash samples collection point. 

The ash samples collected were exposed to atmospheric air conditions inside a laboratory during six months. 
The laboratory conditions of temperature and moisture were monitored (Fig. 2). Physical-chemical 
characterization of the ashes was done at distinct time periods: (i) fresh samples, (ii) after 1 week, (iii) after 1 
month, (iv) after 3 months (only for bottom bed ashes) and (v) after 6 months.

2.1 Methodology of ash analysis 

The ashes were characterized for some physical-chemical parameters: particle size distribution, chemical 
composition, mineralogy, and leaching characteristics (pH, conductivity and water soluble elements). 

The particle size distribution was analyzed using two methodologies: i) sieving analysis, using ASTM sieves 
and ii) Coulter analysis – LS230 (for size particles below 2 mm).

The chemical composition of the ashes was determined by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) using a Panalytical 
Axios spectrometer. Prior to analysis, the ash samples were subjected to a grinding process in an Agatha mill. 
The analysis was performed considering: i) Loss on ignition (LOI) and ii) XRF analysis on a pressed pellet 
previously prepared. For LOI determination, approximately 1.5 grams of the sample milled were dried, and 
heated to 1100ºC for 3 hours in a Carbolite furnace. The LOI was obtained based on the loss of weight after the 
heating at 1100ºC. A pressed pellet for XRF analysis was prepared with proximately 10 grams of milled and 
dried ash sample. The ash sample was mixed with 4 or 5 drops of polyvinyl alcohol and homogenized in a plastic 
recipient, and further pressed in a standardized form. After drying, the pressed pellet was analyzed by XRF. 

The mineralogy composition of the ashes was determined by X-Ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku 
Geigerflex diffractometer D/max-Series, power 40kV/30mA, scan mode continuous/speed – 3º/min). 

The water leaching was performed according the European Norm EN 12457-2 [37]. The pH and the 
conductivity of solutions were measured after 24h leaching. The chemical analysis of the leaching solutions was 
performed using Flame Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (FAAS) (for Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe), Inductively Coupled 
Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) (for As, Cd, Mn, Pb, Mo, Ni), Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic 
Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (for Al, Zn, Ba, B, Cr, Sr, Cu, P), and Chloride-selective Ion Electrode 
method for Cl (analyzed as chloride (Cl-)). 

 
3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 
The particle size distribution (mass distribution) of the bottom bed ashes and fly ashes determined by sieving 

is shown in Fig. 3. It is observed that the bottom bed ash shows a particle size distribution enriched in coarse 
particles when compared to the fly ashes. A decreased in the particle size from bottom bed ash to the 
electrostatic precipitator ashes (FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2) it is observed. 

The average particle size (volume basis), determined by Coulter analysis (Figure 4) shows the same pattern 
as that observed by sieving. It is important to state that for this analysis only the bottom ash particles below 2m 
were considered. The FBR used as fuel in Portugal in thermal plants has considerable amounts of inert material, 
such as soil particles and small stones [25], and that influences the physical-characteristics of the ashes produced 
in the thermal plant. The chemical composition of ashes is shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, for LOI, and major and 
minor chemical elements. It is observed a clear difference between the composition of BA, FA_SH, FA_EC, and 
the FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2. The LOI is below 0.5%wt (dry basis) for the BA, and for fly ashes the LOI 
increases from FA_SH and FA-EC (below 1%wt, dry basis) to FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2.

The unburned content of ashes (determined at 550ºC, procedure adpated from standard CEN/TS 14775:2004 
[39]) revealed a loss on weight lower than 0.1%wt for BA, below 0.5%wt for FA_SH and FA_EC and below 
1.5%wt for FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2. These show that the amount of organic content present in the ashes is 
relatively low, which confirm a high efficiency of fuel conversion in the furnace. The increase in unburned 
material content from BA to FA_ESP2 is explained in result of the fact that the high temperature of bottom bed 
allows a high conversion of the fuel, and the low particle size and density of some fuel particles under 
combustion are transported with the fuel gases through the furnace and collected at the air pollution control 
equipment (electrostatic precipitator). The higher values of LOI determined at 1100ºC compared with the 
unburned material content determined at 550ºC show the contribution of thermal decomposition and 
volatilization of other components than unburned fuel (organic material) in the ashes.

Figure 5: Major chemical elements in the ash samples collected at distinct locations along the thermal plant, 

values expressed in %wt (dry basis (db)). Legend according to locations in the plant as shown in Fig. 1. 

Bottom ash and fly ashes from superheater and economizer are enriched in Si when compared to fly ashes 
from electrostatic precipitator (Fig. 5); this result is also verified by mineralogy analysis (Fig. 7). The mineralogy 
analysis shows a higher intensity of Si in these ashes, present mainly as quartz (SiO2). The high content of Si in 
the bottom ash is explained by the original bed material used (sand with more than 98.5%wt, dry basis of SiO2) 
and the inert material (forest soil an stones) fed mixed with the FBR used as fuel. 

Fly ashes from electrostatic precipitator also show Si as the chemical element with higher concentration. 
However, it is observed enrichment in other chemical elements typical of the inorganic content of the biomass, 
such as: Na, Mg, Al, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti and Fe when compared with the other ash flows. The contribution of fine 
particles carried out with the combustion flue gases, which include the chemical elements typical of the 
inorganic content of biomass [40, 41] can explained this result. The second more abundant chemical element 
present in the FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2 ashes is Ca. Cl and S are present in higher concentrations in the 
FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2 when compared to bottom ashes, and this result can be explained by the higher 
contribution from the inorganic content of the biomass to the fly ashes. Also, the physical-chemical 
characteristics of FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2, manly the high calcium content (Fig. 5), allows the adsorption of 
some gas phase chlorine and sulfur released (HCL and SO2) during the combustion of biomass.

In general, the concentration of minor chemical elements analyzed increases from BA to FA_ESP1 and 
FA_ESP2 (Fig. 6). Barium is the minor chemical element presents in higher concentration in the ashes, followed 
by Sr, Zn, Zr and Rb. Some elements, such Co (5.8-7.3 ppm), As (18.5-26.5 ppm), Cd (4.4 ppm), I (7.4-7.8 
ppm), Se (1.0-1.2 ppm), Sb (4.1-4.5 ppm) were only found in the electrostatic precipitator fly ashes (Fig. 6).  
The presence of these elements only in fly ashes can be explained in result of the contribution of inorganic 
content of the biomass; it is known that distinct amounts of these minor chemical elements can be found in 
biomass fuels [40, 41].

X-Ray Diffraction of fresh ash samples show four main phases: quartz, calcite, portlandite and anorthoclase 
(Fig. 7); these compounds are usual in ashes from biomass combustion. In bottom ash (BA), the main component 
is quartz, which is in agreement with the X-Ray Fluorescence results and with the characteristics of the original 
sand bed [25], and small amounts of potassium feldspars (microcline) are present, and this can be explained as 
resulting from the inert material (forest soil) fed with biomass and with the existence of those crystalline phases 
in the biomass ash [40, 42]. In the distinct fresh fly ashes, quartz is the most abundant crystalline phase; 
however, its abundance decreases from FA_SH to the FA_ESP2. Fly ashes from electrostatic precipitator present 
other crystalline phases (Fig. 7) typical from the biomass ash [40, 42], with different abundance. 

An important characteristic of ashes from biomass combustion biomass is their high concentration in plant 
nutrients [24]. The water leaching of ash works as an indicator of the soluble chemical elements that can be 
released from ash to the soil. 

Water leaching depends on the characteristics of ashes, and also on the reactions that can occur during the 
process. In this context, the fresh ashes and air exposed ashes can behave in a distinct way. Some ashes have 
cementious characteristics in presence of moderate amounts of water; some hydrated minerals (ettringite, 
portlandite and calcite) and calcium silicates, aluminate-hydrates and gypsum could be formed during the 
process [14]. The formation of these new phases in the ashes affects the solubility and leaching of chemical 
elements present in the ashes. 

The XRD results show that some modifications occur in the ash material in result of air exposition. Those 
modifications are mainly observed in the fly ashes (Fig. 7); the increase in the amount of calcite observed in the 
fly ashes after 6-moths air exposition (6m) is an evident modification. Portlandite (Ca(OH)2) is formed by 
hydration of CaO present in fresh ashes, as a result of interaction o air moisture with the CaO, and then reacts 
with the CO2 presents in the atmospheric air and produces calcite [14, 30] according to reaction 1: 

( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) OHcrCaCOaqCOaqOHCacrOHCa 23222)( +?+?  (1 
 
The formation of calcium carbonate (calcite) is one of most important phenomena related to the self-

hardening process of biomass ash [14, 43]. 
The pH, conductivity and release of chemical elements upon water leaching are given in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. 

These characteristics were evaluated along distinct time periods of exposition of the ashes to atmospheric air. 
 

 
Figure 8: pH of the leaching solution; leaching according standard EN 12457-2 [37]. The pH of the leaching 

solutions was measured at a temperature of 23.0±2.2ºC. X-axis titles according to ash sampling locations in the 
thermal plant as shown in Fig. 1. Legend: fs-fresh sample, 1w-one week of air exposition, 1m- one month of air 

exposition, 3m- three months of air exposition (only for bottom ash), 6m-six month of air exposition. 
 
The water leaching (standard EN 12457-2 [37]) of fresh ash samples originates alkaline solutions, with pH in 

the range 12 a 12.7. The pH increases from the bottom ash to the fly ash from electrostatic precipitator (Fig. 8), 
and this can be explained as related with the chemical composition of the ashes, namely the higher alkali content 
of the ashes from electrostatic precipitator (Fig. 5). 

The conductivity of fresh ash samples varies in the range 5 to 19 mS/cm (Fig. 9), and increases from the BA 
to the FA_ESP2 ashes. The conductivity is related with the concentration of dissolved ions, among those, the 
ions derived from alkali elements like Na, K, Ca, and also ions derived from Cl and S. Higher conductivity 
reveals higher ionic strength of the solution and this is associated with higher concentration of ions, thus 
reflecting a higher solubility of alkali elements, chlorine and sulphur from the fly ashes, when compared to the 
observed for FA_BA, FA_SH and FA_EC. 

In general, it was observed that pH and conductivity of the ash leaching solutions decreased with the time of 
air exposition of ashes; that decrease is higher in the case of FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2, and this result could be

related with the formation of new crystalline phases (Fig. 7), e.g. as calcium carbonate, which reduces the 
solubility of some chemical elements present in the ashes [14]. 

 

 
 
Figure 8: Conductivity of the leaching solution; leaching according standard EN 12457-2 [37]. The conductivity 
of the leaching solutions was measured at a temperature of 23.0±2.2ºC. X-axis titles according to ash sampling 
locations in the thermal plant as shown in Fig. 1. Legend: fs-fresh sample, 1w-one week of air exposition, 1m- 

one month of air exposition, 3m- three months of air exposition (only for bottom ash), 6m-six month of air 
exposition. 

 
The major chemical elements present in the ash leaching solutions are shown in Fig. 9. Calcium is the 

element present in higher concentration in the leaching solution of fresh ash samples. Leaching solutions of 
FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2 show the higher concentration of calcium and potassium, and this can be explained by 
the fact that these two ashes present a higher concentration of calcium and potassium (Fig. 5). 

In general, in result of exposition of the ashes to atmospheric air it is observed a decreased in the 
concentration of calcium in all leaching solutions. This can be caused by the decrease of solubility of calcium 
compounds, due to the formation of compounds as calcite, which are less soluble than other Ca-based 
compounds as CaO. On the other hand, it is observed a significant increase in concentration of chlorine 
(determined as Cl-) in the leaching solution of FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2 exposed to air during a period of six 
months; although observed also for the other ash fractions after six month of exposition, the effect is less 
pronounced that that observed for FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2. This can only be explained in result of modifications 
on the forms according which chlorine is bounded in the ashes, thus becoming more soluble with time. 

The concentration of aluminum in the leaching solution of fresh ash sample of bottom ash is significant 
higher than in the leaching solutions of fly ashes, although this chemical element is present in higher 
concentration in the fly ashes (Fig. 5); the reasons behind this behavior can be the more or less soluble forms 
according which this element is bound in the ashes. 

The minor chemical elements present in the leaching solutions are shown in Fig. 9. Among those, Ba and Sr 
are the elements present in higher concentration in the leaching solution of fresh ash samples. Barium varied 
between 1.8 mg/kg of ash in the FA_ESP2 and 6 mg/kg of ash in the FA_EC leaching solution. The 
concentration of Sr in the leaching solutions varied in a range of 3.4 to 41.8 mg/kg of ash, being the FA_ESP2 
leaching solution which presented the highest concentration. 

During air exposition of ashes the concentration of Zn, Ba and Sr decreased, mainly for the case of FA_ESP1 
and FA_ESP2. On the other hand, the concentration of B in the leaching solutions of BA, FA_ESP1 and 
FA_ESP2 increase during the air exposition (Fig.9).  

Some elements, such as As (0.02-0.03 mg/kg of ash) and Cd (3.4x10-4-1.8x10-3 mg/kg of ash) only were 
measured in leaching solution of fly ashes from electrostatic precipitator, and their concentration did not change 
during air exposition. The presence of those elements only in these ashes can be explained by the fact that the 
FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2 present a higher concentration (6) of minor chemical elements than BA, FA_SH and 
FA_EC.

Figure 9: Minor chemical elements present in the leaching solution from ash samples collected at distinct 
locations along the thermal plant ((a) Bottom ash (BA), (b) Fly ash from superheater (FA_SH), (c) Fly ash from 

economizer (FA_EC), (d) Fly ash from electrostatic precipitator stage one (FA_ESP1), and (e) Fly ash from 
electrostatic precipitator stage two (FA_ESP2)), for fresh ash samples and ash samples after distinct time periods 

of exposition to atmospheric air. 
 
4 CONCLUSIONS 

Different ash flows from a biomass thermal power plant were collected and exposed to atmospheric 
conditions under laboratory conditions during six months. Some physical and chemical characteristics of the ash 
flows were analyzed. Bottom ash shows particle size distribution enriched in coarse particles when compared 
with fly ashes. This result is mainly due to the biomass used as fuel, because this it has considerable amounts of 
inert material, such as soil particles and small stones. An important difference between the chemical composition 
of distinct ash flows was observed. The LOI increases from bottom bed ashes to fly ashes from electrostatic 
precipitator. The higher values of LOI for FA_ESP1 and FA_ESP2 were related not only with the unburned

material content but also with the thermal decomposition and volatilization of components, such as alkaline 
elements present in those ashes. Enrichment in compounds of silicon was observed for bottom ash, fly ash from 
superheater and economizer. The high content of silicon in the ashes is explained by the original material used as 
bed and by the inert material feed with the biomass that is dragged with the combustion flue gases.  

Fly ashes from electrostatic precipitator show the silicon as the chemical element with the higher 
concentration, followed by calcium. However, enrichment in elements such as sodium, magnesium, calcium and 
potassium was observed. This result is related to the contribution of fine particles constituted by chemical 
elements of the inorganic content of biomass, which were carried out with the combustion flue gases. The 
concentration of minor chemical elements increased from bottom ash to fly ash from electrostatic precipitator. 
Barium was the minor chemical element with higher concentration in ashes. The abundance of these elements in 
the fly ash from electrostatic precipitator is due to the contribution of inorganic content of biomass released 
during the combustion. As a result of the atmospheric air exposition, a modification in the mineralogy of ashes 
was observed, mainly for the fly ashes, with the appearance of compounds such as calcite. The formation of 
those compounds is a result of self-hardening and carbonation of the ashes due to the atmospheric carbon 
dioxide. These changes in the mineralogy, promote a decrease on the solubility of the chemical elements, and a 
decrease on pH and conductivity during the air exposition. Calcium was the major water soluble element with 
higher concentration in the leaching solution, followed by potassium, sodium and chloride. A decrease on the 
leaching of calcium from the ash samples exposed to air conditions was noted. A possible explanation can be the 
decrease of solubility of calcium compounds, due to the formation of compounds as calcite which are less 
soluble than other Ca-base (such as CaO). 

A significant increase in the concentration of chloride in the leaching solution of fly ashes from the 
electrostatic precipitator exposed to air during a period of six months was observed. This can be explained by 
modifications in which Cl is bounded in the ashes, which becoming more soluble with time.  

Ba and Sr were the minor water soluble elements with higher concentration in the leaching solutions of ashes. 
During air exposition their concentrations decrease. This can be due to the forms in which those elements are 
bounded in the ashes, which becoming more insoluble with time.  

The results observed in this study, show that the process of ash - atmospheric air interaction is of major 
importance considering the characterization of the ashes and their environmental management. The relevance of 
this process appears to be dependent on the ash characteristics, and a deep understanding of this phenomenon is 
needed in the perspective of material valorization of ashes.
